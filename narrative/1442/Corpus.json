On their way to the Seaton Mansion, Brian stops at Warren Tyler's house to pick up his father, Bartholomew Seaton, and at the same time shows Ned a portrait of his late mother, Danielle Seaton, by the famous artist Lucien Beaulieu. The painting is in the possession of Mr. Tyler since he found it in a barn he bought.\nThe friends leave for Seaton Mansion or \"The Bat Hallow\". They wear fancy dress for the Mardi Gras celebration. Later that evening they go to the Silver Yacht Club. That night the portrait is stolen. The prime suspect is Mr. Seaton, who is supposed to have wanted his wife's portrait. All the evidence points to him: he was wearing a bat costume, like the thief, and he was missing at the crucial time, around 10:00\u00c2\u00a0p.m.\nNancy cannot resist the challenge of the mystery. Her investigation leads to the French Quarter where she sees a woman who looks like Danielle except that her face is scarred. She is shocked and hypothesizes that Danielle could have survived the sailboat accident.\nLater she finds out the woman is Mariel Devereaux, whose father Max is an art forger. Nancy concludes that Max used his daughter as a model for the painting because of her almost perfect resemblance to Danielle. He purposely left it in the barn so that it would be found by Mr. Tyler, Danielle's suitor and Bartholomew's rival. His plan was to steal his own painting and ransom it for a million dollars. The money was to pay for his daughter's plastic surgery.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of The Mardi Gras Mystery, by H.

Half an hour he had been\nwaiting here in the lounge room for Dr. Cyril Ansley, a middle-aged\nbachelor who had practised in Opelousas for twenty years, and who had\ncome to the city for the Mardi Gras festivities. Another man might have\nseemed irritated by the wait, but Jachin Fell was quite unruffled.\n\nHe had much the air of a clerk. His features were thin and unremarkable;\nhis pale eyes constantly wore an expression of wondering aloofness, as\nthough he saw around him much that he vainly tried to understand. In his\nentire manner was a shy reticence. He was no clerk, however, this was\nevident from his attire. He was garbed from head to foot in soberly\nblending shades of gray whose richness was notable only at close view.\nOne fancied him a very precise sort of man, an old maid of the wrong\nsex.\n\nDoctor Ansley, an Inverness flung over his evening clothes, entered the\nlounge room, and Fell turned to him with a dry, toneless chuckle.\n\n\"You're the limit! Did you forget we were going to the Maillards'\nto-night?\"\n\nAnsley appeared vexed and irritated. \"Confound it, Fell!\" he exclaimed.\n\"I've been all over town looking for El Reys. Caught in a crowd--no El\nReys yet!\"\n\nAgain Fell uttered his toneless chuckle. His voice was absolutely level,\nunmarked by any change of inflection.\n\n\"My dear fellow, there are only three places in the city that can afford\nto carry El Reys in these parlous times! This club, however, happens to\nbe one of the three. Here, sit down and forget your troubles over a real\nsmoke! We need not leave for fifteen minutes yet, at least.\"\n\nDoctor Ansley laid aside his cape, stick, and hat, and dropped into one\nof the comfortable big chairs. He accepted the proffered cigar with a\nsigh. Across his knees he laid an evening paper, whose flaring headlines\nproclaimed an extra.\n\n\"I suppose you've been gadding all around the town ever since the\nRevellers opened the season?\" he inquired.\n\n\"Hardly,\" said Fell with his shy air. \"I'm growing a bit stiff with age,\nas Eliza said when she crossed the ice. I don't gad much.\"\n\n\"You intend to mask for the Maillards'?\" Ansley cast his eye over the\ngray business attire of the little man.\n\n\"I never mask.\" Jachin Fell shook his head. \"I'll get a domino and go as\nI am. Excuse me--I'll order a domino now, and also provide a few more El\nReys for the evening. Back in a moment.\"\n\nDoctor Ansley, who was himself a non-resident member of the club and\nsocially prominent when he could grant himself leisure for society,\nfollowed the slight figure of the other man with speculative eyes. Well\nas he knew Jachin Fell, he invariably found the man a source of puzzled\nspeculation.\n\nDuring many years Jachin Fell had been a member of the most exclusive\nNew Orleans clubs. He was even received in the inner circles of Creole\nsociety, which in itself was evidence supreme as to his position. At\nthis particular club he was famed as a wizard master of chess. He never\nentered a tournament, yet he consistently defeated the champions in\nprivate matches--defeated them with a bewildering ease, a shy and\napologetic ease, an ease which left the beholders incredulous and\naghast.\n\nWith all this, Jachin Fell was very much of a mystery, even among his\nclosest friends. Very little was known of him; he was inconspicuous to a\ndegree, and it was usually assumed that he was something of a recluse,\nthe result of a thwarted love affair in his youth. He was a lawyer, and\ncertainly maintained offices in the Maison Blanche building, but he\nnever appeared in the courts and no case of his pleading was known.\n\nIt was said that he lived in the rebuilt casa of some old Spanish\ngrandee in the Vieux Carre, and that this residence of his was a\nveritable treasure-trove of historic and beautiful things. This was mere\nrumour, adding a spice of romance to the general mystery. Ansley knew\nhim as well as did most men, and Ansley knew of a few who could boast of\nhaving been a guest in Jachin Fell's home. There was a mother, an\ninvalid of whom Fell sometimes spoke and to whom he appeared to devote\nhimself. The family, an old one in the city, promised to die out with\nJachin Fell.\n\nAnsley puffed at his cigar and considered these things. Outside, in the\nNew Orleans streets, was rocketing the mad mirth of carnival. The week\npreceding Mardi Gras was at its close. Since the beginning of the new\nyear the festival had been celebrated in a steadily climaxing series of\nballs and entertainments, largely by the older families who kept to the\nold customs, and to a smaller extent by society at large. Now the final\nweek was at hand, or rather the final three days--the period of the\ngreat balls, the period when tourists were flooding into town; for\ntourists, the whole time of Mardi Gras was comprised within these three\ndays. Despite agonized predictions, prohibition had not adversely\naffected Mardi Gras or the gaiety of its celebration.\n\nNow, as ever, was Mardi Gras symbolized by masques. In New Orleans the\nmasquerade was not the pale and pitiful frolic of colder climes, where\nthe occasion is but one for display of jewels and costumes, and where\nactual concealment of identity is a farce. Here in New Orleans were\njewels and costumes in a profusion of splendour; but here was preserved\nthe underlying idea of the masque itself--that in concealment of\nidentity lay the life of the thing! Masquers swept the streets gaily; if\nharlequin husband flirted with domino wife--why, so much the merrier!\nThere was little harm in the Latin masque, and great mirth.\n\nWhen Jachin Fell returned and lighted his cigar he sank into one of the\nluxurious chairs beside Ansley and indicated the newspaper lying across\nthe latter's knee, its flaring headlines standing out blackly.\n\n\"What's that about the Midnight Masquer? He's not appeared again?\"\n\n\"What?\" Ansley glanced at him in surprise. \"You've not heard?\"\n\nFell shook his head. \"I seldom read the papers.\"\n\n\"Good heavens, man! He showed up last night at the Lapeyrouse dance, two\nminutes before midnight, as usual! A detective had been engaged, but was\nafterward found locked in a closet, bound with his own handcuffs. The\nMasquer wore his usual costume--and went through the party famously,\nstripping everyone in sight. Then he backed through the doors and\nvanished. How he got in they can't imagine; where he went they can't\nimagine, unless it was by airplane. He simply appeared, then vanished!\"\n\nFell settled deeper into his chair, pointed his cigar at the ceiling,\nand sighed.\n\n\"Ah, most interesting! The loot was valued at about a hundred thousand?\"\n\n\"I thought you said you'd not heard of it?\" demanded Ansley.\n\nFell laughed softly and shyly. \"I didn't. I merely hazarded a guess.\"\n\n\"Wizard!\" The doctor laughed in unison. \"Yes, about that amount.\nExaggerated, of course; still, there were jewels of great value----\"\n\n\"The Masquer is a piker,\" observed Fell, in his toneless voice.\n\n\"Eh? A piker--when he can make a hundred-thousand-dollar haul?\"\n\n\"Don't dream that those figures represent value, Doctor. They don't! All\nthe loot the Masquer has taken since he began work is worth little to\nhim. Jewels are hard to sell. This game of banditry is romantic, but\nit's out of date these days. Of course, the crook has obtained a bit of\nmoney, but not enough to be worth the risk.\"\n\n\"Yet he has got quite a bit,\" returned Ansley, thoughtfully. \"All the\nmen have money, naturally; we don't want to find ourselves bare at some\ngay carnival moment! I'll warrant you've a hundred or so in your pocket\nright now!\"\n\n\"Not I,\" rejoined Fell, calmly. \"One ten-dollar bill. Also I left my\nwatch at home. And I'm not dressed; I don't care to lose my pearl\nstuds.\"\n\n\"Eh?\" Ansley frowned. \"What do you mean?\"\n\nJachin Fell took a folded paper from his pocket and handed it to the\nphysician.\n\n\"I met Maillard at the bank this morning. He called me into his office\nand handed me this--he had just received it in the mail.\"\n\nDoctor Ansley opened the folded paper; an exclamation broke from him as\nhe read the note, which was addressed to their host of the evening.\n\n    JOSEPH MAILLARD, President,\n        Exeter National Bank, City.\n\n    I thank you for the masque you are giving to-night. I shall be\n    present. Please see that Mrs. M. wears her diamonds--I need\n    them.\n\n                                           THE MIDNIGHT MASQUER.\n\nAnsley glanced up. \"What's this--some hoax? Some carnival jest?\"\n\n\"Maillard pretended to think so.\" Fell shrugged his shoulders as he\nrepocketed the note. \"But he was nervous. He was afraid of being laughed\nat, and wouldn't go to the police. But he'll have a brace of detectives\ninside the house to-night, and others outside.\"\n\nEver since the first ball of the year by the Twelfth Night Club this\nMidnight Masquer, as he was termed, had held New Orleans gripped in\nterror, fascination, and vivid interest. Until a month previous to this\nweek of Mardi Gras he had operated rarely; he had robbed with a stark\nand inelegant forcefulness, a brutality. Suddenly his methods\nchanged--he appeared and transacted his business with a romantic\ncourtesy, a daredevil gaiety; his robberies became bizarre and\nextraordinary.\n\nDuring the past month he appeared at least once a week, now at some\nprivate ball, now at some restaurant banquet, but always in the same\ngarb: the helmet, huge goggles and mask, and leathern clothes of a\nservice aviator. On these occasions the throbbing roar of an airplane\nmotor had been reported so that it was popular gossip that he landed on\nthe roof of his designated victims and made his getaway in the same\nmanner--by airplane. No machine had ever been seen, and the theory was\nbelieved by some, hooted at by others.\n\nThe police were helpless. The Midnight Masquer laughed openly at them\nand conducted his depredations with brazen unconcern, appearing where he\nwas least expected. The anti-administration papers were clamouring about\na \"crime wave\" and \"organization of crooks,\" but without any visible\nbasis for such clamours. The Midnight Masquer worked alone.\n\nDoctor Ansley glanced at his watch, and deposited his cigar in an ash\ntray.\n\n\"We'd best be moving, Fell. You'll want a domino?\"\n\n\"I ordered one when I got my cigars. It'll be here in a minute.\"\n\n\"Do you seriously think that note is genuine?\"\n\nFell shrugged lightly. \"Who knows? I'm not worried. Maillard can afford\nto be robbed. It will be interesting to see how he takes it if the\nfellow does show up.\"\n\n\"You're a calm one!\" Ansley chuckled. \"Oh, I believe the prince is to be\nthere to-night. You've met him, I suppose?\"\n\n\"No. I've had a rush of business lately, as Eliza said when she crossed\nthe ice: haven't gone out much. Heard something about him, though. An\nAmerican, isn't he? They say he's become quite popular in town.\"\n\nAnsley nodded. \"Quite a fine chap. His mother was an American--she\nmarried the Prince de Gramont; an international affair of the past\ngeneration. De Gramont led her a dog's life, I hear, until he was killed\nin a duel. She lived in Paris with the boy, sent him to school here at\nhome, and he was at Yale when the war broke. He was technically a French\nsubject, so he went back to serve his time.\n\n\"Still, he's an American now. Calls himself Henry Gramont, and would\ndrop the prince stuff altogether if these French people around here\nwould let him. He's supposed to be going into some kind of business, but\njust now he's having the time of his life. Every old dowager is trying\nto catch him.\"\n\nJachin Fell nodded. \"I've no use for nobility; a rotten crowd! But this\nchap appears interesting. I'll be glad to size him up. Ah, here's my\ndomino now!\"\n\nA page brought the domino. Fell, discarding the mask, threw the domino\nabout his shoulders, and the two men left the club in company.\n\nThey sought their destination afoot--the home of the banker Joseph\nMaillard. The streets were riotous, filled with an eddying, laughing\ncrowd of masquers and merrymakers of all ages and sexes; confetti\ntwirled through the air, horns were deafening, and laughing voices rose\ninto sharp screams of unrestrained delight.\n\nHere and there appeared the rather constrained figures of tourists from\nthe North. These, staid and unable to throw themselves into the utter\nabandon of this carnival spirit, could but stare in perplexed wonder at\nthe scene, so alien to them, while they marvelled at the gaiety of these\nSouthern folk who could go so far with liberty and yet not overstep the\nbounds of license.\n\nAt last gaining St. Charles Avenue, with the Maillard residence a\nhalf-dozen blocks distant, the two companions found themselves well away\nfrom the main carnival throngs. Even here, however, was no lack of\nrevellers afoot for the evening--stray flotsam of the downtown crowds,\nor members of neighbourhood gatherings on their way to entertainment.\n\nAs the two walked along they were suddenly aware of a lithe figure\napproaching from the rear; with a running leap and an exclamation of\ndelight the figure forced itself in between them, grasping an arm of\neither man, and a bantering voice broke in upon their train of talk.\n\n\"Forfeit!\" it cried. \"Forfeit--where are your masks, sober gentlemen?\nThis grave physician may be pardoned, but not a domino who refuses to\nmask! And for forfeit you shall be my escort and take me whither you are\ngoing.\"\n\nLaughing, the two fell into step, glancing at the gay figure between\nthem. A Columbine, she was both cloaked and masked. Encircling her hair\nwas a magnificent scarf shot with metal designs of solid gold--a most\nunusual thing. Also, from her words it was evident that she had\nrecognized them.\n\n\"Willingly, fair Columbine,\" responded Fell in his dry and unimpassioned\ntone of voice. \"We shall be most happy, indeed, to protect and take you\nwith us----\"\n\n\"So far as the door, at least,\" interrupted Ansley, with evident\ncaution. But Fell drily laughed aside this wary limitation.\n\n\"Nay, good physician, farther!\" went on Fell. \"Our Columbine has an\nexcellent passport, I assure you. This gauzy scarf about her raven\ntresses was woven for the good Queen Hortense, and I would venture a\nrandom guess that, clasped about her slender throat, lies the queen's\ncollar of star sapphires----\"\n\n\"Oh!\" From the Columbine broke a cry of warning and swift dismay. \"Don't\nyou dare speak my name, sir--don't you dare!\"\n\nFell assented with a chuckle, and subsided.\n\nAnsley regarded his two companions with sidelong curiosity. He could not\nrecognize Columbine, and he could not tell whether Fell were speaking of\nthe scarf and jewels in jest or earnest. Such historic things were not\nuncommon in New Orleans, yet Ansley never heard of these particular\ntreasures. However, it seemed that Fell knew their companion, and\naccepted her as a fellow guest at the Maillard house.\n\n\"What are you doing out on the streets alone?\" demanded Fell, suddenly.\n\"Haven't you any friends or relatives to take care of you?\"\n\nColumbine's laughter pealed out, and she pressed Fell's arm confidingly.\n\n\"Have I not some little rights in the world, monsieur?\" she said in\nFrench. \"I have been mingling with the dear crowds and enjoying them,\nbefore I go to be buried in the dull splendours of the rich man's house.\nTell me, do you think that the Midnight Masquer will make an appearance\nto-night?\"\n\n\"I have every reason to believe that he will,\" said Jachin Fell,\ngravely.\n\nColumbine put one hand to her throat, and shivered a trifle.\n\n\"You--you really think so? You are not trying to frighten me?\" Her voice\nwas no longer gay. \"But--the jewels----\"\n\n\"Wear them, wear them!\" There was command in the tone of Fell. \"Were\nthey not given you to wear to-night? Then wear them, by all means. Don't\nworry, my dear.\"\n\nColumbine said nothing for a moment; her gaiety seemed to be suddenly\nextinguished and quenched. Ansley was wondering uneasily at the\nconstraint, when at length she broke the silence.\n\n\"Since you have ordered, let the command be obeyed!\" She essayed a\nlaugh, which appeared rather forced. \"Yet, if they are lost and are\ntaken by the Masquer----\"\n\n\"In that case,\" said Fell, \"let the blame be mine entirely. If they are\nlost, little Columbine, others will be lost with them, fear not! I think\nthat this party would be a rich haul for the Masquer, eh? Take the rich\nman and his friends--they could bear plucking, that crowd! Rogues all.\"\n\n\"Confound you, Fell!\" exclaimed Ansley, uneasily. \"If the bandit does\nshow up there would be the very devil to pay!\"\n\n\"And Maillard would do the paying.\" Fell's dry chuckle held a note of\nbitterness. \"Let him. Who cares? Look at his house, there, blazing with\nlights. Who pays for those lights? The people his financial tentacles\nhave closed their sucker-like grip upon. His wife's jewels have been\npurchased with the coin of oppression and injustice. His son's life is\none of roguery and drunken wildness----\"\n\n\"Man, are you mad?\" Ansley indicated the Columbine between them. \"We're\nnot alone here--you must not talk that way----\"\n\nJachin Fell only chuckled again. Columbine's laugh broke in with renewed\ngaiety:\n\n\"Nonsense, my dear Galen! We surely may be allowed to be ourselves\nduring carnival! Away with the heresies of hypocritical society. Our\nfriend speaks the sober truth. We masquers may admit among ourselves\nthat Bob Maillard is----\"\n\n\"Is not the man we would have our daughters marry, provided we had\ndaughters,\" said Fell. Then he gestured toward the house ahead of them,\nand his tone changed: \"Still, now that we are about to enter that house,\nwe must remind ourselves of courtesy and the limitations of guests. Say\nno more. Produce your invitation, Columbine, for I think we shall find\nthat the doors to-night are guarded by Cerberus.\"\n\nThey had come to a file of limousines and cars, and approached the\ngateway of the Maillard home. They turned into the gate.\n\nThe house loomed before them, a great house set amid gardens, stately in\nthe fashion of olden days. The lower floors were discreetly darkened to\nthe streets, but on the upper floor, where was the ballroom with its\nfloor of cypress, there was a glitter of bright lights and open windows.\nMusic drifted to them as they approached. Jachin Fell touched the arm of\nAnsley and indicated an inconspicuous figure to one side of the entrance\nsteps.\n\n\"An outer guardian,\" he murmured. \"Our host, it seems, is neglecting no\nprecaution! I feel sorry for the Masquer, if he appears here.\"\n\nThey came to the doorway. Columbine produced an invitation, duly\nnumbered, and the three entered the house together.\n\n\n\n\n                               CHAPTER II\n\n                               _Masquers_\n\n\nJoseph Maillard might have hopefully considered the note from the\nMidnight Masquer to be a hoax perpetrated by some of his friends, but he\ntook no chances. Two detectives were posted in the grounds outside the\nhouse; inside, two others, masked and costumed, were keeping a quietly\nefficient eye on all that transpired.\n\nEach guest upon entering was conducted directly to the presence of\nJoseph Maillard himself, or of his wife; was bidden to unmask in this\nprivate audience, and was then presented with a favour and sent forth\nmasked anew to the festivities. These favours were concealed, in the\ncase of the ladies, in corsage bouquets; in that of the men, inside\nfalse cigars. There was to be a general opening of the favours at\nmidnight, the time set for unmasking. All this ceremony was regarded by\nthe guests as a delightful innovation, and by Joseph Maillard as a\ndelightful way of assuring himself that only the invited guests entered\nhis house. Invitations might be forged--faces, never!\n\nLucie Ledanois entered the presence of her stately relative, and after\nunmasking, dutifully exchanged kisses with Mrs. Maillard. Until some\nmonths previously, until she had come into the management of her own\nproperty--or what was left of it--Lucie had been the ward of the\nMaillards. Their former attitude of possession still lingered, but they\nwere relatives for whom she felt little real affection.\n\n\"Mercy, child, how marvellous you look to-night!\" exclaimed Mrs.\nMaillard, holding her off and examining her high colour with obvious\nsuspicion. Mrs. Maillard was herself rather plump and red, and stern of\neye into the bargain. She was a keen, masterful woman.\n\n\"Thank you, ma'am,\" and Lucie made a mock courtesy. \"Do you like little\nColumbine?\"\n\n\"Very much. Here's Aunt Sally; take Miss Lucie's cloak, Sally.\"\n\nAn old coloured servant bobbed her head in greeting to Lucie, who\nremoved her cloak. As she did so, she saw that Mrs. Maillard's voice\ndied away, and that the lady's eyes were fastened in utter amazement\nupon her throat.\n\n\"Isn't it pretty, auntie?\" she asked, smilingly. This was straining the\nrelationship a trifle, but it was a custom which Lucie usually followed\nwith the family.\n\n\"My goodness gracious!\" The stern eyes hardened. \"Where--where on earth\ndid _you_ obtain such a thing? Why--why----\"\n\nColumbine's features flinched. She was a poor relation, of course, so\nthe look in the older woman's eyes and the implication of the words\nformed little less than an insult.\n\nQuietly she put one hand to her throat and removed the collar, dropping\nit into the hand of Mrs. Maillard. It was a thing to make any woman's\neyes widen--a collar of exquisitely wrought gold studded with ten great\nblazing star sapphires. Beside it the diamonds that bejewelled Mrs.\nMaillard's ample front looked cold and lifeless.\n\n\"That?\" queried Lucie, innocently, producing a scrap of chamois and\ndabbing at her nose. \"Oh, that's very interesting! It was made for Queen\nHortense--so was this scarf that keeps my ragged hair from lopping out!\"\n\n\"You didn't buy them, certainly!\" demanded Mrs. Maillard.\n\n\"Of course not. They were a present--only this morning.\"\n\n\"Girl!\" The lady's voice was harsh. \"A present? From whom, if you\nplease?\"\n\n\"Oh, I promised not to tell; he's a particular friend of mine. Aren't\nthe stones pretty?\"\n\nMrs. Maillard was speechless. She compressed her firm lips and watched\nLucie replace the sapphire collar without a word to offer. Silently she\nextended a corsage bouquet from the pile beside her; then, in a\ntrembling voice, forced herself to explain about the favour inside.\n\n\"And I hope,\" she added, \"that before receiving any more such valuable\npresents you'll consult _me_. Of course, if you don't wish to tell about\nthis, you needn't; but a word of advice will often save a girl from\nmaking very serious mistakes.\"\n\n\"Thank you, auntie dear,\" and Lucie nodded as she pinned the bouquet.\n\"You're just as dear to me as you can be! See you later.\"\n\nSlipping her mask into place she was gone, not without relief. She knew\nvery well that within half an hour Bob Maillard would be informed that\nshe had accepted gifts of jewels from other men, with all the\naccompanying implications and additions that imagination could furnish.\nFor, although Bob Maillard wanted very much indeed to marry her his\nmother had no intention of sanctioning such a union.\n\n\"Neither has Uncle Joseph,\" she reflected, smiling to herself, \"and\nneither have I! So we're all agreed, except Bob.\"\n\n\"Columbine!\" A hand fell upon her wrist. \"Columbine! Turn and confess\nthy sins!\"\n\nA cry of instinctive alarm broke from the girl; she turned, only to\nbreak into a laugh of chagrin at her own fright.\n\nShe had come to the foot of the wide, old-fashioned stairway that led to\nthe floors above, and beside her had suddenly appeared a Franciscan\nmonk, cowled and gowned in sober brown from head to foot.\n\n\"You frightened me, holy man!\" she cried, gaily. \"Confess to you,\nindeed! Not I.\"\n\n\"Never a better chance, butterfly of the world!\" It was a voice that she\ndimly recognized, yet she could not name the owner: a merry, carefree\nvoice that was slightly disguised.\n\n\"Never a better chance,\" and the Franciscan offered his arm. \"Haste not\nto the dance, fair sister--tarry a while and invite the soul in speech\nof import! Having passed the dragon at the gate, tarry a moment with\nthis man of vows----\"\n\n\"Shrive me quickly, then,\" she said, laughing.\n\n\"Now, without confession? Would you have me read your thoughts and give\npenance?\"\n\n\"If you can do that, holy man, I may confess; so prove it quickly!\"\n\nFor the moment they stood alone. Higher on the stairs, and among the\nrooms behind them, were gay groups of masquers--dominoes, imposing\nMephistos, backwoodsmen, gallants of Spain and France, red Indians and\nturbaned Hindus.\n\nThe Franciscan leaned forward. His voice came low, distinct, clear-cut,\nand he spoke in the French which Lucie understood as another\nmother-tongue, as do most of the older families of New Orleans.\n\n\"See how I read them, mademoiselle! One thought is of uneasy suspicion;\nit is typified by a hard-lipped, grasping man. One thought is of\nprofound regret; it is typified by a darkly welling stream of oil. One\nthought----\"\n\nSuddenly Lucie had shrunk away from him. \"Who--who are you?\" she\nbreathed, with a gasp that was almost of fear. \"Who are you, monsieur?\"\n\n\"A humble brother of minor orders,\" and he bowed. \"Shall I not continue\nwith my reading? The third thought, mademoiselle, is one of hope; it is\ntypified by a small man who is dressed all in gray----\"\n\nLucie turned away from him quickly.\n\n\"I think that you have made some grave error, monsieur,\" she said. Her\nvoice was cold, charged with dismissal and offended dignity. \"I pray\nyou, excuse me.\"\n\nNot waiting any response, she hastily ran up the stairs. After her, for\na moment, gazed the Franciscan, then shrugged his wide shoulders and\nplunged into the crowd.\n\nThe ballroom on the top floor was throbbing with music, gay with\ncostumes and decorations, thronged with dancing couples. Into the whirl\nof it pirouetted Columbine. Almost at once she found herself dancing\nwith a gorgeously attired Musketeer; she separated from him as quickly\nas possible, for she recognized him as Bob Maillard. Nor did he find her\nagain, although he searched, not knowing her identity; for she evaded\nhim.\n\nWhile she danced, while she chattered and laughed and entered into the\nmad gaiety of the evening, Lucie Ledanois could not banish from her mind\nthat ominous Franciscan. How could he have known? How could he have\nguessed what only she and one other barely suspected? There was no\nproof, of course; the very breath of suspicion seemed a calumny against\nan upright man!\n\nJoseph Maillard had sold that Terrebonne land six months before any gas\nor oil had been discovered there, and eight months before Lucie had come\ninto the management of her own affairs. He had not known about the\nminerals, of course; it was a case only of bad judgment. Yet,\nindubitably, he was now a shareholder and officer in the Bayou Oil\nCompany, the concern which had bought that strip of land.\n\nTwo years previously Maillard had sold that swamp land up in St. Landry\nparish; the land had been drained and sectioned off by real estate\npeople at enormous profit.\n\nLucie strove angrily to banish the dark thoughts from her mind. Why,\nMaillard was a rich man, a banker, an honorable gentleman! To doubt his\nhonour, although he was a harsh and a stern man, was impossible. Lucie\nknew him better than most, and could not believe----\n\n\"May I crave pardon for my error?\" came a voice at her elbow. She\nturned, to see the Franciscan again beside her. \"With a thousand\napologies for impertinence, mademoiselle; I am very sorry for my faults.\nWill not that admission obtain for me one little dance, one hint of\nforgiveness from fair Columbine?\"\n\nSomething in his voice spelt sincerity. Lucie, smiling, held out her\nhand.\n\n\"You are pardoned, holy man. If you can dance in that friar's robe, then\ntry it!\"\n\nCould he dance, indeed! Who could not dance with Columbine for partner?\nSo saying, the monk proved his word by the deed and proved it well. Nor\ndid he again hint that he had recognized her; until, as they parted, he\nonce more left her astonished and perturbed. As he bowed he murmured:\n\n\"Beware, sweet Columbine! Beware of the gay Aramis! Beware of his\nproposals!\"\n\nHe was gone upon the word.\n\nAramis? Why, that must be the Musketeer, of course--Bob Maillard! The\nname, with its implications, was a clever hit. But who was this brown\nmonk, who seemed to know so much, who danced so divinely, whose French\nwas like music? A vague suspicion was in the girl's mind, but she had no\nproof.\n\nHalf an hour after this Bob Maillard came to her, and with impatient\nwords made a path through the circle which surrounded her. He caught her\nhand and bent over it with an affectation of gallantry which became him\nwell, for in his costume he made a handsome figure.\n\n\"I know you now, Lucie!\" he murmured. \"I must see you at once--in the\nconservatory.\"\n\nShe was minded to refuse, but assented briefly. The words of the monk\nintrigued her; what had the man guessed? If Bob were indeed about to\npropose, she would this time cut off his hopes for good. But--was it\nthat sort of a proposal?\n\nAs she managed to rid herself of her admirers, and descended to the\nconservatory, she was highly vexed with herself and the Franciscan, and\nso came to her appointment in no equable frame of mind. She found\nMaillard waiting in the old-fashioned conservatory; he had unmasked, and\nwas puffing a cigarette. His heavy features and bold, shrewd eyes were\nfastened hungrily upon her as he came to meet her.\n\n\"By gad, Lucie, you're beautiful to-night!\"\n\n\"Thanks, cousin Robert. Was it for that----?\"\n\n\"No! See here, where did you get that collar of jewels?\"\n\n\"Indeed!\" The girl proudly drew herself up. \"What business is that of\nyours, sir?\"\n\n\"Aren't you one of the family? It's our business to protect your\nrep----\"\n\n\"Be careful!\" Anger trembled in her voice, cut off his words. \"Be\ncareful!\"\n\n\"But damn it--Lucie! Don't you know that I want to marry you----\"\n\n\"My dear Robert, I certainly do not want to marry any man who swears to\nmy face--you least of all!\" she coldly intervened. \"I have already\nrefused you three times; let this be the fourth and last. I owe you no\naccount of my possessions nor where I get them; I am entirely capable of\nmanaging my own affairs. Now, kindly inform me why you wished me to meet\nyou here. Also, you know that I don't like cigarette smoke.\"\n\nSulkily, Maillard threw away his cigarette; with an effort he calmed\nhimself. He was anything but a fool, this young man. He was rather\nclever, and saw that he had so long considered his pretty cousin a\npersonal possession that he was now in some danger of losing her.\n\n\"I have a chance to make some money for you in a hurry,\" he said. \"Your\nfather left you a good deal of land up Bayou Terrebonne way----\"\n\n\"Your father sold some of it,\" she put in, idly. His eyes flickered to\nthe thrust.\n\n\"Yes; but you've plenty left, near Paradis. It's away from the gas\nfield, but I'm interested in an oil company. We've plenty of money, and\nwe're going to go strong after the liquid gold. That land of yours is\ngood for nothing else, and if you want to make some money out of it I'll\nswing the company into leasing at a good figure and drilling there.\"\n\n\"You think there's oil on the land?\"\n\n\"No.\" He made a swift, energetic gesture of dissent. \"To be frank, I\ndon't. But I'd like to throw a bit of luck your way, Lucie. We're\ngetting a lot of money into the company, and some brains. That fellow\nGramont--the prince, you know him--he's an engineer and a geologist, and\nhe's in the swim.\"\n\n\"So,\" the girl smiled a little, \"you would betray your business friends\nin order to make a bit of money for me?\"\n\nMaillard stared at her. \"Well, if you put it that way, yes! I'd do more\nthan that for----\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" she interrupted, her voice cold. \"I don't think I'd trust\nyour sagacity very far, Robert. Good-night.\"\n\nShe turned from him and was gone, dancing through the great rooms like a\ntrue Columbine. Later he saw her among the dancers above, although he\nobtained no further speech with her.\n\nMidnight neared, and brought a concern to many; the Midnight Masquer had\ngained his name by invariably appearing a moment or two before the\nstroke of twelve. Jachin Fell, who divided his time between enjoying the\nsmoking room and wandering about among the masquers, perceived that\nJoseph Maillard was watching the time with anxiety.\n\nA large man, stern and a bit scornful of look, Maillard was imposing\nrather than handsome. He appeared the typical banker, efficient, devoid\nof all sentiment. Amused by the man's evident uneasiness, Jachin Fell\nkept him in view while the moments dragged. One might have thought that\nthe little gray man was studying the financier as an entomologist\nstudies a butterfly on a pin.\n\nShortly before twelve Columbine pirouetted up to Jachin Fell and\naccepted the arm he offered her. They were for the moment alone, in a\ncorner of the ballroom.\n\n\"I must see you to-morrow, please,\" she breathed.\n\n\"Gladly,\" he assented. \"May I call? It's Sunday, you know----\"\n\n\"If you will; at three. Something has happened, but I cannot speak of it\nhere. Does any one else know that you--that you are interested in my\naffairs?\"\n\nThe pale gray eyes of the little gray man looked very innocent and\nwondering.\n\n\"Certainly not, my dear! Why?\"\n\n\"I'll tell you to-morrow.\" Then she broke into a laugh. \"Well, it is\nmidnight--and the Masquer has not appeared! I'm almost sorry.\"\n\nThe lights flickered off for a moment, then on again. The signal for\nunmasking!\n\nThe dancing ceased. From the whole room arose a babel of voices--cries\nof surprise, exclamations, merry laughter. Columbine removed her mask.\nAn instant later Joseph Maillard approached them, chuckling to himself\nand looking hugely relieved.\n\n\"Ha, Lucie! I guessed you beneath the Columbine daintiness! Well,\nJachin, it was a hoax after all, eh? Some confounded joke. Come down to\nthe library in five minutes, will you? A meeting of the select circle,\nto discuss prohibition.\"\n\n\"Aren't you going to invite me, Uncle Joseph?\" broke in Lucie, gaily.\n\n\"No, no, little one!\" Maillard reproved her, laughingly. \"Look not upon\nthe silver cup at your age, my dear. Have you examined your favour yet?\"\n\nRemembering, the girl caught at her corsage. Cries of delight were\narising on all sides as the favours were revealed--most handsome\nfavours, even for Mardi Gras! From the heart of the rosebuds in her hand\nLucie removed a brooch of old filigree work set with a group of pearls.\nShe glanced about for Jachin Fell, but he had vanished with Maillard. A\nvoice rose at her elbow:\n\n\"Mademoiselle, you are not less lucky than beautiful! Pearls to the\npearl!\"\n\nShe turned to see the Franciscan--no longer masked, but now gazing at\nher from a frank, laughing countenance, still partially veiled by the\nbrown cowl that was drawn up close about his head.\n\n\"Henry Gramont!\" she exclaimed. \"Oh, I half suspected that it was\nyou----\"\n\n\"But you were not sure?\" he chuckled. \"You're not offended with me,\nLucie?\"\n\n\"I should be.\" She tossed her head. \"You were impertinent, M. le\nprince!\"\n\nHe made a distasteful gesture. \"None of that, Lucie! You know I don't\nlike it----\"\n\n\"Oh, la, la!\" she mocked him. \"M. le prince is seeing America, _n'est ce\npas_? He has come to America to find a rich wife, is it not?\"\n\nGramont's face lost its smile, and suddenly became almost harsh.\n\n\"I shall call upon you at four to-morrow, Lucie,\" he said, abruptly, and\nturned. Nor did he pause to get her reply. An instant afterward Lucie\nwas surrounded by a merry group of friends, and she saw no more of Henry\nGramont.\n\nAbout five minutes later those in the ballroom distinctly heard, through\nthe open windows, the heavy pulsations of an airplane motor.\n\n\n\n\n                              CHAPTER III\n\n                              _The Bandit_\n\n\nJoseph Maillard's library was on the ground floor of the house; it was a\nsedate and stately room, and was invariably shut off to itself. Not even\nto-night, of all nights, was it thrown open with the remainder of the\nhouse.\n\nHere, for a good half hour, had been Uncle Neb. The old butler was\nmysteriously engaged with certain tall silver goblets, fragrant mint,\nand yet more fragrant--if illegal--bottles. And it was here that Joseph\nMaillard summoned half a dozen of his particular cronies and friends,\nafter the stroke of midnight had assured him that there was no danger to\nbe expected from the bandit. His son was not among the number. The half\ndozen were nearly all elderly men, and, with the exception of Jachin\nFell, all were men of prominent affairs.\n\nAbout the table grouped Maillard and his guests, while in the background\nhovered Uncle Neb, glistening black, hugely important, and grinning\nwidely. Fell was the last to enter the room, and as he did so old Judge\nForester turned to him smilingly.\n\n\"Ah, here is an attorney in whom there is no guile! Jachin, come and\nsettle a dispute. I maintain that the dignity of the law is not less now\nthan in the old days; that it has merely accommodated itself to changing\nconditions, and that it is a profession for gentlemen now as always.\nJules, state your argument!\"\n\nJules Delagroux, a white-haired Creole lawyer of high standing, smiled a\ntrifle sadly.\n\n\"My case,\" he said, \"is that the old days are dead; that the law is no\nlonger a profession, but a following for charlatans. In a word, that the\nlaw has been killed by the lawyers.\" He gestured finality and glanced at\nFell.\n\n\"So?\" Jachin Fell smiled in his shy fashion. \"Gentlemen, I heartily\nagree with you both. I am an attorney, but I do not practise because I\ncannot accommodate myself to those very changing conditions of which\nJudge Forester speaks. To-day, the lawyer must be a politician; he must\nbe an adept in the trick of words and deeds; he must be able not to\nserve his profession but to make it serve him, and he must remember\nalways that the rights of property are more sacred than those of life\nand liberty. Otherwise, he will remain honest and poor.\"\n\nAn ejaculation of \"True\" from the judge brought smiles. Jachin Fell\ncontinued whimsically:\n\n\"Regarding these very conditions many years ago, gentlemen, I was\ntempted to change my profession--but to what? I was tempted to enter the\nchurch until I saw that the same conditions hold good of a clergyman. I\nwas tempted to enter medicine until I saw that they also held true of a\ndoctor. I was tempted to other things, always with the like result.\nWell, you know the story of Aunt Dixie and her black underwear--'Honey,\nI ain't ashamed of mah grief; when I mourns, I _mourns_!' Even so with\nthe law----\"\n\nA burst of laughter drowned him out, and the original argument was\nforgotten. Maillard, standing before a small wall safe that flanked the\nopen hearth, lifted his silver goblet, asteam with beads. The moment for\nwhich he had been waiting was here; he launched his little thunderbolt\nwith an air of satisfied importance.\n\n\"My friends, I have a confession to make!\" he announced. \"To-day I\nreceived a note from the Midnight Masquer stating that he would be with\nus this evening, presumably at the hour of midnight, his usual time.\"\n\nThese words brought an instant silence. Uncle Neb, from his corner,\nuttered a startled \"Fore de lawd!\" that rang through the room; yet no\none smiled. The half-dozen men were tense, watchful, astonished. But\nMaillard swung up his silver cup and laughed gaily.\n\n\"I took full precautions, gentlemen. The hour of danger is past, and the\nnotorious bandit has not arrived--or, if he has arrived, he is now in\nthe hands of the law. After all, that note may have been something in\nthe nature of a carnival jest! So up with your cups, my friends--a\nlifelong health to Mardi Gras, and damnation to prohibition and the\nMidnight Masquer!\"\n\nFrom everyone broke a swift assent to the toast, a murmur of relieved\ntension. The silver goblets were lifted, touched in a musical clinking\nof edges, and the aromatic breath of juleps filled the library as the\ndrinkers, in true Southern fashion, buried noses in the fragrant mint.\nThen, as the cups were lowered, from the recess of the curtained windows\nat one end of the room came a quiet voice:\n\n\"I thank you, gentlemen! But I must remind you, Maillard, that there was\nnot a time limit set in the note.\"\n\nWith a simultaneous gasp everyone turned. Maillard staggered; his face\nwent livid. Uncle Neb, who had been advancing to refill the cups,\ndropped his silver tray with a crash that went unheeded, indeed unheard.\nEvery eye was fastened upon that amazing figure now advancing from the\nshadows of the recess.\n\nIt was the figure of an aviator, clad in leather from top to toe, the\ngoggles and helmet shield completely masking his head and features from\nrecognition. In his hand he held an automatic pistol, which covered the\ngroup of men before him with its threatening mouth.\n\n\"Not a sound, if you please,\" he warned, his voice thin and\nnasal--obviously disguised. \"I trust that none of you gentlemen is\narmed, because I am very quick on the trigger. A very pleasant surprise,\nMaillard? You'd given me up, eh?\"\n\nFor an instant no one spoke. Then Maillard moved slightly, moved his\nhand toward a button set in the wall near the safe. The voice of the\nbandit leaped out at him like thin steel:\n\n\"Quiet, you fool! If you touch that button----\"\n\nMaillard stiffened, and gripped the table edge with his shaking hand.\n\n\"This is an outrage, suh!\" began Judge Forester, his white goatee\nbristling. The bandit bowed slightly, and addressed the gathering in a\ntone of dry raillery:\n\n\"An outrage? Exactly. You were just now discussing the majesty of the\nlaw. Well, I assure you that I found your discussion intensely\ninteresting. Mr. Fell correctly stated that the rights of property are\nmore sacred in legal eyes than the rights of human life. You see,\ngentlemen, the discussion touched me very closely!\n\n\"I am now engaged in outraging the law, and I have this amendment to\npropose to Mr. Fell: That if he had been tempted to follow the\nprofession of a robber he would have found the same conditions\nprevailing which he quoted as applying to other professions.\"\n\nJachin Fell, alone of those about the table, allowed a smile to curve\nhis lips.\n\n\"The rights of property,\" pursued the bandit with a deadly smoothness,\n\"are to me, also, far more sacred than human life; there I agree with\nthe law. So, gentlemen, kindly empty your pockets on the table.\" His\nvoice became crisp. \"The jewelled scarf-pins which you received as\nfavours this evening may be added to the collection; otherwise, I shall\nnot touch your private possessions. No watches, thank you. Maillard,\nkindly begin! I believe that you carry a wallet? If you please.\"\n\nThe banker could not but obey. His hands trembling with fear and rage,\nhe took from his pocket a wallet, and emptied a sheaf of bills upon the\ntable. One after another, the other men followed his example. The bandit\nmade no attempt to search them, but watched with eyes that glittered\nfrom behind his mask as they laid money and scarf-pins on the table.\nWhen it came his turn, Jachin Fell drew a single bill from his pocket,\nand laid it down.\n\n\"You put some faith in that warning, Mr. Fell?\" The bandit laughed. \"Do\nyou think that you will know me again?\"\n\n\"I hardly believe so, sir,\" answered Fell in his apologetic fashion.\n\"Your disguise is really excellent.\"\n\n\"Thank you.\" The bandit's voice held a thin mockery. \"Coming from you,\nsir, that compliment is most welcome.\"\n\n\"What the devil does the fellow mean?\" exploded Judge Forester.\n\n\"Then you are not aware that Mr. Fell is a man of large affairs?\" The\nbandit's white teeth flashed in a smile. \"He is a modest man, this\nattorney! And a dangerous man also, I assure you. But come, Mr. Fell,\nI'll not betray you.\"\n\nJachin Fell obviously did not appreciate the pleasantry. His shy and\nwondering features assumed a set and hardened look.\n\n\"Whoever you are,\" he responded, a subtle click of anger in his tone,\n\"you shall be punished for this!\"\n\n\"For what, Mr. Fell? For knowing too much of your private affairs?\" The\nbandit laughed. \"Fear not--I am only an amateur at this game,\nfortunately! So do your worst, and my blessing upon you! Now, gentlemen,\nkindly withdraw a few paces and join Uncle Neb yonder against the wall.\nAll but you, Maillard; I'm not through with you yet.\"\n\nThe automatic pistol gestured; under its menace everyone obeyed the\ncommand, for the calm assurance of the bandit made it seem extremely\nlikely that he would use the weapon without compunction. The men\nwithdrew toward the far end of the room, where a word from the aviator\nhalted them. Maillard remained standing where he was, his heavy features\nnow mottled with impotent anger.\n\nThe Masquer advanced to the table and gathered the heap of money and\nscarfpins into the leathern pocket of his coat. During the process his\ngaze did not waver from the group of men, nor did the threat of his\nweapon lift from the banker before him.\n\n\"Now, Maillard,\" he quietly ordered, \"you will have the kindness to turn\naround and open the wall safe behind you. And don't touch the button.\"\n\nMaillard started.\n\n\"That safe! Why--why--damn you, I'll do nothing of the sort!\"\n\n\"If you don't,\" was the cool threat, \"I'll shoot you through the\nabdomen. A man fears a bullet there worse than death. It may kill you,\nand it may not; really, I care very little. You--you financier!\"\n\nScorn leaped into the quiet voice, scorn that lashed and bit deep.\n\n\"You money trickster! Do you think I would spare such a man as you? You\ndraw your rents from the poor and destitute, your mortgages cover half\nthe parishes in the state, and in your heart is neither compassion nor\npity for man or woman. You take the property of others from behind the\nsafety curtain of the law; I do it from behind a pistol! I rob only\nthose who can afford to lose--am I really as bad as you, in the eyes of\nmorality and ethics? Bah! I could shoot you down without a qualm!\"\n\nIn his voice was so deadly a menace that Maillard trembled. Yet the\nbanker drew himself up and struggled for self-control, stung as he was\nby this flood of vituperation before the group of his closest friends.\n\n\"There is nothing of mine in that safe,\" he said, his voice a low growl.\n\"I have given it to my son to use. He is not here.\"\n\n\"That,\" said the Masquer, calmly, \"is exactly why I desire you to open\nit. Your son must make his contribution, for I keenly regret his\nabsence. If you are a criminal, he is worse! You rob and steal under\nshelter of the law, but you have certain limitations, certain bounds of\nan almost outgrown honour. He has none, that son of yours. Why, he would\nnot hesitate to turn your own tricks back upon you, to rob _you_, if he\ncould! Open that safe or take the consequences; no more talk, now!\"\n\nThe command cracked out like a whiplash. With a shrug of helplessness\nthe banker turned and fumbled with the protruding knob of the safe. With\none exception all eyes were fastened upon this amazing Masquer. The\nexception was Jachin Fell, who, suddenly alert and watchful, had turned\nhis attention to Maillard and the safe, a keen speculation in his gaze\nas though he were wondering what that steel vault would produce.\n\nAll were silent. There was something about this Midnight Masquer that\nheld them intently. Perhaps some were inclined to think him a jester,\none of the party masquerading under the famous bandit's guise; if so,\nhis last words to Maillard had removed all such thought. That indictment\nhad been deadly and terrible--and true, as they knew. Bob Maillard was\nnot greatly admired by those among his father's friends who best knew\nhim.\n\nNow the door of the safe swung open. The compartments appeared empty.\n\n\"Take out the drawers and turn them up over the table,\" commanded the\nMasquer.\n\nMaillard obeyed. He took several of the small drawers, and all proved to\nbe empty; this development drew a dry chuckle from Jachin Fell. Then,\nfrom the last drawer, there fell out on the table a large envelope,\nsealed. The Masquer leaned forward, seized upon this envelope, and\ncrushed it into his pocket.\n\n\"Thank you,\" he observed. \"That is all.\"\n\n\"Damn you!\" cried Maillard, shaking a fist. \"You'd try blackmail, would\nyou?\"\n\nThe bandit regarded him a moment, then laughed.\n\n\"If you knew what was in that envelope, my dear financier, you might not\nspeak so hastily. If I knew what was in it, I might answer you. But I\ndon't know. I only suspect--and hope.\"\n\nWhile he spoke the bandit was backing toward the door that opened upon\nthe lower hallway of the house. He drew this door open, glanced swiftly\nout into the hall, and then placed the key on the outside.\n\n\"And now, my friends--_au revoir_!\"\n\nThe Masquer sprang backward into the hall. The door slammed, the key\nclicked. He was gone!\n\nMaillard was the first to wake into voice and action. \"The other door!\"\nhe cried. \"Into the dining room----\"\n\nHe flung open a second door and dashed into the dining room, followed by\nthe other men. Here the windows, giving upon the garden, were open. Then\nMaillard came to a sudden halt, and after him the others; through the\nnight was pulsating, with great distinctness, the throbbing roar of an\nairplane motor! From Maillard broke a bitter cry:\n\n\"The detectives--I'll get the fools here! You gentlemen search the\nhouse; Uncle Neb, go with them, into every room! That fellow can't\npossibly have escaped----\"\n\n\"No word of alarm to the ladies,\" exclaimed Judge Forester, hurriedly.\n\"If he was not upstairs, then they have seen nothing of him. We must\ndivide and search.\"\n\nThey hastily separated. Maillard dashed away to summon the detectives,\nalso to get other men to aid in the search.\n\nThe result was vain. Within twenty minutes the entire house, from cellar\nto garret, had been thoroughly gone over, without causing any alarm to\nthe dancers in the ballroom. Maillard began to think himself a little\nmad. No one had been seen to enter or leave the house, and certainly\nthere had been no airplane about. The Masquer had not appeared except in\nthe library, and now he was most indubitably not in the house. By all\ntestimony, he had neither entered it nor left it!\n\n\"Well, I'm damned!\" said Maillard, helplessly, to Judge Forester, when\nthe search was concluded. \"Not a trace of the scoundrel! Here,\nFell--can't you help us out? Haven't you discovered a thing?\"\n\n\"Nothing,\" responded Jachin Fell, calmly.\n\nAt this instant Bob Maillard rushed up. He had just learned of the\nMasquer's visit. In response to his excited questioning his father\ndescribed the scene in the library and added:\n\n\"I trust there was nothing important among those papers of yours,\nRobert?\"\n\n\"No,\" said the younger man. \"No. Nothing valuable at all.\"\n\nHenry Gramont was passing. He caught the words and paused, his gaze\nresting for an instant upon the group. A faint smile rested upon his\nrather harshly drawn features.\n\n\"I just found this,\" he announced, holding out a paper. \"It was pinned\nto the outside of the library door. I presume that your late visitor\nleft it as a memento?\"\n\nJachin Fell took the paper, the other men crowding around him.\n\n\"Ah, Maillard! The same handwriting as that of your letter!\"\n\nUpon the paper was pencilled a single hasty line:\n\n           My compliments to Robert Maillard--and my thanks.\n\nBob Maillard sprang forward, angrily inspecting the paper. When he\nrelinquished it, Fell calmly claimed it again.\n\n\"Confound the rogue!\" muttered the banker's son, turning away. His\nfeatures were pale, perhaps with anger. \"There was nothing but stock\ncertificates in that envelope--and they can be reissued.\"\n\nThe festivities were not broken up. As much could hardly be said for the\nhost, who felt keenly the verbal lashing that had been administered to\nhim before his friends. News of the robbery gradually leaked out among\nthe guests; the generally accepted verdict was that the Masquer had\nappeared, only to be frightened away before he could secure any loot.\n\nIt was nearly two in the morning when Jachin Fell, who was leaving,\nencountered Henry Gramont at the head of the wide stairway. He halted\nand turned to the younger man.\n\n\"Ah--have you a pencil, if you please?\"\n\n\"I think so, Mr. Fell.\" Gramont felt beneath his Franciscan's robe, and\nextended a pencil.\n\nJachin Fell examined it, brought a paper from beneath his domino, and\nwrote down a word. The paper was that on which the farewell message of\nthe Midnight Masquer had been written.\n\n\"A hard lead, a very hard point indeed!\" said Fell. He pocketed the\npaper again and regarded Gramont steadily as he returned the pencil.\n\"Few men carry so hard a pencil, sir.\"\n\n\"You're quite right,\" and Gramont smiled. \"I borrowed this from Bob\nMaillard only a moment ago. Its hardness surprised me.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said Jachin Fell, mildly. \"By the way, aren't you the Prince de\nGramont? When we met this evening, you were introduced as plain Mr.\nGramont, but it seems to me that I had heard something----\"\n\n\"Quite a mistake, Mr. Fell. I'm no prince; simply Henry Gramont, and\nnothing more. Also, an American citizen. Some of these New Orleans\npeople can't forget the prince business, most unfortunately.\"\n\n\"Ah, yes,\" agreed Fell, shyly. \"Do you know, a most curious thing----\"\n\n\"Yes?\" prompted Gramont, his eyes intent upon the little gray man.\n\n\"That paper you brought us--the paper which you found pinned to the\nlibrary door,\" said Fell, apologetically. \"Do you know, Mr. Gramont,\nthat oddly enough there were no pin holes in that paper?\"\n\nGramont smiled faintly, as though he were inwardly amused over the\nremark.\n\n\"Not at all curious,\" he said, his voice level. \"It was pinned rather\nstoutly--I tore off the portion bearing the message. I'll wager that\nyou'll find the end of the paper still on the door downstairs. You might\nmake certain that its torn edge fits that of the paper in your pocket;\nif it did not, then the fact _would_ be curious! I am most happy to have\nmet you, Mr. Fell. I trust that we shall meet again, often.\"\n\nWith a smile, he extended his hand, which Mr. Fell shook cordially.\n\nAs Jachin Fell descended the wide staircase his face was red--quite red.\nOne would have said that he had just been worsted in some encounter, and\nthat the sense of defeat still rankled within him.\n\nUpon gaining the lower hall he glanced at the door of the library.\nThere, still pinned to the wood where it had been unregarded by the\npassersby, was a small scrap of paper. Mr. Fell glanced at it again,\nthen shook his head and slowly turned away, as though resisting a\ntemptation.\n\n\"No,\" he muttered. \"No. It would be sure to fit the paper in my pocket.\nIt would be sure to fit, confound him!\"\n\nA little later he left the house and walked along the line of cars that\nwere waiting parked in the drive and in the street outside. Before one\nof the cars he came to a halt, examining it closely. The sleepy\nchauffeur got out and touched his cap in a military salute; he was a\nsturdy young fellow, his face very square and blunt.\n\n\"A very handsome car. May I ask whose it is?\" inquired Fell, mildly.\n\n\"Mr. Gramont's, sir,\" answered the chauffeur.\n\n\"Ah, thank you. A very handsome car indeed. Good-night!\"\n\nMr. Fell walked away, striding briskly down the avenue. When he\napproached the first street light he came to a pause, and began softly\nto pat his person as though searching for something.\n\n\"I told you that you'd pay for knowing too much about me, young man!\" he\nsaid, softly. \"What's this, now--what's this?\"\n\nA slight rustle of paper, as he walked along, had attracted his\nattention. He passed his hands over the loose, open domino that cloaked\nhim; he detected a scrap of paper pinned to it in the rear. He loosened\nthe paper, and under the street light managed to decipher the writing\nwhich it bore.\n\nA faint smile crept to his lips as he read the pencilled words:\n\n        I do not love you, Jachin Fell,\n        The reason why I cannot tell;\n        But this I know, and know full well,\n        I do not love you, Jachin Fell!\n\n\"Certainly the fellow has wit, if not originality,\" muttered Mr. Fell,\nas he carefully stowed away the paper. The writing upon it was in the\nhand of the Midnight Masquer.\n\n\n\n\n                               CHAPTER IV\n\n                               _Callers_\n\n\nThe house in which Lucie Ledanois lived had been her mother's; the\nfurniture and other things in it had been her mother's; the two negro\nservants, who spoke only the Creole French patois, had been her\nmother's. It was a small house, but very beautiful inside. The exterior\nbetrayed a lack of paint or the money with which to have painting done.\n\nThe Ledanois family, although distantly connected with others such as\nthe Maillards, had sent forth its final bud of fruition in the girl\nLucie. Her mother had died while she was yet an infant, and through the\nyears she had companioned her father, an invalid during the latter days.\nHe had never been a man to count dollars or costs, and to a large extent\nhe had outworn himself and the family fortunes in a vain search for\nhealth.\n\nWith Lucie he had been in Europe at the outbreak of war, and had come\nhome to America only to die shortly afterward. Once deprived of his fine\nrecklessness, the girl had found her affairs in a bad tangle. Under the\nguardianship of Maillard the tangle had been somewhat resolved and\nsimplified, but even Maillard would appear to have made mistakes, and of\nlate Lucie had against her will suspected something amiss in the matter\nof these mistakes.\n\nIt was natural, then, that she should take Jachin Fell into her\nconfidence. Maillard had been her guardian, but it was to Fell that she\nhad always come with her girlish cares and troubles, during even the\nlifetime of her father. She had known Fell all her life; she had met him\nin strange places, both at home and abroad. She entertained a\nwell-grounded suspicion that Jachin Fell had loved her mother, and this\none fact lay between them, never mentioned but always there, like a bond\nof faith and kindliness.\n\nAt precisely three o'clock of the Sunday afternoon Jachin Fell rang the\ndoorbell and Lucie herself admitted him. She ushered him into the\nparlour that was restful with its quiet brasses and old rosewood.\n\n\"Tell me quickly, Uncle Jachin!\" eagerly exclaimed the girl. \"Did you\nactually see the Midnight Masquer last night? I didn't know until\nafterward that he had really been downstairs and had robbed----\"\n\n\"I saw him, my dear,\" and the little gray man smiled. There was more\nwarmth to his smile than usual just now. Perhaps it was a reflection\nfrom the eager vitality which so shone in the eyes of Lucie. \"I saw him,\nyes.\"\n\nA restful face was hers--not beautiful at first glance; a little too\nstrong for beauty one would say. The deep gray eyes were level and quiet\nand wide apart, and on most occasions were quite inscrutable. They were\nnow filled with a quick eagerness as they rested upon Jachin Fell. Lucie\ncalled him uncle, but not as she called Joseph Maillard uncle; here was\nno relationship, no formal affectation of relationship, but a purely\nabiding trust and friendship.\n\nJachin Fell had done more for Lucie than she herself knew or would know;\nwithout her knowledge he had quietly taken care of her finances to an\nappreciable extent. Between them lay an affection that was very real.\nLucie, better than most, knew the extraordinary capabilities of this\nlittle gray man; yet not even Lucie guessed a tenth of the character\nthat lay beneath his surface. To her he was never reserved or secretive.\nNonetheless, she touched sometimes an impenetrable wall that seemed ever\npresent within him.\n\n\"You saw him?\" repeated the girl, quickly. \"What was he like? Do you\nknow who he is?\"\n\n\"Certainly I know,\" replied Fell, still smiling at her.\n\n\"Oh! Then who is he?\"\n\n\"Softly, softly, young lady! I know him, but even to you I dare not\nbreathe his name until I obtain some direct evidence. Let us call him\nMr. X., after the approved methods of romance, and I shall expound what\nI know.\"\n\nHe groped in his vest pocket. Lucie sprang up, bringing a smoking stand\nfrom the corner of the room to his chair. She held a match to his El\nRey, and then curled up on a Napoleon bed and watched him intently while\nhe spoke.\n\n\"The bandit did not enter the house during the evening, nor did he\nleave, nor was he found in the house afterward,\" he said, tonelessly.\n\"So, incredible as it may appear, he was one of the guests. This Mr. X.\ncame to the dance wearing the aviator's costume, or most of it,\nunderneath his masquerade costume. When he was ready to act, he doffed\nhis outer costume, appeared as the Midnight Masquer, effected his\npurpose, then calmly donned his outer costume again and resumed his\nplace among the guests. You understand?\n\n\"Well, then! Maillard yesterday received a note from the Masquer,\nbrazenly stating that he intended to call during the evening. I have\nthat note. It was written with an extremely hard lead pencil, such as\nfew men carry, because it does not easily make very legible writing.\nLast night I asked Mr. X. for a pencil, and he produced one with an\nextra hard lead--mentioning that he had borrowed it from Bob Maillard,\nas indeed he had.\"\n\n\"What! Surely, you don't mean----\"\n\n\"Of course I don't. Mr. X. is very clever, that's all. Here is what took\nplace last night. Mr. X. brought us another note from the Masquer,\nsaying that he had found it pinned to the library door. As a matter of\nfact, he had written it on a leaf torn from his notebook. I took the\nnote from him, observing at the time that the paper had no pin holes.\nProbably, Mr. X. saw that there was something amiss; he presently went\nback downstairs, took the remainder of the torn leaf from his notebook,\nand pinned it to the door. A little later, I met him and mentioned the\nlack of pin holes; he calmly referred me to the piece on the door,\nsaying that he had merely torn off the note without removing the pins.\nYou follow me?\"\n\n\"Of course,\" murmured the girl, her eyes wide in fascinated interest.\n\"And he knew that you guessed him to be the Masquer?\"\n\n\"He suspected me, I think,\" said Fell, mildly. \"It is understood that\nyou will not go about tracing these little clues? I do not wish to\ndisclose his identity, even to your very discreet brain----\"\n\n\"Don't be silly, Uncle Jachin!\" she broke in. \"You know I'll do nothing\nof the sort. Go on, please! Did you find the airplane?\"\n\n\"Yes.\" Jachin Fell smiled drily. \"I was thinking of that as I left the\nhouse and came to the line of waiting automobiles. A word with one of\nthe outside detectives showed me that one of the cars in the street had\nbeen testing its engine about midnight. I found that the car belonged to\nMr. X.\n\n\"How simple, Lucie, and how very clever! The chauffeur worked a powerful\nmotor with a muffler cutout at about the time Mr. X., inside the house,\nwas making his appearance. It scarcely sounded like an airplane motor,\nyet frightened and startled, people would imagine that it did. Thus\narose the legend that the Midnight Masquer came and departed by means of\nairplane--a theory aided ingeniously by his costume. Well, that is all I\nknow or suspect, my dear Lucie! And now----\"\n\n\"Now, I suppose,\" said the girl, thoughtfully, \"you'll put that awful\nCreole of yours on the track of Mr. X.? Ben Chacherre is a good\nchauffeur, and he's amusing enough--but he's a bloodhound! I don't\nwonder that he used to be a criminal. Even if you have rescued him from\na life of crime, you haven't improved his looks.\"\n\n\"Exactly--Ben is at work,\" assented Jachin Fell. \"The gentleman under\nsuspicion is very prominent. To accuse him without proof would be utter\nfolly. To catch him _in flagrante delicto_ will be difficult. So, I am\nin no haste. He will not disappear, believe me, and something may turn\nup at any moment to undo him. Besides, I can as yet discover no motive\nfor his crimes, since he is quite well off financially.\"\n\n\"Gambling,\" suggested the girl.\n\n\"I cannot find that he has lost any considerable sums. Well, no matter!\nNow that I have fully unbosomed myself, my dear, it is your turn.\"\n\n\"All right, Uncle Jachin.\" Lucie took a large morocco case from the\nchair beside her, and extended it. \"You lent me these things to wear\nlast night, and I----\"\n\n\"No, no,\" intervened Fell. \"I gave them to you, my dear--in fact, I\nbought them for you two years ago, and kept them until now! You have\nworn them; they are yours, and you become them better than even did poor\nQueen Hortense! So say no more. I trust that Mrs. Maillard was righteous\nand envious?\"\n\n\"She was disagreeable,\" said Lucie. She leaned forward and imprinted a\nkiss upon the cheek of the little gray man. \"There! that is all the\nthanks I can give you, dear uncle; the gift makes me very happy, and\nI'll not pretend otherwise. Only, I feel as though I had no right to\nwear them--they're so wonderful!\"\n\n\"Nonsense! You can do anything you want to, as Eliza said when she\ncrossed the ice. But all this isn't why you summoned me here, you bundle\nof mystery! What bothered you last night, or rather, who?\"\n\nLucie laughed. \"There was a Franciscan who tried to be very mysterious,\nand to read my mind. He talked about oil, about a grasping, hard man,\nand mentioned you as my friend. Then he warned me against a proposal\nthat Bob might make; and sure enough, Bob did propose to buy what land\nis left to me on Bayou Terrebonne, saying he'd persuade his oil company\nthat there was oil on it, and that they'd buy or lease it. I told him\nno. The Franciscan, afterward, proved to be Henry Gramont; I wondered if\nyou had mentioned----\"\n\n\"Heaven forbid!\" exclaimed Mr. Fell, piously. \"I never even met Gramont\nuntil last night! Do you like him?\"\n\n\"Very much.\" The girl's eyes met his frankly. \"Do you?\"\n\n\"Very much,\" said Jachin Fell.\n\nLucie's gray eyes narrowed, searched his face. \"I'm almost able to tell\nwhen you're lying,\" she observed, calmly. \"You said that a trifle too\nhastily, Uncle Jachin. Why don't you like him?\"\n\nFell laughed, amused. \"Perhaps I have a prejudice against foreign\nnobles, Lucie. Our own aristocracy is bad enough, but----\"\n\n\"He's discarded all that. He was never French except in name.\"\n\n\"You speak as though you'd known him for some time. Have you had secrets\nfrom me?\"\n\n\"I have!\" laughter dimpled in the girl's face. \"For years and years!\nWhen I was in New York with father, before the war, we met him; he was\nvisiting in Newport with college friends. Then, you know that father and\nI were in France when the war broke out--father was ill and almost\nhelpless at the time, you remember. Gramont came to Paris to serve with\nhis regiment, and met us there. He helped us get away, procured real\nmoney for us, got us passage to New York. He knows lots of our friends,\nand I've always been deeply grateful to him for his assistance then.\n\n\"We've corresponded quite frequently during the war,\" she pursued. \"I\nmentioned him several times after we got home from France, but you\nprobably failed to notice the name. It's only since he came to New\nOrleans that I really kept any secrets from you; this time, I wanted to\nfind out if you liked him.\"\n\nJachin Fell nodded slowly. His face was quite innocent of expression.\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" he said. \"Yes--of course. He's a geologist or engineer, I\nthink?\"\n\n\"Both, and a good one. He's a stockholder in Bob Maillard's oil company,\nand I think he's come here to stay. Well, about last night--he probably\nguessed at some of my private affairs; I've written or spoken rather\nfrankly, perhaps. Also, Bob may have blabbed to him. Bob still\ndrinks--prohibition has not hit _him_ very hard!\"\n\n\"No,\" agreed Fell, gravely. \"Unfortunately, no. Lucie, I've discovered a\nmost important fact. Joseph Maillard did not own any stock in the Bayou\nOil Company at the time your land was sold them by him, and he had no\ninterest at all in the real estate concern that bought your St. Landry\nswamplands and made a fortune off them. We have really blamed him most\nunjustly.\"\n\nFor a moment there was silence between them.\n\n\"We need not mince matters,\" pursued Fell, slowly. \"Maillard has no\nscruples and no compassion; all the same, I am forced to the belief that\nhe has maintained your interest uprightly, and that his mistakes were\nonly errors. I do not believe that he has profited in the least from\nyou. Two small fortunes were swept out of your grip when he sold those\nlands; yet they had been worthless, and he had good offers for them. His\ninvestments in the companies concerned were made afterward, and I am\ncertain he sold the lands innocently.\"\n\nLucie drew a deep breath.\n\n\"I am glad you have said this,\" she returned, simply. \"It's been hard\nfor me to think that Uncle Joseph had taken advantage of me; I simply\ncouldn't make myself believe it. I think that he honestly likes me, as\nfar as he permits himself to like any one.\"\n\n\"He'd not loan you money on it,\" said Fell. \"Friendship isn't a tangible\nsecurity with him. And a girl is never secure, as Eliza said when she\ncrossed the ice.\"\n\n\"Well, who really did profit by my loss? Any one?\"\n\nFell's pale gray eyes twinkled, then cleared in their usually wide\ninnocence.\n\n\"My dear Lucie, is there one person in this world to whose faults Joseph\nMaillard is deliberately blind--one person to whose influence he is ever\nopen--one person to whom he would refuse nothing, in whom he would\npardon everything, of whom he would never believe any evil report?\"\n\n\"You mean----\" Lucie drew a quick breath, \"Bob?\"\n\n\"Yes, I mean Bob. That he has profited by your loss I am not yet in a\nposition to say; but I suspect it. He has his father's cupidity without\nhis father's sense of honour to restrain him. When I have finished with\nthe Masquer, I shall take up his trail.\"\n\nJachin Fell rose. \"Now I must be off, my dear. By the way, if I have\nneed of you in running down the Masquer, may I call upon your services?\"\n\n\"Certainly! I'd love to help, Uncle Jachin! We'd be real detectives?\"\n\n\"Almost.\" Jachin Fell smiled slightly. \"Will you dine with us to-morrow\nevening, Lucie? My mother commanded me to bring you as soon as\npossible----\"\n\n\"Oh, your mother!\" exclaimed the girl, contritely. \"I was so absorbed in\nthe Masquer that I forgot to ask after her. How is she?\"\n\n\"Quite as usual, thank you. I presume that you'll attend Comus with the\nMaillards?\"\n\n\"Yes. I'll come to-morrow night gladly, Uncle Jachin.\"\n\n\"And we'll take a look at the Proteus ball afterward, if you like. I'll\nsend Ben Chacherre for you with the car, if you're not afraid of him.\"\n\nLucie looked gravely into the smiling eyes of Fell.\n\n\"I'm not exactly afraid of him,\" she responded, soberly, \"but there is\nsomething about him that I can't like. I'm sorry that you're trying to\nregenerate him, in a way.\"\n\nFell shrugged lightly. \"All life is an effort, little one! Well,\ngood-bye.\"\n\nJachin Fell left the house at three-forty. Twenty minutes later the bell\nrang again. Lucie sent one of the servants to admit Henry Gramont; she\nkept him waiting a full fifteen minutes before she appeared, and then\nshe made no apologies whatever for the delay.\n\nNot that Gramont minded waiting; he deemed it a privilege to linger in\nthis house! He loved to study the place, so reflective of its owner. He\nloved the white Colonial mantel that surrounded the fireplace,\nperpetually alight, with its gleaming sheen of old brasses, and the\nglittering fire-set to one side. The very air of the place, the\natmosphere that it breathed, was sweet to him.\n\nThe Napoleon bed that filled the bow window, with its pillows and soft\ncoverings; the inlaid walnut cabinet made by Sheraton, with its quaintly\ncurved glasses that reflected the old-time curios within; the tilt\ntables, the rosewood chairs, the rugs, bought before the oriental rug\nmarket was flooded with machine-made Senna knots--about everything here\nhad an air of comfort, of long use, of restfulness. It was not the sort\nof place built up, raw item by raw item, by the colour-frenzied hands of\ndecorators. It was the sort of place that decorators strive desperately\nto imitate, and cannot.\n\nWhen Lucie made her appearance, Gramont bent over her hand and addressed\nher in French.\n\n\"You are charming as ever, Shining One! And in years to come you will be\nstill more charming. That is the beauty of having a name taken direct\nfrom the classics and bestowed as a good fairy's gift----\"\n\n\"Thank you, monsieur--but you have translated my name at least twenty\ntimes, and I am weary of hearing it,\" responded Lucie, laughingly.\n\n\"Poor taste, mademoiselle, to grow weary of such beauty!\"\n\n\"Not of the name, but of your exegesis upon it. Why should I not be\ndispleased? Last night you were positively rude, and now you decry my\ntaste! Did you leave all your manners in France, M. le prince?\"\n\n\"Some of them, yes--and all that prince stuff with them.\" Smiling as he\ndropped into English, Gramont glanced about the room, and his eyes\nsoftened.\n\n\"This is a lovey and loveable home of yours, Lucie!\" he exclaimed,\ngravely. \"So few homes are worthy the name; so few have in them the\nintimate air of use and friendliness--why are so many furnished from\nbargain sales? This place is touched with repose and sweetness; to come\nand sit here is a privilege. It is like being in another world, after\nall the money striving and the dollar madness of the city.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" The girl's gaze searched him curiously. \"I hope you're not going\nto take the fine artistic pose that it is a crime to make money?\"\n\nGramont laughed.\n\n\"Not much! I want to make money myself; that's one reason I'm in New\nOrleans. Still, you cannot deny that there is a craze about the eternal\nclutching after dollars. I can't make the dollar sign the big thing in\nlife, Lucie. You couldn't, either.\"\n\nShe frowned a little.\n\n\"You seem to have the European notion that all Americans are dollar\nchasers!\"\n\nHe shrugged his shoulders slightly. His harshly lined face was very\nstrong; one sensed that its harshness had come from the outside--from\nhunger, from hardship and privations, from suffering strongly borne. He\nhad not gone through the war unscathed, this young man who had tossed\naway a princely \"de\" in order to become plain Henry Gramont, American\ncitizen.\n\n\"In a sense, yes; why not?\" he answered. \"I am an American. I am a\ndollar chaser, and not ashamed of it. I am going into business here.\nOnce it is a success, I shall go on; I shall see America, I shall come\nto know this whole country of mine, all of it! I have been a month in\nNew Orleans--do you know, a strange thing happened to me only a few days\nafter I arrived here!\"\n\nWith her eyes she urged him on, and he continued gravely:\n\n\"In France I met a man, an American sergeant named Hammond. It was just\nat the close of things. We had adjoining cots at Nice----\"\n\n\"Ah!\" she exclaimed, quickly. \"I remember, you wrote about him--the man\nwho had been wounded in both legs! Did he get well? You never said.\"\n\n\"I never knew until I came here,\" answered Gramont. \"One night, not long\nafter I had got established in my pension on Burgundy Street, a man\ntried to rob me. It was this same man, Hammond; we recognized each other\nalmost at once.\n\n\"I took him home with me and learned his story. He had come back to\nAmerica only to find his wife dead from influenza, his home broken up,\nhis future destroyed. He drifted to New Orleans, careless of what\nhappened to him. He flung himself desperately into a career of burglary\nand pillage. Well, I gave Hammond a job; he is my chauffeur. You would\nnever recognize him as the same man now! I am very proud of his\nfriendship.\"\n\n\"That was well said.\" Lucie nodded her head quickly. \"I shan't call you\nM. Le prince any more--unless you offend again.\"\n\nHe smiled, reading her thought. \"I try not to be a snob, eh? Well, what\nI'm driving at is this: I want to know this country of mine, to see it\nwith clear, unprejudiced eyes. We hide our real shames and exalt our\nfalse ones. Why should we be ashamed of chasing the dollar? So long as\nthat is a means to the end of happiness, it's all right. But there are\nsome men who see it as an end alone, who can set no _finis_ to their\nwork except the dollar dropping into their pouch. Such a man is your\nrelative, Joseph Maillard--I say it without offence.\"\n\nLucie nodded, realizing that he was driving at some deeper thing, and\nheld her peace.\n\n\"You realize the fact, eh?\" Gramont smiled faintly. \"I do not wish to\noffend you, and I shall therefore refrain from saying all that is in my\nmind. But you have not hesitated to intimate very frankly that you are\nnot wealthy. Some time ago, if you recall, you wrote me how you had just\nmissed wealth through having sold some land. I have taken the liberty of\nlooking up that deal to some extent, and I have suspected that your\nuncle had some interest in putting the sale through----\"\n\nThe gray eyes of the girl flashed suddenly.\n\n\"Henry Gramont! Are my family affairs to be an open book to the world?\"\nA slight flush, perhaps of anger, perhaps of some other emotion, rose in\nthe girl's cheeks. \"Do you realize that you are intruding most\nunwarrantably into my private matters?\"\n\n\"Unwarrantably?\" Gramont's eyes held her gaze steadily. \"Do you really\nmean to use that word?\"\n\n\"I do, most certainly!\" answered Lucie with spirit. \"I don't think you\nrealize just what the whole thing tends toward----\"\n\n\"Oh, yes I do! Quite clearly.\" Gramont's cool, level tone conquered her\nindignation. \"I see that you are orphaned, and that your uncle was your\nguardian, and executed questionable deals which lost money for you.\nCome, that's brutally frank--but it's true! We are friends of long\nstanding; not intimate friends, perhaps, and yet I think very good\nfriends. I am most certainly not ashamed to say that when I had the\noccasion to look out for your interests I was very glad of the chance.\"\n\nGramont paused, but she did not speak. He continued after a moment:\n\n\"You had intimated to me, perhaps without meaning to do so, something of\nthe situation. I came here to New Orleans and became involved in some\ndealings with your cousin, Bob Maillard. I believed, and I believe now,\nthat in your heart you have some suspicion of your uncle in regard to\nthose transactions in land. Therefore, I took the trouble to look into\nthe thing to a slight extent. Shall I tell you what I have discovered?\"\n\nLucie Ledanois gazed at him, her lips compressed. She liked this new\nmanner of his, this firm and resolute gravity, this harshness. It\nbrought out his underlying character very well.\n\n\"If you please, Henry,\" she murmured very meekly. \"Since you have thrust\nyourself into my private affairs, I think I should at least get whatever\nbenefit I can!\"\n\n\"Exactly. Why not?\" He made a grave gesture of assent. \"Well, then, I\nhave discovered that your uncle appears to be honestly at fault in the\nmatter----\"\n\n\"Thanks for this approval of my family,\" she murmured.\n\n\"And,\" continued Gramont, imperturbably, \"that your suspicions of him\nwere groundless. But, on the other hand, something new has turned up\nabout which I wish to speak--but about which I must speak delicately.\"\n\n\"Be frank, my dear Henry--even brutal! Speak, by all means.\"\n\n\"Very well. Has Bob Maillard offered to buy your remaining land on the\nBayou Terrebonne?\"\n\nShe started slightly. So it was to this that he had been leading up all\nthe while!\n\n\"He broached the subject last night,\" she answered. \"I dismissed it for\nthe time.\"\n\n\"Good!\" he exclaimed with boyish vigour. \"Good! I warned you in time,\nthen! If you will permit me, I must advise you not to part with that\nland--not even for a good offer. This week, immediately Mardi Gras is\nover, I am going to inspect that land for the company; it is Bob\nMaillard's company, you know.\n\n\"If there's any chance of finding oil there, I shall first see you, then\nadvise the company. You can hold out for your fair share of the mineral\nrights, instead of selling the whole thing. You'll get it! Landowners\naround here are not yet wise to the oil game, but they'll soon learn.\"\n\n\"You would betray your business associates to help me?\" she asked,\ncurious to hear his reply. A slow flush crept into his cheeks.\n\n\"Certainly not! But I would not betray you to help my business friends.\nIs my unwarrantable intrusion forgiven?\"\n\nShe nodded brightly. \"You are put on probation, sir. You're in Bob's\ncompany?\"\n\n\"Yes.\" Gramont frowned. \"I invested perhaps too hastily--but no matter\nnow. I have the car outside, Lucie; may I have the pleasure of taking\nyou driving?\"\n\n\"Did you bring that chauffeur?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" and he laughed at her eagerness.\n\n\"Good! I accept--because I must see that famous\nsoldier-bandit-chauffeur. If you'll wait, I'll be ready in a minute.\"\n\nShe hurried from the room, a snatch of song on her lips. Gramont smiled\nas he waited.\n\n\n\n\n                               CHAPTER V\n\n                         _The Masquer Unmasks_\n\n\nIn New Orleans one may find pensions in the old quarter--the quarter\nwhich is still instinct with the pulse of old-world life. These pensions\ndo not advertise. The average tourist knows nothing of them. Even if he\nknew, indeed, he might have some difficulty in obtaining accommodations,\nfor it is not nearly enough to have the money; one must also have the\nintroductions, come well recommended, and be under the tongue of good\nrepute.\n\nGramont had obtained a small apartment _en pension_--a quiet and\nseverely retired house in Burgundy Street, maintained by a very proud\nold lady whose ancestors had come out of Canada with the Sieur\nd'Iberville. Here Gramont lived with Hammond, quite on a basis of\nequality, and they were very comfortable.\n\nThe two men sat smoking their pipes before the fireplace, in which\nblazed a small fire--more for good cheer than through necessity. It was\nSunday evening. Between Gramont and Hammond had arisen a discussion\nregarding their relations--a discussion which was perhaps justified by\nGramont's quixotic laying down of the law.\n\n\"It's all very well, Hammond,\" he mused, \"to follow custom and\nprecedent, to present to the world a front which will not shock its\nproprieties, its sense of tradition and fitness. In the world's eye you\nare my chauffeur. But when we're alone together--nonsense!\"\n\n\"That's all right, cap'n,\" said Hammond, shrewdly. To him, Gramont was\nalways \"cap'n\" and nothing else. \"But you know's well as I do it can't\ngo on forever. I'm workin' for you, and that's the size of it. I ain't\ngot the education to stack up alongside of you. I don't want you to get\nthe notion that I'm figuring on takin' advantage of you----\"\n\n\"Bosh! I suppose some day I'll be wealthy, married, and bound in the\nchains of social usage and custom,\" said Gramont, energetically. \"But\nthat day isn't here yet. If you think I'll accept deference and\nservility from any man who has endured the same hunger and cold and\nwounds that I endured in France--then guess again! We're friends in a\ndemocracy of Americans. You're just as good a man as I am, and vice\nversa. Besides, aren't we fellow criminals?\"\n\nHammond grinned at this. There was no lack of shrewd intelligence in his\nbroad and powerful features, which were crowned by a rim of reddish\nhair.\n\n\"All that line o' bull sounds good, cap'n, only it's away off,\" he\nreturned. \"Trouble with you is, you ain't forgot the war yet.\"\n\n\"I never will,\" said Gramont, his face darkening.\n\n\"Sure you will! We all will. And you ain't as used to this country as I\nam, either. I've seen too much of it. You ain't seen enough.\"\n\n\"I've seen enough to know that it's my country.\"\n\n\"Right. But I ain't as good a man as you are, not by a long shot!\" said\nHammond, cheerfully. \"You proved that the night you caught me comin'\ninto the window at the Lavergne house. You licked me without half\ntryin', cap'n!\n\n\"Anyhow,\" pursued Hammond, \"America ain't a democracy, unless you're\nrunnin' for Congress. It sounds good to the farmers, but wait till\nyou've been here long enough to get out of your fine notions! Limousines\nand money ain't got much use for democracy. The men who have brains,\nlike you, always will give orders, I reckon.\"\n\n\"Bosh!\" said Gramont again. \"It isn't a question of having brains. It's\na question of knowing what to do with them. All men are born free and\nequal----\"\n\n\"Not much!\" retorted the other with conviction. \"All men were born free,\nbut mighty few were born equal, cap'n. That sort o' talk sounds good in\nthe newspapers, but it don't go very far with the guy at the bottom, nor\nthe top, either!\"\n\nGramont stared into the flickering fire and sucked at his pipe. He\nrealized that in a sense Hammond was quite correct in his argument;\nnonetheless, he looked on the other man as a comrade, and always would\ndo so. It was true that he had not forgotten the war. Suddenly he roused\nhimself and shot a glance at Hammond.\n\n\"Sergeant! You seem to have a pretty good recollection of that night at\nthe Lavergne house, when I found you entering and jumped on you.\"\n\n\"You bet I have!\" Hammond chuckled. \"When you'd knocked the goggles off\nme and we recognized each other--hell! I felt like a boob.\"\n\nGramont smiled. \"How many places had you robbed up to then? Three,\nwasn't it?\"\n\n\"Three is right, cap'n,\" was the unashamed response.\n\n\"We haven't referred to it very often, but now things have happened.\"\nGramont's face took on harsh lines of determination. \"Do you know, it\nwas a lucky thing that you had no chance to dispose of the jewels and\nmoney you obtained? But I suppose you didn't call it good luck at the\ntime.\"\n\n\"No chance?\" snorted the other. \"No chance is right, cap'n! And I was\nsore, too. Say, they got a ring of crooks around this town you couldn't\nbust into with grenades! I couldn't figure it out for a while, but only\nthe other day I got the answer. Listen here, and I'll tell you something\nbig.\"\n\nHammond leaned forward, lowered his voice, and tamped at his pipe.\n\n\"When I was a young fellow I lived in a little town up North--I ain't\nsayin' where. My old man had a livery stable there, see? Well, one night\na guy come along and got the old man out of bed, and slips him fifteen\nhundred for a rig and a team, see? I drove the guy ten miles through the\nhills, and set him on a road he wanted to find.\n\n\"Now, that guy was the biggest crook in the country in them days--still\nis, I guess. He was on the dead run that night, to keep out o'\nLeavenworth. He kep' out, all right, and he's settin' in the game to\nthis minute. Nobody never pinched him yet, and never will.\"\n\nGramont's face had tensed oddly as he listened. Now he shot out a single\nword:\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Because his gang runs back to politicians and rich guys all over the\ncountry. You ask anybody on the inside if they ever heard of Memphis\nIzzy Gumberts! Well, cap'n, I seen that very identical guy on the street\nthe other day--I never could forget his ugly mug! And where _he_ is, no\noutside crooks can get in, you believe me!\"\n\n\"Hm! Memphis Izzy Gumberts, eh? What kind of a crook is he, sergeant?\"\n\n\"The big kind. You remember them Chicago lotteries? But you don't, o'\ncourse. Well, that's his game--lotteries and such like.\"\n\nGramont's lips clenched for a minute, then he spoke with slow\ndistinctness:\n\n\"Sergeant, I'd have given five hundred dollars for that information a\nweek ago!\"\n\n\"Why?\" Hammond stared at him suddenly. Gramont shook his head.\n\n\"Never mind. Forget it! Now, this stunt of yours was clever. You showed\nbrains when you got yourself up as an aviator and pulled that stuff,\nsergeant. But you handled it brutally--terribly brutally.\"\n\n\"It was a little raw, I guess,\" conceded Hammond. \"I was up against it,\nthat's all--I figured they'd pinch me sooner or later, but I didn't\ncare, and that's the truth! I was out for the coin.\n\n\"When you took over the costume and began to get across with the Raffles\nstuff--why, it was a pipe for you, cap'n! Look what we've done in a\nmonth. Six jobs, every one running off smooth as glass! Your notion of\ngoing to parties ready dressed with some kind of loose robe over the\nflyin' duds was a scream! And then me running that motor with the cutout\non--all them birds that never heard an airplane think you come and go by\nair, for certain! I will say that I ain't on to why you're doing it;\njust the same, you've got them all fooled, and I ain't worried a\nparticle about the cops or the crooks, either one. But watch out for the\nGumberts crowd! They're liable to show us up to the bulls, simply\nbecause we ain't in with 'em. Nobody else will ever find us out.\"\n\nGramont nodded thoughtfully.\n\n\"Yes? But, sergeant, how about the quiet little man who came along last\nnight at the Maillard house and asked about the car? Perhaps he had\ndiscovered you had been running the engine.\"\n\n\"Him?\" Hammond sniffed in scorn. \"He wasn't no dick.\"\n\n\"Well, I was followed to-day; at least, I think I was. I could spot\nnobody after me, but I felt certain of it. And let me tell you something\nabout that same quiet little man! His name is Jachin Fell.\"\n\n\"Heluva name,\" commented Hammond, and wrinkled up his brow. \"Jachin,\nhuh? Seems like I've heard the name before. Out o' the Bible, ain't it?\nSomething about Jachin and Boaz?\"\n\n\"I imagine so.\" Gramont smiled as he replied. \"Fell is a lawyer, but he\nnever practises law. He's rich, he's a very fine chess player--and\nprobably the smartest man in New Orleans, sergeant. Just what he does I\ndon't know; no one does. I imagine that he's one of those quiet men who\nstay in the backgrounds of city politics and pull the strings. You know,\none administration has been in power here for nearly twenty years--it's\nsomething to make a man stop and think!\n\n\"This chap Fell is sharp, confoundedly sharp!\" went on Gramont, while\nthe chauffeur listened with frowning intentness. \"He's altogether too\nsharp to be a criminal--or I'd suspect that he was using his knowledge\nof the law to beat the law. Well, I think that he is on to me, and is\ntrying to get the goods on me.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said Hammond. \"And someone was trailin' you? Think he's put the\nbulls wise?\"\n\nGramont shrugged his shoulders. \"I don't know. He almost caught me last\nnight. We'll have to get rid of that aviator's suit at once, and of the\nloot also. I suppose you've reconciled yourself to returning the stuff?\"\n\nHammond stirred uneasily, and laid down his pipe.\n\n\"Look here, cap'n,\" he said, earnestly. \"I wasn't runnin' a holdup game\nbecause I liked it, and I wasn't doing it for the fun of the thing, like\nyou are. I was dead broke, I hadn't any hope left, and I didn't care a\ndamn whether I lived or died--that's on the dead! Right there, you come\nalong and picked me up.\n\n\"You give me a job. What's more, you've treated me white, cap'n. I guess\nyou seen that I was just a man with the devil at his heels, and you\nchased the devil off. You've given me something decent to live for--to\nmake good because you got some faith in me! Why, when you went out on\nthat first job of ours, d'you know it like to broke me up? It did. Only,\nwhen we got home that night and you said it was all a joke, and you'd\nsend back the loot later on, then I begun to feel better about it. Even\nif you'd gone into it as a reg'lar business, I'd have stuck with\nyou--but I was darned glad about its bein' a joke!\"\n\nGramont nodded in comprehension of the other's feeling.\n\n\"It's not been altogether a joke, sergeant,\" he said, gravely. \"To tell\nthe truth, I did start it as a joke, but soon afterward I learned\nsomething that led me to keep it up. I kept it up until I could hit the\nMaillard house. It was my intention to turn up at the Comus ball, on\nTuesday night, and there make public restitution of the stuff--but\nthat's impossible now. I dare not risk it! That man Fell is too smart.\"\n\n\"You're not goin' to pull the trick again, then?\" queried Hammond,\neagerly.\n\n\"No. I'm through. I've got what I wanted. Still, I don't wish to return\nthe stuff before Wednesday--Ash Wednesday, the end of the carnival\nseason. Suppose you get out the loot and find me some boxes. And be sure\nthey have no name on them or any store labels.\"\n\nHammond leaped up and vanished in the room adjoining. Presently he\nreturned, bearing several cardboard boxes which he dumped on the centre\ntable. Gramont examined them closely, and laid aside a number that were\nbest suited to his purpose. Meantime, the chauffeur was opening a\nsteamer trunk which he pulled from under the bed.\n\n\"I'm blamed glad you're done, believe me!\" he uttered, fervently,\nglancing up at Gramont. \"Far's I'm concerned I don't care much, but I'd\nsure hate to see the bulls turn in a guy like you, cap'n. You couldn't\never persuade anybody that it was all a joke, neither, once they nabbed\nyou. They're a bad bunch o' bulls in this town--it ain't like Chi or\nother places, where you can stand in right and do a bit o' fixing.\"\n\n\"You seem to know the game pretty well,\" and Gramont smiled amusedly.\n\n\"Ain't I been a chauffeur and garage man?\" retorted Hammond, as though\nthis explained much. \"If there's anything us guys don't run up against,\nyou can't name it! Here we are. Want me to keep each bunch separate,\ndon't you?\"\n\n\"Sure. I'll be writing some notes to go inside.\"\n\nGramont went to a buhl writing desk in the corner of the room, and sat\ndown. He took out his notebook, tore off several sheets, and from his\npocket produced a pencil having an extremely hard lead. He wrote a\nnumber of notes, which, except for the addresses, were identical in\ncontent:\n\n    DEAR SIR:\n\n    I enclose herewith certain jewellery and articles, also\n    currency, recently obtained by me under your kind auspices.\n\n    I trust that you will assume the responsibility of returning\n    these things to the various guests who lost them while under\n    your roof. I regret any discomfort occasioned by my taking them\n    as a loan, which I now return. Please convey to the several\n    owners my profound esteem and my assurance that I shall not in\n    future appear to trouble any one, the carnival season having\n    come to an end, and with it my little jest.\n\n                                           THE MIDNIGHT MASQUER.\n\nGathering up these notes in his hand, Gramont went to the fireplace. He\ntossed the pencil into the fire, following it with the notebook.\n\n\"Can't take chances with that man Fell,\" he explained. \"All ready,\nsergeant. Let's go down the list one by one.\"\n\nFrom the trunk Hammond produced ticketed packages, which he placed on\nthe table. Gramont selected one, opened it, carefully packed the\ncontents in one of the boxes, placed the proper addressed note on top,\nand handed it to the chauffeur.\n\n\"Wrap it up and address it. Give the return address of John Smith, Bayou\nTeche.\"\n\nOne by one they went through the packages of loot in the same manner.\nBefore them on the table, as they worked, glittered little heaps of\nrings, brooches, watches, currency; jewels that flashed garishly with\ncoloured fires, historic and famous jewels plucked from the aristocratic\nheart of the southland, heirlooms of a past generation side by side with\nplatinum crudities of the present fashion.\n\nThere had been heartburnings in the loss of these things, Gramont knew.\nHe could picture to himself something of what had followed his\nrobberies: family quarrels, new purchases in the gem marts, bitter\nreproaches, fresh mortgages on old heritages, vexations of wealthy\ndowagers, shrugs of unconcern by the _nouveaux riches_; perchance lives\naltered--deaths--divorces----\n\n\"There's a lot of human life behind these baubles, sergeant,\" he\nreflected aloud, a cold smile upon his lips as he worked. \"When they\ncome back to their owners, I'd like to be hovering around in an\ninvisible mantle to watch results! Could we only know it, we're probably\naffecting the lives of a great many people--for good and ill. These\nthings stand for money; and there's nothing like money, or the lack of\nit, to guide the destinies of people.\"\n\n\"You said it,\" and Hammond grinned. \"I'm here to prove it, ain't I? I\nain't pulling no more gunplay, now I got me a steady job.\"\n\n\"And a steady friend, old man,\" added Gramont. \"Did it occur to you that\nmaybe I was as much in need of a friend as you were?\"\n\nHe had come to the last box now, that which must go to Joseph Maillard.\nOn top of the money and scarfpins which he placed in the box he laid a\nthin packet of papers. He tapped them with his finger.\n\n\"Those papers, sergeant! To get them, I've been playing the whole game.\nTo get them and not to let their owner suspect that I was after them!\nNow they're going back to their owner.\"\n\n\"Who's he?\" demanded Hammond.\n\n\"Young Maillard--son of the banker. He roped me into an oil company;\ncaught me, like a sucker, almost the first week I was here. I put pretty\nnear my whole wad into that company of his.\"\n\n\"You mean he stung you?\"\n\n\"Not yet.\" Gramont smiled coldly, harshly. \"That was his intention; he\nthought I was a Frenchman who would fall for any sort of game. I fell\nright enough--but I'll come out on top of the heap.\"\n\nThe other frowned. \"I don't get you, cap'n. Some kind o' stock deal?\"\n\n\"Yes, and no.\" Gramont paused, and seemed to choose his words with care.\n\"Miss Ledanois, the lady who was driving with us this afternoon, is an\nold friend of mine. I've known for some time that somebody was fleecing\nher. I suspected that it was Maillard the elder, for he has had the\nhandling of her affairs for some time past. Now, however, those papers\nhave given me the truth. He was straight enough with her; his son was\nthe man.\n\n\"The young fool imagines that by trickery and juggling he is playing the\ngame of high finance! He worked on his father, made his father sell land\nowned by Miss Ledanois, and he himself reaped the profits. There are\nnotes and stock issues among those papers that give his whole game away,\nto my eyes. Not legal evidence, as I had hoped, but evidence enough to\nshow me the truth of things--to show me that he's a scoundrel! Further,\nthey bear on my own case, and I'm satisfied now that I'd be ruined if I\nstayed with him.\"\n\n\"Well, that's easy settled,\" said Hammond. \"Just hold him up with them\npapers--make him come across!\"\n\n\"I'm not in that sort of business. I stole those papers, not to use them\nfor blackmail, but to get information. By the way, get that tin box out\nof my trunk, will you? I want to take my stock certificates with me in\nthe morning, and must not forget them.\"\n\nHammond disappeared into the adjoining room.\n\nGramont sat gazing at the boxes before him. Despite his words to\nHammond, there was a fund of puzzled displeasure in his eyes, sheer\ndissatisfaction. He shook his head gloomily, and his eyes clouded.\n\n\"All wasted--the whole effort!\" he murmured. \"I thought it might lead to\nsomething, but all it has given me is the reward of saving myself and\npossibly retrieving Lucie. As for the larger game, the bigger\nquarry--it's all wasted. I haven't unravelled a single thread; the first\nreal clue came to me to-night, purely by accident. Memphis Izzy\nGumberts! That's the lead to follow! I'll get rid of this Midnight\nMasquer foolishness and go after the real game.\"\n\nGramont was to discover that it is not nearly so easy to be rid of folly\nas it is to don the jester's cap and bells; a fact which one\nSimplicissimus had discovered to his sorrow three hundred years earlier.\nBut, as Gramont was not versed in this line of literature, he yet had\nthe discovery ahead of him.\n\nHammond re\u00c3\u00abntered the room with the tin box, from which Gramont took his\nstock certificates issued by Bob Maillard's oil company. He pocketed the\nshares.\n\n\"Does this here Miss Ledanois,\" asked Hammond, \"play in with you in the\ngame? Young Maillard's related to her, ain't he?\"\n\n\"She's quite aware of his drawbacks, I think,\" answered Gramont, drily.\n\n\"I see.\" Hammond rubbed his chin, and inspected his employer with a\ntwinkle denoting perfect comprehension. \"Well, how d'you expect to come\nout on top of the heap?\"\n\n\"I want to get my own money back,\" explained Gramont. \"You see, young\nMaillard thinks that he's cleaned me up fine. I've invested heavily in\nhis company, which has a couple of small wells already going. As I\nconceive the probable scheme, this company is scheduled to fail, and\nanother company will take over the stock at next to nothing. Maillard\nwill be the other company; his present associates will be the suckers!\nIt's that, or some similar trick. I'm no longer interested in the\naffair.\"\n\n\"Why not, if you got money in it?\"\n\n\"My son, to-morrow is Monday. Proteus will arrive out of the sea\nto-morrow, and the Proteus ball comes off to-morrow night. In spite of\nthese distractions, the banks are open in the morning. Savvy?\n\n\"I'll go to Maillard the banker--Joseph Maillard--first thing in the\nmorning, and offer him my stock. He'll be mighty glad to get it at a\ndiscount, knowing that it is in his son's company. You see, the son\ndoesn't confide in the old man particularly. I'll let the father win a\nlittle money on the deal with me, and by doing this I'll manage to save\nthe greater part of my investment----\"\n\n\"Holy mackerel!\" Hammond exploded in a burst of laughter as he caught\nthe idea. \"Say, if this ain't the richest thing ever pulled! When the\ncrash comes, the fancy kid will be stinging his dad good and hard, eh?\"\n\n\"Exactly; and I think his dad can afford to be stung much better than I\ncan,\" agreed Gramont, cheerfully. \"Also, now that I'm certain Bob\nMaillard is the one who was behind the fleecing of Miss Ledanois, I'll\nfirst get clear of him, then I'll start to give him his deserts. I may\nform an oil company of my own.\"\n\n\"Do it,\" advised Hammond, still chuckling.\n\n\"Now,\" and Gramont rose, \"let's take those packages and stow them away\nin the luggage compartment of the car. I'm getting nervous at the\nthought of having them around here, and they'll be perfectly safe there\novernight--safer there than here, in fact. To-morrow, you can take the\ncar out of town and send the packages by parcels post from some small\ntown.\n\n\"In that way they ought to be delivered here on Wednesday. You'd better\nwear one of my suits, leaving your chauffeur's outfit here, and don't\nhalt the car in front of the postoffice where you mail the packages----\"\n\n\"I get you,\" assented Hammond, sagely. \"I'll leave the car outside town,\nand hoof it in with the boxes, so that nobody will notice the car or\nconnect it with the packages, eh? But what about them aviator's\nclothes?\"\n\n\"Take them with you--better get them wrapped up here and now. You can\ntoss them into a ditch anywhere.\"\n\nHammond obeyed.\n\nTen minutes afterward the two men left the room, carrying the packages\nof loot and the bundle containing the aviator's uniform. They descended\nto the courtyard in the rear of the house. Here was a small garden, with\na fountain in its centre. Behind this were the stables, which had long\nbeen disused as such, and which were now occupied only by the car of\nGramont.\n\nIt was with undisguised relief that Gramont now saw the stuff actually\nout of the house. Within the last few hours he had become intensely\nafraid of Jachin Fell. Concentrating himself upon the man, picking up\ninformation guardedly, he had that day assimilated many small items\nwhich increased his sense of peril from that quarter. Straws, no more,\nbut quite significant straws. Gramont realized clearly that if the\npolice ever searched his rooms and found this loot, he would be lost.\nThere could be no excuse that would hold water for a minute against such\nevidence.\n\nIn the garage, Hammond switched on the lights of the car. By the glow\nthey disposed their burdens in the luggage compartment of the tonneau,\nwhich held them neatly. The car was a large twelve-cylinder,\nfour-passenger Nonpareil, which Gramont had picked up in the used-car\nmarket. Hammond had tinkered it into magnificent shape, and loved the\npiece of mechanism as the very apple of his eye.\n\nThe luggage compartment closed and locked, they returned into the house\nand dismissed the affair as settled.\n\nUpon the following morning Gramont, who usually breakfasted _en pension_\nwith his hostess, had barely seated himself at the table when he\nperceived the figure of Hammond at the rear entrance of the dining room.\nThe chauffeur beckoned him hastily.\n\n\"Come out here, cap'n!\" Hammond was breathing heavily, and seemed to be\nin some agitation. \"Want to show you somethin'!\"\n\n\"Is there anything important?\" Gramont hesitated. The other regarded him\nwith a baleful countenance.\n\n\"Important? Worse'n that!\"\n\nGramont rose and followed Hammond out to the garage, much to his\namazement. The chauffeur halted beside the car and extended him a key,\npointing to the luggage compartment.\n\n\"Here's the key--you open her!\"\n\n\"What's the matter, man?\"\n\n\"The stuff's gone!\"\n\nGramont seized the key and opened the compartment. It proved empty\nindeed. He stared up into the face of Hammond who was watching in dogged\nsilence.\n\n\"I knew you'd suspect me,\" broke out the chauffeur, but Gramont\ninterrupted him curtly.\n\n\"Don't be a fool; nothing of the sort. Was the garage locked?\"\n\n\"Yes, and the compartment, too! I came out to look over that cut tire,\nand thought I'd make sure the stuff was safe----\"\n\n\"We're up against it, that's all.\" Gramont compressed his lips for a\nmoment. Then he straightened up and clapped the other on the shoulder.\n\"Buck up! I never thought of suspecting you, old fellow. Someone must\nhave been watching us last night, eh?\"\n\n\"The guy that trailed you yesterday, most like,\" agreed Hammond, dourly.\n\"It ain't hard to break into this place, and any one could open that\ncompartment with a hairpin.\"\n\n\"Well, you're saved a trip into the country.\"\n\n\"You think they got us, cap'n? What can we do?\"\n\n\"Do?\" Gramont shrugged his shoulders and laughed. \"Nothing except to\nwait and see what happens next! If you want to run, I'll give you enough\nmoney to land you in New York or Frisco----\"\n\n\"Run--hell!\" Hammond sniffed in scorn. \"What d'you think I am--a boche?\nI'll stick.\"\n\n\"Good boy.\" Gramont turned toward the house. \"Come along in and get\nbreakfast, and don't touch that compartment door. I want to examine it\nlater.\"\n\nHammond gazed admiringly after him as he crossed the garden. \"If you\nain't a cool hand, I'm a Dutchman!\" he murmured, and followed his\nmaster.\n\n\n\n\n                               CHAPTER VI\n\n                               _Chacherre_\n\n\nAt ten o'clock that Monday morning Gramont's car approached Canal\nStreet, and halted a block distant. For any car to gain Canal, much less\nto follow it, was impossible. From curb to curb the wide avenue was\nthronged with carnival folk, who would hold their own until Proteus came\nashore to manage his own parade and his own section of the festivities.\n\nGramont left the car, and turned to speak with Hammond.\n\n\"I've made out at least two fingerprints on the luggage compartment,\" he\nsaid, quietly. \"Drive around to police headquarters and enter a\ncomplaint in my name to a robbery of the compartment; say that the thief\ngot away with some valuable packages I had been about to mail. They have\na process of transferring fingerprints such as these; get it done.\nPerhaps they can identify the thief, for it must have been some clever\npicklock to get into the compartment without leaving a scratch. Take\nyour time about it and come home when you've finished.\"\n\nHammond listened stolidly. \"If it was the bulls done it, cap'n, going to\nthem will get us pinched sure----\"\n\n\"If they had done it,\" said Gramont, \"we'd have been pinched long before\nthis! It was someone sent by that devil Jachin Fell, and I'll land him\nif I can!\"\n\n\"Then Fell will land us if he's got the stuff!\"\n\n\"Let him! How can he prove anything, unless he had brought the police to\nopen up that compartment? Get along with you!\"\n\nHammond grinned, saluted, and drove away.\n\nSlowly Gramont edged his way through the eddying crowds to Canal Street,\nand presently gained the imposing portals of the Exeter National Bank.\nEntering the building, he sent his card to the private office of the\npresident; a moment later he was ushered in, and was closeted with\nJoseph Maillard.\n\nThe interior of the Exeter National reflected the stern personality that\nruled it. The bank was dark, old fashioned, conservative, guarded with\nmuch effrontery of iron grills and bars against the evil doer.\n\nThe window men greeted their customers with infrequent smiles, with\ncaution and reserve so great that it was positively chilly. Suspicion\nseemed in the air. The bank's reputation for guarding the sanctity of\nwealth seemed to rest heavily upon each pair of bowed shoulders. Even\nthe stenographers were unhandsome women, weary-eyed, drearily efficient,\nand obviously respectable.\n\nAs befitted so old and conservative a New Orleans institution, much of\nits business was transacted in French.\n\nThe business customers of this bank found their affairs handled coldly,\nefficiently, with an inhuman precision that was admirable. It was good\nfor business, and they liked it. There were no mistakes.\n\nPeople who were accustomed to dealing with bankers of cordial smile and\ncourteous word, people who liked to walk into a bank and to be met with\na personal greeting, did not come here, nor were they wanted here. The\nExeter National was a place for business, not for courtesy. It was\nabsolutely precise, cold, inhuman, and spelled business from the ground\nup. Its oldest customer could not buy a draft on Paris or London or\nother of the bank's correspondents without paying the required fee. The\nwealthiest depositor could not expect to overdraw his checking account\none dollar without being required to settle up before the next day was\ngone. Loans were made hesitatingly, grudgingly, and of necessity, always\non security and never on character.\n\nSuch was the Exeter National. Its character was reflected in the cold\nfaces at its windows, and the chance customers who entered its sacred\nportals were duly cowed and put in their proper place. Most of them\nwere, that is. Occasionally some intrepid soul appeared who seemed\nimpervious to the gloomy chill, who seemed even to resent it. One of\nthese persons was now standing in the lobby and staring around with a\ncool impudence which drew unfavourable glances from the clerks.\n\nHe was a decently dressed fellow, obviously no customer of this\nsacrosanct place, obviously a stranger to its interior. Beneath a\nrakishly cocked soft hat beamed a countenance that bore a look of\nself-assured impertinent deviltry. After one look at that countenance\nthe assistant cashier crooked a hasty finger at the floor guard, who\nnodded and walked over to the intruder with a polite query.\n\n\"Can I help you, sir?\"\n\nThe intruder turned, favoured the guard with a cool stare, then broke\ninto a laugh and a flood of Creole dialect.\n\n\"Why, if it isn't old Lacroix from Carencro! And look at the brass\nbuttons--_diable_! You must own this place, hein? _la tch\u00c3\u00a8 chatte pouss\u00c3\u00a9\navec temps_--the cat's tail grows in time, I see! You remember me?\"\n\n\"Ben Chacherre!\" exclaimed the guard, losing his dignity for an instant.\n\"Why--you _vaurien_, you! You who disappeared from the parish and became\na vagrant----\"\n\n\"So you turn up your sanctified nose at Ben Chacherre, do you?\"\nexclaimed that person jauntily. He thrust his hat a bit farther over one\near, and proceeded to snap his fingers under the nose of Lacroix.\n\n\"A _vaurien_, am I? Old peacock! Lead me to the man who cashes checks,\nlackey, brass buttons that you are! Come, obey me, or I'll have you\nthrown into the street!\"\n\n\"You--you wish to cash a check?\" The guard was overcome by confusion,\nfor the loud tones of Chacherre penetrated the entire institution. \"But\nyou are not known here----\"\n\n\"Bah, insolent one! _Macaque dan calebasse_--monkey in the calabash that\nyou are! Do you not know me?\"\n\n\"Heaven preserve me! I will not answer for your accursed checks.\"\n\n\"Go to the devil, then,\" snapped Chacherre, and turned away.\n\nHis roving eyes had already found the correct window by means of the\nother persons seeking it, and now he stepped into the small queue that\nhad formed. When it came his turn, he slid his check across the marble\nslab, tucked his thumbs into the armholes of his vest, and impudently\nstared into the questioning, coldly repellent eyes of the teller.\n\n\"Well?\" he exclaimed, as the teller examined the check. \"Do you wish to\neat it, that you sniff so hard?\"\n\nThe teller gave him a glance. \"This is for a thousand dollars----\"\n\n\"Can I not read?\" said Chacherre, with an impudent gesture. \"Am I an\nignorant 'Cajun? Have I not eyes in my head? If you wish to start an\nargument, say that the check is for a hundred dollars. Then, by heaven,\nI will argue something with you!\"\n\n\"You are Ben Chacherre, eh? Does any one here know you?\"\n\nChacherre exploded in a violent oath. \"Dolt that you are, do I have to\nbe known when the check is endorsed under my signature? Who taught you\nbusiness, monkey?\"\n\n\"True,\" answered the teller, sulkily. \"Yet the amount----\"\n\n\"Oh, bah!\" Chacherre snapped his fingers. \"Go and telephone Jachin Fell,\nyou old woman! Go and tell him you do not know his signature--well, who\nare you looking at? Am I a telephone, then? You are not hired to look\nbut to act! Get about it.\"\n\nThe enraged and scandalized teller beckoned a confrere. Jachin Fell was\ntelephoned. Presumably his response was reassuring, for Chacherre was\npresently handed a thousand dollars in small bills, as he requested. He\ninsisted upon counting over the money at the window with insolent\nassiduity, flung a final compliment at the teller, and swaggered across\nthe lobby. He was still standing by the entrance when Henry Gramont left\nthe private office of the president and passed him by without a look.\n\nGramont was smiling to himself as he left the bank, and Ben Chacherre\nwas whistling gaily as he also left and plunged into the whirling vortex\nof the carnival crowds.\n\nToward noon Gramont arrived afoot at his pension. Finding the rooms\nempty, he went on and passed through the garden. Behind the garage, in\nthe alley, he discovered Hammond busily at work cleaning and polishing\nthe engine of the car.\n\n\"Hello!\" he exclaimed, cheerily. \"What luck?\"\n\n\"Pretty good, cap'n.\" Hammond glanced up, then paused.\n\nA stranger was strolling toward them along the alleyway, a jaunty\nindividual who was gaily whistling and who seemed entirely carefree and\nhappy. He appeared to have no interest whatever in them, and Hammond\nconcluded that he was innocuous.\n\n\"They got them prints fine, cap'n. What's more, they think they've\nlocated the fellow that made 'em.\"\n\n\"Ah, good work!\" exclaimed Gramont. \"Some criminal?\"\n\nHammond frowned. The stranger had come to a halt a few feet distant,\nflung them a jerky, careless nod, and was beginning to roll a cigarette.\nHe surveyed the car with a knowing and appreciative eye. Hammond turned\nhis back on the man disdainfully.\n\n\"Yep--a sneak thief they'd pinched a couple of years back; didn't know\nwhere he was, but the prints seemed to fit him. They'll come up and look\nthings over sometime to-day, then go after him and land him.\"\n\nGramont gave the stranger a glance, but the other was still surveying\nthe car with evident admiration. If he heard their words he gave them no\nattention.\n\n\"Who was the man, then?\" asked Gramont.\n\n\"A guy with a queer name--Ben Chacherre.\" Hammond pronounced it as he\ndeemed correct--as the name was spelled. \"Only they didn't call him\nthat. Here, I wrote it down.\"\n\nHe fished in his pocket and produced a paper. Gramont glanced at it and\nlaughed.\n\n\"Oh, Chacherre!\" He gave the name the Creole pronunciation.\n\n\"Yep, Sasherry. I expect they'll come any time now--said two bulls would\ndrop in.\"\n\n\"All right.\" Gramont nodded and turned away, with another glance at the\nstranger. \"I'll not want the car to-day nor to-night that I know of. I'm\nnot going to the Proteus ball. So your time's your own until to-morrow;\nmake the most of it!\"\n\nHe disappeared, and Hammond returned to his work. Then he straightened\nup, for the jaunty stranger was bearing down upon him with evident\nintent to speak.\n\n\"Some car you got there, brother!\" Ben Chacherre, who had overheard most\nof the foregoing conversation, lighted his cigarette and grinned\nfamiliarly. \"Some car, eh?\"\n\n\"She's a boat, all right,\" conceded Hammond, grudgingly. He did not like\nthe other's looks, although praise of the car was sweet unto his soul.\n\"She sure steps some.\"\n\n\"Yes. All she needs,\" drawled Chacherre, \"is some good tires, a new coat\nof paint, a good steel chassis, and a new engine----\"\n\n\"Huh?\" snorted Hammond. \"Say, you 'bo, who sold you chips in this game?\nMove along!\"\n\nBen grinned anew and rested himself against a near-by telephone pole.\n\n\"Free country, ain't it?\" he inquired, lazily. \"Or have you invested\nyour winnings and bought this here alley?\"\n\nHammond reddened with anger and took a step forward. The next words of\nChacherre, however, jerked him sharply into self-control.\n\n\"Seen anything of an aviator's helmet around here?\"\n\n\"Huh?\" The chauffeur glared at his tormentor, yet with a sudden sick\nfeeling inside his bosom. He suddenly realized that the man's eyes were\nmeeting his squarely, with a bold and insolent directness. \"Who you\nkiddin' now?\"\n\n\"Nobody. I was asking a question, that's all.\" Ben Chacherre flung away\nhis cigarette, untangled himself from the telephone pole, and moved\naway. \"Only,\" he flung over his shoulder, \"I was flyin' along here last\nnight in my airplane, and I lost my helmet overboard. Thought maybe\nyou'd seen it. So long, brother!\"\n\nHammond stood staring after the swaggering figure; for once he was\nspeechless. The jaunty words had sent terror thrilling into him. He\nstarted impulsively to pursue that impudent accoster--then he checked\nhimself. Had the man guessed something? Had the man known something? Or\nhad those words been only a bit of meaningless impertinence--a chance\nshaft which had accidentally flown home?\n\nThe last conjecture impressed itself on Hammond as being the truth, and\nhis momentary fright died out. He concluded that the incident was not\nworth mentioning to Gramont, who surely had troubles enough of his own\nat this juncture. So he held his peace about it.\n\nAs for Ben Chacherre, he sauntered from the alley, a careless whistle\nupon his lips. Once out of Hammond's sight, however, he quickened his\npace. Turning into a side street, he directed his step toward that part\nof the old quarter which, in the days before prohibition, had been given\nover to low cabarets and dives of various sorts. Most of these places\nwere now boarded up, and presumably abandoned. Coming to one of them,\nwhich appeared more dirty and desolate than the rest, Chacherre opened a\nside door and vanished.\n\nHe entered what had once been the Red Cat cabaret. At a table in the\nhalf-darkened main room sat two men. A slovenly waiter pored over a\nnewspaper at another table in a far corner. The two in the centre nodded\nto Chacherre. One of them, who was the proprietor, jerked his chin in an\ninvitation to join them.\n\nA man famous in the underworld circles, a man whose renown rested on\ncurious feats and facts, this proprietor; few crooks in the country had\nnot heard the name of Memphis Izzy Gumberts. He was a grizzled old bear\nnow; but in times past he had been the head of a far-flung organization\nwhich, on each pay day, covered every army post in the country and\ndiverted into its own pockets about two thirds of Uncle Sam's payroll--a\nfeat still related in criminal circles as the _ne plus ultra_ of\nsuccess. Those palmy days were gone, but Memphis Izzy, who had never\nbeen \"mugged\" in any gallery, sat in his deserted cabaret and still did\nnot lack for power and influence.\n\nThe man at his side was apparently not anxious to linger, for he rose\nand made his farewells as Chacherre approached.\n\n\"We have about eighteen cars left,\" he said to Gumberts. \"Charley the\nGoog can attend to them, and the place is safe enough. They're up to\nyou. I'm drifting back to Chi.\"\n\n\"Drift along,\" and Gumberts nodded, a leer in his eyes. His face was\nbroad, heavy-jowled, filled with a keen and forceful craft. \"It's a\ncinch that nobody in this state is goin' to interfere with us. About\nthem cars from Texas--any news?\"\n\n\"I've sent orders to bring 'em in next week.\"\n\nGumberts nodded again, and the man departed. Into the chair which he had\nvacated dropped Ben Chacherre, and took from his pocket the money which\nhe had obtained at the bank. He laid it on the table before Gumberts.\n\n\"There you are,\" he said. \"Amounts you want and all. The boss says to\ngimme a receipt.\"\n\n\"Wouldn't trust you, eh?\" jeered Gumberts. He took out pencil and paper,\nscrawled a word or two, and shoved the paper at Chacherre. Then he\nreached down to a small satchel which lay open on the floor beside his\nchair. \"Why wouldn't the boss leave the money come out of the takin's,\nhey?\"\n\n\"Wanted to keep separate accounts,\" said Chacherre.\n\nGumberts nodded and produced two large sealed envelopes, which he pushed\nacross the table.\n\n\"There's rakeoff for week before last,\" he announced. \"Last week will be\nthe big business, judgin' from early reports.\"\n\nChacherre pocketed the envelopes, lighted a cigarette, and leaned\nforward.\n\n\"Say, Izzy! You got to send a new man down to the Bayou Latouche right\naway. Lafarge was there, you know; a nigger shot him yesterday. The\nnigger threatened to squeal unless he got his money back--Lafarge was a\nfool and didn't know how to handle him. The lottery's goin' to get a bad\nname around there----\"\n\nGumberts snapped his fingers. \"Let it!\" he said, calmly. \"The big money\nfrom all that section is Chinese and Filipino, my friend. The niggers\ndon't matter.\"\n\n\"Well, the boss says to shoot a new man down there. Also, he says, you'd\nbetter watch out about spreadin' the lottery into Texas and Alabama,\naccount of the government rules.\"\n\nThe heavy features of Gumberts closed in a scowl.\n\n\"You tell your boss,\" he said, \"that when it comes to steerin' clear of\nfederal men, I don't want no instructions from nobody! We got every man\nin this state spotted. Every one that can be fixed is fixed--and that\ngoes for the legislators and politicians clear up the line! Tell your\nboss to handle the local gov'ment as well as I handle other things, and\nhe'll do all that's necessary. What he'd ought to attend to, for one\nthing, is this here guy who calls himself the Midnight Masquer. I've\ntold him before that this guy was playing hell with my system! This\nMasquer gets no protection, see? The quicker Fell goes after him, the\nbetter for all concerned----\"\n\nChacherre laughed, not without a swagger.\n\n\"We've attended to all that, Izzy--we've dropped on him and settled him!\nThe guy was doin' it for a carnival joke, that's all. His loot is all\ngoin' back to the owners to-day. It needn't worry you, anyhow! There was\nnothin' much to it--jewellery that couldn't be disposed of, for the most\npart. We couldn't take chances on that sort o' junk.\"\n\n\"I should say not.\" Gumbert regarded him with a scowl. \"You've got the\nstuff?\"\n\n\"The boss has. Look here, Izzy, I want you to use a little influence\nwith headquarters on this deal--the boss doesn't want to show his hand\nthere,\" and leaning forward, Ben Chacherre spoke in a low tone. Then,\nGumberts heard him out, chuckled, and nodded assent.\n\nAt two that afternoon Henry Gramont, who was writing letters in total\ndisregard of the carnival parade downtown, was summoned to the\ntelephone. He was greeted by a voice which he did not recognize, but\nwhich announced itself promptly.\n\n\"This is Mr. Gramont? Police headquarters speakin'. You laid a charge\nthis morning against a fellow named Chacherre?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" answered Gramont.\n\n\"Must ha' been some mistake, then,\" came the response. \"We thought the\nprints fitted, but found later they didn't. We looked up the Chacherre\nguy and found he was workin' steady and strictly O. K. What's more to\nthe point, he proved up a dead sure alibi for the other night.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said Gramont. \"Then there's nothing to be done?\"\n\n\"Not yet. We're workin' on it, and maybe we'll have some news later.\nGood-bye.\"\n\nGramont hung up the receiver, a puzzled frown creasing his brow. But,\nafter a minute, he laughed softly--a trace of anger in the laugh.\n\n\"Ah!\" he murmured. \"I congratulate you on your efficiency, Mr. Fell! But\nnow wait a little--and we'll meet again. I think I'm getting somewhere\nat last, and I'll have a surprise for you one of these days!\"\n\n\n\n\n                              CHAPTER VII\n\n                             _In The Open_\n\n\nIn New Orleans the carnival season is always opened by the ball of the\nTwelfth Night Revellers soon after Christmas, and is closed by that of\nthe Krewe of Comus on Mardi Gras night. Upon this evening of \"Fat\nTuesday,\" indeed, both Rex and Comus hold forth. Rex is the popular\nball, the affair of the people, and is held in the Athenaeum. From here,\nabout midnight, the king and queen proceed to Comus ball.\n\nComus is an assembly of such rigid exclusiveness that even the tickets\nto the galleries are considered social prizes. The _personae_ of the\nKrewe, on this particular year as in all previous ones, would remain\nunknown; there is no unmasking at Comus. This institution, a tremendous\nsocial power and potentially a financial power also, during decades of\nthe city's life, is held absolutely above any taint of favouritism or\ncommercialism. Even the families of those concerned might not always be\ncertain whether their sons and brothers belonged to the Krewe of Comus.\n\nHenry Gramont did not attend the ball of Proteus on Monday night.\nInstead, he sat in his own room, while through the streets of the\nFrench quarter outside was raging the carnival at its height. Before\nhim were maps and reports upon the gas and oil fields about Bayou\nTerrebonne--fields where great domes of natural gas were already\nlocated and in use, and where oil was being found in some quantity.\nEarly on Wednesday morning Gramont intended to set forth to his work.\nHe had been engaged to make a report to Bob Maillard's company, and he\nwould make it. Then he would resign his advisory job, and be free. A\nsmile curled his lips as he thought of young Maillard and the company.\n\n\"The young gentleman will be sadly surprised to discover that I've\ngotten out from under--and that his respected father holds my stock!\" he\nreflected. \"That was a good deal; I lost a thousand to old Maillard in\norder to save the balance of thirty thousand!\"\n\nA knock at his door interrupted the thread of this thought. Gramont\nopened, to find the concierge with a note which had been left at the\ndoor below by a masked Harlequin, who had then disappeared without\nawaiting any reply.\n\nGramont recognized the writing on the envelope, and hastened to the note\ninside. His face changed, however, as he read it:\n\n    Please call promptly at eleven to-morrow morning. I wish to see\n    you upon a matter of business.\n\n                                                 LUCIE LEDANOIS.\n\nGramont gazed long at this note, his brows drawn down into a harsh line.\nIt was not like Lucie in its tone, somehow; he sensed something amiss,\nsomething vaguely but most decidedly out of tune. Certainly it was not\nher way to write thus curtly and harshly--the words disquieted him. What\ncould have turned up now? Then, with a shrug, he tossed the note on the\ntable.\n\n\"Eleven to-morrow morning, eh?\" he murmured. \"That's queer, too, for\nshe's to be at the Proteus ball to-night. Most girls would not be\nconducting business affairs at eleven in the morning, after being up all\nnight at Proteus! It must be something important. Besides, she's not in\nthe class with any one else. She's a rare girl; no nonsense in her--full\nof a deep, strong sense of things----\"\n\nHe forced himself from thoughts of Lucie, forced himself from her\npersonality, and returned to his reports with an effort of\nconcentration.\n\nGramont wanted to look over her Terrebonne land with a full knowledge of\nits geology and situation. Oil drilling is a gamble in any case, yet\nGramont took a scholar's solid satisfaction in getting his subject\nthoroughly in hand before he went to work at it. Then, he reflected, he\nwould get his task finished as rapidly as might be, turn in his report,\nand resign from the company. After that--freedom! He regretted sadly\nenough that he had ever gone into any relations with Maillard's company.\n\n\"Yet, what's to hinder my going ahead, in the meantime?\" he considered.\n\"What's to hinder getting my own company on its feet? Nothing! All I\nneed is backing. I'll put in twenty-five thousand, and that much more\nadded to it will give us plenty of capital to start in drilling with. If\nI could find someone who had a positive faith in my judgment and whom I\ncould trust in turn----\"\n\nHe checked himself suddenly, and stared at the papers before him with\nwidening eyes. A slow whistle came from his lips, and then he smiled and\npulled the papers to him. Yet, as he worked he could not keep down the\nthought that had forced itself upon him. It was altogether absurd, of\ncourse--yet why not?\n\nWhen Gramont went to bed that night it was with a startling and\naudacious scheme well defined in his brain; a scheme whose first\nconception seemed ludicrous and impossible, yet which, on second\nconsideration, appeared in a very different light. It deserved serious\nthought--and Gramont had made his decision before he went to sleep.\n\nThe following day was Tuesday--Mardi Gras, Shrove Tuesday, the last day\nbefore Lent began, and the final culminating day of carnival. Henry\nGramont, however, was destined to find little in its beginning of much\npersonal pleasure.\n\nAt eleven in the morning Hammond drove him to the Ledanois home, where\nGramont was admitted by one of the coloured servants and shown into the\nparlour. A moment later Lucie herself appeared. At first glance her\nsmiling greeting removed the half-sensed apprehensions of Gramont.\nAlmost immediately afterward, however, he noted a perceptible change in\nher manner, as she led him toward the rear of the room, and gestured\ntoward a mahogany tilt-top table which stood in a corner.\n\n\"Come over here, please. I have something which I wish to show you.\"\n\nShe needed to say no more. Gramont, following her, found himself staring\nblankly down at the symbol of consternation which overwhelmed him. For\nupon that table, lay all those self-same boxes which he himself had\npacked with the loot of the Midnight Masquer--the identical boxes,\napparently unopened, which had been stolen from his automobile by the\nsupposed thief Chacherre!\n\nFor a moment Gramont found himself unable to speak. He was thunderstruck\nby the sight of those unmistakeable boxes. A glance at the calm features\nof the girl showed him that there was nothing to be concealed from her,\neven had he wished it. He was further stunned by this realization. He\ncould not understand how the packages had come here. Recovering his\nvoice with an effort, he managed to break the heavy silence.\n\n\"Well? I suppose you know what is in those parcels?\"\n\nShe nodded. \"Yes. One of them was opened, and the note inside was\ndiscovered. Of course, it gave a general explanation. Will you sit down,\nplease? I think that we had better talk it over quietly and calmly.\"\n\nGramont obeyed, and dropped into a chair.\n\nHe was absurdly conscious of his own confusion. He tried to speak, but\nwords and thoughts failed him. Torn between pride and chagrin, he found\nhimself able to say nothing. Explanations, at any time, came to him with\ndifficulty; now, at least, he felt that he could not lie to this girl.\nAnd how was he to tell her the truth?\n\nAnd how had Lucie come into the affair? This staggered him above all\nelse. Was she behind the theft of the loot? It must be. How long had\nshe suspected him, then? He had thought Jachin Fell the sole\ndanger-point--he had never dreamed that this gray-eyed Athene could be\ntracing down the Masquer! He tried to visualize the situation more\nclearly and his brain whirled. He knew, of course, that she was fairly\nintimate with Fell, but he was not aware of any particular\nconnection----\n\nHe glanced up at her suddenly, and surprised a glint of laughter in her\neyes as she watched him.\n\n\"You seem to be rather astonished,\" she observed.\n\n\"I am.\" Gramont drew a deep breath. \"You--do you know that those boxes\nwere taken from my car?\"\n\nShe nodded again. \"Certainly. They were brought to me.\"\n\n\"Then you had someone on my trail?\" Gramont flushed a little as he put\nthe question to her.\n\n\"No. I have been chosen to settle affairs with you, that is all. It has\nbeen learned from the note in the opened box that you were not criminal\nin what you did.\"\n\nShe leaned forward, her deep eyes searching him with a steady scrutiny.\n\n\"Tell me, Henry Gramont, what mad impulse brought you to all this? Was\nit a silly, boyish effort to be romantic--was it a mere outburst of\nbravado? It was not for the sake of robbery, as the note explained very\nclearly. But why, then? Why? There must have been a definite reason in\nyour mind. You would not have taken such dangerous chances unless you\nhad something to gain!\"\n\nGramont nodded slightly, then flushed again and bit his lip. For a\nmoment he made no response to her query.\n\nHe might, of course, say that he had been the Midnight Masquer because\nof her alone; which would be decidedly untrue. He might tell her, as he\nhad told Hammond, that all his efforts had led up to that scene in the\nMaillard library, when without suspicion by any concerned he might\nverify his own surmise as to who had been defrauding Lucie Ledanois. It\nwould sound very well--but it would be a lie. That had been far from his\nonly reason for playing the Midnight Masquer's game.\n\nBut why tell her anything?\n\nA slight smile touched his lips. \"You're not going to send me to prison,\nI trust?\"\n\n\"I ought to!\" The girl broke into a laugh. \"Why, I can hardly yet\nbelieve that it was really you who were guilty of those things! It\nmortified me, it stunned me--until I realized the truth from the note.\nEven the fact that you did not do it for criminal ends does not relieve\nthe sheer folly of the act. Why did you do it? Come, tell me the truth!\"\n\nGramont shrugged. \"The truth? Well, my chauffeur, Hammond, was the\noriginal Masquer. I caught him in the act--you remember I told you about\nhim? After taking him into my employ, I became the Masquer. Poor Hammond\nwas some time in realizing that my motives were altruistic and not\ncriminal. He was quite distressed about it until he found that I meant\nto return all the loot intact.\"\n\n\"Why did you do it, then?\" persisted the girl.\n\n\"Call it bravado, my dear Lucie. Call it anything you like--I can't lie\nto you! I had a motive, and I refuse to admit what it was; that's all.\"\n\n\"Aren't you ashamed of yourself?\"\n\n\"Not particularly.\" He smiled. \"I had a good end in view, and I\naccomplished it. Also, I flatter myself that I accomplished it very\ndecently; there's nothing like being a good workman, you know. Now that\nI'm all through, now that I've finished playing my little game, you\nhappened to discover it. I am ashamed on that point, Lucie--ashamed\nbecause the discovery has very naturally made you think harshly of\nme----\"\n\n\"I think you've been very silly,\" she said with a disconcerting\ncalmness. He regarded her for a moment, steadily. \"And you have\ndisplayed a fearful lack of judgment!\"\n\n\"Silly? Well--perhaps. What are you going to do with those boxes?\"\n\n\"I'll put them in the mail. I'm going downtown for luncheon, and will do\nit then. They'll be delivered this afternoon.\"\n\nHe nodded. \"I had meant to have them delivered to-morrow; it makes no\ndifference. You're the boss. It will give the good people a little more\nreason for jubilation to-night, eh?\"\n\nA sudden laugh broke upon his lips. \"I'm beginning to see the humour of\nit, Lucie--and I know who put you next to me. It was Jachin Fell, the\nold fox! I suspected that he was on my trail, and I thought that he had\nmanaged the theft of those boxes. In fact, I was preparing to give him a\nbig surprise this afternoon. But tell me, Lucie--are you angry?\"\n\nShe looked at him steadily for a space, then a swift smile leaped to her\nlips and she extended a pardoning hand. Her gesture and words were\nimpulsive, sincere.\n\n\"Angry? No. I think you've some good reason behind it all, which you\nwon't confide to me. I can read you pretty clearly, Henry Gramont; I\nthink I can understand some things in you. You're no weakling, no\nromantic, filibustering crackbrain! And I like you because you won't lie\nto me. You've a motive and you refuse to tell it--very well! I'll be\njust as frank and say that I'm not a bit angry. So, that's settled!\n\n\"Now what was the big surprise that you just mentioned you were going to\ngive poor Mr. Fell this afternoon?\"\n\nGramont's eyes twinkled. \"You remember that I thought he suspected me of\nbeing the Masquer? Well, I was going to him and propose that we enter\nbusiness together.\"\n\n\"Oh! As bandits?\"\n\n\"No, as oil promotors. I'm out of Maillard's company, or shall be out of\nit soon. The minute I'm out, I'll be free to go into business for\nmyself. It occurred to me that if Jachin Fell had brains enough to run\ndown the Midnight Masquer, he would be a mighty good business partner;\nbecause I'm poor on business detail. Also, I think Fell is to be\ntrusted. The things you've told me and written me about him prove that\nmuch. He's very strong politically, I have found--although few people\nknow it.\"\n\n\"But he's not interested in oil is he?\"\n\n\"I don't know; I take for granted that he's interested in making money.\nMost men are. The only way to make money in oil is to have money--and he\nhas some! I have a little. I can put in twenty-five thousand. With an\nequal amount from him, we can sink a couple of wells, perhaps three. If\nwe go broke, all right. If we find oil, we're rich!\"\n\n\"But, my dear Henry, if he knew you to be the Midnight Masquer, do you\nthink he'd want to go into business with you?\" Her gray eyes were\ndancing with amusement as she put the query.\n\n\"Why not?\" Gramont laughed. \"If he knew that I had brains enough to pull\noff that stunt and keep all New Orleans up in the air--wouldn't I make a\ngood partner? Besides, I believe that I have some notion where to go\nafter oil; I'm going to examine your land first----\"\n\n\"My good prince, you surely have no lack of audacity!\" She broke into a\npeal of laughter. \"Your argument about inducing Mr. Fell to go into\nbusiness with you is na\u00c3\u00afve----\"\n\n\"But, as an argument, isn't it quite sound?\"\n\n\"Possibly. Since it is Lucie Ledanois and not Jachin Fell who has\nbrought you to a confession of your crimes against society--aren't you\ngoing to propose that she go into business with you? Doesn't the\nargument hold good with her?\"\n\nAlthough Gramont was taken aback, he met her gaze squarely.\n\n\"No. Oil is no woman's game, unless she can well afford to lose. I\nimagine that you cannot, Lucie. Once I get my company formed,\nhowever----\"\n\n\"You're right, I can't put in any money. I'm land poor. Unless I were to\nsell that Bayou Terrebonne land--it's an old farm, abandoned since\nbefore father died----\"\n\n\"Don't sell it!\" he exclaimed, quickly. \"Don't consider any dealings\nwith it until I have looked it over, will you?\"\n\n\"Since you ask it, no. If there's gas near by, there must be oil.\"\n\n\"Who knows?\" he shrugged. \"No one can predict oil.\"\n\n\"Then you still mean to go to Jachin Fell with your scheme?\"\n\nGramont nodded. \"Yes. See here, Lucie--it's about noon! Suppose you come\nalong and lunch with me at the Louisiane, if you've no engagement. We\ncan put those boxes in the mail en route, and after luncheon I'll try\nand get hold of Fell.\"\n\nShe put her head on one side and studied him reflectively.\n\n\"You're sure you'll not kidnap me or anything like that? It's risky to\nbecome a friend of hardened criminals, even if one is trying to uplift\nthem.\"\n\n\"Good! You'll come?\"\n\n\"If you can give me ten minutes----\"\n\n\"My dear Lucie, you are the most charming object in New Orleans at this\nminute! Why attempt to make yourself still more attractive? Gilding the\nlily is an impossible task.\"\n\n\"Well, wait for me. Is your car here? Good! I want to see Hammond's face\nwhen he sees us carrying out those boxes.\"\n\nLaughing, the girl started toward the stairs. At the doorway she paused.\n\n\"One thing, M. le prince! Do you solemnly promise, upon your honour,\nthat the Midnight Masquer is dead for ever?\"\n\n\"Upon my honour!\" said Gramont, seriously. \"The farce is ended, Lucie.\"\n\n\"All right. I'll be right down. Smoke if you like----\"\n\nIn her own room upstairs Lucie closed the door and sat down before her\ndressing table. She made no move toward the array of toilet articles,\nhowever. Instead, she took a desk telephone from the table, and called a\nnumber. In a moment she received a response.\n\n\"Uncle Jachin!\" she exclaimed. \"Yes--it's just as we thought; it's all a\njoke. No, it was not a joke, either, because he had some motive behind\nit, but he won't tell me what it was. I'm terribly glad that you opened\none of those boxes and found the letter--if you had gone to the police\nit would have been perfectly dreadful----\"\n\n\"I never go to the police,\" said Jachin Fell with his dry chuckle. \"You\nare quite satisfied that there is nothing serious in the affair, then?\"\n\n\"Absolutely! He told me that he had accomplished his purpose, whatever\nit was, and that it's all ended. He just gave me his word that the\nMasquer was dead for ever. Now, aren't you glad that you confided in\nme?\"\n\n\"Very,\" said Jachin Fell. \"Very glad, indeed!\"\n\n\"Now you're laughing at me--never mind! We're going to lunch downtown,\nand we'll mail those boxes on the way, by parcels post. Is that all\nright?\"\n\n\"Quite all right, my dear. It is the method adopted by the most\nexclusive and elusive criminals in the country, I assure you. Every\nhandbag snatcher gets rid of his empty bags by mailing them back to the\nowner--unless first caught. It pays to follow professional examples, as\nEliza said when she crossed the ice. Did your gown come for to-night?\"\n\n\"It's to come this afternoon.\"\n\n\"Very well. Do not plan to wear any jewels, Lucie. I have a set to lend\nyou for the occasion--no, not a gift, merely a loan for the sake of\nComus. They are very nice pearls; a little old fashioned, because they\nwere mounted for the Princesses de Lamballe, but you will find that they\nfit in excellently with your gown. I'll bring them with me when I call\nfor you----\"\n\n\"And I'll tender fitting thanks then. One thing more: Henry Gramont is\ngoing to see you after luncheon, I think--on business. And I want you to\nbe nice to him, Uncle Jachin.\"\n\n\"Most assuredly,\" said the other, drily. \"I should like to be associated\nin business with that young man. The firm would prosper.\"\n\n\"Will you stop laughing at me? Then I'll ring off--good-bye!\"\n\nAnd, smiling, she hung up the receiver.\n\nTen minutes later, when Gramont and Miss Ledanois entered the waiting\ncar, Hammond saw the boxes that they carried. He stood beside the open\ndoor, paralyzed, his eyes fastened on the boxes, his mouth agape.\n\n\"To the postoffice, sergeant,\" said Gramont, then affected to observe\nhis stupefaction. \"Why, what's the matter?\"\n\nHammond met his twinkling eyes, saw the laughter of Lucie, and swallowed\nhard.\n\n\"I--er--nothing at all, cap'n,\" he answered, hoarsely. \"A--a little\nchokin' spell, that's all. Postoffice? Yes, sir.\"\n\n\n\n\n                              CHAPTER VIII\n\n                                _Comus_\n\n\nFrom the time they left the Ledanois house with Lucie, Gramont had no\nopportunity of seeing his chauffeur in private until, later in the\nafternoon, he left the Maison Blanche building. He had enjoyed a\nthoroughly satisfactory interview with Jachin Fell. So wholly had\nGramont's thoughts been given over to the business, indeed, that it was\nalmost a shock to emerge into Canal Street and find everyone else in the\nworld thinking only of the water carnival and the Rex parade.\n\nAs for the Midnight Masquer and the mystery of the boxes of loot, all\nthis had quite fled Gramont's mind before larger and more important\nthings. The car was waiting for him in Royal Street, not far from the\nMonteleone, and Gramont approached it to find Hammond in deep worry over\nthe outcome of the interview with Fell.\n\n\"Well, cap'n!\" he exclaimed, anxiously, as Gramont drew up. \"You're\nsmilin', so I guess it ain't a pinch!\"\n\nGramont laughed gaily. \"Those boxes? Nonsense! Say, sergeant, you must\nhave been scared stiff when you saw them!\"\n\n\"Scared? I was ready to flop, that's all! And how in the name o'\ngoodness did they get in _her_ house? What's behind all this?\"\n\nGramont glanced around. He walked with Hammond to the front of the car,\nwhere he could speak without being overheard by the passersby.\n\n\"It seems that I was more or less mistaken about Fell being on our\ntrail,\" he explained, reflectively. \"We had a very frank talk about it,\nand he disclaimed all knowledge of the boxes themselves. I gathered from\nlittle things he dropped that some criminal had looted the stuff from\nthe car, and that it came to his attention yesterday in a legal\ncapacity----\"\n\n\"Legal capacity, hell!\" snorted Hammond. \"Did you swallow all that?\"\n\n\"My swallowing capacity was pretty good,\" and Gramont chuckled. \"It\nseems that he opened one of the boxes, and found the note I had written.\nThis explained the business, and by way of a little joke he turned over\nthe loot to Miss Ledanois and she had a bit of fun with us. Fell, in\nfact, proved to be a pretty good fellow----\"\n\n\"He sure handed you out a fine line of bull!\" commented Hammond,\nsavagely. \"What gets me is your falling for all that dope! Looks like\nyou wanted to believe him, cap'n.\"\n\n\"Perhaps I did.\" Gramont shrugged his shoulders. \"Why not? I've no\nreason to disbelieve him. The note made it plain that we were not\ncriminals; now the whole affair is cleaned up and out of the way. We're\nout of it in good shape, if you ask me!\"\n\n\"You said something there,\" agreed Hammond, not without a sigh of\nrelief. \"All right, if you say so, only I ain't sure about this\nFell----\"\n\n\"Don't worry. The stuff is returned, and the matter is now closed. We\ncan forget all about the Midnight Masquer. Now, there's another and more\nimportant thing that I want to speak with you about, a matter of\nbusiness----\"\n\n\"Hold on, cap'n!\" interrupted Hammond, quietly, his eye on a spot behind\nGramont. \"One of your friends is headed over this way, and if I know\nanything about it, he's got blood in his eye.\"\n\nGramont turned, to see Bob Maillard approaching. The latter addressed\nhim without any response to his greeting.\n\n\"Have you a moment to spare, Gramont?\"\n\n\"All afternoon,\" answered Gramont, cheerfully. He affected not to\nobserve Maillard's air of heavy business, nor the frowning suspicion\nthat lurked half-veiled in the other's glowering features. \"By the way,\nI've been looking up a New Orleans landmark without much success--the\nRamos gin fizz establishment. It seems to be gone!\"\n\n\"It is,\" returned Maillard, sourly. \"Prohibition killed it, like it's\nkilling everything. Fran\u00c3\u00a7ois moved into the place last September from\nOld 27, and it's become his restaurant now. But look here, Gramont!\" The\ntwo were standing a bit apart, and Hammond was fussing with one of the\nheadlights, but Gramont suspected that the chauffeur was listening\navidly. \"I've just come from a talk with dad. How did it happen that you\nsold him that stock of yours in the company?\"\n\nGramont smiled a little. He was amused by the way Maillard was\nendeavouring to keep down an outburst of angry passion.\n\n\"I happened to need the money. Why?\"\n\n\"But why the devil didn't you hang on to that stock? Or if you needed\nmoney, why didn't you come to me?\" exploded the other, angrily.\n\n\"Heavens!\" drawled Gramont, who was quite willing to exasperate young\nMaillard to the limit. \"You seem frightfully concerned about it! What's\nthe big idea, anyway? I don't recall that any of us went into an\nagreement not to sell if we wanted to. I offered the stock to your\nfather at a discount. He realized that it was a good buy, and took it.\nWhat's wrong with that?\"\n\n\"Nothing wrong, if you put it that way,\" snapped Maillard, angrily. \"But\nit's a confounded sly way of doing things----\"\n\n\"Now, just wait right there!\" Gramont's easy smile vanished. \"I don't\ntake that kind of talk, Maillard. One more such insinuation, and you'll\nneed to use a mask at the ball to-night, I promise you! I'll show you\nhow sly I am, my friend! I'm off in the morning to start work on that\nreport I was engaged to make. When the report comes in, my resignation\ncomes with it.\"\n\n\"All right. Let it come here and now, then.\" Maillard's tone was ugly.\n\"If you're so blamed anxious to get out of the company, get out!\"\n\n\"Thanks. I'll be glad to be relieved of the job.\" Gramont turned and\naddressed his chauffeur. \"Hammond, you'll kindly remember this\nconversation, in case your future testimony is needed----\"\n\n\"Confound you, what d'you mean talking that way?\" broke out Maillard.\n\"Do you suppose I'll deny firing you?\"\n\n\"I don't care to have you offer any reflections on my actions,\nMaillard,\" said Gramont, evenly. \"My course in this matter is perfectly\nopen and above board, which is more than you can say for your doings.\"\n\n\"What?\" Maillard clenched his stick and took a forward step, anger\nworking in his face. \"What the devil d'you mean?\"\n\n\"Exactly what I say--and perhaps I can prove it. Remember the oil\nconcern to which you persuaded your precious father to sell some of Miss\nLedanois's bayou land? Remember the real estate company to which you\npersuaded him to sell her St. Landry parish property? You had interests\nin both concerns; I don't imagine you'd care to have your share in those\ntransactions exposed. Further, I entirely understand your indignation\nover my getting rid of this stock before the crash, and it ill becomes\nyou to assume any such attitude.\"\n\nMaillard glared at him for a long moment, a red tide of rage flooding\nand ebbing from his heavy countenance. Then, mastering himself, he\nturned and strode away without further speech.\n\n\"Hurray!\" observed Hammond, when he was gone. \"Cap'n, that guy is off\nyou for life! I bet he'd like to meet you alone on a dark night!\"\n\nGramont shook his head. \"He's a bad enemy, all right. Here, get into the\ncar!\"\n\nHe climbed in beside Hammond.\n\n\"Don't drive--I want to speak with you. Now that Maillard has relieved\nme of the necessity of making any report to his company, I'm free, and\nglad of it! I've been talking business with Mr. Fell, and I'm to have my\nown company.\"\n\n\"With him?\" Hammond sniffed.\n\n\"Yes. He's matching his money against mine, and we're going to look for\noil on some land owned by Miss Ledanois. It'll be a close corporation,\nand if we strike oil, we'll all three have a good thing. We may go\nbroke, and we may go rich; if you're saving any coin out of your salary\nand feel like taking a gamble, I'll get you a bit of the stock after Mr.\nFell gets things in shape. You can think it over----\"\n\n\"I don't want to think it over,\" broke in Hammond, eagerly. \"I'm on,\nhere and now--and it sure is mighty good of you, cap'n! Say, I ain't had\nany chance to tell you before, but I pulled two hundred out o' the\nlottery last week----\"\n\n\"Lottery!\" Gramont looked at him quickly. \"What lottery?\"\n\nHammond looked a trifle sheepish. \"Well, it's against the law, o'\ncourse, but they run 'em right along just the same. A bunch of the\nchauffeurs here are wise to it; they put up some coin for me last week,\nand as I was sayin' I pulled out two hundred. I got most of it left, and\nhave some saved up on the side. I'll stick it all in, huh?\"\n\nGramont nodded. \"Well, we'll see later. You're free until morning,\nsergeant. I'm going to the Comus ball to-night as a guest of the\nLavergnes, and they'll call for me. Enjoy yourself, keep out of jail,\nand be ready to start at six in the morning for Terrebonne.\"\n\nLeaving Hammond to take the car home, Gramont headed for Canal Street to\nmingle with the carnival crowd and revel in his new-found sense of\nfreedom. Now that he was his own master, he felt like a new man.\n\nOvernight, it seemed, all weights had dropped from his shoulders. On the\nscore of the Midnight Masquer, he was vastly relieved; all that was over\nand forgotten. Financially, he had achieved what was nothing less than a\nmasterly triumph. In a business way, he was free of all ties and able to\nlook forward to decisive action on his own behalf and that of a partner\nin whom he could feel a perfect reliance.\n\nConsequently, he began really to enjoy Mardi Gras for the first time,\nand plunged into the eddying crowds in a free and light-hearted manner\nwhich had not been his for years.\n\nIt was the moment for the carnival spirit to seize on him, and seize him\nit did. With a boyish abandon he tramped the streets merrily, exchanging\njests and confetti, shoves and bladder-blows, laughs and kisses. Madness\nand reckless gaiety were in the very air, and Gramont drank deep of\nthese youthful tonics. When at last he wandered home to his pension, he\nwas footsore, weary, disarranged, and touseled--and very happy. The wine\nof human comradeship is a good wine.\n\nThat evening the Comus ball, the most exclusive revel of the most\nexclusive aristocracy of the southland, crowded the edifice in which it\nwas held to capacity. Here evening dress was prescribed for all the\nguests. The Krewe of Comus alone were masked and costumed, in grotesque\nand magnificent costumes which had been in the making for months. The\nKrewe is to the South what the Bohemian Club is to the western coast,\nwith the added enhancement of mystery.\n\nDespite the revels of the Krewe, however--despite the glittering jewels,\nthe barbaric costumes, the music, the excitement--an indefinable air of\nregret, almost of sadness, pervaded the entire gathering. This feeling\nwas something to be sensed, rather than observed definitely. Some said,\nafterward, that it was a premonition of the terrible event that was to\nhappen this night. Wrong! It was because, for the first time in many\ngenerations, the Comus ball was held in one of the newer public\nbuildings instead of in its accustomed place. Everyone was speaking of\nit. Even Maillard the banker, that cold man of dollars, spoke uneasily\nof it when Gramont encountered him in the smoking room.\n\n\"It doesn't seem like Comus,\" said Maillard, with a vexed frown. \"And to\nthink that we had just finished redecorating the Opera House when it was\nburned down! Comus will never be the same again.\"\n\n\"I didn't know you could feel such emotion for a ruined building,\nMaillard,\" said Gramont, lightly. The banker shrugged a trifle.\n\n\"Emotion? No. Regret! None of us, who has been brought up in the\ntraditions of the city but regarded the French Opera House as the centre\nof all our storied life. You can't understand it, Gramont; no outsider\ncan. By the way, you haven't seen Bob? He's in costume, but he might\nhave spoken to you----\"\n\nGramont answered in the negative, with a slight surprise at the\nquestion.\n\nIt was not long before he came to comprehend more fully just what the\nloss of the old French Opera House meant to the assembly. He heard\ncomparisons made on every hand, regretful allusions, sighs for the days\nthat were no more.\n\nThis present building, to be sure, was one of the city's finest, up to\ndate in every way, with an abundance of room--and yet everyone said that\nComus would never be the same. About the Opera House had clung the\nromance of many generations. About it, too, had clung the affections of\nthe people with a fierceness beyond reason. More famous buildings had\nbeen allowed to go to ruin, like the Hotel Royale, but the Opera House\nhad been kept in repair for Mardi Gras. It was itself--a landmark.\nNothing else would ever be like it.\n\nFrom his seat in the Lavergne box Gramont contented himself during the\nearly evening with the common r\u00c3\u00b4le of all the \"blackcoats\"--that of\nlooking on idly. More than once he saw Lucie Ledanois called out, among\nothers of the fair sex, as a dancing partner for some member of the\nKrewe. None of the male guests, however, was allowed to participate in\nthe festivity until Rex and his queen should arrive--at midnight; thus,\nGramont saw almost nothing of Lucie during the evening.\n\nThere was, inevitably, more or less visiting in boxes and foyers, and\nnot a little lounging in the smoking room. The building was a huge\nstructure, and richly furnished. Only a portion of it was in use by the\nKrewe; the remainder was, of course, deserted for the time being.\n\nWhile in search of smoking companions, Gramont encountered many of his\nacquaintances, and among them Doctor Ansley and Jachin Fell. In order to\nenjoy Fell's proffered El Reys in a somewhat clearer atmosphere these\nthree strolled off together into one of the unused passages leading to\nother parts of the building. They opened a window and stood watching the\ncrowd that surged in the street below, constantly increasing as the hour\ngrew later, for the procession of Rex would be well worth seeing and\nnobody meant to miss anything upon this night of nights.\n\nSuddenly, at the sound of an approaching footstep, the three men turned.\nThe electric lights were going in all of the hallways, and they\nperceived that the individual approaching them was a member of the Krewe\nof Comus. He was also, it became evident, giving a share of his\nallegiance to Bacchus, for his feet were obviously unsteady. He was clad\nin a parti-coloured costume, which was crowned by an exaggerated head of\nMephisto.\n\n\"Good evening to you, worthy gentlemen!\" He came to a fuddled halt and\nstood there, laughing at the stares of the three. \"Evening, I say.\"\n\nThey responded to his liquor-tinged words with a laughing reply.\n\n\"Wonderin' who I am, aren't you!\" he hiccuped. \"Well, don't wonder;\n'sall between ol' friends to-night! Tell you what, m' friends--come with\nme and I'll find you a li'l drink, eh? No prohibition booze, upon m'\nhonour; real old Boone pinchneck--got it from some boys in Louisville,\nbeen savin' it up for to-night.\"\n\nHe wagged his head at them, and pursued his subject in a half-maudlin\nburst of confidential assurance. An unsteady hand waved down the\nhallway.\n\n\"Havin' a little party in one of the rooms,\" he continued. \"All of us\nfriends--lots more fun than dancin'! And say! I'm going pull something\ngreat, positively great; you don't want to miss it, gentlemen! You come\nalong with me and I'll fix it for you. Come on, Gramont, that's a good\nfellow! You'n I had a dis'greement to-day--don't matter to-night,\nnothin' matters to-night, nothin' at all. Mardi Gras only comes once a\nyear, eh? Come along, now.\"\n\nJachin Fell very civilly refused the invitation, as did the others.\nGramont, who now recognized their accoster, was less civil in his\nrefusal. Mephisto sadly wagged his huge headpiece and regarded them with\nvinous regret.\n\n\"No 'joyment in you any more? Better come along. Tell you, I've got the\nbiggest joke of the season ready to pull off--something rich! Gramont,\ncome on!\"\n\n\"Thanks, no,\" responded Gramont, curtly.\n\nThe masquer gave up the struggle and moved on down the empty hallway.\nThe three \"blackcoats\" watched in silence until the grotesque figure had\nvanished.\n\n\"I wonder who that was, now?\" mused Doctor Ansley, frowning. \"Evidently,\nsomeone who knew us; at least, he recognized you, Gramont.\"\n\n\"So it seemed,\" put in Jachin Fell. His tone, like his eyes, held a\nsombre fire. \"A party of them drinking, eh? that will make trouble. The\nKrewe won't like it. Ten to one, that young man and his friends will\nstart the makings of a fine scandal and the Krewe will come down hard on\nthem--mighty hard. Who was he, Gramont? Sounded like----\"\n\n\"Young Maillard.\" At Gramont's response a whistle broke from Doctor\nAnsley. Jachin Fell nodded assent.\n\n\"You took the words out of my mouth. So Bob is drinking again, eh? And\nthey've occupied one of the rooms somewhere, and are enjoying a bit of\nliquor and a card game by themselves. Cursed slippery going, as Eliza\nsaid when she crossed the ice! The Krewe will expel them. Hello,\nGramont--where to?\"\n\nGramont tossed his cigar through the open window.\n\n\"I think I'll make my adieux, Fell. I intend to be up early in the\nmorning and get off to work----\"\n\n\"What?\" protested Ansley in astonishment. \"You must stay until Rex\ncomes, at least! Why, that's the event of the carnival! The evening\nhasn't started yet.\"\n\n\"I'm growing old and sober, doctor,\" and Gramont chuckled. \"To tell the\ntruth,\" and he gave Fell a whimsical glance, \"I am head over ears in\nsome new business matters which have actually fired me with the divine\nafflatus of enthusiasm. What's more, I was drifting with the crowds all\nafternoon, and I've just begun to realize that I'm dead tired. Rex or no\nRex, I'm afraid that I'd best say good-night, gentlemen.\"\n\nGramont persisted in his intention, and bade the other two good-night.\nIn truth, he cared very little about Rex, and a very great deal about\ngetting off to Bayou Terrebonne early in the morning. The oil matter\nfilled his mind. He had formed a thousand plans, he was fired with\nenthusiasm, and was anxious to make his preliminary investigation.\n\nReturning to the auditorium, Gramont sought out his hosts and made his\nfarewells, although not without encountering some opposition. At length\nhe was free, he had obtained his hat and coat, and as he passed out of\nthe building he again met Fell and Ansley, who were finishing their\ncigars at the entrance. He bade them a final adieu and plunged into the\ncrowd.\n\nIt lacked half an hour of midnight. The streets were filled with\nmerrymakers, who were making the night riotous with songs, yells, and\nnoise-producing apparatus, anticipating the arrival of Rex. For a little\nFell and Doctor Ansley stood talking, then tossed away their cigars and\nturned into the building.\n\nThey halted in the foyer before the appearance of two men--Joseph\nMaillard, looking extremely agitated, and behind him old Judge Forester,\nwho wore a distinctly worried expression.\n\n\"Ah, here are Fell and Ansley!\" exclaimed Maillard, almost with relief.\n\"I--ah--my friends, I don't suppose you've seen Bob recently?\"\n\nAnsley was silent. Jachin Fell, however, responded with a cold nod of\nassent.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said in his peculiarly toneless manner. \"Yes, we have. At\nleast, I believe it was he----\"\n\n\"I'm worried,\" said Maillard, anxiously, hurriedly. He made an\nexpressive gesture of despair. \"He's in costume, of course. I've been\ngiven to understand that--well, that he has been--well, drinking.\"\n\n\"He has,\" said Jachin Fell, without any trace of compassion. \"A number\nof the Krewe are occupying one of the rooms in the building, and they\nmust have been visiting it frequently. I trust for your sake that the\nfact hasn't become generally known inside?\"\n\nMaillard nodded. Shame and anger lay heavily in his eyes.\n\n\"Yes, Jachin. I--I was asked to exert my influence over Bob. The request\ncame to me from the floor. This--this is a disgraceful thing to admit,\nmy friends----\"\n\nJudge Forester, in his kindly way, laid his hand on the banker's arm.\n\n\"Tut, tut, Joseph,\" he said, gently, a fund of sympathy in his voice.\n\"Boys will be boys, you know; really, this is no great matter! Don't let\nit hit you so hard. I'll go with you to find the room, of course. Where\nis it, Jachin?\"\n\n\"We'll all go,\" put in Ansley. \"We'll have a little party of our own,\ngentlemen. Come on, I believe we'll be able to discover the place.\"\n\nThe four men left the foyer and started through the corridors. Among\nthem was a tacit understanding, a deep feeling of sympathy for Joseph\nMaillard, a bond which held them to his aid in this disgrace which had\nbefallen him. Jachin Fell, who felt the least compassion or pity, cursed\nBob Maillard--but under his breath.\n\nThey walked through the empty, lighted corridors, following the\ndirection in which Fell and Ansley had seen young Maillard disappear.\n\n\"I hear,\" said Judge Forester to Doctor Ansley, as they followed the\nother two, \"that there has been astonishing news to-day from the\nMidnight Masquer. It seems that a number of people have received back\nproperty this afternoon--loot the bandit had taken. It came by mail,\nspecial delivery. One of the Lavergne boys tells me that they received a\nbox containing everything that was taken at their home, even to cash,\nwith a note asking them to return the things to their guests. It appears\nto have been some sort of a carnival joke, after all.\"\n\n\"A poor one, then,\" responded Ansley, \"and in doubtful taste. I've heard\nnothing of it. I wouldn't mind getting back the little cash I lost,\nthough I must say I'll believe the story when I see the money----\"\n\nHe broke off quickly.\n\nAs they turned a corner of the corridor to the four men came realization\nthat they had attained their goal. From one of the rooms ahead there\nsounded snatches of a boisterous chorus being roared forth lustily. As\nthey halted, to distinguish from which door the singing proceeded, the\nchorus was broken off by an abrupt and sudden silence. This silence was\naccentuated by the preceding noise, as though the singers had checked\ntheir maudlin song in mid-career.\n\n\"Damn it!\" muttered Maillard. \"Did they hear us coming? No, that\nwouldn't matter a hang to them--but what checked them so quickly?\"\n\n\"This door,\" said Fell, indicating one to their right. He paused at it,\nlistening, and over his features came a singular expression. As the\nothers joined him, they caught a low murmur of voices, a hushed sound of\ntalk, a rattle as a number of chips fell from a table.\n\n\"Cursed queer!\" observed Jachin Fell, frowning. \"I wonder what happened\nto them so abruptly? Perhaps the deal was finished--they're having a\ngame. Well, go ahead, Joseph! We'll back you up as a deputation from the\nblackcoats, and if you need any moral support, call on Judge Forester.\"\n\n\"Correct!\" assented that gentleman with dignity. \"I'll give these\njackanapes a little advice! It's going a bit far, this sort of thing; we\ncan't have Comus turned into a common drinking bout. Ready, Joseph?\"\n\nHe flung open the door, and Maillard entered at his side. They then came\nto a startled halt, at view of the scene which greeted them.\n\nThe room was large and well lighted, windows and transom darkened for\nthe occasion. Tobacco smoke made a bluish haze in the air. In the centre\nof the room stood a large table, littered with glasses and bottles, with\nscattered cards, with chips and money.\n\nAbout this table had been sitting half a dozen members of the Krewe of\nComus. Now, however, they were standing, their various identities\ncompletely concealed by the grotesque costumes which cloaked them. Their\nhands were in the air.\n\nStanding at another doorway, midway between their group and that of the\nfour unexpected intruders, was the Midnight Masquer--holding them up at\nthe point of his automatic!\n\nThere was a moment of tense and strained silence, as every eye went to\nthe four men in evening attire. It was plain what had cut short the\nboisterous song--the Masquer must have made his appearance only a moment\nor two previously. From head to foot he was hidden under his leathern\nattire. His unrecognizable features, at this instant, were turned\nslightly toward the four new arrivals. It was obvious that he, no less\nthan the others, was startled by this entry.\n\nMaillard was the first to break that silence of stupefaction.\n\n\"By heavens!\" he cried, furiously. \"Here's that damned villain\nagain--hold him, you! at him, everybody!\"\n\nIn a blind rage, transported out of himself by his sudden access of\npassion, the banker hurled himself forward. From the bandit burst a cry\nof futile warning; the pistol in his hand veered toward his assailant.\n\nThis action precipitated the event. Perhaps because the Masquer did not\nfire instantly, and perhaps because Maillard's mad action shamed them,\nthe nearer members of the drinking party hurled themselves at the\nbandit. The threat of the weapon was forgotten, unheeded in the sweeping\nlust of the man-hunt. It seemed that the fellow feared to fire; and\nabout him closed the party in a surging mass, with a burst of sudden\nshouts, striking and clutching to pull him down and put him under foot.\n\nThen, when it seemed that they had him without a struggle, the Masquer\nbroke from them, swept them apart and threw them off, hurled them clear\naway. He moved as though to leap through the side doorway whence he had\ncome.\n\nWith an oath, Maillard hurled himself forward, struck blindly and\nfuriously at the bandit, and fastened upon him about the waist. There\nwas a surge forward of bodies as the others crowded in to pull down the\nMasquer before he could escape. It looked then as though he were indeed\nlost--until the automatic flamed and roared in his hand, its choking\nfumes bursting at them. The report thundered in the room; a second\nreport thundered, deafeningly, as a second bullet sought its mark.\n\nLike a faint echo to those shots came the slam of a door. The Masquer\nwas gone!\n\nAfter him, into the farther room, rushed some of the party; but he had\nvanished utterly. There was no trace of him. Of course, he might have\nducked into any of the dark rooms, or have run down the corridor, yet\nhis complete disappearance confused the searchers. After a moment,\nhowever, they returned to the lighted room. The Masquer had gone, but\nbehind him had remained a more grim and terrible masquer.\n\nIn the room which he had just left, however, there had fallen a dread\nsilence and consternation. One of the masqued drinkers held an arm that\nhung helpless, dripping blood; but his hurt passed unseen and uncared\nfor, even by himself.\n\nDoctor Ansley was kneeling above a motionless figure, prone on the dirty\nfloor; and it was the figure of Joseph Maillard. The physician glanced\nup, then rose slowly to his feet. He made a terribly significant\ngesture, and his crisp voice broke in upon the appalled silence.\n\n\"Dead,\" he said, curtly. \"Shot twice--each bullet through the heart.\nJudge Forester, I'm afraid there is no alternative but to call in the\npolice. Gentlemen, you will kindly unmask--which one of you is Robert\nMaillard?\"\n\nAmid a stunned and horrified silence the members of the Krewe one by one\nremoved their grotesque headgear, staring at the dead man whose white\nface looked up at them with an air of grim accusation. But none of them\ncame forward to claim kinship with the dead man. Bob Maillard was not in\nthe room.\n\n\"I think,\" said the toneless, even voice of Jachin Fell, \"that all of\nyou gentlemen had better be very careful to say only what you have\nseen--and know. You will kindly remain here until I have summoned the\npolice.\"\n\nHe left the room, and if there were any dark implication hidden in his\nwords, no one seemed to observe it.\n\n\n\n\n                               CHAPTER IX\n\n                             _On The Bayou_\n\n\nAt three o'clock in the morning a great office building is not the most\ndesolate place on earth, perhaps; but it approaches very closely to that\ndefinition.\n\nAt three o'clock on the morning of Ash Wednesday the great white Maison\nBlanche building was deserted and desolate, so far as its offices were\nconcerned. The cleaners and scrub-women had long since finished their\ntasks and departed. Out in the streets the tag-ends of carnival were\nrunning on a swiftly ebbing tide. A single elevator in the building was,\nhowever, in use. A single suite of offices, with carefully drawn blinds,\nwas lighted and occupied.\n\nThey were not ornate, these offices. They consisted of two rooms, a\nsmall reception room and a large private office, both lined to the\nceiling with books, chiefly law books. In the large inner room were\nsitting three men. One of the three, Ben Chacherre, sat in a chair\ntipped back against the wall, his eyes closed. From time to time he\nopened those sparkling black eyes of his, and through narrow-slitted\nlids directed keen glances at the other two men.\n\nOne of the men was the chief of police. The second was Jachin Fell,\nwhose offices these were.\n\n\"Even if things are as you say, which I don't doubt at all,\" said the\nchief, slowly, \"I can't believe the boy did it! And darn it all, if I\npinch him there's goin' to be a hell of a scandal!\"\n\nFell shrugged his shoulders, and made response in his toneless voice:\n\n\"Chief, you're up against facts. Those facts are bound to come out and\nthe newspapers will nail your hide to the wall in a minute. You've a\nbare chance to save yourself by taking in young Maillard at once.\"\n\nThe chief chewed hard on his cigar. \"I don't want to save myself by\nputting the wrong man behind the bars,\" he returned. \"It sure looks like\nhe was the Masquer all the while, but you say that he wasn't. You say\nthis was his only job--a joke that turned out bad.\"\n\n\"Those are the facts,\" said Fell. \"I don't want to accuse a man of\ncrimes I know he did not commit. We have the best of evidence that he\ndid commit this crime. If the newspapers fasten the entire Midnight\nMasquer business on him, as they're sure to do, we can't very well help\nit. I have no sympathy for the boy.\"\n\n\"Of course he did it,\" put in Ben Chacherre, sleepily. \"Wasn't he caught\nwith the goods?\"\n\nThe others paid no heed. The chief indicated two early editions of the\nmorning papers, which lay on the desk in front of Fell. These papers\ncarried full accounts of the return of the Midnight Masquer's loot,\nexplaining his robberies as part of a carnival jest.\n\n\"The later editions, comin' out now,\" said the chief, \"will crowd all\nthat stuff off the front page with the Maillard murder. Darn it, Fell!\nWhether I believe it or not, I'll have to arrest the young fool.\"\n\nChacherre chuckled. Jachin Fell smiled faintly.\n\n\"Nothing could be plainer, chief,\" he responded. \"First, Bob Maillard\ncomes to us in front of the opera house, and talks about a great joke\nthat he's going to spring on his friends across the way----\"\n\n\"How'd you know who he was?\" interjected the chief, shrewdly.\n\n\"Gramont recognized him; Ansley and I confirmed the recognition. He was\nmore or less intoxicated--chiefly more. Now, young Maillard was not in\nthe room at the moment of the murder--unless he was the Masquer. Five\nminutes afterward he was found in a near-by room, hastily changing out\nof an aviator's uniform into his masquerade costume. Obviously, he had\nassumed the guise of the Masquer as a joke on his friends, and the joke\nhad a tragic ending. Further, he was in the aviation service during the\nwar, and so had the uniform ready to hand. You couldn't make anybody\nbelieve that he hasn't been the Masquer all the time!\"\n\n\"Of course,\" and the chief nodded perplexedly. \"It'd be a clear\ncase--only you call me in and say that he _wasn't_ the Masquer! Damn it,\nFell, this thing has my goat!\"\n\n\"What's Maillard's story?\" struck in Ben Chacherre.\n\n\"He denies the whole thing,\" said the worried chief. \"According to his\nstory, which sounded straight the way he tells it, he meant to pull off\nthe joke on his friends and was dressing in the Masquer's costume when\nhe heard the shots. He claims that the shots startled him and made him\nchange back. He swears that he had not entered the other room at all,\nexcept in his masquerade clothes. He says the murderer must have been\nthe real Masquer. It's likely enough, because all young Maillard's crowd\nknew about the party that was to be held in that room during the Comus\nball----\"\n\n\"No matter,\" said Fell, coldly. \"Chief, this is an open and shut case;\nthe boy was bound to lie. That he killed his father was an accident, of\ncourse, but none the less it did take place.\"\n\n\"The boy's a wreck this minute.\" The chief held a match to his unlighted\ncigar. \"But you say that he ain't the original Masquer?\"\n\n\"No!\" Fell spoke quickly. \"The original Masquer was another person, and\nhad nothing to do with the present case. This information is\nconfidential and between ourselves.\"\n\n\"Oh, of course,\" assented the chief. \"Well, I suppose I got to pull\nMaillard, but I hate to do it. I got a hunch that he ain't the right\nparty.\"\n\n\"Virtuous man!\" Fell smiled thinly. \"According to all the books, the\nchief of police is only too glad to fasten the crime on anybody----\"\n\n\"Books be damned!\" snorted the chief, and leaned forward earnestly.\n\"Look here, Fell! Do you believe in your heart that Maillard killed his\nfather?\"\n\nFell was silent a moment under that intent scrutiny.\n\n\"From the evidence, I am forced against my will to believe it,\" he said\nat last. \"Of course, he'll be able to prove that he was not the Masquer\non previous occasions; his alibis will take care of that. Up to the\npoint of the murder, his story is all right. And, my friend, there is a\nchance--a very slim, tenuous chance--that his entire story is true. In\nthat case, another person must have appeared as the Masquer which seems\nunlikely----\"\n\n\"Or else,\" put in Ben Chacherre, smoothly, \"the real original Masquer\nshowed up!\"\n\nThere was an instant of silence. Jachin Fell regarded his henchman with\nsteady gray eyes. Ben Chacherre met the look with almost a trace of\ndefiance. The chief frowned darkly.\n\n\"Yes,\" said the chief. \"That's the size of it, Fell. You're keepin'\nquiet about the name of the real Masquer; why?\"\n\n\"Because,\" said Fell, calmly, \"I happen to know that he was in the\nauditorium at the time of the murder.\"\n\nAgain silence. Ben Chacherre stared at Fell, with amazement and\nadmiration in his gaze. \"When the master lies, he lies magnificently!\"\nhe murmured in French.\n\n\"Well,\" and the chief gestured despairingly, \"I guess that lets out the\nreal Masquer, eh?\"\n\n\"Exactly,\" assented Fell. \"No use dragging his name into it. I'll keep\nat work on this, chief, and if anything turns up to clear young\nMaillard, I'll be very glad.\"\n\n\"All right,\" grunted the chief, and rose. \"I'll be on my way.\"\n\nHe departed. Neither Fell nor Chacherre moved or spoke for a space. When\nat length the clang of the elevator door resounded through the deserted\ncorridors Ben Chacherre slipped from his chair and went to the outer\ndoor. He glanced out into the hall, closed the door, and with a nod\nreturned to his chair.\n\n\"Well?\" Jachin Fell regarded him with intent, searching eyes. \"Have you\nany light to throw on the occasion?\"\n\nChacherre's usual air of cool impudence was never in evidence when he\ntalked with Mr. Fell.\n\n\"No,\" he said, shaking his head. \"Hammond worked on the car until about\nnine o'clock, then beat it to bed, I guess. I quit the job at ten, and\nhis light had been out some time. Well, master, this is a queer affair!\nThere's no doubt that Gramont pulled it, eh?\"\n\n\"You think so?\" asked Fell.\n\nChacherre made a gesture of assent. \"_Quand bois tomb\u00c3\u00a9, cabri\nmont\u00c3\u00a9_--when the tree falls, the kid can climb it! Any fool can see that\nGramont was the man. Don't you think so yourself, master?\"\n\nJachin Fell nodded.\n\n\"Yes. But we've no evidence--everything lies against young Maillard.\nEarly in the morning Gramont goes to Paradis to examine that land of\nMiss Ledanois' along the bayou. He'll probably say nothing of this\nmurder to Hammond, and the chauffeur may not find out about it until a\nday or two--they get few newspapers down there.\n\n\"Drive down to Paradis in the morning, Ben; get into touch with Hammond,\nand discover what time Gramont got home to-night. Write me what you find\nout. Then take charge of things at the Gumberts place. Make sure that\nevery car is handled right. A headquarters man from Mobile will be here\nto-morrow to trace the Nonpareil Twelve that Gramont now owns.\"\n\nChacherre whistled under his breath. \"What?\"\n\nJachin Fell smiled slightly and nodded. \"Yes. If Gramont remains at\nParadis, I may send him on down there--I'm not sure yet. I intend to get\nsomething on that man Hammond.\"\n\n\"But you can't land him that way, master! He bought the car----\"\n\n\"And who sold the car to the garage people? They bought it innocently.\"\nA peculiar smile twisted Fell's lips awry. \"In fact, they bought it from\na man named Hammond, as the evidence will show very clearly.\"\n\nBen Chacherre started, since he had sold that car himself. Then a slow\ngrin came into his thin features--a grin that widened into a noiseless\nlaugh.\n\n\"Master, you are magnificent!\" he said, and rose. \"Well, if there is\nnothing further on hand, I shall go to bed.\"\n\n\"An excellent programme,\" said Jachin Fell, and took his hat from the\ndesk. \"I must get some sleep myself.\"\n\nThey left the office and the building together.\n\nThree hours afterward the dawn had set in--a cold, gray, and dismal dawn\nthat rose upon a city littered with the aftermath of carnival. \"Lean\nWednesday\" it was, in sober fact. Thus far, the city in general was\nignorant of the tragedy which had taken place at the very conclusion of\nits gayest carnival season. Within a few hours business and social\ncircles would be swept by the fact of Joseph Maillard's murder, but at\nthis early point of the day the city slept. The morning papers, which\nto-day carried a news story that promised to shock and stun the entire\ncommunity, were not yet distributed.\n\nRising before daylight, Henry Gramont and Hammond breakfasted early and\nwere off by six in the car. They were well outside town and sweeping on\ntheir way to Terrebonne Parish and the town of Paradis before they\nrealized that the day was not going to brighten appreciably. Instead, it\nremained very cloudy and gloomy, with a chill threat of rain in the air.\n\nWeather mattered little to Gramont. When finally the excellent highway\nwas left behind, and they started on the last lap of their seventy-mile\nride, they found the parish roads execrable and the going slow. Thus,\nnoon was at hand when they at length pulled into Paradis, the town\nclosest to Lucie Ledanois' bayou land. The rain was still holding off.\n\n\"Too cold to rain,\" observed Gramont. \"Let's hit for the hotel and get\nsomething to eat. I'll have to locate the land, which is somewhere near\ntown.\"\n\nThey discovered the hotel to be an ancient structure, and boasting\nprices worthy of Lafitte and his buccaneers. As in many small towns of\nLouisiana, however, the food proved fit for a king. After a light\nluncheon of quail, crayfish bisque, and probably illegal venison,\nGramont sighed regret that he could eat no more, and set about inquiring\nwhere the Ledanois farm lay.\n\nThere was very little, indeed, to Paradis, which lay on the bayou but\nwell away from the railroad. It was a desolate spot, unpainted and\nunkept. The parish seat of Houma had robbed it of all life and growth on\nthe one hand; on the other, the new oil and gas district had not yet\ntouched it.\n\nSouthward lay the swamp--fully forty miles of it, merging by degrees\ninto the Gulf. Forty miles of cypress marsh and winding bayou,\nuncharted, unexplored save by occasional hunters or semi-occasional\nsheriffs. No man knew who or what might be in those swamps, and no one\ncared to know. The man who brought in fish or oysters in his skiff might\nbe a bayou fisherman, and he might be a murderer wanted in ten states.\nCuriosity was apt to prove extremely unhealthy. Like the Atchafalaya,\nwhere chance travellers find themselves abruptly ordered elsewhere, the\nTerrebonne swamps have their own secrets and know how to keep them.\n\nGramont had no difficulty in locating the Ledanois land, and he found\nthat it was by no means in the swamp. A part of it, lying closer to\nHouma, had been sold and was now included in the new oil district; it\nwas this portion which Joseph Maillard had sold off.\n\nThe remainder, and the largest portion, lay north of Paradis and ran\nalong the west bank of the bayou for half a mile. A long-abandoned farm,\nit was high ground, with the timber well cleared off and excellently\nlocated; but tenants were hard to get and shiftless when obtained, so\nthat the place had not been farmed for the last five years or more.\nAfter getting these facts, Gramont consulted with Hammond.\n\n\"We'd better buy some grub here in town and arrange to stay a couple of\nnights on the farm, if necessary,\" he said. \"There are some buildings\nthere, so we'll find shelter. Along the bayou are summer cottages--I\nbelieve some of them are rather pretentious places--and we ought to find\nthe road pretty decent. It's only three or four miles out of town.\"\n\nWith some provisions piled in the car, they set forth. The road wound\nalong the bayou side, past ancient 'Cajun farms and the squat homes of\nfishermen. Here and there had been placed camps and summer cottages,\nnestling amid groups of huge oaks and cypress, whose fronds of\nsilver-gray moss hung in drooping clusters like pale and ghostly\nshrouds.\n\nWatching the road closely, Gramont suddenly found the landmarks that had\nbeen described to him, and ordered Hammond to stop and turn in at a gap\nin the fence which had once been an entrance gate.\n\n\"Here we are! Those are the buildings off to the right. Whew! I should\nsay it had been abandoned! Nothing much left but ruins. Go ahead!\"\n\nBefore them, as they drove in from the road by a grass-covered drive,\nshowed a house, shed, and barn amid a cluster of towering trees. Indeed,\ntrees were everywhere about the farm, which had grown up in a regular\nsapling forest. The buildings were in a ruinous state--clapboards\nhanging loosely, roofs dotted by gaping holes, doors and windows long\nsince gone.\n\nLeaving the car, Gramont, followed by the chauffeur, went to the front\ndoorway and surveyed the wreckage inside.\n\n\"What do you say, Hammond? Think we can stop here, or go back to the\nhotel? It's not much of a run to town----\"\n\nHammond pointed to a wide fireplace facing them.\n\n\"I can get this shack cleaned out in about half an hour--this one room,\nanyhow. When we get a fire goin' in there, and board up the windows and\ndoors, we ought to be comfortable enough. But suit yourself, cap'n! It's\nyour funeral.\"\n\nGramont laughed. \"All right. Go ahead and clean up, then, and if rain\ncomes down we can camp here. Be sure and look for snakes and vermin. The\nfloor seems sound, and if there's plenty of moss on the trees, we can\nmake up comfortable beds. Too bad you're not a fisherman, or we might\nget a fresh fish out of the bayou----\"\n\n\"I got some tackle in town,\" and Hammond grinned widely.\n\n\"Good work! Then make yourself at home and go to it. We've most of the\nafternoon before us.\"\n\nGramont left the house, and headed down toward the bayou shore.\n\nHe took a letter from his pocket, opened it, and glanced over it anew.\nIt was an old letter, one written him nearly two years previously by\nLucie Ledanois. It had been written merely in the endeavour to distract\nthe thoughts of a wounded soldier, to bring his mind to Louisiana, away\nfrom the stricken fields of France. In the letter Lucie had described\nsome of the more interesting features of Bayou Terrebonne--the oyster\nand shrimp fleets, the Chinese and Filipino villages along the Gulf, the\nfar-spread cypress swamps; the bubbling fountains, natural curiosities,\nthat broke up through the streams and bayous of the whole wide\nparish--fountains that were caused by gas seeping up from the earth's\ninterior, and breaking through.\n\nGramont knew that plans were already afoot to tap this field of natural\ngas and pipe it to New Orleans. Oil had been found, too, and all the\nstate was now oil-mad. Fortunes were being made daily, and other\nfortunes were being lost daily by those who dealt with oil-stocks\ninstead of with oil.\n\n\"Those gas-fountains did the work!\" reflected Gramont. \"And according to\nthis letter, there's one of those fountains here in the bayou, close to\nher property. 'Just opposite the dock,' she says. The first thing is to\nfind the dock, then the fountain. After that, we'll decide if it's true\nmineral gas. If it is, then the work's done--for I'll sure take a chance\non finding oil near it!\"\n\nGramont came to the bayou and began searching his way along the thick\nand high fringe of bushes and saplings that girded the water's edge.\nPresently he came upon the ruined evidences of what had once been a\nsmall boat shed. Not far from this he found the dock referred to in the\nletter; nothing was left of it except a few spiles protruding from the\nsurface of the water. But he had no need to look farther. Directly\nbefore him, he saw that which he was seeking.\n\nA dozen feet out from shore the water was rising and falling in a\ncontinuous dome or fountain of highly charged bubbles that rose a foot\nabove the surface. Gramont stared at it, motionless. He watched it for a\nspace--then, abruptly, he started. It was a violent start, a start of\nsheer amazement and incredulity.\n\nHe leaned forward, staring no longer at the gas dome, but at the water\ncloser inshore. For a moment he thought that his senses had deceived\nhim, then he saw that the thing was there indeed, there beyond any\ndoubt--a very faint trace of iridescent light that played over the\nsurface of the water.\n\n\"It can't be possible!\" he muttered, bending farther over. \"Such a thing\nhappens too rarely----\"\n\nHis heart pounded violently; excitement sent the blood rushing to his\nbrain in blinding swirls. He was gripped by the gold fever that comes\nupon a man when he makes the astounding discovery of untold wealth lying\nat his feet, passed over and disregarded by other and less-discerning\nmen for days and years!\n\nIt was oil, no question about it. An extremely slight quantity, true; so\nslight a quantity that there was no film on the water, no discernible\ntaste to the water. Gramont brought it to his mouth and rose, shaking\nhis head.\n\nWhere did it come from? It had no connection with the gas bubbles--at\nleast, it did not come from the dome of water and gas. How long he stood\nthere staring Gramont did not know. His brain was afire with the\npossibilities. At length he stirred into action and started up the bayou\nbank, from time to time halting to search the water below him, to make\nsure that he could still discern the faint iridescence.\n\nHe followed it rod by rod, and found that it rapidly increased in\nstrength. It must come from some very tiny surface seepage close at\nhand, that was lost in the bayou almost as rapidly as it came from the\nearth-depths. Only accidentally would a man see it--not unless he were\nsearching the water close to the bank, and even then only by the grace\nof chance.\n\nSuddenly Gramont saw that he had lost the sign. He halted.\n\nNo, not lost, either! Just ahead of him was a patch of reeds, and a\nrecession of the shore. He advanced again. Inside the reeds he found the\noily smear, still so faint that he could only detect it at certain\nangles. Glancing up, he could see a fence at a little distance,\nevidently the boundary fence of the Ledanois land; the bushes and trees\nthinned out here, and on ahead was cleared ground. He saw, through the\nbushes, glimpses of buildings.\n\nViolent disappointment seized him. Was he to lose this discovery, after\nall? Was he to find that the seepage came from ground belonging to\nsomeone else? No--he stepped back hastily, barely in time to avoid\nstumbling into a tiny trickle of water, a rivulet that ran down into the\nbayou, a tributary so insignificant that it was invisible ten feet\ndistant! And on the surface a faint iridescence.\n\nExcitement rising anew within him, Gramont turned and followed this\nrivulet, his eyes aflame with eagerness. It led him for twenty feet, and\nceased abruptly, in a bubbling spring that welled from a patch of low,\ntree-enclosed land. Gramont felt his feet sinking in grass, and saw that\nthere was a dip in the ground hereabouts, a swampy little section all to\nitself. He picked a dry spot and lay down on his face, searching the\nwater with his eyes.\n\nMoment after moment he lay there, watching. Presently he found the\nslight trickle of oil again--a trickle so faint and slim that even here,\non the surface of the tiny rivulet, it could be discerned only with\ngreat difficulty. A very thin seepage, concluded Gramont; a thin oil, of\ncourse. So faint a little thing, to mean so much!\n\nIt came from the Ledanois land, no doubt of it. What did that matter,\nthough? His eyes widened with flaming thoughts as he gazed down at the\nslender thread of water. No matter at all where this came from--the main\npoint was proven by it! There was oil here for the finding, oil down in\nthe thousands of feet below, oil so thick and abundant that it forced\nitself up through the earth fissures to find an outlet!\n\n\"Instead of going down five or six thousand feet,\" he thought,\nexultantly, \"we may have to go down only as many hundred. But first we\nmust get an option or a lease on all the land roundabout--all we can\nsecure! There will be a tremendous boom the minute this news breaks. If\nwe get those options, we can sell them over again at a million per cent.\nprofit, and even if we don't strike oil in paying quantities, we'll\nregain the cost of our drilling! And to think of the years this has been\nhere, waiting for someone----\"\n\nSuddenly he started violently. An abrupt crashing of feet among the\nbushes, an outbreak of voices, had sounded not far away--just the other\nside of the boundary fence. He was wakened from his dreams, and started\nto rise. Then he relaxed his muscles and lay quiet, astonishment seizing\nhim; for he heard his own name mentioned in a voice that was strange to\nhim.\n\n\n\n\n                               CHAPTER X\n\n                                _Murder_\n\n\nThe voice was strange to Gramont, yet he had a vague recollection of\nhaving at some time heard it before. It was a jaunty and impudent voice,\nvery self-assured--yet it bore a startled and uneasy note, as though the\nspeaker had just come unaware upon the man whom he addressed.\n\n\"Howdy, sheriff!\" it said. \"Didn't see you in there--what you doin' so\nfar away from Houma, eh?\"\n\n\"Why, I've been looking over the place around here,\" responded another\nvoice, which was dry and grim. \"I know you, Ben Chacherre, and I think\nI'll take you along with me. Just come from New Orleans, did you?\"\n\n\"Me? Take _me_?\" The voice of Chacherre shrilled up suddenly in alarm.\n\"Look here, sheriff, it wasn't me done it! It was Gramont----\"\n\nThere came silence. Not a sound broke the stillness of the late\nafternoon.\n\nGramont, listening, lay bewildered and breathless. Ben Chacherre, the\nsneak thief--how had Chacherre come here? Gramont knew nothing of any\ntie between Jachin Fell and Chacherre; he could only lie in the grass\nand wonder at the man's presence. What \"place\" was it that the sheriff\nof Houma had been looking over? And what was it that he, Gramont, was\nsupposed to have done?\n\nConfused and wondering, Gramont waited. And, as he waited, he caught a\nsoft sound from the marshy ground beside him--a faint \"plop\" as though\nsome object had fallen close by on the wet grass. At the moment he paid\nno heed to this sound, for again the uncanny silence had fallen.\n\nListening, Gramont fancied that he caught slow, stealthy footsteps amid\nthe undergrowth, but derided the fancy as sheer imagination. His brain\nwas busy with this new problem. Houma, he knew, was the seat of the\nparish or county. This Ben Chacherre appeared to have suddenly and\nunexpectedly encountered the sheriff, to his obvious alarm, and the\nsheriff had for some reason decided to arrest him; so much was clear.\n\nChacherre had something to do with the \"place\"--did that mean the\nadjacent property, or the Ledanois farm? In his puzzled bewilderment\nover this imbroglio Gramont for the moment quite forgot the trickle of\noil at his feet.\n\nBut now the deep silence became unnatural and sinister. What had\nhappened? Surely, Ben Chacherre had not been arrested and taken away in\nsuch silence! Why had the voices so abruptly ceased? Vaguely uneasy,\nstartled by the prolongation of that intense stillness, Gramont rose to\nhis feet and peered among the trees.\n\nThe two speakers seemed to have departed; he could descry nobody in\nsight. A step to one side gave Gramont a view of the land adjoining the\nLedanois place. This was cleared of all brush, and under some immense\noaks to the far left he had a glimpse of a large summer cottage, boarded\nup and apparently deserted. Nearer at hand, however, he saw other\nbuildings, and these drew his attention. He heard the throbbing pound of\na motor at work, and as there was no power line along here, the place\nevidently had its own electrical plant. He scrutinized the scene before\nhim appraisingly.\n\nThere were two large buildings here. One seemed to be a large barn,\nclosed, the other was a long, low shed which was too large to be a\ngarage. The door of this was open, and before the opening Gramont saw\nthree men standing in talk; he recognized none of them. Two of the\ntalkers were clad in greasy overalls, and the third figure showed the\nflash of a collar. The sheriff, Ben Chacherre, and some other man,\nthought Gramont. He would not have known Chacherre had he encountered\nhim face to face. To him, the man was a name only.\n\nThe mention of his own name by Chacherre impelled him to go forward and\ndemand some explanation. Then it occurred to him that perhaps he had\nmade a mistake; it would have been very easy, for he was not certain\nthat Chacherre had referred to him. There could be other Gramonts, or\nother men whose name would have much the same sound in a Creole mouth.\n\n\"I'd better attend to my own business,\" thought Gramont, and turned\naway. He noticed that the motor had ceased its work. \"Wonder what rich\nchap can be down here at his summer cottage this time of year? May be\nonly a caretaker, though. I'd better give all my attention to this oil,\nand let other things alone.\"\n\nHe retraced his steps to the bayou bank and turned back toward the\nhouse. As he did so, Hammond appeared coming toward him, knife in hand.\n\n\"I'm going to cut me a pole and land a couple o' fish for supper,\"\nannounced the chauffeur, grinning. \"Got things cleaned up fine, cap'n!\nYou won't know the old shack.\"\n\n\"Good enough,\" said Gramont. \"Here, step over this way! I want to show\nyou something.\"\n\nHe led Hammond to the rivulet and pointed out the thin film of oil on\nthe surface.\n\n\"There's our golden fortune, sergeant! Oil actually coming out of the\nground! It doesn't happen very often, but it does happen--and this is\none of the times. I'll not bother to look around any farther.\"\n\n\"Glory be!\" said Hammond, staring at the rivulet. \"Want to hit back for\ntown?\"\n\n\"No; we couldn't get back until sometime to-night, and the roads aren't\nvery good for night work. I'm going to get some leases around\nhere--perhaps I can do it right away, and we'll start back in the\nmorning. Go ahead and get your fish.\"\n\nRegaining the house, he saw that Hammond had indeed cleaned up in great\nstyle, and had the main room looking clean as a pin, with a fire popping\non the hearth. He did not pause here, but went to the car, got in, and\nstarted it. He drove back to the road, and followed this toward town for\na few rods, turning in at a large and very decent-looking farmhouse that\nhe had observed while passing it on the way out.\n\nHe found the owner, an intelligent-appearing Creole, driving in some\ncows for milking, and was a little startled to realize that the\nafternoon was so late. When he addressed the farmer in French, he\nreceived a cordial reply, and discovered that this man owned the land\nacross the road from the Ledanois place--that his farm, in fact, covered\nseveral hundred acres.\n\n\"Who owns the land next to the Ledanois place?\" inquired Gramont.\n\n\"I sold that off my land a couple of years ago,\" replied the other. \"A\nman from New Orleans wanted it for a summer place--a business man there,\nIsidore Gumberts.\"\n\nGumberts--\"Memphis Izzy\" Gumberts! The name flashed to Gramont's mind,\nand brought the recollection of a conversation with Hammond. Why,\nGumberts was the famous crook of whom Hammond had spoken.\n\n\"I saw the sheriff awhile ago, heading up the road,\" observed the\nCreole. \"Did you meet him?\"\n\nGramont shook his head. \"No, but I saw several men at the Gumberts\nplace. Perhaps he was there----\"\n\n\"Not there, I guess,\" and the farmer laughed. \"Those fellows have rented\nthe place from Gumberts, I hear; they're inventors, and quiet enough\nmen. You're a stranger here?\"\n\nGramont introduced himself as a friend of Miss Ledanois, and stated\nfrankly that he was looking for oil and hoped to drill on her land.\n\n\"I'd like a lease option from you,\" he went on. \"I don't want to buy\nyour land at all; what I want is a right to drill for oil on it, in case\nany shows up on Miss Ledanois' land. It's all a gamble, you know. I'll\ngive you a hundred dollars for the lease, and the usual eighth interest\nin any oil that's found. I've no lease blanks with me, but if you'll\ngive me the option, a signed memorandum will be entirely sufficient.\"\n\nThe farmer regarded oil as a joke, and said so. The hundred dollars,\nhowever, and the prospective eighth interest, were sufficient to induce\nhim to part with the option without any delay. He was only too glad to\nget the thing done with at once, and to pocket Gramont's money.\n\nGramont drove away, and was just coming to the Ledanois drive when he\nsuddenly threw on the brakes and halted the car, listening. From\nsomewhere ahead of him--the Gumberts place, he thought instantly--echoed\na shot, and several faint shouts. Then silence again.\n\nGramont paused, indecisive. The sheriff was making an arrest, he\nthought. A hundred possibilities flitted through his brain, suggested by\nthe sinister combination of Memphis Izzy, known even to Hammond as a\nprince among crooks, with this secluded place leased by \"inventors.\"\nBootlegging? Counterfeiting?\n\nAs he paused, thus, he suddenly started; he was certain that he had\ncaught the tones of Hammond, as though in a sudden uplifted oath of\nanger. Gramont threw in his clutch and sent the car jumping forward--he\nremembered that he had left Hammond beside the rivulet, close to the\nGumberts property. What had happened?\n\nHe came, after a moment of impatience, to an open gate whose drive led\nto the Gumberts place. Before him, as he turned in, unfolded a startling\nscene. Three men, the same three whom he had seen from the bushes, were\nstanding in front of the low shed; two of them held rifles, the third,\none of the \"inventors\" in overalls, was winding a bandage about a\nbleeding hand. The two rifles were loosely levelled at Hammond, who\nstood in the centre of the group with his arms in the air.\n\nWhatever had happened, Hammond had evidently not been easily captured.\nHis countenance was somewhat battered, and the one captor who wore a\ncollar was bleeding copiously from a cut cheek. The three turned as\nGramont's car drove up, and Hammond gave an ejaculation of relief.\n\n\"Here he is now----\"\n\n\"Shut up!\" snapped one of his armed captors in an ugly tone. \"Hurry up,\nChacherre--get a rope and tie this gink!\"\n\nGramont leaped from the car and strode forward.\n\n\"What's been going on here?\" he demanded, sharply. \"Hammond----\"\n\n\"I found a dead man over in them bushes,\" shot out Hammond, \"and these\nguys jumped me before I seen 'em. They claim I done it----\"\n\n\"A dead man!\" repeated Gramont, and looked at the three. \"What do you\nmean?\"\n\n\"Give him the spiel, Chacherre,\" growled one of them. Ben Chacherre\nstepped forward, his bold eyes fastened on those of Gramont with a look\nof defiance.\n\n\"The sheriff was here some time ago, looking for a stolen boat,\" he\nsaid, \"and went off toward the Ledanois place. We were following, in\norder to help him search, when we came upon this man standing in the\nbushes, over the body of the sheriff. A knife was in his hand, and the\nsheriff had been stabbed to death. He drew a pistol and shot one of\nus----\"\n\nGramont was staggered for a moment. \"Wait!\" he exclaimed. \"Hammond, how\nmuch of this is true?\"\n\n\"What I'm tellin' you, cap'n,\" answered Hammond, doggedly. \"I found a\nman layin' there and was looking at him when these guys jumped me. I\nshot that fellow in the arm, all right, then they grabbed my gun and got\nme down. That's all.\"\n\nThe sheriff--murdered!\n\nInto the mind of Gramont leaped that brief conversation which he had\noverheard between Ben Chacherre and the sheriff; the strange, unnatural\nsilence which had concluded that broken-off conversation. He stared from\nHammond to the others, speechless for the moment, yet with hot words\nrising impetuously in him.\n\nNow he noticed that Chacherre and his two companions were watching him\nvery intently, and were slightly circling out. He sensed an acquaintance\namong all these men. He saw that the wounded man had finished his\nbandaging, and was now holding his unwounded hand in his jacket pocket,\nbulkily, menacingly.\n\nDanger flashed upon Gramont--flashed upon him vividly and with startling\nclearness. He realized that anything was possible in this isolated\nspot--this spot where murder had so lately been consummated! He checked\non his very lips what he had been about to blurt forth; at this instant,\nHammond voiced the thought in his mind.\n\n\"It's a frame-up!\" said the chauffeur, angrily.\n\n\"That's likely, isn't it?\" Chacherre flung the words in a sneer, but\nwith a covert glance at Gramont. \"This fellow is your chauffeur, ain't\nhe? Well, we got to take him in to Houma, that's all.\"\n\n\"Where's the sheriff's body?\" demanded Gramont, quietly.\n\n\"Over there,\" Chacherre gestured. \"We ain't had a chance to bring him\nback yet--this fellow kept us busy. Maybe you want to frame up an alibi\nfor him?\"\n\nGramont paid no attention to the sneering tone of this last. He regarded\nChacherre fixedly, thinking hard, keeping himself well in hand.\n\n\"You say the sheriff was here, then went over toward the Ledanois land?\"\nhe asked. \"Did he go alone, or were you with him?\"\n\n\"We were fixin' to follow him,\" asserted Chacherre, confidently. This\nwas all Gramont wanted to know--that the man was lying. \"We were\ntrailin' along after him when he stepped into the bushes. This man of\nyours was standing over him with a knife----\"\n\n\"I was, too, when they found me--I was cuttin' me a fishpole,\" said\nHammond, sulkily. He was plainly beginning to be impressed and alarmed\nby the evidence against him. Gramont only nodded.\n\n\"No one saw the actual murder, then?\"\n\n\"No need for it,\" said Chacherre, brazenly. \"When we found him that way!\nEh?\"\n\n\"I suppose not,\" answered Gramont, his eyes fastened thoughtfully on\nHammond. The latter caught the look, let his jaw fall in astonishment,\nthen flushed and compressed his lips--and waited. Gramont glanced at\nChacherre, and launched a chance shaft.\n\n\"You're Ben Chacherre, aren't you? Do you work for Mr. Fell?\"\n\nThe chance shot scored. \"Yes,\" said Chacherre, his eyes narrowing.\n\n\"What are you doing here, then?\"\n\nFor an instant Chacherre was off guard. He did not know how much--or\nlittle--Gramont knew; but he did know that Gramont was aware who had\ntaken the loot of the Midnight Masquer from the luggage compartment of\nthe car. This knowledge, very naturally, threw him back on the defence\nof which he was most sure.\n\n\"I came on an errand for my master,\" he said, and with those words gave\nthe game into Gramont's hands.\n\nThere was a moment of silence. Gramont stood apparently in musing\nthought, conscious that every eye was fastened upon him, and that one\nfalse move would now spell disaster. He gave no sign of the tremendous\nshock that Chacherre's words had just given him; when he spoke, it was\nquietly and coolly:\n\n\"Then your master is evidently associated with Memphis Izzy Gumberts,\nwho owns this place here. Is that right?\"\n\nBoth Hammond and Chacherre's two friends started at this.\n\n\"I don't know anything about that,\" returned Chacherre, with a shrug\nwhich did not entirely conceal his uneasiness. \"I know that we've got a\nmurderer here, and that we'll have to dispose of him. Do you object?\"\n\n\"Of course not,\" said Gramont, calmly. \"Step aside and give me a moment\nin private with Hammond. Then by all means take him in to Houma. I'd\nsuggest that you tie him up, or make use of handcuffs if the sheriff\nbrought any along. Then you'd better take in the body of the sheriff\nalso. Hammond, a word with you!\"\n\nThis totally unexpected acquiescence on the part of Gramont seemed to\nstun Chacherre into inaction. He half moved, as though uncertain whether\nto bar Gramont from the prisoner, then he stepped aside as Gramont\nadvanced. A gesture to his two companions prevented them from\ninterfering.\n\n\"Keep 'em covered, though,\" he said, shifting his own rifle slightly and\nwatching with a scowl of suspicion.\n\nGramont ignored him and went up to Hammond, with a look of warning.\n\n\"You'll have to submit to this, old man,\" he said, in a tone that the\nothers could not overhear. \"Don't dream that I'm deserting you; but I\nwant a good look at this place if all three of them go away. They must\nnot suspect----\"\n\n\"Cap'n, look out!\" broke in Hammond, urgently. \"This here is a gang--the\nwhole thing is a frame-up on me!\"\n\n\"I know it--I was present when the sheriff was murdered; but keep quiet.\nI'll come to Houma later to-night and see you.\" He turned away with a\nshrug as though Hammond had denied him some favour, and lifted his\nvoice. \"Chacherre! How are you to take this man into town? How did you\nget here? Will you need to use my car?\"\n\n\"No.\" The Creole jerked his head toward the barn. \"I came in Mr. Fell's\ncar--it's got a sprung axle and is laid up. We'll take him back in\nanother one.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" Gramont paused and glanced around. \"This is a terrible\nblow, men. I never dreamed that Hammond was a murderer or could be one!\nYou don't know of any motive for the crime?\"\n\nThey shook their heads, but suspicion was dying from their eyes. Gramont\nglanced again at his chauffeur.\n\n\"I'll not abandon you, Hammond,\" he said, severely, coldly. \"I'll stop\nin at Houma and see that you have a lawyer. I think, gentlemen, we had\nbetter attend to bringing in the body of the sheriff, eh?\"\n\nThe wounded man dodged into the barn and returned with a strip of rope.\nChacherre took this, and firmly bound Hammond's arms, then forced him to\nsit down and bound his ankles.\n\n\"You watch him,\" he ordered the wounded member of the trio. \"We'll get\nthe sheriff.\"\n\nAllowing Chacherre and his companion to take the lead, Gramont went with\nthem to the place where the murdered officer lay. As he went, the\nconviction grew more sure within him that, when he lay there by the\nrivulet, he had actually heard the last words uttered by the sheriff;\nthat Chacherre had committed the murder in that moment--a noiseless,\ndeadly stab! That Hammond could or would have done it he knew was\nabsurd.\n\nThey found the murdered man lying among the bushes. He had been stabbed\nunder the fifth rib--the knife had gone direct to the heart. Chacherre\nannounced that he had Hammond's knife as evidence and Gramont merely\nnodded his head.\n\nLifting the body between them, they bore it back to the barn.\n\n\"Now,\" said Gramont, quickly, \"I'm off for Houma--if I don't miss my\nroad! You men will be right along?\"\n\n\"In a jiffy,\" said Chacherre, promptly.\n\nGramont climbed into his car and drove away. He had no fear of anything\nhappening to Hammond; the evidence against the latter was damning, and\nwith three men to swear him into a hangman's noose, they would bring him\nto jail safe enough.\n\n\"A clever devil, that Chacherre!\" he thought, grimly. \"We're up against\na gang, beyond any doubt. Now, if they don't suspect me----\"\n\nHe turned in at the Ledanois gate, knowing himself to be beyond sight or\nhearing of the Gumberts place. He drove the car away from the house, and\ninto the thick of the densest bush-growth that he could find where it\nwas well concealed from sight. Then, on foot, he made his way along the\nbank of the bayou until he had come to the rivulet where oil showed.\n\nHere he paused, concealing himself and gaining a place where he could\nget a view of the Gumberts land. He saw Chacherre and Hammond there,\nbeside the body of the sheriff; the other two men were swinging open the\nbarn door. They disappeared inside, and a moment later Gramont heard the\nwhirr of an engine starting. A car backed out into the yard--a\nseven-passenger Cadillac--and halted.\n\nThe three men lifted the body of the sheriff, into the tonneau.\nChacherre took the wheel, Hammond being bundled in beside him. The other\ntwo men climbed in beside the body, rifles in hand. Chacherre started\nthe car toward the road.\n\n\"All fine!\" thought Gramont with a thrill of exultation. \"They've all\ncleared out and left the place to me--and I want a look at that place.\"\n\nSuddenly, as he stood there, he remembered the slight \"plump\" that he\nhad heard during that interminable silence which had followed the\nconversation between the sheriff and Ben Chacherre. It was a sound as\nthough something had fallen near him in the soggy ground.\n\nThe remembrance startled him strangely. He visualized an excited\nmurderer standing beside his victim, knife in hand; he visualized the\nabhorrence which must have seized the man for a moment--the abhorrence\nwhich must have caused him to do something in that moment which in a\ncooler time he would not have done.\n\nGramont turned toward the little marshy spot where he had lain\nlistening. He bent down, searching the wet ground, heedless that the\nwater soaked into his boots. And, after a minute, a low exclamation of\nsatisfaction broke from him as he found what he sought.\n\n\n\n\n                               CHAPTER XI\n\n                            _The Gangsters_\n\n\nGramont left the covert and walked forward.\n\nHe was thinking about that odd mention of Jachin Fell--had Chacherre\nlied in saying he had come here on his master's business? Perhaps. The\nman had come in Fell's car, and would not hesitate to lie about using\nthe car. For the moment, Gramont put away the circumstance, but did not\nforget it.\n\nHe walked openly toward the Gumberts buildings, thinking that he would\nhave time for a good look around the place before dusk fell; he would\nthen get off for Houma, and attend to Hammond's defence.\n\nAs for the place before him, he was convinced that it was abandoned. Had\nany one, other than Chacherre and his two friends, been about the\nbuildings, the late excitement would have brought out the fact. No one\nhad appeared, and the buildings seemed vacant.\n\nGramont's intent was simple and straightforward. In case he found, as he\nexpected to find, any evidence of illegal occupation about the place--as\nthe sheriff seemed to have discovered to his cost--he would lay\nChacherre and the other two men by the heels that night in Houma. He\nwould then go on to New Orleans and have Gumberts arrested, although he\nhad no expectation that the master crook could be held on the\nmurder-accessory charge. If this place were used for the lotteries,\neven, he was fairly certain that Memphis Izzy would have his own tracks\ncovered. The men higher up always did.\n\nHe walked straight in upon the barn. It loomed before him, closed, lurid\nin the level rays of the westering sun. The doors in front had been only\nloosely swung together and Gramont found them unlocked. He stood in the\nopening, and surprise gripped him. He was held motionless, gazing with\nastonished wonder at the sight confronting him.\n\nDirectly before him was a small roadster, one which he remembered to\nhave seen Jachin Fell using; in this car, doubtless, Ben Chacherre had\ndriven from the city. He recalled the fact later, with poignant regret\nfor a lost opportunity. But, at the present moment, he was lost in\namazement at the great number of other cars presenting themselves to his\nview.\n\nThey were lined up as deep as the barn would hold them, crammed into\nevery available foot of space; well over a dozen cars, he reckoned\nswiftly. What was more, all were cars of the highest class, with the\nexception of Fell's roadster. Directly before him were two which he was\nwell aware must have cost close upon ten thousand each. What did this\nmean? Certainly no one man or one group of men, in this back-country\nspot, could expect to use such an accumulation of expensive cars!\n\nGramont glanced around, but found no trace of machinery in the barn.\nRemembering the motor that he had heard, he turned from the doorway in\nfrowning perplexity. He strode on toward the long shed which stood\ncloser to the house. At the end of this shed was a door, and when he\ntried it, Gramont found it unlocked. It swung open to his hand, and he\nstepped inside.\n\nAt first he paused, confused by the vague objects around, for it was\nquite dark in here. A moment, and his eyes grew accustomed to the\ngloomier lighting. Details came to him: all around were cars and\nfragments of cars, chassis and bodies in all stages of dismemberment.\nStill more cars!\n\nHe slowly advanced to a long bench that ran the length of the shop\nbeneath the windows. A shop, indeed--a shop, he quickly perceived,\nfitted with every tool and machine necessary to the most complete\nautomobile repair establishment! Even an air-brush outfit, at one end,\ntogether with a drying compartment, spoke of repaint jobs.\n\nComprehension was slowly dawning upon the mind of Gramont; a moment\nlater it became certainty, when he came to a stop before an automobile\nengine lying on the bench. He found it to be the engine from a\nStutz--the latest multi-valve type adopted by that make of car, and this\nparticular bit of machinery looked like new.\n\nGramont inspected it, and he saw that the men had done their work well.\nThe original engine number had been carefully dug out, and the place as\ncarefully filled and levelled with metal. Beside it a new number had\nbeen stamped. A glance at the electrical equipment around showed that\nthese workers had every appliance with which to turn out the most\nfinished of jobs.\n\nAs he straightened up from the engine Gramont's eyes fell upon a typed\nsheet of paper affixed to the wall above the bench. His gaze widened as\nhe inspected it by the failing light. Upon that paper was a list of\ncars. After each car was a series of numbers plainly comprising the\noriginal numbers of the engine, body, radiator, and other component\nparts, followed by another series of new numbers to be inserted. That\nsheet of paper showed brains, organizing ability, care, and attention to\nthe last detail!\n\nHere was the most carefully planned and thorough system of automobile\nthievery that Gramont had ever heard of. He stood motionless, knowing\nthat this typed sheet of paper in itself was damning evidence against\nthe whole gang of workers. What was more to the point, that paper could\nbe traced; the typewriting could be traced to the man higher\nup--doubtless Memphis Izzy himself! These men ran in cars by the\nwholesale, probably from states adjacent to Louisiana. Here, at this\nsecluded point on the bayou, they changed the cars completely about, in\nnumber, paint, style of body, and then probably got rid of the new\nproduct in New Orleans.\n\nGramont stood motionless. Surprise had taken hold of him, and even a\nfeeling of slight dismay. This was not at all what he had hoped to find\nthere. He had thought to come upon some traces of the lottery game----\n\n\"Seen all you want, bo?\" said a voice behind him.\n\nGramont turned. He found himself gazing directly into an automatic\npistol over which glittered a pair of blazing eyes. The man was a\nstranger to him. The place had not been deserted, after all. He was\ncaught.\n\n\"Who are you?\" demanded Gramont, quietly.\n\n\"Me?\" The stranger was unsmiling, deadly. In those glittering eyes\nGramont read the ferocity of an animal at bay. \"I s'pose you would like\nto know that, huh? I guess you know enough right now to get all that's\ncomin' to you, bo! Got any particular business here? Speak up quick!\"\n\nGramont was silent. The other sneered at him, viciously.\n\n\"Hurry up! Turn over the name and address, and I'll notify the survivin'\nrelatives. Name, please?\"\n\n\"Henry Gramont,\" was the calm response. \"Don't get hasty, my friend.\nDidn't you see me here a little while ago with Chacherre and the other\nboys?\"\n\n\"What's that?\" The glittering eyes flamed up with suspicion and\ndistrust. \"Here--with them? No, I didn't. I been away fishing all\nafternoon. What the hell you doing around this joint?\"\n\n\"Your best scheme,\" said Gramont, coldly, \"is to change your style of\ntone, and to do it in a hurry! If you don't know what's happened here\nthis afternoon, don't ask me; you'll find out soon enough when the other\nboys get back. You'd better tell them I'm going to get in touch with\nMemphis Izzy the minute I get back to the city, and that the less\ntalking they do----\"\n\n\"What the hell's all this?\" demanded the other again, but with a\nsoftening of accent. The moniker of Gumberts had its effect, and seemed\nto shake the man instantly. Gramont smiled as he perceived that the game\nwas won.\n\n\"I never heard of no Gramont,\" went on the other, quickly. \"What you\ndoin' here?\"\n\n\"You're due to learn a good many things, I imagine,\" said Gramont,\ncarelessly. \"As for me, I happened on the place largely by accident. I\nhappen to be in partnership with a man named Jachin Fell, and I came out\nhere on business----\"\n\nTo Gramont's astonishment the pistol was lowered instantly. It was well\nthat he ceased speaking, for what he had just said proved to be open to\nmisconstruction, and if he had said any more he would have spoiled it.\nFor the man facing him was staring at him in mingled disgust and\nsurprise.\n\n\"You're in partnership with _the boss_!\" came the astounding words.\n\"Well, why in hell didn't you say all that in the first place, instead\no' beefin' around? That's no way to butt in, and me thinking you was\nsome dick on the job! Got anything to prove that you ain't pullin'\nsomething cute on me?\"\n\n\"Do you know Fell's writing?\" asked Gramont, with difficulty forcing\nhimself to meet the situation coherently. Jachin Fell--the boss!\n\n\"I know his mitt, all right.\"\n\nFrom his pocket Gramont produced a paper--the memorandum or agreement\nwhich he had drawn up with Fell on the previous afternoon, relating to\nthe oil company. The other man took it and switched on an electric light\nbulb overhead. In this glare he was revealed as a ratty little\nindividual with open mouth and teeth hanging out--an adenoidal type, and\ncertainly a criminal type.\n\nIt crossed the mind of Gramont that one blow would do the work--but he\nstood motionless. No sudden game would help him here. The discovery that\nFell was \"the boss\" paralyzed him completely. He had never dreamed of\nsuch a contingency. Fell, of all men!\n\nJachin Fell the \"boss\" of this establishment! Jachin Fell the man higher\nup--the brains behind this criminal organization! It was a perfect\nthunderbolt to Gramont. Now he understood why Chacherre was in the\nemploy of Fell--why no arrest of the man had been possible! Now he\nperceived that Chacherre must have told the truth about coming here on\nbusiness for Fell. Reaching farther back, he saw that Fell must have\nreceived the loot of the Midnight Masquer, must have turned it over to\nLucie Ledanois----\n\nDid _she_ know?\n\n\"All right, Mr. Gramont.\" The ratty little man turned to him with\nevident change of front. \"We ain't takin' no chances here, y'understand.\nGot quite a shipment of cars comin' in from Texas, and we're tryin' to\nget some o' these boats cleaned out to make room. Bring out any orders?\"\n\nGramont's brain worked fast.\n\nBy overcoming this guttersnipe he might have the whole place at his\nmercy--but that was not what he wanted. He suddenly realized that he had\nother and more important fish to fry in New Orleans. Gumberts was there.\nFell was there. What he must do demanded time, and his best play was to\ngain all the time possible, and to prevent this gang from suspecting him\nin any way.\n\n\"Did you see Ben Chacherre?\" he countered.\n\n\"Uh-huh--seen him just after he come. Gumberts will be out day after\nto-morrow, he said. The boss is framin' some sort of deal on a guy that\nhe wants laid away--some guy name o' Hammond. Chacherre is running it.\nHe figgers on gettin' Hammond on account of some car that's bein' hunted\nup----\"\n\nGramont laughed suddenly, for there was a grim humour about the thing.\nSo Jachin Fell wanted to \"get something\" on poor Hammond! And Chacherre\nhad seized the golden opportunity that presented itself this\nafternoon--instead of \"getting\" Hammond for the theft of a car,\nChacherre had coolly fastened murder upon him!\n\n\"Ben is one smart man; I expect he thinks the gods are working for him,\"\nsaid Gramont, thinly. \"So you don't know what happened to-day, eh? Well,\nit's great news, but I've got no time to talk about it. They'll tell you\nwhen they get back----\"\n\n\"Where'd they go?\" demanded the other.\n\n\"Houma. Now listen close! Chacherre did not know that I was in\npartnership with the boss, get me? I didn't want to tell all the crowd\nin front of him. Between you and me, the boss isn't any too sure about\nBen----\"\n\n\"Say, I get you there!\" broke in the other, sagely. \"I tells him six\nmonths ago to watch out for that Creole guy!\"\n\n\"Exactly. You can tell the boys about me when they come back--I don't\nsuppose Ben will be with them. Now, I've been looking over that place\nnext door----\"\n\n\"Oh!\" exclaimed the other, suddenly. \"Sure! The boss said that one of\nhis friends would be down to----\"\n\n\"I'm the one--or one of them,\" and Gramont chuckled as he reflected on\nthe ludicrous aspects of the whole affair. \"I'm going to Houma now, and\nthen back to the city. My car's over next door. Mr. Fell wanted me to\nwarn you to lay low on the lottery business. He's got a notion that\nsomeone's been talking.\"\n\n\"You go tell the boss,\" retorted the other in an aggrieved tone, \"to\nkeep his eye on the guys that _can_ talk! Who'd we talk to here?\nBesides, we're workin' our heads off on these here boats. Memphis Izzy\nis attending to the lottery--he's got the whole layout up to the house,\nand we ain't touching it, see? Tell the boss all that.\"\n\n\"Tell him yourself,\" Gramont laughed, good-humouredly. \"Gumberts is\ncoming out day after to-morrow, is he? That'll be Friday. Hm! I think\nthat I'd better bring Fell out here the same day, if I can make it. I\nprobably won't see Gumberts until then--I'm not working in with him and\nhe doesn't know me yet--but I'll try and get out here on Friday with\nFell. Now, I'll have to beat it in a hurry. Any message to send?\"\n\n\"Not me,\" was the answer.\n\nGramont scarcely knew how he departed, until he found himself scrambling\nback through the underbrush of the Ledanois place.\n\nHe rushed into the house, found the fire had died down beyond all\ndanger, and swiftly removed the few things they had taken from the car.\nCarrying these, he stumbled back to where he had hidden the automobile.\nHe scarcely dared to think, scarcely dared to congratulate himself on\nthe luck that had befallen him, until he found himself in his own car\nonce more, and with open throttle sweeping out through the twilight\ntoward Paradis and Houma beyond. A whirlwind of mad exultation was\nseething within him--exultation as sudden and tremendous as the past\nweeks had been uneventful and dragging!\n\nGramont, in common with many others, had heard much indefinite rumour of\nan underground lottery game that was being worked among the negroes of\nthe state and the Chinese villages along the Gulf coast. And now he knew\ndefinitely.\n\nLotteries have never died out in Louisiana since the brave old days of\nthe government-ordained gambles, laws and ordinances to the contrary. No\nlaws can make the yellow man and the black man forego the get-rich-quick\nheritage of their fathers. On the Pacific coast lotteries obtain and\nwill obtain wherever there is a Chinatown. In Louisiana the days of the\ngrand lottery have never been forgotten. The last two years of high\nwages had made every Negro wealthy, comparatively speaking. The lottery\nmongers would naturally find them a ripe harvest for the picking. And\nwho would gravitate to this harvest field if not the great Gumberts, the\nuncaught Memphis Izzy, the promoter who had never been \"mugged!\"\n\nHere, at one stroke, stumbling on the thing by sheer blind accident,\nGramont had located the nucleus of the whole business!\n\nGradually his brain cooled to the realization of what work lay before\nhim. He was through Paradis, almost without seeing the town, and\nswitched on his lights as he took the highway to Houma. Sober reflection\nseized him. Not only was this crowd of crooks working a lottery, but\nthey were also managing a stupendous thievery of automobiles, in which\ncars were looted by wholesale! And the man at the head of it all, the\nman above Memphis Izzy and his crooks, was Jachin Fell of New Orleans.\n\nDid Lucie Ledanois dream such a thing? No. Gramont dismissed the\nquestion at once. Fell was not an unusual type of man. There were many\nJachin Fells throughout the country, he reflected. Men who applied their\nbrains to crooked work, who kept themselves above any actual share in\nthe work, and who profited hugely by tribute money from every crook in\nevery crime.\n\nTo the communities in which they lived such men were patterns of all\nthat wealthy gentlemen should be. Seldom, except perhaps in gossip of\nthe underworld, was their connection with crime ever suspected.\nAnd--this thought was sobering to Gramont--never did they come within\ndanger of retribution at the hands of the law. Their ramifications\nextended too far into politics; and the governors of some southern\nstates have unlimited powers of pardon.\n\n\"This is a big day!\" reflected Gramont, dismissing the sinister\nsuggestion of this last thought. \"A big day! What it will lead to, I\ndon't know. Not the least of it is the financial end of it--the oil\nseepage! That little iridescent trickle of oil on the water means that\nmoney worries are over, both for me and for Lucie. I'm sorry that I am\nmixed up with Fell; I've enough money of my own to drill at least one\ngood well, and one is all we'll need to bring in oil on that place.\nWell, we'll see what turns up! My first job is to make sure Hammond is\nsafe, and to relieve his mind. I'll have to leave him in jail, I\nsuppose----\"\n\nWhy did Fell want to \"get something\" on Hammond? To this there was no\nanswer.\n\nHe drove into Houma to find the town abuzz with excitement, for the news\nof the sheriff's murder had stirred the place wildly. Proceeding\nstraight to the court house, Gramont encountered Ben Chacherre as he was\nleaving the car.\n\n\"Hello, there!\" he exclaimed. \"Lost my road. Where's Hammond?\"\n\nChacherre jerked his head toward the court house.\n\n\"In yonder. Say, are you going back to the city to-night?\"\n\n\"Yes.\" Gramont regarded him. \"Why?\"\n\n\"Take me back, will you? I've missed the last up train, and if you're\ngoin' back anyhow I won't have to hire a car. I can drive for you, and\nwe'll make it in a couple of hours, before midnight sure.\"\n\n\"Hop in,\" said Gramont, nodding toward the car. \"I'll be back as soon as\nI've had a word with Hammond. No danger of his getting lynched, I hope?\"\n\n\"Not a chance,\" said the other, conclusively. \"Six deputies up there\nnow, and quite a bunch of ex-soldiers comin' to stand guard. You goin'\nto fight the case?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Gramont. \"Can't fight a sure thing, can you? I'm sorry for\nhim, though.\"\n\nChacherre shrugged his shoulders and got into the car.\n\nGramont was much relieved to find that there was no danger of lynching,\nwhich had been his one fear. It was only with much persuasion that he\ngot past the guard and into the court house, where he was received by a\nnumber of deputies in charge of the situation.\n\nAfter conferring with them at some length, he was grudgingly taken to\nthe cell occupied by Hammond. The latter received him with a wide grin,\nand gave no signs of the gruelling ordeal through which he had passed.\n\n\"Listen, old man,\" said Gramont, earnestly. \"Will you play out the game\nhard to the end? I'll have to leave you here for two days. At the end of\nthat time you'll be free.\"\n\nThe listening deputies sniffed, but Hammond merely grinned again and put\na hand through the bars.\n\n\"Whatever you say, cap'n,\" he rejoined. \"It sure looks bad----\"\n\n\"Don't you think it,\" said Gramont, cheerfully. \"A lot of things have\nhappened since I saw you last! I've got the real murderer right where I\nwant him--but I can't have him arrested yet.\"\n\n\"It's a gang,\" said Hammond. \"You watch out, cap'n, I heard 'em say\nsomethin' about Memphis Izzy--remember the guy I told you about one day?\nWell, this is no piker's game! We're up against somethin' solid----\"\n\n\"I know it,\" and Gramont nodded. He turned to the deputies. \"Gentlemen,\nyou have my address if you wish to communicate with me. I shall be back\nhere day after to-morrow--at least, before midnight of that day. I warn\nyou, that if anything happens to this man in the meantime, you shall be\nheld personally responsible. He is innocent.\"\n\n\"Looks like we'd better hold you, too,\" said one of the men. \"You seem\nto know a lot!\"\n\nGramont looked at him a moment.\n\n\"I know enough to tell you where to head in if you try any funny work\nhere,\" he said, evenly. \"Gentlemen, thank you for permitting the\ninterview! I'll see you later.\"\n\nThe coroner's jury had already adjudged Hammond guilty of the murder.\nReturning to the car, Gramont had Ben Chacherre drive to a restaurant,\nwhere they got a bite to eat. Twenty minutes later they were on their\nway to New Orleans--and Gramont learned for the first time of Joseph\nMaillard's murder by the Midnight Masquer, and of the arrest of Bob\nMaillard for the crime.\n\n\n\n\n                              CHAPTER XII\n\n                            _The Ultimatum_\n\n\nUpon the following morning Gramont called both Jachin Fell and Lucie\nLedanois over the telephone. He acquainted them briefly with the result\nof his oil investigation, and arranged a meeting for ten o'clock, at\nFell's office.\n\nIt was slightly before ten when Gramont called with the car for Lucie.\nUnder the spell of her smiling eagerness, the harshness vanished from\nhis face; it returned again a moment later, for he saw that she, too,\nwas changed. There was above them both a cloud. That of Gramont was\nsecret and brooding. As for Lucie, she was in mourning. The murder of\nJoseph Maillard, the arrest and undoubted guilt of Bob Maillard, dwarfed\nall else in her mind. Even the news of the oil seepage, and the fact\nthat she was probably now on the road to wealth, appeared to make little\nimpression upon her.\n\n\"Thank heaven,\" she said, earnestly, as they drove toward Canal Street,\n\"that so far as you are concerned, Henry, the Midnight Masquer affair\nwas all cleared up before this tragedy took place! It was fearfully\nimprudent of you----\"\n\n\"Yes,\" answered Gramont, soberly, reading her thought. \"I can realize my\nown folly now. If this affair were to be laid at my door, some kind of a\ncase might be made up against me, and it would seem plausible. But,\nfortunately, I was out of it in time. Were we merely characters in a\nstandardized detective story, I suppose I'd be arrested and deluged with\nsuspense and clues and so forth.\"\n\n\"Your escape was too narrow to joke over, Henry,\" she reproved him,\ngravely.\n\n\"I'm not joking, my dear Lucie. I learned nothing about the tragedy\nuntil late last night. From what I can find in the papers, it seems\nagreed that Bob was not the real Masquer, but had assumed that guise for\na joke. A tragic joke! Since he was undoubtedly drunk at the time, his\nstory can't be relied upon as very convincing. And yet, it's frightfully\nhard to believe that, even by accident, a son should have shot down his\nown father----\"\n\n\"Don't!\" Lucie winced a little. \"In spite of all the evidence against\nhim, in spite of the way he was found with that aviation uniform, it's\nstill awful to believe. I can't realize that it has actually happened.\"\n\n\"According to the papers, poor Mrs. Maillard has gone to pieces. No\nwonder.\"\n\n\"Yes. I was there with her all day yesterday, and shall go again to-day.\nThey say Bob is terribly broken up. He sent for his mother, and she\nrefused to see him. I don't know how it is all going to end! Do you\nthink his story might be true--that somebody else might have acted as\nthe Masquer that night?\"\n\nGramont shook his head.\n\n\"It's possible,\" he said, reluctantly, \"yet it hardly seems very\nprobable. And now, Lucie, I'm very sorry indeed to say it--but you must\nprepare yourself against another shock in the near future.\"\n\n\"What do you mean? About the oil----\"\n\n\"No. It's too long a story to tell you now; here we are at the Maison\nBlanche. Just remember my words, please. It's something that I can't go\ninto now.\"\n\n\"Very well. Henry! Do you think that it's possible your chauffeur,\nHammond, could have learned about the drinking party, and could\nhave----\"\n\nGramont started. \"Hammond? No. I'll answer for him beyond any question,\nLucie. By the way, does Fell know anything about Hammond having been the\nfirst Masquer?\"\n\n\"Not from me,\" said the girl, watching him.\n\n\"Very well. Hammond got into a bit of trouble at Houma, and I had to\nleave him there. It was none of his fault, and he'll get out of it all\nright. Well, come along up to our oil meeting! Forget your troubles, and\ndon't let my croakings about a new shock cause you any worry just yet.\"\n\nHe was thinking of Jachin Fell, and the girl's closeness to Fell. Had he\nnot known that Fell was responsible for Hammond's being in jail, he\nmight have felt differently. As it was, he was now fore-warned and\nfore-armed, although he could not see what animus Fell could possibly\nhave against Hammond.\n\nIt was lucky, he reflected grimly, that he had never breathed to a soul\nexcept Lucie the fact that Hammond had been the first Masquer! Had Fell\nknown this fact, his desire to lay Hammond by the heels might have been\neasily fulfilled--and Hammond would probably have found himself charged\nwith Maillard's murder.\n\nThey found Jachin Fell dictating to a stenographer. He greeted them\nwarmly, ushering them at once into his private office.\n\nGramont found it difficult to convince himself that his experiences of\nthe previous afternoon had been real. It was almost impossible to\nbelieve that this shy, apologetic little man in gray was in reality the\n\"man higher up!\" Yet he knew it to be the case--knew it beyond any\nescape.\n\n\"By the way,\" and Fell turned to Gramont, \"if you'll dictate a brief\nstatement concerning that oil seepage, I'd be obliged! Merely give the\nfacts. I may have need of such a statement from you.\"\n\nGramont nodded and joined the stenographer in the outer office where he\ndictated a brief statement. It did not occur to him that there might be\ndanger in this; at the moment, he was rather off his guard. He was\nthinking so much about his future assault on Fell that he quite ignored\nthe possibility of being placed on the defensive.\n\nWithin five minutes he had returned to Lucie and Jachin Fell, who were\ndiscussing the condition of Mrs. Maillard. Gramont signed the statement\nand handed it to Fell, who laid it with other papers at his elbow.\n\n\"I suppose we may proceed to business?\" began Fell. \"I have drawn up\narticles of partnership; we can apply for incorporation later if we so\ndesire. Lucie, both Henry Gramont and I are putting twenty-five thousand\ndollars into this company, while you are putting in your land, which I\nam valuing at an equal amount. The stock, therefore, will be divided\nequally among us. That is understood?\"\n\n\"Yes. It's very good of you, Uncle Jachin,\" said the girl, quietly.\n\"I'll leave everything to your judgment.\"\n\nThe little gray man smiled.\n\n\"Judgment is a poor horse to ride, as Eliza said when she crossed the\nice. Here's everything in black and white. I suggest that you both\nglance over the articles, sign up, and we will then hold our first\nmeeting.\"\n\nGramont and Lucie read over the partnership agreement, and found it\nperfectly correct.\n\n\"Very well, then, the meeting is called to order!\" Jachin Fell smiled as\nhe rapped on the desk before him. \"Election of officers--no, wait! The\nfirst thing on hand is to give our company a name. Suggestions?\"\n\n\"I was thinking of that last night,\" said Lucie, smiling a little. \"Why\nnot call it the 'American Prince Oil Company'?\" And her eyes darted to\nGramont merrily.\n\n\"Excellent!\" exclaimed Jachin Fell. \"My vote falls with yours, my\ndear--I'll fill in the blanks with that name. Now to the election of\nofficers.\"\n\n\"I nominate Jachin Fell for president,\" said Gramont, quickly.\n\n\"Seconded!\" exclaimed the girl, gaily, a little colour in her pale\ncheeks.\n\n\"Any other nominations? If not, so approved and ordered,\" rattled Fell,\nlaughingly. \"For the office of treasurer----\"\n\n\"Miss Lucie Ledanois!\" said Gramont. \"Move nominations be closed.\"\n\n\"Seconded and carried by a two-thirds vote of stockholders,\" chirped\nFell in his toneless voice. \"So approved and ordered. For secretary----\"\n\n\"Our third stockholder,\" put in Lucie. \"He'll have to be an officer, of\ncourse!\"\n\n\"Seconded and carried. So approved and ordered.\" Mr. Fell rapped on the\ntable. \"We will now have the report of our expert geologist in further\ndetail than yet given.\"\n\nGramont told of finding the oil; he was not carried away by the gay\nmock-solemnity of Jachin Fell, and he remained grave. He went on to\nrelate how he had secured the lease option upon the adjoining land, and\nsuggested that other such options be secured at once upon other property\nin the neighbourhood. He handed the option to Fell, who laid it with the\nother documents.\n\n\"And now I have a proposal of my own to make,\" said Jachin Fell. He\nappeared sobered, as though influenced by Gramont's manner. \"Although\nwe've actually found oil on the place, there is no means of telling how\nmuch we'll find when we drill, or what quality it will be. Is that not\ncorrect, Mr. Gramont?\"\n\n\"Entirely so,\" assented Gramont. \"The chances are, of course, that we'll\nfind oil in both quality and quantity. On the other hand, the seepage\nmay be all there is. Oil is a gamble from start to finish. Personally,\nhowever, I would gamble heavily on this prospect.\"\n\n\"Naturally,\" said Mr. Fell. \"However, I have been talking over the oil\nbusiness with a number of men actively engaged in it in the Houma field.\nI think that I may safely say that I can dispose of the mineral rights\nto our company's land, together with this lease option secured yesterday\non the adjoining land, for a sum approximating one hundred and fifty\nthousand dollars; reserving to our company a sixteenth interest in any\noil located on the property. Personally, I believe this can be done, and\nI am willing to undertake the negotiations if so empowered by a note of\nour stockholders. Lucie, you do not mind if we smoke, I know? Let me\noffer you a cigar, Mr. Gramont.\"\n\nGramont took one of the El Reys offered him, and lighted it amid a\nstartled silence. Fell's proposal came to him as a distinct shock, and\nalready he was viewing it in the light of prompt suspicion.\n\n\"Why,\" exclaimed Lucie, wide-eyed, \"that would be fifty thousand dollars\nto each of us, and not a cent expended!\"\n\n\"In case it went through on that basis,\" added Jachin Fell, his eyes on\nGramont, \"I would vote that the entire sum go to Miss Ledanois. Her land\nalone is involved. If she then wishes to invest with us in a new company\nto exploit other fields, well and good. One moment, my dear! Do not\nprotest this suggestion. The sixteenth interest reserved to our company\nwould provide both Mr. Gramont and me with a substantial reward for our\nslight activity in the matter. Don't forget that interest, for it might\namount to a large figure.\"\n\n\"Right,\" assented Gramont. \"I would second your vote, Mr. Fell; I think\nthe idea very just and proper that Miss Ledanois should receive the\nentire amount.\"\n\nLucie seemed a trifle bewildered.\n\n\"But--but, Henry!\" she exclaimed. \"What do you think of selling the\nlease to these other men?\"\n\nGramont eyed the smoke from his cigar reflectively, quite conscious that\nMr. Fell was regarding him very steadily.\n\n\"I can't answer for you, Lucie,\" he said at last. \"I would not presume\nto advise.\"\n\nMr. Fell looked slightly relieved. Lucie, however, persisted.\n\n\"What would you do, then, if you were in my place?\"\n\nGramont shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"In that case,\" he said, slowly, \"I would gamble. We know oil is in that\nground; we know that it has been found in large quantities at Houma or\nnear there. To my mind there is no doubt whatever that under your land\nlies a part of the same oil field--and a rich one. To sell\nfifteen-sixteenths of that oil for a hundred and fifty thousand is to\ngive it away. I would sooner take my chances on striking a\ntwenty-thousand barrel gusher and having the whole of it to myself.\nHowever, by all means disregard my words; this is not my affair.\"\n\nLucie glanced at Jachin Fell.\n\n\"You think it is the best thing to do; Henry does not,\" mused the girl.\n\"I know that you're both thinking of me--of getting that money for me.\nJust the same, Uncle Jachin, I--I won't be prudent! I'll gamble!\nBesides,\" she added with smiling na\u00c3\u00afvet\u00c3\u00a9, \"I'm not a bit willing to give\nup having a real oil company the very minute it is formed! So we'll\noutvote you, Uncle Jachin.\"\n\nDespite their tension, the two men smiled at her final words.\n\n\"That motion of mine has not yet been made,\" said Fell. Her rejection of\nhis proposal had no effect upon his shyly smooth manner. \"Will you\nexcuse us one moment, Lucie? If I may speak with you in the outer\noffice, Mr. Gramont, I would like to show you some confidential matters\nwhich might influence your decision in this regard.\"\n\nLucie nodded and leaned back in her chair.\n\nGramont accompanied Fell to the outer office, where Fell sent the\nstenographer to keep Lucie company. When the door had closed and they\nwere alone, Fell took a chair and motioned Gramont to another. A cold\nbrusquerie was evident in his manner.\n\n\"Gramont,\" he said, briskly, \"I am going to make that motion, and I want\nyou to vote with me against Lucie. Unfortunately, I have only a third of\nthe voting power. I might argue Lucie into agreement, but she is a\ndifficult person to argue with. So I mean that you shall vote with\nme--and I'm going to put my cards on the table before you.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" Gramont regarded him coolly. \"Your cards will have to be powerful\npersuaders!\"\n\n\"They are,\" returned Jachin Fell. \"I have been carefully leading up to\nthis point--the point of selling. I have practically arranged the whole\naffair. I propose to sell the mineral rights in that land, largely on\nthe strength of the signed statement you gave me a few moments ago. That\nstatement is going to be given wide publicity, and it will be\nsubstantiated by other reports on the oil seepage.\"\n\n\"You interest me strangely.\" Gramont leaned back in his chair. The eyes\nof the two men met and held in cold challenge, cold hostility. \"What's\nyour motive, Fell?\"\n\n\"I'll tell you: it's the interest of Lucie Ledanois.\" In the gaze of\nFell was a strange earnestness. In those pale gray eyes was now a light\nof fierce sincerity which startled and warned Gramont. Fell continued\nwith a trace of excitement in his tone.\n\n\"I've known that girl all her life, Gramont, and I love her as a father.\nI loved her mother before her--in a different way. I can tell you that\nat this moment Lucie is poor. Her house is mortgaged; she does not know,\nin fact, just how poor she really is. Of course, she will accept no\nmoney from me in gift. But for her to get a hundred and fifty thousand\nin a business deal will solve all her problems, set her on her feet for\nlife!\"\n\n\"I see,\" said Gramont with harsh impulse. \"What do you get out of it?\"\n\nHe regretted the words instantly. Fell half rose from his chair as\nthough to answer them with a blow. Gramont, aware of his mistake,\nhastened to retract it.\n\n\"Forgive me, Fell,\" he said, quickly. \"That was an unjust insinuation,\nand I know it. Yet, I can't find myself in agreement with you. I'm\nfirmly set in the belief that a fortune in oil will be made off that\nland of Lucie's. I simply can't agree to sell out for a comparative\npittance, and I'll fight to persuade her against doing it! As I look at\nit, the thing would not be just to her. I'm thinking, as you are, only\nof her interest.\"\n\nA light of sardonic mockery glittered in the pale eyes of Jachin Fell.\n\n\"You are basing your firm conviction,\" he queried, \"very largely upon\nyour discovery of the free oil?\"\n\n\"To a large extent, yes.\"\n\n\"I thought you would,\" and Fell laughed harshly.\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"I mean,\" said the other, fiercely earnest, \"that for a month I've\nworked to sell that land! I had young Maillard hooked and landed--it\nwould have been poetic justice to make him hand over a small fortune to\nLucie! But that deal is off, since he's in jail. And do you know why\nyoung Maillard wanted to buy the land? For the same reason you don't\nwant to sell. I sent him out there and he saw that oil seepage, as I\nmeant that he should! He thought he would skin Lucie out of her land,\nnot dreaming that I had prepared a nice little trap to swallow him. And\nnow you come along----\"\n\n\"Man, what are you driving at?\" exclaimed Gramont. He was startled by\nwhat he read in the other man's face.\n\n\"Merely that I planted that oil seepage myself--or had it done by men I\ncould trust,\" said Jachin Fell, calmly. He sat back in his chair and\ntook up his cigar with an air of finality. \"The confession is shameless.\nI love Lucie more than my own ethical purity. Besides, I intend to wrong\nno one in the matter.\"\n\nGramont sat stunned beyond words. The oil seepage--a plant!\n\nThe thing could have been very easily done, of course. As he sat silent\nthere unfolded before him the motives that underlay Fell's entire\naction. The amazing disclosure of Jachin Fell's intrigue to enrich the\ngirl left him bewildered. This, coupled with what he had learned on the\npreceding day about Jachin Fell, put his own course of action into grave\nperplexity.\n\nThere was no reason to doubt what Fell said. Gramont believed the little\nman sincere in his love for Lucie.\n\n\"No matter what the outcome, your reputation will not be affected,\" said\nFell, quietly. \"The company which will buy this land of Lucie's is\ncontrolled by me. You understand? Even if no oil is ever found there, I\nshall see to it that you will not be injured because of that signed\nstatement.\"\n\nGramont nodded dull comprehension. He realized that Fell had devised\nthis whole business scheme with infernal ingenuity; had devised it in\norder to take a hundred and fifty thousand dollars out of his own pocket\nand put it into that of Lucie. It was a present which the girl would\nnever accept as a gift, but which, if it came in the way of business,\nwould make her financially independent. Nobody would be defrauded. There\nwas no chicanery about it. The thing was straight enough.\n\n\"That's not quite all of my plan,\" pursued Fell, as though reading\nGramont's unuttered thoughts. \"The minute this news becomes public, the\nminute your statement is published, there will be a tremendous boom in\nthat whole section. I shall take charge of Lucie's money, and within\nthree weeks I should double it, treble it, for her. Before the boom\nbursts she will be out of it all, and wealthy. Now, my dear Gramont, I\ndo not presume that you will still refuse to vote with me? I have been\nquite frank, you see.\"\n\nGramont stirred in his chair.\n\n\"Yes!\" he said, low-voiced. \"Yes, by heavens, I do refuse!\"\n\nWith an effort he checked hotly impulsive words that were on his tongue.\nOne word now might ruin him. He dared not say that he did not want to\nsee Fell's money pass into the hands of Lucie--money gained by fraud and\ntheft and crime! He dared not give his reasons for refusing. He meant\nnow to crush Fell utterly--but one wrong word would give the man full\nwarning. He must say nothing.\n\n\"It's not straight work, Fell. Regardless of your motives, I refuse to\njoin you.\"\n\nJachin Fell sighed slightly, and laid down his cigar with precision.\n\n\"Gramont,\" his voice came with the softly purring menace of a tiger's\nthroat-tone, \"I shall now adjourn this company meeting for two days,\nuntil Saturday morning, in order to give you a little time to\nreconsider. To-day is Thursday. By Saturday----\"\n\n\"I need no time,\" said Gramont.\n\n\"But you will need it. I suppose you know that Bob Maillard has been\narrested for parricide? You are aware of the evidence against him--all\ncircumstantial?\"\n\nGramont frowned. \"What has that got to do with our present business?\"\n\n\"Quite a bit, I fancy.\" A thin smile curved the lips of Jachin Fell.\n\"Maillard is not guilty of the murder--but you are.\"\n\n\"Liar!\" Gramont started from his chair as those three words burned into\nhim. \"Liar! Why, you know that I went home----\"\n\n\"Ah, wait!\" Fell lifted his hand for peace. His voice was calm. \"Ansley\nand I both saw you depart, certainly. We have since learned that you did\nnot reach home until some time after midnight. You have positively no\nalibi, Gramont. You may allege, of course, that you were wandering the\nstreets----\"\n\n\"As I was!\" cried Gramont, heatedly.\n\n\"Then prove it, my dear fellow; prove it--if you can. Now, we shall keep\nLucie out of all this. What remains? I know that you were the Midnight\nMasquer. My man, Ben Chacherre, can prove by another man who accompanied\nhim that the Masquer's loot was taken from your car. A dictograph in the\nprivate office, yonder, has a record of the talk between us of the other\nmorning, in which you made patent confession to being the Masquer.\n\n\"Once let me hand this array of evidence over to the district attorney,\nand you will most certainly stand trial. And, if you do stand trial, I\ncan promise you faithfully that you will meet conviction. I have\nfriends, you see, and many of them are influential in such small\nmatters.\"\n\nIt was not a nice smile that curved the lips of Fell.\n\nGramont choked back any response, holding himself to silence with a firm\nwill. He dared say nothing, lest he say too much. He saw that Fell could\nindeed make trouble for him--and that he must strike his own blow at\nFell without great delay. It was a battle, now; a fight to the end.\n\nFell regarded Gramont cheerfully, seeming to take this crushed silence\nas evidence of his own triumph.\n\n\"Further,\" he added, \"your man Hammond is now in jail at Houma, as you\nknow, for the murder of the sheriff. Now, my influence is not confined\nto this city, Gramont, I may be able to clear Hammond of this charge--if\nyou decide to vote with me. I may keep what I know about the Midnight\nMasquer from the press and from the district attorney--if you decide to\nvote with me. You comprehend?\"\n\nGramont nodded. He saw now why Fell wanted to \"get something\" on\nHammond. Fell had rightly reasoned that Gramont would do more to save\nHammond than to save himself.\n\n\"You think I murdered Maillard, then?\" he asked.\n\n\"Gramont, I don't know what to think, and that's the honest truth!\"\nanswered Fell, with a steady regard. \"But I am absolutely determined to\nput this oil deal across, to make Lucie Ledanois at least independent,\nif not wealthy. I can do it, I've made all my plans to do it, and--I\n_will_ do it!\n\n\"We'll hold another meeting day after to-morrow--Saturday morning.\" Fell\nrose. \"That will give me time to conclude all arrangements. I trust, Mr.\nGramont, that you will vote with me for the adjournment?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Gramont, dully. \"I will.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" and Jachin Fell bowed slightly, not without a trace of\nmockery in his air.\n\n\n\n\n                              CHAPTER XIII\n\n                         _The Coin Falls Heads_\n\n\nGramont sat in his own room that afternoon. It seemed to him that he had\nbeen away from the city for weeks and months. Yet only a day had\nintervened. He sat fingering the only piece of mail that had come to\nhim--a notice from the post of the American Legion which he had joined,\nto the effect that there would be a meeting that Thursday evening. Only\nThursday! And to-morrow was Friday.\n\nIf he was to effect anything against the headquarters of Fell's gang he\nmust act on the morrow or not at all. Gumberts was to be out there\nto-morrow. Gumberts would talk with the ratty little man of the\nprojecting teeth and adenoids, would find Gramont had imposed upon the\nfellow, and there would be upheavals. The gang would take to flight,\ncertainly, or at least make certain that Gramont's mouth was shut.\n\nHe sat fingering the postal from the Legion, and turning over events in\nhis mind. Against Fell he had particular animosity. All that the little\ngray man had done had been done with the thought of Lucie Ledanois as a\nspur.\n\n\"Yet he can't realize that Lucie wouldn't have the money if she knew\nthat it came from criminal sources,\" he thought, smiling bitterly. \"He's\nbeen scheming a long time to make a fortune for her, and now he's\ndetermined to push it through regardless of me. It was clever of him to\njail Hammond! He guessed that I'd do a great deal to save the\nredhead--more even than to save myself. Mighty clever! And now he's\npretty sure that he's got me between a cleft stick, where I can't\nwriggle.\n\n\"If I'm to strike a blow, I'll have to do it to-morrow--before noon\nto-morrow, also. I'll have to leave here mighty early, and get there\nbefore Gumberts does. What was it Hammond said that day about him--that\nnobody in the country had ever caught Memphis Izzy? I bet I could do it,\nand his whole gang with him--if I knew how. There's the rub! Fell won't\nhesitate a minute in having me arrested. And as he said, once he got me\narrested, I'd be gone. He must be able to exert powerful influence, that\nman!\"\n\nShould he strike or not? If he struck, he might expect the full weight\nof Jachin Fell's vengeance--unless his blow would include Fell among the\nvictims.\n\nGramont was still pondering this dilemma when Ben Chacherre arrived.\n\nGramont heard the man's voice on the stairs. Ben's impudence, perhaps\nadded to his name and the Creole French upon his lips, had carried him\npast the concierge unannounced, although not without a continued\nexchange of repartee that served to give Gramont warning of the visitor.\nSmiling grimly, Gramont drew a coin from his pocket, and flipped it.\n\nThe coin fell heads. He pocketed it again as Ben Chacherre knocked, and\nopened the door.\n\n\"Ah, Chacherre!\" he exclaimed. \"Come in.\"\n\nBen swaggered inside and closed the door.\n\n\"Brought a message for you, Mr. Gramont,\" he said, jauntily, and\nextended a note.\n\nGramont tore open the envelope and read a curt communication:\n\n    Kindly let me know your answer as soon as possible. By to-morrow\n    evening at the latest. It will be necessary to arrange affairs\n    for Saturday.\n\n                                                        JACHIN FELL.\n\nTo arrange affairs! Fell was taking for granted that Gramont would give\nan assent, under force of persuasion, to the scheme. He would probably\nhave everything in readiness, and if assured by Friday night of\nGramont's assent, would then pull his strings and perhaps complete the\nwhole deal before the following Monday.\n\nThe meeting of the company had been adjourned to Saturday morning.\nGramont thought a moment, then went to his buhl escritoire and opened\nit. Chacherre had already taken a seat. Gramont wrote:\n\n    MY DEAR MR. FELL,\n\n    If you will arrange the company meeting for to-morrow evening,\n    say nine o'clock, at your office, I think that everything may\n    then be arranged. As I may not see Miss Ledanois in the\n    meantime, will you be kind enough to assure her presence at the\n    meeting?\n\nHe addressed an envelope to Fell's office, and then stamped and pocketed\nit.\n\n\"Well, Chacherre,\" he said, rising and returning to the Creole, \"any\nfurther news from Houma? They haven't found the real murderer yet?\"\n\nThe other came to his feet with an exclamation of surprise. As he did\nso, Gramont's fist caught him squarely on the point of the jaw.\n\nChacherre crumpled back across his chair, senseless for the moment.\n\n\"I'm afraid to take any chances with you, my fine bird,\" said Gramont,\nrubbing his knuckles. \"You're too clever by far, and too handy with your\nweapons!\"\n\nHe obtained cloths, and firmly bound the ankles and wrists of Chacherre.\nNot content with this, he placed the man in the chair and tied him to it\nwith merciless knots. As he was finishing his task, Chacherre opened his\neyes and gazed rapidly around.\n\n\"Awake at last, are you?\" said Gramont, genially. He got his pipe,\nfilled and lighted it. The eyes of Chacherre were now fastened upon him\nvenomously. \"Too bad for you, Chacherre, that the coin fell heads up!\nThat spelled action.\"\n\n\"Are you crazy?\" muttered the other in French. Gramont laughed, and\nresponded in the same tongue.\n\n\"It does look that way, doesn't it? You're slippery, but now you're\ncaught.\"\n\nChacherre must have realized that he stood in danger. He checked a\ncurse, and regarded Gramont with a steady coolness.\n\n\"Be careful!\" he said, his voice deadly. \"What do you mean by this?\"\n\nGramont looked at him and puffed his pipe.\n\n\"The game's up, Ben,\" he observed. \"I know all about the place down\nthere--about the cars, and about the lottery. Your gang has had a\npleasant time, eh? But now you and the others are going to do a little\nwork for the state on the road gangs.\"\n\n\"Bah! _\u00c3\u0087a? va riv\u00c3\u00a9 dans semaine quatte zheudis!_\" spat Chacherre,\ncontemptuously. \"That will happen in the week of four Thursdays, you\nfool! So you know about things, eh? My master will soon shut your\nmouth!\"\n\n\"He can't,\" said Gramont, placidly. \"You'll all be under arrest.\"\n\nChacherre laughed scornfully, then spoke with that deadly gravity.\n\n\"Look here--you're a stranger here? Well, since you know so much, I'll\ntell you more! We can't be arrested, and even if you get us pinched,\nwe'll never be convicted. Do you understand? We have influence! There\nare men here in New Orleans, men in the legislature, men at Washington,\nwho will never see us molested!\"\n\n\"They'll be surprised,\" said Gramont, although he felt that the man's\nwords were true. \"But not all of them are your friends, Ben. I don't\nthink the governor of the state is in your gang. He's a pretty straight\nman, Ben.\"\n\n\"He's a fool like you! What is he? A puppet! He can do nothing except\npardon us if the worst happens. You can't touch us.\"\n\n\"Well, maybe not,\" agreed Gramont, tapping at his pipe. \"Maybe not, but\nwe'll see! You seem mighty sure of where you stand, Ben.\"\n\nEncouraged, Ben Chacherre laughed insolently.\n\n\"Let me loose,\" he commanded. \"Or else you'll go over the road for the\nMidnight Masquer's work! My master has a dictograph in his office, and\nhas your confession on record.\"\n\n\"So?\" queried Gramont, his brows lifted. \"You seem much in Mr. Fell's\nconfidence, Ben. But I think I'll leave you tied up a little while.\nMemphis Izzy is going down to his summer cottage to-morrow, isn't he?\nI'll be there--but you won't. By the way, I think I'd better look\nthrough your pockets.\"\n\nBen Chacherre writhed suddenly, hurling a storm of curses at Gramont.\n\nThe latter, unheeding the contortions of his captive, searched the man\nthoroughly. Except for a roll of money, the pockets gave up little of\ninterest. The only paper Gramont secured was a fresh telegraph blank. He\nwould have passed this unheeded had he not noted a snaky flitting of\nChacherre's eyes to it.\n\n\"Ah!\" he said, pleasantly. \"You appear to be interested in this, Ben.\nPray, what is the secret?\"\n\nChacherre merely glared at him in silence. Gramont inspected the blank,\nand a sudden exclamation broke from him. He held the bit of yellow paper\nto the light at varying angles.\n\n\"It's the most natural thing in the world,\" he said after a moment, \"for\na man to walk into a telegraph office, write out his telegram, and then\nfind that he's torn two blanks instead of one from the pad on the desk.\nEh? I've done it, often--and I've always put the extra blank into my\npocket, Ben, thinking it might come in handy; just as you did, eh? Now\nlet's see!\n\n\"You were excited when you wrote this, weren't you? You'd just thought\nof something very important, and you took care of it hurriedly--that\nmade you jab down your pencil pretty hard. Who's Dick Hearne at Houma?\nAn agent of the gang there?\"\n\nChacherre merely glared, sullenly defiant. Word by word, Gramont made\nout the message:\n\n       Burn bundle under rear seat my car. Have done at once.\n\nGramont looked up and smiled thinly.\n\n\"Your car? Why, you left it in the garage at Gumberts' place, eh? That\nlittle roadster of Fell's, with the extra seat behind. If you'd been\njust a little bit cooler yesterday, Ben, you would have made fewer\nmistakes. It never occurred to you that other people might have been\nthere in the bushes when the sheriff was murdered, eh?\"\n\nChacherre went livid.\n\n\"It was another mistake to throw away your knife after you killed him,\"\npursued Gramont, reflectively. \"You should have held on to that knife,\nBen. There's no blood, remember, on Hammond's knife--a hard thing for\nyou and your friends to explain plausibly. Yet your knife is heavy with\nblood, which tests will show to be human blood. Also, the knife has your\nname on it; quite a handsome knife, too. On the whole, you must admit\nthat you bungled the murder from start to finish----\"\n\nChacherre broke in with a frightful oath--a frantically obscene storm of\ncurses. So furious were his words that Gramont very efficiently gagged\nhim with cloths, gagged him hard and fast.\n\n\"You also bungled when you forgot all about burning that bundle, in your\nexcitement over getting Hammond jailed for the murder,\" he observed,\nwatching Chacherre writhe. \"No, you can't get loose, Ben. You'll suffer\na little between now and the time of your release, but I really can't\nspare much pity on you.\n\n\"I think that I'll send another wire to Dick Hearne on this blank which\nyou so thoughtfully provided. I'll order him, in your name, not to burn\nthat bundle after all; I fancy it may prove of some value to me. And\nI'll also tell your friend--I suppose he has some familiar cognomen,\nsuch as Slippery Dick--to meet Henry Gramont at Houma early in the\nmorning. I'd like to gather Dick in with the other gentlemen. I'll\nmention that you were kind enough to supply a few names and incidents.\"\n\nAt this last Ben Chacherre writhed anew, for it was a shrewd blow. He\nand his friends belonged to that class of crook which never \"peaches.\"\nIf by any mischance one of this class is jailed and convicted, he\ninvariably takes his medicine silently, knowing that the whole gang is\nbehind him, and that when he emerges from prison he will be sure to find\nmoney and friends and occupation awaiting him.\n\nTo know that he would be placed, in the estimation of the gang, in the\nsame class with stool-pigeons, must have bitten deeper into Ben\nChacherre than any other lash. He stared at Gramont with a frightful\nhatred in his blazing eyes--a hatred which gradually passed into a look\nof helplessness and of impotent despair.\n\nGramont, meantime, was writing out the telegram to Dick Hearne. This\nfinished, he got his hat and coat, and from the bureau drawer took an\nautomatic pistol, which he pocketed. Then he smiled pleasantly at his\nprisoner.\n\n\"I'll be back a little later, Ben, and I'll probably bring a friend with\nme--a friend who will sit up with you to-night and take care of your\nhealth. Kind of me, eh? It's getting late in the afternoon, but I don't\nthink that it will harm you to go without any dinner. I'll 'phone Mr.\nFell that you said you'd be away for a few hours, eh?\n\n\"This evening, Ben, I think that I'll attend a meeting of my post of the\nAmerican Legion. You don't belong to that organization by any chance?\nNo, I'm quite sure you don't. Very few of your exclusive acquaintances\ndo belong. Well, see you later! Work on those bonds all you like--you're\nquite safe. I'm curious to see what is in that bundle under the rear\nseat of your car; I have an idea that it may prove interesting. Good\nafternoon!\"\n\nGramont closed the door, and left the house.\n\nGoing downtown, he mailed the letter to Fell, confident that the latter\nwould receive it on the following morning; but he did not telephone\nFell. He preferred to leave the absence of Chacherre unexplained,\nrightly judging that Fell would not be particularly anxious about the\nman. It was now Thursday evening. The meeting of the oil company would\nbe held at nine on Friday evening. Between those two times Gramont\nfigured on many things happening.\n\nHe chuckled as he sent the telegram to Dick Hearne at Houma--a telegram\nsigned with the name Chacherre, instructing Hearne not to burn the\nbundle, but to meet Gramont early in the morning at Houma. He had a very\nshrewd idea that this Dick Hearne might prove an important person to\ndispose of, and quite useful after he had been disposed of. In this\nconjecture he was right.\n\n\n\n\n                              CHAPTER XIV\n\n                         _Chacherre's Bundle_\n\n\nIt was seven in the morning when Henry Gramont drove his car into Houma.\n\nIn the wire which he had sent over Chacherre's signature he had\ncommanded Dick Hearne to meet Gramont at about this time at a restaurant\nnear the court house. Putting his car at the curb, Gramont went into the\nrestaurant and ordered a hasty breakfast. He had brought with him copies\nof the morning papers, and was perusing the accounts of Bob Maillard's\npitifully weak story regarding his father's murder, when a stranger\nstopped beside him.\n\n\"Gramont?\" said the other. \"Thought it was you. Hearne's my name--I had\norders to meet you. What's up?\"\n\nThe other man dropped into the chair opposite Gramont, who put away his\npapers. Hearne was a sleek individual of pasty complexion who evidently\nserved the gang in no better light than as a go-between and runner of\nerrands. That he suspected nothing was plain from his casual manner,\nalthough he had never seen Gramont previously.\n\n\"Business,\" said Gramont, leaning back to let the waitress serve his\nbreakfast. When she had departed, he attacked it hungrily. \"You got\nChacherre's wire about the stuff in his car? Was it burned?\"\n\n\"No. He countermanded it just as I was hirin' a car to go over to\nParadis,\" said Hearne. \"What's stirrin', anyhow?\"\n\n\"Plenty. Memphis Izzy's coming down to-day. When'll he get in?\"\n\n\"He'll go direct to the other place, won't come here. Oh, I reckon he'll\nget there along about nine this morning. Why?\"\n\n\"We'll have to go over there to meet him,\" said Gramont. \"I stopped in\nhere to pick you up. Hammond is still safe in jail?\"\n\n\"Sure.\" Hearne laughed evilly. \"I don't guess he'll get out in a hurry,\nneither!\"\n\n\"Chacherre was pinched last night for the murder,\" said Gramont,\nwatching the other.\n\n\"The hell!\" Hearne looked astonished, then relaxed and laughed again.\n\"Some fly cop will sure lose his buttons, then! They ain't got nothin'\non him.\"\n\n\"I heard they had plenty.\"\n\n\"Don't worry.\" Hearne waved a hand grandiloquently. \"The boss is solid\nwith the bunch up to Baton Rouge, and they'll take care of everybody. So\nold Ben got pinched, huh? That's one joke, man!\"\n\nGramont's worst suspicions were confirmed by the attitude of Hearne, who\nplainly considered that the entire gang had nothing to fear from the\nlaw. Chacherre's boasts were backed up solidly. It was obvious to\nGramont that the ramifications of the gang extended very high up indeed.\n\n\"Better cut out the talk,\" he said, curtly, \"until we get out of here.\"\n\nHearne nodded and rolled a cigarette.\n\nWhen his hasty meal was finished Gramont paid at the counter and led the\nway outside. He motioned toward the car, and Hearne obediently climbed\nin, being evidently of so little account in the gang that he was\naccustomed to taking orders from everyone.\n\nGramont headed out of town and took the Paradis road. Before he had\ndriven a mile, however, he halted the car, climbed out, and lifted one\nside of the hood.\n\n\"Give me those rags from the bottom of the car, Hearne,\" he said,\nbriefly.\n\nThe other obeyed. As Gramont made no move to come and get them, Hearne\ngot out of the car; then Gramont rose from the engine unexpectedly, and\nHearne looked into a pistol.\n\n\"Hold out your hands behind you and turn around!\" snapped Gramont. \"No\ntalk!\"\n\nHearne sputtered an oath, but as the pistol jerked at him he obeyed the\ncommand. Gramont took the strips of cloth, which he had previously\nprepared, and bound the man's wrists.\n\n\"These are better than handcuffs,\" he commented. \"Too many slick\nindividuals can get rid of bracelets--but you'll have one man's job to\nget rid of these! Ah! a gun in your pocket, eh? Thanks.\"\n\n\"What t'ell you doin'?\" exclaimed the bewildered Hearne.\n\n\"Placing you under arrest,\" said Gramont, cheerfully.\n\n\"Here, where's your warrant? You ain't no dick----\"\n\nGramont cut short his protests with a long cloth which effectually bound\nhis lower jaw in place and precluded any further idea of talk.\n\n\"You climb into that car, Hearne,\" he ordered, \"and I'll attend to your\nfeet next. That's the boy! Nothing like taking it calmly, Hearne. You\ndidn't know that I was the fellow who pinched old Ben, did you? But I\nam. And before night your whole crowd will be hooked up, from the big\nboss down to you.\"\n\nGramont tied Dick Hearne securely, hand and foot, and then lashed him to\none of the top supports of the car. When he had finished, Hearne was\nreasonably safe. He then climbed under the wheel again and proceeded on\nhis way. Hearne's lashings were inconspicuous to any one whom the car\npassed.\n\nIt was a little after eight in the morning when Gramont drove into\nParadis. He noticed that two large automobiles were standing in front of\nthe postoffice, and that about them were a group of men who eyed him and\nhis car with some interest. Paying no attention to these, he drove on\nthrough town without a halt.\n\nSweeping out along the north road, he encountered no one. When at length\nhe reached the Ledanois farm he drove in toward the deserted house and\nparked the car among some trees, where it could not be seen from the\nroad.\n\n\"You'll have some pleasant company before long, Dicky, my lad,\" he\nobserved, cheerfully. A last inspection showed that his prisoner was\nquite secure. \"In the meantime, sit and meditate upon your sins, which I\ntrust have been many and deep. Chacherre is up for murder, and he's\ntrying to save his neck by blowing on the remainder of your gang. We may\ngive you a chance to do the same thing and corroborate his testimony.\nIt's worth thinking over, isn't it?\n\n\"Perhaps you imagine that you're safe from conviction. If so, take\ncomfort while you can--I'll chance that end of it! When Memphis Izzy\ncomes along, I'll have a nice comfortable little conversation with him.\nThen we'll all join up and go back to the city together. You get the\nidea? Well, be good!\"\n\nLeaving the car Gramont took his way toward the bank of the bayou and\nfollowed this in the direction of the adjoining property. He looked at\nthe water, a bitter smile upon his lips, and again made out the faint\niridescent sheen of oil. When he came to the rivulet which gave birth to\nthe oil he paused. He remembered the excitement that had so shaken him\nupon the discovery of this supposed seepage two days previously--he\nremembered ironically the visions it had aroused in his brain.\n\n\"Farewell, too sudden wealth!\" he murmured. \"Farewell, toil's end and\ndreams of luxury! I'm still a poor but honest workingman--but I still\nthink that there's some real oil under this land. Well, we'll see about\nthat later on, perhaps. Our company is by no means busted up yet!\"\n\nHe passed on, wondering not a little at the deft skill of Jachin Fell in\nplanting that oil; the men next door had done the work, of course.\nGramont did not attempt to delude himself with the idea that Fell had\nacted selfishly. The whole affair had been handled with a clever\nsecrecy, only in order that Fell's oil company might buy the land from\nLucie, and that Fell might use the resultant boom to make her\nfinancially secure.\n\n\"He doesn't believe there's oil here,\" reflected Gramont, \"and he's\nsincere in the belief. Where Lucie is concerned, I think the man's\nabsolutely unselfish. He'd do anything for her! And yet Jachin Fell is\nan enemy, a deadly enemy, of society! Hm--these criminals show some\nqueer streaks. You can't call a man like Fell wholly bad, not by a good\ndeal; I'll almost regret sending him to the pen--if I do!\"\n\nHe went on to an opening in the bushes which, over the low rail fence,\ngave him a clear view of the Gumberts property. There he paused, quickly\ndrew back, and gained a point whence he could see without danger of his\npresence being discovered. He settled into immobility and watched.\n\nThat Memphis Izzy himself had not yet arrived, he was fairly certain.\nNear the barn were drawn up two flivvers, and sitting in chairs on the\ncottage veranda were three men who must have come in these cars. Gramont\nhad come provided with binoculars, and got these out. He was not long in\ndiscovering that all three men on the veranda were strangers to him.\nThey, no doubt, were men in the lottery game, waiting for Gumberts to\narrive. Gramont turned his attention to the other buildings.\n\nBoth the barn and shop were open, and the buzzing thrum of machinery\nbore witness that the mechanics were hard at work upon the stolen cars.\nGramont thought of Ben Chacherre, still tied and lashed to the chair in\nhis room, and wondered what was to be found under the rear seat of Ben's\ncar. He could see the car from where he lay.\n\nThe minutes dragged interminably, and Gramont settled down to a\ncomfortable position in the grass. Would Fell come? He hoped so, but\nstrongly doubted it. Fell appeared to be merely \"the boss\" and it was\nGumberts who was actually managing the lottery swindle.\n\nNine o'clock came and passed. A third flivver came roaring into the\nopening, and Gramont leaned forward intently. Three workers came to the\ndoor of the shop. A single man left the flivver and greeted them, then\nwent on to the cottage and joined the other three on the veranda. He was\ngreeted with no excitement. The house door remained closed. The newcomer\nlighted a cigarette and sat on the steps.\n\n\"Evidently he's not Gumberts,\" thought Gramont. \"Seven of them so far,\neh? This is going to be a real job and no mistake.\"\n\nAlmost on his thought, a high-powered and noiseless car came sweeping\ndown the road and he knew at once that Memphis Izzy had arrived. He knew\nit intuitively, even before he obtained a good glimpse of the broad,\nheavy figure, and the dominating features. Memphis Izzy was far from\nhandsome, but he possessed character.\n\n\"Where's the Goog?\" As he left the car, which he had driven himself,\nGumberts lifted his voice in a bull-like roar that carried clearly to\nGramont. \"Where's Charlie the Goog?\"\n\nThe mechanics appeared hurriedly. One of them, no other than Gramont's\nfriend of the adenoidal aspect, who seemed to own the mellifluous title\nof Charlie the Goog, hastened to the side of Gumberts, and the latter\ngave him evident directions regarding some repair to the car. Then,\nturning, Memphis Izzy strode to the cottage. He nodded greetings to the\nfour men who awaited him, took a bunch of keys from his pocket, and\nopened the cottage door. All five vanished within.\n\nGramont rose. A moment previously, fever had thrilled him; the\nexcitement of the manhunt had held him trembling. Now he was cool again,\nhis fingers touching the pistol in his pocket, his eyes steady. He\nglanced at his watch, and nodded.\n\n\"It's time!\" he murmured. \"Let's hope there'll be no slip-up! All ready,\nMemphis Izzy? So am I. Let's go!\"\n\nUnhurried and openly, he advanced, making his leisurely way toward the\nbarn and shop. Charlie the Goog, who was bent over the car of Gumberts,\nwas first to discern his approach, and straightened up. Gramont waved\nhis hand in greeting. Charlie the Goog turned his head and called his\nbrethren, who came into sight, staring at Gramont.\n\nThe latter realized that if he passed them the game was won. If they\nstopped him, he bade fair to lose everything.\n\n\"Hello, boys!\" he called, cheerily, as he drew near. \"I came out on an\nerrand for the boss--got a message for Gumberts. Where is he? In the\nhouse?\"\n\nThe others nodded, plainly mistrusting him yet puzzled by his careless\nmanner and his reference to Fell.\n\n\"Sure,\" answered Charlie the Goog. \"Go right in--he's in the big front\nroom.\"\n\n\"Thanks.\"\n\nGramont continued his way, conscious that they were staring after him.\nIf there was anything phony about him, they evidently considered that\nMemphis Izzy would take care of the matter very ably.\n\nThe steps of the cottage porch creaked protestingly as Gramont ascended\nthem. Perhaps Memphis Izzy recognized an unaccustomed footstep; perhaps\nthat conversation outside had penetrated to him. Gramont entered the\nfront door into the hall, and as he did so, Gumberts opened the door on\nhis right and stood gazing at him--rather, glaring.\n\n\"Who're you?\" he demanded, roughly.\n\n\"Came out with a message from Mr. Fell,\" responded Gramont at once.\n\"Brought some orders, I should say----\"\n\nThe sixth sense of Memphis Izzy, which had carried him uncaught into a\ngrizzled age, must have flashed a warning to his crook's brain. In the\nman's eyes Gramont read a surge of suspicion, and knew that his bluff\ncould be worked no longer.\n\n\"Here's his note,\" he said, and reached into his pocket.\n\nGumberts' hand flashed down, but halted as Gramont's pistol covered him.\n\n\"Back into that room, and do it quickly,\" said Gramont, stepping\nforward. \"Quick!\"\n\nMemphis Izzy obeyed. Gramont stood in the doorway, his eyes sweeping the\nroom and the men inside. Startled, all four of them had risen and were\nstaring at him. In his other hand he produced the automatic which he had\ntaken from Dick Hearne.\n\n\"The first word from any of you gentlemen,\" he declared, \"will draw a\nshot. I'm doing all the talking here. Savvy?\"\n\nThey stood staring, paralyzed by this apparition. They had been sitting\nabout a table which was heaped with papers and with packages of money. A\nlarge safe in the wall stood open. Beside the table was a small mail\nsack, partially emptied of its contents; torn envelopes littered the\nfloor.\n\nThat this was the headquarters of at least a section of the lottery gang\nGramont saw without need of explanation.\n\n\"You're under arrest,\" said Gramont, quietly. \"The game's up, Gumberts.\nHands up, all of you! Dick Hearne has peached on the whole gang, and\nfrom the boss down you're all in for a term in stir. You with the derby!\nTake Gumberts' gun, and those of your companions, then your own; throw\n'em on the floor in the corner, and if you make the wrong kind of a\nmove, heaven help you! Step lively, there!\"\n\nOne of the men who wore a derby on the back of his head obeyed the\ncommand. All five of the men facing Gramont realized that a single shout\nwould call help from outside, but in the eyes of Gramont they read a\nstrict attention to business. It was altogether too probable that one\nman who dared arrest them alone would shoot to kill at the first false\nmove--and not even Memphis Izzy himself opened his mouth.\n\nEach man there had a revolver or pistol, and one by one the weapons\nclattered into the corner. Gumberts stood motionless, licking his thick\nlips, unuttered curses in his glaring eyes. And in that instant Gramont\nheard the porch steps creak, and caught a low, startled cry.\n\n\"Hey, boss! They's a gang comin' on the run----\"\n\nIt was Charlie the Goog, bursting in upon them in wild haste. Gramont\nstepped into the room and turned slightly, covering with one of his\nweapons the intruder, who stood aghast in the doorway as he comprehended\nthe scene.\n\nNo words passed. Staring at the five men, then at Gramont, the adenoidal\nmechanic gulped once--and like a flash acted. He ducked low, and fired\nfrom his pocket. Gramont fired at the same instant, and the heavy\nbullet, catching Charlie the Goog squarely in the chest, hurled his body\nhalf across the room.\n\nWith the shots Memphis Izzy flung himself forward in a headlong rush.\nThat desperate shot of the little mechanic had broken Gramont's right\narm above the wrist; before he could fire a second time, with the weapon\nin his left hand, Gumberts had wrested the pistol aside and was\nstruggling with him. The other four came into the m\u00c3\u00aal\u00c3\u00a9e full weight.\n\nGramont went down under a crashing blow. Over him leaped Memphis Izzy\nand rushed into the doorway--then stopped with astounding abruptness and\nlifted his arms. After him the other four followed suit. Two men,\npanting a little, stood outside the door and covered them with shotguns.\n\n\"Back up,\" they ordered, curtly. Memphis Izzy and his four friends\nobeyed.\n\n\"Tie 'em, boys,\" said Gramont, rising dizzily to his feet. \"No, I'm not\nhurt--my arm's broken, I think, but let that wait. Got the ones\noutside?\"\n\nA stamping of feet filled the hall, and other men appeared there.\n\n\"Got two of 'em, Gramont!\" responded the leader. \"The third slipped in\nhere--ah, there he is!\"\n\nPoor Charlie the Goog lay dead on the floor--a touch of heroic tragedy\nin his last desperate action; the one great action of his life,\npossibly. He had realized that it meant doom yet he had done what he\ncould.\n\n\"I think that's all,\" said Gramont. \"We've sure made a killing,\nboys--and it's a good thing you jumped in to the minute! A second later\nand they'd have done for me. Take care of that evidence, will you? Get\nthat mail sack and the letters particularly; if they've been working\ntheir lottery outside the state, it'll be a Federal matter.\"\n\nGumberts, who was being tied up with his friends, uttered a hoarse cry.\n\n\"Who are you guys? You can't do this without authority----\"\n\n\"Don't be silly, Memphis Izzy!\" said Gramont, smiling a little, then\ntwitching to the pain of his arm. \"These friends of mine are members\nwith me of the American Legion, and they've come along at my request to\nput you crooks where you belong. As for authority, you can ask and go\nhang.\n\n\"Here, boys, I've got to get out to that barn. Come along, some of you!\nWe'll get my arm tied up later. Nobody hurt out here?\"\n\n\"Not a scrap, even,\" responded the leader, with a trace of disgust. \"All\nthree of those bums were outside, and we covered 'em as we came out of\nthe brush. The one that got away did so by getting his friends between\nus and him. But you attended to him.\"\n\n\"And he attended to me likewise,\" added Gramont, not without a wince of\npain.\n\nHe led the way out to the barn, and, the others trooping in behind him,\nentered. He pointed out the car which had brought Chacherre here\npreviously, and ordered the extra seat in back opened up.\n\n\"I think there's a bundle inside,\" he said. \"What's in it, I don't\nknow----\"\n\n\"Here we are, cap.\"\n\nA bundle was produced, and opened. In it was found the aviator's costume\nwhich Gramont had worn as the Midnight Masquer, and which Chacherre had\nstolen with the loot. Wrapped among the leathern garments was an\nautomatic pistol.\n\nGramont stood aghast before this discovery, as realization of what it\nmeant broke full upon him.\n\n\"Good lord!\" he exclaimed, amazedly. \"Boys--why, it must have been Ben\nChacherre who killed Maillard! See if that pistol has been used----\"\n\nThe Midnight Masquer had fired two bullets into Maillard. Two cartridges\nwere gone from this automatic.\n\n\n\n\n                               CHAPTER XV\n\n                        _When the Heavens Fall_\n\n\nThe chief of police entered the office of Jachin Fell, high in the\nMaison Blanche building, at eight o'clock on Friday evening. Mr. Fell\nglanced up at him in surprise.\n\n\"Hello, chief! What's up?\"\n\nThe officer gazed at him in some astonishment.\n\n\"What's up? Why, I came around to see you, of course!\"\n\nJachin Fell smiled whimsically. \"To see me? Well, chief, that's good of\nyou; sit down and have a cigar, eh? What's the matter? You look rather\ntaken aback.\"\n\n\"I am,\" said the other, bluntly. \"Didn't you expect me?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Jachin Fell, halting suddenly in the act of reaching for a\ncigar and turning his keen gaze upon the chief. \"Expect you? No!\"\n\n\"It's darned queer, then! That chap Gramont called me up about ten\nminutes ago and said to get around here as quick as I could make it,\nthat you wanted to see me.\"\n\n\"Gramont!\" Jachin Fell frowned. \"Where's Ben Chacherre? Haven't you\nfound him yet?\"\n\n\"Nary a sign of him, chief.\"\n\nThe door opened, and Henry Gramont appeared, his right hand bandaged and\nin a sling.\n\n\"Good evening, gentlemen!\" he said, smiling.\n\n\"Here's Gramont now,\" exclaimed Fell. \"Did you call the chief over\nhere----\"\n\n\"I sure did,\" and Gramont came forward. \"I wanted to see you two\ngentlemen together, and so arranged it. Miss Ledanois is to be here at\nnine, Fell?\"\n\nThe little man nodded, his eyes intent upon Gramont. He noticed the\nbandaged arm.\n\n\"Yes. Have you been hurt?\"\n\n\"Slightly.\" Gramont brought up a chair across the desk from Fell, and\nsat down. He put his left hand in his breast pocket, and brought forth a\ndocument which he handed to the chief of police. \"Cast your eye over\nthat, chief, and say nothing. You're here to listen for the present.\nHere's something to cover your case, Mr. Fell.\"\n\nGramont produced his automatic from the pocket of his coat, and laid it\non the desk before him. There was a moment of startled silence. The\nofficer, looking over the paper which Gramont had handed him, seemed to\nfind it of sudden, intense interest.\n\n\"What means all this mystery and melodramatic action, Gramont?\" demanded\nJachin Fell, a slight sneer in his eyes, his voice quite toneless.\n\n\"It means,\" said Gramont, regarding him steadily, \"that you're under\narrest. I went out to the Gumberts place on Bayou Terrebonne this\nmorning, arrested Memphis Izzy Gumberts and four other men engaged in\noperating a lottery, and also arrested two mechanics who were engaged in\nworking on stolen cars. We took in, further, a gentleman by the name of\nDick Hearne; a lesser member of the gang, who is now engaged in\ndictating a confession. Just a moment, chief! I prefer to do the talking\nat present.\"\n\nThe chief of police had been about to interfere. At this, however, he\nleaned back in his chair, tapping in his hand the paper which he had\nperused. He looked very much as though in danger from a stroke of\napoplexy.\n\nGramont smiled into the steady, unfaltering eyes of Fell.\n\n\"You are next on the programme,\" he said, evenly. \"We know that you are\nat the head of an organized gang, which is not only operating a lottery\nthrough this and adjacent states, but also is conducting an immense\nbusiness in stolen automobiles. Therefore----\"\n\n\"Just one minute, please,\" said Jachin Fell. \"Do you forget, Mr.\nGramont, the affair of the Midnight Masquer? You are a very zealous\ncitizen, I have no doubt, but----\"\n\n\"I was about to add,\" struck in Gramont, \"that your pleasant friend Ben\nChacherre is charged with the murder of the sheriff of Terrebonne\nParish, in which I have clear evidence against him, having been present\nat the scene of the crime. He is also charged with the murder of Joseph\nMaillard-----\"\n\n\"What!\" From both Fell and the officer broke an exclamation of\nundisguised amazement.\n\n\"Quite true, I assure you,\" said Gramont. \"The evidence is, at least, a\ngood deal clearer than the evidence against young Maillard.\"\n\n\"My heavens!\" said Fell, staring. \"I never dreamed that Chacherre----\"\n\n\"Perhaps you didn't.\" Gramont shrugged his shoulders. \"Neither did any\none else. I imagine that Ben learned of this room and drinking party,\nand rightly decided that he could make a rich haul off a small crowd of\ndrunken young sports. He had the costume stolen from my car, as you\nknow, also the automatic which went with it. Two shots were missing from\nthe automatic when we found it in Ben's possession; and you remember the\nMasquer fired twice at the time Maillard was killed.\"\n\n\"Ah! I always said young Maillard wasn't guilty!\" exclaimed the chief.\n\n\"And your man Hammond----\" began Fell. Gramont interposed.\n\n\"You thought you had Hammond sewed up tight, didn't you? To use the\nlanguage of your favourite game, Fell, development is everything, and\nthe player who gives up a pawn for the sake of development shows that he\nis possessed of the _id\u00c3\u00a9e grande_. You took the pawn, or thought you\ndid--but I've taken the game!\n\n\"In one way, Fell, I'm very sorry to arrest you. It's going to hurt a\nmutual friend of ours. I realize that you've been trying very hard to be\nunselfish toward her, and I think that you've been perfectly sincere in\nthis respect. Nonetheless, I've only one duty in the matter, and I\npropose to carry it through to the finish.\"\n\nFell's keen eyes sparkled angrily.\n\n\"You're a very zealous citizen, young man,\" he said, softly. \"I see that\nyou've been hurt. I trust your little game did not result in\ncasualties?\"\n\nGramont nodded. \"Charlie the Goog went west. He was desperate, I fancy;\nat all events he got me in the arm, and I had to shoot him. Memphis Izzy\nhardly justified his tremendous reputation, for he yielded like a lamb.\"\n\n\"So you killed the Goog, eh?\" said Fell. \"Very zealous, Mr. Gramont! And\nI suppose that the exigencies of the case justified you, a private\ncitizen, in carrying arms and using them? Who aided you in this\nmarvellous affair?\"\n\n\"A number of friends from my post of the American Legion,\" said Gramont,\nevenly.\n\n\"Ah! This organization is going in for politics, then?\"\n\n\"Not for politics, Fell; for justice. I deputized them to assist me.\"\n\n\"Deputized!\" repeated Fell, slowly.\n\n\"Certainly.\" Gramont smiled. \"You see, this lottery business has been\ngoing on for a year or more. Some time ago, before I came to New\nOrleans, the governor of this state appointed me a special officer to\ninvestigate the matter. There is my commission, which the chief has been\nreading. It gives me a good deal of power, Fell; quite enough power to\ngather in you and your bunch.\n\n\"I might add that I have secured an abundance of evidence to prove that\nthe lottery gang, under your supervision, has extended its operations to\nadjacent states. This, as you are aware, brings the affair into Federal\nhands if necessary.\"\n\nThe chief of police looked very uneasily from Gramont to Jachin Fell,\nand back again. Fell sat erect in his chair, staring at Gramont.\n\n\"You were the original Midnight Masquer,\" said Fell in his toneless\nvoice. At this direct charge, and at Gramont's assent, the chief started\nin surprise.\n\n\"Yes. One reason was that I suspected someone in society, someone high\nup in New Orleans, to be connected with the gang; but I never dreamed\nthat you were the man, Fell. I rather suspected young Maillard. I am now\nglad to say that I was entirely wrong. You were the big boss, Fell, and\nyou're going to serve time for it.\"\n\nFell glanced at the chief, who cleared his throat as if about to speak.\nAt this moment, however, a sharp knock sounded at the door.\n\n\"Come!\" called Gramont.\n\nA man entered. It was one of Gramont's deputies, who happened also to be\na reporter from one of the morning papers of the city. He carried\nseveral sheets of paper which he laid before Gramont. He glanced at\nFell, who recognized him and exchanged a nod of greeting, then returned\nhis attention to Gramont.\n\n\"Ah!\" said the latter with satisfaction, as he examined the papers. \"So\nHearne has given up everything, has he? Does this confession implicate\nMr. Fell, here?\"\n\n\"Well, rather,\" drawled the other, cheerfully. \"And see here, cap! There\nare two more of us in the crowd and we've arranged to split the story.\nWe'd like to rush the stuff to our papers the minute you give the word,\nbecause----\"\n\n\"I know.\" Gramont returned the papers that bore the confession of\nHearne. \"You've made copies of this, of course? All right. Shoot the\nstuff in to your papers right away, if you wish.\"\n\nFell raised a hand to check the other.\n\n\"One moment, please!\" he said, his eyes boring into the newspaper man.\n\"Will you also take a message from me to the editor of your\nnewspaper--and see that it goes to the others as well?\"\n\n\"If Mr. Gramont permits, yes.\"\n\n\"Go ahead,\" said Gramont, wondering what Fell would try now. He soon\nlearned.\n\n\"Then,\" pursued Fell, evenly, \"you will kindly inform the editors of\nyour papers that, in case my name appears in connection with this\nmatter, I shall immediately institute suit for libel. No matter what Mr.\nGramont may say or do, I assure you fully that no publicity is going to\nattach to me in this matter. Neither, I may add, am I going to be\narrested. That is all, sir.\"\n\nGramont smiled. \"Take the message if you see fit, by all means,\" he\nsaid, carelessly. \"You may also take my fullest assurance that within\ntwenty minutes you will observe Mr. Fell safely in jail. That's all.\"\n\nThe newspaper man saluted and departed, grinning.\n\nGramont leaned forward, the harsh lines of his face spelling\ndetermination as he looked at Jachin Fell.\n\n\"So you won't be arrested, eh? Let's see. I know that this gang of yours\nhas influence running up into high places, and that this influence has\npower. The governor knows it also. That is why I was appointed to\ninvestigate this lottery game secretly, and in my own way. That is why,\nalso, I brought the chief of police here to-night.\"\n\nHe turned to the perturbed officer, and spoke coldly.\n\n\"Now, chief, you've seen my authority, you've heard my charges, and you\nknow they will be proved up to the hilt. Dick Hearne gave up the names\nof most of the lottery gang and their confederates; my deputies already\nwired to their various places of operation for the purpose of securing\ntheir arrest. We'll make a clean sweep.\n\n\"The same may be said of the automobile gang, although we will probably\nmiss a few of the smaller fry. What other forms of criminality the\norganization may be engaged in I can't say at this moment; but we have\nsecured quite enough evidence. Are you willing to arrest Jachin Fell, or\nnot?\"\n\nThe chief cleared his throat.\n\n\"Why, Mr. Gramont,\" he observed, nervously, \"about the rest of the gang,\nwe'll take care of 'em, sure! But it's different with Mr. Fell here.\nHe's a friend of the senator----\"\n\n\"Different, hell!\" snapped Gramont, angrily. \"He's a criminal, no matter\nwho his friends may be, and I have the proof of it!\"\n\n\"Well, that may be so,\" admitted the chief of police. \"But this thing is\ngoin' to raise one hell of a scandal, all up and down the state! You\nknow that as well as I do. Now, if I was you, I'd act kind of slow----\"\n\nGramont smiled bitterly.\n\n\"Perhaps you would, chief. In fact, I don't doubt that you would. But\nyou are not _me_. Now, as a duly-appointed officer acting under\nauthority of the governor of the state, I call upon you to arrest this\ncriminal, and I make you duly responsible for his safe-keeping. Do you\ndare refuse?\"\n\nThe chief hesitated. He looked at Fell for help, but none came. Fell\nseemed to be rather amused by the situation.\n\n\"Well,\" said the chief, \"I ain't seen the evidence yet----\"\n\n\"I'll show you some evidence of another kind, chief,\" said Gramont,\nsternly quiet. \"Outside the door, here, there are two men who will obey\nmy orders and my authority. If you dare refuse to do your duty you will\nyourself be taken from this room under arrest, on a John Doe warrant\nwhich is already prepared and waiting; and you will be charged with\nbeing an accomplice of this gang. Now choose, and choose quickly!\"\n\nGramont leaned back in his chair. The purpling features of the chief\nwere streaming with perspiration; the man was in a frightful dilemma,\nand his plight was pitiable. At this instant Jachin Fell interposed.\n\n\"Let me speak, please,\" he said, gently. \"My dear Mr. Gramont, it has\njust occurred to me that there may be a compromise----\"\n\n\"I'm not compromising,\" snapped Gramont.\n\n\"Certainly not; I speak of our mutual friend here,\" and Fell indicated\nthe chief with a bland gesture. \"I believe that Judge Forester of this\ncity is at present consulting with the governor at Baton Rouge on\npolitical matters. With them, also, is Senator Flaxman, who has come\nfrom Washington on the same errand. Now, it would be a very simple\nmatter to end all this anxiety. Suppose that you call up the governor on\nlong distance, from this telephone, and get his assurance that I am not\nto be arrested. Then you'll be convinced.\"\n\nGramont laughed with deep anger.\n\n\"You gangsters are all alike!\" he said, turning to the desk telephone.\n\"You think that because you have planted your slimy tentacles in high\nplaces you can do anything with absolute impunity. But the governor of\nthis state is not in your clutches.\n\n\"He's a man, by heaven! I have his assurance that he'll prosecute to the\nlimit whoever is behind this criminal gang--and he keeps his word! Don't\nthink that if your friend the senator is with him, you will be saved.\nI'll call him, if only to show the chief, here, that influence is not\ngoing to count in this game.\"\n\nGramont took down the receiver, called long distance, and put in a\nhurried call for the executive mansion, asking for the governor in\nperson.\n\n\"So you think that he's immune from influence, do you?\" Jachin Fell\nsmiled patronizingly and lighted a fresh cigar. The chief of police was\nmopping his brow.\n\n\"My dear Gramont, you exhibit a youthful confidence in human nature! Let\nme topple your clay-footed idol from its pedestal in a hurry. Mention to\nthe governor that you have me under arrest, and that I have asked him to\nspeak with Judge Forester and Senator Flaxman before confirming the\narrest. I'll wager you five hundred dollars----\"\n\nThe smile in Fell's pale eyes drove Gramont into a cold fury of rage.\n\n\"You devil! So your damnable influence goes as far as those two men,\ndoes it--those men who are respected above all others in this city? By\nthe lord, I'll call your bluff! I know the governor, and I know he\ndoesn't give a damn for all the dirty crooks and slimy politicians on\nearth!\"\n\n\"What sublime faith!\" laughed Fell, softly.\n\nThe telephone rang sharply. Taunted almost beyond endurance, Gramont\nseized the instrument and made answer. In a moment he had the governor\non the wire. His gaze went exultantly to Fell.\n\n\"Governor, this is Henry Gramont speaking,\" he said. \"I've just\nsucceeded in my work, as I wired you this afternoon--no, hold on a\nminute! This is important.\n\n\"The head of the entire gang is a man here in New Orleans by the name of\nJachin Fell. Yes, Fell. I find it very hard to get him arrested. Fell\nboasts that his influence is superior to any that I can bring to bear.\nHe asks that you speak with Judge Forester and Senator Flaxman before\nconfirming the arrest, and boasts that you will order me to keep hands\noff.\n\n\"Speak with them, governor! If they're in the gang, too, don't you\nworry. You confirm this arrest, and I'll put Fell behind the bars if I\nhave to turn all New Orleans inside out. Go ahead! I know that you can't\nbe reached by any of these crooks--I'm merely calling Fell's bluff. We\nhave the chief of police here, and he's sweating. Eh? Sure. Take as long\nas you like, governor.\"\n\nHe smiled grimly at Jachin Fell as he waited. Two minutes\npassed--three--four. Then he heard the voice of the governor again.\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"Don't arrest him, Gramont.\"\n\n\"What?\" Gramont gasped.\n\n\"Don't touch him, I said! Get in all the others, no matter who they are,\nbut leave Fell alone----\"\n\n\"You damned coward!\" shouted Gramont, in a heat of fury. \"So this is the\nway you keep your promises, is it? And I thought you were above all\ninfluences--real American! You're a hell of a governor--oh, I don't want\nto hear any more from you.\"\n\nHe jerked up the receiver.\n\nThere was a moment of dead silence in the room. The chief mopped his\nbrow, in evident relief. Jachin Fell sat back in his chair and\nscrutinized Gramont with his thin-lipped smile.\n\nGramont sat helpless, wrung by chagrin, rage, and impotency. There was\nnothing he could say, nothing he could do. The man behind him had failed\nhim. The entire power of the state, which had been behind him, had\nfailed him. There was no higher power to which he could appeal, except\nthe power of the Federal Government. His head jerked up sharply.\n\n\"Fell, I've got the evidence on you, and I've got the evidence to put\nthis lottery business into Federal hands. Boys! Come in here!\"\n\nAt his shout the door opened and two of his men entered. Gramont looked\nat the chief.\n\n\"You're willing to take care of all the rest of the gang, chief?\"\n\n\"Sure,\" assented the officer, promptly.\n\n\"All right. Boys, turn over the whole crowd to the chief, and I'll trust\nyou to see that they're properly booked and jailed. Turn over all the\nevidence likewise, except that mail sack. Have that brought up here, to\nthis room, and see that the corridor outside is kept guarded. Get me?\"\n\nThe two saluted. \"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"Good. Send to the Federal building, find out where there's an agent of\nthe Department of Justice, and get him here. Have him here inside of\nfifteen minutes.\"\n\nFell smiled. \"I can save you time, gentlemen. The agent in charge of\nthis district will probably be home at this hour. I can give you his\naddress----\"\n\nHe did so. In the pale eyes Gramont read an imperturbable challenge. The\neffrontery of the man appalled him. He turned to his men.\n\n\"Confirm fully that he _is_ the agent before you get him,\" he ordered,\ncurtly. \"Have him bring one of his deputy agents likewise, to meet you\nhere. That's all, chief, if you'll go along with these men, you'll be\nput in charge of our prisoners and evidence. I've left a guard at the\nGumberts place at Terrebonne, and I'd suggest that you go through the\nresidence of Gumberts here in town. You might find evidence. That's\nall.\"\n\nThe chief departed without a word. It was obvious that he was mighty\nglad to be gone. Gramont and Fell were left alone together.\n\n\"My dear Gramont, your devotion to duty is Roman in spirit,\" said Jachin\nFell, lightly. \"I really regret that circumstances so conspire to defeat\nyou! Why can't you be satisfied with bagging so many other victims? You\ncan't bag me----\"\n\n\"Can't I?\" said Gramont, taking a cigar and biting at it. He was cooler\nnow. \"By heavens, Fell, there's one thing in this country that you and\nno other man can reach with any influence, political bribery, or crooked\nconnections--and that's the Government of the United States! You can\nreach judges and senators and governors, but you can't reach the unknown\nand humble men who carry the badge of the Department of Justice!\"\n\nFell made a slight gesture.\n\n\"Human nature, my dear Gramont. It is quite true that I have not\nestablished this gang of criminals, as you call them, without taking\nproper precautions. Memphis Izzy, for instance, has influence that\nreaches far and wide. So have I. So have others in the party. I give you\nmy assurance that your Department of Justice man will not arrest me.\"\n\nGramont paled.\n\n\"If----\" He choked on the word, then touched the automatic on the desk\nbefore him. \"If he won't, Jachin Fell, I'll put a bullet through you\nmyself!\"\n\nFor the first time the pale eyes of Jachin Fell looked slightly\ntroubled.\n\n\"You'll hang if you do,\" he said, gently.\n\n\"I'll be damned if I don't!\" snapped Gramont, and put the weapon in his\nlap.\n\n\n\n\n                              CHAPTER XVI\n\n                   _The Impregnability of Mr. Fell_\n\n\nJachin Fell glanced at his watch.\n\n\"Lucie will be here at any minute now,\" he observed. \"I suppose your\nsense of duty will force you to disclose everything to her?\"\n\nGramont merely nodded, tight-lipped. A knock at the door, and one of his\nmen entered with the sack of mail they had taken as evidence.\n\n\"A lady is coming here at any moment,\" said Gramont. \"Allow her to\nenter.\"\n\nThe other saluted and departed.\n\n\"A sense of duty is a terrible thing,\" and Jachin Fell sighed. \"What\nabout the oil company? Are you going to let Miss Ledanois' fortunes go\nto wrack and ruin?\"\n\n\"Better that,\" said Gramont, \"than to have her profit come through\ncriminal money and means. She'd be the first to say so, herself. But\nI'll tell you this: I'm convinced that there is oil under the land of\nhers! If she'll agree, I'll put up what money I have against her land;\nwe'll be able to have one well drilled at least, on the chance!\"\n\n\"If it's dry,\" said Fell, \"you'll be broke.\"\n\n\"I can always get work,\" and Gramont laughed harshly.\n\nFell regarded him in silence a moment. Then: \"I think Lucie loves you,\nGramont.\"\n\nA trembling seized Gramont; a furious impulse to shoot the man down as\nhe sat. Did he have the baseness to try and save himself through Lucie?\nSomething of his stifled anger must have shone in his eyes, for Jachin\nFell laid down his cigar and continued quickly:\n\n\"Don't misunderstand. I say that I think she cares for you; it is merely\nsurmise on my part. Lucie is one person for whom I'd do anything. I\nstand and have stood in the place of a parent to her. She is very dear\nto me. I have a special reason for intruding on your personal affairs in\nthis manner, and some right to ask you in regard to your intentions.\"\n\n\"I don't recognize any right whatever on your part,\" said Gramont,\nsteadily.\n\nFell smiled. \"Ah! Then you are in love. Well, youth must be served!\"\n\n\"I'd like to know one thing,\" struck in Gramont. \"That is, why you were\nso cursed anxious to get something on my man Hammond! And why you held\nthe Midnight Masquer affair over me as a threat. Did you suspect my\nbusiness?\"\n\nFell threw back his head and laughed in a hearty amusement that was\nquite unrestrained.\n\n\"That,\" he responded, \"is really humorous! Do you know, I honestly\nthought you a fortune-hunter from Europe? When I suspected you of being\nthe Midnight Masquer, and afterward, I was convinced that you, and very\nlikely Hammond as well, were very clever swindlers of some kind. There,\nI confess, I made a grave error. My friend Gumberts never forgets faces,\nand he said to me, one day, that Hammond's face was vaguely familiar to\nhim, but he could not place the man. That led me to think----\"\n\n\"Ah!\" exclaimed Gramont. \"Gumberts saw Hammond years ago, when he was\nescaping from the law--and to think he remembered! Hammond told me about\nit.\"\n\n\"That's why I wanted you and Hammond in my gang,\" said Fell. \"I thought\nit would be very well to get you into the organization for my own\npurposes.\"\n\n\"Thanks,\" answered Gramont, drily. \"I got in, didn't I?\"\n\nWithout a knock the door opened and Lucie Ledanois entered.\n\n\"Good evening, stockholders!\" she exclaimed. \"Do you know there's a\ncrowd down in the street--policemen and automobiles and a lot of\nexcitement?\"\n\n\"Allow me,\" said Gramont, taking her coat and placing a chair for her.\n\"Oh, yes, we've had quite a strenuous evening, Miss Ledanois.\"\n\n\"Your hand! Why, what has happened?\"\n\n\"One of Mr. Fell's friends tried to shoot me. Will you sit down, please?\nYou remember that I warned you regarding a shock that would come; and\nnow I must explain.\" Gramont gravely handed her his commission from the\ngovernor, and resumed his seat. \"When I say that I have come here, not\nto attend a meeting of our oil company, but to arrest Mr. Fell, you will\nunderstand. I am very sorry, Lucie, to have to tell you all this, for I\nknow your attachment to him.\"\n\n\"Arrest--you, Uncle Jachin?\" The girl glanced from the paper to Fell,\nwho nodded. \"And you, Henry--a special officer of the governor's?\nWhy--this isn't a joke of some kind?\"\n\n\"None whatever, my dear,\" said Fell, quietly. \"Mr. Gramont is to be\ncongratulated. He has discovered that I was the head of a large\norganization of criminals. He has there, under the table, a sack of mail\nwhich proves that my organization was conducting a lottery throughout\nseveral states; we are now expecting the arrival of Federal agents, to\nwhom Gramont intends to turn me over as a prisoner.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" The girl stared at him, wide-eyed. Her voice broke. \"It--it can't\nbe true----\"\n\n\"It is quite true, my dear,\" and Jachin Fell smiled. \"But don't let it\ndistress you in the least, I beg. Here, if I mistake not, are your\nDepartment of Justice friends, Gramont.\"\n\nA knock at the door, and it opened to admit one of Gramont's men.\n\n\"Here they are, sir--the chief agent and a deputy. Shall I let them in?\"\n\nGramont nodded. Two men entered the room, and Gramont dismissed his own\nman with a gesture. He saw that the agents both nodded to Fell.\n\n\"Do you gentlemen know this man?\" he demanded, rising.\n\n\"Yes,\" said one of them, regarding him keenly. \"Who sent for us?\"\n\n\"I did.\" Gramont gave his name, and handed them his commission. \"I have\nbeen investigating a lottery which has been conducted in this state for\na long time by an organization of very clever criminals. Jachin Fell is\nthe man at the head of this organization. To-day I rounded up the entire\ngang, and procured all the evidence necessary. Under that table is a\nsack of mail proving that the lottery has been extended to other states,\nand that part of its operations have been conducted by means of the\nUnited States mails.\n\n\"The lesser members of the gang are in custody. The police department\nwill not arrest this man Fell; his influence and that of his gang is\nextensive in political fields and elsewhere. I have called up the\ngovernor, and have been told not to arrest him. I have disregarded these\nfacts, and I now call upon you to hold him in custody as a Federal\nprisoner. He has boasted to me that you will not touch him--and if you\ndon't, there's going to be a shakeup that will make history! Now go to\nit.\"\n\nThe chief agent laid Gramont's commission on the table and looked at\nJachin Fell. For an instant there was a dead silence. Then, when the\nFederal man spoke, Gramont was paralyzed.\n\n\"I'm very sorry, Mr. Gramont, to have to refuse----\"\n\n\"What!\" cried Gramont, incredulously. \"Do you dare stand there and----\"\n\n\"One moment please,\" said Fell, his quiet voice breaking in. \"It is\nquite true that I have organized all the criminals possible, Mr.\nGramont, and have put the underground lottery into a systematized form.\nI have done this by the authority of the United States, in order to\napprehend Memphis Izzy Gumberts and other men at one crack. These\ngentlemen will tell you that I am a special agent of the Department of\nJustice, employed in that capacity through the efforts of Judge Forester\nand Senator Flaxman. I regret that this had to be held so secret that\nnot even the governor himself was aware of it until this evening. The\nconflict was quite unavoidable. Not a member of that gang must become\naware of my real identity.\"\n\nFell turned to the two agents, who were smiling.\n\n\"I would suggest that you take this sack of mail, and arrange with the\nchief of police in regard to the prisoners,\" he said. \"The chief, of\ncourse, must suspect nothing.\"\n\nGramont sank into his chair, the automatic dropping from his hand. He\nwas suddenly dazed, thunderstruck. Yet he had to believe. He was dimly\naware that Lucie had gone to Jachin Fell, her arms about his neck. He\nstared from unseeing eyes.\n\nRealization smote him like a blow, numbing his brain. He saw now why the\ngovernor had conferred with Judge Forester and the senator, why he had\nbeen ordered off the trail. He saw now why Fell had preserved secrecy so\ngreat that even to the chief of police his impregnable position was\nsupposedly due to influence higher up.\n\nHe saw how Fell must have been working month after month, silently and\nterribly, to form one compact organization of the most talented\ncriminals within reach--headed by Memphis Izzy, the man who had laughed\nat the government for years! And he saw himself, furious, raging like a\nmadman----\n\nGramont dropped his head into his hands. The pain of his forgotten\nwounded arm stabbed him like a knife. He jerked his head sharply up, and\nwas aware that the agents had departed. He was alone with Lucie and\nFell, and the latter was rising and holding out his hand, smiling.\n\n\"Gramont, you got ahead of me in this deal, and I congratulate you with\nall my heart!\" said Fell, earnestly. \"Neither of us suspected the part\nplayed by the other man; but you've done the work and done it well. Will\nyou shake hands?\"\n\nGramont confusedly took the hand extended to him.\n\n\"I've been a fool,\" he said, slowly. \"I might have guessed that\nsomething unusual was----\"\n\n\"No; how could you guess?\" said Fell. \"There are three men in Baton\nRouge who know the truth, and three persons in this room. That's all,\noutside of the regular government men. I had not told even Lucie, here!\nI dared not. And I dare say nothing even now. To the underworld at large\nI will be known as the crook whom not even the government could touch;\nin days to come I may be of untold service to my country.\"\n\n\"I'm so glad!\" Lucie took Gramont's hand as Jachin Fell dropped it, and\nGramont looked down to meet her brimming eyes. \"For a moment I thought\nthat all the world had gone mad--but now----\"\n\nJachin Fell regarded them for an instant, then he quietly went to the\ndoor.\n\n\"If you will excuse me one moment,\" he said, \"I shall speak with your\nmen who are on guard, Gramont. I--ah--I will be back in a moment, as\nEliza said when she crossed the ice; and we may then discuss business.\nIf you agree, I think that your company may proceed upon the original\nlines, and we shall set to work drilling for oil without delay----\"\n\nGramont scarcely heard the words, nor did he hear the door close. He was\nstill looking into the eyes of Lucie Ledanois, and wondering if the\nmessage they held were really meant for him.\n\n\n\n\n                              CHAPTER XVII\n\n                              _Mi-Car\u00c3\u00aame_\n\n\nA nameless gentleman from the effete North was enjoying for the first\ntime the privileges of a guest card at the Chess and Checkers. In a\nsomewhat perplexed manner he approached the secretary's desk and\nobtained a cigar. Then he paused, listening to the sounds of revelry\nwhich filled the club, and which came roaring in from the city streets\noutside.\n\n\"Say!\" he addressed the secretary. \"What's this Mi-Car\u00c3\u00aame I've been\nreading about in the papers, anyhow? I thought everything was tight as a\nclam down here after Mardi Gras! It's still the Lenten season, isn't it?\nMardi Gras doesn't come more than once a year? Then what's all the\ncelebration about?\"\n\nThe secretary smiled.\n\n\"Certainly, sir, it's still Lent. But the French people have what they\ncall Mi-Car\u00c3\u00aame, or Mid-Lent, and they certainly give it a big\ncelebration! You see, it's a night halfway through Lent, when they can\nenjoy themselves to the limit--let off steam, as it were. We're having\nseveral dinner parties here in the club to-night, for the occasion.\"\n\nA slightly built little man, who had much the air of a shy clerk--had it\nnot been for his evening attire--approached the desk. He signed a check\nfor a handful of cigars, which he stowed away.\n\n\"Please provide a fresh box of the El Reys later,\" he said to the\nsecretary. \"Most of my party is here, I believe.\"\n\n\"I'll send them up, Mr. Fell,\" answered the secretary, quickly. \"Yes, I\nthink the dining room is all ready for you, sir. By the way, Mr. Gramont\nwas looking for you a moment ago--ah! Here he comes now!\"\n\nJachin Fell turned. Gramont was plunging at him, a yellow telegraph form\nin his hand, excitement in his eyes.\n\n\"Look here, Jachin! This wire just came in from Hammond--you know, I\nleft him in charge of things down at Bayou Terrebonne! Read it,\nman--read it! They've struck oil-sands at five hundred feet--and sands\nat five hundred, with these indications, mean a gusher at a thousand!\nWhere's Lucie? Have you brought her?\"\n\n\"She's upstairs. Well, well!\" Jachin Fell glanced at the telegram, and\nreturned it. \"So oil is actually found! This is certainly going to be\none big night, as Eliza said when she crossed the ice! Come along. Let's\nfind Lucie and tell her about it----\"\n\nThe two men turned away together.\n\nAfter them gazed the man from the North, not a little agape over what he\nhad chanced to hear. Before the wondering questions in his eyes the\nassiduous secretary made haste to enlighten him.\n\n\"That's Mr. Gramont, sir. They say that he used to be a real prince,\nover in France, and that he threw it up because he wanted to be an\nAmerican. Mr. Fell is having a dinner upstairs--it's Mr. Gramont's\nengagement, you know--and the Mi-Car\u00c3\u00aame ball afterward----\"\n\n\"Oh, I know, I know,\" and the man from the North sighed a little. \"I was\nreading all about that in the paper. Fell is one of the crack chess\nplayers here, isn't he?\"\n\nThe secretary smiled.\n\n\"Well, he plays a very fair game, sir--a very fair game indeed!\"\n\n                                THE END\n\n\n\n\n                             [Illustration]\n\n                         THE COUNTRY LIFE PRESS\n                           GARDEN CITY, N.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp:\/\/pglaf.org\/fundraising.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":1442,"split":"test"}
