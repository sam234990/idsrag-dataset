{"ori_id":"de79e439d0586c0af4aa95689757190b6e156c38","title":"Froudacity","context":"Froudacity\n Froudacity is split into four books, each addressing specific topics that Froude brings. Thomas begins the preface by attacking the overarching claims that Froude uses to argue against self-governance. Thomas ridicules Froude's assertion that if blacks in West Indian countries were given the right to vote, they would elect a candidate that would strip away the rights of whites due to racial animosity. He also attacks the notion that West Indian blacks harbor animosity against whites by pointing out that as many blacks owned slaves as whites, and that most people who were alive during slavery have since died.\nIn Book I Thomas addresses Froude's claims in the early portions of The English in the West Indies. Froude's tendency to state incorrect assumptions as fact is roundly assaulted. Thomas criticizes Froude for making sweeping generalizations about the condition of blacks on multiple islands without ever talking or interacting with the people he was writing about. Thomas points out that Froude comments extensively on the lifestyles of the natives of Grenada when his only experience among the natives was peering into their houses as he rode past in a carriage. Thomas attacks many other different factual inaccuracies in Froude's work.\nIn Book II Thomas begins to directly address Froude's criticism of giving colonies self-rule. When Froude claims that leaders of the reform movements \"did not complain that their affairs had been ill-managed\" Thomas spends over two dozen pages detailing the gross abuses of power and corruption that many of the appointed governors of Trinidad have participated in. Thomas also debunks Froude's claim that the reformers pushed for reform in the hope that they would be elected and allowed to draw a handsome government salary. Thomas also points out that contrary to Froude's claims the reform movement has been active for decades. Thomas finishes the second book by refuting Froude's assertion that West Indian blacks were incredibly well taken care off by \"the beneficent despotism of the English Government\"\nThe 3rd book takes up half of Froudacity. It begins with Froude alleging that there are few black intellectuals. Thomas responds by accusing the West Indian governments of suppressing blacks and noting that many black intellectuals sprang up in America shortly after Emancipation because they were integrated into society. Thomas uses the examples of Fredrick Douglass and Chief Justice William Conrad Reeves extensively in his arguments about race and intelligence. Both men are black and highly successful. Thomas uses these men as examples of successful black intellectuals, who succeeded despite racism. Thomas convincingly counters Froude's cheerful view of slavery. Thomas continues to contest Froude's multiple accusations about the results of black ruling over whites and what the ideal governance situation is for the West Indies. When Froude brings up the old stereotypes of blacks being lazy, or being cannibals or devil-worshipers, Thomas quickly counters all of the accusations. Thomas goes on to note the rising prominence of Christianity among blacks, and engages in a discussion on the limits of science and religion.\nIn the final 4th book, Thomas discusses the history of blacks instead of analyzing The English in the West Indies. Thomas discusses the history of the development slavery in America and in the West Indies. Thomas details how slave owners in the West Indies became god-parents to their slaves through the Catholic Church, and through this process developed personal relationships with slaves devoid of cruelty. The institutions of slavery developed very differently in America and the West Indies. Thomas lists the great accomplishments achieved by the \"Negro Race\", predicting that these accomplishments will continue growing. Thomas encourages \"African descendants now dispersed in various countries of the Western Hemisphere ... at sufficient peace to begin occupying themselves about matters of racial importance\".\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of West Indian Fables by James Anthony Froude\nExplained by J.

That project is sought to\nbe realized by deterring the home authorities from granting an elective\nlocal legislature, however restricted in character, to any of the\nColonies not yet enjoying such an advantage. An argument based on the\ncomposition of the inhabitants of those Colonies is confidently relied\nupon to confirm the inexorable mood of Downing Street.\n\n[6] Over-large and ever-increasing,--so runs the argument,--the African\nelement in the population of the West Indies is, from its past history\nand its actual tendencies, a standing menace to the continuance of\ncivilization and religion.  An immediate catastrophe, social,\npolitical, and moral, would most assuredly be brought about by the\ngranting of full elective rights to dependencies thus inhabited.\nEnlightened statesmanship should at once perceive the immense benefit\nthat would ultimately result from such refusal of the franchise.  The\ncardinal recommendation of that refusal is that it would avert\ndefinitively the political domination of the Blacks, which must\ninevitably be the outcome of any concession of the modicum of right so\nearnestly desired.  The exclusion of the Negro vote being inexpedient,\nif not impossible, the exercise of electoral powers by the Blacks must\nlead to their returning candidates of their own race to the local\nlegislatures, and that, too, in numbers preponderating according to the\nmajority of the Negro electors.  The Negro legislators thus supreme in\nthe councils of the Colonies would straightway proceed to pass\nvindictive and retaliatory laws against their white fellow- [7]\ncolonists.  For it is only fifty years since the White man and the\nBlack man stood in the reciprocal relations of master and slave.\nWhilst those relations subsisted, the white masters inflicted, and the\nblack slaves had to endure, the hideous atrocities that are inseparable\nfrom the system of slavery.  Since Emancipation, the enormous strides\nmade in self-advancement by the ex-slaves have only had the effect of\nprovoking a resentful uneasiness in the bosoms of the ex-masters.  The\nformer bondsmen, on their side, and like their brethren of Hayti, are\neaten up with implacable, blood-thirsty rancour against their former\nlords and owners.  The annals of Hayti form quite a cabinet of\npolitical and social object lessons which, in the eyes of British\nstatesmen, should be invaluable in showing the true method of dealing\nwith Ethiopic subjects of the Crown.  The Negro race in Hayti, in order\nto obtain and to guard what it calls its freedom, has outraged every\nhumane instinct and falsified every benevolent hope.  The slave-owners\nthere had not been a whit more cruel than slave-owners in the other\nislands.  But, in spite of this, how ferocious, how sanguinary, [8] how\nrelentless against them has the vengeance of the Blacks been in their\nhour of mastery!  A century has passed away since then, and,\nnotwithstanding that, the hatred of Whites still rankles in their\nsouls, and is cherished and yielded to as a national creed and guide of\nconduct.  Colonial administrators of the mighty British Empire, the\nlesson which History has taught and yet continues to teach you in Hayti\nas to the best mode of dealing with your Ethiopic colonists lies\npatent, blood-stained and terrible before you, and should be taken\ndefinitively to heart.  But if you are willing that Civilization and\nReligion--in short, all the highest developments of individual and\nsocial life--should at once be swept away by a desolating vandalism of\nAfrican birth; if you do not recoil from the blood-guiltiness that\nwould stain your consciences through the massacre of our\nfellow-countrymen in the West Indies, on account of their race,\ncomplexion and enlightenment; finally, if you desire those modern\nHesperides to revert into primeval jungle, horrent lairs wherein the\nBlacks, who, but a short while before, had been ostensibly civilized,\nshall be revellers, as high-priests and [9] devotees, in orgies of\ndevil-worship, cannibalism, and obeah--dare to give the franchise to\nthose West Indian Colonies, and then rue the consequences of your\ninfatuation!...\n\nAlas, if the foregoing summary of the ghastly imaginings of Mr. Froude\nwere true, in what a fool's paradise had the wisest and best amongst us\nbeen living, moving, and having our being!  Up to the date of the\nsuggestion by him as above of the alleged facts and possibilities of\nWest Indian life, we had believed (even granting the correctness of his\ngloomy account of the past and present positions of the two races) that\nto no well-thinking West Indian White, whose ancestors may have,\ninnocently or culpably, participated in the gains as well as the guilt\nof slavery, would the remembrance of its palmy days be otherwise than\none of regret.  We Negroes, on the other hand, after a lapse of time\nextending over nearly two generations, could be indebted only to\nprecarious tradition or scarcely accessible documents for any knowledge\nwe might chance upon of the sufferings endured in these Islands of the\nWest by those of our race who have gone before us.  Death, with\nundiscriminating hand, had gathered [10] in the human harvest of\nmasters and slaves alike, according to or out of the normal laws of\nnature; while Time had been letting down on the stage of our existence\ndrop-scene after drop-scene of years, to the number of something like\nfifty, which had been curtaining off the tragic incidents of the past\nfrom the peaceful activities of the present.  Being thus circumstanced,\nthought we, what rational elements of mutual hatred should now continue\nto exist in the bosoms of the two races?\n\nWith regard to the perpetual reference to Hayti, because of our oneness\nwith its inhabitants in origin and complexion, as a criterion for the\nexact forecast of our future conduct under given circumstances, this\nappeared to us, looking at actual facts, perversity gone wild in the\nmanufacture of analogies.  The founders of the Black Republic, we had\nall along understood, were not in any sense whatever equipped, as Mr.\nFroude assures us they were, when starting on their self-governing\ncareer, with the civil and intellectual advantages that had been\ntransplanted from Europe.  On the contrary, we had been taught to\nregard them as most unfortunate in the circumstances under which [11]\nthey so gloriously conquered their merited freedom.  We saw them free,\nbut perfectly illiterate barbarians, impotent to use the intellectual\nresources of which their valour had made them possessors, in the shape\nof books on the spirit and technical details of a highly developed\nnational existence.  We had learnt also, until this new interpreter of\nhistory had contradicted the accepted record, that the continued\nfailure of Hayti to realize the dreams of Toussaint was due to the\nfatal want of confidence subsisting between the fairer and darker\nsections of the inhabitants, which had its sinister and disastrous\norigin in the action of the Mulattoes in attempting to secure freedom\nfor themselves, in conjunction with the Whites, at the sacrifice of\ntheir darker-hued kinsmen.  Finally, it had been explained to us that\nthe remembrance of this abnormal treason had been underlying and\nperniciously influencing the whole course of Haytian national history.\nAll this established knowledge we are called upon to throw overboard,\nand accept the baseless assertions of this conjuror-up of inconceivable\nfables!  He calls upon us to believe that, in spite of being free,\neducated, progressive, and at peace with [12] all men, we West Indian\nBlacks, were we ever to become constitutionally dominant in our native\nislands, would emulate in savagery our Haytian fellow-Blacks who, at\nthe time of retaliating upon their actual masters, were tortured\nslaves, bleeding and rendered desperate under the oppressors' lash--and\nall this simply and merely because of the sameness of our ancestry and\nthe colour of our skin!  One would have thought that Liberia would have\nbeen a fitter standard of comparison in respect of a coloured\npopulation starting a national life, really and truly equipped with the\nrequisites and essentials of civilized existence.  But such a reference\nwould have been fatal to Mr. Froude's object: the annals of Liberia\nbeing a persistent refutation of the old pro-slavery prophecies which\nour author so feelingly rehearses.\n\nLet us revert, however, to Grenada and the newly-published \"Bow of\nUlysses,\" which had come into my hands in April, 1888.\n\nIt seemed to me, on reading that book, and deducing therefrom the\nforegoing essential summary, that a critic would have little more to\ndo, in order to effectually exorcise this negrophobic political\nhobgoblin, than to appeal to [13] impartial history, as well as to\ncommon sense, in its application to human nature in general, and to the\nactual facts of West Indian life in particular.\n\nHistory, as against the hard and fast White-master and Black-slave\ntheory so recklessly invented and confidently built upon by Mr. Froude,\nwould show incontestably--(a) that for upwards of two hundred years\nbefore the Negro Emancipation, in 1838, there had never existed in one\nof those then British Colonies, which had been originally discovered\nand settled for Spain by the great Columbus or by his successors, the\nConquistadores, any prohibition whatsoever, on the ground of race or\ncolour, against the owning of slaves by any free person possessing the\nnecessary means, and desirous of doing so; (b) that, as a consequence\nof this non-restriction, and from causes notoriously historical,\nnumbers of blacks, half-breeds, and other non-Europeans, besides such\nof them as had become possessed of their \"property\" by inheritance,\navailed themselves of this virtual license, and in course of time\nconstituted a very considerable proportion of the slave-holding section\nof those communities; (c) that these [14] dusky plantation-owners\nenjoyed and used in every possible sense the identical rights and\nprivileges which were enjoyed and used by their pure-blooded Caucasian\nbrother-slaveowners.  The above statements are attested by written\ndocuments, oral tradition, and, better still perhaps, by the living\npresence in those islands of numerous lineal representatives of those\nonce opulent and flourishing non-European planter-families.\n\nCommon sense, here stepping in, must, from the above data, deduce some\nsuch conclusions as the following.  First that, on the hypothesis that\nthe slaves who were freed in 1838--full fifty years ago--were all on an\naverage fifteen years old, those vengeful ex-slaves of to-day will be\nall men of sixty-five years of age; and, allowing for the delay in\ngetting the franchise, somewhat further advanced towards the human\nlife-term of threescore and ten years. Again, in order to organize and\ncarry out any scheme of legislative and social retaliation of the kind\nset forth in the \"Bow of Ulysses,\" there must be (which unquestionably\nthere is not) a considerable, well-educated, and very influential\nnumber surviving of those who had actually [15] been in bondage.\nMoreover, the vengeance of these people (also assuming the foregoing\nnonexistent condition) would have, in case of opportunity, to wreak\nitself far more largely and vigorously upon members of their own race\nthan upon Whites, seeing that the increase of the Blacks, as correctly\nrepresented in the \"Bow of Ulysses,\" is just as rapid as the diminution\nof the White population.  And therefore, Mr. Froude's\n\"Danger-to-the-Whites\" cry in support of his anti-reform manifesto\nwould not appear, after all, to be quite so justifiable as he possibly\nthinks.\n\nFeeling keenly that something in the shape of the foregoing programme\nmight be successfully worked up for a public defence of the maligned\npeople, I disregarded the bodily and mental obstacles that have beset\nand clouded my career during the last twelve years, and cheerfully\nundertook the task, stimulated thereto by what I thought weighty\nconsiderations.  I saw that no representative of Her Majesty's Ethiopic\nWest Indian subjects cared to come forward to perform this work in the\nmore permanent shape that I felt to be not only desirable but essential\nfor our self-vindication.  [16] I also realized the fact that the \"Bow\nof Ulysses\" was not likely to have the same ephemeral existence and\neffect as the newspaper and other periodical discussions of its\ncontents, which had poured from the press in Great Britain, the United\nStates, and very notably, of course, in all the English Colonies of the\nWestern Hemisphere.  In the West Indian papers the best writers of our\nrace had written masterly refutations, but it was clear how difficult\nthe task would be in future to procure and refer to them whenever\noccasion should require.  Such productions, however, fully satisfied\nthose qualified men of our people, because they were legitimately\nconvinced (even as I myself am convinced) that the political destinies\nof the people of colour could not run one tittle of risk from anything\nthat it pleased Mr. Froude to write or say on the subject.  But,\nmeditating further on the question, the reflection forced itself upon\nme that, beyond the mere political personages in the circle more\ndirectly addressed by Mr. Froude's volume, there were individuals whose\ninfluence or possible sympathy we could not afford to disregard, or to\nesteem lightly.  So I deemed it right and a patriotic duty to attempt\n[17] the enterprise myself, in obedience to the above stated motives.\n\nAt this point I must pause to express on behalf of the entire coloured\npopulation of the West Indies our most heartfelt acknowledgments to Mr.\nC. Salmon for the luminous and effective vindication of us, in his\nvolume on \"West Indian Confederation,\" against Mr. Froude's libels.\nThe service thus rendered by Mr. Salmon possesses a double significance\nand value in my estimation.  In the first place, as being the work of a\nEuropean of high position, quite independent of us (who testifies\nconcerning Negroes, not through having gazed at them from balconies,\ndecks of steamers, or the seats of moving carriages, but from actual\nand long personal intercourse with them, which the internal evidence of\nhis book plainly proves to have been as sympathetic as it was\nfamiliar), and, secondly, as the work of an individual entirely outside\nof our race, it has been gratefully accepted by myself as an incentive\nto self-help, on the same more formal and permanent lines, in a matter\nso important to the status which we can justly claim as a progressive,\nlaw-abiding, and self-respecting section of Her Majesty's liege\nsubjects.\n\n[18] It behoves me now to say a few words respecting this book as a\nmere literary production.\n\nAlexander Pope, who, next to Shakespeare and perhaps Butler, was the\nmost copious contributor to the current stock of English maxims, says:\n\n     \"True ease in writing comes from Art, not Chance,\n     As those move easiest who have learnt to dance.\"\n\nA whole dozen years of bodily sickness and mental tribulation have not\nbeen conducive to that regularity of practice in composition which\nalone can ensure the \"true ease\" spoken of by the poet; and therefore\nis it that my style leaves so much to be desired, and exhibits,\nperhaps, still, more to be pardoned.  Happily, a quarrel such as ours\nwith the author of \"The English in the West Indies\" cannot be finally\nor even approximately settled on the score of superior literary\ncompetency, whether of aggressor or defender.  I feel free to ignore\nwhatever verdict might be grounded on a consideration so purely\nartificial.  There ought to be enough, if not in these pages, at any\nrate in whatever else I have heretofore published, that should prove me\nnot so hopelessly stupid and wanting in [19] self-respect, as would be\nimplied by my undertaking a contest in artistic phrase-weaving with one\nwho, even among the foremost of his literary countrymen, is confessedly\na master in that craft.  The judges to whom I do submit our case are\nthose Englishmen and others whose conscience blends with their\njudgment, and who determine such questions as this on their essential\nrightness which has claim to the first and decisive consideration.  For\nmuch that is irregular in the arrangement and sequence of the\nsubject-matter, some blame fairly attaches to our assailant.  The\nerratic manner in which lie launches his injurious statements against\nthe hapless Blacks, even in the course of passages which no more led up\nto them than to any other section of mankind, is a very notable feature\nof his anti-Negro production.  As he frequently repeats, very often\nwith cynical aggravations, his charges and sinister prophecies against\nthe sable objects of his aversion, I could see no other course open to\nme than to take him up on the points whereto I demurred, exactly how,\nwhen, and where I found them.\n\nMy purpose could not be attained up without direct mention of, or\nreference to, certain public [20] employ\u00c3\u00a9s in the Colonies whose\nofficial conduct has often been the subject of criticism in the public\npress of the West Indies.  Though fully aware that such criticism has\non many occasions been much more severe than my own strictures, yet, it\nbeing possible that some special responsibility may attach to what I\nhere reproduce in a more permanent shape, I most cheerfully accept, in\nthe interests of public justice, any consequence which may result.\n\nA remark or two concerning the publication of this rejoinder.  It has\nbeen hinted to me that the issue of it has been too long delayed to\nsecure for it any attention in England, owing to the fact that the West\nIndies are but little known, and of less interest, to the generality of\nEnglish readers.  Whilst admitting, as in duty bound, the possible\ncorrectness of this forecast, and regretting the oft-recurring\nhindrances which occasioned such frequent and, sometimes, long\nsuspension of my labour; and noting, too, the additional delay caused\nthrough my unacquaintance with English publishing usages, I must,\nnotwithstanding, plead guilty to a lurking hope that some small\nfraction of Mr. Froude's readers will yet be found, [21] whose interest\nin the West Indies will be temporarily revived on behalf of this essay,\nowing to its direct bearing on Mr. Froude and his statements relative\nto these Islands, contained in his recent book of travels in them.\nThis I am led to hope will be more particularly the case when it is\nborne in mind that the rejoinder has been attempted by a member of that\nvery same race which he has, with such eloquent recklessness of all\nmoral considerations, held up to public contempt and disfavour.  In\nshort, I can scarcely permit myself to believe it possible that concern\nregarding a popular author, on his being questioned by an adverse\ncritic of however restricted powers, can be so utterly dead within a\ntwelvemonth as to be incapable of rekindling.  Mr. Froude's \"Oceana,\"\nwhich had been published long before its author voyaged to the West\nIndies, in order to treat the Queen's subjects there in the same more\nthan questionable fashion as that in which he had treated those of the\nSouthern Hemisphere, had what was in the main a formal rejoinder to its\nmisrepresentations published only three months ago in this city.  I\nventure to believe that no serious work in defence of an [22] important\ncause or community can lose much, if anything, of its intrinsic value\nthrough some delay in its issue; especially when written in the\nvindication of Truth, whose eternal principles are beyond and above the\ninfluence of time and its changes.\n\nAt any rate, this attempt to answer some of Mr. Froude's main\nallegations against the people of the West Indies cannot fail to be of\ngrave importance and lively interest to the inhabitants of those\nColonies.  In this opinion I am happy in being able to record the full\nconcurrence of a numerous and influential body of my fellow-West\nIndians, men of various races, but united in detestation of falsehood\nand injustice.\n\nJ.J.T.\n\nLONDON, June, 1889.\n\n\n\nBOOK I: INTRODUCTION\n\n[27] Like the ancient hero, one of whose warlike equipments furnishes\nthe complementary title of his book, the author of \"The English in the\nWest Indies; or, The Bow of Ulysses,\" sallied forth from his home to\nstudy, if not cities, at least men (especially black men), and their\nmanners in the British Antilles.\n\nJames Anthony Froude is, beyond any doubt whatever, a very considerable\nfigure in modern English literature.  It has, however, for some time\nceased to be a question whether his acceptability, to the extent which\nit reaches, has not been due rather to the verbal attractiveness than\nto the intrinsic value and trustworthiness of his opinions and\nteachings.  In fact, so far as a judgment can be formed from examined\nspecimens of his writings, it appears that our [28] author is the\nbond-slave of his own phrases.  To secure an artistic perfection of\nstyle, he disregards all obstacles, not only those presented by the\nrequirements of verity, but such as spring from any other kind of\nconsideration whatsoever.  The doubt may safely be entertained whether,\namong modern British men of letters, there be one of equal capability\nwho, in the interest of the happiness of his sentences, so cynically\nsacrifices what is due not only to himself as a public instructor, but\nalso to that public whom he professes to instruct.  Yet, as the too\nevident plaything of an over-permeable moral constitution, he might set\nup some plea in explanation of his ethical vagaries.  He might urge,\nfor instance, that the high culture of which his books are all so\nredolent has utterly failed to imbue him with the nil admirari\nsentiment, which Horace commends as the sole specific for making men\nhappy and keeping them so.  For, as a matter of fact, and with special\nreference to the work we have undertaken to discuss, Mr. Froude, though\ncynical in his general utterances regarding Negroes-of the male sex, be\nit noted-is, in the main, all extravagance and self-abandonment\nwhenever he [29] brings an object of his arbitrary likes or dislikes\nunder discussion.  At such times he is no observer, much less\nworshipper, of proportion in his delineations.  Thorough-paced,\nscarcely controllable, his enthusiasm for or against admits no degree\nin its expression, save and except the superlative.  Hence Mr. Froude's\nstatement of facts or description of phenomena, whenever his feelings\nare enlisted either way, must be taken with the proverbial \"grain of\nsalt\" by all when enjoying the luxury of perusing his books.  So\ncomplete is his self-identification with the sect or individual for the\ntime being engrossing his sympathy, that even their personal\nantipathies are made his own; and the hostile language, often\nexaggerated and unjust, in which those antipathies find vent, secures\nin his more chastened mode of utterance an exact reproduction none the\nless injurious because divested of grossness.\n\nOf this special phase of self-manifestation a typical instance is\nafforded at page 164, under the heading of \"Dominica,\" in a passage\nwhich at once embraces and accentuates the whole spirit and method of\nthe work.  To a eulogium of the professional skill and successful [30]\nagricultural enterprise of Dr. Nichol, a medical officer of that\nColony, with whom he became acquainted for the first time during his\nshort stay there, our author travels out of his way to tack on a\ngratuitous and pointless sneer at the educational competency of all the\nelected members of the island legislature, among whom, he tells us, the\nworthy doctor had often tried in vain to obtain a place.  His want of\nsuccess, our author informs his readers, was brought about through Dr.\nNichol \"being the only man in the Colony of superior attainments.\"\nPersons acquainted with the stormy politics of that lovely little\nisland do not require to be informed that the bitterest animosity had\nfor years been raging between Dr. Nichol and some of the elected\nmembers-a fact which our author chose characteristically to regard as\njustifying an onslaught by himself on the whole of that section of\nwhich the foes of his new friend formed a prominent part.\n\nSwayed by the above specified motives, our author also manages to see\nmuch that is, and always has been, invisible to mortal eye, and to fail\nto hear what is audible to and remarked upon by every other observer.\n\n[31] Thus we find him (p. 56) describing the Grenada Carenage as being\nsurrounded by forest trees, causing its waters to present a violet\ntint; whilst every one familiar with that locality knows that there are\nno forest trees within two miles of the object which they are so\ningeniously made to colour.  Again, and aptly illustrating the\ninfluence of his prejudices on his sense of hearing, we will notice\nsomewhat more in detail the following assertion respecting the speech\nof the gentry of Barbados:--\n\n\"The language of the Anglo-Barbadians was pure English, the voices\nwithout the smallest transatlantic intonation.\"\n\nNow it so happens that no Barbadian born and bred, be he gentle or\nsimple, can, on opening his lips, avoid the fate of Peter of Galilee\nwhen skulking from the peril of a detected nationality: \"Thy speech\nbewrayeth thee!\"  It would, however, be prudent on this point to take\nthe evidence of other Englishmen, whose testimony is above suspicion,\nseeing that they were free from the moral disturbance that affected Mr.\nFroude's auditory powers.  G. J. Chester, in his \"Transatlantic\nSketches\" (page 95), deposes as follows--\n\n[32] \"But worse, far worse than the colour, both of men and women, is\ntheir voice and accent.  Well may Coleridge enumerate among the pains\nof the West Indies, 'the yawny-drawny way in which men converse.' The\nsoft, whining drawl is simply intolerable.  Resemble the worst Northern\nStates woman's accent it may in some degree, but it has not a grain of\nits vigour.  A man tells you, 'if you can speer it, to send a beerer\nwith a bottle of bare,' and the clergyman excruciates you by praying in\nchurch, 'Speer us, good Lord.'  The English pronunciation of A and E is\nin most words transposed.  Barbados has a considerable number of\nprovincialisms of dialect.  Some of these, as the constant use of\n'Mistress' for 'Mrs.,' are interesting as archaisms, or words in use in\nthe early days of the Colony, and which have never died out of use.\nOthers are Yankeeisms or vulgarisms; others, again, such as the\nexpression 'turning cuffums,' i.e. summersets, from cuffums, a species\nof fish, seem to be of local origin.\"\n\nIn a note hereto appended, the author gives a list of English words of\npeculiar use and acceptation in Barbados.\n\n[33] To the same effect writes Anthony Trollope:\n\n\"But if the black people differ from their brethren of the other\nislands, so certainly do the white people.  One soon learns to know--a\nBim.  That is the name in which they themselves delight, and therefore,\nthough there is a sound of slang about it, I give it here. One\ncertainly soon learns to know a Bim.  The most peculiar distinction is\nin his voice.  There is always a nasal twang about it, but quite\ndistinct from the nasality of a Yankee.  The Yankee's word rings sharp\nthrough his nose; not so that of the first-class Bim. There is a soft\ndrawl about it, and the sound is seldom completely formed.  The effect\non the ear is the same as that on the hand when a man gives you his to\nshake, and instead of shaking yours, holds his own still, &c., &c.\"\n(\"The West Indies,\" p. 207).\n\nFrom the above and scores of other authoritative testimonies which\nmight have been cited to the direct contrary of our traveller's tale\nunder this head, we can plainly perceive that Mr. Froude's love is not\nonly blind, but adder-deaf as well.  We shall now contemplate him under\ncircumstances where his feelings are quite other than those of a\npartisan.\n\n\n\nBOOK I: VOYAGE OUT\n\n[34] That Mr. Froude, despite his professions to the contrary, did not\ngo out on his explorations unhampered by prejudices, seems clear enough\nfrom the following quotation:--\n\n\"There was a small black boy among us, evidently of pure blood, for his\nhair was wool and his colour black as ink.  His parents must have been\nwell-to-do, for the boy had been to Europe to be educated.  The\nofficers on board and some of the ladies played with him as they would\nplay with a monkey.  He had little more sense than a monkey, perhaps\nless, and the gestures of him grinning behind gratings and perching out\nhis long thin arms between the bars were curiously suggestive of the\noriginal from whom we are told now that all of us came.  The worst of\nit was that, being lifted above his own people, he had been taught to\ndespise them.  He was spoilt as a black and could not be made into a\nwhite, and this I found afterwards was the invariable and dangerous\nconsequence whenever a superior negro contrived to raise himself.  He\nmight do well enough himself, but his family feel their blood as\ndegradation.  His [35] children will not marry among their own people,\nand not only will no white girl marry a negro, but hardly any dowry can\nbe large enough to tempt a West Indian white to make a wife of a black\nlady.  This is one of the most sinister features in the present state\nof social life there.\"\n\nWe may safely assume that the playing of \"the officers on board and\nsome of the ladies\" with the boy, \"as they would play with a monkey,\"\nis evidently a suggestion of Mr. Froude's own soul, as well as the\nresemblance to the simian tribe which he makes out from the frolics of\nthe lad.  Verily, it requires an eye rendered more than microscopic by\nprejudice to discern the difference between the gambols of juveniles of\nany colour under similar conditions.  It is true that it might just be\nthe difference between the friskings of white lambs and the friskings\nof lambs that are not white.  That any black pupil should be taught to\ndespise his own people through being lifted above them by education,\nseems a reckless statement, and far from patriotic withal; inasmuch as\nthe education referred to here was European, and the place from which\nit was obtained presumably England.  At all events, [36] the difference\namong educated black men in deportment towards their unenlightened\nfellow-blacks, can be proved to have nothing of that cynicism which\noften marks the bearing of Englishmen in an analogous case with regard\nto their less favoured countrymen.  The statement that a black person\ncan be \"spoilt\" for such by education, whilst he cannot be made white,\nis one of the silly conceits which the worship of the skin engenders in\nill-conditioned minds.  No sympathy should be wasted on the negro\nsufferer from mortification at not being able to \"change his skin.\" The\nEthiopian of whatever shade of colour who is not satisfied with being\nsuch was never intended to be more than a mere living figure. Mr.\nFroude further confidently states that whilst a superior Negro \"might\ndo well himself,\" yet \"his family feel their blood as a degradation.\"\nIf there be some who so feel, they are indeed very much to be pitied;\nbut their sentiments are not entitled to the serious importance with\nwhich our critic has invested them.  But is it at all conceivable that\na people whose sanity has never in any way been questioned would strain\nevery nerve to secure for their offspring a [37] distinction the\nconsequence of which to themselves would be a feeling of their own\nabasement? The poor Irish peasant who toils and starves to secure for\nhis eldest son admission into the Catholic priesthood, has a far other\nfeeling than one of humiliation when contemplating that son eventually\nas the spiritual director of a congregation and parish.  Similarly, the\nlaudable ambition which, in the case of a humble Scotch matron, is\nexpressed in the wish and exertion to see her Jamie or Geordie \"wag his\npow in the pou'pit,\" produces, when realized, salutary effects in the\nwhole family connection.  These effects, which Mr. Froude would\ndoubtless allow and commend in their case, he finds it creditable to\nignore the very possibility of in the experience of people whose\ncuticle is not white.  It is, however, but bare justice to say that, as\nNegroes are by no means deficient in self-love and the tenderness of\nnatural affection, such gratifying fulfilment of a family's hopes\nexerts an elevating and, in many cases, an ennobling influence on every\none connected with the fortunate household.  Nor, from the eminently\nsympathetic nature of the African race, are the near friends of a\nfamily [38] unbenefited in a similar way.  This is true, and\ndistinctively human; but, naturally, no apologist of Negro depreciation\nwould admit the reasonableness of applying to the affairs of Negroes\nthe principles of common equity, or even of common sense.  To sum up\npractically our argument on this head, we shall suppose West Indians to\nbe called upon to imagine that the less distinguished relations\nrespectively of, say, the late Solicitor-General of Trinidad and the\npresent Chief Justice of Barbados could be otherwise than legitimately\nelated at the conspicuous position won by a member of their own\nhousehold.\n\nMr. Froude further ventures to declare, in this connection, that the\nchildren of educated coloured folk \"will not marry among their own\npeople.\"  Will he tell us, then, whom the daughters marry, or if they\never do marry at all, since he asserts, with regard to West Indian\nWhites, that \"hardly any dowry can be large enough to tempt them to\nmake a wife of a black lady\"?  Our author evidently does not feel or\ncare that the suggestion he here induces is a hideous slander against a\nlarge body of respectable people of whose affairs he is absolutely\nignorant.  Full [39] of the \"go\" imparted to his talk by a\nconsciousness of absolute license with regard to Negroes, our dignified\nnarrator makes the parenthetical assertion that no white girl (in the\nWest Indies) will \"marry a Negro.\"  But has he been informed that cases\nupon cases have occurred in those Colonies, and in very high\n\"Anglo-West Indian\" families too, where the social degradation of being\nmarried to Negroes has been avoided by the alternative of forming base\nprivate connections even with menials of that race?\n\nThe marrying of a black wife, on the other hand, by a West Indian White\nwas an event of frequent occurrence at a period in regard to which our\nhistorian seems to be culpably uninformed.  In slavery days, when all\nplanters, black and white alike, were fused in a common solidarity of\ninterests, the skin-distinction which Mr. Froude so strenuously\nadvocates, and would fain risk so much to promote, did not, so far as\nmatrimony was concerned, exist in the degree that it now does.\nSelf-interest often dictated such unions, especially on the part of\nin-coming Whites desiring to strengthen their position and to increase\ntheir influence in [40] the land of their adoption by means of\nadvantageous Creole marriages.  Love, too, sheer uncalculating love,\nimpelled not a few Whites to enter the hymeneal state with the dusky\ncaptivators of their affections.  When rich, the white planter not\nseldom paid for such gratification of his laudable impulse by accepting\nexclusion from \"Society\"--and when poor, he incurred almost invariably\nhis dismissal from employment.  Of course, in all cases of the sort the\ndispensers of such penalties were actuated by high motives which,\nnevertheless, did not stand in the way of their meeting, in the\nhouseholds of the persons thus obnoxious to punishment, the same or\neven a lower class of Ethiopic damsels, under the title of\n\"housekeeper,\" on whom they lavished a very plethora of caresses.\nPerhaps it may be wrong so to hint it, but, judging from indications in\nhis own book, our author himself would have been liable in those days\nto enthralment by the piquant charms that proved irresistible to so\nmany of his brother-Europeans.  It is almost superfluous to repeat that\nthe skin-discriminating policy induced as regards the coloured subjects\nof the Queen since the [41] abolition of slavery did not, and could\nnot, operate when coloured and white stood on the same high level as\nslave-owners and ruling potentates in the Colonies.  Of course, when\nthe administrative power passed entirely into the hands of British\nofficials, their colonial compatriots coalesced with them, and found no\nloss in being in the good books of the dominant personages.\n\nIn conclusion of our remarks upon the above extracts, it may be stated\nthat the blending of the races is not a burning question.  \"It can\nkeep,\" as Mr. Bright wittily said with regard to a subject of similar\nurgency.  Time and Nature might safely be left uninterfered with to\nwork out whatever social development of this kind is in store for the\nworld and its inhabitants.\n\n\n\nBOOK I: BARBADOS\n\n[41] Our distinguished voyager visited many of the British West Indies,\nlanding first at Barbados, his social experience whereof is set forth\nin a very agreeable account.  Our immediate business, however, is not\nwith what West Indian hospitality, especially among the well-to-do\nclasses, can and does accomplish for [42] the entertainment of\nvisitors, and particularly visitors so eminent as Mr. Froude.  We are\nconcerned with what Mr. Froude has to say concerning our dusky brethren\nand sisters in those Colonies.  We have, thus, much pleasure in being\nable at the outset to extract the following favourable verdict of his\nrespecting them--premising, at the same time, that the balcony from\nwhich Mr. Froude surveyed the teeming multitude in Bridgetown was that\nof a grand hotel at which he had, on invitation, partaken of the\nrefreshing beverage mentioned in the citation:--\n\n\"Cocktail over, and walking in the heat of the sun being a thing not to\nbe thought of, I sat for two hours in the balcony, watching the people,\nwho were as thick as bees in swarming time.  Nine-tenths of them were\npure black.  You rarely saw a white face, but still less would you see\na discontented one, imperturbable good humour and self-satisfaction\nbeing written on the features of every one.  The women struck me\nespecially.  They were smartly dressed in white calico, scrupulously\nclean, and tricked out with ribands and feathers; but their figures\nwere so good, and they carried themselves so [43] well and gracefully,\nthat although they might make themselves absurd, they could not look\nvulgar.  Like the Greek and Etruscan women, they are trained from\nchildhood to carry weights on their heads.  They are thus perfectly\nupright, and plant their feet firmly and naturally on the ground.  They\nmight serve for sculptors' models, and are well aware of it.\"\n\nRegarding the other sex, Mr. Froude says:--\n\n\"The men were active enough, driving carts, wheeling barrows, and\nselling flying-fish,\" &c.\n\nHe also speaks with candour of the entire absence of drunkenness and\nquarrelling and the agreeable prevalence of good humour and\nlight-heartedness among them.  Some critic might, on reading the above\nextract from our author's account of the men, be tempted to ask--\"But\nwhat is the meaning of that little word 'enough' occurring therein?\" We\nshould be disposed to hazard a suggestion that Mr. Froude, being\nfair-minded and loyal to truth, as far as is compatible with his\nsympathy for his hapless \"Anglo-West Indians,\" could not give an\nentirely ungrudging testimony in favour of the possible, nay probable,\nvoters by whose suffrages the supremacy of the Dark [44] Parliament\nwill be ensured, and the relapse into obeahism, devil-worship, and\nchildren-eating be inaugurated.  Nevertheless, Si sic omnia\ndixisset--if he had said all things thus!  Yes, if Mr. Froude had,\nthroughout his volume, spoken in this strain, his occasional want of\npatience and fairness with regard to our male kindred might have found\ncondonation in his even more than chivalrous appreciation of our\nwomankind.  But it has been otherwise.  So we are forced to try\nconclusions with him in the arena of his own selection--unreflecting\nspokesman that he is of British colonialism, which, we grieve to learn\nthrough Mr. Froude's pages, has, like the Bourbon family, not only\nforgotten nothing, but, unfortunately for its own peace, learnt nothing\nalso.\n\n\n\nBOOK I: ST. VINCENT\n\n[44] The following are the words in which our traveller embodies the\nmain motive and purpose of his voyage:--\n\n\"My own chief desire was to see the human inhabitants, to learn what\nthey were doing, how they were living, and what they were thinking\nabout....\"\n\n[45] But, alas, with the mercurialism of temperament in which he has\nthought proper to indulge when only Negroes and Europeans not of\n\"Anglo-West Indian\" tendencies were concerned, he jauntily threw to the\nwinds all the scruples and cautious minuteness which were essential to\nthe proper execution of his project.  At Barbados, as we have seen, he\nsatisfies himself with sitting aloft, at a balcony-window, to\ncontemplate the movements of the sable throng below, of whose\ncharacter, moral and political, he nevertheless professes to have\nbecome a trustworthy delineator.  From the above-quoted account of his\nimpressions of the external traits and deportment of the Ethiopic folk\nthus superficially gazed at, our author passes on to an analysis of\ntheir mental and moral idiosyncrasies, and other intimate matters,\nwhich the very silence of the book as to his method of ascertaining\nthem is a sufficient proof that his knowledge in their regard has not\nbeen acquired directly and at first hand.  Nor need we say that the\ngenerally adverse cast of his verdicts on what he had been at no pains\nto study for himself points to the \"hostileness\" of the witnesses whose\n[46] testimony alone has formed the basis of his conclusions.\nThroughout Mr. Froude's tour in the British Colonies his intercourse\nwas exclusively with \"Anglo-West Indians,\" whose aversion to the Blacks\nhe has himself, perhaps they would think indiscreetly, placed on\nrecord.  In no instance do we find that he condescended to visit the\nabode of any Negro, whether it was the mansion of a gentleman or the\nhut of a peasant of that race.  The whole tenor of the book indicates\nhis rigid adherence to this one-sided course, and suggests also that,\nas a traveller, Mr. Froude considers maligning on hearsay to be just as\nconvenient as reporting facts elicited by personal investigation.\nProceed we, however, to strengthen our statement regarding his\ndefinitive abandonment, and that without any apparent reason, of the\nplan he had professedly laid down for himself at starting, and failing\nwhich no trustworthy data could have been obtained concerning the\ncharacter and disposition of the people about whom he undertakes to\nthoroughly enlighten his readers.  Speaking of St. Vincent, where he\narrived immediately after leaving Barbados, our author says:--\n\n[47] \"I did not land, for the time was short, and as a beautiful\npicture the island was best seen from the deck.  The characteristics of\nthe people are the same in all the Antilles, and could be studied\nelsewhere.\"\n\nNow, it is a fact, patent and notorious, that \"the characteristics of\nthe people are\" not \"the same in all the Antilles.\"  A man of Mr.\nFroude's attainments, whose studies have made him familiar with\nethnological facts, must be aware that difference of local surroundings\nand influences does, in the course of time, inevitably create\ndifference of characteristic and deportment.  Hence there is in nearly\nevery Colony a marked dissimilarity of native qualities amongst the\nNegro inhabitants, arising not only from the causes above indicated,\nbut largely also from the great diversity of their African ancestry.\nWe might as well be told that because the nations of Europe are\ngenerally white and descended from Japhet, they could be studied one by\nthe light derived from acquaintance with another.  We venture to\ndeclare that, unless a common education from youth has been shared by\nthem, the Hamitic inhabitants of one island have very little in common\nwith [48] those of another, beyond the dusky skin and woolly hair.  In\nspeech, character, and deportment, a coloured native of Trinidad\ndiffers as much from one of Barbados as a North American black does\nfrom either, in all the above respects.\n\n\n\nBOOK I: GRENADA\n\n[48] In Grenada, the next island he arrived at, our traveller's\nprocedure with regard to the inhabitants was very similar.  There he\nlanded in the afternoon, drove three or four miles inland to dine at\nthe house of a \"gentleman who was a passing resident,\" returned in the\ndark to his ship, and started for Trinidad.  In the course of this\njourney back, however, as he sped along in the carriage, Mr. Froude\nfound opportunity to look into the people's houses along the way,\nwhere, he tells us, he \"could see and was astonished to observe signs\nof comfort, and even signs of taste--armchairs, sofas, side-boards with\ncut-glass upon them, engravings and coloured prints upon the walls.\"\nAs a result of this nocturnal examination, \u00c3\u00a0 vol d'oiseau, he has\nwritten paragraph upon paragraph about the people's character [49] and\nprospects in the island of Grenada.  To read the patronizing terms in\nwhich our historian-traveller has seen fit to comment on Grenada and\nits people, one would believe that his account is of some\nhalf-civilized, out-of-the-way region under British sway, and inhabited\nchiefly by a horde of semi-barbarian ignoramuses of African descent.\nIf the world had not by this time thoroughly assessed the intrinsic\nvalue of Mr. Froude's utterances, one who knows Grenada might have felt\ninclined to resent his causeless depreciation of the intellectual\ncapacity of its inhabitants; but considering the estimate which has\nbeen pretty generally formed of his historical judgment, Mr. Froude may\nbe dismissed, as regards Grenada and its people, with a certain degree\nof scepticism.  Such scepticism, though lost upon himself, is\nunquestionably needful to protect his readers from the hallucination\nwhich the author's singular contempt for accuracy is but too liable to\ninduce.\n\nThose who know Grenada and its affairs are perfectly familiar with the\nfact that all of its chief intellectual business, whether official\n(even in the highest degree, such as temporary [50] administration of\nthe government), legal, commercial, municipal, educational, or\njournalistic, has been for years upon years carried on by men of\ncolour.  And what, as a consequence of this fact, has the world ever\nheard in disparagement of Grenada throughout this long series of years?\nAssuredly not a syllable.  On the contrary, she has been the theme of\npraise, not only for the admirable foresight with which she avoided the\nsugar crisis, so disastrous to her sister islands, but also for the\npluck and persistence shown in sustaining herself through an\nagricultural emergency brought about by commercial reverses, whereby\nthe steady march of her sons in self-advancement was only checked for a\ntime, but never definitively arrested.  In fine, as regards every\nbranch of civilized employment pursued there, the good people of\nGrenada hold their own so well and worthily that any show of patronage,\neven from a source more entitled to confidence, would simply be a piece\nof obtrusive kindness, not acceptable to any, seeing that it is\nrequired by none.\n\n\n\nBOOK II: TRINIDAD \/ TRINIDAD AND REFORM+\n\n[53] Mr. Froude, crossing the ninety miles of the Caribbean Sea lying\nbetween Grenada and Trinidad, lands next morning in Port of Spain, the\nchief city of that \"splendid colony,\" as Governor Irving, its worst\nruler, truly calls it in his farewell message to the Legislature.\nRegarding Port of Spain in particular, Mr. Froude is positively\nexuberant in the display of the peculiar qualities that distinguish\nhim, and which we have already admitted.  Ecstatic praise and\ngroundless detraction go hand in hand, bewildering to any one not\npossessed of the key to the mystery of the art of blowing hot and cold,\nwhich Mr. Froude so startlingly exemplifies.  As it is our purpose to\nmake what he says concerning this Colony the crucial test of his\nveracity as a writer of travels, [54] and also of the value of his\njudgments respecting men and things, we shall first invite the reader's\nattention to the following extracts, with our discussion thereof:--\n\n\"On landing we found ourselves in a large foreign-looking town, Port of\nSpain having been built by French and Spaniards according to their\nnational tendencies, and especially with a view to the temperature,\nwhich is that of a forcing house, and rarely falls below 80\u00c2\u00b0.  The\nstreets are broad, and are planted with trees for shade, each house\nwhere room permits having a garden of its own, with palms and mangoes\nand coffee-plants and creepers.  Of sanitary arrangements there seemed\nto be none.  There is abundance of rain, and the gutters which run down\nby the footway are flushed almost every day.  But they are all open.\nDirt of every kind lies about freely, to be washed into them or left to\nputrify as fate shall direct\" (p. 64).\n\nLower down, on the same page, our author, luxuriating in his contempt\nfor exactitude when the character of other folk only is at stake,\ncontinues:--\"The town has between thirty and forty thousand people\nliving in it, and the [55] rain and Johnny crows between them keep off\npestilence.\"  On page 65 we have the following astounding statement\nwith respect to one of the trees in the garden in front of the house in\nwhich Mr. Froude was sojourning:--\"At the gate stood as sentinel a\ncabbage palm a hundred feet high.\"\n\nThe above quotations, in which we have elected to be content with\nindicating by typographical differences the points on which attention\nshould be mostly directed, will suffice, with any one knowing Trinidad,\nas examples of Mr. Froude's trustworthiness.  But as these are only on\nmatters of mere detail, involving no question of principle, they are\ndismissed without any further comment.  It must not be so, however,\nwith the following remarkable deliverances which occur on page 67 of\nhis too picturesque work:--\"The commonplace intrudes upon the\nimaginative.  At moments one can fancy that the world is an enchanted\nplace after all, but then comes generally an absurd awakening.  On the\nfirst night of my arrival, before we went to bed, there came an\ninvitation to me to attend a political meeting which was to be held in\na few days on the Savannah.\n\n[56] \"Trinidad is a purely Crown colony, and has escaped hitherto the\nintroduction of the election virus.  The newspapers and certain busy\ngentlemen in Port of Spain had discovered that they were living under a\n'degrading tyranny,' and they demanded a constitution.  They did not\ncomplain that their affairs had been ill-managed.  On the contrary,\nthey insisted that they were the most prosperous of the West Indian\ncolonies, and alone had a surplus in their treasury.  If this was so,\nit seemed to me that they had better let well alone. The population,\nall told, was but 170,000, less by thirty thousand than that of\nBarbados.  They were a mixed and motley assemblage of all races and\ncolours, busy each with their own affairs, and never hitherto troubling\nthemselves about politics.  But it had pleased the Home Government to\nset up the beginning of a constitution again in Jamaica; no one knew\nwhy, but so it was; and Trinidad did not choose to be behindhand.  The\nofficial appointments were valuable, and had been hitherto given away\nby the Crown.  The local popularities very naturally wished to have\nthem for themselves.  This was the [57] reality in the thing, so far as\nthere was a reality.  It was dressed up in the phrases borrowed from\nthe great English masters of the art, about privileges of manhood,\nmoral dignity, the elevating influence of the suffrage, &c., intended\nfor home consumption among the believers in the orthodox radical faith.\"\n\nThe passages which we have signalized in the above quotation, and which\noccur with more elaboration and heedless assurance on a later page,\nwill produce a feeling of wonder at the hardihood of him who not only\nconceived, but penned and dared to publish them as well, against the\ngentlemen whom we all know to be foremost in the political agitation at\nwhich Mr. Froude so flippantly sneers.  An emphatic denial may be\nopposed to his pretence that \"they did not complain that their affairs\nhad been ill-managed.\"  Why, the very gist and kernel of the whole\nagitation, set forth in print through long years of iteration, has been\nthe scandalous mismanagement of the affairs of the Colony--especially\nunder the baleful administration of Governor Irving.  The Aug\u00c3\u00aban\nStable, miscalled by him \"The Public Works Department,\" and whose\nofficials he coolly [58] fastened upon the financial vitals of that\nlong-suffering Colony, baffled even the resolute will of a Des Voeux to\ncleanse it.  Poor Sir Sanford Freeling attempted the cleansing, but\nfoundered ignominiously almost as soon as he embarked on that Herculean\nenterprise.  Sir A. E. Havelock, who came after, must be mentioned by\nthe historian of Trinidad merely as an incarnate accident in the\nsuccession of Governors to whom the destinies of that maltreated Colony\nhave been successively intrusted since the departure of Sir Arthur\nHamilton Gordon.  The present Governor of Trinidad, Sir William\nRobinson, is a man of spirit and intelligence, keenly alive to the\ngrave responsibilities resting on him as a ruler of men and moulder of\nmen's destinies.  Has he, with all his energy, his public spirit and\nindisputable devotion to the furtherance of the Colony's interests,\nbeen able to grapple successfully with the giant evil?  Has he\neffectually gained the ear of our masters in Downing Street regarding\nthe inefficiency and wastefulness of Governor Irving's pet department?\nWe presume that his success has been but very partial, for otherwise it\nis difficult to conceive the motive for [59] retaining the army of\nofficials radiating from that office, with the chief under whose\nsupervision so many architectural and other scandals have for so long\nbeen the order of the day.  The Public Works Department is costly\nenough to have been a warning to the whole of the West Indies.  It is\ntrue that the lavish squandering of the people's money by that\ndepartment has been appreciably checked since the advent of the present\nhead of the Government.  The papers no longer team with accounts, nor\nis even the humblest aesthetic sense, offended now, as formerly, with\nviews of unsightly, useless and flimsy erections, the cost of which, on\nan average, was five times more than that of good and reputable\nstructures.\n\nThis, however, has been entirely due to the personal influence of the\nGovernor.  Sir William Robinson, not being the tool, as Sir Henry\nIrving owned that he was, of the Director of Public Works, could not be\nexpected to be his accomplice or screener in the cynical waste of the\npublic funds.  Here, then, is the personal rectitude of a ruler\noperating as a safeguard to the people's interests; and we gladly\nconfess our entire agreement with [60] Mr. Froude on the subject of the\nessential qualifications of a Crown Governor.  Mr. Froude contends, and\nwe heartily coincide with him, that a ruler of high training and noble\npurposes would, as the embodiment of the administrative authority, be\nthe very best provision for the government of Colonies constituted as\nours are.  But he has also pointed out, and that in no equivocal terms,\nthat the above are far from having been indispensable qualifications\nfor the patronage of Downing Street.  He has shown that the Colonial\nOffice is, more often than otherwise, swayed in the appointment of\nColonial Governors by considerations among which the special fitness of\nthe man appointed holds but a secondary place.  On this point we have\nmuch gratification in giving Mr. Froude's own words (p. 91):--\"Among\nthe public servants of Great Britain there are persons always to be\nfound fit and willing for posts of honour and difficulty if a sincere\neffort be made to find them.  Alas! in times past we have sent persons\nto rule our Baratarias to whom Sancho Panza was a sage--troublesome\nmembers of Parliament, younger brothers of powerful families,\nimpecunious peers; favourites, [61] with backstairs influence, for whom\na provision was to be found; colonial clerks bred in the office who had\nbeen obsequious and useful!\"  Now then, applying these facts to the\npolitical history of Trinidad, with which we are more particularly\nconcerned at present, what do we find?  We find that in the person of\nSir A. H. Gordon (1867-1870) that Colony at length chanced upon a ruler\nboth competent and eager to advance her interests, not only materially,\nbut in the nobler respects that give dignity to the existence of a\ncommunity.  Of course, he was opposed--ably, strenuously, violently,\nvirulently--but the metal of which the man was composed was only fused\ninto greater firmness by being subjected to such fiery tests.  On\nleaving Trinidad, this eminent ruler left as legacies to the Colony he\nhad loved and worked for so heartily, laws that placed the persons and\nbelongings of the inhabitants beyond the reach of wanton aggression;\nthe means by which honest and laborious industry could, through\nagriculture, benefit both itself and the general revenue.  He also left\nan educational system that opened (to even the humblest) a free pathway\nto knowledge, to [62] distinction, and, if the objects of its\nbeneficence were worthy of the boon, to serviceableness to their native\ncountry.  Above all, he left peace among the jarring interests which,\nunder the badge of Englishman and of Creole, under the badge of\nCatholic and under the badge of Protestant, and so many other forms of\nsectional divergence, had too long distracted Trinidad. This he had\neffected, not by constituting himself a partisan of either section, but\nby inquiring with statesmanlike appreciation, and allowing the\nlegitimate claims of each to a certain scope of influence in the\nfurtherance of the Colony's welfare.  Hence the bitter rivalry of\njarring interests was transformed into harmonious co-operation on all\nsides, in advancing the common good of the common country.\n\nThe Colonial Office, knowing little and caring less about that noble\njewel in the British Crown, sent out as successor to so brilliant and\nsuccessful an administrator--whom?  One Sir James Robert Longden, a\ngentleman without initiative, without courage, and, above all, with a\nslavish adherence to red-tape and a clerk-like dread of compromising\nhis berth.  Having served for a long series of years in subordinate\nposts in [63] minor dependencies, the habit of being impressed and\ninfluenced by colonial magnates grew and gathered strength within him.\nSuch a ruler, of course, the serpents that had only been \"scotched, but\nnot killed,\" by the stern procedures of Governor Gordon, could wind\nround, beguile, and finally cause to fall. Measure after measure of his\npredecessor which he could in any way neutralize in the interests of\nthe colonial clique, was rendered of none effect.  In fact, he was\nsubservient to the wishes of those who had all long objected to those\nmeasures, but had not dared even to hint their objections to the\nbeneficent autocrat who had willed and given them effect for the\ngeneral welfare.  After Governor Longden came Sir Henry Turner Irving,\na personage who brought to Trinidad a reputation for all the vulgar\ncolonial prejudices which, discreditable enough in ordinary folk, are,\nin the Governor of a mixed community, nothing less than calamitous.\nMore than amply did he justify the evil reports with which rumour had\nheralded his coming.  Abler, more astute, more daring than Sir James\nLongden, who was, on the whole, only a constitutionally timid man,\nGovernor Irving threw [64] himself heart and soul into the arms of the\nSugar Interest, by whom he had been helped into his high office, and\nwhose belief he evidently shared, that sugar-growers alone should be\npossessors of the lands of the West Indies.  It would be wearisome to\ndetail the methods by which every act of Sir Arthur Gordon's to benefit\nthe whole population was cynically and systematically undone by this\nhis native-hating successor.  In short, the policy of reaction which\nSir James Longden began, found in Governor Irving not only a consistent\npromoter, but, as it were, a sinister incarnation. It is true that he\ncould not, at the bidding and on the advice of his planter-friends,\nshut up the Crown Lands of the Colony against purchasers of limited\nmeans, because they happened to be mostly natives of colour, but he\ncould annul the provision by which every Warden in the rural districts,\non the receipt of the statutory fees, had to supply a Government title\non the spot to every one who purchased any acreage of Crown Lands.\nEvery intending purchaser, therefore, whether living at Toco,\nGuayaguayare, Monos, or Icacos, the four extreme points of the Island\nof Trinidad, was compelled to go to Port of [65] Spain, forty or fifty\nmiles distant, through an almost roadless country, to compete at the\nSub-Intendant's auction sales, with every probability of being outbid\nin the end, and having his long-deposited money returned to him after\nall his pains. Lieutenant-Governor Des Voeux told the Legislature of\nTrinidad that the monstrous Excise imposts of the Colony were an\nincentive to smuggling, and he thought that the duties, licenses, &c.,\nshould be lowered in the interest of good and equitable government.\nSir Henry Turner Irving, however, besides raising the duties on\nspirituous liquors, also enacted that every distillery, however small,\nmust pay a salary to a Government official stationed within it to\nsupervise the manufacture of the spirits.  This, of course, was the\ndeath-blow to all the minor competition which had so long been\ndisturbing the peace of mind of the mighty possessors of the great\ndistilleries. Ahab was thus made glad with the vineyard of Naboth.\n\nIn the matter of official appointments, too, Governor Irving was\nconsistent in his ostentatious hostility to Creoles in general, and to\ncoloured Creoles in particular.  Of the fifty-six appointments which\nthat model Governor [66] made in 1876, only seven happened to be\nnatives and coloured, out of a population in which the latter element\nis so preponderant as to excite the fears of Mr. Froude.  In\neducational matters, though he could not with any show of sense or\ndecency re-enact the rule which excluded students of illegitimate birth\nfrom the advantages of the Royal College, he could, nevertheless,\npander to the prejudices of himself and his friends by raising the\nstandard of proficiency while reducing the limit of the age for free\nadmission to that institution--boys of African descent having shown an\nirrepressible persistency in carrying off prizes.\n\nEvery one acquainted with Trinidad politics knows very well the\nineffably low dodges and subterfuges under which the Arima Railway was\nprevented from having its terminus in the centre of that town. The\npublic was promised a saving of Eight Thousand Pounds by their\nhigh-minded Governor for a diversion of the line \"by only a few yards\"\nfrom the originally projected terminus.  In the end it was found out\nnot only that the terminus of the railway was nearly a whole mile\noutside of the town of Arima, but also that Twenty [67] Thousand Pounds\n\"Miscellaneous\" had to be paid up by the good folk of Trinidad, in\naddition to gulping down their disappointment at saving no Eight\nThousand Pounds, and having to find by bitter experience, especially in\nrainy weather, that their Governor's few yards were just his\ncharacteristic way of putting down yards which he well knew were to be\ncounted by hundreds.  Then, again, we have the so-called San Fernando\nWaterworks, an abortion, a scandal for which there is no excuse, as the\nhead of the Public Works Department went his own way despite the\nexperience of those who knew better than he, and the protests of those\nwho would have had to pay.  Seventeen Thousand Pounds represent the\namount of debt with which Governor Irving's pet department has saddled\nthe town of San Fernando for water, which half the inhabitants cannot\nget, and which few of the half who do get it dare venture to drink.\nSumma fastigia rerum secuti sumus.  If in the works that were so\nprominent before the public gaze these enormous abuses could flourish,\ndefiant of protest and opposition, what shall we think of the nooks and\ncorners of that same squandering department, which of [68] course must\nhave been mere gnats in the eyes of a Governor who had swallowed so\nmany monstrous camels!  The Governor was callous.  Trinidad was a\nbattening ground for his friends; but she had in her bosom men who were\nher friends, and the struggle began, constitutionally of course, which,\nunder the leadership of the Mayor of San Fernando, has continued up to\nnow, culminating at last in the Reform movement which Mr. Froude\ndecries, and which his pupil, Mr. S. H. Gatty, is, from what has\nappeared in the Trinidad papers, doing his \"level best\" to render\nabortive.\n\nSir Sanford Freeling, by the will and pleasure of Downing Street, was\nthe next successor, after Governor Irving, to the chief ruler-ship of\nTrinidad.  Incredible as it may sound, he was a yet more\ndisadvantageous bargain for the Colony's \u00c2\u00a34000 a year.  A better man in\nmany respects than his predecessor, he was in many more a much worse\nGovernor.  The personal affability of a man can be known only to those\nwho come into actual contact with him--the public measures of a ruler\nover a community touches it, mediately or immediately, throughout all\nits sections.  The bad boldness of [69] Governor Irving achieved much\nthat the people, especially in the outlying districts, could see and\nappreciate.  For example, he erected Rest-houses all over the remoter\nand more sparsely peopled quarters of the Colony, after the manner of\nsuch provisions in Oriental lands.  The population who came in contact\nwith these conveniences, and to whom access to them--for a\nconsideration--had never been denied, saw with their own eyes tangible\nevidence of the Governor's activity, and inferred therefrom a\nsolicitude on his part for the public welfare. Had they, however, been\ngiven a notion of the bill which had had to be paid for those frail,\nthough welcome hostelries, they would have stood aghast at the\nimbecility, or, if not logically that, the something very much worse,\nthrough which five times the actual worth of these buildings had been\nextracted from the Treasury.  Sir Sanford Freeling, on the other hand,\nwhile being no screener of jobbery and peculation, had not the strength\nof mind whereof jobbers and peculators do stand in dread.  In evidence\nof that poor ruler's infirmity of purpose, we would only cite the\ndouble fact that, whereas in 1883 he was the first to enter a practical\nprotest against the housing [70] of the diseased and destitute in the\nthen newly finished, but most leaky, House of Refuge on the St. Clair\nLands, by having the poor saturated inmates carried off in his presence\nto the Colonial Hospital, yet His Excellency was the very man who, in\nthe very next year, 1884, not only sanctioned the shooting down of\nIndian immigrants at their festival, but actually directed the use of\nbuck-shot for that purpose!  Evidently, if these two foregoing\nstatements are true, Mr. Froude must join us in thinking that a man\nwhose mind could be warped by external influences from the softest\ncommiseration for the sufferings of his kind, one year, into being the\ncold-blooded deviser of the readiest method for slaughtering unarmed\nholiday-makers, the very next year, is not the kind of ruler whom he\nand we so cordially desiderate.  We have already mentioned above how\nignominious Governor Freeling's failure was in attempting to meddle\nwith the colossal abuses of the Public Works Department.\n\nSir Arthur Elibank Havelock next had the privilege of enjoying the\nparadisaic sojourn at Queen's House, St. Ann's, as well as the four\nthousand pounds a year attached to the [71] right of occupying that\nprincely residence.  Save as a dandy, however, and the harrier of\nsubordinate officials, the writer of the annals of Trinidad may well\npass him by.  So then it may be seen what, by mere freaks of\nChance--the ruling deity at Downing Street--the administrative\nexperience of Trinidad had been from the departure of that true king in\nIsrael,--Sir Arthur Gordon, up to the visit of Mr. Froude.  First, a\nslave to red-tape, procrastination, and the caprices of pretentious\ncolonialists; next, a daring schemer, confident of the support of the\nthen dominant Sugar Interest, and regarding and treating the resources\nof the Island as free booty for his friends, sycophants, and\nfavourites; then, an old woman, garbed in male attire, having an\ninfirmity of purpose only too prone to be blown about by every wind of\ndoctrine, alternating helplessly between tenderness and truculence, the\ncharity of a Fry and the tragic atrocity of Medea. After this dismal\nruler, Trinidad, by the grace of the Colonial Office, was subjected to\nthe manipulation of an unctuous dandy.  This successor of Gordon, of\nElliot, and of Cairns, durst not oppose high-placed official\nmalfeasants, but [72] was inexorable with regard to minor delinquents.\nIn the above retrospect we have purposely omitted mentioning such\ntransient rulers as Mr. Rennie, Sir G. W. Des Voeux, and last, but by\nno means least, Sir F. Barlee, a high-minded Governor, whom death so\nsuddenly and inscrutably snatched away from the good work he had\nloyally begun.  Every one of the above temporary administrators was a\nright good man for a post in which brain power and moral back-bone are\nessential qualifications.  But the Fates so willed it that Trinidad\nshould never enjoy the permanent governance of either.  In view of the\nabove facts; in view also of the lessons taught the inhabitants of\nTrinidad so frequently, so cruelly, what wonder is there that, failing\nof faith in a probability, which stands one against four, of their\ngetting another worthy ruler when Governor Robinson shall have left\nthem, they should seek to make hay while the sun shines, by providing\nagainst the contingency of such Governors as they know from bitter\nexperience that Downing Street would place over their destinies, should\nthe considerations detailed by Mr. Froude or any other equally [73]\nunworthy counsellor supervene?  That the leading minds of Trinidad\nshould believe in an elective legislature is a logical consequence of\nthe teachings of the past, when the Colony was under the manipulation\nof the sort of Governors above mentioned as immediately succeeding Sir\nArthur Gordon.\n\nThis brings us to the motives, the sordid motives, which Mr. Froude,\noblivious of the responsibility of his high literary status, has\npermitted himself gratuitously, and we may add scandalously, to impute\nto the heads of the Reform movement in Trinidad.  It was perfectly\ncompetent that our author should decline, as he did decline, to have\nanything to do, even as a spectator, at a meeting with the object of\nwhich he had no sympathy.  But our opinion is equally decided that Mr.\nFroude has transgressed the bounds of decent political antagonism, nay,\neven of common sense, when he presumes to state that it was not for any\nother object than the large salaries of the Crown appointments, which\nthey covet for themselves, that the Reform leaders are contending.\nThis is not criticism: it is slander. To make culpatory statements\nagainst others, [74] without ability to prove them, is, to say the\nleast, hazardous; but to make accusations to formulate which the\naccuser is forced, not only to ignore facts, but actually to deny them,\nis, to our mind, nothing short of rank defamation.\n\nMr. Froude is not likely to impress the world (of the West Indies, at\nany rate) with the transparently silly, if not intentionally malicious,\nravings which he has indulged in on the subject of Trinidad and its\npolitics.  Here are some of the things which this \"champion of\nAnglo-West Indians\" attempts to force down the throats of his readers.\nHe would have us believe that Mr. Francis Damian, the Mayor of Port of\nSpain, and one of the wealthiest of the native inhabitants of Trinidad,\na man who has retired from an honourable and lucrative legal practice,\nand devotes his time, his talents, and his money to the service of his\nnative country; that Mr. Robert Guppy, the venerable and venerated\nMayor of San Fernando, with his weight of years and his sufficing\ncompetence, and with his long record of self-denying services to the\npublic; that Mr. George Goodwille, one of the most successful merchants\nin the Colonies; that Mr. Conrad [75] F. Stollmeyer, a gentleman\nretired, in the evening of his days, on his well-earned ample means,\nare open to the above sordid accusation.  In short, that those and\nsuch-like individuals who, on account of their private resources and\nmental capabilities, as well as the public influence resulting\ntherefrom, are, by the sheer logic of circumstances, forced to be at\nthe head of public movements, are actuated by a craving for the few\nhundred pounds a year for which there is such a scramble at Downing\nStreet among the future official grandees of the West Indies!  But\ngranting that this allegation of Mr. Froude's was not as baseless as we\nhave shown it to be, and that the leaders of the Reform agitation were\nimpelled by the desire which our author seeks to discredit them with,\nwhat then?  Have they who have borne the heat and the burden of the day\nin making the Colonies what they are no right to the enjoyment of the\nfruits of their labours?  The local knowledge, the confidence and\nrespect of the population, which such men enjoy, and can wield for good\nor evil in the community, are these matters of small account in the\nefficient government of the Colony?  Our author, in [76] specifying the\nimmunities of his ideal Governor, who is also ours, recommends, amongst\nother things, that His Excellency should be allowed to choose his own\nadvisers.  By this Mr. Froude certainly does not mean that the advisers\nso chosen must be all pure-blooded Englishmen who have rushed from the\ndestitution of home to batten on the cheaply obtained flesh-pots of the\nColonies.\n\nAt any rate, whatever political fate Mr. Froude may desire for the\nColonies in general, and for Trinidad in particular, it is nevertheless\nunquestionable that he and the scheme that he may have for our future\ngovernance, in this year of grace 1888, have both come into view\nentirely out of season.  The spirit of the times has rendered\nimpossible any further toleration of the arrogance which is based on\nhistorical self-glorification.  The gentlemen of Trinidad, who are\nstruggling for political enfranchisement, are not likely to heed,\nexcept as a matter for indignant contempt, the obtrusion by our author\nof his opinion that \"they had best let well alone.\"  On his own\nshowing, the persons appointed to supreme authority in the Colonies\nare, more usually than not, entirely unfit for [77] holding any\nresponsible position whatever over their fellows.  Now, can it be\ndoubted that less care, less scruple, less consideration, would be\nexercised in the choice of the satellites appointed to revolve, in\nthese far-off latitudes, around the central luminaries?  Have we not\nfound, are we not still finding every day, that the\nbrain-dizziness--Xenophon calls it kephalalgeia+--induced by sudden\npromotion has transformed the abject suppliants at the Downing Street\nbackstairs into the arrogant defiers of the opinions, and violators of\nthe rights, of the populations whose subjection to the British Crown\nalone could have rendered possible the elevation of such folk and their\nimpunity in malfeasance?  The cup of loyal forbearance reached the\noverflowing point since the trickstering days of Governor Irving, and\nit is useless now to believe in the possibility of a return of the\nleading minds of Trinidad to a tame acquiescence as regards the\nprobabilities of their government according to the Crown system.  Mr.\nFroude's own remarks point out definitely enough that a community so\ngoverned is absolutely at the mercy, for good or for evil, of the man\nwho happens to be invested with [78] the supreme authority.  He has\nalso shown that in our case that supreme authority is very often\ndisastrously entrusted.  Yet has he nothing but sneers for the efforts\nof those who strive to be emancipated from liability to such\nsubjection.  Mr. Froude's deftly-worded sarcasms about \"degrading\ntyranny,\" \"the dignity of manhood,\" &c., are powerless to alter the\nfacts.  Crown Colony Government--denying, as it does to even the wisest\nand most interested in a community cursed with it all participation in\nthe conduct of their own affairs, while investing irresponsible and\nuninterested \"birds of passage\" (as our author aptly describes them)\nwith the right of making ducks and drakes of the resources wrung from\nthe inhabitants--is a degrading tyranny, which the sneers of Mr. Froude\ncannot make otherwise.  The dignity of manhood, on the other hand, we\nare forced to admit, runs scanty chance of recognition by any being,\nhowever masculine his name, who could perpetrate such a literary and\nmoral scandal as \"The Bow of Ulysses.\"  Yet the dignity of manhood\nstands venerable there, and whilst the world lasts shall gain for its\npossessors the right of record on the roll of [79] those whom the\nworthy of the world delight to honour.\n\nAll of a piece, as regards veracity and prudence, is the further\nallegation of Mr. Froude's, to the effect that there was never any\nagitation for Reform in Trinidad before that which he passes under\nreview.  It is, however, a melancholy fact, which we are ashamed to\nstate, that Mr. Froude has written characteristically here also, either\nthrough crass ignorance or through deliberate malice.  Any respectable,\nwell-informed inhabitant of Trinidad, who happened not to be an\nofficial \"bird of passage,\" might, on our author's honest inquiry, have\ninformed him that Trinidad is the land of chronic agitation for Reform.\nMr. Froude might also have been informed that, even forty-five years\nago, that is in 1843, an elective constitution, with all the electoral\ndistricts duly marked out, was formulated and transmitted by the\nleading inhabitants of Trinidad to the then Secretary of State for the\nColonies.  He might also have learnt that on every occasion that any of\nthe shady Governors, whom he has so well depicted, manifested any\nexcess of his undesirable qualities, there has been a movement [80]\namong the educated people in behalf of changing their country's\npolitical condition.\n\nWe close this part of our review by reiterating our conviction that,\ncome what will, the Crown Colony system, as at present managed, is\ndoomed.  Britain may, in deference to the alleged wishes of her\nimpalpable \"Anglo-West Indians\"--whose existence rests on the authority\nof Mr. Froude alone--deny to Trinidad and other Colonies even the small\nmodicum prayed for of autonomy, but in doing so the Mother Country will\nhave to sternly revise her present methods of selecting and appointing\nGovernors.  As to the subordinate lot, they will have to be worth their\nsalt when there is at the head of the Government a man who is truly\ndeserving of his.\n\nNOTES\n\n53. +It is not clear from the original text exactly where the brief\nchapter \"Trinidad\" ends and where the longer one entitled \"Reform in\nTrinidad\" begins.  (The copy indicates that the \"Trinidad\" chapter ends\nat page 54, but the relevant page contains no subheading.)  I have,\ntherefore, chosen to fuse the two chapters since they form a logical\nunit.\n\n77. +Since there is little Greek in this work, I have simply\ntransliterated it.\n\n\n\nBOOK II: NEGRO FELICITY IN THE WEST INDIES\n\n[81] We come now to the ingenious and novel fashion in which Mr. Froude\ncarries out his investigations among the black population, and to his\ndogmatic conclusions concerning them.  He says:--\n\n\"In Trinidad, as everywhere else, my own chief desire was to see the\nhuman inhabitants, to learn what they were doing, how they were living,\nand what they were thinking about, and this could best be done by\ndrives about the town and neighbourhood.\"\n\n\"Drives about the town and neighbourhood,\" indeed!  To learn and be\nable to depict with faithful accuracy what people \"were doing, how they\nwere living, and what they were thinking about\"--all this being best\ndone (domestic circumstances, nay, soul-workings and all!) through\nfleeting glimpses of shifting [82] panoramas of intelligent human\nbeings!  What a bright notion!  We have here the suggestion of a\ncapacity too superhuman to be accepted on trust, especially when, as in\nthis case, it is by implication self-arrogated.  The modesty of this\nthaumaturgic traveller in confining the execution of his detailed\nscrutiny of a whole community to the moderate progression of some\nconventional vehicle, drawn by some conventional quadruped or the\nother, does injustice to powers which, if possessed at all, might have\ncompassed the same achievement in the swifter transit of an express\ntrain, or, better still perhaps, from the empyrean elevation of a\nballoon!  Yet is Mr. Froude confident that data professed to be thus\ncollected would easily pass muster with the readers of his book! A\nconfidence of this kind is abnormal, and illustrates, we think most\nfully, all the special characteristics of the man.  With his passion\nfor repeating, our author tells us in continuation of a strange\nrhapsody on Negro felicity:--\n\n\"Once more, the earth does not contain any peasantry so well off, so\nwell-cared for, so happy, so sleek and contented, as the sons [83] and\ndaughters of the emancipated slaves in the English West Indian Islands.\"\n\nAgain:--\n\n\"Under the rule of England, in these islands, the two millions of these\nbrothers-in-law of ours are the most perfectly contented specimens of\nthe human race to be found upon the planet.... If happiness be the\nsatisfaction of every conscious desire, theirs is a condition that\nadmits of no improvement: were they independent, they might quarrel\namong themselves, and the weaker become the bondsmen of the stronger;\nunder the beneficent despotism of the English Government, which knows\nno difference of colour and permits no oppression, they can sleep,\nlounge, and laugh away their lives as they please, fearing no danger,\"\n&c.\n\nNow, then, let us examine for a while this roseate picture of Arcadian\nblissfulness said to be enjoyed by British West Indian Negroes in\ngeneral, and by the Negroes of Trinidad in particular. \"No distinction\nof colour\" under the British rule, and, better still, absolute\nprotection of the weaker against the stronger!  This latter\nconsummation especially, [84] Mr. Froude tells us, has been happily\nsecured \"under the beneficent despotism\" of the Crown Colony system.\nHowever, let the above vague hyperboles be submitted to the test of\npractical experience, and the abstract government analysed in its\nconcrete relations with the people.\n\nUnquestionably the actual and direct interposition of the shielding\nauthority above referred to, between man and man, is the immediate\nprovince of the MAGISTRACY.  All other branches of the Government,\nhaving in themselves no coercive power, must, from the supreme\nexecutive downwards, in cases of irreconcilable clashing of interests,\nhave ultimate recourse to the magisterial jurisdiction. Putting aside,\nthen, whatever culpable remissness may have been manifested by\nmagistrates in favour of powerful malfeasants, we would submit that the\nfact of stipendiary justices converting the tremendous, far-reaching\npowers which they wield into an engine of systematic oppression, ought\nto dim by many a shade the glowing lustre of Mr. Froude's encomiums.\nFacts, authentic and notorious, might be adduced in hundreds,\nespecially with respect to [85] the Port of Spain and San Fernando\nmagistracies (both of which, since the administration of Sir J. R.\nLongden, have been exclusively the prizes of briefless English\nbarristers*), to prove that these gentry, far from being bulwarks to\nthe weaker as against the stronger, have, in their own persons, been\nthe direst scourges that the poor, particularly when coloured, have\nbeen afflicted by in aggravation of the difficulties of their lot.\nOnly typical examples can here be given out of hundreds upon hundreds\nwhich might easily be cited and proved against the incumbents of the\nabovementioned chief stipendiary magistracies.  One such example was a\nmatter of everyday discussion at the time of Mr. Froude's visit.  The\ninhabitants were even backed in their complaints by the Governor, who\nhad, in response to their cry of distress, forwarded their prayer [86]\nto the home authorities for relief from the hard treatment which they\nalleged themselves to be suffering at the hands of the then magistrate.\nOur allusion here is to the chief town, Port of Spain, the magistracy\nof which embraces also the surrounding districts, containing a total\npopulation of between 60,000 and 70,000 souls.  Mr. R. D. Mayne filled\nthis responsible office during the latter years of Sir J. R. Longden's\ngovernorship.  He was reputed, soon after his arrival, to have\nannounced from the bench that in every case he would take the word of a\nconstable in preference to the testimony of any one else.  The\nBarbadian rowdies who then formed the major part of the constabulary of\nTrinidad, and whose bitter hatred of the older residents had been not\nonly plainly expressed, but often brutally exemplified, rejoiced in the\nopportunity thus afforded for giving effect to their truculent\nsentiments.  At that time the bulk of the immigrants from Barbados were\nhabitual offenders whom the Government there had provided with a free\npassage to wherever they elected to betake themselves.  The more\nintelligent of the men flocked to the Trinidad [87] police ranks, into\nwhich they were admitted generally without much inquiry into their\nantecedents.  On this account they were shunned by the decent\ninhabitants, a course which they repaid with savage animosity.\nPerjuries the most atrocious and crushing, especially to the\nrespectable poor, became the order of the day.  Hundreds of innocent\npersons were committed to gaol and the infamy of convict servitude,\nwithout the possibility of escape from, or even mitigation of, their\nignominious doom.  A respectable woman (a native of Barbados, too, who\nin the time of the first immigration of the better sort of her\ncompatriots had made Trinidad her home) was one of the first victims of\nthis iniquitous state of affairs.\n\nThe class of people to which she belonged was noted as orderly,\nindustrious and law-abiding, and, being so, it had identified itself\nentirely with the natives of the land of its adoption.  This fact alone\nwas sufficient to involve these immigrants in the same lot of\npersecution which their newly arrived countrymen had organized and were\ncarrying out against the Trinidadians proper.  It happened that, on the\noccasion to which we wish particularly [88] to refer, the woman in\nquestion was at home, engaged in her usual occupation of ironing for\nher honest livelihood.  Suddenly she heard a heavy blow in the street\nbefore her door, and almost simultaneously a loud scream, which, on\nlooking hastily out, she perceived to be the cry of a boy of some ten\nor twelve years of age, who had been violently struck with the fist by\nanother youth of larger size and evidently his senior in age.  The\nsmaller fellow had laid fast hold of his antagonist by the collar, and\nwould not let go, despite the blows which, to extricate himself and in\nretaliation of the puny buffets of his youthful detainer, he \"showered\nthick as wintry rain.\"\n\nThe woman, seeing the posture of affairs, shouted to the combatants to\ndesist, but to no purpose, rage and absorption in their wrathful\noccupation having deafened both to all external sounds.  Seized with\npity for the younger lad, who was getting so mercilessly the worst of\nit, the woman, hastily throwing a shawl over her shoulders, sprang into\nthe street and rushed between the juvenile belligerents. Dexterously\nextricating the hand of the little fellow from the collar of his\nantagonist, she hurried the former [89] into her gateway, shouting out\nto him at the same time to fasten the door on the inside.  This the\nlittle fellow did, and no doubt gladly, as this surcease from actual\nconflict, short though it was, must have afforded space for the natural\ninstinct of self-preservation to reassert itself.  Hereupon the elder\nof the two lads, like a tiger robbed of his prey, sprang furiously to\nthe gate, and began to use frantic efforts to force an entrance.\nPerceiving this, the woman (who meanwhile had not been idle with\nearnest dissuasions and remonstrances, which had all proved futile)\npulled the irate youngster back, and interposed her body between him\nand the gate, warding him off with her hands every time that he rushed\nforward to renew the assault.  At length a Barbadian policeman hove in\nsight, and was hastily beckoned to by the poor ironer, who, by this\ntime, had nearly come to the end of her strength.  The uniformed \"Bim\"\nwas soon on the spot; but, without asking or waiting to hear the cause\nof the disturbance, he shouted to the volunteer peacemaker, \"I see you\nare fighting: you are my prisoner!\"  Saying this, he clutched the poor\nthunderstruck creature by the wrist, and there [90] and then set about\nhurrying her off towards the police station.  It happened, however,\nthat the whole affair had occurred in the sight of a gentleman of\nwell-known integrity.  He, seated at a window overlooking the street,\nhad witnessed the whole squabble, from its beginning in words to its\nculmination in blows; so, seeing that the woman was most unjustly\narrested, he went out and explained the circumstances to the guardian\nof order.  But to no purpose; the poor creature was taken to the\nstation, accompanied by the gentleman, who most properly volunteered\nthat neighbourly turn.  There she was charged with \"obstructing the\npoliceman in the lawful execution of his duty.\"  She was let out on\nbail, and next day appeared to answer the charge.\n\nMr. Mayne, the magistrate, presided.  The constable told his tale\nwithout any material deviation from the truth, probably confident, from\nprevious experience, that his accusation was sufficient to secure a\nconviction.  On the defendant's behalf, the gentleman referred to, who\nwas well known to the magistrate himself, was called, and he related\nthe facts as we have above given them.  Even Mr. Mayne [91] could see\nno proof of the information, and this he confessed in the following\nqualified judgment:--\n\n\"You are indeed very lucky, my good woman, that the constable has\nfailed to prove his case against you; otherwise you would have been\nsent to hard labour, as the ordinance provides, without the option of a\nfine.  But as the case stands, you must pay a fine of \u00c2\u00a32\"!!!\n\nComment on this worse than scandalous decision would be superfluous.\n\nAnother typical case, illustrative of the truth of Mr. Froude's boast\nof the eminent fair play, nay, even the stout protection, that Negroes,\nand generally, \"the weaker,\" have been wont to receive from British\nmagistrates, may be related.\n\nAn honest, hard-working couple, living in one of the outlying\ndistricts, cultivated a plot of ground, upon the produce of which they\ndepended for their livelihood.  After a time these worthy folk, on\ngetting to their holding in the morning, used to find exasperating\nevidence of the plunder overnight of their marketable provisions.\nDetermined to discover the depredator, they concealed themselves [92]\nin the garden late one night, and awaited the result.  By that means\nthey succeeded in capturing the thief, a female, who, not suspecting\ntheir presence, had entered the garden, dug out some of the provisions,\nand was about to make off with her booty.  In spite of desperate\nresistance, she was taken to the police station and there duly charged\nwith larceny.  Meanwhile her son, on hearing of his mother's\nincarceration, hastened to find her in her cell, and, after briefly\nconsulting with her, he decided on entering a countercharge of assault\nand battery against both her captors. Whether or not this bold\nproceeding was prompted by the knowledge that the dispensing of justice\nin the magistrate's court was a mere game of cross-purposes, a cynical\ndisregard of common sense and elementary equity, we cannot say; but the\nultimate result fully justified this abnormal hardihood of filial\nchampionship.\n\nOn the day of the trial, the magistrate heard the evidence on both\nsides, the case of larceny having been gone into first.  For her\ndefence, the accused confined herself to simple denials of the\nallegations against her, at the [93] same time entertaining the court\nwith a lachrymose harangue about her rough treatment at the hands of\nthe accusing parties.  Finally, the decision of the magistrate was:\nthat the prisoner be discharged, and the plundered goods restored to\nher; and, as to the countercharge, that the husband and wife be\nimprisoned, the former for three and the latter for two months, with\nhard labour!  When we add that there was, at that time, no Governor or\nChief Justice accessible to the poorer and less intelligent classes, as\nis now the case (Sir Henry T. Irving and Sir Joseph Needham having been\nrespectively superseded by Sir William Robinson and Sir John Gorrie),\none can imagine what scope there was for similar exhibitions of the\nprotecting energy of British rule.\n\nAs we have already said, during Mr. Froude's sojourn in Trinidad the\n\"sleek, happy, and contented\" people, whose condition \"admitted of no\nimprovement,\" were yet groaning in bitter sorrow, nay, in absolute\ndespair, under the crushing weight of such magisterial decisions as\nthose which I have just recorded.  Let me add two more [94] typical\ncases which occurred during Mr. Mayne's tenure of office in the island.\n\nL. B. was a member of one of those brawling sisterhoods that frequently\ndisturbed the peace of the town of Port of Spain.  She had a \"pal\" or\nintimate chum familiarly known as \"Lady,\" who staunchly stood by her in\nall the squabbles that occurred with their adversaries.  One particular\nnight, the police were called to a street in the east of the town, in\nconsequence of an affray between some women of the sort referred to.\nArriving on the spot, they found the fight already over, but a war of\nwords was still proceeding among the late combatants, of whom the\naforesaid \"Lady\" was one of the most conspicuous.  A list was duly made\nout of the parties found so engaged, and it included the name of L. B.,\nwho happened not to be there, or even in Port of Spain at all, she\nhaving some days before gone into the country to spend a little time\nwith some relatives. The inserting of her name was an inferential\nmistake on the part of the police, arising from the presence of \"Lady\"\nat the brawl, she being well known by them to be the inseparable ally\nof L. B. on such occasions.\n\n[95] It was not unnatural that in the obscurity they should have\nconcluded that the latter was present with her altera ego, when in\nreality she was not there.\n\nThe participants in the brawl were charged at the station, and\nsummonses, including one to L. B., were duly issued.  On her return to\nPort of Spain a day or two after the occurrence, the wrongly\nincriminated woman received from the landlady her key, along with the\nmagisterial summons that had resulted from the error of the constables.\nThe day of the trial came on, and L. B. stood before Mr. Mayne, strong\nin her innocence, and supported by the sworn testimony of her landlady\nas well as of her uncle from the country, with whom and with his family\nshe had been uninterruptedly staying up to one or two days after the\noccurrence in which she had been thus implicated. The evidence of the\nold lady, who, like thousands of her advanced age in the Colony, had\nnever even once had occasion to be present in any court of justice, was\nto the following effect: That the defendant, who was a tenant of hers,\nhad, on a certain morning (naming days before the affray occurred),\n[96] come up to her door well dressed, and followed by a porter\ncarrying her luggage.  L. B., she continued, then handed her the key of\nthe apartment, informing her at the same time that she was going for\nsome days into the country to her relatives, for a change, and\nrequesting also that the witness should on no account deliver the key\nto any person who should ask for it during her absence.  This witness\nfurther deposed to receiving the summons from the police, which she\nplaced along with the key for delivery to L. B. on the latter's return\nhome.\n\nThe testimony of the uncle was also decisively corroborative of that of\nthe preceding witness, as to the absence from Port of Spain of L. B.\nduring the days embraced in the defence.  The alibi was therefore\nunquestionably made out, especially as none of the police witnesses\nwould venture to swear to having actually seen L. B. at the brawl. The\nmagistrate had no alternative but that of acquiescing in the proof of\nher innocence; so he dismissed the charge against the accused, who\nstood down from among the rest, radiant with satisfaction.  The other\ndefendants were duly [97] convicted, and sentenced to a term of\nimprisonment with hard labour.  All this was quite correct; but here\ncomes matter for consideration with regard to the immaculate\ndispensation of justice as vaunted so confidently by Mr. Froude.\n\nOn receiving their sentence the women all stood down from the dock, to\nbe escorted to prison, except \"Lady,\" who, by the way, had preserved a\nrigid silence, while some of the other defendants had voluntarily and,\nit may be added, generously protested that L. B. was not present on the\noccasion of this particular row.  \"Lady,\" whether out of affection or\nfrom a less respectable motive, cried out to the stipendiary justice.\n\"But, sir, it ain't fair.  How is it every time that L. B. and me come\nup before you, you either fine or send up the two of us together, and\nto-day you are sending me up alone?\"  Moved either by the logic or the\npathos of this objurgation, the magistrate, turning towards L. B., who\nhad lingered after her narrow escape to watch the issue of the\nproceedings, thus addressed her:--\"L. B., upon second thoughts I order\nyou to the same term of hard labour at the Royal Gaol with the [98]\nothers.\"  The poor girl, having neither money nor friends intelligent\nenough to interfere on her behalf, had to submit, and she underwent the\nwhole of this iniquitous sentence.\n\nThe last typical case that we shall give illustrates the singular\napplication by this more than singular judge of the legal maxim caveat\nemptor.  A free coolie possessed of a donkey resolved to utilize the\nanimal in carting grass to the market.  He therefore called on another\ncoolie living at some distance from him, whom he knew to own two carts,\na small donkey-cart and an ordinary cart for mule or horse.  He\nproposed the purchase of the smaller cart, stating his reason for\nwishing to have it.  The donkey-cart was then shown to the intending\npurchaser, who, along with two Creole witnesses brought by him to make\nout and attest the receipt on the occasion, found some of the iron\nfittings defective, and drew the vendor's attention thereto.  He, on\nhis side, engaged, on receiving the amount agreed to for the cart, to\nsend it off to the blacksmith for immediate repairs, to be delivered to\nthe purchaser next morning at the latest.  On this understanding the\npurchase money was paid down, and the [99] receipt, specifying that the\nsum therein mentioned was for a donkey-cart, passed from the vendor to\nthe purchaser of the little vehicle.  Next day at about noon the man\nwent with his donkey for the cart.  Arrived there, his countryman had\nthe larger of the two carts brought out, and in pretended innocence\nsaid to the purchaser of the donkey-cart, \"Here is your cart.\"  On this\na warm dispute arose, which was not abated by the presence and protests\nof the two witnesses of the day before, who had hastily been summoned\nby the victim to bear out his contention that it was the donkey-cart\nand not the larger cart which had been examined, bargained for,\npurchased, and promised to be delivered, the day before.\n\nThe matter, on account of the sturdiness of the rascal's denials, had\nto be referred to a court of law.  The complainant engaged an able\nsolicitor, who laid the case before Mr. Mayne in all its transparent\nsimplicity and strength.  The defendant, although he had, and as a\nmatter of fact could have, no means of invalidating the evidence of the\ntwo witnesses, and above all of his receipt with his signature, relied\nupon the fact that the cart which he [100] offered was much larger than\nthe one the complainant had actually bought, and that therefore\ncomplainant would be the gainer by the transaction. Incredible as it\nmay sound, this view of the case commended itself to the magistrate,\nwho adopted it in giving his judgment against the complainant.  In vain\ndid the solicitor protest that all the facts of the case were centred\nin the desire and intention of the prosecutor to have specifically a\ndonkey-cart, which was abundantly proved by everything that had come\nout in the proceedings.  In vain also was his endeavour to show that a\nman having only a donkey would be hopelessly embarrassed by having a\ncart for it which was entirely intended for animals of much larger\nsize.  The magistrate solemnly reiterated his decision, and wound up by\nsaying that the victim had lost his case through disregard of the legal\nmaxim caveat emptor--let the purchaser be careful.  The rascally\ndefendant thus gained his case, and left the court in defiant triumph.\n\nThe four preceding cases are thoroughly significant of the original\nmethod in which thousands of cases were decided by this model\nmagistrate, to the great detriment, pecuniary, [101] social, and moral,\nduring more than ten years, of between 60,000 and 70,000 of the\npopulation within the circle of his judicial authority.  What shall we\nthink, therefore, of the fairness of Mr. Froude or his informants, who,\nprompt and eager in imputing unworthy motives to gentlemen with\ncharacters above reproach, have yet been so silent with regard to the\nflagrant and frequent abuses of more than one of their countrymen by\nwhom the honour and fair fame of their nation were for years draggled\nin the mire, and whose misdeeds were the theme of every tongue and\nthousands of newspaper-articles in the West Indian Colonies?\n\n     MR. ARTHUR CHILD, S.J.P.\n\nWe now take San Fernando, the next most important magisterial district\nafter Port of Spain.  At the time of Mr. Froude's visit, and for some\ntime before, the duties of the magistracy there were discharged by Mr.\nArthur Child, an \"English barrister\" who, of course, had possessed the\nrequisite qualification of being hopelessly briefless.  For the ideal\njustice which Mr. Froude would have Britons believe is meted out to the\nweaker classes by their fellow-countrymen [102] in the West Indies, we\nmay refer the reader to the conduct of the above-named functionary on\nthe memorable occasion of the slaughter of the coolies under Governor\nFreeling, in October, 1884.  Mr. Child, as Stipendiary justice, had the\nduty of reading the Riot Act to the immigrants, who were marching in\nprocession to the town of San Fernando, contrary, indeed, to the\nGovernment proclamation which had forbidden it; and he it was who gave\nthe order to \"fire,\" which resulted fatally to many of the unfortunate\ndevotees of Hosein.  This mandate and its lethal consequences\nanticipated by some minutes the similar but far more death-dealing\naction of the Chief of Police, who was stationed at another post in the\nvicinity of San Fernando.  The day after the shooting down of a total\nof more than one hundred immigrants, the protecting action of this\nmagistrate towards the weaker folk under his jurisdiction had a\nstriking exemplification, to which Mr. Froude is hereby made welcome.\nOf course there was a general cry of horror throughout the Colony, and\nespecially in the San Fernando district, at the fatal outcome of the\nproclamation, which had mentioned only \"fine\" and \"imprisonment,\" [103]\nbut not Death, as the penalty of disregarding its prohibitions. For\nnearly forty years, namely from their very first arrival in the Colony,\nthe East Indian immigrants had, according to specific agreement with\nthe Government, invariably been allowed the privilege of celebrating\ntheir annual feast of Hosein, by walking in procession with their\nPagodas through the public roads and streets of the island, without\nprohibition or hindrance of any kind from the authorities, save and\nexcept in cases where rival estate pagodas were in danger of getting\ninto collision on the question of precedence. On such occasions the\npolice, who always attended the processions, usually gave the lead to\nthe pagodas of the labourers of estates according to their seniority as\nimmigrants.\n\nIn no case up to 1884, after thirty odd years' inauguration in the\nColony, was the Hosein festival ever pretended to be any cause of\ndanger, actual or prospective, to any town or building.  On the\ncontrary, business grew brisker and solidly improved at the approach of\nthe commemoration, owing to the very considerable sale of\nparti-coloured paper, velvet, calico, and similar articles used in the\nconstruction [104] of the pagodas.  Governor Freeling, however, was, it\nmay be presumed, compelled to see danger in an institution which had\nhad nearly forty years' trial, without a single accident happening to\nwarrant any sudden interposition of the Government tending to its\nsuppression.  At all events, the only action taken in 1884, in prospect\nof their usual festival, was to notify the immigrants by proclamation,\nand, it is said, also through authorized agents, that the details of\ntheir f\u00c3\u00aate were not to be conducted in the usual manner; and that their\nappearance with pagodas in any public road or any town, without special\nlicense from some competent local authority, would entail the penalty\nof so many pounds fine, or imprisonment for so many months with hard\nlabour.  The immigrants, to whom this unexpected change on the part of\nthe authorities was utterly incomprehensible, both petitioned and sent\ndeputations to the Governor, offering guarantees for the, if possible,\nmore secure celebration of the Hosein, and praying His Excellency to\ncancel the prohibition as to the use of the roads, inasmuch as it\ninterfered with the essential part of their religious rite, which was\nthe \"drowning,\" or casting into [105] the sea, of the pagodas.  Having\nutterly failed in their efforts with the Governor, the coolies resolved\nto carry out their religious duty according to prescriptive forms,\naccepting, at the same time, the responsibility in the way of fine or\nimprisonment which they would thus inevitably incur.  A rumour was also\ncurrent at the time that, pursuant to this resolution, the head men of\nthe various plantations had authorized a general subscription amongst\ntheir countrymen, for meeting the contingency of fines in the police\ncourts.  All these things were the current talk of the population of\nSan Fernando, in which town the leading immigrants, free as well as\nindentured, had begun to raise funds for this purpose.\n\nAll that the public, therefore, expected would have resulted from the\nintended infringement of the Proclamation was an enormous influx of\nmoney in the shape of fines into the Colonial Treasury; as no one\ndoubted the extreme facility which existed for ascertaining exactly, in\nthe case of persons registered and indentured to specific plantations,\nthe names and abodes of at least the chief offenders against the\nproclamation.  Accordingly, on the [106] occurrence of the bloody\ncatastrophe related above, every one felt that the mere persistence in\nmarching all unarmed towards the town, without actually attempting to\nforce their way into it, was exorbitantly visited upon the coolies by a\nviolent death or a life-long mutilation.  This sentiment few were at\nany pains to conceal; but as the poorer and more ignorant classes can\nbe handled with greater impunity than those who are intelligent and\nhave the means of self-defence, Mr. Justice Child, the very day after\nthe tragedy, and without waiting for the pro form\u00c3\u00a2 official inquiry\ninto the tragedy in which he bore so conspicuous a part, actually\ncaused to be arrested, sat to try and sent to hard labour, persons whom\nthe police, in obedience to his positive injunctions, had reported to\nhim as having condemned the shooting down of the immigrants!  Those who\nwere arrested and thus summarily punished had, of course, no means of\nself-protection; and as the case is typical of others, as illustrative\nof \"justice-made law\" applied to \"subject races\" in a British colony,\nMr. Froude is free to accept it, or not, in corroboration of his\nunqualified panegyrics.\n\n[107]\n\n     MR. GROVE HUMPHREY CHAPMAN, S.J.P.\n\nAs Stipendary Magistrate of this self-same San Fernando district, Grove\nHumphrey Chapman, Esquire (another English barrister), was the\nimmediate predecessor of Mr. Child.  More humane than Mr. Mayne, his\ncolleague and contemporary in Port of Spain, this young magistrate\nbegan his career fairly well.  But he speedily fell a victim to the\ninfluences immediately surrounding him in his new position.  His head,\nwhich later events proved never to have been naturally strong, began to\nbe turned by the unaccustomed deference which he met with on all hands,\nfrom high and low, official and non-official, and he himself soon\nconsummated the addling of his brain by persistent practical revolts\nagainst every maxim of the ancient Nazarenes in the matter of\npotations.  His decisions at the court, therefore, became perfect\nemulations of those of Mr. Mayne, as well in perversity as in\nharshness, and many in his case also were the appeals for relief made\nto the head of the executive by the inhabitants of the district--but of\ncourse in vain.  Governor Irving was at this time in office, and the\nunfortunate [108] victims of perverse judgments--occasionally\npronounced by this magistrate in his cups--were only poor Negroes,\ncoolies, or other persons whose worldly circumstances placed them in\nthe category of the \"weaker\" in the community.  To these classes of\npeople that excellent ruler unhappily denied--we dare not say his\npersonal sympathy, but--the official protection which, even through\nself-respect, he might have perfunctorily accorded.  Bent, however, on\nrunning through the whole gamut of extravagance, Mr. Chapman--by\ninterpreting official impunity into implying a direct license for the\nwildest of his caprices--plunged headlong with ever accelerating speed,\ntill the deliverance of the Naparimas became the welcome consequence of\nhis own personal action.  On one occasion it was credibly reported in\nthe Colony that this infatuated dispenser of British justice actually\nstretched his official complaisance so far as to permit a lady not only\nto be seated near him on the judicial bench, but also to take a\npart--loud, boisterous and abusive--in the legal proceedings of the\nday.  Meanwhile, as the Governor could not be induced to interfere,\nthings went [109] on from bad to worse, till one day, as above hinted,\nthe unfortunate magistrate so publicly committed himself as to be\nobliged to be borne for temporary refuge to the Lunatic Asylum, whence\nhe was clandestinely shipped from the Colony on \"six months' leave of\nabsence,\" never more to resume his official station.\n\nThe removal of two such magistrates as those whose careers we have so\nbriefly sketched out--Mr. Mayne having died, still a magistrate, since\nMr. Froude's departure--has afforded opportunity for the restoration of\nBritish protecting influence.  In the person of Mr. Llewellyn Lewis, as\nmagistrate of Port of Spain, this opportunity has been secured.  He, it\nis generally rumoured, strives to justify the expectations of fair play\nand even-handed justice which are generally entertained concerning\nEnglishmen.  It is, however, certain that with a Governor so prompt to\nhear the cry of the poor as Sir William Robinson has proved himself to\nbe, and with a Chief Justice so vigilant, fearless, and painstaking as\nSir John Gorrie, the entire magistracy of the Colony must be so\nbeneficially influenced as to preclude [110] the frequency of appeals\nbeing made to the higher courts, or it may be to the Executive, on\naccount of scandalously unjust and senseless decisions.\n\nSo long, too, as the names of T. S. Warner, Captain Larcom, and F. H.\nHamblin abide in the grateful remembrance of the entire population, as\nideally upright, just, and impartial dispensers of justice, each in his\nown jurisdiction, we can only sigh at the temporal dispensation which\nrenders practicable the appointment and retention in office of such\nadministrators of the Law as were Mr. Mayne and Mr. Chapman.  The\nwidespread and irreparable mischiefs wrought by these men still affect\ndisastrously many an unfortunate household; and the execration by the\nweaker in the community of their memory, particularly that of Robert\nDawson Mayne, is only a fitting retribution for their abuse of power.\n\nNOTES\n\n85. *A West Indian official superstition professes to believe that a\nBritish barrister must make an exceptionally good colonial S.J.P.,\nseeing that he is ignorant of everything, save general English law,\nthat would qualify him for the post!  In this, to acquit oneself\ntolerably, some acquaintance with the language, customs, and habits of\nthought of the population is everywhere else held to be of prime\nimportance,--native conscientiousness and honesty of purpose being\ndefinitively presupposed.\n\n\n\nBOOK III: SOCIAL REVOLUTION\n\n[113] Never was the Knight of La Mancha more convinced of his imaginary\nmission to redress the wrongs of the world than Mr. James Anthony\nFroude seems to be of his ability to alter the course of events,\nespecially those bearing on the destinies of the Negro in the British\nWest Indies.  The doctrinaire style of his utterances, his sublime\nindifference as to what Negro opinion and feelings may be, on account\nof his revelations, are uniquely charming.  In that portion of his book\nheaded \"Social Revolution\" our author, with that mixture of frankness\nand cynicism which is so dear to the soul of the British esprit fort of\nto-day, has challenged a comparison between British Colonial policy on\nthe [114] one hand, and the Colonial policy of France and Spain on the\nother.  This he does with an evident recklessness that his approval of\nSpain and France involves a definite condemnation of his own country.\nHowever, let us hear him:--\n\n\"The English West Indies, like other parts of the world, are going\nthrough a silent revolution.  Elsewhere the revolution, as we hope, is\na transition state, a new birth; a passing away of what is old and worn\nout, that a fresh and healthier order may rise in its place.  In the\nWest Indies the most sanguine of mortals will find it difficult to\nentertain any such hope at all.\"\n\nAs Mr. Froude is speaking dogmatically here of his, or rather our, West\nIndies, let us hear him as he proceeds:--\n\n\"We have been a ruling power there for two hundred and fifty years; the\nwhites whom we planted as our representatives are drifting into ruin,\nand they regard England and England's policy as the principal cause of\nit.  The blacks whom, in a fit of virtuous benevolence, we emancipated,\ndo not feel particularly obliged to us.  They think, if they think at\nall, that they were [115] ill-treated originally, and have received no\nmore than was due to them.\"\n\nThus far.  Now, as to \"the whites whom we planted as our\nrepresentatives,\" and who, Mr. Froude avers, are drifting into ruin, we\nconfess to a total ignorance of their whereabouts in these islands in\nthis jubilee year of Negro Emancipation.  Of the representatives of\nBritain immediately before and after Emancipation we happen to know\nsomething, which, on the testimony of Englishmen, Mr. Froude will be\nmade quite welcome to before our task is ended.  With respect to Mr.\nFroude's statement as to the ingratitude of the emancipated Blacks, if\nit is aimed at the slaves who were actually set free, it is utterly\nuntrue; for no class of persons, in their humble and artless way, are\nmore attached to the Queen's majesty, whom they regard as incarnating\nin her gracious person the benevolence which Mr. Froude so jauntily\nscoffs at.  But if our censor's remark under this head is intended for\nthe present generation of Blacks, it is a pure and simple absurdity.\nWhat are we Negroes of the present day to be grateful for to the US,\npersonified by Mr. Froude and the Colonial [116] Office exportations?\nWe really believe, from what we know of Englishmen, that very few\nindeed would regard Mr. Froude's reproach otherwise than as a palpable\nadding of insult to injury.  Obliged to \"us,\" indeed!  Why, Mr. Froude,\nwho speaks of us as dogs and horses, suggests that the same kindliness\nof treatment that secures the attachment of those noble brutes would\nhave the same result in our case.  With the same consistency that marks\nhis utterances throughout his book, he tells his readers \"that there is\nno original or congenital difference between the capacity of the White\nand the Negro races.\"  He adds, too, significantly: \"With the same\nchances and with the same treatment, I believe that distinguished men\nwould be produced equally from both races.\"  After this truthful\ntestimony, which Pelion upon Ossa of evidence has confirmed, does Mr.\nFroude, in the fatuity of his skin-pride, believe that educated men,\nworthy of the name, would be otherwise than resentful, if not\ndisgusted, at being shunted out of bread in their own native land,\nwhich their parents' labours and taxes have made desirable, in order to\nafford room to blockheads, vulgarians, [117] or worse, imported from\nbeyond the seas?  Does Mr. Froude's scorn of the Negroes' skin extend,\ninconsistently on his part, to their intelligence and feelings also?\nAnd if so, what has the Negro to care--if let alone and not wantonly\nthwarted in his aspirations?  It sounds queer, not to say unnatural and\nscandalous, that Englishmen should in these days of light be the\nchampions of injustice towards their fellow-subjects, not for any\nintellectual or moral disqualification, but on the simple account of\nthe darker skin of those who are to be assailed and thwarted in their\nlife's career and aspirations.  Really, are we to be grateful that the\ncolour difference should be made the basis and justification of the\ndastardly denials of justice, social, intellectual, and moral, which\nhave characterized the r\u00c3\u00a9gime of those who Mr. Froude boasts were left\nto be the representatives of Britain's morality and fair play?  Are the\nNegroes under the French flag not intensely French? Are the Negroes\nunder the Spanish flag not intensely Spanish? Wherefore are they so?\nIt is because the French and Spanish nations, who are neither of them\ninferior in origin or the [118] nobility of the part they have each\nplayed on the historic stage, have had the dignity and sense to\nunderstand the lowness of moral and intellectual consciousness implied\nin the subordination of questions of an imperial nature to the\nslaveholder's anxiety about the hue of those who are to be benefited or\nnot in the long run.  By Spain and France every loyal and law-abiding\nsubject of the Mother Country has been a citizen deemed worthy all the\nrights, immunities, and privileges flowing from good and creditable\ncitizenship.  Those meriting such distinction were taken into the bosom\nof the society which their qualifications recommended them to share,\nand no office under the Government has been thought too good or too\nelevated for men of their stamp.  No wonder, then, that Mr. Froude is\nsilent regarding the scores of brilliant coloured officials who adorn\nthe civil service of France and Spain, and whose appointment, in\ncontrast with what has usually been the case in British Colonies,\nreflects an abiding lustre on those countries, and establishes their\nright to a foremost place among nations.\n\nMr. Froude, in speaking of Chief Justice [119] Reeves, ventures upon a\nsmart truism which we can discuss for him, but of course not in the\nsense in which he has meant it.  \"Exceptions,\" our author remarks, \"are\nsupposed proverbially to prove nothing, or to prove the very opposite\nof what they appear to prove.  When a particular phenomenon occurs\nrarely, the probabilities are strong against the recurrence of it.\"\nNow, is it in ignorance, or through disingenuousness, that Mr. Froude\nhas penned this argument regarding exceptions?  Surely, in the vast\narea of American life, it is not possible that he could see Frederick\nDouglass alone out of the cluster of prominent Black Americans who are\ndoing the work of their country so worthily and so well in every\nofficial department.  Anyhow, Mr. Froude's history of the Emancipation\nmay here be amended for him by a reminder that, in the British\nColonies, it was not Whites as masters, and Blacks as slaves, who were\naffected by that momentous measure.  In fact, 1838 found in the British\nColonies very nearly as many Negro and Mulatto slave-owners as there\nwere white.  Well then, these black and yellow planters received their\nquota, it may be presumed, of [120] the \u00c2\u00a320,000,000 sterling indemnity.\nThey were part and parcel of the proprietary body in the Colonies, and\nhad to meet the crisis like the rest.  They were very wealthy, some of\nthese Ethiopic accomplices of the oppressors of their own race.  Their\nsons and daughters were sent, like the white planter's children, across\nthe Atlantic for a European education.  These young folk returned to\ntheir various native Colonies as lawyers and doctors.  Many of them\nwere also wealthy planters.  The daughters, of course, became in time\nthe mothers of the new generation of prominent inhabitants.  Now, in\nAmerica all this was different.  No \"nigger,\" however alabaster fair,\nwas ever allowed the privileges of common citizenship, let alone the\nright to hold property in others.  If possessed by a weakness to pass\nfor white men, as very many of them could easily have contrived to do,\nwoe unto the poor impostors!  They were hunted down from city to city\nas few felons would be, and finally done to death--\"serve them right!\"\nbeing the grim commentary regarding their fate for having sought to\nusurp the ineffable privilege of whitemanship!  All this, Mr. Froude,\nwas [121] the rule, the practice, in America, with regard to persons of\ncolour up to twenty-five years ago.  Now, sir, what is the phenomenon\nwhich strikes your vision in that mighty Republic to-day, with regard\nto those self-same despised, discountenanced, persecuted and harried\ndescendants of Ham?  We shall tell you of the change that has taken\nplace in their condition, and also some of the reasons of that\nbeneficent revolution.\n\nThe Proclamation of Emancipation on January 1st, 1863, was, by\nPresident Lincoln, frankly admitted to have been a war necessity.  No\nabstract principle of justice or of morals was of primary consideration\nin the matter.  The saving of the Union at any cost,--that is, the\nstern political emergency forced forth the document which was to be the\nsocial salvation of every descendant of Ham in the United States of\nAmerica.  Close upon the heels of their emancipation, the\nenfranchisement of the Negroes was pushed forward by the thorough-going\nAmerican statesmen.  They had no sentimentality to defer to.  The logic\nof events--the fact not only of the coloured race being freedmen, but\nalso of their having been effective [122] comrades on the fields of\nbattle, where the blood of eager thousands of them had flowed on the\nUnion side, pointed out too plainly that men with such claims should\nalso be partners in the resulting triumph.\n\nMr. Froude, being so deferential to skin prejudice, will doubtless find\nit strange that such a measure as the Civil Rights Bill should have\npassed a Congress of Americans.  Assuredly with the feeling against the\ncoloured race which custom and law had engrafted into the very nature\nof the vast majority, this was a tremendous call to make on the\nnational susceptibilities.  But it has been exactly this that has\nbrought out into such vivid contrast the conduct of the British\nstatesman, loudly professing to be unprejudiced as to colour, and fair\nand humane, on the one hand, and, on the other hand, the dealings of\nthe politicians of America, who had, as a matter of fact, sucked in\naversion and contempt towards the Negro together with their mother's\nmilk.  Of course no sane being could expect that feelings so deeply\ningrained and nourished could be rooted out by logic or by any\nlegislative enactment.  But, indeed, it is sublimely creditable to\n[123] the American Government that, whatever might be the personal and\nprivate sentiments of its individual members as regards race, palmam\nferat qui meruit--\"let him bear the palm who has deserved it\"--has been\ntheir motto in dealing generally with the claims of their Ethiopic\nfellow-citizens.  Hence it is that in only twenty-five years America\ncan show Negro public officers as thick as blackberries, while Mr.\nFroude can mention only Mr. Justice Reeves in FIFTY years as a sample\nof the \"exceptional\" progress under British auspices of a man of\nAfrican descent!  Verily, if in fifty long years British policy can\nrecognize only one single exception in a race between which and the\nwhite race there is no original or congenital difference of capacity,\nthe inference must be that British policy has been not only\nsystematically, but also too successfully, hostile to the advancement\nof the Ethiopians subject thereto; while the \"fair field and no favour\"\nmanagement of the strong-minded Americans has, by its results,\nconfirmed the culpability of the English policy in its relation to\n\"subject races.\"\n\nThe very suggestive section of \"the English [124] in the West Indies,\"\nfrom which we have already given extracts, and which bears the title\n\"Social Revolution,\" thus proceeds:--\n\n\"But it does not follow that what can be done eventually can be done\nimmediately, and the gulf which divides the colours is no arbitrary\nprejudice, but has been opened by the centuries of training and\ndiscipline which have given us the start in the race\" (p. 125 [Froude]).\n\nThe reference in the opening clause of the above citation, as to what\nis eventually possible not being immediately feasible, is to the\nelevation of Blacks to high official posts, such as those occupied by\nJudge Reeves in Barbados, and by Mr. F. Douglass in the United States.\nWe have already disposed by anticipation of the above contention of Mr.\nFroude's, by showing that in only twenty-five years America has found\nhundreds of eminent Blacks to fill high posts under her government.\nOur author's futile mixture of Judge Reeves' exceptional case with that\nof Fred. Douglass, which he cunningly singles out from among so many in\nthe United States, is nothing but a subterfuge, of the same queer and\nflimsy description with which the literature of the cause now\nchampioned [125] by his eloquence has made the world only too familiar.\nWhat can Mr. Froude conceive any sane man should see in common between\nthe action of British and of American statesmanship in the matter now\nunder discussion?  If his utterance on this point is that of a British\nspokesman, let him abide by his own verdict against his own case, as\nembodied in the words, \"the gulf which divides the two COLOURS is no\narbitrary prejudice,\" which, coupled with his contention that the\nelevation of the Blacks is not immediately feasible, discloses the\nwideness of divergence between British and American political opinion\non this identical subject.\n\nMr. Froude is pathetically eloquent on the colour question.  He tells\nof the wide gulf between the two colours--we suppose it is as wide as\nexists between his white horse and his black horse.  Seriously,\nhowever, does not this kind of talk savour only too much of the\nslave-pen and the auction-block of the rice-swamp and the cotton-field;\nof the sugar-plantation and the driver's lash?  In the United States\nalone, among all the slave-holding Powers, was the difference of race\nand colour invoked openly and boldly to justify all the enormities that\n[126] were the natural accompaniments of those \"institutions\" of the\nPast.  But is Mr. Froude serious in invoking the ostracizing of\ninnocent, loyal, and meritorious British subjects on account of their\nmere colour?  Physical slavery--which was no crime per se, Mr. Froude\ntells us--had at least overwhelming brute power, and that silent,\npassive force which is even more potential as an auxiliary, viz.,\nunenlightened public opinion, whose neutrality is too often a positive\nsupport to the empire of wrong.\n\nBut has Mr. Froude, in his present wild propaganda on behalf of\npolitical and, therefore, of social repression, anything analogous to\nthose two above-specified auxiliaries to rely on?  We trow not.  Then\nwhy this frantic bluster and shouting forth of indiscreet aspirations\non be half of a minority to whom accomplished facts, when not agreeable\nto or manipulated by themselves, are a perpetual grievance, generating\nlife-long impotent protestations?  Presumably there are possibilities\nthe thoughts of which fascinate our author and his congeners in this,\nto our mind, vain campaign in the cause of social retrogression.  But,\nbe the incentives what they may, it might not be amiss on our [127]\npart to suggest to those impelled by them that the ignoring of Negro\nopinion in their calculations, though not only possible but easily\npractised fifty years ago, is a portentous blunder at the present time.\nVerbum sapienti.\n\nMr. Froude must see that he has set about his Negro-repression campaign\nin too blundering a fashion.  He evidently expects to be able to throw\ndust into the eyes of the intelligent world, juggler-wise, through the\nagency of the mighty pronoun US, as representing the entire Anglo-Saxon\nrace, in his advocacy of the now scarcely intelligible pretensions of a\nlittle coterie of Her Majesty's subjects in the West Indies.  These\ngentry are hostile, he urges, to the presence of progressive Negroes on\nthe soil of the tropics!  Yet are these self-same Negroes not only\nnatives, but active improvers and embellishers of that very soil.  We\ncannot help concluding that this impotent grudge has sprung out of the\nadditional fact that these identical Negroes constitute also a living\nrefutation of the sinister predictions ventured upon generally against\ntheir race, with frantic recklessness, even within the last three\ndecades, by affrighted slave-holders, of whose ravings Mr. Froude's\nbook is only a [128] diluted echo, out of season and outrageous to the\nconscience of modern civilization.\n\nIt is patent, then, that the matters which Mr. Froude has sought to\nforce up to the dignity of genetic rivalship, has nothing of that\nimportance about it.  His US, between whom and the Negro subjects of\nGreat Britain the gulf of colour lies, comprises, as he himself owns,\nan outnumbered and, as we hope to prove later on, a not over-creditable\nlittle clique of Anglo-Saxon lineage.  The real US who have started\nahead of the Negroes, \"through the training and discipline of\ncenturies,\" are assuredly not anything like \"represented\" by the few\npretentious incapables who, instead of conquering predominance, as they\nwho deserve it always do, like men, are whimpering like babies after\ndearly coveted but utterly unattainable enjoyments--to be had at the\nexpense of the interests of the Negroes whom they, rather amusingly,\naffect to despise.  When Mr. Froude shall have become able to present\nfor the world's contemplation a question respecting which the\nAnglo-Saxon family, in its grand world-wide predominance, and the\nAfrican family, in its yet feeble, albeit promising, incipience of\nself-adjustment, shall [129] actually be competitors, then, and only\nthen, will it be time to accept the outlook as serious.  But when, as\nin the present case, he invokes the whole prestige of the Anglo-Saxon\nrace in favour of the untenable pretensions of a few blas\u00c3\u00a9s of that\nrace, and that to the social and political detriment of tens of\nthousands of black fellow-subjects, it is high time that the common\nsense of civilization should laugh him out of court.  The US who are\nflourishing, or pining, as the case may be, in the British West\nIndies--by favour of the Colonial Office on the former hypothesis, or,\non the second, through the misdirection of their own faculties--do not,\nand, in the very nature of things, cannot in any race take the lead of\nany set of men endowed with virile attributes, the conditions of the\ncontest being on all sides identical.\n\nPass we onward to extract and comment on other passages in this very\nengaging section of Mr. Froude's book.  On the same page (125) he\nsays:--\n\n\"The African Blacks have been free enough for thousands, perhaps for\nten thousands of years, and it has been the absence of restraint which\nhas prevented them from becoming civilized.\"\n\n[130] All this, perhaps, is quite true, and, in the absence of positive\nevidence to the contrary of our author's dogmatic assertions, we save\ntime by allowing him all the benefit he can derive from whatever weight\nthey might carry.\n\n\"Generation has followed generation, and the children are as like their\nfathers as the successive generations of apes.\"\n\nTo this we can have nothing to object; especially in view of what the\nwriter goes on to say, and that on his own side of the hedge--somewhat\nqualified though his admission may be:--\"The whites, it is likely\nenough, succeeded one another with the same similarity for a series of\nages.\"  Our speculator grows profoundly philosophic here; and in this\nmood thus entertains his readers in a strain which, though deep, we\nshall strive to find clear:--\n\n\"It is now supposed that human race has been on the planet for a\nhundred thousand years at least; and the first traces of civilization\ncannot be thrown back at furthest beyond six thousand.  During all this\ntime mankind went on treading in the same steps, century after century\nmaking no more advance than the birds and beasts.\"\n\n[131] In all this there is nothing that can usefully be taken exception\nto; for speculation and conjecture, if plausible and attractive, are\nfree to revel whenever written documents and the unmistakable\nindications of the earth's crust are both entirely at fault.  Warming\nup with his theme, Mr. Froude gets somewhat ambiguous in the very next\nsentence.  Says he:--\n\n\"In Egypt or India or one knows not where, accident or natural\ndevelopment quickened into life our moral and intellectual faculties;\nand these faculties have grown into what we now experience, not in the\nfreedom in which the modern takes delight, but under the sharp rule of\nthe strong over the weak, of the wise over the unwise.\"\n\nOur author, as we see, begins his above quoted deliverance quite at a\nloss with regard to the agency to which the incipience, growth, and\nfructification of man's faculties should be attributed.  \"Accident,\"\n\"natural development,\" he suggests, quickened the human faculties into\nthe progressive achievements which they have accomplished.  But then,\nwherefore is this writer so forcible, so confident in his prophecies\nregarding Negroes and their future temporal condition [132] and\nproceedings, since it is \"accident,\" and \"accident\" only, that must\ndetermine their fulfilment?  Has he so securely bound the fickle\ndivinity to his service as to be certain of its agency in the\nrealization of his forecasts?  And if so, where then would be the\nfortuitousness that is the very essence of occurrences that glide,\nundesigned, unexpected, unforeseen, into the domain of Fact, and become\nmaterial for History?  So far as we feel capable of intelligently\nmeditating on questions of this inscrutable nature, we are forced to\nconclude that since \"natural development\" could be so regular, so\ncontinuous, and withal so efficient, in the production of the\nmarvellous results that we daily contemplate, there must be existent\nand in operation--as, for instance, in the case of the uniformity\ncharacterizing for ages successive generations of mankind, as above\nadduced by our philosopher himself--some controlling LAW, according and\nsubject to which no check has marred the harmonious progression, or\nprevented the consummations that have crowned the normal exercise of\nhuman energy, intellectual as well as physical.\n\nThe sharp rule of the strong over the [133] weak, is the first clause\nof the Carlylean-sounding phrase which embodies the requisite\nconditions for satisfactory human development.  The terms expressive of\nthese conditions, however, while certainly suggesting and embracing the\nbeneficent, elevating influence and discipline of European\ncivilization, such as we know and appreciate it, do not by any means\nexclude the domination of Mr. Legree or any other typical man-monster,\nwhose power over his fellow-creatures is at once a calamity to the\nvictims and a disgrace to the community tolerating not only its\nexercise, but the very possibility of its existence. The sharp rule of\n\"the wise over the unwise,\" is the closing section of the\nrecommendation to ensure man's effective development.  Not even savages\nhesitate to defer in all their important designs to the sought-for\nguidance of superior judgments.  But in the case of us West Indian\nBlacks, to whom Mr. Froude's doctrine here has a special reference, is\nit suggested by him that the bidders for predominance over us on the\npurely epidermal, the white skin, ground, are ipso facto the\nmonopolists of directing wisdom?  It surely cannot be so; for Mr.\nFroude's own chapters regarding both the [134] nomination by Downing\nStreet of future Colonial office-holders and the disorganized mental\nand moral condition of the indigenous representatives--as he calls\nthem!--of his country in these climes, preclude the possibility that\nthe reference regarding the wise can be to them.  Now since this is so,\nwe really cannot see why the pains should have been taken to indite the\nabove truism, to the truth whereof, under every normal or legitimate\ncircumstance, the veriest barbarian, by spontaneously resorting to and\ncheerfully abiding by it, is among the first to secure practical effect.\n\n\"Our own Anglo-Saxon race,\" continues our author, \"has been capable of\nself-government only after a thousand years of civil and spiritual\nauthority.  European government, European instruction, continued\nsteadily till his natural tendencies are superseded by higher\ninstincts, may shorten the probation period of the negro.  Individual\nblacks of exceptional quality, like Frederick Douglass in America, or\nthe Chief Justice of Barbados, will avail themselves of opportunities\nto rise, and the freest opportunity OUGHT TO BE offered them.\"  Here we\nare reminded of the dogma laid down by a certain [135] class of\nethnologists, to the effect that intellectuality, when displayed by a\nperson of mixed European and African blood, must always be assigned to\nthe European side of the parentage; and in the foregoing citation our\nauthor speaks of two personages undoubtedly belonging to the class\nembraced in the above dogma.  Three specific objections may, therefore,\nbe urged against the statements which we have indicated in the above\nquotation.  First and foremost, neither Judge Reeves nor Mr. Fred\nDouglass is a black man, as Mr. Froude inaccurately represents each of\nthem to be.  The former is of mixed blood, to what degree we are not\nadepts enough to determine; and the latter, if his portrait and those\nwho have personally seen him mislead us not, is a decidedly fair man.\n\nWe, of course, do not for a moment imagine that either of those eminent\ndescendants of Ham cares a jot about the settlement of this question,\nwhich doubtless would appear very trivial to both.  But as our author's\ncrusade is against the Negro--by which we understand the undiluted\nAfrican descendant, the pure Negro, as he singularly describes Chief\nJustice Reeves--our anxiety is to show that there exist, both [136] in\nthe West Indies and in the United States, scores of genuine black men\nto whom neither of these two distinguished patriots would, for one\ninstant, hesitate to concede any claim to equality in intellectual and\nsocial excellence.  The second exception which we take is, as we have\nalready shown in a previous page, to the persistent lugging in of\nAmerica by Mr. Froude, doubtless to keep his political countrymen in\ncountenance with regard to the Negro question.  We have already pointed\nout the futility of this proceeding on our author's part, and suggested\nhow damaging it might prove to the cause he is striving to uphold.\n\"Blacks of exceptional quality,\" like the two gentlemen he has\nspecially mentioned, \"will avail themselves of opportunities to rise.\"\nMost certainly they will, Mr. Froude--but, for the present, only in\nAmerica, where those opportunities are really free and open to all.\nThere no parasitical non-workers are to be found, eager to eat bread,\nbut in the sweat of other people's brows; no impecunious title-bearers;\nno importunate bores, nor other similar characters whom the Government\nthere would regard it as their duty  \"to provide for\"--by quartering\nthem on the revenues [137] of Colonial dependencies.  But in the\nBritish Crown--or rather \"Anglo-West Indian\"--governed Colonies, has it\never been, can it ever be, thus ordered?  Our author's description of\nthe exigencies that compel injustice to be done in order to requite, or\nperhaps to secure, Parliamentary support, coupled with his account of\nthe bitter animus against the coloured race that rankles in the bosom\nof his \"Englishmen in the West Indies,\" sufficiently proves the utter\nhypocrisy of his recommendation, that the freest opportunities should\nbe offered to Blacks of the said exceptional order.  The very wording\nof Mr. Froude's recommendation is disingenuous.  It is one stone sped\nat two birds, and which, most naturally, has missed them both.\n\nMr. Froude knew perfectly well that, twenty-five years before he wrote\nhis book, America had thrown open the way to public advancement to the\nBlacks, as it had been previously free to Whites alone.  His use of\n\"should be offered,\" instead of \"are offered,\" betrays his\nconsciousness that, at the time he was writing, the offering of any\nopportunities of the kind he suggests was a thing still to be desired\nunder British jurisdiction.  The third objection [138] which we shall\ntake to Mr. Froude's bracketing of the cases of Mr. Fred Douglass and\nof Judge Reeves together, is that, when closely examined, the two cases\ncan be distinctly seen to be not in any way parallel.  The applause\nwhich our author indirectly bids for on behalf of British Colonial\nliberality in the instance of Mr. Reeves would be the grossest mockery,\nif accorded in any sense other than we shall proceed to show.  Fred\nDouglass was born and bred a slave in one of the Southern States of the\nUnion, and regained his freedom by flight from bondage, a grown man,\nand, of course, under the circumstances, solitary and destitute.  He\nreached the North at a period when the prejudice of the Whites against\nmen of his race was so rampant as to constitute a positive mania.\n\nThe stern and cruelly logical doctrine, that a Negro had no rights\nwhich white men were bound to respect, was in full blast and practical\nexemplification.  Yet amidst it all, and despite of it all, this gifted\nfugitive conquered his way into the Temple of Knowledge, and became\neminent as an orator, a writer, and a lecturer on political and general\nsubjects.  Hailed abroad [139] as a prodigy, and received with\nacclamation into the brotherhood of intelligence, abstract justice and\nmoral congruity demanded that such a man should no longer be subject to\nthe shame and abasement of social, legal, and political proscription.\nThe land of his birth proved herself equal to this imperative call of\ncivilized Duty, regardless of customs and the laws, written as well as\nunwritten, which had doomed to life-long degradation every member of\nthe progeny of Ham.  Recognizing in the erewhile bondman a born leader\nof men, America, with the unflinching directness that has marked her\ncourse, whether in good or in evil, responded with spontaneous loyalty\nto the inspiration of her highest instincts.  Shamed into compunction\nand remorse at the solid fame and general sympathy secured for himself\nby a son of her soil, whom, in the wantonness of pride and power, she\nhad denied all fostering care (not, indeed, for any conscious offending\non his part, but by reason of a natural peculiarity which she had\ndecreed penal), America, like a repentant mother, stooped from her\naugust seat, and giving with enthusiasm both hands to the outcast, she\nhelped him to stand forward and erect, [140] in the dignity of\nuntrammeled manhood, making him, at the same time, welcome to a place\nof honour amongst the most gifted, the worthiest and most favoured of\nher children.\n\nChief Justice Reeves, on the other hand, did not enter the world, as\nDouglass had done, heir to a lot of intellectual darkness and legalized\nsocial and political proscription.  Associated from adolescence with S.\nJ. Prescod, the greatest leader of popular opinion whom Barbados has\nyet produced, Mr. Reeves possessed in his nature the material to\nassimilate and reflect in his own principles and conduct the salient\ncharacteristics of his distinguished Mentor. Arrived in England to\nstudy law, he had there the privilege of the personal acquaintance of\nLord Brougham, then one of the Nestors of the great Emancipation\nconflict.  On returning to his native island, which he did immediately\nafter his call to the bar, Mr. Reeves sprung at once into the foremost\nplace, and retained his precedence till his labours and aspirations\nwere crowned by his obtaining the highest judicial post in that Colony.\nFor long years before becoming Chief Justice, Mr. Reeves had conquered\nfor himself the respect and confidence [141] of all Barbadians--even\nincluding the ultra exclusive \"Anglo-West-Indians\" of Mr. Froude--by\nthe manful constitutional stand which, sacrificing official place, he\nhad successfully made against the threatened abrogation of the Charter\nof the Colony, which every class and colour of natives cherish and\nrevere as a most precious, almost sacred, inheritance.  The successful\nchampion of their menaced liberties found clustering around him the\ngrateful hearts of all his countrymen, who, in their hour of dread at\nthe danger of their time-honoured constitution, had clung in despair to\nhim as the only leader capable of heading the struggle and leading the\npeople, by wise and constitutional guidance, to the victory which they\ndesired but could not achieve for themselves.\n\nSir William Robinson, who was sent out as pacificator, saw and took in\nat a glance the whole significance of the condition of affairs,\nespecially in their relation to Mr. Reeves, and vice vers\u00c3\u00a2.  With the\nunrivalled pre-eminence and predominant personal influence of the\nlatter, the Colonial Office had possessed more than ample means of\nbeing perfectly familiar.  What, then, could be more natural and\nconsonant with [142] sound policy than that the then acknowledged, but\nofficially unattached, head of the people (being an eminent lawyer),\nshould, on the occurrence of a vacancy in the highest juridical post,\nbe appointed to co-operate with the supreme head of the Executive?  Mr.\nReeves was already the chief of the legal body of the Colony; his\nappointment, therefore, as Chief Justice amounted to nothing more than\nan official ratification of an accomplished and unalterable fact.  Of\ncourse, it was no fault of England's that the eminent culture,\npolitical influence, and unapproached legal status of Mr. Reeves should\nhave coincided exactly with her political requirements at that crisis,\nnor yet that she should have utilized a coincidence which had the\ndouble advantage of securing the permanent services, whilst realizing\nat the same time the life's aspiration, of a distinguished British\nsubject.  But that Mr. Froude should be dinning in our ears this case\nof benefited self-interest, gaining the amplest reciprocity, both as to\nservice and serviceableness, with the disinterested spontaneity of\nAmerica's elevation of Mr. Douglass, is but another proof of the\nobliquity of the moral medium through [143] which he is wont to survey\nmankind and their concerns.\n\nThe distinction between the two marvellous careers which we have been\ndiscussing demands, as it is susceptible of, still sharper\naccentuation.  In the final success of Reeves, it is the man himself\nwho confronts one in the unique transcendency and victoriousness of\npersonal merit.  On the other hand, a million times the personal merit\nof Reeves combined with his own could have availed Douglass absolutely\nnothing in the United States, legal and social proscript that he was,\nwith public opinion generally on the side of the laws and usages\nagainst him.  The very little countries of the world are proverbial for\nthe production of very great men.  But, on the other hand, narrowness\nof space favours the concentration and coherence of the adverse forces\nthat might impede, if they fail of utterly thwarting, the success which\nmay happen to be grudged by those possessing the will and the power for\nits obstruction.  In Barbados, so far as we have heard, read, and seen\nourselves of the social ins and outs of that little sister-colony, the\noperation of the above mentioned [144] influences has been, may still\nbe, to a certain extent, distinctly appreciable.  Although in English\njurisprudence there is no law ordaining the proscription, on the ground\nof race or colour, of any eligible candidate for social or political\nadvancement, yet is it notorious that the ethics and practices of the\n\"Anglo-West Indians\"--who, our author has dared to say, represent the\nhigher type of Englishmen--have, throughout successive generations,\neffectually and of course detrimentally operated, as though by a\npositive Medo-Persian edict, in a proscriptive sense.  It therefore\ndemanded extraordinary toughness of constitutional fibre, moral,\nmental, and, let us add, physical too, to overcome the obstacles\nopposed to the progress of merit, too often by persons in intelligence\nbelow contempt, but, in prosperity and accepted pretension, formidable\nindeed to fight against and overcome.  We shudder to think of the petty\ncabals, the underbred indignities, direct and indirect, which the\npresent eminent Judge had to watch against, to brush aside, to smile\nat, in course of his epic strides towards the highest local pinnacle of\nhis profession.  But [145] with him, as Time has shown, it was all sure\nand safe.\n\nProvidence had endowed him with the powers and temperament that break\ndown, when opportunity offers, every barrier to the progress of the\ngifted and strong and brave.  That opportunity, in his particular case,\noffered itself in the Confederation crisis.  Distracted and helpless\n\"Anglo-West Indians\" thronged to him in imploring crowds, praying that\ntheir beloved Charter should be saved by the exertion of his\nincomparable abilities.  Save and except Dr. Carrington, there was not\na single member of the dominant section in Barbados whom it would not\nbe absurd to name even as a near second to him whom all hailed as the\nChampion of their Liberties.  In the contest to be waged the victory\nwas not, as it never once has been, reserved to the SKIN or pedigree of\nthe combatants.  The above two matters, which in the eyes of the ruling\n\"Bims\" had, throughout long decades of undisturbed security, been\nplaced before and above all possible considerations, gravitated down to\ntheir inherent insignificance when Intellect and Worth were destined to\nfight out the issue.  Mr. [146] Reeves, whose possession of the\nessential qualifications was admittedly greater than that of every\ncolleague, stood, therefore, in unquestioned supremacy, lord of the\npolitical situation, with the result above stated.\n\nTo what we have already pointed out regarding the absolute\nimpossibility of such an opportunity ever presenting itself in America\nto Mr. Douglass, in a political sense, we may now add that, whereas, in\nBarbados, for the intellectual equipment needed at the crisis, Mr.\nReeves stood quite alone, there could, in the bosom of the Union, even\nin respect of the gifts in which Mr. Douglass was most brilliant, be no\n\"walking over the course\" by him.  It was in the country and time of\nBancroft, Irving, Whittier, Longfellow, Holmes, Bryant, Motley, Henry\nClay, Dan Webster, and others of the laureled phalanx which has added\nso great and imperishable a lustre to the literature of the English\ntongue.\n\nWe proceed here another step, and take up a fresh deliverance of our\nauthor's in reference to the granting of the franchise to the black\npopulation of these Colonies.  \"It is,\" says Mr. James Anthony Froude,\nwho is just as prophetic [147] as his prototypes, the slave-owners of\nthe last half-century, \"it is as certain as anything future can be,\nthat if we give the negroes as a body the political privileges which we\nclaim for ourselves, they will use them only to their own injury.\"  The\nforepart of the above citation reads very much as if its author wrote\nit on the principle of raising a ghost for the mere purpose of laying\nit.  What visionary, what dreamer of impossible dreams, has ever asked\nfor the Negroes as a body the same political privileges which are\nclaimed for themselves by Mr. Froude and others of his countrymen, who\nare presumably capable of exercising them?  No one in the West Indies\nhas ever done so silly a thing as to ask for the Negroes as a body that\nwhich has not, as everybody knows, and never will be, conceded to the\npeople of Great Britain as a body.  The demand for Reform in the Crown\nColonies--a demand which our author deliberately misrepresents--is made\nneither by nor for the Negro, Mulatto, White, Chinese, nor East Indian.\nIt is a petition put forward by prominent responsible colonists--the\nmajority of whom are Whites, and mostly Britons besides.\n\n[148] Their prayer, in which the whole population in these Colonies\nmost heartily join, is simply and most reasonably that we, the said\nColonies, being an integral portion of the British Empire, and having,\nin intelligence and every form of civilized progress, outgrown the\nstage of political tutelage, should be accorded some measure of\nemancipation therefrom.  And thereby we--White, Black, Mulatto, and all\nother inhabitants and tax-payers--shall be able to protect ourselves\nagainst the self-seeking and bold indifference to our interests which\nseem to be the most cherished expression of our rulers' official\nexistence.  It may be possible (for he has attempted it), that our new\ninstructor in Colonial ethics and politics, under the impulsion of\nskin-superiority, and also of confidence in the probable success of\nexperiments successfully tried fifty years before, does really believe\nin the sensibleness of separating COLOURS, and representing the wearers\nof them as being generally antagonistic to one another in Her Majesty's\nWest Indian Dominions. How is it then, we may be permitted to ask Mr.\nFroude, that no complaint of the sort formulated by him as against the\nBlacks has ever been put [149] forward by the thousands of Englishmen,\nScotchmen, Irishmen, and other Europeans who are permanent inhabitants,\nproprietors, and tax-payers of these Colonies?  The reason is that\nAnglo-West Indianism, or rather Colonialism, is the creed of a few\nresidents sharply divisible into two classes in the West Indies.\nLabouring conjointly under race-madness, the first believes that, as\nbeing of the Anglo-Saxon race, they have a right to crow and dominate\nin whatever land they chance to find themselves, though in their own\ncountry they or their forefathers had had to be very dumb dogs indeed.\nThe Colonial Office has for a long time been responsible for the\npresence in superior posts of highly salaried gentry of this category,\nwho have delighted in showing themselves off as the unquestionable\nmasters of those who supply them with the pay that gives them the\nlivelihood and position they so ungratefully requite. These fortunate\nfolk, Mr. Froude avers, are likely to leave our shores in a huff,\nbearing off with them the civilizing influences which their presence so\nsurely guarantees.  Go tell to the marines that the seed of Israel\nflourishing in the borders of [150] Misraim will abandon their\nflourishing district of Goshen through sensitiveness on account of the\nidolatry of the devotees of Isis and Osiris!\n\nThe second and less placable class of \"Englishmen in the West Indies,\"\nwhose final departure our author would have us to believe would\ncomplete the catastrophe to progress in the British Antilles, is very\nimpalpable indeed.  We cannot feel them.  We have failed to even see\nthem.  True, Mr. Froude scouts on their behalf the bare notion of their\ncondescending to meet, on anything like equality, us, whom he and they\npretend (rather anachronistically, at least) to have been their former\nslaves, or servants.  But where, in the name of Heaven, where are these\nsortis de la cuisse de Jupiter, Mr. Froude? If they are invisible,\nmourning in impenetrable seclusion over the impossibility of having, as\ntheir fathers had before them, the luxury of living at the Negroes'\nexpense, shall we Negroes who are in the sunshine of heaven, prepared\nto work and win our way, be anywise troubled in our Jubilee by the\ndrivelling ineptitude which insanely reminds us of the miseries of\nthose who went before us?  We have thus arrived at the cardinal, [151]\nessential misrepresentation, out of scores which compose \"The Bow of\nUlysses,\" and upon which its phrases mainly hinge.  Semper\neadem--\"Always the same\"--has been the proud motto of the mightiest\nhierarchy that has controlled human action and shaped the destinies of\nmankind, no less in material than in ghostly concerns.  Yet is a vast\nand very beneficial change, due to the imperious spirit of the times,\nmanifest in the Roman Church.  No longer do the stake, the sword, and\nthe dismal horrors of the interdict figure as instruments for assuring\nconformity and submission to her dogmas.  She is now content to rest\nher claims on herbeneficence in the past, as attested by noble and\nimperishable memorials of her solicitude for the poor and the ignorant,\nand in proclaiming the gospel without those ghastly coercives to its\nacceptance.  Surely such a change, however unpalatable to those who\nhave been compelled to make it, is most welcome to the outside world at\nlarge.  \"Always the same\" is also, or should be, the device of the\ndiscredited herd whose spokesman Mr. Froude is so proud to be.  In\nnothing has their historical character, as shown in the published\nliterature of their [152] cause up to 1838, exhibited any sign of\namelioration.  It cannot be affected by the spirit and the lessons of\nthe times.  Mendacity and a sort of judicial blindness seem to be the\ntwo most salient characteristics by which are to be distinguished these\nimplacable foes and would-be robbers of human rights and liberty.  But,\ngracious heavens! what can tempt mortals to incur this weight of\ninfamy?  Wealth and Power?  To be (very improbably) a Croesus or (still\nmore improbably) a Bonaparte, and to perish at the conventional age,\nand of vulgar disease, like both?  Turpitudes on the part of sane men,\ninvolving the sacrifice of the priceless attributes of humanity, can be\nrendered intelligible by the supreme temporal gains above indicated,\nbut only if exemption from the common lot of mankind--in the shape of\ncare, disease, and death--were accompaniments of those prizes.\n\nIn favour of slavery, which has for so many centuries desolated the\nAfrican family and blighted its every chance of indigenous progress--of\nslavery whose abolition our author so ostentatiously regrets--only one\nsolitary permanent result, extending in every case over [153] a natural\nhuman life, has been paraded by him as a respectable justification.  At\npage 246, speaking of Negroes met by him during a stroll which he took\nat Mandeville, Jamaica, he tells us:--\n\n\"The people had black faces; but even they had shaped their manners in\nthe old English models.  The men touched their hats respectfully (as\nthey eminently did not in Kingston and its environs).  The women smiled\nand curtsied, and the children looked shy when one spoke to them.  The\nname of slavery is a horror to us; but there must have been something\nhuman and kindly about it, too, when it left upon the character the\nmarks of courtesy and good breeding\"!\n\nAlas for Africa and the sufferings of her desolated millions, in view\nof so light-hearted an assessment as this!  Only think of the ages of\noutrage, misery, and slaughter--of the countless hecatombs that Mammon\nis hereby absolved from having directly exacted, since the sufficing\nexpiatory outcome of it all has been only \"marks of courtesy and good\nbreeding\"!  Marks that are displayed, forsooth, by the survivors of the\nghastly experiences or by [154] their descendants!  And yet, granting\nthe appreciable ethical value of the hat-touching, the smirking and\ncurtseyings of those Blacks to persons whom they had no reason to\nsuspect of unfriendliness, or whose white face they may in the white\nman's country have greeted with a civility perhaps only prudential, we\nfail to discover the necessity of the dreadful agency we have adverted\nto, for securing the results on manners which are so warmly commended.\nAfrican explorers, from Mungo Park to Livingstone and Stanley, have all\nborne sufficient testimony to the world regarding the natural\nfriendliness of the Negro in his ancestral home, when not under the\ninfluence of suspicion, anger, or dread.\n\nIt behoves us to repeat (for our detractor is a persistent repeater)\nthat the cardinal dodge by which Mr. Froude and his few adherents\nexpect to succeed in obtaining the reversal of the progress of the\ncoloured population is by misrepresenting the elements, and their real\nattitude towards one another, of the sections composing the British\nWest Indian communities.  Everybody knows full well that Englishmen,\nScotchmen, and Irishmen (who are not officials), as [155] well as\nGermans, Spaniards, Italians, Portuguese, and other nationalities, work\nin unbroken harmony and, more or less, prosper in these Islands.  These\nare no cherishers of any vain hankering after a state of things in\nwhich men felt not the infamy of living not only on the unpaid labour,\nbut at the expense of the sufferings, the blood, and even the life of\ntheir fellow-men.  These men, honourable by instinct and of independent\nspirit, depend on their own resources for self-advancement in the\nworld--on their capital either of money in their pockets or of\nserviceable brains in their heads, energy in their limbs, and on these\nalone, either singly or more or less in combination.  These reputable\nspecimens of manhood have created homes dear to them in these favoured\nclimes; and they, at any rate, being on the very best terms with all\nsections of the community in which their lot is cast, have a common\ncause as fellow-sufferers under the r\u00c3\u00a9gime of Mr. Froude's official\n\"birds of passage.\"  The agitation in Trinidad tells its own tale.\nThere is not a single black man--though there should have been\nmany--among the leaders of the movement for Reform.  Nevertheless the\nhonourable [156] and truthful author of \"The English in the West\nIndies,\" in order to invent a plausible pretext for his sinister\nlabours of love on behalf of the poor pro-slavery survivals, and\ndespite his knowledge that sturdy Britons are at the head of the\nagitation, coolly tells the world that it is a struggle to secure\n\"negro domination.\"\n\nThe further allegation of our author respecting the black man is\ncurious and, of course, dismally prophetic.  As the reader may perhaps\nrecollect, it is to the effect that granting political power to the\nNegroes as a body, equal in scope \"to that claimed by Us\" (i.e., Mr.\nFroude and his friends), would certainly result in the use of these\npowers by the Negroes to their own injury.  And wherefore? If Mr.\nFroude professes to believe--what is a fact--that there is \"no original\nor congenital difference of capacity\" between the white and the African\nraces, where is the consistency of his urging a contention which\nimplies inferiority in natural shrewdness, as regards their own\naffairs, on the part of black men?  Does this blower of the two\nextremes of temperature in the same breath pretend that the average\nBritish voter is better informed, can see more clearly what is for his\nown advantage, [157] is better able to assess the relative merits of\npersons to be entrusted with the spending of his taxes, and the general\nmanagement of his interests? If Mr. Froude means all this, he is at\nissue not only with his own specific declaration to the contrary, but\nwith facts of overwhelming weight and number showing precisely the\nreverse.  We have personally had frequent opportunities of coming into\ncontact, both in and out of England, with natives of Great Britain, not\nof the agricultural order alone, but very often of the artisan class,\nwhose ignorance of the commonest matters was as dense as it was\ndiscreditable to the land of their birth and breeding.  Are these\npeople included (on account of having his favourite sine qu\u00c3\u00a2 non of a\nfair skin) in the US of this apostle of skin-worship, in the\nindefeasible right to political power which is denied to Blacks by\nreason, or rather non-reason, of their complexion?\n\nThe fact is, that, judging by his own sentiments and those of his\nAnglo-West Indian friends, Mr. Froude calculated on producing an\nimpression in favour of their discreditable views by purposely keeping\nout of sight the numerous European and other sufferers under the yoke\n[158] which he sneers at seeing described by its proper appellation of\n\"a degrading tyranny.\"  The prescriptive unfavourable forecast of our\nauthor respecting political power in the hands of the Blacks may, in\nour opinion, be hailed as a warrant for its bestowal by those in whose\npower that bestowal may be.  As a pro-slavery prophecy, equally dismal\nand equally confident with the hundreds that preceded it, this new\nvaticination may safely be left to be practically dealt with by the\nRace, victimized and maligned, whose real genius and character are\npurposely belied by those who expect to be gainers by the process.\nInvested with political power, the Negroes, Mr. Froude goes on to\nassure his readers, \"will slide back into their old condition, and the\nchance will be gone of lifting them to the level to which we have no\nright to say they are incapable of rising.\"  How touchingly\nsympathetic!  How transcendently liberal and righteous!  But, to speak\nthe truth, is not this solicitude of our cynical defamer on our behalf,\nafter all, a useless waste of emotion on his part?  Timeo Danaos et\ndona ferentes.+  The tears of the crocodile are most copious in close\nview of the banquet on his prey. This [159] reiterated twaddle of Mr.\nFroude, in futile and unseasonable echo of the congenial predictions of\nhis predecessors in the same line, might be left to receive not only\nthe answer of his own book to the selfsame talk of the slavers fifty\nyears ago, but also that of the accumulated refutations which America\nhas furnished for the last twenty-five years as to the retrograde\ntendency so falsely imputed.  But, taking it as a serious contention,\nwe find that it involves a suggestion that the according of electoral\nvotes to citizens of a certain complexion would, per se and ipso facto,\nproduce a revulsion and collapse of the entire prevailing organization\nand order of a civilized community.\n\nWhat talismanic virtue this prophet of evil attributes to a vote in the\nhand of a Negro out of Barbados, where for years the black man's vote\nhas been operating, harmlessly enough, Heaven knows, we cannot imagine.\nAt all events, as sliding back on the part of a community is a matter\nwhich would require some appreciable time, however brief, let us hope\nthat the authorities charged \"to see that the state receive no\ndetriment\" would be vigilant enough and in time to arrest the evil and\nvindicate [160] the efficiency of the civilized methods of\nself-preservation.\n\nOur author concludes by another reference to Chief Justice Reeves: \"Let\nBritish authority die away, and the average black nature, such as it\nnow is, be left free to assert itself, there will be no more negroes\nlike him in Barbadoes or anywhere.\"  How the dying away of British\nauthority in a British Colony is to come to pass, Mr. Froude does not\ncondescend here explicitly to state.  But we are left free to infer\nfrom the whole drift of \"The English in the West Indies\" that it will\ncome through the exodus en masse said to be threatened by his\n\"Anglo-West Indians.\"  Mr. Froude sympathetically justifies the disgust\nand exasperation of these reputable folk at the presence and progress\nof the race for whose freedom and ultimate elevation Britain was so\nlavish of the wealth of her noblest intellects, besides paying the\nprodigious money-ransom of TWENTY MILLION pounds sterling.  With regard\nto our author's talk about \"the average black nature, such as it now\nexists, being left free to assert itself,\" and the dire consequences\ntherefrom to result, we can only feel pity at the desperate straits to\n[161] which, in his search for a pretext for gratuitous slander, a man\nof our author's capacity has been so ignominiously reduced.  All we can\nsay to him with reference to this portion of his violent suppositions\nis that \"the average black nature, such as it now exists,\" should NOT,\nin a civilized community, be left free to assert itself, any more than\nthe average white, the average brown, the average red, or indeed any\naverage colour of human nature whatsoever.  As self-defence is the\nfirst law of nature, it has followed that every condition of organized\nsociety, however simple or primitive, is furnished with some recognized\nmeans of self-protection against the free assertion of itself by the\naverage nature of any of its members.\n\nOf course, if things should ever turn out according to Mr. Froude's\ndesperate hypothesis, it may also happen that there will be no more\nNegroes like Mr. justice Reeves in Barbados.  But the addition of the\nwords \"or anywhere\" to the above statement is just another of those\nsuppressions of the truth which, absolutely futile though they are,\nconstitute the only means by which the policy he writes to promote can\npossibly be made to [162] appear even tolerable.  The assertion of our\nauthor, therefore, standing as it actually does, embracing the whole\nworld, is nothing less than an audacious absurdity, for there stand the\nUnited States, the French and Spanish islands--not to speak of the\nCentral and South American Republics, Mexico, and Brazil--all thronged\nwith black, mixed blood, and even half-breed high officials, staring\nhim and the whole world in the face.\n\nThe above noted suppression of the truth to the detriment of the\nobnoxious population recalls a passage wherein the suggestion of what\nis not the truth has been resorted to for the same purpose.  At page\n123 we read: \"The disproportion of the two races--always dangerously\nlarge--has increased with ever-gathering velocity since the\nemancipation.  It is now beyond control on the old lines.\"  The use of\nthe expletive \"dangerously,\" as suggestive of the truculence of the\npeople to whom it refers, is critically allowable in view of the main\nintention of the author.  But what shall we say of the suggestion\ncontained in the very next sentence, which we have italicized?  We are\nrequired by it to understand that in slavery-time the [163] planters\nhad some organized method, rendered impracticable by the Emancipation,\nof checking, for their own personal safety, the growth of the coloured\npopulation.  If we, in deference to the superior mental capacity of our\nauthor, admit that self-interest was no irresistible motive for\npromoting the growth of the human \"property\" on which their prosperity\ndepended, we are yet at liberty to ask what was the nature of the \"old\nlines\" followed for controlling the increase under discussion.  Was it\nsuffocation of the babes by means of sulphur fumes, the use of\nbeetle-paste, or exposure on the banks of the Caribbean rivers?  In the\nlater case History evidently lost a chance of self-repetition in the\nperson of some leader like Moses, the Hebra-Egyptian Spartacus, arising\nto avenge and deliver his people.\n\nWe now shall note how he proceeds to descant on slavery\nitself:--\"Slavery,\" says he, \"was a survival from a social order which\nhad passed away, and slavery could not be continued.  IT DOES NOT\nFOLLOW THAT per se IT WAS A CRIME.  The negroes who were sold to the\ndealers in the factories were most of them either slaves already to\nworse masters or were servi, servants [164] in the old meaning of the\nword, or else criminals, servati or reserved from death.  They would\notherwise have been killed, and since the slave trade has been\nabolished, are again killed in the too celebrated customs....\"\n\nSlavery, as Mr. Froude and the rest of us are bound to discuss it at\npresent, is by no means susceptible of the gloss which he has\nendeavoured, in the above extract, to put on it.  The British nation,\nin 1834, had to confront and deal with the only species of slavery\nwhich was then within the cognizance of public morals and practical\npolitics.  Doubtless our author, learned and erudite as he is, would\nlike to transport us to those patriarchal ages when, under theocratic\ndecrees, the chosen people were authorized to purchase (not to kidnap)\nslaves, and keep them as an everlasting inheritance in their posterity.\nThe slaves so purchased, we know, became members of the families to\nwhich their lot was attached, and were hedged in from cruel usage by\ndistinct and salutary regulations.  This is the only species of slavery\nwhich--with the addition of the old Germanic self-enslavements and the\ngenerally prevailing ancient custom of pledging one's personal services\n[165] in liquidation of indebtedness--can be covered by the singular\nverdict of noncriminality which our author has pronounced.  He, of\ncourse, knows much better than we do what the condition of slaves was\nin Greece as well as in Rome.  He knows, too, that the \"wild and guilty\nphantasy that man could hold property in man,\" lost nothing of its\nguilt or its wildness with the lapse of time and the changes of\ncircumstances which overtook and affected those reciprocal relations.\nEvery possibility of deterioration, every circumstance wherein man's\nfallen nature could revel in its worst inspirations, reached\nculmination at the period when the interference of the world, decreed\nby Providence, was rendered imperative by the sufferings of the\nbondsmen.  It is this crisis of the history of human enslavement that\nMr. Froude must talk about, if he wishes to talk to any purpose on the\nsubject at all.  His scoffs at British \"virtuous benevolence,\" and his\nimputation of ingratitude to the Negro in respect of that self-same\nbenevolence, do not refer to any theocratic, self-contracted, abstract,\nor idyllic condition of servitude.  They pin his meaning down [166] to\nthat particular phase when slavery had become not only \"the sum,\" but\nthe very quintessence, \"of all human villainies.\"\n\nAt its then phase, slavery had culminated into being a menace,\nportentous and far encroaching, to not only the moral life but the very\ncivilization of the higher types of the human family, so debasing and\nblighting were its effects on those who came into even tolerating\ncontact with its details.  The indescribable atrocities practised on\nthe slaves, the deplorable sapping of even respectable principles in\nowners of both sexes--all these stood forth in their ineffable\nhideousness before the uncorrupted gaze of the moral heroes, sons of\nBritain and America, and also of other countries, who, buckling on the\narmour of civilization and right, fought for the vindication of them\nboth, through every stern vicissitude, and won the first grand,\never-memorable victory of 1838, whereof we so recently celebrated the\nwelcome Jubilee!  Oh! it was a combat of archangels against the legions\nthat Mammon had banded together and incited to the conflict.  But\nthough it was Sharp, Clarkson, Wilberforce, and the rest [167] of that\nillustrious host of cultured, lofty-souled, just, merciful, and\nbeneficent men, who were thus the saviours, as well as the servants, of\nsociety, yet have we seen it possible for an Englishman of to-day to\nmouth against their memory the ineptitudes of their long-vanquished\nfoes, and to flout the consecrated dead in their graves, as the\nBoeotian did the living Pericles in the market-place of Athens!\n\nWhy waste words and time on this defamer of his own countrymen, who, on\naccount of the material gain and the questionable martial glory of the\nconquest, eulogizes Warren Hastings, the viceregal plunderer of India,\nwhilst, in the same breath, he denounces Edmund Burke for upholding the\nimmutable principles of right and justice!  These principles once, and\nindubitably now, so precious in their fullest integrity to the normal\nBritish conscience, must henceforth, say Mr. Froude and his\nfellow-colonialists, be scored off the moral code of Britain, since\nthey \"do not pay\" in tangible pelf, in self-aggrandisement, or in\ndazzling prestige.\n\nThe statement that many negroes who were sold to the dealers in the\nfactories were \"slaves [168] already to worse masters\" is, in the face\nof facts which could not possibly have been unknown to him, a piece of\nvery daring assertion.  But this should excite no wonder, considering\nthat precise and scrupulous accuracy would be fatal to the\ndiscreditable cause to which he so shamelessly proclaims his adhesion.\nAs being familiar since early childhood with members of almost every\ntribe of Africans (mainly from or arriving by way of the West Coast)\nwho were brought to our West Indies, we are in a position to contradict\nthe above assertion of Mr. Froude's, its unfaltering confidence\nnotwithstanding.  We have had the Madingoes, Foulahs, Houssas, Calvers,\nGallahs, Karamenties, Yorubas, Aradas, Cangas, Kroos, Timnehs, Veis,\nEboes, Mokoes, Bibis, and Congoes, as the most numerous and important\nof the tribal contribution of Africa to the population of these\nColonies.  Now, from what we have intimately learned of these people\n(excepting the Congoes, who always appeared to us an inferior tribe to\nall the others), we unhesitatingly deny that even three in ten of the\nwhole number were ever slaves in their own country, in the sense of\nhaving been born under any organized [169] system of servitude.  The\nauthentic records relating to the enslavement of Africans, as a regular\nsystematized traffic, do not date further back than five centuries ago.\nIt is true that a great portion of ancient literature and many\nmonuments bear distinct evidence, all the more impressive because\nfrequently only casual, that, from the earliest ages, the Africans had\nshared, in common with other less civilized peoples, the doom of having\nto furnish the menial and servile contingents of the more favoured\nsections of the human family.  Now, dating from, say, five hundred\nyears ago, which was long indeed after the disappearance of the old\nleading empires of the world, we have (save and except in the case of\nArab incursionists into the Eastern and Northern coasts) no reliable\nauthority for saying, or even for supposing, that the tribes of the\nAfrican interior suffered from the molestations of professional\nman-hunters.\n\nIt was the organization of the West Coast slave traffic towards the\nclose of the sixteenth century, and the extermination of the Caribbean\naborigines by Spain, soon after Columbus had discovered the Western\nContinent, which [170] gave cohesion, system, impetus, and\naggressiveness to the trade in African flesh and blood.  Then the\nfactory dealers did not wait at their seaboard mart, as our author\nwould have us suppose, for the human merchandize to be brought down to\nthem.  The auri sacra fames, the accursed craving for gain, was too\nimperious for that.  From the Atlantic border to as far inland as their\nemissaries could penetrate, their bribes, in every species of\nexchangeable commodities, were scattered among the rapacious chiefs on\nthe river banks; while these latter, incited as well by native ferocity\nas by lust of gain, rushed forth to \"make war\" on their neighbours, and\nto kidnap, for sale to the white purchaser, every man, woman, and child\nthey could capture amidst the nocturnal flames, confusion, tumult, and\nterror resulting from their unexpected irruption.  That the poor people\nthus captured and sold into foreign on age were under worse masters\nthan those under whom they, on being actually bought and becoming\nslaves, were doomed to experience all the atrocities that have thrilled\nwith horror the conscience of the civilized Christian world, is a\nstatement of worse than [171] childish absurdity.  Every one, except\nMr. Froude and his fellow-apologists for slavery, knows that the\ncruelty of savage potentates is summary, uncalculating, and, therefore,\nmerciful in its ebullitions.  A head whisked off, brains dashed out, or\nsome other short form of savage dispatch, is the preferential method of\ndestruction.  With our author's better masters, there was the long,\ndreary vicissitude, beginning from the horrors of the capture, and\nending perhaps years upon years after, in some bush or under the lash\nof the driver.  The intermediate stages of the starvation life of\nhunger, chains, and hideous exposure at the barancoon, the stowing away\nlike herrings on board the noisome ship, the suffocation, the\ndeck-sores wrought into the body by the attrition of the bonier parts\nof the system against the unyielding wood--all these, says Mr. Froude,\nwere more tolerable than the swift doing away with life under an\nAfrican master!  Under such, at all events, the care and comfort\nsuitable to age were strictly provided for, and cheered the advanced\nyears of the faithful bondsman.\n\nAfter a good deal of talk, having the same logical value, our author,\nin his enthusiasm for [172] slavery, delivers himself thus: \"For\nmyself, I would rather be the slave of a Shakespeare or a Burghley,\nthan the slave of a majority in the House of Commons, or the slave of\nmy own folly.\"  Of the four above specified alternatives of\nenslavement, it is to be regretted that temperament, or what is more\nlikely, perhaps, self-interest, has driven him to accept the fourth, or\nthe latter of the two deprecated yokes, his book being an irrefutable\ntestimony to the fact.  For, most assuredly, it has not been at the\nprompting of wisdom that a learned man of unquestionably brilliant\ntalents and some measure of accorded fame could have prostituted those\ntalents and tarnished that fame by condescending to be the literary\nspokesman of the set for whose miserable benefit he recommends the\nstatesmen of his country to perjure and compromise themselves,\nregardless of inevitable consequences, which the value of the sectional\nsatisfaction to be thereby given would but very poorly compensate.\nPossibly a House of Commons majority, whom this dermatophilist\nevidently rates far lower than his \"Anglo-West Indians,\" might, if he\nwere their Slave, have protected their own self- [173] respect by\nrestraining him from vicariously scandalizing them by his effusions.\n\nAfter this curious boast about his preferences as a hypothetic\nbondsman, Mr. Froude proceeds gravely to inform his readers that \"there\nmay be authority yet not slavery; a soldier is not a slave, a wife is\nnot a slave...\" and he continues, with a view of utilizing these\nplatitudes against the obnoxious Negro, by telling us that persons\nsustaining the above specified and similar relations \"may not live by\ntheir own wills, or emancipate themselves at their own pleasure from\npositions in which nature has placed them, or into which they have\nthemselves voluntarily entered.  The negroes of the West Indies are\nchildren, and not yet disobedient children.... If you enforce\nself-government upon them when they are not asking for it, you may ...\nwilfully drive them back into the condition of their ancestors, from\nwhich the slave-trade was the beginning of their emancipation.\"!  The\nwords which we have signalized by italics in the above extract could\nhave been conceived only by a bigot--such an atrocious sentiment being\npossible only as the product of mind or morals [174] wrenched\nhopelessly out of normal action.  All the remainder of this hashing up\nof pointless commonplaces has for its double object a suggestio falsi\nagainst us Negroes as a body, and a diverting of attention, as we have\nproved before, from the numerous British claimants of Reform, whose\npersonality Mr. Froude and his friends would keep out of view, provided\ntheir crafty policy has the result of effectually repressing the\nhitherto irrepressible, and, as such, to the \"Anglo-West Indian,\" truly\ndetestable Negro.\n\nNOTES\n\n158. +Translation: \"I fear the Greeks even when they bear gifts.\"\n\n\n\nBOOK III: WEST INDIAN CONFEDERATION\n\n[175] In heedless formulation of his reasons, if such they should be\ntermed, for urging tooth and nail the non-according of reform to the\nCrown-governed Colonies, our author puts forth this dogmatic\ndeliverance (p. 123):--\n\n\"A West Indian self-governing dominion is possible only with a full\nNegro vote.  If the whites are to combine, so will the blacks.  It will\nbe a rule by the blacks and for the blacks.\"\n\nThat a constitution for any of our diversely populated Colonies which\nmay be fit for it is possible only with \"a full Negro vote\" (to the\nextent within the competence of such voting), goes without saying, as\nmust be the case with every section of the Queen's subjects eligible\nfor the franchise.  The duly qualified Spaniard, [176] Coolie,\nPortuguese, or man of any other non-British race, will each thus have a\nvote, the same as every Englishman or any other Briton.  Why, then,\nshould the vote of the Negro be so especially a bugbear?  It is because\nthe Negro is the game which our political sportsman is in full chase\nof, and determined to hunt down at any cost.  Granted, however, for the\nsake of argument, that black voters should preponderate at any\nelection, what then?  We are gravely told by this latter-day Balaam\nthat \"If the whites are to combine, so will the blacks,\" but he does\nnot say for what purpose.\n\nHis sentence, therefore, may be legitimately constructed in full for\nhim in the only sense which is applicable to the mutual relations\nactually existing between those two directly specified sections of\nBritish subjects who he would fain have the world believe live in a\nstate of active hostility:--\"If the whites are to combine for the\nPromotion of the general welfare, as many of the foremost of them have\ndone before and are doing now, so will the blacks also combine in the\nsupport of such whites, and as staunch auxiliaries equally interested\nin the furtherance of the same ameliorative [177] objects.\"  Except in\nthe sense embodied in the foregoing sentence, we cannot, in these days,\nconceive with what intent persons of one section should so specially\ncombine as to compel combination on the part of persons of any other.\nThe further statement that a confederation having a full black\nvoting-power would be a government \"by the blacks and for the blacks,\"\nis the logical converse of the now obsolete doctrine of Mr. Froude's\ninspirers--\"a government by whites should be only for whites.\"  But\nthis formula, however strenuously insisted on by those who gave it\nshape, could never, since even before three decades from the first\nintroduction of African slaves, be thoroughly put in practice, so\ncompletely had circumstances beyond man's devising or control compelled\nthe altering of men's minds and methods with regard to the new\ninterests which had irresistibly forced themselves into importance as\nvital items in political arrangements.  Nowadays, therefore, that Mr.\nFroude should desire to create a state of feeling which had, and could\nhave had, no existence with regard to the common interests of the\ninhabitants for upwards of two full centuries, is [178] evidently an\nexcess of confidence which can only be truly described as amazing.\nBut, after all, what does our author mean by the words \"a government by\nthe blacks?\"  Are we to understand him as suggesting that voting by\nblack electors would be synonymous with electing black representatives?\nIf so, he has clearly to learn much more than he has shown that he\nlacks, in order to understand and appreciate the vital influences at\nwork in West Indian affairs.  Undoubtedly, being the spokesman of few\nwho (secretly) avow themselves to be particularly hostile to\nEthiopians, he has done no more than reproduce their sentiments. For,\nconscious, as these hankerers after the old \"institutions\" are, of\nbeing utterly ineligible for the furthering of modern progressive\nideas, they revenge themselves for their supersession on everybody and\neverything, save and except their own arrogant stolidity.  White\nindividuals who have part and lot in the various Colonies, with their\nhearts and feelings swayed by affections natural to their birth and\nearliest associations; and Whites who have come to think the land of\ntheir adoption as dear to themselves as the land of their birth,\nentertain no such dread of [179] their fellow-citizens of any other\nsection, whom they estimate according to intelligence and probity, and\nnot according to any accident of exterior physique.  Every intelligent\nblack is as shrewd regarding his own interests as our author himself\nwould be regarding his in the following hypothetical case: Some fine\nday, being a youth and a bachelor, he gets wedded, sets up an\nestablishment, and becomes the owner of a clipper yacht. For his own\nservice in the above circumstances we give him the credit to believe\nthat, on the persons specified below applying among others to him for\nemployment, as chamber-maid and house-servant, and also as hands for\nthe vessel, he would, in preference to any ordinarily recommended white\napplicants, at once engage the two black servant-girls at President\nChurchill's in Dominica, the droghermen there as able seamen, and as\ncabin-boy the lad amongst them whose precocious marine skill he has so\nwarmly and justly extolled.  It is not because all these persons are\nblack, but because of the soul-consciousness of the selector, that they\neach (were they even blue) had a title to preferential consideration,\nhis experience and sense of fitness being [180] their most effectual\nsupporters.  Similarly, the Negro voter would elect representatives\nwhom he knew he could trust for competency in the management of his\naffairs, and not persons whose sole recommendation to him would be the\npossession of the same kind of skin.  Nor, from what we know of matters\nin the West Indies, do we believe that any white man of the class we\nhave eulogized would hesitate to give his warmest suffrage to any black\ncandidate who he knew would be a fitting representative of his\ninterests.  We could give examples from almost every West Indian island\nof white and coloured men who would be indiscriminately chosen as their\ncandidate by either section.  But the enumeration is needless, as the\nfact of the existence of such men is too notorious to require proof.\n\nMr. Froude states plainly enough (p. 123) that, whereas a whole\nthousand years were needed to train and discipline the Anglo-Saxon\nrace, yet \"European government, European instruction, continued\nsteadily till his natural tendencies are superseded by a higher\ninstinct, may shorten the probation period of the negro.\"  Let it be\nsupposed that this period of probation [181] for the Negro should\nextend, under such exceptionally favourable circumstances, to any\nperiod less than that which is alleged to have been needed by the\nAnglo-Saxon to attain his political manhood--what then are the\nprospects held out by Mr. Froude to us and our posterity on our\nmastering the training and discipline which he specially recommends for\nBlacks?  Our author, in view, doubtless, of the rapidity of our onward\nprogress, and indeed our actual advancement in every respect, thus\nanswers (pp. 123-4):--\"Let a generation or two pass by and carry away\nwith them the old traditions, and an English governor-general will be\nfound presiding over a black council, delivering the speeches made for\nhim by a black prime minister; and how long could this endure?  No\nEnglish gentleman would consent to occupy so absurd a situation.\"\n\nAnd again, more emphatically, on the same point (p. 285):--\"No\nEnglishman, not even a bankrupt peer, would consent to occupy such\nposition; the blacks themselves would despise him if he did; and if the\ngovernor is to be one of their own race and colour, how long would such\na connection endure?\"\n\n[182] It is plainly to be seen from the above two extracts that the\npolitical ethics of our author, being based on race and colour\nexclusively, would admit of no conceivable chance of real elevation to\nany descendant of Africa, who, being Ethiopian, could not possibly\nchange his skin.  The \"old traditions\" which Mr. Froude supposes to be\ncarried away by his hypothetical (white) generations who have \"passed\nby,\" we readily infer from his language, rendered impossible such\nincarnations of political absurdity as those he depicts.  But what\nshould be thought of the sense, if not indeed the sanity, of a grave\npolitical teacher who prescribes \"European government\" and \"European\neducation\" as the specifics to qualify the Negro for political\nemancipation, and who, when these qualifications are conspicuously\nmastered by the Negro who has undergone the training, refuses him the\nprize, because he is a Negro?  We see further that, in spite of being\nfit for election to council, and even to be prime ministers competent\nto indite governors' messages, the pigment under our epidermis dooms us\nto eventual disappointment and a life-long condition of contempt.  Even\nso is it [183] desired by Mr. Froude and his clients, and not without a\nspice of piquancy is their opinion that for a white ruler to preside\nand rule over and accept the best assistance of coloured men, qualified\nas above stated, would be a self-degradation too unspeakable for\ntoleration by any Englishman--\"even a bankrupt peer.\"  Unfortunately\nfor Mr. Froude, we can point him to page 56 of this his very book,\nwhere, speaking of Grenada and deprecating the notion of its official\nabandonment, our author says:--\n\n\"Otherwise they [Negroes] were quiet fellows, and if the politicians\nwould only let them alone, they would be perfectly contented, and might\neventually, if wisely managed, come to some good.... Black the island\nwas, and black it would remain.  The conditions were never likely to\narise which would bring back a European population; but a governor who\nwas a sensible man, who would reside and use his natural influence,\ncould manage it with perfect ease.\"\n\nHere, then, we see that the governor of an entirely black population\nmay be a sensible man, and yet hold the post.  Our author, indeed,\ngives the Blacks over whom this sensible governor would hold rule as\nbeing in number [184] just 40,000 souls; and we are therefore bound to\naccept the implied suggestion that the dishonour of holding supremacy\nover persons of the odious colour begins just as their number begins to\ncount onward from 40,000!  There is quite enough in the above verbal\nvagaries of our philosopher to provoke a volume of comment.  But we\nmust pass on to further clauses of this precious paragraph.  Mr.\nFroude's talent for eating his own words never had a more striking\nillustration than here, in his denial of the utility of native\nexperience as the safest guide a governor could have in the\nadministration of Colonial affairs.  At page 91 he says:--\"Among the\npublic servants of Great Britain there are persons always to be found\nfit and willing for posts of honour and difficulty, if a sincere effort\nbe made to find them.\"\n\nA post of honour and difficulty, we and all other persons in the\nBritish dominions had all along understood was regarded as such in the\ncase of functionaries called upon to contend with adverse forces in the\naccomplishment of great ends conceived by their superiors. But we find\nthat, according to Mr. Froude, all the credit that has hitherto\nredounded to those [185] who had succeeded in such tasks has been in\nreality nothing more than a gilding over of disgrace, whenever the\nexertions of such officials had been put forth amongst persons not\nwearing a European epidermis.  The extension of British influence and\ndominion over regions inhabited by races not white is therefore, on the\npart of those who promote it, a perverse opening of arenas for the\nhumiliation and disgrace of British gentlemen, nay, even of those\ntitled members of the \"black sheep\" family--bankrupt peers!  As we have\nseen, however, ample contradiction and refutation have been\nconsiderately furnished by the same objector in this same volume, as in\nhis praises of the governor just quoted.\n\nThe cavil of Mr. Froude about English gentlemen reading messages penned\nby black prime ministers applies with double force to English\nbarristers (who are gentlemen by statute) receiving the law from the\nlips of black Judges.\n\nFor all that, however, an emergency arose so pressing as to compel even\nthe colonialism of Barbados to practically and completely refute this\ndoctrine, by praying for, and submitting with gratitude to, the supreme\nheadship of a [186] man of the race which our author so finically\ndepreciates.  In addition it may be observed that for a governor to\neven consult his prime minister in the matter of preparing his messages\nmight conceivably be optional, whilst it is obligatory on all\nbarristers, whether English or otherwise, to defer to the judge's\ninterpretation of the law in every case--appeal afterwards being the\nonly remedy.  As to the dictum that \"the two races are not equal and\nwill not blend,\" it is open to the fatal objection that, having himself\nproved, with sympathizing pathos, how the West Indies are now well-nigh\ndenuded of their Anglo-Saxon inhabitants, Mr. Froude would have us also\nunderstand that the miserable remnant who still complainingly inhabit\nthose islands must, by doing violence to the understanding, be taken as\nthe whole of the world-pervading Anglo-Saxon family.  The Negroes of\nthe West Indies number a good deal more than two million souls.  Does\nthis suggester of extravagances mean that the prejudices and vain\nconceit of the few dozens whom he champions should be made to override\nand overbear, in political arrangements, the serious and solid\ninterests of so many [187] hundreds of thousands?  That \"the two races\nare not equal\" is a statement which no sane man would dispute, but\nacquiescence in its truth involves also a distinct understanding that\nthe word race, as applied in the present case by our author, is a\nsimple accommodation of terms--a fashion of speech having a very\nrestricted meaning in this serious discussion.\n\nThe Anglo-Saxon race pervades Great Britain, its cradle, and the\nGreater Britain extending almost all over the face of the earth, which\nis the arena of its activities and marvellous achievements.  To tell\nus, therefore, as Mr. Froude does, that the handful of malcontents\nwhose unrespectable grievance he holds up to public sympathy represents\nthe Anglo-Saxon race, is a grotesque fa\u00c3\u00a7on de parler.  Taking our\nauthor's \"Anglo-West Indians\" and the people of Ethiopian descent\nrespectively, it would not be too much to assert, nor in anywise\ndifficult to prove by facts and figures, that for every competent\nindividual of the former section in active civilized employments, the\ncoloured section can put forward at least twenty thoroughly competent\nrivals.  Yet are these latter the people whom the classic Mr. [188]\nFroude wishes to be immolated, root and branch, in all their highest\nand dearest interests, in order to secure the maintenance of \"old\ntraditions\" which, he tells us, guaranteed for the dominant cuticle the\nsacrifice of the happiness of down-trodden thousands!  Referring to his\nhypothetical confederation with its black officeholders, our author\nscornfully asks:--\n\n\"And how long would this endure?\"\n\nThe answer must be that, granting the existence of such a state of\nthings, its duration would be not more nor less than under white\nfunctionaries.  For according to himself (p. 124): \"There is no\noriginal or congenital difference of capacity between\" the white and\nblack races, and \"with the same chances and the same treatment, ...\ndistinguished men would be produced equally from both races.\"\n\nIf, therefore, the black ministers whose hue he so much despises do\npossess the training and influence rendering them eligible and securing\ntheir election to the situations we are considering, it must follow\nthat their tenure of office would be of equal duration with that of\nindividuals of the white race under the same conditions.  Not content\nwith making himself [189] the mouthpiece of English gentlemen in this\nmatter, our author, with characteristic hardihood, obtrudes himself\ninto the same post on behalf of Negroes; saying that, in the event of\neven a bankrupt peer accepting the situation of governor-general over\nthem, \"The blacks themselves would despise him\"!\n\nMr. Froude may pertinently be asked here the source whence he derived\nhis certainty on this point, inasmuch as it is absolutely at variance\nwith all that is sensible and natural; for surely it is both foolish\nand monstrous to suppose that educated men would infer the degradation\nof any one from the fact of such a one consenting to govern and\nco-operate with themselves for their own welfare.  He further asks on\nthe same subject:--\n\n\"And if the governor is to be one of their own race and colour, how\nlong could such a connection endure?\"\n\nOur answer must be the same as with regard to the duration of the black\ncouncil and black prime minister carrying out the government under the\nsame conditions.  It must be regretted that no indication in his book,\nso far as it professes to deal with facts and with [190] persons not\nwithin the circle of his clients, would justify a belief that its\nwanton misstatements have filtrated through a mind entitled to declare,\nwith the authority of self-consciousness, what a gentleman would or\nwould not do under given circumstances.\n\nIn reiteration of his favourite doctrine of the antagonism between the\nblack and white races, our author continues on the same page to say:--\n\n\"No one, I presume, would advise that the whites of the island should\ngovern.  The relations between the two populations are too embittered,\nand equality once established by law, the exclusive privilege of colour\nover colour cannot be restored.  While slavery continued, the whites\nruled effectively and economically; the blacks are now as they.\"\n\nAs far as could possibly be endeavoured, every proof has been crowded\ninto this book in refutation of this favourite allegation of Mr.\nFroude's.  It is only an idle waste of time to be thus harping on his\ncolour topic.  No one can deserve to govern simply because he is white,\nand no one is bound to be subject simply because he is black. The whole\nof West [191] Indian history, even after the advent of the\nattorney-class, proves this, in spite of the efforts to secure\nexclusive white domination at a time when crude political power might\nhave secured it.\n\n\"The relations between the two populations are too embittered,\" says\nMr. Froude.  No doubt his talk on this point would be true, had any\nsuch skin-dominancy as he contemplates been officially established; but\nas at present most officials are appointed (locally at least) according\nto their merit, and not to their epidermis, nothing is known of the\nembittered relations so constantly dinned into our ears. Whatever\nbitterness exists is in the minds of those gentry who would like to be\ndominant on the cheap condition of showing a simple bodily accident\nerected by themselves into an evidence and proof of superiority.\n\n\"The exclusive privilege of colour over colour cannot be restored.\"\nNever in the history of the British West Indies--must we again\nstate--was there any law or usage establishing superiority in\nprivileges for any section of the community on account of colour.  This\nstatement of fact is also and again an answer to, and refutation of,\nthe succeeding allegation [192] that, \"While slavery continued, the\nwhites ruled effectively and economically.\"  It will be yet more\nclearly shown in a later part of this essay that during slavery, in\nfact for upwards of two centuries after its introduction, the West\nIndies were ruled by slave-owners, who happened to be of all colours,\nthe means of purchasing slaves and having a plantation being the one\nexclusive consideration in the case.  It is, therefore, contrary to\nfact to represent the Whites exclusively as ruling, and the Blacks\nindiscriminately as subject.\n\nHe goes on to say, \"There are two classes in the community; their\ninterests are opposite as they are now understood.\"  As regards the\nabove, Mr. Froude's attention may be called to the fact that\nclassification in no department of science has ever been based on\ncolour, but on relative affinity in certain salient qualities.  To use\nhis own figure, no horse or dog is more or less a horse or dog because\nit happens to be white or black.  No teacher marshals his pupils into\nclasses according to any outward physical distinction, but according to\nintellectual approximation.  In like manner there has been wealth for\nhundreds of men of Ethiopic origin, [193] and poverty for hundreds of\nmen of Caucasian origin, and the reverse in both cases.  We have,\ntherefore, had hundreds of black as well as white men who, under\nprovidential dispensation, belonged to the class, rich men; while, on\nthe other hand, we have had hundreds of white men who, under\nprovidential dispensation, belonged to the class, poor men.  Similarly,\nin the composition of a free mixed community, we have hundreds of both\nraces belonging to the class, competent and eligible; and hundreds of\nboth races belonging to the class, incompetent and ineligible: to both\nof which classes all possible colours might belong.  It is from the\nfirst mentioned that are selected those who are to bear the rule, to\nwhich the latter class is, in the very nature of things, bound to be\nsubject.  There is no government by reason merely of skins.  The\ndiversity of individual intelligence and circumstances is large enough\nto embrace the possibility of even children being, in emergencies, the\nmost competent influencers of opinion and action.\n\nBut let us analyse this matter for just a while more.  The fatal\nobjection to all Mr. Froude's advocacy of colour-domination is that\n[194] it is futile from being morally unreasonable.  In view of the\nnatural and absolute impossibility of reviving the same external\nconditions under which the inordinate deference and submission to white\npersons were both logically and inevitably engendered and maintained,\nhis efforts to talk people into a frame of mind favourable to his views\non this subject are but a melancholy waste of well-turned sentences.\nMan's estimate of his fellow-man has not and never can have any other\nstandard, save and except what is the outcome of actual circumstances\ninfluencing his sentiment.  In the primitive ages, when the fruits of\nthe earth formed the absorbing object of attention and interest, the\nmen most distinguished for successful culture of the soil enjoyed, as a\nconsequence, a larger share than others of popular admiration and\nesteem.  Similarly, among nomadic tribes, the hunters whose courage\ncoped victoriously with the wild and ferocious denizens of the forest\nbecame the idols of those who witnessed and were preserved by such\nsylvan exploits.  When men came at length to venture in ships over the\ntrackless deep in pursuit of commerce and its gains, the mariner grew\nimportant in [195] public estimation.  The pursuit of commerce and its\ngains led naturally to the possession of wealth.  This, from the\nquasi-omnipotence with which it invests men--enabling them not only to\ncommand the best energies, but also, in many cases, to subvert the very\nprinciples of their fellows--has, in the vast majority of cases, an\noverpowering sway on human opinion: a sway that will endure till the\nMillennium shall have secured for the righteous alone the sovereignty\nof the world.  Likewise, as cities were founded and constitutions\nestablished, those who were foremost as defenders of the national\ninterests, on the field of bodily conflict or in the intellectual\narena, became in the eyes of their contemporaries worthiest of\nappreciation--and so on of other circumstances through which particular\npersonal distinctions created claims to preference.\n\nIn the special case of the Negroes kidnapped out of Africa into foreign\nbondage, the crowning item in their assessment of their alien enslavers\nwas the utter superiority, over their most redoubtable \"big men,\" which\nthose enslavers displayed.  They actually subjugated and put in chains,\nlike the commonest peasants, native [196] potentates at whose very\nnames even the warriorhood of their tribes had been wont to blench.\nBut far surpassing even this in awful effect was the doom meted out to\nthe bush-handlers, the medicine-men, the rain-compellers, erewhile so\ninscrutably potent for working out the bliss or the bale of friend or\nenemy.  \"Lo, from no mountain-top, from no ceiba-hollow in the forest\nrecesses, has issued any interposing sign, any avenging portent, to\nvindicate the Spirit of Darkness so foully outraged in the hitherto\ninviolate person of his chosen minister! Verily, even the powers of the\nmidnight are impotent against these invaders from beyond the mighty\nsalt-water!  Here, huddled together in confused, hopeless misery and\nruin, lie, fettered and prostrate, even priest as well as potentate,\nundistinguishable victims of crude, unblenching violence, with its\nclimax of nefarious sacrilege.  We, common mortals, therefore, can hope\nfor no deliverance from, or even succour in, the woful plight thus\ndismally contrived for us all by the fair-skinned race who have now\nbecome our masters.\"  Such was naturally the train of thought that ran\nthrough those forlorn bosoms. The formidable death-dealing guns [197]\nof the invaders, the ships which had brought them to the African\nshores, and much besides in startling contrast to their own condition\nof utter helplessness, the Africans at once interpreted to themselves\nas the manifestation and inherent attributes of beings of a higher\norder than man.  Their skin, too, the difference whereof from their own\nhad been accentuated by many calamitous incidents, was hit upon as the\nreason of so crushing an ascendency.\n\nWhite skin therefore became, in those disconsolate eyes, the symbol of\nfearful irresistible power: which impression was not at all weakened\nafterwards by the ineffable atrocities of the \"middle-passage.\"  Backed\nultimately by their absolute and irresponsible masterhood at home over\nthe deported Blacks, the European abductors could easily render\npermanent in the minds of their captives the abject terror struck into\nthem by the enormities of which they had been the victims.  Now, the\nimpressions we touched upon before bringing forward the case of the\nNegro slaves were mainly produced by pleasurable circumstances.  But of\na contrary nature and much more deeply graven are those sentiments\nwhich are the outcome of hopeless terror [198] and pain.  For whilst\nimpressions of the former character glide into the consciousness\nthrough accesses no less normal than agreeable, the infusion of fear by\nmeans of bodily suffering is a process too violent to be forgotten by\nminds tortured and strained to unnatural tension thereby.  Such\ntension, oft-recurrent and scarcely endurable, leaves behind it\nrecollections which are in themselves a source of sadness.  But time,\nfavoured by a succession of pleasurable experiences, is a sovereign\nanodyne to remembrances of this poignant class.  No wonder, then, from\nour foregoing detail of facts, that whiteness of skin was both\nredoubted and tremblingly crouched to by Negroes on whom Europeans had\nwrought such unspeakable calamities.  Time, however, and the action of\ncircumstances, especially in countries subject to Catholic dominion,\nsoon began to modify the conditions under which this sentiment of\nterror had been maintained, and, with those conditions, the very\nsentiment itself.  For it was not long in the life of many of the\nexpatriated Africans before numbers of their own race obtained freedom,\nand, eventually, wealth sufficient for purchasing black slaves on their\n[199] own account.  In other respects, too (outwardly at least), the\nprosperous career of such individual Blacks could not fail to induce a\nrevulsion of thought, whereby the attribution of unapproachable powers\nexclusively to the Whites became a matter earnestly reconsidered by the\nAfricans.  Centuries of such reconsideration have produced the natural\nresult in the West Indies. With the daily competition in intelligence,\nrefinement, and social and moral distinction, which time and events\nhave brought about between individuals of the two races, nothing,\nsurely, has resulted, nor has even been indicated, to re-infuse the\nancient colour-dread into minds which had formerly been forced to\nentertain it; and still less to engender it in bosoms to which such a\nfeeling cannot, in the very nature of things, be an inborn emotion.\nNow, can Mr. Froude show us by what process he would be able to infuse\nin the soul of an entire population a sentiment which is both unnatural\nand beyond compulsion?\n\nThe foregoing remarks roughly apply to preeminence given to outward\ndistinction, and the conditions under which mainly it impresses and is\naccepted by men not yet arrived at the [200] essentially intellectual\nstage.  In the spiritual domain the conditions have ever been quite\ndifferent.  A belief in the supernatural being inborn in man, the\nprofessors of knowledge and powers beyond natural attainment were by\ncommon consent accorded a distinct and superior consideration, deemed\nproper to the sacredness of their progression. Hence the supremacy of\nthe priestly caste in every age and country of the world.  Potentate as\nwell as peasant have bowed in reverence before it, as representing and\ndeclaring with authority the counsels of that Being whom all, priest,\npotentate and peasant alike, acknowledge and adore, each according to\nthe measure of his inward illumination.\n\n\n\nBOOK III: THE NEGRO AS WORKER\n\n[201] The laziness, the incurable idleness, of the Negro, was, both\nimmediately before their emancipation in 1838, and for long years after\nthat event, the cuckoo-cry of their white detractors.  It was laziness,\npure and simple, which hindered the Negro from exhausting himself under\na tropical sun, toiling at starvation wages to ensure for his quondam\nmaster the means of being an idler himself, with the additional luxury\nof rolling in easily come-by wealth.  Within the last twenty years,\nhowever, the history of the Black Man, both in the West Indies and,\nbetter still, in the United States of America, has been a succession of\nachievements which have converted the charge of laziness into a\nbaseless and absurd calumny.  The repetition of the charge referred to\nis, in these [202] waning days of the nineteenth century, a discredited\nanachronism, which, however, has no deterring features for Mr. Froude.\nAs the running down of the Negro was his cue, he went in boldly for the\ngame, with what result we shall presently see.  At page 239, our\nauthor, speaking of the Negro garden-farms in Jamaica, says:--\n\n\"The male proprietors were lounging about smoking.  Their wives, as it\nwas market-day, were tramping into Kingston with their baskets on their\nheads.  We met them literally in thousands, all merry and\nlight-hearted, their little ones with little baskets trudging at their\nside.  Of the lords of the creation we saw, perhaps, one to each\nhundred of the women, and he would be riding on mule or donkey, pipe in\nmouth and carrying nothing.  He would be generally sulky too, while the\nladies, young and old, had a civil word for us, and curtsied under\ntheir loads.  Decidedly if there is to be a black constitution I will\ngive my vote to the women.\"\n\nTo the above direct imputation of indolence, heartlessness, and\nmoroseness, Mr. Froude appends the following remarks on other moral\ncharacteristics of certain sable peasants at [203] Mandeville, Jamaica,\ngiven on the authority of a police official, who, our author says,\ndescribed them as--\n\n\"Good-humoured, but not universally honest.  They stole cattle, and\nwould not give evidence against each other.  If brought into Court,\nthey held a pebble in their mouth, being under the impression that when\nthey were so provided, perjury did not count.  Their education was only\nskin-deep, and the schools which the Government provided had not\ntouched their characters at all.\"\n\nBut how could the education so provided be otherwise than futile when\nthe administration of its details is entirely in the hands of persons\nunsympathizing with and utterly despising the Negro?  But of this more\nanon and elsewhere.  We resume Mr. Froude's evidence respecting the\nblack peasantry.  Our author proceeds to admit, on the same subject,\nthat his informant's duties (as a police official) \"brought him in\ncontact with the unfavourable specimens.\"  He adds:--\n\n\"I received a far pleasanter impression from a Moravian minister.... I\nwas particularly glad to see this gentleman, for of the Moravians [204]\nevery one had spoken well to me.  He was not the least enthusiastic\nabout his poor black sheep, but he said that if they were not better\nthan the average English labourer, he did not think them worse.  They\nwere called idle; they would work well enough if they had fair wages\nand if the wages were paid regularly; but what could be expected when\nwomen servants had but three shillings a week and found themselves,\nwhen the men had but a shilling a day and the pay was kept in arrear in\norder that if they came late to work, or if they came irregularly, it\nmay be kept back or cut down to what the employer choose to give?\nUnder such conditions ANY man of ANY colour would prefer to work for\nhimself if he had a garden, or would be idle if he had none.\"\n\nTake, again, the following extract regarding the heroism of the\nemigrants to the Canal:--\n\n\"I walked forward\" (on the steamer bound to Jamaica), \"after we had\ndone talking.  We had five hundred of the poor creatures on their way\nto the Darien pandemonium.  The vessel was rolling with a heavy beam\nsea.  I found the whole mass of them reduced to the condition of the\npigs who used to occupy the fore decks on the Cork and Bristol packets.\nThey were [205] lying in a confused heap together, helpless, miserable,\nwithout consciousness, apparently, save a sense in each that he was\nwretched.  Unfortunate brothers-in-law! following the laws of political\neconomy, and carrying their labour to the dearest market, where, before\na year was out, half of them were to die.  They had souls, too, some of\nthem, and honest and kindly hearts.\"\n\nIt surely is refreshing to read the revelation of his first learning of\nthe possession of a soul by a fellow-human being, thus artlessly\ndescribed by one who is said to be an ex-parson.  But piquancy is Mr.\nFroude's strong point, whatever else he may be found wanting in.\n\nStill, apart from Mr. Froude's direct testimony to the fact that from\nyear to year, during a long series of years, there has been a\ncontinuous, scarcely ever interrupted emigration of Negroes to the\nSpanish mainland, in search of work for a sufficing livelihood for\nthemselves and their families--and that in the teeth of physical\ndanger, pestilence, and death--there would be enough indirect\nexoneration of the Black Man from that indictment in the wail of Mr.\nFroude and his friends regarding the alarming absorption of the lands\nof Grenada [206] and Trinidad by sable proprietors.  Land cannot be\nbought without money, nor can money be possessed except through labour,\nand the fact that so many tens of thousand Blacks are now the happy\nowners of the soil whereon, in the days so bitterly regretted by our\nauthor, their forefathers' tears, nay, very hearts' blood, had been\ncaused to flow, ought to silence for ever an accusation, which, were it\neven true, would be futile, and, being false, is worse than\ndisgraceful, coming from the lips of the Eumolpids who would fain\nimpose a not-to-be-questioned yoke on us poor helots of Ethiopia.  It\nis said that lying is the vice of slaves; but the ethics of West Indian\nwould-be mastership assert, on its behalf, that they alone should enjoy\nthe privilege of resorting to misrepresentation to give colour, if not\nsolidity, to their pretensions.\n\n\n\nBOOK III: RELIGION FOR NEGROES\n\n[207] Mr. Froude's passing on from matters secular to matters spiritual\nand sacred was a transition to be expected in the course of the grave\nand complicated discussion which he had volunteered to initiate.  It\nwas, therefore, not without curiosity that his views in the direction\nabove indicated were sought for and earnestly scrutinized by us.  But\nworse than in his treatment of purely mundane subjects, his attitude\nhere is marked by a nonchalant levity which excites our wonder that\neven he should have touched upon the spiritual side of his thesis at\nall.  The idea of the dove sent forth from the ark fluttering over the\nheaving swells of the deluge, in vain endeavour to secure a rest for\nthe soles of its feet, represents not inaptly the unfortunate\npredicament of his spirit with regard to a solid [208] faith on which\nto repose amid the surges of doubt by which it is so evidently beset.\nYet although this is his obvious plight with regard to a satisfying\nbelief, he nevertheless undertakes, with characteristic confidence, to\nsuggest a creed for the moralization of West Indian Negroes.  His\nlanguage is:--\n\n\"A religion, at any rate, which will keep the West Indian blacks from\nfalling back into devil-worship is still to seek.  In spite of the\npriests, child-murder and cannibalism have re-appeared in Hayti, but\nwithout them things might have been much worse than they are, and the\npreservation of white authority and influence in any form at all may be\nbetter than none.\"\n\nWe discern in the foregoing citation the exercise of a charity that is\nunquestionably born of fetish-worship, which, whether it be obeah\ngenerally, or restricted to a mere human skin, can be so powerful an\nagent in the formation and retention of beliefs.  Hence we see that our\nphilosopher relies here, in the domain of morals and spiritual ethics,\non a white skin as implicitly as he does on its sovereign potency in\nsecular politics.  The curiousness of the matter lies mainly in its\napplication to natives [209] of Hayti, of all people in the world.  As\na matter of fact we have had our author declaring as follows, in climax\nto his oft-repeated predictions about West Indian Negroes degenerating\ninto the condition of their fellow-Negroes in the \"Black Republic\" (p.\n285):--\n\n\"Were it worth while, one  might draw a picture of an English governor,\nwith a black parliament and a black ministry, recommending, by advice\nof his constitutional ministers, some measure like the Haytian Land\nLaw.\"\n\nNow, as the West Indies degenerating into so many white-folk-detesting\nHaytis, under our prophet's dreaded supremacy of the Blacks, is the\nburden of his book; and as the Land Law in question distinctly forbids\nthe owning by any white person of even one inch of the soil of the\nRepublic, it might, but for the above explanation, have seemed\nunaccountable, in view of the implacable distrust, not to say hatred,\nwhich this stern prohibition so clearly discloses, that our author\nshould, nevertheless, rely on the efficacy of white authority and\ninfluence over Haytians.\n\nIn continuation of his religious suggestions, he goes on to descant\nupon slavery in the [210] fashion which we have elsewhere noticed, but\nit may still be proper to add a word or two here regarding this\nparticular disquisition of his.  This we are happy in being able to do\nunder the guidance of an anterior and more reliable exponent of\necclesiastical as well as secular obedience on the part of all free and\nenlightened men in the present epoch of the world's history:--\n\n               \"Dogma and Descent, potential twin\n     Which erst could rein submissive millions in,\n     Are now spent forces on the eddying surge\n     Of Thought enfranchised.  Agencies emerge\n     Unhampered by the incubus of dread\n     Which cramped men's hearts and clogged their onward tread.\n     Dynasty, Prescription! spectral in these days\n     When Science points to Thought its surest ways,\n     And men who scorn obedience when not free\n     Demand the logic of Authority!\n     The day of manhood to the world is here,\n     And ancient homage waxes faint and drear.\n        .      .      .      .      .      .\n     Vision of rapture!  See Salvation's plan\n     'Tis serving God through ceaseless toil for man!\"\n\nThe lines above quoted are by a West Indian Negro, and explain in very\nconcise form the attitude of the educated African mind [211] with\nreference to the matters they deal with.  Mr. Froude is free to\nperceive that no special religion patched up from obsolete creeds could\nbe acceptable to those with whose sentiments the thoughts of the writer\njust quoted are in true racial unison.  It is preposterous to expect\nthat the same superstition regarding skin ascendency, which is now so\nmarkedly played out in our Colonies in temporal matters, could have any\nweight whatsoever in matters so momentous as morals and religion.  But\ngranting even the possibility of any code of worldly ethics or of\nreligion being acceptable on the dermal score so strenuously insisted\non by him, it is to be feared that, through sheer respect for the\nfitness of things, the intelligent Negro in search of guidance in faith\nand morals would fail to recognize in our author a guide, philosopher,\nand friend, to be followed without the most painful misgivings.  The\nCatholic and the Dissenting Churches which have done so much for the\ntemporal and spiritual advancement of the Negro, in spite of hindrance\nand active persecution wherever these were possible, are, so far as is\nvisible, maintaining their hold on the adhesion of those who belong to\nthem.\n\n[212] And it cannot be pretended that, among enlightened Africans as\ncompared with other enlightened people, there have been more grievous\nfailings off from the scriptural standard of deportment.  Possible it\ncertainly is that considerations akin to, or even identical with, those\nrelied upon by Mr. Froude might, on the first reception of Christianity\nin their exile, have operated effectually upon the minds of the\nchildren of Africa.  At that time the evangelizers whose converts they\nso readily became possessed the recommendation of belonging to the\ndominant caste.  Therefore, with the humility proper to their forlorn\ncondition, the poor bondsmen requited with intense gratitude such\nbeneficent interest on their behalf, as a condescension to which people\nin their hapless situation could have had no right.  But for many long\nyears, the distinction whether of temporal or of spiritual superiority\nhas ceased to be the monopoly of any particular class.  The master and\nemployer has for far more than a century and a half been often\nrepresented in the West Indies by some born African or his descendant;\nand so also has the teacher and preacher.  It is not too much to say\nthat [213] the behaviour of the liberated slaves throughout the British\nAntilles, as well as the deportment of the manumitted four million\nslaves of the Southern United States later on, bore glorious testimony\nto the humanizing effects which the religion of charity, clutched at\nand grasped in fragments, and understood with childlike incompleteness,\nhad produced within those suffering bosoms.\n\nNothing has occurred to call for a remodelling of the ordinary moral\nand spiritual machinery for the special behoof of Negroes.  Religion,\nas understood by the best of men, is purely a matter of feeling and\naction between man and man--the doing unto others as we would they\nshould do unto us; and any creed or any doctrine which directly or\nindirectly subverts or even weakens this basis is in itself a danger to\nthe highest welfare of mankind.  The simple conventional faith in God,\nin Jesus, and in a future state, however modified nowadays, has still a\nvitality which can restrain and ennoble its votaries, provided it be\ninculcated and received in a befitting spirit.  Our critic, in the\nplenitude of his familiarity with such matters, confidently asks:--\n\n[214] \"Who is now made wretched by the fear of hell?\"\n\nPossibly the belief in the material hell, the decadence of which he\nhere triumphantly assumes to be so general, may have considerably\ndiminished; but experience has shown that, with the advance of\nrefinement, there is a concurrent growth in the intensity of moral\nsensibility, whereby the waning terrors of a future material hell are\nmore than replaced by the agonies of a conscience self-convicted of\nwilful violation of the right.  The same simple faith has, in its\npractical results, been rich in the records of the humble whom it has\nexalted; of the poor to whom it has been better than wealth; of the\nrich whose stewardship of worldly prosperity it has sanctified; of the\ntimid whom it has rendered bold; and of the valiant whom it has raised\nto a divine heroism--in fine, of miracles of transformation that have\nimpelled to higher and nobler tendencies and uses the powers and gifts\ninherited or acquired by man in his natural state. They who possess\nthis faith, and cherish it as a priceless possession, may calmly oppose\nto the philosophic reasoning against the existence of [215] a Deity and\nthe rationalness of entreating Him in prayer, the simple and sufficient\ndeclaration, \"I believe.\" Normal-minded men, sensible of the\nlimitations of human faculties, never aspire to be wise beyond what is\nrevealed.  Whatever might exist beyond the grave is, so far as man and\nman in their mutual relations are concerned, not a subject that\ndiscussion can affect or speculation unravel.  To believers it cannot\nmatter whether the Sermon on the Mount embodies or does not embody the\nquality of ethics that the esoteric votaries of Mr. Froude's \"new\ncreed\" do accept or even can tolerate.  Under the old creed man's sense\nof duty kindled in sympathy towards his brother, urging him to achieve\nby self-sacrifice every possibility of beneficence; hence the old creed\ninsured an inward joy as well as \"the peace which passeth all\nunderstanding.\"  There can be no room for desiring left, when\nreceptiveness of blessings overflows; and it is the worthiest direction\nof human energy to secure for others that fulness of fruition.  Is not\nDuty the first, the highest item of moral consciousness; and is not\npromoting, according to our best ability, the welfare of our fellow\ncreatures, the first and [216] most urgent call of human duty?  Can the\nurgency of such responsibility ever cease but with the capacity, on our\nown or on our brother's part, to do or be done by respectively?\nContemptuously ignoring his share of this solemn\nresponsibility--solemn, whether regarded from a religious or a purely\nsecular point of view--to observe at least the negative obligation\nnever to wantonly do or even devise any harm to his fellows, or indeed\nany sentient creature, our new apostle affords, in his light-hearted\nreversal of the prescriptive methods of civilized ethics, a woful\nforetaste of the moral results of the \"new, not as yet crystallized\"\nbelief, whose trusted instruments of spiritual investigation are the\ntelescope and mental analysis, in order to satisfy the carpings of\nthose who so impress the world with their superhuman strong-mindedness.\n\nThe following is a profound reflection presenting, doubtless, quite a\nnew revelation to an unsophisticated world, which had so long submitted\nin reverential tameness to the self-evident impossibility of exploring\nthe Infinite:--\n\n\"The tendency of popular thought is against [217] the supernatural in\nany shape.  Far into space as the telescope can search, deep as\nanalysis can penetrate into mind and consciousness or the forces which\ngovern natural things, popular thought finds only uniformity and\nconnection of cause and effect; no sign anywhere of a personal will\nwhich is influenced by prayer or moral motives.\"\n\nHow much to be pitied are the gifted esoterics who, in such a quest,\nvainly point their telescopes into the star-thronged firmament, and\nplunge their reasoning powers into the abyss of consciousness and\nsuch-like mysteries!  The commonplace intellect of the author of \"Night\nThoughts\" was, if we may so speak, awed into an adoring rapture which\nforced from him the exclamation (may believers hail it as a dogma!)--\n\n\"An undevout astronomer is mad!\"\n\nMost probably it was in weak submission to some such sentiment as this\nthat Isaac Newton nowhere in his writings suggests even the ghost of a\ndoubt of there being a Great Architect of the Universe as the outcome\nof his telescopic explorations into the illimitable heavens.\n\n[218] It is quite possible, too, that he was, \"on insufficient\ngrounds,\" perhaps, perfectly satisfied, as a host of other intellectual\nmediocrities like himself have been, and even up to now rather\nprovokingly continue to be, with the very \"uniformity and connection of\ncause and effect\" as visible evidence of there being not only \"a\npersonal will,\" but a creative and controlling Power as well.  In this\nconnection comes to mind a certain old Book which, whatever damage\nSemitic Scholarship and Modern Criticism may succeed in inflicting on\nits contents, will always retain for the spiritual guidance of the\nworld enough and to spare of divine suggestions. With the prescience\nwhich has been the heritage of the inspired in all ages, one of the\nwriters in that Book, whom we shall now quote, foresaw, no doubt, the\ndeplorable industry of Mr. Froude and his prot\u00c3\u00a9g\u00c3\u00a9 \"popular thought,\"\nwhose mouth-piece he has so characteristically constituted himself, and\nasks in a tone wherein solemn warning blends with inquiry: \"Canst thou\nby searching find out God; canst thou find out the Almighty unto\nperfection!\"  The rational among the most loftily endowed of mankind\nhave grasped [219] the sublime significance of this query, acquiescing\nreverently in its scarcely veiled intimation of man's impotence in\npresence of the task to which it refers.\n\nBut though Mr. Froude's spiritual plight be such as we have just\nallowed him to state it, with regard to an object of faith and a motive\nof worship, yet let us hear him, in his anxiety to furbish up a special\nNegro creed, setting forth the motive for being in a hurry to\nanticipate the \"crystallization\" of his new belief:--\n\n\"The new creed, however, not having crystallized as yet into a shape\nwhich can be openly professed, and as without any creed at all the\nflesh and the devil might become too powerful, we maintain the old\nnames, as we maintain the monarchy.\"\n\nThe allusion to the monarchy seems not a very obvious one, as it\nparallels the definitive rejection of a spiritual creed with the\ntheoretical change of ancient notions regarding a concrete fact.  At\nany rate we have it that his special religion, when concocted and\ndisseminated, will have the effect of preventing the flesh and the\ndevil from having too much power over Negroes.  The objection to the\n[220] devil's sway seems to us to come with queer grace from one who\nowes his celebrity chiefly to the production of works teeming with that\npeculiar usage of language of which the Enemy of Souls is credited with\nthe special fatherhood.\n\nNo, sir, in the name of the Being regarding whose existence you and\nyour alleged \"popular thought\" are so painfully in doubt, we protest\nagainst your right, or that of any other created worm, to formulate for\nthe special behoof of Negroes any sort of artificial creed unbelieved\nin by yourself, having the function and effect of detective\n\"shadowings\" of their souls.  Away with your criminal suggestion of\ntoleration of the hideous orgies of heathenism in Hayti for the benefit\nof our future morals in the West Indies, when the political supremacy\nwhich you predict and dread and deprecate shall have become an\naccomplished fact.  Were any special standard of spiritual excellence\nrequired, our race has, in Josiah Henson and Sojourner Truth, sufficing\nmodels for our men and our women respectively.  Their ideal of\nChristian life, which we take to be the true one, is not to be judged\nof with direct reference to the Deity whom we cannot [221] see,\ninterrogate, or comprehend, but to its practical bearing in and on man,\nwhom we can see and have cognizance of, not only with our physical\nsenses, but by the intimations of the divinity which abides within us.*\nWe can see, feel, and appreciate the virtue of a fellow-mortal who\nconsecrates himself to the Divine idea through untiring exertion for\nthe bettering of the condition of the world around him, whose agony he\nmakes it his duty, only to satisfy his burning desire, to mitigate.\nThe fact in its ghastly reality lies before us that the majority of\nmankind labour and are being crushed under the tremendous trinity of\nIgnorance, Vice, and Poverty.\n\nIt is mainly in the succouring of those who thus suffer that the\nvitality of the old creed is manifested in the person of its\nprofessors.  Under this aspect we behold it moulding men, of all\nnations, countries, and tongues, whose virtues have challenged and\nshould command on its behalf the unquestioning faith and adhesion of\nevery rational observer.  \"Evidences of Christianity,\" \"Controversies,\"\n\"Exegetical Commentaries,\" have all proved [222] more or less\nfutile--as perhaps they ought--with the Science and Modern Criticism\nwhich perverts religion into a matter of dialectics. But there is a\nhope for mankind in the fact that Science itself shall have ultimately\nto admit the limitations of human inquiry into the details of the\nInfinite.  Meanwhile it requires no technical proficiency to recognize\nthe criminality of those who waste their brief threescore and ten years\nin abstract speculations, while the tangible, visible, and hideous\nsoul-destroying trinity of Vice, Ignorance, and Poverty, above\nmentioned, are desolating the world in their very sight.  There are\npossessors of personal virtue, enlightenment, and wealth, who dare\nstand neutral with regard to these dire exigencies among their fellows.\nAnd yet they are the logical helpers, as holders of the special\nantidote to each of those banes!  Infinitely more deserving of\nexecration are such folk than the callous owner of some specific, who\nallows a suffering neighbour to perish for want of it.\n\nWe who believe in the ultimate development of the Christian notion of\nduty towards God, as manifested in untiring beneficence to man, cling\nto this faith--starting from the [223] beginning of the New Testament\ndispensation--because Saul of Tarsus, transformed into Paul the Apostle\nthrough his whole-souled acceptance of this very creed with its\npractical responsibilities, has, in his ardent, indefatigable labours\nfor the enlightenment and elevation of his fellows, left us a lesson\nwhich is an enduring inspiration; because Augustine, Bishop of Hippo,\nbenefited, in a manner which has borne, and ever will bear, priceless\nfruit, enormous sections of the human family, after his definite\nsubmission to the benign yoke of the same old creed; because Vincent de\nPaul has, through the identical inspiration, endowed the world with his\neverlasting legacy of organized beneficence; because it impelled\nFrancis Xavier with yearning heart and eager footsteps through\nthousands of miles of peril, to proclaim to the darkling millions of\nIndia what he had experienced to be tidings of great joy to himself;\nbecause Matthew Hale, a lawyer, and of first prominence in a pursuit\nwhich materializes the mind and nips its native candour and tenderness,\nescaped unblighted, through the saving influence of his faith,\napproving himself in the sight of all [224] an ideal judge, even\naccording to the highest conception; because John Howard, opulent and\nfree to enjoy his opulence and repose, was drawn thereby throughout the\nwhole continent of Europe in quest of the hidden miseries that torture\nthose whom the law has shut out, in dungeons, from the light and\nsympathy of the world; because Thomas Clarkson, animated by the spirit\nof its teachings, consecrated wealth, luxury, and the quiet of an\nentire lifetime on the altar of voluntary sacrifice for the salvation\nof an alien people; because Samuel Johnson, shut out from mirthfulness\nby disease and suffering, and endowed with an intellectual pride\nintolerant of froward ignorance, was, through the chastening power of\nthat belief, transformed into the cheerful minister and willing slave\nof the weaklings whom he gathered into his home, and around whom the\ntendrils of his heart had entwined themselves, waxing closer and\nstronger in the moisture of his never-failing charity; because Henry\nHavelock, a man of the sword, whose duties have never been too\npropitious to the cultivation and fostering of the gentler virtues,\nlived and died a blameless hero, constrained by that faith to be one of\nits most illustrious exemplars; [225] because David Livingstone looms\ngreat and reverend in our mental sight in his devotion to a land and\nrace embraced in his boundless fellow-feeling, and whose miseries he\nhas commended to the sympathy of the civilized world in words the\npathos whereof has melted thousands of once obdurate hearts to crave a\nshare in applying a balm to the \"open sore of Africa\"--that slave-trade\nwhose numberless horrors beggar description; and finally--one more\nexample out of the countless varieties of types that blend into a\nunique solidarity in the active manifestation of the Christian life--we\nbelieve because Charles Gordon, the martyr-soldier of Khartoum, in\ntrusting faith a very child, but in heroism more notable than any mere\nman of whom history contains a record, gathered around himself, through\nthe sublime attractiveness of his faith-directed life, the united\nsuffrages of all nations, and now enjoys, as the recompense and seal of\nhis life's labours, an apotheosis in homage to which the heathen of\nAfrica, the man-hunting Arab, the Egyptian, the Turk, all jostle each\nother to blend with the exulting children of Britain who are directly\nglorified by his life and history.\n\n[226] Here, then, are speaking evidences of the believers' grounds.\nVerily they are of the kind that are to be seen in our midst, touched,\nheard, listened to, respected, beloved--nay, honoured, too, with the\nglad worship our inward spirit springs forth to render to goodness so\nlargely plenished from the Source of all Good.  Can Modern Science and\nCriticism explain them away, or persuade us of their insufficiency as\nincentives to the hearty acceptance of the religion that has received\nsuch glorious, yet simply logical, incarnation in the persons of weak,\nerring men who welcomed its responsibilities conjointly with its\nteachings, and thereby raised themselves to the spiritual level\npictured to ourselves in our conception of angels who have been given\nthe Divine charge concerning mankind.  Religion for Negroes, indeed!\nWhite priests, forsooth! This sort of arrogance might, possibly, avail\nin quarters where the person and pretensions of Mr. Froude could be\nimpressive and influential--but here, in the momentous concern of man\nwith Him who \"is no respecter of persons,\" his interference, mentally\ndisposed as he tells us he is with reference to such a matter, is\nnothing less than profane intrusion.\n\n[227] We will conclude by stating in a few words our notion of the only\nagency by which, not Blacks alone, but every race of mankind, might be\nuplifted to the moral level which the thousands of examples, of which\nwe have glanced at but a few, prove so indubitably the capacity of man\nto attain--each to a degree limited by the scope of his individual\npowers.  The priesthood whereof the world stands in such dire need is\nnot at all the confederacy of augurs which Mr. Froude, perhaps in\nrecollection of his former profession, so glibly suggests, with an\nesoteric creed of their own, \"crystallized into shape\" for profession\nbefore the public.  The day of priestcraft being now numbered with the\nthings that were, the exploitation of those outside of the sacerdotal\ncircle is no longer possible. Therefore the religion of mere talk,\nhowever metaphysical and profound; the religion of scenic display,\nexcept such display be symbolic of living and active verities, has lost\nwhatever of efficacy it may once have possessed, through the very\nspirit and tendency of To-day.  The reason why those few whom we have\nmentioned, and the thousands who cannot possibly be recalled, have, as\n[228] typical Christians, impressed themselves on the moral sense and\nsympathy of the ages, is simply that they lived the faith which they\nprofessed. Whatever words they may have employed to express their\nserious thoughts were never otherwise than, incidentally, a spoken\nfragment of their own interior biography. In fine, success must\ninfallibly attend this special priesthood (whether episcopally\n\"ordained\" or not) of all races, all colours, all tongues whatsoever,\nsince their lives reflect their teachings and their teachings reflect\ntheir lives.  Then, truly, they, \"the righteous, shall inherit the\nearth,\" leading mankind along the highest and noblest paths of temporal\nexistence.  Then, of course, the obeah, the cannibalism, the\ndevil-worship of the whole world, including that of Hayti, which Mr.\nFroude predicts will be adopted by us Blacks in the West Indies, shall\nno more encumber and scandalize the earth.\n\nBut Mr. Froude should, at the same time, be reminded that cannibalism\nand the hideous concomitants which he mentions are, after all,\nrelatively minor and restricted dangers to man's civilization and moral\nsoundness.  They can [229] neither operate freely nor expand easily.\nThe paralysis of horrified popular sentiment obstructs their\npropagation, and the blight of the death-penalty which hangs over the\nheads of their votaries is an additional guarantee of their being kept\nwithin bounds that minimize their perniciousness. But there are more\nfatal and further-reaching dangers to public morality and happiness of\nwhich the regenerated current opinion of the future will take prompt\nand remedial cognizance. Foremost among these will be the circulation\nof malevolent writings whereby the equilibrium of sympathy between good\nmen of different races is sought to be destroyed, through misleading\nappeals to the weaknesses and prejudices of readers; writings in which\nthe violation of actual truth cannot, save by stark stupidity, be\nattributed to innocent error; writings that scoff at humanitarian\nfeeling and belittle the importance of achievements resulting\ntherefrom; writings which strike at the root of national manliness, by\neulogizing brute force directed against weaker folk as a fit and\nlegitimate mode of securing the wishes of a mighty and enlightened\npeople; writings, in fine, which ignore the divine principle [230] in\nman, and implicitly deny the possibility of a Divine Power existing\noutside of and above man, thus materializing the mind, and tending to\nrender the earth a worse hell than it ever could have been with faith\nin the supremacy of a beneficent Power.\n\nNOTES\n\n221. *\"Est deus in nobis, agitante calescimus illo.\"--Ovid.\n\n\n\nBOOK IV: HISTORICAL SUMMARY\n\n[233] Thus far we have dealt with the main questions raised by Mr.\nFroude on the lines of his own choosing; lines which demonstrate to the\nfullest how unsuited his capacity is for appreciating--still less\ngrappling with--the political and social issues he has so confidently\nundertaken to determine.  In vain have we sought throughout his bastard\nphilosophizing for any phrase giving promise of an adequate treatment\nof this important subject.  We find paraded ostentatiously enough the\ndoctrine that in the adjustment of human affairs the possession of a\nwhite skin should be the strongest recommendation. Wonder might fairly\nbe felt that there is no suggestion of a corresponding advantage being\naccorded to the possession of a long nose or of auburn hair.  Indeed,\nlittle [234] or no attention that can be deemed serious is given to the\ninterest of the Blacks, as a large and (out of Africa) no longer\ndespicable section of the human family, in the great world-problems\nwhich are so visibly preparing and press for definitive solutions.  The\nintra-African Negro is clearly powerless to struggle successfully\nagainst personal enslavement, annexation, or volunteer forcible\n\"protection\" of his territory.  What, we ask, will in the coming ages\nbe the opinion and attitude of the extra-African millions--ten millions\nin the Western Hemisphere--dispersed so widely over the surface of the\nglobe, apt apprentices in every conceivable department of civilized\nculture? Will these men remain for ever too poor, too isolated from one\nanother for grand racial combinations?  Or will the naturally opulent\ncradle of their people, too long a prey to violence and unholy greed,\nbecome at length the sacred watchword of a generation willing and able\nto conquer or perish under its inspiration?  Such large and interesting\nquestions it was within the province and duty of a famous historian,\nlaying confident claim to prophetic insight, not to propound alone, but\nalso definitely to solve.  The sacred power [235] of forecast, however,\nhas been confined to finical pronouncements regarding those for whose\nspecial benefit he has exercised it, and to childish insults of the\nBlacks whose doom must be sealed to secure the precious result which is\naimed at.  In view of this ill-intentioned omission, we shall offer a\nfew cursory remarks bearing on, but not attempting to answer, those\ngrave inquiries concerning the African people.  As in our humble\nopinion these are questions paramount to all the petty local issues\nfinically dilated on by the confident prophet of \"The Bow of Ulysses,\"\nwe will here briefly devote ourselves to its discussion.\n\nAccepting the theory of human development propounded by our author, let\nus apply it to the African race.  Except, of course, to intelligences\nhaving a share in the Councils of Eternity, there can be no attainable\nknowledge respecting the laws which regulate the growth and progress of\ncivilization among the races of the earth. That in the existence of the\nhuman family every age has been marked by its own essential\ncharacteristics with regard to manifestations of intellectual life,\nhowever circumscribed, is a proposition too self-evident [236] to\nrequire more than the stating.  But investigation beyond such evidence\nas we possess concerning the past--whether recorded by man himself in\nthe written pages of history, or by the Creator on the tablets of\nnature--would be worse than futile.  We see that in the past different\nraces have successively come to the front, as prominent actors on the\nworld's stage.  The years of civilized development have dawned in turn\non many sections of the human family, and the Anglo-Saxons, who now\nenjoy preeminence, got their turn only after Egypt, Assyria, Babylon,\nGreece, Rome, and others had successively held the palm of supremacy.\nAnd since these mighty empires have all passed away, may we not then,\nif the past teaches aught, confidently expect that other racial\nhegemonies will arise in the future to keep up the ceaseless\nprogression of temporal existence towards the existence that is\neternal?  What is it in the nature of things that will oust the African\nrace from the right to participate, in times to come, in the high\ndestinies that have been assigned in times past to so many races that\nhave not been in anywise superior to us in the qualifications,\nphysical, moral, and intellectual, [237] that mark out a race for\nprominence amongst other races?\n\nThe normal composition of the typical Negro has the testimony of ages\nto its essential soundness and nobility.  Physically, as an active\nlabourer, he is capable of the most protracted exertion under climatic\nconditions the most exhausting.  By the mere strain of his brawn and\nsinew he has converted waste tracts of earth into fertile regions of\nagricultural bountifulness.  On the scenes of strife he has in his\nsavage state been known to be indomitable save by the stress of\nirresistible forces, whether of men or of circumstances. Staunch in his\nfriendship and tender towards the weak directly under his protection,\nthe unvitiated African furnishes in himself the combination of native\nvirtue which in the land of his exile was so prolific of good results\nfor the welfare of the whole slave-class. But distracted at home by the\nsudden irruptions of skulking foes, he has been robbed, both\nintellectually and morally, of the immense advantage of Peace, which is\nthe mother of Progress.  Transplanted to alien climes, and through\ncenturies of desolating trials, this irrepressible race has [238] bated\nnot one throb of its energy, nor one jot of its heart or hope.  In\nmodern times, after his expatriation into dismal bondage, both Britain\nand America have had occasion to see that even in the paralysing\nfetters of political and social degradation the right arm of the Ethiop\ncan be a valuable auxiliary on the field of battle.  Britain, in her\nconflict with France for supremacy in the West Indies, did not disdain\nthe aid of the sable arms that struck together with those of Britons\nfor the trophies that furnished the motives for those epic contests.\n\nLater on, the unparalleled struggle between the Northern and Southern\nStates of the American Union put to the test the indestructible fibres\nof the Negro's nature, moral as well as physical.  The Northern States,\nafter months of hesitating repugnance, and when taught at last by dire\ndefeats that colour did not in any way help to victory, at length\nsullenly acquiesced in the comradeship, hitherto disdained, of the\neager African contingent.  The records of Port Hudson, Vicksburg,\nMorris Island, and elsewhere, stand forth in imperishable attestation\nof the fact that the distinction of being laurelled during life as\nvictor, or filling [239] in death a hero's grave, is reserved for no\ncolour, but for the heart that can dare and the hand that can strike\nboldly in a righteous cause.  The experience of the Southern\nslave-holders, on the other hand, was no less striking and worthy of\nadmiration.  Every man of the twelve seceding States forming the\nSouthern Confederacy, then fighting desperately for the avowed purpose\nof perpetuating slavery, was called into the field, as no available\nmale arm could be spared from the conflict on their side.  Plantation\nowner, overseer, and every one in authority, had to be drafted away\nfrom the scene of their usual occupation to the stage whereon the\nbloody drama of internecine strife was being enacted.  Not only the\nplantation, but the home and the household, including the mistress and\nher children, had to be left, not unprotected, it is glorious to\nobserve, but, with confident assurance in their loyalty and good faith,\nunder the protection of the four million of bondsmen, who, through the\nlaws and customs of these very States, had been doomed to lifelong\nignorance and exclusion from all moralizing influences.  With what\nresult?  The protraction of the conflict on the part of the South would\n[240] have been impossible but for the admirable management and\nrealization of their resources by those benighted slaves.  On the other\nhand, not one of the thousands of Northern prisoners escaping from the\ndurance of a Southern captivity ever appealed in vain for the\nassistance and protection of a Negro.  Clearly the head and heart of\nthose bondsmen were each in its proper place.  The moral effect of\nthese experiences of the Negroes' sterling qualities was not lost on\neither North or South.  In the North it effaced from thousands of\nrepugnant hearts the adverse feelings which had devised and\naccomplished so much to the Negro's detriment.  In the South--but for\nthe blunders of the Reconstructionists--it would have considerably\nfacilitated the final readjustment of affairs between the erewhile\nmaster and slave in their new-born relations of employer and employed.\n\nReverting to the Africans who were conveyed to places other than the\nStates, it will be seen that circumstances amongst them and in their\nfavour came into play, modifying and lightening their unhappy\ncondition.  First, attention must be paid to the patriotic solidarity\nexisting [241] amongst the bondsmen, a solidarity which, in the case of\nthose who had been deported in the same ship, had all the sanctity of\nblood-relationship.  Those who had thus travelled to the \"white man's\ncountry\" addressed and considered each other as brothers and sisters.\nHence their descendants for many generations upheld, as if\nconsanguineous, the modes of address and treatment which became\nhereditary in families whose originals had travelled in the same ship.\nThese adopted uncles, aunts, nephews, nieces, were so united by common\nsympathies, that good or ill befalling any one of them intensely\naffected the whole connection.  Mutual support commensurate with the\narea of their location thus became the order among these people.  At\nthe time of the first deportation of Africans to the West Indies to\nreplace the aborigines who had been decimated in the mines at Santo\nDomingo and in the pearl fisheries of the South Caribbean, the\ncircumstances of the Spanish settlers in the Antilles were of singular,\neven romantic, interest.\n\nThe enthusiasm which overflowed from the crusades and the Moorish wars,\nupon the discovery and conquest of America, had occasioned [242]  the\npeopling of the Western Archipelago by a race of men in whom the daring\nof freebooters was strangely blended with a fierce sort of\nreligiousness.  As holders of slaves, these men recognized, and\nendeavoured to their best to give effect to, the humane injunctions of\nBishop Las Casas.  The Negroes, therefore, male and female, were\npromptly presented for admission by baptism into the Catholic Church,\nwhich always had stood open and ready to welcome them.  The relations\nof god-father and god-mother resulting from these baptismal functions\nhad a most important bearing on the reciprocal stations of master and\nslave.  The god-children were, according to ecclesiastical custom,\nconsidered in every sense entitled to all the protection and assistance\nwhich were within the competence of the god-parents, who, in their\nturn, received from the former the most absolute submission.  It is\neasy to see that the planters, as well as those intimately connected\nwith them, in assuming such obligations with their concomitant\nresponsibilities, practically entered into bonds which they all\nregarded as, if possible, more solemn than the natural ties of secular\nparentage. The duty [243] of providing for these dependents usually\ntook the shape of their being apprenticed to, and trained in the\nvarious arts and vocations that constitute the life of civilization.\nIn many cases, at the death of their patrons, the bondsmen who were\ndeemed most worthy were, according to the means of the testator,\nprovided for in a manner lifting them above the necessity of future\ndependence.  Manumission, too, either by favour or through purchase,\nwas allowed the fullest operation.  Here then was the active influence\nof higher motives than mere greed of gain or the pride of racial power\nmellowing the lot and gilding the future prospects of the dwellers in\nthe tropical house of bondage.\n\nThe next, and even more effectual agency in modifying and harmonizing\nthe relations between owner and bondspeople was the inevitable\nattraction of one race to the other by the sentiment of natural\naffection.  Out of this sprang living ties far more intimate and\nbinding on the moral sense than even obligations contracted in\ndeference to the Church.  Natural impulses have often diviner sources\nthan ecclesiastical mandates.  Obedience to the former not seldom\nbrings down the penalties of the Church; but [244] the culprit finds\nsolace in the consciousness that the offence might in itself be a\nprotection from the thunders it has provoked.  Under these\ncircumstances the general body of planters, who were in the main\nadventurers of the freest type, were fain to establish connections with\nsuch of the slave-women as attracted their sympathy, through personal\ncomeliness or aptitude in domestic affairs, or, usually, both combined.\nThere was ordinarily in this beginning of the seventeenth century no\nVashti that needed expulsion from the abode of a plantation Ahasuerus\nto make room for the African Esther to be admitted to the chief place\nwithin the portals.  One great natural consequence of this was the\nextension to the relatives or guardians of the bondswoman so preferred\nof an amount of favour which, in the case of the more capable males,\ncompletes the parallel we have been drawing by securing for each of\nthem the precedence and responsibilities of a Mordecai.  The offspring\nof these natural alliances came in therefore to cement more intimately\nthe union of interests which previous relations had generated.  Beloved\nby their fathers, and in many cases destined by them to a lot superior\n[245] to that whereto they were entitled by formal law and social\nprescription, these young procreations--Mulattos, as they were\ncalled--were made the objects of special and careful provisions on the\nfathers' part.  They were, according to the means of their fathers in\nthe majority of cases, sent for education and training to European or\nother superior institutions.  After this course they were either\nformally acknowledged by their fathers, or, if that was impracticable,\namply and suitably provided for in a career out of their native colony.\nTo a reflecting mind there is something that interests, not to say\nfascinates, in studying the action and reaction upon one another of\ncircumstances in the existence of the Mulatto. As a matter of fact, he\nhad much more to complain of under the slave system than his\npure-blooded African relations.  The law, by decreeing that every child\nof a freeman and a slave woman must follow the fortune of the womb,\nthus making him the property of his mother exclusively, practically\nrobbed him before his very birth of the nurture and protection of a\nfather.  His reputed father had no obligation to be even aware of his\nprocreation, and nevertheless [246] --so inscrutable are the ways of\nProvidence!--the Mulatto was the centre around which clustered the\noutraged instincts of nature in rebellion against the desecrating\nmandates that prescribed treason to herself.  Law and society may\ndecree; but in our normal humanity there throbs a sentiment which\nneutralizes every external impulse contrary to its promptings.\n\nIn meditating on the varied history of the Negro in the United States,\nsince his first landing on the banks of the James River in 1619 till\nthe Emancipation Act of President Lincoln in 1865, it is curious to\nobserve that the elevation of the race, though in a great measure\nsecured, proceeded from circumstances almost the reverse of those that\noperated so favourably in the same direction elsewhere. The men of the\nslave-holding States, chiefly Puritans or influenced by Puritanic\nsurroundings, were not under the ecclesiastical sway which rendered\npossible in the West Indies and other Catholic countries the\nestablishment of the reciprocal bonds of god-parents and god-children.\nThe self-same causes operated to prevent any large blending of the two\nraces, inasmuch as the immigrant from Britain who [247] had gone forth\nfrom his country to better his fortune had not left behind him his\nattachment to the institutions of the mother-land, among which\nmarrying, whenever practicable, was one of the most cherished.  Above\nall, too, as another powerful check at first to such alliances between\nthe ruling and servile races of the States, there existed the native\nidiosyncracy of the Anglo-Saxon.  That class of them who had left\nBritain were likelier than the more refined of their nation to exhibit\nin its crudest and cruellest form the innate jealousy and contempt of\nother races that pervades the Anglo-Saxon bosom.  It is but a simple\nfact that, whenever he condescended thereto, familiarity with even the\nloveliest of the subject people was regarded as a mighty self-unbending\nfor which the object should be correspondingly grateful.  So there\ncould, in the beginning, be no frequent instances of the romantic\nchivalry that gilded the quasi-marital relations of the more fervid and\nhumane members of the Latin stock.\n\nBut this kind of intercourse, which in the earlier generation was\nundoubtedly restricted in North America by the checks above adverted\nto, and, presumably, also by the mutual unintelligibility [248] in\nspeech, gradually expanded with the natural increase of the slave\npopulation.  The American-born, English-speaking Negro girl, who had in\nmany cases been the playmate of her owner, was naturally more\nintelligible, more accessible, more attractive--and the inevitable\nconsequence was the extension apace of that intercourse, the offspring\nwhereof became at length so visibly numerous.\n\nAmong the Romans, the grandest of all colonizers, the individual's\nCivis Romanus sum--I am a Roman citizen--was something more than verbal\nvapouring; it was a protective talisman--a buckler no less than a\nsword.  Yet was the possession of this noble and singular privilege no\nbarrier to Roman citizens meeting on a broad humanitarian level any\nalien race, either allied to or under the protection of that\nworld-famous commonwealth.  In the speeches of the foremost orators and\nstatesmen among the conquerors of the then known world, the allusions\nto subject or allied aliens are distinguished by a decorous observance\nof the proprieties which should mark any reference to those who had the\ndignity of Rome's [249] friendship, or the privilege of her august\nprotection.  Observations, therefore, regarding individuals of rank in\nthese alien countries had the same sobriety and deference which marked\nallusions to born Romans of analogous degree.  Such magnanimity, we\ngrieve to say, is not characteristic of the race which now replaces the\nRomans in the colonizing leadership of the world.  We read with\nfeelings akin to despair of the cheap, not to say derogatory, manner in\nwhich, in both Houses of Parliament, native potentates, especially of\nnon-European countries, are frequently spoken of by the hereditary\naristocracy and the first gentlemen of the British Empire.  The inborn\nracial contempt thus manifested in quarters where rigid self-control\nand decorum should form the very essence of normal deportment, was not\nlikely, as we have before hinted, to find any mollifying ingredient in\nthe settlers on the banks of the Mississippi.  Therefore should we not\nbe surprised to find, with regard to many an illicit issue of \"down\nSouth,\" the arrogance of race so overmastering the promptings of nature\nas to render not unfrequent at the auction-block the sight of many a\nchattel of mixed blood, the offspring [250] of some planter whom\nbusiness exigency had forced to this commercial transaction as the\nreadiest mode of self-release.  Yet were the exceptions to this rule\nenough to contribute appreciably to the weight and influence of the\nmixed race in the North, where education and a fair standing had been\nclandestinely secured for their children by parents to whom law and\nsociety had made it impossible to do more, and whom conscience rendered\nincapable of stopping at less.\n\nFrom this comparative sketch of the history of the slaves in the\nStates, in the West Indies and countries adjacent, it will be perceived\nthat in the latter scenes of bondage everything had conspired to render\na fusion of interests between the ruling and the servile classes not\nonly easy, but inevitable.  In the very first generation after their\nintroduction, the Africans began to press upward, a movement which\nevery decade has accelerated, in spite of the changes which supervened\nas each of the Colonies fell under British sway.  Nearly two centuries\nhad by this time elapsed, and the coloured influence, which had grown\nwith their wealth, education, numbers, and unity, though [251]\ncircumscribed by the emancipation of the slaves, and the consequent\ndepression in fortune of all slave-owners, never was or could be\nannihilated.  In the Government service there were many for whom the\npatronage of god-parents or the sheer influence of their family had\neffected an entrance.  The prevalence and potency of the influences we\nhave been dilating upon may be gauged by the fact that personages no\nless exalted than Governors of various Colonies--of Trinidad in three\nauthentic cases--have been sharers in the prevailing usages, in the\nmatter of standing sponsors (by proxy), and also of relaxing in the\nsociety of some fascinating daughter of the sun from the tension and\nwear of official duty.  In the three cases just referred to, the most\ncareful provision was made for the suitable education and starting in\nlife of the issues.  For the god-children of Governors there were\nplaces in the public service, and so from the highest to the lowest the\nhumanitarian intercourse of the classes was confirmed.\n\nConsequent on the frequent abandonment of their plantations by many\nowners who despaired of being able to get along by paying [252] their\nway, an opening was made for the insinuation of Absenteeism into our\nagricultural, in short, our economic existence.  The powerful sugar\nlords, who had invested largely in the cane plantations, were fain to\ntake over and cultivate the properties which their debtors doggedly\nrefused to continue working, under pretext of the entire absence, or at\nany rate unreliability, of labour.  The representatives of those new\ntransatlantic estate proprietors displaced, but never could replace,\nthe original cultivators, who were mostly gentlemen as well as\nagriculturists.  It was from this overseer class that the vituperations\nand slanders went forth that soon became stereotyped, concerning the\nNegro's incorrigible laziness and want of ambition--those gentry\nadjusting the scale of wages, not according to the importance and value\nof the labour done, but according to the scornful estimate which they\nhad formed of the Negro personally.  And when the wages were fixed\nfairly, they almost invariably sought to indemnify themselves for their\nenforced justice by the insulting license of their tongues, addressed\nto males and females alike.  The influence of such men on local\nlegislation, in which they [253] had a preponderating share, either as\nactual proprietors or as the attorneys of absentees, was not in the\ndirection of refinement or liberality.  Indeed, the kind of laws which\nthey enacted, especially during the apprenticeship (1834-8), is thus\nsummarized by one, and him an English officer, who was a visitor in\nthose agitated days of the Colonies:--\n\n\"It is demonstrated that the laws which were to come into operation\nimmediately on expiration of the apprenticeship are of the most\nobjectionable character, and fully established the fact not only of a\nfuture intention to infringe the rights of the emancipated classes, but\nof the actual commencement and extensive progress of a Colonial system\nfor that purpose.  The object of the laws is to circumscribe the market\nfor free labour--to prohibit the possession or sale of ordinary\narticles of produce on sale, the obvious intention of which is to\nconfine the emancipated classes to a course of agricultural\nservitude--to give the employers a monopoly of labour, and to keep down\na free competition for wages--to create new and various modes of\napprenticeship for the purpose of prolonging predial service, together\nwith many evils of the [254] late system--to introduce unnecessary\nrestraint and coercion, the design of which is to create a perpetual\nsurveillance over the liberated negroes, and to establish a legislative\ndespotism.  The several laws passed are based upon the most vicious\nprinciples of legislation, and in their operation will be found\nintolerably oppressive and entirely subversive of the just intentions\nof the British Legislature.\"\n\nThese liberal-souled gentry were, in sooth, Mr. Froude's\n\"representatives\" of Britain, whose traditions steadily followed in\ntheir families, he has so well and sympathetically set forth.\n\nWe thus see that the irritation and rancour seething in the breast of\nthe new plantocracy, of whom the majority was of the type that then\nalso flourished in Barbados, Jamaica, and Demerara, were nourished and\nkept acute in order to crush the African element.  Harm was done,\ncertainly; but not to the ruinous extent sometimes declared.  It was\ntoo late for perfect success, as, according to the Negroes' own phrase,\npeople of colour had by that time already \"passed the lock-jaw\"* stage\n(at which trifling misadventures [255] might have nipped the germ of\ntheir progress in the bud.)  In spite of adverse legislation, and in\nspite of the scandalous subservience of certain Governors to the\nColonial Legislatures, the Race can point with thankfulness and pride\nto the visible records of their success wherever they have permanently\nsojourned.\n\nPrimary education of a more general and undiscriminating character,\nespecially as to race and colour, was secured for the bulk of the West\nIndies by voluntary undertakings, and notably through the munificent\nprovision of Lady Mico, which extended to the whole of the principal\nislands.\n\nThanks to Lord Harris for introducing, and to Sir Arthur Gordon for\nextending to the secondary stage, the public education of Trinidad,\nthere has been since Emancipation, that is, during the last\nthirty-seven years, a more effective bringing together in public\nschools of various grades, of children of all races and ranks.  Rivals\nat home, at school and college, in books as well as on the playground,\nthey have very frequently gone abroad together to learn the professions\nthey have selected.  In this way there is an intercommunion between all\nthe [256] intelligent sections of the inhabitants, based on a common\ntraining and the subtle sympathies usually generated in enlightened\nbreasts by intimate personal knowledge.  In mixed communities thus\ncircumstanced, there is no possibility of maintaining distinctions\nbased on mere colour, as advocated by Mr. Froude.\n\nThe following brief summary by the Rev. P. H. Doughlin, Rector of St.\nClement's, Trinidad, a brilliant star among the sons of Ham, embodies\nthis fact in language which, so far as it goes, is as comprehensive as\nit is weighty:--\n\n\"Who could, without seeming to insult the intelligence of men, have\npredicted on the day of Emancipation that the Negroes then released\nfrom the blight and withering influence of ten generations of cruel\nbondage, so weakened and half-destroyed--so denationalized and\ndemoralized--so despoiled and naked, would be in the position they are\nnow?  In spite of the proud, supercilious, and dictatorial bearing of\ntheir teachers, in spite of the hampering of unsympathetic, alien\noversight, in spite of the spirit of dependence and servility\nengendered by slavery, not only have individual members of the race\nentered into all the offices of dignity in [257] Church and State, as\nsubalterns--as hewers of wood and drawers of water--but they have\nattained to the very highest places.  Here in the West Indies, and on\nthe West Coast of Africa, are to be found Surgeons of the Negro Race,\nSolicitors, Barristers, Mayors, Councillors, Principals and Founders of\nHigh Schools and Colleges, Editors and Proprietors of Newspapers,\nArchdeacons, Bishops, Judges, and Authors--men who not only teach those\nimmediately around them, but also teach the world.  Members of the race\nhave even been entrusted with the administration of Governments.  And\nit is not mere commonplace men that the Negro Race has produced.  Not\nonly have the British Universities thought them worthy of their\nhonorary degrees and conferred them on them, but members of the race\nhave won these University degrees.  A few years back a full-blooded\nNegro took the highest degree Oxford has to give to a young man.  The\nEuropean world is looking with wonder and admiration at the progress\nmade by the Negro Race--a progress unparalleled in the annals of the\nhistory of any race.\"\n\nTo this we may add that in the domain [258] of high literature the\nBlacks of the United States, for the twenty-five years of social\nemancipation, and despite the lingering obstructions of caste\nprejudice, have positively achieved wonders.  Leaving aside the\nwritings of men of such high calibre as F. Douglass, Dr. Hyland Garnet,\nProf. Crummell, Prof. E. Blyden, Dr. Tanner, and others, it is\ngratifying to be able to chronicle the Ethiopic women of North America\nas moving shoulder to shoulder with the men in the highest spheres of\nliterary activity.  Among a brilliant band of these our sisters,\nconspicuous no less in poetry than in prose, we single out but a\nsolitary name for the double purpose of preserving brevity and of\ngiving in one embodiment the ideal Afro-American woman of letters. The\nallusion here can scarcely fail to point to Mrs. S. Harper.  This\nlady's philosophical subtlety of reasoning on grave questions finds\neffective expression in a prose of singular precision and vigour. But\nit is as a poet that posterity will hail her in the coming ages of our\nRace.  For pathos, depth of spiritual insight, and magical exercise of\na rare power of self-utterance, it will hardly be questioned that she\nhas surpassed every competitor [259] among females--white or\nblack--save and except Elizabeth Barett Browning, with whom the gifted\nAfrican stands on much the same plane of poetic excellence.\n\nThe above summary of our past vicissitudes and actual position shows\nthat there is nothing in our political circumstances to occasion\nuneasiness.  The miserable skin and race doctrine we have been\ndiscussing does not at all prefigure the destinies at all events of the\nWest Indies, or determine the motives that will affect them. With the\nexception of those belonging to the Southern states of the Union, the\nvast body of African descendants now dispersed in various countries of\nthe Western Hemisphere are at sufficient peace to begin occupying\nthemselves, according to some fixed programme, about matters of racial\nimportance.  More than ten millions of Africans are scattered over the\nwide area indicated, and possess amongst them instances of mental and\nother qualifications which render them remarkable among their\nfellow-men.  But like the essential parts of a complicated albeit\nperfect machine, these attainments and qualifications so widely\ndispersed await, it is evident, some potential [260] agency to collect\nand adjust them into the vast engine essential for executing the true\npurposes of the civilized African Race.  Already, especially since the\nlate Emancipation Jubilee, are signs manifest of a desire for\nintercommunion and intercomprehension amongst the more distinguished of\nour people. With intercourse and unity of purpose will be secured the\nmeans to carry out the obvious duties which are sure to devolve upon\nus, especially with reference to the cradle of our Race, which is most\nprobably destined to be the ultimate resting-place and headquarters of\nmillions of our posterity.  Within the short time that we had to\ncompass all that we have achieved, there could not have arisen\nopportunities for doing more than we have effected.  Meanwhile our\npresent device is: \"Work, Hope, and Wait!\"\n\nFinally, it must be borne in mind that the abolition of physical\nbondage did not by any means secure all the requisite conditions of \"a\nfair field and no favour\" for the future career of the freedmen. The\nremnant of Jacob, on their return from the Captivity, were compelled,\nwhilst rebuilding their Temple, literally to labour with the working\ntool in one hand [261] and the sword for personal defence in the other.\nEven so have the conditions, figuratively, presented themselves under\nwhich the Blacks have been obliged to rear the fabric of self-elevation\nsince 1838, whilst combating ceaselessly the obstacles opposed to the\nrealizing of their legitimate aspirations. Mental and, in many cases,\nmaterial success has been gained, but the machinery for accumulating\nand applying the means required for comprehensive racial enterprises is\nwaiting on Providence, time, and circumstances for its establishment\nand successful working.\n\nNOTES\n\n254. *\"Yo t\u00c3\u00a9'ja pass\u00c3\u00a9 mal macho\u00c3\u00a8\"--in metaphorical allusion to new-born\ninfants who have lived beyond a certain number of days.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of West Indian Fables by James Anthony\nFroude Explained by J.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp:\/\/pglaf.org\/fundraising.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":1401,"split":"test"}
