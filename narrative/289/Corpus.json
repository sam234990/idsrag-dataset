{"ori_id":"432cfe548f1f51045f8cba8f8f50e4e0e47a0771","title":"Honorine (novel)","context":"Honorine (novel)\n Maurice is a Consul at Genes, a Mediterranean town where he has married Onorina the daughter of the only wealthy man into the town, although it seems he was originally extremely reluctant to get married. They are having a dinner party with guests from Paris, and Maurice recounts some of his history.\nWhen Maurice was young, he became secretary to Count Octave. The count was very good to him but seemed very sad and mysterious as if hiding some past misfortune. Eventually Maurice discovers that he had been married, but his wife had left him. She, Honorine, had been brought up with him from a very early age, having been adopted by his parents, and they were devoted to each other. They had become married almost as a matter of course. However after a few months she just disappeared. Octave then discovered she had gone off with an adventurer who had abandoned her, pregnant. She had the child but lived full of remorse, and resisted all attempts of Octave to get in touch with her. Octave is still devoted to her and secretly helps her in her business of flower arranging. However she still refuses to have anything to do with him. The Count therefore gets Maurice to act as a go between, arranging for him to occupy the house next to her, and pose as a misogynistic flower breeder. Eventually Maurice makes contact and indirectly puts the Count\u00e2\u0080\u0099s case. Honorine is still too overcome with remorse and shame. Eventually however she agrees to see the count, and then goes back to live with him.\nMaurice has to leave the Count\u00e2\u0080\u0099s company because of the part he played and that is why he became consul. Two years after, he heard of the death of Honorine, and soon after was visited by the Count who had grown old before his time, and who died shortly after departing. The story is full of discussion about the meaning of relationships and Maurice acts throughout as interpreter for the two parties. There is also the implication that he had in fact fallen in love with Honorine himself, which is why he avoided marriage initially.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of Honorine, by Honore de Balzac\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

Something better than England is everywhere to be\nfound; whereas it is excessively difficult to find the charms of France\noutside France. Other countries can show admirable scenery, and they\nfrequently offer greater comfort than that of France, which makes but\nslow progress in that particular. They sometimes display a bewildering\nmagnificence, grandeur, and luxury; they lack neither grace nor noble\nmanners; but the life of the brain, the talent for conversation, the\n\"Attic salt\" so familiar at Paris, the prompt apprehension of what one\nis thinking, but does not say, the spirit of the unspoken, which is half\nthe French language, is nowhere else to be met with. Hence a Frenchman,\nwhose raillery, as it is, finds so little comprehension, would wither\nin a foreign land like an uprooted tree. Emigration is counter to the\ninstincts of the French nation. Many Frenchmen, of the kind here in\nquestion, have owned to pleasure at seeing the custom-house officers\nof their native land, which may seem the most daring hyperbole of\npatriotism.\n\nThis preamble is intended to recall to such Frenchmen as have traveled\nthe extreme pleasure they have felt on occasionally finding their native\nland, like an oasis, in the drawing-room of some diplomate: a pleasure\nhard to be understood by those who have never left the asphalt of the\nBoulevard des Italiens, and to whom the Quais of the left bank of the\nSeine are not really Paris. To find Paris again! Do you know what that\nmeans, O Parisians? It is to find--not indeed the cookery of the _Rocher\nde Cancale_ as Borel elaborates it for those who can appreciate it, for\nthat exists only in the Rue Montorgueil--but a meal which reminds you\nof it! It is to find the wines of France, which out of France are to be\nregarded as myths, and as rare as the woman of whom I write! It is\nto find--not the most fashionable pleasantry, for it loses its aroma\nbetween Paris and the frontier--but the witty understanding, the\ncritical atmosphere in which the French live, from the poet down to the\nartisan, from the duchess to the boy in the street.\n\nIn 1836, when the Sardinian Court was residing at Genoa, two Parisians,\nmore or less famous, could fancy themselves still in Paris when they\nfound themselves in a palazzo, taken by the French Consul-General, on\nthe hill forming the last fold of the Apennines between the gate of San\nTomaso and the well-known lighthouse, which is to be seen in all the\nkeepsake views of Genoa. This palazzo is one of the magnificent villas\non which Genoese nobles were wont to spend millions at the time when the\naristocratic republic was a power.\n\nIf the early night is beautiful anywhere, it surely is at Genoa, after\nit has rained as it can rain there, in torrents, all the morning; when\nthe clearness of the sea vies with that of the sky; when silence reigns\non the quay and in the groves of the villa, and over the marble heads\nwith yawning jaws, from which water mysteriously flows; when the stars\nare beaming; when the waves of the Mediterranean lap one after another\nlike the avowal of a woman, from whom you drag it word by word. It must\nbe confessed, that the moment when the perfumed air brings fragrance to\nthe lungs and to our day-dreams; when voluptuousness, made visible and\nambient as the air, holds you in your easy-chair; when, a spoon in your\nhand, you sip an ice or a sorbet, the town at your feet and fair woman\nopposite--such Boccaccio hours can be known only in Italy and on the\nshores of the Mediterranean.\n\nImagine to yourself, round the table, the Marquis di Negro, a knight\nhospitaller to all men of talent on their travels, and the Marquis\nDamaso Pareto, two Frenchmen disguised as Genoese, a Consul-General\nwith a wife as beautiful as a Madonna, and two silent children--silent\nbecause sleep has fallen on them--the French Ambassador and his wife,\na secretary to the Embassy who believes himself to be crushed and\nmischievous; finally, two Parisians, who have come to take leave of\nthe Consul's wife at a splendid dinner, and you will have the picture\npresented by the terrace of the villa about the middle of May--a picture\nin which the predominant figure was that of a celebrated woman, on\nwhom all eyes centered now and again, the heroine of this improvised\nfestival.\n\nOne of the two Frenchmen was the famous landscape painter, Leon de Lora;\nthe other a well known critic Claude Vignon. They had both come with\nthis lady, one of the glories of the fair sex, Mademoiselle des Touches,\nknown in the literary world by the name of Camille Maupin.\n\nMademoiselle des Touches had been to Florence on business. With the\ncharming kindness of which she is prodigal, she had brought with her\nLeon de Lora to show him Italy, and had gone on as far as Rome that he\nmight see the Campagna. She had come by Simplon, and was returning by\nthe Cornice road to Marseilles. She had stopped at Genoa, again on the\nlandscape painter's account. The Consul-General had, of course, wished\nto do the honors of Genoa, before the arrival of the Court, to a woman\nwhose wealth, name, and position recommend her no less than her talents.\nCamille Maupin, who knew her Genoa down to its smallest chapels, had\nleft her landscape painter to the care of the diplomate and the two\nGenoese marquises, and was miserly of her minutes. Though the ambassador\nwas a distinguished man of letters, the celebrated lady had refused to\nyield to his advances, dreading what the English call an exhibition;\nbut she had drawn in the claws of her refusals when it was proposed that\nthey should spend a farewell day at the Consul's villa. Leon de Lora had\ntold Camille that her presence at the villa was the only return he\ncould make to the Ambassador and his wife, the two Genoese noblemen, the\nConsul and his wife. So Mademoiselle des Touches had sacrificed one of\nthose days of perfect freedom, which are not always to be had in Paris\nby those on whom the world has its eye.\n\nNow, the meeting being accounted for, it is easy to understand that\netiquette had been banished, as well as a great many women even of the\nhighest rank, who were curious to know whether Camille Maupin's manly\ntalent impaired her grace as a pretty woman, and to see, in a word,\nwhether the trousers showed below her petticoats. After dinner till nine\no'clock, when a collation was served, though the conversation had been\ngay and grave by turns, and constantly enlivened by Leon de Lora's\nsallies--for he is considered the most roguish wit of Paris to-day--and\nby the good taste which will surprise no one after the list of guests,\nliterature had scarcely been mentioned. However, the butterfly flittings\nof this French tilting match were certain to come to it, were it only to\nflutter over this essentially French subject. But before coming to the\nturn in the conversation which led the Consul-General to speak, it will\nnot be out of place to give some account of him and his family.\n\nThis diplomate, a man of four-and-thirty, who had been married about six\nyears, was the living portrait of Lord Byron. The familiarity of that\nface makes a description of the Consul's unnecessary. It may, however,\nbe noted that there was no affectation in his dreamy expression. Lord\nByron was a poet, and the Consul was poetical; women know and recognize\nthe difference, which explains without justifying some of their\nattachments. His handsome face, thrown into relief by a delightful\nnature, had captivated a Genoese heiress. A Genoese heiress! the\nexpression might raise a smile at Genoa, where, in consequence of the\ninability of daughters to inherit, a woman is rarely rich; but Onorina\nPedrotti, the only child of a banker without heirs male, was an\nexception. Notwithstanding all the flattering advances prompted by a\nspontaneous passion, the Consul-General had not seemed to wish to marry.\nNevertheless, after living in the town for two years, and after certain\nsteps taken by the Ambassador during his visits to the Genoese Court,\nthe marriage was decided on. The young man withdrew his former refusal,\nless on account of the touching affection of Onorina Pedrotti than by\nreason of an unknown incident, one of those crises of private life which\nare so instantly buried under the daily tide of interests that, at a\nsubsequent date, the most natural actions seem inexplicable.\n\nThis involution of causes sometimes affects the most serious events of\nhistory. This, at any rate, was the opinion of the town of Genoa, where,\nto some women, the extreme reserve, the melancholy of the French Consul\ncould be explained only by the word passion. It may be remarked, in\npassing, that women never complain of being the victims of a preference;\nthey are very ready to immolate themselves for the common weal. Onorina\nPedrotti, who might have hated the Consul if she had been altogether\nscorned, loved her _sposo_ no less, and perhaps more, when she know that\nhe had loved. Women allow precedence in love affairs. All is well if\nother women are in question.\n\nA man is not a diplomate with impunity: the _sposo_ was as secret as the\ngrave--so secret that the merchants of Genoa chose to regard the young\nConsul's attitude as premeditated, and the heiress might perhaps have\nslipped through his fingers if he had not played his part of a love-sick\n_malade imaginaire_. If it was real, the women thought it too degrading\nto be believed.\n\nPedrotti's daughter gave him her love as a consolation; she lulled these\nunknown griefs in a cradle of tenderness and Italian caresses.\n\nIl Signor Pedrotti had indeed no reason to complain of the choice to\nwhich he was driven by his beloved child. Powerful protectors in Paris\nwatched over the young diplomate's fortunes. In accordance with a\npromise made by the Ambassador to the Consul-General's father-in-law,\nthe young man was created Baron and Commander of the Legion of Honor.\nSignor Pedrotti himself was made a Count by the King of Sardinia.\nOnorina's dower was a million of francs. As to the fortune of the Casa\nPedrotti, estimated at two millions, made in the corn trade, the young\ncouple came into it within six months of their marriage, for the first\nand last Count Pedrotti died in January 1831.\n\nOnorina Pedrotti is one of those beautiful Genoese women who, when they\nare beautiful, are the most magnificent creatures in Italy. Michael\nAngelo took his models in Genoa for the tomb of Giuliano. Hence the\nfulness and singular placing of the breast in the figures of Day and\nNight, which so many critics have thought exaggerated, but which is\npeculiar to the women of Liguria. A Genoese beauty is no longer to be\nfound excepting under the mezzaro, as at Venice it is met with only\nunder the _fazzioli_. This phenomenon is observed among all fallen\nnations. The noble type survives only among the populace, as after the\nburning of a town coins are found hidden in the ashes. And Onorina, an\nexception as regards her fortune, is no less an exceptional patrician\nbeauty. Recall to mind the figure of Night which Michael Angelo has\nplaced at the feet of the _Pensieroso_, dress her in modern garb, twist\nthat long hair round the magnificent head, a little dark in complexion,\nset a spark of fire in those dreamy eyes, throw a scarf about the\nmassive bosom, see the long dress, white, embroidered with flowers,\nimagine the statue sitting upright, with her arms folded like those of\nMademoiselle Georges, and you will see before you the Consul's wife,\nwith a boy of six, as handsome as a mother's desire, and a little\ngirl of four on her knees, as beautiful as the type of childhood so\nlaboriously sought out by the sculptor David to grace a tomb.\n\nThis beautiful family was the object of Camille's secret study. It\nstruck Mademoiselle des Touches that the Consul looked rather too\nabsent-minded for a perfectly happy man.\n\nAlthough, throughout the day, the husband and wife had offered her the\npleasing spectacle of complete happiness, Camille wondered why one of\nthe most superior men she had ever met, and whom she had seen too\nin Paris drawing-rooms, remained as Consul-General at Genoa when he\npossessed a fortune of a hundred odd thousand francs a year. But, at the\nsame time, she had discerned, by many of the little nothings which women\nperceive with the intelligence of the Arab sage in _Zadig_, that the\nhusband was faithfully devoted. These two handsome creatures would no\ndoubt love each other without a misunderstanding till the end of their\ndays. So Camille said to herself alternately, \"What is wrong?--Nothing\nis wrong,\" following the misleading symptoms of the Consul's demeanor;\nand he, it may be said, had the absolute calmness of Englishmen, of\nsavages, of Orientals, and of consummate diplomatists.\n\nIn discussing literature, they spoke of the perennial stock-in-trade\nof the republic of letters--woman's sin. And they presently found\nthemselves confronted by two opinions: When a woman sins, is the man\nor the woman to blame? The three women present--the Ambassadress,\nthe Consul's wife, and Mademoiselle des Touches, women, of course, of\nblameless reputations--were without pity for the woman. The men tried to\nconvince these fair flowers of their sex that some virtues might remain\nin a woman after she had fallen.\n\n\"How long are we going to play at hide-and-seek in this way?\" said Leon\nde Lora.\n\n\"_Cara vita_, go and put your children to bed, and send me by Gina the\nlittle black pocket-book that lies on my Boule cabinet,\" said the Consul\nto his wife.\n\nShe rose without a reply, which shows that she loved her husband very\ntruly, for she already knew French enough to understand that her husband\nwas getting rid of her.\n\n\"I will tell you a story in which I played a part, and after that we can\ndiscuss it, for it seems to me childish to practise with the scalpel on\nan imaginary body. Begin by dissecting a corpse.\"\n\nEvery one prepared to listen, with all the greater readiness because\nthey had all talked enough, and this is the moment to be chosen for\ntelling a story. This, then, is the Consul-General's tale:--\n\n\"When I was two-and-twenty, and had taken my degree in law, my old\nuncle, the Abbe Loraux, then seventy-two years old, felt it necessary\nto provide me with a protector, and to start me in some career. This\nexcellent man, if not indeed a saint, regarded each year of his life as\na fresh gift from God. I need not tell you that the father confessor of\na Royal Highness had no difficulty in finding a place for a young man\nbrought up by himself, his sister's only child. So one day, towards the\nend of the year 1824, this venerable old man, who for five years had\nbeen Cure of the White Friars at Paris, came up to the room I had in his\nhouse, and said:\n\n\"'Get yourself dressed, my dear boy; I am going to introduce you to some\none who is willing to engage you as secretary. If I am not mistaken, he\nmay fill my place in the event of God's taking me to Himself. I shall\nhave finished mass at nine o'clock; you have three-quarters of an hour\nbefore you. Be ready.'\n\n\"'What, uncle! must I say good-bye to this room, where for four years I\nhave been so happy?'\n\n\"'I have no fortune to leave you,' said he.\n\n\"'Have you not the reputation of your name to leave me, the memory of\nyour good works----?'\n\n\"'We need say nothing of that inheritance,' he replied, smiling. 'You do\nnot yet know enough of the world to be aware that a legacy of that kind\nis hardly likely to be paid, whereas by taking you this morning to M. le\nComte'--Allow me,\" said the Consul, interrupting himself, \"to speak\nof my protector by his Christian name only, and to call him Comte\nOctave.--'By taking you this morning to M. le Comte Octave, I hope to\nsecure you his patronage, which, if you are so fortunate as to please\nthat virtuous statesman--as I make no doubt you can--will be worth, at\nleast, as much as the fortune I might have accumulated for you, if my\nbrother-in-law's ruin and my sister's death had not fallen on me like a\nthunder-bolt from a clear sky.'\n\n\"'Are you the Count's director?'\n\n\"'If I were, could I place you with him? What priest could be capable\nof taking advantage of the secrets which he learns at the tribunal of\nrepentance? No; you owe this position to his Highness, the Keeper of\nthe Seals. My dear Maurice, you will be as much at home there as in your\nfather's house. The Count will give you a salary of two thousand four\nhundred francs, rooms in his house, and an allowance of twelve hundred\nfrancs in lieu of feeding you. He will not admit you to his table,\nnor give you a separate table, for fear of leaving you to the care of\nservants. I did not accept the offer when it was made to me till I was\nperfectly certain that Comte Octave's secretary was never to be a mere\nupper servant. You will have an immense amount of work, for the Count\nis a great worker; but when you leave him, you will be qualified to fill\nthe highest posts. I need not warn you to be discreet; that is the first\nvirtue of any man who hopes to hold public appointments.'\n\n\"You may conceive of my curiosity. Comte Octave, at that time, held one\nof the highest legal appointments; he was in the confidence of Madame\nthe Dauphiness, who had just got him made a State Minister; he led such\na life as the Comte de Serizy, whom you all know, I think; but even more\nquietly, for his house was in the Marais, Rue Payenne, and he hardly\never entertained. His private life escaped public comment by its\nhermit-like simplicity and by constant hard work.\n\n\"Let me describe my position to you in a few words. Having found in the\nsolemn headmaster of the College Saint-Louis a tutor to whom my uncle\ndelegated his authority, at the age of eighteen I had gone through all\nthe classes; I left school as innocent as a seminarist, full of faith,\non quitting Saint-Sulpice. My mother, on her deathbed, had made my uncle\npromise that I should not become a priest, but I was as pious as though\nI had to take orders. On leaving college, the Abbe Loraux took me\ninto his house and made me study law. During the four years of study\nrequisite for passing all the examinations, I worked hard, but chiefly\nat things outside the arid fields of jurisprudence. Weaned from\nliterature as I had been at college, where I lived in the headmaster's\nhouse, I had a thirst to quench. As soon as I had read a few modern\nmasterpieces, the works of all the preceding ages were greedily\nswallowed. I became crazy about the theatre, and for a long time I went\nevery night to the play, though my uncle gave me only a hundred francs\na month. This parsimony, to which the good old man was compelled by his\nregard for the poor, had the effect of keeping a young man's desires\nwithin reasonable limits.\n\n\"When I went to live with Comte Octave I was not indeed an innocent, but\nI thought of my rare escapades as crimes. My uncle was so truly angelic,\nand I was so much afraid of grieving him, that in all those four years\nI had never spent a night out. The good man would wait till I came in\nto go to bed. This maternal care had more power to keep me within bounds\nthan the sermons and reproaches with which the life of a young man\nis diversified in a puritanical home. I was a stranger to the various\ncircles which make up the world of Paris society; I only knew some women\nof the better sort, and none of the inferior class but those I saw as I\nwalked about, or in the boxes at the play, and then only from the depths\nof the pit where I sat. If, at that period, any one had said to me, 'You\nwill see Canalis, or Camille Maupin,' I should have felt hot coals in\nmy head and in my bowels. Famous people were to me as gods, who neither\nspoke, nor walked, nor ate like other mortals.\n\n\"How many tales of the Thousand-and-one Nights are comprehended in the\nripening of a youth! How many wonderful lamps must we have rubbed before\nwe understand that the True Wonderful Lamp is either luck, or work, or\ngenius. In some men this dream of the aroused spirit is but brief; mine\nhas lasted until now! In those days I always went to sleep as Grand Duke\nof Tuscany,--as a millionaire,--as beloved by a princess,--or famous! So\nto enter the service of Comte Octave, and have a hundred louis a year,\nwas entering on independent life. I had glimpses of some chance of\ngetting into society, and seeking for what my heart desired most, a\nprotectress, who would rescue me from the paths of danger, which a young\nman of two-and-twenty can hardly help treading, however prudent and well\nbrought up he may be. I began to be afraid of myself.\n\n\"The persistent study of other people's rights into which I had plunged\nwas not always enough to repress painful imaginings. Yes, sometimes in\nfancy I threw myself into theatrical life; I thought I could be a great\nactor; I dreamed of endless triumphs and loves, knowing nothing of the\ndisillusion hidden behind the curtain, as everywhere else--for every\nstage has its reverse behind the scenes. I have gone out sometimes, my\nheart boiling, carried away by an impulse to rush hunting through Paris,\nto attach myself to some handsome woman I might meet, to follow her\nto her door, watch her, write to her, throw myself on her mercy, and\nconquer her by sheer force of passion. My poor uncle, a heart consumed\nby charity, a child of seventy years, as clear-sighted as God, as\nguileless as a man of genius, no doubt read the tumult of my soul; for\nwhen he felt the tether by which he held me strained too tightly and\nready to break, he would never fail to say, 'Here, Maurice, you too\nare poor! Here are twenty francs; go and amuse yourself, you are not a\npriest!' And if you could have seen the dancing light that gilded his\ngray eyes, the smile that relaxed his fine lips, puckering the corners\nof his mouth, the adorable expression of that august face, whose native\nugliness was redeemed by the spirit of an apostle, you would understand\nthe feeling which made me answer the Cure of White Friars only with a\nkiss, as if he had been my mother.\n\n\"'In Comte Octave you will find not a master, but a friend,' said my\nuncle on the way to the Rue Payenne. 'But he is distrustful, or to be\nmore exact, he is cautious. The statesman's friendship can be won only\nwith time; for in spite of his deep insight and his habit of gauging\nmen, he was deceived by the man you are succeeding, and nearly became a\nvictim to his abuse of confidence. This is enough to guide you in your\nbehavior to him.'\n\n\"When we knocked at the enormous outer door of a house as large as the\nHotel Carnavalet, with a courtyard in front and a garden behind, the\nsound rang as in a desert. While my uncle inquired of an old porter in\nlivery if the Count were at home, I cast my eyes, seeing everything\nat once, over the courtyard where the cobblestones were hidden in the\ngrass, the blackened walls where little gardens were flourishing above\nthe decorations of the elegant architecture, and on the roof, as high as\nthat of the Tuileries. The balustrade of the upper balconies was eaten\naway. Through a magnificent colonnade I could see a second court on one\nside, where were the offices; the door was rotting. An old coachman\nwas there cleaning an old carriage. The indifferent air of this servant\nallowed me to assume that the handsome stables, where of old so many\nhorses had whinnied, now sheltered two at most. The handsome facade of\nthe house seemed to me gloomy, like that of a mansion belonging to the\nState or the Crown, and given up to some public office. A bell rang as\nwe walked across, my uncle and I, from the porter's lodge--_Inquire of\nthe Porter_ was still written over the door--towards the outside steps,\nwhere a footman came out in a livery like that of Labranche at the\nTheatre Francais in the old stock plays. A visitor was so rare that the\nservant was putting his coat on when he opened a glass door with small\npanes, on each side of which the smoke of a lamp had traced patterns on\nthe walls.\n\n\"A hall so magnificent as to be worthy of Versailles ended in a\nstaircase such as will never again be built in France, taking up as much\nspace as the whole of a modern house. As we went up the marble steps, as\ncold as tombstones, and wide enough for eight persons to walk abreast,\nour tread echoed under sonorous vaulting. The banister charmed the eye\nby its miraculous workmanship--goldsmith's work in iron--wrought by the\nfancy of an artist of the time of Henri III. Chilled as by an icy mantle\nthat fell on our shoulders, we went through ante-rooms, drawing-rooms\nopening one out of the other, with carpetless parquet floors, and\nfurnished with such splendid antiquities as from thence would find their\nway to the curiosity dealers. At last we reached a large study in a\ncross wing, with all the windows looking into an immense garden.\n\n\"'Monsieur le Cure of the White Friars, and his nephew, Monsieur de\nl'Hostal,' said Labranche, to whose care the other theatrical servant\nhad consigned us in the first ante-chamber.\n\n\"Comte Octave, dressed in long trousers and a gray flannel morning coat,\nrose from his seat by a huge writing-table, came to the fireplace,\nand signed to me to sit down, while he went forward to take my uncle's\nhands, which he pressed.\n\n\"'Though I am in the parish of Saint-Paul,' said he, 'I could scarcely\nhave failed to hear of the Cure of the White Friars, and I am happy to\nmake his acquaintance.'\n\n\"'Your Excellency is most kind,' replied my uncle. 'I have brought to\nyou my only remaining relation. While I believe that I am offering a\ngood gift to your Excellency, I hope at the same time to give my nephew\na second father.'\n\n\"'As to that, I can only reply, Monsieur l'Abbe, when we shall have\ntried each other,' said Comte Octave. 'Your name?' he added to me.\n\n\"'Maurice.'\n\n\"'He has taken his doctor's degree in law,' my uncle observed.\n\n\"'Very good, very good!' said the Count, looking at me from head to\nfoot. 'Monsieur l'Abbe, I hope that for your nephew's sake in the first\ninstance, and then for mine, you will do me the honor of dining here\nevery Monday. That will be our family dinner, our family party.'\n\n\"My uncle and the Count then began to talk of religion from the\npolitical point of view, of charitable institutes, the repression of\ncrime, and I could at my leisure study the man on whom my fate would\nhenceforth depend. The Count was of middle height; it was impossible to\njudge of his build on account of his dress, but he seemed to me to\nbe lean and spare. His face was harsh and hollow; the features were\nrefined. His mouth, which was rather large, expressed both irony and\nkindliness. His forehead perhaps too spacious, was as intimidating as\nthat of a madman, all the more so from the contrast of the lower part of\nthe face, which ended squarely in a short chin very near the lower lip.\nSmall eyes, of turquoise blue, were as keen and bright as those of the\nPrince de Talleyrand--which I admired at a later time--and endowed, like\nthe Prince's, with the faculty of becoming expressionless to the verge\nof gloom; and they added to the singularity of a face that was not pale\nbut yellow. This complexion seemed to bespeak an irritable temper and\nviolent passions. His hair, already silvered, and carefully dressed,\nseemed to furrow his head with streaks of black and white alternately.\nThe trimness of this head spoiled the resemblance I had remarked in the\nCount to the wonderful monk described by Lewis after Schedoni in\nthe _Confessional of the Black Penitents (The Italian)_, a superior\ncreation, as it seems to me, to _The Monk_.\n\n\"The Count was already shaved, having to attend early at the law courts.\nTwo candelabra with four lights, screened by lamp-shades, were still\nburning at the opposite ends of the writing-table, and showed plainly\nthat the magistrate rose long before daylight. His hands, which I saw\nwhen he took hold of the bell-pull to summon his servant, were extremely\nfine, and as white as a woman's.\n\n\"As I tell you this story,\" said the Consul-General, interrupting\nhimself, \"I am altering the titles and the social position of this\ngentleman, while placing him in circumstances analogous to what his\nreally were. His profession, rank, luxury, fortune, and style of living\nwere the same; all these details are true, but I would not be false to\nmy benefactor, nor to my usual habits of discretion.\n\n\"Instead of feeling--as I really was, socially speaking--an insect in\nthe presence of an eagle,\" the narrator went on after a pause, \"I felt I\nknow not what indefinable impression from the Count's appearance,\nwhich, however, I can now account for. Artists of genius\" (and he\nbowed gracefully to the Ambassador, the distinguished lady, and the\ntwo Frenchmen), \"real statesmen, poets, a general who has commanded\narmies--in short, all really great minds are simple, and their\nsimplicity places you on a level with themselves.--You who are all of\nsuperior minds,\" he said, addressing his guests, \"have perhaps observed\nhow feeling can bridge over the distances created by society. If we\nare inferior to you in intellect, we can be your equals in devoted\nfriendship. By the temperature--allow me the word--of our hearts I felt\nmyself as near my patron as I was far below him in rank. In short, the\nsoul has its clairvoyance; it has presentiments of suffering, grief,\njoy, antagonism, or hatred in others.\n\n\"I vaguely discerned the symptoms of a mystery, from recognizing in the\nCount the same effects of physiognomy as I had observed in my uncle.\nThe exercise of virtue, serenity of conscience, and purity of mind had\ntransfigured my uncle, who from being ugly had become quite beautiful.\nI detected a metamorphosis of a reverse kind in the Count's face; at the\nfirst glance I thought he was about fifty-five, but after an attentive\nexamination I found youth entombed under the ice of a great sorrow,\nunder the fatigue of persistent study, under the glowing hues of some\nsuppressed passion. At a word from my uncle the Count's eyes recovered\nfor a moment the softness of the periwinkle flower, and he had an\nadmiring smile, which revealed what I believed to be his real age, about\nforty. These observations I made, not then but afterwards, as I recalled\nthe circumstances of my visit.\n\n\"The man-servant came in carrying a tray with his master's breakfast on\nit.\n\n\"'I did not ask for breakfast,' remarked the Count; 'but leave it, and\nshow monsieur to his rooms.'\n\n\"I followed the servant, who led the way to a complete set of pretty\nrooms, under a terrace, between the great courtyard and the servants'\nquarters, over a corridor of communication between the kitchens and\nthe grand staircase. When I returned to the Count's study, I overheard,\nbefore opening the door, my uncle pronouncing this judgment on me:\n\n\"'He may do wrong, for he has strong feelings, and we are all liable to\nhonorable mistakes; but he has no vices.'\n\n\"'Well,' said the Count, with a kindly look, 'do you like yourself\nthere? Tell me. There are so many rooms in this barrack that, if you\nwere not comfortable, I could put you elsewhere.'\n\n\"'At my uncle's I had but one room,' replied I.\n\n\"'Well, you can settle yourself this evening,' said the Count, 'for your\npossessions, no doubt, are such as all students own, and a hackney coach\nwill be enough to convey them. To-day we will all three dine together,'\nand he looked at my uncle.\n\n\"A splendid library opened from the Count's study, and he took us in\nthere, showing me a pretty little recess decorated with paintings, which\nhad formerly served, no doubt, as an oratory.\n\n\"'This is your cell,' said he. 'You will sit there when you have to work\nwith me, for you will not be tethered by a chain;' and he explained in\ndetail the kind and duration of my employment with him. As I listened I\nfelt that he was a great political teacher.\n\n\"It took me about a month to familiarize myself with people and things,\nto learn the duties of my new office, and accustom myself to the Count's\nmethods. A secretary necessarily watches the man who makes use of him.\nThat man's tastes, passions, temper, and manias become the subject of\ninvoluntary study. The union of their two minds is at once more and less\nthan a marriage.\n\n\"During these months the Count and I reciprocally studied each other. I\nlearned with astonishment that Comte Octave was but thirty-seven years\nold. The merely superficial peacefulness of his life and the propriety\nof his conduct were the outcome not solely of a deep sense of duty and\nof stoical reflection; in my constant intercourse with this man--an\nextraordinary man to those who knew him well--I felt vast depths beneath\nhis toil, beneath his acts of politeness, his mask of benignity, his\nassumption of resignation, which so closely resembled calmness that it\nis easy to mistake it. Just as when walking through forest-lands certain\nsoils give forth under our feet a sound which enables us to guess\nwhether they are dense masses of stone or a void; so intense egoism,\nthough hidden under the flowers of politeness, and subterranean caverns\neaten out by sorrow sound hollow under the constant touch of familiar\nlife. It was sorrow and not despondency that dwelt in that really great\nsoul. The Count had understood that actions, deeds, are the supreme law\nof social man. And he went on his way in spite of secret wounds, looking\nto the future with a tranquil eye, like a martyr full of faith.\n\n\"His concealed sadness, the bitter disenchantment from which he\nsuffered, had not led him into philosophical deserts of incredulity;\nthis brave statesman was religious, without ostentation; he always\nattended the earliest mass at Saint-Paul's for pious workmen and\nservants. Not one of his friends, no one at Court, knew that he so\npunctually fulfilled the practice of religion. He was addicted to God as\nsome men are addicted to a vice, with the greatest mystery. Thus one day\nI came to find the Count at the summit of an Alp of woe much higher than\nthat on which many are who think themselves the most tried; who laugh at\nthe passions and the beliefs of others because they have conquered their\nown; who play variations in every key of irony and disdain. He did not\nmock at those who still follow hope into the swamps whither she leads,\nnor those who climb a peak to be alone, nor those who persist in the\nfight, reddening the arena with their blood and strewing it with their\nillusions. He looked on the world as a whole; he mastered its beliefs;\nhe listened to its complaining; he was doubtful of affection, and yet\nmore of self-sacrifice; but this great and stern judge pitied them,\nor admired them, not with transient enthusiasm, but with silence,\nconcentration, and the communion of a deeply-touched soul. He was a sort\nof catholic Manfred, and unstained by crime, carrying his choiceness\ninto his faith, melting the snows by the fires of a sealed volcano,\nholding converse with a star seen by himself alone!\n\n\"I detected many dark riddles in his ordinary life. He evaded my gaze\nnot like a traveler who, following a path, disappears from time to time\nin dells or ravines according to the formation of the soil, but like a\nsharpshooter who is being watched, who wants to hide himself, and seeks\na cover. I could not account for his frequent absences at the times when\nhe was working the hardest, and of which he made no secret from me, for\nhe would say, 'Go on with this for me,' and trust me with the work in\nhand.\n\n\"This man, wrapped in the threefold duties of the statesman, the judge,\nand the orator, charmed me by a taste for flowers, which shows an\nelegant mind, and which is shared by almost all persons of refinement.\nHis garden and his study were full of the rarest plants, but he always\nbought them half-withered. Perhaps it pleased him to see such an image\nof his own fate! He was faded like these dying flowers, whose almost\ndecaying fragrance mounted strangely to his brain. The Count loved his\ncountry; he devoted himself to public interests with the frenzy of a\nheart that seeks to cheat some other passion; but the studies and\nwork into which he threw himself were not enough for him; there were\nfrightful struggles in his mind, of which some echoes reached me.\nFinally, he would give utterance to harrowing aspirations for happiness,\nand it seemed to me he ought yet to be happy; but what was the obstacle?\nWas there a woman he loved? This was a question I asked myself. You may\nimagine the extent of the circles of torment that my mind had searched\nbefore coming to so simple and so terrible a question. Notwithstanding\nhis efforts, my patron did not succeed in stifling the movements of his\nheart. Under his austere manner, under the reserve of the magistrate, a\npassion rebelled, though coerced with such force that no one but I\nwho lived with him ever guessed the secret. His motto seemed to be,\n'I suffer, and am silent.' The escort of respect and admiration\nwhich attended him; the friendship of workers as valiant as\nhimself--Grandville and Serizy, both presiding judges--had no hold over\nthe Count: either he told them nothing, or they knew all. Impassible and\nlofty in public, the Count betrayed the man only on rare intervals when,\nalone in his garden or his study, he supposed himself unobserved; but\nthen he was a child again, he gave course to the tears hidden beneath\nthe toga, to the excitement which, if wrongly interpreted, might have\ndamaged his credit for perspicacity as a statesman.\n\n\"When all this had become to me a matter of certainty, Comte Octave had\nall the attractions of a problem, and won on my affection as much as\nthough he had been my own father. Can you enter into the feeling of\ncuriosity, tempered by respect? What catastrophe had blasted this\nlearned man, who, like Pitt, had devoted himself from the age of\neighteen to the studies indispensable to power, while he had no\nambition; this judge, who thoroughly knew the law of nations, political\nlaw, civil and criminal law, and who could find in these a weapon\nagainst every anxiety, against every mistake; this profound legislator,\nthis serious writer, this pious celibate whose life sufficiently proved\nthat he was open to no reproach? A criminal could not have been more\nhardly punished by God than was my master; sorrow had robbed him of half\nhis slumbers; he never slept more than four hours. What struggle was\nit that went on in the depths of these hours apparently so calm, so\nstudious, passing without a sound or a murmur, during which I often\ndetected him, when the pen had dropped from his fingers, with his head\nresting on one hand, his eyes like two fixed stars, and sometimes wet\nwith tears? How could the waters of that living spring flow over the\nburning strand without being dried up by the subterranean fire? Was\nthere below it, as there is under the sea, between it and the central\nfires of the globe, a bed of granite? And would the volcano burst at\nlast?\n\n\"Sometimes the Count would give me a look of that sagacious and\nkeen-eyed curiosity by which one man searches another when he desires\nan accomplice; then he shunned my eye as he saw it open a mouth, so to\nspeak, insisting on a reply, and seeming to say, 'Speak first!' Now and\nthen Comte Octave's melancholy was surly and gruff. If these spurts of\ntemper offended me, he could get over it without thinking of asking my\npardon; but then his manners were gracious to the point of Christian\nhumility.\n\n\"When I became attached like a son to this man--to me such a mystery,\nbut so intelligible to the outer world, to whom the epithet eccentric is\nenough to account for all the enigmas of the heart--I changed the state\nof the house. Neglect of his own interests was carried by the Count\nto the length of folly in the management of his affairs. Possessing an\nincome of about a hundred and sixty thousand francs, without including\nthe emoluments of his appointments--three of which did not come under\nthe law against plurality--he spent sixty thousand, of which at least\nthirty thousand went to his servants. By the end of the first year I\nhad got rid of all these rascals, and begged His Excellency to use his\ninfluence in helping me to get honest servants. By the end of the second\nyear the Count, better fed and better served, enjoyed the comforts of\nmodern life; he had fine horses, supplied by a coachman to whom I paid\nso much a month for each horse; his dinners on his reception days,\nfurnished by Chevet at a price agreed upon, did him credit; his daily\nmeals were prepared by an excellent cook found by my uncle, and helped\nby two kitchenmaids. The expenditure for housekeeping, not including\npurchases, was no more than thirty thousand francs a year; we had two\nadditional men-servants, whose care restored the poetical aspect of the\nhouse; for this old palace, splendid even in its rust, had an air of\ndignity which neglect had dishonored.\n\n\"'I am no longer astonished,' said he, on hearing of these results, 'at\nthe fortunes made by servants. In seven years I have had two cooks, who\nhave become rich restaurant-keepers.'\n\n\"Early in the year 1826 the Count had, no doubt, ceased to watch me, and\nwe were as closely attached as two men can be when one is subordinate to\nthe other. He had never spoken to me of my future prospects, but he had\ntaken an interest, both as a master and as a father, in training me. He\noften required me to collect materials for his most arduous labors;\nI drew up some of his reports, and he corrected them, showing the\ndifference between his interpretation of the law, his views and mine.\nWhen at last I had produced a document which he could give in as his own\nhe was delighted; this satisfaction was my reward, and he could see that\nI took it so. This little incident produced an extraordinary effect on a\nsoul which seemed so stern. The Count pronounced sentence on me, to\nuse a legal phrase, as supreme and royal judge; he took my head in his\nhands, and kissed me on the forehead.\n\n\"'Maurice,' he exclaimed, 'you are no longer my apprentice; I know not\nyet what you will be to me--but if no change occurs in my life, perhaps\nyou will take the place of a son.'\n\n\"Comte Octave had introduced me to the best houses in Paris, whither I\nwent in his stead, with his servants and carriage, on the too frequent\noccasions when, on the point of starting, he changed his mind, and sent\nfor a hackney cab to take him--Where?--that was the mystery. By the\nwelcome I met with I could judge of the Count's feelings towards me, and\nthe earnestness of his recommendations. He supplied all my wants with\nthe thoughtfulness of a father, and with all the greater liberality\nbecause my modesty left it to him always to think of me. Towards the\nend of January 1827, at the house of the Comtesse de Serizy, I had such\npersistent ill-luck at play that I lost two thousand francs, and I would\nnot draw them out of my savings. Next morning I asked myself, 'Had I\nbetter ask my uncle for the money, or put my confidence in the Count?'\n\n\"I decided on the second alternative.\n\n\"'Yesterday,' said I, when he was at breakfast, 'I lost persistently at\nplay; I was provoked, and went on; I owe two thousand francs. Will you\nallow me to draw the sum on account of my year's salary?'\n\n\"'No,' said he, with the sweetest smile; 'when a man plays in society,\nhe must have a gambling purse. Draw six thousand francs; pay your debts.\nHenceforth we must go halves; for since you are my representative on\nmost occasions, your self-respect must not be made to suffer for it.'\n\n\"I made no speech of thanks. Thanks would have been superfluous between\nus. This shade shows the character of our relations. And yet we had not\nyet unlimited confidence in each other; he did not open to me the vast\nsubterranean chambers which I had detected in his secret life; and\nI, for my part, never said to him, 'What ails you? From what are you\nsuffering?'\n\n\"What could he be doing during those long evenings? He would often come\nin on foot or in a hackney cab when I returned in a carriage--I, his\nsecretary! Was so pious a man a prey to vices hidden under hypocrisy?\nDid he expend all the powers of his mind to satisfy a jealousy more\ndexterous than Othello's? Did he live with some woman unworthy of him?\nOne morning, on returning from I have forgotten what shop, where I had\njust paid a bill, between the Church of Saint-Paul and the Hotel de\nVille, I came across Comte Octave in such eager conversation with an old\nwoman that he did not see me. The appearance of this hag filled me with\nstrange suspicions, suspicions that were all the better founded because\nI never found that the Count invested his savings. Is it not shocking to\nthink of? I was constituting myself my patron's censor. At that time I\nknew that he had more than six hundred thousand francs to invest; and\nif he had bought securities of any kind, his confidence in me was so\ncomplete in all that concerned his pecuniary interests, that I certainly\nshould have known it.\n\n\"Sometimes, in the morning, the Count took exercise in his garden, to\nand fro, like a man to whom a walk is the hippogryph ridden by dreamy\nmelancholy. He walked and walked! And he rubbed his hands enough to\nrub the skin off. And then, if I met him unexpectedly as he came to\nthe angle of a path, I saw his face beaming. His eyes, instead of\nthe hardness of a turquoise, had that velvety softness of the blue\nperiwinkle, which had so much struck me on the occasion of my first\nvisit, by reason of the astonishing contrast in the two different looks;\nthe look of a happy man, and the look of an unhappy man. Two or three\ntimes at such a moment he had taken me by the arm and led me on; then\nhe had said, 'What have you come to ask?' instead of pouring out his\njoy into my heart that opened to him. But more often, especially since\nI could do his work for him and write his reports, the unhappy man would\nsit for hours staring at the goldfish that swarmed in a handsome marble\nbasin in the middle of the garden, round which grew an amphitheatre\nof the finest flowers. He, an accomplished statesman, seemed to have\nsucceeded in making a passion of the mechanical amusement of crumbling\nbread to fishes.\n\n\"This is how the drama was disclosed of this second inner life, so\ndeeply ravaged and storm-tossed, where, in a circle overlooked by Dante\nin his _Inferno_, horrible joys had their birth.\"\n\nThe Consul-General paused.\n\n\n\n\"On a certain Monday,\" he resumed, \"as chance would have it, M. le\nPresident de Grandville and M. de Serizy (at that time Vice-President\nof the Council of State) had come to hold a meeting at Comte Octave's\nhouse. They formed a committee of three, of which I was the secretary.\nThe Count had already got me the appointment of Auditor to the Council\nof State. All the documents requisite for their inquiry into the\npolitical matter privately submitted to these three gentlemen were laid\nout on one of the long tables in the library. MM. de Grandville and de\nSerizy had trusted to the Count to make the preliminary examination of\nthe papers relating to the matter. To avoid the necessity for carrying\nall the papers to M. de Serizy, as president of the commission, it was\ndecided that they should meet first in the Rue Payenne. The Cabinet at\nthe Tuileries attached great importance to this piece of work, of which\nthe chief burden fell on me--and to which I owed my appointment, in the\ncourse of that year, to be Master of Appeals.\n\n\"Though the Comtes de Grandville and de Serizy, whose habits were much\nthe same as my patron's, never dined away from home, we were still\ndiscussing the matter at a late hour, when we were startled by the\nman-servant calling me aside to say, 'MM. the Cures of Saint-Paul and of\nthe White Friars have been waiting in the drawing-room for two hours.'\n\n\"It was nine o'clock.\n\n\"'Well, gentlemen, you find yourselves compelled to dine with priests,'\nsaid Comte Octave to his colleagues. 'I do not know whether Grandville\ncan overcome his horror of a priest's gown----'\n\n\"'It depends on the priest.'\n\n\"'One of them is my uncle, and the other is the Abbe Gaudron,' said\nI. 'Do not be alarmed; the Abbe Fontanon is no longer second priest at\nSaint-Paul----'\n\n\"'Well, let us dine,' replied the President de Grandville. 'A bigot\nfrightens me, but there is no one so cheerful as a truly pious man.'\n\n\"We went into the drawing-room. The dinner was delightful. Men of\nreal information, politicians to whom business gives both consummate\nexperience and the practice of speech, are admirable story-tellers, when\nthey tell stories. With them there is no medium; they are either heavy,\nor they are sublime. In this delightful sport Prince Metternich is as\ngood as Charles Nodier. The fun of a statesman, cut in facets like a\ndiamond, is sharp, sparkling, and full of sense. Being sure that the\nproprieties would be observed by these three superior men, my uncle\nallowed his wit full play, a refined wit, gentle, penetrating, and\nelegant, like that of all men who are accustomed to conceal their\nthoughts under the black robe. And you may rely upon it, there was\nnothing vulgar nor idle in this light talk, which I would compare, for\nits effect on the soul, to Rossini's music.\n\n\"The Abbe Gaudron was, as M. de Grandville said, a Saint Peter rather\nthan a Saint Paul, a peasant full of faith, as square on his feet as he\nwas tall, a sacerdotal of whose ignorance in matters of the world and\nof literature enlivened the conversation by guileless amazement and\nunexpected questions. They came to talking of one of the plague spots\nof social life, of which we were just now speaking--adultery. My uncle\nremarked on the contradiction which the legislators of the Code, still\nfeeling the blows of the revolutionary storm, had established between\ncivil and religious law, and which he said was at the root of all the\nmischief.\n\n\"'In the eyes of the Church,' said he, 'adultery is a crime; in those of\nyour tribunals it is a misdemeanor. Adultery drives to the police court\nin a carriage instead of standing at the bar to be tried. Napoleon's\nCouncil of State, touched with tenderness towards erring women, was\nquite inefficient. Ought they not in this case to have harmonized the\ncivil and the religious law, and have sent the guilty wife to a convent,\nas of old?'\n\n\"'To a convent!' said M. de Serizy. 'They must first have created\nconvents, and in those days monasteries were being turned into barracks.\nBesides, think of what you say, M. l'Abbe--give to God what society\nwould have none of?'\n\n\"'Oh!' said the Comte de Grandville, 'you do not know France. They were\nobliged to leave the husband free to take proceedings: well, there are\nnot ten cases of adultery brought up in a year.'\n\n\"'M. l'Abbe preaches for his own saint, for it was Jesus Christ who\ninvented adultery,' said Comte Octave. 'In the East, the cradle of\nthe human race, woman was merely a luxury, and there was regarded as a\nchattel; no virtues were demanded of her but obedience and beauty.\nBy exalting the soul above the body, the modern family in Europe--a\ndaughter of Christ--invented indissoluble marriage, and made it a\nsacrament.'\n\n\"'Ah! the Church saw the difficulties,' exclaimed M. de Grandville.\n\n\"'This institution has given rise to a new world,' the Count went on\nwith a smile. 'But the practices of that world will never be that of\na climate where women are marriageable at seven years of age, and more\nthan old at five-and-twenty. The Catholic Church overlooked the needs of\nhalf the globe.--So let us discuss Europe only.\n\n\"'Is woman our superior or our inferior? That is the real question so\nfar as we are concerned. If woman is our inferior, by placing her on so\nhigh a level as the Church does, fearful punishments for adultery were\nneedful. And formerly that was what was done. The cloister or death sums\nup early legislation. But since then practice has modified the law, as\nis always the case. The throne served as a hotbed for adultery, and the\nincrease of this inviting crime marks the decline of the dogmas of the\nCatholic Church. In these days, in cases where the Church now exacts no\nmore than sincere repentance from the erring wife, society is satisfied\nwith a brand-mark instead of an execution. The law still condemns\nthe guilty, but it no longer terrifies them. In short, there are two\nstandards of morals: that of the world, and that of the Code. Where the\nCode is weak, as I admit with our dear Abbe, the world is audacious and\nsatirical. There are so few judges who would not gladly have committed\nthe fault against which they hurl the rather stolid thunders of their\n\"Inasmuch.\" The world, which gives the lie to the law alike in its\nrejoicings, in its habits, and in its pleasures, is severer than the\nCode and the Church; the world punishes a blunder after encouraging\nhypocrisy. The whole economy of the law on marriage seems to me to\nrequire reconstruction from the bottom to the top. The French law would\nbe perfect perhaps if it excluded daughters from inheriting.'\n\n\"'We three among us know the question very thoroughly,' said the Comte\nde Grandville with a laugh. 'I have a wife I cannot live with. Serizy\nhas a wife who will not live with him. As for you, Octave, yours\nran away from you. So we three represent every case of the conjugal\nconscience, and, no doubt, if ever divorce is brought in again, we shall\nform the committee.'\n\n\"Octave's fork dropped on his glass, broke it, and broke his plate. He\nhad turned as pale as death, and flashed a thunderous glare at M. de\nGrandville, by which he hinted at my presence, and which I caught.\n\n\"'Forgive me, my dear fellow. I did not see Maurice,' the President went\non. 'Serizy and I, after being the witnesses to your marriage, became\nyour accomplices; I did not think I was committing an indiscretion in\nthe presence of these two venerable priests.'\n\n\"M. de Serizy changed the subject by relating all he had done to please\nhis wife without ever succeeding. The old man concluded that it was\nimpossible to regulate human sympathies and antipathies; he maintained\nthat social law was never more perfect than when it was nearest to\nnatural law. Now Nature takes no account of the affinities of souls; her\naim is fulfilled by the propagation of the species. Hence, the Code,\nin its present form, was wise in leaving a wide latitude to chance. The\nincapacity of daughters to inherit so long as there were male heirs was\nan excellent provision, whether to hinder the degeneration of the race,\nor to make households happier by abolishing scandalous unions and giving\nthe sole preference to moral qualities and beauty.\n\n\"'But then,' he exclaimed, lifting his hand with a gesture of disgust,\n'how are we to perfect legislation in a country which insists on\nbringing together seven or eight hundred legislators!--After all, if I\nam sacrificed,' he added, 'I have a child to succeed me.'\n\n\"'Setting aside all the religious question,' my uncle said, 'I would\nremark to your Excellency that Nature only owes us life, and that it is\nsociety that owes us happiness. Are you a father?' asked my uncle.\n\n\"'And I--have I any children?' said Comte Octave in a hollow voice, and\nhis tone made such an impression that there was no more talk of wives or\nmarriage.\n\n\"When coffee had been served, the two Counts and the two priests stole\naway, seeing that poor Octave had fallen into a fit of melancholy which\nprevented his noticing their disappearance. My patron was sitting in an\narmchair by the fire, in the attitude of a man crushed.\n\n\"'You now know the secret of my life, said he to me on noticing that we\nwere alone. 'After three years of married life, one evening when I came\nin I found a letter in which the Countess announced her flight. The\nletter did not lack dignity, for it is in the nature of women to\npreserve some virtues even when committing that horrible sin.--The\nstory is now that my wife went abroad in a ship that was wrecked; she\nis supposed to be dead. I have lived alone for seven years!--Enough for\nthis evening, Maurice. We will talk of my situation when I have grown\nused to the idea of speaking of it to you. When we suffer from a\nchronic disease, it needs time to become accustomed to improvement. That\nimprovement often seems to be merely another aspect of the complaint.'\n\n\"I went to bed greatly agitated; for the mystery, far from being\nexplained, seemed to me more obscure than ever. I foresaw some strange\ndrama indeed, for I understood that there could be no vulgar difference\nbetween the woman that Count could choose and such a character as his.\nThe events which had driven the Countess to leave a man so noble, so\namiable, so perfect, so loving, so worthy to be loved, must have been\nsingular, to say the least. M. de Grandville's remark had been like a\ntorch flung into the caverns over which I had so long been walking; and\nthough the flame lighted them but dimly, my eyes could perceive their\nwide extent! I could imagine the Count's sufferings without knowing\ntheir depths or their bitterness. That sallow face, those parched\ntemples, those overwhelming studies, those moments of absentmindedness,\nthe smallest details of the life of this married bachelor, all stood out\nin luminous relief during the hour of mental questioning, which is,\nas it were, the twilight before sleep, and to which any man would have\ngiven himself up, as I did.\n\n\"Oh! how I loved my poor master! He seemed to me sublime. I read a poem\nof melancholy, I saw perpetual activity in the heart I had accused of\nbeing torpid. Must not supreme grief always come at last to stagnation?\nHad this judge, who had so much in his power, ever revenged himself? Was\nhe feeding himself on her long agony? Is it not a remarkable thing in\nParis to keep anger always seething for ten years? What had Octave done\nsince this great misfortune--for the separation of husband and wife is\na great misfortune in our day, when domestic life has become a social\nquestion, which it never was of old?\n\n\"We allowed a few days to pass on the watch, for great sorrows have a\ndiffidence of their own; but at last, one evening, the Count said in a\ngrave voice:\n\n\"'Stay.'\n\n\n\n\"This, as nearly as may be, is his story.\n\n\"'My father had a ward, rich and lovely, who was sixteen at the time\nwhen I came back from college to live in this old house. Honorine, who\nhad been brought up by my mother, was just awakening to life. Full of\ngrace and of childish ways, she dreamed of happiness as she would have\ndreamed of jewels; perhaps happiness seemed to her the jewel of the\nsoul. Her piety was not free from puerile pleasures; for everything,\neven religion, was poetry to her ingenuous heart. She looked to the\nfuture as a perpetual fete. Innocent and pure, no delirium had disturbed\nher dream. Shame and grief had never tinged her cheek nor moistened\nher eye. She did not even inquire into the secret of her involuntary\nemotions on a fine spring day. And then, she felt that she was weak and\ndestined to obedience, and she awaited marriage without wishing for\nit. Her smiling imagination knew nothing of the corruption--necessary\nperhaps--which literature imparts by depicting the passions; she knew\nnothing of the world, and was ignorant of all the dangers of society.\nThe dear child had suffered so little that she had not even developed\nher courage. In short, her guilelessness would have led her to walk\nfearless among serpents, like the ideal figure of Innocence a painter\nonce created. We lived together like two brothers.\n\n\"'At the end of a year I said to her one day, in the garden of this\nhouse, by the basin, as we stood throwing crumbs to the fish:\n\n\"'\"Would you like that we should be married? With me you could do\nwhatever you please, while another man would make you unhappy.\"\n\n\"'\"Mamma,\" said she to my mother, who came out to join us, \"Octave and I\nhave agreed to be married----\"\n\n\"'\"What! at seventeen?\" said my mother. \"No, you must wait eighteen\nmonths; and if eighteen months hence you like each other, well, your\nbirth and fortunes are equal, you can make a marriage which is suitable,\nas well as being a love match.\"\n\n\"'When I was six-and-twenty, and Honorine nineteen, we were married.\nOur respect for my father and mother, old folks of the Bourbon Court,\nhindered us from making this house fashionable, or renewing the\nfurniture; we lived on, as we had done in the past, as children.\nHowever, I went into society; I initiated my wife into the world of\nfashion; and I regarded it as one of my duties to instruct her.\n\n\"'I recognized afterwards that marriages contracted under such\ncircumstances as ours bear in themselves a rock against which many\naffections are wrecked, many prudent calculations, many lives. The\nhusband becomes a pedagogue, or, if you like, a professor, and love\nperishes under the rod which, sooner or later, gives pain; for a young\nand handsome wife, at once discreet and laughter-loving, will not accept\nany superiority above that with which she is endowed by nature. Perhaps\nI was in the wrong? During the difficult beginnings of a household I,\nperhaps, assumed a magisterial tone? On the other hand, I may have made\nthe mistake of trusting too entirely to that artless nature; I kept no\nwatch over the Countess, in whom revolt seemed to me impossible? Alas!\nneither in politics nor in domestic life has it yet been ascertained\nwhether empires and happiness are wrecked by too much confidence or too\nmuch severity! Perhaps again, the husband failed to realize Honorine's\ngirlish dreams? Who can tell, while happy days last, what precepts he\nhas neglected?'\n\n\"I remember only the broad outlines of the reproaches the Count\naddressed to himself, with all the good faith of an anatomist seeking\nthe cause of a disease which might be overlooked by his brethren; but\nhis merciful indulgence struck me then as really worthy of that of Jesus\nChrist when He rescued the woman taken in adultery.\n\n\"'It was eighteen months after my father's death--my mother followed him\nto the tomb in a few months--when the fearful night came which surprised\nme by Honorine's farewell letter. What poetic delusion had seduced my\nwife? Was it through her senses? Was it the magnetism of misfortune\nor of genius? Which of these powers had taken her by storm or misled\nher?--I would not know. The blow was so terrible, that for a month I\nremained stunned. Afterwards, reflection counseled me to continue in\nignorance, and Honorine's misfortunes have since taught me too much\nabout all these things.--So far, Maurice, the story is commonplace\nenough; but one word will change it all: I love Honorine, I have never\nceased to worship her. From the day when she left me I have lived on\nmemory; one by one I recall the pleasures for which Honorine no doubt\nhad no taste.\n\n\"'Oh!' said he, seeing the amazement in my eyes, 'do not make a hero of\nme, do not think me such a fool, as the Colonel of the Empire would say,\nas to have sought no diversion. Alas, my boy! I was either too young or\ntoo much in love; I have not in the whole world met with another woman.\nAfter frightful struggles with myself, I tried to forget; money in hand,\nI stood on the very threshold of infidelity, but there the memory of\nHonorine rose before me like a white statue. As I recalled the infinite\ndelicacy of that exquisite skin, through which the blood might be seen\ncoursing and the nerves quivering; as I saw in fancy that ingenuous\nface, as guileless on the eve of my sorrows as on the day when I said\nto her, \"Shall we marry?\" as I remembered a heavenly fragrance, the\nvery odor of virtue, and the light in her eyes, the prettiness of her\nmovements, I fled like a man preparing to violate a tomb, who sees\nemerging from it the transfigured soul of the dead. At consultations,\nin Court, by night, I dream so incessantly of Honorine that only by\nexcessive strength of mind do I succeed in attending to what I am doing\nand saying. This is the secret of my labors.\n\n\"'Well, I felt no more anger with her than a father can feel on seeing\nhis beloved child in some danger it has imprudently rushed into. I\nunderstood that I had made a poem of my wife--a poem I delighted in\nwith such intoxication, that I fancied she shared the intoxication. Ah!\nMaurice, an indiscriminating passion in a husband is a mistake that may\nlead to any crime in a wife. I had no doubt left all the faculties of\nthis child, loved as a child, entirely unemployed; I had perhaps wearied\nher with my love before the hour of loving had struck for her! Too young\nto understand that in the constancy of the wife lies the germ of the\nmother's devotion, she mistook this first test of marriage for life\nitself, and the refractory child cursed life, unknown to me, nor daring\nto complain to me, out of sheer modesty perhaps! In so cruel a position\nshe would be defenceless against any man who stirred her deeply.--And\nI, so wise a judge as they say--I, who have a kind heart, but whose mind\nwas absorbed--I understood too late these unwritten laws of the woman's\ncode, I read them by the light of the fire that wrecked my roof. Then I\nconstituted my heart a tribunal by virtue of the law, for the law makes\nthe husband a judge: I acquitted my wife, and I condemned myself. But\nlove took possession of me as a passion, the mean, despotic passion\nwhich comes over some old men. At this day I love the absent Honorine as\na man of sixty loves a woman whom he must possess at any cost, and yet\nI feel the strength of a young man. I have the insolence of the old man\nand the reserve of a boy.--My dear fellow, society only laughs at such\na desperate conjugal predicament. Where it pities a lover, it regards a\nhusband as ridiculously inept; it makes sport of those who cannot keep\nthe woman they have secured under the canopy of the Church, and before\nthe Maire's scarf of office. And I had to keep silence.\n\n\"'Serizy is happy. His indulgence allows him to see his wife; he can\nprotect and defend her; and, as he adores her, he knows all the perfect\njoys of a benefactor whom nothing can disturb, not even ridicule, for he\npours it himself on his fatherly pleasures. \"I remain married only for\nmy wife's sake,\" he said to me one day on coming out of court.\n\n\"'But I--I have nothing; I have not even to face ridicule, I who live\nsolely on a love which is starving! I who can never find a word to say\nto a woman of the world! I who loathe prostitution! I who am faithful\nunder a spell!--But for my religious faith, I should have killed myself.\nI have defied the gulf of hard work; I have thrown myself into it, and\ncome out again alive, fevered, burning, bereft of sleep!----'\n\n\"I cannot remember all the words of this eloquent man, to whom passion\ngave an eloquence indeed so far above that of the pleader that, as I\nlistened to him, I, like him, felt my cheeks wet with tears. You may\nconceive of my feelings when, after a pause, during which we dried them\naway, he finished his story with this revelation:--\n\n\"'This is the drama of my soul, but it is not the actual living drama\nwhich is at this moment being acted in Paris! The interior drama\ninterests nobody. I know it; and you will one day admit that it is so,\nyou, who at this moment shed tears with me; no one can burden his heart\nor his skin with another's pain. The measure of our sufferings is in\nourselves.--You even understand my sorrows only by very vague analogy.\nCould you see me calming the most violent frenzy of despair by the\ncontemplation of a miniature in which I can see and kiss her brow, the\nsmile on her lips, the shape of her face, can breathe the whiteness of\nher skin; which enables me almost to feel, to play with the black masses\nof her curling hair?--Could you see me when I leap with hope--when I\nwrithe under the myriad darts of despair--when I tramp through the mire\nof Paris to quell my irritation by fatigue? I have fits of collapse\ncomparable to those of a consumptive patient, moods of wild hilarity,\nterrors as of a murderer who meets a sergeant of police. In short, my\nlife is a continual paroxysm of fears, joy, and dejection.\n\n\"'As to the drama--it is this. You imagine that I am occupied with the\nCouncil of State, the Chamber, the Courts, Politics.--Why, dear me,\nseven hours at night are enough for all that, so much are my faculties\noverwrought by the life I lead! Honorine is my real concern. To\nrecover my wife is my only study; to guard her in her cage, without her\nsuspecting that she is in my power; to satisfy her needs, to supply the\nlittle pleasure she allows herself, to be always about her like a sylph\nwithout allowing her to see or to suspect me, for if she did, the future\nwould be lost,--that is my life, my true life.--For seven years I\nhave never gone to bed without going first to see the light of her\nnight-lamp, or her shadow on the window curtains.\n\n\"'She left my house, choosing to take nothing but the dress she wore\nthat day. The child carried her magnanimity to the point of folly!\nConsequently, eighteen months after her flight she was deserted by her\nlover, who was appalled by the cold, cruel, sinister, and revolting\naspect of poverty--the coward! The man had, no doubt, counted on the\neasy and luxurious life in Switzerland or Italy which fine ladies\nindulge in when they leave their husbands. Honorine has sixty thousand\nfrancs a year of her own. The wretch left the dear creature expecting an\ninfant, and without a penny. In the month of November 1820 I found means\nto persuade the best _accoucheur_ in Paris to play the part of a humble\nsuburban apothecary. I induced the priest of the parish in which the\nCountess was living to supply her needs as though he were performing an\nact of charity. Then to hide my wife, to secure her against discovery,\nto find her a housekeeper who would be devoted to me and be my\nintelligent confidante--it was a task worthy of Figaro! You may suppose\nthat to discover where my wife had taken refuge I had only to make up my\nmind to it.\n\n\"'After three months of desperation rather than despair, the idea of\ndevoting myself to Honorine with God only in my secret, was one of those\npoems which occur only to the heart of a lover through life and death!\nLove must have its daily food. And ought I not to protect this child,\nwhose guilt was the outcome of my imprudence, against fresh disaster--to\nfulfil my part, in short, as a guardian angel?--At the age of seven\nmonths her infant died, happily for her and for me. For nine months more\nmy wife lay between life and death, deserted at the time when she most\nneeded a manly arm; but this arm,' said he, holding out his own with a\ngesture of angelic dignity, 'was extended over her head. Honorine was\nnursed as she would have been in her own home. When, on her recovery,\nshe asked how and by whom she had been assisted, she was told--\"By the\nSisters of Charity in the neighborhood--by the Maternity Society--by the\nparish priest, who took an interest in her.\"\n\n\"'This woman, whose pride amounts to a vice, has shown a power of\nresistance in misfortune, which on some evenings I call the obstinacy of\na mule. Honorine was bent on earning her living. My wife works! For five\nyears past I have lodged her in the Rue Saint-Maur, in a charming little\nhouse, where she makes artificial flowers and articles of fashion. She\nbelieves that she sells the product of her elegant fancywork to a shop,\nwhere she is so well paid that she makes twenty francs a day, and in\nthese six years she had never had a moment's suspicion. She pays for\neverything she needs at about the third of its value, so that on six\nthousand francs a year she lives as if she had fifteen thousand. She is\ndevoted to flowers, and pays a hundred crowns to a gardener, who costs\nme twelve hundred in wages, and sends me in a bill for two thousand\nfrancs every three months. I have promised the man a market-garden with\na house on it close to the porter's lodge in the Rue Saint-Maur. I\nhold this ground in the name of a clerk of the law courts. The smallest\nindiscretion would ruin the gardener's prospects. Honorine has her\nlittle house, a garden, and a splendid hothouse, for a rent of\nfive hundred francs a year. There she lives under the name of her\nhousekeeper, Madame Gobain, the old woman of impeccable discretion whom\nI was so lucky as to find, and whose affection Honorine has won. But her\nzeal, like that of the gardener, is kept hot by the promise of reward at\nthe moment of success. The porter and his wife cost me dreadfully dear\nfor the same reasons. However, for three years Honorine has been happy,\nbelieving that she owes to her own toil all the luxury of flowers,\ndress, and comfort.\n\n\"'Oh! I know what you are about to say,' cried the Count, seeing a\nquestion in my eyes and on my lips. 'Yes, yes; I have made the attempt.\nMy wife was formerly living in the Faubourg Saint-Antoine. One day when,\nfrom what Gobain told me, I believed in some chance of a reconciliation,\nI wrote by post a letter, in which I tried to propitiate my wife--a\nletter written and re-written twenty times! I will not describe my\nagonies. I went from the Rue Payenne to the Rue de Reuilly like a\ncondemned wretch going from the Palais de Justice to his execution, but\nhe goes on a cart, and I was on foot. It was dark--there was a fog; I\nwent to meet Madame Gobain, who was to come and tell me what my wife had\ndone. Honorine, on recognizing my writing, had thrown the letter into\nthe fire without reading it.--\"Madame Gobain,\" she had exclaimed, \"I\nleave this to-morrow.\"\n\n\"'What a dagger-stroke was this to a man who found inexhaustible\npleasure in the trickery by which he gets the finest Lyons velvet at\ntwelve francs a yard, a pheasant, a fish, a dish of fruit, for a tenth\nof their value, for a woman so ignorant as to believe that she is paying\nample wages with two hundred and fifty francs to Madame Gobain, a cook\nfit for a bishop.\n\n\"'You have sometimes found me rubbing my hands in the enjoyment of a\nsort of happiness. Well, I had just succeeded in some ruse worthy of\nthe stage. I had just deceived my wife--I had sent her by a purchaser\nof wardrobes an Indian shawl, to be offered to her as the property of an\nactress who had hardly worn it, but in which I--the solemn lawyer whom\nyou know--had wrapped myself for a night! In short, my life at this\nday may be summed up in the two words which express the extremes of\ntorment--I love, and I wait! I have in Madame Gobain a faithful spy on\nthe heart I worship. I go every evening to chat with the old woman, to\nhear from her all that Honorine has done during the day, the lightest\nword she has spoken, for a single exclamation might betray to me the\nsecrets of that soul which is wilfully deaf and dumb. Honorine is pious;\nshe attends the Church services and prays, but she has never been to\nconfession or taken the Communion; she foresees what a priest would\ntell her. She will not listen to the advice, to the injunction, that she\nshould return to me. This horror of me overwhelms me, dismays me, for I\nhave never done her the smallest harm. I have always been kind to her.\nGranting even that I may have been a little hasty when teaching her,\nthat my man's irony may have hurt her legitimate girlish pride, is\nthat a reason for persisting in a determination which only the most\nimplacable hatred could have inspired? Honorine has never told Madame\nGobain who she is; she keeps absolute silence as to her marriage, so\nthat the worthy and respectable woman can never speak a word in my\nfavor, for she is the only person in the house who knows my secret. The\nothers know nothing; they live under the awe caused by the name of the\nPrefect of Police, and their respect for the power of a Minister. Hence\nit is impossible for me to penetrate that heart; the citadel is mine,\nbut I cannot get into it. I have not a single means of action. An act of\nviolence would ruin me for ever.\n\n\"'How can I argue against reasons of which I know nothing? Should I\nwrite a letter, and have it copied by a public writer, and laid before\nHonorine? But that would be to run the risk of a third removal. The\nlast cost me fifty thousand francs. The purchase was made in the first\ninstance in the name of the secretary whom you succeeded. The unhappy\nman, who did not know how lightly I sleep, was detected by me in the act\nof opening a box in which I had put the private agreement; I coughed,\nand he was seized with a panic; next day I compelled him to sell the\nhouse to the man in whose name it now stands, and I turned him out.\n\n\"'If it were not that I feel all my noblest faculties as a man\nsatisfied, happy, expansive; if the part I am playing were not that of\ndivine fatherhood; if I did not drink in delight by every pore, there\nare moments when I should believe that I was a monomaniac. Sometimes\nat night I hear the jingling bells of madness. I dread the violent\ntransitions from a feeble hope, which sometimes shines and flashes up,\nto complete despair, falling as low as man can fall. A few days since I\nwas seriously considering the horrible end of the story of Lovelace and\nClarissa Harlowe, and saying to myself, if Honorine were the mother of a\nchild of mine, must she not necessarily return under her husband's roof?\n\n\"'And I have such complete faith in a happy future, that ten months\nago I bought and paid for one of the handsomest houses in the Faubourg\nSaint-Honore. If I win back Honorine, I will not allow her to see this\nhouse again, nor the room from which she fled. I mean to place my idol\nin a new temple, where she may feel that life is altogether new. That\nhouse is being made a marvel of elegance and taste. I have been told\nof a poet who, being almost mad with love for an actress, bought the\nhandsomest bed in Paris without knowing how the actress would reward his\npassion. Well, one of the coldest of lawyers, a man who is supposed to\nbe the gravest adviser of the Crown, was stirred to the depths of\nhis heart by that anecdote. The orator of the Legislative Chamber can\nunderstand the poet who fed his ideal on material possibilities. Three\ndays before the arrival of Maria Louisa, Napoleon flung himself on\nhis wedding bed at Compiegne. All stupendous passions have the same\nimpulses. I love as a poet--as an emperor!'\n\n\"As I heard the last words, I believed that Count Octave's fears were\nrealized; he had risen, and was walking up and down, and gesticulating,\nbut he stopped as if shocked by the vehemence of his own words.\n\n\"'I am very ridiculous,' he added, after a long pause, looking at me, as\nif craving a glance of pity.\n\n\"'No, monsieur, you are very unhappy.'\n\n\"'Ah yes!' said he, taking up the thread of his confidences. 'From the\nviolence of my speech you may, you must believe in the intensity of a\nphysical passion which for nine years has absorbed all my faculties; but\nthat is nothing in comparison with the worship I feel for the soul, the\nmind, the heart, all in that woman; the enchanting divinities in the\ntrain of Love, with whom we pass our life, and who form the daily poem\nof a fugitive delight. By a phenomenon of retrospection I see now the\ngraces of Honorine's mind and heart, to which I paid little heed in the\ntime of my happiness--like all who are happy. From day to day I have\nappreciated the extent of my loss, discovering the exquisite gifts of\nthat capricious and refractory young creature who has grown so strong\nand so proud under the heavy hand of poverty and the shock of the most\ncowardly desertion. And that heavenly blossom is fading in solitude and\nhiding!--Ah! The law of which we were speaking,' he went on with bitter\nirony, 'the law is a squad of gendarmes--my wife seized and dragged away\nby force! Would not that be to triumph over a corpse? Religion has no\nhold on her; she craves its poetry, she prays, but she does not listen\nto the commandments of the Church. I, for my part, have exhausted\neverything in the way of mercy, of kindness, of love; I am at my wits'\nend. Only one chance of victory is left to me; the cunning and patience\nwith which bird-catchers at last entrap the wariest birds, the swiftest,\nthe most capricious, and the rarest. Hence, Maurice, when M. de\nGrandville's indiscretion betrayed to you the secret of my life, I ended\nby regarding this incident as one of the decrees of fate, one of the\nutterances for which gamblers listen and pray in the midst of their\nmost impassioned play.... Have you enough affection for me to show me\nromantic devotion?'\n\n\"'I see what you are coming to, Monsieur le Comte,' said I, interrupting\nhim; 'I guess your purpose. Your first secretary tried to open your deed\nbox. I know the heart of your second--he might fall in love with your\nwife. And can you devote him to destruction by sending him into the\nfire? Can any one put his hand into a brazier without burning it?'\n\n\"'You are a foolish boy,' replied the Count. 'I will send you well\ngloved. It is no secretary of mine that will be lodged in the Rue\nSaint-Maur in the little garden-house which I have at his disposal. It\nis my distant cousin, Baron de l'Hostal, a lawyer high in office...\"\n\n\"After a moment of silent surprise, I heard the gate bell ring, and a\ncarriage came into the courtyard. Presently the footman announced Madame\nde Courteville and her daughter. The Count had a large family connection\non his mother's side. Madame de Courteville, his cousin, was the widow\nof a judge on the bench of the Seine division, who had left her a\ndaughter and no fortune whatever. What could a woman of nine-and-twenty\nbe in comparison with a young girl of twenty, as lovely as imagination\ncould wish for an ideal mistress?\n\n\"'Baron, and Master of Appeals, till you get something better, and this\nold house settled on her,--would not you have enough good reasons for\nnot falling in love with the Countess?' he said to me in a whisper, as\nhe took me by the hand and introduced me to Madame de Courteville and\nher daughter.\n\n\"I was dazzled, not so much by these advantages of which I had never\ndreamed, but by Amelie de Courteville, whose beauty was thrown into\nrelief by one of those well-chosen toilets which a mother can achieve\nfor a daughter when she wants to see her married.\n\n\"But I will not talk of myself,\" said the Consul after a pause.\n\n\"Three weeks later I went to live in the gardener's cottage, which\nhad been cleaned, repaired, and furnished with the celerity which is\nexplained by three words: Paris; French workmen; money! I was as much\nin love as the Count could possibly desire as a security. Would the\nprudence of a young man of five-and-twenty be equal to the part I was\nundertaking, involving a friend's happiness? To settle that matter, I\nmay confess that I counted very much on my uncle's advice; for I had\nbeen authorized by the Count to take him into confidence in any case\nwhere I deemed his interference necessary. I engaged a garden; I devoted\nmyself to horticulture; I worked frantically, like a man whom nothing\ncan divert, turning up the soil of the market-garden, and appropriating\nthe ground to the culture of flowers. Like the maniacs of England, or\nof Holland, I gave it out that I was devoted to one kind of flower, and\nespecially grew dahlias, collecting every variety. You will understand\nthat my conduct, even in the smallest details, was laid down for me by\nthe Count, whose whole intellectual powers were directed to the most\ntrifling incidents of the tragi-comedy enacted in the Rue Saint-Maur. As\nsoon as the Countess had gone to bed, at about eleven at night, Octave,\nMadame Gobain, and I sat in council. I heard the old woman's report to\nthe Count of his wife's least proceedings during the day. He inquired\ninto everything: her meals, her occupations, her frame of mind, her\nplans for the morrow, the flowers she proposed to imitate. I understood\nwhat love in despair may be when it is the threefold passion of the\nheart, the mind, and the senses. Octave lived only for that hour.\n\n\"During two months, while my work in the garden lasted, I never set\neyes on the little house where my fair neighbor dwelt. I had not even\ninquired whether I had a neighbor, though the Countess' garden was\ndivided from mine by a paling, along which she had planted cypress trees\nalready four feet high. One fine morning Madame Gobain announced to her\nmistress, as a disastrous piece of news, the intention, expressed by\nan eccentric creature who had become her neighbor, of building a wall\nbetween the two gardens, at the end of the year. I will say nothing of\nthe curiosity which consumed me to see the Countess! The wish almost\nextinguished my budding love for Amelie de Courteville. My scheme for\nbuilding a wall was indeed a dangerous threat. There would be no more\nfresh air for Honorine, whose garden would then be a sort of narrow\nalley shut in between my wall and her own little house. This dwelling,\nformerly a summer villa, was like a house of cards; it was not more\nthan thirty feet deep, and about a hundred feet long. The garden front,\npainted in the German fashion, imitated a trellis with flowers up to the\nsecond floor, and was really a charming example of the Pompadour style,\nso well called rococo. A long avenue of limes led up to it. The gardens\nof the pavilion and my plot of ground were in the shape of a hatchet, of\nwhich this avenue was the handle. My wall would cut away three-quarters\nof the hatchet.\n\n\"The Countess was in despair.\n\n\"'My good Gobain,' said she, 'what sort of man is this florist?'\n\n\"'On my word,' said the housekeeper, 'I do not know whether it will\nbe possible to tame him. He seems to have a horror of women. He is the\nnephew of a Paris cure. I have seen the uncle but once; a fine old man\nof sixty, very ugly, but very amiable. It is quite possible that this\npriest encourages his nephew, as they say in the neighborhood, in his\nlove of flowers, that nothing worse may happen----'\n\n\"'Why--what?'\n\n\"'Well, your neighbor is a little cracked!' said Gobain, tapping her\nhead!\n\n\"Now a harmless lunatic is the only man whom no woman ever distrusts\nin the matter of sentiment. You will see how wise the Count had been in\nchoosing this disguise for me.\n\n\"'What ails him then?' asked the Countess.\n\n\"'He has studied too hard,' replied Gobain; 'he has turned misanthropic.\nAnd he has his reasons for disliking women--well, if you want to know\nall that is said about him----'\n\n\"'Well,' said Honorine, 'madmen frighten me less than sane folks; I will\nspeak to him myself! Tell him that I beg him to come here. If I do not\nsucceed, I will send for the cure.'\n\n\"The day after this conversation, as I was walking along my graveled\npath, I caught sight of the half-opened curtains on the first floor of\nthe little house, and of a woman's face curiously peeping out. Madame\nGobain called me. I hastily glanced at the Countess' house, and by a\nrude shrug expressed, 'What do I care for your mistress!'\n\n\"'Madame,' said Gobain, called upon to give an account of her errand,\n'the madman bid me leave him in peace, saying that even a charcoal\nseller is master in his own premises, especially when he has no wife.'\n\n\"'He is perfectly right,' said the Countess.\n\n\"'Yes, but he ended by saying, \"I will go,\" when I told him that he\nwould greatly distress a lady living in retirement, who found her\ngreatest solace in growing flowers.'\n\n\"Next day a signal from Gobain informed me that I was expected. After\nthe Countess' breakfast, when she was walking to and fro in front of\nher house, I broke out some palings and went towards her. I had dressed\nmyself like a countryman, in an old pair of gray flannel trousers,\nheavy wooden shoes, and shabby shooting coat, a peaked cap on my head,\na ragged bandana round my neck, hands soiled with mould, and a dibble in\nmy hand.\n\n\"'Madame,' said the housekeeper, 'this good man is your neighbor.'\n\n\"The Countess was not alarmed. I saw at last the woman whom her own\nconduct and her husband's confidences had made me so curious to meet. It\nwas in the early days of May. The air was pure, the weather serene; the\nverdure of the first foliage, the fragrance of spring formed a setting\nfor this creature of sorrow. As I then saw Honorine I understood\nOctave's passion and the truthfulness of his description, 'A heavenly\nflower!'\n\n\"Her pallor was what first struck me by its peculiar tone of white--for\nthere are as many tones of white as of red or blue. On looking at the\nCountess, the eye seemed to feel that tender skin, where the blood\nflowed in the blue veins. At the slightest emotion the blood mounted\nunder the surface in rosy flushes like a cloud. When we met, the\nsunshine, filtering through the light foliage of the acacias, shed on\nHonorine the pale gold, ambient glory in which Raphael and Titian, alone\nof all painters, have been able to enwrap the Virgin. Her brown\neyes expressed both tenderness and vivacity; their brightness seemed\nreflected in her face through the long downcast lashes. Merely by\nlifting her delicate eyelids, Honorine could cast a spell; there was\nso much feeling, dignity, terror, or contempt in her way of raising or\ndropping those veils of the soul. She could freeze or give life by a\nlook. Her light-brown hair, carelessly knotted on her head, outlined\na poet's brow, high, powerful, and dreamy. The mouth was wholly\nvoluptuous. And to crown all by a grace, rare in France, though common\nin Italy, all the lines and forms of the head had a stamp of nobleness\nwhich would defy the outrages of time.\n\n\"Though slight, Honorine was not thin, and her figure struck me as\nbeing one that might revive love when it believed itself exhausted. She\nperfectly represented the idea conveyed by the word _mignonne_, for she\nwas one of those pliant little women who allow themselves to be taken\nup, petted, set down, and taken up again like a kitten. Her small feet,\nas I heard them on the gravel, made a light sound essentially their own,\nthat harmonized with the rustle of her dress, producing a feminine\nmusic which stamped itself on the heart, and remained distinct from the\nfootfall of a thousand other women. Her gait bore all the quarterings of\nher race with so much pride, that, in the street, the least respectful\nworking man would have made way for her. Gay and tender, haughty and\nimposing, it was impossible to understand her, excepting as gifted with\nthese apparently incompatible qualities, which, nevertheless, had left\nher still a child. But it was a child who might be as strong as an\nangel; and, like the angel, once hurt in her nature, she would be\nimplacable.\n\n\"Coldness on that face must no doubt be death to those on whom her eyes\nhad smiled, for whom her set lips had parted, for those whose soul had\ndrunk in the melody of that voice, lending to her words the poetry of\nsong by its peculiar intonation. Inhaling the perfume of violets that\naccompanied her, I understood how the memory of this wife had arrested\nthe Count on the threshold of debauchery, and how impossible it would be\never to forget a creature who really was a flower to the touch, a flower\nto the eye, a flower of fragrance, a heavenly flower to the soul....\nHonorine inspired devotion, chivalrous devotion, regardless of reward. A\nman on seeing her must say to himself:\n\n\"'Think, and I will divine your thought; speak, and I will obey. If my\nlife, sacrificed in torments, can procure you one day's happiness, take\nmy life, I will smile like a martyr at the stake, for I shall offer that\nday to God, as a token to which a father responds on recognizing a\ngift to his child.' Many women study their expression, and succeed in\nproducing effects similar to those which would have struck you at\nfirst sight of the Countess; only, in her, it was all the outcome of a\ndelightful nature, that inimitable nature went at once to the heart.\nIf I tell you all this, it is because her soul, her thoughts, the\nexquisiteness of her heart, are all we are concerned with, and you would\nhave blamed me if I had not sketched them for you.\n\n\"I was very near forgetting my part as a half-crazy lout, clumsy, and by\nno means chivalrous.\n\n\"'I am told, madame, that you are fond of flowers?'\n\n\"'I am an artificial flower-maker,' said she. 'After growing flowers, I\nimitate them, like a mother who is artist enough to have the pleasure of\npainting her children.... That is enough to tell you that I am poor and\nunable to pay for the concession I am anxious to obtain from you?'\n\n\"'But how,' said I, as grave as a judge, 'can a lady of such rank as\nyours would seem to be, ply so humble a calling? Have you, like me,\ngood reasons for employing your fingers so as to keep your brains from\nworking?'\n\n\"'Let us stick to the question of the wall,' said she, with a smile.\n\n\"'Why, we have begun at the foundations,' said I. 'Must not I know which\nof us ought to yield to the other in behalf of our suffering, or, if you\nchoose, of our mania?--Oh! what a charming clump of narcissus! They are\nas fresh as this spring morning!'\n\n\"I assure you, she had made for herself a perfect museum of flowers and\nshrubs, which none might see but the sun, and of which the arrangement\nhad been prompted by the genius of an artist; the most heartless of\nlandlords must have treated it with respect. The masses of plants,\narranged according to their height, or in single clumps, were really a\njoy to the soul. This retired and solitary garden breathed comforting\nscents, and suggested none but sweet thoughts and graceful, nay,\nvoluptuous pictures. On it was set that inscrutable sign-manual, which\nour true character stamps on everything, as soon as nothing compels us\nto obey the various hypocrisies, necessary as they are, which Society\ninsists on. I looked alternately at the mass of narcissus and at the\nCountess, affecting to be far more in love with the flowers than with\nher, to carry out my part.\n\n\"'So you are very fond of flowers?' said she.\n\n\"'They are,' I replied, 'the only beings that never disappoint our cares\nand affection.' And I went on to deliver such a diatribe while comparing\nbotany and the world, that we ended miles away from the dividing wall,\nand the Countess must have supposed me to be a wretched and wounded\nsufferer worthy of her pity. However, at the end of half an hour my\nneighbor naturally brought me back to the point; for women, when they\nare not in love, have all the cold blood of an experienced attorney.\n\n\"'If you insist on my leaving the paling,' said I, 'you will learn all\nthe secrets of gardening that I want to hide; I am seeking to grow a\nblue dahlia, a blue rose; I am crazy for blue flowers. Is not blue the\nfavorite color of superior souls? We are neither of us really at home;\nwe might as well make a little door of open railings to unite our\ngardens.... You, too, are fond of flowers; you will see mine, I shall\nsee yours. If you receive no visitors at all, I, for my part, have none\nbut my uncle, the Cure of the White Friars.'\n\n\"'No,' said she, 'I will give you the right to come into my garden, my\npremises at any hour. Come and welcome; you will always be admitted as a\nneighbor with whom I hope to keep on good terms. But I like my solitude\ntoo well to burden it with any loss of independence.'\n\n\"'As you please,' said I, and with one leap I was over the paling.\n\n\"'Now, of what use would a door be?' said I, from my own domain, turning\nround to the Countess, and mocking her with a madman's gesture and\ngrimace.\n\n\"For a fortnight I seemed to take no heed of my neighbor. Towards the\nend of May, one lovely evening, we happened both to be out on opposite\nsides of the paling, both walking slowly. Having reached the end, we\ncould not help exchanging a few civil words; she found me in such deep\ndejection, lost in such painful meditations, that she spoke to me of\nhopefulness, in brief sentences that sounded like the songs with which\nnurses lull their babies. I then leaped the fence, and found myself for\nthe second time at her side. The Countess led me into the house, wishing\nto subdue my sadness. So at last I had penetrated the sanctuary where\neverything was in harmony with the woman I have tried to describe to\nyou.\n\n\"Exquisite simplicity reigned there. The interior of the little house\nwas just such a dainty box as the art of the eighteenth century devised\nfor the pretty profligacy of a fine gentleman. The dining-room, on the\nground floor, was painted in fresco, with garlands of flowers, admirably\nand marvelously executed. The staircase was charmingly decorated in\nmonochrome. The little drawing-room, opposite the dining-room, was very\nmuch faded; but the Countess had hung it with panels of tapestry of\nfanciful designs, taken off old screens. A bath-room came next. Upstairs\nthere was but one bedroom, with a dressing-room, and a library which she\nused as her workroom. The kitchen was beneath in the basement on which\nthe house was raised, for there was a flight of several steps outside.\nThe balustrade of a balcony in garlands a la Pompadour concealed the\nroof; only the lead cornices were visible. In this retreat one was a\nhundred leagues from Paris.\n\n\"But for the bitter smile which occasionally played on the beautiful\nred lips of this pale woman, it would have been possible to believe that\nthis violet buried in her thicket of flowers was happy. In a few days\nwe had reached a certain degree of intimacy, the result of our close\nneighborhood and of the Countess' conviction that I was indifferent to\nwomen. A look would have spoilt all, and I never allowed a thought of\nher to be seen in my eyes. Honorine chose to regard me as an old friend.\nHer manner to me was the outcome of a kind of pity. Her looks, her\nvoice, her words, all showed that she was a hundred miles away from the\ncoquettish airs which the strictest virtue might have allowed under such\ncircumstances. She soon gave me the right to go into the pretty workshop\nwhere she made her flowers, a retreat full of books and curiosities, as\nsmart as a boudoir where elegance emphasized the vulgarity of the tools\nof her trade. The Countess had in the course of time poetized, as I may\nsay, a thing which is at the antipodes to poetry--a manufacture.\n\n\"Perhaps of all the work a woman can do, the making of artificial\nflowers is that of which the details allow her to display most grace.\nFor coloring prints she must sit bent over a table and devote herself,\nwith some attention, to this half painting. Embroidering tapestry, as\ndiligently as a woman must who is to earn her living by it, entails\nconsumption or curvature of the spine. Engraving music is one of the\nmost laborious, by the care, the minute exactitude, and the intelligence\nit demands. Sewing and white embroidery do not earn thirty sous a day.\nBut the making of flowers and light articles of wear necessitates a\nvariety of movements, gestures, ideas even, which do not take a pretty\nwoman out of her sphere; she is still herself; she may chat, laugh,\nsing, or think.\n\n\"There was certainly a feeling for art in the way in which the Countess\narranged on a long deal table the myriad-colored petals which were used\nin composing the flowers she was to produce. The saucers of color were\nof white china, and always clean, arranged in such order that the eye\ncould at once see the required shade in the scale of tints. Thus the\naristocratic artist saved time. A pretty little cabinet with a hundred\ntiny drawers, of ebony inlaid with ivory, contained the little steel\nmoulds in which she shaped the leaves and some forms of petals. A fine\nJapanese bowl held the paste, which was never allowed to turn sour, and\nit had a fitted cover with a hinge so easy that she could lift it with\na finger-tip. The wire, of iron and brass, lurked in a little drawer of\nthe table before her.\n\n\"Under her eyes, in a Venetian glass, shaped like a flower-cup on its\nstem, was the living model she strove to imitate. She had a passion for\nachievement; she attempted the most difficult things, close racemes,\nthe tiniest corollas, heaths, nectaries of the most variegated hues. Her\nhands, as swift as her thoughts, went from the table to the flower she\nwas making, as those of an accomplished pianist fly over the keys. Her\nfingers seemed to be fairies, to use Perrault's expression, so infinite\nwere the different actions of twisting, fitting, and pressure needed\nfor the work, all hidden under grace of movement, while she adapted each\nmotion to the result with the lucidity of instinct.\n\n\"I could not tire of admiring her as she shaped a flower from the\nmaterials sorted before her, padding the wire stem and adjusting the\nleaves. She displayed the genius of a painter in her bold attempts;\nshe copied faded flowers and yellowing leaves; she struggled even with\nwildflowers, the most artless of all, and the most elaborate in their\nsimplicity.\n\n\"'This art,' she would say, 'is in its infancy. If the women of Paris\nhad a little of the genius which the slavery of the harem brings out in\nOriental women, they would lend a complete language of flowers to the\nwreaths they wear on their head. To please my own taste as an artist I\nhave made drooping flowers with leaves of the hue of Florentine bronze,\nsuch as are found before or after the winter. Would not such a crown\non the head of a young woman whose life is a failure have a certain\npoetical fitness? How many things a woman might express by her\nhead-dress! Are there not flowers for drunken Bacchantes, flowers\nfor gloomy and stern bigots, pensive flowers for women who are bored?\nBotany, I believe, may be made to express every sensation and thought of\nthe soul, even the most subtle.'\n\n\"She would employ me to stamp out the leaves, cut up material, and\nprepare wires for the stems. My affected desire for occupation made me\nsoon skilful. We talked as we worked. When I had nothing to do, I read\nnew books to her, for I had my part to keep up as a man weary of life,\nworn out with griefs, gloomy, sceptical, and soured. My person led to\nadorable banter as to my purely physical resemblance--with the exception\nof his club foot--to Lord Byron. It was tacitly acknowledged that\nher own troubles, as to which she kept the most profound silence, far\noutweighed mine, though the causes I assigned for my misanthropy might\nhave satisfied Young or Job.\n\n\"I will say nothing of the feelings of shame which tormented me as I\ninflicted on my heart, like the beggars in the street, false wounds to\nexcite the compassion of that enchanting woman. I soon appreciated the\nextent of my devotedness by learning to estimate the baseness of a spy.\nThe expressions of sympathy bestowed on me would have comforted the\ngreatest grief. This charming creature, weaned from the world, and for\nso many years alone, having, besides love, treasures of kindliness\nto bestow, offered these to me with childlike effusiveness and\nsuch compassion as would inevitably have filled with bitterness any\nprofligate who should have fallen in love with her; for, alas, it was\nall charity, all sheer pity. Her renunciation of love, her dread of what\nis called happiness for women, she proclaimed with equal vehemence and\ncandor. These happy days proved to me that a woman's friendship is far\nsuperior to her love.\n\n\"I suffered the revelations of my sorrows to be dragged from me with as\nmany grimaces as a young lady allows herself before sitting down to the\npiano, so conscious are they of the annoyance that will follow. As\nyou may imagine, the necessity for overcoming my dislike to speak had\ninduced the Countess to strengthen the bonds of our intimacy; but she\nfound in me so exact a counterpart of her own antipathy to love, that\nI fancied she was well content with the chance which had brought to her\ndesert island a sort of Man Friday. Solitude was perhaps beginning to\nweigh on her. At the same time, there was nothing of the coquette in\nher; nothing survived of the woman; she did not feel that she had a\nheart, she told me, excepting in the ideal world where she found refuge.\nI involuntarily compared these two lives--hers and the Count's:--his,\nall activity, agitation, and emotion; hers, all inaction, quiescence,\nand stagnation. The woman and the man were admirably obedient to their\nnature. My misanthropy allowed me to utter cynical sallies against men\nand women both, and I indulged in them, hoping to bring Honorine to\nthe confidential point; but she was not to be caught in any trap, and I\nbegan to understand that mulish obstinacy which is commoner among women\nthan is generally supposed.\n\n\"'The Orientals are right,' I said to her one evening, 'when they shut\nyou up and regard you merely as the playthings of their pleasure. Europe\nhas been well punished for having admitted you to form an element of\nsociety and for accepting you on an equal footing. In my opinion, woman\nis the most dishonorable and cowardly being to be found. Nay, and that\nis where her charm lies. Where would be the pleasure of hunting a tame\nthing? When once a woman has inspired a man's passion, she is to him\nfor ever sacred; in his eyes she is hedged round by an imprescriptible\nprerogative. In men gratitude for past delights is eternal. Though he\nshould find his mistress grown old or unworthy, the woman still has\nrights over his heart; but to you women the man you have loved is as\nnothing to you; nay, more, he is unpardonable in one thing--he lives on!\nYou dare not own it, but you all have in your hearts the feeling which\nthat popular calumny called tradition ascribes to the Lady of the Tour\nde Nesle: \"What a pity it is that we cannot live on love as we live on\nfruit, and that when we have had our fill, nothing should survive but\nthe remembrance of pleasure!\"'\n\n\"'God has, no doubt, reserved such perfect bliss for Paradise,' said\nshe. 'But,' she added, 'if your argument seems to you very witty, to me\nit has the disadvantage of being false. What can those women be who give\nthemselves up to a succession of loves?' she asked, looking at me as the\nVirgin in Ingres' picture looks at Louis XIII. offering her his kingdom.\n\n\"'You are an actress in good faith,' said I, 'for you gave me a look\njust now which would make the fame of an actress. Still, lovely as you\nare, you have loved; _ergo_, you forget.'\n\n\"'I!' she exclaimed, evading my question, 'I am not a woman. I am a nun,\nand seventy-two years old!'\n\n\"'Then, how can you so positively assert that you feel more keenly than\nI? Sorrow has but one form for women. The only misfortunes they regard\nare disappointments of the heart.'\n\n\"She looked at me sweetly, and, like all women when stuck between the\nissues of a dilemma, or held in the clutches of truth, she persisted,\nnevertheless, in her wilfulness.\n\n\"'I am a nun,' she said, 'and you talk to me of the world where I shall\nnever again set foot.'\n\n\"'Not even in thought?' said I.\n\n\"'Is the world so much to be desired?' she replied. 'Oh! when my mind\nwanders, it goes higher. The angel of perfection, the beautiful angel\nGabriel, often sings in my heart. If I were rich, I should work, all the\nsame, to keep me from soaring too often on the many-tinted wings of the\nangel, and wandering in the world of fancy. There are meditations which\nare the ruin of us women! I owe much peace of mind to my flowers, though\nsometimes they fail to occupy me. On some days I find my soul invaded\nby a purposeless expectancy; I cannot banish some idea which takes\npossession of me, which seems to make my fingers clumsy. I feel that\nsome great event is impending, that my life is about to change; I listen\nvaguely, I stare into the darkness, I have no liking for my work, and\nafter a thousand fatigues I find life once more--everyday life. Is this\na warning from heaven? I ask myself----'\n\n\"After three months of this struggle between two diplomates, concealed\nunder the semblance of youthful melancholy, and a woman whose disgust of\nlife made her invulnerable, I told the Count that it was impossible\nto drag this tortoise out of her shell; it must be broken. The evening\nbefore, in our last quite friendly discussion, the Countess had\nexclaimed:\n\n\"'Lucretia's dagger wrote in letters of blood the watchword of woman's\ncharter: _Liberty!_'\n\n\"From that moment the Count left me free to act.\n\n\"'I have been paid a hundred francs for the flowers and caps I made this\nweek!' Honorine exclaimed gleefully one Saturday evening when I went\nto visit her in the little sitting-room on the ground floor, which the\nunavowed proprietor had had regilt.\n\n\"It was ten o'clock. The twilight of July and a glorious moon lent\nus their misty light. Gusts of mingled perfumes soothed the soul; the\nCountess was clinking in her hand the five gold pieces given to her by\na supposititious dealer in fashionable frippery, another of Octave's\naccomplices found for him by a judge, M. Popinot.\n\n\"'I earn my living by amusing myself,' said she; 'I am free, when\nmen, armed with their laws, have tried to make us slaves. Oh, I have\ntransports of pride every Saturday! In short, I like M. Gaudissart's\ngold pieces as much as Lord Byron, your double, liked Mr. Murray's.'\n\n\"'This is not becoming in a woman,' said I.\n\n\"'Pooh! Am I a woman? I am a boy gifted with a soft soul, that is all; a\nboy whom no woman can torture----'\n\n\"'Your life is the negation of your whole being,' I replied. 'What? You,\non whom God has lavished His choicest treasures of love and beauty, do\nyou never wish----'\n\n\"'For what?' said she, somewhat disturbed by a speech which, for the\nfirst time, gave the lie to the part I had assumed.\n\n\"'For a pretty little child, with curling hair, running, playing among\nthe flowers, like a flower itself of life and love, and calling you\nmother!'\n\n\"I waited for an answer. A too prolonged silence led me to perceive the\nterrible effect of my words, though the darkness at first concealed it.\nLeaning on her sofa, the Countess had not indeed fainted, but frozen\nunder a nervous attack of which the first chill, as gentle as everything\nthat was part of her, felt, as she afterwards said, like the influence\nof a most insidious poison. I called Madame Gobain, who came and led\naway her mistress, laid her on her bed, unlaced her, undressed her, and\nrestored her, not to life, it is true, but to the consciousness of some\ndreadful suffering. I meanwhile walked up and down the path behind the\nhouse, weeping, and doubting my success. I only wished to give up this\npart of the bird-catcher which I had so rashly assumed. Madame Gobain,\nwho came down and found me with my face wet with tears, hastily went up\nagain to say to the Countess:\n\n\"'What has happened, madame? Monsieur Maurice is crying like a child.'\n\n\"Roused to action by the evil interpretation that might be put on our\nmutual behavior, she summoned superhuman strength to put on a wrapper\nand come down to me.\n\n\"'You are not the cause of this attack,' said she. 'I am subject to\nthese spasms, a sort of cramp of the heart----'\n\n\"'And will you not tell me of your troubles?' said I, in a voice which\ncannot be affected, as I wiped away my tears. 'Have you not just now\ntold me that you have been a mother, and have been so unhappy as to lose\nyour child?'\n\n\"'Marie!' she called as she rang the bell. Gobain came in.\n\n\"'Bring lights and some tea,' said she, with the calm decision of a\nMylady clothed in the armor of pride by the dreadful English training\nwhich you know too well.\n\n\"When the housekeeper had lighted the tapers and closed the shutters,\nthe Countess showed me a mute countenance; her indomitable pride and\ngravity, worthy of a savage, had already reasserted their mastery. She\nsaid:\n\n\"'Do you know why I like Lord Byron so much? It is because he suffered\nas animals do. Of what use are complaints when they are not an elegy\nlike Manfred's, nor bitter mockery like Don Juan's, nor a reverie like\nChilde Harold's? Nothing shall be known of me. My heart is a poem that I\nlay before God.'\n\n\"'If I chose----' said I.\n\n\"'If?' she repeated.\n\n\"'I have no interest in anything,' I replied, 'so I cannot be\ninquisitive; but, if I chose, I could know all your secrets by\nto-morrow.'\n\n\"'I defy you!' she exclaimed, with ill-disguised uneasiness.\n\n\"'Seriously?'\n\n\"'Certainly,' said she, tossing her head. 'If such a crime is possible,\nI ought to know it.'\n\n\"'In the first place, madame,' I went on, pointing to her hands,\n'those pretty fingers, which are enough to show that you are not a mere\ngirl--were they made for toil? Then you call yourself Madame Gobain,\nyou, who, in my presence the other day on receiving a letter, said to\nMarie: \"Here, this is for you?\" Marie is the real Madame Gobain; so\nyou conceal your name behind that of your housekeeper.--Fear nothing,\nmadame, from me. You have in me the most devoted friend you will ever\nhave: Friend, do you understand me? I give this word its sacred and\npathetic meaning, so profaned in France, where we apply it to our\nenemies. And your friend, who will defend you against everything, only\nwishes that you should be as happy as such a woman ought to be. Who\ncan tell whether the pain I have involuntarily caused you was not a\nvoluntary act?'\n\n\"'Yes,' replied she with threatening audacity, 'I insist on it. Be\ncurious, and tell me all that you can find out about me; but,' and she\nheld up her finger, 'you must also tell me by what means you obtain\nyour information. The preservation of the small happiness I enjoy here\ndepends on the steps you take.'\n\n\"'That means that you will fly----'\n\n\"'On wings!' she cried, 'to the New World----'\n\n\"'Where you will be at the mercy of the brutal passions you will\ninspire,' said I, interrupting her. 'Is it not the very essence of\ngenius and beauty to shine, to attract men's gaze, to excite desires and\nevil thoughts? Paris is a desert with Bedouins; Paris is the only place\nin the world where those who must work for their livelihood can hide\ntheir life. What have you to complain of? Who am I? An additional\nservant--M. Gobain, that is all. If you have to fight a duel, you may\nneed a second.'\n\n\"'Never mind; find out who I am. I have already said that I insist. Now,\nI beg that you will,' she went on, with the grace which you ladies have\nat command,\" said the Consul, looking at the ladies.\n\n\"'Well, then, to-morrow, at the same hour, I will tell you what I may\nhave discovered,' replied I. 'But do not therefore hate me! Will you\nbehave like other women?'\n\n\"'What do other women do?'\n\n\"'They lay upon us immense sacrifices, and when we have made them, they\nreproach us for it some time later as if it were an injury.'\n\n\"'They are right if the thing required appears to be a sacrifice!'\nreplied she pointedly.\n\n\"'Instead of sacrifices, say efforts and----'\n\n\"'It would be an impertinence,' said she.\n\n\"'Forgive me,' said I. 'I forget that woman and the Pope are\ninfallible.'\n\n\"'Good heavens!' said she after a long pause, 'only two words would be\nenough to destroy the peace so dearly bought, and which I enjoy like a\nfraud----'\n\n\"She rose and paid no further heed to me.\n\n\"'Where can I go?' she said. 'What is to become of me?--Must I leave\nthis quiet retreat, that I had arranged with such care to end my days\nin?'\n\n\"'To end your days!' exclaimed I with visible alarm. 'Has it never\nstruck you that a time would come when you could no longer work,\nwhen competition will lower the price of flowers and articles of\nfashion----?'\n\n\"'I have already saved a thousand crowns,' she said.\n\n\"'Heavens! what privations such a sum must represent!' I exclaimed.\n\n\"'Leave me,' said she, 'till to-morrow. This evening I am not myself; I\nmust be alone. Must I not save my strength in case of disaster? For,\nif you should learn anything, others besides you would be informed, and\nthen--Good-night,' she added shortly, dismissing me with an imperious\ngesture.\n\n\"'The battle is to-morrow, then,' I replied with a smile, to keep up the\nappearance of indifference I had given to the scene. But as I went down\nthe avenue I repeated the words:\n\n\"'The battle is to-morrow.'\n\n\"Octave's anxiety was equal to Honorine's. The Count and I remained\ntogether till two in the morning, walking to and fro by the trenches of\nthe Bastille, like two generals who, on the eve of a battle, calculate\nall the chances, examine the ground, and perceive that the victory must\ndepend on an opportunity to be seized half-way through the fight. These\ntwo divided beings would each lie awake, one in the hope, the other\nin agonizing dread of reunion. The real dramas of life are not in\ncircumstances, but in feelings; they are played in the heart, or, if you\nplease, in that vast realm which we ought to call the Spiritual World.\nOctave and Honorine moved and lived altogether in the world of lofty\nspirits.\n\n\"I was punctual. At ten next evening I was, for the first time, shown\ninto a charming bedroom furnished with white and blue--the nest of this\nwounded dove. The Countess looked at me, and was about to speak, but was\nstricken dumb by my respectful demeanor.\n\n\"'Madame la Comtesse,' said I with a grave smile.\n\n\"The poor woman, who had risen, dropped back into her chair and remained\nthere, sunk in an attitude of grief, which I should have liked to see\nperpetuated by a great painter.\n\n\"'You are,' I went on, 'the wife of the noblest and most highly\nrespected of men; of a man who is acknowledged to be great, but who is\nfar greater in his conduct to you than he is in the eyes of the world.\nYou and he are two lofty natures.--Where do you suppose yourself to be\nliving?' I asked her.\n\n\"'In my own house,' she replied, opening her eyes with a wide stare of\nastonishment.\n\n\"'In Count Octave's,' I replied. 'You have been tricked. M. Lenormand,\nthe usher of the Court, is not the real owner; he is only a screen for\nyour husband. The delightful seclusion you enjoy is the Count's work,\nthe money you earn is paid by him, and his protection extends to the\nmost trivial details of your existence. Your husband has saved you\nin the eyes of the world; he has assigned plausible reasons for your\ndisappearance; he professes to hope that you were not lost in the wreck\nof the _Cecile_, the ship in which you sailed for Havana to secure the\nfortune to be left to you by an old aunt, who might have forgotten\nyou; you embarked, escorted by two ladies of her family and an old\nman-servant. The Count says that he has sent agents to various spots,\nand received letters which give him great hopes. He takes as many\nprecautions to hide you from all eyes as you take yourself. In short, he\nobeys you...'\n\n\"'That is enough,' she said. 'I want to know but one thing more. From\nwhom have you obtained all these details?'\n\n\"'Well, madame, my uncle got a place for a penniless youth as secretary\nto the Commissary of police in this part of Paris. That young man told\nme everything. If you leave this house this evening, however stealthily,\nyour husband will know where you are gone, and his care will follow\nyou everywhere.--How could a woman so clever as you are believe that\nshopkeepers buy flowers and caps as dear as they sell them? Ask\na thousand crowns for a bouquet, and you will get it. No mother's\ntenderness was ever more ingenious than your husband's! I have learned\nfrom the porter of this house that the Count often comes behind the\nfence when all are asleep, to see the glimmer of your nightlight! Your\nlarge cashmere shawl cost six thousand francs--your old-clothes-seller\nbrings you, as second hand, things fresh from the best makers. In short,\nyou are living here like Venus in the toils of Vulcan; but you are alone\nin your prison by the devices of a sublime magnanimity, sublime for\nseven years past, and at every hour.'\n\n\"The Countess was trembling as a trapped swallow trembles while, as you\nhold it in your hand, it strains its neck to look about it with wild\neyes. She shook with a nervous spasm, studying me with a defiant look.\nHer dry eyes glittered with a light that was almost hot: still, she\nwas a woman! The moment came when her tears forced their way, and she\nwept--not because she was touched, but because she was helpless; they\nwere tears of desperation. She had believed herself independent and\nfree; marriage weighed on her as the prison cell does on the captive.\n\n\"'I will go!' she cried through her tears. 'He forces me to it; I will\ngo where no one certainly will come after me.'\n\n\"'What,' I said, 'you would kill yourself?--Madame, you must have some\nvery powerful reasons for not wishing to return to Comte Octave.'\n\n\"'Certainly I have!'\n\n\"'Well, then, tell them to me; tell them to my uncle. In us you will\nfind two devoted advisers. Though in the confessional my uncle is a\npriest, he never is one in a drawing-room. We will hear you; we will try\nto find a solution of the problems you may lay before us; and if you are\nthe dupe or the victim of some misapprehension, perhaps we can clear the\nmatter up. Your soul, I believe, is pure; but if you have done wrong,\nyour fault is fully expiated.... At any rate, remember that in me you\nhave a most sincere friend. If you should wish to evade the Count's\ntyranny, I will find you the means; he shall never find you.'\n\n\"'Oh! there is always a convent!' said she.\n\n\"'Yes. But the Count, as Minister of State, can procure your rejection\nby every convent in the world. Even though he is powerful, I will save\nyou from him--; but--only when you have demonstrated to me that you\ncannot and ought not to return to him. Oh! do not fear that you would\nescape his power only to fall into mine,' I added, noticing a glance of\nhorrible suspicion, full of exaggerated dignity. 'You shall have peace,\nsolitude, and independence; in short, you shall be as free and as little\nannoyed as if you were an ugly, cross old maid. I myself would never be\nable to see you without your consent.'\n\n\"'And how? By what means?'\n\n\"'That is my secret. I am not deceiving you, of that you may be\nsure. Prove to me that this is the only life you can lead, that it is\npreferable to that of the Comtesse Octave, rich, admired, in one of the\nfinest houses in Paris, beloved by her husband, a happy mother... and I\nwill decide in your favor.'\n\n\"'But,' said she, 'will there never be a man who understands me?'\n\n\"'No. And that is why I appeal to religion to decide between us. The\nCure of the White Friars is a saint, seventy-five years of age. My uncle\nis not a Grand Inquisitor, he is Saint John; but for you he will be\nFenelon--the Fenelon who said to the Duc de Bourgogne: 'Eat a calf on a\nFriday by all means, monseigneur. But be a Christian.'\n\n\"'Nay, nay, monsieur, the convent is my last hope and my only refuge.\nThere is none but God who can understand me. No man, not Saint Augustine\nhimself, the tenderest of the Fathers of the Church, could enter into\nthe scruples of my conscience, which are to me as the circles of Dante's\nhell, whence there is no escape. Another than my husband, a different\nman, however unworthy of the offering, has had all my love. No, he has\nnot had it, for he did not take it; I gave it him as a mother gives her\nchild a wonderful toy, which it breaks. For me there never could be two\nloves. In some natures love can never be on trial; it is, or it is not.\nWhen it comes, when it rises up, it is complete.--Well, that life of\neighteen months was to me a life of eighteen years; I threw into it\nall the faculties of my being, which were not impoverished by their\neffusiveness; they were exhausted by that delusive intimacy in which\nI alone was genuine. For me the cup of happiness is not drained, nor\nempty; and nothing can refill it, for it is broken. I am out of the\nfray; I have no weapons left. Having thus utterly abandoned myself,\nwhat am I?--the leavings of a feast. I had but one name bestowed on\nme, Honorine, as I had but one heart. My husband had the young girl, a\nworthless lover had the woman--there is nothing left!--Then let myself\nbe loved! that is the great idea you mean to utter to me. Oh! but I\nstill am something, and I rebel at the idea of being a prostitute! Yes,\nby the light of the conflagration I saw clearly; and I tell you--well, I\ncould imagine surrendering to another man's love, but to Octave's?--No,\nnever.'\n\n\"'Ah! you love him,' I said.\n\n\"'I esteem him, respect him, venerate him; he never has done me the\nsmallest hurt; he is kind, he is tender; but I can never more love him.\nHowever,' she went on, 'let us talk no more of this. Discussion makes\neverything small. I will express my notions on this subject in writing\nto you, for at this moment they are suffocating me; I am feverish, my\nfeet are standing in the ashes of my Paraclete. All that I see, these\nthings which I believed I had earned by my labor, now remind me of\neverything I wish to forget. Ah! I must fly from hence as I fled from my\nhome.'\n\n\"'Where will you go?' I asked. 'Can a woman exist unprotected? At\nthirty, in all the glory of your beauty, rich in powers of which you\nhave no suspicion, full of tenderness to be bestowed, are you prepared\nto live in the wilderness where I could hide you?--Be quite easy. The\nCount, who for nine years has never allowed himself to be seen here,\nwill never go there without your permission. You have his sublime\ndevotion of nine years as a guarantee for your tranquillity. You may\ntherefore discuss the future in perfect confidence with my uncle and\nme. My uncle has as much influence as a Minister of State. So compose\nyourself; do not exaggerate your misfortune. A priest whose hair has\ngrown white in the exercise of his functions is not a boy; you will be\nunderstood by him to whom every passion has been confided for nearly\nfifty years now, and who weighs in his hands the ponderous heart of\nkings and princes. If he is stern under his stole, in the presence of\nyour flowers he will be as tender as they are, and as indulgent as his\nDivine Master.'\n\n\"I left the Countess at midnight; she was apparently calm, but\ndepressed, and had some secret purpose which no perspicacity could\nguess. I found the Count a few paces off, in the Rue Saint-Maur. Drawn\nby an irresistible attraction, he had quitted the spot on the Boulevards\nwhere we had agreed to meet.\n\n\"'What a night my poor child will go through!' he exclaimed, when I had\nfinished my account of the scene that had just taken place. 'Supposing I\nwere to go to her!' he added; 'supposing she were to see me suddenly?'\n\n\"'At this moment she is capable of throwing herself out of the window,'\nI replied. 'The Countess is one of those Lucretias who could not survive\nany violence, even if it were done by a man into whose arms she could\nthrow herself.'\n\n\"'You are young,' he answered; 'you do not know that in a soul tossed by\nsuch dreadful alternatives the will is like waters of a lake lashed by a\ntempest; the wind changes every instant, and the waves are driven now to\none shore, now to the other. During this night the chances are quite\nas great that on seeing me Honorine might rush into my arms as that she\nwould throw herself out of the window.'\n\n\"'And you would accept the equal chances,' said I.\n\n\"'Well, come,' said he, 'I have at home, to enable me to wait till\nto-morrow, a dose of opium which Desplein prepared for me to send me to\nsleep without any risk!'\n\n\"Next day at noon Gobain brought me a letter, telling me that the\nCountess had gone to bed at six, worn out with fatigue, and that, having\ntaken a soothing draught prepared by the chemist, she had now fallen\nasleep.\n\n\"This is her letter, of which I kept a copy--for you, mademoiselle,\"\nsaid the Consul, addressing Camille, \"know all the resources of art, the\ntricks of style, and the efforts made in their compositions by writers\nwho do not lack skill; but you will acknowledge that literature could\nnever find such language in its assumed pathos; there is nothing so\nterrible as truth. Here is the letter written by this woman, or rather\nby this anguish:--\n\n\"'MONSIEUR MAURICE,--\n\n\"'I know all your uncle would say to me; he is not better informed than\nmy own conscience. Conscience is the interpreter of God to man. I know\nthat if I am not reconciled to Octave, I shall be damned; that is the\nsentence of religious law. Civil law condemns me to obey, cost what it\nmay. If my husband does not reject me, the world will regard me as pure,\nas virtuous, whatever I may have done. Yes, that much is sublime in\nmarriage; society ratifies the husband's forgiveness; but it forgets\nthat the forgiveness must be accepted. Legally, religiously, and from\nthe world's point of view I ought to go back to Octave. Keeping only\nto the human aspect of the question, is it not cruel to refuse him\nhappiness, to deprive him of children, to wipe his name out of the\nGolden Book and the list of peers? My sufferings, my repugnance, my\nfeelings, all my egoism--for I know that I am an egoist--ought to be\nsacrificed to the family. I shall be a mother; the caresses of my child\nwill wipe away many tears! I shall be very happy; I certainly shall\nbe much looked up to. I shall ride, haughty and wealthy, in a handsome\ncarriage! I shall have servants and a fine house, and be the queen of as\nmany parties as there are weeks in the year. The world will receive\nme handsomely. I shall not have to climb up again to the heaven of\naristocracy, I shall never have come down from it. So God, the law,\nsociety are all in accord.\n\n\"'\"What are you rebelling against?\" I am asked from the height of\nheaven, from the pulpit, from the judge's bench, and from the throne,\nwhose august intervention may at need be invoked by the Count. Your\nuncle, indeed, at need, would speak to me of a certain celestial grace\nwhich will flood my heart when I know the pleasure of doing my duty.\n\n\"'God, the law, the world, and Octave all wish me to live, no doubt.\nWell, if there is no other difficulty, my reply cuts the knot: I will\nnot live. I will become white and innocent again; for I will lie in my\nshroud, white with the blameless pallor of death. This is not in the\nleast \"mulish obstinacy.\" That mulish obstinacy of which you jestingly\naccused me is in a woman the result of confidence, of a vision of the\nfuture. Though my husband, sublimely generous, may forget all, I\nshall not forget. Does forgetfulness depend on our will? When a widow\nre-marries, love makes a girl of her; she marries a man she loves. But I\ncannot love the Count. It all lies in that, do not you see?\n\n\"'Every time my eyes met his I should see my sin in them, even when his\nwere full of love. The greatness of his generosity would be the measure\nof the greatness of my crime. My eyes, always uneasy, would be for ever\nreading an invisible condemnation. My heart would be full of confused\nand struggling memories; marriage can never move me to the cruel\nrapture, the mortal delirium of passion. I should kill my husband by\nmy coldness, by comparisons which he would guess, though hidden in the\ndepths of my conscience. Oh! on the day when I should read a trace of\ninvoluntary, even of suppressed reproach in a furrow on his brow, in a\nsaddened look, in some imperceptible gesture, nothing could hold me: I\nshould be lying with a fractured skull on the pavement, and find that\nless hard than my husband. It might be my own over-susceptibility that\nwould lead me to this horrible but welcome death; I might die the victim\nof an impatient mood in Octave caused by some matter of business, or be\ndeceived by some unjust suspicion. Alas! I might even mistake some proof\nof love for a sign of contempt!\n\n\"'What torture on both sides! Octave would be always doubting me, I\ndoubting him. I, quite involuntarily, should give him a rival wholly\nunworthy of him, a man whom I despise, but with whom I have known\nraptures branded on me with fire, which are my shame, but which I cannot\nforget.\n\n\"'Have I shown you enough of my heart? No one, monsieur, can convince\nme that love may be renewed, for I neither can nor will accept love from\nany one. A young bride is like a plucked flower; but a guilty wife is\nlike a flower that had been walked over. You, who are a florist, you\nknow whether it is ever possible to restore the broken stem, to revive\nthe faded colors, to make the sap flow again in the tender vessels of\nwhich the whole vegetative function lies in their perfect rigidity. If\nsome botanist should attempt the operation, could his genius smooth out\nthe folds of the bruised corolla? If he could remake a flower, he\nwould be God! God alone can remake me! I am drinking the bitter cup\nof expiation; but as I drink it I painfully spell out this sentence:\nExpiation is not annihilation.\n\n\"'In my little house, alone, I eat my bread soaked in tears; but no one\nsees me eat nor sees me weep. If I go back to Octave, I must give up\nmy tears--they would offend him. Oh! monsieur, how many virtues must a\nwoman tread under foot, not to give herself, but to restore herself to a\nbetrayed husband? Who could count them? God alone; for He alone can know\nand encourage the horrible refinements at which the angels must turn\npale. Nay, I will go further. A woman has courage in the presence of her\nhusband if he knows nothing; she shows a sort of fierce strength in her\nhypocrisy; she deceives him to secure him double happiness. But common\nknowledge is surely degrading. Supposing I could exchange humiliation\nfor ecstasy? Would not Octave at last feel that my consent was sheer\ndepravity? Marriage is based on esteem, on sacrifices on both sides; but\nneither Octave nor I could esteem each other the day after our reunion.\nHe would have disgraced me by a love like that of an old man for a\ncourtesan, and I should for ever feel the shame of being a chattel\ninstead of a lady. I should represent pleasure, and not virtue, in his\nhouse. These are the bitter fruits of such a sin. I have made myself a\nbed where I can only toss on burning coals, a sleepless pillow.\n\n\"'Here, when I suffer, I bless my sufferings; I say to God, \"I thank\nThee!\" But in my husband's house I should be full of terror, tasting\njoys to which I have no right.\n\n\"'All this, monsieur, is not argument; it is the feeling of a soul made\nvast and hollow by seven years of suffering. Finally, must I make a\nhorrible confession? I shall always feel at my bosom the lips of a child\nconceived in rapture and joy, and in the belief in happiness, of a child\nI nursed for seven months, that I shall bear in my womb all the days of\nmy life. If other children should draw their nourishment from me, they\nwould drink in tears mingling with the milk, and turning it sour. I\nseem a light thing, you regard me as a child--Ah yes! I have a child's\nmemory, the memory which returns to us on the verge of the tomb. So, you\nsee, there is not a situation in that beautiful life to which the world\nand my husband's love want to recall me, which is not a false position,\nwhich does not cover a snare or reveal a precipice down which I must\nfall, torn by pitiless rocks. For five years now I have been wandering\nin the sandy desert of the future without finding a place convenient to\nrepent in, because my soul is possessed by true repentance.\n\n\"'Religion has its answers ready to all this, and I know them by heart.\nThis suffering, these difficulties, are my punishment, she says, and God\nwill give me strength to endure them. This, monsieur, is an argument to\ncertain pious souls gifted with an energy which I have not. I have made\nmy choice between this hell, where God does not forbid my blessing Him,\nand the hell that awaits me under Count Octave's roof.\n\n\"'One word more. If I were still a girl, with the experience I now have,\nmy husband is the man I should choose; but that is the very reason of\nmy refusal. I could not bear to blush before that man. What! I should\nbe always on my knees, he always standing upright; and if we were to\nexchange positions, I should scorn him! I will not be better treated\nby him in consequence of my sin. The angel who might venture under such\ncircumstances on certain liberties which are permissible when both are\nequally blameless, is not on earth; he dwells in heaven! Octave is\nfull of delicate feeling, I know; but even in his soul (which, however\ngenerous, is a man's soul after all) there is no guarantee for the new\nlife I should lead with him.\n\n\"'Come then, and tell me where I may find the solitude, the peace, the\nsilence, so kindly to irreparable woes, which you promised me.'\n\n\"After making this copy of the letter to preserve it complete, I went\nto the Rue Payenne. Anxiety had conquered the power of opium. Octave was\nwalking up and down his garden like a madman.\n\n\"'Answer that!' said I, giving him his wife's letter. 'Try to reassure\nthe modesty of experience. It is rather more difficult than conquering\nthe modesty of ignorance, which curiosity helps to betray.'\n\n\"'She is mine!' cried the Count, whose face expressed joy as he went on\nreading the letter.\n\n\"He signed to me with his hand to leave him to himself. I understood\nthat extreme happiness and extreme pain obey the same laws; I went in\nto receive Madame de Courteville and Amelie, who were to dine with the\nCount that day. However handsome Mademoiselle de Courteville might be, I\nfelt, on seeing her once more, that love has three aspects, and that\nthe women who can inspire us with perfect love are very rare. As I\ninvoluntarily compared Amelie with Honorine, I found the erring wife\nmore attractive than the pure girl. To Honorine's heart fidelity had not\nbeen a duty, but the inevitable; while Amelie would serenely pronounce\nthe most solemn promises without knowing their purport or to what they\nbound her. The crushed, the dead woman, so to speak, the sinner to be\nreinstated, seemed to me sublime; she incited the special generosities\nof a man's nature; she demanded all the treasures of the heart, all\nthe resources of strength; she filled his life and gave the zest of\na conflict to happiness; whereas Amelie, chaste and confiding,\nwould settle down into the sphere of peaceful motherhood, where the\ncommonplace must be its poetry, and where my mind would find no struggle\nand no victory.\n\n\"Of the plains of Champagne and the snowy, storm-beaten but sublime\nAlps, what young man would choose the chalky, monotonous level? No; such\ncomparisons are fatal and wrong on the threshold of the Mairie. Alas!\nonly the experience of life can teach us that marriage excludes passion,\nthat a family cannot have its foundation on the tempests of love. After\nhaving dreamed of impossible love, with its infinite caprices, after\nhaving tasted the tormenting delights of the ideal, I saw before me\nmodest reality. Pity me, for what could be expected! At five-and-twenty\nI did not trust myself; but I took a manful resolution.\n\n\"I went back to the Count to announce the arrival of his relations, and\nI saw him grown young again in the reflected light of hope.\n\n\"'What ails you, Maurice?' said he, struck by my changed expression.\n\n\"'Monsieur le Comte----'\n\n\"'No longer Octave? You, to whom I shall owe my life, my happiness----'\n\n\"'My dear Octave, if you should succeed in bringing the Countess back\nto her duty, I have studied her well'--(he looked at me as Othello must\nhave looked at Iago when Iago first contrived to insinuate a suspicion\ninto the Moor's mind)--'she must never see me again; she must never know\nthat Maurice was your secretary. Never mention my name to her, or\nall will be undone.... You have got me an appointment as Maitre\ndes Requetes--well, get me instead some diplomatic post abroad, a\nconsulship, and do not think of my marrying Amelie.--Oh! do not be\nuneasy,' I added, seeing him draw himself up, 'I will play my part to\nthe end.'\n\n\"'Poor boy!' said he, taking my hand, which he pressed, while he kept\nback the tears that were starting to his eyes.\n\n\"'You gave me the gloves,' I said, laughing, 'but I have not put them\non; that is all.'\n\n\"We then agreed as to what I was to do that evening at Honorine's house,\nwhither I presently returned. It was now August; the day had been hot\nand stormy, but the storm hung overhead, the sky was like copper; the\nscent of the flowers was heavy, I felt as if I were in an oven, and\ncaught myself wishing that the Countess might have set out for the\nIndies; but she was sitting on a wooden bench shaped like a sofa, under\nan arbor, in a loose dress of white muslin fastened with blue bows,\nher hair unadorned in waving bands over her cheeks, her feet on a small\nwooden stool, and showing a little way beyond her skirt. She did not\nrise; she showed me with her hand to the seat by her side, saying:\n\n\"'Now, is not life at a deadlock for me?'\n\n\"'Life as you have made it, I replied. 'But not the life I propose to\nmake for you; for, if you choose, you may be very happy....'\n\n\"'How?' said she; her whole person was a question.\n\n\"'Your letter is in the Count's hands.'\n\n\"Honorine started like a frightened doe, sprang to a few paces off,\nwalked down the garden, turned about, remained standing for some\nminutes, and finally went in to sit alone in the drawing-room, where I\njoined her, after giving her time to get accustomed to the pain of this\nponiard thrust.\n\n\"'You--a friend? Say rather a traitor! A spy, perhaps, sent by my\nhusband.'\n\n\"Instinct in women is as strong as the perspicacity of great men.\n\n\"'You wanted an answer to your letter, did you not? And there was but\none man in the world who could write it. You must read the reply, my\ndear Countess; and if after reading it you still find that your life is\na deadlock, the spy will prove himself a friend; I will place you in\na convent whence the Count's power cannot drag you. But, before going\nthere, let us consider the other side of the question. There is a law,\nalike divine and human, which even hatred affects to obey, and which\ncommands us not to condemn the accused without hearing his defence.\nTill now you have passed condemnation, as children do, with your ears\nstopped. The devotion of seven years has its claims. So you must read\nthe answer your husband will send you. I have forwarded to him, through\nmy uncle, a copy of your letter, and my uncle asked him what his reply\nwould be if his wife wrote him a letter in such terms. Thus you are not\ncompromised. He will himself bring the Count's answer. In the presence\nof that saintly man, and in mine, out of respect for your own dignity,\nyou must read it, or you will be no better than a wilful, passionate\nchild. You must make this sacrifice to the world, to the law, and to\nGod.'\n\n\"As she saw in this concession no attack on her womanly resolve, she\nconsented. All the labor or four or five months had been building up to\nthis moment. But do not the Pyramids end in a point on which a bird may\nperch? The Count had set all his hopes on this supreme instant, and he\nhad reached it.\n\n\"In all my life I remember nothing more formidable than my uncle's\nentrance into that little Pompadour drawing-room, at ten that evening.\nThe fine head, with its silver hair thrown into relief by the entirely\nblack dress, and the divinely calm face, had a magical effect on the\nComtesse Honorine; she had the feeling of cool balm on her wounds, and\nbeamed in the reflection of that virtue which gave light without knowing\nit.\n\n\"'Monsieur the Cure of the White Friars,' said old Gobain.\n\n\"'Are you come, uncle, with a message of happiness and peace?' said I.\n\n\"'Happiness and peace are always to be found in obedience to the\nprecepts of the Church,' replied my uncle, and he handed the Countess\nthe following letter:--\n\n\"'MY DEAR HONORINE,--\n\n\"'If you had but done me the favor of trusting me, if you had read the\nletter I wrote to you five years since, you would have spared yourself\nfive years of useless labor, and of privations which have grieved me\ndeeply. In it I proposed an arrangement of which the stipulations will\nrelieve all your fears, and make our domestic life possible. I have much\nto reproach myself with, and in seven years of sorrow I have discovered\nall my errors. I misunderstood marriage. I failed to scent danger when\nit threatened you. An angel was in the house. The Lord bid me guard it\nwell! The Lord has punished me for my audacious confidence.\n\n\"'You cannot give yourself a single lash without striking me. Have mercy\non me, my dear Honorine. I so fully appreciated your susceptibilities\nthat I would not bring you back to the old house in the Rue Payenne,\nwhere I can live without you, but which I could not bear to see again\nwith you. I am decorating, with great pleasure, another house, in the\nFaubourg Saint-Honore, to which, in hope, I conduct not a wife whom I\nowe to her ignorance of life, and secured to me by law, but a sister\nwho will allow me to press on her brow such a kiss as a father gives the\ndaughter he blesses every day.\n\n\"'Will you bereave me of the right I have conquered from your\ndespair--that of watching more closely over your needs, your pleasures,\nyour life even? Women have one heart always on their side, always\nabounding in excuses--their mother's; you never knew any mother but my\nmother, who would have brought you back to me. But how is it that you\nnever guessed that I had for you the heart of a mother, both of my\nmother and of your own? Yes, dear, my affection is neither mean nor\ngrasping; it is one of those which will never let any annoyance last\nlong enough to pucker the brow of the child it worships. What can you\nthink of the companion of your childhood, Honorine, if you believe\nhim capable of accepting kisses given in trembling, of living between\ndelight and anxiety? Do not fear that you will be exposed to the laments\nof a suppliant passion; I would not want you back until I felt certain\nof my own strength to leave you in perfect freedom.\n\n\"'Your solitary pride has exaggerated the difficulties. You may, if you\nwill, look on at the life of a brother, or of a father, without either\nsuffering or joy; but you will find neither mockery nor indifference,\nnor have any doubt as to his intentions. The warmth of the atmosphere\nin which you live will be always equable and genial, without tempests,\nwithout a possible squall. If, later, when you feel secure that you\nare as much at home as in your own little house, you desire to try some\nother elements of happiness, pleasures, or amusements, you can expand\ntheir circle at your will. The tenderness of a mother knows neither\ncontempt nor pity. What is it? Love without desire. Well, in me\nadmiration shall hide every sentiment in which you might see an offence.\n\n\"'Thus, living side by side, we may both be magnanimous. In you the\nkindness of a sister, the affectionate thoughtfulness of a friend, will\nsatisfy the ambition of him who wishes to be your life's companion; and\nyou may measure his tenderness by the care he will take to conceal\nit. Neither you nor I will be jealous of the past, for we may each\nacknowledge that the other has sense enough to look only straight\nforward.\n\n\"'Thus you will be at home in your new house exactly as you are in the\nRue Saint-Maur; unapproachable, alone, occupied as you please, living by\nyour own law; but having in addition the legitimate protection, of\nwhich you are now exacting the most chivalrous labors of love, with the\nconsideration which lends so much lustre to a woman, and the fortune\nwhich will allow of your doing many good works. Honorine, when you long\nfor an unnecessary absolution, you have only to ask for it; it will not\nbe forced upon you by the Church or by the Law; it will wait on your\npride, on your own impulsion. My wife might indeed have to fear all the\nthings you dread; but not my friend and sister, towards whom I am bound\nto show every form and refinement of politeness. To see you happy is\nenough happiness for me; I have proved this for the seven years past.\nThe guarantee for this, Honorine, is to be seen in all the flowers made\nby you, carefully preserved, and watered by my tears. Like the _quipos_,\nthe tally cords of the Peruvians, they are the record of our sorrows.\n\n\"'If this secret compact does not suit you, my child, I have begged\nthe saintly man who takes charge of this letter not to say a word in\nmy behalf. I will not owe your return to the terrors threatened by the\nChurch, nor to the bidding of the Law. I will not accept the simple and\nquiet happiness that I ask from any one but yourself. If you persist\nin condemning me to the lonely life, bereft even of a fraternal smile,\nwhich I have led for nine years, if you remain in your solitude and show\nno sign, my will yields to yours. Understand me perfectly: you shall be\nno more troubled than you have been until this day. I will get rid\nof the crazy fellow who has meddled in your concerns, and has perhaps\ncaused you some annoyance...'\n\n\"'Monsieur,' said Honorine, folding up the letter, which she placed in\nher bosom, and looking at my uncle, 'thank you very much. I will avail\nmyself of Monsieur le Comte's permission to remain here----'\n\n\"'Ah!' I exclaimed.\n\n\"This exclamation made my uncle look at me uneasily, and won from the\nCountess a mischievous glance, which enlightened me as to her motives.\n\n\"Honorine had wanted to ascertain whether I were an actor, a bird\nsnarer; and I had the melancholy satisfaction of deceiving her by my\nexclamation, which was one of those cries from the heart which women\nunderstand so well.\n\n\"'Ah, Maurice,' said she, 'you know how to love.'\n\n\"The light that flashed in my eyes was another reply which would have\ndissipated the Countess' uneasiness if she still had any. Thus the Count\nfound me useful to the very last.\n\n\"Honorine then took out the Count's letter again to finish reading it.\nMy uncle signed to me, and I rose.\n\n\"'Let us leave the Countess,' said he.\n\n\"'You are going already Maurice?' she said, without looking at me.\n\n\"She rose, and still reading, followed us to the door. On the threshold\nshe took my hand, pressed it very affectionately, and said, 'We shall\nmeet again...'\n\n\"'No,' I replied, wringing her hand, so that she cried out. 'You love\nyour husband. I leave to-morrow.'\n\n\"And I rushed away, leaving my uncle, to whom she said:\n\n\"'Why, what is the matter with your nephew?'\n\n\"The good Abbe completed my work by pointing to his head and heart, as\nmuch as to say, 'He is mad, madame; you must forgive him!' and with all\nthe more truth, because he really thought it.\n\n\"Six days after, I set out with an appointment as vice-consul in Spain,\nin a large commercial town, where I could quickly qualify to rise in the\ncareer of a consul, to which I now restricted my ambition. After I had\nestablished myself there, I received this letter from the Count:--\n\n\"'MY DEAR MAURICE,--\n\n\"'If I were happy, I should not write to you, but I have entered on a\nnew life of suffering. I have grown young again in my desires, with all\nthe impatience of a man of forty, and the prudence of a diplomatist, who\nhas learned to moderate his passion. When you left I had not yet been\nadmitted to the _pavillon_ in the Rue Saint-Maur, but a letter had\npromised me that I should have permission--the mild and melancholy\nletter of a woman who dreaded the agitations of a meeting. After waiting\nfor more than a month, I made bold to call, and desired Gobain to\ninquire whether I could be received. I sat down in a chair in the avenue\nnear the lodge, my head buried in my hands, and there I remained for\nalmost an hour.\n\n\"'\"Madame had to dress,\" said Gobain, to hide Honorine's hesitancy under\na pride of appearance which was flattering to me.\n\n\"'During a long quarter of an hour we both of us were possessed by an\ninvoluntary nervous trembling as great as that which seizes a speaker on\nthe platform, and we spoke to each other sacred phrases, like those of\npersons taken by surprise who \"make believe\" a conversation.\n\n\"'\"You see, Honorine,\" said I, my eyes full of tears, \"the ice is\nbroken, and I am so tremulous with happiness that you must forgive the\nincoherency of my language. It will be so for a long time yet.\"\n\n\"'\"There is no crime in being in love with your wife,\" said she with a\nforced smile.\n\n\"'\"Do me the favor,\" said I, \"no longer to work as you do. I have heard\nfrom Madame Gobain that for three weeks you have been living on your\nsavings; you have sixty thousand francs a year of your own, and if you\ncannot give me back your heart, at least do not abandon your fortune to\nme.\"\n\n\"'\"I have long known your kindness,\" said she.\n\n\"'\"Though you should prefer to remain here,\" said I, \"and to preserve\nyour independence; though the most ardent love should find no favor in\nyour eyes, still, do not toil.\"\n\n\"'I gave her three certificates for twelve thousand francs a year each;\nshe took them, opened them languidly, and after reading them through she\ngave me only a look as my reward. She fully understood that I was not\noffering her money, but freedom.\n\n\"'\"I am conquered,\" said she, holding out her hand, which I kissed.\n\"Come and see me as often as you like.\"\n\n\"'So she had done herself a violence in receiving me. Next day I found\nher armed with affected high spirits, and it took two months of habit\nbefore I saw her in her true character. But then it was like a delicious\nMay, a springtime of love that gave me ineffable bliss; she was no\nlonger afraid; she was studying me. Alas! when I proposed that she\nshould go to England to return ostensibly to me, to our home, that she\nshould resume her rank and live in our new residence, she was seized\nwith alarm.\n\n\"'\"Why not live always as we are?\" she said.\n\n\"'I submitted without saying a word.\n\n\"'\"Is she making an experiment?\" I asked myself as I left her. On my way\nfrom my own house to the Rue Saint-Maur thoughts of love had swelled in\nmy heart, and I had said to myself, like a young man, \"This evening she\nwill yield.\"\n\n\"'All my real or affected force was blown to the winds by a smile, by a\ncommand from those proud, calm eyes, untouched by passion. I remembered\nthe terrible words you once quoted to me, \"Lucretia's dagger wrote in\nletters of blood the watchword of woman's charter--Liberty!\" and\nthey froze me. I felt imperatively how necessary to me was Honorine's\nconsent, and how impossible it was to wring it from her. Could she guess\nthe storms that distracted me when I left as when I came?\n\n\"'At last I painted my situation in a letter to her, giving up the\nattempt to speak of it. Honorine made no answer, and she was so sad that\nI made as though I had not written. I was deeply grieved by the idea\nthat I could have distressed her; she read my heart and forgave me. And\nthis was how. Three days ago she received me, for the first time, in\nher own blue-and-white room. It was bright with flowers, dressed, and\nlighted up. Honorine was in a dress that made her bewitching. Her hair\nframed that face that you know in its light curls; and in it were some\nsprays of Cape heath; she wore a white muslin gown, a white sash with\nlong floating ends. You know what she is in such simplicity, but that\nday she was a bride, the Honorine of long past days. My joy was chilled\nat once, for her face was terribly grave; there were fires beneath the\nice.\n\n\"'\"Octave,\" she said, \"I will return as your wife when you will. But\nunderstand clearly that this submission has its dangers. I can be\nresigned----\"\n\n\"'I made a movement.\n\n\"'\"Yes,\" she went on, \"I understand: resignation offends you, and you\nwant what I cannot give--Love. Religion and pity led me to renounce my\nvow of solitude; you are here!\" She paused.\n\n\"'\"At first,\" she went on, \"you asked no more. Now you demand your wife.\nWell, here I give you Honorine, such as she is, without deceiving you as\nto what she will be.--What shall I be? A mother? I hope it. Believe\nme, I hope it eagerly. Try to change me; you have my consent; but if\nI should die, my dear, do not curse my memory, and do not set down to\nobstinacy what I should call the worship of the Ideal, if it were not\nmore natural to call the indefinable feeling which must kill me the\nworship of the Divine! The future will be nothing to me; it will be your\nconcern; consult your own mind.\"\n\n\"'And she sat down in the calm attitude you used to admire, and watched\nme turning pale with the pain she had inflicted. My blood ran cold. On\nseeing the effect of her words she took both my hands, and, holding them\nin her own, she said:\n\n\"'\"Octave, I do love you, but not in the way you wish to be loved. I\nlove your soul.... Still, understand that I love you enough to die in\nyour service like an Eastern slave, and without a regret. It will be my\nexpiation.\"\n\n\"'She did more; she knelt before me on a cushion, and in a spirit of\nsublime charity she said:\n\n\"'\"And perhaps I shall not die!\"\n\n\"'For two months now I have been struggling with myself. What shall I\ndo? My heart is too full; I therefore seek a friend, and send out this\ncry, \"What shall I do?\"'\n\n\"I did not answer this letter. Two months later the newspapers announced\nthe return on board an English vessel of the Comtesse Octave, restored\nto her family after adventures by land and sea, invented with sufficient\nprobability to arouse no contradiction.\n\n\"When I moved to Genoa I received a formal announcement of the happy\nevent of the birth of a son to the Count and Countess. I held that\nletter in my hand for two hours, sitting on this terrace--on this bench.\nTwo months after, urged by Octave, by M. de Grandville, and Monsieur de\nSerizy, my kind friends, and broken by the death of my uncle, I agreed\nto take a wife.\n\n\"Six months after the revolution of July I received this letter, which\nconcludes the story of this couple:--\n\n\"'MONSIEUR MAURICE,--I am dying though I am a mother--perhaps because\nI am a mother. I have played my part as a wife well; I have deceived my\nhusband. I have had happiness not less genuine than the tears shed by\nactresses on the stage. I am dying for society, for the family, for\nmarriage, as the early Christians died for God! I know not of what I am\ndying, and I am honestly trying to find out, for I am not perverse; but\nI am bent on explaining my malady to you--you who brought that heavenly\nphysician your uncle, at whose word I surrendered. He was my director;\nI nursed him in his last illness, and he showed me the way to heaven,\nbidding me persevere in my duty.\n\n\"'And I have done my duty.\n\n\"'I do not blame those who forget. I admire them as strong and necessary\nnatures; but I have the malady of memory! I have not been able twice to\nfeel that love of the heart which identifies a woman with the man she\nloves. To the last moment, as you know, I cried to your heart, in the\nconfessional, and to my husband, \"Have mercy!\" But there was no mercy.\nWell, and I am dying, dying with stupendous courage. No courtesan was\never more gay than I. My poor Octave is happy; I let his love feed on\nthe illusions of my heart. I throw all my powers into this terrible\nmasquerade; the actress is applauded, feasted, smothered in flowers; but\nthe invisible rival comes every day to seek its prey--a fragment of\nmy life. I am rent and I smile. I smile on two children, but it is the\nelder, the dead one, that will triumph! I told you so before. The dead\nchild calls me, and I am going to him.\n\n\"'The intimacy of marriage without love is a position in which my soul\nfeels degraded every hour. I can never weep or give myself up to dreams\nbut when I am alone. The exigencies of society, the care of my child,\nand that of Octave's happiness never leave me a moment to refresh\nmyself, to renew my strength, as I could in my solitude. The incessant\nneed for watchfulness startles my heart with constant alarms. I have not\nsucceeded in implanting in my soul the sharp-eared vigilance that lies\nwith facility, and has the eyes of a lynx. It is not the lip of one I\nlove that drinks my tears and kisses them; my burning eyes are cooled\nwith water, and not with tender lips. It is my soul that acts a part,\nand that perhaps is why I am dying! I lock up my griefs with so much\ncare that nothing is to be seen of it; it must eat into something, and\nit has attacked my life.\n\n\"'I said to the doctors, who discovered my secret, \"Make me die of some\nplausible complaint, or I shall drag my husband with me.\"\n\n\"'So it is quite understood by M. Desplein, Bianchon, and myself that\nI am dying of the softening of some bone which science has fully\ndescribed. Octave believes that I adore him, do you understand? So I am\nafraid lest he should follow me. I now write to beg you in that case\nto be the little Count's guardian. You will find with this a codicil in\nwhich I have expressed my wish; but do not produce it excepting in case\nof need, for perhaps I am fatuously vain. My devotion may perhaps leave\nOctave inconsolable but willing to live.--Poor Octave! I wish him a\nbetter wife than I am, for he deserves to be well loved.\n\n\"'Since my spiritual spy is married, I bid him remember what the florist\nof the Rue Saint-Maur hereby bequeaths to him as a lesson: May your wife\nsoon be a mother! Fling her into the vulgarest materialism of household\nlife; hinder her from cherishing in her heart the mysterious flower\nof the Ideal--of that heavenly perfection in which I believed, that\nenchanted blossom with glorious colors, and whose perfume disgusts us\nwith reality. I am a Saint-Theresa who has not been suffered to live on\necstasy in the depths of a convent, with the Holy Infant, and a spotless\nwinged angel to come and go as she wished.\n\n\"'You saw me happy among my beloved flowers. I did not tell you all: I\nsaw love budding under your affected madness, and I concealed from you\nmy thoughts, my poetry; I did not admit you to my kingdom of beauty.\nWell, well; you will love my child for love of me if he should one day\nlose his poor father. Keep my secrets as the grave will keep them. Do\nnot mourn for me; I have been dead this many a day, if Saint Bernard\nwas right in saying that where there is no more love there is no more\nlife.'\"\n\n\"And the Countess died,\" said the Consul, putting away the letters and\nlocking the pocket-book.\n\n\"Is the Count still living?\" asked the Ambassador, \"for since the\nrevolution of July he has disappeared from the political stage.\"\n\n\"Do you remember, Monsieur de Lora,\" said the Consul-General, \"having\nseen me going to the steamboat with----\"\n\n\"A white-haired man! an old man?\" said the painter.\n\n\"An old man of forty-five, going in search of health and amusement in\nSouthern Italy. That old man was my poor friend, my patron, passing\nthrough Genoa to take leave of me and place his will in my hands.\nHe appoints me his son's guardian. I had no occasion to tell him of\nHonorine's wishes.\"\n\n\"Does he suspect himself of murder?\" said Mademoiselle des Touches to\nthe Baron de l'Hostal.\n\n\"He suspects the truth,\" replied the Consul, \"and that is what is\nkilling him. I remained on board the steam packet that was to take him\nto Naples till it was out of the roadstead; a small boat brought me\nback. We sat for some little time taking leave of each other--for ever,\nI fear. God only knows how much we love the confidant of our love when\nshe who inspired it is no more.\n\n\"'That man,' said Octave, 'holds a charm and wears an aureole.' the\nCount went to the prow and looked down on the Mediterranean. It happened\nto be fine, and, moved no doubt by the spectacle, he spoke these last\nwords: 'Ought we not, in the interests of human nature, to inquire\nwhat is the irresistible power which leads us to sacrifice an exquisite\ncreature to the most fugitive of all pleasures, and in spite of our\nreason? In my conscience I heard cries. Honorine was not alone in her\nanguish. And yet I would have it!... I am consumed by remorse. In the\nRue Payenne I was dying of the joys I had not; now I shall die in Italy\nof the joys I have had.... Wherein lay the discord between two natures,\nequally noble, I dare assert?'\"\n\nFor some minutes profound silence reigned on the terrace.\n\nThen the Consul, turning to the two women, asked, \"Was she virtuous?\"\n\nMademoiselle des Touches rose, took the Consul's arm, went a few steps\naway, and said to him:\n\n\"Are not men wrong too when they come to us and make a young girl a wife\nwhile cherishing at the bottom of their heart some angelic image, and\ncomparing us to those unknown rivals, to perfections often borrowed from\na remembrance, and always finding us wanting?\"\n\n\"Mademoiselle, you would be right if marriage were based on passion; and\nthat was the mistake of those two, who will soon be no more. Marriage\nwith heart-deep love on both sides would be Paradise.\"\n\nMademoiselle des Touches turned from the Consul, and was immediately\njoined by Claude Vignon, who said in her ear:\n\n\"A bit of a coxcomb is M. de l'Hostal.\"\n\n\"No,\" replied she, whispering to Claude these words: \"for he has not yet\nguessed that Honorine would have loved him.--Oh!\" she exclaimed, seeing\nthe Consul's wife approaching, \"his wife was listening! Unhappy man!\"\n\nEleven was striking by all the clocks, and the guests went home on foot\nalong the seashore.\n\n\"Still, that is not life,\" said Mademoiselle des Touches. \"That woman\nwas one of the rarest, and perhaps the most extraordinary exceptions in\nintellect--a pearl! Life is made up of various incidents, of pain and\npleasure alternately. The Paradise of Dante, that sublime expression of\nthe ideal, that perpetual blue, is to be found only in the soul; to ask\nit of the facts of life is a luxury against which nature protests every\nhour. To such souls as those the six feet of a cell, and the kneeling\nchair are all they need.\"\n\n\"You are right,\" said Leon de Lora; \"but good-for-nothing as I may be, I\ncannot help admiring a woman who is capable, as that one was, of living\nby the side of a studio, under a painter's roof, and never coming down,\nnor seeing the world, nor dipping her feet in the street mud.\"\n\n\"Such a thing has been known--for a few months,\" said Claude Vignon,\nwith deep irony.\n\n\"Comtesse Honorine is not unique of her kind,\" replied the Ambassador\nto Mademoiselle des Touches. \"A man, nay, and a politician, a bitter\nwriter, was the object of such a passion; and the pistol shot which\nkilled him hit not him alone; the woman who loved lived like a nun ever\nafter.\"\n\n\"Then there are yet some great souls in this age!\" said Camille Maupin,\nand she stood for some minutes pensively leaning on the balustrade of\nthe quay.\n\n\n\n\nADDENDUM\n\nThe following personages appear in other stories of the Human Comedy.\n\n     Bauvan, Comte Octave de\n       Scenes from a Courtesan's Life\n\n     Bianchon, Horace\n       Father Goriot\n       The Atheist's Mass\n       Cesar Birotteau\n       The Commission in Lunacy\n       Lost Illusions\n       A Distinguished Provincial at Paris\n       A Bachelor's Establishment\n       The Secrets of a Princess\n       The Government Clerks\n       Pierrette\n       A Study of Woman\n       Scenes from a Courtesan's Life\n       The Seamy Side of History\n       The Magic Skin\n       A Second Home\n       A Prince of Bohemia\n       Letters of Two Brides\n       The Muse of the Department\n       The Imaginary Mistress\n       The Middle Classes\n       Cousin Betty\n       The Country Parson\n     In addition, M.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":289,"split":"train"}
