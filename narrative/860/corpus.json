Philip Marsham, a nineteen-year-old sailor, has just been orphaned when his father's ship was lost at sea. An accident with a gun causes him to flee London, leaving behind the small inheritance left by his father. He decides to journey across England on foot, heading towards Bideford. During his travels, he encounters Sir John Bristol, a local Lord who greatly impresses the young man. He also encounters two men, Tom Jordan and Martin Barwick, who claim to be fellow sailors. Tom, who is more commonly known as the Old One, soon parts company with them, however Martin becomes Phil's traveling companion. When they reach Bideford, Martin leads the way to the house of Mother Taylor, an old woman who works as the go-between for numerous illegal activities. She informs them that the Old One has already gone ahead on a ship without them, but arranges positions for Martin and Phil on a frigate, known as the Rose of Devon.\nOnce aboard the frigate, Phil quickly impresses the captain with his skills. When the boatswain is killed in an accident, Phil is promoted to replace him. After a violent storm, the crew of the Rose of Devon encounters a wrecked ship. While rescuing the survivors, Phil is surprised to see that they are coincidentally led by the Old One. Although the Old One and his followers initially put on a mask of friendliness, they soon reveal their true nature as pirates, killing the Rose's captain and seizing control of the ship. Tempted by the promise of vast riches, the majority of the Rose's former crew willingly join the Old One. Only Phil and Will Canty, a fellow sailor of the same age, show reluctance to become pirates. Having taken an immediate liking to Phil, the Old One allows him to keep his position as Boatswain, hoping to convince him to join them willingly.\nThe newly formed band of pirates attempt several raids against other ships, but none of them go well, and they end up gaining very little. During an attempted attack against a small island town, Will Canty takes the opportunity to escape in attempt to find help. Unfortunately, he is soon recaptured by the pirates, who torture and kill him. Seeing his friend murdered is the last straw for Phil, who shortly afterwards attempts his own escape. Fleeing to a nearby island, he sees another ship anchored nearby. When he swims out to it to investigate, he discovers that it is a British warship, but is captured by its crew. He manages to convince them of the nearby pirate ship, and thus forewarned, they are able to easily defeat the Old One and his crew, and capture the Rose of Devon. Unfortunately, the British captain is unconvinced of Phil's innocence, believing instead that he was a pirate spy who, once captured, sold out his friends in an attempt to gain his freedom. Phil is arrested with the rest of the pirate crew, and taken back to England for trial.\nDuring the trial, it seems certain that the entire crew, including Phil, will be found guilty and hanged. When he is called to the stand to defend himself, Phil insists again that he was an unwilling participant in the pirates' activities. However, when he is asked to testify against the rest of the Rose's crew, he refuses on the grounds that even if it was forced upon him, they were still his companions. Impressed by Phil's courage and honor, the Old One testifies on his behalf, declaring to the court that Phil is indeed innocent of the charges against him. At the conclusion of the trial, Phil alone is acquitted. The pirate crew is executed shortly after, with only the Old One retaining his bold face until the end.\nAfter regaining his freedom, Phil journeys back to the lands of Sir John Bristol, and asks the lord to be let into his service. Phil becomes one of Sir John's closest companions for several years, and serves under him during the English Civil War on the side of the Royalists. Although Phil rises through the ranks during the war, the forces of Oliver Cromwell eventually emerge victorious, and Sir John is killed in battle. Growing weary of England, Phil decides to leave the country, and once again travels to the docks at Bideford. He is shocked to find the Rose of Devon among the ships there, and after speaking with her new captain, books passage to the colonies in Barbados.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of The Dark Frigate, by Charles Boardman Hawes\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most\nother parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions\nwhatsoever.

He lost his mother before he went into breeches and\nhe was climbing the rigging before he could walk alone. He spent two\nyears at school to the good Dr. Josiah Arber at Roehampton, for his\nfather, being a clergyman's son who had run wild in his youth, hoped\nto do better by the lad than he had done by himself, and was of a mind\nto send Philip home a scholar to make peace with the grandparents, in\nthe vicarage at Little Grimsby, whom Tom Marsham had not seen in twenty\nyears. But the boy was his father over again, and taking to books with\nan ill grace, he endured them only until he had learned to read and\nwrite and had laid such foundation of mathematics as he hoped would\nserve his purpose when he came to study navigation. Then, running away\nby night from his master's house, he joined his father on board the\nSarah ketch, who laughed mightily to see how his son took after him, do\nwhat he would to make a scholar of the lad. And but for the mercy of\nGod, which laid Philip Marsham on his back with a fever in the spring\nof his nineteenth year, he had gone down with his father in the ketch\nSarah, the night she foundered off the North Foreland.\n\nMoll Stevens kept him, while he lay ill with the fever, in her alehouse\nin High Street, in the borough of Southwark, and she was good to him\nafter her fashion, for her heart was set on marrying his father. But\nthough she had brought Tom Marsham to heel and had named the day,\nnothing is sure till the words are said.\n\nWhen they had news which there was no doubting that Tom Marsham was\nlost at sea, she was of a mind to send the boy out of her house the\nhour he was able to walk thence; and so she would have done, if God's\nprovidence had not found means to renew his strength before the time\nand send him packing in wonderful haste, with Moll Stevens and certain\nothers after him in full cry.\n\nFor the third day he had come down from his chamber and had taken the\ngreat chair by the fire, when there entered a huge-bellied countryman\nwho carried a gun of a kind not familiar to those in the house.\n\n\"Ah,\" Phil heard them whispering, as he sat in the great chair, \"here's\nJamie Barwick come back again.\" Then they called out, \"Welcome, Jamie,\nand good-morrow!\"\n\nPhilip Marsham would have liked well to see the gun himself, since a\ntaste for such gear was born in him; but he had been long bedridden,\nand though he could easily have walked over to look at it, he let well\nenough alone and stayed where he was.\n\nThey passed it from one to another and marvelled at the craftsmanship,\nand when they let the butt fall on the floor, the pots rang and the\ncans tinkled. And now one cried, \"Have care which way you point the\nmuzzle.\" But the countryman who brought it laughed and declared there\nwas no danger, for though it was charged he had spent all his powder\nand had not primed it.\n\nAt last he took it from them all and, spying Moll Stevens, who had\nheard the bustle and had come to learn the cause, he called for a can\nof ale. There was no place at hand to set down his gun so he turned to\nthe lad in the chair and cried, \"Here, whiteface with the great eyes,\ntake my piece and keep it for me. I am dry--Oh, so dry! Keep it till\nI have drunk, and gramercy. A can of ale, I say! Hostess! Moll! Moll!\nWhere art thou? A can of ale!\"\n\nHe flung himself down on a bench and mopped his forehead with his\nsleeve. He was a huge great man with a vast belly and a deep voice and\na fat red face that was smiling one minute and frowning the next.\n\n\"Ho! Hostess!\" he roared again. \"Ale, ale! A can of ale! Moll, I say! A\ncan of ale!\"\n\nA hush had fallen upon the room at his first summons, for he had been\nquiet so long after entering that his clamour amazed all who were\npresent, unless they had known him before, and they now stole glances\nat him and at one another and at Moll Stevens, who came bustling in\nagain, her face as red as his own, for she was his match in girth and\ntemper.\n\n\"Here then!\" she snapped, and thumped the can down before him on the\ngreat oaken table.\n\nHe blew off the topmost foam and thrust his hot face into the ale, but\nnot so deep that he could not send Phil Marsham a wink over the rim.\n\nThis Moll perceived and in turn shot at the lad a glance so\nill-tempered that any one who saw it must know she rued the day she had\ntaken him under her roof in his illness. He had got many such a glance\nsince word came that his father was lost, and more than glances, too,\nfor as soon as Moll knew there was nothing to gain by keeping his good\nwill she had berated him like the vixen she was at heart, although he\nwas then too ill to raise his head from the sheet.\n\nIt was a sad plight for a lad whose grandfather was a gentleman\n(although he had never seen the old man), and there had been times when\nhe would almost have gone back to school and have swallowed without a\nwhimper the Latin and Greek. But he was stronger now and nearer able to\nfend for himself and it was in his mind, as he sat in the great chair\nwith the gun, that after a few days at longest he would pay the score\nin silver from his chest upstairs, and take leave for ever of Moll\nStevens and her alehouse. So now, giving her no heed, he began fondling\nthe fat countryman's piece.\n\nThe stock was of walnut, polished until a man could see his face in it,\nand the barrel was of steel chased from breech to muzzle and inlaid\nwith gold and silver. Small wonder that all had been eager to handle\nit, the lad thought. He saw others in the room furtively observing the\ngun, and he knew there were men not a hundred leagues away who would\nhave killed the owner to take it. He even bethought himself, having no\nlack of conceit in such matters, that the man had done well to pick\nPhil Marsham to keep it while he drank his ale.\n\nThe fellow had gone to the opposite corner of the room and had taken a\ndeep seat just beneath the three long shelves on which stood the three\nrows of fine platters that were the pride of Moll Stevens's heart.\n\nThe platters caught the lad's eye and, raising the gun, he presented\nit at the uppermost row. Supposing it were loaded and primed, he\nthought, what a stir and clatter it would make to fire the charge! He\nsmiled, cocked the gun, and rested his finger on the trigger; but he\nwas over weak to hold the gun steady. As he let the muzzle fall, his\nhand slipped. His throat tightened like a cramp. His hair, he verily\nbelieved, rose on end. The gun--primed or no--went off.\n\nHe had so far lowered the muzzle that not a shot struck the topmost\nrow of platters, but of the second lower row, not one platter was\nleft standing. The splinters flew in a shower over the whole room,\nand a dozen stray shots--for the gun was charged to shoot small\nbirds--peppered the fat man about the face and ear. Worst of all, by\nfar, to make good measure of the clatter and clamour, the great mass of\nthe charge, which by grace of God avoided the fat man's head although\nthe wind of it raised his hair, struck fairly a butt of Moll Stevens's\nrichest sack, which six men had raised on a frame to make easier the\nlabour of drawing from it, and shattered a stave so that the goodly\nwine poured out as if a greater than Moses had smitten a rock with his\nstaff.\n\nOf all in the room, mind you, none was more amazed than Philip Marsham,\nand indeed for a moment his wits were quite numb. He sat with the gun\nin his hands, which was still smoking to show who had done the wicked\ndeed, and stared at the splintered platters and at the countryman's\nfurious face, on which rivulets of blood were trickling down, and at\nthe gurgling flood of wine that was belching out on Moll Stevens's\ndirty floor.\n\nThen in rushed Moll herself with such a face that he hoped never to\nsee the like again. She swept the room at a single glance and bawling,\n\"As I live, 't is that tike, Philip Marsham! Paddock! Hound! Devil's\nimp!\"--at him she came, a billet of Flanders brick in her hand.\n\nHe was of no mind to try the quality of her scouring, for although she\nknew not the meaning of a clean house, she was a brawny wench and her\nhand and her brick were as rough as her tongue. Further, he perceived\nthat there were others to reckon with, for the countryman was on his\nfeet with a murderous look in his eye and there were six besides him\nwho had started up. Although Phil had little wish to play hare to their\nhounds, since the fever had left him fit for neither fighting nor\nrunning, there was urgent need that he act soon and to a purpose, for\nMoll and her Flanders brick were upon him.\n\nWarmed by the smell of the good wine run to waste, and marvellously\nstrengthened by the danger of bodily harm if once they laid hands on\nhim, he got out of the great chair as nimbly as if he had not spent\nthree weeks in bed, and, turning like a fox, slipped through the door.\n\nGod was good to Philip Marsham, for the gun, as he dropped it,\ntripped Moll Stevens and sent her sprawling on the threshold; the fat\ncountryman, thinking more of his property than his injury, stooped for\nthe gun; and those two so filled the door that the six were stoppered\nin the alehouse until with the whoo-bub ringing in his ears Phil had\ngot him out of sight. He had the craft, though they then came after him\nlike hounds let slip, to turn aside and take to earth in a trench hard\nby, and to lie in hiding there until the hue and cry had come and gone.\nIn faith, he had neither the wind nor the strength to run farther.\n\nIt was \"Stop thief!\"--\"Murder's done!\"--\"Attach the knave!\"--\"Help!\nHelp!\"\n\nWho had dug the trench that was his hiding-place he never knew, but it\nlay not a furlong from the alehouse door, and as he tumbled into it and\nsprawled flat on the wet earth he gave the man an orphan's blessing.\nThe hue and cry passed him and went racing down the river; and when\nthe yells had grown fainter, and at last had died quite away, he got\nup out of the trench and walked as fast as he could in the opposite\ndirection, stopping often to rest, until he had left Moll Stevens's\nalehouse a good mile behind him. He passed a parish beadle, but the\nfellow gave him not a single glance; he passed the crier calling for\nsale the household goods of a man who desired to take his fortune and\ndepart for New England, and the crier (who, one would suppose, knew\neverything of the public weal) brushed his coat but hindered him not.\nIn the space of a single furlong he met two Puritans on foot, without\nenough hair to cover their ears, and two fine gentlemen on horseback\nwhose curls flowed to their shoulders; but neither one nor other gave\nhim let. The rabble of higglers and waggoners from the alehouse, headed\nby the countryman, Jamie Barwick, and by Moll Stevens herself, had\nraced far down the river, and Phil Marsham was free to go wherever else\nhis discretion bade him.\n\nNow it would have been his second nature to have fled to the docks,\nfor he was bred a sailor and could haul and reef and steer with any\nman; but they whom he had no wish to meet had gone that way and in\nhis weakness it had been worse than folly to beard them. His patrimony\nwas forfeit, for although his father had left him a bag of silver, it\nlay in his chest in Moll Stevens's alehouse, and for fear of hanging\nhe dared not go back after it. She was a vindictive shrew and would\nhave taken his heart's blood to pay him for his blunder. His father was\ngone and the ketch with him, and, save for a handful of silver the lad\nhad about him, he was penniless. So what would a sailor do, think you,\norphaned and penniless and cut off from the sea, but set himself up for\na farmer? Phil clapped his hand on his thigh and quietly laughed. That\na man needed money and skill for husbandry never entered his foolish\nhead. Were not husbandmen all fond fellows whom a lively sailor man\nmight fleer as he pleased? Nay, they knew not so much as one rope from\nanother. Why, then, he would go into the country and set him up as a\nkind of prince among husbandmen, who had, by all reports, plenty of\ngood nappy liquor to drink and bread and cheese and meat to eat.\n\nWith that he turned his back on the sea and London and on Moll Stevens,\nwhom he never saw again. His trafficking with her was well ended, and\nas well ended his father's affair, in my belief; for the woman had a\nbitter temper and a sharp tongue, and there are worse things for a\nfree-hearted, jovial man such as Tom Marsham was, than drowning. The\nson owed her nought that the bag in his chest would not repay many\ntimes over, so he set out with all good courage and with the handful of\nsilver that chanced to be in his pocket and, though his legs were weak\nand he must stop often to rest, by nightfall he had gone miles upon his\nway.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nA LEAL MAN AND A FOOL\n\n\nClouds obscured the sun and a gusty wind set the road-side grasses\nnodding and rustled the leaves of oak and ash. Phil passed between\ngreen fields into a neat village, where men and women turned to\nlook after him as he went, and on into open country, where he came\nat last to a great estate and a porter's lodge and sat him down and\nrested. There was a hoarse clamour from a distant rookery, and the\nwind whispered in two pine trees that grew beside the lodge where a\ngentleman of curious tastes had planted them. A few drops of rain,\nbeating on the road and rattling on the leaves of a great oak,\nincreased the loneliness that beset him. Where he should lie the night\nhe had no notion, or whence his supper was to come; but the shower blew\npast and he pressed on till he came to a little hamlet on the border of\na heath, where there was a smithy, with a silent man standing by the\ndoor.\n\nAs he passed the smithy the lad stumbled.\n\nThe man looked hard at him as if suspecting some trickery; but when\nPhil was about to press on without a word the man asked in a low voice,\nwho the de'il gaed yonder on sic like e'en and at sic like hoddin' gait.\n\nAt this Phil sat down on a stone, for his weakness had grown on him\nsorely, and replied that whither he was going he neither knew nor\ncared. Whereupon the man, whom he knew by his tongue to be a Scot,\ncried out, \"Hech! The lad's falling!\" And catching the youth by the\narm, he lifted him off the stone and led him into the smithy.\n\nPhil found himself in a chair with straight back and sides, but with\nseat and backing woven of broad, loose straps, which seemed as easy as\nthe best goose-feathers. \"It is nought,\" he said. \"A spell of faintness\ncaught me. I'll be going; I must find an inn; I'll be going now.\"\n\n\"Be still. Ye'll na be off sae soon.\"\n\nThe man thrust a splinter of wood into the coals, and lighting\ntherewith a candle in a lanthorn, he began rummaging in a cupboard\nbehind the forge, whence he drew out a quarter loaf, a plate of cheese,\na jug, and a deep dish in which there was the half of a meat pie.\nPlacing before his guest a table of rough boards blackened with smoke,\na great spoon, and a pint pot, he poured from the jug a brimming potful\nof cider, boiled with good spices and fermented with yeast.\n\n\"A wee healsome drappy,\" said he, \"an' then the guid vittle. Dinna be\nlaithfu'.\"\n\nRaising the pot to his lips the lad drank deep and became aware he was\nfamished for food, although he had not until then thought of hunger. As\nhe ate, the quarter loaf, the cheese, and the half of a meat pie fell\nvictims to his trenchering, and though his host plied the jug to fill\nhis cup, when at last he leaned back he had left no morsel of food nor\ndrop of drink.\n\nNow, for the first time, he looked about him and gave heed to the\nsmoking lanthorn, the dull glow of the dying sea-coals in the forge,\nthe stern face of the smith who sat opposite him, and the dark recesses\nof the smithy. Outside was a driving rain and the screech of a gusty\nwind.\n\nIt was strange, he thought, that after all his doubts, he was well fed\nand dry and warm. The rain rattled against the walls of the smithy\nand the wind howled. Only to hear the storm was enough to make a man\nshiver, but warmed by the fire in the forge the lad smiled and nodded.\nIn a moment he was asleep.\n\n\"Cam' ye far?\" his host asked in a rough voice.\n\nThe lad woke with a start. \"From London,\" he said and again he nodded.\n\nThe man ran his fingers through his red beard. \"God forgie us!\" he\nwhispered. \"The laddie ha grapit a' the way frae Lon'on.\"\n\nHe got up from his chair and led Phil to a kind of bed in the darkest\ncorner, behind the forge, and covered him and left him there. Going to\nthe door he looked out into the rain and stood so for a long time.\n\nTwo boys, scurrying past in the rain, saw him standing there against\nthe dim light of the lanthorn, and hooted in derision. The wind swept\naway their voices so that the words were lost, but one stooped and,\npicking up a stone, flung it at the smithy. It struck the lintel above\nthe man's head and the boys with a squeal of glee vanished into the\nrain and darkness. The blood rushed to the man's face and his hand\nslipped under the great leathern apron that he wore.\n\nBy morning the storm was gone. The air was clean and cool, and though\npuddles of water stood by the way, the road had so far dried as to give\ngood footing. All this Philip Marsham saw through the smithy door, upon\nwaking, as he raised himself on his elbow.\n\nHe had slept that night with his head behind the cupboard and with his\nfeet under the great bellows of the forge, so narrow was the space in\nwhich the smith had built the cot; and where his host had himself\nslept there was no sign.\n\nThe smith now stood in the door. \"Na, na,\" he was saying, \"'tis pitch\nan' pay--siller or nought. For the ance ye hae very foully deceived me.\nYe shall hence-forth hae my wark for siller; or, an ye like--\"\n\nA volley of rough laughter came booming into the smithy, and then a\nclatter of hoofs as the man without rode away; but the face of the\nsmith was hot as flame when he turned to the forge, and, as he thrust\nhis fingers through his red beard, an angry light was in his eyes.\nReaching for the handle of the bellows, he blew the fire so fiercely\nthat the rockstaff and the whole frame swayed and creaked. He then took\nup a bar of metal and, breaking it on the anvil with a great blow of\nthe up-hand sledge, studied the grey surface and smiled. He thrust the\nbar into the white coals and with the slicer he clapped the coals about\nit.\n\nNow drawing out the bar a little way to see how it was taking its heat,\nand now thrusting it quickly back again, he brought it to the colour\nof white flame, and, snatching it out with his pliers and laying it on\nthe face of the anvil, he shaped it with blow after blow of the hand\nhammer, thrust it again into the coals and blew up the fire, again laid\nit on the anvil, and, smiting it until the sparks flew in showers,\nworked it, with a deftness marvellous in the eyes of the lad, who sat\nagape at the fury of his strokes, into the shape of a dagger or dirk.\n\nAt last, heating it in the coals to the redness of blood and throwing\nit on the floor to cool, he paced the smithy, muttering to himself.\nAfter a time he took it up again and with the files in their order--the\nrough, the bastard, the fine and the smooth--worked it down, now\ntrying the surface with fingertips, now plying his file as if the Devil\nwere at his elbow and his soul's salvation depended upon haste, until\nthe shape and surface pleased him.\n\nHe then thrust it again into the coals and blew up the fire softly,\nwatching the metal with great care till it came to blood-red heat, when\nhe quenched it in a butt of water and, laying it on the bench, rubbed\nit with a whetstone until the black scurf was gone and the metal was\nbright. Again he laid it in the coals and slowly heated it, watching\nwith even greater care while the steel turned to the colour of light\ngold and to the colour of dark gold; then with a deft turn of the\npliers he snatched it out and thrust it deep into the water.\n\nAs he had worked, his angry haste had subsided and now, drawing out the\nmetal, he studied it closely and smiled. Then he looked up and meeting\nthe eyes of Philip Marsham, who had sat for an hour watching him, he\ngave a great start and cried, \"God forgie us! I hae clean forgot the\nlad!\"\n\nLaying aside his work he pushed before the chair the smoke-stained\ntable he had used the night before, placed on it a bowl and a spoon,\nand, setting a small kettle on the forge, blew up the fire until the\nkettle steamed. He then poured porridge from the kettle into the bowl,\nand bringing from the cupboard a second quarter-loaf, nodded at the lad\nand, as an afterthought, remarked, \"There's a barrel o' water ahint the\nsmiddy, an ye'd wash.\"\n\nRising, Phil went out and found the barrel, into which he thrust head\nand hands to his great refreshment; and returning, he sat down to the\nbread and porridge.\n\nWhile Phil ate, the smith worked at a bit of bone which he shaped to\nhis desire as a handle for the dirk.\n\nWith light taps of the riveting-hammer he drove it into place and bound\nit fast with ferules chosen from a box under the cot. He then sat\nlooking a long time at Phil, nodded, smiled, ran his fingers through\nhis beard, smiled again and, with a fine tool, fell to working on the\nferules. There had been a friendly look in the lad's eyes, and of\nfriendly looks the smith had got few in England. People bought his work\nbecause he was a master craftsman, but the country folk of England\nhad little love for the Scots who came south in King James's time and\nafter, and a man had need to look sharp lest he fall victim to theft\nor worse than theft. He stopped and again looked at his guest, ran his\nfingers through his beard and demanded suddenly, \"Thy name, laddie?\"\n\n\"Philip Marsham.\"\n\n\"Ye'll spell it out for me?\"\n\nThis Phil did.\n\nAfter working a while longer he said as if in afterthought, \"Ye'll bide\nwi' me a while?\"\n\n\"No, I must be on my way.\"\n\nThe man sighed heavily but said only, \"I hae ta'en a likin' to ye.\"\n\nRising, the lad thrust his hand into his bosom and stood as if to take\nhis leave.\n\n\"Na, na! Dinna haste! I'll ask ye to gie me help wi' a bit that's yet\nto be done.\"\n\nThe smith turned his work over and over. He had made a dirk with a\nhandle of bone bound with silver, and, as he turned it, he examined it\nwith utmost care. \"'Twill do,\" he said at last, \"and noo for the wark\nthat takes twa pair o' hands.\"\n\nHe pointed to a great grindstone.\n\n    'He that will a guid edge win,\n    Maun forge thick an' grind thin.'\n\nSitting down at the grindstone, the lad began to turn it while the\nsmith, now dashing water over it, now putting both hands to the work,\nground the dirk. An hour passed, and a second, with no sound save the\nwhir of steel on stone and now and again the muttered words:--\n\n    'He that will a guid edge win,\n    Maun forge thick an' grind thin.'\n\nLeaning back at last, he said \"'Tis done! An' such wark is better\nsuited to a man o' speerit than priggin' farriery.\"\n\nHe tried the edge with his thumb and smiled. From a chip he sliced a\nthin circular shaving that went with and across and against the grain.\nLaying a bit of iron on a board, he cut it clean in two with the dirk\nand the edge showed neither nick nor mark.\n\nPhil rose now, and drew from inside his shirt his small pouch of\nsilver. \"I'll pay the score,\" he said.\n\nThe Scot stared at him as if he would not believe his ears, then got up\nas if to thrust the dirk between the lad's ribs.\n\n\"Those are very foul words,\" he said thickly. \"Nae penny nor plack\nwill I take, and were ye a man bearded, I'd leave ye a pudding for the\nhoodie-craw.\"\n\nThe lad reddened and stammered, \"I--I--why, I give you thanks and ask\nyour pardon.\"\n\nThe smith drew himself up and was about to speak harshly, but he saw\nthe lad's eyes filling and knew no harm was intended. He caught his\nbreath and bit his beard. \"'Tis forgi'en an' forgot,\" he cried. \"I hae\nta'en a likin' to ye an' here's my hand on't. I hae made ye the dirk\nfor a gift an' sin ye maun be on your way, ye shall hae my ane sheath,\nfor I've no the time to mak' ye the mate to it e'er ye'll be leavin'\nme.\"\n\nWith that he drew out his dirk, sheath and all, and placing the new\nblade in the old leather, handed it to the lad, saying, \"'Tis wrought\no' Damascus steel and there's not twa smiths in England could gi'e ye\nthe like.\"\n\nSo with few words but with warm friendliness they parted, and Philip\nMarsham went away over the heath, wondering how a Scottish smith came\nto be dwelling so many long leagues south of the border. In those days\nthere were many Scots to be found in England, who had sought long since\nto better their fortunes by following at the heels of their royal\ncountryman; but he had chanced to meet with few of them.\n\nNot until he had gone miles did he draw the dirk and read, cut in fine\nold script on the silver ferule, the legend, _Wrought by Colin Samson\nfor Philip Marsham_. There are those who would say it was a miracle out\nof Bible times, but neither Philip Marsham nor I ever saw a Scot yet\nwho would not share his supper with a poorer man than himself.\n\nAt the end of the day he bought food at a cottage where the wife did\nnot scruple to charge him three times the worth of the meal, and\nthat night he lay under a hedge; the day thereafter he chanced upon\na shepherd with whom he passed the night on the hills, and the third\nday he came to an inn where the reckoning took all but a few pence of\nhis silver. So as he set out upon his way in the morning, he knew not\nwhence his supper was to come or what roof should cover his head.\n\nIt was a fine day, with white clouds blowing across a blue sky and all\nthe colors as bright as in a painted picture, and there was much for a\nsailor to marvel at. The grass in the meadows waved in the great wind\nlike running water. The river in the valley was so small and clear and\nstill that, to a man bred at sea, it appeared to be no water at all but\na toy laid between hills, with toy villages for children on its banks.\nClimbing with light quick steps a knoll from which there was a broader\nprospect, Phil came unawares upon a great thick adder, which lay\nsunning its tawny flanks and black-marked back but which slipped away\ninto a thicket at the jar of footsteps. The reptile gave him a lively\nstart, but it was soon gone, and from the knoll he saw the valley\nspread before him for miles.\n\nIt was a day to be alive and, though Philip Marsham was adrift in a\nstrange world, with neither chart nor compass to show the way, his\nstrength had at last come back to him and he had the blithe spirit that\nseasons a journey well. His purse was light but he was no lad to be\nstayed for lack of wind, and seeing now a man far ahead of him on the\nroad, and perceiving an opportunity to get sailing directions for the\nfuture, he leaped down from the knoll and set off after the fellow as\nhard as he could post.\n\nThe man had gone another mile before Phil overhauled him and by then\nPhil was puffing so loudly that the fellow, who carried a huge book\nunder his arm and bore himself very loftily, turned to see what manner\nof creature was at his heels. Although he had the air of a great man,\nhis coat was now revealed as worn and spotted and his wristbands were\ndirty. He frowned, bent his head, and pursued his journey in silence.\n\n\"Good morrow to you!\" Phil cried and fell into step beside him.\n\nThe man answered not a word but frowned and hugged his book and walked\nthe faster.\n\nAt that Phil bustled up and laid hand on his dirk. \"Good morrow, I say.\nHast no tongue between thy teeth?\"\n\nThe fellow hugged his book the tighter and frowned the darker and\nfiercely shook his head. \"Never,\" he cried, \"was a man assaulted with\nsuch diversity of thoughts! Yet here must come a lobcock lapwing and\ncry 'Good morrow!' I will have you know I am one to bite sooner than to\nbark.\"\n\nAlready he was striding at a furious gait, yet now, giving a hitch to\nhis mighty book, he made shift to lengthen his stride and go yet faster.\n\nUnhindered by any such load, Phil pressed at his heels.\n\n\"'A lobcock'? 'A lapwing'?\" he cried. \"Thou puddling quacksalver--\"\n\nStopping short and giving him a look of dark resentment, the fellow\nsadly shook his head. \"That was a secret and most venomous blow.\"\n\n\"I gave you good morrow and you returned me nought but ill words.\"\n\n\"The shoe must be made for the foot. I have no desire to go posting\nabout the country with a roystering coxcomb but--well--as I say, I have\nno liking for thy company, which consorts ill with the pressure of many\nthoughts; but since you know what you know (and the Devil take him who\nlearned you it!), like it or not, I must even keep thy company with\nsuch grace as may be. Yea, though thou clappest hand to thy weapon\nwith such facility that I believe thee sunk to thy neck in the Devil's\nquagmire, bogged in thy sin, and thy hands red with blood.\"\n\nWith that, he set out again but at an ordinary pace, and Phil,\nwonderfully perplexed by his words, fell into his step.\n\nAgain the fellow shook his head very sadly. \"A secret and most venomous\nblow! Th' art a Devon man?\"\n\n\"Nay, I never saw Devon.\"\n\nThe fellow shot him a strange glance and shifted the book from one arm\nto the other.\n\n\"And have never seen Devon? Never laid foot in Bideford, I'll venture.\"\nThere was a cunning look in his eyes and again he shifted the book.\n\n\"'Tis even so.\"\n\n\"A most venomous blow! This wonderfully poseth me.\" After a time he\nsaid in a very low voice, \"There is only one other way. Either you have\ntold me a most wicked lie or Jamie Barwick told you.\"\n\nThe fellow, watching like a cat at a rat-hole, saw Phil start at the\nsound of Jamie Barwick's name.\n\n\"I knew it!\" he cried. \"He'd tell, he'd tell! He's told before--'twas\nhe took the tale to Devon. He's a tall fellow but I'll hox him yet. It\nwas no fault of mine--though I suppose you'll not believe that.\"\n\nUpon the mind of Philip Marsham there descended a baffling array of\nmemories. The name of the big countryman with the gun carried him back\nto that afternoon in Moll Stevens's alehouse, whence with good cause\nhe had fled for his life. And now this stray wight, with a great folio\nvolume under his arm, out of a conglomeration of meaningless words had\nsuddenly thrown at the lad's head the name of Jamie Barwick.\n\n\"We must have this out between us,\" the fellow said at last, breathing\nhard. \"I'll not bear the shadow longer. Come, let us sit while we\ntalk, for thereby we may rest from our travels. You see, 'twas thus\nand so. Jamie Barwick and I came out of Devon and took service with\nSir John--Jamie in the stables, for he has a way with horses, and I as\nunder-steward till my wits should be appreciated, which I made sure,\nI'd have you know, would be soon, for there are few scholars that can\nmatch my curious knowledge of the moon's phases and when to plant corn\nor of the influence of the planets on all manner of husbandry; and\nfurther, I have kept the covenant of the living God, which should make\nall the devils in hell to tremble; and if England keeps it she shall\nbe saved from burning. So when I made shift to get the ear of Sir\nJohn, who hath a sharp nose in all affairs of his estate, said I,--and\nit took a stout heart, I would have you know, for he is a man of hot\ntemper,--said I, if he would engage a hundred pounds at my direction I\nwould return him in a year's time a gain of a fourth again as much as\nall he would engage.\n\n\"'Aha!'\" quoth he, \"'this is speech after mine own heart. A hundred\npounds, sayest thou? 'Tis thine to draw upon, and the man who can turn\nhis talents thus shall be steward of all mine estates. But mind,'--and\nhere he put his finger to his nose, for he hath keen scent for a\njest,--'thou shalt go elsewhere to try the meat on the dog, for I'll be\nno laughingstock; and if thou fail'st then shalt thou go packing, bag\nand baggage, with the dogs at thy heels. Is 't a bargain?'\n\n\"Now there was that in his way of speech which liked me little, for I\nam used to dealing with quieter men and always I have given my wits to\nbooklearning and to Holy Writ rather than to bickering. But I could\nnot then say him nay, for he held his staff thus and so and laughed in\nhis throat in a way that I have a misliking of. So I said him yea, and\ntook in my own name fifty acres of marsh land, and paid down more than\nthirty pound sterling, and expended all of eight pound sterling for the\nploughing and twice that for the burning, and sowed it with rape-seed\nat ninepence the acre, and paid twelve pound for the second ploughing\nand eleven pound for the fencing--all this did I draw from Sir John,\nwho, to pay the Devil his due, gave it me with a free hand; and if\nGod had been pleased to send the ordinary blessing upon mine acres I\nshould have got from it at harvest three hundred or four hundred or\neven five hundred quarters of good rape-seed. And what with reaping and\nthreshing and all, at four and twenty shillings the quarter I should\nhave repaid him his hundred pounds, threefold or fourfold. All this by\nthe blessing of God should I have done but for some little bugs that\ncame upon mine acres in armies, and the fowls of the air that came in\nclouds and ate up my rape-seed and my tender young rape, so that I lost\nall that I laid out. And Sir John would not see that in another year I\nought, God favouring me, to get him back his silver I had lost, even as\nthe book says. He is a man of his word and, crying that the jest was\nworth the money, he sent me out the gate with the dogs at my heels and\nwith Jamie Barwick laughing till his fat belly shook, to see me go; for\nI was always in terror of the dogs, which are great tall beasts that\ndelight to bark and snap at me. And the last word to greet my ears, ere\nI thought they would have torn me limb from limb, was Sir John bawling\nat me, 'Thou puddling quacksalver!' which Jamie Barwick hath told in\nBideford, making thereby such mirth that I can no longer abide there\nbut must needs flit about the country. And lo! even thou, who by speech\nand coat are not of this country at all, dost challenge me by the very\nwords he used.\"\n\nPhil lay meditating on the queer fate that had placed those words in\nhis mouth. \"Who,\" he said at last, \"is this Sir John?\"\n\n\"'Who is Sir John?'\" The fellow turned and looked at him. \"You have\ncome from farther than I thought, not to know Sir John Bristol.\"\n\n\"Sir John Bristol? I cannot say I have heard that name.\"\n\n\"Hast never heard of Sir John Bristol? In faith, thou art indeed a\nstranger hereabouts. He is a harsh man withal, and doubtless my ill\nharvest was the judgment of God upon me for hiring myself to serve\na cruel, blasphemous knight who upholdeth episcopacy and the Common\nPrayer book.\"\n\n\"And whom,\" asked the lad, \"do you serve now?\"\n\n\"Ah! I, who would make a skillful, faithful, careful steward, am\nteaching a school of small children, and erecting horoscopes for\ncountry bumpkins, so low has that harsh knight's ill-considered jest\ncast me. ''Twas worth the money,' quoth he; but it had paid him in\ngolden guineas had he had the wit and patience to wait another year.\"\nThe fellow closed his eyes, tossed back his long hair, and pressed his\nhands on his forehead. \"Never, never,\" he cried, \"was a man assaulted\nwith such diversity of thoughts!\"\n\nPhilip Marsham contemplated him as if from a distance and thought that\nnever was there a long-haired scarecrow better suited for the butt of a\nthousand jests.\n\nThere were people passing on the road, an old man in a cart, a woman,\nand two men carrying a jug between them, but Phil was scarcely aware\nof them, or even of the lank man beside him, so absorbing were his\nthoughts, until the man rose, clasping his book in both hands and\nrunning his tongue over his lips.\n\nHis mouth worked nervously. \"I must be off, I must be off. There they\nare again, and the last time I thought I should perish ere I got free\nof them. O well-beloved, O well-beloved! they have spied me already. If\nI go by the road, they'll have me; I must go by wood and field.\"\n\nTurning abruptly, he plunged through a copse and over a hill, whence,\nhis very gait showing his fear, he speedily disappeared.\n\nAnd the two men, having set their jug down beside the road, were\nlaughing till they reeled against each other, to see him go.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nTWO SAILORS ON FOOT\n\n\nAs the two men roared with laughter by the wayside so that the noise\nof it made people a quarter-mile away turn round to see what was the\nmatter, those who passed eyed them askance and gave them the width of\nthe road. But to the few passers the two paid no heed at all. Pointing\nwhither the lank fellow with the book had gone, they roared till they\nchoked; then they fell on each other's necks, and embracing, whispered\ntogether.\n\nSeparating somewhat unsteadily, they now looked hard at Philip Marsham\nwho knew their kind and feared them not at all. Shifting his dirk\nwithin easy reach of his hand, and so drawing his knees together that\nhe could spring instantly to one side or the other, he coolly waited\nfor them to come nearer, which they did.\n\nThe foremost was a fat, impudent scoundrel with very red cheeks and a\nvery crafty squint. The other was thin and dark, less forward, but if\none were to judge by his eyes, by far the braver. Both had put on long\nfaces, which consorted ill with their recent laughter, and both, it was\nplain, were considerably the worse for strong drink.\n\nThe first glanced back over his shoulder at the second, who gave him a\nnudge and pushed him forward.\n\n\"Ahem,\" he began huskily. \"You see before you, my kind young gentleman,\ntwo shipwrecked mariners who have lost at sea all they possess and are\nnow forced to beg their way from London into Devon Port where, God\nwilling, they will find a berth waiting for them. They--ahem--ahem--\"\nHe scratched his head and shut his eyes, then turning, hoarsely\nwhispered, \"Yea, yea! So far is well enough, but what came next?\"\n\nThe other scowled blackly. \"Bear on,\" he whispered. \"Hast forgot the\ntale of calamities and wrecks and sharks?\"\n\n\"Yea, yea! Troubles, my kind young gentleman, have somewhat bepuzzled\nmy weary wits. As I was about to say, we have journeyed into those\nfar seas where the hot sun besetteth a poor sailor with calentures,\nand nasty rains come with thunder and flash, and the wind stormeth\noutrageously and the poor sailor, if he is spared falling from the\nshrouds into the merciless waves,--for he must abide the brunt of\nthose infectious rains upon the decks to hand in the sails,--goeth wet\nto his hammock and taketh aches and burning fevers and scurvy. Yea,\nwe have seen the ravenous shark or dog-fish (which keepeth a little\npilot-fish scudding to and fro to bring it intelligence of its prey)\ndevour a shipmate with its double row of venomous teeth. Surely, then,\nyoung gentleman, kind young gentleman, you for whom we have brought\nhome curious dainties from that strange and fearful sea, will give us a\ngolden guinea to speed us on our way; or if a guinea be not at hand, a\ncrown; or sparing a crown, a shilling; or if not a shilling, sixpence.\nNought will come amiss--nay, even a groat will, by the so much, help\ntwo poor sailors on their way.\"\n\nAs the two looked down at Philip Marsham, a score of old tales he had\nheard of worthless sailors who left the sea and went a-begging through\nthe kingdom came to his mind. It was a manner of life he had never\nthought of for himself, nor had he a mind to it now. But he knew their\ngame and, which was more, he knew that he held a higher trump than\nthey. He leaned back and looked up at them and very calmly smiled.\n\n\"How now!\" the spokesman blustered. \"Dost laugh at a tale so sad as\nmine? I ha' killed an Italian fencing-master in my time. I ha' fought\nprizes at half the fairs in England.\"\n\nHis companion laid a hand on his arm and whispered in his ear.\n\n\"Nay,\" he retorted angrily, \"'tis nought but a country fellow. I'll\nsoon overbear him.\"\n\nAgain Phil smiled. \"Hast thou never,\" he said in a quiet voice, \"heard\nthe man at the mainmast cry, 'A liar, a liar!' and for a week kept\nclean the beakhead and chains? Nay, I'll be bound thou hast sat in\nbilbowes or been hauled under the keel. The marshal doubtless knew thee\nwell.\"\n\nThe faces of the two men changed. The fat man who had been the\nspokesman opened his mouth and was at loss for words, but the thin,\ndark man began to laugh and kept on laughing till he could hardly stand.\n\n\"We ha' reached for a pheasant and seized a hawk,\" he cried. \"Whence\ncame you, my gay young gallant, and what are you doing here?\"\n\n\"Why, I am here to set myself up for a farmer. I had a reason for\nleaving London--\"\n\nAgain the thin man burst out laughing. \"Why, then,\" quoth he, \"we are\nthree men of like minds. So had Martin and I a reason for leaving\nLondon, too. And you are one who hath smelt salt water in your time.\nNay, deny it not. Martin's sails are still a-flutter for wind, so\nsorely did you take him aback. 'Twas a shrewd thrust and it scored.\nWhy, now, as for farming,\"--he spread his hands and lifted his\nbrows,--\"come with us. There's a certain vessel to sail from Bideford\non a certain day, and for any such tall lad as thou I'll warrant\nthere'll be a berth.\"\n\nLeaning back against a little hill, the lad looked from the red,\nimpudent face of the fat man to the amused, lean, daring face of his\ncompanion and away at the hills and meadows, the green trees and\nploughed fields, and the long brown road that would lead the man who\nfollowed its windings and turnings, however far afield they might\nwander, all the way across England from the Channel to the Severn. He\nhad made port, once upon a time, in Bristol and he remembered lifting\nLundy's Island through the fog. A fair countryside lay before him, with\nthe faint scent of flowered meadows and the fragrance of blossoming\nfruit-trees on the wind, but the sea was his home and the half-witted\ncreature with the book and the ranting talk of ploughing and planting\nhad made the lad feel the more his ignorance of country matters, a\nsuspicion of which had been growing on him since first he left the town\nand port behind him. These were not men he would have chosen, but he\nhad known as bad and he was lost in a wilderness of roads and lanes\nand never-ending hills and meadows and woods, with villages one after\nanother. Any port in a storm--any pilot who knew his bearings! And\nfor the matter of that, he had seen rough company before. Though his\ngrandparents were gentlefolk, his father had led a rough life and the\nson had learned from childhood to bear with low humour and harsh talk.\n\nThe lean man still smiled, and though Martin was angry still, neither\nthe lad nor the man heeded him.\n\n\"I could bear you company, but--\" A doubt crept on him: when sober they\nmight be of quite another mind.\n\n\"Nay, say us no buts.\"\n\n\"I have neither money nor gear for a journey.\"\n\n\"Nor we--come!--Nay, I am not so deep in my cups that I do not know my\nown mind.\" The man chuckled, perceiving that his intuition had fathomed\nthe lad's hesitation.\n\nRising, Phil looked at the two again. He was as tall as they, if not\nso broad. After all, it was only Martin whose head was humming with\nliquor; the lean man, it now appeared, was as sober as he pleased to be.\n\n\"And if I have no money?\"\n\n\"We are the better matched.\"\n\nThey returned to the highway, where Martin and the thin man took up\nthe jug between them, each holding by his forefinger one of its two\nhandles, and together all three set out. But the jug was heavy and they\nprogressed slowly.\n\n\"In faith, the day's warm and the road is dusty and I must drink\nagain,\" said Martin at last.\n\nThey stopped and set the jug down in the road.\n\n\"You must pay,\" said the thin man.\n\nTaking from his pocket a penny, Martin handed it to his companion and\nfilling a great cup, drained it to the bottom. He then shook the jug,\nwhich showed by the sound that there was little left.\n\nThey walked on a while; then the thin man stopped. \"I'll take a bit of\nsomething myself,\" he said. He took the penny out of his pocket, handed\nit to Martin, filled the cup and drained it.\n\nBoth then looked at Phil. \"It is tuppence a quantum,\" said the thin\nman. \"Have you tuppence?\"\n\nPhil shook his head, and the three went on together.\n\nThree times more they stopped. The penny changed hands and one or the\nother drank. Martin's speech grew thicker and his companion's face\nflushed.\n\n\"Neither one of us nor the other,\" said the thin man, with a flourish\nof his hand, \"is often seen in drink. There is a reason for it this\ntime, though. 'If any chuff,' say I, 'can buy good wine for a half\ncrown the jug and sell it at profit for tuppence the can, why cannot\nwe?' So we ha' laid down our half crown and set out upon the road to\npeddle our goods, when Martin must needs drink for his thirst, which,\nas the Scripture hath it, endureth forever. 'But,' quoth I, 'for every\npot a penny to him and a penny to me.' 'Why,' quoth he,\"--lowering his\nvoice, the thin man whispered to Phil, \"He is a rare fool at times,\"\nthen resumed in his ordinary voice,--\"'Why,' quoth he, 'here's thy\npenny for thee.' So, presently, I to him: his penny for the wine that I\ndrink. Before we have gone far it comes upon me as a wondrous thrifty\nthought, that the more we drink the more we earn.\"--Again he whispered\nto Phil, drawing him aside, \"When I had drunk a few cans, which much\nenlivened my wits, I saw he was not so great a fool as I had thought;\"\nand resumed his ordinary voice--\"'Tis little wonder that all the world\ndesires to keep an alehouse or a tavern!\"\n\nNever was there plainer example of befuddled wits! Passing back and\nforth, from one to the other, the single penny, the two had consumed\ntheir stock in trade, believing that they were earning great profit on\ntheir investment. Perceiving that the jug was nearly empty, Phil waited\nwith quiet interest for the outcome.\n\nThey stopped again in the road. Martin handed the penny to the thin\nman and poured from the jug into the cup. There was a gurgle or two and\nthe jug was empty. The cup was but half full.\n\n\"'Tis not full measure,\" he muttered, \"but let it be.\" He emptied the\ncup and wiped his lips.\n\n\"Now,\" said the thin man, his face by this time fully as red as his\nfellow's, \"where's thy store of silver? Count and share, count and\nshare.\"\n\n\"Thou hast it, pence and pounds.\"\n\nMartin's eyes half closed and his head nodded. Breathing hard, he sat\ndown beside the road.\n\n\"Nay, th'art drunk. Come, now, thy purse and a just division.\" Out of a\nfog of wild notions the befuddled thin man had pitched upon this alone,\nthat Martin withheld from him their common profit from their adventure\ninto trade. He had keen mind and strong will, and his head had long\nresisted the assaults of the wine; but wine is a cunning, powerful foe\nand not easily discouraged, which by sapping and mining can accomplish\nthe fall of the tallest citadel; and now, although steadier on his\nfeet, the fellow was nearly as drunk as his mate and in no condition to\nperceive the flaw in his own logic.\n\nTo all this Martin gave no heed at all. He covered his eyes with his\nhands and uttering a prolonged groan, cried thickly,--apparently to\nPhil,--\"And did you ever see a man dance on air! Ah, a hanging is a\nsight to catch the breath in your throat and make an emptiness in a\nman's belly!\"\n\n\"Tush!\" the thin man cried. Leaning over Martin he thrust his hands\ninto pocket, pouch and bosom. \"Where hast thou hid it?\" he fiercely\nwhispered.\n\nMartin tried to stand and fell weakly back, but slapped the thin man\nacross the face as he did so.\n\nIn an instant the thin man had out a knife and was pressing the point\nfirmly against Martin's ribs.\n\nOver Martin's florid face there came a ghastly pallor. \"Let me go!\"\nhe yelled. \"Take away thy knife, thou black-hearted, thrice accurst\nold goat! I've nought of thine. O Tom, to use me thus basely!\" And\nsprawling on his back, he wriggled under the knife like a great,\nhelpless hog.\n\nThe thin man smiled. To Phil Marsham his face seemed to have grown\nlike pictures of the Devil in old books. He held the knife against\nthe shrieking fat man's breast and pressed it the harder when Martin\nclutched at his wrist, then with a fierce \"Pfaw!\" of disgust released\nhis victim and stood erect. \"Pig!\" he whispered. \"See!\" The point of\nthe knife was red with blood. \"Th'art not worth killing. Thy thin blood\nwould quench the fire of a fleshed blade.\"\n\nWith that, he deliberately spat in the man's face, and turning, went\noff alone.\n\nThey were two sober men that watched him go, for the fumes of liquor\nhad fled from the fat man's brain as he lay with the knife at his\nheart, and of their wine Phil Marsham had taken not a drop. Striding\naway, the thin man never looked behind him; and still showing them only\nhis back, he passed out of sight.\n\nMartin remained as pale as before he had been red. He rubbed his sore\nbreast where the knife had pricked him, and gulped three or four times.\n\"Ah-h-h!\" he breathed. \"God be praised, he's gone!\" He made the sign of\nthe cross, then cast a sharp glance at Phil to see if he had noticed.\n\"God be praised, he's gone! He hath a cruel humour. He will kill for a\nword, when the mood is on him. I thought I was a dead man. Ah-h-h!\"\n\nThe colour returned to his round face and the sly, crafty look returned\nto his eyes. \"We'll find him at Bideford, though, and all will go well\nagain. He'll kill for a word--nay, for a thought! But he never bears a\ngrudge--against a friend. We'll lie tonight, my lad, with a roof over\nour heads, and by dawn we'll take the road.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nTHE GIRL AT THE INN\n\n\nAs they came at nightfall to the inn whither Martin had been determined\nthey should find their way, a coach drawn by two horses clattered down\nthe village street and drew up at the inn gate before them. There was\ncalling and shouting. Hostlers came running from the stables and stood\nby the horses' heads. The landlord himself stood by the coach door to\nwelcome his guests and servants unloaded their boxes. The coachman in\nlivery sat high above the tumult, his arms folded in lofty pride, and\nout of the coach into the light from the inn door there stepped an\nold gentleman who gallantly handed down his lady. The hostlers leaped\naway from the bridles, the coachman resumed the reins, and when the\nprocession of guests, host, and servants had moved into the great room\nwhere a fire blazed on the hearth, the horses, tossing their heads,\nproceeded to the stable.\n\nAll this the two foot-weary travellers saw, as unobserved in the bustle\nand stir, they made their way quietly toward the rear of the building.\nWhen they passed a dimly lighted window Martin glanced slyly around and\nwith quick steps ran over to it and peeped in. Whatever he sought, he\nfailed to find it, and he returned with a scowl. The two had chosen the\nopposite side of the house from the stable and no one perceived their\ncautious progress. Martin repeated his act at a second window and at a\nthird, but he got small satisfaction, as his steadily darkening frown\nindicated.\n\nThey came at last to a brighter window than any of the others, and this\nhe approached with greater caution. He crouched under it and raised\nhis great head slowly from the very corner until one eye saw into the\nroom, which was filled with light and gave forth the clatter and hum of\na great domestic bustling. Here he remained a long time, now ducking\nhis head and now bobbing it up again, and when he came away a smile had\nreplaced his frown. \"She's here,\" he whispered. \"From now on we've a\nplain course to sail, without rock or sandbar.\"\n\nThey retraced their steps and went boldly round the inn to the kitchen\ndoor. There were lights in the stable and men talking loudly of one\nthing and another. From the kitchen door, which stood ajar, came\nthe rattle of dishes and the smell of food and a great bawling and\nclamouring as the mistress directed and the maids ran.\n\nWith a jaunty air and an ingratiating smile, Martin boldly stepped to\nthe door. He knocked and waited but no one heeded his summons. A scowl\nreplaced his smile and he knocked with redoubled vigour. The sound rang\nout clearly in the inn yard. Several men came to the door of the stable\nto see what was the matter and the clamour in the kitchen ceased. Steps\napproached, a firm hand threw wide the door, and a woman cried with\nharsh voice, \"Well, then, what'll you have, who come to the back when\nhonest folk go to the front?\"\n\nThere was for a moment a disagreeable cast in Martin's eyes, but his\nfacile mouth resumed its easy smile. \"An it please you, mistress, there\nare two gentlemen here would have a word with Nell Entick.\"\n\n\"Gentlemen!\" she cried with a great guffaw. \"Gentry of the road, I make\nno doubt, who would steal away all the girl has--it's little enough,\nGod knows.\"\n\nA couple of men came sauntering out of the stable and the kitchen maids\nstood a-titter.\n\nMartin sputtered and stammered and grew redder than before, which she\nperceiving, bawled in a great voice that rang through the kitchen and\nfar into the house, \"Nell Entick, Nell Entick! Devil take the wench,\nis she deaf as an adder? Nell Entick, here's a 'gentleman' come to the\nkitchen door to see thee, his face as red as a reeky coal to kindle a\npipe of tobacco with.\"\n\nA shrill chorus of women's laughter came from the kitchen, echoed by\na chorus of bass from the stable, and Phil Marsham stepped back in\nthe dark, unwilling to be companioned with the man who had drawn such\nridicule upon himself. But as Martin thrust himself forward with a show\nof bluster and bravado, the click of light footsteps came down the\npassage, and through the kitchen walked a girl whose flush of anger\nwondrously became her handsome face.\n\n\"Where is the wretch,\" she cried, and stepping on the doorstone, stood\nface to face with Martin.\n\n\"So, 'tis thou,\" she sneered. \"I thought as much. Well--\" she suddenly\nstopped, perceiving Phil, who stood nearly out of sight in the shadow.\n\"Who is that?\" she asked.\n\nThe mistress had returned to the kitchen, the girls to their work, the\nmen to the stable.\n\n\"Th'art the same wench,\" Martin cried in anger, seizing at her hand.\n\"Hard words for old acquaintance, and a warm glance for a strange face.\"\n\nShe snatched her hand away and cuffed him on the ear with a force that\nsent him staggering.\n\nThough he liked it little, he swallowed his wrath.\n\n\"Come, chuck,\" he coaxed her, \"let bygones lie. Tell me, will he turn\nhis hand to help his brother?\"\n\nShe laughed curtly. \"The last time he spoke your name, he said he would\nput his hand in his pocket to pay the sexton that dug your grave and\nwould find pleasure in so doing; but that he'd then let you lie with\nnever a stone to mark the place, and if the world forgot you as soon as\nhe, the better for him.\"\n\n\"But sure he could not mean it?\"\n\n\"He did.\"\n\nMartin swore vilely under his breath.\n\nFrom the kitchen came the landlady's voice. \"Nell Entick, Nell, I say!\nGad-about! Good-for-nought!\"\n\n\"Go to the stable,\" she whispered, \"and tell them I sent you to wait\nthere. She'll be in better humour in an hour's time. It may be I can\neven bring you in here.\"\n\nShe shot another glance over Martin's shoulder at the slim form of Phil\nMarsham and went away smiling.\n\nFew in the stable looked twice at the two strangers in worn coats and\ndusty shoes who entered and sat on a bench by the wall, for there is\nas much pride of place in a stable as in a palace. There was talk\nof racing and hunting and fairs, and the beasts champed their oats,\nand everywhere was the smell of horses and harness. Presently there\ncame from the inn a coachman in livery and him they greeted with nods\nand good-morrows, for he was sleek and well fed and, after a manner,\nhaughty, which commanded their respect. He sat down among them affably,\nas one conscious of his place in the world but desiring--provided they\nrecognized him as a man of position--to be magnanimous to all; and\nafter inquiring into the welfare of his horses he spoke of the weather\nand the roads.\n\n\"Hast come far?\" a wrinkled old man asked.\n\n\"Aye, from Larwood.\"\n\n\"The horses stood the day's travel well?\"\n\n\"Aye, they are good beasts. But much depends on proper handling. It\nmakes a deal of difference who holds the reins.\" He looked about with\nan air of generous patronage. \"That, and their meat.\" He nodded toward\none of the men. \"'Tis well, though, when at night they are well fed, to\nfill the rack with barley-straw or wheat ere leaving them, as I showed\nthee, that perceiving it is not pleasant they may lie down and take\ntheir rest, which is in itself as good as meat for the next day's work.\"\n\nA general murmur of assent greeted this observation.\n\n\"Goest far?\" another asked.\n\n\"Aye, to Lincoln.\"\n\nA rumble of surprise ran about the stable and the deference of the\nstablemen visibly increased.\n\n\"Hast been long away?\"\n\n\"Aye, six weeks to the day.\"\n\n\"It do take a deal of silver to travel thus.\"\n\n\"Aye, aye.\" He condescended to smile. \"But there are few of the clergy\nin England can better afford a journey to the Isle o' Wight than the\ngood Dr. Marsham, and he is one who grudges nought when his lady hath\nbeen ill. 'Tis wonderful what travel will do for the ailing. Aye, he\nhath visited in many great houses and I have seen good company while we\nhave been on the road.\"\n\nPhil had looked up. \"Where is this Doctor Marsham's home?\" he asked.\n\nAll frowned at the rash young man's temerity in thus familiarly\naccosting the powerful personage in livery, and none more accusingly\nthan the personage himself; but with a scornful lift of his brows\nhe replied in a manner to tell all who were present that such as he\nwere above mere arrogance. \"Why, young man, he comes from a place you\ndoubtless never heard of, keeping as you doubtless do, so close at\nhome: from Little Grimsby.\"\n\nMartin glanced at Phil. \"The name, it seems, is thine own. Hast ever\nbeen at Little Grimsby?\"\n\n\"Never.\"\n\nAnd with that they forgot Philip Marsham, or at all events treated him\nas if he had never existed.\n\n\"'Tis few o' the clergy ride in their own coaches,\" someone said, with\nan obsequiousness that went far to conciliate the magnificent coachman.\n\n\"Aye, very few,\" he said smiling, \"but Dr. Marsham is well connected\nand a distant relation some years since left him a very comfortable\nfortune--not to mention that in all England there are few better\nlivings than his. There is no better blood in the country than runs in\nhis veins. You'd be surprised if I was to tell you of families he's\nconnected with.\"\n\nSo the talk ran.\n\nPresently a little boy appeared from the darkness beyond the door and\nhunting out Martin, touched his shoulder and beckoned. Martin, having\nlong nursed his ill temper, rose. \"It is time,\" he said, \"yea, more\nthan time.\" With swagger and toss he elbowed his way out past the\nliveried coachman; but missing Phil he turned and saw him still sitting\non the bench, his eyes fixed on the harness hanging on the opposite\nwall.\n\n\"Come, come,\" he called loudly. \"Come, make haste! Where are thy wits?\nPhil, I say!\"\n\nStarting suddenly awake from his revery, Phil got up and followed\nMartin out of the stable, seeing no one, and so blindly pressed at his\nheels, so little heeded what went on about him, that the sudden burst\nof laughter his absence of mind had occasioned passed unheard over his\nhead.\n\nIn the kitchen, whither the boy led them, they found places laid at one\nend of a great table and Nell Entick waiting to serve them, who gave\nMartin cold glances but looked long and curiously at Phil Marsham. The\nmistress and the other girls were gone. The boy sat in the corner, by\nthe great fireplace where the roast had been turning on the now empty\nspit. Nell set before them a pitcher of beer and all that was left of a\nvenison pasty.\n\nMartin ate greedily and whispered to her and talked in a mumbling\nundertone, but she gave him short answers till his temper flew beyond\nhis grasp and he knocked over his beer in reaching for her. \"Witch!\" he\nsnarled. \"Yea, look him in the eye! His wits are a-wandering again.\"\n\nLooking up, Phil met her eyes staring boldly into his. He leaned back\nand smiled, for she was a comely lass.\n\n\"Have the two guests who came tonight in a coach gone yet to bed?\" he\nasked.\n\n\"How should I know that?\"\n\nHis question baffled her and she looked at him from under her long\nlashes, half, perhaps, in search of some hidden meaning in his words,\nbut certainly a full half because she knew that her eyes were her best\nweapons and that the stroke was a telling one. She made little of his\nmeaning but her thrust scored.\n\nHe looked at her again and marked the poise of her shapely head,\nthe curves of neck and shoulders, the full bosom, the bare arms. But\nhis mind was still set on that other matter and he persisted in his\ndesign. \"I want,\" he said slowly, \"to see them--to see them without\ntheir knowing or any one's knowing--except you and me.\" Here he met her\nat her own game, and he was not so far carried away but that he could\ninwardly smile to see his own shot tell.\n\n\"They have supped in the little parlor and are sitting there by the\nfire,\" she whispered. \"It may cost me my place--but--\"\n\nAgain she looked at him under her long lashes. He gave her as good as\nshe sent, and she whispered, \"Come, then--come.\"\n\nMartin gave an angry snort over his beer, but she returned a hot glance\nand an impatient gesture. With Phil pressing close at her heels she\nled the way out of the kitchen and down a long passage. Stopping with\nher finger on her lips, she very quietly opened a door and motioned\nhim forward. Again her finger at her lips! With her eyes she implored\nsilence.\n\nWithout so much as the creaking of a board he stepped through the door.\nA second door, which stood ajar, led into the little parlor and through\nthe crack he saw an old man with long white hair and beard--an old man\nwith a kindly face mellowed by years of study, perhaps by years of\ndisappointment and anxiety. The old man's eyes were shut, for he was\ndozing. In a chair on the other side of the hearth a lady sat, but only\nthe rich border of her gown showed through the partly open door.\n\nThe lad stood there with a lump in his throat and a curious mingling\nof emotions in his heart and head. It had happened so suddenly,\nso strangely, he felt that baffling sense of unreality which comes\nsometimes to all of us. He touched the wall to make sure he was not\ndreaming. Had he but stayed in school, as his father had desired, and\ngone back to Little Grimsby, who knew what might have come of it? But\nno! He was a penniless vagabond, a waif astray on the highroads of\nEngland. He was now of a mind to speak out; now of a mind to slip like\na fox to earth. His gay, gallant ne'er-do-weel of a father was gone. He\nwas alone in the world save for his chance acquaintance of the road,\nwhich was perhaps worse than being entirely alone. What madness--he\nwondered as he looked at the kindly face of the drowsy old man--had led\nTom Marsham away from his home? Or was it more than a mere mad prank?\nHad the manners of a country vicarage so stifled him that he became\ndesperate? As Phil thought of Martin drinking in the kitchen, a wave\nof revulsion swept over him; but after all, his father had kept such\ncompany in his own life, and though he had brought up the boy to better\nthings, the father's reckless and adventurous nature, in spite of his\nbest intentions, had drawn the son into wild ways. Something rose in\nPhil's throat and choked him, but the hot pride that came straightly\nand honestly from his father now flamed high. He knew well enough that\nTom Marsham had had his faults, and of a kind to close upon him the\ndoors of such a home as the vicarage at Little Grimsby; but he had been\na lovable man none the less and Tom Marsham's son was loyal.\n\nThe girl, daring not speak, was tugging at Phil's coat in an agony of\nmisgivings. He stepped softly back, closed the door on a world he might\nhave entered, and carried away with him the secret that would have\nbrought peace--if a sad, almost bitter peace--to two lonely souls.\n\nHe paused in the passage and the girl stopped beside him. There was\nno one in sight or hearing, and he kissed her. Such is the curious\ncomplexity with which impressions and emotions crowd upon one, that\neven while the vicarage at Little Grimsby and his dead father were\nuppermost in his thoughts, he was of a mind then and for many a long\nday thereafter to come back and marry her. Since he had closed the door\nthrough which he might have passed, this was a golden dream to cling to\nin hard times and glad, he thought. For he had caught her fancy as well\nas she his and she kissed him full on the lips; and being in all ways\nhis father's son, he fell victim to a kitchen wench's bright eyes at\nthe very moment when Little Grimsby was within his reach, as has father\nhad done before him. Then they walked out into the kitchen, trying to\nappear as if nothing had happened, and Martin, perceiving their red\ncheeks, only sneered.\n\n\"You must sleep on the hay,\" she whispered; and to Martin, \"I'll send\nhim word before morning and give you his reply.\"\n\nSo they again followed the little boy through the darkness to the\nstable by a back way, and climbed a ladder to the great mow and crawled\nbehind a mountain of hay, and lay with their thoughts to bear them\ncompany while men far below talked of country affairs, horses were\ntrampling uneasily in their stalls, and the little boy was off through\nthe night with a message.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nSIR JOHN BRISTOL\n\n\nThere was not a cloud in the sky at dawn. Cocks crowed lustily, near\nand loud or far and faint. The blue light grew stronger and revealed\nthe sleeping village and the rambling old inn and the great stable,\nwhere the horses stood in their stalls and pulled at the hay and\npease in the racks or moved uneasily about. The stars became dim and\ndisappeared. The rosy east turned to gold and the dark hills turned to\nblue and the village stirred from its sleep.\n\nThe master of the inn came down, rubbing his eyes and yawning, to the\ngreat room where one of the maids, bedraggled with sleep, was brushing\nthe hearth and another was clearing a table at which two village\nroysterers had sat late. The master was in an evil temper, but for the\nmoment there was no fault to be found with the maids, so he left them\nwithout a word and went through the long passage to the kitchen.\n\nSeeing there a candle, which had burned to a pool of tallow, still\nguttering faintly in its socket, he cried out at the waste and reached\nto douse the feeble flame, then stopped in anger, for in a chair by the\ntable, on which he had rested his head and arms, the little boy sat\nfast asleep.\n\n\"Hollo!\" the master bawled.\n\nUp started the little boy, awake on the instant and his eyes wide with\nfear.\n\n\"What in the fiend's name hast thou been up to, this night?\" quoth the\nmaster in a fierce bellow.\n\nThe little boy burst into tears. \"He'll have nought to do with him,\"\nhe wailed. \"'Twas a long way and fearful dark but I went it, every\nstep, and ferreted him out and gave him the message; and he swore most\nwickedly and bade me tell the man go to a place I don't like to name,\nand bade me tell Nell Entick he took it ill of her to traffic with such\nas that brother of his.\"\n\n\"Ah-ha!\" cried the host, belting his breeches tighter. \"Most shrewdly\ndo I suspect there have been strange doings hereabouts. Where's Nell\nEntick? Nell Entick, I say, Nell Entick!\" His voice went through the\nhouse like thunder. The sashes rattled and the little boy quaked.\n\nDown came the hostess and in came the maids--all but Nell Entick.\n\n\"Nell Entick! Where's Nell Entick, I say! Fiend take the wench--where's\nNell Entick?\"\n\nThen in came the sleepy hostlers, and the coachman, his livery all awry\nfrom his haste--but not Nell Entick. For Nell Entick, a-tremble with\nwell-founded apprehensions, having gone late to bed and slept heavily,\nhad risen just after the host, had followed him down the passage and,\nafter listening at the door until she made sure her worst fears were\nrealized, had darted back along the passage and out through the inn\nyard to the stable where as loudly as she dared, but not loudly enough\nto rouse the weary sleepers above, she was calling, \"Martin! Martin!\nAwake, I say, or they'll all be upon thee! Martin, awake!\"\n\nThe host in fury seized the little boy by the ear and dragged him\nshrieking across the table. \"Now, sirrah,\" quoth he, \"of whom mak'st\nthou this squalling and squealing? A stick laid to thy bum will\ndoubtless go far to keep thy soul from burning.\"\n\n\"Unhand me!\" he squalled. \"She'll kill me, an I tell.\"\n\n\"An thou tellest not, thou slubbering noddy, I'll slice thee into\ncollops of veal.\" And still holding the unhappy child by the ear, the\nhost, making a ferocious face, reached for a long and sharp knife.\n\n\"I'll tell--I'll tell--'Tis the two men that slept in the hay.\"\n\n\"Ha! The hounds are in cry.\"\n\nAnd with that the host released his victim and dashed, knife in hand,\nout the kitchen door. The household trailed at his heels. The sleeping\nguests woke in their chambers and faces appeared at curtained windows.\n\nNell Entick fled from the stable as he came roaring, but seeing her\nnot, he mounted the ladder and plunged into the hay with wild thrusts\nof his knife in all directions. \"Hollo! Hollo!\" he yelled. \"At 'em,\ndogs, at 'em!\" And the two sleepers in the far corner of the mow, as\nthe household had done before them, started wide awake.\n\nFor the second time since they had met, Martin, crouching in the hay,\ncrossed himself, then shot a scared glance at Phil. Martin was white\nround the lips and his hands were shaking like the palsy. \"Said he\naught of hanging?\" he whispered. But Philip Marsham was then in no\nmood to heed his chance companion, whose bubble of bluster he had seen\npricked three times.\n\nWhat had occurred was plain enough and the two were cornered like rats;\nbut Phil got up on his toes, shielded from sight by a mound of hay,\nand squatting low, got in his arms as much of the hay as he could grasp.\n\nBawling curses and thrusting this way and that with his knife, the host\ncame steadily nearer. He passed the mound. He saw the two. Knife in\nhand he plunged at them over the hay, with a yell of triumph. But his\nfooting was none of the best, and as he came, Phil rose with a great\narmful of hay to receive the knife-thrust and sprang at him.\n\nThus thrown off his balance, the man fell and the lad, catching his\nwrist and dexterously twisting it, removed the knife from his hand and\nflung it into the darkest corner of the great mow.\n\n\"Help! Treason! Murder! Thieves!\"\n\nWith his hand on the host's throat, Phil shoved him deeper in the hay\nand held him at his mercy, but Martin was already scrambling over the\nmow, and with a last thrust Phil left the blinded and choking host to\ndig himself out at his leisure and followed, dirk in hand. As the two\nleaped down on the stable floor, the flashing dirk bought them passage\nto the rear, whither they fled apace, and out the door and away.\n\nThey passed Nell Entick at the gate, her hands clasped in terror, who\ncried to Martin, \"He'll have nought of you. Hard words were all he\nsent.\"\n\nTo Phil she said nothing but her glance held him, and he whispered, \"I\nwill come back and marry you.\"\n\nShe smiled.\n\n\"You will wait for me?\" he whispered, and kissed her.\n\nShe nodded and he kissed her again ere he fled after Martin.\n\nWhen they had left the village behind them they stopped to breathe and\nrest.\n\nLeaning against a tree, Martin mopped the sweat from his brow. \"Had\nI but a sword,\" he cried, \"I'd ha' given them theme for thought, the\nscurvy knaves!\"\n\n\"It seems thy brother, of whom we were to have got so much, bears thee\nlittle love.\" And Phil smiled.\n\nFor this Martin returned him an oath, and sat upon a stone.\n\nOn the left lay the village whence they had come, and, though the sun\nwas not yet up, the spire of the church and the thatched roofs of the\ncottages were very clearly to be seen in the pure morning air. Smoke\nwas rising from chimneys and small sounds of awakening life came out to\nthe vagabonds on the lonely road, as from the woods at their back came\nthe shrill, loud laugh of the yaffle, and from the marsh before them,\nthe croaking of many frogs.\n\nMartin's shifty eyes ranged from the cows standing about the straw rack\nin a distant barton in the east to a great wooded park on a hill in the\nwest. \"I will not go hungry,\" he cried with an oath, \"because it is his\nhumour to deny me. We shall see what we shall see.\"\n\nHe rose and turned west and with Phil at his heels he came presently to\nthe great park they had seen from a distance.\n\n\"We shall see what we shall see.\"\n\nWith that he left the road and following a copse beside a meadow\nentered the wood, where the two buried themselves deep in the shade\nof the great trees. The sun was up now and the birds were fluttering\nand clamouring high overhead, but to the motion and clamour of small\nbirds they gave no heed. From his pocket Martin drew a bit of strong\nthread, then, looking about, he wagged his head and pushed through the\nundergrowth. \"Hare or pheasant, I care not which. Here we shall spread\nour net--here--and here.\" Whereupon he pulled down a twig and knotted\nthe thread and formed a noose with his fingers. \"Here puss shall run,\"\nhe continued, \"and here, God willing, we shall eat.\"\n\nHaving thus set his snare, he left it, and sulkily, for the sun was\ngetting up in the sky and they had come far without breaking their\nfast. So Phil followed him and they lay on a bank, with an open vale\nbefore them where yellow daffodils were in full bloom, and nursed their\nhunger.\n\nAfter a while Martin slipped away deftly but returned with a face\ndarker than he took, and though he went three times to the snare and\nscarcely stirred a leaf,--which spoke more of experience in such\nlawless sports than some books might have told,--each time his face,\nwhen he returned, was longer than before.\n\n\"A man must eat,\" he said at last, \"and here in his own bailiwick and\nwarren will I eat to spite him. Yea, and leave guts and fur to puzzle\nhim. But there's another way, quicker and surer, though not so safe.\"\n\nSo they went together over a hill and down a glade to a meadow.\n\n\"Do thou,\" he whispered, \"lie here in wait.\"\n\nWith a club in his hand and a few stones in his pocket he circled\nthrough the thicket, and having in his manner of knowing his business\nand of commanding the hunt, resumed his old bravado, he now made a\ngreat show of courage and resourcefulness; but Phil, having flung\nhimself down at full length by the meadow, smiled to hear him puffing\nthrough the wood.\n\nOff in the wood wings fluttered and Martin murmured under his breath.\nPresently a stone rapped against a tree-trunk and again there was the\nsound of wings.\n\nThen the lad by the meadow heard a stone rip through the leaves and\nstrike with a soft thud, whereupon something fell heavily and thrashed\nabout in the undergrowth, and Martin cried out joyously.\n\nHe had no more than appeared, holding high a fine cock-pheasant, with\nthe cry, \"Here's meat that will eat well,\" when there was a great noise\nof heavy feet in the copse behind him, and whirling about in exceeding\nhaste, he flung the pheasant full in the face of the keeper and bolted\nlike a startled filly. Thereupon scrambling to his feet, Phil must\nneeds burst out laughing at the wild look of terror Martin wore, though\nthe keeper was even then upon him and though he himself was of no mind\nto run. He lightly stepped aside as the keeper rushed at him, and\ndarting back to where Martin had dropped his cudgel, snatched it up\nand turned, cudgel in hand. He was aware of a flash of colour in the\nwood, and the sound of voices, but he had no leisure to look ere the\nkeeper was again at him, when for the first time he saw that the keeper\nwas the selfsame red-faced countryman who had brought the gun to Moll\nStevens's alehouse by the Thames--that it was Jamie Barwick.\n\nNow the keeper Barwick was at the same moment aware of something\nfamiliar about his antagonist, but not until he was at him a second\ntime in full tilt did he recollect where and when he had last seen him.\nHe then stopped short, so great was his amazement, but resumed his\nattack with redoubled fury. His stick crashed against the cudgel and\nbroke, and ducking a smart rap, he dived at Phil's knees.\n\nTo this, Phil made effective reply by dropping the cudgel and dodging\npast the keeper to catch him round the waist from behind (for his arms,\nexceeding long though they were, were just long enough to encompass\ncomfortably the man's great belly), and the lad's iron clutch about the\nfellow's middle sorely distressed him. As they swayed back and forth\nthe keeper suddenly seized Phil's head over his own shoulder and rose\nand bent forward, lifting Phil from the ground bodily; then he flung\nhimself upon his back and might have killed the lad by the fall, had\nPhil not barely wriggled from under him.\n\nBoth were on their feet in haste, but though the keeper was breathing\nthe harder, Philip Marsham, having come far without food, was the\nweaker, and as Barwick charged again, Phil laid hands on his dirk, but\nthought better of it. Then Barwick struck from the shoulder and Phil,\nseizing his wrist, lightly turned and crouched and drew the man just\nbeyond his balance so that his own great weight pitched him over the\nlad's head. It is a deft throw and gives a heavy fall, but Phil had not\nthe strength to rise at the moment of pitching his antagonist,--which\nwill send a man flying twice his length,--so Barwick, instead of taking\nsuch a tumble as breaks bones, landed on his face and scraped his nose\non the ground.\n\nHe rose with blood and mud smearing his face and with his drawn knife\nin his hand; and Philip Marsham, his eyes showing like black coals set\nin his stark white face, yielded not a step, but snatched out his dirk\nto give as good as he got.\n\nThen, as they shifted ground and fenced for an opening, a booming\n\"Holla! Holla!\" came down to them.\n\nThey stopped and looked toward the source of the summons, but Phil, a\nshade the slower to return to his antagonist, saw out of the corner of\nhis eye that Barwick was coming at him. He leaped back and with his arm\nknocked aside Barwick's blow.\n\n\"Holla, I say! Ha' done, ha' done! That, Barwick, was a foul trick.\nAnother like that, and I'll turn you out.\"\n\nA crestfallen man was Barwick then, who made out to stammer, \"Yea, Sir\nJohn--yea, Sir John, but a poacher--'e's a poacher, Sir John, and a\npoacher--\"\n\n\"A foul trick is a foul trick.\"\n\nThe speaker wore a scarlet cloak overlaid with silver lace, and his\niron-grey hair crept in curls from under a broad hat. His face, when he\nlooked at Barwick, was such that Barwick stepped quietly back and held\nhis tongue. The man had Martin by the collar (his sleek impudence had\nmelted into a vast melancholy), and there stood behind them a little\nway up the bank, Phil now saw, a lady no older than Phil himself, who\nwatched the group with calm, dark eyes and stood above them all like a\nqueen.\n\n\"Throw down those knives,\" the knight ordered, for it took no divining\nto perceive that here was Sir John Bristol in the flesh. \"Thrust them,\npoints into the ground. Good! Now have on, and God speed the better\nman.\"\n\nTo Philip Marsham, who could have expected prison at the very least,\nthis fair chance to fight his own battle came as a reprieve; and though\nhe very well knew that he must win the fight at once or go down from\nsheer weakness and want of food, his eyes danced.\n\nThe knight's frown darkened, observing that Barwick appeared to have\ngot his fill, and he smote the ground with his staff. Then Barwick\nturned and Philip Marsham went in upon him like a ray of light. Three\ntimes he threw the big man, by sheer skill and knowledge, for the other\nby his own weight hindered himself, but after the third time the world\nwent white and the lad fell.\n\nHe sat up shortly and looked into Sir John's face.\n\n\"'Tis the lack of food,\" he stammered, \"or I'd out-last him as well as\nout-wrestle him.\"\n\nSir John was laughing mightily. \"You gave him full measure, and thank\nGod you are fresh from a fast or I'd ha' lost a keeper. As for food, we\nshall remedy that lack. Two things I have to say: one to you, Barwick.\nYou attempted a foul trick. I'll have none such in my service. If it\nhappens again, you go. And as for you, you white-livered cur, that\nwould leave a boy to a beating and never turn a hand to save him, I'll\neven take you in hand myself.\"\n\nAnd with that, Sir John flung back his cloak and raising his staff with\none hand while with the other he kept hold of Martin's coat-collar,\nhe thrashed the man till he bellowed and blubbered--till his coat was\nsplit and his shirt was bloody and his head was broken and his legs\nwere all welts and bruises.\n\n\"Help! Help! O Holy Mary! Saints in Heaven! Help! O Jamie, Jamie,\nJamie! O sir! Kind sir! let me go! Let me go!\"\n\nSir John flung him away with a last whistling stroke of the great\nstaff. \"That,\" said he, \"for cowardice.\"\n\nAnd Jamie Barwick, having already forgotten his own rebuke, was broadly\nsmiling.\n\nSir John turned then and looked Philip Marsham in the eye. \"It was a\ngood fight,\" he said, and smiled. \"Courage and honour will carry a man\nfar.\"\n\nHe then looked away across his wide acres to the distant village. For a\nwhile he was lost in revery and the others waited for him, but he came\nto himself with a start and turned brusquely, though not unkindly, to\nPhilip Marsham.\n\n\"Come now, begone, you vagabond cockerel! If a farm is robbed from\nhere to the Channel, or a hundred miles the other way, I'll rear the\ncounty upon your track and scour the countryside from the Severn to\nthe Thames. I'll publish the tale of you the country over and see you\nhanged when they net you.\"\n\nHe stood there looking very fierce as he spoke, but there was a laugh\nin his eyes, and when Phil turned to go, he flung the lad a silver coin.\n\nPhil saw the gesture and picked the money from the air, for he was\nquick with his fingers, but before he caught it Sir John seemed to have\nforgotten him; for he bent his head and walked away with his eyes on\nthe ground. There was something in the knight's manner that stung the\nlad, who looked at the coin in his hand and almost as quick as thought\nhurled it back at Sir John.\n\n\"How now?\" cried Sir John, turning about.\n\n\"I'll take no money that is thrown me,\" Phil replied.\n\n\"So!\" Sir John stood looking at him. \"I have a liking for thee,\" he\nsaid, and smiled. But he then, it seemed, again forgot that there was\nsuch a lad, for he once more bent his head and walked away with the\nlady who had stood above them in the wood.\n\nAs for Phil, he did not so lightly forget Sir John. He watched him\nuntil he had fixed in his mind every line of his tall, broad figure,\nevery gesture of his hand and every toss of his head. He then walked\noff, and when he turned to look back a last time Sir John was gone.\n\n\"What was that he said of hanging?\" Martin whispered.\n\nThe fellow's face was so white and his lips and his bruises were so\nblue that Phil laughed at him before his eyes, who thereupon lost his\ntemper and snarled, \"It's all well enough to take things lightly, you\nwho got no beating; but hanging is no laughing matter.\"\n\nHe then looked cautiously around and ran back the way they had come.\nWhen he returned he held between thumb and forefinger the silver coin\nPhil had thrown back at the burly knight. Martin bought food with it\nand Phil, though he thought it would have choked him, helped him eat\nit; and so they survived the day.\n\n\"That keeper, Barwick,\" Martin said that evening as the two tramped\nwest along the highway, \"is my brother, and an ungrateful wretch he is.\"\n\n\"I knew he was your brother,\" Phil said. But he was not thinking of\nMartin or his brother. He was thinking of the old knight in the scarlet\ncloak so bravely decked with silver lace. There was only one man Philip\nMarsham had ever known, who had such a rough, just, heavy-handed humour\nas Sir John Bristol or any such indomitable sense of fair play, and\nthat man was Phil's dead father.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nTHE ROSE OF DEVON\n\n\nThey came to Bristol over the hills that lie to the south of the town.\nThey had lost time on the way and had grown weary and sore of foot; and\nfinding at last that there was little hope of overtaking at Bideford\nthe thin man with whom they had parted on the road, they had turned\nnorth in Somerset at the end of Polton Hill. They passed first across\na lonely waste where for miles the only human being they saw was an\naged man gathering faggots; then over the Mendip Hills and through\nrough valleys and rougher uplands, and so at last to the height whence\nBristol and Avon Valley and Bristol Channel in the east lie spread in a\nvast panorama.\n\nFar away in Hungroad and Kingroad ships were anchored, but the vessels\nat the wharves of Bristol lay with their keels in mud, for the tide was\nout and the tides of Bristol, as all know, have a wonderful great flow\nand ebb.\n\nThe two went on into the town, where there were seafaring men standing\nabout and talking of ships, which gave Phil Marsham a feeling of being\nonce more at home after his inland travels; and passing this one tavern\nand another, they came to a square where there was a whipping-post and\na stocks, and a man in the stocks.\n\nNow a man in stocks was a pleasing sight to Phil, for he was not so old\nthat he missed the humour of it, and he paused to grin at the unlucky\nwight who bore with ill grace the jeers of the urchins that had\nassembled to do him honour; but when Martin saw the fellow he looked a\nsecond time and turned very hastily round. Straightway seizing Phil by\nthe arm he whispered hoarsely, \"Come now, we must hie us away again,\nand that speedily.\"\n\n\"Why in so great haste?\" Phil returned. \"Here is a pleasant jest. Let\nus stay a while. Who knows but some day we may ourselves sit in the\nbilboes and yonder ballad-maker may take his fill of pleasure at our\nmisfortune. Why, then, turn about is fair play. Let us enjoy his while\nthere's time.\" And he waited with quiet glee for Martin's angry reply.\n\n\"Fool!\" Martin whispered. \"Stay and be hanged, an thou wilt.\"\n\nThereupon Martin posted in all haste back the way he had come and Phil,\nof no mind to be left now, since they had journeyed together thus far,\nfollowed at his heels with a curiosity that he was intent on satisfying.\n\n\"'Sin,' according to the proverb,\" he called after Martin, \"'begins\nwith an itch and ends with a scar,' but methinks thy scars, which are\nnumerous, are all an-itch.\"\n\n\"Hist, fool,\" Martin snarled. \"Be still! For ha'pence I'd slit thy\nthroat to still thy tongue. I swear I can already feel the hemp at my\nweasand. It burns and spreads like a tetter.\" And he made haste up out\nof the town till despite his great weight and short wind he had Phil\npuffing at his heels.\n\n\"This is queer talk of ropes and hangings. It buzzeth through thy\nnoddle like bees in clover. In faith, though thy folly be great, yet it\nsorely presses upon thee, for I have seldom seen a man walk faster. Yet\nat thine ordinary gait a tin-pedlar's broken-down jade can set a pace\ntoo fast for thee to follow.\"\n\n\"Yea, laugh at me! Wouldst thou stay for sugared pills of pleasure with\nthe hangman at thy heels?\"\n\n\"What has a poor devil in stocks to do with the hangman, prithee? And\nwhy this fierce haste?\"\n\n\"Th' art no better than a gooseling--fit for tavern quarrels. And did\nyou never see a man dance on air? 'Tis a sight to catch the breath in\nthe throat and make an emptiness in a man's belly.\"\n\n\"There be no hangings without reason.\"\n\n\"Reason? Law, logic, and the Switzers can be hired to fight for any\nman, they say. 'Tis true, in any event, of the law. I've seen the\nlearned men in wigs wringing a poor man's withers and shaping the\nhalter to his neck.\"\n\nThey had talked breathlessly at long intervals in their hasty flight,\nand thus talking they had come out of the town and up from the valley;\nnor would Martin stay to rest till from the southern hill that had\ngiven them their first prospect of Bristol city they looked back upon\nthe houses and the river and the ships. Martin breathed more easily\nthen and mopped his forehead and sat down until his wildly beating\nheart was quieter.\n\n\"To Bideford we must go, after all,\" said he, \"and 'twere better by far\nhad we never turned from the straight road.\"\n\n\"I am of no mind to go farther,\" Phil replied, looking back. \"There\nwill be more vessels sailing out of Bristol than out of Bideford. A man\ncan choose in which to go.\"\n\nMartin gulped and rubbed his throat. \"Nay, I'll not hear to it. Daniel\nwent but once into the lion's den.\"\n\nHe sighed mightily as he thought of begging his long way through\nSomerset and Devon, for he was a big heavy man and lazy and short of\nwind; but he would not go back, though he refused to speak further of\nhis reason for it; and Phil, though in truth he liked Martin little,\nwas too easy-going to part thus with his companion of the road. The lad\nwas young, and the world was wide, and it was still spring in England.\n\nSo they turned toward the hills, which were blue and purple in the\nsetting sun,--a shepherd, did he but know it, lives in halls more\nsplendid than a king's,--and set forth upon their journey through the\nrough lands of Somerset. They went astray among the mines but found\ntheir way to Wells where, as they came out from the town, they passed\na gallows, which gave Martin such a start that he stopped for neither\nbreath nor speech until he had left that significant emblem of the law\na mile behind him. They went through Glastonbury, where report has it\nthat Joseph of Arimathea and King Arthur and King Edgar lie buried,\nand through Bridgewater, where to their wonder there was a ship of a\nhundred tons riding in the Parret. They went through Dulverton on a\nmarket day, and crossed the Dunsbrook by the stone bridge and so passed\ninto Devon. They went on over heath and hill and through woods and\ngreen valleys until at the end of seven days from Bristol--for time and\nagain they had lost their way, and a sailor on shore is at best like a\nlame horse on a rough road--they crossed the Taw at Barnstable. Again\ngoing astray, they went nearly to Torrington before they learned their\nblunder and turned down the valley of the Torridge. But all things\ncome to an end at last, and one pleasant evening they crossed the\nancient bridge built on stately Gothic arches into the populous town of\nBideford.\n\nAt the river front there lay a street the better part of a mile long,\nin which were the custom house and a great quay, and there they saw\nships of good burden loading and unloading in the very bosom of the\ntown, as the scribe hath it. Thither Phil would have gone straightly\nbut Martin shook his head. So turning up from the river, they passed\nanother long street, where the houses of wealthy merchants stood, and\nthis, too, Martin hastened quickly by. He shot glances to one side and\nthe other as if fearing lest he see faces that he knew, and led his\ncompanion by an obscure way, as night was falling, to a cottage whence\na dim light shone through a casement window.\n\nStanding on the rough doorstone under the outcropping thatch, which\nprojected beyond the line of the eaves to shield the door from rain, he\nsoftly knocked. There was no answer, no sound, but the door presently\nmoved ajar as if by its own will.\n\n\"Who knocks?\" an old woman whispered. \"'Tis that dark I cannot see thy\nface.\"\n\n\"'Tis thine eyes are ailing. Come, open the door and bid us enter.\"\n\n\"Thy voice hath a familiar ring but I know thee not. Who art thou?\"\n\n\"We be two honest men.\"\n\n\"Ah, two honest men? And what, prithee, are two honest men doing here?\"\n\n\"Yea, 'tis a fair thrust and bites both ways! Thou old shrew, dost bar\nthe door to Martin Barwick?\"\n\n\"So 'tis thou. I believe it even is. Enter then, ere the watch spy\nthee. Th' art a plain fool to stand here quibbling thus, though 'tis to\nbe expected, since thou wert ever quicker of thy tongue than thy wit.\nBut who's thy fellow?\"\n\n\"Nay, thou old shrew, open to us. He is to be one of us, though a\nLondon man by birth.\"\n\n\"One of us, say'st thou? Enter and welcome, then, young sir. Mother\nTaylor bids thee welcome. One of us? 'Tis the more pity so few of the\ngentlemen are left in port.\"\n\n\"The Old One?\"\n\n\"He hath sailed long since.\" She closed the door behind them, and the\nthree stood together in the dark passage. \"Hast money?\"\n\n\"Not a groat.\"\n\nShe sighed heavily. \"I shall be ruined. Seven o' the gentlemen ha'\nsailed owing me.\"\n\n\"Yea, thou old shrew, had I a half--nay, had I the tenth part of the\ngold thou hast taken from us and laid away wherever thy hiding-places\nare, I'd go no more to sea. But thou know'st what thou know'st, and\nthere's not one among us but will pay his score. The wonder is that of\nthem thou could'st hang by a word none has slit thy scrawny throat.\"\n\n\"Aye, they pay, they pay. And the gentlemen bear Mother Taylor nought\nbut love. How else could they do their business but for good Mother\nTaylor?\" She led them into a little back room where there was a fire\nand a singing kettle; and as she scuttled with a crooked, nimble gait\nfrom one window to another to make sure that every shutter was fast\nclosed, in her cracked old voice she bade them sit.\n\nTo his prudent companion, whose quick glance was marking every door\nand window,--for who knows when a man shall have need to leave in\nhaste a sailor's inn?--quoth Martin, \"The old witch is a rare hand to\nsell a cargo got--thou can'st guess well enough how; and the man who\nwould bring a waggon-load of spirits past the customs on a dark night\nor would bargain with a Dartmoor shepherd for wool secretly sheared,\ncan lay the matter before her and go his way, knowing she will do his\nbusiness better than he could do it himself. Yea, a man's honour and\nlife are safer with her than with any lord in England.\"\n\nShe showed by a grunt that she had heard him but otherwise paid no\nattention to what he said. She brought food from a cupboard and laid\nthe table by the fire, and going into a back room, she drew a foaming\npitcher of beer.\n\n\"No wine?\" cried Martin. \"Mother Taylor has no wine? Come, thou old\nbeldame, serve us a stronger tipple.\"\n\nShe laughed shrilly. \"The beer,\" said she, \"is from Frome-Selwood.\"\n\n\"Why, then, I must needs drink and say nought, since it is common\nreport that the gentry choose it, when well aged, rather than the wine\nof Portugal or France. But my heart was set on good wine or stronger\nspirits.\"\n\n\"He who sails on the morning tide must go sober to bed else he may rue\nhis choice. Aye, an' 'tis rare fine beer.\"\n\nHer old bent back fitted into her bent old chair. Her face settled into\na myriad wrinkles from which her crooked nose projected like a fish in\na bulging net. She was very old and very shrewd, and though there was\nsomething unspeakably hard in her small, cold eyes, Martin trusted her\nas thus far he had trusted no one they had met. Even to Phil she gave\nan odd sense of confidence in her complete loyalty.\n\nAt Phil she cast many glances, quick and sharp like a bird's, but she\nnever spoke to him nor he to her.\n\nIt was Martin who again spoke up, having blunted the edge of his\nhunger. \"And now, you old witch, who's in port and where shall we find\nthe softest berths? For you've made it plain that since trust us you\nmust, you will trust us little--that is to say, it is not in thy head\nthat our score shall mount high.\"\n\nShe chuckled down in her skinny old crop. \"Let us see. The Old One has\ngone and that's done. You were late.\"\n\n\"'Tis a long road and we went astray.\"\n\n\"There's the Nestor and the Essay. They will be off soon; the one to\nLiverpool for salt, t' other to Ireland for wool.\"\n\nMartin thereupon set down his pot of beer and significantly rubbed his\nthroat, at which the old woman cackled with shrill laughter. \"Aye, th'\nart o'er well known in Liverpool. Well, let us consider again. There's\nthe Rose of Devon, new come from Plymouth. I hear she's never touched\nat Bideford before and her master hails from Dorset.\"\n\n\"His name?\"\n\n\"'Tis Candle.\"\n\nMartin laughed boisterously. \"A bright and shining name! But I know him\nnot and will chance a singeing. What voyage does she make?\"\n\n\"She goeth to fetch cod from Newfoundland.\" The old woman saw him\nhesitate. \"A barren voyage, think'st thou? Nay, 'twere well for one of\nthe gentlemen to look into that trade. Who knows?\"\n\n\"True, old mother witch, who knows?\" Martin tapped the table. \"Can'st\narrange it?\"\n\n\"Nay. But I can start the wedge.\"\n\n\"We'll go,\" said Martin at last. \"But now for bed. We've been a weary\nwhile on the road.\"\n\nIt was a great bed in a small room under the thatch; and as they lay\nthere on the good goose-feathers in the dark, Martin said, \"We'll sail\nin this Rose of Devon, lad.\"\n\nPhil, already nearly asleep, stirred and roused up. \"Any port in a\nstorm,\" he mumbled. Then, becoming wider awake, he asked, \"What is all\nthis talk of 'the gentlemen' and who, prithee, is the Old One?\"\n\n\"Ah, a natural question.\" Though the room was dark as Egypt, Phil knew\nby Martin's voice--for he could recognize every inflection and change\nin tone--that the sly, crafty look was creeping over his fat, red face.\n\"Well,\" Martin continued after a moment of silence, \"by 'the gentlemen'\nshe means a few seafaring men that keep company together by custom and\nstop here when ashore--all fine, honest fellows as a man may be proud\nto know. I have hopes that some day you'll be one of us, Phil my lad,\nand some day I'll tell you more. As for the Old One, it very curiously\nhappens that you have met with him. Do you recall to mind the thin man\nI quarrelled with, that first day?\"\n\n\"Yea.\"\n\n\"That is the Old One, and Tom Jordan is his proper name.\"\n\nIt was Martin, after all, who fell asleep first, for Phil lay in the\ngreat bed in the small room, thinking of all that had happened since\nthe day he fled from Moll Stevens's alehouse. There was Colin Samson,\nwhose dirk he wore; there was the wild-eyed, black-haired man with the\ngreat book and the woeful tale; there were Martin, and Tom Jordan, \"the\nOld One\"; there were the inn and the old lady and gentleman--it all\nseemed so utterly unreal!--and Nell Entick, and Sir John Bristol. He\nfell asleep thinking of Nell and Sir John and dreamed of marrying Nell\nand keeping a tavern, to which the bluff old knight came in the guise\nof a very aged gentleman from Little Grimsby with a coachman who went\npoaching pheasants in the tavern yard.\n\nIt was early morning when Mother Taylor called them down to breakfast\nat a table burdened with good food such as they had not eaten for many\nlong days. She sat by the fire, a bent old woman in a round-backed\nlittle chair, watching them with keen small eyes while they ate, and\nsmiling in a way that set her wrinkles all a-quiver to see them empty\ndish after dish.\n\n\"Th' art a good old witch, Mother Taylor, though the Devil cry nay,\"\nsaid Martin. \"Though thy score be high never did'st thou grudge a man\nthe meat he ate.\"\n\n\"'Tis not for nought the gentlemen love Mother Taylor,\" she quavered.\n\"What can a woman do when her beauty's gone but hold a man by the food\nshe sets before him? 'Tis the secret of blessed marriage, Martin, and\nheaven send thee a wife as knows it like I!\"\n\n\"Beauty, thou old beldame! What did'st thou ever know of beauty? But\nbeauty is a matter of little moment. Hast thou prepared the way for us?\"\n\nShe laughed in shrill delight at his rough jesting. \"Aye, I ha' sent a\nmessenger. Seek out the Rose of Devon and do thy part, and all shall be\nwell.\"\n\n\"And whence does good Captain Candle expect his men?\"\n\n\"Say to Captain Candle that thou and this handsome young gentleman who\nsays so little are come from the Mersey, where thy vessel, the Pride o'\nLancashire, lies to be repaired, and that Master Stephen Gangley sent\nthee.\"\n\nShe looked at Phil, who had learned long before to hold his tongue in\nstrange places, and he smiled; but Martin laughed hoarsely. \"Th' art\nthe Devil's own daughter. And does this Master Stephen Gangley in all\ntruth dwell in Liverpool?\"\n\n\"Dost think my wits are wandering, Martin? Nay, I be old, but not so\nold as that. Go hastily through the town lest thou be seen and known.\nThou, of all the gentlemen, most needs make haste.\"\n\nThe two stopped just inside the door. \"You have chalked down the score\nagainst us?\"\n\nShe laughed in her skinny throat. \"I be old, but not so old as to\nforget the score. The gentlemen always pay.\"\n\nShe pushed Martin out and shut the door behind him, then, seizing Phil\nby the arm, she whispered, \"Leave him.\"\n\nMartin angrily thrust the door open again and she gave Phil a shove\nthat sent him stumbling over the threshold. The door slammed shut and\nthey heard the bolt slide.\n\n\"They pay,\" Martin muttered. \"Yea, they pay in full and the old witch\nhath got rich thereby, for 'tis pay or hang. So much does she know of\nall that goes on at sea! In faith, I sorely mistrust she is a witch in\nall earnest; but even be it so, a most useful witch.\"\n\nAs the two came into the town they saw at a distance a crowd gathering.\nDogs barked and boys shouted and men came running and laughing, which\nseemed to give promise of rare sport of one kind or another.\n\n\"See!\" cried Phil, catching Martin by the arm. \"Here's a game. Come,\nlet us join the cry.\"\n\n\"Thou art a very pattern of blockishness,\" quoth Martin. \"Would'st see\nus in pillory, egged, turnipped, nay, beaten at the post?\"\n\n\"Come, old frog, I for one will run the hazard.\"\n\n\"Old frog, is it?\" Martin's face flamed redder than before. \"An we\nloiter there'll be sharp eyes upon us. My very throat is itching at the\nthought. Justice is swift. Who knows but we'll swing by sundown? Hast\nnever considered the pains of hanging? The way they dance and twitch is\nenough to take the sap out of a man's legs.\"\n\nMartin's fears were an old story and the lad heeded them so little,\nsave when he would make game of them, that he never even smiled. \"See!\"\nhe cried. \"There's a man in their midst. Stay! Who is he? He is--yea,\nhe is the very one, come back to Bideford despite his fears. And it\nseems the townsfolk know him well.\"\n\nThe jeering mob parted and revealed a lank man with a great book. His\nvoice rose above their clamour, \"O well beloved, O well beloved, never\nwas a man perplexed with such diversity of thoughts!\"\n\nBut Martin was gone, and Phil hastening after him saw a face in a\nwindow, which was watching Martin hurry through the town. And when Phil\npursued Martin the eyes in the window scanned the lad from head to foot.\n\nThey found lying at the quay the vessel they sought, and a brave\nfrigate she was, with high poop and nobly carved fiddlehead and sharp,\ndeep cutwater. The gun-deck ports were closed, but on the main deck was\na great show of ordnance with new carriages and new yellow breechings.\nThere were swivel-guns on the forecastle and the quarter-deck and there\nwas a finely wrought lantern of bronze and glass at the stern. But as\nthey came up to her, a cloud hid the sun and the gilded carving ceased\nto shine and the bright colours lost their brilliance and her black,\nhigh sides loomed up sombrely, and to Phil she seemed for the moment\nvery dark and forbidding.\n\nOf this Martin appeared to have no perception, for he smiled and\nwhispered, \"Mother Taylor hath done well by us. This Rose of Devon is a\ntall ship and by all the signs she will be well found.\"\n\nThere were men standing about the capstan on the main deck and voices\ncame from the forecastle; but on the poop there leaned against the rail\nto watch the two come down the quay a single man, of an age in the\nmiddle-thirties, with a keen, strong face, who wore a good coat on his\nback and had the manner of a king in a small island.\n\nThey stepped under the poop and Martin doffed his hat, having assumed\nhis most ingratiating smile. \"An it please you, sir,\" said he, \"have I\nthe honour to address Captain Candle of the Rose of Devon frigate?\"\n\n\"I am Captain Candle.\"\n\n\"Good morrow to thee, sir, and Master Stephen Gangley of Liverpool sent\nus--\"\n\n\"Yea, I received his letter. I know him not, but it seems he knows\nfriends of mine. You are over heavy for a good seaman but your fellow\ntakes my eye.\"\n\nMartin stammered and flamed up with anger, and perceiving this, the\ncaptain smiled.\n\n\"Let it be,\" he said. \"I can make room for the two, and to judge by\nyour looks, if you are slow aloft at handling and hauling, we can use\nyou to excellent purpose as a cook. Of good food and plenty it is plain\nyou know the secret.\"\n\nHe watched policy contend with anger in Martin's face and his own\nexpression gave no hint of what went on in his mind; but there was that\nabout him which made Phil believe he was inwardly laughing, and Phil\nhad an instant liking for the man, which, if one might judge by the\ncaptain's glance or two, was returned.\n\n\"You may sign the articles in the tavern yonder,\" he said. \"You are\nnone too early, for we sail in an hour's time to get the tide.\"\n\nAs Phil followed Martin into the tavern he saw a bustle and flurry in\nthe street, but it passed and while they waited by the fire for the\ncaptain and the agent to come with the articles he thought no more of\nit.\n\nThey came at last, and other seamen with them, and spread the articles\non the oaken table where one man might sign after another. And when\nMartin's turn was come, he tried to speak of wages, but the captain\nnamed the figure and bade him sign, and before he thought, he had done\nso. He stood back, cursing under his breath, and when the captain named\na higher wage for Phil, Martin's cursing became an audible mumble,\nwhich drew from master and agent a sharp glance. Though Martin smiled\nand looked about as if to see whence the sound came, he deceived no one.\n\nThe men filed out of the tavern, walking soberly behind the master, and\nproceeded down the quay to their ship. Their feet clattered on the\ncobbles and they swung along at a rolling gait. Some were sober and\nsome were drunk; and some were merry and some were sad. Some eyed one\nanother with the curiosity that a man feels if he must sit, for months\nto come, at cheek and jowl with strangers; and some bent their eyes on\nthe ground as if ill at ease and uncertain of their own discretion in\nthus committing themselves to no one knew what adventures in distant\nseas and lands.\n\nThus they came to the ship, following at the master's heels, and thus\nthey filed on board, while Captain Candle stood at one side and looked\nthem over as they passed.\n\nTo a young fellow leaning over the waist one of the men called, \"Well\nmet, Will Canty!\"\n\nLooking up, Phil himself then caught the eye of a lad of his own years\nwho was returning the hail of a former shipmate, and since each of the\nyouths found something to his taste in the appearance of the other, on\nthe deck of the ship they joined company.\n\n\"You come late,\" said the one who had answered to the name of Will\nCanty. \"Unless I am much mistaken, you were not on board yesterday.\"\n\nHe was tall and slender and very straight, and he carried his head with\nan erectness that seemed at first glance to savour of vanity. His face,\ntoo, was of a sober cast and his expression restrained. Yet he seemed a\nlikable fellow, withal, and one whom a man could trust.\n\n\"I have not until now set foot on this deck,\" Phil replied. \"But\nhaving seen many vessels in my time, I venture that the Rose of Devon\nis a staunch ship, as Captain Candle, it is plain to see, is a proper\nmaster.\"\n\n\"Yea, both sayings are true. I know, for I have sailed before in this\nship with Captain Candle.\"\n\nAn order bawled from the quarter-deck caused a great stir, and for the\nmoment put an end to their talk, but they were to see more of each\nother.\n\nCasting off the moorings in answer to the word of command, the men\nsprang to the capstan. It was \"Heave, my bullies!\" and \"Pull, my hearts\nof gold!\" Some, in a boat, carried out an anchor and others laboured\nat the capstan. The old frigate stirred uneasily and slipped away from\nthe wharf, rolling slightly with the motion of the sea, and thus they\nkedged her into the tide.\n\n\"Bend your passeree to the mainsail!\"\n\nBack came a roaring chorus, \"Yea, yea!\"\n\n\"Get your sails to the yards there--about your gear on all hands!\"\n\n\"Yea, yea!\" men here and there replied.\n\n\"Hoist sails half-mast high--make ready to set sail!\"\n\n\"Yea, yea!\"\n\n\"Cross your yards!\"\n\n\"Yea, yea!\"\n\n\"Bring the cable to the capstan--Boatswain, fetch the anchor\naboard!--Break ground!--Up there, a hand to the foretop and loose the\nforetopsail!\"\n\n\"Yea, yea!\" And the first man to set foot on the ratlines was running\nup the rigging.\n\nIt was Philip Marsham, for to him the sea was home and there was no\nnight so dark he could not find his way about a ship. Nor did his\npromptness escape the sharp eye of Captain Candle.\n\nNow, while the captain stood with folded arms at the poop, his mate\ncried, \"Come, my hearts, heave up your anchor! Come one and all! Who\nsays _Amen_? O brave hearts, the anchor a-peak!\"\n\n\"Yea, yea!\"\n\n\"Heave out your topsails!--Haul your sheets!--Let fall your\nforesail!--You at the helm, there, steer steady before the wind!\"\n\nOn all the vessels in the harbour, and all along the quay and the\nstreets, men had stopped their work to see the Rose of Devon sail. But\nthough most of them stood idle and silent, there was a sudden flurry\non the quay where but now she had been lying, and two men burst out,\ncalling after her and waving their arms.\n\n\"'Tis the beadle and the constable,\" the men muttered. \"Who of us hath\ngot to sea to escape the law?\"\n\nThe mate turned to the master, but the master firmly shook his head.\n\"Come, seize the tide,\" he called. \"We will stay for no man.\"\n\n\"Heave out the foretopsail--heave out the main topsail--haul home your\ntopsail sheets!\"\n\nThe men aloft let the lesser sails fall; the men on deck sheeted them\nhome and hoisted them up. The mate kept bawling a multitude of orders:\n\"Haul in the cable there and coil it in small fakes! Haul the cat! A\nbitter! Belay! Luff, my man, luff! You, there, with the shank painter,\nmake fast your anchor!\"\n\nThen came the voice of the master, which always his mate echoed, \"Let\nfall your mainsail!\"\n\nAnd the echo, \"Let fall your mainsail!\"\n\n\"Yea, yea!\"\n\n\"On with your bonnets and drabblers!\"\n\nAnd again came the echo from the mate, \"On with your bonnets and\ndrabblers!\"\n\n\"Yea, yea!\"\n\nThe great guns ranged along the deck--each bound fast by its new\nbreechings--with their linstocks and sponges and ladles and rammers,\nmade no idle show of warlike strength. There was too often need to let\ntheir grim voices sound at bay, for those were wild, lawless days.\n\nSuch a ship as the Rose of Devon frigate, standing out for the open\nsea, is a sight the world no longer affords. Those ships are \"gone,\ngone, gone with lost Atlantis.\" Their lofty poops, their little\nbonaventure masts, their lateen sails aft, their high forecastles\nand tall bowsprits with the square spritsail flaunted before the\nfiddlehead, came down from an even earlier day; for the Rose of Devon\nhad been an ancient craft when King James died and King Charles\nsucceeded to the throne. But she was a fine tall ship and staunch\nnotwithstanding her years, and there was newly gilded carving on bow\nand stern and a new band of crimson ran her length. With her great\nsails spread she thrust her nose into the heavy swell that went rolling\nup the Bristol Channel, and nodding and curtseying to old Neptune, she\nentered upon his dominions.\n\nShe was, as I have said, a brave tall ship, yet, despite her gilded\ncarving and her band of crimson, her towering sides which were painted\nblack gave her a singularly dark appearance, and she put to sea like a\nshadow out of older days.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nTHE SHIP'S LIAR\n\n\nDeath by land is a sobering thing and works many changes; but to my\nthought death at sea is more terrible, for there is a vast loneliness,\nwith only a single ship in the midst of it, and an empty hammock for\ndays and weeks and even months, to keep a man in mind of what has\nhappened; and death at sea may work as many changes as death by land.\n\nNow the Rose of Devon was a week from England when a footrope parted\nand the boatswain pitched down, clutching at the great belly of the\nsail, and plunged out of sight. And what could a man do to save him?\nThey never saw him after that first wild plunge. There, aloft, was the\nparted rope, its ends frayed out and hanging. Below decks was the empty\nberth. The blustering old boatswain, with his great roaring voice and\nhis quick ear for a tune, had gone upon the ultimate adventure which\nall must face, each man for himself; but they only said, \"Did you see\nthe wild look in his eyes when he fell?\" And, \"I fear we shall hear his\npipe of nights.\" And, \"'Tis a queer thought that Neddie Hart is to lie\nin old Davy Jones's palace, with the queer sea-women all about him,\nawaiting for his old shipmates.\"\n\nPresently the master's boy came forward into the forecastle, where the\nmen off duty were sitting and talking of the one who had fallen so\nfar, had sunk so deep, had gone on a journey so long that they should\nnever see him again; and quietly--for the boy was much bedevilled and\ntrembled with fright to think of putting his head, as it were, into the\nmouth of the lion--he crept behind Philip Marsham and whispered in his\near, \"The master would see thee in the great cabin.\"\n\nThey sat at close quarters in the forecastle of the Rose of Devon, and\nthe boy had barely room to pass the table and the benches, for the\nmen had crowded in and put their heads together; but for once they\nwere too intent on their own thoughts to heed his coming or his going,\nwhich gave him vast comfort. (Little enough comfort the poor devil got,\nbetween the men forward and the officers aft!)\n\nSo Phil rose and followed.\n\nThe great cabin, when he entered, was empty. He stood at loss, waiting,\nbut curiously observed meanwhile the rich hangings and the deep chairs\nand the cupboards filled with porcelain ware. There was plate on the\ncabin table and a rich cloak lay thrown loosely over a chair; and he\nthought to himself that those deep-sea captains lived like princes, as\nindeed they did.\n\nHe shifted his weight from foot to foot in growing uneasiness. The boy\nhad disappeared. There was no sound of voice or step. Then, as the ship\nrolled and Phil put out a foot to brace himself, a door swung open and\nrevealed on the old-fashioned walk that ran across the stem under the\npoop, the lean, big-boned figure of Captain Francis Candle.\n\nThe master of the Rose of Devon stood with folded arms and bent head,\nbut though his head was bent, his eyes, the lad could see, were peering\nfrom under his heavy brows at the horizon. He swayed as the ship\nrolled, and remained intent on his thoughts, which so absorbed him that\nhe had quite forgotten sending the boy for Philip Marsham.\n\nSo Phil waited; and the broad hat that hung on the bulkhead scraped\nbackward and forward as the ship plunged into the trough and rose on\nthe swell; and Captain Candle remained intent on his thoughts; and a\nsea bird circled over the wake of the ship.\n\nAfter a long time the master turned about and walked into the cabin\nand, there espying Philip Marsham, he smiled and said, \"I was remiss. I\nhad forgotten you.\" He threw aside the cloak that lay on the chair and\nsat down.\n\n\"Sit you down,\" he said with a nod. \"You are a practised seaman, no\nlame, decrepit fellow who serves for underwages. Have you mastered the\ntheory?\"\n\n\"Why, sir, I am not unacquainted with astrolabe and quadrant, and on\nscales and tables I have spent much labour.\"\n\n\"So!\" And his manner showed surprise. Then, \"Inkpot and quill are\nbefore you. Choose a fair sheet and put down thereon the problem I\nshall set you.\"\n\nThe captain leaned back and half closed his eyes while Phil spread the\npaper and dipped the quill.\n\n\"Let us say,\" he finally continued, \"that two ships sail from one port.\nThe first sails south-south-west a certain distance; then altering\nher course, she sails due west ninety-two leagues. The second ship,\nhaving sailed six-score leagues, meets with the first ship. I demand\nthe second ship's course and rhomb, and how many leagues the first ship\nsailed south-south-west. Now, my man, how go you to work?\"\n\nPhil studied the problem as he had set it down, and wrinkled his brows\nover it, while Captain Candle lay back with a flicker of a smile on his\nlips and watched the lad struggle with his thoughts.\n\nAfter a time Phil raised his head. \"First, sir,\" said he, \"I shall\ndraw the first ship's rhomb thus, from A unto E, which shall be\nsouth-south-west. Then I shall lay a line from A unto C as the ninety\nleagues that she sailed west. Next I shall lay my line from C to D, and\nfurther, as her south-west course. Then I shall lay from A a line that\nshall correspond to the six-score leagues the second ship sailed, which\ncuts at D the line I drew before.\" As he talked, he worked with his\npen, and the master, rising as if in surprise, bent over the table and\nwatched every motion.\n\nThe pen drew lines and arcs and lettered them and wrote out a problem\nin proportions. Hesitating, the point crawled over columns of figures.\n\n\"The rhomb of the second ship,\" said Phil at last, \"is degrees\nsixty-seven, and minutes thirty-six. Her course is near\nwest-south-west. And the first ship sailed forty-nine leagues.\"\n\nTapping the table, as one does who meditates, Captain Candle looked\nmore sharply at the lad. \"You are clever with your pen.\"\n\n\"'Tis owing to the good Dr. Arber at Roehampton,\" Phil replied. \"Had I\nabode with him longer, I had been cleverer still, for he was an able\nscholar; but there was much in school I had no taste for.\"\n\nThe captain's eyes searched his face. \"I sent for you,\" he said,\n\"because I was minded to make you my boatswain. But now, if my mate\nwere lost, I swear I'd seat you at mine own table.\"\n\nPhil rose.\n\n\"Go then, Master Boatswain. But stay! You and your comerado make a\nstrange pair. How came you bedfellows?\"\n\n\"Why, sir, we met upon the road--\"\n\n\"Yea, not at sea! Not at sea! Enough is said. Begone, Master Boatswain,\nbegone!\"\n\n\"How now,\" cried Martin when Phil passed him on the deck. \"Art thou\ncalled before the mast?\" And he laughed till he shook.\n\n\"Nay, he hath made me his boatswain.\"\n\n\"Thou?\"\n\n\"Yea, comerado.\"\n\n\"Thou? A mere gooseling? The master's on the road to Bedlam! Why here\nam I--\" Martin's red face flamed hot.\n\n\"Yea, he spoke of thee.\"\n\n\"Ah!\"\n\n\"Quoth he, thou art a fine fellow, but hot-tempered, Martin, and\noverbold.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" The crafty, sly look came upon Martin's face and he puffed with\npride; but Phil, delighting to see the jest take effect, laughed before\nhis eyes, which sorely perplexed him.\n\n\"A fine fellow, but overbold,\" Martin muttered, as he coiled the cable\nin neat fakes. \"Yea, I did not believe he thought so well of me. From\nthe glances he hath bestowed upon me, it was in my mind he was a narrow\nman,--\" Martin smiled and dallied over his work,--\"one with no eye for\na mariner of parts and skill. 'A fine fellow, but overbold!' Nay, that\nis fair speech and it seems he hath a very searching observation.\"\n\nStanding erect, Martin folded his arms and swelled like a turkey-cock.\nHis eyes being on the horizon and his back toward the watchful mate, he\nremained unaware that he had attracted the mate's attention.\n\n\"A fine fellow, but overbold,\" he repeated and smiled with a very\nhaughty air.\n\nThe mate, casting his eyes about the deck, picked up a handy end of\nrope and made a knot in it. One man and another and another became\naware of the play that the mate and Martin were about to set and,\ngrinning hugely, they paused in their work to watch, even though they\nrisked getting themselves into such a plight as Martin's. The captain\ncame to the break of the quarter-deck and, perceiving the fun afoot,\nleaned on the swivel-gun. Slowly his humour mastered his dignity and a\nsmile twitched at his lips.\n\n\"A fine fellow, but overbold,\" Martin was murmuring for the fourth\ntime, when the rope whistled and wound about his ribs and the knot\nfetched up on his belly with a thump that knocked his wind clean out.\n\nHe made a horrible face, gasping for breath, and his ruddy colour\ndarkened to purple. Reaching for his knife he whirled round and drew\nsteel.\n\n\"What rakehell muckworm, what base stinkard, what--\" He met the cold\neye of the mate and for a moment flinched, then, burning with his\nown folly, he cried, \"Thou villain, to strike thus a man the captain\nhimself called a fine fellow but overbold!\"\n\nA snicker grew in the silence and swelled into a rumble of laughter;\nthen, by the forecastle bulkhead, a man began to bawl, \"A liar! A liar!\"\n\nThe mate stopped short and his hand fell.\n\nA score of voices took up the cry--\"A liar! A liar!\"--and Martin turned\npale.\n\nCaptain Candle on the quarter-deck was laughing softly and the mate in\nglee slapped his thigh. \"Thou yerking, firking, jerking tinker,\" said\nhe, \"dost hear the cry? 'Tis a Monday morning and they are crying thee\nat the mainmast.\"\n\n\"A liar! A liar!\" the men bawled, crowding close about.\n\n\"But 'tis no lie. Or this foully deceitful comerado, this half-fledged\nboatswain--\" It came suddenly upon Martin that he had been sorely\ngulled, and that to reveal the truth would fix upon him the lasting\nridicule of his shipmates. He swelled in fury and gave them angry\nglances but they only laughed the louder, then, rope in hand, the mate\nstepped toward him.\n\nThough he made a motion as if to stand his ground, at sight of the rope\nMartin's hand shook in his haste to thrust his knife back into the\nsheath.\n\nIt was the old custom of the sea that they should hail as a liar the\nman first caught in a lie on a Monday morning and proclaim him thus\nfrom the mainmast, and unhappy was the man thus hailed, for thereby\nhe became for a week the \"ship's liar\" and held his place under the\nswabber.\n\n\"For seven days, thou old cozzener,\" said the mate, \"thou shalt keep\nclean the beakhead and the chains, and lucky art thou to be at sea.\nAshore they would have whipped thee through the streets at the cart's\ntail.\"\n\nAgain a great wave of laughter swept the deck and by his face Martin\nshowed his anger. But though he was \"a fine fellow\" and \"overbold,\" he\nkept his tongue between his teeth; and whatever he suspected of Philip\nMarsham, he held his peace and went over the bow with ill grace and\nfell to scraping the chains, which was a task to humble the tallest\npride. There was that in the laughter of the crew which had taught\ndiscretion to even bolder men than Martin Barwick.\n\n\"I have seen his kind before,\" a voice said low in Phil's ear. \"But\nthough there be much of the calf in him, beware lest you rouse him to\nsuch a pitch that he will draw and strike.\"\n\nIt was Will Canty, the youth who had already won the young boatswain's\nliking, spoke thus. He was a comerado more to Phil's taste than was\nthe luckless Martin; but fate is not given to consulting tastes, and\nnecessity forces upon a traveller such bedfellows as he meets by the\nway.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nSTORM\n\n\nThe storm brewed long in gray banks of cloud that hung in the west and\nnorth. It drew around the Rose of Devon from north to east with a slow,\nimmutable force, as yet perceived rather than felt, till she sailed in\nthe midst of a circle of haze. At night the moon was ringed. The sun\nrose in a bank of flaming red and the small sea-birds that by their\npresence, mariners say, tell of coming gales, played over the wake.\n\nCaptain Candle from the poop sniffed at the damp air: and studying\nthe winds as they veered and rose in brisk flourishes and fell to the\nmerest whisper of a breeze, he puckered his lips, which was his way\nwhen thoughts crowded upon him. Martin on the beakhead pursued his\nnoisome task of cleaning it under the watchful eye of the swabber\n(who took unkind joy in exacting from him the utmost pains), and cast\nfurtive glances at the gray swell that came shouldering up from the\neast.\n\n\"Holla, boatswain,\" the captain cried.\n\n\"Yea, yea!\"\n\n\"Our foresail is old and hath lost its goodness. Look to thy stores and\nsee if there be not another. Have it ready, then, to bend in haste if\nthere be need.\"\n\n\"Yea, yea!\"\n\n\"And lay out thy cordage, boatswain, that if sheet or halyard or\ntackling shall part, we may be ready to bend another in its place.\"\n\nDescending thereupon into the forehold with his boatswain's mate to\nfetch and carry, Boatswain Marsham fell to work overhauling the bolts\nof sail-cloth and the hanks of cordage and the coils of rope, till he\nhad found a new foresail and laid it under the hatch, and had placed\ngreat ropes and such cordage as headlines and marlines and sennets so\nthat a man could lay hands on them in a time of haste and confusion.\nFor the Rose of Devon was heavily pitching and the seas crashed on her\nthree-inch planks with a noise like thunderclaps; and when she lifted\non the swell, the water rumbled against her bilge and gurgled away past\nher run.\n\nVery faintly he heard a sailor's voice, \"The pump is choked.\" There\nwas shouting above for a time, then the cry arose, which brought\nreassurance to all, \"Now she sucks,\" and again there was quiet.\n\nClimbing through the hatch and passing aft along the main deck, he\nheard for himself the _suck-suck_ from the pump well, then the rattle\nof tiller and creak of pintle as the helmsmen eased her off and brought\nher on to meet a rising sea.\n\n\"Holla, master!\"\n\n\"Holla, is all laid ready below?\"\n\n\"Yea! Ropes and cordage and sail are laid ready upon the main deck and\nsecured against the storm.\"\n\n\"And seemeth she staunch to one in the hold?\"\n\n\"Yea, master.\"\n\n\"Then, boatswain, call up the men to prayer and breakfast, for we shall\ndoubtless have need of both ere the day is done. Boy, fetch my cellar\nof bottles, for I would drink a health to all, fore and aft, and I\nwould have the men served out each a little sack.\"\n\nBy midday the veering winds had settled in the east and the overcast\nsky had still further darkened. The ship, labouring heavily, held her\ncourse; but as the wind blew up a fresh gale, the after sails took the\nwind from the sails forward, which began to beat and thresh. Swarming\naloft, the younkers handed the fore-topsail-steering-sail, the fore and\nmain topsails, and the main-topsail-staysail. But as they manned the\nforeyard, the ship yawed in such a manner that the full force of the\nwind struck the old foresail and split it under their fingers.\n\nPhilip Marsham on the weather yardarm, with the grey seas breaking in\nfoam beneath him at one minute and with the forecastle itself seeming\nto rise up at him the next minute, so heavily did the old ship roll,\nwas reaching for the sail at the moment it tore to ribands; and a\nbillow of grey canvas striking him in the face knocked him off the\nyard; but as he fell, he locked his legs round the spar and got finger\nhold on the earing, and crawled back to the mast as the sailors stood\nby the ropes to strike the yard and get in the threshing tatters of the\nsail.\n\nThe mate, going aft, was caught in the waist when the ship gave a\nmighty lurch, and went tumbling to lee-ward where the scupper-holes\nwere spouting like so many fountains all a-row. The fall might well\nhave ended his days, had he not bumped into the capstan where he clung\nfast with both arms, and twice lucky he was to stay his fall thus, for\na sea came roaring over the waist and drowned the fountains in the\nscuppers and in a trice the decks were a-wash from forecastle to poop.\nBut the old ship shook her head and righted and Captain Francis Candle,\nleaning against the wind, his cloak flapping in the gale and his hat\nhauled hard down over his eyes, descended from the poop and braced\nhimself in its lee.\n\n\"The wind blows frisking,\" the mate cried, scrambling up the ladder and\njoining the master.\n\n\"Yea, it is like to over-blow. She took a shrewd plunge but now. We\nshall further our voyage by striking every sail. Go thou, mate, and\nhave them secure the spritsail-yard, then take thy station on the\nforecastle.\"\n\nFor an hour or two the old Rose of Devon went plunging through the\nseas; and there was much loosing and lowering of sails. For a while,\nthen, the wind scanted so that there was hope the storm had passed, and\nduring the lull they bent and set the new foresail and must needs brace\nand veer and haul aft. But ere long the gale blew up amain, and in the\nlate afternoon Captain Candle, sniffing the breeze, called upon all to\nstand by and once more to hand both foresail and mainsail.\n\n\"Cast off the topsail sheets, clew garnets, leechlines and buntlines!\"\nThe order came thinly through the roar of the wind.\n\n\"Yea, yea!\" a shrill voice piped.\n\n\"Stand by the sheet and brace--come lower the yard and furl the\nsail--see that your main halyards be clear and all the rest of your\ngear clear and cast off.\"\n\n\"It is all clear.\"\n\n\"Lower the main yard--haul down upon your down-haul.\" As the yard\nswayed down and the men belayed the halyards, one minute staggering to\nkeep their feet, the next minute slipping and sliding across the decks,\nthe captain's sharp voice, holding them at their work, cut through the\ngale, \"Haul up the clew garnets, lifts, leechlines and buntlines!\nCome, furl the sail fast and secure the yard lest it traverse and gall!\"\n\n\"'Twas a fierce gust,\" an old sailor cried to Phil, who had reached\nfor the rigging and saved himself from going down to the lee scuppers.\n\"We best look the guns be all fast. I mind, in the Grace and Mary, my\nsecond Guinea voyage, a gun burst its breechings--\"\n\n\"Belay the fore down-haul!\" the mate thundered, and leaving his tale\nuntold, the old man went crawling forward.\n\nThe men heard faintly the orders to the helmsman, \"Hard\na-weather!--Right your helm!--Now port, port hard! More hands! He\ncannot put up the helm!\"\n\nThen out of the turmoil and confusion a great voice cried, \"A sail! A\nsail!\"\n\n\"Where?\"\n\n\"Fair by us.\"\n\n\"How stands she?\"\n\n\"To the north'ard.\"\n\nShe lay close hauled by the wind and as the Rose of Devon, scudding\nbefore the sea, bore down the wind and upon her, she hove out signs to\nspeak; but though Captain Candle passed under her lee as near as he\ndared venture and learned by lusty shouting that she was an English\nship from the East Indies, which begged the Rose of Devon for God's\nsake to spare them some provisions, since they were eighty persons on\nboard who were ready to perish for food and water, the seas ran so\nhigh that neither the one vessel nor the other dared hoist out a boat;\nand parting, the men of the Rose of Devon lost sight of her in the\ngathering dusk.\n\nStill more and more the storm increased. Darkness came, but there was\nno rest at sea that night.\n\nThanks to the storm, and the labour and anxiety it brought all hands,\nMartin, the latter part of that day, escaped the duties of ship's liar,\nand glad was he of the chance to slip unobserved about the deck with\nno reminder of his late humiliation. But by night he was blue with\nthe cold, and drenching wet and so hungry that he gnawed at a bit of\nbiscuit when he needed both hands to haul on a rope.\n\nFinding Phil Marsham at his shoulder and still resenting bitterly the\njest to which he had fallen victim, he shot at him an ill-tempered\nglance and in sullen silence turned his back.\n\n\"Belay!\"\n\nA line of struggling men tripped and stumbled as they secured the rope\nand went swaying and staggering across the deck when the ship rolled;\nfor the weight of her towering superstructure and her cannon would set\nher wallowing fearfully in the merest seaway. One caught up the rope's\nend in loose coils; another, having fallen, got clumsily on his feet\nand staunched his bleeding nose; the rest shivered as the icy wind\nstruck through their wet shirts.\n\nMartin again turned his back on the boatswain and hugged himself, but\nto little profit, although his fat arms covered a goodly area. Phil\nlaughed softly at Martin's show of spleen and was about to warm the\nman's temper further by a thrust well calculated to stir him to fury,\nwhen the ship rose with a queer lurch and descended into a veritable\ngulf.\n\nThey saw above them a sea looming like a black cloud. It mounted slowly\nup, hung over them, curled down a dark tongue of water and, before\nthe Rose of Devon had righted from her plunge into the trough, broke\nupon the ship and overwhelmed her. The waist was flooded from the head\nof the forecastle to the break of the poop. Water, licking across the\nquarter-deck, rose in a great wave that drenched the captain to his\nthighs and poured into the steerage room, momentarily blinding the men\nat the helm,--for in those old ships they stood with their faces on\na level with the quarter-deck,--and, following whipstaff and tiller,\nspilled into the main deck and hold.\n\nPhilip Marsham, as the water washed him off his feet, made shift to lay\nhands on the shrouds, and though he had no footing and was washed far\nout over the side, his grasp was strong and he held himself against the\nrush of water as the ship rose like a dog shaking its head and coming\nup through a wave. In very truth she seemed to shake her head and\nstruggle up to the black night above. But as Phil saved himself he saw\nMartin cowering by a gun and striving to reach the breeching; and as\nthe ship rose, the lad half felt, half saw, some great body washed past\nhim and over the side.\n\nThere was no one beside the gun: Martin was gone.\n\nThough a man were a knave and liar, Phil Marsham had no stomach to\nsee him drown thus; and though he held old Martin in contempt and\nbedevilled him night and day, yet he had a curious liking for the\nfellow. Overhead there hung from the maintop a loose rope. He faintly\nsaw it swinging against the leaden-black sky. By a nimble leap there\nwas a fair chance a man might reach it and if it did not part, an\nactive man might by a stroke of fortune regain the ship. All this Phil\nsaw in the falling of a single grain of sand, then the rope swung\nwithin reach of his hand and he seized it. Spared the hazard of\nleaping for it, he let go the shrouds and swung with all his strength\nout into the night.\n\nSwinging high over the sea he saw for an instant, while he was in\nmid-air, the Rose of Devon surging away from under him. The single\ngreat lanthorn was burning on her poop, and dim lights in forecastle\nand cabin showed that those parts of the ship, at least, had come up\nthrough the sea unflooded. He thought he saw a cloaked figure like a\nshadow on the quarter-deck. Then he slid down into darkness till the\nrope burned his hands, then he struck the water and went under, gasping\nat the shock, for the sea was as cold as a mountain stream. He caught\na last glimpse of the great ship, now looming high above him, then\nclutching fast the rope with one hand and wildly kicking out, he felt\nwith his knees what might be a man's body.\n\nWith his free hand he reached for the body. He snatched at an arm and\nmissed it, then felt hair brushing his fingers and tangled them in it\nand gripped it. He went down and down; then the drag of the water, for\nthe ship was scudding fast, raised him to the surface. The ship rolled\ntoward him and he again went under, overshadowed by the lofty poop\nwhich leaned out so far that notwithstanding the tumble home he thought\nthe poop would come down and crush him. The ship then rolled away from\nhim, and the rope brought up on his arm so hard that he feared the\nbones would pull from their sockets; but if he died in doing it he was\nbound he would hold the rope and keep his man.\n\nThe ship rolled till he bumped against her side and was lifted half out\nof water.\n\n\"Help!\" he cried. \"Help or we die!\"\n\nHe heard voices above and felt the rope move as if some one had seized\nit, then the looming bulk of the ship rolled back and drove him again\ndown into the sea.\n\nHe had no wind left for calling when he came up as once more the ship\nrolled, but the man he held had come to life and was clinging like a\nleech to the rope, which vastly lightened the strain, and some one\nabove was hauling on it. For a moment the two swung in air with the sea\nbeneath them, then the ship rolled farther and their weight rested on\nplanks, and hands from within the ship reached down and lifted them on\nboard.\n\nThe man--and it was indeed Martin--coughed like one who is deathly\nsick, as well he might be, and went rolling down the deck with a boy to\nhelp him. But Phil, having kept his head and having swallowed no great\nquantity of salt water, was able after breathing deeply a few times to\nstand alone beside Will Canty whose hands had drawn him to safety, and\nto perceive that waist, boat, capstan, windlass and sheet anchor were\nwashed away.\n\nHe then heard a pounding and shouting aft. \"What in the fiend's name\nhath befallen us?\" he demanded.\n\n\"'Tis even worse than doth appear,\" Will cried. \"The sea hath a free\npassage into the hold between the timber heads. They are pumping with\nboth pumps. The captain hath ordered the mizzenmast cut away, the\nbetter to keep us before the wind. Hear you not the sound of axes?\nAnd--\"\n\nOut of the darkness burst the mate. \"Come, my hearts! Below there! Cram\nblankets and hammocks into the leak, yea, the shirts from off your\nbacks! And then to the pumps to take your turn. And pray Almighty God\nto give us sight of another day.\"\n\nThere was running on the deck and shadows passed forward and aft.\n\nFrom the quarter-deck a clear voice, so sharp that it pierced the noise\nof the storm, was calling, \"Port the helm! Ease her, ease her! Now up!\nHard up! Ease her, ease her!\"\n\nAs the boatswain dropped through the hatch, he saw very dimly the\ncaptain crouching under the poop, his cloak drawn close about him.\n\nThere was wild confusion below, for as the ship rolled to starboard the\nsea burst in through the great gap along the timber heads and pushed\nthrough the gap and into the ship the blankets and rugs that were\nstuffed in place. Though the men leaped after them and came scrambling\nback to force them again into place between the timbers, and though\nthey tore down hammocks and jammed them in with the blankets to fill\nthe great opening, yet as the ship again rolled and the sea once more\ncame surging against the barrier, they again fled before it, and again\nthe sea cleared the gap and came flooding in upon the deck. It was a\nsight to fill a brave man with despair.\n\nThe more hands made faster work, and though the labour seemed spent in\nvain they stuffed the gap anew. But now when the ship again rolled to\nstarboard an old seaman raised his hand and roared, \"Every man to his\nplace and hold against the sea! Stay! Hold fast your ground!--Come,\nbullies, hold hard!--Good fellows! See, we have won!\"\n\nThey had perceived his meaning and braced themselves and with their\nhands they had held the stuffing in the gap until the pressure ceased,\nwhich was more of a feat than a man might think, since despite their\nevery effort the sea had found passage in great strong streams, yet\nthey held to the last; and when the ship rolled back, Boatswain Marsham\ncried out:--\n\n\"Now, Master Carpenter, quick! Bring great nails and hammer and a plank\nor two. Yare, yare!\"\n\n\"Yea, yea,\" the carpenter cried, and came running down the deck.\n\nThe men held the planking and the carpenter drove home the nails\nand thus they made the plank fast along the timbers behind the gap,\nwhere it would serve to brace the stuffing. Between the plank and the\nstuffing they forced a great mass of other wadding, and though the ship\nrolled ever so deeply the plank held against the sea. They left it so;\nbut all that night, which seemed as long as any night they had ever\nseen, no man slept in the Rose of Devon, for they still feared lest the\nsea should batter away the plank and work their undoing.\n\nAll night long they kept the pumps going and all night long they feared\ntheir labour would be lost. But at four in the morning one of the pumps\nsucked, which gave them vast comfort, and at daybreak they gave thanks\nto God, who had kept them safe until dawn.\n\nThe storm had passed and the sky was clear, and Phil and Martin met at\nsunrise.\n\n\"Since thou hast haled me out of the sea by the hair of my head,\" quoth\nMartin, after the manner of one who swallows a grievance he can ill\nstomach, \"I must e'en give thee good morrow.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nTHE MASTER'S GUEST\n\n\n\"A sail! A sail!\"\n\nThe seas had somewhat abated and the Rose of Devon was standing on her\ncourse under reefed mainsail when the cry sounded.\n\nThe vessel they sighted lay low in the water; and since she had one\ntall mast forward and what appeared to be a lesser mast aft they\nthought her a ketch. But while they debated the matter the faint sound\nof guns fired in distress came over the sea; and loosing the reef of\ntheir mainsail and standing directly toward the stranger, the men in\nthe Rose of Devon soon made her out to be, instead, a ship which had\nlost her mainmast and mizzenmast and was wallowing like a log. While\nthe Rose of Devon was still far off, her men saw that some of the\nstrange crew were aloft in the rigging and that others were huddled on\nthe quarter-deck; and when, in the late afternoon, she came up under\nthe stranger's stern, the unknown master and his men got down on their\nknees on the deck and stretched their arms above their bare heads.\n\n\"Save us,\" they cried in a doleful voice, \"for the Lord Jesus' sake!\nFor our ship hath six-foot water in the hold and we can no longer keep\nher afloat.\"\n\nIn all the Rose of Devon there was not a heart but relented at their\nlamentable cry, not a man but would do his utmost to lend them aid.\n\n\"Hoist out thy boat and we will stand by to succour thee,\" Captain\nCandle called. \"We can do no more, for we ha' lost our own boat in the\nstorm.\"\n\nIt appeared they had but one boat, which was small, so they must needs\ndivide the crew to leave their vessel, part at one time and part at\nanother; and the seas still ran so high, though wind and wave had\nmoderated, that it seemed impossible they could make the passage. With\nmen at both her pumps the Rose of Devon lay by the wind, wallowing and\nplunging, and her own plight seemed a hard one. But the poor stranger,\nthough ever and again she rose on the seas so that the water drained\nfrom her scupper-holes, lay for the most part with her waist a-wash\nand a greater sea than its fellows would rise high on the stumps of\nmainmast and mizzenmast. Her ropes dragged over the side and her\nsails were a snarl of canvas torn to shreds, and a very sad sight she\npresented.\n\nThree times they tried to hoist out their boat and failed; but the\nfourth time they got clear, and with four men rowing and one steering\nand seven with hats and caps heaving out the water, they came in the\ntwilight slowly down the wind past the Rose of Devon and up into her\nlee.\n\nThe men at the waist of the ship saw more clearly, now, the features\nof those in the boat, and the one in the stern who handled the great\nsteering oar had in the eyes of Philip Marsham an oddly familiar look.\nPhil gazed at the man, then he turned to Martin and knew he was not\nmistaken, for Martin's mouth was agape and he was on the very point of\ncrying out.\n\n\"Holla!\" Martin yelled.\n\nThe man in the stern of the boat looked up and let his eyes range\nalong the waist of the ship. Not one of all those in sight on board\nthe Rose of Devon escaped his scrutiny, which was quick and sure;\nbut he looked Martin coldly in the face without so much as a nod of\nrecognition; and though his brief glance met Phil's gaze squarely and\nseemed for the moment to linger and search the lad's thoughts, it then\npassed to the one at Phil's side.\n\nIt was the thin man who had been Martin's companion on the road--it was\nTom Jordan--it was the Old One.\n\nMartin's face flamed, but he held his tongue.\n\nA line thrown to the boat went out through the air in coils that\nstraightened and sagged down between the foremost thwarts. A sailor\nin the boat, seizing the line, hauled upon it with might and main.\nThe Old One hotly cursed him, and bellowed, \"Fend off, fend off, thou\nslubbering clown! Thy greed to get into the ship will be the means of\ndrowning us all.\"\n\nSome thrust out oars to fend away from the side of the ship and some\nheld back; but two or three, hungering for safety, gave him no heed and\nhauled on the rope and struggled to escape out of their little boat,\nwhich was already half full of water. The Old One then rose with a look\nof the Fiend in his eyes and casting the steering oar at the foremost\nof them, knocked the man over into the sea, where he sank, leaving a\nblotch of red on the surface, which was a terrible sight and brought\nthe others to observe the Old One's commands.\n\nSome cried \"Save him!\" but the Old One roared, \"Let the mutinous dog\ngo!\"\n\nPerhaps he was right, for there are times when it takes death to\nmaintain the discipline that will save many lives. At all events it\nwas then too late to save either the man or the boat, for although they\nstrove thereafter to do as the Old One bade them, the boat had already\nthumped against the side of the ship and it was each man for himself\nand the Devil take the last. The men above threw other ropes and bent\nover to give a hand to the poor fellows below, and all but the man who\nhad sunk came scrambling safe on board.\n\nThe Old One leaned out and looked down at the boat, which lay full of\nwater, with a great hole in her side.\n\n\"I would have given my life sooner than let this happen,\" he said.\n\"There are seven men left on board our ship, who trusted me to save\nthem. Indeed, I had not come away but these feared lest without the\nmaster you should refuse to take them. What say ye, my baw-cocks, shall\nwe venture back for our shipmates?\"\n\nLooking down at the boat and at the gaping holes the sea had stove by\nthrowing her against the Rose of Devon, the men made no reply.\n\n\"Not one will venture back? Is there no one of ye?\"\n\n\"'Twere madness,\" one began. \"We should--\"\n\n\"See! She hath gone adrift!\"\n\nAnd in truth, her gunwales under water, the boat was already drifting\nastern. At the end of the painter, which a Rose of Devon's man still\nheld, there dangled a piece of broken board.\n\n\"Let us bring thy ship nigh under the lee of mine,\" the Old One cried\nto Captain Candle. \"It may be that by passing a line we can yet save\nthem.\"\n\n\"It grieves me sorely to refuse them aid, but to approach nearer, with\nthe darkness now drawing upon us, were an act of folly that might well\ncost the lives of us all. Mine own ship is leaking perilously and in\nthis sea, were the two to meet, both would most certainly go down.\"\n\nThe Old One looked about and nodded. \"True,\" said he. \"There is no\nrecovering the boat and darkness is upon us. Let us go as near to\nthe ship as we may and bid them have courage till morning, when, God\nwilling, we shall try to get aboard and save them.\"\n\n\"That we will. And I myself will con the ship.\"\n\nLeaning over the rail, Tom Jordan, the Old One, called out, \"Holla, my\nhearts! The boat hath gone adrift with her sides stove; but do you make\na raft and keep abroad a light until morning, when God helping us, we\nwill endeavor to get you aboard.\"\n\nPerceiving for the first time that the boat was gone and there was\nno recovering her, those left on board the wreck gave a cry so sad\nthat it pierced the hearts of all in the Rose of Devon, whose men saw\nthem through the dusk doing what they could to save themselves; and\npresently their light appeared.\n\nWorking the Rose of Devon to windward of the wreck, Captain Candle lay\nby, but all his endeavours could not avail to help them, for about ten\no'clock at night, three hours after the Old One and his ten men had got\non board the Rose of Devon, their ship sank and their light went out\nand seven men lost their lives.\n\nThe Old One, standing beside Captain Candle, had watched the light to\nthe last. \"It is a bitter grief to bear,\" he said, \"for they were seven\nbrave men. A master could desire no better mariners. 'Tis the end of\nthe Blue Friggat from Virginia, bound for Portsmouth, wanting seven\nweeks.\"\n\n\"A man can go many years to sea without meeting such a storm.\"\n\n\"Yea! Three days ago when the wind was increasing all night we kept\nonly our two courses abroad. At daybreak we handed our main course,\nbut before we had secured it the storm burst upon us so violently that\nI ordered the foreyard lowered away; but not with all their strength\ncould the men get it down, and of them all not one had a knife to cut\naway the sail, for they wore only their drawers without pockets; so the\ngale drove us head into the sea and stopped our way and a mighty sea\npooped us and filled us and we lay with only our masts and forecastle\nout of the water. I myself, being fastened to the mizzenmast with a\nrope, had only my head out of water. Yea, we expected to go straight\ndown to the bottom, but God of his infinite goodness was pleased to\ndraw us from the deep and another sea lifted up our ship. We got down\nour foresail and stowed it and bored holes between the decks to let\nthe water into the hold and by dint of much pumping we kept her afloat\nuntil now. In all we have lost eight lives this day and a sad day it\nis.\"\n\n\"From Virginia, wanting seven weeks,\" Captain Candle mused.\n\nCaptain Jordan stole a swift glance at him but saw no suspicion in his\nface.\n\n\"Yea, from Virginia.\"\n\n\"You shall share mine own cabin but I fear you have come only from one\nwreck to another.\"\n\nThe two captains sat late that night at the table in the great cabin,\none on each side, and ate and drank. There was fine linen on the table,\nand bread of wheat flour with butter less than two weeks from the\ndairy, and a fine old cheese, and a mutton stew, and canary and sack\nand aqua vit\u00c3\u00a6. At midnight they were still lingering over the suckets\nand almonds and comfits that the boy had set before them; and the boy,\nnodding in uncontrollable drowsiness as he stood behind his master's\nchair, strove to keep awake.\n\nThe murmuring voices of the men at the helm came faintly through the\nbulkhead, and up from below the deck came the creak of whipstaff and\ntiller. The moon, shining through the cabin window, added its wan light\nto the yellow radiance from the swinging lanthorns, and stars were to\nbe seen. So completely had wind and weather changed in a night and a\nday that, save for the long rolling swell, the great gap where waist\nand boat and capstan had gone, the hole stuffed with blankets and\nrugs and hammocks, the stump of a mizzenmast, and the rescued men on\nboard--save for these, a man might have forgotten storms and wrecks.\n\n\"You are well found,\" said Captain Thomas Jordan, tilting his glass\nand watching the wine roll toward the brim; \"yea, and we are in good\nfortune.\" His thin face, as he lifted his brows and slightly smiled at\nhis host, settled into the furrowed wrinkles that had won him the name\nof the Old One.\n\n\"We can give such entertainment as is set before you,\" his host drily\nreplied. Francis Candle was too shrewd a man to miss his guest's\nsearching appraisal of the cabin and its furnishings. In his heart he\nalready distrusted the fellow.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nBETWEEN MIDNIGHT AND MORNING\n\n\nThrough the main deck to the gun-room and up into the forecastle there\ndrifted smoke from the cookroom in the hold, which was the way of those\nold ships. At times it set choking the men at the pumps; it eddied\nabout the water cask before the mainmast and about the riding butts by\nthe heel of the bowsprit, and went curling out of the hawse pipes. It\ncrept insidiously into the forecastle, and the men cursed fluently when\ntheir eyes began to smart and their noses to sting.\n\nThere were seven men in the forecastle and Martin Barwick was one of\nthe seven, although his watch was on deck and he had no right to be\nthere. Philip Marsham, whose watch was below, had stayed because he\nsuspected there was some strange thing in the wind and was determined\nto learn if possible what it was. Two of the others were younkers of\nthe Rose of Devon, who suspected nothing, and the remaining three were\nof the rescued men.\n\nThere was a step above and a round head appeared in the hatch. The dim\nsmoky light gave a strange appearance to the familiar features.\n\n\"Ho, cook!\" Martin cried, and thumped on the table. \"Come thou down\nand bring us what tidings the boy hath brought thee in the cookroom.\nYea, though the cook labour in the very bowels of the ship, is it not a\nproverb that he alone knows all that goes on?\"\n\nSlipping through the hatch, the cook drew a great breath and sat him\ndown by the table. \"She was the Blue Friggat, I hear, and seven weeks\nfrom Virginia--God rest the souls of them who went down in her!\"\n\n\"From Virginia!\" quoth Martin. \"Either th' art gulled, in truth, or th'\nart the very prince of liars. From Virginia! Ho ho!\" And Martin laughed\nloud and long.\n\nNow it was for such a moment that Philip Marsham was waiting, nor had\nhe doubted the moment would come. For although Martin had gone apart\nwith the men who had come from the foundered ship, the fellow's head,\nwhich was larger than most heads, could never keep three ideas in\nflourish at the same time. To learn what game was in the wind there was\nneed only to keep close at Martin's heels until his blunders should\ndisclose his secrets.\n\n\"The Devil take thee, thou alehouse dog!\" the cook cried in a thick,\nwheezy voice. \"Did not the boy bring me word straight when he came down\nfor a can of boiling water with which this Captain Jordan would prepare\na wondrous drink for Captain Candle?\"\n\n\"And did not I part with this Captain Jordan not--Wow-ouch!\" With a\nyell Martin tipped back in his chair and went over. Crawling on his\nfeet, he put on a long face and rubbed his head and hurled a flood of\noaths at the sailor beside him, a small man and round like an apple,\nwho went among his fellows--for he was one of those the Rose of Devon\nhad rescued--by the name of Harry Malcolm.\n\n\"Nay,\" the little round man very quietly replied, \"I fear you not, for\nall your bluster. Put your hand on your tongue, fellow, and see if\nyou cannot hold it. I had not intended to tip you over. It was done\ncasually.\"\n\n\"And why, perdy, did'st thou jam thy foot on mine till the bones\ncrunched? I'll have thy heart's blood.\"\n\n\"Nay,\" the man replied, so quietly, so calmly that he might have been\na clerk sitting on his stool, \"you have a way of talking overmuch,\nfellow, and I have a misliking of speech that babbles like a brook. It\ncan make trouble.\"\n\nMartin stopped as if he had lost his voice, but continued to glare at\nthe stranger, who still regarded him with no concern.\n\n\"It is thy weakness, fellow,\" he said, \"and--\" he looked very hard at\nMartin--\"it may yet be the occasion of thine untimely end.\"\n\nFor a moment Martin stood still, then, swallowing once or twice, he\nwent out of the dimly lighted forecastle into the darkness of the deck.\n\n\"He appears,\" the little man said, addressing the others, \"to be an\nexcitable fellow. Alas, what trouble a brisk tongue can bring upon a\nman!\"\n\nThe little man, Harry Malcolm, looked from one to another and longest\nat Phil.\n\nNow Phil could not say there had been a hidden meaning in the hard look\nthe little man had given Martin or in the long look the little man had\ngiven Phil himself. But he knew that whether this was so or not, there\nwas no more to be got that night from Martin, and he in turn, further\nbepuzzled by the little man's words and after all not much enlightened\nby Martin's blunder, left the forecastle to seek the main deck.\n\nPassing the great cannon lashed in their places, and leaving behind him\nthe high forecastle, he came into the shadow of the towering poop on\nwhich the lantern glowed yellow in the blue moonlight, and continued\naft to the hatch ladder. Already it was long past midnight.\n\nHe imagined he heard voices in the great cabin, and although he well\nenough knew that it was probably only imagination,--for the cabin door\nwas closed fast,--the presence of the Old One on board the Rose of\nDevon was enough to make a man imagine things, who had sat in Mother\nTaylor's cottage and listened to talk of the gentlemen who sailed from\nBideford. He paused at the head of the ladder and listened, but heard\nnothing more.\n\nAn hour passed. There were fewer sounds to break the silence. There is\nno time like the very early morning for subtle and mysterious deeds.\n\nBoatswain Marsham was asleep below and Captain Candle was asleep aft,\nwhen Captain Jordan arose and stretched himself, and in a voice that\nwould have been audible to Captain Candle if he had been awake but that\nwas so low it did not disturb his sleep, vowed he must breathe fresh\nair ere he could bury his head in a blanket for the night.\n\nEmerging from the great cabin, Captain Jordan climbed first to the\npoop, whence he looked down on the brave old ship and the wide space of\nsky and darkly heaving sea within the circle of the horizon. To look\nthus at the sea is enough to make a philosopher of a thinking man, and\nthis Captain Thomas Jordan was by no means devoid of thought.\n\nBut whereas many a one who stands under the bright stars in the small\nmorning hours feels himself a brother with the most trifling creatures\nthat live and is filled with humility to consider in relation to the\nimmeasurable powers of the universe his weakness during even his brief\nspace of life--whereas such a one perceives himself to be, like the\nprophets of ancient times, in a Divine Presence, the Old One, his\nface strangely youthful in its repose, threw back his head and softly\nlaughed, as if there high on the poop he were a god of the heathen, who\ncould blot out with his thumb the ship and all the souls that sailed\nin her. His face had again a haunting likeness to the devils in the\nold wood-cuts; and indeed there is something of the devil in the very\negotism of a man who can thus assert his vain notions at such an hour.\n\nPresently descending from the poop and with a nod passing on the\nquarter-deck the officer of the watch, he paced for a time the\nmaintop-deck. He pretended to absorb himself in the sea and the damage\nthe storm had done to the waist; but he missed nothing that happened\nand he observed the whereabouts of every man in the watch.\n\nEdging slowly forward, he stood at last beside a big man who was\nleaning in the shadow of the forecastle.\n\n\"We meet sooner than you thought,\" he said in a low voice.\n\n\"Yea, for we were long on the road and entangled ourselves wonderfully\namong those byways and high-ways which cross the country in a manner\nperplexing beyond belief.\"\n\n\"Saw you your brother?\"\n\n\"In all truth I saw him--and the Devil take him!\"\n\nThe Old One laughed softly.\n\n\"It is plain thy brother hath little love for a shipwrecked mariner,\"\nquoth he, \"yet there is a most memorable antiquity about the use of\nships, and even greater gluttons than thy brother have supped light\nthat worthy seamen might not go hungry to bed. We will speak of him\nanother time. What think you of this pretty pup we have met by the\nway?--Ah, thine eye darkens! Methinks thou hast more than once felt the\nrough side of his tongue.\"\n\n\"He bears himself somewhat struttingly--\" Martin hesitated, but added\nperforce, since he had received a friendly turn he could not soon\nforget, \"yet he hath his good points.\"\n\n\"He was one too many for thee! Nay, confess it!\"\n\n\"Th' art a filthy rascal!\" Martin's face burned with anger.\n\n\"I knew he would be too cunning for thy wool-gathering wits. Truly I\nbelieve he is a lad after my own heart. I have marked him well.\"\n\n\"But hast thou plumbed his inclination with thy sounding lead?\"\n\n\"Why, no. At worst, he can disappear. It has happened to taller men\nthan he, and in a land where there are men at arms to come asking\nquestions.\"\n\n\"Hgh!\"\n\n\"This for thy whining, though: we shall play upon him lightly. Some are\nnot worth troubling over, but this lad is a cunning rogue and hath book\nlearning.\"\n\n\"Came you in search of this ship?\"\n\n\"It was chance alone that brought us across her course. Chance alone,\nMartin, that brought your old captain back to you.\"\n\nWatching Martin, as he spoke, the Old One again laughed softly.\n\n\"Yea, Martin, it touches the heart of your old captain to see with what\npleasure you receive him.\"\n\n\"Th' art a cunning devil,\" Martin muttered, and babbled oaths and\ncurses.\n\n\"We must sleep, Martin--sleep and eat, for we are spent with much\nlabour and many hardships, and it is well for them to sail our ship for\nus a while longer. But the hour will come, and do you then stand by.\"\n\nThe Old One went aft. The ship rolled drowsily and the watch nodded.\nSurveying her aloft and alow, as a man does who is used to command, and\nnot as a guest on board might do, the Old One left the deck.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nHEAD WINDS AND A ROUGH SEA\n\n\n\"Lacking the mizzen she labours by the wind, which hath veered sadly\nduring the night,\" quoth Captain Jordan in a sleepy voice, as with his\nhost he came upon deck betimes.\n\n\"I like it little,\" the master replied.\n\n\"It would be well to lay a new course and sail on a new voyage. There\nis small gain to be got from these fisheries. A southern voyage, now,\npromises returns worth the labour.\"\n\nTo this Captain Candle made no reply. He studied the sore damage done\nto the ship, upon which already the carpenter was at work.\n\n\"With a breadth of canvas and hoops to batten the edges fast, and\nover all a coating of tar, a man might make her as tight and dry as\nyou please,\" said the Old One. He smiled when he spoke and his manner\ngalled his host.\n\n\"It was in my own mind,\" Captain Candle replied, with an angry lift\nof his head. There are few things more grievously harassing than the\nimportunity and easy assurance of a guest of whom there is no riddance.\nIt puts a man where he is peculiarly helpless to defend himself, and\nalready Captain Candle's patience had ebbed far. \"Bid the boatswain\noverhaul his canvas, mate, and the carpenter prepare such material as\nbe needful. Aye, and bid the 'liar' stand ready to go over the side.\n'Twill cool his hot pride, of which it seems he hath full measure.\"\n\n\"Yea, yea!\"\n\nAs the master paced the deck, back and forth and back and forth,\nthe Old One walked at his side--for he was a shrewd schemer and had\ncalculated his part well--until the master's gorge rose. \"I must return\nto the cabin,\" he said at last, \"and overhaul my journal.\"\n\n\"I will bear you company.\"\n\n\"No, no!\"\n\nThe Old One smiled as if in deprecation; but as the master turned away,\nthe smile broadened to a grin.\n\nBoatswain Marsham and the one-eyed carpenter who wore a beard like\na goat's were on their way to the forehold. The cook and his mate\nwere far down in the cookroom. Ten men in the watch below were sound\nasleep--but Martin Barwick, the eleventh man in the watch, was on deck,\n_and of the eleven rescued men not one was below_. With Captain Candle\nsafe in his cabin and busied over his journal, there were left from the\ncompany of the Rose of Devon eight men and the mate, and one man of the\neight was at the helm. These the Old One counted as he took a turn on\nthe quarter-deck.\n\nThe Old One and his men were refreshed by a night of sleep and restored\nby good food. To all appearances, without care or thought to trouble\nthem, they ruffled about the deck. One was standing just behind the\nmate; two were straying toward the steerage.\n\n\"Thy boatswain is a brave lad,\" the Old One said to the mate, and\nstepping in front of him, he spread his legs and folded his arms.\n\nThe mate nodded. He had less liking for their guest, if it were\npossible, than the captain.\n\n\"A brave lad,\" the Old One repeated. \"I can use him.\"\n\n\"You?\"\n\n\"Yea, I.\"\n\nThe mate drew back a step, as a man does when another puts his face too\nnear. He was on the point of speaking; but before his lips had phrased\na word the Old One raised his hand and the man behind the mate drove\nsix inches of blue steel into the mate's back, between his ribs and\nthrough his heart.\n\nHe died in the Old One's arms, for the Old One caught him before he\nfell, and held him thus.\n\n\"Well done,\" the Old One said to his man.\n\n\"Not so well as one could wish,\" the man replied, wiping his knife on\nthe mate's coat. \"He perished quietly enough, but the knife bit into a\nrib and the feeling of a sharp knife dragging upon bone sets my teeth\non edge.\"\n\nThe Old One laughed. \"Thy stomach is exceeding queasy,\" he said. \"Come,\nlet us heave him over the side.\"\n\nAll this, remember, had happened quickly and very quietly. There were\nthe three men standing by the quarter-deck ladder--the Old One and his\nman and the mate--and by all appearances the Old One merely put out\nhis hands in a friendly manner to the other, for the knife thrust was\nhidden by a cloak. But now the mate's head fell forward in a queer,\nlackadaisical way and four of the Old One's men, perceiving what they\nlooked for, slipped past him through the door to the steerage room,\nwhere they clapped down the hatch to the main deck. One stood on the\nhatch; two stood by the door of the great cabin; and the fourth,\nstepping up to the man at the helm, flashed a knife from his sleeve\nand cut the fellow down.\n\nIt was a deft blow, but not so sure as the thrust that had killed the\nmate. The helmsman dropped the whipstaff and, falling, gave forth a\nyell and struck at his assailant, who again let drive at him with the\nknife and finished the work, so that the fellow lay with bloody froth\nat his lips and with fingers that twitched a little and then were still.\n\nThe man who had killed him took the whipstaff and called softly,\n\"Holla, master! We hold the helm!\" then from his place he heard a\nsailor cry out, \"The mate is falling! Lend him aid!\"\n\nThen the Old One's voice, rising to a yell, called, \"Stand back! Stand\noff! Now, my hearts!\"\n\nThere came a quick tempest of voices, a shrill cry, the pounding of\nmany feet, then a splash, then a cry wilder and more shrill than any\nbefore, \"Nay, I yield--quarter! Quarter, I say! Mercy! God's mercy, I\nbeg of you! Help--O God!\"\n\nThere was at the same time a rumble of hoarse voices and a sound of\ngreat struggling, then a shriek and a second splash.\n\nThe man at the helm kicked the dead helmsman to one side and listened.\nIn the great cabin, behind the bulkhead at his back, he heard a sudden\nstir. As between the mainmast and the forecastle the yells rose louder,\nthe great cabin door burst open and out rushed Captain Francis Candle\nin a rich waist with broad cuffs at his wrists, his hair new oiled\nwith jessamine butter, and gallant bows at his knees, for he was a\nfine gentleman who had first gone to sea as a lieutenant in the King's\nservice. As he rushed out the door the man lying in wait on the left\nstruck a fierce blow to stab him, but the knife point broke on a steel\nplate which it seemed Captain Candle wore concealed to foil just such\ndastardly work.\n\nThereupon, turning like a flash, Captain Candle spitted the scoundrel\nwith his sword. But the man lying in wait on the right of the door saw\nhis fellow's blow fail and perceived the reason, and leaping on the\ncaptain from behind, he seized his oiled hair with one hand and hauled\nback his head, and reaching forward with the other hand, drove a knife\ninto the captain's bare throat.\n\nDark blood from a severed vein streamed out over Captain Candle's\ncollar and his gay waist. He coughed and his eyes grew dull. He let go\nhis sword, which remained stuck through the body of the man who had\nfirst struck at him, clapped his hand to his neck, and went down in a\nheap.\n\nThe yells on deck had ceased and the man who had killed Francis Candle,\nafter glancing into the great cabin where the captain's cloak lay\nspread over the chair from which he rose to step out of his door and\ndie,--where the captain's pen lay across the pages of the open journal\nand a bottle of the captain's wine, which he had that morning shared\nwith his guest, Captain Thomas Jordan, stood beside the unstoppered\nbottle of ink,--walked forth upon the deck and nodded to the Old One,\nwho stood with his hand on the after swivel gun.\n\nThere were a few splotches of blood on the deck and three men of the\nRose of Devon's crew lay huddled in a heap; there were left standing\nthree other men of the Rose of Devon, and sick enough they looked;\nMartin Barwick was stationed by the ladder to the forecastle, where\nhe stood like a pigeon cock with his head haughtily in the air and his\nchest thrust out; and the little round apple of a man, Harry Malcolm,\nwho had broken in upon Martin the night before, bearing now a new\nand bloody gash across his forehead, was prowling among the guns and\ntapping the breech rings with a knowing air.\n\nThe Old One from the quarter-deck looked down at the new comer.\n\n\"Rab took the steel,\" the fellow said.\n\n\"Rab!\" the Old One cried. \"Not Rab, you say?\"\n\n\"Yea, he struck first but the master wore an iron shirt which turned\nthe point and he was then at him with his sword.\"\n\n\"We have lost nine good men by this devil-begotten storm, but of them\nall Rab is the one I am most loath to see go to the sharks.\" The Old\nOne paced the deck a while and the others talked in undertones. \"Yea,\nMartin,\" he called at last, \"nine good men. But we have got us a ship\nand I have great hopes of our boatswain, who may yet make us two of\nRab. At all events, my bullies, we must lay us a new course, for I have\nno liking of these northern fisheries. Hark! They are pounding on the\nhatch.\"\n\nThe sound of knocking and a muffled calling came from the main hatch,\nwhereat the men on deck looked at one another and some of them smiled.\n\n\"It were well--\" the little round man began. He glanced at the huddled\nbodies and shrugged.\n\n\"True, true!\" the Old One replied, for he needed no words to complete\nthe meaning. \"You men of the Rose of Devon, heave them into the sea.\"\n\nThe three looked at one another and hesitated, and the youngest of the\nthree turned away his face and put his hand on his belly, and sick\nenough he looked, at which a great laugh went up.\n\n\"Go, Harry,\" the Old One cried to the little round man, \"and tell them\nat the hatch to be still, for that we shall presently have them on\ndeck. We must learn our brave recruits a lesson.\"\n\nAgain a roar of laughter rose, and as the little man went in to\nthe hatch, the others drew about the three who cowered against the\nforecastle ladder, as well they might.\n\n\"Come, silly dogs,\" said the Old One, \"in faith, you must earn your\nfoolish lives. Lay hands on those carcasses and heave them to the\nfishes.\"\n\nThey looked into the faces of the men about them, but got small comfort\nas they edged toward their unwelcome task.\n\n\"It is hard to use thus a shipmate of three voyages,\" the oldest of\nthem muttered.\n\n\"True,\" replied the Old One, \"but so shall you buy your way into a\ngoodlier company of shipmates, who traffic in richer cargoes than\npickled codfish and New England herrings.\"\n\nThe three picked up the bodies, one at a time, each with its arms and\nlegs dragging, and carried them to the waist and pushed them over. But\nthe youngest of the three was trembling like a dead weed in November\nwhen they had finished, and the Old One chuckled to see the fellow's\nwhite face.\n\n\"Have courage, bawcock,\" the Old One cried; \"there shall soon be\na round of aqua vit\u00c3\u00a6 to warm thy shaking limbs and send the blood\ncoursing through thy veins. Now, Mate Harry, lift off the hatch and\nsummon our good boatswain and carpenter.\"\n\n\"As you please, as you please,\" came the quick, gentle voice of the\nlittle round man. \"But there are two of 'em left still--Rab and the\ncaptain--and there's a deal of blood hereabouts.\"\n\nThey heard the hatch creak as the little man pried it off. They heard\nhis quick sentences pattering out one after another: \"Hasten out on\ndeck--nay, linger not. The master would have speech of thee. Nay,\nlinger not. Ask me no questions! There's no time for lingering.\"\n\nThen out burst Phil Marsham with the older carpenter puffing at his\nheels.\n\n\"What's afoot?\" cried Phil. \"Where's the master?--what--where--\"\n\nSo speedily had they hurried from the hatch (and so cleverly had the\nlittle round man interposed himself between the hatch and the two\nbodies at the cabin door) that in the dim light of the steerage room\nthe two had perceived nothing amiss. But now, looking about for the\nsource of the fierce cries and yells they had heard, they saw red\nstains on the deck, and men with scared white faces.\n\nAll looked toward the Old One as if awaiting his reply; and when\nPhil Marsham, too, looked toward him, he met such another quizzing,\nsearching, understanding gaze as he had long ago met when he had taken\nthe words from Martin's lips on the little hill beside the road.\n\n\"Why, I am master now, good boatswain.\"\n\n\"But Captain Candle--\"\n\n\"His flame is out.\"\n\nThe lad glanced about him at the circle of hard old sea dogs--for they\nwere all of them that, were their years few or many--and drew away till\nhe stood with the waist at his back. Laying hands on his dirk, he said\nin a voice that slightly trembled, \"And now?\"\n\n\"Why,\" quoth the Old One, \"you have sat in Mother Taylor's kitchen and\nheard talk of the gentlemen. You know too many secrets. Unless you are\none of us--\" He finished with a shrug.\n\n\"You ask me, then, to join you?\"\n\n\"Yea.\"\n\n\"I refuse.\" He looked the Old One in the eye.\n\n\"Why, then,\" said the Old One, \"you are the greater fool.\"\n\nThe circle drew closer.\n\n\"What then?\"\n\n\"'Tis but another candle to be snuffed.\"\n\nWith hand on dirk and with back against the waist, the boatswain looked\none and another and then another in the eye. \"Why, then,\" said he, \"I\nmust even join you, as you say. But I call upon you all to witness I am\na forced man.\" And he looked longest and hardest at the three men from\nthe old crew of the Rose of Devon.\n\nThe Old One looked back at the lad and there was, for the first time,\ndoubt in his glance. He stood for a while pondering in silence all that\nhad taken place and studying the face of his boatswain; but his liking\nof the lad's spirit outweighed his doubts, for such bold independence,\nwhether in friend or foe, was the one sure key to Tom Jordan's heart.\n\"So be it,\" he said at last. \"But remember, my fine young fellow, that\nmany a cockerel hath got his neck wrung by crowing out of season.\" He\nturned to the carpenter. \"And what say you? We can use a man of your\ncraft.\"\n\n\"I am thy man!\" the fellow cried. The stains on the deck had made him\nsurpassingly eager, and his one eye winked and his beard wagged, so\neager was he to declare his allegiance.\n\n\"Well said!\" the Old One responded. \"And now, Master Harry, have them\nup from below--the sleepers, and the cook and his mate, and all! We\nhave taken a fine ship--a fine ship she will be, at all events, once\nour good carpenter has done his work--and well found. We needs must\nsign a crew to sail and fight her.\"\n\nThey heard the little round man calling down the hatch and at a great\ndistance in the ship they heard the voices of men grumbling at being\nsummoned out of sleep. But the grumbling was stilled when one by one\nthe men came out on deck; and of them all, not a man refused to cast\nhis lot with the Old One and the rest. The mere sight of a little blood\nand of the hard faces that greeted them was enough for most. And two or\nthree, of whom Will Canty was one, must fain perceive how futile would\nbe present resistance. Indeed, in the years since the old Queen had\ndied, and the navy had gone to the dogs, and merchantmen had come to\nsail from the Downs knowing they were likely enough to meet a squadron\nof galleys lying in wait fifty leagues off the Lizard, many a sailor\nhad taken his fling at buccaneering; and those that had not, had heard\nsuch great tales of galleons laden with treasures of the Indies and\nwith beautiful dames of Spain that their palates were whetted for a\ntaste of the life.\n\nThe cook smiled broadly and clapped the boy on the back and cried out\nthat as a little lad he had sailed with John Jennings what time John\nJennings's wench had turned his luck, and that having begun life in\nsuch brave company, he would gladly end it in a proper voyage if it\nwas written that his time was near. They all laughed to see the boy\nturn white and tremble, and they huzzaed the cook for his gallant\nwords. But Will Canty met Phil's eyes and there passed between them a\nlook that made the Old One frown, for he was a man who saw everything.\n\nThe Rose of Devon, although close-hauled by the wind, rolled heavily,\nwhich was the way of those old tall ships; but the adverse winds and\nhigh seas she had encountered were of fancy as well as of fact. The sun\nwas shining brightly and sky and sea were a clear blue; but despite\nsun and sky and sea no weatherwise man could have believed the dark\ndays of the Rose of Devon were at an end. Like so many iron bars the\nshadows of the ropes fell blue on the sails, and the red blotches on\nthe deck matched the dull red paint of the stanchions and the waist.\nThe carpenter, who had come up with his plane in his hand, fingered the\nsteel blade. The boy turned his back on the bloody deck and looked away\nat the sea, for he was a little fellow and not hardened by experience\nof the world.\n\n\"Come, my hearts,\" cried the Old One, and gaily enough he spoke.\n\"We are banded together for the good of all. There is no company of\nmerchants to profit by our labour and our blood. God hath placed in\nour keeping this brave ship, which will be staunch and sea-worthy\nwhen our carpenter hath done his work. Harry Malcolm is our mate\nand master gunner as of old, and Phil Marsham shall continue as our\nboatswain--nay, grumble not! He came with Martin Barwick and he hath\nsat in Mother Taylor's kitchen, where may we all sit soon and raise our\ncans and drink thanks for a rich voyage. There is work to be done, for\nall must be made clean and tight--yea, and Rab is to be buried.\"\n\nThe little round man was still wandering from gun to gun and smiling\nbecause the guns pleased him. They were demiculverins of brass, bored\nfor a twelve-pound ball and fit to fight the King's battles; but alas!\nthey had shown themselves powerless against a foe from within the ship.\nAnd as the Rose of Devon rolled along in the bright sun, alone in a\nblue sea, the body of Francis Candle lay forgotten in the steerage\nroom.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nTHE PORCUPINE KETCH\n\n\nLooking down from the quarter-deck the Old One spied the cook, who had\ncome up to warm his bald head and fat face in the sun and to clear the\nsmoke from his nostrils. \"Ho, cook,\" quoth he, \"I have a task for thee.\nBreak out from the cabin stores rice and currants and cinnamon and the\nfinest of thy wheaten flour. Seek you also a few races of green ginger.\nIt may chance there is even a little marchpane, for this man Candle had\na gentle palate. Spare not your old cheese, and if you unearth a cask\nof fine wine fail not to tell of it. In a word, draw forth an abundance\nof the best and make us such a feast as a man may remember in his old\nage.\"\n\nThe cook smiled and rubbed his round paunch (yet cringed a little), for\nhe was of a mind, being never slow in such matters, to filch from the\ncabin table whatever he might desire and his heart warmed to hear the\ngood victuals named. \"Yea, master,\" he cried, \"for thee and for Mate\nMalcolm?\"\n\n\"Nay, thou parsimonious dog! Think you that such are the manners of\ngentlemen mariners? Times have changed. Though I be master, there is no\nsalt at my board. One man is as good as another and any man may rub his\nshoulder with mine.\"\n\nThe Old One's own men chuckled at the cook's blank face and the boy\nshivered when he thought that he must wait on them all, of whom one was\nas likely as another to fetch him a blow on the head. But the cook\nwent down below and they heard him bawling to his mate to come and help\nbreak out the cabin stores, and word went through the ship of what\nwas afoot. And though Will Canty and the boatswain, meeting, glanced\ndubiously each at the other, as did others of the Rose of Devon's old\ncompany,--for matters are in a sad way in a ship when the master feasts\nthe men,--all the foolish fellows were clapping one another on the back\nand crying that here was a proper captain, and there was none quite so\nmad as to dispute them in so many words.\n\nThe smoke grew thick between the decks, and after a while there rose\nthe smell of baking and roasting, and the foolish ones patted their\nbellies and smacked their lips. They whispered about that the boy was\nspreading with a linen cloth the table in the great cabin and that the\ncook's mate was staggering under weight of rich food; and when the cook\ncalled for men to hoist out a cask of such nectar as poor sailors know\nnot the like of, a great cheer went up and there were more hands to\nhaul than there was room on the rope.\n\nThe Old One, leaning on the poop, smiled and Harry Malcolm, coming to\njoin him, smiled too; for they knew well the hearts of sailormen and\ndid nothing without a purpose.\n\nSo the table was laid and the feast was spread and in came the men.\nOnly one remained at the helm, for the wind was light, which made\nlight his task; six remained on deck to watch and stand by, with Harry\nMalcolm curled against the light gun on the quarter-deck to command\nthem; and the cook and his mate, resting from their labours far down in\nthe hold, gorged themselves on good food and drank themselves drunk\non nappy liquor from a cask they had cannily marked for their own\namong the cabin stores. Of the rest, all that could find room crowded\ninto the great cabin, and all that could find no room in the cabin\nsquatted on the deck outside the door on the very spot where Francis\nCandle had fallen dead. They sat with their backs against bulkheads and\nstanchions, where they, too, could join in the feast and the council;\nand the boy, when all were fed, gathered meat from under the table like\nold King Adoni-bezek of unhappy memory.\n\nIt was a sight to remember, for very merry they were and save as they\nwere rough, hard-featured men, a man would never have dreamed they bore\nblood on their hands and murder on their hearts. The Old One sat at the\nhead of the table and took care that neither food nor wine was stinted.\nThe carpenter, his one eye twinkling with pleasure and his beard\nwaggling in his haste lest another should get ahead of him at trencher\nwork, sat on the Old One's right, which was accorded him as a mark of\nhonour since he had accomplished marvels in restoring the planking the\nstorm had torn asunder. A stout seaman of the rescued men, Paul Craig\nby name--it was he who had needed two blows to kill the helmsman--sat\nat the Old One's left and squared his big shoulders over his meat and\nate like a hog till he could hold no more, for he was an ox of great\ngirth and short temper and little wit, who ate by custom more than did\nhim good. Another of gaunt frame, Joseph Kirk by name, sat smiling at a\nman here and a man there and tippled till his head wagged; and off in\na corner there sat a keen little man with a hooked nose, who was older\nthan most of those in the cabin yet had scarcely a wrinkle to mar the\nsmoothness of his shaven face save above and behind his eyes, where a\nfew deep lines gave him the wild look of a hawk.\n\nWhen he spoke, which was seldom, thick gutturals confused his words,\nand always he sat in corners. Does not a man looking out of a corner,\nwith a wall on two sides of him and no one behind him, see more than\nanother? His Christian name was Jacob and most of them knew him by no\nother; but mocking him they called it \"Yacob.\" Further than that, which\nhe took with a wry smile, they refrained from mocking him, for though\nhe spoke little, his silence said much.\n\nThe Old One rose and very sober he was as he held high a brimming can,\nand so steady was his hand that not a drop spilled. For a space he\npaused and looked around at the rough company seated at the long table\nand crouching in the mellow shadows beyond the door, then, \"To the\nKing!\" he cried.\n\nThose not knowing him well, who stared in perplexity at such a toast\nin such a place and time, saw his eyes twinkle and perceived he was\nlooking at old Jacob in the corner. Then old Jacob, smiling as at a\nfamiliar jest, rose in turn and raised his can likewise, and pausing to\nlook about him, cried back at the Old One in his thick foreign voice,\n\"The King and his ships--be damned!\"\n\nA yell of laughter and derision shook the cabin. The one-eyed carpenter\nleaped up first, then such of the rescued men as were not too drunk to\nstand, then here and there men of the Rose of Devon's company, some\neagerly in all earnestness, others having a mind to keep their throats\nin one piece, for they perceived that like enough the unholy toast was\nbut to try their allegiance.\n\nThe Old One's eyes leaped from man to man and his cold voice cut\nthrough the noisy riot of drunken mirth. \"I had said Will Canty was a\nman of spirit, but his can hugs the table when these tall fellows are\ndrinking confusion to the King.\"\n\n\"A hand-napper, a hand-napper! Have him away, my hearts, to the Halifax\nengine,\" Joe Kirk bawled with a drunken leer.\n\n\"Why,\" said Will Canty, and his face was white, but with a red spot on\neither cheek, \"my can, since you say what you say, was dry; and for the\nmatter of that, I am no prating Puritan who wishes ill to the King.\"\n\nOver the rumble of voices the Old One's voice rose loudest: \"See you,\nthen, religious cobblers or preaching button-makers among us?\"\n\n\"And there are others yet besides prating Puritans, mine friend, that\ndrink our toast!\" cried Jacob.\n\nThe Old One then smiled, for he was no man to drive a nail with a\ntwo-hand sledge. But although he changed his manner as fast and often\nas light flickers on running water, under the surface there flowed a\nstrong, even current of liking or ill will, as sooner or later all men\nthat had dealings with him must learn, some to their wonder and some to\ntheir sorrow. \"Enough, enough!\" said he. \"Will's a good lad and he'll\nserve us well when there's powder smoke to snuff. Be you not offended,\nWill. In all faith our ship is a king's ship and more, for are we not\nthirty kings, to fight our own battles and heave out our own flag\nbefore the world and take such treasures as will buy us, each and all,\na king's palace and all the wives a king could wish? Nay, God helping\nus, my hearts, we shall carry home to good Mother Taylor riches that\nwill serve for a sponge to wipe the chalk from every black post in\nCornwall and in Devon, and Will Canty shall drink with us there.\"\n\nThere rose a thunder of fists beating the board and a rumble of\n\"Yea's,\" and the Old One made no end of smiling, but there were some\nwhom his smile failed to deceive.\n\n\"Come, boy, with thy pitcher of sack! Pour sack for all!\" he cried.\n\"Come, ply thy task and let no man go wanting. Fill you Will Canty's\npot.\" He gulped down a mighty draught and wiped his moustaches with\nthumb and forefinger. \"And now, brave lads, let us have our heads\ntogether: though we lie but a hundred leagues off these banks of\nNewfoundland, what say you? Shall we turn our backs on them and take a\nfling at a braver trade? Or shall we taste of fat lobsters and great\ncod, and perchance pluck the feathers from some of these New England\ntowns concerning which there hath lately been such a buzz of talk\nin old England--at Cape Ann, let us say at venture, or Naumkeag, or\nPlymouth Colony?\"\n\n\"Yea, yea! I am for Cape Ann,\" cried Joe Kirk, and his head rolled\ndrunkenly above his great shoulders as he bolstered his opinion with\ncurses. \"Did not my brother go thither, years and years agone, for the\ncompany of Dorchester merchants? Yea, and told rare tales of succulent\ngreat fish, which are a marvelous diet.\"\n\n\"Nay, thy brother was as great a sot as thou,\" a voice put in, and Joe\nrose in anger, but a general clamour drowned his retort and he lapsed\nback into a sodden lethargy.\n\n\"As for me,\" bellowed Martin with bluster and bravado, \"I say go we\nto Plymouth and rap the horns of these schismatic Puritans. Tell me\nnot but that they've mines of rich gold hid away. Did'st ever see a\nRoundhead knave would brave the wild lions of America unless he thought\nthere was gold in't?\"\n\n\"Thou thyself art fool as well as knave,\" quoth the Old One. \"Did'st\nthou not once cry the whole ship's company out of sleep to see a\nmermaid that would entice thee to thy peril? And when sober men had\ncome on deck there was nought there but a seal-fish at play. Lions\nforsooth! In Africa even I have heard a lion roar, but not in America.\nMuch searching of tracts hath stuffed thy head.\"\n\nThe drunken Joe roused sleepily up. \"My brother saw a lion at Cape Ann\nplantation. My brother--\" He drew a knife and wildly flourished it, but\nfell back in a stupor before the laughter died.\n\nMartin's bluster, as was its way when a man boldly confronted it, broke\nlike a pricked bubble, but his sullen glare caught the Old One's eye.\n\nLeaning over the table, the Old One said in a low, taunting voice, \"And\ndid you never see a man dance on air? Ah, there's a sight to catch the\nbreath in your throat and make an emptiness in a man's belly!\"\n\nAs often happens when there has been a great noise and a man speaks in\na low voice, there was a quick lull and the words came out as clear as\nthe ringing of a half crown. Phil Marsham, looking across the table\ninto the Old One's cold blue eyes, which were fixed on Martin, saw in\nthem a flicker of calculating amusement; then he saw that Martin was\nswallowing as if he had a fishbone in his throat.\n\nIn truth Martin wore the sickly smile that a man affects when he is\ncornered and wishes to appear braver than he is. He tried to speak but\nsucceeded only in running his tongue over his lips, which needed it if\nthey were as dry as they were blue.\n\n\"Come, come, we get no place!\"\n\n\"Yacob! Yacob!\" they cried at the sound of his voice, \"Up on thy feet,\nYacob!\"\n\nHe rose and stood in his corner. His long hair was brushed back from\na forehead so high that it reached to a great lump on the crown of\nhis head. His brows were knit with intense earnestness. His big nose\nand curled lips and small chin were set in what might have seemed in\nanother place and another time scholarly intentness. They did him\nhonour by waiting in silence for his words.\n\n\"This bickering and jangling brings us no place. Shall we go on or\nshall we go back? Shall we go north or shall we go south? Those are\nquestions we must answer. Now I will tell you. If we go on, we shall\nfind little fishing ships, with fish and no chinks, and we shall get\ntired of eating fish. If we go back in this fine ship that God in his\ngoodness hath given us, we shall hang. We may yet go back to Mother\nTaylor, but we must go back in another ship. You know why. Now, brave\nhearts, if we go on to New England it shall profit us nothing. For the\nNew-English are poor. They live in little huts. The savages come down\nout of the woods and kill. Whether there be lions I do not know and I\ndo not care; those savages I have seen and they are a very ugly sight.\nThe English plantations are cold in winter like the devil. They are\npoor. The English, they play with poverty.\n\n\"And if we go south? Ah-h-h! There are the Spains! They have sun and\nwarmth and fruits and spices! They have mines of gold and silver\nand stones of great price. While the English play with poverty, the\nSpains play with empires! In New England we shall eat salt cods or\nstarve--which is much the same, for salt cods are a poor diet. But in\nthe South we shall maybe catch a galleon with a vast treasure.\" And\nwith that, very serious and sure of his rightness, he sat down.\n\n\"Yea, Yacob! Yea, Yacob!\" they bawled and delighting in the\nalliteration cried it again, over and over.\n\nPaul Craig, heavy with sated gluttony, piped a shrill \"Yea, Yacob,\"\nand the Old One pounded the table and grinned, for he had sailed many\nseas in Jacob's company. Phil Marsham--nay, and even Will Canty,\ntoo!--pricked ears at the sound of Spanish galleons; for the blue\nCaribbean and the blue hills of the main were fabled, as all knew, to\nhold such wealth as according to the tales of the old travellers was to\nbe found in Cathay or along the banks of the first of the four rivers\nout of Paradise. And was not a Spanish ship fair prey for the most\nlaw-abiding of English mariners?\n\nThere was a hubbub of talk as they sat there, and there was no doubt\nbut they were of one mind to turn their backs on the bleak northern\ncoast and seek a golden fortune in the south. But the council arrived\nsuddenly at an end when down from the deck came the lingering call, \"A\nsa-i-l! A sa-i-l!\"\n\nUp, then, the Old One leaped, and he raised his hand. \"A sail is cried.\nWhat say you?\"\n\n\"Let us not cast away what God hath offered us!\"\n\n\"Yea, Yacob!\"\n\n\"Up, you dogs in the steerage! A hall, a hall!\"\n\nOne fell over on the table in drunken torpor. Another rushed out the\ndoor and tumbled over a sleeper at the threshold.\n\n\"Up, you dogs! How stands he?\"\n\nThey poured out of the cabin to the deck.\n\n\"He stands on the lee bow!\"\n\n\"Bear up the helm! A fresh man at the helm!\" the Old One thundered. He\nsquinted across the sea. \"Come, Harry--here on the poop--and tell me if\nshe be not a ketch. Now she lifts--now she falls. 'Twill be a chase, I\ntake it.\"\n\nThe round little mate came nimbly up the ladder.\n\n\"Helm a-luff!\" said he in his light, quick voice, which at first the\nhelmsman failed to hear. \"Helm a-luff! A-luff, man! Art deaf? The\ncourses hide her. There she lifts! Yea, a ketch. Let us see. It is now\nan hour to sunset. If we stand across her bows and bear a sharp watch\nwe shall come up with her in early evening and a very proper moment it\nwill be.\"\n\nHis light, incisive speech, so unlike the boisterous ranting of the Old\nOne, in its own way curiously influenced even the Old One himself. A\nman who has a trick of getting at sound reasons, unmoved by bluster or\nemotion, can hold his own in any company; and many a quiet voice can\nfire a ship's crew to action as a slow match fires a cannon.\n\n\"Now, young men,\" Martin roared, \"up aloft and loose fore and main\ntopsails. And oh that our stout mizzenmast were standing yet!\"\n\n\"No, no, no!\" cried Harry Malcolm and he almost raised his voice. \"Thy\nhaste, thou pop-eyed fool, would work the end of us all. Think you, if\nthey see us fling every sail to the wind, they will abide our coming\nwithout charging their guns and stationing every gunner with linstock\nand lighted match? Nay, though she be but a ketch, let us go limping\nacross her bows as lame as a pipped hen.\"\n\n\"True, and with every man lying by the side of his gun, where they\nshall not see him until we haul up the ports and show the teeth of\nthe good ship.\" It was Jacob who spoke thus as he climbed to Harry\nMalcolm's side.\n\nThe Old One, looking down at the deck below, touched his mate's arm.\n\n\"Yea, I see them. What do you want?\"\n\n\"It seems,\" said the Old One, \"that our boatswain hath a liking for the\nfellow.\"\n\n\"And that the fellow hath a liking for our boatswain, think you?\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\nJacob thrust his long nose between them. \"'Well,' you say, by which you\nmean 'not well.' It proves nothing that a man will not drink damnation\nto a king.\"\n\nThe three heads met, high on the poop, and now and again they glanced\ndown at the two lads who stood by the waist and watched the distant\nsail, which grew black as the sun set behind it.\n\nThe sun set and the sea darkened and a light flamed up on board the\nchase, which appeared to show her good faith by standing toward the\nRose of Devon.\n\nThere was a rumble of laughter among the men when they perceived she\nhad changed her course. The sober wrung oaths from the drunk by dashing\nbucketfuls of cold water in their faces. The gunners moved like shadows\namong the guns. And high on the poop, three shadows again merged into\none.\n\n\"Master Boatswain,\" the Old One called, but softly, \"do thou take it\nupon thyself, although it lies outside thine own province, to make\nsure that powder and balls and sponges and ladles and rammers are laid\nready.\"\n\nHunching his bent shoulders, Mate Malcolm came nimbly down the ladder\nand from the chest of arms drew forth muskets and pistols.\n\n\"Come, my bullies below there, knock open your ports!\" It was the Old\nOne's voice, but so softly and briskly did he speak that it might have\nbeen Harry Malcolm.\n\nAs the dim figures on deck moved cautiously about, the subdued voice\nagain floated down to them:--\n\n\"Let all the guns be loose in tackles and stand by to run them out when\nthe word is given. Port your helm! Every man to his quarters. Now, my\nhearts, be ready to show your courage and we'll have this wandering\nketch for a consort to our good Rose of Devon.\"\n\nThen Harry Malcolm came in haste along the deck. \"Who's to this gun?\nAnd who to this? Nay, you've a man too many there. Here, fellow, come\nhither! Here a man is lacking. You there, who are playing the part of\ngunner, have you ever heard these bulldogs bark? And understand you the\nbusiness? Good, good!\" And he passed on up the deck. Nought escaped\nhim. In the silence they heard the sound of his voice and the quick\npattering of his feet when they could see no more than that he was\nstill moving among the guns.\n\nThey had come so near the stranger that they must soon hail or be\nhailed, when a figure emerging from the steerage room in the darkness\ncame upon Phil Marsham by the quarter-deck ladder and gave a great\nstart. As Phil turned, the fellow whispered, \"God be thanked it is\nthou! I thought it was another. Come with me to the side--here by the\nshrouds.\"\n\nThe two stepped lightly under the shadow of the quarter-deck to the\nwaist, where the carpenter had nailed in place new planks not twelve\nhours since, and together they raised a bundle. It was on the larboard\nside, and since all had gathered for the moment to starboard to watch\nthe strange ketch, there was no man to observe them. Some one moved\nabove them and they hesitated, then they heard slow steps receding and\nthick undertones that they recognized as Jacob's. When he had gone,\nthe one who had brought the bundle whispered, \"Heave it far out,\" and\ntogether they hove it.\n\nStill in the shadow of the quarter-deck, the two slipped silently back,\nunseen, and when Harry Malcolm came hurrying from one side, and Jacob\nfrom the other, to see what had made the splash, there was no one there\nnor could any man answer their questions.\n\n\"Have you done as you said?\" Phil asked in a breathless whisper.\n\n\"That I have.\" And it was Will Canty who spoke.\n\n\"Then we shall like enough be hanged; but thou art a tall fellow and I\nlove thee for it.\"\n\nThere came over the water a voice distinctly calling, \"Whence your\nship?\"\n\n\"Back to your guns, ye dogs!\" cried Mate Malcolm in a voice that could\nbe heard the length of the deck, yet that was not loud enough to be\nheard on board the stranger.\n\n\"Of England,\" the Old One called from the quarter-deck. \"And whence is\nyours?\"\n\nThere was a space of silence, in which the two vessels came nearer each\nother, and I would have you know that hearts ever so courageous were\nthumping at a lively pace.\n\n\"And yours?\" the Old One cried the second time.\n\nThere came voices and a hoarse laugh from the stranger, then, \"Are you\nmerchants or men of war?\"\n\n\"Of the sea,\" cried the Old One in a voice so like thunder that a man\nwould not think it could have come from his lean throat. \"Run out\nyour guns, O my hearts! Let him have the chase guns first. The chase\nguns--the chase guns!\"\n\nNow one bawled down the main hatch, and another below echoed his cry,\nthen there sounded the quick _boom-boom_ from the bows. The guns had\nspoken and the fight was on.\n\n\"Up your helm--up your helm! Hold your fire now, my hearts, and have at\nthem!\" the Old One cried.\n\nAnd now the voice came again over the restless sea. \"Our ship is the\nPorcupine ketch and our quills are set.\"\n\nThe dark sea tossed and rolled between the vessels and little that\nhappened on board either was visible to the other, so black was the\nnight; but the light of the sky, which the water reflected, made of\neach a black shape clear-cut as of jet but finer than the most cunning\nhand could carve, in which a man might trace every line and rope.\n\nAnd now from on board the ketch jets of flame burst out and after them\ncame smartly the crack of muskets.\n\n\"Now, lads,\" the Old One thundered, \"give fire and make an end of this\npetty galling. Give fire!\"\n\nA gun on the maintop-deck boomed and another followed; but there\nwas confusion and stumbling and all were slow for want of practice\ntogether, and there was time lost ere the third gun spoke. Then, while\nMate Malcolm was storming up the deck and the Old One was storming\ndown, they heard the strange master calling to his gunners; then, to\nthe vast amazement of the men of the Rose of Devon, who had cherished\nthe delusion that their chase was a weak craft and an easy prize, on\nboard the ketch as many as a dozen guns belched flame. Their thunder\nshook the sea and their balls sang through the rigging, and a lucky\nshot struck the Rose of Devon in the forecastle and went crashing\nthrough the bulkhead.\n\nThe ketch then tacked as if to give fire with her other broadside but\ndeftly swung back again and before the Old One or Harry Malcolm had\nfathomed the meaning of it there rose from on board her, the cries of\n\"Bear up and close with him!\"--\"Board him on his quarter!\" \"Have ready\nyour graplins!\"\n\n\"Sheer off, sheer off!\" old Jacob roared. \"Our powder is good for\nnought. Yea, she is in all truth a prickly porcupine.\"\n\n\"If we foul, cut anything to get clear!\" cried the Old One. \"Put down\nyour helm! Veer out your sheets! Cast off weather sheets and braces!\nAloft, there, and clear the main yard where the cut tacklings foul it!\nGood lad, boatswain, good lad!\"\n\nFor on the yardarm Phil had drawn dirk and cut at the snarl of ropes,\nwhere a chance ball had wrought much mischief. Then, as the two vessels\nswung side by side he looked squarely into the eyes of a bearded man in\nthe rigging of the ketch.\n\nThe Old One--give the Devil his due!--was handling his ship in a proper\nmanner and by luffing he had kept abreast of those guns in the ketch\nwhich had spent their charges. But it was plain that the Rose of Devon\nhad caught a tartar. In all truth, she had run upon a porcupine with\nquills set, for though a smaller vessel, the ketch, it now appeared,\ncarried as many men or more, and every man knew his place and duty.\nLooking down on her deck, Phil saw her gun crews toiling with sponges\nand rammers to load anew.\n\nShe was herself, it seemed, a sea rover athirst for blood and in those\nwild, remote seas there was no fraternity among thieves. As the main\nyardarm of the Rose of Devon swung toward her rigging when the ship\nrolled, the bearded man ran a rope about the spar and in a moment the\nvessels were locked abeam and were drifting together till their sides\nshould touch.\n\nPhilip Marsham again drew the dirk that Colin Samson had wrought for\nhim and leaning far out struck at the fellow's breast, who swung back\nto avoid the thrust, which pricked him but did no more. Then the fellow\nsprang to the attack with his own knife in hand, for he had thrown\na knot in the rope, which creaked and tightened; and with a yell of\ntriumph he struck at the lad, who swung to one side and struck back.\n\nIt was a brave fight in the empty air, and the two were like warring\nspiders as they circled and swung in the darkness and thrust each at\nthe other. But the lad was many years the younger, and by so much the\nmore nimble, and his dirk--for which all thanks to Colin Samson!--smote\nthe fellow a slashing blow in the thigh. And while the fellow clung to\nthe shrouds, weak with pain, a second Rose-of-Devon's man came crawling\nover Phil who hung below from the yard, and slashed the rope.\n\n\"We are clear! We are clear! God be thanked!\" the Old One yelled.\n\nMeanwhile the men of the Rose of Devon had succeeded in firing\nthree guns of the larboard broadside, which by the grace of Divine\nProvidence wrought such ruin in the stranger's running gear that the\none crew of rascals was enabled to escape fit retribution at the hands\nof the other. The peak of her great foresail fell and in a moment her\ncut halyards were swept into a snarl that needed time and daylight for\nuntangling.\n\nSo the Rose of Devon slipped past the ketch, whose men were striving\nto clear the rigging and come about in pursuit, and having once evaded\nher erstwhile chase, the old ship ran away in the night. With her\nlights out and all the sail spread that she could carry, and favoured\nby clouds and fog, she made good her escape; but there was grumbling\nforward and grumbling aft, and there was a dead man to heave over the\nside.\n\nIt served Philip Marsham better than he knew that he had fought a duel\non the yardarm; for dark though the night had been, there had happened\nlittle that escaped the Old One's eye; and bitter though Tom Jordan's\ntemper and angry his mood, he was always one to give credit where he\nbelieved it due.\n\nWhen he wiped the blood from the dirk, Phil remembered with gratitude\nthe good smith, Colin Samson. Then he thought of the old lady and\ngentleman at the inn, and of Nell Entick, and bluff Sir John. He would\nhave been glad enough to be out of the Rose of Devon and away, but for\nbetter or worse he had cast his lot in the ship, and though he little\nliked the lawless turn her affairs had taken, a man cannot run away by\nnight from a ship on the high seas.\n\nAll hands stood watch till dawn as a tribute to the war of one pirate\nupon another, and not until the sun had risen and shown no sail in\nsight did the Old One himself go into the great cabin.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\nA BIRD TO BE LIMED\n\n\nA lad being called into council by such a man as Tom Jordan might well\nthink himself a fine fellow, and rare enough were lads whom Tom Jordan\nwould thus have summoned. But although Philip Marsham, it seemed, had\ntaken the Old One's eye and won his heart long before on the little\nhill beside the road, when Phil had drawn the wind from Martin's sails,\nand although it had not escaped Tom Jordan that Phil's hand moved\neasily toward his weapon, the old proverb has it \"a man that flattereth\nhis neighbor, spreadeth a net for his steps\"; and \"he that whistleth\nmerrily, spreadeth his nets cunningly and hunteth after his prey\ngreedily.\"\n\nSo, \"Come, boatswain, and lend us thy wits,\" cried Tom. \"Four heads\nshall provide more wisdom than three.\" And with that, he clapped Phil\non the back and drew him into the cabin where Jacob and the mate sat\ndeep in talk of the night's adventures.\n\n\"A hawk, when she is first dressed and ready to fly,\" said Jacob, \"is\nsharp set and hath a great will upon her. If the falconer do not then\nfollow it, she will be dulled for ever after. So, master, a man! Yea,\nand a ship.\"\n\n\"A great will, sayest thou?\" quoth the Old One, and his voice revealed\nhis sullen anger. \"Why then, in God's name, did ye not rake them with\na broadside or twain?\" With which he turned on Harry Malcolm, thus to\ninclude him in the charge.\n\n\"For one thing,\" replied Malcolm, and testily, for ill temper prevailed\nboth aft and forward, \"we gave the gunners no firing to learn them\ntheir guns. For another thing, the powder failed us. For yet another,\nsince you say what you say, and be cursed for it, 'twere a mad, foolish\nnotion to run afoul a strange ship, for we have but a half the company\nwe need to work a ship and fight. And finally, to cap our woeful\nproverbs, we know what we know--yea,\" and he shot a dark glance from\nunder bent brows, \"we know what we know; there be those who come toward\nus with their feet, but go from us with their hearts.\" His voice, as\nalways, was light and quick, but there was a rumble in it, such as one\nmay sometimes hear in a dog's throat.\n\nAs the three men looked first at one and then at another, there came to\nBoatswain Marsham, sitting as it were outside their circle, the uneasy\nthrobbing of their suspicion.\n\n\"Of the powder,\" said Jacob coolly, \"I have taken a little from each\nbarrel.\" He laid on the table seven packages wrapped in leaves from an\nold book. Regarding closely the notes he had written on each package,\nhe opened them one by one and placed them in a row.\n\n\"This,\" said he, \"is from the barrel that good Harry Malcolm served\nout to the men and that doubtless this man Candle hath used from in\nold days. It hath lost its strength by long lying. Press it with thy\nfingers and thou shalt feel it soft to the touch. Here upon this white\nsheet of paper I lay four corns of this powder. This other powder\"--and\nhe chose a second package--\"is from a barrel new opened. Press it and\nthou shalt see how firm and hard is each corn. And this, too, is firm\nand of a fair azure. And so, also, this. But this--\" and he first put\nhis eyes close to the notes on each remaining packet, then held them\nfar off, for his sight, although good at a great distance, made out\nwith difficulty things near at hand, \"this is from a barrel that hath\nlost its strength by moisture; and this hath a fault I shall tell you\nof.\"\n\nTaking a pinch of each, as he spoke, he had laid the corns, each some\nthree fingers distant from the next, in a circle on the paper. He then\nstruck tinder, and lighting a match made of twisted cords of tow boiled\nin strong lye-ashes and saltpetre, he held it over a corn of the good\npowder. There was a flash and puff, and the ring of powder was gone.\nThe corns of good powder had fired speedily and left only a chalky\nwhiteness in their place, nor had they burned the paper or given off\nsmoke; but the corns of poor powder had burned slowly, and some had\nscorched the paper and some had given forth smoke.\n\nThe Old One softly swore. \"And have we, then,\" asked he, \"but three\nbarrels of good powder?\"\n\n\"Nay, there are more than three. This last is weak because they have\nneglected to turn the barrels upside down, so the petre has settled\nfrom top to bottom, as is its way. We shall find the bottom as strong\nas the top is weak, and by turning the barrel we shall renew its\nstrength evenly.\"\n\n\"As for the powder that hath spoiled by long lying,\" cried Philip\nMarsham, \"I will undertake to make it as good as new.\"\n\n\"Do you, boatswain, mind your sails and cordage,\" said old Jacob,\nwith a wry smile. \"An you wish to grind it in the mortar, that you\nmay; but it is I who will measure the petre. Nay, I will make you, if\nyou wish it for a wonder to show friends, a powder of any colour you\nplease--white, red, blue, or green.\"\n\nOf the three who leaned over the packets of powder, old Jacob was the\nonly one who bore with even temper the sad reverse of the night before;\nfor master and mate glared at each other in such wrath as had thrown a\nshadow over every soul in the ship.\n\nSome had waked with aching heads, for which they had their own folly\nto thank; some were like men who dream they have got a great treasure\nbut wake to find pebblestones or worse under the pillow: since the\nPorcupine ketch had yielded them no gold and had stung them instead\nwith her quills. In all truth the ship was by the ears, for in\nextremities your sea sharks are uncertain friends, as a touch of foul\nweather will manifest to any man's satisfaction.\n\n\"Enough of this,\" said the Old One, and he pushed aside the packets and\nfolded his arms. \"We lose time. There is a thief amongst us.\"\n\n\"A thief, you say?\" And the hot red of anger burned its way across the\nboatswain's face, for the three had turned and looked hard at him.\n\nThe Old One and Harry Malcolm then exchanged quick glances, and Jacob\nshut his small mouth tight and knotted his brows.\n\n\"Well,\" cried Phil, \"would you charge me with theft?\"\n\n\"Some one,\" said the Old One, lingering over each word, \"hath wrought a\nclever plot against us.\"\n\n\"Say on, say on!\"\n\n\"He is a man, I make no doubt, whose buttons are breaking with venom.\"\n\nThere was heavy silence in the cabin. Jacob, pursing his lips and\nknotting his brows, looked from one of them to another, and Phil,\nvaguely on the defensive, drew back and gave them a gaze as steady as\nthey sent.\n\n\"He is doubtless a very cunning rascal,\" Harry Malcolm put in, \"who\nhath cut his cloth by his wits; but he is making a suit that will\nthrottle him by its narrowness about the neck.\"\n\nThe master and mate once more exchanged glances and the Old One then\nsmiled lightly, as if again there were sunlight rippling over dark\nwater.\n\n\"Nay, Philip, we think no ill of thee. But do thou have care to thy\ncompany. A foul trick hath been done with a mind to render us helpless\nat sea, so that we must crawl to the nearest land, where some base\ndunghill spirit is doubtless of a mind to leave our company. But we\nhave resources; yea, and of thee, Philip, we think no ill.\"\n\nDespite their fair words, though, they were watching Philip Marsham\nlike three old tomcats watching a sparrow, and he, being no fool, knew\nthe reason why.\n\nThree hard faces they showed: the one, handsome in a devilish way and\nkeen; the second, unassuming, yet deeply astute and marked by a deeper\nrooted, if less frank, selfishness; the third, older, wiser, more\nself-centred.\n\nThe eyes of master and mate were coldly cruel; but old Jacob was too\nintent on his own thoughts to be cruel save by indifference.\n\nAll that day Jacob squatted on the deck and toiled with tools and wood.\nFrom the wood he chose certain long pieces, fine-grained and straight\nand dry and free from knots, and certain shorter and broader pieces\nthat were suited to his purpose, and bade the carpenter plane them\nsmooth. He laid out scales, working with a small square and a pair\nof compasses, and engraved them with utmost care. He wrought brass\ninto curious shapes by a plan he made, and from morning till night he\nkept at the task, frowning and ciphering and sitting deep in thought.\nHe called for charcoal and a mortar, and beat the charcoal to a fine\npowder and tempered it with linseed oil. This he rubbed into the wood\nhe had shaped to his liking, and watched it a long while, now and again\ntouching it to try it; then with oil from a phial he had found in a\nchest in the great cabin he rubbed the wood clean, and there were left\nin the wood, set off neatly in black, the gradations and figures he had\nso exactly etched.\n\nTaking his work into the great cabin, he toiled on by lanthorn light\nuntil a late hour, and there through the open door men as they passed\nmight see him hunched over the table with his medley of tools about\nhim. But when at last he leaned back and drew a long breath of relief,\nvery serious and very wise, his work was done, and curiously and deftly\ncontrived it was.\n\nOn the table before him there lay a cross-staff, a nocturnal and a\nGunter's scale, \"with which,\" said he, to the Old One, who sat opposite\nhim quietly taking tobacco and sipping wine, \"and with what instruments\nthe thief hath left us, a man can navigate a ship where he will.\"\n\nExamining closely the nocturnal, which was intricately carved and\nengraved, the Old One muttered, as if ignoring Jacob's words, \"I will\nyet lime that bird.\"\n\n\"Though he be never so mad a callant, I misdoubt he will put his head\ninto a noose,\" said Jacob in his thick, serious voice.\n\n\"Be he the one we think or not the one we think, I will set him such\na trap,\" said the Old One, \"as will take the cunningest fox that ever\ndoubled on the hounds.\" And the thin face smiled in a way that was not\npleasant to see.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\nA WONDERFUL EXCELLENT COOK\n\n\nIf an astrologer or an Arabian enchanter could say to a man, \"Beware\nof this or that, for it is a thing conceived of the Devil to work thy\nruin,\" there would be reason for studying the stars or smiting the\nsand. And this, indeed, they do, according to the old tales. But if a\nsailor seek out an astrologer to learn things that shall profit him,\nhe is more likely to find a man grown foolish by much study, who will\nstroke his chin sagely and say, \"Come, let us look into this matter.\nUnder Capricorn are all diseases in the knees and hams, leprosies, itch\nand scales and schirrous tumors, fallow grounds and barren fields,\nox-houses and cow-houses, low dark places near the ground, and places\nwhere sails and materials for ships be laid.\" And while he talks of\nfixed angles and of the Lord of the Ascendant being in the fourth week,\nsome small unsuspected thing may be the very egg on which the Devil is\nsitting like an old black hen to hatch forth a general calamity.\n\nThus certain incidents that shortly thereafter happened are to the\npoint, for although they appeared of little moment at the time, they\nturned the tide of men's lives and made a stir that has to do with the\ncurrent of my tale.\n\nNow the men of the Rose of Devon sighted a sail at high noon when they\nwere a week on their way south, and though she showed her heels and\nran, and though the Rose of Devon lacked her mizzenmast, the strange\nvessel was but a small pink and so slow that they laid her aboard two\nhours before dark. In her crew she had only a dozen men, and sorely\nfrightened they were, as they tossed in the lee of the dark frigate.\nSo to save themselves from a more cruel fate there was scarcely one of\nthem but leaped at the chance to join the Rose of Devon's crew. They\ntumbled up their small cargo of salt fish for Bilbao and hoisted it on\nboard the ship, together with their shallop, and casting their pink\nadrift, they forbore from complaining when their new master and his men\nstole whatever pleased them, from the new men's rings and knives to the\nvery clothes on their backs. So, with her plunder and her recruits, the\nRose of Devon again squared her yards and continued on her course.\n\nThere was, to be sure, one fellow of mean spirit who whined dolefully,\nupon conceiving his present extremity to be distasteful. But another\ngot comfort by knocking him on the head when no one was looking; and\nfinding him dead, the Old One hove him over-board and there was no\nfurther trouble from the fishermen.\n\nYet it was no secret that there was grumbling and complaining forward\namong the gentlemen of the Rose of Devon, so the Old One sent the\nboatswain to summon them aft when the watches were changing.\n\nHe leaned against the swivel gun on the quarter-deck, and looking down\ninto their faces, smiled disagreeably. \"It hath come to my ears,\" said\nhe, \"that one hath a sad tale to tell because we failed to take the\nPorcupine, which, though a mere ketch, outnumbered us in guns and men.\nAnd another hath a sad tale to tell because this pink that late became\nour prize is small and of little worth, though we got from her eleven\nbrave fellows who shall be worth a store of fine gold.\" He looked from\none of his men to another, for they were all there,--Martin and the\ncook, and Philip Marsham and Will Canty, and Paul Craig and Joe Kirk,\nthe one-eyed carpenter and the rest,--and his thin face settled into\nthe many wrinkles that had got him his name. There was none of them,\nunless it might be Harry Malcolm or Old Jacob, who could say surely at\none time or another what thoughts were uppermost in Tom Jordan's shrewd\nhead.\n\n\"Come, now, my hearts of gold,\" he cried, \"let us have an end of such\nfolly. Said I not that these northern fisheries were meat for crows?\nAnd that we must go south to find prey for eagles? We will choose a\nfine harbour by some green island where there's rich fruit for the\npicking and fat fish for the catching, and we will build there a town\nof our own. We will take toll from the King of Spain's ships; we will\ntake us wives and women and gold and wine from the dons of the islands\nand the main. Yea, we will lay up a great store of riches and live in\nfullness of bread and abundance of idleness.\"\n\nSome were pleased, but some doubted still, which the Old One\nperceiving, for he read their faces, cried, \"Nay, speak up, speak up!\nLet us have no fair-protesting friends with hollow and undermining\nhearts.\"\n\n\"Yea, it is a fair tale,\" cried one, in a surly voice, \"but thus far we\nhave blows to show for our pains--blows and a kettle of fish.\"\n\n\"And methinks,\" another growled, \"we shall see more of salt fish and\nbuccaned meat, than of fine wines and gold and handsome women.\"\n\n\"'Tis a swinish thought,\" the Old One retorted; but he smiled when he\nsaid it, so that they took no offense, for of such grumbling he had no\nfear. He was set to catch a bird of quite another feather.\n\nThen old Jacob rose and they were silent to hear him. \"Let us make an\nend of talk,\" said he slowly. \"We are on our way south and to stop or\nturn aside would be nothing but foolishness.\" And with that, although\nthey had expected him to say more, he turned away.\n\nThen, of a sudden, \"Come, Will,\" the Old One cried, singling out his\nman from all the rest, \"what say you?\"\n\nIf Will Canty's face changed at all, it was a whit the paler as he met\nthe Old One's eyes. \"I say,\" he replied, \"that since we have fish on\nboard, we are sure of fish and would do well to eat fish ere we lose\nit.\"\n\n\"There is sooth in thy words,\" quoth the Old One, and he smiled in\nfriendly wise. (But despite his smile, he liked the words little, as\nany shrewd man might have known by his eyes, and Will Canty was no\nfool.) \"Come, cook, and boil us a great kettle of fish.\"\n\nThe rumble of low voices changed to laughter and the cook boldly cried,\n\"Yea, yea, master!\"\n\n\"For our much voyaging and many pains,\" cried the men, as they went\nabout their work, \"we have got a kettle of fish.\" And they laughed\nmightily, for though it was the very thing that before had made them\ngrumble, now they saw it as a droll affair and made of it many jests,\nof which a few were good and more bad, after the manner of jests.\n\nAs for the cook, he called his mate and bade him break out a drum of\nfish and set a kettle to boil, and cuffed him this way and that, till\nthe poor fellow's ears were swollen.\n\nAnd the Old One said to Harry Malcolm, \"Saw you not how deftly the\nfellow twisted out of the corner, and with a sly remark that no one can\ntake amiss? Oh, he is a slippery dog and I am minded to cut his throat\nout of hand!\"\n\n\"Now, that would be very foolish, for where there's one of them,\nthere's always two, and the one will toll the other on until there are\ntwo dogs by the heels instead of one.\"\n\nAt that the Old One laughed harshly, and the two, who were after a\nleft-handed fashion uncommonly congenial, went off well pleased with\ntheir conceit.\n\nDown in the hold the kettle boiled right merrily, and the cook swelled\nwith pride that he had a mate to carry and fetch. He cuffed the poor\nfellow this way, and he cuffed him that. He threw a pan at him when the\nfire smoked worse than common, and he thrust a fistful of flour into\nhis face and down his neck when he let the fire lag. He flung him his\nlength on the floor for spilling a pint of water; and when in despair\nthe lad fled for his life, the cook seized him by the hair and haled\nhim back and put a long knife at his breast and swore to have his\nheart's blood. Oh, the cook was in a rare and merry mood, for he had\ndrunk more sack than was good for him from the cask he had marked as\nhis own; but as he had waxed exceeding gay and haughty, the sack had\ndulled his wits and he was drunker than he knew.\n\n\"Come, thou pig! Thou son of a swine!\" he yelled. \"Ladle out the fish\nand choose of the best for the cabin. Yea, choose in abundance and\nsummon the master's boy and bid him haste. And do thou bestir thyself\nand carry to the men.\" And with that, he fetched the poor fellow a blow\non his head, which knocked him off his feet.\n\nThe fellow ran to do the work and the cook, in vast satisfaction at\nhaving so well acquitted himself, sat down with a goblet of sack and\ntippled and nodded, and kept an ill-tempered eye on the master's boy\nand his own, as with shrewd fear of broken heads they scurried back and\nforth.\n\n\"It is most wonderful excellent sack,\" quoth the cook, and with his\nsleeve he mopped his fiery bald head. \"It was by a happy stroke I\nmarked it for my own. Truly, I had rather be cook than master, for here\nI sit with mine eye upon the cabin stores, from which I can choose and\neat at will, and the captain, nay, the Lord High Admiral of England,\nis himself none the wiser. Fish, sayest thou? Nay, fish is at best a\npoor man's food. I will have none of it.\" And thus he ran on foolishly,\nforgetting as he drank sack, that there was no one to hear him, not\neven his mate. \"Truly, I am a wonderful excellent cook. I may in time\nbecome a captain. I may even become the governor of a plantation and\ntake for a wife some handsome Spanish woman with a wonderful rich\ndowry. She must have an exceeding rich dowry if she will marry me,\nthough. Yea, I am a wonderful excellent cook.\" And the more he drank\nthe more foolish he became.\n\nAfter a while, he cocked his head upon one side; and quoth he, \"I hear\nthem calling and shouting! It seemeth they are singing huzza for me.\nI hear them coming down to do me honour. Truly, I am a most wonderful\nexcellent cook and the fish hath pleased them well. Foolish ones that\nthey are to eat it!\"\n\nThe silly fellow sat with his head on one side and smiled when they\nburst in upon him. \"Hast come for more fish?\" he cried. \"Yonder stands\nthe kettle. Nay, what's that? What's that thou sayest? Nay, fellow,\nth' art mad? Thou know'st not to whom thou speakest.\"\n\n\"Fool! Knave! Scoundrel! Swine!\" they yelled. \"Oh, such a beating as\nthy fat carcase will get. Hear you not the uproar? Think you to cozzen\nus?\"\n\nWith that they seized him, two by the head and two by the feet, and\ndragged him to the ladder. They threw a rope about him and knotted it\nfast and tossed the ends to men at the hatch above, who hauled him,\nsquealing and kicking like an old hog, up on deck. To the cabin they\ndragged him, with all the men shrieking curses at him and pelting him\nwith chunks of fish, and in the cabin they stood him before the table\nwhere the Old One and Harry Malcolm sat, and very angry were they all.\n\n\"Dog of a cook,\" said the Old One, \"for a relish to conclude our meal,\nwe shall see thee eat of this fish that the boy hath brought us.\" And\nhe thrust before the cook a great dish. \"Eat it, every shred, bones and\nall,\" said he, \"or I'll have thee butchered and boiled in place of it.\"\n\n\"Why, now,\" said the cook, somewhat sobered by rough handling and a\ntrifle perplexed, but for all that still well pleased with himself, \"as\nfor the bones, they are liable to scrape a man's throat going down. I\nam reluctant to eat bones. But the meat is good. I rejoice to partake\nof it, for so diligently have I laboured to prepare it that I have\ndenied myself, yea, though I hungered greatly.\"\n\n\"Eat,\" said the Old One and widely he grinned.\n\nLooking suspiciously about him, for there was something in their manner\nthat he failed to understand, the cook thrust his hand into the dish\nand took from it a great slice of fish, which he crammed into his mouth.\n\n\"Eat,\" said the Old One, \"eat, O thou jewel among cooks!\"\n\nA curious look came over the cook's face and he raised his hand as if\nto take the fish out of his mouth.\n\n\"Nay, swallow it down,\" said the Old One. \"Be not sparing. There is\nabundance in the dish. Yea, thou shalt stand there eating for a long\ntime to come.\" And though he smiled, his look made it plain that he was\nin no trifling mood.\n\nThe cook turned pale and choked and gasped. \"Water!\" he cried thickly,\nfor his mouth was too full for easy speech.\n\n\"Nay, much drinking hath wrought havoc with thy wits. Eat on, eat on!\"\n\nProdigious were the gulps by which the cook succeeded at last in\nswallowing his huge mouthful, and great was his distress, for the salt\nin it nearly choked him. \"Water, water!\" he weakly cried. \"Nay, temper\nthine heart with mercy, master! I beg for water--I beseech for water.\"\n\n\"Eat on,\" said the Old One grimly.\n\nThen Harry Malcolm chuckled and the men in the door roared with\nlaughter, but the cook plunked down on his fat knees and thrust out\nboth his hands. \"Nay, master, I cannot hold it down!\"\n\n\"Eat on, O jewel among cooks!\"\n\n\"Nay, master--\"\n\n\"Come, then, lads, and cram it down his hungry throat.\"\n\nThree of them seized him, and one, when he shut tight his mouth, thrust\na knife between his teeth.\n\n\"Blub-bub-blah!\" he yelled. \"I'll eat! I'll eat!\"\n\nThey let him go and he rose and ate. Time and again he gasped for water\nand they laughed; time and again he lagged and the Old One cried, \"Eat\non!\" When at last he stood miserably in front of the empty dish, the\nOld One said, \"For a day and a night shalt thou sit in bilboes with a\ndry throat, which will be a lesson to learn thee two things: first,\nbefore cooking a kettle of fish, do thou bear it well in mind to soak\nout the salt so that the fish be fit for food; and second, by way of\ncommon prudence, do thou sample for thyself the dishes that are cooked\nfor the cabin.\"\n\nThey haled him forward and locked the shackles on his feet and placed\nbeside him a great dish of the fish, that whoever wished might pelt him\nwith it; and there they left him to repent of his folly and forswear\ndrunkenness and whimper for water.\n\nAs the weary hours passed, the sun tormented him in his insufferable\nthirst; but nightfall in a measure brought relief and he nodded in the\ndarkness and fell asleep.\n\nWaking, he would rub his head, which sadly throbbed and would seek by\ngulping to ease his parched throat; and sleeping again, he would dream\nof great buckets of clear water. The voices that he heard buzzed in his\nears as if they were the droning of flies, and hunching himself down\nin his shackles at one end of the iron bar, he forgot the world and\nwas forgotten, since his fat carcase lay inertly in a black shadow and\nthere was nothing to make a man keep him in mind.\n\nHe heard at last a voice saying, \"But nevertheless it becomes you to\nwalk lightly and carefully,\" and another replying, \"I fear him not, for\nall his subtle ways. Much that goes on escapes him.\"\n\nHe stirred uneasily, and opening his eyes, saw that there were two men\nleaning side by side against the forecastle.\n\n\"In the matter of wit, you grant him less than his due,\" said the first\nspeaker. \"And in another matter you charge him with a heavier burden\nthan he needs bear.\"\n\nThe cook stirred and groaned and the first speaker chuckled, at which\nthe cook's gorge rose from anger.\n\n\"O jewel among cooks!\" one of the two called softly, and the unhappy\nman knew by the voice that the speaker was Philip Marsham.\n\nNaming no names and talking in roundabout phrases as people do when\nthey wish one to know their meaning and another not to, the two\ncontinued with no heed at all to the cook, whom they thought a mere\ndrunken lout. And indeed, their undertones were scarcely audible; but\nanger sharpened the cook's ears and his wits, and he lay and ruminated\nover such chance sentences as he got.\n\n\"It puzzled me from the first,\" said the other, \"to see how easily you\nbore with your comrade of the road.\"\n\n\"Why, he is a good soul in his way.\"\n\nThe other gave a grunt of disgust.\n\n\"Nay, it is a wonder to me that a lad with your nice notions ever found\nhis way to sea,\" Phil retorted.\n\n\"And I might never have gone, had not Captain Francis Candle been my\ngodfather.\"\n\n\"As for me, I have seen both sides of life; and, but for a certain\nthing that happened, I might be well enough contented where I am.\"\n\n\"And that?\"\n\nPhil hesitated, for though they had talked freely, as young men will,\nthe question searched a side of Phil's life to which as yet he had\ngiven no clue. \"Why,\" said he, lowering his voice, \"for one thing, I\nsaw for the first time my own grandfather; and for another, I saw a\ncertain old knight who quite won my fancy from such a man as a certain\none we know. Come, let us stroll together.\" And as they walked the deck\nthat night, arm in arm, Phil told his companion what his life had been\nand what it might have been, and mentioned, in passing, the girl at the\ninn.\n\nLeft to his miseries and his thoughts, of which the first were little\nbetter company than the second, the woeful cook turned over and over\nin his fat head such fragments of their talk as he had succeeded in\noverhearing, and to say truth, he made little more out of it all than\nthe speakers had intended. But his parched throat teased his wits to\ngreater effort, and being come to such a state that he would have\nbartered his immortal soul for water, had chance offered, he bethought\nhim of a plan by which, if luck held good, he might escape from his\nshackles.\n\nThe moment for which he waited was a long time coming and he suffered\na great variety of increasing miseries before it arrived; but when\nthe watches changed, he saw among the men newly arrived on deck his\nerstwhile dearest friend, and somewhat reluctantly forgiving his dear\nfriend for belabouring him over the head with a whole salt fish, the\ncook softly called the man by name.\n\nThe fellow came snickering, which made it none the easier to bespeak\nhis aid; but the cook nevertheless swallowed his wrath as well as with\nhis dry throat he could, and whispered to the fellow that he must make\nhaste and tell the master there was news to be imparted in secret.\n\nAt this the fellow held up his hand with thumb thrust between first and\nsecond fingers.\n\n\"Give me no fico,\" wailed the most excellent cook. \"Nay, I have\nstumbled upon a black and hidden matter. Go thou, and in haste, and it\nwill pay thee well.\"\n\nFor a time they bickered in the dark, but there was in the cook's\ndespair a sincerity that finally made the fellow believe the tale; and\nfinding, upon stealing aft, that there was still a light in the great\ncabin, he mustered up his courage and knocked.\n\n\"Enter,\" cried a hard voice.\n\nThe fellow opened the door and peeped in and found the Old One sitting\nalone at the table. Glancing hastily about, and the more alarmed to\nmeet the cold eye of Harry Malcolm who lay on the great bed in the\ncorner of the cabin, he closed the door at his back and whispered, \"He\nswears it's true--that there's foul work afoot. 'Tis the cook who hath\ntold me--yea, and hath bade me tell you. He would say no more--the\ncook, I mean.\"\n\n\"Oh, my good friend, our most excellent cook!\" Meditating, the Old\nOne looked the fellow up and down. \"Here,\" said he, \"strike off his\nshackles and send him in with the key.\" And he threw the fellow the key\nto the locks.\n\nAfter a while the cook came weakly in and shut the door behind him and,\nthrowing the key on the table, fell into a chair.\n\n\"Ah,\" said the Old One, \"what is this tale I have heard news of?\"\n\n\"Water!\" gasped the cook. For though he had managed, by pausing at the\nbutt on his way, to drink nearly a quart, he had no mind the Old One\nshould know of it.\n\nThe Old One smiled. \"Go, drink, if thy tale be worth it; but mind, if\nI deem thy tale not worth it, thou shalt pay with a drop of blood for\nevery drop of water.\"\n\nThe cook shot a doubting glance at the Old One, but went none the less,\nand came back wiping his lips.\n\n\"Have at thy tale,\" said the Old One.\n\nThere was a quaver in the cook's voice, for he was by no means sure of\nhow great a tale he could make, and the master's face gave him small\nencouragement, for from the beginning of the tale to the end the Old\nOne never altered his cold, cruel smile.\n\n\"It was the boatswain and young Canty,\" he said.\n\n\"Ah!\"\n\n\"They was leaning on the forecastle and walking the deck arm in arm and\ntalking of one thing and another.\"\n\n\"And what did they say?\"\n\n\"They talked about some one's slow wit--I could not make sure whose,\nfor they scoffed at me bitterly--and Canty was bepuzzled by the\nboatswain's ways, and he wanted him to do something or other.\"\n\n\"Go on.\" The Old One, grinning coldly, leaned back and watched the\nlabouring cook, who wracked his few brains to make a worthier story.\n\n\"Nay, but I heard little else. Yet, said I, the master must know at all\ncosts.\"\n\n\"What a thick head is thine and how easily seen through and through!\"\nThe Old One laughed. \"Think you all this is worth a second thought? I\nam of the mind to have you skinned and salted. But I forgive you, since\nI have a milkish heart that is easy moved to pity. Get you down to your\nberth and sleep.\"\n\nThe cook departed in haste, but with a fleeting glance at Harry Malcolm\nwhom he feared less only than the master. He was aware that for some\nreason he did not understand, his broken tale had served his purpose.\n\nWhen he had gone the Old One turned about. \"You heard him. What think\nyou?\" said he.\n\nFrom the great bed in the corner, Harry Malcolm raised his head and\nlaughed silently. \"Our able cook was hard pressed for an excuse to get\nout of his ankle rings. Did you hear him slopping at the butt the first\ntime passing? As for his tale, we know what we knew, and no more.\"\n\n\"'Slow wits'! I wonder.\"\n\n\"At Baracao we shall see,\" said Harry Malcolm. \"Neither one nor a dozen\ncan harm us before we raise land.\"\n\n\"And after raising land, which by God's mercy will be soon now, we\nshall see whose wits will nick first when the edges crack together.\"\n\nThe Old One stretched and yawned and Harry Malcolm softly laughed.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\nA LONESOME LITTLE TOWN\n\n\nA light seen in the middle watch gave warning of an unexpected\nlandfall, and calling up the Old One, who had a store of knowledge\ngained by much cruising in those seas, they lay off and on until dawn,\nwhen they made out an island of the Bahamas. It seemed, since by their\nreckoning they were still a day's sail from land, that there was some\nsmall fault in their instruments; but to this they gave little heed,\nand which island it was and what occasioned the light they never knew,\nthough some ventured one guess and some another as they bore past it\nand lifted isle beyond isle. For two days, with the Old One conning the\nship, they worked their way among the islands, and thus at last they\ncame to a deep bay set among hills, which offered a commodious and safe\nanchorage, notwithstanding that on the point that guarded the bay there\nwas the wreck of a tall ship.\n\nIn the shallop they had taken from the fishing pink, the Old One and\nJacob, with four men to row them, went out to the wreck and returned\nwell pleased with what they had found.\n\n\"God is good to us,\" cried the Old One, perceiving that Harry Malcolm\nwaited at the waist for their coming. \"Though her foremast and mainmast\nbe sprung, yet her mizzen is sound as a nut.\"\n\n\"And is it to be fetched out of her unharmed?\"\n\n\"Yea, that it is! Come, Master Carpenter, haul out our broken old stump\nof a mizzen. By this time on the morrow our good Rose of Devon will\ncarry in its place as stout a stick as man can wish. Faith, the ill\nfortune of them whose ship lies yonder shall serve us well.\"\n\nThere was a great bustle in the old frigate, for work was to be done\nthat needed many hands. Some went to the wreck to save masts and spars,\nand others, led by the one-eyed carpenter, toiled to haul out the\nstump. Boatswain Marsham and his mate laid ready ropes and canvas; and\nthe most of the company being thus busied with one task or another,\nMartin and the cook caught a store of fresh fish, which the cook--who\nhad now become a chastened, careful man--boiled for supper, while\nMartin went onshore for fruit that grew wild in abundance and for fresh\nwater from a sandy spring. It was three days instead of one before the\nwork was finished; but meanwhile there was fresh food and water aft and\nforward, and having spent at sea many weary weeks, the men rejoiced to\npass time so pleasantly in a snug haven.\n\nIndeed, a man might have passed a long life in comfort on such an\nisland, and there were many who cried yea, when Joseph Kirk declared\nhimself for building a town there, to which they might return with a\nstore of wives and wines, and from which they could sally forth when\ntheir supplies of either got low, and get for themselves others out of\nthe King of Spain's ships and plantations. But the Old One laughed and\ncried nay. \"I shall show you a town,\" said he, \"in a land as fair as\nthis, but with houses built and ready for us, and with gold piled up\nand waiting, and with great cellars of wine and warehouses filled with\nfood.\"\n\nSo they sailed from the island one morning at dawn and for a week they\npicked their way down the windward passages. At times they lay hidden\nin deep harbours of which the Old One knew the secret; and again they\nstood boldly out to sea and put behind them many leagues of their\njourney. And thus progressing, one night, as they worked south against\na warm breeze scented with the odour of flowers, they sighted on the\nhorizon a dark low land above which rose dimly the shape of a distant\nmountain.\n\nThe men gathered about master and mate and Jacob, then Harry Malcolm\nwent swarming up the rigging and from the maintopsail yard studied the\ndim bulk of the mountain. After a time he cried down to them, \"Douse\nall lights and hold her on her course!\"\n\nFor an hour they stood toward the land, then Malcolm came down from\naloft smiling, and there ran through the ship a great wave of talk.\nThough a man had never sailed those seas before, he would not have\nfound the reason for their talk hard to guess, since there were few\nsecrets on board. Time and distance had made less the grumbling\noccasioned by the disastrous brush with the Porcupine and by the\nlittleness of the profit got from the pink, and they had warmed their\nhearts with the Old One's tales.\n\nBearing to the west, the Rose of Devon skirted the dark shore for\nmiles; but the master and mate were growing anxious lest dawn overtake\nthem before they should reach the hiding-place they sought; and when\nthey rounded a certain wooded point and sailed into a deep, secluded\nbay where a ship might lie for a year unseen,--which put an end to\ntheir fears,--they let go their anchors with all good will and furled\ntheir sails; and at break of day they kedged the ship into a cove that\nmight have been a dock, so straight were the shores and so deep the\nwater.\n\n\"Mind you, Ned,\" or \"Mind you, Hal, the night we landed on Hispaniola?\"\nthe men from the Blue Friggat were saying. And \"'Twas thou at my side\nwhen we stole down through the palms and bottled the garrison in the\nlittle fort.\" And \"Ah, what wine we got that night!\"\n\n\"Yea, and how drunk we got! So that Martin Barwick was of a mind to go\nfight a duel with the captain of the soldiers. And then they burst out\nand drove us all away, and there was an end of our taking towns for a\nlong, long while.\"\n\n\"I will have you know that I was no drunker than any man else,\" Martin\nsnarled, and they laughed uproariously.\n\n\"Come,\" cried another, \"since we have laid our ship in her chosen\nberth, let us sleep while the idlers watch. We shall be off in the cool\nof the afternoon.\"\n\n\"Nay, in the morning!\"\n\n\"Afternoon or morning matters little,\" said old Jacob thickly, in the\ncorner where he sat watching all the men. \"The hour is near when we\nshall lay in the hold a goodly cargo. I know well _this_ town. We need\nonly find two more such towns to get the money to keep us the rest of\nour lives like so many dukes, each of us in a great house in England,\nwith a park full of deer, and the prettiest tavern wenches from all the\ncountry round to serve us in the kitchen.\"\n\nThat day, while the men slept in such cool places as they could find,\nthe cook and the carpenter stood watch; and a very good watch they\nkept, for they were prudent souls and feared the Old One and dared\nnot steal a wink of sleep. But though there was much need that the men\nshould sleep, there was small need of a watch, for the ship lay in that\ndeep cove in the little round bay, with masses of palms on the high\nbanks, which hid her from waterline to truck.\n\nAt mid-afternoon, as the Old One had bade them, the cook and the\ncarpenter called the men, who came tumbling up, quickly awake and\nbreathing heavily, since there was work to be done ere another morning\nbroke, and, like enough, blood to be spilled.\n\nFrom a chest of arms Harry Malcolm handed out muskets and pistols and\npikes. \"This for you,\" he said--\"and this for you--and here's a tall\ngun for Paul Craig. Nay, curse not! Prayers, Paul, shall profit thee\nmore than curses.\"\n\n\"I tell ye what, I'll not carry this great heavy gun,\" quoth he, and\nturned a dull red from anger.\n\n\"Blubububububub!\" one cried, and all laughed.\n\n\"'Tis lucky, Paul,\" retorted Harry Malcolm, \"that Tom Jordan is an\neasy, merciful man, or there's more than one back would bear a merry\npattern in welts.\" He took up another musket--cumbersome, unwieldy\nweapons they were, which a man must rest for firing--and handed it to\nanother. \"And this for you.\"\n\nJacob was turning over and over on his palm powder from a newly opened\nbarrel, and the Old One was leaning on the quarter-deck rail, whence\nhe sleepily watched the small groups that were all the time gathering\nand parting. Will Canty, his face a little whiter than ordinary and his\nhand holding his firelock upright by the barrel, stood ill at ease by\nthe forecastle. The boys lurked in corners, keeping as much as possible\nout of the way, but watching with wide eyes the many preparations.\nAnd indeed it was a rare sight, for the staunch old ship, her rigging\nrestored and her many leaks stopped, lay in her little cove where a\ncool breeze stirred the ropes, and the afternoon sun shone through the\npalms brightly on the deck, and the men moved about bare-armed and\nstripped to their shirts.\n\n\"It would save much labour,\" said the carpenter, \"were we to use this\nfair breeze to go by sea.\"\n\n\"True, carpenter, but a ship coming in from sea is as easy spied by\nnight as by day, whereas a company of men descending from the hills by\nnight will have the fort before the watchdogs bark. And who is there\nwill grudge labour in such a cause?\" The Old One looked about and the\ncarpenter himself nodded assent.\n\nOnly Paul Craig grumbled, and at him the others laughed as they ate and\ndrank.\n\nThey slept again till just before dawn, then, running a plank to the\nshore, they gathered under the palms, for there was need of a last\ncouncil before leaving the ship.\n\n\"We are forty men,\" said the Old One, \"and forty men are all too few;\nbut though it is little likely that any will stumble on the ship in our\nabsence, it is a matter of only common prudence that we post a guard\nere we go.\"\n\n\"Yea, a guard!\" cried Paul Craig. \"I, now, am a very watchful man.\"\n\n\"Nay, but think, Paul, how great a meal thou can'st eat when thou hast\nclimbed up hill and down with thy gun, and how much thou can'st drink.\n'Twould be no kindness to leave thee. We must leave some lithe, supple\nlad who hath no need for the tramp.\" And the Old One chuckled. \"Come,\nPaul and Martin, you shall lead our van.\"\n\nHarry Malcolm met his eye, and he nodded.\n\n\"I name to guard our ship,\" said he, \"the cook and Joe Kirk and Will\nCanty. Do you, lads, load the swivel guns and keep always at hand two\nloaded muskets apiece. Fire not unless the need is urgent, and keep the\nship with your lives, for who knows but the lives of us all are staked\nupon your watchfulness and courage? You, Harry, since you know best the\nroad, shall lead, with Paul and Martin upon either hand; the rest shall\nfollow, and Jacob and I will guard the rear.\" He turned to the three\nwho were to stay. \"If there is good news, I will send men to bring the\nship round to the harbour where, God willing, we shall load her to the\ndeck with yellow chinks. If bad news,--why, you may see us in one day,\nor three, or five,--or maybe never.\"\n\nHe arched his brows and tossed his piece to his shoulder, and with\nJacob at his side, he followed the others, who were already labouring\nunder the weight of their weapons as they filed up the steep acclivity.\nThe Old One and Jacob slowly climbed the wild, rough hill and paused\nuntil the marching column was out of hearing.\n\n\"You are a strange man,\" said Jacob. \"I would wring his neck without\nthought.\"\n\n\"That were a mere brutal jest such as affordeth little joy,\" the Old\nOne replied. \"I will wind him in a tangle of his own working, then I\nwill take the breath from his nostrils deliberately and he will know,\nwhen he dies, that I know what I know.\"\n\n\"You are a strange man.\"\n\n\"I can keep order among the gentlemen better than could any captain in\nthe King's service; and such a game as this sharpens a man's wits. We\nshall see what we shall see.\"\n\nJacob slipped away by himself and the Old One followed his men.\n\nAll that morning, unseen and unsuspected, Jacob sat behind a rock\nwithin earshot of the ship. The palms shielded him and shaded him and\nhe got himself into such a corner that no one could approach him from\nbehind or see him without being seen. And all that morning he neither\nheard nor saw aught worthy of mark until about noon a voice in the ship\ncried out so that Jacob could plainly understand the words, \"One should\nwatch from land. Now a man on the hilltop could serve us well.\"\n\nTo which a second voice replied, \"Go thou up, Will, go thou up! We are\nof no mind to stir.\"\n\nThere came the sound of steps on a plank, then a rattle of pebbles\nand a rustle of leaves; and Jacob rose quickly and followed at a safe\ndistance a man who passed his corner on the way up the acclivity.\n\nReaching the summit, of the hill, where he was safely out of sight from\nthe ship, the fellow--and it was indeed Will Canty--searched the sea\nfrom horizon to horizon; but Jacob, hunting deliberately as was his\nmanner, found a seat a great way off, yet so situated among the trees\nthat he could watch without being seen. For an hour he sat thus in a\nniche in the rocks below and watched Will on the flat ledge above; then\nhe saw him start up of a sudden and look around him very carefully and\ncautiously, and whip his shirt off his back and wave it in the air.\n\nFor a good half-hour Will waved the shirt, stopping now and then to\nrest; but it seemed that nothing came of his waving, for with a sad\nface he put on his shirt and again sat down and presently he returned\nto the ship.\n\nJacob dozed a while longer where he was, having seen all that; for he\nwas a man who could put two and two together as well as another, and\nhe had learned what he wished to know. Then he got up, and seeking out\nthe place where the Old One and his men had passed, he followed after\nthem at a serious, steady gait, which seemed not very fast yet which\nkept plodding so surely up hill and down hill and through gullies and\nover ledges and along beside the sea, that in two hours he had covered\nthe distance the others, burdened with guns and pikes and swords, had\ncovered in three; and before nightfall, following the marks they had\nleft for him, he overtook them resting in a ravine.\n\nNight, which comes so suddenly in the tropics, was about to darken the\nworld, when Jacob gave them a great start by walking silently in upon\nthem as they sat talking in low voices, with their guns lying by their\nsides and their minds on the work that was before them. He nodded at\nthe Old One, who knew well enough what his nod meant, and sat quietly\ndown among them.\n\nThere was but a small moon, and when at nearly midnight they bestirred\nthemselves and ate the last of the sea bread they had brought, the\nlight was dim. But their plans were laid and the hour was come and the\nOld One and Harry Malcolm and Jacob knew the ways they were to go.\n\nThey were more than thirty, and they straggled out in a long line as\nthey climbed the precipitous hill. But those ahead waited at the top\nfor those behind and together, marching in close array, they crossed a\nridge and came into sight of a little town that lay below them among\nhills and mountains.\n\nIt was a dark and silent town, whose houses had a ghostly pallor in\nthe faint light from the crescent moon, and it lay beside a harbour\nwhich shone like silver. There were no lights in the houses and in all\nthe place nothing stirred; but in the harbour a ship lay anchored,\nconcerning which they speculated in whispers.\n\n\"The road lies yonder under the rock,\" said Harry Malcolm.\n\n\"And one man has strayed,\" Jacob whispered. \"I will fetch him.\"\n\nHe stepped back the way they had come, and returned with Paul Craig who\ndragged his gun by the muzzle.\n\nThe fellow's manner betrayed his cowardice and the Old One pushed the\npoint of a knife against his breast. \"If again you stray or loiter,\"\nhe whispered, \"this blade will rip you open like a hog fat for the\nkilling.\"\n\nThough the words were uttered very softly, others heard them, and\nMartin Barwick, whose courage was none of the staunchest, rubbed his\nthroat and swallowed hard.\n\n\"Gold without stint is ours for the taking,\" said the Old One.\n\n\"I have a misliking of yonder ship.\"\n\n\"Nay, she is but one more prize.\"\n\nThey moved down the mountain path toward the town.\n\n\"There are twelve houses,\" said Jacob. \"Two men to a house leaves ten\nfor the fort.\" In the dim light he had missed his count, for the men as\nthey approached the gate of the village had crowded together.\n\n\"No one sleeps in the fort,\" quoth Harry Malcolm in a low voice. \"They\ngo to the fort only when they are attacked by dogs of English or wicked\npirates.\"\n\nSome one laughed softly.\n\n\"Two men to a house,\" the Old One was saying. \"Kill, plunder, and\nburn!\" Then as they stood in the very gate a dog barked.\n\nThey jumped at the sound, but higher by far did they jump when from the\nship lying in the harbour there came a loud hail in Spanish.\n\n\"Ha! The dogs are wakeful!\" the Old One cried in double meaning, and\nwith that he plunged forward through the shadows. Though for the most\npart he showed himself a shrewd, cautious man, he was not one to turn\nback when his blood was up; and quicker than thought he had raised his\nvoice to a yell:--\n\n\"Come, my hearts, and burn them in their beds!\"\n\n\"Nay, nay!\" cried Jacob. \"Come back while there is yet time! They\ncannot yet know who we are or from whence we come. Another day, another\nmonth, will be best!\" But they had gone. With a yell the Old One had\nled the way, and they had followed at his heels. Jacob was left alone\nin the dark, and being a rarely prudent man and of no mind to risk his\nneck lightly, he stayed where he was.\n\nAs the Old One stormed the first house, there came a shot from the\ndarkness and he gave a howl of pain and rage. Turning, Phil Marsham saw\na stranger cross the road behind him, but he had no time to consider\nthe matter, since the first cries had waked the town. A dozen men were\nexchanging musket-shots with the fort, wherein they were folly-blind,\nfor their shots went wild in the dark and their guns took a long time\nloading; and the Old One, thinking to further the attack and not\nconsidering that the light would reveal their whereabouts and their\nweakness, struck fire to dry grass, which blazed up and caught wood,\nbut went out, hissing, under a bucket of water from within a house.\nHere a Rose-of-Devon's man took the steel and died, and there another\nwent down, hit by a musket-ball. In a lull in the firing--for the\ncharges of their guns were soon spent--they heard plainly the sound of\noars and saw that two boats were bringing men from the vessel in the\nharbour, and from the far side of the place others came charging with\npikes and swords. In all truth, the town was aroused and the game was\nover, so they took to their heels and ran for their lives, since they\nwere outnumbered and outfought and no other course was left them.\n\nAll who escaped gathered on the hill, for though a man might wish in\nhis heart to leave the Rose of Devon for ever, he could find no refuge\nin the nest of hornets they had stirred to fury, since in the eyes of\nthe enemy one must appear as guilty as another. So, leaving ten of\ntheir number behind them, dead or wounded or captured, every man who\ncould walk started back for the Rose of Devon with the thought to cheer\nhim on, that after daybreak in all likelihood the howling pack would be\nat his heels.\n\nThey bickered and wrangled and cursed, and one whispered to Philip\nMarsham that if they had an abler captain their luck would turn, which\nwas a great folly and cost him a broken head.\n\n\"That for thy prattle,\" the Old One cried, for he had been walking just\nbehind. And with a club he struck the fellow a blow that sent him to\nthe ground. Indeed, the Old One had intended to kill him, and had he\nnot been so weary, he would doubtless have stayed to complete his work,\nfor his temper was torn to rags.\n\nUphill and down they went, through thickets and streams, over ledges\nand sandy slides, round dank old fallen logs and along firm beaches,\nback to their dark frigate, with their labour for their pains. And so,\nby broad daylight, weary and hungry and too angry for civil speech,\nthey came to the Rose of Devon. The younkers trotted along, dog-tired,\nand the men tramped in as best they could. There were hard words on\nthis side and hard words on that, and hands were clapped on knives for\nno cause at all.\n\nThey thought it queer, when in the gray morning they came sliding down\nto the ship, with a rattle of pebbles and loose earth, that they found\nher so still, and only the cook on her deck, and himself in a cold\nsweat of fear.\n\n\"I would have nought to do with it,\" he cried, and being still mindful\nof his thirsty hours in bilboes, he shook in his shoes lest they fix\nupon him a share of the blame for that which had occurred in their\nabsence.\n\n\"With what and whom would'st thou have nought to do?\" the Old One\ndemanded, and he showed a face that made the cook's teeth rattle.\n\n\"With them--they've gone.\"\n\n\"Who hath gone?\"\n\n\"Will Canty and Joe Kirk. They took the shallop and bread and beer.\"\n\n\"It seems,\" said the Old One, and in a strangely quiet voice, \"that the\nedge that is nicked is not Will Canty's. Is it thine, Jacob, or mine?\"\n\nThe cook thought that either he or the Old One had lost his wits, for\nhe made no sense of the words; but Harry Malcolm and Jacob knew what\nwas meant, and Philip Marsham made a sharp guess at it.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\nTHE HARBOUR OF REFUGE\n\n\nIt was up anchor and away, for they needs must flee ere the hunters\nfind them. They stood along the coast with a light breeze in the early\nmorning, when the sun was rising over the sea and tipping with gold\nthe branches of the dark palms; but the Rose of Devon was a hawk with\nclipped wings.\n\nA company of twenty-nine or thirty men in a staunch ship with a\ngoodly number of brass cannon and with powder and balls in abundance\n(which provident merchants had bought to defend their venture against\npirates!) might have done very well on a merchant voyage or fishing. If\nthere are not too many to share in the adventure, a man can earn his\nwages by the one; or if he would go to the banks of Newfoundland or to\nMassachusetts Bay, his lay of a fishing voyage will doubtless bring\nhim enough golden chinks to drink in strong ale or sack the health of\nevery fair maiden of Plymouth ere he must be off to fill his pockets\nanew. Though the times be ever so hard, he is a feckless sailor who\ncannot earn in such a company the price of drinking the three outs.\nBut to work a ship and lay aboard a rich prize, with perhaps need to\nshow heels to a King's cruiser or to fight her, is quite another game;\nand the Old One and Harry Malcolm, who had their full share of the\nill-temper that prevailed throughout the ship, cursed their fortune,\neach in his own way, and wrangled together and quarrelled with the men.\n\nAnd indeed, among all the men of the Rose of Devon there were only two\nor three who that morning remained unperturbed by their misadventures\nof the night. One was Jacob, who sat in this corner or that and eyed\nall comers coldly and as if from a distance. A second was Philip\nMarsham, who did not, like Jacob, appear to lose his warmer interest in\nthe ship and her company, but whose interest had been always less as\nfor himself alone.\n\nMeeting in groups of three or five, the men ripped out oaths and told\nof how one captain or another had once taken a ship or a town with\nvast bloodshed and plunder, and thus they stormed about the deck at\nintervals until an hour after sunrise, when Phil from the forecastle\nand Old Jacob from his corner under the quarter-deck, having observed\nthem for some time putting their heads together and conversing in\nundertones, heard them crying out, \"Yea, yea! Go on, go on! We are\nall with you!\" Four of the men then started through the steerage room\nto the great cabin and the rest gathered in a sullen half circle just\nunder the quarter-deck.\n\nJacob raised his head and listened; his face was very thoughtful and\nhis small mouth was puckered tight. At the sounds that issued from the\ncabin, Phil himself drew nearer.\n\n\"Well,\" cried the Old One in a voice that seemed as full of wonder as\nof wrath,--they heard him plainly,--\"what in the Devil's name mean ye\nby this?\"\n\n\"We ha' lost a dozen men and our shallop by this foolish march, and\nfrom this rich town of which you have promised much we have got only\nblows and balls for our labour.\" The speaker's voice was loud and\nharsh, and he larded his speech with such oaths and obscene bywords\nas are not fit for printing. \"We are of a mind to change captains. You\nshall go forward and Paul Craig shall come aft. Speak up, Paul! Tell\nyour tale of no marching to wear out a man's feet--\"\n\nThere came a string of oaths in the Old One's voice and a wild stamping\nand crashing; then out they burst, jostling one another in their haste,\nand after them the Old One with a clubbed musket.\n\nHe subdued his fury, when he faced the ring of sullen men, as if he had\ntaken it with his hands and pushed it down. But they feared him none\nthe less, and perhaps the more. A man looking at him must perceive that\nhis mind was keen and subtle, which made his quietness, when he was\nangry, more terrible than a great show of wrath.\n\n\"I have sailed before with mad, fickle crews,\" said he; \"yea, once\nwith a crew so mad that it would send a gentleman post unto the King\nwith a petition of grievances because a King's ship had chased us from\nthe South Foreland to the Lizard. But never saw I a more mad crew than\nthis, which is enough to give a man a grievous affliction of the colic\nand stone by the very excess of its madness.\"\n\n\"As for madness,\" cried a man who stood at a safe distance behind the\nrest, \"I charge thee with worse than madness. We have lost two fights\nand many men and have got to show for it--a kettle of fish.\"\n\nSome laughed, but more muttered angrily.\n\n\"Why--we have had our ill fortunes. But what gentlemen of the sea have\nnot? Come, make an end of this talk. Come out, you who spoke, and let\nus consider the matter. Nay? He will not come, though by his speech he\nis a bold man?\"\n\nAgain some of them laughed, but in a mean way, for he had cowed them by\nhis show of violence and they feared more than ever that subtle spirit\nwhich over-leaped their understanding.\n\n\"Listen, then, my hearts of gold: we will come about and sail back.\nWe will lie tonight by the very town that last night we stormed. We\nwill seek it out as a harbour of refuge. We will tell them a tale of\nmeeting pirates who captured our shallop and part of our men. We will\ngive them such a story that they will think we have met the very men\nthey themselves last night beat off, and will welcome us with open arms\nto succour our distress. Who knows but that we can then take them by\nassault? Or if for the time they are too strong for us, we will mark\nwell the approaches and the defenses, and some night we will again come\nback.\"\n\nThe idea caught their fancy, and though a few cried nay and whispered\nthat it was the sheerest madness yet, more cried yea and argued there\nwas little risk, for if worst should come to worst, they could turn\ntail and run as run they had before. As they talked, they forgot their\nmany woes and whispered about that none but the Old One would ever\nthink of such a scheme.\n\nHarry Malcolm and the Old One went off by themselves and put their\nheads together and conversed secretly, and throughout the ship there\nwas a great buzz of voices. Only Jacob, who sat in his corner and\nwatched now one and now another, and Philip Marsham, who watched Jacob,\nkept silence amidst the hubble-bubble.\n\nSo they wore ship, and returning along the palm-grown shores, came\nagain at the end of the afternoon into sight of the flat mountain they\nhad seen first by night; and though the wind fell away at times until\nthe sails hung in listless folds, they gathered speed with the evening\nbreeze and came at nightfall into a fine landlocked harbour with the\ntown at its head, where there were lights shining from the houses and a\nship still lying at anchor.\n\nUpon their coming there was a great stir in the town. They saw lights\nmoving and heard across the water voices calling; but though the men\nof the Rose of Devon stood by their guns, ready to lift the ports at a\nword and run out their pieces, they laughed in their sleeves at their\nown audacity whereby they hoped greatly to enrich their coffers.\n\nThen one in the fort hailed them in Spanish, and while the Old One\nmade answer in the same tongue, those who understood it whispered to\nthe rest that he was giving the men in the fort a sad tale of how the\nRose of Devon had fallen in with a band of sailors of fortune who had\nkilled part of her men and would have killed them all had not the Old\nOne himself by a bold and clever stroke eluded them. The Old One and\nthe man in the fort flung questions and answers back and forth; and as\nthey talked, the men at the guns relaxed and softly laughed, and Martin\nwhispered to Philip Marsham, \"Yea, they are telling of a band of roving\nEnglishmen who last night singed their very whiskers; and being clever\nmen and learning that them whom we ourselves have met and fought were\nlawless English dogs, they perceive we needs have met the very rascals\nthat made them so much trouble.\" Again Martin listened, then slapped\nhis thigh. \"They are sending us boats!\" he exclaimed. \"Though they\nperceive we are English, it seemeth they bear an Englishman no ill will\nbecause he is English. Truly, a fool shall be known by his folly!\"\n\nMost of the men were elated, but old Jacob watched and said nought. His\nblack, bright eyes and his nose, which came out in a broad curve, made\nhim look like an old, wise rat.\n\nAs the boats came over the dark water, with the soft splash of oars,\nthere was hurried talking on the quarter-deck, then the Old One came\nswiftly. \"Good boatswain,\" said he, \"these foolish fellows have bade us\nashore to break bread with them and share a bottle of wine. Now I am\nof a mind to go, and Harry Malcolm is of a mind to bear me company. We\nwill take twelve men and so arrange it that they shall not surprise us.\nYea, I am too old a dog to be caught by tricks. It may be we can strike\nthem again tonight, and a telling blow. It may be not. But do you and\nJacob keep watch on board, with every man at his station in case of\nneed.\"\n\nSo the Rose of Devon let go her anchors and swung with the tide a\ncable's length from the unknown ship, which lay dark and silent and\napparently deserted.\n\nThe strange boats came up in the shadow of the poop and the Old One and\nHarry, with their men mustered about them, exchanged greetings with the\noarsmen below, in rough English and in rougher Spanish, as each side\nstrove to outdo the other in civility.\n\nThe men--heavily armed--slid down into the boats and the Old One\nsmiled as he watched them go, for he was himself well pleased with\nthe escapade. Such harebrained adventures were his bread of life. He\nfollowed the men, the cabin lanthorn in his hand, and after him came\nHarry Malcolm, as cool as a man could desire, and watched very sharply\nall that went on while the boats rowed slowly away toward the land.\n\nThen Jacob came out of his corner and spoke to Phil. \"I will watch\nfirst,\" said he. \"The cook hath laid a fine supper on the cabin table.\nGo you down and eat your fill, then come up and keep the deck and I\nwill go down and eat in my turn.\"\n\nAt something in the man's manner, which puzzled him, Phil hesitated;\nbut the thought was friendly, and he said, \"I will not be long.\"\n\n\"Do not hurry.\"\n\nWhen Phil turned away, old Jacob cleared his throat.\n\n\"Boatswain--\"\n\n\"Yea?\"\n\n\"Do not hurry.\"\n\nAs Phil sat at the table in the great cabin, which was so dark that he\ncould scarcely see the plate in front of him (although he ate with no\nless eagerness because of the darkness), the planks and timbers and\ntransoms and benches were merged into an indiscriminate background\nof olive-black, and there hung before him by chance a mirror on the\nforward bulkhead, in which the reflection of the yellow sky threw into\nsharp outline the gallery door at his back. Having no means at hand for\nstriking a light, he was hungrily eating and paying little heed to his\nsurroundings, when in the mirror before his eyes, against the yellow\nwestern sky the silhouette of a head wearing a sweeping hat appeared\nover the gallery rail.\n\nThere was not the faintest noise, and no slightest motion of the ship\nwas perceptible in the brown stillness of the evening. The head, darkly\nsilhouetted, appeared in the mirror as if it were a thing not of this\nearth, and immediately, for he was one who always kept his wits about\nhim, Phil slipped silently off the bench, and letting himself down\nflat on the deck, slid back into the darkest corner of all, which lay\nto the starboard of the gallery door. There, without a sound, he rose\nto his feet.\n\nThe black silhouette reflected in the mirror grew larger until it\nnearly blocked the reflection of the door, then a board in the gallery\ngently creaked and Phil knew that the man, whoever he was, was coming\ninto the cabin. Presently in the subdued light he could dimly see the\nman himself, who stood by the table with his back toward Phil and\nglanced about the cabin from one side to the other. Knowing only that\nhe was a stranger and therefore had no right to enter the great cabin\nof the Rose of Devon, Phil had it in mind to jump and seize him from\nbehind, for so far as he could appraise the man's figure, the two were\na fair match in weight and height. But when Phil was gathering himself\nfor the leap, he saw in the mirror the reflection of a second head, and\nthen of a third.\n\nAgain the gallery creaked, for the newcomers, like the first, were\non their way into the cabin. By the door they stood for a moment\nlistening, and in the silence Phil heard a boat gently bumping against\nthe side of the ship. He was first of a mind, naturally, to cry an\nalarm; but were he to call for help, he would learn no more of their\nerrand. They drew together beside the table and conversed in whispers\nof which Phil could distinguish nothing, although he was near enough\nto reach out his hand and seize hold of the curls and brave hat of the\nnearest of them. To attack them single-handed were an act of plain\nfolly, for they wore swords and doubtless other weapons; but when he\nperceived that the first had got out flint and steel, he knew that they\nmust soon discover him.\n\n\"Whence and for what have you come?\" he said in a low voice.\n\nThey turned quickly but with admirable composure: there were never seen\nthree calmer men. The first struck light to a slow match and held over\nit the wick of a candle drawn from his pocket, upon which the flame\ntook hold and blazed up, throwing curious shadows into the corner of\nthe cabin and half revealing the hangings and weapons. The man raised\nthe candle and the three drew close about Phil and looked at him\nsteadily.\n\n\"So a watch is set in the cabin, I perceive,\" the man holding the\ncandle said with a quiet, ironical smile.\n\nBy mien and speech Phil knew upon the instant that they were Englishmen\nand it took no great discernment to see that they were gentlemen and\nmen of authority.\n\nThey pressed closer about him.\n\n\"Whence and for what have you come?\" he repeated.\n\nThey made no reply but stood in the brown light, holding high their\ncandle and looking him hard in the face.\n\nAgain he heard the boat bumping against the side of the ship and\nnow the murmur of the wind aloft. Far away he heard a faint sound\nof calling which was growing constantly louder. The three exchanged\nglances and whispering to one another, moved toward the gallery; but as\nthey started to go, the one turned back and held the candle to Phil's\nface.\n\n\"Of this be assured, my fine fellow,\" said he, \"I shall know you well\nif ever I see you again.\"\n\nPhil was of a mind to call after them, to pursue them, to flee with\nthem; but as it is easy to understand, there were strong reasons\nfor his staying where he was, and there had been little welcome in\ntheir faces. He stood for a moment by the table and noticed that the\nsky in the mirror had turned from a clear olive to a deep gray and\nthat the lines of the door and the gallery rail had lost their sharp\ndecisiveness and had blurred into the dark background. Then he darted\nout of the cabin through the steerage and called sharply, \"Jacob!\nJacob!\"\n\nThe men watching at the guns stirred in suppressed excitement and\nturned from whispering uneasily.\n\n\"There are strange sounds yonder, boatswain,\" called one.\n\n\"And shall we knock out the ports and loose the tacklings?\" another\nasked.\n\n\"Be still! Jacob, Jacob!\" Phil cried, running up on the quarter-deck.\n\nThere was no one on the quarter-deck; there was no one on the poop. The\nwind was blowing up into a fair breeze and small waves were licking\nagainst the dark sides of the Rose of Devon. But the after decks were\ndeserted.\n\n\"Jacob!\" Phil cried once more, and sent his voice out far across the\nwater. But there was still no answer. Jacob had gone.\n\nFor a moment the lad stood by the rail and intently listened. The\ncalling on shore had ceased, but a boat was rowing out from the town\nand the beat of oars was quick and irregular. Further, to swell his\nanxiety, there was a great bustle on board the unknown ship, which had\nbeen lying hitherto with no sign of human life.\n\nThen Philip Marsham took the fate of the Rose of Devon in his hands and\nleaned out over the quarter-deck gun. \"Holla, there!\" he called, but\nnot loudly, \"Let the younkers lay quietly aloft and lie ready on the\nyards to let the sails fall at a word.\"\n\nSeeming encouraged and reassured by a summons to action, the younger\nmen went swarming up the rigging, and as quietly as one could wish; but\neven the low sound of their subdued voices drummed loud in the ears of\nthe lad on the quarter-deck.\n\nJacob had gone! The boatswain, for one, remembered old tales of rats\nleaving ships of ill fortune.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\nWILL CANTY\n\n\nThey saw a boat coming a long way off, with her men rowing furiously,\nbut by that time there were all manner of sounds on the shore whence\nthe boat had launched forth. Shouts and yells in English and Spanish,\nwith ever the booming of guns, echoed across the harbour. Beacons\nflamed up and for a while danced fitfully, only to die away when those\nwho tended the fires left them unwatched and with flaming brands joined\nin the cry; and in the wake of the furiously rowing boat came others\nthat strove with a great thresh of oars to overhaul the fugitive.\n\nThe activity and tumult were very small and faint under the bright\nstars in that harbour girdled about with palms. Though the rugged\nslopes of wild mountains, rising like escarpments above the harbour,\nby day completely dwarfed it, yet the stars made the mountains seem by\nnight mere pigmy hills, and even the many sounds, which a great echoing\nredoubled, seemed smaller and fainter in the presence of the vast\nspaces that such a night suggests.\n\nAlthough the men in the foremost boat rowed out of time and clumsily,\ntheir fierce efforts kept them their lead, and they were still far in\nadvance of their pursuers when they tossed up their oars and crouched\npanting on the thwarts in the shadow of the ship.\n\n\"Ropes, you fools!\" the Old One called. \"Cast us ropes! Ropes! Bind\nfast this bird we've caught and trice him up! Now, my hearts, swing him\naloft--there he swings and up he goes! Well done! I'll keep him though\nI risk my neck in doing it. Make fast a rope at bow and at stern! Good!\nEvery man for himself! Up, thou! And thou! Up go we all! Come, tally on\nand hoist the boat on board! And the men are aloft? Well done, Jacob!\nHaul up the anchor and let fall the courses!\"\n\nIt was plain from their manner that those who came swarming up\nthe sides had a story to tell, but there was little time then for\nstory-telling. The pursuing boats lifted their oars and swung at a\ndistance with the tide, since it was plain for all to see that they\nwere too late to overhaul the fugitives. Although on board the stranger\nship there were signs and sounds of warlike activity, she too refrained\nfrom aggression; and the Old One, having no mind to traffic with them\nfurther, paced the deck with a rumble of oaths and drove the men alow\nand aloft to make sail and be gone.\n\nIt was \"Haul, you swine!\"\n\nAnd \"Heave, you drunken dogs!\"\n\nAnd \"Slacken off the weather braces! Leap for your lives!\"\n\nAnd \"Haul, there, haul! A touch of the rope's end, boatswain, to stir\ntheir spirits!\"\n\nAnd \"Come, clear the main topsail! Up aloft to the topsail yard, young\nmen! A knife, you dog, a knife! Slash the gaskets clear! A touch of the\nhelm, there! Harder! Harder! There she holds! Steady!\"\n\nThen Harry Malcolm called from the quarter-deck in his quiet, quick\nvoice, \"The swivel gun is loaden, Tom. I'll chance a shot upon the\nadvantage.\"\n\n\"Good, say I!\" quoth the Old One. \"And if the first shot prove ill,\namend it with a second.\"\n\nThey saw moving on the forecastle the light of a match, and after such\nbrief space of time as a spark takes to go from brace-ring to touchhole\nthe gun, which was charged with small shot for sweeping the deck if an\nenemy should board the ship, showered the distant boats with metal.\nThey saw by the splashing that the charge had carried well and that\nMalcolm's aim was true, and a yell and a volley of curses told them as\nwell as did the splash, which was dimly seen by starlight, that the\nshot had scored a hit.\n\nWhile a sailor sponged the gun, Harry Malcolm gave a shog to the full\nladle of powder, and keeping his body clear of the muzzle, put the\nladle home to the chamber, where he turned it till his thumb on the\nladle-staff was down, and gave it a shake to clear out the powder, and\nhaled it forth again. Then with the rammer he put the powder home and\ndrove after it a good wad and in anger and haste called for a shot.\n\nThen the Old One laughed through his teeth. \"Go thou down, Jacob,\"\ncried he, \"and give them a ball from the stern chaser. To sink one of\nthose water snakes, now, would be a message worthy of our parting.\nJacob! Jacob, I say!\"\n\nThere was no answer from old Jacob.\n\nIt was Boatswain Marsham who cried back, \"He hath gone.\"\n\n\"Gone?\" quoth the Old One. His face, as the starlight revealed it, was\nnot for the reading, but despite him there was something in his voice\nthat caught the attention of the men.\n\n\"Gone?\" the Old One repeated, and leaned down in the darkness. The\nshadows quite concealed his face when he was bent over so far that no\nlight from above could fall on it, but he raised his hand and beckoned\nto the boatswain in a way there was no mistaking.\n\nIn response to the summons of the long forefinger, Phil climbed the\nladder to his side.\n\n\"You say he hath gone,\" the Old One quietly repeated. \"When did he go?\"\n\n\"I do not know. He kept the deck when I went below for supper.\"\n\n\"How did he go?\"\n\n\"Nor do I know that. But three men came into the cabin by way of the\ngallery while I was there--\"\n\n\"Three men, say you? Speak on.\" The Old One leaned back and folded his\narms, and though he smiled, he listened very carefully to the story the\nboatswain told.\n\n\"And when you came on deck he was gone.\" The Old One tapped the rail.\n\"You have booklearning. Can you navigate a ship?\"\n\n\"I can.\"\n\n\"Yea, it may well be that now we shall have need of such learning.\nIt was an odd day when you and I met beside the road. I shall not\nsoon forget that ranting fool with the book, who was as good as a\nbear-baiting to while away an afternoon when time hung heavy. Oft ha'\nwe left him fallen at the crest, in the old days when he dwelt in\nBideford, but Jacob saw no sport in it, nor could he abide the fellow.\"\nThe Old One looked Phil frankly in the eye and smiled. \"In faith, I\nhad a rare game that day with Martin, whose wits are but a slubbering\nmatter at best. But that's all done and away with. And Jacob hath gone!\nLet him go. Betide it what may, there is one score I shall settle\nbefore my hour comes. Go forward, boatswain, and bear a sharp watch at\nsea, and mind you come not abaft the mainmast until I give you leave.\"\n\nThe Old One spoke again when Phil was on the ladder. \"Mind you,\nboatswain: come not abaft the mainmast until I give you leave. I bear\nyou nought but love, but I will have you know that in what I have to do\nI will brook no interruption.\"\n\nThough Tom Jordan had spoken him kindly, the lad was not so blunt of\nwit that he failed to detect suspicion in the man's manner. He stopped\nby the forecastle, and looking back saw that the Old One was giving\nthe helmsman orders, for the ship had cleared the harbour, to all\nappearances unpursued, and was again bearing up the coast. The Old One\nthen came down from the quarter-deck, and, having spoken to several of\nthe men in turn, called, \"Come, Martin; come, Paul, bring the fellow\nin.\"\n\nAnd with that, he went into the great cabin, where they heard him\nspeaking to Harry Malcolm.\n\nAs for Martin Barwick and Paul Craig, they went over to where the one\nhad all this time been lying whom they had trussed up in ropes and\nhoisted on board. All the time he had been in the ship he had neither\nmoved nor spoken, nor did he speak now as they picked him up, one at\nhis head and one at his feet, and carried him into the cabin. The door\nshut and for a long time there was silence.\n\nThere were some to whom the matter was a mystery, and the boatswain was\namong them; but the whispering and nodding showed that more knew the\nsecret than were ignorant of it. The ship thrust her nose into a heavy\nswell and pitched until her yards knocked on the masts; the breeze\nblew up and whipped the tops off the waves and showered the decks with\nspray; the sky darkened with clouds and threatened rain. But in the\nship there was such a deep silence as stifles a man, which endured and\nseemed--were it possible--to grow minute by minute more intense until a\nlow cry burst from the cabin.\n\nThe men sitting here and there on deck stirred and looked at one\nanother; but Philip Marsham leaped to his feet.\n\n\"Sit down, lad,\" said the carpenter.\n\n\"Drop your hand!\"\n\n\"Nay, it is better that I keep my hand on your arm.\"\n\n\"Drop your hand! Hinder me not!\"\n\n\"Nay, I am obeying orders.\"\n\nThere came a second cry from the cabin, and Phil laid his free hand on\nhis dirk.\n\n\"Have care, boatswain, lest thy folly cost thee dear. There are others\nset to watch the deck as well as I.\"\n\nAnd now three men who had been sitting by the mainmast rose. They were\nlooking toward Phil and the carpenter, and one of them slowly walked\nthither.\n\nThough Philip Marsham had no fear of hard fighting, neither was he an\narrant fool, and instantly he perceived that he was one man against\nmany under circumstances that doubled the odds. His heart beat fast and\na cold sweat sprang out on his forehead.\n\n\"What are they doing to him?\" he demanded.\n\n\"Nothing that he hath not richly earned,\" said the man who had come\nnear the two.\n\nScarcely conscious of his own thought, Phil glanced toward the dark and\ndistant shore; but, slight though his motion, the carpenter's one eye\nsaw it and his none too nimble wit understood it.\n\n\"Nay,\" said he, \"it is a mad conceit.\"\n\nThe carpenter thrust his fingers through his beard, and, being a kindly\nsoul in his own way and having a liking for the boatswain, he wished\nhimself rid of his responsibilities. But since there was no escape from\nthe situation he drew a deep breath and squared his shoulders to make\nthe best of it. \"I heard of a man once, when I was a little lad,\" he\nsaid, \"who was cast ashore on the main, in Mexico or some such place.\nMiles Philips was his name and the manner of his suffering at the hands\nof the Indians and the Spaniards may serve as a warning. For they flung\nhim into prison where he was like to have starved; and they tortured\nhim in the Inquisition where he was like to have perished miserably;\nand many of his companions they beat and killed or sent to the galleys;\nand himself and certain others they sold for slaves. So grievous was\nhis suffering, he was nigh death when he heard news of Sir Francis\nDrake being in those seas and ran away to join him. Yet again they\ncaught him--caught this Miles Philips and clapped him into prison with\na great pair of bolts on his legs; and yet once more did he escape, for\nGod willed it, and filed off his irons and got him away and so betook\nhim back to England after such further suffering from the Indians and\nthe mosquitoes and the Spaniards and the dogs of the Inquisition as few\nmen have lived to tell the tale of. All this, I have heard from an old\nman who knew him, is told in Master Hakluyt's book, where any scholar\nof reading may find it for himself. Though not a man of reading, yet\nhave I taken it to heart to beware of straying from a ship into a\nstrange land.\"\n\nOf all the fellow had said Philip Marsham had heard no more than half,\nfor the cry that had twice sounded still rang in his ears, although\nsince it had died away the second time there was only silence on the\ndeck save for the carpenter's rambling talk. The lad's mind leaped\nnimbly from one occurrence to another in search for an explanation of\nthe cry.\n\n\"Tell me,\" said he, \"what happened on shore?\"\n\nAt this the carpenter laughed, pleased with believing he had got the\nboatswain's thoughts off the affair of the moment. \"Why, little enough.\nThey would have persuaded us to leave our weapons at the door, but the\nOld One was too wise a horse to be caught by the rattle of oats. And\nwhilst he was ducking and smiling and waving hands with the Spaniards,\nI myself, my ears being keen, heard one cry in Spanish, for I have a\nproper understanding of Spanish which I got by many pains and much\nlistening--as I was saying, I heard one cry in Spanish, 'Yea, that is\nhe.' And said I to myself, 'Now Heaven keep us! Where have I heard\nthat voice?' And then it came upon me and I cried in English, 'Who of\nus knew the dog, Will Canty, could talk Spanish?' Whereat the Old One,\nhearing me, turned and caught a glimpse of Will in the darkness. You\nknow his way--a shrewd blade, but hot-tempered. 'There,' cries he, 'is\nmy man! Seize him!' And with that I, being nearest, made a leap. And\nthey, being at the moment all oil to soothe our feelings and hood our\neyes, were off their guard. So the Old One, who likely enough had heard\nfor himself Will Canty's saying, since he too hath a curious knowledge\nof Spanish, cries, 'Back to the boat, my lads!' For seest thou, if Will\nCanty was pointing out this one or that, there was treacherous work in\nthe wind. So down through them we rushed, all together, bearing Will\nwith us by the suddenness and audacity of our act, and so away in a\nboat before they knew our thought.\"\n\n\"And who were the other Englishmen?\"\n\nThe carpenter gave the lad a blank look. \"Why, there were none.\"\n\nRising, Phil paced the deck while the carpenter and the others watched\nhim. Some scowled and whispered suspicions, and others denied them,\nuntil Phil himself heard one crying, \"Nay, nay, he's a true lad. 'Tis\nonly he hath a liking for the fellow.\"\n\nThe carpenter neither smiled nor frowned, for though he knew no\nloyalty deeper than his selfish interests, and though he felt no qualm\nregarding that which was going on in the cabin (since he had little\nlove for the poor wretch who was the victim), he had a very kindly\nfeeling toward those who got his liking; and it sorely troubled him\nthat Philip Marsham should suffer thus, though it were at second hand.\n\n\"Come, lad,\" said he, \"sit down here and take comfort in the fine\nnight.\"\n\nLaying his elbows on the rail, Phil thrust his hands through his hair\nand bit his two lips and stared at the distant shore of Cuba. He feared\nneither Indians nor insects nor the Inquisition. There were other\nthings, to his mind, more fearful than these.\n\nThe gasping sound that then came from the cabin was one thing more than\nhe could abide. He turned with the drawn dirk in his hand, but the\ncarpenter was on him from behind, whispering, \"Come, lad, come!\" And\nbecause he could not but be aware of the carpenter's honest good will,\nhe could not bring himself to use the dirk, yet only by using the dirk\ncould he have got out of the long arms that held him fast. For a moment\nthey swayed back and forth; then, when others were hurrying to aid the\ncarpenter, the door of the great cabin opened.\n\nA rumble of laughter issued, then the Old One's voice, \"Lay him here\nin the steerage and shackle him fast to the mizzen. He may well be\nthankful that I am a merciful man.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\nTOM JORDAN'S MERCY\n\n\nThey anchored that noon in a great bay surrounded by forests and\nmountains, which formed a harbour wherein a thousand sail of tall ships\nmight have lain. Through the long afternoon, while the Rose of Devon\nswung at her anchor, the wind stirred the palms and a wild stream,\nplunging in a succession of falls down a mountainside, shone like a\nsilver thread. But Paul Craig sat guard over Will Canty, who lay in the\nsteerage chained to the mizzenmast, and there was no chance for any\none of the men to speak with Will. And on deck the carpenter measured\nand sawed and planed for his purpose; and having shaped his stock he\nwrought a coffin.\n\nFirst he threw nails in a little heap on the deck, then, kneeling,\nhe drove them home into the planed boards. It was rap-rap-rap, and\nrap-rap-rap. The noise went through the ship, while the men looked at\none another; and some chuckled and said that the Old One was a rare\nbird; but the Old One, coming out of the great cabin without so much\nas a glance at the lad who lay chained to the mast, stood a long time\nbeside the carpenter. He kept a grave face while he watched him work,\nand very serious he looked when he turned away and came and stood\nbeside Philip Marsham.\n\n\"There are men that would slit the fellow's throat,\" he said, \"or burn\nhim at stake, or flay him alive; but I have a tender heart and am by\nnature merciful. Though he broke faith and dipped his hands in black\ntreachery, I bear him no ill will. I must needs twist his thumbs to\nwring his secrets out of him and I can no longer keep him about me;\nyet, as I have said, I bear him no ill will. Saw you ever a finer\ncoffin than the one I have ordered made for him?\"\n\nWhat could a man reply? Although there had been complaining and revolt\nbefore, the Old One again held the ship in the palm of his hand, for\nthey feared his irony more than his anger.\n\nDarkness came and they lowered the coffin into the boat, whither man\nafter man slid down.\n\n\"Come, boatswain,\" said the Old One, in a quiet, solemn voice. \"There\nis an oar to pull.\"\n\nAnd what could a man do but slide with the others down into the\nboat and rest on the loom of an oar? Phil shared a thwart with the\ncarpenter, and raised his oar and held it upright between his knees.\n\nThe coffin lay across the boat amidships, and there were four oars,\ntwo on the one side and two on the other; but a man sat beside each\noarsman, two more crowded into the bow, and two sat in the stern sheets\nwith the Old One. Then they lowered Will Canty to the bottom in front\nof the Old One, where he lay bound hand and foot.\n\nShoving off from the ship, the oarsmen bent to their task and the Old\nOne steered with a sweep; but the boat was crowded and deep in the\nwater, and they made slow progress.\n\nMosquitoes swarmed about them and droned interminably. The water licked\nat the boat and lapped on the white beach. The wind stirred in the\npalms. The great bay with its mountains and its starry sky was as fair\na piece of land and sea as a man might wish to look upon in his last\nhour; but there are few men whose philosophy will stand by them at such\na moment, and there is an odd quirk in human nature whereby a mere\ndroning mosquito can drive out of mind the beauty of sea and land--nay,\neven thoughts of an immeasurable universe.\n\nThe men beat at mosquitoes and swore wickedly until the Old One bade\nthem be silent and row on, for although they had come near the shore\nthe water was still deep under the boat, which tossed gently in the\nstarlight.\n\nA time followed in which the only sounds were of the wind and the\nwaves and the heavy breathing of the men. Some were turning their\nheads to see the shore and the Old One had already risen to choose a\nlanding-place, when Will Canty--who, although bound hand and foot, had\nall the while been edging about in the stern unknown to the others till\nhe had braced his feet in such a way that he could get purchase for a\nleap--gave a great spring from where he lay, and thus threw himself up\nand fell with his back across the gunwale, whence, wriggling like a\nworm, he strove to push himself over the side.\n\nThe Old One sprang forward in fury to seize and hold him, and caught\nhim by the wrist; but one of the men in zeal to have a hand in the\naffair drove the butt of his gun against Will Canty's chin, and in\nrecovering the piece he stumbled and pushed the Old One off his\nbalance. So the Old One lost his hold on Will Canty's wrist and before\nthe rest knew what was happening Will had slipped into the deep water\nand had sunk. That he never rose was doubtless the best fortune that\ncould have befallen him, and likely enough it was the blow of the gun\nthat killed him. But the Old One was roused to such a pitch of wrath at\nbeing balked of his revenge that he was like a wild beast in his fury.\n\nQuicker than thought, he turned on the man who had pushed against him,\nand reaching for the coffin that was made to Will's measure--a great,\nheavy box it was!--raised it high and flung it at the fellow.\n\nIt gashed the man's forehead and fell over the side and floated away,\nand the man himself, with a string of oaths, clapped his hand to the\nwound, whence the blood trickled out between his fingers.\n\n\"Swine! Ass!\" the Old One snarled. \"I was of a mind to lay thee in Will\nCanty's bed. But let the coffin go. Th' art not worthy of it.\" The boat\ngrated on white sand, and leaping to his feet the Old One cried with a\nhigh laugh as he marked his victim's fear, \"Get thee gone! If ever I\nsee thy face again, I will slit thy throat from ear to ear.\"\n\n\"Nay, nay, do not send me away! Do not send me away!\" the man wailed.\n\"O God! No, not that! I shall perish of Indians and Spaniards! The wild\nbeasts will devour me. Nay! Nay!\"\n\nThe Old One smiled and reached for a musket, and the poor fellow, his\nface streaked with gore, was overcome by the greater terror and fled\naway under the palms. No shot was fired and neither knife nor sword was\ndrawn ere the echo of the fellow's wailing died into silence; but the\nOld One then fired a single shot after him, which evoked a last scream.\n\n\"Come, Martin, take the scoundrel's oar,\" quoth the Old One, and he\nturned the head of the boat to sea.\n\nThey said little and were glad to row briskly out to the ship. Action\nis ever welcome at the time when a man desires most of all to get away\nfrom memory and thought.\n\nThat night, when they were all asleep, Martin leaped out on the deck\nand woke them by shrieking like a lunatic, until it seemed they were\nall transported into Bedlam. He then himself awoke, but he would say\nonly, \"My God, what a dream! Oh, what a dream!\" And he would rub his\nhands across his eyes.\n\nThe grumblers continued quietly to grumble, for that is a joy no\npower on earth can take away, but there was no more talk of another\ncaptain. Some said that now the luck would change and told of prizes\nthey had taken and would take, and recalled to mind the strong liquors\nof Bideford and the pasties that Mother Taylor would make for them.\nOthers, although they said little, shook their heads and appeared to\nwish themselves far away. But whether a man felt thus or otherwise,\nthere was small profit of their talking.\n\nFor another day and night they lay at anchor and ate and drank and\nsprawled out in the sun. The Rose of Devon, as they had earlier had\noccasion to remark, was richly found, and they had still no need to\nbestir themselves for food and drink. But any man with a head on his\nshoulders must perceive that with old Jacob, who had gone so wisely\nabout his duties and had so well held his own counsel in many things,\nthe ship had lost something of stability and firm purpose even in her\nlawless pursuits.\n\nAnd Will Canty, too, was gone! As the old writer has it, \"One is choked\nwith a fly, another with a hair, a third pushing his foot against the\ntrestle, another against the threshold, falls down dead: So many kind\nof ways are chalked out for man, to draw towards his last home, and\nwean him from the love of earth.\" Though Will Canty had died a hard\ndeath, he had escaped worse; and as Priam, numbering more days than\nTroilus, shed more tears, so Philip Marsham, outliving his friend,\nfaced such times as the other was spared knowing.\n\nOf all this he thought at length, and fearing his own conscience more\nthan all the familiars of the Inquisition, in which he was singularly\nheartened by remembering the stout old knight in the scarlet cloak, he\ncontrived a plan and bode his time.\n\nIn the darkness of the second night, when the Old One had somewhat\nrelaxed his watchfulness, Boatswain Marsham slipped over the bow and\nlowered himself silently on a rope he had procured for the purpose,\nand very carefully, lest the noise be heard on board the ship, seated\nhimself in Tom Jordan's boat and rowed for shore. An honest man can go\nso far in a company of rogues and no farther.\n\nReaching the land and hauling the boat up on the beach in plain sight\nof those left in the Rose of Devon, where they might swim for it if\nthey would, he set off across the hills and under the palms. Upon\nreaching the height he looked back and for a moment watched the old\nship as she swung with the tide on the still, clear water. He hoped he\nshould never see her again. Then he looked down at the tremulous and\nshimmering bay where Will Canty lay dead, and was glad to plunge over\nthe hill and leave the bay behind him.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX\n\nA MAN SEEN BEFORE\n\n\nThere was sullen anger and worse in the Rose of Devon when day broke,\nfor the boatswain, too, had gone and the boat lay in sight upon the\nbeach whereby all might know the means of his going.\n\nOne watching from the mountain would have seen the Rose of Devon spread\nher sails and put to sea like a great bird with white wings. But there\nwas no one on the mountain to watch, and when the ship had sailed,\nno human being remained to interrupt the placid calm that overspread\nthe bay that summer morning. The sun blazed from a clear sky, and the\ngreen palms rustled and swayed beside the blue water, and in all the\nmarvelously fair prospect of land and sea no sign or mark of violence\nremained.\n\nPhil Marsham had gone in the night over the hills and across the narrow\npeninsula between two bays. Though the way was rough, the land was high\nand--for the tropics--open, and he had put the peninsula behind him by\nsunrise. He had then plunged down into a swampy region, but, finding\nthe tangle of vines and canes well nigh impassable in the dark, he had\nstruggled round it and had again come to the shore.\n\nThere, finding once more a place where a man could walk easily, he had\npressed on at dawn through a forest of tall trees in infinite number\nand variety, with flowers and fruits in abundance, and past a plain of\nhigh grass of wonderful greenness.\n\nA short time after sunrise he drank from a spring of water and ate\nship's bread from the small store with which he had provided himself.\nBut he dared not linger, and resuming his journey he came upon two huts\nwhere nets and fishing-tackle were spread in the sun to dry. The heat,\nwhich seemed to swell from the very earth, by then so sorely oppressed\nhim that he stopped for a while in a shady place to rest. But still he\ndared not stay, and although upon again arising he saw that dark clouds\nwere covering the sky, he once more stepped forth with such a stout\nheart as had carried him out of London and all the long way to Bideford\nin Devon.\n\nIt gave him a queer feeling to be tramping through an unknown land with\nno destination in his mind, yet he vowed to himself that, come what\nmight, he would never go back to the Rose of Devon. There is a time\nwhen patience and forbearance are enough to earn a man a hempen halter,\nand thinking thus, he faced the storm and renewed his determination.\n\nThe wind rose to a furious gale; the clouds overswept the sky and\nthunder shook the earth and heavens. The rain, sweeping down in\nslanting lines, cut through the palm leaves like hundreds upon hundreds\nof thrusting swords; and lightning flamed and flashed, and leaped from\nhorizon to horizon, and hung in a sort of continual cloud of deathly\nblue in the zenith, blazing and quivering with appalling reverberations\nthat went booming off through the mountains and came rolling back in\nponderous echoes. It was enough to make a brave man think the black\nangels were marshalling for the last great battle; it was such a\nstorm as a boy born in England and taught his seamanship in northern\nwaters knew only by sailors' tales. The rain beat through the poor\nshelter that he found and drenched him to the skin, and the roaring and\nthundering of the tempest filled him with awe. And when the storm had\npassed, for it lasted not above three quarters of an hour, the sun came\nout again and filled the air with a steamy warmth that was oppressive\nbeyond description.\n\nThen the woods came to life and insects stirred and droned, and\nmosquitoes, issuing from among the leaves and grasses, plagued him to\nthe verge of madness.\n\nOne who has lived always in a land where mosquitoes return each year in\nsummer is likely to have no conception of the venomous strength with\nwhich their poison can work upon one who has not, by much experience of\ntheir bites, built up a measure of resistance against it. Phil's hands\nswelled until he could not shut them, and the swelling of his face so\nnearly closed his eyes that he could hardly see. When two hours later,\nall but blinded, and thirsting and hungry, he came again to the shore\nand made out in the offing, by squinting between swollen eyelids, the\nsame Rose of Devon from which he had run away and to which he had vowed\nhe would never return, his misery was such that he would have been glad\nenough to be on board her and away from such torment, though they ended\nthe day by hanging him. But the Rose of Devon sailed away over the blue\nsea on which the sun shone as calmly and steadily as if there had been\nno tempest, and Philip Marsham sat down on a rock and gave himself up\nas a man already dead.\n\nThere two natives of the country found him, and by grace of God, who\ntempered their hearts with mercy, carried him to their poor hut and\ntended him with their simple remedies until he was in such measure\nrecovered of the poison that he could see as well as ever. He then set\nout once more upon his way to he knew not where, having rubbed himself\nwith an ointment of vile odour, which they gave him in goodly quantity\nto keep off all pestiferous insects, and on the day when he ate the\nlast morsel of the food with which the natives had provided him he saw\nfrom the side of a high hill a strange ship at anchor in a cove beneath.\n\nNow a ship might mean one thing or she might mean another; and a man's\nlife might depend on the difference.\n\nDrinking deeply from a stream that ran over the rocks and through the\nforest, and so at last into the cove, Philip Marsham returned into the\nwood and sat upon a fallen tree. He saw a boat put out from the ship\nand touch on the shore a long way off, where some men left her and\nwent out of sight. After an hour or two they came back, and, entering\nthe boat, returned to the ship. He saw men working on deck and in the\nrigging; he heard the piping of a whistle, and now and again, as the\nwind changed, he heard more faintly than the drone of insects the\nvoices of the men.\n\nBeing high above the shore, he found the mosquitoes fewer and the wind\nhelped drive them away; yet they plagued him continually, despite his\nointment, of which little was left, and made him miserable while he\nstayed. He would have hurried off had he dared; but the chance that the\nship would be the means of saving his life withheld him from pursuing\nhis journey, while doubt concerning the manner of craft she was\nwithheld him from making known his presence.\n\nIn mid-afternoon he saw far away a sail, which came slowly in across\nthe blue plain of the sea; and having clear eyes, trained by long\npractice, he descried even at that great distance the motion of a\nheavily rolling ship. From his seat high on the hill he could see a\nlong way farther than the men in the ship in the cove, and a point of\nland shut off from them an arc of the sea that was visible from the\nhill; so when night fell they were still unaware of the sail.\n\nThough he had watched for hours the ship in the cove, the runaway\nboatswain of the Rose of Devon had discovered no sign of what nation\nhad sent her out or what trade her men followed; but there came a time\nwhen his patience could endure suspense no longer. He picked his way\ndown to the shore, following the stream from which he had been drinking\nduring his long watch, and cautiously moved along the edge of the water\ntill he came to the point of land nearest the anchored ship, whence he\ncould very plainly hear voices on board her. There were lights on the\nstern and on deck, and through an open port he got sight of hammocks\nswinging above the guns on the main deck.\n\nAt last he took off the greater part of his clothes and piled them\non a rock; then, strapping his dirk to his waist, he waded silently\ninto the water. Reaching his depth, he momentarily hesitated, but\nfortifying his resolution with such philosophy as he could muster, he\nbegan deliberately and silently to swim. Letting himself lie deep in\nthe water and moving so slowly that he raised no wake, he came into the\nshadow of the ship. It was good to feel her rough planking. He swam\naft under the quarter, and coming to the rudder laid hands on it and\nrested. Above him he could see, upon looking up, a lighted cabin-window.\n\nHis own body seemed ponderous as he slowly lifted himself out of\nwater. He raised one hand from the tip of the rudder just above the\ntiller to the carving overhead and got grip on a scroll wrought in\ntough oak. He put his foot on the rudder, and feeling above him with\nhis other hand seized fast the leg of a carved dragon. Very thankful\nfor the brave ornaments with which the builder had bedecked the ship,\nhe next got hold of the dragon's snout, and clinging like a fly, unseen\nand unsuspected, above the black water that gurgled about the rudder\nand the hull, he crawled silently up the stern.\n\nComing thus to the lighted cabin window, he peeked in and found the\nplace deserted. On the table a cloth was laid, and on the cloth such a\ndinner service as he could scarce have dreamed of. There were glasses\nof rare tints, with a few drops of wine left in them, which glowed\nlike garnets under the bright candles. There were goblets of silver,\nand even, he believed, of gold. There were wonderfully delicate plates\ncrusted with gold about the edges. There was an abundance of silver to\neat with and a great decanter, wrought about with gold and precious\nstones, such as simple folk might not expect to see this side of Heaven.\n\nAt the sound of steps, Phil drew back and hung over the water on the\ngreat stern of the ship.\n\nA boy came into the cabin and stepped briskly about clearing the table.\nVoices came down from above--and they were speaking in English! What\na prize she would have made for the Rose of Devon, Phil thought, and\ngrimly smiled.\n\n\"Boy!\" a voice bellowed from somewhere in the bowels of the ship.\n\n\"Yea, yea, master,\" cried the boy, and with that he scurried from the\ncabin like a startled chick.\n\nPhil raised his head and renewed his hold, for he could not cling there\nforever; yet how to introduce himself on board the ship was a question\nthat sorely puzzled him. He threw a bare leg over the sill, the more\neasily to rest, and revolved the problem in his mind. They were plainly\nhonest Englishmen, and right glad would he have been to get himself in\namong them. Yet if he came like a thief in the night, they must suspect\nhim of evil intentions without end. While he thus attacked the problem\nfrom one side and from the other, it occurred to him that the best way\nwas to crawl down again into the water and swim back to the shore from\nwhence he had come. There, having donned his clothes, he would call for\nhelp. Surely there was no one so hard of heart as to refuse a lad help\nin escaping from the pirates.\n\nHe raised his leg to swing it out of the window again and put his\nscheme into practice, when he felt--and it startled him nearly out of\nhis skin--a hand lay hold on his ankle.\n\nIf you will balance yourself on the outside of any window with one foot\nover the sill, you will find it exceedingly difficult to pull your foot\naway from some one inside the window without throwing yourself off the\nwall, and Phil for the moment was reluctant to make the plunge. Slowly\nat first he twisted and pulled, but to no purpose. With waxing vigour\nhe struggled and yanked and kicked and jerked, but completely failed to\nget his ankle out of the hand that held it.\n\nIt seemed that a gentleman who had been sitting at a little desk, so\nplaced that Phil could not have seen it without thrusting his head all\nthe way into the cabin, had looked up, and, perceiving to his mild\nsurprise a naked foot thrust in through the window, had nimbly arisen,\nand stepping lightly toward the foot, had seized the ankle firmly at\nthe moment when Phil was about to withdraw it.\n\nThe gentleman marvelled much at what he had discovered and purposed to\nget at the reason for it. Not only did he succeed with ease in holding\nthe ankle fast against his captive's somewhat cautious first kicks;\nhe anticipated a more desperate effort by getting firm hold with both\nhands, so that when his captive decided to risk all, so to speak, and\ntried with might and main to fling himself free and into the water by\na great leap, the gentleman kept fast his hold and held the lad by his\none leg, who dangled below like a trapped monkey.\n\nVery likely it was foolish of Philip Marsham to attempt escaping,\nbut as I have said he was of no mind to be caught thus like a thief\nentering in the night, and he was so completely surprised that he had\nno time at all to collect his wits before he acted. Yet caught he was,\nand, for a bad bargain, hung by the heels to boot.\n\n\"Boy,\" the gentleman said, and his voice indicated that he had a droll\nhumour, \"call Captain Winterton.\"\n\nThe boy, further sounds revealed, who had come silently and in leisure,\ndeparted noisily and in haste.\n\nHeavy steps then approached, and a gruff voice cried, \"What devilish\nsort of game is this?\"\n\n\"Take his other leg, Charles, and we shall soon have him safe on board.\nI am not yet prepared to say what sort of game it is, beyond saying\nthat it is a rare and curious game.\"\n\nThereupon a second pair of hands closed on Philip Marsham's other\nankle, and, would he or would he not, he was hauled speedily through\nthe cabin window.\n\n\"Young man,\" said the gentleman who had first seized him, \"who and what\nare you, and from whence have you come?\"\n\n\"I am Philip Marsham, late boatswain of the Rose of Devon frigate. I\ncame to learn from what country this ship had sailed and to ask for\nhelp. I myself sailed from Bideford long since in the Rose of Devon,\nbut, falling into the hands of certain sailors of fortune who killed\nour master and took our ship, I have served them for weary months as a\nforced man. Having at last succeeded in running away from them, I have\ncome hither by land, as you can see, suffering much on the way, and I\nask you now to have compassion on me, in God's name, and take me home\nto England.\"\n\n\"Truly,\" said the gentleman, \"those devilish flies have wrought their\nworst upon him. His face is swelled till it is as thick-lipped as a\nGuinea slave's.\" He spoke lightly and with little thought of Phil's\nwords, for his humour was uppermost in him. He was in every way the\nfine gentleman with an eye for the comical, accustomed to having all\nthings done for him and as little likely to feel pity for this nearly\nnaked youth as to think it wrong that the little cabin boy should stand\ntill morning behind his chair, lest by chance, desiring one thing or\nanother, he must compromise his dignity by fetching it for himself.\n\nBut now the other, Captain Winterton, a tall, grave man, with cold face\nand hard cold eyes, stepped forward, and speaking for the first time\nsaid: \"Do you remember me?\"\n\nPhil looked him in the eye and felt his heart sink, but he was no\ncoward. \"I do,\" he replied.\n\nCaptain Winterton smiled. He was the first of the three men who had\ncome on board the Rose of Devon by way of her gallery, and had entered\nthe great cabin the night when Phil Marsham sat there at supper.\n\nIt then burst upon Phil that in the whole plain truth lay his only hope.\n\n\"I ran away from them--they had forced me into their service!--a week\nsince. Nay, it is true! I am no liar! And it will pay you well to keep\na sharp watch this night, for a vessel like enough to the Rose of Devon\nto be her twin is this minute lying behind yonder point.\"\n\n\"Ah! And you sailed, I believe you said, from Bideford. Doubtless you\nhave kept the day in mind?\"\n\n\"Why, 'twas in early May. Or--stay! 'Twas--\"\n\n\"Enough! Enough! The master of--\"\n\n\"But though I marked neither the day of the week nor the day of the\nmonth, I remember the sailing well.\"\n\n\"Doubtless,\" quoth the captain dryly, \"but it will save time and serve\nthy cause to speak only when I bid thee. Interrupt me not, but tell me\nnext the name of the lawful master in whose charge thy most excellent\nship sailed from Bideford.\"\n\nThis keen and quiet captain in the King's service was of no mind that\nhis prisoner should tell with impunity such a story as he might make\nup on the moment. Accordingly he proceeded to draw forth by question\nafter question such particular parts of the story as he himself desired\nto hear, now attacking the matter from one angle and now from another,\nwatching his prisoner closely the while and all the time standing in\nsuch a place that the lad had no chance at all of escaping through the\nopen window.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX\n\nA PRIZE FOR THE TAKING\n\n\n\"We shall see,\" said Captain Winterton, when he had listened to all\nof the tale that he would hear. He turned about. \"Boy,\" he cried, \"go\nspeedily and send Mr. Rance in to me.\"\n\nThe boy departed in haste and in a moment there entered a junior\nofficer, who stared in frank curiosity at the three in the cabin.\n\n\"Mr. Rance,\" said the captain, \"go aloft in person to the main truck\nand look about you sharply. Come back and report what you see.\"\n\n\"Yea, yea, sir,\" the young man replied, and with that he was gone.\n\nThe captain stood by the cabin window and frowned. Plainly he had small\nconfidence in the good faith of the prisoner and regarded his story as\nat best an attempt to save himself at the expense of his friends. The\ngentleman of the humours, somewhat sobered by the captain's manner of\ngrave concern, returned to his desk, but sat tapping his fingers and\nwatching Philip Marsham.\n\nIt had instantly, of course, dawned upon the runaway boatswain that\nhis peril was more serious than he had had reason earlier to believe.\nFor supposing the unknown sail should in all truth be the Rose of\nDevon,--and since she was cruising idly thereabouts nothing was more\nprobable,--he stood between the Devil, or at all events the Devil's\nown emissary, Thomas Jordan, and a deeper sea than any ship has ever\nsailed: the sea upon which many a man with less plain evidence of\npiracy against him has embarked from a yardarm with a hempen collar\nabout his neck and a black cap over his eyes.\n\nWho, pray, would accept for sober truth such a tale as any scoundrel\nwould make out of whole cloth to save himself from hanging? Despite all\nhe could do or say, he now saw plainly, he must stand convicted, in\ntheir minds, of being at the very least a spy sent to learn the state\nof affairs on board this tall ship in which he was now a prisoner.\n\nThen back to the cabin came young Mr. Rance and very much excited did\nhe appear.\n\n\"Sir,\" he exclaimed, and stood in the door.\n\n\"Tell your tale.\"\n\n\"A ship lieth two cable's lengths from land on the farther side of the\npoint, and a boat hath set out from her and is following the shore as\nif to reconnoitre.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" said the captain, \"it is quite as I thought. No drums, mind you,\nnor trumpets, Mr. Rance. Call the men to quarters by word of mouth.\nMake haste and put springs on the cables if there be time before the\nboat rounds the point. Bid the gunner make all preparations for action\nand order a sharp watch kept; but order also that there be no sound or\nappearance of unusual activity. Send me a corporal and a file of men,\nand the master.\"\n\nThe gentleman at the desk chuckled.\n\n\"Come, boy, clear the table,\" said the captain.\n\nThe boy jumped and returned to his work.\n\nThe master came first, but the corporal and his men were close at the\nmaster's heels.\n\n\"Take this fellow to the gun room, clap him into irons, and set a man\nto watch him.\"\n\n\"Yea, yea. Come, fellow, march along.\"\n\nAnd thus sending before them Boatswain Marsham, erstwhile of the Rose\nof Devon frigate, the corporal and his men departed from the cabin.\n\nThere were guns on the right hand and the left--ordnance of a size to\nsink the Rose of Devon with a broadside. There were sailormen thronging\nbetween-decks in numbers to appall the young prisoner who came down\namong them nearly naked from his swim. Though no greater of burthen\nthan the Rose of Devon, the ship was better armed and better manned,\nand all signs told of the stern discipline of a man-of-war.\n\nThe alternatives that Phil Marsham faced, as he sat in shackles with no\nspirit to reply to the jibes of the sailors and watched men stripped to\nthe waist and moving deftly among the guns, were not those a man would\nchoose. If his old shipmates took this tall and handsome ship, a blow\non the head and a burial over the side was the kindest treatment he\ncould expect of them. And if not--the gallows loomed beyond a Court of\nAdmiralty. For hours the hum of voices went up and down the main deck\nand for hours Boatswain Marsham sat with the bolts upon his legs and\nwrists and saw the life of the ship go on around him. The men leaped\nhere and there at a word, or lolled by their guns waiting for orders.\nThe night wore on, and nodding, Phil thought of the two ships lying\none on each side of the point of land and by all appearances two quiet\nmerchantmen. Yet one, he knew to his sorrow, smelled devilishly of\nbrimstone; and the other, in which he now sat a prisoner, though her\nports were closed and her claws sheathed, was like some great tiger\nwatching through half-shut eyes a bold, adventurous goat.\n\nAs the night wore on, he dared hope that the reconnoitering boat had\nreturned to her ship with news that had sent her away in haste, whereby\nthere was a chance that his tale might yet be taken for the truth that\nit was; and the longer he waited the higher rose his hope, and with\nthe better reason. But an hour or more after midnight he heard men\nbeginning to talk as if there was something new in the wind, and the\nnearest gunner put his ear to a cat-hole.\n\n\"The dogs are out; I hear oars,\" he whispered. \"Yea, though they are\nrowing softly, I swear I can hear oars.\"\n\nA hush came over the ship and those below heard faintly a hail given on\ndeck.\n\nDistant sounds came and went like whispers out of the sky, then\nsomewhere outside the ship a great shouting arose and one of the men at\na starboard gun cried gleefully, with a round oath, \"Verily they are\nbent on boarding us, lads! Their foolish audacity seasons the term of\nall our weary waiting.\"\n\n\"Hark! They are hailing!\" cried another.\n\n\"Come, strike your flag. Have an end of all this talk,\" a distant voice\ncalled. Whereat Philip Marsham, who knew the voice, thought that though\ntheir audacity cost him his life it was in its own mad way superb.\n\nThe reply was inaudible below, but a boat crashed against the ship.\n\nThere was a burst of yelling, followed by a rattle of musketry, then a\nvoice boomed down, \"Haul up your ports and run out your guns!\"\n\nAt that the men beside the guns sprang up with running and calling and\nthe ports flew open and the sounds from without became suddenly louder\nand clearer. On the one hand were boys handing up filled budge-barrels;\non the other were gunners with linstocks ready and powder for the\npriming. Then, \"Ho, Master Gunner,\" a great voice roared, \"withhold\nyour fire! The boats are under the guns and too near for a fair shot!\"\nIt was such a moment as a man remembers always, for there was the smoke\nof powder in the air, with a din of splashing and cursing, and overhead\na great hubbub, then silence save for the quick beat of oars.\n\n\"See! See!\" cried the men. \"There go their boats, splintered and all\nbut sunk! And see! There go ours! To your oars, lads, to your oars, ere\ntheir ship hath time to flee! See! There they go! Yea, and there go we!\"\n\nThe Old One had made his last blunder. He had come by night, thinking\nto board a peaceful merchantman laden with a rich cargo, and had found\nhimself at the head of his score of men on the deck of a man-of-war.\n\nTo all those below, but most of all to Philip Marsham chained in the\ngun room, it was a blind, confusing affair; but the sounds told the\nstory; and though darkness hid the blood that was spilled, there was no\nmistaking the cries for quarter and the shrieks of agony.\n\nNor was there need for haste to reach the Rose of Devon, since the\nmen left as keepers of the ship were too few to make sail. Captain\nCharles Winterton of the King's navy himself boarded the dark frigate\nby starlight, and a capital lark he found it, for behind his stern mien\nwas a lively taste for such adventure. With lusty shouting he swept\nthe handful of men from her deck, and having put a prize crew and his\nlieutenant in charge of her, he brought back a few more prisoners to\njoin company with the luckless boarders he had sent down to be locked\nin irons below.\n\nThey were sad and angry gentlemen, for there are those to whom the\nlaughter of a hundred sailors is worse than death by the sword. The\nfirst of them all to enter the gun room was Tom Jordan. His cheek\nwas gashed and his hair was singed and blood smeared his shirt from\nshoulder to shoulder and one arm hung limp and broken; but though he\nwas in great pain he smiled, and when they led him into the gun room\nand he saw Philip Marsham with bolts on wrists and ankles, he laughed\naloud.\n\nThe fellow was a very mark and pattern of a scoundrel, but he had\nthe courage and spirit of a hero, and had he first gone to sea under\nanother king than James or Charles he might in some overwhelming danger\nhave saved England. Great admirals are made of such timber--bold,\nresolute, utterly dauntless--and any bold man might have fallen into\nthe same trap that had caught Tom Jordan. (Nay, had nothing warned\nCaptain Winterton or aroused his suspicions, there was a fighting\nchance for Tom Jordan to have taken his ship from him even so.) But\nTom Jordan had gone to sea in the days when the navy was going to the\ndogs, and, like many another lad of spirit who left the King's service\nto join the pirates, he had adventured with the Algerians before he led\nthe gentlemen of Bideford. And at last, hazarding a final effort to\nretrieve his luck, he had unwittingly thrust his head into the halter.\n\nYet, though they had broken his body, they had failed to touch his\ncourage; despite his pain, he could smile and even laugh. Turning his\ngreat grief into a jest, he cried, \"Holla, O bravest of boatswains!\nThis is a joy I had not looked for. It seems that, if hang I must, I\nshall not hang alone.\" And laughing again, right merrily, he swooned\naway, which Captain Charles Winterton, having himself come down with\nthe others to see them all shackled, watched with quiet interest.\n\nThey brought down the carpenter, who was shaking like a man with an\nague, and his beard waggled as he shook. They brought down Martin\nBarwick, whose face was drawn and haggard, and his hand rubbed his\nthroat, for it itched in a prophetic manner. Then came Harry Malcolm,\nwho stopped before Phil and spat at him and cursed him, and Paul Craig,\nwho had neither eye nor thought for any one besides himself, and a\ndozen others of whom there was not one that failed to revile at their\nerstwhile boatswain. A hapless time of it Philip Marsham had among\nthem, but it added little to his great burden of misery.\n\nNor, for the matter of that, did reviling content them; for toward\nmorning, when the others were dozing, Harry Malcolm, whom they had\nlocked to a longer chain, crawled over to where Phil lay and very\ncraftily tried to kill him with bare hands. The guard cried out, but\ninstead of stopping, the man redoubled his efforts to throttle the lad\nwhom he had seized from behind when he was asleep; whereupon the guard\nstruck a sharp blow with the butt of his musket, and when the corporal\nhad come running and had felt of Harry Malcolm's wrist and had listened\nfor his heart and had turned him over on his back, he cursed the guard\nwith fluent oaths for robbing the gallows.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI\n\nILL WORDS COME TRUE\n\n\nTo the Isle of Wight, and thence to Spithead and Deptford, came in\ntime the Sybil of forty-four guns, Captain Charles Winterton, and\naccompanying her, in the hands of a prize crew, the Rose of Devon\nfrigate. There, bundling certain unhappy gentlemen of fortune out of\nthe ship, they sent them expeditiously up to London and deposited them\nfor safe keeping in the Marshalsea prison, a notable hostelry which has\nharboured great rogues before and since.\n\nIn the fullness of time, the Lord High Admiral of England, \"who holds\nhis court of justice for trials of all sea causes for life and goods,\"\nbeing assisted by the Judge of Admiralty and sundry others, officers\nand advocates and proctors and civilians, was moved to proceed against\nthe aforesaid gentlemen of fortune. So they heard their names cried in\nthe High Court of Admiralty and were arraigned for piracy and robbery\non the high seas and charged with seizing the frigate Rose of Devon,\nthe property of Thomas Ball and others, and murdering her master,\nFrancis Candle, and stealing supplies and equipment to the value of\neight hundred pounds. Nor was that the whole tale of charges, for it\nseemed that the Lords of Admiralty laid to the discredit of those\nparticular gentlemen of fortune numerous earlier misdeeds of great\ndaring and wickedness and an attempt to take His Majesty's ship Sybil,\nwhich had cost the lives of certain of His Majesty's seamen and had\noccasioned His Majesty much grief and concern.\n\nHe who read the indictment spoke in a loud and solemn voice, such as\nmight of itself make a man think of his sins and fear judgment; but\nthey were already cowed and fearful, save only the Old One, who still\nheld his head high and very scornfully smiled. The cook bent his head\nand shivered and dared not look the jury in the face. The carpenter\nwept and Martin Barwick was like a man struck dumb and Paul Craig kept\nworking his mouth and biting at his lips.\n\nThere was a great concourse of people, for who would not seize upon\nthe chance to see a band of pirates? But a very poor show the pirates\nmade, save the Old One; for though they had talked much and often of\ntheir valour and had represented themselves as tall fellows who feared\nnothing in life or death, they were now and for all time revealed as\ncowards to the marrow of their bones.\n\nQuietly and expeditiously the officers of the Court swore their first\nwitness, who smelled of pitch and tar and bore himself in such wise\nthat he was to be known for a sailor wherever he might turn.\n\nTo their questions he replied with easy assurance, for he was not one\nof those fellows who cope with great gales and storms at sea only to be\ncowed by a great person on land. \"Yea, sir,\" quoth he, \"there is among\nmariners common talk of a band of sea sharks that hath long resorted\nto His Majesty's port of Bideford. Yea, my lord.--And have I met with\nthem? That I have, and to my sorrow. This month two years I was master\nin a likely snow, the Prosperous of three hundred tons, which fell\nafoul of that very company, as their boasting and talk discovered\nto us, who took our ship and set me adrift in a boat with seven of\nmine own men, whereby, God being merciful unto us, we succeeded after\nmany hardships in winning to the shore of Ireland, whence the Grace\nof Bristol bore us home to England.--The fate of the others in our\ncompany? In faith, some, I am told, joined themselves with that same\nband of sea sharks. The rest were slaughtered out of hand.--Nay, my\nlord, the night was black and my sight of the scoundrels was brief. I\nmuch misdoubt if I should know them again.\"\n\n\"Come, come,\" quoth His Lordship, tapping the papers spread on his\ngreat table, \"look at these prisoners gathered here at the bar and tell\nme if there be one among them of whom you can say, 'This man was there;\nthis man did thus and so.'\"\n\nSo the witness came, with the air of a man who is pleased to be seen\nof many people, and looked them over, one and all; but at the end of\nhis looking he sadly shook his head. \"Nay, my lord, the night was dark\nand sight was uncertain; and though I should rejoice--none more than\nI!--to see a pirate hanged, I am most loath to swear away the life of\nan innocent man. There is no man here of whom I can truly say I have\nseen him before.\"\n\nHis Lordship frowned and the proctors shook their heads; the prisoners\nsighed and breathed more freely. The tale was at an end, and bearing\naway with him his smell of pitch and tar the fellow returned to his\nplace.\n\nFour witnesses were then summoned, one after another, and told tales\nlike the first. One had been in a ship that was seized and sunk in\nBristol Channel; the second had received a gaping wound in the shoulder\noff St. David's Head, and had known no more until he found himself\nalone on the deck of a plundered flyboat; the third had fallen into\nevil company in Plymouth, which beat him and robbed him and left him\nfor dead, and from the talk of his murderous companions he had learned,\nbefore they set upon him that they were certain gentry of Bideford;\nand the last of the four told of the murderous attack of a boarding\nparty, which had taken a brig and tumbled him over the side into a\nboat. \"Yea, my lord,\" he cried, \"and I fear to think upon what befell\nour captain's little son, for of all our crew only three men were left\nalive and as they sailed away from us three we heard the boy shrieking\npitifully.\" One by one the witnesses wove with their tales a black\nnet of wickedness, but they could not or would not say they knew this\nprisoner or that.\n\nThe Judge frowned darkly from his bench and the people in the seats\nopened their mouths in wonder and excitement at the stories of robbery\nand murder. But the net was woven loosely and without knots, for thus\nfar there had been no one to pick out this man or that and say, \"It\nwas he who did it.\" So the cook and the carpenter took heart; and the\ncolour returned to Martin Barwick's face; and the Old One, leaning\nback, still smiled scornfully. Yet the Judge and the advocates seemed\nin no way discouraged, from which the men of the Rose of Devon might\nhave drawn certain conclusions; for as all the world knows, judges and\nadvocates with a band of pirates under the thumb are, for the honour of\nthe law, set upon making an example of them.\n\nThere was long counselling in whispers, then a bustle and stir, and an\nofficer cried loudly, \"Come, make haste and lead her in.\"\n\nA murmur passed over the court and the people turned their heads to\nlook for the meaning of the cry. Then a door opened and an officer\nappeared, leading by the arm a very old woman.\n\nPhil Marsham felt his heart leap up; he saw Martin raise his hand to\nhis throat with a look of horror. But when he stole a glance at the\nOld One, he saw, to his wonder, that the Old One was smiling as calmly\nas before: truly the man was a marvel of unconcern and a very cool and\ndesperate rascal.\n\n\"Is this the woman?\" quoth my Lord the Judge, who raised his head and\nlifted his brows to see her the better.\n\n\"Yea, my lord.\"\n\n\"Hm! Let us look into this matter!\" There was silence in the room\nexcept for the sound of shuffling papers. \"This woman, commonly known\nas Mother Taylor, is to be hanged this day sennight, I believe.\"\n\n\"Yea, my lord.\"\n\n\"And it hath been suggested that if she can lay before us such evidence\nas is needful, she will be commended to the King's mercy and doubtless\nreprieved from the gallows. Hath all this been made plain and clear to\nher?\"\n\n\"Yea, my lord.\"\n\n\"Hm! It appears by these papers, woman, that keeping a house to which\nrogues of all descriptions have resorted is the least of your crimes.\"\n\nA strange, cracked old voice burst shrilly upon the still court. \"'Tis\na lie, my lord! Alas, my lord, that wicked lies should take away my\ngood name, and I tottering on the edge of the grave!\"\n\nThere were cries of \"Silence!\" And the officer at the old woman's side\nshook her by the arm.\n\n\"And to continue from the least to the greatest, you have disposed of\nall manner of stolen goods, and have prepared slow poisons to be sold\nat a great price and have stained your hands with murder.\"\n\n\"Alas, my lord, it is a wicked lie--!\"\n\nThey shook her into silence, but her lips continued to move, and as she\nstood between the officers her sharp little eyes ranged about the court.\n\nThere was further counselling among the proctors, then one cried\nsharply, \"Come, old woman, remember that the hangman is ready to don\nhis gown, and answer me truly before it is too late: on such and such a\nday you were at your house in Bideford, were you not?\"\n\n\"Nay, sir, I am old and my wits are not all they were once and I cannot\nremember as I ought.\"\n\n\"Come, now, on such a day, did not a certain man come to your house in\nBideford and abide there the night?\"\n\n\"It may be--it may be--for one who keepeth a tavern hath many guests.\"\n\n\"Look about you, old woman, and tell us if you see the man.\"\n\n\"Nay, good sir, my wits wander and I do not remember as I used.\"\n\nAs Philip Marsham watched her hard face, so very old and crafty, he\npaid little heed to the low voices of the proctors and the Judge. But\nthe sharp command, \"Look this man in the face and tell us if you have\never seen him before,\" came to the erstwhile boatswain of the Rose of\nDevon like the shock of cold water to a man lying asleep.\n\nThey led her before Tom Jordan--before the Old One himself--and the two\nlooked each other full in the face, yet neither fluttered an eye. In\nall truth they were a cool pair; it had taken a Solomon to say which of\nthem was now the subtler.\n\n\"Nay, my lord, how should I know this man? He hath the look of an\nhonest fellow, my lord, but I never saw him ere this.\"\n\nThereupon the officers exchanged glances and the proctors whispered\ntogether.\n\nThey led her before Martin Barwick and again she shook her old white\nhead. \"Nay, my lord, I know him not.\" But Martin was swallowing hard,\nas if some kind of pip had beset him, and this did not escape the\nnotice of the Court.\n\nDown the line of accused men she came and, though she walked in the\nshadow of the gallows, she said of each, in her shrill, quavering old\nvoice, \"Nay, my lord, I know him not.\"\n\nOf some she spoke thus in all truth; of others, though she knew it\nwould cost her life, she craftily and stoutly lied. And at last she\ncame to Philip Marsham, whose heart chilled when he met the sharp eyes\nthat had looked so hard into his own in Bideford long before. \"Nay,\nmy lord, he is a handsome blade, but I never saw him ere this.\" Some\nsmiled and sniggered; but the old woman shrugged, and lifted her brows,\nand stood before the Court, wrinkled and bent by years of wickedness.\nSay what you will of her sins, her courage and loyalty were worthy of a\nbetter cause.\n\nIn despair of pinning her down, they led her away at last to a bench\nand there she sat with officers to guard her. Now she watched one man\nand now she watched another. Often Philip Marsham felt a tremor, almost\nof fear, at seeing her eyes looking hard into his own. But though of\nthe old woman the Court had made nothing, the exultation that showed\nin the faces of some of the prisoners was premature, for the Lords of\nAdmiralty had other shafts to their bow, as any gentleman of fortune\nmight have known they would.\n\nAgain there was a stir among the ushers, and in the door appeared one\nat whose coming Tom Jordan ceased to smile.\n\nThe fellow's chin sagged and his eyes were wild and he ducked to His\nLordship as if some one had pulled a string; and when they called on\nhim to give the Court his name he cried very tremulously, \"Yea, yea!\nJoseph Kirk, an it please you, my lord!\"\n\n\"Come now, look about you at these men who are arraigned for piracy.\nAre there any there whom you have seen elsewhere?\"\n\n\"Yea, yea, that there be! There! And there! And there!\"\n\n\"Ah! Hm! Men you have seen elsewhere! Tell us who they are.\" And His\nLordship smiled dryly.\n\n\"It is not to count against me, my lord? I have repented--yea, I have\nrepented! 'Twill not undo the King's pardon?\"\n\nThe very Judge on the bench gave a grunt as in disgust of the abject\nterror the fellow showed, and a murmur of impatience went through the\nroom; but though he afforded a spectacle for contempt, they reassured\nhim and urged him on.\n\n\"Yea, yea! That one there--he at the end--was our captain, and Tom\nJordan his name. It was he who led us against a vast number of prizes,\nwhich yielded rich profit. It was he and Harry Malcolm--why, Harry\nMalcolm is not here. Huh! 'Tis passing strange! He hath so often stole\nbeside them, I had thought he would hang beside them too. Yea, and as\nI was saying--Let us consider! Yea, yea, it was he and Harry Malcolm\nwho contrived the plan for killing Captain Candle and taking the Rose\nof Devon. Yea, they called me apart on the forecastle and tempted me to\nsin and forced me with many threats. He it was--\"\n\nTom Jordan was on his feet. \"You lie in your throat, you drunken dog!\nIt was you who struck him down with your own hand!\"\n\n\"Nay, nay! I did him no harm! It was another--I swear it was another!\"\n\n\"It seems,\" said His Lordship, when they had thrust Tom Jordan back in\nhis seat and had somewhat abated their witness's terror of his one-time\nchief, \"it seems this fellow's words have touched a sore. Go on.\"\n\n\"And there is Martin Barwick--nay, hold him! Nay, if I am to go on, I\nmust have protection!--and there Paul Craig and there our boatswain,\nPhilip Marsham--\" And so he continued to name the men and told a tale\nof shameful acts and crimes for the least of which a man is hanged.\nIndeed, Philip Marsham himself knew enough of their history to send\nthem one and all to the gallows, but he had not heard a tenth part\nof the story of piracy and robbery and murder and black crimes unfit\nfor the printed page that this renegade pirate told to the full Court\nof Admiralty. The fellow made a great story of it, yet kept within a\nbowshot of the truth; but he was a villain of mean spirit and, though\nhe did for the Court the work it desired, he bought his life at cost of\nwhatever honour he may have had left.\n\nAnd then came Captain Charles Winterton, who rose, bowing in stately\nwise to His Lordship, and with a composed air and an assured voice\nvery quietly drew tight the purse-strings of the net that Joe Kirk had\nknotted. In his grand and dignified manner he bowed now and then to His\nLordship and to the proctors, who asked him questions with a deference\nin their bearing very different from their way with the other witnesses.\n\n\"Yea, these pirate rogues boarded His Majesty's ship Sybil and killed\nthree of His Majesty's men before they perceived the blunder they had\nmade and gave themselves up.--How many lives did the boarders lose?\nProbably twelve or fourteen. Several bodies fell into the water and\nwere not recovered. It was useless to hunt for them, my lord. Great\nsharks abound in those waters.--Yea, this Thomas Jordan led them in\nperson. In truth, there is little distinction between them in the\nmatter of guilt. The man Marsham, whom the previous witness named a\nboatswain, was the first to board the Sybil. He entered the great cabin\nby way of the stem, apparently to spy out the situation on board. He\ndeclared himself a forced man who had run away from the pirates. Who\ncould say? The situation in which he was taken was such, certainly,\nas to incriminate him; though 'twere cause for sorrow, since he was a\nbrave lad and had given no trouble during the voyage home.\"\n\nThere was a great whispering among the people, who thought it was a\nshame for so likely a lad to hang with a pack of pirates. But it was\nplain by now to the greatest dullard among those unhappy gentlemen of\nfortune that hang they must; and for Philip Marsham, who sat as white\nas death from the shame of it, there was no slightest spark of hope.\nThe net was woven and knotted and drawn, and the end of it all was at\nhand.\n\nWhen, according to the custom of the time, they called on Tom Jordan\nfor his defense, he rose and said, \"Alas, my lord, the ropes are laid\nthat shall hang me. Already my neck aches. This, though, I will say:\nwhatever these poor men have done, it is I that compelled them into it,\nand I, my lord, will stand to answer for it.\"\n\nSome gave one defense and some another; and meanwhile there was much\nlegal talk, dry and long and hard to understand. And so at last they\ncalled on Philip Marsham to rise and speak for himself if he had\nanything to say in his own defense.\n\nHe rose and stood before them, very white of face, and though his voice\ntrembled, which was a thing to be expected since he saw before him a\nshameful death, he told them his true story, beginning with the day he\nsailed from Bideford, very much as I have told it here. But when they\nasked him about affairs on board the Rose of Devon that concerned the\nothers and not him, he replied that each man must tell his own tale and\nthat though he swung for it he must leave the others to answer those\nquestions for themselves.\n\n\"Come,\" quoth His Lordship, leaning forward and sharply tapping his\ntable, \"you have heard the question asked. Remember, young man, that\nyou stand in a place exceeding slippery. It shall profit you nothing to\nhold your peace.\"\n\n\"My lord,\" said he, \"the tale hath been told in full. There is no need\nthat I add to it, and were I to speak further I should but carry with\nme to the grave the thought that I had done a treacherous thing. Though\nI owe these men for nought save hard usage, yet have I eaten their\nbread and drunk their wine, and I will not, despite their sins, help to\nhang them.\"\n\nIt was doubtless very wrong for him to reply thus, as any moralist\nwill point out, since it is a man's duty to help enforce the laws by\nbringing criminals to justice. But he answered according to his own\nconscience; and after the craven talk of Joseph Kirk, the lad's frank\nand honest statement pleased perhaps even my Lord the Judge, sitting\nhigh above the court, who frowned because his position demanded frowns.\nSurely loyalty ranks high among the virtues and great credit is due to\na keen sense of personal honour. But there then came from his talk a\nresult that neither he nor any other had foreseen.\n\nUp sprang Tom Jordan. \"My lord,\" he cried, \"I pray thee for leave to\nspeak!\"\n\nTo the frowns and chidings of the officers who forced him down again,\nhe paid no heed. A tumult rose in the room, for they had hurled the Old\nOne back and clapped hands over his mouth; but out of the struggle came\nagain the cry, \"My lord! My lord!\" and His Lordship, calling in a loud\nvoice for order and silence, scowled and gave him the leave he asked.\n\nAs Martin had said long before, Tom Jordan was an ugly customer when\nhis temper was up and hot, but no man to nurse a grudge.\n\n\"I thank you, my lord,\" said he, the while smoothing his coat, which\nhad wrinkled sadly in the scuffle. \"Though I must hang I desire to see\njustice done. It lay in the power of this Philip Marsham to have added\nto the tale of our sins and the sum of our woes; wherefore, since he\nhath had the spirit to refrain from doing thus, why, my lord, I needs\nmust say that he hath spoken only the truth. He was a forced man, and\nhaving a liking for him, since he is a lad of spirit, I would have\nhad him join us heart and soul. 'Tis true likewise that he ran away\nfrom our ship and turned his hand against us, and for that I would have\nlet him hang with these other tall fellows but for the brave spirit he\nhath shown. But as for yonder swine--yea, thou, Joe Kirk! Quake and\nstare!--he hath done more mean, filthy tricks to earn a hanging than\nany other gentleman of fortune, I believe, that ever sailed the seas.\"\n\n\"Not so, my lord!\" Joe Kirk yelled. \"He fears me for my knowledge of\nhis deeds! Help! Hold him--hold him!\"\n\nTom Jordan swore a great oath and Joe Kirk leaped up in his seat, white\nand shaking, and cried over and over that it was all a lie, and there\nwas a merry time of it before the attendants restored peace.\n\nAnd then, to the further amazement of all in the court, Captain Charles\nWinterton again rose.\n\n\"If I may add a word, my lord? Thank you, my lord. I observed that when\nthe prisoners went below their manner toward this man Marsham was such\nas to lend a certain plausibility to his story. They took, in short, so\nvindictive a delight in his misfortunes that even then it seemed not\nbeyond reason that his tale was true and that he had indeed left them\nwithout leave. That, of course, proves nothing with regard to his being\na forced man; but it is a matter of common justice to say that, in\nconsideration of all that I have seen before and of that which I have\nthis day heard, I believe he hath told the truth both then and now.\nThank you, my lord.\"\n\nSuch a hullabaloo of talk as then burst forth among the spectators, and\nsuch learned argument as passed between the proctors and the Lieutenant\nof Admiralty and His Lordship the Judge, surpass imagination. Some\nquoted the Latin and the Greek, while others of less learning voiced\ntheir opinions in the vulgar tongue, so that all in all there was\nenough disputation to fuddle the wits of a mere layman by the time they\ngave the case to the jury.\n\nThen the jury, weighing all that had been said, put together its twelve\nheads, while such stillness prevailed in the court that a man could\nhear his neighbor's breathing. It seemed to those whose lives were at\nstake that the deliberations took as many hours as in reality they took\nminutes. There are times when every grain of sand in the glass seems\nto loiter in falling and to drift through the air like thistledown, as\nif unwilling to come to rest with its fellows below. Yet the sand is\nfalling as fast as ever, though a man whose life is weighing in the\nbalance can scarcely believe it; so at last the jury made an end of its\nwork, which after all had taken little enough time in consideration of\nthe matter they must decide.\n\n\"You have reached with due and faithful care a verdict in this matter?\"\nquoth His Lordship.\n\n\"We have, my lord.\"\n\n\"You will then declare your verdict to the Court.\"\n\n\"Of these fourteen prisoners at the bar of justice, my lord, we find\none and all guilty of the felonies and piracies that are charged\nagainst them, save only one man.\" In the deathly silence that fell upon\nthe room the name sounded forth like the stroke of a bell. \"We acquit,\nmy lord, Philip Marsham.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere and then Philip Marsham parted company with the men of the Rose\nof Devon. His hands shook when he rose a free man, and when many spoke\nto him in all friendliness he could find no voice to reply.\n\nNever again did he see their faces, but he heard long afterward of how,\na week from the day of their trial, they went down the river to Wapping\nin wherries, with the bright sun shining on the ships and on the shore\nwhere a great throng had assembled to see them march together up the\nstairs to Execution Dock.\n\nThough they had always made themselves out to appear great and fierce\nmen, yet on that last day they again showed themselves cravens at\nheart--except Tom Jordan. The Old One, stern, cold, shrewd, smiled at\nhis fellows and said, \"It is to be. May God have mercy on me!\" And\nthough he stood with the black cap over his eyes and the noose round\nhis neck, he never flinched.\n\nAs for Martin Barwick, his face grey with fear, he strove to break\naway, and cried out in English and in Spanish, and called on the\nVirgin. Sadly, though, had he fallen from the teachings of the Church,\nand little did his cries avail him! He came at the last to the end\nhe had feared from the first; and his much talk of hanging was thus\nrevealed to have been in a manner prophecy, although it sprang from no\nhigher oracle than his own cowardly heart.\n\nOne told Philip Marsham that Mother Taylor was hanged; another said\nthey let her go, to die a natural death in the shadow of the gallows\nthat stood by the crossroads in her native town of Barnstable. Either\ntale is likely enough, and Phil never learned which was true.\n\nFor aught I know to the contrary, she may have found an elixir of life\nas good as the one discovered by the famous Count de Saint-Germain,\nand so be living still.\n\nWhatever the end she came to, Phil Marsham was far away when they\ndetermined her fate. For the day he stepped out in the streets of\nLondon, a free man once more and a loyal subject of the King, he took\nthe road to the distant inn where he was of a mind to claim fulfillment\nof Nell Entick's promise.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII\n\nBACK TO THE INN\n\n\nIf this were a mere story to while away an idle hour, I, the scribe,\nwould tie neatly every knot and leave no Irish pennants hanging from\nmy work. But life, alas, is no pattern drawn to scale. The many\ninterweaving threads are caught up in strange tangles, and over them,\ndarkly and inscrutably, Atropos presides. Who cannot recall to mind\nnames and faces still alive with the friendship of a few weeks or\nmonths,--a friendship pleasant in memory,--a friendship that promised\nfruitful years, but that was lost for ever when a boy or man drifted\nout of sight for one reason or another, and on one tide or another of\nthe projects that go to make up life? To Philip Marsham, tramping again\nthe high roads of England, there came, mingled with many other desires,\na longing to see once more the Scottish smith who had wrought the dirk\nthat had tasted blood for his protection in those dark adventures at\nsea. But when he came to the smithy beside the heath he found it open\nand empty. The wind blew the door on rusty hinges; brown leaves had\ndrifted in and lay about the cold forge; the coals were dead, the\nbellows were broken, and the lonely man who had wrought iron on the now\nrusty anvil had taken his tools and gone.\n\nThe day was still young, for the wayfarer, starting early and in the\nfullness of his strength, had this day covered three miles in the time\nthat one had taken him when he walked that road before. So he left the\nsmithy and pushed on across the heath and far beyond it, marking each\nfamiliar farm and village and country house, until night had fallen and\nthe stars had come out, when he laid him down under a hedge and slept.\n\nHe was thinking, when he fell asleep, of Nell Entick. He remembered\nvery well her handsome face, her head held so high, her white throat\nand bare arms. He was going back to the inn to claim fulfillment of\nher promise and he pictured her as waiting for him there. In most ways\nhe was a bold, resolute youth who had seen much of life; but in some\nways, nevertheless, he was a lad of small experience, and if he thought\nat all that she had been a little overbold, a little overwilling, he\nthought only that she was as honestly frank as he.\n\nWaking that night upon his bed of leaves, he saw far away on a hill the\ndancing flames of a campfire, concerning which he greatly wondered.\nFor, having been long out of England, he had small knowledge of\nthe ups and downs of parliaments and kings; and in the brief time\nsince his return, of which he had spent nearly all in prison, he had\nheard nothing of the tumultuous state of the kingdom, save a few\nwords dropped here or there while he was passing through hamlets and\nvillages, and seen nothing thereof save such show of arms as in one\nplace or another had caught his eye but not his thought. Although he\nknew it not, since he was a plain lad with no gift of second-sight, he\nlay in a country poised on the brink of war and his bed was made in the\nfield where a great battle was to be fought.\n\nHe went on at daylight, and going through a village at high noon\nsaw a preacher in clipped hair and sober garb, who was calling on\nthe people to be valiant and of good courage against those wicked\nmen who had incited riot and rebellion among the Roman Catholics in\nIreland, whereby the King might find pretext for raising a vast army to\ndevastate and enslave England. Sorely perplexed by this talk, of which\nhe understood little, Phil besought a sneering young fellow, who stood\nat no great distance, for an explanation; to which the fellow replied\nthat it was talk for them that wore short hair and long ears, and that\nunless a man kept watch upon his wits his own ears would grow as long\nfrom hearing it as those of any Roundhead ass in the country. At this\nPhil took umbrage; but the fellow cried Nay, that he would fight no\nsuch keen blade, who was, it seemed, a better man than he looked. And\nwith a laugh he waved the matter off and strolled away.\n\nSo to the inn Phil came in due time, having meditated much, meanwhile,\non the talk of the King and war and the rights of Parliament, which was\nin the mouths and ears of all men. But he put such things out of his\nmind when at last he saw the inn, for the moment was at hand when his\ndreams should come true and he should find waiting for him the Nell\nEntick he remembered from long ago.\n\nSurely a lad of enterprise, who had ventured the world over with\npirates, could find in any English village something to which he could\nturn his hand. Indeed, who knew but some day he might keep the inn\nhimself--or do better? Who knew? He remembered Little Grimsby and drew\na long breath. Caught in a whirl of excitement that set the blood\ndrumming in his ears, he strode into the house and, boldly stepping up\nto the public bar, called loudly, \"Holla, I say! I would have speech of\nMistress Nell Entick.\"\n\nFrom a tall settle in the corner, where he sat taking tobacco, there\nrose a huge man with red and angry face.\n\n\"Who in the Devil's name art thou,\" he roared, \"that comes ranting into\nan honest house and bawls out thus the name of Mistress Nell Entick?\"\n\nThere were as usual a couple of countrymen sitting with pots of ale,\nwho reared their heads in vast amazement, and in the noisy kitchen\ndown the passage a perceptible hush followed the loud words. The house\nseemed to pause and listen; the countrymen set down their pots; there\nwas a sound of creaking hinges and of lightly falling feet.\n\nVery coolly, smiling slightly, Philip Marsham met the eyes of the big,\nred-faced man. \"It seems,\" said he, \"thou art riding for another fall.\"\n\nA look of recognition, at first incredulous, then profoundly\ndispleased, dawned on the red face and even greater anger followed.\n\n\"Thou banging, basting, broiling brogger!\" he thundered. \"Thou\nill-contrived, filthy villain! Out the door! Begone!\"\n\n\"It seems, Jamie Barwick, that thy wits are struck with years. Have\ncare. Thy brother is already on the road to Wapping--they have signed\nand sealed his passage.\"\n\nThe fat man came to Phil with the slow gait and the low-hung head of a\nsurly dog. He thrust his red face close to Phil's own.\n\n\"Yea, it is thou,\" he sneered. \"I am minded to beat thee and bang thee\ntill thou goest skulking under the hedges for cover. But it seems thou\nhast good news. What is this talk of the hangman's budget?\"\n\n\"It is true. By now thine excellent brother hath in all likelihood\ndonned the black cap and danced on air. As for beating and\nbanging--scratch thy head and agitate thy memory and consider if I have\ngiven thee reason to hope for quietness and submission.\"\n\nThere was a flicker of doubt in the man's small eyes, whereby it seemed\nhis memory served him well.\n\n\"And what meanest thou by saying thou would'st have speech of Mistress\nNell Entick?\" he asked suspiciously.\n\n\"That concerns thee not.\"\n\n\"Ha!\" He scowled darkly. \"Methinks it concerns me nearly!\"\n\nAnd then a high voice cried, \"Who called my name?\"\n\nThey turned and Phil Marsham's face lighted, for she stood in the door.\nShe was not so fair as he had pictured her--what lad's memory will not\nplay such tricks as that?--and he thought that when he had taken her\naway from the inn she need never again wear a drabbled gown. But it\nwas she, the Nell Entick who had so lightly given him her promise and\nkissed him as he fled, and he had come for her.\n\n\"Back again, John? Nay, John was not thy name. Stay! No, it hath\nescaped me, but I remember well thy face. And shall I bring thee ale?\nOr sack? We have some rare fine sack.\"\n\nHe stared at her as if he could not believe his ears had told him\nright. \"I have come,\" he said, \"to claim a certain promise--\"\n\nShe looked bewildered, puzzled, then laughed loudly. \"Silly boy!\" she\ncried. \"I am these six months a wife.\"\n\n\"A wife!\"\n\n\"Yea, and mine,\" cried Barwick. \"Come, begone I I'll have no puppies\nsniffling at her heels.\"\n\nAt something in the man's manner, the full truth dawned on Philip\nMarsham. \"I see. And you have taken the inn?\"\n\n\"Yea, that I have! Must I split thy head to let in knowledge? Begone!\"\n\nShe laid her hand on Barwick's wrist. \"The lad means no harm,\" she\nwhispered. \"Come, it is folly to drive trade away.\" And over Barwick's\nshoulder she cast Phil such a glance that he knew, maid or matron, she\nwould philander still.\n\nBut Phil had seen her with new eyes and the old charm was broken.\n(Perhaps if Tom Marsham had waited a year before he leaped into\nmarriage, I had had no story to tell!) All that was best in the father\nhad come down to the son, and Phil turned his back on the siren with\nthe bold, bright eyes. He turned his back on the inn, too, and all the\ndreams he had built around it--a boy's imaginings raised on the sands\nof a moment's fancy. Nay, he turned his back on all the world he had\nhitherto known.\n\nWith a feeling that he was rubbing from his face a spider's web of\nsordidness,--that he was cutting the last cord that bound him to his\nold, wild life,--stirred by a new and daring project, he went out of\nthe inn and turned to the left and took the road in search of Sir John\nBristol.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII\n\nAND OLD SIR JOHN\n\n\nSir John Bristol! There, gentlemen, was a brave, honest man! A man of\nspirit and of a humour! If you crossed him, if you toyed with him, his\nmirth was rough, his hand was hard, he was relentless as iron. But for\na man who stood his ground and fought a bold fight and met squarely the\nold man's eyes, there was nothing Sir John would not do.\n\nAfter all his weary travels by land and sea, Philip Marsham had at last\ncome back to find a man whom he had seen but once and for a brief time.\nYet in that man he had such complete confidence as he had never had in\nany other, and since Jamie Barwick had left the man's service and taken\nthe inn--who knew?\n\nStriding over the same rolling country road that he had tramped with\nMartin long before, and coming soon to the park, he skirted it and\npressed on, keeping meanwhile his eyes and wits about him, until\nhe perceived a gate and a porter's lodge. He went to the gate and\nfinding it ajar slipped through and made haste up a long avenue with\noverarching trees. A man from the lodge came out and angrily called\nafter the intruder, but Phil never looked back. The avenue turned to\nthe left and he saw at a distance the great house; he was of no mind to\nsuffer hindrance or delay.\n\nThe sunset sky threw long, still shadows across the grass, and\ncountless wandering branches of ivy lay like a dark drapery upon the\ngrey walls of the old house. A huge dog came bounding and roaring down\nthe avenue, but when the lad smiled without fear and reached a friendly\nhand toward him, the beast stopped clamouring and came quietly to heel.\nLights shone from the windows and softly on the still evening air the\nthin, sweet music of a virginal stole over the broad terraces and lawns.\n\nThe clamour of the dog, it seemed, had attracted the attention of those\nwithin, for a grey-haired servant met the stranger in the door. He\nstood there suspiciously, forbiddingly, and with a cold stare searched\nthe young man from head to heel.\n\n\"I would have speech of Sir John Bristol,\" said Phil.\n\nThe servant frowned. \"Nay, you have blundered,\" he replied haughtily.\n\"The servants' hall--\"\n\n\"I said Sir John.\"\n\n\"Sir John? It is--ahem!--impossible.\"\n\n\"I said Sir John.\"\n\nThe servant moved as if to shut the door.\n\n\"Come,\" said Phil quietly, \"enough of that! I will have speech of Sir\nJohn Bristol.\"\n\nFor a moment the servant hesitated, then from within a great voice\ncried, \"Come, Cobden, what's afoot?\"\n\nIn haughty disapproval of the lad without, the servant turned his back,\nbut to the man within he spoke with deference, as if apologizing. \"Yea,\nSir John. The fellow is insistent, but I shall soon have him off.\"\n\n\"Go, Cobden. Leave him to me.\"\n\nThe servant moved away and disappeared.\n\nThe virginalling had ceased, and on the lawns and the avenue and the\npark, which stretched away into the dark valley, a deep silence had\ncome with the twilight. The sun had set and the long shadows across\nthe grass were lost in the greater shadow of evening. As the world\nwithout had grown darker, the lights within seemed to have grown\nbrighter.\n\n\"Come, fellow, come into the hall. So! Have I not seen thee before?\"\n\n\"Yea, Sir John.\"\n\n\"Ha! I can remember faces. Aye, there are few that escape me. Let us\nconsider. Why, on my life! This is the lad that gave Barwick such a\ntumbling that the fellow walked lame for a month. Speak up! Have I not\nplaced thee right?\"\n\n\"Though I was faint for want of food, I was quicker on my feet than he.\"\n\nThe old man laughed until his brave curls shook.\n\n\"In faith, and it is said with moderation. And what now, lad? What hath\nbrought thee hither?\"\n\n\"Since Barwick hath left your service--\"\n\n\"That he hath, that he hath!\"\n\n\"It seemed there might be a place for a keeper.\"\n\n\"For a keeper? Ha, ha, ha! Nay, th' art too spirited a lad to waste\naway as keeper. Mark my word, lad, the King will shortly have need for\nsuch courageous gallants as thou. Unless I mistake thy spirit, we shall\nsoon see thee riding among the foremost when we chase these dogs of\nRoundheads into the King's kennels and slit their noses and prick their\nears as a warning to all of weak mind and base spirit.\"\n\n\"I have a taste for such sport, and God knows I am the King's man.\"\n\n\"Good, say I!\" Sir John's clear eyes searched the frank eyes of the\nlad, and the old man was pleased with what he found. \"Come, the cook\nshall fill thy belly and Cobden shall find thee a bed. Cobden! Cobden,\nI say!\"\n\n\"Yea, Sir John.\"\n\n\"Make place for this good fellow in the servants' hall and see that he\nhath all that he can eat and drink.\"\n\n\"Yea, Sir John.\"\n\n\"But stay a moment. Thy name, fellow.\"\n\n\"Philip Marsham.\"\n\n\"Philip Marsham?\" The heavy brows knotted and Sir John spoke musingly.\n\"Philip Marsham! I once knew a man of that name.\"\n\nSilence fell upon the hall. Grey Cobden stood a little behind his\nmaster, and when Phil looked past Sir John he saw standing in a door\nthe tall, quiet girl he had seen with the old knight that day in the\nwood so long since. Doubtless it was she who had played upon the\nvirginal. Her dark eyes and fine dignity wove a spell around the lad--a\nspell of the magic that has come down from the beginning of time--the\nmagic that is always young.\n\nTake such spells, such magic, as lightly as you please; yet they have\noverturned kingdoms and not once, but many times, have they launched a\nthousand ships.\n\n\"Did you ever hear of Dr. Marsham of Little Grimsby?\" Sir John asked,\nand he watched the lad very closely.\n\n\"Yea.\"\n\n\"And what have you heard of him?\"\n\n\"He is my grandfather.\"\n\n\"So!\" The old knight stepped back and bent his brows. \"Verily,\" he\nsaid, \"I believe the lad hath spoken truth. Go, Cobden. There is no\nplace in the hall for this lad.\"\n\nThe servant departed and the girl stepped nearer.\n\n\"Your father's name?\" Sir John said.\n\n\"My father's name was Thomas Marsham.\"\n\n\"Doubtless he bred you to the sea.\"\n\n\"He did.\"\n\n\"He broke the hearts of his father and his mother.\"\n\nPhil stood silent in the hall and looked Sir John in the eye. Since\nthere seemed to be no reply, he waited for the knight to speak again.\n\n\"Tom Marsham's father and mother are dead, but within the year, lad,\nthey stood where you are standing now. It was the last time I saw them.\"\n\nWhat could a young man say? Phil Marsham remembered well the one time\nhe had himself seen them. Who knew what might have happened had he\nspoken? But the chance was gone, and for ever.\n\n\"There is no place for Philip Marsham in my servants' hall,\" said Sir\nJohn. \"His father--but no! Let the dead lie. There is no place for\nPhilip Marsham in my servants' hall. Under my roof he is my guest.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV\n\nAND AGAIN THE ROSE OF DEVON\n\n\nThe story of Philip Marsham and of Sir John Bristol, and of the fortune\nleft by the good Doctor Marsham of Little Grimsby,--how it came to his\ngrandson and was lost in the war that brought ruin to many a noble\nfamily,--is a tale that may some day be worth the telling. Of that, I\nmake no promises.\n\nThe years that followed were wild and turbulent, but during their\npassage Phil chanced upon one reminder and another of his earlier days\nof adventuring. He saw once again the long, ranting madman who had\ncarried the great book. He might not have known the fellow, who was in\na company of Brownists or Anabaptists, or some such people, had he not\nheard him crying out in his voice like a cracked trumpet, to the great\nwonder and admiration of his fellows, \"Never was a man beset with such\ndiversity of thoughts.\" There was Jacob, too, who had sneaked away\nlike a rat on the eve of the day when Tom Jordan's schemes fell about\nhis ears: Phil once came upon him face to face, but when their eyes\nmet Jacob slipped round a corner and was gone. He was a subtle man and\nwise, and of no intention to be reminded of his days as a pirate.\n\nPhilip Marsham went to the war with Sir John Bristol, and fought for\nthe King, and rose to be a captain; and with the story of Philip\nMarsham is interwoven inseparably the story of Anne Bristol and of her\nfather, Sir John. For Sir John Bristol died at the second battle of\nNewbury with his head on Philip Marsham's knees; and in his grief at\nlosing the brave knight who had befriended him, the lad prayed God for\nvengeance on the Roundhead armies.\n\nAnd yet, though his grief was bitter, he had too just a mind to see\nonly one side of a great war. Once, when they sent him from the King's\ncamp on a secret mission, the enemy ran him to cover, and he escaped\nthem only by doubling back and hiding in the garret of a cottage\nwhere he lay high under the thatch and watched through a dusty little\nwindow the street from the Red Boar Inn down the hill to the distant\nmeadows, without being himself seen. He heard far away a murmur as\nof droning bees. Minutes passed and he heard the drone settle into a\nhollow rumble, from which there emerged after a time the remote sound\nof rattling drums and the occasional voices of shouting men. Then, of a\nsudden, there broke on the air a sound as of distant thunder, in which\nhe made out a chorus:--\n\n    \"His staff and rod shall comfort me,\n      His mantle e'er shall be my shield;\n    My brimming cup I hold in fee\n      Of him who rules the battlefield.\"\n\nThe voices of the singing men came booming over the meadows. They were\ndeep, strong voices and there was that in their volume and fierce\nearnestness which made a man shiver.\n\nPhil heard a dog barking; he saw a woman standing in the door of a\ncottage; he saw a cloud of dust rise above the meadow; then they came.\n\nFirst a band of men on foot in steel caps, with their firelocks\nshouldered, swinging out in long, firm strides. Then a little group\nof kettledrums, hammering away in a fierce rhythm. Then a number of\nhorsemen, with never a glint of gold on their bridles and never a curl\nfrom under their iron helms. Then, rank behind rank, a solid column of\nfoot that flowed along the dusty road over hillock and hollow, dark and\nsombre, undulating like a torpid stream of something thick and slow\nthat mightily forces a passage over every obstacle in its way.\n\nThey came up the hill, turning neither to right nor to left, up the\nhill and over it, and away to the north, where King Charles and all his\narmies lay.\n\nIt was a fearful sight, for they were stern, determined men. There\nwas no gallant flippancy in their carriage; there was no lordly show\nof ribbands and linen and gold and silver lace. They frowned as they\nmarched, and looked about them little. They bore so steadily on, they\nmade one feel they were men of tempered metal, men of no blood and no\nflesh, men with no love for the brave adventures of life, but with a\nstreak of iron in their very souls.\n\nPhilip Marsham had heard the men of the Rose of Devon go into battle\nwith cries and shouting, and laugh when they killed; he had seen old\nSir John Bristol throw back his head proudly and jest with the girls of\nthe towns on their march; but these were men of another pattern.\n\nHe became aware, as he watched them go by--and he then knew the meaning\nof fear, safely hidden though he was, behind the dirty and small window\nin the gable; for had one man of those thousands found him there, it\nwould have ended the fighting days of Philip Marsham--he became aware\nthat here was a courage so stubborn there was no mastering it; that\nhere was a purposeful strength such as all the wild blades in his\nmaster's camp could never match. Their faces showed it; the marching\nrhythm of the never-ending column was alive with it.\n\nBehind the first regiments of infantry, horsemen came, and, at an\ninterval in the ranks of the cavalry, five men rode together. The eyes\nof one, who led the four by a span or two, were bent on the road, and\nhis face was stern and strong and thoughtful. As Phil watched him,\nthe first hesitating surmisal became conviction, and long afterward\nhe learned that he had been right. From his gable window he had seen\nOliver Cromwell go by.\n\nAll that afternoon the column streamed on, and in the early darkness\nPhilip fell asleep to the sound of men marching. In the morning they\nwere gone, and he went on his way and fulfilled his mission; but though\nthe King's men fought with a gallantry that never lessened, the cause\nof the King was lost, and the day broke when Philip Marsham was ready\nto turn his back on England.\n\nSo he came a second time to the harbour of Bideford, in Devon, and had\nit in his mind to take ship for some distant land where he could forget\nthe years of his youth and early manhood. He was in the mood, then,\nto envy Sir John Bristol and all the gallant company that had died on\nthe fields of Naseby and Newbury, and of many another great battle;\nfor he was the King's man, and great houses of the country had fallen,\nand many lords and gentlemen whose estates had gone to pay the cost of\nCromwell's wars had as much reason as he, and more, to wonder, at the\nsight of deep water, whether it were better to die by one's own hand\nor to seek new fortunes beyond the sea.\n\nThere were many vessels in the harbour and his gaze wandered over\nthem, ships and pinks and ketches and a single galliot from the Low\nCountries, until his eyes came at last to one of singularly familiar\naspect. He looked at her a long time, then strolled down to the quay\nand accosted an aged man who was warming his rheumatic limbs in the sun.\n\n\"What ship is that,\" said Captain Marsham, \"which lies yonder, in line\nwith the house on the farther shore to the right of the three trees?\"\n\nThe aged man squinted over the harbour to pick up the bearings his\nquestioner had given him and cleared his throat with a husky cough.\n\n\"Why, that,\" he said, \"be\u00c3\u00abs the frigate they call Rose of Devon.\"\n\n\"The Rose of Devon--nay, she cannot be the Rose of Devon!\"\n\n\"Can and be\u00c3\u00abs. Why does 'ee look so queer, sir?\"\n\n\"Not the Rose of Devon!\"\n\n\"Art 'ee addled?\" He laughed like a cackling hen. \"Aye, an' yon's her\nmaster.\"\n\nThe master turned when the young captain accosted him, and replied,\nwith reasonable civility, \"Yea, the Rose of Devon, Captain Hosmer, at\nyour service, sir. Passage? Yea, we can take you, but you're a queer\nsort to ask passage ere you know whither she sails. Is it murder or\ntheft?\"\n\n\"Neither. The old order is changing and I would go abroad.\"\n\n\"To the colonies?\"\n\n\"They tell me all the colonies are of a piece with these Roundheads\nhere, and that as many psalms are whined in Boston in New England as in\nall the conventicles in London.\"\n\nHe laughed in good humour. \"You are rash,\" said he. \"Were I of the\nother side, your words might cost you your head. But we're going south\nto Barbados, and there you'll find men to your own taste.\"\n\nCaptain Philip Marsham wished no more than that. So he struck a bargain\nfor passage, and paid with gold, and sailed from England for the second\ntime in the old Rose of Devon, the dark frigate that by God's grace had\ncome back to Bideford in the hour when he most needed her.\n\n\nTHE END\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\n                           THE DARK FRIGATE\n\n                      _By_ CHARLES BOARDMAN HAWES\n\n\nThe frigate _Rose of Devon_ rescues from a wreck in mid-ocean twelve\nmen who show their gratitude by seizing the _Rose_, killing her captain\nand sailing toward the Caribbean where they hope to plunder Spanish\ntowns and galleons. Mistaking an English man-of-war for a merchantman,\nthey are captured and brought back to England for trial. Only one,\nan English lad, Philip Marsham, a member of the original crew of the\n_Rose_, is acquitted; and he, after adventures in the forces of King\nCharles, tires of Cromwell's England and sails for Barbados once more\non the _Rose of Devon_.\n\n\"The Dark Frigate\" has long been a favorite story for boys and in\n1924 was awarded the John Newbery Medal, given annually \"for the most\ndistinguished contribution to American literature for children.\"\n\nWhen \"The Dark Frigate\" was first published F. F. Van deWater in _The\nNew York Tribune_ said: \"No one, we think, has written so perfect a\npirate tale since 'Treasure Island'.\"\n\n_With frontispiece in full color by_ ANTON OTTO FISCHER\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\n                             THE MUTINEERS\n\n                      _By_ CHARLES BOARDMAN HAWES\n\n\nThis rousing pirate story of the Pacific has proved even more popular\nthan the author's Newbery Prize-winning \"The Dark Frigate.\" Originally\npublished as an Atlantic Monthly Press Book in 1920, it has delighted\nthousands of adventure-loving boys (and girls too!). From the moment\nwhen young Benjamin Lathrop of Salem signs up with Captain Whidden of\nthe _Island Princess_ the reader embarks on a reading voyage of high\nand gleaming excitement.\n\n\"There is the atmosphere of the old-time ships and the spirit of the\nsailors of a century ago--such as you find in the pages of Dana and\nStevenson....

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org\/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.

General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\nvolunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\nedition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":860,"split":"train"}
