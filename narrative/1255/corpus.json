{"ori_id":"6a871d6f5f4bd27168a57272d80b6eaff5a8329a","title":"Huntingtower (novel)","context":"Huntingtower (novel)\n The story revolves around the imprisonment under false pretenses by Bolshevik agents of an exiled Russian noblewoman. The Scottish local community mobilises to uncover and thwart the conspiracy against her, and to defend the neutrality of Scotland against the Russian revolutionary struggle. A plot based on espionage and covert violence is set against the seemingly tranquil Scottish rural backdrop, a narrative device commonly found in Buchan\u2019s novels. He uses this notably in The Thirty Nine Steps. The novel contrasts the domestic characters, heroes and villains, with their more alien Russian counterparts. Huntingtower is characteristic of Buchan\u2019s novels, particularly in its class-based paternalism; its xenophobic prejudices, which are mitigated by instinctive humanity and dry humour; and its shrewd common-sense understanding of personality and motivation. We see Buchan's class based paternalism in the attitudes of various characters, from Saskia's insistence on pointing out the former status of her Russian family to Phemie Morran's lifelong loyalty to the extinct Kennedy family, to whom she was once a domestic servant. Heritage and McCunn instantly react to the first foreign resident of Huntingtower, a man called Leon, whose unwholesome appearance Buchan describes with relish:\n\"He was a sturdy fellow in a suit of blackclothes which had not been made for him. He might have been a butler en deshabille, but for the presence of a pair of field boots into which he had tucked the ends of his trousers. The curious thing about him was his face, which was decorated with features so tiny as to give the impression of a monstrous child. Each in itself was well enough formed, but eyes, nose, mouth, chin were of smallness curiously out of proportion to the head and body. Such an anomaly might have been redeemed by the expression; good-humour would have invested it with an air of agreeable farce. But there was no friendliness in the man\u2019s face. It was set like a judge\u2019s in a stony impassiveness.\" Huntingtower chapter three.\nThe moment when Dickson McCunn relinquishes his timid wish to remain strictly inside the law and decides to take a hand against the foreign conspirators gives an ironic insight into McCunn's social conditioning, whereby the veranda is an acceptable way to break into a house and the coal hole is unacceptable.\n\"They both looked at Dickson, and Dickson, scarlet in the face, looked back at them. He had suddenly found the thought of a solitary march to Auchenlochan intolerable. Once again he was at the parting of the ways, and once more caprice determined his decision. That the coal-hole was out of the question had worked a change in his views, Somehow it seemed to him less burglarious to enter by a veranda. He felt very frightened but for the moment quite resolute. \u201cI\u2019m coming with you,\u201d he said.\" Huntingtower chapter five.\nIn this novel Buchan creates characters across a broad spectrum of Scottish social classes and backgrounds, and while no one except McCunn is presented in great depth, we are given sharp and revealing character sketches of other key characters. Heritage\u2019s single handed defence of the actual tower and his attempt to free-climb away from the burning building show not only his actions but his reasons and thinking, why he is doing what he is doing. Wee Jaikie's inner life is only hinted at occasionally, but his dogged perseverance and resourcefulness come through at several moments when his interventions are important. In the final resolution of the story, a band of adventurers ranging from an injured laird and his faithful menservants to a group of semi-outcast street urchins from Glasgow have bonded and have combined to fight for a common purpose, out of belief in right and wrong, and allegiance to Scotland.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of Huntingtower, by John Buchan\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

KER\n\n\n_If the Professor of Poetry in the University of Oxford has not\nforgotten the rock whence he was hewn, this simple story may give him an\nhour of entertainment. I offer it to you because I think you have met my\nfriend Dickson McCunn, and I dare to hope that you may even in your many\nsojournings in the Westlands have encountered one or other of the\nGorbals Die-Hards. If you share my kindly feeling for Dickson, you will\nbe interested in some facts which I have lately ascertained about his\nancestry. In his veins there flows a portion of the redoubtable blood of\nthe Nicol Jarvies. When the Bailie, you remember, returned from his\njourney to Rob Roy beyond the Highland Line, he espoused his housekeeper\nMattie, \"an honest man's daughter and a near cousin o' the Laird o'\nLimmerfield.\" The union was blessed with a son, who succeeded to the\nBailie's business and in due course begat daughters, one of whom married\na certain Ebenezer McCunn, of whom there is record in the archives of\nthe Hammermen of Glasgow. Ebenezer's grandson, Peter by name, was\nProvost of Kirkintilloch, and his second son was the father of my hero\nby his marriage with Robina Dickson, eldest daughter of one Robert\nDickson, a tenant-farmer in the Lennox. So there are coloured threads in\nMr. McCunn's pedigree, and, like the Bailie, he can count kin, should he\nwish, with Rob Roy himself through \"the auld wife ayont the fire at\nStuckavrallachan.\"_\n\n_Such as it is, I dedicate to you the story, and ask for no better\nverdict on it than that of that profound critic of life and literature,\nMr. Huckleberry Finn, who observed of the_ Pilgrim's Progress, _that he\n\"considered the statements interesting, but steep.\"_\n\nJ.

What shall we talk about?\"\n\nThe young man did not answer at once, for his gaze was held by her face.\nHe had never dreamed that the gawky and rather plain little girl whom he\nhad romped with long ago in Paris would grow into such a being. The\nclean delicate lines of her figure, the exquisite pure colouring of hair\nand skin, the charming young arrogance of the eyes--this was beauty, he\nreflected, a miracle, a revelation. Her virginal fineness and her dress,\nwhich was the tint of pale fire, gave her the air of a creature of ice\nand flame.\n\n\"About yourself, please, Saskia,\" he said. \"Are you happy now that you\nare a grown-up lady?\"\n\n\"Happy!\" Her voice had a thrill in it like music, frosty music. \"The\ndays are far too short. I grudge the hours when I must sleep. They say\nit is sad for me to make my d\u00c3\u00a9but in a time of war. But the world is\nvery kind to me, and after all it is a victorious war for our Russia.\nAnd listen to this, Quentin. To-morrow I am to be allowed to begin\nnursing at the Alexander Hospital. What do you think of that?\"\n\nThe time was January, 1916, and the place a room in the great Nirski\nPalace. No hint of war, no breath from the snowy streets, entered that\ncurious chamber where Prince Peter Nirski kept some of the chief of his\nfamous treasures. It was notable for its lack of drapery and\nupholstering--only a sofa or two and a few fine rugs on the cedar floor.\nThe walls were of a green marble veined like malachite, the ceiling was\nof darker marble inlaid with white intaglios. Scattered everywhere were\ntables and cabinets laden with celadon china, and carved jade, and\nivories, and shimmering Persian and Rhodian vessels. In all the room\nthere was scarcely anything of metal and no touch of gilding or bright\ncolour. The light came from green alabaster censers, and the place swam\nin a cold green radiance like some cavern below the sea. The air was\nwarm and scented, and though it was very quiet there, a hum of voices\nand the strains of dance music drifted to it from the pillared corridor\nin which could be seen the glare of lights from the great ballroom\nbeyond.\n\nThe young man had a thin face with lines of suffering round the mouth\nand eyes. The warm room had given him a high colour, which increased\nhis air of fragility. He felt a little choked by the place, which seemed\nto him for both body and mind a hot-house, though he knew very well that\nthe Nirski Palace on this gala evening was in no way typical of the land\nor its masters. Only a week ago he had been eating black bread with its\nowner in a hut on the Volhynian front.\n\n\"You have become amazing, Saskia,\" he said. \"I won't pay my old\nplayfellow compliments; besides, you must be tired of them. I wish you\nhappiness all the day long like a fairy-tale Princess. But a crock like\nme can't do much to help you to it. The service seems to be the wrong\nway round, for here you are wasting your time talking to me.\"\n\nShe put her hand on his. \"Poor Quentin! Is the leg very bad?\"\n\nHe laughed. \"Oh, no. It's mending famously. I'll be able to get about\nwithout a stick in another month, and then you've got to teach me all\nthe new dances.\"\n\nThe jigging music of a two-step floated down the corridor. It made the\nyoung man's brow contract, for it brought to him a vision of dead faces\nin the gloom of a November dusk. He had once had a friend who used to\nwhistle that air, and he had seen him die in the Hollebeke mud. There\nwas something _macabre_ in the tune.... He was surely morbid this\nevening, for there seemed something _macabre_ about the house, the room,\nthe dancing, all Russia.... These last days he had suffered from a sense\nof calamity impending, of a dark curtain drawing down upon a splendid\nworld. They didn't agree with him at the Embassy, but he could not get\nrid of the notion.\n\nThe girl saw his sudden abstraction.\n\n\"What are you thinking about?\" she asked. It had been her favourite\nquestion as a child.\n\n\"I was thinking that I rather wished you were still in Paris.\"\n\n\"But why?\"\n\n\"Because I think you would be safer.\"\n\n\"Oh, what nonsense, Quentin dear! Where should I be safe if not in my\nown Russia, where I have friends--oh, so many, and tribes and tribes of\nrelations? It is France and England that are unsafe with the German guns\ngrumbling at their doors.... My complaint is that my life is too\ncosseted and padded. I am too secure, and I do not want to be secure.\"\n\nThe young man lifted a heavy casket from a table at his elbow. It was of\ndark green imperial jade, with a wonderfully carved lid. He took off the\nlid and picked up three small oddments of ivory--a priest with a beard,\na tiny soldier and a draught-ox. Putting the three in a triangle, he\nbalanced the jade box on them.\n\n\"Look, Saskia! If you were living inside that box you would think it\nvery secure. You would note the thickness of the walls and the hardness\nof the stone, and you would dream away in a peaceful green dusk. But all\nthe time it would be held up by trifles--brittle trifles.\"\n\nShe shook her head. \"You do not understand. You cannot understand. We\nare a very old and strong people with roots deep, deep in the earth.\"\n\n\"Please God you are right,\" he said. \"But, Saskia, you know that if I\ncan ever serve you, you have only to command me. Now I can do no more\nfor you than the mouse for the lion--at the beginning of the story. But\nthe story had an end, you remember, and some day it may be in my power\nto help you. Promise to send for me.\"\n\nThe girl laughed merrily. \"The King of Spain's daughter,\" she quoted,\n\n    \"Came to visit me,\n     And all for the love\n     Of my little nut-tree.\"\n\nThe other laughed also, as a young man in the uniform of the\nPreobrajenski Guard approached to claim the girl. \"Even a nut-tree may\nbe a shelter in a storm,\" he said.\n\n\"Of course I promise, Quentin,\" she said. \"_Au revoir._ Soon I will come\nand take you to supper, and we will talk of nothing but nut-trees.\"\n\nHe watched the two leave the room, her gown glowing like a tongue of\nfire in the shadowy archway. Then he slowly rose to his feet, for he\nthought that for a little he would watch the dancing. Something moved\nbeside him, and he turned in time to prevent the jade casket from\ncrashing to the floor. Two of the supports had slipped.\n\nHe replaced the thing on its proper table and stood silent for a\nmoment.\n\n\"The priest and the soldier gone, and only the beast of burden left....\nIf I were inclined to be superstitious, I should call that a dashed bad\nomen.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\nHOW A RETIRED PROVISION MERCHANT FELT THE IMPULSE OF SPRING\n\n\nMr. Dickson McCunn completed the polishing of his smooth cheeks with the\ntowel, glanced appreciatively at their reflection in the looking-glass,\nand then permitted his eyes to stray out of the window. In the little\ngarden lilacs were budding, and there was a gold line of daffodils\nbeside the tiny greenhouse. Beyond the sooty wall a birch flaunted its\nnew tassels, and the jackdaws were circling about the steeple of the\nGuthrie Memorial Kirk. A blackbird whistled from a thorn-bush, and Mr.\nMcCunn was inspired to follow its example. He began a tolerable version\nof \"Roy's Wife of Aldivalloch.\"\n\nHe felt singularly light-hearted, and the immediate cause was his safety\nrazor. A week ago he had bought the thing in a sudden fit of enterprise,\nand now he shaved in five minutes, where before he had taken twenty, and\nno longer confronted his fellows, at least one day in three, with a\ncountenance ludicrously mottled by sticking-plaster. Calculation\nrevealed to him the fact that in his fifty-five years, having begun to\nshave at eighteen, he had wasted three thousand three hundred and\nseventy hours--or one hundred and forty days--or between four and five\nmonths--by his neglect of this admirable invention. Now he felt that he\nhad stolen a march on Time. He had fallen heir, thus late, to a fortune\nin unpurchasable leisure.\n\nHe began to dress himself in the sombre clothes in which he had been\naccustomed for thirty-five years and more to go down to the shop in\nMearns Street. And then a thought came to him which made him discard the\ngrey-striped trousers, sit down on the edge of his bed, and muse.\n\nSince Saturday the shop was a thing of the past. On Saturday at\nhalf-past eleven, to the accompaniment of a glass of dubious sherry, he\nhad completed the arrangements by which the provision shop in Mearns\nStreet, which had borne so long the legend of D. McCunn, together with\nthe branches in Crossmyloof and the Shaws, became the property of a\ncompany, yclept the United Supply Stores, Limited. He had received in\npayment cash, debentures and preference shares, and his lawyers and his\nown acumen had acclaimed the bargain. But all the week-end he had been a\nlittle sad. It was the end of so old a song, and he knew no other tune\nto sing. He was comfortably off, healthy, free from any particular cares\nin life, but free too from any particular duties. \"Will I be going to\nturn into a useless old man?\" he asked himself.\n\nBut he had woke up this Monday to the sound of the blackbird, and the\nworld, which had seemed rather empty twelve hours before, was now brisk\nand alluring. His prowess in quick shaving assured him of his youth.\n\"I'm no' that dead old,\" he observed, as he sat on the edge of the bed,\nto his reflection in the big looking-glass.\n\nIt was not an old face. The sandy hair was a little thin on the top and\na little grey at the temples, the figure was perhaps a little too full\nfor youthful elegance, and an athlete would have censured the neck as\ntoo fleshy for perfect health. But the cheeks were rosy, the skin clear,\nand the pale eyes singularly childlike. They were a little weak, those\neyes, and had some difficulty in looking for long at the same object, so\nthat Mr. McCunn did not stare people in the face, and had, in\nconsequence, at one time in his career acquired a perfectly undeserved\nreputation for cunning. He shaved clean, and looked uncommonly like a\nwise, plump schoolboy. As he gazed at his simulacrum he stopped\nwhistling \"Roy's Wife\" and let his countenance harden into a noble\nsternness. Then he laughed, and observed in the language of his youth\nthat \"There was life in the auld dowg yet.\" In that moment the soul of\nMr. McCunn conceived the Great Plan.\n\nThe first sign of it was that he swept all his business garments\nunceremoniously on to the floor. The next that he rootled at the bottom\nof a deep drawer and extracted a most disreputable tweed suit. It had\nonce been what I believe is called a Lovat mixture, but was now a\nnondescript sub-fusc, with bright patches of colour like moss on\nwhinstone. He regarded it lovingly, for it had been for twenty years his\nholiday wear, emerging annually for a hallowed month to be stained with\nsalt and bleached with sun. He put it on, and stood shrouded in an\nodour of camphor. A pair of thick nailed boots and a flannel shirt and\ncollar completed the equipment of the sportsman. He had another long\nlook at himself in the glass, and then descended whistling to breakfast.\nThis time the tune was \"Macgregor's Gathering,\" and the sound of it\nstirred the grimy lips of a man outside who was delivering\ncoals--himself a Macgregor--to follow suit. Mr. McCunn was a very\nfountain of music that morning.\n\nTibby, the aged maid, had his newspaper and letters waiting by his\nplate, and a dish of ham and eggs frizzling near the fire. He fell to\nravenously but still musingly, and he had reached the stage of scones\nand jam before he glanced at his correspondence. There was a letter from\nhis wife now holidaying at the Neuk Hydropathic. She reported that her\nhealth was improving, and that she had met various people who had known\nsomebody who had known somebody else whom she had once known herself.\nMr. McCunn read the dutiful pages and smiled. \"Mamma's enjoying herself\nfine,\" he observed to the teapot. He knew that for his wife the earthly\nparadise was a hydropathic, where she put on her afternoon dress and\nevery jewel she possessed when she rose in the morning, ate large meals\nof which the novelty atoned for the nastiness, and collected an immense\ncasual acquaintance with whom she discussed ailments, ministers, sudden\ndeaths, and the intricate genealogies of her class. For his part he\nrancorously hated hydropathics, having once spent a black week under the\nroof of one in his wife's company. He detested the food, the Turkish\nbaths (he had a passionate aversion to baring his body before\nstrangers), the inability to find anything to do and the compulsion to\nendless small talk. A thought flitted over his mind which he was too\nloyal to formulate. Once he and his wife had had similar likings, but\nthey had taken different roads since their child died. Janet! He saw\nagain--he was never quite free from the sight--the solemn little\nwhite-frocked girl who had died long ago in the spring.\n\nIt may have been the thought of the Neuk Hydropathic, or more likely the\nthin clean scent of the daffodils with which Tibby had decked the table,\nbut long ere breakfast was finished the Great Plan had ceased to be an\nairy vision and become a sober well-masoned structure. Mr. McCunn--I may\nconfess it at the start--was an incurable romantic.\n\nHe had had a humdrum life since the day when he had first entered his\nuncle's shop with the hope of some day succeeding that honest grocer;\nand his feet had never strayed a yard from his sober rut. But his mind,\nlike the Dying Gladiator's, had been far away. As a boy he had voyaged\namong books, and they had given him a world where he could shape his\ncareer according to his whimsical fancy. Not that Mr. McCunn was what is\nknown as a great reader. He read slowly and fastidiously, and sought in\nliterature for one thing alone. Sir Walter Scott had been his first\nguide, but he read the novels not for their insight into human character\nor for their historical pageantry, but because they gave him material\nwherewith to construct fantastic journeys. It was the same with\nDickens. A lit tavern, a stage-coach, post-horses, the clack of hoofs on\na frosty road, went to his head like wine. He was a Jacobite not because\nhe had any views on Divine Right, but because he had always before his\neyes a picture of a knot of adventurers in cloaks, new landed from\nFrance, among the western heather.\n\nOn this select basis he had built up his small library--Defoe, Hakluyt,\nHazlitt and the essayists, Boswell, some indifferent romances and a\nshelf of spirited poetry. His tastes became known, and he acquired a\nreputation for a scholarly habit. He was president of the Literary\nSociety of the Guthrie Memorial Kirk, and read to its members a variety\nof papers full of a gusto which rarely became critical. He had been\nthree times chairman at Burns Anniversary dinners, and had delivered\norations in eulogy of the national Bard; not because he greatly admired\nhim--he thought him rather vulgar--but because he took Burns as an\nemblem of the un-Burns-like literature which he loved. Mr. McCunn was no\nscholar and was sublimely unconscious of background. He grew his flowers\nin his small garden-plot oblivious of their origin so long as they gave\nhim the colour and scent he sought. Scent, I say, for he appreciated\nmore than the mere picturesque. He had a passion for words and cadences,\nand would be haunted for weeks by a cunning phrase, savouring it as a\nconnoisseur savours a vintage. Wherefore long ago, when he could ill\nafford it, he had purchased the Edinburgh _Stevenson_. They were the\nonly large books on his shelves, for he had a liking for small\nvolumes--things he could stuff into his pocket in that sudden journey\nwhich he loved to contemplate.\n\nOnly he had never taken it. The shop had tied him up for eleven months\nin the year, and the twelfth had always found him settled decorously\nwith his wife in some seaside villa. He had not fretted, for he was\ncontent with dreams. He was always a little tired, too, when the\nholidays came, and his wife told him he was growing old. He consoled\nhimself with tags from the more philosophic of his authors, but he\nscarcely needed consolation. For he had large stores of modest\ncontentment.\n\nBut now something had happened. A spring morning and a safety razor had\nconvinced him that he was still young. Since yesterday he was a man of a\nlarge leisure. Providence had done for him what he would never have done\nfor himself. The rut in which he had travelled so long had given place\nto open country. He repeated to himself one of the quotations with which\nhe had been wont to stir the literary young men at the Guthrie Memorial\nKirk:\n\n    \"What's a man's age? He must hurry more, that's all;\n       Cram in a day, what his youth took a year to hold:\n       When we mind labour, then only, we're too old--\n     What age had Methusalem when he begat Saul?\"\n\nHe would go journeying--who but he?--pleasantly.\n\nIt sounds a trivial resolve, but it quickened Mr. McCunn to the depths\nof his being. A holiday, and alone! On foot, of course, for he must\ntravel light. He would buckle on a pack after the approved fashion. He\nhad the very thing in a drawer upstairs, which he had bought some years\nago at a sale. That and a waterproof and a stick, and his outfit was\ncomplete. A book, too, and, as he lit his first pipe, he considered what\nit should be. Poetry, clearly, for it was the Spring, and besides poetry\ncould be got in pleasantly small bulk. He stood before his bookshelves\ntrying to select a volume, rejecting one after another as inapposite.\nBrowning--Keats, Shelley--they seemed more suited for the hearth than\nfor the roadside. He did not want anything Scots, for he was of opinion\nthat Spring came more richly in England and that English people had a\nbetter notion of it. He was tempted by the Oxford Anthology, but was\ndeterred by its thickness, for he did not possess the thin-paper\nedition. Finally he selected Izaak Walton. He had never fished in his\nlife, but _The Compleat Angler_ seemed to fit his mood. It was old and\ncurious and learned and fragrant with the youth of things. He remembered\nits falling cadences, its country songs and wise meditations. Decidedly\nit was the right scrip for his pilgrimage.\n\nCharacteristically he thought last of where he was to go. Every bit of\nthe world beyond his front door had its charms to the seeing eye. There\nseemed nothing common or unclean that fresh morning. Even a walk among\ncoal-pits had its attractions.... But since he had the right to choose,\nhe lingered over it like an epicure. Not the Highlands, for Spring came\nlate among their sour mosses. Some place where there were fields and\nwoods and inns, somewhere, too, within call of the sea. It must not be\ntoo remote, for he had no time to waste on train journeys; nor too near,\nfor he wanted a countryside untainted. Presently he thought of Carrick.\nA good green land, as he remembered it, with purposeful white roads and\npublic-houses sacred to the memory of Burns; near the hills but yet\nlowland, and with a bright sea chafing on its shores. He decided on\nCarrick, found a map and planned his journey.\n\nThen he routed out his knapsack, packed it with a modest change of\nraiment, and sent out Tibby to buy chocolate and tobacco and to cash a\ncheque at the Strathclyde Bank. Till Tibby returned he occupied himself\nwith delicious dreams.... He saw himself daily growing browner and\nleaner, swinging along broad highways or wandering in bypaths. He\npictured his seasons of ease, when he unslung his pack and smoked in\nsome clump of lilacs by a burnside--he remembered a phrase of\nStevenson's somewhat like that. He would meet and talk with all sorts of\nfolk; an exhilarating prospect, for Mr. McCunn loved his kind. There\nwould be the evening hour before he reached his inn, when, pleasantly\ntired, he would top some ridge and see the welcoming lights of a little\ntown. There would be the lamp-lit after-supper time when he would read\nand reflect, and the start in the gay morning, when tobacco tastes\nsweetest and even fifty-five seems young. It would be holiday of the\npurest, for no business now tugged at his coat-tails. He was beginning a\nnew life, he told himself, when he could cultivate the seedling\ninterests which had withered beneath the far-reaching shade of the shop.\nWas ever a man more fortunate or more free?\n\nTibby was told that he was going off for a week or two. No letters need\nbe forwarded, for he would be constantly moving, but Mrs. McCunn at the\nNeuk Hydropathic would be kept informed of his whereabouts. Presently he\nstood on his doorstep, a stocky figure in ancient tweeds, with a bulging\npack slung on his arm, and a stout hazel stick in his hand. A passer-by\nwould have remarked an elderly shopkeeper bent apparently on a day in\nthe country, a common little man on a prosaic errand. But the passer-by\nwould have been wrong, for he could not see into the heart. The plump\ncitizen was the eternal pilgrim; he was Jason, Ulysses, Eric the Red,\nAlbuquerque, Cortez--starting out to discover new worlds.\n\nBefore he left Mr. McCunn had given Tibby a letter to post. That morning\nhe had received an epistle from a benevolent acquaintance, one\nMackintosh, regarding a group of urchins who called themselves the\n\"Gorbals Die-Hards.\" Behind the premises in Mearns Street lay a tract of\nslums, full of mischievous boys with whom his staff waged truceless war.\nBut lately there had started among them a kind of unauthorised and\nunofficial Boy Scouts, who, without uniform or badge or any kind of\nparaphernalia, followed the banner of Sir Robert Baden-Powell and\nsubjected themselves to a rude discipline. They were far too poor to\njoin an orthodox troop, but they faithfully copied what they believed to\nbe the practices of more fortunate boys. Mr. McCunn had witnessed their\npathetic parades, and had even passed the time of day with their leader,\na red-haired savage called Dougal. The philanthropic Mackintosh had\ntaken an interest in the gang and now desired subscriptions to send them\nto camp in the country.\n\nMr. McCunn, in his new exhilaration, felt that he could not deny to\nothers what he proposed for himself. His last act before leaving was to\nsend Mackintosh ten pounds.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nOF MR. JOHN HERITAGE AND THE DIFFERENCE IN POINTS OF VIEW\n\n\nDickson McCunn was never to forget the first stage in that pilgrimage. A\nlittle after midday he descended from a grimy third-class carriage at a\nlittle station whose name I have forgotten. In the village near-by he\npurchased some new-baked buns and ginger biscuits, to which he was\npartial, and followed by the shouts of urchins, who admired his\npack--\"Look at the auld man gaun to the schule\"--he emerged into open\ncountry. The late April noon gleamed like a frosty morning, but the air,\nthough tonic, was kind. The road ran over sweeps of moorland where\ncurlews wailed, and into lowland pastures dotted with very white, very\nvocal lambs. The young grass had the warm fragrance of new milk. As he\nwent he munched his buns, for he had resolved to have no plethoric\nmidday meal, and presently he found the burnside nook of his fancy, and\nhalted to smoke. On a patch of turf close to a grey stone bridge he had\nout his Walton and read the chapter on \"The Chavender or Chub.\" The\ncollocation of words delighted him and inspired him to verse. \"Lavender\nor Lub\"--\"Pavender or Pub\"--\"Gravender or Grub\"--but the monosyllables\nproved too vulgar for poetry. Regretfully he desisted.\n\nThe rest of the road was as idyllic as the start. He would tramp\nsteadily for a mile or so and then saunter, leaning over bridges to\nwatch the trout in the pools, admiring from a dry-stone dyke the\nunsteady gambols of new-born lambs, kicking up dust from strips of\nmoor-burn on the heather. Once by a fir-wood he was privileged to\nsurprise three lunatic hares waltzing. His cheeks glowed with the sun;\nhe moved in an atmosphere of pastoral, serene and contented. When the\nshadows began to lengthen he arrived at the village of Cloncae, where he\nproposed to lie. The inn looked dirty, but he found a decent widow,\nabove whose door ran the legend in home-made lettering, \"Mrs. brockie\ntea and Coffee,\" and who was willing to give him quarters. There he\nsupped handsomely off ham and eggs, and dipped into a work called\n_Covenanting Worthies_, which garnished a table decorated with\nsea-shells. At half-past nine precisely he retired to bed and\nunhesitating sleep.\n\nNext morning he awoke to a changed world. The sky was grey and so low\nthat his outlook was bounded by a cabbage garden, while a surly wind\nprophesied rain. It was chilly, too, and he had his breakfast beside the\nkitchen fire. Mrs. Brockie could not spare a capital letter for her\nsurname on the signboard, but she exalted it in her talk. He heard of a\nmultitude of Brockies, ascendant, descendant and collateral, who seemed\nto be in a fair way to inherit the earth. Dickson listened\nsympathetically, and lingered by the fire. He felt stiff from\nyesterday's exercise, and the edge was off his spirit.\n\nThe start was not quite what he had pictured. His pack seemed heavier,\nhis boots tighter, and his pipe drew badly. The first miles were all\nuphill, with a wind tingling his ears, and no colours in the landscape\nbut brown and grey. Suddenly he awoke to the fact that he was dismal,\nand thrust the notion behind him. He expanded his chest and drew in long\ndraughts of air. He told himself that this sharp weather was better than\nsunshine. He remembered that all travellers in romances battled with\nmist and rain. Presently his body recovered comfort and vigour, and his\nmind worked itself into cheerfulness.\n\nHe overtook a party of tramps and fell into talk with them. He had\nalways had a fancy for the class, though he had never known anything\nnearer it than city beggars. He pictured them as philosophic vagabonds,\nfull of quaint turns of speech, unconscious Borrovians. With these\nsamples his disillusionment was speedy. The party was made up of a\nferret-faced man with a red nose, a draggle-tailed woman, and a child in\na crazy perambulator. Their conversation was one-sided, for it\nimmediately resolved itself into a whining chronicle of misfortunes and\npetitions for relief. It cost him half a crown to be rid of them.\n\nThe road was alive with tramps that day. The next one did the accosting.\nHailing Mr. McCunn as \"Guv'nor,\" he asked to be told the way to\nManchester. The objective seemed so enterprising that Dickson was\nimpelled to ask questions, and heard, in what appeared to be in the\naccents of the Colonies, the tale of a career of unvarying calamity.\nThere was nothing merry or philosophic about this adventurer. Nay, there\nwas something menacing. He eyed his companion's waterproof covetously,\nand declared that he had had one like it which had been stolen from him\nthe day before. Had the place been lonely he might have contemplated\nhighway robbery, but they were at the entrance to a village, and the\nsight of a public-house awoke his thirst. Dickson parted with him at the\ncost of sixpence for a drink.\n\nHe had no more company that morning except an aged stone-breaker whom he\nconvoyed for half a mile. The stone-breaker also was soured with the\nworld. He walked with a limp, which, he said, was due to an accident\nyears before, when he had been run into by \"ane o' thae damned\nvelocipeeds.\" The word revived in Dickson memories of his youth, and he\nwas prepared to be friendly. But the ancient would have none of it. He\ninquired morosely what he was after, and, on being told, remarked that\nhe might have learned more sense. \"It's a daft-like thing for an auld\nman like you to be traivellin' the roads. Ye maun be ill-off for a job.\"\nQuestioned as to himself he became, as the newspapers say, \"reticent,\"\nand having reached his bing of stones, turned rudely to his duties.\n\"Awa' hame wi' ye,\" were his parting words. \"It's idle scoondrels like\nyou that maks wark for honest folk like me.\"\n\nThe morning was not a success, but the strong air had given Dickson such\nan appetite that he resolved to break his rule, and, on reaching the\nlittle town of Kilchrist, he sought luncheon at the chief hotel. There\nhe found that which revived his spirits. A solitary bagman shared the\nmeal, who revealed the fact that he was in the grocery line. There\nfollowed a well-informed and most technical conversation. He was drawn\nto speak of the United Supply Stores, Limited, of their prospects and of\ntheir predecessor, Mr. McCunn, whom he knew well by repute but had never\nmet. \"Yon's the clever one,\" he observed. \"I've always said there's no\nlonger head in the city of Glasgow than McCunn. An old-fashioned firm,\nbut it has aye managed to keep up with the times. He's just retired,\nthey tell me, and in my opinion it's a big loss to the provision\ntrade....\" Dickson's heart glowed within him. Here was Romance; to be\npraised incognito; to enter a casual inn and find that fame had preceded\nhim. He warmed to the bagman, insisted on giving him a liqueur and a\ncigar, and finally revealed himself. \"I'm Dickson McCunn,\" he said,\n\"taking a bit holiday. If there's anything I can do for you when I get\nback, just let me know.\" With mutual esteem they parted.\n\nHe had need of all his good spirits, for he emerged into an unrelenting\ndrizzle. The environs of Kilchrist are at the best unlovely, and in the\nwet they were as melancholy as a graveyard. But the encounter with the\nbagman had worked wonders with Dickson, and he strode lustily into the\nweather, his waterproof collar buttoned round his chin. The road climbed\nto a bare moor, where lagoons had formed in the ruts, and the mist\nshowed on each side only a yard or two of soaking heather. Soon he was\nwet; presently every part of him, boots, body and pack, was one vast\nsponge. The waterproof was not water-proof, and the rain penetrated to\nhis most intimate garments. Little he cared. He felt lighter, younger,\nthan on the idyllic previous day. He enjoyed the buffets of the storm,\nand one wet mile succeeded another to the accompaniment of Dickson's\nshouts and laughter. There was no one abroad that afternoon, so he could\ntalk aloud to himself and repeat his favourite poems. About five in the\nevening there presented himself at the Black Bull Inn at Kirkmichael a\nsoaked, disreputable, but most cheerful traveller.\n\nNow the Black Bull at Kirkmichael is one of the few very good inns left\nin the world. It is an old place and an hospitable, for it has been for\ngenerations a haunt of anglers, who above all other men understand\ncomfort. There are always bright fires there, and hot water, and old\nsoft leather armchairs, and an aroma of good food and good tobacco, and\ngiant trout in glass cases, and pictures of Captain Barclay of Urie\nwalking to London, and Mr. Ramsay of Barnton winning a horse-race, and\nthe three-volume edition of the Waverley Novels with many volumes\nmissing, and indeed all those things which an inn should have. Also\nthere used to be--there may still be--sound vintage claret in the\ncellars. The Black Bull expects its guests to arrive in every stage of\ndishevelment, and Dickson was received by a cordial landlord, who\noffered dry garments as a matter of course. The pack proved to have\nresisted the elements, and a suit of clothes and slippers were provided\nby the house. Dickson, after a glass of toddy, wallowed in a hot bath,\nwhich washed all the stiffness out of him. He had a fire in his bedroom,\nbeside which he wrote the opening passages of that diary he had vowed to\nkeep, descanting lyrically upon the joys of ill weather. At seven\no'clock, warm and satisfied in soul, and with his body clad in raiment\nseveral sizes too large for it, he descended to dinner.\n\nAt one end of the long table in the dining-room sat a group of anglers.\nThey looked jovial fellows, and Dickson would fain have joined them;\nbut, having been fishing all day in the Loch o' the Threshes, they were\ntalking their own talk, and he feared that his admiration for Izaak\nWalton did not qualify him to butt into the erudite discussions of\nfishermen. The landlord seemed to think likewise, for he drew back a\nchair for him at the other end, where sat a young man absorbed in a\nbook. Dickson gave him good evening and got an abstracted reply. The\nyoung man supped the Black Bull's excellent broth with one hand, and\nwith the other turned the pages of his volume. A glance convinced\nDickson that the work was French, a literature which did not interest\nhim. He knew little of the tongue and suspected it of impropriety.\n\nAnother guest entered and took the chair opposite the bookish young man.\nHe was also young--not more than thirty-three--and to Dickson's eye, was\nthe kind of person he would have liked to resemble. He was tall and\nfree from any superfluous flesh; his face was lean, fine-drawn and\ndeeply sunburnt so that the hair above showed oddly pale; the hands were\nbrown and beautifully shaped, but the forearm revealed by the loose\ncuffs of his shirt was as brawny as a blacksmith's. He had rather pale\nblue eyes, which seemed to have looked much at the sun, and a small\nmoustache the colour of ripe hay. His voice was low and pleasant, and he\npronounced his words precisely, like a foreigner.\n\nHe was very ready to talk, but in defiance of Dr. Johnson's warning, his\ntalk was all questions. He wanted to know everything about the\nneighbourhood--who lived in what houses, what were the distances between\nthe towns, what harbours would admit what class of vessel. Smiling\nagreeably, he put Dickson through a catechism to which he knew none of\nthe answers. The landlord was called in, and proved more helpful. But on\none matter he was fairly at a loss. The catechist asked about a house\ncalled Darkwater, and was met with a shake of the head. \"I know no\nsic-like name in this countryside, sir,\" and the catechist looked\ndisappointed.\n\nThe literary young man said nothing, but ate trout abstractedly, one eye\non his book. The fish had been caught by the anglers in the Loch o' the\nThreshes, and phrases describing their capture floated from the other\nend of the table. The young man had a second helping, and then refused\nthe excellent hill mutton that followed, contenting himself with cheese.\nNot so Dickson and the catechist. They ate everything that was set\nbefore them, topping up with a glass of port. Then the latter, who had\nbeen talking illuminatingly about Spain, rose, bowed and left the table,\nleaving Dickson, who liked to linger over his meals, to the society of\nthe ichthyophagous student.\n\nHe nodded towards the book. \"Interesting?\" he asked.\n\nThe young man shook his head and displayed the name on the cover.\n\"Anatole France. I used to be crazy about him, but now he seems rather a\nback number.\" Then he glanced towards the just-vacated chair.\n\"Australian,\" he said.\n\n\"How d'you know?\"\n\n\"Can't mistake them. There's nothing else so lean and fine produced on\nthe globe to-day. I was next door to them at Pozi\u00c3\u00a8res and saw them\nfight. Lord! Such men! Now and then you had a freak, but most looked\nlike Phoebus Apollo.\"\n\nDickson gazed with a new respect at his neighbour, for he had not\nassociated him with battle-fields. During the war he had been a fervent\npatriot, but, though he had never heard a shot himself, so many of his\nfriends' sons and nephews, not to mention cousins of his own, had seen\nservice, that he had come to regard the experience as commonplace. Lions\nin Africa and bandits in Mexico seemed to him novel and romantic things,\nbut not trenches and airplanes which were the whole world's property.\nBut he could scarcely fit his neighbour into even his haziest picture of\nwar. The young man was tall and a little round-shouldered; he had\nshort-sighted, rather prominent brown eyes, untidy black hair and dark\neyebrows which came near to meeting. He wore a knickerbocker suit of\nbluish-grey tweed, a pale blue shirt, a pale blue collar and a dark blue\ntie--a symphony of colour which seemed too elaborately considered to be\nquite natural. Dickson had set him down as an artist or a newspaper\ncorrespondent, objects to him of lively interest. But now the\nclassification must be reconsidered.\n\n\"So you were in the war,\" he said encouragingly.\n\n\"Four blasted years,\" was the savage reply. \"And I never want to hear\nthe name of the beastly thing again.\"\n\n\"You said he was an Australian,\" said Dickson, casting back. \"But I\nthought Australians had a queer accent, like the English.\"\n\n\"They've all kind of accents, but you can never mistake their voice.\nIt's got the sun in it. Canadians have got grinding ice in theirs, and\nVirginians have got butter. So have the Irish. In Britain there are no\nvoices, only speaking tubes. It isn't safe to judge men by their accent\nonly. You yourself I take to be Scotch, but for all I know you may be a\nsenator from Chicago or a Boer General.\"\n\n\"I'm from Glasgow. My name's Dickson McCunn.\" He had a faint hope that\nthe announcement might affect the other as it had affected the bagman at\nKilchrist.\n\n\"Golly, what a name!\" exclaimed the young man rudely.\n\nDickson was nettled. \"It's very old Highland,\" he said. \"It means the\nson of a dog.\"\n\n\"Which--Christian name or surname?\" Then the young man appeared to think\nhe had gone too far, for he smiled pleasantly. \"And a very good name\ntoo. Mine is prosaic by comparison. They call me John Heritage.\"\n\n\"That,\" said Dickson, mollified, \"is like a name out of a book. With\nthat name by rights you should be a poet.\"\n\nGloom settled on the young man's countenance. \"It's a dashed sight too\npoetic. It's like Edwin Arnold and Alfred Austin and Dante Gabriel\nRossetti. Great poets have vulgar monosyllables for names, like Keats.\nThe new Shakespeare when he comes along will probably be called Grubb or\nJubber, if he isn't Jones. With a name like yours I might have a chance.\n_You_ should be the poet.\"\n\n\"I'm very fond of reading,\" said Dickson modestly.\n\nA slow smile crumpled Mr. Heritage's face. \"There's a fire in the\nsmoking-room,\" he observed as he rose. \"We'd better bag the armchairs\nbefore these fishing louts take them.\" Dickson followed obediently. This\nwas the kind of chance acquaintance for whom he had hoped, and he was\nprepared to make the most of him.\n\nThe fire burned bright in the little dusky smoking-room, lighted by one\noil-lamp. Mr. Heritage flung himself into a chair, stretched his long\nlegs and lit a pipe.\n\n\"You like reading?\" he asked. \"What sort? Any use for poetry?\"\n\n\"Plenty,\" said Dickson. \"I've aye been fond of learning it up and\nrepeating it to myself when I had nothing to do. In church and waiting\non trains, like. It used to be Tennyson, but now it's more Browning. I\ncan say a lot of Browning.\"\n\nThe other screwed his face into an expression of disgust. \"I know the\nstuff. 'Damask cheeks and dewy sister eyelids.' Or else the Ercles\nvein--'God's in His Heaven, all's right with the world.' No good, Mr.\nMcCunn. All back numbers. Poetry's not a thing of pretty round phrases\nor noisy invocations. It's life itself, with the tang of the raw world\nin it--not a sweetmeat for middle-class women in parlours.\"\n\n\"Are you a poet, Mr. Heritage?\"\n\n\"No, Dogson, I'm a paper-maker.\"\n\nThis was a new view to Mr. McCunn. \"I just once knew a paper-maker,\" he\nobserved reflectively. \"They called him Tosh. He drank a bit.\"\n\n\"Well, I don't drink,\" said the other. \"I'm a paper-maker, but that's\nfor my bread and butter. Some day for my own sake I may be a poet.\"\n\n\"Have you published anything?\"\n\nThe eager admiration in Dickson's tone gratified Mr. Heritage. He drew\nfrom his pocket a slim book. \"My firstfruits,\" he said, rather shyly.\n\nDickson received it with reverence. It was a small volume in grey paper\nboards with a white label on the back, and it was lettered:\n\"_Whorls--John Heritage's Book_.\" He turned the pages and read a little.\n\"It's a nice wee book,\" he observed at length.\n\n\"Good God, if you call it nice, I must have failed pretty badly,\" was\nthe irritated answer.\n\nDickson read more deeply and was puzzled. It seemed worse than the worst\nof Browning to understand. He found one poem about a garden entitled\n\"Revue.\" \"Crimson and resonant clangs the dawn,\" said the poet. Then he\nwent on to describe noonday:\n\n    \"Sunflowers, tall Grenadiers, ogle the roses' short-skirted ballet.\n     The fumes of dark sweet wine hidden in frail petals\n     Madden the drunkard bees.\"\n\nThis seemed to him an odd way to look at things, and he boggled over a\nphrase about an \"epicene lily.\" Then came evening: \"The painted gauze of\nthe stars flutters in a fold of twilight crape,\" sang Mr. Heritage; and\nagain, \"The moon's pale leprosy sloughs the fields.\"\n\nDickson turned to other verses which apparently enshrined the writer's\nmemory of the trenches. They were largely compounded of oaths, and\nrather horrible, lingering lovingly over sights and smells which every\none is aware of, but most people contrive to forget. He did not like\nthem. Finally he skimmed a poem about a lady who turned into a bird. The\nevolution was described with intimate anatomical details which scared\nthe honest reader.\n\nHe kept his eyes on the book for he did not know what to say. The trick\nseemed to be to describe nature in metaphors mostly drawn from\nmusic-halls and haberdashers' shops, and, when at a loss, to fall to\ncursing. He thought it frankly very bad, and he laboured to find words\nwhich would combine politeness and honesty.\n\n\"Well?\" said the poet.\n\n\"There's a lot of fine things here, but--but the lines don't just seem\nto scan very well.\"\n\nMr. Heritage laughed. \"Now I can place you exactly. You like the meek\nrhyme and the conventional epithet. Well, I don't. The world has passed\nbeyond that prettiness. You want the moon described as a Huntress or a\ngold disc or a flower--I say it's oftener like a beer barrel or a\ncheese. You want a wealth of jolly words and real things ruled out as\nunfit for poetry. I say there's nothing unfit for poetry. Nothing,\nDogson! Poetry's everywhere, and the real thing is commoner among drabs\nand pot-houses and rubbish heaps than in your Sunday parlours. The\npoet's business is to distil it out of rottenness, and show that it is\nall one spirit, the thing that keeps the stars in their place.... I\nwanted to call my book '_Drains_,' for drains are sheer poetry, carrying\noff the excess and discards of human life to make the fields green and\nthe corn ripen. But the publishers kicked. So I called it '_Whorls_,' to\nexpress my view of the exquisite involution of all things. Poetry is the\nfourth dimension of the soul.... Well, let's hear about your taste in\nprose.\"\n\nMr. McCunn was much bewildered, and a little inclined to be cross. He\ndisliked being called Dogson, which seemed to him an abuse of his\netymological confidences. But his habit of politeness held.\n\nHe explained rather haltingly his preferences in prose.\n\nMr. Heritage listened with wrinkled brows.\n\n\"You're even deeper in the mud than I thought,\" he remarked. \"You live\nin a world of painted laths and shadows. All this passion for the\npicturesque! Trash, my dear man, like a schoolgirl's novelette heroes.\nYou make up romances about gipsies and sailors and the blackguards they\ncall pioneers, but you know nothing about them. If you did, you would\nfind they had none of the gilt and gloss you imagine. But the great\nthings they have got in common with all humanity you ignore. It's\nlike--it's like sentimentalising about a pancake because it looked like\na buttercup, and all the while not knowing that it was good to eat.\"\n\nAt that moment the Australian entered the room to get a light for his\npipe. He wore a motor-cyclist's overalls and appeared to be about to\ntake the road. He bade them good night and it seemed to Dickson that his\nface, seen in the glow of the fire, was drawn and anxious, unlike that\nof the agreeable companion at dinner.\n\n\"There,\" said Mr. Heritage, nodding after the departing figure. \"I dare\nsay you have been telling yourself stories about that chap--life in the\nbush, stock-riding and the rest of it. But probably he's a bank-clerk\nfrom Melbourne.... Your romanticism is one vast self-delusion and it\nblinds your eye to the real thing. We have got to clear it out and with\nit all the damnable humbug of the Kelt.\"\n\nMr. McCunn, who spelt the word with a soft \"C,\" was puzzled. \"I thought\na kelt was a kind of a no-weel fish,\" he interposed.\n\nBut the other, in the flood-tide of his argument, ignored the\ninterruption. \"That's the value of the war,\" he went on. \"It has burst\nup all the old conventions, and we've got to finish the destruction\nbefore we can build. It is the same with literature and religion and\nsociety and politics. At them with the axe, say I. I have no use for\npriests and pedants. I've no use for upper classes and middle classes.\nThere's only one class that matters, the plain man, the workers, who\nlive close to life.\"\n\n\"The place for you,\" said Dickson dryly, \"is in Russia among the\nBolsheviks.\"\n\nMr. Heritage approved. \"They are doing a great work in their own\nfashion. We needn't imitate all their methods--they're a trifle crude\nand have too many Jews among them--but they've got hold of the right end\nof the stick. They seek truth and reality.\"\n\nMr. McCunn was slowly being roused.\n\n\"What brings you wandering hereaways?\" he asked.\n\n\"Exercise,\" was the answer. \"I've been kept pretty closely tied up all\nwinter. And I want leisure and quiet to think over things.\"\n\n\"Well, there's one subject you might turn your attention to. You'll have\nbeen educated like a gentleman?\"\n\n\"Nine wasted years--five at Harrow, four at Cambridge.\"\n\n\"See here, then. You're daft about the working-class and have no use for\nany other. But what in the name of goodness do you know about\nworking-men?... I come out of them myself, and have lived next door to\nthem all my days. Take them one way and another, they're a decent sort,\ngood and bad like the rest of us. But there's a wheen daft folk that\nwould set them up as models--close to truth and reality, says you. It's\nsheer ignorance, for you're about as well acquaint with the working-man\nas with King Solomon. You say I make up fine stories about tinklers and\nsailor-men because I know nothing about them. That's maybe true. But\nyou're at the same job yourself. You ideelise the working-man, you and\nyour kind, because you're ignorant. You say that he's seeking for truth,\nwhen he's only looking for a drink and a rise in wages. You tell me he's\nnear reality, but I tell you that his notion of reality is often just a\nshort working day and looking on at a footba'-match on Saturday.... And\nwhen you run down what you call the middle-classes that do\nthree-quarters of the world's work and keep the machine going and the\nworking man in a job, then I tell you you're talking havers. Havers!\"\n\nMr. McCunn, having delivered his defence of the bourgeoisie, rose\nabruptly and went to bed. He felt jarred and irritated. His innocent\nlittle private domain had been badly trampled by this stray bull of a\npoet. But as he lay in bed, before blowing out his candle, he had\nrecourse to Walton, and found a passage on which, as on a pillow, he\nwent peacefully to sleep:\n\n    \"As I left this place, and entered into the next field, a second\n    pleasure entertained me; 'twas a handsome milkmaid, that had not yet\n    attained so much age and wisdom as to load her mind with any fears\n    of many things that will never be, as too many men too often do; but\n    she cast away all care, and sang like a nightingale; her voice was\n    good, and the ditty fitted for it; it was the smooth song that was\n    made by _Kit Marlow_ now at least fifty years ago. And the\n    milkmaid's mother sung an answer to it, which was made by _Sir\n    Walter Raleigh_ in his younger days. They were old-fashioned poetry,\n    but choicely good; I think much better than the strong lines that\n    are now in fashion in this critical age.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nHOW CHILDE ROLAND AND ANOTHER CAME TO THE DARK TOWER\n\n\nDickson woke with a vague sense of irritation. As his recollections took\nform they produced a very unpleasant picture of Mr. John Heritage. The\npoet had loosened all his placid idols, so that they shook and rattled\nin the niches where they had been erstwhile so secure. Mr. McCunn had a\nmind of a singular candour, and was prepared most honestly at all times\nto revise his views. But by this iconoclast he had been only irritated\nand in no way convinced. \"_Sich_ poetry!\" he muttered to himself as he\nshivered in his bath (a daily cold tub instead of his customary hot one\non Saturday night being part of the discipline of his holiday). \"And yon\nblethers about the working-man!\" he ingeminated as he shaved. He\nbreakfasted alone, having outstripped even the fishermen, and as he ate\nhe arrived at conclusions. He had a great respect for youth, but a line\nmust be drawn somewhere. \"The man's a child,\" he decided, \"and not like\nto grow up. The way he's besotted on everything daftlike, if it's only\n_new_. And he's no rightly young either--speaks like an auld dominie,\nwhiles. And he's rather impident,\" he concluded, with memories of\n\"Dogson.\"... He was very clear that he never wanted to see him again;\nthat was the reason of his early breakfast. Having clarified his mind by\ndefinitions, Dickson felt comforted. He paid his bill, took an\naffectionate farewell of the landlord, and at 7.30 precisely stepped out\ninto the gleaming morning.\n\nIt was such a day as only a Scots April can show. The cobbled streets of\nKirkmichael still shone with the night's rain, but the storm clouds had\nfled before a mild south wind, and the whole circumference of the sky\nwas a delicate translucent blue. Homely breakfast smells came from the\nhouses and delighted Mr. McCunn's nostrils; a squalling child was a\npleasant reminder of an awakening world, the urban counterpart to the\nmorning song of birds; even the sanitary cart seemed a picturesque\nvehicle. He bought his ration of buns and ginger biscuits at a baker's\nshop whence various ragamuffin boys were preparing to distribute the\nhouseholders' bread, and took his way up the Gallows Hill to the Burgh\nMuir almost with regret at leaving so pleasant a habitation.\n\nA chronicle of ripe vintages must pass lightly over small beer. I will\nnot dwell on his leisurely progress in the bright weather, or on his\nluncheon in a coppice of young firs, or on his thoughts which had\nreturned to the idyllic. I take up the narrative at about three o'clock\nin the afternoon, when he is revealed seated on a milestone examining\nhis map. For he had come, all unwitting, to a turning of the ways, and\nhis choice is the cause of this veracious history.\n\nThe place was high up on a bare moor, which showed a white lodge among\npines, a white cottage in a green nook by a burnside, and no other marks\nof human dwelling. To his left, which was the east, the heather rose to\na low ridge of hill, much scarred with peat-bogs, behind which appeared\nthe blue shoulder of a considerable mountain. Before him the road was\nlost momentarily in the woods of a shooting-box, but reappeared at a\ngreat distance climbing a swell of upland which seemed to be the glacis\nof a jumble of bold summits. There was a pass there, the map told him,\nwhich led into Galloway. It was the road he had meant to follow, but as\nhe sat on the milestone his purpose wavered. For there seemed greater\nattractions in the country which lay to the westward. Mr. McCunn, be it\nremembered, was not in search of brown heath and shaggy wood; he wanted\ngreenery and the Spring.\n\nWestward there ran out a peninsula in the shape of an isosceles\ntriangle, of which his present highroad was the base. At a distance of a\nmile or so a railway ran parallel to the road, and he could see the\nsmoke of a goods train waiting at a tiny station islanded in acres of\nbog. Thence the moor swept down to meadows and scattered copses, above\nwhich hung a thin haze of smoke which betokened a village. Beyond it\nwere further woodlands, not firs but old shady trees, and as they\nnarrowed to a point the gleam of two tiny estuaries appeared on either\nside. He could not see the final cape, but he saw the sea beyond it,\nflawed with catspaws, gold in the afternoon sun, and on it a small\nherring smack flapping listless sails.\n\nSomething in the view caught and held his fancy. He conned his map, and\nmade out the names. The peninsula was called the Cruives--an old name\napparently, for it was in antique lettering. He vaguely remembered that\n\"cruives\" had something to do with fishing, doubtless in the two streams\nwhich flanked it. One he had already crossed, the Laver, a clear\ntumbling water springing from green hills; the other, the Garple,\ndescended from the rougher mountains to the south. The hidden village\nbore the name of Dalquharter, and the uncouth syllables awoke some vague\nrecollection in his mind. The great house in the trees beyond--it must\nbe a great house, for the map showed large policies--was Huntingtower.\n\nThe last name fascinated and almost decided him. He pictured an ancient\nkeep by the sea, defended by converging rivers, which some old Comyn\nlord of Galloway had built to command the shore road and from which he\nhad sallied to hunt in his wild hills.... He liked the way the moor\ndropped down to green meadows, and the mystery of the dark woods beyond.\nHe wanted to explore the twin waters, and see how they entered that\nstrange shimmering sea. The odd names, the odd cul-de-sac of a\npeninsula, powerfully attracted him. Why should he not spend a night\nthere, for the map showed clearly that Dalquharter had an inn? He must\ndecide promptly, for before him a side-road left the highway, and the\nsignpost bore the legend, \"Dalquharter and Huntingtower.\"\n\nMr. McCunn, being a cautious and pious man, took the omens. He tossed a\npenny--heads go on, tails turn aside. It fell tails.\n\nHe knew as soon as he had taken three steps down the side-road that he\nwas doing something momentous, and the exhilaration of enterprise stole\ninto his soul. It occurred to him that this was the kind of landscape\nthat he had always especially hankered after, and had made pictures of\nwhen he had a longing for the country on him--a wooded cape between\nstreams, with meadows inland and then a long lift of heather. He had the\nsame feeling of expectancy, of something most interesting and curious on\nthe eve of happening, that he had had long ago when he waited on the\ncurtain rising at his first play. His spirits soared like the lark, and\nhe took to singing. If only the inn at Dalquharter were snug and empty,\nthis was going to be a day in ten thousand. Thus mirthfully he swung\ndown the rough grass-grown road, past the railway, till he came to a\npoint where heath began to merge in pasture, and dry-stone walls split\nthe moor into fields. Suddenly his pace slackened and song died on his\nlips. For, approaching from the right by a tributary path, was the Poet.\n\nMr. Heritage saw him afar off and waved a friendly hand. In spite of his\nchagrin Dickson could not but confess that he had misjudged his critic.\nStriding with long steps over the heather, his jacket open to the wind,\nhis face a-glow and his capless head like a whin-bush for disorder, he\ncut a more wholesome and picturesque figure than in the smoking-room\nthe night before. He seemed to be in a companionable mood, for he\nbrandished his stick and shouted greetings.\n\n\"Well met!\" he cried; \"I was hoping to fall in with you again. You must\nhave thought me a pretty fair cub last night.\"\n\n\"I did that,\" was the dry answer.\n\n\"Well, I want to apologise. God knows what made me treat you to a\nuniversity-extension lecture. I may not agree with you, but every man's\nentitled to his own views, and it was dashed poor form for me to start\njawing you.\"\n\nMr. McCunn had no gift of nursing anger, and was very susceptible to\napologies.\n\n\"That's all right,\" he murmured. \"Don't mention it. I'm wondering what\nbrought you down here, for it's off the road.\"\n\n\"Caprice. Pure caprice. I liked the look of this butt-end of nowhere.\"\n\n\"Same here. I've aye thought there was something terrible nice about a\nwee cape with a village at the neck of it and a burn each side.\"\n\n\"Now that's interesting,\" said Mr. Heritage. \"You're obsessed by a\nparticular type of landscape. Ever read Freud?\"\n\nDickson shook his head.\n\n\"Well, you've got an odd complex somewhere. I wonder where the key lies.\nCape--woods--two rivers--moor behind. Ever been in love, Dogson?\"\n\nMr. McCunn was startled. \"Love\" was a word rarely mentioned in his\ncircle except on death-beds. \"I've been a married man for thirty years,\"\nhe said hurriedly.\n\n\"That won't do. It should have been a hopeless affair--the last sight of\nthe lady on a spur of coast with water on three sides--that kind of\nthing, you know. Or it might have happened to an ancestor.... But you\ndon't look the kind of breed for hopeless attachments. More likely some\nscoundrelly old Dogson long ago found sanctuary in this sort of place.\nDo you dream about it?\"\n\n\"Not exactly.\"\n\n\"Well, I do. The queer thing is that I've got the same prepossession as\nyou. As soon as I spotted this Cruives place on the map this morning, I\nsaw it was what I was after. When I came in sight of it I almost\nshouted. I don't very often dream, but when I do that's the place I\nfrequent. Odd, isn't it?\"\n\nMr. McCunn was deeply interested at this unexpected revelation of\nromance. \"Maybe it's being in love,\" he daringly observed.\n\nThe Poet demurred. \"No. I'm not a connoisseur of obvious sentiment. That\nexplanation might fit your case, but not mine. I'm pretty certain\nthere's something hideous at the back of _my_ complex--some grim old\nbusiness tucked away back in the ages. For though I'm attracted by the\nplace, I'm frightened too!\"\n\nThere seemed no room for fear in the delicate landscape now opening\nbefore them. In front in groves of birch and rowans smoked the first\nhouses of a tiny village. The road had become a green \"loaning\" on the\nample margin of which cattle grazed. The moorland still showed itself in\nspits of heather, and some distance off, where a rivulet ran in a\nhollow, there were signs of a fire and figures near it. These last Mr.\nHeritage regarded with disapproval.\n\n\"Some infernal trippers!\" he murmured. \"Or Boy Scouts. They desecrate\neverything. Why can't the _tunicatus popellus_ keep away from a paradise\nlike this!\" Dickson, a democrat who felt nothing incongruous in the\npresence of other holiday-makers, was meditating a sharp rejoinder, when\nMr. Heritage's tone changed.\n\n\"Ye gods! What a village!\" he cried, as they turned a corner. There were\nnot more than a dozen whitewashed houses, all set in little gardens of\nwallflower and daffodil and early fruit blossom. A triangle of green\nfilled the intervening space, and in it stood an ancient wooden pump.\nThere was no schoolhouse or kirk; not even a post-office--only a red box\nin a cottage side. Beyond rose the high wall and the dark trees of the\ndemesne, and to the right up a by-road which clung to the park edge\nstood a two-storeyed building which bore the legend \"The Cruives Inn.\"\n\nThe Poet became lyrical. \"At last!\" he cried. \"The village of my dreams!\nNot a sign of commerce! No church or school or beastly recreation hall!\nNothing but these divine little cottages and an ancient pub! Dogson, I\nwarn you, I'm going to have the devil of a tea.\" And he declaimed:\n\n             \"Thou shalt hear a song\n    After a while which Gods may listen to;\n    But place the flask upon the board and wait\n    Until the stranger hath allayed his thirst,\n    For poets, grasshoppers and nightingales\n    Sing cheerily but when the throat is moist.\"\n\nDickson, too, longed with sensual gusto for tea. But, as they drew\nnearer, the inn lost its hospitable look. The cobbles of the yard were\nweedy, as if rarely visited by traffic, a pane in a window was broken,\nand the blinds hung tattered. The garden was a wilderness, and the\ndoorstep had not been scoured for weeks. But the place had a landlord,\nfor he had seen them approach and was waiting at the door to meet them.\n\nHe was a big man in his shirt sleeves, wearing old riding breeches\nunbuttoned at the knees, and thick ploughman's boots. He had no\nleggings, and his fleshy calves were imperfectly covered with woollen\nsocks. His face was large and pale, his neck bulged, and he had a gross\nunshaven jowl. He was a type familiar to students of society; not the\ninnkeeper, which is a thing consistent with good breeding and all the\nrefinements; a type not unknown in the House of Lords, especially among\nrecent creations, common enough in the House of Commons and the City of\nLondon, and by no means infrequent in the governing circles of Labour;\nthe type known to the discerning as the Licensed Victualler.\n\nHis face was wrinkled in official smiles, and he gave the travellers a\nhearty good afternoon.\n\n\"Can we stop here for the night?\" Dickson asked.\n\nThe landlord looked sharply at him, and then replied to Mr. Heritage.\nHis expression passed from official bonhomie to official contrition.\n\n\"Impossible, gentlemen. Quite impossible.... Ye couldn't have come at a\nworse time. I've only been here a fortnight myself, and we haven't got\nright shaken down yet. Even then I might have made shift to do with ye,\nbut the fact is we've illness in the house, and I'm fair at my wits'\nend. It breaks my heart to turn gentlemen away and me that keen to get\nthe business started. But there it is!\" He spat vigorously as if to\nemphasise the desperation of his quandary.\n\nThe man was clearly Scots, but his native speech was overlaid with\nsomething alien, something which might have been acquired in America or\nin going down to the sea in ships. He hitched his breeches, too, with a\nnautical air.\n\n\"Is there nowhere else we can put up?\" Dickson asked.\n\n\"Not in this one-horse place. Just a wheen auld wives that packed\nthegether they haven't room for an extra hen. But it's grand weather,\nand it's not above seven miles to Auchenlochan. Say the word and I'll\nyoke the horse and drive ye there.\"\n\n\"Thank you. We prefer to walk,\" said Mr. Heritage. Dickson would have\ntarried to inquire after the illness in the house, but his companion\nhurried him off. Once he looked back, and saw the landlord still on the\ndoorstep gazing after them.\n\n\"That fellow's a swine,\" said Mr. Heritage sourly. \"I wouldn't trust my\nneck in his pothouse. Now, Dogson, I'm hanged if I'm going to leave this\nplace. We'll find a corner in the village somehow. Besides, I'm\ndetermined on tea.\"\n\nThe little street slept in the clear pure light of an early April\nevening. Blue shadows lay on the white road, and a delicate aroma of\ncooking tantalised hungry nostrils. The near meadows shone like pale\ngold against the dark lift of the moor. A light wind had begun to blow\nfrom the west and carried the faintest tang of salt. The village at that\nhour was pure Paradise, and Dickson was of the Poet's opinion. At all\ncosts they must spend the night there.\n\nThey selected a cottage whiter and neater than the others, which stood\nat a corner, where a narrow lane turned southward. Its thatched roof had\nbeen lately repaired, and starched curtains of a dazzling whiteness\ndecorated the small, closely-shut windows. Likewise it had a green door\nand a polished brass knocker.\n\nTacitly the duty of envoy was entrusted to Mr. McCunn. Leaving the other\nat the gate, he advanced up the little path lined with quartz stones,\nand politely but firmly dropped the brass knocker. He must have been\nobserved, for ere the noise had ceased the door opened, and an elderly\nwoman stood before him. She had a sharply-cut face, the rudiments of a\nbeard, big spectacles on her nose, and an old-fashioned lace cap on her\nsmooth white hair. A little grim she looked at first sight, because of\nher thin lips and Roman nose, but her mild curious eyes corrected the\nimpression and gave the envoy confidence.\n\n\"Good afternoon, mistress,\" he said, broadening his voice to something\nmore rustical than his normal Glasgow speech. \"Me and my friend are\npaying our first visit here, and we're terrible taken up with the place.\nWe would like to bide the night, but the inn is no' taking folk. Is\nthere any chance, think you, of a bed here?\"\n\n\"I'll no tell ye a lee,\" said the woman. \"There's twae guid beds in the\nloft. But I dinna tak' lodgers and I dinna want to be bothered wi' ye.\nI'm an auld wumman and no' as stoot as I was. Ye'd better try doun the\nstreet. Eppie Home micht tak' ye.\"\n\nDickson wore his most ingratiating smile. \"But, mistress, Eppie Home's\nhouse is no' yours. We've taken a tremendous fancy to this bit. Can you\nno' manage to put with us for the one night? We're quiet auld-fashioned\nfolk and we'll no' trouble you much. Just our tea and maybe an egg to\nit, and a bowl of porridge in the morning.\"\n\nThe woman seemed to relent. \"Whaur's your freend?\" she asked, peering\nover her spectacles towards the garden gate. The waiting Mr. Heritage,\nseeing her eyes moving in his direction, took off his cap with a brave\ngesture and advanced. \"Glorious weather, Madam,\" he declared.\n\n\"English,\" whispered Dickson to the woman, in explanation.\n\nShe examined the Poet's neat clothes and Mr. McCunn's homely garments,\nand apparently found them reassuring. \"Come in,\" she said shortly. \"I\nsee ye're wilfu' folk and I'll hae to dae my best for ye.\"\n\nA quarter of an hour later the two travellers, having been introduced to\ntwo spotless beds in the loft, and having washed luxuriously at the pump\nin the back yard, were seated in Mrs. Morran's kitchen before a meal\nwhich fulfilled their wildest dreams. She had been baking that morning,\nso there were white scones and barley scones, and oaten farles, and\nrusset pancakes. There were three boiled eggs for each of them; there\nwas a segment of an immense currant cake (\"a present from my guid\nbrither last Hogmanay\"); there was skim-milk cheese; there were several\nkinds of jam, and there was a pot of dark-gold heather honey. \"Try hinny\nand aitcake,\" said their hostess. \"My man used to say he never fund\nonything as guid in a' his days.\"\n\nPresently they heard her story. Her name was Morran, and she had been a\nwidow these ten years. Of her family her son was in South Africa, one\ndaughter a lady's maid in London, and the other married to a\nschoolmaster in Kyle. The son had been in France fighting, and had come\nsafely through. He had spent a month or two with her before his return,\nand, she feared, had found it dull. \"There's no' a man body in the\nplace. Naething but auld wives.\"\n\nThat was what the innkeeper had told them. Mr. McCunn inquired\nconcerning the inn.\n\n\"There's new folk just come. What's this they ca'\nthem?--Robson--Dobson--aye, Dobson. What for wad they no' tak' ye in?\nDoes the man think he's a laird to refuse folk that gait?\"\n\n\"He said he had illness in the house.\"\n\nMrs. Morran meditated. \"Whae in the world can be lyin' there? The man\nbides his lane. He got a lassie frae Auchenlochan to cook, but she and\nher box gaed off in the post-cairt yestreen. I doot he tell't ye a lee,\nthough it's no for me to juidge him. I've never spoken a word to ane o'\nthae new folk.\"\n\nDickson inquired about the \"new folk.\"\n\n\"They're a' new come in the last three weeks, and there's no' a man o'\nthe auld stock left. John Blackstocks at the Wast Lodge dee'd o'\npneumony last back-end, and auld Simon Tappie at the Gairdens flitted to\nMaybole a year come Mairtinmas. There's naebody at the Gairdens noo, but\nthere's a man come to the Wast Lodge, a blackavised body wi' a face like\nbend-leather. Tam Robison used to bide at the South Lodge, but Tam got\nkilled about Mesopotamy, and his wife took the bairns to her guidsire up\nat the Garpleheid. I seen the man that's in the South Lodge gaun up the\nstreet when I was finishin' my denner--a shilpit body and a lameter, but\nhe hirples as fast as ither folk run. He's no' bonny to look at. I canna\nthink what the factor's ettlin' at to let sic' ill-faured chiels come\nabout the toun.\"\n\nTheir hostess was rapidly rising in Dickson's esteem. She sat very\nstraight in her chair, eating with the careful gentility of a bird, and\nprimming her thin lips after every mouthful of tea.\n\n\"Who bides in the Big House?\" he asked. \"Huntingtower is the name, isn't\nit?\"\n\n\"When I was a lassie they ca'ed it Dalquharter Hoose, and Huntingtower\nwas the auld rickle o' stanes at the sea-end. But naething wad serve the\nlast laird's faither but he maun change the name, for he was clean daft\nabout what they ca' antickities. Ye speir whae bides in the Hoose?\nNaebody, since the young laird dee'd. It's standin' cauld and lanely and\nsteikit, and it aince the cheeriest dwallin' in a' Carrick.\"\n\nMrs. Morran's tone grew tragic. \"It's a queer warld wi'out the auld\ngentry. My faither and my guidsire and his faither afore him served the\nKennedys, and my man Dauvit Morran was gemkeeper to them, and afore I\nmairried I was ane o' the table-maids. They were kind folk, the\nKennedys, and, like a' the rale gentry, maist mindfu' o' them that\nserved them. Sic' merry nichts I've seen in the auld Hoose, at\nHallowe'en and Hogmanay, and at the servants' balls and the waddin's o'\nthe young leddies! But the laird bode to waste his siller in stane and\nlime, and hadna that much to leave to his bairns. And now they've a'\nscattered or deid.\"\n\nHer grave face wore the tenderness which comes from affectionate\nreminiscence.\n\n\"There was never sic a laddie as young Maister Quentin. No' a week gaed\nby but he was in here, cryin', 'Phemie Morran, I've come till my tea!'\nFine he likit my treacle scones, puir man. There wasna ane in the\ncountryside sae bauld a rider at the hunt, or sic a skeely fisher. And\nhe was clever at his books tae, a graund scholar, they said, and ettlin'\nat bein' what they ca' a dipplemat. But that's a' bye wi'.\"\n\n\"Quentin Kennedy--the fellow in the Tins?\" Heritage asked. \"I saw him in\nRome when he was with the Mission.\"\n\n\"I dinna ken. He was a brave sodger, but he wasna long fechtin' in\nFrance till he got a bullet in his breist. Syne we heard tell o' him in\nfar awa' bits like Russia; and syne cam' the end o' the war and we\nlookit to see him back, fishin' the waters and ridin' like Jehu as in\nthe auld days. But wae's me! It wasna permitted. The next news we got,\nthe puir laddie was deid o' influenzy and buried somewhere about France.\nThe wanchancy bullet maun have weakened his chest, nae doot. So that's\nthe end o' the guid stock o' Kennedy o' Huntingtower, whae hae been\ngreat folk sin' the time o' Robert Bruce. And noo the Hoose is shut up\ntill the lawyers can get somebody sae far left to himsel' as to tak' it\non lease, and in thae dear days it's no' just onybody that wants a\nmuckle castle.\"\n\n\"Who are the lawyers?\" Dickson asked.\n\n\"Glendonan and Speirs in Embro. But they never look near the place, and\nMaister Loudoun in Auchenlochan does the factorin'. He's let the public\nan' filled the twae lodges, and he'll be thinkin' nae doot that he's\ndone eneuch.\"\n\nMrs. Morran had poured some hot water into the big slop-bowl, and had\nbegun the operation known as \"synding out\" the cups. It was a hint that\nthe meal was over and Dickson and Heritage rose from the table. Followed\nby an injunction to be back for supper \"on the chap o' nine,\" they\nstrolled out into the evening. Two hours of some sort of daylight\nremained, and the travellers had that impulse to activity which comes to\nall men who, after a day of exercise and emptiness, are stayed with a\nsatisfying tea.\n\n\"You should be happy, Dogson,\" said the Poet. \"Here we have all the\nmaterials for your blessed romance--old mansion, extinct family, village\ndeserted of men and an innkeeper whom I suspect of being a villain. I\nfeel almost a convert to your nonsense myself. We'll have a look at the\nHouse.\"\n\nThey turned down the road which ran north by the park wall, past the inn\nwhich looked more abandoned than ever, till they came to an entrance\nwhich was clearly the West Lodge. It had once been a pretty, modish\ncottage, with a thatched roof and dormer windows, but now it was badly\nin need of repair. A window-pane was broken and stuffed with a sack, the\nposts of the porch were giving inwards, and the thatch was crumbling\nunder the attentions of a colony of starlings. The great iron gates were\nrusty, and on the coat of arms above them the gilding was patchy and\ntarnished.\n\nApparently the gates were locked, and even the side wicket failed to\nopen to Heritage's vigorous shaking. Inside a weedy drive disappeared\namong ragged rhododendrons.\n\nThe noise brought a man to the lodge door. He was a sturdy fellow in a\nsuit of black clothes which had not been made for him. He might have\nbeen a butler _en deshabille_, but for the presence of a pair of field\nboots into which he had tucked the ends of his trousers. The curious\nthing about him was his face, which was decorated with features so tiny\nas to give the impression of a monstrous child. Each in itself was well\nenough formed, but eyes, nose, mouth, chin were of a smallness curiously\nout of proportion to the head and body. Such an anomaly might have been\nredeemed by the expression; good-humour would have invested it with an\nair of agreeable farce. But there was no friendliness in the man's face.\nIt was set like a judge's in a stony impassiveness.\n\n\"May we walk up to the House?\" Heritage asked. \"We are here for a night\nand should like to have a look at it.\"\n\nThe man advanced a step. He had either a bad cold, or a voice comparable\nin size to his features.\n\n\"There's no entrance here,\" he said huskily. \"I have strict orders.\"\n\n\"Oh, come now,\" said Heritage. \"It can do nobody any harm if you let us\nin for half an hour.\"\n\nThe man advanced another step.\n\n\"You shall not come in. Go away from here. Go away, I tell you. It is\nprivate.\" The words spoken by the small mouth in the small voice had a\nkind of childish ferocity.\n\nThe travellers turned their back on him and continued their way.\n\n\"Sich a curmudgeon!\" Dickson commented. His face had flushed, for he was\nsusceptible to rudeness. \"Did you notice? That man's a foreigner.\"\n\n\"He's a brute,\" said Heritage. \"But I'm not going to be done in by that\nclass of lad. There can be no gates on the sea side, so we'll work round\nthat way, for I won't sleep till I've seen the place.\"\n\nPresently the trees grew thinner, and the road plunged through thickets\nof hazel till it came to a sudden stop in a field. There the cover\nceased wholly, and below them lay the glen of the Laver. Steep green\nbanks descended to a stream which swept in coils of gold into the eye of\nthe sunset. A little further down the channel broadened, the slopes fell\nback a little, and a tongue of glittering sea ran up to meet the hill\nwaters. The Laver is a gentle stream after it leaves its cradle heights,\na stream of clear pools and long bright shallows, winding by moorland\nsteadings and upland meadows; but in its last half-mile it goes mad, and\nimitates its childhood when it tumbled over granite shelves. Down in\nthat green place the crystal water gushed and frolicked as if determined\non one hour of rapturous life before joining the sedater sea.\n\nHeritage flung himself on the turf.\n\n\"This is a good place! Ye gods, what a good place! Dogson, aren't you\nglad you came? I think everything's bewitched to-night. That village is\nbewitched, and that old woman's tea. Good white magic! And that foul\ninnkeeper and that brigand at the gate. Black magic! And now here is the\nhome of all enchantment--'island valley of Avilion'--'waters that\nlisten for lovers'--all the rest of it!\"\n\nDickson observed and marvelled.\n\n\"I can't make you out, Mr. Heritage. You were saying last night you were\na great democrat, and yet you were objecting to yon laddies camping on\nthe moor. And you very near bit the neb off me when I said I liked\nTennyson. And now....\" Mr. McCunn's command of language was inadequate\nto describe the transformation.\n\n\"You're a precise, pragmatical Scot,\" was the answer. \"Hang it, man,\ndon't remind me that I'm inconsistent. I've a poet's licence to play the\nfool, and if you don't understand me, I don't in the least understand\nmyself. All I know is that I'm feeling young and jolly and that it's the\nSpring.\"\n\nMr. Heritage was assuredly in a strange mood. He began to whistle with a\nfar-away look in his eye.\n\n\"Do you know what that is?\" he asked suddenly.\n\nDickson, who could not detect any tune, said No.\n\n\"It's an _aria_ from a Russian opera that came out just before the war.\nI've forgotten the name of the fellow who wrote it. Jolly thing, isn't\nit? I always remind myself of it when I'm in this mood, for it is linked\nwith the greatest experience of my life. You said, I think, that you had\nnever been in love?\"\n\nDickson replied in the native fashion. \"Have you?\" he asked.\n\n\"I have, and I am--been for two years. I was down with my battalion on\nthe Italian front early in 1918, and because I could speak the language\nthey hoicked me out and sent me to Rome on a liaison job. It was Easter\ntime and fine weather and, being glad to get out of the trenches, I was\npretty well pleased with myself and enjoying life.... In the place where\nI stayed there was a girl. She was a Russian, a princess of a great\nfamily, but a refugee and of course as poor as sin.... I remember how\nbadly dressed she was among all the well-to-do Romans. But, my God, what\na beauty! There was never anything in the world like her.... She was\nlittle more than a child, and she used to sing that air in the morning\nas she went down the stairs.... They sent me back to the front before I\nhad a chance of getting to know her, but she used to give me little\ntimid good mornings, and her voice and eyes were like an angel's.... I'm\nover my head in love, but it's hopeless, quite hopeless. I shall never\nsee her again.\"\n\n\"I'm sure I'm honoured by your confidence,\" said Dickson reverently.\n\nThe Poet, who seemed to draw exhilaration from the memory of his\nsorrows, arose and fetched him a clout on the back. \"Don't talk of\nconfidence as if you were a reporter,\" he said. \"What about that House?\nIf we're to see it before the dark comes we'd better hustle.\"\n\nThe green slopes on their left, as they ran seaward, were clothed\ntowards their summit with a tangle of broom and light scrub. The two\nforced their way through this, and found to their surprise that on this\nside there were no defences of the Huntingtower demesne. Along the crest\nran a path which had once been gravelled and trimmed. Beyond through a\nthicket of laurels and rhododendrons they came on a long unkempt aisle\nof grass, which seemed to be one of those side avenues often found in\nconnection with old Scots dwellings. Keeping along this they reached a\ngrove of beech and holly through which showed a dim shape of masonry. By\na common impulse they moved stealthily, crouching in cover, till at the\nfar side of the wood they found a sunk fence and looked over an acre or\ntwo of what had once been lawn and flower-beds to the front of the\nmansion.\n\nThe outline of the building was clearly silhouetted against the glowing\nwest, but since they were looking at the east face the detail was all in\nshadow. But, dim as it was, the sight was enough to give Dickson the\nsurprise of his life. He had expected something old and baronial. But\nthis was new, raw and new, not twenty years built. Some madness had\nprompted its creator to set up a replica of a Tudor house in a\ncountryside where the thing was unheard of. All the tricks were\nthere--oriel windows, lozenged panes, high twisted chimney stacks; the\nvery stone was red, as if to imitate the mellow brick of some ancient\nKentish manor. It was new, but it was also decaying. The creepers had\nfallen from the walls, the pilasters on the terrace were tumbling down,\nlichen and moss were on the doorsteps. Shuttered, silent, abandoned, it\nstood like a harsh _memento mori_ of human hopes.\n\nDickson had never before been affected by an inanimate thing with so\nstrong a sense of disquiet. He had pictured an old stone tower on a\nbright headland; he found instead this raw thing among trees. The\ndecadence of the brand-new repels as something against nature, and this\nnew thing was decadent. But there was a mysterious life in it, for\nthough not a chimney smoked, it seemed to enshrine a personality and to\nwear a sinister _aura_. He felt a lively distaste, which was almost\nfear. He wanted to get far away from it as fast as possible. The sun,\nnow sinking very low, sent up rays which kindled the crests of a group\nof firs to the left of the front door. He had the absurd fancy that they\nwere torches flaming before a bier.\n\nIt was well that the two had moved quietly and kept in shadow. Footsteps\nfell on their ears, on the path which threaded the lawn just beyond the\nsunk-fence. It was the keeper of the West Lodge and he carried something\non his back, but both that and his face were indistinct in the\nhalf-light.\n\nOther footsteps were heard, coming from the other side of the lawn. A\nman's shod feet rang on the stone of a flagged path, and from their\nirregular fall it was plain that he was lame. The two men met near the\ndoor, and spoke together. Then they separated, and moved one down each\nside of the house. To the two watchers they had the air of a patrol, or\nof warders pacing the corridors of a prison.\n\n\"Let's get out of this,\" said Dickson, and turned to go.\n\nThe air had the curious stillness which precedes the moment of sunset,\nwhen the birds of day have stopped their noises and the sounds of night\nhave not begun. But suddenly in the silence fell notes of music. They\nseemed to come from the house, a voice singing softly but with great\nbeauty and clearness.\n\nDickson halted in his steps. The tune, whatever it was, was like a fresh\nwind to blow aside his depression. The house no longer looked\nsepulchral. He saw that the two men had hurried back from their patrol,\nhad met and exchanged some message, and made off again as if alarmed by\nthe music. Then he noticed his companion....\n\nHeritage was on one knee with his face rapt and listening. He got to his\nfeet and appeared to be about to make for the House. Dickson caught him\nby the arm and dragged him into the bushes, and he followed\nunresistingly, like a man in a dream. They ploughed through the thicket,\nrecrossed the grass avenue, and scrambled down the hillside to the banks\nof the stream.\n\nThen for the first time Dickson observed that his companion's face was\nvery white, and that sweat stood on his temples. Heritage lay down and\nlapped up water like a dog. Then he turned a wild eye on the other.\n\n\"I am going back,\" he said. \"That is the voice of the girl I saw in\nRome, and it is singing her song!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nDOUGAL\n\n\n\"You'll do nothing of the kind,\" said Dickson. \"You're coming home to\nyour supper. It was to be on the chap of nine.\"\n\n\"I'm going back to that place.\"\n\nThe man was clearly demented and must be humoured. \"Well, you must wait\ntill the morn's morning. It's very near dark now, and those are two ugly\ncustomers wandering about yonder. You'd better sleep the night on it.\"\n\nMr. Heritage seemed to be persuaded. He suffered himself to be led up\nthe now dusky slopes to the gate where the road from the village ended.\nHe walked listlessly like a man engaged in painful reflection. Once only\nhe broke the silence.\n\n\"You heard the singing?\" he asked.\n\nDickson was a very poor hand at a lie. \"I heard something,\" he admitted.\n\n\"You heard a girl's voice singing?\"\n\n\"It sounded like that,\" was the admission. \"But I'm thinking it might\nhave been a seagull.\"\n\n\"You're a fool,\" said the Poet rudely.\n\nThe return was a melancholy business, compared to the bright speed of\nthe outward journey. Dickson's mind was a chaos of feelings, all of them\nunpleasant. He had run up against something which he violently, blindly\ndetested, and the trouble was that he could not tell why. It was all\nperfectly absurd, for why on earth should an ugly house, some overgrown\ntrees and a couple of ill-favoured servants so malignly affect him? Yet\nthis was the fact; he had strayed out of Arcady into a sphere that\nfilled him with revolt and a nameless fear. Never in his experience had\nhe felt like this, this foolish childish panic which took all the colour\nand zest out of life. He tried to laugh at himself but failed. Heritage,\nstumbling alone by his side, effectually crushed his effort to discover\nhumour in the situation. Some exhalation from that infernal place had\ndriven the Poet mad. And then that voice singing! A seagull, he had\nsaid. More like a nightingale, he reflected--a bird which in the flesh\nhe had never met.\n\nMrs. Morran had the lamp lit and a fire burning in her cheerful kitchen.\nThe sight of it somewhat restored Dickson's equanimity, and to his\nsurprise he found that he had an appetite for supper. There was new\nmilk, thick with cream, and most of the dainties which had appeared at\ntea, supplemented by a noble dish of shimmering \"potted-head.\" The\nhostess did not share their meal, being engaged in some duties in the\nlittle cubby-hole known as the back kitchen.\n\nHeritage drank a glass of milk but would not touch food.\n\n\"I called this place Paradise four hours ago,\" he said. \"So it is, but I\nfancy it is next door to Hell. There is something devilish going on\ninside that park wall and I mean to get to the bottom of it.\"\n\n\"Hoots! Nonsense!\" Dickson replied with affected cheerfulness.\n\"To-morrow you and me will take the road for Auchenlochan. We needn't\ntrouble ourselves about an ugly old house and a wheen impident\nlodge-keepers.\"\n\n\"To-morrow I'm going to get inside the place. Don't come unless you\nlike, but it's no use arguing with me. My mind is made up.\"\n\nHeritage cleared a space on the table and spread out a section of a\nlarge-scale Ordnance map.\n\n\"I must clear my head about the topography, the same as if this were a\nbattle-ground. Look here, Dogson.... The road past the inn that we went\nby to-night runs north and south.\" He tore a page from a note-book and\nproceeded to make a rough sketch.[1]... \"One end we know abuts on the\nLaver glen, and the other stops at the South Lodge. Inside the wall\nwhich follows the road is a long belt of plantation--mostly beeches and\nash--then to the west a kind of park, and beyond that the lawns of the\nhouse. Strips of plantation with avenues between follow the north and\nsouth sides of the park. On the sea side of the House are the stables\nand what looks like a walled garden, and beyond them what seems to be\nopen ground with an old dovecot marked and the ruins of Huntingtower\nkeep. Beyond that there is more open ground, till you come to the cliffs\nof the cape. Have you got that?... It looks possible from the contouring\nto get on to the sea cliffs by following the Laver, for all that side\nis broken up into ravines.... But look at the other side--the Garple\nglen. It's evidently a deep-cut gully, and at the bottom it opens out\ninto a little harbour. There's deep water there, you observe. Now the\nHouse on the south side--the Garple side--is built fairly close to the\nedge of the cliffs. Is that all clear in your head? We can't reconnoitre\nunless we've got a working notion of the lie of the land.\"\n\n[Footnote 1: The reader is referred to the improved version of Mr.\nHeritage's sketch reproduced as a frontispiece.]\n\nDickson was about to protest that he had no intention of reconnoitring,\nwhen a hubbub arose in the back kitchen. Mrs. Morran's voice was heard\nin shrill protest.\n\n\"Ye ill laddie! Eh--ye--ill--laddie! [_crescendo_] Makin' a hash o' my\nback door wi' your dirty feet! What are ye slinkin' roond here for, when\nI tell't ye this mornin' that I wad sell ye nae mair scones till ye paid\nfor the last lot? Ye're a wheen thievin' hungry callants, and if there\nwere a polisman in the place I'd gie ye in chairge.... What's that ye\nsay? Ye're no' wantin' meat? Ye want to speak to the gentlemen that's\nbidin' here? Ye ken the auld ane, says you? I believe it's a muckle lee,\nbut there's the gentlemen to answer ye theirsels.\"\n\nMrs. Morran, brandishing a dishclout dramatically, flung open the door,\nand with a vigorous push propelled into the kitchen a singular figure.\n\nIt was a stunted boy, who from his face might have been fifteen years\nold, but had the stature of a child of twelve. He had a thatch of fiery\nred hair above a pale freckled countenance. His nose was snub, his eyes\na sulky grey-green, and his wide mouth disclosed large and damaged\nteeth. But remarkable as was his visage, his clothing was still\nstranger. On his head was the regulation Boy Scout hat, but it was\nseveral sizes too big, and was squashed down upon his immense red ears.\nHe wore a very ancient khaki shirt, which had once belonged to a\nfull-grown soldier, and the spacious sleeves were rolled up at the\nshoulders and tied with string, revealing a pair of skinny arms. Round\nhis middle hung what was meant to be a kilt--a kilt of home manufacture,\nwhich may once have been a tablecloth, for its bold pattern suggested no\nknown clan tartan. He had a massive belt, in which was stuck a broken\ngully-knife, and round his neck was knotted the remnant of what had once\nbeen a silk bandana. His legs and feet were bare, blue, scratched, and\nvery dirty, and his toes had the prehensile look common to monkeys and\nsmall boys who summer and winter go bootless. In his hand was a long\nash-pole, new cut from some coppice.\n\nThe apparition stood glum and lowering on the kitchen floor. As Dickson\nstared at it he recalled Mearns Street and the band of irregular Boy\nScouts who paraded to the roll of tin cans. Before him stood Dougal,\nChieftain of the Gorbals Die-Hards. Suddenly he remembered the\nphilanthropic Mackintosh, and his own subscription of ten pounds to the\ncamp fund. It pleased him to find the rascals here, for in the\nunpleasant affairs on the verge of which he felt himself they were a\ncomforting reminder of the peace of home.\n\n\"I'm glad to see you, Dougal,\" he said pleasantly. \"How are you all\ngetting on?\" And then, with a vague reminiscence of the Scouts'\ncode--\"Have you been minding to perform a good deed every day?\"\n\nThe Chieftain's brow darkened.\n\n\"'_Good deeds!_'\" he repeated bitterly. \"I tell ye I'm fair wore out wi'\ngood deeds. Yon man Mackintosh tell't me this was going to be a grand\nholiday. Holiday! Govey Dick! It's been like a Setterday night in Main\nStreet--a' fechtin', fechtin'.\"\n\nNo collocation of letters could reproduce Dougal's accent, and I will\nnot attempt it. There was a touch of Irish in it, a spice of music-hall\npatter, as well as the odd lilt of the Glasgow vernacular. He was strong\nin vowels, but the consonants, especially the letter \"t,\" were only\naspirations.\n\n\"Sit down and let's hear about things,\" said Dickson.\n\nThe boy turned his head to the still open back door, where Mrs. Morran\ncould be heard at her labours. He stepped across and shut it. \"I'm no'\nwantin' that auld wife to hear,\" he said. Then he squatted down on the\npatchwork rug by the hearth, and warmed his blue-black shins. Looking\ninto the glow of the fire, he observed, \"I seen you two up by the Big\nHoose the night.\"\n\n\"The devil you did,\" said Heritage, roused to a sudden attention. \"And\nwhere were you?\"\n\n\"Seven feet from your head, up a tree. It's my chief hidy-hole, and\nGosh! I need one, for Lean's after me wi' a gun. He got a shot at me\ntwo days syne.\"\n\nDickson exclaimed, and Dougal with morose pride showed a rent in his\nkilt. \"If I had had on breeks, he'd ha' got me.\"\n\n\"Who's Lean?\" Heritage asked.\n\n\"The man wi' the black coat. The other--the lame one--they ca' Spittal.\"\n\n\"How d'you know?\"\n\n\"I've listened to them crackin' thegither.\"\n\n\"But what for did the man want to shoot at you?\" asked the scandalised\nDickson.\n\n\"What for? Because they're frightened to death o' onybody going near\ntheir auld Hoose. They're a pair of deevils, worse nor any Red Indian,\nbut for a' that they're sweatin' wi' fright. What for? says you. Because\nthey're hidin' a Secret. I knew it as soon as I seen the man Lean's\nface. I once seen the same kind o' scoondrel at the Picters. When he\nopened his mouth to swear, I kenned he was a foreigner, like the lads\ndown at the Broomielaw. That looked black, but I hadn't got at the worst\nof it. Then he loosed off at me wi' his gun.\"\n\n\"Were you not feared?\" said Dickson.\n\n\"Ay, I was feared. But ye'll no' choke off the Gorbals Die-Hards wi' a\ngun. We held a meetin' round the camp fire, and we resolved to get to\nthe bottom o' the business. Me bein' their Chief, it was my duty to make\nwhat they ca' a reckonissince, for that was the dangerous job. So a'\nthis day I've been going on my belly about thae policies. I've found\nout some queer things.\"\n\nHeritage had risen and was staring down at the small squatting figure.\n\n\"What have you found out? Quick. Tell me at once.\" His voice was sharp\nand excited.\n\n\"Bide a wee,\" said the unwinking Dougal. \"I'm no' going to let ye into\nthis business till I ken that ye'll help. It's a far bigger job than I\nthought. There's more in it than Lean and Spittal. There's the big man\nthat keeps the public--Dobson, they ca' him. He's a Namerican, which\nlooks bad. And there's two-three tinklers campin' down in the Garple\nDean. They're in it, for Dobson was colloguin' wi' them a' mornin'. When\nI seen ye, I thought ye were more o' the gang, till I mindit that one o'\nye was auld McCunn that has the shop in Mearns Street. I seen that ye\ndidn't like the look o' Lean, and I followed ye here, for I was thinkin'\nI needit help.\"\n\nHeritage plucked Dougal by the shoulder and lifted him to his feet.\n\n\"For God's sake, boy,\" he cried, \"tell us what you know!\"\n\n\"Will ye help?\"\n\n\"Of course, you little fool.\"\n\n\"Then swear,\" said the ritualist. From a grimy wallet he extracted a\nlimp little volume which proved to be a damaged copy of a work entitled\n_Sacred Songs and Solos_. \"Here! Take that in your right hand and put\nyour left hand on my pole, and say after me, 'I swear no' to blab what\nis telled me in secret and to be swift and sure in obeyin' orders,\ns'help me God!' Syne kiss the bookie.\"\n\nDickson at first refused, declaring it was all havers, but Heritage's\ndocility persuaded him to follow suit. The two were sworn.\n\n\"Now,\" said Heritage.\n\nDougal squatted again on the hearth-rug, and gathered the eyes of his\naudience. He was enjoying himself.\n\n\"This day,\" he said slowly, \"I got inside the Hoose.\"\n\n\"Stout fellow,\" said Heritage; \"and what did you find there?\"\n\n\"I got inside that Hoose, but it wasn't once or twice I tried. I found a\ncorner where I was out o' sight o' anybody unless they had come there\nseekin' me, and I sklimmed up a rone pipe, but a' the windies were\nlockit and I verra near broke my neck. Syne I tried the roof, and a sore\nsklim I had, but when I got there there were no skylights. At the end I\ngot in by the coal-hole. That's why ye're maybe thinkin' I'm no' very\nclean.\"\n\nHeritage's patience was nearly exhausted.\n\n\"I don't want to hear how you got in. What did you find, you little\ndevil?\"\n\n\"Inside the Hoose,\" said Dougal slowly (and there was a melancholy sense\nof anti-climax in his voice, as of one who had hoped to speak of gold\nand jewels and armed men)--\"inside that Hoose there's nothing but two\nwomen.\"\n\nHeritage sat down before him with a stern face.\n\n\"Describe them,\" he commanded.\n\n\"One o' them is dead auld, as auld as the wife here. She didn't look to\nme very right in the head.\"\n\n\"And the other?\"\n\n\"Oh, just a lassie.\"\n\n\"What was she like?\"\n\nDougal seemed to be searching for adequate words. \"She is ...\" he began.\nThen a popular song gave him inspiration. \"She's pure as the lully in\nthe dell!\"\n\nIn no way discomposed by Heritage's fierce interrogatory air, he\ncontinued: \"She's either foreign or English, for she couldn't understand\nwhat I said, and I could make nothing o' her clippit tongue. But I could\nsee she had been greetin'. She looked feared, yet kind o' determined. I\nspeired if I could do anything for her, and when she got my meaning she\nwas terrible anxious to ken if I had seen a man--a big man, she said,\nwi' a yellow beard. She didn't seem to ken his name, or else she\nwouldn't tell me. The auld wife was mortal feared, and was aye speakin'\nin a foreign langwidge. I seen at once that what frightened them was\nLean and his friends, and I was just starting to speir about them when\nthere came a sound like a man walkin' along the passage. She was for\nhidin' me in behind a sofy, but I wasn't going to be trapped like that,\nso I got out by the other door and down the kitchen stairs and into the\ncoal-hole. Gosh, it was a near thing!\"\n\nThe boy was on his feet. \"I must be off to the camp to give out the\norders for the morn. I'm going back to that Hoose, for it's a fight\natween the Gorbals Die-Hards and the scoundrels that are frightenin'\nthae women. The question is, Are ye comin' with me? Mind, ye've sworn.\nBut if ye're no', I'm going mysel', though I'll no' deny I'd be glad o'\ncompany. _You_ anyway----\" he added, nodding at Heritage. \"Maybe auld\nMcCunn wouldn't get through the coal-hole.\"\n\n\"You're an impident laddie,\" said the outraged Dickson. \"It's no' likely\nwe're coming with you. Breaking into other folks' houses! It's a job for\nthe police!\"\n\n\"Please yersel',\" said the Chieftain and looked at Heritage.\n\n\"I'm on,\" said that gentleman.\n\n\"Well, just you set out the morn as if ye were for a walk up the Garple\nglen. I'll be on the road and I'll have orders for ye.\"\n\nWithout more ado Dougal left by way of the back kitchen. There was a\nbrief denunciation from Mrs. Morran, then the outer door banged and he\nwas gone.\n\nThe Poet sat still with his head in his hands, while Dickson, acutely\nuneasy, prowled about the floor. He had forgotten even to light his\npipe.\n\n\"You'll not be thinking of heeding that ragamuffin boy,\" he ventured.\n\n\"I'm certainly going to get into the House to-morrow,\" Heritage\nanswered, \"and if he can show me a way so much the better. He's a\nspirited youth. Do you breed many like him in Glasgow?\"\n\n\"Plenty,\" said Dickson sourly. \"See here, Mr. Heritage. You can't\nexpect me to be going about burgling houses on the word of a blagyird\nladdie. I'm a respectable man--aye been. Besides, I'm here for a\nholiday, and I've no call to be mixing myself up in strangers' affairs.\"\n\n\"You haven't. Only, you see, I think there's a friend of mine in that\nplace, and anyhow there are women in trouble. If you like, we'll say\ngood-bye after breakfast, and you can continue as if you had never\nturned aside to this damned peninsula. But I've got to stay.\"\n\nDickson groaned. What had become of his dream of idylls, his gentle\nbookish romance? Vanished before a reality which smacked horribly of\ncrude melodrama and possibly of sordid crime. His gorge rose at the\npicture, but a thought troubled him. Perhaps all romance in its hour of\nhappening was rough and ugly like this, and only shone rosy in the\nretrospect. Was he being false to his deepest faith?\n\n\"Let's have Mrs. Morran in,\" he ventured. \"She's a wise old body and I'd\nlike to hear her opinion of this business. We'll get common sense from\nher.\"\n\n\"I don't object,\" said Heritage. \"But no amount of common sense will\nchange my mind.\"\n\nTheir hostess forestalled them by returning at that moment to the\nkitchen.\n\n\"We want your advice, mistress,\" Dickson told her, and accordingly, like\na barrister with a client, she seated herself carefully in the big easy\nchair, found and adjusted her spectacles, and waited with hands folded\non her lap to hear the business. Dickson narrated their pre-supper\ndoings, and gave a sketch of Dougal's evidence. His exposition was\ncautious and colourless, and without conviction. He seemed to expect a\nrobust incredulity in his hearer.\n\nMrs. Morran listened with the gravity of one in church. When Dickson\nfinished she seemed to meditate.\n\n\"There's no blagyird trick that would surprise me in thae new folk.\nWhat's that ye ca' them--Lean and Spittal? Eppie Home threepit to me\nthey were furriners and these are no furrin names.\"\n\n\"What I want to hear from you, Mrs. Morran,\" said Dickson impressively,\n\"is whether you think there's anything in that boy's story?\"\n\n\"I think it's maist likely true. He's a terrible impident callant, but\nhe's no' a leear.\"\n\n\"Then you think that a gang of ruffians have got two lone women shut up\nin that House for their own purposes?\"\n\n\"I wadna wonder.\"\n\n\"But it's ridiculous! This is a Christian and law-abiding country. What\nwould the police say?\"\n\n\"They never troubled Dalquharter muckle. There's no' a polisman nearer\nthan Knockraw--yin Johnnie Trummle, and he's as useless as a frostit\ntattie.\"\n\n\"The wiselike thing, as I think,\" said Dickson, \"would be to turn the\nProcurator-Fiscal on to the job. It's his business, no' ours.\"\n\n\"Weel, I wadna say but ye're richt,\" said the lady.\n\n\"What would you do if you were us?\" Dickson's tone was subtly\nconfidential. \"My friend here wants to get into the House the morn with\nthat red-haired laddie to satisfy himself about the facts. I say no. Let\nsleeping dogs lie, I say, and if you think the beasts are mad report to\nthe authorities. What would you do yourself?\"\n\n\"If I were you,\" came the emphatic reply, \"I would tak' the first train\nhame the morn, and when I got hame I wad bide there. Ye're a dacent\nbody, but ye're no' the kind to be traivellin' the roads.\"\n\n\"And if you were me?\" Heritage asked with his queer crooked smile.\n\n\"If I was a young and yauld like you I wad gang into the Hoose, and I\nwadna rest till I had riddled oot the truith and jyled every scoondrel\nabout the place. If ye dinna gang, 'faith I'll kilt my coats and gang\nmysel'. I havena served the Kennedys for forty year no' to hae the\nhonour o' the Hoose at my hert.... Ye speired my advice, sirs, and ye've\ngotten it. Now I maun clear awa' your supper.\"\n\nDickson asked for a candle, and, as on the previous night, went abruptly\nto bed. The oracle of prudence to which he had appealed had betrayed him\nand counselled folly. But was it folly? For him, assuredly, for Dickson\nMcCunn, late of Mearns Street, Glasgow, wholesale and retail provision\nmerchant, elder in the Guthrie Memorial Kirk, and fifty-five years of\nage. Ay, that was the rub. He was getting old. The woman had seen it and\nhad advised him to go home. Yet the plea was curiously irksome, though\nit gave him the excuse he needed. If you played at being young, you had\nto take up the obligations of youth, and he thought derisively of his\nboyish exhilaration of the past days. Derisively, but also sadly. What\nhad become of that innocent joviality he had dreamed of, that happy\nmorning pilgrimage of Spring enlivened by tags from the poets? His\ngoddess had played him false. Romance had put upon him too hard a trial.\n\nHe lay long awake, torn between common sense and a desire to be loyal to\nsome vague whimsical standard. Heritage a yard distant appeared also to\nbe sleepless, for the bed creaked with his turning. Dickson found\nhimself envying one whose troubles, whatever they might be, were not\nthose of a divided mind.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nOF THE PRINCESS IN THE TOWER\n\n\nVery early next morning, while Mrs. Morran was still cooking breakfast,\nDickson and Heritage might have been observed taking the air in the\nvillage street. It was the Poet who had insisted upon this walk, and he\nhad his own purpose. They looked at the spires of smoke piercing the\nwindless air, and studied the daffodils in the cottage gardens. Dickson\nwas glum, but Heritage seemed in high spirits. He varied his garrulity\nwith spells of cheerful whistling.\n\nThey strode along the road by the park wall till they reached the inn.\nThere Heritage's music waxed peculiarly loud. Presently from the yard,\nunshaven and looking as if he had slept in his clothes, came Dobson the\ninnkeeper.\n\n\"Good morning,\" said the Poet. \"I hope the sickness in your house is on\nthe mend?\"\n\n\"Thank ye, it's no worse,\" was the reply, but in the man's heavy face\nthere was little civility. His small grey eyes searched their faces.\n\n\"We're just waiting on breakfast to get on the road again. I'm jolly\nglad we spent the night here. We found quarters after all, you know.\"\n\n\"So I see. Whereabouts, may I ask?\"\n\n\"Mrs. Morran's. We could always have got in there, but we didn't want\nto fuss an old lady, so we thought we'd try the inn first. She's my\nfriend's aunt.\"\n\nAt this amazing falsehood Dickson started, and the man observed his\nsurprise. The eyes were turned on him like a searchlight. They roused\nantagonism in his peaceful soul, and with that antagonism came an\nimpulse to back up the Poet. \"Ay,\" he said, \"she's my Auntie Phemie, my\nmother's half-sister.\"\n\nThe man turned on Heritage.\n\n\"Where are ye for the day?\"\n\n\"Auchenlochan,\" said Dickson hastily. He was still determined to shake\nthe dust of Dalquharter from his feet.\n\nThe innkeeper sensibly brightened. \"Well, ye'll have a fine walk. I must\ngo in and see about my own breakfast. Good day to ye, gentlemen.\"\n\n\"That,\" said Heritage as they entered the village street again, \"is the\nfirst step in camouflage, to put the enemy off his guard.\"\n\n\"It was an abominable lie,\" said Dickson crossly.\n\n\"Not at all. It was a necessary and proper _ruse de guerre_. It\nexplained why we spent the night here, and now Dobson and his friends\ncan get about their day's work with an easy mind. Their suspicions are\ntemporarily allayed, and that will make our job easier.\"\n\n\"I'm not coming with you.\"\n\n\"I never said you were. By 'we' I refer to myself and the red-headed\nboy.\"\n\n\"Mistress, you're my auntie,\" Dickson informed Mrs. Morran as she set\nthe porridge on the table. \"This gentleman has just been telling the man\nat the inn that you're my Auntie Phemie.\"\n\nFor a second their hostess looked bewildered. Then the corners of her\nprim mouth moved upwards in a slow smile.\n\n\"I see,\" she said. \"Weel, maybe it was weel done. But if ye're my nevoy\nye'll hae to keep up my credit, for we're a bauld and siccar lot.\"\n\nHalf an hour later there was a furious dissension when Dickson attempted\nto pay for the night's entertainment. Mrs. Morran would have none of it.\n\"Ye're no' awa' yet,\" she said tartly, and the matter was complicated by\nHeritage's refusal to take part in the debate. He stood aside and\ngrinned, till Dickson in despair returned his note-case to his pocket,\nmurmuring darkly that \"he would send it from Glasgow.\"\n\nThe road to Auchenlochan left the main village street at right angles by\nthe side of Mrs. Morran's cottage. It was a better road than that which\nthey had come yesterday, for by it twice daily the post-cart travelled\nto the post-town. It ran on the edge of the moor and on the lip of the\nGarple glen, till it crossed that stream and, keeping near the coast,\nemerged after five miles into the cultivated flats of the Lochan valley.\nThe morning was fine, the keen air invited to high spirits, plovers\npiped entrancingly over the bent and linnets sang in the whins, there\nwas a solid breakfast behind him, and the promise of a cheerful road\ntill luncheon. The stage was set for good humour, but Dickson's heart,\nwhich should have been ascending with the larks, stuck leadenly in his\nboots. He was not even relieved at putting Dalquharter behind him. The\natmosphere of that unhallowed place lay still on his soul. He hated it,\nbut he hated himself more. Here was one, who had hugged himself all his\ndays as an adventurer waiting his chance, running away at the first\nchallenge of adventure; a lover of Romance who fled from the earliest\noverture of his goddess. He was ashamed and angry, but what else was\nthere to do? Burglary in the company of a queer poet and a queerer\nurchin? It was unthinkable.\n\nPresently as they tramped silently on they came to the bridge beneath\nwhich the peaty waters of the Garple ran in porter-coloured pools and\ntawny cascades. From a clump of elders on the other side Dougal emerged.\nA barefoot boy, dressed in much the same parody of a Boy Scout's\nuniform, but with corduroy shorts instead of a kilt, stood before him at\nrigid attention. Some command was issued, the child saluted, and trotted\nback past the travellers with never a look at them. Discipline was\nstrong among the Gorbals Die-Hards; no Chief of Staff ever conversed\nwith his General under a stricter etiquette.\n\nDougal received the travellers with the condescension of a regular\ntowards civilians.\n\n\"They're off their gawrd,\" he announced. \"Thomas Yownie has been\nshadowin' them since skreigh o' day, and he reports that Dobson and Lean\nfollowed ye till ye were out o' sight o' the houses, and syne Lean got a\nspy-glass and watched ye till the road turned in among the trees. That\nsatisfied them, and they're both away back to their jobs. Thomas\nYownie's the fell yin. Ye'll no fickle Thomas Yownie.\"\n\nDougal extricated from his pouch the fag of a cigarette, lit it and\npuffed meditatively. \"I did a reckonissince mysel' this morning. I was\nup at the Hoose afore it was light, and tried the door o' the coal-hole.\nI doot they've gotten on our tracks, for it was lockit--ay, and wedged\nfrom the inside.\"\n\nDickson brightened. Was the insane venture off?\n\n\"For a wee bit I was fair beat. But I mindit that the lassie was allowed\nto walk in a kind o' a glass hoose on the side farthest away from the\nGarple. That was where she was singin' yest'reen. So I reckonissinced in\nthat direction, and I fund a queer place.\" _Sacred Songs and Solos_ was\nrequisitioned, and on a page of it Dougal proceeded to make marks with\nthe stump of a carpenter's pencil. \"See here,\" he commanded. \"There's\nthe glass place wi' a door into the Hoose. That door must be open or the\nlassie must have the key, for she comes there whenever she likes. Now,\nat each end o' the place the doors are lockit, but the front that looks\non the garden is open, wi' muckle posts and flower-pots. The trouble is\nthat that side there's maybe twenty feet o' a wall between the pawrapet\nand the ground. It's an auld wall wi' cracks and holes in it, and it\nwouldn't be ill to sklim. That's why they let her gang there when she\nwants, for a lassie couldn't get away without breakin' her neck.\"\n\n\"Could we climb it?\" Heritage asked.\n\nThe boy wrinkled his brows. \"I could manage it mysel'--I think--and\nmaybe you. I doubt if auld McCunn could get up. Ye'd have to be mighty\ncarefu' that nobody saw ye, for your hinder end, as ye were sklimmin',\nwad be a grand mark for a gun.\"\n\n\"Lead on,\" said Heritage. \"We'll try the verandah.\"\n\nThey both looked at Dickson, and Dickson, scarlet in the face, looked\nback at them. He had suddenly found the thought of a solitary march to\nAuchenlochan intolerable. Once again he was at the parting of the ways,\nand once more caprice determined his decision. That the coal-hole was\nout of the question had worked a change in his views. Somehow it seemed\nto him less burglarious to enter by a verandah. He felt very frightened\nbut--for the moment--quite resolute.\n\n\"I'm coming with you,\" he said.\n\n\"Sportsman,\" said Heritage and held out his hand. \"Well done, the auld\nyin,\" said the Chieftain of the Gorbals Die-Hards. Dickson's quaking\nheart experienced a momentary bound as he followed Heritage down the\ntrack into the Garple Dean.\n\nThe track wound through a thick covert of hazels, now close to the\nrushing water, now high upon the bank so that clear sky showed through\nthe fringes of the wood. When they had gone a little way Dougal halted\nthem.\n\n\"It's a ticklish job,\" he whispered. \"There's the tinklers, mind, that's\ncampin' in the Dean. If they're still in their camp we can get by easy\nenough, but they're maybe wanderin' about the wud after rabbits.... Then\nwe must ford the water, for ye'll no' cross it lower down where it's\ndeep.... Our road is on the Hoose side o' the Dean and it's awfu' public\nif there's onybody on the other side, though it's hid well enough from\nfolk up in the policies.... Ye must do exactly what I tell ye. When we\nget near danger I'll scout on ahead, and I daur ye to move a hair o'\nyour head till I give the word.\"\n\nPresently, when they were at the edge of the water, Dougal announced his\nintention of crossing. Three boulders in the stream made a bridge for an\nactive man and Heritage hopped lightly over. Not so Dickson, who stuck\nfast on the second stone, and would certainly have fallen in had not\nDougal plunged into the current and steadied him with a grimy hand. The\nleap was at last successfully taken, and the three scrambled up a rough\nscaur, all reddened with iron springs, till they struck a slender track\nrunning down the Dean on its northern side. Here the undergrowth was\nvery thick, and they had gone the better part of half a mile before the\ncovert thinned sufficiently to show them the stream beneath. Then Dougal\nhalted them with a finger on his lips, and crept forward alone.\n\nHe returned in three minutes. \"Coast's clear,\" he whispered. \"The\ntinklers are eatin' their breakfast. They're late at their meat though\nthey're up early seekin' it.\"\n\nProgress was now very slow and secret and mainly on all fours. At one\npoint Dougal nodded downward, and the other two saw on a patch of turf,\nwhere the Garple began to widen into its estuary, a group of figures\nround a small fire. There were four of them, all men, and Dickson\nthought he had never seen such ruffianly-looking customers. After that\nthey moved high up the slope, in a shallow glade of a tributary burn,\ntill they came out of the trees and found themselves looking seaward.\n\nOn one side was the House, a hundred yards or so back from the edge, the\nroof showing above the precipitous scarp. Half-way down the slope became\neasier, a jumble of boulders and boiler-plates, till it reached the\nwaters of the small haven, which lay calm as a mill-pond in the windless\nforenoon. The haven broadened out at its foot and revealed a segment of\nblue sea. The opposite shore was flatter and showed what looked like an\nold wharf and the ruins of buildings, behind which rose a bank clad with\nscrub and surmounted by some gnarled and wind-crooked firs.\n\n\"There's dashed little cover here,\" said Heritage.\n\n\"There's no muckle,\" Dougal assented. \"But they canna see us from the\npolicies, and it's no' like there's anybody watchin' from the Hoose. The\ndanger is somebody on the other side, but we'll have to risk it. Once\namong thae big stones we're safe. Are ye ready?\"\n\nFive minutes later Dickson found himself gasping in the lee of a\nboulder, while Dougal was making a cast forward. The scout returned with\na hopeful report. \"I think we're safe, till we get into the policies.\nThere's a road that the auld folk made when ships used to come here.\nDown there it's deeper than Clyde at the Broomilaw. Has the auld yin got\nhis wind yet? There's no time to waste.\"\n\nUp that broken hillside they crawled, well in the cover of the tumbled\nstones, till they reached a low wall which was the boundary of the\ngarden. The House was now behind them on their right rear, and as they\ntopped the crest they had a glimpse of an ancient dovecot and the ruins\nof the old Huntingtower on the short thymy turf which ran seaward to the\ncliffs. Dougal led them along a sunk fence which divided the downs from\nthe lawns behind the house, and, avoiding the stables, brought them by\ndevious ways to a thicket of rhododendrons and broom. On all fours they\ntravelled the length of the place, and came to the edge where some\nforgotten gardeners had once tended a herbaceous border. The border was\nnow rank and wild, and, lying flat under the shade of an azalea, and\npeering through the young spears of iris, Dickson and Heritage regarded\nthe north-western fa\u00c3\u00a7ade of the house.\n\nThe ground before them had been a sunken garden, from which a steep\nwall, once covered with creepers and rock plants, rose to a long\nverandah, which was pillared and open on that side; but at each end\nbuilt up half-way and glazed for the rest. There was a glass roof, and\ninside untended shrubs sprawled in broken plaster vases.\n\n\"Ye must bide here,\" said Dougal, \"and no cheep above your breath. Afore\nwe dare to try that wall, I must ken where Lean and Spittal and Dobson\nare. I'm off to spy the policies.\" He glided out of sight behind a clump\nof pampas grass.\n\nFor hours, so it seemed, Dickson was left to his own unpleasant\nreflections. His body, prone on the moist earth, was fairly comfortable,\nbut his mind was ill at ease. The scramble up the hillside had convinced\nhim that he was growing old, and there was no rebound in his soul to\ncounter the conviction. He felt listless, spiritless--an apathy with\nfright trembling somewhere at the back of it. He regarded the verandah\nwall with foreboding. How on earth could he climb that? And if he did\nthere would be his exposed hinder-parts inviting a shot from some\nmalevolent gentleman among the trees. He reflected that he would give a\nlarge sum of money to be out of this preposterous adventure.\n\nHeritage's hand was stretched towards him, containing two of Mrs.\nMorran's jellied scones, of which the Poet had been wise enough to bring\na supply in his pocket. The food cheered him, for he was growing very\nhungry, and he began to take an interest in the scene before him instead\nof his own thoughts. He observed every detail of the verandah. There was\na door at one end, he noted, giving on a path which wound down to the\nsunk garden. As he looked he heard a sound of steps and saw a man\nascending this path.\n\nIt was the lame man whom Dougal had called Spittal, the dweller in the\nSouth Lodge. Seen at closer quarters he was an odd-looking being, lean\nas a heron, wry-necked, but amazingly quick on his feet. Had not Mrs.\nMorran said that he hobbled as fast as other folk ran? He kept his eyes\non the ground and seemed to be talking to himself as he went, but he was\nalert enough, for the dropping of a twig from a dying magnolia\ntransferred him in an instant into a figure of active vigilance. No\nrisks could be run with that watcher. He took a key from his pocket,\nopened the garden door and entered the verandah. For a moment his\nshuffle sounded on its tiled floor, and then he entered the door\nadmitting from the verandah to the House. It was clearly unlocked for\nthere came no sound of a turning key.\n\nDickson had finished the last crumbs of his scones before the man\nemerged again. He seemed to be in a greater hurry than ever, as he\nlocked the garden door behind him and hobbled along the west front of\nthe House till he was lost to sight. After that the time passed slowly.\nA pair of yellow wagtails arrived and played at hide-and-seek among the\nstuccoed pillars. The little dry scratch of their claws was heard\nclearly in the still air. Dickson had almost fallen asleep when a\nsmothered exclamation from Heritage woke him to attention. A girl had\nappeared in the verandah.\n\nAbove the parapet he saw only her body from the waist up. She seemed to\nbe clad in bright colours, for something red was round her shoulders and\nher hair was bound with an orange scarf. She was tall--that he could\ntell, tall and slim and very young. Her face was turned seaward, and she\nstood for a little scanning the broad channel, shading her eyes as if\nto search for something on the extreme horizon. The air was very quiet\nand he thought that he could hear her sigh. Then she turned and\nre-entered the House, while Heritage by his side began to curse under\nhis breath with a shocking fervour.\n\nOne of Dickson's troubles had been that he did not really believe\nDougal's story, and the sight of the girl removed one doubt. That bright\nexotic thing did not belong to the Cruives or to Scotland at all, and\nthat she should be in the House removed the place from the conventional\ndwelling to which the laws against burglary applied.\n\nThere was a rustle among the rhododendrons and the fiery face of Dougal\nappeared. He lay between the other two, his chin on his hands, and\ngrunted out his report.\n\n\"After they had their dinner Dobson and Lean yokit a horse and went off\nto Auchenlochan. I seen them pass the Garple brig, so that's two\naccounted for. Has Spittal been round here?\"\n\n\"Half an hour ago,\" said Heritage, consulting a wrist watch.\n\n\"It was him that keepit me waitin' so long. But he's safe enough now,\nfor five minutes syne he was splittin' firewood at the back door o' his\nhoose.... I've found a ladder, an auld yin in ahint yon lot o' bushes.\nIt'll help wi' the wall. There! I've gotten my breath again and we can\nstart.\"\n\nThe ladder was fetched by Heritage and proved to be ancient and wanting\nmany rungs, but sufficient in length. The three stood silent for a\nmoment, listening like stags, and then ran across the intervening lawn\nto the foot of the verandah wall. Dougal went up first, then Heritage,\nand lastly Dickson, stiff and giddy from his long lie under the bushes.\nBelow the parapet the verandah floor was heaped with old garden litter,\nrotten matting, dead or derelict bulbs, fibre, withies and strawberry\nnets. It was Dougal's intention to pull up the ladder and hide it among\nthe rubbish against the hour of departure. But Dickson had barely put\nhis foot on the parapet when there was a sound of steps within the House\napproaching the verandah door.\n\nThe ladder was left alone. Dougal's hand brought Dickson summarily to\nthe floor, where he was fairly well concealed by a mess of matting.\nUnfortunately his head was in the vicinity of some upturned pot-plants,\nso that a cactus ticked his brow and a spike of aloe supported painfully\nthe back of his neck. Heritage was prone behind two old water-butts, and\nDougal was in a hamper which had once contained seed potatoes. The house\ndoor had panels of opaque glass, so the new-comer could not see the\ndoings of the three till it was opened, and by that time all were in\ncover.\n\nThe man--it was Spittal--walked rapidly along the verandah and out of\nthe garden door. He was talking to himself again, and Dickson, who had a\nglimpse of his face, thought he looked both evil and furious. Then came\nsome anxious moments, for had the man glanced back when he was once\noutside, he must have seen the tell-tale ladder. But he seemed immersed\nin his own reflections, for he hobbled steadily along the house front\ntill he was lost to sight.\n\n\"That'll be the end o' them the night,\" said Dougal, as he helped\nHeritage to pull up the ladder and stow it away. \"We've got the place to\noursels, now. Forward, men, forward.\" He tried the handle of the house\ndoor and led the way in.\n\nA narrow paved passage took them into what had once been the garden\nroom, where the lady of the house had arranged her flowers, and the\ntennis racquets and croquet mallets had been kept. It was very dusty and\non the cobwebbed walls still hung a few soiled garden overalls. A door\nbeyond opened into a huge murky hall, murky, for the windows were\nshuttered, and the only light came through things like port-holes far up\nin the wall. Dougal, who seemed to know his way about, halted them.\n\"Stop here till I scout a bit. The women bide in a wee room through that\nmuckle door.\" Bare feet stole across the oak flooring, there was the\nsound of a door swinging on its hinges, and then silence and darkness.\nDickson put out a hand for companionship and clutched Heritage's; to his\nsurprise it was cold and all a-tremble. They listened for voices, and\nthought they could detect a far-away sob.\n\nIt was some minutes before Dougal returned. \"A bonny kettle o' fish,\" he\nwhispered. \"They're both greetin'. We're just in time. Come on, the pair\no' ye.\"\n\nThrough a green baize door they entered a passage which led to the\nkitchen regions, and turned in at the first door on their right. From\nits situation Dickson calculated that the room lay on the seaward side\nof the House next to the verandah. The light was bad, for the two\nwindows were partially shuttered, but it had plainly been a\nsmoking-room, for there were pipe-racks by the hearth, and on the walls\na number of old school and college photographs, a couple of oars with\nemblazoned names, and a variety of stags' and roebucks' heads. There was\nno fire in the grate, but a small oil-stove burned inside the fender. In\na stiff-backed chair sat an elderly woman, who seemed to feel the cold,\nfor she was muffled to the neck in a fur coat. Beside her, so that the\nlate afternoon light caught her face and head, stood a girl.\n\nDickson's first impression was of a tall child. The pose, startled and\nwild and yet curiously stiff and self-conscious, was that of a child\nstriving to remember a forgotten lesson. One hand clutched a\nhandkerchief, the other was closing and unclosing on a knob of the chair\nback. She was staring at Dougal, who stood like a gnome in the centre of\nthe floor. \"Here's the gentlemen I was tellin' ye about,\" was his\nintroduction, but her eyes did not move.\n\nThen Heritage stepped forward. \"We have met before, Mademoiselle,\" he\nsaid. \"Do you remember Easter in 1918--in the house in the Trinit\u00c3\u00a1 dei\nMonte?\"\n\nThe girl looked at him.\n\n\"I do not remember,\" she said slowly.\n\n\"But I was the English officer who had the apartments on the floor\nbelow you. I saw you every morning. You spoke to me sometimes.\"\n\n\"You are a soldier?\" she asked, with a new note in her voice.\n\n\"I was then--till the war finished.\"\n\n\"And now? Why have you come here?\"\n\n\"To offer you help if you need it. If not, to ask your pardon and go\naway.\"\n\nThe shrouded figure in the chair burst suddenly into rapid hysterical\ntalk in some foreign tongue which Dickson suspected of being French.\nHeritage replied in the same language, and the girl joined in with sharp\nquestions. Then the Poet turned to Dickson.\n\n\"This is my friend. If you will trust us we will do our best to save\nyou.\"\n\nThe eyes rested on Dickson's face, and he realised that he was in the\npresence of something the like of which he had never met in his life\nbefore. It was a loveliness greater than he had imagined was permitted\nby the Almighty to His creatures. The little face was more square than\noval, with a low broad brow and proud exquisite eyebrows. The eyes were\nof a colour which he could never decide on; afterwards he used to allege\nobscurely that they were the colour of everything in Spring. There was a\ndelicate pallor in the cheeks, and the face bore signs of suffering and\ncare, possibly even of hunger; but for all that there was youth there,\neternal and triumphant! Not youth such as he had known it, but youth\nwith all history behind it, youth with centuries of command in its blood\nand the world's treasures of beauty and pride in its ancestry. Strange,\nhe thought, that a thing so fine should be so masterful. He felt abashed\nin every inch of him.\n\nAs the eyes rested on him their sorrowfulness seemed to be shot with\nhumour. A ghost of a smile lurked there, to which Dickson promptly\nresponded. He grinned and bowed.\n\n\"Very pleased to meet you, Mem. I'm Mr. McCunn from Glasgow.\"\n\n\"You don't even know my name,\" she said.\n\n\"We don't,\" said Heritage.\n\n\"They call me Saskia. This,\" nodding to the chair, \"is my cousin\nEug\u00c3\u00a8nie.... We are in very great trouble. But why should I tell you? I\ndo not know you. You cannot help me.\"\n\n\"We can try,\" said Heritage. \"Part of your trouble we know already\nthrough that boy. You are imprisoned in this place by scoundrels. We are\nhere to help you to get out. We want to ask no questions--only to do\nwhat you bid us.\"\n\n\"You are not strong enough,\" she said sadly. \"A young man--an old\nman--and a little boy. There are many against us, and any moment there\nmay be more.\"\n\nIt was Dougal's turn to break in. \"There's Lean and Spittal and Dobson\nand four tinklers in the Dean--that's seven; but there's us three and\nfive more Gorbals Die-Hards--that's eight.\"\n\nThere was something in the boy's truculent courage that cheered her.\n\n\"I wonder,\" she said, and her eyes fell on each in turn.\n\nDickson felt impelled to intervene.\n\n\"I think this is a perfectly simple business. Here's a lady shut up in\nthis house against her will by a wheen blagyirds. This is a free country\nand the law doesn't permit that. My advice is for one of us to inform\nthe police at Auchenlochan and get Dobson and his friends took up and\nthe lady set free to do what she likes. That is, if these folks are\nreally molesting her, which is not yet quite clear to my mind.\"\n\n\"Alas! It is not so simple as that,\" she said. \"I dare not invoke your\nEnglish law, for perhaps in the eyes of that law I am a thief.\"\n\n\"Deary me, that's a bad business,\" said the startled Dickson.\n\nThe two women talked together in some strange tongue, and the elder\nappeared to be pleading and the younger objecting. Then Saskia seemed to\ncome to a decision.\n\n\"I will tell you all,\" and she looked straight at Heritage. \"I do not\nthink you would be cruel or false, for you have honourable faces....\nListen, then. I am a Russian and for two years have been an exile. I\nwill not speak of my house, for it is no more, or how I escaped, for it\nis the common tale of all of us. I have seen things more terrible than\nany dream and yet lived, but I have paid a price for such experience.\nFirst I went to Italy where there were friends, and I wished only to\nhave peace among kindly people. About poverty I do not care, for, to us,\nwho have lost all the great things, the want of bread is a little\nmatter. But peace was forbidden me, for I learned that we Russians had\nto win back our fatherland again and that the weakest must work in that\ncause. So I was set my task and it was very hard.... There were jewels\nwhich once belonged to my Emperor--they had been stolen by the brigands\nand must be recovered. There were others still hidden in Russia which\nmust be brought to a safe place. In that work I was ordered to share.\"\n\nShe spoke in almost perfect English, with a certain foreign precision.\nSuddenly she changed to French, and talked rapidly to Heritage.\n\n\"She has told me about her family,\" he said, turning to Dickson. \"It is\namong the greatest in Russia, the very greatest after the throne.\"\nDickson could only stare.\n\n\"Our enemies soon discovered me,\" she went on. \"Oh, but they are very\nclever, these enemies, and they have all the criminals of the world to\naid them. Here you do not understand what they are. You good people in\nEngland think they are well-meaning dreamers who are forced into\nviolence by the persecution of Western Europe. But you are wrong. Some\nhonest fools there are among them, but the power--the true power--lies\nwith madmen and degenerates, and they have for allies the special devil\nthat dwells in each country. That is why they cast their net as wide as\nmankind.\"\n\nShe shivered, and for a second her face wore a look which Dickson never\nforgot, the look of one who has looked over the edge of life into the\nouter dark.\n\n\"There were certain jewels of great price which were about to be turned\ninto guns and armies for our enemies. These our people recovered and the\ncharge of them was laid on me. Who would suspect, they said, a foolish\ngirl? But our enemies were very clever, and soon the hunt was cried\nagainst me. They tried to rob me of them, but they failed, for I too had\nbecome clever. Then they asked the help of the law--first in Italy and\nthen in France. Oh, it was subtly done. Respectable bourgeois, who hated\nthe Bolsheviki but had bought long ago the bonds of my country, desired\nto be repaid their debts out of the property of the Russian Crown which\nmight be found in the West. But behind them were the Jews, and behind\nthe Jews our unsleeping enemies. Once I was enmeshed in the law I would\nbe safe for them, and presently they would find the hiding-place of the\ntreasure, and while the bourgeois were clamouring in the courts, it\nwould be safe in their pockets. So I fled. For months I have been\nfleeing and hiding. They have tried to kidnap me many times, and once\nthey have tried to kill me, but I, too, have become very clever--oh,\nvery clever. And I have learned not to fear.\"\n\nThis simple recital affected Dickson's honest soul with the liveliest\nindignation. \"Sich doings!\" he exclaimed, and he could not forbear from\nwhispering to Heritage an extract from that gentleman's conversation the\nfirst night at Kirkmichael. \"We needn't imitate all their methods, but\nthey've got hold of the right end of the stick. They seek truth and\nreality.\" The reply from the Poet was an angry shrug.\n\n\"Why and how did you come here?\" he asked.\n\n\"I always meant to come to England, for I thought it the sanest place in\na mad world. Also it is a good country to hide in, for it is apart from\nEurope, and your police, as I thought, do not permit evil men to be\ntheir own law. But especially I had a friend, a Scottish gentleman, whom\nI knew in the days when we Russians were still a nation. I saw him again\nin Italy, and since he was kind and brave I told him some part of my\ntroubles. He was called Quentin Kennedy, and now he is dead. He told me\nthat in Scotland he had a lonely ch\u00c3\u00a2teau where I could hide secretly and\nsafely, and against the day when I might be hard-pressed he gave me a\nletter to his steward, bidding him welcome me as a guest when I made\napplication. At that time I did not think I would need such sanctuary,\nbut a month ago the need became urgent, for the hunt in France was very\nclose on me. So I sent a message to the steward as Captain Kennedy told\nme.\"\n\n\"What is his name?\" Heritage asked.\n\nShe spelt it, \"Monsieur Loudon--L-O-U-D-O-N in the town of\nAuchenlochan.\"\n\n\"The factor,\" said Dickson. \"And what then?\"\n\n\"Some spy must have found me out. I had a letter from this Loudon\nbidding me come to Auchenlochan. There I found no steward to receive me,\nbut another letter saying that that night a carriage would be in waiting\nto bring me here. It was midnight when we arrived, and we were brought\nin by strange ways to this house, with no light but a single candle.\nHere we were welcomed indeed, but by an enemy.\"\n\n\"Which?\" asked Heritage. \"Dobson or Lean or Spittal?\"\n\n\"Dobson I do not know. L\u00c3\u00a9on was there. He is no Russian, but a Belgian\nwho was a valet in my father's service till he joined the Bolsheviki.\nNext day the Lett Spidel came, and I knew that I was in very truth\nentrapped. For of all our enemies he is, save one, the most subtle and\nunwearied.\"\n\nHer voice had trailed off into flat weariness. Again Dickson was\nreminded of a child, for her arms hung limp by her side; and her slim\nfigure in its odd clothes was curiously like that of a boy in a school\nblazer. Another resemblance perplexed him. She had a hint of\nJanet--about the mouth--Janet, that solemn little girl those twenty\nyears in her grave.\n\nHeritage was wrinkling his brows. \"I don't think I quite understand. The\njewels? You have them with you?\"\n\nShe nodded.\n\n\"These men wanted to rob you. Why didn't they do it between here and\nAuchenlochan? You had no chance to hide them on the journey. Why did\nthey let you come here where you were in a better position to baffle\nthem?\"\n\nShe shook her head. \"I cannot explain--except perhaps, that Spidel had\nnot arrived that night, and L\u00c3\u00a9on may have been waiting instructions.\"\n\nThe other still looked dissatisfied. \"They are either clumsier villains\nthan I take them to be, or there is something deeper in the business\nthan we understand. These jewels--are they here?\"\n\nHis tone was so sharp that she looked startled--almost suspicious. Then\nshe saw that in his face which reassured her. \"I have them hidden here.\nI have grown very skilful in hiding things.\"\n\n\"Have they searched for them?\"\n\n\"The first day they demanded them of me. I denied all knowledge. Then\nthey ransacked this house--I think they ransack it daily, but I am too\nclever for them. I am not allowed to go beyond the verandah, and when at\nfirst I disobeyed there was always one of them in wait to force me back\nwith a pistol behind my head. Every morning L\u00c3\u00a9on brings us food for the\nday--good food, but not enough, so that Cousin Eug\u00c3\u00a8nie is always hungry,\nand each day he and Spidel question and threaten me. This afternoon\nSpidel has told me that their patience is at an end. He has given me\ntill to-morrow at noon to produce the jewels. If not, he says I will\ndie.\"\n\n\"Mercy on us!\" Dickson exclaimed.\n\n\"There will be no mercy for us,\" she said solemnly. \"He and his kind\nthink as little of shedding blood as of spilling water. But I do not\nthink he will kill me. I think I will kill him first, but after that I\nshall surely die. As for Cousin Eug\u00c3\u00a8nie, I do not know.\"\n\nHer level matter-of-fact tone seemed to Dickson most shocking, for he\ncould not treat it as mere melodrama. It carried a horrid conviction.\n\"We must get you out of this at once,\" he declared.\n\n\"I cannot leave. I will tell you why. When I came to this country I\nappointed one to meet me here. He is a kinsman who knows England well,\nfor he fought in your army. With him by my side I have no fear. It is\naltogether needful that I wait for him.\"\n\n\"Then there is something more which you haven't told us?\" Heritage\nasked.\n\nWas there the faintest shadow of a blush on her cheek? \"There is\nsomething more,\" she said.\n\nShe spoke to Heritage in French and Dickson caught the name \"Alexis\" and\na word which sounded like \"prance.\" The Poet listened eagerly and\nnodded. \"I have heard of him,\" he said.\n\n\"But have you not seen him? A tall man with a yellow beard, who bears\nhimself proudly. Being of my mother's race he has eyes like mine.\"\n\n\"That's the man she was askin' me about yesterday,\" said Dougal, who had\nsquatted on the floor.\n\nHeritage shook his head. \"We only came here last night. When did you\nexpect Prince--your friend?\"\n\n\"I hoped to find him here before me. Oh, it is his not coming that\nterrifies me. I must wait and hope. But if he does not come in time\nanother may come before him.\"\n\n\"The ones already here are not all the enemies that threaten you?\"\n\n\"Indeed, no. The worst has still to come, and till I know he is here I\ndo not greatly fear Spidel or L\u00c3\u00a9on. They receive orders and do not give\nthem.\"\n\nHeritage ran a perplexed hand through his hair. The sunset which had\nbeen flaming for some time in the unshuttered panes was now passing into\nthe dark. The girl lit a lamp after first shuttering the rest of the\nwindows. As she turned it up the odd dusty room and its strange company\nwere revealed more clearly and Dickson saw with a shock how haggard was\nthe beautiful face. A great pity seized him and almost conquered his\ntimidity.\n\n\"It is very difficult to help you,\" Heritage was saying. \"You won't\nleave this place, and you won't claim the protection of the law. You are\nvery independent, Mademoiselle, but it can't go on for ever. The man you\nfear may arrive at any moment. At any moment, too, your treasure may be\ndiscovered.\"\n\n\"It is that that weighs on me,\" she cried. \"The jewels! They are my\nsolemn trust, but they burden me terribly. If I were only rid of them\nand knew them to be safe I should face the rest with a braver mind.\"\n\n\"If you'll take my advice,\" said Dickson slowly, \"you'll get them\ndeposited in a bank and take a receipt for them. A Scotch bank is no' in\na hurry to surrender a deposit without it gets the proper authority.\"\n\nHeritage brought his hands together with a smack. \"That's an idea. Will\nyou trust us to take these things and deposit them safely?\"\n\nFor a little she was silent and her eyes were fixed on each of the trio\nin turn. \"I will trust you,\" she said at last. \"I think you will not\nbetray me.\"\n\n\"By God, we won't!\" said the Poet fervently. \"Dogson, it's up to you.\nYou march off to Glasgow in double quick time and place the stuff in\nyour own name in your own bank. There's not a moment to lose. D'you\nhear?\"\n\n\"I will that.\" To his own surprise Dickson spoke without hesitation.\nPartly it was because of his merchant's sense of property, which made\nhim hate the thought that miscreants should acquire that to which they\nhad no title; but mainly it was the appeal in those haggard childish\neyes. \"But I'm not going to be tramping the country in the night\ncarrying a fortune and seeking for trains that aren't there. I'll go the\nfirst thing in the morning.\"\n\n\"Where are they?\" Heritage asked.\n\n\"That I do not tell. But I will fetch them.\"\n\nShe left the room and presently returned with three odd little parcels\nwrapped in leather and tied with thongs of raw hide. She gave them to\nHeritage, who held them appraisingly in his hand and then passed them to\nDickson.\n\n\"I do not ask about their contents. We take them from you as they are,\nand, please God, when the moment comes they will be returned to you as\nyou gave them. You trust us, Mademoiselle?\"\n\n\"I trust you, for you are a soldier. Oh, and I thank you from my heart,\nmy friends.\" She held out a hand to each, which caused Heritage to grow\nsuddenly very red.\n\n\"I will remain in the neighbourhood to await developments,\" he said.\n\"We had better leave you now. Dougal, lead on.\"\n\nBefore going, he took the girl's hand again, and with a sudden movement\nbent and kissed it. Dickson shook it heartily. \"Cheer up, Mem,\" he\nobserved. \"There's a better time coming.\" His last recollection of her\neyes was of a soft mistiness not far from tears. His pouch and pipe had\nstrange company jostling them in his pocket as he followed the others\ndown the ladder into the night.\n\nDougal insisted that they must return by the road of the morning. \"We\ndaren't go by the Laver, for that would bring us by the public-house. If\nthe worst comes to the worst, and we fall in wi' any of the deevils,\nthey must think ye've changed your mind and come back from\nAuchenlochan.\"\n\nThe night smelt fresh and moist as if a break in the weather were\nimminent. As they scrambled along the Garple Dean a pinprick of light\nbelow showed where the tinklers were busy by their fire. Dickson's\nspirits suffered a sharp fall and he began to marvel at his temerity.\nWhat in Heaven's name had he undertaken? To carry very precious things,\nto which certainly he had no right, through the enemy to distant\nGlasgow. How could he escape the notice of the watchers? He was already\nsuspect, and the sight of him back again in Dalquharter would double\nthat suspicion. He must brazen it out, but he distrusted his powers with\nsuch tell-tale stuff in his pockets. They might murder him anywhere on\nthe moor road or in an empty railway carriage. An unpleasant memory of\nvarious novels he had read in which such things happened haunted his\nmind.... There was just one consolation. This job over, he would be quit\nof the whole business. And honourably quit, too, for he would have\nplayed a manly part in a most unpleasant affair. He could retire to the\nidyllic with the knowledge that he had not been wanting when Romance\ncalled. Not a soul should ever hear of it, but he saw himself in the\nfuture tramping green roads or sitting by his winter fireside pleasantly\nretelling himself the tale.\n\nBefore they came to the Garple bridge Dougal insisted that they should\nseparate, remarking that \"it would never do if we were seen thegither.\"\nHeritage was despatched by a short cut over fields to the left, which\neventually, after one or two plunges into ditches, landed him safely in\nMrs. Morran's back yard. Dickson and Dougal crossed the bridge and\ntramped Dalquharter-wards by the highway. There was no sign of human\nlife in that quiet place with owls hooting and rabbits rustling in the\nundergrowth. Beyond the woods they came in sight of the light in the\nback kitchen, and both seemed to relax their watchfulness when it was\nmost needed. Dougal sniffed the air and looked seaward.\n\n\"It's coming on to rain,\" he observed. \"There should be a muckle star\nthere, and when you can't see it it means wet weather wi' this wind.\"\n\n\"What star?\" Dickson asked.\n\n\"The one wi' the Irish-lukkin' name. What's that they call it? O'Brien?\"\nAnd he pointed to where the constellation of the Hunter should have been\ndeclining on the western horizon.\n\nThere was a bend of the road behind them, and suddenly round it came a\ndogcart driven rapidly. Dougal slipped like a weasel into a bush, and\npresently Dickson stood revealed in the glare of a lamp. The horse was\npulled up sharply and the driver called out to him. He saw that it was\nDobson the innkeeper with L\u00c3\u00a9on beside him.\n\n\"Who is it?\" cried the voice. \"Oh, you! I thought ye were off the day?\"\n\nDickson rose nobly to the occasion.\n\n\"I thought myself I was. But I didn't think much of Auchenlochan, and I\ntook a fancy to come back and spend the last night of my holiday with my\nAuntie. I'm off to Glasgow first thing the morn's morn.\"\n\n\"So!\" said the voice. \"Queer thing I never saw ye on the Auchenlochan\nroad, where ye can see three mile before ye.\"\n\n\"I left early and took it easy along the shore.\"\n\n\"Did ye so? Well, good-night to ye.\"\n\nFive minutes later Dickson walked into Mrs. Morran's kitchen, where\nHeritage was busy making up for a day of short provender.\n\n\"I'm for Glasgow to-morrow, Auntie Phemie,\" he cried. \"I want you to\nloan me a wee trunk with a key, and steek the doors and windows, for\nI've a lot to tell you.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nHOW MR. McCUNN DEPARTED WITH RELIEF AND RETURNED WITH RESOLUTION\n\n\nAt seven o'clock on the following morning the post-cart, summoned by an\nearly message from Mrs. Morran, appeared outside the cottage. In it sat\nthe ancient postman, whose real home was Auchenlochan, but who slept\nalternate nights in Dalquharter, and beside him Dobson the innkeeper.\nDickson and his hostess stood at the garden-gate, the former with his\npack on his back and at his feet a small stout wooden box, of the kind\nin which cheeses are transported, garnished with an immense padlock.\nHeritage for obvious reasons did not appear; at the moment he was\ncrouched on the floor of the loft watching the departure through a gap\nin the dimity curtains.\n\nThe traveller, after making sure that Dobson was looking, furtively\nslipped the key of the trunk into his knapsack.\n\n\"Well, good-bye, Auntie Phemie,\" he said. \"I'm sure you've been awful\nkind to me, and I don't know how to thank you for all you're sending.\"\n\n\"Tuts, Dickson, my man, they're hungry folk about Glesca that'll be glad\no' my scones and jeelie. Tell Mirren I'm rale pleased wi' her man and\nhaste ye back soon.\"\n\nThe trunk was deposited on the floor of the cart and Dickson clambered\ninto the back seat. He was thankful that he had not to sit next to\nDobson, for he had tell-tale stuff on his person. The morning was wet,\nso he wore his waterproof, which concealed his odd tendency to stoutness\nabout the middle.\n\nMrs. Morran played her part well, with all the becoming gravity of an\naffectionate aunt, but so soon as the post-cart turned the bend of the\nroad her demeanour changed. She was torn with convulsions of silent\nlaughter. She retreated to the kitchen, sank into a chair, wrapped her\nface in her apron and rocked. Heritage, descending, found her struggling\nto regain composure. \"D'ye ken his wife's name?\" she gasped. \"I ca'ed\nher Mirren! And maybe the body's no mairried! Hech sirs! Hech sirs!\"\n\nMeantime Dickson was bumping along the moor-road on the back of the\npost-cart. He had worked out a plan, just as he had been used aforetime\nto devise a deal in foodstuffs. He had expected one of the watchers to\nturn up, and was rather relieved that it should be Dobson, whom he\nregarded as \"the most natural beast\" of the three. Somehow he did not\nthink that he would be molested before he reached the station, since his\nenemies would still be undecided in their minds. Probably they only\nwanted to make sure that he had really departed to forget all about him.\nBut if not, he had his plan ready.\n\n\"Are you travelling to-day?\" he asked the innkeeper.\n\n\"Just as far as the station to see about some oil-cake I'm expectin'.\nWhat's in your wee kist? Ye came here wi' nothing but the bag on your\nback.\"\n\n\"Ay, the kist is no' mine. It's my auntie's. She's a kind body, and\nnothing would serve but she must pack a box for me to take back. Let me\nsee. There's a baking of scones; three pots of honey and one of rhubarb\njam--she was aye famous for her rhubarb jam; a mutton ham, which you\ncan't get for love or money in Glasgow; some home-made black puddings\nand a wee skim-milk cheese. I doubt I'll have to take a cab from the\nstation.\"\n\nDobson appeared satisfied, lit a short pipe and relapsed into\nmeditation. The long uphill road, ever climbing to where far off showed\nthe tiny whitewashed buildings which were the railway station, seemed\ninterminable this morning. The aged postman addressed strange\nobjurgations to his aged horse and muttered reflections to himself, the\ninnkeeper smoked, and Dickson stared back into the misty hollow where\nlay Dalquharter. The south-west wind had brought up a screen of rain\nclouds and washed all the countryside in a soft wet grey. But the eye\ncould still travel a fair distance, and Dickson thought he had a glimpse\nof a figure on a bicycle leaving the village two miles back. He wondered\nwho it could be. Not Heritage, who had no bicycle. Perhaps some woman\nwho was conspicuously late for the train. Women were the chief cyclists\nnowadays in country places.\n\nThen he forgot about the bicycle and twisted his neck to watch the\nstation. It was less than a mile off now, and they had no time to\nspare, for away to the south among the hummocks of the bog he saw the\nsmoke of the train coming from Auchenlochan. The postman also saw it and\nwhipped up his beast into a clumsy canter. Dickson, always nervous about\nbeing late for trains, forced his eyes away and regarded again the road\nbehind them. Suddenly the cyclist had become quite plain--a little more\nthan a mile behind--a man, and pedalling furiously in spite of the stiff\nascent.... It could only be one person--L\u00c3\u00a9on. He must have discovered\ntheir visit to the House yesterday and be on the way to warn Dobson. If\nhe reached the station before the train, there would be no journey to\nGlasgow that day for one respectable citizen.\n\nDickson was in a fever of impatience and fright. He dared not abjure the\npostman to hurry, lest Dobson should turn his head and descry his\ncolleague. But that ancient man had begun to realise the shortness of\ntime and was urging the cart along at a fair pace, since they were now\non the flatter shelf of land which carried the railway. Dickson kept his\neyes fixed on the bicycle and his teeth shut tight on his lower lip. Now\nit was hidden by the last dip of hill; now it emerged into view not a\nquarter of a mile behind, and its rider gave vent to a shrill call.\nLuckily the innkeeper did not hear, for at that moment with a jolt the\ncart pulled up at the station door, accompanied by the roar of the\nincoming train.\n\nDickson whipped down from the back seat and seized the solitary porter.\n\"Label the box for Glasgow and into the van with it. Quick, man, and\nthere'll be a shilling for you.\" He had been doing some rapid thinking\nthese last minutes and had made up his mind. If Dobson and he were alone\nin a carriage he could not have the box there; that must be elsewhere,\nso that Dobson could not examine it if he were set on violence,\nsomewhere in which it could still be a focus of suspicion and attract\nattention from his person. He took his ticket, and rushed on to the\nplatform, to find the porter and the box at the door of the guard's van.\nDobson was not there. With the vigour of a fussy traveller he shouted\ndirections to the guard to take good care of his luggage, hurled a\nshilling at the porter and ran for a carriage. At that moment he became\naware of Dobson hurrying through the entrance. He must have met L\u00c3\u00a9on and\nheard news from him, for his face was red and his ugly brows darkening.\n\nThe train was in motion. \"Here, you!\" Dobson's voice shouted. \"Stop! I\nwant a word wi' ye.\" Dickson plunged at a third-class carriage, for he\nsaw faces behind the misty panes, and above all things then he feared an\nempty compartment. He clambered on to the step, but the handle would not\nturn, and with a sharp pang of fear he felt the innkeeper's grip on his\narm. Then some Samaritan from within let down the window, opened the\ndoor and pulled him up. He fell on a seat and a second later Dobson\nstaggered in beside him.\n\nThank Heaven, the dirty little carriage was nearly full. There were two\nherds, each with a dog and a long hazel crook, and an elderly woman who\nlooked like a ploughman's wife out for a day's marketing. And there was\none other whom Dickson recognised with a peculiar joy--the bagman in the\nprovision line of business whom he had met three days before at\nKilchrist.\n\nThe recognition was mutual. \"Mr. McCunn!\" the bagman exclaimed. \"My, but\nthat was running it fine! I hope you've had a pleasant holiday, sir?\"\n\n\"Very pleasant. I've been spending two nights with friends down\nhereaways. I've been very fortunate in the weather, for it has broke\njust when I'm leaving.\"\n\nDickson sank back on the hard cushions. It had been a near thing, but so\nfar he had won. He wished his heart did not beat so fast, and he hoped\nhe did not betray his disorder in his face. Very deliberately he hunted\nfor his pipe and filled it slowly. Then he turned to Dobson. \"I didn't\nknow you were travelling the day. What about your oil-cake?\"\n\n\"I've changed my mind,\" was the gruff answer.\n\n\"Was that you I heard crying on me, when we were running for the train?\"\n\n\"Ay. I thought ye had forgot about your kist.\"\n\n\"No fear,\" said Dickson. \"I'm no' likely to forget my auntie's scones.\"\n\nHe laughed pleasantly and then turned to the bagman. Thereafter the\ncompartment hummed with the technicalities of the grocery trade. He\nexerted himself to draw out his companion, to have him refer to the\ngreat firm of D. McCunn, so that the innkeeper might be ashamed of his\nsuspicions. What nonsense to imagine that a noted and wealthy Glasgow\nmerchant--the bagman's tone was almost reverential--would concern\nhimself with the affairs of a forgotten village and a tumbledown house!\n\nPresently the train drew up at Kirkmichael station. The woman descended,\nand Dobson, after making sure that no one else meant to follow her\nexample, also left the carriage. A porter was shouting: \"Fast train to\nGlasgow--Glasgow next stop.\" Dickson watched the innkeeper shoulder his\nway through the crowd in the direction of the booking office. \"He's off\nto send a telegram,\" he decided. \"There'll be trouble waiting for me at\nthe other end.\"\n\nWhen the train moved on he found himself disinclined for further talk.\nHe had suddenly become meditative, and curled up in a corner with his\nhead hard against the window pane, watching the wet fields and\nglistening roads as they slipped past. He had his plans made for his\nconduct at Glasgow, but Lord! how he loathed the whole business! Last\nnight he had had a kind of gusto in his desire to circumvent villainy;\nat Dalquharter station he had enjoyed a momentary sense of triumph; now\nhe felt very small, lonely and forlorn. Only one thought far at the back\nof his mind cropped up now and then to give him comfort. He was entering\non the last lap. Once get this detestable errand done and he would be a\nfree man, free to go back to the kindly humdrum life from which he\nshould never have strayed. Never again, he vowed, never again. Rather\nwould he spend the rest of his days in hydropathics than come within\nthe pale of such horrible adventures. Romance, forsooth! This was not\nthe mild goddess he had sought, but an awful harpy who battened on the\nsouls of men.\n\nHe had some bad minutes as the train passed through the suburbs, and\nalong the grimy embankment by which the southern lines enter the city.\nBut as it rumbled over the river bridge and slowed down before the\nterminus, his vitality suddenly revived. He was a business man, and\nthere was now something for him to do.\n\nAfter a rapid farewell to the bagman, he found a porter and hustled his\nbox out of the van in the direction of the left-luggage office. Spies,\nsummoned by Dobson's telegram, were, he was convinced, watching his\nevery movement, and he meant to see that they missed nothing. He\nreceived his ticket for the box, and slowly and ostentatiously stowed it\naway in his pack. Swinging the said pack on his arm he sauntered through\nthe entrance hall to the row of waiting taxi-cabs, and selected that one\nwhich seemed to him to have the oldest and most doddering driver. He\ndeposited the pack inside on the seat, and then stood still as if struck\nwith a sudden thought.\n\n\"I breakfasted terrible early,\" he told the driver. \"I think I'll have a\nbite to eat. Will you wait?\"\n\n\"Ay,\" said the man, who was reading a grubby sheet of newspaper. \"I'll\nwait as long as ye like, for it's you that pays.\"\n\nDickson left his pack in the cab and, oddly enough for a careful man, he\ndid not shut the door. He re-entered the station, strolled to the\nbookstall and bought a _Glasgow Herald_. His steps then tended to the\nrefreshment room, where he ordered a cup of coffee and two Bath buns,\nand seated himself at a small table. There he was soon immersed in the\nfinancial news, and though he sipped his coffee he left the buns\nuntasted. He took out a penknife and cut various extracts from the\n_Herald_, bestowing them carefully in his pocket. An observer would have\nseen an elderly gentleman absorbed in market quotations.\n\nAfter a quarter of an hour had been spent in this performance he\nhappened to glance at the clock and rose with an exclamation. He bustled\nout to his taxi and found the driver still intent upon his reading.\n\"Here I am at last,\" he said cheerily, and had a foot on the step, when\nhe stopped suddenly with a cry. It was a cry of alarm, but also of\nsatisfaction.\n\n\"What's become of my pack? I left it on the seat, and now it's gone!\nThere's been a thief here.\"\n\nThe driver, roused from his lethargy, protested in the name of his gods\nthat no one had been near it. \"Ye took it into the station wi' ye,\" he\nurged.\n\n\"I did nothing of the kind. Just you wait here till I see the inspector.\nA bonny watch _you_ keep on a gentleman's things.\"\n\nBut Dickson did not interview the railway authorities. Instead he\nhurried to the left-luggage office. \"I deposited a small box here a\nshort time ago. I mind the number. Is it there still?\"\n\nThe attendant glanced at a shelf. \"A wee deal box with iron bands. It\nwas took out ten minutes syne. A man brought the ticket and took it away\non his shoulder.\"\n\n\"Thank you. There's been a mistake, but the blame's mine. My man mistook\nmy orders.\"\n\nThen he returned to the now nervous taxi-driver. \"I've taken it up with\nthe station-master and he's putting the police on. You'll likely be\nwanted, so I gave him your number. It's a fair disgrace that there\nshould be so many thieves about this station. It's not the first time\nI've lost things. Drive me to West George Street and look sharp.\" And he\nslammed the door with the violence of an angry man.\n\nBut his reflections were not violent, for he smiled to himself. \"That\nwas pretty neat. They'll take some time to get the kist open, for I\ndropped the key out of the train after we left Kirkmichael. That gives\nme a fair start. If I hadn't thought of that, they'd have found some way\nto grip me and ripe me long before I got to the Bank.\" He shuddered as\nhe thought of the dangers he had escaped. \"As it is, they're off the\ntrack for half an hour at least, while they're rummaging among Auntie\nPhemie's scones.\" At the thought he laughed heartily, and when he\nbrought the taxi-cab to a standstill by rapping on the front window, he\nleft it with a temper apparently restored. Obviously he had no grudge\nagainst the driver, who to his immense surprise was rewarded with ten\nshillings.\n\nThree minutes later Mr. McCunn might have been seen entering the head\noffice of the Strathclyde Bank, and inquiring for the manager. There\nwas no hesitation about him now, for his foot was on his native heath.\nThe chief cashier received him with deference, in spite of his\nunorthodox garb, for he was not the least honoured of the bank's\ncustomers. As it chanced he had been talking about him that very morning\nto a gentleman from London. \"The strength of this city,\" he had said,\ntapping his eyeglasses on his knuckles, \"does not lie in its dozen very\nrich men, but in the hundred or two homely folk who make no parade of\nwealth. Men like Dickson McCunn, for example, who live all their life in\na semi-detached villa and die worth half a million.\" And the Londoner\nhad cordially assented.\n\nSo Dickson was ushered promptly into an inner room, and was warmly\ngreeted by Mr. Mackintosh, the patron of the Gorbals Die-Hards.\n\n\"I must thank you for your generous donation, McCunn. Those boys will\nget a little fresh air and quiet after the smoke and din of Glasgow. A\nlittle country peace to smooth out the creases in their poor little\nsouls.\"\n\n\"Maybe,\" said Dickson, with a vivid recollection of Dougal as he had\nlast seen him. Somehow he did not think that peace was likely to be the\nportion of that devoted band. \"But I've not come here to speak about\nthat.\"\n\nHe took off his waterproof; then his coat and waistcoat; and showed\nhimself a strange figure with sundry bulges about the middle. The\nmanager's eyes grew very round. Presently these excrescences were\nrevealed as linen bags sewn on to his shirt, and fitting into the hollow\nbetween ribs and hip. With some difficulty he slit the bags and\nextracted three hide-bound packages.\n\n\"See here, Mackintosh,\" he said solemnly. \"I hand you over these\nparcels, and you're to put them in the innermost corner of your strong\nroom. You needn't open them. Just put them away as they are, and write\nme a receipt for them. Write it now.\"\n\nMr. Mackintosh obediently took pen in hand.\n\n\"What'll I call them?\" he asked.\n\n\"Just the three leather parcels handed to you by Dickson McCunn, Esq.,\nnaming the date.\"\n\nMr. Mackintosh wrote. He signed his name with his usual flourish and\nhanded the slip to his client.\n\n\"Now,\" said Dickson, \"you'll put that receipt in the strong box where\nyou keep my securities, and you'll give it up to nobody but me in\nperson, and you'll surrender the parcels only on presentation of the\nreceipt. D'you understand?\"\n\n\"Perfectly. May I ask any questions?\"\n\n\"You'd better not if you don't want to hear lees.\"\n\n\"What's in the packages?\" Mr. Mackintosh weighed them in his hand.\n\n\"That's asking,\" said Dickson. \"But I'll tell ye this much. It's jools.\"\n\n\"Your own?\"\n\n\"No, but I'm their trustee.\"\n\n\"Valuable?\"\n\n\"I was hearing they were worth more than a million pounds.\"\n\n\"God bless my soul,\" said the startled manager. \"I don't like this kind\nof business, McCunn.\"\n\n\"No more do I. But you'll do it to oblige an old friend and a good\ncustomer. If you don't know much about the packages you know all about\nme. Now, mind, I trust you.\"\n\nMr. Mackintosh forced himself to a joke. \"Did you maybe steal them?\"\n\nDickson grinned. \"Just what I did. And that being so, I want you to let\nme out by the back door.\"\n\nWhen he found himself in the street he felt the huge relief of a boy who\nhad emerged with credit from the dentist's chair. Remembering that there\nwould be no midday dinner for him at home, his first step was to feed\nheavily at a restaurant. He had, so far as he could see, surmounted all\nhis troubles, his one regret being that he had lost his pack, which\ncontained among other things his _Izaak Walton_ and his safety razor. He\nbought another razor and a new Walton, and mounted an electric tram-car\n_en route_ for home.\n\nVery contented with himself he felt as the car swung across the Clyde\nbridge. He had done well--but of that he did not want to think, for the\nwhole beastly thing was over. He was going to bury that memory, to be\nresurrected perhaps on a later day when the unpleasantness had been\nforgotten. Heritage had his address, and knew where to come when it was\ntime to claim the jewels. As for the watchers, they must have ceased to\nsuspect him, when they discovered the innocent contents of his knapsack\nand Mrs. Morran's box. Home for him, and a luxurious tea by his own\nfireside; and then an evening with his books, for Heritage's nonsense\nhad stimulated his literary fervour. He would dip into his old\nfavourites again to confirm his faith. To-morrow he would go for a jaunt\nsomewhere--perhaps down the Clyde, or to the South of England, which he\nhad heard was a pleasant, thickly peopled country. No more lonely inns\nand deserted villages for him; henceforth he would make certain of\ncomfort and peace.\n\nThe rain had stopped, and, as the car moved down the dreary vista of\nEglinton Street, the sky opened into fields of blue and the April sun\nsilvered the puddles. It was in such place and under such weather that\nDickson suffered an overwhelming experience.\n\nIt is beyond my skill, being all unlearned in the game of\npsycho-analysis, to explain how this thing happened. I concern myself\nonly with facts. Suddenly the pretty veil of self-satisfaction was rent\nfrom top to bottom, and Dickson saw a figure of himself within, a smug\nleaden little figure which simpered and preened itself and was hollow as\na rotten nut. And he hated it.\n\nThe horrid truth burst on him that Heritage had been right. He only\nplayed with life. That imbecile image was a mere spectator, content to\napplaud, but shrinking from the contact of reality. It had been all\nright as a provision merchant, but when it fancied itself capable of\nhigher things it had deceived itself. Foolish little image with its\nbrave dreams and its swelling words from Browning! All make-believe of\nthe feeblest. He was a coward, running away at the first threat of\ndanger. It was as if he were watching a tall stranger with a wand\npointing to the embarrassed phantom that was himself, and ruthlessly\nexposing its frailties! And yet the pitiless showman was himself\ntoo--himself as he wanted to be, cheerful, brave, resourceful,\nindomitable.\n\nDickson suffered a spasm of mortal agony. \"Oh, I'm surely not so bad as\nall that,\" he groaned. But the hurt was not only in his pride. He saw\nhimself being forced to new decisions, and each alternative was of the\nblackest. He fairly shivered with the horror of it. The car slipped past\na suburban station from which passengers were emerging--comfortable\nblack-coated men such as he had once been. He was bitterly angry with\nProvidence for picking him out of the great crowd of sedentary folk for\nthis sore ordeal. \"Why was I tethered to sich a conscience?\" was his\nmoan. But there was that stern inquisitor with his pointer exploring his\nsoul. \"You flatter yourself you have done your share,\" he was saying.\n\"You will make pretty stories about it to yourself, and some day you may\ntell your friends, modestly disclaiming any special credit. But you will\nbe a liar, for you know you are afraid. You are running away when the\nwork is scarcely begun, and leaving it to a few boys and a poet whom you\nhad the impudence the other day to despise. I think you are worse than a\ncoward. I think you are a cad.\"\n\nHis fellow-passengers on the top of the car saw an absorbed middle-aged\ngentleman who seemed to have something the matter with his bronchial\ntubes. They could not guess at the tortured soul. The decision was\ncoming nearer, the alternatives loomed up dark and inevitable. On one\nside was submission to ignominy, on the other a return to that place,\nwhich he detested, and yet loathed himself for detesting. \"It seems I'm\nnot likely to have much peace either way,\" he reflected dismally.\n\nHow the conflict would have ended had it continued on these lines I\ncannot say. The soul of Mr. McCunn was being assailed by moral and\nmetaphysical adversaries with which he had not been trained to deal. But\nsuddenly it leapt from negatives to positives. He saw the face of the\ngirl in the shuttered House, so fair and young and yet so haggard. It\nseemed to be appealing to him to rescue it from a great loneliness and\nfear. Yes, he had been right, it had a strange look of his Janet--the\nwide-open eyes, the solemn mouth. What was to become of that child if he\nfailed her in her great need?\n\nNow Dickson was a practical man and this view of the case brought him\ninto a world which he understood. \"It's fair ridiculous,\" he reflected.\n\"Nobody there to take a grip of things. Just a wheen Gorbals keelies and\nthe lad Heritage. Not a business man among the lot.\"\n\nThe alternatives, which hove before him like two great banks of cloud,\nwere altering their appearance. One was becoming faint and tenuous; the\nother, solid as ever, was just a shade less black. He lifted his eyes\nand saw in the near distance the corner of the road which led to his\nhome. \"I must decide before I reach that corner,\" he told himself.\n\nThen his mind became apathetic. He began to whistle dismally through his\nteeth, watching the corner as it came nearer. The car stopped with a\njerk. \"I'll go back,\" he said aloud, clambering down the steps. The\ntruth was he had decided five minutes before when he first saw Janet's\nface.\n\nHe walked briskly to his house, entirely refusing to waste any more\nenergy on reflection. \"This is a business proposition,\" he told himself,\n\"and I'm going to handle it as sich.\" Tibby was surprised to see him and\noffered him tea in vain. \"I'm just back for a few minutes. Let's see the\nletters.\"\n\nThere was one from his wife. She proposed to stay another week at the\nNeuk Hydropathic and suggested that he might join her and bring her\nhome. He sat down and wrote a long affectionate reply, declining, but\nexpressing his delight that she was soon returning. \"That's very likely\nthe last time Mamma will hear from me,\" he reflected, but--oddly\nenough--without any great fluttering of the heart.\n\nThen he proceeded to be furiously busy. He sent out Tibby to buy another\nknapsack and to order a cab and to cash a considerable cheque. In the\nknapsack he packed a fresh change of clothing and the new safety razor,\nbut no books, for he was past the need of them. That done, he drove to\nhis solicitors.\n\n\"What like a firm are Glendonan and Speirs in Edinburgh?\" he asked the\nsenior partner.\n\n\"Oh, very respectable. Very respectable indeed. Regular Edinburgh W.S.\nlot. Do a lot of factoring.\"\n\n\"I want you to telephone through to them and inquire about a place in\nCarrick called Huntingtower, near the village of Dalquharter. I\nunderstand it's to let, and I'm thinking of taking a lease of it.\"\n\nThe senior partner after some delay got through to Edinburgh, and was\npresently engaged in the feverish dialectic which the long-distance\ntelephone involves. \"I want to speak to Mr. Glendonan himself.... Yes,\nyes, Mr. Caw of Paton and Linklater.... Good afternoon.... Huntingtower.\nYes, in Carrick. Not to let? But I understand it's been in the market\nfor some months. You say you've an idea it has just been let. But my\nclient is positive that you're mistaken, unless the agreement was made\nthis morning.... You'll inquire? Oh, I see. The actual factoring is done\nby your local agent. Mr. James Loudon, in Auchenlochan. You think my\nclient had better get into touch with him at once. Just wait a minute,\nplease.\"\n\nHe put his hand over the receiver. \"Usual Edinburgh way of doing\nbusiness,\" he observed caustically. \"What do you want done?\"\n\n\"I'll run down and see this Loudon. Tell Glendonan and Speirs to advise\nhim to expect me, for I'll go this very day.\"\n\nMr. Caw resumed his conversation. \"My client would like a telegram sent\nat once to Mr. Loudon introducing him. He's Mr. Dickson McCunn of Mearns\nStreet--the great provision merchant, you know. Oh, yes! Good for any\nrent. Refer if you like to the Strathclyde Bank, but you can take my\nword for it. Thank you. Then that's settled. Good-bye.\"\n\nDickson's next visit was to a gunmaker who was a fellow-elder with him\nin the Guthrie Memorial Kirk.\n\n\"I want a pistol and a lot of cartridges,\" he announced. \"I'm not caring\nwhat kind it is, so long as it is a good one and not too big.\"\n\n\"For yourself?\" the gunmaker asked. \"You must have a licence, I doubt,\nand there's a lot of new regulations.\"\n\n\"I can't wait on a licence. It's for a cousin of mine who's off to\nMexico at once. You've got to find some way of obliging an old friend,\nMr. McNair.\"\n\nMr. McNair scratched his head. \"I don't see how I can sell you one. But\nI'll tell you what I'll do--I'll lend you one. It belongs to my nephew,\nPeter Tait, and has been lying in a drawer ever since he came back from\nthe front. He has no use for it now that he's a placed minister.\"\n\nSo Dickson bestowed in the pockets of his waterproof a service revolver\nand fifty cartridges, and bade his cab take him to the shop in Mearns\nStreet. For a moment the sight of the familiar place struck a pang to\nhis breast, but he choked down unavailing regrets. He ordered a great\nhamper of foodstuffs--the most delicate kind of tinned goods, two\nperfect hams, tongues, Strassburg pies, chocolate, cakes, biscuits and,\nas a last thought, half a dozen bottles of old liqueur brandy. It was to\nbe carefully packed, addressed to Mrs. Morran, Dalquharter Station, and\ndelivered in time for him to take down by the 7.33 train. Then he drove\nto the terminus and dined with something like a desperate peace in his\nheart.\n\nOn this occasion he took a first-class ticket, for he wanted to be\nalone. As the lights began to be lit in the wayside stations and the\nclear April dusk darkened into night, his thoughts were sombre yet\nresigned. He opened the window and let the sharp air of the Renfrewshire\nuplands fill the carriage. It was fine weather again after the rain, and\na bright constellation--perhaps Dougal's friend O'Brien--hung in the\nwestern sky. How happy he would have been a week ago had he been\nstarting thus for a country holiday! He could sniff the faint scent of\nmoor-burn and ploughed earth which had always been his first reminder of\nspring. But he had been pitchforked out of that old happy world and\ncould never enter it again. Alas! for the roadside fire, the cosy inn,\nthe _Compleat Angler_, the Chavender or Chub!\n\nAnd yet--and yet! He had done the right thing, though the Lord alone\nknew how it would end. He began to pluck courage from his very\nmelancholy and hope from his reflections upon the transitoriness of\nlife. He was austerely following Romance as he conceived it, and if that\ncapricious lady had taken one dream from him she might yet reward him\nwith a better. Tags of poetry came into his head which seemed to favour\nthis philosophy--particularly some lines of Browning on which he used to\ndiscourse to his Kirk Literary Society. Uncommon silly, he considered,\nthese homilies of his must have been, mere twitterings of the unfledged.\nBut now he saw more in the lines, a deeper interpretation which he had\nearned the right to make.\n\n    \"Oh, world, where all things change and nought abides,\n     Oh, life, the long mutation--is it so?\n     Is it with life as with the body's change?--\n     Where, e'en tho' better follow, good must pass.\"\n\nThat was as far as he could get, though he cudgelled his memory to\ncontinue. Moralising thus, he became drowsy, and was almost asleep when\nthe train drew up at the station of Kirkmichael.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nSUNDRY DOINGS IN THE MIRK\n\n\nFrom Kirkmichael on the train stopped at every station, but no passenger\nseemed to leave or arrive at the little platforms white in the moon. At\nDalquharter the case of provisions was safely transferred to the porter\nwith instructions to take charge of it till it was sent for. During the\nnext ten minutes Dickson's mind began to work upon his problem with a\ncertain briskness. It was all nonsense that the law of Scotland could\nnot be summoned to the defence. The jewels had been safely got rid of,\nand who was to dispute their possession? Not Dobson and his crew, who\nhad no sort of title, and were out for naked robbery. The girl had\nspoken of greater dangers from new enemies--kidnapping perhaps. Well,\nthat was felony, and the police must be brought in. Probably if all were\nknown the three watchers had criminal records, pages long, filed at\nScotland Yard. The man to deal with that side of the business was Loudon\nthe factor, and to him he was bound in the first place. He had made a\nclear picture in his head of this Loudon--a derelict old country writer,\nformal, pedantic, lazy, anxious only to get an unprofitable business off\nhis hands with the least possible trouble, never going near the place\nhimself, and ably supported in his lethargy by conceited Edinburgh\nWriters to the Signet. \"Sich notions of business!\" he murmured. \"I\nwonder that there's a single county family in Scotland no' in the\nbankruptcy court!\" It was his mission to wake up Mr. James Loudon.\n\nArrived at Auchenlochan he went first to the Salutation Hotel, a\npretentious place sacred to golfers. There he engaged a bedroom for the\nnight and, having certain scruples, paid for it in advance. He also had\nsome sandwiches prepared which he stowed in his pack, and filled his\nflask with whisky. \"I'm going home to Glasgow by the first train\nto-morrow,\" he told the landlady, \"and now I've got to see a friend.\nI'll not be back till late.\" He was assured that there would be no\ndifficulty about his admittance at any hour, and directed how to find\nMr. Loudon's dwelling.\n\nIt was an old house fronting direct on the street, with a fanlight above\nthe door and a neat brass plate bearing the legend \"Mr. James Loudon,\nWriter.\" A lane ran up one side leading apparently to a garden, for the\nmoonlight showed the dusk of trees. In front was the main street of\nAuchenlochan, now deserted save for a single roysterer, and opposite\nstood the ancient town house, with arches where the country folk came at\nthe spring and autumn hiring fairs. Dickson rang the antiquated bell,\nand was presently admitted to a dark hall floored with oil-cloth, where\na single gas-jet showed that on one side was the business office and on\nthe other the living-rooms. Mr. Loudon was at supper, he was told, and\nhe sent in his card. Almost at once the door at the end on the left\nside was flung open and a large figure appeared flourishing a napkin.\n\"Come in, sir, come in,\" it cried. \"I've just finished a bite of meat.\nVery glad to see you. Here, Maggie, what d'you mean by keeping the\ngentleman standing in that outer darkness?\"\n\nThe room into which Dickson was ushered was small and bright, with a red\npaper on the walls, a fire burning and a big oil lamp in the centre of a\ntable. Clearly Mr. Loudon had no wife, for it was a bachelor's den in\nevery line of it. A cloth was laid on a corner of the table, on which\nstood the remnants of a meal. Mr. Loudon seemed to have been about to\nmake a brew of punch, for a kettle simmered by the fire, and lemons and\nsugar flanked a pot-bellied whisky decanter of the type that used to be\nknown as a \"mason's mell.\"\n\nThe sight of the lawyer was a surprise to Dickson and dissipated his\nnotions of an aged and lethargic incompetent. Mr. Loudon was a strongly\nbuilt man who could not be a year over fifty. He had a ruddy face,\nclean-shaven except for a grizzled moustache; his grizzled hair was\nthinning round the temples; but his skin was unwrinkled and his eyes had\nall the vigour of youth. His tweed suit was well cut, and the buff\nwaistcoat with flaps and pockets and the plain leather watchguard hinted\nat the sportsman, as did the half-dozen racing prints on the wall. A\npleasant high-coloured figure he made; his voice had the frank ring due\nto much use out of doors; and his expression had the singular candour\nwhich comes from grey eyes with large pupils and a narrow iris.\n\n\"Sit down, Mr. McCunn. Take the arm-chair by the fire. I've had a wire\nfrom Glendonan and Speirs about you. I was just going to have a glass of\ntoddy--a grand thing for these uncertain April nights. You'll join me?\nNo? Well, you'll smoke anyway. There's cigars at your elbow. Certainly,\na pipe if you like. This is Liberty Hall.\"\n\nDickson found some difficulty in the part for which he had cast himself.\nHe had expected to condescend upon an elderly inept and give him sharp\ninstructions; instead he found himself faced with a jovial, virile\nfigure which certainly did not suggest incompetence. It has been\nmentioned already that he had always great difficulty in looking any one\nin the face, and this difficulty was intensified when he found himself\nconfronted with bold and candid eyes. He felt abashed and a little\nnervous.\n\n\"I've come to see you about Huntingtower House,\" he began.\n\n\"I know. So Glendonan's informed me. Well, I'm very glad to hear it. The\nplace has been standing empty far too long, and that is worse for a new\nhouse than an old house. There's not much money to spend on it either,\nunless we can make sure of a good tenant. How did you hear about it?\"\n\n\"I was taking a bit holiday and I spent a night at Dalquharter with an\nold auntie of mine. You must understand I've just retired from business,\nand I'm thinking of finding a country place. I used to have the big\nprovision shop in Mearns Street--now the United Supply Stores, Limited.\nYou've maybe heard of it?\"\n\nThe other bowed and smiled. \"Who hasn't? The name of Dickson McCunn is\nknown far beyond the city of Glasgow.\"\n\nDickson was not insensible of the flattery, and he continued with more\nfreedom. \"I took a walk and got a glisk of the House and I liked the\nlook of it. You see, I want a quiet bit a good long way from a town, and\nat the same time a house with all modern conveniences. I suppose\nHuntingtower has that?\"\n\n\"When it was built fifteen years ago it was considered a model--six\nbathrooms, its own electric light plant, steam heating, an independent\nboiler for hot water, the whole bag of tricks. I won't say but what some\nof these contrivances will want looking to, for the place has been some\ntime empty, but there can be nothing very far wrong, and I can guarantee\nthat the bones of the house are good.\"\n\n\"Well, that's all right,\" said Dickson. \"I don't mind spending a little\nmoney myself if the place suits me. But of that, of course, I'm not yet\ncertain, for I've only had a glimpse of the outside. I wanted to get\ninto the policies, but a man at the lodge wouldn't let me. They're a\nmighty uncivil lot down there.\"\n\n\"I'm very sorry to hear that,\" said Mr. Loudon in a tone of concern.\n\n\"Ay, and if I take the place I'll stipulate that you get rid of the\nlodgekeepers.\"\n\n\"There won't be the slightest difficulty about that, for they are only\nweekly tenants. But I'm vexed to hear they were uncivil. I was glad to\nget any tenant that offered, and they were well recommended to me.\"\n\n\"They're foreigners.\"\n\n\"One of them is--a Belgian refugee that Lady Morewood took an interest\nin. But the other--Spittal, they call him--I thought he was Scotch.\"\n\n\"He's not that. And I don't like the innkeeper either. I would want him\nshifted.\"\n\nMr. Loudon laughed. \"I dare say Dobson is a rough diamond. There's worse\nfolk in the world all the same, but I don't think he will want to stay.\nHe only went there to pass the time till he heard from his brother in\nVancouver. He's a roving spirit, and will be off overseas again.\"\n\n\"That's all right!\" said Dickson, who was beginning to have horrid\nsuspicions that he might be on a wild-goose chase after all. \"Well, the\nnext thing is for me to see over the House.\"\n\n\"Certainly. I'd like to go with you myself. What day would suit you? Let\nme see. This is Friday. What about this day week?\"\n\n\"I was thinking of to-morrow. Since I'm down in these parts I may as\nwell get the job done.\"\n\nMr. Loudon looked puzzled. \"I quite see that. But I don't think it's\npossible. You see, I have to consult the owners and get their consent to\na lease. Of course they have the general purpose of letting, but--well,\nthey're queer folk the Kennedys,\" and his face wore the half-embarrassed\nsmile of an honest man preparing to make confidences. \"When poor Mr.\nQuentin died, the place went to his two sisters in joint ownership. A\nvery bad arrangement, as you can imagine. It isn't entailed, and I've\nalways been pressing them to sell, but so far they won't hear of it.\nThey both married Englishmen, so it will take a day or two to get in\ntouch with them. One, Mrs. Stukely, lives in Devonshire. The other--Miss\nKatie that was--married Sir Francis Morewood, the general, and I hear\nthat she's expected back in London next Monday from the Riviera. I'll\nwire and write first thing to-morrow morning. But you must give me a day\nor two.\"\n\nDickson felt himself waking up. His doubts about his own sanity were\ndissolving, for, as his mind reasoned, the factor was prepared to do\nanything he asked--but only after a week had gone. What he was concerned\nwith was the next few days.\n\n\"All the same I would like to have a look at the place to-morrow, even\nif nothing comes of it.\"\n\nMr. Loudon looked seriously perplexed. \"You will think me absurdly\nfussy, Mr. McCunn, but I must really beg of you to give up the idea. The\nKennedys, as I have said, are--well, not exactly like other people, and\nI have the strictest orders not to let any one visit the house without\ntheir express leave. It sounds a ridiculous rule, but I assure you it's\nas much as my job is worth to disregard it.\"\n\n\"D'you mean to say not a soul is allowed inside the House?\"\n\n\"Not a soul.\"\n\n\"Well, Mr. Loudon, I'm going to tell you a queer thing, which I think\nyou ought to know. When I was taking a walk the other night--your\nBelgian wouldn't let me into the policies, but I went down the\nglen--what's that they call it? the Garple Dean--I got round the back\nwhere the old ruin stands and I had a good look at the House. I tell you\nthere was somebody in it.\"\n\n\"It would be Spittal, who acts as caretaker.\"\n\n\"It was not. It was a woman. I saw her on the verandah.\"\n\nThe candid grey eyes were looking straight at Dickson, who managed to\nbring his own shy orbs to meet them. He thought that he detected a shade\nof hesitation. Then Mr. Loudon got up from his chair and stood on the\nhearthrug looking down at his visitor. He laughed, with some\nembarrassment, but ever so pleasantly.\n\n\"I really don't know what you will think of me, Mr. McCunn. Here are\nyou, coming to do us all a kindness, and lease that infernal white\nelephant, and here have I been steadily hoaxing you for the last five\nminutes. I humbly ask your pardon. Set it down to the loyalty of an old\nfamily lawyer. Now, I am going to tell you the truth and take you into\nour confidence, for I know we are safe with you. The Kennedys\nare--always have been--just a wee bit queer. Old inbred stock, you know.\nThey will produce somebody like poor Mr. Quentin, who was as sane as you\nor me, but as a rule in every generation there is one member of the\nfamily--or more--who is just a little bit----\" and he tapped his\nforehead. \"Nothing violent, you understand, but just not quite 'wise and\nworld-like,' as the old folk say. Well, there's a certain old lady, an\naunt of Mr. Quentin and his sisters, who has always been about tenpence\nin the shilling. Usually she lives at Bournemouth, but one of her crazes\nis a passion for Huntingtower, and the Kennedys have always humoured her\nand had her to stay every spring. When the House was shut up that became\nimpossible, but this year she took such a craving to come back, that\nLady Morewood asked me to arrange it. It had to be kept very quiet, but\nthe poor old thing is perfectly harmless, and just sits and knits with\nher maid and looks out of the seaward windows. Now you see why I can't\ntake you there to-morrow. I have to get rid of the old lady, who in any\ncase was travelling south early next week. Do you understand?\"\n\n\"Perfectly,\" said Dickson with some fervour. He had learned exactly what\nhe wanted. The factor was telling him lies. Now he knew where to place\nMr. Loudon.\n\nHe always looked back upon what followed as a very creditable piece of\nplay-acting for a man who had small experience in that line.\n\n\"Is the old lady a wee wizened body, with a black cap and something like\na white cashmere shawl round her shoulders?\"\n\n\"You describe her exactly,\" Mr. Loudon replied eagerly.\n\n\"That would explain the foreigners.\"\n\n\"Of course. We couldn't have natives who would make the thing the clash\nof the countryside.\"\n\n\"Of course not. But it must be a difficult job to keep a business like\nthat quiet. Any wandering policeman might start inquiries. And supposing\nthe lady became violent?\"\n\n\"Oh, there's no fear of that. Besides, I've a position in this\ncounty--Deputy Fiscal and so forth--and a friend of the Chief Constable.\nI think I may be trusted to do a little private explaining if the need\narose.\"\n\n\"I see,\" said Dickson. He saw, indeed, a great deal which would give him\nfood for furious thought. \"Well, I must just possess my soul in\npatience. Here's my Glasgow address, and I look to you to send me a\ntelegram whenever you're ready for me. I'm at the Salutation to-night,\nand go home to-morrow with the first train. Wait a minute\"--and he\npulled out his watch--\"there's a train stops at Auchenlochan at 10.17. I\nthink I'll catch that.... Well, Mr. Loudon, I'm very much obliged to\nyou, and I'm glad to think that it'll no be long till we renew our\nacquaintance.\"\n\nThe factor accompanied him to the door, diffusing geniality. \"Very\npleased indeed to have met you. A pleasant journey and a quick return.\"\n\nThe street was still empty. Into a corner of the arches opposite the\nmoon was shining, and Dickson retired thither to consult his map of the\nneighbourhood. He found what he wanted and, as he lifted his eyes,\ncaught sight of a man coming down the causeway. Promptly he retired into\nthe shadow and watched the new-comer. There could be no mistake about\nthe figure; the bulk, the walk, the carriage of the head marked it for\nDobson. The inn-keeper went slowly past the factor's house; then halted\nand retraced his steps; then, making sure that the street was empty,\nturned into the side lane which led to the garden.\n\nThis was what sailors call a cross-bearing, and strengthened Dickson's\nconviction. He delayed no longer, but hurried down the side street by\nwhich the north road leaves the town.\n\nHe had crossed the bridge of Lochan and was climbing the steep ascent\nwhich led to the heathy plateau separating that stream from the Garple\nbefore he had got his mind quite clear on the case. _First_, Loudon was\nin the plot, whatever it was; responsible for the details of the girl's\nimprisonment, but not the main author. That must be the Unknown who was\nstill to come, from whom Spidel took his orders. Dobson was probably\nLoudon's special henchman, working directly under him. _Secondly_, the\nimmediate object had been the jewels, and they were happily safe in the\nvaults of the incorruptible Mackintosh. But, _third_--and this only on\nSaskia's evidence--the worst danger to her began with the arrival of the\nUnknown. What could that be? Probably, kidnapping. He was prepared to\nbelieve anything of people like Bolsheviks. And, _fourth_, this danger\nwas due within the next day or two. Loudon had been quite willing to let\nhim into the house and to sack all the watchers within a week from that\ndate. The natural and right thing was to summon the aid of the law,\nbut, _fifth_, that would be a slow business with Loudon able to put\nspokes in the wheels and befog the authorities, and the mischief would\nbe done before a single policeman showed his face in Dalquharter.\nTherefore, _sixth_, he and Heritage must hold the fort in the meantime,\nand he would send a wire to his lawyer, Mr. Caw, to get to work with the\nconstabulary. _Seventh_, he himself was probably free from suspicion in\nboth Loudon's and Dobson's minds as a harmless fool. But that freedom\nwould not survive his reappearance in Dalquharter. He could say, to be\nsure, that he had come back to see his auntie, but that would not\nsatisfy the watchers, since, so far as they knew, he was the only man\noutside the gang who was aware that people were dwelling in the House.\nThey would not tolerate his presence in the neighbourhood.\n\nHe formulated his conclusions as if it were an ordinary business deal,\nand rather to his surprise was not conscious of any fear. As he pulled\ntogether the belt of his waterproof he felt the reassuring bulges in its\npockets which were his pistol and cartridges. He reflected that it must\nbe very difficult to miss with a pistol if you fired it at, say, three\nyards, and if there was to be shooting that would be his range. Mr.\nMcCunn had stumbled on the precious truth that the best way to be rid of\nquaking knees is to keep a busy mind.\n\nHe crossed the ridge of the plateau and looked down on the Garple glen.\nThere were the lights of Dalquharter--or rather a single light, for the\ninhabitants went early to bed. His intention was to seek quarters with\nMrs. Morran, when his eye caught a gleam in a hollow of the moor a\nlittle to the east. He knew it for the camp-fire around which Dougal's\nwarriors bivouacked. The notion came to him to go there instead, and\nhear the news of the day before entering the cottage. So he crossed the\nbridge, skirted a plantation of firs, and scrambled through the broom\nand heather in what he took to be the right direction.\n\nThe moon had gone down, and the quest was not easy. Dickson had come to\nthe conclusion that he was on the wrong road, when he was summoned by a\nvoice which seemed to arise out of the ground.\n\n\"Who goes there?\"\n\n\"What's that you say?\"\n\n\"Who goes there?\" The point of a pole was held firmly against his chest.\n\n\"I'm Mr. McCunn, a friend of Dougal's.\"\n\n\"Stand, friend.\" The shadow before him whistled and another shadow\nappeared. \"Report to the Chief that there's a man here, name o' McCunn,\nseekin' for him.\"\n\nPresently the messenger returned with Dougal and a cheap lantern which\nhe flashed in Dickson's face.\n\n\"Oh, it's you,\" said that leader, who had his jaw bound up as if he had\nthe toothache. \"What are ye doing back here?\"\n\n\"To tell the truth, Dougal,\" was the answer, \"I couldn't stay away. I\nwas fair miserable when I thought of Mr. Heritage and you laddies left\nto yourselves. My conscience simply wouldn't let me stop at home, so\nhere I am.\"\n\nDougal grunted, but clearly he approved, for from that moment he treated\nDickson with a new respect. Formerly when he had referred to him at all\nit had been as \"auld McCunn.\" Now it was \"Mister McCunn.\" He was given\nrank as a worthy civilian ally.\n\nThe bivouac was a cheerful place in the wet night. A great fire of pine\nroots and old paling posts hissed in the fine rain, and around it\ncrouched several urchins busy making oatmeal cakes in the embers. On one\nside a respectable lean-to had been constructed by nailing a plank to\ntwo fir-trees, running sloping poles thence to the ground, and thatching\nthe whole with spruce branches and heather. On the other side two small\ndilapidated home-made tents were pitched. Dougal motioned his companion\ninto the lean-to, where they had some privacy from the rest of the band.\n\n\"Well, what's your news?\" Dickson asked. He noticed that the Chieftain\nseemed to have been comprehensively in the wars, for apart from the\nbandage on his jaw, he had numerous small cuts on his brow, and a great\nrent in one of his shirt sleeves. Also he appeared to be going lame, and\nwhen he spoke a new gap was revealed in his large teeth.\n\n\"Things,\" said Dougal solemnly, \"has come to a bonny cripus. This very\nnight we've been in a battle.\"\n\nHe spat fiercely, and the light of war burned in his eyes.\n\n\"It was the tinklers from the Garple Dean. They yokit on us about seven\no'clock, just at the darkenin'. First they tried to bounce us. We\nweren't wanted here, they said, so we'd better clear. I telled them that\nit was them that wasn't wanted. 'Awa' to Finnick,' says I. 'D'ye think\nwe take our orders from dirty ne'er-do-weels like you?' 'By God,' says\nthey, 'we'll cut your lights out,' and then the battle started.\"\n\n\"What happened?\" Dickson asked excitedly.\n\n\"They were four muckle men against six laddies, and they thought they\nhad an easy job! Little they kenned the Gorbals Die-Hards! I had been\nexpectin' something of the kind, and had made my plans. They first tried\nto pu' down our tents and burn them. I let them get within five yards,\nreservin' my fire. The first volley--stones from our hands and our\ncatties--halted them, and before they could recover three of us had got\nhold o' burnin' sticks frae the fire and were lammin' into them. We\nkinnled their claes, and they fell back swearin' and stampin' to get the\nfire out. Then I gave the word and we were on them wi' our poles, usin'\nthe points accordin' to instructions. My orders was to keep a good\ndistance, for if they had grippit one o' us he'd ha' been done for. They\nwere roarin' mad by now, and twae had out their knives, but they\ncouldn't do muckle, for it was gettin' dark, and they didn't ken the\nground like us, and were aye trippin' and tumblin'. But they pressed us\nhard, and one o' them landed me an awful clype on the jaw. They were\nstill aiming at our tents, and I saw that if they got near the fire\nagain it would be the end o' us. So I blew my whistle for Thomas Yownie,\nwho was in command o' the other half of us, with instructions to fall\nupon their rear. That brought Thomas up, and the tinklers had to face\nround about and fight a battle on two fronts. We charged them and they\nbroke, and the last seen o' them they were coolin' their burns in the\nGarple.\"\n\n\"Well done, man. Had you many casualties?\"\n\n\"We're a' a wee thing battered, but nothing to hurt. I'm the worst, for\none o' them had a grip o' me for about three seconds, and Gosh! he was\nfierce.\"\n\n\"They're beaten off for the night, anyway?\"\n\n\"Ay, for the night. But they'll come back, never fear. That's why I said\nthat things had come to a cripus.\"\n\n\"What's the news from the House?\"\n\n\"A quiet day, and no word o' Lean or Dobson.\"\n\nDickson nodded. \"They were hunting me.\"\n\n\"Mr. Heritage has gone to bide in the Hoose. They were watchin' the\nGarple Dean, so I took him round by the Laver foot and up the rocks.\nHe's a grand climber, yon. We fund a road up the rocks and got in by the\nverandy. Did ye ken that the lassie had a pistol? Well, she has, and it\nseems that Mr. Heritage is a good shot wi' a pistol, so there's some\nhope thereaways.... Are the jools safe?\"\n\n\"Safe in the bank. But the jools were not the main thing.\"\n\nDougal nodded. \"So I was thinkin'. The lassie wasn't muckle the easier\nfor gettin' rid o' them. I didn't just quite understand what she said to\nMr. Heritage, for they were aye wanderin' into foreign langwidges, but\nit seems she's terrible feared o' somebody that may turn up any moment.\nWhat's the reason I can't say. She's maybe got a secret, or maybe it's\njust that she's ower bonny.\"\n\n\"That's the trouble,\" said Dickson and proceeded to recount his\ninterview with the factor, to which Dougal gave close attention. \"Now\nthe way I read the thing is this. There's a plot to kidnap that lady,\nfor some infernal purpose, and it depends on the arrival of some person\nor persons, and it's due to happen in the next day or two. If we try to\nwork it through the police alone, they'll beat us, for Loudon will\nmanage to hang the business up till it's too late. So we must take up\nthe job ourselves. We must stand a siege, Mr. Heritage and me and you\nladdies, and for that purpose we'd better all keep together. It won't be\nextra easy to carry her off from all of us, and if they do manage it\nwe'll stick to their heels.... Man, Dougal, isn't it a queer thing that\nwhiles law-abiding folk have to make their own laws?... So my plan is\nthat the lot of us get into the House and form a garrison. If you don't,\nthe tinklers will come back and you'll no' beat them in the daylight.\"\n\n\"I doubt no',\" said Dougal. \"But what about our meat?\"\n\n\"We must lay in provisions. We'll get what we can from Mrs. Morran, and\nI've left a big box of fancy things at Dalquharter station. Can you\nladdies manage to get it down here?\"\n\nDougal reflected. \"Ay, we can hire Mrs. Sempill's powny, the same that\nfetched our kit.\"\n\n\"Well, that's your job to-morrow. See, I'll write you a line to the\nstation-master. And will you undertake to get it some way into the\nHouse?\"\n\n\"There's just the one road open--by the rocks. It'll have to be done. It\n_can_ be done.\"\n\n\"And I've another job. I'm writing this telegram to a friend in Glasgow\nwho will put a spoke in Mr. Loudon's wheel. I want one of you to go to\nKirkmichael to send it from the telegraph office there.\"\n\nDougal placed the wire to Mr. Caw in his bosom. \"What about yourself? We\nwant somebody outside to keep his eyes open. It's bad strawtegy to cut\noff your communications.\"\n\nDickson thought for a moment. \"I believe you're right. I believe the\nbest plan for me is to go back to Mrs. Morran's as soon as the old\nbody's like to be awake. You can always get at me there, for it's easy\nto slip into her back kitchen without anybody in the village seeing\nyou.... Yes, I'll do that, and you'll come and report developments to\nme. And now I'm for a bite and a pipe. It's hungry work travelling the\ncountry in the small hours.\"\n\n\"I'm going to introjuice ye to the rest o' us,\" said Dougal. \"Here,\nmen!\" he called, and four figures rose from the side of the fire. As\nDickson munched a sandwich he passed in review the whole company of the\nGorbals Die-Hards, for the pickets were also brought in, two others\ntaking their places. There was Thomas Yownie, the Chief of Staff, with a\nwrist wound up in the handkerchief which he had borrowed from his neck.\nThere was a burly lad who wore trousers much too large for him, and who\nwas known as Peer Pairson, a contraction presumably for Peter Paterson.\nAfter him came a lean tall boy who answered to the name of Napoleon.\nThere was a midget of a child, desperately sooty in the face either from\nbattle or from fire-tending, who was presented as Wee Jaikie. Last came\nthe picket who had held his pole at Dickson's chest, a sandy-haired\nwarrior with a snub nose and the mouth and jaw of a pug-dog. He was Old\nBill, or in Dougal's parlance \"Auld Bull.\"\n\nThe Chieftain viewed his scarred following with a grim content. \"That's\na tough lot for ye, Mr. McCunn. Used a' their days wi' sleepin' in\ncoalrees and dunnies and dodgin' the polis. Ye'll no beat the Gorbals\nDie-Hards.\"\n\n\"You're right, Dougal,\" said Dickson. \"There's just the six of you. If\nthere were a dozen, I think this country would be needing some new kind\nof a government.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nHOW A MIDDLE-AGED CRUSADER ACCEPTED A CHALLENGE\n\n\nThe first cocks had just begun to crow and the clocks had not yet struck\nfive when Dickson presented himself at Mrs. Morran's back door. That\nactive woman had already been half an hour out of bed, and was drinking\nher morning cup of tea in the kitchen. She received him with cordiality,\nnay, with relief.\n\n\"Eh, sirs, but I'm glad to see ye back. Guid kens what's gaun on at the\nHoose thae days. Mr. Heritage left here yestreen, creepin' round by\ndyke-sides and berry-busses like a wheasel. It's a mercy to get a\nresponsible man in the place. I aye had a notion ye wad come back, for,\nthinks I, nevoy Dickson is no the yin to desert folk in trouble....\nWhaur's my wee kist?... Lost, ye say. That's a peety, for it's been my\ncheese-box thae thirty year.\"\n\nDickson ascended to the loft, having announced his need of at least\nthree hours' sleep. As he rolled into bed his mind was curiously at\nease. He felt equipped for any call that might be made on him. That Mrs.\nMorran should welcome him back as a resource in need gave him a new\nassurance of manhood.\n\nHe woke between nine and ten to the sound of rain lashing against the\ngarret window. As he picked his way out of the mazes of sleep and\nrecovered the skein of his immediate past, he found to his disgust that\nhe had lost his composure. All the flock of fears that had left him\nwhen, on the top of the Glasgow tram-car, he had made the great decision\nhad flown back again and settled like black crows on his spirit. He was\nrunning a horrible risk and all for a whim. What business had he to be\nmixing himself up in things he did not understand? It might be a huge\nmistake, and then he would be a laughing stock; for a moment he repented\nhis telegram to Mr. Caw. Then he recanted that suspicion; there could be\nno mistake, except the fatal one that he had taken on a job too big for\nhim. He sat on the edge of his bed and shivered, with his eyes on the\ngrey drift of rain. He would have felt more stout-hearted had the sun\nbeen shining.\n\nHe shuffled to the window and looked out. There in the village street\nwas Dobson, and Dobson saw him. That was a bad blunder, for his reason\ntold him that he should have kept his presence in Dalquharter hid as\nlong as possible.\n\nThere was a knock at the cottage door, and presently Mrs. Morran\nappeared.\n\n\"It's the man frae the inn,\" she announced. \"He's wantin' a word wi' ye.\nSpeakin' verra ceevil, too.\"\n\n\"Tell him to come up,\" said Dickson. He might as well get the interview\nover. Dobson had seen Loudon and must know of their conversation. The\nsight of himself back again when he had pretended to be off to Glasgow\nwould remove him effectually from the class of the unsuspected. He\nwondered just what line Dobson would take.\n\nThe innkeeper obtruded his bulk through the low door. His face was\nwrinkled into a smile, which nevertheless left the small eyes ungenial.\nHis voice had a loud vulgar cordiality. Suddenly Dickson was conscious\nof a resemblance, a resemblance to somebody whom he had recently seen.\nIt was Loudon. There was the same thrusting of the chin forward, the\nsame odd cheek-bones, the same unctuous heartiness of speech. The\ninnkeeper, well washed and polished and dressed, would be no bad copy of\nthe factor. They must be near kin, perhaps brothers.\n\n\"Good morning to you, Mr. McCunn. Man, it's pitifu' weather, and just\nwhen the farmers are wanting a dry seed-bed. What brings ye back here?\nYe travel the country like a drover.\"\n\n\"Oh, I'm a free man now and I took a fancy to this place. An idle body\nhas nothing to do but please himself.\"\n\n\"I hear ye're taking a lease of Huntingtower?\"\n\n\"Now who told you that?\"\n\n\"Just the clash of the place. Is it true?\"\n\nDickson looked sly and a little annoyed.\n\n\"I maybe had half a thought of it, but I'll thank you not to repeat the\nstory. It's a big house for a plain man like me, and I haven't properly\ninspected it.\"\n\n\"Oh, I'll keep mum, never fear. But if ye've that sort of notion, I can\nunderstand you not being able to keep away from the place.\"\n\n\"That's maybe the fact,\" Dickson admitted.\n\n\"Well! It's just on that point I want a word with you.\" The innkeeper\nseated himself unbidden on the chair which held Dickson's modest\nraiment. He leaned forward and with a coarse forefinger tapped Dickson's\npyjama-clad knees. \"I can't have ye wandering about the place. I'm very\nsorry, but I've got my orders from Mr. Loudon. So if you think that by\nbidin' here ye can see more of the House and the policies, ye're wrong,\nMr. McCunn. It can't be allowed, for we're no' ready for ye yet. D'ye\nunderstand? That's Mr. Loudon's orders.... Now, would it not be a far\nbetter plan if ye went back to Glasgow and came back in a week's time?\nI'm thinking of your own comfort, Mr. McCunn.\"\n\nDickson was cogitating hard. This man was clearly instructed to get rid\nof him at all costs for the next few days. The neighbourhood had to be\ncleared for some black business. The tinklers had been deputed to drive\nout the Gorbals Die-Hards, and as for Heritage they seemed to have lost\ntrack of him. He, Dickson, was now the chief object of their care. But\nwhat could Dobson do if he refused? He dared not show his true hand. Yet\nhe might, if sufficiently irritated. It became Dickson's immediate\nobject to get the innkeeper to reveal himself by rousing his temper. He\ndid not stop to consider the policy of this course; he imperatively\nwanted things cleared up and the issue made plain.\n\n\"I'm sure I'm much obliged to you for thinking so much about my\ncomfort,\" he said in a voice into which he hoped he had insinuated a\nsneer. \"But I'm bound to say you're awful suspicious folk about here.\nYou needn't be feared for your old policies. There's plenty of nice\nwalks about the roads, and I want to explore the sea-coast.\"\n\nThe last words seemed to annoy the innkeeper. \"That's no' allowed\neither,\" he said. \"The shore's as private as the policies.... Well, I\nwish ye joy tramping the roads in the glaur.\"\n\n\"It's a queer thing,\" said Dickson meditatively, \"that you should keep\nan hotel and yet be set on discouraging people from visiting this\nneighbourhood. I tell you what, I believe that hotel of yours is all\nsham. You've some other business, you and these lodgekeepers, and in my\nopinion it's not a very creditable one.\"\n\n\"What d'ye mean?\" asked Dobson sharply.\n\n\"Just what I say. You must expect a body to be suspicious, if you treat\nhim as you're treating me.\" Loudon must have told this man the story\nwith which he had been fobbed off about the half-witted Kennedy\nrelative. Would Dobson refer to that?\n\nThe innkeeper had an ugly look on his face, but he controlled his temper\nwith an effort. \"There's no cause for suspicion,\" he said. \"As far as\nI'm concerned it's all honest and aboveboard.\"\n\n\"It doesn't look like it. It looks as if you were hiding something up in\nthe House which you don't want me to see.\"\n\nDobson jumped from his chair, his face pale with anger. A man in pyjamas\non a raw morning does not feel at his bravest, and Dickson quailed under\nthe expectation of assault. But even in his fright he realised that\nLoudon could not have told Dobson the tale of the half-witted lady. The\nlast remark had cut clean through all camouflage and reached the quick.\n\n\"What the hell d' ye mean?\" he cried. \"Ye're a spy, are ye? Ye fat\nlittle fool, for two cents I'd wring your neck.\"\n\nNow it is an odd trait of certain mild people that a suspicion of\nthreat, a hint of bullying, will rouse some unsuspected obstinacy deep\ndown in their souls. The insolence of the man's speech woke a quiet but\nefficient little devil in Dickson.\n\n\"That's a bonny tone to adopt in addressing a gentleman. If you've\nnothing to hide what way are you so touchy? I can't be a spy unless\nthere's something to spy on.\"\n\nThe innkeeper pulled himself together. He was apparently acting on\ninstructions, and had not yet come to the end of them. He made an\nattempt at a smile.\n\n\"I'm sure I beg your pardon if I spoke too hot. But it nettled me to\nhear ye say that.... I'll be quite frank with ye, Mr. McCunn, and,\nbelieve me, I'm speaking in your best interests. I give ye my word\nthere's nothing wrong up at the House. I'm on the side of the law, and\nwhen I tell ye the whole story ye'll admit it. But I can't tell it ye\nyet.... This is a wild, lonely bit and very few folk bide in it. And\nthese are wild times, when a lot of queer things happen that never get\ninto the papers. I tell ye it's for your own good to leave Dalquharter\nfor the present. More I can't say, but I ask ye to look at it as a\nsensible man. Ye're one that's accustomed to a quiet life and no' meant\nfor rough work. Ye'll do no good if you stay, and, maybe, ye'll land\nyourself in bad trouble.\"\n\n\"Mercy on us!\" Dickson exclaimed. \"What is it you're expecting? Sinn\nFein?\"\n\nThe innkeeper nodded. \"Something like that.\"\n\n\"Did you ever hear the like? I never did think much of the Irish.\"\n\n\"Then ye'll take my advice and go home? Tell ye what, I'll drive ye to\nthe station.\"\n\nDickson got up from the bed, found his new safety-razor and began to\nstrop it. \"No, I think I'll bide. If you're right there'll be more to\nsee than glaury roads.\"\n\n\"I'm warning ye, fair and honest. Ye ... can't ... be ... allowed ... to\n... stay ... here!\"\n\n\"Well, I never!\" said Dickson. \"Is there any law in Scotland, think you,\nthat forbids a man to stop a day or two with his auntie?\"\n\n\"Ye'll stay?\"\n\n\"Ay, I'll stay.\"\n\n\"By God, we'll see about that.\"\n\nFor a moment Dickson thought that he would be attacked, and he measured\nthe distance that separated him from the peg whence hung his waterproof\nwith the pistol in its pocket. But the man restrained himself and moved\nto the door. There he stood and cursed him with a violence and a venom\nwhich Dickson had not believed possible. The full hand was on the table\nnow.\n\n\"Ye wee pot-bellied, pig-heided Glasgow grocer,\" (I paraphrase), \"would\n_you_ set up to defy me? I tell ye, I'll make ye rue the day ye were\nborn.\" His parting words were a brilliant sketch of the maltreatment in\nstore for the body of the defiant one.\n\n\"Impident dog,\" said Dickson without heat. He noted with pleasure that\nthe innkeeper hit his head violently against the low lintel, and,\nmissing a step, fell down the loft stairs into the kitchen, where Mrs.\nMorran's tongue could be heard speeding him trenchantly from the\npremises.\n\nLeft to himself, Dickson dressed leisurely, and by and by went down to\nthe kitchen and watched his hostess making broth. The fracas with Dobson\nhad done him all the good in the world, for it had cleared the problem\nof dubieties and had put an edge on his temper. But he realised that it\nmade his continued stay in the cottage undesirable. He was now the focus\nof all suspicion, and the innkeeper would be as good as his word and try\nto drive him out of the place by force. Kidnapping, most likely, and\nthat would be highly unpleasant, besides putting an end to his\nusefulness. Clearly he must join the others. The soul of Dickson\nhungered at the moment for human companionship. He felt that his courage\nwould be sufficient for any team-work, but might waver again if he were\nleft to play a lone hand.\n\nHe lunched nobly off three plates of Mrs. Morran's kail--an early lunch,\nfor that lady, having breakfasted at five, partook of the midday meal\nabout eleven. Then he explored her library, and settled himself by the\nfire with a volume of Covenanting tales, entitled _Gleanings among the\nMountains_. It was a most practical work for one in his position, for it\ntold how various eminent saints of that era escaped the attention of\nClaverhouse's dragoons. Dickson stored up in his memory several of the\nincidents in case they should come in handy. He wondered if any of his\nforbears had been Covenanters; it comforted him to think that some old\nprogenitor might have hunkered behind turf walls and been chased for his\nlife in the heather. \"Just like me,\" he reflected. \"But the dragoons\nweren't foreigners, and there was a kind of decency about Claverhouse\ntoo.\"\n\nAbout four o'clock Dougal presented himself in the back kitchen. He was\nan even wilder figure than usual, for his bare legs were mud to the\nknees, his kilt and shirt clung sopping to his body, and, having lost\nhis hat, his wet hair was plastered over his eyes. Mrs. Morran said, not\nunkindly, that he looked \"like a wull-cat glowerin' through a whin\nbuss.\"\n\n\"How are you, Dougal?\" Dickson asked genially. \"Is the peace of nature\nsmoothing out the creases in your poor little soul?\"\n\n\"What's that ye say?\"\n\n\"Oh, just what I heard a man say in Glasgow. How have you got on?\"\n\n\"Not so bad. Your telegram was sent this mornin'. Old Bill took it in to\nKirkmichael. That's the first thing. Second, Thomas Yownie has took a\nparty to get down the box from the station. He got Mrs. Sempill's powny\nand he took the box ayont the Laver by the ford at the herd's hoose and\ngot it on to the shore maybe a mile ayont Laverfoot. He managed to get\nthe machine up as far as the water, but he could get no farther, for\nye'll no' get a machine over the wee waterfa' just before the Laver ends\nin the sea. So he sent one o' the men back with it to Mrs. Sempill, and,\nsince the box was ower heavy to carry, he opened it and took the stuff\nacross in bits. It's a' safe in the hole at the foot o' the Huntingtower\nrocks, and he reports that the rain has done it no harm. Thomas has made\na good job of it. Ye'll no fickle Thomas Yownie.\"\n\n\"And what about your camp on the moor?\"\n\n\"It was broke up afore daylight. Some of our things we've got with us,\nand most is hid near at hand. The tents are in the auld wife's\nhenhoose,\" and he jerked his disreputable head in the direction of the\nback door.\n\n\"Have the tinklers been back?\"\n\n\"Ay. They turned up about ten o'clock, no doubt intendin' murder. I left\nWee Jaikie to watch developments. They fund him sittin' on a stone,\ngreetin' sore. When he saw them, he up and started to run, and they\ncried on him to stop, but he wouldn't listen. Then they cried out where\nwere the rest, and he telled them they were feared for their lives and\nhad run away. After that they offered to catch him, but ye'll no' catch\nJaikie in a hurry. When he had run round about them till they were\nwappit, he out wi' his catty and got one o' them on the lug. Syne he\nmade for the Laverfoot and reported.\"\n\n\"Man, Dougal, you've managed fine. Now I've something to tell you,\" and\nDickson recounted his interview with the innkeeper. \"I don't think it's\nsafe for me to bide here, and if I did, I wouldn't be any use, hiding in\ncellars and such like, and not daring to stir a foot. I'm coming with\nyou to the House. Now tell me how to get there.\"\n\nDougal agreed to this view. \"There's been nothing doing at the Hoose the\nday, but they're keepin' a close watch on the policies. The cripus may\ncome any moment. There's no doubt, Mr. McCunn, that ye're in danger, for\nthey'll serve you as the tinklers tried to serve us. Listen to me. Ye'll\nwalk up the station road, and take the second turn on your left, a wee\ngrass road that'll bring ye to the ford at the herd's hoose. Cross the\nLaver--there's a plank bridge--and take straight across the moor in the\ndirection of the peakit hill they call Grey Carrick. Ye'll come to a big\nburn, which ye must follow till ye get to the shore. Then turn south,\nkeepin' the water's edge till ye reach the Laver, where you'll find one\no' us to show ye the rest of the road.... I must be off now, and I\nadvise ye not to be slow of startin', for wi' this rain the water's\nrisin' quick. It's a mercy it's such coarse weather, for it spoils the\nveesibility.\"\n\n\"Auntie Phemie,\" said Dickson a few minutes later, \"will you oblige me\nby coming for a short walk?\"\n\n\"The man's daft,\" was the answer.\n\n\"I'm not. I'll explain if you'll listen.... You see,\" he concluded, \"the\ndangerous bit for me is just the mile out of the village. They'll no' be\nso likely to try violence if there's somebody with me that could be a\nwitness. Besides, they'll maybe suspect less if they just see a decent\nbody out for a breath of air with his auntie.\"\n\nMrs. Morran said nothing, but retired, and returned presently equipped\nfor the road. She had indued her feet with goloshes and pinned up her\nskirts till they looked like some demented Paris mode. An ancient bonnet\nwas tied under her chin with strings, and her equipment was completed by\nan exceedingly smart tortoise-shell-handled umbrella, which, she\nexplained, had been a Christmas present from her son.\n\n\"I'll convoy ye as far as the Laverfoot herd's,\" she announced. \"The\nwife's a freend o' mine and will set me a bit on the road back. Ye\nneedna fash for me. I'm used to a' weathers.\"\n\nThe rain had declined to a fine drizzle, but a tearing wind from the\nsouth-west scoured the land. Beyond the shelter of the trees the moor\nwas a battle-ground of gusts which swept the puddles into spindrift and\ngave to the stagnant bog-pools the appearance of running water. The wind\nwas behind the travellers, and Mrs. Morran, like a full-rigged ship,\nwas hustled before it, so that Dickson, who had linked arms with her,\nwas sometimes compelled to trot.\n\n\"However will you get home, mistress?\" he murmured anxiously.\n\n\"Fine. The wind will fa' at the darkenin'. This'll be a sair time for\nships at sea.\"\n\nNot a soul was about, as they breasted the ascent of the station road\nand turned down the grassy bypath to the Laverfoot herd's. The herd's\nwife saw them from afar and was at the door to receive them.\n\n\"Megsty! Phemie Morran!\" she shrilled. \"Wha wad ettle to see ye on a day\nlike this? John's awa' at Dumfries, buyin' tups. Come in, the baith o'\nye. The kettle's on the boil.\"\n\n\"This is my nevoy Dickson,\" said Mrs. Morran. \"He's gaun to stretch his\nlegs ayont the burn, and come back by the Ayr road. But I'll be blithe\nto tak' my tea wi' ye, Elspeth.... Now, Dickson, I'll expect ye back on\nthe chap o' seeven.\"\n\nHe crossed the rising stream on a swaying plank and struck into the\nmoorland, as Dougal had ordered, keeping the bald top of Grey Carrick\nbefore him. In that wild place with the tempest battling overhead he had\nno fear of human enemies. Steadily he covered the ground, till he\nreached the west-flowing burn that was to lead him to the shore. He\nfound it an entertaining companion, swirling into black pools, foaming\nover little falls, and lying in dark canal-like stretches in the flats.\nPresently it began to descend steeply in a narrow green gully, where\nthe going was bad, and Dickson, weighted with pack and waterproof, had\nmuch ado to keep his feet on the sodden slopes. Then, as he rounded a\ncrook of hill, the ground fell away from his feet, the burn swept in a\nwater-slide to the boulders of the shore, and the storm-tossed sea lay\nbefore him.\n\nIt was now that he began to feel nervous. Being on the coast again\nseemed to bring him inside his enemies' territory, and had not Dobson\nspecifically forbidden the shore? It was here that they might be looking\nfor him. He felt himself out of condition, very wet and very warm, but\nhe attained a creditable pace, for he struck a road which had been used\nby manure-carts collecting seaweed. There were faint marks on it, which\nhe took to be the wheels of Dougal's \"machine\" carrying the\nprovision-box. Yes. On a patch of gravel there was a double set of\ntracks, which showed how it had returned to Mrs. Sempill. He was exposed\nto the full force of the wind, and the strenuousness of his bodily\nexertions kept his fears quiescent, till the cliffs on his left sunk\nsuddenly and the valley of the Laver lay before him.\n\nA small figure rose from the shelter of a boulder, the warrior who bore\nthe name of Old Bill. He saluted gravely.\n\n\"Ye're just in time. The water has rose three inches since I've been\nhere. Ye'd better strip.\"\n\nDickson removed his boots and socks. \"Breeks, too,\" commanded the boy;\n\"there's deep holes ayont thae stanes.\"\n\nDickson obeyed, feeling very chilly, and rather improper. \"Now, follow\nme,\" said the guide. The next moment he was stepping delicately on very\nsharp pebbles, holding on to the end of the scout's pole, while an icy\nstream ran to his knees.\n\nThe Laver as it reaches the sea broadens out to the width of fifty or\nsixty yards and tumbles over little shelves of rock to meet the waves.\nUsually it is shallow, but now it was swollen to an average depth of a\nfoot or more, and there were deeper pockets. Dickson made the passage\nslowly and miserably, sometimes crying out with pain as his toes struck\na sharper flint, once or twice sitting down on a boulder to blow like a\nwhale, once slipping on his knees and wetting the strange excrescence\nabout his middle, which was his tucked-up waterproof. But the crossing\nwas at length achieved, and on a patch of sea-pinks he dried himself\nperfunctorily and hastily put on his garments. Old Bill, who seemed to\nbe regardless of wind or water, squatted beside him and whistled through\nhis teeth.\n\nAbove them hung the sheer cliffs of the Huntingtower cape, so sheer that\na man below was completely hidden from any watcher on the top. Dickson's\nheart fell, for he did not profess to be a cragsman and had indeed a\nhorror of precipitous places. But as the two scrambled along the foot,\nthey passed deep-cut gullies and fissures, most of them unclimbable, but\noffering something more hopeful than the face. At one of these Old Bill\nhalted and led the way up and over a chaos of fallen rock and loose\nsand. The grey weather had brought on the dark prematurely, and in the\nhalf-light it seemed that this ravine was blocked by an unscalable mass\nof rock. Here Old Bill whistled, and there was a reply from above. Round\nthe corner of the mass came Dougal.\n\n\"Up here,\" he commanded. \"It was Mr. Heritage that fund this road.\"\n\nDickson and his guide squeezed themselves between the mass and the cliff\nup a spout of stones, and found themselves in an upper storey of the\ngulley, very steep but practicable even for one who was no cragsman.\nThis in turn ran out against a wall up which there led only a narrow\nchimney. At the foot of this were two of the Die-Hards, and there were\nothers above, for a rope hung down by the aid of which a package was\neven now ascending.\n\n\"That's the top,\" said Dougal, pointing to the rim of sky, \"and that's\nthe last o' the supplies.\" Dickson noticed that he spoke in a whisper,\nand that all the movements of the Die-Hards were judicious and stealthy.\n\"Now, it's your turn. Take a good grip o' the rope, and ye'll find\nplenty holes for your feet. It's no more than ten yards and ye're well\nheld above.\"\n\nDickson made the attempt and found it easier than he expected. The only\ntrouble was his pack and waterproof, which had a tendency to catch on\njags of rock. A hand was reached out to him, he was pulled over the\nedge, and then pushed down on his face.\n\nWhen he lifted his head Dougal and the others had joined him and the\nwhole company of the Die-Hards was assembled on a patch of grass which\nwas concealed from the landward view by a thicket of hazels. Another,\nwhom he recognised as Heritage, was coiling up the rope.\n\n\"We'd better get all the stuff into the old Tower for the present,\"\nHeritage was saying. \"It's too risky to move it into the House now.\nWe'll need the thickest darkness for that, after the moon is down.\nQuick, for the beastly thing will be rising soon and before that we must\nall be indoors.\"\n\nThen he turned to Dickson, and gripped his hand. \"You're a high class of\nsportsman, Dogson. And I think you're just in time.\"\n\n\"Are they due to-night?\" Dickson asked in an excited whisper, faint\nagainst the wind.\n\n\"I don't know about They. But I've got a notion that some devilish queer\nthings will happen before to-morrow morning.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nTHE FIRST BATTLE OF THE CRUIVES\n\n\nThe old keep of Huntingtower stood some three hundred yards from the\nedge of the cliffs, a gnarled wood of hazels and oaks protecting it from\nthe sea-winds. It was still in fair preservation, having till twenty\nyears before been an adjunct of the house of Dalquharter, and used as\nkitchen, buttery and servants' quarters. There had been residential\nwings attached, dating from the mid-eighteenth century, but these had\nbeen pulled down and used for the foundations of the new mansion. Now it\nstood a lonely shell, its three storeys, each a single great room\nconnected by a spiral stone staircase, being dedicated to lumber and the\nstorage of produce. But it was dry and intact, its massive oak doors\ndefied any weapon short of artillery, its narrow unglazed windows would\nscarcely have admitted a cat--a place portentously strong, gloomy, but\nyet habitable.\n\nDougal opened the main door with a massy key. \"The lassie fund it,\" he\nwhispered to Dickson, \"somewhere about the kitchen--and I guessed it was\nthe key o' this castle. I was thinkin' that if things got ower hot it\nwould be a good plan to flit here. Change our base, like.\" The\nChieftain's occasional studies in war had trained his tongue to a\nmilitary jargon.\n\nIn the ground room lay a fine assortment of oddments, including old\nbedsteads and servants' furniture, and what looked like ancient\ndiscarded deer-skin rugs. Dust lay thick over everything, and they heard\nthe scurry of rats. A dismal place, indeed, but Dickson felt only its\nstrangeness. The comfort of being back again among allies had quickened\nhis spirit to an adventurous mood. The old lords of Huntingtower had\nonce quarrelled and revelled and plotted here, and now here he was at\nthe same game. Present and past joined hands over the gulf of years. The\nsaga of Huntingtower was not ended.\n\nThe Die-Hards had brought with them their scanty bedding, their lanterns\nand camp kettles. These and the provisions from Mearns Street were\nstowed away in a corner.\n\n\"Now for the Hoose, men,\" said Dougal. They stole over the downs to the\nshrubbery, and Dickson found himself almost in the same place as he had\nlain in three days before, watching a dusky lawn, while the wet earth\nsoaked through his trouser knees and the drip from the azaleas trickled\nover his spine. Two of the boys fetched the ladder and placed it against\nthe verandah wall. Heritage first, then Dickson darted across the lawn\nand made the ascent. The six scouts followed, and the ladder was pulled\nup and hidden among the verandah litter. For a second the whole eight\nstood still and listened. There was no sound except the murmur of the\nnow falling wind and the melancholy hooting of owls. The garrison had\nentered the Dark Tower.\n\nA council in whispers was held in the garden room.\n\n\"Nobody must show a light,\" Heritage observed. \"It mustn't be known that\nwe're here. Only the Princess will have a lamp. Yes\"--this in answer to\nDickson, \"she knows that we're coming--you too. We'll hunt for quarters\nlater upstairs. You scouts, you must picket every possible entrance. The\nwindows are safe, I think, for they are locked from the inside. So is\nthe main door. But there's the verandah door, of which they have a key,\nand the back door beside the kitchen, and I'm not at all sure that\nthere's not a way in by the boiler-house. You understand. We're holding\nthis place against all comers. We must barricade the danger points. The\nheadquarters of the garrison will be in the hall, where a scout must be\nalways on duty. You've all got whistles? Well, if there's an attempt on\nthe verandah door the picket will whistle once, if at the back door\ntwice, if anywhere else three times, and it's everybody's duty, except\nthe picket who whistles, to get back to the hall for orders.\"\n\n\"That's so,\" assented Dougal.\n\n\"If the enemy forces an entrance we must overpower him. Any means you\nlike. Sticks or fists, and remember that if it's a scrap in the dark\nmake for the man's throat. I expect you little devils have eyes like\ncats. The scoundrels must be kept away from the ladies at all costs. If\nthe worst comes to the worst, the Princess has a revolver.\"\n\n\"So have I,\" said Dickson. \"I got it in Glasgow.\"\n\n\"The deuce you have! Can you use it?\"\n\n\"I don't know.\"\n\n\"Well, you can hand it over to me, if you like. But it oughtn't to come\nto shooting, if it's only the three of them. The eight of us should be\nable to manage three and one of them lame. If the others turn up--well,\nGod help us all! But we've got to make sure of one thing, that no one\nlays hands on the Princess so long as there's one of us left alive to\nhit out.\"\n\n\"Ye needn't be feared for that,\" said Dougal. There was no light in the\nroom, but Dickson was certain that the morose face of the Chieftain was\nlit with unholy joy.\n\n\"Then off with you. Mr. McCunn and I will explain matters to the\nladies.\"\n\nWhen they were alone, Heritage's voice took a different key. \"We're in\nfor it, Dogson, old man. There's no doubt these three scoundrels expect\nreinforcements at any moment, and with them will be one who is the devil\nincarnate. He's the only thing on earth that that brave girl fears. It\nseems he is in love with her and has pestered her for years. She hated\nthe sight of him, but he wouldn't take no, and being a powerful\nman--rich and well-born and all the rest of it--she had a desperate\ntime. I gather he was pretty high in favour with the old Court. Then\nwhen the Bolsheviks started he went over to them, like plenty of other\ngrandees, and now he's one of their chief brains--none of your callow\nrevolutionaries, but a man of the world, a kind of genius, she says, who\ncan hold his own anywhere. She believes him to be in this country, and\nonly waiting the right moment to turn up. Oh, it sounds ridiculous, I\nknow, in Britain in the twentieth century, but I learned in the war that\ncivilisation anywhere is a very thin crust. There are a hundred ways by\nwhich that kind of fellow could bamboozle all our law and police and\nspirit her away. That's the kind of crowd we have to face.\"\n\n\"Did she say what he was like in appearance?\"\n\n\"A face like an angel--a lost angel, she says.\"\n\nDickson suddenly had an inspiration.\n\n\"D'you mind the man you said was an Australian--at Kirkmichael? I\nthought myself he was a foreigner. Well, he was asking for a place he\ncalled Darkwater, and there's no sich place in the countryside. I\nbelieve he meant Dalquharter. I believe he's the man she's feared of.\"\n\nA gasped \"By Jove!\" came from the darkness. \"Dogson, you've hit it. That\nwas five days ago, and he must have got on the right trail by this time.\nHe'll be here to-night. That's why the three have been lying so quiet\nto-day. Well, we'll go through with it, even if we haven't a dog's\nchance. Only I'm sorry that you should be mixed up in such a hopeless\nbusiness.\"\n\n\"Why me more than you?\"\n\n\"Because it's all pure pride and joy for me to be here. Good God, I\nwouldn't be elsewhere for worlds. It's the great hour of my life. I\nwould gladly die for her.\"\n\n\"Tuts, that's no' the way to talk, man. Time enough to speak about dying\nwhen there's no other way out. I'm looking at this thing in a business\nway. We'd better be seeing the ladies.\"\n\nThey groped into the pitchy hall, somewhere in which a Die-Hard was on\npicket, and down the passage to the smoking-room. Dickson blinked in the\nlight of a very feeble lamp and Heritage saw that his hands were\ncumbered with packages. He deposited them on a sofa and made a ducking\nbow.\n\n\"I've come back, Mem, and glad to be back. Your jools are in safe\nkeeping, and not all the blagyirds in creation could get at them. I've\ncome to tell you to cheer up--a stout heart to a stey brae, as the old\nfolk say. I'm handling this affair as a business proposition, so don't\nbe feared, Mem. If there are enemies seeking you, there's friends on the\nroad too.... Now, you'll have had your dinner, but you'd maybe like a\nlittle dessert.\"\n\nHe spread before them a huge box of chocolates, the best that Mearns\nStreet could produce, a box of candied fruits, and another of salted\nalmonds. Then from his hideously overcrowded pockets he took another\nbox, which he offered rather shyly. \"That's some powder for your\ncomplexion. They tell me that ladies find it useful whiles.\"\n\nThe girl's strained face watched him at first in mystification, and then\nbroke slowly into a smile. Youth came back to it, the smile changed to a\nlaugh, a low rippling laugh like far-away bells. She took both his\nhands.\n\n\"You are kind,\" she said, \"you are kind and brave. You are a de-ar.\"\n\nAnd then she kissed him.\n\nNow, as far as Dickson could remember, no one had ever kissed him except\nhis wife. The light touch of her lips on his forehead was like the\npressing of an electric button which explodes some powerful charge and\nalters the face of a countryside. He blushed scarlet; then he wanted to\ncry; then he wanted to sing. An immense exhilaration seized him, and I\nam certain that if at that moment the serried ranks of Bolshevism had\nappeared in the doorway, Dickson would have hurled himself upon them\nwith a joyful shout.\n\nCousin Eug\u00c3\u00a8nie was earnestly eating chocolates, but Saskia had other\nbusiness.\n\n\"You will hold the house?\" she asked.\n\n\"Please God, yes,\" said Heritage. \"I look at it this way. The time is\nvery near when your three gaolers expect the others, their masters. They\nhave not troubled you in the past two days as they threatened, because\nit was not worth while. But they won't want to let you out of their\nsight in the final hours, so they will almost certainly come here to be\non the spot. Our object is to keep them out and confuse their plans.\nSomewhere in this neighbourhood, probably very near, is the man you fear\nmost. If we nonplus the three watchers, they'll have to revise their\npolicy, and that means a delay, and every hour's delay is a gain. Mr.\nMcCunn has found out that the factor Loudon is in the plot, and he has\npurchase enough, it seems, to blanket for a time any appeal to the law.\nBut Mr. McCunn has taken steps to circumvent him, and in twenty-four\nhours we should have help here.\"\n\n\"I do not want the help of your law,\" the girl interrupted. \"It will\nentangle me.\"\n\n\"Not a bit of it,\" said Dickson cheerfully. \"You see, Mem, they've clean\nlost track of the jools, and nobody knows where they are but me. I'm a\ntruthful man, but I'll lie like a packman if I'm asked questions. For\nthe rest, it's a question of kidnapping, I understand, and that's a\nthing that's not to be allowed. My advice is to go to our beds and get a\nlittle sleep while there's a chance of it. The Gorbals Die-Hards are\ngrand watch-dogs.\"\n\nThis view sounded so reasonable that it was at once acted upon. The\nladies' chamber was next door to the smoking-room--what had been the old\nschoolroom. Heritage arranged with Saskia that the lamp was to be kept\nburning low, and that on no account were they to move unless summoned by\nhim. Then he and Dickson made their way to the hall, where there was a\nfaint glimmer from the moon in the upper unshuttered windows--enough to\nreveal the figure of Wee Jaikie on duty at the foot of the staircase.\nThey ascended to the second floor, where, in a large room above the\nhall, Heritage had bestowed his pack. He had managed to open a fold of\nthe shutters, and there was sufficient light to see two big mahogany\nbedsteads without mattresses or bedclothes, and wardrobes and chests of\ndrawers sheeted in holland. Outside the wind was rising again, but the\nrain had stopped. Angry watery clouds scurried across the heavens.\n\nDickson made a pillow of his waterproof, stretched himself on one of the\nbedsteads and, so quiet was his conscience and so weary his body from\nthe buffetings of the past days, was almost instantly asleep. It seemed\nto him that he had scarcely closed his eyes when he was awakened by\nDougal's hand pinching his shoulder. He gathered that the moon was\nsetting, for the room was pitchy dark.\n\n\"The three o' them is approachin' the kitchen door,\" whispered the\nChieftain. \"I seen them from a spy-hole I made out o' a ventilator.\"\n\n\"Is it barricaded?\" asked Heritage, who had apparently not been asleep.\n\n\"Ay, but I've thought o' a far better plan. Why should we keep them out?\nThey'll be safer inside. Listen! We might manage to get them in one at a\ntime. If they can't get in at the kitchen door, they'll send one o' them\nround to get in by another door and open to them. That gives us a chance\nto get them separated, and lock them up. There's walth o' closets and\nhidy-holes all over the place, each with good doors and good keys to\nthem. Supposin' we get the three o' them shut up--the others, when they\ncome, will have nobody to guide them. Of course some time or other the\nthree will break out, but it may be ower late for them. At present we're\nbesieged and they're roamin' the country. Would it no' be far better if\nthey were the ones lockit up and we were goin' loose?\"\n\n\"Supposing they don't come in one at a time?\" Dickson objected.\n\n\"We'll make them,\" said Dougal firmly. \"There's no time to waste. Are ye\nfor it?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Heritage. \"Who's at the kitchen door?\"\n\n\"Peter Paterson. I told him no' to whistle, but to wait on me.... Keep\nyour boots off. Ye're better in your stockin' feet. Wait you in the hall\nand see ye're well hidden, for likely whoever comes in will have a\nlantern. Just you keep quiet unless I give ye a cry. I've planned it a'\nout, and we're ready for them.\"\n\nDougal disappeared, and Dickson and Heritage, with their boots tied\nround their necks by their laces, crept out to the upper landing. The\nhall was impenetrably dark, but full of voices, for the wind was talking\nin the ceiling beams, and murmuring through the long passages. The walls\ncreaked and muttered and little bits of plaster fluttered down. The\nnoise was an advantage for the game of hide-and-seek they proposed to\nplay, but it made it hard to detect the enemy's approach. Dickson, in\norder to get properly wakened, adventured as far as the smoking-room. It\nwas black with night, but below the door of the adjacent room a faint\nline of light showed where the Princess's lamp was burning. He advanced\nto the window, and heard distinctly a foot on the gravel path that led\nto the verandah. This sent him back to the hall in search of Dougal,\nwhom he encountered in the passage. That boy could certainly see in the\ndark, for he caught Dickson's wrist without hesitation.\n\n\"We've got Spittal in the wine-cellar,\" he whispered triumphantly. \"The\nkitchen door was barricaded, and when they tried it, it wouldn't open.\n'Bide here,' says Dobson to Spittal, 'and we'll go round by another door\nand come back and open to ye.' So off they went, and by that time Peter\nPaterson and me had the barricade down. As we expected, Spittal tried\nthe key again and it opens quite easy. He comes in and locks it behind\nhim, and, Dobson having took away the lantern, he gropes his way very\ncarefu' towards the kitchen. There's a point where the wine-cellar door\nand the scullery door are aside each other. He should have taken the\nsecond, but I had it shut so he takes the first. Peter Paterson gave him\na wee shove and he fell down the two-three steps into the cellar, and we\nturned the key on him. Yon cellar has a grand door and no windies.\"\n\n\"And Dobson and L\u00c3\u00a9on are at the verandah door? With a light?\"\n\n\"Thomas Yownie's on duty there. Ye can trust him. Ye'll no fickle Thomas\nYownie.\"\n\nThe next minutes were for Dickson a delirium of excitement not\nunpleasantly shot with flashes of doubt and fear. As a child he had\nplayed hide-and-seek, and his memory had always cherished the delights\nof the game. But how marvellous to play it thus in a great empty house,\nat dark of night, with the heaven filled with tempest, and with death or\nwounds as the stakes!\n\nHe took refuge in a corner where a tapestry curtain and the side of a\nDutch awmry gave him shelter, and from where he stood he could see the\ngarden-room and the beginning of the tiled passage which led to the\nverandah door. That is to say, he could have seen these things if there\nhad been any light, which there was not. He heard the soft flitting of\nbare feet, for a delicate sound is often audible in a din when a loud\nnoise is obscured. Then a gale of wind blew towards him, as from an open\ndoor, and far away gleamed the flickering light of a lantern.\n\nSuddenly the light disappeared and there was a clatter on the floor and\na breaking of glass. Either the wind or Thomas Yownie.\n\nThe verandah door was shut, a match spluttered and the lantern was\nrelit. Dobson and L\u00c3\u00a9on came into the hall, both clad in long\nmackintoshes which glistened from the weather. Dobson halted and\nlistened to the wind howling in the upper spaces. He cursed it bitterly,\nlooked at his watch, and then made an observation which woke the\nliveliest interest in Dickson lurking beside the awmry and Heritage\nensconced in the shadow of a window-seat.\n\n\"He's late. He should have been here five minutes syne. It would be a\ndirty road for his car.\"\n\nSo the Unknown was coming that night. The news made Dickson the more\nresolved to get the watchers under lock and key before reinforcements\narrived, and so put grit in their wheels. Then his party must\nescape--flee anywhere so long as it was far from Dalquharter.\n\n\"You stop here,\" said Dobson, \"I'll go down and let Spidel in. We want\nanother lamp. Get the one that the women use and for God's sake get a\nmove on.\"\n\nThe sound of his feet died in the kitchen passage and then rung again\non the stone stairs. Dickson's ear of faith heard also the soft patter\nof naked feet as the Die-Hards preceded and followed him. He was\ndelivering himself blind and bound into their hands.\n\nFor a minute or two there was no sound but the wind, which had found a\nloose chimney cowl on the roof and screwed out of it an odd sound like\nthe drone of a bagpipe. Dickson, unable to remain any longer in one\nplace, moved into the centre of the hall, believing that L\u00c3\u00a9on had gone\nto the smoking-room. It was a dangerous thing to do, for suddenly a\nmatch was lit a yard from him. He had the sense to drop low, and so was\nout of the main glare of the light. The man with the match apparently\nhad no more, judging by his execrations. Dickson stood stock still,\nlonging for the wind to fall so that he might hear the sound of the\nfellow's boots on the stone floor. He gathered that they were moving\ntowards the smoking-room.\n\n\"Heritage,\" he whispered as loud as he dared, but there was no answer.\n\nThen suddenly a moving body collided with him. He jumped a step back and\nthen stood at attention, \"Is that you, Dobson?\" a voice asked.\n\nNow behold the occasional advantage of a nickname. Dickson thought he\nwas being addressed as \"Dogson\" after the Poet's fashion. Had he dreamed\nit was L\u00c3\u00a9on he would not have replied, but fluttered off into the\nshadows and so missed a piece of vital news.\n\n\"Ay, it's me,\" he whispered.\n\nHis voice and accent were Scotch, like Dobson's, and L\u00c3\u00a9on suspected\nnothing.\n\n\"I do not like this wind,\" he grumbled. \"The Captain's letter said at\ndawn, but there is no chance of the Danish brig making your little\nharbour in this weather. She must lie off and land the men by boats.\nThat I do not like. It is too public.\"\n\nThe news--tremendous news, for it told that the new-comers would come by\nsea, which had never before entered Dickson's head--so interested him\nthat he stood dumb and ruminating. The silence made the Belgian suspect;\nhe put out a hand and felt a waterproofed arm which might have been\nDobson's. But the height of the shoulder proved that it was not the\nburly innkeeper. There was an oath, a quick movement, and Dickson went\ndown with a knee on his chest and two hands at his throat.\n\n\"Heritage,\" he gasped. \"Help!\"\n\nThere was a sound of furniture scraped violently on the floor. A gurgle\nfrom Dickson served as a guide, and the Poet suddenly cascaded over the\ncombatants. He felt for a head, found L\u00c3\u00a9on's, and gripped the neck so\nsavagely that the owner loosened his hold on Dickson. The last-named\nfound himself being buffeted violently by heavy-shod feet which seemed\nto be manoeuvring before an unseen enemy. He rolled out of the road and\nencountered another pair of feet, this time unshod. Then came a sound of\na concussion, as if metal or wood had struck some part of a human frame,\nand then a stumble and fall.\n\nAfter that a good many things all seemed to happen at once. There was a\nsudden light, which showed L\u00c3\u00a9on blinking with a short loaded\nlife-preserver in his hand, and Heritage prone in front of him on the\nfloor. It also showed Dickson the figure of Dougal, and more than one\nDie-Hard in the background. The light went out as suddenly as it had\nappeared. There was a whistle, and a hoarse \"Come on, men,\" and then for\ntwo seconds there was a desperate silent combat. It ended with L\u00c3\u00a9on's\nhead meeting the floor so violently that its possessor became oblivious\nof further proceedings. He was dragged into a cubby-hole, which had once\nbeen used for coats and rugs, and the door locked on him. Then the light\nsprang forth again. It revealed Dougal and five Die-Hards, somewhat the\nworse for wear; it revealed also Dickson squatted with outspread\nwaterproof very like a sitting hen.\n\n\"Where's Dobson?\" he asked.\n\n\"In the boiler-house,\" and for once Dougal's gravity had laughter in it.\n\"Govey Dick! but yon was a fecht! Me and Peter Paterson and Wee Jaikie\nstarted it, but it was the whole company afore the end. Are ye better,\nJaikie?\"\n\n\"Ay, I'm better,\" said a pallid midget.\n\n\"He kickit Jaikie in the stomach and Jaikie was seeck,\" Dougal\nexplained. \"That's the three accounted for. Now they're safe for five\nhours at the least. I think mysel' that Dobson will be the first to get\nout, but he'll have his work letting out the others. Now, I'm for\nflittin' to the old Tower. They'll no ken where we are for a long time,\nand anyway yon place will be far easier to defend. Without they kindle\na fire and smoke us out, I don't see how they'll beat us. Our provisions\nare a' there, and there's a grand well o' water inside. Forbye there's\nthe road down the rocks that'll keep our communications open.... But\nwhat's come to Mr. Heritage?\"\n\nDickson to his shame had forgotten all about his friend. The Poet lay\nvery quiet with his head on one side and his legs crooked limply. Blood\ntrickled over his eyes from an ugly scar on his forehead. Dickson felt\nhis heart and pulse and found them faint but regular. The man had got a\nswinging blow and might have a slight concussion; for the present he was\nunconscious.\n\n\"All the more reason why we should flit,\" said Dougal. \"What d'ye say,\nMr. McCunn?\"\n\n\"Flit, of course, but further than the old Tower. What's the time?\" He\nlifted Heritage's wrist and saw from his watch that it was half-past\nthree. \"Mercy! It's nearly morning. Afore we put these blagyirds away,\nthey were conversing, at least L\u00c3\u00a9on and Dobson were. They said that they\nexpected somebody every moment, but that the car would be late. We've\nstill got that Somebody to tackle. Then L\u00c3\u00a9on spoke to me in the dark,\nthinking I was Dobson, and cursed the wind, saying it would keep the\nDanish brig from getting in at dawn as had been intended. D'you see what\nthat means? The worst of the lot, the ones the ladies are in terror of,\nare coming by sea. Ay, and they can return by sea. We thought that the\nattack would be by land, and that even if they succeeded we could hang\non to their heels and follow them, till we got them stopped. But that's\nimpossible! If they come in from the water, they can go out by the\nwater, and there'll never be more heard tell of the ladies or of you or\nme.\"\n\nDougal's face was once again sunk in gloom. \"What's your plan, then?\"\n\n\"We must get the ladies away from here--away inland, far from the sea.\nThe rest of us must stand a siege in the old Tower, so that the enemy\nwill think we're all there. Please God we'll hold out long enough for\nhelp to arrive. But we mustn't hang about here. There's the man Dobson\nmentioned--he may come any second, and we want to be away first. Get the\nladder, Dougal.... Four of you take Mr. Heritage, and two come with me\nand carry the ladies' things. It's no' raining, but the wind's enough to\ntake the wings off a seagull.\"\n\nDickson roused Saskia and her cousin, bidding them be ready in ten\nminutes. Then with the help of the Die-Hards he proceeded to transport\nthe necessary supplies--the stove, oil, dishes, clothes and wraps; more\nthan one journey was needed of small boys, hidden under clouds of\nbaggage. When everything had gone he collected the keys, behind which,\nin various quarters of the house, three gaolers fumed impotently, and\ngave them to Wee Jaikie to dispose of in some secret nook. Then he led\nthe two ladies to the verandah, the elder cross and sleepy, the younger\nalert at the prospect of movement.\n\n\"Tell me again,\" she said. \"You have locked all the three up, and they\nare now the imprisoned?\"\n\n\"Well, it was the boys that, properly speaking, did the locking up.\"\n\n\"It is a great--how do you say?--a turning of the tables. Ah--what is\nthat?\"\n\nAt the end of the verandah there was a clattering down of pots which\ncould not be due to the wind, since the place was sheltered. There was\nstill only the faintest hint of light, and black night still lurked in\nthe crannies. Followed another fall of pots, as from a clumsy intruder,\nand then a man appeared, clear against the glass door by which the path\ndescended to the rock garden.\n\nIt was the fourth man, whom the three prisoners had awaited. Dickson had\nno doubt at all about his identity. He was that villain from whom all\nthe others took their orders, the man whom the Princess shuddered at.\nBefore starting he had loaded his pistol. Now he tugged it from his\nwaterproof pocket, pointed it at the other and fired.\n\nThe man seemed to be hit, for he spun round and clapped a hand to his\nleft arm. Then he fled through the door, which he left open.\n\nDickson was after him like a hound. At the door he saw him running and\nraised his pistol for another shot. Then he dropped it, for he saw\nsomething in the crouching, dodging figure which was familiar.\n\n\"A mistake,\" he explained to Jaikie when he returned. \"But the shot\nwasn't wasted. I've just had a good try at killing the factor!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nDEALS WITH AN ESCAPE AND A JOURNEY\n\n\nFive scouts' lanterns burned smokily in the ground room of the keep when\nDickson ushered his charges through its cavernous door. The lights\nflickered in the gusts that swept after them and whistled through the\nslits of window, so that the place was full of monstrous shadows, and\nits accustomed odour of mould and disuse was changed to a salty\nfreshness. Upstairs on the first floor Thomas Yownie had deposited the\nladies' baggage, and was busy making beds out of derelict iron bedsteads\nand the wraps brought from their room. On the ground floor on a heap of\nlitter covered by an old scout's blanket lay Heritage, with Dougal in\nattendance.\n\nThe Chieftain had washed the blood from the Poet's brow and the touch of\ncold water was bringing back his senses. Saskia with a cry flew to him,\nand waved off Dickson who had fetched one of the bottles of liqueur\nbrandy. She slipped a hand inside his shirt and felt the beating of his\nheart. Then her slim fingers ran over his forehead.\n\n\"A bad blow,\" she muttered, \"but I do not think he is ill. There is no\nfracture. When I nursed in the Alexander Hospital I learnt much about\nhead wounds. Do not give him cognac if you value his life.\"\n\nHeritage was talking now and with strange tongues. Phrases like \"lined\ndigesters\" and \"free sulphurous acid\" came from his lips. He implored\nsome one to tell him if \"the first cook\" was finished, and he upbraided\nsome one else for \"cooling off\" too fast.\n\nThe girl raised her head. \"But I fear he has become mad,\" she said.\n\n\"Wheesht, Mem,\" said Dickson, who recognised the jargon. \"He's a paper\nmaker.\"\n\nSaskia sat down on the litter and lifted his head so that it rested on\nher breast. Dougal at her bidding brought a certain case from her\nbaggage, and with swift, capable hands she made a bandage and rubbed the\nwound with ointment before tying it up. Then her fingers seemed to play\nabout his temples and along his cheeks and neck. She was the\nprofessional nurse now, absorbed, sexless. Heritage ceased to babble,\nhis eyes shut and he was asleep.\n\nShe remained where she was, so that the Poet, when a few minutes later\nhe woke, found himself lying with his head in her lap. She spoke first,\nin an imperative tone: \"You are well now. Your head does not ache. You\nare strong again.\"\n\n\"No. Yes,\" he murmured. Then more clearly: \"Where am I? Oh, I remember,\nI caught a lick on the head. What's become of the brutes?\"\n\nDickson, who had extracted food from the Mearns Street box and was\npressing it on the others, replied through a mouthful of biscuit: \"We're\nin the old Tower. The three are lockit up in the House. Are you feeling\nbetter, Mr. Heritage?\"\n\nThe Poet suddenly realised Saskia's position and the blood came to his\npale face. He got to his feet with an effort and held out a hand to the\ngirl. \"I'm all right now, I think. Only a little dicky on my legs. A\nthousand thanks, Princess. I've given you a lot of trouble.\"\n\nShe smiled at him tenderly. \"You say that when you have risked your life\nfor me.\"\n\n\"There's no time to waste,\" the relentless Dougal broke in. \"Comin' over\nhere, I heard a shot. What was it?\"\n\n\"It was me,\" said Dickson. \"I was shootin' at the factor.\"\n\n\"Did ye hit him?\"\n\n\"I think so, but I'm sorry to say not badly. When I last saw him he was\nrunning too quick for a sore hurt man. When I fired I thought it was the\nother man--the one they were expecting.\"\n\nDickson marvelled at himself, yet his speech was not bravado but the\nhonest expression of his mind. He was keyed up to a mood in which he\nfeared nothing very much, certainly not the laws of his country. If he\nfell in with the Unknown, he was entirely resolved, if his Maker\npermitted him, to do murder as being the simplest and justest solution.\nAnd if in the pursuit of this laudable intention he happened to wing\nlesser game it was no fault of his.\n\n\"Well, it's a pity ye didn't get him,\" said Dougal, \"him being what we\nken him to be.... I'm for holding a council o' war, and considerin' the\nwhole position. So far we haven't done that badly. We've shifted our\nbase without serious casualties. We've got a far better position to\nhold, for there's too many ways into yon Hoose, and here there's just\none. Besides, we've fickled the enemy. They'll take some time to find\nout where we've gone. But, mind you, we can't count on their staying\nlong shut up. Dobson's no' safe in the boiler-house, for there's a\nskylight far up and he'll see it when the light comes and maybe before.\nSo we'd better get our plans ready. A word with ye, Mr. McCunn,\" and he\nled Dickson aside.\n\n\"D'ye ken what these blagyirds were up to,\" he whispered fiercely in\nDickson's ear. \"They were goin' to pushion the lassie. How do I ken,\nsays you? Because Thomas Yownie heard Dobson say to Lean at the scullery\ndoor, 'Have ye got the dope?' he says, and Lean says, 'Ay.' Thomas\nmindit the word for he had heard about it at the Picters.\"\n\nDickson exclaimed in horror.\n\n\"What d'ye make o' that? I'll tell ye. They wanted to make sure of her,\nbut they wouldn't have thought o' dope unless the men they expectit were\ndue to arrive any moment. As I see it, we've to face a siege not by the\nthree but by a dozen or more, and it'll no' be long till it starts. Now,\nisn't it a mercy we're safe in here?\"\n\nDickson returned to the others with a grave face.\n\n\"Where d'you think the new folk are coming from?\" he asked.\n\nHeritage answered, \"From Auchenlochan, I suppose? Or perhaps down from\nthe hills?\"\n\n\"You're wrong.\" And he told of L\u00c3\u00a9on's mistaken confidences to him in\nthe darkness. \"They are coming from the sea, just like the old pirates.\"\n\n\"The sea,\" Heritage repeated in a dazed voice.\n\n\"Ay, the sea. Think what that means. If they had been coming by the\nroads, we could have kept track of them, even if they beat us, and some\nof these laddies could have stuck to them and followed them up till help\ncame. It can't be such an easy job to carry a young lady against her\nwill along Scotch roads. But the sea's a different matter. If they've\ngot a fast boat they could be out of the Firth and away beyond the law\nbefore we could wake up a single policeman. Ay, and even if the\nGovernment took it up and warned all the ports and ships at sea, what's\nto hinder them to find a hidy-hole about Ireland--or Norway? I tell you,\nit's a far more desperate business than I thought, and it'll no' do to\nwait on and trust that the Chief Constable will turn up afore the\nmischief's done.\"\n\n\"The moral,\" said Heritage, \"is that there can be no surrender. We've\ngot to stick it out in this old place at all costs.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Dickson emphatically. \"The moral is that we must shift the\nladies. We've got the chance while Dobson and his friends are locked up.\nLet's get them as far away as we can from the sea. They're far safer\ntramping the moors, and it's no' likely the new folk will dare to follow\nus.\"\n\n\"But I cannot go.\" Saskia, who had been listening intently, shook her\nhead. \"I promised to wait here till my friend came. If I leave I shall\nnever find him.\"\n\n\"If you stay you certainly never will, for you'll be away with the\nruffians. Take a sensible view, Mem. You'll be no good to your friend or\nyour friend to you if before night you're rocking in a ship.\"\n\nThe girl shook her head again, gently but decisively. \"It was our\narrangement. I cannot break it. Besides, I am sure that he will come in\ntime, for he has never failed----\"\n\nThere was a desperate finality about the quiet tones and the weary face\nwith the shadow of a smile on it.\n\nThen Heritage spoke. \"I don't think your plan will quite do, Dogson.\nSupposing we all break for the hinterland and the Danish brig finds the\nbirds flown, that won't end the trouble. They will get on the Princess's\ntrail, and the whole persecution will start again. I want to see things\nbrought to a head here and now. If we can stick it out here long enough,\nwe may trap the whole push and rid the world of a pretty gang of\nmiscreants. Once let them show their hand, and then, if the police are\nhere by that time, we can jug the lot for piracy or something worse.\"\n\n\"That's all right,\" said Dougal, \"but we'd put up a better fight if we\nhad the women off our mind. I've aye read that when a castle was going\nto be besieged the first thing was to rid get of the civilians.\"\n\n\"Sensible to the last, Dougal,\" said Dickson approvingly. \"That's just\nwhat I'm saying. I'm strong for a fight, but put the ladies in a safe\nbit first, for they're our weak point.\"\n\n\"Do you think that if you were fighting my enemies, I would consent to\nbe absent?\" came Saskia's reproachful question.\n\n\"'Deed no, Mem,\" said Dickson heartily. His martial spirit was with\nHeritage, but his prudence did not sleep, and he suddenly saw a way of\nplacating both. \"Just you listen to what I propose. What do we amount\nto? Mr. Heritage, six laddies, and myself--and I'm no more used to\nfighting than an old wife. We've seven desperate villains against us,\nand afore night they may be seventy. We've a fine old castle here, but\nfor defence we want more than stone walls--we want a garrison. I tell\nyou we must get help somewhere. Ay, but how, says you? Well, coming here\nI noticed a gentleman's house away up ayont the railway and close to the\nhills. The laird's maybe not at home, but there will be men there of\nsome kind--gamekeepers and woodmen and such like. My plan is to go there\nat once and ask for help. Now, it's useless me going alone, for nobody\nwould listen to me. They'd tell me to go back to the shop or they'd\nthink me demented. But with you, Mem, it would be a different matter.\nThey wouldn't disbelieve you. So I want you to come with me and to come\nat once, for God knows how soon our need will be sore. We'll leave your\ncousin with Mrs. Morran in the village, for bed's the place for her, and\nthen you and me will be off on our business.\"\n\nThe girl looked at Heritage, who nodded. \"It's the only way,\" he said.\n\"Get every man jack you can raise, and if it's humanly possible get a\ngun or two. I believe there's time enough, for I don't see the brig\narriving in broad daylight.\"\n\n\"D'you not?\" Dickson asked rudely. \"Have you considered what day this\nis? It's the Sabbath, the best of days for an ill deed. There's no kirk\nhereaways, and everybody in the parish will be sitting indoors by the\nfire.\" He looked at his watch. \"In half an hour it'll be light. Haste\nyou, Mem, and get ready. Dougal, what's the weather?\"\n\nThe Chieftain swung open the door, and sniffed the air. The wind had\nfallen for the time being, and the surge of the tides below the rocks\nrose like the clamour of a mob. With the lull, mist and a thin drizzle\nhad cloaked the world again.\n\nTo Dickson's surprise Dougal seemed to be in good spirits. He began to\nsing to a hymn tune a strange ditty.\n\n    \"Class-conscious we are, and class-conscious wull be\n     Till our fit's on the neck o' the Boorjoyzee.\"\n\n\"What on earth are you singing?\" Dickson inquired.\n\nDougal grinned. \"Wee Jaikie went to a Socialist Sunday school last\nwinter because he heard they were for fechtin' battles. Ay, and they\ntelled him he was to jine a thing called an International, and Jaikie\nthought it was a fitba' club. But when he fund out there was no magic\nlantern or swaree at Christmas he gie'd it the chuck. They learned him\na heap o' queer songs. That's one.\"\n\n\"What does the last word mean?\"\n\n\"I don't ken. Jaikie thought it was some kind of a draigon.\"\n\n\"It's a daft-like thing anyway.... When's high water?\"\n\nDougal answered that to the best of his knowledge it fell between four\nand five in the afternoon.\n\n\"Then that's when we may expect the foreign gentry if they think to\nbring their boat in to the Garple foot.... Dougal, lad, I trust you to\nkeep a most careful and prayerful watch. You had better get the\nDie-Hards out of the Tower and all round the place afore Dobson and Co.\nget loose, or you'll no' get a chance later. Don't lose your mobility,\nas the sodgers say. Mr. Heritage can hold the fort, but you laddies\nshould be spread out like a screen.\"\n\n\"That was my notion,\" said Dougal. \"I'll detail two Die-Hards--Thomas\nYownie and Wee Jaikie--to keep in touch with ye and watch for ye comin'\nback. Thomas ye ken already; ye'll no fickle Thomas Yownie. But don't be\nmistook about Wee Jaikie. He's terrible fond of greetin', but it's no\nfright with him but excitement. It's just a habit he's gotten. When ye\nsee Jaikie begin to greet, ye may be sure that Jaikie's gettin'\ndangerous.\"\n\nThe door shut behind them and Dickson found himself with his two charges\nin a world dim with fog and rain and the still lingering darkness. The\nair was raw, and had the sour smell which comes from soaked earth and\nwet boughs when the leaves are not yet fledged. Both the women were\nmiserably equipped for such an expedition. Cousin Eug\u00c3\u00a8nie trailed heavy\nfurs, Saskia's only wrap was a bright-coloured shawl about her\nshoulders, and both wore thin foreign shoes. Dickson insisted on\nstripping off his trusty waterproof and forcing it on the Princess, on\nwhose slim body it hung very loose and very short. The elder woman\nstumbled and whimpered and needed the constant support of his arm,\nwalking like a townswoman from the knees. But Saskia swung from the hips\nlike a free woman, and Dickson had much ado to keep up with her. She\nseemed to delight in the bitter freshness of the dawn, inhaling deep\nbreaths of it, and humming fragments of a tune.\n\nGuided by Thomas Yownie they took the road which Dickson and Heritage\nhad travelled the first evening, through the shrubberies on the north\nside of the House and the side avenue beyond which the ground fell to\nthe Laver glen. On their right the House rose like a dark cloud, but\nDickson had lost his terror of it. There were three angry men inside it,\nhe remembered: long let them stay there. He marvelled at his mood, and\nalso rejoiced, for his worst fear had always been that he might prove a\ncoward. Now he was puzzled to think how he could ever be frightened\nagain, for his one object was to succeed, and in that absorption fear\nseemed to him merely a waste of time. \"It all comes of treating the\nthing as a business proposition,\" he told himself.\n\nBut there was far more in his heart than this sober resolution. He was\nintoxicated with the resurgence of youth and felt a rapture of audacity\nwhich he never remembered in his decorous boyhood. \"I haven't been doing\nbadly for an old man,\" he reflected with glee. What, oh, what had become\nof the pillar of commerce, the man who might have been a Bailie had he\nsought municipal honours, the elder in the Guthrie Memorial Kirk, the\ninstructor of literary young men? In the past three days he had levanted\nwith jewels which had once been an Emperor's and certainly were not his;\nhe had burglariously entered and made free of a strange house; he had\nplayed hide-and-seek at the risk of his neck and had wrestled in the\ndark with a foreign miscreant; he had shot at an eminent solicitor with\nintent to kill; and he was now engaged in tramping the world with a\nfairy-tale Princess. I blush to confess that of each of his doings he\nwas unashamedly proud, and thirsted for many more in the same line.\n\"Gosh, but I'm seeing life,\" was his unregenerate conclusion.\n\nWithout sight or sound of a human being, they descended to the Laver,\nclimbed again by the cart track, and passed the deserted West Lodge and\ninn to the village. It was almost full dawn when the three stood in Mrs.\nMorran's kitchen.\n\n\"I've brought you two ladies, Auntie Phemie,\" said Dickson.\n\nThey made an odd group in that cheerful place, where the new-lit fire\nwas crackling in the big grate--the wet undignified form of Dickson,\nunshaven of cheek and chin and disreputable in garb: the shrouded\nfigure of Cousin Eug\u00c3\u00a8nie, who had sunk into the arm-chair and closed her\neyes; the slim girl, into whose face the weather had whipped a glow like\nblossom; and the hostess, with her petticoats kilted and an ancient\nmutch on her head.\n\nMrs. Morran looked once at Saskia, and then did a thing which she had\nnot done since her girlhood. She curtseyed.\n\n\"I'm proud to see ye here, Mem. Off wi' your things, and I'll get ye dry\nclaes. Losh, ye're fair soppin'. And your shoon! Ye maun change your\nfeet.... Dickson! Awa' up to the loft, and dinna you stir till I give ye\na cry. The leddies will change by the fire. And you, Mem\"--this to\nCousin Eug\u00c3\u00a8nie--\"the place for you's your bed. I'll kinnle a fire ben\nthe hoose in a jiffy. And syne ye'll have breakfast--ye'll hae a cup o'\ntea wi' me now, for the kettle's just on the boil. Awa' wi' ye,\nDickson,\" and she stamped her foot.\n\nDickson departed, and in the loft washed his face, and smoked a pipe on\nthe edge of the bed, watching the mist eddying up the village street.\nFrom below rose the sounds of hospitable bustle, and when after some\ntwenty minutes' vigil he descended, he found Saskia toasting stockinged\ntoes by the fire in the great arm-chair, and Mrs. Morran setting the\ntable.\n\n\"Auntie Phemie, hearken to me. We've taken on too big a job for two men\nand six laddies, and help we've got to get, and that this very morning.\nD'you mind the big white house away up near the hills ayont the station\nand east of the Ayr road? It looked like a gentleman's shooting lodge. I\nwas thinking of trying there. Mercy!\"\n\nThe exclamation was wrung from him by his eyes settling on Saskia and\nnoting her apparel. Gone were her thin foreign clothes, and in their\nplace she wore a heavy tweed skirt cut very short, and thick homespun\nstockings, which had been made for some one with larger feet than hers.\nA pair of the coarse low-heeled shoes, which country folk wear in the\nfarmyard, stood warming by the hearth. She still had her russet jumper,\nbut round her neck hung a grey wool scarf, of the kind known as a\n\"comforter.\" Amazingly pretty she looked in Dickson's eyes, but with a\ndifferent kind of prettiness. The sense of fragility had fled, and he\nsaw how nobly built she was for all her exquisiteness. She looked like a\nqueen, he thought, but a queen to go gipsying through the world with.\n\n\"Ay, they're some o' Elspeth's things, rale guid furthy claes,\" said\nMrs. Morran complacently. \"And the shoon are what she used to gang about\nthe byres wi' when she was in the Castlewham dairy. The leddy was\ntellin' me she was for trampin' the hills, and thae things will keep her\ndry and warm.... I ken the hoose ye mean. They ca' it the Mains of\nGarple. And I ken the man that bides in it. He's yin Sir Erchibald\nRoylance. English, but his mither was a Dalziel. I'm no weel acquaint\nwi' his forbears, but I'm weel eneuch acquaint wi' Sir Erchie, and\n'better a guid coo than a coo o' a guid kind,' as my mither used to say.\nHe used to be an awfu' wild callant, a freend o' puir Maister Quentin,\nand up to ony deevilry. But they tell me he's a quieter lad since the\nwar, and sair lamed by fa'in oot o' an airyplane.\"\n\n\"Will he be at the Mains just now?\" Dickson asked.\n\n\"I wadna wonder. He has a muckle place in England, but he aye used to\ncome here in the back-end for the shootin' and in Aprile for birds. He's\nclean daft about birds. He'll be out a' day at the Craig watchin'\nsolans, or lyin' a' mornin' i' the moss lookin' at bog-blitters.\"\n\n\"Will he help, think you?\"\n\n\"I'll wager he'll help. Onyway it's your best chance, and better a wee\nbush than nae beild. Now, sit in to your breakfast.\"\n\nIt was a merry meal. Mrs. Morran dispensed tea and gnomic wisdom. Saskia\nate heartily, speaking little, but once or twice laying her hand softly\non her hostess's gnarled fingers. Dickson was in such spirits that he\ngobbled shamelessly, being both hungry and hurried, and he spoke of the\nstill unconquered enemy with ease and disrespect, so that Mrs. Morran\nwas moved to observe that there was \"naething sae bauld as a blind\nmear.\" But when in a sudden return of modesty he belittled his\nusefulness and talked sombrely of his mature years he was told that he\n\"wad never be auld wi' sae muckle honesty.\" Indeed it was very clear\nthat Mrs. Morran approved of her nephew.\n\nThey did not linger over breakfast, for both were impatient to be on the\nroad. Mrs. Morran assisted Saskia to put on Elspeth's shoes. \"'Even a\nyoung fit finds comfort in an auld bauchle,' as my mother, honest woman,\nused to say.\" Dickson's waterproof was restored to him, and for Saskia\nan old raincoat belonging to the son in South Africa was discovered,\nwhich fitted her better. \"Siccan weather,\" said the hostess, as she\nopened the door to let in a swirl of wind. \"The deil's aye kind to his\nain. Haste ye back, Mem, and be sure I'll tak' guid care o' your leddy\ncousin.\"\n\nThe proper way to the Mains of Garple was either by the station and the\nAyr road, or by the Auchenlochan highway, branching off half a mile\nbeyond the Garple bridge. But Dickson, who had been studying the map and\nfancied himself as a pathfinder, chose the direct route across the Long\nMuir as being at once shorter and more sequestered. With the dawn the\nwind had risen again, but it had shifted towards the north-west and was\nmany degrees colder. The mist was furling on the hills like sails, the\nrain had ceased, and out at sea the eye covered a mile or two of wild\nwater. The moor was drenching wet, and the peat bogs were brimming with\ninky pools, so that soon the travellers were soaked to the knees.\nDickson had no fear of pursuit, for he calculated that Dobson and his\nfriends, even if they had got out, would be busy looking for the truants\nin the vicinity of the House and would presently be engaged with the old\nTower. But he realised, too, that speed on his errand was vital, for at\nany moment the Unknown might arrive from the sea.\n\nSo he kept up a good pace, half-running, half-striding, till they had\npassed the railway, and he found himself gasping with a stitch in his\nside, and compelled to rest in the lee of what had once been a\nsheepfold. Saskia amazed him. She moved over the rough heather like a\ndeer, and it was her hand that helped him across the deeper hags. Before\nsuch youth and vigour he felt clumsy and old. She stood looking down at\nhim as he recovered his breath, cool, unruffled, alert as Diana. His\nmind fled to Heritage, and it occurred to him suddenly that the Poet had\nset his affections very high. Loyalty drove him to speak a word for his\nfriend.\n\n\"I've got the easy job,\" he said. \"Mr. Heritage will have the whole pack\non him in that old Tower, and him with such a sore clout on his head.\nI've left him my pistol. He's a terrible brave man!\"\n\nShe smiled.\n\n\"Ay, and he's a poet too.\"\n\n\"So?\" she said. \"I did not know. He is very young.\"\n\n\"He's a man of very high ideels.\"\n\nShe puzzled at the word, and then smiled. \"I know him. He is like many\nof our young men in Russia, the students--his mind is in a ferment and\nhe does not know what he wants. But he is brave.\"\n\nThis seemed to Dickson's loyal soul but a chilly tribute.\n\n\"I think he is in love with me,\" she continued.\n\nHe looked up startled and saw in her face that which gave him a view\ninto a strange new world. He had thought that women blushed when they\ntalked of love, but her eyes were as grave and candid as a boy's. Here\nwas one who had gone through waters so deep that she had lost the\nfoibles of sex. Love to her was only a word of ill omen, a threat on the\nlips of brutes, an extra battalion of peril in an army of perplexities.\nHe felt like some homely rustic who finds himself swept unwittingly into\nthe moonlight hunt of Artemis and her maidens.\n\n\"He is a romantic,\" she said. \"I have known so many like him.\"\n\n\"He's no' that,\" said Dickson shortly. \"Why, he used to be aye laughing\nat me for being romantic. He's one that's looking for truth and reality,\nhe says, and he's terrible down on the kind of poetry I like myself.\"\n\nShe smiled. \"They all talk so. But you, my friend Dickson\" (she\npronounced the name in two staccato syllables ever so prettily), \"you\nare different. Tell me about yourself.\"\n\n\"I'm just what you see--a middle-aged retired grocer.\"\n\n\"Grocer?\" she queried. \"Ah, yes, _\u00c3\u00a9picier_. But you are a very\nremarkable _\u00c3\u00a9picier_. Mr. Heritage I understand, but you and those\nlittle boys--no. I am sure of one thing--you are not a romantic. You are\ntoo humorous and--and----I think you are like Ulysses, for it would not\nbe easy to defeat you.\"\n\nHer eyes were kind, nay affectionate, and Dickson experienced a\npreposterous rapture in his soul, followed by a sinking, as he realised\nhow far the job was still from being completed.\n\n\"We must be getting on, Mem,\" he said hastily, and the two plunged again\ninto the heather.\n\nThe Ayr road was crossed, and the fir wood around the Mains became\nvisible, and presently the white gates of the entrance. A wind-blown\nspire of smoke beyond the trees proclaimed that the house was not\nuntenanted. As they entered the drive the Scots firs were tossing in the\ngale, which blew fiercely at this altitude, but, the dwelling itself\nbeing more in the hollow, the daffodil clumps on the lawn were but\nmildly fluttered.\n\nThe door was opened by a one-armed butler who bore all the marks of the\nold regular soldier. Dickson produced a card and asked to see his master\non urgent business. Sir Archibald was at home, he was told, and had just\nfinished breakfast. The two were led into a large bare chamber which had\nall the chill and mustiness of a bachelor's drawing-room. The butler\nreturned, and said Sir Archibald would see him. \"I'd better go myself\nfirst and prepare the way, Mem,\" Dickson whispered and followed the man\nacross the hall.\n\nHe found himself ushered into a fair-sized room where a bright fire was\nburning. On a table lay the remains of breakfast, and the odour of food\nmingled pleasantly with the scent of peat. The horns and heads of big\ngame, foxes' masks, the model of a gigantic salmon and several bookcases\nadorned the wall, and books and maps were mixed with decanters and\ncigar-boxes on the long sideboard. After the wild out of doors the\nplace seemed the very shrine of comfort. A young man sat in an armchair\nby the fire with a leg on a stool; he was smoking a pipe, and reading\nthe _Field_, and on another stool at his elbow was a pile of new novels.\nHe was a pleasant brown-faced young man, with remarkably smooth hair and\na roving humorous eye.\n\n\"Come in, Mr. McCunn. Very glad to see you. If, as I take it, you're the\ngrocer, you're a household name in these parts. I get all my supplies\nfrom you, and I've just been makin' inroads on one of your divine hams.\nNow, what can I do for you?\"\n\n\"I'm very proud to hear what you say, Sir Archibald. But I've not come\non business. I've come with the queerest story you ever heard in your\nlife, and I've come to ask your help.\"\n\n\"Go ahead. A good story is just what I want this vile mornin'.\"\n\n\"I'm not here alone. I've a lady with me.\"\n\n\"God bless my soul! A lady!\"\n\n\"Ay, a princess. She's in the next room.\"\n\nThe young man looked wildly at him and waved the book he had been\nreading.\n\n\"Excuse me, Mr. McCunn, but are you quite sober? I beg your pardon. I\nsee you are. But you know, it isn't done. Princesses don't as a rule\ncome here after breakfast to pass the time of day. It's more absurd than\nthis shocker I've been readin'.\"\n\n\"All the same it's a fact. She'll tell you the story herself, and you'll\nbelieve her quick enough. But to prepare your mind I'll just give you a\nsketch of the events of the last few days.\"\n\nBefore the sketch was concluded the young man had violently rung the\nbell. \"Sime,\" he shouted to the servant, \"clear away this mess and lay\nthe table again. Order more breakfast, all the breakfast you can get.\nOpen the windows and get the tobacco smoke out of the air. Tidy up the\nplace for there's a lady comin'. Quick, you juggins!\"\n\nHe was on his feet now, and, with his arm in Dickson's, was heading for\nthe door.\n\n\"My sainted aunt! And you topped off with pottin' at the factor. I've\nseen a few things in my day, but I'm blessed if I ever met a bird like\nyou!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nGRAVITY OUT OF BED\n\n\nIt is probable that Sir Archibald Roylance did not altogether believe\nDickson's tale; it may be that he considered him an agreeable romancer,\nor a little mad, or no more than a relief to the tedium of a wet Sunday\nmorning. But his incredulity did not survive one glance at Saskia as she\nstood in that bleak drawing-room among Victorian water-colours and faded\nchintzes. The young man's boyishness deserted him. He stopped short in\nhis tracks, and made a profound and awkward bow. \"I am at your service,\nMademoiselle,\" he said, amazed at himself. The words seemed to have come\nout of a confused memory of plays and novels.\n\nShe inclined her head--a little on one side, and looked towards Dickson.\n\n\"Sir Archibald's going to do his best for us,\" said that squire of\ndames. \"I was telling him that we had had our breakfast.\"\n\n\"Let's get out of this sepulchre,\" said their host, who was recovering\nhimself. \"There's a roasting fire in my den. Of course you'll have\nsomething to eat--hot coffee, anyhow--I've trained my cook to make\ncoffee like a Frenchwoman. The housekeeper will take charge of you, if\nyou want to tidy up, and you must excuse our ramshackle ways, please. I\ndon't believe there's ever been a lady in this house before, you know.\"\n\nHe led her to the smoking-room and ensconced her in the great chair by\nthe fire. Smilingly she refused a series of offers which ranged from a\nsheepskin mantle which he had got in the Pamirs and which he thought\nmight fit her, to hot whisky and water as a specific against a chill.\nBut she accepted a pair of slippers and deftly kicked off the brogues\nprovided by Mrs. Morran. Also, while Dickson started rapaciously on a\nsecond breakfast, she allowed him to pour her out a cup of coffee.\n\n\"You are a soldier?\" she asked.\n\n\"Two years infantry--5th Battalion Lennox Highlanders, and then Flying\nCorps. Top-hole time I had too, till the day before the Armistice when\nmy luck gave out and I took a nasty toss. Consequently I'm not as fast\non my legs now as I'd like to be.\"\n\n\"You were a friend of Captain Kennedy?\"\n\n\"His oldest. We were at the same private school, and he was at m'\ntutor's, and we were never much separated till he went abroad to cram\nfor the Diplomatic and I started east to shoot things.\"\n\n\"Then I will tell you what I told Captain Kennedy.\" Saskia, looking into\nthe heart of the peats, began the story of which we have already heard a\nversion, but she told it differently, for she was telling it to one who\nmore or less belonged to her own world. She mentioned names at which the\nother nodded. She spoke of a certain Paul Abreskov. \"I heard of him at\nBokhara in 1912,\" said Sir Archie, and his face grew solemn. Sometimes\nshe lapsed into French, and her hearer's brow wrinkled, but he appeared\nto follow. When she had finished he drew a long breath.\n\n\"My Aunt! What a time you've been through! I've seen pluck in my day,\nbut yours! It's not thinkable. D'you mind if I ask a question, Princess?\nBolshevism we know all about, and I admit Trotsky and his friends are a\npretty effective push; but how on earth have they got a world-wide graft\ngoing in the time so that they can stretch their net to an\nout-of-the-way spot like this? It looks as if they had struck a Napoleon\nsomewhere.\"\n\n\"You do not understand,\" she said. \"I cannot make any one\nunderstand--except a Russian. My country has been broken to pieces, and\nthere is no law in it; therefore it is a nursery of crime. So would\nEngland be, or France, if you had suffered the same misfortunes. My\npeople are not wickeder than others, but for the moment they are sick\nand have no strength. As for the government of the Bolsheviki it matters\nlittle, for it will pass. Some parts of it may remain, but it is a\ngovernment of the sick and fevered, and cannot endure in health. Lenin\nmay be a good man--I do not think so, but I do not know--but if he were\nan archangel he could not alter things. Russia is mortally sick and\ntherefore all evil is unchained, and the criminals have no one to check\nthem. There is crime everywhere in the world, and the unfettered crime\nin Russia is so powerful that it stretches its hand to crime throughout\nthe globe and there is a great mobilising everywhere of wicked men. Once\nyou boasted that law was international and that the police in one land\nworked with the police of all others. To-day that is true about\ncriminals. After a war evil passions are loosed, and, since Russia is\nbroken, in her they can make their headquarters.... It is not\nBolshevism, the theory, you need fear, for that is a weak and dying\nthing. It is crime, which to-day finds its seat in my country, but is\nnot only Russian. It has no fatherland. It is as old as human nature and\nas wide as the earth.\"\n\n\"I see,\" said Sir Archie. \"Gad, here have I been vegetatin' and thinkin'\nthat all excitement had gone out of life with the war, and sometimes\neven regrettin' that the beastly old thing was over, and all the while\nthe world fairly hummin' with interest. And Loudon too!\"\n\n\"I would like your candid opinion on yon factor, Sir Archibald,\" said\nDickson.\n\n\"I can't say I ever liked him, and I've once or twice had a row with\nhim, for he used to bring his pals to shoot over Dalquharter and he\ndidn't quite play the game by me. But I know dashed little about him,\nfor I've been a lot away. Bit hairy about the heels, of course. A great\nfigure at local race-meetin's, and used to toady old Carforth and the\nhuntin' crowd. He has a pretty big reputation as a sharp lawyer and some\nof the thick-headed lairds swear by him, but Quentin never could stick\nhim. It's quite likely he's been gettin' into Queer Street, for he was\nalways speculatin' in horse-flesh, and I fancy he plunged a bit on the\nTurf. But I can't think how he got mixed up in this show.\"\n\n\"I'm positive Dobson's his brother.\"\n\n\"And put this business in his way. That would explain it all right....\nHe must be runnin' for pretty big stakes, for that kind of lad don't\ndabble in crime for six-and-eightpence.... Now for the layout. You've\ngot three men shut up in Dalquharter House, who by this time have\nprobably escaped. One of you--what's his name?--Heritage?--is in the old\nTower, and you think that _they_ think the Princess is still there and\nwill sit round the place like terriers. Sometime to-day the Danish brig\nwill arrive with reinforcements, and then there will be a hefty fight.\nWell, the first thing to be done is to get rid of Loudon's stymie with\nthe authorities. Princess, I'm going to carry you off in my car to the\nChief Constable. The second thing is for you after that to stay on here.\nIt's a deadly place on a wet day, but it's safe enough.\"\n\nSaskia shook her head and Dickson spoke for her.\n\n\"You'll no' get her to stop here. I've done my best, but she's\ndetermined to be back at Dalquharter. You see she's expecting a friend,\nand besides, if there's going to be a battle she'd like to be in it. Is\nthat so, Mem?\"\n\nSir Archie looked helplessly around him, and the sight of the girl's\nface convinced him that argument would be fruitless. \"Anyhow she must\ncome with me to the Chief Constable. Lethington's a slow bird on the\nwing, and I don't see myself convincin' him that he must get busy unless\nI can produce the Princess. Even then it may be a tough job, for it's\nSunday, and in these parts people go to sleep till Monday mornin'.\"\n\n\"That's just what I'm trying to get at,\" said Dickson. \"By all means go\nto the Chief Constable, and tell him it's life or death. My lawyer in\nGlasgow, Mr. Caw, will have been stirring him up yesterday, and you two\nshould complete the job.... But what I'm feared is that he'll not be in\ntime. As you say, it's the Sabbath day, and the police are terrible\nslow. Now any moment that brig may be here, and the trouble will start.\nI'm wanting to save the Princess, but I'm wanting too to give these\nblagyirds the roughest handling they ever got in their lives. Therefore\nI say there's no time to lose. We're far ower few to put up a fight, and\nwe want every man you've got about this place to hold the fort till the\npolice come.\"\n\nSir Archibald looked upon the earnest flushed face of Dickson with\nadmiration. \"I'm blessed if you're not the most whole-hearted brigand\nI've ever struck.\"\n\n\"I'm not. I'm just a business man.\"\n\n\"Do you realise that you're levying a private war and breaking every law\nof the land?\"\n\n\"Hoots!\" said Dickson. \"I don't care a docken about the law. I'm for\nseeing this job through. What force can you produce?\"\n\n\"Only cripples, I'm afraid. There's Sime, my butler. He was a Fusilier\nJock and, as you saw, has lost an arm. Then McGuffog the keeper is a\ngood man, but he's still got a Turkish bullet in his thigh. The\nchauffeur, Carfrae, was in the Yeomanry, and lost half a foot, and\nthere's myself, as lame as a duck. The herds on the home farm are no\ngood, for one's seventy and the other is in bed with jaundice. The Mains\ncan produce four men, but they're rather a job lot.\"\n\n\"They'll do fine,\" said Dickson heartily. \"All sodgers, and no doubt all\ngood shots. Have you plenty guns?\"\n\nSir Archie burst into uproarious laughter. \"Mr. McCunn, you're a man\nafter my own heart. I'm under your orders. If I had a boy I'd put him\ninto the provision trade, for it's the place to see fightin'. Yes, we've\nno end of guns. I advise shot-guns, for they've more stoppin' power in a\nrush than a rifle, and I take it it's a rough-and-tumble we're lookin'\nfor.\"\n\n\"Right,\" said Dickson. \"I saw a bicycle in the hall. I want you to lend\nit me, for I must be getting back. You'll take the Princess and do the\nbest you can with the Chief Constable.\"\n\n\"And then?\"\n\n\"Then you'll load up your car with your folk, and come down the hill to\nDalquharter. There'll be a laddie, or maybe more than one, waiting for\nyou on this side the village to give you instructions. Take your orders\nfrom them. If it's a red-haired ruffian called Dougal you'll be wise to\nheed what he says, for he has a grand head for battles.\"\n\nFive minutes later Dickson was pursuing a quavering course like a snipe\ndown the avenue. He was a miserable performer on a bicycle. Not for\ntwenty years had he bestridden one, and he did not understand such new\ndevices as free-wheels and change of gears. The mounting had been the\nworst part and it had only been achieved by the help of a rockery. He\nhad begun by cutting into two flower-beds, and missing a birch tree by\ninches. But he clung on desperately, well knowing that if he fell off it\nwould be hard to remount, and at length he gained the avenue. When he\npassed the lodge gates he was riding fairly straight, and when he turned\noff the Ayr highway to the side road that led to Dalquharter he was more\nor less master of his machine.\n\nHe crossed the Garple by an ancient hunch-backed bridge, observing even\nin his absorption with the handle-bars that the stream was in roaring\nspate. He wrestled up the further hill, with aching calf-muscles, and\ngot to the top just before his strength gave out. Then as the road\nturned seaward he had the slope with him, and enjoyed some respite. It\nwas no case for putting up his feet, for the gale was blowing hard on\nhis right cheek, but the downward grade enabled him to keep his course\nwith little exertion. His anxiety to get back to the scene of action was\nfor the moment appeased, since he knew he was making as good speed as\nthe weather allowed, so he had leisure for thought.\n\nBut the mind of this preposterous being was not on the business before\nhim. He dallied with irrelevant things--with the problems of youth and\nlove. He was beginning to be very nervous about Heritage, not as the\nsolitary garrison of the old Tower, but as the lover of Saskia. That\neverybody should be in love with her appeared to him only proper, for he\nhad never met her like, and assumed that it did not exist. The desire\nof the moth for the star seemed to him a reasonable thing, since\nhopeless loyalty and unrequited passion were the eternal stock-in-trade\nof romance. He wished he were twenty-five himself to have the chance of\nindulging in such sentimentality for such a lady. But Heritage was not\nlike him and would never be content with a romantic folly.... He had\nbeen in love with her for two years--a long time. He spoke about wanting\nto die for her, which was a flight beyond Dickson himself. \"I doubt it\nwill be what they call a 'grand passion,'\" he reflected with reverence.\nBut it was hopeless; he saw quite clearly that it was hopeless.\n\nWhy, he could not have explained, for Dickson's instincts were subtler\nthan his intelligence. He recognised that the two belonged to different\ncircles of being, which nowhere intersected. That mysterious lady, whose\neyes had looked through life to the other side, was no mate for the\nPoet. His faithful soul was agitated, for he had developed for Heritage\na sincere affection. It would break his heart, poor man. There was he\nholding the fort alone and cheering himself with delightful fancies\nabout one remoter than the moon. Dickson wanted happy endings, and here\nthere was no hope of such. He hated to admit that life could be crooked,\nbut the optimist in him was now fairly dashed.\n\nSir Archie might be the fortunate man, for of course he would soon be in\nlove with her, if he were not so already. Dickson like all his class had\na profound regard for the country gentry. The business Scot does not\nusually revere wealth, though he may pursue it earnestly, nor does he\nspecially admire rank in the common sense. But for ancient race he has\nrespect in his bones, though it may happen that in public he denies it,\nand the laird has for him a secular association with good family.... Sir\nArchie might do. He was young, good-looking, obviously gallant.... But\nno! He was not quite right either. Just a trifle too light in weight,\ntoo boyish and callow. The Princess must have youth, but it should be\nmighty youth, the youth of a Napoleon or a C\u00c3\u00a6sar. He reflected that the\nGreat Montrose, for whom he had a special veneration, might have filled\nthe bill. Or young Harry with his beaver up? Or Claverhouse in the\npicture with the flush of temper on his cheek?\n\nThe meditations of the match-making Dickson came to an abrupt end. He\nhad been riding negligently, his head bent against the wind, and his\neyes vaguely fixed on the wet hill-gravel of the road. Of his immediate\nenvirons he was pretty well unconscious. Suddenly he was aware of\nfigures on each side of him who advanced menacingly. Stung to activity\nhe attempted to increase his pace, which was already good, for the road\nat this point descended steeply. Then, before he could prevent it, a\nstick was thrust into his front wheel, and the next second he was\ndescribing a curve through the air. His head took the ground, he felt a\nspasm of blinding pain, and then a sense of horrible suffocation before\nhis wits left him.\n\n\"Are ye sure it's the richt man, Ecky?\" said a voice which he did not\nhear.\n\n\"Sure. It's the Glesca body Dobson telled us to look for yesterday. It's\na pund note atween us for this job. We'll tie him up in the wud till\nwe've time to attend to him.\"\n\n\"Is he bad?\"\n\n\"It doesna maitter,\" said the one called Ecky. \"He'll be deid onyway\nlong afore the morn.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMrs. Morran all forenoon was in a state of un-Sabbatical disquiet. After\nshe had seen Saskia and Dickson start she finished her housewifely\nduties, took Cousin Eug\u00c3\u00a8nie her breakfast, and made preparation for the\nmidday dinner. The invalid in the bed in the parlour was not a repaying\nsubject. Cousin Eug\u00c3\u00a8nie belonged to that type of elderly women who,\nhaving been spoiled in youth, find the rest of life fall far short of\ntheir expectations. Her voice had acquired a perpetual wail, and the\ncorners of what had once been a pretty mouth drooped in an eternal\npeevishness. She found herself in a morass of misery and shabby\ndiscomfort, but had her days continued in an even tenor she would still\nhave lamented. \"A dingy body,\" was Mrs. Morran's comment, but she\nlaboured in kindness. Unhappily they had no common language, and it was\nonly by signs that the hostess could discover her wants and show her\ngoodwill. She fed her and bathed her face, saw to the fire and left her\nto sleep. \"I'm boilin' a hen to mak' broth for your denner, Mem. Try and\nget a bit sleep now.\" The purport of the advice was clear, and Cousin\nEug\u00c3\u00a8nie turned obediently on her pillow.\n\nIt was Mrs. Morran's custom of a Sunday to spend the morning in devout\nmeditation. Some years before she had given up tramping the five miles\nto kirk, on the ground that having been a regular attendant for fifty\nyears she had got all the good out of it that was probable. Instead she\nread slowly aloud to herself the sermon printed in a certain religious\nweekly which reached her every Saturday, and concluded with a chapter or\ntwo of the Bible. But to-day something had gone wrong with her mind. She\ncould not follow the thread of the Reverend Doctor MacMichael's\ndiscourse. She could not fix her attention on the wanderings and\nmisdeeds of Israel as recorded in the Book of Exodus. She must always be\ngetting up to look at the pot on the fire, or to open the back door and\nstudy the weather. For a little she fought against her unrest, and then\nshe gave up the attempt at concentration. She took the big pot off the\nfire and allowed it to simmer, and presently she fetched her boots and\numbrella, and kilted her petticoats. \"I'll be none the waur o' a breath\no' caller air,\" she decided.\n\nThe wind was blowing great guns but there was only the thinnest sprinkle\nof rain. Sitting on the hen-house roof and munching a raw turnip was a\nfigure which she recognised as the smallest of the Die-Hards. Between\nbites he was singing dolefully to the tune of \"Annie Laurie\" one of the\nditties of his quondam Sunday school:\n\n    \"The Boorjoys' brays are bonny,\n       Too-roo-ra-roo-raloo,\n     But the Worrkers o' the Worrld\n       Wull gar them a' look blue,\n     Wull gar them a' look blue,\n       And droon them in the sea,\n     And--for bonnie Annie Laurie\n       I'll lay me down and dee.\"\n\n\"Losh, laddie,\" she cried, \"that's cauld food for the stamach. Come\nindoors about midday and I'll gie ye a plate o' broth!\" The Die-Hard\nsaluted and continued on the turnip.\n\nShe took the Auchenlochan road across the Garple bridge, for that was\nthe best road to the Mains and by it Dickson and the others might be\nreturning. Her equanimity at all seasons was like a Turk's, and she\nwould not have admitted that anything mortal had power to upset or\nexcite her: nevertheless it was a fast-beating heart that she now bore\nbeneath her Sunday jacket. Great events, she felt, were on the eve of\nhappening, and of them she was a part. Dickson's anxiety was hers, to\nbring things to a business-like conclusion. The honour of Huntingtower\nwas at stake and of the old Kennedys. She was carrying out Mr. Quentin's\ncommands, the dead boy who used to clamour for her treacle scones. And\nthere was more than duty in it, for youth was not dead in her old\nheart, and adventure had still power to quicken it.\n\nMrs. Morran walked well, with the steady long paces of the Scots\ncountrywoman. She left the Auchenlochan road and took the side path\nalong the tableland to the Mains. But for the surge of the gale and the\nfar-borne boom of the furious sea there was little noise; not a bird\ncried in the uneasy air. With the wind behind her Mrs. Morran breasted\nthe ascent till she had on her right the moorland running south to the\nLochan valley and on her left Garple chafing in its deep forested\ngorges. Her eyes were quick and she noted with interest a weasel\ncreeping from a fern-clad cairn. A little way on she passed an old ewe\nin difficulties and assisted it to rise. \"But for me, my wumman, ye'd\nhae been braxy ere nicht,\" she told it as it departed bleating. Then she\nrealised that she had come a certain distance. \"Losh, I maun be gettin'\nback or the hen will be spiled,\" she cried, and was on the verge of\nturning.\n\nBut something caught her eye a hundred yards further on the road. It was\nsomething which moved with the wind like a wounded bird, fluttering from\nthe roadside to a puddle and then back to the rushes. She advanced to\nit, missed it, and caught it.\n\nIt was an old dingy green felt hat, and she recognised it as Dickson's.\n\nMrs. Morran's brain, after a second of confusion, worked fast and\nclearly. She examined the road and saw that a little way on the gravel\nhad been violently agitated. She detected several prints of hobnailed\nboots. There were prints too, on a patch of peat on the south side\nbehind a tall bank of sods. \"That's where they were hidin',\" she\nconcluded. Then she explored on the other side in a thicket of hazels\nand wild raspberries, and presently her perseverance was rewarded. The\nscrub was all crushed and pressed as if several persons had been forcing\na passage. In a hollow was a gleam of something white. She moved towards\nit with a quaking heart, and was relieved to find that it was only a new\nand expensive bicycle with the front wheel badly buckled.\n\nMrs. Morran delayed no longer. If she had walked well on her out\njourney, she beat all records on the return. Sometimes she would run\ntill her breath failed; then she would slow down till anxiety once more\nquickened her pace. To her joy on the Dalquharter side of the Garple\nbridge she observed the figure of a Die-Hard. Breathless, flushed, with\nher bonnet awry and her umbrella held like a scimitar, she seized on the\nboy.\n\n\"Awfu' doin's! They've grippit Maister McCunn up the Mains road just\nafore the second milestone and forenent the auld bucht. I fund his hat,\nand a bicycle's lyin' broken in the wud. Haste ye, man, and get the rest\nand awa' and seek him. It'll be the tinklers frae the Dean. I'd gang\nmysel', but my legs are ower auld. Oh, laddie, dinna stop to speir\nquestions. They'll hae him murdered or awa' to sea. And maybe the leddy\nwas wi' him and they've got them baith. Wae's me! Wae's me!\"\n\nThe Die-Hard, who was Wee Jaikie, did not delay. His eyes had filled\nwith tears at her news, which we know to have been his habit. When Mrs.\nMorran, after indulging in a moment of barbaric keening, looked back the\nroad she had come, she saw a small figure trotting up the hill like a\nterrier who has been left behind. As he trotted he wept bitterly. Jaikie\nwas getting dangerous.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nHOW MR. McCUNN COMMITTED AN ASSAULT UPON AN ALLY\n\n\nDickson always maintained that his senses did not leave him for more\nthan a second or two, but he admitted that he did not remember very\nclearly the events of the next few hours. He was conscious of a bad pain\nabove his eyes, and something wet trickling down his cheek. There was a\nperpetual sound of water in his ears and of men's voices. He found\nhimself dropped roughly on the ground and forced to walk, and was aware\nthat his legs were inclined to wobble. Somebody had a grip on each arm,\nso that he could not defend his face from the brambles, and that worried\nhim, for his whole head seemed one aching bruise and he dreaded anything\ntouching it. But all the time he did not open his mouth, for silence was\nthe one duty that his muddled wits enforced. He felt that he was not the\nmaster of his mind, and he dreaded what he might disclose if he began to\nbabble.\n\nPresently there came a blank space of which he had no recollection at\nall. The movement had stopped, and he was allowed to sprawl on the\nground. He thought that his head had got another whack from a bough, and\nthat the pain put him into a stupor. When he awoke he was alone.\n\nHe discovered that he was strapped very tightly to a young Scotch fir.\nHis arms were bent behind him and his wrists tied together with cords\nknotted at the back of the tree; his legs were shackled, and further\ncords fastened them to the bole. Also there was a halter round the trunk\nand just under his chin, so that while he breathed freely enough, he\ncould not move his head. Before him was a tangle of bracken and scrub,\nand beyond that the gloom of dense pines; but as he could only see\ndirectly in front his prospect was strictly circumscribed.\n\nVery slowly he began to take his bearings. The pain in his head was now\ndulled and quite bearable, and the flow of blood had stopped, for he\nfelt the incrustation of it beginning on his cheeks. There was a\ntremendous noise all around him, and he traced this to the swaying of\ntree-tops in the gale. But there was an undercurrent of deeper\nsound--water surely, water churning among rocks. It was a stream--the\nGarple of course--and then he remembered where he was and what had\nhappened.\n\nI do not wish to portray Dickson as a hero, for nothing would annoy him\nmore; but I am bound to say that his first clear thought was not of his\nown danger. It was intense exasperation at the miscarriage of his plans.\nLong ago he should have been with Dougal arranging operations, giving\nhim news of Sir Archie, finding out how Heritage was faring, deciding\nhow to use the coming reinforcements. Instead he was trussed up in a\nwood, a prisoner of the enemy, and utterly useless to his side. He\ntugged at his bonds, and nearly throttled himself. But they were of\ngood tarry cord and did not give a fraction of an inch. Tears of bitter\nrage filled his eyes and made furrows on his encrusted cheeks. Idiot\nthat he had been, he had wrecked everything! What would Saskia and\nDougal and Sir Archie do without a business man by their side? There\nwould be a muddle, and the little party would walk into a trap. He saw\nit all very clearly. The men from the sea would overpower them, there\nwould be murder done, and an easy capture of the Princess; and the\npolice would turn up at long last to find an empty headland.\n\nHe had also most comprehensively wrecked himself, and at the thought the\nmost genuine panic seized him. There was no earthly chance of escape,\nfor he was tucked away in this infernal jungle till such time as his\nenemies had time to deal with him. As to what that dealing would be like\nhe had no doubts, for they knew that he had been their chief opponent.\nThose desperate ruffians would not scruple to put an end to him. His\nmind dwelt with horrible fascination upon throat-cutting, no doubt\nbecause of the presence of the cord below his chin. He had heard it was\nnot a painful death; at any rate he remembered a clerk he had once had,\na feeble, timid creature, who had twice attempted suicide that way.\nSurely it could not be very bad, and it would soon be over.\n\nBut another thought came to him. They would carry him off in the ship\nand settle with him at their leisure. No swift merciful death for him.\nHe had read dreadful tales of the Bolsheviks' skill in torture, and now\nthey all came back to him--stories of Chinese mercenaries, and men\nburied alive, and death by agonising inches. He felt suddenly very cold\nand sick, and hung in his bonds for he had no strength in his limbs.\nThen the pressure on his throat braced him, and also quickened his numb\nmind. The liveliest terror ran like quicksilver through his veins.\n\nHe endured some moments of this anguish, till after many despairing\nclutches at his wits he managed to attain a measure of self-control. He\ncertainly wasn't going to allow himself to become mad. Death was death\nwhatever form it took, and he had to face death as many better men had\ndone before him. He had often thought about it and wondered how he\nshould behave if the thing came to him. Respectably, he had hoped;\nheroically, he had sworn in his moments of confidence. But he had never\nfor an instant dreamed of this cold, lonely, dreadful business. Last\nSunday, he remembered, he had been basking in the afternoon sun in his\nlittle garden and reading about the end of Fergus MacIvor in _Waverley_\nand thrilling to the romance of it; and then Tibby had come out and\nsummoned him in to tea. Then he had rather wanted to be a Jacobite in\nthe '45 and in peril of his neck, and now Providence had taken him most\nterribly at his word.\n\nA week ago----! He groaned at the remembrance of that sunny garden. In\nseven days he had found a new world and tried a new life, and had come\nnow to the end of it. He did not want to die, less now than ever with\nsuch wide horizons opening before him. But that was the worst of it, he\nreflected, for to have a great life great hazards must be taken, and\nthere was always the risk of this sudden extinguisher.... Had he to\nchoose again, far better the smooth sheltered bypath than this accursed\nromantic highway on to which he had blundered.... No, by Heaven, no!\nConfound it, if he had to choose he would do it all again. Something\nstiff and indomitable in his soul was bracing him to a manlier humour.\nThere was no one to see the figure strapped to the fir, but had there\nbeen a witness he would have noted that at this stage Dickson shut his\nteeth and that his troubled eyes looked very steadily before him.\n\nHis business, he felt, was to keep from thinking, for if he thought at\nall there would be a flow of memories, of his wife, his home, his books,\nhis friends, to unman him. So he steeled himself to blankness, like a\nsleepless man imagining white sheep in a gate.... He noted a robin below\nthe hazels, strutting impudently. And there was a tit on a bracken\nfrond, which made the thing sway like one of the see-saws he used to\nplay with as a boy. There was no wind in that undergrowth, and any\nmovement must be due to bird or beast. The tit flew off, and the\noscillations of the bracken slowly died away. Then they began again, but\nmore violently, and Dickson could not see the bird that caused them. It\nmust be something down at the roots of the covert, a rabbit, perhaps, or\na fox, or a weasel.\n\nHe watched for the first sign of the beast, and thought he caught a\nglimpse of tawny fur. Yes, there it was--pale dirty yellow, a weasel\nclearly. Then suddenly the patch grew larger, and to his amazement he\nlooked at a human face--the face of a pallid small boy.\n\nA head disentangled itself, followed by thin shoulders, and then by a\npair of very dirty bare legs. The figure raised itself and looked\nsharply round to make certain that the coast was clear. Then it stood up\nand saluted, revealing the well-known lineaments of Wee Jaikie.\n\nAt the sight Dickson knew that he was safe by that certainty of instinct\nwhich is independent of proof, like the man who prays for a sign and has\nhis prayer answered. He observed that the boy was quietly sobbing.\nJaikie surveyed the position for an instant with red-rimmed eyes and\nthen unclasped a knife, feeling the edge of the blade on his thumb. He\ndarted behind the fir, and a second later Dickson's wrists were free.\nThen he sawed at the legs, and cut the shackles which tied them\ntogether, and then--most circumspectly--assaulted the cord which bound\nDickson's neck to the trunk. There now remained only the two bonds which\nfastened the legs and the body to the tree.\n\nThere was a sound in the wood different from the wind and stream. Jaikie\nlistened like a startled hind.\n\n\"They're comin' back,\" he gasped. \"Just you bide where ye are and let on\nye're still tied up.\"\n\nHe disappeared in the scrub as inconspicuously as a rat, while two of\nthe tinklers came up the slope from the waterside. Dickson in a fever of\nimpatience cursed Wee Jaikie for not cutting his remaining bonds so that\nhe could at least have made a dash for freedom. And then he realised\nthat the boy had been right. Feeble and cramped as he was, he would have\nstood no chance in a race.\n\nOne of the tinklers was the man called Ecky. He had been running hard,\nand was mopping his brow.\n\n\"Hob's seen the brig,\" he said. \"It's droppin' anchor ayont the Dookits\nwhaur there's a beild frae the wund and deep water. They'll be landit in\nhalf an 'oor. Awa' you up to the Hoose and tell Dobson, and me and Sim\nand Hob will meet the boats at the Garplefit.\"\n\nThe other cast a glance towards Dickson.\n\n\"What about him?\" he asked.\n\nThe two scrutinised their prisoner from a distance of a few paces.\nDickson, well aware of his peril, held himself as stiff as if every bond\nhad been in place. The thought flashed on him that if he were too\nimmobile they might think he was dying or dead, and come close to\nexamine him. If they only kept their distance, the dusk of the wood\nwould prevent them detecting Jaikie's handiwork.\n\n\"What'll you take to let me go?\" he asked plaintively.\n\n\"Naething that you could offer, my mannie,\" said Ecky.\n\n\"I'll give you a five-pound note apiece.\"\n\n\"Produce the siller,\" said the other.\n\n\"It's in my pocket.\"\n\n\"It's no' that. We riped your pooches lang syne.\"\n\n\"I'll take you to Glasgow with me and pay you there. Honour bright.\"\n\nEcky spat. \"D'ye think we're gowks? Man, there's no siller ye could pay\nwad mak' it worth our while to lowse ye. Bide quiet there and ye'll see\nsome queer things ere nicht. C'way, Davie.\"\n\nThe two set off at a good pace down the stream, while Dickson's pulsing\nheart returned to its normal rhythm. As the sound of their feet died\naway Wee Jaikie crawled out from cover, dry-eyed now and very\nbusiness-like. He slit the last thongs, and Dickson fell limply on his\nface.\n\n\"Losh, laddie, I'm awful stiff,\" he groaned. \"Now, listen. Away all your\npith to Dougal, and tell him that the brig's in and the men will be\nlanding inside the hour. Tell him I'm coming as fast as my legs will let\nme. The Princess will likely be there already and Sir Archibald and his\nmen, but if they're no', tell Dougal they're coming. Haste you, Jaikie.\nAnd see here, I'll never forget what you've done for me the day. You're\na fine wee laddie!\"\n\nThe obedient Die-Hard disappeared, and Dickson painfully and laboriously\nset himself to climb the slope. He decided that his quickest and safest\nroute lay by the highroad, and he had also some hopes of recovering his\nbicycle. On examining his body he seemed to have sustained no very great\ndamage, except a painful cramping of legs and arms and a certain\ndizziness in the head. His pockets had been thoroughly rifled, and he\nreflected with amusement that he, the well-to-do Mr. McCunn, did not\npossess at the moment a single copper.\n\nBut his spirits were soaring, for somehow his escape had given him an\nassurance of ultimate success. Providence had directly interfered on his\nbehalf by the hand of Wee Jaikie, and that surely meant that it would\nsee him through. But his chief emotion was an ardour of impatience to\nget to the scene of action. He must be at Dalquharter before the men\nfrom the sea; he must find Dougal and discover his dispositions.\nHeritage would be on guard in the Tower and in a very little the enemy\nwould be round it. It would be just like the Princess to try and enter\nthere, but at all costs that must be hindered. She and Sir Archie must\nnot be cornered in stone walls, but must keep their communications open\nand fall on the enemy's flank. Oh, if the police would only come in\ntime, what a rounding-up of miscreants that day would see!\n\nAs the trees thinned on the brow of the slope and he saw the sky, he\nrealised that the afternoon was far advanced. It must be well on for\nfive o'clock. The wind still blew furiously, and the oaks on the fringes\nof the wood were whipped like saplings. Ruefully he admitted that the\ngale would not defeat the enemy. If the brig found a sheltered anchorage\non the south side of the headland beyond the Garple, it would be easy\nenough for boats to make the Garple mouth, though it might be a\ndifficult job to get out again. The thought quickened his steps, and he\ncame out of cover on to the public road without a prior reconnaissance.\n\nJust in front of him stood a motor-bicycle. Something had gone wrong\nwith it for its owner was tinkering at it, on the side farthest from\nDickson. A wild hope seized him that this might be the vanguard of the\npolice, and he went boldly towards it. The owner, who was kneeling,\nraised his face at the sound of footsteps and Dickson looked into his\neyes.\n\nHe recognised them only too well. They belonged to the man he had seen\nin the inn at Kirkmichael, the man whom Heritage had decided was an\nAustralian, but whom they now knew to be their arch-enemy--the man\ncalled Paul who had persecuted the Princess for years and whom alone of\nall beings on earth she feared. He had been expected before, but had\narrived now in the nick of time while the brig was casting anchor.\nSaskia had said that he had a devil's brain, and Dickson, as he stared\nat him, saw a fiendish cleverness in his straight brows and a\nremorseless cruelty in his stiff jaw and his pale eyes.\n\nHe achieved the bravest act of his life. Shaky and dizzy as he was, with\nfreedom newly opened to him and the mental torments of his captivity\nstill an awful recollection, he did not hesitate. He saw before him the\nvillain of the drama, the one man that stood between the Princess and\npeace of mind. He regarded no consequences, gave no heed to his own\nfate, and thought only how to put his enemy out of action. There was a\nbig spanner lying on the ground. He seized it and with all his strength\nsmote at the man's face.\n\nThe motor-cyclist, kneeling and working hard at his machine, had raised\nhis head at Dickson's approach and beheld a wild apparition--a short man\nin ragged tweeds, with a bloody brow and long smears of blood on his\ncheeks. The next second he observed the threat of attack, and ducked his\nhead so that the spanner only grazed his scalp. The motor-bicycle\ntoppled over, its owner sprang to his feet, and found the short man,\nvery pale and gasping, about to renew the assault. In such a crisis\nthere was no time for inquiry, and the cyclist was well trained in\nself-defence. He leaped the prostrate bicycle, and before his assailant\ncould get in a blow brought his left fist into violent contact with his\nchin. Dickson tottered back a step or two and then subsided among the\nbracken.\n\nHe did not lose his senses, but he had no more strength in him. He felt\nhorribly ill, and struggled in vain to get up. The cyclist, a gigantic\nfigure, towered above him. \"Who the devil are you?\" he was asking. \"What\ndo you mean by it?\"\n\nDickson had no breath for words, and knew that if he tried to speak he\nwould be very sick. He could only stare up like a dog at the angry eyes.\nAngry beyond question they were, but surely not malevolent. Indeed, as\nthey looked at the shameful figure on the ground, amusement filled them.\nThe face relaxed into a smile.\n\n\"Who on earth are you?\" the voice repeated. And then into it came\nrecognition. \"I've seen you before. I believe you're the little man I\nsaw last week at the Black Bull. Be so good as to explain why you want\nto murder me?\"\n\nExplanation was beyond Dickson, but his conviction was being wofully\nshaken. Saskia had said her enemy was as beautiful as a devil--he\nremembered the phrase, for he had thought it ridiculous. This man was\nmagnificent, but there was nothing devilish in his lean grave face.\n\n\"What's your name?\" the voice was asking.\n\n\"Tell me yours first,\" Dickson essayed to stutter between spasms of\nnausea.\n\n\"My name is Alexander Nicholson,\" was the answer.\n\n\"Then you're no' the man.\" It was a cry of wrath and despair.\n\n\"You're a very desperate little chap. For whom had I the honour to be\nmistaken?\"\n\nDickson had now wriggled into a sitting position and had clasped his\nhands above his aching head.\n\n\"I thought you were a Russian, name of Paul,\" he groaned.\n\n\"Paul! Paul who?\"\n\n\"Just Paul. A Bolshevik and an awful bad lot.\"\n\nDickson could not see the change which his words wrought in the other's\nface. He found himself picked up in strong arms and carried to a\nbog-pool where his battered face was carefully washed, his throbbing\nbrows laved, and a wet handkerchief bound over them. Then he was given\nbrandy in the socket of a flask, which eased his nausea. The cyclist ran\nhis bicycle to the roadside, and found a seat for Dickson behind the\nturf-dyke of the old bucht.\n\n\"Now you are going to tell me everything,\" he said. \"If the Paul who is\nyour enemy is the Paul I think him, then we are allies.\"\n\nBut Dickson did not need this assurance. His mind had suddenly received\na revelation. The Princess had expected an enemy, but also a friend.\nMight not this be the long-awaited friend, for whose sake she was rooted\nto Huntingtower with all its terrors?\n\n\"Are you sure you name's no' Alexis?\" he asked.\n\n\"In my own country I was called Alexis Nicolaevitch, for I am a Russian.\nBut for some years I have made my home with your folk, and I call myself\nAlexander Nicholson, which is the English form. Who told you about\nAlexis?\"\n\n\"Give me your hand,\" said Dickson shamefacedly. \"Man, she's been looking\nfor you for weeks. You're terribly behind the fair.\"\n\n\"She!\" he cried. \"For God's sake tell me all you know.\"\n\n\"Ay, she--the Princess. But what are we havering here for? I tell you at\nthis moment she's somewhere down about the old Tower, and there's\nboatloads of blagyirds landing from the sea. Help me up, man, for I must\nbe off. The story will keep. Losh, it's very near the darkening. If\nyou're Alexis, you're just about in time for a battle.\"\n\nBut Dickson on his feet was but a frail creature. He was still\ndeplorably giddy, and his legs showed an unpleasing tendency to crumple.\n\"I'm fair done,\" he moaned. \"You see, I've been tied up all day to a\ntree and had two sore bashes on my head. Get you on that bicycle and\nhurry on, and I'll hirple after you the best I can. I'll direct you the\nroad, and if you're lucky you'll find a Die-Hard about the village. Away\nwith you, man, and never mind me.\"\n\n\"We go together,\" said the other quietly. \"You can sit behind me and\nhang on to my waist. Before you turned up I had pretty well got the\nthing in order.\"\n\nDickson in a fever of impatience sat by while the Russian put the\nfinishing touches to the machine, and as well as his anxiety allowed put\nhim in possession of the main facts of the story. He told of how he and\nHeritage had come to Dalquharter, of the first meeting with Saskia, of\nthe trip to Glasgow with the jewels, of the exposure of Loudon the\nfactor, of last night's doings in the House, and of the journey that\nmorning to the Mains of Garple. He sketched the figures on the\nscene--Heritage and Sir Archie, Dobson and his gang, the Gorbals\nDie-Hards. He told of the enemy's plans so far as he knew them.\n\n\"Looked at from a business point of view,\" he said, \"the situation's\nlike this. There's Heritage in the Tower, with Dobson, L\u00c3\u00a9on and Spidel\nsitting round him. Somewhere about the place there's the Princess and\nSir Archibald and three men with guns from the Mains. Dougal and his\nfive laddies are running loose in the policies. And there's four\ntinklers and God knows how many foreign ruffians pushing up from the\nGarplefoot, and a brig lying waiting to carry off the ladies. Likewise\nthere's the police, somewhere on the road, though the dear kens when\nthey'll turn up. It's awful the incompetence of our Government, and the\nrates and taxes that high!... And there's you and me by this roadside,\nand I'm no more use than a tattie-bogle.... That's the situation, and\nthe question is what's our plan to be? We must keep the blagyirds in\nplay till the police come, and at the same time we must keep the\nPrincess out of danger. That's why I'm wanting back, for they've sore\nneed of a business head. Yon Sir Archibald's a fine fellow, but I doubt\nhe'll be a bit rash, and the Princess is no' to hold or bind. Our first\njob is to find Dougal and get a grip of the facts.\"\n\n\"I am going to the Princess,\" said the Russian.\n\n\"Ay, that'll be best. You'll be maybe able to manage her, for you'll be\nwell acquaint.\"\n\n\"She is my kinswoman. She is also my affianced wife.\"\n\n\"Keep us!\" Dickson exclaimed, with a doleful thought of Heritage. \"What\nailed you then no' to look after her better?\"\n\n\"We have been long separated, because it was her will. She had work to\ndo and disappeared from me, though I searched all Europe for her. Then\nshe sent me word, when the danger became extreme, and summoned me to her\naid. But she gave me poor directions, for she did not know her own plans\nvery clearly. She spoke of a place called Darkwater, and I have been\nhunting half Scotland for it. It was only last night that I heard of\nDalquharter and guessed that that might be the name. But I was far down\nin Galloway, and have ridden fifty miles to-day.\"\n\n\"It's a queer thing, but I wouldn't take you for a Russian.\"\n\nAlexis finished his work and put away his tools. \"For the present,\" he\nsaid, \"I am an Englishman, till my country comes again to her senses.\nTen years ago I left Russia, for I was sick of the foolishness of my\nclass and wanted a free life in a new world. I went to Australia and\nmade good as an engineer. I am a partner in a firm which is pretty well\nknown even in Britain. When war broke out I returned to fight for my\npeople, and when Russia fell out of the war, I joined the Australians in\nFrance and fought with them till the Armistice. And now I have only one\nduty left, to save the Princess and take her with me to my new home till\nRussia is a nation once more.\"\n\nDickson whistled joyfully. \"So Mr. Heritage was right. He aye said you\nwere an Australian.... And you're a business man! That's grand hearing\nand puts my mind at rest. You must take charge of the party at the\nHouse, for Sir Archibald's a daft young lad and Mr. Heritage is a poet.\nI thought I would have to go myself, but I doubt I would just be a\nhindrance with my dwaibly legs. I'd be better outside, watching for the\npolice.... Are you ready, sir?\"\n\nDickson not without difficulty perched himself astride the luggage\ncarrier, firmly grasping the rider round the middle. The machine\nstarted, but it was evidently in a bad way, for it made poor going till\nthe descent towards the main Auchenlochan road. On the slope it warmed\nup and they crossed the Garple bridge at a fair pace. There was to be no\npleasant April twilight, for the stormy sky had already made dusk, and\nin a very little the dark would fall. So sombre was the evening that\nDickson did not notice a figure in the shadow of the roadside pines till\nit whistled shrilly on its fingers. He cried on Alexis to stop, and,\nthis being accomplished with some suddenness, fell off at Dougal's feet.\n\n\"What's the news?\" he demanded.\n\nDougal glanced at Alexis and seemed to approve his looks.\n\n\"Napoleon has just reported that three boatloads, making either\ntwenty-three or twenty-four men--they were gey ill to count--has landed\nat Garplefit and is makin' their way to the auld Tower. The tinklers\nwarned Dobson and soon it'll be a' bye wi' Heritage.\"\n\n\"The Princess is not there?\" was Dickson's anxious inquiry.\n\n\"Na, na. Heritage is there his lone. They were for joinin' him, but I\nwouldn't let them. She came wi' a man they call Sir Erchibald and three\ngemkeepers wi' guns. I stoppit their cawr up the road and tell't them\nthe lie o' the land. Yon Sir Erchibald has poor notions o' strawtegy. He\nwas for bangin' into the auld Tower straight away and shootin' Dobson if\nhe tried to stop them. 'Havers,' say I, 'let them break their teeth on\nthe Tower, thinkin' the leddy's inside, and that'll give us time, for\nHeritage is no' the lad to surrender in a hurry.'\"\n\n\"Where are they now?\"\n\n\"In the Hoose o' Dalquharter, and a sore job I had gettin' them in.\nWe've shifted our base again, without the enemy suspectin'.\"\n\n\"Any word of the police?\"\n\n\"The polis!\" and Dougal spat cynically. \"It seems they're a dour crop to\nshift. Sir Erchibald was sayin' that him and the lassie had been to the\nChief Constable, but the man was terrible auld and slow. They convertit\nhim, but he threepit that it would take a long time to collect his men\nand that there was no danger o' the brig landin' afore night. He's wrong\nthere onyway, for they're landit.\"\n\n\"Dougal,\" said Dickson, \"you've heard the Princess speak of a friend she\nwas expecting here called Alexis. This is him. You can address him as\nMr. Nicholson. Just arrived in the nick of time. You must get him into\nthe House, for he's the best right to be beside the lady.... Jaikie\nwould tell you that I've been sore mishandled the day, and am no' very\nfit for a battle. But Mr. Nicholson's a business man and he'll do as\nwell. You're keeping the Die-Hards outside, I hope?\"\n\n\"Ay. Thomas Yownie's in charge, and Jaikie will be in and out with\norders. They've instructions to watch for the polis, and keep an eye on\nthe Garplefit. It's a mortal long front to hold, but there's no other\nway. I must be in the Hoose mysel'. Thomas Yownie's headquarters is the\nauld wife's hen-hoose.\"\n\nAt that moment in a pause of the gale came the far-borne echo of a shot.\n\n\"Pistol,\" said Alexis.\n\n\"Heritage,\" said Dougal. \"Trade will be gettin' brisk with him. Start\nyour machine and I'll hang on ahint. We'll try the road by the West\nLodge.\"\n\nPresently the pair disappeared in the dusk, the noise of the engine was\nswallowed up in the wild orchestra of the wind, and Dickson hobbled\ntowards the village in a state of excitement which made him oblivious of\nhis wounds. That lonely pistol shot was, he felt, the bell to ring up\nthe curtain on the last act of the play.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\nTHE COMING OF THE DANISH BRIG\n\n\nMr. John Heritage, solitary in the old Tower, found much to occupy his\nmind. His giddiness was passing, though the dregs of a headache\nremained, and his spirits rose with his responsibilities. At daybreak he\nbreakfasted out of the Mearns Street provision box, and made tea in one\nof the Die-Hards' camp kettles. Next he gave some attention to his\ntoilet, necessary after the rough-and-tumble of the night. He made shift\nto bathe in icy water from the Tower well, shaved, tidied up his clothes\nand found a clean shirt from his pack. He carefully brushed his hair,\nreminding himself that thus had the Spartans done before Thermopyl\u00c3\u00a6. The\nneat and somewhat pallid young man that emerged from these rites then\nascended to the first floor to reconnoitre the landscape from the narrow\nunglazed windows.\n\nIf any one had told him a week ago that he would be in so strange a\nworld he would have quarrelled violently with his informant. A week ago\nhe was a cynical clear-sighted modern, a contemner of illusions, a\nswallower of formulas, a breaker of shams--one who had seen through the\nheroical and found it silly. Romance and such-like toys were playthings\nfor fatted middle-age, not for strenuous and cold-eyed youth. But the\ntruth was that now he was altogether spellbound by these toys. To think\nthat he was serving his lady was rapture--ecstasy, that for her he was\nsingle-handed venturing all. He rejoiced to be alone with his private\nfancies. His one fear was that the part he had cast himself for should\nbe needless, that the men from the sea should not come, or that\nreinforcements would arrive before he should be called upon. He hoped\nalone to make a stand against thousands. What the upshot might be he did\nnot trouble to inquire. Of course the Princess would be saved, but first\nhe must glut his appetite for the heroic.\n\nHe made a diary of events that day, just as he used to do at the front.\nAt twenty minutes past eight he saw the first figure coming from the\nHouse. It was Spidel, who limped round the Tower, tried the door, and\ncame to a halt below the window. Heritage stuck out his head and wished\nhim good morning, getting in reply an amazed stare. The man was not\ndisposed to talk, though Heritage made some interesting observations on\nthe weather, but departed quicker than he came, in the direction of the\nWest Lodge.\n\nJust before nine o'clock he returned with Dobson and L\u00c3\u00a9on. They made a\nvery complete reconnaissance of the Tower, and for a moment Heritage\nthought that they were about to try to force an entrance. They tugged\nand hammered at the great oak door, which he had further strengthened by\nerecting behind it a pile of the heaviest lumber he could find in the\nplace. It was imperative that they should not get in, and he got\nDickson's pistol ready with the firm intention of shooting them if\nnecessary. But they did nothing, except to hold a conference in the\nhazel clump a hundred yards to the north, when Dobson seemed to be\nlaying down the law, and L\u00c3\u00a9on spoke rapidly with a great fluttering of\nhands. They were obviously puzzled by the sight of Heritage, whom they\nbelieved to have left the neighbourhood. Then Dobson went off, leaving\nL\u00c3\u00a9on and Spidel on guard, one at the edge of the shrubberies between the\nTower and the House, the other on the side nearest the Laver glen. These\nwere their posts, but they did sentry-go around the building, and passed\nso close to Heritage's window that he could have tossed a cigarette on\ntheir heads.\n\nIt occurred to him that he ought to get busy with camouflage. They must\nbe convinced that the Princess was in the place, for he wanted their\nwhole mind to be devoted to the siege. He rummaged among the ladies'\nbaggage, and extracted a skirt and a coloured scarf. The latter he\nmanaged to flutter so that it could be seen at the window the next time\none of the watchers came within sight. He also fixed up the skirt so\nthat the fringe of it could be seen, and, when L\u00c3\u00a9on appeared below, he\nwas in the shadow talking rapid French in a very fair imitation of the\ntones of Cousin Eug\u00c3\u00a8nie. The ruse had its effect, for L\u00c3\u00a9on promptly went\noff to tell Spidel, and when Dobson appeared he too was given the news.\nThis seemed to settle their plans, for all three remained on guard,\nDobson nearest to the Tower, seated on an outcrop of rock with his\nmackintosh collar turned up, and his eyes usually turned to the misty\nsea.\n\nBy this time it was eleven o'clock, and the next three hours passed\nslowly with Heritage. He fell to picturing the fortunes of his friends.\nDickson and the Princess should by this time be far inland, out of\ndanger and in the way of finding succour. He was confident that they\nwould return, but he trusted not too soon, for he hoped for a run for\nhis money as Horatius in the Gate. After that he was a little torn in\nhis mind. He wanted the Princess to come back and to be somewhere near\nif there was a fight going, so that she might be a witness of his\ndevotion. But she must not herself run any risk, and he became anxious\nwhen he remembered her terrible sangfroid. Dickson could no more\nrestrain her than a child could hold a greyhound.... But of course it\nwould never come to that. The police would turn up long before the brig\nappeared--Dougal had thought that would not be till high tide, between\nfour and five--and the only danger would be to the pirates. The three\nwatchers would be put in the bag, and the men from the sea would walk\ninto a neat trap. This reflection seemed to take all the colour out of\nHeritage's prospect. Peril and heroism were not to be his lot--only\nboredom.\n\nA little after twelve two of the tinklers appeared with some news which\nmade Dobson laugh and pat them on the shoulder. He seemed to be giving\nthem directions, pointing seaward and southward. He nodded to the Tower,\nwhere Heritage took the opportunity of again fluttering Saskia's scarf\nathwart the window. The tinklers departed at a trot, and Dobson lit his\npipe as if well pleased. He had some trouble with it in the wind, which\nhad risen to an uncanny violence. Even the solid Tower rocked with it,\nand the sea was a waste of spindrift and low scurrying cloud. Heritage\ndiscovered a new anxiety--this time about the possibility of the brig\nlanding at all. He wanted a complete bag, and it would be tragic if they\ngot only the three seedy ruffians now circumambulating his fortress.\n\nAbout one o'clock he was greatly cheered by the sight of Dougal. At the\nmoment Dobson was lunching off a hunk of bread and cheese directly\nbetween the Tower and the House, just short of the crest of the ridge on\nthe other side of which lay the stables and the shrubberies; L\u00c3\u00a9on was on\nthe north side opposite the Tower door, and Spidel was at the south end\nnear the edge of the Garple glen. Heritage, watching the ridge behind\nDobson and the upper windows of the House which appeared over it, saw on\nthe very crest something like a tuft of rusty bracken which he had not\nnoticed before. Presently the tuft moved, and a hand shot up from it\nwaving a rag of some sort. Dobson at the moment was engaged with a\nbottle of porter, and Heritage could safely wave a hand in reply. He\ncould now make out clearly the red head of Dougal.\n\nThe Chieftain, having located the three watchers, proceeded to give an\nexhibition of his prowess for the benefit of the lonely inmate of the\nTower. Using as cover a drift of bracken, he wormed his way down till\nhe was not six yards from Dobson, and Heritage had the privilege of\nseeing his grinning countenance a very little way above the innkeeper's\nhead. Then he crawled back and reached the neighbourhood of L\u00c3\u00a9on, who\nwas sitting on a fallen Scotch fir. At that moment it occurred to the\nBelgian to visit Dobson. Heritage's breath stopped, but Dougal was\nready, and froze into a motionless blur in the shadow of a hazel bush.\nThen he crawled very fast into the hollow where L\u00c3\u00a9on had been sitting,\nseized something which looked like a bottle, and scrambled back to the\nridge. At the top he waved the object, whatever it was, but Heritage\ncould not reply, for Dobson happened to be looking towards the window.\nThat was the last he saw of the Chieftain, but presently he realised\nwhat was the booty he had annexed. It must be L\u00c3\u00a9on's life-preserver,\nwhich the night before had broken Heritage's head.\n\nAfter that cheering episode boredom again set in. He collected some food\nfrom the Mearns Street box, and indulged himself with a glass of liqueur\nbrandy. He was beginning to feel miserably cold, so he carried up some\nbroken wood and made a fire on the immense hearth in the upper chamber.\nAnxiety was clouding his mind again, for it was now two o'clock, and\nthere was no sign of the reinforcements which Dickson and the Princess\nhad gone to find. The minutes passed, and soon it was three o'clock, and\nfrom the window he saw only the top of the gaunt shuttered House, now\nand then hidden by squalls of sleet, and Dobson squatted like an\nEskimo, and trees dancing like a witch-wood in the gale. All the vigour\nof the morning seemed to have gone out of his blood; he felt lonely and\napprehensive and puzzled. He wished he had Dickson beside him, for that\nlittle man's cheerful voice and complacent triviality would be a\ncomfort.... Also, he was abominably cold. He put on his waterproof, and\nturned his attention to the fire. It needed re-kindling, and he hunted\nin his pockets for paper, finding only the slim volume lettered\n_Whorls_.\n\nI set it down as the most significant commentary on his state of mind.\nHe regarded the book with intense disfavour, tore it in two, and used a\nhandful of its fine deckle-edged leaves to get the fire going. They\nburned well, and presently the rest followed. Well for Dickson's peace\nof mind that he was not a witness of such vandalism.\n\nA little warmer but in no way more cheerful, he resumed his watch near\nthe window. The day was getting darker, and promised an early dusk. His\nwatch told him that it was after four, and still nothing had happened.\nWhere on earth were Dickson and the Princess? Where in the name of all\nthat was holy were the police? Any minute now the brig might arrive and\nland its men, and he would be left there as a burnt-offering to their\nwrath. There must have been an infernal muddle somewhere.... Anyhow the\nPrincess was out of the trouble, but where the Lord alone knew....\nPerhaps the reinforcements were lying in wait for the boats at the\nGarplefoot. That struck him as a likely explanation, and comforted him.\nVery soon he might hear the sound of an engagement to the south, and the\nnext thing would be Dobson and his crew in flight. He was determined to\nbe in the show somehow and would be very close on their heels. He felt a\npeculiar dislike to all three, but especially to L\u00c3\u00a9on. The Belgian's\nsmall baby features had for four days set him clenching his fists when\nhe thought of them.\n\nThe next thing he saw was one of the tinklers running hard towards the\nTower. He cried something to Dobson, which Heritage could not catch, but\nwhich woke the latter to activity. The innkeeper shouted to L\u00c3\u00a9on and\nSpidel, and the tinkler was excitedly questioned. Dobson laughed and\nslapped his thigh. He gave orders to the others, and himself joined the\ntinkler and hurried off in the direction of the Garplefoot. Something\nwas happening there, something of ill omen, for the man's face and\nmanner had been triumphant. Were the boats landing?\n\nAs Heritage puzzled over this event, another figure appeared on the\nscene. It was a big man in knickerbockers and mackintosh, who came round\nthe end of the House from the direction of the South Lodge. At first he\nthought it was the advance-guard from his own side, the help which\nDickson had gone to find, and he only restrained himself in time from\nshouting a welcome. But surely their supports would not advance so\nconfidently in enemy country. The man strode over the slopes as if\nlooking for somebody; then he caught sight of L\u00c3\u00a9on and waved him to\ncome. L\u00c3\u00a9on must have known him, for he hastened to obey.\n\nThe two were about thirty yards from Heritage's window. L\u00c3\u00a9on was telling\nsome story volubly, pointing now to the Tower and now towards the sea.\nThe big man nodded as if satisfied. Heritage noted that his right arm\nwas tied up, and that the mackintosh sleeve was empty, and that brought\nhim enlightenment. It was Loudon the factor, whom Dickson had winged the\nnight before. The two of them passed out of view in the direction of\nSpidel.\n\nThe sight awoke Heritage to the supreme unpleasantness of his position.\nHe was utterly alone on the headland, and his allies had vanished into\nspace, while the enemy plans, moving like clock-work, were approaching\ntheir consummation. For a second he thought of leaving the Tower and\nhiding somewhere in the cliffs. He dismissed the notion unwillingly, for\nhe remembered the task that had been set him. He was there to hold the\nfort to the last--to gain time, though he could not for the life of him\nsee what use time was to be when all the strategy of his own side seemed\nto have miscarried. Anyhow, the blackguards would be sold for they would\nnot find the Princess. But he felt a horrid void in the pit of his\nstomach, and a looseness about his knees.\n\nThe moments passed more quickly as he wrestled with his fears. The next\nhe knew the empty space below his window was filling with figures. There\nwas a great crowd of them, rough fellows with seamen's coats, still\ndripping as if they had had a wet landing. Dobson was with them, but\nfor the rest they were strange figures.\n\nNow that the expected had come at last Heritage's nerves grew calmer. He\nmade out that the newcomers were trying the door, and he waited to hear\nit fall, for such a mob could soon force it. But instead a voice called\nfrom beneath.\n\n\"Will you please open to us?\" it said.\n\nHe stuck his head out and saw a little group with one man at the head of\nit, a young man clad in oilskins whose face was dim in the murky\nevening. The voice was that of a gentleman.\n\n\"I have orders to open to no one,\" Heritage replied.\n\n\"Then I fear we must force an entrance,\" said the voice.\n\n\"You can go to the devil,\" said Heritage.\n\nThat defiance was the screw which his nerves needed. His temper had\nrisen, he had forgotten all about the Princess, he did not even remember\nhis isolation. His job was to make a fight for it. He ran up the\nstaircase which led to the attics of the Tower, for he recollected that\nthere was a window there which looked over the ground before the door.\nThe place was ruinous, the floor filled with holes, and a part of the\nroof sagged down in a corner. The stones around the window were loose\nand crumbling and he managed to pull several out so that the slit was\nenlarged. He found himself looking down on a crowd of men, who had\nlifted the fallen tree on which L\u00c3\u00a9on had perched, and were about to use\nit as a battering ram.\n\n\"The first fellow who comes within six yards of the door I shoot,\" he\nshouted.\n\nThere was a white wave below as every face was turned to him. He ducked\nback his head in time as a bullet chipped the side of the window.\n\nBut his position was a good one, for he had a hole in the broken wall\nthrough which he could see, and could shoot with his hand at the edge of\nthe window while keeping his body in cover. The battering party resumed\ntheir task, and as the tree swung nearer, he fired at the foremost of\nthem. He missed, but the shot for a moment suspended operations.\n\nAgain they came on, and again he fired. This time he damaged somebody,\nfor the trunk was dropped.\n\nA voice gave orders, a sharp authoritative voice. The battering squad\ndissolved, and there was a general withdrawal out of the line of fire\nfrom the window. Was it possible that he had intimidated them? He could\nhear the sound of voices, and then a single figure came into sight\nagain, holding something in its hand.\n\nHe did not fire, for he recognised the futility of his efforts. The\nbaseball swing of the figure below could not be mistaken. There was a\nroar beneath, and a flash of fire, as the bomb exploded on the door.\nThen came a rush of men, and the Tower had fallen.\n\nHeritage clambered through a hole in the roof and gained the topmost\nparapet. He had still a pocketful of cartridges, and there in a coign of\nthe old battlements he would prove an ugly customer to the pursuit.\nOnly one at a time could reach that siege perilous.... They would not\ntake long to search the lower rooms, and then would be hot on the trail\nof the man who had fooled them. He had not a scrap of fear left or even\nof anger--only triumph at the thought of how properly those ruffians had\nbeen sold. \"Like schoolboys they who unaware\"--instead of two women they\nhad found a man with a gun. And the Princess was miles off and forever\nbeyond their reach. When they had settled with him they would no doubt\nburn the House down, but that would serve them little. From his airy\npinnacle he could see the whole sea-front of Huntingtower, a blur in the\ndusk but for the ghostly eyes of its white-shuttered windows.\n\nSomething was coming from it, running lightly over the lawns, lost for\nan instant in the trees, and then appearing clear on the crest of the\nridge where some hours earlier Dougal had lain. With horror he saw that\nit was a girl. She stood with the wind plucking at her skirts and hair,\nand she cried in a high, clear voice which pierced even the confusion of\nthe gale. What she cried he could not tell for it was in a strange\ntongue....\n\nBut it reached the besiegers. There was a sudden silence in the din\nbelow him and then a confusion of shouting. The men seemed to be pouring\nout of the gap which had been the doorway, and as he peered over the\nparapet first one and then another entered his area of vision. The girl\non the ridge, as soon as she saw that she had attracted attention,\nturned and ran back, and after her up the slopes went the pursuit\nbunched like hounds on a good scent.\n\nMr. John Heritage, swearing terribly, started to retrace his steps.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\nTHE SECOND BATTLE OF THE CRUIVES\n\n\nThe military historian must often make shift to write of battles with\nslender data, but he can pad out his deficiencies by learned parallels.\nIf his were the talented pen describing this, the latest action fought\non British soil against a foreign foe, he would no doubt be crippled by\nthe absence of written orders and war diaries. But how eloquently he\nwould discant on the resemblance between Dougal and Gouraud--how the\nplan of leaving the enemy to waste his strength upon a deserted position\nwas that which on the 15th of July, 1918, the French general had used\nwith decisive effect in Champagne! But Dougal had never heard of\nGouraud, and I cannot claim that, like the Happy Warrior, he\n\n              \"through the heat of conflict kept the law\n    In calmness made, and saw what he foresaw.\"\n\nI have had the benefit of discussing the affair with him and his\ncolleagues, but I should offend against historic truth if I represented\nthe main action as anything but a scrimmage--a \"soldiers' battle,\" the\nhistorian would say, a Malplaquet, an Albuera.\n\nJust after half-past three that afternoon the Commander-in-Chief was\nrevealed in a very bad temper. He had intercepted Sir Archie's car,\nand, since L\u00c3\u00a9on was known to be fully occupied, had brought it in by the\nWest Lodge, and hidden it behind a clump of laurels. There he had held a\nhoarse council of war. He had cast an appraising eye over Sime the\nbutler, Carfrae the chauffeur, and McGuffog the gamekeeper, and his\nbrows had lightened when he beheld Sir Archie with an armful of guns and\ntwo big cartridge-magazines. But they had darkened again at the first\nwords of the leader of the reinforcements.\n\n\"Now for the Tower,\" Sir Archie had observed cheerfully. \"We should be a\nmatch for the three watchers, my lad, and it's time that poor devil\nWhat's-his-name was relieved.\"\n\n\"A bonny-like plan that would be,\" said Dougal. \"Man, ye would be\nwalkin' into the very trap they want. In an hour, or maybe two, the rest\nwill turn up from the sea and they'd have ye tight by the neck. Na, na!\nIt's time we're wantin', and the longer they think we're a' in the auld\nTower the better for us. What news o' the polis?\"\n\nHe listened to Sir Archie's report with a gloomy face.\n\n\"Not afore the darkenin'? They'll be ower late--the polis are aye ower\nlate. It looks as if we had the job to do oursels. What's _your_\nnotion?\"\n\n\"God knows,\" said the baronet whose eyes were on Saskia. \"What's yours?\"\n\nThe deference conciliated Dougal. \"There's just the one plan that's\nworth a docken. There's five o' us here, and there's plenty weapons.\nBesides there's five Die-Hards somewhere about, and though they've\nnever tried it afore they can be trusted to loose off a gun. My advice\nis to hide at the Garplefoot and stop the boats landin'. We'd have the\ntinklers on our flank, no doubt, but I'm not muckle feared o' them. It\nwouldn't be easy for the boats to get in wi' this tearin' wind and us\nfirin' volleys from the shore.\"\n\nSir Archie stared at him with admiration. \"You're a hearty young\nfire-eater. But Great Scott! we can't go pottin' at strangers before we\nfind out their business. This is a law-abidin' country, and we're not\nentitled to start shootin' except in self-defence. You can wash that\nplan out, for it ain't feasible.\"\n\nDougal spat cynically. \"For all that it's the right strawtegy. Man, we\nmight sink the lot, and then turn and settle wi' Dobson, and all afore\nthe first polisman showed his neb. It would be a grand performance. But\nI was feared ye wouldn't be for it.... Well, there's just the one other\nthing to do. We must get inside the Hoose and put it in a state of\ndefence. Heritage has McCunn's pistol, and he'll keep them busy for a\nbit. When they've finished wi' him and find the place is empty, they'll\ntry the Hoose and we'll give them a warm reception. That should keep us\ngoin' till the polis arrive, unless they're comin' wi' the blind\ncarrier.\"\n\nSir Archie nodded. \"But why put ourselves in their power at all? They're\nat present barking up the wrong tree. Let them bark up another wrong\n'un. Why shouldn't the House remain empty? I take it we're here to\nprotect the Princess. Well, we'll have done that if they go off\nempty-handed.\"\n\nDougal looked up to the heavens. \"I wish McCunn was here,\" he sighed.\n\"Ay, we've got to protect the Princess, and there's just the one way to\ndo it, and that's to put an end to this crowd o' blagyirds. If they gang\nempty-handed, they'll come again another day, either here or somewhere\nelse, and it won't be long afore they get the lassie. But if we finish\nwith them now she can sit down wi' an easy mind. That's why we've got to\nhang on to them till the polis comes. There's no way out o' this\nbusiness but a battle.\"\n\nHe found an ally. \"Dougal is right,\" said Saskia. \"If I am to have\npeace, by some way or other the fangs of my enemies must be drawn for\never.\"\n\nHe swung round and addressed her formally. \"Mem, I'm askin' ye for the\nlast time. Will ye keep out of this business? Will ye gang back and sit\ndoun aside Mrs. Morran's fire and have your tea and wait till we come\nfor ye? Ye can do no good, and ye're puttin' yourself terrible in the\nenemy's power. If we're beat and ye're no' there, they get very little\nsatisfaction, but if they get _you_ they get what they've come seekin'.\nI tell ye straight--ye're an encumbrance.\"\n\nShe laughed mischievously. \"I can shoot better than you,\" she said.\n\nHe ignored the taunt. \"Will ye listen to sense and fall to the rear?\"\n\n\"I will not,\" she said.\n\n\"Then gang your own gait. I'm ower wise to argy-bargy wi' women. The\nHoose be it!\"\n\nIt was a journey which sorely tried Dougal's temper. The only way in was\nby the verandah, but the door at the west end had been locked, and the\nladder had disappeared. Now of his party three were lame, one lacked an\narm, and one was a girl; besides, there were the guns and cartridges to\ntransport. Moreover, at more than one point before the verandah was\nreached the route was commanded by a point on the ridge near the old\nTower, and that had been Spidel's position when Dougal made his last\nreconnaissance. It behoved to pass these points swiftly and\nunobtrusively, and his company was neither swift nor unobtrusive.\nMcGuffog had a genius for tripping over obstacles, and Sir Archie was\nfor ever proffering his aid to Saskia, who was in a position to give\nrather than to receive, being far the most active of the party. Once\nDougal had to take the gamekeeper's head and force it down, a\nperformance which would have led to an immediate assault but for Sir\nArchie's presence. Nor did the latter escape. \"Will ye stop heedin' the\nlassie, and attend to your own job,\" the Chieftain growled. \"Ye're\nmakin' as much noise as a road-roller.\"\n\nArrived at the foot of the verandah wall there remained the problem of\nthe escalade. Dougal clambered up like a squirrel by the help of cracks\nin the stones, and he could be heard trying the handle of the door into\nthe House. He was absent for about five minutes and then his head peeped\nover the edge accompanied by the hooks of an iron ladder. \"From the\nboiler-house,\" he informed them as they stood clear for the thing to\ndrop. It proved to be little more than half the height of the wall.\n\nSaskia ascended first, and had no difficulty in pulling herself over the\nparapet. Then came the guns and ammunition, and then the one-armed Sime,\nwho turned out to be an athlete. But it was no easy matter getting up\nthe last three. Sir Archie anathematised his frailties. \"Nice old crock\nto go tiger-shootin' with,\" he told the Princess. \"But set me to\nsomething where my confounded leg don't get in the way, and I'm still\npretty useful!\" Dougal, mopping his brow with the rag he called his\nhandkerchief, observed sourly that he objected to going scouting with a\nherd of elephants.\n\nOnce indoors his spirits rose. The party from the Mains had brought\nseveral electric torches and the one lamp was presently found and lit.\n\"We can't count on the polis,\" Dougal announced, \"and when the\nforeigners is finished wi' the Tower they'll come on here. If no', we\nmust make them. What is it the sodgers call it? Forcin' a battle? Now\nsee here! There's the two roads into this place, the back door and the\nverandy, leavin' out the front door which is chained and lockit. They'll\ntry those two roads first and we must get them well barricaded in time.\nBut mind, if there's a good few o' them, it'll be an easy job to batter\nin the front door or the windies, so we maun be ready for that.\"\n\nHe told off a fatigue party--the Princess, Sir Archie and McGuffog--to\nhelp in moving furniture to the several doors. Sime and Carfrae\nattended to the kitchen entrance, while he himself made a tour of the\nground-floor windows. For half an hour the empty house was loud with\nstrange sounds. McGuffog, who was a giant in strength, filled the\npassage at the verandah end with an assortment of furniture ranging from\na grand piano to a vast mahogany sofa, while Saskia and Sir Archie\npillaged the bedrooms and packed up the interstices with mattresses in\nlieu of sandbags. Dougal on his return saw fit to approve their work.\n\n\"That'll fickle the blagyirds. Down at the kitchen door we've got a\nmangle, five wash-tubs and the best part of a ton o' coal. It's the\nwindies I'm anxious about, for they're ower big to fill up. But I've\ngotten tubs o' water below them and a lot o' wire-nettin' I fund in the\ncellar.\"\n\nSir Archie morosely wiped his brow. \"I can't say I ever hated a job\nmore,\" he told Saskia. \"It seems pretty cool to march into somebody\nelse's house and make free with his furniture. I hope to goodness our\nfriends from the sea do turn up, or we'll look pretty foolish. Loudon\nwill have a score against me he won't forget.\"\n\n\"Ye're no' weakenin'?\" asked Dougal fiercely.\n\n\"Not a bit. Only hopin' somebody hasn't made a mighty big mistake.\"\n\n\"Ye needn't be feared for that. Now you listen to your instructions.\nWe're terrible few for such a big place, but we maun make up for\nshortness o' numbers by extra mobility. The gemkeeper will keep the\nwindy that looks on the verandy, and fell any man that gets through.\nYou'll hold the verandy door, and the ither lame man--is't Carfrae ye\ncall him?--will keep the back door. I've telled the one-armed man, who\nhas some kind of a head on him, that he maun keep on the move, watchin'\nto see if they try the front door or any o' the other windies. If they\ndo, he takes his station there. D'ye follow?\"\n\nSir Archie nodded gloomily. \"What is my post?\" Saskia asked.\n\n\"I've appointed ye my Chief of Staff,\" was the answer. \"Ye see we've no\nreserves. If this door's the dangerous bit, it maun be reinforced from\nelsewhere; and that'll want savage thinkin'. Ye'll have to be ay on the\nmove, Mem, and keep me informed. If they break in at two bits, we're\nbeat, and there'll be nothin' for it but to retire to our last position.\nYe ken the room ayont the hall where they keep the coats. That's our\nlast trench, and at the worst we fall back there and stick it out. It\nhas a strong door and a wee windy, so they'll no' be able to get in on\nour rear. We should be able to put up a good defence there, unless they\nfire the place over our heads.... Now, we'd better give out the guns.\"\n\n\"We don't want any shootin' if we can avoid it,\" said Sir Archie, who\nfound his distaste for Dougal growing, though he was under the spell of\nthe one being there who knew precisely his own mind.\n\n\"Just what I was goin' to say. My instructions is, reserve your fire,\nand don't loose off till you have a man up against the end o' your\nbarrel.\"\n\n\"Good Lord, we'll get into a horrible row. The whole thing may be a\nmistake, and we'll be had up for wholesale homicide. No man shall fire\nunless I give the word.\"\n\nThe Commander-in-Chief looked at him darkly. Some bitter retort was on\nhis tongue, but he restrained himself.\n\n\"It appears,\" he said, \"that ye think I'm doin' all this for fun. I'll\nno 'argy wi' ye. There can be just the one general in a battle, but I'll\ngive ye permission to say the word when to fire.... Macgreegor!\" he\nmuttered, a strange expletive only used in moments of deep emotion.\n\"I'll wager ye'll be for sayin' the word afore I'd say it mysel'.\"\n\nHe turned to the Princess. \"I hand over to you, till I am back, for I\nmaun be off and see to the Die-Hards. I wish I could bring them in here,\nbut I daren't lose my communications. I'll likely get in by the\nboiler-house skylight when I come back, but it might be as well to keep\na road open here unless ye're actually attacked.\"\n\nDougal clambered over the mattresses and the grand piano; a flicker of\nwaning daylight appeared for a second as he squeezed through the door,\nand Sir Archie was left staring at the wrathful countenance of McGuffog.\nHe laughed ruefully.\n\n\"I've been in about forty battles, and here's that little devil rather\nworried about my pluck, and talkin' to me like a corps commander to a\nnewly joined second-lieutenant. All the same he's a remarkable child,\nand we'd better behave as if we were in for a real shindy. What do you\nthink, Princess?\"\n\n\"I think we are in for what you call a shindy. I am in command,\nremember. I order you to serve out the guns.\"\n\nThis was done, a shot-gun and a hundred cartridges to each, while\nMcGuffog, who was a marksman, was also given a sporting Mannlicher, and\ntwo other rifles, a .303 and a small-bore Holland, were kept in reserve\nin the hall. Sir Archie, free from Dougal's compelling presence, gave\nthe gamekeeper peremptory orders not to shoot till he was bidden, and\nCarfrae at the kitchen door was warned to the same effect. The shuttered\nhouse, where the only light apart from the garden-room was the feeble\nspark of the electric torches, had the most disastrous effect upon his\nspirits. The gale which roared in the chimney and eddied among the\nrafters of the hall seemed an infernal commotion in a tomb.\n\n\"Let's go upstairs,\" he told Saskia; \"there must be a view from the\nupper windows.\"\n\n\"You can see the top of the old Tower, and part of the sea,\" she said.\n\"I know it well, for it was my only amusement to look at it. On clear\ndays, too, one could see high mountains far in the west.\" His depression\nseemed to have affected her, for she spoke listlessly, unlike the vivid\ncreature who had led the way in.\n\nIn a gaunt west-looking bedroom, the one in which Heritage and Dickson\nhad camped the night before, they opened a fold of the shutters and\nlooked out into a world of grey wrack and driving rain. The Tower roof\nshowed mistily beyond the ridge of down, but its environs were not in\ntheir prospect. The lower regions of the House had been gloomy enough,\nbut this bleak place with its drab outlook struck a chill to Sir\nArchie's soul. He dolefully lit a cigarette.\n\n\"This is a pretty rotten show for you,\" he told her. \"It strikes me as a\nrather unpleasant brand of nightmare.\"\n\n\"I have been living with nightmares for three years,\" she said wearily.\n\nHe cast his eyes round the room. \"I think the Kennedys were mad to build\nthis confounded barrack. I've always disliked it, and old Quentin hadn't\nany use for it either. Cold, cheerless, raw monstrosity! It hasn't been\na very giddy place for you, Princess.\"\n\n\"It has been my prison, when I hoped it would be a sanctuary. But it may\nyet be my salvation.\"\n\n\"I'm sure I hope so. I say, you must be jolly hungry. I don't suppose\nthere's any chance of tea for you.\"\n\nShe shook her head. She was looking fixedly at the Tower, as if she\nexpected something to appear there, and he followed her eyes.\n\n\"Rum old shell, that. Quentin used to keep all kinds of live stock\nthere, and when we were boys it was our castle where we played at bein'\nrobber chiefs. It'll be dashed queer if the real thing should turn up\nthis time. I suppose McCunn's Poet is roostin' there all by his lone.\nCan't say I envy him his job.\"\n\nSuddenly she caught his arm. \"I see a man,\" she whispered. \"There! He is\nbehind those far bushes. There is his head again!\"\n\nIt was clearly a man, but he presently disappeared, for he had come\nround by the south end of the House, past the stables, and had now gone\nover the ridge.\n\n\"The cut of his jib is uncommonly like Loudon, the factor. I thought\nMcCunn had stretched him on a bed of pain. Lord, if this thing should\nturn out a farce, I simply can't face Loudon.... I say, Princess, you\ndon't suppose by any chance that McCunn's a little bit wrong in the\nhead?\"\n\nShe turned her candid eyes on him. \"You are in a very doubting mood.\"\n\n\"My feet are cold and I don't mind admittin' it. Hanged if I know what\nit is, but I don't feel this show a bit real. If it isn't, we're in a\nfair way to make howlin' idiots of ourselves, and get pretty well\nembroiled with the law. It's all right for the red-haired boy, for he\ncan take everything seriously, even play. I could do the same thing\nmyself when I was a kid. I don't mind runnin' some kinds of risk--I've\nhad a few in my time--but this is so infernally outlandish and I--I\ndon't quite believe in it. That is to say, I believe in it right enough\nwhen I look at you or listen to McCunn, but as soon as my eyes are off\nyou I begin to doubt again. I'm gettin' old and I've a stake in the\ncountry, and I daresay I'm gettin' a bit of a prig--anyway I don't want\nto make a jackass of myself. Besides, there's this foul weather and\nthis beastly house to ice my feet.\"\n\nHe broke off with an exclamation, for on the grey cloud-bounded stage in\nwhich the roof of the Tower was the central feature, actors had\nappeared. Dim hurrying shapes showed through the mist, dipping over the\nridge, as if coming from the Garplefoot.\n\nShe seized his arm and he saw that her listlessness was gone. Her eyes\nwere shining.\n\n\"It is they,\" she cried. \"The nightmare is real at last. Do you doubt\nnow?\"\n\nHe could only stare, for these shapes arriving and vanishing like wisps\nof fog still seemed to him phantasmal. The girl held his arm tightly\nclutched, and craned towards the window space. He tried to open the\nframe, and succeeded in smashing the glass. A swirl of wind drove\ninwards and blew a loose lock of Saskia's hair across his brow.\n\n\"I wish Dougal were back,\" he muttered, and then came the crack of a\nshot.\n\nThe pressure on his arm slackened, and a pale face was turned to him.\n\"He is alone--Mr. Heritage. He has no chance. They will kill him like a\ndog.\"\n\n\"They'll never get in,\" he assured her. \"Dougal said the place could\nhold out for hours.\"\n\nAnother shot followed and presently a third. She twined her hands and\nher eyes were wild.\n\n\"We can't leave him to be killed,\" she gasped.\n\n\"It's the only game. We're playin' for time, remember. Besides he won't\nbe killed. Great Scott!\"\n\nAs he spoke, a sudden explosion cleft the drone of the wind and a patch\nof gloom flashed into yellow light.\n\n\"Bomb!\" he cried. \"Lord, I might have thought of that.\"\n\nThe girl had sprung back from the window. \"I cannot bear it. I will not\nsee him murdered in sight of his friends. I am going to show myself, and\nwhen they see me they will leave him.... No, you must stay here.\nPresently they will be round this house. Don't be afraid for me--I am\nvery quick of foot.\"\n\n\"For God's sake, don't! Here, Princess, stop,\" and he clutched at her\nskirt. \"Look here, I'll go.\"\n\n\"You can't. You have been wounded. I am in command, you know. Keep the\ndoor open till I come back.\"\n\nHe hobbled after her, but she easily eluded him. She was smiling now,\nand blew a kiss to him. \"La, la, la,\" she trilled, as she ran down the\nstairs. He heard her voice below, admonishing McGuffog. Then he pulled\nhimself together and went back to the window. He had brought the little\nHolland with him, and he poked its barrel through the hole in the glass.\n\n\"Curse my game leg,\" he said, almost cheerfully, for the situation was\nnow becoming one with which he could cope. \"I ought to be able to hold\nup the pursuit a bit. My aunt! What a girl!\"\n\nWith the rifle cuddled to his shoulder he watched a slim figure come\ninto sight on the lawn, running towards the ridge. He reflected that she\nmust have dropped from the high verandah wall. That reminded him that\nsomething must be done to make the wall climbable for her return, so he\nwent down to McGuffog, and the two squeezed through the barricaded door\nto the verandah. The boiler-house ladder was still in position, but it\ndid not reach half the height, so McGuffog was adjured to stand by to\nhelp, and in the meantime to wait on duty by the wall. Then he hurried\nupstairs to his watch-tower.\n\nThe girl was in sight, almost on the crest of the high ground. There she\nstood for a moment, one hand clutching at her errant hair, the other\nshielding her eyes from the sting of the rain. He heard her cry, as\nHeritage had heard her, but since the wind was blowing towards him the\nsound came louder and fuller. Again she cried, and then stood motionless\nwith her hands above her head. It was only for an instant, for the next\nhe saw she had turned and was racing down the slope, jumping the little\nscrogs of hazel like a deer. On the ridge appeared faces, and then over\nit swept a mob of men.\n\nShe had a start of some fifty yards, and laboured to increase it, having\ndoubtless the verandah wall in mind. Sir Archie, sick with anxiety,\nnevertheless spared time to admire her prowess. \"Gad! she's a miler,\" he\nejaculated. \"She'll do it. I'm hanged if she don't do it.\"\n\nAgainst men in seaman's boots and heavy clothing she had a clear\nadvantage. But two shook themselves loose from the pack and began to\ngain on her. At the main shrubbery they were not thirty yards behind,\nand in her passage through it her skirts must have delayed her, for when\nshe emerged the pursuit had halved the distance. He got the sights of\nthe rifle on the first man, but the lawns sloped up towards the house,\nand to his consternation he found that the girl was in the line of fire.\nMadly he ran to the other window of the room, tore back the shutters,\nshivered the glass, and flung his rifle to his shoulder. The fellow was\nwithin three yards of her, but thank God! he had now a clear field. He\nfired low and just ahead of him, and had the satisfaction to see him\ndrop like a rabbit, shot in the leg. His companion stumbled over him,\nand for a moment the girl was safe.\n\nBut her speed was failing. She passed out of sight on the verandah side\nof the house, and the rest of the pack had gained ominously over the\neasier ground of the lawn. He thought for a moment of trying to stop\nthem by his fire, but realised that if every shot told there would still\nbe enough of them left to make sure of her capture. The only chance was\nat the verandah, and he went downstairs at a pace undreamed of since the\ndays when he had two whole legs.\n\nMcGuffog, Mannlicher in hand, was poking his neck over the wall. The\npursuit had turned the corner and were about twenty yards off; the girl\nwas at the foot of the ladder, breathless, drooping with fatigue. She\ntried to climb, limply and feebly, and very slowly, as if she were too\ngiddy to see clear. Above were two cripples, and at her back the van of\nthe now triumphant pack.\n\nSir Archie, game leg or no, was on the parapet preparing to drop down\nand hold off the pursuit were it only for seconds. But at that moment he\nwas aware that the situation had changed.\n\nAt the foot of the ladder a tall man seemed to have sprung out of the\nground. He caught the girl in his arms, climbed the ladder, and\nMcGuffog's great hands reached down and seized her and swung her into\nsafety. Up the wall, by means of cracks and tufts, was shinning a small\nboy.\n\nThe stranger coolly faced the pursuers and at the sight of him they\nchecked, those behind stumbling against those in front. He was speaking\nto them in a foreign tongue, and to Sir Archie's ear the words were like\nthe crack of a lash. The hesitation was only for a moment, for a voice\namong them cried out, and the whole pack gave tongue shrilly and surged\non again. But that instant of check had given the stranger his chance.\nHe was up the ladder, and, gripping the parapet, found rest for his feet\nin a fissure. Then he bent down, drew up the ladder, handed it to\nMcGuffog and with a mighty heave pulled himself over the top.\n\nHe seemed to hope to defend the verandah, but the door at the west end\nwas being assailed by a contingent of the enemy, and he saw that its\nthin woodwork was yielding.\n\n\"Into the House,\" he cried, as he picked up the ladder and tossed it\nover the wall on the pack surging below. He was only just in time, for\nthe west door yielded. In two steps he had followed McGuffog through the\nchink into the passage, and the concussion of the grand piano pushed\nhard against the verandah door from within coincided with the first\nbattering on the said door from without.\n\nIn the garden-room the feeble lamp showed a strange grouping. Saskia had\nsunk into a chair to get her breath, and seemed too dazed to be aware of\nher surroundings. Dougal was manfully striving to appear at his ease,\nbut his lip was quivering.\n\n\"A near thing that time,\" he observed. \"It was the blame of that man's\nauld motor-bicycle.\"\n\nThe stranger cast sharp eyes around the place and company.\n\n\"An awkward corner, gentlemen,\" he said. \"How many are there of you?\nFour men and a boy? And you have placed guards at all the entrances?\"\n\n\"They have bombs,\" Sir Archie reminded him.\n\n\"No doubt. But I do not think they will use them here--or their guns,\nunless there is no other way. Their purpose is kidnapping, and they hope\nto do it secretly and slip off without leaving a trace. If they\nslaughter us, as they easily can, the cry will be out against them, and\ntheir vessel will be unpleasantly hunted. Half their purpose is already\nspoiled, for it is no longer secret.... They may break us by sheer\nweight, and I fancy the first shooting will be done by us. It's the\nwindows I'm afraid of.\"\n\nSome tone in his quiet voice reached the girl in the wicker chair. She\nlooked up wildly, saw him and with a cry of \"Alesha\" ran to his arms.\nThere she hung, while his hand fondled her hair, like a mother with a\nscared child. Sir Archie, watching the whole thing in some stupefaction,\nthought he had never in his days seen more nobly matched human\ncreatures.\n\n\"It is my friend,\" she cried triumphantly, \"the friend whom I appointed\nto meet me here. Oh, I did well to trust him. Now we need not fear\nanything.\"\n\nAs if in ironical answer came a great crashing at the verandah door, and\nthe twanging of chords cruelly mishandled. The grand piano was suffering\ninternally from the assaults of the boiler-house ladder.\n\n\"Wull I gie them a shot?\" was McGuffog's hoarse inquiry.\n\n\"Action stations,\" Alexis ordered, for the command seemed to have\nshifted to him from Dougal. \"The windows are the danger. The boy will\npatrol the ground floor, and give us warning, and I and this man,\"\npointing to Sime, \"will be ready at the threatened point. And for God's\nsake no shooting, unless I give the word. If we take them on at that\ngame we haven't a chance.\"\n\nHe said something to Saskia in Russian and she smiled assent and went to\nSir Archie's side. \"You and I must keep this door,\" she said.\n\nSir Archie was never very clear afterwards about the events of the next\nhour. The Princess was in the maddest spirits, as if the burden of three\nyears had slipped from her and she was back in her first girlhood. She\nsang as she carried more lumber to the pile--perhaps the song which had\nonce entranced Heritage, but Sir Archie had no ear for music. She\nmocked at the furious blows which rained at the other end, for the door\nhad gone now, and in the windy gap could be seen a blur of dark faces.\nOddly enough, he found his own spirits mounting to meet hers. It was\nreal business at last, the qualms of the civilian had been forgotten,\nand there was rising in him that joy in a scrap which had once made him\none of the most daring airmen on the Western Front. The only thing that\nworried him now was the coyness about shooting. What on earth were his\nrifles and shot-guns for unless to be used? He had seen the enemy from\nthe verandah wall, and a more ruffianly crew he had never dreamed of.\nThey meant the uttermost business, and against such it was surely the\nduty of good citizens to wage whole-hearted war.\n\nThe Princess was humming to herself a nursery rhyme. \"The King of\nSpain's daughter,\" she crooned, \"came to visit me, and all for the\nsake----Oh, that poor piano!\" In her clear voice she cried something in\nRussian, and the wind carried a laugh from the verandah. At the sound of\nit she stopped. \"I had forgotten,\" she said. \"Paul is there. I had\nforgotten.\" After that she was very quiet, but she redoubled her labours\nat the barricade.\n\nTo the man it seemed that the pressure from without was slackening. He\ncalled to McGuffog to ask about the garden-room window, and the reply\nwas reassuring. The gamekeeper was gloomily contemplating Dougal's tubs\nof water and wire-netting, as he might have contemplated a vermin trap.\n\nSir Archie was growing acutely anxious--the anxiety of the defender of a\nstraggling fortress which is vulnerable at a dozen points. It seemed to\nhim that strange noises were coming from the rooms beyond the hall. Did\nthe back door lie that way? And was not there a smell of smoke in the\nair? If they tried fire in such a gale the place would burn like\nmatchwood.\n\nHe left his post and in the hall found Dougal.\n\n\"All quiet,\" the Chieftain reported. \"Far ower quiet. I don't like it.\nThe enemy's no' puttin' out his strength yet. The Russian says a' the\nwest windies are terrible dangerous. Him and the chauffeur's doin' their\nbest, but ye can't block thae muckle glass panes.\"\n\nHe returned to the Princess, and found that the attack had indeed\nlanguished on that particular barricade. The withers of the grand piano\nwere left unwrung, and only a faint scuffling informed him that the\nverandah was not empty. \"They're gathering for an attack elsewhere,\" he\ntold himself. But what if that attack were a feint? He and McGuffog must\nstick to their post, for in his belief the verandah door and the\ngarden-room window were the easiest places where an entry in mass could\nbe forced.\n\nSuddenly Dougal's whistle blew, and with it came a most almighty crash\nsomewhere towards the west side. With a shout of \"Hold tight,\nMcGuffog,\" Sir Archie bolted into the hall, and, led by the sound,\nreached what had once been the ladies' bedroom. A strange sight met his\neyes, for the whole framework of one window seemed to have been thrust\ninward, and in the gap Alexis was swinging a fender. Three of the enemy\nwere in the room--one senseless on the floor, one in the grip of Sime,\nwhose single hand was tightly clenched on his throat, and one engaged\nwith Dougal in a corner. The Die-Hard leader was sore pressed, and to\nhis help Sir Archie went. The fresh assault made the seaman duck his\nhead, and Dougal seized the occasion to smite him hard with something\nwhich caused him to roll over. It was Spidel's life-preserver which he\nhad annexed that afternoon.\n\nAlexis at the window seemed to have for a moment daunted the attack.\n\"Bring that table,\" he cried, and the thing was jammed into the gap.\n\"Now you\"--this to Sime--\"get the man from the back door to hold this\nplace with his gun. There's no attack there. It's about time for\nshooting now, or we'll have them in our rear. What in heaven is that?\"\n\nIt was McGuffog whose great bellow resounded down the corridor. Sir\nArchie turned and shuffled back, to be met by a distressing spectacle.\nThe lamp, burning as peacefully as it might have burned on an old lady's\ntea-table, revealed the window of the garden-room driven bodily inward,\nshutters and all, and now forming an inclined bridge over Dougal's\nineffectual tubs. In front of it stood McGuffog, swinging his gun by the\nbarrel and yelling curses, which, being mainly couched in the\nvernacular, were happily meaningless to Saskia. She herself stood at the\nhall door, plucking at something hidden in her breast. He saw that it\nwas a little ivory-handled pistol.\n\nThe enemy's feint had succeeded, for even as Sir Archie looked three men\nleaped into the room. On the neck of one the butt of McGuffog's gun\ncrashed, but two scrambled to their feet and made for the girl. Sir\nArchie met the first with his fist, a clean drive on the jaw, followed\nby a damaging hook with his left that put him out of action. The other\nhesitated for an instant and was lost, for McGuffog caught him by the\nwaist from behind and sent him through the broken frame to join his\ncomrades without.\n\n\"Up the stairs,\" Dougal was shouting, for the little room beyond the\nhall was clearly impossible. \"Our flank's turned. They're pourin'\nthrough the other windy.\" Out of a corner of his eye Sir Archie caught\nsight of Alexis, with Sime and Carfrae in support, being slowly forced\ntowards them along the corridor. \"Upstairs,\" he shouted. \"Come on,\nMcGuffog. Lead on, Princess.\" He dashed out the lamp, and the place was\nin darkness.\n\nWith this retreat from the forward trench line ended the opening phase\nof the battle. It was achieved in good order, and position was taken up\non the first-floor landing, dominating the main staircase and the\npassage that led to the back stairs. At their back was a short corridor\nending in a window which gave on the north side of the House above the\nverandah, and from which an active man might descend to the verandah\nroof. It had been carefully reconnoitred beforehand by Dougal, and his\nwere the dispositions.\n\nThe odd thing was that the retreating force were in good heart. The\nthree men from the Mains were warming to their work, and McGuffog wore\nan air of genial ferocity. \"Dashed fine position I call this,\" said Sir\nArchie. Only Alexis was silent and preoccupied. \"We are still at their\nmercy,\" he said. \"Pray God your police come soon.\" He forbade shooting\nyet awhile. \"The lady is our strong card,\" he said. \"They won't use\ntheir guns while she is with us, but if it ever comes to shooting they\ncan wipe us out in a couple of minutes. One of you watch that window,\nfor Paul Abreskov is no fool.\"\n\nTheir exhilaration was short-lived. Below in the hall it was black\ndarkness save for a greyness at the entrance of the verandah passage;\nbut the defence was soon aware that the place was thick with men.\nPresently there came a scuffling from Carfrae's post towards the back\nstairs, and a cry as of some one choking. And at the same moment a flare\nwas lit below which brought the whole hall from floor to rafters into\nblinding light.\n\nIt revealed a crowd of figures, some still in the hall and some half-way\nup the stairs, and it revealed, too, more figures at the end of the\nupper landing where Carfrae had been stationed. The shapes were\nmotionless like mannequins in a shop window.\n\n\"They've got us treed all right,\" Sir Archie groaned. \"What the devil\nare they waiting for?\"\n\n\"They wait for their leader,\" said Alexis.\n\nNo one of the party will ever forget the ensuing minutes. After the\nhubbub of the barricades the ominous silence was like icy water,\nchilling and petrifying with an indefinable fear. There was no sound but\nthe wind, but presently mingled with it came odd wild voices.\n\n\"Hear to the whaups,\" McGuffog whispered.\n\nSir Archie, who found the tension unbearable, sought relief in\ncontradiction. \"You're an unscientific brute, McGuffog,\" he told his\nhenchman. \"It's a disgrace that a gamekeeper should be such a rotten\nnaturalist. What would whaups be doin' here at this time of year?\"\n\n\"A' the same, I could swear it's whaups, Sir Erchibald.\"\n\nThen Dougal broke in and his voice was excited. \"It's no whaups. That's\nour patrol signal. Man, there's hope for us yet. I believe it's the\npolis.\"\n\nHis words were unheeded, for the figures below drew apart and a young\nman came through them. His beautifully-shaped dark head was bare, and as\nhe moved he unbuttoned his oilskins and showed the trim dark-blue garb\nof the yachtsman. He walked confidently up the stairs, an odd elegant\nfigure among his heavy companions.\n\n\"Good afternoon, Alexis,\" he said in English. \"I think we may now regard\nthis interesting episode as closed. I take it that you surrender.\nSaskia, dear, you are coming with me on a little journey. Will you tell\nmy men where to find your baggage?\"\n\nThe reply was in Russian. Alexis' voice was as cool as the other's, and\nit seemed to wake him to anger. He replied in a rapid torrent of words,\nand appealed to the men below, who shouted back. The flare was dying\ndown, and shadows again hid most of the hall.\n\nDougal crept up behind Sir Archie. \"Here, I think it's the polis.\nThey're whistlin' outbye, and I hear folk cryin' to each other--no' the\nforeigners.\"\n\nAgain Alexis spoke, and then Saskia joined in. What she said rang sharp\nwith contempt, and her fingers played with her little pistol.\n\nSuddenly before the young man could answer Dobson bustled towards him.\nThe innkeeper was labouring under some strong emotion, for he seemed to\nbe pleading and pointing urgently towards the door.\n\n\"I tell ye it's the polis,\" whispered Dougal. \"They're nickit.\"\n\nThere was a swaying in the crowd and anxious faces. Men surged in,\nwhispered and went out, and a clamour arose which the leader stilled\nwith a fierce gesture.\n\n\"You there,\" he cried, looking up, \"you English. We mean you no ill, but\nI require you to hand over to me the lady and the Russian who is with\nher. I give you a minute by my watch to decide. If you refuse my men are\nbehind you and around you, and you go with me to be punished at my\nleisure.\"\n\n\"I warn you,\" cried Sir Archie. \"We are armed, and will shoot down any\none who dares to lay a hand on us.\"\n\n\"You fool,\" came the answer. \"I can send you all to eternity before you\ntouch a trigger.\"\n\nL\u00c3\u00a9on was by his side now--L\u00c3\u00a9on and Spidel, imploring him to do something\nwhich he angrily refused. Outside there was a new clamour, faces showing\nat the door and then vanishing, and an anxious hum filled the hall....\nDobson appeared again and this time he was a figure of fury.\n\n\"Are ye daft, man?\" he cried. \"I tell ye the polis are closin' round us,\nand there's no' a moment to lose if we would get back to the boats. If\nye'll no' think o' your own neck, I'm thinkin' o' mine. The whole\nthing's a bloody misfire. Come on, lads, if ye're no' besotted on\ndestruction.\"\n\nL\u00c3\u00a9on laid a hand on the leader's arm and was roughly shaken off. Spidel\nfared no better, and the little group on the upper landing saw the two\nshrug their shoulders and make for the door. The hall was emptying fast,\nand the watchers had gone from the back stairs. The young man's voice\nrose to a scream; he commanded, threatened, cursed; but panic was in the\nair and he had lost his mastery.\n\n\"Quick,\" croaked Dougal, \"now's the time for the counter-attack.\"\n\nBut the figure on the stairs held them motionless. They could not see\nhis face, but by instinct they knew that it was distraught with fury and\ndefeat. The flare blazed up again as the flame caught a knot of fresh\npowder, and once more the place was bright with the uncanny light....\nThe hall was empty save for the pale man who was in the act of turning.\n\nHe looked back. \"If I go now, I will return. The world is not wide\nenough to hide you from me, Saskia.\"\n\n\"You will never get her,\" said Alexis.\n\nA sudden devil flamed into his eyes, the devil of some ancestral\nsavagery, which would destroy what is desired but unattainable. He swung\nround, his hand went to his pocket, something clicked, and his arm shot\nout like a baseball pitcher's.\n\nSo intent was the gaze of the others on him, that they did not see a\nsecond figure ascending the stairs. Just as Alexis flung himself before\nthe Princess, the new-comer caught the young man's outstretched arm and\nwrenched something from his hand. The next second he had hurled it into\na far corner where stood the great fireplace. There was a blinding sheet\nof flame, a dull roar, and then billow upon billow of acrid smoke. As it\ncleared they saw that the fine Italian chimneypiece, the pride of the\nbuilder of the House, was a mass of splinters, and that a great hole had\nbeen blown through the wall into what had been the dining-room.... A\nfigure was sitting on the bottom step feeling its bruises. The last\nenemy had gone.\n\nWhen Mr. John Heritage raised his eyes he saw the Princess with a very\npale face in the arms of a tall man whom he had never seen before. If he\nwas surprised at the sight, he did not show it. \"Nasty little bomb\nthat. Time fuse. I remember we struck the brand first in July '18.\"\n\n\"Are they rounded up?\" Sir Archie asked.\n\n\"They've bolted. Whether they'll get away is another matter. I left half\nthe mounted police a minute ago at the top of the West Lodge avenue. The\nother lot went to the Garplefoot to cut off the boats.\"\n\n\"Good Lord, man,\" Sir Archie cried, \"the police have been here for the\nlast ten minutes.\"\n\n\"You're wrong. They came with me.\"\n\n\"Then what on earth----?\" began the astonished baronet. He stopped\nshort, for he suddenly got his answer. Into the hall from the verandah\nlimped a boy. Never was there seen so ruinous a child. He was dripping\nwet, his shirt was all but torn off his back, his bleeding nose was\npoorly staunched by a wisp of handkerchief, his breeches were in\nribbons, and his poor bare legs looked as if they had been\ncomprehensively kicked and scratched. Limpingly he entered, yet with a\nkind of pride, like some small cock-sparrow who has lost most of his\nplumage but has vanquished his adversary.\n\nWith a yell Dougal went down the stairs. The boy saluted him, and they\ngravely shook hands. It was the meeting of Wellington and Bl\u00c3\u00bccher.\n\nThe Chieftain's voice shrilled in triumph, but there was a break in it.\nThe glory was almost too great to be borne.\n\n\"I kenned it,\" he cried. \"It was the Gorbals Die-Hards. There stands the\nman that done it.... Ye'll no' fickle Thomas Yownie.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\nTHE GORBALS DIE-HARDS GO INTO ACTION\n\n\nWe left Mr. McCunn, full of aches but desperately resolute in spirit,\nhobbling by the Auchenlochan road into the village of Dalquharter. His\ngoal was Mrs. Morran's hen-house, which was Thomas Yownie's _poste de\ncommandement_. The rain had come on again, and, though in other weather\nthere would have been a slow twilight, already the shadow of night had\nthe world in its grip. The sea even from the high ground was invisible,\nand all to westward and windward was a ragged screen of dark cloud. It\nwas foul weather for foul deeds.\n\nThomas Yownie was not in the hen-house, but in Mrs. Morran's kitchen,\nand with him were the pug-faced boy known as Old Bill, and the sturdy\nfigure of Peter Paterson. But the floor was held by the hostess. She\nstill wore her big boots, her petticoats were still kilted, and round\nher venerable head in lieu of a bonnet was drawn a tartan shawl.\n\n\"Eh, Dickson, but I'm blithe to see ye. And, puir man, ye've been sair\nmishandled. This is the awfu'est Sabbath day that ever you and me pit\nin. I hope it'll be forgiven us.... Whaur's the young leddy?\"\n\n\"Dougal was saying she was in the House with Sir Archibald and the men\nfrom the Mains.\"\n\n\"Wae's me!\" Mrs. Morran keened. \"And what kind o' place is yon for her?\nThae laddies tell me there's boatfu's o' scoondrels landit at the\nGarplefit. They'll try the auld Tower, but they'll no' wait there when\nthey find it toom, and they'll be inside the Hoose in a jiffy and awa'\nwi' the puir lassie. Sirs, it maunna be. Ye're lippenin' to the polis,\nbut in a' my days I never kenned the polis in time. We maun be up and\ndaein' oorsels. Oh, if I could get a haud o' that red-heided Dougal....\"\n\nAs she spoke, there came on the wind the dull reverberation of an\nexplosion.\n\n\"Keep us, what's that?\" she cried.\n\n\"It's dinnymite,\" said Peter Paterson.\n\n\"That's the end o' the auld Tower,\" observed Thomas Yownie in his quiet\neven voice. \"And it's likely the end o' the man Heritage.\"\n\n\"Lord peety us!\" the old woman wailed. \"And us standin' here like\nstookies and no' liftin' a hand. Awa' wi' ye, laddies, and dae\nsomething. Awa' you too, Dickson, or I'll tak' the road mysel'.\"\n\n\"I've got orders,\" said the Chief of Staff, \"no' to move till the\nsityation's clear. Napoleon's up at the Tower and Jaikie in the\npolicies. I maun wait on their reports.\"\n\nFor a moment Mrs. Morran's attention was distracted by Dickson, who\nsuddenly felt very faint and sat down heavily on a kitchen chair. \"Man,\nye're as white as a dish-clout,\" she exclaimed with compunction. \"Ye're\nfair wore out, and ye'll have had nae meat sin' your breakfast. See, and\nI'll get ye a cup o' tea.\"\n\nShe proved to be in the right, for as soon as Dickson had swallowed some\nmouthfuls of her strong scalding brew the colour came back to his\ncheeks, and he announced that he felt better. \"Ye'll fortify it wi' a\ndram,\" she told him, and produced a black bottle from her cupboard. \"My\nfather aye said that guid whiskey and het tea keepit the doctor's gig\noot o' the close.\"\n\nThe back door opened and Napoleon entered, his thin shanks blue with\ncold. He saluted and made his report in a voice shrill with excitement.\n\n\"The Tower has fallen. They've blown in the big door, and the feck o'\nthem's inside.\"\n\n\"And Mr. Heritage?\" was Dickson's anxious inquiry.\n\n\"When I last saw him he was up at a windy, shootin'. I think he's gotten\non to the roof. I wouldna wonder but the place is on fire.\"\n\n\"Here, this is awful,\" Dickson groaned. \"We can't let Mr. Heritage be\nkilled that way. What strength is the enemy?\"\n\n\"I counted twenty-seven, and there's stragglers comin' up from the\nboats.\"\n\n\"And there's me and you five laddies here, and Dougal and the others\nshut up in the House.\" He stopped in sheer despair. It was a fix from\nwhich the most enlightened business mind showed no escape. Prudence,\ninventiveness were no longer in question; only some desperate course of\nviolence.\n\n\"We must create a diversion,\" he said. \"I'm for the Tower, and you\nladdies must come with me. We'll maybe see a chance. Oh, but I wish I\nhad my wee pistol.\"\n\n\"If ye're gaun there, Dickson, I'm comin' wi' ye,\" Mrs. Morran\nannounced.\n\nHer words revealed to Dickson the preposterousness of the whole\nsituation, and for all his anxiety he laughed. \"Five laddies, a\nmiddle-aged man and an auld wife,\" he cried. \"Dod, it's pretty hopeless.\nIt's like the thing in the Bible about the weak things of the world\ntrying to confound the strong.\"\n\n\"The Bible's whiles richt,\" Mrs. Morran answered drily. \"Come on, for\nthere's no time to lose.\"\n\nThe door opened again to admit the figure of Wee Jaikie. There were no\ntears in his eyes, and his face was very white.\n\n\"They're a' round the Hoose,\" he croaked. \"I was up a tree forenent the\nverandy and seen them. The lassie ran oot and cried on them from the top\no' the brae, and they a' turned and hunted her back. Gosh, but it was a\nnear thing. I seen the Captain sklimmin' the wall, and a muckle man took\nthe lassie and flung her up the ladder. They got inside just in time and\nsteekit the door, and now the whole pack is roarin' round the Hoose\nseekin' a road in. They'll no' be long over the job, neither.\"\n\n\"What about Mr. Heritage?\"\n\n\"They're no' heedin' about him any more. The auld Tower's bleezin'.\"\n\n\"Worse and worse,\" said Dickson. \"If the police don't come in the next\nten minutes, they'll be away with the Princess. They've beaten all\nDougal's plans, and it's a straight fight with odds of six to one. It's\nnot possible.\"\n\nMrs. Morran for the first time seemed to lose hope. \"Eh, the puir\nlassie!\" she wailed, and sinking on a chair covered her face with her\nshawl.\n\n\"Laddies, can you no' think of a plan?\" asked Dickson, his voice flat\nwith despair.\n\nThen Thomas Yownie spoke. So far he had been silent, but under his\ntangled thatch of hair, his mind had been busy. Jaikie's report seemed\nto bring him to a decision.\n\n\"It's gey dark,\" he said, \"and it's gettin' darker.\"\n\nThere was that in his voice which promised something, and Dickson\nlistened.\n\n\"The enemy's mostly foreigners, but Dobson's there and I think he's a\nkind of guide to them. Dobson's feared of the polis, and if we can\nterrify Dobson he'll terrify the rest.\"\n\n\"Ay, but where are the police?\"\n\n\"They're no' here yet, but they're comin'. The fear o' them is aye in\nDobson's mind. If he thinks the polis has arrived, he'll put the wind up\nthe lot.... _We_ maun be the polis.\"\n\nDickson could only stare while the Chief of Staff unfolded his scheme. I\ndo not know to whom the Muse of History will give the credit of the\ntactics of \"infiltration\"--whether to Ludendorff or von Hutier or some\nother proud captain of Germany, or to Foch, who revised and perfected\nthem. But I know that the same notion was at this moment of crisis\nconceived by Thomas Yownie, whom no parents acknowledged, who slept\nusually in a coal cellar, and who had picked up his education among\nGorbals closes and along the wharves of Clyde.\n\n\"It's gettin' dark,\" he said, \"and the enemy are that busy tryin' to\nbreak into the Hoose that they'll no' be thinkin' o' their rear. The\nfive o' us Die-Hards is grand at dodgin' and keepin' out of sight, and\nwhat hinders us to get in among them, so that they'll hear us but never\nsee us? We're used to the ways o' the polis, and can imitate them fine.\nForbye we've all got our whistles, which are the same as a bobbie's\nbirl, and Old Bill and Peter are grand at copyin' a man's voice. Since\nthe Captain is shut up in the Hoose, the command falls to me, and that's\nmy plan.\"\n\nWith a piece of chalk he drew on the kitchen floor a rough sketch of the\nenvirons of Huntingtower. Peter Paterson was to move from the\nshrubberies beyond the verandah, Napoleon from the stables, Old Bill\nfrom the Tower, while Wee Jaikie and Thomas himself were to advance as\nif from the Garplefoot, so that the enemy might fear for his\ncommunications. \"As soon as one o' ye gets into position he's to gie the\npatrol cry, and when each o' ye has heard five cries, he's to advance.\nBegin birlin' and roarin' afore ye get among them, and keep it up till\nye're at the Hoose wall. If they've gotten inside, in ye go after them.\nI trust each Die-Hard to use his judgment, and above all to keep out o'\nsight and no let himsel' be grippit.\"\n\nThe plan, like all great tactics, was simple, and no sooner was it\nexpounded than it was put into action. The Die-Hards faded out of the\nkitchen like fog-wreaths, and Dickson and Mrs. Morran were left looking\nat each other. They did not look long. The bare feet of Wee Jaikie had\nnot crossed the threshold fifty seconds, before they were followed by\nMrs. Morran's out-of-doors boots and Dickson's tackets. Arm in arm the\ntwo hobbled down the back path behind the village which led to the South\nLodge. The gate was unlocked, for the warder was busy elsewhere, and\nthey hastened up the avenue. Far off Dickson thought he saw shapes\nfleeting across the park, which he took to be the shock-troops of his\nown side, and he seemed to hear snatches of song. Jaikie was giving\ntongue, and this was what he sang:\n\n    \"Proley Tarians, arise!\n     Wave the Red Flag to the skies,\n     Heed nae mair the Fat Man's lees,\n       Stap them doun his throat!\n     Nocht to loss except our chains,\n     We maun drain oor dearest veins--\n     A' the worrld shall be our gains----\"\n\nBut he tripped over a rabbit wire and thereafter conserved his breath.\n\nThe wind was so loud that no sound reached them from the House, which\nblank and immense now loomed before them. Dickson's ears were alert for\nthe noise of shots or the dull crash of bombs; hearing nothing, he\nfeared the worst, and hurried Mrs. Morran at a pace which endangered\nher life. He had no fear for himself, arguing that his foes were seeking\nhigher game, and judging, too, that the main battle must be round the\nverandah at the other end. The two passed the shrubbery where the road\nforked, one path running to the back door and one to the stables. They\ntook the latter and presently came out on the downs, with the ravine of\nthe Garple on their left, the stables in front, and on the right the\nhollow of a formal garden running along the west side of the House.\n\nThe gale was so fierce, now that they had no wind-break between them and\nthe ocean, that Mrs. Morran could wrestle with it no longer, and found\nshelter in the lee of a clump of rhododendrons. Darkness had all but\nfallen, and the house was a black shadow against the dusky sky, while a\nconfused greyness marked the sea. The old Tower showed a tooth of\nmasonry; there was no glow from it, so the fire, which Jaikie had\nreported, must have died down. A whaup cried loudly, and very eerily:\nthen another.\n\nThe birds stirred up Mrs. Morran. \"That's the laddies' patrol,\" she\ngasped. \"Count the cries, Dickson.\"\n\nAnother bird wailed, this time very near. Then there was perhaps three\nminutes' silence, till a fainter wheeple came from the direction of the\nTower. \"Four,\" said Dickson, but he waited in vain on the fifth. He had\nnot the acute hearing of the boys, and could not catch the faint echo of\nPeter Paterson's signal beyond the verandah. The next he heard was a\nshrill whistle cutting into the wind, and then others in rapid\nsuccession from different quarters, and something which might have been\nthe hoarse shouting of angry men.\n\nThe Gorbals Die-Hards had gone into action.\n\nDull prose is no medium to tell of that wild adventure. The sober\nsequence of the military historian is out of place in recording deeds\nthat knew not sequence or sobriety. Were I a bard, I would cast this\ntale in excited verse, with a lilt which would catch the speed of the\nreality. I would sing of Napoleon, not unworthy of his great namesake,\nwho penetrated to the very window of the ladies' bedroom, where the\nframework had been driven in and men were pouring through; of how there\nhe made such pandemonium with his whistle that men tumbled back and ran\nabout blindly seeking for guidance; of how in the long run his pugnacity\nmastered him, so that he engaged in combat with an unknown figure and\nthe two rolled into what had once been a fountain. I would hymn Peter\nPaterson, who across tracts of darkness engaged Old Bill in a\nconversation which would have done no discredit to a Gallogate\npoliceman. He pretended to be making reports and seeking orders. \"We've\ngotten three o' the deevils, sir. What'll we dae wi' them?\" he shouted;\nand back would come the reply in a slightly more genteel voice: \"Fall\nthem to the rear. Tamson has charge of the prisoners.\" Or it would be:\n\"They've gotten pistols, sir. What's the orders?\" and the answer would\nbe: \"Stick to your batons. The guns are posted on the knowe, so we\nneedn't hurry.\" And over all the din there would be a perpetual\nwhistling and a yelling of \"Hands up!\"\n\nI would sing, too, of Wee Jaikie, who was having the red-letter hour of\nhis life. His fragile form moved like a lizard in places where no mortal\ncould be expected, and he varied his duties with impish assaults upon\nthe persons of such as came in his way. His whistle blew in a man's ear\none second and the next yards away. Sometimes he was moved to song, and\nunearthly fragments of \"Class-conscious we are\" or \"Proley Tarians,\narise!\" mingled with the din, like the cry of seagulls in a storm. He\nsaw a bright light flare up within the house which warned him not to\nenter, but he got as far as the garden-room, in whose dark corners he\nmade havoc. Indeed he was almost too successful, for he created panic\nwhere he went, and one or two fired blindly at the quarter where he had\nlast been heard. These shots were followed by frenzied prohibitions from\nSpidel and were not repeated. Presently he felt that aimless surge of\nmen that is the prelude to flight, and heard Dobson's great voice\nroaring in the hall. Convinced that the crisis had come, he made his way\noutside, prepared to harass the rear of any retirement. Tears now flowed\ndown his face, and he could not have spoken for sobs, but he had never\nbeen so happy.\n\nBut chiefly would I celebrate Thomas Yownie, for it was he who brought\nfear into the heart of Dobson. He had a voice of singular compass, and\nfrom the verandah he made it echo round the House. The efforts of Old\nBill and Peter Paterson had been skilful indeed, but those of Thomas\nYownie were deadly. To some leader beyond he shouted news: \"Robison's\njust about finished wi' his lot, and then he'll get the boats.\" A\nfurious charge upset him, and for a moment he thought he had been\ndiscovered. But it was only Dobson rushing to L\u00c3\u00a9on, who was leading the\nmen in the doorway. Thomas fled to the far end of the verandah, and\nagain lifted up his voice. \"All foreigners,\" he shouted, \"except the man\nDobson. Ay. Ay. Ye've got Loudon? Well done!\"\n\nIt must have been this last performance which broke Dobson's nerve and\nconvinced him that the one hope lay in a rapid retreat to the\nGarplefoot. There was a tumbling of men in the doorway, a muttering of\nstrange tongues, and the vision of the innkeeper shouting to L\u00c3\u00a9on and\nSpidel. For a second he was seen in the faint reflection that the light\nin the hall cast as far as the verandah, a wild figure urging the\nretreat with a pistol clapped to the head of those who were too confused\nby the hurricane of events to grasp the situation. Some of them dropped\nover the wall, but most huddled like sheep through the door on the west\nside, a jumble of struggling, panic-stricken mortality. Thomas Yownie,\nstaggered at the success of his tactics, yet kept his head and did his\nutmost to confuse the retreat, and the triumphant shouts and whistles of\nthe other Die-Hards showed that they were not unmindful of this final\nduty....\n\nThe verandah was empty, and he was just about to enter the House, when\nthrough the west door came a figure, breathing hard and bent apparently\non the same errand. Thomas prepared for battle, determined that no\nstraggler of the enemy should now wrest from him victory, but, as the\nfigure came into the faint glow at the doorway, he recognised it as\nHeritage. And at the same moment he heard something which made his tense\nnerves relax. Away on the right came sounds, a thud of galloping horses\non grass and the jingle of bridle reins and the voices of men. It was\nthe real thing at last. It is a sad commentary on his career, but now\nfor the first time in his brief existence Thomas Yownie felt charitably\ndisposed towards the police.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Poet, since we left him blaspheming on the roof of the Tower, had\nbeen having a crowded hour of most inglorious life. He had started to\ndescend at a furious pace, and his first misadventure was that he\nstumbled and dropped Dickson's pistol over the parapet. He tried to mark\nwhere it might have fallen in the gloom below, and this lost him\nprecious minutes. When he slithered through the trap into the attic\nroom, where he had tried to hold up the attack, he discovered that it\nwas full of smoke which sought in vain to escape by the narrow window.\nVolumes of it were pouring up the stairs, and when he attempted to\ndescend he found himself choked and blinded. He rushed gasping to the\nwindow, filled his lungs with fresh air, and tried again, but he got no\nfurther than the first turn, from which he could see through the cloud\nred tongues of flame in the ground room. This was solemn indeed, so he\nsought another way out. He got on the roof, for he remembered a\nchimney-stack, cloaked with ivy, which was built straight from the\nground, and he thought he might climb down it.\n\nHe found the chimney and began the descent, confidently, for he had once\nborne a good reputation at the Montanvert and Cortina. At first all went\nwell, for stones stuck out at decent intervals like the rungs of a\nladder, and roots of ivy supplemented their deficiencies. But presently\nhe came to a place where the masonry had crumbled into a cave, and left\na gap some twenty feet high. Below it he could dimly see a thick mass of\nivy which would enable him to cover the further forty feet to the\nground, but at that cave he stuck most finally. All round the lime and\nstone had lapsed into debris, and he could find no safe foothold. Worse\nstill, the block on which he relied proved loose, and only by a\ndangerous traverse did he avert disaster.\n\nThere he hung for a minute or two, with a cold void in his stomach. He\nhad always distrusted the handiwork of man as a place to scramble on,\nand now he was planted in the dark on a decomposing wall, with an\nexcellent chance of breaking his neck, and with the most urgent need for\nhaste. He could see the windows of the House and, since he was sheltered\nfrom the gale, he could hear the faint sound of blows on woodwork. There\nwas clearly the devil to pay there, and yet here he was helplessly\nstuck.... Setting his teeth, he started to ascend again. Better the fire\nthan this cold breakneck emptiness.\n\nIt took him the better part of half an hour to get back, and he passed\nthrough many moments of acute fear. Footholds which had seemed secure\nenough in the descent now proved impossible, and more than once he had\nhis heart in his mouth when a rotten ivy stump or a wedge of stone gave\nin his hands, and dropped dully into the pit of night, leaving him\ncrazily spread-eagled. When at last he reached the top he rolled on his\nback and felt very sick. Then, as he realised his safety, his impatience\nrevived. At all costs he would force his way out though he should be\ngrilled like a herring.\n\nThe smoke was less thick in the attic, and with his handkerchief wet\nwith the rain and bound across his mouth he made a dash for the ground\nroom. It was as hot as a furnace, for everything inflammable in it\nseemed to have caught fire, and the lumber glowed in piles of hot ashes.\nBut the floor and walls were stone, and only the blazing jambs of the\ndoor stood between him and the outer air. He had burned himself\nconsiderably as he stumbled downwards, and the pain drove him to a wild\nleap through the broken arch, where he miscalculated the distance,\ncharred his shins, and brought down a red-hot fragment of the lintel on\nhis head. But the thing was done, and a minute later he was rolling like\na dog in the wet bracken to cool his burns and put out various\nsmouldering patches on his raiment.\n\nThen he started running for the House, but, confused by the darkness, he\nbore too much to the north, and came out in the side avenue from which\nhe and Dickson had reconnoitred on the first evening. He saw on the\nright a glow in the verandah which, as we know, was the reflection of\nthe flare in the hall, and he heard a babble of voices. But he heard\nsomething more, for away on his left was the sound which Thomas Yownie\nwas soon to hear--the trampling of horses. It was the police at last,\nand his task was to guide them at once to the critical point of\naction.... Three minutes later a figure like a scarecrow was admonishing\na bewildered sergeant, while his hands plucked feverishly at a horse's\nbridle.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt is time to return to Dickson in his clump of rhododendrons.\nTragically aware of his impotence he listened to the tumult of the\nDie-Hards, hopeful when it was loud, despairing when there came a\nmoment's lull, while Mrs. Morran like a Greek chorus drew loudly upon\nher store of proverbial philosophy and her memory of Scripture texts.\nTwice he tried to reconnoitre towards the scene of battle, but only\nblundered into sunken plots and pits in the Dutch garden. Finally he\nsquatted beside Mrs. Morran, lit his pipe, and took a firm hold on his\npatience.\n\nIt was not tested for long. Presently he was aware that a change had\ncome over the scene--that the Die-Hards' whistles and shouts were being\ndrowned in another sound, the cries of panicky men. Dobson's bellow was\nwafted to him. \"Auntie Phemie,\" he shouted, \"the innkeeper's getting\nrattled. Dod, I believe they're running.\" For at that moment twenty\npaces on his left the van of the retreat crashed through the creepers on\nthe garden's edge and leaped the wall that separated it from the cliffs\nof the Garplefoot.\n\nThe old woman was on her feet.\n\n\"God be thankit, is't the polis?\"\n\n\"Maybe. Maybe no'. But they're running.\"\n\nAnother bunch of men raced past, and he heard Dobson's voice.\n\n\"I tell you, they're broke. Listen, it's horses. Ay, it's the police,\nbut it was the Die-Hards that did the job.... Here! They mustn't escape.\nHave the police had the sense to send men to the Garplefoot?\"\n\nMrs. Morran, a figure like an ancient prophetess, with her tartan shawl\nlashing in the gale, clutched him by the shoulder.\n\n\"Doun to the waterside and stop them. Ye'll no' be beat by wee laddies!\nOn wi' ye and I'll follow! There's gaun to be a juidgment on evil-doers\nthis nicht.\"\n\nDickson needed no urging. His heart was hot within him, and the\nweariness and stiffness had gone from his limbs. He, too, tumbled over\nthe wall, and made for what he thought was the route by which he had\noriginally ascended from the stream. As he ran he made ridiculous\nefforts to cry like a whaup in the hope of summoning the Die-Hards. One,\nindeed, he found--Napoleon, who had suffered a grievous pounding in the\nfountain and had only escaped by an eel-like agility which had aforetime\nserved him in good stead with the law of his native city. Lucky for\nDickson was the meeting, for he had forgotten the road and would\ncertainly have broken his neck. Led by the Die-Hard he slid forty feet\nover screes and boiler-plates, with the gale plucking at him, found a\npath, lost it, and then tumbled down a raw bank of earth to the flat\nground beside the harbour. During all this performance, he has told me,\nhe had no thought of fear, nor any clear notion what he meant to do. He\njust wanted to be in at the finish of the job.\n\nThrough the narrow entrance the gale blew as through a funnel, and the\nusually placid waters of the harbour were a mass of angry waves. Two\nboats had been launched and were plunging furiously, and on one of them\na lantern dipped and fell. By its light he could see men holding a\nfurther boat by the shore. There was no sign of the police; he reflected\nthat probably they had become tangled in the Garple Dean. The third boat\nwas waiting for some one.\n\nDickson--a new Ajax by the ships--divined who this some one must be and\nrealised his duty. It was the leader, the arch-enemy, the man whose\nescape must at all costs be stopped. Perhaps he had the Princess with\nhim, thus snatching victory from apparent defeat. In any case he must be\ntackled, and a fierce anxiety gripped his heart. \"Aye finish a job,\" he\ntold himself, and peered up into the darkness of the cliffs, wondering\njust how he should set about it, for except in the last few days he had\nnever engaged in combat with a fellow-creature.\n\n\"When he comes, you grip his legs,\" he told Napoleon, \"and get him\ndown. He'll have a pistol, and we're done if he's on his feet.\"\n\nThere was a cry from the boats, a shout of guidance, and the light on\nthe water was waved madly. \"They must have good eyesight,\" thought\nDickson, for he could see nothing. And then suddenly he was aware of\nsteps in front of him, and a shape like a man rising out of the void at\nhis left hand.\n\nIn the darkness Napoleon missed his tackle, and the full shock came on\nDickson. He aimed at what he thought was the enemy's throat, found only\nan arm and was shaken off as a mastiff might shake off a toy terrier. He\nmade another clutch, fell, and in falling caught his opponent's leg so\nthat he brought him down. The man was immensely agile, for he was up in\na second and something hot and bright blew into Dickson's face. The\npistol bullet had passed through the collar of his faithful waterproof,\nslightly singeing his neck. But it served its purpose, for Dickson\npaused, gasping, to consider where he had been hit, and before he could\nresume the chase the last boat had pushed off into deep water.\n\nTo be shot at from close quarters is always irritating, and the novelty\nof the experience increased Dickson's natural wrath. He fumed on the\nshore like a deerhound when the stag has taken to the sea. So hot was\nhis blood that he would have cheerfully assaulted the whole crew had\nthey been within his reach. Napoleon, who had been incapacitated for\nspeed by having his stomach and bare shanks savagely trampled upon,\njoined him, and together they watched the bobbing black specks as they\ncrawled out of the estuary into the grey spindrift which marked the\nharbour mouth.\n\nBut as he looked the wrath died out of Dickson's soul. For he saw that\nthe boats had indeed sailed on a desperate venture, and that a pursuer\nwas on their track more potent than his breathless middle-age. The tide\nwas on the ebb, and the gale was driving the Atlantic breakers\nshoreward, and in the jaws of the entrance the two waters met in an\nunearthly turmoil. Above the noise of the wind came the roar of the\nflooded Garple and the fret of the harbour, and far beyond all the\ncrashing thunder of the conflict at the harbour mouth. Even in the\ndarkness, against the still faintly grey western sky, the spume could be\nseen rising like waterspouts. But it was the ear rather than the eye\nwhich made certain presage of disaster. No boat could face the challenge\nof that loud portal.\n\nAs Dickson struggled against the wind and stared, his heart melted and a\ngreat awe fell upon him. He may have wept; it is certain that he prayed.\n\"Poor souls, poor souls!\" he repeated. \"I doubt the last hour or two has\nbeen a poor preparation for eternity.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe tide next day brought the dead ashore. Among them was a young man,\ndifferent in dress and appearance from the rest--a young man with a\nnoble head and a finely-cut classic face, which was not marred like the\nothers from pounding among the Garple rocks. His dark hair was washed\nback from his brow, and the mouth, which had been hard in life, was now\nrelaxed in the strange innocence of death.\n\nDickson gazed at the body and observed that there was a slight\ndeformation between the shoulders.\n\n\"Poor fellow,\" he said. \"That explains a lot.... As my father used to\nsay, cripples have a right to be cankered.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\nIN WHICH A PRINCESS LEAVES A DARK TOWER AND A PROVISION MERCHANT RETURNS\nTO HIS FAMILY\n\n\nThe three days of storm ended in the night, and with the wild weather\nthere departed from the Cruives something which had weighed on Dickson's\nspirits since he first saw the place. Monday--only a week from the\nmorning when he had conceived his plan of holiday--saw the return of the\nsun and the bland airs of spring. Beyond the blue of the yet restless\nwaters rose dim mountains tipped with snow, like some Mediterranean\nseascape. Nesting birds were busy on the Laver banks and in the\nHuntingtower thickets; the village smoked peacefully to the clear skies;\neven the House looked cheerful if dishevelled. The Garple Dean was a\ngarden of swaying larches, linnets, and wild anemones. Assuredly,\nthought Dickson, there had come a mighty change in the countryside, and\nhe meditated a future discourse to the Literary Society of the Guthrie\nMemorial Kirk on \"Natural Beauty in Relation to the Mind of Man.\"\n\nIt remains for the chronicler to gather up the loose ends of his tale.\nThere was no newspaper story with bold headlines of this the most recent\nassault on the shores of Britain. Alexis Nicolaevitch, once a Prince of\nMuscovy and now Mr. Alexander Nicholson of the rising firm of Sprot and\nNicholson of Melbourne, had interest enough to prevent it. For it was\nclear that if Saskia was to be saved from persecution, her enemies must\ndisappear without trace from the world, and no story be told of the wild\nventure which was their undoing. The constabulary of Carrick and\nScotland Yard were indisposed to ask questions, under a hint from their\nsuperiors, the more so as no serious damage had been done to the persons\nof His Majesty's lieges, and no lives had been lost except by the\nviolence of Nature. The Procurator-Fiscal investigated the case of the\ndrowned men, and reported that so many foreign sailors, names and\norigins unknown, had perished in attempting to return to their ship at\nthe Garplefoot. The Danish brig had vanished into the mist of the\nnorthern seas. But one signal calamity the Procurator-Fiscal had to\nrecord. The body of Loudon the factor was found on the Monday morning\nbelow the cliffs, his neck broken by a fall. In the darkness and\nconfusion he must have tried to escape in that direction, and he had\nchosen an impracticable road or had slipped on the edge. It was returned\nas \"death by misadventure\" and the _Carrick Herald_ and the\n_Auchenlochan Advertiser_ excelled themselves in eulogy. Mr. Loudon,\nthey said, had been widely known in the south-west of Scotland as an\nable and trusted lawyer, an assiduous public servant, and not least as a\ngood sportsman. It was the last trait which had led to his death, for,\nin his enthusiasm for wild nature, he had been studying bird life on the\ncliffs of the Cruives during the storm, and had made that fatal slip\nwhich had deprived the shire of a wise counsellor and the best of good\nfellows.\n\nThe tinklers of the Garplefoot took themselves off, and where they may\nnow be pursuing their devious courses is unknown to the chronicler.\nDobson, too, disappeared, for he was not among the dead from the boats.\nHe knew the neighbourhood and probably made his way to some port from\nwhich he took passage to one or other of those foreign lands which had\nformerly been honoured by his patronage. Nor did all the Russians\nperish. Three were found skulking next morning in the woods, starving\nand ignorant of any tongue but their own, and five more came ashore much\nbattered but alive. Alexis took charge of the eight survivors, and\narranged to pay their passage to one of the British Dominions and to\ngive them a start in a new life. They were broken creatures, with the\ndazed look of lost animals, and four of them had been peasants on\nSaskia's estates. Alexis spoke to them in their own language. \"In my\ngrandfather's time,\" he said, \"you were serfs. Then there came a change,\nand for some time you were free men. Now you have slipped back into\nbeing slaves again--the worst of slaveries, for you have been the serfs\nof fools and scoundrels and the black passion of your own hearts. I give\nyou a chance of becoming free men once more. You have the task before\nyou of working out your own salvation. Go, and God be with you.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBefore we take leave of these companions of a single week I would\npresent them to you again as they appeared on a certain sunny afternoon\nwhen the episode of Huntingtower was on the eve of closing. First we see\nSaskia and Alexis walking on the thymy sward of the cliff-top, looking\nout to the fretted blue of the sea. It is a fitting place for lovers,\nabove all for lovers who have turned the page on a dark preface, and\nhave before them still the long bright volume of life. The girl has her\narm linked with the man's, but as they walk she breaks often away from\nhim, to dart into copses, to gather flowers, or to peer over the brink\nwhere the gulls wheel and oyster-catchers pipe among the shingle. She is\nno more the tragic muse of the past week, but a laughing child again,\nfull of snatches of song, her eyes bright with expectation. They talk of\nthe new world which lies before them, and her voice is happy. Then her\nbrows contract, and, as she flings herself down on a patch of young\nheather, her air is thoughtful.\n\n\"I have been back among fairy tales,\" she says. \"I do not quite\nunderstand, Alesha. Those gallant little boys! They are youth, and youth\nis always full of strangeness. Mr. Heritage! He is youth, too, and\npoetry, perhaps, and a soldier's tradition. I think I know him.... But\nwhat about Dickson? He is the _petit bourgeois_, the _\u00c3\u00a9picier_, the\nclass which the world ridicules. He is unbelievable. The others with\ngood fortune I might find elsewhere--in Russia perhaps. But not\nDickson.\"\n\n\"No,\" is the answer. \"You will not find him in Russia. He is what we\ncall the middle-class, which we who were foolish used to laugh at. But\nhe is the stuff which above all others makes a great people. He will\nendure when aristocracies crack and proletariats crumble. In our own\nland we have never known him, but till we create him our land will not\nbe a nation.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHalf a mile away on the edge of the Laver glen Dickson and Heritage are\ntogether, Dickson placidly smoking on a tree-stump and Heritage walking\nexcitedly about and cutting with his stick at the bracken. Sundry\nbandages and strips of sticking plaster still adorn the Poet, but his\nclothes have been tidied up by Mrs. Morran, and he has recovered\nsomething of his old precision of garb. The eyes of both are fixed on\nthe two figures on the cliff-top. Dickson feels acutely uneasy. It is\nthe first time that he has been alone with Heritage since the arrival of\nAlexis shivered the Poet's dream. He looks to see a tragic grief; to his\namazement he beholds something very like exultation.\n\n\"The trouble about you, Dogson,\" says Heritage, \"is that you're a bit of\nan anarchist. All you false romantics are. You don't see the\nextraordinary beauty of the conventions which time has consecrated. You\nalways want novelty, you know, and the novel is usually the ugly and\nrarely the true. I am for romance, but upon the old, noble classic\nlines.\"\n\nDickson is scarcely listening. His eyes are on the distant lovers and he\nlongs to say something which will gently and graciously express his\nsympathy with his friend.\n\n\"I'm afraid,\" he begins hesitatingly, \"I'm afraid you've had a bad blow,\nMr. Heritage. You're taking it awful well, and I honour you for it.\"\n\nThe Poet flings back his head. \"I am reconciled,\" he says. \"After all\n''tis better to have loved and lost, than never to have loved at all.'\nIt has been a great experience and has shown me my own heart. I love\nher, I shall always love her, but I realise that she was never meant for\nme. Thank God I've been able to serve her--that is all a moth can ask of\na star. I'm a better man for it, Dogson. She will be a glorious memory,\nand Lord! what poetry I shall write! I give her up joyfully, for she has\nfound her true mate. 'Let us not to the marriage of true minds admit\nimpediments!' The thing's too perfect to grieve about.... Look! There is\nromance incarnate.\"\n\nHe points to the figures now silhouetted against the further sea. \"How\ndoes it go, Dogson?\" he cries. \"'And on her lover's arm she leant'--what\nnext? You know the thing.\"\n\nDickson assists and Heritage declaims:\n\n    \"And on her lover's arm she leant,\n       And round her waist she felt it fold,\n     And far across the hills they went\n       In that new world which is the old:\n     Across the hills, and far away\n       Beyond their utmost purple rim,\n     And deep into the dying day\n       The happy princess followed him.\"\n\nHe repeats the last two lines twice and draws a deep breath. \"How\nright!\" he cries. \"How absolutely right! Lord! It's astonishing how that\nold bird Tennyson got the goods!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAfter that Dickson leaves him and wanders among the thickets on the edge\nof the Huntingtower policies above the Laver glen. He feels childishly\nhappy, wonderfully young, and at the same time supernaturally wise.\nSometimes he thinks the past week has been a dream, till he touches the\nsticking-plaster on his brow, and finds that his left thigh is still a\nmass of bruises and that his right leg is wofully stiff. With that the\npast becomes very real again, and he sees the Garple Dean in that stormy\nafternoon, he wrestles again at midnight in the dark House, he stands\nwith quaking heart by the boats to cut off the retreat. He sees it all,\nbut without terror in the recollection, rather with gusto and a modest\npride. \"I've surely had a remarkable time,\" he tells himself, and then\nRomance, the goddess whom he has worshipped so long, marries that\nfurious week with the idyllic. He is supremely content, for he knows\nthat in his humble way he has not been found wanting. Once more for him\nthe Chavender or Chub, and long dreams among summer hills. His mind\nflies to the days ahead of him, when he will go wandering with his pack\nin many green places. Happy days they will be, the prospect with which\nhe has always charmed his mind. Yes, but they will be different from\nwhat he had fancied, for he is another man than the complacent little\nfellow who set out a week ago on his travels. He has now assurance of\nhimself, assurance of his faith. Romance, he sees, is one and\nindivisible....\n\nBelow him by the edge of the stream he sees the encampment of the\nGorbals Die-Hards. He calls and waves a hand, and his signal is\nanswered. It seems to be washing day, for some scanty and tattered\nraiment is drying on the sward. The band is evidently in session, for it\nis sitting in a circle, deep in talk.\n\nAs he looks at the ancient tents, the humble equipment, the ring of\nsmall shockheads, a great tenderness comes over him. The Die-Hards are\nso tiny, so poor, so pitifully handicapped, and yet so bold in their\nmeagreness. Not one of them has had anything that might be called a\nchance. Their few years have been spent in kennels and closes, always\nhungry and hunted, with none to care for them; their childish ears have\nbeen habituated to every coarseness, their small minds filled with the\ndesperate shifts of living.... And yet, what a heavenly spark was in\nthem! He had always thought nobly of the soul; now he wants to get on\nhis knees before the queer greatness of humanity.\n\nA figure disengages itself from the group, and Dougal makes his way up\nthe hill towards him. The Chieftain is not more reputable in garb than\nwhen we first saw him, nor is he more cheerful of countenance. He has\none arm in a sling made out of his neckerchief, and his scraggy little\nthroat rises bare from his voluminous shirt. All that can be said for\nhim is that he is appreciably cleaner. He comes to a standstill and\nsalutes with a special formality.\n\n\"Dougal,\" says Dickson, \"I've been thinking. You're the grandest lot of\nwee laddies I ever heard tell of, and, forbye, you've saved my life.\nNow, I'm getting on in years, though you'll admit that I'm not that dead\nold, and I'm not a poor man, and I haven't chick or child to look after.\nNone of you has ever had a proper chance or been right fed or educated\nor taken care of. I've just the one thing to say to you. From now on\nyou're _my_ bairns, every one of you. You're fine laddies, and I'm going\nto see that you turn into fine men. There's the stuff in you to make\nGenerals and Provosts--ay, and Prime Ministers, and Dod! it'll not be my\nblame if it doesn't get out.\"\n\nDougal listens gravely and again salutes.\n\n\"I've brought ye a message,\" he says. \"We've just had a meetin' and I've\nto report that ye've been unanimously eleckit Chief Die-Hard. We're a'\nhopin' ye'll accept.\"\n\n\"I accept,\" Dickson replies. \"Proudly and gratefully I accept.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe last scene is some days later, in a certain southern suburb of\nGlasgow. Ulysses has come back to Ithaca, and is sitting by his\nfireside, waiting on the return of Penelope from the Neuk Hydropathic.\nThere is a chill in the air, so a fire is burning in the grate, but the\nladen tea-table is bright with the first blooms of lilac. Dickson, in a\nnew suit with a flower in his buttonhole, looks none the worse for his\ntravels, save that there is still sticking-plaster on his deeply\nsunburnt brow. He waits impatiently with his eye on the black marble\ntimepiece, and he fingers something in his pocket.\n\nPresently the sound of wheels is heard, and the peahen voice of Tibby\nannounces the arrival of Penelope. Dickson rushes to the door and at the\nthreshold welcomes his wife with a resounding kiss. He leads her into\nthe parlour and settles her in her own chair.\n\n\"My! but it's nice to be home again!\" she says. \"And everything that\ncomfortable. I've had a fine time, but there's no place like your own\nfireside. You're looking awful well, Dickson. But losh! What have you\nbeen doing to your head?\"\n\n\"Just a small tumble. It's very near mended already. Ay, I've had a\ngrand walking tour, but the weather was a wee bit thrawn. It's nice to\nsee you back again, Mamma. Now that I'm an idle man you and me must take\na lot of jaunts together.\"\n\nShe beams on him as she stays herself with Tibby's scones, and when the\nmeal is ended, Dickson draws from his pocket a slim case. The jewels\nhave been restored to Saskia, but this is one of her own which she has\nbestowed upon Dickson as a parting memento. He opens the case and\nreveals a necklet of emeralds, any one of which is worth half the\nstreet.\n\n\"This is a present for you,\" he says bashfully.\n\nMrs. McCunn's eyes open wide. \"You're far too kind,\" she gasps. \"It\nmust have cost an awful lot of money.\"\n\n\"It didn't cost me that much,\" is the truthful answer.\n\nShe fingers the trinket and then clasps it round her neck, where the\ngreen depths of the stones glow against the black satin of her bodice.\nHer eyes are moist as she looks at him. \"You've been a kind man to me,\"\nshe says, and she kisses him as she has not done since Janet's death.\n\nShe stands up and admires the necklet in the mirror. Romance once more,\nthinks Dickson. That which has graced the slim throats of princesses in\nfar-away Courts now adorns an elderly matron in a semi-detached villa;\nthe jewels of the wild Nausicaa have fallen to the housewife Penelope.\n\nMrs. McCunn preens herself before the glass. \"I call it very genteel,\"\nshe says. \"Real stylish. It might be worn by a queen.\"\n\n\"I wouldn't say but it has,\" says Dickson.\n\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Huntingtower, by John Buchan\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK HUNTINGTOWER ***\n\n***** This file should be named 3782-8.txt or 3782-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/3\/7\/8\/3782\/\n\nProduced by Edward A.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp:\/\/pglaf.org\/fundraising.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":1255,"split":"test"}
