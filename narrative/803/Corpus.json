{"ori_id":"ba8ee38aaf59d57090798dcbe0db6ef416af6533","title":"The Mystery of the Sea","context":"The Mystery of the Sea\n Archibald Hunter, a young Englishman, is passing his leisure time near Cruden Bay in the small Scottish village of Whinnyfold when he has a vision of a couple walking past him, carrying a tiny coffin. Archibald also notices a strange old woman watching him. Later, he finds out that his vision has come true, and a child in town has died. Archibald encounters the bizarre old woman again on the seashore; this woman, who introduces herself as Gormala MacNeil, knows that Archibald saw something out of the ordinary. She proceeds to explain that she has \"Second Sight\"\u2014a sort of psychic ability for premonition that comes and goes at random\u2014and that she can tell that Archibald, too, is a Seer. Fluctuating between skepticism and uneasiness over his newfound abilities, Archibald listens to Gormala's insights and sees one of his visions fulfilled at Lammas-tide, when he and Gormala witness Lauchlane Macleod, a local fisherman, wreck his boat on a chain of sharp rocks known as the Skares. Archibald sees a procession of dead spirits emerge from the water near the Skares and make its way up the cliffs.\nAbout a year later, Archibald has returned to Cruden Bay and is preparing a permanent residence there. He buys a trunk from an auctioneer on the street (where he again encounters Gormala) and finds that the trunk contains letters from the late 16th and early 17th centuries. While near the seashore, Archibald notices two ladies stranded on a rock out in the ocean. He helps them get back to shore, and learns that one of the ladies is an elderly woman named Mrs. Jack, and the other a young, beautiful woman named Marjory, an American who has a strong aversion to Spaniards. Archibald feels himself falling in love with Marjory instantly. Later, Marjory helps Archibald decode the letters that he found in the trunk, which are written in a complicated cipher (Bacon's cipher). Archibald soon proposes marriage to Marjory, but she declines with the excuse that she does not know him well enough.\nEventually, Archibald deciphers all of the documents in the trunk and finds that it is a narrative written by a Spaniard named Don Bernardino de Escoban. Don Bernardino was given a trust by Pope Sixtus V in the late sixteenth century, which included the charge of a substantial treasure to use against England after the defeat of the Spanish Armada. The duty to protect this treasure was to be passed down through generations of Don Bernardino's family, but Don Bernardino lost the treasure after hiding it in a seaside cave. Conveniently, Archibald realizes that, based on the documents, the most likely location of this cave is directly under the house he is currently building.\nLater, when he is in Aberdeen, Archibald encounters a pair of diplomats, and they inform him that the woman he has been spending time with is really Marjory Drake, an heiress from Chicago who used her fortune to buy a battleship for the U.S. Navy to use against the Spanish during the Spanish\u2013American War. There is a Spanish plot against Marjory's life, and the United States government has been trying to protect her, but she fled to Scotland to keep them from interfering with her liberty. Archibald also finds out from Marjory that she is a descendant of Sir Francis Drake, the pirate behind many Elizabethan schemes against the Spanish.\nArchibald wants to help Marjory escape the threat of kidnapping, and the two eventually get married so as to avoid any legal trouble or scandal since Archibald has been coming and going from Castle Crom, Marjory's residence. Archibald soon succeeds in finding the entrance of the treasure cave, and suspects the presence of secret passages on the grounds of Castle Crom.\nOne afternoon, while Marjory and Archibald are at Castle Crom looking at the Spanish documents, the landlord of the castle arrives and interrupts them. This landlord is a Spaniard named Don Bernardino\u2014the descendant of the man who wrote the documents. He is astounded that Archibald has possession of the documents and asks that Archibald return the documents to their proper place and not disturb them again. Archibald and Marjory nonetheless decide to continue looking for the treasure, which they find (with some danger) in the cave under Archibald's house. Don Bernardino and Archibald almost have a duel over this newfound treasure, but decide against it. Meanwhile, Marjory goes missing.\nArchibald decides to ask Don Bernardino for help finding Marjory, and Don Bernardino sees the opportunity of helping to rescue the young woman as a chance to regain the honor he lost in failing to find the treasure. He reveals a secret passage in the castle, and the police determine that Marjory has been kidnapped. Fortunately, Marjory has left a cipher for Archibald, giving him instructions for how to find her. Archibald encounters Gormala during the search and enlists her help, despite the fact that she had previously led the band of kidnappers to Archibald's house, where they stole the treasure. Gormala falls on the cliff, and takes Archibald's hands as she is dying. Through Gormala's power of Second Sight, Archibald sees a vision of the ship and learns of Marjory's location.\nWhile on the ship, Archibald murders two of the kidnappers and releases Marjory. A fight ensues, and Archibald, Marjory, and Don Bernardino are thrown into the water around the Skares. Archibald forces his way to shore, dragging Marjory along with him. Many of the bodies of the other men involved in the struggle are washed up on the shore. Don Bernardino is one of the dead. Marjory and Archibald ensure that his body is taken back to Spain and buried with his ancestors, and they install above his tomb the statue of San Cristobal that guarded over the treasure in the cave.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of The Mystery of the Sea, by Bram Stoker\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

Opposite to me,\nacross the road and standing under the only little clump of trees in the\nplace was a tall, gaunt old woman, who kept looking at me intently. As I\nsat, a little group, consisting of a man and two women, went by. I found\nmy eyes follow them, for it seemed to me after they had passed me that\nthe two women walked together and the man alone in front carrying on his\nshoulder a little black box--a coffin. I shuddered as I thought, but\na moment later I saw all three abreast just as they had been. The old\nwoman was now looking at me with eyes that blazed. She came across the\nroad and said to me without preface:\n\n\"What saw ye then, that yer e'en looked so awed?\" I did not like to\ntell her so I did not answer. Her great eyes were fixed keenly upon me,\nseeming to look me through and through. I felt that I grew quite red,\nwhereupon she said, apparently to herself: \"I thocht so! Even I did not\nsee that which he saw.\"\n\n\"How do you mean?\" I queried. She answered ambiguously: \"Wait! Ye shall\nperhaps know before this hour to-morrow!\"\n\nHer answer interested me and I tried to get her to say more; but she\nwould not. She moved away with a grand stately movement that seemed to\nbecome her great gaunt form.\n\nAfter dinner whilst I was sitting in front of the hotel, there was a\ngreat commotion in the village; much running to and fro of men and women\nwith sad mien. On questioning them I found that a child had been drowned\nin the little harbour below. Just then a woman and a man, the same that\nhad passed the bridge earlier in the day, ran by with wild looks. One of\nthe bystanders looked after them pityingly as he said:\n\n\"Puir souls. It's a sad home-comin' for them the nicht.\"\n\n\"Who are they?\" I asked. The man took off his cap reverently as he\nanswered:\n\n\"The father and mother of the child that was drowned!\" As he spoke I\nlooked round as though some one had called me.\n\nThere stood the gaunt woman with a look of triumph on her face.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe curved shore of Cruden Bay, Aberdeenshire, is backed by a waste of\nsandhills in whose hollows seagrass and moss and wild violets, together\nwith the pretty \"grass of Parnassus\" form a green carpet. The surface of\nthe hills is held together by bent-grass and is eternally shifting as\nthe wind takes the fine sand and drifts it to and fro. All behind is\ngreen, from the meadows that mark the southern edge of the bay to the\nswelling uplands that stretch away and away far in the distance, till\nthe blue mist of the mountains at Braemar sets a kind of barrier. In\nthe centre of the bay the highest point of the land that runs downward\nto the sea looks like a miniature hill known as the Hawklaw; from this\npoint onward to the extreme south, the land runs high with a gentle\ntrend downwards.\n\nCruden sands are wide and firm and the sea runs out a considerable\ndistance. When there is a storm with the wind on shore the whole bay is\na mass of leaping waves and broken water that threatens every instant\nto annihilate the stake-nets which stretch out here and there along the\nshore. More than a few vessels have been lost on these wide stretching\nsands, and it was perhaps the roaring of the shallow seas and the terror\nwhich they inspired which sent the crews to the spirit room and the\nbodies of those of them which came to shore later on, to the churchyard\non the hill.\n\nIf Cruden Bay is to be taken figuratively as a mouth, with the sand\nhills for soft palate, and the green Hawklaw as the tongue, the rocks\nwhich work the extremities are its teeth. To the north the rocks of red\ngranite rise jagged and broken. To the south, a mile and a half away as\nthe crow flies, Nature seems to have manifested its wildest forces. It\nis here, where the little promontory called Whinnyfold juts out, that\nthe two great geological features of the Aberdeen coast meet. The red\nsienite of the north joins the black gneiss of the south. That union\nmust have been originally a wild one; there are evidences of an upheaval\nwhich must have shaken the earth to its centre. Here and there are great\nmasses of either species of rock hurled upwards in every conceivable\nvariety of form, sometimes fused or pressed together so that it is\nimpossible to say exactly where gneiss ends or sienite begins; but\nbroadly speaking here is an irregular line of separation. This line\nruns seawards to the east and its strength is shown in its outcrop. For\nhalf a mile or more the rocks rise through the sea singly or in broken\nmasses ending in a dangerous cluster known as \"The Skares\" and which has\nhad for centuries its full toll of wreck and disaster. Did the sea hold\nits dead where they fell, its floor around the Skares would be whitened\nwith their bones, and new islands could build themselves with the piling\nwreckage. At times one may see here the ocean in her fiercest mood;\nfor it is when the tempest drives from the south-east that the sea is\nfretted amongst the rugged rocks and sends its spume landwards. The\nrocks that at calmer times rise dark from the briny deep are lost to\nsight for moments in the grand onrush of the waves. The seagulls which\nusually whiten them, now flutter around screaming, and the sound of\ntheir shrieks comes in on the gale almost in a continuous note, for the\nsingle cries are merged in the multitudinous roar of sea and air.\n\nThe village, squatted beside the emboucher of the Water of Cruden at the\nnorthern side of the bay is simple enough; a few rows of fishermen's\ncottages, two or three great red-tiled drying-sheds nestled in the\nsand-heap behind the fishers' houses. For the rest of the place as it\nwas when first I saw it, a little lookout beside a tall flagstaff on\nthe northern cliff, a few scattered farms over the inland prospect, one\nlittle hotel down on the western bank of the Water of Cruden with a\nfringe of willows protecting its sunk garden which was always full of\nfruits and flowers.\n\nFrom the most southern part of the beach of Cruden Bay to Whinnyfold\nvillage the distance is but a few hundred yards; first a steep pull up\nthe face of the rock; and then an even way, beside part of which runs\na tiny stream. To the left of this path, going towards Whinnyfold, the\nground rises in a bold slope and then falls again all round, forming a\nsort of wide miniature hill of some eighteen or twenty acres. Of this\nthe southern side is sheer, the black rock dipping into the waters of\nthe little bay of Whinnyfold, in the centre of which is a picturesque\nisland of rock shelving steeply from the water on the northern side, as\nis the tendency of all the gneiss and granite in this part. But to east\nand north there are irregular bays or openings, so that the furthest\npoints of the promontory stretch out like fingers. At the tips of these\nare reefs of sunken rock falling down to deep water and whose existence\ncan only be suspected in bad weather when the rush of the current\nbeneath sends up swirling eddies or curling masses of foam. These little\nbays are mostly curved and are green where falling earth or drifting\nsand have hidden the outmost side of the rocks and given a foothold to\nthe seagrass and clover. Here have been at some time or other great\ncaves, now either fallen in or silted up with sand, or obliterated with\nthe earth brought down in the rush of surface-water in times of long\nrain. In one of these bays, Broad Haven, facing right out to the Skares,\nstands an isolated pillar of rock called locally the \"Puir mon\" through\nwhose base, time and weather have worn a hole through which one may walk\ndryshod.\n\nThrough the masses of rocks that run down to the sea from the sides\nand shores of all these bays are here and there natural channels with\nstraight edges as though cut on purpose for the taking in of the cobbles\nbelonging to the fisher folk of Whinnyfold.\n\nWhen first I saw the place I fell in love with it. Had it been possible\nI should have spent my summer there, in a house of my own, but the want\nof any place in which to live forbade such an opportunity. So I stayed\nin the little hotel, the Kilmarnock Arms.\n\nThe next year I came again, and the next, and the next. And then I\narranged to take a feu at Whinnyfold and to build a house overlooking\nthe Skares for myself. The details of this kept me constantly going to\nWhinnyfold, and my house to be was always in my thoughts.\n\nHitherto my life had been an uneventful one. At school I was, though\nsecretly ambitious, dull as to results. At College I was better off, for\nmy big body and athletic powers gave me a certain position in which I\nhad to overcome my natural shyness. When I was about eight and twenty I\nfound myself nominally a barrister, with no knowledge whatever of the\npractice of law and but little less of the theory, and with a commission\nin the Devil's Own--the irreverent name given to the Inns of Court\nVolunteers. I had few relatives, but a comfortable, though not great,\nfortune; and I had been round the world, dilettante fashion.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nGORMALA\n\n\nAll that night I thought of the dead child and of the peculiar vision\nwhich had come to me. Sleeping or waking it was all the same; my mind\ncould not leave the parents in procession as seen in imagination, or\ntheir distracted mien in reality. Mingled with them was the great-eyed,\naquiline-featured, gaunt old woman who had taken such an interest in\nthe affair, and in my part of it. I asked the landlord if he knew her,\nsince, from his position as postmaster he knew almost everyone for miles\naround. He told me that she was a stranger to the place. Then he added:\n\n\"I can't imagine what brings her here. She has come over from Peterhead\ntwo or three times lately; but she doesn't seem to have anything at\nall to do. She has nothing to sell and she buys nothing. She's not a\ntripper, and she's not a beggar, and she's not a thief, and she's not\na worker of any sort. She's a queer-looking lot anyhow. I fancy from\nher speech that she's from the west; probably from some of the far-out\nislands. I can tell that she has the Gaelic from the way she speaks.\"\n\nLater on in the day, when I was walking on the shore near the Hawklaw,\nshe came up to speak to me. The shore was quite lonely, for in those\ndays it was rare to see anyone on the beach except when the salmon\nfishers drew their nets at the ebbing tide. I was walking towards\nWhinnyfold when she came upon me silently from behind. She must have\nbeen hidden among the bent-grass of the sandhills for had she been\nanywhere in view I must have seen her on that desolate shore. She was\nevidently a most imperious person; she at once addressed me in a tone\nand manner which made me feel as though I were in some way an inferior,\nand in somehow to blame:\n\n\"What for did ye no tell me what ye saw yesterday?\" Instinctively I\nanswered:\n\n\"I don't know why. Perhaps because it seemed so ridiculous.\" Her stern\nfeatures hardened into scorn as she replied:\n\n\"Are Death and the Doom then so redeekulous that they pleasure ye intil\nsilence?\" I somehow felt that this was a little too much and was about\nto make a sharp answer, when suddenly it struck me as a remarkable thing\nthat she knew already. Filled with surprise I straightway asked her:\n\n\"Why, how on earth do you know? I told no one.\" I stopped for I felt all\nat sea; there was some mystery here which I could not fathom. She seemed\nto read my mind like an open book, for she went on looking at me as she\nspoke, searchingly and with an odd smile.\n\n\"Eh! laddie, do ye no ken that ye hae een that can see? Do ye no\nunderstand that ye hae een that can speak? Is it that one with the Gift\no' Second Sight has no an understandin' o' it. Why, yer face when ye saw\nthe mark o' the Doom, was like a printed book to een like mine.\"\n\n\"Do you mean to tell me\" I asked \"that you could tell what I saw, simply\nby looking at my face?\"\n\n\"Na! na! laddie. Not all that, though a Seer am I; but I knew that you\nhad seen the Doom! It's no that varied that there need be any mistake.\nAfter all Death is only one, in whatever way we may speak!\" After a\npause of thought I asked her:\n\n\"If you have the power of Second Sight why did you not see the vision,\nor whatever it was, yourself?\"\n\n\"Eh! laddie\" she answered, shaking her head \"'Tis little ye ken o'\nthe wark o' the Fates! Learn ye then that the Voice speaks only as it\nlisteth into chosen ears, and the Vision comes only to chosen een. None\ncan will to hear or to see, to pleasure themselves.\"\n\n\"Then\" I said, and I felt that there was a measure of triumph in my tone\n\"if to none but the chosen is given to know, how comes it that you, who\nseem not to have been chosen on this occasion at all events, know all\nthe same?\" She answered with a touch of impatience:\n\n\"Do ye ken, young sir, that even mortal een have power to see much, if\nthere be behind them the thocht, an' the knowledge and the experience\nto guide them aright. How, think ye, is it that some can see much, and\nlearn much as they gang; while others go blind as the mowdiwart, at the\nend o' the journey as before it?\"\n\n\"Then perhaps you will tell me how much you saw, and how you saw it?\"\n\n\"Ah! to them that have seen the Doom there needs but sma' guidance to\ntheir thochts. Too lang, an' too often hae I mysen seen the death-sark\nan' the watch-candle an' the dead-hole, not to know when they are seen\ntae ither een. Na, na! laddie, what I kent o' yer seein' was no by the\nGift but only by the use o' my proper een. I kent not the muckle o' what\nye saw. Not whether it was ane or ither o' the garnishins o' the dead;\nbut weel I kent that it was o' death.\"\n\n\"Then,\" I said interrogatively \"Second Sight is altogether a matter of\nchance?\"\n\n\"Chance! chance!\" she repeated with scorn. \"Na! young sir; when the\nVoice has spoken there is no more chance than that the nicht will follow\nthe day.\"\n\n\"You mistake me,\" I said, feeling somewhat superior now that I had\ncaught her in an error, \"I did not for a moment mean that the\nDoom--whatever it is--is not a true forerunner. What I meant was that\nit seems to be a matter of chance in whose ear the Voice--whatever it\nis--speaks; when once it has been ordained that it is to sound in the\near of some one.\" Again she answered with scorn:\n\n\"Na, na! there is no chance o' ocht aboot the Doom. Them that send forth\nthe Voice and the Seein' know well to whom it is sent and why. Can ye no\ncomprehend that it is for no bairn-play that such goes forth. When the\nVoice speaks, it is mainly followed by tears an' woe an' lamentation!\nNae! nor is it only one bit manifestation that stands by its lanes,\nremote and isolate from all ither. Truly 'tis but a pairt o' the great\nscheme o' things; an' be sure that whoso is chosen to see or to hear is\nchosen weel, an' must hae their pairt in what is to be, on to the verra\nend.\"\n\n\"Am I to take it\" I asked, \"that Second Sight is but a little bit of\nsome great purpose which has to be wrought out by means of many kinds;\nand that whoso sees the Vision or hears the Voice is but the blind\nunconscious instrument of Fate?\"\n\n\"Aye! laddie. Weel eneuch the Fates know their wishes an' their wark, no\nto need the help or the thocht of any human--blind or seein', sane or\nsilly, conscious or unconscious.\"\n\nAll through her speaking I had been struck by the old woman's use of the\nword 'Fate,' and more especially when she used it in the plural. It was\nevident that, Christian though she might be--and in the West they are\ngenerally devout observants of the duties of their creed--her belief in\nthis respect came from some of the old pagan mythologies. I should have\nliked to question her on this point; but I feared to shut her lips\nagainst me. Instead I asked her:\n\n\"Tell me, will you, if you don't mind, of some case you have known\nyourself of Second Sight?\"\n\n\"'Tis no for them to brag or boast to whom has been given to see the\nwark o' the hand o' Fate. But sine ye are yerself a Seer an' would\nlearn, then I may speak. I hae seen the sea ruffle wi'oot cause in the\nverra spot where later a boat was to gang doon, I hae heard on a lone\nmoor the hammerin' o' the coffin-wright when one passed me who was soon\nto dee. I hae seen the death-sark fold round the speerit o' a drowned\none, in baith ma sleepin' an' ma wakin' dreams. I hae heard the settin'\ndoom o' the Spaiks, an' I hae seen the Weepers on a' the crood that\nwalked. Aye, an' in mony anither way hae I seen an' heard the Coming o'\nthe Doom.\"\n\n\"But did all the seeings and hearings come true?\" I asked. \"Did it ever\nhappen that you heard queer sounds or saw strange sights and that yet\nnothing came of them? I gather that you do not always know to whom\nsomething is going to happen; but only that death is coming to some\none!\" She was not displeased at my questioning but replied at once:\n\n\"Na doot! but there are times when what is seen or heard has no manifest\nfollowing. But think ye, young sir, how mony a corp, still waited for,\nlies in the depths o' the sea; how mony lie oot on the hillsides, or are\nfallen in deep places where their bones whiten unkent. Nay! more, to how\nmany has Death come in a way that men think the wark o' nature when his\nhastening has come frae the hand of man, untold.\" This was a difficult\nmatter to answer so I changed or rather varied the subject.\n\n\"How long must elapse before the warning comes true?\"\n\n\"Ye know yersel', for but yestreen ye hae seen, how the Death can follow\nhard upon the Doom; but there be times, nay mostly are they so, when\ndays or weeks pass away ere the Doom is fulfilled.\"\n\n\"Is this so?\" I asked \"when you know the person regarding whom the Doom\nis spoken.\" She answered with an air of certainty which somehow carried\nconviction, secretly, with it.\n\n\"Even so! I know one who walks the airth now in all the pride o' his\nstrength. But the Doom has been spoken of him. I saw him with these\nverra een lie prone on rocks, wi' the water rinnin' down from his hair.\nAn' again I heard the minute bells as he went by me on a road where is\nno bell for a score o' miles. Aye, an' yet again I saw him in the kirk\nitsel' wi' corbies flyin' round him, an' mair gatherin' from afar!\"\n\nHere was indeed a case where Second Sight might be tested; so I asked\nher at once, though to do so I had to overcome a strange sort of\nrepugnance:\n\n\"Could this be proved? Would it not be a splendid case to make known; so\nthat if the death happened it would prove beyond all doubt the existence\nof such a thing as Second Sight.\" My suggestion was not well received.\nShe answered with slow scorn:\n\n\"Beyon' all doot! Doot! Wha is there that doots the bein' o' the Doom?\nLearn ye too, young sir, that the Doom an' all thereby is no for\ntraffickin' wi' them that only cares for curiosity and publeecity. The\nVoice and the Vision o' the Seer is no for fine madams and idle gentles\nto while away their time in play-toy make-believe!\" I climbed down at\nonce.\n\n\"Pardon me!\" I said \"I spoke without thinking. I should not have said\nso--to you at any rate.\" She accepted my apology with a sort of regal\ninclination; but the moment after she showed by her words she was after\nall but a woman!\n\n\"I will tell ye; that so in the full time ye may hae no doot yersel'.\nFor ye are a Seer and as Them that has the power hae gien ye the Gift\nit is no for the like o' me to cumber the road o' their doin'. Know ye\nthen, and remember weel, how it was told ye by Gormala MacNiel that\nLauchlane Macleod o' the Outer Isles hae been Called; tho' as yet the\nVoice has no sounded in his ears but only in mine. But ye will see the\ntime----\"\n\nShe stopped suddenly as though some thought had struck her, and then\nwent on impressively:\n\n\"When I saw him lie prone on the rocks there was ane that bent ower him\nthat I kent not in the nicht wha it was, though the licht o' the moon\nwas around him. We shall see! We shall see!\"\n\nWithout a word more she turned and left me. She would not listen to my\ncalling after her; but with long strides passed up the beach and was\nlost among the sandhills.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nAN ANCIENT RUNE\n\n\nOn the next day I rode on my bicycle to Peterhead, and walked on the\npier. It was a bright clear day, and a fresh northern breeze was\nblowing. The fishing boats were ready to start at the turn of the tide;\nand as I came up the first of them began to pass out through the harbour\nmouth. Their movement was beautiful to see; at first slowly, and then\ngetting faster as the sails were hoisted, till at last they swept\nthrough the narrow entrance, scuppers under, righting themselves as they\nswung before the wind in the open sea. Now and again a belated smacksman\ncame hurrying along to catch his boat before she should leave the pier.\n\nThe eastern pier of Peterhead is guarded by a massive wall of granite,\nbuilt in several steps or tiers, which breaks the fury of the gale. When\na northern storm is on, it is a wild spot; the waves dash over it in\nwalls of solid green topped with mountainous masses of foam and spray.\nBut at present, with the July sun beating down, it was a vantage post\nfrom which to see the whole harbour and the sea without. I climbed up\nand sat on the top, looking on admiringly, and lazily smoked in quiet\nenjoyment. Presently I noticed some one very like Gormala come hurrying\nalong the pier, and now and again crouching behind one of the mooring\nposts. I said nothing but kept an eye on her, for I supposed that she\nwas at her usual game of watching some one.\n\nSoon a tall man strode leisurely along, and from every movement of the\nwoman I could see that he was the subject of her watching. He came near\nwhere I sat, and stood there with that calm unconcerned patience which\nis a characteristic of the fisherman.\n\nHe was a fine-looking fellow, well over six feet high, with a tangled\nmass of thick red-yellow hair and curly, bushy beard. He had lustrous,\nfar-seeing golden-brown eyes, and massive, finely-cut features. His\npilot-cloth trousers spangled all over with silver herring scales, were\ntucked into great, bucket-boots. He wore a heavy blue jersey and a cap\nof weazel skin. I had been thinking of the decline of the herring from\nthe action of the trawlers in certain waters, and fancied this would be\na good opportunity to get a local opinion. Before long I strolled over\nand joined this son of the Vikings. He gave it, and it was a decided\none, uncompromisingly against the trawlers and the laws which allowed\nthem to do their nefarious work. He spoke in a sort of old-fashioned,\nbiblical language which was moderate and devoid of epithets, but full\nof apposite illustration. When he had pointed out that certain fishing\ngrounds, formerly most prolific of result to the fishers, were now\nabsolutely worthless he ended his argument:\n\n\"And, sure, good master, it stands to rayson. Suppose you be a farmer,\nand when you have prepared your land and manured it, you sow your seed\nand plough the ridges and make it all safe from wind and devastatin'\nstorm. If, when the green corn be shootin' frae the airth, you take your\nharrow and drag it ath'art the springin' seed, where be then the promise\nof your golden grain?\"\n\nFor a moment or two the beauty of his voice, the deep, resonant,\nearnestness of his tone and the magnificent, simple purity of the man\ntook me away from the scene. He seemed as though I had looked him\nthrough and through, and had found him to be throughout of golden\nworth. Possibly it was the imagery of his own speech and the colour\nwhich his eyes and hair and cap suggested, but he seemed to me for an\ninstant as a small figure projected against a background of rolling\nupland clothed in ripe grain. Round his feet were massed the folds of\na great white sheet whose edges faded into air. In a moment the image\npassed, and he stood before me in his full stature.\n\nI almost gasped, for just behind him, where she had silently come,\nstood Gormala, gazing not at the fisherman but at me, with eyes that\npositively blazed with a sort of baleful eagerness. She was looking\nstraight into my eyes; I knew it when I caught the look of hers.\n\nThe fisherman went on talking. I did not, however, hear what he was\nsaying, for again some mysterious change had come over our surroundings.\nThe blue sea had over it the mystery of the darkness of the night; the\nhigh noon sun had lost its fiery vigour and shone with the pale yellow\nsplendour of a full moon. All around me, before and on either hand, was\na waste of waters; the very air and earth seemed filmed with moving\nwater, and the sound of falling waters was in my ears. Again, the golden\nfisherman was before me for an instant, not as a moving speck but in\nfull size now he lay prone; limp and lifeless, with waxen cold cheeks,\nin the eloquent inaction of death. The white sheet--I could see now that\nit was a shroud--was around him up to his heart. I seemed to feel\nGormala's eyes burning into my brain as I looked. All at once everything\nseemed to resume its proper proportion, and I was listening calmly to\nthe holding forth of the Viking.\n\nI turned instinctively and looked at Gormala. For an instant her eyes\nseemed to blaze triumphantly; then she pulled the little shawl which she\nwore closer round her shoulders and, with a gesture full of modesty and\ndeference turned away. She climbed up the ridges of the harbour wall and\nsat looking across as at the sea beyond, now studded with a myriad of\nbrown sails.\n\nA little later the stolid indifference as to time slipped all at once\nfrom the fisherman. He was instinct with life and action, and with a\ntouch of his cap and a \"Farewell good Master!\" stood poised on the very\nedge of the pier ready to spring on a trim, weather-beaten smack which\ncame rushing along almost grazing the rough stone work. It made our\nhearts jump as he sprang on board and taking the tiller from the hand\nof the steersman turned the boat's head to the open sea. As she rushed\nout through the harbour mouth we heard behind us the voice of an old\nfisherman who had hobbled up to us:\n\n\"He'll do that once too often! Lauchlane Macleod is like all these men\nfrom Uist and the rest of the Out Islanders. They don't care 'naught\nabout naught.'\"\n\nLauchlane Macleod! The very man of whom Gormala had prophesied! The very\nmention of his name seemed to turn me cold.\n\nAfter lunch at the hotel I played golf on the links till evening drew\nnear. Then I got on my bicycle to return home. I had laboured slowly up\nthe long hill to the Stirling quarry when I saw Gormala sitting on the\nroadside on a great boulder of red granite. She was evidently looking\nout for me, for when I came near she rose up and deliberately stood in\nthe roadway in my path. I jumped off my wheel and asked her point blank\nwhat she wanted with me so much that she stopped me on the road.\n\nGormala was naturally an impressive figure, but at present she looked\nweird and almost unearthly. Her tall, gaunt form lit by the afterglow in\na soft mysterious light was projected against the grey of the darkening\nsea, whose sombreness was emphasised by the brilliant emerald green of\nthe sward which fell from where we stood to the jagged cliff-line.\n\nThe loneliness of the spot was profound. From where we stood not a house\nwas to be seen, and the darkening sea was desert of sails. It seemed as\nif we two were the only living things in nature's vast expanse. To me\nit was a little awesome. Gormala's first mysterious greeting when I had\nseen the mourning for the child, and her persistent following of me ever\nsince, had begun to get on my nerves. She had become a sort of enforced\ncondition to me, and whether she was present in the flesh or not, the\nexpectation or the apprehension of her coming--I hardly knew which it\nwas--kept my thoughts perpetually interested in her. Now, her weird,\nstatuesque attitude and the scene around us finished my intellectual\nsubjugation. The weather had changed to an almost inconceivable degree.\nThe bright clear sky of the morning had become darkly mysterious, and\nthe wind had died away to an ominous calm. Nature seemed altogether\nsentient, and willing to speak directly to a man in my own receptive\nmood. The Seer-woman evidently knew this, for she gave fully a minute of\nsilence for the natural charm to work before she spoke. Then in a solemn\nwarning voice she said:\n\n\"Time is flying by us; Lammas-tide is nigh.\" The words impressed me, why\nI know not; for though I had heard of Lammas-tide I had not the smallest\nidea of what was meant by it. Gormala was certainly quick with her\neyes--she had that gypsy quality in remarkable degree--and she seemed to\nread my face like an open book. There was a suppressed impatience in her\nmanner, as of one who must stop in the midst of some important matter to\nexplain to a child whose aid is immediately necessary:\n\n\"Ye no ken why? Is it that ye dinna heed o' Lammas-tide, or that ye no\nken o' the prophecy of the Mystery of the Sea and the treasures that\nlie hid therein.\" I felt more than ever abashed, and that I should have\nknown long ago those things of which the gaunt woman spoke, towering\nabove me as I leaned on my wheel. She went on:\n\n\"An' ye no ken, then listen and learn!\" and she spoke the following rune\nin a strange, staccato cadence which seemed to suit our surroundings\nand to sink into my heart and memory so deep that to forget would be\nimpossible:\n\n    \"To win the Mystery o' the Sea,\n    \"An' learn the secrets that there be,\n    \"Gather in one these weirds three:\n\n    \"A gowden moon on a flowin' tide,\n    \"And Lammas floods for the spell to bide;\n    \"And a gowden mon wi' death for his bride.\"\n\nThere was a long pause of silence between us, and I felt very strangely.\nThe sea before me took odd, indefinite shape. It seemed as though it was\nof crystal clearness, and that from where I gazed I could see all its\nmysteries. That is, I could see so as to know there were mysteries,\nthough what they were individually I could not even dream. The past and\nthe present and the future seemed to be mingled in one wild, chaotic,\nwhirling dream, from the mass of which thoughts and ideas seemed now and\nagain to fly out unexpectedly on all sides as do sparks from hot iron\nunder the hammer. Within my heart grew vague indefinite yearnings,\naspirations, possibilities. There came a sense of power so paramount\nthat instinctively I drew myself up to my full height and became\nconscious of the physical vigour within me. As I did so I looked around\nand seemed to wake from a dream.\n\nNaught around me but the drifting clouds, the silent darkening land and\nthe brooding sea. Gormala was nowhere to be seen.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nLAMMAS FLOODS\n\n\nWhen I got to Cruden it was quite dark. I had lingered by the way\nthinking of Gormala MacNiel and all the queer kind of mystery in which\nshe seemed to be enmeshing me. The more I thought, the more I was\npuzzled; for the strangest thing of all to me was that I understood\npart of what seemed to be a mystery. For instance I was but imperfectly\nacquainted with the Seer-woman's view of what was to be the result of\nher watching of Lauchlane Macleod. I knew of course from her words at\nour first conversation that in him she recognised a man doomed to near\ndeath according to the manifestation of her own power of Second Sight;\nbut I knew what she did not seem to, that this was indeed a golden\nman. From the momentary glimpse which I had had in that queer spell of\ntrance, or whatever it was which had come to me on the pier head, I had\nseemed to _know_ him as a man of gold, sterling throughout. It was not\nmerely that his hair was red gold and that his eyes might fairly be\ncalled golden, but his whole being could only be expressed in that way;\nso that when Gormala spoke, the old rhyme seemed at once a prime factor\nin the group of three powers which had to be united before the fathoming\nof the Mystery of the Sea. I accordingly made up my mind to speak with\nthe Seer-woman and to ask her to explain. My own intellectual attitude\nto the matter interested me. I was not sceptical, I did not believe;\nbut I think my mind hung in poise. Certainly my sympathies tended\ntowards the mysterious side, backed up by some kind of understanding of\nthe inner nature of things which was emotional or unintentional rather\nthan fixed.\n\nAll that night I seemed to dream, my mind working eternally round the\ndata of the day; hundreds of different relationships between Gormala,\nLauchlane Macleod, Lammas-tide, the moon and the secrets of the sea\nrevolved before me. It was grey morning before I fell asleep to the\noccasional chirping of the earliest birds.\n\nAs sometimes happens after a night of uneasy dreaming of some disturbing\ntopic, the reaction of the morning carried oblivion with it. It was well\ninto the afternoon when all at once I remembered the existence of the\nwitch-woman--for as such I was beginning to think of Gormala. The\nthought came accompanied by a sense of oppression which was not of fear,\nbut which was certainly of uneasiness. Was it possible that the woman\nhad in some way, or to some degree, hypnotised me. I remembered with a\nslightly nervous feeling how the evening before I had stopped on the\nroadway obedient to her will, and how I had lost the identity of my\nsurroundings in her presence. A sudden idea struck me; I went to the\nwindow and looked out. For an instant my heart seemed to be still.\n\nJust opposite the house stood Gormala, motionless. I went out at once\nand joined her, and instinctively we turned our steps toward the\nsand-hills. As we walked along I said to her:\n\n\"Where did you disappear to last night?\"\n\n\"About that which is to be done!\" Her lips and her face were set; I\nknew it was no use following up that branch of the subject, so I asked\nagain:\n\n\"What did you mean by those verses which you told me?\" Her answer was\ngiven in a solemn tone:\n\n\"Them that made them alone can tell; until the time shall come!\"\n\n\"Who made them?\"\n\n\"Nane can now tell. They are as aud as the rocky foundations o' the\nisles themselves.\"\n\n\"Then how did you come to know them?\" There was a distinct note of pride\nin her answer. Such a note as might be expected from a prince speaking\nof his ancestry:\n\n\"They hae come doon to me through centuries. Frae mither to dochter, and\nfrom mither to dochter again, wi' never a break in the lang line o' the\ntellin'. Know ye, young master, that I am o' a race o' Seers. I take\nmy name from that Gormala o' Uist who through long years foresaw the\npassing o' mony a one. That Gormala who throughout the islands of the\nwest was known and feared o' all men; that Gormala whose mither's\nmither, and mither's mither again, away back into the darkness o' time\nwhen coracles crept towards the sunset ower the sea and returned not,\nheld the fates o' men and women in their han's and ruled the Mysteries\no' the Sea.\" As it was evident that Gormala must have in her own mind\nsome kind of meaning of the prophecy, or spell, or whatever it was, I\nasked her again:\n\n\"But you must understand something of the meaning, or you would not\nattach so much importance to it?\"\n\n\"I ken naught but what is seen to ma een, and to that inner e'e which\ntelleth tae the soul that which it seeth!\"\n\n\"Then why did you warn me that Lammas-tide was near at hand?\" The grim\nwoman actually smiled as she replied:\n\n\"Did ye no hearken to the words spoken of the Lammas floods, which be of\nthe Powers that rule the Spell?\"\n\n\"Well, the fact is that I don't know anything of 'Lammas-tide!' We do\nnot keep it in the Church of England,\" I added as an afterthought,\nexplanatory of my ignorance. Gormala was clever enough to take advantage\nof having caught me in a weak place; so she took advantage of it to turn\nthe conversation into the way she wished herself:\n\n\"What saw ye, when Lauchlane Macleod grew sma' in yer een, and girt\nagain?\"\n\n\"Simply, that he seemed to be all at once a tiny image of himself, seen\nagainst a waste of ripe corn.\" Then it struck me that I had not as yet\ntold her or any one else of what I had seen. How then did she know it? I\nwas annoyed and asked her. She answered scornfully:\n\n\"How kent I it, an' me a Seer o' a race o' Seers! Are ma wakin' een then\nso dim or so sma' that I canna read the thochts o' men in the glances o'\ntheir een. Did I no see yer een look near an' far as quick as thocht?\nBut what saw ye after, when ye looked rapt and yer een peered side to\nside, as though at one lyin' prone?\" I was more annoyed than ever and\nanswered her in a sort of stupor:\n\n\"I saw him lying dead on a rock, with a swift tide running by; and over\nthe waters the broken track of a golden moon.\" She made a sound which\nwas almost a cry, and which recalled me to myself as I looked at her.\nShe was ablaze. She towered to her full height with an imperious,\nexultant mien; the light in her eyes was more than human as she said:\n\n\"Dead, as I masel' saw him an' 'mid the foam o' the tide race! An' gowd,\nalways gowd ahint him in the een of this greater Seer. Gowden corn, and\ngowden moon, and gowden sea! Aye! an' I see it now, backie-bird that I\nhae been; the gowden mon indeed, wi' his gowden een an' his gowden hair\nand all the truth o' his gowden life!\" Then turning to me she said\nfiercely:\n\n\"Why did I warn ye that Lammas-tide was near? Go ask those that value\nthe months and days thereof, when be Lammas and what it means to them\nthat hae faith. See what they are; learn o' the comin' o' the moon and\no' the flowin' o' the tides that follow!\"\n\nWithout another word she turned and left me.\n\nI went back to the hotel at once, determined to post myself as to\nLammas-tide; its facts and constitutions, and the beliefs and traditions\nthat hung around it. Also to learn the hours of the tides, and the age\nof the moon about the time of Lammas-tide. Doubtless I could have found\nout all I wanted from some of the ministers of the various houses of\nreligion which hold in Cruden; but I was not wishful to make public,\neven so far, the mystery which was closing around me. My feeling was\npartly a saving sense of humour, or the fear of ridicule, and partly a\ngenuine repugnance to enter upon the subject with any one who might not\ntake it as seriously as I could wish. From which latter I gather that\nthe whole affair was becoming woven into the structure of my life.\n\nPossibly it was, that some trait, or tendency, or power which was\nindividual to me was beginning to manifest itself and to find its means\nof expression. In my secret heart I not only believed but knew that some\ninstinct within me was guiding my thoughts in some strange way. The\nsense of occult power which is so vital a part of divination was growing\nwithin me and asserting its masterdom, and with it came an equally\nforceful desire of secrecy. The Seer in me, latent so long, was becoming\nconscious of his strength, and jealous of it.\n\nAt this time, as the feeling of strength and consciousness grew, it\nseemed to lose something of its power from this very cause. Gradually it\nwas forced upon me that for the full manifestation of such faculty as\nI might possess, some kind of abstraction or surrender of self was\nnecessary. Even a few hours of experience had taught me much; for now\nthat my mind was bent on the phenomena of Second Sight the whole living\nand moving world around me became a veritable diorama of possibilities.\nWithin two days from the episode at the Pier head I had had behind me a\nlarger experience of effort of occult force than generally comes to a\nman in a lifetime. When I look back, it seems to me that all the forces\nof life and nature became exposed to my view. A thousand things which\nhitherto I had accepted in simple faith as facts, were pregnant with\nnew meanings. I began to understand that the whole earth and sea,\nand air--all that of which human beings generally ordinarily take\ncognisance, is but a film or crust which hides the deeper moving powers\nor forces. With this insight I began to understand the grand guesses of\nthe Pantheists, pagan and christian alike, who out of their spiritual\nand nervous and intellectual sensitiveness began to realise that there\nwas somewhere a purposeful cause of universal action. An action which in\nits special or concrete working appeared like the sentience of nature in\ngeneral, and of the myriad items of its cosmogony.\n\nI soon learned that Lammas day is the first of August and is so often\naccompanied by heavy weather that Lammas floods are almost annually\nrecurrent. The eve of the day is more or less connected with various\nsuperstitions.\n\nThis made me more eager for further information, and by the aid of a\nchance friend, I unearthed at Aberdeen a learned professor who gave me\noffhand all the information which I desired. In fact he was so full of\nastronomical learning that I had to stop him now and again in order to\nelucidate some point easily explainable to those who understood his\nterminology, but which wrapped my swaddling knowledge in a mystery all\nits own. I have a sneaking friendliness even now for anyone to whom the\nword 'syzygy' carries no special meaning.\n\nI got at the bases of facts, however, and understood that on the night\nof July 31, which was the eve of Lammas-tide, the moon would be full at\nmidnight. I learned also that from certain astronomical reasons the tide\nwhich would ostensibly begin its flow a little after midnight would in\nreality commence just on the stroke. As these were the points which\nconcerned me I came away with a new feeling of awe upon me. It seemed\nas though the heavens as well as the earth were bending towards the\nrealisation or fulfillment of the old prophecy. At this time my own\nconnection with the mystery, or how it might affect me personally, did\nnot even enter my head. I was content to be an obedient item in the\ngeneral scheme of things.\n\nIt was now the 28th July so, if it were to take place at the Lammas-tide\nof the current year, we should know soon the full measure of the\ndenou\u00c3\u00aament. There was but one thing wanting to complete the conditions\nof the prophecy. The weather had been abnormally dry, and there might\nafter all be no Lammas floods. To-day, however, the sky had been heavily\novercast. Great black clouds which seemed to roll along tumbling over\nand over, as the sail of a foundered boat does in a current, loomed up\nfrom the west. The air grew closer, and to breathe was an effort. A sort\nof shiver came over the wide stretch of open country. Darker and darker\ngrew the sky, till it seemed so like night that the birds in the few\nlow-lying coppices and the scanty hedgerows ceased to sing. The bleat of\nsheep and the low of cattle seemed to boom through the still air with a\nhollow sound, as if coming from a distance. The intolerable stillness\nwhich precedes the storm became so oppressive that I, who am abnormally\nsusceptible to the moods of nature, could almost have screamed out.\n\nThen all at once the storm broke. There was a flash of lightning so\nvivid that it lit up the whole country away to the mountains which\nencircle Braemar. The fierce crash and wide roll of the thunder followed\nwith incredible quickness. And then the hot, heavy-dropped summer rain\nfell in torrents.\n\nAll that afternoon the rain fell, with only a few brief intervals of\nglowing sunshine. All night, too, it seemed to fall without ceasing,\nfor whenever I woke--which I did frequently with a sense over me of\nsomething impending--I could hear the quick, heavy patter on the roof,\nand the rush and gurgle of the overcharged gutters.\n\nThe next day was one of unmitigated gloom. The rain poured down\nceaselessly. There was little wind, just sufficient to roll\nnorth-eastwards the great masses of rain-laden clouds piled up by the\nGulf Stream against the rugged mountains of the western coast and its\nrocky islands. Two whole days there were of such rain, and then there\nwas no doubt as to the strength of the Lammas floods this year. All the\nwide uplands of Buchan were glistening with runnels of water whenever\nthe occasional glimpses of sunshine struck them. Both the Water of\nCruden and the Back Burn were running bank high. On all sides it was\nreported that the Lammas floods were the greatest that had been known in\nmemory.\n\nAll this time my own spiritual and intellectual uneasiness was\nperpetually growing. The data for the working of the prophecy were all\nfixed with remarkable exactness. In theatrical parlance 'the stage was\nset' and all ready for the action which was to come. As the hours wore\non, my uneasiness changed somewhat and apprehension became merged in a\ncurious mixture of superstition and exaltation. I was growing eager to\nthe coming time.\n\nThe afternoon of July 31 was fine. The sun shone brightly; the air was\ndry and, for the time of year, cool. It seemed as though the spell of\nwet weather was over and that fiery August was coming to its own again.\nThe effects of the rainstorm were, however, manifest. Not only was every\nrill and stream and river in the North in spate but the bogs of the\nmountains were so saturated with wet that many days must elapse before\nthey could cease to send their quota to swell the streams. The mountain\nvalleys were generally lakes in miniature. As one went through the\ncountry the murmur or rush of falling water was forever in the ears. I\nsuppose it was in my own case partly because I was concerned in the mere\nexistence of Lammas floods that the whole of nature seemed so insistent\non the subject. The sound of moving water in its myriad gamut was so\nperpetually in my ears that I could never get my mind away from it. I\nhad a long walk that afternoon through roads still too wet and heavy for\nbicycling. I came back to dinner thoroughly tired out, and went to bed\nearly.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nTHE MYSTERY OF THE SEA\n\n\nI do not remember what woke me. I have a vague idea that it was a voice,\nbut whether outside the house or within myself I know not.\n\nIt was eleven o'clock by my watch when I left the Kilmarnock Arms and\ntook my way across the sandhills, heading for the Hawklaw which stood\nout boldly in the brilliant moonlight. I followed the devious sheep\ntrack amongst the dunes covered with wet bent-grass, every now and again\nstumbling amongst the rabbit burrows which in those days honeycombed the\nsandhills of Cruden Bay. At last I came to the Hawklaw, and, climbing\nthe steep terraced edge near the sea, sat on the top to breathe myself\nafter the climb.\n\nThe scene was one of exquisite beauty. Its natural loveliness was\nenhanced by the softness of the full yellow moonlight which seemed to\nflood the heavens and the earth alike. To the south-east the bleak\npromontory of Whinnyfold stood out stark and black as velvet and the\nrocks of the Skares were like black dots in the quivering sea of gold. I\narose and went on my way. The tide was far out and as I stumbled along\nthe rude path above the waste of boulders I had a feeling that I should\nbe late. I hurried on, crossed the little rill which usually only\ntrickled down beside the fishers' zigzag path at the back of Whinnyfold\nbut which was now a rushing stream--again the noise of falling water,\nthe voice of the Lammas floods--and took the cart track which ran hard\nby the cliff down to the point which looked direct upon the Skares.\n\nWhen I reached the very edge of the cliff, where the long sea-grass\nand the deep clover felt underfoot like a luxurious carpet, I was not\nsurprised to see Gormala seated, looking out seawards. The broad track\nof the moon lay right across the outmost rock of the Skares and falling\nacross some of the jagged rocks, which seemed like fangs rising from\nthe deep water as the heave of the waveless sea fell back and the white\nwater streamed down, came up to where we stood and seemed to bathe both\nthe Seer-woman and myself in light. There was no current anywhere, but\nonly the silent rise and fall of the water in the everlasting movement\nof the sea. When she heard me behind her Gormala turned round, and the\npatient calmness of her face disappeared. She rose quickly, and as she\ndid so pointed to a small boat which sailing up from the south was now\ndrawing opposite to us and appeared to be making a course as close to\nshore as possible, just clearing the outer bulwark of the Skares.\n\n\"Look!\" she said, \"Lauchlane Macleod comes by his lanes. The rocks are\naround him, and his doom is at hand!\"\n\nThere did not appear any danger in such a course; the wind was gentle,\nthe tide was at the still moment between ebb and flow, and the\nsmoothness of the water beyond the rock seemed to mark its great depth.\n\nAll at once the boat seemed to stand still,--we were too far off to hear\na sound even on such a still night. The mast bent forward and broke\nshort off, the sails hung limp in the water with the peak of the lug\nsail sticking up in a great triangle, like the fin of a mammoth shark. A\nfew seconds after, a dark speck moved on the water which became agitated\naround it; it was evident that a swimmer was making for the land. I\nwould have gone to help him had it been of use; but it was not, the\nouter rock was half a mile away. Indeed, though I knew it was no use,\nI was yet about to swim to meet him when Gormala's voice behind me\narrested me:\n\n\"Do ye no see that gin ye meet him amid yon rocks, ye can, when the tide\nbegins to race, be no help to any. If he can win through, ye may help\nhim if ye bide here.\" The advice was good and I stayed my feet. The\nswimmer evidently knew the danger, for he hurried frantically to win\nsome point of safety before the tide should turn. But the rocks of the\nSkares are deadly steep; they rise from the water sheer everywhere,\nand to climb them from the sea is a hopeless task. Once and again the\nswimmer tried to find a chink or cranny where he could climb; but each\ntime he tried to raise himself he fell back into the water. Moreover I\ncould see that he was wounded, for his left hand hung idle. He seemed to\nrealise the hopelessness of the task, and turning, made desperately for\nthe part where we stood. He was now within the most dangerous spot in\nthe whole region of the Skares. The water is of great depth everywhere\nand the needlepoints of rocks rise almost to the very surface. It is\nonly when the waves are rough at low water that they can be seen at all,\nwhen the dip of the waves leaves them bare; but from the surface in\ncalm weather they cannot be seen as the swirl of the tide around them\nis invisible. Here, too, the tide, rounding the point and having the\ncurrent broken by the masses of the great rock, rolls with inconceivable\nrapidity. I had too often watched from the headland where my home was to\nbe the set of the tide not to know the danger. I shouted as loudly as I\ncould, but for some reason he did not hear me. The moments ere the tide\nshould turn seemed like ages; and yet it was with a sudden shock that I\nheard the gurgle of moving water followed by the lap, lap, lap, getting\nquicker each second. Somewhere inland a clock struck twelve.\n\nThe tide had turned and was beginning to flow.\n\nIn a few seconds the swimmer felt its effects, though he did not seem to\nnotice them. Then he was swept towards the north. All at once there was\na muffled cry which seemed to reach slowly to where we stood, and the\nswimmer rolled over for an instant. It was only too apparent what had\nhappened; he had struck his arm against one of the sunken rocks and\ninjured it. Then he commenced a mad struggle for life, swimming without\neither arm in that deadly current which grew faster and faster every\nmoment. He was breathless, and now and again his head dipped; but he\nkept on valiantly. At last in one of these dips, borne by the momentum\nof his own strength and the force of the current, he struck his head\nagainst another of the sunken rocks. For an instant he raised it, and I\ncould see it run red in the glare of the moonlight.\n\nThen he sank; from the height where I stood I could see the body roll\nover and over in the fierce current which made for the outmost point to\nthe north-east of the promontory. I ran over as fast as I could, Gormala\nfollowing. When I came to the rock, which here shelved, I plunged in and\nafter a few strokes met by chance the body as it rolled upward. With a\ndesperate effort I brought it to land.\n\nThe struggle to lift the body from the water and to bear it up the rock\nexhausted me, so that when I reached the top of the cliff I had to pause\nfor a few seconds to breathe hard. Since the poor fellow's struggle for\nlife had begun I had never for an instant given the prophecy a thought.\nBut now, all at once, as I looked past the figure, lying limp before me\nwith the poor arms twisted unnaturally and the head turned--away past\nthe moonlit sea and the great, golden orb whose track was wrinkled over\nthe racing tide, the full force of it burst upon me, and I felt a sort\nof spiritual transformation. The air seemed full of fluttering wings;\nsea and land alike teemed with life that I had not hitherto dreamed\nof. I fell in a sort of spiritual trance. But the open eyes were upon\nme; I feared the man was dead, but Briton-like I would not accept\nthe conviction without effort. So I raised the body to my shoulders,\ndetermined to make with what speed I could for Whinnyfold where fire and\nwilling hands could aid in restoration. As I laid the limp body across\nmy shoulders, holding the two hands in my right hand to steady the\nburden whilst with the left I drew some of the clothing tight, I caught\nGormala's eye. She had not helped me in any possible way, though more\nthan once in distress I had called to her. So now I said angrily:\n\n\"Get away woman! You should be ashamed of yourself never to help at\nsuch a time,\" and I took my way unaided. I did not heed at the time\nher answer, spoken with a certain measure of deprecation, though it\nafterwards came back to me:\n\n\"Am I to wark against the Fates when They have spoken! The Dead are dead\nindeed when the Voice has whispered in their ears!\"\n\nNow, as I passed along with the hands of the dead man in mine--the true\nshell of a man whose spirit could be but little space away whilst the\nstill blood in the veins was yet warm--a strange thing began to happen.\nThe spirits of earth and sea and air seemed to take shape to me, and all\nthe myriad sounds of the night to have a sentient cause of utterance. As\nI panted and struggled on, my physical effort warring equally with the\nnew spiritual experience so that nothing remained except sentience and\nmemory, I could see Gormala walking abreast me with even steps. Her eyes\nglared balefully with a fierce disappointment; never once did she remit\nthe vigilant, keen look which seemed to pierce into my very soul.\n\nFor a short space of time there was something of antagonism to her; but\nthis died away imperceptibly, and I neither cared nor thought about her,\nexcept when my attention would be called to her. I was becoming wrapped\nin the realisation of the mightier forces around me.\n\nJust where the laneway from the cliff joins Whinnyfold there is a steep\nzigzag path running down to the stony beach far below where the fishers\nkeep their boats and which is protected from almost the wildest seas by\nthe great black rock--the Caudman,--which fills the middle of the little\nbay, leaving deep channels on either hand. When I was come to this spot,\nsuddenly all the sounds of the night seemed to cease. The very air grew\nstill so that the grasses did not move or rustle, and the waters of the\nswirling tide ceased to run in grim silence on their course. Even to\nthat inner sense, which was so new to me that the change in everything\nto which it was susceptible became at once noticeable, all things stood\nstill. It was as though the spirits of earth and air and water were\nholding their breath for some rare portent. Indeed I noticed as my eye\nranged the surface of the sea, that the moon track was for the time no\nlonger rippled, but lay in a broad glistening band.\n\nThe only living thing in all the wide world was, it seemed to me, the\nfigure of Gormala as, with lowering eyes and suspended breath, she stood\nwatching me with uncompromising, persistent sternness.\n\nThen my own heart seemed to stand still, to be a part of the grim\nsilence of the waiting forces of the world. I was not frightened; I was\nnot even amazed. All seemed so thoroughly in keeping with the prevailing\ninfluence of the time that I did not feel even a moment of surprise.\n\nUp the steep path came a silent procession of ghostly figures, so misty\nof outline that through the grey green of their phantom being the rocks\nand moonlit sea were apparent, and even the velvet blackness of the\nshadows of the rocks did not lose their gloom. And yet each figure was\ndefined so accurately that every feature, every particle of dress or\naccoutrement could be discerned. Even the sparkle of their eyes in that\ngrim waste of ghostly grey was like the lambent flashes of phosphoric\nlight in the foam of moving water cleft by a swift prow. There was no\nneed for me to judge by the historical sequence of their attire, or by\nany inference of hearing; I knew in my heart that these were the ghosts\nof the dead who had been drowned in the waters of the Cruden Skares.\n\nIndeed the moments of their passing--and they were many for the line was\nof sickening length--became to me a lesson of the long flight of time.\nAt the first were skin-clad savages with long, wild hair matted; then\nothers with rude, primitive clothing. And so on in historic order men,\naye, and here and there a woman, too, of many lands, whose garments were\nof varied cut and substance. Red-haired Vikings and black-haired Celts\nand Phoenicians, fair-haired Saxons and swarthy Moors in flowing robes.\nAt first the figures, chiefly of the barbarians, were not many; but as\nthe sad procession passed along I could see how each later year had\nbrought its ever-growing tale of loss and disaster, and added more and\nfaster to the grim harvest of the sea. A vast number of the phantoms had\npassed when there came along a great group which at once attracted my\nattention. They were all swarthy, and bore themselves proudly under\ntheir cuirasses and coats of mail, or their garb as fighting men of\nthe sea. Spaniards they were, I knew from their dress, and of three\ncenturies back. For an instant my heart leapt; these were men of the\ngreat Armada, come up from the wreck of some lost galleon or patache to\nvisit once again the glimpses of the Moon. They were of lordly mien,\nwith large aquiline features and haughty eyes. As they passed, one of\nthem turned and looked at me. As his eyes lit on me, I saw spring into\nthem, as though he were quick, dread, and hate, and fear.\n\nHitherto I had been impressed, awed, by the indifference of the passing\nghosts. They had looked nowhere, but with steady, silent, even tread had\npassed on their way. But when this one looked at me it was a glance from\nthe spirit world which chilled me to the very soul.\n\nBut he too passed on. I stood at the head of the winding path, having\nthe dead man still on my shoulders and looking with sinking heart at the\nsad array of the victims of the Cruden Skares. I noticed that most who\ncame now were seamen, with here and there a group of shoresmen and a few\nwomen amongst them. The fishermen were many, and without exception wore\ngreat sea boots. And so with what patience I could I waited for the end.\n\nAt length it came in the shape of a dim figure of great stature, and\nboth of whose arms hung limp. The blood from a gash on his forehead had\nstreamed on to his golden beard, and the golden eyes looked far away.\nWith a shudder I saw that this was the ghost of the man whose body, now\nless warm, lay upon my shoulders; and so I knew that Lauchlane Macleod\nwas dead. I was relieved when I saw that he did not even look at me;\nthough as I moved on, following the procession, he walked beside me with\nequal steps, stopping and moving as I stopped and moved.\n\nThe silence of death was upon the little hamlet of Whinnyfold. There was\nnot a sign of life; not a dog barked as the grim procession had moved up\nthe steep path or now filed across the running stream and moved along\nthe footpath toward Cruden. Gormala with eager eyes kept watching\nme; and as the minutes wore on I began to resume my double action of\nthought, for I could see in her face that she was trying to reason out\nfrom my own expression something of what I was looking at. As we moved\nalong she now began to make suggestions to me in a fierce whisper,\nevidently hoping that she might learn something from my acquiescence in,\nor negation of, her thought. Through that ghostly silence her living\nvoice cut with the harshness of a corncrake.\n\n    \"Shearing the silence of the night with ragged edge.\"\n\nPerhaps it was for the best; looking back now on that awful experience,\nI know that no man can say what his mind may suffer in the aftertime who\nwalks alone with the Dead. That I was strung to some amazing pitch was\nmanifested by the fact that I did not seem to feel the great weight\nwhich lay upon my shoulders. I have naturally vast strength and the\nathletic training of my youth had developed it highly. But the weight of\nan ordinary man is much to hold or carry for even a short time, and the\nbody which I bore was almost that of a giant.\n\nThe path across the neck of land which makes the Skares a promontory is\nflat, with here and there a deep cleft like a miniature ravine where the\nwater from the upland rushes in flood time down to the sea. All these\nrills were now running strong, but I could hear no sound of murmuring\nwater, no splash as the streams leapt over the edge of the cliff on the\nrocks below in whitening spray. The ghostly procession did not pause at\nany of these streams, but moved on impassively to the farther side where\nthe path trends down to the sands of Cruden Bay. Gormala stood a moment\nwatching my eyes as they swept the long line passing the angle so that I\ncould see them all at once. That she guessed something was evident from\nher speech:\n\n\"They are many; his eyes range wide!\" I started, and she knew that she\nhad guessed aright. This one guess seemed to supply her with illimitable\ndata; she evidently knew something of the spirit world, though she could\nnot see into its mysteries. Her next words brought enlightenment to me:\n\n\"They are human spirits; they follow the path that the feet o' men hae\nmade!\"\n\nIt was so. The procession did not float over the surface of field or\nsand, but took its painful way down the zigzag of the cliff and over the\nrocky path through the great boulders of the foreshore. When the head of\nit reached the sand, it passed along the summit of the ridge, just as\nevery Sunday night the fishermen of Whinnyfold and Collieston did in\nreturning to their herring boats at Peterhead.\n\nThe tramp across the sands was long and dreary. Often as I had taken\nthat walk in rain or storm, with the wind almost sweeping me off my feet\nwhilst the sand drift from the bent-covered hills almost cut my cheeks\nand ears, I had never felt the way to be so long or so hard to travel.\nThough I did not realise it at the time, the dead man's weight was\nbeginning to tell sorely upon me. Across the Bay I could see the few\nlights in the village of Port Erroll that were to be seen at such a\ntime of night; and far over the water came the cold grey light which is\nthe sign of the waning of the night rather than of the coming of the\nmorning.\n\nWhen we came to the Hawklaw, the head of the procession turned inward\nthrough the sandhills. Gormala, watching my eyes, saw it and an\nextraordinary change came over her. For an instant she was as if\nstricken, and stood stock still. Then she raised her hands in wonder,\nand said in an awed whisper:\n\n\"The Holy Well! They gang to St. Olaf's well! The Lammas floods will aye\nserve them weel.\"\n\nWith an instinct of curiosity strong upon me I hurried on so as to head\nthe procession. As I moved along the rough path amongst the sandhills I\nfelt the weight of the burden on my shoulders grow heavier and heavier,\nso that my feet dragged as do the feet of one in a night-mare. As I\nmoved on, I looked round instinctively and saw that the shade of\nLauchlane Macleod no longer kept pace with me, but retained its place in\nthe procession. Gormala's evil eye was once more upon me, but with her\ndiabolical cunning she guessed the secret of my looking round. She moved\nalong, not with me but at the rate she had been going as though she\nliked or expected to remain in juxtaposition to the shade of the dead\nman; some purpose of her own was to be fulfilled.\n\nAs I pressed on, the shades around me seemed to grow dimmer and dimmer\nstill; till at the last I could see little more than a film or haze.\nWhen I came to St. Olaf's well--then merely a rough pool at the base of\nthe high land that stretches back from the Hawklaw--the ghostly mist was\nbeginning to fade into the water. I stood hard by, and the weight upon\nmy shoulders became dreadful. I could hardly stand; I determined,\nhowever, to hold on as long as I could and see what would happen. The\ndead man, too, was becoming colder! I did not know whether the dimming\nof the shadows was from this cause, or because the spirit of the man was\nfarther away. It was possibly both, for as the silent, sad procession\ncame on I could see more distinctly. When the wraith of the Spaniard\nturned and looked at me, he seemed once more to look with living eyes\nfrom a living soul. Then there was a dreary wait whilst the rest\ncame along and passed in awesome stillness down into the well and\ndisappeared. The weight upon my shoulders now became momentarily more\nintolerable. At last I could bear it no longer, and half bending I\nallowed the body to slip to the ground, I only holding the hands to\nsteady the descent. Gormala was now opposite to me, and seeing what\nI had done leaped towards me with a loud cry. For one dim moment the\nwraith of the dead man stood above its earthly shell; and then I saw the\nghostly vision no more.\n\nAt that instant, just as Gormala was about to touch the dead body, there\nwas a loud hiss and murmur of waters. The whole pool burst up in a great\nfountain, scattering sand and water around for a wide space. I rushed\nback; Gormala did the same.\n\nThen the waters receded again, and when I looked, the corpse of\nLauchlane Macleod was gone. It was swallowed up in the Holy Well.\n\nOvercome with physical weariness and strange horror of the scene I sank\ndown on the wet sand. The scene whirled round me.... I remember no\nmore.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nTHE MINISTERS OF THE DOOM\n\n\nWhen at last I looked around me I was not surprised at anything I saw;\nnot even at the intense face of Gormala whose eyes, bright in the full\nmoonlight, were searching my face more eagerly than ever. I was lying on\nthe sand, and she was bending over me so closely that her face almost\ntouched mine. It was evident, even to my half-awake sensibilities, that\nshe was listening intently, lest even a whispered word from me should be\nmissed.\n\nThe witch-woman was still seemingly all afire, but withal there was\nmanifested in her face and bearing a sense of disappointment which\ncomforted me. I waited a few minutes until I felt my brain clear, and\nmy body rested from the intolerable strain which it had undergone in\ncarrying that terrific burden from Whinnyfold.\n\nWhen I looked up again Gormala recognised the change in me, and her own\nexpression became different. The baleful glitter of her eyes faded,\nand the blind, unreasoning hate and anger turned to keen inquiry. She\nwas not now merely baffled in her hopes, and face to face with an\nunconscious man; there was at least a possibility of her gaining some\nknowledge, and all the energy of her nature woke again as she spoke:\n\n\"So ye are back wi' the moon and me. Whither went ye when ye lay down\nupon the sand. Was it back ye went, or forrart; wi' the ghaists into the\nHoly Well and beyond in their manifold course; or back to their comin'\nfrae the sea and all that could there be told? Oh! mon, what it is to me\nthat any ither can gang like that into spirit land, and me have to wait\nhere by my lanes; to wring my hands an' torture my hairt in broken\nhopes!\" I answered her question with another:\n\n\"How do you mean that ghosts go into the well and beyond?\" Her answer\nwas at the first given in a stern tone which became, however, softer, as\nshe went on.\n\n\"Knew ye not, that the Lammas Floods are the carriers o' the Dead; that\non Lammas nicht the Dead can win their way to where they will, under the\nairth by wherever there is rinnin' watter. Happy be they that can gain a\nHoly Well, an' so pass into the bowels o' the airth to where they list.\"\n\n\"And how and when do they return?\"\n\n\"Dinna jest wi' Fate an' the Dead. They in their scope can gang and\nreturn again; no een, save your ain, o' man or Seer has seen the method\no' their gangin'. No een, even yours, can see them steal out again in\nthe nicht, when the chosen graves that they hae sought hae taken from\nthem the dross o' the airth.\" I felt it was not wise to talk further, so\nwithout a word I turned and walked home by the sheep tracks amongst the\nsand hills. Now and again I stumbled in a rabbit hole, and as I would\nsink forward the wet bent would brush against my face.\n\nThe walk back in the dark dawn seemed interminable. All this time\nmy mind was in a turmoil. I did not even seem to remember anything\ndefinitely, or think consecutively; but facts and fancies swept through\nmy mind in a chaotic whirl. When I got to the house, I undressed quickly\nand got into bed; I must have instantly fallen into a deep sleep.\n\nNext afternoon I walked by the shore to Whinnyfold. It was almost\nimpossible to believe that I was looking at the same place as on last\nnight. I sat on the cliff where I had sat last night, the hot August\nsun and the cool breeze from the sea being inconceivably soothing. So I\nthought and thought.... The lack of sufficient sleep the night before\nand the tired feeling of the physical strain I had undergone--my\nshoulders still ached--told upon me, and I fell asleep.\n\nWhen I waked Gormala stood in front of me.\n\nAfter a long pause she spoke:\n\n\"I see that ye remember, else would ye ha' spoken to me. Will ye no tell\nme all that ye saw? Then, wi' your Seer's een an' my knowledge o' the\nfact we may thegither win oot the great Secret o' the Sea.\" I felt\nstronger than ever the instinctive conviction that I must remain keenly\non guard with her. So I said nothing; waiting thus I should learn\nsomething, whether from her words or her silence. She could not stand\nthis. I saw her colour rise till her face was all aglow with a red flush\nthat shamed the sunset; and at last the anger blazed in her eyes. It was\nin a threatening tone which she spoke, though the words were themselves\nsufficiently conciliatory:\n\n\"The Secrets o' the Sea are to be won; and tae thee and me it is given\nto win them. What hae been is but an earnest of what will be. For ages\nithers have tried to win but hae failed; and if we fail too for lack o'\npurpose or because ye like me not, then to ithers will come in time the\ngreat reward. For the secrets are there, and the treasures lie awaiting.\nThe way is open for those to whom are the Gifts. Throw not away the\nfavour of the Fates. For if they be kind to give where they will, they\nare hard to thwart, and their revenge is sure!\" I must confess that her\nwords began to weaken my purpose. In one way inexorable logic was on\nher side. Powers such as were mine were surely given for some purpose.\nMight I not be wrong in refusing to use them. If the Final Cause of\nmy powers were purposeful, then might not a penalty be exacted from\nme because I had thwarted the project. Gormala, with that diabolical\ncunning of hers, evidently followed the workings of my mind, for her\nface lit up. How she knew, I know not, but I do know that her eyes never\nleft mine. I suppose it may be that the eyes which have power to see\nat times the inwardness of things have some abnormal power also of\nexpressing the thoughts behind them. I felt, however, that I was in\ndanger. All my instincts told me that once in Gormala's power I should\nrue it, so I spoke out on the instant strongly:\n\n\"I shall have nothing to do with you whatever. Last night when you\nrefused to help me with the wounded man--whom you had followed,\nremember, for weeks, hoping for his death--I saw you in your true\ncolours; and I mean to have nothing to do with you.\" Fierce anger blazed\nagain in her eyes; but again she controlled herself and spoke with an\nappearance of calm, though it was won with great effort, as I could see\nby the tension of her muscles:\n\n\"An' so ye would judge me that I would not help ye to bring the Dead to\nlife again! I knew that Lauchlane was dead! Aye! and ye kent it too as\nweel as I did masel'. It needed no Seer to tell that, when ye brocht him\nup the rocks oot o' the tide. Then, when he was dead, for why wad ye\nno use him? Do the Dead themselves object that they help the livin' to\ntheir ends while the blood is yet warm in them? Is it ye that object to\nthe power of the Dead? You whose veins have the power o' divination of\nthe quick; you to whom the heavens themselves opened, and the airth and\nthe watters under the airth, when the spirit of the Dead that ye carried\nwalked beside ye as ye ganged to St. Olaf's Well. An' as for me, what\nhae I done that you should object. I saw, as you did, that Lauchlane's\nsands were run. You and I are alike in that. To us baith was given to\nsee, by signs that ages have made sacred, that Fate had spoken in his\nears though he had himself not heard the Voice. Nay more, to me was only\ngiven to see that the Voice had spoken. But to you was shown how, and\nwhen, and where the Doom should come, though you yersel' that can read\nthe future as no ither that is known, canna read the past; and so could\nna tell what a lesser one would ha' guessed at lang syne. I followed the\nDoom; you followed the Doom. I by my cunnin'; you when ye waked frae yer\nsleep, followin' yer conviction, till we met thegither for Lauchlane's\ndeath, amid Lammas floods and under the gowden moon on the gowden sea.\nThrough his aid--aye, young sir--for wi'oot a fresh corp to aid, no Seer\no' airth could hae seen as ye did, that lang line o' ghaists ye saw last\nnicht. Through his aid the wonders o' the heavens and the deep, o' airth\nand air, was opened till ye. Wha then be ye that condemn me that only\nsaw a sign an' followed? Gin I be guilty, what be you?\"\n\nIt would be impossible to describe the rude, wild, natural eloquence\nwith which this was spoken. In the sunset, the gaunt woman seemed to\ntower above me; and as she moved her arms, the long shadows of them\nstretched over the green down before us and away over the wrinkled sea\nas though her gestures were, giant like, appealing to all nature.\n\nI was distinctly impressed, for all that she said was quite true. She\nhad in reality done nothing that the law would call wrong. Lauchlane's\ndeath was in no possible way due to any act of hers. She had only\nwatched him; and as he did not even know that she watched he could not\nhave been influenced in any way by it or by her. As to my own part! Her\nwords gave me a new light. Why had I risen in the night and come out to\nWhinnyfold? Was it intuition, or a call from the witch-woman, who in\nsuch case must have had some hypnotic influence over me? Or was it----?\n\nI stood appalled at the unspoken thought. Could it be that the powers\nof Nature which had been revealed to me in the dread hour had not only\nsentience but purpose!\n\nI felt that my tone was more conciliatory as I answered her:\n\n\"I did not mean to blame you for anything you had done. I see now that\nyour wrong was only passive.\" I felt that my words were weak, and my\nfeeling was emphasised by the scorn of her reply:\n\n\"My wrang was only passive! My wrang! What wrang hae I done that you\nshould sit in judgment on me. Could I hae helpit it when Lauchlane met\nhis death amang the rocks in the tide. Why you yoursel' sat here beside\nme, an' ye no helpit him or tried to, strong man though ye be, that\ncould carry his corp frae here to St. Olaf's Well; for ye kenned that no\nlivin' arm could aid him in that hour o' doom. Aye! laddie, the Fates\nknow their wark o'er weel to hae ony such betterment o' their plans! An'\ndiv ye think that by any act o' yer ain, or by any refusal o' act or\nspeech, ye can baffle the purpose o' the Doom. Ye are yet young and\nye must learn; then learn it now whiles ye can, that when the Word is\nspoken all follows as ordained. Aye! though the Ministers o' the Doom be\nmany an' various, an' though they hae to gather in ane from many ages\nan' frae the furthermost ends o' the airth!\"\n\nGormala's logic and the exactness of her statement were too much for me.\nI felt that I owed her some reparation and told her so. She received it\nin her gaunt way with the dignity of an empress.\n\nBut there her dignity stopped; for seeing that she had got a lever\nin her hands she began at once, womanlike, to use it. Without any\nhesitation or delay she asked me straightly to tell her what I had seen\nthe night before. The directness of her questioning was my best help; my\nheart hardened and my lips closed. She saw my answer before I had spoken\nit, and turned away with an eloquent, rugged gesture of despair. She\nfelt that her last hope was gone; that her last bolt had been sped in\nvain.\n\nWith her going, the link with last night seemed to break, and as she\npassed up the road the whole of that strange experience became dimmer\nand dimmer.\n\nI walked home by Cruden sands in a sort of dream. The chill and strain\nof the night before seemed to affect me more and more with each hour.\nFeeling fatigued and drowsy I lay down on my bed and sank into a heavy,\nlethargic sleep.\n\nThe last thing I remember is the sounding of the dinner-gong, and a dim\nresolution not to answer its call....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was weeks after, when the fever had passed away, that I left my bed\nin the Kilmarnock Arms.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nFROM OTHER AGES AND THE ENDS OF THE EARTH\n\n\nThe last week in June of next year, 1898, found me back in Cruden.\nMy own house was in process of building. I had purposely arranged\nwith the builders that the fitting up and what the conveyancers call\n\"beautifyings\" should not be done until I should be on the spot myself\nnext year, to be consulted about everything. Every day I went over\nto see the place and become familiar with it before the plans for\ndecoration should be taken in hand. Still there was no enjoyment in\ngetting wet every time I went and came, or in remaining in wet clothes,\nso that my day was mainly spent at home.\n\nOne of my first visits was to Peterhead which seemed to be in a state of\nabsolute activity, for the herring fishing had been good and trade of\nall kinds was brisk. At the market place which was half full of booths,\ncould be had almost everything required for the needs or comfort of\nlife such as it can be on a fishing boat. Fruit and all sorts of summer\nluxuries were abundant. Being Saturday the boats had returned early and\nhad got their nets away to the drying-grounds, and the men had been able\nto shave and dress tidily. The women, too, had got their dressing done\nearly--the fish first and themselves afterwards.\n\nFor awhile I wandered about aimlessly amongst the booths, with that sort\nof unsatisfaction upon me which had of late been the prelude to many of\nthe manifestations of the power of Second Sight. This used to be just\nas if something within me was groping or searching unsuccessfully for\nsomething unknown, the satisfaction coming with the realization of the\nobjective of the search.\n\nPresently I came to an itinerant auctioneer who was dealing with a small\ncart-load of odds and ends, evidently picked up in various places.\nHis auction or \"roup\" was on the \"Dutch\" plan; an extravagant price,\naccording to his own idea, being placed on each article, and the offer\ndecreasing in default of bidders. The auctioneer was ready with his\ntongue; his patter showed how well he understood the needs and ideas of\nthe class whom he addressed.\n\n\"Here's the works of the Reverend Robert William McAlister of\nTrottermaverish in twal volumes, wantin' the first an' the last twa;\nthree damaged by use, but still full of power in dealing with the\nspeeritual necessities o' men who go down to the great deep in ships. A\nsermon for every day in the year, in the Gaelic for them as has na got\nthe English, an' in good English for them as has. How much for the twal\nvolumes, wantin' but three? Not a bawbee less than nine shellin', goin'\ngoin'. Wha says eight shellin' for the lot. Seven shellin' an' no less.\nGoin' for six. Five shellin' for you sir. Any bidder at four shellin'.\nNot a bawbee less than three shellin'; Half a croon. Any bidder at twa\nshellin'. Gone for you sir!\" the nine volumes were handed over to a\ngrave-looking old man, and the two shillings which he produced from a\nheavy canvas bag duly pocketed by the auctioneer.\n\nEverything he had, found some buyer; even a blue-book seemed to have\nits attraction. The oddness of some of the odd lots was occasionally\namusing. When I had been round the basins of the harbour and had seen\nthe dressings and barrelling of the fish, I again came across the\nauctioneer in the market place. He had evidently been using his time\nwell, for the cart was almost empty. He was just putting up the last\narticle, an old oak chest which up to now he had used as a sort of table\non which to display the object for sale. An old oak chest has always\ncharms for me, and I was about furnishing a house. I stepped over,\nopened the lid and looked in; there were some papers tossed on the\nbottom of it. I asked the auctioneer if the contents went with the\nchest, my real object being to get a look at the lock which seemed a\nvery old one of steel, though it was much damaged and lacked a key. I\nwas answered with a torrent of speech in true auctioneer fashion:\n\n\"Aye, good master. Take the lot just as it stands. An oaken kist,\nhundreds of years aud and still worthy a rest in the house-place of any\nman who has goods to guard. It wants a key, truth to tell; but the lock\nis a fine aud one and you can easy fit a key. Moreover the contents, be\nthey what they may, are yours also. See! aud letters in some foreign\ntongue--French I think. Yellow in age an' the ink faded. Somebody's love\nletters, I'm thinkin'. Come now, young men here's a chance. Maybe if\nye're no that fameeliar in writin' yer hairts oot to the lassies, ye can\nget some hints frae these. They can learn ye, I warrant!\"\n\nI was not altogether unaccustomed to auctions, so I affected a\nnonchalance which I did not feel. Indeed, I was unaccountably excited.\nIt might have been that my feelings and memories had been worked up by\nthe seeing again the pier where first I had met Lauchlane Macleod, and\nthe moving life which then had environed him. I felt coming over me that\nstrange impalpable influence or tendency which had been a part of my\nnature in the days immediately before the drowning of the Out-islander.\nEven as I looked, I seemed to feel rather than see fixed upon me the\nbaleful eyes of the man in the ghostly procession on that Lammas eve. I\nwas recalled to myself by the voice of the auctioneer:\n\n\"The kist and its contents will be sold for a guinea and not a bawbee\nless.\"\n\n\"I take it!\" I cried impulsively. The auctioneer who in his wildest\ndreams had no hope of such a price seemed startled into momentary\ncomparative silence. He quickly recovered himself and said: \"The kist is\nyours, good master; and that concludes the roup!\"\n\nI looked around to see if there was present any one who could even\nsuggest in any way the appearance of the man in the ghostly procession.\nBut there was no such person. I met only _mirabile dictu_, the greedy\neyes of Gormala MacNiel.\n\nThat evening in my room at the Kilmarnock Arms, I examined the papers\nas well as I could by lamplight. They were in an old-fashioned style\nof writing with long tails and many flourishes which made an added\ndifficulty to me. The language was Spanish, which tongue I did not know;\nbut by aid of French and what little Latin I could remember I made out a\nfew words here and there. The dates ranged between 1598 and 1610. The\nletters, of which there were eight, were of manifest unimportance, short\nnotes directed: \"Don de Escoban\" and merely arranging meetings. Then\nthere were a number of loose pages of some printed folio, used perhaps\nas some kind of tally or possibly a cipher, for they were marked all\nover with dots. The lot was completed by a thin, narrow strip of paper\ncovered with figures--possibly some account. Papers of three centuries\nago were valuable, were it only for their style of writing. So I locked\nthem all up carefully before I went to bed, with full intention to\nexamine them thoroughly some day. The appearance of Gormala just at the\ntime when I had become possessed of them seemed to connect them in some\nmysterious way with the former weird experiences in which she had so\nprominent a part.\n\nThat night I dreamed as usual, though my dreaming was of a scattered\nand incoherent character. Gormala's haunting presence and all that had\nhappened during the day, especially the buying of the chest with the\nmysterious papers, as well as what had taken place since my arrival at\nCruden was mixed up in perpetually recurring images with the beginning\nof my Second Sight and the death of Lauchlane Macleod. Again, and again,\nand again, I saw with the eyes of memory, in fragmentary fashion, the\ngrand form of the fisherman standing in a blaze of gold, and later\nfighting his way through a still sea of gold, of which the only reliefs\nwere the scattered piles of black rock and the pale face patched with\nblood. Again, and again, and again, the ghostly procession came up the\nsteep path from the depths of the sea, and passed in slow silent measure\ninto St. Olaf's Well.\n\nGormala's words were becoming a truth to me; that above and around me\nwas some force which was impelling to an end all things of which I could\ntake cognizance, myself amongst the rest. Here I stopped, suddenly\narrested by the thought that it was Gormala herself who had set my mind\nworking in this direction; and the words with which she had at once\nwarned and threatened me when after the night of Lauchlane's death we\nstood at Witsennan point:\n\n\"_When the Word is spoken all follows as ordained. Aye! though the\nMinisters of the Doom may be many and various, and though they may have\nto gather in one from many ages and from the furthermost ends of the\nearth!_\"\n\nThe next few days were delightfully fine, and life was one long\nenjoyment. On Monday evening there was a sunset which I shall never\nforget. The whole western sky seemed ablaze with red and gold; great\nmasses of cloud which had rolled up seemed like huge crimson canopies\nlooped with gold over the sun throned on the western mountains. I was\nstanding on the Hawklaw, whence I could get a good view; beside me was a\nshepherd whose flock patched the steep green hillside as with snow. I\nturned to him and said:\n\n\"Is not that a glorious sight?\"\n\n\"Aye! 'Tis grand. But like all beauty o' the warld it fadeth into\nnaught; an' is only a mask for dool.\"\n\n\"You do not seem to hold a very optimistic opinion of things generally.\"\nHe deliberately stoked himself from his snuff mull before replying:\n\n\"Optimist nor pessimist am I, eechie nor ochie. I'm thinkin' the\noptimist and the pessimist are lears alike; takin' a pairt for\nthe whole, an' so guilty o' the logical sin o' _a particulari ad\nuniversale_. Sophism they misca' it; as if there were anything but a lee\nin a misstatement o' fac'. Fac's is good eneuch for me; an' that, let me\ntell ye, is why I said that the splendour o' the sunset is but a mask\nfor dool. Look yon! The clouds are all gold and glory, like a regiment\ngoin' oot to the battle. But bide ye till the sun drops, not only below\nthe horizon but beyond the angle o' refraction. Then what see ye? All\ngrim and grey, and waste, and dourness and dool; like the army as it\nreturns frae the fecht. There be some that think that because the sun\nsets fine i' the nicht, it will of necessity rise fine i' the morn. They\nseem to no ken that it has to traverse one half o' the warld ere it\nreturns; and that the averages of fine and foul, o' light and dark hae\nto be aye maintained. It may be that the days o' fine follow ane anither\nfast; or that the foul times linger likewise. But in the end, the\nfigures of fine and foul tottle up, in accord wi' their ordered sum.\nWhat use is it, then, to no tak' heed o' fac's? Weel I ken, that the\nfac' o' the morrow will differ sair frae the fac's o' this nicht. Not in\nvain hae I seen the wisdom and glory o' the Lord in sunsets an' dawns\nwi'oot learnin' the lessons that they teach. Mon, I tell ye that it's\nall those glories o' pomp and pageantry--all the lasceevious luxuries\no' colour an' splendour, that are the forerinners o' disaster. Do ye no\nsee the streaks o' wind rinnin' i' the sky, frae the east to the west?\nDo ye ken what they portend? I'm tellin' ye, that before the sun sets\nthe morrow nicht there will be ruin and disaster on all this side o'\nScotland. The storm will no begin here. It is perhaps ragin' the noo\naway to the east. But it will come quick, most likely wi' the risin' o'\nthe tide; and woe be then to them as has no made safe wi' all they can.\nHark ye the stillness!\" Shepherd-like he took no account of his own\nsheep whose ceaseless bleating, sounding in every note of the scale,\nbroke the otherwise universal silence of nature. \"I'm thinkin' it's\nbut the calm before the storm. Weel sir, I maun gang. The yowes say it\nis time for the hame comin'. An' mark ye, the collie! He looks at me\nreproachful, as though I had forgot the yowes! My sairvice to ye, sir!\"\n\n\"Good night\" I answered, \"I hope I shall meet you again.\"\n\n\"I'm thinkin' the same masel'. I hae much enjoyed yer pleasin'\nconverse. I hope it's mony a crack we yet may hae thegither!\" And so my\nphilosophical egoist moved homewards, blissfully unconscious of the fact\nthat my sole contribution to the \"pleasing converse\" was the remark that\nhe did not seem optimistic.\n\nThe whole mass of his charge moved homewards at an even footpace, the\ncollie making frantic dashes here and there to keep his flock headed in\nthe right direction. Presently I saw the herd pouring like a foam-white\nnoisy river across the narrow bridge over the Water of Cruden.\n\nThe next morning was fine, very hot, and of an unusual stillness.\nOrdinarily I should have rejoiced at such a day; but the warning of the\nerudite and philosophical shepherd made me mistrust. To me the worst of\nthe prophecy business was that it became a disturbing influence. To-day,\nperforce, because it was fine, I had to expect that it would end badly.\nAbout noon I walked over to Whinnyfold; it being Saturday I knew that\nthe workmen would have gone away early, and I wanted to have the house\nto myself so that I could go over it quietly and finally arrange the\nscheme of colouring. I remained there some hours, and then, when I had\nmade up my mind as to things, I set off for the hotel.\n\nIn those few hours the weather had changed marvellously. Busy within\ndoors and thinking of something else, I had not noticed the change,\nwhich must have been gradual however speedy. The heat had increased till\nit was most oppressive; and yet through it all there was now and then\na cold shiver in the air which almost made me wince. All was still, so\npreternaturally still that occasional sounds seemed to strike the ear as\ndisturbances. The screaming of the seagulls had mainly ceased, and the\nsound of breaking waves on rocks and shore was at variance with the\nsilence over the sea; the sheep and cattle were so quiet that now and\nagain the \"moo\" of a cow or the bleat of a sheep seemed strangely\nsingle. As I stood looking out seaward there seemed to be rising a cold\nwind; I could not exactly feel it, but I knew it was there. As I came\ndown the path over the beach I thought I heard some one calling--a faint\nfar-away sound. At first I did not heed it, as I knew it could not be\nany one calling to me; but when I found it continued, I looked round.\nThere is at least a sufficient amount of curiosity in each of us to\nmake us look round when there is a calling. At first I could not locate\nit; but then sight came to aid of sound, and I saw out on a rock two\nwomen waving handkerchiefs. The calling manifestly came from them. It\nwas not good for any one to be isolated on a rock at a time when a storm\nwas coming up; and I knew well the rocks which these women were amongst.\nI hurried on as quickly as I could, for there was a good way to go to\nreach them.\n\nNear the south end of Cruden Bay there is a cluster of rocks which juts\nout from shore, something like a cock's spur. Beyond this cluster are\nisolated rocks, many of them invisible at high tide. These form part of\nthe rocky system of the Skares, which spread out fan-like from the point\nof Whinnyfold. Amongst these rocks the sea runs at change of tide with\ngreat force; more than once when swimming there I had been almost\ncarried away. What it was to be carried away amongst the rocks of the\nSkares I knew too well from the fate of Lauchlane Macleod. I ran as fast\nas I could down the steep pathway and along the boulder-strewn beach\ntill I came to the Sand Craigs. As I ran I could see from the quick\ninrush of waves, which though not much at present were gathering force\nevery instant, that the storm which the shepherd had predicted was\ncoming fast upon us. In such case every moment was precious. Indeed it\nmight mean life; and so in breathless haste I scrambled over the rocks.\nBehind the main body of the Sand Craigs are two isolated rocks whose\ntops are just uncovered at high tide, but which are washed with every\nwave. The near one of these is at low water not separated from the main\nmass, but only joined by a narrow isthmus a few feet long, over which\nthe first waves of the turning tide rush vigourously, for it is in the\ndirect sweep of the flowing tide. Beyond this, some ninety or a hundred\nfeet off and separated by a deep channel, is the outer rock, always\nin island form. From this spot at low water is the best view of the\nmultitudinous rocks of the Skares. On all sides they rise round you\nas you stand, the granite seeming yellow with the washing of the sea\nbetween the lines of high and low water; above the latter the black\nseaweed ceases growing. This island is so hidden by the higher rocks\naround it that it cannot be seen from any part of Cruden Bay or from\nPort Erroll across it; it can only be seen from the path leading to\nWhinnyfold. It was fortunate that some one had been passing just then,\nor the efforts of the poor women to attract attention might have been\nmade in vain.\n\nWhen I reached the Sand Craigs I scrambled at once to the farthest point\nof the rocks, and came within sight of the isolated rock. Fortunately\nit was low water. The tide had only lately turned and was beginning to\nflow rapidly through the rocks. When I had scrambled on the second last\nrock I was only some thirty yards from the outermost one and could see\nclearly the two women. One was stout and elderly, the other young and\ntall and of exceeding beauty. The elderly one was in an almost frantic\ncondition of fright; but the younger one, though her face was deadly\npale--and I could see from the anxious glances which she kept casting\nround her that she was far from at ease--was outwardly calm. For an\ninstant there was a curious effect as her pale face framed in dark hair\nstood out against the foam of the tide churning round the far off rocks.\nIt seemed as though her head were dressed with white flowers. As there\nwas no time to lose, I threw off my coat and shoes and braced myself for\na swim. I called as I did so: \"What has become of your boat?\" The answer\ncame back in a clear, young voice of manifestly American intonation:\n\n\"It drifted away. It has gone off amongst those rocks at the headland.\"\n\nI had for a moment an idea that my best plan might be to fetch it first,\nbut a glance at the distance and at the condition of the sea made me see\nthe futility of any such hope. Already the waves were rising so fast\nthat they were beginning to sweep over the crest of the rocks. Even that\nin front of me where the women stood was now topped by almost every\nwave. Without further delay I jumped into the sea and swam across. The\ngirl gave me a hand up the rock, and I stood beside them, the old lady\nholding tight to me whilst I held the younger one and the rising waves\nwashing round our feet. For a moment or two I considered the situation,\nand then asked them if either of them could swim. The answer was in the\nnegative. \"Then,\" I said decisively, \"you must leave yourselves to me,\nand I shall swim across with each of you in turn.\" The old lady groaned.\nI pointed out that there was no other way, and that if we came at once\nit would not be difficult, as the distance was short and the waves were\nnot as yet troublesome. I tried to treat the matter as though it were a\nnice holiday episode so that I might keep up their spirits; but all the\nsame I felt gravely anxious. The distance to swim was only some thirty\nyards, but the channel was deep, and the tide running strong. Moreover\nthe waves were rising, and we should have to get a foothold on the\nslippery seaweed-covered rock. However there was nothing to be done but\nto hasten; and as I was considering how best I should take the old lady\nacross I said:\n\n\"What a pity it is that we haven't even a strong cord, and then we could\npull each other across.\" The girl jumped at the idea and said:\n\n\"There was plenty in the boat, but of course it is gone. Still there\nshould be a short piece here. I took care to fasten the painter to a\npiece of rock; but like a woman forgot to see that the other end was\nfixed to the boat, so that when the tide turned she drifted away with\nthe stream. The fast end should be here still.\" When the coming wave\nhad rolled on she pointed to a short piece of rope tied round a jutting\npiece of rock; its loose end swayed to and fro with every wave. I jumped\nfor it at once, for I saw a possible way out of our difficulty; even if\nthe rope were short, so was the distance, and its strands ravelled might\ncover the width of the channel. I untied the rope as quickly as I could.\nIt was not an easy task, for the waves made it impossible to work except\nfor a few seconds at a time; however, I got it free at last and pulled\nit up. It was only a fragment some thirty feet in length; but my heart\nleaped for I saw my way clear now. The girl saw it too and said at once:\n\n\"Let me help you.\" I gave her one end of the rope and we commenced\nsimultaneously to ravel the piles. It was a little difficult to do,\nstanding as we did upon the uneven surface of the rock with the waves\nrushing over our feet and the old lady beside us groaning and moaning\nand imploring us to hasten. Mostly she addressed herself to me, as in\nsome way the _deus ex machina_ and thus superior to the occasion where\nhelpless women were concerned; but occasionally the wail was directed to\nher companion, who would then, even in that time of stress and hurry,\nspare a moment to lay a comforting hand on her as she said:\n\n\"Hush! oh hush! Do not say anything, dear. You will only frighten\nyourself. Be brave!\" and such phrases of kindness and endearment. Once\nthe girl stopped as a wave bigger than the rest broke over her feet. The\nold lady tried to still her shriek into a moan as she held on to her,\nsaying \"Oh Miss Anita! Oh Miss Anita!\" plaintively over and over again.\n\nAt last we had ravelled the four strands of the rope and I began to knot\nthem together. The result was a rope long enough to reach from rock to\nrock, though it was in places of very doubtful strength. I made a big\nloop at one end of it and put it over the stout lady's head and under\nher armpits. I cautioned both women not to tax the cord too severely by\na great or sudden strain. The elder lady protested against going first,\nbut was promptly negatived by the young lady, whose wishes on the\nsubject were to me a foregone conclusion. I took the loose end of the\nrope and diving into the water swam across to the other rock upon the\ntop of which I scrambled with some little trouble, for the waves, though\nnot as yet in themselves dangerous, made difficult any movement which\nexposed me to their force. I signed to the old lady to slide into the\nsea which, assisted by the girl, she did very pluckily. She gasped and\ngurgled a good deal and clutched the loop with a death grip; but I kept\na steady even strain on the rope whose strength I mistrusted. In a few\nseconds she was safely across, and I was pulling her up by the hands up\nthe rock. When she was firmly fixed I gave her the loose end of the cord\nto hold and swam back with the loop. The girl did not delay or give\nany trouble. As she helped me up the rock I could not but notice what\nstrength she had; her grip of my wet hand was firm and strong, and there\nwas in it no quiver of anxiety. I felt that she had no care for herself,\nnow that her companion was safe. I signalled to the old lady to be\nready; the girl slipped into the water, I going in at the same time and\nswimming beside her. The old lady pulled zealously. So absorbed was she\nin her work that she did not heed my warning cry not to pull too hard.\nShe pulled as though on her strength rested the issue of life and death;\nwith the result that before we were a third of the way across the rope\nbroke and she fell sitting on the rock behind her. For an instant the\ngirl was submerged and came up gasping. In the spasmodic impulse common\nat such moments she gripped me so hard round the neck that I felt\nwe were both in danger. Before we sank I wrenched, though with some\ndifficulty her hands away from me, so that when we rose I had her at\narm's length. For a few seconds I held her so that she could get her\nbreath; and as I did so I could hear the old lady screaming out in an\nagonised way:\n\n\"Marjory! Marjory! Marjory!\" With her breath came back the girl's\nreason, and she left herself to me passively. As I held her by the\nshoulder, a wave sweeping over the rock took us, and in my sudden effort\nto hold her I tore away the gown at her throat. It was quite evident her\nwits were all about her now for she cried out suddenly:\n\n\"Oh, my brooch! my brooch!\" There was no time to waste and no time for\nquestions. When a man has to swim for two in a choppy sea, and when the\nother one is a fully clothed woman, there is little to waste of strength\nor effort. So I swam as I had never done, and brought her up to the rock\nwhere the old lady helped her to scramble to her feet. When I had got my\nbreath I asked her about her brooch. She replied:\n\n\"I would not have lost it for all the world. It is an heirloom.\"\n\n\"Was it gold?\" I asked, for I wanted to know its appearance as I\nintended to dive for it.\n\n\"Yes!\" she said, and without another word I jumped into the channel\nagain to swim to the outer rock, for it was close there it must have\nbeen lost and I could dive from there. The channel between the rocks\nhas a sandy bottom, and it would be easy to see the gold. As I went she\ncalled out to me to come back, not to mind, that she would rather lose\nit a thousand times than have me run any risk, and so forth; things\nmightily pleasant to hear when spoken by such lips. For myself I had\nonly exultation. I had got off both the women without accident, and the\nsea was as yet, not such as to give any concern to a good swimmer. I\ndived from the rock and got bottom easily, the depth being only ten or\ntwelve feet; and after a few seconds looking round me I saw the gleam of\ngold. When I had risen and swam to the inner rock the two women pulled\nme up to my feet.\n\nWhen I gave her the brooch the young lady pressed it to her lips, and\nturning to me with tears in her eyes said:\n\n\"Oh you brave man! You kind, brave man! I would not have lost this for\nanything I call mine. Thank you that you have saved our lives; and\nthat you have saved this for me.\" Then with girlish impulsiveness and\nunpremeditation she put up her face and kissed me.\n\nThat moment, with her wet face to mine, was the happiest of my life.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nA RUN ON THE BEACH\n\n\nThe girl's kiss was so spontaneous and so natural that it could not\nconvey any false impression to me. It was a manifest expression of\ngratitude, and that only. Nevertheless it set my heart beating and my\nveins tingling with delight. From that instant I did not feel quite a\nstranger to the giver; nor could I ever feel as quite a stranger again.\nSomething of the same idea may have passed through the girl's mind, for\nshe blushed and looked around her shyly; but, with a proud lifting of\nher head and a slight stamp of her foot on the rock, she put the matter\nbehind her, for the present. The old lady, in the midst of her concern\nfor her companion and herself, was able to throw a glance of disapproval\non me, as though I had done something wrong; from which I gathered that\nthe younger lady was not only very dear to her, but held in some sort of\nunusual respect as well. It was peculiar that she should in the midst of\nher present condition be able to give a thought to so trivial a thing.\nFor though death did not now stare her in the face, she was cold and\nwet; the rock she stood on was hard and slippery, and the foam of the\nbreaking waves was even now curling around her feet.\n\nShe looked about her apprehensively; she did not know whether or no we\nwere on another isolated rock. I reassured her on this subject, and we\nscrambled as quickly as we could over the rocks on our way shoreward.\nThe elder lady took up most of my time. Here and there in a difficult\nplace, for the wind by now blew so strongly that one found it hard to\nbalance oneself as is necessary when walking on rocks, I offered the\nyounger my hand. At first she firmly declined; but then, manifestly\nthinking it churlish, she relented and let me help her. That kiss was\nevidently rankling in her mind.\n\nBoth the women breathed more freely when we had reached the shore and\nstood secure from the sea. And indeed by this time the view, as we\nlooked back, was enough to frighten one. Great waves topped with white\nwere rolling in from as far as we could see; dashing over the rocks,\nsending up here and there white towers of spray, or rolling in on the\nflat shore in front of us with an ominous roar. Woe betide any one who\nmight be isolated now on any rock beyond; he would be swept off, and\nbeaten on the rocks. The old lady groaned as she saw it, and then said\naudibly a prayer of thankfulness. Even the girl grew white for a moment;\nthen, to my secret joy, unconsciously she drew closer to me. I took\ncontrol of the party.\n\n\"Come,\" I said, \"you mustn't stand here in your wet clothes. Hurry to\nthe hotel and get dried. You will get your death of cold. We must all\nrun! Or hasten, at all events!\" I added, as I took in the dimensions of\nthe elder lady.\n\n\"We have left our trap at the hotel\" said the younger lady as we began\nto walk quickly in the direction of Port Erroll.\n\nAs we were moving off it suddenly struck me that Gormala might have seen\nthe episode of the rescue. The very thought of such a thing filled me\nwith such dismay that I groaned aloud. Not for all the world would I\nhave had her have a hand in this; it was too sacred--too delightful--too\nmuch apart from ordinary things! Whilst I was lost in a reverie of\ninexpressible sweetness for perhaps two or three seconds altogether, I\nwas recalled to myself by the voice of the girl who came close to me:\n\n\"Are you hurt? Please tell me if you are. I am a First Aid.\"\n\n\"Hurt?\" I asked, surprised \"not at all. What on earth makes you think\nso?\"\n\n\"I heard you groan!\"\n\n\"Oh that----\" I began with a smile. Then I stopped, for again the\nhaunting fear of Gormala's interference closed over my heart like a wet\nmist. With the fear, however, came a resolution; I would not have any\ndoubt to torment me. In my glance about the shore, as we came off the\nrocks on to the beach, I had not seen a sign of anyone. At this part of\nthe shore the sandhills have faded away into a narrow flat covered with\nbent-grass, beyond which the land slopes up directly to the higher\nplain. There was not room or place for any one to hide; even one lying\namongst the long bents could be seen at a glance from above. Without a\nword I turned to the left and ran as quickly as I could across the beach\nand up the steep bank of the sandy plateau. With a certain degree of\napprehension, and my heart beating like a trip-hammer--I had certainly\ntaken this matter with much concern--I looked around. Then I breathed\nfreely; there was not a sign of anyone as far as I could see. The wind,\nnow coming fiercely in from the sea, swept the tall bent-grass till it\nlay over, showing the paler green of its under side; the blue-green,\nmetallic shimmer which marks it, and which painters find it so hard to\nreproduce, had all vanished under the stress.\n\nI ran back to join the ladies. The elder one had continued walking\nstolidly along the shore, leaving a track of wet on the half dry sand\nas she went; but the younger one had lingered and came towards me as I\napproached.\n\n\"I hope there was nothing wrong?\" she asked in a most natural way.\n\n\"No,\" I said it without thinking, for there was something about the\ngirl which made me feel as if we were old friends, and I spoke to her\nunconsciously in this strain. \"It's all right. She's not there!\"\n\n\"Who?\" she asked with unconsciousness of any _arri\u00c3\u00a8re pens\u00c3\u00a9e_, an\nunconsciousness similar to my own.\n\n\"Gormala!\" I answered.\n\n\"And who is Gormala?\" For quite a minute or two I walked on without\nspeaking, for I wanted to think before I answered. I felt that it would\nbe hard to explain the odd way in which the Seer-woman seemed to have\nbecome tangled up in my life; and yet I wanted to tell this girl. I\nfeared that she might laugh at me; that she might think me ridiculous;\nthat she might despise me; or even that she might think me a lunatic!\nThen again Gormala might come and tell things to her. There was no\naccounting for what the woman might do. She might come upon us at any\nmoment; she might be here even now! The effect of her following or\nwatching me had begun to tell on my mind; her existence haunted me. I\nlooked around anxiously, and breathed freely. There was no sign of her.\nMy eyes finally fetched up on the face of the girl.... Her beautiful,\ndark eyes were fixed on me with interest and wonder.\n\n\"Well!\" she said, after a pause, \"I don't suppose I'm more inquisitive\nthan my neighbours, but I should just like to know, right here, what's\nwrong with you. You looked round that time just as if you were haunted!\nWhy did you run away that time and search round as if some one had taken\na pot-shot at you and you wanted to locate him? Why did you groan before\nyou went, and come back humming? Who is Gormala, anyhow; and why were\nyou glad that you didn't see her? Why didn't you answer me when I asked\nyou who she was? Why did you walk along with your head up and your eyes\nstaring, as though you were seeing visions? And why----\"\n\nAll at once she stopped, and a swift blush swept over her face and even\nher neck. \"Oh,\" she said in a low tone with a note of pathos in her\nvoice, \"I beg your pardon! my unruly tongue ran away with me. I have no\nright to ask so many questions--and from a stranger too!\" She stopped as\nsuddenly as she had begun.\n\n\"You might have spared me that!\" I said \"I know I have been rude in\ndelaying to answer your question about Gormala; but the fact is that\nthere are so many odd things in connection with her that I was really\nconsidering whether you would think me a fool or a lunatic if I told\nthem to you. And you certainly would not understand why I didn't want\nto see her, if I didn't. And perhaps not even if I did,\" I added as an\nafterthought. The girl's awkwardness slipped from her like a robe; the\nblush merged into a smile as she turned to me and said:\n\n\"This is most interesting. O! do tell me--if you don't mind.\"\n\n\"I shall be delighted\" I said, and I only expressed my thought.\n\"Gormala\" I began; but just then the stout lady in front of us, who was\nnow a considerable way ahead, turned round and called to us. I could\nonly hear \"Miss Anita;\" but the girl evidently understood, for she\ncalled out:\n\n\"All right! We are coming at once!\" and she hurried on. It gave me a\nthrill of pleasure that she said \"we\" not \"I;\" it was sweet to have a\npart in such a comprehension. As we went she turned to me and said:\n\n\"You must tell me all about it; I shan't be happy till I hear the whole\nstory, whatever it is. This is all too lovely and exciting. I hadn't an\nidea when we went out sleepily this morning that there would be so much\nin the day to think of afterwards.\" I felt that I had taken my courage\nin both hands as I said:\n\n\"You'll both dine with me at the hotel, won't you. You have missed\nlunch and must be hungry, so we can dine early. It will be such a true\npleasure to me; and I can tell you all about everything afterwards, if\nwe can manage to get a moment alone.\"\n\nShe paused, and I waited anxiously. Then she spoke with a delightful\nsmile:\n\n\"That must be as Mrs. Jack says. But we shall see!\" With this I had to\nbe content for the present.\n\nWhen we came up to her, Mrs. Jack said in a woeful way:\n\n\"Oh, Miss Anita, I don't know what to do. The sand is so heavy, and my\nclothes are so weighty with the wet, and my boots squish so with the\nwater in them that I'm beginning to think I'll never be able to get warm\nor dry again; though I'm both warm enough and dry enough in other ways.\"\nAs she spoke she moved her feet somewhat after the manner of a bear\ndancing, so as to make her wet boots squeak. I would have liked to have\nlaughed, though I really pitied the poor thing; but a glance at the\nconcern on Miss Anita's face checked me. Very tenderly she began to help\nand comfort the old lady, and looked at me pleadingly to help her. \"Why\ndear\" she said \"no wonder it is hard walking for you with your clothes\nso wringing wet,\" and she knelt down on the wet sand and began to wring\nthem out. I looked around to see what I could do to help. Just opposite,\nwhere we were the outcrop of rock on which the Hawklaw is based sent up\na jagged spur of granite through the sand, close under the bent-covered\nhillocks. I pointed to this and we led the old lady over to it and made\nher sit down on a flat rock. Then we proceeded to wring her out, she\nall the while protesting against so much trouble being taken about\nher. We pulled off her spring-side boots, emptied them out and, with\nconsiderable difficulty, forced them on again. Then we all stood up, and\nthe girl and I took her arms and hurried her along the beach; we all\nknew that nothing could be done for real comfort till we should have\nreached the hotel. As we went she said with gratitude in every note of\nher voice, the words joggling out of her as she bumped along:\n\n\"Oh, my dears, you are very good to me.\"\n\nOnce again the use of the plural gave me pleasure. This time, however,\nit was my head, rather than my heart, which was affected; to be so\nbracketted with Miss Anita was to have hope as well as pleasure.\n\nThings were beginning to move fast with me.\n\nWhen we got to Cruden there was great local excitement, and much running\nto and fro on the part of the good people of the hotel to get dry\nclothes for the strange ladies. None of us gave any detail as to how the\nwetting took place; by some kind of common consent it was simply made\nknown for the time that they had been overtaken by the tide. When once\nthe incomplete idea had been started I took care not to elaborate it. I\ncould see plainly enough that though the elder lady had every wish to be\nprofuse in the expression of her gratitude to me, the younger one not\nonly remained silent but now and again restrained her companion by a\nwarning look. Needless to say, I let things go in their own way; it was\ntoo sweet a pleasure to me to share anything in the way of a secret with\nmy new friend, to imperil such a bliss by any breach of reticence. The\nladies were taken away to bedrooms to change, and I asked that dinner\nfor the three of us might be served in my room. When I had changed my\nown clothes, over which operation I did not lose any time, I waited in\nthe room for the arrival of my guests. Whilst the table was being laid I\nlearned that the two ladies had come to the hotel early in the day in a\ndogcart driven by the younger one. They had given no orders except that\nthe horse should be put up and well cared for.\n\nIt was not long before the ladies appeared. Mrs. Jack began to express\nher gratitude to me. I tried to turn it aside, for though it moved me\na little by its genuineness, I felt somewhat awkward, as though I were\naccepting praise under false pretences. Such service as I had been able\nto render, though of the utmost importance to them, had been so easy of\nexecution to me that more than a passing expression of thanks seemed\nout of place. After all I had only accepted a wetting on behalf of two\nladies placed in an awkward position. I was a good swimmer; and my part\nof the whole proceeding was unaccompanied by any danger whatever, I\nthought, of course, had it been later in the coming of the storm, things\nmight have been very different. Here I shuddered as my imagination gave\nme an instantaneous picture of the two helpless women in the toils of\nthe raging sea amongst those grim rocks and borne by that racing tide\nwhich had done poor Lauchlane Macleod to death. As if to emphasise my\nfears there now came a terrific burst of wind which seemed to sweep over\nthe house with appalling violence. It howled and roared above us, so\nthat every window, chimney and door, seemed to bear the sound right in\nupon us. Overhead was heard, between the burst which shook the windows\nand doors, that vague, booming sound, which conveys perhaps a better\nsense of nature's forces when let loose, than even the concrete\nexpression of their violence. In this new feeling of the possibilities\nof the storm, I realised the base and the truth of the gratitude which\nthe ladies felt; and I also realised what an awful tragedy might have\ncome to pass had I or some one else not come down the path from\nWhinnyfold just when I did.\n\nI was recalled to myself by an expression of concern by Mrs. Jack:\n\n\"Look how pale he has got. I do hope he has not been hurt.\" Mechanically\nI answered:\n\n\"Hurt! I was never better in my life,\" then I felt that my pallor must\nhave left me and that I grew red with pleasure as I heard Miss Anita\nsay:\n\n\"Ah! I understand. He did not have any fear for himself; but he\nis beginning to feel how terrible it was for us.\" The fulness of\nunderstanding on the part of the beautiful girl, her perfect and ready\nsympathy, the exactness of her interpretation of my mind, made for me an\ninexpressible pleasure.\n\nWhen I told Mrs. Jack that I had ventured to claim them both as my\nguests, and hoped that they would honour me by dining with me, she\nlooked at her companion in the same inquiring way which I had already\nnoticed. I could not see the face of the younger lady at the moment as\nit was turned away from me, but her approval was manifest; the answer\nwas made gladly in the affirmative. Then I put forth a hope that they\nwould allow me to have a carriage ready to take them home, whenever they\nmight desire, so that they might feel at ease in remaining till they had\nbeen thoroughly restored after their fatigue. I added that perhaps it\nwould be good for Miss Anita. Mrs. Jack raised her eyebrows slightly,\nand I thought there was a note of distance in her voice, as though she\nresented in a quiet way my mentioning the name:\n\n\"Miss Anita!\" she said; and there was that unconscious stiffening of\nthe back which evidences that one is on guard. I felt somewhat awkward,\nas though I had taken a liberty. The younger lady saw my difficulty, and\nwith a quick smile jumped to the rescue.\n\n\"Oh Mrs. Jack\" she said \"I quite forgot that we were never introduced;\nbut of course he heard you mention my name. It was rather hurried our\nmeeting; wasn't it? We must set it right now.\" Then she added very\ndemurely:\n\n\"Dear Mrs. Jack, will you present to Miss Anita, Mr.----\" she looked at\nme interrogatively.\n\n\"Archibald Hunter\" I said, and the presentation was formally made. Then\nMiss Anita answered my question about the carriage:\n\n\"Thank you for your kind offer, Mr. Archibald Hunter\" I thought she\ndwelt on the name, \"but we shall drive back as we came. The storm will\nnot be quite so bad inland, and as it does not rain the cart will be all\nright; we have plenty of wraps. The lamps are good, and I know the road;\nI noted it well as we came. Is not that right?\" she added, turning to\nher companion.\n\n\"Quite right, my dear! Do just as you like,\" and so the manner of their\ngoing was arranged.\n\nThen we had dinner; a delightful, cosy meal. The fire leaped whenever\nthe wind roared; and as the darkness of the storm made a sort of\npremature nightfall, it gave a pleasant, homely look to everything.\nAfter dinner we sat round the fire, and I think for a time we were\nall content. To me it was so like a dream. To sit there close to the\nbeautiful stranger, and to think of the romantic beginning of our\nacquaintance, was enjoyment beyond words. As yet I did not dare to\ncast a glance forwards; but I was content to wait for that. I had a\nconviction that my own mind was made up.\n\nAfter a little while we all became silent. Mrs. Jack was beginning to\ndoze in her chair, and we two young folk instinctively banded ourselves\ntogether with our youthful superiority over sleep and fatigue. I\nsat quite still; there was something so sweet in this organised\ncompanionship of silence that it enraptured me. I did not need Miss\nAnita's look of caution to remain quiet; there was something in her\nface, some power or quality which was as eloquent as speech. I began to\nthink of it; and the habit of introspection, which had now become a part\nof my nature, asserted itself. How much of this quality I thought, was\nin her face, how much in my own eyes and the brain that lay behind them.\nI was recalled to myself by a whisper:\n\n\"I thought for a moment you were going to sleep too. Hsh!\" she placed a\nfinger on her lip a moment and then tiptoed over to the sofa; taking a\nsoft cushion she placed it under Mrs. Jack's head, which had now fallen\nover sideways upon the arm of the chair. Then she sat beside me again,\nand bending over said softly:\n\n\"While she is asleep would you mind walking down to the beach, I want to\nsee the waves. They must be big by now; I can hear their roaring from\nhere.\"\n\n\"I will go with delight;\" I said \"but you must wrap up properly. It will\nnot do to run any chance of a chill.\"\n\n\"All right, oh wise man! I obey, King Solomon! I shall wait to put on my\nown clothes till I get back; and you can lend me a mackie-coat if you\nwill.\" I got one of mine for her, the newest; and we walked over the\nsandhills to the beach.\n\nThe wind was blowing furiously. It never left off for a moment; but\noccasionally there were bursts of such added violence that we found it\ndifficult to keep our feet. We clung to each other at such moments, and\nthe very sense of the strength which enabled me to shield her somewhat\nfrom the violence of the storm, made a new feeling of love--I could not\nnow disguise it from myself. Something went out from me to her; some\nsubtle feeling which must, I suppose, have manifested itself in some\nway, how I know not, for I kept guard upon myself. For one blissful\nmoment, possibly of forgetfulness, she clung to me as the weak cling to\nthe strong, the clinging of self-surrender which is equally dear to the\nweak and the strong, to the woman and the man. And then she drew herself\nsharply away from me.\n\nThere was no misunderstanding the movement; it was an intentional and\nconscious one, and the motive which lay behind both was her woman's\nmystery. I did not know much about women, but I could make no mistake\nas to this. Inasmuch as Providence has thought fit in its wisdom to\nmake men and women different, it is just as well that each sex should\nat critical times use its own potentialities for its protection and\nadvancement. Herein comes, in the midst of an unnatural civilisation,\nthe true utility of instinct. Since we have lost the need of early\ninformation of the presence of game or of predatory animals or hostile\nmen, even our instincts adapt themselves to our surroundings. Many\nan act which may afterwards seem the result of long and careful\npremeditation is, on reflection, found to be simply the result of that\nform of momentary impulse which is in reality a blind obedience to\nsome knowledge of our ancestors gained through painful experience.\nSome protective or militant instinct whose present exercise is but a\nvariant of its primal use. For an instant the man and the woman were\nantagonistic. The woman shrank, therefore it was the man's interest to\nadvance; all at once the man in me spoke through the bashfulness and\nreticence of years:\n\n\"Why do you shrink from me? Have I done anything?\"\n\n\"Oh no!\"\n\n\"Then why?\" A hot blush mantled her face and neck. Had she been an\nEnglish girl I should not probably have had a direct answer; she would\nhave switched conversation on some safer track, or have, after some\nskirmishing, forbidden the topic altogether. This girl's training,\nhowever, had been different. Her equal companionship in study with boys\nin school and college had taught her the futility of trying to burke a\nquestion when her antagonist was masculine; and the natural pluck and\ndominance--the assertion of individuality which is a part of an American\nwoman's birthright--brought up her pride. Still blushing, but bearing\nherself with additional dignity, she spoke. Had she been more\nself-conscious, and could she have seen herself at the moment, she would\nhave recognised to the full that with so much pride and so much dignity\nshe could well afford to discuss any topic that she chose.\n\n\"The fault is not yours. It is, or it was, my own.\"\n\n\"You mean when I gave you back your brooch?\" The blood deepened and\ndeepened to a painful intensity. In a low voice, in the tone of speech,\nbut with only the power of a whisper she answered me:\n\n\"Yes!\" This was my chance and I said with all the earnestness I had, and\nwhich I felt to the full:\n\n\"Let me say something. I shall not ever allude to it again unless you\nwish. I took that sweet acknowledgment of your gratitude exactly as it\nwas meant. Do believe that I am a gentleman. I have not got a sister, I\nam sorry to say, but if I had, I should not mind her giving a kiss to a\nstranger under such circumstances. It was a sweet and womanly act and I\nrespect--and--like you more for it. I wouldn't, of course, for all the\nworld you hadn't done it; and I shall never forget it. But believe me\nI shall never forget myself on account of it. If I did I should be a\nhowling cad;--and--that's all.\"\n\nAs I spoke her face brightened and she sighed with an expression of\nrelief. The blush almost faded away, and a bright smile broke over her\nface. With a serious deep look in the eyes which glistened through her\nsmile she held out her hand and said:\n\n\"You are a good fellow, and I thank you with all my heart.\"\n\nI felt as if I walked on air as we forced our way through the storm\nwhich roared around us, over the sandhills towards the sea. It was with\nan exultation that made my head swim that I noticed that she kept step\nwith me.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nCONFIDENCES AND SECRET WRITING\n\n\nThe shore was a miracle of wild water and white foam. When the wind\nblows into Cruden Bay there is no end or limit to the violence of waves,\nwhich seem to gather strength as they rush over the flat expanse of\nshore. The tide was now only half in, and ordinarily there would have\nbeen a great stretch of bare sand between the dunes and the sea.\nTo-night, however, the piling up of the waters sent in an unnatural tide\nwhich swept across the flat shore with exceeding violence. The roaring\nwas interminable, and as we stood down on the beach we were enveloped\nin sheets of flying foam. The fierce blasts came at moments with such\nstrength that it was physically impossible for us to face them. After a\nlittle we took shelter behind one of the wooden bathing-boxes fastened\ndown under the sandhills. Here, protected from the direct violence\nof the storm, the shelter seemed like a calm from which we heard the\nroaring of wind and wave as from far off. There was a sense of cosiness\nin the shelter which made us instinctively draw close together. I could\nhave remained happy in such proximity forever, but I feared that it\nwould end at any moment. It was therefore, with delight that I heard the\nvoice of Miss Anita, raised to suit the requirements of the occasion:\n\n\"Now that we are alone, won't you tell me about Gormala and the strange\noccurrences?\" I tried to speak, but the storm was too great for the\npurposes of narrative. So I suggested that we should come behind the\nsandhill. We went accordingly, and made a nest in a deep hollow behind\nthe outer range of hillocks. Here crouched among the tall bent, which\nflew like whip lashes when the wilder bursts of the storm came, and amid\na never-ending scourge of fine sand swept from the top of the sandhills,\nI told her of all my experiences of Gormala and Second Sight.\n\nShe listened with a rapt attention. At times I could not see her face,\nfor the evening was closing in and the driving clouds overhead, which\nkept piling up in great masses along the western horizon, shut out the\nremnants of the day. When, however, in the pauses of drifting sand and\nflying foam I could see her properly, I found her face positively alight\nwith eager intelligence. Throughout, she was moved at times, and now and\nagain crept a little closer to me; as for instance when I told her of\nthe dead child and of Lauchlane Macleod's terrible struggle for life\nin the race of the tide amongst the Skares. Her questions were quite\nilluminating to me at moments, for her quick woman's intuition grasped\npossibilities at which my mere logical faculties had shied. Beyond all\nelse, she was interested in the procession of ghosts on Lammas Eve. Only\nonce during my narrative of this episode she interrupted me; not an\nintentional interruption but a passing comment of her own, candidly\nexpressed. This was where the body of armed men came along; at which she\nsaid with a deep hissing intake of her breath through her teeth:\n\n\"Spaniards! I knew it! They were from some lost ship of the Armada!\"\nWhen I spoke of the one who turned and looked at me with eyes that\nseemed of the quick, she straightened her back and squared her\nshoulders, and looking all round her alertly as though for some hidden\nenemy, clenched her hands and shut her lips tightly. Her great dark eyes\nseemed to blaze; then she grew calm again in a moment.\n\nWhen I had finished she sat silent for a while, her eyes fixed in front\nof her as with one whose mind is occupied with introspection. Suddenly\nshe said:\n\n\"That man had some secret, and he feared you would discover it. I can\nsee it all! He, coming from his grave, could see with his dead eyes what\nyou could see with your living ones. Nay, more; he could, perhaps, see\nnot only that you saw, and what you saw, but where the knowledge would\nlead you. That certainly is a grand idea of Gormala's, that of winning\nthe Secret of the Sea!\" After a pause of a few moments she went on,\nstanding up as she did so and walking restlessly to and fro with\nclenched hands and flashing eyes:\n\n\"And if there be any Secrets of the Sea why not win them? If they be of\nSpain and the Spaniard, why not, a thousand times more, win them. If the\nSpaniard had a secret, be sure it was of no good to our Race. Why--\" she\nmoved excitedly as she went on: \"Why this is growing interesting beyond\nbelief. If his dead eyes could for an instant become quick, why should\nnot the change last longer? He might materialise altogether.\" She\nstopped suddenly and said: \"There! I am getting flighty as usual. I\nmust think it all over. It is all too wonderful and too exciting for\nanything. You will let me ask you more about it, won't you, when we meet\nagain?\"\n\nWhen we meet again! Then we would meet again: The thought was a delight\nto me; and it was only after several rapturous seconds that I answered\nher:\n\n\"I shall tell you all I know; everything. You will be able to help me in\ndiscovering the Mystery; perhaps working together we can win the Secret\nof the Sea.\"\n\n\"That would be too enchanting!\" she said impulsively, and then stopped\nsuddenly as if remembering herself. After a pause she said sedately:\n\n\"I'm afraid we must be going back now. We have a long way to drive; and\nit will be quite late enough anyhow.\"\n\nAs we moved off I asked her if I might not see her and Mrs. Jack safely\nhome. I could get a horse at the hotel and drive with them. She laughed\nlightly as she answered:\n\n\"You are very kind indeed. But surely we shall not need any one! I\nam a good driver; the horse is perfect and the lamps are bright. You\nhaven't any 'hold-ups' here as we have Out West; and as I am not within\nGormala's sphere of influence, I don't think there is anything to\ndread!\" Then after a pause she added:\n\n\"By the way have you ever seen Gormala since?\" It was with a queer\nfeeling which I could not then analyse, but which I found afterwards\ncontained a certain proportion of exultation I answered:\n\n\"Oh yes! I saw her only two days ago--\" Here I stopped for I was struck\nwith a new sense of the connection of things. Miss Anita saw the wonder\nin my face and drawing close to me said:\n\n\"Tell me all about it!\" So I told her of the auction at Peterhead and of\nthe chest and the papers with the mysterious marks, and of how I thought\nit might be some sort of account--\"or,\" I added as a new idea struck\nme--\"secret writing.\" When I had got thus far she said with decision:\n\n\"I am quite sure it is. You must try to find it out. Oh, you must, you\nmust!\"\n\n\"I shall,\" said I, \"if you desire it.\" She said nothing, but a blush\nspread over her face. Then she resumed her movement towards the hotel.\n\nWe walked in silence; or rather we ran and stumbled, for the fierce\nwind behind us drove us along. The ups and downs of the surface were\nveiled with the mist of flying sand swept from amongst the bent-grass\non the tops of the sandhills. I would have liked to help her, but a\njudicious dread of seeming officious--and so losing a step in her good\ngraces--held me back. I felt that I was paying a price of abstinence for\nthat kiss. As we went, the silence between us seemed to be ridiculous;\nso to get over it I said, after searching in my mind for a topic which\nwould not close up her sympathies with me:\n\n\"You don't seem to like Spaniards?\"\n\n\"No,\" she answered quickly, \"I hate them! Nasty, cruel, treacherous\nwretches! Look at the way they are treating Cuba! Look at the _Maine_!\"\nThen she added suddenly:\n\n\"But how on earth did you know I dislike them.\" I answered:\n\n\"Your voice told me when you spoke to yourself whilst I was telling you\nabout the ghosts and the man with the eyes.\"\n\n\"True,\" she said reflectively. \"So I did. I must keep more guard on\nmyself and not let my feelings run away with me. I give myself away so\nawfully.\" I could have made a reply to this, but I was afraid. That kiss\nseemed like an embodied spirit of warning, holding a sword over my head\nby a hair.\n\nIt was not long before I found the value of my silence. The lady's\nconfidence in my discretion was restored, and she began, of her own\ninitiative, to talk. She spoke of the procession of ghosts; suddenly\nstopping, however, as if she had remembered something, she said to me:\n\n\"But why were you so anxious that Gormala should not have seen you\nsaving us from the rock?\"\n\n\"Because,\" I answered, \"I did not want her to have anything to do with\nthis.\"\n\n\"What do you mean by 'this'?\" There was something in the tone of her\nquery which set me on guard. It was not sincere; it had not that natural\nintonation, even, all through, which marks a question put in simple\nfaith. Rather was it in the tone of one who asks, knowing well the\nanswer which will or may be given. As I have said, I did not know much\nabout women, but the tone of coquetry, no matter how sweet, no matter\nhow ingenuous, no matter how lovable, cannot be mistaken by any man with\nred blood in his veins! Secretly I exulted, for I felt instinctively\nthat there rested some advantage with me in the struggle of sex. The\nknowledge gave me coolness, and brought my brain to the aid of my heart.\nNothing would have delighted me more at the moment than to fling myself,\nactually as well as metaphorically, at the girl's feet. My mind was made\nup to try to win her; my only thought now was the best means to that\nend. I felt that I was a little sententious as I replied to her\nquestion:\n\n\"By 'this' I mean the whole episode of my meeting with you.\"\n\n\"And Mrs. Jack,\" she added, interrupting me.\n\n\"And Mrs. Jack, of course,\" I went on, feeling rejoiced that she had\ngiven me an opportunity of saying something which I would not otherwise\nhave dared to say. \"Or rather I should perhaps say, my meeting with Mrs.\nJack and her friend. It was to me a most delightful thing to meet with\nMrs. Jack; and I can honestly say this day has been the happiest of my\nlife.\"\n\n\"Don't you think we had better be getting on? Mrs. Jack will be waiting\nfor us!\" she said, but without any kind of reproach in her manner.\n\n\"All right,\" I answered, as I ran up a steep sandhill and held out my\nhand to help her. I did not let her hand go till we had run down the\nother side, and up and down another hillock and came out upon the flat\nwaste of sand which lay between us and the road, and over which a sort\nof ghostly cloud of sand drifted.\n\nBefore we left the sand, I said earnestly:\n\n\"Gormala's presence seems always to mean gloom and sorrow, weeping and\nmourning, fear and death. I would not have any of them come near you or\nyours. This is why I thanked God then, and thank Him now, that in our\nmeeting Gormala had no part!\"\n\nShe gave me her hand impulsively. As for an instant her soft palm lay\nin my palm and her strong fingers clasped mine, I felt that there was a\nbond between us which might some day enable me to shield her from harm.\n\nWhen Mrs. Jack, and 'her friend', were leaving the hotel, I came to\nthe door to see them off. She said to me, in a low voice, as I bade\nfarewell:\n\n\"We shall, I daresay, see you before long. I know that Mrs. Jack intends\nto drive over here again. Thank you for all your kindness. Good night!\"\nThere was a shake of the reins, a clatter of feet on the hard road, a\nsweeping round of the rays of light from the lamp as the cart swayed at\nthe start under the leap forward of the high-bred horse and swung up the\nsteep inland roadway. The last thing I saw was a dark, muffled figure,\ntopped by a tam-o'-shanter cap, projected against the mist of moving\nlight from the lamp.\n\nNext morning I was somewhat _distrait_. Half the night I had lain awake\nthinking; the other half I had dreamt. Both sleeping and waking dreams\nwere mixed, ranging from all the brightness of hope to the harrowing\npossibilities of vague, undefined fear.\n\nSleeping dreams have this difference over day dreams, that the\npossibilities become for the time actualities, and thus for good and\nill, pleasure or pain, multiply the joys or sufferings. Through all,\nhowever, there remained one fixed hope always verging toward belief, I\nshould see Miss Anita--Marjory--again.\n\nLate in the afternoon I got a letter directed in a strange hand, fine\nand firm, with marked characteristics and well formed letters, and just\nenough of unevenness to set me at ease. I am never quite happy with the\nwriter whose hand is exact, letter by letter, and word by word, and line\nby line. So much can be told by handwriting, I thought, as I looked at\nthe letter lying beside my plate. A hand that has no characteristics is\nthat of a person insipid; a hand that is too marked and too various is\ndisconcerting and undependable. Here my philosophising came to an end,\nfor I had opened the envelope, and not knowing the writing, had looked\nat the signature, \"Marjory Anita.\"\n\nI hoped that no one at the table d'hote breakfast noticed me, for I felt\nthat I was red and pale by turns. I laid the letter down, taking care\nthat the blank back page was uppermost; with what nonchalance I could I\nwent on with my smoked haddie. Then I put the letter in my pocket and\nwaited till I was in my own room, secure from interruption, before I\nread it.\n\nThat one should kiss a letter before reading it, is conceivable,\nespecially when it is the first which one has received from the girl he\nloves.\n\nIt was not dated nor addressed. A swift intuition told me that she had\nnot given the date because she did not wish to give the address; the\nabsence of both was less marked than the presence of the one alone. It\naddressed me as \"Dear Mr. Hunter.\" She knew my name, of course, for I\nhad told it to her; it was on the envelope. The body of the letter said\nthat she was asked by Mrs. Jack to convey her warm thanks for the great\nservice rendered; to which she ventured to add the expression of her own\ngratitude. That in the hurry and confusion of mind, consequent on their\nunexpected position, they had both quite forgotten about the boat which\nthey had hired and which had been lost. That the owner of it would no\ndoubt be uneasy about it, and that they would both be grateful if I\nwould see him--he lived in one of the cottages close to the harbour of\nPort Erroll--and find out from him the value of the boat so that Mrs.\nJack might pay it to him, as well as a reasonable sum for the loss of\nits use until he should have been able to procure another. That Mrs.\nJack ventured to give him so much trouble, as Mr. Hunter had been\nalready so kind that she felt emboldened to trespass upon his goodness.\nAnd was \"yours faithfully, 'Marjory Anita.'\" Of course there was a\npostscript--it was a woman's letter! It ran as follows:\n\n  \"Have you deciphered those papers? I have been thinking over them as\n  well as other things, and I am convinced they contain some secret.\n  You must tell me all about them when I see you on Tuesday.\n\n  M.\"\n\nI fear that logic, as understood in books, had little to do with my kiss\non reading this; the reasoning belonged to that higher plane of thought\non which rests the happiness of men and women in this world and the\nnext. There was not a thought in the postscript which did not give me\njoy--utter and unspeakable joy; and the more I thought of it and the\noftener I read it the more it seemed to satisfy some aching void in my\nheart, \"Have you deciphered the papers\"--the papers whose existence was\nonly known to her and me! It was delightful that we should know so much\nof a secret in common. She had been 'thinking over them'--and other\nthings! 'Other things!'--I had been thinking of other things; thinking\nof them so often that every detail of their being or happening was\nphotographed not only on my memory but seemingly on my very soul. And\nof all these 'other things' there was one!!...\n\nTo see her again; to hear her voice; to look in her eyes; to see her\nlips move and watch each varying expression which might pass across that\nlovely face, evoked by thoughts which we should hold in common; to touch\nher hand....\n\nI sat for a while like one in a rapturous dream, where one sees all the\nhopes of the heart fulfilled in completeness and endlessly. And this was\nall to be on Tuesday next--Only six days off!...\n\nI started impulsively and went to the oak chest which stood in the\ncorner of my room and took out the papers.\n\nAfter looking over them carefully I settled quietly down to a minute\nexamination of them. I felt instinctively that my mandate or commission\nwas to see if they contained any secret writing. The letters I placed\naside, for the present at any rate. They were transparently simple\nand written in a flowing hand which made anything like the necessary\nelaboration impossible. I knew something of secret writing, for such had\nin my boyhood been a favourite amusement with me. At one time I had been\nan invalid for a considerable period and had taken from my father's\nlibrary a book by Bishop Wilkins, the brother-in-law of Oliver Cromwell,\ncalled \"Mercury: or the Secret and Swift Messenger.\" Herein were given\naccounts of many of the old methods of secret communication, ciphers,\nstring writing, hidden meanings, and many of the mechanical devices\nemployed in an age when the correspondence of ambassadors, spies and\nsecret agents was mainly conducted by such means. This experience had\nset my mind somewhat on secret writing, and ever after when in the\ncourse of miscellaneous reading I came across anything relating to the\nsubject I made a note of it. I now looked over the papers to see if I\ncould find traces of any of the methods with which I was acquainted;\nbefore long I had an idea.\n\nIt was only a rudimentary idea, a surmise, a possibility; but still it\nwas worth going into. It was not any cause of undue pride to me, for it\ncame as a corollary to an established conclusion, rather than as a fine\npiece of reasoning from acute observation. The dates of the letters gave\nthe period as the end of the sixteenth century, when one of the best\nciphers of that time had been conceived, the \"Biliteral Cipher\" of\nFrancis Bacon. To this my attention had been directed by the work\nof John Wilkins and I had followed it out with great care. As I was\nfamiliar with the principle and method of this cipher I was able to\ndetect signs of its existence; and this being so, I had at once strong\nhopes of being able to find the key to it. The Biliteral cipher has as\nits great advantage, that it can be used in any ordinary writing, and\nthat its forms and methods are simply endless. All that it requires in\nthe first instance is that there be some method arranged on between the\nwriter and the reader of distinguishing between different forms of the\nsame letter. In my desk I had a typewritten copy of a monograph on the\nsubject of the Biliteral cipher, in which I half suggested that possibly\nBacon's idea might be worked out more fully so that a fewer number of\nsymbols than his five would be sufficient. Leaving my present occupation\nfor a moment I went and got it; for by reading it over I might get some\nclue to aid me. Some thought which had already come to me, or some\nconclusion at which I had already arrived might guide me in this new\nlabyrinth of figures, words and symbols.[1]\n\n      [1] See Appendix A.\n\nWhen I had carefully read the paper, occasionally referring to the\ndocuments before me, I sat down and wrote a letter to Miss Anita\ntelling her that I had undertaken the task at once on her suggestion and\nthat I surmised that the method of secret writing adopted if any, was\nprobably a variant of the Biliteral cipher. I therefore sent her my own\nmonograph on the subject so that if she chose she might study it and be\nprepared to go into the matter when we met. I studiously avoided saying\nanything which might frighten her or make any barrier between us;\nmatters were shaping themselves too clearly for me to allow myself to\nfall into the folly of over-precipitation. It was only when I had\nplaced the letter with its enclosure in the envelope and written\nMarjory's--Miss Anita's--name that I remembered that I had not got her\naddress. I put it in my pocket to keep for her till we should meet on\nTuesday.\n\nWhen I resumed my work I began on the two remaining exhibits. The first\nwas a sheaf of some thirty pages torn out of some black-letter law-book.\nThe only remarkable thing about it was that every page seemed covered\nwith dots--hundreds, perhaps thousands on each page. The second was\nquite different: a narrow slip of paper somewhat longer than a half\nsheet of modern note paper, covered with an endless array of figures in\neven lines, written small and with exquisite care. The paper was just\nsuch a size as might be put as marker in an ordinary quarto; that it had\nbeen so used was manifest by the discolouration of a portion of it that\nhad evidently stuck out at the top of the volume. Fortunately, in its\nlong dusty rest in the bookshelf the side written on had been downward\nso that the figures, though obscured by dust and faded by light and\nexposure to the air, were still decipherable. This paper I examined most\ncarefully with a microscope; but could see in it no signs of secret\nwriting beyond what might be contained in the disposition of the numbers\nthemselves. I got a sheet of foolscap and made an enlarged copy, taking\ncare to leave fair space between the rows of figures and between the\nfigures themselves.\n\nThen I placed the copy of figures and the first of the dotted pages side\nby side before me and began to study them.\n\nI confined my attention at first chiefly to the paper of figures, for it\nstruck me that it would of necessity be the simpler of the two systems\nto read, inasmuch as the symbols should be self-contained. In the dotted\nletters it was possible that more than one element existed, for the\ndisposition of significants appeared to be of endless variety, and\nthe very novelty of the method--it being one to which the eyes and the\nsenses were not accustomed--made it a difficult one to follow at first.\nI had little doubt, however, that I should ultimately find the dot\ncipher the more simple of the two, when I should have learned its secret\nand become accustomed to its form. Its mere bulk made the supposition\nlikely that it was in reality simple; for it would be indeed an endless\ntask, to work out in this laborious form two whole sheets of a\ncomplicated cipher.\n\nOver and over and over again I read the script of numbers. Forward and\nbackward; vertically; up and down, for the lines both horizontal and\nvertical were complete and exact, I read it. But nothing struck me of\nsufficient importance to commence with as a beginning.\n\nOf course there were here and there repetitions of the same combination\nof figures, sometimes two, sometimes three, sometimes four together; but\nof the larger combinations the instances were rare and did not afford me\nany suggestion of a clue!\n\nSo I became practical, and spent the remainder of my work-time that day\nin making by aid of my microscope an exact but enlarged copy, but in\nRoman letters, of the first of the printed pages.\n\nThen I reproduced the dots as exactly as I could. This was a laborious\ntask indeed. When the page was finished, half-blinded, I took my hat and\nwent out along the shore towards Whinnyfold. I wanted to go to the Sand\nCraigs; but even to myself I said 'Whinnyfold' which lay farther on.\n\n\"Men are deceivers ever,\" sang Balthazar in the play: they deceive\neven themselves at times. Or they pretend they do--which is a new and\nadvanced form of the same deceit.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nA CLEAR HORIZON\n\n\nIf any ordinary person be afflicted with ennui and want something\nto take his thoughts away from a perpetual consideration of his own\nweariness let me recommend him to take up the interpretation of secret\nwriting. At first, perhaps, he may regard the matter lightly and be\ninclined to smile at its triviality. But after a little while, if he\nhave in him at all any of the persistence or doggedness which is, and\nshould be, a part of a man's nature, he will find the subject take\npossession of him to the almost entire exclusion of all else. Turn from\nit how he will; make he never so many resolutions to put the matter\nbehind him; try he never so hard to find some more engrossing topic, he\nwill still find the evasive mystery ever close before him. For my own\npart I can honestly say that I ate, drank, slept and dreamed secret\nwriting during the entire of the days and nights which intervened\nbetween my taking up the task and the coming of Miss Anita to Cruden\nBay. All day long the hidden mystery was before me; wherever I was, in\nmy room, still or contorting myself; walking on the beach; or out on the\nheadlands, with the breezes singing in my ears, and the waves lapping\nbelow my feet. Hitherto in my life my only experience of haunting\nhad been that of Gormala; but even that experience failed before the\never-hopeful, ever-baffling subject of the cryptograms. The worst of my\nfeeling, and that which made it more poignant, was that I was of the\nfirm belief not only that there was a cryptogram but that my mind was\nalready on the track of it. Every now and again, sometimes when the MS.\nor its copy was before me and sometimes when I was out in the open,\nfor the moment not thinking of it at all, a sort of inspiration would\ncome to me; some sort of root idea whose full significance I felt it\ndifficult to grasp.\n\nMy first relief came on Tuesday when at noon I saw the high dog-cart\ndash past the gate and draw up short opposite the post-office.\n\nI did not lose any time in reaching the cart so as to be able to help\nthe ladies down. Marjory gave me both her hands and jumped lightly, but\nthe elder lady required a good deal of help. It is always thus; the\nexperience of every young man is the same. Every woman, old or young,\nexcept the one whom he likes to lift or carry tenderly, is willing to be\nlifted or carried in the most leisurely or self-denying manner.\n\nWhen Mrs. Jack and 'her friend' had come into the hotel sitting-room the\nlatter said to me:\n\n\"I hope you forgive us for all the trouble we have put you to.\"\n\n\"No trouble at all,\" I answered--and oh! it sounded so tame--\"only a\npleasure!\" \"Thank you,\" she continued gravely, \"that is very nice of\nyou. Now we want you to add to your kindness and take us out again on\nthat rock. I have not yet finished my sketch, and I don't like to be\nbaffled.\"\n\n\"Finished your sketch, my dear,\" said Mrs. Jack, in a tone which\nmanifestly showed that the whole thing was new to her. \"Why, Marjory, it\nwas washed into the sea before Mr. Hunter came to help us!\" The slight,\nquick blush which rose to her face showed that she understood the false\nposition in which the maladroit remark placed her; but she went on\npluckily:\n\n\"Oh, yes, dear, I know! What I mean is, that having set my heart on\nmaking that sketch, I want to do it; even if my first effort went wrong.\nThat is, dear Mrs. Jack, if you do not mind our going out there again.\"\n\n\"Oh, my dear,\" said the elder lady, \"of course I will do just whatever\nyou wish. But I suppose it will do if I sit on the rock near at hand?\nSomehow, since our experience there, I seem to prefer the mainland than\nany place where you may have to swim to get away from it.\" Marjory\nsmiled at me as she said to her:\n\n\"That will do capitally. And you can keep the lunch basket; and have\nyour eye on me and the rising of the tide all the time.\"\n\nSo I sent to Whinnyfold to have a boat ready when we should drive over.\nWhilst the ladies were preparing themselves for the boating trip I\nwent to my room and took in my pocket the papers from the chest and my\nrescripts. I took also the letter which I had not been able to deliver.\n\nAt Whinnyfold Miss Anita and I took the steep zigzag to the beach,\npiloted by one of John Hay's boys whilst the other took Mrs. Jack across\nthe neck of the headland to the Sand Craigs.\n\nAs we went down the steep path, the vision of the procession of ghosts\nmoving steadily up it on Lammas Eve, came back to me; instinctively I\nlooked round to see if Gormala was watching. I breathed more freely when\nI saw she was not about.\n\nI should dearly have liked to take Miss Anita alone in the boat, but I\nfeared that such was not safe. Rowing amongst the rocks of the Skares is\nat the best of times no child's play, and I was guardian of too great a\ntreasure to be willing to run any risks. Young Hay and I pulled, the boy\nbeing in the bow and doing the steering. This position of affairs suited\nme admirably, for it kept me close to my companion and facing her. It\nwas at all times a pleasure to me as it would have been to any man, to\nwatch her face; but to-day her eager joy at the beauty of all around her\nmade me thrill with delight. The day was ideal for the place; a bright,\nclear day with just a ripple of wind from the water which took the edge\nfrom the July heat. The sea quivered with points of light, as though it\nwere strewn with diamonds, and the lines of the racing tide threading a\nway amongst the rocks below were alone an endless source of interest.\nWe rowed slowly which is much the safest way of progression in these\nwaters, and especially when, as now, the tide was running towards the\nend of the ebb. As the boy seemed to know every one of the myriad rocks\nwhich topped the water, and by a sort of instinct even those that lay\nbelow, we steered a devious course. I had told him to take us round by\nthe outer rocks from which thousands of seabirds rose screaming as we\napproached; and as we crept in under the largest of them we felt that\nmysterious sense of unworthiness which comes to one in deep water under\nthe shadow of rocks. I could see that Marjory had the sense of doubt,\nor of possible danger, which made her clutch hard at each gunwale of\nthe boat till her knuckles grew white. As we rounded the Reivie o'\nPircappies, and found the tide swirling amongst the pointed rocks,\nshe grew so deadly pale that I felt concerned. I should have liked to\nquestion her, but as I knew from my experience of her courage that she\nwould probably prefer that I remained silent, I pretended not to notice.\nMale pretence does not count for much with women. She saw through me\nat once, and with a faint smile, which lit the pallor of her face like\nsunshine on snow, she said in so low a whisper that it did not reach the\nfisher boy:\n\n\"I was thinking what it would have been for us that day--only for you.\"\n\n\"I was glad,\" I answered in an equally low voice, \"to be able to render\nany help to--to Mrs. Jack and her friend.\"\n\n\"Mrs. Jack--and her friend--are very much obliged to you,\" she answered\ngaily in her natural voice and tone. I could see that she had fully\nregained her courage, as involuntarily she took her hands from the sides\nof the boat. We kept now well out from the rocks and in deep water,\nand shortly sighted the Sand Craigs. As we could see Mrs. Jack and her\nescort trudging leisurely along the sand, and as we did not wish to\nhurry her, I asked young Hay with my companion's consent, to keep\nround the outermost of the Sand Craigs, which was now grey-white with\nsea-gulls. On our approach the birds all rose and wheeled round with\nmyriad screaming; the wonder and admiration of the girl's eyes as they\neagerly followed the sweep of the cloud of birds was good to see.\n\nWe hung around the great pointed rock till we saw Mrs. Jack making her\nway cautiously along the rocks. We rowed at once to the inner rock and\nplaced the luncheon basket in a safe place. We then prepared a little\nsheltered nook for Mrs. Jack, with rugs and cushions so that she might\nbe quite at ease. Miss Anita chose the place herself. I am bound to say\nit was not just as I should have selected; for when she sat down, her\nback was towards the rock from which she had been rescued. It was\ndoubtless the young girl's thoughtfulness in keeping her mind away from\na place fraught with such unpleasant memories.\n\nWhen she was safely installed we dismissed the boys till the half tide.\nMrs. Jack was somewhat tired with her trudge over the sand, and even\nwhen we left her she was nodding her head with coming sleep. Then Miss\nAnita got out her little easel which I fixed for her as she directed;\nwhen her camp stool was rightly placed and her palette prepared I sat\ndown on the rock at her feet and looked at her whilst she began her\nwork. For a little while she painted in silence: then turning to me she\nsaid suddenly:\n\n\"What about those papers? Have you found anything yet?\" It was only then\nI bethought me of the letter in my pocket. Without a word I took it out\nand handed it to her. There was a slight blush as well as a smile on her\nface as she took it. When she saw the date she said impulsively:\n\n\"Why did I not get it before?\"\n\n\"Because I had not got your address, and did not know how to reach you.\"\n\n\"I see!\" she answered abstractedly as she began to read. When she had\ngone right through it she handed it to me and said:\n\n\"Now you read it out loud to me whilst I paint; and let me ask questions\nso that I may understand.\" So I read; and now and again she asked\nme searching questions. Twice or three times I had to read over the\nmemorandum; but each time she began to understand better and better, and\nat last said eagerly:\n\n\"Have you ever worked out such reductions?\"\n\n\"Not yet, but I could do so. I have been so busy trying to decipher the\nsecret writing that I have not had time to try any such writing myself.\"\n\n\"Have you succeeded in any way?\"\n\n\"No!\" I answered. \"I am sorry to say that as yet I have nothing\ndefinite; though I am bound to say I am satisfied that there is a\ncipher.\"\n\n\"Have you tried both the numbers and the dots?\"\n\n\"Both,\" I answered; \"but as yet I want a jumping-off place.\"\n\n\"Do you really think from what you have studied that the cipher is a\nbiliteral one, or on the basis of a biliteral cipher?\"\n\n\"I do! I can't say exactly how I came to think so; but I certainly do.\"\n\n\"Are there combinations of five?\"\n\n\"Not that I can see.\"\n\n\"Are there combinations of less than five?\"\n\n\"There may be. There are certainly.\"\n\n\"Then why on earth don't you begin by reducing the biliteral cipher to\nthe lowest dimensions you can manage? You may light on something that\nway.\"\n\nA light began to dawn upon me, and I determined that my task--so soon as\nmy friends had left Cruden--would be to reduce Bacon's biliteral. It was\nwith genuine admiration for her suggestion that I answered Miss Anita:\n\n\"Your woman's intuition is quicker than my man's ratiocination. 'I shall\nin all my best obey you, Madam!'\" She painted away steadily for some\ntime. I was looking at her, covertly but steadily when an odd flash of\nmemory came to me; without thinking I spoke:\n\n\"When I first saw you, as you and Mrs. Jack stood on the rock, and away\nbeyond you the rocks were all fringed with foam, your head looked as\nif it was decked with flowers.\" For a moment or two she paused before\nasking:\n\n\"What kind of flowers?\"\n\nOnce again in our brief acquaintance I stood on guard. There was\nsomething in her voice which made me pause. It made my brain whirl, too,\nbut there was a note of warning. At this time, God knows, I did not want\nany spurring. I was head over heels in love with the girl, and my only\nfear was lest by precipitancy I should spoil it all. Not for the wide\nworld would I have cancelled the hopes that were dawning in me and\nfilling me with a feverish anxiety. I could not help a sort of satisfied\nfeeling as I answered:\n\n\"White flowers!\"\n\n\"Oh!\" she said impulsively, and then with a blush continued, painting\nhard as she spoke:\n\n\"That is what they put on the dead! I see!\" This was a counter-stroke\nwith a vengeance. It would not do to let it pass so I added:\n\n\"There is another 'first-column' function also in which white flowers\nare used. Besides, they don't put flowers on the head of corpses.\"\n\n\"Of whom then?\" The note of warning sounded again in the meekness of the\nvoice. But I did not heed it. I did not want to heed it. I answered:\n\n\"Of Brides!\" She made no reply--in words. She simply raised her eyes and\nsent one flashing glance through me, and then went on with her work.\nThat glance was to a certain degree encouragement; but it was to a much\ngreater degree dangerous, for it was full of warning. Although my brain\nwas whirling, I kept my head and let her change the conversation with\nwhat meekness I could.\n\nWe accordingly went back to the cipher. She asked me many questions, and\nI promised to show her the secret writings when we should go back to the\nhotel. Here she struck in:\n\n\"We have ordered dinner at the hotel; and you are to dine with us.\" I\ntried not to tremble as I answered:\n\n\"I shall be delighted.\"\n\n\"And now,\" she said \"if we are to have lunch here to-day we had better\ngo and wake Mrs. Jack. See! the tide has been rising all the time we\nhave been talking. It is time to feed the animals.\"\n\nMrs. Jack was surprised when we wakened her; but she too was ready for\nlunch. We enjoyed the meal hugely.\n\nAt half-tide the Hay boys came back. Miss Anita thought that there was\nenough work for them both in carrying the basket and helping Mrs. Jack\nback to the carriage. \"You will be able to row all right, will you not?\"\nshe said, turning to me. \"You know the way now and can steer. I shall\nnot be afraid!\"\n\nWhen we were well out beyond the rock and could see the figures of Mrs.\nJack and the boys getting further away each step, I took my courage in\nboth hands; I was getting reckless now, and said to her:\n\n\"When a man is very anxious about a thing, and is afraid that just for\nomitting to say what he would like to say, he may lose something that he\nwould give all the rest of the world to have a chance of getting--do--do\nyou think he should remain silent?\" I could see that she, too, could\nrealise a note of warning. There was a primness and a want of the usual\nreality in her voice as she answered me:\n\n\"Silence, they say, is golden.\" I laughed with a dash of bitterness\nwhich I could not help feeling as I replied:\n\n\"Then in this world the gold of true happiness is only for the dumb!\"\nshe said nothing but looked out with a sort of steadfast introspective\neagerness over the million flashing diamonds of the sea; I rowed on with\nall my strength, glad to let go on something. Presently she turned to\nme, and with all the lambency of her spirit in her face, said with a\nsweetness which tingled through me:\n\n\"Are you not rowing too hard? You seem anxious to get to Whinnyfold. I\nfear we shall be there too soon. There is no hurry; we shall meet the\nothers there in good time. Had you not better keep outside the dangerous\nrocks. There is not a sail in sight; not one, so far as I know, over the\nwhole horizon, so you need not fear any collision. Remember, I do not\nadvise you to cease rowing; for, after all, the current may bear us\naway if we are merely passive. But row easily; and we may reach the\nharbour safely and in good time!\"\n\nHer speech filled me with a flood of feeling which has no name. It was\nnot love; it was not respect; it was not worship; it was not, gratitude.\nBut it was compounded of them all. I had been of late studying secret\nwriting so earnestly that there was now a possible secret meaning in\neverything I read. But oh! the poverty of written words beside the\ngracious richness of speech! No man who had a heart to feel or a brain\nto understand could have mistaken her meaning. She gave warning, and\nhope, and courage, and advice; all that wife could give husband, or\nfriend give friend. I only looked at her, and without a word held out my\nhand. She placed hers in it frankly; for a brief, blissful moment my\nsoul was at one with the brightness of sea and sky.\n\nThere, in the very spot where I had seen Lauchlane Macleod go down into\nthe deep, my own life took a new being.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nIN THE TWILIGHT\n\n\nIt was not without misgiving that I climbed the steep zigzag at\nWhinnyfold, for at every turn I half expected to see the unwelcome face\nof Gormala before me. It seemed hardly possible that everything could\ngo on so well with me, and that yet I should not be disturbed by her\npresence. Miss Anita, I think, saw my uneasiness and guessed the cause\nof it; I saw her follow my glances round, and then she too kept an eager\nlook out. We won the top, however, and got into the waiting carriage\nwithout mishap. At the hotel she asked me to bring to their sitting-room\nthe papers with the secret writing. She gave a whispered explanation\nthat we should be quite alone as Mrs. Jack always took a nap, when\npossible, before dinner.\n\nShe puzzled long and anxiously over the papers and over my enlarged part\ncopy of them. Finally she shook her head and gave it up for the time.\nThen I told her the chief of the surmises which I had made regarding the\nmeans by which the biliteral cipher, did such exist, might be expressed.\nThat it must be by marks of some sort was evident; but which of those\nused were applied to this purpose I could not yet make out. When I had\nexhausted my stock of surmises she said:\n\n\"More than ever I am convinced that you must begin by reducing the\nbiliteral cipher. Every time I think of it, it seems plainer to me that\nBacon, or any one else using such a system, would naturally perfect it\nif possible. And now let us forget this for the present. I am sure you\nmust want a rest from thinking of the cipher, and I feel that I do.\nDinner is ready; after it, if you will, I should like another run down\nto the beach.\"\n\n\"_Another_\" run to the beach! then she remembered our former one as a\nsort of fixed point. My heart swelled within me, and my resolution to\ntake my own course, even if it were an unwise one, grew.\n\nAfter dinner, we took our way over the sandhills and along the shore\ntowards the Hawklaw, keeping on the line of hard sand just below\nhigh-water mark.\n\nThe sun was down and the twilight was now beginning. In these northern\nlatitudes twilight is long, and at the beginning differs little from the\nfull light of day. There is a mellowed softness over everything, and all\nis grey in earth and sea and air. Light, however, there is in abundance\nat the first. The mystery of twilight, as Southerns know it, comes later\non, when the night comes creeping up from over the sea, and the shadows\nwiden into gloom. Still twilight is twilight in any degree of its\nchanging existence; and the sentiment of twilight is the same all the\nworld over. It is a time of itself; between the stress and caution of\nthe day, and the silent oblivion of the night: It is an hour when all\nliving things, beasts as well as human, confine themselves to their own\nbusiness. With the easy relaxation comes something of self-surrender;\nsoul leans to soul and mind to mind, as does body to body in moments of\nlarger and more complete intention. Just as in the moment after sunset,\nwhen the earth is lit not by the narrow disc of the sun but by the\nglory of the wide heavens above, twin shadows merge into one, so in the\ntwilight two natures which are akin come closer to the identity of one.\nBetween daylight and dark as the myriad sounds of life die away one by\none, the chirp of birds, the lowing of cattle, the bleating of sheep,\nthe barking of dogs, so do the natural sounds such as the rustle of\ntrees, the plash of falling water, or the roar of breaking waves wake\ninto a new force that strikes on the ear with a sense of intention or\nconscious power. It is as though in all the wide circle of nature's\nmight there is never to be such a thing as stagnation; no moment of\npoise, save when the spirits of nature proclaim abnormal silence, such\nas ruled when earth stood \"at gaze, like Joshua's moon on Ajalon.\"\n\nThe spirits of my companion and myself yielded to this silent influence\nof the coming night. Unconsciously we walked close together and in step;\nand were silent, wrapt in the beauty around us. To me it was a gentle\necstasy. To be alone with her in such a way, in such a place, was the\ngood of all heaven and all earth in one. And so for many minutes we went\nslowly on our way along the deserted sand, and in hearing of the music\nof the sounding sea and the echoing shore.\n\nBut even Heaven had its revolt. It seems that whether it be on Earth or\nin Heaven intelligence is not content to remain in a condition of poise.\nEver there are heights to be won. Out of my own very happiness and the\npeace that it gave me, came afresh the wild desire to scale new heights\nand to make the present altitude which I had achieved a stepping-off\nplace for a loftier height. All arguments seemed to crowd in my mind to\nprove that I was justified in asking Marjory to be my wife. Other men\nhad asked women whom they had known but a short time to marry them; and\nwith happy result. It was apparent that at the least she did not dislike\nme. I was a gentleman, of fair stock, and well-to-do; I could offer her\na true and a whole heart. She, who was seemingly only companion to a\nwealthy woman, could not be offended at a man's offering to her all\nhe had to give. I had already approached the subject, and she had not\nwarned me off it; she had only given me in a sweetly artful way advice\nin which hope held a distinct place. Above all, the days and hours and\nmoments were flying by. I did not know her address or when I should see\nher again, or if at all. This latest thought decided me. I would speak\nplainly to-night.\n\nOh, but men are dull beside women in the way of intuition. This girl\nseemed to be looking over the sea, and yet with some kind of double\nglance, such as women have at command, she seemed to have been all the\ntime looking straight through and through me and getting some idea\nof her own from my changing expression. I suppose the appearance of\ndetermination frightened her or set her on guard, for she suddenly said:\n\n\"Ought we not to be turning home?\"\n\n\"Not yet!\" I pleaded, all awake in a moment from my dreams. \"A few\nminutes, and then we can go back.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" she said with a smile, and then added demurely; \"we must\nnot be long.\" I felt that my hour had come and spoke impulsively:\n\n\"Marjory, will you be my wife?\" Having got out the words I stopped. My\nheart was beating so heavily that I could not speak more. For a few\nseconds, which seemed ages to me, we were both silent. I daresay that\nshe may have been prepared for something; from what I know now I am\nsatisfied that her own intention was to ward off any coming difficulty.\nBut the suddenness and boldness of the question surprised her and\nembarrassed her to silence. She stopped walking, and as she stood still\nI could see her bosom heave--like my own. Then with a great effort,\nwhich involved a long breath and the pulling up of her figure and the\nsetting back of her shoulders, she spoke:\n\n\"But you know nothing of me!\"\n\n\"I know all of you that I want to know!\" This truly Hibernian speech\namused her, even through her manifest emotion and awkwardness, if one\ncan apply the word to one compact of so many graces. I saw the smile,\nand it seemed to set us both more at ease.\n\n\"That sounds very rude,\" she said \"but I understand what you mean, and\ntake it so.\" This gave me an opening into which I jumped at once. She\nlistened, seeming not displeased at my words; but on the whole glad of a\nmoment's pause to collect her thoughts before again speaking:\n\n\"I know that you are beautiful; the most beautiful and graceful girl I\never saw. I know that you are brave and sweet and tender and thoughtful.\nI know that you are clever and resourceful and tactful. I know that you\nare a good comrade; that you are an artist with a poet's soul. I know\nthat you are the one woman in all the wide world for me; that having\nseen you there can never be any one else to take your place in my heart.\nI know that I would rather die with you in my arms, than live a king\nwith any other queen!\"\n\n\"But you have only seen me twice. How can you know so many nice things\nabout me. I wish they were all true! I am only a girl; and I must say it\nis sweet to hear them, whether they be true or not. Anyhow, supposing\nthem all true, how could you have known them?\"\n\nHope was stepping beside me now. I went on:\n\n\"I did not need a second meeting to know so much. To-day was but a\nrepetition of my joy; an endorsement of my judgment; a fresh rivetting\nof my fetters!\" She smiled in spite of herself as she replied:\n\n\"You leave me dumb. How can I answer or argue with such a conviction.\"\nThen she laid her hand tenderly on my arm as she went on:\n\n\"Oh, I know what you mean, my friend. I take it all in simple truth; and\nbelieve me it makes me proud to hear it, though it also makes me feel\nsomewhat unworthy of so much faith. But there is one other thing which\nyou must consider. In justice to me you must.\" She paused and I felt my\nheart grow cold. \"What is it?\" I asked. I tried to speak naturally but I\nfelt that my voice was hoarse. Her answer came slowly, but it seemed to\nturn me to ice:\n\n\"But I don't know you!\"\n\nThere was a pity in her eyes which gave me some comfort, though not\nmuch; a man whose soul is crying out for love does not want pity.\nLove is a glorious self-surrender; all spontaneity; all gladness, all\nsatisfaction, in which doubt and forethought have no part. Pity is a\nconscious act of the mind; wherein is a knowledge of one's own security\nof foothold. The two can no more mingle than water and oil.\n\nThe shock had come, and I braced myself to it. I felt that now if ever\nI should do my devoir as a gentleman. It was my duty as well as my\nprivilege to shield this woman from unnecessary pain and humiliation.\nWell I knew, that it had been pain to her to say such a thing to me; and\nthe pain had come from my own selfish impulse. She had warned me earlier\nin the day, and I had broken through her warning. Now she was put in\na false position through my act; it was necessary I should make her\nfeelings as little painful as I could. I had even then a sort of dim\nidea that my best plan would have been to have taken her in my arms and\nkissed her. Had we both been older I might have done so; but my love was\nnot built in this fashion. Passion was so mingled with respect that the\nother course, recognition of, and obedience to, her wishes seemed all\nthat was open to me. Besides it flashed across me that she might take it\nthat I was presuming on her own impulsive act on the rock. I said with\nwhat good heart I could:\n\n\"That is an argument unanswerable, at present. I can only hope that time\nwill stand my friend. Only\" I added and my voice choked as I said it\n\"Do, do believe that I am in deadly earnest; that all my life is at\nstake; and that I only wait, and I will wait loyally with what patience\nI can, in obedience to your will. My feelings and my wish, and--and my\nrequest will stand unaltered till I die!\" She said not a word, but the\ntears rose up in her beautiful eyes and ran down her blushing cheeks as\nshe held out her hand to me. She did not object when I raised it to my\nlips and kissed it with all my soul in the kiss!\n\nWe turned instinctively and walked homewards. I felt dejected, but not\nbroken. At first the sand seemed to be heavy to my feet; but when after\na little I noticed that my companion walked with a buoyancy unusual even\nto her, I too became gay again. We came back to the hotel much in the\nspirit in which we had set out.\n\nWe found Mrs. Jack dressed, all but her outer cloak, and ready for the\nroad. She went away with Marjory to finish her toilet, but came back\nbefore her younger companion. When we were alone she said to me after a\nfew moments of 'hum'ing and 'ha'ing and awkward preparation of speech:\n\n\"Oh Mr. Hunter, Marjory tells me that she intends to ride on her bicycle\ndown to Aberdeen from Braemar where we are going on Friday. I am to\ndrive from Braemar to Ballater and then go on by train so that I shall\nbe in before her, though I am to leave later. But I am fearful about the\ngirl riding such a journey by herself. We have no gentleman friend here,\nand it would be so good of you to take charge of her, if you happened\nto be anywhere about there. I know I can trust you to take care of her,\nyou have been so good to her, and to me, already.\"\n\nMy heart leaped. Here was an unexpected chance come my way. Time was\nshowing himself to be my friend already.\n\n\"Be quite assured,\" I said as calmly as I could \"I shall be truly glad\nto be of the least service. And indeed it will just suit my plans, as I\nhoped to go to Braemar on my bicycle one day very soon and can arrange\nto go just as may suit you. But of course you understand that I must not\ngo unless Miss Anita wishes it. I could not presume to thrust myself\nupon her.\"\n\n\"Oh that is all right!\" she answered quickly, so quickly that I took it\nthat she had already considered the matter and was satisfied about it.\n\"Marjory will not object.\" Just then the young lady entered the room and\nMrs. Jack turning to her said:\n\n\"I have asked Mr. Hunter my dear to ride down with you from Braemar; and\nhe says that as it just suits his plans as he was going there he will be\nvery happy if you ask him.\" She smiled as she said:\n\n\"Oh since you asked him and he had said yes I need not ask him too; but\nI shall be very glad!\" I bowed. When Mrs. Jack went out, Marjory turning\nto me said:\n\n\"When did you plan to go to Braemar?\"\n\n\"When Mrs. Jack told me you were going\" I answered boldly.\n\n\"Oh! I didn't mean that,\" she said with a slight blush \"but at what time\nyou were to be there.\" To which I said:\n\n\"That will be just to suit your convenience. Will you write and let me\nknow?\" She saw through my ruse of getting a letter, and smilingly held\nup a warning finger.\n\nAs we strolled up the road, waiting for the dog-cart to be got ready,\nshe said to me:\n\n\"Now you can be a good comrade I know; and you said that, amongst other\nthings, I was a good comrade. So I am; and between Braemar and Aberdeen\nwe must both be good comrades. That and nothing more! Whatever may come\nafter, for good or ill, that time must be kept apart.\"\n\n\"Agreed!\" I said and felt a secret exultation as we joined Mrs. Jack.\nBefore they started Marjory said:\n\n\"Mrs. Jack I also have asked Mr. Hunter to come on the ride from\nBraemar. I thought it would please him if we both asked him, since he is\nso diffident and unimpulsive!\"\n\nWith a smile she said good-bye and waved it with her whip as they\nstarted.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nTHE CIPHER\n\n\nI went straight to my own room and commenced to work afresh on the\nbiliteral cipher. More than ever had I the conviction upon me that the\nreading of the secret writing would be the first step to the attainment\nof my wishes regarding Marjory. It would have been strange therefore if\nI had not first attempted the method which she had herself suggested,\nthe reducing the Baconian cipher to its lowest elements.\n\nFor many hours I laboured at this work, and finally when I had reduced\nthe Baconian five symbols to three I felt that I had accomplished all\nthat was possible in that way.[2]\n\n      [2] See Appendix B.\n\nWhen I had arrived at this result, and had tested its accuracy in\nworking, I felt in a position to experiment with my new knowledge on the\nold number cipher. First I wrote out my method of reduction as a sort of\naddendum to the paper which I had prepared for Marjory. Then I made a\nkey to cipher and one to de-cipher.[3] By this time the night was well\non and the grey of early morning was beginning to steal in by the edges\nof the blinds; I was not sleepy, however; I was too much excited to\nthink of sleep, for the solving of the problem seemed almost within my\ngrasp. Excited to a state which almost frightened me by its intensity, I\ngot ready my copy of the number cipher and my newly prepared key. With\nan effort which took me all my resolution I went on steadily writing\nits proper letter under each combination without once looking back; for\nI knew that even should some of the letters be misplaced in the key\nthe chance of recognising the right ones would be largely increased by\nseeing a considerable number of letters together.\n\n      [3] See Appendix C.\n\nThen I glanced over the whole and found that many of the symbols made up\nletters. With such a basis to work on, the rest was only labour. A few\ntentative efforts and I had corrected the key to agreement with some of\nthe combinations in the cipher.\n\nI found, however, that only here and there were letters revealed; try\nhow I would, I could not piece out the intervening symbols. At last it\noccurred to me that there might be in the paper two or more ciphers. On\ntrying to follow out the idea, it became apparent that there were at\nleast a quantity of impeding numbers scattered through the cipher. These\nmight be only put in to baffle pursuit, as I had surmised might be done\nwhen I made the cipher; or they might have a more definite purpose. At\nany rate they hampered my work, so I struck them out as I went along.\nThat I continued till I had exhausted the whole list of numbers in the\nscript.\n\nWhen I looked back over the letters translated from the cipher thus\ndepleted, I found to my inexpressible joy that the sequence and sense\nwere almost complete. The translation read as follows:\n\n\"To read the history of the Trust use cipher of Fr. Bacon. The senses\nand the figures are less worthy than the Trinity B. de E.\"\n\nOne step more and my work was done. I set the discarded numbers in\nsequence on another sheet of paper, and found to my intense satisfaction\nthey formed an inner record readable by the same key. The \"encloased\"\nwords, to use Bacon's phrase, were:\n\n\"Treasure Cave cliff one and half degree Northe of East from outer\nrock.\"\n\nThen and then only did I feel tired. The sun was well up but I tumbled\ninto bed and was asleep in a moment.\n\nThe gong was sounding for breakfast when I awoke. After breakfast when\nI resumed my work I set myself to construct a variant of my number key\nto suit the dotted letters, for my best chance, now that I was on the\ntrack was to construct rather than to decipher. After some hard work I\nat last constructed a cipher on this plan.[4]\n\n      [4] See Appendix D.\n\nI then began therefore to apply my new key to the copy of the cipher in\nthe printed pages.\n\nI worked steadily and completed the whole of the first page, writing\ndown only the answer to those combinations which fitted into my scheme,\nand leaving all doubtful matters blank. Then I laid aside my key, and\nwith a beating heart glanced over the result.\n\nIt more than satisfied me, for in the scattered letters though there\nwere many blanks, was manifestly a connected narrative. Then I took the\nblanks and worked at them altering my key to suit the scheme of the\noriginal writer, till by slow degrees I had mastered the secret of the\ncipher construction.\n\nFrom that hour on, till I had translated the cipher writing from\nbeginning to end I knew no rest that I could avoid. I had to take my\nmeals, and to snatch a few hours of sleep now and again; for the labour\nof translation was very arduous and slow, and the strain on my eyes\nwas too great to be kept up continuously; with each hour, however, I\nacquired greater facility in the work. It was the evening of the fourth\nday, however, before my work was complete. I was then absolute master\nof the writer's intent.\n\nAll this time I had not heard from Marjory, and this alone made\nexcessive work a necessary anodyne. Had I not had the long and\noverwhelming preoccupation to keep my mind from dwelling on the never\nending disappointment, I do not know what I should have done. I fully\nexpected a letter by the last post that night. I knew Marjory was\nstaying somewhere in the County; it was by that post that we received\nlocal letters. None came, however, and that night I spent in making a\nfair transcript of the whole translation.\n\nThe first part of it was in the shape of a letter, and ran as follows:\n\n  \"My deare Sonne, These from the towne of Aberdeyne in Scotland\n  wherin I lie sick, and before I go on my quest for the fullfillment\n  of my Trust. I have written, from time to time during my long\n  sickness, a full narrative of what has been; so that you may know\n  all as though your own ears had heard and your own eyes had seen.\n  All that I have written is to the one end--that you my eldest sonne\n  and the rest of my children, may, should I fail--and I am weak in\n  bodie to so strive--carry on the Trust to which I have pledged you\n  as well as myself; so that untill that Trust be yielded up complete,\n  neither I nor you nor they are free to any that may clash with the\n  purpose to which our race is henceforth now devoted. But that mine\n  oath may not press overhard on my children, and if need be on their\n  children and their children's children to the end, it will suffice\n  if one alone at all times shall hold himself or herself pledged to\n  the fullfillment of the Trust. To this end I charge herewith all of\n  my blood and race that the eldest sonne of each generation do hold\n  himself pledged to the purpose of the Trust, unless some other of\n  the direct lineage do undertake it on his behalf. In default of\n  which, or if such undertaken Trust shall fail, then the duty\n  reverteth back and back till one be found whose duty it is by\n  priority of inheritance, unless by some other of the direct lineage\n  the Trust be undertaken on his behalf. And be mindful one and all to\n  whom is this sacred duty that secrecy is of its very essence. The\n  great Trust was to me in the first instance in that His Holiness\n  Pope Sixtus Fifth and my good kinsman known as the Spanish Cardinal\n  held graciouslly that I was one in whose heart the ancient honour of\n  our dear Spain had a place of lodgement so secure that time alone\n  could not efface it nor its continuance in the hearts of my\n  children. To the purpose then of this great Trust His Holiness hath\n  himself given to me and mine full powers of all kinds so to deal\n  with such circumstances as may arise that the labour which we have\n  undertaken may in all cases be brought to a successful issue. To the\n  which His Holiness hath formulated a Quittance which shall be\n  co-existent with the Trust and which shall purge the natural sin of\n  any to whom in the discharge of the duties of the Trust any\n  necessity may arise. But inasmuch as the Trust is a secret one and\n  the undue publication of such Quittance might call the attention of\n  the curious to its existence, such Document is filed in the secret\n  record of the Vatican, where, should necessity hereafter arise, it\n  may be found by the Holy Father who may then occupy the Chair of St.\n  Peter on application made to him on behalf of any who may so offend\n  against law or the rules of well-being which govern the children of\n  Christ. And I charge you, oh! my sonne to ever bear in mind that\n  though there be some strange things in the narrative they are in\n  mine own eyes true in all ways, though it may appear to you that\n  they accord not with what may be said hereafter of these time's by\n  other men.\n\n  \"And oh, my sonne, and my children all, take this my last blessing\n  and with it my counsel that ye walk always in Faith and\n  Righteousness, in Honour and in Good Report, with your duty ever to\n  Holy Church and to the King in loyal service. Farewell! God and the\n  Blessed Virgin and the Saintes and Angels watch over you and help\n  you that your duty be done.\n\n  \"Your father in all love,\n  \"BERNARDINO DE ESCOBAN.\"\n\n  \"These will be brought by a trusty hand, for I fear lest they shall\n  fall into the hands of the English Queene, or any of her hereticall\n  surroundings. If it be that you fail at the first in the speedy\n  fullfillment of the Trust--as may be, now that the purpose of our\n  great Armada hath been checked--it may be well that whoso to whom\n  is the Trust may come hither and dwell upon these shores so that he\n  may watch over the purpose of the Trust and be at hand for its\n  fullfillment when occasion may serve. But be mindful ever, oh my\n  sonne, that who so guardeth the Trust will be ever surrounded by\n  enemies, heathenish and without remorse, whose greed should it ever\n  be awakened to this purpose would be fatal to all which we cherish.\n  Dixi.\"\n\nFollowing this came:\n\n  \"Narrative of Bernardino de Escoban, Knight of the Cross of the Holy\n  See and Grandee of Spain.\n\n  In this was set out at full length[5] the history of the great\n  Treasure gathered by Pope Sixtus Fifth for the subjugation of\n  England, and which he entrusted to the writer of the narrative who\n  had at his own cost built and manned one of the vessels of the\n  Armada the _San Cristobal_ flagship of the Squadron of the Galleons\n  of Castile. The Pope, wearied by the demands of Philip of Spain and\n  offended by his claim to appoint bishops under the new domain and\n  further incensed by the incautious insolence of Count de Olivares\n  the Spanish ambassador to Rome, has chosen to make this a secret\n  trust and has on the suggestion of the Spanish Cardinal chosen Don\n  Bernardino de Escoban for the service. In furtherance of his design\n  he has sent him for his new galleon a \"figurehead\" wrought in\n  silver and gold for his own galley by Benvenuto Cellini. Also he\n  has given him as a souvenir a brooch wrought by the same\n  master-hand, the figurehead wrought _in petto_. Don Bernardino\n  gives account of the defeat of the Armada and tells how his vessel\n  being crippled and he being fearful of the seizure of the treasure\n  entrusted to him buries it and the coveted figurehead in a water\n  cave at the headland of a bay on the coast of Aberdeyne. He has\n  blown up the opening of the cave for safety. In the narrative were\n  certain enlightening phrases such as when the Pope says:\n\n      [5] See Appendix E.\n\n\"'To which end I am placing with you a vastness of treasure such as no\nnation hath ever seen.\" Which was to be applied to only the advancement\nof the True Faith, and which was in case of failure of the enterprise of\nthe Armada to be given to the custody of whatever King should, after the\ndeath of Sixtus V, sit upon the throne. And again:\n\n\"'The Cave was a great one on the south side of the Bay with many\nwindings and blind offsets.... 'The black stone on one hand and the red\non the other giving back the blare of the lantern.'\"\n\nThe memoranda which follow give the future history of the Trust:\n\n  \"The narrative of my father, the great and good Don Bernardino de\n  Escoban, I have put in the present form for the preservation of the\n  secret. For inasmuch as the chart to which he has alluded is not to\n  be found, though other papers and charts there be, it may be\n  necessary that a branch of our house may live in this country in\n  obedience to the provision of the Trust and so must learn to speak\n  the English as though it were the mother tongue. As I was but a\n  youth when my father wrote, so many years have elapsed that death\n  has wrought many changes and the hand that should have carried the\n  message and given me the papers and the chart is no more, lying as\n  is thought beside my father amongst the surges of the Skyres. So\n  that only a brief note pointing to the contents of an oaken chest\n  wherein I found them, though incomplete, was all that I had to guide\n  me. The tongue that might have spoken some added words of import was\n  silent for ever\n\n  \"FRANCISCO DE ESCOBAN.\"\n  \"23, October, 1599.\"\n\n\n  \"The narrative of my grandfather, together with my father's note\n  have I Englished faithfully and put in this secret form for the\n  guidance of those who may follow me, and whose life must be passed\n  in this rigorous clime untill the sacred Trust committed to us by\n  Pope Sixtus the Fifth be fullfilled. When on the death of my elder\n  brother, I being but the second son, I was sent to join my father\n  in Aberdeyne, I made grave preparation for bearing worthily the\n  burden laid upon us by the Trust and so schooled myself in the\n  English that it is now as my mother tongue. Then when my father,\n  having completed the building of his castle, set himself to the\n  finding of the cave whereof the secret was lost, in which emprise\n  he, like my grandfather lost his life amongst the waters of the\n  Skyres of Crudene. Ye that may follow me in the trust regard well\n  this secret writing, made for the confusion of the curious but to\n  the preservation of our secret. Bear ever in mind that not all that\n  is shows on the surface of even simple words. The cipher of my\n  Grandfather devised by Fr. Bacon now High Chancellor of England has\n  many mouths, all of which may speak if there be aught to say.\n\n  \"BERNARDINO DE ESCOBAN.\"\n  \"4, July, 1620.\"\n\n\nIn addition to the cipher narrative I found on close examination that\nthere was a separate cipher running through the marginal notes on the\nearlier of the printed pages. When translated it ran as follows:\n\n  \"Cave mouthe northe of outer rock one degree and half North of East.\n  Reef lies from shore point three and half degrees South of South\n  East.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\nA RIDE THROUGH THE MOUNTAINS\n\n\nI read Don Escoban's narrative over and over again, till I had\nthoroughly mastered every detail of it; then I studied the key of the\nnumber cipher till I had it by heart. I had an instinct that memory\non this subject would be a help and a safety to me now or hereafter.\nFor now new doubts had begun to assail me. What I had learned was in\nreality a State secret and had possible consequences or eventualities\nwhich, despite the lapse of three centuries, might prove far-reaching\nand dangerous. The treasure in question was so vast, its purpose so\ndefinite, and its guardianship so jealously protected against time and\naccident, that there was but little chance of forgetfulness regarding\nit. I was not assailed by moral scruples in any way. The treasure had\nbeen amassed and dedicated to the undoing of England; and for those\nwho had gathered it and sent it forth I had no concern. That it had\nbeen hidden in Britain by Britain's enemies during time of war surely\ndeprived them of all right to recover by legal means. What the law might\nbe on the subject I did not know, and till I knew I cared little. It was\na case of \"finders keepers,\" and if I could find it first I held myself\njustified in using it to my own purposes. All the same I made up my mind\nto look up the law of Treasure Trove, which I had a hazy idea was in a\npretty uncertain condition. At first none of these issues troubled me.\nThey were indeed side issues till the treasure should be found; when\nthey would become of prime importance. I had felt that my first step to\nwinning the hand of Marjory Anita was to read the cipher. This I had\ndone; and in the doing had made discovery of a secret of such a nature\nthat it might place me beyond the dreams of avarice, and in a position\nto ask any girl in the world to marry me. I believe that I regarded the\ntreasure as already my own; as much as though I had already recovered it\nfrom the bowels of the earth.\n\nEarly in the morning I took my way to Whinnyfold, bringing with me a\npocket compass so that I could locate the exact spot where the mouth\nof the cave had been closed. I knew of course that even granite rocks\ncannot withstand untouched the beating of three centuries of stormy sea,\nthe waste of three hundred summers and winters, and the thousands of\nnights of bitter frost and days of burning sun which had come to pass\nsince the entrance of the cave had been so rudely shaken down. But I\nwas, I confess, not prepared for the utter annihilation which had come\nto every trace of its whereabouts. Time after time the sea had bitten\ninto the land; and falling rocks, and creeping verdure, and drifting\nsand had changed the sea-front beyond all recognition.\n\nI did what I could, however, to take the bearings of the place as laid\ndown by Don de Escoban by walking along the top of the cliff, beginning\nat the very edge of Witsennan Point till I reached a spot where the\nsouth end of the outer rock of the Skares stood out.\n\nThen to my surprise I found that it was as near as possible in the\ndirection of my own house. In fact when I looked at the plan which the\nlocal surveyor had made of my house I found that the northern wall made\na bee line for the south end of the main rock of the Skares. As it was\nmanifest that what had originally been the front of the cave had fallen\nin and been partly worn and worked away, my remaining hope was that the\ncave itself lay under part of my ground if not under the house itself.\nThis gave a new feature to the whole affair. If my surmise were correct\nI need not hurry at all; the safest thing I could do would be to quietly\nmake an opening from my house into the cave, and explore at leisure. All\nseemed clear for this proceeding. The workmen who had done the building\nwere gone, and the coming of the decorators had not yet been fixed. I\ncould therefore have the house to myself. As I went back to the hotel, I\nplanned out in my mind how I should get from Glasgow or Aberdeen proper\nimplements for digging and cutting through the rock into the house;\nthese would be sent in cases, so that no one would suspect what I was\nundertaking. The work would have to be done by myself if I wished to\npreserve secrecy. I had now so much to tell Marjory when we should meet\nthat I felt I should hardly know where to begin, and the business side\nof my mind began to plan and arrange so that all things might come in\ndue order and to the best effect.\n\nWhen I got to the hotel I found awaiting me a letter from Marjory which\nhad come by the last post. I took it away to my room and locked the door\nbefore opening it. It had neither address nor date, and was decidedly\ncharacteristic:\n\n  \"My dear Sir: Mrs. Jack asks me to write for her to say that we\n  shall be leaving Braemar on Tuesday. We shall be staying at the Fife\n  Arms Hotel, and she will be very happy if you will breakfast with us\n  at nine o'clock A.\u00c2\u00a0M. Room No. 16. This is all of course in case you\n  care to ride down to Aberdeen. We are breakfasting so early as the\n  ride is long, sixty miles, and Mrs. Jack thinks that I should have\n  a rest at least twice on the way. As I believe you know the road,\n  she will be glad if you will kindly arrange our stopping places.\n  Mrs. Jack will leave Braemar at about three o'clock and drive down\n  to Ballater to catch the half-past five train. She asks me to say\n  that she hopes you will pardon her for the trouble she is giving\n  you, and to impress on you that in case you would rather not come,\n  or should anything occur to prevent you, she will quite understand a\n  telegram with the single word 'regret.' By the way she will be\n  obliged if you will kindly not mention her name--either her surname\n  or her Christian name--before any of the people--strangers or hotel\n  people, at Braemar or during the journey--or indeed during the day.\n  Believe me,\n\n  Yours very truly,\n  \"MARJORY ANITA.\"\n\n  \"P.S.--How about the cipher; have you reduced the biliteral, or got\n  any clue yet?\n\n  \"P.P.S.--I don't suppose that anything, unless it be really\n  serious, will prevent your coming. Mrs. Jack is so looking forward\n  to my having that bicycle ride.\n\n  \"P.P.P.S.--Have you second-sighted any ships yet? Or any more white\n  flowers--for the Dead?\"\n\nFor long I sat with the letter in my hand after I had read it over and\nover again many many times. Each time I read it its purpose seemed more\nluminous. It may have been that my old habit of a year ago of finding\nsecret meanings in everything was creeping back to me. I thought and\nthought; and the introspective habit made me reason out causes even in\nthe midst of imaginative flights. \"Might not\" I thought \"it be possible\nthat there be minor forms of Second Sight; Day Dreams based on some\ngreat effort of truth. In the real world there are manifestations of\nlife in lower as well as higher forms; and yet all alike are instinct\nwith some of that higher principle which divides the quick and the dead.\nThe secret voices of the brain need not always speak in thunder; the\nDream-Painter within us need not always have a full canvas for the\nexercise of his craft.\"\n\nOn Tuesday morning when at nine o'clock to the minute I went to the Fife\nArms at Braemar, I found Marjory alone. She came forward with a bright,\nfrank smile and shook hands. \"It's real good to see you\" was all she\nsaid. Presently she added:\n\n\"Mrs. Jack will be here in a minute or two. Before she comes, it is\nunderstood that between this and Aberdeen and indeed for to-day, you and\nI are only to be comrades.\"\n\n\"Yes!\" said I, and then added: \"Without prejudice!\" She showed her\npearly teeth in a smile as she answered:\n\n\"All right. Without prejudice! Be it so!\" Then Mrs. Jack came in, and\nhaving greeted me warmly, we sat down to breakfast. When this was over,\nMarjory cut a good packet of sandwiches and tied them up herself. These\nshe handed to me saying:\n\n\"You will not mind carrying these. It will be nicer having our lunch out\nthan going to a hotel; don't you think so?\" Needless to say I cordially\nacquiesced. Both our bicycles were ready at the door, and we lost no\ntime in getting under weigh. Indeed my companion showed some anxiety to\nbe off quickly, as though she wished to avoid observation.\n\nThe day was glorious. There was bright sunshine; and a sky of turquoise\nwith here and there a flock of fleecy clouds. The smart easterly breeze\nswept us along as though we were under sail. The air was cool and the\nroad smooth as asphalt, but with the springiness of well-packed gravel.\nWith the least effort of pedalling we simply seemed to fly. I could see\nthe exhilaration on my companion's face as clearly as I could feel it in\nmy own nature. All was buoyancy, above, below, around us; and I doubt if\nin all the wide circle of the sun's rays there were two such glad hearts\nas Marjory's and my own.\n\nAs we flew along, the lovely scenery on either hand seemed like an\nendless panorama. Of high mountains patched with heather which here and\nthere, early in the year as it was, broke out in delicate patches of\npink; of overarching woods whose creaking branches swaying in the wind\nthrew kaleidoscopic patterns of light along our way; of a brown river\nfed by endless streams rushing over a bed of stones which here and there\nlifted their dark heads through the foam of the brown-white water; of\ngreen fields stretching away on either side of the river or rising\nsteeply from our feet to the fringes of high-lying pines or the black\nmountains which rose just beyond; of endless aisles of forest where,\nthrough the dark shade of the brown trunks, rose from the brown mass\nof long-fallen pine needles which spread the ground below, and where\npatches of sunlight fell in places with a seemingly intolerable glare!\nThen out into the open again where the sunlight seemed all natural and\neven the idea of shade unreal. Down steep hills where the ground seemed\nto slide back underneath our flying wheels, and up lesser hills, swept\nwithout effort by the wind behind us and the swift impetus of our pace.\n\nAfter a while the mountains before us, which at first had seemed like an\nunbroken line of frowning giants barring our course, seemed to open a\nway to us. Round and round we swept, curve after curve yielding and\nfalling back and opening new vistas; till at the last we passed into the\nopen gap between the hills around Ballater. Here in the face of possible\ndanger we began to crawl cautiously down the steep hill to the town.\nMrs. Jack had proposed that we should make our first halt at Ballater.\nAs, however, we put on pace again at the foot of the hill Marjory said:\n\n\"Oh do not let us stop in a town. I could not bear it just after that\nlovely ride through the mountains.\"\n\n\"Agreed!\" I said \"let us push on! That twenty miles seems like nothing.\nBeyond Cambus-o-May there is a lake on the northern side; we can ride\nround it and come back to the road again at Dinnet. If you like we can\nhave our lunch in the shelter of a lovely wood at the far side of it.\"\n\n\"That will be enchanting!\" she said, and the happy girlish freshness of\nher voice was like a strain of music which suited well the scene. When\nwe had passed Ballater and climbed the hill up to the railway bridge we\nstopped to look back; and in sheer delight she caught hold of my arm and\nstood close to me. And no wonder she was moved, for in the world there\ncan be few places of equal beauty of a similar kind. Right above us to\nthe right, and again across the valley, towered mountains of rich brown\nwith patches of purple and lines of green; and in front of us in the\ncentre of the amphitheatre, two round hills, looming large in a delicate\nmist, served as portals to the valley which trended upward between\nthe hills beyond. The road to Braemar seemed like a veritable road of\nmystery, guarded by an enchanted gate. With a sigh we turned our backs\non all this beauty, and skirting the river, ran by Cambus-o-May and\nbetween woods of pine in an opening vista of new loveliness. Eastward\nbefore us lay a mighty sweep of hill and moor, backed on every side by\ngreat mountains which fell away one behind the other into misty distance\nof delicate blue. At our feet far below, lay two spreading lakes of\nsapphire hue, fringed here and there with woods, and dotted with little\nislands whose trees bent down to the water's edge. Marjory stood rapt\nfor awhile, her breast heaving and her face glowing. At last she turned\nto me with a sigh; her beautiful eyes were bright with unshed tears as\nshe said:\n\n\"Oh, was there ever in the world anything so beautiful as this Country!\nAnd was there ever so exquisite a ride as ours to-day!\"\n\nDoes ever a man love a woman more than when she shows herself\nsusceptible to beauty, and is moved to the fulness and simplicity of\nemotion which is denied to his own sex? I thought not, as Marjory and I\nswept down the steep road and skirted by the crystal lakes of Ceander\nand Davan to the wood in which we were to have our _al fresco_ lunch.\nHere, sheltered from the wind, the sunshine seemed too strong to make\nsitting in the open pleasant; and we were glad to have the shade of the\ntrees. As we sat down and I began to unpack the luncheon, Marjory said:\n\n\"And now tell me how you have been getting on with the cipher.\" I stood\nstill for so long that she raised her head and took a sharp glance of\nsurprise at me.\n\nIn the charm of her presence I had absolutely forgotten all about the\ncipher and what might grow from it.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\nA SECRET SHARED\n\n\n\"There is so much to tell\" I said \"that I hardly know where to begin.\nPerhaps I had better tell you all here, where we are alone and not\nlikely to be disturbed. We have come so fast that we have lots of time\nand we need not hurry. When you have had your lunch I shall tell you\nall.\"\n\n\"Oh please don't wait till then,\" she said, \"I am all impatience. Let me\nknow right away.\"\n\n\"Young woman\" I said sternly \"you are at present insincere. You _know_\nyou are ravenously hungry, as you should be after a twenty mile ride;\nand you are speaking according to your idea of convention and not out of\nyour heart. This is not convention; there is nothing conventional in the\nwhole outfit. Eat the food prepared for you by the thoughtfulness of a\nvery beautiful and charming girl!\" She held up a warning finger and\nsaid:\n\n\"Remember '_Bon Camarade_--without prejudice.'\"\n\n\"All right\" I answered \"so it shall be. But if the lady wants to hold me\nup for criminal libel I shall undertake to repeat the expression when,\nand where, and how she will. I shall repeat the assertion and abide by\nthe consequences.\" She went on eating her sandwiches, not, I thought,\ndispleased. When we had both finished she turned to me and said:\n\n\"Now!\" I took from my pocket the rescript of Don Bernardino de\nEscoban's narrative and handed it to her. She looked at it, turned over\nthe pages, and glanced at them as she went. Then she returned to the\nbeginning, and after reading the first few lines, said to me with an\neager look in her eyes:\n\n\"Is this really the translation of the secret writing? Oh, I am so glad\nyou have succeeded. You are cute!\" She took out her watch, and having\nlooked at it, went on: \"We have loads of time. Won't you read it for me?\nIt will be so much nicer! And let me ask you questions.\"\n\n\"Delighted!\" I answered, \"But would it not be better if I read it right\nthrough first, and then let you ask questions! Or better still you read\nit yourself right through, and then ask.\" I had a purpose in this. If I\nhad to read it, my eyes must be wholly engrossed in my work; but if she\nread, I need never take them off her face. I longed to see the varying\nexpression with which she would follow every phase of the strange story.\nShe thought for a few seconds before answering, and as she thought\nlooked me straight in the eyes. I think she read my secret, or at any\nrate enough of it to fathom my wish; nothing else could account for the\ngentle blush that spread over her face. Then she said in quite a meek\ntone:\n\n\"I shall read it myself if you think it best!\"\n\nI shall never forget that reading. Her face, always expressive, was to\nme like an open book. I was by this time quite familiar with de\nEscoban's narrative, as I had with infinite patience dug it out letter\nby letter from the cipher in which it had been buried for so long. As\nalso I had written it out fair twice over, it was little wonder that\nI knew it well. As she read I so followed that I could have told to a\nsentence how far she had got in the history. Once she unconsciously put\nher hand to her throat and felt the brooch; but immediately drew it\naway again, glancing for a moment at me from under her eyelashes to see\nwhether I had observed. She saw I had, shook her head with a smile, and\nread on.\n\nWhen she had finished reading, she gave a long sigh and then held out\nher hand to me saying:\n\n\"Bravo! I congratulate you with all my heart!\" Her touch thrilled me;\nshe was all on fire, and there was a purposeful look in her face which\nwas outside and beyond any joy that she could have with regard to any\nsuccess of mine. This struck me so much that I said impulsively:\n\n\"Why are you so glad?\" She answered instinctively and without thought:\n\n\"Because you will keep it from the Spaniards!\" Then she stopped\nsuddenly, with a gesture of self repression.\n\nI felt a little piqued. I would have thought that her concern would have\nbeen rather individual than political. That in such a matter even before\nracial hatred would have come gladness at the well-doing of even such a\nfriend--without prejudice--as I was. Looking at me, she seemed to see\nthrough me and said\n\n    \"With her two white hands extended, as if praying one offended:\"\n\n\"Oh, I am sorry! I did not mean to hurt you. I can't explain yet; not\nto-day, which is for comradeship only.--Yes without prejudice\"--for she\nsaw my look and answered it \"But some day you will understand.\" She was\nso evidently embarrassed and pained at having for some reason which I\ndid not comprehend to show reticence to me who had been so open with\nher, that I felt it my duty to put her at ease. This I tried to do by\nassuring her that I quite understood that she had some good reason,\nand that I was quite content to wait. I could not help adding before I\nstopped: \"This is a small thing to have to wait for after all; when I\nhave to wait for something so much more important.\" The warning finger\nwas held up again with a smile.\n\nThen we went over the whole of the narrative again, I reading this time\nand she stopping to ask me questions. There was not much to ask; all the\nstory was so plain that the proceeding did not take very long. Then she\nasked me to explain how I had come to decipher the cryptogram. I took\nout my pocket book and proceeded to make a key to the cipher, explaining\nas I went on the principle. \"To me,\" I said, \"it is very complete, and\ncan be used in an infinity of ways. Any mode of expression can be used\nthat has two objects with five varieties of each.\" Here she interrupted\nme. As I was explaining I was holding out my hands with the fingers\nspread as a natural way of expressing my meaning. She saw at once what\nhad escaped me, and clasping her hands exclaimed impulsively:\n\n\"Like your two hands! It is delightful! Two hands, and five fingers\non each. We can talk a new deaf and dumb alphabet; which no one but\nourselves can understand!\" Her words thrilled through me. One more\nsecret to share with her; one more secret which would be in perpetual\nexercise, in pursuance of a common thought. I was about to speak when\nshe stopped me with a gesture. \"Sorry!\" she said. \"Go on; explain to me!\nWe can think of variety later!\" So I continued:\n\n\"So long as we have means that are suitable, we have only to translate\ninto the biliteral, and we who know this can understand. Thus we have a\ndouble guard of secrecy. There are some who could translate into symbols\nwith which they are familiar, symbols with which they are not; but in\nthis method we have a buffer of ignorance or mystery between the known\nand the unknown. There is also this advantage; the cipher as it stands\nis sufficiently on a basis of science or at any rate of order, that its\nkey is easily capable of reproduction. As you have seen, I can make\na key without any help. Bacon's biliteral cipher is scientifically\naccurate. It can, therefore, be easily reproduced; the method of\nexclusions is also entirely rational, so that we need have no difficulty\nin remembering it. If two people would take the trouble to learn the\nsymbols of the biliteral, as kept after the exclusions and which are\nused in this cipher, they might with very little practice be able to\nwrite or read off-hand. Indeed the suggestion, which you have just made,\nof a deaf-and-dumb alphabet is capital. It is as simple as the daylight!\nYou have only to decide whether the thumb or the little finger means 1\nor 2; and then reproduce by right hand or left, and using the fingers\nof each hand, the five symbols of the amended biliteral, and you can\ntalk as well and as easily as do the deaf mutes!\" Again she spoke out\nimpulsively:\n\n\"Let us both learn off by heart the symbols of our cipher; and then we\nshan't want even to make a key. We can talk to each other in a crowd,\nand no one be the wiser of what we are saying.\"\n\nThis was very sweet to me. When a man is in love, as I was, anything\nwhich links him to his lady, and to her alone, has a charm beyond words.\nHere was a perpetual link, if we cared to make it so, and if the Fates\nwould be good to us.\n\n\"The Fates!\" With the thought came back Gormala's words to me at the\nbeginning. She had told me, and somehow I seemed to have always believed\nthe same, that the Fates worked to their own end and in their own way.\nKindness or unkindness had no part in their workings; pity had no place\nat the beginning of their interest, no more than had remorse at the end.\nWas it possible that in the scheme of Fate, in which Gormala and I and\nLauchlane Macleod had places, there was also a place for Marjory? The\nWitch-woman had said that the Fates would work their will, though for\nthe doing of it came elements out of past centuries and from the ends of\nthe earth. The cipher of Don de Escoban had lain hidden three centuries,\nonly to be revived at its due time. Marjory had come from a nation which\nhad no existence when the Don had lived, and from a place which in his\ntime was the far home of the red man and the wolf and the bison and the\nbear.\n\nBut yet what was there to connect Marjory with Don de Escoban and his\nsecret? As I thought, I saw Marjory who had turned her back to me,\nquietly take something from her throat and put it into her pocket. Here\nwas the clue indeed.\n\nThe brooch! When I had taken it up from the sea at the Sand Craigs I had\nreturned it to her with only a glance; and as I had often seen it since,\nwithout any mystery, I had hardly noticed it. It rushed in on my mind\nthat it was of the same form as that described by Don de Escoban as\nhaving been given by the Pope. I had only noticed a big figure and a\nlittle one; but surely it could be none other than a figure of St.\nChristopher. I should have liked to have asked Marjory about it at once;\nbut her words already spoken putting off explanation, and her recent\nact, of which I was supposed to know nothing, in putting it out of\nsight, forbade me to inquire. All the more I thought, however; and other\nmatters regarding it crowded into my mind.\n\nThe chain was complete, the only weak link being the connection between\nMarjory and the St. Christopher brooch. And even here there was a\nmystery, acknowledged in her concealment, which might explain itself\nwhen the time came.\n\nMatters took such a grave turn for me with my latest surmise, that I\nthought it would be well to improve the occasion with Marjory, in so far\nas it might be possible to learn something of her surroundings. I was\nbarred from asking questions by her own wish; but still I did not like\nto lose the chance without an effort, so I said to her:\n\n\"We have learned a lot to-day, haven't we?\"\n\n\"Indeed we have. It hardly seems possible that a day could make such a\nchange!\"\n\n\"I suppose we should take it that new knowledge should apply new\nconditions to established fact?\" I said this with some diffidence; and I\ncould see that the change in my tone, much against my will, attracted\nher attention. She evidently understood my wish, for she answered with\ndecision:\n\n\"If you mean by 'new conditions' any alteration of the compact made\nbetween us for to-day--yes, I remember 'without prejudice'--there is\nnothing in our new knowledge to alter the old ones. Do remember, sir,\nthat this day is one set apart, and nothing that is not a very grave\nmatter indeed can be allowed to alter what is established regarding it.\"\n\n\"Then,\" said I, \"at all events let us learn the cipher--our cipher as\nyou very properly called it.\"\n\n\"Oh no! surely?\" this was said with a rising blush.\n\n\"Indeed, yes--I am glad to say!\"\n\n\"Take care!\" she replied, meaningly, then she added:\n\n\"Very well! Ours let it be. But really and truly I have no right to its\ndiscovery; it makes me feel like a fraud to hear you say so.\"\n\n\"Be easy,\" I replied. \"You helped me more than I can say. It was your\nsuggestion to reduce the terms of the biliteral; and it was by that\nmeans that I read the cipher. But at any rate when we call it 'ours' it\nwill content me if the word 'ours'\"--I could not help repeating the word\nfor it was delight to me; it did not displease her either, though it\nmade her blush--\"is applied not to invention but to possession!\"\n\n\"All right,\" she said. \"That is good of you. I cannot argue with you.\nAmendment accepted! Come, let us get on our wheels again. You have the\nkey of _our_ cipher with you; you can tell me the items one by one, and\nwe will learn them as we go along.\"\n\nAnd so as we swept round Davan Lake, with the wind behind us driving us\nalong except just before we regained the high road at Dinnet, I repeated\nthe symbols of the reduced biliteral. We went over and over them again\nand again, till we were unable to puzzle each other questioning up and\ndown, 'dodging' as the school-boys say.\n\nOh, but that ride was delightful! There was some sort of conscious\nequality between us which I could see my comrade felt as well as myself.\nDown the falling road we sped almost without effort, our wheels seeming\nto glide on air. When we came to the bridge over the railway just above\nAboyne, where the river comes north and runs in under a bank of shale\nand rock, we dismounted and looked back. Behind us was our last view of\nthe gorge above Ballater, where the two round hills stood as portals,\nand where the cloud rack hanging above and beyond made a mystery which\nwas full of delightful fascination and no less delightful remembrance.\nThen with a sigh we turned.\n\nThere, before us lay a dark alley between the closing pines. No less\nmysterious, but seemingly dark and grim.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\nA PECULIAR DINNER-PARTY\n\n\nWe did not stop at Aboyne, but ran on beyond Kincardine O'Neill, and\ntook our second rest close to the Bridge of Potarch where we had tea at\nthe little hotel on the right bank of the river. Then for a while we\nleaned over the parapet and looked at the water flowing swiftly far\nbelow as the river narrows from its pebbly bed to the gorge of rock on\nwhich the bridge rests. There is something soothing, perhaps something\nhypnotic, in the ceaseless rush of water. It unconsciously takes one's\nthoughts on and on, till the reality of the present is in some measure\nlost and the mind wanders towards imagination through the regions of the\nunknown. As I looked at Marjory, with the afternoon sun falling on her\nsuperb figure and showing up her clear-cut profile with all the finish\nof a cameo, I could not but be struck with the union of gentleness and\nindependence which was so clearly manifested in her. Without thinking, I\nspoke out my mind. It is a privilege of those who understand each other,\nor of the very young, to give voice to the latter portion of a train of\nthought without feeling it necessary to enlighten the hearer as to what\nhas gone to make up the conclusion. The feeling was hourly growing upon\nme that, even if I could not quite understand Marjory, at least she\nunderstood me.\n\n\"But then all you American girls are so independent!\" She did not seem\na bit surprised by this fag end of reasoning; she had evidently been\nfollowing up some train of thought of her own, and by some happy\ninstinct my words fitted in with it. Without turning towards me, but\nstill keeping her eyes fixed down the stream to where far away it swayed\nto the right through a gap between pine clad hills she answered:\n\n\"Yes! We are as a rule brought up to be independent. It seems to be a\npart of what our people call the 'genius' of the country. Indeed for\nmany, women as well as men, it is a sort of necessity. Our nation is\nso vast, and it expands so quickly, that there is nearly everywhere\na family separation. In the main, all the children of one generation\nbecome the heads of families of the next. Somehow, the bulk of our young\npeople still follow the sunset; and in the new life which comes to\neach, whether in the fields or in the city or in the reclamation of\nthe wilderness, the one thing which makes life endurable is this\nindependence which is another form of self-reliance. This it is which\nenables them to brave hunger and thirst and all danger which comes to\npioneers; which in the cities makes the solitude of lonely life bearable\nto the young as well as to the old; which makes them work and study\nin patience; which makes them self-sacrificing, and thrifty, and long\nenduring. I tell you it is this which makes a race of patriots, whose\nvoices swell in unison till the great voice of the nation, raised in\nsome good cause, can ring and echo through the world!\" As she spoke she\ngot more and more earnest, more and more enthusiastic, till her voice\nbegan to vibrate and her face to flush. When she turned towards me at\nthe end, her eyes were full of spiritual light. I looked at her, and I\nsuppose my love as well as my admiration must have expressed itself, for\nher eyes fell and the flush on her face melted into a soft blush. She\nturned, looked at the water again, and then went on speaking:\n\n\"This is the good side of our independence and _faute de mieux_ it\nserves; those who know no better do not miss what might be. But oh! it\nhas to be paid for. The little sufferings of day by day can grow into a\nmass which in the end outweighs those seemingly far greater ills which\nmanifest themselves all at once. No one knows, no one ever will know,\nhow much quiet, dull pain goes to tame a woman's heart to the solitude\nof life. I have not seen so much of it as some others; my life has been\nlaid in pleasant places, and only through the small accidents of life\nhave I come to know of the negative pain which other girls have to\nendure. It is so much to have round one the familiar faces of our youth;\nto meet sympathy at every turn of life, and to know that there is\nunderstanding for us always. We women have to give something in order to\nbe happy. The stronger-minded ones, as we call them, blame the Creator\nfor this disposition of things--or else I do not know who or what they\nblame; but the rest of us, who are wise enough to accept what cannot\nbe altered, try to realise what can be done for the best. We all want\nto care for some one or something, if it is only a cat or a dog. For\nmyself, so far back as I can remember, I longed to have a brother or\nsister, but I think that in my secret heart it was a brother I wanted.\nOf course as I merged into my actual surroundings I grew out of this;\nbut once it was brought home to me with new force. We were staying for a\nfew days in one of those great English houses where there was a growing\nfamily of boys and girls. There was one sweet young girl, just about my\nown age, who seemed idolised by all her brothers. When we arrived they\nwere all going in to evening prayers. The last of the sunlight was\nfalling through the old stained glass window of the great baronial hall,\nand lit up the little family group. The girl sat between two of her\nyoung brothers, great stalwart lads who had all the characteristics of\na family of soldiers. During prayers each of them held one of her hands;\nand when they all knelt, her arms went round their necks. I could not\nhelp feeling deeply--down into the very depths of my soul--how good\nit was for them all. I would have given everything I have, or am ever\nlikely to have, that mine had been such an upbringing. Think, how in\nafter years it will come back to those boys in hours of trial, or pain,\nor prosperity, or passion; in all times when their manhood or their\nhonour or their worth is to be tried; how they will remember the words\nwhich were spoken to them as those were spoken, and were listened to as\nthose were listened to, in the midst of sympathy and love. Many and many\na time in years to come those boys will bless such hours, and God\nHimself will surely rejoice that His will was being wrought in so sweet\na way. And the same thing is going on in a thousand English homes!\" She\npaused and turned to me and the feeling in her heart found expression in\nthe silent tears that ran down her cheeks. Again she turned her eyes to\nthe running water and gazed awhile before speaking again. Then looking\nat me, she went on:\n\n\"And the girl, too, how good it was for her! What an antidote to\nselfishness! How much of self-control, of sympathy, of love, of\ntoleration was begun and fostered and completed in those moments of the\nexpression of her heart! What place can there really be for selfish want\nand sorrows in the heart of a woman so trained to sympathise with and\nhelp others? It is good! good! good! and I pray that in the later\ndevelopment of my own dear country, all such things may have a part.\nExpansion at its present rate must soon cease; and then some predominant\nidea must take the place of the eternal self-independence. We shall, I\ntrust, moult no feather of our national feeling of personal duty; but\nI am sure that our people, and more especially our women, will lead\nhappier as well as healthier lives.\"\n\nThis present phase of Marjory's character was new to me, fresh and\nenchanting. Every hour seemed to bring out new worths and beauties of\nthe girl's character, of her intellectual gifts, of the endless wealth\nof her heart.\n\nWhen she ceased speaking I took her hand in mine, she not resenting, and\nkissed it. I said only one word \"Marjory!\" but it was enough. I could\nsee that in her eyes which made my heart leap.\n\nThen a new life seemed to come to both of us. With one accord we moved\ntowards our bicycles, and mounted in silence. After a few minutes of\nrapid spin down the sloping road from the bridge, we began to chat again\ngaily. For myself I was in wildly joyous spirits. Even a self-doubting\nlover could not fail to understand such a look in his mistress's eyes.\nIf ever love spoke out in eloquent silence it was then, all doubt melted\nfrom my heart, as the night shadows pale before the dawn. I was content\nto wait now, illimitably and in silence. She, too, seemed altogether\nhappy, and accepted in unquestioning faith all the little pleasures\nwhich came in the progress of our journey. And such pleasures are many.\nAs we drew down the valley of the Dee, with the mountains falling\nback and the dark pinewoods running up them like tongues of flame and\nemphasising by their gloom the brightness of grass and heather which\ncropped up amongst the rocks beyond, every turn of the road brought us\nto some new scene of peaceful beauty. From under the splendid woods of\nCrathes Castle we saw the river running like a blue ribbon far to the\neast and on either side of it fields and gardens and woods spreading\nwide. On we sped with delight in every moment, till at last through\nmiles of shady woods we came to the great stone bridge, and ended our\njaunt over the rough granite cobblestones of Aberdeen.\n\nWe were a little before the time the train was due; so leaving our\nwheels in the Palace Hotel we went down on the platform to meet Mrs.\nJack on her arrival.\n\nWe met her in due course, and brought her up to the hotel. At the\nstairway Marjory, who had lingered half a flight behind her companion,\nwhispered to me:\n\n\"You have been a good boy to-day, a real good boy; and you shall before\nlong have your reward.\" As she gave me her hand, I whispered:\n\n\"I am content to wait now Marjory; dear Marjory!\" She blushed and\nsmiled, and fled upstairs with a warning finger laid upon her lips.\n\nIt had been understood that I was to dine with Mrs. Jack and her friend,\nso I went up to the room which I had secured, to change my clothes.\nWhen I came down, in what I thought was a reasonable time, I went to\nthe private sitting-room and knocked. As there was no answer I knocked\nagain; then receiving no reply I took it for granted that the ladies had\nnot yet come from their rooms and entered.\n\nThe room was empty but on the table which was laid for dinner for three\nwas a note in Marjory's hand directed to me. With a sinking of the heart\nI opened it, and stood for a few minutes amazed. It had no apostrophe\nand ran as follows:--\n\n  \"We have had to leave suddenly, but Mrs. Jack wants you to oblige\n  her very much if you will be so good. Stay in the room, and when\n  dinner is served sit down by yourself and eat it. Please, please do\n  not think hardly of Mrs. Jack's request; and do not fail to carry it\n  out. There is good reason for it, as you will very soon know. More\n  depends on your doing as Mrs. Jack\"--the \"Mrs. Jack\" was written\n  over an obliterated \"I\"--\"asks than you may think. I am sure that by\n  this time you know you can trust me.\n\n  \"MARJORY.\"\n\nThe situation was disappointing and both humiliating and embarrassing.\nTo be a guest under such conditions was almost ridiculous; and under\nordinary circumstances I should have refused. But then I remembered that\nlast look of Marjory's eyes at the bridge of Potarch! Without a word, or\nanother thought, of revolt I sat down to the dinner which the waiter was\njust now bringing into the room.\n\nAs it was evident to me that my staying in the room was for some purpose\nof delay, I lingered over my wine and had two cigars before I came\naway.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\nREVELATIONS\n\n\nIn the hall I met together two men whom I knew well. The first was\nAdams of the American Embassy in London; the second Cathcart of the\nBritish Embassy at Washington, now on leave. I had not seen either\nfor two years, and it was with mutual pleasure that we met. After our\npreliminary handshaking, and the inevitable drink at the American's\nrequest, Adams slapped me on the shoulder and said heartily:\n\n\"Well, old fellow, I congratulate you; or rather am I to congratulate\nyou?\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" I asked in feeble embarrassment.\n\n\"All right, old chap!\" he said heartily. \"Your blush is enough. I see it\nhasn't come off yet at all events!\" A man never lets well alone when he\nis in an awkward position. If I had only held my tongue I might not have\nmade a guy of myself; but as I was in doubt as to what might be the\nissue of my suit to Marjory, I felt additionally constrained to affect\nignorance of his meaning. So I floundered on:\n\n\"'Come off yet'? What on earth do you mean?\" Again he slapped me on the\nback as he said in his chaffing way:\n\n\"My dear boy I saw you come in over the bridge. You had had a long ride\nI could see by your wheels; and I am bound to say that you did seem on\nexcellent terms with each other!\" This was getting dangerous ground, so\nI tried to sheer off. \"Oh,\" I said, \"you mean my bike ride with Miss\nAnita\"--I was interrupted by his sudden whistle.\n\n\"Oh,\" he said in exact imitation of my own manner. \"You mean Miss Anita!\nSo it has come to that already! Anyhow I congratulate you heartily,\nwhether it has come, or may come, or will come to anything else.\"\n\n\"I don't see,\" I said, with a helpless feeling of having been driven\ninto a corner, \"that there is anything especially remarkable in a man\nhaving a bicycle ride with a young lady of his acquaintance.\"\n\n\"Keep your hair on, old man!\" he said with a smile. \"There is nothing\nremarkable about a man riding with a young lady; but there is something\nvery remarkable about any man riding with this particular young lady.\nWhy, man alive, don't you know that there isn't a man in America, or out\nof it, that wouldn't give the eyes out of his head to take your place on\nsuch an occasion. To ride alone with Marjory Drake--\"\n\n\"With whom?\" I said impulsively; and having spoken could have bitten\nout my tongue. Adams paused; he was silent so long that I began to grow\nuneasy. His face grew very grave, and there spread over it that look\nbetween cunning and dominance which was his official expression. Then he\nspoke, but his words had not the same careless ring in them. There was a\nmanifest caution and a certain indefinable sense of distance.\n\n\"Look here, Archie Hunter! Is it possible that you don't know who it is\nthat you were with. All right! I know of course that you are acquainted\nwith her personally,\" for he saw I was about to protest, \"the very fact\nof your being with her and your knowing the name that she seldom uses\nanswer for that; and you may take it from me that the lady needs no\ncharacter for discretion from me. But how is it that you are on such\ngood terms with her, and yet don't seem even to know her name?\" For\nfully a minute there was silence between us. Cathcart had as yet\nsaid not a word, and Adams was thinking. For myself I was in a sea of\nmultitudinous concerns; whichever way I turned I was face to face with\nsome new difficulty. It would not do to leave these men under the\nimpression that there was any social irregularity in my friendship with\nMarjory; I was too jealous of her good name to allow such a thing to be\npossible. And yet I could not explain at length how we had come to be\nsuch good friends. Already there were so many little mysteries; right up\nto this very evening when she and Mrs. Jack had gone away so strangely,\nleaving me in the ridiculous position of a guest with no host. It was\nnot easy to explain these things; it was impossible to avoid them. In\nthe midst of this chaotic whirl of thoughts Adams spoke:\n\n\"I think I had better say no more, anyhow. After all, if Miss Drake\nchooses to keep a secret, or to make one, it is not my business to give\nit, or her, away. She knows what she's doing. You will excuse me, old\nfellow, won't you; but as it is manifestly a lady's wish, I think I can\ndo best by holding my tongue.\"\n\n\"Any wish of that lady's,\" said I, and I felt that I must seem to speak\ngrandiloquently, \"can only have my most loyal support.\"\n\nThere was an awkward silence which was relieved by Cathcart, who said to\nme:\n\n\"Come up to my room, Archie; I want to tell you something. You'll join\nus, too, Sam, won't you?\"\n\n\"All right, Billy,\" said Adams, \"I'll come in a few minutes. I want to\ngive some directions about a horse for to-morrow.\"\n\nWhen we were in Cathcart's room, he closed the door and said to me with\nthe most genuine good feeling:\n\n\"I didn't like to say a word downstairs, old chap; but I could see you\nwere in some difficulty. Of course I know it's all right; but ought you\nnot to know something of the lady? With any one else but Sam and myself\nsuch a thing might have conveyed a false impression. Surely you can best\nprotect the lady by knowing how to avoid anything that might embarrass\nher!\" This was all good sound common sense. For a moment I weighed up\nthe matter against the possibility of Marjory's wishing to keep her name\na secret. Looking back, however, I could see that any concealment that\nhad been was rather positive than negative. The original error had been\nmine; she had simply allowed it to pass. The whole thing had probably\nbeen the passing fancy of a bright, spirited young girl; to take it too\nseriously, or to make too much of it might do harm. Why, even these\nmen might, were I to regard it as important, take it as some piece of\ndeliberate deceit on her part. Thus convinced of the wisdom of\nCathcart's proposition I spoke:\n\n\"You are quite right! and I shall be much obliged if you will--if you\nwill enlighten me.\" He bowed and smiled, and went on genially:\n\n\"The lady you called Miss Anita, you so far called quite correctly. Her\nname is Anita; but it is only her second Christian name. She is known to\nthe world as Miss Marjory Drake, of Chicago.\"\n\n\"Known to the world.\" Was this a mere phrase, or the simple expression\nof a fact! I asked directly:\n\n\"How known to the world? Do you mean that is the name known amongst her\ncircle of acquaintances? Is--is there any cause why the great world\noutside that circle should know her at all?\" He smiled and laid his\nhand on my shoulder in a very brotherly way as he answered:\n\n\"Yes, old fellow. There is a reason, and a good one, why the great world\nshould know her. I see you are all in the dark; so I had better tell you\nwhat I know. Marjory Anita Drake is an heiress, a great heiress, a very\ngreat heiress; perhaps a long way the greatest heiress in America, or\nout of it. Her father, who died when she was a baby, left her a gigantic\nfortune; and her trustees have multiplied it over and over again.\" He\npaused; so I said--it seeming necessary to say something:\n\n\"But being an heiress is not sufficient reason why a girl should be\nknown to the world.\"\n\n\"It is a pretty good one. Most people wouldn't want any better. But this\nis not the reason in her case. She is the girl who gave the battle ship\nto the American Government!\"\n\n\"Gave the battle ship! I don't understand!\"\n\n\"It was this way. At the time the reports kept crowding in of the\nSpanish atrocities on the _reconcentrados_; when public feeling was\nrising in the United States, this girl got all on fire to free Cuba. To\nthis end she bought a battle ship that the Cramp's had built for Japan.\nShe had the ship armed with Krupp cannon which she bought through\nfriends in Italy; and went along the Eastern coast amongst the sailors\nand fishermen till she had recruited a crew. Then she handed the whole\nthing over to the Government as a spur to it to take some action. The\nship is officered with men from the Naval Academy at Annapolis; and\nthey tell me there isn't one of the crew--from the cabin boy to the\ncaptain--that wouldn't die for the girl to-morrow.\"\n\n\"Bravo!\" I said instinctively! \"That's a girl for a nation to be proud\nof!\"\n\n\"She is all that!\" said Cathcart enthusiastically. \"Now you can\nunderstand why Adams congratulated you; and why he was so surprised when\nyou did not seem to know who she was.\" I stood for a moment thinking,\nand all the clouds which wrapped Marjory's purpose in mystery seemed to\ndisperse. This, then, was why she allowed the error of her name to pass.\nShe had not made an _incognita_; chance had done this for her, and\nshe had simply accepted it. Doubtless, wearied with praise and with\npublicity and notoriety in all its popular forms, she was glad to get\naway and hide herself for a while. Fortune had thrown in her way a man\nwho was manifestly ignorant of her very existence; and it was a pleasure\nto play with him at hide-and-seek!\n\nIt was, after all, an up-to-date story of the Princess in disguise; and\nI was the young man, all unknowing, with whom she had played.\n\nHere a terrible doubt assailed me. Other Princesses had played\nhide-and-seek; and, having had their sport, had vanished; leaving\ndesolation and an empty heart behind them. Was it possible that she too\nwas like this; that she had been all the while playing with me; that\neven whilst she was being most gracious, she was taking steps to\nhide even her whereabouts from me? Here was I, who had even proposed\nmarriage; and yet who did not even know when or where I should see her\nagain--if indeed I should ever see her again at all. I could not believe\nit. I had looked into her eyes, and had seen the truth. Here was no\nwanton playing at bowls with men's hearts. My life upon her faith!\n\nI seemed to have lost myself in a sort of trance. I was recalled from it\nby Cathcart, who seeing me in a reverie had gone over to the fireplace\nand stood with his back to me, filling his pipe at the mantel-piece:\n\n\"I think I hear Adams coming. Pardon me, old fellow, but though I am\nsure he knows I have told you about Miss Drake, and though he probably\nmade an excuse for delay so that I might have an opportunity to do so,\nhe wants to appear not to enter on the subject. He is _diplomat_ all\nover. Remember he is of the U.\u00c2\u00a0S. Embassy; and Miss Drake, as an\nAmerican citizen, is theoretically under his care in this foreign\ncountry. Let us be talking of something else when he comes in!\" Sam came\nalong the passage softly whistling a bar of \"Yankee Doodle.\" Cathcart\nnodded to me and whispered:\n\n\"I told you so! He takes good care that he may not surprise us.\" When he\ncame in we were talking of the prospects of the Autumn fishing on the\nDee.\n\nWhen we left Cathcart's room, after a cigar, I, being somewhat tired\nwith my long ride, went at once to my room. Adams came with me as far as\nthe door.\n\nI was just getting into bed when I heard a slight tap at the door. I\nunlocked it and found Adams without. He raised a warning hand, and said\nin a whisper:\n\n\"May I come in? I want to say something very privately.\" More than ever\nmystified--everything seemed a mystery now--I opened the door. He came\nin and I closed it softly and locked it.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\nSAM ADAMS'S TASK\n\n\nAdams began at once: \"Archie I want to tell you something; but it is in\nthe strictest confidence. You must promise me not to mention to any one,\nmind _any one_, what I say; or even that I have spoken to you on the\nsubject.\" I thought for a moment before replying. It flashed across me\nthat what he had to say must concern Marjory, so I answered:\n\n\"I fear I cannot make such a promise, if the matter is regarding some\none other than myself.\" A shade of annoyance passed across his face as\nhe said:\n\n\"Well, it is about some one else; but really you must trust me. I would\nnot for the world, old fellow, ask you to do anything that was not\ncorrect.\"\n\n\"I know that\" I said \"I know it right well; but you see it might be\nregarding some one with whom my relations might be peculiar--not fixed\nyou know. It might be necessary for me to speak. Perhaps not now; but\nlater on.\" I was stumbling blindly, so sought refuge in fact and query,\n\"Tell me\" I said \"does it relate to Miss Drake?\"\n\n\"It does; but I thought that you who are a friend of hers might like to\ndo her a service.\"\n\n\"Of course I would.\" I answered. \"There is nothing I would not do for\nher if it were in my power.\"\n\n\"Except hold your tongue!\" he said with a touch of bitterness unusual\nwith him. I could see that anxious as I was to hear he was still more\nanxious to tell me; so I was able to keep my temper and not make matters\nworse by answering back sarcastically. I said:\n\n\"Yes, old chap, even by holding my tongue. If I could see that I would\nbenefit her by holding my tongue, or by cutting out my tongue, I would\ndo it. What I must refuse is to _promise_ to hold my tongue. Come, old\nfellow, don't put me in a wrong position. You don't know all that I do,\nor exactly how I am placed. Why don't you trust me? I am willing to\npromise that I won't speak at all of the matter unless it be necessary;\nand that I won't speak at all in any case of having been told anything\nby you.\" He brightened up at once and said:\n\n\"All right, then we can drive on. I take it that since we met\nlast\"--that was a few minutes ago, but he was a diplomatist--\"you have\nlearned more about Miss Drake, or rather of her history and her position\nand importance, than you knew at that time?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I answered, and I could not help smiling.\n\n\"Then we needn't go into that. We take facts for granted. Well, that\nfine act of hers--you know what I mean--has brought her, or may bring\nher, a peck of trouble. There are, or there were, a certain lot of\nSpaniards--Copperheads--at home who look on her as a sort of embodiment\nof the American antagonism to their own nation. They are the low lot;\nfor mind you, though we are at war with them I say it, the good Spaniard\nis a fine fellow. It came to the ears of the authorities in Washington\nthat there was some sort of plot on foot to do her a harm. The Secret\nService was a little at fault, and couldn't get accurate or full\ninformation; for naturally enough the Spaniards didn't trust any but\nthemselves in such a matter. We know enough, however, to be somewhat\nconcerned for her; and it was arranged that a secret watch should be\nkept on her, so that no harm should come that could be prevented. The\nproper men had been detailed off for the work; when to our surprise, and\na little to our consternation, it turned out that the young lady had\ndisappeared. We knew of course that her going was voluntary; she had\nleft word to that effect, so that there might not be any bother made\nabout her. But the trouble was that she did not know of the danger which\nthreatened her; and as our people didn't know where she was, no step\ncould be taken to protect or warn her. It is clear that my lady got\ntired of fireworks and of the Joan of Arc business, and bolted. It was\nconsidered necessary at headquarters that we should in the meantime all\nkeep our heads shut. But we were advised at the Embassy in London that\nthe plot was on, and that we should hump ourselves a bit to look after\nher in case she was in England. The matter was handed over to me, and I\nhave been on the run ever since; but I have not been able to hear tale\nor tiding of her. Two days ago we got a cable in our cipher which told\nus that, from information received and the rest of it, they suspected\nshe was in England, or probably in Scotland; and that there was later\nevidence that the plot was more active than ever. Unfortunately we have\nas yet no details, and not even a clue. That is why I am here. I came\ndown with Cathcart, who fortunately was bound for the North, as it\ncovered up my purpose. I have been in a regular stew for days past.\nMarjory Drake is too good to have any trouble come to her that any\nAmerican can help. You can imagine my delight when I saw her this\nevening; for now that I have located her, I can take steps to look after\nher safety if necessary. You two went so fast on your wheels that I lost\nyou at the Bridge; but I surmised that you would be coming here anyhow\nafter your ride. So I came up as quickly as I could, and saw you two and\nthe old lady come up from the railway station. I couldn't get to see\nMiss Drake to-night; but I expect to look her up pretty early in the\nmorning.\"\n\nHere was a new entanglement. It seemed to me as more than likely\nthat Marjory, having seen Adams and knowing his diplomatic position,\nsuspected some interference with her liberty, and made an escape at\nonce. This, then, was the reason why she had asked me to stay and eat\ndinner alone; I was to cover up her tracks and secure her a night's\ndelay. Thus, even to Adams, my tongue was tied as to her movements. I\ndid not wish to seem to deceive him, so avoided the subject. In answer\nto him I asked:\n\n\"But tell me, old fellow, how and where do I come into your story? Why\ndo you tell me this?\" He answered very gravely:\n\n\"Because I want your help. This is, or rather may be, a very serious\nmatter to Miss Drake. The whole business is entrusted by our government\nto my chief, who has detailed me on the service. It is of so delicate\nand secret a nature that I cannot make confidence with many people, and\nI am loth to trust any one but a gentleman. Besides Miss Drake is a very\npeculiar girl. She is absolutely independent, thoroughly determined, and\nmore than plucky. If she knew there was a plot on foot, as likely as not\nshe would try to encourage it out of mere recklessness; and would try\nto counterplot all by herself. Her enemies know this, and will avail\nthemselves of every chance and of every false move of hers; so that she\nmight help to work out herself the evil intended for her. This we cannot\npermit; and I am quite sure that you, who are a friend of hers, are at\none with me here. Now, if you want to know exactly how you can help I\nwill tell you; and you will, I am sure, pardon me if I say too much--or\ntoo little. If she were to know that the matter of her protection was\na Government one, nothing on earth would make her yield herself to our\nviews. But if it were suggested by a--a friend whom she--she valued, her\naction would probably be quite the opposite. She is a girl all heart and\nsoul. When she is taken rightly you can lead her with a thread; but you\ncan't drag her with gun-ropes. From what I saw yesterday, I am inclined\nto think that you might have more influence with her than any one else I\ncould pick out.\"\n\nI could not say anything to this, either positive or negative, so I\nremained silent. He went on:\n\n\"There is one other reason why I ask you to help, but it is secondary to\nthe other one, believe me, and one I only use to fortify a better one.\nI ask you as an old friend to help me in a matter which, even if you\nare not concerned in it, may be of the utmost importance to me in my\ndiplomatic career. This matter has been placed in my hands, and it would\nnot do for me to fail. There is not much \u00ce\u00ba\u00cf\u0085\u00ce\u00b4\u00ce\u00bf\u00cf\u0082 to be got out of it if\nall be well--except with my immediate chiefs; but if I failed it would\ngo far against me. If Marjory Drake should suffer from this Spanish\nplot, she who had, so to speak, fired the torch of the nation in the\nwar, it would be formal, official ruin to me. There wouldn't be a man\nfrom Maine to California, from the Lakes to the Gulf, who wouldn't look\non me as an imbecile, or worse!\" Whilst he was speaking I was thinking,\nand trying to make up my mind as to what I should do. Manifestly, I\ncould not tell him of the dawning relations between Marjory and myself.\nI was not yet prepared to speak of the Pope's treasure. I could not in\nhonour give away Marjory's confidence in me in asking me to cover up her\nescape, or the implied promise of my acceptance of it. Still, Adams's\nconfidence required some measure of frankness from me. His last appeal\nto me as an old friend to help him as an individual in an important\nwork, which might mar if it could not make him, demanded that I should\nstretch every point I could in his favour. So I said:\n\n\"Sam, I shall do all I honestly or honourably can. But I must ask you\nto wait a while and trust me. The fact is I am not at liberty just at\npresent to turn any way I choose. I am already committed to certain\nconfidences, which were made before I saw you or had any knowledge of\nwhat you tell me. Moreover, I am in certain ways ignorant in matters\nthat you would not expect. I shall at once take every step I can to be\nin a position to speak to you more freely. I am more deeply stirred, old\nfellow, by what you have told me than I can say; and out of the depths\nof my heart I am grateful to you and your Government for your care for\nMiss Anita--Miss Drake. I may say this, that until to-morrow at all\nevents, I am unable to help you in any possible way. Were I to try to do\nanything till a certain thing happens, it would hinder rather than help\nyour purpose. So wait patiently and do please try to understand me.\"\n\nHe replied with unwonted sarcasm:\n\n\"Try to understand you! Why man alive I've been trying whilst you were\nspeaking, until my brain reels. But I'm blamed if I can make head or\ntail of what you say. You seem to be snarled up in more knots than a\nconjuror. What the hell does it all mean? You don't seem to be able to\nturn anywhere or do anything, even when the safety or the life of such a\ngirl as Marjory Drake is in question. On my faith Mr. Hunter I hope I\ndon't make any mistake about you!\"\n\n\"Yes, you do, Sam!\" I said quietly, for I could not but feel that he had\ngood cause for disappointment or even anger. \"At the first moment I am\nfree to do so, I shall tell you all I can; and you shall then see that\nI am only doing what you would under similar circumstances do yourself.\nWon't you trust me, old friend!\" He gazed at me steadily for a few\nseconds, and then his look softened.\n\n\"By God I will!\" he said, as he held out his hand.\n\n\"Now tell me,\" I said \"what can I do to keep in touch with you. I must\ngo back to Cruden in the morning. It is necessary.\" This was in answer\nto his questioning look. \"It is the first step in my doing as you wish.\"\nI knew that Marjory would send to me, if at all, to Cruden. \"But tell me\nhow or where I can wire you in case we are not within hail.\" For answer\nhe pulled out of his pocket a bundle of \"priority\" telegrams addressed\nto the United States Embassy in London.\n\n\"Take them and use them as may be required. I am in constant touch with\nthe Embassy and they will know where to find me. How will I find you?\"\n\n\"Send to me care of Post-office, Cruden Bay,\" I said, \"I shall keep you\nadvised of wherever I may be.\" With that we said good night.\n\n\"I shall see you in the morning,\" he said as he went out.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\nFIREWORKS AND JOAN OF ARC\n\n\nFor some time I did not sleep. Things were hurrying on so fast; and\nso many new events and facts and dangers were coming to light, that I\nhardly knew where to begin to think. Of course all things concerning\nMarjory, principally her safety, took the first place. What could be\nthis Spanish plot; what could be its method or its purpose? At first\nwhen Adams had told me of it, I had not been much concerned; it\nseemed so far away, so improbable, that I fear I did not take it with\nsufficient gravity. I had not thought at the time that the two nations\nwere actually at war, and that already, both before the war and during\nit, deeds of desperate treachery had been done, the memory of which were\nnot even obliterated by the valour and chivalry which had been shown\nby the nobler of America's foes. \"_Remember The Maine_\" was still a\nwatchword and war cry. There were many scoundrels, such as chiefly\ncome to the surface in war time, who would undertake any work, however\ndeadly, however brutal, however dangerous. Such villains might be at\nwork even now! With a bound I was out upon the floor. In that moment of\nconcrete thought of danger to Marjory I realised to the full the danger\nof my own ignorance of her situation, and even of the locality where she\nmight be. This impotence to do anything was simply maddening; when I\nfelt it I could not but understand the annoyance of Adams in feeling a\nmeasure of the same impotence, with what looked like my obstinacy added.\nBut think how I would, I could do nothing till I should see Marjory or\nhear from her. With this thought, which, under the circumstances, was\nmore than harrowing, I went back to bed.\n\nI was waked by the knocking of Adams who in reply to my \"Come,\" slipped\nin and shut the door behind him.\n\n\"They are gone!\"\n\n\"Who?\" I asked mechanically, though I well knew.\n\n\"Miss Drake and her friend. They went away last night, just after you\ncame back from the station. By the way, I thought you dined with them?\"\nhe said interrogatively, and with a dash of suspicion in his tone.\n\n\"I was to dine with them;\" I answered \"but they were not there.\" He made\na long pause.\n\n\"I don't understand!\" he said. I felt that as the time which I was\nto cover had passed, I might speak; for all sakes I wanted to avoid\ncollision with Adams or the appearance of deceiving him. So I said:\n\n\"I can tell you now, Sam. I was asked to dine last night with Mrs. Jack\nand Miss Anita--Miss Drake. When I came down to the room I found a\nletter saying that they had to go away and making a special request that\nI would dine alone, just as though they were there. I was not to say\na word to any one about their being away. Please understand, my dear\nfellow--and I must ask you to take it that this is only a hint which you\nmust accept and not attempt to follow up--that there are reasons why I\nshould act on any request of Miss Drake's, blindfold. I told you last\nnight that my hands were tied; this was one of the cords. To-day I hold\nmyself free to explain I may now also tell you more. Last night I could\ndo nothing. I could take no step myself, nor could I help you to take\none; simply for the reason that I do not know where Miss Drake is\nstaying. She is I know stopping, or was till lately, somewhere on the\neastern side of Aberdeen County; but where the place is I have not the\nfaintest idea. I expect to know very shortly; and the moment I know I\nwill try to inform you, unless I am forbidden. You will know in time\nthat I have spoken exact truth; though you may have found my words or\nmeaning hard to understand. I am more than anxious to put Marjory on\nguard. When you left me last night, the whole deadly seriousness of the\nmatter grew on me, till I was as miserable as a man can be.\" His face\nlightened as I spoke.\n\n\"Well,\" he said \"at least we are one in the matter; that is something.\nI feared you were, and would be, working against me. Now look here, I\nhave been thinking the matter over, and I daresay I have come nearer to\nunderstanding your position than you imagine. I don't want to limit or\nhamper you in working in your own way for Miss Drake's good; but I may\ntell you this. I mean to find her if I can, and in my own way. I am not\nfettered anywhere, except by the necessary secrecy. Outside of this I am\nfree to act. I shall keep you advised at Cruden.\"\n\nBefore I was dressed I had another visitor. This time it was Cathcart\nwho, with considerable diffidence and all the shamefaced embarrassment\nof an Englishman when doing a kindly action in which he may be taken as\nintruding, offered me his services. I tried to set him at ease by the\nheartiness of my thanks. Upon which he expanded enough to say:\n\n\"From something Adams let drop--in all confidence believe me--I gather\nyou are or may be in trouble about some friend. If this should be, and\nfrom my heart I trust it may not, I hope you will bear in mind that I\nam a friend, and unattached. I am pretty well alone in the world so far\nas family is concerned, and there is no one to interfere with me. Indeed\nthere are some who would be happy, for testamentary reasons, to attend\nmy funeral. I hope you will remember this, old chap, if there is any fun\ngoing.\" Then he went away, easy of carriage and debonair as usual. It\nwas in such wise that this gallant gentleman made me a proffer of his\nlife. It moved me more than I can tell.\n\nI went down to Cruden by the next train, and arranged with the\npostmaster to send on to me at once by messenger or wire any telegram\nthat might come directed as I had told Adams.\n\nTowards dusk a letter was brought to me. It was in Marjory's hand, and\non my asking at once how it had come, I was told that it was brought by\na mounted man who on handing it in had said \"no answer\" and had ridden\naway.\n\nWith hope and joy and misgiving mingled I opened it. All these feelings\nwere justified by the few words it contained:\n\n\"Meet me to-morrow at eleven at Pircappies.\"\n\nI passed the night with what patience I could, and rose early. At ten I\ntook a light boat and rowed by myself from Port Erroll across the bay.\nI hung round outside the Skares, ostensibly fishing but keeping watch\nfor any sign of Marjory; for from this point I could see the road to\nWhinnyfold and the path by the beach. A little before eleven I saw a\nwoman wheeling a bicycle down the Whinnyfold laneway. Taking in my\nlines, I pulled, quietly and avoiding any appearance of hurry, for I\nknew not whether any one might see us, into the tiny harbour behind the\njutting rock. Marjory arrived just at the same time, and I rejoiced\nto see that her face bore no mark or sign of care. As yet nothing had\nhappened. We met with a slight hand shake; but there was a look in her\neyes which made my heart leap. For the past thirty-six hours my anxiety\nfor her had put aside every other feeling. I had not thought of myself,\nand therefore not of my love for her; but now my selfish instinct woke\nagain in full force. In her presence, and in the jubilance of my own\nheart, fear in all forms seemed as impossible to realise as that the\nburning sun above us should be blotted out with falling snow. With one\nof her mysterious signs of silence she pointed to the rock that here\nstretches out into the sea, and whose top is crowned with long sea\ngrass. Together we climbed the face of the cliff, and bearing across the\nnarrow promontory passed over the top of the rock. We found a cosy nest\nhidden behind it. Here we were absolutely isolated from the world; out\nof earshot of every one, and out of sight except from beyond the stretch\nof rocky sea. In a demure way she acknowledged my satisfaction.\n\n\"Isn't it a nice place. I chose it out yesterday when I was here!\" For\nan instant I felt as though she had struck me. Just to think that she\nhad been here yesterday, whilst I was waiting for her only across the\nbay, eating my heart out. However, there was no use looking back. She\nwas with me now, and we were alone. The whole delight of the thing\nswept away every other feeling. With a pretty little motion of settling\nherself comfortably, and which to me seemed to prelude a long talk, she\nbegan:\n\n\"I suppose you know a lot about me now?\"\n\n\"How do you mean?\"\n\n\"Come now, don't prevaricate. I saw Sam Adams in Aberdeen, and of course\nhe told you all about me.\" I interrupted:\n\n\"No he didn't.\" The very tone of my voice enlightened her. With a smile\nshe said:\n\n\"Then some one else did. Answer me some questions. What is my name?\"\n\n\"Marjory Anita Drake.\"\n\n\"Am I poor?\"\n\n\"In the way of money, no.\"\n\n\"Right! Why did I leave America?\"\n\n\"To run away from the fireworks and the Joan of Arc business.\"\n\n\"Right again; but that sounds mighty like Sam Adams. Well, that's all\nright; now we may begin. I want to tell you something which you don't\nknow.\" She paused. Half in delight and half in fear, for her appearance\nof purpose alarmed me, I set myself to listen.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX\n\nON CHANGING ONE'S NAME\n\n\nWith a smile Marjory began:\n\n\"You are satisfied that it was because of the fireworks and Joan of Arc\nbusiness that I came away?\"\n\n\"Oh yes!\"\n\n\"And that this was the final and determining cause?\"\n\n\"Why certainly!\"\n\n\"Then you are wrong!\" I looked at her in wonder and in some secret\nconcern. If I were wrong in this belief, then why not in others? If\nAdams's belief and my acceptance of it were erroneous, what new mystery\nwas there to be revealed? Just at present things had been looking so\nwell for the accomplishment of my wishes that any disturbance must be\nunwelcome. Marjory, watching me from under her eyelashes, had by this\ntime summed me up. The stern look which she always had when her brows\nwere fixed in thought, melted into a smile which was partly happy,\npartly mischievous, and wholly girlish.\n\n\"Make your mind easy, Archie\" she said, and oh! how my heart leaped when\nshe addressed me by my Christian name for the first time. \"There isn't\nanything to get uneasy about. I'll tell you what it was if you wish.\"\n\n\"Certainly I wish, if you don't dislike telling me.\"\n\nSo she went on:\n\n\"I did not mind the fireworks; that is I did mind them and liked them\ntoo. Between you and me, there has to be a lot of fireworks for one to\nobject to them. People may say what they please, but it's only those who\nhave not tasted popular favour that say they don't like it. I don't know\nhow Joan of Arc felt, but I've a pretty cute idea that she was like\nother girls. If she enjoyed being cheered and made much of as well as\nI did, no wonder that she kept up the game as long as she could. What\nbroke me all up was the proposals of marriage! It's all very well\ngetting proposed to by people you know, and that you don't dislike. But\nwhen you get a washing basket full of proposals every morning by the\npost; when seedy looking scallywags ogle you; when smug young men with\nsoft hats and no chins wait outside your door to hand you their own\npoems; and when greasy cranks stop your carriage to proffer their hearts\nto you before your servants, it becomes too much. Of course you can burn\nthe letters, though there are some of them too good and too honest not\nto treat their writers with respect. But the cranks and egotists, and\nscallywags and publicans and sinners, the loafers that float round one\nlike an unwholesome miasma; these are too many and too various, and too\nawful to cope with. I felt the conviction so driven in to me that the\ngirl, or at any rate her personality, counts for so little, but that her\nmoney, or her notoriety, or celebrity or whatever it is, counts for so\nmuch, that I couldn't bear to meet strangers at all. Burglars and ghosts\nand tigers and snakes and all kinds of things that dart out on you\nare bad enough; but I tell you that proposers on the pounce are a holy\nterror. Why, at last I began to distrust everyone. There wasn't an\nunmarried man of my acquaintance that I didn't begin to suspect of some\ndesign; and then the funny part of it was that if they didn't come up\nto the scratch I felt aggrieved. It was awfully unfair wasn't it? But I\ncould not help it. I wonder if there is a sort of moral jaundice which\nmakes one see colours all wrong! If there is, I had it; and so I just\ncame away to get cured if I could.\n\n\"You can't imagine the freedom which it was to me not to be made much\nof and run after. Of course there was a disappointing side to it;\nI'm afraid people's heads swell very quick! But, all told, it was\ndelightful. Mrs. Jack had come with me, and I had covered up my tracks\nat home so that no one would be worried. We ran up to Canada, and at\nMontreal took a steamer to Liverpool. We got out, however, at Moville.\nWe had given false names, so that we couldn't be tracked.\" Here she\nstopped; and a shy look grew over her face. I waited, for I thought it\nwould embarrass her less to tell things in her own way than to be asked\nquestions. The shy look grew into a rosy blush, through which came that\ndivine truth which now and again can shine from a girl's eyes. She said\nin quite a different way from any in which she had spoken to me as yet;\nwith a gentle appealing gravity:\n\n\"That was why I let you keep the wrong impression as to my name. I\ncouldn't bear that you, who had been so good to me, should, at the very\nstart of our--our friendship, find me out in a piece of falsity. And\nthen when we knew each other better, and after you had treated me with\nso much confidence about the Second Sight and Gormala and the Treasure,\nit made me feel so guilty every time I thought of it that I was ashamed\nto speak.\" She stopped and I ventured to take her hand. I said in as\nconsolatory a way as I could:\n\n\"But my dear, that was not any deceit--to me at any rate. You took\nanother name to avoid trouble before ever I even saw you; how then could\nI be aggrieved. Besides\" I added, feeling bolder as she did not make any\neffort to draw away her hand, \"I should be the last person in the world\nto object to your changing your name!\"\n\n\"Why?\" she asked raising her eyes to mine with a glance which shot\nthrough me. This was pure coquetry; she knew just as well as I did what\nI meant. All the same, however, I said:\n\n\"Because I too want you to change it!\" She did not say a word, but\nlooked down.\n\nI was now sure of my ground, and without a word I bent over and kissed\nher. She did not draw back. Her arms went round me; and in an instant I\nhad a glimpse of heaven.\n\nPresently she put me away gently and said:\n\n\"There was another reason why I did not speak all that time. I can tell\nit to you now.\"\n\n\"Pardon me\" I interrupted \"but before you tell me, am I to take it\nthat--well, what has just been between us--is an affirmative answer to\nmy question?\" Her teeth flashed as well as her eyes as she answered:\n\n\"Have you any doubt? Was there any imperfection in the answer? If so,\nperhaps we had better read it as 'no.'\"\n\nMy answer was not verbal; but it was satisfactory to me. Then she went\non:\n\n\"I can surely tell you now at all events. Have you still doubts?\"\n\n\"Yes\" said I, \"many, very many, hundreds, thousands, millions, all of\nwhich are clamouring for instant satisfaction!\" She said quietly and\nvery demurely, at the same time raising that warning hand which I\nalready well knew, and which I could not but feel was apt to have an\ninfluence on my life, though I had no doubt but that it would always be\nfor good:\n\n\"Then as there are so many, there is not the slightest use trying to\ndeal with them now.\"\n\n\"All right\" I said \"we shall take them in proper season and deal with\nthem seriatim.\" She said nothing, but she looked happy.\n\nI felt so happy myself that the very air round us, and the sunshine,\nand the sea, seemed full of joyous song. There was music even in the\nscreaming of the myriad seagulls sweeping overhead, and in the wash of\nthe rising and falling waves at our feet. I kept my eyes on Marjory as\nshe went on to speak:\n\n\"Oh, it is a delight to be able to tell you now what a pleasure it was\nto me to know that you, who knew nothing of me, of my money, or my ship,\nor all the fireworks and Joan of Arc business--I shall never forget that\nphrase--had come to me for myself alone. It was a pleasure which I could\nnot help prolonging. Even had I had no awkwardness in telling my name,\nI should have kept it back if possible; so that, till we had made our\ninner feelings known to each other, I should have been able to revel in\nthis assurance of personal attraction;\" I was so happy that I felt I\ncould interrupt:\n\n\"That sounds an awfully stilted way of putting it, is it not?\" I said.\n\"May I take it that what you mean is, that though you loved me a\nlittle--of course after I had shown you that I loved you a great\ndeal--you still wished to keep me on a string; so that my ignorance of\nyour extrinsic qualities might add a flavour to your enjoyment of my\npersonal devotion?\"\n\n\"You talk\" she said with a joyful smile \"like a small book with gilt\nedges! And now, I know you want to know more of my surroundings, where\nwe are living and what are our plans.\"\n\nHer words brought a sort of cold shiver to me. In my great happiness I\nhad forgotten for the time all anxiety for her safety. In a rush there\nswept over me all the matters which had caused me such anguish of mind\nfor the last day and a half. She saw the change in me, and with poetic\nfeeling put in picturesque form her evident concern:\n\n\"Archie, what troubles you? your face is like a cloud passing over a\ncornfield!\"\n\n\"I am anxious about you\" I said. \"In the perfection of happiness\nwhich you have given me, I forgot for the moment some things that are\ntroubling me.\" With infinite gentleness, and with that sweet tenderness\nwhich is the sympathetic facet of love, she laid her hand on mine and\nsaid:\n\n\"Tell me what troubles you. I have a right to know now, have I not?\" For\nanswer I raised her hand and kissed it; then holding it in mine I went\non:\n\n\"At the same time that I learned about you, I heard of some other things\nwhich have caused me much anxiety. You will help to put me at ease,\nwon't you?\"\n\n\"Anything you like I shall do. I am all yours now!\"\n\n\"Thank you, my darling, thank you!\" was all I could say; her sweet\nsurrender of herself overwhelmed me. \"But I shall tell you later; in the\nmeantime tell me all about yourself, for that is a part of what I wait\nfor.\" So she spoke:\n\n\"We are living, Mrs. Jack and I, in an old Castle some miles back in the\ncountry from here. First I must tell you that Mrs. Jack is my old nurse.\nHer husband had been a workman of my father's in his pioneer days. When\nDad made his own pile he took care of Jack--Jack Dempsey his name was,\nbut we never called him anything but Jack. His wife was Mrs. Jack then,\nand has been so ever since to me. When mother died, Mrs. Jack, who had\nlost her husband a little while before, came to take care of me. Then\nwhen father died she took care of everything; and has been like a mother\nto me ever since. As I dare say you have noticed, she has never got over\nthe deferential manner which she used to have in her poorer days. But\nMrs. Jack is a rich woman as women go; if some of my proposers had an\nidea of how much money she has they would never let her alone till she\nmarried some one. I think she got a little frightened at the way I was\ntreated; and there was a secret conviction that she might be the next to\nsuffer. If it hadn't been for that, I doubt if she would ever, even to\nplease me, have fallen in with my mad scheme of running away under false\nnames. When we came to London we saw the people at Morgan's; and the\ngentleman who had charge of our affairs undertook to keep silence as to\nus. He was a nice old man, and I told him enough of the state of affairs\nfor him to understand that I had a good reason for lying dark. I thought\nthat Scotland might be a good place to hide in for a time; so we looked\nabout amongst the land agents for a house where we would not be likely\nto be found. They offered us a lot; but at last they told us of one\nbetween Ellon and Peterhead, way back from the road. We found it in a\ndip between a lot of hills where you would never suspect there was a\nhouse at all, especially as it was closely surrounded with a wood. It is\nin reality an old castle, built about two or three hundred years ago.\nThe people who own it--Barnard by name, are away, the agent told us, and\nthe place was to let year after year but no one has ever taken it. He\ndidn't seem to know much about the owners as he had only seen their\nsolicitor; but he said they might come some time and ask to visit the\nhouse. It is an interesting old place, but awfully gloomy. There are\nsteel trellis gates, and great oak doors bound with steel, that rumble\nlike thunder when you shut them. There are vaulted roofs; and windows in\nthe thickness of the wall, which though they are big enough to sit in,\nare only slits at the outside. Oh! it is a perfect daisy of an old\nhouse. You must come and see it! I will take you all over it; that is,\nover all I can, for there are some parts of it shut off and locked up.\"\n\n\"When may I go?\" I asked.\n\n\"Well, I had thought,\" she answered, \"that it would be very nice if you\nwere to get your wheel and ride over with me to-day.\"\n\n\"Count me in every time! By the way what is the name of the place?\"\n\n\"Crom Castle. Crom is the name of the little village, but it is a couple\nof miles away.\" I paused a while thinking before I spoke. Then with my\nmind made up I said:\n\n\"Before we leave here I want to speak of something which, however\nunimportant you may think it, makes me anxious. You will let me at the\nbeginning beg, won't you, that you do not ask me who my informant is, or\nnot to tell you anything except what I think advisable.\" Her face grew\ngrave as she said:\n\n\"You frighten me! But Archie, dear, I trust you. I trust you; and you\nmay speak plainly. I shall understand.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX\n\nCOMRADESHIP\n\n\n\"I want you to promise me that you will not hide yourself where I cannot\nfind you. I have grave reason for the request. Also, I want you, if\nyou will, to let some others know where you are.\" At first there was\ninstinctive defiance in her mouth and nostrils. Then her brows wrinkled\nin thought; the sequence was an index to character which I could not but\nnotice. However the war was not long; reason, whatever was the outcome\nof its dominance, triumphed over impulse. I thought I could understand\nthe logical process which led to her spoken conclusion:\n\n\"You want to report me to 'Uncle Sam'.\"\n\n\"That's about it!\" I answered, and hurried on to give her a reason\nbefore she made up her mind to object.\n\n\"Remember, my dear, that your nation is at war; and, though you are\nat present safe in a country friendly to both belligerents, there are\nevil-minded people in all countries who will take advantage of anything\nunusual, to work their own ends. That splendid gift of yours to the\nnation, while it has made you a public favourite and won for you\nmillions of friends--and proposals--has yet made for you a host of\nenemies. It is not as if you had given a hospital-ship or an ambulance.\nYour gift belongs to the war side and calls out active hatred; and no\ndoubt there are men banded together to do you harm. This cannot be\nallowed. Your friends, and the nation as a whole, would take any step\nto prevent such a thing; but they might all be powerless if you were\nhidden anywhere where they could not find you.\" As I spoke, Marjory\nlooked at me keenly, not with hostility, but with genuine interest. When\nI had finished she said quietly:\n\n\"That is very well; but now tell me, dear\"--how the word thrilled me; it\nwas the first time she had used it to me--\"did Sam Adams fill you up\nwith that argument, or is it your own? Don't think me nasty; but I want\nto know something of what is going on. Believe me, I am willing to\ndo all _you_ wish if it is your own will; and I am grateful for your\nthought for me. But I don't want you to be a mere mouthpiece for any\nparty moves by the politicians at home.\"\n\n\"How do you mean?\"\n\n\"My dear boy, I don't suppose you know enough of American politics to\nsee how a certain lot would use to their own advantage anything that\ncame in their way. Anybody or anything which the public takes an\ninterest in would be, and is, used by them unscrupulously. Why, if the\nhangers-on to the war party wanted to make a show, they might enroll my\nproposers and start a new battalion.\"\n\n\"But,\" I remonstrated, \"you don't think the Government is like that?\" In\nreply she smiled:\n\n\"I don't altogether know about that. Parties are parties all the world\nover. But of course the Washington people wouldn't do things that are\ndone by local politicians. And one other thing. Don't imagine for a\nmoment that I think Sam Adams is anything of the kind. He belongs to the\nservice of the nation and takes his orders from his chief. How can he,\nor any one fixed like him, know the ins and outs of things; except\nfrom what he hears privately from home, or gathers from what goes on\naround him if he is cute?\" It appeared to me that all this was tending\nto establish an argument against taking the American Embassy into\nconfidence, so I struck in before it should be complete. As I was not\nat liberty to take Marjory into confidence with regard to my source of\ninformation, I had to try to get her to agree to what I thought right or\nnecessary on other grounds:\n\n\"My dearest, can you not leave out politics, American or otherwise. What\non earth have politics to do with us?\" She opened her eyes in wonder;\nshe was reasoning better than I was. With an air of conviction she said:\n\n\"Why, everything! If any one wants to do me harm, it must be on the\ngrounds of politics. I don't believe there is any one in the world who\ncould want to injure me on private grounds. Oh! my dear, I don't want\nto talk about it, not even to you; but all my life I have tried to help\nother people in a quiet way. My guardians would tell you that I have\nasked them for too much money to give to charities; and personally I\nhave tried to do what a girl can in a helpful way to others. I have been\nin hospitals and homes of all kinds; and I have classes of girls in my\nown house and try to make them happier and better. Archie, don't think\npoorly of me for speaking like this; but I couldn't bear that _you_\nshould think I had no sense of the responsibility of great wealth. I\nhave always looked on it as a trust; and I hope, my dear, that in time\nto come you will help me to bear the burden and to share the trust!\" I\nhad thought up to now that I couldn't love her more than I did. But when\nI heard her words, and recognised the high purpose that lay behind them,\nand saw the sweet embarrassment which came to her in speaking them to\nme, I felt that I had been mistaken. She looked at me lovingly, and,\nholding my hand in both of hers, went on:\n\n\"What then could hurt me except it came from the political side. I could\nquite understand it if Spaniards wished to harm me, for I have done\nwhat I can to hinder them from murdering and torturing other victims.\nAnd I could understand if some of our own low-down politicians would try\nto use me as a stalking horse, though they wouldn't harm me. I want to\nkeep clear of politics; and I tell you frankly that I shall if I can.\"\n\n\"But Marjory dear, there may be, I believe there are, Spaniards who\nwould try to harm you. If you were in America you would be safer from\nthem; for there at present, whilst the war is on, every stranger is a\nmarked man. Here, on neutral ground, foreigners are free; and they are\nnot watched and observed in the same way. If there were such fiends, and\nI am told there are, they might do you a harm before any one could know\ntheir intention or have time to forestall them.\"\n\nAll the native independence of Marjory's race and nature stood out in\nstrong relief as she answered me:\n\n\"My dear Archie, I come from a race of men who have held their lives in\ntheir hands from the cradle to the grave. My father, and my grandfather,\nand my great grandfather were pioneers in Illinois, in Kentucky, in\nthe Rockies and California. They knew that there were treacherous foes\nbehind them every hour of their lives; and yet they were not afraid. And\nI am not afraid either. Their blood is in my veins, and speaks loudly to\nme when any sense of fear comes near me. Their brains, as well as their\nhands, kept guard on their lives; and my brains are like theirs. I do\nnot fear any foe, open or secret. Indeed, when I think of a secret foe\nall the keenness of my people wakes in me, and I want to fight. And this\nsecret work is a way in which a woman can fight in an age like ours. If\nmy enemies plot, I can counter-plot; if they watch without faltering to\ncatch me off guard, I can keep guard unflinchingly. A woman can't go out\nnow-a-days, except at odd times, and fight with weapons like Joan of\nArc, or the Maid of Saragossa; but she can do her fighting in her own\nway, level with her time. I don't see that if there is to be danger\naround me, why I shouldn't do as my ancestors did, fight harder than\ntheir foes. Here! let me tell you something now, that I intended to say\nlater. Do you know what race of men I come from? Does my name tell you\nnothing? If not, then this will!\"\n\nShe took from her neck, where again it had been concealed by a lace\ncollar, the golden jewel which I had rescued from the sea. As I took it\nin my hand and examined it she went on:\n\n\"That came to me from my father, who got it from his, and he from his,\non and on till our story of it, which is only verbal, for we have no\nrecords, is lost in the legend that it is a relic of the Armada brought\nto America by two cousins who had married, both being of the family to\nwhich the great Sir Francis Drake belonged. I didn't know, till lately,\nand none of us ever did, where exactly in the family the last owners of\nthe brooch came in, or how they became possessed of such a beautiful\njewel. But you have told me in your translation of Don de Escoban's\nnarrative. That was the jewel that Benvenuto Cellini made in duplicate\nwhen he wrought the figurehead for the Pope's galley. The Pope gave it\nto Bernardino de Escoban, and he gave it to Admiral Pedro de Valdes.\nI have been looking up the history of the time since I saw you, and I\nfound that Admiral de Valdes when he was taken prisoner by Sir Francis\nDrake at the fight with the Armada was kept, pending his ransom, in the\nhouse of Richard Drake, kinsman of Sir Francis. How the Drake family got\npossession of the brooch I don't know; but anyhow I don't suppose they\nstole it. They were a kindly lot in private, any of them that I ever\nknew; though when they were in a fight they fought like demons. The old\nSpanish Dons were generous and free with their presents, and I take it\nthat when Pedro de Valdes got his ransom he made the finest gift he\ncould to those who had been kind to him. That is the way I figure it\nout.\"\n\nWhilst she was speaking, thoughts kept crowding in upon me. Here was\nindeed the missing link in the chain of Marjory's connection with the\nhidden treasure; and here was the beginning of the end of Gormala's\nprophecy, for as such I had come to regard it. The Fates were at work\nupon us. Clotho was spinning the thread which was to enmesh Marjory and\nmyself and all who were in the scheme of the old prophecy of the Mystery\nof the Sea and its working out.\n\nOnce more the sense of impotence grew upon me. We were all as\nshuttlecocks, buffeted to and fro without power to alter our course.\nWith the thought came that measure of resignation which is the anodyne\nto despair. In a sort of trance of passivity I heard Marjory's voice run\non:\n\n\"Therefore, my dear Archie, I will trust to you to help me. The\ncomradeship which has been between us, will never through this grow\nless; though nearer and dearer and closer ties may seem to overshadow\nit.\"\n\nI could not answer such reasoning; but I took her in my arms and kissed\nher. I understood, as she did, that my kisses meant acquiescence in her\nwishes. After a while I said to her:\n\n\"One thing I must do. I owe it as a duty of honour to tell my informant\nthat I am unable to give your address to the American Embassy, and that\nI cannot myself take a part in anything which is to be done except by\nyour consent. But oh! my dear, I fear we are entering on a dangerous\ncourse. We are all staying deliberately in the dark, whilst there is\nlight to be had; and we shall need all the light which we can get.\"\nThen a thought struck me and I added, \"By the way, I suppose I am free\nto give information how I can, so long as you are not committed or\ncompromised?\" She thought for quite a few minutes before she answered.\nI could see that she was weighing up the situation, and considering it\nfrom all points of view. Then she said, putting both her hands in mine:\n\n\"In this, as in all ways, Archie, I know that I can trust you. There is\nso much more than even this between us, that I should feel mean to give\nit a thought hereafter!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI\n\nTHE OLD FAR WEST AND THE NEW\n\n\nPresently Marjory jumped up and said:\n\n\"Now you must get your wheel and come over to Crom. I am burning to show\nit to you!\" We crossed the little isthmus and climbed the rocks above\nthe Reivie o' Pircappies. As we topped the steep path I almost fell back\nwith the start I gave.\n\nThere sat Gormala MacNiel, fixed and immovable as though she were of\nstone. She looked so unconcerned that I began to suspect her. At first\nshe seemed not to notice us; but I could see that she was looking at us\nunder her eyelashes. I was anxious to find out how long she had been\nthere, so I said, mentioning her name in order that Marjory might know\nwho she was:\n\n\"Why, Gormala, what has become of you? I thought you were off again to\nthe Islands. We haven't seen you for a long time.\" She replied in her\nusual uncompromising way:\n\n\"I hae nae doot that ye thocht me far, gin ye did na see me. Aye! Aye!\nthe time has been lang; but I could wait: I could wait!\"\n\n\"What were you waiting for?\" Marjory's voice seemed almost as that of a\nbeing from another world. It was so fresh, so true, so independent that\nit seemed at variance with Gormala and her whole existence. As a man\nbeside two women, I felt more as a spectator than as a participant, and\nmy first general impression was that the New World was speaking to the\nOld. Gormala seemed to me absolutely flabbergasted. She stared, and\nlooked in a dazed way, at the girl, standing up as she did so with the\ninstinctive habit, ingrained through centuries of custom, of an inferior\nto a superior. Then she moved her hand across her forehead, as though to\nclear her brain, before she replied:\n\n\"What was I waitin' for? I'll tell ye, an ye will. I was waitin' for the\nfulfillment o' the Doom. The Voices hae spoken; and what they hae said,\nwill be. There be them that would stand in the way o' Fate, and would\ntry to hinder the comin' that must be. But they will fail; they will\nfail! They can no more block the river o' time wi' ony deeds o' mon,\nthan they can dam the spate wi' a bairn's playtoy.\" Again came Marjory's\nsearching question, with all the mystery-dispelling freshness of her\nunfettered youth; and indeed it seemed as if the Old-world mystery could\nnot hold its dignity in the face of overt, direct questioning:\n\n\"By the way, what was it that the Doom said? Was it anything that an\nAmerican girl can understand?\" Gormala gazed at her in manifest wonder.\nTo her, reared in the atmosphere of the Old Far West, this product of\nthe New Far West seemed like a being of another world. Had Marjory been\nless sweet in her manner than she was, or less fair to look upon, less\ndignified, or less grave, the old woman would probably have shown\nhostility at once. But it seemed to me impossible that even a\nwitch-woman could be hostile to Marjory to-day. She looked so sweet, and\nkind and happy; so bright and joyous; so much like the incarnation of\nideal girlhood, that criticism was disarmed, and hostility could not\nforce a way into the charmed circle of that radiant presence. To me, her\nattitude towards Gormala was incomprehensible. She knew Gormala, for I\nhad told her of who and what the Seer was, and of the prophecies and\nwarnings that she had already uttered; and yet from her manner she\nappeared ignorant of all concerning both her and them. She was not\nconciliatory after the manner of the young who wish to please the old,\nor to ingratiate themselves with them. She was not hostile, as would be\none who had determined on opposition. About her or her manner there was\nnothing hard, or frivolous or contradictory. And yet it was apparent to\nme that she had some fixed, determined purpose of her own; and it became\nbefore long apparent to me also, that the other woman knew, or at any\nrate suspected, such an existence, though she could neither comprehend\nnor locate it. Gormala seemed once, twice, as though she were about to\nspeak, but hesitated; at last with an effort she spoke out:\n\n\"The Voice o' the Doom no sounds in words such as mortals can hear. It\nis spoken in sounds that are heard of the inner ear. What matter the\nwords, when the ear that hearkens can understan'!\"\n\n\"But,\" said Marjory, \"could I not be told the words, or if there were no\nactual words, could you not give me in your own words what the sounds\nuttered seemed to you to mean?\" To anyone but a Seer such a request\nwould seem reasonable enough; but visionaries who have a receptive power\nof their own, and who learn by means whose methods are unconscious to\nthem, can hardly undertake to translate the dim, wide-stretching purpose\nof the powers of the Unknown into bald, narrow, human speech. Gormala's\nbrows wrinkled up in thought; then a scowl of disappointment swept over\nher face. In an angry tone she turned to me and said:\n\n\"Wha be yon lassie that questions so blithely the truth o' the Voice\nthat is kent by ye an' me? Why dinna ye tak her awa' before she mocks\nme, an' in me the Doom; an' I speak oot to her?\" Marjory spoke up for\nherself.\n\n\"Please do not think it a liberty to ask you; but I should like so much\nto know exactly what was said. It is so easy for people to confuse ideas\nwhen words are loosely used. Don't you find it so?\" I do not think\nGormala MacNiel had any humour at all; if she had, I had certainly never\nseen any trace of it. Had it been there it would have surely saved her\nfrom anger; for there was something delicious in the way in which\nMarjory put her question, as though to one of her own kind and holding\nthe same views as herself on general matters. Gormala did not like it.\nThough there was a blank in her mind as to the existence of humour, she\nmust have felt conscious of the blank. She could not understand the\nother woman; and for a little while sought refuge in a silence composed\nof about equal parts of sulk and dignity. But Marjory was not content\nwith silence; she pressed home her question in the most polite but most\nmatter of fact way, till I could see the Witch-woman mentally writhe. I\nshould have interfered, for I did not want any unpleasant scene in which\nMarjory must have a part; but I felt that the girl had some purposeful\nmeaning in her persistence. Had Gormala had a pause in the attack\nshe would, I felt, have gone away and bided her time: but in such a\npushing of the matter as Marjory braced herself to, there could be no\nwithdrawal, unless under defeat. Gormala looked round now and again,\nas one, man or animal, does when hunted; but each time she restrained\nherself by an effort. At last her temper began to rise; her face\nflushed, and the veins, of passion stood out on her forehead. Her eyes\nflashed, and white marks began to come and go about the face, especially\nround the nose. I could see from the leap of fire in Marjory's eyes that\nthis was what she was waiting for. She lowered her voice, and the tone\nof her speaking, till both matter and manner were icily chill; but all\nthe time she persisted in her matter-of-fact questioning.\n\nAt last Gormala's temper broke, and she turned on the girl in such\na fury that for a few seconds I thought she was going to attack her\nphysically. I stood ready to hold her off if necessary. At the first\nmoment the passion in her was so great that she spoke in Gaelic; blind,\nwhite-hot fury will not allow a choice of tongues. The savage in her was\nspeaking, and it spoke in the tongue it knew best. Of course neither\nof us could understand it, and we only stood smiling. Marjory smiled\ndeliberately as though to exasperate her; I smiled because Marjory was\nsmiling. Presently, through the tumult of her passion, Gormala began to\nrealise that we did not understand her; and, with an effort which shook\nher, began to speak in English. With the English which she had, came\nintention and the restraint which it implies. Her phrases were not\ncommon curses, but rather a picturesque half prophecy with a basis of\nhate. The gravamen of her charge was that Marjory had scoffed against\nthe Doom and Fate and the Voices. To me, who had suffered the knowledge\nto which she appealed, the attack was painful. What was charged was a\nsort of natural sacrilege; and it wounded me and angered me to see\nMarjory made the subject of any attack. I was about to interfere, when\nwith a gesture, which the Witch-woman did not see, she warned me to\nsilence. She struck into the furious woman's harangue with quiet,\nincisive, cultured voice which made the other pause:\n\n\"Indeed you do me a wrong; I scoffed at nothing. I should not scoff at\nyour religion any more than I should at my own. I only asked you a few\nquestions as to facts which seemed to touch a friend of mine.\" The\npoint of this speech which, strange to say, affected the woman most was\nregarding her religion:\n\n\"Wha be ye, ye hizzie, that wad daur to misca' me that is a Christian\nwoman all my days. What be your releegion, that ye try to shame me wi'\nmine.\" Marjory said deliberately, but with all the outward appearance of\ncourtesy:\n\n\"But I did not know that in the scheme of the Christian belief there\nwere such things as the Doom and the Voice and Fate!\" The old woman\ntowered up; for a moment she was all Seer and Prophet. Her words\nthrilled through me; and I could see through Marjory also. Though she\nheld herself proudly, her lips grew pale:\n\n\"Then learn while ye may that there be lesser powers as well as greater\nin the scheme o' God's warld, and o' His working o' the wonders therein.\nYe may scoff at me wha' am after all but an aud wife; though one to whom\nare Visions given, and in whose ears the Voice has spoken. Ye may pride\nyersel' that yer ignorance is mair than the knowledge o' ithers. Ye\nmay doot the truths that hae been garnered oot o' centuries o' dour\nexperience, an' tak' the cloak o' yer ignorance as an answer to a' the\nmysteries that be. But mark me weel! the day will come--it is no far aff\nthe noo--when ye will wring yer honds, and pray wi' all the power an'\nbitter grief o' yer soul for some licht to guide ye that ye no hae had\nyet!\" She paused and stood in a sort of trance, stiffening all over like\na pointer at mark. Then she raised one hand high over her head, so that\nthe long arm seemed to extend her gaunt form to an indefinite length.\nWith a far-away solemn voice she spoke:\n\n\"I see ye too, though no by yer lanes, in the wild tide-race amang the\nrocks in the dark nicht, mid leaping waves. An' lo! o'er the waste o'\nfoam is a floatin' shrood!\" Then she stopped, and in a few seconds came\nback to herself. In the meantime Marjory, whose lips had grown white as\ndeath, though she never lost her proud bearing, groped blindly for my\nhand and held it hard. She never for a moment took her eyes off the\nother.\n\nWhen Gormala was quite her own woman again, she turned without a word\nand walked away in her gaunt, stately manner, feeling I am sure, as we\ndid, that she did not go without the honours of war. Marjory continued\nto watch her until she had passed up the track, and had disappeared\nbehind the curve of the hill.\n\nThen, all at once, she seemed to collapse in a faint; and had I not held\nher hand, and so was able to draw her into my arms, she must have fallen\nto the ground.\n\nIn a wonderfully short time she recovered her senses, and then with a\ngreat effort stood up; though she still had to steady herself by my\nhand. When she was all right again she said to me:\n\n\"I suppose you wonder why I attacked her like that. Oh! yes, I did\nattack her; I meant to,\" for she saw the question in my eyes. \"It was\nbecause she was so hostile to you. What right had she to force you to do\nanything? She is harmful to you, Archie. I know it! I know it! I know\nit! and I determined not to let her have her way. And besides,\"--this\nwith a shy loving look at me, \"as she is hostile to you she must be to\nme also. I want to be with you, even in the range of the hate and the\nlove of others. That is to be one; and as we are to fight together I\nmust share your lot in all!\" I took her in my arms, and for some divine\nmoments, our hearts beat together.\n\nIn those moments my mind was made up as to the wishes of Adams. How\ncould I refuse in any way to fight the battle, as she might wish it\nfought, of a girl who so loyally shared my lot!\n\nThen we arranged that I should go home for my bicycle, and meet Marjory\nat the bridge by the Parish Church.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII\n\nCROM CASTLE\n\n\nWhen I rejoined Marjory, we went up the high road and then turned off\nby a by-way which took us round innumerable slopes and mounds, so\ncharacteristic of this part of Aberdeen. The entire county, seen from\nhigh places, looks bare and open; but it has its hills and hollows in\nendless variety. From the cross road we turned up another and still\nanother, till I lost my bearings entirely.\n\nThe part of the country where we now were was a sort of desolation of\ncultivation; endless low hills clad with fields of wheat and barley with\nnever a house to be seen, except some far off cottage or the homestead\nof a laird perched on the top of a hill. At last we entered through an\nopen gateway with broken pillars, still bearing the remains of some\narmorial device in statuary. There was an avenue, fringed with tall\ntrees on either side, and beyond a broad belt of undergrowth. The avenue\nwound round and round in an endless series of curves. From the gate\nwhere we entered was a thick, close wood nearly a quarter of a mile in\nwidth. Here the trees stood so close, and their locking branches made\nsuch a screen, that it was quite gloomy within. Here too the road was\nmade in perpetual curves, so that it was not possible to see far ahead.\nIndeed I remarked to Marjory as we rode along:\n\n\"No wonder you chose this as a place to hide in; it looks as if it was\nmade for concealment. It is a regular Rosamund's Bower!\"\n\nWhen we had passed through the wood, we came out on a great piece of\nlevel ground with a wide mound some twenty feet high, in the midst of\nit. On this was built of granite, a crenelated castle. It was not very\nhigh, but extended wide in a square, with a low arched doorway in front\nof us through which it might be possible to drive with care. The doorway\nwas closed by two gates; first a massive network of interlocking steel\nbars of seemingly foreign workmanship, and secondly great gates of oak\nfortified with steel bands and massive bosses of hammered iron. Before\ngoing in, Marjory took me right round the castle and I saw that it was\nthe same on all four sides. It was built by the points of the compass;\nbut there was no gateway except on one side. The ordinary way of\nentering was by a more modern door on the south side. From inside the\ncastle it was not possible to see anywhere beyond the wood. Even from\nthe stone roof, made for defence, where Marjory took me, it was only\npossible to get a glimpse through the tree tops here and there of\nround-topped hills yellow with ripening grain or crowned with groves of\nscanty wind-swept pine trees. Altogether it was as gloomy a place as I\nhad ever seen. It was cut off altogether from the outer world; one might\nremain in it for a life-time unknown.\n\nInside it was, if possible, more gloomy. Small rooms almost everywhere,\nexcept the great hall, and one room at the top facing the south side\nwhich lay just under the roof and which was lined with old oak. Here\nthere were quite a number of windows such as Marjory had described, all\nof them, though wide on the inner side, narrowed to mere slits on the\nouter. In castles and houses built, like this, for defence, it did\nnot do to allow opportunities to an attacking force to send missiles\nwithin.\n\nMrs. Jack and Marjory had made this their living room, and here were all\nthe pretty treasures and knick-knacks which they had gathered on their\ntravels. The old lady welcomed me warmly. Then Marjory took her aside\nand told her something in whispers. I could guess what it was; but any\ndoubts I might have had were dispelled when she came over and kissed me\nand said:\n\n\"Indeed, I congratulate you with all my heart. You have won the best,\nand sweetest, and dearest girl that ever drew breath. I have been with\nher all my life; and I have not found a flaw in her yet. And I am glad\nthat it is you whom she has chosen. Somehow, I wished it from the first\nmoment I saw you. That you may both be happy, I pray the good Lord God!\nAnd I know you will; for you are true, and Marjory has a heart of gold.\"\n\n\"A heart of gold!\" Her words had given me more than pleasure; but the\nlast phrase pulled my joy up short. A cold shiver ran through me. A\ngolden man had been a part of the prophecy of the Mystery of the Sea;\nand only a little while ago Gormala had in her vision seen Marjory\nstruggling in the tide-race with a shroud in the air.\n\nI think Marjory felt something of the same kind, for she looked at me\nanxiously and grew a little pale. She said nothing, however, and I\nthought it better to pass the matter by. Although Marjory had heard the\nexpression of the Witch-woman's vision, and though I had told her of\nmy first experience of the old rhyming prophecy, the former was at a\ntime when neither I myself nor the whole mystery was of any special\nimportance to her. She might not have remembered it; I trusted that this\nwas so.\n\nHowever, we could not either of us be sad for long to-day. Our joy was\ntoo fresh to be dimmed by any thought of gloom, except momentarily as a\nmirror is by a passing breath.\n\nTea in the old oak room was a delight, with the afternoon sun coming\nin slantwise through the narrow windows and falling in lines of light\nacross the floor. Marjory made the tea and served me; and each time I\ntook anything from her hand our fingers met, she no more than myself\navoiding the touch. Then, leaving the old lady upstairs, she took me\nthrough the various rooms; and in her pretty, impulsive way she told me\nall the romances which she had already woven about them in her brain.\nShe came and saw me off; with her kiss of good-bye on my lips I rode\nback through the gloomy wood, feeling as proud and valiant as a knight\nof old.\n\nI found my way to Ellon and went on the train to Aberdeen, for I felt it\ndue to Adams that I should see him at once. It was impossible to write\nall I had to say; and besides I wanted to retain his good will, and to\narrange for securing his aid, if he would consent to do so under our\naltered conditions.\n\nI found him in his room hard at work. He was writing something which I\nsuppose he considered important, for he put it carefully away and locked\nhis despatch box before we began to talk. Of course it might have been\nonly his diplomatic habit; but he seemed grave over it. I entered at\nonce on the matter between us, for I thought to get the disagreeable\nside over first and let concessions and alterations follow:\n\n\"I am sorry, Sam, I shall not be able to help you with information\nregarding Miss Drake.\"\n\n\"Why? Haven't you heard from her?\"\n\n\"It is not that; but I am not free to do what you wish.\" Adams looked at\nme for a long time. Then he said quietly:\n\n\"I see. You have your orders! Well, I am sorry for it; it may bring\ndreadful harm to her, and I daresay to you too, now. Say, old chap, is\nthat decision of yours final? The matter is more grave than I thought\nwhen I saw you last. We have had more information, and they are pressing\nus from Washington to take all precautions we can. Come, won't you help\nme--help her?\"\n\n\"I can't, the way you say. Sam Adams, you know I would do anything I\ncould for you; but in this matter I am pledged. I have been given a\nsecret, and I must keep it honourably at all hazards. But look here, I\nam anxious all the same. Can't you trust me a little bit and tell me\nwhat to look for. I won't give you away; and I may be able to carry out\nyour wishes as to helping to guard her, though I have to do it in my own\nway.\" He smiled, though very bitterly and ironically. I was glad to see\nthe smile anyhow, for we were old and tried friends and I should not\nlike there to be any break between us. Besides I wanted his help; his\nknowledge now, and his resources later on, if need should be. He was an\nofficial, and the matter was an official one though his heart was in it;\nit was not as if his personal feelings or his honour had been involved.\n\n\"Well,\" he said, \"you have a fine gall anyhow! You refuse point blank to\ngive me the slightest help, though I ask it on all grounds, official for\nAmerica, personal as I am in charge, and for the sake of your own girl;\nand then you expect me to tell you all I can. Well, look here, I'll tell\nyou anything that will help you as soon as I know it, if you will keep\nme advised of exactly where you are--so--so that I may be able to find\nyou if I wish.\"\n\nI told him heartily that I would keep him posted as to my movements.\nThen, as there was nothing to remain for, I said good-bye--a good-bye, I\nam glad to say, given and taken with our old heartiness. Before I went I\nsaid:\n\n\"Sam, you know how a message can find me if there is anything you\nshould think it well to tell me.\" To which he replied:\n\n\"All right, Archie, I'll remember. You understand that as I shall have\nto work this racket alone I must do it in my own way: otherwise we shall\nhave complications. But if there is anything I can do on your side, I\nshall do it all the same. You know how to reach me. If you send for\nme I shall come any hour of the day or night. And say, old chap, I go\nheeled!\" he pointed to his pistol pocket. \"Let me advise you to do the\nsame just at present!\"\n\nI took his advice and bought in Aberdeen, before returning to Cruden,\ntwo of the finest revolvers I could get. One of them was made for a\nlady; the other I always carried myself from that day forward.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII\n\nSECRET SERVICE\n\n\nNext morning after breakfast I wheeled over to Crom, bringing in my\nbicycle bag the revolver and ammunition for Marjory. I could not but\nfeel alarmed for her safety as I rode through the wood which surrounded\nthe house. It would need a regiment to guard one from a stray assassin.\nFor myself I did not have any concern; but the conviction grew and grew\non me to the point of agony that harm which I should be powerless to\nprevent might happen here to Marjory. When I was inside the house the\nfeeling was easier. Here, the place was to all intents and purposes\nfortified, for nothing short of cannon or dynamite could make any\nimpression on it.\n\nMarjory received my present very graciously; I could see from the way\nthat she handled the weapon that she had little to learn of its use. I\nsuppose the thought must have crossed her that I might think it strange\nto find her so familiar with a lethal weapon, for she turned to me and\nsaid with that smoothness of tone which marks the end rather than the\nbeginning of a speech:\n\n\"Dad always wished me to know how to use a gun. I don't believe he was\never without one himself, even in his bed, from the time he was a small\nboy. He used to say 'It never does any one any harm to be ready to\nget the drop first, in case of a scrap!' I have a little beauty in my\ndressing-case that he got made for me. I am doubly armed now.\"\n\nI stayed to lunch, but went away immediately after as I was anxious to\nfind if Adams had sent me any message. Before going, I asked Marjory\nto be especially careful not to be out alone in the woods round the\nhouse, for a few days at any rate. She demurred at first; but finally\nagreed--'to please you' as she put it--not to go out at all till I\nhad come again. I told her that as I was coming to breakfast the next\nmorning if I might, it was not a very long time of imprisonment.\n\nWhen I asked for telegrams at the post-office, which was in the hotel,\nI was told that a gentleman was waiting to see me in the coffee room. I\nwent in at once and found Sam Adams reading an old newspaper. He started\nup when he saw me and straightway began:\n\n\"I hurried over to tell you that we have had further news. Nothing very\ndefinite to-day; but the Washington people hope to have a lot of detail\nby to-morrow night. So be ready, old chap!\" I thanked him, but even in\nthe act of doing so it struck me that he had taken a deal of trouble to\ncome over when he could have sent me a wire. I did not say so, however;\ndoubts of an act of this kind can always wait.\n\nSam had tea with me, and then we smoked a cigar outside on the little\nterrace before the hotel. There were some fishermen and workmen, as\nusual sitting on or leaning against the wall across the road, and three\nmen who were lounging about, evidently trippers waiting for their tea to\nbe served. When we came out and had passed them, the little group went\ninto the coffee room. They were, all three, keen-looking, alert men, and\nI had a passing wonder what they were doing in Cruden as they had no\ngolf bags with them. Sam did not remain long but caught the six-ten\ntrain back to Aberdeen.\n\nI cannot say that my night was an easy one. Whilst I lay awake I\nimagined new forms of danger to Marjory; and when I fell asleep I\ndreamt them. I was up early, and after a sharp ride on my bicycle came\nto Crom in time for breakfast.\n\nAs we had a long forenoon, Marjory took me over the house. It was all of\nsome interest, as it represented the life and needs of life in the later\ndays of Queen Elizabeth in a part of the country where wars and feuds\nhad to be prepared for. The Castle was arranged for siege, even to the\nwater supply; there was a well of immense depth situated in a deep\ndungeon under the angle of the castle which they called the Keep. They\ndid not, however, ordinarily depend on this, as there was otherwise an\nexcellent water supply. In the dungeon were chains and manacles and some\nimplements of torture, all covered with the rust of centuries. We hoped\nthat they had not been used. Marjory consoled herself with the thought\nthat they had been placed there at the time of the building as part of\nthe necessary furnishing of a medi\u00c3\u00a6val castle. One room, the library,\nwas of great interest. It had not been built for the purpose, for there\nwas no provision of light; but it must have been adapted to this use not\nlong after the place was built. The woodwork of carved oak was early\nseventeenth century. I did not have time to look over the books, and\nthere was no catalogue; but from the few which I glanced at I could see\nthat whoever had gathered the library must have been a scholar and an\nenthusiast.\n\nIn the course of our survey of the castle, Marjory showed me the parts\nwhich were barred up and the rooms which were locked. That such a thing\nshould be in a house in which she lived was a never-ending source of\ncuriosity. There was a dozen times as much room as she could possibly\nwant; but here was something unknown and forbidden. She being a woman,\nit became a Tree of Knowledge and a Bluebeard's Chamber in one. She was\nso eager about it that I asked if she could not get permission from the\nagent to go through the shut rooms and places so as to satisfy herself.\nShe replied that she had already done so, the very day after she had\narrived, and had had an answer that the permission could not be given\nwithout the consent of the owner; but that as he was shortly expected\nin Scotland her request would be forwarded to him and his reply when\nreceived would be at once communicated to her. Whilst we were talking of\nthe subject a telegram to Mrs. Jack came from the agent, saying that the\nowner had arrived and was happy to give permission required and that\nfurther he would be obliged if the tenant would graciously accord him\npermission to go some day soon through the house which he had not\nseen for many years. A telegram was at once sent in Mrs. Jack's name,\nthanking him for the permission and saying that the owner would be most\nwelcome to go through the house when he pleased.\n\nAs I was anxious to hear if there was any news from Adams I said\ngood-bye at the door, and rode back on my bicycle. I had asked Marjory\nto renew her promise of not going out alone for another day, and she had\nacceded; 'only to please you,' she said this time.\n\nI found a wire from Adams sent at six o'clock:\n\n\"Important news. Come here at once.\" I might catch the train if I\nhurried, so jumped on my bicycle and got to the station just in time.\n\nI found Adams in his room at the Palace Hotel, walking up and down like\na caged panther. When I came in he rushed over to me and said eagerly as\nhe handed me a sheet of note paper:\n\n\"Read that; it is a translation of our cipher telegram. I thought you\nwould never come!\" I took it with a sinking heart; any news that was so\npressing could not be good, and bad must affect Marjory somehow. I read\nthe document over twice before I fully understood its meaning. It ran as\nfollows:\n\n\"Secret Service believe that Drake plot is to kidnap and ransom. Real\nplotters are understood to be gang who stole Stewart's body. Are using\ncertain Spanish and other foreigners as catspaw. Heads of plot now\nin Europe, Spain, England, Holland. Expect more details. Use all\nprecautions.\"\n\n\"What do you think of that?\" said Adams when I had taken my eyes off the\npaper.\n\n\"I hardly know yet. What do you make of it? You have thought of it\nlonger than I have.\"\n\n\"Just what I have thought all along. The matter is serious, very\nserious! In one way that wire is something of a relief. If that\nkidnapping gang are behind it, it doesn't mean political vengeance, but\nonly boodle; so that the fear of any sudden attack on her life is not so\nimminent. The gang will take what care they can to keep from killing the\ngoose that lays the golden eggs. But then, the political desperadoes who\nwould enter on such a matter are a hard crowd; if they are in power, or\nat any rate in numerical force, they may not be easy to keep back.\nIndeed, it is possible that they too may have their own game to play,\nand may be using the blackmailers for their own purpose. I tell you, old\nman, we are in a very tight place, and must go to work pretty warily.\nThe whole thing swings so easily to one side or the other, that any\nfalse move on the part of any of us may give the push to the side we\nwould least care should win. By the way, I take it that you are of the\nsame mind still regarding Miss Drake's wishes.\"\n\n\"Now and always! But as you can guess I am anxious to know all I can\nthat can help me to guard her.\" Somewhat to my astonishment he answered\nheartily:\n\n\"All right, old chap, of course I will tell you; but I will depend on\nyour letting me know of anything you are free to tell which might serve\nme in my work.\"\n\n\"Certainly! I say,\" I added, \"you don't mind my not having worked with\nyou about finding her address.\"\n\n\"Not a bit! I have to find it in my own way; that is all!\" There was\na sort of satisfaction, if not of triumph, in his tone which set me\nthinking.\n\n\"Then you know it already?\" I said.\n\n\"Not yet; but I hope to before the night is over.\"\n\n\"Have you a clue?\" He laughed.\n\n\"Clue? a hundred. Why, man, none of us were born yesterday. There isn't\na thing on God's earth that mayn't be a clue now and again if it is\nproperly used. You are a clue yourself if it comes to that.\" In a\nflash I saw it all. Adams had come to Cruden to point me out to his\ndetectives. These were the keen-looking men who were at Cruden when he\nwas. Of course they had followed me, and Marjory's secret was no secret\nnow. I said nothing for a little while; for at the first I was angry\nthat Adams should have used me against my will. Then two feelings strove\nfor mastery; one of anxiety lest my unconscious betrayal of her secret\nmight hurt me in Marjory's eyes, the other relief that now she was in a\nmeasure protected by the resources of her great country. I was easier in\nmy mind concerning her safety when I thought of those keen, alert men\nlooking after her. Then again I thought that Adams had done nothing\nwhich I could find fault with. I should doubtless have done the same\nmyself had occasion arisen. I was chagrined, however, to think that it\nhad all been so childishly simple. I had not even contemplated such a\ncontingency. If I couldn't plot and hide my tracks better than that,\nI should be but a poor ally for Marjory in the struggle which she had\nvoluntarily undertaken against her unknown foes.\n\nBefore I left Adams, I told him that I would come back on the to-morrow\nevening. I went to bed early in the Palace hotel, as I wanted to catch\nthe first train back to Cruden.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV\n\nA SUBTLE PLAN\n\n\nIt was now a serious matter of thought to me how I could take Marjory\ninto proper confidence, without spoiling things and betraying Adams's\nconfidence. As I pondered, the conviction grew upon me that I had better\nbe quite frank with her and ask her advice. Accordingly when I saw\nher at Crom at noon I entered on the matter, though I confess with\ntrepidation. When I told her I wanted to ask her advice she was all\nattention. I felt particularly nervous as I began:\n\n\"Marjory, when a man is in a hole he ought to consult his best friend;\noughtn't he?\"\n\n\"Why certainly!\"\n\n\"And you are my best friend; are you not?\"\n\n\"I hope so! I should certainly like to be.\"\n\n\"Well, look here, dear, I am in such a tangle that I can't find a way\nout, and I want you to help me.\" She must have guessed at something like\nthe cause of my difficulty, for a faint smile passed over her face as\nshe said:\n\n\"The old trouble? Sam Adams's diplomacy, eh?\"\n\n\"It is this. I want to know how you think I should act so as to give\nleast pain to a very dear friend of mine, and at the same time do a very\nimperative duty. You may see a way out that I don't.\"\n\n\"Drive on dear; I'm listening.\"\n\n\"Since we met I have had some very disturbing information from a source\nwhich I am not at liberty to mention. I can tell you all about this,\nthough you must not ask me how I know it. But first there is something\nelse. I believe, though I do not know for certain, that your secret is\nblown; that the detectives have discovered where you live.\" She sat up\nat once.\n\n\"What!\" I went on quickly:\n\n\"And I am sorry to say that if it is discovered it has been through me;\nthough not by any act or indeed by any fault of mine.\" She laid her hand\non mine and said reassuringly:\n\n\"If you are in it, I can look at it differently. May I ask how you came\ninto that gallery?\"\n\n\"Certainly! I am not pledged as to this. It was by the most simple and\ntransparent of means. You and I were seen together. They did not know\nwhere to look for you or follow you up, when they had lost the scent;\nbut they knew me and watched me. Voila!\"\n\n\"That's simple enough anyhow!\" was her only comment. After a while she\nasked:\n\n\"Do you know how far they have got in their search?\"\n\n\"I do not; I only know that they expected to find where you lived two\ndays ago. I suppose they have found it out by this.\"\n\n\"Sam Adams is getting too clever. They will be making him President, or\nAlderman or something, if he doesn't look out. But do you know yet why\nall this trouble is being taken about me.\"\n\n\"I can tell you,\" I answered \"but you must not tell any one, for it\nwould not do for the sake of others if it got about. There is a plan got\nup by a gang of blackmailers to kidnap you for a ransom.\" She jumped up\nwith excitement and began to clap her hands.\n\n\"Oh, that is too delicious!\" she said. \"Tell me all you know of it. We\nmay be able to lead them on a bit. It will be an awful lark!\" I could\nnot possibly share her mirth; the matter was really too grave. She saw\nmy feeling in my face and stopped. She thought for a minute or two with\nher brows wrinkled and then she said:\n\n\"Are you really serious, Archie, as to any danger in the matter?\"\n\n\"My dear, there is always danger in a conspiracy of base men. We have\nto fear, for we don't know the power or numbers of the conspiracy. We\nhave no idea of their method of working, or where or how we may expect\nattack. The whole thing is a mystery to us. Doubtless it will only come\nfrom one point; but we must be ready to repel, all round the compass.\"\n\n\"But, look here, it is only danger.\"\n\n\"The danger is to you; if it were to me, I think I could laugh myself.\nBut, my darling, remember that it is out of my love for you that my fear\ncomes. If you were nothing to me, I could, I suppose, bear it easily\nenough. You have taken new responsibilities on you, Marjory, since you\nlet a man love you. His heart is before you to walk on; so you have to\ntread carefully.\"\n\n\"I can avoid treading on it, can't I?\" she said falling into the vein of\nmetaphor. \"Surely, if there is anything in the world that by instinct I\ncould know is in danger, it would be your heart!\"\n\n\"Ah, my dear, it does not stay still. It will keep rolling along with\nyou wherever you go; hopping back and forward and sideways in every\nconceivable way. You must now and again tread on it for all your care;\nin the dark or in the light.\"\n\n\"I had no idea,\" she said \"that I had taken such a responsibility on my\nshoulders when I said I would marry you.\"\n\n\"It is not the marrying\" I said \"but the loving that makes the\ntrouble!\"\n\n\"I see!\" she replied and was silent for a while. Then she turned to me\nand said very sweetly:\n\n\"Anyhow Archie, whatever we may settle about what we are to do, I am\nglad you came to consult me and to tell me frankly of your trouble. Do\nthis always, my dear. It will be best for you, and best for me too, to\nfeel that you trust me. You have given me a pleasure to-day that is\nbeyond words.\"\n\nThen we spoke of other things, and we agreed to wait till the next day\nbefore arranging any fixed plan of action. Before I went away, and\nwhilst the sentiment of parting was still on her, she said to me--and I\ncould see that the thought had been in her mind for some time:\n\n\"Archie, you and I are to live together as man and wife. Is it not\nso? I think we both want to be as nearly one as a man and a woman can\nbe--flesh of each other's flesh, and bone of bone, and soul of soul.\nDon't you think we shall become this better by being joined, us two,\nagainst all comers. We have known each other only a short time as yet.\nWhat we have seen of each other has been good enough to make us cling\ntogether for life. But, my dear, what has been, has been only the\nwishing to cling; the clinging must be the struggle that is to follow.\nBe one with me in this fight. It is my fight, I feel, begun before I\never knew you. When your fight comes, and I can see you have it before\nyou with regard to that treasure, you will know that you can count on\nme. It may be only a fancy of mine, but the comradeship of pioneers,\nwhen the men and women had to fight together against a common foe,\nruns in my blood! Let me feel, before I give myself altogether to your\nkeeping, or you to mine, that there is something of this comradeship\nbetween us; it will make love doubly dear!\"\n\nWhat could a man in love say to this? It seemed like the very essence of\nmarried love, and was doubly dear to me on that account. Pledged by my\nkisses I came away, feeling as if I had in truth left my wife behind.\n\nWhen I got back to Cruden I took up the matter of the treasure whilst I\nwas waiting for news from Adams. In the stir of the events of the last\nfew days I had almost forgotten it. I read the papers over again, as\nI wished to keep myself familiar with the facts; I also went over the\ncipher, for I did not wish to get stale in it. As I laboured through it,\nall Marjory's sweetness to me on that day of the ride from Braemar came\nback to me; and as I read I found myself unconsciously drumming out the\nsymbols on the table with the fingers of my right hand and my left after\nthe fashion of Marjory's variant. When I was through, I sat pondering,\nand all sorts of new variants kept rising before me in that kind of\nlinked succession when the mind runs free in day-dreaming and one idea\nbrings up another. I was not altogether easy, for I was now always\nexpecting some letter or telegram of a disconcerting kind; anxiety\nhad become an habitual factor in my working imagination. All sorts of\npossibilities kept arising before me, mostly with reference to Marjory.\nI was glad that already we understood in common one method of secret\ncommunication; and I determined then and there that when I went over to\nCrom on the next day I would bring the papers with me, and that Marjory\nand I would renew our lesson, and practice till we were quite familiar\nwith the cipher.\n\nJust then a message was brought to me that a gentleman wished to see\nme, so I asked the maid to bring him up. I do not think that I was\naltogether surprised to find that he was one of the three men whom I had\nseen at Cruden before. He handed me in silence a letter which I found to\nbe from Adams. I read it with a sinking heart. In it he told me that it\nwas now ascertained that two members of the blackmail gang had come to\nEngland. They had been seen to land at Dover, but got out between there\nand London; and their trace was lost. He said he wished to advise me at\nonce, so that I might be on the alert. He would himself take his own\nsteps as I understood. The messenger, when he saw I had read the letter,\nasked me if there was any answer. I said \"only thanks\" and he went away.\nIt was not till afterwards that I remembered that I might have asked the\nman to tell me something of the appearance of the suspected men, so that\nI might know them if I should come across them. Once again I fell in my\nown esteem as a competent detective. In the meantime I could do nothing;\nMarjory's last appeal to me made it impossible for me to take steps\nagainst her wishes. She manifestly wanted the fight with the kidnappers\nto go on; and she wanted me to be with her in it heart and soul.\nAlthough this community of purpose was sweet, there grew out of our very\nisolation a new source of danger, a never-ending series of dangers. The\ncomplications were growing such that it would soon be difficult to take\nany step at all with any prospect of utility. Marjory would now be\nwatched with all the power and purpose of the American Secret Service.\nThat she would before long infallibly find it out, and that she would in\nsuch case endeavour at all hazards to escape from it, was apparent. If\nshe did escape from their secret surveillance, she would be playing into\nthe hands of her enemies; and so might incur new danger. I began to\nexercise my brain as to how I could best help her wishes. If we were to\nfight together and alone, we would at least make as good a battle as we\ncould.\n\nI thought, and thought, and thought till my head began to spin; and then\nan idea all at once sprang into my view. It was so simple, and so much\nin accord with my wishes; so delightful, that I almost shouted out with\njoy.\n\nI did not lose a minute, but hurried a change of clothes into a bag and\ncaught the train for Aberdeen _en route_ for London.\n\nI did not lose any time. Next morning I was in London and went with my\nsolicitor to Doctor's Commons. There I got a license of the Archbishop\nof Canterbury entitling Archibald Hunter and Marjory Anita Drake to be\nmarried anywhere in England--there being no similar license in Scotland.\nI returned at once, stopping at Carlisle to make arrangements with a\nlocal clergyman to be ready to perform a marriage service at eight\no'clock of the second morning.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV\n\nINDUCTIVE RATIOCINATION\n\n\nI think Marjory must have suspected that I had something strange to say,\nfor almost as soon as I came in the morning room I saw that queer little\nlift of her eyebrows and wrinkle in her brows which I was accustomed\nto see when she was thinking. She held out her two hands towards me so\nthat I could see them without Mrs. Jack being able to. She held up her\nfingers in the following succession:\n\nLeft index finger, right middle finger, left little finger, right little\nfinger, left thumb, right fourth finger, right index finger, left thumb,\nright index finger; thus spelling \"wait\" in her own variant of our\nbiliteral cipher. I took her hint, and we talked commonplaces. Presently\nshe brought me up to the long oak-lined room at the top of the Castle.\nHere we were all alone; from the window seat at the far end we could see\nthat no one came into the room unknown to us. Thus we were sure of not\nbeing overhead. Marjory settled herself comfortably amongst a pile of\ncushions, \"Now\" she said \"go on and tell me all about it!\"\n\n\"About what?\" said I, fencing a little.\n\n\"The news that you are bursting to tell me. Hold on! I'll guess at\nit. You are elated, therefore it is not bad; but being news and not\nbad it must be good--from your point of view at any rate. Then you\nare jubilant, so there must be something personal in it--you are\nsufficiently an egoist for that. I am sure that nothing business-like\nor official, such as the heading off the kidnappers, would have such a\npositive effect on you. Then, it being personal, and you having rather\nmore of a dominant air than usual about you--Let me see--Oh!\" she\nstopped in confusion, and a bright blush swept over her face and neck.\nI waited. It frightened me just a wee bit to see the unerring accuracy\nwith which she summed me up; but she was clearing the ground for me\nrapidly and effectively. After a pause she said in a small voice:\n\n\"Archie show me what you have got in your waistcoat pocket.\" It was my\nturn to blush a bit now. I took out the tiny case which held the gold\nring and handed it to her. She took it with a look of adorable sweetness\nand opened it. I think she suspected only an engagement ring, for when\nshe saw it was one of plain gold she shut the box with a sudden \"Oh!\"\nand kept it hidden in her hand, whilst her face was as red as sunset. I\nfelt that my time had come.\n\n\"Shall I tell you now?\" I asked putting my arms round her.\n\n\"Yes! if you wish.\" This was said in a low voice \"But I am too surprised\nto think. What does it all mean? I thought that this--this sort of thing\ncame later, and after some time was mutually fixed for--for--_it_!\"\n\n\"No time like the present, Marjory dear!\" As she was silent, though she\nlooked at me wistfully, I went on:\n\n\"I have made a plan and I think you will approve of it. That is as a\nwhole; even if you dislike some of the details. What do you think of\nan escape from the espionage of both the police and the other fellows.\nYou got hidden before; why not again, when once you have put them off\nthe scent. I have as a matter of fact planned a little movement which\nwill at any rate try whether we can escape the watchfulness of these\ngentlemen.\"\n\n\"Good!\" she said with interest.\n\n\"Well, first of all\" I went on, getting nervous as I drew near the\nsubject \"Don't you think that it will be well to prevent anyone talking\nabout us, hereafter, in an unpleasant way?\"\n\n\"I'm afraid I don't quite understand!\"\n\n\"Well, look here, Marjory. You and I are going to be much thrown\ntogether in these matters that seem to be coming on; if there is any\nescaping to be done, there will be watchful eyes on us before it, and\ngossiping tongues afterwards; and inquiries and comparing of notes\neverywhere. We shall have to go off together, often alone or under odd\ncircumstances. You can't fight a mystery in the open, you know; and\nyou can't by walking out boldly, bamboozle trained detectives who have\nalready marked you down.\"\n\n\"Not much; but it doesn't need any torturing of our brains with thinking\nto know that.\"\n\n\"Well then my suggestion is that we be married at once. Then no one can\never say anything in the way of scandal; no matter what we do, or where\nwe go!\" My bolt was sped, and somehow my courage began to ooze away. I\nwaited to hear what she would say. She waited quite a while and then\nsaid quietly:\n\n\"Don't be frightened, Archie, I am thinking it over. I must think; it\nis all too serious and too sudden to decide on in a moment. I am glad,\nanyhow, that you show such decision of character, and turn passing\ncircumstances into the direction in which you wish them to work. It\nargues well for the future!\"\n\n\"Now you are satirical!\"\n\n\"Just a little. Don't you think there is an excuse?\" She was not quite\nsatisfied; and indeed I could not be surprised. I had thought of the\nmatter so unceasingly for the last twenty-four hours that I did not miss\nany of the arguments against myself; my natural dread of her refusal\ntook care of that. As, however, I almost expected her to begin with a\nprompt negative, I was not unduly depressed by a shade of doubt. I was,\nhowever, so single-minded in my purpose--my immediate purpose--that\nI could endure to argue with her doubts. As it was evident that she,\nnaturally enough, thought that I wanted her to marry me at once out of\nthe ardour of my love, I tried to make her aware as well as I could of\nmy consideration for her wishes. Somehow, I felt at my best as I spoke;\nand I thought that she felt it too:\n\n\"I'm not selfish in the matter, Marjory dear; at least I don't wish to\nbe. In this I am thinking of you altogether; and to prove it let me say\nthat all I suggest is the formal ceremony which will make us one in\nform. Later on--and this shall be when you choose yourself and only\nthen--we can have a real marriage, where and when you will; with flowers\nand bridesmaids and wedding cake and the whole fit out. We can be good\ncomrades still, even if we have been to church together; and I will\npromise you faithfully that till your own time I won't try to make love\nto you even when you're my wife--of course any more than I do now.\nSurely that's not too much to ask in the way of consideration.\"\n\nMy dear Marjory gave in at once. It might have been that she liked the\nidea of an immediate marriage; for she loved me, and all lovers like the\nseal of possession fixed upon their hopes:\n\n    \"Time goes on crutches, till love have all his rites.\"\n\nBut be this as it may, she wished at any rate to believe in me. She came\nto me and put both her hands in mine and said with a gentle modesty,\nwhich was all tenderness in fact, and all wifely in promise:\n\n\"Be it as you will, Archie! I am all yours in heart now; and I am ready\nto go through the ceremony when you will.\"\n\n\"Remember, dear\" I protested \"it is only on your account, and to try\nto meet your wishes at any sacrifice, that I suggested the interval\nof comradeship. As far as I am concerned I want to go straight to the\naltar--the real altar--now.\" Up went her warning finger as she said\nlovingly:\n\n\"I know all that dear; and I shall remember it when the time comes. But\nwhat have we to do to prepare for--for the wedding. Is it to be in a\nchurch or at a registry. I suppose it doesn't matter which under the\ncircumstances--and as we are to have the real marriage later. When do\nyou wish it to be, and where?\"\n\n\"To-morrow!\" She started slightly as she murmured:\n\n\"So soon! I did not think it could be so soon.\"\n\n\"The sooner the better\" said I \"If we are to carry out our plans. All's\nready; see here\" I handed her the license which she read with glad eyes\nand a sweet blush. When she had come to the end of it I said:\n\n\"I have arranged with the clergyman of St. Hilda's Church in Carlisle to\nbe ready at eight o'clock to-morrow morning.\" She sat silent a while and\nthen asked me:\n\n\"And how do you suggest that I am to get there without the detectives\nseeing me?\"\n\n\"That is to be our experiment as to escape. I would propose that you\nshould slip out in some disguise. You will of course have to arrange\nwith Mrs. Jack, and at least one servant, to pretend that you are still\nat home. Why not let it be understood that you have a headache and are\nkeeping your room. Your meals can be taken to you as would be done, and\nthe life of the household seem to go on just as usual.\"\n\n\"And what disguise had you thought of?\"\n\n\"I thought that if you went dressed as a man it would be best.\"\n\n\"Oh that would be a lark!\" she said. Then her face fell. \"But where am\nI to get a man's dress? There is not time if I am to be in Carlisle\nto-morrow morning.\"\n\n\"Be easy as to that, dear. A man's dress is on its way to you now by\npost. It should be here by now. I am afraid you will have to take chance\nas to its fit. It is of pretty thick cloth, however, so that it will\nlook all right.\"\n\n\"What sort of dress is it?\"\n\n\"A servant's, a footman's. I thought it would probably avoid suspicion\neasier than any other.\"\n\n\"That goes! Oh this is too thrilling;\" she stopped suddenly and said:\n\n\"But how about Mrs. Jack?\"\n\n\"She will go early this afternoon to Carlisle and put up at a little\nhotel out of the way. I have got rooms in one close to the station. At\nfirst I feared it would not be possible for her to be with us; but then\nwhen I thought it over, I came to the conclusion that you might not care\nto let the matter come off at all unless she were present. And besides\nyou would want her to be with you to-night when you are in a strange\nplace.\" Again she asked after another pause of thought:\n\n\"But how am I to change my clothes? I can't be married as a footman; and\nI can't go to a strange hotel as one, and come out as a young lady.\"\n\n\"That is all thought out. When you leave here you will find me waiting\nfor you with a bicycle in the wood on the road to Ellon. You will have\nto start about half past five. No one will notice that you are using a\nlady's wheel. You will come to Whinnyfold where you will find a skirt\nand jacket and cap. They are the best I could get. We shall ride into\nAberdeen as by that means we shall minimise the chance of being seen.\nThere we will catch the eight train to Carlisle where we shall arrive\nabout a quarter to two. Mrs. Jack will be there ready for you and will\nhave the dress you will want to-morrow.\"\n\n\"Oh, poor dear won't she be flustered and mystified! How lucky it is\nthat she likes you, and is satisfied with you; otherwise I am afraid she\nwould never agree to such precipitancy. But hold on a minute! Won't it\nlook odd to our outside friends on the watch if a footman goes out and\ndoesn't return.\"\n\n\"You will return to-morrow late in the evening. Mrs. Jack will be home\nby then; she must arrange to keep the servants busy in some distant\npart of the house, so that you can come in unobserved. Besides, the\ndetectives have to divide their watches; the same men will not be on\nduty I take it. Anyhow, if they do not consider the outgoing of a\nfootman as sufficiently important to follow him up they will not trouble\nmuch about his incoming.\"\n\nThis all seemed feasible to Marjory; so we talked the matter over and\narranged a hundred little details. These things she wrote down for Mrs.\nJack's enlightenment, and to aid her memory when she would be alone to\ncarry out the plans as arranged.\n\nMrs. Jack was a little hard to convince; but at last she came round. She\npersisted to almost the end of our interview in saying that she could\nnot understand the necessity for either the hurry or the mystery. She\nwas only convinced when at last Marjory said:\n\n\"Do you want us to have all the Chicago worry over again, dear? You\napprove of my marrying Archie do you not? Well, I had such a sickener of\nproposals and all about it, that if I can't marry this way now, I won't\nmarry at all. My dear, I want to marry Archie; you know we love each\nother.\"\n\n\"Ah, that I do, my dears!\"\n\n\"Well then you must help us; and bear with all our secrecy for a bit;\nwon't you dear?\"\n\n\"That I will, my child!\" she said wiping tears from the corners of her\neyes.\n\nSo it was all settled.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI\n\nA WHOLE WEDDING DAY\n\n\nFortune favoured us admirably in our plans. Mrs. Jack, taking only her\ndressing bag and a few odd parcels, went by the afternoon train from\nEllon to Aberdeen. In hearing of the household she regretted that she\nhad to go alone, as Miss Marjory was unable to leave her room. About\nfive o'clock I was in the wood as appointed; and in about half an hour\nMarjory joined me in her footman's livery. I had a flannel coat in my\nbag which we exchanged for that which she wore and which we hid in the\nwood. We were thus less noticeable. We reached Whinnyfold a little after\nsix, and Marjory went into the house and changed her dress which was\nleft ready. She was not long; and we were soon flying on our road to\nAberdeen. We arrived a little before eight and caught the mail; arriving\nat Carlisle at ten minutes to two o'clock. In the hotel we found Mrs.\nJack anxiously awaiting us.\n\nIn the early morning we were ready; and at eight o'clock we all went\ntogether to St. Hilda's Church, where the clergyman was waiting as had\nbeen arranged. All formalities were gone through and Marjory and I\nwere made one. She looked oh! so sweet in her plain white frock; and\nher manner was gentle and solemn. It all seemed to me like a dream of\ninfinite happiness; from which every instant I feared I should wake, and\nfind in its stead some grim reality of pain, or terror, or unutterable\ncommonplace.\n\nWhen we went back to breakfast at the hotel, we did not even go through\nthe form of regarding it as in any way a wedding feast. Marjory and I\nhad each our part to play, and we determined--I certainly did--to play\nit well. Mrs. Jack had been carefully coached by Marjory as to how she\nshould behave; and though now and again she looked from one to the other\nof us wistfully, she did not make any remark.\n\nAfter a little shopping we got the 12:53 train, arriving at Aberdeen at\n6:20. Mrs. Jack was to go on by the 7 train to Ellon where the carriage\nwas to meet her. My wife and I got our bicycles and rode to Whinnyfold\nby Newburgh and Kirkton so as to avoid observation. When she had changed\nher clothes in our own house, we started for Crom. In the wood she\nchanged her coat and left her bicycle.\n\nBefore we parted she gave me a kiss and a hug that made my blood tingle.\n\n\"You have been good\" she said \"and that is for my husband!\" Once again\nshe held up that warning finger which I had come to know so well, and\nslipped away. She then went on alone to the Castle, whilst I waited in\nnervous expectancy of hearing the whistle which she was to blow in case\nof emergency. Then I rode home like a man in a dream.\n\nI left my bicycle at the hotel, and after some supper walked by\nthe sands to Whinnyfold, stopping to linger at each spot which was\nassociated with my wife. My wife! it was almost too much to think of; I\ncould hardly realise as yet that it was all real. As I sat on the Sand\nCraigs I almost fancied I could see Marjory's figure once again on the\nlonely rock. It seemed so long ago, for so much had happened since then.\n\nAnd yet it was but a few days, all told, since we had first met. Things\nhad gone in a whirl indeed. There seemed to have been no pause; no room\nfor a pause. And now I was married. Marjory was my wife; mine for good\nor ill, till death did us part. Circumstances seemed to have driven us\nso close together that we seemed not new lovers, not bride and groom,\nbut companions of a lifetime.\n\nAnd yet.... There was Marjory in Crom, compassed round by unknown\ndangers, whilst I, her husband of a few hours, was away in another\nplace, unable even to gaze on her beauty or to hear her voice. Why, it\nwas not like a wedding day or a honeymoon at all. Other husbands instead\nof parting with their wives were able to remain with them, free to come\nand go as they pleased, and to love each other unfettered as they would.\nWhy....\n\nI brought myself up sharp. This was grumbling already, and establishing\na grievance. I, who had myself proposed the state of things to Marjory,\nto my wife. She was my wife; mine against all the rest of the world. My\nlove was with her, and my duty was to her. My heart and soul were in her\nkeeping, and I trusted her to the full. This was not my wedding day in\nthe ordinary sense of the word at all. This was _not_ my honeymoon.\nThose things would come later, when our joy would be unfettered by\ncircumstances. Surely I had reason to rejoice. Already Marjory had\ncalled me her husband, she had kissed me as such; the sweetness of her\nkiss was still tingling on my lips. If anything but love and trust could\ncome to me from sitting still and sentimentalising and brooding, then\nthe sooner I started in to do some active work the better!...\n\nI rose straightway and went across the headland to my house, unpacked\nthe box of tools which had come from Aberdeen, and set about my task of\ntrying to make an opening into the cave.\n\nI chose for various reasons the cellar as the spot at which to make the\nfirst attempt. In the first place it was already dug down to a certain\ndepth, so that the labour would be less; and in the second, my working\ncould be kept more secret. In clearing the foundations of the house the\nworkmen had gone down to the rock nearly all round. Just at the end of\nWitsennan point there seemed to be a sort of bowl-like hollow, where\nthe thin skin of earth lay deeper than elsewhere. It was here that the\ncellar was dug out, and the labour of cutting or blasting the rock\nsaved. With a pick-axe I broke and stripped away a large patch of the\nconcrete in the centre of the cellar, and in a short time had dug and\nshovelled away the earth and sand which lay between the floor level and\nthe bed rock. I cleared away till the rock was bare some four or five\nfeet square, before I commenced to work on it. I laboured furiously.\nWhat I wanted was work, active work which would tire my muscles and keep\nmy thoughts from working into channels of gloom and disintegration.\n\nIt took me some time to get into the way of using the tools. It is all\nvery well in theory for a prisoner to get out of a jail or a fortress by\nthe aid of a bit of scrap iron. Let any one try it in real life; under\nthe most favourable conditions, and with the best tools available, he\nwill come to the conclusion that romancing is easy work. I had the very\nlatest American devices, including a bit-and-brace which one could lean\non and work without stooping, and diamond patent drills which could,\ncompared with ordinary tools of the old pattern, eat their way into\nrock at an incredible rate. My ground was on the gneiss side of the\ngeological division. Had it been on the granite side of the line my\nlabour and its rapidity might have been different.\n\nI worked away hour after hour, and fatigue seemed to come and go. I was\nnot sleepy, and there was a feverish eagerness on me which would not let\nme rest. When I paused to ease my muscles cramped with work, thought\ncame back to me of how different this night might have been.... And then\nI set furiously to work again. At last I took no heed of the flying\nhours; and was only recalled to time by the flickering of my lamp, which\nwas beginning to go out. When I stood up from my task, I was annoyed to\nsee how little I had done. A layer of rock of a few inches deep had been\nremoved; and that was all.\n\nWhen I went up the steps after locking the cellar door behind me and\ntaking away the key, I saw the grey light of dawn stealing in through\nthe windows. Somewhere in the village a cock crew. As I stepped out of\nthe door to return home, the east began to quicken with coming day. My\nwedding night had passed.\n\nAs I went back to Cruden across the sands my heart went out in love\nwithout alloy to my absent wife; and the first red bolt of dawn over the\nsea saw only hope upon my face.\n\nWhen I got to my room I tumbled into bed, tired beyond measure. In an\ninstant I was asleep, dreaming of my wife and all that had been, and all\nthat was to be.\n\nMarjory had arranged that she and Mrs. Jack were for the coming week at\nleast, to come over to Cruden every day, and lunch at the hotel; for my\nwife had set her heart on learning to swim. I was to be her teacher, and\nI was enthusiastic about the scheme. She was an apt pupil; and she was\nstrong and graceful, and already skilled in several other physical\naccomplishments, we both found it easy work. The training which she had\nalready had, made a new accomplishment easy. Before the week was over\nshe was able to get along so well, that only practice was needed to make\nher a good swimmer. All this time we met in public as friends, but no\nmore; we were scrupulously careful that no one should notice even an\nintimacy between us. When we were alone, which was seldom and never for\nlong, we were good comrades as before; and I did not venture to make\nlove in any way. At first it was hard to refrain, for I was wildly\nin love with my wife; but I controlled myself in accordance with my\npromise. I soon began to have a dawning feeling that this very obedience\nwas my best means to the end I wished for. Marjory grew to have such\nconfidence in me that she could be more demonstrative than before, and\nI got a larger share of affection than I expected. Besides I could see\nwith a joy unspeakable that her love for me was growing day by day; the\ntentative comradeship--without prejudice--was wearing thin!\n\nAll this week, whilst Marjory was not near, I worked in the cellar at\nWhinnyfold. As I became more expert with the tools, I made greater\nprogress, and the hole in the rock was becoming of some importance.\nOne day on coming out after a spell of afternoon work, I found Gormala\nseated on a stone against the corner of the house. She looked at me\nfixedly and said:\n\n\"Be yon a grave that ye thole?\" The question staggered me. I did not\nknow that any one suspected that I was working in the house, or even\nthat I visited it so often as I did. Besides, it did not suit my purpose\nthat any one should be aware, under any circumstances, that I was\ndigging a hole. I thought for a moment before answering her:\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"Eh! but I'm thinkin' ye ken weel eneuch. I'm no to be deceived i' the\nsoond. I've heard ower mony a time the chip o' the pick, not to ken it\nthough there be walls atween. I wondered why ye came by yer lanes to\nthis dreary hoose when ye sent yon bonnie lassie back to her hame. Aye\nshe is bonnie though her pride be cruel to the aud. Ah, weel! The Fates\nare workin' to their end, whatsoe'er it may be. I maun watch, so that I\nmay be nigh when the end cometh!\"\n\nThere was no use arguing with her; and besides anything that I could say\nwould only increase her suspicion. Suspicion abroad about my present\ntask was the last thing I wished for.\n\nShe was round about the headland the next morning, and the next, and the\nnext. During the day I never saw her; but at night she was generally to\nbe found on the cliff above the Reivie o'Pircappies. I was glad of one\nthing; she did not seem to suspect that I was working all the time. Once\nI asked her what she was waiting for; she answered without looking at\nme:\n\n\"In the dark will be a struggle in the tide-race, and a shrood floatin'\nin the air! When next death an' the moon an' the tide be in ane, the\nseein' o' the Mystery o' the Sea may be mine!\"\n\nIt made me cold to hear her. This is what she foretold of Marjory; and\nshe was waiting to see her prophecy come to pass.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII\n\nENTRANCE TO THE CAVERN\n\n\nOne night, when I had got down a considerable depth into the rock, I\ntook the pick to loosen out some stone which I had drilled. As I struck,\nthe sound of the rock was hollower than I had before noticed. My heart\nleaped into my mouth, and I had to pause. Then I struck again harder,\nand the sound was more hollow still. Whether or no it was the place I\nwas looking for, there was some cave in the rock below me. I would have\ngone on working straightway had there been anyone with me; but being\nalone I had to be careful. I was now standing on, evidently, only a\nlayer of rock, over an opening of whose depth I was in ignorance. Should\nthis piece of stone break away, as was quite possible from my working\non it, I might be precipitated into a living tomb. The very secrecy in\nwhich I had kept my work, might tend to insure my death. Therefore I\nmade all preparation for such a casualty. Henceforth I worked with round\nmy waist a short rope the other end of which was fastened to a heavy\nstaple in the wall. Even if the rock should give way underneath me, a\nfoot or two would limit my fall. This precaution taken, I worked more\nfuriously than ever. With a large hammer I struck the rock at the bottom\nof the shaft, again and again, with all my might. Then I heard a dull\nsound of something rattling below me; the top of the cave was falling\nin. I redoubled my efforts; and all at once a whole mass of rock sunk\nbeneath my hammer and disappeared into a black chasm which sent up\na whiff of cold air. I had seized my rope to scramble out, fearing\nasphyxiation; but when I smelled salt water I did not fear. Then I knew\nthat I had got an opening into a sea cave of some sort. I stuck to my\nwork till I had hammered an irregular hole some three feet square. Then\nI came up to rest and think. I lowered a rope with a stone at the end,\nand found that the depth was some thirty feet. The stone had gone into\nwater before it touched bottom. I could hear the \"plop\" as it struck the\nsurface. As I thought it better not to descend by myself, lest there\nshould be any danger of returning, I spent the rest of my stay for that\nevening in rigging up a pulley in the roof over the hole so that I might\nbe lowered down when the time should come. Then I went home, for I\nfeared lest the fascinating temptation to make the descent at once would\novercome me.\n\nAfter breakfast I rode over to Crom, and when I was alone with Marjory\ntold her of my discovery. She was wild with excitement, and I rejoiced\nto find that this new pleasure drew us even closer together. We agreed\nthat she should come to help me; it would not do to take any one else\ninto our confidence, and she would not hear of my going down into the\ncave alone. In order to avoid comment we thought it better that she\nshould come late in the evening. The cave being dark, it was of course\nimmaterial whether day or night was appointed for the experiment. Then\nit was, I could not help it, that I said to her:\n\n\"You see now the wisdom of our being married. We can go where we like;\nand if we should be found out no one can say a word!\" She said nothing;\nthere was nothing to say. We decided that she had better slip out,\nas she had done before, in the footman's dress. I went off and made\npreparation for her coming, bringing in food for supper and plenty of\ncandles and matches and lamps and rope; for we did not know how long the\nexploration might take.\n\nA little before nine o'clock I met her as before in the wood. She\nchanged her livery coat for the flannel one, and we rode off to\nWhinnyfold. We got into the house without being noticed.\n\nWhen I took her down to the cellar and turned into the hole the\nreflector of the strong lamp, she held on to me with a little shiver.\nThe opening did certainly look grim and awesome. The black rock was\nslimy with sea moisture, and the rays of the light were lost far below\nin the gloom. I told her what she would have to do in lowering me down,\nand explained the rude mechanism which I had constructed. She was, I\ncould see, a little nervous with the responsibility; and was anxious to\nknow any detail so thoroughly that no accident of ignorance could occur.\n\nWhen the rope was round me and I was ready to descend, she kissed me\nmore fondly than she had ever done yet, and held on to me as though loth\nto part. As I sank into the opening, holding the gasoline bicycle lamp\nwhich I had elected to take with me, I saw her pretty forehead wrinkled\nup in anxiety as she gave all her mind to the paying out of the rope.\nEven then I was delighted with the ease and poise of her beautiful\nfigure, fully shown in the man's dress which she had not changed, as it\nwas so suitable for the work she had to do.\n\nWhen I had been lowered some twenty feet, I turned my lantern down and\nsaw through the sheen of water a bottom of rock with here and there\na cluster of loose stones; one big slab which stuck up endwise, was\nevidently that which had fallen from the roof under my hammer. It was\nmanifest that there was, in this part of the cave at any rate, not\nsufficient water to make it a matter of any concern. I called to Marjory\nto lower slowly, and a few seconds later I stood in the cave, with the\nwater just above my knees. I moved the new-fallen slab to one side lest\nit might injure any one who was descending. Then I took the strong rope\nfrom me, and knotted round my waist the end of the thin rope which I\nhad brought for the purpose. This formed a clue, in case such should be\nnecessary, and established a communication with Marjory which would tend\nto allay her anxiety. With the cord running through her fingers, she\nwould know I was all right. I went cautiously through the cave, feeling\nmy way carefully with the long stick which I had brought with me. When I\nhad got some distance I heard Marjory's voice echoing through the cave:\n\n\"Take care there are no octopuses!\" She had been thinking of all sorts\nof possible dangers. For my own part the idea of an octopus in the cave\nnever crossed my mind. It was a disconcerting addition to my anxieties;\nbut there was nothing to do. I was not going to abandon my project for\nthis fear; and so I went on.\n\nFurther inland the cave shelved down on one side, following the line of\nthe rock so that I passed through an angular space which, though wide\nin reality, seemed narrow by comparison with the wide and lofty chamber\ninto which I had descended. A little beyond this again, the rock dipped,\nso that only a low tunnel, some four feet high, rose above the water. I\nwent on, carefully feeling my way, and found that the cave ended in a\npoint or narrow crevice.\n\nAll this time I had been thinking that the appearance of the place did\nnot quite tally with the description in de Escoban's narrative. No\nmention had been made of any such difficulties; as the few men had\ncarried in what must have been of considerable bulk and weight there\nwould have been great difficulties for them.\n\nSo I retraced my steps, intending to see if there was any other branch\nnearer to the sea. I kept the line taut so that Marjory might not be\nalarmed. I think I was as glad as she was when I saw the light through\nthe opening, and the black circle of her head as she looked down\neagerly. When underneath, I told her of my adventure, and then turned\nseawards to follow the cave down. The floor here was more even, as\nthough it had been worn smooth by sea wash and the endless rolling of\npebbles. The water deepened only a few inches in all. As I went, I threw\nthe rays of my lamp around, anxiously looking for some opening. The\nwhole distance from the place where I had made the entry to the face\nof the cliff was not very great; but distance in the open seems very\ndifferent from that within an unknown cavern. Presently I came to a\nplace where the floor of the cave was strewn with stones, which grew\nbigger and more as I went on; till at last I was climbing up a rising\npile of rocks. It was slippery work, for there seemed some kind of ooze\nor slime over the stones which made progress difficult. When I had\nclimbed up about half way towards the roof, I noticed that on my left\nside the slope began to fall away. I moved over and raising my lamp saw\nto my inexpressible joy that there was an opening in the rock. Getting\nclose I found that though it was nearly blocked with stones there was\nstill a space large enough to creep through. Also with pleasure I saw\nthat the stones here were small. With a very slight effort I dislodged\nsome of them and sent them rolling down, thus clearing the way. The\nclatter of the stones evidently alarmed Marjory for I heard her calling\nto me. I hurried back under the opening--the way seemed easy enough now\nI knew it--and told her of my fresh discovery.\n\nThen I went back again and climbed down the slope of fallen stones; this\nwas evidently the debris of the explosion which had choked the mouth of\nthe cave. The new passage trended away a little to the right, making a\nsharp angle with the cave I had left. Then after deflecting to the left\nit went on almost straight for a considerable distance, thus lying, as\nI made it out, almost parallel to the first cave. I had very little\nanxiety as to the safety of the way. The floor seemed more level than\neven that of the entrance to the first cave. There was a couple of feet\nof water in the deepest part, but not more; it would not have been\ndifficult to carry the treasure here. About two hundred feet in, the\ncave forked, one arm bending slightly to the left and the other to the\nright. I tried the former way and came to a sheer dip in the rock such\nas I had met with before. Accordingly I came back and tried the second.\nWhen I had gone on a little way, I found my line running out; so I went\nback and asked Marjory to throw me down the end. I was so sure of the\nroad now that I did not need a clue. At first she demurred, but I\nconvinced her; taking the rope I fixed one end of it within the cave\nbefore it branched. Then I started afresh on my way, carrying the coil\nof rope with me.\n\nThis branch of the cave went on crookedly with occasionally strange\nangles and sharp curves. Here and there, on one side or the other and\nsometimes on both, the rock walls bellied out, making queer chambers or\nrecesses, or narrowing the cave to an aperture only a few feet wide. The\nroof too was raised or fell in places, so that I had now and again to\nbend my head and even to stoop; whilst at other times I stood under a\nsort of high dome. In such a zigzag course I lost my bearings somewhat;\nbut I had an idea that the general tendency was inland to the right.\nStrange to say, the floor of the cave remained nearly level. Here again,\nages of tide and rolling pebbles had done their work effectively. My\ncord ran out again and I had to lose the far end and bring it on, fixing\nit afresh, as I did not like to proceed without keeping a clue behind\nme. Somewhat further on, the cave dipped and narrowed so that I had to\nbend nearly double to pass, my face being just above the water as I\nwent. It was with difficulty that I kept the lamp from touching the\nwater below or knocking against the rock above. I was much chagrined to\nfind this change in the structure of the cave, for since I had entered\non this branch of it I had completely made up my mind that I was on the\nright road and that only a short time and a little distance lay between\nme and the treasure. However there was nothing to do but to go on.\n\nA few feet more and the roof began to rise; at first in a very gentle\nslope, but then suddenly. Stretching my cramped back and raising my\nhead, I looked around. I raised my lamp high, turning it so that its\nrays might let me take in a wide circle.\n\nI stood at the side of a large, lofty cave, quaint of outline, with here\nand there smooth walls from which great masses of red rock projected\nominously. So threatening did these overhanging masses look, that for a\nfew seconds I feared to stir lest some of them should topple over on me.\nThen, when my eyes had become accustomed to the greater glare, I saw\nthat they were simply masses of the rugged rock itself. The whole cave,\nso far as I could see, was red granite, formed of the great rock flung\nupward in the pristine upheaval which had placed the Skares in the sea.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII\n\nVOICES IN THE DARK\n\n\nI looked round the cave with mingled feelings. The place itself was,\nas a natural wonder, superb; but to me as a treasure hunter it was a\ndisappointment. In no way did it answer the description of Don de\nEscoban. However I did not despair; there were many openings, and some\none of them might bring me to the required spot. I passed to the centre\nof the cavern and looked round. As I did so, I got a momentary fright,\nfor several of the openings were so much alike that only for my rope I\nwould not have been able to distinguish that by which I had come in. The\nlesson of this shock should not be lost; I must make a mark by which I\ncould distinguish this entrance from the others. No matter where the\nother openings might lead to, this alone, so far as I could tell, was\nthe one which could lead me to safety. With a heavy pebble I hammered\naway at the right side of the entrance till I had chipped off a piece of\nrock. I could tell this place again by sight or by touch. Then I went\nround the cave examining the various branches. It was here that I began\nto feel the disadvantage of my imperfect light. I wanted some kind of\ntorch which would give sufficient light to see the whole place at once.\nOne could get no fit idea of proportion by merely making the little\npatch of dim light from the bicycle lamp travel along the rocky walls.\nI felt that all this time Marjory must be anxious about me, doubly so\nsince she had no clue to where I had gone. So I determined to come back\nat once, and postpone the thorough examination of the place until I\nshould have proper appliances. Accordingly I made my way back to the\nplace where Marjory anxiously awaited me.\n\nHer reception of me was sweet and tender. It was so natural that its\nforce was hardly manifest. It may have been that my mind was so full of\nmany things that I did not receive her caress with the same singleness\nof devotion as was my wont. Now that I was assured of her love for me,\nand since I had called her my wife, my love lost its element of anxiety.\nIt is this security which marks the difference of a husband's love\nfrom that of a lover; doubt is an element of passion, but not of true\nconjugal love. It was only afterwards, when I was alone, and Marjory's\nenchanting presence was not with me, that I began to realise through\nthe lenses of memory and imagination the full sweetness of my wife's\ngreeting in her joy at the assurance of my safety. It took a very\nfew moments to tell her all the details of my adventure, and of the\nconclusion which I had come to as to the need for postponement. She\nthoroughly agreed with me in the necessity; and we then and there\nsettled that it would be wiser for her to go back to Crom to-night. We\nwere to settle later, when all preparations had been made, when we\nshould again attempt the investigation of the cave.\n\nWhen I had put on dry clothes, we set out for Crom. We walked our\nbicycles past Whinnyfold, and were grateful for the unique peculiarity\nof that village, an absence of dogs. We did not light our lamps till we\ngot on the Peterhead road; and we put them out when we got into the\nmesh of crossroads near Crom. In the wood Marjory once more resumed her\nfootman's coat, and we set out for the castle. On our way we had agreed\nthat it would be best to try the other side of the castle where it was\nnot likely that any stranger would attempt to approach, as there was\nonly the mossy foot track through the wood by the old chapel. In the\nlater days both Marjory and I had used our opportunities of finding new\npaths through the wood round the castle; and we had already marked down\nseveral tracks which we could follow even in the dark with a little\ncare. This was almost a necessity, as we had noticed of late traces of\nthe watchers round the main gateway through which all in the castle were\naccustomed to come and go.\n\nThe path which we took to-night required a long detour of the wood, as\nit lay right on the other side from the entrance gate. It was only a\nnarrow grass path, beginning between two big trees which stood closely\ntogether not very far from one of the flanking mounds or hillocks which\nhere came closer down to the castle than any of the others. The path\nwound in and out among the tree trunks, till finally it debouched at the\nback of the old chapel which stood on a rising rock, hidden in the wood,\nsome three hundred feet from the west side of the castle. It was a\nvery old chapel, partly in ruins and antedating the castle by so many\ncenturies that it was manifestly a relic of the older castle on whose\nsite Crom was built. It may have been used for service early in the\nsixteenth century; but it could not even have been in repair, or even\nweather-proof, for there were breaches at the end of it in which had\ntaken root seedlings which were now forest trees. There was one old oak\nwhose girth and whose gnarled appearance could not have been achieved\nwithin two centuries. Not merely the roots but the very trunk and\nbranches had pushed aside the great stones which lay firmly and\nmassively across the long low windows peculiar to the place. These\nwindows were mere longitudinal slits in the wall, a sort of organised\ninterstices between great masses of stone. Each of the three on either\nside of the chapel was about two feet high and some six feet in length;\none stone support, irregularly placed, broke the length of each. There\nwas some kind of superstition amongst the servants regarding this place.\nNone of them would under any circumstances go near it at night; and not\neven in daytime if they could decently excuse themselves.\n\nIn front of the chapel the way was very much wider. Originally there had\nbeen a clear space leading through the wood: but centuries of neglect\nhad done their work. From fallen pine-cone, and beech-mast, and acorn,\nhere and there a tree had grown which now made of the original broad\nalleyway a number of tortuous paths between the towering trunks. One\nof the reasons why we had determined to use this path was that it was\nnoiseless. Grass and moss and rusty heaps of pine needles betrayed no\nfootfall; with care one could come and go unheard. If once she could get\nthrough the wood unnoticed, Marjory might steal up to the doorway in the\nshadow of the castle and let herself in, unobserved.\n\nWe went hand in hand slowly and cautiously, hardly daring to breathe;\nand after a time that seemed endless came out at the back of the chapel.\nThen we stole quietly along by the southern wall. As we passed the first\nwindow, Marjory who was ahead of me stopped and gripped my hand so hard\nthat I knew there must be some good cause for her agitation. She pressed\nback so that we both stood away from the window opening which we could\njust see dimly outlined on the granite wall, the black vacancy showing\nagainst the lichen-covered stone. Putting her lips close to my ear she\nwhispered:\n\n\"There are people there. I heard them talking!\" My blood began to run\ncold. In an instant all the danger in which Marjory stood rushed back\nupon me. Of late we had been immune from trouble, so that danger which\nwe did not know of seemed to stand far off; but now the place and the\nhour, the very reputation of the old chapel, all sent back in a flood\nthe fearful imaginings which had assailed me since first I had known of\nthe plot against Marjory. Instinctively my first act was to draw my wife\nclose to me and hold her tight. Even in that moment it was a joy to me\nto feel that she let herself come willingly. For a few moments we stood\nsilent, with our hearts beating together; then she whispered to me\nagain:\n\n\"We must listen. We may perhaps find out who they are, and what they\nintend.\"\n\nAccordingly we drew again close to the opening, Marjory standing under\nthe aperture, and I beside it as I found I could hear better in this\nposition. The stooping made the coursing of my own blood sound in my\nears. The voice which we first heard was a strong one, for even when\ntoned to a whisper it was resonant as well as harsh and raucous:\n\n\"Then it's settled we wait till we get word from Whiskey Tommy. How long\nis it likely to be?\" The answering voice, also a whisper, was smooth and\noily, but penetrating:\n\n\"Can't say. He has to square the Dutchy: and they take a lot of sugar,\nhis kind. They're mighty pious when they're right end up; but Lordy!\nwhen they're down they're holy terrors. This one is a peach. But he's\nclever--I will say that; and he knows it. I'm almost sorry we took him\nin now, though he is so clever. He'd better mind out, though, for none\nof us love him; and if he goes back on us, or does not come up to the\nmark--\" He stopped, and the sentence was finished by a click which I\nknew was the snapping of the spring of a bowie knife when it is thrown\nopen.\n\n\"And quite right too. I'm on if need be!\" and there was another click.\nThe answering voice was strong and resolute, but somehow, for all the\nwicked intent spoken, it did not sound so evil as the other. I looked\nat Marjory, and saw through the darkness that her eyes were blazing. My\nheart leaped again; the old pioneer spirit was awake in her, and somehow\nmy dread for her was not the same. She drew close to me and whispered\nagain:\n\n\"Be ready to get behind the trees at the back, I hear them rising.\" She\nwas evidently right, for now the voices were easier to hear since the\nmouths of the speakers were level with the window. A voice, a new one,\nsaid:\n\n\"We must git now. Them boys of Mac's 'll be on their round soon.\" With\na quick movement Marjory doubled under the window and came to me. She\nwhispered as before:\n\n\"Let us get behind trees in front. We may see them coming through the\ndoor, and it will be well to know them.\" So motioning to her to go on\nthe side we were on, I slipped round the back, and turning by the other\nside of the chapel, and taking care to duck under the windows, hid\nmyself behind one of the great oak trees in front, to the north of the\noriginal clearing. From where I stood I could see Marjory behind a tree\nacross the glade. From where we were we could see any one who left\nthe chapel; for one or other of us commanded the windows, and we both\ncommanded the ruined doorway. We waited, and waited, and waited, afraid\nto stir hand or foot lest we should give a warning to our foes. The time\nseemed interminable; but no one came out and we waited on, not daring to\nstir.\n\nPresently I became conscious of two forms stealing between the trees up\ntowards the chapel. I glided further round behind my sheltering tree,\nand, throwing an anxious glance toward Marjory, was rejoiced to see that\nshe was doing the same. Closer and closer the two forms came. There was\nnot the faintest sound from them. Approaching the door-way from either\nside they peered in, listened, and then stole into the darkness between\nthe tree trunks which marked the breach in the wall. I ventured out and\nslipped behind a tree somewhat nearer; Marjory on her side did the same,\nand at last we stood behind the two nearest trees and could both note\nthe doorway and each of us the windows on one side. Then there was a\nwhisper from within; somehow I expected to hear a pistol shot or to see\na rush of men out through the jagged black of the doorway. Still nothing\nhappened. Then a match was struck within. In the flash I could see the\nface of the man who had made the light--the keen-eyed messenger of Sam\nAdams. He held up the light, and to our amazement we could see that,\nexcept for the two men whom we had seen go in, the chapel was empty.\n\nMarjory flitted over to me and whispered:\n\n\"Don't be afraid. Men who light up like that aren't likely to stumble\nover us, if we are decently careful.\" She was right. The two men, seeing\nthat the place was empty, seemed to cast aside their caution. They came\nout without much listening, stole behind the chapel, and set off along\nthe narrow pathway through the wood. Marjory whispered to me:\n\n\"Now is my chance to get in before they come back. You may come with me\nto the edge of the wood. When I get in, dear, go back home as fast as\nyou can. You must be tired and want rest. Come to-morrow as soon as you\ncan. We have lots to talk over. That chapel must be seen to. There is\nsome mystery there which is bigger than anything we have struck yet.\nIt's no use going into it now; it wants time and thinking over!\" We were\nwhispering as we walked along, still keeping carefully in the shadow of\nthe trees. Behind the last tree Marjory kissed me. It was her own act,\nand as impulsively I clasped her tight in my arms, she nestled in to me\nas though she felt that she belonged there. With a mutual 'good-night'\nand a whispered blessing she stole away into the shadow. I saw her reach\nthe door and disappear through it.\n\nI went back to Cruden with my mind in a whirl of thoughts and feelings.\nAmongst them love was first; with all the unspeakable joy which comes\nwith love that is returned.\n\nI felt that I had a right to call Marjory my very own now. Our dangers\nand hopes and sympathies made a tie which seemed even closer than that\ntied in the church at Carlisle.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIX\n\nTHE MONUMENT\n\n\nFor the remainder of that night, whether rushing home on my bicycle,\npreparing for rest, lying awake, or even in my sleep, I thought over\nthe mystery of the disappearance of the speakers in the old chapel.\nCertainly I went to sleep on the thought, and woke with it. It never\nleft me even after breakfast as I rode out towards Crom. It was manifest\nthat there must be some secret vault or hiding place in the chapel; or\nit might be that there was some subterranean passage. If the latter,\nwhere did it lead to? Where else, unless to the castle; such would be\nthe natural inference. The very thought made my blood run cold; it was\nno wonder that it overspread my mind to the exclusion of all else. In\nsuch case Marjory's enemies were indeed dangerous, since they held a\nsecret way to her at all times; once within the castle it would not be\nhard to work evil to her.\n\nI thought that this morning I would do a little prospecting on my own\naccount. Accordingly I left my bicycle in the wood and went a long\ncircuit, keeping in the shadow of the woods where possible, and\nelsewhere stealing behind the hedgerows, till I got to the far side of\nthe hill or spur which came nearest to the old chapel. This was one of\nthe hills up whose base the trees ran in flame-shaped patches. Half way\nup, the woods ceased, and there was a belt of barrenness--outcropping\nrock fringed with green grass. The top, like most of the hills or\nmounds around the castle, was covered with woods, close-growing masses\nof pine which made a dusk even in the noonday.\n\nI took my way up the back of the hill and stole through the wood,\ncarefully keeping a watchful look out all round me, for I feared the\npresence of either of the sets of spies. At the very top I came upon a\ngood sized circle of masonry, low but heavily built of massive stones\ncompletely covered with rich green lichen. The circle was some fifteen\nfeet diameter, and the top was slightly arched as though forming a\nroof. Leaning over it I could hear a faint trickle of water; this was\nevidently the source of the castle supply.\n\nI walked round it, examining it carefully; anything which had any direct\ncommunication with the castle was at present of possibly the supremest\nimportance. There was no flaw or opening anywhere; and from the unbroken\ncovering of the stones by the lichen, it was apparent that there had\nbeen no disturbance for years.\n\nI sat down on the edge of the stonework and for a long time thought over\nmatters of probability. If underneath me, as was almost to be taken\nfor granted, lay the reservoir of the castle, it must have been made\ncoevally with Crom itself, or even with the older castle on whose\nruins it was built. It must be fed by springs in the rock which formed\nthe base of the hill and cropped out all over it; and if it was not\napproachable from without, there must be some way of reaching the water\nfrom within. It might be that the chamber which contained the reservoir\nhad some other entrance from the hill top, or from some lower level.\nAccordingly I made as I conceived a bee line for the castle, till I\ncame to the very base of the hill, for I knew that in matters of water\nconduit the direct way is always chosen where work has to be done. As\nI went, I conned the ground carefully; not merely the surface for that\nwas an uniform thick coating of brown pine needles, but the general\nconformation. Where a trench has been made, there is ever after some\ntrace of it to be found. Even if the workmen level the trench most\ncarefully there and then, the percolation of rain through the softer\nbroken earth will make discovery of the change by shrinkage. Here,\nhowever, there was no such sign; the ground, so far as one could judge,\nhad never been opened. The trees grew irregularly, and there was no gap\nsuch as would be, had one ever been removed. Here and there particles of\nrock cropped out amongst the pine needles just as anywhere else. If any\nopening existed it was not on the direct line between the reservoir and\nthe castle.\n\nBack again I went to the reservoir, and, using it as a base, began to\ncast around for some opening or sign. I made circles in all directions,\njust as a retriever does when looking for a fallen partridge in a dry\nstubble when the scent is killed by heat.\n\nAt last I came upon something, though whether or no it might have any\npoint of contact with my purpose, I could not at once decide. It was a\nrude monument of some kind, a boulder placed endwise on a slab of rock\nroughly hewn to form a sort of square plinth. This again was surrounded\non the outside, for the whole monument was on the very edge of a\nsteeply-dipping crag, by a few tiers of rough masonry. The stones were\nroughly cut and laid together without mortar; or if mortar or cement\nthere had ever been, time and weather had washed it away. In one respect\nthis structure was in contrast to that above the reservoir, there was\nnot a sign of moss or lichen about it. The trees of the wood came close\nup behind it; in front it was shut out from view below by the branches\nof a few pine trees which grew crookedly from a precarious foothold\namongst the ledges of rock beneath. As I stood in front of it, I could\nsee nothing immediately below me; however, when I had scrambled to a\nledge a few feet lower down, the back wall of the old chapel became\nvisible, though partly obscured by trunks and branches of intervening\ntrees. I searched all over the monument for some inscription, but could\nsee none. Then I stood on the plinth to see if there might be any\ninscription on the top of the boulder. As I stood, looking over the top\nof it from the bank, I could just see through a natural alleyway amongst\nthe tree tops, the top of one corner of the castle, that on the side of,\nand farthest from the old chapel. As I looked, a bright thought struck\nme. Here was a place from which one might correspond with the castle,\nunseen by any one save at the one spot. I determined then and there,\nthat Marjory and I should arrange some method of signalling to one\nanother.\n\nSomehow this place impressed me, possibly because it was the only thing,\nexcept the reservoir, which seemed to have a purpose in the whole scheme\nof the hill top. Where there was labour and manifest purpose, there must\nsurely be some connection. I examined all round the place minutely,\nscrambling down the rocks below and on either side, but always keeping\na bright look out in case of spies. The only thing I noticed was that\nthere seemed a trace of some kind of a pathway through the wood here.\nIt was not sufficiently marked to allow one to accept it with certainty\nas a pathway; but there is something about a place which is even\noccasionally trodden, which marks it from its surroundings virgin of\nfootsteps. I could not find where the path ended or where it began. It\nseemed to grow from the monument, but here underfoot was stone and hard\ngravel; and the wind coming over the steep slope swept the fallen pine\nneedles back amongst the shelter of the trees. After a few hundred yards\nany suggestion of a pathway disappeared, lost in the aisles of the pine\ntrees spreading round on every side. There was no need of a pathway here\nwhere all was open. Once or twice as I searched the thought came to me\nthat there might be some opening here to a secret way or hiding place;\nbut look how I would, I could not find the faintest trace or suggestion\nof any opening. In the end I had to take it that the erection was merely\na monument or mark of some kind, whose original purpose was probably\nlost in time.\n\nAt last, as the day was well on, I made my way back to where my bicycle\nwas hidden, always taking care to keep from observation. Then emerging\non the road, I went as usual through the old ruined gateway and the long\nwinding avenue to the castle.\n\nMarjory met me with an anxious look, and hung on to my arm lovingly as\nshe said:\n\n\"Oh, you are late! I have been quite nervous all the morning lest\nanything should have happened to you!\" Mrs. Jack, after we had greeted,\ndiscreetly left us alone; and I told my wife of all that I had thought\nsince we had parted, and of what I had seen on the hill top. She was\ndelighted at the idea of a means of signalling; and insisted on my\ncoming at once to the roof to make further arrangements and discoveries.\n\nWe found the spot which I had indicated admirably adapted for our\npurpose. One could sit on the stone roof, well back from the wall, and\nthrough one of the openings in the castellation see the top of the\nmonument amongst the tree tops; and could yet be unobserved oneself from\nany other spot around. The angles of the castellation of the various\nwalls shut out the tops of the other hills or mounds on every side.\nAs the signs of our code were already complete we had only to fix on\nsome means of signalling 'A' and 'B'. This we did by deciding that by\ndaylight A should be signified by red and B by white and at night A by\nred and B by green. Thus by daylight two pocket handkerchiefs of red\nand white or two flowers of white and red; or a piece of paper and\na red leaf or flower would suffice. We fixed on colour as the best\nrepresentative, as the distance made simplicity necessary. By night an\nordinary bicycle lamp with the lens covered could be used; the ordinary\nred and green side lights could be shown as required. Then and there we\narranged that that very afternoon when I had left the castle I should\nsteal back to the monument and we should make a trial of our signalling.\n\nThen we talked of other things. Alone there on the roof we could talk\nfreely; and the moments flew swiftly by in a sweet companionship. Even\nif the subjects which we had to discuss were grim ones of danger and\nintrigue; of secret passages and malignant enemies; of spies and\npossibilities of harm to one or both of us, still mutuality of our\ntroubles and dangers made their existence to us sweet. That we shared\nin common even such matters was dear to us both. I could not but be\nconscious of Marjory's growing love for me; and if I had to restrain\nmyself now and again from throwing my arms round her and pressing her\nbeautiful body close to me and sweeping her face with kisses, I was\nrepaid when, as we descended she put both her hands in mine and said:\n\n\"Oh Archie! you are good to me! and--and--I love you so!\" Then she sank\ninto my arms and our mouths met in a long, loving kiss.\n\nWe decided that as there must be some hidden opening in the old chapel,\nwe should make search for it the next day. I was to come soon after\nsunrise, for this we judged would be the time when the spies of both\nkinds would least expect movement from the castle. I was to come by the\ngrass path between the trees into the old chapel where she would meet\nme and we should make our investigations together.\n\nAfter tea I came away. Marjory came out on the steps with me to see me\noff. As we bade each other good-bye she said aloud in case any one might\nbe listening:\n\n\"Remember, you are to come to tea to-morrow and to bring me the book. I\nam quite anxious to know how it ends. It is too bad of the librarian not\nto send us all the volumes at once!\"\n\nWhen I got to the road I hid my bicycle in the old place, and took\nmy way secretly to the monument. Marjory had been much struck by the\nsuggestion of the footpath, and, woman-like, had made up her mind on the\nsubject. She had suggested that we should test whether any one came or\nwent by it, and to this end gave me a spool of the finest thread so that\nI might lay a trap. Before I should leave the place I was to stretch\nthreads across it here and there between the tree trunks. If on the next\nvisit I should find them broken, we might take it that some one had been\nthere.\n\nFrom the top of the boulder I made signal and was immediately answered.\nMy own signal was simply the expression of my heart's feeling:\n\n\"I love you, my wife!\" The answer came quickly back filling me with joy:\n\n\"I love you, my husband! Don't forget me! Think of me!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXX\n\nTHE SECRET PASSAGE\n\n\nThat night was one of rest. I was physically tired out, and after I had\nposted a few letters to merchants in Aberdeen, giving orders for various\ngoods to be sent at once to Whinnyfold, I went to bed and slept till the\nearly morning. I got up at daylight, and after my morning swim rode off\nto Crom. Again I left my bicycle in the wood and took my way round to\nthe back of the hill and up through the wood to the monument beyond the\nreservoir. It was still early morning, as it is counted in the cities,\nthough the sun was well up. I went with extra caution, stealing from\ntree to tree; for I knew nothing of the locality of the watchers at\nthis hour. I saw no sign of anyone; and coming at last to where the\nrudimentary pathway lay, examined carefully where I had placed the first\nthread. As I did so I straightened myself quickly and looked round with\napprehension. The thread was broken across, though the two ends were\ntied where I had placed them!\n\nWith a beating heart I examined all the others in turn, with the same\nresult. It was quite evident that some one, or some thing had passed\nalong the track. In spite of my concern I rejoiced, for something had\nbeen found. It was at least probable that there was a regular route\nsomewhere at hand. Accordingly I prepared my traps afresh, this time\nplacing them in various directions, and at irregular distances along the\npath and all round the monument. I might thus be able to trace the\nexact route of anyone who might disturb them. This done, and it took\nsome time, I went back to the wood, and thence rode to the castle.\n\nMarjory was eager for news, but it thrilled me to see that her eagerness\nwas not all from this cause; hour by hour I found myself growing in her\naffection. When I told her of the broken threads, she clapped her hands\nwith delight; the hunter spirit hereditary in her was pleased. She gave\nher opinion that on the next morning I should be able to locate the\nentrance to the passage, if one there was. In the midst of her speaking\nthus she stopped; a bright, keen light came into her eyes, and her brows\nknitted.\n\n\"Why,\" she said, \"how stupid I am. I never once thought of doing the\nsame at my end. Yesterday, after you left, I spent an hour in the old\nchapel and went over every inch of it; but it never occurred to me to do\nthere what you had gone to do at the monument. If I had done so, I might\nthis morning have been able to discover the secret of the disappearance\nof the kidnappers. I shall take good care to do it this evening.\"\n\nWhile she was speaking a fear grew upon me lest being alone in the ruin\nshe might give her enemies the very opportunity they wanted. She saw my\ndistress, and with her quick woman's wit guessed the cause of it. With\na very tender movement she placed her hand on the back of mine, and\nwithout squeezing it held it there firmly as she said:\n\n\"Don't be frightened for me, dear. These are expert workmen that we are\ndealing with. They won't move till their plans are all ready. They don't\nwish to get hold of me for five minutes and let \"Mac's men\"--as lacking\ndue respect for President McKinley, they call the Secret Service agents\nof my country--catch them red-handed. They are only laying their plans\nas yet. Perhaps we may have cause to be anxious when that is done; but\nas yet it's all right. Anyhow, my dear, as I know it will make you\neasier in your mind, when you are not at hand to protect me, I shall lay\nthe traps whilst you are with me. There now! Am I good to my husband, or\nam I not?\" I made her aware in my own way--I could not help it--that she\nwas good! and she let the incident pass unrebuked. Even lovers, though\nthey have not the status of the husband, must be allowed a little\nlatitude now and again.\n\nWe talked over all the possibilities that we could either of us think of\nwith regard to a secret passage between the castle and the monument. It\nwas apparent that in old time such a hidden way might have been of the\nutmost importance; and it was more than possible that such a passage\nmight exist. Already we had reason to believe that there was a way\nbetween the ruined chapel and the top of the reservoir hill, and we knew\nthat there must be existing some secret hiding place gained from the\ninterior of the chapel. What we had still to discover, and this was the\nmost important of all, was whether there was a method of communication\nbetween the castle and the chapel. After tea we started out together;\nand as we had arranged between us before starting, managed in our\nstrolling to go quite round the castle and through many of the grassy\nalleys between the woods. Then, lest there should be any listener, I\nsaid:\n\n\"Let us go into the old chapel. I haven't had a good look at it since I\nhave been coming here!\" So we went into the chapel and began to lay our\ntraps. Of course we could not guard against any one spying upon us.\nThere might be eyes of enemies bent on us through some secret chink or\ncranny or organised spy-hole. This we could not help, and had to take\nour chances of it; but if anyone were within ear-shot and unable to\nsee us, we guarded our movements by our misleading remarks concerning\nhistory and art. Deftly Marjory stretched sections of her gossamer\nthread from place to place, so that if any one went in the chapel their\ncourse must be marked by the broken threads. We finished near the door,\nand our artless, innocent, arch\u00c3\u00a6ological conversation stopped there,\ntoo. We strolled back to the castle, feeling sure that if there were any\nsecret hiding place within the ruin we should have located the entrance\nto it in the morning.\n\nThat afternoon I went to the house at Whinnyfold. Most of the things\nwhich I had ordered had arrived, and when I had had the various boxes\nand bundles moved inside I felt able to start on my work.\n\nFirst I rigged up a proper windlass over the hole into the cave; and\nfixed it so that any one could manipulate it easily and safely from\nabove. It could be also worked from below by aid of an endless chain\nround the axle. I hammered the edges of the hole somewhat smoother,\nso that no chance friction might cut the rope; and I fixed candles\nand lanterns in various places, so that all the light which might be\nnecessary could be had easily. Then I furnished a room with rugs and\npillows, and with clothes for Marjory for changing. She would be sure to\nrequire such, when our search after the treasure should come off. I had\nready some tins of provisions, and I had arranged at the hotel that as\nI might sometimes stay and work in my own home--I was supposed to be an\nauthor--some fresh provisions were to be sent over each morning, and\nleft ready for me with Mrs. Hay at Whinnyfold. By the time my work was\nthrough, it was late in the evening, and I went to the hotel to sleep.\nI had arranged with Marjory to be with her early in the morning. It\nwas hardly daylight when I woke, but I got up at once and took my way\ntowards Crom, for the experience of the day before had shown me that\nwhoever used the path near the monument used it in the grey of the dawn.\nAs usual I hid my bicycle and took my way cautiously to the monument. By\nthis time the sun was up and the day was bright; the dew lay heavy, and\nwhen I came on any of my threads I could easily distinguish them by the\nshimmering beads which made each thread look like a miniature rope of\ndiamonds.\n\nAgain the strings across the path were broken. My heart beat heavily\nas I began to follow back towards the monument the track of the broken\nthread. It led right up to it, on the side away from the castle, and\nthen stopped. The other threads all round the monument were intact.\nHaving learned so much, my first act was to prevent discovery of my\nown plan. Accordingly I carefully removed all the threads, broken and\nunbroken. Then I began to make minute investigation of the monument\nitself. As it was evident that whoever had broken the threads had come\nstraight from it, there was a presumption that there was an opening\nsomewhere. The rock below was unbroken and the stonework was seemingly\nfixed on the rock itself. By a process of exclusions I came to the\nbelief that possibly the monument itself might be moveable.\n\nAccordingly I began to experiment. I pressed against it, this way and\nthat. I tried to move it by exercising pressure top and bottom in turn;\nbut always without avail. Then I began to try to move it sideways as\nthough it might be on a pivot. At first there was no yielding, no answer\nof any kind to my effort; but suddenly I thought I perceived a slight\nmovement. I tried again and again, using my strength in the same way;\nbut with no result. Then I tried turning it in the suspected direction,\nholding both my hands low down on the corners of the boulder; then going\ngradually up higher I pursued the same effort; again no response. Still\nI felt I was on the track and began to make efforts in eccentric ways.\nAll at once, whilst I was pressing with my left hand low down whilst I\npulled with my right high up on the other edge, the whole great stone\nbegan to move in a slow easy way, as though in perfect poise. I\ncontinued the movement and the stone turned lazily over on one side,\nrevealing at my very feet a dark opening of oval form some three feet\nacross its widest part. Somehow I was not altogether surprised; my head\nkept cool in what was to me a wonderful way. With an impulse which was\nbased on safety, lest the opening of the hole should make discovery of\nmy presence, I reversed the action; and the stone rolled slowly over to\nits old position. Several times I moved it from its place and then back\nagain, so that I might become accustomed to its use.\n\nFor a while I hesitated as to whether I should explore the opening\nimmediately; but soon came to the conclusion that I had better begin\nat once. So I went back to my bicycle and took the lamp with me. I had\nmatches in my case, and as I had the revolver which I always carried\nnow, I felt equal to any emergency. I think I was finally influenced in\nmy decision to attempt the passage at once by the remembrance of\nMarjory's remark that the kidnappers would make no effort until their\nplans were quite complete. They, more than I, might fear discovery; and\non this hope I was strong as I lowered myself down through the narrow\nopening. I was glad to see that there was no difficulty in moving the\nstone from the inside; there were two iron handles let into the stone\nfor the purpose.\n\nI cannot say I was at ease in my mind, I was, however, determined to go\non; and with a prayer to God for protection, and a loving thought of\nMarjory, I went on my way.\n\nThe passage was doubtless of natural origin, for it was evident that\nthe seams in the rock were much like those on the coast where the strata\nof different geological formations joined. Art had, however improved the\nplace wonderfully. Where the top had come too low it had been quarried\naway; the remnants still lay adjacent where the cave broadened out. The\nfloor where the slope was steep was cut into rough steps. Altogether,\nthere were signs of much labour in the making of the passage. As I went\ndown, I kept an eye on the compass whenever I came to a turn, so that I\nmight have a rough idea of the direction in which I was going. In the\nmain the road, with counterbalancing curves and angles, led straight\ndown.\n\nWhen I had got to what I considered must be half way, allowing for the\nastounding magnitude which seems to be the characterisation of even a\nshort way under ground; the passage forked, and at a steep angle another\npassage, lower and less altered than that along which I had come, turned\naway to the left. Going a few feet up it I could hear the sound of\nrunning water.\n\nThis was evidently the passage to the reservoir.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXI\n\nMARJORY'S ADVENTURE\n\n\nAs I felt that time, in which I had the passage all to myself, was\nprecious, I turned back to the main way down. The path was very steep\nand low and the rock underfoot was cut in rude steps; as I held the\nlantern before me I had to droop it so that I could smell the hot metal\nwhere the flame touched the back. It was indeed a steep and difficult\nway, made for others than men of my own stature. As I went, I felt my\nfirst fears passing away. At first I had dreaded a lack of air, and all\nsorts of horrors which come to those who essay unknown passages. There\ncame back to my recollection passages in Belzoni's explorations in the\nPyramids when individuals had got lost, and when whole parties were\nstopped by the first to advance jamming in a narrow passage as he\ncrawled along on his belly. Here, though the roof came down in places\ndangerously low, there was still ample room, and the air came up sweet\nand cool. To any one unused to deep burrows, whether the same be natural\nor artificial, there is a dread of being underground. One is cut off\nfrom light and air; and burial alive in all its potential horrors is\nalways at hand. However, the unexpected clearness and easiness of the\nway reassured me; and I descended the steep passage with a good heart.\nAll distance underground seems extravagantly long to those unaccustomed\nto it; and to me the mere depth I had descended seemed almost impossible\nwhen the way before me became somewhat level again. At the same time\nthe roof rose so that I could stand upright. I guessed that I must\nbe now somewhere at the foot of the hillock and not far from the old\nchapel; so I went forward carefully, keeping my hand ready to cover up\nthe front of the lamp. As the ground was fairly level, I could in a\nway pace it; and as I knew that there was only about two hundred feet\ndistance from the foot of the hill to the chapel, I was not surprised\nwhen after some eighty paces I found the passage end in a sort of rude\nchamber cut in the rock. At right angles to the place of my entry there\nwas a regular stairway, partly cut in rock and partly built, leading\nupward. Before I ascended I looked around carefully and could see that\nsections of the walls of the chamber were built of great blocks of\nstone. Leaving further investigation for the future I went upward with a\nbeating heart.\n\nThe stair was rudely circular, and I had counted thirty steps when I saw\nthe way blocked by a great stone. For a few seconds I was in fear lest I\nshould find this impossible; then I looked carefully for any means of\nmoving the obstacle. I thought it more than likely that something of the\nsame process would be adopted for both ends of the passage.\n\nLuck was certainly on my side to-day! Here were two iron handles, much\nthe same as those with which I had been enabled to move the monument\nfrom within. I grasped them firmly, and began to experiment as to which\nway the stone moved. It trembled under my first effort; so exerting a\nvery little of my strength in the same direction the great stone began\nto move. I saw a widening line of open space through which a dim light\nshone in upon me. Holding the stone in poise with one hand, I covered\nthe front of the lamp with my cap, and then resumed the opening process.\nSlowly, slowly, the stone rolled back till a clear way lay abreast of me\nthrough which, doubled up, I could pass. From where I stood I could see\npart of the wall of a building, a wall with long low windows in massive\nstone; and I knew that at last I had reached the old chapel. A joyous\nfeeling rushed over me; after the unknown perils of the cavern passage\nat last I had reached safety. I bent low and began to step out through\nthe narrow opening. There was fully four feet in the circumference of\nthe stone so that two such steps as were possible to me were necessary\nto take me out. I had taken one and my foot was lifted for the second\nwhen a clear firm voice said in a whisper:\n\n\"Hands up! If you move you are a dead man!\" I stopped of course, and\nraising my face, for my head was bent low in the necessary effort of\nstooping, I found myself opposite the muzzle of a revolver. For an\ninstant I looked at it; it was firm as the rock around me, and I felt\nthat I must obey. Then I looked beyond it, to the hand which held it,\nand the eyes which directed. These too were inflexible; but a great joy\ncame over me when I recognised that the hand and eyes were those of\nMarjory. I would have sprung forward to her, but for that ominous ring\nof steel in front of me. I waited a few seconds, for it seemed strange\nthat she did not lower the revolver on seeing who it was. As, however,\nthe pistol still covered me unpleasantly, I said:\n\n\"Marjory!\" In an instant her hand dropped to her side. I could not but\nnotice with an admiration for her self-control and the strength of her\nresolution, that she still held the revolver in her grasp. With a glad\ncry she leaped towards me with a quick impulsive movement which made my\nheart bound, for it was all love and spontaneity. She put her left hand\non my shoulder; and as she looked into my eyes I could feel the glad\ntremor that swept through her.\n\nFor several seconds she stood, and then with a sigh said in a voice of\nself-reproach:\n\n\"And _I_ did not know _you_!\" The way she spoke the words \"I\" \"you\" was\nluminous! Had I not already known her heart, she would in that moment\nhave stood self-revealed.\n\nWe were manifestly two thoroughly practical people, for even in the\nrapture of our meeting--to me it was no less than rapture to come\nfrom so grim an aperture in the secret cavern passage--we had our wits\nabout us. I think she was really the first to come to a sense of our\nsurroundings; for just as I was opening my mouth to speak she held up a\nwarning finger.\n\n\"Hush! Some one may come; though I think there is no one near. Wait\ndear, whilst I look!\" she seemed to flit noiselessly out of the doorway\nand I saw her vanish amongst the trees. In a few minutes she returned\ncarrying carefully a wicker basket. As she opened it she said:\n\n\"Some one might suspect something if they saw you in that state.\"\nShe took from the basket a little bowl of water, soap, towel and a\nclothes-brush. Whilst I washed my face and hands she was brushing me\ndown. A very short time completed a rough toilet. Then she poured\nthe water carefully into a crack in the wall, and putting the things\ntogether with my lamp, back in the basket, she said:\n\n\"Come now! Let us get to the Castle before any one finds us. They will\nthink that I have met you in the wood.\" We went as unobtrusively as we\ncould to the Castle; and entered, I think, unobserved. I had a thorough\nclean up before I let any one see me; our secret was too precious to\nrisk discovery by suspicion. When I had seen Mrs. Jack, Marjory took me\nto her boudoir in the top of the castle, and there, whilst she sat by\nme holding my hands, I told her every detail of my adventure. I could\nfeel how my story moved her; when there was any passage of especial\ninterest the pressure of her clasp grew tense. She, who had seemingly no\nfear for herself, was all in fear for me!\n\nThen we talked matters over. We had now a good clue to the comings\nand goings of the kidnappers; and we felt that by a little thoughtful\norganisation we might find their hours, and be able to trace them one\nby one. By lunch time we had decided on our plan of action. We took our\nidea from one of the old \"Tales of the Genii\" where the conquered king\nwas brought by his faithful vizier into a cavern and asked to cut a rope\nwhich was stretched before him, and which he soon discovered released\nthe great rock which roofed the pavilion specially built by the vizier\nto be seen and occupied by the conqueror. We would fix a fine thread to\nthe top of the monument and bring it secretly to the castle, where its\nbreaking would apprise Marjory of the opening of the passage; thus she\nwould discover the hour of the coming of the kidnappers to the chapel.\nWe arranged another ingenious device, whereby a second thread, fastened\nto the stone in the old chapel, would be broken by the opening of the\nstone, and would cause a book to fall on Marjory's bed and wake her if\nshe were asleep. The better part of the afternoon was taken up by us\ncarrying out these ideas, for we went slowly and cautiously to work.\nThen I went home.\n\nI was early at the monument in the morning, and getting behind the stone\nsignalled to the Castle roof in case Marjory should happen to expect me\nand be there. But there was no answer. So I sat down to wait till it\nwould be decent time to go to the Castle for an early breakfast.\n\nAs I sat waiting I thought I heard a sound, either close to me and\nmuffled, or else distant; I could hardly tell which. Matters might be\nlively if I were discovered; so I got my revolver ready. With my heart\nbeating so heavily that I mistook it at moments for the foreign sound, I\nlistened and listened, all ears.\n\nIt was as I had suspected; the sound came from the tunnel beneath me. I\nhardly knew whether to stay or go. If I waited I could see who came from\nthe opening; but on the other hand I should at once be known to have\ndiscovered the secret. Still as the stone might roll back at any moment,\nit was necessary that I should make up my mind; I should either go or\nstay. I decided that I would stay and make discovery at once. In any\ncase should I succeed in capturing a blackmailer, or even in discovering\nor partially discovering his identity, I should be aiding in Marjory's\nsafety. So I got my revolver ready; and standing back so that I could\nnot be seen at once by any one emerging, waited.\n\nNo one came; but I could still hear a slight sound. Filled with a\ngrowing unrest, I determined to take the initiative, and began to move\nclose to the stone. As I looked, it began to quiver, and then to move\nslowly. As it rolled softly back I kept behind it so that I might not be\nseen; and waited with revolver ready and what patience I could.\n\nThere was dead silence; and then a hand holding a revolver rested a\nmoment on the edge of the opening.\n\nI knew the hand, and I knew the revolver, and I knew the quickness of\nboth. I did not say a word or make a sound, till Marjory with an alert\nmovement seemed to sweep up out of the opening and whirled round with\nready pistol, as though suspecting an enemy on every side.\n\nMarjory, all covered with dust, her cheeks as white as snow, so that the\nsmears of dust lay on them like soot; and eyes with pupils distended\nas in coming from the dark. For a few seconds she seemed hardly to\nrecognise me; but when she did she sprang gladly into my arms.\n\n\"Oh! Archie, I am glad to see you. It was so terrible and lonely in the\ndark. I began to fear I might never find my way out!\" In the dark! I\nbegan to fear, and asked her:\n\n\"But, dear one, how did you come; and why? Hadn't you got a light with\nyou? Surely you didn't come unprepared, if you did venture into the\ncave!\" Then in a rush she told me the whole story. How before dawn she\nhad been waked by the dropping of the book and had hurried to the castle\nroof to watch the stone. With her field glass she had presently seen it\nmove. She was then satisfied that the watchers had gone home; and had\ndetermined on a little adventure on her own account.\n\n\"I put on a grey tweed dress, and taking my revolver and bicycle lamp,\nstole out of the castle and reached the old chapel. Having lit my lamp,\nI rolled back the stone and set out to explore the tunnel. I followed\nfrom your description, the passage to its bifurcating, and determined to\nexplore the other arm to the reservoir. I easily found it, a deep, dark\ntank cut in the rock and seemingly fed by springs which bubbled up from\npatches of fine sand, the accumulation of years of wasting rock. Whilst\nI was trying to look into the depth of the reservoir, holding my bicycle\nlamp so as to throw its light downwards, I saw something white at the\nbottom. Just then the lamp from its inverted position began to smoke,\nbut as I looked in that last moment through the crystal pure water I\nrecognised that the white object was a skull. In the sudden shock of the\ndiscovery, the lamp dropped from my hand and disappeared hissing and\nbubbling in the last flicker of light.\" As she told me this, I took her\nhand for I feared that the memory of such an appalling moment must have\nunnerved her; but to my surprise her nerves were as firm as my own. She\nlet her hand remain in mine; but she had evidently understood my thought\nfor she said:\n\n\"Oh! it's all right now, Archie. For a moment or two I do believe I was\nfrightened. You can have the laugh on me there if you like! But then\ncommon sense came to my aid. I was in a tight place, and it would need\nall I knew to get out. I thought the matter over as coolly as I could;\nand do you know that coolness seemed to grow with the effort! I was in\nthe dark, in a cave, deep underground, the entrance to which was secret;\nI had no means of getting a light even for an instant, for though I had\ntaken plenty of wax matches they were all in my lamp. The only thing I\ncould do was to try to grope my way out. I had noted the passage as\nI came along, but I found so soon as I had felt my way out of the\nreservoir chamber, how little use an abstract recollection is when every\nsecond there is a new detail. I found, too, the astonishing difference\nbetween sight and touch; what I had remembered had been with my eyes and\nnot with my fingers. I had to guard all round me, my head, my feet, my\nsides. I am amazed, now when I think of it, how many different kinds of\nmistakes and calculations I made in a few yards. It seemed a terribly\nlong time till I came to the place where the passage forks. There I\nweighed up the matter of whether it would be better to go back by the\nway I had come to the old chapel, or to go up the other passage to the\nmonument of which you told me. Somehow the latter seemed to me the more\nfeasible. I think it must have been that I trusted you more than myself.\nYou had not shrunk from going into that passage; and I would not shrink\nfrom going out.\"\n\nI squeezed her hands hard, I had got both by this time. She blushed a\nlittle and looked at me fondly and went on:\n\n\"There was something cheering in the mere fact of going up instead of\ndown. It was like coming towards the air and light again; and the time\ndid not seem so long till I came to the end of the passage, for so far\nas I could feel there was nothing but solid rock all round me. For a\nlittle bit my heart sank again; but I soon bucked up. I knew that this\nmust be the way out; and I felt around for the iron handles of which you\nhad told me. And then, Thank God for His goodness! when the stone began\nto turn I saw the light, and breathed fresh air again. They seemed to\ngive me back all my courage and caution. Up to this I had not troubled\nabout kidnappers; there was quite enough to think of in getting along\nthe passage. But now I was my own woman again, and I determined to take\nno chances. When I saw it was your gun that was aimed at me I was\nglad!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXII\n\nTHE LOST SCRIPT\n\n\nAfter a little consideration of ways and means, we decided that the best\nthing we could do was to pass through the passage to the old chapel.\nIt was still very early, so early that in all probability none of the\nhousehold were yet awake; if Marjory could regain her room before\nbeing seen, it would avoid curiosity. She was certainly in a shocking\ncondition of dust and dishevelment. Her groping in the dark through that\nlong rugged passage had not been accomplished without many hardships.\nHer dress was torn in several places, and her hat was simply knocked to\npieces; even her hair was tumbled about, and had been put up again and\nagain with dusty fingers. She saw me smiling; I think it pained her a\nlittle for she suddenly said:\n\n\"Come along quick; it's simply awful standing here in the light of day\nin this filthy state. It won't feel half so bad in the dark passage!\"\nWithout more ado I lit my lamp, and having, of course, closed the\nentrance behind us, we went back into the cavern.\n\nThe tramp back through the tunnel did not seem nearly so long or so\ndifficult as at first. It may have been that comparative familiarity\nmade it easier; it certainly eased its terrors. Or it is possible that\nour companionship, each to the other, made the bearing of fears and\ndifficulties lighter.\n\nAnyhow, it was something of a surprise to both of us to find ourselves\nso quickly in the rude chamber whence the steps led up to the old\nchapel. Before we left this, we made a rough examination of it, turning\nthe lantern over walls and floor and ceiling; for I had an idea that the\npassage from the castle, which I was satisfied must exist, made its exit\nhere. We could not, however, see any external sign of an opening; the\nwalls were built up of massive unmortared stones, and were seemingly as\nsolid as the rock itself.\n\nWhen we got into the chapel we found the utility of Marjory's foresight.\nIn a corner was her little basket with soap and towel, water and clothes\nbrush; and together we restored her to some semblance of decency. Then\nshe went back to the castle and got in unobserved, as I, watching from\nthe shelter of the trees, could see. I took my way back through the\npassage; and so to the wood where my bicycle was hidden. I washed my\nhands in the stream and lay down in the shelter of a thick grove of\nhazel, where I slept till breakfast time. When I rode up to the castle,\nI found Marjory with her kodak on the sweep outside, taking views of its\nvarious points.\n\nThe morning was intensely hot; and here, in the shelter of the little\nvalley and the enclosing wood, the air was sultry, and the sun beat down\npitilessly. We had a table set out under the shelter of the trees and\nbreakfasted _al fresco_.\n\nWhen we were alone in her boudoir I settled with Marjory that we would\non that evening attempt to find the treasure, as the tide would be out\nat midnight. So we went down to the library and got out Don de Escoban's\nnarrative and began to read it afresh, noting as we went every word and\nsign of the secret writing, in the hope that we might in thus doing\nstumble on some new secret or hidden meaning.\n\nWhilst we were thus engaged a servant came looking for Mrs. Jack, for\nwhom a stranger had brought a letter. Marjory told where she might be\nfound, and for some time we went on with our work.\n\nSuddenly the door opened, and Mrs. Jack entered, speaking over her\nshoulder as she came to a high-bred looking, dark man who followed her.\nAs she saw us she stopped and said to Marjory:\n\n\"Oh! my dear, I didn't know you were here. I thought you were in the\nladies' room.\" This was what they usually called the big room at the top\nof the castle. We both rose, seeing a stranger. For my own part there\nwas something in his face which set me thinking; as to Marjory I could\nnot help noticing that she drew herself up to her full height, and held\nherself at tension in that haughty way which now and again marked her\nhigh spirit and breeding. There seemed so little cause for this attitude\nthat my own thinking of the new-comer was lost in the contemplation\nof hers. Mrs. Jack noticed that there was some awkwardness, and spoke\nhurriedly:\n\n\"This is the gentleman, my dear, that the agent wrote about; and as\nhe wanted to look over the house I brought him myself.\" The stranger\nprobably taking his cue from her apologetic tone spoke:\n\n\"I trust I have not disturbed the Senora; if I have, pardon! I have but\ncome to renew my memory of a place, dear to me in my youth, and which\nthrough the passing of time and of some who were, is now my own\nheritage.\" Marjory smiled, and swept him a curtsey as she said, but\nstill in her distant arm's-length manner:\n\n\"Then you are the owner of the castle, sir. I hope that we do not\ndisturb you. Should you wish to be anywhere alone we shall gladly\nwithdraw and wait your pleasure.\" He raised a hand of eloquent protest,\na well-kept, gentleman's hand, as he said in tones sweet and deferent:\n\n\"Oh! I pray you, do not stir. May I say that when my house is graced\nwith the presence of so much loveliness I am all too full of gratitude\nto wish for any change. I shall but look around me, for I have a certain\nduty to do. Alas! this my heritage comes not only as a joy, but with\ngrave duties which I must fulfill. Well I know this room. Many a time as\na boy I have sat here with my kinsman, then so old and distant from me\nin my race; and yet I am his next successor. Here has he told me of old\ntimes, and of my race of which we who have the name are so proud; and of\nthe solemn duty which might some day come to me. Could I but tell....\"\nHere he stopped suddenly.\n\nHis eyes had been wandering all over the room, up and down the\nbookshelves, and at the few pictures which the walls contained. When\nthey rested on the table, a strange look came into them. Here lay\nthe type-script which we had been reading, and the secret writing of\nthe dotted printing. It was on the latter that his eyes were fixed\nabsorbingly.\n\n\"Where did you get that?\" he said suddenly, pointing to it. The question\nin its bald simplicity was in word rude, but his manner of asking it was\nso sweet and deferential that to me it robbed it of all offence. I was\njust about to answer when my eye caught that of Marjory, and I paused.\nThere was such meaning in her eyes that my own began roving to find the\ncause of it. As I looked she put her hands on the table before her, and\nher fingers seemed to drum nervously. To me, however, it was no nervous\ntrifling; she was speaking to me in our own cipher.\n\n\"Be careful!\" she spelled out \"there is some mystery! Let me speak.\"\nThen turning to the stranger she said:\n\n\"It is curious is it not?\"\n\n\"Ah, Senora, though curious it be in itself, it is nothing to the\nstrangeness of its being here. If you only knew how it had been searched\nfor; how the whole castle had been ransacked from roof to dungeon to\nfind it, and always without avail. Did you but understand the import of\nthat paper to me and mine--if indeed the surmises of many generations\nof anxious men availed aught--you would pardon my curiosity. In my own\nyouth I assisted in a search of the whole place; no corner was left\nuntouched, and even the secret places were opened afresh.\" As he went\non, Marjory's eyes were resting on his face unflinchingly, but her\nfingers were spelling out comments to me.\n\n\"There are secret places, then; and he knows them. Wait\" the stranger\nwent on:\n\n\"See, I shall convince you that I speak from no idle curiosity, but from\na deep conviction of a duty that was mine and my ancestors' for ages.\"\nThere was a sternness mingled with his grave sweetness now; it was\nevident that he was somewhat chagrined or put out by our silence.\nLeaving the table he went over to one of the bookshelves, and after\nrunning his eye over it for a moment, put his hand up and from a shelf\nabove his head took down a thick leather-covered volume. This he laid\non the table before us. It was a beautiful, old black letter law book,\nwith marginal notes in black letter and headings in roman type. The\npagination was, I could see as he turned it over, by folios. He turned\nto the title-page, which was an important piece of printing in many\ntypes, explanatory of the matter of the book. He began to read the\nparagraphs, placed in the triangular in form in vogue at that day;\nfollowing the text with his forefinger he read:\n\n\"A collection in English of the Statutes now in force, continued from\nthe beginning of Magna Charta made in the 9. yeere of the reigne of King\nH. 3. until the ende of the Session of Parliament holden in the 28 yeere\nof the reigne of our gracious Queene Elizabeth under Titles placed by\norder of Alphabet. Wherein is performed (touching the Statutes wherewith\nJustices of the Peace have to deale) so much as was promised in the\nBooke of their office lately published. For which purpose\"--&c.\n&c.,--Then turning over the page he pointed to a piece of faded writing\non the back of it which had been left blank of printing. We bent down\nand read in the ink, faded to pale brown by time:\n\n\"My sonnes herein you will find the law which binds the stranger in this\nland, wherein a stranger is a Vagabond. F. de E.\n\n  XXIII. X. MDLXLIX.\"\n\nThen he turned rapidly over the leaves, till towards the end there was a\ngap. On the right hand page, where the folio number was all along placed\nwas the number 528.\n\n\"See,\" he said, turning back and pointing to the bottom of the title\npage \"Anno 1588. Three hundred years, since first my people used it.\"\n\nTurning back he looked at the folio before the gap; it was 510. \"See\"\nhe said, placing his hand on the pinmarked pages. \"Folio 511 and the\nheading of 'Vagabonds, Beggars, et cetera.'\" He folded his arms in a\ndignified way and stood silent.\n\nAll along I had been following my own train of thought, even whilst\nI had been taking in the stranger's argument, and at the same time\nnoting Marjory's warning. If this man who owned the Castle knew of the\nexistence of the secret writing; whose ancestors had owned the book in\nwhich was the clue signed F. de E., surely then this could be none other\nthan the descendant of the Don Bernardino who had hidden the treasure.\nThis was his castle; no wonder that he knew its secret ways.\n\nMatters were getting complicated. If this man were now the hereditary\nguardian of the hidden treasure--and from his likeness to the ghostly\nSpaniard whom I had seen in the procession at Whinnyfold I saw no reason\nto doubt it--he might be an enemy with whom we should have to cope. I\nwas all in a whirl, and for a few seconds I think quite lost my head.\nThen rushed over me the conviction that the mere lapse of time passed\nin these few minutes of agonised silence was betraying our secret. This\nbrought me up with a round turn, and I looked about me. The strange man\nwas standing still as marble; his face was set, and there was no sign of\nlife in him except his eyes which blazed as they wandered around, taking\neverything in. Mrs. Jack saw that there was something going on which she\ndid not understand, and tried to efface herself. Marjory was standing by\nthe table, still, erect and white. Her fingers began to drum softly as\nshe caught my eye, and spelled out:\n\n\"Give him the paper, from Mrs. Jack. Lately found in old oak chest. Say\nnothing of interpretation.\" This seemed such a doubtful move that with\nmy eyes I queried it. She nodded in reply. So I gathered myself together\nand said:\n\n\"I'm afraid, sir, that there is some mystery here which I cannot\nundertake to understand. I think I may say, however, for my friend Mrs.\nJack, that there will be no trouble in your having full possession of\nyour book. I am told that these pages were lately found in an old oak\nchest. It is remarkable that they should have been missing so long. We\nwere attracted by the funny marks. We thought that there might be some\nsort of cryptogram; and I suppose I may take it, from the fact of your\nlooking for them so long, that this is so?\"\n\nHe grew suspicious in a moment, and stiffened all over. Marjory saw, and\nappreciated the reason. She smiled at me with her eyes as she drummed on\nthe table:\n\n\"The herring is across his path!\" As the awkward pause was this time\nwith the stranger, we waited with comparative ease. I saw with a feeling\nof wonder that there was, through all her haughtiness, a spice of malice\nin Marjory's enjoyment of his discomfiture. I looked at Mrs. Jack and\nsaid: \"May I give these papers to Mr. ----\" She answered promptly:\n\n\"Why cert'nly! If Mr. Barnard wants them.\" Marjory turned round suddenly\nand in a surprised voice said:\n\n\"Mr. Barnard?\"\n\n\"That is the name given in the letter which he brought, my dear!\" The\nstranger at once spoke out:\n\n\"I am Mr. Barnard here; but in my own country I am of an older name.\nI thank you, sir, and Madam\" turning to Mrs. Jack \"for your courteous\noffer. But it will be time enough for me to consider the lost pages when\nthrough the unhappiness of your departure from my house, I am enabled to\ncome hither to live. In the meantime, all I shall ask is that the pages\nbe replaced in this book and that it be put in its place on the shelf\nwhere none shall disturb it.\" As he spoke in his sweet, deferential way\nthere was something in his look or manner which did not accord with his\nwords; a quick eager shifting of his eyes, and a breathing hard which\nwere at variance with his words of patience. I did not pretend, however,\nto notice it; I had my own game to play. So without a word I placed the\npages carefully in the book and put the latter back on the shelf from\nwhich he had taken it. There was an odd look in Marjory's face which I\ndid not quite understand; and as she gave me no clue to her thoughts by\nour sign language, I waited. Looking at the stranger haughtily, and with\na distinctly militant expression she said:\n\n\"The agent told us that the Barnard family owned this castle!\" He bowed\ngravely, but a hot, angry flush spread over his face as he replied:\n\n\"He spoke what truth he knew.\" Marjory's reply came quickly:\n\n\"But you say you are one of the family, and the very memorandum you\npointed out was signed F. de E.\" Again the hot flush swept his face; but\npassed in an instant, leaving him as pale as the dead. After a pause of\na few moments he spoke in a tone of icy courtesy:\n\n\"I have already said, Senora, that in this country our name--my name, is\nBarnard. A name taken centuries ago when the freedom of the great land\nof England was not as now; when tolerance for the stranger was not. In\nmy own land, the land of my birth, the cradle of my race, I am called\nDon Bernardino Yglesias Palealogue y Santordo y Castelnuova de Escoban,\nCount of Minurca and Marquis of Salvaterra!\" As he rehearsed his titles\nhe drew himself up to his full height; and pride of race seemed actually\nto shine or emanate from him. Marjory, too, on her side of the table\ndrew herself up proudly as she said in a voice in which scorn struggled\nfor mastery with dignity:\n\n\"Then you are a Spaniard!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIII\n\nDON BERNARDINO\n\n\nThe stranger held himself with, if possible, greater hauteur as he\nanswered:\n\n\"I have that great honour.\"\n\n\"And I, sir,\" said Marjory, with a pride rivalling his own, \"am an\nAmerican!\" Issue was joined.\n\nFor a period which from its strain seemed very long, though it was\nprobably but a few seconds, they stood facing each other; types of the\ntwo races whose deadly contest was then the interest of the world. The\ntime was at any rate sufficiently long for me to consider the situation,\nand to admire the types. It would have been hard to get a better\nrepresentative of either, of the Latin as well as of the Anglo-Saxon.\nDon Bernardino, with his high aquiline nose and black eyes of eagle\nkeenness, his proud bearing and the very swarthiness which told of\nMoorish descent, was, despite his modern clothes, just such a picture as\nVelasquez would have loved to paint, or as Fortuny might have made to\nlive again.\n\nAnd Marjory! She looked like the spirit of her free race, incarnate.\nThe boldness of her pose; her free bearing; her manifest courage and\nself belief; the absence of either prudery or self-consciousness; her\npicturesque, noble beauty, as with set white face and flashing eyes she\nfaced the enemy of her country, made a vision never to be forgotten.\nEven her racial enemy had unconsciously to fall into admiration; and\nthrough it the dominance of his masculine nature spoke. His words were\ngracious, and the easy gracefulness of their delivery was no less marked\nbecause the calm was forced:\n\n\"Our nations alas! Senora are at war; but surely not even the courtesies\nof the battlefield need be strained when individuals, even of the most\nloyal each to their own, meet on neutral soil!\" It was evident that even\nMarjory's quick wit did not grasp at a suitable reply. The forgiveness\nof enemies is not the strong point of any woman's nature, or of her\neducation. The only remark she made was to again repeat:\n\n\"I am an American!\" The Spaniard felt the strength of his position;\nagain his masculinity came out in his reply:\n\n\"And all good women, as well as all men, should be loyal to their Flag.\nBut oh Senora, before even your nationality comes your sex. The Spanish\nnation does not make war on women!\" He seemed really to believe what he\nsaid; for the proud light in his face could not have been to either a\ndastard or a liar. I confess it was with a shock that I heard Marjory's\nwords:\n\n\"In the _reconcentrados_ were as many women as men. More, for the men\nwere fighting elsewhere!\" The passionate, disdainful sneer on her lips\ngave emphasis to the insult; and blood followed the stab. A red tide\nrushed to the Spaniard's swarthy face, over forehead and ears and neck;\ntill, in a moment of quick passion of hate, he seemed as if bathed in\nred light.\n\nAnd then in truth I saw the very man of my vision at Whinnyfold.\n\nMarjory, womanlike, feeling her superiority over the man's anger, went\non mercilessly:\n\n\"Women and children herded together like beasts; beaten, starved,\ntortured, mocked at, shamed, murdered! Oh! it is a proud thought for a\nSpaniard, that when the men cannot be conquered, even in half a century\nof furious oppression, their baffled foes can wreak their vengeance on\nthe helpless women and children!\"\n\nThe Spaniard's red became white; a deathly pallor which looked grey\nin the darkened room. With his coldness came the force of coldness,\nself-command. I had a feeling that in those few moments of change had\ncome to him some grim purpose of revenge. It was borne in upon me by\nflashes of memory and instinct that the man was of the race and class\nfrom which came the rulers and oppressors of the land, the leaders of\nthe Inquisition. Eyes like his own, burning in faces of deathly white,\nlooked on deeds of torture, whose very memory after centuries can appal\nthe world. But with all his passion of hate and shame he never lost the\ninstinct of his dignity, or his grace of manner. One could not but feel\nthat even when he struck to kill he would strike with easeful grace.\nSomething of the feeling was in his speech, perhaps in the manner rather\nthan the words, when after a pause he said:\n\n\"For such foul acts I have nought but indignation and grief; though in\nthe history of a nation such things must be. It is the soldier's duty to\nobey; even though his heart revolt. I have memory of hearing that even\nyour own great nation has exercised not so much care as might be\"--how\nhe sneered with polished sarcasm as he turned the phrase--\"in the\ndealing with Indians. Nay more, even in your great war, when to kill was\nfratricidal, there were hardships to the conquered, even to the helpless\nwomen and children. Have I not heard that one of your most honoured\ngenerals, being asked what was to become of the women in a great march\nof devastation that he was about to make, replied, \"The women? I would\nleave them nothing but their eyes to weep with!\" But, indeed, I grieve\nthat in this our mutual war the Senora grieves. Is it that she has\nsuffered in herself, or through others dear to her?\" Marjory's eyes\nflashed; pulling herself to full height she said proudly:\n\n\"Sir, I am not one who whines for pain of my own. I and mine know how to\nbear our own troubles, as our ancestors did before us. We do not bend\nbefore Spain; no more to-day than when my great ancestors swept the\nSpaniard from the Western Main, till the seas were lit with blazing\nmasts and the shores were fringed with wreckage! We Americans are not\nthe stuff of which you make _reconcentrados_. We can die! As for me, the\nthree hundred years that have passed without war, are as a dream; I look\non Spain and the Spaniard with the eyes, and feel with the heart, of my\ngreat uncle Francis Drake.\"\n\nWhilst she was speaking Don Bernardino was cooling down. He was\nstill deadly pale, and his eyes had something of the hollow glare of\nphosphorus in the sockets of a skull. But he was master of himself; and\nit seemed to me that he was straining every nerve to recover, for some\npurpose of his own, his lost ground. It may have been that he was\nashamed of his burst of passion, with and before a woman; but anyhow he\nwas manifestly set on maintaining calm, or the appearance of it. With\nthe fullness of his grace and courtesy he said, turning to Mrs. Jack:\n\n\"I thank you for the permission, so graciously granted to me, to visit\nagain this my house. You will permit me, however, I hope without any\nintention of offence, to withdraw from where my presence has brought so\nmuch of disturbance; the which I deplore, and for which I crave pardon.\"\n\nTo me he bowed stiffly with a sort of lofty condescension; and finally,\nlooking towards Marjory, he said:\n\n\"The Senora will I trust believe that even a Spaniard may have pity\nto give pain; and that there are duties which gentlemen must observe\nbecause they are gentlemen, and because they reverence the trust that is\nreposed in them more than do common men. She can appreciate the call of\nduty I know; for she can be none other than the new patriot who restores\nin the west our glorious memories of the Maid of Saragossa. I pray that\nthe time may come when she shall understand these things and believe!\"\nThen, with a bow which seemed the embodiment of old-fashioned grace and\ncourtesy, he bent almost to the ground. Marjory instinctively bowed. Her\ntraining as to good manners, here stood her in good stead; not even\npatriotic enthusiasm can at times break the icy barrier of social\ndecorum.\n\nWhen the Spaniard left the room, which he did with long strides but\nbearing himself with inconceivable haughtiness, Mrs. Jack, with a glance\nat us, went with him. Instinctively I started to take her place; in the\nfirst instance to relieve her from an awkward duty, and beyond this with\na feeling that I was not quite satisfied with him. No one could be in\nantagonism with Marjory, and acquire or retain my good will. As I moved,\nMarjory held up her hand and whispered to me to stay. I did so, and\nwaited for her to explain. She listened intently to the retreating\nfootsteps; when we heard the echoing sound of the closing the heavy\nouter door, she breathed freely and said to me with relief in her voice:\n\n\"I know you two would have fought if you had got alone together just\nnow!\"\n\nI smiled, for I was just beginning to understand that that was just how\nI felt. Marjory remained standing at the table, and I could see that she\nwas buried in thought. Presently she said:\n\n\"I felt it was cruel to say such things to that gentleman. Oh! but he\nis a gentleman; the old idea seems embodied in him. Such pride, such\nhaughtiness; such disdain of the commoner kind; such adherence to ideas;\nsuch devotion to honour! Indeed, I felt it very cruel and ungenerous;\nbut I had nothing else to do. I had to make him angry; and I knew he\ncouldn't quarrel with me. Nothing else would have taken us all away from\nthe cipher.\" Her words gave me quite a shock. \"Do you mean to say\nMarjory,\" I asked, \"that you were acting a part all the time?\"\n\n\"I don't know\" she answered pensively, \"I meant every word I said, even\nwhen it hurt him most. I suppose that was the American in me. And yet\nall the time I had a purpose or a motive of my own which prompted me. I\nsuppose that was the woman in me.\"\n\n\"And what was the motive or purpose?\" I asked again, for I wondered.\n\n\"I don't know!\" she said naively. I felt that she was concealing\nsomething from me; but that it was a something so tender or so deep in\nher heart that its very concealment was a shy compliment. So I smiled\nhappily as I said:\n\n\"And that is the girl in you. The girl that is American, and European,\nand Asiatic, and African, and Polynesian. The girl straight out of the\nGarden of Eden, with the fragrance of God's own breath in her mouth!\"\n\n\"Darling!\" she said, looking at me lovingly. That was all.\n\nDuring the day, we discussed the visitor of the morning. Mrs. Jack said\nvery little, but now and again implored Marjory to be cautious; when she\nwas asked her reason for the warning her only reply was:\n\n\"I don't like a man who can look like that. I don't know which is worst,\nwhen he is hot or cold!\" I gathered that Marjory in the main agreed\nwith her; but did not feel the same concern. Marjory would have been\nconcerned if the danger had been to anyone else; but she was not\nhabituated to be anxious about herself. Besides, she was young; and the\nantagonist was a man; and haughty and handsome, and interesting.\n\nIn the afternoon we completed our arrangements for the visit to the\ntreasure cave. We both felt the necessity for pressing on this matter,\nsince the existence of the secret writing was known to Don Bernardino.\nHe had not hesitated to speak openly, though he did not know of course\nthe extent of our own knowledge of the subject, of a grave duty which he\nhad undertaken from hereditary motives, or of the tragic consequences\nwhich might ensue. It was whilst we were speaking of the possibility of\nhis being able to decipher the cryptogram, that Marjory suddenly said:\n\n\"Did you understand exactly why I asked you to give him the paper at\nonce?\"\n\n\"Far be it from me\" I answered \"to profess to understand _exactly_ the\nmotives of any charming woman.\"\n\n\"Not even when she tells you herself?\"\n\n\"Ah! then the real mystery only begins!\" I said bowing. She smiled as\nshe replied:\n\n\"You and I are both fond of mysteries. So I had better tell you at once.\nThat man doesn't know the secret. I am sure of it. He knows there is a\nsecret; and he knows a part, but only a part. That eager look wouldn't\nhave been in his eye if he had known already. I daresay there is,\nsomewhere, some duplicate of what the original Don Bernardino put down\nin his story. And of course there must be some allusion to the treasure\nin the secret records at Simancas or the Quirinal or the Vatican.\nNeither the kings of Spain nor the Popes would let such a treasure pass\nout of mind. Indeed it is possible that there is some key or clue to it\nwhich he holds. Did you notice how he referred at once to the secret\nmeaning of the memorandum in the beginning of the law book? If we had\nnot given it up at once, he would have forced on the question and wished\nto take the paper away; and we could not have refused without letting\nhim know something by our very refusal. Do you understand any more of\nmy meaning now? And can you forgive me any more for my ill-mannered\noutbreak? That is what I am most sorry for, of all that has been in the\ninterview to-day. Is that also any more light to you on the mystery of a\nwoman's mind?\"\n\n\"It is, you dear! it is!\" I said as I took her for a moment in my arms.\nShe came easily and lovingly to me, and I could not but be assured that\nthe yielding even momentarily to tenderness helped to ease the strain\nwhich had been bearing upon her for so long. For my Marjory, though a\nstrong and brave one, was but a woman after all.\n\nAt six o'clock I took my way back to Whinnyfold; for I wanted to have\nall ready for our enterprise, and take full advantage of the ebb tide.\nWe arranged that on this occasion Marjory should come alone to join me\nat the house--our house.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIV\n\nTHE ACCOLADE\n\n\nWhen Marjory arrived, I had all ready for our exploration. There were\nseveral packages waiting for her, and when she emerged from the room\nwhere she had gone to change, their purpose was manifest. She appeared\nin a flannel tennis frock, short enough to show that she had put on her\nsand shoes on her bare feet. She saw that I noticed and said with a\nlittle blush:\n\n\"You see I am dressed for the part; you came back so wet the last time\nthat I thought I had better prepare for it too.\"\n\n\"Quite right, my dear,\" I said. \"That pretty head of yours is level.\" We\nwent to the cellar at once where I had lamps and candles prepared and\nready to light. I showed Marjory how to get up and down by herself,\nin case anything should happen to me. This made the gravity of our\nenterprise apparent. Her face grew a trifle anxious, though she did not\nchange colour; I could see that all her anxiety was for me and none\nfor herself. We took care to bring a plentiful supply of matches and\ncandles, as well as an extra lamp and an oil can, and some torches and\nred and white lights. All these were in a tin box to insure their being\nkept dry. I had a meal of bread and meat packed ready; also a bottle of\nwater and a flask of brandy, for the exploration might take a long time.\nThe tide was not quite out, and there was still in places a couple of\nfeet of water; but we decided to go on at once as it would give us more\ntime if we started on a falling tide.\n\nI took Marjory first up the passage inland, so that she might understand\nsomething of the lines of the cave system. There was, however, too much\ntide just then to show her where I surmised there might be some deep\nopening, perhaps permanently under water, into some of the other\ncaves. Then we retraced our steps and gained the pile of debris of the\nexplosion at the cave's mouth. I could not but notice how much Marjory\nwas impressed by the stillness of the place. Here, the tide, filtering\nin by innumerable crevices and rifts between the vast pile of stones,\nshowed no sign of the force of waves without. There was not time for the\nrise and fall of waves to be apparent; but the water maintained its\nlevel silently, except for that ceaseless gurgle which comes with the\npiling in of water anywhere, and is so constant that it does not strike\none as a sound. It was borne in upon us that the wildest storm without,\nwould make no impress upon us here in this cavern deep; and with it, as\nan inevitable corollary, came the depressing thought of our helplessness\nshould aught go wrong in the fastnesses of this natural prison.\n\nMarjory bounded over the slippery stones like a young deer, and when we\npassed through the natural archway into the cave beyond, her delight was\nmanifest. She was hurrying on so quickly that I found it necessary to\ntell her she must go slow so as to be able to take stock of all around\nher as she went. It was needful to look back as well as forward, so that\nshe might recognise the places when coming the other way. I reminded her\nof caution by holding up the great ball of stout cord which I carried,\nthe end of which was attached to the rope of the windlass in the\ncellar. \"Remember, dear,\" I said, \"that you have to be prepared for all\neventualities; if necessary to go back alone and in the dark.\" She\nshuddered a little and drew closer to me; I felt that the movement was\none of protection rather than of fear.\n\nWhen we went along the passage, where on the first occasion I had found\nthe water rise nearly to the roof, we had to wait; a little way ahead of\nus, where the cave dipped to its lowest, the water was still touching\nthe top. We possessed our souls with what patience we could, and in\nabout half an hour's time we were able to pass. We were quite wet,\nhowever, for only our faces and our lamps were above water; with the\nexception, of course, of the tin box with the candles and matches and\nour provisions, which I took care to keep dry.\n\nMarjory's delight at the sight of the huge red cave was unspeakable.\nWhen I lit one of the red lights the blinding glow filled the place,\nexposing every nook and corner, and throwing shadows of velvet\nblackness. The natural red of the granite suited the red light, the\neffect being intensely rich. Whilst the light lasted it was all like a\ndream of fairyland; and Marjory hung on to me in an ecstasy of delight.\nThen, when the light died down and the last sparks fell into the natural\ndarkness, it seemed as if we and all around us were steeped in gloom.\nThe little patches of faint light from our lamps seemed to our dazzled\neyes to openly emphasise the surrounding blackness.\n\nMarjory suggested that we should explore the great cavern before we did\nanything else. I acquiesced, for it was just as well that we should be\nthoroughly acquainted with the various ramifications of the cave. I was\nnot by any means sure as yet that we should be able to get to the cave\nof the treasure. Here, all around us, was red; we were entirely within\nthe sienite formation. When I had been first in the cave I had not seen\nit lit up. Only where the comparatively feeble light of my bicycle\nlantern had fallen had I seen anything at all. Of course it may have\nbeen that the red light which I had burned had misled me by overwhelming\neverything in its lurid glow. So this time I got a white light out of\nthe box and lit it. The effect was more ghastly and less pleasant. In\nthe revealing glare, the edges of everything stood out hard and cold,\nand so far repulsive that instinctively Marjory drew closer to me. While\nthe light remained, however, I was able to satisfy myself of one thing;\nall around was only the red granite. Colour and form and texture all\ntold the same thing; we had passed the stratification of gneiss and\nentered on that of the sienite. I began to wonder and to think, though I\ndid not at once mention the matter to Marjory. The one guiding light as\nto locality in the Don's narrative was the description of the cave \"the\nblack stone on one hand and the red on the other.\" Now at Broad Haven\nthe gneiss and the red sienite join, and the strata in places seem as if\nwelded together or fused by fire. Here and there can be found patches in\nthe cliff where it is hard to say where one class of rock ends and the\nother begins. In the centre bay, however, to the north of my house,\nthere is a sort of dip in the cliff covered deep with clay, and bright\nwith grass and wild flowers. Through this a tiny stream rushes in wet\nweather, or in dry trickles down the steep incline. This is the natural\nor main division between the geological formations; for on either side\nof it is a different kind of rock--it was here that I expected to find\nthat the treasure cave was situated. It had been of course impossible\nfor me, though I had had a compass with me, to fix exactly the windings\nof the cave. I knew, however, that the general trend was to the right;\nwe must, therefore, have passed behind the treasure cave and come into\nthe region of red granite. I began to have an idea, or rather the\nrudiment of one, that later on we should have to go back on our tracks.\nInasmuch as my own house stood on the gneiss formation, we should have\nto find whereabout in the cave windings the red and the black rocks\njoined. From this point we might be able to make new and successful\nprogress towards discovery of the treasure itself. In the meantime I was\ncontent to linger a few minutes in the great cavern. It was evident that\nMarjory was in love with it, and was at present in a whirl of delight.\nAnd, after all, she was my world, and her happiness my sunshine. I fully\nrealised in the delightful passages of our companionship the truth of\nthe lover's prayer in Herrick's pretty poem.\n\n   \"Give me but what this Ribbon bound,\n    Take all the rest the sun goes round.\"\n\nEvery day, every hour, seemed to me to be revealing new beauties of my\nwife's character and nature. She was herself becoming reconciled to our\nnew relationship; and in the confidence of her own happiness, and in her\ntrust of her husband, the playful and sweet sides of her nature were\ngaining a new development. I could not help feeling at times that all\nwas going on for the best; that the very restraint of the opening of\nour married life was formative of influence for good on us both. If\nall young husbands and wives could but understand the true use of the\nold-fashioned honeymoon, the minute knowledge of character coming in\nmoments of unconscious self-revelation, there might be more answers\nin the negative to the all important nineteenth century philosophical\nquery, \"Is marriage a failure?\" It was evident that Marjory was\nreluctant to leave the cave. She lingered and lingered; at last in\nobedience to a command of hers, conveyed--for she said nothing--in some\nof those subtle feminine ways, which, though I did not understand their\nmethods, I was beginning to learn to obey, I lit a torch. Holding it\naloft, and noticing with delight how the light danced in my wife's\nbeautiful eyes as she clapped her hands joyously with the overt pleasure\nof a child, I said:\n\n\"Her Majesty wishes to inspect her new kingdom. Her slave awaits her\npleasure!\"\n\n\"Lead on!\" she said. \"Her Majesty is pleased with the ready\nunderstanding of her Royal Consort, and with his swift obedience to her\nwishes; and oh! Archie isn't this simply too lovely for anything!\" The\nquick change into the vernacular made us both laugh; and taking hands\nlike two children we walked round the cavern. At the upper end of it,\nalmost at the furthest point from where we entered, we came across a\nplace where, under an overhanging red wall which spread out overhead\nlike a canopy, a great rock rose from the level floor. It was some\nnodule of especial hardness which in the general trituration had not\nbeen worn away by the wash of the water and the rolling of pebbles which\nat one time undoubtedly helped to smooth the floor. In the blinking\nlight of the torch, the strength of which was dimmed in the vastness of\nthe cavern, the isolated rock, standing as it did under the rocky canopy\nwhose glistening surface sent down a patchy reflex of the glare, seemed\nlike a throne. The idea occurred simultaneously to both of us; even as I\nspoke I could see that she was prepared to take her seat:\n\n\"Will not Her Majesty graciously take her seat upon the throne which the\ngreat Over-Lord, Nature, has himself prepared for her?\"\n\nShe took the stick which she carried to steady her in the wading, and\nholding it like a sceptre, said, and oh, but her sweet voice sounded\nlike far music stealing through the vastness of the cavern:\n\n\"Her Majesty, now that she has ascended her throne, and so, formally\ntaken possession of her Kingdom, hereby decrees that her first act of\npower shall be to confer the honour of Knighthood on her first and\ndearest subject. Kneel therefore at the feet of your Queen. Answer me by\nyour love and loyalty. Do you hereby promise and vow obedience to the\nwishes of your Queen? Shall you love her faithfully and truly and\npurely? Shall you hold her in your heart of hearts, yielding obedience\nto all true wishes of hers, and keeping the same steadfastly to the end?\nDo--you--love--me?\"\n\nHere she paused; the rising emotion was choking her words. The tears\nwelled into her eyes and her mouth quivered. I was all at once in a fire\nof devotion. I could then, and indeed when I think of it I can now,\nrealise how of old, in the days when loyalty was a passion, a young\nknight's heart flowered and blossomed in the moment of his permitted\ndevotion. It was with all the truth of my soul and my nature that I\nanswered:\n\n\"I do love you, oh, my gracious Queen. I hereby take all the vows you\nhave meted to me. I shall hold you ever, as I do now, in my very heart\nof hearts. I shall worship and cherish you till death parts us. I shall\nreverence and obey your every true wish; even as I have already promised\nbeside the sea and at the altar. And whithersoever my feet may go\nin obedience to your will, my Queen and my Love, they shall go on\nsteadfast, to the end.\" Here I stopped, for I feared to try to say more;\nI was trembling myself and the words were choked in my throat. Marjory\nbent over as I knelt, laid her wand on my shoulder and said:\n\n\"Rise up, Sir Archibald, my own True Knight and Loyal Lover!\" Before I\nrose I wanted to kiss her hand, but as I bent, her foot was temptingly\nnear. I stooped lower to kiss it. She saw my intention and saying\nimpulsively: \"Oh, Archie dear, not that wet, dirty shoe,\" kicked it off.\nI stooped still lower and kissed her bare foot.\n\nAs I looked up at her face adoringly, a blush swept over it and left her\npale; but she did not flinch. Then I stood up and she stepped down from\nher throne, and into my arms. She laid her head against my shoulder, and\nfor a few moments of ecstasy our hearts beat together.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXV\n\nTHE POPE'S TREASURE\n\n\n\"Now,\" said Marjory, at last disengaging herself from me, \"let us get\ndown to business. We've got to find the treasure, you know!\" So we set\nourselves down to a systematic search.\n\nWe explored one after another all the caves leading out of the main\ncavern. Some of them were narrow and tortuous; some were wide and low\nwith roof dropping down, down, until it was impossible for anything in\nthe shape of humanity to pass. All these, however, with one exception,\nended in those fissure-like clefts, running somewhere to a point, which\ncharacterise cavern formations. The exception was at the north west side\nof the cavern where a high, fairly wide passage extended, with an even\nfloor as though it too had been levelled by rolling pebbles. It kept on\nstraight for a good length, and then curved round gently to the right,\nall the while fairly maintaining its proportions. Presently it grew so\nhigh that it was like a narrow way between tall houses. I lit a white\nlight, and in the searching glare noticed that far overhead the rocky\nwalls leaned together till they touched. This spot, just above us, was\nevidently the highest point; the roof thence fell rapidly till at last\nit was only some ten feet high. A little further on it came to a sudden\nend.\n\nHere there was a great piled-up mass of huge, sharp-edged rocks, at the\nbase of which were stones of all sizes, some round and some jagged.\nScattered near and isolated were many stones rounded by constant\nfriction.\n\nAs I looked, the whole circumstances seemed to come to me. \"See,\" I\ncried to Marjory, \"this was evidently another entrance to the cave. The\ntides, ebbing or flowing, drove in through one way and out at the other;\nand the floor was worn level in process of countless years by rolling\npebbles like these. Then came some upheaval or wearing away by water\ndrift of supporting walls of rock; and this mouth of the cave fell in.\nWe must be by now somewhere at the Cruden side of Whinnyfold; we are\nfacing almost due north.\"\n\nAs there was manifestly nothing to be done here, we took our way back\nto the main cavern. When we began to look around us for a new place to\nexplore, Marjory said:\n\n\"There doesn't seem to be any treasure cave at all here. We have now\ntried everywhere.\" Then it was that my mind went back again to the Don's\ndescription \"Black on the one hand and red on the other.\" \"Come,\"\nI said, \"let us go back till we find the joining of the gneiss and\ngranite.\" As we went back the floor was almost dry; only a few pools of\nwater here and there, lying in the depressions, called attention to the\nfact that we were under tidal influence. As we went we kept a careful\nlook-out for the fusion of the rocks; and found it where the passage\nwith the descending roof debouched into that which led from the blocked\nup entrance of the cave. There was here, however, no sign of another\npassage, and the main one outside was like that under my own house,\nentirely through the gneiss.\n\nI could not help feeling a little disappointed. For many weeks my mind\nhad been set on finding the Pope's treasure; and though I believe it was\nnot greed which controlled me even to any great extent, I was deeply\nchagrined. I had a sort of unworthy fear that it might lower me in the\neyes of Marjory. This feeling, however, was only momentary; and when it\nwent, it went for good. Drawing in my note-book a rough outline of\nWhinnyfold, I dotted lines where I took the various branches of the cave\nto lie and then marked in the line of fusion of the gneiss and the\ngranite as it was manifest on the cliffs and on the shore beyond.\nMarjory was at once convinced; indeed when I saw my surmise put down in\nblack and white it seemed to me quite apparent that it must be correct.\nThe treasure cave must be within that space which lay between the\ndismantled entrance on the side of the Skares, and that which had fallen\nin on the north side. The logical inference was that if there was an\nentrance to be found at all it would be close to the debris from the\nDon's explosion. So we took in silence, our way back to that point and\nbegan at once to examine the debris for any sign of an opening in the\nrock to the north side. Marjory scrambled up to the top of the pile\nwhilst I explored the base. Turning my lantern on the rocky wall I began\nto examine it foot by foot and inch by inch.\n\nSuddenly Marjory cried out. I raised my head and looked at her. Her\nface, lit by the rays of my own lamp which, with the habit of searching\nnow familiar to me I had turned as my eyes turned, was radiant with joy\nand excitement.\n\n\"Look! look!\" she cried. \"Oh, Archie, there is the top of an opening\nhere. The stones fill it up.\" As she spoke she pushed at a stone on the\ntop of the pile; under her hand it moved and disappeared with a hollow\nrattle. By this time I had scrambled up the slippery pile and was beside\nher. The disappearance of the stone had enlarged the opening, and\nsomething like a foot square was discovered.\n\nSo we began to work at the heap of stones, only we pulled and threw\nthem into the cave where we were so as not to block the place we aimed\nat. The top layer of stones was easy to move, as they were comparatively\nsmall, and were not interlocked, but below them we found a much more\ndifficult task. Here the rocks were larger and more irregular in shape,\nand their points and edges interlocked. We did not mind, however, but\ntoiled on. I could not but notice as we did so, a trait of Marjory's\ncoolness of head in the midst of all her excitement, when she took from\nher pocket a pair of heavy gloves and put them on.\n\nIn some fifteen or twenty minutes we had unmasked a hole sufficiently\nlarge to pass through comfortably. I found that the oil of my lamp was\nrunning low; so I refilled it and Marjory's also. Then holding my own\nlamp carefully, whilst Marjory turned hers in the direction I was going,\nI passed over the top of the miniature moraine, and in a few seconds was\non the floor of the other cave. Marjory threw me the ball of string and\nscrambling down joined me at once. We went along carefully, for the roof\nof the cave dipped very low and we had in more than one place to bend\nconsiderably; even then we were walking in a couple of feet of water as\nthe floor dipped as well as the roof. When we had gone some distance,\nhowever, the roof rose as the cave turned sharp to the left, round a\ncorner of very broken and jagged rock in which I could see signs of the\nfusion of the two geological formations. Our hearts beat high and we\ntook hands instinctively; we were now confident that we were in the\ntreasure house at last.\n\nAs we went up the cave, here running, so far as I could ascertain by the\ncompass, straight in and from the sea, we could note, as we turned our\nlamps now and again to either side, that on our left was all black rock\nwhilst on the right was all red. The cave was not a long one; nothing\nto compare with those we had left. It was not very many seconds, though\nwe had to go slow as we did not know for certain as to the floor level,\nbefore the cave began to expand.\n\nWhen, however, it widened and became more lofty, the floor rose in all\nsome three feet and we went up a sharp incline though not of very great\nmagnitude. This dipped a little again forming a pool which spread ahead\nof us so far as we could see by the dim light of our bicycle lamps. As\nwe did not know the depth I waded in, Marjory enjoining me anxiously to\nbe careful. I found it deepened very slowly; so she joined me and we\nwent on together. By my advice, Marjory kept a few feet in the rear, so\nthat in case I should stumble or meet with a deep hole and so lose my\nlight, hers would still be safe. I was so intent on my feet, for I\nfeared lest Marjory following so close might get into some trouble, that\nI hardly looked ahead, but kept cautiously on my way. Marjory, who was\nflashing her lamp all around as she went, suddenly called out:\n\n\"Look! look! There to the right, the figure of the San Cristobal with\nthe golden Christ on his shoulder.\"\n\nI turned my lantern to the angles of the cave to the right to which we\nwere now close. The two lamps gave us light enough to see well.\n\nThere, rising from the water under the shelf of rock, was the figure\nthat Benvenuto had wrought, as Don Bernardino had left it three\ncenturies ago.\n\nAs I moved forwards I stumbled; in trying to save myself the lamp was\nshaken from my hand and fell hissing in the dark water. As it fell I saw\nby the flash of light the white bones of a skeleton under the San\nCristobal. Instinctively I called out to Marjory:\n\n\"Stand still and take care of your lamp; I've dropped mine!\"\n\n\"All right!\" came back her answer coolly; she had quite command of\nherself. She turned the lamp downwards, so that we could see into the\nwater, and I found I had stumbled against an iron box, beside which, in\nabout two feet of water, lay my lamp. I picked this up first and shook\nthe water from it and laid it on the shelf of rock. \"Wait here a\nmoment,\" I said, \"I shall run back and get a torch.\" For I had left the\ntin box on the top of the heap of debris when we had scrambled through\nthe hole. I was starting back at once when she said after me, and\nin that cave the voice came after me \"monotonous and hollow like a\nghost's:\"\n\n\"Take my lamp with you dear. How can you find the box, or even the way\nto it, in the dark?\"\n\n\"But I can't leave you alone here; all in the dark, too.\"\n\n\"Oh, I'm all right,\" she answered gaily, \"I don't mind a bit! And\nbesides it will be a new sensation to be here alone--with Olgaref and\nthe treasure. You won't be long, will you, dear?\" I felt that her query\nalmost belied her brave words; but I knew that behind the latter lay her\npride which I must not offend; so I took the lamp she was holding out to\nme and hurried on. In a few minutes I had found the box and brought it\nback; but I could see that even those minutes had been a trying time\nto Marjory, who was deathly white. When I came close, she clung to me;\nafter a second or two she said, as she drew herself away, looking at me\ndiffidently as though to excuse herself, or rather to account for her\nperturbation:\n\n\"The moment you had gone and I was alone in the dark with the treasure,\nall the weird prophecying of Gormala came back to me. The very darkness\nitself made light patches, and I saw shrouds floating everywhere. But\nit's all right now that you are here. Light a torch, and we shall look\nat the Pope's treasure.\" I took a torch out of the box and lit it; she\nlaid it so that the lighted end projected well beyond the shelf of rock\nand gave a fine if fitful, light to all around. We found water about\nthree feet deep at its worst; in the glare of the torch and because of\nits crystal purity, it did not look even so much. We stooped down to\nexamine the box, which was only one of several lying in front of a great\nheap of something, all dark with rust and age, which filled up a whole\ncorner of the cave.\n\nThe hasp was eaten through with rust, as well it might be after three\ncenturies in the water, and only retained its form. This was doubtless\ndue to the stillness of the water, for even the shock of my striking the\nbox with my boot had broken it across. When I pulled at it, it crumbled\nto pieces in my fingers. In the same way the iron of the box itself was\nrusted right through; and as I tried to lift the lid which was annealed\nby corrosion to the sides of the box, it broke in my hands. I was able\nto tear it away like matchwood. The contents were not corroded, but were\nblackened by the sea. It was all money, but whether silver or gold we\ncould not tell, and did not stop to see. Then we opened box after box in\nthe same way, and in all but one found coins. This took a considerable\ntime; but we did not in our excitement note its flying. The heap in\nthe corner was composed of great ingots, to lift any of which took a\ndistinct effort of strength. The one box unfilled with coins contained\nsmaller boxes or caskets which were uncorroded and were, we presumed, of\nsome superior metal, silver or gold. They were all locked; I lifted one\nof them and laid it on the shelf of rock whilst I searched for a key. It\nwas a difficult matter to find any definite thing whilst stooping in the\nwater, so I took my knife and tried with its point to prise open the\ncasket. The lock must have been of iron and corroded; it gave way\ninstantly under pressure, disclosing a glittering heap of stones which,\neven through all the cloudiness of the saline deposit of centuries,\nflashed red lights everywhere.\n\n\"Rubies!\" cried Marjory who stood close to me, clapping her hands. \"Oh!\nhow lovely. Darling!\" she added kissing me, for her expression of\ndelight had to find a vent on something.\n\n\"Next!\" I said as I bent to the iron chest to lift out another of the\ncaskets.\n\nI drew back with a shudder; Marjory looking anxiously at my face divined\nthe cause and cried in genuine alarm:\n\n\"The tide! The tide is rising; and is shutting us in!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVI\n\nTHE RISING TIDE\n\n\nI think there must be some provision of nature which in times of real\ndanger keeps men's minds away from personal fears. I can honestly say\nthat not a thought of danger for myself crossed my mind; though I was\nharrowed up and appalled by fears for Marjory. My mental excitement,\nhowever, took a practical shape, and thought after thought flashed\nthrough my brain as to how I could best serve my wife. The situation\nwith its woeful possibilities came first; and afterwards, in quick\nsuccession, the efforts which might be made. But first I must see how we\nreally stood. I did not know this cave and the lengths and levels of it\nwell enough to be sure whether the tide could block us completely in. If\nthere were but head-room the actual distance was not far to swim. This\nI could soon settle; taking Marjory's lamp which stood on the ledge of\nrock I ran down the cave calling out as I went:\n\n\"Stay here a minute, dear, I want to see how far the tide is in.\" The\ndouble winding of the cave made it hard for me to judge at a glance; it\nwas only when I came to the piece of straight passage leading up from\nthe sea that I could judge. From the time I left the treasure chamber of\nthe cave the water got deeper and deeper as I went, but the difficulty\nwas not in this way; I knew that so long as there was headway I could\nswim for it and take Marjory with me. But when I came down the straight,\nmy hopes were altogether dashed. As the floor dipped towards the sea so\ndid the roof in much greater degree. I knew that there was one place\nwhere at low water there was only barely headway even when we stooped\nlow; but I was not prepared for what I saw. The water had already risen\nso far that this place was, from where I stood waist high in water,\nobliterated; the rocky roof sank into the still, level water. For a\nmoment I considered whether it would not be best to dive through it. I\nhad the cord to guide me, and I knew that towards its mouth the cave\nroof rose again. But then there was Marjory. She was not like myself an\naccomplished diver. It might be possible if the worst should come to\nthe worst to draw her through the water-choked piece of tunnel by the\nguiding cord. But if the cord should break or anything go wrong.... The\nthought was too dreadful! I hurried back to Marjory to see how far it\nmight be advisable to make the attempt, however dangerous, rather than\nbe drowned in the deepening water of the cave, or asphyxiated if the\nspace left were too small to allow us breathing till the falling of the\ntide.\n\nI found Marjory standing on the shelf of rock, to which she had climbed\nby the aid of the San Cristobal figurehead. She was holding up the torch\nand examining carefully the walls and roof of the cave. When she heard\nthe splash of my coming through the water, she turned; I could see that\nthough her face was pale she was very calm and self-possessed. She said\nquietly:\n\n\"I have been looking for high-water mark, but I can hardly see any sign\nof it. I suppose in this dark cave, where neither seaweed nor zoophyte\nexists, there is no such thing. Unless of course it be that the whole\ncave is under the water line; in which case we must be ready for\nthe worst.\" As she spoke she was raising the torch till its light\nilluminated, so far as was possible, the extreme angle of the cavern\nwhere it ran up to a sort of point. I scrambled up beside her, and\nmaking use of my greater height, took the torch and keeping it away\nat arm's length put my hand into the narrowing angle. I had a sort of\nsecret hope that there might be some long crack or rift which, though it\nmight be impossible for our bodies, might still give us air. Any such\nhalf-formed hope was soon shattered; the angle of the cave was in the\nsolid rock, and there was no fissure or even crack beyond.\n\nAs there was no clue to the level reached by the tide, I tried back on\nthe possibility of gauging it by measuring from low water, so far as my\nmemory of the tides might serve. Judging by the depth of the water, so\nfar as I had gone, the fall of the floor level must here have been some\nthree feet. The floor level of the cave was almost that of low water,\nexcept where it dipped under the overhanging roof, or where was the\nascending grade up to the pool in which the treasure boxes lay. As here\non the border of the North Sea, with no estuary to increase tidage, the\nnormal rise of the tide is between eleven and twelve feet, we had to\naccount for another eight or nine feet for the rise of the tide.\nThe ledge was about a foot above the surface of the water. If my\ncalculations were correct there was head room and breathing space, for\nas I stood on the ledge the top of my head was still about two feet from\nthe highest point of roof over us. I could not, however, be certain of\nmy calculations, within a couple of feet. If, therefore, we could keep\nour place on the shelf of rock and endure the cold we might yet win\nthrough. The cold was a serious matter. At Cruden where the full sweep\nof the icy current from the North Sea runs in shore, the water is\ngrievously cold, even in the hottest summer time. Already we were\nfeeling the effects of our wet clothes, even in this silent cavern where\nthe heat seemed to be much more than outside. When we had been looking\nat the jewels, I had myself felt the chill, and could feel Marjory\nshiver now and again. Indeed, I had been about to suggest our returning\nwhen I made the discovery of the rising tide.\n\nIt was no use regretting, however. We were caged in the cavern; and our\nonly chance was to hold on somehow, till the tide should fall again. The\npractical side of Marjory's mind was all awake. It was she who quietly\nrefilled the two lamps, and, with much spluttering of the wick at first,\nlighted again the one which I had let fall into the water. When both\nlamps were ready, she put out the torch and placed it in the tin box\nwhich she handed to me, saying:\n\n\"We may need all the air we can get for our breathing, and the torches\nwould burn it up. We must have two lamps lest one should fail. Shove the\nbox as far as it will go into the corner of the cave; it will be safe\nthere--as safe as us at any rate, for it will be over our heads.\"\n\nAs she spoke a new idea occurred to me. I might raise the level of the\nledge by piling the ingots on it! I did not lose any time, but jumping\ndown began at once to lift them one by one on the ledge. It was heavy\nwork, and no one but a very strong man could have lifted them from off\nthe ground, much less have placed them on a ledge over where he stood.\nMoreover I had to bend into the water to reach them, and in the years\nwhich they had lain there in juxtaposition some deposit of salt or sea\nlime of some kind had glued them together. After the separation of the\nfirst, however, this difficulty grew less. Marjory aided me in placing\nthe bars in position; when they were once fixed their great weight kept\nthem in place.\n\nIt was odd how little in these moments the treasure counted for. The\nlittle heap of rubies lay on the shelf of rock unnoticed, and when in\nthe strain of placing the ingots some of them were brushed off into the\nwater, neither Marjory nor I took the trouble even to sweep them with\na brush of the hand into a safer place. One of the metal caskets was\ntumbled bodily into the water without a thought.\n\nWhen the ingots were all in place, and shaken into steady position,\nwe got on the ledge together and began to test the security of our\nplatform; it would be too late to find out any flaw of construction when\nthe tide should have risen. We had made a foothold nearly two feet\nabove the surface of the ledge, and this might give us at the last an\nadditional chance. At any rate, even if we should not be so hard pressed\nas to have to raise our heads so high, it would give us a longer period\nof comparative dryness. We were already beginning to feel the chill\nof the tide. In those caves the air is all right, and we had not felt\nchilled, although we were more or less wet through; but I dreaded lest\nit might numb either of us so much as to prevent our taking every\nchance. When we stood together on the pile of gold and silver, our heads\nwere so close to the roof that I felt safe so far as actually drowning\nor asphyxiation were concerned if the tide did not rise higher than\nI had computed. If we could only hold out till the tide had fallen\nsufficiently, we might get back.\n\nAnd then we began the long, dreary wait for the rising tide. The time\nseemed endless, for our apprehension and suspense multiplied the real\ndanger whatever it might be. We stood on the cave floor till the water\nhad reached our waists, and all this time tried to keep moving, to\ndance up and down, to throw about arms and legs so as to maintain the\ncirculation of the blood. Then we climbed up and sat on the platform of\nbullion till the water rose round our knees again. Then we stood on the\nledge and took what exercise we could till the water climbed up over our\nfeet and knees. It was a terrible trial to feel the icy, still water\ncreep up, and up, and up. There was not a sound, no drip or ripple of\nwater anywhere; only silence as deadly as death itself. Then came the\ntime when we had to stand together on the pile of bullion which we had\nbuilt up. We stood close, for there was merely foothold; I held Marjory\nup as well as I could, so as to lessen for her the strain of standing\nstill. Our hearts beat together. We felt it, and we knew it; it was only\nthe expression of both our thoughts when Marjory said:\n\n\"Thank God! dear, at the worst we can die together.\" In turn we held the\nlamp well over the water, and as we looked in aching suspense we saw the\ndark flood rise up to the sloping roof of the cave and steal towards us\nwith such slow, relentless precision that for my own part I felt I must\nscream. I felt Marjory tremble; the little morsel of hysterics which\ngoes to make up the sum total of every woman was beginning to assert\nitself. Indeed there was something hypnotic in that silent line of death\ncreeping slowly towards us. At this time, too, the air began to feel\nless fresh. Our own breaths and the exhalations of the lamp was\nvitiating our breathing space. I whispered to Marjory:\n\n\"We must put out the light!\" She shuddered, but said with as brave a\nvoice as she could:\n\n\"All right! I suppose it is necessary. But, darling, hold me tight and\ndo not let me away from you, or I shall die!\"\n\nI let the lantern fall into the water; its hissing for a moment drowned\nmy own murmur of grief and Marjory's suppressed groan.\n\nAnd now, in the darkness, the terror of the rising flood grew worse and\nworse. The chill water crept up, and up, and up; till at last it was\nonly by raising her head that Marjory could breathe. I leaned back\nagainst the rock and bending my legs outward lifted her so that she\nrested her feet upon my knees. Up and up rose the chill water till it\nreached my chin, and I feared that the last moments had come.\n\nThere was one chance more for Marjory: and though it cut me to the soul\nto speak it, for I knew it would tear at her very heartstrings, I had to\ntry it:\n\n\"Marjory, my wife, the end is close! I fear we may not both live. In a\nfew minutes more, at most, the water will be over my mouth. When that\ntime comes I shall sink over the pile of treasure on which we rest. You\nmust then stand on me; it will raise you sufficiently to let you hold\nout longer.\" A dreadful groan broke from her.\n\n\"Oh, my God!\" was all she said, but every nerve in her body seemed to\nquiver. Then without a word she seemed to become limp and was sliding\nout of my arms. I held her up strongly, for I feared she had swooned:\nshe groaned out:\n\n\"Let me go, let me go! Either of us can rest on the other's body. I\nshall never leave this if you die.\"\n\n\"Dear one\" I said \"do as I wish, and I shall feel that even death will\nbe a happy thing, since it can help you.\" She said nothing but clung to\nme and our mouths met. I knew what she meant; if die we must, we should\ndie together in a kiss.\n\nIn that lover's kiss our very souls seemed to meet. We felt that the\nGates of the Unknown World were being unbarred to us, and all its\nglorious mysteries were about to be unveiled. In the impassive stillness\nof that rising tide, where never a wave or ripple broke the dreadful,\nsilent, calm, there was no accidental fall or rise which might give\nadded uneasiness or sudden hope. We had by this time become so far\naccustomed to its deadly perfection as to accept its conditions. This\nrecognition of inevitable force made for resignation; and I think that\nin those moments both Marjory and I realised the last limitations of\nhumanity. When one has accepted the inevitable, the mere act of dying is\neasy of accomplishment.\n\nBut there is a contra to everything in the great ledgers of the Books\nof Life and Death, and it is only a final balance which counts for gain\nor loss. The very resignation which makes the thought of death easy\nto bear, is but a balance of power which may not be gainsayed. In the\nstruggle of hope and despair the Winged One submits, and that is all.\nHis wings are immortal; out of fire or water, or pestilence, or famine,\nor the red mist of battle they ever rise again, when once there is light\nof any kind to animate them.\n\nEven when Marjory's mouth was bent to mine in a fond kiss of love and\ndeath, the wings of Hope fluttered around her head. For an instant or\ntwo she paused, as if listening or waiting, and then with a glad cry,\nwhich in that narrow space seemed to ring exultingly, she said:\n\n\"You are saved! You are saved! The water is falling; it has sunk below\nyour lips.\" Even in that dread moment of life and death, I could not but\nbe touched by her way of rejoicing in the possibility of our common\nsafety. Her only thought was for me.\n\nBut her words were true. The tide had reached its full; the waters were\nfalling. Minute by minute we waited, waited in breathless suspense;\nclinging to each other in an ecstasy of hope and love. The chill which\nhad been upon us for so long, numbing every sense and seeming to make\nany idea of effort impossible, seemed to have lost its power. In the new\nquickening of hope, our hearts seemed to beat more warmly, till the\nblood tingled in our veins. Oh! but the time was long, there in the\ndark, with the silent waters receding inch by inch with a slowness which\nwas inconceivable. The strain of waiting became after a while almost\nunbearable; I felt that I must speak to Marjory, and make her speak and\nkeep speaking, lest we should both break down, even at the very last. In\nthe time of our waiting for death we had held on to our determination,\nblindly resolute to struggle to the last; even though we had accepted\nthe inevitable. But now there was impatience added to our apprehension.\nWe did not know the measure of our own endurance; and Terror seemed to\nbrood over us with flapping wings.\n\nTruly, the moments of coming Life are longer than hours of coming\nDeath.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVII\n\nROUND THE CLOCK\n\n\nWhen the water had fallen so far that we could sit on the ledge, we\nrested for a few minutes to relieve the long and terrible strain of\nstanding, cramped and chilled as we were. But we soon felt the chill of\nthe water and stood again till the rocky ledge was quite free. Then we\nenjoyed a rest, if the word \"enjoyment\" could be applied to our wearied,\nteeth-chattering, exhausted condition. I made Marjory sit on my lap, so\nthat we could get some warmth together, and that she might be saved from\nthe benumbing coldness of the rock. We wrung out our clothes as well as\nwe could, and with braver hearts set ourselves down to the second spell\nof our dark captivity. Well we knew that the tide had risen higher than\nthe tin box in the corner of the cave, and tacitly put off the moment of\nassured knowledge. Presently when the chill had somewhat passed from her\nand she shivered less, she stood up and tried to get down the box. She\ncould not reach it, so I rose and took it down. Then we resumed our\nplaces on the ledge, and, with the box beside us, began to investigate.\n\nIt was a sadly helpless performance. In the dark everything seemed\nstrange, with regard to size as well as to shape. Our wet hands could\nnot of themselves discriminate as to whether anything was wet or dry.\nIt was only when we found that the box was quite full of water that we\nrealised that there was no hope of light in this quarter, and that we\nmust have patience through the darkness as well as we could. I think\nthat Marjory cried a little. She covered it up for me in some womanly\nway. But there are eyes in the soul that can see even through cimmerian\ngloom; and I knew that she cried, though my senses could detect no sign.\nWhen I touched her face, my wet hands and my own wet face could tell me\nnothing. Still we were happy in a way. The fear of death had passed, and\nwe were only waiting for light and warmth. We knew that every minute,\nevery breath we drew, the tide was falling; and we knew too that we\ncould grope our way through the cavern. We rejoiced now that there was\nno labyrinth of offshoots of the cave; and we were additionally glad\nthat our clue, the cord which we had taken with us, remained. We could\neasily pick it up when we should begin to move, for there was no stir of\nwater to shift it and draw it away.\n\nWhen we thought that a sufficient time must have elapsed, even at the\ndeadly slow pace at which it crawled, we kissed each other and began our\nfirst effort to escape.\n\nWe easily found the cord, and keeping hold of it, felt our way slowly\nalong the rugged wall. I made Marjory keep close behind me, a little to\nthe right, for I was feeling way by the left hand alone. I feared lest\nshe should get bruised by the jagged rock which protruded here and\nthere. It was well I did so, for in the first dozen yards I got some\nsevere knocks that might have permanently scarred her tender skin. The\nexperience made me careful, however, and after it I took care to feel my\nway all round before advancing a step. I found by experience that it was\nthe cord which had misled me by straining where there was a curve or an\nangle, and so taking me close to the rock instead of in the middle of\nthe passage where we had originally dropped it as we went along.\n\nWhen we had passed the first two bends, the anxious time came; it was\nhere that the roof dropped, and we did not know if the tide had fallen\nlow enough to let us through. We pushed on however into the deepening\nwater, Marjory still keeping close behind me, though I wished to go on\nalone and explore. We found that the rock dipped below the water level\nwhen we had gone some way into the tunnel. So we came back and waited\na good while--it seemed a long, long time. Then we essayed again, and\nfound that though the water was still high there were some inches of\nspace between rock and water.\n\nJoyfully we pushed on slowly; our hearts beat gladly when we could raise\nour heads from the stooping position and raise them freely in the air.\nIt only took us a few minutes to reach the pile of rocks; then holding\nthe cord as a clue to the narrow opening we scrambled up as well as we\ncould. I helped Marjory as much as possible, but in this matter she\nwas as good as I was; nay better, for all her woman's instinct came to\naid, and it was she who first got through the narrow hole. Then very\ncarefully we climbed down the other side, and, still holding our guiding\ncord, came at last to the tackle by which we had lowered ourselves into\nthe cave. It was rather a surprise to us when we reached it, for we\nexpected to see the welcome light through the opening before we had come\nunder it.\n\nAt first, in the whirl of thoughts, I imagined that something had gone\nwrong, a rock fallen in, or some sort of general collapse. Then I\nfancied that we had been tracked down, and that some one had tried to\nbury us in the cave. It is wonderful what strange thoughts come to\none in a prolonged spell of absolute darkness; no wonder that even\nlow-grade, violent, unimaginative criminals break down in the black\nhole! Marjory said nothing; but when she spoke, it was evident from her\nwords that she had some of the same ideas herself. There was a tone of\nrelief in her voice which was unmistakable, and which must have followed\nsome disconcerting thought:\n\n\"Of course not! It is only that the lamps and candles have burned\nout. We have forgotten the long time which has passed; but the lights\nhaven't!\" It was evident enough now. We had been so many hours in the\ncave that the lights were exhausted; and at no time was there a gleam of\nnatural light in the cellar.\n\nI found it a little difficult to work the tackle in the dark with my\nnumbed hands. Hope, however, is a paramount force, and very soon Marjory\nwas swinging up through the hole in the rock. I called to her to get\nlight as soon as she could; but she refused point blank to do anything\nuntil I was beside her. When I got the rope round me, we both pulled;\nand in a very few seconds I too was up through the hole and in the\ncellar. I found the matches easily enough and oh! the glorious sight of\nthe light even in this spluttering form. We did not linger an instant\nbut moved to the door, which I unlocked, and we stepped out and ran\nup the steps. The lantern on the roof which lit the staircase was all\nablaze with sunshine, and we felt bathed in light. For a second or two\nwe could not realise it, and blinked under the too magnificent glare.\n\nAnd then, with inconceivable rapidity, we came back to the serenity and\nconfidence which comes with daylight. In less than a second we were\nagain in the realities of life; and the whole long night of darkness and\nfear was behind us like a dream.\n\nI hurried Marjory into the room where she had dressed, and where were\na store of her clothes; and then I proceeded to make up a fire. The\nchimney place in the dining room was made after the old fashion, wide\nand deep, and had in the back a beautiful old steel rack with brackets\non which to hang pots and kettles. I thought this would be the best\nplace for a fire, as it was the biggest in the house. So I got from\nthe fuel house off the kitchen an armful of dry furze and another of\ncut billets of pine which I dumped on top of it. A single match was\nsufficient, and in an instant, there was a large fire roaring up the\nchimney. I filled a great copper kettle with water and slung it in the\nblaze, and then, when I found myself in a cloud of steam from my wet\nclothes, ran into my own room. After a hard rub down which made my skin\nglow, and a wash which was exquisite, I put myself into dry clothes.\nWhen I came back to the dining room I found Marjory busy getting ready\na meal--supper, breakfast, dinner, we did not know what to call it.\nOne glad moment in each other's arms, and then kneeling together we\nthanked God for the great mercy which He had shown us. Then we resumed\npreparations to eat, for we were ravenous. The kettle was beginning to\nsing, and we soon had hot delicious tea, which sent a glow through us.\nThere were plenty of cooked provisions, and we did not wait to warm\nthem: such luxuries as hot food would come into our lives later. It was\nonly when we had satisfied our appetites that we thought of looking at\nthe time. My own watch had stopped when I had first tried the entrance\nto the great cave and had been waist high in water, but Marjory had left\nhers in her room when she had changed her dress for the expedition. It\nwas now one o'clock and as the sun was high in the heavens it was--P.\u00c2\u00a0M.\nAllowing for the time of dressing and eating, we must have been in all\nin the caves some twelve hours. I looked amongst my books and found\nWhittaker's Almanach, from which I gathered that as the tide was full at\nhalf past six o'clock we must as the normal rise of the tide was between\neleven and twelve feet have been immersed in the water some four hours.\nThe very thought of it made us shudder; with an instinctive remembrance\nof our danger and misery we drew close together.\n\nThen a heavy sleepiness seemed all at once to settle on us. Marjory\nwould not leave me, and I did not wish her to. I felt, as she did, that\nwe could not sleep easily if separated. So I got great armloads of rugs\nand cushions and made up two nests close to the fire which I built up\nwith solid logs. I wrapped her in a great, warm plaid and myself in\nanother, and we sank down on our couches, holding hands and with her\nhead upon my shoulder.\n\nWhen I woke it was almost pitch dark; only for a slight glow which came\nfrom the mass of red embers on the hearth the darkness would have been\nas complete as that of the cave. It is true that the sunblinds were down\nand the curtains drawn; but even so, when there was light outside some\ngleams of it even, if only reflected, found their way in. Marjory was\nstill sleeping as I stole softly to the window and looked out.\n\nAll was dark. The moon was hidden behind a bank of cloud, only the edges\nof which tinged with light showed its place in the heavens. I looked at\nMarjory's watch which she had laid upon the table, having wound it up\ninstinctively before the sleepiness had come upon her. It was now a few\nminutes past one.\n\nWe had slept right round the clock.\n\nI began to make up the fire as softly as I could, for I did not wish to\nwake Marjory. I felt that sleep and plenty of it was the best thing for\nher after the prolonged strain and trial which she had undergone. I got\nready clean plates and knives and forks, and put on the kettle again.\nWhilst I was moving about, she woke. For an instant or two she looked\nround in a dazed uncomprehending way; and then all at once the whole\nremembrance of the night swept across her. In a single bound, with the\nagility of a young panther, she sprang to her feet, and in an instant\nher arms were round me, half protectingly and whole lovingly.\n\nWe had another hearty meal. It was pic-nic-ing _in excelsis_, and I\ndoubt if the whole world held two happier beings. Presently we began to\ntalk of the cave and of the treasure, and I was rejoiced to find that\nall the trial and anxiety had left no trace on Marjory's courage. It was\nshe herself who suggested that we should go back to the cave and take\nout what she called those dear little boxes. We put on once more our\ncave clothes, which were dry again but which had shrunk lamentably, and\nlaughing at each other's grotesque appearance we went down into the\ncellar again. Having renewed the lamps and made all safe for our return,\nwe took lamps and torches and matches and set out on our quest. I think\nwe both felt a little awed--we were certainly silent--as we crept\nthrough the hole over the moraine and took our way up the treasure cave.\nI confess that my own heart sank within me when we saw the ledge, with\nthe San Cristobal and the infant Christ seeming to keep guard upon it;\nand I felt a pity, which I had not felt before, for the would-be thief,\nOlgaref. Marjory I think felt the same way as I did, for she kept very\nclose to me and now and again held on to me; but she said nothing. We\nlit a torch and renewed our search. Whilst I stooped over the box and\ntook out other caskets containing gems, Marjory held the light with one\nhand whilst she gathered the little heap of rubies from the first box\nand put them in the pocket of my jacket. Her feminine care was shown\nin her searching for the box and the rubies which had fallen into the\nwater so that none might be lost. There were not many of the little\ncaskets--it is astounding what a small space will contain a many\nprecious gems. They easily fitted into the bag which I had brought for\nthe purpose. Then we took our way back to the house.\n\nWhen we had ascended, we put out the lights and locked the cellar. We\nchanged our clothes again, Marjory putting on her livery; it was now\nnearly four o'clock in the morning, and it was time to be getting back\nto Crom.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVIII\n\nTHE DUTY OF A WIFE\n\n\nJust as we were about to start Marjory said to me, half in jest but\nwholly in earnest:\n\n\"I wonder what has become of Gormala these times. If she knew of the\nlast two nights, she would simply become desperate; and there is no\nknowing what she might prophecy!\"\n\nStrangely enough, I had been myself thinking of the Witch-woman. I\nsuppose it was that the memory of the finding of the treasure, and\nof the hovering near us of death, had recalled her weirds. With the\nthought of her, came once more that strange feeling which I had before\nexperienced, a feeling as if she were present. Motioning to Marjory to\nput out the light, I stole to the window. The heavy curtains, when I had\npassed through them, shut out the glimmer of the firelight. Marjory came\nand joined me, and we looked out together. There were drifting clouds,\nand thus, moments of light and shadow. In one of the former I saw a dark\nmass on the edge of the deep grass that crowns the rock just over the\nentrance of Witsennan Point. If it was a woman it was probably Gormala;\nand if it was Gormala she was probably watching me, for of course she\ncould not know that Marjory was with me. I determined to find out if I\ncould; so I told Marjory to slip out by the back door whilst I went to\nthe point. We arranged to join at the upper village of old Whinnyfold.\n\nHaving placed my bicycle ready to start, and shut the door behind me\nsoftly, I stole over to the cliff. Lying just below the edge, but so\nthat her head was at the top lay Gormala, asleep. At first I thought\nit was pretence, for I knew the wily nature of the old woman; but on\nexamining closely I found her sleep was real. She looked worn and tired\nout, and I concluded that it was the second night of watching on end\nwhich had finished her. It was well she slept, for had she been awake\nshe must have seen us. The place she had chosen commanded both paths\naway from the house left and right; only by stealing back over the hill\nand keeping the house all the time between us and herself could we have\navoided her prying eyes. Even then, were there light enough, she might\nhave seen us debouching on the roadway had we gone inland by Whinnyfold.\nI could not but be sorry for her; she looked so old and feeble, and\nyet with such purpose in her strong, stern face. I could afford to be\npitiful now; my life was running on happy lines. I had won Marjory, and\nwe had found the treasure!\n\nI left her undisturbed; I would have put some rug or covering over her;\nbut I was afraid lest I should awake her, and so make discovery of our\nplans. Besides it would be hard to account for my being awake myself and\nabout at that hour of the night--or morning, I hardly knew which it was.\nAlmost as hard as it would have been for Gormala to explain why she was\nin similar case.\n\nWhen I joined Marjory, we took our way as quickly as possible to\nCrom; we were both anxious that she should get into the castle before\ndaylight. It was with a certain dread, for the experiences of the night\nwere not yet hardened in memory, that I saw Marjory descend into the\ncave when we rolled away the stone. She too was not free from misgiving;\nI knew it from the emphasis with which she impressed on me that I was\nnot to fear for her. She was to wave a white handkerchief from the roof\nwhen she had got in safely.\n\nLooking over the stone towards the castle whence must come her signal I\nwaited with an anxiety which I could not conceal from myself. The grey\ndawn grew paler and paler as I looked, and the sky began to quicken.\nHere and there around me came every now and again the solitary pipe of\nan awakening bird. I could just see the top of the castle, looking bare\nand cold through the vista between the treetops. In a short time, almost\nshorter than I could have anticipated, I saw on the roof the flutter of\na white handkerchief. My heart leaped; Marjory was safe. I waved my own\nhandkerchief; she answered again, and there was no more sign. I came\naway satisfied, and wheeled back to Cruden with what speed I could. It\nwas still very early morning, when I reached Whinnyfold. Not a soul was\nup as I passed on my way, and I crept in secretly by the back of the\nhouse.\n\nWhen I looked carefully out of a window in front, I could see in the\ngrowing light of morning that Gormala still lay on the edge of the\ncliff, motionless and manifestly asleep.\n\nI lay down for a while and dozed till the morning was sufficiently\nadvanced. Then after a cold bath and a cup of hot tea, took my way to\nCrom, timing myself so as to arrive for an early breakfast.\n\nMrs. Jack met me, beaming. She was so hearty, and so manifestly glad to\nsee me, that I bent over and kissed her. She was not a bit displeased;\nshe seemed a little touched by the act, and smiled at me. Then Marjory\ncame in, looking radiant. She greeted me with a smile, and went over to\nand kissed Mrs. Jack affectionately. Then she kissed me too, and there\nwas a glad look in her eyes which made my heart thrill.\n\nAfter breakfast she sat in the window with Mrs. Jack, and I went to the\nfireplace to light a cigarette. I stood with my back to the fire and\nlooked over at Marjory; it was always a joy to me when she was in my\nsight. Presently she said to Mrs. Jack:\n\n\"Weren't you frightened when I didn't come back the night before last?\"\nThe elderly lady smiled complacently as she answered:\n\n\"Not a bit, my dear!\" Marjory was astonished into an exclamation:\n\n\"Why not?\" The affectionate old woman looked at her gravely and\ntenderly:\n\n\"Because I knew you were with your husband; the safest place where a\nyoung woman can be. And oh! my dear, I was rejoiced that it was so; for\nI was beginning to be anxious, and almost unhappy about you. It didn't\nseem right or natural for two young people like you and your husband to\nbe living, one in one place and one in another.\" As she spoke she took\nMarjory's hand in hers and stroked it lovingly. Marjory turned her\nhead away from her, and, after one swift glance at me from under her\neyelashes, from me also. Mrs. Jack went on in a grave, sweet way,\nlecturing the girl she loved and that she had mothered; not as a woman\nlectures a child but as an old woman advises her junior:\n\n\"For oh! Marjory, my dear one, when a woman takes a husband she gives\nup herself. It is right that she should; and it is better too, for us\nwomen. How can we look after our mankind, if we're thinking of ourselves\nall the time! And they want a lot of looking after too, let me tell you.\nThey're only men after all--the dears! Your bringing-up, my child, has\nnot made you need them. But you would well understand it, if when you\nwas a child, you was out on the plains and among the mountains, like I\nwas; if you didn't know when you saw your daddy, or your brother, or\nyour husband go out in the morning whether you'd ever see him come back\nat night, or would see him brought back. And then, when the work was\nover, or the fight or whatever it might be, to see them come home all\ndirty and ragged and hungry, and may be sick or wounded--for the Indians\nmade a lot of harm in my time with their good old bows and their bad new\nguns--where would we women and girls have been. Or what sort of women\nat all at all, if we didn't have things ready for them! My dear, as I\nsuppose you know now, a man is a mighty good sort of a thing after all.\nHe may be cross, or masterful, or ugly to deal with when he has got his\nshirt out; but after all he's a man, and that's what we love them for.\nI was beginning to wonder if you was a girl at all, when I see you let\nyour husband go away from you day after day and you not either holdin'\nhim back, or goin' off with him, way the girls did in my time. I tell\nyou it would have been a queer kind of girl in Arizony that'd have let\nher man go like that, when once they had said the word together. Why, my\ndear, I lay awake half the night sayin' my prayers for the both of you,\nand blessin' God that He had sent you such a happiness as true love;\nwhen there might have been them that would have ben runnin' after your\nfortun' and gettin' on your weak side enough to throw dust in your eyes.\nAnd when in the grey of the dawn I looked into your room and found you\nhadn't come, why I just tip-toed back to my bed and went to sleep happy.\nAnd I was happy all day, knowin' you were happy too. And last night I\njust went to sleep at once and didn't bother my head about listenin' for\nyour comin'; for well I knew you wouldn't be home then. Ah! my dear,\nyou've done the right thing. At the least, your husband's wishes is as\nmuch as your own, seein' as how there's two of you. But a woman only\nlearns her true happiness when she gives up all her own wishes, and\nthinks only for her husband. And, mind you, child, it isn't givin' up\nmuch after all--at least we didn't think so in my time--when she pleases\nher husband that she loves, by goin' off to share his home.\"\n\nI listened full of deep emotion as the old lady spoke. I felt that every\nword she said was crystallised truth; and there was no questioning the\ndeep, earnest, loving-kindness of her intent. I was half afraid to look\nat Marjory lest I should disconcert her; so I turned round quietly till\nI faced the fireplace, and leaning on the plinth of it stole a glance in\nthe old oval mirror above. Marjory sat there with her hand in Mrs.\nJack's. Her head was bent, and there was a flush on her neck and arms\nwhich told its own story. I felt that she was silently crying, or very\nnear it; and a lump rose in my own throat. This was one of the crises in\nher life. It was so borne in upon me; and I knew its truth. We have all,\nas the Scotch say, to \"dree our own weird,\" this was a battle with her\nown soul which Marjory must fight alone. The old woman's wise words\nsounded a trumpet note of duty. She was face to face with it, and must\njudge for herself. Even with all my love, I could not help her. I stood\nsilent, scarcely daring to breathe lest I should disturb or distract\nher. I tried to efface myself, and for a few minutes did not even look\nin the mirror. The old woman too, knew the value of silence, for she sat\nstill; there was not even the rustle of her dress. At last I could hear\nMarjory's in-drawn breath, and looked in the mirror. Her attitude had\nnot changed, except that she had raised her head; I could tell by its\nproud poise that she was her own woman again. She still kept her face\naway; and there was the veil of recent tears over her sweet voice as she\nspoke tenderly:\n\n\"Thank you, dear. I am so glad you have spoken to me so freely and so\nlovingly.\" I could see from the motion of the two hands and her own\nwhitening knuckles that she was squeezing her companion's fingers.\nThen, after a few moments she rose quietly, and, still keeping her head\naverted, sailed quietly out of the room in her own graceful manner. I\ndid not stir; I felt that I could please her best by keeping quiet.\n\nBut oh! how my heart went with her in her course.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIX\n\nAN UNEXPECTED VISITOR\n\n\nI chatted with Mrs. Jack for a few minutes with what nonchalance I could\nmuster, for I wanted to cover up Marjory's retreat. I have not the\nfaintest idea what we talked about; I only know that the dear old lady\nsat and beamed on me, with her lips pursed up in thought, and went on\nwith her knitting. She agreed with everything I said, whatever it was.\nI longed to follow Marjory and comfort her. I could see that she was\ndistressed, though I did not know the measure of it. I waited patiently,\nhowever, for I knew that she would either come to me, or send me word to\njoin her when she wanted me.\n\nShe must have come back very quietly, almost tip-toe, for I had not\nheard a sound when I saw her in the doorway. She was beckoning to me,\nbut in such a manner that Mrs. Jack could not see her. I was about to\ngo quietly, but she held up a warning hand with five fingers outspread;\nfrom which I took it that I was to follow in five minutes.\n\nI stole away quietly, priding myself on the fact that Mrs. Jack did not\nnotice my departure; but on thinking the matter over later, I came to\nthe conclusion that the quiet old lady knew a good deal more of what was\ngoing on round her than appeared on the surface. Her little homily to\nMarjory on a wife's duty has set me thinking many a time since.\n\nI found Marjory, as I expected, in the Ladies' Room. She was looking\nout of the window when I came in. I took her in my arms for an instant,\nand she laid her head on my shoulder. Then she drew herself away, and\npointed to a great chair close by for me to sit down. When I was seated\nshe took a little stool, and placing it beside me, sat at my feet. From\nour position I had to look down at her, and she had to look up at me.\nOften and often since then have I recalled the picture she made, sitting\nthere in her sweet graceful simplicity. Well may I remember it, for\nthrough many and many an aching hour has every incident of that day,\nhowever trivial, been burned into my brain. Marjory leant one elbow\non the arm of my chair, and put the other hand in mine with a sweet\nconfiding gesture which touched me to the heart. Since our peril of two\nnights before, she was very, very dear to me. All the selfishness seemed\nto have disappeared from my affection for her, and I was her true lover\nas purely as it is given to a man to be. She wanted to speak; I could\nsee that it was an effort to do so, for her breast heaved a few times,\nas a diver breathes before making his downward leap. Then she mastered\nherself, and with infinite grace and tenderness spoke:\n\n\"I'm afraid I have been very selfish and inconsiderate. Oh! yes I have\"\nfor I was commencing a protest. \"I know it now. Mrs. Jack was quite\nright. It never occurred to me what a brute I have been; and you so\ngood to me, and so patient. Well, dear, that's all over now! I want\nto tell you, right here, that if you like I'll go away with you\nto-morrow--to-day if you wish; and we'll let every one know that we are\nmarried, and go and live together.\" She stopped, and we sat hand in hand\nwith our fingers clasping. I remained quite still with a calm that\namazed me, for my brain was in a whirl. But somehow there came to me,\neven as it had come to her, a sense of duty. How could I accept such a\nsweet sacrifice. The very gravity of her preparation for thought and\nspeech showed me that she was loth to leave the course on which she had\nentered. That she loved me I had no doubt; was it not for me that she\nwas willing to give it all up. And then my course of action rose clear\nbefore me. Instinctively I stood up as I spoke to her, and I felt that\nbig stalwart man as I was, the pretty self-denying girl at my feet ruled\nme, for she was more to me than my own wishes, my own hopes, my own\nsoul.\n\n\"Marjory, do you remember when you sat on the throne in the cave, and\ngave me the accolade?\" She bowed her head in acquiescence; her eyes\nfell, and her face and ears grew rosy pink. \"Well, when you dubbed me\nyour knight, and I took the vow, I meant all I said! Your touch on\nmy shoulder was more to me than if it had come from the Queen on her\nthrone, with all the glory of a thousand years behind her. Oh, my dear,\nI was in earnest--in earnest then, as I am in earnest now. I was, and\nam, your true knight! You are my lady; to serve, and make her feet walk\nin easy ways! It is a terrible temptation to me to take what you have\noffered as done, and walk straightway into Paradise in our new life.\nBut, my dear! my dear! I too can be selfish if I am tempted too far; and\nI must not think of my own wishes alone. Since I first saw your face\nI have dreamt a dream. That a time would come when you, with all the\nworld to choose from, would come to me of your own free will. When you\nwouldn't want to look back with regret at anything, done or undone. I\nwant you to be happy; to look forward only--unless the backward thought\nis of happiness. Now, if you give up your purpose and come to me with\nthe feeling that you have only made a choice, the regret that you did\nnot have the opportunity you longed for, may grow and grow, till--till\nit may become an unhappiness. Let me be sententious for a moment.\n'Remember Lot's wife' was not merely the warning of a fact; it touched a\ngreat allegory. You and I are young; we are both happy; we have all the\nworld before us, and numberless good things to thank God for. I want you\nto enjoy them to the full; and, my dear one, I will not stand in your\nway in anything which you may wish. Be free, Marjory, be quite free! The\ngirl I want beside my hearth is one who would rather be there than\nanywhere else in the wide world. Isn't that worth wishing for; isn't\nit worth waiting for? It may be selfish in the highest plane of\nselfishness; I suppose it is. But anyhow, it is my dream; and I love you\nso truly and so steadfastly that I am not afraid to wait!\"\n\nAs I spoke, Marjory looked at me lovingly, more and more. Then all at\nonce she broke down, and began to sob and cry as if her heart would\nbreak. That swept away in a moment all my self-command; I took her in my\narms and tried to comfort her. Kisses and sweet words fairly rained upon\nher. Presently she grew calm, and said as she gently disengaged herself:\n\n\"You don't know how well you argue. I'm nearer at this moment to giving\nup all my plans, than I ever thought I should be in my life. Wait a\nlittle longer, dear. Only a little; the time may be shorter than you\nthink. But this you may take for your comfort now, and your remembrance\nlater; that in all my life, whatever may come, I shall never forget your\ngoodness to me, your generosity, your love, your sympathy--your--! But\nthere, you are indeed my Knight; and I love you with all my heart and\nsoul!\" and she threw herself into my arms.\n\nWhen I left Crom after lunch the weather seemed to have changed. There\nwas a coldness in the air which emphasised the rustling of the dry\nleaves as they were swept by intermittent puffs of wind. Altogether\nthere was a sense of some presage of gloom--or disaster--of discontent,\nI knew not what. I was loth to part with Marjory, but we both felt it\nwas necessary I should go. I had not had my letters for three days; and\nbesides there were a thousand things to be attended to about the house\nat Whinnyfold. Moreover, we began to think of the treasure, the portable\npart of which--the jewels--was left almost open in the dining room. I\ndid not want to alarm Marjory by any dim fears of my own; I knew that,\nin any case, there might be a reaction from her present high spirits.\nThe remembrance of the trials and anxieties of the past few days would\ncome back to her in the silence of the night. She saw, however, with the\nnew eyes of her wifely love, that I was anxious about something; justly\ninferring that it was about her, she said to me quietly:\n\n\"You need not be alarmed about me, darling. I promise you I shall not\nstir out of the house till you come. But you will come as early as you\ncan to-morrow; won't you. Somehow, I don't like your leaving me now. I\nused not to mind it; but to-day it all seems different. We don't seem to\nbe the same to each other, do we, since we felt that water creep up us\nin the dark. However, I shall be very good. I have a lot of work to do,\nand letters to write; and the time may not go so very slowly, or seem so\nvery long, till I see my husband again.\"\n\nOh! it was sweet to look in her eyes, and see the love that shone from\nthem; to hear the delicate cooing music of her voice. My heart seemed\nto fly back to her as I moved away; and every step I took, its strings\nseemed nearer and nearer to the breaking point. When I looked back at\nthe turn of the winding avenue between the fir trees, the last I saw\nthrough my dimming eyes was the wave of her hand and the shining of her\neyes blending into one mass of white light.\n\nIn my rooms at the hotel I found a lot of letters about business, and a\nfew from friends. There was one however which made me think. It was in\nthe writing of Adams, and was as follows, no place or date being given:\n\n\"The people at Crom had better be careful of their servants! There is a\nfootman who often goes out after dark and returns just before morning.\nHe may be in league with enemies. Anyhow, where he gets out and in, and\nhow, others may do the same. _Verb. sap, suff. A._\"\n\nWe had been watched then, and by the Secret Service detectives. I was\nglad that Marjory had promised not to go out till I came. If \"Mac's men\"\nhad seen her, others might also; and the eyes of the others might have\nbeen more penetrating, or their reasoning powers more keen. However, I\nthought it well to send her a word of warning. I copied Adams's letter\ninto mine, with just a word or two of love added. I was amazed to find\nthat altogether it ran to several pages! The gillie of the hotel took it\nover in a pony cart, with instructions to bring me back an answer to\nWhinnyfold. For safety I enclosed it in an envelope to Mrs. Jack. Then,\nwhen I had written a few notes and telegrams, I biked over to my house\non the cliff.\n\nIt was a bleak afternoon and everything seemed grey, sky and sea alike;\neven the rocks, with their crowning of black seaweed swept with the foam\nof lapping waves. Inside the house nothing had of course been stirred;\nbut it seemed so bleak without a fire and with the curtains wide, that I\nmade up a fire of billets and drew the heavy curtains close. As I stood\nin the great bay window and looked out on the fretting sea, and listened\nto the soughing of the rising wind, a great melancholy seemed to steal\nover me, so that I became in a way lost in a mist of gloom. So far as\nI remember, my thoughts were back with the time when I had seen the\nprocession of the dead coming up out of the sea from the Skares beyond,\nand of the fierce looking Spaniard who walked alone in their ranks and\nlooked at me with living eyes. I must have been in a sort of day-dream\nand unconscious of all around me; for, though I had not noticed any one\napproaching, I was startled by a knocking at the door. The house was not\nquite finished; there were electric bells in position, but they had not\nyet been charged, and there was no knocker on the door. The knocking was\nthat of bare knuckles on a panel. I thought of course that it was the\ngillie back from Crom, for I did not expect any one else; so I went at\nonce and opened the door. I recoiled with pure wonder. There, looking\ngrave and dignified, an incarnation of the word 'gentleman' stood Don\nBernardino. His eyes, though now serene, and even kindly, were the eyes\nof the dead man from the sea. Behind him, a few yards off, stood Gormala\nMacNiel with an eager look on her face, half concealed by such a grin\nas made me feel as though I had been trapped, or in some way brought to\nbook. The Spaniard at once spoke:\n\n\"Sir, your pardon! I wish much that I may speak with you in private, and\nsoon. Forgive me if that I trouble you, but it is on a matter of such\nmoment, to me at the least, that I have ventured an intrusion. I learned\nat the hotel that you had hither come; so with the guidance of this good\nlady, who did me much inform, I have found.\" As he spoke of Gormala,\nhe half turned and made a gesture towards her. She had been watching\nour every movement with cat-like eagerness; but when she saw that we\nwere speaking of her, a dark look swept her face, and she moved away\nscowling. The Spaniard went on:\n\n\"What I have to say is secret, and I would be alone with you. May it\nbe that I enter your house; or will you come to mine? I do not mean my\ncastle of Crom, but the house at Ellon which I have taken, until such\ntime as the Senora Jack and that so fair patriot of hers shall wish to\nleave it.\" His manner was so gravely courteous and his bearing so noble,\nthat I found it almost impossible to mistrust him, even when there\nflashed across my memory that dark red-eyed look of his at Crom, which\nrecalled so vividly the dead Spaniard with the living eyes of hate in\nthe procession of ghosts from the Skares. I felt that, in any case,\nit could not do any harm to hear what he had to say: 'Forewarned is\nforearmed' is a good apothegm in dealing with an enemy. I motioned him\ninto the house; he bowed gravely and entered. As I shut the door behind\nus, I caught sight of Gormala with an eager look on her face stealing\nswiftly towards the house. She evidently wanted to be near enough to\nwatch, and to hear if she could.\n\nAs I was opening the door of the drawing-room for Don Bernardino to\nenter, a sudden glimpse of its interior, seen in the dim light through\nthe chinks of the shutters, changed my plans. This was the room\nimprovised as a dressing room for Marjory, and the clothes which she had\nworn in the cave were scattered about the room, hung over the backs of\nchairs to dry. Her toilet matters also were on the table. Altogether\nI felt that to bring the stranger into the room would not only be an\nindelicacy towards my wife, but might in some way give a clue to our\nenemy to guess our secret. With a hasty excuse I closed the door and\nmotioned my guest into the dining room across the hall. I asked him\nto be seated, and then went over to the window and pulled aside the\ncurtains to give us light. I felt that somehow I was safer in the light,\nand that it might enable me to learn more than I could have done in the\ndim twilight of the curtained room.\n\nWhen I turned round, the Spaniard was still standing, facing me. He\nappeared to be studiously keeping himself still; but I could see that\nunder his long black lashes his eyes were roaming round the room.\nUnconsciously to myself, as I know now, my eyes followed his and took in\nthe frightful untidiness of the place. The great hearth was piled with\nextinct ashes; the table was littered with unwashed cups and plates\nand dishes, for we had not cleared up anything after our night in the\ncave. Rugs and pillows were massed untidily on the floor, and the stale\nprovisions on the table made themselves manifest in the close atmosphere\nof the room. I was moving over to throw up the window so as to let in a\nlittle fresh air, when I remembered that Gormala was probably outside\nwith her ears strained close to the wall to hear anything that we might\nsay. So, instead, I apologised for the disorder, saying that I had\ncamped me there for some days whilst working at my book--the excuse I\nhad given at the hotel for my spells of solitary life.\n\nThe Spaniard bowed low with grave courtesy, and implored that I would\nmake no apology. If there were anything not perfect, and for himself he\ndid not see it, such deficiencies were swept away and lost in the tide\nof honour with which I had overwhelmed him in the permission to enter my\nhouse; and much more to the same effect.\n\nThen he came to the serious side of things and began to speak to the\npoint.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XL\n\nTHE REDEMPTION OF A TRUST\n\n\n\"Senor, you may wonder why I am here, and why I would speak with you\nalone and in secret. You have seen me only in a place, which though my\nown by birthright, was dominated by the presence of ladies, who alas! by\ntheir nationality and the stress of war were mine enemies. From you is\nnot such. Our nations are at peace, and there is no personal reason why\nwe should not be of the most friendly. I come to you, Senor, because it\nis borne to me that you are cavalier. You can be secret if you will, and\nyou will recognise the claims of honour and duty, of the highest. The\ncommon people know it not; and for the dear ladies who have their own\nhonour, our duties in such are not a part of their lives--nay! they are\nbeyond and above the life as it is to us. I need not tell you of a\nsecret duty of my family, for it is known to me that all of such is\nalready with you. The secret of the Pope's treasure and of the duty of\nmy House to guard and restore it has been in your mind. Oh yes, this I\nknow\" for he saw I was about to speak. \"Have I not seen in your hands\nthat portion of the book, so long lost!\" Here he stopped and his eyes\nnarrowed; some thought of danger, necessitating caution, had come\nto him. I, too, was silent; I wanted to think. Unless I had utterly\nmisconceived him, he had made an extraordinary admission; one which had\ngiven him away completely. The only occasion on which I had seen him\nwas when he had pointed out to us that the pages which I had found\nbelonged to the book in the library. It is true that we had suggested to\nhim that there was a cipher in the marking of the letters, but he had\nnot acknowledged it. At the time he certainly did not convey the idea to\nus that he believed we had grasped the secret. How then did he know; or\non what assumption did he venture to state that I knew his secret. Here\nwas a difficult point to pass. If I were silent he would take all for\ngranted; in such case I might not learn anything of his purpose. So I\nspoke:\n\n\"Your pardon, Sir, but you presume a knowledge on my part of some secret\nhistory of your family and of a treasure of the Pope; and then account\nfor it that you have seen in my hand the book, a part of which was long\nlost. Am I to take it that because there is, or may be, a secret, any\none who suspects that there is one must know it?\" The steady eyes of the\nSpaniard closed, narrower and narrower still, till the pupils looked\nlike those of a cat in the dark; a narrow slit with a cavern of fire\nwithin. For fully half a minute he continued to look at me steadily, and\nI own that I felt disconcerted. In this matter he had the advantage of\nme. I knew that what he said was true; I did know the secret of the\nburied treasure. He had some way of knowing the extent of my knowledge\nof the matter. He was, so far, all truth; I was prevaricating--and we\nboth knew it! All at once he spoke; as though his mind were made up, and\nhe would speak openly and frankly. The frankness of a Latin was a fell\nand strange affair:\n\n\"Why shall we beat about the bush. I know; you know; and we both know\nthat the other knows. I have read what you have written of the secret\nwhich you have drawn from those marked pages of the law book.\"\n\nAs he spoke the whole detail of his visit to Crom rose before me. At\nthat time he had only seen the printed pages of the cipher; he had not\nseen my transcript which had lain, face down, upon the table. We had\nturned it, on hearing some one coming in.\n\n\"Then you have been to the castle again!\" I said suddenly. My object was\nto disconcert him, but it did not succeed. In his saturnine frankness\nhad been a complete intention, which was now his protection against\nsurprise.\n\n\"Yes!\" he said slowly, and with a smile which showed his teeth, like the\nwolf's to Red Ridinghood.\n\n\"Strange, they did not tell me at Crom,\" I said as though to myself.\n\n\"They did not know!\" he answered. \"When next I visited my own house, it\nwas at night, and by a way not known, save to myself.\" As he spoke, the\ncanine teeth began to show. He knew that what he had to tell was wrong;\nand being determined to brazen it out, the cruelty which lay behind his\nstrength became manifest at once. Somehow at that moment the racial\ninstinct manifested itself. Spain was once the possession of the Moors,\nand the noblest of the old families had some black blood in them. In\nSpain, such is not, as in the West, a taint. The old diabolism whence\nsprung fantee and hoo-doo seemed to gleam out in the grim smile of\nincarnate, rebellious purpose. It was my cue to throw my antagonist off\nhis guard; to attack the composite character in such way that one part\nwould betray the other.\n\n\"Strange!\" I said, as though to myself again. \"To come in secret into\na house occupied by another is amongst civilised people regarded as an\noffence!\"\n\n\"The house is my own!\" he retorted quickly, with a swarthy flush.\n\n\"Strange, again!\" I said. \"When Mrs. Jack rented the castle, there was\nno clause in her agreement of a right to the owner to enter by a secret\nway! On the contrary such rights as the owner reserved were exactly\nspecified.\"\n\n\"A man has a right to enter his own house, when and how he will; and to\nprotect the property which is being filched from him by strangers!\" He\nsaid the last words with such manifest intention of offence that I stood\non guard. Evidently he wanted to anger me, as I had angered him. I\ndetermined that thenceforward I should not let anything which he might\nsay ruffle me. I replied with deliberate exasperation:\n\n\"The law provides remedies for any wrongs done. It does not, that I\nknow of, allow a man to enter secretly into a house that he has let to\nanother. There is an implied contract of peaceful possession, unless\nentry be specified in the agreement.\" He answered disdainfully:\n\n\"My agent had no right to let, without protecting such a right.\"\n\n\"Ah, but he did; and in law we are bound by the acts of our agents.\n'_Facit per alium_' is a maxim of law. And as to filching, let me tell\nyou that all your property at Crom is intact. The pieces of paper that\nyou claimed were left in the book; and the book has remained as you\nyourself placed it on the shelf. I have Mrs. Jack's word that it would\nbe so.\" He was silent; so, as it was necessary that the facts as they\nexisted should be spoken of between us, I went on:\n\n\"Am I to take it that you read the private papers on the table of the\nlibrary during your nocturnal visit? By the way, I suppose it was\nnocturnal.\"\n\n\"It was.\"\n\n\"Then sir,\" I spoke sharply now, \"who has done the filching? We--Miss\nDrake and I--by chance discovered those papers. As a matter of fact they\nwere in an oaken chest which I bought at an auction in the streets of\nPeterhead. We suspected a cipher and worked at it till we laid bare the\nmystery. This is what we have done; we who were even ignorant of your\nname! Now, what have you done? You come as an admitted guest, by\npermission, into a house taken in all good faith by strangers. When\nthere you recognised some papers which had been lost. We restored them\nto you. Honour demanded that you should have been open with us after\nthis. Did you ask if we had discovered the secret of the trust? No! You\nwent away openly; and came back like a thief in the night and filched\nour secret. Yes sir, you did!\" He had raised his hand in indignant\nprotest. \"It was our secret then, not yours. Had you interpreted the\nsecret cipher for yourself, you would have been within your rights; and\nI should have had nothing to say. We offered to let you take the book\nwith you; but you refused. It is evident that you did not know the whole\nsecret of the treasure. That you knew there was a treasure and a secret\nI admit; but the key of it, which we had won through toil, you stole\nfrom us!\"\n\n\"Senor!\" the voice was peremptory and full of all that was best\nand noblest in the man. \"A de Escoban is not wont to hear such an\nallegation; and he who makes such shall in the end have his own death\nto answer for!\" He stopped suddenly, and at his stopping I exulted\nsecretly; though I wished to punish him for his insinuation that Marjory\nhad filched from him, I had no desire to become entangled in a duel. I\nwas determined to go on, however; for I would not, at any hazard, pass\na slight upon my peerless wife. I think that his sudden pause meant\nthought; and thought meant a peaceful solution of things on my own\nlines. Nevertheless, I went on forcing the issue:\n\n\"I rejoice, sir, that you are not accustomed to hear such allegations;\nI trust that you are also not accustomed to deserve them!\" By this time\nhe was calm again, icily calm. It was wonderful with what rapidity, and\nhow widely, the pendulum of his nature swung between pride and passion.\nAll at once he smiled again, the same deadly, dreadful smile which he\nimagined to be the expression of frankness.\n\n\"I see I am punished! 'Twas I that first spoke of stealing. Senor, you\nhave shown me that I was wrong. My pardon to that so good lady who is\nguest of my house; and also to that other patriotic one who so adorns\nit. Now let me say, since to defend myself is thrust upon me, that you,\nwho have, with so much skill made clear the hidden mystery of that law\nbook which I have only lately read, know best of all men how I am bound\nto do all things to protect my trust. I am bound, despite myself, even\nif it were not a duty gladly undertaken for the sake of the dead. It was\nnot I who so undertook; but still I am bound even more than he who did.\nI stand between law and honour, between life and death, helpless. Senor,\nwere you in my place, would you not, too, have acted as I did? Would you\nnot do so, knowing that there was a secret which you could not even try\nto unravel, since long ago that in which it was hidden had been stolen\nor lost. Would you not do so, knowing, too, that some other--in all good\nfaith and innocence let us say--had already made discovery which might\nmock your hopes and nullify the force of that long vigil, to which ten\ngenerations of men, giving up all else, had sacrificed themselves? Would\nnot you, too, have come in secret and made what discovery you could.\nDiscovery of your own, mark you! Would not also that lady so patriotic,\nto whom all things come after that devotion to her country, which so\ngreat she holds?\"\n\nWhilst he was speaking I had been thinking. The pretence of ignorance\nwas all over to both of us; he knew our knowledge of the secret trust,\nand we knew that he knew. The only thing of which he was yet ignorant,\nwas that we had discovered the treasure itself. There was nothing to\nbe gained by disputing points of conjectural morals. Of course he was\nright; had either Marjory or myself considered ourselves bound by such a\nduty as lay so heavy on him we should have done the same. I bowed as I\nanswered;\n\n\"Sir, you are right! Any man who held to such a duty would have done the\nsame.\"\n\n\"Senor,\" he answered quickly, \"I thank you with all my heart!\" Poor\nfellow, at that moment I pitied him. The sudden flash of joy that leaped\nto his face showed by reaction in what a hell he must have of late\nbeen living. This momentary episode seemed to have wiped away all his\nbitterness; it was in quite a different way that he spoke again:\n\n\"And now, Senor, since your engaging frankness has made my heart so\nglad, may I ask further of your kindness. Believe me that it is not of\nmy own will, but from an unbending sense of duty that I do and may have\nto do such things; my life till lately has been otherwise, oh! so much\nso! You have the feelings of honour yourself; like me you are also man\nof the world, and as such we can sacrifice all things save honour. Is\nthere no way in which you can aid me to fulfill my trust; and let there\nbe peace between us?\" He looked at me anxiously; I said:\n\n\"I fear I hardly understand?\" With manifest embarrassment he went on;\n\n\"You will forgive me if I err again; but this time I must make myself\nclear. It is manifest to me that in these days of science nothing can\nlong remain hidden, when once a clue has been found. You already know\nso much that I am placed almost as though the treasure has already\nbeen found. Thereafter where am I; what am I? One who has failed in\nhis trust. Who has allowed another to step in; and so dishonour him! A\nmoment, Senor, and I am done,\" for he saw that I was about to speak. \"It\nis not the treasure itself that I value, but the trust. If I could make\nit safe by the sacrifice of all my possessions I would gladly do so.\nSenor, you are still free. You have but to abandon your quest. It is not\nto you a duty; and therefore you sacrifice naught of honour should you\nabandon it. Here I pledge to you--and, oh Senor, I pray have patience\nthat you take no affront that I do so--that in such case I shall give to\nyou all that I have. Give it gladly! So, I may redeem the trust of my\nHouse; and go out into the wide world, though it may be as a beggar, yet\nfree--free! Oh! pause, Senor, and think. I am rich in the world's goods.\nMy ancestors were of vast wealth; even at that time when the great\nBernardino did give his ship to his king. And for three centuries all\nhave been prudent; and all their possessions have grown. There are vast\nlands of corn, great forests, many castles, whole ranges of mountains\nas yet untouched for their varied treasures which are vast. There are\nseaports and villages; and in all, the dwellers are happy and content. I\nam the last of my race. There is none to inherit; so I am free to pledge\nmyself.\" He did not bow or bend; there was no persistence of request in\nhis voice, or tone, or manner. In all there was no feeling of a bargain.\nIt was an offer, based on the fulfillment of his own desires; given in\nsuch a lordly way that there could be no offence in it. He recognised so\nthoroughly the strength of my own position, that the base side of barter\nbecame obliterated; it was an exchange of goods between gentlemen. Such,\nat least, I recognised was his intellectual position; my own remained\nthe same. How could I, or any man, take advantage of such an offer.\nAfter thinking a few seconds I said to him:\n\n\"Sir, you have honoured me by grouping us as men of honour. What would\nyou do in my place?\" His eye brightened, and his breath came more\nquickly as he replied:\n\n\"Were it my case, I should say: 'Senor, your duty is one of honour; mine\nis one of gain. There can be no comparisons. Fulfill your debt to your\nforefathers! Redeem the pledge that they have made in your name!\nDiscover your treasure; and be free!'\" There was infinite pride in his\nvoice and manner; I think he really meant what he said. I went on with\nmy questioning:\n\n\"And what about the taking of your estate as a reward of forbearance?\"\n\nHe shrugged his shoulders: \"For that,\" he said, \"it matters not.\"\n\n\"Ah, for you to give you mean?\" He nodded.\n\n\"But what for me to take? Would you do so in my place?\" He was\nmanifestly in a dilemma. I could see something of the working of\nhis mind in his face. If he said he would himself take it, he would\nmanifestly lower himself in his own eyes; and to such pride as his, his\nown self-respect was more than the respect of others, in proportion to\nhis self-value. If he said he would not, then he might peril his chance\nof getting what he desired. The temptation was a cruel one; with all\nmy heart I honoured him for his answer, given with the fullness of his\nmighty pride:\n\n\"Senor, I can die; I cannot stoop! But what avails my own idea? The\nanswer is not for me! I have offered all I have. I will in addition\npledge myself to hold my life at your service when this great trust is\nrelieved. To this my honour is guardian; you need not fear it shall be\nredeemed! Now Senor, you have my answer! To redeem the trust of my sires\nI give all I have in the world, except my honour! The answer rests with\nyou!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLI\n\nTREASURE TROVE\n\n\nThere was no doubt that the Spaniard's devotion to his cause placed me\nin a considerable difficulty. I could not disguise from myself that he\nput forward a very strong claim for the consideration of one gentleman\nby another. It was only on hurriedly thinking the matter over that the\nweakness of his cause was apparent. Had the whole affair been a private\nor personal one; had the treasure belonged to his ancestors, I should\nhave found it in my own heart a very difficult matter to gainsay him,\nand be subsequently at ease with myself. I remembered, however, that\nthe matter was a public one. The treasure was collected by enemies of\nEngland for the purpose of destroying England's liberty, and so the\nliberty of the whole human race for which it made. It was sent in charge\nof a personal enemy of the country in a ship of war, one of many built\nfor the purpose of invading and conquering England. In time of national\nstress, when the guns were actually thundering along our coast from the\nThames to the Tyne, the treasure had been hidden so as to preserve it\nfor future use in its destined way. Though centuries had passed, it was\nstill held in mind; and the very men who had guarded it were, whilst\nprofessing to be Britons, secret enemies of the country, and devoted to\nher ultimate undoing. Beyond this again, there was another reason for\nnot giving it up which appealed to me more strongly than the claim of\nmy own natural duty, because it came to me through Marjory. Though Spain\nwas at peace with my country, it was at war with hers; the treasure\ncollected to harm England might--nay, would--be used to harm America.\nSpain was impoverished to the last degree. Her treasuries were empty,\nher unpaid soldiers clamourous for their arrears. Owing to want at home,\nthere was in places something like anarchy; abroad there was such lack\nof all things, ships, men, stores, cannon, ammunition, that the evil\nof want came across the seas to the statesmen of the Quirinal with\nheart-breaking persistence. America, unprepared for war at first, was\nday by day becoming better equipped. The panic had abated which had set\nin on the seaboard towns from Maine to California, when each found\nitself at the mercy of a Spanish fleet sweeping the seas, no man knew\nwhere. Now if ever, money would be of value to impoverished Spain. This\ngreat treasure, piled up by the Latin for the conquering of the\nAnglo-Saxon, and rescued from its burial of three centuries, would come\nin the nick of time to fulfill its racial mission; though that mission\nmight be against a new branch of the ancient foe of Spain, whose roots\nonly had been laid when the great Armada swept out in all its pride and\nglory on its conquering essay. I needed no angel to tell me what would\nbe Marjory's answer, were such a proposition made to her. I could see\nin my mind's eye the uprearing of her tall figure in all its pride and\nbeauty, the flashing of her eyes with that light of patriotic fire which\nI knew so well, the set of her mouth, the widening of her nostril, the\nwrinkling of her ivory forehead as the brows were raised in scorn----\n\n\"Sir,\" said I with what dignity I had, \"the matter is not for you or me\nto decide. Not for us both! This is an affair of two nations, or rather\nof three: The Papacy, the Spaniard, the Briton. Nay, it touches another\nalso, for the lady who shares the secret with me represents the country\nwith which your nation is at war!\" The Spaniard was manifestly baffled;\nthe red, hellish light shone in his eyes again. His anger found\nexpression in a sneer:\n\n\"Ah! so I suppose you do not propose to deal with the treasure, when\nfound, as a private matter; but shall hand it over to your government\nto deal with!\" The best answer to his scorn was complacency; so I said\nquietly:\n\n\"There again we are in a difficulty. You see, my dear fellow, no one\nexactly knows how we stand in this matter. The law of Treasure Trove,\nas we call it in this country, is in a most chaotic state. I have been\nlooking it up since I undertook this quest; and I am rather surprised\nthat in all the years that have elapsed since our practical law-making\nbegan, nothing has been done to put such matters on an exact basis. The\nlaw, such as it is, seems to rest on Royal Prerogative; but what the\nbase of that prerogative is, no one seems exactly to know. And besides,\nin the various constitutional changes, and the customs of different\ndynasties, there are, or certainly there may be, barriers to the\nassertion of any Crown right--certainly to the fulfillment of such!\" He\nseemed staggered. He had manifestly never regarded the matter as other\nthan the recovery of property entrusted to him through his ancestors. I\ntook advantage of his mental disturbance; and as I myself wanted time to\nthink, so that I might fix on some course of action which would suit\nMarjory's wishes as well as my own, I began to tell him the impression\nleft on my mind by such study of the subject of Treasure Trove as I had\nbeen able to achieve. I quoted now and again from notes made in my\npocket book.\n\n\"The Scotch law is much the same as the English; and as we are in\nScotland, we are of course governed by the former. The great point of\ndifference, seen with the eyes of a finder, is that in Scotland the\nfraudulent concealment of Treasure Trove is not a criminal offence, as\nit is in England. Thus, from my point of view, I have nothing to fear\nas to results; for though by the General Police Act the finder is bound\nto report the find to the Chief Constable, the statute only applies to\nthings found on roads or in public places. So far as this treasure is\nconcerned, it may turn out that it can, in a sense, be no treasure trove\nat all.\"--\n\n\"According to Blackstone, treasure trove is where any money or coin,\ngold, silver, plate or bullion is found hidden _in_ the earth or other\nprivate place, the owner thereof being unknown. If found _upon_ the\nearth, or in the sea, it belongs, not to the Crown, but to the finder,\nif no owner appears. It is the hiding, not the abandoning, which gives\nthe Crown the property.\"--\n\n\"Coin or bullion found at the bottom of a lake or in the bed of a river\nis not treasure trove. It is not hidden in the earth.\"--\n\n\"The right of the Crown is ... limited to gold or silver, bullion or\ncoin. It extends to nothing else.\"...\n\nWhen I had got thus far the Spaniard interrupted me:\n\n\"But sir, in all these that you say, the rights of the owner seem to be\nrecognised even in your law.\"\n\n\"Ah, but there comes in again a fresh difficulty; or rather a fresh\nseries of difficulties, beginning with what is, in the eye of the\nlaw, the 'owner.' Let us for a moment take your case. You claim this\ntreasure--if it can be found--as held by you for the original possessor.\nThe original possessor was, I take it, the Pope, who sent it with the\nArmada, to be used for the conversion or subduing of England. We will\ntake the purpose later, but in the meantime we are agreed that the\noriginal owner was Pope Sixtus V. Now, the Popedom is an office, and on\nthe death of one incumbent his successor takes over all his rights and\npowers and privileges whatever they may be. Thus, the Pope of to-day\nstands in exactly the same position as did Pope Sixtus V, when he sent\nthrough King Philip, and in trust of Bernardino de Escoban the aforesaid\ntreasure.\" I felt that the words 'aforesaid treasure' sounded very\nlegal; it helped to consolidate even my own ideas as I went along. \"So,\ntoo, you as the representative of your own family, are in the same\nposition of original trustee as was your great ancestor of which this\nrecord takes cognisance.\" This too was convincingly legal in sound. \"I\ndo not think that British law would recognise your position, or that\nof your predecessors in the trust, in the same way as it would the\ncontinuation of the ownership, if any, on the part of the succession of\nthe Popes. However, for the sake of the argument, let us take it they\nwould be of equal force. If this be so, the claim of ownership and\nguardianship would be complete.\" As I paused, the Spaniard who had been\nlistening to me with pent up breath, breathed more freely. With a\ngraceful movement, which was almost a bow, he said:\n\n\"If so that you recognise the continued ownership, and if you speak\nas the exponent of the British law, wherein then is the difficulty of\nownership at all; should it be that the treasure may be found?\" Here was\nthe real difficulty of both my own argument and Don Bernardino's. For\nmy own part, I had not the faintest idea of what the law might be; but\nI could see easily enough that great issues might be raised for the\nBritish side against the Spanish. As I had to 'bluff' my opponent to a\ncertain extent, I added the impressions of personal conviction to my\nmanner as I answered:\n\n\"Have you considered what you, or rather your predecessors in title and\ntrust, have done to forfeit any rights which you may have had?\" He paled\nand was visibly staggered; it was evident that this view of the question\nhad not entered his mind. The mere suggestion of the matter now opened\nup for him grave possibilities. His lips grew dry, and it was with a\nvoice hoarser than hitherto that, after a pause, he said:\n\n\"Go on!\"\n\n\"This treasure was sent, in time of war, by the enemies of England, for\nthe purpose of her undoing--that is her undoing from the point of view\nof the established government of the time. It was in itself an act\nof war. The very documents that could, or can, prove the original\nownership, would serve to prove the hostile intent of such owners in\nsending it. Remember, that it came in a warship, one of the great Armada\nbuilt and brought together to attack this country. The owner of the\ntreasure, the Pope, gave it in trust for the _cestui que trust_, the\nKing of Spain to your ancestor Bernardino de Escoban, as hereditary\ntrustee. Your ancestor himself had the battleship _San Cristobal_ built\nat his own cost for the King's service in the war against England. You\nsee, they were all--the individual as well as the nation--hostile to\nEngland; and the intention of evil towards that country, what British\nlaw calls 'malice prepense' or the '_mens rea_' was manifest in all!\"\nThe Spaniard watched me intently; I could see by the darkening of his\nswarthy face and the agonised contraction of his brows that the argument\nwas striking home to his very heart. The man was so distressed that,\nenemy as I felt him to be, it was with a pang that I went on:\n\n\"It remains to be seen what view the British law would take of your\naction, or what is the same, that of your predecessor in the trust, in\nhiding the treasure in the domains of Britain. As a foreigner you would\nnot have, I take it, a right in any case. And certainly, as a foreigner\nin arms against this country, you would have--could have--no right in\neither domestic or international law. The right was forfeit on landing\nfrom your warship in time of war on British shores!\"\n\nThere was a long pause. Now that I came to piece out into an argument\nthe scattered fragments of such legal matters as I had been able to\nlearn, and my own ideas on the subject, the resulting argument was\nstronger than I had at first imagined. A whole host of collateral\nmatters also cropped up. As I was expounding the law, as I saw it, the\nsubject took me away with it:\n\n\"This question would then naturally arise: if the forfeiture of the\nrights of the original owner would confer a right upon the Crown of\nBritain, standing as it does in such a matter as the 'remainder man.'\nAlso whether the forfeited treasure having been hidden, being what the\nlaw calls '_bona vacantia_,' can be acquired by the finder, subject to\nthe law relating to the Royal prerogative. In both the above cases there\nwould arise points of law. In either, for instance, the nature of the\ntreasure might limit the Crown claim as over against an individual\nclaiming rights as finder.\"\n\n\"How so?\" asked Don Bernardino. He was recovering his _sang froid_, and\nmanifestly was wishful to reassert himself.\n\n\"According to the statement of Don Bernardino, which would assuredly be\nadduced in evidence on either side, the treasure was, or is, of various\nclasses; coined money, bullion, gems and jewel work. By one of the\nextracts which I have read you, the Crown prerogative only applies to\nprecious metals or bullion. Gems or jewellery are therefore necessarily\nexcluded; for it could not, I think, be claimed that such baubles were\ncontraband of war.\"\n\n\"Again, the place of hiding may make a bar to Crown claim as treasure\ntrove. According to the cipher narrative the place of hiding was a sea\ncave. This could not be either 'on' the ground, which would give title\nto the finder; or 'in' the ground which would give Crown claim. But\nbeyond this again, there might arise the question as to whether the\ntreasure should in any way come into the purview of the law at all. You\nwill remember, in one of my excerpts Blackstone excepts the sea from the\nconditions of treasure trove. It might have to be fought out in the Law\nCourts, right up to the House of Lords which is our final Court of\nAppeal, whether the definition of 'sea' would include a cave into which\nthe tide ran.\" Here I stopped; my argument was exhausted of present\npossibilities. The Spaniard's thought now found a voice:\n\n\"But still ownership might be proved. Our nations have been at peace\never since that unhappy time of the Invincible Armada. Nay more, have\nnot the nations fought side by side in the Peninsula! Besides, at no\ntime has there been war between England and the Pope, even when his\npriests were proscribed and hunted, and imprisoned when captured.\nThe friendship of these countries would surely give a base for the\nfavourable consideration of an international claim. Even if there may\nhave been a constructive forfeiture, such was never actually exacted;\nEngland might, in her wisdom, yield the point to a friendly nation, when\nthree hundred years had elapsed.\" Here another idea struck me.\n\n\"Of course\" I said \"such might be so. England is rich and need not\nenforce her right to a treasure, however acquired. But let me remind you\nthat lawyers are very tenacious of points of law, and this would have\nto be decided by lawyers who are the servants of the state and the\nadvisers of the governments. Such would, no doubt, be guided by existing\nprinciples of law, even if the specific case were not on all fours with\nprecedents. I learn that in India, which is governed by laws made by\nBritons and consonant with the scheme of British law, there is actually\nan act in existence which governs Treasure Trove. By this, the\nmagisterial decision can be held over to allow the making of a claim of\nprevious ownership within a hundred years. So you see that by analogy\nyour claim of three hundred years of peace would put you clean out of\ncourt.\" We both remained silent. Then the Spaniard, with a long sigh,\nrose up and said courteously:\n\n\"I thank you Senor, for the audience which you have given to me. As\nthere is to be no _rapprochement_ to us, what I can say may not avail.\nI must now take my own course. I am sad; for what that course may have\nto be, I know not. I would have given my fortune and my life to have\nacquitted me honourably of the trust imposed on me. But such happiness\nmay not alas! be mine. Senor\" this he said very sternly \"I trust that\nyou will always remember that I tried all ways that I know of, of peace\nand honour, to fulfill my duty. Should I have to take means other\nto discharge my duty, even to the point of life and death, you will\nunderstand that I have no alternative.\"\n\n\"Would you take life?\" I said impulsively, half incredulous.\n\n\"I would not scruple regarding my own life; why should I, regarding that\nof another?\" he said simply, then he went on:\n\n\"But oh! Senor, it is not the taking of life, my own or another's, which\nI dread. It is that I may have to walk in devious ways, where honour is\nnot; have I not already tasted of its bitterness! Understand me that\nthis duty of guardianship of the trust is not of my choosing. It was set\nto me and mine by other and greater powers than ourselves, by the\nVicegerent of God Himself; and what is ordained by him I shall do in all\nways that are demanded of me.\"\n\nI was sorry for him, very sorry; but his words made a new fear. Hitherto\nI had been dealing with a gentleman, and there is much protection in\nthis thought to any opponent. Now, however, he calmly announced that he\nwould act without scruple. I was in future to dread, not fair fighting\nalone, but crooked ways and base acts. So I spoke out:\n\n\"Am I not then to look on you as a man of honour?\" His face darkened\ndangerously; but all its haughty pride was obliterated by a look of\ndespair and grief as he said sadly:\n\n\"Alas I know not. I am in the hands of God! He may deal mercifully with\nme, and allow me to pass to my grave not dishonoured; but for myself my\npath has been set in ways that may lead I know not whither.\"\n\nSomehow his words made me feel like a cad. I didn't mind fighting a man\nfair; or indeed fighting him anyway, so long as we understood the matter\nfrom the first. But this was against the grain. The man had shown\nhimself willing to give up everything he had, so as to fulfill his trust\nand be free; and for me now to have a part in forcing him into ways of\ndishonour seemed too bad. It didn't seem altogether fair to me either. I\nhad always tried to act honourably and mercifully, so that to have my\nown hand forced to acquiesce in the downfall of another man was in its\nway hard lines on me too. Truly, the ways of wealth are full of thorns;\nand when war and politics and intrigue are joined in the chase for\ngold, there is much suffering for all who are so unhappy as to be drawn\nwithin the spell. I was weakening in my resolve regarding the treasure,\nand would, I am sure, in a moment of impulse have made some rash proffer\nto the Spaniard; when once more there came back to me the purpose of the\ntreasure, and what Marjory might think if I allowed it to go back where\nit might be used against her country. Whatever I might do, there was no\nhope of compromise on the part of Don Bernardino. His one purpose, blind\nand set, was to fulfill the obligation set by his forefather and to\nrestore the treasure to Spain, by whom it might or might not be restored\nto the Pope. The intensity of my thought had concentrated my interests\nto such an extent that I did not consciously notice what was going on\naround me. Only in a sort of dim way did I know that the Spaniard's eyes\nwere roving round the room; seeking, in the blind agony of the despair\nwhich was upon his soul for a clue or opening somewhere.\n\nAll at once I became broad awake to the situation of things which had\nhappened in those few seconds. He was gazing with eyes of amazement on\nthe heap of metal caskets, dimmed with three centuries of sea water,\nwhich were piled on the side table amongst the scattered heaps of odds\nand ends of various kinds, made manifest by some trick of light. Then\nthere came a light into his eyes as he raised his hand and pointed\nsaying:\n\n\"So the treasure has been found!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLII\n\nA STRUGGLE\n\n\nI think that at first sheer amazement had controlled the Spaniard's\nthoughts. But whatever the cause of the control was, it soon passed\naway; then the whole fiery nature of the man seemed to sweep from him\nlike a torrent:\n\n\"And so all the learned arguments with which you have overwhelmed me,\nwere but a cloak to cover your possession of the treasure which it was\ngiven to me and mine to guard. I might have guessed, that without the\ncertainty of possession you would not have been so obdurate to my offer,\ngiven in all sincerity as it was. From other things, too, I might have\nknown! That woman, so old, who watches you with eyes that see more than\nis to see, and who have reason of her own to mistrust you, she telled\nto me that nightly she has heard you dig in the rock as though you make\ngrave. Take care it is not so! I am guardian of that treasure; and I am\ndesperate! Already have I told you that all things are to me, all ways\nto fulfill the trust of my fathers. We are here alone! I am armed; and\nalready my life is forfeit to this course. Yield yourself, then, to me!\"\n\nLike a flash of light he had drawn a dagger from his breast; and with an\nupward sweep of his hand held it poised, either to strike or throw.\nBut already I had taken warning from his eyes. Ever since danger had\nthreatened Marjory, I had carried my revolver with me; even at night it\nrested under my pillow. The practice which Marjory and I had often had,\ntill she had taught me the old trick which her father had taught her of\ngetting \"the drop\" on an adversary, stood me now in good stead. Whilst\nhe had been drawing his dagger, I had already covered him; he finished\nthe words of his command straight into the muzzle of my six-shooter.\nI said as quietly as I could, for it was with a mighty effort I kept\napproximately calm under stress of such a sudden attack:\n\n\"Drop that dagger! Quick; or I shall shoot it from your hands!\" He\nrecognised his helplessness in the matter. With a despairing sigh he\nopened his fingers; the dagger fell jingling to the floor. I went on:\n\n\"Now hold up your hands, well above your head! Move back to the wall!\"\nHe did so, and stood facing me with a disdainful smile. I stooped, and\nwith my right hand picked up the dagger, still keeping him covered with\nmy left. I put the weapon on the far side of the table, and approached\nhim. He did not move, but I could see that he was sizing me up. This\ngave me no anxiety, for I knew my own strength; and I had also a shrewd\nidea that if he had any other arm about him he would not be calculating\nhis chances for a physical struggle. Cautioning him that his life\ndepended on his stillness, for I still held my revolver to his breast, I\npassed my hand lightly over him; he had manifestly no other weapon. The\nonly sign of one was the sheath of his dagger; this I took from him.\nI placed the dagger in it and put it in my own pocket; then I drew a\nchair to the middle of the room and motioned him to sit down. He obeyed\nsullenly. Having by this time regained something of my serenity of mind,\nI spoke:\n\n\"Your pardon, Sir, for the indignity to which I have been obliged to\nsubmit you; but I am sure you will remember that it was not I who began\nthe question of force. When you thought it right to draw arms upon me in\nmy own house, you made it necessary that I should protect myself. Now,\nlet me say something in answer to your charge against me. The finding of\nthe treasure has nothing whatever to do with my theory of action;\nI should hold my present view just as strongly had we not made the\ndiscovery. Indeed, I may say that since we have had actual possession of\nthe treasure, it seems not nearly so desirable as it had been. So far as\nI am concerned, I don't care a straw whether I have ultimate possession\nof it or not; but I am so fixed up that if I waive my rights--that is if\nI have any to waive--that I may aid in doing a repugnant thing to a very\ndear friend. That I shall not do. I shall oppose its doing by any means\nin my power!\" The Spaniard saw a chance, and spoke:\n\n\"But if I undertake----\" I cut him short:\n\n\"Sir, in this matter you are not in a position to undertake. By your own\nshowing, you are simply bound to fulfill your trust and to restore the\ntreasure to the King, who will restore it to the Pope; or to restore it\nto the Pope direct.\" He answered quickly:\n\n\"But I can stipulate----\" again I interrupted him for this was a useless\nroad to travel;\n\n\"How can you stipulate? You would, or might, be told to simply fulfill\nthe duty that had been undertaken for you. Did you refuse, from whatever\nmotive, no matter how justly founded, on ground of right or honour, you\nwould not be holding to the simple terms of your trust. No! sir. This is\nno private affair to be settled by you or me, or by us both together. It\nbelongs to politics! and international politics at that. The Government\nof Spain is desperately in want of money. How do you know to what shift,\nor to what specious argument it will condescend in its straits. I have\nno doubt that, should anything be done contrary to your idea of fair\nplay, you would be grievously pained; but that is not to the point. Your\nGovernment would not take thought for any wish of yours, any more than\nfor aught of mine. Your King is a minor; his regent is a woman, and his\ncouncillors and governors are all men chosen to do what they can to save\ntheir country. Sir, but a few minutes ago you professed it your duty to\ntake any step, even to crime and dishonour, to carry out your duty.\nIndeed, you drew a weapon upon me, a presumably unarmed man, in my own\nhouse in which you are a self-invited guest. Suppose some of the\nGovernment of Spain hold ideas of their duty, equally strong and equally\nunscrupulous; who then is to answer for what they do. Why, in such case,\nthey would undertake anything, until they had got possession of the\ntreasure; and would then act entirely upon what they would call their\n'better judgment.'\" His native pride awoke in an instant for he said\nhotly:\n\n\"I would have you know, Senor, and remember always when you talk with a\nSpaniard, that our statesmen are not criminals, but men of honour.\" I\nbowed instinctively as I answered him:\n\n\"Sir, I have no doubt whatever, and I speak in all sincerity, that you\nyourself are, under normal circumstances, a man of the highest honour.\nYour self-sacrificing offer has shewn me that; and I have added to that\nknowledge by seeing the pain you have suffered at even the thought of\ndishonour.\" Here he bowed low, and there was a look of gratitude in his\neyes which touched me to the quick. \"And yet even you have openly told\nme that all your belief in honour, all your life-long adherence to its\nbehests, will not keep you from fulfilling a duty should these things\nclash. Nay more, you have already done things which I take it are at\nvariance with your principles. How then can you, or I, believe that\nother men, of less lofty lineage and less delicate sense of honour,\nwill forego an advantage for their country in distress, yielding to a\ntheoretical point of right or wrong. No sir\" I went on pitilessly, for I\nfelt that it would be a kindness to him to shut absolutely this door of\nhope, \"We must take no step which will place in the hands of others the\nguardianship of that treasure, of which you have hitherto conceived\nyourself trustee, and of which I now believe myself to be the owner.\"\nFor fully several minutes we faced each other in silence. His face grew\nmore and more fixed and stern; at last he stood up with such a look of\nresolution that instinctively my fingers tightened round the butt of my\nrevolver. I thought that he might be about to throw himself upon me, and\nattempt even at such odds as were against him, a struggle for present\nmastery. Then, without moving from his place, he spoke:\n\n\"When I have done all I can to fulfill my trust in its completeness,\nand have failed, I shall ask the government of my country to make\nrepresentation to her friend England of a friendly claim, so that we may\nget even a part of the treasure; and then I will devote myself to the\navenging of my honour on those who have foiled me in my duty!\" This was\na sort of speech which braced me up again. It was a promise of war, man\nto man, and I could understand it better than the subtleties which now\nenmeshed us. I put my pistol back in my pocket, and bowed to my opponent\nas I answered:\n\n\"And when that time comes, Sir, you will find me at your service; how\nyou will; where you will; and when you will. In the meantime, when first\nyou place the matter on the international plane, I shall take care that\nthe American government, in which dear friends of mine are interested,\nshall make friendly demand of her friend, England, that she shall take\nno step with regard to this particular treasure--if indeed it be then in\nher possession--which may be used to the detriment of the trans-Atlantic\npower. Thus you see, sir, that time must in any case elapse before a\nfinal settlement. Nothing can be done till the close of the present war,\nwhen I take it that immediate need of the sinews of war shall have\nceased to exist. Be very careful, then, how you take any steps to bring\nupon the scene other powers than ourselves; powers vastly more strong,\nand vastly less scrupulous--perhaps.\" He answered nothing, but looked at\nme a long time in silent cold disdain. Then he said quietly:\n\n\"Have I your permission, Senor, to depart?\" I bowed, and brought him\nto the door. When outside he turned, and, lifting his hat high in an\nold-fashioned, stately way, bowed. He passed up the laneway towards\nWhinnyfold, without once glancing back.\n\nAs I stood looking at him, I saw in the dusk Gormala's head now and\nagain showing above the low green bank which guarded the edge of the\ncliff. She was bent double, and was in secret following the Spaniard.\n\nI went back to the house to think over matters. Altogether, we were\ngetting so complicated that there did not seem any straight road to\ntake. In the back of my mind I had a firm idea that the best thing\nI could do would be to hand over the treasure to the custody of the\npolice; inform the Sheriff; and get my solicitor to enter a formal claim\nof ownership, wherever the claim should be made. Then I should get\nMarjory to come upon our honeymoon. I could see that her mind was\nalmost, if not quite, made up to accept this step; and for a while I\nlost myself in a day dream.\n\nI came back to the reality of things by dimly and gradually realising\nthat it had grown dark. So I made preparation for the night, bearing in\nmind that I had a vast treasure in my possession, and that a desperate\nman who claimed to represent its ownership was aware that I had it in\nthe house. It was not till I had seen to the fastenings of every window\nand door, that I began to prepare a meal.\n\nBy this time I was exceedingly hungry; when I had eaten I seated myself\nbefore a rousing fire of pine logs, lit my pipe, and began to think.\nWithout, the wind was rising. I could hear it whistle along the roof,\nand now and again it roared and boomed down the chimney; the leaping\nfire seemed to answer its call. I could not think definitely; my\nthoughts kept whirling in a circle from the Spaniard to the treasure,\nfrom the treasure to Gormala, from Gormala to Marjory, and from Marjory\nback to the Spaniard again. Every time the cycle became complete and my\nthoughts came back to Marjory, my rapture as I thought of her and of\nour future, became clouded by a vague uneasiness. It was out of this\nthat the thought of Don Bernardino came to commence the next round of\nthought. In all my mental wanderings he became a dominant character;\nhis pride, his sense of duty which subordinated even honour, his\ndesperation, his grief, all seemed to be with me and around me. Now and\nagain I trembled, when I thought that such self-sacrificing forces might\nbe turned against Marjory.\n\nLittle by little, despite all my anxiety, stole over me the disposition\nof sleep. I was indeed almost worn out. The events of the past few days\nhad crowded together so quickly that I had had no time for pause. Even\nthe long sleep which had crowned the vigil in the water cave had not\nenabled me to lay in, so to speak, a provision of sleep; it had been the\npayment of a debt to nature rather than the putting by of capital. I\nhad the consoling thought that Marjory had promised me she would not\nleave Crom Castle till I came. Safe in this thought I rolled myself in\nrugs--choosing those that she had used--and fell asleep.\n\nI think that even in sleep I did not lose the sense of my surroundings,\nfor in dreams my thoughts ran in their waking channel. Here again, all\nthe disturbing elements of my life of late became jumbled together; and\na sort of anxiety regarding something unknown seemed to brood over me.\nSo far as I remember, I slept fitfully; waking often in a sort of agony\nof indefinite apprehension. A couple of times I made up the fire which\nwas falling low, for there was a sort of companionship in it. Without,\nthe wind howled more loudly, and each time as I sank back to rest I\npulled the rugs more closely around me.\n\nOnce, I started broad awake. I thought I heard a cry, and naturally, in\nmy present frame of mind, my thoughts flew to Marjory in some danger;\nshe was calling me. Whatever the cause was, it reached my brain through\na thick veil of sleep; my body answered, and before I had time to think\nof why or wherefore, I was standing on the floor broad awake, alert and\npanting. Again there came a sharp cry outside, which threw me in an\ninstant into a cold sweat. Marjory was in danger and was calling me!\nInstinctively I ran to the window, and pulling open the shutters, threw\nup the sash. All was dark outside, with just that cold line on the far\nEastern horizon which told of coming dawn. The wind had risen high, and\nswept past me into the room, rustling papers and making the flames\ndance. Every now and again a bird swept by me on the wings of the\nwind, screaming as it flew; for the house was so close to the sea that\nthe birds took no note of it as they would ordinarily do of a human\nhabitation. One of them came so close that its scream seemed to sound\nloudly in my ears; it was doubtless just such a cry as this which had\ntorn me from my sleep. For a while I hesitated whether I should go right\naway to Crom; but second thoughts prevailed. I could not get into the\nhouse at such an hour, without creating alarm and causing comment. So I\nwent back to the chimney corner, and, piling on fresh logs and snuggling\ninto my nest of rugs, soon found sleep again descending on me. The\nserenity of thought which comes with the day was using its force....\n\nThis time I woke more slowly. The knocking was continuous and\nimperative; but it was not a terrifying sound. We are all more or less\nused to such sounds. I listened; and gradually consciousness of my\nsurroundings came back to me. The knocking was certainly persistent....\nI put on my shoes and went to the door.\n\nOutside was Mrs. Jack, looking troubled and hot in spite of the cold of\nthe wind which seemed to sing around the house. As I opened the door,\nshe slipped past me and closed it behind her. Her first words made my\nheart sink, and my blood run cold with vague terror:\n\n\"Is Marjory here?\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIII\n\nTHE HONOUR OF A SPANIARD\n\n\nMrs. Jack saw the answer in my eyes before speech came, and staggered\nback against the wall.\n\n\"No,\" I said \"Why do you ask?\"\n\n\"She is not here! Then there is something wrong; she was not in her room\nthis morning!\"\n\nThis morning! The words set my thoughts working. I looked at my watch;\nit was past ten o'clock. In a dazed kind of way I heard Mrs. Jack go on.\n\n\"I did not say a word to any of the servants at first, for I didn't want\nto set them talking. I went all over the house myself. Her bed had not\nbeen slept in; I pulled the clothes off it and threw them on again\nroughly so that the maid might not suspect. Then I asked quietly if any\nof the maids had seen her; but none had. So I said as quietly as I could\nthat she must have gone out for an early walk; and I took my breakfast.\nThen I had the cart got ready, and drove over here myself. What can it\nbe? She told me last night that she was not going out until you came;\nand she is always so exact when she says a thing, that there must be\nsomething wrong. Come back with me at once! I am so anxious that I don't\nknow what to do.\"\n\nTwo minutes sufficed for my toilet; then shutting the door behind us,\nwe got into the cart and drove to Crom. At the first and at the last we\nwent quietly, so as not to arouse attention by our speed; but in the\nmiddle space we flew. During the journey Mrs. Jack had told me that\nlast night she had gone to bed as usual, leaving in the drawing room\nMarjory, who had told her that she was going presently into the library\nto write as she had a lot of letters to get through, and that no one was\nto wait up for her. This was her usual habit when she sat late; it\ntherefore excited no extra attention. Mrs. Jack who was an early riser,\nhad been dressed for an hour before she went to Marjory's room. In\nthe course of her enquiries amongst the servants, one of them, whose\nbusiness it was to open the hall door, told her that she had found it\nlocked and chained as usual.\n\nWithin the house at Crom we found all quiet. I went at once into the\nlibrary, as that was presumably the last place where Marjory had been.\nAs we went, I asked Mrs. Jack if any letters had been left out to post.\nShe said no! that the usual habit was to put such in the box on the hall\ntable, but she had herself, looked, when she came down to put in a\nletter for America. I went over at once to the table near the fire where\nMarjory usually sat at night. There were plenty of writing materials\nand blank paper and envelopes; but not a sign of a letter or anything\nwritten. I looked all round the room but could see nothing to attract\nmy attention. Once more I asked Mrs. Jack what Marjory had said to her\nabout her intention of not leaving the castle till I had come. With some\nhesitation at first, as though she were fearful of breaking confidence,\nbut afterwards more freely as if glad to be able to speak, she told me\nall:\n\n\"The dear child took to heart what I said yesterday about her living\nwith her husband. After you had gone she came to me and laid her head on\nmy breast, as she used to do as a little child, and began to cry; and\ntold me that I had been very good to her. The darling! And that her mind\nwas made up. She realised now her duty to her husband; and that as he\nwished her to stay in the house, nothing in the world would induce her\nto leave it till he came. That was the first act of her new duty! And,\noh my dear! that is why I was so concerned when I found that after all\nshe was not in the house. I don't understand it; there must be something\non foot that I don't know; and I am full of fear!\" Here the old lady\nquite broke down. I felt that any self control now was precious. It\nwould not do to leave Mrs. Jack in ignorance of the danger, so I told\nher in as few words as I could of the blackmailing going on and of\nthe watch set by the United States Secret Service. At first she was\noverwhelmed; but her early apprenticeship to dangers of all kinds stood\nher in good stead. Very soon her agitation took practical shape. I told\nher I was off to seek for help, and that she must keep the house till I\nreturned. I would have tried the secret tunnel, but from what Mrs. Jack\nhad said I was convinced that Marjory had never left the house of her\nown accord. If she had been captured she was doubtless far away by this\ntime. It was possible that the blackmailers had found the secret passage\ninto the Castle by which Don Bernardino had come. Here the thought came\nto me in full force; that was how they had discovered it. They had\nseen and watched the Don!... I felt that another debt for our day of\nreckoning had been piled up against him.\n\nI got in the cart again and went to Cruden as hard as the mare could go.\nAs I went, I formed my plans, and had my telegrams made up in my mind\nready to write them out at once. For a while I doubted whether I should\ngo to another telegraph office, lest the Cruden people might come to\nknow too much. But there was no need of concealment now. I was not\nafraid of any one knowing, though I determined to be discreet and\nsecret if possible. The circuit was occupied, so I found the use of the\npriority telegraph forms Adams had sent me. There was not a moment lost;\none was being despatched whilst I was writing the next. To Adams I said:\n\n\"They have succeeded: Wire men see me at Crom right away. Come if you\ncan. Want all help can get. Time vital....\"\n\nTo Cathcart I wired at his house in Invernesshire:\n\n\"Come to me without moment's delay. Vital. Want every kind of help.\" I\nknew he would understand, and would come armed.\n\nAs it would be some little time before anything could be done, I\ndetermined to find Don Bernardino if possible; and induce him to show me\nthe secret exit. Without knowledge of this we would be powerless; with\nit we might find some clue. I did not make up my mind as to what I would\ndo if he refused; but to myself the instinctive grinding of my teeth,\nand clenching of my fingers, seemed to answer my question. Of one thing\nI was glad, he was a gentleman. In such a matter as that in which I was\nengaged, there were possibilities, if even there were not definite hope.\n\nI drove to Ellon; and from the agent there got his address. I soon found\nit; an old-fashioned house near the town, in a tiny park surrounded with\ngreat trees. I left the cart on the road, with the mare tethered to the\ngate post, there being no lodgekeeper or no lodge. Before I rang the\nhall-door bell I saw that my revolver was ready to my hand. The instant\nthe door was opened I stepped in, and said to the old woman who opened\nit:\n\n\"Mr. Barnard is in the study I suppose? I have pressing business with\nhim!\" She was so taken aback by the suddenness of my entry and speech\nthat she pointed to a door saying: \"He is in there.\"\n\nAs I entered the room, closing the door behind me, the Don, who had been\nseated in a large chair with his back to the door turned unconcernedly.\nHe had evidently not expected any disturbing visitor. The instant he\nsaw me, however, he leaped to his feet, all his hostility awake. As\nhe scanned my face his concern grew; and he glanced around, as though\nseeking for some weapon. I put my hand on my revolver, and said as\nquietly as I could, remembering his own precision of manner:\n\n\"Forgive my intrusion, Sir; but I have urgent need of speech with you.\"\nI suppose there was something in my tone which bore home to his brain\nthe idea that I had changed in some way since we had met. Do what I\nwould, I could not conceal the anxiety of my voice. After a pause he\nsaid:\n\n\"Regarding the treasure?\"\n\n\"No!\" said I: \"Since last night I have not even given it a thought.\" A\nstrange, new look came over his face, a look in which hope and concern\nseemed to have equal parts. He paused again; I could see he was\nthinking. Mechanically I tapped my foot on the floor with impatience;\nthe golden moments were flying by. He realised my gravity of purpose,\nand, manifestly turning his attention to me, said:\n\n\"Speak on Senor!\" By this time I had well in my mind what I intended to\nsay. It was not my purpose to further antagonise the Spaniard; at the\noutset at any rate. Later on, that might be necessary; but I should\nexhaust other means first.\n\n\"I have come, Sir, to ask your aid, the help of a gentleman; and I feel\nat a loss how to ask it.\" Through the high-bred courtesy of the\nSpaniard's manner came a note of bitterness, as he answered:\n\n\"Alas! Senor, I know the feeling. Have not I myself asked on such a\nplea; and stooped in vain!\" I had nothing to say in reply to this, so\nwent on:\n\n\"Sir, I am aware that you can make much sacrifice: I ask, not for\nmyself, but for a lady in peril!\" He answered quickly:\n\n\"A lady! in peril! Say on Senor!\" There was such hope and purpose in his\nquick tone that my heart instinctively leaped as I went on:\n\n\"In peril, sir; of life; of honour. To you I appeal to lay aside your\nfeelings of hate towards me, however just they may be; and come like a\ntrue gentleman to her aid. I am emboldened to ask this because it was,\nI think, by your act that the peril--the immediate peril, has come to\nher.\" He flushed at once:\n\n\"Through me! Peril to a lady's honour through me! Have a care, sir! Have\na care!\" With a rush I went on:\n\n\"By your going into the castle through a secret passage, other enemies\nof the lady, low, base and unscrupulous who have been plotting to carry\nher off for ransom, have doubtless made an entry otherwise impossible to\nthem. Now we must find a clue, and at once. Tell me, I implore you, of\nthe secret way; that thus we may at once begin our search.\" For a few\nseconds he looked me through and through; I think he suspected some plot\nor trap, for he said slowly:\n\n\"And the treasure; can you leave it?\" I answered hotly:\n\n\"The treasure! I have not even thought of it since the news came of\nMarjory's disappearance!\" Here I took it that he was beginning his\nunscrupulous purpose, and was playing my loss against his own; and a\nthought came to me that had not even crossed my mind before--had he been\nthe abductor for the purpose of just such a bargain? I took from my\npocket the key of the house in Whinnyfold and held it out to him. \"Here\nSir\" I said \"is the key of my house. Take it with all it contains, and\nall it leads to! The treasure is as you left it last night; only help me\nin my need.\"\n\nHe waved my hand aside with an impatient gesture as he said simply:\n\n\"I do not bargain with a woman's honour. Such comes before all the\ntreasures of Popes or Kings; before the oath and duty of a de Escoban.\nCome! Senor, there is no time to lose. Let us settle this affair first;\nlater we can arrange matters that rest between thee and me!\"\n\n\"Your hand, Sir\" was all I could say. \"In such trouble as mine, there is\nno help like that of a gentleman. But will you not honour me by keeping\nthe key? This other is a trust which you have won by honour; as your\ngreat ancestor won his glorious duty long ago.\" He did not hesitate; all\nhe said as he took the key was:\n\n\"It is a part of my duty which I must not forego.\"\n\nAs we left the house he looked like a new man--a man born again; there\nwas such joyous gladness in his face and voice and movements that I\nwondered. I could not help saying when we had got into the cart and were\non our way:\n\n\"You seem happy, Sir. I would that I could feel the same.\"\n\n\"Ah, Senor, I am happy beyond belief. I am happy as one raised from Hell\nto Heaven. For now my honour is no more perilled. God has been good to\nme to show a way, even to death, without dishonour.\"\n\nAs we flew along to Crom I told him what I knew of the secret passage\nbetween the chapel and the monument. He wondered at my having discovered\nthe secret; but when I told him of how the blackmailing gang had used\nthe way to evade the Secret Service men, he suddenly cried out:\n\n\"There was but one who ever knew the secret of that passage; my kinsman,\nwith whom I stayed in Crom when young, told me of him. He tried much to\nfind the entrance to the Castle, and finally under threat he went away\nto America. He was a base-born and a thief. It must be he who has come\nback after these years and has told of the secret way. Alas! they must\nhave watched me when I went, all unsuspicious; and so discovered the\nother secret.\" Then he tried to explain where the entrance was. It was\nnot in the chamber where we had expected it would be, but in a narrow\ncorner of the stair, the whole corner being one stone and forming the\nentrance.\n\nWhen we arrived at Crom we found that the Secret Service men were\nwaiting for me, having been instructed from London. There were also\ntelegrams from Adams and Cathcart saying that they were on the way to\njoin me. Adams wired from Aberdeen, and Cathcart from Kingussie. Mrs.\nJack was with the detectives and had taken them through the rooms which\nMarjory had used. They had had up the servants one by one and examined\nthem as to what they knew. The chief man had insisted on this; he said\nmatters were now too serious to play the fool any longer. The servants\nwere not told anything, even that Marjory was missing; but of course\nthey had their suspicions. A peremptory order was given that no one\nshould leave the house without permission. The chief confided to me that\nMrs. Jack had quite broken down when she was telling him that Marjory\nknew all along about the blackmailers and had never told her. \"But she's\nall right now, Sir,\" he concluded. \"That old lady is just full of sand;\nand I tell you her head is level. She's been thinking of everything\nwhich could possibly be of use to us. I guess I have heard more of\nthis racket within the last half hour than I have done in the last two\nweeks.\"\n\nBy the instructions of Don Bernardino we went into the library. I asked\nMrs. Jack to send for lamps and candles, and these were brought shortly.\nIn the meantime I asked that one of the detectives should be sent into\nthe old chapel and another to the monument on the hill. Both were warned\nto have their guns ready, and to allow no one to pass at any hazard. To\neach before going I explained the secret mode of entry.\n\nThe Don went over to one of the book-cases--the very section containing\nthe shelf in which I had replaced the old law book. Taking out that\nparticular volume, he put his hand in and pressed a spring. There was a\nfaint click. He replaced the book and pressed against the bookcase with\nslow level pressure. Very slowly it seemed to give way before him; and\nthen turning on a hinge at one side, left an open cavity through which a\nman could easily pass. I was about to rush in, and was quite ready, with\na lamp in one hand and a revolver in the other, when the chief of the\ndetectives laid a restraining hand on my arm as he said:\n\n\"Wait a moment. If you go too fast you may obliterate some sign which\nwould give us a clue!\" The wisdom of his speech was not to be gainsaid.\nInstinctively I fell back; two of the trained observers drew close to\nthe doorway, and holding their lamp in such wise as to throw light all\nround the opening, began an exact scrutiny. One of them knelt down and\nexamined the flooring; the other confined his attention to roof and\nwalls. After a silence, lasting perhaps a minute, the man kneeling stood\nup and said:\n\n\"Not a doubt about it! There has been a violent struggle here at the\ndoorway!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIV\n\nTHE VOICE IN THE DUST\n\n\nOne of the men produced his note book and began taking down in shorthand\nthe rapid utterances of the chief, repeating it so as to check the\naccuracy as he went on:\n\n\"Easy to see the marks; the floor is deep in dust, and the walls are\nthick with it. On floor, mark of several feet--confused in struggle, may\narticulate separately later on--one woman's--also trailing of long\nskirt. On walls marks of hands, fingers outspread, as if trying to\ngrasp. Some of the long marks down the wall others across.\" The speaker\nhere raised his lamp and held it in the opening as far as his arm would\ngo; then he went on:\n\n\"Steps wind downwards to right. Struggle seems to have stopped.\nFootmarks more clear.\"... Then the chief turned to us:\n\n\"I think gentlemen, we may follow in now. The footmarks may be\ndiscriminated and identified later. We must chance destroying them, or\nwe cannot pass in this narrow passage.\" Here I spoke; a thought had been\nsurging up in my brain ever since the detective had pointed out the\nfinger marks on the wall \"down and across\":\n\n\"Stop a moment please! Let me see the marks on the wall before any one\nenters; the passage is narrow and they may be rubbed off.\" A glance was\nenough, just time enough to formulate which was the symbol of \"a\" and\nwhich of \"b.\" The perpendicular strokes were \"a\" and the horizontal \"b.\"\nMarjory had kept her head, even at this trying time, and was leaving a\nmessage for me as she was forced along. I understood why the struggle\nhad ceased. Seized and forced through the narrow doorway, she had at\nfirst struggled hard. Then, when she realised that she could leave a\nclue behind her, she had evidently agreed to go quietly; for so she\nmight have her hands free. It would be a hard job to carry or force\nalong an unwilling captive through that narrow uneven passage; doubtless\nthe captors were as willing as she was that she should go quietly. I\nsaid to the detectives:\n\n\"These marks on the wall are in a cipher which I can read. Give me the\nbest lamp we have, and let me go first.\"\n\nSo, in an orderly procession, leaving two men in the library with Mrs.\nJack to guard the entrance, we passed into the secret passage. As I read\noff the words written on the wall, the man with the note-book took them\ndown, his companion holding a candle so as to enable him to do so. How\nmy heart beat as I read my dear girl's message, marked on the wall on\nthe inner side whichever way the curves ran. Obviously it would create\nless attention by guiding herself in this wise as she passed. She had\nkept her hand well down so that her signs should not be confused with\nthe marks made by the men who, guiding themselves likewise, had held\ntheir hands at a natural height. Her sign marks ran continuously,\neven after we had passed into the passage between the chapel and the\nmonument; the writing ran as follows:\n\n\"Four men came in--two waiting in passage through bookcase--late--striking\none--struggled--then quiet--hands free--same voice we heard in Chapel.\nFeathers thin voice, small man, dark--all masked--Whisky Tommy hoarse\nvoice, big man, sandy, large hands--Dago, deep voice, swarthy, little\nfinger missing left hand--Max, silent, nods for speech, think dumb--two\nothers on ahead too far see, hear.\"\n\nIn a pause I heard the chief detective murmur:\n\n\"That girl's a peach. We'll get her yet!\" The spot at which we were\npausing was where the way to the reservoir branched off. Here Marjory\nprobably stood with her back to the wall and used her hands behind her\nback, for the strokes were smaller and more uneven. There were faults\nwhich put me out and I could only read a few words--\"whispering\"--\"only\nword can hear 'manse.'\" There was evidently some conversation going on\nbetween her captors, and she was making use of her opportunities. Then\nwe went on and found the signs renewed. It cut me to the heart when I\nsaw a smear of blood on one of the marks; the rough uncertain movement\nand the sharp edges of the rock had told on her delicate skin. But later\non, the blood marks were continued, and I could not but think that she\nhad cut her fingers on purpose to make a more apparent clue. When I\nmentioned my surmise to the detective, his instinct having been trained\nin such matters, showed a keener insight than my own:\n\n\"More likely she is preparing to leave a mark which we can see when they\nget her out of the tunnel. They may not suspect intention if her fingers\nare bleeding already!\" The words following the stop where I had read\n\"manse\" were:\n\n\"Boat ready--Seagull--Coffin--Hearse--bury isl--\" Here the next mark\ninstead of being horizontal took a sudden angle down, and the blood was\nroughly rubbed off. It was as though her hand had been struck in the act\nof making the mark. Her captors had suspected her. There were no more\nmarks on the wall. I could not imagine, however, that Marjory would be\nentirely baffled. She had infinite resource, and would doubtless find\nsome other means of leaving a clue. Telling the others therefore to keep\nback I threw the rays of the lamp over roof and walls and floor as we\nproceeded.\n\nIt was a strange scene. The candles and lamp showing up but patches of\nlight in the inky black darkness; the moving figures projected against\nthe lights as I looked back; the silence broken by the shuffling tread\nof stumbling feet on the rock floor; the eager intense faces, when a\nchange in the light flashed them into view. It all moved me at moments,\nfor there was a gleam of hope in its earnestness.\n\nI tried to put myself in Marjory's position. If her hands were useless,\nas they would be if she could not use them without suspicion--even were\nthey not tied now as was probable--her next effort would be with her\nfeet; I therefore looked out carefully for any sign made this way.\nPresently I came across a mark which I suspected. It was only a few\nsteps beyond the last mark on the wall. It was a sort of drag of the\nfoot, where there was any slight accumulation of dust, or rubbish, or\nsand. There were more such traces ahead. So motioning to the others to\nkeep back, I followed them up, taking care not to disturb any of them.\nThey were but the rough marks made during a stumbling progress; and for\na time I was baffled; though I could distinguish the traces of Marjory's\nlittle feet amongst the great ones. Then I went back and looked at them\nafresh from the beginning, and a light burst upon me. They were made\nwith the right or left foot as required; thus she could reproduce the\nbi-literal symbol. Interpretation was now easy enough, and hence on, to\nthe exit from the tunnel, I could tell almost every word written. There\nbeing only a few cases where the sign was not sufficiently marked for\nme to read it.\n\n\"Suspicious. Hands tied--gagged--find Seagull--find Manse.\"\n\nIt was sadly slow work, and my heart at times sank within me at the\nexasperating delay in our progress. However, it was progress after\nall; and that sustained us. All along, as we worked our way towards\nthe monument, I had been thinking of the word \"manse;\" and now its\nrepetition showed its importance. It would be necessary that the\nabductors have some place in which to conceal their captive, before they\nshould be able to get her out of the country. That this latter would be\na necessary step towards their object was manifest; but the word\n_Seagull_ settled it.\n\nWhen we got to the entrance of the tunnel we examined every inch of the\nway; this was the wish of the detective rather than my own. Marjory\nwould, it seemed to me, go quietly through the entrance. She would\nknow that she was being watched here with extra carefulness; and would\nreserve herself for a less suspicious opportunity. She would also know\nthat if I were on her track at all, I would be able to follow through\nthe secret entrance.\n\nOutside, on the ground beside the monument, were no unusual signs\nof passage. The patch of bare earth and gravel, which we had before\nnoticed, left no trace of footsteps. Those who had used it had evidently\ntaken care that there should be no sign. We went slowly along the\nroute, which, by my former experiments with the thread, I had found was\nhabitually used. Presently one of the Americans asked me to stop, as he\nhad seen a trace of feet. For my life I could distinguish nothing in the\nseemingly undisturbed mass of pine needles. But the man, who in his\nyouth had been in Indian country, had learned something of tracking;\nhe could interpret signs unseen to others with less highly developed\ninstincts. He went down on his knees and examined the ground, inch by\ninch, using a microscope. For some ten yards he crawled along on hands\nand knees engaged in this way. Then he stood up and said:\n\n\"There's no error about it now. There are six men and a woman. They have\nbeen carrying her, and have let her down here!\" We did not challenge his\nreport, or even ask how he had arrived at it; we were all well content\nto accept it.\n\nWe then moved on in the manifest direction in which the ground trended;\nwe were working towards the high road which ran past the gates of Crom.\nI asked the others to let me go first now, for I knew this would be\nMarjory's chance to continue her warning. Surely enough, I saw presently\na slight disturbance in the pine needles, and then another and another.\nI spelled out the word \"Manse\" and again \"Manse\" and later on \"try all\nManses near.\" Then the sign writing ceased; we had come out of the wood\non to a grass field which ran down to the high road. Here, outside a gap\nat the bottom of the field, were the marks in the dust of several feet,\nthe treading of horses, and the ruts of wheels. A little further on,\nthe wheel marks--some four-wheeled vehicle--were heavy; and from the\nbackward propulsion of the dust and gravel in the hoof-tracks we could\neasily see that the horses were galloping.\n\nWe stopped and held a council of war. It was, of course understood by us\nall that some one should follow on the track of the carriage, and try to\nreach the quarry this way. For my own part, I felt that to depend on a\nwheel mark, in such a country of cross roads, was only the off chance.\nIn any case, this stern chase must be a long one; whereas time was\nvital, every moment being precious. I determined to try to follow out\nMarjory's clue. \"Try every Manse near.\" To do this we should get to\nsome centre where we could obtain a list of all the churches in the\nneighbourhood. Ellon was naturally the place, as it was in the centre of\nthe district. They all acquiesced in my view; so we hurried back to\nCrom, leaving two men, the tracker and another, to follow the fugitives.\nHitherto Don Bernardino had hardly said a word. He was alert, and the\neager light of his eye was helpful; but after he had shown us the secret\nway, and found that already I knew the outer passage as well as he did,\nor better, he had contented himself with watchfulness. Now he suggested:\n\n\"There is also the boat! May it not be well that some one should follow\nup that side of the matter? Thus we shall be doubly armed.\"\n\nHis advice commended itself to the chief of the detectives; though I\ncould see that he took it suspiciously from the Spaniard. It was with\nmanifest purpose of caution that he answered:\n\n\"Quite right! But that we shall see to ourselves; when Mr. Adams comes\nhe will work that racket!\" The Spaniard bowed, and the American returned\nthe courtesy with a stiff back. Even in such a time of stress, racial\nmatters were not to be altogether forgotten.\n\nIn the hall at Crom, we found, when we came back through the old chapel,\nSam Adams. He had arrived just after we had set out on our search, but\nwas afraid to follow over-ground lest he should miss us; wisely he did\nnot attempt the underground way as he had no proper light. His coming\nhad been a great comfort to Mrs. Jack, who, always glad to see a\ncountryman of her own, now almost clung to him. He had brought with him\ntwo young men, the very sight of whom made my heart warmer. One of them\nhe introduced as \"Lootenant Jackson of West Point\" and the other as\n\"Lootenant Montgomery of Annapolis.\" \"These boys are all right!\" he\nadded, laying a hand affectionately on the shoulder of each.\n\n\"I am sure they are! Gentlemen, I thank you with all my heart for\ncoming!\" I said as I wrung their hands. They were both fine specimens\nof the two war Academies of the United States. Clean-built from top to\ntoe; bright-eyed, resolute and alert; the very type of highly bred and\ntrained gentlemen. The young soldier Jackson answered me:\n\n\"I was too delighted to come, when Adams was good enough to get leave\nfor me.\"\n\n\"Me too!\" echoed the sailor \"When I heard that Miss Drake was in\ntrouble, and I was told I might come, I think I danced. Why, Sir, if you\nwant them, we've only to pass the word, and we can get you a man of\nwar's crew--if every man of them has to desert!\"\n\nWhilst we were speaking there was a sound of rapid wheels, and a\ncarriage from Ellon drew up at the door. Out jumped Cathcart, followed\nby a tall, resolute looking young man who moved with the freedom of an\nathlete.\n\n\"Am I in time?\" was Cathcart's greeting as he rushed towards me. I told\nhim exactly how we stood. \"Thank God!\" he said fervently \"we may be in\ntime yet.\" Then he introduced his friend MacRae of Strathspiel. This was\nthe host with whom he had been staying; and who had volunteered to come,\non hearing of his summons:\n\n\"You may trust Donald!\" was his simple evidence of the worth of his\nfriend.\n\nThis addition to our forces gave us great hope. We had now a sufficiency\nof intelligent, resolute men to follow up several clues at once; and in\na brief council we marked out the various duties of each. Cathcart was\nto go to Ellon and get a list of all the manses in the region of\nBuchan, and try to find out if any of them had been let to strangers. We\ntook it for granted that none of the clergy of the place were themselves\nconcerned in the plot. MacRae was to go with Cathcart and to get all the\nsaddle horses he could without attracting public attention, and bring\nthem, or have them brought, to Crom as soon as possible. Secrecy of\nmovement was insisted on with almost agonised fervour by Adams and the\nSecret Service men. \"You don't know these wretches,\" said the chief of\nthe latter \"They are the most remorseless and cruel villains in the\nworld; and if they are driven to bay will do anything however cruel or\nbase. They are well plucked too, and don't know what fear means. They\nwill take any chances, and do anything to get their way and protect\nthemselves. If we don't go right in this matter, we may regret it to the\nlast of our days.\"\n\nThe silence in the room was only broken by the grinding of teeth, and by\nMrs. Jack's suppressed sobs.\n\nAdams was to go to Aberdeen as a working centre, and was to look after\nthe nautical side of the adventure; he was to have Montgomery in this\nwork with him. Before he left Crom, he wrote some cipher telegrams to\nthe Embassy. He explained to me that one of his suggestions was that\nan American war-ship which was cruising in the North Sea should, if\npossible, be allowed to lie off the coast of Aberdeen ready for any\nemergency. When Montgomery heard it, he asked that if possible a message\nshould be sent from him to the first officer of the _Keystone_: \"Tell\nthe men privately that they are helping Marjory Drake!--There will\nbe a thousand pair of eyes on the watch then!\" he added by way of\nexplanation.\n\nI was to wait with the detectives till we should get word from any of\nour sources as to what could be done.\n\nFor there were several possibilities. The trackers might mark down the\nlocality where the prisoner was hidden. Cathcart might, before this,\ncome with the list of manses and their occupants. Adams or Montgomery\nmight get wind of the _Seagull_; for Montgomery had already orders to go\nto Petershead and Fraserburgh, where the smacks for the summer fishing\nwere gathered.\n\nDon Bernardino remained with me at Crom.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLV\n\nDANGER\n\n\nThe time of waiting was inconceivably long and dreary. When Marjory and\nI had been waiting for death in the water-cave, we thought that nothing\ncould be so protracted; but now I knew better. Then, we had been\ntogether, and whatever came, even death itself, would be shared by us.\nBut now I was alone; and Marjory away, and in danger. In what danger I\nknew not, I could only imagine; and at every new thought of fear and\nhorror I ground my teeth afresh and longed for action. Fortunately there\nwas something to do. The detectives wanted to know all I could tell\nthem. At the first, the chief had asked that Mrs. Jack would get all the\nservants of the house together so that he might see them. She had so\narranged matters that they would be together in the servants' hall, and\nhe went down to inspect. He did not stay long; but came back to me at\nonce with an important look on his face. He closed the door and coming\nclose to me said:\n\n\"I knew there was something wrong below stairs! That footman has\nskipped!\" For a few seconds I did not realise what he meant, and asked\nhim to explain.\n\n\"That footman that went out gallavantin' at nights. He's in it, sure.\nWhy isn't he in the hall where the others are? Just you ask the old lady\nabout him. It'll be less suspicious than me doing it.\" Then it dawned on\nme what he meant.\n\n\"There is no footman in the house!\" I said.\n\n\"That's so, Mister. That's just what I'm tellin'! Where is he?\"\n\n\"There is none; they don't have any male servants in the house. The only\nmen are in the stables in the village.\"\n\n\"Then that makes it worse still. There is a man who I've seen myself\nsteal out of the house after dark, or in the dusk; and sneak back again\nout of the wood in the grey of the dawn. Why, I've reported it to Mr.\nAdams. Didn't he warn you about it; he said he would.\"\n\n\"He did that.\"\n\n\"And didn't you take his tip?\"\n\n\"No!\" here from the annoyed expression of his face I took warning.\nIt would never do to chagrin the man and set him against me by any\nsuspicion of ridicule. So I went on:\n\n\"The fact is, my friend, that this was a disguise. It was Mar--Miss\nDrake who used it!\" He was veritably surprised; his amazement was\nmanifest in his words:\n\n\"Miss Drake! And did she put on the John Thomas livery? In the name of\nthunder, why?\"\n\n\"To escape you!\"\n\n\"To escape me! Wall, I'm damned! That elegant young lady to put on\nlivery; and to escape me!\"\n\n\"Yes; you and the others. She knew you were watching her! Of course she\nwas grateful for it!\" I added, for his face fell \"but she couldn't bear\nit all the same. You know what girls are,\" I went on apologetically,\n\"They don't like to be cornered or forced to do anything. She knew you\nwere all clever fellows at your work and didn't take any chances.\" I was\ntrying to conciliate him; but I need not have feared. He was of the\nright sort. He broke into a laugh, slapping his thigh loudly with his\nopen hand as he said heartily:\n\n\"Well, that girl's a daisy! she's a peach; she's \"It\"! To think of her\nwalking out under our noses, and us not having an idea that it might\nbe her, just because we didn't think she'd condescend to put on the\nbreeches--and the footman's at that. Well, it's a pity we didn't get on\nto her curves; for it might have been different! Never mind! We'll take\nher out of her trouble before long; and Mr. Whisky Tommy and his push\nwill have to look out for their skins!\"\n\nThis little episode passed some of the time; but the reaction to the\ndreary waiting was worse than ever. As I began again an endless chain of\nsurmises and misgivings, it occurred to me that Don Bernardino might be\nmade of some use. The blackmailers had evidently watched him; it might\nbe that they would watch him again. If so, he could be the means of a\ntrap being laid. I turned the matter over in my mind, but at present\ncould see no way to realise the idea. It gave me another thought,\nhowever. The Don had been very noble in his attitude to me; and I might\nrepay some of his goodness. Although he was so quiet and silent, I knew\nwell that he must be full of his own anxiety regarding the treasure, now\nexposed as it might be to other eyes than his own. I could ask him to\ngo to see after it. With some diffidence I broached the matter to him,\nfor I did not want in any way to wound him. Since I had determined to\nrelinquish the treasure if necessary, I was loth to make the doing so\nseem like an ungracious act. At first he almost took offence, reminding\nme with overt haughtiness that he had already assured me that all the\ntreasures of Spain or of the Popedom were secondary to a woman's honour.\nI liked him all the better for his attitude; and tried to persuade him\nthat it was his duty to guard this trust, as otherwise it might fall\ninto bad hands. Then a brilliant idea struck me, one which at once met\nthe case and made the possibility of a trap. I told him that as the\nblackmailers had watched him once they might have done so again, and\nhave even followed him to my house. As I was speaking, the thought\nstruck me of how well Providence arranges all for the best. If Don\nBernardino had not taken from the library the typescript of the secret\nwriting, it might have fallen into the hands of the gang. When I\nmentioned the idea to him he said in surprise:\n\n\"But I did not take the papers! I read them on the table; but did not\nthink of moving them. Why, had I done so, I should have at once made\nsuspicion; and it was my purpose to keep the secret if I could.\" An idea\nstruck me and I ran over to the table to look where the papers usually\nwere.\n\nThere was not a sign of them about. Somebody had secured them; it could\nhardly have been Marjory who lacked any possible motive for doing so.\nThe Spaniard, eagerly following my face, saw the amazement which I felt;\nhe cried out:\n\n\"Then they have taken them. The treasure may yet prove a lure through\nwhich we may catch them. If it be that they have followed me to your\nhouse, and if they have any suspicions that came to me on reading that\npaper, then they will surely make some attempt.\" If anything were to be\ntried on this line, there was no time to lose. I had to carry out the\nmatter privately; for on mentioning to Don Bernardino that I should ask\none of the detectives to go with him, he at once drew back.\n\n\"No!\" he said, \"I have no right to imperil further this trust. The\ndiscovery was yours, and you knew of the hiding place before I did; but\nI could not with my consent allow any other person to know the secret.\nMoreover, these men are enemies of my country; and it is not well\nthat they should know, lest they should use their knowledge for their\ncountry's aid. You and I, Senor, are _caballero_. To us there is,\nsomewhere, a high rule of honour; but to these people there is only\nlaw!\"\n\n\"Well,\" I said, \"if you are going, you had better lose no time. These\npeople have had nearly six hours already; I left the house with Mrs.\nJack a little after ten. But you had better go carefully. The men are\ndesperate; and if they find you alone, you may have a bad time.\"\n\nFor answer he pulled a revolver from his pocket. \"Since yesterday,\" he\nsaid, \"I go armed, till these unhappy businesses are all over!\"\n\nI then told him of the entrance to the caves, and gave him the key of\nthe cellar. \"Be sure you have light.\" I cautioned him \"Plenty of light\nand matches. It will be towards low water when you get there. The rope\nwhich we used as a clue is still in its place; we did not take it away.\"\nI could see that this thought was a new source of anxiety to him; if the\ngang were before him it would have served to lead them to the treasure\nitself. As he was going, I bade him remember that if there was any sign\nof the men about, he was to return at once or send us word, so that we\ncould come and catch them like rats in a trap. In any case he was to\nsend us word, so that we might have knowledge of his movements, and\ninferentially of those of our enemies. In such a struggle as ours,\nknowledge was everything.\n\nNot long after he had gone, Cathcart and MacRae arrived on horseback.\nThey said there were three other saddle horses coming after them.\nCathcart had a list of all the churches, and the manses of all the\nclergy of all shades of doctrine, in Buchan; and a pretty formidable\nlist it made. He had also a map of Aberdeen County, and a list of such\nhouses as had been let for the summer or at any period during it. Such\nwas of course only an agent's list, and would not contain every letting\nprivately.\n\nWe set to work at once with the map and the lists; and soon marked the\nnames which were likely to be of any use to us, those which had at any\ntime lately been let to strangers. Then Cathcart and Gordon and all the\ndetectives, except the chief, went off on horseback with a list of\nplaces to visit. They were all to return to report as soon as possible.\nThe chief kept tab of the places to be visited by each. When the rest\nhad gone, I asked him if he knew where any of those supposed to be\nof the gang lived in the neighbourhood. He said he felt awkward in\nanswering the question, and he certainly looked it. \"The fact is,\" he\nsaid sheepishly, \"since that young lady kicked those names on the dirt,\nand so into my thick head, I know pretty well who they are. Had I known\nbefore, I could easily have got those who could identify them; for I\nnever saw them myself. I take it that 'Feathers' is none other than\nFeatherstone who was with Whisky Tommy--which was Tom Mason--in the\nA.\u00c2\u00a0T. Stewart ransom case. If those two are in it, most likely the\none they called the 'Dago' is a half-bred Spaniard that comes from\nsomewheres over here. That Max that she named, if he's the same man,\nis a Dutchman; he's about the worst of the bunch. Then for this\ngame there's likely to be two Chicago bums from the Levee, way-down\npoliticians and heelers. It's possible that there are two more; a man\nfrom Frisco that they call Sailor Ben--what they call a cosmopolite for\nhe doesn't come from nowhere in particular; and a buck nigger from Noo\nOrleans. A real bad 'un he is; of all the.... But I hope he isn't in the\ngang. If he is, we haven't no time to lose.\"\n\nHis words made my blood run cold. Was this the crowd, within whose\ndanger I had consented that Marjory should stand. The worst kind of\nscoundrels from all over the earth. Oh! what it was to be powerless,\nand to know that she was in their hands. It took me all my strength of\npurpose not to weep, out of very despair. I think the detective must\nhave wished to cheer me a little, for he went on:\n\n\"Of course it's not their game to do her any harm, or let harm come to\nher. She's worth too many millions, alive and unharmed, for them to\nspoil their market by any foolishness. It's here that I trust Whisky\nTommy to keep the rest straight. I suppose you know, Sir, that criminals\nalways work in the same way every time. We know that when the Judge\nwouldn't pay up for old A.\u00c2\u00a0T., Featherstone threatened to burn up the\nstiff; but Whisky Tommy knew better than to kill the golden goose like\nthat. Why he went and stole it from Featherstone and hid it somewhere\nabout Trenton till the old lady coughed up about twenty-five thousand.\nTommy's head's level; and if that black devil isn't in the squeeze,\nhe'll keep them up to the collar every time.\"\n\n\"Who is the negro?\" I asked, for I wanted to know the worst. \"What has\nhe done?\"\n\n\"What hasn't he done that's vile, is what I'd like to know. They're a\nhard crowd in the darkey side of Noo Orleans; and a man doesn't get a\nbad name there easily, I tell you. There are dens there that'd make God\nAlmighty blush, or the Devil either; a darkey that is bred in them and\ngets to the top of the push, doesn't stick at no trifles!\n\n\"But you be easy in your mind as yet, Sir; at present there's naught to\nfear. But if once they get safe away, they will try to put the screw on.\nGod knows then what may happen. In the meantime, the only fear is lest,\nif they're in a tight place, they may kill her!\"\n\nMy heart turned to ice at his words. What horrible possibilities were\nthere, when death for my darling was the \"only\" fear. It was in a faint\nenough voice I asked him:\n\n\"Would they really kill her?\"\n\n\"Of course they would; if it was their best course. But don't you be\ndownhearted, Sir. There's not much fear of killing--as yet at all\nevents. These men are out for dough; and for a good heap of it, too.\nThey're not going to throw away a chance till the game's up. If we get\non to their curves quick, they'll have to think of their own skins. It's\nonly when all's up that they'll act; when they themselves must croak if\nshe doesn't!\"\n\nOh! if I had known! If I had had any suspicion of the dangerous nature\nof the game we were playing--that I had consented that Marjory should\nplay--I'd have cut my tongue out before I'd have agreed. I might\nhave known that a great nation like the United States would not have\nconcerned itself as to any danger to an individual, unless there had\nbeen good cause. Oh fool! fool! that I had been!\n\nIf I had been able to do anything, it might not have been so bad. It was\nnecessary, however, that I should be at the very heart and centre of\naction; for I alone knew the different ramifications of things, and\nthere was always something cropping up of which I had better knowledge\nthan the others. And so I had to wait in what patience I could pray for.\nPatience and coolness of head were what were demanded of me for the\npresent. Later on, the time might come when there would be action; and\nI never doubted that when that time did come it would not find me\nwanting--even in the issues of life and death.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLVI\n\nARDIFFERY MANSE\n\n\nIn the dreary time of waiting I talked with the detective chief.\nEverything which he told me seemed to torture me; but there was a weird\nfascination in his experience as it bore on our own matter. I was face\nto face, for the first time in my life, with that callousness which is\nthe outcome of the hard side of the wicked world. Criminal-hunters, as\nwell as criminals, achieve it; so I suppose do all whose fortunes bring\nthem against the sterner sides of life. Now and again it amazed me to\nhear this man, unmistakably a good fellow and an upright one, weighing\nup crime and criminals in a matter-of-fact way, without malice, without\nanger, without vindictiveness. He did seem to exercise in his habitual\nthought of his _clientele_ that constructive condemnation which sways\nthe rest of us in matters of moral judgment. The whole of his work, and\nattitude, and purpose, seemed to be only integral parts of a game which\nwas being played. At that time I thought light of this, and consequently\nof him; but looking back, with judgment in better perspective, I am able\nto realise the value of just such things. There was certainly more\nchance of cooler thought and better judgment under these conditions,\nthan when the ordinary passions and motives of human life held sway.\nThis man did not seem to be chagrined, or put out personally in any way,\nby the failure of his task, or to have any rancour, from this cause, in\nhis heart for those to whom the failure was due. On the contrary, he,\nlike a good sportsman, valued his opponent more on account of the\ncleverness which had baffled him. I imagined that at first he would\nhave been angry when he learned how all the time in which he and his\ncompanions had been watching Crom Castle, and were exulting in the\nsecurity which their presence caused, their enemies had been coming and\ngoing as they wished by a safe way, unknown; and had themselves been the\nwatchers. But there was nothing of the kind; I really believe that,\nleaving out of course the possibly terrible consequences of his failure,\nhe enjoyed the defeat which had come to him. In his own way he put it\ncleverly:\n\n\"Those ducks knew their work well. I tell you this, in spite of the\nsofties we have been, it isn't easy to play any of us for a sucker. Just\nfancy! the lot of us on sentry-go day and night round the castle, for,\nmind you, we never neglected the job for one half hour; and all the\ntime, three lots of people--this push, you and the girl, and this Dago\nlord of yours--all going and coming like rabbits in a warren. What\npuzzles me is how you and Miss Drake managed to escape the observation\nof Whisky Tommy's lot, even if you went through us!\"\n\nIt had been after five o'clock when the party set out to visit the\nmanses; at six o'clock the reports began to come in. The first was a\nmessage scribbled on a leaf torn from a note book, and sent in one of\nthe envelopes taken for the purpose.\n\n\"All right at Auquharney.\" From this on, messengers kept arriving,\nsome on foot, some on horseback, some in carts: but each bearing a\nsimilar message, though couched in different terms. They came from\nAuchlenchries, Heila, Mulonachie, Ardendraught, Inverquohomery,\nSkelmuir, and Auchorachan. At nine o'clock the first of the searchers\nreturned. This was Donald MacRae; knowing the country he had been able\nto get about quicker than any of the others who had to keep to the\nmain roads. His report was altogether satisfactory; he had been to six\nplaces, and in each of them there was no ground for even suspicion.\n\nIt was nearly three hours before the rest were in, but all with the same\nstory; in none of the manses let to visitors through an agent, and in\nnone if occupied by their incumbents, could the fugitives have hidden.\nThe last to come in were the two trackers, disappointed and weary. They\nhad lost the track several times; but had found it again on some cross\nroad. They had finally lost it in a dusty road near Ardiffery and had\nonly given up when the light had altogether gone. They themselves\nthought their loss was final, for they could not take up the track\nwithin a quarter of a mile of either side of the spot where they had\nlost it.\n\nIt was now too late to do anything more for this night; so, after a\nmeal, all the men, except one who remained on watch, went to sleep for a\nfew hours. We must start again before dawn. For myself I could not rest;\nI should have gone mad, I think, if I had to remain the night without\ndoing something. So I determined to wheel over to Whinnyfold and see how\nDon Bernardino had progressed. I was anxious, as I had not heard from\nhim.\n\nAt Whinnyfold all was still, and there was no sign of light in the\nhouse. I had brought with me the duplicate key which I had given to\nMarjory, and which Mrs. Jack found for me on her dressing table; but\nwhen I inserted it, it would not turn. It was a Yale lock; and it was\nnot likely that it should have got out of order without the use of\nsome force or clumsiness. I put it down in the first instance to the\ninexperience of the Don in such mechanism. Anyhow, there was nothing to\nbe done as to entry by that way, so I went round to the back to see if\nI could make an entry there. It was all safe, however; I had taken care\nto fasten every door and window on the previous night. As the front door\nwas closed to me, it was only by force that I could effect entrance to\nmy own house. I knocked softly at the door, and then louder; I thought\nperhaps, for some reason to be explained, the Don had remained in the\nhouse and might now be asleep. There was no sound, however, and I began\nto have grave doubts in my own mind as to whether something serious\nmight have happened. If so, there was no time to lose. Anything having\ngone wrong meant that the blackmailers had been there. If I had to break\nopen the door I might as well do it myself; for if I should get help\nfrom the village, discussion and gossip would at once begin, if only\nfrom the fact that I could not wait till morning.\n\nI got a scaffold pole from the yard where some of the builder's material\nstill remained, and managed by raising it on my shoulder and making a\nquick run forward to strike the door with it just over the lock. The\nblow was most efficacious; the door flew open so quickly that the handle\nbroke against the wall of the passage. For a few seconds I paused,\nlooking carefully round to see if the sound had brought any one to the\nspot; but all was still. Then carefully, and with my revolver ready in\nmy right hand and the lamp of my bicycle in my left, I entered the\nhouse.\n\nA glance into each of the two sitting-rooms of the ground floor showed\nme that there was no one there; so I closed the hall-door again, and\npropped it shut with the scaffold pole. Quickly I ran over the house\nfrom top to bottom, looking into every room and space where anyone could\nhide. The cellar door was locked. It was odd indeed; there was not a\nsign of Don Bernardino anywhere. With a sudden suspicion I turned into\nthe dining-room and looked on the table, where the several caskets which\nwe had taken from the cave had lain.\n\nThere was not a sign of them! Some one had carried them off.\n\nFor a while I thought it must have been Don Bernardino. There came back\nto me very vividly the conversation which we had had in that very room\nonly a day before; I seemed to see the red light of his eyes blaze\nagain, as when he had told me that he would not stop at anything to\ngain possession of the treasure. It must have been, that when he found\nhimself in possession, the desire overcame him to take away the treasure\nto where he could himself control it.\n\nBut this belief was only momentary. Hard upon its heels came the\nremembrance of his noble attitude when I had come to ask his help for a\nwoman in distress--I who had refused his own appeal to my chivalry only\na few hours before. No! I would not believe that he could act so now. In\nstrength of my belief I spoke aloud: \"No! I will not believe it!\"\n\nWas it an echo to my words? or was it some mysterious sound from the sea\nbeneath? Sound there certainly was, a hollow, feeble sound that seemed\nto come from anywhere, or nowhere. I could not locate it at all. There\nwas but one part of the house unsearched, so I got a great piece of wood\nand broke open the door of the cellar. There was no one in it, but the\nsquare hole in the centre of it seemed like a mystery itself. I listened\na moment; and the hollow sound came again, this time through the hole.\n\nThere was some one in the cave below, and the sound was a groan.\n\nI lit a torch and leaning over the hole looked down. The floor below\nwas covered with water, but it was only a few inches deep and out of\nit came the face of the Spaniard, looking strangely white despite its\nnatural swarthiness. I called to him. He evidently heard me, for he\ntried to answer; but I could distinguish nothing, I could only hear a\ngroan of agony. I rigged up the windlass, and taking with me a spare\npiece of rope lowered myself into the cave. I found Don Bernardino just\nconscious; he was unable, seemingly, to either understand my questions\nor to make articulate reply. I tied the spare rope round him, there\nbeing no time or opportunity to examine him as he lay in the water, and\ntaking the spare end with me pulled myself up again. Then, putting the\nrope to which he was attached on the windlass, I easily drew him up to\nthe cellar.\n\nA short time sufficed to give him some brandy, and to undress him and\nwrap him in rugs. He shivered at first, but the warmth soon began to\naffect him. He got drowsy, and seemed all at once to drop asleep. I lit\na fire and made some tea and got provisions ready. In less than half an\nhour he awoke, refreshed and quite coherent. Then he told me all that\nhad passed. He had opened the door without trouble, and had looked into\nthe dining-room where he found the caskets still on the table. He did\nnot think of searching the house. He got a light and went into the\ncellar, leaving the door open, and set about examining the winch, so as\nto know the mechanism sufficiently well as to be able to raise and lower\nhimself. Whilst stooping over the hole, he got a violent blow on the\nback of the head which deprived him of his senses. When he became\nconscious again there were four men in the cellar, all masked. He\nhimself was tied up with ropes and gagged. The men lowered each other\ntill only one remained on guard. He heard them calling to each other.\nAfter a long wait they had come back, all of them carrying heavy burdens\nwhich they began to haul up by the windlass. He said that it creaked\nloudly with the weight as they worked it. He had the unutterable chagrin\nof seeing them pack up in sacks and bags, extemporised from the material\nin the house, the bullion of the treasure which his ancestor had\nundertaken to guard, and to which he had committed his descendants\nuntil the trust should have been fulfilled. When all was ready for\ndeparture--which was not for many hours, and when two of the men had\nreturned with a cart of some sort, whose wheels he heard rumbling--they\nconsulted as to what they should do with him. There was no disguise made\nof their intent; all was spoken in his hearing with the most brutal\nfrankness. One man, whom he described as with grey lips of terrific\nthickness, and whose hands were black, was for knifing him at once or\ncutting his throat, and announced his own readiness to do the job. He\nwas overruled, however, by another, presumably the leader of the gang,\nwho said there was no use taking extra risks. \"Let us put him into the\ncave,\" he said. \"He may break his neck; but anyhow it does not matter\nfor the tide is rising fast and if anyone should come they will find\nthat he met his death by an accident.\"\n\nThis suggestion was carried out; he was, after the ropes and gag were\nremoved with the utmost care but with the utmost brutality, lowered into\nthe cave. He remembered no more till the deadly silence around him was\nbroken by the sound, seemingly far away, of a heavy blow on wood which\nreverberated.\n\nI examined him all over carefully, but could find no definite harm done\nto him. This knowledge in itself cheered him up, and his strength and\nnerve began to come back; with his strength came determination. He\ncould, however, tell me nothing of the men who had attacked him. He said\nhe would know their voices again, but, what with their masks and his\ncramped position, he could not see enough to distinguish anything.\n\nWhilst he was recovering himself I looked carefully round the room and\nhouse. From the marks at one of the windows at the back I gathered that\nthis was the means by which they had gained admission. They were expert\nhousebreakers; and as I gathered from the detective that Whisky Tommy\nwas a bank burglar--most scientific and difficult of all criminal\ntrades, except perhaps, banknote forgery--I was not surprised that they\nhad been able to gain admittance. None of the jewels which Marjory and I\nhad taken from the cave were left behind. The robbers had evidently made\naccurate search; even the rubies, which I had left in the pocket of the\nshooting-coat which I had worn in the cave, had disappeared.\n\nOne thing I gathered from their visit; they evidently felt secure as to\nthemselves. They dared not risk so long delay had not their preparations\nbeen complete; and they must have been satisfied as to the mechanism\nof their escape since they could burden themselves with such weight of\ntreasure. Moreover, their hiding place, wherever it was, could not be\nfar off. There were engaged in this job four men; besides, there were\nprobably watchers. Marjory had only recorded in her cipher six engaged\nin her abduction, when presumably their full strength would have been\nneeded in case of unexpected difficulties or obstacles. The Secret\nService chief presumed at least eight. I determined, therefore, that I\nwould get back to Crom as soon as possible, and, with the aid of this\nnew light, consult as to what was best to be done. I wanted to take Don\nBernardino with me, or to try to get a trap to take him on; but he said\nhe would be better remaining where he was. \"I can be of no use to any\none till I get over this shock,\" he said. \"The rest here, if I remain\nlonger, will do me good; and in the morning I may be able to help.\" I\nasked him if he was not afraid to be left alone in his present helpless\ncondition: His reply showed great common sense:\n\n\"The only people whom I have to fear are the last who will come to this\nplace!\"\n\nI made him as comfortable as I could, and fixed the catch of the door so\nthat the lock would snap behind me. Then I got on my bicycle and rode to\nCrom as quickly as I could. As it was now nearly early morning the men\nwere getting ready for their day's work. Cathcart and I discussed the\nnew development with the detective chief. I did not tell him of the\ntreasure. It was gone; and all I could do was to spare the Spaniard's\nfeelings. It was enough that they knew of the attack on Don Bernardino,\nand that they had taken from my house whatever was of value in it. As I\nwent over the practical side of the work before us, I had an idea. It\nwas evident that these men had some secret hiding place not far away;\nwhy should it not be an empty house? I made the suggestion to my two\ncompanions, who agreed with me that we should at once make search for\nsuch a place. Accordingly we arranged that one man of the force should\ngo into Ellon, as soon as it was possible to find any one up, and\nanother into Aberdeen to try to find out from various agents what houses\nin the district were at present unoccupied. In the meantime I looked\nover the list of Manses and found that there were two which were open\nfor letting, but had not yet been occupied, Aucheries and Ardiffery. We\ndetermined to visit the latter first, as it was nearer, amid a network\nof cross roads on the high road to Fraserburgh. When we were arranging\nplans of movement, the two trackers who wanted to resume their work said\nthat we might put them down on our way, as the spot they aimed for lay\nin the same direction. We left two men behind; the rest of us kept\ntogether.\n\nAs we drove along in the brake, the trackers showed us how they had\nfollowed the carriage. It brought an agonising hope to me to think that\nwe were actually travelling on the same road as Marjory had gone. I had\na secret conviction that we were going right. Something within me told\nme so. I had in former days--days that now seemed so long ago--when I\nrealised that I had the Second Sight, come to have such confidence in my\nown intuition that now something of the same feeling came back to me as\na reality. Oh! how I longed that the mysterious gift might now be used\non behalf of her I loved. What would I not have given for one such\nglimpse of her in her present situation, as I had before seen of\nLauchlane Macleod, or of the spirits of the Dead from the Skares. But it\nis of the essence of such supernatural power that it will not work to\ncommand, to present need, to the voice of suffering or of prayer; but\nonly in such mysterious way and time as none can predicate. Whilst I\nthought thus, and hoped thus, and prayed with all the intensity of my\npoor breaking heart, I seemed to feel in me something of the mood in\nwhich the previous visions had come. I became lost to all surroundings;\nand it was with surprise that I became conscious that the carriage had\nstopped and that the trackers were getting off. We arranged with them\nthat after our visit to the Manse at Ardiffery we should return for\nthem, or to see how they had got on with their task. They were not\nhopeful of following a two-day-old trail of a carriage on these dusty\nroads.\n\nThe cross road to Ardiffery branched off to our left, and then to the\nleft again; so that when we came near the place, we were still within\neasy distance, as the crow flies, from where we had left our men.\n\nThe Manse at Ardiffery is a lonely spot, close to the church, but quite\naway from the little clachan. The church stands in its own graveyard, in\na hollow surrounded with a wall of considerable dimensions. The garden\nand policies of the house seem as though carved out of the woodland\ngrowth. There is a narrow iron gate, sheer in the roadway, and a\nstraight path up to the front of the house; one arm branches to the\nright in a curved lane-way through fir trees leading to the stable and\nfarm offices at the back of the house. At the gateway was a board with\na printed notice that the house, with grounds, gardens and policies,\nwas to be let until Christmas. The key could be had from, and details\nsupplied by, Mrs. MacFie, merchant at the Ardiffery cross roads. The\nwhole place had a deserted air; weeds were growing everywhere, and,\neven from the roadway, one could see that the windows were fouled from\ndisuse.\n\nAs we drew near, the odd feeling of satisfaction--I can hardly describe\nit more fully--seemed to grow in me. I was not exultant, I was scarcely\nhopeful; but somehow the veil seemed to be lifting from my soul. We left\nthe brake on the road, and went up the little avenue to the front of the\nhouse. For form's sake we knocked, though we knew well that if those we\nsought should be within there would be little chance of their responding\nto our call. We left one man at the door, in case by any chance any one\nshould come; the rest of us took the other way round to the back of the\nhouse. We had got about half way along it, where there was an opening\ninto the fields, when the detective chief who was in front of us held up\nhis hand to stop. I saw at a glance what had struck him.\n\nWhilst the rest of the rough roadway was unkempt and weed-grown, the\ngravel from this on, to the back of the house, had been lately raked.\n\n\"Why?\"\n\nThe only answer to the unspoken query of each of us was that Marjory had\nmade some marks, intentionally or unintentionally--or some one had; and\nthe gang had tried to efface them.\n\nFools! their very effort to obliterate their trace was a help to us.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLVII\n\nTHE DUMB CAN SPEAK\n\n\nThe Secret Service men spread round the house, moving off silently right\nand left, in accordance with the nods of their chief in answer to their\nlooks of query. As they moved, keeping instinctively in shelter from any\npossible view from the house so far as the ground afforded opportunity,\nI could see that each felt that his gun was in its place. They all knew\nthe gang they had to deal with, and they were not going to take any\nchances. MacRae said to me:\n\n\"I'll go and get the key! I know this country better than any of you;\nI can run over to the cross roads in a few minutes and it will be less\nmarked than driving there.\" As he went out at the gate he told the\ndriver to pull down the road, till the curve shut him out of sight.\nWhilst he was gone, the men surrounded the house, keeping guard at such\npoints that nothing coming from it could escape our notice. The chief\ntried the back door but it was shut; from its rigidity it was manifestly\nbolted top and bottom.\n\nIn less than a quarter of an hour MacRae returned and told us that Mrs.\nMacFie was coming with the key as quickly as she could. He offered to\ntake it, telling her who he was; but she said she would come herself and\nmake her service, as it would not be respectful to him and the other\ngentlemen to let them go alone. In a few minutes she was with us; the\nchief detective, Cathcart, and I stayed with MacRae, the rest of the\nmen remaining on watch and hidden. There was a little difficulty with\nthe lock, but we shortly got in, Mrs. MacFie leading the way. Whilst she\nwas opening the shutters of the back room, which was evidently the\nMinister's study, Cathcart and the chief left the room, and made a\nhurried, though thorough, search of the house. They came back before the\nold lady was well through her task, and shook their heads.\n\nWhen the light was let in, the room presented a scene of considerable\ndisorder. It was evident that it had been lately inhabited, for there\nwere scattered about, a good many things which did not belong to it.\nThese included a washing jug, and a bowl full of dirty water; a rug and\npillows on the sofa; and a soiled cup and plate on the table. On the\nmantlepiece was a guttered out candle. When the old woman saw the state\nof the room, she lifted her hands in horrified amazement as she spoke:\n\n\"Keep's 'a! The tramps must ha' been here. In the Meenester's own study,\ntoo! An' turnin' the whole place topsal-teerie. Even his bukes all\njumm'lt up thegither. Ma certes! but won't he be upset by yon!\"\n\nWhilst she had been speaking, my eyes had been taking in everything. All\nalong one side of the room was a bookcase, rough shelves graduated up in\nheight to suit the various sizes of books. There were in the room more\nthan enough books to fill them; but still some of the shelves towards\nthe right hand end were vacant and a great quantity of books lay on the\nfloor. These were not tumbled about as if thrown down recklessly, but\nwere laid upon the floor in even rows. It looked as if they had been\ntaken down in masses and laid out in the same order as though ready to\nput back. But the books on the shelves! It was no wonder that the old\nwoman, who did not understand the full meaning, was shocked; for never\nwas seen such seeming disorder in any library. Seldom did a volume of a\nseries seem to be alongside its fellow; even when several were grouped\ntogether, the rest of the selection would be missing, or seen in another\npart of the shelf. Some of the volumes were upside down; others had\nthe fronts turned out instead of the back. Altogether there was such\ndisorder as I had never seen. And yet!...\n\nAnd yet the whole was planned by a clever and resolute woman, fighting\nfor her life--her honour. Marjory, evidently deprived of any means of\nwriting--there was neither pen nor ink nor pencil in the room--and\nprobably forbidden under hideous threats to leave any message, had yet\nunder the very eyes of her captors left a veritable writing on the wall,\nfull and open for all to read, did they but know how. The arrangement of\nthe books was but another variant of our biliteral cipher. Books as they\nshould be, represented A; all others B. I signed to the man with the\nnotebook, who took down the words wrought in the cipher as I read them\noff. Oh, how my heart beat with fear and love and pride as I realised in\nthe message of my dear girl the inner purpose of her words:\n\n\"To-morrow off north east of Banff _Seagull_ to meet whaler\n_Wilhelmina_. To be Shanghaied--whatever that means. Frightful threats\nto give me to the negro if any trouble, or letters to friends. Don't\nfear, dear, shall die first. Have sure means. God with us. Remember\nthe cave. Just heard Gardent--\" Here the message ended. The shelf was\nempty; and the heap of books, from which she had selected so many\nitems, remained as they had been placed ready to her hand. She had been\ncoerced; or else she feared interruption in her task, and did not want\nto cause suspicion.\n\nCoerced! I felt as though choking!\n\nThere was nothing further to be gained here; so we told the old lady\nthat we should write regarding the rental if we decided to take the\nhouse. When we went back to our wagonette, we picked up our two\ntrackers--there was no use for them now--and went back to Crom as fast\nas the horses could gallop. It was necessary that we should arrange from\nheadquarters our future plans; such maps and papers as we had were at\nCrom, where also any telegrams might await us. In the carriage I asked\nthe detective chief what was meant by 'Shanghaied' for it was evidently\na criminal class word.\n\n\"Don't you know the word,\" he said surprised. \"Why I thought every one\nknew that. It isn't altogether a criminal class word, for it belongs\npartly to a class that call themselves traders. The whalers and others\ndo it when they find it hard to get men; as a rule men nowadays don't\nlike shipping on long whaling voyages. They get such men delivered on\nboard by the crimps, drunk or, more generally, hocussed. Then when they\nget near a port they make them drunk again, which isn't much of a job\nafter all, and they don't make no kick; or if things are serious they\nhocus them a bit again. So they keep them one way or another out of\nsight for months or perhaps years. Sometimes, when those that are not\ntoo particular want to get rid of an inconvenient relative--or mayhap\na witness, or a creditor, or an inconvenient husband--they just square\nsome crimp. When he gets his hooks on the proper party, there ain't no\nmore jamboree for him, except between the bulwarks, till the time is up,\nor the money spent, or whatever he is put away for is fixed as they want\nit.\"\n\nThis was a new and enlightening horror to me. It opened up fresh\npossibilities of distress for both Marjory and myself. As I thought of\nthis, I could not but be grateful to Montgomery for his message to the\nman-of-war's men. If once they succeeded in getting Marjory on board\nthe _Seagull_ we should, in the blindness of our ignorance as to her\nwhereabouts, be powerless to help her. The last word of her message\nthrough the books might be a clue. It was some place, and was east of\nBanff. I got the big map out at once and began to search. Surely enough,\nthere it was. Some seven or eight miles east of Banff was a little port\nin a land-locked bay called Gardentown. At once I sent off a wire to\nAdams at Aberdeen, and another to Montgomery to Peterhead on chance that\nit might reach him even before that which Adams, whom he kept posted as\nto his every movement, would be sure to send to him! It was above all\nthings necessary that we should locate first the _Seagull_ and then the\n_Wilhelmina_. If we could get hold of either vessel we might frustrate\nthe plans of the miscreants. I asked Adams to have the touching of the\n_Wilhelmina_ at any port telegraphed to him at once from Lloyds.\n\nHe was quite awake at his end of the wire; I got back an answer in an\nincredibly short time:\n\n\"_Wilhelmina_ left Lerwick for Arctic seas yesterday.\"\n\nVery shortly afterwards another telegram came from him:\n\n\"Montgomery reports _Seagull_ fishing this summer at Fraserburgh. Went\nout with fleet two days ago.\" Almost immediately after this came a third\ntelegram from him:\n\n\"_Keystone_ notified. Am coming to join you.\"\n\nAfter a consultation we agreed that it was better that some of us\nshould wait at Crom for the arrival of Adams, who had manifestly some\nadditional knowledge. In the meantime we despatched two of the Secret\nService men up to the north of Buchan. One was to go to Fraserburgh, and\nthe other to Banff. Both were to follow the cliffs or the shore to\nGardentown. On their way they would get a personal survey of the coast\nand might pick up some information. MacRae went off himself to send a\ntelegram ordering his yacht, which was at Inverness, to be taken to\nPeterhead, where he would join her. \"It may be handy to have her at the\nmouth of the Firth,\" he said. \"She's a clipper, and if we should want to\noverhaul the _Seagull_ or the _Wilhelmina_, she can easily do it.\"\n\nIt was a long, long wait till Adams arrived. I did not think that a man\ncould endure such misery as I suffered, and live. Every minute, every\nsecond, was filled with some vague terror. _Omne ignotum pro mirifico._\nWhen Fear and Fancy join hands, there is surely woe and pain to some\npoor human soul.\n\nWhen Adams at last arrived he had much to tell; but it was the\namplification of what we had heard, rather than fresh news. The U.\u00c2\u00a0S.\ncruiser _Keystone_ had been reached from Hamburgh, and was now on her\nway to a point outside the three-mile limit off Peterhead; and a private\nwatch had been set on every port and harbour between Wick and Aberdeen.\nThe American Embassy was doing its work quietly as befits such an arm\nof the State; but its eyes and ears were open, and I had no doubts its\npockets, too. Its hand was open now; but it would close, did there be\nneed.\n\nWhen Adams learned our purpose he became elated. He came over to me and\nlaid his hand tenderly on my shoulder as he said:\n\n\"I know how it is with you, old fellow; a man don't want more than two\neyes for that. But there's a many men would give all they have to stand\nin your shoes, for all you suffer. Cheer up! At the worst now it's her\ndeath! For myself I feared at first there might be worse; but it's plain\nto me that Miss Drake is up to everything and ready for everything. My!\nbut she's a noble girl! If anything goes wrong with her there's going to\nbe some scrapping round before the thing's evened up!\" He then went on\nto tell me that Montgomery would be joined at Peterhead by two other\nnaval fellows who were qualified in all ways to do whatever might be\nrequired. \"Those boys won't stop at much, I can tell you,\" he said.\n\"They're full of sand, the lot; and I guess that when this thing is\nover, it won't harm them at Washington to know that they've done men's\nwork of one kind or another.\"\n\nIt was comfort to me to hear him talk. Sam Adams knew what he meant,\nwhen he wanted to help a friend; thinking it all over I don't see what\nbetter he could have said to me--things being as they were. He went back\nto Aberdeen to look out for news or instructions, but was to join us\nlater at Banff.\n\nWe left two men at Crom; one to be always on the spot, and the other to\nbe free to move about and send telegrams, etc. Then the rest of us drove\nover to Fyvie and caught the train to Macduff.\n\nWhen we arrived we sent one man in the hotel in Banff in case we should\nwant to communicate, and the rest of us drove over in a carriage to\nGardentown. It is a lovely coast, this between Banff and Gardentown, but\nwe should have preferred it to be less picturesque and more easy to\nwatch.\n\nWhen our man met us, which he did with exceeding caution, he at once\nbegan:\n\n\"They've got off, some of them; but I think the rest of the gang's\nashore still. That's why I'm so particular; they may be watchin' us now\nfor all I can tell.\" Then he proceeded to give us all the information he\nhad gleaned.\n\n\"The _Seagull_ was here until yesterday when she went out into the\nFirth to run down to Fifeshire, as the fish were reported going south.\nShe had more than her complement of men, and her skipper volunteered the\ninformation that two of them were friends whom they were taking to join\ntheir own boat which was waiting for them at Burnt Island. From all\naccounts I gather,\" he went on, \"that they wasn't anything extra\nhigh-toned. Most of them were drunk or getting a jag on them; and it\ntook the two sober ones and the Skipper to keep them in order. The\nSkipper was mighty angry; he seemed somehow ashamed of them, and hurried\nout of port as quick as he could when he made his mind up. They say he\nswore at them frightful; though that was not to be wondered at when\nhe himself had to help bring the nets on board. One of the men on the\nquay told me that he said if that was the effect on his men of waiting\nround for weeks doing nothing, he would see that another time their\ndouble-dashed noses were kept to the grindstone. I've been thinking\nsince I heard of the trouble they had in carrying on the nets, that\nthere was something under them that they meant to hide. The men here\ntell me that the hand-barrow they carried would have been a job for six\nmen, not three, for it was piled shoulder high with nets. That's why\nthe skipper was so wrathy with them. They say he's a sort of giant,\na Dutchman with an evil, cunning face; and that all the time he was\ncarrying the back handles he never stopped swearing at the two in front,\nthough they was nigh speechless with the effort of carrying, and their\nfaces as red as blazes. If I'm right we've missed them this time.\nThey've got the girl on the fishing boat; and they're off for the\nwhaler. She's the one we'll have to find next!\"\n\nAs he spoke my heart kept sinking deeper and deeper down. My poor\ngirl, if alive, was in the hands of her enemies. In all the thoughts\nwhich filled me with anguish unspeakable there was but one gleam of\nconsolation--the negro was not on board, too. I had come to think of\nthis miscreant as in some way the active principle of whatever evil\nmight be.\n\nHere, we were again at a fault in our pursuit. We must wait for the\nreports of Montgomery who was making local inquiries. We had wired him\nto join us, or send us word to Gardentown; and he had replied that he\nwas on the way.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLVIII\n\nDUNBUY HAVEN\n\n\nWe had to-day been so hot in the immediate pursuit of Marjory that we\nhad hardly been able to think of the other branches of our work; but all\nat once, the turn of the wheel brought up as the most important matter\nbefore us what had been up to now only a collateral. Hitherto the\n_Seagull_ had been our objective; but now it must be the _Wilhelmina_.\nAdams had been in charge of the general investigation as to these boats,\nwhilst Montgomery had been attending to local matters. It was to the\nformer, therefore, rather than the latter, that we had to look for\nenlightenment. Montgomery and MacRae were the first to arrive, coming on\nhorseback from Fraserburgh, the former with all the elan and abandonment\nof a sailor ashore. He was frightfully chagrined when he heard that the\n_Seagull_ had got safely away. \"Just like my luck!\" he said, \"I might\nhave got her in time if I had known enough; but I never even heard of\nGardentown till your wire came to me. It isn't on the map.\" He was still\nfull of lamentings, though I could tell from the way he was all nerved\nand braced up that we should hear of him when the time for action came.\nWhen we arrived at the station at Macduff to meet Adams, we hurried him\nat once into the carriage which we had waiting; he gave us his news as\nwe hurried off to Gardentown. We felt that it might be a mistake our\ngoing there, for we should be out of the way of everything; but we had\nmade arrangements for news to be sent there, and it was necessary we\nshould go there before holding our council of war. Adams told us that\nthe whaler _Wilhelmina_ had been reported at Lerwick two days ago, but\nthat she had suddenly left on receipt of a telegram, hurrying in the\nlast of her stores at such a rate that some of them had been actually\nleft behind. He had not been able to gain any specific information by\nwire. The Master of the ship had said to the Harbour Master that he was\ngoing to Nova Zembla; but nothing more definite could be obtained.\n\nWhen we got together in the hotel at Gardentown we were surprised by\nanother arrival; none other than Don Bernardino, who had come by the\nsame train as Adams, but had had to wait to get a carriage. We had got\naway so quickly that none of us had seen him.\n\nThings were now at such a stage that it would not do to have any\nconcealment whatever; and so after a moment in private with the Don, I\ntold my companions of the attack on the Spaniard in my house, and of the\ncarrying off the great treasure. I did not give any details of the\ntreasure or its purpose; nor did I even mention the trust. This was now\nthe Don's secret, and there was no need to mention it. We all agreed\nthat if we should have any chance at all of finding Marjory, it would be\nby finding and following the members of the gang left on shore. Sam\nAdams who was, next to the Secret Service men, the coolest-headed of our\nparty, summed up the situation.\n\n\"Those fellows haven't got off yet. It is evident that they only came to\nlook for the treasure after Miss Drake had been shipped off from\nGardentown. And I'm pretty sure that they are waiting somewhere round\nthe coast for the _Wilhelmina_ to pick them up; or for them to get\naboard her somehow. They've got a cartload of stuff at the very least to\nget away; and you may bet your sweet life that they don't mean to leave\nit to chance. Moreover, you can't lay your hand at any minute on a\nwhaler ready for shanghaieing any one. This one has been fixed up on\npurpose, and was waiting up at Lerwick for a long time ready to go when\ntold. I think myself that it's more than likely she has orders to take\nthem off herself, for a fishing smack like the _Seagull_ that has to be\nin and out of these ports all the time, doesn't want to multiply the\nchances of her discovery. Now that she has done a criminal thing and is\npretty sure that it can't be proved against her, she'll take her share\nof the swag, or whatever was promised her, and clear out. If the\n_Wilhelmina_ has to get off the gang it'll have to be somewhere off this\ncoast. They are nearly all strangers to start with, and wouldn't know\nwhere else to go. If they go south they get at once into more thickly\npeopled shores, where the chances of getting off in secret would be\nless. They daren't go anywhere along the shore of the Firth, for their\nship might be cut off at the mouth, and they might be taken within the\nthree-mile limit and searched. Beyond the Firth they can know nothing.\nTherefore, we have got to hunt them along this shore; and from the lie\nof the land I should say that they will try to get off somewhere between\nOld Slains and Peterhead. And I'll say further that, in-as-much-as the\nshore dips in between Whinnyfold and Girdleness outside Aberdeen, the\nship will prefer to keep up the north side, so that she can beat out to\nsea at once, when she has got her cargo aboard.\"\n\n\"Sam is about right!\" broke in Montgomery \"I have been all along the\ncoast since we met, surveying the ground for just this purpose. I tried\nto put myself in the place of that crowd, and to find a place just such\nas they would wish. They could get out at Peterhead or at Boddam, and so\nI have set a watch at these places. Some of our sailors who were sent\nup to me from London are there now, and I'll stake my word that if the\n_Wilhelmina_ tries to come in to either of these places she won't get\nout again with Marjory Drake on board. But it's not their game to come\nnear a port. They've got to lie off shore, somewhere agreed on, and take\noff their friends in a boat. There are dozens of places between Cruden\nand Peterhead where a boat could lie hidden, and slip out safely enough.\nWhen they got aboard they could hoist in the boat or scuttle her; and\nthen, up sails and off before any one was the wiser. What I propose,\ntherefore, is this, for I take it I'm the naval expert here such as it\nis. We must set a watch along this bit of coast, so as to be ready to\njump on them when they start out. We can get the _Keystone_ to lie off\nBuchan; and we can signal her when we get sign of our lot. She'll be\nwell on the outside, and these scallywags don't know that she'll be\nthere to watch them. When the time comes, she'll crowd them into shore;\nand we'll be ready for them there. If she can hunt the _Wilhelmina_ into\nthe Firth it will be easy enough to get her. \"Fighting Dick\" Morgan\nisn't a man to stand on ceremony; and you can bet your bottom dollar\nthat if he gets a sight of the Dutchman he'll pretty well see that she\nhasn't any citizen of the United States aboard against her will. Dick\nwouldn't mind the people in Washington much, and he'd take on the Dutch\nto-morrow as well as the Spaniards. Now, if in addition this gentleman's\nyacht is to the fore, with any one of us here aboard to take\nresponsibility, I guess we can overhaul the whaler without losing time.\"\n\n\"I'll be aboard!\" said Donald MacRae quietly. \"The _Sporran_ is due at\nPeterhead this afternoon. Just you fit me up with signals so that we'll\nknow what to do when we get word; and I'll see to the rest. My men are\nof my own clan, and I'll answer for them. They'll not hang back in\nanything, when I'm in the front of them.\"\n\nI wrung the hands of the two young fellows. East and West, it was all\nthe same! The old fighting gallantry was in their hearts; and with the\ninstinct of born Captains they were ready to accept all responsibility.\nAll they asked was that their men should follow them.\n\nThey immediately sat down to arrange their signals. Montgomery was of\ncourse trained in this work, and easily fixed up a simple scheme by\nwhich certain orders could be given by either flags, or lights, or\nrockets. There was not need for much complication; it was understood\nthat when the _Wilhelmina_ should be sighted she should be boarded at\nonce, wherever or however she might be. We were, one and all of us,\nprepared to set at defiance every law--international, maritime, national\nor local. Under the circumstances we felt that, given we could once get\non track with our enemy, we held a great power in our hands.\n\nBefore long, MacRae was off to Peterhead to join his yacht, which would\nat once start on a sort of sentry-go up and down the coast. The rest of\nus set about arranging to spread ourselves along the shore between\nCruden and Peterhead. We did not arrange watches, for time was now\nprecious to all, on both sides of the encounter. If an attempt was to\nbe made to take off the treasure, it would in all probability be made\nbefore morning; every hour that passed multiplied the difficulties and\ndangers of the blackmailers. The weather was becoming misty, which was\na source of inconvenience to us all. Thick patches of white fog began\nto drift in from the north east, and there was ominous promise in the\nrising wind of there being danger on sea and shore before many hours had\npassed. We each took provision with us for the night, and a sufficiency\nof rockets and white and red lights for our signalling work, in case\nthere might be need of such.\n\nIn disposing of our forces, we had not of course a sufficiency of men to\nform a regular cordon; but we so arranged ourselves that there was no\npoint at which a boat could land which was not in view of some of us. I\nwas terribly anxious, for as the evening came on, the patches of white\nmist came driving in more quickly, and getting thicker and more dense.\nBetween them the sea was clear, and there was no difficulty in keeping\naccurate observation; but as each fog belt came down on the rising wind\nour hearts fell. It would come on like a white cloud, which would seem\nto strike the land and then close in on every side, as though wrapping\nthe shore in a winding sheet. My own section for watching was between\nSlains Castle and Dunbuy, as wild and rocky a bit of coast as any one\ncould wish to see. Behind Slains runs in a long narrow inlet with\nbeetling cliffs, sheer on either side, and at its entrance a wild\nturmoil of rocks are hurled together in titanic confusion. From this\npoint northward, the cliffs are sheer, to where the inlet of Dunbuy has\nits entrance guarded by the great rock, with its myriad of screaming\nwildfowl and the white crags marking their habitation. Midway between\nthose parts of my sentry-go is a spot which I could not but think would\nbe eminently suited for their purpose, and on this for some time I\ncentred my attention. It is a place where in old days the smugglers\nmanaged to get in many a cargo safe, almost within earshot of the\ncoastguards. The _modus operandi_ was simple. On a dark night when\nit was known that the coastguards were, intentionally or by chance,\nelsewhere, a train of carts would gather quickly along the soft grass\ntracks, or through the headlands of the fields. A crane was easily\nimprovised of two crossed poles, with a longer one to rest on them; one\nend held inland, could be pushed forward or drawn back, so as to make\nthe other end hang over the water or fall back over the inner edge of\nthe cliff. A pulley at the end of this pole, and a long rope with its\nshore end attached to the harness of a strong horse completed the\nequipment. Then, when the smugglers had come under the cliff, the rope\nwas lowered and the load attached; the waiting horse was galloped\ninland, and in a few seconds the cluster of barrels or cases was swung\nup on the cliff and distributed amongst the waiting carts.\n\nIt would be an easy matter to invert the process. If all were ready--and\nI knew that the gang were too expert to have any failing in that\nrespect--a few minutes would suffice to place the whole of the treasure\nin a waiting boat. The men, all save one, could be lowered the same way,\nand the last man could be let down by the rope held from below. I knew\nthat the blackmailers had possession of at least one cart; in any case,\nto men so desperate and reckless to get temporary possession of a few\ncarts in a farming country like this would be no difficult task. So I\ndetermined to watch this spot with extra care. It was pretty bare at\ntop; but there was a low wall of stone and clay, one of those rough\nfences which are so often seen round cliff fields. I squatted down\nbehind a corner of this wall, from which I could see almost the whole\nstretch of my division. No boat could get into Dunbuy or Lang Haven, or\nclose to the Castle rocks without my seeing it; the cliff from there up\nto where I was was sheer, and I could see well into the southern passage\nof the Haven inside Dunbuy Rock. Sometimes when the blanket of fog\nspread over the sea, I could hear the trumpeting of some steamer far\nout; and when the fog would lift, I would see her funnels spouting black\nsmoke in her efforts to clear so dangerous a coast. Sometimes a fishing\nboat on its way up or down would run in shore, close hauled; or a big\nsailing vessel would move onward with that imperceptible slowness which\nmarks the progress of a ship far out at sea. When any fishing boat came\nalong, my heart beat as I scanned her with the field glass which I had\nbrought with me. I was always hoping that the _Seagull_ would appear,\nthough why I know not, for there was now little chance indeed that\nMarjory would be on board her.\n\nAfter a spell of waiting, which seemed endless and unendurable, in one\nof the spells of mist I thought I saw on the cliff a woman, taking\nshelter of every obstacle, as does one who is watching another. At that\nmoment the mist was thick; but when it began to thin, and to stream away\nbefore the wind in trails like smoke, I saw that it was Gormala. Somehow\nthe sight of her made my heart beat wildly. She had been a factor of so\nmany strange incidents in my life of late years--incidents which seemed\nto have some connection or fatal sequence--that her presence seemed to\nforetell something fresh, and to have some kind of special significance.\nI crouched still lower behind the corner of the wall, and watched with\nenhanced eagerness. A very short study of her movements showed me that\nshe was not watching any specific individual. She was searching for some\none, or some thing; and was in terror of being seen, rather than of\nmissing the object of her search. She would peer carefully over the edge\nof the cliff, lying down on her face to do so, and putting her head\nforward with the most elaborate care. Then, when she had satisfied\nherself that what she sought was not within sight, she would pass on\na little further and begin her survey over again. Her attitude during\nthe prevalence of a mist was so instructive, that I found myself\nunconsciously imitating her. She would remain as still as if turned to\nstone, with one ear to windward, listening with sharp, preternatural\nintentness. I wondered at first that I could not hear the things that\nshe manifestly did, for the expression of her face was full of changes.\nWhen, however, I remembered that she was born and reared amongst the\nislands, and with fisher folk and sea folk of all kinds whose weather\ninstincts are keener than is given to the inland born, her power was no\nlonger a mystery. How I longed at that moment to have something of her\nskill! And then came the thought that she had long ago offered to place\nthat very power at my disposal; and that I might still gain her help.\nEvery instant, as past things crowded back to my memory, did that help\nseem more desirable. Was it not her whom I had seen watching Don\nBernardino when he left my house; mayhap she had guided him to it. Or\nmight it not have been Gormala who had brought the blackmailers to my\ndoor. If she had no knowledge of them, what was she doing here now? Why\nhad she sought this place of all places; why at this time of all times?\nWhat or whom was she seeking amongst the cliffs?\n\nI determined not to lose sight of her at present, no matter what might\nhappen; later, when I had come at her purpose, either by guessing or\nby observation, I could try to gain her services. Though she had been\nenraged with me, I was still to her a Seer; and she believed--must\nbelieve from what had passed--that I could read for her the Mystery of\nthe Sea.\n\nAs she worked along the cliff above Dunbuy Haven, where the rock\noverhung the water, she seemed to increase both her interest and her\ncaution. I followed round the rude wall which ran parallel to the cliff,\nso that I might be as near to her as possible.\n\nDunbuy Haven is a deep cleft in the granite rock in the shape of a Y,\nthe arms of which run seawards and are formed by the mother cliff on\neither hand and the lofty crags of the island of Dunbuy. In both these\narms there is deep water; but when there is a sea on, or when the wind\nblows strong, they are supremely dangerous. Even the scour of the tide\nrunning up or down makes a current difficult to stem. In fair weather,\nhowever, it is fairly good for boating; though the swell outside may be\ntrying to those who are poor sailors. I had often tossed on that swell\nwhen I had been out with the salmon fishers, when they had been drawing\ntheir deep floating nets.\n\nPresently I saw Gormala bend, and then disappear out of sight. She had\npassed over the edge of the cliff. I went cautiously after her, and\nthrowing myself on my face so that she could not see me, peered over.\n\nThere was a sort of sheep track along the face of the cliff, leading\ndownward in a zigzag. It was so steep, and showed so little foothold,\nthat even in the state of super-excitement in which I then was, it made\nme dizzy to look at it. But the old woman, trained on the crags of the\nwestern islands, passed along it as though it were the broad walk of a\nterraced garden.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIX\n\nGORMALA'S LAST HELP\n\n\nAfter Gormala had disappeared down the zigzag under the rock, where I\ncould no longer see her movements, I waited for her return. At the end\nof the Haven, where the little beach runs up to the edge of the cliff,\nthere is a steep path. Even this is so steep that it is impracticable to\nordinary persons; only fisher folk, dalesmen and hunters can use such\nways. For myself I dare not leave my post; from the end of the Haven I\ncould not see any part at all of the coast I had come to watch, except\nthe narrow spot between great cliffs where the channels ran right and\nleft of the Rock of Dunbuy. So I crept back to my hiding place behind\nthe angle of the wall, from which I could watch the entrance to the\ntrack down which she had passed.\n\nTime wore away slowly, slowly; and the mist kept coming in more frequent\nbelts, heavier and more dank. After the sunset the fog seemed to come\nmore heavily still, so that the promise of the night was darkness\ninvincible. In Aberdeen, however, the twilight is long, and under\nordinary conditions it is easy to see for hours after sunset. All at\nonce, after the passing of a belt of mist, I was startled by a voice\nbehind me:\n\n\"And for what is it ye watch, the nicht? Is it the Mystery o' the Sea\nthat holds ye to the dyke; or maybe it is the treasure that ye seek!\"\nGormala had evidently come up the path at the end of the Haven. For a\nwhile I did not say a word, but thought the matter over. Now, if ever,\nwas there need to use my wits, and I could best deal with Gormala if I\nshould know something of her own wishes beforehand; so I tried to master\nher purpose and her difficulties. Firstly, she must have been in search\nof some hiding place herself, or she would not have come behind the\nwall; I was quite sure that she had not known of my presence before she\nwent down the sheep track. If she wanted cover, what then was it she was\nwatching? She had been down to the beach of the Haven, and so must have\nknown whether or no it was bare of interest. As she was choosing a\ncorner whence she could watch the track, it was at least likely that she\nexpected some one to go up or down by it. If she were looking for some\none to go down, she would surely rather watch its approaches than the\nplace itself. It was, therefore, for some one to come up for whom she\nwished to watch. As, instead of hurrying away or hiding herself from me\nwhen she had seen me without my seeing her, she had deliberately engaged\nwith me in conversation, it was evident that she did not expect whomever\nshe watched for to come up at once. In fine I concluded, she intended to\nwatch for some one who _might_ come; with this knowledge I drew a bow at\na venture:\n\n\"So your friend isn't coming up yet? Why didn't you fix matters when\nyou were down below?\" For an instant she was betrayed into showing\nastonishment; the surprise was in both her expression and in the tones\nof her voice as she replied:\n\n\"How kent ye that I was doon the Haven?\" Then she saw her mistake and\nwent on with a scowl:\n\n\"Verra clever ye are wi' yer guesses; and a daft aud wife am I to no ken\nye better? Why did----\"\n\n\"Did you find him down below?\" even whilst I was speaking the\nconviction came to me--I scarcely know how, but it was there as though\ndeep-rooted in my brain all my life--that our enemies were down below,\nor that they had some hiding place there. Gormala must have seen the\nchange in my face, for she exclaimed with jubilation:\n\n\"It would hae been better for ye that ye had taken my sairvice. The een\nthat watched others micht hae been watchin' to yer will. But it's a'\nower the noo. What secret there was is yours nae mair; an' it may be\nwaur for ye that ye flouted me in the days gone.\" As she spoke, the\nbitterness of her manner was beyond belief; the past rushed back on me\nso fiercely that I groaned. Then came again, but with oh! what pain, the\nthought of my dear one in the hands of her enemies.\n\nLet no man question the working of the Almighty's hand. In that moment\nof the ecstasy of pain, something had spoken to the heart of the old\nwoman beside me; for when I came back to myself they were different\neyes which looked into mine. They were soft and full of pity. All the\nmotherhood which ever had been, or might have been, in that lonely soul\nwas full awake. It was with a tender voice that she questioned me:\n\n\"Ye are muckle sad laddie. Do I no ken a look like that when I speer it,\nand know that the Fates are to their wark. What maks ye greet laddie;\nwhat maks ye greet?\" for by this time the revulsion of tenderness had\nbeen too much for me and I was openly weeping. \"Is it that the lassie\nis gone frae ye? Weel I ken that nane but a lassie can mak a strong man\ngreet.\" I felt that the woman's heart was open to me; and spoke with all\nthe passion of my soul:\n\n\"Oh, Gormala help me! Perhaps you can, and it may not be too late. She\nis stolen away and is in the hands of her enemies; wicked and desperate\nmen who have her prisoner on a ship somewhere out at sea. Her life, her\nhonour are at stake. Help me if you can; and I will bless you till the\nlast hour of my life!\" The old woman's face actually blazed as I spoke.\nShe seemed to tower up in the full of her gaunt height to the stature of\nher woman's pride, as with blazing eyes she answered me:\n\n\"What! a woman, a lassie, in the hands o' wicked men! Aye an' sic a\nbonnie, gran' lassie as yon, though she did flout me in the pride of her\nyouth and strength. Laddie, I'm wi' ye in all ye can dae! Wi' a' the\nstrength o' my hairt an' the breath o' my body; for life or for death!\nNe'er mind the past; bad or good for me it is ower; and frae this oot\nI'm to your wark. Tell me what I can dae, an' the grass'll no grow under\nmy feet. A bonnie bit lassie in the power o' wicked men! I may hae been\nower eager to win yer secret; but I'm no that bad to let aught sic come\nbetween me and the duty to what is pure and good!\" She seemed grand and\nnoble in her self-surrender; such a figure as the poets of the old sagas\nmay have seen in their dreams, when the type of noble old womanhood was\nin their hearts; in the times when the northern nations were dawning. I\nwas quite overcome; I could not speak. I took her hand and kissed it.\nThis seemed to touch her to the quick; with a queer little cry she\ngasped out:\n\n\"Oh, laddie, laddie!\" and said no more. Then I told her of how Marjory\nhad been carried off by the blackmail gang; I felt that she was entitled\nto this confidence. When I had spoken, she beat with her shut hand on\nthe top of the wall and said in a smothered way:\n\n\"Och! if I had but kent; if I had but kent! To think that I might\nhae been watchin' them instead o' speerin' round yon hoose o' yours,\nwatchin' to wring yer secret frae ye, an' aidin' yer enemies in their\nwark. First the outland man wi' the dark hair; an' then them along wi'\nthe black man wi' the evil face that sought ye the nicht gone. Wae is\nme! Wae is me! that I ha' done harm to a' in the frenzy o' my lust, and\ngreed, and curiosity!\" She took on so badly that I tried to comfort her.\nI succeeded to a measure, when I had pointed out that the carrying off\nof Marjory was altogether a different matter from what had gone on in my\nhouse. Suddenly she stopped rocking herself to and fro; holding up one\nlong gaunt arm as I had seen her do several times before, she said:\n\n\"But what matters it after a'! We're in the hands o' Fate! An' there are\nVoices that speak an' Een that see. What is ordered of old will be done\nfor true; no matter how we may try to work our own will. 'Tis little use\nto kick against the pricks.\"\n\nThen all at once she became brisk and alert. In a most practical tone of\nvoice she said:\n\n\"Noo tell me what I can dae! Weel I ken, that ye hae a plan o' yer ain;\nan' that you and ithers are warkin' to an end that ye hae set. Ye hae\none ither wi' ye the nicht; for gude or ill.\" She paused, and I asked\nher:\n\n\"Why did you go down the sheep path to the Haven. For what or for whom\nwere you looking?\"\n\n\"I was lookin' for the treasure that I suspect was ta'en frae your\nhoose; an' for them that took it! 'Twas I that guided them, after the\ndark man had gone; and watched whiles they were within. Then they sent\nme on a lang errand away to Ellon; and when I got back there was nane\nthere. I speered close, and saw the marks o' a cairt heavy loaden. It\nwas lost on the high road; an' since then, nicht an' day hae I sought\nfor any trace; but all in vain. But I'm thinkin' that it's nigh to here\nthey've hid it; I went down the yowes' roadie, an' alang the rock, an'\nup the bit beach; but never a sign did I see. There's a many corners\naboot the crags here, where a muckle treasure might lie hid, an' nane\nthe wiser save them that pit it there!\" Whilst she was talking I was\nscribbling a line in my pocket-book; I tore out the page and handed it\nto her:\n\n\"If you would help me take that letter for I must not leave here. Give\nit to the dark gentleman whom you know by sight. He is somewhere on the\nrocks beyond the Castle.\" My message was to tell Don Bernardino that I\nbelieved the treasure was hidden somewhere near me, and that the bearer\nof the note would guide him if he thought wise to join me.\n\nThen I waited, waited. The night grew darker and darker; and the fog\nbelts came so thick and so heavy that they almost became one endless\nmass. Only now and again could I get a glimpse of the sea outside the\ngreat rock. Once, far off out at sea but floating in on the wind, I\nheard eight bells sound from a ship. My heart beat at the thought; for\nif the _Keystone_ were close at hand it might be well for us later on.\nThen there was silence, long and continuous. A silence which was of\nthe night alone; every now and again when some sound of life from near\nor far came to break its monotony the reaction became so marked that\nsilence seemed to be a positive quality.\n\nAll at once I became conscious that Gormala was somewhere near me. I\ncould not see her, I could not hear her; but it was no surprise to me\nwhen through the darkness I saw her coming close to me, followed by Don\nBernardino. They both looked colossal through the mist.\n\nAs quickly as I could, I told the Don of my suspicions; and asked his\nadvice. He agreed with me as to the probabilities of the attempt to\nescape, and announced his willingness to go down the path to Dunbuy\nHaven and explore it thoroughly so far as was possible. Accordingly,\nwith Gormala to guide him, he went to the end of the Haven and descended\nthe steep moraine--it was a declension rather than a path. For myself I\nwas not sanguine as to a search. The night was now well on us, and even\nhad the weather been clear it would have been a difficult task to make\nsearch in such a place, where the high cliffs all around shut out the\npossibilities of side light. Moreover, along the Haven, as with other\nsuch openings on this iron-bound coast, there were patches of outlying\nrock under the cliffs. Occasionally these were continuous, so that at\nthe proper state of the tide a fairly good climber could easily make way\nalong them. Here, however, there was no such continuity; the rocks\nrising from the sea close under the cliffs were in patches; without a\nboat it would be useless to attempt a complete exploration. I waited,\nhowever, calmly; I was gaining patience now out of my pain. A good while\nelapsed before the Don returned, still accompanied by Gormala. He told\nme that only the beach had been possible for examination; but as far as\nhe could see out by either channel, there was no sign of anyone hiding,\nor any bulk which could be such as we sought.\n\nHe considered it might be advisable if he went to warn the rest of our\nparty of our belief as to the place appointed, and so took his way up\nnorth. Gormala remained with me so as to be ready to take any message if\noccasion required. She looked tired, so tired and weary that I made her\nlie down behind the rough wall. For myself sleep was an impossibility; I\ncould not have slept had my life or sanity depended on it. To soothe,\nher and put her mind at rest, I told her what she had always wanted to\nknow; what I had seen that night at Whinnyfold when the Dead came up\nfrom the sea. That quieted her, and she soon slept. So I waited and\nwaited, and the time crept slowly away.\n\nAll at once Gormala sat up beside me, broad awake and with all her\ninstincts at her keenest. \"Whish!\" she said, raising a warning hand. At\nthis moment the fog belt was upon us, and on the wind, now risen high,\nthe white wreaths swept by like ghosts. She held her ear as before\ntowards seaward and listened intently. This time there could be no\nmistake; from far off through the dampness of the fog came the sound of\na passing ship. I ran out from behind the wall and threw myself face\ndown at the top of the cliff. I was just at the angle of the opening of\nthe Haven and I could see if a boat entered by either channel. Gormala\ncame beside me and peered over; then she whispered:\n\n\"I shall gang doon the yowes' roadie; it brings me to the Haven's mooth,\nand frae thence I can warn ye if there be aught!\" Before I replied she\nhad flitted away, and I saw her pass over the edge of the cliff and\nproceed on her perilous way. I leaned over the edge of the cliff\nlistening. Down below I heard now and again the sound of a falling\npebble, dislodged from the path, but I could see nothing whatever. Below\nme the black water showed now and again in the lifting of the fog.\n\nThe track outwards leads down to the sea at the southern corner of the\nopening of the Haven; so I moved on here to see if I could get any\nglimpse of Gormala. The fog was now on in a dense mass, and I could see\nnothing a couple of feet from me. I heard, however, a sort of scramble;\nthe rush and roll of stones tumbling, and the hollow reverberating\nplash as they struck the water. My heart jumped, for I feared that some\naccident might have happened to Gormala. I listened intently; but heard\nno sound. I did not stay, however, for I knew that the whole effort of\nthe woman, engaged on such a task, would be to avoid betraying herself.\nI was right in my surmise, for after a few minutes of waiting I heard a\nvery faint groan. It was low and suppressed, but there was no mistaking\nit as it came up to me through the driving mist. It was evident that\nGormala was in some way in peril, and common humanity demanded that I\nshould go down to help her if I could. It was no use my attempting the\nsheep track; if she had failed on it there would not be much chance of\nmy succeeding. Besides, there had been a manifest slip or landslide; and\nmore than probably the path, or some necessary portion of it, had been\ncarried away. It would have been madness to attempt it, so I went to the\nsouthern side of the cliff where the rock was broken, and where there\nwas a sort of rugged path down to the sea. There was also an advantage\nabout this way; I could see straight out to sea to the south of Dunbuy\nRock. Thus I need not lose sight of any shore-coming boat; which might\nhappen were I on the other path which opened only in the Haven.\n\nIt was a hard task, and by daylight I might have found it even more\ndifficult. In parts it actually overhung the water, with an effect of\ndizziness which was in itself dangerous. However, I persevered; and\npresently got down on the cluster of rocks overhung by the cliff. Here,\nat the very corner of the opening to the Haven, under the spot where the\nsheep track led down, I found Gormala almost unconscious. She revived a\nlittle when I lifted her and put my flask to her lips. For a few seconds\nshe leaned gasping against my breast with her poor, thin, grey hair\nstraggling across it. Then, with a great effort, she moaned out feebly,\nbut of intention keeping her voice low lest even in that lone spot amid\nthe darkness of the night and the mist there might be listeners:\n\n\"I'm done this time, laddie; the rocks have broke me when the roadie gav\nway. Listen tae me, I'm aboot to dee; a' the Secrets and the Mysteries\n'll be mine soon. When the end is comin' haud baith my hands in ane o'\nyours, an' keep the ither ower my een. Then, when I'm passin' ye shall\nsee what my dead eyes see; and hear wi' the power o' my dead ears.\nMayhap too, laddie, ye may ken the secrets and the wishes o' my hairt.\nDinna lose yer chance, laddie! God be wi' ye an' the bonny lass. Tell\nher, an' ye will, that I forgie her floutin' me; an' that I bade the\ngude God keep her frae all harm, and send peace and happiness to ye\nboth--till the end. God forgie me all my sins!\"\n\nAs she was speaking her life seemed slowly ebbing away. I could feel it,\nand I knew it in many ways. As I took her hand in mine, a glad smile was\non her face, together with a look of eager curiosity. This was the last\nthing I saw in the dim light, as my hand covered her filming eyes.\n\nAnd then a strange and terrible thing began to happen.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER L\n\nTHE EYES OF THE DEAD\n\n\nAs I knelt with the dead woman's hands in one of mine and the other over\nher eyes, I seemed to be floating high up in the air; and with amazing\nvision to see all round for a great distance. The fog still hung thick\nover the water. Around, the vast of the air and the depths of the sea\nwere as open as though sunshine was on them and I was merely looking\nthrough bright water. In the general panorama of things, so far as the\neye could range, all lay open. The ships on the sea, and the floor under\nit; the iron-bound coast, and the far-lying uplands were all as though\nmarked on a picture chart. Far away on the horizon were several craft,\nsmall and large. A few miles out was a ship of war; and to the north of\nher but much closer in shore lay a graceful yacht, slowly moving with\nthe tide and under shortened sail. The war ship was all alert; on every\ntop, and wherever there was a chance of seeing anything, was the head of\na man on the look-out. The search-light was on, and sea and sky were lit\nalternately with its revolving rays. But that which drew my eyes, as\nthe magnet draws the iron, was a clumsily rigged ship close in shore,\nseemingly only a few hundred yards beyond the Dunbuy Rock. She was a\nwhaler I knew, for on her deck were the great boats for use in rough\nseas, and the furnace where the blubber was melted. With unconscious\nmovement, as though my soul were winged as a bird, I hung poised over\nthis vessel. It was strange indeed, but she seemed all as though\ncomposed of crystal; I could see through her, and down into the deep\nbelow her where her shadow lay, till my eyes rested on the patches of\nbare sand or the masses of giant seaweed which swayed with the tide\nabove the rocks on which it grew. In and out amongst the seaweed the\nfishes darted, and the flower-like limpets moved ceaselessly outside\ntheir shells on the rocks. I could even see the streaks on the water\nwhich wind and current invariably leave on their course. Within the\nship, all was clear as though I were looking into a child's toy-house;\nbut a toy-house wrought of glass. Every nook and cranny was laid bare;\nand the details, even when they did not interest me, sank into my mind.\nI could evermore, by closing my eyes, have seen again anything on which\nin those moments of spiritual vision the eyes of my soul had rested.\n\nAll the time there was to me a dual consciousness. Whatever I saw before\nme was all plain and real; and yet I never lost for a moment the sense\nof my own identity. I knew I was on shore amid the rocks under the\ncliff, and that Gormala's dead body was beside me as I knelt. But there\nwas some divine guiding principle which directed my thought--it must\nhave been my thought, for my eyes followed as my wishes led, as though\nmy whole being went too. They were guided from the very bow of the ship\nalong the deck, and down the after hatchway. I went down, step by step,\nmaking accurate and careful scrutiny of all things around me. I passed\ninto the narrow cabin, which seemed even to me to smell evilly. The rank\nyellow light from the crude oil lamp with thick smoky wick made the\ngloom seem a reality, and the shadows as monstrous. From this I passed\naft into a tiny cabin, where on a bunk lay Marjory asleep. She looked\npale and wan; it made my heart sick to see the great black circles round\nher eyes. But there was resolution in her mouth and nostrils; resolution\nfixed and untameable. Knowing her as I did, and with her message \"I can\ndie\" burned into my heart, it did not need any guessing to know what was\nin the hand clenched inside the breast of her dress. The cabin door was\nlocked; on the outside was a rough bolt, newly placed; the key was not\nin the lock. I would have lingered, for the lightning-like glimpse made\nme hungry for more; but the same compelling force moved me on. In the\nnext cabin lay a man, also asleep. He was large of frame, with a rugged\nred beard streaked with grey; what hair remained on his head, which was\nall scarred with cicatrices, was a dull red turning white. On a rack\nabove him, under the chronometer--which marked Greenwich time as\n2.15,--ready to his hand, were two great seven shooters; from his pocket\npeeped the hilt of a bowie knife. It was indeed strange to me that\nI could look without passion or vindictiveness on such a person so\ndisposed. I suppose it was the impersonal spirit within me which was at\nthe moment receptive, and that all human passion, being ultimately of\nthe flesh, was latent. At the time, though I was conscious of it, it did\nnot strike me as strange; no more strange than that I could see far and\nnear at the same glance, and take in great space and an impossible\nwilderness of detail. No more strange, than that all things were for me\nresolved into their elements; that fog ceased to deaden or darkness\nto hide; that timber and iron, deck and panel and partition, beam and\ndoor and bulkhead were as transparent as glass. In my mind was a vague\nintention of making examination of every detail which could bear on the\ndanger of Marjory. But even whilst such an idea was in its incipient\nstage, so swift is the mechanism of thought, my eyes beheld, as though\nit were through the sides of the ship, a boat pass out from a watercave\nin the cliffs behind the Rock of Dunbuy. In it I saw, with the same\nseeing eye which gave me power in aught else, seven men some of whom I\nknew at a glance to be those whom Marjory had described in the tunnel.\nAll but one I surveyed calmly, and weighed up as it were with\ncomplacency; but this one was a huge coal-black negro, hideous, and of\nrepulsive aspect. A glimpse of him made my blood run cold, and filled my\nmind at once with hate and fear. As I looked, the boat came towards the\nship with inconceivable rapidity. It was not that she moved fast through\nthe water, for her progress was in reality slow and laboured. The wind\nand the sea had risen; half a gale was blowing and the seas were running\nso high that the ship rose and fell, pitched and rolled and tossed\nabout like a toy. It was, that time, like distance, was in my mind\nobliterated. Truly, I was looking with spirit eyes, and under all\nspiritual conditions.\n\nThe boat drew close to the whaler on the port side, and I saw, as if\nfrom the former, the faces of several men who at the sound of oars came\nrushing from the other side of the ship and leaned over the bulwarks. It\nwas evident that they had expected arrival from the starboard. With some\ndifficulty the boat got close, for the sea was running wilder every\nmoment; and one by one the men began to climb the ladder and disappear\nover the bulwark. With the extraordinary action of sight and mind and\nmemory which was to me at present, I followed each and all of them at\nthe same time. They hurriedly rigged up a whip and began to raise from\nthe boat parcels of great weight. In the doing of this one of them, the\nnegro, was officious and was always trying to examine each parcel as it\ncame on board; but he was ever and always repulsed. The others would not\nallow him to touch anything; at each rebuff he retired scowling. All\nthis must, under ordinary conditions, have taken much time, but to my\nspirit-ruled eyes it all passed with wondrous rapidity....\n\nI became conscious that things around me were growing less clear. The\nfog seemed to be stealing over the sea, as I had seen it earlier in the\nevening, and to wrap up details from my sight. The great expanse of the\nsea and the ships upon it, and all the wonders of the deep became lost\nin the growing darkness. I found, quicker and quicker, my thoughts like\nmy eyes, centred on the deck of the ship. At a moment, when all others\nwere engaged and did not notice him, I saw the great negro, his face\nover-much distorted with an evil smile, steal towards the after hatchway\nand disappear. With the growing of the fog and the dark, I was losing\nthe power to see through things opaque and material; and it came to me\nas an actual shock that the negro passed beyond my vision. With his\ngoing, the fear in my heart grew and grew; till, in my frantic human\npassion, all that was ethereal around me faded and went out like a dying\nflame....\n\nThe anguish of my soul, in my fear for my beloved, tore my true spirit\nout of its phantom existence back to stern working life....\n\nI found myself, chilled and sick at heart, kneeling by the marble-cold,\nstiffening body of Gormala, on the lone rock under the cliff. The rising\nwind whistled by me in the crannies above, and the rising sea in angry\nrushes leaped at us by the black shining rocks. All was so dark around\nme that my eyes, accustomed to the power given in my vision of making\ntheir own light, could not pierce the fog and the gloom. I tried to look\nat my watch, but could only see the dial dimly; I could not distinguish\nthe figures on it and I feared to light a match lest such might betray\nmy presence. Fortunately my watch could strike the hours and minutes,\nand I found it was now half past one o'clock. I still, therefore, had\nthree-quarters of an hour, for I remembered the lesson of the whaler's\nchronometer. I knew there would be no time nor opportunity to bring\nGormala's body to the top of the cliff--at present; so I carried her up\nto the highest point of the underlying rock, which was well above high\nwater mark.\n\nReverently and with blessing I closed her dead eyes, which still looked\nup at the sky with a sort of ghostly curiosity. Then I clambered up\nthe steep pathway and made my way as quickly as I could round to the\nother side of the Haven, to try if I could discover any trace of the\nblackmailers, or any indication of the water-cave in which their boat\nwas hidden. The cliffs here are wofully steep, and hang far over the\nsea; so that there is no possibility of lying on the cliff edge and\npeering over. Round here also the stark steepness forbids the existence\nof even the tiniest track; a hare could not find its way along these\nbeetling cliffs. The only way of making search of this channel would be\nto follow round in a boat. The nearest point to procure one would be at\nthe little harbour beside the Bullers O'Buchan, and for this there was\nnot time. I was in dire doubt as to what was best to do; and I longed\nwith a sickening force for the presence of Montgomery or some of our\nparty who would know how to deal with such a situation. I was not\nanxious for the present moment; but I wanted to take all precautions\nagainst the time which was coming. Well I knew that the vision I had\nseen with the eyes of the dead Gormala was no mere phantasm of the mind;\nthat it was no promise of what might be, but a grim picture of what\nwould be. There was never a doubt in my mind as to its accuracy. Oh! if\nI could have seen more of what was to happen; if I could have lingered\nbut a few instants longer! For with the speed at which things had\npassed before my inner eye in that strange time, every second might have\nmeant the joy or sorrow of a lifetime. How I groaned with regret, and\ncursed my own precipitancy, that I could not wait and learn through the\nmedium of the dead woman's spiritual eyes the truths that were to be\nborne in mind!\n\nBut it was of no use to fret; action of some sort would be necessary if\nMarjory was to be saved. In one way I might help. Even alone I might\nsave her, if I could get out to the whaler unknown to her crew. I knew I\ncould manage this, for anyhow I could swim; for a weapon which the water\ncould not render useless I had the dagger I had taken from Don\nBernardino. Should other weapons be necessary I might be able to lay\nhands on them in the cabin next Marjory's, where the red-bearded man lay\nasleep. I did not know whether it would be better to go in search of\nsome of my comrades, or to wait the arrival of the Don, who was to be\nback within an hour of the time of leaving. I was still trying to make\nup my mind when the difficulty was settled for me by the arrival of the\nSpaniard, accompanied by one of the young American naval officers.\n\nWhen I told them of my vision I could see, even in the darkness which\nprevailed, that neither of them was content to accept its accuracy\nin blind faith. I was at first impatient; but this wore away when I\nremembered that neither of them had any knowledge of my experiences in\nthe way of Second Sight, or indeed of the phenomenon at all. Neither in\nSpain nor America does such a belief prevail; and I have no doubt that\nto both of them came the idea that worry and anxiety had turned my\nbrain. Even when I told them how I meant to back my belief by swimming\nout beyond the Dunbuy Rock in time to reach the ship before the boat\nwould arrive, they were not convinced. The method of reception of the\nidea by each was, however, characteristic of his race and nation. To\nthe high-bred Spaniard, whose life had been ruled by laws of honour and\nof individual responsibility, no act done in the cause of chivalry could\nbe other than worthy; he did not question the sanity of the keeping of\nsuch a purpose. The practical American, however, though equally willing\nto make self-sacrifice, and to dare all things in the course of honour\nand duty, looked at my intention with regard to its result; was I taking\nthe step which would have the best result with regard to the girl whom\nwe were all trying to save. Whilst the Spaniard raised his hat and said:\n\n\"May God watch over your gallant enterprise, Senor; and hold your life,\nand that of her whom you love, in the hollow of His hand!\" The American\nsaid:\n\n\"Honest injun! old chap, is that the best you can do? If it's only a man\nand a life you want, count me in every time. I'm a swimmer, too; and I'm\na youngster that don't count. So far as that goes, I'm on. But you've\ngot to find the ship, you know! If she was there now, I should say 'risk\nit'; and I'd come with you if you liked. But there's the whole North Sea\nout there, with room for a hundred million of whalers without their\njostling. No, no! Come, I say, let us find another way round; where we\ncan help the girl all together!\" He was a good young fellow, as well\nas a fine one, and it was evident he meant well. But there was no use\narguing; my mind was made up, and, after assuring him that I was in\nearnest, I told him that I was taking a couple of rockets with me which\nI would try to keep dry so that should occasion serve I would make\nmanifest the whereabouts of the whaler. He already knew what to do with\nregard to signalling from shore, in case the boats of the whaler should\nbe seen.\n\nWhen we had made what preparations we could for the work each of us had\nin hand, the time came for my starting on my perilous enterprise. As\nmy purpose became more definite, my companions, who I think doubted in\ntheir hearts its sincerity, became somewhat more demonstrative. It was\none thing to have a vague intention of setting out on a wild journey of\nthe kind, and even here common sense rebelled. But on the edge of the\nhigh cliff, in the dark, amid the fog which came boiling up from below\nas the wind puffs drove it on shore; when below our feet the rising\nwaves broke against the rocks with an ominous sound, made into a roar by\nthe broken fastnesses of the cliffs, the whole thing must have seemed as\nan act of madness. When through a break in the fog-belt we could catch\na glimpse of the dark water leaping far below into furious, scattering\nlines of foam, to dare the terrors of such a sea at such a time was like\ngoing deliberately to certain death. My own heart quailed at moments;\nwhen I saw through the fog wreaths the narrow track, down which I must\nagain descend to where Gormala's body lay, fading into a horrid gloom;\nor when the sound of breaking water drove up, muffled by the dark mist.\nMy faith in the vision was strong, however, and by keeping my mind\nfixed on it I could shut out present terrors. I shook hands with my two\nfriends, and, taking courage from the strong grip of their hands, set\nmyself resolutely to my journey down the cliff. The last words the young\nnavy man said to me were:\n\n\"Remember, if you do reach the whaler, that a gleam of light of any kind\nwill give us a hint of where you are. Once the men of the _Keystone_ see\nit, they'll do the rest at sea; as we shall on land. Give us such a\nlight when the time comes--if you have to fire the ship to get it!\"\n\nAt the foot of the cliff path the prospect was almost terrifying. The\nrocks were so washed with the churning water, as the waves leaped at\nthem, that now and again only black tops could be seen rising out of\nthe waste of white water; and a moment after, as the wave fell back,\nthere would be a great mass of jagged rocks, all stark and grim, blacker\nthan their own blackness, with the water streaming down them, and great\nrifts yawning between. Outside, the sea was a grim terror, a wildness of\nrising waves and lines of foam, all shrouded in fog and gloom. Through\nall came a myriad of disconcerting sounds, vague and fearsome, from\nwhere the waves clashed or beat into the sounding caverns of Dunbuy.\nNothing but the faith which I had in the vision of Marjory, which came\nto me with the dead eyes of the western Seer, could have carried me out\ninto that dreadful gloom. All its possibilities of horror and danger\nwoke to me at once, and for a moment appalled me.\n\nBut Faith is a conquering power; even the habit of believing, in which I\nhad been taught, stood to me in this wild hour. No sceptic, no doubter,\ncould have gone forth as I did into that unknown of gloom and fear.\n\nI waited till a great wave was swept in close under my bare feet. Then,\nwith a silent prayer, and an emboldening thought: 'For Marjory!' I\nleaped into the coming water.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LI\n\nIN THE SEA FOG\n\n\nFor a few minutes I was engaged in a wild struggle to get away from the\nrocks, and not to be forced back by the shoreward rush and sweep of the\nwaves. I was buffeted by them, and half-choked by the boiling foam; but\nI kept blindly and desperately to my task, and presently knew that I had\nonly to deal with the current and the natural rise and fall of the\nrollers. Down on the water the air was full of noises, so that it was\nhard to distinguish any individual sound; but the fog lay less dense on\nthe surface than above it, so that I could see a little better around\nme.\n\nOn the sea there is always more or less light; even in this time of\nmidnight gloom, with moon and stars hidden by the fog, and with none of\nthat phosphorescence which at times makes a luminous glow of its own\nover the water, I could see things at an unexpected distance. More than\nall, was I surprised as well as cheered to find that I could distinguish\nthe features of the land from the sea, better than I could from land\ndiscern anything at sea. When I looked back, the shore rose, a dark\nuneven line, unbroken save where the Haven of Dunbuy running inland made\nan angle against the sky. But beside me, the great Rock of Dunbuy rose\ngigantic and black; it was like a mountain towering over me. The tide\nwas running down so that when I had got out of the current running\ninland behind the rock I was in comparatively calm water. There was no\ndownward current, but only a slow backwater, which insensibly took me\ncloser to the Rock. Keeping in this shelter, I swam on and out; I saved\nmyself as much as I could, for I knew of the terrible demand on my\nstrength which lay before me. It must have been about ten minutes,\nthough it seemed infinitely longer, when I began to emerge from the\nshelter of the Rock and to find again the force of the outer current.\nThe waves were wilder here too; not so wild as just in shore before they\nbroke, but they were considerably larger in their rise and fall. As I\nswam on, I looked back now and then, and saw Dunbuy behind me towering\nupward, though not so monstrously as when I had been under its lee. The\ncurrent was beginning already to bear me downwards; so I changed my\ncourse, and got back to the sheltered water again. Thus I crept round\nunder the lee of the Rock, till all at once I found myself in the angry\nrace, where the current beat on and off the cliff. It took me all my\nstrength and care to swim through this; when the force of the current\nbegan to slacken, as I emerged from the race, I found myself panting and\nbreathless with the exertion.\n\nBut when I looked around me from this point, where the east opened to\nme, there was something which restored all my courage and hope, though\nit did not still the beating of my heart.\n\nClose by, seemingly only a couple of hundred yards off to the north\neast, lay a ship whose masts and spars stood out against the sky. I\ncould see her clearly, before a coming belt of fog bore down on her.\n\nThe apprehension lest I should miss her in the fog chilled me more than\nthe sea water in which I was immersed; for all possibilities of evil\nbecame fears to me, now that the realisation of my vision was clear. I\nwas glad of the darkness; it was a guarantee against discovery. I swam\non quietly, and was rejoiced to find as I drew close that I was on the\nport side of the ship; well I remembered how in my vision the boat\napproached to port, to the surprise of the men who were looking out for\nit on the other side. I found the rope ladder easily enough, and did not\nhave much difficulty in getting a foothold on it. Ascending cautiously,\nand watching every inch of the way, I climbed the bulwark and hid behind\na water barrel close to the mast. From this security I looked out, and\nsaw the backs of several men ranged along the starboard bulwark. They\nwere intent on their watching, and unsuspicious of my proximity; so I\nstole out and glided as silently as I could into the cabin's entrance.\nIt was not new to me; I had a sense of complete security as to my\nknowledge. The eyes of Gormala's soul were keen!\n\nIn the cabin I recognised at once the smoky lamp and the rude\npreparations for food. Thus emboldened, I came to the door, behind which\nI knew Marjory lay. It was locked and bolted, and the key was gone. I\nslid back the bolt, but the lock baffled me. I was afraid to make the\nslightest noise, lest I should court discovery; so I passed on to the\nnext cabin where was her jailer. He lay just as, in the vision, I had\nseen him; the chronometer was above him and the two heavy revolvers hung\nunderneath it. I slipped in quietly--there were not shoes to remove--and\nreaching over so that the water would not drip from my wet underclothing\non his face, unhooked the two weapons. I belted them round my waist with\nthe strap on which they hung. Then I looked round for the key, but could\nsee no sign of it. There was no time to lose, and it was neither time\nnor place to stand on ceremony; so I took the man by the throat with my\nleft hand, the dagger being in my right, and held with such a grip that\nthe blood seemed to leap into his face in a second. He could utter\nno sound, but instinctively his hand went back and up to where the\nrevolvers had hung. I whispered in a low tone:\n\n\"It's no use. Give me the key. I don't value your life a pin!\" He was\nwell plucked, and he was manifestly used to tight places. He did not\nattempt to speak or parley; but whilst I had been whispering, his right\nhand had got hold of a knife. It was a bowie, and he was dexterous with\nit. With some kind of sharp wrench he threw it open; there was a click\nas the back-spring worked. If I had not had my dagger ready it would\nhave been a bad time for me. But I was prepared; whilst he was making\nthe movement to strike at me, I struck. The keen point of the Spanish\ndagger went right through the upturned wrist, and pinned his hand down\nto the wooden edge of the bunk. Whilst, however, he had been trying\nto strike with his right hand, his left had clutched my left wrist. He\ntried now to loose my grasp from his throat, whilst bending his chin\ndown he made a furious effort to tear at my hand with his teeth.\nNever in my life did I more need my strength and weight. The man was\nmanifestly a fighter, trained in many a wild 'rough-and-tumble', and his\nnerves were like iron. I feared to let go the hilt of the dagger, lest\nin his violent struggling he should tear his wrist away and so free his\nhand. Having, however, got my right knee raised, I pressed down with it\nhis arm on the edge of the bunk and so freed my right hand. He continued\nto struggle ferociously. I knew well it was life and death, not only for\nme, but for Marjory.\n\nIt was his life or mine; and he had to pay the penalty of his crime.\n\nSo intent was I on the struggle that I had not heard the approach of the\nboat with his comrades. It was only when I stood panting, with the limp\nthroat between my fingers which were white at the knuckles with the\nstrain, that the sound of voices and the tramp of feet on deck reached\nmy intelligence. Then indeed I knew there was no time to lose. I\nsearched the dead man's pockets and found a key, which I tried in the\nlock of Marjory's cabin. When I opened the door she started up; the hand\nin her bosom was whipped out with a flash, and in an instant a long\nsteel bonnet pin was ready to drive into her breast. My agonised\nwhisper:\n\n\"Marjory, it is I!\" only reached her mind in time to hold her hand. She\ndid not speak; but never can I forget the look of joy that illumined her\npoor, pale face. I put my finger on my lip, and held out my hand to her.\nShe rose, with the obedience of a child, and came with me. I was just\ngoing out into the cabin, when I heard the creak of a heavy footstep on\nthe companion way. So I motioned her back, and, drawing the dagger from\nmy belt, stood ready. I knew who it was that was coming; yet I dared not\nuse the pistols, save as a last resource.\n\nI stood behind the door. The negro did not expect anyone, or any\nobstacle; he came on unthinkingly, save for whatever purpose of evil was\nin his mind. He was armed, as were all the members of the blackmail\ngang. In a belt across his shoulder, slung Kentucky fashion, were two\ngreat seven shooters; and across his waist behind was a great bowie\nknife, with handle ready to grasp. Moreover, nigger-like, the handle of\na razor rose out of the breast pocket of his dark flannel shirt. He did\nnot, however, manifestly purpose using his weapons--at present at any\nrate; there was not any sign of danger or opposition in front of him.\nHis comrades were busy at present in embarking the treasure, and would\nbe for many an hour to come, in helping to work the ship clear into\nsafety. Every minute now the wind was rising, and the waves swelling to\nsuch proportions that the anchored ship rocked like a bell-buoy in a\nstorm. In the cabin I had to hold on, or I should have been shot from\nmy place into view. But the huge negro cared for none of these things.\nHe was callous to everything, and there was such a wicked, devilish\npurpose in his look that my heart hardened grimly in the antagonism of\nman to man. Nay more, it was not a man that I loathed; I would have\nkilled this beast with less compunction than I would kill a rat or a\nsnake. Never in my life did I behold such a wicked face. In feature and\nexpression there was every trace and potentiality of evil; and these\nsuperimposed on a racial brutality which made my gorge rise. Well indeed\ndid I understand now the one terror which had in all her troubles come\nto Marjory, and how these wretches had used it to mould her to their\nends. I knew now why, sleeping or waking, she held that steel spike\nagainst her heart. If--\n\nThe thought was too much for me. Even now, though I was beside her, she\nwas beset by her enemies. We were both still practically prisoners on a\nhostile ship, and even now this demon was intent on unspeakable wrong. I\ndid not pause; I did not shrink from the terrible task before me. With a\nbound I was upon him, and I had struck at his heart; struck so truly and\nso terrible a blow, that the hilt of the dagger struck his ribs with a\nthud like the blow of a cudgel. The blood seemed to leap out at me, even\nas the blow fell. With spasmodic reaction he tumbled forwards; fell\nwithout a sound, and so quickly that had not I, fearing lest the noise\nof his falling might betray me, caught him, he would have dropped like a\nstricken bullock.\n\nNever before did I understand the pleasure of killing a man. Since then,\nit makes me shudder when I think of how so potent a passion, or so keen\na pleasure, can rest latent in the heart of a righteous man. It may have\nbeen that between the man and myself was all the antagonism that came\nfrom race, and fear, and wrongdoing; but the act of his killing was to\nme a joy unspeakable. It will rest with me as a wild pleasure till I\ndie.\n\nI took all the arms he had about him, two revolvers and a knife; they\nwould give me fourteen more shots were I hard pressed. In any case they\nwere safer, so far as Marjory and I were concerned, in my hands than\nin those of our enemies. I dragged the body of the negro into the cabin\nwith the other dead man; then I closed the door on them, and when\nMarjory joined me, I locked the door of her cabin and took away the key.\nIn case of suspicion this might give us a few minutes of extra time.\n\nMarjory came with me up on deck; and as she caught sight of the open sea\nthere was an unspeakable gladness on her face. We seized a favourable\nopportunity, when no one was looking, for all on deck were busy hauling\nup the treasure; and slipped behind the cask fastened to the mast. There\nwe breathed freely. We both felt that should the worst come to the\nworst we could get away before any one could touch us. One rush to the\nbulwarks and over. They would never attempt to follow us, and there was\na chance of a swim to shore. I gave Marjory a belt with two revolvers.\nAs she strapped it on she felt safer; I knew it by the way she drew\nherself up, and threw back her shoulders.\n\nWhen the last of the bags which held the treasure came on board, the men\nwho had come with it closed in a ring around the mass as it lay on deck.\nThey were all armed; I could see that they did not trust the sailors,\nfor each moment some one's hand would go back to his gun. We heard one\nof them ask as he looked round: \"What has become of that damned nigger?\nHe must take his share of work!\" Marjory was very brave and very still;\nI could see that her nerve was coming back to her. After a little\nwhispered conversation, the newcomers began to carry the bags down to\nthe cabin; it was slow work, for two always stood guard above, and two\nremained down below evidently on similar duty. Discovery of the dead man\nmust come soon, so Marjory and I stole behind the foremast which was\nwell away from every one. She was first, and as she began to pass behind\nshe recoiled; she got the drop on some one in front of her. There was a\nsmothered 'h-s-s-sh' and she lowered her weapon. Turning to me she said\nin a faint whisper:\n\n\"It is the Spaniard; what is he doing here?\" I whispered back:\n\n\"Be good to him. He is a noble fellow, and has behaved like a knight of\nold!\" I pressed forward and took his hand. \"How did you get here?\" I\nasked. His answer was given in so faint a voice that I could see that he\nwas spent and tired, if not injured:\n\n\"I swam, too. When I saw their boat pull out of the northern channel, I\nmanaged to scramble down part of the cliff, and then jumped. Fortunately\nI was not injured. It was a long, weary swim, and I thought I should\nnever be able to get through; but at last the current took me and\ncarried me to the ship. She was anchored with a hawser, not a cable.\nI managed to climb up it; and when I was on board I cut it nearly\nthrough.\"\n\nEven as he spoke there was a queer lurch of the ship which lay stern\nforward, and a smothered ejaculation from all the seamen.\n\nThe hawser had parted and we were drifting before wind and tide. Then it\nwas that I felt we should give warning to the yacht and the battleship.\nI knew that they were not far off; had I not seen them in my vision,\nwhich had now been proven. Then it was also that the words of the young\nAmerican came back to me: \"Give us a light, if you have to fire the ship\nto get it.\"\n\nAll this time, from the moment when I had set foot on the whaler's deck\ntill this instant, events had moved with inconceivable rapidity. There\nhad been one silent, breathless rush; during which two lives had been\ntaken and Marjory set free. Only a few minutes had elapsed in all; and\nwhen I looked around under the altered conditions, things seemed to be\nalmost where they had been. It was like the picture in one's mind made\nby a lightning flash; when the period of reception is less than the time\nof the smallest action, and movement is lost in time. The fog belt was\nthinning out, and there was in the night air a faint suggestion that one\nmight see, if there were anything to be seen.\n\nThe great Rock of Dunbuy towered up; I could just distinguish so much on\nthe land side. Whilst I was looking, there came a sudden light and then\na whirr; high overhead through the sea fog we could see faintly the\nfiery trail of a rocket.\n\nInstantly out at sea was an answer; a great ray of light shot upwards,\nand we could see its reflection in the sky. None of us said anything;\nbut instinctively Marjory and I clasped hands. Then the light ray seemed\nto fall downward to the sea. But as it came down, the fog seemed to\ngrow thicker and thicker till the light was lost in its density. There\nwas stir of all on our ship. No loud word was spoken, but whispered\ndirections, given with smothered curses, flew. Each man of the crew\nseemed to run to his post, and with a screeching and straining the sails\nrose. The vessel began to slip through the water with added speed. Now,\nif ever, was our time to warn our friends. The little rockets which I\nhad brought had been sodden with water and were useless, and besides we\nhad no way of getting a light. The only way of warning was by sound, and\nthe only sound to carry was a pistol shot. For an instant I hesitated,\nfor a shot meant a life if we should be pushed to it. But it must be\ndone; so signing to the others I ran aft and when close to the mast\nfired my revolver. Instantly around me was a chorus of curses. I bent\ndouble and ran back, seeing through the darkness vague forms rush to\nwhere I had been. The fog was closing thicker around us; it seemed to\nboil over the bulwarks as we passed along. We had either passed into\nanother belt of fog, or one was closing down upon us with the wind. The\nsound of the pistol shot had evidently reached the war ship. She was far\noff us, and the sounds came faintly over the waste of stormy sea; but\nthere was no mistaking the cheer followed by commands. These sounded\nfaint and hoarsely; a few words were spoken with a trumpet, and then\ncame the shrill whistle of the boatswain's pipe.\n\nOn our own deck was rushing to and fro, and frenzied labour everywhere.\nThe first object was to get away from the searchlight; they would seek\npresently, no doubt, for who had fired the betraying shot. If I could\nhave known what to do, so as to stay our progress, there would have been\nother shots; for now that we were moving through the water, every second\nmight take us further from the shore and place us deeper in the toils of\nour foes.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LII\n\nTHE SKARES\n\n\nI whispered to Marjory and Don Bernardino:\n\n\"If they once get away we are lost! We must stop them at all hazards!\"\nThe Spaniard nodded and Marjory squeezed my hands; there was no need\nof speech. Then I fixed the order of battle. I was to fire first, then\nthe Spaniard, then Marjory, each saving his fire till we knew whether\nanother shot was required. This precaution was necessary, as we had no\nreserve ammunition. We took it for granted that the chambers of the\nrevolvers were full; my one shot had been satisfactory in this respect.\nWhen the sails were set and we began rushing through the water I saw\nthat even at the risk of betraying ourselves to our enemies we must give\nwarning again, and so fired. There was an answering cheer from the\n_Keystone_ through the fog; and then a sudden rush forward of those on\nour own deck. When they were close to us, the seamen hung back; but the\nmen of the gang kept on firing as they came. Fortunately we were in a\nline behind cover, for I could hear the 'ping' and the tearing wood as\nthe bullets struck the mast. I fired a shot just to show that we were\narmed; and heard a sharp cry. Then they fell back. In a moment or two\nthey also had formed their plan of battle. These were men used to such\nencounters; and as they knew that at such times a quick rush may mean\neverything, they did not let the grass grow under their feet. I could\nsee one of the seamen remonstrating with them, and hear the quick,\nangry tones of his voice, though I could not distinguish the words.\n\nHe pointed out into the fog, where now there was distinctly a luminous\npatch of light: the searchlight was moving towards us. The _Keystone_\nwas coming down on us.\n\nThe blackmailer shook off the seaman and, then gave some directions to\nhis comrades; they spread out right and left of us, and tried to find\nsome kind of cover. I lifted Marjory and put her standing on the barrel\nfastened behind the mast, for I thought that as the flash of my pistol\nhad come from the deck they would not expect any one to be raised so\nhigh. Don Bernardino and I curled down on the deck, and our opponents\nbegan to fire. In the thickening fog, and with the motion of the ship\nwhich threw us all about like ninepins, their aim was vague; fortunately\nno one was hit. When I thought I had a chance I fired, but there was\nno response; the Don got a shot and Marjory another, but there was no\nsound, save that of the bullets striking on wood or iron. Then Marjory,\nwhose traditional instinct was coming into play, fired twice in rapid\nsuccession; there was a quick exclamation and then a flood of horrible\nprofanity, the man was only winged. Again and again they fired, and I\nheard a groan behind me from the Don.\n\n\"What's that?\" I whispered, not daring to stop or even to look back:\n\n\"My arm! Take my pistol, I cannot shoot with my left hand.\" I put my\nhand back, and he placed the revolver in it. I saw a dark form rush\nacross the deck and fired--and missed. I tried another shot; but the\nweapon only answered with a click; the chambers were exhausted. So I\nused the other revolver. And so for a few minutes a furious fight went\non. Marjory seldom fired, she was holding herself in reserve; but\nbefore I knew what was happening my second revolver was empty. Our\nantagonists were no chickens at their work; there was little to teach\nany of them in such a method of contest as this. Some one had evidently\nbeen counting the shots, for he suddenly called out:\n\n\"Not yet boys! They've at least three shots still!\" With a sudden\nsimultaneous rush they ran back into shelter.\n\nDuring this time we had been tearing through the water at our full\nspeed. But behind us on the port quarter was the sound of a great ship\nsteaming on. The roar of the furnaces could be heard in the trumpeting\nof the funnels. The boatswain's whistles were piping, and there were\nvoices of command cutting hoarsely through the fog. The searchlight too\nwas at work; we could see its rays high up on the mist, though they did\nnot at the moment penetrate sufficiently to expose us to the lookout of\nthe _Keystone_. Closer on our starboard quarter was another sound which\ncame on the trailing wind, the rush of a small vessel running fast.\nWe could hear down the wind the sharp 'slap slap' of the waves on the\nbows, and the roaring of the wind among the cordage. This must be\nthe _Sporran_ following us close with grim disregard of danger. The\ncommander of the whaler, recognising the possibility of discovery, put\nhis helm hard to starboard. I could myself not see through the darkness;\nbut the seaman did and took his chance of grounding in Cruden Bay. When\nwe had run in a little way the helm was jammed hard down again, and\nwe ran on the other tack; for the moment we were lost to both the war\nship and the yacht. Marjory looked at me appealingly and I nodded; the\nsituation was not one to be risked. She fired another shot from her\npistol. There was an immediate reply from far out on our port side in\nthe shape of more directions spoken with the trumpet and answering\npiping from the boatswains. Several shots were fired towards us by the\ngang; they were manifestly on chance, for they went wildly wide of us.\nThen we could hear an angry remonstrance from the whaler captain, and a\nthreat that if there were any more firing, he would down with his sails\nand take chance of being captured. One of the gang answered him:\n\n\"That packet can't capture you within the three-mile limit; it's a\ncruiser of Uncle Sam's and they won't risk having to lie up in harbour\nhere till the war is over.\" To which the other surlily replied:\n\n\"I wouldn't put money on it. Anyhow someone will! You keep quiet if you\ncan. There's enough against us already if we should be caught!\" The\nreply of the blackmailer was at least practical. I could not see what he\ndid, but I took it that he put his pistol to the captain's head as he\nsaid with a frightful oath:\n\n\"You'll go on as you arranged with me; or I'll blow your brains out\nwhere you stand. There's quite enough against any of us, you included;\nso your one chance anyhow is to get out of this hole. See?\" The captain\naccepted the position and gave his orders with a quiet delivery, to the\neffect that we ran first shorewards and then to starboard again till we\nwere running back on our tracks like a hare.\n\nSuddenly, however, this course was brought to an end by our almost\nrunning into a small vessel which as we passed I could see by its trim\nappearance was a yacht. We were so close for a few seconds, whilst we\nran across her stern, that I shouted out:\n\n\"All right, MacRae. All safe as yet. She's trying to run out to sea. Try\nto tell the _Keystone_.\" The answer was a cheer from all aboard.\n\nAs our ship swept into the fog, several of our enemies ran at us. I\nhanded Don Bernardino his own dagger and took the bowie knife myself.\nThen we stood ready in case our foes should get to close quarters.\nThey got nearly up to us, firing as they came; but we were just then\nsheltering behind the mast and no injury was done. They hesitated to\ncome on, not seeing us; and we waited. As we stood with beating hearts\nthe ship began to come to starboard again. We must have been sheltered\nin some way, for we did not seem to feel either wind or tide so much as\nbefore. Suddenly one of the seamen said:\n\n\"Whist! I hear breakers!\" The rest paused and listened, and the captain\ncalled out:\n\n\"Hard to starboard; we are running on shore!\" The ship answered at once,\nand we began to run across the wind, feeling the tide at the same time.\nBut as we went, a searchlight flashed on the fog before us. We could not\nstop or change quick enough to quite avoid the ship from which it came,\nbut the helm was put hard to starboard again and we ran close along side\na great war ship. I could see her tower with protruding cannon as we ran\nby. A voice came through a speaking trumpet, and I could just catch the\nfirst words as the vessel swept by us:\n\n\"Rocks ahead!\" The instinct of the seaman spoke, even at such a time, to\nkeep another vessel from harm. The answer from our vessel was a volley\nof curses. Then the searchlight swept our deck, and we could see all our\nenemies. They were round us in a great ring and closing in upon us. They\nsaw us, too, and with a shout began to run in. I took Marjory by the\nwaist and ran with her to the bow of the ship; I flung her up on the\nbulwark and jumped up beside her. Don Bernardino joined us in a moment,\nand we saw the searchlight as it passed us and pierced into the fog\nahead. Already the bulk of the battleship was almost lost in the mist;\nthere was only a faint indication of her presence in a monstrous mass\nbehind the searchlight, and the end of a spar rising above the fog. In\nfront of us there was a great roaring of water and that sharp rushing\nsound which comes from the back sweep of a broken wave. Our skipper saw\nthe danger, and in a voice like a trumpet gave his orders.\n\nBut it was too late to do anything. As the searchlight again swept our\ndeck, I saw the ring of men break up and scatter; almost at the same\nmoment the rays passing beyond us, fell on a low rock rising from the\nsea up whose sides great waves were dashing. We were rushing to it,\nborne by wind and tide in a terrible haste.\n\nAt that instant we struck a rock below the water. With the shock we\nthree were thrown forward into the sea. I heard a despairing shout\nbehind us; and then the water closed over my head.\n\nWhen I rose it was in a wild agony of fear for Marjory. She had been\nsitting to my left on the bulwark and must therefore have fallen to\nseaward of me. I raised myself as well as I could and looked around;\nand, by God's grace, saw two hands rising above the water a few yards\nfrom me. With all my might I struggled towards them, and was able to\ndrag my wife up to the surface. When I had her with me, though my terror\nand anxiety increased, I could think. At such moments the mind acts with\nlightning speed, and in a second or two I came to the conclusion that\nthe rock we had struck must be amongst the Skares. If so, the only\nchance was to edge in with the tide and try to avoid striking any of the\nunderlying rocks which I knew well were so deadly. Had not I seen\nLauchlane Macleod come to his death through them.\n\nIt was a desperate struggle before us. The tide was racing amongst the\nrocks, and even were there no waves it would have been a difficult task\nto have won through it into shore. For myself I was a strong enough\nswimmer to have found my way in, even if I had had to round the outer\nrock and keep up to the harbour of Whinnyfold. But with Marjory to care\nfor, too--Marjory who had only lately learned to swim.... The prospect\nwas indeed a terrible one. We must not lose a chance, and so I made my\nwife loose her skirts which fell away in the drag of the water; she\ncould then swim more freely and to the best of her power.\n\nThe wind beat fiercely, and the tops of the breaking waves nearly choked\nus as they flew. There was just light enough down on the water level to\nsee rocks a few yards ahead; the line of the shore rose like one dim\nopaque mass. In the darkness and the stress of the tide race there was\nlittle I could do, save keep Marjory's head and my own above the water\nand let the current bear us on. I must avoid the rocks as well as I\ncould, and let all my efforts tend to bring us shorewards. There was not\ntime for fears or doubting, or hoping; the moments must pass and the\nstruggle be made, never-ending though it seemed to be.\n\nAfter a few minutes I began to tire; the strain of the last few days and\nmy late effort in reaching the whaler had begun to tell on me. I had now\nand again a passing thought of Don Bernardino and the friends who had\nbeen helping us; but they were all far off. The Spaniard I should\nprobably never seen again; the others might never see us.... I was\nrelapsing into the lethargy of despair.\n\nWith a violent effort I woke to the task before me, and kept sternly on\nmy way. Marjory was striving her utmost; but her strength was failing.\nHer weight was becoming deader.... That nerved me to further effort,\nand I swam on so frantically that I drew closer to the mainland. Here\nthere was shelter of a kind; the waves broken by the outer rocks\nwere less forceful. The crested tops which the wind had driven on us\nwere weakening also. There was hope in this and it kept me up. On I\nfought--on--on--on. Oh! would the struggle never end! I shut my teeth,\nand forged on fiercely. I could feel that we were going with the rush of\nthe waves through a gully between sunken rocks.\n\nJoy! there was shore beneath my feet, rough pebbles which rolled and\nworked against each other. The wave pulled us back. But my heart was\nrenewed again. I made one more frantic effort, and swam closer to the\nland. Then as I saw the wave began to recoil I put down my feet, and\nwith the last of my strength lifting Marjory in my arms I fought\nfiercely with the retreating wave. Staggering over the screaming\npebbles, exhausted to the point of death, I bore her high up on the\nbeach and laid her down. Then I sank lifeless beside her cold body.\n\nThe last thing I remember was the faint light of the coming dawn,\nfalling on her marble-white face as she lay on the shore.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LIII\n\nFROM THE DEEP\n\n\nIt could not have been more than a few minutes before I recovered\nconsciousness, if indeed I were ever absolutely unconscious. It was\nrather the inevitable yielding to a strain on nerve and muscle and\nbrain, than a time of oblivion. I think that I always knew that I was\nby the sea, and that Marjory was beside me and in trouble; but that was\nall. I was in the nightmare stage, when one can understand danger and\nrealise terror; and when the only thing impossible to one is to do\nanything. Certainly, when I came to myself I was fully conscious of my\nsurroundings. I was even surprised that I did not see on Marjory's pale\nface, the cold faint gleam of light which had been there when last I saw\nher. The general light had, however, increased. The strand and the rocks\nlooked now not black, but inexpressibly drear in the uniform grey which\nseemed to make all colour and shape and distance into one sad flat\nscreen. My first work was of course to attend Marjory. For a while I\nfeared that she was dead, so white was she amid the surrounding grey.\nBut her heart still beat, and her breast moved, though very slightly,\nwith her breathing. I could now see that we were in Broad Haven and, so,\nclose to my own home. I could see through the pierced rock called the\n\"Puir Mon.\" I took my wife in my arms and carried her, though with\ninfinite difficulty for I was sorely exhausted, up the steep path, and\nbrought her into the house. I had to break the door in again, but there\nwas no one to help me or to interfere in the matter. I got some brandy\nand poured a few drops into her mouth, and laid her in a pile of rugs\nwhilst I lit the fire. The supply of whin bushes in the wood house was\nnot exhausted, and very soon there was a roaring fire. When Marjory\nopened her eyes and looked around the room, a certain amount of\nconsciousness came to her. She imagined the occasion of her being with\nme was the same as when we had escaped from the flooded cave; holding\nout her arms she said to me with infinite love and sweetness:\n\n\"Thank God, dear, you are safe!\" A moment later she rubbed her eyes and\nsat up, looking wildly around as one does after a hideous dream. In her\nsurvey, however, her eyes lit on her own figure, and a real wave of\nshame swept over her; she hastily pulled the rug round her shoulders and\nsank back. The habit of personal decorum had conquered fear. She closed\nher eyes for a moment or two to remember, and when she opened them was\nin full possession of all her faculties and her memory.\n\n\"It was no dream! It is all, all real! And I owe my life to you,\ndarling, once again!\" I kissed her, and she sank back with a sigh of\nhappiness. A moment later, however, she started up, crying out to me:\n\n\"But the others, where are they? Quick! quick! let us go to help them if\nwe can!\" She looked wildly round. I understood her wishes, and hurrying\ninto the other room brought her an armful of her clothes.\n\nIn a few minutes she joined me; and hand in hand we went out on the edge\nof the cliff. As we went, I told her of what had happened since she\nbecame unconscious in the water.\n\nThe wind was now blowing fiercely, almost a gale. The sea had risen,\ntill great waves driving amongst the rocks had thrashed the whole region\nof the Skares into a wild field of foam. Below us, the waves dashing\nover the sunken rocks broke on the shore with a loud roaring, and washed\nhigh above the place where we had lain. The fog had lifted, and objects\ncould be seen even at a distance. Far out, some miles away, lay a great\nship; and by the outermost of the Skares a little to the north of the\ngreat rock and where the sunken reef lies, rose part of a broken mast.\nBut there was nothing else to be seen, except away to south a yacht\ntossing about under double-reefed sails. Sea and sky were of a leaden\ngrey, and the heavy clouds that drifted before the gale came so low as\nto make us think that they were the fog belts risen from the sea.\n\nMarjory would not be contented till we had roused the whole village of\nWhinnyfold, and with them had gone all round the cliffs and looked into\nevery little opening to see if there were trace or sign of any of those\nwho had been wrecked with us. But it was all in vain.\n\nWe sent a mounted messenger off to Crom with a note, for we knew in what\nterrible anxiety Mrs. Jack must be. In an incredibly short time the\ngood lady was with us; and was rocking Marjory in her arms, crying and\nlaughing over her wildly. By and bye she got round the carriage from the\nvillage and said to us:\n\n\"And now my dears, I suppose we had better get back to Crom, where you\ncan rest yourselves after this terrible time.\" Marjory came over to me,\nand holding my arm looked at her old nurse lovingly as she said with\ndeep earnestness:\n\n\"You had better go back, dear, and get things ready for us. As for me, I\nshall never willingly leave my husband's side again!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe storm continued for a whole day, growing rougher and wilder with\neach hour. For another day it grew less and less, till finally the wind\nhad died away and only the rough waves spoke of what had been. Then the\nsea began to give up its dead. Some seamen presumably those of the\n_Wilhelmina_ were found along the coast between Whinnyfold and Old\nSlains, and the bodies of two of the blackmailers, terribly mangled,\nwere washed ashore at Cruden Bay. The rest of the sailors and of the\ndesperadoes were never found. Whether they escaped by some miracle, or\nwere swallowed in the sea, will probably never be known.\n\nStrangest of all was the finding of Don Bernardino. The body of the\ngallant Spanish gentleman was found washed up on shore behind the Lord\nNelson rock, just opposite where had been the opening to the cave in\nwhich his noble ancestor had hidden the Pope's treasure. It was as\nthough the sea itself had respected his devotion, and had laid him by\nthe place of his Trust. Marjory and I saw his body brought home to Spain\nwhen the war was over, and laid amongst the tombs of his ancestors. We\npetitioned the Crown; and though no actual leave was given, no objection\nwas made to our removing the golden figure of San Cristobal which\nBenvenuto had wrought for the Pope. It now stands over the Spaniard's\ntomb in the church of San Cristobal in far Castile.\n\n\n\n\nAPPENDICES\n\n\n\n\nAPPENDIX A\n\n\n\"In the First Edition of his work \"The Two Bookes of Francis Bacon,\nof the proficience and advancement of Learning, divine and humane\"\npublished at London in 1605, the Author only alludes briefly to his\nBi-literal Cipher. Speaking of Ciphers generally (Booke II) he says:\n\n\"But the vertues of them, whereby they are to be preferred, are three;\nthat they be not laborious to write and reade; that they bee impossible\nto discypher; and in some cases, that they bee without suspicion.\nThe highest Degree whereof, is to write OMNIA PER OMNIA; which is\nundoubtedly possible, with a proportion Quintuple at most, of the\nwriting infoulding, to the writing infoulded, and no other restrainte\nwhatsoever.\"\n\nIt was not till eighteen years later that he gave to the public an\nexplanation of this 'infoulding' writing. In the rarely beautiful\nedition of the work in Latin printed in London by Haviland in 1623, the\npassage relating to secret writing is much amplified. Indeed the entire\nwork is completed in many ways and greatly enlarged as is shown by its\ntitle.\n\n\"De Dignitate et Augmentis Scientiarum. Libros IX.\"\n\nThe following is his revised statement:\n\n\"Ut vero suspicio omnis absit, aliud Juventum subijciemus, quod certe,\ncum Adolescentuli essemus Parisiis, excogitavimus; nec etiam adhuc visa\nvobis res digna est, quae pereat. Habet enim gradum Ciphrae altissimum;\nnimirum ut _Omnia per Omnia_ significari possint: ita tamen, ut Scriptis\nquae involuitut, quintuplo minor sit, quam ea cui involvatur: Alia nulla\nomnino requiritur Conditio, aut Restrictio. Id hoc modo fiet. Primo,\nuniversae literae Alphabeti in duas tantummodo Literas soluantur, per\nTranspositionem earum. Nam Transpositis duarum Literarum, per Locos\nquinque, Differentiis triginta duabus, multo magis viginti quatuor (qui\nest Numerus Alphabeti apud nos) sufficiet. Huius _Alphabeti_. Exemplum\ntale est.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"But for avoiding suspicion altogether, I will add another contrivance,\nwhich I devised myself when I was at Paris in my early youth, and which\nI still think worthy of preservation. For it has the perfection of a\ncipher, which is to make anything signifying anything; subject however\nto this condition, that the infolding writing shall contain at least\nfive times as many letters as the writing infolded; no other condition\nor restriction is required. The way to do it is this: First let all the\nletters of the Alphabet be resolved into transpositions of two letters\nonly. For the transposition of two letters through five places will\nyield thirty-two differences; much more twenty-four, which is the number\nof letters in our Alphabet. Here is an example of such an Alphabet.\n\n    A     B     C     D     E     F     G     H\n  aaaaa aaaab aaaba aaabb aabaa aabab aabba aabbb\n\n    I     K     L     M     N     O     P     Q\n  abaaa abaab ababa ababb abbaa abbab abbba abbbb\n\n    R     S     T     V     W     X     Y     Z\n  baaaa baaab baaba baabb babaa babab babba babbb\n\n\"Nor is it a slight thing which is thus by the way effected. For heare\nwe see how thoughts may be communicated at any distance of place by\nmeans of any objects perceptible either to the eye or ear, provided\nonly that those objects are capable of two differences; as by bells,\ntrumpets, torches, gunshots, and the like. But to proceed with our\nbusiness. When you prepare to write, you must reduce the interior\nepistle to this bi-literal alphabet. Let the interior epistle be:\n\n           Fly.\n  Example of reduction.\n      F     L     Y\n    aabab ababa babba\n\n\"Have by you at the same time another alphabet in two forms; I mean in\nwhich each of the letters of the common alphabet, both capitals and\nsmall, are exhibited in two different forms,--any forms that you find\nconvenient.\"\n\n[For instance, Roman and Italic letters; \"a\" representing Roman and \"b\"\nrepresenting Italic.]\n\n\"Then take your interior epistle, reduced to the bi-literal shape, and\nadapt it, letter by letter, to your exterior epistle in the biform\ncharacter; and then write it out. Let the exterior epistle be:\n\n        \"Do not go till I come.\"\n          Example of reduction\n             F     L     Y\n           aabab ababa babba\n  DO_N_O_T_  G_O_T_I_L  _L_I_CO_M--_E_\n     do not     go till      I come\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFrom the above given dates it would almost seem as if Bacon had treated\nthe matter in a purely academic manner, and had drawn out of his\nremembrance of his younger days a method of secret communication which\nhad not seen any practical service. Spedding mentions in his book\n\"Francis Bacon and his Times\" that Bacon may have got the hint of the\n'bi-literal cypher' from the work of John Baptist Porta, \"De occultis\nliterarum notis,\" reprinted in Strasburg in 1606, but the first edition\nof which was published when Porta was a young man. It is however\nmanifest from certain evidence, that Bacon practised his special cipher\nand used it for many years. Lady Bacon, mother of the philosopher,\nwriting in 1593, to her son Anthony, elder brother of Francis, speaking\nof him, Francis, says, \"I do not understand his enigmatical folded\nwriting.\" Indeed it is possible that many years before he had tried to\nhave his invention made use of for public service. His was an age of\nsecret writing. Every Ambassador had to send his despatches in cipher,\nfor thus--and even then not always--could they be safe from hostile\neyes. The thousands of pages of reports to King Philip made by Don\nBernardino de Mendoza, the Spanish Ambassador at the Court of Queen\nElizabeth, before the time of the Armada, were all written in this form;\nthe groaning shelves of the records at Simancas bear evidence of the\nindustry of such political officials and of their spies and secretaries.\nAn ambitious youth like Francis Bacon, son of the Lord Keeper, and so\ntraditionally and familiarly in touch with Court and Council, who in his\nbaby days was addressed by Elizabeth as her \"young Lord Keeper,\" and who\nspent the time between his sixteenth and eighteenth years in the suite\nof the English Ambassador in Paris, Sir Amyas Paulet, must have had\nconstant experience of the need of a cipher which would fulfill the\nconditions which he laid down as essential in 1605--facility of\nexecution, impossibility of discovery, and lack of suspiciousness. When,\nin a letter of 16 Sept. 1580, to his uncle Lord Burghley, he made suit\nto the Queen for some special employment, it is possible that the post\nhe sought was that of secret writer to Her Majesty. His letter, though\nfollowed up with a more pressing one on 18th October of the same year,\nremained unanswered. Whatever the motive or purpose of these last two\nletters may have been, it remained on his mind; for eleven years later\nwe find him again writing to his uncle the Lord Keeper: \"I ever have a\nmind to serve Her Majesty,\" and again, \"the meanness of my estate doth\nsomewhat move me.\" In the interval, on 25th August, 1585, he wrote to\nthe Right Hon. Sir Francis Walsingham, Principal Secretary to the Queen:\n\"In default of getting it, will go back to course of practice (at Bar) I\nmust and will follow, not for my necessity of estate but for my credit's\nsake, which I fear by being out of action will wear.\" His brother\nAnthony spent the best part of his life abroad, presumably on some\nsecret missions; and as Francis was the recipient of his letters it was\ndoubtless that \"folded writing\" which so puzzled their mother which was\nused for the safety and secrecy of their correspondence. Indeed to what\na fine point the biliteral method must have been brought by Bacon and\nhis correspondents is shown by the extraordinarily minute differences\ngiven in his own setting forth of the symbols for \"a\" and \"b\" etc., in\nthe \"_De Augmentis_\" of 1623 and later. In the edition printed in Latin\nin Paris the next year, 1624, by Peter Mettayer, the differences,\npossibly through some imperfection of printing, are so minute that\neven the reader studying the characters set before him, with the extra\nelucidation of their being placed under their proper headings, finds it\nalmost impossible to understand them. The cutting for instance of the\n\"n\" which represents \"a\" and that which represents \"b\" seems, even after\nprolonged study, to be the same.\n\nIt is to be noticed that Bacon in setting forth the cipher in its\ncompleteness directs attention to its infinite possibilities and\nvariations. The organised repetition of any two symbols in combinations\nof not more than five for one or both symbols may convey ideas. Not\nletters only but colours, bells, cannon, or other sounds may be used\nwith effect. All the senses may be employed, or any or some of them, in\nendless combinations.\n\nAgain it is to be noted that even in his first allusion to the system in\n1605, he says, \"to write Omnia per Omnia, which is undoubtedly possible,\nwith a proportion _Quintuple at most_, of the writing infoulding, to the\nwriting infoulded.\"\n\n\"Quintuple at most!\" But in the instances of his system which he gives\neighteen years later, when probably his time for secret writing as a\nmatter of business had ceased, and when from the lofty altitude of\nthe Woolsack he could behold unmoved any who had concealments to\nmake--provided of course that they were not connected with bribes--there\nis only one method given, that of five infolding letters for each one\ninfolded. In the later and fuller period he speaks also of the one\nnecessary condition \"that the infoulding writing shall contain _at least\nfive times as many letters_ as the writing infoulded\"--\n\nEven in the example which he gives \"Do not go till I come,\" there is a\nsuperfluous letter,--the final \"e;\" as though he wished to mislead the\nreader by inference as well as by direct statement.\n\nIs it possible that he stopped short in his completion of this\nmarvellous cipher? Can we believe that he who openly spoke from the\nfirst of symbols \"_quintuple at most_,\" was content to use so large a\nnumber of infolding letters when he could possibly do with less? Why,\nthe last condition of excellence in a cipher which he himself laid down,\nnamely, that it should \"bee without suspicion,\" would be endangered by\na larger number than was actually necessary. It is by repetition of\nsymbols that the discovery of secret writing is made; and in a cipher\nwhere, manifestly, the eye or the ear or the touch or the taste must be\nguided by such, and so marked and prolonged, symbols, the chances of\ndiscovery are enormously increased. Doubtless, then, he did not rest in\nhis investigation and invention until he had brought his cipher to its\nleast dimensions; and it was for some other reason or purpose that\nhe thus tried to divert the mind of the student from his earlier\nsuggestion. It will probably be proved hereafter that more than one\nvariant and reduction to lower dimensions of his biliteral cipher was\nused between himself and his friends. When the secrets of that\n\"Scrivenry\" which, according to Mr. W.\u00c2\u00a0G. Thorpe in his interesting\nvolume, \"The Hidden Lives of Shakespeare and Bacon,\" Bacon kept at work\nin Twickenham Park, are made known, we shall doubtless know more on the\nsubject. Of one point, however, we may rest assured, that Bacon did not\ngo back in his pursuance of an interesting study; and the change from\n\"Quintuple at most\" of the infolding writing of 1605, to \"Quintuple\nat least,\" of 1623, was meant for some purpose of misleading or\nobscuration, rather than as a limitation of his original setting forth\nof the powers and possibilities of his great invention. It will some\nday be an interesting theme of speculation and study what use of his\nbiliteral cipher had been made between 1605 and 1623; and what it was\nthat he wished to conceal.\n\nThat the original cipher, as given, can be so reduced is manifest. Of\nthe Quintuple biliteral there are thirty-two combinations. As in the\nElizabethan alphabet, as Bacon himself points out, there were but\ntwenty-four letters, certain possibilities of reduction at once unfold\nthemselves, since at the very outset one entire fourth of the symbols\nare unused.\n\n\n\n\nAPPENDIX B\n\nON THE REDUCTION OF THE NUMBER OF SYMBOLS IN BACON'S BILITERAL CIPHER\n\n\nWhen I examined the scripts together, both that of the numbers and those\nof the dots, I found distinct repetitions of groups of symbols; but no\ncombinations sufficiently recurrent to allow me to deal with them as\nentities. In the number cipher the class of repetitions seemed more\nmarked. This may have been, however, that as the symbols were simpler\nand of a kind with which I was more familiar, the traces or surmises\nwere easier to follow. It gave me hope to find that there was something\nin common between the two methods. It might be, indeed, that both\nwritings were but variants of the same system. Unconsciously I gave my\nattention to the simpler form--the numbers--and for a long weary time\nwent over them forward, backward, up and down, adding, subtracting,\nmultiplying, dividing; but without any favorable result. The only\nencouragement which I got was that I got additions of eight and nine,\neach of these many times repeated. Try how I would, however, I could not\nscheme out of them any coherent result.\n\nWhen in desperation I returned to the dotted papers I found that this\nmethod was still more exasperating, for on a close study of them I could\nnot fail to see that there was a cipher manifest; though what it was, or\nhow it could be read, seemed impossible to me. Most of the letters had\nmarks in or about them; indeed there were very few which had not.\nExamining more closely still I found that the dots were disposed in\nthree different ways: (a) in the body of the letter itself: (b) above\nthe letter: (c) below it. There was never more than one mark in the\nbody of the letter; but those above or below were sometimes single and\nsometimes double. Some letters had only the dot in the body; and others,\nwhether marked on the body or not, had no dots either above or below.\nThus there was every form and circumstance of marking within these three\ncategories. The only thing which my instinct seemed to impress upon me\ncontinually was that very few of the letters had marks both above and\nbelow. In such cases two were above and one below, or _vice versa_; but\nin no case were there marks in the body and above and below also. At\nlast I came to the conclusion that I had better, for the time, abandon\nattempting to decipher; and try to construct a cipher on the lines of\nBacon's Biliteral--one which would ultimately accord in some way with\nthe external conditions of either, or both, of those before me.\n\nBut Bacon's Biliteral as set forth in the _Novum Organum_ had five\nsymbols in every case. As there were here no repetitions of five, I set\nmyself to the task of reducing Bacon's system to a lower number of\nsymbols--a task which in my original memorandum I had held capable of\naccomplishment.\n\nFor hours I tried various means of reduction, each time getting a little\nnearer to the ultimate simplicity; till at last I felt that I had\nmastered the principle.\n\nTake the Baconian biliteral cipher as he himself gives it and knock out\nrepetitions of four or five aaaaa: aaaab: abbbb: baaaa: bbbba: and\nbbbbb. This would leave a complete alphabet with two extra symbols for\nuse as stops, repeats, capitals, etc. This method of deletion, however,\nwould not allow of the reduction of the number of symbols used; there\nwould still be required five for each letter to be infolded. We have\ntherefore to try another process of reduction, that affecting the\nvariety of symbols without reference to the number of times, up to five,\nwhich each one is repeated.\n\nTake therefore the Baconian Biliteral and place opposite to each item\nthe number of symbols required. The first, (aaaaa) requires but one\nsymbol \"a,\" the second, (aaaab) two, \"a\" and \"b;\" the third (aaaba)\nthree, \"a\" \"b\" and \"a;\" and so on. We shall thus find that the 11th\n(ababa) and the 22nd (babab) require five each, and that the 6th, 10th,\n12th, 14th, 19th, 21st, 23rd and 27th require four each. If, therefore,\nwe delete all these biliteral combinations which require four or five\nsymbols each--ten in all--we have still left twenty-two combinations,\nnecessitating at most not more than two changes of symbol in addition to\nthe initial letter of each, requiring up to five quantities of the same\nsymbol. Fit these to the alphabet; and the scheme of cipher is complete.\n\nIf, therefore, we can devise any means of expressing, in conjunction\nwith each symbol, a certain number of repeats up to five; and if we can,\nfor practical purposes, reduce our alphabet to twenty-two letters,\nwe can at once reduce the biliteral cipher to three instead of five\nsymbols.\n\nThe latter is easy enough, for certain letters are so infrequently used\nthat they may well be grouped in twos. Take \"X\" and \"Z\" for instance.\nIn modern printing in English where the letter \"e\" is employed seventy\ntimes, \"x\" is only used three times, and \"z\" twice. Again, \"k\" is only\nused six times, and \"q\" only three times. Therefore we may very well\ngroup together \"k\" and \"q,\" and \"x\" and \"z.\" The lessening of the\nElizabethan alphabet thus effected would leave but twenty-two letters,\nthe same number as the combinations of the biliteral remaining after\nthe elision. And further, as \"W\" is but \"V\" repeated, we could keep a\nspecial symbol to represent the repetition of this or any other letter,\nwhether the same be in the body of a word, or if it be the last of\none word and the first of that which follows. Thus we give a greater\nelasticity to the cipher and so minimise the chance of discovery.\n\nAs to the expression of numerical values applied to each of the\nsymbols \"a\" and \"b\" of the biliteral cipher as above modified, such\nis simplicity itself in a number cipher. As there are two symbols\nto be represented and five values to each--four in addition to the\ninitial--take the numerals, one to ten--which latter, of course, could\nbe represented by 0. Let the odd numbers according to their values stand\nfor \"a\":\n\n      a=1\n     aa=3\n    aaa=5\n   aaaa=7\n  aaaaa=9\n\nand the even numbers according to their values stand for \"b\":\n\n      b=2\n     bb=4\n    bbb=6\n   bbbb=8\n  bbbbb=0\n\nand then? Eureka! We have a Biliteral Cipher in which each letter is\nrepresented by one, two, or three, numbers; and so the five symbols of\nthe Baconian Biliteral is reduced to three at maximum.\n\nVariants of this scheme can of course, with a little ingenuity, be\neasily reconstructed.\n\n\n\n\nAPPENDIX C\n\nTHE RESOLVING OF BACON'S BILITERAL REDUCED TO THREE SYMBOLS IN A NUMBER\nCIPHER\n\n\nPlace in their relative order as appearing in the original arrangement\nthe selected symbols of the Biliteral:\n\n  a a a a a\n  a a a a b\n      &c\n\nThen place opposite each the number arrived at by the application of odd\nand even figures to represent the numerical values of the symbols \"a\"\nand \"b.\"\n\n  Thus aaaaa will be as shown 9\n       aaaab will be as shown 72\n       aaaba will be as shown 521\n\nand so on. Then put in sequence of numerical value. We shall then have:\n0. 9. 18. 27. 36. 45. 54. 63. 72. 81. 125. 143. 161. 216. 234. 252. 323.\n341. 414. 432. 521. 612. An analysis shows that of these there are two\nof one figure; eight of two figures; and twelve of three figures. Now\nas regards the latter series--the symbols composed of three figures--we\nwill find that if we add together the component figures of each of those\nwhich begins and ends with an even number they will tot up to nine;\nbut that the total of each of those commencing and ending with an odd\nnumber only total up to eight. There are no two of these symbols which\nclash with one another so as to cause confusion.\n\nTo fit the alphabet to this cipher the simplest plan is to reserve one\nsymbol (the first--\"0\") to represent the repetition of a foregoing\nletter. This would not only enlarge possibilities of writing, but would\nhelp to baffle inquiry. There is a distinct purpose in choosing \"0\" as\nthe symbol of repetition for it can best be spared; it would invite\ncuriosity to begin a number cipher with \"0,\" were it in use in any\ncombination of figures representing a letter.\n\nKeep all the other numbers and combinations of numbers for purely\nalphabetical use. Then take the next five--9 to 45 to represent the\nvowels. The rest of the alphabet can follow in regular sequence, using\nup of the triple combinations, first those beginning and ending with\neven numbers and which tot up to nine, and when these have been\nexhausted, the others, those beginning and ending with odd numbers and\nwhich tot up to eight, in their own sequence.\n\nIf this plan be adopted, any letter of a word can be translated into\nnumbers which are easily distinguishable, and whose sequence can be\nseemingly altered, so as to baffle inquisitive eyes, by the addition of\nany other numbers placed anywhere throughout the cipher. All of these\nadded numbers can easily be discovered and eliminated by the scribe who\nundertakes the work of decipheration, by means of the additions of odd\nor even numbers, or by reference to his key. The whole cipher is so\nrationally exact that any one who knows the principle can make a key in\na few minutes.\n\nAs I had gone on with my work I was much cheered by certain resemblances\nor coincidences which presented themselves, linking my new construction\nwith the existing cipher. When I hit upon the values of additions of\neight and nine as the component elements of some of the symbols, I felt\nsure that I was now on the right track. At the completion of my work I\nwas exultant for I felt satisfied in believing that the game was now in\nmy own hands.\n\n\n\n\nAPPENDIX D\n\nON THE APPLICATION OF THE NUMBER CIPHER TO THE DOTTED PRINTING\n\n\nThe problem which I now put before myself was to make dots in a printed\nbook in which I could repeat accurately and simply the setting forth\nof the biliteral cipher. I had, of course, a clue or guiding principle\nin the combinations of numbers with the symbols of \"a\" and \"b\" as\nrepresenting the Alphabetical symbols. Thus it was easy to arrange that\n\"a\" should be represented by a letter untouched and \"b\" by one with\na mark. This mark might be made at any point of the letter. Here I\nreferred to the cipher itself and found that though some letters were\nmarked with a dot in the centre or body of the letter, those both above\nand below wherever they occurred showed some kind of organised use. \"Why\nnot,\" said I to myself, \"use the body for the difference between \"a\" and\n\"b;\" and the top and bottom for numbers?\"\n\nNo sooner said than done. I began at once to devise various ways of\nrepresenting numbers by marks or dots at top and bottom. Finally I\nfixed, as being the most simple, on the following:\n\nOnly four numbers--2, 3, 4, 5--are required to make the number of times\neach letter of the symbol is repeated, there being in the original\nBaconian cipher, after the elimination of the ten variations already\nmade, only three changes of symbol to represent any letter. Marks at the\ntop might therefore represent the even numbers \"2\" and \"4\"--one mark\nstanding for \"two\" and two marks for \"four\"; marks at the bottom would\nrepresent the odd numbers \"3\" and \"5\"--one mark standing for \"three\" and\ntwo marks for \"five.\"\n\nThus \"a a a a a\" would be represented by \"a\u00cc\u00a4\" or any other letter with\ntwo dots below: \"a a a a b\" by \u00c3\u00a4 b, or any other letters similarly\ntreated. As any letter left plain would represent \"a\" and any letter\ndotted in the body would represent \"b\" the cipher is complete for\napplication to any printed or written matter. As in the number cipher,\nthe repetition of a letter could be represented by a symbol which in\nthis variant would be the same as the symbol for ten or \"0.\" It would be\nany letter with one dot in the body and two under it, thus--t\u00cc\u00ba.\n\nFor the purpose of adding to the difficulty of discovery, where two\nmarks were given either above or below the letter, the body mark\n(representing the letter as \"b\" in the Biliteral) might be placed at the\nopposite end. This would create no confusion in the mind of an advised\ndecipherer, but would puzzle the curious.\n\nOn the above basis I completed my key and set to my work of deciphering\nwith a jubilant heart; for I felt that so soon as I should have adjusted\nany variations between the systems of the old writer and my own, work\nonly was required to ultimately master the secret.\n\n\nThe following tables will illustrate the making and working--both in\nciphering and de-ciphering--of the amended Biliteral Cipher of Francis\nBacon:\n\n\nCIPHER FOR NUMBERS AND DOTS.\n\n  P (Plain) means letter left untouched\n  D (Dot) means letter with dot in body\n  One Dot--(.) at Top (t)--_2\n  One Dot--(.) at Bottom (b)--_3\n  Two Dots--(..) at Top (t)--_4\n  Two Dots--(..) at Bottom (b)--_5\n\n  ================+==========+============+==========+=================\n                  |          |  NUMBER    |          |\n                  |          |  CIPHER.   |          |\n                  |  No. of  +------------+ Alphabet |\n   BACON CIPHER.  | Symbols  | No. Values |   to be  |  DOT CIPHER\n                  | Required |    of      | arranged |\n                  |          |  Symbols   | in order.|\n                  |          | reported.  |          |\n  ----------------+----------+------------+----------+-----------------\n  A-- 1--a a a a a|  --1--   | 9          | --A      | --P..b\n  B-- 2--a a a a b|  --2--   | 7.2        | --D      | --P..t--D\n  C-- 3--a a a b a|  --3--   | 5.2.1      | --Y      | --P .b--D--P\n  D-- 4--a a a b b|  --2--   | 5.4        | --B      | --P .b--D.t\n  E-- 5--a a b a a|  --3--   | 3.2.3      | --T      | --P .t--D--P.t\n  F-- 6--a a b a b|  --4--   | 3.2.1.2    |          |\n  G-- 7--a a b b a|  --3--   | 3.4.1      | --X.Z.   | --P .t--D.t--P\n  H-- 8--a a b b b|  --2--   | 3.6        | --O      | --P .t--D.b\n  I-- 9--a b a a a|  --3--   | 1.2.5      | --P      | --P--D--P.b\n  K--10--a b a a b|  --4--   | 1.3.3.2    |          |\n  L--11--a b a b a|  --5--   | 1.2.1.2.1  |          |\n  M--12--a b a b b|  --4--   | 1.2.1.4    |          |\n  N--13--a b b a a|  --3--   | 1.4.3      | --R      | --P--D .t--P.t\n  O--14--a b b a b|  --4--   | 1.4.1.2    |          |\n  P--15--a b b b a|  --3--   | 1.6.1      | --S      | --P--D .b--P\n  Q--16--a b b b b|  --2--   | 1.8        | --E      | --P--D..t\n  R--17--b a a a a|  --2--   | 2.7        | --I      | --D--P..t\n  S--18--b a a a b|  --3--   | 2.5.2      | --K.Q.   | --D--P .b--D\n  T--19--b a a b a|  --4--   | 2.3.2.1    |          |\n  V--20--b a a b b|  --3--   | 2.3.4      | --H      | --D--P .t--D.t\n  W--21--b a b a a|  --4--   | 2.1.2.3    |          |\n  X--22--b a b a b|  --5--   | 2.1.2.1.2  |          |\n  Y--23--b a b b a|  --4--   | 2.1.4.1    |          |\n  Z--24--b a b b b|  --3--   | 2.1.6      | --G      | --D--P--D.b\n     25--b b a a a|  --2--   | 4.5        | --U.V.   | --D.t--P.b\n     26--b b a a b|  --3--   | 4.3.2      | --M      | --D.t--P.t--D\n     27--b b a b a|  --4--   | 4.1.2.1    |          |\n     28--b b a b b|  --3--   | 4.1.4      | --L      | --D .t--P--D.t\n     29--b b b a a|  --2--   | 6.3        | --C      | --D .b--P.t\n     30--b b b a b|  --3--   | 6.1.2      | --N      | --D .b--P--D\n     31--b b b b a|  --2--   | 8.1        | --F      | --D..t--P\n     32--b b b b b|  --1--   | 9          | --Repeat | --D..b\n  ================+==========+============+==========+=================\n\nNOTE.--When there are to be two dots at either top or bottom of a\nletter, the dot usually put in the body of a letter which is to indicate\n\"b\" can be placed at the opposite end of the letter to the double\ndotting.

I went at once and found that\nthough the carriage of his great office had somewhat aged my kinsman\nit had not changed the sweet bearing which he had ever had towards me.\nHe entered at once on the matter regarding which he had summoned me,\nleaving to later those matters of home and family which were close to us\nboth, and prefacing his speech with an assurance--unnecessary I enforced\non him--that he would not have urged me to so great a voyage, and at a\ntime when the concerns of home and of His Catholic Majesty so needed me\nin my own place, had there not been strictest need of my presence at\nRome. This he then explained, ever anticipating my ignorance, so lucidly\nand with sweet observance of my needs, that I could not wonder at his\ngreat advancement.\n\nEntering at once on the enterprise of the King as to the restoration of\nEngland to the fold of the True Church he made clear to me that the one\ngreat wish of His Holinesse was to aid in all ways the achievement of\nthe same. To such end he was willing to devote a vast treasure, the\nwhich he had accumulated for the purpose through many years. \"But\" said\nmy kinsman, and with so much smiling as might become his grave office\n\"the King hath here at the Court of Rome one to represent him, who,\nthough doubtless a zealous and faithful servant of his Royal Master,\nhath not those qualities of discretion and discernment, of the\nsubjugation of self and the discipline of his own ideas, which go to\nmake up the perfection of the Ambassador. He hath already many times and\nin many ways, to many persons and in many Countries, said of His\nHolinesse such things as, even if true--and they are not so--were, in\nthe high discretion of his office as Ambassador, better unspoken. This,\nmoreover, in an Embassy wherein he wishes to acquire much which the\nmundane world holds to be of great worth. The Count de Olivares hath\nspoken freely and without reserve of the Holy Father's reticence in\nhanding over vast sums of money to His Catholic Majesty as due to\nparsimony, to avarice, to meanness of spirit, and to other low qualities\nwhich, though common enough in men, are soil to the name of God's\nVicegerent on Earth! Nay\" he went on, seeing that my horror was such as\nto verge on doubt, \"trust me in this, for of the verity of these things\nI am assured. Rome hath many eyes, and the hearing of her ears is\nwidecast. The Pope and his Cardinals are well served throughout the\nworld. Little indeed happens in Christendom--aye and beyond it--which is\nnot echoed in secret in the Vatican. I know that not only has Count de\nOlivares spoken of his beliefs regarding the Holy Father to his mundane\nfriends, but he has not hesitated in his formal despatches to say the\nsame to his Royal Master. It hath grieved His Holinesse much that any\ncould so misunderstand him, and it hath grieved him more that His\nCatholic Majesty should receive such calumnies without demur. Wherefore\nhe would take some other means than the hand of the King of Spain to\naccomplish his own secret ends. He knoweth well the high purpose of His\nCatholic Majesty, your Royal Master, in the restoration of England\nto the True Faith; but yet his mind is much disturbed by his recent\npronouncements regarding the Bishoprics. The See of Rome is the Arch\nEpiscopate of the Earth, and to its Bishop belongs by God's very\nordinance the ruling of all the bishoprics of the Church. \"Upon this\nRock shall I build my Church.\" Now His Holinesse hath already promised\na million crowns towards the great emprise of the Armada; and he hath\npromised it so that it be handed over to the King when his emprise,\nwhich is after all for the enlargement of his own kingdom, hath begun to\nbear fruit. But Count de Olivares is not content with this promise--the\npromise remember of God's Vicegerent--and he is ever clamorous, not only\nfor the immediate payment of this promised sum, but for other sums. His\nnew request is for another million crowns. And even in the very presence\nof His Holinesse, he so bears himself as if the non-compliance with his\ndemand were a wrong to him and to his Master. From all which His\nHolinesse, consulting in privacy with me who am also his friend--such is\nthe greatness with which he honoureth me--hath determined that, whereas\nhe will of course keep to the last letter his promise of help, and will\neven exceed largely the same, he will dispose in other ways of the great\ntreasure which he had already set aside for this English affair. When he\nhonoured me by asking my advice as to whom should be entrusted with this\nhigh endeavour, and had shown that of necessity it should be some\nSpaniard so that hereafter it might not be said that the emprise of the\nArmada had not his full sanction and support, I ventured to suggest that\nin you first of all men this high trust should be reposed. For yourself,\nI said that I had known you from childhood, and had found you without\na flaw; and that you came from a race that had gone clothed in honour\nsince the time of the Moors.\"\n\nMuch other of like kind, my children, did my kinsman tell me that he had\nsaid to His Holinesse; which so satisfied him that he had commanded him\nto send for me so that he could have the assurance of his own seeing\nwhat manner of man I was. My kinsman then went on to tell me how he had\ntold His Holinesse of what I had already taken in hand regarding the\nGreat Armada. How I had promised the King a galleon fully equipped and\nmanned with seamen and soldiers from our old Castile; and how His\nMajesty was so pleased, since my offer had been the first he had\nreceived, that he had sworn that my vessel should carry the flag of the\nsquadron of the galleons of Castile. He told him also that the galleon\nwas to be called the _San Cristobal_ from my patron saint; and also that\nso her figurehead should bear the image of the Christ into English\nwaters the first of all things that came from my Province. Which idea so\nwrought upon the mind of His Holinesse that he said: \"Good man! Good\nSpaniard! Good Christian! I shall provide the figurehead for the _San\nCristobal_ myself. When Don de Escoban comes here I shall arrange it\nwith him.\"\n\nWhen my kinsman had so informed me as to many things he left me a while,\nsaying that he would ask the Pope to arrange for an audience with me.\nShortly he returned with haste, saying that the Holy Father wished me to\ncome to him at once. I went in exaltation mingled with fear; and all my\nunworthiness of such high honour rose before me. But when I came to His\nHolinesse and knelt before him he blessed me and raised me up himself.\nAnd when he bade me, I raised my eyes and looked at him in the face.\nWhereat he turned to the Spanish Cardinal and said: \"You have spoken\nunder the mark, my brother. Here is a man indeed in whom I can trust to\nthe full.\"\n\nAnd so, my children, he made me sit by him, and for a long time--it was\nmore than two hours by the clock--he talked with me about his wish. And,\noh my children, I would that you and others could hear the wise words of\nthat great and good man. He was so worldly-wise, in addition to his\nSaintly wisdom, that nothing seemed to lack in his reasoning; nothing\nwas too small to be outside his understanding and considerations of the\nmotives and arts of men. He told me with exceeding frankness of his\nviews of the situation. All the while, my kinsman smiled and nodded\napproval now and again; and it filled me with pride that one of my own\nblood should stand so close to the counsels of His Holinesse. He told\nme that though war was a sad necessity, which he as himself an earthly\nmonarch was compelled to understand and accept, yet he preferred\ninfinitely the ways of peace; and moreover believed in them. In his own\nwise words, \"the logic of the cannon, though more loud, speaks not so\nforcibly as the logic of the living day between sunrise and sunset.\"\nWhen later he added to this conviction that, \"the chink of the money-bag\nspeaks more loudly than either,\" I ventured an impulsive word of\nprotest. Whereupon he stopped and looking at me sharply asked if I knew\nhow to bribe. To which I replied that as yet I had given none, nor taken\nnone. Then smilingly he laid his hand in friendlinesse on my shoulder\nand said: \"My friend, Saint Escoban, these be two things, not one; and\nthough to take a bribe is to be unforgiven, yet to give one at high\ncommand is but a duty, like the soldier's duty to kill which is not\nmurder, which it would be without such behest.\" Then raising his hand\nto silence my protest he said: \"I know what you would say: 'Woe to that\nman by whom the scandal cometh,' but such argument, my friend, is my\nprovince; and its responsibility is mine. Ere you proceed on your\nmission you shall have indemnity for the carriage of all my commands.\nYou go into an enemy's country; a country which is the professed and\nmalignant enemy of Holy Church, and where faith and honour are not.\nGod's work is to be done in many ways. It is sufficient that He has\nallowed instruments that are unworthy and unholy; and as unworthy and\nunholy we must use them to His ends. You, Don de Escoban, shall have no\npain in such matters, and no shame. My commands shall cover you!\"\nThen, when I had bowed my recognition of his will, he resumed his\ninstructions. He said that in England in high places were many men who\nwere open to sell their knowledge or their power, and that when once\nthey had accepted payment it were needful for their own credit and\neven for their safety, that they should further the end which they had\nundertaken. \"These English,\" he said, \"are pagans; and it was said of\nthis our Holy City in pagan times '_Omnia Romae venalia sunt!_'\"\nWhereupon there was borne upon me a recollection of years before when I\nwas in the suite of the Ambassador at Paris, how a boy in the British\nEmbassy who was shewing me a cipher of encloased writing which he\nhad just perfected had written in it with uncouth lettering as an\nillustration \"_Omnia Britaniae venalia sunt_.\" And further did remember\nhow we had enlarged and perfected the cipher when we resided together at\nTours. His Holinesse told me that in great seasons it were needful to\nscatter favours with a lavish hand, and that no season was or could be\nso great as that which foreran the restoring to the fold a great and\nactive nation who was already beginning to rule the seas. \"To which\nend,\" he said, \"I am placing with you a vastness of treasure such as\nno nation hath ever seen. The gifts of the Faithful have begun it\nand enlarged it; and the fruits of many victories have enhanced it.\nRegarding it, there is only one promise which I will exact from you,\nand that I shall exact in the most solemn way of which the Church has\nknowledge; that this vast treasure be applied to onely that purpose to\nwhich it is ordained--the advancement of the True Faith. It will add\nalso, of course, to the honour and glory of the Kingdom of Spain, so\nthat for all time the world may know that the comfort of the Roman See\nis on the emprise of the Great Armada! In proof of which should, for the\nsins of men, the great emprise fail, you or those who may succeed you in\nthe Trust are, if I myself be not then living, to hand the Treasure to\nthe custody of whatever monarch may then sit upon the throne of Spain\nfor his good guardianship, in trust with me.\"\n\nSo he proceeded to detail; and gave full instructions as to the amount\nof the treasure. How it was to be placed in my hands, and when; and all\ndetails of its using when the Armada should have made landing on English\nshores. And how I should use it myself, in case I were not told to hand\nit over to some other. If I were to yield up the treasure, the mandate\nshould be enforced by letter, together with the showing of a ring, which\nhe took from the purse where he kept the Fisherman's ring wherewith he\nsigns all briefs, and allowed me to examine it so that I might recognize\nit if shown to me hereafter. All of which things of using are not now\nof importance to you, my children, for the time of their usefulness has\npassed by; but only to show that the treasure is to be guarded, and\nfinally given to the custody of the King of Spain.\n\nThen His Holiness spoke to me of my own vessel. He promised me that a\nsuitable figurehead, one wrought for his own galley by the great\nBenvenuto Cellini, and blessed by Himself, should be duly sent on to me.\nHe promised also that the Quittance to me and mine, which he had named\nshould be completed and lodged in the secret archives of the Papacy.\nThen once more he blessed me, and on parting gave me a relic of San\nCristobal, whose possession, together with the honour done me, made me\nfeel as I left the Vatican as though I walked upon air.\n\nOn my return to Spain I visited the ship yard at San Lucar, where\nalready the building of the _San Cristobal_ was in progress. I arranged\nin private with the master builder that there should be constructed in\nthe centre of the galleon a secret chamber, well encased round with teak\nwood from the Indies, and with enforcement of steel plates; and with\na lock to the iron door, such as Pedro the Venetian hath already\nconstructed for the treasure chest of the King. By my suggestion,\nand his wisdom in the doing of the matter, the secret chamber was so\narranged in disposition, and so masked in with garniture of seeming\nunimportance, that none, unless of the informed, might tell its\npresence, or indeed of its very existence. It was placed as though in a\nwell of teak wood and steel, hemmed in on all sides; without entrance\nwhatever from the lower parts, and only approachable from the top which\nlay under my own cabin, down deep in the centre of the galleon. Men in\nsingle and detachments, were brought from other ship yards for the doing\nof this work, and all so disposed in Port that none might have greater\nknowledge than of that item which he completed at the time. Save only\nthose few of the guilds whose faith had long been made manifest by their\nrectitude of life and their discretion of silence.\n\nInto this secret receptacle (to continue this narrative out of its due\nsequence) when the final outfitting of the Invincible Armada came to\npass, was placed, under my own supervision, in the night time and in\nsecret, all the vast treasure which had before then been sent to me\nsecretly by agents of His Holinesse. Full tally and reckoning made I\nwith my own hand, nominating the coined money by its value in crowns and\ndoubloons, and the gold and silver in bullion by their weight. I made\na list in separate also of the endless array of precious stones, both\nthose enriched in carvings and inriching the jewells of gold and silver\nwrought by the cunning of the great artizans. I made list also of the\ngems unplanted, which were of innumerable number and of various bigness.\nThese latter I specified by kind and number, singling out some of rare\nsize and quality for description. The whole table of the list I signed\nand sent by his messengers to the Pope, specifying thereon that I had\nthem in trust for His Holinesse to dispose of them as he might direct;\nor to yield over to whomsoever he might depute to receive them whenever\nand wherever they might be in the guardianship of me or mine, the order\nof His Holinesse being verified by the exhibition by the new trustee of\nthe Eagle Ring.\n\nBefore the _San Cristobal_ had left San Lucar, there arrived from Rome,\nin a package of great bulk--brought by a ship accredited by the Pope, so\nthat corsairs other than Turks and pagans might respect the flag, and so\nabstain from plunder--the figurehead of the galleon which His Holinesse\nhad promised to supply. With it came a sealed missive cautioning me that\nI should open the package in privacy, and deal with its contents only\nby means of those in whom I had full trust, since it was even in its\nsubstance most precious. In addition to which it had been specially\nwrought by Benvenuto Cellini, the Master goldsmith whose work was\ncontended for by the Kings of the earth. It was the wish of His\nHolinesse himself that on the conversion of England being completed,\neither through peace or war, this figurehead of the _San Cristobal_\nshould be set over the High Altar of the Cathedral at Westminster, where\nit would serve for all time of an emblem of the love of the Pope for the\nwellbeing of the souls of his English children.\n\nI opened the case with only present a chosen few; and truly we were\nwonderstruck with the beauty and richness of the jewell, for it was none\nother, which was discloased to us. The great figure of San Cristobal was\nsilver gilded to look like gold, and of such thickness that the hollow\nwithin rang sweetly at a touch as though a bell sounded there. But the\nFigure of the child Christ which he bore upon his shoulder was of none\nother than solid gold. When we who were present saw it, we sank to our\nknees in gratitude for so great a tribute of Holinesse, and also the\nbeauty of the tribute to the Divine Excellence. Truly the kindness of\nthe Pope and the zeal of his artist were without bound; for with the\nfigurehead came a jewell made in the form of a brooch carven in gold\nwhich represented it _in petto_. It was known to all the Squadron that\nthe Pope himself had sent the figurehead of the _San Cristobal_; and as\nour vessel moved along the line of galleons and ships, and hulks, and\npataches, and galleys of the Armada, the heads of all were uncovered and\nthe knees of all were bent. We had not any christening of the galleon,\nfor the blessing of the Holy Father was already on the figurehead of the\nship and encompassed it round about.\n\nNone knew on board the _San Cristobal_ of the existence of the treasure,\nsave only the Captain of the galleons and ships, and hulks, and\npataches, and galleys of the Squadron of Castile, to both of whom I\nentrusted the secret of the treasure (though not the giver nor the\nnature of the Trust nor the amount thereof), lest ill should befall me,\nand in ignorance the whole through some disaster be lost. And let me\nhere say to their honour that my confidence was kept faithfully to the\nlast; though it may be that had they known the magnitude of the treasure\nit might have been otherwise, men being but as flax before the fire of\ncupidity.\n\nFor myself after I embarked, I went on the journey with mixed feelings;\nfor my body unaccustomed to the sea warred mightily with my soul that\nhad full trust in the enterprise. The many days of storm and trial after\nwe had left Lisbon, until we had found a refuge in Corunna did seem as\nthough the comings of eternity had been made final. For the turmoil\nof the winds and the waves was indeed excessive, and even those most\nskilled in the ways and the wonders of the deep asseverated that never\nhad been known weather so unpropitious to the going forth of ships.\nTruly this time, though less than three weeks in all, did seem of a\ndurance inconceivable to one on land.\n\nWhilst we lay in the harbour of Corunna, which was for more than four\nweary weeks, we effected some necessary repairs. The _San Cristobal_ had\nbeen taking water at the prow, and we should find the cause and remedy\nit. Possibly it was that the bow was left unfinished at San Lucar for\nthe better fixing of the figurehead, and that some small flaw thus begun\nmet enlargement from the straining of the timbers in the prolonged\nstorm. To the end of this repairing the work was given to some of the\nship-men on board, Swedes and other Northerns, the same being expert\ncalkers on account of their much experience of their repair of ships\ninjured in their troublous seas. Among them was one whom I mistrusted\nmuch, as did all on board, so that he should not have been retained save\nonly that he was a nimble and fearless mariner who be the seas never so\ngreat would take his place in the furlment of sails or in other perilous\nlabour of the sea. He was a Russian Finn and like all these heathen\npeople had strange powers of evill, or was by all accredited with the\nsame. For be it known that these Finns can, by some subtile and diabolic\nmeans, suck or otherwise derive the strength from timbers; so that many\na tall ship has through this agency gone down to the deep unknown. This\nFinn, Olgaref by name, was a notable calker and with some others was\nslung over the bow to calk the gaping seams. I made it to myself a\nnecessity to be present, for I regarded ever the cupidity of man\ntogether with the inestimable value of the Pope's gift. Right sure was\nI that no Spaniard or no Christian would lay a sacrilegious hand on\nthe Sacred Figure of Our Lord or of the good Saint who bore Him; and\nhitherto the esteem of all had been so great that none would dare so\nmuch. But with a pagan such considerations avail not, and I feared\nlest even his suspicions might be aroused. Well indeed were my fears\njustified. For as I leaned over the prow, I saw him touch the metal of\nthe Christ and of the Saint as though some of the same diabolic instinct\nwhich had taught him to deal infamously with the timbers of ships had\nguided him to the discernment of the metals also. Then as I looked, he,\nall unknowing of my observation, tapped softly with his calking-mallet\non both the metals which in turn gave out sounds which no one could\nmistake. He seemed satisfied with his quest, and resumed his work upon\nthe oakum with renewed zeal. Thenceforth during our stay in Corunna I so\narranged matters that ever both day and night there was a sentinel on\nthe prow of the _San Cristobal_. When the day came when, praise be to\nGod, 8,000 soldiers and sailors confessed to the friars of the fleet\non an island in the harbour in which the Archbishop of Santiago had\narranged altars--for we had no Bishop on the Armada--I feared lest\nOlgaref should make, through some inadvertence of those left behind,\nsome attempt upon the precious gift. He was too wary, however, and\nbehaved with such discretion that for the time my suspicion was\ndisarmed.\n\nOn the 22nd. July, after a Council of War in the Royal Galleon in which\nthe chief Admirals of the Fleet took part, our squadron, which had been\nwaiting outside the harbour of Corunna with the squadron of Andalusia,\nthe Guipuzcoan Squadron and the squadron of Ojeda, set sail on our great\nemprise.\n\nTruly it did seem as though the powers of the seas and the winds was\nleagued against us; for after but three days of fair weather we met with\ncalms and fogs and a very hurricane which was as none other of the same\never known in the month of Leo. The waves mounted to the very heavens,\nand some of them broke over the ships of the fleet doing thereby a vast\nof damage which could not be repaired whilst at sea. In this storm the\nwhole of the stern gallery of our galleon was carried away, and it was\nonly by the protection of the Most High that the breach so made was not\nthe means of ultimately whelming us in the sea. With the coming of the\nday we found that forty of the ships of the Armada were missing. On this\nday it was that that great and bold mariner the Admiral Don Pedro de\nValdes by his great daring and the hazard of his life saved my own life,\nwhen I had been swept overboard by a mighty sea. In gratitude for which\nI sent him that which I held most dear of my possessions, the jewell of\nthe San Cristobal given me by the Pope.\n\nThenceforth for a whole week were we hourly harassed by the enemy,\nwho, keeping aloof from us, yet managed by their superior artillery to\ninflict upon us incalculable damage; so that our carpenters and divers\nhad to work endlessly to stop the shot holes above water and below it\nwith tow and leaden plates.\n\nOn the last day of July two disasters befell, in both of which our\ngalleon afterwards had a part. The first, was to the ship _San Salvador_\nof Admiral Miguel de Aquendo's squadron, through the diabolic device of\na German gunmaster, who in revenge for punishment inflicted on him by\nCaptain Preig, threw, after firing his gun, his lighted linstock into a\nbarrel of powder, to the effect of blowing up the two afterdecks and the\npoop castle, and killing over two hundred men. As on this ship was Juan\nde Huerta the Paymaster General with a great part of the treasure of the\nKing, it was necessary that she should if possible be saved from the\nenemy who were rushing in upon her. The Duke, therefore firing a signal\ngun to the fleet to follow, stood by her to the dismay of the English,\nthus baulked of so rich a prey. In the strategy of getting the wounded\nship back to her place in the formation came the second disaster; for\nthe foremast of the flagship of Don Pedro de Valdes _Nuestra Senora del\nRosario_ gave way at the hatches, falling on the mainsail boom. The\nrising sea forbade the giving her a hawser; the Duke ordered Captain\nOjeda to stand by her with our pataches together with Don Pedro's own\nvice flagship the _San Francisco_ and our own _San Cristobal_. A galleon\nalso was to try to fix a hawser for towing; but the night shut down on\nus, and the wiser counsel of the Admiral-in-Chief advised by Diego\nFlores forbade so many ships to remain absent from the going on of the\nArmada lest they too should be cut off. So we said farewell to that\ngallant mariner Don Pedro de Valdes.\n\nThat same evening the wind began to blow and the sea to rise so that the\ninjured ship of Admiral Oquendo was in danger of sinking; wherefore the\nHigh Admiral, on such word being brought to him, gave orders that we\nshould keep close to her and take in our care the mariners and soldiers\non board her and also the King's treasure chest; for it was said that\nHis Catholic Majesty had on the Armada half a million crowns in bullion\nand coined money. It was dark as pitch when we saw the signal made when\nthe flagship shortened sail--two lanterns at the poop and one halfway\nup the rigging, put out for the guidance of the fleet. Fearsome their\nlights looked shining over the dark heaving waters which now and again\nso broke with the oncoming waves that the tracks of light seemed in\nplaces to rise and fall about as though they could never be reunited.\nBut our Mariners answered to the call, and the boats soon rocked by our\nsides and with a flash of our blades in the lamplight--for the battle\nlanterns were lit to aid them--one by one they were swept into the dark.\nIt was long before they came back, for the wild sea made their venture\nimpossible. But before noon of the next day they again made essay; and\nin several voyages brought back many men and great store of heavy boxes,\nwhich latter were forthwith lodged in the powder room which was guarded\nby night and day. This made greater anxiety for Senor de las Alas, in\nthat his seamen and mariners, and worse still the foreigners, knew that\nthere was such a store of wealth aboard.\n\nThenceforth we bore our part in the running fight which ensued between\nour Armada and the Squadrons of Drake and the Lord Admiral Howard; and\nalso that of John Hawkins which assailed us with such insistence that we\nfain thought the Devil himself must have some hand in his work. At last\ncame a time when by God's grace the flagship of the enemy was almost\nwithin our grasp, for she lay amongst us disabled. But many oar-boats of\nher consorts flocked to her, and towed her to safety in the calm which\nforbade us to follow. In this action a dire disaster had almost befallen\nus, and Christendom too, for a shot struck us athwart the bow and so\nloosened the girding of our precious figurehead that almost it had\nfallen into the sea. San Cristobal watched over his own, however; and\npresently we had with ropes haled it aboard and held it firmly with\ncables so that it was immediately safe. It was covered up with tow and\nsacking and so hidden under pretence of safety that none might discover\nthe secret of its intrinsic preciosity. Ere this was completed we were\nagain called to action, as for our fleetness we were required to chase\nwith the _San Juan_ of Portugal, the flagship of the enemy which was\nflying from our attack. For the English ships, though not so large, were\nswift as our own and more easy of handling; and by their prerogative of\nnimble steerage could so thwart our purposes that ere we could recover\non following their tacking, they were well away with full-bellied sail.\nBy this, however, we were saved much pain of concern, for when off\nCalais roads the Armada lay at anchor we, coming amongst the latermost,\nwere placed on the skirts of the fleet. Thus when the English on the\nnight of Sunday August 7th. sent their fire ships floating with wind and\ntide down on the Armada, so that in panic most of the great vessels had\nto slip their anchors or even to cut their cables, we could weigh with\ndue deliberance and set sail northerly according to our orders from the\nDuke.\n\nWhen by Newcastle we saw the English ships drop off in their pursuit we\nknew thereby that their finding was at an end and their magazines empty.\nWhereupon, setting our course ever northwards, so that rounding Scotland\nand Ireland we might seek Spain once more, we began our task of counting\nour scars, and thence to the work of the leech. Truly we were in\npitiable plight, for the long continued storm and strain had opened our\nseams and we took water abominably. In that we were of the most swift\nof the vessels of the fleet, our galleon and the _Trinidad_ of our own\nsquadron outsailed the rest, and bearing away to the eastward, though\nnot too much so, and thence north, found ourselves on the 11th day of\nAugust, off the coast of Aberdeyne. The sea had now fallen so far that\nthough the waves were more than we had reckoned upon at the first yet\nthey were but mild in comparison with what had been. Here in a sandy\nbay close under Buquhan Ness we cast anchor and began to overhaul.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBoth our ships had been very seriously damaged, and repairs were indeed\nnecessary which required careening, had such been possible. But it could\nnot be in a latitude where, even in the summer, the seas rose so fast\nand broke so wildly. Our consort the _Trinidad_, though in sad plight,\nwas not so bad as we were; and it was greatly to be feared that if\noccasion was not to be had for making good the ravages of the storm and\nthe enemy she might meet with disaster. But such amending might not be\nat this time. The weather was threatening; and moreover the enemy would\nsoon be following hard behind us. From one of our foreign seamen, a\nScotchman who in secret visited Aberdeyne, we learned that Queen\nElizabeth was sending out a swift patache to scour the whole northern\ncoast for any traces of the Armada. Though we were two galleons, we yet\nfeared such a meeting; for our stores were exhausted and our powder had\nrun low. Of ball we had none, for such fighting as these dogged\nEnglishmen are prone to. Moreover it is the way of these islanders to so\nhold together that when one is touched all others run to aid; whereby\nwere but one gun of ours fired, even off that desolate coast, in but a\nlittle while would be an army on the shore and a squadron of ships upon\nthe sea. It began therefore sorely to exercise my conscience as to how I\nshould best protect the treasure entrusted to me. Were it to fall into\nthe hands of our enemies it were the worst that could happen; and\nmatters had already so disastrously arranged themselves that it was to\nbe feared we should not hold ourselves in safety. Therefore, taking\nmuch counsel with Heaven, whose treasure indeed it was that I was\nguarding, I began to look about for some secret place of storage, to\nthe which I might resort in case danger should threaten before we could\nget safely away from the shore. The Artificers said that two days, or\nperhaps three, would be required to complete our restorations; and on\nthe first of these I took a small boat, and with two trusty mariners of\nmy own surroundings I set out to explore the land close to us, which\nwas of a veritable desolation. The shallow bay, in whose mouth we were\nanchored in a sufficiency of water at all tides, was lined with great\nsandhills from end to end save at the extremities, where rocks of\nexceeding durability manifested themselves even at high tide, but which\nshewed with ferocity at low water. We essayed at first the northern\nside, but presently abandoned the quest, for though there were many deep\nindentures, wherein the sea ran at times with exceeding violence, the\nsimple contours of the rocks and of the land above gave little promise\nof a secret place of storage.\n\nBut the south side was different. There had been in times long past much\nupheaval of various kinds, and now were many little bays, all iron-bound\nand full of danger, lying between outflanking rocks of a steepness\nunsurpassable. Seaweed was on many great rocks rising from the sea\nwhereon multitudinous wild fowl sat screaming; between them rose\nnumberless points often invisible, save when the surges fell from\nthem in their course, and amongst which the tide set with a wonderful\ncurrent, most perilous. Here, after we had many times escaped\noverturning, being borne by the side of sunken rocks, I at last made\ndiscovery of such a place as we required. Elsewhere I have recorded for\nyour guidance its bearings and all such details as may be needful for\nthe fullfillment of your duty. The cave was a great one on the south\nside of the bay, with many windings and blind offsets; and as best met\nmy wishes in accordance with my task, the entrance was not easy to be\ndiscovered, being small and of a rare quality for concealment. Here I\nmade preparation for the landing of the treasure, in so far as that I\ntook note of all things and made perfect my designs. I had left the\nmariners in the boat, enjoining them to remain in her in case of need,\nso that none of them, much though I trusted them, knew of the discovered\ncave. When we had returned to the galleon night had fallen.\n\nForthwith, after secret consultation with our admiral, I visited the\ncaptain of the _Trinidad_ and obtained his permission to use on that\nsame night one of his boats with a crew for some special private\nservice. For I had thought that it were better that none of our own\ncrew, who might have had suspicion of what wealth we carried, should\nhave a part in our undertaking. This my own kinsman Admiral de las Alas\nhad advised. When night came, he had so disposed matters on the _San\nCristobal_ that whilst our debarkation was being made, not even the\nsentries on deck or in the passage ways could see aught--they being sent\nbelow. The Captain himself onely remained on deck.\n\nWe made several voyages between the ship and the shore, piling after\neach our weighty packets on the pebble beach. None were left to guard\nthem, there being no one to molest. Last of all we took the great\nfigurehead of silver and gold, which Benvenuto had wrought and which the\nPope had blessed, and placed it on the shore beside the rest. Then the\nboat went back to the _Trinidad_. Climbing on the rock overhead, I saw a\nlantern flashed on her deck, as signal to assure me that the boat had\nreturned.\n\nPresently a boat of our own vessel drew near, as had been arranged,\nmanned by three trusty men of my own; and in silence we brought the\ntreasure into the cave. In the doing so we were mightily alarmed by a\nshot from a harquebuss from one of the ships in the bay. Eagerly we\nclimbed the rocks and looked around as well as we could in the darkness.\nBut all was still; what so had been, was completed. In the darkness, and\nwhilst the tide was low, we placed the treasure in a far branch of the\ncave, placing most of it in the shallow water. The sides of the rock\nwere sheer in this far chamber, save onely at the end where was a\ngreat shelf of rock. On this we placed the image of San Cristobal, not\nthinking it well that the Sacred Figure should lie prone. In this far\ncave the waters rose still and silent, for the force of the waves was\nbroken by the rocks without. It was risen so high in places as to cause\nus disquietude as we made our way out. My chosen mariners made, before\nwe left the shore, solemn oath on the Holy Relic of San Cristobal which\nthe Pope had given to me that they would never reveal aught of the\ndoings of the night.\n\nBefore dawn, which cometh early in these latitudes, we were back on\nboard ship; and sought our various quarters silently that none who knew\nof our absence might guess whence we came.\n\nMorning brought only more trouble to me. I was told that in the night\nthe harquebussier on sentry had seen a man swim from the ship and had\nfired at him. He could not tell in the darkness if his aim had been\ntrue. I said nothing of my suspicion; but later on discovered that the\nRussian Finn, Olgaref, had disappeared. I knew then that this man,\nhaving suspicions, had watched us; and that if he was still alive he\nperhaps knew of the entrance of the cave.\n\nAll day I took much counsel with myself as to how I should act; and at\nthe last my mind was made up. I had a sacred duty in protecting the\ntreasure. I should seek Olgaref if he had reached the shore and should\nif need be kill him; and by this and other means, secure the secret of\nthe entrance of the cave. Thus, you will see, oh! my children, the heavy\nnature of the Pope's Trust, and what stern duty it may entail on all of\nus who guard it.\n\nSecretly during the day I made preparation for my enterprise. I placed\non board the small boat which we had used, some barrels of gunpowder,\nwherein I had very much difficulty for our store of armament had run low\nindeed and only the Admiral's knowledge of the greatness of my Trust and\nthe measure of my need inclined him to part with even so much. I rowed\nmyself ashore in the afternoon, and harquebuss in hand made search of\nall the many promontories and their secret recesses for the Finn. For\nsome hours I searched, examining every cranny in the rock; but no sign\ncould I find of Olgaref. At last I gave up my search and came to the\ncave to complete the work which I had determined upon. Lighting my\nlantern I waded into the shallow water which lay in the entrance and\nstretched inland under the great overhanging rock flanked by two great\nmasses of stone that towered up on either hand. Patiently I waded on,\nfor the tide was low, through the curvings of the cave; the black stone\non one hand and the red on the other giving back the flare of the\nlantern. Turning to the right I waded on, knowing that I would see\nbefore me the golden figure of San Cristobal. But suddenly I came to an\nend and for a moment stood appalled. The Figure no longer stood erect\nas placed on the wide shelf of rock, but lay prone resting on something\nwhich raised one end of it. Lifting high the lantern, I saw that this\nmass was none other than the dead body of Olgaref.\n\nThe wretched man had after all escaped from the galleon and in secret\nfollowed us to the cave. He had climbed upon the shelf and in an\nendeavour to steal the precious figure had pulled it over on himself;\nand the weight of the gold which formed the Christ had in falling killed\nhim. He had evidently not known of the other treasure, and had followed\nonly this of which he had knowledge. As I was about to shut the entrance\nto the cave until such time as I could come with safety to open it, I\ndid not disturb the body, but left it underneath the Holy Image which he\nhad dared to touch with sacrilegious hand.\n\nAt the Judgment Day, should the treasure not be recovered, he will find\nit hard to rise from that encumbrance that his evil deed had brought\nupon him.\n\nWith sad heart I came away; and then, for that I had to guard the Pope's\ntreasure, I fixed the barrels of gunpowder in place to best wreak the\neffect I wished. After piling them with rocks as mighty as I could lift,\nI laid a slow match which I lighted; then I stood afar off to wait and\nwatch.\n\nPresently the end came. With a sound as of many cannon, though muffled\nin its coming, the charge was fired, and with a great puff of white\nsmoke which rose high in air together with stones and earth and the\nupheaval of a great mass of rock which seemed to shake the far off place\non which I rested, the whole front of the cave blew up. Then the white\ncloud sank lower and floated away over the grass; and for a few minutes\nonly a dark thin vapour hung over the spot. When this had gone too I\ncame close and saw that the great stone pinnacles had been overthrown,\nand that so many great rocks had fallen around that the entrance to the\ncave was no more, there being no sign of it. Even the channel of water\nwhich led up to it was so overwhelmed with great stones that no trace of\nit remained.\n\nThen I breathed more freely, for the Pope's treasure was for the\npresent safe, and enclosed in the great cave in the bowels of the earth,\nwhere I or mine though with much labour could find it again, in good\nseason.\n\nIn the dark I came back to the _San Cristobal_ where my kinsman the\nadmiral told me that already rumours were afloat that I had gone to hide\nsome treasure. Whereupon we conferred together, and late that night, but\nmaking such noise that many of the soldiers and mariners could hear what\nwas being done and give news in secret of our movements, we made\npretense of making a great shipment into the _Trinidad_ so that the\nsuspicions of all were thereupon allayed.\n\nIn the morning the Armada--all that was left of it--hove in sight; and\njoining it we began a dreary voyage, amid storms and tempests and trials\nand the loss of many of our great ships on the inhospitable coast of\nIreland, which lasted many days till we found ourselves back again in\nSpain.\n\nThence, in due season, anxious to see that the Pope's treasure had not\nbeen discovered, I made my way in secret again to Aberdeyne where there\novertook me, from the rigours of this northern climate and from many\nhardships undergone, the sickness whereof I am weary.\n\nWhere and how the place of hiding will be found I have told in the\nsecret writing deposited in the place prepared for it, the chart being\nexact. I have written all these matters, because it is well that you my\nsonne, and ye all my children who may have to look forward so much and\nso long to the fullfillment of the Trust, may know how to look back as\nwell.\n\nThese letters and papers, should I fail to return from that wild\nheadland, shall be placed in your hands by one whose kindness I have\nreason to trust, and who has sworn to deliver them safely on your\napplication.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit www.gutenberg.org\/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n\n","id":803,"split":"train"}
