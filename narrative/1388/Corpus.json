Many of the men die slow, painful deaths, and they all would have had a boat not stumbled across them. However, when they arrive back home, Bennett and his surviving men are greeted with a heroes welcome.\nAt this point the attention of the novel shifts to Lloyd Searight, a young, attractive girl, who works as a nurse, despite being independently wealthy. The reader discovers that Lloyd and Bennett have mutual feelings for each other, although neither one has ever expressed these feelings.\nFerriss, Bennett's closest friend. contracts typhoid fever, and Lloyd is in charge of nursing him. Fearing that she will contract the disease, Bennett refuses to let Lloyd come near Ferriss, and as a result, Ferriss dies. Lloyd refuses to speak to Bennett, and they both enter into a time of deep despair. However, when Bennett comes down with the same disease, Lloyd is forced to nurse him, and they eventually reconcile, and marry. At this point, Lloyd gives up nursing, Bennett gives up exploring, and they go live in the country together while Bennett works on a book, both for a while very happy with their situation. However, after talking with Bennet's man Alder, who does work around the house, Lloyd realizes that it is Bennett's calling, his duty to America, to lead the first expedition to the north pole. The book ends with him setting off, while Lloyd rather proudly watches him go.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg eBook, A Man's Woman, by Frank Norris\n\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

After the plates had been made\nnotice was received that a play called \"A Man's Woman\" had been written\nby Anne Crawford Flexner, and that this title had been copyrighted.\n\nAs it was impossible to change the name of the novel at the time this\nnotice was received, it has been published under its original title.\n\nF.N.\n\nNew York.\n\n\n\n\nA MAN'S WOMAN\n\n\n\n\nI.\n\n\nAt four o'clock in the morning everybody in the tent was still asleep,\nexhausted by the terrible march of the previous day. The hummocky ice\nand pressure-ridges that Bennett had foreseen had at last been met with,\nand, though camp had been broken at six o'clock and though men and dogs\nhad hauled and tugged and wrestled with the heavy sledges until five\no'clock in the afternoon, only a mile and a half had been covered. But\nthough the progress was slow, it was yet progress. It was not the\nharrowing, heart-breaking immobility of those long months aboard the\nFreja. Every yard to the southward, though won at the expense of a\nbattle with the ice, brought them nearer to Wrangel Island and ultimate\nsafety.\n\nThen, too, at supper-time the unexpected had happened. Bennett, moved no\ndoubt by their weakened condition, had dealt out extra rations to each\nman: one and two-thirds ounces of butter and six and two-thirds ounces\nof aleuronate bread--a veritable luxury after the unvarying diet of\npemmican, lime juice, and dried potatoes of the past fortnight. The men\nhad got into their sleeping-bags early, and until four o'clock in the\nmorning had slept profoundly, inert, stupefied, almost without movement.\nBut a few minutes after four o'clock Bennett awoke. He was usually up\nabout half an hour before the others. On the day before he had been able\nto get a meridian altitude of the sun, and was anxious to complete his\ncalculations as to the expedition's position on the chart that he had\nbegun in the evening.\n\nHe pushed back the flap of the sleeping-bag and rose to his full height,\npassing his hands over his face, rubbing the sleep from his eyes. He was\nan enormous man, standing six feet two inches in his reindeer footnips\nand having the look more of a prize-fighter than of a scientist. Even\nmaking allowances for its coating of dirt and its harsh, black stubble\nof half a week's growth, the face was not pleasant. Bennett was an ugly\nman. His lower jaw was huge almost to deformity, like that of the\nbulldog, the chin salient, the mouth close-gripped, with great lips,\nindomitable, brutal. The forehead was contracted and small, the forehead\nof men of single ideas, and the eyes, too, were small and twinkling, one\nof them marred by a sharply defined cast.\n\nBut as Bennett was fumbling in the tin box that was lashed upon the\nnumber four sledge, looking for his notebook wherein he had begun his\ncalculations for latitude, he was surprised to find a copy of the record\nhe had left in the instrument box under the cairn at Cape Kammeni at the\nbeginning of this southerly march. He had supposed that this copy had\nbeen mislaid, and was not a little relieved to come across it now. He\nread it through hastily, his mind reviewing again the incidents of the\nlast few months. Certain extracts of this record ran as follows:\n\n\"Arctic steamer Freja, on ice off Cape Kammeni, New Siberian\nIslands, 76 deg. 10 min. north latitude, 150 deg. 40 min. east\nlongitude, July 12, 1891.... We accordingly froze the ship in on\nthe last day of September, 1890, and during the following winter\ndrifted with the pack in a northwesterly direction.... On Friday,\nJuly 10, 1891, being in latitude 76 deg. 10 min. north; longitude\n150 deg. 10 min. east, the Freja was caught in a severe nip between\ntwo floes and was crushed, sinking in about two hours. We abandoned\nher, saving 200 days' provisions and all necessary clothing,\ninstruments, etc....\n\n\"I shall now attempt a southerly march over the ice to Kolyuchin Bay\nby way of Wrangel Island, where provisions have been cached, hoping\nto fall in with the relief ships or steam whalers on the way. Our\nparty consists of the following twelve persons: ... All well with\nthe exception of Mr. Ferriss, the chief engineer, whose left hand\nhas been badly frostbitten. No scurvy in the party as yet. We have\neighteen Ostiak dogs with us in prime condition, and expect to drag\nour ship's boat upon sledges.\n\n\"WARD BENNETT, Commanding Freja Arctic Exploring Expedition.\"\n\nBennett returned this copy of the record to its place in the box, and\nstood for a moment in the centre of the tent, his head bent to avoid the\nridge-pole, looking thoughtfully upon the ground.\n\nWell, so far all had gone right--no scurvy, provisions in plenty. The\ndogs were in good condition, his men cheerful, trusting in him as in a\ngod, and surely no leader could wish for a better lieutenant and comrade\nthan Richard Ferriss--but this hummocky ice--these pressure-ridges which\nthe expedition had met the day before. Instead of turning at once to his\nciphering Bennett drew the hood of the wolfskin coat over his head,\nbuttoned a red flannel mask across his face, and, raising the flap of\nthe tent, stepped outside.\n\nUnder the lee of the tent the dogs were sleeping, moveless bundles of\nfur, black and white, perceptibly steaming. The three great McClintock\nsledges, weighted down with the Freja's boats and with the expedition's\nimpedimenta, lay where they had been halted the evening before.\n\nIn the sky directly in front of Bennett as he issued from the tent three\nmoons, hooped in a vast circle of nebulous light, shone roseate through\na fine mist, while in the western heavens streamers of green, orange,\nand vermilion light, immeasurably vast, were shooting noiselessly from\nhorizon to zenith.\n\nBut Bennett had more on his mind that morning than mock-moons and\nauroras. To the south and east, about a quarter of a mile from the tent,\nthe pressure of the floes had thrown up an enormous ridge of shattered\nice-cakes, a mound, a long hill of blue-green slabs and blocks huddling\ntogether at every conceivable angle. It was nearly twenty feet in\nheight, quite the highest point that Bennett could discover. Scrambling\nand climbing over countless other ridges that intervened, he made his\nway to it, ascended it almost on hands and knees, and, standing upon its\nhighest point, looked long and carefully to the southward.\n\nA wilderness beyond all thought, words, or imagination desolate\nstretched out before him there forever and forever--ice, ice, ice,\nfields and floes of ice, laying themselves out under that gloomy sky,\nleague after league, endless, sombre, infinitely vast, infinitely\nformidable. But now it was no longer the smooth ice over which the\nexpedition had for so long been travelling. In every direction,\nintersecting one another at ten thousand points, crossing and\nrecrossing, weaving a gigantic, bewildering network of gashed, jagged,\nsplintered ice-blocks, ran the pressure-ridges and hummocks. In places a\nscore or more of these ridges had been wedged together to form one huge\nfield of broken slabs of ice miles in width, miles in length. From\nhorizon to horizon there was no level place, no open water, no pathway.\nThe view to the southward resembled a tempest-tossed ocean suddenly\nfrozen.\n\nOne of these ridges Bennett had just climbed, and upon it he now stood.\nEven for him, unencumbered, carrying no weight, the climb had been\ndifficult; more than once he had slipped and fallen. At times he had\nbeen obliged to go forward almost on his hands and knees. And yet it was\nacross that jungle of ice, that unspeakable tangle of blue-green slabs\nand cakes and blocks, that the expedition must now advance, dragging its\nboats, its sledges, its provisions, instruments, and baggage.\n\nBennett stood looking. Before him lay his task. There under his eyes was\nthe Enemy. Face to face with him was the titanic primal strength of a\nchaotic world, the stupendous still force of a merciless nature, waiting\ncalmly, waiting silently to close upon and crush him. For a long time he\nstood watching. Then the great brutal jaw grew more salient than ever,\nthe teeth set and clenched behind the close-gripped lips, the cast in\nthe small twinkling eyes grew suddenly more pronounced. One huge fist\nraised, and the arm slowly extended forward like the resistless moving\nof a piston. Then when his arm was at its full reach Bennett spoke as\nthough in answer to the voiceless, terrible challenge of the Ice.\nThrough his clenched teeth his words came slow and measured.\n\n\"But I'll break you, by God! believe me, I will.\"\n\nAfter a while he returned to the tent, awoke the cook, and while\nbreakfast was being prepared completed his calculations for latitude,\nwrote up his ice-journal, and noted down the temperature and the\ndirection and velocity of the wind. As he was finishing, Richard\nFerriss, who was the chief engineer and second in command, awoke and\nimmediately asked the latitude.\n\n\"Seventy-four-fifteen,\" answered Bennett without looking up.\n\n\"Seventy-four-fifteen,\" repeated Ferriss, nodding his head; \"we didn't\nmake much distance yesterday.\"\n\n\"I hope we can make as much to-day,\" returned Bennett grimly as he put\naway his observation-journal and note-books.\n\n\"How's the ice to the south'ard?\"\n\n\"Bad; wake the men.\"\n\nAfter breakfast and while the McClintocks were being loaded Bennett sent\nFerriss on ahead to choose a road through and over the ridges. It was\ndreadful work. For two hours Ferriss wandered about amid the broken ice\nall but hopelessly bewildered. But at length, to his great satisfaction,\nhe beheld a fairly open stretch about a quarter of a mile in length\nlying out to the southwest and not too far out of the expedition's line\nof march. Some dozen ridges would have to be crossed before this level\nwas reached; but there was no help for it, so Ferriss planted his flags\nwhere the heaps of ice-blocks seemed least impracticable and returned\ntoward the camp. It had already been broken, and on his way he met the\nentire expedition involved in the intricacies of the first rough ice.\n\nAll of the eighteen dogs had been harnessed to the number two sledge,\nthat carried the whaleboat and the major part of the provisions, and\nevery man of the party, Bennett included, was straining at the\nhaul-ropes with the dogs. Foot by foot the sledge came over the ridge,\ngrinding and lurching among the ice-blocks; then, partly by guiding,\npartly by lifting, it was piloted down the slope, only in the end to\nescape from all control and come crashing downward among the dogs,\njolting one of the medicine chests from its lashings and butting its\nnose heavily against the foot of the next hummock immediately beyond.\nBut the men scrambled to their places again, the medicine chest was\nreplaced, and Muck Tu, the Esquimau dog-master, whipped forward his\ndogs. Ferriss, too, laid hold. The next hummock was surmounted, the dogs\npanting, and the men, even in that icy air, reeking with perspiration.\nThen suddenly and without the least warning Bennett and McPherson, who\nwere in the lead, broke through some young ice into water up to their\nbreasts, Muck Tu and one of the dogs breaking through immediately\nafterward. The men were pulled out, or, of their own efforts, climbed\nupon the ice again. But in an instant their clothes were frozen to\nrattling armor.\n\n\"Bear off to the east'ard, here!\" commanded Bennett, shaking the icy,\nstinging water from his sleeves. \"Everybody on the ropes now!\"\n\nAnother pressure-ridge was surmounted, then a third, and by an hour\nafter the start they had arrived at the first one of Ferriss's flags.\nHere the number two sledge was left, and the entire expedition, dogs and\nmen, returned to camp to bring up the number one McClintock loaded with\nthe Freja's cutter and with the sleeping-bags, instruments, and tent.\nThis sledge was successfully dragged over the first two hummocks, but as\nit was being hauled up the third its left-hand runner suddenly buckled\nand turned under it with a loud snap. There was nothing for it now but\nto remove the entire load and to set Hawes, the carpenter, to work upon\nits repair.\n\n\"Up your other sledge!\" ordered Bennett.\n\nOnce more the expedition returned to the morning's camping-place, and,\nharnessing itself to the third McClintock, struggled forward with it for\nan hour and a half until it was up with the first sledge and Ferriss's\nflag. Fortunately the two dog-sleds, four and five, were light, and\nBennett, dividing his forces, brought them up in a single haul. But\nHawes called out that the broken sledge was now repaired. The men turned\nto at once, reloaded it, and hauled it onward, so that by noon every\nsledge had been moved forward quite a quarter of a mile.\n\nBut now, for the moment, the men, after going over the same ground seven\ntimes, were used up, and Muck Tu could no longer whip the dogs to their\nwork. Bennett called a halt. Hot tea was made, and pemmican and hardtack\nserved out.\n\n\"We'll have easier hauling this afternoon, men,\" said Bennett; \"this\nnext ridge is the worst of the lot; beyond that Mr. Ferriss says we've\ngot nearly a quarter of a mile of level floes.\"\n\nOn again at one o'clock; but the hummock of which Bennett had spoken\nproved absolutely impassable for the loaded sledges. It was all one that\nthe men lay to the ropes like draught-horses, and that Muck Tu flogged\nthe dogs till the goad broke in his hands. The men lost their footing\nupon the slippery ice and fell to their knees; the dogs laid down in the\ntraces groaning and whining. The sledge would not move.\n\n\"Unload!\" commanded Bennett.\n\nThe lashings were taken off, and the loads, including the great,\ncumbersome whaleboat itself, carried over the hummock by hand. Then the\nsledge itself was hauled over and reloaded upon the other side. Thus the\nwhole five sledges.\n\nThe work was bitter hard; the knots of the lashings were frozen tight\nand coated with ice; the cases of provisions, the medicine chests, the\ncanvas bundle of sails, boat-covers, and tents unwieldy and of enormous\nweight; the footing on the slippery, uneven ice precarious, and more\nthan once a man, staggering under his load, broke through the crust into\nwater so cold that the sensation was like that of burning.\n\nBut at last everything was over, the sledges reloaded, and the forward\nmovement resumed. Only one low hummock now intervened between them and\nthe longed-for level floe.\n\nHowever, as they were about to start forward again a lamentable gigantic\nsound began vibrating in their ears, a rumbling, groaning note rising by\nquick degrees to a strident shriek. Other sounds, hollow and\nshrill--treble mingling with diapason--joined in the first. The noise\ncame from just beyond the pressure-mound at the foot of which the party\nhad halted.\n\n\"Forward!\" shouted Bennett; \"hurry there, men!\"\n\nDesperately eager, the men bent panting to their work. The sledge\nbearing the whaleboat topped the hummock.\n\n\"Now, then, over with her!\" cried Ferriss.\n\nBut it was too late. As they stood looking down upon it for an instant,\nthe level floe, their one sustaining hope during all the day, suddenly\ncracked from side to side with the noise of ordnance. Then the groaning\nand shrieking recommenced. The crack immediately closed up, the pressure\non the sides of the floe began again, and on the smooth surface of the\nice, domes and mounds abruptly reared themselves. As the pressure\nincreased these domes and mounds cracked and burst into countless blocks\nand slabs. Ridge after ridge was formed in the twinkling of an eye.\nThundering like a cannonade of siege guns, the whole floe burst up,\njagged, splintered, hummocky. In less than three minutes, and while the\nFreja's men stood watching, the level stretch toward which since morning\nthey had struggled with incalculable toil was ground up into a vast mass\nof confused and pathless rubble.\n\n\"Oh, this will never do,\" muttered Ferriss, disheartened.\n\n\"Come on, men!\" exclaimed Bennett. \"Mr. Ferriss, go forward, and choose\na road for us.\"\n\nThe labour of the morning was recommenced. With infinite patience,\ninfinite hardship, the sledges one by one were advanced. So heavy were\nthe three larger McClintocks that only one could be handled at a time,\nand that one taxed the combined efforts of men and dogs to the\nuttermost. The same ground had to be covered seven times. For every yard\ngained seven had to be travelled. It was not a march, it was a battle; a\nbattle without rest and without end and without mercy; a battle with an\nEnemy whose power was beyond all estimate and whose movements were not\nreducible to any known law. A certain course would be mapped, certain\nplans formed, a certain objective determined, and before the course\ncould be finished, the plans executed, or the objective point attained\nthe perverse, inexplicable movement of the ice baffled their\ndetermination and set at naught their best ingenuity.\n\nAt four o'clock it began to snow. Since the middle of the forenoon the\nhorizon had been obscured by clouds and mist so that no observation for\nposition could be taken. Steadily the clouds had advanced, and by four\no'clock the expedition found itself enveloped by wind and driving snow.\nThe flags could no longer be distinguished; thin and treacherous ice was\nconcealed under drifts; the dogs floundered helplessly; the men could\nscarcely open their eyes against the wind and fine, powder-like snow,\nand at times when they came to drag forward the last sledge they found\nit so nearly buried in the snow that it must be dug out before it could\nbe moved.\n\nToward half past five the odometer on one of the dog-sleds registered a\ndistance of three-quarters of a mile made since morning. Bennett called\na halt, and camp was pitched in the lee of one of the larger hummocks.\nThe alcohol cooker was set going, and supper was had under the tent, the\nmen eating as they lay in their sleeping-bags. But even while eating\nthey fell asleep, drooping lower and lower, finally collapsing upon the\ncanvas floor of the tent, the food still in their mouths.\n\nYet, for all that, the night was miserable. Even after that day of\nsuperhuman struggle they were not to be allowed a few hours of unbroken\nrest. By midnight the wind had veered to the east and was blowing a\ngale. An hour later the tent came down. Exhausted as they were, they\nmust turn out and wrestle with that slatting, ice-sheathed canvas, and\nit was not until half an hour later that everything was fast again.\n\nOnce more they crawled into the sleeping-bags, but soon the heat from\ntheir bodies melted the ice upon their clothes, and pools of water\nformed under each man, wetting him to the skin. Sleep was impossible. It\ngrew colder and colder as the night advanced, and the gale increased. At\nthree o'clock in the morning the centigrade thermometer was at eighteen\ndegrees below. The cooker was lighted again, and until six o'clock the\nparty huddled wretchedly about it, dozing and waking, shivering\ncontinually.\n\nBreakfast at half past six o'clock; under way again an hour later. There\nwas no change in the nature of the ice. Ridge succeeded ridge, hummock\nfollowed upon hummock. The wind was going down, but the snow still fell\nas fine and bewildering as ever. The cold was intense. Dennison, the\ndoctor and naturalist of the expedition, having slipped his mitten, had\nhis hand frostbitten before he could recover it. Two of the dogs, Big\nJoe and Stryelka, were noticeably giving out.\n\nBut Bennett, his huge jaws clenched, his small, distorted eyes twinkling\nviciously through the apertures of the wind-mask, his harsh, black\neyebrows lowering under the narrow, contracted forehead, drove the\nexpedition to its work relentlessly. Not Muck Tu, the dog-master, had\nhis Ostiaks more completely under his control than he his men. He\nhimself did the work of three. On that vast frame of bone and muscle,\nfatigue seemed to leave no trace. Upon that inexorable bestial\ndetermination difficulties beyond belief left no mark. Not one of the\ntwelve men under his command fighting the stubborn ice with tooth and\nnail who was not galvanised with his tremendous energy. It was as though\na spur was in their flanks, a lash upon their backs. Their minds, their\nwills, their efforts, their physical strength to the last ounce and\npennyweight belonged indissolubly to him. For the time being they were\nhis slaves, his serfs, his beasts of burden, his draught animals, no\nbetter than the dogs straining in the traces beside them. Forward they\nmust and would go until they dropped in the harness or he gave the word\nto pause.\n\nAt four o'clock in the afternoon Bennett halted. Two miles had been made\nsince the last camp, and now human endurance could go no farther.\nSometimes when the men fell they were unable to get up. It was evident\nthere was no more in them that day.\n\nIn his ice-journal for that date Bennett wrote:\n\n\"... Two miles covered by 4 p.m. Our course continues to be south,\n20 degrees west (magnetic). The ice still hummocky. At this rate we\nshall be on half rations long before we reach Wrangel Island. No\nobservation possible since day before yesterday on account of snow\nand clouds. Stryelka, one of our best dogs, gave out to-day. Shot\nhim and fed him to the others. Our advance to the southwest is slow\nbut sure, and every day brings nearer our objective. Temperature at\n6 p.m., 6.8 degrees Fahr. (minus 14 degrees C). Wind, east; force, 2.\"\n\nThe next morning was clear for two hours after breakfast, and when\nFerriss returned from his task of path-finding he reported to Bennett\nthat he had seen a great many water-blinks off to the southwest.\n\n\"The wind of yesterday has broken the ice up,\" observed Bennett; \"we\nshall have hard work to-day.\"\n\nA little after midday, at a time when they had wrested some thousand\nyards to the southward from the grip of the ice, the expedition came to\nthe first lane of open water, about three hundred feet in width. Bennett\nhalted the sledges and at once set about constructing a bridge of\nfloating cakes of ice. But the work of keeping these ice-blocks in place\nlong enough for the transfer of even a single sledge seemed at times to\nbe beyond their most strenuous endeavour. The first sledge with the\ncutter crossed in safety. Then came the turn of number two, loaded with\nthe provisions and whaleboat. It was two-thirds of the way across when\nthe opposite side of the floe abruptly shifted its position, and thirty\nfeet of open water suddenly widened out directly in front of the line of\nprogress.\n\n\"Cut loose!\" commanded Bennett upon the instant. The ice-block upon\nwhich they were gathered was set free in the current. The situation was\none of the greatest peril. The entire expedition, men and dogs together,\nwith their most important sledge, was adrift. But the oars and mast and\nthe pole of the tent were had from the whaleboat, and little by little\nthey ferried themselves across. The gap was bridged again and the\ndog-sleds transferred.\n\nBut now occurred the first real disaster since the destruction of the\nship. Half-way across the crazy pontoon bridge of ice, the dogs,\nharnessed to one of the small sleds, became suddenly terrified. Before\nany one could interfere they had bolted from Muck Tu's control in a wild\nbreak for the farther side of the ice. The sled was overturned;\npell-mell the dogs threw themselves into the water; the sled sank, the\nload-lashing parted, and two medicine chests, the bag of sewing\nmaterials--of priceless worth--a coil of wire ropes, and three hundred\nand fifty pounds of pemmican were lost in the twinkling of an eye.\n\nWithout comment Bennett at once addressed himself to making the best of\nthe business. The dogs were hauled upon the ice; the few loads that yet\nremained upon the sled were transferred to another; that sled was\nabandoned, and once more the expedition began its never-ending battle to\nthe southward.\n\nThe lanes of open water, as foreshadowed by the water-blinks that\nFerriss had noted in the morning, were frequent; alternating steadily\nwith hummocks and pressure-ridges. But the perversity of the ice was all\nbut heart-breaking. At every hour the lanes opened and closed. At one\ntime in the afternoon they had arrived upon the edge of a lane wide\nenough to justify them in taking to their boats. The sledges were\nunloaded, and stowed upon the boats themselves, and oars and sails made\nready. Then as Bennett was about to launch the lane suddenly closed up.\nWhat had been water became a level floe, and again the process of\nunloading and reloading had to be undertaken.\n\nThat evening Big Joe and two other dogs, Gavriga and Patsy, were shot\nbecause of their uselessness in the traces. Their bodies were cut up to\nfeed their mates.\n\n\"I can spare the dogs,\" wrote Bennett in his journal for that\nday--a Sunday--\"but McPherson, one of the best men of the command,\ngives me some uneasiness. His frozen footnips have chafed sores in\nhis ankle. One of these has ulcerated, and the doctor tells me is\nin a serious condition. His pain is so great that he can no longer\nhaul with the others. Shall relieve him from work during the\nmorrow's march. Less than a mile covered to-day. Meridian\nobservation for latitude impossible on account of fog. Divine\nservices at 5:30 p.m.\"\n\nA week passed, then another. There was no change, neither in the\ncharacter of the ice nor in the expedition's daily routine. Their toil\nwas incredible; at times an hour's unremitting struggle would gain but a\nfew yards. The dogs, instead of aiding them, were rapidly becoming mere\nencumbrances. Four more had been killed, a fifth had been drowned, and\ntwo, wandering from camp, had never returned. The second dog-sled had\nbeen abandoned. The condition of McPherson's foot was such that no work\ncould be demanded from him. Hawes, the carpenter, was down with fever\nand kept everybody awake all night by talking in his sleep. Worse than\nall, however, Ferriss's right hand was again frostbitten, and this time\nDennison, the doctor, was obliged to amputate it above the wrist.\n\n\"... But I am no whit disheartened,\" wrote Bennett. \"Succeed I must\nand shall.\"\n\nA few days after the operation on Ferriss's hand Bennett decided it\nwould be advisable to allow the party a full twenty-four hours' rest.\nThe march of the day before had been harder than any they had yet\nexperienced, and, in addition to McPherson and the carpenter, the doctor\nhimself was upon the sick list.\n\nIn the evening Bennett and Ferriss took a long walk or rather climb over\nthe ice to the southwest, picking out a course for the next day's march.\n\nA great friendship, not to say affection, had sprung up between these\ntwo men, a result of their long and close intimacy on board the Freja\nand of the hardships and perils they had shared during the past few\nweeks while leading the expedition in the retreat to the southward. When\nthey had decided upon the track of the morrow's advance they sat down\nfor a moment upon the crest of a hummock to breathe themselves, their\nelbows on their knees, looking off to the south over the desolation of\nbroken ice.\n\nWith his one good hand Ferriss drew a pipe and a handful of tea leaves\nwrapped in oiled paper from the breast of his deer-skin parkie.\n\n\"Do you mind filling this pipe for me, Ward?\" he asked of Bennett.\n\nBennett glanced at the tea leaves and handed them back to Ferriss, and\nin answer to his remonstrance produced a pouch of his own.\n\n\"Tobacco!\" cried Ferriss, astonished; \"why, I thought we smoked our last\naboard ship.\"\n\n\"No, I saved a little of mine.\"\n\n\"Oh, well,\" answered Ferriss, trying to interfere with Bennett, who was\nfilling his pipe, \"I don't want your tobacco; this tea does very well.\"\n\n\"I tell you I have eight-tenths of a kilo left,\" lied Bennett, lighting\nthe pipe and handing it back to him. \"Whenever you want a smoke you can\nset to me.\"\n\nBennett lit a pipe of his own, and the two began to smoke.\n\n\"'M, ah!\" murmured Ferriss, drawing upon the pipe ecstatically, \"I\nthought I never was going to taste good weed again till we should get\nhome.\"\n\nBennett said nothing. There was a long silence. Home! what did not that\nword mean for them? To leave all this hideous, grisly waste of ice\nbehind, to have done with fighting, to rest, to forget responsibility,\nto have no more anxiety, to be warm once more--warm and well fed and\ndry--to see a tree again, to rub elbows with one's fellows, to know the\nmeaning of warm handclasps and the faces of one's friends.\n\n\"Dick,\" began Bennett abruptly after a long while, \"if we get stuck here\nin this damned ice I'm going to send you and probably Metz on ahead for\nhelp. We'll make a two-man kyack for you to use when you reach the limit\nof the pack, but besides the kyack you'll carry nothing but your\nprovisions, sleeping-bags, and rifle, and travel as fast as you can.\"\nBennett paused for a moment, then in a different voice continued: \"I\nwrote a letter last night that I was going to give you in case I should\nhave to send you on such a journey, but I think I might as well give it\nto you now.\"\n\nHe drew from his pocket an envelope carefully wrapped in oilskin.\n\n\"If anything should happen to the expedition--to me--I want you to see\nthat this letter is delivered.\"\n\nHe paused again.\n\n\"You see, Dick, it's like this; there's a girl--\" his face flamed\nsuddenly, \"no--no, a woman, a grand, noble, man's woman, back in God's\ncountry who is a great deal to me--everything in fact. She don't know,\nhasn't a guess, that I care. I never spoke to her about it. But if\nanything should turn up I should want her to know how it had been\nwith me, how much she was to me. So I've written her. You'll see that\nshe gets it, will you?\"\n\nHe handed the little package to Ferriss, and continued indifferently,\nand resuming his accustomed manner:\n\n\"If we get as far as Wrangel Island you can give it back to me. We are\nbound to meet the relief ships or the steam whalers in that latitude.\nOh, you can look at the address,\" added Bennett as Ferriss, turning the\nenvelope bottom side up, was thrusting it into his breast pocket; \"you\nknow her even better than I do. It's Lloyd Searight.\"\n\nFerriss's teeth shut suddenly upon his pipestem.\n\nBennett rose. \"Tell Muck Tu,\" he said, \"in case I don't think of it\nagain, that the dogs must be fed from now on from those that die. I\nshall want the dog biscuit and dried fish for our own use.\"\n\n\"I suppose it will come to that,\" answered Ferriss.\n\n\"Come to that!\" returned Bennett grimly; \"I hope the dogs themselves\nwill live long enough for us to eat them. And don't misunderstand,\" he\nadded; \"I talk about our getting stuck in the ice, about my not pulling\nthrough; it's only because one must foresee everything, be prepared for\neverything. Remember--I--shall--pull--through.\"\n\nBut that night, long after the rest were sleeping, Ferriss, who had not\nclosed his eyes, bestirred himself, and, as quietly as possible, crawled\nfrom his sleeping-bag. He fancied there was some slight change in the\natmosphere, and wanted to read the barometer affixed to a stake just\noutside the tent. Yet when he had noted that it was, after all,\nstationary, he stood for a moment looking out across the ice with\nunseeing eyes. Then from a pocket in his furs he drew a little folder of\nmorocco. It was pitiably worn, stained with sea-water, patched and\nrepatched, its frayed edges sewed together again with ravellings of\ncloth and sea-grasses. Loosening with his teeth the thong of walrus-hide\nwith which it was tied, Ferriss opened it and held it to the faint light\nof an aurora just paling in the northern sky.\n\n\"So,\" he muttered after a while, \"so--Bennett, too--\"\n\nFor a long time Ferriss stood looking at Lloyd's picture till the purple\nstreamers in the north faded into the cold gray of the heavens. Then he\nshot a glance above him.\n\n\"God Almighty, bless her and keep her!\" he prayed.\n\nFar off, miles away, an ice-floe split with the prolonged reverberation\nof thunder. The aurora was gone. Ferriss returned to the tent.\n\nThe following week the expedition suffered miserably. Snowstorm followed\nsnowstorm, the temperature dropped to twenty-two degrees below the\nfreezing-point, and gales of wind from the east whipped and scourged the\nstruggling men incessantly with myriad steel-tipped lashes. At night the\nagony in their feet was all but unbearable. It was impossible to be\nwarm, impossible to be dry. Dennison, in a measure, recovered his\nhealth, but the ulcer on McPherson's foot had so eaten the flesh that\nthe muscles were visible. Hawes's monotonous chatter and crazy\nwhimperings filled the tent every night.\n\nThe only pleasures left them, the only breaks in the monotony of that\nlife, were to eat, and, when possible, to sleep. Thought, reason, and\nreflection dwindled in their brains. Instincts--the primitive, elemental\nimpulses of the animal--possessed them instead. To eat, to sleep, to be\nwarm--they asked nothing better. The night's supper was a vision that\ndwelt in their imaginations hour after hour throughout the entire day.\nOh, to sit about the blue flame of alcohol sputtering underneath the old\nand battered cooker of sheet-iron! To smell the delicious savour of the\nthick, boiling soup! And then the meal itself--to taste the hot, coarse,\nmeaty food; to feel that unspeakably grateful warmth and glow, that\nalmost divine sensation of satiety spreading through their poor,\nshivering bodies, and then sleep; sleep, though quivering with cold;\nsleep, though the wet searched the flesh to the very marrow; sleep,\nthough the feet burned and crisped with torture; sleep, sleep, the\ndreamless stupefaction of exhaustion, the few hours' oblivion, the day's\nshort armistice from pain!\n\nBut stronger, more insistent than even these instincts of the animal was\nthe blind, unreasoned impulse that set their faces to the southward: \"To\nget forward, to get forward.\" Answering the resistless influence of\ntheir leader, that indomitable man of iron whom no fortune could break\nnor bend, and who imposed his will upon them as it were a yoke of\nsteel--this idea became for them a sort of obsession. Forward, if it\nwere only a yard; if it were only a foot. Forward over the\nheart-breaking, rubble ice; forward against the biting, shrieking wind;\nforward in the face of the blinding snow; forward through the brittle\ncrusts and icy water; forward, although every step was an agony, though\nthe haul-rope cut like a dull knife, though their clothes were sheets of\nice. Blinded, panting, bruised, bleeding, and exhausted, dogs and men,\nanimals all, the expedition struggled forward.\n\nOne day, a little before noon, while lunch was being cooked, the sun\nbroke through the clouds, and for upward of half an hour the ice-pack\nwas one blinding, diamond glitter. Bennett ran for his sextant and got\nan observation, the first that had been possible for nearly a month. He\nworked out their latitude that same evening.\n\nThe next morning Ferriss was awakened by a touch on his shoulder.\nBennett was standing over him.\n\n\"Come outside here a moment,\" said Bennett in a low voice. \"Don't wake\nthe men.\"\n\n\"Did you get our latitude?\" asked Ferriss as the two came out of the\ntent.\n\n\"Yes, that's what I want to tell you.\"\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"Seventy-four-nineteen.\"\n\n\"Why, what do you mean?\" asked Ferriss quickly.\n\n\"Just this: That the ice-pack we're on is drifting faster to the north\nthan we are marching to the south. We are farther north now than we were\na month ago for all our marching.\"\n\n\n\n\nII.\n\n\nBy eleven o'clock at night the gale had increased to such an extent and\nthe sea had begun to build so high that it was a question whether or not\nthe whaleboat would ride the storm. Bennett finally decided that it\nwould be impossible to reach the land--stretching out in a long, dark\nblur to the southwest--that night, and that the boat must run before\nthe wind if he was to keep her afloat. The number two cutter, with\nFerriss in command, was a bad sailer, and had fallen astern. She was\nalready out of hailing distance; but Bennett, who was at the whaleboat's\ntiller, in the instant's glance that he dared to shoot behind him saw\nwith satisfaction that Ferriss had followed his example.\n\nThe whaleboat and the number two cutter were the only boats now left to\nthe expedition. The third boat had been abandoned long before they had\nreached open water.\n\nAn hour later Adler, the sailing-master, who had been bailing, and who\nsat facing Bennett, looked back through the storm; then, turning to\nBennett, said:\n\n\"Beg pardon, sir, I think they are signalling us.\"\n\nBennett did not answer, but, with his hand gripping the tiller, kept his\nface to the front, his glance alternating between the heaving prow of\nthe boat and the huge gray billows hissing with froth careering rapidly\nalongside. To pause for a moment, to vary by ever so little from the\ncourse of the storm, might mean the drowning of them all. After a few\nmoments Adler spoke again, touching his cap.\n\n\"I'm sure I see a signal, sir.\"\n\n\"No, you don't,\" answered Bennett.\n\n\"Beg pardon, I'm quite sure I do.\"\n\nBennett leaned toward him, the cast in his eyes twinkling with a wicked\nlight, the furrow between the eyebrows deepening. \"I tell you, you don't\nsee any signal; do you understand? You don't see any signal until I\nchoose to have you.\"\n\nThe night was bitter hard for the occupants of the whaleboat. In their\nweakened condition they were in no shape to fight a polar hurricane in\nan open boat.\n\nFor three weeks they had not known the meaning of full rations. During\nthe first days after the line of march over the ice had been abruptly\nchanged to the west in the hope of reaching open water, only\nthree-quarter rations had been issued, and now for the last two days\nhalf rations had been their portion. The gnawing of hunger had begun.\nEvery man was perceptibly weaker. Matters were getting desperate.\n\nBut by seven o'clock the next morning the storm had blown itself out. To\nBennett's inexpressible relief the cutter hove in view. Shaping their\ncourse to landward once more, the boats kept company, and by the middle\nof the afternoon Bennett and the crew of the whaleboat successfully\nlanded upon a bleak, desolate, and wind-scourged coast. But in some way,\nnever afterward sufficiently explained, the cutter under Ferriss's\ncommand was crushed in the floating ice within one hundred yards of the\nshore. The men and stores were landed--the water being shallow enough\nfor wading--but the boat was a hopeless wreck.\n\n\"I believe it's Cape Shelaski,\" said Bennett to Ferriss when camp had\nbeen made and their maps consulted. \"But if it is, it's charted\nthirty-five minutes too far to the west.\"\n\nBefore breaking camp the next morning Bennett left this record under a\ncairn of rocks upon the highest point of the cape, further marking the\nspot by one of the boat's flags:\n\n\"The Freja Arctic Exploring Expedition landed at this point October\n28, 1891. Our ship was nipped and sunk in 76 deg. 10 min. north\nlatitude on the l2th of July last. I then attempted a southerly\nmarch to Wrangel Island, but found such a course impracticable on\naccount of northerly drift of ice. On the lst of October I\naccordingly struck off to the westward to find open water at the\nlimit of the ice, being compelled to abandon one boat and two\nsledges on the way. A second boat was crushed beyond repair in\ndrifting ice while attempting a landing at this place. Our one\nremaining boat being too small to accommodate the members of the\nexpedition, circumstances oblige me to begin an overland march\ntoward Kolyuchin Bay, following the line of the coast. We expect\neither to winter among the Chuckch settlements mentioned by\nNordenskjold as existing upon the eastern shores of Kolyuchin Bay\nor to fall in with the relief ships or the steam whalers en route.\nBy issuing half rations I have enough provisions for eighteen days,\nand have saved all records, observations, papers, instruments, etc.\nEnclosed is the muster roll of the expedition. No scurvy as yet and\nno deaths. Our sick are William Hawes, carpenter, arctic fever,\nserious; David McPherson, seaman, ulceration of left foot, serious.\nThe general condition of the rest of the men is fair, though much\nweakened by exposure and lack of food.\n\n(Signed) \"WARD BENNETT, Commanding.\"\n\nBut during the night, their first night on land, Bennett resolved upon a\ndesperate expedient. Not only the boat was to be abandoned, but also the\nsledges, and not only the sledges, but every article of weight not\nabsolutely necessary to the existence of the party. Two weeks before,\nthe sun had set not to rise again for six months. Winter was upon them\nand darkness. The Enemy was drawing near. The great remorseless grip of\nthe Ice was closing. It was no time for half-measures and hesitation;\nnow it was life or death.\n\nThe sense of their peril, the nearness of the Enemy, strung Bennett's\nnerves taut as harp-strings. His will hardened to the flinty hardness of\nthe ice itself. His strength of mind and of body seemed suddenly to\nquadruple itself. His determination was that of the battering-ram,\nblind, deaf, resistless. The ugly set of his face became all the more\nugly, the contorted eyes flashing, the great jaw all but simian. He\nappeared physically larger. It was no longer a man; it was a giant, an\nogre, a colossal jotun hurling ice-blocks, fighting out a battle\nunspeakable, in the dawn of the world, in chaos and in darkness.\n\nThe impedimenta of the expedition were broken up into packs that each\nman carried upon his shoulders. From now on everything that hindered the\nrapidity of their movements must be left behind. Six dogs (all that\nremained of the pack of eighteen) still accompanied them.\n\nBennett had hoped and had counted upon his men for an average daily\nmarch of sixteen miles, but the winter gales driving down from the\nnortheast beat them back; the ice and snow that covered the land were no\nless uneven than the hummocks of the pack. All game had migrated far to\nthe southward.\n\nEvery day the men grew weaker and weaker; their provisions dwindled.\nAgain and again one or another of them, worn out beyond human endurance,\nwould go to sleep while marching and would fall to the ground.\n\nUpon the third day of this overland march one of the dogs suddenly\ncollapsed upon the ground, exhausted and dying. Bennett had ordered such\nof the dogs that gave out cut up and their meat added to the store of\nthe party's provisions. Ferriss and Muck Tu had started to pick up the\ndead dog when the other dogs, famished and savage, sprang upon their\nfallen mate. The two men struck and kicked, all to no purpose; the dogs\nturned upon them snarling and snapping. They, too, demanded to live;\nthey, too, wanted to be fed. It was a hideous business. There in that\nhalf-night of the polar circle, lost and forgotten on a primordial\nshore, back into the stone age once more, men and animals fought one\nanother for the privilege of eating a dead dog.\n\nBut their life was not all inhuman; Bennett at least could rise even\nabove humanity, though his men must perforce be dragged so far below it.\nAt the end of the first week Hawes, the carpenter, died. When they awoke\nin the morning he was found motionless and stiff in his sleeping-bag.\nSome sort of grave was dug, the poor racked body lowered into it, and\nbefore it was filled with snow and broken ice Bennett, standing quietly\nin the midst of the bare-headed group, opened his prayer-book and began\nwith the tremendous words, \"I am the Resurrection and the Life--\"\n\nIt was the beginning of the end. A week later the actual starvation\nbegan. Slower and slower moved the expedition on its daily march,\nfaltering, staggering, blinded and buffeted by the incessant northeast\nwinds, cruel, merciless, keen as knife-blades. Hope long since was dead;\nresolve wore thin under friction of disaster; like a rat, hunger gnawed\nat them hour after hour; the cold was one unending agony. Still Bennett\nwas unbroken, still he urged them forward. For so long as they could\nmove he would drive them on.\n\nToward four o'clock on the afternoon of one particularly hard day, word\nwas passed forward to Bennett at the head of the line that something was\nwrong in the rear.\n\n\"It's Adler; he's down again and can't get up; asks you to leave him.\"\n\nBennett halted the line and went back some little distance to find Adler\nlying prone upon his back, his eyes half closed, breathing short and\nfast. He shook him roughly by the shoulder.\n\n\"Up with you!\"\n\nAdler opened his eyes and shook his head.\n\n\"I--I'm done for this time, sir; just leave me here--please.\"\n\n\"H'up!\" shouted Bennett; \"you're not done for; I know better.\"\n\n\"Really, sir, I--I _can't_.\"\n\n\"H'up!\"\n\n\"If you would only please--for God's sake, sir. It's more than I'm made\nfor.\"\n\nBennett kicked him in the side.\n\n\"H'up with you!\"\n\nAdler struggled to his feet again, Bennett aiding him.\n\n\"Now, then, can you go five yards?\"\n\n\"I think--I don't know--perhaps--\"\n\n\"Go them, then.\"\n\nThe other moved forward.\n\n\"Can you go five more; answer, speak up, can you?\"\n\nAdler nodded his head.\n\n\"Go them--and another five--and another--there--that's something like a\nman, and let's have no more woman's drivel about dying.\"\n\n\"But--\"\n\nBennett came close to him, shaking a forefinger in his face, thrusting\nforward his chin wickedly.\n\n\"My friend, I'll drive you like a dog, but,\" his fist clenched in the\nman's face, \"I'll _make_ you pull through.\"\n\nTwo hours later Adler finished the day's march at the head of the line.\n\nThe expedition began to eat its dogs. Every evening Bennett sent Muck Tu\nand Adler down to the shore to gather shrimps, though fifteen hundred of\nthese shrimps hardly filled a gill measure. The party chewed\nreindeer-moss growing in scant patches in the snow-buried rocks, and at\ntimes made a thin, sickly infusion from the arctic willow. Again and\nagain Bennett despatched the Esquimau and Clarke, the best shots in the\nparty, on hunting expeditions to the southward. Invariably they returned\nempty-handed. Occasionally they reported old tracks of reindeer and\nfoxes, but the winter colds had driven everything far inland. Once only\nClarke shot a snow-bunting, a little bird hardly bigger than a sparrow.\nStill Bennett pushed forward.\n\nOne morning in the beginning of the third week, after a breakfast of two\nounces of dog meat and a half cup of willow tea, Ferriss and Bennett\nfound themselves a little apart from the others. The men were engaged in\nlowering the tent. Ferriss glanced behind to be assured he was out of\nhearing, then:\n\n\"How about McPherson?\" he said in a low voice.\n\nMcPherson's foot was all but eaten to the bone by now. It was a miracle\nhow the man had kept up thus far. But at length he had begun to fall\nbehind; every day he straggled more and more, and the previous evening\nhad reached camp nearly an hour after the tent had been pitched. But he\nwas a plucky fellow, of sterner stuff than the sailing-master, Adler,\nand had no thought of giving up.\n\nBennett made no reply to Ferriss, and the chief engineer did not repeat\nthe question. The day's march began; almost at once breast-high\nsnowdrifts were encountered, and when these had been left behind the\nexpedition involved itself upon the precipitate slopes of a huge talus\nof ice and bare, black slabs of basalt. Fully two hours were spent in\nclambering over this obstacle, and on its top Bennett halted to breathe\nthe men. But when they started forward again it was found that McPherson\ncould not keep his feet. When he had fallen, Adler and Dennison had\nendeavoured to lift him, but they themselves were so weak that they,\ntoo, fell. Dennison could not rise of his own efforts, and instead of\nhelping McPherson had to be aided himself. Bennett came forward, put an\narm about McPherson, and hauled him to an upright position. The man took\na step forward, but his left foot immediately doubled under him, and he\ncame to the ground again. Three times this manoeuvre was repeated; so\nfar from marching, McPherson could not even stand.\n\n\"If I could have a day's rest--\" began McPherson, unsteadily. Bennett\ncast a glance at Dennison, the doctor. Dennison shook his head. The\nfoot, the entire leg below the knee, should have been amputated days\nago. A month's rest even in a hospital at home would have benefited\nMcPherson nothing.\n\nFor the fraction of a minute Bennett debated the question, then he\nturned to the command.\n\n\"Forward, men!\"\n\n\"What--wh--\" began McPherson, sitting upon the ground, looking from one\nface to another, bewildered, terrified. Some of the men began to move\noff.\n\n\"Wait--wait,\" exclaimed the cripple, \"I--I can get along--I--\" He rose\nto his knees, made, a great effort to regain his footing, and once more\ncame crashing down upon the ice.\n\n\"Forward!\"\n\n\"But--but--but--_Oh, you're not going to leave me, sir_?\"\n\n\"Forward!\"\n\n\"He's been my chum, sir, all through the voyage,\" said one of the men,\ntouching his cap to Bennett; \"I had just as soon be left with him. I'm\nabout done myself.\"\n\nAnother joined in:\n\n\"I'll stay, too--I can't leave--it's--it's too terrible.\"\n\nThere was a moment's hesitation. Those who had begun to move on halted.\nThe whole expedition wavered.\n\nBennett caught the dog-whip from Muck Tu's hand. His voice rang like the\nalarm of a trumpet.\n\n\"Forward!\"\n\nOnce more Bennett's discipline prevailed. His iron hand shut down upon\nhis men, more than ever resistless. Obediently they turned their faces\nto the southward. The march was resumed.\n\nAnother day passed, then two. Still the expedition struggled on. With\nevery hour their sufferings increased. It did not seem that anything\nhuman could endure such stress and yet survive. Toward three o'clock in\nthe morning of the third night Adler woke Bennett.\n\n\"It's Clarke, sir; he and I sleep in the same bag. I think he's going,\nsir.\"\n\nOne by one the men in the tent were awakened, and the train-oil lamp was\nlit.\n\nClarke lay in his sleeping-bag unconscious, and at long intervals\ndrawing a faint, quick breath. The doctor bent over him, feeling his\npulse, but shook his head hopelessly.\n\n\"He's dying--quietly--exhaustion from starvation.\"\n\nA few moments later Clarke began to tremble slightly, the mouth opened\nwide; a faint rattle came from the throat.\n\nFour miles was as much as could be made good the next day, and this\nthough the ground was comparatively smooth. Ferriss was continually\nfalling. Dennison and Metz were a little light-headed, and Bennett at\none time wondered if Ferriss himself had absolute control of his wits.\nSince morning the wind had been blowing strongly in their faces. By noon\nit had increased. At four o'clock a violent gale was howling over the\nreaches of ice and rock-ribbed land. It was impossible to go forward\nwhile it lasted. The stronger gusts fairly carried their feet from under\nthem. At half-past four the party halted. The gale was now a hurricane.\nThe expedition paused, collected itself, went forward; halted again,\nagain attempted to move, and came at last to a definite standstill in\nwhirling snow-clouds and blinding, stupefying blasts.\n\n\"Pitch the tent!\" said Bennett quietly. \"We must wait now till it blows\nover.\"\n\nIn the lee of a mound of ice-covered rock some hundred yards from the\ncoast the tent was pitched, and supper, such as it was, eaten in\nsilence. All knew what this enforced halt must mean for them. That\nsupper--each man could hold his portion in the hollow of one hand--was\nthe last of their regular provisions. March they could not. What now?\nBefore crawling into their sleeping-bags, and at Bennett's request, all\njoined in repeating the Creed and the Lord's Prayer.\n\nThe next day passed, and the next, and the next. The gale continued\nsteadily. The southerly march was discontinued. All day and all night\nthe men kept in the tent, huddled in the sleeping-bags, sometimes\nsleeping eighteen and twenty hours out of the twenty-four. They lost all\nconsciousness of the lapse of time; sensation even of suffering left\nthem; the very hunger itself had ceased to gnaw. Only Bennett and\nFerriss seemed to keep their heads. Then slowly the end began.\n\nFor that last week Bennett's entries in his ice-journal were as follows:\n\n\"November 29th--Monday--Camped at 4:30 p.m. about 100 yards from the\ncoast. Open water to the eastward as far as I can see. If I had not\nbeen compelled to abandon my boats--but it is useless to repine. I\nmust look our situation squarely in the face. At noon served out\nlast beef-extract, which we drank with some willow tea. Our\nremaining provisions consist of four-fifteenths of a pound of\npemmican per man, and the rest of the dog meat. Where are the\nrelief ships? We should at least have met the steam whalers long\nbefore this.\n\n\"November 30th--Tuesday--The doctor amputated Mr. Ferriss's other\nhand to-day. Living gale of wind from northeast. Impossible to\nmarch against it in our weakened condition; must camp here till it\nabates. Made soup of the last of the dog meat this afternoon. Our\nlast pemmican gone.\n\n\"December lst--Wednesday--Everybody getting weaker. Metz breaking\ndown. Sent Adler down to the shore to gather shrimps. We had about\na mouthful apiece for lunch. Supper, a spoonful of glycerine and\nhot water.\n\n\"December 2d--Thursday--Metz died during the night. Hansen dying.\nStill blowing a gale from the northeast. A hard night.\n\n\"December 3d--Friday--Hansen died during early morning. Muck Tu shot\na ptarmigan. Made soup. Dennison breaking down.\n\n\"December 4th--Saturday--Buried Hansen under slabs of ice. Spoonful\nof glycerine and hot water at noon.\n\n\"December 5th--Sunday--Dennison found dead this morning between\nAdler and myself. Too weak to bury him, or even carry him out of\nthe tent. He must lie where he is. Divine services at 5:30\nP.M. Last spoonful of glycerine and hot water.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe next day was Monday, and at some indeterminate hour of the\ntwenty-four, though whether it was night or noon he could not say,\nFerriss woke in his sleeping-bag and raised himself on an elbow, and for\na moment sat stupidly watching Bennett writing in his journal. Noticing\nthat he was awake, Bennett looked up from the page and spoke in a voice\nthick and muffled because of the swelling of his tongue.\n\n\"How long has this wind been blowing, Ferriss?\"\n\n\"Since a week ago to-day,\" answered the other.\n\nBennett continued his writing.\n\n\"...Incessant gales of wind for over a week. Impossible to move\nagainst them in our weakened condition. But to stay here is to\nperish. God help us. It is the end of everything.\"\n\nBennett drew a line across the page under the last entry, and, still\nholding the book in his hand, gazed slowly about the tent.\n\nThere were six of them left--five huddled together in that miserable\ntent--the sixth, Adler, being down on the shore gathering shrimps. In\nthe strange and gloomy half-light that filled the tent these survivors\nof the Freja looked less like men than beasts. Their hair and beards\nwere long, and seemed one with the fur covering of their bodies. Their\nfaces were absolutely black with dirt, and their limbs were monstrously\ndistended and fat--fat as things bloated and swollen are fat. It was the\nabnormal fatness of starvation, the irony of misery, the huge joke that\narctic famine plays upon those whom it afterward destroys. The men moved\nabout at times on their hands and knees; their tongues were distended,\nround, and slate-coloured, like the tongues of parrots, and when they\nspoke they bit them helplessly.\n\nNear the flap of the tent lay the swollen dead body of Dennison. Two of\nthe party dozed inert and stupefied in their sleeping-bags. Muck Tu was\nin the corner of the tent boiling his sealskin footnips over the\nsheet-iron cooker. Ferriss and Bennett sat on opposite sides of the\ntent, Bennett using his knee as a desk, Ferriss trying to free himself\nfrom the sleeping-bag with the stumps of his arms. Upon one of these\nstumps, the right one, a tin spoon had been lashed.\n\nThe tent was full of foul smells. The smell of drugs and of mouldy\ngunpowder, the smell of dirty rags, of unwashed bodies, the smell of\nstale smoke, of scorching sealskin, of soaked and rotting canvas that\nexhaled from the tent cover--every smell but that of food.\n\nOutside the unleashed wind yelled incessantly, like a sabbath of\nwitches, and spun about the pitiful shelter and went rioting past,\nleaping and somersaulting from rock to rock, tossing handfuls of dry,\ndust-like snow into the air; folly-stricken, insensate, an enormous, mad\nmonster gambolling there in some hideous dance of death, capricious,\nheadstrong, pitiless as a famished wolf.\n\nIn front of the tent and over a ridge of barren rocks was an arm of the\nsea dotted with blocks of ice moving silently and swiftly onward; while\nback from the coast, and back from the tent and to the south and to the\nwest and to the east, stretched the illimitable waste of land, rugged,\ngray, harsh; snow and ice and rock, rock and ice and snow, stretching\naway there under the sombre sky forever and forever; gloomy, untamed,\nterrible, an empty region--the scarred battlefield of chaotic forces,\nthe savage desolation of a prehistoric world.\n\n\"Where's Adler?\" asked Ferriss.\n\n\"He's away after shrimps,\" responded Bennett.\n\nBennett's eyes returned to his journal and rested on the open page\nthoughtfully.\n\n\"Do you know what I've just written here, Ferriss?\" he asked, adding\nwithout waiting for an answer: \"I've written 'It's the end of\neverything.'\"\n\n\"I suppose it is,\" admitted Ferriss, looking about the tent.\n\n\"Yes, the end of everything. It's come--at last.... Well.\" There was a\nlong silence. One of the men in the sleeping-bags groaned and turned\nupon his face. Outside the wind lapsed suddenly to a prolonged sigh of\ninfinite sadness, clamouring again upon the instant.\n\n\"Dick,\" said Bennett, returning his journal to the box of records, \"it\n_is_ the end of everything, and just because it is I want to talk to\nyou--to ask you something.\"\n\nFerriss came nearer. The horrid shouting of the wind deadened the sound\nof their voices; the others could not hear, and by now it would have\nmattered very little to any of them if they had.\n\n\"Dick,\" began Bennett, \"nothing makes much difference now. In a few\nhours we shall all be like Dennison here;\" he tapped the body of the\ndoctor, who had died during the night. It was already frozen so hard\nthat his touch upon it resounded as if it had been a log of wood. \"We\nshall be like this pretty soon. But before--well, while I can, I want to\nask you something about Lloyd Searight. You've known her all your life,\nand you saw her later than I did before we left. You remember I had to\ncome to the ship two days before you, about the bilge pumps.\"\n\nWhile Bennett had been speaking Ferriss had been sitting very erect upon\nhis sleeping-bag, drawing figures and vague patterns in the fur of his\ndeer-skin coat with the tip of the tin spoon. Yes, Bennett was right; he,\nFerriss, had known her all his life, and it was no doubt because of this\nvery fact that she had come to be so dear to him. But he had not always\nknown it, had never discovered his love for her until the time was at\nhand to say good-bye, to leave her for this mad dash for the Pole. It\nhad been too late to speak then, and Ferriss had never told her. She was\nnever to know that he too--like Bennett--cared.\n\n\"It seems rather foolish,\" continued Bennett clumsily, \"but if I thought\nshe had ever cared for me--in that way--why, it would make this that is\ncoming to us seem--I don't know--easier to be borne perhaps. I say it\nvery badly, but it would not be so hard to die if I thought she had ever\nloved me--a bit.\"\n\nFerriss was thinking very fast. Why was it he had never guessed\nsomething like this? But in Ferriss's mind the idea of the love of a\nwoman had never associated itself with Bennett, that great, harsh man of\ncolossal frame, so absorbed in his huge projects, so welded to his\nsingle aim, furthering his purposes to the exclusion of every other\nthought, desire, or emotion. Bennett was a man's man. But here Ferriss\nchecked himself. Bennett himself had called her a man's woman, a grand,\nsplendid man's woman. He was right; he was right. She was no less than\nthat; small wonder, after all, that Bennett had been attracted to her.\nWhat a pair they were, strong, masterful both, insolent in the\nconsciousness of their power!\n\n\"You have known her so well and for so long,\" continued Bennett, \"that I\nam sure she must have said something to you about me. Tell me, did she\never say anything--or not that--but imply in her manner, give you to\nunderstand that she would have married me if I had asked her?\"\n\nFerriss found time, even in such an hour, to wonder at the sudden and\nunexpected break in the uniform hardness of Bennett's character. Ferriss\nknew him well by now. Bennett was not a man to ask concessions, to catch\nat small favours. What he wanted he took with an iron hand, without ruth\nand without scruple. But in the unspeakable dissolution in which they\nwere now involved did anything make a difference? The dreadful mill in\nwhich they had been ground had crushed from them all petty distinctions\nof personality, individuality. Humanity--the elements of character\ncommon to all men--only remained.\n\nBut Ferriss was puzzled as to how he should answer Bennett. On the one\nhand was the woman he loved, and on the other Bennett, his best friend,\nhis chief, his hero. They, too, had lived together for so long, had\nfought out the fight with the Enemy shoulder to shoulder, had battled\nwith the same dangers, had dared the same sufferings, had undergone the\nsame defeats and disappointments.\n\nFerriss felt himself in grievous straits. Must he tell Bennett the\ntruth? Must this final disillusion be added to that long train of\nothers, the disasters, the failures, the disappointments, and deferred\nhopes of all those past months? Must Bennett die hugging to his heart\nthis bitterness as well?\n\n\"I sometimes thought,\" observed Bennett with a weak smile, \"that she did\ncare a little. I've surely seen something like that in her eyes at\ncertain moments. I wish I had spoken. Did she ever say anything to you?\nDo you think she would have married me if I had asked her?\" He paused,\nwaiting for an answer.\n\n\"Oh--yes,\" hazarded Ferriss, driven to make some sort of response,\nhoping to end the conversation; \"yes, I think she would.\"\n\n\"You do?\" said Bennett quickly. \"You think she would? What did she say?\nDid she ever say anything to you?\"\n\nThe thing was too cruel; Ferriss shrank from it. But suddenly an idea\noccurred to him. Did anything make any difference now? Why not tell his\nfriend that which he wanted to hear, even if it were not the truth?\nAfter all that Bennett had suffered why could he not die content at\nleast in this? What did it matter if he spoke? Did anything matter at\nsuch a time when they were all to die within the next twenty-four hours?\nBennett was looking straight into his eyes; there was no time to think\nof consequences. Consequences? But there were to be _no_ consequences.\nThis was the end. Yet could Ferriss make Bennett receive such an\nuntruth? Ferriss did not believe that Lloyd cared for Bennett; knew that\nshe did not, in fact, and if she had cared, did Bennett think for an\ninstant that she--of all women--would have confessed the fact, confessed\nit to him, Bennett's most intimate friend? Ferriss had known Lloyd well\nfor a long time, had at last come to love her. But could he himself tell\nwhether or no Lloyd cared for him? No, he could not, certainly he could\nnot.\n\nMeanwhile Bennett was waiting for his answer. Ferriss's mind was all\nconfused. He could no longer distinguish right from wrong. If the lie\nwould make Bennett happier in this last hour of his life, why not tell\nthe lie?\n\n\"Yes,\" answered Ferriss, \"she did say something once.\"\n\n\"She did?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" continued Ferriss slowly, trying to invent the most plausible\nlie. \"We had been speaking of the expedition and of you. I don't know\nhow the subject was brought up, but it came in very naturally at length.\nShe said--yes, I recall it. She said: 'You must bring him back to me.\nRemember he is everything to me--everything in the world.'\"\n\n\"She--\" Bennett cleared his throat, then tugged at his mustache; \"she\nsaid that?\"\n\nFerriss nodded.\n\n\"Ah!\" said Bennett with a quick breath, then he added: \"I'm glad of\nthat; you haven't any idea how glad I am, Dick--in spite of everything.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, I guess I have,\" murmured Ferriss.\n\n\"No, no, indeed, you haven't,\" returned the other. \"One has to love a\nwoman like that, Dick, and have her--and find out--and have things come\nright, to appreciate it. She would have been my wife after all. I don't\nknow how to thank you, Dick. Congratulate me.\"\n\nHe rose, holding out his hand; Ferriss feebly rose, too, and\ninstinctively extended his arm, but withdrew it suddenly. Bennett paused\nabruptly, letting his hand fall to his side, and the two men remained\nthere an instant, looking at the stumps of Ferriss's arms, the tin spoon\nstill lashed to the right wrist.\n\nA few hours later Bennett noted that the gale had begun perceptibly to\nabate. By afternoon he was sure that the storm would be over. As he\nturned to re-enter the tent after reading the wind-gauge he noted that\nKamiska, their one remaining dog, had come back, and was sitting on a\nprojection of ice a little distance away, uncertain as to her reception\nafter her absence. Bennett was persuaded that Kamiska had not run away.\nOf all the Ostiaks she had been the most faithful. Bennett chose to\nbelieve that she had wandered from the tent and had lost herself in the\nblinding snow. But here was food. Kamiska could be killed; life could be\nprolonged a day or two, perhaps three, while the strongest man of the\nparty, carrying the greater portion of the dog meat on his shoulders,\ncould push forward and, perhaps, after all, reach Kolyuchin Bay and the\nChuckch settlements and return with aid. But who could go? Assuredly not\nFerriss, so weak he could scarcely keep on his feet; not Adler, who at\ntimes was delirious, and who needed the discipline of a powerful leader\nto keep him to his work; Muck Tu, the Esquimau, could not be trusted\nwith the lives of all of them, and the two remaining men were in all but\na dying condition. Only one man of them all was equal to the task, only\none of them who still retained his strength of body and mind; he\nhimself, Bennett. Yes, but to abandon his men?\n\nHe crawled into the tent again to get the rifle with which to shoot the\ndog, but, suddenly possessed of an idea, paused for a moment, seated on\nthe sleeping-bag, his head in his hands.\n\nBeaten? Was he beaten at last? Had the Enemy conquered? Had the Ice\nenclosed him in its vast, remorseless grip? Then once more his\ndetermination grew big within him, for a last time that iron will rose\nup in mighty protest of defeat. No, no, no; he was not beaten; he would\nlive; he, the strongest, the fittest, would survive. Was it not right\nthat the mightiest should live? Was it not the great law of nature? He\nknew himself to be strong enough to move; to march, perhaps, for two\nwhole days; and now food had come to them, to him. Yes, but to abandon\nhis men?\n\nHe had left McPherson, it is true; but then the lives of all of them had\nbeen involved--one life against eleven. Now he was thinking only of\nhimself. But Ferriss--no, he could not leave Ferriss. Ferriss would come\nwith him. They would share the dog meat between them--the whole of it.\nHe, with Ferriss, would push on. He would reach Kolyuchin Bay and the\nsettlements. He would be saved; he would reach home; would come\nback--come back to Lloyd, who loved him. Yes, but to abandon his men?\n\nThen Bennett's great fist closed, closed and smote heavily upon his\nknee.\n\n\"No,\" he said decisively.\n\nHe had spoken his thoughts aloud, and Ferriss, who had crawled into his\nsleeping-bag again, looked at him curiously. Even Muck Tu turned his\nhead from the sickening mess reeking upon the cooker. There was a noise\nof feet at the flap of the tent.\n\n\"It's Adler,\" muttered Ferriss.\n\nAdler tore open the flap.\n\nThen he shouted to Bennett: \"Three steam whalers off the foot of the\nfloe, sir; boat putting off! What orders, sir?\"\n\nBennett looked at him stupidly, as yet without definite thought.\n\n\"What did you say?\"\n\nThe men in the sleeping-bags, roused by Adler's shout, sat up and\nlistened stolidly.\n\n\"Steam whalers?\" said Bennett slowly. \"Where? I guess not,\" he added,\nshaking his head.\n\nAdler was swaying in his place with excitement.\n\n\"Three whalers,\" he repeated, \"close in. They've put off--oh, my God!\nListen to that.\"\n\nThe unmistakable sound of a steamer's whistle, raucous and prolonged,\ncame to their ears from the direction of the coast. One of the men broke\ninto a feeble cheer. The whole tent was rousing up. Again and again came\nthe hoarse, insistent cry of the whistle.\n\n\"What orders, sir?\" repeated Adler.\n\nA clamour of voices filled the tent.\n\nFerriss came quickly up to Bennett, trying to make himself heard.\n\n\"Listen!\" he cried with eager intentness, \"what I told you--a while\nago--about Lloyd--I thought--it's all a mistake, you don't understand--\"\n\nBennett was not listening.\n\n\"What orders, sir?\" exclaimed Adler for the third time.\n\nBennett drew himself up.\n\n\"My compliments to the officer in command. Tell him there are six of us\nleft--tell him--oh, tell him anything you damn please. Men,\" he cried,\nhis harsh face suddenly radiant, \"make ready to get out of this! We're\ngoing home, going home to those who love us, men.\"\n\n\n\n\nIII.\n\n\nAs Lloyd Searight turned into Calumet Square on her way from the\nbookseller's, with her purchases under her arm, she was surprised to\nnotice a drop of rain upon the back of one of her white gloves. She\nlooked up quickly; the sun was gone. On the east side of the square,\nunder the trees, the houses that at this hour of the afternoon should\nhave been overlaid with golden light were in shadow. The heat that had\nbeen palpitating through all the City's streets since early morning was\nswiftly giving place to a certain cool and odorous dampness. There was\neven a breeze beginning to stir in the tops of the higher elms. As the\ndrops began to thicken upon the warm, sun-baked asphalt under foot Lloyd\nsharply quickened her pace. But the summer storm was coming up rapidly.\nBy the time she reached the great granite-built agency on the opposite\nside of the square she was all but running, and as she put her key in\nthe door the rain swept down with a prolonged and muffled roar.\n\nShe let herself into the spacious, airy hallway of the agency, shutting\nthe door by leaning against it, and stood there for an instant to get\nher breath. Rownie, the young mulatto girl, one of the servants of the\nhouse, who was going upstairs with an armful of clean towels, turned\nabout at the closing of the door and called:\n\n\"Jus' in time, Miss Lloyd; jus' in time. I reckon Miss Wakeley and Miss\nEsther Thielman going to get for sure wet. They ain't neither one of 'em\ntook ary umberel.\"\n\n\"Did Miss Wakeley and Miss Thielman both go out?\" demanded Lloyd\nquickly. \"Did they both go on a call?\"\n\n\"Yes, Miss Lloyd,\" answered Rownie. \"I don't know because why Miss\nWakeley went, but Miss Esther Thielman got a typhoid call--another one.\nThat's three f'om this house come next Sunday week. I reckon Miss\nWakeley going out meks you next on call, Miss Lloyd.\"\n\nWhile Rownie had been speaking Lloyd had crossed the hall to where the\nroster of the nurses' names, in little movable slides, hung against the\nwall. As often as a nurse was called out she removed her name from the\ntop of this list and slid it into place at the bottom, so that whoever\nfound her name at the top of the roster knew that she was \"next on call\"\nand prepared herself accordingly.\n\nLloyd's name was now at the top of the list. She had not been gone five\nminutes from the agency, and it was rare for two nurses to be called out\nin so short a time.\n\n\"Is it your tu'n?\" asked Rownie as Lloyd faced quickly about.\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" answered Lloyd, running up the stairs, adding, as she passed\nthe mulatto: \"There's been no call sent in since Miss Thielman left, has\nthere, Rownie?\" Rownie shook her head.\n\nLloyd went directly to her room, tossed her books aside without removing\nthe wrappers, and set about packing her satchel. When this was done she\nchanged her tailor-made street dress and crisp skirt for clothes that\nwould not rustle when she moved, and put herself neatly to rights,\nstripping off her rings and removing the dog-violets from her waist.\nThen she went to the round, old-fashioned mirror that hung between the\nwindows of her room, and combed back her hair in a great roll from her\nforehead and temples, and stood there a moment or so when she had done,\nlooking at her reflection.\n\nShe was tall and of a very vigorous build, full-throated, deep-chested,\nwith large, strong hands and solid, round wrists. Her face was rather\nserious; one did not expect her to smile easily; the eyes dull blue,\nwith no trace of sparkle and set deep under heavy, level eyebrows. Her\nmouth was the mouth of the obstinate, of the strong-willed, and her chin\nwas not small. But her hair was a veritable glory, a dull-red flame,\nthat bore back from her face in one great solid roll, dull red, like\ncopper or old bronze, thick, heavy, almost gorgeous in its sombre\nradiance. Dull-red hair, dull-blue eyes, and a faint, dull glow forever\non her cheeks, Lloyd was a beautiful woman; much about her that was\nregal, for she was very straight as well as very tall, and could look\ndown upon most women and upon not a few men.\n\nLloyd turned from the mirror, laying down the comb. She had yet to pack\nher nurse's bag, or, since this was always ready, to make sure that none\nof its equipment was lacking. She was very proud of this bag, as she had\ncaused it to be made after her own ideas and design. It was of black\nrussia leather and in the form of an ordinary valise, but set off with a\nfine silver clasp bearing her name and the agency's address. She brought\nit from the closet and ran over its contents, murmuring the while to\nherself:\n\n\"Clinical thermometer--brandy--hypodermic syringe--vial of oxalic-acid\ncrystals--minim-glass--temperature charts; yes, yes, everything right.\"\n\nWhile she was still speaking Miss Douglass, the fever nurse, knocked at\nher door, and, finding it ajar, entered without further ceremony.\n\n\"Are you in, Miss Searight?\" called Miss Douglass, looking about the\nroom, for Lloyd had returned to the closet and was busy washing the\nminim-glass.\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" cried Lloyd, \"I am. Sit down.\"\n\n\"Rownie told me you are next on call,\" said the other, dropping on\nLloyd's couch.\n\n\"So I am; I was very nearly caught, too. I ran over across the square\nfor five minutes, and while I was gone Miss Wakeley and Esther Thielman\nwere called. My name is at the top now.\"\n\n\"Esther got a typhoid case from Dr. Pitts. Do you know, Lloyd,\nthat's--let me see, that's four--seven--nine--that's ten typhoid cases\nin the City that I can think of right now.\"\n\n\"It's everywhere; yes, I know,\" answered Lloyd, coming out of the room,\ncarefully drying the minim-glass.\n\n\"We are going to have trouble with it,\" continued the fever nurse;\n\"plenty of it before cool weather comes. It's almost epidemic.\"\n\nLloyd held the minim-glass against the light, scrutinising it with\nnarrowed lids.\n\n\"What did Esther say when she knew it was an infectious case?\" she\nasked. \"Did she hesitate at all?\"\n\n\"Not she!\" declared Miss Douglass. \"She's no Harriet Freeze.\"\n\nLloyd did not answer. This case of Harriet Freeze was one that the\nnurses of the house had never forgotten and would never forgive. Miss\nFreeze, a young English woman, newly graduated, suddenly called upon to\nnurse a patient stricken with smallpox, had flinched and had been found\nwanting at the crucial moment, had discovered an excuse for leaving her\npost, having once accepted it. It was cowardice in the presence of the\nEnemy. Anything could have been forgiven but that. On the girl's return\nto the agency nothing was said, no action taken, but for all that she\nwas none the less expelled dishonourably from the midst of her\ncompanions. Nothing could have been stronger than the _esprit de corps_\nof this group of young women, whose lives were devoted to an unending\nbattle with disease.\n\nLloyd continued the overhauling of her equipment, and began ruling forms\nfor nourishment charts, while Miss Douglass importuned her to subscribe\nto a purse the nurses were making up for an old cripple dying of cancer.\nLloyd refused.\n\n\"You know very well, Miss Douglass, that I only give to charity through\nthe association.\"\n\n\"I know,\" persisted the other, \"and I know you give twice as much as all\nof us put together, but with this poor old fellow it's different. We\nknow all about him, and every one of us in the house has given\nsomething. You are the only one that won't, Lloyd, and I had so hoped I\ncould make it tip to fifty dollars.\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"We need only three dollars now. We can buy that little cigar stand for\nhim for fifty dollars.\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"And you won't give us just three dollars?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Well, you give half and I'll give half,\" said Miss Douglass.\n\n\"Do you think it's a question of money with me?\" Lloyd smiled.\n\nIndeed this was a poor argument with which to move Lloyd--Lloyd whose\nrailroad stock alone brought her some fifteen thousand dollars a year.\n\n\"Well, no; I don't mean that, of course, but, Lloyd, do let us have\nthree dollars, and I can send word to the old chap this very afternoon.\nIt will make him happy for the rest of his life.\"\n\n\"No--no--no, not three dollars, nor three cents.\"\n\nMiss Douglass made a gesture of despair. She might have expected that\nshe could not move Lloyd. Once her mind was made up, one might argue\nwith her till one's breath failed. She shook her head at Lloyd and\nexclaimed, but not ill-naturedly:\n\n\"Obstinate! Obstinate! Obstinate!\"\n\nLloyd put away the hypodermic syringe and the minim-glass in their\nplaces in the bag, added a little ice-pick to its contents, and shut the\nbag with a snap.\n\n\"Now,\" she announced, \"I'm ready.\"\n\nWhen Miss Douglass had taken herself away Lloyd settled herself in the\nplace she had vacated, and, stripping the wrappings from the books and\nmagazines she had bought, began to turn the pages, looking at the\npictures. But her interest flagged. She tried to read, but soon cast the\nbook from her and leaned back upon the great couch, her hands clasped\nbehind the great bronze-red coils at the back of her head, her dull-blue\neyes fixed and vacant.\n\nFor hours the preceding night she had lain broad awake in her bed,\nstaring at the shifting shadow pictures that the electric lights,\nshining through the trees down in the square, threw upon the walls and\nceiling of her room. She had eaten but little since morning; a growing\nspirit of unrest had possessed her for the last two days. Now it had\nreached a head. She could no longer put her thoughts from her.\n\nIt had all come back again for the fiftieth time, for the hundredth\ntime, the old, intolerable burden of anxiety growing heavier month by\nmonth, year by year. It seemed to her that a shape of terror, formless,\nintangible, and invisible, was always by her, now withdrawing, now\nadvancing, but always there; there close at hand in some dark corner\nwhere she could not see, ready at every instant to assume a terrible and\nall too well-known form, and to jump at her from behind, from out the\ndark, and to clutch her throat with cold fingers. The thing played with\nher, tormented her; at times it all but disappeared; at times she\nbelieved she had fought it from her for good, and then she would wake of\na night, in the stillness and in the dark, and know it to be there once\nmore--at her bedside--at her back--at her throat--till her heart went\nwild with fear, and the suspense of waiting for an Enemy that would not\nstrike, but that lurked and leered in dark corners, wrung from her a\nsuppressed cry of anguish and exasperation, and drove her from her sleep\nwith streaming eyes and tight-shut hands and wordless prayers.\n\nFor a few moments Lloyd lay back upon the couch, then regained her feet\nwith a brusque, harassed movement of head and shoulders.\n\n\"Ah, no,\" she exclaimed under her breath, \"it is too dreadful.\"\n\nShe tried to find diversion in her room, rearranging the few ornaments,\nwinding the clock that struck ships' bells instead of hours, and turning\nthe wicks of the old empire lamps that hung in brass brackets on either\nside the fireplace. Lloyd, after building the agency, had felt no\nscruple in choosing the best room in the house and furnishing it\naccording to her taste. Her room was beautiful, but very simple in its\nappointments. There were great flat wall-space unspoiled by bric-\u00c3\u00a0-brac,\nthe floor marquetry, with but few rugs. The fireplace and its\nappurtenances were of brass. Her writing-desk, a huge affair, of ancient\nand almost black San Domingo mahogany.\n\nBut soon she wearied of the small business of pottering about her clock\nand lamps, and, turning to the window, opened it, and, leaning upon her\nelbows, looked down into the square.\n\nBy now the thunderstorm was gone, like the withdrawal of a dark curtain;\nthe sun was out again over the City. The square, deserted but half an\nhour ago, was reinvaded with its little people of nurse-maids,\ngray-coated policemen, and loungers reading their papers on the benches\nnear the fountain. The elms still dripped, their wet leaves glistening\nagain to the sun. There was a delicious smell in the air--a smell of\nwarm, wet grass, of leaves and drenched bark from the trees. On the far\nside of the square, seen at intervals in the spaces between the foliage,\na passing truck painted vermilion set a brisk note of colour in the\nscene. A newsboy appeared chanting the evening editions. On a sudden and\nfrom somewhere close at hand an unseen hand-piano broke out into a gay,\njangling quickstep, marking the time with delightful precision.\n\nA carriage, its fine lacquered flanks gleaming in the sunlight, rolled\nthrough the square, on its way, no doubt, to the very fashionable\nquarter of the City just beyond. Lloyd had a glimpse of the girl leaning\nback in its cushions, a girl of her own age, with whom she had some\nslight acquaintance. For a moment Lloyd, ridden with her terrors, asked\nherself if this girl, with no capabilities for either great happiness or\ngreat sorrow, were not perhaps, after all, happier than she. But she\nrecoiled instantly, murmuring to herself with a certain fierce energy:\n\n\"No, no; after all, I have lived.\"\n\nAnd how had she lived? For the moment Lloyd was willing to compare\nherself with the girl in the landau. Swiftly she ran over her own life\nfrom the time when left an orphan; in the year of her majority she had\nbecome her own mistress and the mistress of the Searight estate. But\neven at that time she had long since broken away from the conventional\nworld she had known. Lloyd was a nurse in the great St Luke's Hospital\neven then, had been a probationer there at the time of her mother's\ndeath, six months before. She had always been ambitious, but vaguely so,\nhaving no determined object in view. She recalled how at that time she\nknew only that she was in love with her work, her chosen profession, and\nwas accounted the best operating nurse in the ward.\n\nShe remembered, too, the various steps of her advancement, the positions\nshe had occupied; probationer first, then full member of the active\ncorps, next operating nurse, then ward manager, and, after her\ngraduation, head nurse of ward four, where the maternity cases were\ntreated. Then had come the time when she had left the hospital and\npractised private nursing by herself, and at last, not so long ago, the\nday when her Idea had so abruptly occurred to her; when her ambition, no\nlonger vague, no longer personal, had crystallised and taken shape; when\nshe had discovered a use for her money and had built and founded the\nhouse on Calumet Square. For a time she had been the superintendent of\nnurses here, until her own theories and ideas had obtained and prevailed\nin its management. Then, her work fairly started, she had resigned her\nposition to an older woman, and had taken her place in the rank and file\nof the nurses themselves. She wished to be one of them, living the same\nlife, subject to the same rigorous discipline, and to that end she had\nnever allowed it to be known that she was the founder of the house. The\nother nurses knew that she was very rich, very independent and\nself-reliant, but that was all. Lloyd did not know and cared very little\nhow they explained the origin and support of the agency.\n\nLloyd was animated by no great philanthropy, no vast love of humanity in\nher work; only she wanted, with all her soul she wanted, to count in the\ngeneral economy of things; to choose a work and do it; to help on,\n_donner un coup d'epaule_; and this, supported by her own stubborn\nenergy and her immense wealth, she felt that she was doing. To do things\nhad become her creed; to do things, not to think them; to do things, not\nto talk them; to do things, not to read them. No matter how lofty the\nthoughts, how brilliant the talk, how beautiful the literature--for her,\nfirst, last, and always, were acts, acts, acts--concrete, substantial,\nmaterial acts. The greatest and happiest day of her life had been when\nat last she laid her bare hand upon the rough, hard stone of the house\nin the square and looked up at the facade, her dull-blue eyes flashing\nwith the light that so rarely came to them, while she murmured between\nher teeth:\n\n\"I--did--this.\"\n\nAs she recalled this moment now, leaning upon her elbows, looking down\nupon the trees and grass and asphalt of the square, and upon a receding\nlandau, a wave of a certain natural pride in her strength, the\nsatisfaction of attainment, came to her. Ah! she was better than other\nwomen; ah! she was stronger than other women; she was carrying out a\nsplendid work. She straightened herself to her full height abruptly,\nstretching her outspread hands vaguely to the sunlight, to the City, to\nthe world, to the great engine of life whose lever she could grasp and\ncould control, smiling proudly, almost insolently, in the consciousness\nof her strength, the fine steadfastness of her purpose. Then all at once\nthe smile was struck from her lips, the stiffness of her poise suddenly\nrelaxed. There, there it was again, the terror, the dreadful fear she\ndared not name, back in its place once more--at her side, at her\nshoulder, at her throat, ready to clutch at her from out the dark.\n\nShe wheeled from the window, from the sunlight, her hands clasped before\nher trembling lips, the tears brimming her dull-blue eyes. For\nforty-eight hours she had fought this from her. But now it was no longer\nto be resisted.\n\n\"No, no,\" she cried half aloud. \"I am no better, no stronger than the\nothers. What does it all amount to when I know that, after all, I am\njust a woman--just a woman whose heart is slowly breaking?\"\n\nBut there was an interruption. Rownie had knocked twice at her door\nbefore Lloyd had heard her. When Lloyd had opened the door the girl\nhanded her a card with an address written on it in the superintendent's\nhand.\n\n\"This here jus' now come in f'om Dr. Street, Miss Lloyd,\" said Rownie;\n\"Miss Bergyn\" (this was the superintendent nurse) \"ast me to give it to\nyou.\"\n\nIt was a call to an address that seemed familiar to Lloyd at first; but\nshe did not stop at that moment to reflect. Her stable telephone hung\nagainst the wall of the closet. She rang for Lewis, and while waiting\nfor him to get around dressed for the street.\n\nFor the moment, at the prospect of action, even her haunting fear drew\noff and stood away from her. She was absorbed in her work upon the\ninstant--alert, watchful, self-reliant. What the case was she could only\nsurmise. How long she would be away she had no means of knowing--a week,\na month, a year, she could not tell. But she was ready for any\ncontingency. Usually the doctors informed the nurses as to the nature of\nthe case at the time of sending for them, but Dr. Street had not done so\nnow.\n\nHowever, Rownie called up to her that her coup\u00c3\u00a9 was at the door. Lloyd\ncaught up her satchels and ran down the stairs, crying good-bye to Miss\nDouglass, whom she saw at the farther end of the hall. In the hallway by\nthe vestibule she changed the slide bearing her name from the top to the\nbottom of the roster.\n\n\"How about your mail?\" cried Miss Douglass after her.\n\n\"Keep it here for me until I see how long I'm to be away,\" answered\nLloyd, her hand upon the knob. \"I'll let you know.\"\n\nLewis had put Rox in the shafts, and while the coup\u00c3\u00a9 spun over the\nasphalt at a smart clip Lloyd tried to remember where she had heard of\nthe address before. Suddenly she snapped her fingers; she knew the case,\nhad even been assigned to it some eight months before.\n\n\"Yes, yes, that's it--Campbell--wife dead--Lafayette Avenue--little\ndaughter, Hattie--hip disease--hopeless--poor little baby.\"\n\nArriving at the house, Lloyd found the surgeon, Dr. Street, and Mr.\nCampbell, who was a widower, waiting for her in a small drawing-room off\nthe library. The surgeon was genuinely surprised and delighted to see\nher. Most of the doctors of the City knew Lloyd for the best trained\nnurse in the hospitals.\n\n\"Oh, it's you, Miss Searight; good enough!\" The surgeon introduced her\nto the little patient's father, adding: \"If any one can pull us through,\nCampbell, it will be Miss Searight.\"\n\nThe surgeon and nurse began to discuss the case.\n\n\"I think you know it already, don't you, Miss Searight?\" said the\nsurgeon. \"You took care of it a while last winter. Well, there was a\nlittle improvement in the spring, not so much pain, but that in itself\nis a bad sign. We have done what we could, Farnham and I. But it don't\nyield to treatment; you know how these things are--stubborn. We made a\npreliminary examination yesterday. Sinuses have occurred, and the probe\nleads down to nothing but dead bone. Farnham and I had a consultation\nthis morning. We must play our last card. I shall exsect the joint\nto-morrow.\"\n\nMr. Campbell drew in his breath and held it for a moment, looking out of\nthe window.\n\nVery attentive, Lloyd merely nodded her head, murmuring:\n\n\"I understand.\"\n\nWhen Dr. Street had gone Lloyd immediately set to work. The operation\nwas to take place at noon the following day, and she foresaw there would\nbe no sleep for her that night. Street had left everything to her, even\nto the sterilising of his instruments. Until daylight the following\nmorning Lloyd came and went about the house with an untiring energy, yet\nwith the silence of a swiftly moving shadow, getting together the things\nneeded for the operation--strychnia tablets, absorbent cotton, the\nrubber tubing for the tourniquet, bandages, salt, and the like--and\npreparing the little chamber adjoining the sick-room as an\noperating-room.\n\nThe little patient herself, Hattie, hardly into her teens, remembered\nLloyd at once. Before she went to sleep Lloyd contrived to spend an hour\nin the sick-room with her, told her as much as was necessary of what\nwas contemplated, and, by her cheery talk, her gentleness and sympathy,\ninspired the little girl with a certain sense of confidence and trust in\nher.\n\n\"But--but--but just how bad will it hurt, Miss Searight?\" inquired\nHattie, looking at her, wide-eyed and serious.\n\n\"Dear, it won't hurt you at all; just two or three breaths of the ether\nand you will be sound asleep. When you wake up it will be all over and\nyou will be well.\"\n\nLloyd made the ether cone from a stiff towel, and set it on Hattie's\ndressing-table. Last of all and just before the operation the gauze\nsponges occupied her attention. The daytime brought her no rest. Hattie\nwas not to have any breakfast, but toward the middle of the forenoon\nLloyd gave her a stimulating enema of whiskey and water, following it\nabout an hour later by a hundredth grain of atropia. She braided the\nlittle girl's hair in two long plaits so that her head would rest\nsquarely and flatly upon the pillow. Hattie herself was now ready for\nthe surgeon.\n\nNow there was nothing more to be done. Lloyd could but wait. She took\nher place at the bedside and tried to talk as lightly as was possible to\nher patient. But now there was a pause in the round of action. Her mind\nno longer keenly intent upon the immediate necessities of the moment,\nbegan to hark back again to the one great haunting fear that for so long\nhad overshadowed it. Even while she exerted herself to be cheerful and\nwatched for the smiles on Hattie's face her hands twisted tight and\ntighter under the folds of her blouse, and some second self within her\nseemed to say:\n\n\"Suppose, suppose it should come, this thing I dread but dare not name,\nwhat then, what then? Should I not expect it? Is it not almost a\ncertainty? Have I not been merely deceiving myself with the forlornest\nhopes? Is it not the most reasonable course to expect the worst? Do not\nall indications point that way? Has not my whole life been shaped to\nthis end? Was not this calamity, this mighty sorrow, prepared for me\neven before I was born? And one can do nothing, absolutely nothing,\nnothing, but wait and hope and fear, and eat out one's heart with\nlonging.\"\n\nThere was a knock at the door. Instead of calling to enter Lloyd went to\nit softly and opened it a few inches. Mr. Campbell was there.\n\n\"They've come--Street and the assistant.\"\n\nLloyd heard a murmur of voices in the hall below and the closing of the\nfront door.\n\nFarnham and Street went at once to the operating-room to make their\nhands and wrists aseptic. Campbell had gone downstairs to his\nsmoking-room. It had been decided--though contrary to custom--that Lloyd\nshould administer the chloroform.\n\nAt length Street tapped with the handle of a scalpel on the door to say\nthat he was ready.\n\n\"Now, dear,\" said Lloyd, turning to Hattie, and picking up the ether\ncone.\n\nBut the little girl's courage suddenly failed her. She began to plead in\na low voice choked with tears. Her supplications were pitiful; but\nLloyd, once more intent upon her work, every faculty and thought\nconcentrated upon what must be done, did not temporise an instant.\nQuietly she gathered Hattie's frail wrists in the grip of one strong\npalm, and held the cone to her face until she had passed off with a long\nsigh. She picked her up lightly, carried her into the next room, and\nlaid her upon the operating-table. At the last moment Lloyd had busied\nherself with the preparation of her own person. Over her dress she\npassed her hospital blouse, which had been under a dry heat for hours.\nShe rolled her sleeves up from her strong white forearms with their\nthick wrists and fine blue veining, and for upward of ten minutes\nscrubbed them with a new nail-brush in water as hot as she could bear\nit. After this she let her hands and forearms lie in the permanganate of\npotash solution till they were brown to the elbow, then washed away the\nstain in the oxalic-acid solution and in sterilised hot water. Street\nand Farnham, wearing their sterilised gowns and gloves, took their\nplaces. There was no conversation. The only sounds were an occasional\nsigh from the patient, a direction given in a low tone, and, at\nintervals, the click of the knives and scalpel. From outside the window\ncame the persistent chirping of a band of sparrows.\n\nPromptly the operation was begun; there was no delay, no hesitation;\nwhat there was to be done had been carefully planned beforehand, even to\nthe minutest details. Street, a master of his profession, thoroughly\nfamiliar with every difficulty that might present itself during the\ncourse of the work in hand, foreseeing every contingency, prepared for\nevery emergency, calm, watchful, self-contained, set about the exsecting\nof the joint with no trace of compunction, no embarrassment, no\nmisgiving. His assistants, as well as he himself, knew that life or\ndeath hung upon the issue of the next ten minutes. Upon Street alone\ndevolved the life of the little girl. A second's hesitation at the wrong\nstage of the operation, a slip of bistoury or scalpel, a tremor of the\nwrist, a single instant's clumsiness of the fingers, and the\nEnemy--watching for every chance, intent for every momentarily opened\nchink or cranny wherein he could thrust his lean fingers--entered the\nfrail tenement with a leap, a rushing, headlong spring that jarred the\nhouse of life to its foundations. Lowering close over her head Lloyd\nfelt the shadow of his approach. He had arrived there in that\ncommonplace little room, with its commonplace accessories, its\nornaments, that suddenly seemed so trivial, so impertinent--the stopped\nFrench clock, with its simpering, gilded cupids, on the mantelpiece; the\nphotograph of a number of picnickers \"grouped\" on a hotel piazza gazing\nwith monolithic cheerfulness at this grim business, this struggle of the\ntwo world forces, this crisis in a life.\n\nThen abruptly the operation was over.\n\nThe nurse and surgeons eased their positions immediately, drawing long\nbreaths. They began to talk, commenting upon the operation, and Lloyd,\nintensely interested, asked Street why he had, contrary to her\nexpectations, removed the bone above the lesser trochanter. He smiled,\ndelighted at her intelligence.\n\n\"It's better than cutting through the neck, Miss Searight,\" he told her.\n\"If I had gone through the neck, don't you see, the trochanter major\nwould come over the hole and prevent the discharges.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, I see, of course,\" assented Lloyd.\n\nThe incision was sewn up, and when all was over Lloyd carried Hattie\nback to the bed in the next room. Slowly the little girl regained\nconsciousness, and Lloyd began to regard her once more as a human being.\nDuring the operation she had forgotten the very existence of Hattie\nCampbell, a little girl she knew. She had only seen a bit of mechanism\nout of order and in the hands of a repairer. It was always so with\nLloyd. Her charges were not infrequently persons whom she knew, often\nintimately, but during the time of their sickness their personalities\nvanished for the trained nurse; she saw only the \"case,\" only the\nmechanism, only the deranged clockwork in imminent danger of running\ndown.\n\nBut the danger was by no means over. The operation had been near the\ntrunk. There had been considerable loss of blood, and the child's power\nof resistance had been weakened by long periods of suffering. Lloyd\nfeared that the shock might prove too great. Farnham departed, but for a\nlittle while the surgeon remained with Lloyd to watch the symptoms. At\nlength, however, he too, pressed for time, and expected at one of the\nlarger hospitals of the City, went away, leaving directions for Lloyd to\ntelephone him in case of the slightest change. At this hour, late in the\nafternoon, there were no indications that the little girl would not\nrecover from the shock. Street believed she would rally and ultimately\nregain her health.\n\n\"But,\" he told Lloyd as he bade her good-bye, \"I don't need to impress\nupon you the need of care and the greatest vigilance; absolute rest is\nthe only thing; she must see nobody, not even her father. The whole\nsystem is numbed and deadened just yet, but there will be a change\neither for better or worse some time to-night.\"\n\nFor thirty-six hours Lloyd had not closed an eye, but of that she had no\nthought. Her supper was sent up to her, and she prepared herself for her\nnight's watch. She gave the child such nourishment as she believed she\ncould stand, and from time to time took her pulse, making records of it\nupon her chart for the surgeon's inspection later on. At intervals she\ntook Hattie's temperature, placing the clinical thermometer in the\narmpit. Toward nine in the evening, while she was doing this for the\nthird time within the hour, one of the house servants came to the room\nto inform her that she was wanted on the telephone. Lloyd hesitated,\nunwilling to leave Hattie for an instant. However, the telephone was\nclose at hand, and it was quite possible that Dr. Street had rung her up\nto ask for news.\n\nBut it was the agency that had called, and Miss Douglass informed her\nthat a telegram had arrived there for her a few moments before. Should\nshe hold it or send it to her by Rownie? Lloyd reflected a moment.\n\n\"Oh--open it and read it to me,\" she said. \"It's a call, isn't\nit?--or--no; send it here by Rownie, and send my hospital slippers with\nher, the ones without heels. But don't ring up again to-night; we're\nexpecting a crisis almost any moment.\"\n\nLloyd returned to the sick-room, sent away the servant, and once more\nsettled herself for the night. Hattie had roused for a moment.\n\n\"Am I going to get well, am I going to get well, Miss Searight?\"\n\nLloyd put her finger to her lips, nodding her head, and Hattie closed\nher eyes again with a long breath. A certain great tenderness and\ncompassion for the little girl grew big in Lloyd's heart. To herself she\nsaid:\n\n\"God helping me, you shall get well. They believe in me, these\npeople--'If any one could pull us through it would be Miss Searight.' We\nwill 'pull through,' yes, for I'll do it.\"\n\nThe night closed down, dark and still and very hot. Lloyd, regulating\nthe sick-room's ventilation, opened one of the windows from the top. The\nnoises of the City steadily decreasing as the hours passed, reached her\nears in a subdued, droning murmur. On her bed, that had for so long been\nher bed of pain, Hattie lay with closed eyes, inert, motionless, hardly\nseeming to breathe, her life in the balance; unhappy little invalid,\nwasted with suffering, with drawn, pinched face and bloodless lips, and\nat her side Lloyd, her dull-blue eyes never leaving her patient's face,\nalert and vigilant, despite her long wakefulness, her great bronze-red\nflame of hair rolling from her forehead and temples, the sombre glow in\nher cheeks no whit diminished by her day of fatigue, of responsibility\nand untiring activity.\n\nFor the time being she could thrust her fear, the relentless Enemy that\nfor so long had hung upon her heels, back and away from her. There was\nanother Enemy now to fight--or was it another--was it not the same\nEnemy, the very same, whose shadow loomed across that sick-bed, across\nthe frail, small body and pale, drawn face?\n\nWith her pity and compassion for the sick child there arose in Lloyd a\ncertain unreasoned, intuitive obstinacy, a banding together of all her\npowers and faculties in one great effort at resistance, a steadfastness\nunder great stress, a stubbornness, that shut its ears and eyes. It was\nher one dominant characteristic rising up, strong and insistent the\ninstant she knew herself to be thwarted in her desires or checked in a\ncourse she believed to be right and good. And now as she felt the\nadvance of the Enemy and saw the shadow growing darker across the bed\nher obstinacy hardened like tempered steel.\n\n\"No,\" she murmured, her brows levelled, her lips compressed, \"she shall\nnot die. I will not let her go.\"\n\nA little later, perhaps an hour after midnight, at a time when she\nbelieved Hattie to be asleep, Lloyd, watchful as ever, noted that her\ncheeks began alternately to puff out and contract with her breathing. In\nan instant the nurse was on her feet. She knew the meaning of this sign.\nHattie had fainted while asleep. Lloyd took the temperature. It was\nfalling rapidly. The pulse was weak, rapid, and irregular. It seemed\nimpossible for Hattie to take a deep breath.\n\nThen swiftly the expected crisis began to develop itself. Lloyd ordered\nStreet to be sent for, but only as a matter of form. Long before he\ncould arrive the issue would be decided. She knew that now Hattie's life\ndepended on herself alone.\n\n\"Now,\" she murmured, as though the Enemy she fought could hear her, \"now\nlet us see who is the stronger. You or I.\"\n\nSwiftly and gently she drew the bed from the wall and raised its foot,\npropping it in position with half a dozen books. Then, while waiting for\nthe servants, whom she had despatched for hot blankets, administered a\nhypodermic injection of brandy.\n\n\"We will pull you through,\" she kept saying to herself, \"we will pull\nyou through. I shall not let you go.\"\n\nThe Enemy was close now, and the fight was hand to hand. Lloyd could\nalmost feel, physically, actually, feel the slow, sullen, resistless\npull that little by little was dragging Hattie's life from her grip. She\nset her teeth, holding back with all her might, bracing herself against\nthe strain, refusing with all inborn stubbornness to yield her position.\n\n\"No--no,\" she repeated to herself, \"you shall not have her. I will not\ngive her up; you shall not triumph over me.\"\n\nCampbell was in the room, warned by the ominous coming and going of\nhushed footsteps.\n\n\"What is the use, nurse? It's all over. Let her die in peace. It's too\ncruel; let her die in peace.\"\n\nThe half-hour passed, then the hour. Once more Lloyd administered\nhypodermically the second dose of brandy. Campbell, unable to bear the\nsight, had withdrawn to the adjoining room, where he could be heard\npacing the floor. From time to time he came back for a moment,\nwhispering:\n\n\"Will she live, nurse? Will she live? Shall we pull her through?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" Lloyd told him. \"I don't know. Wait. Go back. I will let\nyou know.\"\n\nAnother fifteen minutes passed. Lloyd fancied that the heart's action\nwas growing a little stronger. A great stillness had settled over the\nhouse. The two servants waiting Lloyd's orders in the hall outside the\ndoor refrained even from whispering. From the next room came the muffled\nsound of pacing footsteps, hurried, irregular, while with that strange\nperversity which seizes upon the senses at moments when they are more\nthan usually acute Lloyd began to be aware of a vague, unwonted movement\nin the City itself, outside there behind the drawn curtains and\nhalf-opened window--a faint, uncertain agitation, a trouble, a passing\nripple on the still black pool of the night, coming and going, and\ncoming again, each time a little more insistent, each time claiming a\nlittle more attention and notice. It was about half past three o'clock.\nBut the little patient's temperature was rising--there could be no doubt\nabout that. The lungs expanded wider and deeper. Hattie's breathing was\nunmistakably easier; and as Lloyd put her fingers to the wrist she could\nhardly keep back a little exultant cry as she felt the pulse throbbing\nfuller, a little slower, a little more regularly. Now she redoubled her\nattention. Her hold upon the little life shut tighter; her power of\nresistance, her strength of purpose, seemed to be suddenly quadrupled.\nShe could imagine the Enemy drawing off; she could think that the grip\nof cold fingers was loosening.\n\nSlowly the crisis passed off, slowly the reaction began. Hattie was\nstill unconscious, but there was a new look upon her face--a look that\nLloyd had learned to know from long experience, an intangible and most\nillusive expression, nothing, something, the sign that only those who\nare trained to search for it may see and appreciate--the earliest faint\nflicker after the passing of the shadow.\n\n\"Will she live, will she live, nurse?\" came Mr. Campbell's whisper at\nher shoulder.\n\n\"I think--I am almost sure--but we must not be too certain yet. Still\nthere's a chance; yes, there's a chance.\"\n\nCampbell, suddenly gone white, put out his hand and leaned a moment\nagainst the mantelpiece. He did not now leave the room. The door-bell\nrang.\n\n\"Dr. Street,\" murmured Lloyd.\n\nBut what had happened in the City? There in the still dark hours of that\nhot summer night an event of national, perhaps even international,\nimportance had surely transpired. It was in the air--a sense of a Great\nThing come suddenly to a head somewhere in the world. Footsteps sounded\nrapidly on the echoing sidewalks. Here and there a street door opened.\nFrom corner to corner, growing swiftly nearer, came the cry of newsboys\nchanting extras. A subdued excitement was abroad, finding expression in\na vague murmur, the mingling of many sounds into one huge note--a note\nthat gradually swelled and grew louder and seemed to be rising from all\ncorners of the City at once.\n\nThere was a step at the sick-room door. Dr. Street? No, Rownie--Rownie\nwith two telegrams for Lloyd.\n\nLloyd took them from her, then with a sharp, brusque movement of her\nhead and suddenly smitten with an idea, turned from them to listen to\nthe low, swelling murmur of the City. These despatches--no, they were no\n\"call\" for her. She guessed what they might be. Why had they come to her\nnow? Why was there this sense of some great tidings in the wind? The\nsame tidings that had come to the world might come to her--in these\ndespatches. Might it not be so? She caught her breath quickly. The\nterror, the fearful anxiety that had haunted and oppressed her for so\nlong, was it to be lifted now at last? The Enemy that lurked in the dark\ncorners, ever ready to clutch her, was it to be driven back and away\nfrom her forever? She dared not hope for it. But something was coming to\nher; she knew it, she felt it; something was preparing for her, coming\nto her swifter with every second--coming, coming, coming from out the\nnorth. She saw Dr. Street in the room, though how and when he had\narrived she could not afterward recall. Her mind was all alert, intent\nupon other things, listening, waiting. The surgeon had been leaning over\nthe bed. Suddenly he straightened up, saying aloud to Campbell:\n\n\"Good, good, we're safe. We have pulled through.\"\n\nLloyd tore open her telegrams. One was signed \"Bennett,\" the other\n\"Ferriss.\"\n\n\"Thank God!\" exclaimed Mr. Campbell.\n\n\"Oh,\" cried Lloyd, a great sob shaking her from head to heel, a smile of\ninfinite happiness flashing from her face. \"Oh--yes, thank God, we--we\n_have_ pulled through.\"\n\n\"Am I going to get well, am I going to get well, Miss Searight?\" Hattie,\nonce more conscious, raised her voice weak and faint.\n\nLloyd was on her knees beside her, her head bent over her.\n\n\"Hush; yes, dear, you are safe.\" Then the royal bronze-red hair bent\nlower still. The dull-blue eyes were streaming now, the voice one low\nquiver of sobs. Tenderly, gently Lloyd put an arm about the child, her\nhead bending lower and lower. Her cheek touched Hattie's. For a moment\nthe little girl, frail, worn, pitifully wasted, and the strong, vigorous\nwoman, with her imperious will and indomitable purpose, rested their\nheads upon the same pillow, both broken with suffering, the one of the\nbody, the other of the mind.\n\n\"Safe; yes, dear, safe,\" whispered Lloyd, her face all but hidden.\n\"Safe, safe, and saved to me. Oh, dearest of all the world!\"\n\nAnd then to her ears the murmur of the City seemed to leap suddenly to\narticulate words, the clanging thunder of the entire nation--the whole\nround world thrilling with this great news that had come to it from out\nthe north in the small hours of this hot summer's night. And the\nchanting cries of the street rolled to her like the tremendous diapason\nof a gigantic organ:\n\n\"Rescued, rescued, rescued!\"\n\n\n\n\nIV.\n\n\nOn the day that Lloyd returned to the house on Calumet Square (Hattie's\nrecovery being long since assured), and while she was unpacking her\nvalise and settling herself again in her room, a messenger boy brought\nher a note.\n\n\"Have just arrived in the City. When may I see you? BENNETT.\"\n\nNews of Ward Bennett and of Richard Ferriss had not been wanting during\nthe past fortnight or so. Their names and that of the ship herself, even\nthe names of Adler, Hansen, Clarke, and Dennison, even Muck Tu, even\nthat of Kamiska, the one surviving dog, filled the mouths and minds of\nmen to the exclusion of everything else.\n\nThe return of the expedition after its long imprisonment in the ice and\nat a time when all hope of its safety had been abandoned was one of the\ngreat events of that year. The fact that the expedition had failed to\nreach the Pole, or to attain any unusual high latitude, was forgotten or\nignored. Nothing was remembered but the masterly retreat toward\nKolyuchin Bay, the wonderful march over the ice, the indomitable\ncourage, unshaken by hardship, perils, obstacles, and privations almost\nbeyond imagination. All this, together with a multitude of details, some\nof them palpably fictitious, the press of the City where Bennett and\nFerriss both had their homes published and republished and published\nagain and again. News of the men, their whereabouts and intentions,\ninvaded the sick-room--where Lloyd watched over the convalescence of her\nlittle patient--by the very chinks of the windows.\n\nLloyd learned how the ship had been \"nipped;\" how, after inconceivable\ntoil, the members of the expedition had gained the land; how they had\nmarched southward toward the Chuckch settlements; how, at the eleventh\nhour, the survivors, exhausted and starving, had been rescued by the\nsteam whalers; how these whalers themselves had been caught in the ice,\nand how the survivors of the Freja had been obliged to spend another\nwinter in the Arctic. She learned the details of their final return. In\nthe quiet, darkened room where Hattie lay she heard from without the\necho of the thunder of the nations; she saw how the figure of Bennett\ntowered suddenly magnificent in the world; how that the people were\nbrusquely made aware of a new hero. She learned that honours came\nthronging about him unsought; that the King of the Belgians had\nconferred a decoration upon him; that the geographical societies of\ncontinental Europe had elected him to honourary membership; that the\nPresident and the Secretary of War had sent telegrams of\ncongratulations.\n\n\"And what does he do,\" she murmured, \"the first of all upon his return?\nAsks to see me--me!\"\n\nShe sent an answer to his note by the same boy who brought it, naming\nthe following afternoon, explaining that two days later she expected to\ngo into the country to a little town called Bannister to take her annual\nfortnight's vacation.\n\n\"But what of--of the other?\" she murmured as she stood at the window of\nher room watching the messenger boy bicycling across the square. \"Why\ndoes not he--he, too--?\"\n\nShe put her chin in the air and turned about, looking abstractedly at\nthe rugs on the parquetry.\n\nLloyd's vacation had really begun two days before. Her name was off the\nroster of the house, and till the end of the month her time was her own.\nThe afternoon was hot and very still. Even in the cool, stone-built\nagency, with its windows wide and heavily shaded with awnings, the heat\nwas oppressive. For a long time Lloyd had been shut away from fresh air\nand the sun, and now she suddenly decided to drive out in the City's\npark. She rang up her stable and ordered Lewis to put her ponies to her\nphaeton.\n\nShe spent a delightful two hours in the great park, losing herself in\nits farthest, shadiest, and most unfrequented corners. She drove\nherself, and intelligently. Horses were her passion, and not Lewis\nhimself understood their care and management better. Toward the cool of\nthe day and just as she had pulled the ponies down to a walk in a long,\ndeserted avenue overspanned with elms and great cottonwoods she was all\nat once aware of an open carriage that had turned into the far end of\nthe same avenue approaching at an easy trot. It drew near, and she saw\nthat its only occupant was a man leaning back rather limply in the\ncushions. As the eye of the trained nurse fell upon him she at once\nplaced him in the category of convalescents or chronic invalids, and she\nwas vaguely speculating as to the nature of his complaint when the\ncarriage drew opposite her phaeton, and she recognised Richard Ferriss.\n\nFerriss, but not the same Ferriss to whom she had said good-bye on that\nnever-to-be-forgotten March afternoon, with its gusts and rain, four\nlong years ago. The Ferriss she had known then had been an alert, keen\nman, with quick, bright eyes, alive to every impression, responsive to\nevery sensation, living his full allowance of life. She was looking now\nat a man unnaturally old, of deadened nerves, listless. As he caught\nsight of her and recognised her he suddenly roused himself with a quick,\nglad smile and with a look in his eyes that to Lloyd was unmistakable.\nBut there was not that joyful, exuberant start she had anticipated, and,\nfor that matter, wished. Neither did Lloyd set any too great store by\nthe small amenities of life, but that Ferriss should remain covered hurt\nher a little. She wondered how she could note so trivial a detail at\nsuch a moment. But this was Ferriss.\n\nHer heart was beating fast and thick as she halted her ponies. The\ndriver of the carriage jumped down and held the door for Ferriss, and\nthe chief engineer stepped quickly toward her.\n\nSo it was they met after four years--and such years--unexpectedly,\nwithout warning or preparation, and not at all as she had expected. What\nthey said to each other in those first few moments Lloyd could never\nafterward clearly remember. One incident alone detached itself vividly\nfrom the blur.\n\n\"I have just come from the square,\" Ferriss had explained, \"and they\ntold me that you had left for a drive out here only the moment before,\nso there was nothing for it but to come after you.\"\n\n\"Shan't we walk a little?\" she remembered she had asked after a while.\n\"We can have the carriages wait; or do you feel strong enough? I\nforgot--\"\n\nBut he interrupted her, protesting his fitness.\n\n\"The doctor merely sent me out to get the air, and it's humiliating to\nbe wheeled about like an old woman.\"\n\nLloyd passed the reins back of her to Lewis, and, gathering her skirts\nabout her, started to descend from the phaeton. The step was rather high\nfrom the ground. Ferriss stood close by. Why did he not help her? Why\ndid he stand there, his hands in his pockets, so listless and\nunconscious of her difficulty. A little glow of irritation deepened the\ndull crimson of her cheeks. Even returned Arctic explorers could not\nafford to ignore entirely life's little courtesies--and he of all men.\n\n\"Well,\" she said, expectantly hesitating before attempting to descend.\n\nThen she caught Ferriss's eyes fixed upon her. He was smiling a little,\nbut the dull, stupefied expression of his face seemed for a brief\ninstant to give place to one of great sadness. He raised a shoulder\nresignedly, and Lloyd, with the suddenness of a blow, remembered that\nFerriss had no hands.\n\nShe dropped back in the seat of the phaeton, covering her eyes, shaken\nand unnerved for the moment with a great thrill of infinite pity--of\nshame at her own awkwardness, and of horror as for one brief instant the\nsmiling summer park, the afternoon's warmth, the avenue of green,\nover-arching trees, the trim, lacquered vehicles and glossy-brown horses\nwere struck from her mind, and she had a swift vision of the Ice, the\ndarkness of the winter night, the lacerating, merciless cold, the\nblinding, whirling, dust-like snow.\n\nFor half an hour they walked slowly about in the park, the carriages\nfollowing at a distance. They did not talk very much. It seemed to Lloyd\nthat she would never tire of scrutinising his face, that her interest in\nhis point of view, his opinions, would never flag. He had had an\nexperience that came but to few men. For four years he had been out of\nthe world, had undergone privation beyond conception. What now was to be\nhis attitude? How had he changed? That he had not changed to her Lloyd\nknew in an instant. He still loved her; that was beyond all doubt. But\nthis terrible apathy that seemed now to be a part of him! She had heard\nof the numbing stupor that invades those who stay beyond their time in\nthe Ice, but never before had she seen it in its reality. It was not a\nlack of intelligence; it seemed rather to be the machinery of\nintelligence rusted and clogged from long disuse. He deliberated long\nbefore he spoke. It took him some time to understand things. Speech did\nnot come to him readily, and he became easily confused in the matter of\nwords. Once, suddenly, he had interrupted her, breaking out with:\n\n\"Oh, the smell of the trees, of the grass! Isn't it wonderful; isn't it\nwonderful?\" And a few seconds later, quite irrelevantly: \"And, after\nall, we failed.\"\n\nAt once Lloyd was all aroused, defending him against himself.\n\n\"Failed! And you say that? If you did not reach the Pole, what then? The\nworld will judge you by results perhaps, and the world's judgment will\nbe wrong. Is it nothing that you have given the world an example of\nheroism--\"\n\n\"Oh, don't call it that.\"\n\n\"Of heroism, of courage, of endurance? Is it nothing that you have\novercome obstacles before which other men would have died? Is it nothing\nthat you have shown us all how to be patient, how to be strong? There\nare some things better even than reaching the Pole. To suffer and be\ncalm is one of them; not to give up--never to be beaten--is another. Oh,\nif I were a man! Ten thousand, a hundred thousand people are reading\nto-night of what you have done--of what you have done, you understand,\nnot of what you have failed to do. They have seen--you have shown them\nwhat the man can do who says _I will_, and you have done a little more,\nhave gone a little further, have been a little braver, a little hardier,\na little nobler, a little more determined than any one has ever been\nbefore. Whoever fails now cannot excuse himself by saying that he has\ndone as much as a man can do. He will have to remember the men of the\nFreja. He will have to remember you. Don't you suppose I am proud of\nyou; don't you suppose that I am stronger and better because of what you\nhave done? Do you think it is nothing for me to be sitting here beside\nyou, here in this park--to be--yes, to be with you? Can't you\nunderstand? Isn't it something to me that you are the man you are; not\nthe man whose name the people are shouting just now, not the man to whom\na king gave a bit of ribbon and enamel, but the man who lived like a\nman, who would not die just because it was easier to die than to live,\nwho fought like a man, not only for himself but for the lives of those\nhe led, who showed us all how to be strong, and how strong one could be\nif one would only try? What does the Pole amount to? The world wants\nmen, great, strong, harsh, brutal men--men with purposes, who let\nnothing, nothing, nothing stand in their way.\"\n\n\"You mean Bennett,\" said Ferriss, looking up quickly. \"You commenced by\nspeaking of me, but it's Bennett you are talking of now.\"\n\nBut he caught her glance and saw that she was looking steadfastly at\nhim--at him. A look was in her face, a light in her dull-blue eyes, that\nhe had never seen there before.\n\n\"Lloyd,\" he said quietly, \"which one of us, Bennett or I, were you\nspeaking of just then? You know what I mean; which one of us?\"\n\n\"I was speaking of the man who was strong enough to do great things,\"\nshe said.\n\nFerriss drew the stumps of his arms from his pockets and smiled at them\ngrimly.\n\n\"H'm, can one do much--this way?\" he muttered.\n\nWith a movement she did not try to restrain Lloyd put both her hands\nover his poor, shapeless wrists. Never in her life had she been so\nstrongly moved. Pity, such as she had never known, a tenderness and\ncompassion such as she had never experienced, went knocking at her\nbreast. She had no words at hand for so great emotions. She longed to\ntell him what was in her heart, but all speech failed.\n\n\"Don't!\" she exclaimed. \"Don't! I will not have you.\"\n\nA little later, as they were returning toward the carriages, Lloyd,\nafter a moment's deliberation upon the matter, said:\n\n\"Can't I set you down somewhere near your rooms? Let your carriage go.\"\n\nHe shook his head: \"I've just given up my downtown rooms. Bennett and I\nhave taken other rooms much farther uptown. In fact, I believe I am\nsupposed to be going there now. It would be quite out of your way to\ntake me there. We are much quieter out there, and people can't get at us\nso readily. The doctor says we both need rest after our shaking up.\nBennett himself--iron as he is--is none too strong, and what with the\nmail, the telegrams, reporters, deputations, editors, and visitors, and\nthe like, we are kept on something of a strain. Besides we have still a\ngood deal of work to do getting our notes into shape.\"\n\nLewis brought the ponies to the edge of the walk, and Lloyd and Ferriss\nseparated, she turning the ponies' heads homeward, starting away at a\nbrisk trot, and leaving him in his carriage, which he had directed to\ncarry him to his new quarters.\n\nBut at the turn of the avenue Lloyd leaned from the phaeton and looked\nback. The carriage was just disappearing down the vista of elms and\ncottonwoods. She waved her hand gayly, and Ferriss responded with the\nstump of one forearm.\n\nOn the next day but one, a Friday, Lloyd was to go to the country. Every\nyear in the heat of the summer Lloyd spent her short vacation in the\nsleepy and old-fashioned little village of Bannister. The country around\nthe village was part of the Searight estate. It was quiet, off the\nrailroad, just the place to forget duties, responsibilities, and the\nwearing anxieties of sick-rooms. But Thursday afternoon she expected\nBennett.\n\nThursday morning she was in her room. Her trunk was already packed.\nThere was nothing more to be done. She was off duty. There was neither\ncare nor responsibility upon her mind. But she was too joyful, too\nhappily exalted, too exuberant in gayety to pass her time in reading.\nShe wanted action, movement, life, and instinctively threw open a window\nof her room, and, according to her habit, leaned upon her elbows and\nlooked out and down upon the square. The morning was charming. Later in\nthe day it probably would be very hot, but as yet the breeze of the\nearliest hours was stirring nimbly. The cool of it put a brisker note in\nthe sombre glow of her cheeks, and just stirred a lock that, escaping\nfrom her gorgeous coils of dark-red hair, hung curling over her ear and\nneck. Into her eyes of dull blue--like the blue of old china--the\nmorning's sun sent an occasional unwonted sparkle. Over the asphalt and\nover the green grass-plots of the square the shadows of the venerable\nelms wove a shifting maze of tracery. Traffic avoided the place. It was\ninvariably quiet in the square, and one--as now--could always hear the\nsubdued ripple and murmur of the fountain in the centre.\n\nBut the crowning delight of that morning was the sudden appearance of a\nrobin in a tree close to Lloyd's window. He was searching his breakfast.\nAt every moment he came and went between the tree-tops and the\ngrass-plots, very important, very preoccupied, chittering and calling\nthe while, as though he would never tire. Lloyd whistled to him, and\ninstantly he answered, cocking his head sideways. She whistled again,\nand he piped back an impudent response, and for quite five minutes the\ntwo held an elaborate altercation between tree-top and window-ledge.\nLloyd caught herself laughing outright and aloud for no assignable\nreason. \"Ah, the world was a pretty good place after all!\"\n\nA little later, and while she was still at the window, Rownie brought\nher a note from Bennett, sent by special messenger.\n\n\"Ferriss woke up sick this morning. Nobody here but the two of us;\ncan't leave him alone. BENNETT.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" exclaimed Lloyd Searight a little blankly.\n\nThe robin and his effrontery at once ceased to be amusing. She closed\nthe window abruptly, shutting out the summer morning's gayety and charm,\nturning her back upon the sunlight.\n\nNow she was more in the humour of reading. On the great divan against\nthe wall lay the month's magazines and two illustrated weeklies. Lloyd\nhad bought them to read on the train. But now she settled herself upon\nthe divan and, picking up one of the weeklies, turned its leaves\nlistlessly. All at once she came upon two pictures admirably reproduced\nfrom photographs, and serving as illustrations to the weekly's main\narticle--\"The Two Leaders of the Freja Expedition.\" One was a picture of\nBennett, the other of Ferriss.\n\nThe suddenness with which she had come upon his likeness almost took\nLloyd's breath from her. It was the last thing she had expected. If he\nhimself had abruptly entered the room in person she could hardly have\nbeen more surprised. Her heart gave a great leap, the dull crimson of\nher cheeks shot to her forehead. Then, with a charming movement, at once\nimpulsive and shamefaced, smiling the while, her eyes half-closing, she\nlaid her cheek upon the picture, murmuring to herself words that only\nherself should hear. The next day she left for the country.\n\nOn that same day when Dr. Pitts arrived at the rooms Ferriss and Bennett\nhad taken he found the anteroom already crowded with visitors--a knot of\ninterviewers, the manager of a lecture bureau, as well as the agent of a\npatented cereal (who sought the man of the hour for an endorsement of\nhis article), and two female reporters.\n\nDecidedly Richard Ferriss was ill; there could be no doubt about that.\nBennett had not slept the night before, but had gone to and fro about\nthe rooms tending to his wants with a solicitude and a gentleness that\nin a man so harsh and so toughly fibred seemed strangely out of place.\nBennett was far from well himself. The terrible milling which he had\nundergone had told even upon that enormous frame, but his own ailments\nwere promptly ignored now that Ferriss, the man of all men to him, was\n\"down.\"\n\n\"I didn't pull through with you, old man,\" he responded to all of\nFerriss's protests, \"to have you get sick on my hands at this time of\nday. No more of your damned foolishness now. Here's the quinine. Down\nwith it!\"\n\nBennett met Pitts at the door of Ferriss's room, and before going in\ndrew him into a corner.\n\n\"He's a sick boy, Pitts, and is going to be worse, though he's just\nenough of a fool boy not to admit it. I've seen them start off this gait\nbefore. Remember, too, when you look him over that it's not as though he\nhad been in a healthy condition before. Our work in the ice ground him\ndown about as fine as he could go and yet live, and the hardtack and\nsalt pork on the steam whalers were not a good diet for a convalescent.\nAnd see here, Pitts,\" said Bennett, clearing his throat, \"I--well, I'm\nrather fond of that fool boy in there. We are not taking any chances,\nyou understand.\"\n\nAfter the doctor had seen the chief engineer and had prescribed calomel\nand a milk diet, Bennett followed him out into the hall and accompanied\nhim to the door.\n\n\"Verdict?\" he demanded, fixing the physician intently with his small,\ndistorted eyes. But Pitts was non-committal.\n\n\"Yes, he's a sick boy, but the thing, whatever it is going to be, has\nbeen gathering slowly. He complains of headache, great weakness and\nnausea, and you speak of frequent nose-bleeds during the night. The\nabdomen is tender upon pressure, which is a symptom I would rather not\nhave found. But I can't make any positive diagnosis as yet. Some big\nsickness is coming on--that, I am afraid, is certain. I shall come out\nhere to-morrow. But, Mr. Bennett, be careful of yourself. Even steel can\nweaken, you know. You see this rabble\" (he motioned with his head toward\nthe anteroom, where the other visitors were waiting) \"that is hounding\nyou? Everybody knows where you are. Man, you must have rest. I don't\nneed to look at you more than once to know that. Get away! Get away even\nfrom your mails! Hide from everybody for a while! Don't think you can\nnurse your friend through these next few weeks, because you can't.\"\n\n\"Well,\" answered Bennett, \"wait a few days. We'll see by the end of the\nweek.\"\n\nThe week passed. Ferriss went gradually from bad to worse, though as yet\nthe disease persistently refused to declare itself. He was quite\nhelpless, and Bennett watched over him night and day, pottering around\nhim by the hour, giving him his medicines, cooking his food, and even\nwhen Ferriss complained of the hotness of the bedclothes, changing the\nvery linen that he might lie upon cool sheets. But at the end of the\nweek Dr. Pitts declared that Bennett himself was in great danger of\nbreaking down, and was of no great service to the sick man.\n\n\"To-morrow,\" said the doctor, \"I shall have a young fellow here who\nhappens to be a cousin of mine. He is an excellent trained nurse, a\nfellow we can rely upon. He'll take your place. I'll have him here\nto-morrow, and you must get away. Hide somewhere. Don't even allow your\nmail to be forwarded. The nurse and I will take care of Mr. Ferriss. You\ncan leave me your address, and I will wire you if it is necessary. Now\nbe persuaded like a reasonable man. I will stake my professional\nreputation that you will knock under if you stay here with a sick man on\nyour hands and newspaper men taking the house by storm at all hours of\nthe day. Come now, will you go? Mr. Ferriss is in no danger, and you\nwill do him more harm by staying than by going. So long as you remain\nhere you will have this raft of people in the rooms at all hours. Deny\nyourself! Keep them out! Keep out the American reporter when he goes\ngunning for a returned explorer! Do you think this,\" and he pointed\nagain to the crowd in the anteroom, \"is the right condition for a sick\nman's quarters? You are imperilling his safety, to say nothing of your\nown, by staying beside him--you draw the fire, Mr. Bennett.\"\n\n\"Well, there's something in that,\" muttered Bennett, pulling at his\nmustache. \"But--\" Bennett hesitated, then: \"Pitts, I want you to take my\nplace here if I go away. Have a nurse if you like, but I shouldn't feel\njustified in leaving the boy in his condition unless I knew you were\nwith him continually. I don't know what your practice is worth to you,\nsay for a month, or until the boy is out of danger, but make me a\nproposition. I think we can come to an understanding.\"\n\n\"But it won't be necessary to have a doctor with Mr. Ferriss constantly.\nI should see him every day and the nurse--\"\n\nBennett promptly overrode his objections. Harshly and abruptly he\nexclaimed: \"I'm not taking any chances. It shall be as I say. I want the\nboy well, and I want you and the nurse to see to it that he _gets_ well.\nI'll meet the expenses.\"\n\nBennett did not hear the doctor's response and his suggestion as to the\nadvisability of taking Ferriss to his own house in the country while he\ncould be moved. For the moment he was not listening. An idea had\nabruptly presented itself to him. He was to go to the country. But\nwhere? A grim smile began to relax the close-gripped lips and the hard\nset of the protruding jaw. He tugged again at his mustache, scowling at\nthe doctor, trying to hide his humour.\n\n\"Well, that's settled then,\" he said; \"I'll get away\nto-morrow--somewhere.\"\n\n\"Whereabouts?\" demanded the doctor. \"I shall want to let you know how we\nprogress.\"\n\nBennett chose to feel a certain irritation. What business of Pitts was\nit whom he went to see, or, rather, where he meant to go?\n\n\"You told me to hide away from everybody, not even to allow my mail to\nbe forwarded. But I'll let you know where to reach me, of course, as\nsoon as I get there. It won't be far from town.\"\n\n\"And I will take your place here with Mr. Ferriss; somebody will be with\nhim at every moment, and I shall only wire you,\" continued the doctor,\n\"in case of urgent necessity. I want you to have all the rest you can,\nand stay away as long as possible. I shan't annoy you with telegrams\nunless I must. You'll understand that no news is good news.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOn that particular morning Lloyd sat in her room in the old farmhouse\nthat she always elected to call her home as often as she visited\nBannister. It was some quarter of a mile outside the little village, and\non the road that connected it with the railway at Fourth Lake, some six\nmiles over the hills to the east. It was yet early in the morning, and\nLloyd was writing letters that she would post at Fourth Lake later in\nthe forenoon. She intended driving over to the lake. Two days before,\nLewis had arrived with Rox, the ponies and the phaeton. Lloyd's\ndog-cart, a very gorgeous, high-wheeled affair, was always kept at\nBannister.\n\nThe room in which she now sat was delightful. Everything was white, from\nthe curtains of the bed to the chintz hangings on the walls. A rug of\nwhite fur was on the floor. The panellings and wooden shutters of the\nwindows were painted white. The fireplace was set in glossy-white tiles,\nand its opening covered with a screen of white feathers. The windows\nwere flung wide, and a great flood of white sunlight came pouring into\nthe room. Lloyd herself was dressed in white, from the clean, crisp\nscarf tied about her neck to the tip of her canvas tennis shoes. And in\nall this array of white only the dull-red flame of her high-piled\nhair--in the sunshine glowing like burnished copper--set a vivid note of\ncolour, the little strands and locks about her neck and ears coruscating\nas the breeze from the open windows stirred them.\n\nThe morning was veritably royal--still, cool, and odorous of woods and\ncattle and growing grass. A great sense of gayety, of exhilaration, was\nin the air. Lloyd was all in tune with it. While she wrote her left\nelbow rested on the table, and in her left hand she held a huge, green\napple, unripe, sour, delicious beyond words, and into which she bit from\ntime to time with the silent enjoyment of a school-girl.\n\nHer letter was to Hattie's father, Mr. Campbell, and she wrote to ask if\nthe little girl might not spend a week with her at Bannister. When the\nletter was finished and addressed she thrust it into her belt, and,\nputting on her hat, ran downstairs. Lewis had brought the dog-cart to\nthe gate, and stood waiting in the road by Rox's head. But as Lloyd went\ndown the brick-paved walk of the front yard Mrs. Applegate, who owned\nthe farmhouse, and who was at once Lloyd's tenant, landlady,\nhousekeeper, and cook, appeared on the porch of the house, the head of a\nfish in her hand, and Charley-Joe, the yellow tomcat, at her heels,\neyeing her with painful intentness.\n\n\"Say, Miss Searight,\" she called, her forearm across her forehead to\nshade her eyes, the hand still holding the fish's head, \"say, while\nyou're out this morning will you keep an eye out for that dog of\nour'n--you know, Dan--the one with liver'n white spots? He's run off\nagain--ain't seen him since yesterday noon. He gets away an' goes off\nfighting other dogs over the whole blessed county. There ain't a dog big\n'r little within ten mile that Dan ain't licked. He'd sooner fight than\nhe would eat, that dog.\"\n\n\"I will, I will,\" answered Lloyd, climbing to the high seat, \"and if I\nfind him I shall drag him back by the scruff of his neck. Good-morning,\nLewis. Why have you put the overhead check on Rox?\"\n\nLewis touched his cap.\n\n\"He feels his oats some this morning, and if he gets his lower jaw agin'\nhis chest there's no holding of him, Miss--no holding of him in the\nworld.\"\n\nLloyd gathered up the reins and spoke to the horse, and Lewis stood\naside.\n\nRox promptly went up into the air on his hind legs, shaking his head\nwith a great snort.\n\n\"Steady, you old pig,\" said Lloyd, calmly. \"Soh, soh, who's trying to\nkill you?\"\n\n\"Hadn't I better come with you, Miss?\" inquired Lewis anxiously.\n\nLloyd shook her head. \"No, indeed,\" she said decisively.\n\nRox, after vindicating his own independence by the proper amount of\nshowing off, started away down the road with as high an action as he\ncould command, playing to the gallery, looking back and out of the tail\nof his eye to see if Lewis observed what a terrible fellow he was that\nmorning.\n\n\"Well, of all the critters!\" commented Mrs. Applegate from the porch.\nBut Charley-Joe, with an almost hypnotic fixity in his yellow eyes, and\nwho during the last few minutes had several times opened his mouth wide\nin an ineffectual attempt to mew, suddenly found his voice with a\nprolonged and complaining note.\n\n\"Well, heavens an' airth, take your fish, then!\" exclaimed Mrs.\nApplegate suddenly, remembering the cat. \"An' get off'n my porch with\nit.\" She pushed him away with the side of her foot, and Charley-Joe,\nwith the fish's head in his teeth, retired around the corner of the\nhouse by the rain barrel, where at intervals he could be heard growling\nto himself in a high-pitched key, pretending the approach of some\nterrible enemy.\n\nMeanwhile Lloyd, already well on her way, was having an exciting tussle\nwith Rox. The horse had begun by making an exhibition of himself for all\nwho could see, but in the end he had so worked upon his own nerves that\ninstead of frightening others he only succeeded in terrifying himself.\nHe was city-bred, and the sudden change from brick houses to open fields\nhad demoralised him. He began to have a dim consciousness of just how\nstrong he was. There was nothing vicious about him. He would not have\nlowered himself to kick, but he did want, with all the big, strong heart\nof him, to run.\n\nBut back of him there--he felt it thrilling along the tense-drawn\nreins--was a calm, powerful grip, even, steady, masterful. Turn his head\nhe could not, but he knew very well that Lloyd had taken a double twist\nupon the reins, and that her hands, even if they were gloved in white,\nwere strong--strong enough to hold him to his work. And besides this--he\ncould tell it by the very feel of the bit--he knew that she did not take\nhim very seriously, that he could not make her afraid of him. He knew\nthat she could tell at once whether he shied because he was really\nfrightened or because he wanted to break the shaft, and that in the\nlatter case he would get the whip--and mercilessly, too--across his\nhaunch, a degradation, above all things, to be avoided. And she had\ncalled him an old pig once already that morning.\n\nLloyd drove on. She keenly enjoyed this struggle between the horse's\nstrength and her own determination, her own obstinacy. No, she would not\nlet Rox have his way; she would not allow him to triumph over her for a\nsingle moment. She would neither be forced nor tricked into yielding a\nsingle point however small. She would be mistress of the situation.\n\nBy the end of half an hour she had him well in hand, and was bowling\nsmoothly along a level stretch of road at the foot of an abrupt rise of\nland covered with scrub oak and broken with outcroppings of granite of a\ncurious formation. Just beyond here the road crossed the canal by a\nnarrow--in fact, a much too narrow--plank bridge without guard-rails.\nThe wide-axled dog-cart had just sufficient room on either hand, and\nLloyd, too good a whip to take chances with so nervous a horse as Rox,\ndrew him down to a walk as she approached it. But of a sudden her eyes\nwere arrested by a curious sight. She halted the cart.\n\nAt the roadside, some fifty yards from the plank bridge, were two dogs.\nEvidently there had just been a dreadful fight. Here and there a stone\nwas streaked with blood. The grass and smaller bushes were flattened\nout, and tufts of hair were scattered about upon the ground. Of the two\ndogs, Lloyd recognised one upon the instant. It was Dan, the \"liver'n\nwhite\" fox-hound of the farmhouse--the fighter and terror of the\ncountry. But he was lying upon his side now, the foreleg broken, or\nrather crushed, as if in a vise; the throat torn open, the life-blood in\na great pool about his head. He was dead, or in the very throes of\ndeath. Poor Dan, he had fought his last fight, had found more than his\nmatch at last.\n\nLloyd looked at the other dog--the victor; then looked at him a second\ntime and a third.\n\n\"Well,\" she murmured, \"that's a strange-looking dog.\"\n\nIn fact, he was a curious animal. His broad, strong body was covered\nwith a brown fur as dense, as thick, and as soft as a wolf's; the ears\nwere pricked and pointed, the muzzle sharp, the eyes slant and beady.\nThe breast was disproportionately broad, the forelegs short and\napparently very powerful. Around his neck was a broad nickelled collar.\n\nBut as Lloyd sat in the cart watching him he promptly demonstrated the\nfact that his nature was as extraordinary as his looks. He turned again\nfrom a momentary inspection of the intruders, sniffed once or twice at\nhis dead enemy, then suddenly began to eat him.\n\nLloyd's gorge rose with anger and disgust. Even if Dan had been killed,\nit had been in fair fight, and there could be no doubt that Dan himself\nhad been the aggressor. She could even feel a little respect for the\nconqueror of the champion, but to turn upon the dead foe, now that the\nheat of battle was past, and (in no spirit of hate or rage) deliberately\nto eat him. What a horror! She took out her whip.\n\n\"Shame on you!\" she exclaimed. \"Ugh! what a savage; I shan't allow you!\"\n\nA farm-hand was coming across the plank bridge, and as he drew near the\ncart Lloyd asked him to hold Rox for a moment. Rox was one of those\nhorses who, when standing still, are docile as a kitten, and she had no\nhesitancy in leaving him with a man at his head. She jumped out, the\nwhip in her hand. Dan was beyond all help, but she wanted at least to\ntake his collar back to Mrs. Applegate. The strange dog permitted\nhimself to be driven off a little distance. Part of his strangeness\nseemed to be that through it all he retained a certain placidity of\ntemper. There was no ferocity in his desire to eat Dan.\n\n\"That's just what makes it so disgusting,\" said Lloyd, shaking her whip\nat him. He sat down upon his haunches, eyeing her calmly, his tongue\nlolling. When she had unbuckled Dan's collar and tossed it into the cart\nunder the seat she inquired of the farm-hand as to where the new dog\ncame from.\n\n\"It beats me, Miss Searight,\" he answered; \"never saw such a bird in\nthese parts before; t'other belongs down to Applegate's.\"\n\n\"Come, let's have a look at you,\" said Lloyd, putting back the whip;\n\"let me see your collar.\"\n\nDisregarding the man's warning, she went up to the stranger, whistling\nand holding out her hand, and he came up to her--a little suspiciously\nat first, but in the end wagging his tail, willing to be friendly. Lloyd\nparted the thick fur around his neck and turned the plate of the collar\nto the light. On the plate was engraved: \"Kamiska, Arctic S.S. 'Freja.'\nReturn to Ward Bennett.\"\n\n\"Anything on the collar?\" asked the man.\n\nLloyd settled a hairpin in a coil of hair at the back of her neck.\n\n\"Nothing--nothing that I can make out.\"\n\nShe climbed into the cart again and dismissed the farm-hand with a\nquarter. He disappeared around the turn of the road. But as she was\nabout to drive on, Lloyd heard a great clattering of stones upon the\nhill above her, a crashing in the bushes, and a shrill whistle thrice\nrepeated. Kamiska started up at once, cocking alternate ears, then\nturned about and ran up the hill to meet Ward Bennett, who came\nscrambling down, jumping from one granite outcrop to another, holding on\nthe whiles by the lower branches of the scrub oak-trees.\n\nHe was dressed as if for an outing, in knickerbockers and huge,\nhob-nailed shoes. He wore an old shooting-coat and a woollen cap; a\nlittle leather sack was slung from his shoulder, and in his hand he\ncarried a short-handled geologist's hammer.\n\nAnd then, after so long a time, Lloyd saw his face again--the rugged,\nunhandsome face; the massive jaw, huge almost to deformity; the great,\nbrutal, indomitable lips; the square-cut chin with its forward,\naggressive thrust; the narrow forehead, seamed and contracted, and the\ntwinkling, keen eyes so marred by the cast, so heavily shadowed by the\nshaggy eyebrows. When he spoke the voice came heavy and vibrant from the\ngreat chest, a harsh, deep bass, a voice in which to command men, not a\nvoice in which to talk to women.\n\nLloyd, long schooled to self-repression and the control of her emotions\nwhen such repression and control were necessary, sat absolutely moveless\non her high seat, her hands only shutting tighter and tighter upon the\nreins. She had often wondered how she would feel, what was to be her\ndominant impulse, at such moments as these, and now she realised that it\nwas not so much joy, not so much excitement, as a resolute determination\nnot for one instant to lose her poise.\n\nShe was thinking rapidly. For four years they had not met. At one time\nshe believed him to be dead. But in the end he had been saved, had come\nback, and, ignoring the plaudits of an entire Christendom, had addressed\nhimself straight to her. For one of them, at least, this meeting was a\ncrisis. What would they first say to each other? how be equal to the\nsituation? how rise to its dramatic possibilities? But the moment had\ncome to them suddenly, had found them all unprepared. There was no time\nto think of adequate words. Afterward, when she reviewed this encounter,\nshe told herself that they both had failed, and that if the meeting had\nbeen faithfully reproduced upon the stage or in the pages of a novel it\nwould have seemed tame and commonplace. These two, living the actual\nscene, with all the deep, strong, real emotions of them surging to the\nsurface, the vitality of them, all aroused and vibrating, suddenly\nconfronting actuality itself, were not even natural; were not even \"true\nto life.\" It was as though they had parted but a fortnight ago.\n\nBennett caught his cap from his head and came toward her, exclaiming:\n\n\"Miss Searight, I believe.\"\n\nAnd she, reaching her right hand over the left, that still held the\nreins, leaned from her high seat, shaking hands with him and replying:\n\n\"Well--Mr. Bennett, I'm so very glad to see you again. Where did you\ncome from?\"\n\n\"From the City--and from seventy-six degrees north latitude.\"\n\n\"I congratulate you. We had almost given up hope of you.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" he answered. \"We were not so roseate with hope\nourselves--all the time. But I have not felt as though I had really come\nback until this--well, until I had reached--the road between Bannister\nand Fourth Lake, for instance,\" and his face relaxed to its\ncharacteristic grim smile.\n\n\"You reached it too late, then,\" she responded. \"Your dog has killed our\nDan, and, what is much worse, started to eat him. He's a perfect\nsavage.\"\n\n\"Kamiska? Well,\" he added, reflectively, \"it's my fault for setting her\na bad example. I ate her trace-mate, and was rather close to eating\nKamiska herself at one time. But I didn't come down here to talk about\nthat.\"\n\n\"You are looking rather worn, Mr. Bennett.\"\n\n\"I suppose. The doctor sent me into the country to call back the roses\nto my pallid cheek. So I came down here--to geologise. I presume that\nexcuse will do as well as another.\" Then suddenly he cried: \"Hello,\nsteady there; _quick_, Miss Searight!\"\n\nIt all came so abruptly that neither of them could afterward reconstruct\nthe scene with any degree of accuracy. Probably in scrambling down the\nsteep slope of the bank Bennett had loosened the earth or smaller stones\nthat hitherto had been barely sufficient support to the mass of earth,\ngravel, rocks, and bushes that all at once, and with a sharp, crackling\nnoise, slid downward toward the road from the overhanging bank. The slip\nwas small, hardly more than three square yards of earth moving from its\nplace, but it came with a smart, quick rush, throwing up a cloud of dust\nand scattering pebbles and hard clods of dirt far before its advance.\n\nAs Rox leaped Lloyd threw her weight too suddenly on the reins, the\nhorse arched his neck, and the overhead check snapped like a\nharp-string. Again he reared from the object of his terror, shaking his\nhead from side to side, trying to get a purchase on the bit. Then his\nlower jaw settled against his chest, and all at once he realised that no\npair of human hands could hold him now. He did not rear again; his\nhaunches suddenly lowered, and with the hoofs of his hind feet he began\nfeeling the ground for his spring. But now Bennett was at his head,\ngripping at the bit, striving to thrust him back. Lloyd, half risen from\nher seat, each rein wrapped twice around her hands, her long, strong\narms at their fullest reach, held back against the horse with all her\nmight, her body swaying and jerking with his plunges. But the overhead\ncheck once broken Lloyd might as well have pulled against a locomotive.\nBennett was a powerful man by nature, but his great strength had been\nnot a little sapped by his recent experiences. Between the instant his\nhand caught at the bit and that in which Rox had made his first\nineffectual attempt to spring forward he recognised the inequality of\nthe contest. He could hold Rox back for a second or two, perhaps three,\nthen the horse would get away from him. He shot a glance about him. Not\ntwenty yards away was the canal and the perilously narrow bridge--the\nbridge without the guard-rail.\n\n\"Quick, Miss Searight!\" he shouted. \"Jump! We can't hold him. Quick, do\nas I tell you, jump!\"\n\nBut even as he spoke Rox dragged him from his feet, his hoofs trampling\nthe hollow road till it reverberated like the roll of drums. Bracing\nhimself against every unevenness of the ground, his teeth set, his face\nscarlet, the veins in his neck swelling, suddenly blue-black, Bennett\nwrenched at the bit till the horse's mouth went bloody. But all to no\npurpose; faster and faster Rox was escaping from his control.\n\n\"Jump, I tell you!\" he shouted again, looking over his shoulder;\n\"another second and he's away.\"\n\nLloyd dropped the reins and turned to jump. But the lap-robe had slipped\ndown to the bottom of the cart when she had risen, and was in a tangle\nabout her feet. The cart was rocking like a ship in a storm. Twice she\ntried to free herself, holding to the dashboard with one hand. Then the\ncart suddenly lurched forward and she fell to her knees. Rox was off; it\nwas all over.\n\nNot quite. In one brief second of time--a hideous vision come and gone\nbetween two breaths--Lloyd saw the fearful thing done there in the road,\nalmost within reach of her hand. She saw the man and horse at grapples,\nthe yellow reach of road that lay between her and the canal, the canal\nitself, and the narrow bridge. Then she saw the short-handled\ngeologist's hammer gripped in Bennett's fist heave high in the air. Down\nit came, swift, resistless, terrible--one blow. The cart tipped forward\nas Rox, his knees bowing from under him, slowly collapsed. Then he\nrolled upon the shaft that snapped under him, and the cart vibrated from\nend to end as a long, shuddering tremble ran through him with his last\ndeep breath.\n\n\n\n\nV.\n\n\nWhen Lloyd at length managed to free herself and jump to the ground\nBennett came quickly toward her and drew her away to the side of the\nroad.\n\n\"Are you hurt?\" he demanded. \"Tell me, are you hurt?\"\n\n\"No, no; not in the least.\"\n\n\"Why in the world did you want to drive such a horse? Don't ever take\nsuch chances again. I won't have it.\"\n\nFor a few moments Lloyd was too excited to trust herself to talk, and\ncould only stand helplessly to one side, watching Bennett as he stripped\noff the harness from the dead horse, stowed it away under the seat of\nthe cart, and rolled the cart itself to the edge of the road. Then at\nlength she said, trying to smile and to steady her voice:\n\n\"It--it seems to me, Mr. Bennett, you do about--about as you like with\nmy sta-bub-ble.\"\n\n\"Sit down!\" he commanded, \"you are trembling all over. Sit down on that\nrock there.\"\n\n\"--and with me,\" she added, sinking down upon the boulder he had\nindicated with a movement of his head, his hands busy with the harness.\n\n\"I'm sorry I had to do that,\" he explained; \"but there was no help for\nit--nothing else to do. He would have had you in the canal in another\nsecond, if he did not kill you on the way there.\"\n\n\"Poor old Rox,\" murmured Lloyd; \"I was very fond of Rox.\"\n\nBennett put himself in her way as she stepped forward. He had the\nlap-robe over his arm and the whip in his hand.\n\n\"No, don't look at him. He's not a pretty sight. Come, shall I take you\nhome? Don't worry about the cart; I will see that it is sent back.\"\n\n\"And that Rox is buried--somewhere? I don't want him left out there for\nthe crows.\" In spite of Bennett's injunction she looked over her\nshoulder for a moment as they started off down the road. \"I only hope\nyou were sure there was nothing else to do, Mr. Bennett,\" she said.\n\n\"There was no time to think,\" he answered, \"and I wasn't taking any\nchances.\"\n\nBut the savagery of the whole affair stuck in Lloyd's imagination. There\nwas a primitiveness, a certain hideous simplicity in the way Bennett had\nmet the situation that filled her with wonder and with even a little\nterror and mistrust of him. The vast, brutal directness of the deed was\nout of place and incongruous at this end-of-the-century time. It ignored\ntwo thousand years of civilisation. It was a harsh, clanging, brazen\nnote, powerful, uncomplicated, which came jangling in, discordant and\ninharmonious with the tune of the age. It savoured of the days when men\nfought the brutes with their hands or with their clubs. But also it was\nan indication of a force and a power of mind that stopped at nothing to\nattain its ends, that chose the shortest cut, the most direct means,\ndisdainful of hesitation, holding delicacy and finessing in measureless\ncontempt, rushing straight to its object, driving in, breaking down\nresistance, smashing through obstacles with a boundless, crude, blind\nBrobdignag power, to oppose which was to be trampled under foot upon the\ninstant.\n\nIt was long before their talk turned from the incident of the morning,\nbut when it did its subject was Richard Ferriss. Bennett was sounding\nhis praises and commending upon his pluck and endurance during the\nretreat from the ship, when Lloyd, after hesitating once or twice,\nasked:\n\n\"How is Mr. Ferriss? In your note you said he was ill.\"\n\n\"So he is,\" he told her, \"and I could not have left him if I was not\nsure I was doing him harm by staying. But the doctor is to wire me if he\ngets any worse, and only if he does. I am to believe that no news is\ngood news.\"\n\nBut this meeting with Lloyd and the intense excitement of those few\nmoments by the canal had quite driven from Bennett's mind the fact that\nhe had _not_ forwarded his present address either to Ferriss or to his\ndoctor. He had so intended that morning, but all the faculties of his\nmind were suddenly concentrated upon another issue. For the moment he\nbelieved that he had actually written to Dr. Pitts, as he had planned,\nand when he thought of his intended message at all, thought of it as an\naccomplished fact. The matter did not occur to him again.\n\nAs he walked by Lloyd's side, listening to her and talking to her,\nsnapping the whip the while, or flicking the heads from the mullein\nstalks by the roadside with its lash, he was thinking how best he might\nsay to her what he had come from the City to say. To lead up to his\nsubject, to guide the conversation, to prepare the right psychological\nmoment skilfully and without apparent effort, were maneuvers in the game\nthat Bennett ignored and despised. He knew only that he loved her, that\nshe was there at his side, that the object of all his desires and hopes\nwas within his reach. Straight as a homing pigeon he went to his goal.\n\n\"Miss Searight,\" he began, his harsh, bass voice pitched even lower than\nusual, \"what do you think I am down here for? This is not the only part\nof the world where I could recuperate, I suppose, and as for spending\nGod's day in chipping at stones, like a professor of a young ladies'\nseminary\"--he hurled the hammer from him into the bushes--\"that for\ngeology! Now we can talk. You know very well that I love you, and I\nbelieve that you love me. I have come down here to ask you to marry me.\"\n\nLloyd might have done any one of a dozen things--might have answered in\nany one of a dozen ways. But what she did do, what she did say, took\nBennett completely by surprise. A little coldly and very calmly she\nanswered:\n\n\"You believe--you say you believe that I--\" she broke off, then began\nagain: \"It is not right for you to say that to me. I have never led you\nto believe that I cared for you. Whatever our relations are to be, let\nus have that understood at once.\"\n\nBennett uttered an impatient exclamation \"I am not good at fencing and\nquibbling,\" he declared. \"I tell you that I love you with all my heart.\nI tell you that I want you to be my wife, and I tell you that I know you\ndo love me. You are not like other women; why should you coquette with\nme? Good God! Are you not big enough to be above such things? I know you\nare. Of all the people in the world we two ought to be above pretence,\nought to understand each other. If I did not know you cared for me I\nwould not have spoken.\"\n\n\"I don't understand you,\" she answered. \"I think we had better talk of\nother things this morning.\"\n\n\"I came down here to talk of just this and nothing else,\" he declared.\n\n\"Very well, then,\" she said, squaring her shoulders with a quick, brisk\nmovement, \"we will talk of it. You say we two should understand each\nother. Let us come to the bottom of things at once. I despise quibbling\nand fencing as much, perhaps, as you. Tell me how have I ever led you to\nbelieve that I cared for you?\"\n\n\"At a time when our last hope was gone,\" answered Bennett, meeting her\neyes, \"when I was very near to death and thought that I should go to my\nGod within the day, I was made happier than I think I ever was in my\nlife before by finding out that I was dear to you--that you loved me.\"\n\nLloyd searched his face with a look of surprise and bewilderment.\n\n\"I do not understand you,\" she repeated.\n\n\"Oh!\" exclaimed Bennett with sudden vehemence, \"you could say it to\nFerriss; why can't you say it to me?\"\n\n\"To Mr. Ferriss?\"\n\n\"You could tell _him_ that you cared.\"\n\n\"I--tell Mr. Ferriss--that I cared for you?\" She began to smile. \"You\nare a little absurd, Mr. Bennett.\"\n\n\"And I cannot see why you should deny it now. Or if anything has caused\nyou to change your mind--to be sorry for what you said, why should I not\nknow it? Even a petty thief may be heard in his own defence. I loved you\nbecause I believed you to be a woman, a great, strong, noble, man's\nwoman, above little things, above the little, niggling, contemptible\ndevices of the drawing-room. I loved you because the great things of the\nworld interested you, because you had no place in your life for petty\ngraces, petty affectations, petty deceits and shams and insincerities.\nIf you did not love me, why did you say so? If you do love me now, why\nshould you not admit it? Do you think you can play with me? Do you think\nyou can coquette with me? If you were small enough to stoop to such\nmeans, do you think I am small enough to submit to them? I have known\nFerriss too well. I know him to be incapable of such falsity as you\nwould charge him with. To have told such a lie, such an uncalled-for,\nuseless, gratuitous lie, is a thing he could not have done. You must\nhave told him that you cared. Why aren't you--you of all women--brave\nenough, strong enough, big enough to stand by your words?\"\n\n\"Because I never said them. What do you think of me? Even if I did care,\ndo you suppose I would say as much--and to another man? Oh!\" she\nexclaimed with sudden indignation, \"let's talk of something else. This\nis too--preposterous.\"\n\n\"You never told Ferriss that you cared for me?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\nBennett took off his cap. \"Very well, then. That is enough. Good-bye,\nMiss Searight.\"\n\n\"Do you believe I told Mr. Ferriss I loved you?\"\n\n\"I do not believe that the man who has been more to me than a brother is\na liar and a rascal.\"\n\n\"Good-morning, Mr. Bennett.\"\n\nThey had come rather near to the farmhouse by this time. Without another\nword Bennett gave the whip and the lap-robe into her hands, and, turning\nupon his heel, walked away down the road.\n\nLloyd told Lewis as much of the morning's accident by the canal as was\nnecessary, and gave orders about the dog-cart and the burying of Rox.\nThen slowly, her eyes fixed and wide, she went up to her own room and,\nwithout removing either her hat or her gloves, sat down upon the edge of\nthe bed, letting her hands fall limply into her lap, gazing abstractedly\nat the white curtain just stirring at the open window.\n\nShe could not say which hurt her most--that Ferriss had told the lie or\nthat Bennett believed it. But why, in heaven's name why, had Ferriss so\nspoken to Bennett; what object had he in view; what had he to gain by\nit? Why had Ferriss, the man who loved her, chosen so to humiliate her,\nto put her in a position so galling to her pride, her dignity? Bennett,\ntoo, loved her. How could he believe that she had so demeaned herself?\n\nShe had been hurt and to the heart, at a point where she believed\nherself most unassailable, and he who held the weapon was the man that\nwith all the heart of her and soul of her she loved.\n\nMuch of the situation was all beyond her. Try as she would she could not\nunderstand. One thing, however, she saw clearly, unmistakably: Bennett\nbelieved that she loved him, believed that she had told as much to\nFerriss, and that when she had denied all knowledge of Ferriss's lie she\nwas only coquetting with him. She knew Bennett and his character well\nenough to realise that an idea once rooted in his mind was all but\nineradicable. Bennett was not a man of easy changes; nothing mobile\nabout him.\n\nThe thought of this belief of Bennett's was intolerable. As she sat\nthere alone in her white room the dull crimson of her cheeks flamed\nsuddenly scarlet, and with a quick, involuntary gesture she threw her\nhand, palm outward, across her face to hide it from the sunlight. She\nwent quickly from one mood to another. Now her anger grew suddenly hot\nagainst Ferriss. How had he dared? How had he dared to put this\nindignity, this outrageous insult, upon her? Now her wrath turned upon\nBennett. What audacity had been his to believe that she would so forget\nherself? She set her teeth in her impotent anger, rising to her feet,\nher hands clenching, tears of sheer passion starting to her eyes.\n\nFor the greater part of the afternoon she kept to her room, pacing the\nfloor from wall to wall, trying to think clearly, to resolve upon\nsomething that would readjust the situation, that would give her back\nher peace of mind, her dignity, and her happiness of the early morning.\nFor now the great joy that had come to her in his safe return was all\nbut gone. For one moment she even told herself she could not love him,\nbut the next was willing to admit that it was only because of her love\nof him, as strong and deep as ever, that the humiliation cut so deeply\nand cruelly now. Ferriss had lied about her, and Bennett had believed\nthe lie. To meet Bennett again under such circumstances was not to be\nthought of for one moment. Her vacation was spoiled; the charm of the\ncountry had vanished. Lloyd returned to the City the next day.\n\nShe found that she was glad to get back to her work. The subdued murmur\nof the City that hourly assaulted her windows was a relief to her ears\nafter the profound and numbing silence of the country. The square was\nnever so beautiful as at this time of summer, and even the restless\nshadow pictures, that after dark were thrown upon the ceiling of her\nroom by the electrics shining through the great elms in the square\nbelow, were a pleasure.\n\nOn the morning after her arrival and as she was unpacking her trunk Miss\nDouglass came into her room and seated herself, according to her custom,\non the couch. After some half-hour's give-and-take talk, the fever nurse\nsaid:\n\n\"Do you remember, Lloyd, what I told you about typhoid in the\nspring--that it was almost epidemic?\"\n\nLloyd nodded, turning about from her trunk, her arms full of dresses.\n\n\"It's worse than ever now,\" continued Miss Douglass; \"three of our\npeople have been on cases only in the short time you have been away. And\nthere's a case out in Medford that has killed one nurse.\"\n\n\"Well!\" exclaimed Lloyd in some astonishment, \"it seems to me that one\nshould confine typhoid easily enough.\"\n\n\"Not always, not always,\" answered the other; \"a virulent case would be\nquite as bad as yellow fever or smallpox. You remember when we were at\nthe hospital Miss Helmuth, that little Polish nurse, contracted it from\nher case and died even before her patient did. Then there was Eva\nBlayne. She very nearly died. I did like the way Miss Wakeley took this\ncase out at Medford even when the other nurse had died. She never\nhesitated for--\"\n\n\"Has one of our people got this case?\" inquired Lloyd.\n\n\"Of course. Didn't I tell you?\"\n\n\"I hope we cure it,\" said Lloyd, her trunk-tray in her hands. \"I don't\nthink we have ever lost a case yet when good nursing could pull it\nthrough, and in typhoid the whole treatment really is the nursing.\"\n\n\"Lloyd,\" said Miss Douglass decisively, \"I would give anything I can\nthink of now to have been on that hip disease case of yours and have\nbrought my patient through as you did. You should hear what Dr. Street\nsays of you--and the little girl's father. By the way, I had nearly\nforgotten. Hattie Campbell--that's her name, isn't it?--telephoned to\nknow if you had come back from the country yet. That was yesterday. I\nsaid we expected you to-day, and she told me to say she was coming to\nsee you.\"\n\nThe next afternoon toward three o'clock Hattie and her father drove to\nthe square in an open carriage, Hattie carrying a great bunch of violets\nfor Lloyd. The little invalid was well on the way to complete recovery\nby now. Sometimes she was allowed to walk a little, but as often as not\nher maid wheeled her about in an invalid's chair. She drove out in the\ncarriage frequently by way of exercise. She would, no doubt, always limp\na little, but in the end it was certain she would be sound and strong.\nFor Hattie and her father Lloyd had become a sort of tutelary\nsemi-deity. In what was left of the family she had her place, hardly\nless revered than even the dead wife. Campbell himself, who had made a\nfortune in Bessemer steel, a well-looking, well-groomed gentleman,\nsmooth-shaven and with hair that was none too gray, more than once\ncaught himself standing before Lloyd's picture that stood on the\nmantelpiece in Hattie's room, looking at it vaguely as he clipped the\nnib from his cigar.\n\nBut on this occasion as the carriage stopped in front of the ample pile\nof the house Hattie called out, \"Oh, there she is now,\" and Lloyd came\ndown the steps, carrying her nurse's bag in her hand.\n\n\"Are we too late?\" began Hattie; \"are you going out; are you on a case?\nIs that why you've got your bag? We thought you were on a vacation.\"\n\nCampbell, yielding to a certain feeling of uneasiness that Lloyd should\nstand on the curb while he remained seated, got out of the carriage and\nstood at her side, gravely listening to the talk between the nurse and\nher one-time patient. Lloyd was obliged to explain, turning now to\nHattie, now to her father. She told them that she was in something of a\nhurry. She had just been specially called to take a very bad case of\ntyphoid fever in a little suburb of the City, called Medford. It was not\nher turn to go, but the physicians in charge of the case, as sometimes\nhappened, had asked especially for her.\n\n\"One of our people, a young woman named Miss Wakeley, has been on this\ncase,\" she continued, \"but it seems she has allowed herself to contract\nthe disease herself. She went to the hospital this noon.\"\n\nCampbell, his gravity suddenly broken up, exclaimed:\n\n\"Surely, Miss Searight, this is not the same case I read of in\nyesterday's paper--it must be, too--Medford was the name of the place.\nThat case has killed one nurse already, and now the second one is down.\nDon't tell me you are going to take the same case.\"\n\n\"It is the same case,\" answered Lloyd, \"and, of course, I am going to\ntake it. Did you ever hear of a nurse doing otherwise? Why, it would\nseem--seem so--funny--\"\n\nThere was no dissuading her, and Campbell and Hattie soon ceased even to\ntry. She was impatient to be gone. The station was close at hand, and\nshe would not hear of taking the carriage thither. However, before she\nleft them she recurred again to the subject of her letter to Mr.\nCampbell, and then and there it was decided that Hattie and her maid\nshould spend the following ten days at Lloyd's place in Bannister. The\nstill country air, now that Hattie was able to take the short journey,\nwould be more to her than many medicines, and the ponies and Lloyd's\nphaeton would be left there with Lewis for her use.\n\n\"And write often, won't you, Miss Searight?\" exclaimed Hattie as Lloyd\nwas saying good-bye. Lloyd shook her head.\n\n\"Not that of all things,\" she answered. \"If I did that we might have\nyou, too, down with typhoid. But you may write to me, and I hope you\nwill,\" and she gave Hattie her new address.\n\n\"Harriet,\" said Campbell as the carriage drove back across the square,\nthe father and daughter waving their hands to Lloyd, briskly on her way\nto the railroad station, \"Harriet.\"\n\n\"Yes, papa.\"\n\n\"There goes a noble woman. Pluck, intelligence, strong will--she has\nthem all--and a great big heart that--heart that--\" He clipped the end\nof a cigar thoughtfully and fell silent.\n\nA day or two later, as Hattie was sitting in her little wheel-chair on\nthe veranda of Mrs. Applegate's house watching Charley-Joe hunting\ngrasshoppers underneath the currant bushes, she was surprised by the\nsharp closing of the front gate. A huge man with one squint eye and a\nheavy, square-cut jaw was coming up the walk, followed by a\nstrange-looking dog. Charley-Joe withdrew, swiftly to his particular\nhole under the veranda, moving rapidly, his body low to the ground, and\ntaking an unnecessary number of very short steps.\n\nThe little city-bred girl distinguished the visitor from a country man\nat once. Hattie had ideas of her own as to propriety, and so rose to her\nfeet as Bennett came up, and after a moment's hesitation made him a\nlittle bow. Bennett at once gravely took off his cap.\n\n\"Excuse me,\" he said as though Hattie were twenty-five instead of\ntwelve. \"Is Miss Searight at home?\"\n\n\"Oh,\" exclaimed Hattie, delighted, \"do you know Miss Searight? She was\nmy nurse when I was so sick--because you know I had hip disease and\nthere was an operation. No, she's not here any more. She's gone away,\ngone back to the City.\"\n\n\"Gone back to the City?\"\n\n\"Yes, three or four days ago. But I'm going to write to her this\nafternoon. Shall I say who called?\" Then, without waiting for a reply,\nshe added, \"I guess I had better introduce myself. My name is Harriet\nCampbell, and my papa is Craig V. Campbell, of the Hercules Wrought\nSteel Company in the City. Won't you have a chair?\"\n\nThe little convalescent and the arctic explorer shook hands with great\nsolemnity.\n\n\"I'm so pleased to meet you,\" said Bennett. \"I haven't a card, but my\nname is Ward Bennett--of the Freja expedition,\" he added. But, to his\nrelief, the little girl had not heard of him.\n\n\"Very well,\" she said, \"I'll tell Miss Searight Mr. Bennett called.\"\n\n\"No,\" he replied, hesitatingly, \"no, you needn't do that.\"\n\n\"Why, she won't answer my letter, you know,\" explained Hattie,\n\"because she is afraid her letters would give me typhoid fever,\nthat they might\"--she continued carefully, hazarding a remembered\nphrase--\"carry the contagion. You see she has gone to nurse a dreadful\ncase of typhoid fever out at Medford, near the City, and we're so worried\nand anxious about her--papa and I. One nurse that had this case has died\nalready and another one has caught the disease and is very sick, and Miss\nSearight, though she knew just how dangerous it was, would go, just\nlike--like--\" Hattie hesitated, then confused memories of her school\nreader coming to her, finished with \"like Casabianca.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said Bennett, turning his head so as to fix her with his own good\neye. \"She has gone to nurse a typhoid fever patient, has she?\"\n\n\"Yes, and papa told me--\" and Hattie became suddenly very grave, \"that\nwe might--might--oh, dear--never see her again.\"\n\n\"Hum! Whereabouts is this place in Medford? She gave you her address;\nwhat is it?\" Hattie told him, and he took himself abruptly away.\n\nBennett had gone some little distance down the road before the real\nshock came upon him. Lloyd was in a position of imminent peril; her life\nwas in the issue. With blind, unreasoned directness he leaped at once to\nthis conclusion, and as he strode along with teeth and fists tight shut\nhe kept muttering to himself: \"She may die, she may die--we--we may\nnever see her again.\" Then suddenly came the fear, the sickening sink of\nheart, the choke at the throat, first the tightening and then the sudden\nrelaxing of all the nerves. Lashed and harried by the sense of a fearful\ncalamity, an unspeakable grief that was pursuing after him, Bennett did\nnot stop to think, to reflect. He chose instantly to believe that Lloyd\nwas near her death, and once the idea was fixed in his brain it was not\nthereafter to be reasoned away. Suddenly, at a turn in the road, he\nstopped, his hands deep in his pockets, his bootheel digging into the\nground. \"Now, then,\" he exclaimed, \"what's to be done?\"\n\nJust one thing: Lloyd must leave the case at once, that very day if it\nwere possible. He must save her; must turn her back from this\ndestruction toward which she was rushing, impelled by such a foolish,\nmistaken notion of duty.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said, \"there's just that to be done, and, by God! it shall be\ndone.\"\n\nBut would Lloyd be turned back from a course she had chosen for herself?\nCould he persuade her? Then with this thought of possible opposition\nBennett's resolve all at once tightened to the sticking point. Never in\nthe darkest hours of his struggle with the arctic ice had his\ndetermination grown so fierce; never had his resolution so girded\nitself, so nerved itself to crush down resistance. The force of his will\nseemed brusquely to be quadrupled and decupled. He would do as he\ndesired; come what might he would gain his end. He would stop at\nnothing, hesitate at nothing. It would probably be difficult to get her\nfrom her post, but with all his giant's strength Bennett set himself to\ngain her safety.\n\nA great point that he believed was in his favour, a consideration that\ninfluenced him to adopt so irrevocable a resolution, was his belief that\nLloyd loved him. Bennett was not a woman's man. Men he could understand\nand handle like so many manikins, but the nature of his life and work\ndid not conduce to a knowledge of women. Bennett did not understand\nthem. In his interview with Lloyd when she had so strenuously denied\nFerriss' story Bennett could not catch the ring of truth. It had gotten\ninto his mind that Lloyd loved him. He believed easily what he wanted to\nbelieve, and his faith in Lloyd's love for him had become a part and\nparcel of his fundamental idea of things, not readily to be driven out\neven by Lloyd herself.\n\nBennett's resolution was taken. Never had he failed in accomplishing\nthat upon which he set his mind. He would not fail now. Beyond a certain\nlimit--a limit which now he swiftly reached and passed--Bennett's\ndetermination to carry his point became, as it were, a sort of\nobsession; the sweep of the tremendous power he unchained carried his\nown self along with it in its resistless onrush. At such, times there\nwas no light of reason in his actions. He saw only his point, beheld\nonly his goal; deaf to all voices that would call him back, blind to all\nconsideration that would lead him to swerve, reckless of everything that\nhe trampled under foot, he stuck to his aim until that aim was an\naccomplished fact. When the grip of the Ice had threatened to close upon\nhim and crush him, he had hurled himself against its barriers with an\nenergy and resolve to conquer that was little short of directed frenzy.\nSo it was with him now.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen Lloyd had parted from the Campbells in the square before the house,\nshe had gone directly to the railway station of a suburban line, and,\nwithin the hour, was on her way to Medford. As always happened when an\ninteresting case was to be treated, her mind became gradually filled\nwith it to the exclusion of everything else. The Campbells, and\nBennett's ready acceptance of a story that put her in so humiliating a\nlight, were forgotten as the train swept her from the heat and dust of\nthe City out into the green reaches of country to the southward. What\nhad been done upon the case she had no means of telling. She only knew\nthat the case was of unusual virulence and well advanced. It had killed\none nurse already and seriously endangered the life of another, but so\nfar from reflecting on the danger to herself, Lloyd felt a certain\nexhilaration in the thought that she was expected to succeed where\nothers had succumbed. Another battle with the Enemy was at hand, the\nEnemy who, though conquered on a hundred fields, must inevitably triumph\nin the end. Once again this Enemy had stooped and caught a human being\nin his cold grip. Once again Life and Death were at grapples, and Death\nwas strong, and from out the struggle a cry had come--had come to her--a\ncry for help.\n\nAll the exuberance of battle grew big within her breast. She was\nimpatient to be there--there at hand--to face the Enemy again across the\nsick-bed, where she had so often faced and outfought him before; and,\nmatching her force against his force, her obstinacy against his\nstrength--the strength that would pull the life from her grasp--her\nsleepless vigilance against his stealth, her intelligence against his\ncunning, her courage against his terrors, her resistance against his\nattack, her skill against his strategy, her science against his\nworld-old, worldwide experience, win the fight, save the life, hold firm\nagainst his slow, resistless pull and triumph again, if it was only for\nthe day.\n\nSucceed she would and must. Her inborn obstinacy, her sturdy refusal to\nyield her ground, whatever it should be, her stubborn power of\nresistance, her tenacity of her chosen course, came to her aid as she\ndrew swiftly near to the spot whereon the battle would be fought.\nMentally she braced herself, holding back with all her fine,\nhard-tempered, native strength. No, she would not yield the life to the\nEnemy; no, she would not give up; no, she would not recede. Let the\nEnemy do his worst--she was strong against his efforts.\n\nAt Medford, which she reached toward four in the afternoon, after an\nhour's ride from the City, she found a conveyance waiting for her, and\nwas driven rapidly through streets bordered with villas and closely\nshaven lawns to a fair-sized country seat on the outskirts of the town.\nThe housekeeper met her at the door with the information that the doctor\nwas, at the moment, in the sick-room, and had left orders that the nurse\nshould be brought to him the moment she arrived. The housekeeper showed\nLloyd the way to the second landing, knocking upon the half-open door at\nthe end of the hall, and ushering her in without waiting for an answer.\n\nLloyd took in the room at a glance--the closely drawn curtains, the\nscreen between the bed and the windows, the doctor standing on the\nhearth-rug, and the fever-inflamed face of the patient on the pillow.\nThen all her power of self-repression could not keep her from uttering a\nsmothered exclamation.\n\nFor she, the woman who, with all the savage energy of him, Bennett\nloved, had, at peril of her life, come to nurse Bennett's nearest\nfriend, the man of all others dear to him--Richard Ferriss.\n\n\n\n\nVI.\n\n\nTwo days after Dr. Pitts had brought Ferriss to his country house in the\noutskirts of Medford he had been able to diagnose his sickness as\ntyphoid fever, and at once had set about telegraphing the fact to\nBennett. Then it had occurred to him that he did not know where Bennett\nhad gone. Bennett had omitted notifying him of his present whereabouts,\nand, acting upon Dr. Pitts' advice, had hidden himself away from\neverybody. Neither at his club nor at his hotel, where his mail\naccumulated in extraordinary quantities, had any forwarding address been\nleft. Bennett would not even know that Ferriss had been moved to\nMedford. So much the worse. It could not be helped. There was nothing\nfor the doctor to do but to leave Bennett in ignorance and go ahead and\nfight for the life of Ferriss as best he could. Pitts arranged for a\nbrother physician to take over his practice, and devoted himself\nentirely to Ferriss. And Ferriss sickened and sickened, and went\nsteadily from bad to worse. The fever advanced regularly to a certain\nstage, a stage of imminent danger, and there paused. Rarely had Pitts\nbeen called upon to fight a more virulent form of the disease.\n\nWhat made matters worse was that Ferriss hung on for so long a time\nwithout change one way or another. Pitts had long since been convinced\nof ulceration in the membrane of the intestines, but it astonished him\nthat this symptom persisted so long without signs either of progressing\nor diminishing. The course of the disease was unusually slow. The first\nnurse had already had time to sicken and die; a second had been\ninfected, and yet Ferriss \"hung on,\" neither sinking nor improving, yet\nat every hour lying perilously near death. It was not often that death\nand life locked horns for so long, not often that the chance was so\neven. Many was the hour, many was the moment, when a hair would have\nturned the balance, and yet the balance was preserved.\n\nAt her abrupt recognition of Ferriss, in this patient whom she had been\nsummoned to nurse, and whose hold upon life was so pitifully weak,\nLloyd's heart gave a great leap and then sank ominously in her breast.\nHer first emotion was one of boundless self-reproach. Why had she not\nknown of this? Why had she not questioned Bennett more closely as to his\nfriend's sickness? Might she not have expected something like this? Was\nnot typhoid the one evil to be feared and foreseen after experiences\nsuch as Ferriss had undergone--the fatigue and privations of the march\nover the ice, and the subsequent months aboard the steam whaler, with\nits bad food, its dirt, and its inevitable overcrowding?\n\nAnd while she had been idling in the country, this man, whom she had\nknown since her girlhood better and longer than any of her few\nacquaintances, had been struck down, and day by day had weakened and\nsickened and wasted, until now, at any hour, at any moment, the life\nmight be snuffed out like the fight of a spent candle. What a miserable\nincompetent had she been! That day in the park when she had come upon\nhim, so weak and broken and far spent, why had she not, with all her\ntraining and experience, known that even then the flame was flickering\ndown to the socket, that a link in the silver chain was weakening? Now,\nperhaps, it was too late. But quick her original obstinacy rose up in\nprotest. No! she would not yield the life. No, no, no; again and a\nthousand times no! He belonged to her. Others she had saved, others far\nless dear to her than Ferriss. Her last patient--the little girl--she\nhad caught back from death at the eleventh hour, and of all men would\nshe not save Ferriss? In such sickness as this it was the nurse and not\nthe doctor who must be depended upon. And, once again, never so strong,\nnever so fine, never so glorious, her splendid independence, her pride\nin her own strength, her indomitable self-reliance leaped in her breast,\nleaped and stood firm, hard as tempered steel, head to the Enemy, daring\nthe assault, defiant, immovable, unshaken in its resolve, unconquerable\nin the steadfast tenacity of its purpose.\n\nThe story that Ferriss had told to Bennett, that uncalled-for and\ninexplicable falsehood, was a thing forgotten. Death stood at the\nbed-head, and in that room the little things of life had no place. The\nking was holding court, and the swarm of small, everyday issues, like a\ncrowd of petty courtiers, were not admitted to his presence. Ferriss'\nlife was in danger. Lloyd saw no more than that. At once she set about\nthe work.\n\nIn a few rapid sentences exchanged in low voices between her and the\ndoctor Lloyd made herself acquainted with the case.\n\n\"We've been using the ice-pack and wet-pack to bring down the\ntemperature in place of the cold bath,\" the doctor explained. \"I'm\nafraid of pericarditis.\"\n\n\"Quinine?\" inquired Lloyd.\n\n\"From twenty to forty grains in the morning and evening. Here's the\ntemperature chart for the last week. If we reach this point in axilla\nagain--\" he indicated one hundred and two degrees with a\nthumb-nail--\"we'll have to risk the cold bath, but only in that case.\"\n\n\"And the tympanites?\"\n\nDr. Pitts put his chin in the air.\n\n\"Grave--there's an intestinal ulcer, no doubt of it, and if it\nperforates--well, we can send for the undertaker then.\"\n\n\"Has he had hemorrhages?\"\n\n\"Two in the first week, but not profuse--he seemed to rally fairly well\nafterward. We have been injecting ether in case of anemia. Really, Miss\nSearight, the case is interesting, but wicked, wicked as original sin.\nKilled off my first nurse out of hand--good little boy, conscientious\nenough; took no care of himself; ate his meals in the sick-room against\nmy wishes; off he went--dicrotic pulse, diarrhea, vomiting, hospital,\nthrombosis of pulmonary artery, _pouf_, requiescat.\"\n\n\"And Miss Wakeley?\"\n\n\"Knocked under yesterday, and she was fairly saturated with creolin\nnight and morning. I don't know how it happened.... Well, God for us\nall. Here he is--that's the point for us.\" He glanced toward the bed,\nand for the third time Lloyd looked at the patient.\n\nFerriss was in a quiet delirium, and, at intervals, from behind his\nlips, dry and brown and fissured, there came the sounds of low and\nindistinct muttering. Barring a certain prominence of the cheek-bones,\nhis face was not very wasted, but its skin was a strange, dusky pallor.\nThe cold pack was about his head like a sort of caricatured crown.\n\n\"Well,\" repeated Pitts in a moment, \"I've been waiting for you to come\nto get a little rest. Was up all last night. Suppose you take over\ncharge.\"\n\nLloyd nodded her head, removing her hat and gloves, making herself\nready. Pitts gave her some final directions, and left her alone in the\nsick-room. For the moment there was nothing to do for the patient. Lloyd\nput on her hospital slippers and moved silently about the room,\npreparing for the night, and making some few changes in the matter of\nlight and ventilation. Then for a while the medicine occupied her\nattention, and she was at some pains to carefully sort out the\nantiseptic and disinfectants from the drugs themselves. These latter she\narranged on a table by themselves--studying the labels--assuring herself\nof their uses. Quinine for the regular morning and evening doses,\nsulphonal and trional for insomnia, ether for injections in case of\nanemia after hemorrhage, morphine for delirium, citrite of caffeine for\nweakness of the heart, tincture of valerian for the tympanites, bismuth\nto relieve nausea and vomiting, and the crushed ice wrapped in flannel\ncloths for the cold pack in the event of hyperpyrexia.\n\nLater in the evening she took the temperature in the armpit, noted the\ncondition of the pulse, and managed to get Ferriss--still in his quiet,\nmuttering delirium--to drink a glass of peptonised milk. She\nadministered the quinine, reading the label, as was her custom, three\ntimes, once as she took it up, again as she measured the dose, and a\nlast time as she returned the bottle to its place. Everything she did,\nevery minute change in Ferriss's condition, she entered upon a chart, so\nthat in the morning when Dr. Pitts should relieve her he could grasp the\nsituation at a glance.\n\nThe night passed without any but the expected variations of the pulse\nand temperature, though toward daylight Lloyd could fancy that Ferriss,\nfor a few moments, came out of his delirium and was conscious of his\nsurroundings. For a few seconds his eyes seemed to regain something of\ntheir intelligence, and his glance moved curiously about the room. But\nLloyd, sitting near the foot-board of the bed, turned her head from\nhim. It was not expedient that Ferriss should recognise her now.\n\nLloyd could not but commend the wisdom of bringing Ferriss to Dr.\nPitts's own house in so quiet a place as Medford. The doctor risked\nnothing. He was without a family, the only other occupants of the house\nbeing the housekeeper and cook. On more than one occasion, when an\ninteresting case needed constant watching, Pitts had used his house as a\nsanatorium. Quiet as the little village itself was, the house was\nremoved some little distance from its outskirts. The air was fine and\npure. The stillness, the calm, the unbroken repose, was almost\nSabbath-like. In the early watches of the night, just at the turn of the\ndawn, Lloyd heard the faint rumble of a passing train at the station\nnearly five miles away. For hours that and the prolonged stridulating of\nthe crickets were the only sounds. Then at last, while it was yet dark,\na faint chittering of waking birds began from under the eaves and from\nthe apple-trees in the yard about the house. Lloyd went to the window,\nand, drawing aside the curtains, stood there for a moment looking out.\nShe could see part of the road leading to the town, and, in the\ndistance, the edge of the town itself, a few well-kept country\nresidences of suburban dwellers of the City, and, farther on, a large,\nrectangular, brick building with cupola and flagstaff, perhaps the\npublic school or the bank or the Odd Fellows' Hall. Nearer by were\nfields and corners of pasture land, with here and there the formless\nshapes of drowsing cows. One of these, as Lloyd watched, changed\nposition, and she could almost hear the long, deep breath that\naccompanied the motion. Far off, miles upon miles, so it seemed, a\nrooster was crowing at exact intervals. All at once, and close at hand,\nanother answered--a gay, brisk carillon that woke the echoes in an\ninstant. For the first time Lloyd noticed a pale, dim belt of light low\nin the east.\n\nToward eight o'clock in the morning the doctor came to relieve her, and\nwhile he was examining the charts and she was making her report for the\nnight the housekeeper announced breakfast.\n\n\"Go down to your breakfast, Miss Searight,\" said the doctor. \"I'll stay\nhere the while. The housekeeper will show you to your room.\"\n\nBut before breakfasting Lloyd went to the room the housekeeper had set\napart for her--a different one than had been occupied by either of the\nprevious nurses--changed her dress, and bathed her face and hands in a\ndisinfecting solution. When she came out of her room the doctor met her\nin the hall; his hat and stick were in his hand. \"He has gone to sleep,\"\nhe informed her, \"and is resting quietly. I am going to get a mouthful\nof fresh air along the road. The housekeeper is with him. If he wakes\nshe'll call you. I will not be gone fifteen minutes. I've not been out\nof the house for five days, and there's no danger.\"\n\nBreakfast had been laid in what the doctor spoke of as the glass-room.\nThis was an enclosed veranda, one side being of glass and opening by\nFrench windows directly upon a little lawn that sloped away under the\napple-trees to the road. It was a charming apartment, an idea of a\nsister of Dr. Pitts, who at one time had spent two years at Medford.\nLloyd breakfasted here alone, and it was here that Bennett found her.\n\nThe one public carriage of Medford, a sort of four-seated carryall, that\nmet all the trains at the depot, had driven to the gate at the foot of\nthe yard, and had pulled up, the horses reeking and blowing. Even before\nit had stopped, a tall, square-shouldered man had alighted, but it was\nnot until he was half-way up the gravel walk that Lloyd had recognised\nhim. Bennett caught sight of her at the same moment, and strode swiftly\nacross the lawn and came into the breakfast-room by one of the open\nFrench windows. At once the room seemed to shrink in size; his first\nstep upon the floor--a step that was almost a stamp, so eager it was, so\nmasterful and resolute--set the panes of glass jarring in their frames.\nNever had Bennett seemed more out of place than in this almost dainty\nbreakfast-room, with its small, feminine appurtenances, its fragile\nglassware, its pots of flowers and growing plants. The incongruous\nsurroundings emphasized his every roughness, his every angularity.\nAgainst its background of delicate, mild tints his figure loomed\nsuddenly colossal; the great span of his chest and shoulders seemed\nnever so huge. His face; the great, brutal jaw, with its aggressive,\nbullying, forward thrust; the close-gripped lips, the contracted\nforehead, the small eyes, marred with the sharply defined cast, appeared\nnever so harsh, never so massive, never so significant of the\nresistless, crude force of the man, his energy, his overpowering\ndetermination. As he towered there before her, one hand gripped upon a\nchair-back, it seemed to her that the hand had but to close to crush the\nlittle varnished woodwork to a splinter, and when he spoke Lloyd could\nimagine that the fine, frail china of the table vibrated to the\ndeep-pitched bass of his voice.\n\nLloyd had only to look at him once to know that Bennett was at the\nmoment aroused and agitated to an extraordinary degree. His face was\ncongested and flaming. Under his frown his eyes seemed flashing\nveritable sparks; his teeth were set; in his temple a vein stood\nprominent and throbbing. But Lloyd was not surprised. Bennett had, no\ndoubt, heard of Ferriss's desperate illness. Small wonder he was excited\nwhen the life of his dearest friend was threatened. Lloyd could ignore\nher own quarrel with Bennett at such a moment.\n\n\"I am so sorry,\" she began, \"that you could not have known sooner. But\nyou remember you left no address. There was--\"\n\n\"What are you doing here?\" he broke in abruptly. \"What is the\nuse--why--\" he paused for a moment to steady his voice--\"you can't stay\nhere,\" he went on. \"Don't you know the risk you are running? You can't\nstay here another moment.\"\n\n\"That,\" answered Lloyd, smiling, \"is a matter that is interesting\nchiefly to me. I suppose you know that, Mr. Bennett.\"\n\n\"I know that you are risking your life and--\"\n\n\"And that, too, is my affair.\"\n\n\"I have made it mine,\" he responded quickly. \"Oh,\" he exclaimed sharply,\nstriking the back of the chair with his open palm, \"why must we always\nbe at cross-purposes with each other? I'm not good at talking. What is\nthe use of tangling ourselves with phrases? I love you, and I've come\nout here to ask you, to beg you, you understand, to leave this house,\nwhere you are foolishly risking your life. You must do it,\" he went on\nrapidly. \"I love you too well. Your life is too much to me to allow you\nto hazard it senselessly, foolishly. There are other women, other\nnurses, who can take your place. But you are not going to stay here.\"\n\nLloyd felt her indignation rising.\n\n\"This is my profession,\" she answered, trying to keep back her anger. \"I\nam here because it is my duty to be here.\" Then suddenly, as his\nextraordinary effrontery dawned upon her, she exclaimed, rising to her\nfeet: \"Do I need to explain to you what I do? I am here because I choose\nto be here. That is enough. I don't care to go any further with such a\ndiscussion as this.\"\n\n\"You will not leave here, then?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\nBennett hesitated an instant, searching for his words, then:\n\n\"I do not know how to ask favours. I've had little experience in that\nsort of thing. You must know how hard it is for me, and you must\nunderstand to what lengths I am driven then, when I entreat you, when I\nbeg of you, as humbly as it is possible for me to do so, to leave this\nhouse, now--at once. There is a train to the City within the hour; some\none else can take your place before noon. We can telegraph; will you\ngo?\"\n\n\"You are absurd.\"\n\n\"Lloyd, can't you see; don't you understand? It's as though I saw you\nrushing toward a precipice with your eyes shut.\"\n\n\"My place is here. I shall not leave.\"\n\nBut Bennett's next move surprised her. His eagerness, his agitation left\nhim upon the instant He took out his watch.\n\n\"I was wrong,\" he said quietly. \"The next train will not go for an hour\nand a quarter. There is more time than I supposed.\" Then, with as much\ngentleness as he could command, he added: \"Lloyd, you are going to take\nthat train?\"\n\n\"Now, you are becoming a little more than absurd,\" she answered. \"I\ndon't know, Mr. Bennett, whether or not you intend to be offensive, but\nI think you are succeeding rather well. You came to this house\nuninvited; you invade a gentleman's private residence, and you attempt\nto meddle and to interfere with me in the practice of my profession. If\nyou think you can impress me with heroics and declamation, please\ncorrect yourself at once. You have only succeeded in making yourself a\nlittle vulgar.\"\n\n\"That may be true or not,\" he answered with an indifferent movement of\nhis shoulders. \"It is all one to me. I have made up my mind that you\nshall leave this house this morning, and believe me, Miss Searight, I\nshall carry my point.\"\n\nFor the moment Lloyd caught her breath. For the moment she saw clearly\nwith just what sort of man she had to deal. There was a conviction in\nhis manner--now that he had quieted himself--that suddenly appeared\nunanswerable. It was like the slow, still moving of a piston.\n\nBut the next moment her own character reasserted itself. She remembered\nwhat she was herself. If he was determined, she was obstinate; if he was\nresolved, she was stubborn; if he was powerful, she was unyielding.\nNever had she conceded her point before; never had she allowed herself\nto be thwarted in the pursuance of a course she believed to be right.\nWas she, of all women, to yield now? The consciousness of her own power\nof resistance came suddenly to her aid. Bennett was strong, but was she\nnot strong herself? Where under the blue sky was the power that could\nbreak down her will? When death itself could not prevail against her,\nwhat in life could shake her resolution?\n\nSuddenly the tremendous import of the moment, the magnitude of the\nsituation, flashed upon Lloyd. Both of them had staked everything upon\nthis issue. Two characters of extraordinary power clashed violently\ntogether. There was to be no compromise, no half-measures. Either she or\nBennett must in the end be beaten. One of them was to be broken and\nhumbled beyond all retrieving. There in that commonplace little room,\nwith its trivial accessories, its inadequate background, a battle royal\nswiftly prepared itself. With the abruptness of an explosion the crisis\ndeveloped.\n\n\"Do I need to tell you,\" remarked Bennett, \"that your life is rather\nmore to me than any other consideration in the world? Do you suppose\nwhen the lives of every member of my command depended upon me I was any\nless resolved to succeed than I am now? I succeeded then, and I shall\nsucceed now, now when there is much more at stake. I am not accustomed\nto failure, and I shall not fail now. I assure you that I shall stop at\nnothing.\"\n\nIt was beyond Lloyd to retain her calmness under such aggression. It\nseemed as though her self-respect demanded that she should lose her\ntemper.\n\n\"And you think you can drive me as you drove your deck-hands?\" she\nexclaimed. \"What have you to do with me? Am I your subordinate? Do you\nthink you can bully me? We are not in Kolyuchin Bay, Mr. Bennett.\"\n\n\"You're the woman I love,\" he answered with an abrupt return of\nvehemence, \"and, by God! I shall stop at nothing to save your life.\"\n\n\"And my love for you, that you pretend is so much to you, I suppose that\nthis is the means you take to awaken it. Admitting, for the moment, that\nyou could induce me to shirk my duty, how should I love you for it? Ask\nyourself that.\"\n\nBut Bennett had but one answer to all her words. He struck his fist into\nthe palm of his hand as he answered:\n\n\"Your life is more to me than any other consideration.\"\n\n\"But my life--how do you know it is a question of my life? Come, if we\nare to quarrel, let us quarrel upon reasonable grounds. It does not\nfollow that I risk my life by staying--\"\n\n\"Leave the house first; we can talk of that afterward.\"\n\n\"I have allowed you to talk too much already,\" she exclaimed angrily.\n\"Let us come to the bottom of things at once. I will not be influenced\nnor cajoled nor bullied into leaving my post. Now, do you understand?\nThat is my final answer. You who were a commander, who were a leader of\nmen, what would you have done if one of your party had left his post at\na time of danger? I can tell you what you would have done--you would\nhave shot him, after first disgracing him, and now you would disgrace\nme. Is it reasonable? Is it consistent?\"\n\nBennett snapped his fingers.\n\n\"That for consistency!\"\n\n\"And you would be willing to disgrace me--to have me disgrace myself?\"\n\n\"Your life--\" began Bennett again.\n\nBut suddenly Lloyd flashed out upon him with: \"My life! My life! Are\nthere not some things better than life? You, above all men, should\nunderstand that much. Oh, be yourself, be the man I thought you were.\nYou have your code; let me have mine. You could not be what you are, you\ncould not have done what you did, if you had not set so many things\nabove merely your life. Admit that you could not have loved me unless\nyou believed that I could do the same. How could you still love me if\nyou knew I had failed in my duty? How could you still love me if you\nknew that you had broken down my will? I know you better than you know\nyourself. You loved me because you knew me to be strong and brave and to\nbe above petty deceptions and shams and subterfuges. And now you ask me\nto fail, to give up, to shirk, and you tell me you do so because you\nlove me.\"\n\n\"That is all so many words to me. I cannot argue with you, and there is\nno time for it. I did not come here to--converse.\"\n\nNever in her life before had Lloyd been so angry as at that moment. The\nsombre crimson of her cheeks had suddenly given place to an unwonted\npaleness; even her dull-blue eyes, that so rarely sparkled, were all\nalight. She straightened herself.\n\n\"Very well, then,\" she answered quietly, \"our conversation can stop\nwhere it is. You will excuse me, Mr. Bennett, if I leave you. I have my\nwork to do.\"\n\nBennett was standing between her and the door. He did not move. Very\ngravely he said:\n\n\"Don't. Please don't bring it--to that.\"\n\nLloyd flashed a look at him, her eyes wide, exclaiming:\n\n\"You don't mean--you don't dare--\"\n\n\"I tell you again that I mean to carry my point.\"\n\n\"And I tell you that I shall _not_ leave my patient.\"\n\nBennett met her glance for an instant, and, holding her gaze with his,\nanswered but two words. Speaking in a low voice and with measured\nslowness, he said:\n\n\"You--shall.\"\n\nThere was a silence. The two stood there, looking straight into one\nanother's eyes, their mutual opposition at its climax. The seconds began\nto pass. The conflict between the man's aggression and the woman's\nresistance reached its turning point. Before another word should be\nspoken, before the minute should pass, one of the two must give ground.\n\nAnd then it was that Lloyd felt something breakdown within her,\nsomething to which she could not put a name. A mysterious element of her\ncharacter, hitherto rigid and intact, was beginning at last to crumble.\nSomewhere a breach had been opened; somewhere the barrier had been\nundermined. The fine steadfastness that was hers, and that she had so\ndearly prized, her strength in which she had gloried, her independence,\nher splendid arrogant self-confidence and conscious power seemed all at\nonce to weaken before this iron resolve that shut its ears and eyes,\nthis colossal, untutored, savage intensity of purpose.\n\nAnd abruptly her eyes were opened, and the inherent weakness of her sex\nbecame apparent to her. Was it a mistake, then? Could not a woman be\nstrong? Was her strength grafted upon elemental weakness--not her\nindividual weakness, but the weakness of her sex, the intended natural\nweakness of the woman? Had she built her fancied impregnable fortress\nupon sand?\n\nBut habit was too strong. For an instant, brief as the opening and\nshutting of an eye, a vision was vouchsafed to her, one of those swift\nglimpses into unplumbed depths that come sometimes to the human mind in\nthe moments of its exaltation, but that are gone with such rapidity that\nthey may not be trusted. For an instant Lloyd saw deep down into the\nblack, mysterious gulf of sex--down, down, down where, immeasurably\nbelow the world of little things, the changeless, dreadful machinery of\nLife itself worked, clashing and resistless in its grooves. It was a\nglimpse fortunately brief, a vision that does not come too often, lest\nreason, brought to the edge of the abyss, grow giddy at the sight and,\nreeling, topple headlong. But quick the vision passed, the gulf closed,\nand she felt the firm ground again beneath her feet.\n\n\"I shall not,\" she cried.\n\nWas it the same woman who had spoken but one moment before? Did her\nvoice ring with the same undaunted defiance? Was there not a note of\ndespair in her tones, a barely perceptible quaver, the symbol of her\nwavering resolve? Was not the very fact that she must question her\nstrength proof positive that her strength was waning?\n\nBut her courage was unshaken, even if her strength was breaking. To the\nlast she would strive, to the end she would hold her forehead high. Not\ntill the last hope had been tried would she acknowledge her defeat.\n\n\"But in any case,\" she said, \"risk is better than certainty. If I risk\nmy life by staying, it is certain that he will die if I leave him at\nthis critical moment.\"\n\n\"So much the worse, then--you cannot stay.\"\n\nLloyd stared at him in amazement.\n\n\"It isn't possible; I don't believe you can understand. Do you know how\nsick he is? Do you know that he is lying at the point of death at this\nvery moment, and that the longer I stay away from him the more his life\nis in peril? Has he not rights as well as I; has he not a right to live?\nIt is not only my own humiliation that is at stake, it is the life of\nyour dearest friend, the man who stood by you, and helped you, and who\nsuffered the same hardships and privations as yourself.\"\n\n\"What's that?\" demanded Bennett with a sudden frown.\n\n\"If I leave Mr. Ferriss now, if he is left alone here for so much as\nhalf an hour, I will not answer--\"\n\n\"Ferriss! What are you talking about? What is your patient's name?\"\n\n\"Didn't you know?\"\n\n\"Ferriss! Dick Ferriss! Don't tell me it's Dick Ferriss.\"\n\n\"I thought all the time you knew--that you had heard. Yes, it is Mr.\nFerriss.\"\n\n\"Is he very sick? What is he doing out here? No, I had not heard; nobody\ntold me. Pitts was to write--to--to wire. Will he pull through? What's\nthe matter with him? Is it he who had typhoid?\"\n\n\"He is very dangerously ill. Dr. Pitts brought him here. This is his\nhouse. We do not know if he will get well. It is only by watching him\nevery instant that we can hope for anything. At this moment there is no\none with him but a servant. _Now_, Mr. Bennett, am I to go to my\npatient?\"\n\n\"But--but--we can get some one else.\"\n\n\"Not before three hours, and it's only the truth when I tell you he may\ndie at any minute. Am I to go?\"\n\nIn a second of time the hideous situation leaped up before Bennett's\neyes. Right or wrong, the conviction that Lloyd was terribly imperilling\nher life by remaining at her patient's bedside had sunk into his mind\nand was not to be eradicated. It was a terror that had gripped him close\nand that could not be reasoned away. But Ferriss? What of him? Now it\nhad brusquely transpired that his life, too, hung in the balance. How to\ndecide? How to meet this abominable complication wherein he must\nsacrifice the woman he so dearly loved or the man who was the Damon to\nhis Pythias, the Jonathan to his David?\n\n\"Am I to go?\" repeated Lloyd for the third time.\n\nBennett closed his eyes, clasping his head with both hands.\n\n\"Great God, wait--wait--I can't think--I--I, oh, this is terrible!\"\n\nLloyd drove home her advantage mercilessly.\n\n\"Wait? I tell you we can't wait.\"\n\nThen Bennett realised with a great spasm of horror that for him there\nwas no going back. All his life, accustomed to quick decisions in\nmoments of supreme peril, he took his decision now, facing, with such\ncourage as he could muster, its unspeakable consequences, consequences\nthat he knew must harry and hound him all the rest of his life.\nWhichever way he decided, he opened his heart to the beak and talons of\na pitiless remorse. He could no longer see, in the dreadful confusion of\nhis mind, the right of things or the wrong of things, could not\naccurately weigh chances or possibilities. For him only two alternatives\npresented themselves, the death of Ferriss or the death of Lloyd. He\ncould see no compromise, could imagine no escape. It was as though a\nheadsman with ready axe stood at his elbow, awaiting his commands. And,\nbesides all this, he had long since passed the limit--though perhaps he\ndid not know it himself--where he could see anything but the point he\nhad determined to gain, the goal he had determined to reach. His mind\nwas made up. His furious energy, his resolve to conquer at all costs,\nhad become at last a sort of directed frenzy. The engine he had set in\nmotion was now beyond his control. He could not now--whether he would or\nno--reverse its action, swerve it from its iron path, call it back from\nthe monstrous catastrophe toward which it was speeding him.\n\n\"God help us all!\" he muttered.\n\n\"Well,\" said Lloyd expectantly.\n\nBennett drew a deep breath, his hands falling helplessly at his sides.\nIn a way he appeared suddenly bowed; the great frame of bone and sinew\nseemed in some strange, indefinable manner to shrink, to stagger under\nthe sudden assumption of an intolerable burden--a burden that was never\nto be lifted.\n\nEven then, however, Bennett still believed in the wisdom of his course,\nstill believed himself to be right. But, right or wrong, he now must go\nforward. Was it fate, was it doom, was it destiny?\n\nBennett's entire life had been spent in the working out of great ideas\nin the face of great obstacles; continually he had been called upon to\novercome enormous difficulties with enormous strength. For long periods\nof time he had been isolated from civilisation, had been face to face\nwith the simple, crude forces of an elemental world--forces that were to\nbe combated and overthrown by means no less simple and crude than\nthemselves. He had lost the faculty, possessed, no doubt, by smaller\nminds, of dealing with complicated situations. To resort to expedients,\nto make concessions, was all beyond him. For him a thing was absolutely\nright or absolutely wrong, and between the two there was no gradation.\nFor so long a time had he looked at the larger, broader situations of\nlife that his mental vision had become all deformed and confused. He saw\nthings invariably magnified beyond all proportion, or else dwarfed to a\nlittleness that was beneath consideration. Normal vision was denied him.\nIt was as though he studied the world through one or the other ends of a\ntelescope, and when, as at present, his emotions were aroused, matters\nwere only made the worse. The idea that Ferriss might recover, though\nLloyd should leave him at this moment, hardly presented itself to his\nmind. He was convinced that if Lloyd went away Ferriss would die; Lloyd\nhad said as much herself. The hope that Lloyd might, after all, nurse\nhim through his sickness without danger to herself was so remote that he\ndid not consider it for one instant. If Lloyd remained she, like the\nother nurse, would contract the disease and die.\n\nThese were the half-way measures Bennett did not understand, the\nexpedients he could no longer see. It was either Lloyd or Ferriss. He\nmust choose between them.\n\nBennett went to the door of the room, closed it and leaned against it.\n\n\"No,\" he said.\n\nLloyd was stricken speechless. For the instant she shrank before him as\nif from a murderer. Bennett now knew precisely the terrible danger in\nwhich he left the man who was his dearest friend. Would he actually\nconsent to his death? It was almost beyond belief, and for the moment\nLloyd herself quailed before him. Her first thoughts were not of\nherself, but of Ferriss. If he was Bennett's friend he was her friend\ntoo. At that very moment he might be dying for want of her care. She was\nfast becoming desperate. For the moment she could put all thought of\nherself and of her own dignity in the background.\n\n\"What is it you want?\" she cried. \"Is it my humiliation you ask? Well,\nthen, you have it. It is as hard for me to ask favours as it is for you.\nI am as proud as you, but I entreat you, you hear me, as humbly as I\ncan, to let me go. What do you want more than that? Oh, can't you\nunderstand? While we talk here, while you keep me here, he may be dying.\nIs it a time for arguments, is it a time for misunderstandings, is it a\ntime to think of ourselves, of our own lives, our own little affairs?\"\nShe clasped her hands. \"Will you please--can I, can I say more than\nthat; will you please let me go?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\nWith a great effort Lloyd tried to regain her self-control. She paused a\nmoment, then:\n\n\"Listen!\" she said. \"You say that you love me; that I am more to you\nthan even Mr. Ferriss, your truest friend. I do not wish to think of\nmyself at such a time as this, but supposing that you should make\nme--that I should consent to leave my patient. Think of me then,\nafterward. Can I go back there to the house, the house that I built? Can\nI face the women of my profession? What would they think of me? What\nwould my friends think of me--I who have held my head so high? You will\nruin my life. I should have to give up my profession. Oh, can't you see\nin what position you would place me?\" Suddenly the tears sprang to her\neyes. \"No!\" she cried vehemently. \"No, no, no, I will not, I will not be\ndisgraced!\"\n\n\"I have no wish to disgrace you,\" answered Bennett. \"It is strange for\nyou to say that to me, if I love you so well that I can give up Ferriss\nfor--\"\n\n\"Then, if you love me so much as that, there must be one thing that you\nwould set even above my life. Do you wish to make me hate you?\"\n\n\"There is nothing in the world more to me than your life; you know that.\nHow can you think it of me?\"\n\n\"Because you don't understand--because you don't know that--oh, that I\nlove you! I--no--I didn't mean--I didn't mean--\"\n\nWhat had she said? What had happened? How was it that the words that\nyesterday she would have been ashamed to so much as whisper to herself\nhad now rushed to her lips almost of their own accord? After all those\nyears of repression, suddenly the sweet, dim thought she had hidden in\nher secretest heart's heart had leaped to light and to articulate words.\nUnasked, unbidden, she had told him that she loved him. She, she had\ndone this thing when, but a few moments before, her anger against him\nhad shaken her to her very finger-tips. The hot, intolerable shame of it\nsmote like fire into her face. Her world was cracking about her ears;\neverything she had prized the dearest was being torn from her,\neverything she had fancied the strongest was being overthrown. Had she,\nshe who had held herself so proud and high, come at last to this?\n\nSwiftly she turned from him and clasped her hands before her eyes and\nsank down into the chair she had quitted, bowing her head upon her arms,\nhiding her face, shutting herself from the light of day, quivering and\nthrilling with an agony of shame and with an utter, an abject\nself-contempt that was beyond all power of expression. But the instant\nshe felt Bennett's touch upon her shoulder she sprang up as if a knife\nhad pierced her, and shrank from him, turning her head away, her hand,\npalm outward, before her eyes.\n\n\"Oh, please!\" she begged piteously, almost inarticulately in the stress\nof her emotion, \"don't--if you are a man--don't take advantage--please,\nplease don't touch me. Let me go away.\"\n\nShe was talking to deaf ears. In two steps Bennett had reached her side\nand had taken her in his arms. Lloyd could not resist. Her vigour of\nbody as well as of mind was crushed and broken and beaten down; and why\nwas it that in spite of her shame, that in spite of her unutterable\nself-reproach, the very touch of her cheek upon his shoulder was a\ncomfort? Why was it that to feel herself carried away in the rush of\nthis harsh, impetuous, masculine power was a happiness? Why was it that\nto know that her prided fortitude and hitherto unshaken power were being\noverwhelmed and broken with a brutal, ruthless strength was an\nexultation and a glory? Why was it that she who but a moment before\nquailed from his lightest touch now put her arms about his neck and\nclung to him with a sense of protection and of refuge, the need of which\nshe had always and until that very moment disdained?\n\n\"Why should you be sorry because you spoke?\" said Bennett. \"I knew that\nyou loved me and you knew that I loved you. What does it matter if you\nsaid it or did not say it? We know each other, you and I. We understand.\nYou knew that I loved you. You think that I have been strong and\ndetermined, and have done the things I set out to do; what I am is what\nyou made me. What I have done I have done because I thought you would\napprove. Do you think I would have come back if I had not known that I\nwas coming back to you?\" Suddenly an impatient exclamation escaped him,\nand his clasp about her tightened. \"Oh! words--the mere things that one\ncan _say_, seem so pitiful, so miserably inadequate. Don't you know,\ncan't you feel what you are to me? Tell me, do you think I love you?\"\n\nBut she could not bear to meet his glance just yet. Her eyes were\nclosed, and she could only nod her head.\n\nBut Bennett took her head in both his hands and turned her face to his.\nEven yet she kept her eyes closed.\n\n\"Lloyd,\" he said, and his voice was almost a command; \"Lloyd, look at\nme. Do you love me?\"\n\nShe drew a deep breath. Then her sweet dull-blue eyes opened, and\nthrough the tears that brimmed them and wet her lashes she looked at him\nand met his glance fearlessly and almost proudly, and her voice trembled\nand vibrated with an infinite tenderness as she answered:\n\n\"I do love you, Ward; love you with all my heart.\"\n\nThen, after a pause, she said, drawing a little from him and resting a\nhand upon either shoulder:\n\n\"But listen, dear; we must not think of ourselves now. We must think of\nhim, so sick and weak and helpless. This is a terrible moment in our\nlives. I don't know why it has come to us. I don't know why it should\nall have happened as it has this morning. Just a few moments ago I was\nangry as I never was in my life before--and at you--and now it seems to\nme that I never was so happy; I don't know myself any more. Everything\nis confused; all we can do is to hold to what we know is right and trust\nthat everything will be well in the end. It is a crisis, isn't it? And\nall our lives and all our happiness depend upon how we meet it. I am all\ndifferent now. I am not the woman I was a half-hour ago. You must be\nbrave for me now, and you must be strong for me and help me to do my\nduty. We must live up to the best that is in us and do what we think is\nright, no matter what risks we run, no matter what the consequences are.\nI would not have asked you to help me before--before what has\nhappened--but now I need your help. You have said I helped you to be\nbrave; help me to be brave now, and to do what I know is right.\"\n\nBut Bennett was still blind. If she had been dear to him before, how\ndoubly so had she become since she had confessed her love for him!\nFerriss was forgotten, ignored. He could not let her go, he could not\nlet her run the slightest risk. Was he to take any chance of losing her\nnow? He shook his head.\n\n\"Ward!\" she exclaimed with deep and serious earnestness. \"If you do not\nwish me to risk my life by going to my post, be careful, oh, be very\ncareful, that you do not risk something that is more to us both than\nlife itself, by keeping me from it. Do you think I could love you so\ndeeply and so truly as I do if I had not kept my standards high; if I\nhad not believed in the things that were better than life, and stronger\nthan death, and dearer to me than even love itself? There are some\nthings I cannot do: I cannot be false, I cannot be cowardly, I cannot\nshirk my duty. Now I am helpless in your hands. You have conquered, and\nyou can do with me as you choose. But if you make me do what is false,\nand what is cowardly, and what is dishonourable; if you stand between me\nand what I know is my duty, how can I love you, how can I love you?\"\n\nPersistently, perversely, Bennett stopped his ears to every\nconsideration, to every argument. She wished to hazard her life. That\nwas all he understood.\n\n\"No, Lloyd,\" he answered, \"you must not do it.\"\n\n\"--and I want to love you,\" she went on, as though she had not heard. \"I\nwant you to be everything to me. I have trusted you so long--had faith\nin you so long, I don't want to think of you as the man who failed me\nwhen I most needed his help, who made me do the thing that was\ncontemptible and unworthy. Believe me,\" she went on with sudden energy,\n\"you will kill my love for you if you persist.\"\n\nBut before Bennett could answer there was a cry.\n\n\"It is the servant,\" exclaimed Lloyd quickly. \"She has been\nwatching--there in the room with him.\"\n\n\"Nurse--Miss Searight,\" came the cry, \"quick--there is something\nwrong--I don't know--oh, hurry!\"\n\n\"Do you hear?\" cried Lloyd. \"It is the crisis--he may be dying. Oh,\nWard, it is the man you love! We can save him.\" She stamped her foot in\nthe frenzy of her emotion, her hands twisting together. \"I _will_ go. I\nforbid you to keep--to hinder--to--to, oh, what is to become of us? If\nyou love me, if you love him--_Ward, will you let me go?_\"\n\nBennett put his hands over his ears, his eyes closed. In the horror of\nthat moment, when he realised that no matter how he might desire it he\ncould not waver in his resolution, it seemed to him that his reason must\ngive way. But he set his back to the door, his hand gripped tight upon\nthe knob, and through his set teeth his answer came as before:\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Nurse--Miss Searight, where are you? Hurry, oh, hurry!\"\n\n\"Will you let me go?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\nLloyd caught at his hand, shut so desperately upon the knob, striving to\nloosen his clasp. She hardly knew what she was doing; she threw her arms\nabout his neck, imploring, commanding, now submissive, now imperious,\nher voice now vibrating with anger, now trembling with passionate\nentreaty.\n\n\"You are not only killing him, you are killing my love for you; will you\nlet me go--the love that is so dear to me? Let me love you, Ward; listen\nto me; don't make me hate you; let me love you, dear--\"\n\n\"Hurry, oh, hurry!\"\n\n\"Let me love you; let him live. I want to love you. It's the best\nhappiness in my life. Let me be happy. Can't you see what this moment is\nto mean for us? It is our happiness or wretchedness forever. Will you\nlet me go?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"For the last time, Ward, listen! It is my love for you and his life.\nDon't crush us both--yes, and yourself. You who can, who are so\npowerful, don't trample all our happiness under foot.\"\n\n\"Hurry, hurry; oh, will nobody come to help?\"\n\n\"Will you let me go?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\nHer strength seemed all at once to leave her. All the fabric of her\ncharacter, so mercilessly assaulted, appeared in that moment to reel,\ntopple, and go crashing to its wreck. She was shattered, broken,\nhumbled, and beaten down to the dust. Her pride was gone, her faith in\nherself was gone, her fine, strong energy was gone. The pity of it, the\ngrief of it; all that she held dearest; her fine and confident\nsteadfastness; the great love that had brought such happiness into her\nlife--that had been her inspiration, all torn from her and tossed aside\nlike chaff. And her patient--Ferriss, the man who loved her, who had\nundergone such suffering, such hardship, who trusted her and whom it was\nher duty to nurse back to life and health--if he should perish for want\nof her care, then what infinite sorrow, then what endless remorse, then\nwhat long agony of unavailing regret! Her world, her universe grew dark\nto her; she was driven from her firm stand. She was lost, she was\nwhirled away--away with the storm, landmarks obliterated, lights gone;\naway with the storm; out into the darkness, out into the void, out into\nthe waste places and wilderness and trackless desolation.\n\n\"Hurry, oh, hurry!\"\n\nIt was too late. She had failed; the mistake had been made, the question\nhad been decided. That insensate, bestial determination, iron-hearted,\niron-strong, had beaten down opposition, had carried its point. Life and\nlove had been crushed beneath its trampling without pity, without\nhesitation. The tragedy of the hour was done; the tragedy of the long\nyears to come was just beginning.\n\nLloyd sank down in the chair before the table, and the head that she had\nheld so high bowed down upon her folded arms. The violence of her grief\nshook her from head to foot like a dry, light reed. Her heart seemed\nliterally to be breaking. She must set her teeth with all her strength\nto keep from groaning aloud, from crying out in her hopeless sorrow her\nimpotent shame and despair.\n\nOnce more came the cry for help. Then the house fell silent. The minutes\npassed. But for Lloyd's stifled grief there was no sound.\nBennett--leaning heavily against the door, his great shoulders stooping\nand bent, his face ashen, his eyes fixed--did not move. He did not speak\nto Lloyd. There was no word of comfort he could address to her--that\nwould have seemed the last mockery. He had prevailed, as he knew he\nshould, as he knew he must, when once his resolve was taken. The force\nthat, once it was unleashed, was beyond him to control, had accomplished\nits purpose. His will remained unbroken; but at what cost? However, that\nwas for future consideration. The costs? Had he not his whole life\nbefore him in which to count them? The present moment still called upon\nhim to act. He looked at his watch.\n\nThe next quarter of an hour was all a confusion to him. Its incidents\nrefused to define themselves upon his memory when afterward he tried to\nrecall them. He could remember, however, that when he helped Lloyd into\nthe carryall that was to take her to the depot in the village she had\nshrunk from his touch and had drawn away from him as if from a\ncriminal--a murderer. He placed her satchel on the front seat with the\ndriver, and got up beside the driver himself. She had drawn her veil\nover her face, and during the drive sat silent and motionless.\n\n\"Can you make it?\" asked Bennett of the driver, watch in hand. The time\nwas of the shortest, but the driver put the whip to his horses and, at a\nrun, they reached the railway station a few moments ahead of time.\nBennett told the driver to wait, and while Lloyd remained in her place\nhe bought her ticket for the City. Then he went to the telegraph office\nand sent a peremptory despatch to the house on Calumet Square.\n\nA few moments later the train had come and gone, an abrupt eruption of\nroaring iron and shrieking steam. Bennett was left on the platform\nalone, watching it lessen to a smoky blur where the rails converged\ntoward the horizon. For an instant he stood watching, watching a\nresistless, iron-hearted force whirling her away, out of his reach, out\nof his life. Then he shook himself, turning sharply about.\n\n\"Back to the doctor's house, now,\" he commanded the driver; \"on the run,\nyou understand.\"\n\nBut the other protested. His horses were all but exhausted. Twice they\nhad covered that distance at top speed and under the whip. He refused to\nreturn. Bennett took the young man by the arm and lifted him from his\nseat to the ground. Then he sprang to his place and lashed the horses to\na gallop.\n\nWhen he arrived at Dr. Pitts's house he did not stop to tie the horses,\nbut threw the reins over their backs and entered the front hall, out of\nbreath and panting. But the doctor, during Bennett's absence, had\nreturned, and it was he who met him half-way up the stairs.\n\n\"How is he?\" demanded Bennett. \"I have sent for another nurse; she will\nbe out here on the next train. I wired from the station.\"\n\n\"The only objection to that,\" answered the doctor, looking fixedly at\nhim, \"is that it is not necessary. Mr. Ferriss has just died.\"\n\n\n\n\nVII.\n\n\nThroughout her ride from Medford to the City it was impossible for\nLloyd, so great was the confusion in her mind, to think connectedly. She\nhad been so fiercely shocked, so violently shattered and weakened, that\nfor a time she lacked the power and even the desire to collect and to\nconcentrate her scattering thoughts. For the time being she felt, but\nonly dimly, that a great blow had fallen, that a great calamity had\noverwhelmed her, but so extraordinary was the condition of her mind that\nmore than once she found herself calmly awaiting the inevitable moment\nwhen the full extent of the catastrophe would burst upon her. For the\nmoment she was merely tired. She was willing even to put off this\nreaction for a while, willing to remain passive and dizzied and\nstupefied, resigning herself helplessly and supinely to the swift\ncurrent of events.\n\nYet while that part of her mind which registered the greater, deeper,\nand more lasting impressions remained inactive, the smaller faculty,\nthat took cognisance of the little, minute-to-minute matters, was as\nbusy and bright as ever. It appeared that the blow had been struck over\nthis latter faculty, and not, as one so often supposes, through it. She\nseemed in that hour to understand the reasonableness of this phenomenon,\nthat before had always appeared so inexplicable, and saw how great\nsorrow as well as great joy strikes only at the greater machinery of the\nbrain, overpassing and ignoring the little wheels and cogs, that work on\nas briskly as ever in storm or calm, being moved only by temporary and\ntrivial emotions and impressions.\n\nSo it was that for upward of an hour while the train carried her swiftly\nback to the City, Lloyd sat quietly in her place, watching the landscape\nrushing past her and cut into regular divisions by the telegraph poles\nlike the whirling pictures of a kinetoscope. She noted, and even with\nsome particularity, the other passengers--a young girl in a smart\ntailor-made gown reading a book, cutting the leaves raggedly with a\nhairpin; a well-groomed gentleman with a large stomach, who breathed\nloudly through his nose; the book agent with his oval boxes of dried\nfigs and endless thread of talk; a woman with a little boy who wore\nspectacles and who was continually making unsteady raids upon the\nwater-cooler, and the brakeman and train conductor laughing and chatting\nin the forward seat.\n\nShe took an interest in every unusual feature of the country through\nwhich the train was speeding, and noted each stop or increase of speed.\nShe found a certain diversion, as she had often done before, in watching\nfor the mile-posts and in keeping count of the miles. She even asked the\nconductor at what time the train would reach the City, and uttered a\nlittle murmur of vexation when she was told that it was a half-hour\nlate. The next instant she was asking herself why this delay should seem\nannoying to her. Then, toward the close of the afternoon, came the City\nitself. First a dull-gray smudge on the horizon, then a world of grimy\nstreets, rows of miserable tenements festooned with rags, then a tunnel\nor two, and at length the echoing glass-arched terminal of the station.\nLloyd alighted, and, remembering that the distance was short, walked\nsteadily toward her destination till the streets and neighbourhood\nbecame familiar. Suddenly she came into the square. Directly opposite\nwas the massive granite front of the agency. She paused abruptly. She\nwas returning to the house after abandoning her post. What was she to\nsay to them, the other women of her profession?\n\nThen all at once came the reaction. Instantly the larger machinery of\nthe mind resumed its functions, the hurt of the blow came back. With a\nfierce wrench of pain, the wound reopened, full consciousness returned.\nLloyd remembered then that she had proved false to her trust at a moment\nof danger, that Ferriss would probably die because of what she had done,\nthat her strength of will and of mind wherein she had gloried was broken\nbeyond redemption; that Bennett had failed her, that her love for him,\nthe one great happiness of her life, was dead and cold and could never\nbe revived, and that in the eyes of the world she stood dishonoured and\ndisgraced.\n\nNow she must enter that house, now she must face its inmates, her\ncompanions. What to say to them? How explain her defection? How tell\nthem that she had not left her post of her own will? Lloyd fancied\nherself saying in substance that the man who loved her and whom she\nloved had made her abandon her patient. She set her teeth. No, not that\nconfession of miserable weakness; not that of all things. And yet the\nother alternative, what was that? It could be only that she had been\nafraid--she, Lloyd Searight! Must she, who had been the bravest of them\nall, stand before that little band of devoted women in the light of a\nself-confessed coward?\n\nShe remembered the case of the young English woman, Harriet Freeze, who,\nwhen called upon to nurse a smallpox patient, had been found wanting in\ncourage at the crucial moment, and had discovered an excuse for leaving\nher post. Miss Freeze had been expelled dishonourably from the midst of\nher companions. And now she, Lloyd, standing apparently convicted of the\nsame dishonour, must face the same tribunal. There was no escape. She\nmust enter that house, she must endure that ordeal, and this at\nprecisely the time when her resolution had been shattered, her will\nbroken, her courage daunted. For a moment the idea of flight suggested\nitself to her--she would avoid the issue. She would hide from reproach\nand contumely, and without further explanation go back to her place in\nthe country at Bannister. But the little exigencies of her position made\nthis impossible. Besides her nurse's bag, her satchel was the only\nbaggage she had at that moment, and she knew that there was but little\nmoney in her purse.\n\nAll at once she realised that while debating the question she had been\nsitting on one of the benches under the trees in the square. The sun was\nsetting; evening was coming on. Maybe if she waited until six o'clock\nshe could enter the house while the other nurses were at supper, gain\nher room unobserved, then lock herself in and deny herself to all\ncallers. But Lloyd made a weary, resigned movement of her shoulders.\nSooner or later she must meet them all eye to eye. It would be only\nputting off the humiliation.\n\nShe rose, and, turning to the house, began to walk slowly toward it. Why\nput it off? It would be as hard at one time as another. But so great was\nher sense of shame that even as she walked she fancied that the very\npassers-by, the loungers on the benches around the fountain, must know\nthat here was a disgraced woman. Was it not apparent in her very face,\nin the very uncertainty of her gait? She told herself she had not done\nwisely to sit even for a moment upon the bench she had just quitted. She\nwondered if she had been observed, and furtively glanced about her.\nThere! Was not that nursemaid studying her too narrowly? And the\npoliceman close at hand, was he not watching her quizzically? She\nquickened her gait, moved with a sudden impulse to get out of sight, to\nhide within doors--where? In the house? There where, so soon as she set\nfoot in it, her companions, the other nurses, must know her dishonour?\nWhere was she to go? Where to turn? What was to become of her?\n\nBut she _must_ go to the house. It was inevitable. She went forward, as\nit were, step by step. That little journey across the square under the\nelms and cottonwoods was for her a veritable _chemin de la croix_. Every\nstep was an agony; every yard covered only brought her nearer the time\nand place of exposure. It was all the more humiliating because she knew\nthat her impelling motive was not one of duty. There was nothing lofty\nin the matter--nothing self-sacrificing. She went back because she had\nto go back. Little material necessities, almost ludicrous in their\npettiness, forced her on.\n\nAs she came nearer she looked cautiously at the windows of the agency.\nWho would be the first to note her home-coming? Would it be Miss\nDouglass, or Esther Thielman, or Miss Bergyn, the superintendent nurse?\nWhat would first be said to her? With what words would she respond? Then\nhow the news of the betrayal of her trust would flash from room to room!\nHow it would be discussed, how condemned, how deplored! Not one of the\nnurses of that little band but would not feel herself hurt by what she\nhad done--by what she had been forced to do. And the news of her failure\nwould spread to all her acquaintances and friends throughout the City.\nDr. Street would know it; every physician to whom she had hitherto been\nso welcome an aid would know it. In all the hospitals it would be a nine\ndays' gossip. Campbell would hear of it, and Hattie.\n\nAll at once, within thirty feet of the house, Lloyd turned about and\nwalked rapidly away from it. The movement was all but involuntary; every\ninstinct in her, every sense of shame, brusquely revolted. It was\nstronger than she. A power, for the moment irresistible, dragged her\nback from that doorway. Once entering here, she left all hope behind.\nYet the threshold must be crossed, yet the hope must be abandoned.\n\nShe felt that if she faced about now a second time she would indeed\nattract attention. So, while her cheeks flamed hot at the meanness, the\nmiserable ridiculousness of the imposture, she assumed a brisk,\ndetermined gait, as though she knew just where she were going, and,\nturning out of the square down a by-street, walked around the block,\neven stopping once or twice before a store, pretending an interest in\nthe display. It seemed to her that by now everybody in the streets must\nhave noted that there was something wrong with her. Twice as a passer-by\nbrushed past her she looked back to see if he was watching her. How to\nlive through the next ten minutes? If she were only in her room, bolted\nin, locked and double-locked in. Why was there not some back way through\nwhich she could creep to that seclusion?\n\nAnd so it was that Lloyd came back to the house she had built, to the\nlittle community she had so proudly organised, to the agency she had\nfounded, and with her own money endowed and supported.\n\nAt last she found herself at the bottom of the steps, her foot upon the\nlowest one, her hand clasping the heavy bronze rail. There was no going\nback now. She went up and pushed the button of the electric bell, and\nthen, the step once taken, the irrevocable once dared, something like\nthe calmness of resignation came to her. There was no help for it. Now\nfor the ordeal. Rownie opened the door for her with a cheery welcome.\nLloyd was dimly conscious that the girl said something about her mail,\nand that she was just in time for supper. But the hall and stairway were\ndeserted and empty, while from the dining-room came a subdued murmur of\nconversation and the clink of dishes. The nurses were at supper, as\nLloyd had hoped. The moment favoured her, and she brushed by Rownie, and\nalmost ran, panic-stricken and trembling, up the stairs.\n\nShe gained the hall of the second floor. There was the door of her room\nstanding ajar. With a little gasp of infinite relief, she hurried to it,\nentered, shut and locked and bolted it behind her, and, casting her\nsatchel and handbag from her, flung herself down upon the great couch,\nand buried her head deep among the cushions.\n\nAt Lloyd's abrupt entrance Miss Douglass turned about from the\nbook-shelves in an angle of the room and stared a moment in no little\nsurprise. Then she exclaimed:\n\n\"Why, Lloyd, why, what is it--what is the matter?\"\n\nLloyd sprang up sharply at the sound of her voice, and then sank down to\na sitting posture upon the edge of the couch. Quietly enough she said:\n\n\"Oh, is it you? I didn't know--expect to find any one--\"\n\n\"You don't mind, do you? I just ran in to get a book--something to read.\nI've had a headache all day, and didn't go down to supper.\"\n\nLloyd nodded. \"Of course--I don't mind,\" she said, a little wearily.\n\n\"But tell me,\" continued the fever nurse, \"whatever is the matter? When\nyou came in just now--I never saw you so--oh, I understand, your case at\nMedford--\"\n\nLloyd's hands closed tight upon the edge of the couch.\n\n\"No one could have got a patient through when the fever had got as far\nas that,\" continued the other. \"This must have been the fifth or sixth\nweek. The second telegram came just in time to prevent my going. I was\njust going out of the door when the boy came with it.\"\n\n\"You? What telegram?\" inquired Lloyd.\n\n\"Yes, I was on call. The first despatch asking for another extra nurse\ncame about two o'clock. The four-twenty was the first train I could have\ntaken--the two-forty-five express is a through train and don't stop at\nMedford--and, as I say, I was just going out of the door when Dr.\nPitts's second despatch came, countermanding the first, and telling us\nthat the patient had died. It seems that it was one of the officers of\nthe Freja expedition. We didn't know--\"\n\n\"Died?\" interrupted Lloyd, looking fixedly at her.\n\n\"But Lloyd, you mustn't take it so to heart. You couldn't have got him\nthrough. No one could at that time. He was probably dying when you were\nsent for. We must all lose a case now and then.\"\n\n\"Died?\" repeated Lloyd; \"Dr. Pitts wired that Mr. Ferriss died?\"\n\n\"Yes; it was to prevent my coming out there uselessly. He must have sent\nthe wire quite an hour before you left. It was very thoughtful of him.\"\n\n\"He's dead,\" said Lloyd in a low, expressionless voice, looking vacantly\nabout the room. \"Mr. Ferriss is dead.\" Then suddenly she put a fist to\neither temple, horror-struck and for the moment shaken with hysteria\nfrom head to foot, her eyes widening with an expression almost of\nterror. \"Dead!\" she cried. \"Oh, it's horrible! Why didn't I--why\ncouldn't I--\"\n\n\"I know just how you feel,\" answered Miss Douglass soothingly. \"I am\nthat way myself sometimes. It's not professional, I know, but when you\nhave been successful in two or three bad cases you think you can always\nwin; and then when you lose the next case you believe that somehow it\nmust have been your fault--that if you had been a little more careful at\njust that moment, or done a little different in that particular point,\nyou might have saved your patient. But you, of all people, ought not to\nfeel like that. If you could not have saved your case nobody could.\"\n\n\"It was just because I had the case that it was lost.\"\n\n\"Nonsense, Lloyd; don't talk like that. You've not had enough sleep;\nyour nerves have been over-strained. You're worn out and a little\nhysterical and morbid. Now lie down and keep quiet, and I'll bring you\nyour supper. You need a good night's sleep and bromide of potassium.\"\n\nWhen she had gone Lloyd rose to her feet and drew her hand wearily\nacross her eyes. The situation adjusted itself in her mind. After the\nfirst recoil of horror at Ferriss's death she was able to see the false\nposition in which she stood. She had been so certain already that\nFerriss would die, leaving him as she did at so critical a moment, that\nnow the sharpness of Miss Douglass's news was blunted a little. She had\nonly been unprepared for the suddenness of the shock. But now she\nunderstood clearly how Miss Douglass had been deceived by circumstances.\nThe fever nurse had heard of Ferriss's death early in the afternoon, and\nsupposed, of course, that Lloyd had left the case _after_, and not\nbefore, it had occurred. This was the story the other nurses would\nbelieve. Instantly, in the flood of grief and remorse and humiliation\nthat had overwhelmed her, Lloyd caught at this straw of hope. Only Dr.\nPitts and Bennett knew the real facts. Bennett, of course, would not\nspeak, and Lloyd knew that the physician would understand the cruelty\nand injustice of her situation, and because of that would also keep\nsilence. To make sure of this she could write him a letter, or, better\nstill, see him personally. It would be hard to tell him the truth. But\nthat was nothing when compared with the world's denunciation of her.\n\nIf she had really been false to her charge, if she had actually flinched\nand faltered at the crucial moment, had truly been the coward, this\ndeception which had been thrust upon her at the moment of her return to\nthe house, this part which it was so easy to play, would have been a\nhideous and unspeakable hypocrisy. But Lloyd had not faltered, had not\nbeen false. In her heart of hearts she had been true to herself and to\nher trust. How would she deceive her companions then by allowing them to\ncontinue in the belief of her constancy, fidelity, and courage? What she\nhid from them, or rather what they could not see, was a state of things\nthat it was impossible for any one but herself to understand. She could\nnot--no woman could--bring herself to confess to another woman what had\nhappened that day at Medford. It would be believed that she could have\nstayed at her patient's bedside if she had so desired. No one who did\nnot know Bennett could understand the terrible, vast force of the man.\n\nTry as she would, Lloyd could not but think first of herself at this\nmoment. Bennett was ignored, forgotten. Once she had loved him, but that\nwas all over now. The thought of Ferriss's death, for which in a manner\nshe had been forced to be responsible, came rushing to her mind from\ntime to time, and filled her with a horror and, at times, even a\nperverse sense of remorse, almost beyond words. But Lloyd's pride, her\nself-confidence, her strength of character and independence had been\ndearer to her than almost anything in life. So she told herself, and, at\nthat moment, honestly believed. And though she knew that her pride had\nbeen humbled, it was not gone, and enough of it remained to make her\ndesire and strive to keep the fact a secret from the world. It seemed\nvery easy. She would only have to remain passive. Circumstances acted\nfor her.\n\nMiss Douglass returned, followed by Rownie carrying a tray. When the\nmulatto had gone, after arranging Lloyd's supper on a little table near\nthe couch, the fever nurse drew up a chair.\n\n\"Now we can talk,\" she said, \"unless you are too tired. I've been so\ninterested in this case at Medford. Tell me what was the immediate cause\nof death; was it perforation or just gradual collapse?\"\n\n\"It was neither,\" said Lloyd quickly. \"It was a hemorrhage.\"\n\nShe had uttered the words with as little consciousness as a phonograph,\nand the lie had escaped her before she was aware. How did she know what\nhad been the immediate cause of death? What right had she to speak? Why\nwas it that all at once a falsehood had come so easy to her, to her\nwhose whole life until then had been so sincere, so genuine?\n\n\"A hemorrhage?\" repeated the other. \"Had there been many before then?\nWas there coma vigil when the end came? I--\"\n\n\"Oh,\" cried Lloyd with a quick gesture of impatience, \"don't, don't ask\nme any more. I am tired--nervous; I am worn out.\"\n\n\"Yes, of course you must be,\" answered the fever nurse. \"We won't talk\nany more about it.\"\n\nThat night and the following day were terrible. Lloyd neither ate nor\nslept. Not once did she set foot out of her room, giving out that she\nwas ill, which was not far from the truth, and keeping to herself and to\nthe companionship of the thoughts and terrors that crowded her mind.\nUntil that day at Medford her life had run easily and happily and in\nwell-ordered channels. She was successful in her chosen profession and\nwork. She imagined herself to be stronger and of finer fibre than most\nother women, and her love for Bennett had lent a happiness and a\nsweetness to her life dear to her beyond all words. Suddenly, and within\nan hour's time, she had lost everything. Her will had been broken, her\nspirit crushed; she had been forced to become fearfully instrumental in\ncausing the death of her patient--a man who loved and trusted her--while\nher love for Bennett, which for years had been her deep and abiding joy,\nthe one great influence of her life, was cold and dead, and could never\nbe revived.\n\nThis in the end came to be Lloyd's greatest grief. She could forget that\nshe herself had been humbled and broken. Horrible, unspeakably horrible,\nas Ferriss's death seemed to her, it was upon Bennett, and not upon her,\nthat its responsibility must be laid. She had done what she could. Of\nthat she was assured. But, first and above all things, Lloyd was a\nwoman, and her love for Bennett was a very different matter.\n\nWhen, during that never-to-be-forgotten scene in the breakfast-room of\nthe doctor's house, she had warned Bennett that if he persisted in his\ninsane resolution he would stamp out her affection for him, Lloyd had\nonly half believed what she said. But when at last it dawned upon her\nthat she had spoken wiser than she knew, that this was actually true,\nand that now, no matter how she might desire it, she could not love him\nany longer, it seemed as though her heart must break. It was precisely\nas though Bennett himself, the Bennett she had known, had been blotted\nout of existence. It was much worse than if Bennett had merely died.\nEven then he would have still existed for her, somewhere. As it was, the\nman she had known simply ceased to be, irrevocably, finally, and the\nwarmth of her love dwindled and grew cold, because now there was nothing\nleft for it to feed upon.\n\nNever until then had Lloyd realised how much he had been to her; how he\nhad not only played so large a part in her life, but how he had become a\nvery part of her life itself. Her love for him had been like the air,\nlike the sunlight; was delicately knitted and intertwined into all the\ninnumerable intricacies of her life and character. Literally, not an\nhour had ever passed that, directly or indirectly, he had not occupied\nher thoughts. He had been her inspiration; he had made her want to be\nbrave and strong and determined, and it was because of him that the\ngreater things of the world interested her. She had chosen a work to be\ndone because he had set her an example. So only that she preserved her\nwomanliness, she, too, wanted to count, to help on, to have her place in\nthe world's progress. In reality all her ambitions and hopes had been\nlooking toward one end only, that she might be his equal; that he might\nfind in her a companion and a confidante; one who could share his\nenthusiasms and understand his vast projects and great aims.\n\nAnd how had he treated her when at last opportunity had been given her\nto play her part, to be courageous and strong, to prevail against great\nodds, while he stood by to see? He had ignored and misunderstood, and\ntossed aside as childish and absurd that which she had been building up\nfor years. Instead of appreciating her heroism he had forced her to\nbecome a coward in the eyes of the world. She had hoped to be his equal,\nand he had treated her as a school-girl. It had all been a mistake. She\nwas not and could not be the woman she had hoped. He was not and never\nhad been the man she had imagined. They had nothing in common.\n\nBut it was not easy to give Bennett up, to let him pass out of her life.\nShe wanted to love him yet. With all her heart and strength, in spite of\neverything--woman that she was, she had come to that--in spite of\neverything she wanted to love him. Though he had broken her will,\nthwarted her ambitions, ignored her cherished hopes, misunderstood and\nmistaken her, yet, if she could, Lloyd would yet have loved him, loved\nhim even for the very fact that he had been stronger than she.\n\nAgain and again she tried to awaken this dead affection, to call back\nthis vanished love. She tried to remember the Bennett she had known; she\ntold herself that he loved her; that he had said that the great things\nhe had done had been done only with an eye to her approval; that she had\nbeen his inspiration no less than he had been hers; that he had fought\nhis way back, not only to life, but to her. She thought of all he had\nsuffered, of the hardships and privations beyond her imagination to\nconceive, that he had undergone. She tried to recall the infinite joy of\nthat night when the news of his safe return had come to her; she thought\nof him at his very best--how he had always seemed to her the type of the\nperfect man, masterful, aggressive, accomplishing great projects with an\nenergy and determination almost superhuman, one of the world's great\nmen, whose name the world still shouted. She called to mind how the very\nruggedness of his face; with its massive lines and harsh angles, had\nattracted her; how she had been proud of his giant's strength, the vast\nspan of his shoulders, the bull-like depth of his chest, the sense of\nenormous physical power suggested by his every movement.\n\nBut it was all of no effect. That Bennett was worse than dead to her.\nThe Bennett that now came to her mind and imagination was the brutal,\nperverse man of the breakfast-room at Medford, coarse, insolent,\nintractable, stamping out all that was finest in her, breaking and\nflinging away the very gifts he had inspired her to offer him. It was\nnothing to him that she should stand degraded in the eyes of the world.\nHe did not want her to be brave and strong. She had been wrong; it was\nnot that kind of woman he desired. He had not acknowledged that she,\ntoo, as well as he--a woman as well as a man might have her principles,\nher standards of honour, her ideas of duty. It was not her character,\nthen, that he prized; the nobility of her nature was nothing to him; he\ntook no thought of the fine-wrought texture of her mind. How, then, did\nshe appeal to him? It was not her mind; it was not her soul. What, then,\nwas left? Nothing but the physical. The shame of it; the degradation of\nit! To be so cruelly mistaken in the man she loved, to be able to appeal\nto him only on his lower side! Lloyd clasped her hands over her eyes,\nshutting her teeth hard against a cry of grief and pain and impotent\nanger. No, no, now it was irrevocable; now her eyes were opened. The\nBennett she had known and loved had been merely a creature of her own\nimagining; the real man had suddenly discovered himself; and this man,\nin spite of herself, she hated as a victim hates its tyrant.\n\nBut her grief for her vanished happiness--the happiness that this love,\nhowever mistaken, had brought into her life--was pitiful. Lloyd could\nnot think of it without the choke coming to her throat and the tears\nbrimming her dull-blue eyes, while at times a veritable paroxysm of\nsorrow seized upon her and flung her at full length upon her couch, her\nface buried and her whole body shaken with stifled sobs. It was gone, it\nwas gone, and could never be called back. What was there now left to her\nto live for? Why continue her profession? Why go on with the work? What\npleasure now in striving and overcoming? Where now was the exhilaration\nof battle with the Enemy, even supposing she yet had the strength to\ncontinue the fight? Who was there now to please, to approve, to\nencourage? To what end the days of grave responsibilities, the long,\nstill nights of vigil?\n\nShe began to doubt herself. Bennett, the man, had loved his work for its\nown sake. But how about herself, the woman? In what spirit had she gone\nabout her work? Had she been genuine, after all? Had she not undertaken\nit rather as a means than as an end--not because she cared for it, but\nbecause she thought he would approve, because she had hoped by means of\nthe work she would come into closer companionship with him? She wondered\nif this must always be so--the man loving the work for the work's sake;\nthe woman, more complex, weaker, and more dependent, doing the work only\nin reference to the man.\n\nBut often she distrusted her own conclusions, and, no doubt, rightly so.\nHer mind was yet too confused to reason calmly, soberly, and accurately.\nHer distress was yet too keen, too poignant to permit her to be logical.\nAt one time she was almost ready to admit that she had misjudged\nBennett; that, though he had acted cruelly and unjustly, he had done\nwhat he thought was best. His sacrifice of Ferriss was sufficient\nguarantee of his sincerity. But this mistrust of herself did not affect\nher feeling toward him. There were moments when she condoned his\noffence; there was never an instant she did not hate him.\n\nAnd this sentiment of hatred itself, independent of and apart from its\nobject, was distasteful and foreign to her. Never in her life had Lloyd\nhated any one before. To be kind, to be gentle, to be womanly was her\nsecond nature, and kindness, gentleness, and womanliness were qualities\nthat her profession only intensified and deepened. This newcomer in her\nheart, this fierce, evil visitor, that goaded her and pricked and\nharried her from day to day and throughout so many waking nights, that\nroused the unwonted flash in her eye and drove the hot, angry blood to\nher smooth, white forehead and knotted her levelled brows to a dark and\nlowering frown, had entered her life and being, unsought for and\nundesired. It did not belong to her world. Yet there it sat on its\nusurped throne deformed and hideous, driving out all tenderness and\ncompunction, ruling her with a rod of iron, hardening her, embittering\nher, and belittling her, making a mockery of all sweetness, fleering at\nnobility and magnanimity, lowering the queen to the level of the\nfishwife.\n\nWhen the first shock of the catastrophe had spent its strength and Lloyd\nperforce must turn again to the life she had to live, groping for its\nscattered, tangled ends, piecing together again as best she might its\nbroken fragments, she set herself honestly to drive this hatred from her\nheart. If she could not love Bennett, at least she need not hate him.\nShe was moved to this by no feeling of concern for Bennett. It was not a\nconsideration that she owed to him, but something rather that was due to\nherself. Yet, try as she would, the hatred still remained. She could not\nput it from her. Hurt her and contaminate her as it did, in spite of all\nher best efforts, in spite of her very prayers, the evil thing abode\nwith her, deep-rooted, strong, malignant. She saw that in the end she\nwould continue in her profession, but she believed that she could not go\non with it consistently, based as it was upon sympathy and love and\nkindness, while a firm-seated, active hatred dwelt with her, harassing\nher at every moment, and perverting each good impulse and each unselfish\ndesire. It was an ally of the very Enemy she would be called upon to\nfight, a traitor that at any moment might open the gates to his\ntriumphant entry.\n\nBut was this his only ally; was this the only false and ugly invader\nthat had taken advantage of her shattered defence? Had the unwelcome\nvisitor entered her heart alone? Was there not a companion still more\nwicked, more perverted, more insidious, more dangerous? For the first\ntime Lloyd knew what it meant to deceive.\n\nIt was supposed by her companions, and accepted by them as a matter of\ncourse, that she had not left the bedside of her patient until after his\ndeath. At first she had joyfully welcomed this mistake as her salvation,\nthe one happy coincidence that was to make her life possible, and for a\ntime had ceased to think about it. That phase of the incident was\nclosed. Matters would readjust themselves. In a few days' time the\nincident would be forgotten. But she found that she herself could not\nforget it, and that as days went on the idea of this passive, silent\ndeception she was obliged to maintain occurred to her oftener and\noftener. She remembered again how glibly and easily she had lied to her\nfriend upon the evening of her return. How was it that the lie had\nflowed so smoothly from her lips? To her knowledge she had never\ndeliberately lied before. She would have supposed that, because of this\nfact, falsehood would come difficult to her, that she would have\nbungled, hesitated, stammered. But it was the reverse that had been the\ncase. The facility with which she had uttered the lie was what now began\nto disturb and to alarm her. It argued some sudden collapse of her whole\nsystem of morals, some fundamental disarrangement of the entire machine.\n\nAbruptly she recoiled. Whither was she tending? If she supinely resigned\nherself to the current of circumstance, where would she be carried? Yet\nhow was she to free herself from the current, how to face this new\nsituation that suddenly presented itself at a time when she had fancied\nthe real shock of battle and contention was spent and past?\n\nHow was she to go back now? How could she retrace her steps? There was\nbut one way--correct the false impression. It would not be necessary to\nacknowledge that she had been forced to leave her post; the essential\nwas that her companions should know that she had deceived them--that she\nhad left the bedside before her patient's death. But at the thought of\nmaking such confession, public as it must be, everything that was left\nof her wounded pride revolted. She who had been so firm, she who had\nheld so tenaciously to her principles, she who had posed before them as\nan example of devotion and courage--she could not bring herself to that.\n\n\"No, no,\" she exclaimed as this alternative presented itself to her\nmind. \"No, I cannot. It is beyond me. I simply cannot do it.\"\n\nBut she could. Yes, she could do it if she would. Deep down in her mind\nthat little thought arose. She could if she wanted to. Hide it though\nshe might, cover it and bury it with what false reasoning she could\ninvent, the little thought would not be smothered, would not be crushed\nout. Well, then, she would not. Was it not her chance; was not this\ndeception which others and not herself had created, her opportunity to\nrecover herself, to live down what had been done--what she had been\nforced to do, rather? Absolute right was never to be attained; was not\nlife to be considered rather in the light of a compromise between good\nand evil? To do what one could under the circumstances, was not that the\ngolden mean?\n\nBut she ought. And, quick, another little thought sprang up in the\ndeeper recesses of her mind and took its place beside the other. It was\nright that she should be true. She ought to do the right. Argument, the\npleas of weakness, the demands of expediency, the plausibility of\ncompromise were all of no avail. The idea \"I ought\" persisted and\npersisted and persisted. She could and she ought. There was no excuse\nfor her, and no sooner had she thrust aside the shifty mass of\nsophistries under which she had striven to conceal them, no sooner had\nshe let in the light, than these two conceptions of Duty and Will began\nsuddenly to grow.\n\nBut what was she to gain? What would be the result of such a course as\nher conscience demanded she should adopt? It was inevitable that she\nwould be misunderstood, cruelly misjudged. What action would her\nconfession entail? She could not say. But results did not matter; what\nshe was to gain or lose did not matter. Around her and before her all\nwas dark and vague and terrible. If she was to escape there was but one\nthing to do. Suddenly her own words came back to her:\n\n\"All we can do is to hold to what we know is right, and trust that\neverything will come well in the end.\"\n\nShe knew what was right, and she had the strength to hold to it. Then\nall at once there came to Lloyd a grand, breathless sense of uplifting,\nalmost a transfiguration. She felt herself carried high above the sphere\nof little things, the region of petty considerations What did she care\nfor consequences, what mattered to her the unjust condemnation of her\nworld, if only she remained true to herself, if only she did right? What\ndid she care for what she gained? It was no longer a question of gain or\nloss--it was a question of being true and strong and brave. The conflict\nof that day at Medford between the man's power and the woman's\nresistance had been cruel, the crisis had been intense, and though she\nhad been conquered then, had it, after all, been beyond recall? No, she\nwas not conquered. No, she was not subdued. Her will had not been\nbroken, her courage had not been daunted, her strength had not been\nweakened. Here was the greater fight, here was the higher test. Here was\nthe ultimate, supreme crisis of all, and here, at last, come what might,\nshe would not, would not, would not fail.\n\nAs soon as Lloyd reached this conclusion she sat about carrying her\nresolution into effect.\n\n\"If I don't do it now while I'm strong,\" she told herself, \"if I wait, I\nnever will do it.\"\n\nPerhaps there was yet a touch of the hysterical in her actions even\nthen. The jangled feminine nerves were yet vibrating far above their\nnormal pitch; she was overwrought and oversensitive, for just as a\nfanatic rushes eagerly upon the fire and the steel, preferring the more\nexquisite torture, so Lloyd sought out the more painful situation, the\nmore trying ordeal, the line of action that called for the greatest\nfortitude, the most unflinching courage.\n\nShe chose to make known her real position, to correct the false\nimpression at a time when all the nurses of the house should be\ntogether. This would be at supper-time. Since her return from Medford,\nLloyd had shut herself away from the other inmates of the house, and had\ntaken her meals in her room. With the exception of Miss Douglass and the\nsuperintendent nurse no one had seen her. She had passed her time lying\nat full length upon her couch, her hands clasped behind her head, or\npacing the floor, or gazing listlessly out of her windows, while her\nthoughts raced at a gallop through her mind.\n\nNow, however, she bestirred herself. She had arrived at her final\ndecision early in the afternoon of the third day after her return, and\nat once she resolved that she would endure the ordeal that very evening.\n\nShe passed the intervening time, singularly enough, in very carefully\nsetting her room to rights, adjusting and readjusting the few ornaments\non the mantel-shelf and walls, winding the clock that struck ship's\nbells instead of the hours, and minutely sorting the letters and papers\nin her desk. It was the same as if she were going upon a long journey or\nwere preparing for a great sickness. Toward four o'clock Miss Douglass,\nlooking in to ask how she did, found her before her mirror carefully\ncombing and arranging her great bands and braids of dark-red hair. The\nfever nurse declared that she was immensely improved in appearance, and\nasked at once if she was not feeling better.\n\n\"Yes,\" answered Lloyd, \"very much better,\" adding: \"I shall be down to\nsupper to-night.\"\n\nFor some reason that she could not explain Lloyd took unusual pains with\nher toilet, debating long over each detail of dress and ornament. At\nlength, toward five o'clock, she was ready, and sat down by her window,\na book in her lap, to await the announcement of supper as the condemned\nawait the summons to execution.\n\nHer plan was to delay her appearance in the dining-room until she was\nsure that everybody was present; then she would go down, and, standing\nthere before them all, say what she had to say, state the few bald facts\nof the case, without excuse or palliation, and leave them to draw the\none inevitable conclusion.\n\nBut this final hour of waiting was a long agony for Lloyd. Her moods\nchanged with every moment; the action she contemplated presented itself\nto her mind in a multitude of varying lights. At one time she quivered\nwith the apprehension of it, as though at the slow approach of hot\nirons. At another she could see no reason for being greatly concerned\nover the matter. Did the whole affair amount to so much, after all? Her\ncompanions would, of their own accord, make excuses for her. Risking\none's life in the case of a virulent, contagious disease was no small\nmatter. No one could be blamed for leaving such a case. At one moment\nLloyd's idea of public confession seemed to her little less than\nsublime; at another, almost ridiculous. But she remembered the case of\nHarriet Freeze, who had been unable to resist the quiet, unexpressed\nforce of opinion of her fellow-workers. It would be strange if Lloyd\nshould find herself driven from the very house she had built.\n\nThe hour before supper-time seemed interminable; the quarter passed,\nthen the half, then the three-quarters. Lloyd imagined she began to\ndetect a faint odour of the kitchen in the air. Suddenly the remaining\nminutes of the hour began to be stricken from the dial of her clock with\nbewildering rapidity. From the drawing-room immediately below came the\nsounds of the piano. That was Esther Thielman, no doubt, playing one of\nher interminable Polish compositions. All at once the piano stopped,\nand, with a quick sinking of the heart, Lloyd heard the sliding doors\nseparating the drawing-room from the dining-room roll back. Miss\nDouglass and another one of the nurses, Miss Truslow, a young girl, a\nnewcomer in the house, came out of the former's room and went\ndownstairs, discussing the merits of burlap as preferable to wall-paper.\nLloyd even heard Miss Truslow remark:\n\n\"Yes, that's very true, but if it isn't sized it will wrinkle in damp\nweather.\"\n\nRownie came to Lloyd's door and knocked, and, without waiting for a\nreply, said:\n\n\"Dinneh's served, Miss Searight,\" and Lloyd heard her make the same\nannouncement at Miss Bergyn's room farther down the hall. One by one\nLloyd heard the others go downstairs. The rooms and hallways on the\nsecond floor fell quiet. A faint, subdued murmur of talk came to her\nears in the direction of the dining-room. Lloyd waited for five, for\nten, for fifteen minutes. Then she rose, drawing in her breath,\nstraightening herself to her full height. She went to the door, then\npaused for a moment, looking back at all the familiar objects--the\nplain, rich furniture, the book-shelves, the great, comfortable couch,\nthe old-fashioned round mirror that hung between the windows, and her\nwriting-desk of blackened mahogany. It seemed to her that in some way\nshe was never to see these things again, as if she were saying good-bye\nto them and to the life she had led in that room and in their\nsurroundings. She would be a different woman when she came back to that\nroom. Slowly she descended the stairs and halted for a moment in the\nhall below. It was not too late to turn back even now. She could hear\nher companions at their supper very plainly, and could distinguish\nEsther Thielman's laugh as she exclaimed:\n\n\"Why, of course, that's the very thing I mean.\"\n\nIt was a strange surprise that Lloyd had in store for them all. Her\nheart began to beat heavy and thick. Could she even find her voice to\nspeak when the time came? Would it not be better to put it off, to think\nover the whole matter again between now and to-morrow morning? But she\nmoved her head impatiently. No, she would not turn back. She found that\nthe sliding doors in the drawing-room had been closed, and so went to\nthe door that opened into the dining-room from the hall itself. It stood\najar. Lloyd pushed it open, entered, and, closing the door behind her,\nstood there leaning against it.\n\nThe table was almost full; only two or three places besides her own were\nunoccupied. There was Miss Bergyn at the head; the fever nurse, Miss\nDouglass, at her right, and, lower down, Lloyd saw Esther Thielman;\nDelia Craig, just back from a surgical case of Dr. Street's; Miss Page,\nthe oldest and most experienced nurse of them all; Gilbertson, whom\nevery one called by her last name; Miss Ives and Eleanor Bogart, who had\nboth taken doctors' degrees, and could have practised if they had\ndesired; Miss Wentworth, who had served an apprenticeship in a\nmissionary hospital in Armenia, and had known Clara Barton, and, last of\nall, the newcomer, Miss Truslow, very young and very pretty, who had\nnever yet had a case, and upon whose diploma the ink was hardly dry.\n\nAt first, so quietly had she entered, no one took any notice of Lloyd,\nand she stood a moment, her back to the door, wondering how she should\nbegin. Everybody seemed to be in the best of humour; a babel of talk was\nin the air; conversations were going forward, carried on across the\ntable, or over intervening shoulders.\n\n\"Why, of course, don't you see, that's the very thing I meant--\"\n\n\"--I think you can get that already sized, though, and with a stencil\nfigure if you want it--\"\n\n\"--Really, it's very interesting; the first part is stupid, but she has\nsome very good ideas.\"\n\n\"--Yes, at Vanoni's. But we get a reduction, you know--\"\n\n\"--and, oh, listen; this is too funny; she turned around and said, very\nprim and stiff, 'No, indeed; I'm too old a woman.' Funny! If I think of\nthat on my deathbed I shall laugh--\"\n\n\"--and so that settled it. How could I go on after that--?\"\n\n\"--Must you tack it on? The walls are so hard--\"\n\n\"Let Rownie do it; she knows. Oh, here's the invalid!\"\n\n\"Oh, why, it's Lloyd! We're so glad you're able to come down!\"\n\nBut when they had done exclaiming over her reappearance among them Lloyd\nstill remained as she was, her back against the door, standing very\nstraight, her hands at her side. She did not immediately reply. Heads\nwere turned in her direction. The talk fell away by rapid degrees as\nthey began to notice the paleness of her face and the strange, firm set\nof her mouth.\n\n\"Sit down, Lloyd,\" said Miss Bergyn; \"don't stand. You are not very well\nyet; I'll have Rownie bring you a glass of sherry.\"\n\nThere was a silence. Then at length:\n\n\"No,\" said Lloyd quietly. \"I don't want any sherry. I don't want any\nsupper. I came down to tell you that you are all wrong in thinking I did\nwhat I could with my typhoid case at Medford. You think I left only\nafter the patient had died. I did not; I left before. There was a crisis\nof some kind. I don't know what it was, because I was not in the\nsick-room at the time, and I did not go when I was called. The doctor\nwas not there either; he had gone out and left the case in my charge.\nThere was nobody with the patient but a servant. The servant called me,\nbut I did not go. Instead I came away and left the house. The patient\ndied that same day. It is that that I wanted to tell you. Do you all\nunderstand--perfectly? I left my patient at the moment of a crisis, and\nwith no one with him but a servant. And he died that same afternoon.\"\n\nThen she went out, and the closing of the door jarred sharply upon the\ngreat silence that had spread throughout the room.\n\nLloyd went back to her room, closed and locked the door, and, sinking\ndown upon the floor by the couch, bowed her head upon her folded arms.\nBut she was in no mood for weeping, and her eyes were dry. She was\nconscious chiefly that she had taken an irrevocable step, that her head\nhad begun to ache. There was no exhilaration in her mind now; she did\nnot feel any of the satisfaction of attainment after struggle, of\ntriumph after victory. More than once she even questioned herself if,\nafter all, her confession had been necessary. But now she was weary unto\ndeath of the whole wretched business. Now she only knew that her head\nwas aching fiercely; she did not care either to look into the past or\nforward into the future. The present occupied her; for the present her\nhead was aching.\n\nBut before Lloyd went to bed that night Miss Bergyn knew the whole truth\nas to what had happened at Dr. Pitts's house. The superintendent nurse\nhad followed Lloyd to her room almost immediately, and would not be\ndenied. She knew very well that Lloyd Searight had never left a dying\npatient of her own volition. Intuitively she guessed at something\nhidden.\n\n\"Lloyd,\" she said decisively, \"don't ask me to believe that you went of\nyour own free will. Tell me just what happened. Why did you go? Ask me\nto believe anything but that you--no, I won't say the word. There was\nsome very good reason, wasn't there?\"\n\n\"I--I cannot explain,\" Lloyd answered. \"You must think what you choose.\nYou wouldn't understand.\"\n\nBut, happily, when Lloyd's reticence finally broke Miss Bergyn did\nunderstand. The superintendent nurse knew Bennett only by report. But\nLloyd she had known for years, and realised that if she had yielded, it\nhad only been after the last hope had been tried. In the end Lloyd told\nher everything that had occurred. But, though she even admitted\nBennett's affection for her, she said nothing about herself, and Miss\nBergyn did not ask.\n\n\"I know, of course,\" said the superintendent nurse at length, \"you hate\nto think that you were made to go; but men are stronger than women,\nLloyd, and such a man as that must be stronger than most men. You were\nnot to blame because you left the case, and you are certainly not to\nblame for Mr. Ferriss's death. Now I shall give it out here in the house\nthat you had a very good reason for leaving your case, and that while we\ncan't explain it any more particularly, I have had a talk with you and\nknow all about it, and am perfectly satisfied. Then I shall go out to\nMedford and see Dr. Pitts. It would be best,\" she added, for Lloyd had\nmade a gesture of feeble dissent. \"He must understand perfectly, and we\nneed not be afraid of any talk about the matter at all. What has\nhappened has happened 'in the profession,' and I don't believe it will\ngo any further.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLloyd returned to Bannister toward the end of the week. How long she\nwould remain she did not know, but for the present the association of\nthe other nurses was more than she was able to bear. Later, when the\naffair had become something of an old story, she would return, resuming\nher work as though nothing had happened.\n\nHattie met her at the railway station with the phaeton and the ponies.\nShe was radiant with delight at the prospect of having Lloyd all to\nherself for an indefinite period of time.\n\n\"And you didn't get sick, after all?\" she exclaimed, clasping her hands.\n\"Was your patient as sick as I was? Weren't his parents glad that you\nmade him well again?\"\n\nLloyd put her hand over the little girl's mouth.\n\n\"Let us not talk any 'shop,' Hattie,\" she said, trying to smile.\n\nBut on the morning after her arrival Lloyd woke in her own white room of\nthe old farmhouse, abruptly conscious of some subtle change that had\noccurred to her overnight. For the first time since the scene in the\nbreakfast-room at Medford she was aware of a certain calmness that had\ncome to her. Perhaps she had at last begun to feel the good effects of\nthe trial by fire which she had voluntarily undergone--to know a certain\nhappiness that now there was no longer any deceit in her heart. This she\nhad uprooted and driven out by force of her own will. It was gone. But\nnow, on this morning, she seemed to feel that this was not all.\n\nSomething else had left her--something that of late had harassed her and\ngoaded her and embittered her life, and mocked at her gentleness and\nkindness, was gone. That fierce, truculent hatred that she had so\nstriven to put from her, now behold! of its own accord, it had seemed to\nleave her. How had it happened? Before she had dared the ordeal of\nconfession this feeling of hatred, this perverse and ugly changeling\nthat had brooded in her heart, had seemed too strong, too deeply seated\nto be moved. Now, suddenly, it had departed, unbidden, without effort on\nher part.\n\nVaguely Lloyd wondered at this thing. In driving deceit from her it\nwould appear that she had also driven out hatred, that the one could not\nstay so soon as the other had departed. Could the one exist apart from\nthe other? Was there, then, some strange affinity in all evil, as,\nperhaps, in all good, so that a victory over one bad impulse meant a\nvictory over many? Without thought of gain or of reward, she had held to\nwhat was right through the confusion and storm and darkness. Was this to\nbe, after all, her reward, her gain? Possibly; but she could not tell,\nshe could not see. The confusion was subsiding, the storm had passed,\nbut much of the darkness yet remained. Deceit she had fought from out\nher heart; silently Hatred had stolen after it. Love had not returned to\nhis old place, and never, never would, but the changeling was gone, and\nthe house was swept and garnished.\n\n\n\n\nVIII.\n\n\nThe day after the funeral, Bennett returned alone to Dr. Pitts's house\nat Medford, and the same evening his trunks and baggage, containing his\npapers--the records, observations, journals, and log-books of the\nexpedition--followed him.\n\nAs Bennett entered the gate of the place that he had chosen to be his\nhome for the next year, he was aware that the windows of one of the\nfront rooms upon the second floor were wide open, the curtains tied up\ninto loose knots; inside a servant came and went, putting the room to\nrights again, airing it and changing the furniture. In the road before\nthe house he had seen the marks of the wheels of the undertaker's wagon\nwhere it had been backed up to the horse-block. As he closed the front\ndoor behind him and stood for a moment in the hallway, his valise in his\nhand, he saw, hanging upon one of the pegs of the hat-rack, the hat\nFerriss had last worn. Bennett put down his valise quickly, and,\nsteadying himself against the wall, leaned heavily against it, drawing a\ndeep breath, his eyes closing.\n\nThe house was empty and, but for the occasional subdued noises that came\nfrom the front room at the end of the hall, silent. Bennett picked up\nhis valise again and went upstairs to the rooms that had been set apart\nfor him. He did not hang his hat upon the hat-rack, but carried it with\nhim.\n\nThe housekeeper, who met him at the head of the stairs and showed him\nthe way to his apartments, inquired of him as to the hours he wished to\nhave his meals served. Bennett told her, and then added:\n\n\"I will have all my meals in the breakfast-room, the one you call the\nglass-room, I believe. And as soon as the front room is ready I shall\nsleep there. That will be my room after this.\"\n\nThe housekeeper stared. \"It won't be quite safe, sir, for some time. The\ndoctor gave very strict orders about ventilating it and changing the\nfurniture.\"\n\nBennett merely nodded as if to say he understood, and the housekeeper\nsoon after left him to himself. The afternoon passed, then the evening.\nSuch supper as Bennett could eat was served according to his orders in\nthe breakfast-room. Afterward he called Kamiska, and went for a long\nwalk over the country roads in a direction away from the town,\nproceeding slowly, his hands clasped behind his back. Later, toward ten\no'clock, he returned. He went upstairs toward his room with the\nhalf-formed idea of looking over and arranging his papers before going\nto bed. Sleep he could not; he foresaw that clearly.\n\nBut Bennett was not yet familiar with the arrangement of the house. His\nmind was busy with other things; he was thoughtful, abstracted, and upon\nreaching the stair landing on the second floor, turned toward the front\nof the house when he should have turned toward the rear. He entered what\nhe supposed to be his room, lit the gas, then stared about him in some\nperplexity.\n\nThe room he was in was almost bare of furniture. Even part of the carpet\nhad been taken up. The windows were wide open; a stale odour of drugs\npervaded the air, while upon the bed nothing remained but the mattress\nand bolster. For a moment Bennett looked about him bewildered, then he\nstarted sharply. This was--had been--the sick-room. Here, upon that bed,\nFerriss had died; here had been enacted one scene in the terrible drama\nwherein he, Bennett, had played so conspicuous a part.\n\nAs Bennett stood there looking about him, one hand upon the foot-board of\nthe bed, a strange, formless oppression of the spirit weighed heavily\nupon him. He seemed to see upon that naked bed the wasted,\nfever-stricken body of the dearest friend he had ever known. It was as\nthough Ferriss were lying in state there, with black draperies hung\nabout the bier and candles burning at the head and foot. Death had been\nin that room. Empty though it was, a certain religious solemnity, almost\na certain awe, seemed to bear down upon the senses. Before he knew it\nBennett found himself kneeling at the denuded bed, his face buried, his\narms flung wide across the place where Ferriss had last reposed.\n\nHe could not say how long he remained thus--perhaps ten minutes, perhaps\nan hour. He seemed to come to himself once more when he stepped out into\nthe hall again, closing and locking the door of the death-room behind\nhim. But now all thought of work had left him. In the morning he would\narrange his papers. It was out of the question to think of sleep. He\ndescended once more to the lower floor of the silent house, and stepped\nout again into the open air.\n\nOn the veranda, close beside him, was a deep-seated wicker arm-chair.\nBennett sank down into it, drawing his hands wearily across his\nforehead. The stillness of a summer night had settled broadly over the\nvast, dim landscape. There was no moon; all the stars were out. Very far\noff a whippoorwill was calling incessantly. Once or twice from the\nlittle orchard close at hand an apple dropped with a faint rustle of\nleaves and a muffled, velvety impact upon the turf. Kamiska, wide awake,\nsat motionless upon her haunches on the steps, looking off into the\nnight, cocking an ear to every faintest sound.\n\nWell, Ferriss was dead, and he, Bennett, was responsible. His friend,\nthe man whom most he loved, was dead. The splendid fight he had made for\nhis life during that ferocious struggle with the Ice had been all of no\neffect. Without a murmur, without one complaint he had borne starvation,\nthe bitter arctic cold, privation beyond words, the torture of the frost\nthat had gnawed away his hands, the blinding fury of the snow and wind,\nthe unceasing and incredible toil with sledge and pack--all the terrible\nhardship of an unsuccessful attempt to reach the Pole, only to die\nmiserably in his bed, alone, abandoned by the man and woman whom, of all\npeople of the world, he had most loved and trusted. And he, Bennett, had\nbeen to blame.\n\nWas Ferriss conscious during that last moment? Did he know; would he,\nsometime, somewhere, know? It could not be said. Forever that must\nremain a mystery. And, after all, had Bennett done right in keeping\nLloyd from the sick-room? Now that all was over, now that the whole\nfearful tragedy could be judged somewhat calmly and in the light of\nreason, the little stealthy doubt began to insinuate itself.\n\nAt first he had turned from it, raging and furious, stamping upon it as\nupon an intruding reptile. The rough-hewn, simple-natured man, with his\narrogant and vast self-confidence, his blind, unshaken belief in the\nwisdom of his own decisions, had never in his life before been willing\nto admit that he could be mistaken, that it was possible for him to\nresolve upon a false line of action. He had always been right. But now a\nchange had come. A woman had entangled herself in the workings of his\nworld, the world that hitherto had been only a world of men for him--and\nnow he faltered, now he questioned himself, now he scrutinised his\nmotives, now the simple became complicated, the straight crooked, right\nmingled with wrong, bitter with sweet, falseness with truth.\n\nHe who had faith in himself to remove mountains, he who could drive his\nfellow-men as a herder drives his sheep, he who had forced the vast grip\nof the Ice, had, with a battering ram's force, crushed his way through\nthose terrible walls, shattered and breached and broken down the\nbarriers, now in this situation involving a woman--had he failed? Had he\nweakened? And bigger, stronger, and more persistently doubt intruded\nitself into his mind.\n\nHitherto Bennett's only salvation from absolute despair had been the\nfirm consciousness of his own rectitude. In that lay his only comfort,\nhis only hope, his one, strong-built fabric of defence. If that was\nundermined, if that was eaten away, what was there left for him?\nCarefully, painfully, and with such minuteness as he could command, he\nwent over the whole affair from beginning to end, forcing his unwilling\nmind--so unaccustomed to such work--to weigh each chance, to gauge each\nopportunity. If _this_ were so, if _that_ had been done, then would\n_such_ results have followed? Suppose he had not interfered, suppose he\nhad stood aside, would Lloyd have run such danger, after all, and would\nFerriss at this time have been alive, and perhaps recovering? Had he,\nBennett, been absolutely mad; had he been blind and deaf to reason; had\nhe acted the part of a brute--a purblind, stupid, and unutterably\nselfish brute--thinking chiefly of himself, after all, crushing the\nwoman who was so dear to him, sacrificing the life of the man he loved,\nblundering in there, besotted and ignorant, acting the bully's part,\nunnecessarily frightened, cowardly where he imagined himself brave;\nweak, contemptibly weak, where he imagined himself strong? Might it not\nhave been avoided if he had been even merely reasonable, as, in like\ncase, an ordinary man would have been? He, who prided himself upon the\npromptness and soundness of his judgment in great crises, had lost his\nhead and all power of self-control in this greatest crisis of all.\n\nThe doubt came back to him again and again. Trample it, stifle it, dash\nit from him as he would, each time it returned a little stronger, a\nlittle larger, a little more insistent. Perhaps, after all, he had made\na mistake; perhaps, after all, Lloyd ran no great danger; perhaps, after\nall, Ferriss might now have been alive. All at once Bennett seemed to be\nsure of this.\n\nThen it became terrible. Alone there, in the darkness and in the night,\nBennett went down into the pit. Abruptly he seemed to come to\nhimself--to realise what he had done, as if rousing from a nightmare.\nRemorse, horror, self-reproach, the anguish of bereavement, the infinite\nregret of things that never were to be again, the bitterness of a\nvanished love, self-contempt too abject for expression, the\nheart-breaking grief of the dreadful might-have-been, one by one, he\nknew them all. One by one, like the slow accumulation of gigantic\nburdens, the consequences of his folly descended upon him, heavier, more\nintolerably, more inexorably fixed with every succeeding moment, while\nthe light of truth and reason searched every corner of his mind, and his\ndoubt grew and hardened into certainty.\n\nIf only Bennett could have believed that, in spite of what had happened,\nLloyd yet loved him, he could have found some ray of light in the\ndarkness wherein he groped, some saving strength to bear the weight of\nhis remorse and sorrow. But now, just in proportion as he saw clearer\nand truer he saw that he must look for no help in that direction. Being\nwhat Lloyd was, it was impossible for her, even though she wished it, to\nlove him now--love the man who had broken her! The thought was\npreposterous. He remembered clearly that she had warned him of just\nthis. No, that, too, the one sweetness of his rugged life, he must put\nfrom him as well--had already, and of his own accord, put from him.\n\nHow go on? Of what use now was ambition, endeavour, and the striving to\nattain great ends? The thread of his life was snapped; his friend was\ndead, and the love of the one woman of his world. For both he was to\nblame. Of what avail was it now to continue his work?\n\nFerriss was dead. Who now would stand at his side when the darkness\nthickened on ahead and obstacles drew across the path and Death overhead\nhung poised and menacing?\n\nLloyd's love for him was dead. Who now to bid him godspeed as his\nvessel's prow swung northward and the water whitened in her wake? Who\nnow to wait behind when the great fight was dared again, to wait behind\nand watch for his home-coming; and when the mighty hope had been\nachieved, the goal of all the centuries attained, who now to send that\nfirst and dearest welcome out to him when the returning ship showed over\nthe horizon's rim, flagged from her decks to her crosstrees in all the\nroyal blazonry of an immortal triumph?\n\nNow, that triumph was never to be for him. Ambition, too, was dead; some\nother was to win where now he could but lose, to gain where now he could\nbut fail; some other stronger than he, more resolute, more determined.\nAt last Bennett had come to this, he who once had been so imperial in\nthe consciousness of his power, so arrogant, so uncompromising. Beaten,\nbeaten at last; defeated, daunted, driven from his highest hopes,\nabandoning his dearest ambitions. And how, and why? Not by the Enemy he\nhad so often faced and dared, not by any power external to himself; but\nby his very self's self, crushed by the engine he himself had set in\nmotion, shattered by the recoil of the very force that for so long had\ndwelt within himself. Nothing in all the world could have broken him but\nthat. Danger, however great, could not have cowed him; circumstances,\nhowever hopeless, could not have made him despair; obstacles, however\nvast, could not have turned him back. Himself was the only Enemy that\ncould have conquered; his own power the only one to which he would have\nyielded. And fate had so ordered it that this one Enemy of all others,\nthis one power of all others, had turned upon and rent him. The mystery\nof it! The terror of it! Why had he never known? How was it he had never\nguessed? What was this ruthless monster, this other self, that for so\nlong had slept within his flesh, strong with his better strength,\nfeeding and growing big with that he fancied was the best in him, that\ntricked him with his noblest emotion--the love of a good woman--lured\nhim to a moment of weakness, then suddenly, and without warning, leaped\nat his throat and struck him to the ground?\n\nHe had committed one of those offences which the law does not reach, but\nwhose punishment is greater than any law can inflict. Retribution had\nbeen fearfully swift. His career, Ferriss, and Lloyd--ambition,\nfriendship, and the love of a woman--had been a trinity of dominant\nimpulses in his life. Abruptly, almost in a single instant, he had lost\nthem all, had thrown them away. He could never get them back. Bennett\nstarted sharply. What was this on his cheek; what was this that suddenly\ndimmed his eyes? Had it actually come to this? And this was\nhe--Bennett--the same man who had commanded the Freja expedition. No, it\nwas not the same man. That man was dead. He ground his teeth, shaken\nwith the violence of emotions that seemed to be tearing his heart to\npieces. Lost, lost to him forever! Bennett bowed his head upon his\nfolded arms. Through his clenched teeth his words seemed almost wrenched\nfrom him, each word an agony.\n\n\"Dick--Dick, old man, you're gone, gone from me, and it was I who did\nit; and Lloyd, she too--she--God help me!\"\n\nThen the tension snapped. The great, massive frame shook with grief from\nhead to heel, and the harsh, angular face, with its salient jaw and\nhard, uncouth lines, was wet with the first tears he had ever known.\n\nHe was roused at length by a sudden movement on the part of the dog.\nKamiska had risen to her feet with a low growl, then, as the gate-latch\nclinked, she threw up her head and gave tongue to the night with all the\nforce of her lungs. Bennett straightened up, thanking fortune that the\nnight was dark, and looked about him. A figure was coming up the front\nwalk, the gravel crunching under foot. It was the figure of a man. At\nthe foot of the steps of the veranda he paused, and as Bennett made a\nmovement turned in his direction and said:\n\n\"Is this Dr. Pitts's house?\"\n\nBennett's reply was drowned in the clamour of the dog, but the other\nseemed to understand, for he answered:\n\n\"I'm looking for Mr. Ferriss--Richard Ferriss, of the Freja; they told\nme he was brought here.\"\n\nKamiska stopped her barking, sniffed once or twice at the man's trouser\nlegs; then, in brusque frenzy of delight, leaped against him, licking\nhis hands, dancing about him on two legs, whining and yelping.\n\nBennett came forward, and the man changed his position so that the light\nfrom the half-open front door shone upon his face.\n\n\"Why, Adler!\" exclaimed Bennett; \"well, where did you come from?\"\n\n\"Mr. Bennett!\" almost shouted the other, snatching off his cap. \"It\nain't really you, sir!\" His face beamed and radiated a joy little short\nof beatitude. The man was actually trembling with happiness. Words\nfailed him, and as with a certain clumsy tenderness he clasped Bennett's\nhand in both his own his old-time chief saw the tears in his eyes.\n\n\"Oh! Maybe I ain't glad to see you, sir--I thought you had gone away--I\ndidn't know where--I--I didn't know as I was ever going to see you\nagain.\"\n\nKamiska herself had been no less tremulously glad to see Adler than was\nAdler to see Bennett. He stammered, he confused himself, he shifted his\nweight from one foot to the other, his eyes danced, he laughed and\nchoked, he dropped his cap. His joy was that of a child, unrestrained,\nunaffected, as genuine as gold. When they turned back to the veranda he\neagerly drew up Bennett's chair for him, his eyes never leaving his\nface. It was the quivering, inarticulate affection of a dog for its\nmaster, faithful, submissive, unquestioning, happy for hours over a\nchance look, a kind word, a touch of the hand. To Adler's mind it would\nhave been a privilege and an honour to have died for Bennett. Why, he\nwas his chief, his king, his god, his master, who could do no wrong.\nBennett could have slain him where he stood and Adler would still have\ntrusted him.\n\nAdler would not sit down until Bennett had twice ordered him to do so,\nand then he deposited himself in a nearby chair, in as uncomfortable a\nposition as he could devise, allowing only the smallest fraction of his\nbody to be supported as a mark of deference. He remained uncovered, and\nfrom time to time nervously saluted. But suddenly he remembered the\nobject of his visit.\n\n\"Oh, but I forgot--seeing you like this, unexpected, sir, clean drove\nMr. Ferriss out of my mind. How is he getting on? I saw in the papers he\nwas main sick.\"\n\n\"He's dead,\" said Bennett quietly.\n\nAdler was for the moment stricken speechless. His jaw dropped; he\nstared, and caught his breath.\n\n\"Mr. Ferriss dead!\" he exclaimed at length. \"I--I can't believe it.\" He\ncrossed himself rapidly. Bennett made no reply, and for upward of five\nminutes the two men sat motionless in the chairs, looking off into the\nnight. After a while Adler broke silence and asked a few questions as to\nFerriss's sickness and the nature and time of his death--questions which\nBennett answered as best he might. But it was evident that Bennett,\nalive and present there in the flesh, was more to Adler than Ferriss\ndead.\n\n\"But _you're_ all right, sir, ain't you?\" he asked at length. \"There\nain't anything the matter with you?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Bennett; looking at him steadily; then suddenly he added:\n\n\"Adler, I was to blame for Mr. Ferriss's death. If it hadn't been for me\nhe would probably have been alive to-night. It was my fault. I did what\nI thought was right, when I knew all the time, just as I know now, that\nI was wrong. So, when any one asks you about Mr. Ferriss's death you are\nto tell him just what you know about it--understand? Through a mistake I\nwas responsible for his death. I shall not tell you more than that, but\nthat much you ought to know.\"\n\nAdler looked at Bennett curiously and with infinite amazement. The order\nof his universe was breaking up about his ears. Bennett, the\ninscrutable, who performed his wonders in a mystery, impenetrable to\ncommon eyes, who moved with his head in the clouds, behold! he was\nrendering account to him, Adler, the meanest of his subjects--the king\nwas condescending to the vassal, was admitting him to his confidence.\nAnd what was this thing he was saying, that he was responsible for\nFerriss's death? Adler did not understand; his wits could not adjust\nthemselves to such information. Ferriss was dead, but how was Bennett to\nblame? The king could do no wrong. Adler did not understand. No doubt\nBennett was referring to something that had happened during the retreat\nover the ice--something that had to be done, and that in the end, and\nafter all this lapse of time, had brought about Mr. Ferriss's death. In\nany case Bennett had done what was right. For that matter he had been\nresponsible for McPherson's death; but what else had there been to do?\n\nBennett had spoken as he did after a moment's rapid thinking. To Adler's\nquestions as to the manner of the chief engineer's death Bennett had at\nfirst given evasive replies. But a sudden sense of shame at being\ncompelled to dissemble before a subordinate had lashed him across the\nface. True, he had made a mistake--a fearful, unspeakable mistake--but\nat least let him be man enough to face and to accept its consequences.\nIt might not be necessary or even expedient to make acknowledgment of\nhis folly in all quarters, but at that moment it seemed to him that his\nmen--at least one of them--who had been under the command of himself and\nhis friend, had a right to be told the truth. It had been only one\ndegree less distasteful to undeceive Adler than it had been to deceive\nhim in the first place. Bennett was not the general to explain his\nactions to his men. But he had not hesitated a moment.\n\nHowever, Adler was full of another subject, and soon broke out with:\n\n\"You know, sir, there's another expedition forming; I suppose you have\nheard--an English one. They call it the Duane-Parsons expedition. They\nare going to try the old route by Smith Sound. They are going to winter\nat Tasiusak, and try to get through the sound as soon as the ice breaks\nup in the spring. But Duane's ideas are all wrong. He'll make no very\nhigh northing, not above eighty-five. I'll bet a hat. When we go up\nagain, sir, will you--will you let me--will you take me along? Did I\ngive satisfaction this last--\"\n\n\"I'm never going up again, Adler,\" answered Bennett.\n\n\"Sho!\" said Adler a little blankly. \"I thought sure--I never thought\nthat you--why, there ain't no one else but you _can_ do it, captain.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, there is,\" said Bennett listlessly. \"Duane can--if he has\nluck. I know him. He's a good man. No, I'm out of it, Adler; I had my\nchance. It is somebody else's turn now. Do you want to go with Duane? I\ncan give you letters to him. He'd be glad to have you, I know.\"\n\nAdler started from his place.\n\n\"Why, do you think--\" he exclaimed vehemently--\"do you think I'd go with\nanybody else but you, sir? Oh, you will be going some of these days, I'm\nsure of it. We--we'll have another try at it, sir, before we die. We\nain't beaten yet.\"\n\n\"Yes, we are, Adler,\" returned Bennett, smiling calmly; \"we'll stay at\nhome now and write our book. But we'll let some one else reach the Pole.\nThat's not for us--never will be, Adler.\"\n\nAt the end of their talk some half-hour later Adler stood up, remarking:\n\n\"Guess I'd better be standing by if I'm to get the last train back to\nthe City to-night. They told me at the station that she'd clear about\nmidnight.\" Suddenly he began to show signs of uneasiness, turning his\ncap about between his fingers, changing his weight from foot to foot.\nThen at length:\n\n\"You wouldn't be wanting a man about the place, would you, sir?\" And\nbefore Bennett could reply he continued eagerly, \"I've been a bit of\nmost trades in my time, and I know how to take care of a garden like as\nyou have here; I'm a main good hand with plants and flower things, and I\ncould help around generally.\" Then, earnestly, \"Let me stay, sir--it\nwon't cost--I wouldn't think of taking a cent from you, captain. Just\nlet me act as your orderly for a spell, sir. I'd sure give satisfaction;\nwill you, sir--will you?\"\n\n\"Nonsense, Adler,\" returned Bennett; \"stay, if you like. I presume I can\nfind use for you. But you must be paid, of course.\"\n\n\"Not a soomarkee,\" protested the other almost indignantly.\n\nThe next day Adler brought his chest down from the City and took up his\nquarters with Bennett at Medford. Though Dr. Pitts had long since ceased\nto keep horses, the stable still adjoined the house, and Adler swung his\nhammock in the coachman's old room. Bennett could not induce him to room\nin the house itself. Adler prided himself that he knew his place. After\ntheir first evening's conversation he never spoke to Bennett until\nspoken to first, and the resumed relationship of commander and\nsubordinate was inexpressibly dear to him. It was something to see Adler\nwaiting on the table in the \"glass-room\" in his blue jersey, standing at\nattention at the door, happy in the mere sight of Bennett at his meals.\nIn the mornings, as soon as breakfast was ready, it was Adler's\nprivilege to announce the fact to Bennett, whom he usually found already\nat work upon his writing. Returning thence to the dining-room, Adler\nwaited for his lord to appear. As soon as he heard Bennett's step in the\nhall a little tremor of excitement possessed him. He ran to Bennett's\nchair, drawing it back for him, and as soon as Bennett had seated\nhimself circled about him with all the pride and solicitude of a\nmotherly hen. He opened his napkin for him, delivered him his paper, and\npushed his cup of coffee a half-inch nearer his hand. Throughout the\nduration of the meal he hardly took his eyes from Bennett's face,\nwatching his every movement with a glow of pride, his hands gently\nstroking one another in an excess of satisfaction and silent enjoyment.\n\nThe days passed; soon a fortnight was gone by. Drearily, mechanically,\nBennett had begun work upon his book, the narrative of the expedition.\nIt was repugnant to him. Long since he had lost all interest in polar\nexploration. As he had said to Adler, he was out of it, finally and\nirrevocably. His bolt was shot; his role upon the stage of the world was\nended. He only desired now to be forgotten as quickly as possible, to\nlapse into mediocrity as easily and quietly as he could. Fame was\nnothing to him now. The thundering applause of an entire world that had\nonce been his was mere noise, empty and meaningless. He did not care to\nreawaken it. The appearance of his book he knew was expected and waited\nfor in every civilised nation of the globe. It would be printed in\nlanguages whereof he was ignorant, but it was all one with him now.\n\nThe task of writing was hateful to him beyond expression, but with such\ndetermination as he could yet summon to his aid Bennett stuck to it,\neight, ten, and sometimes fourteen hours each day. In a way his\nnarrative was an atonement. Ferriss was its hero. Almost instinctively\nBennett kept the figure of himself, his own achievements, his own plans\nand ideas, in the background. On more than one page he deliberately\nascribed to Ferriss triumphs which no one but himself had attained. It\nwas Ferriss who was the leader, the victor to whom all laurels were due.\nIt was Ferriss whose example had stimulated the expedition to its best\nefforts in the darkest hours; it was, practically, Ferriss who had saved\nthe party after the destruction of the ship; whose determination,\nunbroken courage, endurance, and intelligence had pervaded all minds and\nhearts during the retreat to Kolyuchin Bay.\n\n\"Though nominally in command,\" wrote Bennett, \"I continually gave place\nto him. Without his leadership we should all, unquestionably, have\nperished before even reaching land. His resolution to conquer, at\nwhatever cost, was an inspiration to us all. Where he showed the way we\nhad to follow; his courage was never daunted, his hope was never dimmed,\nhis foresight, his intelligence, his ingenuity in meeting and dealing\nwith apparently unsolvable problems were nothing short of marvellous.\nHis was the genius of leadership. He was the explorer, born to his\nwork.\"\n\nOne day, just after luncheon, as Bennett, according to his custom, was\nwalking in the garden by the house, smoking a cigar before returning to\nhis work, he was surprised to find himself bleeding at the nose. It was\nbut a trifling matter, and passed off in a few moments, but the fact of\nits occurrence directed his attention to the state of his health, and he\ntold himself that for the last few days he had not been at all his\naccustomed self. There had been dull pains in his back and legs; more\nthan once his head had pained him, and of late the continuance of his\nwork had been growing steadily more obnoxious to him, the very physical\neffort of driving the pen from line to line was a burden.\n\n\"Hum!\" he said to himself later on in the day, when the bleeding at the\nnose returned upon him, \"I think we need a little quinine.\"\n\nBut the next day he found he could not eat, and all the afternoon,\nthough he held doggedly to his work, he was troubled with nausea. At\ntimes a great weakness, a relaxing of all the muscles, came over him. In\nthe evening he sent a note to Dr. Pitts's address in the City, asking\nhim to come down to Medford the next day.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOn the Monday morning of the following week, some two hours after\nbreakfast, Lloyd met Miss Douglass on the stairs, dressed for the street\nand carrying her nurse's bag.\n\n\"Are you going out?\" she asked of the fever nurse in some astonishment.\n\"Where are you going?\" for Lloyd had returned to duty, and it was her\nname that now stood at the top of the list; \"I thought it was my turn to\ngo out,\" she added.\n\nMiss Douglass was evidently much confused.\n\nHer meeting with Lloyd had apparently been unexpected. She halted upon\nthe stairs in great embarrassment, stammering:\n\n\"No--no, I'm on call. I--I was called out of my turn--specially\ncalled--that was it.\"\n\n\"Were you?\" demanded Lloyd sharply, for the other nurse was disturbed to\nan extraordinary degree.\n\n\"Well, then; no, I wasn't, but the superintendent--Miss Bergyn--she\nthought--she advised--you had better see her.\"\n\n\"I will see her,\" declared Lloyd, \"but don't you go till I find out why\nI was skipped.\"\n\nLloyd hurried at once to Miss Bergyn's room, indignant at this slight.\nSurely, after what had happened, she was entitled to more consideration\nthan this. Of all the staff in the house she should have been the one to\nbe preferred.\n\nMiss Bergyn rose at Lloyd's sudden entrance into her room, and to her\nquestion responded:\n\n\"It was only because I wanted to spare you further trouble and--and\nembarrassment, Lloyd, that I told Miss Douglass to take your place. This\ncall is from Medford. Dr. Pitts was here himself this morning, and he\nthought as I did.\"\n\n\"Thought what? I don't understand.\"\n\n\"It seemed to me,\" answered the superintendent nurse, \"that this one\ncase of all others would be the hardest, the most disagreeable for you\nto take. It seems that Mr. Bennett has leased Dr. Pitts's house from\nhim. He is there now. At the time when Mr. Ferriss was beginning to be\nill Mr. Bennett was with him a great deal and undertook to nurse him\ntill Dr. Pitts interfered and put a professional nurse on the case.\nSince then, too, the doctor has found out that Mr. Bennett has exposed\nhimself imprudently. At any rate, in some way he has contracted the same\ndisease and is rather seriously ill with it. Dr. Pitts wants us to send\nhim a nurse at once. It just happened that it was your turn, and I\nthought I had better skip your name and send Louise Douglass.\"\n\nLloyd sank into a chair, her hands falling limply in her lap. A frown of\nperplexity gathered on her forehead. But suddenly she exclaimed:\n\n\"I know--that's all as it may be; but all the staff know that it is my\nturn to go; everybody in the house knows who is on call. How will it\nbe--what will be thought when it is known that I haven't gone--and\nafter--after my failing once--after this--this other affair? No, I must\ngo. I, of all people, must go--and just because it is a typhoid case,\nlike the other.\"\n\n\"But, Lloyd, how _can_ you?\"\n\nTrue, how could she? Her patient would be the same man who had\nhumiliated her and broken her, had so cruelly misunderstood and wronged\nher, for whom all her love was dead. How could she face him again? Yet\nhow refuse to take the case? How explain a second failure to her\ncompanions? Lloyd made a little movement of distress, clasping her hands\ntogether. How the complications followed fast upon each other! No sooner\nwas one difficult situation met and disposed of than another presented\nitself. Bennett was nothing to her now, yet, for all that, she recoiled\ninstinctively from meeting him again. Not only must she meet him, but\nshe must be with him day after day, hour after hour, at his very side,\nin all the intimacy that the sick-room involved. On the other hand, how\ncould she decline this case? The staff might condone one apparent and\ninexplicable defection; another would certainly not be overlooked. But\nwas not this new situation a happy and unlooked-for opportunity to\nvindicate her impaired prestige in the eyes of her companions? Lloyd\nmade up her mind upon the instant. She rose.\n\n\"I shall take the case,\" she said.\n\nShe was not a little surprised at herself. Hardly an instant had she\nhesitated. On that other occasion when she had believed it right to make\nconfession to her associates it had been hard--at times almost\nimpossible--for her to do her duty as she saw and understood it. This\nnew complication was scarcely less difficult, but once having attained\nthe fine, moral rigour that had carried her through her former ordeal,\nit became easy now to do right under all or any circumstances, however\nadverse. If she had failed then, she certainly would have failed now.\nThat she had succeeded then made it all the easier to succeed now. Dimly\nLloyd commenced to understand that the mastery of self, the steady, firm\ncontrol of natural, intuitive impulses, selfish because natural, was a\nprogression. Each victory not only gained the immediate end in view, but\nbraced the mind and increased the force of will for the next shock, the\nnext struggle. She had imagined and had told herself that Bennett had\nbroken her strength for good. But was it really so? Had not defeat in\nthat case been only temporary? Was she not slowly getting back her\nstrength by an unflinching adherence to the simple, fundamental\nprinciples of right, and duty, and truth? Was not the struggle with\none's self the greatest fight of all, greater, far greater, than had\nbeen the conflict between Bennett's will and her own?\n\nWithin the hour she found herself once again on her way to Medford. How\nmuch had happened, through what changes had she passed since the\noccasion of her first journey; and Bennett, how he, too, changed; how\ndifferent he had come to stand in her estimation! Once the thought that\nhe was in danger had been a constant terror to her, and haunted her days\nand lurked at her side through many a waking night. Was it possible that\nnow his life or death was no more to her than that of any of her former\npatients? She could not say; she avoided answering the question.\nCertainly her heart beat no faster at this moment to know that he was in\nthe grip of a perilous disease. She told herself that her Bennett was\ndead already; that she was coming back to Medford not to care for and\nwatch over the individual, but to combat the disease.\n\nWhen she arrived at the doctor's house in Medford, a strange-looking man\nopened the door for her, and asked immediately if she was the nurse.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Lloyd, \"I am. Is Dr. Pitts here?\"\n\n\"Upstairs in his room,\" answered the other in a whisper, closing the\nfront door with infinite softness. \"He won't let me go in, the doctor\nwon't; I--I ain't seen him in four days. Ask the doctor if I can't just\nhave a blink at him--just a little blink through the crack of the door.\nJust think, Miss, I ain't seen him in four days! Just think of that! And\nlook here, they ain't giving him enough to eat--nothing but milk and\nchicken soup with rice in it. He never did like rice; that's no kind of\nrations for a sick man. I fixed him up a bit of duff yesterday, what he\nused to like so much aboard ship, and Pitts wouldn't let him have it. He\nregularly laughed in my face.\"\n\nLloyd sent word to the doctor by the housekeeper that she had arrived,\nand on going up found Pitts waiting for her at the door of the\nsick-room, not that which had been occupied by Ferriss, but another--the\nguest-chamber of the house, situated toward the rear of the building.\n\n\"Why, I expected Miss Douglass!\" exclaimed the doctor in a low voice as\nsoon as his eye fell upon Lloyd. \"Any one of them but you!\"\n\n\"I had to come,\" Lloyd answered quietly, flushing hotly for all that.\n\"It was my turn, and it was not right for me to stay away.\"\n\nThe doctor hesitated an instant, and then dismissed the subject, putting\nhis chin in the air as if to say that, after all, it was not his affair.\n\n\"Well,\" he said, \"it's queer to see how things will tangle themselves\nsometimes. I don't know whether he took this thing from Ferriss or not.\nBoth of them were exposed to the same conditions when their expedition\nwent to pieces and they were taken off by the whaling ships--bad water,\nweakened constitution, not much power of resistance; in prime condition\nfor the bacillus, and the same cause might have produced the same\neffect; at any rate, he's in a bad way.\"\n\n\"Is he--very bad?\" asked Lloyd.\n\n\"Well, he's not the hang-on sort that Mr. Ferriss was; nothing undecided\nabout Captain Ward Bennett; when he's sick, he's sick; rushes right at\nit like a blind bull. He's as bad now as Mr. Ferriss was in his third\nweek.\"\n\n\"Do you think he will recognise me?\"\n\nThe doctor shook his head. \"No; delirious most of the time--of\ncourse--regulation thing. If we don't keep the fever down he'll go out\nsure. That's the danger in his case. Look at him yourself; here he is.\nThe devil! The animal is sitting up again.\"\n\nAs Lloyd entered the room she saw Bennett sitting bolt upright in his\nbed, staring straight before him, his small eyes, with their deforming\ncast, open to their fullest extent, the fingers of his shrunken, bony\nhands dancing nervously on the coverlet. A week's growth of stubble\nblackened the lower part of his face. Without a moment's pause he\nmumbled and muttered with astonishing rapidity, but for the most part\nthe words were undistinguishable. It was, indeed, not the same Bennett,\nLloyd had last seen. The great body was collapsed upon itself; the skin\nof the face was like dry, brown parchment, and behind it the big,\nmassive bones stood out in great knobs and ridges. It needed but a\nglance to know that here was a man dangerously near to his death. While\nLloyd was removing her hat and preparing herself for her work the doctor\ngot Bennett upon his back again and replenished the ice-pack about his\nhead.\n\n\"Not much strength left in our friend now,\" he murmured.\n\n\"How long has he been like this?\" asked Lloyd as she arranged the\ncontents of her nurse's bag on a table near the window.\n\n\"Pretty close to eight hours now. He was conscious yesterday morning,\nhowever, for a little while, and wanted to know what his chances were.\"\n\nThey were neither good nor many; the strength once so formidable was\nebbing away like a refluent tide, and that with ominous swiftness.\nStimulate the life as the doctor would, strive against the enemy's\nadvance as Lloyd might, Bennett continued to sink.\n\n\"The devil of it is,\" muttered the doctor, \"that he don't seem to care.\nHe had as soon give up as not. It's hard to save a patient that don't\nwant to save himself. If he'd fight for his life as he did in the\narctic, we could pull him through yet. Otherwise--\" he shrugged his\nshoulders almost helplessly.\n\nThe next night toward nine o'clock Lloyd took the doctor's place at\ntheir patient's bedside, and Pitts, without taking off his clothes,\nstretched himself out upon the sofa in one of the rooms on the lower\nfloor of the house, with the understanding that the nurse was to call\nhim in case of any change.\n\nBut as the doctor was groping his way down the darkened stairway he\nstumbled against Adler and Kamiska. Adler was sitting on one of the\nsteps, and the dog was on her haunches close at his side; the two were\nhuddled together there in the dark, broad awake, shoulder to shoulder,\nwaiting, watching, and listening for the faint sounds that came at long\nintervals from the direction of the room where Bennett lay.\n\nAs the physician passed him Adler stood up and saluted:\n\n\"Is he doing any better now, sir?\" he whispered.\n\n\"Nothing new,\" returned the other brusquely. \"He may get well in three\nweeks' time or he may die before midnight; so there you are. You know as\nmuch about it as I do. Damn that dog!\"\n\nHe trod upon Kamiska, who forbore heroically to yelp, and went on his\nway. Adler resumed his place on the stairs, sitting down gingerly, so\nthat the boards should not creak under his weight. He took Kamiska's\nhead between his hands and rocked himself gently to and fro.\n\n\"What are we going to do, little dog?\" he whispered. \"What are we going\nto do if--if our captain should--if he shouldn't--\" he had no words to\nfinish. Kamiska took her place again by his side, and the two resumed\ntheir vigil.\n\nMeanwhile, not fifty feet away, a low voice, monotonous and rapid, was\nkeeping up a continuous, murmuring flow of words.\n\n\"That's well your number two sledge. All hands on the McClintock\nnow. You've got to do it, men. Forward, get forward, get forward;\nget on to the south, always to the south--south, south, south!...\nThere, there's the ice again. That's the biggest ridge yet. At it\nnow! Smash through; I'll break you yet; believe me, I will! There,\nwe broke it! I knew you could, men. I'll pull you through. Now,\nthen, h'up your other sledge. Forward! There will be double rations\nto-night all round--no--half-rations, quarter-rations.... No,\nthree-fifths of an ounce of dog-meat and a spoonful of alcohol--that's\nall; that's all, men. Pretty cold night, this--minus thirty-eight.\nOnly a quarter of a mile covered to-day. Everybody suffering in their\nfeet, and so weak--and starving--and freezing.\" All at once the voice\nbecame a wail. \"My God! is it never going to end?... Sh--h, steady,\nwhat was that? Who whimpered? Was that Ward Bennett? No whimpering,\nwhatever comes. Stick it out like men, anyway. Fight it out till we\ndrop, but no whimpering.... Who said there were steam whalers off\nthe floe? That's a lie! Forward, forward, get forward to the\nsouth--no, not the south; to the _north_, to the north! We'll reach\nit, we'll succeed; we're most there, men; come on, come on! I tell\nyou this time we'll reach it; one more effort, men! We're most\nthere! What's the latitude? Eighty-five-twenty--eighty-six.\" The\nvoice began to grow louder: \"Come on, men; we're most there!\nEighty-seven--eighty-eight--eighty-nine-twenty-five!\" He rose to a\nsitting position. \"Eighty-nine-thirty--eighty-nine-forty-five.\" Suddenly\nthe voice rose to a shout. \"Ninety degrees! _By God, it's the Pole!_\"\n\nThe voice died away to indistinct mutterings.\n\nLloyd was at the bedside by now, and quietly pressed Bennett down upon\nhis back. But as she did so a thrill of infinite pity and compassion\nquivered through her. She had forced him down so easily. He was so\npitifully weak. Woman though she was, she could, with one small hand\nupon his breast, control this man who at one time had been of such\ncolossal strength--such vast physical force.\n\nSuddenly Bennett began again. \"Where's Ferriss? Where's Richard Ferriss?\nWhere's the chief engineer of the Freja Arctic Exploring Expedition?\"\n\nHe fell silent again, and but for the twitching, dancing hands, lay\nquiet. Then he cried:\n\n\"Attention to the roll-call!\"\n\nRapidly and in a low voice he began calling off the muster of the\nFreja's men and officers, giving the answers himself.\n\n\"Adler--here; Blair--here; Dahl--here; Fishbaugh--here; Hawes--here;\nMcPherson--here; Muck Tu--here; Woodward--here; Captain Ward\nBennett--here; Dr. Sheridan Dennison--here; Chief Engineer Richard\nFerriss--\" no answer. Bennett waited for a moment, then repeated the\nname, \"Chief Engineer Richard Ferriss--\" Again he was silent; but after\na few seconds he called aloud in agony of anxiety, \"Chief Engineer\nRichard Ferriss, answer to the roll-call!\"\n\nThen once more he began; his disordered wits calling to mind a different\norder of things:\n\n\"Adler--here; Blair--died from exhaustion at Point Kane; Dahl--here;\nFishbaugh--starved to death on the march to Kolyuchin Bay; Hawes--died\nof arctic fever at Cape Kammeni; McPherson--unable to keep up, and\nabandoned at ninth camp; Muck Tu--here; Woodward--died from starvation\nat twelfth camp; Dr. Sheridan Dennison--frozen to death at Kolyuchin\nBay; Chief Engineer Richard Ferriss--died by the act of his best friend,\nCaptain Ward Bennett!\" Again and again Bennett repeated this phrase,\ncalling: \"Richard Ferriss! Richard Ferriss!\" and immediately adding in a\nbroken voice: \"Died by the act of his best friend, Captain Ward\nBennett.\" Or at times it was only the absence of Ferriss that seemed to\ntorture him. He would call the roll, answering \"here\" to each name until\nhe reached Ferriss; then he would not respond, but instead would cry\naloud over and over again, in accents of the bitterest grief, \"Richard\nFerriss, answer to the roll-call; Richard Ferriss, answer to the\nroll-call--\" Then suddenly, with a feeble, quavering cry, \"For God's\nsake, Dick, answer to the roll-call!\"\n\nThe hours passed. Ten o'clock struck, then eleven. At midnight Lloyd\ntook the temperature (which had decreased considerably) and the pulse,\nand refilled the ice-pack about the head. Bennett was still muttering in\nthe throes of delirium, still calling for Ferriss, imploring him to\nanswer to the roll-call; or repeating the words: \"Dick Ferriss, chief\nengineer--died at the hands of his best friend, Ward Bennett,\" in tones\nso pitiful, so heart-broken that more than once Lloyd felt the tears\nrunning down her cheeks.\n\n\"Richard Ferriss, Richard Ferriss, answer to the roll-call; Dick, old\nman, won't you answer, won't you answer, old chap, when I call you?\nWon't you come back and say 'It's all right?' Ferriss, Ferriss, answer\nto my roll-call. ... Died at the hands of his best friend. ... At\nKolyuchin Bay. ... Killed, and I did it. ... Forward, men; you've got to\ndo it; snowing to-day and all the ice in motion. ... H'up y'r other\nsledge. Come on with y'r number four; more pressure-ridges, I'll break\nyou yet! Come on with y'r number four! ... Lloyd Searight, what are you\ndoing in this room?\"\n\nOn the instant the voice had changed from confused mutterings to\ndistinct, clear-cut words. The transition was so sudden that Lloyd, at\nthe moment busy at her nurse's bag, her back to the bed, wheeled sharply\nabout to find Bennett sitting bolt upright, looking straight at her with\nintelligent, wide-open eyes. Lloyd's heart for an instant stood still,\nalmost in terror. This sudden leap back from the darkness of delirium\ninto the daylight of consciousness was almost like a rising from the\ndead, ghost-like, appalling. She caught her breath, trembling in spite\nof her best efforts, and for an instant leaned a hand upon the table\nbehind her.\n\nBut on Bennett's face, ghastly, ravaged by disease, with its vast,\nprotruding jaw, its narrow contracted forehead and unkempt growth of\nbeard, the dawning of intelligence and surprise swiftly gave place to an\nexpression of terrible anxiety and apprehension.\n\n\"What are you doing here, Lloyd?\" he cried.\n\n\"Hush!\" she answered quickly as she came forward; \"above all things you\nmust not sit up; lie down again and don't talk. You are very sick.\"\n\n\"I know, I know,\" he answered feebly. \"I know what it is. But you must\nleave here. It's a terrible risk every moment you stay in this room. I\nwant you to go. You understand--at once! Call the doctor. Don't come\nnear the bed,\" he went on excitedly, struggling to keep himself from\nsinking back upon the pillows. His breath was coming quick; his eyes\nwere flashing. All the poor, shattered senses were aroused and quivering\nwith excitement and dread.\n\n\"It will kill you to stay here,\" he continued, almost breathless. \"Out\nof this room!\" he commanded. \"Out of this house! It is mine now; I'm the\nmaster here--do you understand? Don't!\" he exclaimed as Lloyd put her\nhands upon his shoulders to force him to lie down again.\n\n\"Don't, don't touch me! Stand away from me!\"\n\nHe tried to draw back from her in the bed. Then suddenly he made a great\neffort to rise, resisting her efforts.\n\n\"I shall put you out, then,\" he declared, struggling against Lloyd's\nclasp upon his shoulders, catching at her wrists. His excitement was so\nintense, his fervour so great that it could almost be said he touched\nthe edge of his delirium again.\n\n\"Do you hear, do you hear? Out of this room!\"\n\n\"No,\" said Lloyd calmly; \"you must be quiet; you must try to go to\nsleep. This time you cannot make me leave.\"\n\nHe caught her by one arm, and, bracing himself with the other against\nthe headboard of the bed, thrust her back from him with all his might.\n\n\"Keep away from me, I tell you; keep back! You shall do as I say! I have\nalways carried my point, and I shall not fail now. Believe me, I shall\nnot. You--you--\" he panted as he struggled with her, ashamed of his\nweakness, humiliated beyond words that she should know it. \"I--you\nshall--you will compel me to use force. Don't let it come to that.\"\n\nCalmly Lloyd took both his wrists in the strong, quiet clasp of one\npalm, and while she supported his shoulders with her other arm, laid him\ndown among the pillows again as though he had been a child.\n\n\"I'm--I'm a bit weak and trembly just now,\" he admitted, panting with\nhis exertion; \"but, Lloyd, listen. I know how you must dislike me now,\nbut will you please go--go, go at once!\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\nWhat a strange spinning of the wheel of fate was here! In so short a\ntime had their mutual positions been reversed. Now it was she who was\nstrong and he who was weak. It was she who conquered and he who was\nsubdued. It was she who triumphed and he who was humiliated. It was he\nwho implored and she who denied. It was her will and no longer his that\nmust issue victorious from the struggle.\n\nAnd how complete now was Bennett's defeat! The very contingency he had\nfought so desperately to avert and for which he had sacrificed\nFerriss--Lloyd's care of so perilous a disease--behold! the mysterious\nturn of the wheel had brought it about, and now he was powerless to\nresist.\n\n\"Oh!\" he cried, \"have I not enough upon my mind already--Ferriss and his\ndeath? Are you going to make me imperil your life too, and after I have\ntried so hard? You must not stay here.\"\n\n\"I shall stay,\" she answered.\n\n\"I order you to go. This is my house. Send the doctor here. Where's\nAdler?\" Suddenly he fainted.\n\nAn hour or two later, in the gray of the morning, at a time when Bennett\nwas sleeping quietly under the influence of opiates, Lloyd found herself\nsitting at the window in front of the small table there, her head\nresting on her hand, thoughtful, absorbed, and watching with but\nhalf-seeing eyes the dawn growing pink over the tops of the apple-trees\nin the orchard near by.\n\nThe window was open just wide enough for the proper ventilation of the\nroom. For a long time she sat thus without moving, only from time to\ntime smoothing back the heavy, bronze-red hair from her temples and\nears. By degrees the thinking faculties of her brain, as it were, a\nmyriad of delicate interlacing wheels, slowly decreased in the rapidity\nand intensity of their functions. She began to feel instead of to think.\nAs the activity of her mind lapsed to a certain pleasant numbness, a\nvague, formless, nameless emotion seemed to be welling to the surface.\nIt was no longer a question of the brain. What then? Was it the heart?\nShe gave no name to this new emotion; it was too confused as yet, too\nundefinable. A certain great sweetness seemed to be coming upon her, but\nshe could not say whether she was infinitely sad or supremely happy; a\nsmile was on her lips, and yet the tears began to brim in her dull-blue\neyes.\n\nShe felt as if some long, fierce struggle, or series of struggles, were\nat last accomplished; as if for a long period of time she had been\ninvolved in the maze and tortuous passages of some gloomy cavern, but at\nlength, thence issuing, had again beheld the stars. A great tenderness,\na certain tremulous joy in all things that were true and good and right,\ngrew big and strong within her; the delight in living returned to her.\nThe dawn was brightening and flushing over all the world, and colour,\nlight, and warmth were coming back into her life. The night had been\nstill and mild, but now the first breath of the morning breeze stirred\nin the trees, in the grass, in the flowers, and the thick, dew-drenched\nbushes along the roadside, and a delicious aroma of fields and woods and\ngardens came to her. The sweetness of life and the sweetness of those\nthings better than life and more enduring, the things that do not fail,\nnor cease, nor vanish away, suddenly entered into that room and\ndescended upon her almost in the sense of a benediction, a visitation,\nsomething mystic and miraculous. It was a moment to hope all things, to\nbelieve all things, to endure all things.\n\nShe caught her breath, listening--for what she did not know. Once again,\njust as it had been in that other dawn, in that other room where the\nEnemy had been conquered, the sense of some great happiness was in the\nair, was coming to her swiftly. But now the greater Enemy had been\noutfought, the morning of a greater day was breaking and spreading, and\nthe greatest happiness in the world was preparing for her. How it had\nhappened she did not know. Now was not the moment to think, to reason,\nto reflect. It seemed as though the rushing of wings was all about her,\nas though a light brighter than the day was just about to break upon her\nsight, as though a music divinely beautiful was just about to burst upon\nher ear. But the light was not for her eye; the music was not for her\near. The radiance and the harmony came from herself, from within her.\nThe intellect was numb. Only the heart was alive on this wonderful\nmidsummer's morning, and it was in her heart that the radiance shone and\nthe harmony vibrated. Back in his place once more, high on his throne,\nthe love that she believed had forever departed from her sat exalted and\ntriumphant, singing to the cadence of that unheard music, shining and\nmagnificent in the glory of that new-dawned light.\n\nWould Bennett live? Suddenly that question leaped up in her mind and\nstood in the eye of her imagination, terrible, menacing--a hideous, grim\nspectre, before which Lloyd quailed with failing heart and breath. The\nlight, the almost divine radiance that had burst upon her, nevertheless\nthrew a dreadful shadow before it. Beneath the music she heard the growl\nof the thunder. Her new-found happiness was not without its accompanying\ndismay. Love had not returned to her heart alone. With it had returned\nthe old Enemy she had once believed had left her forever. Now it had\ncome back. As before, it lurked and leered at her from dark corners. It\ncrept to her side, to her back, ready to leap, ready to strike, to\nclutch at her throat with cold fingers and bear her to the earth,\nrending her heart with a grief she told herself she could not endure and\nlive. She loved him now with all her mind and might; how could it ever\nhave been otherwise? He belonged to her--and she? Why, she only lived\nwith his life; she seemed so bound to him as to be part of his very\nself. Literally, she could not understand how it would be possible for\nher to live if he should die. It seemed to her that with his death some\nmysterious element of her life, something vital and fundamental, for\nwhich there was no name, would disintegrate upon the instant and leave\nher without the strength necessary for further existence. But this\nwould, however, be a relief. The prospect of the years after his death,\nthe fearful loneliness of life without him, was a horror before which\nshe veritably believed her reason itself must collapse.\n\n\"Lloyd.\"\n\nBennett was awake again and watching her with feverish anxiety from\nwhere he lay among the pillows. \"Lloyd,\" he repeated, the voice once so\ndeep and powerful quavering pitifully. \"I was wrong. I don't want you to\ngo. Don't leave me.\"\n\nIn an instant Lloyd was at his side, kneeling by the bed. She caught one\nof the great, gnarled hands, seamed and corded and burning with the\nfever. \"Never, never, dearest; never so long as I shall live.\"\n\n\n\n\nIX.\n\n\nWhen Adler heard Bennett's uncertain steps upon the stairs and the sound\nof Lloyd's voice speaking to him and urging that there was no hurry, and\nthat he was to take but one step at a time, he wheeled swiftly about\nfrom the windows of the glass-room, where he had been watching the\nOctober breeze stirring the crimson and yellow leaves in the orchard,\nand drew back his master's chair from the breakfast table and stood\nbehind it expectantly, his eyes watching the door.\n\nLloyd held back the door, and Bennett came in, leaning heavily on Dr.\nPitts's shoulder. Adler stiffened upon the instant as if in answer to\nsome unheard bugle-call, and when Bennett had taken his seat, pushed his\nchair gently to the table and unfolded his napkin with a flourish as\nthough giving a banner to the wind. Pitts almost immediately left the\nroom, but Lloyd remained supervising Bennett's breakfast, pouring his\nmilk, buttering his toast, and opening his eggs.\n\n\"Coffee?\" suddenly inquired Bennett. Lloyd shook her head.\n\n\"Not for another week.\"\n\nBennett looked with grim disfavour upon the glass of milk that Lloyd had\nplaced at his elbow.\n\n\"Such slop!\" he growled. \"Why not a little sugar and warm water, and be\ndone with it? Lloyd, I can't drink this stuff any more. Why, it's warm\nyet!\" he exclaimed aggrievedly and with deep disgust, abruptly setting\ndown the glass.\n\n\"Why, of course it is,\" she answered; \"we brought the cow here\nespecially for you, and the boy has just done milking her--and it's not\nslop.\"\n\n\"Slop! slop!\" declared Bennett. He picked up the glass again and looked\nat her over the rim.\n\n\"I'll drink this stuff this one more time to please you,\" he said. \"But\nI promise you this will be the last time. You needn't ask me again. I\nhave drunk enough milk the past three weeks to support a foundling\nhospital for a year.\"\n\nInvariably, since the period of his convalescence began, Bennett made\nthis scene over his hourly glass of milk, and invariably it ended by his\ngulping it down at nearly a single swallow.\n\nAdler brought in the mail and the morning paper. Three letters had come\nfor Lloyd, and for Bennett a small volume on \"Recent Arctic Research and\nExploration,\" sent by his publisher with a note to the effect that, as\nthe latest authority on the subject, Bennett was sure to find it of\ngreat interest. In an appendix, inserted after the body of the book had\nbeen made up, the Freja expedition and his own work were briefly\ndescribed. Lloyd put her letters aside, and, unfolding the paper, said,\n\"I'll read it while you eat your breakfast. Have you everything you\nwant? Did you drink your milk--all of it?\" But out of the corner of her\neye she noted that Adler was chuckling behind the tray that he held to\nhis face, and with growing suspicion she leaned forward and peered about\namong the breakfast things. Bennett had hidden his glass behind the\ntoast-rack.\n\n\"And it's only two-thirds empty,\" she declared. \"Ward, why will you be\nsuch a boy?\"\n\n\"Oh, well,\" he grumbled, and without more ado drank off the balance.\n\n\"Now I'll read to you if you have everything you want. Adler, I think\nyou can open one of those windows; it's so warm out of doors.\"\n\nWhile he ate his breakfast of toast, milk, and eggs Lloyd skimmed\nthrough the paper, reading aloud everything she thought would be of\ninterest to him. Then, after a moment, her eye was caught and held by a\nhalf-column article expanded from an Associated Press despatch.\n\n\"Oh!\" she cried, \"listen to this!\" and continued: \"'Word has been\nreceived at this place of the safe arrival of the arctic steamship\nCurlew at Tasiusak, on the Greenland coast, bearing eighteen members of\nthe Duane-Parsons expedition. Captain Duane reports all well and an\nuneventful voyage. It is his intention to pass the winter at Tasiusak,\ncollecting dogs and also Esquimau sledges, which he believes superior to\nEuropean manufacture for work in rubble-ice, and to push on with the\nCurlew in the spring as soon as Smith Sound shall be navigable. This may\nbe later than Captain Duane supposes, as the whalers who have been\nworking in the sound during the past months bring back news of an\nunusually early winter and extraordinary quantities of pack-ice both in\nthe sound itself and in Kane Basin. This means a proportionately late\nopen season next year, and the Curlew's departure from Tasiusak may be\nconsiderably later than anticipated. It is considered by the best arctic\nexperts an unfortunate circumstance that Captain Duane elected to winter\nsouth of Cape Sabine, as the condition of the ice in Smith Sound can\nnever be relied upon nor foretold. Should the entrance to the sound\nstill be encumbered with ice as late as July, which is by no means\nimpossible, Captain Duane will be obliged to spend another winter at\nTasiusak or Upernvick, consuming alike his store of provisions and the\npatience of his men.'\"\n\nThere was a silence when Lloyd finished reading. Bennett chipped at the\nend of his second egg.\n\n\"Well?\" she said at length.\n\n\"Well,\" returned Bennett, \"what's all that to me?\"\n\n\"It's your work,\" she answered almost vehemently.\n\n\"No, indeed. It's Duane's work.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"Let him try now.\"\n\n\"And you?\" exclaimed Lloyd, looking intently at him.\n\n\"My dear girl, I had my chance and failed. Now--\" he raised a shoulder\nindifferently--\"now, I don't care much about it. I've lost interest.\"\n\n\"I don't believe you,\" she cried energetically; \"you of all men.\" Behind\nBennett's chair she had a momentary glimpse of Adler, who had tucked his\ntray under his arm and was silently applauding in elaborate pantomime.\nShe saw his lips form the words \"That's it; that's right. Go right\nahead.\"\n\n\"Besides, I have my book to do, and, besides that, I'm an invalid--an\ninvalid who drinks slop.\"\n\n\"And you intend to give it all up--your career?\"\n\n\"Well--if I should, what then?\" Suddenly he turned to her abruptly. \"I\nshould not think _you_ would want me to go again. Do _you_ urge me to\ngo?\"\n\nLloyd made a sudden little gasp, and her hand involuntarily closed upon\nhis as it rested near her on the table.\n\n\"Oh, no!\" she cried. \"Oh, no, I don't! You are right. It's not your work\nnow.\"\n\n\"Well, then,\" muttered Bennett as though the question was forever\nsettled.\n\nLloyd turned to her mail, and one after another slit the envelopes,\nwoman fashion, with a shell hairpin. But while she was glancing over the\ncontents of her letters Bennett began to stir uneasily in his place.\nFrom time to time he stopped eating and shot a glance at Lloyd from\nunder his frown, noting the crisp, white texture of her gown and waist,\nthe white scarf with its high, tight bands about the neck, the tiny,\ngolden buttons in her cuffs, the sombre, ruddy glow of her cheeks, her\ndull-blue eyes, and the piles and coils of her bronze-red hair. Then,\nabruptly, he said:\n\n\"Adler, you can go.\"\n\nAdler saluted and withdrew.\n\n\"Whom are your letters from?\" Bennett demanded by way of a beginning.\n\nLloyd replaced the hairpin in her hair, answering:\n\n\"From Dr. Street, from Louise Douglass, and from--Mr. Campbell.\"\n\n\"Hum! well, what do they say? Dr. Street and--Louise Douglass?\"\n\n\"Dr. Street asks me to take a very important surgical case as soon as I\nget through here, 'one of the most important and delicate, as well as\none of the most interesting, operations in his professional experience.'\nThose are his words. Louise writes four pages, but she says nothing;\njust chatters.\"\n\n\"And Campbell?\" Bennett indicated with his chin the third rather\nvoluminous letter at Lloyd's elbow. \"He seems to have written rather\nmore than four pages. What does he say? Does he 'chatter' too?\"\n\nLloyd smoothed back her hair from one temple.\n\n\"H'm--no. He says--something. But never mind what he says. Ward, I must\nbe going back to the City. You don't need a nurse any more.\"\n\n\"What's that?\" Bennett's frown gathered on the instant, and with a sharp\nmovement of the head that was habitual to him he brought his one good\neye to bear upon her.\n\nLloyd repeated her statement, answering his remonstrance and\nexpostulation with:\n\n\"You are almost perfectly well, and it would not be at all--discreet for\nme to stay here an hour longer than absolutely necessary. I shall go\nback to-morrow or next day.\"\n\n\"But, I tell you, I am still very sick. I'm a poor, miserable, shattered\nwreck.\"\n\nHe made a great show of coughing in hollow, lamentable tones.\n\n\"Listen to that, and last night I had a high fever, and this morning I\nhad a queer sort of pain about here--\" he vaguely indicated the region\nof his chest. \"I think I am about to have a relapse.\"\n\n\"Nonsense! You can't frighten me at all.\"\n\n\"Oh, well,\" he answered easily, \"I shall go with you--that is all. I\nsuppose you want to see me venture out in such raw, bleak weather as\nthis--with my weak lungs.\"\n\n\"Your weak lungs? How long since?\"\n\n\"Well, I--I've sometimes thought my lungs were not very strong.\"\n\n\"Why, dear me, you poor thing; I suppose the climate at Kolyuchin Bay\n_was_ a trifle too bracing--\"\n\n\"What does Campbell say?\"\n\n\"--and the diet too rich for your blood--\"\n\n\"What does Campbell say?\"\n\n\"--and perhaps you did overexert--\"\n\n\"Lloyd Searight, what does Mr. Campbell say in that--\"\n\n\"He asks me to marry him.\"\n\n\"To mum--mar--marry him? Well, damn his impudence!\"\n\n\"Mr. Campbell is an eminently respectable and worthy gentleman.\"\n\n\"Oh, well, I don't care. Go! Go, marry Mr. Campbell. Be happy. I forgive\nyou both. Go, leave me to die alone.\"\n\n\"Sir, I will go. Forget that you ever knew an unhappy wom--female, whose\nonly fault was that she loved you.\"\n\n\"Go! and sometimes think of me far away on the billow and drop a silent\ntear--I say, how are you going to answer Campbell's letter?\"\n\n\"Just one word--'_Come_.'\"\n\n\"Lloyd, be serious. This is no joke.\"\n\n\"Joke!\" she repeated hollowly. \"It is, indeed, a sorry joke. Ah! had I\nbut loved with a girlish love, it would have been better for me.\"\n\nThen suddenly she caught him about the neck with both her arms, and\nkissed him on the cheek and on the lips, a little quiver running through\nher to her finger-tips, her mood changing abruptly to a deep, sweet\nearnestness.\n\n\"Oh, Ward, Ward!\" she cried, \"all our unhappiness and all our sorrow and\ntrials and anxiety and cruel suspense are over now, and now we really\nhave each other and love each other, dear, and all the years to come are\nonly going to bring happiness to us, and draw us closer and nearer to\neach other.\"\n\n\"But here's a point, Lloyd,\" said Bennett after a few moments and when\nthey had returned to coherent speech; \"how about your work? You talk\nabout my career; what about yours? We are to be married, but I know just\nhow you have loved your work. It will be a hard wrench for you if you\ngive that up. I am not sure that I should ask it of you. This letter of\nStreet's, now. I know just how eager you must be to take charge of such\noperations--such important cases as he mentions. It would be very\nselfish of me to ask you to give up your work. It's your life-work, your\nprofession, your career.\"\n\nLloyd took up Dr. Street's letter, and, holding it delicately at arm's\nlength, tore it in two and let the pieces flutter to the floor.\n\n\"That, for my life-work,\" said Lloyd Searight.\n\nAs she drew back from him an instant later Bennett all at once and very\nearnestly demanded:\n\n\"Lloyd, do you love me?\"\n\n\"With all my heart, Ward.\"\n\n\"And you will be my wife?\"\n\n\"You know that I will.\"\n\n\"Then\"--Bennett picked up the little volume of \"Arctic Research\" which\nhe had received that morning, and tossed it from him upon the\nfloor--\"that, for my career,\" he answered.\n\nFor a moment they were silent, looking gladly into each other's eyes.\nThen Bennett drew her to him again and held her close to him, and once\nmore she put her arms around his neck and nestled her head down upon his\nshoulder with a little comfortable sigh of contentment and relief and\nquiet joy, for that the long, fierce trial was over; that there were no\nmore fights to be fought, no more grim, hard situations to face, no more\nrelentless duties to be done. She had endured and she had prevailed; now\nher reward was come. Now for the long, calm years of happiness.\n\nLater in the day, about an hour after noon, Bennett took his daily nap,\ncarefully wrapped in shawls and stretched out in a wicker steamer-chair\nin the glass-room. Lloyd, in the meantime, was busy in the garden at the\nside of the house, gathering flowers which she intended to put in a huge\nchina bowl in Bennett's room. While she was thus occupied Adler,\nfollowed by Kamiska, came up. Adler pulled off his cap.\n\n\"I beg pardon, Miss,\" he began, turning his cap about between his\nfingers. \"I don't want to seem to intrude, and if I do I just guess\nyou'd better tell me so first off. But what did he say--or did he say\nanything--the captain, I mean--this morning about going up again? I\nheard you talking to him at breakfast. That's it, that's the kind of\ntalk he needs. I can't talk that talk to him. I'm so main scared of him.\nI wouldn't 'a' believed the captain would ever say he'd give up, would\never say he was beaten. But, Miss, I'm thinking as there's something\nwrong, main wrong with the captain these days besides fever. He's\ngetting soft--that's what he is. If you'd only know the man that he\nwas--before--while we was up there in the Ice! That's his work, that's\nwhat he's cut out for. There ain't nobody can do it but him, and to see\nhim quit, to see him chuck up his chance to a third-rate ice-pilot like\nDuane--a coastwise college professor that don't know no more about Ice\nthan--than you do--it regularly makes me sick. Why, what will become of\nthe captain now if he quits? He'll just settle down to an ordinary\nstay-at-home, write-in-a-book professor, and write articles for the\npapers and magazines, and bye-and-bye, maybe, he'll get down to\nlecturing! Just fancy, Miss, him, the captain, lecturing! And while he\nstays at home and writes, and--oh, Lord!--lectures, somebody else,\nwithout a fifth of his ability, will do the _work_. It'll just naturally\nbreak my heart, it will!\" exclaimed Adler, \"if the captain chucks. I\nwouldn't be so main sorry that he won't reach the Pole as that he quit\ntrying--as that a man like the captain--or like what I thought he\nwas--gave up and chucked when he could win.\"\n\n\"But, Adler,\" returned Lloyd, \"the captain--Mr. Bennett, it seems to me,\nhas done his share. Think what he's been through. You can't have\nforgotten the march to Kolyuchin Bay?\"\n\nBut Adler made an impatient gesture with the hand that held the cap.\n\"The danger don't figure; what he'd have to go through with don't\nfigure; the chances of life or death don't figure; nothing in the world\ndon't figure. _It's his work_; God A'mighty cut him out for that, and\nhe's got to do it. Ain't you got any influence with him, Miss? Won't you\ntalk good talk to him? Don't let him chuck; don't let him get soft. Make\nhim be a Man and not a professor.\"\n\nWhen Adler had left her Lloyd sank into a little seat at the edge of the\ngarden walk, and let the flowers drop into her lap, and leaned back in\nher place, wide-eyed and thoughtful, reviewing in her imagination the\nevents of the past few months. What a change that summer had brought to\nboth of them; how they had been shaped anew in the mould of\ncircumstance!\n\nSuddenly and without warning, they two, high-spirited, strong,\ndetermined, had clashed together, the man's force against the woman's\nstrength; and the woman, inherently weaker, had been crushed and\nhumbled. For a time it seemed to her that she had been broken beyond\nhope; so humbled that she could never rise again; as though a great\ncrisis had developed in her life, and that, having failed once, she must\nfail again, and again, and again--as if her whole subsequent life must\nbe one long failure. But a greater crisis had followed hard upon the\nheels of the first--the struggle with self, the greatest struggle of\nall. Against the abstract principle of evil the woman who had failed in\nthe material conflict with a masculine, masterful will, had succeeded,\nhad conquered self, had been true when it was easy to be false, had\ndared the judgment of her peers so only that she might not deceive.\n\nHer momentary, perhaps fancied, hatred of Bennett, who had so cruelly\nmisunderstood and humiliated her, had apparently, of its own accord,\ndeparted from her heart. Then had come the hour when the strange hazard\nof fortune had reversed their former positions, when she could be\nmasterful while he was weak; when it was the man's turn to be broken, to\nbe prevailed against. Her own discomfiture had been offset by his. She\nno longer need look to him as her conqueror, her master. And when she\nhad seen him so weak, so pathetically unable to resist the lightest\npressure of her hand; when it was given her not only to witness but to\nrelieve his suffering, the great love for him that could not die had\nreturned. With the mastery of self had come the forgetfulness of self;\nand her profession, her life-work, of which she had been so proud, had\nseemed to her of small concern. Now she was his, and his life was hers.\nShe should--so she told herself--be henceforward happy in his happiness,\nand her only pride would be the pride in his achievements.\n\nBut now the unexpected had happened, and Bennett had given up his\ncareer. During the period of Bennett's convalescence Lloyd had often\ntalked long and earnestly with him, and partly from what he had told her\nand partly from much that she inferred she had at last been able to\ntrace out and follow the mental processes and changes through which\nBennett had passed. He, too, had been proved by fire; he, too, had had\nhis ordeal, his trial.\n\nBy nature, by training, and by virtue of the life he lived Bennett had\nbeen a man, harsh, somewhat brutal, inordinately selfish, and at all\ntimes magnificently arrogant. He had neither patience nor toleration for\nnatural human weakness. While selfish, he was not self-conscious, and it\nnever occurred to him, it was impossible for him to see that he was a\ngiant among men. His heart was callous; his whole nature and character\nhard and flinty from the buffetings he gave rather than received.\n\nThen had come misfortune. Ferriss had died, and Bennett's recognition\nand acknowledgment of the fact that he, Ward Bennett, who never failed,\nwho never blundered, had made at last the great and terrible error of\nhis life, had shaken his character to its very foundations. This was\nonly the beginning; the breach once made, Humanity entered into the\ngloomy, waste places of his soul; remorse crowded hard upon his wonted\narrogance; generosity and the impulse to make amends took the place of\nselfishness; kindness thrust out the native brutality; the old-time\nharshness and imperiousness gave way to a certain spirit of toleration.\n\nIt was the influence of these new emotions that had moved Bennett to\nmake the statement to Adler that had so astonished and perplexed his\nold-time subordinate. He, Bennett, too, like Lloyd, was at that time\nendeavouring to free himself from a false position, and through the\nmedium of confession stand in his true colours in the eyes of his\nassociates. Unconsciously they were both working out their salvation\nalong the same lines.\n\nThen had come Bennett's resolve to give Ferriss the conspicuous and\nprominent place in his book, the account of the expedition. The more\nBennett dwelt upon Ferriss's heroism, intelligence, and ability the more\nhis task became a labour of love, and the more the idea of self dropped\naway from his thought and imagination. Then--and perhaps this was not\nthe least important factor in Bennett's transformation--sickness had\nbefallen; the strong and self-reliant man had been brought to the\nweakness of a child, whom the pressure of a finger could control. He\nsuddenly changed places with the woman he believed he had, at such\nfearful cost, broken and subdued. His physical strength, once so\nenormous, was as a reed in the woman's hand; his will, so indomitable,\nwas as powerless as an infant's before the woman's calm resolve, rising\nup there before him and overmastering him at a time he believed it to be\nforever weakened.\n\nBennett had come forth from the ordeal chastened, softened, and humbled.\nBut he was shattered, broken, brought to the earth with sorrow and the\nload of unavailing regret. Ambition was numb and lifeless within him.\nReaction from his former attitude of aggression and defiance had carried\nhim far beyond the normal.\n\nHere widened the difference between the man and the woman. Lloyd's\ndiscontinuance of her life-work had been in the nature of heroic\nsubjugation of self. Bennett's abandonment of his career was hardly\nbetter than weakness. In the one it had been renunciation; in the other\nsurrender. In the end, and after all was over, it was the woman who\nremained the stronger.\n\nBut for her, the woman, was it true that all was over? Had the last\nconflict been fought? Was it not rather to be believed that life was one\nlong conflict? Was it not for her, Lloyd, to rouse that sluggard\nambition? Was not this her career, after all, to be his inspiration, his\nincentive, to urge him to the accomplishment of a great work? Now, of\nthe two, she was the stronger. In these new conditions what was her\nduty? Adler's clumsy phrases persisted in her mind. \"That's his work,\"\nAdler had said. \"God Almighty cut him out for that, and he's got to do\nit. Don't let him chuck, don't let him get soft; make him be a man and\nnot a professor.\"\n\nHad she so much influence over Bennett? Could she rouse the restless,\ndaring spirit again? Perhaps; but what would it mean for her--for her,\nwho must be left behind to wait, and wait, and wait--for three years,\nfor five years, for ten years--perhaps forever? And now, at this moment,\nwhen she believed that at last happiness had come to her; when the duty\nhad been done, the grim problems solved; when sickness had been\novercome; when love had come back, and the calm, untroubled days seemed\nlengthening out ahead, there came to her recollection the hideous lapse\nof time that had intervened between the departure of the Freja and the\nexpedition's return; what sleepless nights, what days of unspeakable\nsuspense, what dreadful alternations between hope and despair, what\nsilent, repressed suffering, what haunting, ever-present dread of a\nthing she dared not name! Was the Fear to come into her life again; the\nEnemy that lurked and leered and forebore to strike, that hung upon her\nheels at every hour of the day, that sat down with her to her every\noccupation, that followed after when she stirred abroad, that came close\nto her in the still watches of the night, creeping, creeping to her\nbedside, looming over her in the darkness; the cold fingers reaching\ncloser and closer, the awful face growing ever more distinct, till the\nsuspense of waiting for the blow to fall, for the fingers to grip,\nbecame more than she could bear, and she sprang from her bed with a\nstifled sob of anguish, driven from her rest with quivering lips and\nstreaming eyes?\n\nAbruptly Lloyd rose to her feet, the flowers falling unheeded from her\nlap, her arms rigid at her side, her hands shut tight.\n\n\"No,\" she murmured, \"I cannot. This, at last, is more than I can do.\"\n\nInstantly Adler's halting words went ringing through her brain: \"The\ndanger don't figure; nothing in the world don't figure. It's his work.\"\n\nAdler's words were the words of the world. She alone of the thousands\nwhose eyes were turned toward Bennett was blinded. She was wrong. She\nbelonged to him, but he did not belong to her. The world demanded him;\nthe world called him from her side to do the terrible work that God had\nmade him for. Was she, because she loved him, because of her own single\nanguish, to stand between him and the clamour of the world, between him\nand his work, between him and God?\n\nA work there was for him to do. He must play the man's part. The battle\nmust be fought again. That horrible, grisly Enemy far up there to the\nnorth, upon the high curve of the globe, the shoulder of the world,\nhuge, remorseless, terrible in its vast, Titanic strength, guarding its\nsecret through all the centuries in the innermost of a thousand gleaming\ncoils, must be defied again. The monster that defended the great prize,\nthe object of so many fruitless quests must be once more attacked.\n\nHis was the work, for him the shock of battle, the rigour of the fight,\nthe fierce assault, the ceaseless onset, the unfailing and unflinching\ncourage.\n\nHers was the woman's part. Already she had assumed it; steadfast\nunselfishness, renunciation, patience, the heroism greater than all\nothers, that sits with folded hands, quiet, unshaken, and under fearful\nstress, endures, and endures, and endures. To be the inspiration of\ngreat deeds, high hopes, and firm resolves, and then, while the fight\nwas dared, to wait in calmness for its issue--that was her duty, that,\nthe woman's part in the world's great work.\n\nLloyd was dimly conscious of a certain sweet and subtle element in her\nlove for Bennett that only of late she had begun to recognise and be\naware of. This was a certain vague protective, almost maternal,\ninstinct. Perhaps it was because of his present weakness both of body\nand character, or perhaps it was an element always to be found in the\ndeep and earnest love of any noble-hearted woman. She felt that she, not\nas herself individually, but as a woman, was not only stronger than\nBennett, but in a manner older, more mature. She was conscious of depths\nin her nature far greater than in his, and also that she was capable of\nattaining heights of heroism, devotion, and sacrifice which he, for all\nhis masculine force, could not only never reach, but could not even\nconceive of. It was this consciousness of her larger, better nature that\nmade her feel for Bennett somewhat as a mother feels for a son, a sister\nfor her younger brother. A great tenderness mingled with her affection,\na vast and almost divine magnanimity, a broad, womanly pity for his\nshortcomings, his errors, his faults. It was to her he must look for\nencouragement. It was for her to bind up and reshape the great energy\nthat had been so rudely checked, and not only to call back his strength,\nbut to guide it and direct into its appointed channels.\n\nLloyd returned toward the glass-enclosed veranda to find Bennett just\narousing from his nap. She drew the shawls closer about him and\nrearranged the pillows under his head, and then sat down on the steps\nnear at hand.\n\n\"Tell me about this Captain Duane,\" she began. \"Where is he now?\"\n\nBennett yawned and passed his hand across his face, rubbing the sleep\nfrom his eyes.\n\n\"What time is it? I must have slept over an hour. Duane? Why, you saw\nwhat the paper said. I presume he is at Tasiusak.\"\n\n\"Do you think he will succeed? Do you think he will reach the Pole?\nAdler thinks he won't.\"\n\n\"Oh, perhaps, if he has luck and an open season.\"\n\n\"But tell me, why does he take so many men? Isn't that contrary to the\ncustom? I know a great deal about arctic work. While you were away I\nread every book I could get upon the subject. The best work has been\ndone with small expeditions. If you should go again--when you go again,\nwill you take so many? I saw you quoted somewhere as being in favour of\nonly six or eight men.\"\n\n\"Ten should be the limit--but some one else will make the attempt now.\nI'm out of it. I tried and failed.\"\n\n\"Failed--you! The idea of you ever failing, of you ever giving up! Of\ncourse it was all very well to joke this morning about giving up your\ncareer; but I know you will be up and away again only too soon. I am\ntrying to school myself to expect that.\"\n\n\"Lloyd, I tell you that I am out of it. I don't believe the Pole ever\ncan be reached, and I don't much care whether it is reached or not.\"\n\nSuddenly Lloyd turned to him, the unwonted light flashing in her eyes.\n\"_I_ do, though,\" she cried vehemently. \"It can be done, and\nwe--America--ought to do it.\"\n\nBennett stared at her, startled by her outburst.\n\n\"This English expedition,\" Lloyd continued, the colour flushing in her\ncheeks, \"this Duane-Parsons expedition, they will have the start of\neverybody next year. Nearly every attempt that is made now establishes a\nnew record for a high latitude. One nation after another is creeping\nnearer and nearer almost every year, and each expedition is profiting by\nthe experiences and observations made by the one that preceded it. Some\nday, and not very long now, some nation is going to succeed and plant\nits flag there at last. Why should it not be us? Why shouldn't _our_\nflag be first at the Pole? We who have had so many heroes, such great\nsailors, such splendid leaders, such explorers--our Stanleys, our\nFarraguts, our Decaturs, our De Longs, our Lockwoods--how we would stand\nashamed before the world if some other nation should succeed where we\nhave all but succeeded--Norway, or France, or Russia, or\nEngland--profiting by our experiences, following where we have made the\nway!\"\n\n\"That is very fine,\" admitted Bennett. \"It would be a great honour, the\ngreatest perhaps; and once--I--well, I had my ambitions, too. But it's\nall different now. Something in me died when--Dick--when--I--oh, let\nDuane try. Let him do his best. I know it can't be done, and if he\nshould win, I would be the first to wire congratulations. Lloyd, I don't\ncare. I've lost interest. I suppose it is my punishment. I'm out of the\nrace. I'm a back number. I'm down.\"\n\nLloyd shook her head.\n\n\"I don't--I can't believe you.\"\n\n\"Do you want to see me go,\" demanded Bennett, \"after this last\nexperience? Do you urge me to it?\"\n\nLloyd turned her head away, leaning it against one of the veranda\npillars. A sudden dimness swam in her eyes, the choking ache she knew so\nwell came to her throat. Ah, life was hard for her. The very greatness\nof her nature drove from her the happiness so constantly attained by\nlittle minds, by commonplace souls. When was it to end, this continual\nsacrifice of inclination to duty, this eternal abnegation, this yielding\nup of herself, her dearest, most cherished wishes to the demands of duty\nand the great world?\n\n\"I don't know what I want,\" she said faintly. \"It don't seem as if one\n_could_ be happy--very long.\"\n\nAll at once she moved close to him and laid her cheek upon the arm of\nhis chair and clasped his hand in both her own, murmuring: \"But I have\nyou now, I have you now, no matter what is coming to us.\"\n\nA sense of weakness overcame her. What did she care that Bennett should\nfulfil his destiny, should round out his career, should continue to be\nthe Great Man? It was he, Bennett, that she loved--not his greatness,\nnot his career. Let it all go, let ambition die, let others less worthy\nsucceed in the mighty task. What were fame and honour and glory and the\nsense of a divinely appointed duty done at last to the clasp of his hand\nand the sound of his voice?\n\nIn November of that year Lloyd and Bennett were married. Two guests only\nassisted at the ceremony. These were Campbell and his little daughter\nHattie.\n\n\n\n\nX.\n\n\nThe months passed; Christmas came and went. Until then the winter had\nbeen unusually mild, but January set in with a succession of vicious\ncold snaps and great blustering winds out of the northeast. Lloyd and\nBennett had elected to remain quietly in their new home at Medford. They\nhad no desire to travel, and Bennett's forthcoming book demanded his\nattention. Adler stayed on about the house. He and the dog Kamiska were\ncompanions inseparable. At long intervals visitors presented\nthemselves--Dr. Street, or Pitts, or certain friends of Bennett's. But\nthe great rush of interviewers, editors, and projectors of marvellous\nschemes that had crowded Bennett's anterooms during the spring and early\nsummer was conspicuously dwindling. The press ceased to speak of him;\neven his mail had fallen away. Now, whenever the journals of the day\ndevoted space to arctic exploration, it was invariably in reference to\nthe English expedition wintering on the Greenland coast. That world that\nhad clamoured so loudly upon Bennett's return, while, perhaps, not yet\nforgetting him, was already ignoring him, was looking in other\ndirections. Another man was in the public eye.\n\nBut in every sense these two--Lloyd and Bennett--were out of the world.\nThey had freed themselves from the current of affairs. They stood aside\nwhile the great tide went careering past swift and turbulent, and one of\nthem at least lacked even the interest to look on and watch its\nprogress.\n\nFor a time Lloyd was supremely happy. Their life was unbroken,\nuneventful. The calm, monotonous days of undisturbed happiness to which\nshe had looked forward were come at last. Thus it was always to be.\nIsolated and apart, she could shut her ears to the thunder of the\nworld's great tide that somewhere, off beyond the hills in the direction\nof the City, went swirling through its channels. Hardly an hour went by\nthat she and Bennett were not together. Lloyd had transferred her stable\nto her new home; Lewis was added to the number of their servants, and\nuntil Bennett's old-time vigour completely returned to him she drove out\nalmost daily with her husband, covering the country for miles around.\n\nMuch of their time, however, they spent in Bennett's study. This was a\ngreat apartment in the rear of the house, scantily, almost meanly,\nfurnished. Papers littered the floor; bundles of manuscripts, lists,\ncharts, and observations, the worn and battered tin box of records,\nnote-books, journals, tables of logarithms were piled upon Bennett's\ndesk. A bookcase crammed with volumes of reference, statistical\npamphlets, and the like stood between the windows, while one of the\nwalls was nearly entirely occupied by a vast map of the arctic circle,\nupon which the course of the Freja, her drift in the pack, and the route\nof the expedition's southerly march were accurately plotted.\n\nThe room was bare of ornament; the desk and a couple of chairs were its\nonly furniture. Pictures there were none. Their places were taken by\nphotographs and a great blue print of the shipbuilder's plans and\nspecifications of the Freja.\n\nThe photographs were some of those that Dennison had made of the\nexpedition--the Freja nipped in the ice, a group of the officers and\ncrew upon the forward deck, the coast of Wrangel Island, Cape Kammeni,\npeculiar ice formations, views of the pack under different conditions\nand temperatures, pressure-ridges and scenes of the expedition's daily\nlife in the arctic, bear-hunts, the manufacture of sledges, dog-teams,\nBennett taking soundings and reading the wind-gauge, and one, the last\nview of the Freja, taken just as the ship--her ice-sheathed dripping\nbows heaved high in the air, the flag still at the peak--sank from\nsight.\n\nHowever, on the wall over the blue-print plans of the Freja, one of the\nboat's flags, that had been used by the expedition throughout all the\ntime of its stay in the ice, hung suspended--a faded, tattered square of\nstars and bars.\n\nAs the new life settled quietly and evenly to its grooves a routine\nbegan to develop. About an hour after breakfast Lloyd and Bennett shut\nthemselves in Bennett's \"workroom,\" as he called it, Lloyd taking her\nplace at the desk. She had become his amanuensis, had insisted upon\nwriting to his dictation.\n\n\"Look at that manuscript,\" she had exclaimed one day, turning the sheets\nthat Bennett had written; \"literally the very worst handwriting I have\never seen. What do you suppose a printer would make out of your 'thes'\nand 'ands'? It's hieroglyphics, you know,\" she informed him gravely,\nnodding her head at him.\n\nIt was quite true. Bennett wrote with amazing rapidity and with ragged,\nvigorous strokes of the pen, not unfrequently driving the point through\nthe paper itself; his script was pothooks, clumsy, slanting in all\ndirections, all but illegible. In the end Lloyd had almost pushed him\nfrom his place at the desk, taking the pen from between his fingers,\nexclaiming:\n\n\"Get up! Give me your chair--and that pen. Handwriting like that is\nnothing else but a sin.\"\n\nBennett allowed her to bully him, protesting merely for the enjoyment of\nsquabbling with her.\n\n\"Come, I like this. What are you doing in my workroom anyhow, Mrs.\nBennett? I think you had better go to your housework.\"\n\n\"Don't talk,\" she answered. \"Here are your notes and journal. Now tell\nme what to write.\"\n\nIn the end matters adjusted themselves. Daily Lloyd took her place at\nthe desk, pen in hand, the sleeve of her right arm rolled back to the\nelbow (a habit of hers whenever writing, and which Bennett found to be\ncharming beyond words), her pen travelling steadily from line to line.\nHe on his part paced the floor, a cigar between his teeth, his notes and\nnote-books in his hand, dictating comments of his own, or quoting from\nthe pages, stained, frayed, and crumpled, written by the light of the\nauroras, the midnight suns, or the unsteady, flickering of train-oil\nlanterns and blubber-lamps.\n\nWhat long, delicious hours they spent thus, as the winter drew on, in\nthe absolute quiet of that country house, ignored and lost in the brown,\nbare fields and leafless orchards of the open country! No one troubled\nthem. No one came near them. They asked nothing better than that the\nworld wherein they once had lived, whose hurtling activity and febrile\nunrest they both had known so well, should leave them alone.\n\nOnly one jarring note, and that none too resonant, broke the long\nharmony of Lloyd's happiness during these days. Bennett was deaf to it;\nbut for Lloyd it vibrated continuously and, as time passed, with\nincreasing insistence and distinctness. But for one person in the world\nLloyd could have told herself that her life was without a single element\nof discontent.\n\nThis was Adler. It was not that his presence about the house was a\nreproach to Bennett's wife, for the man was scrupulously unobtrusive. He\nhad the instinctive delicacy that one sometimes discovers in simple,\nundeveloped natures--seafaring folk especially--and though he could not\nbring himself to leave his former chief, he had withdrawn himself more\nthan ever from notice since the time of Bennett's marriage. He rarely\neven waited on the table these days, for Lloyd and Bennett often chose\nto breakfast and dine quite to themselves.\n\nBut, for all that, Lloyd saw Adler from time to time, Kamiska invariably\nat his heels. She came upon him polishing the brasses upon the door of\nthe house, or binding strips of burlaps and sacking about the\nrose-bushes in the garden, or returning from the village post-office\nwith the mail, invariably wearing the same woollen cap, the old\npea-jacket, and the jersey with the name \"Freja\" upon the breast. He\nrarely spoke to her unless she first addressed him, and then always with\na precise salute, bringing his heels sharply together, standing stiffly\nat attention.\n\nBut the man, though all unwittingly, radiated gloom. Lloyd readily saw\nthat Adler was labouring under a certain cloud of disappointment and\ndeferred hope. Naturally she understood the cause. Lloyd was too\nlarge-hearted to feel any irritation at the sight of Adler. But she\ncould not regard him with indifference. To her mind he stood for all\nthat Bennett had given up, for the great career that had stopped\nhalf-way, for the work half done, the task only half completed. In a way\nwas not Adler now superior to Bennett? His one thought and aim and hope\nwas to \"try again.\" His ambition was yet alive and alight; the soldier\nwas willing where the chief lost heart. Never again had Adler addressed\nhimself to Lloyd on the subject of Bennett's inactivity. Now he seemed\nto understand--to realise that once married--and to Lloyd--he must no\nlonger expect Bennett to continue the work. All this Lloyd interpreted\nfrom Adler's attitude, and again and again told herself that she could\nread the man's thoughts aright. She even fancied she caught a mute\nappeal in his eyes upon those rare occasions when they met, as though he\nlooked to her as the only hope, the only means to wake Bennett from his\nlethargy. She imagined that she heard him say:\n\n\"Ain't you got any influence with him, Miss? Won't you talk good talk to\nhim? Don't let him chuck. Make him be a man, and not a professor.\nNothing else in the world don't figure. It's his work. God A'mighty cut\nhim out for that, and he's got to do it.\"\n\nHis work, his work, God made him for that; appointed the task, made the\nman, and now she came between. God, Man, and the Work,--the three vast\nelements of an entire system, the whole universe epitomised in the\ntremendous trinity. Again and again such thoughts assailed her. Duty\nonce more stirred and awoke. It seemed to her as if some great engine\nordained of Heaven to run its appointed course had come to a standstill,\nwas rusting to its ruin, and that she alone of all the world had power\nto grasp its lever, to send it on its way; whither, she did not know;\nwhy, she could not tell. She knew only that it was right that she should\nact. By degrees her resolution hardened. Bennett must try again. But at\nfirst it seemed to her as though her heart would break, and more than\nonce she wavered.\n\nAs Bennett continued to dictate to her the story of the expedition he\narrived at the account of the march toward Kolyuchin Bay, and, finally,\nat the description of the last week, with its terrors, its sufferings,\nits starvation, its despair, when, one by one, the men died in their\nsleeping-bags, to be buried under slabs of ice. When this point in the\nnarrative was reached Bennett inserted no comment of his own; but while\nLloyd wrote, read simply and with grim directness from the entries in\nhis journal precisely as they had been written.\n\nLloyd had known in a vague way that the expedition had suffered\nabominably, but hitherto Bennett had never consented to tell her the\nstory in detail. \"It was a hard week,\" he informed her, \"a rather bad\ngrind.\"\n\nNow, for the first time, she was to know just what had happened, just\nwhat he had endured.\n\nAs usual, Bennett paced the floor from wall to wall, his cigar in his\nteeth, his tattered, grimy ice-journal in his hand. At the desk Lloyd's\nround, bare arm, the sleeve turned up to the elbow, moved evenly back\nand forth as she wrote. In the intervals of Bennett's dictation the\nscratching of Lloyd's pen made itself heard. A little fire snapped and\ncrackled on the hearth. The morning's sun came flooding in at the\nwindows.\n\n\"... Gale of wind from the northeast,\" prompted Lloyd, raising her head\nfrom her writing. Bennett continued:\n\n\"Impossible to march against it in our weakened condition.\"\n\nHe paused for her to complete the sentence.\n\n\"... Must camp here till it abates....\"\n\n\"Have you got that?\" Lloyd nodded.\n\n\"... Made soup of the last of the dog-meat this afternoon.... Our\nlast pemmican gone.\"\n\nThere was a pause; then Bennett resumed:\n\n\"December 1st, Wednesday--Everybody getting weaker.... Metz breaking\ndown.... Sent Adler to the shore to gather shrimps ... we had about\na mouthful apiece at noon ... supper, a spoonful of glycerine and\nhot water.\"\n\nLloyd put her hand to her temple, smoothing back her hair, her face\nturned away. As before, in the park, on that warm and glowing summer\nafternoon, a swift, clear vision of the Ice was vouchsafed to her. She\nsaw the coast of Kolyuchin Bay--primordial desolation, whirling\ndust-like snow, the unleashed wind yelling like a sabbath of witches,\nleaping and somersaulting from rock to rock, folly-stricken and\ninsensate in its hideous dance of death. Bennett continued. His voice\ninsensibly lowered itself, a certain gravity of manner came upon him. At\ntimes he looked at the written pages in his hand with vague, unseeing\neyes. No doubt he, too, was remembering.\n\nHe resumed:\n\n\"December 2d, Thursday--Metz died during the night.... Hansen dying.\nStill blowing a gale from the northeast.... A hard night.\"\n\nLloyd's pen moved slower and slower as she wrote. The lines of the\nmanuscript began to blur and swim before her eyes.\n\nAnd it was to this that she must send him. To this inhuman, horrible\nregion; to this life of prolonged suffering, where death came slowly\nthrough days of starvation, exhaustion, and agony hourly renewed. He\nmust dare it all again. She must force him to it. Her decision had been\ntaken; her duty was plain to her. Now it was irrevocable.\n\n\"... Hansen died during early morning.... Dennison breaking down....\n\n\"... December 5th--Sunday--Dennison found dead this morning between\nAdler and myself....\"\n\nThe vision became plainer, more distinct. She fancied she saw the\ninterior of the tent and the dwindling number of the Freja's survivors\nmoving about on their hands and knees in its gloomy half-light. Their\nhair and beards were long, their faces black with dirt, monstrously\ndistended and fat with the bloated irony of starvation. They were no\nlonger men. After that unspeakable stress of misery nothing but the\nanimal remained.\n\n\"... Too weak to bury him, or even carry him out of the tent.... He\nmust lie where he is.... Last spoonful of glycerine and hot\nwater.... Divine service at 5:30 P.M....\"\n\nOnce more Lloyd faltered in her writing; her hand moved slower. Shut her\nteeth though she might, the sobs would come; swiftly the tears brimmed\nher eyes, but she tried to wink them back, lest Bennett should see.\nHeroically she wrote to the end of the sentence. A pause followed:\n\n\"Yes--' divine services at'--I--I--\"\n\nThe pen dropped from her fingers and she sank down upon her desk, her\nhead bowed in the hollow of her bare arm, shaken from head to foot with\nthe violence of the crudest grief she had ever known. Bennett threw his\njournal from him, and came to her, taking her in his arms, putting her\nhead upon his shoulder.\n\n\"Why, Lloyd, what is it--why, old chap, what the devil! I was a beast to\nread that to you. It wasn't really as bad as that, you know, and\nbesides, look here, look at me. It all happened three years ago. It's\nall over with now.\"\n\nWithout raising her head, and clinging to him all the closer, Lloyd\nanswered brokenly:\n\n\"No, no; it's not all over. It never, never will be.\"\n\n\"Pshaw, nonsense!\" Bennett blustered, \"you must not take it to heart\nlike this. We're going to forget all about it now. Here, damn the book,\nanyhow! We've had enough of it to-day. Put your hat on. We'll have the\nponies out and drive somewhere. And to-night we'll go into town and see\na show at a theatre.\"\n\n\"No,\" protested Lloyd, pushing back from him, drying her eyes. \"You\nshall not think I'm so weak. We will go on with what we have to do--with\nour work. I'm all right now.\"\n\nBennett marched her out of the room without more ado, and, following\nher, closed and locked the door behind them. \"We'll not write another\nword of that stuff to-day. Get your hat and things. I'm going out to\ntell Lewis to put the ponies in.\"\n\nBut that day marked a beginning. From that time on Lloyd never faltered,\nand if there were moments when the iron bit deeper than usual into her\nheart, Bennett never knew her pain. By degrees a course of action\nplanned itself for her. A direct appeal to Bennett she believed would\nnot only be useless, but beyond even her heroic courage. She must\ninfluence him indirectly. The initiative must appear to come from him.\nIt must seem to him that he, of his own accord, roused his dormant\nresolution. It was a situation that called for all her feminine tact,\nall her delicacy, all her instinctive diplomacy.\n\nThe round of their daily life was renewed, but now there was a change.\nIt was subtle, illusive, a vague, indefinite trouble in the air. Lloyd\nhad addressed herself to her task, and from day to day, from hour to\nhour, she held to it, unseen, unnoticed. Now it was a remark dropped as\nif by chance in the course of conversation; now an extract cut from a\nnewspaper or scientific journal, and left where Bennett would find it;\nnow merely a look in her eyes, an instant's significant glance when her\ngaze met her husband's, or a moment's enthusiasm over the news of some\ndiscovery. Insensibly and with infinite caution she directed his\nattention to the world he believed he had abjured; she called into being\nhis interest in his own field of action, reading to him by the hour from\nthe writings of other men, or advancing and championing theories which\nshe knew to be false and ridiculous, but which she goaded him to deny\nand refute.\n\nOne morning she even feigned an exclamation of unbounded astonishment as\nshe opened the newspaper while the two were at breakfast, pretending to\nread from imaginary headlines.\n\n\"Ward, listen! 'The Pole at Last. A Norwegian Expedition Solves the\nMystery of the Arctic. The Goal Reached After--'\"\n\n\"What!\" cried Bennett sharply, his frown lowering.\n\n\"'--After Centuries of Failure.'\" Lloyd put down the paper with a note\nof laughter.\n\n\"Suppose you should read it some day.\"\n\nBennett subsided with a good-humoured growl.\n\n\"You did scare me for a moment. I thought--I thought--\"\n\n\"I did scare you? Why were you scared? What did you think?\" She leaned\ntoward him eagerly.\n\n\"I thought--well--oh--that some other chap, Duane, perhaps--\"\n\n\"He's still at Tasiusak. But he will succeed, I do believe. I've read a\ngreat deal about him. He has energy and determination. If anybody\nsucceeds it will be Duane.\"\n\n\"He? Never!\"\n\n\"Somebody, then.\"\n\n\"You said once that if your husband couldn't nobody could.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, I know,\" she answered cheerfully. \"But you--you are out of\nit now.\"\n\n\"Huh!\" he grumbled. \"It's not because I don't think I could if I wanted\nto.\"\n\n\"No, you could not, Ward. Nobody can.\"\n\n\"But you just said you thought somebody would some day.\"\n\n\"Did I? Oh, suppose you really should one of these days!\"\n\n\"And suppose I never came back?\"\n\n\"Nonsense! Of course you would come back. They all do nowadays.\"\n\n\"De Long didn't.\"\n\n\"But you are not De Long.\"\n\nAnd for the rest of the day Lloyd noted with a sinking heart that\nBennett was unusually thoughtful and preoccupied. She said nothing, and\nwas studious to avoid breaking in upon his reflections, whatever they\nmight be. She kept out of his way as much as possible, but left upon his\ndesk, as if by accident, a copy of a pamphlet issued by a geographical\nsociety, open at an article upon the future of exploration within the\narctic circle. At supper that night Bennett suddenly broke in upon a\nrather prolonged silence with:\n\n\"It's all in the ship. Build a ship strong enough to withstand lateral\npressure of the ice and the whole thing becomes easy.\"\n\nLloyd yawned and stirred her tea indifferently as she answered:\n\n\"Yes, but you know that can't be done.\"\n\nBennett frowned thoughtfully, drumming upon the table.\n\n\"I'll wager _I_ could build one.\"\n\n\"But it's not the ship alone. It's the man. Whom would you get to\ncommand your ship?\"\n\nBennett stared.\n\n\"Why, I would take her, of course.\"\n\n\"You? You have had your share--your chance. Now you can afford to stay\nhome and finish your book--and--well, you might deliver lectures.\"\n\n\"What rot, Lloyd! Can you see me posing on a lecture platform?\"\n\n\"I would rather see you doing that than trying to beat Duane, than\ngetting into the ice again. I would rather see you doing that than to\nknow that you were away up there--in the north, in the ice, at your work\nagain, fighting your way toward the Pole, leading your men and\novercoming every obstacle that stood in your way, never giving up, never\nlosing heart, trying to do the great, splendid, impossible thing;\nrisking your life to reach merely a point on a chart. Yes, I would\nrather see you on a lecture platform than on the deck of an arctic\nsteamship. You know that, Ward.\"\n\nHe shot a glance at her.\n\n\"I would like to know what you mean,\" he muttered.\n\nThe winter went by, then the spring, and by June all the country around\nMedford was royal with summer. During the last days of May, Bennett\npractically had completed the body of his book and now occupied himself\nwith its appendix. There was little variation in their daily life. Adler\nbecame more and more of a fixture about the place. In the first week of\nJune, Lloyd and Bennett had a visitor, a guest; this was Hattie\nCampbell. Mr. Campbell was away upon a business trip, and Lloyd had\narranged to have the little girl spend the fortnight of his absence\nwith her at Medford.\n\nThe summer was delightful. A vast, pervading warmth lay close over all\nthe world. The trees, the orchards, the rose-bushes in the garden about\nthe house, all the teeming life of trees and plants hung motionless and\npoised in the still, tideless ocean of the air. It was very quiet; all\ndistant noises, the crowing of cocks, the persistent calling of robins\nand jays, the sound of wheels upon the road, the rumble of the trains\npassing the station down in the town, seemed muffled and subdued. The\nlong, calm summer days succeeded one another in an unbroken, glimmering\nprocession. From dawn to twilight one heard the faint, innumerable\nmurmurs of the summer, the dull bourdon of bees in the rose and lilac\nbushes, the prolonged, strident buzzing of blue-bottle-flies, the harsh,\ndry scrape of grasshoppers, the stridulating of an occasional cricket.\nIn the twilight and all through the night itself the frogs shrilled from\nthe hedgerows and in the damp, north corners of the fields, while from\nthe direction of the hills toward the east the whippoorwills called\nincessantly. During the day the air was full of odours, distilled as it\nwere by the heat of high noon--the sweet smell of ripening apples, the\nfragrance of warm sap and leaves and growing grass, the smell of cows\nfrom the nearby pastures, the pungent, ammoniacal suggestion of the\nstable back of the house, and the odour of scorching paint blistering on\nthe southern walls.\n\nJuly was very hot. No breath of wind stirred the vast, invisible sea of\nair, quivering and oily under the vertical sun. The landscape was\ndeserted of animated life; there was little stirring abroad. In the\nhouse one kept within the cool, darkened rooms with matting on the\nfloors and comfortable, deep wicker chairs, the windows wide to the\nleast stirring of the breeze. Adler dozed in his canvas hammock slung\nbetween a hitching-post and a crab-apple tree in the shade behind the\nstable. Kamiska sprawled at full length underneath the water-trough, her\ntongue lolling, panting incessantly. An immeasurable Sunday stillness\nseemed to hang suspended in the atmosphere--a drowsy, numbing hush.\nThere was no thought of the passing of time. The day of the week was\nalways a matter of conjecture. It seemed as though this life of heat and\nquiet and unbroken silence was to last forever.\n\nThen suddenly there was an _alerte_. One morning, a day or so after\nHattie Campbell had returned to the City, just as Lloyd and Bennett were\nfinishing their breakfast in the now heavily awninged glass-room, they\nwere surprised to see Adler running down the road toward the house,\nKamiska racing on ahead, barking excitedly. Adler had gone into the town\nfor the mail and morning's paper. This latter he held wide open in his\nhand, and as soon as he caught sight of Lloyd and Bennett waved it about\nhim, shouting as he ran.\n\nLloyd's heart began to beat. There was only one thing that could excite\nAdler to this degree--the English expedition; Adler had news of it; it\nwas in the paper. Duane had succeeded; had been working steadily\nnorthward during all these past months, while Bennett--\n\n\"Stuck in the ice! stuck in the ice!\" shouted Adler as he swung wide the\nfront gate and came hastening toward the veranda across the lawn. \"What\ndid we say! Hooray! He's stuck. I knew it; any galoot might 'a' known\nit. Duane's stuck tighter'n a wedge off Bache Island, in Kane Basin.\nHere it all is; read it for yourself.\"\n\nBennett took the paper from him and read aloud to the effect that the\nCurlew, accompanied by her collier, which was to follow her to the\nsoutherly limit of Kane Basin, had attempted the passage of Smith Sound\nlate in June. But the season, as had been feared, was late. The enormous\nquantities of ice reported by the whalers the previous year had not\ndebouched from the narrow channel, and on the last day of June the\nCurlew had found her further progress effectually blocked. In essaying\nto force her way into a lead the ice had closed in behind her, and,\nwhile not as yet nipped, the vessel was immobilised. There was no hope\nthat she would advance northward until the following summer. The\ncollier, which had not been beset, had returned to Tasiusak with the\nnews of the failure.\n\n\"What a galoot! What a--a professor!\" exclaimed Adler with a vast\ndisdain. \"Him loafing at Tasiusak waiting for open water, when the Alert\nwintered in eighty-two-twenty-four! Well, he's shelved for another year,\nanyhow.\"\n\nLater on, after breakfast, Lloyd and Bennett shut themselves in\nBennett's workroom, and for upward of three hours addressed themselves\nto the unfinished work of the previous day, compiling from Bennett's\nnotes a table of temperatures of the sea-water taken at different\nsoundings. Alternating with the scratching of Lloyd's pen, Bennett's\nvoice continued monotonously:\n\n\"August 15th--2,000 meters or 1,093 fathoms--minus .66 degrees\ncentigrade or 30.81 Fahrenheit.\"\n\n\"Fahrenheit,\" repeated Lloyd as she wrote the last word.\n\n\"August 16th--1,600 meters or 874  fathoms--\"\n\n\"Eight hundred and seventy-four fathoms,\" repeated Lloyd as Bennett\npaused abstractedly.\n\n\"Or ... he's in a bad way, you know.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"It's a bad bit of navigation along there. The Proteus was nipped and\ncrushed to kindling in about that same latitude ... h'm\" ... Bennett\ntugged at his mustache. Then, suddenly, as if coming to himself:\n\"Well--these temperatures now. Where were we? 'Eight hundred and\nseventy-four fathoms, minus forty-six hundredths degrees centigrade.'\"\n\nOn the afternoon of the next day, just as they were finishing this\ntable, there was a knock at the door. It was Adler, and as Bennett\nopened the door he saluted and handed him three calling-cards. Bennett\nuttered an exclamation of surprise, and Lloyd turned about from the\ndesk, her pen poised in the air over the half-written sheet.\n\n\"They might have let me know they were coming,\" she heard Bennett\nmutter. \"What do they want?\"\n\n\"Guess they came on that noon train, sir,\" hazarded Adler. \"They didn't\nsay what they wanted, just inquired for you.\"\n\n\"Who is it?\" asked Lloyd, coming forward.\n\nBennett read off the names on the cards.\n\n\"Well, it's Tremlidge--that's the Tremlidge of the Times; he's the\neditor and proprietor--and Hamilton Garlock--has something to do with\nthat new geographical society--president, I believe--and this one\"--he\nhanded her the third card--\"is a friend of yours, Craig V. Campbell, of\nthe Hercules Wrought Steel Company.\"\n\nLloyd stared. \"What can they want?\" she murmured, looking up to him from\nthe card in some perplexity. Bennett shook his head.\n\n\"Tell them to come up here,\" he said to Adler.\n\nLloyd hastily drew down her sleeve over her bare arm.\n\n\"Why up here, Ward?\" she inquired abruptly.\n\n\"Should we have seen them downstairs?\" he demanded with a frown. \"I\nsuppose so; I didn't think. Don't go,\" he added, putting a hand on her\narm as she started for the door. \"You might as well hear what they have\nto say.\"\n\nThe visitors entered, Adler holding open the door--Campbell, well\ngroomed, clean-shaven, and gloved even in that warm weather; Tremlidge,\nthe editor of one of the greater daily papers of the City (and of the\ncountry for the matter of that), who wore a monocle and carried a straw\nhat under his arm; and Garlock, the vice-president of an international\ngeographical society, an old man, with beautiful white hair curling\nabout his ears, a great bow of black silk knotted about his\nold-fashioned collar. The group presented, all unconsciously, three\ngreat and highly developed phases of nineteenth-century\nintelligence--science, manufactures, and journalism--each man of them a\nmaster in his calling.\n\nWhen the introductions and preliminaries were over, Bennett took up his\nposition again in front of the fireplace, leaning against the mantle,\nhis hands in his pockets. Lloyd sat opposite to him at the desk, resting\nher elbow on the edge. Hanging against the wall behind her was the vast\nchart of the arctic circle. Tremlidge, the editor, sat on the bamboo\nsofa near the end of the room, his elbows on his knees, gently tapping\nthe floor with the ferrule of his slim walking-stick; Garlock, the\nscientist, had dropped into the depths of a huge leather chair and\nleaned back in it comfortably, his legs crossed, one boot swinging\ngently; Campbell stood behind this chair, drumming on the back\noccasionally with the fingers of one hand, speaking to Bennett over\nGarlock's shoulder, and from time to time turning to Tremlidge for\ncorroboration and support of what he was saying.\n\nAbruptly the conference began.\n\n\"Well, Mr. Bennett, you got our wire?\" Campbell said by way of\ncommencement.\n\nBennett shook his head.\n\n\"No,\" he returned in some surprise; \"no, I got no wire.\"\n\n\"That's strange,\" said Tremlidge. \"I wired three days ago asking for\nthis interview. The address was right, I think. I wired: 'Care of Dr.\nPitts.' Isn't that right?\"\n\n\"That probably accounts for it,\" answered Bennett. \"This is Pitts's\nhouse, but he does not live here now. Your despatch, no doubt, went to\nhis office in the City, and was forwarded to him. He's away just now,\ntravelling, I believe. But--you're here. That's the essential.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" murmured Garlock, looking to Campbell. \"We're here, and we want\nto have a talk with you.\"\n\nCampbell, who had evidently been chosen spokesman, cleared his throat.\n\n\"Well, Mr. Bennett, I don't know just how to begin, so suppose\nI begin at the beginning. Tremlidge and I belong to the same club in\nthe City, and in some way or other we have managed to see a good deal\nof each other during the last half-dozen years. We find that we have\na good deal in common. I don't think his editorial columns are for\nsale, and he doesn't believe there are blow-holes in my steel plates.\nI really do believe we have certain convictions. Tremlidge seems to\nhave an idea that journalism can be clean and yet enterprising, and\ntries to run his sheet accordingly, and I am afraid that I would not\nmake a bid for bridge girders below what it would cost to manufacture\nthem honestly. Tremlidge and I differ in politics; we hold conflicting\nviews as to municipal government; we attend different churches; we are\nat variance in the matter of public education, of the tariff, of\nemigration, and, heaven save the mark! of capital and labour, but we\ntell ourselves that we are public-spirited and are a little proud that\nGod allowed us to be born in the United States; also it appears that we\nhave more money than Henry George believes to be right. Now,\" continued\nMr. Campbell, straightening himself as though he were about to touch\nupon the real subject of his talk, \"when the news of your return, Mr.\nBennett, was received, it was, as of course you understand, the one\ntopic of conversation in the streets, the clubs, the newspaper\noffices--everywhere. Tremlidge and I met at our club at luncheon the\nnext week, and I remember perfectly well how long and how very earnestly\nwe talked of your work and of arctic exploration in general.\n\n\"We found out all of a sudden that here at last was a subject we were\nagreed upon, a subject in which we took an extraordinary mutual\ninterest. We discovered that we had read almost every explorer's book\nfrom Sir John Franklin down. We knew all about the different theories\nand plans of reaching the Pole. We knew how and why they had all failed;\nbut, for all that, we were both of the opinion\" (Campbell leaned\nforward, speaking with considerable energy) \"that it can be done, and\nthat America ought to do it. That would be something better than even a\nWorld's Fair.\n\n\"We give out a good deal of money, Tremlidge and I, every year to public\nworks and one thing or another. We buy pictures by American\nartists--pictures that we don't want; we found a scholarship now and\nthen; we contribute money to build groups of statuary in the park; we\ngive checks to the finance committees of libraries and museums and all\nthe rest of it, but, for the lives of us, we can feel only a mild\ninterest in the pictures and statues, and museums and colleges, though\nwe go on buying the one and supporting the other, because we think that\nsomehow it is right for us to do it. I'm afraid we are men more of\naction than of art, literature, and the like. Tremlidge is, I know. He\nwants facts, accomplished results. When he gives out his money he wants\nto see the concrete, substantial return--and I'm not sure that I am not\nof the same way of thinking.\n\n\"Well, with this and with that, and after talking it all over a dozen\ntimes--twenty times--we came to the conclusion that what we would most\nlike to aid financially would be a successful attempt by an\nAmerican-built ship, manned by American seamen, led by an American\ncommander, to reach the North Pole. We came to be very enthusiastic\nabout our idea; but we want it American from start to finish. We will\nstart the subscription, and want to head the list with our checks; but\nwe want every bolt in that ship forged in American foundries from metal\ndug out of American soil. We want every plank in her hull shaped from\nAmerican trees, every sail of her woven by American looms, every man of\nher born of American parents, and we want it this way because we believe\nin American manufactures, because we believe in American shipbuilding,\nbecause we believe in American sailmakers, and because we believe in the\nintelligence and pluck and endurance and courage of the American sailor.\n\n\"Well,\" Campbell continued, changing his position and speaking in a\nquieter voice, \"we did not say much to anybody, and, in fact, we never\nreally planned any expedition at all. We merely talked about its\npractical nature and the desirability of having it distinctively\nAmerican. This was all last summer. What we wanted to do was to make the\nscheme a popular one. It would not be hard to raise a hundred thousand\ndollars from among a dozen or so men whom we both know, and we found\nthat we could count upon the financial support of Mr. Garlock's society.\nThat was all very well, but we wanted the _people_ to back this\nenterprise. We would rather get a thousand five-dollar subscriptions\nthan five of a thousand dollars each. When our ship went out we wanted\nher commander to feel, not that there were merely a few millionaires,\nwho had paid for his equipment and his vessel, behind him, but that he\nhad seventy millions of people, a whole nation, at his back.\n\n\"So Tremlidge went to work and telegraphed instructions to the\nWashington correspondents of his paper to sound quietly the temper of as\nmany Congressmen as possible in the matter of making an appropriation\ntoward such an expedition. It was not so much the money we wanted as the\nsanction of the United States. Anything that has to do with the Navy is\npopular just at present. We had got a Congressman to introduce and\nfather an appropriation bill, and we could count upon the support of\nenough members of both houses to put it through. We wanted Congress to\nappropriate twenty thousand dollars. We hoped to raise another ten\nthousand dollars by popular subscription. Mr. Garlock could assure us\ntwo thousand dollars; Tremlidge would contribute twenty thousand dollars\nin the name of the Times, and I pledged myself to ten thousand dollars,\nand promised to build the ship's engines and fittings. We kept our\nintentions to ourselves, as Tremlidge did not want the other papers to\nget hold of the story before the Times printed it. But we continued to\nlay our wires at Washington. Everything was going as smooth as oil; we\nseemed sure of the success of our appropriation bill, and it was even to\nbe introduced next week, when the news came of the collapse of the\nEnglish expedition--the Duane-Parsons affair.\n\n\"You would have expected precisely an opposite effect, but it has\nknocked our chances with Congress into a cocked hat. Our member, who was\nto father the bill, declared to us that so sure as it was brought up now\nit would be killed in committee. I went to Washington at once; it was\nthis, and not, as you supposed, private business that has taken me away.\nI saw our member and Tremlidge's head correspondent. It was absolutely\nno use. These men who have their finger upon the Congressional pulse\nwere all of the same opinion. It would be useless to try to put through\nour bill at present. Our member said 'Wait;' all Tremlidge's men said\n'Wait--wait for another year, until this English expedition and its\nfailure are forgotten, and then try again.' But we don't want to wait.\nSuppose Duane _is_ blocked for the present. He has a tremendous start.\nHe's on the ground. By next summer the chances are the ice will have so\nbroken up as to permit him to push ahead, and by the time our bill gets\nthrough and our ship built and launched he may be--heaven knows where,\nright up to the Pole, perhaps. No, we can't afford to give England such\nlong odds. We want to lay the keel of our ship as soon as we can--next\nweek, if possible; we've got the balance of the summer and all the\nwinter to prepare in, and a year from this month we want our American\nexpedition to be inside the polar circle, to be up with Duane, and at\nleast to break even with England. If we can do that we're not afraid of\nthe result, provided,\" continued Mr. Campbell, \"provided _you_, Mr.\nBennett, are in command. If you consent to make the attempt, only one\npoint remains to be settled. Congress has failed us. We will give up the\nidea of an appropriation. Now, then, and this is particularly what we\nwant to consult you about, how are we going to raise the twenty thousand\ndollars?\"\n\nLloyd rose to her feet.\n\n\"You may draw on me for the amount,\" she said quietly.\n\nGarlock uncrossed his legs and sat up abruptly in the deep-seated chair.\nTremlidge screwed his monocle into his eye and stared, while Campbell\nturned about sharply at the sound of Lloyd's voice with a murmur of\nastonishment. Bennett alone did not move. As before, he leaned heavily\nagainst the mantelpiece, his hands in his pockets, his head and his huge\nshoulders a little bent. Only from under his thick, knotted frown he\nshot a swift glance toward his wife. Lloyd paid no attention to the\nothers. After that one quiet movement that had brought her to her feet\nshe remained motionless and erect, her hands hanging straight at her\nsides, the colour slowly mounting to her cheeks. She met Bennett's\nglance and held it steadily, calmly, looking straight into his eyes. She\nsaid no word, but all her love for him, all her hopes of him, all the\nfine, strong resolve that, come what would, his career should not be\nbroken, his ambition should not faint through any weakness of hers, all\nher eager sympathy for his great work, all her strong, womanly\nencouragement for him to accomplish his destiny spoke to him, and called\nto him in that long, earnest look of her dull-blue eyes. Now she was no\nlonger weak; now she could face the dreary consequences that, for her,\nmust follow the rousing of his dormant energy; now was no longer the\ntime for indirect appeal; the screen was down between them. More\neloquent than any spoken words was the calm, steady gaze in which she\nheld his own.\n\nThere was a long silence while husband and wife stood looking deep into\neach other's eyes. And then, as a certain slow kindling took place in\nhis look, Lloyd saw that at last Bennett _understood_.\n\nAfter that the conference broke up rapidly. Campbell, as the head and\nspokesman of the committee, noted the long, significant glance that had\npassed between Bennett and Lloyd, and, perhaps, vaguely divined that he\nhad touched upon a matter of a particularly delicate and intimate\nnature. Something was in the air, something was passing between husband\nand wife in which the outside world had no concern--something not meant\nfor him to see. He brought the interview to an end as quickly as\npossible. He begged of Bennett to consider this talk as a mere\npreliminary--a breaking of the ground. He would give Bennett time to\nthink it over. Speaking for himself and the others, he was deeply\nimpressed with that generous offer to meet the unexpected deficiency,\nbut it had been made upon the spur of the moment. No doubt Mr. Bennett\nand his wife would wish to talk it over between themselves, to consider\nthe whole matter. The committee temporarily had its headquarters in his\n(Campbell's) offices. He left Bennett the address. He would await his\ndecision and answer there.\n\nWhen the conference ended Bennett accompanied the members of the\ncommittee downstairs and to the front door of the house. The three had,\nwith thanks and excuses, declined all invitations to dine at Medford\nwith Bennett and his wife. They could conveniently catch the next train\nback to the City; Campbell and Tremlidge were in a hurry to return to\ntheir respective businesses.\n\nThe front gate closed. Bennett was left alone. He shut the front door of\nthe house, and for an instant stood leaning against it, his small eyes\ntwinkling under his frown, his glance straying aimlessly about amid the\nfamiliar objects of the hallway and adjoining rooms. He was thoughtful,\nperturbed, tugging slowly at the ends of his mustache. Slowly he\nascended the stairs, gaining the landing on the second floor and going\non toward the half-open door of the \"workroom\" he had just quitted.\nLloyd was uppermost in his mind. He wanted her, his wife, and that at\nonce. He was conscious that a great thing had suddenly transpired; that\nall the calm and infinitely happy life of the last year was ruthlessly\nbroken up; but in his mind there was nothing more definite, nothing\nstronger than the thought of his wife and the desire for her\ncompanionship and advice.\n\nHe came into the \"workroom,\" closing the door behind him with his heel,\nhis hands deep in his pockets. Lloyd was still there, standing opposite\nhim as he entered. She hardly seemed to have moved while he had been\ngone. They did not immediately speak. Once more their eyes met. Then at\nlength:\n\n\"Well, Lloyd?\"\n\n\"Well, my husband?\"\n\nBennett was about to answer--what, he hardly knew; but at that moment\nthere was a diversion.\n\nThe old boat's flag, the tattered little square of faded stars and bars\nthat had been used to mark the line of many a weary march, had been\nhanging, as usual, over the blue-print plans of the Freja on the wail\nopposite the window. Inadequately fixed in its place, the jar of the\nclosing door as Bennett shut it behind him dislodged it, and it fell to\nthe floor close beside him.\n\nHe stooped and picked it up, and, holding it in his hand, turned toward\nthe spot whence it had fallen. He cast a glance at the wall above the\nplans of the Freja, about to replace it, willing for the instant to\ndefer the momentous words he felt must soon be spoken, willing to put\noff the inevitable a few seconds longer.\n\n\"I don't know,\" he muttered, looking from the flag to the empty\nwall-spaces about the room; \"I don't know just where to put this. Do\nyou--\"\n\n\"Don't you know?\" interrupted Lloyd suddenly, her blue eyes all alight.\n\n\"No,\" said Bennett; \"I--\"\n\nLloyd caught the flag from his hands and, with one great sweep of her\narm, drove its steel-shod shaft full into the centre of the great chart\nof the polar region, into the innermost concentric circle where the Pole\nwas marked.\n\n\"Put that flag there!\" she cried.\n\n\n\n\nXI.\n\n\nThat particular day in the last week in April was sombre and somewhat\nchilly, but there was little wind. The water of the harbour lay smooth\nas a sheet of tightly stretched gray silk. Overhead the sea-fog drifted\ngradually landward, descending, as it drifted, till the outlines of the\nCity grew blurred and indistinct, resolving to a dim, vast mass, rugged\nwith high-shouldered office buildings and bulging, balloon-like domes,\nconfused and mysterious under the cloak of the fog. In the nearer\nforeground, along the lines of the wharves and docks, a wilderness of\nmasts and spars of a tone just darker than the gray of the mist stood\naway from the blur of the background with the distinctness and delicacy\nof frost-work.\n\nBut amid all this grayness of sky and water and fog one distinguished\ncertain black and shifting masses. They outlined every wharf, they\nbanked every dock, every quay. Every small and inconsequent jetty had\nits fringe of black. Even the roofs of the buildings along the\nwater-front were crested with the same dull-coloured mass.\n\nIt was the People, the crowd, rank upon rank, close-packed, expectant,\nthronging there upon the City's edge, swelling in size with the lapse of\nevery minute, vast, conglomerate, restless, and throwing off into the\nstillness of the quiet gray air a prolonged, indefinite murmur, a\nmonotonous minor note.\n\nThe surface of the bay was dotted over with all manner of craft black\nwith people. Rowboats, perilously overcrowded, were everywhere.\nFerryboats and excursion steamers, chartered for that day, heeled over\nalmost to the water's edge with the unsteady weight of their passengers.\nTugboats passed up and down similarly crowded and displaying the flags\nof various journals and news organisations--the News, the Press, the\nTimes, and the Associated Press. Private yachts, trim and very graceful\nand gleaming with brass and varnish, slipped by with scarcely a ripple\nto mark their progress, while full in the centre of the bay, gigantic,\nsolid, formidable, her grim, silent guns thrusting their snouts from her\nturrets, a great, white battleship rode motionless to her anchor.\n\nAn hour passed; noon came. At long intervals a faint seaward breeze\ncompressed the fog, and high, sad-coloured clouds and a fine and\npenetrating rain came drizzling down. The crowds along the wharves grew\ndenser and blacker. The numbers of yachts, boats, and steamers\nincreased; even the yards and masts of the merchant-ships were dotted\nover with watchers.\n\nThen, at length, from far up the bay there came a faint, a barely\nperceptible, droning sound, the sound of distant shouting. Instantly the\ncrowds were alert, and a quick, surging movement rippled from end to end\nof the throng along the water-front. Its subdued murmur rose in pitch\nupon the second. Like a flock of agitated gulls, the boats in the\nharbour stirred nimbly from place to place; a belated newspaper tug tore\nby, headed for the upper bay, smoking fiercely, the water boiling from\nher bows. From the battleship came the tap of a drum. The excursion\nsteamers and chartered ferryboats moved to points of vantage and took\nposition, occasionally feeling the water with their paddles.\n\nThe distant, droning sound drew gradually nearer, swelling in volume,\nand by degrees splitting into innumerable component parts. One began to\ndistinguish the various notes that contributed to its volume--a sharp,\nquick volley of inarticulate shouts or a cadenced cheer or a hoarse\nsalvo of steam whistles. Bells began to ring in different quarters of\nthe City.\n\nThen all at once the advancing wave of sound swept down like the rush of\na great storm. A roar as of the unchained wind leaped upward from those\nbanked and crowding masses. It swelled louder and louder, deafening,\ninarticulate. A vast bellow of exultation split the gray, low-hanging\nheavens. Erect plumes of steam shot upward from the ferry and excursion\nboats, but the noise of their whistles was lost and drowned in the\nreverberation of that mighty and prolonged clamour. But suddenly the\nindeterminate thunder was pierced and dominated by a sharp and\ndeep-toned report, and a jet of white smoke shot out from the flanks of\nthe battleship. Her guns had spoken. Instantly and from another quarter\nof her hull came another jet of white smoke, stabbed through with its\nthin, yellow flash, and another abrupt clap of thunder shook the windows\nof the City.\n\nThe boats that all the morning had been moving toward the upper bay were\nreturning. They came slowly, a veritable fleet, steaming down the bay,\nheaded for the open sea, beyond the entrance of the harbour, each\ncrowded and careening to the very gunwales, each whistling with might\nand main.\n\nAnd in their midst--the storm-centre round which this tempest of\nacclamation surged, the object on which so many eyes were focussed, the\nhope of an entire nation--one ship.\n\nShe was small and seemingly pitifully inadequate for the great adventure\non which she was bound; her lines were short and ungraceful. From her\nclumsy iron-shod bow to her high, round stern, from her bulging sides to\nthe summit of her short, powerful masts there was scant beauty in her.\nShe was broad, blunt, evidently slow in her movements, and in the smooth\nwaters of the bay seemed out of her element. But, for all that, she\nimparted an impression of compactness, the compactness of things dwarfed\nand stunted. Vast, indeed, would be the force that would crush those\nbulging flanks, so cunningly built, moreover, that the ship must slip\nand rise to any too great lateral pressure. Far above her waist rose her\nsmokestack. Overhead upon the mainmast was affixed the crow's nest.\nWhaleboats and cutters swung from her davits, while all her decks were\ncumbered with barrels, with crates, with boxes and strangely shaped\nbales and cases.\n\nShe drew nearer, continuing that slow, proud progress down the bay,\nhonoured as no visiting sovereign had ever been. The great white\nman-of-war dressed ship as she passed, and the ensign at her\nfighting-top dipped and rose again. At once there was a movement aboard\nthe little outbound ship; one of her crew ran aft and hauled sharply at\nthe halyards, and then at her peak there was broken out not the\nbrilliant tri-coloured banner, gay and brave and clean, but a little\nlength of bunting, tattered and soiled, a faded breadth of stars and\nbars, a veritable battle-flag, eloquent of strenuous endeavour, of\nfighting without quarter, and of hardship borne without flinching and\nwithout complaining.\n\nThe ship with her crowding escorts held onward. By degrees the City was\npassed; the bay narrowed oceanwards little by little. The throng of\npeople, the boom of cannon, and the noise of shouting dropped astern.\nOne by one the boats of the escorting squadron halted, drew off, and,\nturning with a parting blast of their whistles, headed back to the City.\nOnly the larger, heavier steamers and the sea-going tugs still kept on\ntheir way. On either shore of the bay the houses began to dwindle,\ngiving place to open fields, brown and sear under the scudding sea-fog,\nfor now a wind was building up from out the east, and the surface of the\nbay had begun to ruffle.\n\nHalf a mile farther on the slow, huge, groundswells began to come in; a\nlighthouse was passed. Full in view, on ahead, stretched the open, empty\nwaste of ocean. Another steamer turned back, then another, then another,\nthen the last of the newspaper tugs. The fleet, reduced now to half a\ndozen craft, ploughed on through and over the groundswells, the ship\nthey were escorting leading the way, her ragged little ensign straining\nstiff in the ocean wind. At the entrance of the bay, where the enclosing\nshores drew together and trailed off to surf-beaten sand-spits, three\nmore of the escort halted, and, unwilling to face the tumbling expanse\nof the ocean, bleak and gray, turned homeward. Then just beyond the bar\ntwo more of the remaining boats fell off and headed Cityward; a third\nimmediately did likewise. The outbound ship was left with only one\ncompanion.\n\nBut that one, a sturdy little sea-going tug, held close, close to the\nflank of the departing vessel, keeping even pace with her and lying\nalongside as nearly as she dared, for the fog had begun to thicken, and\ndistant objects were shut from sight by occasional drifting patches.\n\nOn board the tug there was but one passenger--a woman. She stood upon\nthe forward deck, holding to a stanchion with one strong, white hand,\nthe strands of her bronze-red hair whipping across her face, the salt\nspray damp upon her cheeks. She was dressed in a long, brown ulster, its\ncape flying from her shoulders as the wind lifted it. Small as was the\noutgoing ship, the tug was still smaller, and its single passenger had\nto raise her eyes above her to see the figure of a man upon the bridge\nof the ship, a tall, heavily built figure, buttoned from heel to chin in\na greatcoat, who stood there gripping the rail of the bridge with one\nhand, and from time to time giving an order to his sailing-master, who\nstood in the centre of the bridge before the compass and electric\nindicator.\n\nBetween the man upon the bridge and the woman on the forward deck of the\ntug there was from time to time a little conversation. They called to\none another above the throbbing of the engines and the wash of the sea\nalongside, and in the sound of their voices there was a note of\nattempted cheerfulness. Practically they were alone, with the exception\nof the sailing-master on the bridge. The crew of the ship were nowhere\nin sight. On the tug no one but the woman was to be seen. All around\nthem stretched the fog-ridden sea.\n\nThen at last, in answer to a question from the man on the bridge, the\nwoman said:\n\n\"Yes--I think I had better.\"\n\nAn order was given. The tug's bell rang in her engine-room, and the\nengine slowed and stopped. For some time the tug continued her headway,\nranging alongside the ship as before. Then she began to fall behind, at\nfirst slowly, then with increasing swiftness. The outbound ship\ncontinued on her way, and between the two the water widened and widened.\nBut the fog was thick; in another moment the two would be shut out from\neach other's sight. The moment of separation was come.\n\nThen Lloyd, standing alone on that heaving deck, drew herself up to her\nfull height, her head a little back, her blue eyes all alight, a smile\nupon her lips. She spoke no word. She made no gesture, but stood there,\nthe smile yet upon her lips, erect, firm, motionless; looking steadily,\ncalmly, proudly into Bennett's eyes as his ship carried him farther and\nfarther away.\n\nSuddenly the fog shut down. The two vessels were shut from each other's\nsight.\n\nAs Bennett stood leaning upon the rail of the bridge behind him, his\nhands deep in the pockets of his greatcoat, his eyes fixed on the\nvisible strip of water just ahead of his ship's prow, the\nsailing-master, Adler, approached and saluted.\n\n\"Beg pardon, sir,\" he said, \"we're just clear of the last buoy; what's\nour course now, sir?\"\n\nBennett glanced at the chart that Adler held and then at the compass\naffixed to the rail of the bridge close at hand. Quietly he answered:\n\n\"Due north.\"\n\n\n\n***END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK A MAN'S WOMAN***\n\n\n******* This file should be named 16096-8.txt or 16096-8.zip *******\n\n\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\nhttp:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/dirs\/1\/6\/0\/9\/16096\n\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\/fundraising\/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit:\nhttp:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\/fundraising\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":1388,"split":"test"}
