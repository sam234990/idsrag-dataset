He retires to a summer mountain resort named Baldpate Inn, in the dead of winter, and locks himself in, believing he has the sole key. However he is visited during the night by a rapid succession of other people (melodrama stock types), including a corrupt politician, a crooked cop, a hermit, a feisty girl reporter, a gang of criminals, etc., none of whom have any trouble getting into the remote inn\u00e2\u0080\u0094there appear to be seven keys to Baldpate.\nMcGee gets no work done, instead being drawn into the hijinks of the other visitors. He eventually foils a plot by the crooks to steal money from the hotel safe that is earmarked for a city street railroad deal, and he falls in love with the reporter. He observes derisively that all of these complicated incidents and characters are ones that he has written over and over again. Just before midnight, he finds out that everyone is an actor hired to perpetrate a hoax, orchestrated by McGee's friend to keep him from completing the story.\nIn the epilogue, the inn is empty, and a typewriter is clattering upstairs: McGee has finished his story before midnight and won the bet.

That is exactly what Billy Magee wanted to know\nas, closing the waiting-room door behind him, he stood staring just\ninside. Were the features against which that frail bit of cambric was\nagonizingly pressed of a pleasing contour? The girl's neatly tailored\ncorduroy suit and her flippant but charming millinery augured well.\nShould he step gallantly forward and inquire in sympathetic tones as to\nthe cause of her woe? Should he carry chivalry even to the lengths of\nUpper Asquewan Falls?\n\nNo, Mr. Magee decided he would not. The train that had just roared away\ninto the dusk had not brought him from the region of skyscrapers and\nderby hats for deeds of knight errantry up state. Anyhow, the girl's\ntears were none of his business. A railway station was a natural place\nfor grief--a field of many partings, upon whose floor fell often in\ntorrents the tears of those left behind. A friend, mayhap a lover, had\nbeen whisked off into the night by the relentless five thirty-four\nlocal. Why not a lover? Surely about such a dainty trim figure as this\ncourtiers hovered as moths about a flame. Upon a tender intimate sorrow\nit was not the place of an unknown Magee to intrude. He put his hand\ngently upon the latch of the door.\n\nAnd yet--dim and heartless and cold was the interior of that\nwaiting-room. No place, surely, for a gentleman to leave a lady\nsorrowful, particularly when the lady was so alluring. Oh, beyond\nquestion, she was most alluring. Mr. Magee stepped softly to the ticket\nwindow and made low-voiced inquiry of the man inside.\n\n\"What's she crying about?\" he asked.\n\nA thin sallow face, on the forehead of which a mop of ginger-colored\nhair lay listlessly, was pressed against the bars.\n\n\"Thanks,\" said the ticket agent. \"I get asked the same old questions so\noften, one like yours sort of breaks the monotony. Sorry I can't help\nyou. She's a woman, and the Lord only knows why women cry. And sometimes\nI reckon even He must be a little puzzled. Now, my wife--\"\n\n\"I think I'll ask her,\" confided Mr. Magee in a hoarse whisper.\n\n\"Oh, I wouldn't,\" advised the man behind the bars. \"It's best to let 'em\nalone. They stop quicker if they ain't noticed.\"\n\n\"But she's in trouble,\" argued Billy Magee.\n\n\"And so'll you be, most likely,\" responded the cynic, \"if you interfere.\nNo, siree! Take my advice. Shoot old Asquewan's rapids in a barrel if\nyou want to, but keep away from crying women.\"\n\nThe heedless Billy Magee, however, was already moving across the\nunscrubbed floor with chivalrous intention.\n\nThe girl's trim shoulders no longer heaved so unhappily. Mr. Magee,\napproaching, thought himself again in the college yard at dusk, with the\ngreat elms sighing overhead, and the fresh young voices of the glee club\nringing out from the steps of a century-old building. What were the\nwords they sang so many times?\n\n    \"Weep no more, my lady,\n    Oh! weep no more to-day.\"\n\nHe regretted that he could not make use of them. They had always seemed\nto him so sad and beautiful. But troubadours, he knew, went out of\nfashion long before railway stations came in. So his remark to the young\nwoman was not at all melodious:\n\n\"Can I do anything?\"\n\nA portion of the handkerchief was removed, and an eye which, Mr. Magee\nnoted, was of an admirable blue, peeped out at him. To the gaze of even\na solitary eye, Mr. Magee's aspect was decidedly pleasing. Young\nWilliams, who posed at the club as a wit, had once said that Billy Magee\ncame as near to being a magazine artist's idea of the proper hero of a\nstory as any man could, and at the same time retain the respect and\naffection of his fellows. Mr. Magee thought he read approval in the lone\neye of blue. When the lady spoke, however, he hastily revised his\nopinion.\n\n\"Yes,\" she said, \"you can do something. You can go away--far, far away.\"\n\nMr. Magee stiffened. Thus chivalry fared in Upper Asquewan Falls in the\nyear 1911.\n\n\"I beg your pardon,\" he remarked. \"You seemed to be in trouble, and I\nthought I might possibly be of some assistance.\"\n\nThe girl removed the entire handkerchief. The other eye proved to be the\nsame admirable blue--a blue half-way between the shade of her corduroy\nsuit and that of the jacky's costume in the \"See the World--Join the\nNavy\" poster that served as background to her woe.\n\n\"I don't mean to be rude,\" she explained more gently, \"but--I'm crying,\nyou see, and a girl simply can't look attractive when she cries.\"\n\n\"If I had only been regularly introduced to you, and all that,\"\nresponded Mr. Magee, \"I could make a very flattering reply.\" And a true\none, he added to himself. For even in the faint flickering light of the\nstation he found ample reason for rejoicing that the bit of cambric was\nno longer agonizingly pressed. As yet he had scarcely looked away from\nher eyes, but he was dimly aware that up above wisps of golden hair\npeeped impudently from beneath a saucy black hat. He would look at those\nwisps shortly, he told himself. As soon as he could look away from the\neyes--which was not just yet.\n\n\"My grief,\" said the girl, \"is utterly silly and--womanish. I think it\nwould be best to leave me alone with it. Thank you for your interest.\nAnd--would you mind asking the gentleman who is pressing his face so\nfeverishly against the bars to kindly close his window?\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" replied Mr. Magee. He turned away. As he did so he collided\nwith a rather excessive lady. She gave the impression of solidity and\nbulk; her mouth was hard and knowing. Mr. Magee felt that she wanted to\nvote, and that she would say as much from time to time. The lady had a\nglittering eye; she put it to its time-honored use and fixed Mr. Magee\nwith it.\n\n\"I was crying, mamma,\" the girl explained, \"and this gentleman inquired\nif he could be of any service.\"\n\nMamma! Mr. Magee wanted to add his tears to those of the girl. This\nfrail and lovely damsel in distress owning as her maternal parent a\nheavy unnecessary--person! The older woman also had yellow hair, but it\nwas the sort that suggests the white enamel pallor of a drug store, with\nthe soda-fountain fizzing and the bottles of perfume ranged in an\nodorous row. Mamma! Thus rolled the world along.\n\n\"Well, they ain't no use gettin' all worked up for nothing,\" advised the\nunpleasant parent. Mr. Magee was surprised that in her tone there was no\nhostility to him--thus belying her looks. \"Mebbe the gentleman can\ndirect us to a good hotel,\" she added, with a rather stagy smile.\n\n\"I'm a stranger here, too,\" Mr. Magee replied. \"I'll interview the man\nover there in the cage.\"\n\nThe gentleman referred to was not cheerful in his replies. There was, he\nsaid, Baldpate Inn.\n\n\"Oh, yes, Baldpate Inn,\" repeated Billy Magee with interest.\n\n\"Yes, that's a pretty swell place,\" said the ticket agent. \"But it ain't\nopen now. It's a summer resort. There ain't no place open now but the\nCommercial House. And I wouldn't recommend no human being\nthere--especially no lady who was sad before she ever saw it.\"\n\nMr. Magee explained to the incongruous family pair waiting on the bench.\n\n\"There's only one hotel,\" he said, \"and I'm told it's not exactly the\nplace for any one whose outlook on life is not rosy at the moment. I'm\nsorry.\"\n\n\"It will do very well,\" answered the girl, \"whatever it is.\" She smiled\nat Billy Magee. \"My outlook on life in Upper Asquewan Falls,\" she said,\n\"grows rosier every minute. We must find a cab.\"\n\nShe began to gather up her traveling-bags, and Mr. Magee hastened to\nassist. The three went out on the station platform, upon which lay a\nthin carpet of snowflakes. There the older woman, in a harsh rasping\nvoice, found fault with Upper Asquewan Falls,--its geography, its public\nspirit, its brand of weather. A dejected cab at the end of the platform\nstood mourning its lonely lot. In it Mr. Magee placed the large lady and\nthe bags. Then, while the driver climbed to his seat, he spoke into the\ninvisible ear of the girl.\n\n\"You haven't told me why you cried,\" he reminded her.\n\nShe waved her hand toward the wayside village, the lamps of which shone\nsorrowfully through the snow.\n\n\"Upper Asquewan Falls,\" she said, \"isn't it reason enough?\"\n\nBilly Magee looked; saw a row of gloomy buildings that seemed to list as\nthe wind blew, a blurred sign \"Liquors and Cigars,\" a street that\nstaggered away into the dark like a man who had lingered too long at the\nemporium back of the sign.\n\n\"Are you doomed to stay here long?\" he asked.\n\n\"Come on, Mary,\" cried a deep voice from the cab. \"Get in and shut the\ndoor. I'm freezing.\"\n\n\"It all depends,\" said the girl. \"Thank you for being so kind and--good\nnight.\"\n\nThe door closed with a muffled bang, the cab creaked wearily away, and\nMr. Magee turned back to the dim waiting-room.\n\n\"Well, what was she crying for?\" inquired the ticket agent, when Mr.\nMagee stood again at his cell window.\n\n\"She didn't think much of your town,\" responded Magee; \"she intimated\nthat it made her heavy of heart.\"\n\n\"H'm--it ain't much of a place,\" admitted the man, \"though it ain't the\ngeneral rule with visitors to burst into tears at sight of it. Yes,\nUpper Asquewan is slow, and no mistake. It gets on my nerves sometimes.\nNothing to do but work, work, work, and then lay down and wait for\nto-morrow. I used to think maybe some day they'd transfer me down to\nHooperstown--there's moving pictures and such goings-on down there. But\nthe railroad never notices you--unless you go wrong. Yes, sir, sometimes\nI want to clear out of this town myself.\"\n\n\"A natural wanderlust,\" sympathized Mr. Magee. \"You said something just\nnow about Baldpate Inn--\"\n\n\"Yes, it's a little more lively in summer, when that's open,\" answered\nthe agent; \"we get a lot of complaints about trunks not coming, from\npretty swell people, too. It sort of cheers things.\" His eye roamed with\ninterest over Mr. Magee's New York attire. \"But Baldpate Inn is shut up\ntight now. This is nothing but an annex to a graveyard in winter. You\nwasn't thinking of stopping off here, was you?\"\n\n\"Well--I want to see a man named Elijah Quimby,\" Mr. Magee replied. \"Do\nyou know him?\"\n\n\"Of course,\" said the yearner for pastures new, \"he's caretaker of the\ninn. His house is about a mile out, on the old Miller Road that leads up\nBaldpate. Come outside and I'll tell you how to get there.\"\n\nThe two men went out into the whirling snow, and the agent waved a hand\nindefinitely up at the night.\n\n\"If it was clear,\" he said, \"you could see Baldpate Mountain, over\nyonder, looking down on the Falls, sort of keeping an eye on us to make\nsure we don't get reckless. And half-way up you'd see Baldpate Inn,\nblack and peaceful and winter-y. Just follow this street to the third\ncorner, and turn to your left. Elijah lives in a little house back among\nthe trees a mile out--there's a gate you'll sure hear creaking on a\nnight like this.\"\n\nBilly Magee thanked him, and gathering up his two bags, walked up \"Main\nStreet.\" A dreary forbidding building at the first corner bore the sign\n\"Commercial House\". Under the white gaslight in the office window three\nborn pessimists slouched low in hotel chairs, gazing sourly out at the\nstorm.\n\n    \"Weep no more, my lady,\n    Oh! weep no more to-day,\"\n\nhummed Mr. Magee cynically under his breath, and glanced up at the\nsolitary up-stairs window that gleamed yellow in the night.\n\nAt a corner on which stood a little shop that advertised \"Groceries and\nProvisions\" he paused.\n\n\"Let me see,\" he pondered. \"The lights will be turned off, of course.\nCandles. And a little something for the inner man, in case it's the\nclosed season for cooks.\"\n\nHe went inside, where a weary old woman served him.\n\n\"What sort of candles?\" she inquired, with the air of one who had an\ninfinite variety in stock. Mr. Magee remembered that Christmas was near.\n\n\"For a Christmas tree,\" he explained. He asked for two hundred.\n\n\"I've only got forty,\" the woman said. \"What's this tree for--the\nOrphans' Home?\"\n\nWith the added burden of a package containing his purchases in the tiny\nstore, Mr. Magee emerged and continued his journey through the stinging\nsnow. Upper Asquewan Falls on its way home for supper flitted past him\nin the silvery darkness. He saw in the lighted windows of many of the\nhouses the green wreath of Christmas cheer. Finally the houses became\ninfrequent, and he struck out on an uneven road that wound upward. Once\nhe heard a dog's faint bark. Then a carriage lurched by him, and a\nstrong voice cursed the roughness of the road. Mr. Magee half smiled to\nhimself as he strode on.\n\n\"Don Quixote, my boy,\" he muttered, \"I know how you felt when you moved\non the windmills.\"\n\nIt was not the whir of windmills but the creak of a gate in the storm\nthat brought Mr. Magee at last to a stop. He walked gladly up the path\nto Elijah Quimby's door.\n\nIn answer to Billy Magee's gay knock, a man of about sixty years\nappeared. Evidently he had just finished supper; at the moment he was\nengaged in lighting his pipe. He admitted Mr. Magee into the intimacy of\nthe kitchen, and took a number of calm judicious puffs on the pipe\nbefore speaking to his visitor. In that interval the visitor cheerily\nseized his hand, oblivious of the warm burnt match that was in it. The\nmatch fell to the floor, whereupon the older man cast an anxious glance\nat a gray-haired woman who stood beside the kitchen stove.\n\n\"My name's Magee,\" blithely explained that gentleman, dragging in his\nbags. \"And you're Elijah Quimby, of course. How are you? Glad to see\nyou.\" His air was that of one who had known this Quimby intimately, in\nmany odd corners of the world.\n\nThe older man did not reply, but regarded Mr. Magee wonderingly through\nwhite puffs of smoke. His face was kindly, gentle, ineffectual; he\nseemed to lack the final \"punch\" that send men over the line to success;\nthis was evident in the way his necktie hung, the way his thin hands\nfluttered.\n\n\"Yes,\" he admitted at last. \"Yes, I'm Quimby.\"\n\nMr. Magee threw back his coat, and sprayed with snow Mrs. Quimby's\nimmaculate floor.\n\n\"I'm Magee,\" he elucidated again, \"William Hallowell Magee, the man Hal\nBentley wrote to you about. You got his letter, didn't you?\"\n\nMr. Quimby removed his pipe and forgot to close the aperture as he\nstared in amazement.\n\n\"Good lord!\" he cried, \"you don't mean--you've really come.\"\n\n\"What better proof could you ask,\" said Mr. Magee flippantly, \"than my\npresence here?\"\n\n\"Why,\" stammered Mr. Quimby, \"we--we thought it was all a joke.\"\n\n\"Hal Bentley has his humorous moments,\" agreed Mr. Magee, \"but it isn't\nhis habit to fling his jests into Upper Asquewan Falls.\"\n\n\"And--and you're really going to--\" Mr. Quimby could get no further.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Mr. Magee brightly, slipping into a rocking-chair. \"Yes, I'm\ngoing to spend the next few months at Baldpate Inn.\"\n\nMrs. Quimby, who seemed to have settled into a stout little mound of a\nwoman through standing too long in the warm presence of her stove, came\nforward and inspected Mr. Magee.\n\n\"Of all things,\" she murmured.\n\n\"It's closed,\" expostulated Mr. Quimby; \"the inn is closed, young\nfellow.\"\n\n\"I know it's closed,\" smiled Magee. \"That's the very reason I'm going to\nhonor it with my presence. I'm sorry to take you out on a night like\nthis, but I'll have to ask you to lead me up to Baldpate. I believe\nthose were Hal Bentley's instructions--in the letter.\"\n\nMr. Quimby towered above Mr. Magee, a shirt-sleeved statue of honest\nAmerican manhood. He scowled.\n\n\"Excuse a plain question, young man,\" he said, \"but what are you hiding\nfrom?\"\n\nMrs. Quimby, in the neighborhood of the stove, paused to hear the reply.\nBilly Magee laughed.\n\n\"I'm not hiding,\" he said. \"Didn't Bentley explain? Well, I'll try to,\nthough I'm not sure you'll understand. Sit down, Mr. Quimby. You are\nnot, I take it, the sort of man to follow closely the light and\nfrivolous literature of the day.\"\n\n\"What's that?\" inquired Mr. Quimby.\n\n\"You don't read,\" continued Mr. Magee, \"the sort of novels that are sold\nby the pound in the department stores. Now, if you had a daughter--a\nfluffy daughter inseparable from a hammock in the summer--she could help\nme explain. You see--I write those novels. Wild thrilling tales for the\ntired business man's tired wife--shots in the night, chases after\nfortunes, Cupid busy with his arrows all over the place! It's good fun,\nand I like to do it. There's money in it.\"\n\n\"Is there?\" asked Mr. Quimby with a show of interest.\n\n\"Considerable,\" replied Mr. Magee. \"But now and then I get a longing to\ndo something that will make the critics sit up--the real thing, you\nknow. The other day I picked up a newspaper and found my latest\nbrain-child advertised as 'the best fall novel Magee ever wrote'. It got\non my nerves--I felt like a literary dressmaker, and I could see my\npublic laying down my fall novel and sighing for my early spring styles\nin fiction. I remembered that once upon a time a critic advised me to go\naway for ten years to some quiet spot, and think. I decided to do it.\nBaldpate Inn is the quiet spot.\"\n\n\"You don't mean,\" gasped Mr. Quimby, \"that you're going to stay there\nten years?\"\n\n\"Bless you, no,\" said Mr. Magee. \"Critics exaggerate. Two months will\ndo. They say I am a cheap melodramatic ranter. They say I don't go deep.\nThey say my thinking process is a scream. I'm afraid they're right. Now,\nI'm going to go up to Baldpate Inn, and think. I'm going to get away\nfrom melodrama. I'm going to do a novel so fine and literary that Henry\nCabot Lodge will come to me with tears in his eyes and ask me to join\nhis bunch of self-made Immortals. I'm going to do all this up there at\nthe inn--sitting on the mountain and looking down on this little old\nworld as Jove looked down from Olympus.\"\n\n\"I don't know who you mean,\" objected Mr. Quimby.\n\n\"He was a god--the god of the fruit-stand men,\" explained Magee.\n\"Picture me, if you can, depressed by the overwhelming success of my\nlatest brain-child. Picture me meeting Hal Bentley in a Forty-fourth\nStreet club and asking him for the location of the lonesomest spot on\nearth. Hal thought a minute. 'I've got it', he said, 'the lonesomest\nspot that's happened to date is a summer resort in mid-winter. It makes\nCrusoe's island look like Coney on a warm Sunday afternoon in\ncomparison.' The talk flowed on, along with other things. Hal told me\nhis father owned Baldpate Inn, and that you were an old friend of his\nwho would be happy for the entire winter over the chance to serve him.\nHe happened to have a key to the place--the key to the big front door, I\nguess, from the weight of it--and he gave it to me. He also wrote you to\nlook after me. So here I am.\"\n\nMr. Quimby ran his fingers through his white hair.\n\n\"Here I am,\" repeated Billy Magee, \"fleeing from the great glitter known\nas Broadway to do a little rational thinking in the solitudes. It's\ngetting late, and I suggest that we start for Baldpate Inn at once.\"\n\n\"This ain't exactly--regular,\" Mr. Quimby protested. \"No, it ain't what\nyou might call a frequent occurrence. I'm glad to do anything I can for\nyoung Mr. Bentley, but I can't help wondering what his father will say.\nAnd there's a lot of things you haven't took into consideration.\"\n\n\"There certainly is, young man,\" remarked Mrs. Quimby, bustling forward.\n\"How are you going to keep warm in that big barn of a place?\"\n\n\"The suites on the second floor,\" said Mr. Magee, \"are, I hear, equipped\nwith fireplaces. Mr. Quimby will keep me supplied with fuel from the\nforest primeval, for which service he will receive twenty dollars a\nweek.\"\n\n\"And light?\" asked Mrs. Quimby.\n\n\"For the present, candles. I have forty in that package. Later, perhaps\nyou can find me an oil lamp. Oh, everything will be provided for.\"\n\n\"Well,\" remarked Mr. Quimby, looking in a dazed fashion at his wife, \"I\nreckon I'll have to talk it over with ma.\"\n\nThe two retired to the next room, and Mr. Magee fixed his eyes on a \"God\nBless Our Home\" motto while he awaited their return. Presently they\nreappeared.\n\n\"Was you thinking of eating?\" inquired Mrs. Quimby sarcastically, \"while\nyou stayed up there?\"\n\n\"I certainly was,\" smiled Mr. Magee. \"For the most part I will prepare\nmy own meals from cans and--er--jars--and such pagan sources. But now\nand then you, Mrs. Quimby, are going to send me something cooked as no\nother woman in the county can cook it. I can see it in your eyes. In my\npoor way I shall try to repay you.\"\n\nHe continued to smile into Mrs. Quimby's broad cheerful face. Mr. Magee\nhad the type of smile that moves men to part with ten until Saturday,\nand women to close their eyes and dream of Sir Launcelot. Mrs. Quimby\ncould not long resist. She smiled back. Whereupon Billy Magee sprang to\nhis feet.\n\n\"It's all fixed,\" he cried. \"We'll get on splendidly. And now--for\nBaldpate Inn.\"\n\n\"Not just yet,\" said Mrs. Quimby. \"I ain't one to let anybody go up to\nBaldpate Inn unfed. I 'spose we're sort o' responsible for you, while\nyou're up here. You just set right down and I'll have your supper hot\nand smoking on the table in no time.\"\n\nMr. Magee entered into no dispute on this point, and for half an hour he\nwas the pleased recipient of advice, philosophy, and food. When he had\nassured Mrs. Quimby that he had eaten enough to last him the entire two\nmonths he intended spending at the inn, Mr. Quimby came in, attired in a\nhuge \"before the war\" ulster, and carrying a lighted lantern.\n\n\"So you're going to sit up there and write things,\" he commented. \"Well,\nI reckon you'll be left to yourself, all right.\"\n\n\"I hope so,\" responded Mr. Magee. \"I want to be so lonesome I'll sob\nmyself to sleep every night. It's the only road to immortality. Good-by,\nMrs. Quimby. In my fortress on the mountain I shall expect an occasional\nculinary message from you.\" He took her plump hand; this motherly little\nwoman seemed the last link binding him to the world of reality.\n\n\"Good-by,\" smiled Mrs. Quimby. \"Be careful of matches.\"\n\nMr. Quimby led the way with the lantern, and presently they stepped out\nupon the road. The storm had ceased, but it was still very dark. Far\nbelow, in the valley, twinkled the lights of Upper Asquewan Falls.\n\n\"By the way, Quimby,\" remarked Mr. Magee, \"is there a girl in your town\nwho has blue eyes, light hair, and the general air of a queen out\nshopping?\"\n\n\"Light hair,\" repeated Quimby. \"There's Sally Perry. She teaches in the\nMethodist Sunday-school.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Mr. Magee. \"My description was poor, I'm afraid. This one I\nrefer to, when she weeps, gives the general effect of mist on the sea at\ndawn. The Methodists do not monopolize her.\"\n\n\"I read books, and I read newspapers,\" said Mr. Quimby, \"but a lot of\nyour talk I don't understand.\"\n\n\"The critics,\" replied Billy Magee, \"could explain. My stuff is only for\nlow-brows. Lead on, Mr. Quimby.\"\n\nMr. Quimby stood for a moment in dazed silence. Then he turned, and the\nyellow of his lantern fell on the dazzling snow ahead. Together the two\nclimbed Baldpate Mountain.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nENTER A LOVELORN HABERDASHER\n\n\nBaldpate Inn did not stand tiptoe on the misty mountain-top. Instead it\nclung with grim determination to the side of Baldpate, about half-way\nup, much as a city man clings to the running board of an open\nstreet-car. This was the comparison Mr. Magee made, and even as he made\nit he knew that atmospheric conditions rendered it questionable. For an\nopen street-car suggests summer and the ball park; Baldpate Inn, as it\nshouldered darkly into Mr. Magee's ken, suggested winter at its most\nwintry.\n\nAbout the great black shape that was the inn, like arms, stretched broad\nverandas. Mr. Magee remarked upon them to his companion.\n\n\"Those porches and balconies and things,\" he said, \"will come in handy\nin cooling the fevered brow of genius.\"\n\n\"There ain't much fever in this locality,\" the practical Quimby assured\nhim, \"especially not in winter.\"\n\nSilenced, Mr. Magee followed the lantern of Quimby over the snow to the\nbroad steps, and up to the great front door. There Magee produced from\nbeneath his coat an impressive key. Mr. Quimby made as though to assist,\nbut was waved aside.\n\n\"This is a ceremony,\" Mr. Magee told him, \"some day Sunday newspaper\nstories will be written about it. Baldpate Inn opening its doors to the\ngreat American novel!\"\n\nHe placed the key in the lock, turned it, and the door swung open. The\ncoldest blast of air Mr. Magee had even encountered swept out from the\ndark interior. He shuddered, and wrapped his coat closer. He seemed to\nsee the white trail from Dawson City, the sled dogs straggling on with\nthe dwindling provisions, the fat Eskimo guide begging for gum-drops by\nhis side.\n\n\"Whew,\" he cried, \"we've discovered another Pole!\"\n\n\"It's stale air,\" remarked Quimby.\n\n\"You mean the Polar atmosphere,\" replied Magee. \"Yes, it is pretty\nstale. Jack London and Doctor Cook have worked it to death.\"\n\n\"I mean,\" said Quimby, \"this air has been in here alone too long. It's\nas stale as last week's newspaper. We couldn't heat it with a million\nfires. We'll have to let in some warm air from outside first.\"\n\n\"Warm air--humph,\" remarked Mr. Magee. \"Well, live and learn.\"\n\nThe two stood together in a great bare room. The rugs had been removed,\nand such furniture as remained had huddled together, as if for warmth,\nin the center of the floor. When they stepped forward, the sound of\ntheir shoes on the hard wood seemed the boom that should wake the dead.\n\n\"This is the hotel office,\" explained Mr. Quimby.\n\nAt the left of the door was the clerk's desk; behind it loomed a great\nsafe, and a series of pigeon-holes for the mail of the guests. Opposite\nthe front door, a wide stairway led to a landing half-way up, where the\nstairs were divorced and went to the right and left in search of the\nfloor above. Mr. Magee surveyed the stairway critically.\n\n\"A great place,\" he remarked, \"to show off the talents of your\ndressmaker, eh, Quimby? Can't you just see the stunning gowns coming\ndown that stair in state, and the young men below here agitated in their\nbosoms?\"\n\n\"No, I can't,\" said Mr. Quimby frankly.\n\n\"I can't either, to tell the truth,\" laughed Billy Magee. He turned up\nhis collar. \"It's like picturing a summer girl sitting on an iceberg and\nswinging her open-work hosiery over the edge. I don't suppose it's\nnecessary to register. I'll go right up and select my apartments.\"\n\nIt was upon a suite of rooms that bore the number seven on their door\nthat Mr. Magee's choice fell. A large parlor with a fireplace that a few\nblazing logs would cheer, a bedroom whose bed was destitute of all save\nmattress and springs, and a bathroom, comprised his kingdom. Here, too,\nall the furniture was piled in the center of the rooms. After Quimby had\nopened the windows, he began straightening the furniture about.\n\nMr. Magee inspected his apartment. The windows were all of the low\nFrench variety, and opened out upon a broad snow-covered balcony which\nwas in reality the roof of the first floor veranda. On this balcony\nMagee stood a moment, watching the trees on Baldpate wave their black\narms in the wind, and the lights of Upper Asquewan Falls wink knowingly\nup at him. Then he came inside, and his investigations brought him,\npresently to the tub in the bathroom.\n\n\"Fine,\" he cried, \"a cold plunge in the morning before the daily\nstruggle for immortality begins.\"\n\nHe turned the spigot. Nothing happened.\n\n\"I reckon,\" drawled Mr. Quimby from the bedroom, \"you'll carry your cold\nplunge up from the well back of the inn before you plunge into it. The\nwater's turned off. We can't take chances with busted pipes.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" replied Magee less blithely. His ardor was somewhat\ndampened--a paradox--by the failure of the spigot to gush forth a\nresponse. \"There's nothing I'd enjoy more than carrying eight pails of\nwater up-stairs every morning to get up an appetite for--what? Oh, well,\nthe Lord will provide. If we propose to heat up the great American\noutdoors, Quimby, I think it's time we had a fire.\"\n\nMr. Quimby went out without comment, and left Magee to light his first\ncandle in the dark. For a time he occupied himself with lighting a few\nof the forty, and distributing them about the room. Soon Quimby came\nback with kindling and logs, and subsequently a noisy fire roared in the\ngrate. Again Quimby retired, and returned with a generous armful of\nbedding, which he threw upon the brass bed in the inner room. Then he\nslowly closed and locked the windows, after which he came and looked\ndown with good-natured contempt at Mr. Magee, who sat in a chair before\nthe fire.\n\n\"I wouldn't wander round none,\" he advised. \"You might fall down\nsomething--or something. I been living in these parts, off and on, for\nsixty years and more, and nothing like this ever came under my\nobservation before. Howsomever, I guess it's all right if Mr. Bentley\nsays so. I'll come up in the morning and see you down to the train.\"\n\n\"What train?\" inquired Mr. Magee.\n\n\"Your train back to New York City,\" replied Mr. Quimby. \"Don't try to\nstart back in the night. There ain't no train till morning.\"\n\n\"Ah, Quimby,\" laughed Mr. Magee, \"you taunt me. You think I won't stick\nit out. But I'll show you. I tell you, I'm hungry for solitude.\"\n\n\"That's all right,\" Mr. Quimby responded, \"you can't make three square\nmeals a day off solitude.\"\n\n\"I'm desperate,\" said Magee. \"Henry Cabot Lodge must come to me, I say,\nwith tears in his eyes. Ever see the senator that way? No? It isn't\ngoing to be an easy job. I must put it over. I must go deep into the\nhearts of men, up here, and write what I find. No more shots in the\nnight. Just the adventure of soul and soul. Do you see? By the way,\nhere's twenty dollars, your first week's pay as caretaker of a New York\nQuixote.\"\n\n\"What's that?\" asked Quimby.\n\n\"Quixote,\" explained Mr. Magee, \"was a Spanish lad who was a little\nconfused in his mind, and went about the country putting up at summer\nresorts in mid-winter.\"\n\n\"I'd expect it of a Spaniard,\" Quimby said. \"Be careful of that fire.\nI'll be up in the morning.\" He stowed away the bill Mr. Magee had given\nhim. \"I guess nothing will interfere with your lonesomeness. Leastways,\nI hope it won't. Good night.\"\n\nMr. Magee bade the man good night, and listened to the thump of his\nboots, and the closing of the great front door. From his windows he\nwatched the caretaker move down the road without looking back, to\ndisappear at last in the white night.\n\nThrowing off his great coat, Mr. Magee noisily attacked the fire. The\nblaze flared red on his strong humorous mouth, in his smiling eyes.\nNext, in the flickering half-light of suite seven, he distributed the\ncontents of his traveling-bags about. On the table he placed a number of\nnew magazines and a few books.\n\nThen Mr. Magee sat down in the big leather chair before the fire, and\ncaught his breath. Here he was at last. The wild plan he and Hal Bentley\nhad cooked up in that Forty-fourth Street club had actually come to be.\n\"Seclusion,\" Magee had cried. \"Bermuda,\" Bentley had suggested. \"A\nmixture of sea, hotel clerks, and honeymooners!\" the seeker for solitude\nhad sneered. \"Some winter place down South,\"--from Bentley. \"And a\nflirtation lurking in every corner!\"--from Magee. \"A country town where\nyou don't know any one.\" \"The easiest place in the world to get\nacquainted. I must be alone, man! Alone!\" \"Baldpate Inn,\" Bentley had\ncried in his idiom. \"Why, Billy--Baldpate Inn at Christmas--it must be\nold John H. Seclusion himself.\"\n\nYes, here he was. And here was the solitude he had come to find. Mr.\nMagee looked nervously about, and the smile died out of his gray eyes.\nFor the first time misgivings smote him. Might one not have too much of\na good thing? A silence like that of the tomb had descended. He recalled\nstories of men who went mad from loneliness. What place lonelier than\nthis? The wind howled along the balcony. It rattled the windows. Outside\nhis door lay a great black cave--in summer gay with men and maids--now\nlike Crusoe's island before the old man landed.\n\n\"Alone, alone, all, all alone,\" quoted Mr. Magee. \"If I can't think here\nit will be because I'm not equipped with the apparatus. I will. I'll\nshow the gloomy old critics! I wonder what's doing in New York?\"\n\nNew York! Mr. Magee looked at his watch. Eight o'clock. The great street\nwas ablaze. The crowds were parading from the restaurants to the\ntheaters. The electric signs were pasting lurid legends on a long\nsuffering sky; the taxis were spraying throats with gasoline; the\ntraffic cop at Broadway and Forty-second Street was madly earning his\npay. Mr. Magee got up and walked the floor. New York!\n\nProbably the telephone in his rooms was jangling, vainly calling forth\nto sport with Amaryllis in the shade of the rubber trees Billy\nMagee--Billy Magee who sat alone in the silence on Baldpate Mountain.\nFew knew of his departure. This was the night of that stupid attempt at\ntheatricals at the Plaza; stupid in itself but gay, almost giddy, since\nHelen Faulkner was to be there. This was the night of the dinner to\nCarey at the club. This was the night--of many diverting things.\n\nMr. Magee picked up a magazine. He wondered how they read, in the old\ndays, by candlelight. He wondered if they would have found his own\nstories worth the strain on the eyes. And he also wondered if absolute\nsolitude was quite the thing necessary to the composition of the novel\nthat should forever silence those who sneered at his ability.\n\nAbsolute solitude! Only the crackle of the fire, the roar of the wind,\nand the ticking of his watch bore him company. He strode to the window\nand looked down at the few dim lights that proclaimed the existence of\nUpper Asquewan Falls. Somewhere, down there, was the Commercial House.\nSomewhere the girl who had wept so bitterly in that gloomy little\nwaiting-room. She was only three miles away, and the thought cheered Mr.\nMagee. After all, he was not on a desert island.\n\nAnd yet--he was alone, intensely, almost painfully, alone. Alone in a\nvast moaning house that must be his only home until he could go back to\nthe gay city with his masterpiece. What a masterpiece! As though with a\nsurgeon's knife it would lay bare the hearts of men. No tricks of plot,\nno--\n\nMr. Magee paused. For sharply in the silence the bell of his room\ntelephone rang out.\n\nHe stood for a moment gazing in wonder, his heart beating swiftly, his\neyes upon the instrument on the wall. It was a house phone; he knew that\nit could only be rung from the switchboard in the hall below. \"I'm going\nmad already,\" he remarked, and took down the receiver.\n\nA blur of talk, an electric muttering, a click, and all was still.\n\nMr. Magee opened the door and stepped out into the shadows. He heard a\nvoice below. Noiselessly he crept to the landing, and gazed down into\nthe office. A young man sat at the telephone switchboard; Mr. Magee\ncould see in the dim light of a solitary candle that he was a person of\nrather hilarious raiment. The candle stood on the top of the safe, and\nthe door of the latter swung open. Sinking down on the steps in the\ndark, Mr. Magee waited.\n\n\"Hello,\" the young man was saying, \"how do you work this thing, anyhow?\nI've tried every peg but the right one. Hello--hello! I want long\ndistance--Reuton. 2876 West--Mr. Andy Rutter. Will you get him for me,\nsister?\"\n\nAnother wait--a long one--ensued. The candle sputtered. The young man\nfidgeted in his chair. At last he spoke again:\n\n\"Hello! Andy? Is that you, Andy? What's the good word? As quiet as the\ntomb of Napoleon. Shall I close up shop? Sure. What next? Oh, see here,\nAndy, I'd die up here. Did you ever hit a place like this in winter? I\ncan't--I--oh, well, if he says so. Yes. I could do that. But no longer.\nI couldn't stand it long. Tell him that. Tell him everything's O. K.\nYes. All right. Well, good night, Andy.\"\n\nHe turned away from the switchboard, and as he did so Mr. Magee walked\ncalmly down the stairs toward him. With a cry the young man ran to the\nsafe, threw a package inside, and swung shut the door. He turned the\nknob of the safe several times; then he faced Mr. Magee. The latter saw\nsomething glitter in his hand.\n\n\"Good evening,\" remarked Mr. Magee pleasantly.\n\n\"What are you doing here?\" cried the youth wildly.\n\n\"I live here,\" Mr. Magee assured him. \"Won't you come up to my\nroom--it's right at the head of the stairs. I have a fire, you know.\"\n\nBack into the young man's lean hawk-like face crept the assurance that\nbelonged with the gay attire he wore. He dropped the revolver into his\npocket, and smiled a sneering smile.\n\n\"You gave me a turn,\" he said. \"Of course you live here. Are any of the\nother guests about? And who won the tennis match to-day?\"\n\n\"You are facetious.\" Mr. Magee smiled too. \"So much the better. A lively\ncompanion is the very sort I should have ordered to-night. Come\nup-stairs.\"\n\nThe young man looked suspiciously about, his thin nose seemingly\nscenting plots. He nodded, and picked up the candle. \"All right,\" he\nsaid. \"But I'll have to ask you to go first. You know the way.\" His\nright hand sought the pocket into which the revolver had fallen.\n\n\"You honor my poor and drafty house,\" said Mr. Magee. \"This way.\"\n\nHe mounted the stairs. After him followed the youth of flashy\nhabiliments, looking fearfully about him as he went. He seemed surprised\nthat they came to Magee's room without incident. Inside, Mr. Magee drew\nup an easy chair before the fire, and offered his guest a cigar.\n\n\"You must be cold,\" he said. \"Sit here. 'A bad night, stranger' as they\nremark in stories.\"\n\n\"You've said it,\" replied the young man, accepting the cigar. \"Thanks.\"\nHe walked to the door leading into the hall and opened it about a foot.\n\"I'm afraid,\" he explained jocosely, \"we'll get to talking, and miss the\nbreakfast bell.\" He dropped into the chair, and lighted his cigar at a\ncandle end. \"Say, you never can tell, can you? Climbing up old Baldpate\nI thought to myself, that hotel certainly makes the Sahara Desert look\nlike a cozy corner. And here you are, as snug and comfortable and at\nhome as if you were in a Harlem flat. You never can tell. And what now?\nThe story of my life?\"\n\n\"You might relate,\" Mr. Magee told him, \"that portion of it that has led\nyou trespassing on a gentleman seeking seclusion at Baldpate Inn.\"\n\nThe stranger looked at Mr. Magee. He had an eye that not only looked,\nbut weighed, estimated, and classified. Mr. Magee met it smilingly.\n\n\"Trespassing, eh?\" said the young man. \"Far be it from me to quarrel\nwith a man who smokes as good cigars as you do--but there's something I\nhaven't quite doped out. That is--who's trespassing, me or you?\"\n\n\"My right here,\" said Mr. Magee, \"is indisputable.\"\n\n\"It's a big word,\" replied the other, \"but you can tack it to my right\nhere, and tell no lie. We can't dispute, so let's drop the matter. With\nthat settled, I'm encouraged to pour out the story of why you see me\nhere to-night, far from the madding crowd. Have you a stray tear? You'll\nneed it. It's a sad touching story, concerned with haberdashery and a\ntrusting heart, and a fair woman--fair, but, oh, how false!\"\n\n\"Proceed,\" laughed Mr. Magee. \"I'm an admirer of the vivid imagination.\nDon't curb yours, I beg of you.\"\n\n\"It's all straight,\" said the other in a hurt tone. \"Every word true. My\nname is Joseph Bland. My profession, until love entered my life, was\nthat of haberdasher and outfitter. In the city of Reuton, fifty miles\nfrom here, I taught the Beau Brummels of the thoroughfares what was\ndoing in London in the necktie line. I sold them coats with padded\nshoulders, and collars high and awe inspiring. I was happy, twisting a\npiece of silk over my hand to show them how it would look on their\nheaving bosoms. And then--she came.\"\n\nMr. Bland puffed on his cigar.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said, \"Arabella sparkled on the horizon of my life. When I\nhave been here in the quiet for about two centuries, maybe I can do\njustice to her beauty. I won't attempt to describe her now. I loved\nher--madly. She said I made a hit with her. I spent on her the profits\nof my haberdashery. I whispered--marriage. She didn't scream. I had my\nwedding necktie picked out from the samples of a drummer from Troy.\" He\npaused and looked at Mr. Magee. \"Have you ever stood, poised, on that\nbrink?\" he asked.\n\n\"Never,\" replied Magee. \"But go on. Your story attracts me, strangely.\"\n\n\"From here on--the tear I spoke of, please. There flashed on the scene a\nman she had known and loved in Jersey City. I said flashed. He did--just\nthat. A swell dresser--say, he had John Drew beat by two mauve neckties\nand a purple frock coat. I had a haberdashery back of me. No use. He\nout-dressed me. I saw that Arabella's love for me was waning. With his\nchamois-gloved hands that new guy fanned the ancient flame.\"\n\nHe paused. Emotion--or the smoke of the cigar--choked him.\n\n\"Let's make the short story shorter,\" he said. \"She threw me down. In my\nhaberdashery I thought it over. I was blue, bitter. I resolved on a\ndreadful step. In the night I wrote her a letter, and carried it down to\nthe box and posted it. Life without Arabella, said the letter, was\nShakespeare with Hamlet left out. It hinted at the river, carbolic acid,\nrevolvers. Yes, I posted it. And then--\"\n\n\"And then,\" urged Mr. Magee.\n\nMr. Bland felt tenderly of the horseshoe pin in his purple tie.\n\n\"This is just between us,\" he said. \"At that point the trouble began. It\ncame from my being naturally a very brave man. I could have died--easy.\nThe brave thing was to live. To go on, day after day, devoid of\nArabella--say, that took courage. I wanted to try it. I'm a courageous\nman, as I say.\"\n\n\"You seem so,\" Mr. Magee agreed.\n\n\"Lion-hearted,\" assented Mr. Bland. \"I determined to show my nerve, and\nlive. But there was my letter to Arabella. I feared she wouldn't\nappreciate my bravery--women are dull sometimes. It came to me maybe she\nwould be hurt if I didn't keep my word, and die. So I had to--disappear.\nI had a friend mixed up in affairs at Baldpate. No, I can't give his\nname. I told him my story. He was impressed by my spirit, as you have\nbeen. He gave me a key he had--the key of the door opening from the east\nveranda into the dining-room. So I came up here. I came here to be\nalone, to forgive and forget, to be forgot. And maybe to plan a new\nhaberdashery in distant parts.\"\n\n\"Was it your wedding necktie,\" asked Mr. Magee, \"that you threw into the\nsafe when you saw me coming?\"\n\n\"No,\" replied Mr. Bland, sighing deeply. \"A package of letters, written\nto me by Arabella at various times. I want to forget 'em. If I kept them\non hand, I might look at them from time to time. My great courage might\ngive way--you might find my body on the stairs. That's why I hid them.\"\n\nMr. Magee laughed, and stretched forth his hand.\n\n\"Believe me,\" he said, \"your touching confidence in me will not be\nbetrayed. I congratulate you on your narrative power. You want my story.\nWhy am I here? I am not sure that it is worthy to follow yours. But it\nhas its good points--as I have thought it out.\"\n\nHe went over to the table, and picked up a popular novel upon which his\ngaze had rested while the haberdasher spun his fabric of love and gloom.\nOn the cover was a picture of a very dashing maiden.\n\n\"Do you see that girl?\" he asked. \"She is beautiful, is she not? Even\nArabella, in her most splendid moments, could get a few points from her,\nI fancy. Perhaps you are not familiar with the important part such a\npicture plays in the success of a novel to-day. The truth is, however,\nthat the noble art of fiction writing has come to lean more and more\nheavily on its illustrators. The mere words that go with the pictures\ngrow less important every day. There are dozens of distinguished\nnovelists in the country at this moment who might be haberdashers if it\nweren't for the long, lean, haughty ladies who are scattered tastefully\nthrough their works.\"\n\nMr. Bland stirred uneasily.\n\n\"I can see you are at a loss to know what my search for seclusion and\nprivacy has to do with all this,\" continued Mr. Magee. \"I am an artist.\nFor years I have drawn these lovely ladies who make fiction salable to\nthe masses. Many a novelist owes his motor-car and his country house to\nmy brush. Two months ago, I determined to give up illustration forever,\nand devote my time to painting. I turned my back on the novelists. Can\nyou imagine what happened?\"\n\n\"My imagination's a little tired,\" apologized Mr. Bland.\n\n\"Never mind. I'll tell you. The leading authors whose work I had so long\nillustrated saw ruin staring them in the face. They came to me, on their\nknees, figuratively. They begged. They pleaded. They hid in the\nvestibule of my flat. I should say, my studio. They even came up in my\ndumb-waiter, having bribed the janitor. They wouldn't take no for an\nanswer. In order to escape them and their really pitiful pleadings, I\nhad to flee. I happened to have a friend involved in the management of\nBaldpate Inn. I am not at liberty to give his name. He gave me a key. So\nhere I am. I rely on you to keep my secret. If you perceive a novelist\nin the distance, lose no time in warning me.\"\n\nMr. Magee paused, chuckling inwardly. He stood looking down at the\nlovelorn haberdasher. The latter got to his feet, and solemnly took\nMagee's hand.\n\n\"I--I--oh, well, you've got me beat a mile, old man,\" he said.\n\n\"You don't mean to say--\" began the hurt Magee.\n\n\"Oh, that's all right,\" Mr. Bland assured him. \"I believe every word of\nit. It's all as real as the haberdashery to me. I'll keep my eye peeled\nfor novelists. What gets me is, when you boil our two fly-by-night\nstories down, I've come here to be alone. You want to be alone. We can't\nbe alone here together. One of us must clear out.\"\n\n\"Nonsense,\" answered Billy Magee. \"I'll be glad to have you here. Stay\nas long as you like.\"\n\nThe haberdasher looked Mr. Magee fully in the eye, and the latter was\nstartled by the hostility he saw in the other's face.\n\n\"The point is,\" said Mr. Bland, \"I don't want you here. Why? Maybe\nbecause you recall beautiful dames--on book covers--and in that way,\nArabella. Maybe--but what's the use? I put it simply. I got to be\nalone--alone on Baldpate Mountain. I won't put you out to-night--\"\n\n\"See here, my friend,\" cried Mr. Magee, \"your grief has turned your\nhead. You won't put me out to-night, or to-morrow. I'm here to stay.\nYou're welcome to do the same, if you like. But you stay--with me. I\nknow you are a man of courage--but it would take at least ten men of\ncourage to put me out of Baldpate Inn.\"\n\nThey stood eying each other for a moment. Bland's thin lips twisted into\na sneer. \"We'll see,\" he said. \"We'll settle all that in the morning.\"\nHis tone took on a more friendly aspect \"I'm going to pick out a downy\ncouch in one of these rooms,\" he said, \"and lay me down to sleep. Say, I\ncould greet a blanket like a long-lost friend.\"\n\nMr. Magee proffered some of the covers that Quimby had given him, and\naccompanied Mr. Bland to suite ten, across the hall. He explained the\nmatter of \"stale air\", and assisted in the opening of windows. The\nconversation was mostly facetious, and Mr. Bland's last remark concerned\nthe fickleness of woman. With a brisk good night, Mr. Magee returned to\nnumber seven.\n\nBut he made no move toward the chilly brass bed in the inner room.\nInstead he sat a long time by the fire. He reflected on the events of\nhis first few hours in that supposedly uninhabited solitude where he was\nto be alone with his thoughts. He pondered the way and manner of the\nflippant young man who posed as a lovelorn haberdasher, and under whose\nflippancy there was certainly an air of hostility. Who was Andy Rutter,\ndown in Reuton? What did the young man mean when he asked if he should\n\"close up shop\"? Who was the \"he\" from whom came the orders? and most\nimportant of all, what was in the package now resting in the great safe?\n\nMr. Magee smiled. Was this the stuff of which solitude was made? He\nrecalled the ludicrous literary tale he had invented to balance the\nmoving fiction of Arabella, and his smile grew broader. His imagination,\nat least, was in a healthy state. He looked at his watch. A quarter of\ntwelve. Probably they were having supper at the Plaza now, and Helen\nFaulkner was listening to the banalities of young Williams. He settled\nin his seat to think of Miss Faulkner. He thought of her for ten\nseconds; then stepped to the window.\n\nThe moon had risen, and the snowy roofs of Upper Asquewan Falls sparkled\nin the lime-light of the heavens. Under one of those roofs was the girl\nof the station--weeping no more, he hoped. Certainly she had eyes that\nheld even the least susceptible--to which class Mr. Magee prided himself\nhe belonged. He wished he might see her again; might talk to her without\ninterruption from that impossible \"mamma.\"\n\nMr. Magee turned back into the room. His fire was but red glowing ashes.\nHe threw off his dressing-gown, and began to unlace his shoes.\n\n\"There _has_ been too much crude melodrama in my novels,\" he reflected.\n\"It's so easy to write. But I'm going to get away from all that up here.\nI'm going--\"\n\nMr. Magee paused, with one shoe poised in his hand. For from below came\nthe sharp crack of a pistol, followed by the crash of breaking glass.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nBLONDES AND SUFFRAGETTES\n\n\nMr. Magee slipped into his dressing gown, seized a candle, and like the\nboy in the nursery rhyme with one shoe off and one shoe on, ran into the\nhall. All was silent and dark below. He descended to the landing, and\nstood there, holding the candle high above his head. It threw a dim\nlight as far as the bottom of the stairs, but quickly lost the battle\nwith the shadows that lay beyond.\n\n\"Hello,\" the voice of Bland, the haberdasher, came out of the blackness.\n\"The Goddess of Liberty, as I live! What's your next imitation?\"\n\n\"There seems to be something doing,\" said Mr. Magee.\n\nMr. Bland came into the light, partially disrobed, his revolver in his\nhand.\n\n\"Somebody trying to get in by the front door,\" he explained. \"I shot at\nhim to scare him away. Probably one of your novelists.\"\n\n\"Or Arabella,\" remarked Mr. Magee, coming down.\n\n\"No,\" answered Bland. \"I distinctly saw a derby hat.\"\n\nWith Mr. Magee descended the yellow candlelight, and brushing aside the\nshadows of the hotel office, it revealed a mattress lying on the floor\nclose to the clerk's desk, behind which stood the safe. On the mattress\nwas the bedding Magee had presented to the haberdasher, hastily thrown\nback by the lovelorn one on rising.\n\n\"You prefer to sleep down here,\" Mr. Magee commented.\n\n\"Near the letters of Arabella--yes,\" replied Bland. His keen eyes met\nMagee's. There was a challenge in them.\n\nMr. Magee turned, and the yellow light of the candle flickered wanly\nover the great front door Even as he looked at it, the door was pushed\nopen, and a queer figure of a man stood framed against a background of\nglittering snow. Mr. Bland's arm flew up.\n\n\"Don't shoot,\" cried Magee.\n\n\"No, please don't,\" urged the man in the doorway. A beard, a pair of\nround owlish spectacles, and two ridiculous ear-muffs, left only a\nsuggestion of face here and there. He closed the door and stepped into\nthe room. \"I have every right here, I assure you, even though my arrival\nis somewhat unconventional. See--I have the key.\" He held up a large\nbrass key that was the counterpart of the one Hal Bentley had bestowed\nupon Mr. Magee in that club on far-off Forty-fourth Street.\n\n\"Keys to burn,\" muttered Mr. Bland sourly.\n\n\"I bear no ill will with regard to the shooting,\" went on the newcomer.\nHe took off his derby hat and ruefully regarded a hole through the\ncrown. His bald head seemed singularly frank and naked above a face of\nso many disguises. \"It is only natural that men alone on a mountain\nshould defend themselves from invaders at two in the morning. My escape\nwas narrow, but there is no ill will.\"\n\nHe blinked about him, his breath a white cloud in the cold room.\n\n\"Life, young gentlemen,\" he remarked, setting down his bag and leaning a\ngreen umbrella against it, \"has its surprises even at sixty-two. Last\nnight I was ensconced by my own library fire, preparing a paper on the\nPagan Renaissance. To-night I am on Baldpate Mountain, with a\nperforation in my hat.\"\n\nMr. Bland shivered. \"I'm going back to bed,\" he said in disgust.\n\n\"First,\" went on the gentleman with the perforated derby, \"permit me to\nintroduce myself. I am Professor Thaddeus Bolton, and I hold the Chair\nof Comparative Literature in a big eastern university.\"\n\nMr. Magee took the mittened hand of the professor.\n\n\"Glad to see you, I'm sure,\" he said. \"My name is Magee. This is Mr.\nBland--he is impetuous but estimable. I trust you will forgive his first\nsalute. What's a bullet among gentlemen? It seems to me that as\nexplanations may be lengthy and this room is very cold, we would do well\nto go up to my room, where there is a fire.\"\n\n\"Delighted,\" cried the old man. \"A fire. I long to see one. Let us go to\nyour room, by all means.\"\n\nMr. Bland sulkily stalked to his mattress and secured a gaily colored\nbed quilt, which he wound about his thin form.\n\n\"This is positively the last experience meeting I attend to-night,\" he\ngrowled.\n\nThey ascended to number seven. Mr. Magee piled fresh logs on the fire;\nMr. Bland saw to it that the door was not tightly closed. The professor\nremoved, along with other impedimenta, his ear tabs, which were\nconnected by a rubber cord. He waved them like frisky detached ears\nbefore him.\n\n\"An old man's weakness,\" he remarked. \"Foolish, they may seem to you.\nBut I assure you I found them useful companions in climbing Baldpate\nMountain at this hour.\"\n\nHe sat down in the largest chair suite seven owned, and from its depths\nsmiled benignly at the two young men.\n\n\"But I am not here to apologize for my apparel, am I? Hardly. You are\nsaying to yourselves 'Why is he here?' Yes, that is the question that\ndisturbs you. What has brought this domesticated college professor\nscampering from the Pagan Renaissance to Baldpate Inn? For answer, I\nmust ask you to go back with me a week's time, and gaze at a picture\nfrom the rather dreary academic kaleidoscope that is my life.\n\n\"I am seated back of a desk on a platform in a bare yellow room. In\nfront of me, tier on tier, sit a hundred young men in various attitudes\nof inattention. I am trying to tell them something of the ideal poetry\nthat marked the rebirth of the Saxon genius. They are bored. I--well,\ngentlemen, in confidence, even the mind of a college professor has been\nknown to wander at times from the subject in hand. And then--I begin to\nread a poem--a poem descriptive of a woman dead six hundred years and\nmore. Ah, gentlemen--\"\n\nHe sat erect on the edge of his great chair. Back of the thick lenses of\nhis spectacles he had eyes that still could flash.\n\n\"This is not an era of romance,\" he said. \"Our people grub in the dirt\nfor the dollar. Their visions perish. Their souls grow stale. Yet, now\nand then, at most inopportune times, comes the flash that reveals to us\nthe glories that might be. A gentleman of my acquaintance caught a\nglimpse of perfect happiness while he was in the midst of an effort to\ncorner the pickle market. Another evolved the scheme of a perfect ode to\nthe essential purity of woman in--a Broadway restaurant. So, like\nlightning across the blackest sky, our poetic moments come.\"\n\nMr. Bland wrapped his gay quilt more securely about him. Mr. Magee\nsmiled encouragement on the newest raconteur.\n\n\"I shall be brief,\" continued Professor Bolton. \"Heaven knows that\npedagogic room was no place for visions, nor were those athletic young\nmen fit companions for a soul gone giddy. Yet--I lost my head. As I read\non there returned to my heart a glow I had not known in forty years. The\nbard spoke of her hair:\n\n    \"'Her yellow lockes, crisped like golden wyre,\n     About her shoulders weren loosely shed'\n\nand I saw, as in a dream--ahem, I can trust you, gentlemen--a girl I\nsupposed I had forever forgot in the mold and dust of my later years. I\nwill not go further into the matter. My wife's hair is black.\n\n\"And reading on, but losing the thread of the poet's eulogy in the\ngolden fabric of my resurrected dream, it came to me to compare that\nmaid I knew in the long ago with the women I know to-day. Ah, gentlemen!\nLips, made but for smiling, fling weighty arguments on the unoffending\natmosphere. Eyes, made to light with that light that never was by land\nor sea, blaze instead with what they call the injustice of woman's\nservitude. White hands, made to find their way to the hands of some\nyoung man in the moonlight, carry banners in the dusty streets. It\nseemed I saw the blue eyes of that girl of long ago turned, sad,\nrebuking, on her sisters of to-day. As I finished reading, my heart was\nawhirl. I said to the young men before me:\n\n\"'There _was_ a woman, gentlemen--a woman worth a million suffragettes.'\n\n\"They applauded. The fire in me died down. Soon I was my old meek,\nacademic self. The vision had left no trace. I dismissed my class and\nwent home. I found that my wife--she of the black hair--had left my\nslippers by the library fire. I put them on, and plunged into a pamphlet\nlately published by a distinguished member of a German university\nfaculty. I thought the incident closed forever.\"\n\nHe gazed sorrowfully at the two young men.\n\n\"But, gentlemen, I had not counted on that viper that we nourish in our\nbosom--the American newspaper. At present I will not take time to\ndenounce the press. I am preparing an article on the subject for a\nrespectable weekly of select circulation. Suffice it to record what\nhappened. The next day an evening paper appeared with a huge picture of\nme on its front page, and the hideous statement that this was the\nProfessor Bolton who had said that 'One Peroxide Blonde Is Worth a\nMillion Suffragettes'.\n\n\"Yes, that was the dreadful version of my remark that was spread\nbroadcast. Up to the time that story appeared, I had no idea as to what\nsort of creature the peroxide blonde might be. I protested, of course. I\nmight as well have tried to dam a tidal wave with a table fork. The\nwrath of the world swept down upon me. I was deluged with telegrams,\neditorials, letters, denouncing me. Firm-faced females lay in wait for\nme and waved umbrellas in my eyes. Even my wife turned from me, saying\nthat while she did not ask me to hold her views on the question of\nsuffrage, she thought I might at least refrain from publicly commending\na type of woman found chiefly in musical comedy choruses. I received a\nnote from the president of the university, asking me to be more\ncircumspect in my remarks. Me--Thadeus Bolton--the most conservative man\non earth by instinct!\n\n\"And still the denunciations of me poured in; still women's clubs held\nmeetings resolving against me; still a steady stream of reporters flowed\nthrough my life, urging me to state my views further, to name the ten\ngreatest blondes in history, to--heaven knows what. Yesterday I resolved\nI Could stand it no longer. I determined to go away until the whole\nthing was forgotten. 'But', they said to me, 'there is no place, on land\nor sea, where the reporters will not find you'. I talked the matter over\nwith my old friend, John Bentley, owner of Baldpate Inn, and he in his\nkindness gave me the key to this hostelry.\"\n\nThe old man paused and passed a silk handkerchief over his bald head.\n\n\"That, sirs,\" he said, \"is my story. That is why you see me on Baldpate\nMountain this chill December morning. That is why loneliness can have no\nterrors, exile no sorrows, for me. That is why I bravely faced your\nrevolver-shots. Again let me repeat, I bear no malice on that score. You\nhave ruined a new derby hat, and the honorarium of professor even at a\nleading university is not such as to permit of many purchases in that\nline. But I forgive you freely. Even at the cannon's mouth I would have\nfled from reputation, to paraphrase the poet.\"\n\nWisely Professor Bolton blinked about him. Mr. Bland was half asleep in\nhis chair, but Mr. Magee was quick with sympathy.\n\n\"Professor,\" he said, \"you are a much suffering man. I feel for you.\nHere, I am sure, you are safe from reporters, and the yellow journals\nwill soon forget you in their discovery of the next distorted wonder.\nBriefly, Mr. Bland and myself will outline the tangle of events that\nbrought us to the inn--\"\n\n\"Briefly is right,\" broke in Bland. \"And then it's me for that\nmountainous mattress of mine. I can rattle my story off in short order,\nand give you the fine points to-morrow. Up to a short time ago--\"\n\nBut Billy Magee interrupted. An idea, magnificent delicious, mirthful,\nhad come to him. Why not? He chuckled inwardly, but his face was most\nserious.\n\n\"I should like to tell my story first, if you please,\" he said.\n\nThe haberdasher grunted. The professor nodded. Mr. Magee looked Bland\nsquarely in the eye, strangled the laugh inside him, and began:\n\n\"Up to a short time ago I was a haberdasher in the city of Reuton. My\nname, let me state, is Magee--William Magee. I fitted the gay\nshoulder-blades of Reuton with clothing from the back pages of the\nmagazines, and as for neckties--\"\n\nMr. Bland's sly eyes had opened wide. He rose to a majestic\nheight--majestic considering the bed quilt.\n\n\"See here--\" he began.\n\n\"Please don't interrupt,\" requested Mr. Magee sweetly. \"I was, as I have\nsaid, a happy carefree haberdasher. And then--she entered my life.\nArabella was her name. Ah, Professor, you lady of the yellow locks,\ncrisped liken golden wire--even she must never in my presence be\ncompared with Arabella. She--she had--a--face--Noah Webster couldn't\nhave found words to describe it. And her heart was true to yours\ntruly--at least I thought that it was.\"\n\nMr. Magee rattled on. The haberdasher, his calling and his tragedy\nsnatched from him by the humorous Magee, retired with sullen face into\nhis bed quilt. Carefully Mr. Magee led up to the coming of the man from\nJersey City; in detail he laid bare the duel of haberdashery fought in\nthe name of the fair Arabella. As he proceeded, his enthusiasm grew. He\nadded fine bits that had escaped Mr. Bland. He painted with free hand\nthe picture of tragedy's dark hour; the note hinting at suicide he gave\nin full. Then he told of how his courage grew again, of how he put the\ncowardice of death behind him, resolved to dare all--and live. He\nfinished at last, his voice husky with emotion. Out of the corner of his\neye he glanced triumphantly at Bland. That gentleman was gazing\nthoughtfully at the blazing logs.\n\n\"You did quite right,\" commented Professor Bolton, \"in making up your\nmind to live. I congratulate you on your common sense. And perhaps, as\nthe years go by, you will realize that had you married your Arabella,\nyou would not have found life all honey and roses. She was fickle,\nunworthy of you. Soon you will forget. Youth--ah, youth throws off its\nsorrow like a cloak. A figure not original with me. And now--the\ngentleman in the--er--the bed quilt. Has he, too, a story?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" laughed Mr. Magee, \"let's hear now from the gentleman in the bed\nquilt. Has he, too, a story? And if so, what is it?\"\n\nHe smiled delightedly into the eyes of Bland. What would the\nex-haberdasher do, shorn of his fictional explanation? Would he rise in\nhis wrath and denounce the man who had stolen his Arabella? Mr. Bland\nsmiled back. He stood up. And a contingency that had not entered Mr.\nMagee's mind came to be.\n\nMr. Bland walked calmly to the table, and picked up a popular novel that\nlay thereon. On its cover was the picture of a very beautiful maiden.\n\n\"See that dame?\" he inquired of the professor. \"Sort of makes a man sit\nup and take notice, doesn't she? Even the frost-bitten haberdasher here\nhas got to admit that in some ways she has this Arabella person looking\nlike a faded chromo in your grandmother's parlor on a rainy afternoon.\nEver get any notion, Professor, the way a picture like that boosts a\nnovel in the busy marts of trade? No? Well--\"\n\nMr. Bland continued. Mr. Magee leaned back, overjoyed, in his chair.\nHere was a man not to be annoyed by the mere filching of his story. Here\nwas a man with a sense of humor--an opponent worthy his foe's best\nefforts. In his r\u00c3\u00b4le of a haberdasher overcome with woe, Mr. Magee\nlistened.\n\n\"I used to paint dames like that,\" Bland was saying to the dazed\nprofessor. He explained how his pictures had enabled many a novelist to\n\"eat up the highway in a buzz-wagon.\" As he approached the time when the\nnovelists besieged him, he gave full play to his imagination. One, he\nsaid, sought out his apartments in an aeroplane.\n\n\"Say, Professor,\" he finished, \"we're in the same boat. Both hiding from\nwriters. A fellow that's spent his life selling neckties--well, he can't\nexactly appreciate our situation. There's what you might call a bond\nbetween you and me. D'ye know, I felt drawn to you, just after I fired\nthat first shot. That's why I didn't blaze away again. We're going to be\ngreat friends--I can read it in the stars.\"\n\nHe took the older man's hand feelingly, shook it, and walked away,\ncasting a covert glance of triumph at Mr. Magee.\n\nThe face of the holder of the Crandall Chair of Comparative Literature\nwas a study. He looked first at one young man, then at the other. Again\nhe applied the handkerchief to his shining head.\n\n\"All this is very odd,\" he said thoughtfully. \"A man of\nsixty-two--particularly one who has long lived in the uninspired circle\nsurrounding a university--has not the quick wit of youth. I'm afraid I\ndon't--but no matter. It's very odd, though.\"\n\nHe permitted Mr. Magee to escort him into the hall, and to direct his\nsearch for a bed that should serve him through the scant remainder of\nthe night. Overcoats and rugs were pressed into service as cover. Mr.\nBland blithely assisted.\n\n\"If I see any newspaper reporters,\" he assured the professor on parting,\n\"I'll damage more than their derbies.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" replied the old man heartily. \"You are very kind. To-morrow\nwe shall become better acquainted. Good night.\"\n\nThe two young men came out and stood in the hallway. Mr. Magee spoke in\na low tone.\n\n\"Forgive me,\" he said, \"for stealing your Arabella.\"\n\n\"Take her and welcome,\" said Bland. \"She was beginning to bore me,\nanyhow. And I'm not in your class as an actor.\" He came close to Magee.\nIn the dim light that streamed out from number seven the latter saw the\nlook on his face, and knew that, underneath all, this was a very much\nworried young man.\n\n\"For God's sake,\" cried Bland, \"tell me who you are and what you're\ndoing here. In three words--tell me.\"\n\n\"If I did,\" Mr. Magee replied, \"you wouldn't believe me. Let such minor\nmatters as the truth wait over till to-morrow.\"\n\n\"Well, anyhow,\" Bland said, his foot on the top step, \"we are sure of\none thing--we don't trust each other. I've got one parting word for you.\nDon't try to come down-stairs to-night. I've got a gun, and I ain't\nafraid to shoot.\"\n\nHe paused. A look of fright passed over his face. For on the floor above\nthey both heard soft footsteps--then a faint click, as though a door had\nbeen gently closed.\n\n\"This inn,\" whispered Bland, \"has more keys than a literary club in a\nprohibition town. And every one's in use, I guess. Remember. Don't try\nto come down-stairs. I've warned you. Or Arabella's cast-off Romeo may\nbe found with a bullet in him yet.\"\n\n\"I shan't forget, what you say,\" answered Mr. Magee. \"Shall we look\nabout up-stairs?\"\n\nBland shook his head.\n\n\"No,\" he said. \"Go in and go to bed. It's the down-stairs that--that\nconcerns me. Good night.\"\n\nHe went swiftly down the steps, leaving Mr. Magee staring wonderingly\nafter him. Like a wraith he merged with the shadows below. Magee turned\nslowly, and entered number seven. A fantastic film of frost was on the\nwindows; the inner room was drear and chill. Partially undressing, he\nlay down on the brass bed and pulled the covers over him.\n\nThe events of the night danced in giddy array before him as he closed\nhis eyes. With every groan Baldpate Inn uttered in the wind he started\nup, keen for a new adventure. At length his mind seemed to stand still,\nand there remained of all that amazing evening's pictures but one--that\nof a girl in a blue corduroy suit who wept--wept only that her smile\nmight be the more dazzling when it flashed behind the tears. \"With\nyellow locks, crisped like golden wire,\" murmured Mr. Magee. And so he\nfell asleep.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nA PROFESSIONAL HERMIT APPEARS\n\n\nEvery morning at eight, when slumber's chains had bound Mr. Magee in his\nNew York apartments, he was awakened by a pompous valet named Geoffrey\nwhom he shared with the other young men in the building. It was\nGeoffrey's custom to enter, raise the curtains, and speak of the weather\nin a voice vibrant with feeling, as of something he had prepared himself\nand was anxious to have Mr. Magee try. So, when a rattling noise came to\nhis ear on his first morning at Baldpate Inn, Mr. Magee breathed\nsleepily from the covers: \"Good morning, Geoffrey.\"\n\nBut no cheery voice replied in terms of sun, wind, or rain. Surprised,\nMr. Magee sat up in bed. About him, the maple-wood furniture of suite\nseven stood shivering in the chill of a December morning. Through the\ndoor at his left he caught sight of a white tub into which, he recalled\nsadly, not even a Geoffrey could coax a glittering drop. Yes--he was at\nBaldpate Inn. He remembered--the climb with the dazed Quimby up the\nsnowy road, the plaint of the lovelorn haberdasher, the vagaries of the\nprofessor with a penchant for blondes, the mysterious click of the\ndoor-latch on the floor above. And last of all--strange that it should\nhave been last--a girl in blue corduroy somewhat darker than her eyes,\nwho wept amid the station's gloom.\n\n\"I wonder,\" reflected Mr. Magee, staring at the very brassy bars at the\nfoot of his bed, \"what new variations on seclusion the day will bring\nforth?\"\n\nAgain came the rattling noise that had awakened him. He looked toward\nthe nearest window, and through an unfrosted corner of the pane he saw\nthe eyes of the newest variation staring at him in wonder. They were\ndark eyes, and kindly; they spoke a desire to enter.\n\nRising from his warm retreat, Mr. Magee took his shivering way across\nthe uncarpeted floor and unfastened the window's catch. From the\nblustering balcony a plump little man stepped inside. He had a market\nbasket on his arm. His face was a stranger to razors; his hair to\nshears. He reminded Mr. Magee of the celebrated doctor who came every\nyear to the small town of his boyhood, there to sell a wonderful healing\nherb to the crowds on the street corner.\n\nMagee dived hastily back under the covers. \"Well?\" he questioned.\n\n\"So you're the fellow,\" remarked the little man in awe. He placed the\nbasket on the floor; it appeared to be filled with bromidic groceries,\nsuch as the most subdued householder carries home.\n\n\"Which fellow?\" asked Mr. Magee.\n\n\"The fellow Elijah Quimby told me about,\" explained he of the long brown\nlocks. \"The fellow that's come up to Baldpate Inn to be alone with his\nthoughts.\"\n\n\"You're one of the villagers, I take it,\" guessed Mr. Magee.\n\n\"You're dead wrong. I'm no villager. My instincts are all in the other\ndirection--away from the crowd. I live up near the top of Baldpate, in a\nlittle shack I built myself. My name's Peters--Jake Peters--in the\nwinter. But in the summer, when the inn's open, and the red and white\nawnings are out, and the band plays in the casino every night--then I'm\nthe Hermit of Baldpate Mountain. I come down here and sell picture\npost-cards of myself to the ladies.\"\n\nMr. Magee appeared overcome with mirth.\n\n\"A professional hermit, by the gods!\" he cried. \"Say, I didn't know\nBaldpate Mountain was fitted up with all the modern improvements. This\nis great luck. I'm an amateur at the hermit business, you'll have to\nteach me the fine points. Sit down.\"\n\n\"Just between ourselves, I'm not a regular hermit,\" said the plump\nbewhiskered one, sitting gingerly on the edge of a frail chair. \"Not one\nof these 'all for love of a woman' hermits you read about in books. Of\ncourse, I have to pretend I am, in summer, in order to sell the cards\nand do my whole duty by the inn management. A lot of the women ask me in\nsoft tones about the great disappointment that drove me to old Baldpate,\nand I give 'em various answers, according to how I feel. Speaking to you\nas a friend, and considering the fact that it's the dead of winter, I\nmay say there was little or no romance in my life. I married early, and\nstayed married a long time. I came up here for peace and quiet, and\nbecause I felt a man ought to read something besides time-tables and\ntradesmen's bills, and have something over his head besides a first and\nsecond mortgage.\"\n\n\"Back to nature, in other words,\" remarked Mr. Magee.\n\n\"Yes, sir--back with a rush. I was down to the village this morning for\na few groceries, and I stopped off at Quimby's, as I often do. He told\nme about you. I help him a lot around the inn, and we arranged I was to\nstop in and start your fire, and do any other little errands you might\nwant done. I thought we ought to get acquainted, you and me, being as\nwe're both literary men, after a manner of speaking.\"\n\n\"No?\" cried Mr. Magee.\n\n\"Yes,\" said the Hermit of Baldpate. \"I dip into that work a little now\nand then. Some of my verses on the joys of solitude have appeared in\nprint--on the post-cards I sell to the guests in the summer. But my\nlife-work, as you might call it, is a book I've had under way for some\ntime. It's called simply _Woman_. Just that one word--but, oh, the\nmeaning in it! That book is going to prove that all the trouble in the\nworld, from the beginning of time, was caused by females. Not just say\nso, mind you. Prove it!\"\n\n\"A difficult task, I'm afraid,\" smiled Magee.\n\n\"Not difficult--long,\" corrected the hermit. \"When I started out, four\nyears ago, I thought it would just be a case of a chapter on Eve, and\nhonorable mention for Cleopatra and Helen of Troy, and a few more like\nthat, and the thing would be done. But as I got into the subject, I was\nfairly buried under new evidence. Then Mr. Carnegie came along and gave\nUpper Asquewan Falls a library. It's wonderful to think the great works\nthat man will be responsible for. I've dedicated _Woman_ to him. Since\nthe new library, I've dug up information about a thousand disasters I\nnever dreamed of before, and I contend that if you go back a ways in any\none of 'em, you'll find the fluffy little lady that started the whole\nrumpus. So I hunt the woman. I reckon the French would call me the\ngreatest _cherchez la femme_ in history.\"\n\n\"A fascinating pursuit,\" laughed Mr. Magee. \"I'm glad you've told me\nabout it, and I shall watch the progress of the work with interest.\nAlthough I can't say that I entirely agree with you. Here and there is a\nwoman who more than makes amends for whatever trouble her sisters have\ncaused. One, for instance, with golden hair, and eyes that when they\nweep--\"\n\n\"You're young,\" interrupted the little man, rising. \"There ain't no use\nto debate it with you. I might as well try to argue with a storm at sea.\nSome men keep the illusion to the end of their days, and I hope you're\none. I reckon I'll start your fire.\"\n\nHe went into the outer room, and Mr. Magee lay for a few moments\nlistening to his preparations about the fireplace. This was comfort, he\nthought. And yet, something was wrong. Was it the growing feeling of\nemptiness inside? Undoubtedly. He sat up in bed and leaning over, gazed\ninto the hermit's basket. The packages he saw there made his feeling of\nemptiness the more acute.\n\n\"I say, Mr. Peters,\" he cried, leaping from bed and running into the\nother room, where the hermit was persuading a faint blaze, \"I've an\nidea. You can cook, can't you?\"\n\n\"Cook?\" repeated the hermit. \"Well, yes, I've had to learn a few things\nabout it, living far from the rathskellars the way I do.\"\n\n\"The very man,\" rejoiced Mr. Magee. \"You must stay here and cook for\nme--for us.\"\n\n\"Us?\" asked the hermit, staring.\n\n\"Yes. I forgot to tell you. After Mr. Quimby left me last night, two\nother amateur hermits hove in view. One is a haberdasher with a broken\nheart--\"\n\n\"Woman,\" cried the triumphant Peters.\n\n\"Name, Arabella,\" laughed Magee. \"The other's a college professor who\nmade an indiscreet remark about blondes. You won't mind them, I'm sure,\nand they may be able to help you a lot with your great work.\"\n\n\"I don't know what Quimby will say,\" studied the hermit. \"I reckon he'll\nrun 'em out. He's against this thing--afraid of fire.\"\n\n\"Quimby will come later,\" Mr. Magee assured him, drawing on a\ndressing-gown. \"Just now the idea is a little water in yonder tub, and a\nnice cheerful breakfast after. It's going to pay you a lot better than\nselling post-cards to romantic ladies, I promise you. I won't take you\naway from a work for which the world is panting without more than making\nit up to you financially. Where do you stand as a coffee maker?\"\n\n\"Wait till you taste it,\" said Peters reassuringly. \"I'll bring you up\nsome water.\"\n\nHe started for the door, but Mr. Magee preceded him.\n\n\"The haberdasher,\" he explained, \"sleeps below, and he's a nervous man.\nHe might commit the awful error of shooting the only cook on Baldpate\nMountain.\"\n\nMr. Magee went out into the hall and called from the depths the figure\nof Bland, fully attired in his flashy garments, and looking tawdry and\ntired in the morning light.\n\n\"I've been up hours,\" he remarked. \"Heard somebody knocking round the\nkitchen, but I ain't seen any breakfast brought in on a silver tray. My\ninside feels like the Mammoth Cave.\"\n\nMr. Magee introduced the Hermit of Baldpate.\n\n\"Pleased to meet you,\" said Bland. \"I guess it was you I heard in the\nkitchen. So you're going to cater to this select few, are you? Believe\nme, you can't get on the job any too soon to suit me.\"\n\nOut of a near-by door stepped the black-garbed figure of Professor\nThaddeus Bolton, and him Mr. Magee included in the presentation\nceremonies. After the hermit had disappeared below, burdened with his\nmarket basket and the supplies Mr. Magee had brought the night before,\nthe three amateurs at the hermit game gathered by the fire in number\nseven, and Mr. Bland spoke feelingly:\n\n\"I don't know where you plucked that cook, but believe me, you get a\nvote of thanks from yours truly. What is he--an advertisement for a hair\nrestorer?\"\n\n\"He's a hermit,\" explained Magee, \"and lives in a shack near the\nmountain-top. Hermits and barbers aren't supposed to mix. He's also an\nauthor, and is writing a book in which he lays all the trouble of the\nages at the feet of woman. Please treat him with the respect all these\ndignified activities demand.\"\n\n\"A writer, you say,\" commented Professor Bolton. \"Let us hope it will\nnot interfere with his cooking abilities. For even I, who am not much\ngiven to thought about material things, must admit the presence of a\ngnawing hunger within.\"\n\nThey talked little, being men unfed, while Jake Peters started\nproceedings in the kitchen, and tramped up-stairs with many pails of\nwater. Mr. Magee requested warm water for shaving; whereupon he was\nregarded with mingled emotions by his companions.\n\n\"You ain't going to see any skirts up here,\" Mr. Bland promised him. And\nMr. Peters, bringing the water from below, took occasion to point out\nthat shaving was one of man's troubles directly attributable to woman's\npresence in the world.\n\nAt length the hermit summoned them to breakfast, and as they descended\nthe broad stair the heavenly odor of coffee sent a glow to their hearts.\nPeters had built a rousing fire in the big fireplace opposite the\nclerk's desk in the office, and in front of this he had placed a table\nwhich held promise of a satisfactory breakfast. As the three sat down,\nMr. Bland spoke:\n\n\"I don't know about you, gentlemen, but I could fall on Mr. Peters' neck\nand call him blessed.\"\n\nThe gentleman thus referred to served them genially. He brought to Mr.\nMagee, between whom and himself he recognized the tie of authorship, a\ncopy of a New York paper that he claimed to get each morning from the\nstation agent, and which helped him greatly, he said, in his eternal\nsearch for the woman. As the meal passed, Mr. Magee glanced it through.\nTwice he looked up from it to study keenly his queer companions at\nBaldpate Inn. Finally he handed it across the table to the haberdasher.\nThe dull yellow sun of a winter morning drifted in from the white\noutdoors; the fire sputtered gaily in the grate. Also, Mr. Peters'\nfailing for literature interfered in no way with his talents as cook.\nThe three finished the repast in great good humor, and Mr. Magee handed\nround cigars.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" he remarked, pushing back his chair, \"we find ourselves in\na peculiar position. Three lone men, knowing nothing of one another, we\nhave sought the solitude of Baldpate Inn at almost the same moment. Why?\nLast night, before you came, Professor Bolton, Mr. Bland gave me as his\nreason for being here the story of Arabella, which I afterward\nappropriated as a joke and gave as my own reason. I related to Mr. Bland\nthe fiction about the artist and the besieging novelists. We swapped\nstories when you came--it was our merry little method of doubting each\nother's word. Perhaps it was bad taste. At any rate, looking at it in\nthe morning light, I am inclined to return Mr. Bland's Arabella, and no\nquestions asked. He is again the lovelorn haberdasher. I am inclined to\nbelieve, implicitly, your story. That is my proposition. No doubts of\none another. We are here for whatever reasons we say we are.\"\n\nThe professor nodded gravely.\n\n\"Last night,\" went on Mr. Magee, \"there was some talk between Mr. Bland\nand myself about one of us leaving the inn. Mr. Bland demanded it. I\ntrust he sees the matter differently this morning. I for one should be\nsorry to see him go.\"\n\n\"I've changed my mind,\" said Mr. Bland. The look on his thin face was\nnot a pleasant one. \"Very good,\" went on Mr. Magee. \"I see no reason why\nwe should not proceed on friendly terms. Mr. Peters has agreed to cook\nfor us. He can no doubt be persuaded to attend to our other wants. For\nhis services we shall pay him generously, in view of the circumstances.\nAs for Quimby--I leave you to make your peace with him.\"\n\n\"I have a letter to Mr. Quimby from my old friend, John Bentley,\" said\nthe professor, \"which I am sure will win me the caretaker's warm\nregard.\"\n\nMr. Magee looked at Bland.\n\n\"I'll get Andy Rutter on the wire,\" said that gentleman. \"Quimby will\nlisten to him, I guess.\"\n\n\"Maybe,\" remarked Magee carelessly. \"Who is Rutter?\"\n\n\"He's manager of the inn when it's open,\" answered Bland. He looked\nsuspiciously at Magee. \"I only know him slightly,\" he added.\n\n\"Those matters you will arrange for yourselves,\" Mr. Magee went on. \"I\nshall be very glad of your company if you can fix it to stay. Believe it\nor not--I forgot, we agreed to believe, didn't we?--I am here to do some\nwriting. I'm going up to my room now to do a little work. All I ask of\nyou gentlemen is that, as a favor to me, you refrain from shooting at\neach other while I am gone. You see, I am trying to keep crude melodrama\nout of my stuff.\"\n\n\"I am sure,\" remarked Professor Bolton, \"that the use of firearms as a\nmeans of social diversion between Mr. Bland and myself is unthought of.\"\n\n\"I hope so,\" responded Magee. \"There, then, the matter rests. We are\nhere--that is all.\" He hesitated, as though in doubt. Then, with a\ndecisive motion, he drew toward him the New York paper. With his eyes on\nthe head-lines of the first page, he continued: \"I shall demand no\nfurther explanations. And except for this once, I shall make no\nreference to this story in the newspaper, to the effect that early\nyesterday morning, in a laboratory at one of our leading universities, a\nyoung assistant instructor was found dead under peculiar circumstances.\"\nHe glanced keenly at the bald-headed little man across from him. \"Nor\nshall I make conversation of the fact,\" he added, \"that the professor of\nchemistry at the university, a man past middle age, respected highly in\nthe university circle, is missing.\"\n\nAn oppressive silence followed this remark. Mr. Bland's sly eyes sought\nquickly the professor's face. The older man sat staring at his plate;\nthen he raised his head and the round spectacles were turned full on\nMagee.\n\n\"You are very kind,\" said Professor Bolton evenly.\n\n\"There is another story in this paper,\" went on Mr. Magee, glancing at\nthe haberdasher, \"that, it seems to me, I ought to taboo as table talk\nat Baldpate Inn. It relates that a few days ago the youthful cashier of\na bank in a small Pennsylvania town disappeared with thirty thousand\ndollars of the bank's funds. No,\" he concluded, \"we are simply here,\ngentlemen, and I am very glad to let it go at that.\"\n\nMr. Bland sneered knowingly.\n\n\"I should think you would be,\" he said. \"If you'll turn that paper over\nyou'll read on the back page that day before yesterday a lot of\nexpensive paintings in a New York millionaire's house were cut from\ntheir frames, and that the young artist who was doing retouching in the\nhouse at the time has been just careless enough not to send his address\nto the police. It's a small matter, of course, and the professor and I\nwill never mention it again.\"\n\nMr. Magee threw back his head and laughed heartily.\n\n\"We understand one another, it seems,\" he said. \"I look forward to\npleasant companionship where I had expected solitude. You will excuse me\nnow--there is the work to which I referred. Ah, here's Peters,\" he added\nas the hermit entered through the dining-room door at the side of the\nstairs.\n\n\"All finished, gentlemen?\" he asked, coming forward. \"Now, this is solid\ncomfort, ain't it? I reckon when you get a few days of this, you'll all\nbecome hermits, and build yourselves shacks on the mountain. Solid\ncomfort. No woman to make you put on overshoes when you go out, or\nlecture you about the effects of alcohol on the stomach. Heaven, I call\nit.\"\n\n\"Peters,\" said Mr. Magee, \"we have been wondering if you will stay on\nhere and cook for us. We need you. How about it?\"\n\n\"Well--I'll be glad to help you out,\" the hermit replied. \"I guess I can\nmanage to give satisfaction, seeing there ain't no women around. If\nthere was, I wouldn't think of it. Yes, I'll stay and do what I can to\nboost the hermit life in your estimation. I--\"\n\nHe stopped. His eyes were on the dining-room door, toward which Mr.\nMagee's back was turned. The jaw of Peters fell, and his mouth stood\nwide open. Behind the underbrush of beard a very surprised face was\ndiscernible.\n\nMr. Magee turned quickly. A few feet inside the door stood the girl of\nthe station, weeping no more, but radiant with smiles. Back of her was\nthe determined impossible companion of yesterday.\n\n\"Oh, mamma,\" laughed the girl, \"we're too late for breakfast! Isn't it a\nshame?\"\n\nMr. Bland's lean hands went quickly to adjust his purple tie. Professor\nBolton looked every inch the owl as he blinked in dazed fashion at the\nblue corduroy vision. Gingerly Mr. Peters set down the plates he had\ntaken from the table, still neglecting his open mouth.\n\nMr. Magee rose from the table, and went forward with outstretched hand.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nTHE MAYOR CASTS A SHADOW BEFORE\n\n\n\"From tears to smiles,\" said Mr. Magee, taking the girl's hand. \"What\nworked the transformation? Not the Commercial House, I know, for I\npassed it last evening.\"\n\n\"No, hardly the Commercial House,\" laughed the girl. \"Rather the\nsunshine of a winter morning, the brisk walk up the mountain, and the\nsight of the Hermit of Baldpate with eyes like saucers staring at a\nlittle girl who once bought his postal cards.\"\n\n\"Then you know Mr. Peters?\" inquired Magee.\n\n\"Is that his name? You see, I never met him in private life--he was just\nthe hermit when I knew him. I used to come to Baldpate in the summers,\nand send his cards back to the folks at home, and dream dreams of his\nlove-story when from my window I saw the light of his shack at night.\nI'm so glad to meet Mr. Peters informally.\"\n\nShe held out her hand, but Peters, by long practise wary of women, had\nburdened himself with breakfast plates which prevented his clasping it.\nHe muttered \"How d'ye do?\" and fled toward the door, narrowly averting\nwhat would have proved a serious collision with the large woman on the\nway.\n\n\"Mr. Peters meets so few of your sex in winter,\" Magee apologized, \"you\nmust pardon his clumsiness. This gentleman\"--he indicated the professor,\nwho arose--\"is Thaddeus Bolton, a distinguished member of a certain\nuniversity faculty, who has fled to Baldpate to escape the press of\nAmerica. And this is Mr. Bland, who hides here from the world the scars\nof a broken heart. But let us not go into details.\"\n\nThe girl smiled brightly. \"And you--\" she asked.\n\n\"William Hallowell Magee,\" he returned, bowing low. \"I have a neat\nlittle collection of stories accounting for my presence here, from which\nI shall allow you to choose later. Not to mention the real one, which is\nsimple almost to a fault.\"\n\n\"I am so happy to meet you all,\" said the girl. \"We shall no doubt\nbecome very good friends. For mamma and I have also come to Baldpate\nInn--to stay.\"\n\nMr. Bland opened wide his usually narrow eyes, and ran his hand\nthoughtfully over his one day's beard. Professor Bolton blinked his\nastonishment. Mr. Magee smiled.\n\n\"I, for one, am delighted to hear it,\" he said.\n\n\"My name,\" went on the girl, \"is Mary Norton. May I present my mother,\nMrs. Norton?\"\n\nThe older woman adopted what was obviously her society manner. Once\nagain Mr. Magee felt a pang of regret that this should be the parent of\na girl so charming.\n\n\"I certainly am pleased to meet you all,\" she said in her heavy voice.\n\"Ain't it a lovely morning after the storm? The sun's almost blinding.\"\n\n\"Some explanation,\" put in Miss Norton quickly, \"is due you if I am to\nthrust myself thus upon you. I am perfectly willing to tell why I am\nhere--but the matter mustn't leak out. I can trust you, I'm sure.\"\n\nMr. Magee drew up chairs, and the two women were seated before the fire.\n\n\"The bandits of Baldpate,\" he remarked flippantly, glancing at the two\nmen, \"have their own code of honor, and the first rule is never to\nbetray a pal.\"\n\n\"Splendid!\" laughed the girl. \"You said, I believe, that Professor\nBolton was fleeing from the newspapers. I am fleeing for the\nnewspapers--to attract their attention--to lure them into giving me that\nthing so necessary to a woman in my profession, publicity. You see, I am\nan actress. The name I gave you is not my stage name. That, perhaps, you\nwould know. I employ a gentleman to keep me before the public as much as\npossible. It's horrid, I know, but it means bread and butter to me. That\ngentleman, my press-agent, evolved the present scheme--a mysterious\ndisappearance.\"\n\nShe paused and looked at the others. Mr. Magee surveyed her narrowly.\nThe youthful bloom of her cheek carried to him no story of grease paint;\nher unaffected manner was far from suggesting anything remotely\nconnected with the stage. He wondered.\n\n\"I am to disappear completely for a time,\" she went on. \"'As though the\nearth had swallowed me' will be the good old phrase of the reporters. I\nam to linger here at Baldpate Inn, a key to which my press-agent has\nsecured for me. Meanwhile, the papers will speak tearfully of me in\ntheir head-lines--at least, I hope they will. Can't you just see\nthem--those head-lines? 'Beautiful Actress Drops from Sight'.\" She\nstopped, blushing. \"Every woman who gets into print, you know, is\nbeautiful.\"\n\n\"But it'd be no lie in your case, dearie,\" put in Mrs. Norton, feeling\ncarefully of her atrociously blond store hair.\n\n\"Your mother takes the words from my mouth,\" smiled Mr. Magee. \"Guard as\nthey will against it, the newspapers let the truth crop out\noccasionally. And this will be such an occasion.\"\n\n\"From what part of Ireland do you come?\" laughed the girl. She seemed\nsomewhat embarrassed by her mother's open admiration. \"Well, setting all\nblarney aside, such will be the head-lines. And when the last clue is\nexhausted, and my press-agent is the same, I come back to appear in a\nnew play, a well-known actress. Of such flippant things is a Broadway\nreputation built.\"\n\n\"We all wish you success, I'm sure.\" Mr. Magee searched his memory in\nvain for this \"actress's\" name and fame. Could it be possible, he\nwondered, at this late day, that any one would try for publicity by such\nan obvious worn-out road? Hardly. The answer was simple. Another fable\nwas being spun from whole cloth beneath the roof of Baldpate Inn. \"We\nhave a New York paper here,\" he went on, \"but as yet there seems to be\nno news of your sad disappearance.\"\n\n\"Wouldn't it be the limit if they didn't fall for it?\" queried the older\nwoman.\n\n\"Fall for it,\" repeated Professor Bolton, not questioningly, but with\nthe air of a scientist about to add a new and rare specimen to his\nalcohol jar.\n\n\"She means, if they didn't accept my disappearance as legitimate news,\"\nexplained the girl \"That would be very disappointing. But surely there\nwas no harm in making the experiment.\"\n\n\"They're a clever lot, those newspaper guys,\" sneered Mr. Bland, \"in\ntheir own opinion. But when you come right down to it, every one of 'em\nhas a nice little collection of gold bricks in his closet. I guess\nyou've got them going. I hope so.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" smiled the girl. \"You are very kind. You are here, I\nunderstand, because of an unfortunate--er--affair of the heart?\"\n\nMr. Bland smoothed back his black oily hair from his forehead, and\nsmirked. \"Oh, now--\" he protested.\n\n\"Arabella,\" put in Mr. Magee, \"was her name. The beauties of history and\nmythology hobbled into oblivion at sight of her.\"\n\n\"I'm quick to forget,\" insisted Mr. Bland.\n\n\"That does you no credit, I'm sure,\" replied the girl severely. \"And\nnow, mamma, I think we had better select our rooms--\"\n\nShe paused. For Elijah Quimby had come in through the dining-room door,\nand stood gazing at the group before the fire, his face reflecting what\nMr. Magee, the novelist, would not have hesitated a moment in terming\n\"mingled emotions\".\n\n\"Well,\" drawled Mr. Quimby. He strode into the room. \"Mr. Magee,\" he\nsaid, \"that letter from Mr. Bentley asked me to let you stay at Baldpate\nInn. There wasn't anything in it about your bringing parties of friends\nalong.\"\n\n\"These are not friends I've brought along,\" explained Magee. \"They're\nsimply some more amateur hermits who have strolled in from time to time.\nAll have their individual latch-keys to the hermitage. And all, I\nbelieve, have credentials for you to examine.\"\n\nMr. Quimby stared in angry wonder.\n\n\"Is the world crazy?\" he demanded. \"Any one 'd think it was July, the\nway people act. The inn's closed, I tell you. It ain't running.\"\n\nProfessor Bolton rose from his chair.\n\n\"So you are Quimby,\" he said in a soothing tone. \"I'm glad to meet you\nat last. My old friend John Bentley has spoken of you so often. I have a\nletter from him.\" He drew the caretaker to one side, and took an\nenvelope from his pocket. The two conversed in low tones.\n\nQuickly the girl in the corduroy suit leaned toward Mr. Magee. She\nwhispered, and her tone was troubled:\n\n\"Stand by me. I'm afraid I'll need your help.\"\n\n\"What's the matter?\" inquired Magee.\n\n\"I haven't much of any right here, I guess. But I had to come.\"\n\n\"But your key?\"\n\n\"I fear my--my press-agent--stole it.\"\n\nA scornful remark as to the antiquated methods of that mythical\npublicity promoter rose to Mr. Magee's lips, but before he spoke he\nlooked into her eyes. And the remark was never made. For in their\nwonderful depths he saw worry and fear and unhappiness, as he had seen\nthem there amid tears in the station.\n\n\"Never mind,\" he said very gently, \"I'll see you through.\"\n\nQuimby was standing over Mr. Bland. \"How about you?\" he asked.\n\n\"Call up Andy Rutter and ask about me,\" replied Bland, in the tone of\none who prefers war to peace.\n\n\"I work for Mr. Bentley,\" said Quimby. \"Rutter hasn't any authority\nhere. He isn't to be manager next season, I understand. However the\nprofessor wants me to let you stay. He says he'll be responsible.\" Mr.\nBland looked in open-mouthed astonishment at the unexpected sponsor he\nhad found. \"And you?\" went on Quimby to the women.\n\n\"Why--\" began Miss Norton.\n\n\"Absolutely all right,\" said Mr. Magee. \"They come from Hal Bentley,\nlike myself. He's put them in my care. I'll answer for them.\" He saw the\ngirl's eyes; they spoke her thanks.\n\nMr. Quimby shook his head as one in a dream.\n\n\"All this is beyond me--way beyond,\" he ruminated. \"Nothing like it ever\nhappened before that I've heard of. I'm going to write all about it to\nMr. Bentley, and I suppose I got to let you stay till I hear from him. I\nthink he ought to come up here, if he can.\"\n\n\"The more the merrier,\" said Mr. Magee, reflecting cheerfully that the\nBentleys were in Florida at last accounts.\n\n\"Come, mamma,\" said Miss Norton, rising, \"let's go up and pick out a\nsuite. There's one I used to have a few years ago--you can see the\nhermit's shack from the windows. By the way, Mr. Magee, will you send\nMr. Peters up to us? He may be able to help us get settled.\"\n\n\"Ahem,\" muttered Mr. Magee, \"I--I'll have a talk with Peters. To be\nquite frank, I anticipate trouble. You see, the Hermit of Baldpate\ndoesn't approve of women--\"\n\n\"Don't approve of women,\" cried Mrs. Norton, her green eyes flashing.\n\"Why not, I'd like to know?\"\n\n\"My dear madam,\" responded Mr. Magee, \"only echo answers, and it but\nvacuously repeats, 'Why not?'. That, however, is the situation. Mr.\nPeters loathes the sex. I imagine that, until to-day, he was not\nparticularly happy in the examples of it he encountered. Why, he has\neven gone so far as to undertake a book attributing all the trouble of\nthe world to woman.\"\n\n\"The idiot!\" cried Mrs. Norton.\n\n\"Delicious!\" laughed the girl.\n\n\"I shall ask Peters to serve you,\" said Magee. \"I shall appeal to his\ngallant side. But I must proceed gently. This is his first day as our\ncook, and you know how necessary a good first impression is with a new\ncook. I'll appeal to his better nature.\"\n\n\"Don't do it,\" cried the girl. \"Don't emphasize us to him in any way, or\nhe may exercise his right as cook and leave. Just ignore us. We'll play\nat being our own bell-boys.\"\n\n\"Ignore you,\" cried Mr. Magee. \"What Herculean tasks you set. I'm not\nequal to that one.\" He picked up their traveling-bags and led the way\nup-stairs. \"I'm something of a bell-boy myself, when roused,\" he said.\n\nThe girl selected suite seventeen, at the farther end of the corridor\nfrom Magee's apartments. \"It's the very one I used to have, years and\nyears ago--at least two or three years ago,\" she said. \"Isn't it stupid?\nAll the furniture in a heap.\"\n\n\"And cold,\" said Mrs. Norton. \"My land, I wish I was back by my own\nfire.\"\n\n\"I'll make you regret your words, Mrs. Norton,\" cried Magee. He threw up\nthe windows, pulled off his coat, and set to work on the furniture. The\ngirl bustled about, lightening his work by her smile. Mrs. Norton\nmanaged to get consistently in the way. When he had the furniture\ndistributed, he procured logs and tried his hand at a fire. Then he\nstood, his black hair disheveled, his hands soiled, but his heart very\ngay, before the girl of the station.\n\n\"I hope you don't expect a tip,\" she said, laughing.\n\n\"I do,\" he said, coming closer, and speaking in a voice that was not for\nthe ear of the chaperon. \"I want a tip on this--do you really act?\"\n\nShe looked at him steadily.\n\n\"Once,\" she said, \"when I was sixteen, I appeared in an amateur play at\nschool. It was my first and last appearance on the stage.\"\n\n\"Thanks, lady,\" remarked Mr. Magee in imitation of the bell-boy he was\nsupposed to be. He sought number seven. There he made himself again\npresentable, after which he descended to the office.\n\nMr. Bland sat reading the New York paper before the fire. From the\nlittle card-room and the parlor, the two rooms to the right and left of\nthe hotel's front door, Quimby had brought forth extra chairs. He stood\nnow by the large chair that held Professor Bolton, engaged in\nconversation with that gentleman.\n\n\"Yes,\" he was saying, \"I lived three years in Reuton and five years in\nNew York. It took me eight years--eight years to realize the truth.\"\n\n\"I heard about it from John Bentley,\" the professor said gently.\n\n\"He's been pretty kind to me, Mr. Bentley has,\" replied Quimby. \"When\nthe money was all gone, he offered me this job. Once the Quimbys owned\nmost of the land around Baldpate Mountain. It all went in those eight\nyears. To think that it took all those years for me to find it out.\"\n\n\"If I'm not impertinent, Quimby,\" put in Magee, \"to find what out?\"\n\n\"That what I wanted, the railroad men didn't want,\" replied Quimby\nbitterly, \"and that was--the safety of the public. You see, I invented a\nnew rail joint, one that was a great improvement on the old kind. I had\nsort of an idea, when I was doing it--an idea of service to the\nworld--you know. God, what a joke! I sold all the Quimby lands, and went\nto Reuton, and then to New York, to place it. Not one of the railroad\nmen but admitted that it was an improvement, and a big one--and not one\nbut fought like mad to keep me from getting it down where the public\nwould see it. They didn't want the expense of a change.\"\n\nMr. Quimby looked out at the sunlit stretch of snow.\n\n\"Eight years,\" he repeated, \"I fought and pleaded. No, I begged--that\nwas the word--I begged. You'd be surprised to know the names of some of\nthe men who kept me waiting in their private offices, and sneered at me\nover their polished desks. They turned me down--every one. Some of them\nplayed me--as though I'd been a fish. They referred me to other ends of\nthe same big game, laughing in their sleeves, I guess, at the knowledge\nof how hopeless it was. Oh, they made a fine fool of me.\"\n\n\"You might have put down some of your joints at your own expense,\"\nsuggested the professor.\n\n\"Didn't I try?\" cried Quimby. \"Do you think they'd let me? No, the\npublic might see them and demand them everywhere. Once, I thought I had\nconvinced somebody. It was down in Reuton--the Suburban Railway.\" There\nwas a rustle as Mr. Bland let his paper fall to the floor. \"Old Henry\nThornhill was president of the road--he is yet, I guess--but young\nHayden and a fellow named David Kendrick were running it. Kendrick was\non my side--he almost had Hayden. They were going to let me lay a\nstretch of track with my joints. Then--something happened. Maybe you\nremember. Kendrick disappeared in the night--he's never been seen\nsince.\"\n\n\"I do remember,\" said the professor softly.\n\n\"Hayden turned me down,\" went on Quimby. \"The money was all gone. So I\ncame back to Upper Asquewan--caretaker of an inn that overlooks the\nproperty my father owned--the property I squandered for a chance to save\nhuman lives. It's all like a dream now--those eight years. And it nearly\ndrives me mad, sometimes, to think that it took me eight years--eight\nyears to find it out. I'll just straighten things around a bit.\"\n\nHe moved away, and the men sat in silence for a time. Then the professor\nspoke very gently:\n\n\"Poor devil--to have had his dream of service--and then grow old on\nBaldpate.\"\n\nThe two joined Mr. Bland by the fire. Mr. Magee had put from his mind\nall intention of work. The maze of events through which he wandered held\nhim bewildered and enthralled. He looked at the haberdasher and the\nuniversity scholar and asked himself if they were real, or if he was\nstill asleep in a room on a side street in New York, waiting for the\ncheery coming of Geoffrey. He asked himself still more perplexedly if\nthe creature that came toward him now through the dining-room door was\nreal--the hairy Hermit of Baldpate, like a figure out of some old print,\nhis market basket on his arm again, his coat buttoned to the chin.\n\n\"Well, everything's shipshape in the kitchen,\" announced the hermit\ncheerfully. \"I couldn't go without seeing to that. I wish you the best\nof luck, gentlemen--and good-by.\"\n\n\"Good-by?\" cried the professor.\n\n\"By the gods, he's leaving us,\" almost wept Mr. Bland.\n\n\"It can't be,\" said Mr. Magee.\n\n\"It has to be,\" said the Hermit of Baldpate, solemnly shaking his head.\n\"I'd like to stay with you, and I would of, if they hadn't come. But\nhere they are--and when women come in the door, I fly out of the window,\nas the saying is.\"\n\n\"But, Peters,\" pleaded Magee, \"you're not going to leave us in the hole\nlike this?\"\n\n\"Sorry,\" replied Peters, \"I can please men, but I can't please women. I\ntried to please one once--but let the dead past bury its dead. I live on\nBaldpate in a shack to escape the sex, and it wouldn't be consistent for\nme to stay here now. I got to go. I hate to, like a dog, but I got to.\"\n\n\"Peters,\" said Mr. Magee, \"I'm surprised. After giving your word to\nstay! And who knows--you may be able to gather valuable data for your\nbook. Stick around. These women won't bother you. I'll make them promise\nnever to ask about the love-affair you didn't have--never even to come\nnear you. And we'll pay you beyond the dreams of avarice of a Broadway\nchef. Won't we, gentlemen?\"\n\nThe others nodded. Mr. Peters visibly weakened.\n\n\"Well--\" he began. \"I--\" His eyes were on the stair. Mr. Magee also\nlooked in that direction and saw the girl of the station smiling down.\nShe no longer wore coat and hat, and the absence of the latter revealed\na glory of golden hair that became instantly a rival to the sunshine in\nthat drear bare room.\n\n\"No, Peters,\" she said, \"you mustn't go. We couldn't permit it. Mamma\nand I will go.\"\n\nShe continued to smile at the obviously dazzled Peters. Suddenly he\nspoke in a determined tone:\n\n\"No--don't do that. I'll stay.\" Then he turned to Magee, and continued\nfor that gentleman's ear alone: \"Dog-gone it, we're all alike. We\nresolve and resolve, and then one of them looks at us, and it's all\nforgot. I had a friend who advertised for a wife, leastways, he was a\nfriend until he advertised. He got ninety-two replies, seventy of 'em\nfrom married men advising against the step. 'I'm cured,' he says to me.\n'Not for me.' Did he keep his word? No. A week after he married a widow\njust to see if what the seventy said was true. I'm mortal. I hang around\nthe buzz-saw. If you give me a little money, I'll go down to the village\nand buy the provisions for lunch.\"\n\nGleefully Mr. Magee started the hermit on his way, and then went over to\nwhere the girl stood at the foot of the stairs.\n\n\"I promised him,\" he told her, \"you'd ask no questions regarding his\nbroken heart. It seems he hasn't any.\"\n\n\"That's horrid of him, isn't it?\" she smiled. \"Every good hermit is\nequipped with a broken heart. I certainly shan't bother him. I came down\nto get some water.\"\n\nThey went together to the kitchen, found a pail, and filled it with icy\nwater from the pump at the rear of the inn. Inside once more, Mr. Magee\nremarked thoughtfully:\n\n\"Who would have guessed a week ago that to-day I would be climbing the\nbroad staircase of a summer hotel carrying a pail of water for a lady\nfair?\"\n\nThey paused on the landing.\n\n\"There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,\" smiled the girl,\n\"than are dreamed of, even by novelists.\" Mr. Magee started. Had she\nrecognized him as the Magee of light fiction? It seemed hardly likely;\nthey read his books, but they rarely remembered his name. Her face went\nsuddenly grave. She came closer. \"I can't help wondering,\" she said,\n\"which side you are on?\"\n\n\"Which side of what?\" asked Magee.\n\n\"Why, of this,\" she answered, waving her hand toward the office below.\n\n\"I don't understand,\" objected Mr. Magee.\n\n\"Let's not be silly,\" she replied. \"You know what brought me here. I\nknow what brought you. There are three sides, and only one is honest. I\nhope, so very much, that you are on that side.\"\n\n\"Upon my word--\" began Magee.\n\n\"Will it interest you to know,\" she continued, \"I saw the big mayor of\nReuton in the village this morning? With him was his shadow, Lou Max.\nLet's see--you had the first key, Mr. Bland the second, the professor\nthe third, and I had the fourth. The mayor has the fifth key, of course.\nHe'll be here soon.\"\n\n\"The mayor,\" gasped Mr. Magee. \"Really, I haven't the slightest idea\nwhat you mean. I'm here to work--\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said the girl coldly, \"if you wish it that way.\" They came\nto the door of seventeen, and she took the pail from Mr. Magee's hand.\n\"Thanks.\"\n\n\"'Where are you going, my pretty maid?'\" asked Magee, indicating the\npail.\n\n\"'\"I'll see you at luncheon, sir,\" she said,'\" responded Miss Norton,\nand the door of seventeen slammed shut.\n\nMr. Magee returned to number seven, and thoughtfully stirred the fire.\nThe tangle of events bade fair to swamp him.\n\n\"The mayor of Reuton,\" he mused, \"has the fifth key. What in the name of\ncommon sense is going on? It's too much even for melodramatic me.\" He\nleaned back in his chair. \"Anyhow, I like her eyes,\" he said. \"And I\nshouldn't want to be quoted as disapproving of her hair, either. I'm on\nher side, whichever it may be.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nGHOSTS OF THE SUMMER CROWD\n\n\n\"I wonder,\" Miss Norton smiled up into Mr. Magee's face, \"if you ever\nwatched the people at a summer hotel get set on their mark for the\nsprint through the dining-room door?\"\n\n\"No,\" answered Magee, \"but I have visited the Zoo at meal-time. They\ntell me it is much the same.\"\n\n\"A brutal comparison,\" said the girl. \"But just the same I'm sure that\nthe head waiter who opens the door here at Baldpate must feel much the\nsame at the moment as the keeper who proffers the raw meat on the end of\nthe pitchfork. He faces such a wild determined mob. The front rank is\nmade up of hard-faced women worn out by veranda gossip. Usually some\nstiff old dowager crosses the tape first. I was thinking that perhaps we\nresembled that crowd in the eyes of Mr. Peters now.\"\n\nIt was past one o'clock, and Mr. Magee with his four mysterious\ncompanions stood before the fire in the office, each with an eager eye\nout for the progress of the hermit, who was preparing the table beside\nthem. Through the kindness of Quimby, the board was resplendent with\nsnowy linen.\n\n\"We may seem over-eager,\" commented Professor Bolton. \"I have no doubt\nwe do. It is only natural. With nothing to look forward to but the next\nmeal, the human animal attaches a preposterous importance to his\nfeeding. We are in the same case as the summer guests--\"\n\n\"Are we?\" interrupted Mr. Magee. \"Have we nothing but the next meal to\nlook forward to? I think not. I haven't. I've come to value too highly\nthe capacity for excitement of Baldpate Inn in December. I look forward\nto startling things. I expect, before the day is out, at least two\ngold-laced kings, an exiled poet, and a lord mayor, all armed with keys\nto Baldpate Inn and stories strange and unconvincing.\"\n\n\"Your adventures of the last twenty-four hours,\" remarked the professor,\nsmiling wanly, \"have led you to expect too much. I have made inquiries\nof Quimby. There are, aside from his own, but seven keys in all to the\nvarious doors of Baldpate Inn. Four are here represented. It is hardly\nlikely that the other three will send delegates, and if they should, you\nhave but a slim chance for kings and poets. Even Baldpate's capacity for\nexcitement, you see, is limited by the number of little steel keys which\nopen its portals to exiles from the outside world. I am reminded of the\nwords of the philosopher--\"\n\n\"Well, Peters, old top,\" broke in Mr. Bland in robust tones, \"isn't she\nnearly off the fire?\"\n\n\"Now see here,\" said the hermit, setting down the armful of dishes with\nwhich he had entered the office, \"I can't be hurried. I'm all upset, as\nit is. I can't cook to please women--I don't pretend to. I have to take\nall sorts of precautions with this lunch. Without meaning to be\nimpolite, but just because of a passion for cold facts, I may say that\nwomen are faultfinding.\"\n\n\"I'm sure,\" said Miss Norton sweetly, \"that I shall consider your\nluncheon perfect.\"\n\n\"They get more faultfinding as they get older,\" replied Mr. Peters\nungallantly, glancing at the other woman.\n\nMrs. Norton glared.\n\n\"Meaning me, I suppose,\" she rasped. \"Well, don't worry. I ain't going\nto find anything wrong.\"\n\n\"I ain't asking the impossible,\" responded Mr. Peters. \"I ain't asking\nyou not to find anything wrong. I'm just asking you not to mention it\nwhen you do.\" He retired to the kitchen.\n\nMrs. Norton caressed her puffs lovingly.\n\n\"What that man needs,\" she said, \"is a woman's guiding hand. He's lived\nalone too long. I'd like to have charge of him for a while. Not that I\nwouldn't be kind--but I'd be firm. If poor Norton was alive to-day he'd\ntestify that I was always kindness itself. But I insisted on his living\nup to his promises. When I was a girl I was mighty popular. I had a lot\nof admirers.\"\n\n\"No one could possibly doubt that,\" Mr. Magee assured her.\n\n\"Then Norton came along,\" she went on, rewarding Magee with a smile,\n\"and said he wanted to make me happy. So I thought I'd let him try. He\nwas a splendid man, but there's no denying that in the years we were\nmarried he sometimes forgot what he started out to do. I always brought\nhim up sharp. 'Your great desire,' I told him, 'is to make me happy. I'd\nkeep on the job if I was you!' And he did, to the day of his death. A\nperfectly lovely man, though careless in money matters. If he hadn't had\nthat failing I wouldn't be--\"\n\nMiss Norton, her cheeks flushed, broke in hurriedly.\n\n\"Mamma, these gentlemen can't be at all interested.\" Deftly she turned\nthe conversation to generalities.\n\nMr. Peters at last seated the winter guests of Baldpate Inn, and opened\nhis luncheon with a soup which he claimed to have wrested from a can.\nThis news drew from Professor Bolton a learned discourse on the tinned\naids to the hermit of to-day. He pictured the seeker for solitude\nsetting out for a desert isle, with canned foods for his body and canned\nmusic for his soul. \"Robinson Crusoe,\" he said, \"should be rewritten\nwith a can-opener in the leading r\u00c3\u00b4le.\" Mrs. Norton gave the talk a more\npractical turn by bringing up the topic of ptomaine poisoning.\n\nWhile the conversation drifted on, Mr. Magee pondered in silence the\nweird mesh in which he had become involved. What did it all mean? What\nbrought these people to Baldpate Christmas week? His eyes sought the\ngreat safe back of the desk, and stayed there a long time. In that safe,\nhe was sure, lay the answer to this preposterous riddle. When his\nthoughts came back to the table he found Mr. Bland eying him narrowly.\nThere was a troubled look on the haberdasher's lean face that could\nnever be ascribed to the cruelty of Arabella.\n\nThe luncheon over, Miss Norton and her mother prepared to ascend to\ntheir rooms. Mr. Magee maneuvered so as to meet the girl at the foot of\nthe stairs.\n\n\"Won't you come back,\" he whispered softly, \"and explain things to a\npoor hermit who is completely at sea?\"\n\n\"What things?\" she asked.\n\n\"What it all means,\" he whispered. \"Why you wept in the station, why you\ninvented the story of the actress, why you came here to brighten my drab\nexile--what this whole comedy of Baldpate Inn amounts to, anyhow? I\nassure you I am as innocent of understanding it as is the czar of Russia\non his golden throne.\"\n\nShe only looked at him with unbelieving eyes.\n\n\"You can hardly expect me to credit that,\" she said. \"I must go up now\nand read mamma into the pleasant land of thin girlish figures that is\nher afternoon siesta. I may come back and talk to you after a while, but\nI don't promise to explain.\"\n\n\"Come back,\" pleaded Mr. Magee. \"That is all I ask.\"\n\n\"A tiny boon,\" she smiled. \"I grant it.\"\n\nShe followed the generous figure of the other woman up the stair and,\ncasting back a dazzling smile from the landing, disappeared. Mr. Magee\nturned to find Professor Bolton discoursing to Mr. Bland on some aspects\nof the Pagan Renaissance. Mr. Bland's face was pained.\n\n\"That's great stuff, Professor,\" he said, \"and usually I'd like it. But\njust now--I don't seem in the mood, somehow. Would you mind saving it\nfor me till later?\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" sighed the professor. Mr. Bland slouched into the depths of\nhis chair. Professor Bolton turned his disappointed face ceilingward.\nLaughing, Mr. Magee sought the solitude of number seven.\n\n\"After all, I'm here to work,\" he told himself. \"Alarms and excursions\nand blue eyes must not turn me from my task. Let's see--what was my\ntask? A deep heart-searching novel, a novel devoid of rabid melodrama.\nIt becomes more difficult every minute here at Baldpate Inn. But that\nshould only add more zest to the struggle. I devote the next two hours\nto thought.\"\n\nHe pulled his chair up before the blazing hearth, and gazed into the red\ndepths. But his thoughts refused to turn to the masterpiece that was to\nbe born on Baldpate. They roamed to far-off Broadway; they strolled with\nHelen Faulkner--the girl he meant to marry if he ever got round to\nit--along dignified Fifth Avenue. Then joyously they trooped to a far\nmore alluring, more human girl, who pressed a bit of cambric to her face\nin a railway station, while a ginger-haired agent peeped through the\nbars. How ridiculously small that bit of cambric had been to hide so\nmuch beauty. Soon Mr. Magee's thoughts were climbing Baldpate Mountain,\nthere to wander in a mystic maze of ghostly figures which appeared from\nthe shadows, holding aloft in triumph gigantic keys. Mr. Magee had slept\nbut little the night before. The quick December dusk filled number seven\nwhen he awoke with a start.\n\nHe remembered that he had asked the girl to come back to the office, and\nberated himself to think that probably she had done so only to find that\nhe was not there. Hastily straightening his tie, and dashing the traces\nof sleep from his eyes with the aid of cold water, he ran down-stairs.\n\nThe great bare room was in darkness save for the faint red of the fire.\nBefore the fireplace sat the girl of the station, her hair gleaming with\na new splendor in that light. She looked in mock reproval at Mr. Magee.\n\n\"For shame,\" she said, \"to be late at the trysting-place.\"\n\n\"A thousand pardons,\" Mr. Magee replied. \"I fell asleep and dreamed of a\ngirl who wept in a railway station--and she was so altogether charming I\ncould not tear myself away.\"\n\n\"I fear,\" she laughed, \"you are old in the ways of the world. A passion\nfor sleep seems to have seized the hermits. The professor has gone to\nhis room for that purpose. And Mr. Bland, his broken heart forgot,\nslumbers over there.\" She pointed to the haberdasher inert in a big\nchair drawn up near the clerk's desk. \"Only you and I in all the world\nawake.\"\n\n\"Pretty lonesome, isn't it?\" Mr. Magee glanced over his shoulder at the\nshadows that crept in on them.\n\n\"I was finding it very busy when you came,\" she answered. \"You see, I\nhave known the inn when it was gay with summer people, and as I sat here\nby the fire I pretended I saw the ghosts of a lot of the people I knew\nflitting about in the dusk. The rocking-chair fleet sailed by--\"\n\n\"The what?\"\n\n\"Black flag flying, decks cleared for action--I saw the rocking-chair\nfleet go by.\" She smiled faintly. \"We always called them that. Bitter,\nunkind old women who sat hour after hour on the veranda, and rocked and\ngossiped, and gossiped and rocked. All the old women in the world seem\nto gather at summer hotels. And, oh, the cruel mouths the fleet\nhad--just thin lines of mouths--I used to look at them and wonder if any\none had ever kissed them.\"\n\nThe girl's eyes were very large and tender in the firelight.\n\n\"And I saw some poor little ghosts weeping in a corner,\" she went on; \"a\nfew that the fleet had run down and sunk in the sea of gossip. A little\nghost whose mother had not been all she should have been, and the fleet\nfound it out, and rocked, and whispered, and she went away. And a few\nwho were poor--the most terrible of sins--to them the fleet showed no\nmercy. And a fine proud girl, Myra Thornhill, who was engaged to a man\nnamed Kendrick, and who never dared come here again after Kendrick\nsuddenly disappeared, because of the whispered dishonors the fleet\nheaped upon his head.\"\n\n\"What wicked women!\" said Magee.\n\n\"The wickedest women in the world,\" answered the girl. \"But every summer\nresort must have its fleet. I doubt if any other ever had its admiral,\nthough--and that makes Baldpate supreme.\"\n\n\"Its admiral?\"\n\n\"Yes. He isn't really that, I imagine--sort of a vice, or an assistant,\nor whatever it is, long ago retired from the navy. Every summer he comes\nhere, and the place revolves about him. It's all so funny. I wonder if\nany other crowd attains such heights of snobbishness as that at a summer\nresort? It's the admiral this, and the admiral that, from the moment he\nenters the door. Nearly every day the manager of Baldpate has a new\npicture of the admiral taken, and hangs it here in the hotel. I'll show\nthem to you when it's light. There's one over there by the desk, of the\nadmiral and the manager together, and the manager has thrown his arm\ncarelessly over the admiral's shoulder with 'See how well I know him'\nwritten all over his stupid face. Oh, what snobs they are!\"\n\n\"And the fleet?\" asked Mr. Magee.\n\n\"Worships him. They fish all day for a smile from him. They keep track\nof his goings and comings, and when he is in the card-room playing his\nsilly old game of solitaire, they run down their victims in subdued\ntones so as not to disturb him.\"\n\n\"What an interesting place,\" said Mr. Magee. \"I must visit Baldpate next\nsummer. Shall--shall you be here?\"\n\n\"It's so amusing,\" she smiled, ignoring the question. \"You'll enjoy it.\nAnd it isn't all fleet and admiral. There's happiness, and romance, and\nwhispering on the stairs. At night, when the lights are all blazing, and\nthe band is playing waltzes in the casino, and somebody is giving a\ndinner in the grill-room, and the girls flit about in the shadows\nlooking too sweet for words--well, Baldpate Inn is a rather entrancing\nspot. I remember those nights very often now.\"\n\nMr. Magee leaned closer. The flicker of the firelight on her delicate\nface, he decided, was an excellent effect.\n\n\"I can well believe you do remember them,\" he said. \"And it's no effort\nat all to me to picture you as one of those who flitted through the\nshadows--too sweet for words. I can see you the heroine of whispering\nscenes on the stair. I can see you walking with a dazzled happy man on\nthe mountain in the moonlight. Many men have loved you.\"\n\n\"Are you reading my palm?\" she asked, laughing.\n\n\"No--your face,\" answered Mr. Magee. \"Many men have loved you, for very\nfew men are blind. I am sorry I was not the man on the stair, or on the\nmountain in the moonlight. Who knows--I might have been the favored one\nfor my single summer of joy.\"\n\n\"The autumn always came,\" smiled the girl.\n\n\"It would never have come for me,\" he answered. \"Won't you believe me\nwhen I say that I have no part in this strange drama that is going on at\nBaldpate? Won't you credit it when I say that I have no idea why you and\nthe professor and Mr. Bland are here--nor why the Mayor of Reuton has\nthe fifth key? Won't you tell me what it all means?\"\n\n\"I mustn't,\" she replied, shaking her head. \"I can trust no one--not\neven you. I mustn't believe that you don't know--it's preposterous. I\nmust say over and over--even he is simply--will you pardon me--flirting,\ntrying to learn what he can learn. I must.\"\n\n\"You can't even tell me why you wept in the station?\"\n\n\"For a simple silly reason. I was afraid. I had taken up a task too big\nfor me by far--taken it up bravely when I was out in the sunlight of\nReuton. But when I saw Upper Asquewan Falls, and the dark came, and that\ndingy station swallowed me up, something gave way inside me and I felt I\nwas going to fail. So--I cried. A woman's way.\"\n\n\"If I were only permitted to help--\" Mr. Magee pleaded.\n\n\"No--I must go forward alone. I can trust no one, now. Perhaps things\nwill change. I hope they will.\"\n\n\"Listen,\" said Mr. Magee. \"I am telling you the truth. Perhaps you read\na novel called _The Lost Limousine_.\" He was resolved to claim its\nauthorship, tell her of his real purpose in coming to Baldpate, and urge\nher to confide in him regarding the odd happenings at the inn.\n\n\"Yes,\" said the girl before he could continue. \"I did read it. And it\nhurt me. It was so terribly insincere. The man had talent who wrote it,\nbut he seemed to say: 'It's all a great big joke. I don't believe in\nthese people myself. I've just created them to make them dance for you.\nDon't be fooled--it's only a novel.' I don't like that sort of thing. I\nwant a writer really to mean all he says from the bottom of his heart.\"\n\nMr. Magee bit his lip. His determination to claim the authorship of _The\nLost Limousine_ was quite gone.\n\n\"I want him to make me feel with his people,\" the girl went on\nseriously. \"Perhaps I can explain by telling you of something that\nhappened to me once. It was while I was at college. There was a blind\ngirl in my class and one night I went to call on her. I met her in the\ncorridor of her dormitory. Somebody had just brought her back from an\nevening lecture, and left her there. She unlocked her door, and we went\nin. It was pitch dark in the room--the first thing I thought of was a\nlight. But she--she just sat down and began to talk. She had forgot to\nlight the gas.\"\n\nThe girl paused, her eyes very wide, and it seemed to Mr. Magee that she\nshivered slightly.\n\n\"Can you imagine it?\" she asked. \"She chatted on--quite cheerfully as I\nremember it. And I--I stumbled round and fell into a chair, cold and\ntrembly and sick with the awful horror of blindness, for the first time\nin my life. I thought I had imagined before what it was to be\nblind--just by shutting my eyes for a second. But as I sat there in the\nblackness, and listened to that girl chatter, and realized that it had\nnever occurred to her to light a lamp--then for the first time--I\nknew--I knew.\"\n\nAgain she stopped, and Mr. Magee, looking at her, felt what he had never\nexperienced before--a thrill at a woman's near presence.\n\n\"That's what I ask of a writer,\" she said, \"that he make me feel for his\npeople as I felt for that girl that night. Am I asking too much? It need\nnot be for one who is enmeshed in tragedy--it may be for one whose heart\nis as glad as a May morning. But he must make me feel. And he can't do\nthat if he doesn't feel himself, can he?\"\n\nWilliam Hallowell Magee actually hung his head.\n\n\"He can't,\" he confessed softly. \"You're quite right. I like you\nimmensely--more than I can say. And even if you feel you can't trust me,\nI want you to know that I'm on your side in whatever happens at Baldpate\nInn. You have only to ask, and I am your ally.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" she answered. \"I may be very glad to ask. I shall\nremember.\" She rose and moved toward the stairs. \"We had better disperse\nnow. The rocking-chair fleet will get us if we don't watch out.\" Her\nsmall slipper was on the first step of the stair, when they heard a door\nslammed shut, and the sound of steps on the bare floor of the\ndining-room. Then a husky voice called \"Bland\".\n\nMr. Magee felt his hand grasped by a much smaller one, and before he\nknew it he had been hurried to the shadows of the landing. \"The fifth\nkey,\" whispered a scared little voice in his ear. And then he felt the\nfaint brushing of finger-tips across his lips. A mad desire seized him\nto grasp those fingers and hold them on the lips they had scarcely\ntouched. But the impulse was lost in the thrill of seeing the\ndining-room door thrown open and a great bulk of a man cross the floor\nof the office and stand beside Bland's chair. At his side was a thin\nwaif who had not unjustly been termed the mayor of Reuton's shadow.\n\n\"Asleep,\" bellowed the big man. \"How's this for a watch-dog, Lou?\"\n\n\"Right on the job, ain't he?\" sneered the thin one.\n\nMr. Bland started suddenly from slumber, and looked up into the eyes of\nthe newcomers.\n\n\"Hello, Cargan,\" he said. \"Hello, Lou. For the love of heaven, don't\nshout so. The place is full of them.\"\n\n\"Full of what?\" asked the mayor.\n\n\"Of spotters, maybe--I don't know what they are. There's an old\nhigh-brow and a fresh young guy, and two women.\"\n\n\"People,\" gasped the mayor. \"People--here?\"\n\n\"Sure.\"\n\n\"You're asleep, Bland.\"\n\n\"No I'm not, Cargan,\" cried the haberdasher. \"Look around for yourself.\nThe inn's overrun with them.\"\n\nCargan leaned weakly against a chair.\n\n\"Well, what do you know about that,\" he said. \"And they kept telling me\nBaldpate Inn was the best place--say, this is one on Andy Rutter. Why\ndidn't you get it out and beat it?\"\n\n\"How could I?\" Mr. Bland asked. \"I haven't got the combination. The safe\nwas left open for me. That was the agreement with Rutter.\"\n\n\"You might have phoned us not to come,\" remarked Lou, with an uneasy\nglance around.\n\nMr. Cargan hit the mantelpiece with his huge fist.\n\n\"By heaven, no,\" he cried. \"I'll lift it from under their very noses.\nI've done it before--I can do it now. I don't care who they are. They\ncan't touch me. They can't touch Jim Cargan. I ain't afraid.\"\n\nMr. Magee, on the landing, whispered into his companion's ear. \"I think\nI'll go down and greet our guests.\" He felt her grasp his arm suddenly,\nas though in fear, but he shook off her hand and debonairly descended to\nthe group below.\n\n\"Good evening, gentlemen,\" he said suavely. \"Welcome to Baldpate! Please\ndon't attempt to explain--we're fed up on explanations now. You have the\nfifth key, of course. Welcome to our small but growing circle.\"\n\nThe big man advanced threateningly. Mr. Magee saw that his face was very\nred, his neck very thick, but his mouth a cute little cupid's bow that\nmight well have adorned a dainty baby in the park.\n\n\"Who are you?\" bellowed the mayor of Reuton in a tone meant to be\ncowering.\n\n\"I forget,\" replied Mr. Magee easily. \"Bland, who am I to-day? The\ncast-off lover of Arabella, the fleeing artist, or the thief of\nportraits from a New York millionaire's home? Really, it doesn't matter.\nWe shift our stories from time to time. As the first of the Baldpate\nhermits, however, it is my duty to welcome you, which I hereby do.\"\n\nThe mayor pointed dramatically to the stair.\n\n\"I give you fifteen minutes,\" he roared, \"to pack up and get out. I\ndon't want you here. Understand?\"\n\nTo Cargan's side came the slinking figure of Lou Max. His face was the\nwithered yellow of an old lemon; his garb suggested shop-windows on\ndirty side streets; unpleasant eyes shifted behind a pair of gold-rimmed\nglasses. His attitude was that of the dog who crouches by its master.\n\n\"Clear out,\" he snarled.\n\n\"By no means,\" replied Magee, looking the mayor squarely in the eye. \"I\nwas here first. I'm here to stay. Put me out, will you? Well, perhaps,\nafter a fight. But I'd be back in an hour, and with me whatever police\nUpper Asquewan Falls owns to.\"\n\nHe saw that the opposing force wavered at this.\n\n\"I want no trouble, gentlemen,\" he went on. \"Believe me, I shall be\nhappy to have your company to dinner. Your command that I withdraw is\nill-timed, not to say ill-natured and impolite. Let us all forget it.\"\n\nThe mayor of Reuton turned away, and his dog slid into the shadows.\n\n\"Have I your promise to stay to dinner?\" went on Magee. No answer came\nfrom the trio in the dusk. \"Silence gives consent,\" he added gaily. \"You\nmust excuse me while I dress. Bland, will you inform Mr. Peters that we\nare to have company to dinner? Handle him gently. Emphasize the fact\nthat our guests are men.\"\n\nHe ran up the stairs. At the top of the second flight he met the girl,\nand her eyes, he thought, shone in the dark.\n\n\"Oh, I'm so glad,\" she whispered.\n\n\"Glad of what?\" asked Magee.\n\n\"That you are not on their side,\" she answered.\n\nMr. Magee paused at the door of number seven.\n\n\"I should say not,\" he remarked. \"Whatever it's all about, I should say\nnot. Put on your prettiest gown, my lady. I've invited the mayor to\ndinner.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nTHE MAYOR BEGINS A VIGIL\n\n\nOne summer evening, in dim dead days gone by, an inexperienced head\nwaiter at Baldpate Inn had attempted to seat Mrs. J. Sanderson Clark, of\nPittsburgh, at the same table with the unassuming Smiths, of Tiffin,\nOhio. The remarks of Mrs. Clark, who was at the time busily engaged in\ntrying to found a first family, lingered long in the memory of those who\nheard them. So long, in fact, that Miss Norton, standing with Mr. Magee\nin the hotel office awaiting the signal from Peters that dinner was\nready, could repeat them almost verbatim. Mr. Magee cast a humorous look\nabout.\n\n\"Lucky the manners and customs of the summer folks aren't carried over\ninto the winter,\" he said. \"Imagine a Mrs. Clark asked to sit at table\nwith the mayor of Reuton and his picturesque but somewhat soiled friend,\nMr. Max. I hope the dinner is a huge success.\"\n\nThe girl laughed.\n\n\"The natural nervousness of a host,\" she remarked. \"Don't worry. The\nhermit and his tins won't fail you.\"\n\n\"It's not the culinary end that worries me,\" smiled Magee. \"It's the\nrepartee and wit. I want the mayor to feel at home. Do you know any good\nstories ascribed to Congressman Jones, of the Asquewan district?\"\n\nTogether they strolled to a window. The snow had begun to fall again,\nand the lights of the little hamlet below showed but dimly through the\nwhite blur.\n\n\"I want you to know,\" said the girl, \"that I trust you now. And when the\ntime comes, as it will soon--to-night--I am going to ask you to help me.\nI may ask a rather big thing, and ask you to do it blindly, just\ntrusting in me, as I refused to trust in you.\" She stopped and looked\nvery seriously into Mr. Magee's face.\n\n\"I'm mighty glad,\" he answered in a low tone. \"From the moment I saw you\nweeping in the station I've wanted to be of help to you. The station\nagent advised me not to interfere. He said to become involved with a\nweeping woman meant trouble. The fool. As though any trouble--\"\n\n\"He was right,\" put in the girl, \"it probably will mean trouble.\"\n\n\"As though any storm,\" finished Mr. Magee \"would not be worth the\nrainbow of your smile at the end.\"\n\n\"A very fancy figure,\" laughed she. \"But storms aren't nice.\"\n\n\"There are a few of us,\" replied Magee, \"who can be merry through the\nworst of them because of the rainbow to come.\"\n\nFor answer, she flattened her finely-modeled nose into shapelessness\nagainst the cold pane. Back of them in the candle-lighted room, the\nmotley crew of Baldpate's winter guests stood about in various attitudes\nof waiting. In front of the fire the holder of the Chair of Comparative\nLiterature quoted poetry to Mrs. Norton, and probably it never occurred\nto the old man that the woman to whom he talked was that nightmare of\nhis life--a peroxide blonde. Ten feet away in the flickering half-light,\nthe immense bulk of the mayor of Reuton reposed on the arm of a leather\ncouch, and before him stood his lithe unpleasant companion, Lou Max,\nside by side with Mr. Bland, whose talk of haberdashery was forever\nstilled. The candles sputtered, the storm angrily rattled the windows;\nMr. Peters flitted like a hairy wraith about the table. So the strange\ngame that was being played at Baldpate Inn followed the example of good\ndigestion and waited on appetite.\n\nWhat Mr. Magee flippantly termed his dinner party was seated at last,\nand there began a meal destined to linger long in the memories of those\nwho partook if it. Puzzled beyond words, the host took stock of his\nguests. Opposite him, at the foot of the table, he could see the lined\ntired face of Mrs. Norton, dazed, uncomprehending, a little frightened.\nAt his right the great red acreage of Cargan's face held defiance and\nsome amusement; beside it sneered the cruel face of Max; beyond that Mr.\nBland's countenance told a story of worry and impotent anger. And on Mr.\nMagee's left sat the professor, bearded, spectacled, calm, seemingly\nundisturbed by this queer flurry of events, beside the fair girl of the\nstation who trusted Magee at last. In the first few moments of silence\nMr. Magee compared her delicate features with the coarse knowing face of\nthe woman at the table's foot, and inwardly answered \"No.\"\n\nWithout the genial complement of talk the dinner began. Mr. Peters\nappeared with another variety of his canned soup, whereupon the silence\nwas broken by the gastronomic endeavors of Mr. Max and the mayor. Mr.\nMagee was reflecting that conversation must be encouraged, when Cargan\nsuddenly spoke.\n\n\"I hope I ain't putting you folks out none,\" he remarked with obvious\nsarcasm. \"It ain't my habit to drop in unexpected like this. But\nbusiness--\"\n\n\"We're delighted, I'm sure,\" said Mr. Magee politely.\n\n\"I suppose you want to know why I'm here,\" the mayor went on.\n\"Well--\" he hesitated--\"it's like this--\"\n\n\"Dear Mr. Cargan,\" Magee broke in, \"spare us, I pray. And spare\nyourself. We have had explanations until we are weary. We have decided\nto drop them altogether, and just to take it for granted that, in the\nwords of the song, we're here because we're here.\"\n\n\"All right,\" replied Cargan, evidently relieved. \"That suits me. I'm\ntired explaining, anyhow. There's a bunch of reformers rose up lately in\nReuton--maybe you've heard about 'em. A lovely bunch. A white necktie\nand a half-portion of brains apiece. They say they're going to do for me\nat the next election.\"\n\nMr. Max laughed harshly from the vicinity of his soup.\n\n\"They wrote the first joke book, them people,\" he said.\n\n\"Well,\" went on Cargan, \"there ain't nobody so insignificant and\npiffling that people won't listen to 'em when they attack a man in\npublic life. So I've had to reply to this comic opera bunch, and as I\nsay, I'm about wore out explaining. I've had to explain that I never\nstole the town I used to live in in Indiana, and that I didn't stick up\nmy father with a knife. It gets monotonous. So I'm much obliged to you\nfor passing the explanations up. We won't bother you long, me and Lou. I\ngot a little business here, and then we'll mosey along. We'll clear out\nabout nine o'clock.\"\n\n\"No,\" protested Magee. \"So soon? We must make it pleasant for you while\nyou stay. I always hate hosts who talk about their servants--I have a\nfriend who bores me to death because he has a Jap butler he believes was\nat Mukden. But I think I am justified in calling your attention to\nours--Mr. Peters, the Hermit of Baldpate Mountain. Cooking is merely his\navocation. He is writing a book.\"\n\n\"That guy,\" remarked Cargan, incredulous.\n\n\"What do you know about that?\" asked Mr. Bland. \"It certainly will get a\nlot of hot advertising if it ever appears. It's meant to prove that all\nthe trouble in the world has been caused by woman.\"\n\nThe mayor considered.\n\n\"He's off--he's nutty, that fellow,\" he announced. \"It ain't women that\ncause all of the trouble.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Mr. Cargan,\" said Miss Norton, smiling.\n\n\"Anybody'd know it to look at you, miss,\" replied the mayor in his most\ngallant manner. Then he added hastily: \"And you, ma'am,\" with a nod in\nthe other woman's direction.\n\n\"I don't know as I got the evidence in my face,\" responded Mrs. Norton\neasily, \"but women don't make no trouble, I know that. I think the man's\ncrazy, myself, and I'd tell him so if he wasn't the cook.\" She paused,\nfor Peters had entered the room. There was silence while he changed the\ncourses. \"It's getting so now you can't say the things to a cook you can\nto a king,\" she finished, after the hermit had retired.\n\n\"Ahem--Mr. Cargan,\" put in Professor Bolton, \"you give it as your\nopinion that woman is no trouble-maker, and I must admit that I agree\nwith your premise in general, although occasionally she may cause a--a\nslight annoyance. Undeniably, there is a lot of trouble in the world. To\nwhose efforts do you ascribe it?\"\n\nThe mayor ran his thick fingers through his hair.\n\n\"I got you,\" he said, \"and I got your answer, too. Who makes the\ntrouble? Who's made it from the beginning of time? The reformers, Doc.\nYes, sir. Who was the first reformer? The snake in the garden of Eden.\nThis hermit guy probably has that affair laid down at woman's door. Not\nmuch. Everything was running all right around the garden, and then the\nsnake came along. It's a twenty to one shot he'd just finished a series\nof articles on 'The Shame of Eden' for a magazine. 'What d'ye mean?' he\nsays to the woman, 'by letting well enough alone? Things are all wrong\nhere. The present administration is running everything into the ground.\nI can tell you a few things that will open your eyes. What's that? What\nyou don't know won't hurt you? The old cry', he says, 'the old cry\nagainst which progressives got to fight,' he says. 'Wake up. You need a\nchange here. Try this nice red apple, and you'll see things the way I\ndo.' And the woman fell for it. You know what happened.\"\n\n\"An original point of view,\" said the dazed professor.\n\n\"Yes, Doc,\" went on Mr. Cargan, evidently on a favorite topic, \"it's the\nreformers that have caused all the trouble, from that snake down. Things\nare running smooth, folks all prosperous and satisfied--then they come\nalong in their gum shoes and white neckties. And they knock away at the\nexisting order until the public begins to believe 'em and gives 'em a\nchance to run things. What's the result? The world's in a worse tangle\nthan ever before.\"\n\n\"You feel deeply on the subject, Mr. Cargan,\" remarked Magee.\n\n\"I ought to,\" the mayor replied. \"I ain't no writer, but if I was, I'd\nturn out a book that would drive this whiskered hermit's argument to the\nwall. Woman--bah! The only way women make trouble is by falling for the\nreform gag.\"\n\nMr. Peters here interrupted with the dessert, and through that course\nMr. Cargan elaborated on his theory. He pointed out how, in many states,\nreform had interrupted the smooth flow of life, set everything awhirl,\nand cruelly sent \"the boys\" who had always been faithful out into the\ncold world seeking the stranger, work. While he talked, the eyes of Lou\nMax looked out at him from behind the incongruous gold-rimmed glasses,\nwith the devotion of the dog to its master clearly written in them. Mr.\nMagee had read many articles about this picturesque Cargan who had\nfought his way with his fists to the position of practical dictator in\nthe city of Reuton. The story was seldom told without a mention of his\nman Max--Lou Max who kept the south end of Reuton in line for the mayor,\nand in that low neighborhood of dives and squalor made Cargan's a name\nto conjure with. Watching him now, Mr. Magee marveled at this cheap\ncreature's evident capacity for loyalty.\n\n\"It was the reformers got Napoleon,\" the mayor finished. \"Yes, they sent\nNapoleon to an island at the end. And him without an equal since the\nworld began.\"\n\n\"Is your--begging your pardon--is your history just straight?\" demurred\nProfessor Bolton timidly.\n\n\"Is it?\" frowned Cargan. \"You can bet it is. I know Napoleon from the\ncradle to the grave. I ain't an educated man, Doc--I can hire all the\neducated men I want for eighteen dollars a week--but I'm up on\nBonaparte.\"\n\n\"It seems to me,\" Miss Norton put in, \"I have heard--did I read it in a\npaper?--that a picture of Napoleon hangs above your desk. They say that\nyou see in your own career, a similarity to his. May I ask--is it true?\"\n\n\"No, miss,\" replied Cargan. \"That's a joking story some newspaper guy\nwrote up. It ain't got no more truth in it than most newspaper yarn. No,\nI ain't no Napoleon. There's lots of differences between us--one in\nparticular.\" He raised his voice, and glared at the company around the\ntable. \"One in particular. The reformers got Napoleon at the end.\"\n\n\"But the end is not yet,\" suggested Mr. Magee, smiling.\n\nMr. Cargan gave him a sudden and interested look.\n\n\"I ain't worrying,\" he replied. \"And don't you, young fellow.\"\n\nMr. Magee responded that he was not one to indulge in needless worry,\nand a silence fell upon the group. Peters entered with coffee, and was\nengaged in pouring it when Mr. Bland started up wildly from the table\nwith an expression of alarm on his face.\n\n\"What's that?\" he cried.\n\nThe others looked at him in wonder.\n\n\"I heard steps up-stairs,\" he declared.\n\n\"Nonsense,\" said Mr. Cargan, \"you're dreaming. This peace and quiet has\ngot to you, Bland.\"\n\nWithout replying, Mr. Bland rose and ran up the stair. In his absence\nthe Hermit of Baldpate spoke into Magee's ear.\n\n\"I ain't one to complain,\" he said; \"livin' alone as much as I do I've\nsort of got out of the habit, having nobody to complain to. But if folks\nkeep coming and coming to this hotel, I've got to resign as cook. Seems\nas though every few minutes there's a new face at the table, and it's a\nvital matter to me.\"\n\n\"Cheer up, Peters,\" whispered Mr. Magee. \"There are only two more keys\nto the inn. There will be a limit to our guests.\"\n\n\"What I'm getting at is,\" replied Mr. Peters, \"there's a limit to my\nendurance.\"\n\nMr. Bland came down-stairs. His face was very pale as he took his seat,\nbut in reply to Cargan's question he remarked that he must have been\nmistaken.\n\n\"It was the wind, I guess,\" he said.\n\nThe mayor made facetious comment on Mr. Bland's \"skittishness\", and Mr.\nMax also indulged in a gibe or two. These the haberdasher met with a wan\nsmile. So the dinner came to an end, and the guests of Baldpate sat\nabout while Mr. Peters removed all traces of it from the table. Mr.\nMagee sought to talk to Miss Norton, but found her nervous and distrait.\n\n\"Has Mr. Bland frightened you?\" he asked.\n\nShe shook her head. \"I have other things to think of,\" she replied.\n\nMr. Peters shortly bade the company good-by for the night, with the\nwarmly expressed hope in Mr. Magee's ear that there would be no further\nadditions to the circle in the near future. When he had started off\nthrough the snow for his shack, Mr. Cargan took out his watch.\n\n\"You've been pretty kind to us poor wanderers already,\" he said. \"I got\none more favor to ask. I come up here to see Mr. Bland. We got some\nbusiness to transact, and we'd consider it a great kindness if you was\nto leave us alone here in the office.\"\n\nMr. Magee hesitated. He saw the girl nod her head slightly, and move\ntoward the stairs.\n\n\"Certainly, if you wish,\" he said. \"I hope you won't go without saying\ngood-by, Mr. Cargan.\"\n\n\"That all depends,\" replied the mayor. \"I've enjoyed knowing you, one\nand all. Good night.\"\n\nThe women, the professor and Mr. Magee moved up the broad stairway. On\nthe landing Mr. Magee heard the voice of Mrs. Norton, somewhere in the\ndarkness ahead.\n\n\"I'm worried, dearie--real worried.\"\n\n\"Hush,\" came the girl's voice. \"Mr. Magee-we'll meet again--soon.\"\n\nMr. Magee seized the professor's arm, and together they stood in the\nshadows.\n\n\"I don't like the looks of things,\" came Bland's hoarse complaint from\nbelow. \"What time is it?\"\n\n\"Seven-thirty.\" Cargan answered. \"A good half-hour yet.\"\n\n\"There was somebody on the second floor when I went up,\" Bland\ncontinued. \"I saw him run into one of the rooms and lock the door.\"\n\n\"I've got charge now,\" the mayor reassured him, \"don't you worry.\"\n\n\"There's something doing.\" This seemed to be Max's voice.\n\n\"There sure is,\" laughed Cargan. \"But what do I care? I own young\nDrayton. I put him where he is. I ain't afraid. Let them gumshoe round\nas much as they want to. They can't touch me.\"\n\n\"Maybe not,\" said Bland. \"But Baldpate Inn ain't the grand idea it\nlooked at first, is it?\"\n\n\"It's a hell of an idea,\" answered Cargan. \"There wasn't any need of all\nthis folderol. I told Hayden so. Does that phone ring?\"\n\n\"No--it'll just flash a light, when they want us,\" Bland told him.\n\nMr. Magee and Professor Bolton continued softly up the stairs, and in\nanswer to the former's invitation, the old man entered number seven and\ntook a chair by the fire.\n\n\"It is an amazing tangle,\" he remarked, \"in which we are involved. I\nhave no idea what your place is in the scheme of things up here. But I\nassume you grasp what is going on, if I do not. I am not so keen of wit\nas I once was.\"\n\n\"If you think,\" answered Mr. Magee, proffering a cigar, \"that I am in on\nthis little game of 'Who's Who', then you are vastly mistaken. As a\nmatter of fact, I am as much in the dark as you are.\"\n\nThe professor smiled.\n\n\"Indeed,\" he said in a tone that showed his unbelief. \"Indeed.\"\n\nHe was deep in a discussion of the meters of the poet Chaucer when there\ncame a knock at the door, and Mr. Lou Max's unpleasant head was thrust\ninside.\n\n\"I been assigned,\" he said, \"to sit up here in the hall and keep an eye\nout for the ghost Bland heard tramping about. And being of a sociable\nnature, I'd like to sit in your doorway, if you don't mind.\"\n\n\"By all means,\" replied Magee. \"Here's a chair. Do you smoke?\"\n\n\"Thanks.\" Mr. Max placed the chair sidewise in the doorway of number\nseven, and sat down. From his place he commanded a view of Mr. Magee's\napartments and of the head of the stairs. With his yellow teeth he\nviciously bit the end from the cigar. \"Don't let me interrupt the\nconversation, gentlemen,\" he pleaded.\n\n\"We were speaking,\" said the professor calmly, \"of the versification of\nChaucer. Mr. Magee--\"\n\nHe continued his discussion in an even voice, Mr. Magee leaned back in\nhis chair and smiled in a pleased way at the settings of the stage: Mr.\nMax in a cloud of smoke on guard at his door; the mayor and Mr. Bland\nkeeping vigil by a telephone switchboard in the office below, watching\nfor the flash of light that should tell them some one in the outside\nworld wanted to speak to Baldpate Inn; a mysterious figure who flitted\nabout in the dark; a beautiful girl who was going to ask Mr. Magee to do\nher a service, blindly trusting her.\n\nThe professor droned on monotonously. Once Mr. Magee interrupted to\nengage Lou Max in spirited conversation. For, through the squares of\nlight outside the windows, he had seen the girl of the station pass\nhurriedly down the balcony, the snowflakes falling white on her yellow\nhair.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nMR. MAX TELLS A TALE OF SUSPICION\n\n\nAn hour passed. Mr. Max admitted when pressed that a good cigar soothed\nthe soul, and accepted another from Magee's stock. The professor\ncontinued to talk. Obviously it was his favorite diversion. He seemed to\nbe quoting from addresses; Mr. Magee pictured him on a Chautauqua\nplatform, the white water pitcher by his side.\n\nAs he talked, Mr. Magee studied that portion of his delicate scholarly\nface that the beard left exposed to the world. What part had Thaddeus\nBolton, holder of the Crandall Chair of Comparative Literature, in this\nnetwork of odd alarms? Why was he at Baldpate? And why was he so little\nmoved by the rapid changes in the make-up of the inn colony--changes\nthat left Mr. Magee gasping? He took them as calmly as he would take his\ngrapefruit at the breakfast-table. Only that morning Mr. Magee, by way\nof experiment, had fastened upon him the suspicion of murder, and the\nold man had not flickered an eyelash. Not the least strange of all the\nstrange figures that floated about Baldpate, Mr. Magee reflected, was\nthis man who fiddled now with Chaucer while, metaphorically, Rome\nburned. He could not make it out.\n\nMr. Max inserted a loud yawn into the professor's discourse.\n\n\"Once I played chess with a German,\" he said, \"and another time I went\nto a lecture on purifying politics, but I never struck anything so\nmonotonous as this job I got now.\"\n\n\"So sorry,\" replied Magee, \"that our company bores you.\"\n\n\"No offense,\" remarked the yellow-faced one. \"I was just thinking as I\nset here how it all comes of people being suspicious of one another. Now\nI've always held that the world would be a better place if there wasn't\nno suspicion in it. Nine times out of ten the suspicion ain't got a leg\nto stand on--if suspicion can be said to have a leg.\"\n\nEvidently Mr. Max desired the floor; graciously Professor Bolton\nconceded it to him.\n\n\"Speaking of suspicion,\" continued the drab little man on the threshold,\nturning his cigar thoughtfully between his thin lips, \"reminds me of a\ncase told me by Pueblo Sam, a few years ago. In some ways it's real\nfunny, and in others it's sad as hell. Pueblo Sam was called in them\nterms because he'd never been west of Sixth Avenue. He was a swell\nrefined gentleman who lived by his wits, and he had considerable.\"\n\n\"A confidence man,\" suggested Magee.\n\n\"Something along that order,\" admitted Mr. Max, \"but a good sport among\nhis friends, you understand. Well, this case of suspicion Sam tells me\nabout happened something like this. One scorching hot day in summer Sam\ngets aboard the Coney boat, his idea being to put all business cares\naway for an hour or two, and just float calm and peaceful down the bay,\nand cool off. So he grabs out a camp chair and hustles through the crowd\nup to the top deck, beside the pilot's hangout, and sits down to get\nacquainted with the breeze, if such there was.\n\n\"Well, he'd been sitting there about ten minutes, Sam tells me, when\nalong came about the easiest picking that ever got loose from the old\nhomestead--\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon,\" protested Professor Bolton.\n\n\"The ready money, the loosened kale, the posies in the garden waiting to\nbe plucked,\" elucidated Mr. Max. \"This guy, Sam says, was such a perfect\nrube he just naturally looked past him to see if there was a trail of\nwisps of hay on the floor. For a while Sam sits there with a grouch as\nhe thought how hard it was to put business aside and get a little rest\nnow and then, and debating whether, being on a vacation, as it was, he'd\nexert himself enough to stretch forth his hand and take whatever money\nthe guy had. While he was arguing the matter with himself, the jay\nsettled the question by coming over and sitting down near him.\n\n\"He's in the city, he tells Sam, to enjoy the moving pictures of the\nstreets, and otherwise forget the trees back home that grow the cherries\nin the bottom of the cocktail glasses. 'And believe me,' he says to Sam,\n'there ain't none of those confidence men going to get me. I'm too\nwise,' he says.\n\n\"'I'll bet money you are,' Sam tells him laughing all over at the fish\nthat was fighting to get into the net.\n\n\"'Yes, siree,' says the last of the Mohicans, 'they can't fool me. I can\ntell them as fur away as I can see 'em, and my eyesight's perfect. One\nof 'em comes up to me in City Hall park and tries to sell me some mining\nstock. I guess he ain't recovered yet from what I said to him. I tell\nyou, they can't fool Mark Dennen,' says the guy.\n\n\"Sam told me that at them words he just leaned back in his seat and\nstared at the jay and whistled under his breath. Years ago, it seemed,\nSam had lived in the town of Readsboro, Vermont, and run up and down the\nstreets with one suspender and a stone bruise, and the kid that had run\nwith him was Mark Dennen. And Sam says he looked at this guy from the\nwoods that was running round crying to high heaven he needed a guardian,\nand he sees that sure enough it was the tow-head Mark Dennen and--Sam\ntold me--something seemed to bust inside him, and he wanted to stretch\nout his arms and hug this guy.\n\n\"'Mark Dennen,' shouts Sam, 'as I live. Of Readsboro, Vermont. The kid I\nused to play with under the arc lights--don't you remember me?'\n\n\"But Sam says the guy just looked him straight in the eye and shut his\njaw, and says: 'I suppose you'll be asking after my brother George\nnext?'\n\n\"'You ain't got any brother George, you idiot,' laughs Sam. He told me\nhe was thinking how he'd treat his old friend Mark to a dinner that\nwould go down in history in Readsboro. 'Mark, you old rascal,' he says,\n'don't you remember me--don't you remember little Sam Burns that used to\nplay andy-over with you, and that stole your girl in 1892? Don't you\nremember the old days in Readsboro?' He was all het up by this time, Sam\ntells me, and all the old memories came creeping back, and he kept\nthinking he never was so glad to run across anybody in his life. 'You\nremember little Sam Burns, don't you?' he asks once more.\n\n\"But this guy just looks back into Sam's eye with his own cold as steel,\nand he says, says he: 'You're pretty clever, mister, but you don't fool\nme. No, you don't come any games on Mark Dennen.'\n\n\"'But, Mark,' says Sam, 'I swear to you by all that's holy that I'm that\nkid--I'm Sam Burns. What proof do you want? Do you remember old Ed\nHaywood that used to keep the drug store right across from the\npost-office? The guy that never washed his windows? I do. And Miss\nHunter that taught the sixth grade school when we went there--a little\nwoman with washed-out gray eyes and a broken front tooth? And that\npretty little girl, Sarah somebody--wait a minute, I'll get it or\nbust--Sarah--Sarah--Sarah Scott, you used to be so sweet on? Did you\nmarry her, Mark? And old Lafe Perkins, who used to be on hand whenever\nthere was any repairs being made anywhere--rheumatism and a cane and a\nhigh squeaky voice that he used to exercise giving orders about things\nthat wasn't any of his business. Why, Mark, I remember 'em all. Good\nlord, man,' says Sam, 'do you want any more proof?'\n\n\"But this country blockhead just looked Sam up and down, and remarks\njudicious: 'It's certainly wonderful how you know all these things.\nWonderful. But you can't fool me,' he says, 'you can't fool Mark\nDennen.'\"\n\nMr. Max paused in his narrative for a moment. The sound of voices came\nup from the office of Baldpate Inn. One, that of the mayor, boomed\nloudly and angrily. In an evident desire to drown it, Mr. Max went on\nwith spirit:\n\n\"Well, gentlemen, it got to be a point of honor, as you might say, for\nSam to convince that guy. He told me he never wanted anything so much in\nhis life as for Mark Dennen to give in. It was a hot afternoon, and he'd\ncome aboard that boat for a rest, but he peeled off his collar and\nstarted in. He gave Mark Dennen the number of bricks in the Methodist\nChurch, as reported in the Readsboro _Citizen_ at the time it was built.\nHe told him the name of the piece Mark's sister recited at the school\nentertainment in the spring of 1890. He bounded on all four sides the\nlot where the circuses played when they came to Readsboro. He named\nevery citizen of the town, living or dead, that ever got to be known\noutside his own family, and he brought children into the world and\nmarried them and read the funeral service over them, and still that\nbonehead from the woods sat there, his mouth open, and says: 'It's\nbeyond me how you know all that. You New Yorkers are slicker then I give\nye credit for. But you can't fool me. You ain't Sam Burns. Why, I went\nto school with him.'\n\n\"They was drawing near Coney now,\" went on Mr. Max, \"and Sam's face was\npurple and he was dripping with perspiration, and rattling off Readsboro\nhappenings at the rate of ten a second, but that Mark Dennen he sat\nthere and wouldn't budge from his high horse. So they came up to the\npier, Sam almost weeping real tears and pleading like his heart would\nbreak: 'Mark, don't you remember that time we threw little Bill Barnaby\ninto the swimming hole, and he couldn't swim a stroke and nearly drowned\non us?' and still getting the stony face from his old pal.\n\n\"And on the pier this Dennen held out his hand to Sam, who was a\nphysical wreck and a broken man by this time, and says: 'You sure are\ncute, mister. I'll have great times telling this in Readsboro. Once you\nmet one too smart for ye, eh? Much obliged for your company, anyhow!'\nAnd he went away and left Sam leaning against the railing, with no faith\nin human nature no more. 'I hope somebody got to him,' says Sam to me,\n'and got to him good. He's the kind that if you work right you can sell\nstock in a company for starting roof gardens on the tops of the pyramids\nin Egypt. I'd trimmed him myself,' says Sam to me, 'but I hadn't the\nheart.'\"\n\nMr. Max finished, and again from below came the sound of voices raised\nin anger.\n\n\"An interesting story, Mr. Max,\" commented Professor Bolton. \"I shall\ntreasure it.\"\n\n\"Told with a remarkable feeling for detail,\" added Mr. Magee. \"In fact,\nit seems to me that only one of the two participants in it could\nremember all the fine points so well. Mr. Max, you don't exactly look\nlike Mark Dennen to me, therefore--if you will pardon the liberty--\"\n\n\"I get you,\" replied Max sadly. \"The same old story.\nSuspicion--suspicion everywhere. It does a lot of harm, believe me. I\nwouldn't--\"\n\nHe jumped from his chair and disappeared, for the voice of Cargan had\nhailed him from below. Mr. Magee and the professor with one accord\nfollowed. Hiding in the friendly shadows of the landing once again, they\nheard the loud tones of the mayor's booming voice, and the softer tones\nof Bland's.\n\n\"How about this?\" bellowed the mayor. \"Hayden's squealed. Phones to\nBland--not to me. Whines about the courts--I don't know what rot. He's\nsquealed. He didn't phone the combination.\"\n\n\"The rat!\" screamed Mr. Max.\n\n\"By the Lord Harry,\" said the mayor, \"I'll have it open, anyhow. I've\nearned what's in there, fair and--I've earned it. I'm going to have it,\nMax.\"\n\n\"See here, Cargan--\" put in Mr. Bland.\n\n\"Keep out of the way, you,\" cried Cargan. \"And put away that pop-gun\nbefore you get hurt. I'm going to have what's mine by justice. That safe\ncomes open to-night. Max, get your satchel.\"\n\nMr. Magee and the professor turned and ascended to the second floor. In\nfront of number seven they paused and looked into each other's eyes.\nProfessor Bolton shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"I'm going to bed,\" he said, \"and I advise you to do the same.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Mr. Magee, but had no idea what he had said. As for the\nold man's advice, he had no intention of taking it. Melodrama--the thing\nhe had come to Baldpate Inn to forget forever--raged through that home\nof solitude. Men spoke of guns, and swore, and threatened. What was it\nall about? And what part could he play in it all?\n\nHe entered number seven, and paused in amazement. Outside one of his\nwindows Miss Norton stood, rapping on the glass for him to open. When he\nstood facing her at last, the window no longer between, he saw that her\nface was very pale and that her chin trembled as it had in the station.\n\n\"What is it?\" cried Magee.\n\n\"I mustn't come in,\" she answered. \"Listen. You said you wanted to help\nme. You can do so now. I'll explain everything later--this is all I need\ntell you just at present. Down-stairs in the safe there's a package\ncontaining two hundred thousand dollars. Do you hear--two hundred\nthousand. I must have that package. Don't ask me why. I came here to get\nit--I must have it. The combination was to have been phoned to Cargan at\neight o'clock. I was hiding outside the window. Something went\nwrong--they didn't phone it. He's going to open the safe by force. I\nheard him say so. I couldn't wait to hear more--I saw him.\"\n\n\"Who?\" asked Mr. Magee.\n\n\"I don't know--a tall black figure--hiding outside a window like myself.\nThe man with one of the other keys, I suppose. The man Mr. Bland heard\nwalking about to-night. I saw him and I was terribly frightened. It's\nall right when you know who the other fellow is, but when--it's all so\ncreepy--I was afraid. So I ran--here.\"\n\n\"The thing to do,\" approved Mr. Magee. \"Don't worry. I'll get the money\nfor you. I'll get it if I have to slay the city administration of Reuton\nin its tracks.\"\n\n\"You trust me?\" asked the girl, with a little catch in her voice. The\nsnow lay white on her hair; even in the shadows her eyes suggested June\nskies. \"Without knowing who I am, or why I must have this money--you'll\nget it for me?\"\n\n\"Some people,\" said Mr. Magee, \"meet all their lives long at pink little\nteas, and never know one another, while others just smile at each other\nacross a station waiting-room--that's enough.\"\n\n\"I'm so glad,\" whispered the girl. \"I never dreamed I'd meet any one\nlike you--up here. Please, oh, please, be very careful. Neither Cargan\nnor Max is armed. Bland is. I should never forgive myself if you were\nhurt. But you won't be--will you?\"\n\n\"I may catch cold,\" laughed Mr. Magee; \"otherwise I'll be perfectly\nsafe.\" He went into the room and put on a gay plaid cap. \"Makes me look\nlike Sherlock Holmes,\" he smiled at the girl framed in the window. When\nhe turned to his door to lock it, he discovered that the key was gone\nand that it had been locked on the outside. \"Oh, very well,\" he said\nflippantly. He buttoned his coat to the chin, blew out the candles in\nnumber seven, and joined the girl on the balcony.\n\n\"Go to your room,\" he said gently. \"Your worries are over. I'll bring\nyou the golden fleece inside an hour.\"\n\n\"Be careful,\" she whispered, \"Be very careful, Mr.--Billy.\"\n\n\"Just for that,\" cried Magee gaily, \"I'll get you _four_ hundred\nthousand dollars.\"\n\nHe ran to the end of the balcony, and dropping softly to the ground, was\nready for his first experiment in the gentle art of highway robbery.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nMELODRAMA IN THE SNOW\n\n\nThe justly celebrated moon that in summer months shed so much glamour on\nthe romances of Baldpate Inn was no where in evidence as Mr. Magee crept\nalong the ground close to the veranda. The snow sifted down upon him out\nof the blackness above; three feet ahead the world seemed to end.\n\n\"A corking night,\" he muttered humorously, \"for my debut in the hold-up\nbusiness.\"\n\nHe swung up over the rail on to the veranda, and walked softly along it\nuntil he came to a window opening into the office. Cautiously he peered\nin. The vast lonely room was lighted by a single candle. At the foot of\nthe broad stair he could discern a great bulk, seated on the lowest\nstep, which he correctly took to be the mayor of Reuton. Back of the\ndesk, on which stood the candle, Mr. Max's head and shoulders were\nvisible. He was working industriously in the immediate vicinity of the\nsafe door. Occasionally he consulted the small traveling-bag that stood\non the desk. Many other professions had claimed Mr. Max before his\nadvent into Reuton politics; evidently he was putting into operation the\ntraining acquired in one of them. Mr. Bland was nowhere in sight.\n\nShivering with cold and excitement, Mr. Magee leaned against the side of\nBaldpate Inn and waited. Mr. Max worked eagerly, turning frequently to\nhis bag as a physician might turn to his medicine-case. No word was\nspoken in the office. Minutes passed. The bulk at the foot of the stairs\nsurged restlessly. Mr. Max's operations were mostly hidden by the desk\nat which, in summer, timid old ladies inquired for their mail. Having\ntime to think, Mr. Magee pictured the horror of those ladies could they\ncome up to the desk at Baldpate now.\n\nSuddenly Mr. Max ran out into the center of the office. Almost on the\ninstant there was a white puff of smoke and a roar. The inn seemed about\nto roll down the mountain after all those years of sticking tight. The\nmayor looked apprehensively up the stair behind him; Mr. Max ran to the\nopen safe door and came back before the desk with a package in his hand.\nAfter examining it hastily, Mr. Cargan placed the loot in his pocket.\nThe greedy eyes of Max followed it for a second; then he ran over and\ngathered up his tools. Now they were ready to depart. The mayor lifted\nthe candle from the desk. Its light fell on a big chair by the fire, and\nMr. Magee saw in that chair the figure of Mr. Bland, bound and gagged.\n\nMr. Cargan and his companion paused, and appeared to address triumphant\nand jesting comment in Mr. Bland's direction. Then they buttoned their\ncoats and, holding aloft the candle, disappeared through the dining-room\ndoor.\n\n\"I must have that package.\" Standing on the balcony of Baldpate Inn, her\nyellow hair white with snow, her eyes shining even in shadow, thus had\nthe lady of this weird drama spoken to Mr. Magee. And gladly he had\nundertaken the quest. Now, he knew, the moment had come to act. Max he\ncould quickly dispose of, he felt; Cargan would require time and\nattention.\n\nHe hurried round to the front door of the inn, and taking the big key\nfrom his pocket, unlocked it as a means of retreat where the men he was\nabout to attack could not follow. Already he heard their muffled steps\nin the distance. Crossing the veranda, he dropped down into the snow by\nthe side of the great stone steps that led to Baldpate Inn's chief\nentrance.\n\nHe heard Cargan and Max on the veranda just above his head. They were\nspeaking of trains to Reuton. In great good humor, evidently, they\nstarted down the steps. Mr. Magee crouched, resolved that he would\nspring the moment they reached the ground. They were on the last\nstep--now!\n\nSuddenly from the other side of the steps a black figure rose, a fist\nshot out, and Mr. Max went spinning like a whirling dervish down the\nsnowy path, to land in a heap five feet away. The next instant the mayor\nof Reuton and the black figure were locked in terrific conflict. Mr.\nMagee, astounded by this turn of affairs, could only stand and stare\nthrough the dark.\n\nFor fifteen seconds, muttering, slipping, grappling, the two figures\nwaltzed grotesquely about in the falling snow. Then the mayor's feet\nslid from under him on the treacherous white carpet, and the two went\ndown together. As Mr. Magee swooped down upon them he saw the hand of\nthe stranger find the mayor's pocket, and draw from it the package that\nhad been placed there in the office a few moments before.\n\nUnfortunately for the demands of the drama in which he had become\ninvolved, Mr. Magee had never been an athlete at the university. But he\nwas a young man of average strength and agility, and he had the\nadvantage of landing most unexpectedly on his antagonist. Before that\ngentleman realized what had happened, Magee had wrenched the package\nfrom his hand, thrown him back on the prostrate form of the highest\nofficial of Reuton, and fled up the steps. Quickly the stranger regained\nhis feet and started in pursuit, but he arrived at the great front door\nof Baldpate Inn just in time to hear the lock click inside.\n\nSafe for the moment behind a locked door, Mr. Magee paused to get his\nbreath. The glory of battle filled his soul. It was not until long\nafterward that he realized the battle had been a mere scuffle in the\ndark. He felt his cheeks burn with excitement like a sweet girl\ngraduate's--the cheeks of a man who had always prided himself he was the\nunmoved cynic in any situation.\n\nWith no thought for Mr. Bland, bound in his uneasy chair, Mr. Magee\nhurried up the broad staircase of Baldpate. Now came the most gorgeous\nscene of all. A fair-haired lady; a knight she had sent forth to battle;\nthe knight returned. \"You asked me to bring you this, my lady.\" Business\nof surprise and joy on the lady's part--business also, perhaps, of\nadoration for the knight.\n\nAt the right of the stairs lay seventeen and the lady, at the left a\nsupposedly uninhabited land. As Mr. Magee reached the second floor,\nblithely picturing the scene in which he was to play so satisfactory a\npart--he paused. For half-way down the corridor to the left an open door\nthrew a faint light into the hall, and in that light stood a woman he\nhad never seen before. In this order came Mr. Magee's impressions of\nher, fur-coated, tall, dark, handsome, with the haughty manner of one\nengaging a chauffeur.\n\n\"I beg your pardon,\" she said, \"but are you by any chance Mr. Magee?\"\n\nThe knight leaned weakly against the wall and tried to think.\n\n\"I--I am,\" he managed to say.\n\n\"I'm so glad I've found you,\" replied the girl. It seemed to the dazed\nMagee that her dark eyes were not overly happy. \"I can not ask you in,\nI'm afraid. I do not know the custom on such an occasion--does anybody?\nI am alone with my maid. Hal Bentley, when I wrote to him for a key to\nthis place, told me of your being here, and said that I was to put\nmyself under your protection.\"\n\nMr. Magee arranged a bow, most of which was lost in the dark.\n\n\"Delighted, I'm sure,\" he murmured.\n\n\"I shall try not to impose on you,\" she went on. \"The whole affair is so\nunusual as to be almost absurd. But Mr. Bentley said that you were--very\nkind. He said I might trust you. I am in great trouble. I have come here\nto get something--and I haven't the least idea how to proceed. I came\nbecause I must have it--so much depends on it.\"\n\nProphetically Mr. Magee clutched in his pocket the package for which he\nhad done battle.\n\n\"I may be too late.\" The girl's eyes grew wide. \"That would be terribly\nunfortunate. I do not wish you to be injured serving me--\" She lowered\nher voice. \"But if there is any way in which you can help me in--in this\ndifficulty--I can never be grateful enough. Down-stairs in the safe\nthere is, I believe, a package containing a large sum of money.\"\n\nMr. Magee's hand closed convulsively in his pocket.\n\n\"If there is any way possible,\" said the girl, \"I must obtain that\npackage. I give you my word I have as much right to it as any one who\nwill appear at the inn. The honor and happiness of one who is very dear\nto me is involved. I ask you--made bold as I am by my desperation and\nHal Bentley's assurances--to aid me if you find you can.\"\n\nWith the eyes of a man in a dream Mr. Magee looked into the face of the\nlatest comer to Baldpate.\n\n\"Hal Bentley is an old friend and a bully chap,\" he said. \"It will be a\ngreat pleasure to serve a friend of his.\" He paused, congratulating\nhimself that these were words, idle words. \"When did you arrive, may I\nask?\"\n\n\"I believe you were having dinner when I came,\" she answered. \"Mr.\nBentley gave me a key to the kitchen door, and we found a back stairway.\nThere seemed to be a company below--I wanted to see only you.\"\n\n\"I repeat,\" said Mr. Magee, \"I shall be happy to help you, if I can.\"\nHis word to another lady, he reflected, was binding. \"I suggest that\nthere is no harm in waiting until morning.\"\n\n\"But--I am afraid it was to-night--\" she began.\n\n\"I understand,\" Magee replied. \"The plans went wrong. You may safely let\nyour worries rest until to-morrow.\" He was on the point of adding\nsomething about relying on him, but remembered in time which girl he was\naddressing. \"Is there anything I can do to make you more comfortable?\"\n\nThe girl drew the fur coat closer about her shoulders. She suggested to\nMagee a sheltered luxurious life--he could see her regaling young men\nwith tea before a fireplace in a beautiful room--insipid tea in\nthimble-like cups.\n\n\"You are very kind,\" she said. \"I hardly expected to be here the night\nthrough. It is rather cold, but I am sure we have rugs and coats\nenough.\"\n\nMr. Magee's duty was clear.\n\n\"I'll build you a fire,\" he announced. The girl seemed distressed at the\nthought.\n\n\"No, I couldn't let you,\" she said. \"I am sure it isn't necessary. I\nwill say good night now.\"\n\n\"Good night. If there is anything I can do--\"\n\n\"I shall tell you,\" she finished, smiling. \"I believe I forgot to give\nyou my name. I am Myra Thornhill, of Reuton. Until to-morrow.\" She went\nin and closed the door.\n\nMr. Magee sat limply down on the cold stair. All the glory was gone from\nthe scene he had pictured a moment ago. He had the money, yes, the money\nprocured in valiant battle, but at the moment he bore the prize to his\nlady, another appeared from the dark to claim it. What should he do?\n\nHe got up and started for number seventeen. The girl who waited there\nwas very charming and attractive--but what did he know about her? What\ndid she want with this money? He paused This other girl came from Hal\nBentley, a friend of friends. And she claimed to have every right to\nthis precious package. What were her exact words?\n\nWhy not wait until morning? Perhaps, in the cold gray dawn, he would see\nmore clearly his way through this preposterous tangle. Anyhow, it would\nbe dangerous to give into any woman's keeping just then a package so\nearnestly sought by desperate men. Yes, he would wait until morning.\nThat was the only reasonable course.\n\nReasonable? That was the word he used. A knight prating of the\nreasonable!\n\nMr. Magee unlocked the door of number seven and entered. Lighting his\ncandles and prodding the fire, he composed a note to the waiting girl in\nseventeen:\n\n\"Everything all right. Sleep peacefully. I am on the job. Will see you\nto-morrow. Mr.--Billy.\"\n\nSlipping this message under her door, the ex-knight hurried away to\navoid an interview, and sat down in his chair before the fire.\n\n\"I must think,\" he muttered. \"I must get this thing straight.\"\n\nFor an hour he pondered, threshing out as best he could this mysterious\ngame in which he played a leading part unequipped with a book of rules.\nHe went back to the very beginning--even to the station at Upper\nAsquewan Falls where the undeniable charm of the first of these girls\nhad won him completely. He reviewed the arrival of Bland and his babble\nof haberdashery, of Professor Bolton and his weird tale of peroxide\nblondes and suffragettes, of Miss Norton and her impossible mother, of\nCargan, hater of reformers, and Lou Max, foe of suspicion. He thought of\nthe figure in the dark at the foot of the steps that had fought so\nsavagely for the package now in his own pocket--of the girl who had\npleaded so convincingly on the balcony for his help--of the colder, more\nsophisticated woman who came with Hal Bentley's authority to ask of him\nthe same favor. Myra Thornhill? He had heard the name, surely. But\nwhere?\n\nMr. Magee's thoughts went back to New York. He wondered what they would\nsay if they could see him now, whirling about in a queer romance not of\nhis own writing--he who had come to Baldpate Inn to get away from mere\nromancing and look into men's hearts, a philosopher. He laughed out\nloud.\n\n\"To-morrow is another day,\" he reflected. \"I'll solve this whole thing\nthen. They can't go on playing without me--I've got the ball.\"\n\nHe took the package from his pocket. Its seals had already been broken.\nUntying the strings, he began carefully to unwrap the paper--the thick\nyellow banking manila, and then the oiled inner wrapping. So finally he\nopened up the solid mass of--what? He looked closer. Crisp, beautiful,\none thousand dollar bills. Whew! He had never seen a bill of this size\nbefore. And here were two hundred of them.\n\nHe wrapped the package up once more, and prepared for bed. Just as he\nwas about to retire, he remembered Mr. Bland, bound and gagged below. He\nwent into the hall with the idea of releasing the unlucky haberdasher,\nbut from the office rose the voices of the mayor, Max, and Bland\nhimself. Peace, evidently, had been declared between them. Mr. Magee\nreturned to number seven, locked all the windows, placed the much-sought\npackage beneath his pillow, and after a half-hour of puzzling and\ntossing, fell asleep.\n\nIt was still quite dark when he awoke with a start. In the blackness he\ncould make out a figure standing by the side of his bed. He put his hand\nquickly beneath his pillow; the package was still there.\n\n\"What do you want?\" he asked, sitting up in bed.\n\nFor answer, the intruder sprang through the door and disappeared in the\ndarkness of the outer room. Mr. Magee followed. One of his windows\nslammed back and forth in the wind. Slipping on a dressing-gown and\nlighting a candle, he made an investigation. The glass above the lock\nhad been broken. Outside, in the snow on the balcony, were recent\nfootprints.\n\nSleepily Mr. Magee procured the precious package and put it in the\npocket of his gown. Then drawing on his shoes, he added a greatcoat to\nhis equipment, took a candle, and went out on to the balcony.\n\nThe storm had increased; the snow flurried and blustered; the windows of\nBaldpate Inn rattled wildly all about. It was difficult to keep the\ncandle burning in that wind. Mr. Magee followed the footprints along the\neast side of the inn to the corner, then along the more sheltered rear,\nand finally to the west side. On the west was a rather unlovely annex to\nthe main building, which increasing patronage had made necessary. It was\nconnected with the inn by a covered passageway from the second floor\nbalcony. At the entrance to this passageway the footprints stopped.\n\nEntering the dark passageway, Mr. Magee made his way to the door of the\nannex. He tried it. It was locked. But as he turned away, he heard\nvoices on the other side.\n\nMr. Magee had barely enough time to extinguish his candle and slip into\nthe shadows of the corner. The door of the annex opened. A man stepped\nout into the passageway. He stood there The light from a candle held by\nsome one in the doorway whom Mr. Magee could not see fell full upon his\nface--the bespectacled wise face of Professor Thaddeus Bolton.\n\n\"Better luck next time,\" said the professor.\n\n\"Keep an eye an him,\" said the voice from inside. \"If he tries to leave\nthe inn there'll be a big row. We must be in on it--and win.\"\n\n\"I imagine,\" said Professor Bolton, smiling his academic smile, \"that\nthe inmates of Baldpate will make to-morrow a rather interesting day for\nhim.\"\n\n\"It will be an interesting day for every one,\" answered the voice.\n\n\"If I should manage to secure the package, by any chance,\" the professor\nwent on, \"I shall undoubtedly need your help in getting away with it.\nLet us arrange a signal. Should a window of my room be open at any time\nto-morrow, you will know the money is in my hands.\"\n\n\"Very good,\" replied the other. \"Good night--and good luck.\"\n\n\"The same to you,\" answered Professor Bolton. The door was closed, and\nthe old man moved off down the passageway.\n\nAfter him crept Mr. Magee. He followed the professor to the east\nbalcony, and saw him pause at the open window of number seven. There the\nold man looked slyly about, as though in doubt. He peered into the room,\nand one foot was across the sill when Mr. Magee came up and touched him\non the arm.\n\nProfessor Bolton leaped in evident fright out upon the balcony.\n\n\"It's--it's a wonderful night,\" he said. \"I was out for a little walk on\nthe balcony, enjoying it. Seeing your open window, I was afraid--\"\n\n\"The night you speak so highly of,\" replied Mr. Magee, \"is at your left.\nYou have lost your way. Good night, Professor.\"\n\nHe stepped inside and closed the window. Then he pulled down the\ncurtains in both rooms of his suite, and spent some time exploring.\nFinally he paused before the fireplace, and with the aid of a knife\nunloosed a brick. Under this he placed the package of money, removing\nthe traces of his act as best he could.\n\n\"Now,\" he said, standing up, \"I'm a regular hermit with a buried\ntreasure, as per all hermit specifications. To-morrow I'm going to hand\nmy treasure to somebody--it's too much for a man who came up here to\nescape the excitement and melodrama of the world.\"\n\nHe looked at his watch. It was past three o'clock. Entering the inner\nroom, for the second time that night he sought to sleep. \"They can't\nplay without me--I've got the ball,\" he repeated with a smile. And, safe\nin this thought, he closed his eyes, and slumbered.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nTHE COLD GRAY DAWN\n\n\nThe gayest knight must have a morning after. Mr. Magee awakened to his\nto find suite seven wrapped again in its favorite polar atmosphere.\nFilling the door leading to the outer room, he beheld the cause of his\nawakening--the mayor of Reuton. Mr. Cargan regarded him with the cold\nsteely eye of a Disraeli in action, but when he spoke he opened the jaws\nof a cocktail mixer.\n\n\"Well, young fellow,\" he remarked, \"it seems to me it was time you got\nup and faced the responsibilities of the day. First of which, I may\nmention, is a little talk with me.\"\n\nHe stepped into the room, and through the doorway he vacated Mr. Max\ncame slinking. The unlovely face of the foe of suspicion was badly\nbruised, and he looked upon the world with no cheerful eye. Pushing\naside one of the frail bedroom chairs as untrustworthy, the mayor sat\ndown on the edge of Mr. Magee's bed. It creaked in protest.\n\n\"You used us pretty rough last night in the snow,\" Cargan went on.\n\"That's why I ain't disposed to go in for kid gloves and diplomacy this\nmorning. It's my experience that when you're dealing with a man who's\ngot the good old Irish name of Magee, it's best to hit first and debate\nafterward.\"\n\n\"I--I used you roughly, Mr. Cargan?\" said Magee.\n\n\"No debate, mind you,\" protested the mayor. \"Lou and me are making this\nmorning call to inquire after a little package that went astray\nsomewhere last night. There's two courses open to you--hand over the\npackage or let us take it. I'll give you a tip--the first is the best.\nIf we have to take it, we might get real rough in our actions.\"\n\nMr. Max slipped closer to the bed, an ugly look on his face. The mayor\nglared fixedly into Magee's eyes. The knight who fought for fair ladies\nin the snow lay on his pillow and considered briefly.\n\n\"I get what I go after,\" remarked Cargan emphatically.\n\n\"Yes,\" sparred Magee, \"but the real point is keeping what you get after\nyou've gone after it. You didn't make much of an impression on me last\nnight in that line, Mr. Cargan.\"\n\n\"I never cared much for humor,\" replied the mayor, \"especially at this\nearly hour of the morning.\"\n\n\"And I hate a fresh guy,\" put in Max, \"like poison.\"\n\n\"I'm not fresh,\" Mr. Magee smiled, \"I'm stating facts. You say you've\ncome for that package. All right--but you've come to the wrong room. I\nhaven't got it.\"\n\n\"The hell you haven't,\" roared the mayor. \"Lou, look about a bit.\"\n\n\"Look about all you like,\" agreed Magee. \"You won't find it. Mr. Cargan,\nI admit that I laid for you last night. I saw you open the safe\naccording to the latest approved methods, and I saw you come forth with\na package of money. But I wasn't rough with you. I might have been, to\nbe frank, but somebody beat me to it.\"\n\n\"Who?\"\n\n\"The man with the seventh key, I suppose. The man Bland heard walking\nabout last night when we were at dinner. Don't tell me you didn't see\nhim in that mix-up at the foot of the steps?\"\n\n\"Well--I did think there was another guy,\" the mayor answered, \"but Lou\nsaid I was crazy.\"\n\n\"Lou does you an injustice. There was another guy, and if you are\nanxious to recover your precious package, I advise you to wake him up to\nthe responsibilities of the day, not me.\"\n\nThe mayor considered. Mr. Max, who had hastily made the rounds of the\nthree rooms, came back with empty hands.\n\n\"Well,\" said the mayor, \"I might as well admit it. I'm up in the air. I\ndon't know just at this minute where to get off. But that state of\naffairs don't last long with me, young fellow. I'll go to the bottom of\nthis before the day is out, believe me. And if I can't do anything else,\nI'll take you back to Reuton myself and throw you in jail for robbery.\"\n\n\"I wouldn't do that,\" smiled Magee. \"Think of the awful job of\nexplaining to the white necktie crowd how you happened to be dynamiting\na safe on Baldpate Mountain at midnight.\"\n\n\"Oh, I guess I can get around that,\" said the mayor. \"That money belongs\nto a friend of mine--Andy Rutter. I happen to go to the inn for a little\nrest, and I grab you dynamiting the safe. I'll keep an eye on you\nto-day, Mr. Magee. And let me tell you now that if I catch you or any of\nthe bunch that's with you trying to make a getaway from Baldpate,\nthere's going to be a war break out.\"\n\n\"I don't know about the other hermits,\" laughed Magee, \"but personally,\nI expect to be here for several weeks to come. Whew! It's cold in here.\nWhere's the hermit? Why hasn't he been up to fix my fire?\"\n\n\"Yes, where is he?\" repeated Mr. Cargan. \"That's what everybody'd like\nto know. He hasn't showed up. Not a sign of breakfast, and me as hollow\nas a reformer's victory.\"\n\n\"He's backslid,\" cried Magee.\n\n\"The quitter,\" sneered Max. \"It's only a quitter would live on the\nmountain in a shack, anyhow.\"\n\n\"You're rather hard on poor old Peters,\" remarked Magee, \"but when I\nthink that I have to get up and dress in a refrigerating plant--I can't\nsay I blame you. If only the fire were lighted--\"\n\nHe smiled his most ingratiating smile on his companion.\n\n\"By the way, Mr. Cargan, you're up and dressed. I've read a lot of\nmagazine articles about you, and they one and all agree that you're a\ngood fellow. You'll find kindling and paper beside the hearth.\"\n\n\"What!\" The mayor's roar seemed to shake the windows. \"Young man, with a\nnerve like yours, you could wheedle the price of a battleship from\nCarnegie. I--I--\" He stood for a moment gazing almost in awe at Magee.\nThen he burst forth into a whole-souled laugh. \"I am a good fellow,\" he\nsaid. \"I'll show you.\"\n\nHe went into the other room, and despite the horrified protests of Lou\nMax, busied himself amid the ashes of the fireplace. When he had a blaze\nunder way, Mr. Magee came shivering from the other room and held out his\nhand.\n\n\"Mr. Cargan,\" he laughed, \"you're a prince.\" He noted with interest that\nthe mayor's broad shoes were mighty near two hundred thousand, dollars.\n\nWhile Mr. Magee drew on his clothes, the mayor and Max sat thoughtfully\nbefore the fire, the former with his pudgy hands folded over the vast\nexpanse where no breakfast reposed. Mr. Magee explained to them that the\nholder of the sixth key had arrived.\n\n\"A handsome young lady,\" he remarked; \"her name is Myra Thornhill.\"\n\n\"Old Henry Thornhill's daughter,\" reflected the mayor. \"Well, seems I've\nsort of lost the habit of being surprised now. I tell you, Lou, we're\nbreaking into the orchid division up here.\"\n\nWhile Mr. Magee shaved--in ice-cold water, another black mark against\nthe Hermit of Baldpate--he turned over in his mind the events of the\nnight before. The vigil in the office, the pleading of the fair girl on\nthe balcony, the battle by the steps, the sudden appearance of Miss\nThornhill, the figure in his room, the conversation by the annex\ndoor--like a moving picture film the story of that weird night unrolled\nitself. The film was not yet at an end. He had given himself the night\nto think. Soon he would stand before the girl of the station; soon he\nmust answer her questions. What was he to do with the fortune that lay\nbeneath the feet of the mayor of Reuton at this minute? He hardly knew.\n\nHe was ready to descend at last, and came into the parlor of his suite\nwith greatcoat and hat. In reply to Mr. Cargan's unasked question, he\nsaid:\n\n\"I'm going up the mountain presently to reason with our striking cook.\"\n\n\"You ain't going to leave this inn, Magee,\" said the mayor.\n\n\"Not even to bring back a cook. Come, Mr. Cargan, be reasonable. You may\ngo with me, if you suspect my motives.\"\n\nThey went out into the hall, and Mr. Magee passed down the corridor to\nthe farther end, where he rapped on the door of Miss Thornhill's room.\nShe appeared almost immediately, buried beneath furs and wraps.\n\n\"You must be nearly frozen,\" remarked Mr. Magee pityingly. \"You and your\nmaid come down to the office. I want you to meet the other guests.\"\n\n\"I'll come,\" she replied. \"Mr. Magee, I've a confession to make. I\ninvented the maid. It seemed so horribly unconventional and shocking--I\ncouldn't admit that I was alone. That was why I wouldn't let you build a\nfire for me.\"\n\n\"Don't worry,\" smiled Magee. \"You'll find we have all the conveniences\nup here. I'll present you to a chaperon shortly--a Mrs. Norton, who is\nhere with her daughter. Allow me to introduce Mr. Cargan and Mr. Max.\"\n\nThe girl bowed with a rather startled air, and Mr. Cargan mumbled\nsomething that had \"pleasure\" in it. In the office they found Professor\nBolton and Mr. Bland sitting gloomily before the fireplace.\n\n\"Got the news, Magee?\" asked the haberdasher. \"Peters has done a\ndisappearing act.\"\n\nIt was evident to Magee that everybody looked upon Peters as his\ncreature, and laid the hermit's sins at his door. He laughed.\n\n\"I'm going to head a search party shortly,\" he said. \"Don't I detect the\nodor of coffee in the distance?\"\n\n\"Mrs. Norton,\" remarked Professor Bolton dolefully, \"has kindly\nconsented to do what she can.\"\n\nThe girl of the station came through the dining-room door. It was\nevident she had no share in the general gloom that the hermit's absence\ncast over Baldpate. Her eyes were bright with the glories of morning on\na mountain; in their depths there was no room for petty annoyances.\n\n\"Good morning,\" she said to Mr. Magee. \"Isn't it bracing? Have you been\noutside? Oh, I--\"\n\n\"Miss Norton--Miss Thornhill,\" explained Magee. \"Miss Thornhill has the\nsixth key, you know. She came last night without any of us knowing.\"\n\nWith lukewarm smiles the two girls shook hands. Outwardly the glances\nthey exchanged were nonchalant and casual, but somehow Mr. Magee felt\nthat among the matters they established were social position, wit,\ncunning, guile, and taste in dress.\n\n\"May I help with the coffee?\" asked Miss Thornhill.\n\n\"Only to drink it,\" replied the girl of the station. \"It's all made now,\nyou see.\"\n\nAs if in proof of this, Mrs. Norton appeared in the dining-room door\nwith a tray, and simultaneously opened an endless monologue:\n\n\"I don't know what you men will say to this, I'm sure--nothing in the\nhouse but some coffee and a few crackers--not even any canned soup, and\nI thought from the way things went yesterday he had ten thousand cans of\nit at the very least--but men are all alike--what name did you say?--oh\nyes, Miss Thornhill, pleased to meet you, I'm sure--excuse my not\nshaking hands--as I was saying, men are all alike--Norton thought if he\nbrought home a roast on Saturday night it ought to last the week out--\"\n\nShe rattled on. Unheeding her flow of talk, the hermits of Baldpate Inn\nswallowed the coffee she offered. When the rather unsatisfactory\nsubstitute for breakfast was consumed, Mr. Magee rose briskly.\n\n\"Now,\" he said, \"I'm going to run up to the hermit's shack and reason\nwith him as best I can. I shall paint in touching colors our sad plight.\nIf the man has an atom of decency--\"\n\n\"A walk on the mountain in the morning,\" said Miss Thornhill quickly.\n\"Splendid. I--\"\n\n\"Wonderful,\" put in Miss Norton. \"I, for one, can't resist. Even though\nI haven't been invited, I'm going along.\" She smiled sweetly. She had\nbeaten the other girl by the breadth of a hair, and she knew it. New\nglories shone in her eyes.\n\n\"Good for you!\" said Magee. The evil hour of explanations was at hand,\nsurely. \"Run up and get your things.\"\n\nWhile Miss Norton was gone, Mr. Cargan and Lou Max engaged in earnest\nconverse near a window. After which Mr. Max pulled on his overcoat.\n\n\"I ain't been invited either,\" he said, \"but I reckon I'll go along. I\nalways wanted to see what a hermit lived like when he's really buckled\ndown to the hermit business. And then a walk in the morning has always\nbeen my first rule for health. You don't mind, do you?\"\n\n\"Who am I,\" asked Magee, \"that I should stand between you and health?\nCome along, by all means.\"\n\nWith the blue corduroy suit again complete, and the saucy hat perched on\nher blond head, Miss Norton ran down the stairs and received the news\nthat Mr. Max also was enthralled by the possibilities of a walk up\nBaldpate. The three went out through the front door, and found under the\nsnow a hint of the path that led to the shack of the post-card merchant.\n\n\"Will you go ahead?\" asked Magee of Max.\n\n\"Sorry,\" grinned Max, \"but I guess I'll bring up the rear.\"\n\n\"Suspicion,\" said Mr. Magee, shaking his head, \"has caused a lot of\ntrouble in the world. Remember the cruelty practised on Pueblo Sam.\"\n\n\"I do,\" replied Mr. Max, \"and it nearly breaks my heart. But there's a\nlittle matter I forgot to mention last night. Suspicion is all right in\nits place.\"\n\n\"Where's that?\" asked Mr. Magee.\n\nMr. Max tapped his narrow chest. \"Here,\" he said. So the three began the\nclimb, Mr. Magee and the girl ahead, Mr. Max leering at their heels.\n\nThe snow still fell, and the picture of the world was painted in grays\nand whites. At some points along the way to the hermit's abode it had\ndrifted deep; at others the foot-path was swept almost bare by the wind.\nFor a time Mr. Max kept so close that the conversation of the two in the\nlead was necessarily of the commonplaces of the wind and sky and\nmountain.\n\nCovertly Mr. Magee glanced at the girl striding along by his side. The\nred flamed in her cheeks; her long lashes were flecked with the white of\nthe snow; her face was such a one as middle-aged men dream of while\ntheir fat wives read the evening paper's beauty hints at their side. Far\nbeyond the ordinary woman was she desirable and pleasing. Mr. Magee told\nhimself he had been a fool. For he who had fought so valiantly for her\nheart's desire at the foot of the steps had faltered when the time came\nto hand her the prize. Why? What place had caution in the wild scheme of\nthe night before? None, surely. And yet he, dolt, idiot, coward, had in\nthe moment of triumph turned cautious. Full confession, he decided, was\nthe only way out.\n\nMr. Max was panting along quite ten feet behind. Over her shoulder the\ngirl noted this; she turned her questioning eyes on Magee; he felt that\nhis moment had come.\n\n\"I don't know how to begin,\" muttered the novelist whose puppets'\nspeeches had always been so apt. \"Last night you sent me on a sort\nof--quest for the golden fleece. I didn't know who had been fleeced, or\nwhat the idea was. But I fared forth, as they say. I got it for you--\"\n\nThe eyes of the girl glowed happily. She was beaming.\n\n\"I'm so glad,\" she said. \"But why--why didn't you give it to me last\nnight? It would have meant so much if you had.\"\n\n\"That,\" replied Mr. Magee, \"is what I'm coming to--very reluctantly. Did\nyou note any spirit of caution in the fellow who set forth on your\nquest, and dropped over the balcony rail? You did not. I waited on the\nporch and saw Max tap the safe. I saw him and Cargan come out. I waited\nfor them. Just as I was about to jump on them, somebody--the man with\nthe seventh key, I guess--did it for me. There was a scuffle. I joined\nit. I emerged with the package everybody seems so interested in.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said the girl breathlessly. \"And then--\"\n\n\"I started to bring it to you,\" went on Magee, glancing over his\nshoulder at Max. \"I was all aglow with romance, and battle, and all that\nsort of thing. I pictured the thrill of handing you the thing you had\nasked. I ran up-stairs. At the head of the stairs--I saw her.\"\n\nThe light died in her eyes. Reproach entered there.\n\n\"Yes,\" continued Magee, \"your knight errant lost his nerve. He ceased to\nrun on schedule. She, too, asked me for that package of money.\"\n\n\"And you gave it to her,\" said the girl scornfully.\n\n\"Oh, no,\" answered Magee quickly. \"Not so bad as that. I simply sat down\non the steps and thought. I got cautious. I decided to wait until\nto-day. I--I did wait.\"\n\nHe paused. The girl strode on, looking straight ahead. Mr. Magee thought\nof adding that he had felt it might be dangerous to place a package so\nvoraciously desired in her frail hands. He decided he'd better not, on\nsecond thought.\n\n\"I know,\" he said, \"what you think. I'm a fine specimen of a man to send\non a hunt like that. A weak-kneed mollycoddle who passes into a state of\ncoma at the crucial moment. But--I'm going to give you that package\nyet.\"\n\nThe girl turned her head. Mr. Magee saw that her eyes were misty with\ntears.\n\n\"You're playing with me,\" she said brokenly. \"I might have known. And I\ntrusted you. You're in the game with the others--and I thought you\nweren't. I staked my whole chance of success on you--now you're making\nsport of me. You never intended to give me that money--you don't intend\nto now.\"\n\n\"On my word,\" cried Magee, \"I do intend to give it to you. The minute we\nget back to the inn. I have it safe in my room.\"\n\n\"Give it to her,\" said the girl bitterly. \"Why don't you give it to\nher?\"\n\nOh, the perversity of women!\n\n\"It's you I want to give it to,\" replied Magee warmly. \"I don't know\nwhat was the matter with me last night. I was a fool. You don't believe\nin me, I know--\" Her face was cold and expressionless.\n\n\"And I wanted to believe in you--so much,\" she said.\n\n\"Why did you want to?\" cried Magee. \"Why?\"\n\nShe plodded on through the snow.\n\n\"You must believe,\" he pleaded. \"I don't know what all this is about--on\nmy word of honor. But I want to give you that money, and I will--the\nminute we get back to the inn. Will you believe then? Will you?\"\n\n\"I hate you,\" said the girl simply.\n\nShe should not have said that. As far back as he could remember, such\nopposition had stirred Mr. Magee to wild deeds. He opened his mouth and\nwords flowed forth. What were the words?\n\n\"I love you! I love you! Ever since that moment in the station I have\nloved you! I love you!\"\n\nFaintly he heard himself saying it over and over. By the gods, he was\nproposing! Inanely, in words of one syllable, as the butcher's boy might\nhave told his love to the second kitchen maid.\n\n\"I love you,\" he continued. Idiot!\n\nOften Mr. Magee had thought of the moment when he would tell his love to\na woman. It was a moment of dim lights, music perhaps in the distance,\ntwo souls caught up in the magic of the moonlit night--a pretty graceful\nspeech from him, a sweet gracious surrender from the girl. And\nthis--instead.\n\n\"I love you.\" In heaven's name, was he never going to stop saying it? \"I\nwant you to believe.\"\n\nBright morning on the mountain, a girl in an angry mood at his side, a\nseedy chaperon on his trail, an erring cook ahead. Good lord! He\nrecalled that a fellow novelist, whose love scenes were regarded as\nmodels by young people suffering the tender passion, had once confessed\nthat he proposed to his wife on a street-car, and was accepted just as\nthe conductor handed him his transfers. Mr. Magee had been scornful. He\ncould never be scornful again. By a tremendous effort he avoided\nrepeating his childish refrain.\n\nThe girl deliberately stopped. There was never less of sweet gracious\nsurrender in a suffragette hurling a stone through a shop-keeper's\nwindow. She eyed Mr. Magee pityingly, and they stood until Mr. Max\ncaught up with them.\n\n\"So that's the hermit's shack,\" said Max, indicating the little wooden\nhut at which they had arrived. \"A funny place for a guy to bury himself.\nI should think he'd get to longing for the white lights and the table\nd'h\u00c3\u00b4tes with red wine.\"\n\n\"A very unromantic speech,\" reproved the girl. \"You should be deeply\nthrilled at the thought of penetrating the secrets of the hermitage. I\nam. Are you, Mr. Magee?\"\n\nShe smiled up at Magee, and he was in that state where he thought that\nin the blue depths of her eyes he saw the sunny slopes of the islands of\nthe blest.\n\n\"I--\" he caught himself in time. He would not be idiot enough to babble\nit again. He pulled himself together. \"I'm going to make you believe in\nme,\" he said, with a touch of his old jauntiness.\n\nMr. Max was knocking with characteristic loudness at the hermit's door.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nA FALSEHOOD UNDER THE PALMS\n\n\n\"Make me a willow cabin at your gate,\" quoted Mr. Magee, looking at the\nhermit's shack with interest.\n\n\"U-m-m,\" replied Miss Norton. Thus beautiful sentiments frequently fare,\neven at the hands of the most beautiful. Mr. Magee abandoned his project\nof completing the speech.\n\nThe door of the hermit's abode opened before Mr. Max's masterful knock,\nand the bearded little man appeared on the threshold. He was clad in a\npurple dressing-gown that suggested some woman had picked it. Surely no\nman could have fallen victim to that riot of color.\n\n\"Come in,\" said the hermit, in a tone so colorless it called added\nattention to the gown. \"Miss, you have the chair. You'll have to be\ncontented with that soap-box davenport, gentlemen. Well?\"\n\nHe stood facing them in the middle of his hermitage. With curious eyes\nthey examined its architecture. Exiled hands had built it of poles and\nclay and a reliable brand of roofing. In the largest room, where they\nsat, were chairs, a table, and a book-shelf hammered together from stray\nboards--furniture midway between that in a hut on a desert isle and that\nof a home made happy from the back pages of a woman's magazine. On the\nwall were various posters that defined the hermit's taste in art as\ninflammatory, bold, arresting. Through one door at the rear they caught\na glimpse of a tiny kitchen; through another the white covering of a\nhall-room cot could be seen.\n\n\"Well?\" repeated Mr. Peters. \"I suppose you're a delegation, so to\nspeak?\"\n\n\"A cold unfeeling word,\" objected Mr. Magee.\n\n\"We have come to plead\"--began Miss Norton, turning her eyes at their\nfull candle-power on the hermit's bearded face.\n\n\"I beg pardon, miss,\" interrupted Mr. Peters, \"but it ain't any use.\nI've thought it all out--in the night watches, as the poet says. I came\nup here to be alone. I can't be a hermit and a cook, too. I can't and be\ntrue to myself. No, you'll have to accept my resignation, to take effect\nat once.\"\n\nHe sat down on an uncertain chair and regarded them sorrowfully. His\nlong well-shaped fingers clutched the cord of the purple gown.\n\n\"It isn't as though we were asking you to give up the hermit business\nfor good,\" argued Magee. \"It's just for a short time--maybe only for a\nfew days. I should think you would welcome the diversion.\"\n\nMr. Peters shook his head vigorously. The brown curls waved flippantly\nabout his shoulders.\n\n\"My instincts,\" he replied, \"are away from the crowd. I explained that\nto you when we first met, Mr. Magee.\"\n\n\"Any man,\" commented Mr. Max, \"ought to be able to strangle his\ninstincts for a good salary, payable in advance.\"\n\n\"You come here,\" said the hermit with annoyance, \"and you bring with you\nthe sentiments of the outside world--the world I have foresworn. Don't\ndo it. I ask you.\"\n\n\"I don't get you,\" reflected Mr. Max. \"No, pal, I don't quite grab this\nhermit game. It ain't human nature, I say. Way up here miles from the\nlittle brass rail and the sporting extra, and other things that make\nlife worth living. It's beyond me.\"\n\n\"I'm not asking your approval,\" replied the hermit. \"All I ask is to be\nlet alone.\"\n\n\"Let me speak,\" said Miss Norton. \"Mr. Peters and I have been friends,\nyou might say, for three years. It was three years ago my awed eyes\nfirst fell upon him, selling his post-cards at the inn. He was to me\nthen--the true romance--the man to whom the world means nothing without\na certain woman at his side. That is what he has meant to all the girls\nwho came to Baldpate. He isn't going to shatter my ideal of him--he\nisn't going to refuse a lady in distress. You will come for just a\nlittle while, won't you, Mr. Peters?\"\n\nBut Peters shook his head again.\n\n\"I dislike women as a sex,\" he said, \"but I've always been gentle and\neasy with isolated examples of 'em. It ain't my style to turn 'em down.\nBut this is asking too much. I'm sorry. But I got to be true to my\noath--I got to be a hermit.\"\n\n\"Maybe,\" sneered Mr. Max, \"he's got good reason for being a hermit.\nMaybe there's brass buttons and blue uniforms mixed up in it.\"\n\n\"You come from the great world of suspicion,\" answered the hermit,\nturning reproving eyes upon him. \"Your talk is natural--it goes with the\nlife you lead. But it isn't true.\"\n\n\"And Mr. Max is the last who should insinuate,\" rebuked Mr. Magee. \"Why,\nonly last night he denounced suspicion, and bemoaned the fact that there\nis so much of it in the world.\"\n\n\"Well he might,\" replied the hermit. \"Suspicion is the key-note of\nmodern life--especially in New York.\" He drew the purple dressing-gown\ncloser about his plump form. \"I remember the last time I was in the big\ntown, seeing a crowd of men in the grill-room of the Hoffman House. One\nof them--long, lean, like an eel--stooped down and whispered in the ear\nof a little fellow with a diamond horseshoe desecrating his\nhaberdashery, and pointing to another man near by. 'No, I won't,' says\nthe man with the diamonds, 'I don't introduce nobody to nobody. Let\nevery man play his own game, I say.' That's New York. That's the essence\nof the town. 'I introduce nobody to nobody.'\"\n\n\"It seems odd,\" remarked Mr. Magee, \"to hear you speak of the time you\nwalked on pavements.\"\n\n\"I haven't always been on Baldpate Mountain,\" replied the hermit. \"Once\nI, too, paid taxes and wore a derby hat and sat in barbers' chairs. Yes,\nI sat in 'em in many towns, in many corners of this little round globe.\nBut that's all over now.\"\n\nThe three visitors gazed at Mr. Peters with a new interest.\n\n\"New York,\" said Mr. Max softly, as a better man might have spoken the\nname of the girl he loved. \"Its a great little Christmas tree. The\ncandles are always burning and the tinsel presents always look good to\nme.\"\n\nThe hermit's eyes strayed far away--down the mountain--and beyond.\n\n\"New York,\" said he, and his tone was that in which Max had said the\nwords. \"A great little Christmas tree it is, with fine presents for the\nreaching. Sometimes, at night here, I see it as it was four years ago--I\nsee the candles lit on the Great White Way--I hear the elevated roar,\nand the newsboys shout, and Diamond Jim Brady applauding at a musical\ncomedy's first night. New York!\"\n\nMr. Max rose pompously and pointed a yellow finger at the Hermit of\nBaldpate Mountain.\n\n\"I got you!\" he cried in triumph. \"I'm wise! You want to go back.\"\n\nA half-hearted smile crossed the visible portion of the hermit's face.\n\n\"I guess I'm about the poorest liar in the world,\" he said. \"I never got\naway with but one lie in my life, and that was only for a little while.\nIt was a masterpiece while it lasted, too. But it was my only hit as a\nliar. Usually I fail, as I have failed now. I lied when I said I\ncouldn't cook for you because I had to be true to my hermit's oath. That\nisn't the reason. I'm afraid.\"\n\n\"Afraid?\" echoed Mr. Magee.\n\n\"Scared,\" said Mr. Peters, \"of temptation. Your seventh son of a seventh\nson friend here has read my palm O. K. I want to go back. Not in the\nsummer, when the inn blazes like Broadway every evening, and I can sit\nhere and listen to the latest comic opera tunes come drifting up from\nthe casino, and go down and mingle with the muslin brigade any time I\nwant, and see the sympathetic look in their eyes as they buy my postals.\nIt ain't then I want to go back. It's when fall comes, and the trees on\nthe mountain are bare, and Quimby locks up the inn, and there's only the\nwind and me on the mountain--then I get the fever. I haven't the\npost-card trade to think of--so I think of Ellen, and New York.\nShe's--my wife. New York--it's my town.\n\n\"That's why I can't come among you to cook. It'd be leading me into\ntemptation greater than I could stand. I'd hear your talk, and like as\nnot when you went away I'd shave off this beard, and burn the manuscript\nof _Woman_, and go down into the marts of trade. Last night I walked the\nfloor till two. I can't stand such temptation.\"\n\nMr. Peters' auditors regarded him in silence. He rose and moved toward\nthe kitchen door.\n\n\"Now you understand how it is,\" he said. \"Perhaps you will go and leave\nme to my baking.\"\n\n\"One minute,\" objected Mr. Magee. \"You spoke of one lie--your\nmasterpiece. We must hear about that.\"\n\n\"Yes--spin the yarn, pal,\" requested Mr. Max.\n\n\"Well,\" said the hermit reluctantly, \"if you're quite comfortable--it\nain't very short.\"\n\n\"Please,\" beamed Miss Norton.\n\nWith a sigh the Hermit of Baldpate Mountain sank upon a most unsocial\nseat and drew his purple splendor close.\n\n\"It was like this,\" he began. \"Five years ago I worked for a fruit\ncompany, and business sent me sliding along the edges of strange seas\nand picture-book lands. I met little brown men, and listened to the soft\nswish of the banana growing, and had an orchestra seat at a revolution\nor two. Don't look for a magazine story about overthrown tyrants, or\nanything like that. It's just a quiet little lie I'm speaking of, told\non a quiet little afternoon, by the sands of a sea as blue as Baldpate\nInn must have been this morning when I didn't show up with breakfast.\n\n\"Sitting on those yellow sands the afternoon I speak of, wearing carpet\nslippers made for me by loving, so to speak, hands, I saw Alexander\nMcMann come along. He was tall and straight and young and free, and I\nenvied him, for even in those days my figure would never have done in a\nclothing advertisement, owing to the heritage of too many table d'h\u00c3\u00b4tes\nabout the middle. Well, McMann sat at my side, and little by little,\nwith the sea washing sad-like near by, I got from him the story of his\nexile, and why.\n\n\"I don't need to tell you it was woman had sent him off for the equator.\nThis one's name was Marie, I think, and she worked at a lunch-counter in\nKansas City. From the young man's bill-of-fare description of her, I\ngathered that she had cheeks like peaches and cream, but a heart like a\nlunch-counter doughnut, which is hard.\n\n\"'She cast you off?' I asked.\n\n\"'She threw me down,' said he.\n\n\"Well, it seems he'd bought a ticket for that loud-colored country where\nI met him, and come down there to forget. 'I could buy the ticket,' he\nsaid, 'as soon as I learned how to pronounce the name of this town. But\nI can't forget. I've tried. It's hopeless.' And he sat there looking\nlike a man whose best friend has died, owing him money. I won't go into\nhis emotions. Mr. Bland, up at the inn, is suffering them at the present\nmoment, I'm told. They're unimportant; I'll hurry on to the lie. I\nsimply say he was sorrowful, and it seemed to me a crime, what with the\nsun so bright, and the sea so blue, and the world so full of a number of\nthings. Yes, it certainly was a crime, and I decided he had to be\ncheered up at any cost. How? I thought a while, gazing up at the sky,\nand then it came to me--the lie--the great glorious lie--and I told it.\"\n\nThe hermit looked in defiance round the listening circle.\n\n\"'You're chuck full of sorrow now,' I said to McMann, 'but it won't last\nlong.' He shook his head. 'Nonsense,' I told him. 'Look at me. Do you\nsee me doing a heart-bowed-down act under the palms? Do you find\nanything but joy in my face?' And he couldn't, the lie unfolding itself\nin such splendor to me. 'You?' he asked. 'Me,' I said. 'Ten years ago I\nwas where you are to-day. A woman had spoken to me as Mabel--or\nMarie--or what was it?--spoke to you.'\n\n\"I could see I had the boy interested. I unfolded my story, as it\noccurred to me at the moment. 'Yes,' said I, 'ten years ago I saw her\nfirst. Dancing as a butterfly dances from flower to flower. Dancing on\nthe stage--a fairy sprite. I loved her--worshiped her. It could never\nbe. There in the dark of the wings, she told me so. And she shed a\ntear--a sweet tear of sorrow at parting.\n\n\"'I went to my room,' I told McMann, 'with a lot of time-tables and\nsteamship books. Bright red books--the color came off on my eager hands.\nI picked out a country, and sailed away. Like you, I thought I could\nnever be happy, never even smile, again. Look at me.'\n\n\"He looked. I guess my face radiated bliss. The idea was so lovely. He\nwas impressed--I could see it. 'I'm supremely happy,' I told him. 'I am\nmy own master. I wander where I will. No woman tells me my hour for\ngoing out, or my hour for coming in. I wander. For company I have her\npicture--as I saw her last--with twinkling feet that never touched\nearth. As the spirit moves, I go. You can move the memory of a woman in\na flash, my boy, but it takes two months to get the real article\nstarted, and then like as not she's forgot everything of importance.\nEver thought of that? You should. You're going to be as happy as I am.\nStudy me. Reflect.' I waved my carpet-slippered feet toward the palms. I\nhad certainly made an impression on Alexander McMann.\n\n\"As we walked back over the sands and grass-grown streets to the hotel,\nhis heart got away from that cupid's lunch-counter, and he was almost\ncheerful. I was gay to the last, but as I parted from him my own heart\nsank. I knew I had to go back to her, and that she would probably give\nme a scolding about the carpet slippers. I parted from McMann with a\nlast word of cheer. Then I went to the ship--to her. My wife. That was\nthe lie, you understand. She traveled everywhere with me. She never\ntrusted me.\n\n\"We were due to sail that night, and I was glad. For I worried some over\nwhat I had done. Suppose my wife and Alexander McMann should meet. An\nestimable woman, but large, determined, little suggesting the butterfly\nof the footlights I married, long before. We had a bad session over the\ncarpet slippers. The boat was ready to sail, when McMann came aboard. He\ncarried a bag, and his face shone.\n\n\"'She's sent for me,' he said. 'Marie wants me. I got a letter from my\nbrother. I'll blow into Kansas like a cyclone, and claim her.'\n\n\"I was paralyzed. At that minute a large black figure appeared on deck.\nIt headed for me. 'Jake,' it says, 'you've sat up long enough. Go below\nnow.'\n\n\"McMann's face was terrible. I saw it was all up. 'I lied, McMann,' I\nexplained. 'The idea just came to me, it fascinated me, and I lied. She\ndid turn me down--there in the wings. And she shed that tear I spoke of,\ntoo. But, when I was looking over the railroad folders, she sent for me.\nI went--on the wings of love. It was two blocks--but I went on the wings\nof love. We've been married twenty years. Forgive me, McMann!'\n\n\"McMann turned around. He picked up the bag. I asked where he was going.\n'Ashore,' he said, 'to think. I may go back to Kansas City--I may. But\nI'll just think a bit first.' And he climbed into the ship's boat. I\nnever saw him again.\"\n\nThe hermit paused, and gazed dreamily into space.\n\n\"That,\" he said, \"was my one great lie, my masterpiece. A year afterward\nI came up here on the mountain to be a hermit.\"\n\n\"As a result of it?\" asked Miss Norton.\n\n\"Yes,\" answered Mr. Peters, \"I told the story to a friend. I thought he\nwas a friend--so he was, but married. My wife got to hear of it. 'So you\ndenied my existence,' she said. 'As a joke,' I told her. 'The joke's on\nyou,' she says. That was the end. She went her way, and I went mine. I'd\njust unanimously gone her way so long, I was a little dazed at first\nwith my freedom. After fighting for a living alone for a time, I came up\nhere. It's cheap. I get the solitude I need for my book. Not long ago I\nheard I could go back to her if I apologized.\"\n\n\"Stick to your guns,\" advised Mr. Max.\n\n\"I'm trying to,\" Mr. Peters replied. \"But it's lonesome here--in winter.\nAnd at Christmas in particular. This dressing-gown was a Christmas\npresent from Ellen. She picked it. Pretty, ain't it? You see why I can't\ncome down and cook for you. I might get the fever for society, and\nshave, and go to Brooklyn, where she's living with her sister.\"\n\n\"But,\" said Mr. Magee, \"we're in an awful fix. You've put us there. Mr.\nPeters, as a man of honor, I appeal to you. Your sense of fairness must\ntell you my appeal is just. Risk it one more day, and I'll have a cook\nsent up from the village. Just one day. There's no danger in that.\nSurely you can resist temptation one little day. A man of your\ncharacter.\"\n\nMiss Norton rose and stood before Mr. Peters. She fixed him with her\neyes--eyes into which no man could gaze and go his way unmoved.\n\n\"Just one tiny day,\" she pleaded.\n\nMr. Peters sighed. He rose.\n\n\"I'm a fool,\" he said. \"I can't help it. I'll take chances on another\nday. Though nobody knows where it'll lead.\"\n\n\"Brooklyn, maybe,\" whispered Lou Max to Magee in mock horror.\n\nThe hermit donned his coat, attended to a few household duties, and led\nthe delegation outside. Dolefully he locked the door of his shack. The\nfour started down the mountain.\n\n\"Back to Baldpate with our cook,\" said Mr. Magee into the girl's ear. \"I\nknow now how C\u00c3\u00a6sar felt when he rode through Rome with his ex-foes\nfestooned about his chariot wheels.\"\n\nMr. Max again chose the rear, triumphantly escorting Mr. Peters. As Mr.\nMagee and the girl swung into the lead, the former was moved to recur to\nthe topic he had handled so amateurishly a short time before.\n\n\"I'll make you believe in me yet,\" he said.\n\nShe did not turn her head.\n\n\"The moment we reach the inn,\" he went on \"I shall come to you, with the\npackage of money in my hand. Then you'll believe I want to help\nyou--tell me you'll believe then.\"\n\n\"Very likely I shall,\" answered the girl without interest. \"If you\nreally do intend to give me that money--no one must know about it.\"\n\n\"No one shall know,\" he answered, \"but you and me.\"\n\nThey walked on in silence. Then shyly the girl turned her head. Oh, most\nassuredly, she was desirable. Clumsy as had been his declaration, Mr.\nMagee resolved to stick to it through eternity.\n\n\"I'm sorry I spoke as I did,\" she said. \"Will you forgive me?\"\n\n\"Forgive you?\" he cried. \"Why, I--\"\n\n\"And now,\" she interrupted, \"let us talk of other things. Of ships, and\nshoes, and sealing-wax--\"\n\n\"All the topics in the world,\" he replied, \"can lead to but one with\nme--\"\n\n\"Ships?\" asked the girl.\n\n\"For honeymoons,\" he suggested.\n\n\"Shoes?\"\n\n\"In some circles of society, I believe they are flung at bridal\nparties.\"\n\n\"And sealing-wax?\"\n\n\"On the license, isn't it?\" he queried.\n\n\"I'll not try you on cabbage and kings,\" laughed the girl. \"Please, oh,\nplease, don't fail me. You won't, will you?\" Her face was serious. \"You\nsee, it means so very much to me.\"\n\n\"Fail you?\" cried Magee. \"I'd hardly do that now. In ten minutes that\npackage will be in your hands--along with my fate, my lady.\"\n\n\"I shall be so relieved.\" She turned her face away, there was a faint\nflush in the cheek toward Mr. Magee. \"And--happy,\" she whispered under\nher breath.\n\nThey were then at the great front door of Baldpate Inn.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nWOE IN NUMBER SEVEN\n\n\nInside, before the office fire, Miss Thornhill read a magazine in the\nindolent fashion so much affected at Baldpate Inn during the heated\nterm; while the mayor of Reuton chatted amiably with the ponderously coy\nMrs. Norton. Into this circle burst the envoys to the hermitage,\nflushed, energetic, snowflaked.\n\n\"Hail to the chef who in triumph advances!\" cried Mr. Magee.\n\nHe pointed to the door, through which Mr. Max was leading the captured\nMr. Peters.\n\n\"You got him, didyu?\" rasped Mrs. Norton.\n\n\"Without the use of anesthetics,\" answered Magee. \"Everybody ready for\none of Mr. Peters' inimitable lunches?\"\n\n\"Put me down at the head of the list,\" contributed the mayor.\n\nMyra Thornhill laid down her magazine, and fixed her great black eyes\nupon the radiant girl in corduroy.\n\n\"And was the walk in the morning air,\" she asked, \"all you expected?\"\n\n\"All, and much more,\" laughed Miss Norton, mischievously regarding the\nman who had babbled to her of love on the mountain. \"By the way, enjoy\nMr. Peters while you can. He's back for just one day.\"\n\n\"Eat, drink, and be merry, for to-morrow the cook leaves, as the fellow\nsays,\" supplemented Mr. Max, removing his overcoat.\n\n\"How about a quick lunch, Peters?\" inquired Magee.\n\n\"Out of what, I'd like to know,\" put in Mrs. Norton. \"Not a thing in the\nhouse to eat. Just like a man.\"\n\n\"You didn't look in the right place, ma'am,\" replied Mr. Peters with\nrelish. \"I got supplies for a couple of days in the kitchen.\"\n\n\"Well, what's the sense in hiding 'em?\" the large lady inquired.\n\n\"It ain't hiding--it's system,\" explained Mr. Peters. \"Something women\ndon't understand.\" He came close to Mr. Magee, and whispered low: \"You\ndidn't warn me there was another of 'em.\"\n\n\"The last, on my word of honor,\" Magee told him.\n\n\"The last,\" sneered Mr. Peters. \"There isn't any last up here.\" And with\na sidelong glance at the new Eve in his mountain Eden, he turned away to\nthe kitchen.\n\n\"Now,\" whispered Magee to Miss Norton, \"I'll get you that package. I'll\nprove that it was for you I fought and bled the mayor of Reuton. Watch\nfor our chance--when I see you again I'll have it in my pocket.\"\n\n\"You mustn't fail me,\" she replied. \"It means so much.\"\n\nMr. Magee started for the stairs. Between him and them loomed suddenly\nthe great bulk of Mr. Cargan. His hard menacing eyes looked full into\nMagee's.\n\n\"I want to speak to you, young fellow,\" he remarked.\n\n\"I'm flattered,\" said Magee, \"that you find my company so enchanting. In\nten minutes I'll be ready for another interview.\"\n\n\"You're ready now,\" answered the mayor, \"even if you don't know it.\" His\ntone was that of one correcting a child. He took Mr. Magee's arm in a\ngrip which recalled to that gentleman a fact the muckraking stories\nalways dwelt on--how this Cargan had, in the old days, \"put away his\nman\" in many shady corners of a great city.\n\n\"Come over here,\" said Cargan. He led the way to a window. Over his\nshoulder Magee noted the troubled eyes of Miss Norton following. \"Sit\ndown. I've been trying to dope you out, and I think I've got you. I've\nseen your kind before. Every few months one of 'em breezes into Reuton,\nspends a whole day talking to a few rats I've had to exterminate from\npolitics, and then flies back to New York with a ten-page story of my\nvicious career all ready for the linotypers. Yes, sir--I got you. You\nwrite sweet things for the magazines.\"\n\n\"Think so?\" inquired Magee.\n\n\"Know it,\" returned the mayor heartily. \"So you're out after old Jim\nCargan's scalp again, are you? I thought that now, seeing stories on the\ncorruption of the courts is so plentiful, you'd let the shame of the\ncity halls alone for a while. But--well, I guess I'm what you guys call\ngood copy. Big, brutal, uneducated, picturesque--you see I read them\nstories myself. How long will the American public stand being ruled by a\nman like this, when it might be authorizing pretty boys with kid gloves\nto get next to the good things? That's the dope, ain't it--the old dope\nof the reform gang--the ballyhoo of the bunch that can't let the\nexisting order stand? Don't worry, I ain't going to get started on that\nagain. But I want to talk to you serious--like a father. There was a\nyoung fellow like you once--\"\n\n\"Like me?\"\n\n\"Exactly. He was out working on long hours and short pay for the reform\ngang, and he happened to get hold of something that a man I knew--a man\nhigh up in public office--wanted, and wanted bad. The young fellow was\ngoing to get two hundred dollars for the article he was writing. My\nfriend offered him twenty thousand to call it off. What'd the young\nfellow do?\"\n\n\"Wrote the article, of course,\" said Magee.\n\n\"Now--now,\" reproved Cargan. \"That remark don't fit in with the estimate\nI've made of you. I think you're a smart boy. Don't disappoint me. This\nyoung fellow I speak of--he was smart, all right. He thought the matter\nover. He knew the reform bunch, through and through. All glory and no\npay, serving them. He knew how they chased bubbles, and made a lot of\nnoise, and never got anywhere in the end. He thought it over, Magee, the\nsame as you're going to do. 'You're on,' says this lad, and added five\nfigures to his roll as easy as we'd add a nickel. He had brains, that\nguy.\"\n\n\"And no conscience,\" commented Magee.\n\n\"Conscience,\" said Mr. Cargan, \"ain't worth much except as an excuse for\na man that hasn't made good to give his wife. How much did you say you\nwas going to get for this article?\"\n\nMr. Magee looked him coolly in the eye.\n\n\"If it's ever written,\" he said, \"it will be a\ntwo-hundred-thousand-dollar story.\"\n\n\"There ain't anything like that in it for you,\" replied the mayor.\n\"Think over what I've told you.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid,\" smiled Magee, \"I'm too busy to think.\"\n\nHe again crossed the office floor to the stairway. Before the fire sat\nthe girl of the station, her big eyes upon him, pleadingly. With a\nreassuring smile in her direction, he darted up the stairs.\n\n\"And now,\" he thought, as he closed and locked the door of number seven\nbehind him, \"for the swag. So Cargan would give twenty thousand for that\nlittle package. I don't blame him.\"\n\nHe opened a window and glanced out along the balcony. It was deserted in\neither direction; its snowy floor was innocent of footprints.\nRe-entering number seven, he knelt by the fireplace and dug up the brick\nunder which lay the package so dear to many hearts on Baldpate Mountain.\n\n\"I might have known,\" he muttered.\n\nFor the money was gone. He dug up several of the bricks, and rummaged\nabout beneath them. No use. The fat little bundle of bills had flown.\nOnly an ugly hole gaped up at him.\n\nHe sat down. Of course! What a fool he had been to suppose that such\ntreasure as this would stay long in a hiding-place so obvious. He who\nhad made a luxurious living writing tales of the chase of gems and plate\nand gold had bungled the thing from the first. He could hammer out on a\ntypewriter wild plots and counter-plots--with a boarding-school girl's\ncupid busy all over the place. But he could not live them.\n\nA boarding-school cupid! Good lord! He remembered the eyes of the girl\nin blue corduroy as they had met his when he turned to the stairs. What\nwould she say now? On this he had gaily staked her faith in him. This\nwas to be the test of his sincerity, the proof of his devotion. And now\nhe must go to her, looking like a fool once more--go to her and confess\nthat again he had failed her.\n\nHis rage blazed forth. So they had \"got to him\", after all. Who? He\nthought of the smooth crafty mountain of a man who had detained him a\nmoment ago. Who but Cargan and Max, of course? They had found his\nchildish hiding-place, and the money had come home to their eager hands.\nNo doubt they were laughing slyly at him now.\n\nWell, he would show them yet. He got up and walked the floor. Once he\nhad held them up in the snow and spoiled their little game--he would do\nit again. How? When? He did not know. His soul cried for action of some\nsort, but he was up against a blind alley, and he knew it.\n\nHe unlocked the door of number seven. To go down-stairs, to meet the\nsweet eagerness of the girl who depended on him, to confess himself\ntricked--it took all the courage he had. Why had it all happened,\nanyhow? Confound it, hadn't he come up here to be alone with his\nthoughts? But, brighter side, it had given him her--or it would give him\nher before the last card was played. He shut his teeth tightly, and went\ndown the stairs.\n\nMr. Bland had added himself to the group about the fire. Quickly the\neyes of Miss Norton met Magee's. She was trembling with excitement.\nCargan, huge, red, cheery, got in Magee's path once more.\n\n\"I'll annihilate this man,\" thought Magee.\n\n\"I've been figuring,\" said the mayor, \"that was one thing he didn't have\nto contend with. No, sir, there wasn't any bright young men hunting up\nold Napoleon and knocking him in the monthly magazines. They didn't go\ndown to Sardinia and pump it out of the neighbors that he started\nbusiness on borrowed money, and that his father drank more than was good\nfor him. They didn't run illustrated articles about the diamonds he\nwore, and moving pictures of him eating soup.\"\n\n\"No, I guess not,\" replied Magee abstractedly.\n\n\"I reckon there was a lot in _his_ record wasn't meant for the\nnewspapers,\" continued Cargan reflectively. \"And it didn't get there.\nNap was lucky. He had it on the reformers there. They couldn't squash\nhim with the power of the press.\"\n\nMr. Magee broke away from the mayor's rehashed history, and hurried to\nMiss Norton.\n\n\"You promised yesterday,\" he reminded her, \"to show me the pictures of\nthe admiral.\"\n\n\"So I did,\" she replied, rising quickly. \"To think you have spent all\nthis time in Baldpate Inn and not paid homage to its own particular cock\nof the walk.\"\n\nShe led him to a portrait hanging beside the desk.\n\n\"Behold,\" she said, \"the admiral on a sunny day in July. Note the\nstarchy grandeur of him, even with the thermometer up in the clouds.\nThat's one of the things the rocking-chair fleet adores in him. Can you\nimagine the flurry at the approach of all that superiority? Theodore\nRoosevelt, William Faversham, and Richard Harding Davis all arriving\ntogether couldn't overshadow the admiral for a minute.\"\n\nMr. Magee gazed at the picture of a pompous little man, whose fierce\nmustache seemed anxious to make up for the lack of hair on his head.\n\n\"A bald hero at a summer resort,\" he commented, \"it seems incredible.\"\n\n\"Oh, they think he lost his hair fighting for the flag,\" she laughed.\n\"It's winter, and snowing, or I shouldn't dare _l\u00c3\u00a8se-majest\u00c3\u00a9_. And--over\nhere--is the admiral on the veranda, playing it's a quarter deck. And\nhere the great portrait--Andrew Rutter with a profaning arm over the\nadmiral's shoulder. The old ladies make their complaints to Mr. Rutter\nin softer tones after seeing that picture.\"\n\n\"And this?\" asked Magee, moving farther from the group by the fire.\n\n\"A precious one--I wonder they leave it here in winter. This is the\nadmiral as a young man--clipped from a magazine article. Even without\nthe mustache, you see, he had a certain martial bearing.\"\n\n\"And now he's the ruler of the queen's navee,\" smiled Magee. He looked\nabout. \"Is it possible to see the room where the admiral plays his\nfamous game?\"\n\n\"Step softly,\" she answered. \"In here. There stands the very table.\"\n\nThey went into the small card-room at the right of the entrance to the\noffice, and Mr. Magee quietly closed the door behind them. The time had\ncome. He felt his heart sink.\n\n\"Well?\" said the girl, with an eagerness she could not conceal.\n\nMr. Magee groped for words. And found--his old friends of the mountain.\n\n\"I love you,\" he cried desperately. \"You must believe I want to help\nyou. It looks rather the other way now, I'll admit. I want you to have\nthat money. I don't know who you are, nor what this all means, but I\nwant you to have it. I went up-stairs determined to give it to you--\"\n\n\"Really.\" The word was at least fifty degrees below the temperature of\nthe card-room.\n\n\"Yes, really. I won't ask you to believe--but I'm telling the truth. I\nwent to the place where I had fatuously hid the money--under a brick of\nmy fireplace. It was gone.\"\n\n\"How terribly unfortunate.\"\n\n\"Yes, isn't it?\" Mr. Magee rejoiced that she took so calm a view of it.\n\"They searched the room, of course. And they found the money. They're on\ntop now. But I'm going--\"\n\nHe stopped. For he had seen her face. She--taking a calm view of it? No,\nindeed. Billy Magee saw that she was furiously, wildly angry. He\nremembered always having written it down that beautiful women were even\nmore beautiful in anger. How, he wondered, had he fallen into that\nerror?\n\n\"Please do not bore me,\" she said through her teeth, \"with any further\nrecital of what you 'are going' to do. You seem to have a fatal facility\nin that line. Your record of accomplishment is pathetically weak.\nAnd--oh, what a fool I've been! I believed. Even after last night, I\nbelieved.\"\n\nNo, she was not going to cry. Hers was no mood for tears. What said the\nlibrettist? \"There is beauty in the roaring of the gale, and the tiger\nwhen a-lashing of his tail.\" Such was the beauty of a woman in anger.\nAnd nothing to get enthusiastic about, thought Mr. Magee.\n\n\"I know,\" he said helplessly, \"you're terribly disappointed. And I don't\nblame you. But you will find out that you've done me an injustice. I'm\ngoing--\"\n\n\"One thing,\" said she, smiling a smile that could have cut glass, \"you\nare going to do. I know that you won't fail this time, because I shall\npersonally see you through with it. You're going to stop making a fool\nof me.\"\n\n\"Tell me,\" pleaded Billy Magee. \"Tell me who you are--what this is all\nabout. Can't you see I'm working in the dark? You must--\"\n\nShe threw open the card-room door.\n\n\"An English officer,\" she remarked loudly, stepping out into the other\nroom, \"taught the admiral the game. At least, so he said. It added so\nmuch romance to it in the eyes of the rocking-chair fleet. Can't you\nsee--India--the hot sun--the Kipling local color--a silent, tanned,\nhandsome man eternally playing solitaire on the porch of the barracks?\nHas the barracks a porch?\"\n\nRoused, humiliated, baffled, Mr. Magee felt his cheeks burn.\n\n\"We shall see what we shall see,\" he muttered.\n\n\"Why coin the inevitable into a bromide,\" she asked.\n\nMr. Magee joined the group by the fire. Never before in his life had he\nbeen so determined on anything as he was now that the package of money\nshould return to his keeping. But how? How trace through this maze of\nhumans the present holder of that precious bundle of collateral? He\nlooked at Mr. Max, sneering his lemon-colored sneer at the mayor's side;\nat the mayor himself, nonchalant as the admiral being photographed; at\nBland, author of the Arabella fiction, sprawling at ease before the\nfire; at the tawdry Mrs. Norton, and at Myra Thornhill, who had by her\npleading the night before made him ridiculous. Who of these had the\nmoney now? Who but Cargan and Max, their faces serene, their eyes\neagerly on the preparations for lunch, their plans for leaving Baldpate\nInn no doubt already made?\n\nAnd then Mr. Magee saw coming down the stairs another figure--one he had\nforgot--Professor Thaddeus Bolton, he of the mysterious dialogue by the\nannex door. On the professor's forehead was a surprising red scratch,\nand his eyes, no longer hidden by the double convex lenses, stood\nrevealed a washed-out gray in the light of noon.\n\n\"A most unfortunate accident,\" explained the old man. \"Most distressing.\nI have broken my glasses. I am almost blind without them.\"\n\n\"How'd it happen, Doc?\" asked Mr. Cargan easily.\n\n\"I came into unexpected juxtaposition with an open door,\" returned\nProfessor Bolton. \"Stupid of me, but I'm always doing it. Really, the\nagility displayed by doors in getting in my path is surprising.\"\n\n\"You and Mr. Max can sympathize with each other,\" said Magee, \"I thought\nfor a moment your injuries might have been received in the same cause.\"\n\n\"Don't worry, Doc,\" Mr. Bland soothed him, \"we'll all keep a weather eye\nout for reporters that want to connect you up with the peroxide\nblondes.\"\n\nThe professor turned his ineffectual gaze on the haberdasher, and there\nwas a startlingly ironic smile on his face.\n\n\"I know, Mr. Bland,\" he said, \"that my safety is your dearest wish.\"\n\nThe Hermit of Baldpate announced that lunch was ready, and with the\nothers Mr. Magee took his place at the table. Food for thought was also\nhis. The spectacles of Professor Thaddeus Bolton were broken. Somewhere\nin the scheme of things those smashed lenses must fit. But where?\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\nTHE EXQUISITE MR. HAYDEN\n\n\nIt was past three o'clock. The early twilight crept up the mountain, and\nthe shadows began to lengthen in the great bare office of Baldpate Inn.\nIn the red flicker of firelight Mr. Magee sat and pondered; the interval\nsince luncheon had passed lazily; he was no nearer to guessing which of\nBaldpate Inn's winter guests hugged close the precious package.\nExasperated, angry, he waited for he knew not what, restless all the\nwhile to act, but having not the glimmer of an inspiration as to what\nhis course ought to be.\n\nHe heard the rustle of skirts on the stair landing, and looked up. Down\nthe broad stairway, so well designed to serve as a show-window for the\nsartorial triumphs of Baldpate's gay summer people, came the tall\nhandsome girl who had the night before set all his plans awry. In the\nswift-moving atmosphere of the inn she had hitherto been to Mr. Magee\nbut a puppet of the shadows, a figure more fictitious than real. Now for\nthe first time he looked upon her as a flesh-and-blood girl, noted the\nred in her olive cheeks, the fire in her dark eyes, and realized that\nher interest in that package of money might be something more than\nanother queer quirk in the tangle of events.\n\nShe smiled a friendly smile at Magee, and took the chair he offered. One\nsmall slipper beat a discreet tattoo on the polished floor of Baldpate's\noffice. Again she suggested to Billy Magee a house of wealth and warmth\nand luxury, a house where Arnold Bennett and the post-impressionists are\noften discussed, a house the head of which becomes purple and apoplectic\nat the mention of Colonel Roosevelt's name.\n\n\"Last night, Mr. Magee,\" she said, \"I told you frankly why I had come to\nBaldpate Inn. You were good enough to say that you would help me if you\ncould. The time has come when you can, I think.\"\n\n\"Yes?\" answered Magee. His heart sank. What now?\n\n\"I must confess that I spied this morning,\" she went on. \"It was rude of\nme, perhaps. But I think almost anything is excusable under the\ncircumstances, don't you? I witnessed a scene in the hall above--Mr.\nMagee, I know who has the two hundred thousand dollars!\"\n\n\"You know?\" cried Magee. His heart gave a great bound. At last! And\nthen--he stopped. \"I'm afraid I must ask you not to tell me,\" he added\nsadly.\n\nThe girl looked at him in wonder. She was of a type common in Magee's\nworld--delicate, finely-reared, sensitive. True, in her pride and\nhaughtiness she suggested the snow-capped heights of the eternal hills.\nBut at sight of those feminine heights Billy Magee had always been one\nto seize his alpenstock in a more determined grip, and climb. Witness\nhis attentions to the supurb Helen Faulkner. He had a moment of\nfaltering. Here was a girl who at least did not doubt him, who ascribed\nto him the virtues of a gentleman, who was glad to trust in him. Should\nhe transfer his allegiance? No, he could hardly do that now.\n\n\"You ask me not to tell you,\" repeated the girl slowly.\n\n\"That demands an explanation,\" replied Billy Magee. \"I want you to\nunderstand--to be certain that I would delight to help you if I could.\nBut the fact is that before you came I gave my word to secure the\npackage you speak of for--another woman. I can not break my promise to\nher.\"\n\n\"I see,\" she answered. Her tone was cool.\n\n\"I'm very sorry,\" Magee went on. \"But as a matter of fact, I seem to be\nof very little service to any one. Just now I would give a great deal to\nhave the information you were about to give me. But since I could not\nuse it helping you, you will readily see that I must not listen. I'm\nsorry.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, too,\" replied the girl. \"Thank you very much--for telling\nme. Now I must--go forward--alone.\" She smiled unhappily.\n\n\"I'm afraid you must,\" answered Billy Magee.\n\nOn the stairs appeared the slim figure of the other girl. Her great eyes\nwere wistful, her face was pale. She came toward them through the red\nfirelight. Mr. Magee saw what a fool he had been to waver in his\nallegiance even for a moment. For he loved her, wanted her, surely. The\nsnow-capped heights are inspiring, but far more companionable is the\nbrook that sparkles in the valley.\n\n\"It's rather dull, isn't it?\" asked Miss Norton of the Thornhill girl.\nBy the side of the taller woman she seemed slight, almost childish.\n\"Have you seen the pictures of the admiral, Miss Thornhill? Looking at\nthem is our one diversion.\"\n\n\"I do not care to see them, thank you,\" Myra Thornhill replied, moving\ntoward the stairs. \"He is a very dear friend of my father.\" She passed\nup and out of sight.\n\nMiss Norton turned away from the fire, and Mr. Magee rose hastily to\nfollow. He stood close behind her, gazing down at her golden hair\nshimmering in the dark.\n\n\"I've just been thinking,\" he said lightly, \"what an absolutely\nridiculous figure I must be in your eyes, buzzing round and round like a\nbee in a bottle, and getting nowhere at all. Listen--no one has left the\ninn. While they stay, there's hope. Am I not to have one more chance--a\nchance to prove to you how much I care?\"\n\nShe turned, and even in the dusk he saw that her eyes were wet.\n\n\"Oh, I don't know, I don't know,\" she whispered. \"I'm not angry any\nmore. I'm just--at sea. I don't know what to think--what to do. Why try\nany longer? I think I'll go away--and give up.\"\n\n\"You mustn't do that,\" urged Magee. They came back into the firelight.\n\"Miss Thornhill has just informed me that she knows who has the\npackage!\"\n\n\"Indeed,\" said the girl calmly, but her face had flushed.\n\n\"I didn't let her tell me, of course.\"\n\n\"Why not?\" Oh, how maddening women could be!\n\n\"Why not?\" Magee's tone was hurt. \"Because I couldn't use her\ninformation in getting the money for you.\"\n\n\"You are still 'going to' get the money for me?\"\n\nMaddening certainly, as a rough-edged collar.\n\n\"Of--\" Magee began, but caught himself. No, he would prate no more of\n'going to'. \"I'll not ask you to believe it,\" he said, \"until I bring it\nto you and place it in your hand.\"\n\nShe turned her face slowly to his and lifted her blue eyes.\n\n\"I wonder,\" she said. \"I wonder.\"\n\nThe firelight fell on her lips, her hair, her eyes, and Mr. Magee knew\nthat his selfish bachelorhood was at an end. Hitherto, marriage had been\nto him the picture drawn by the pathetic exiled master. \"There are no\nmore pleasant by-paths down which you may wander, but the road lies long\nand straight and dusty to the grave.\" What if it were so? With the hand\nof a girl like this in his, what if the pleasant by-paths of his\nsolitude did bear hereafter the \"No Thoroughfare\" sign? Long the road\nmight be, and he would rejoice in its length; dusty perhaps, but her\nsmile through the dust would make it all worth while. He stooped to her.\n\n\"Give me, please,\" he said, \"the benefit of the doubt.\" It was a poor\nspeech compared to what was in his heart, but Billy Magee was rapidly\nlearning that most of the pretty speeches went with puppets who could\nnot feel.\n\nBland and Max came in from a brisk walk on the veranda. The mayor of\nReuton, who had been dozing near the desk, stirred.\n\n\"Great air up here,\" remarked Mr. Max, rubbing his hands before the\nfire. \"Ought to be pumped down into the region of the white lights. It\nsure would stir things up.\"\n\n\"It would put out the lights at ten p.m.,\" answered Mr. Magee, \"and\ninculcate other wholesome habits of living disastrous to the restaurant\nimpresarios.\"\n\nMiss Norton rose and ascended the stairs. Still the protesting Magee was\nat her heels. At the head of the stair she turned.\n\n\"You shall have your final chance,\" she said. \"The mayor, Max and Bland\nare alone in the office. I don't approve of eavesdropping at Baldpate in\nthe summer--it has spoiled a lot of perfectly adorable engagements. But\nin winter it's different. Whether you really want to help me or not I'm\nsure I don't know, but if you do, the conversation below now might prove\nof interest.\"\n\n\"I'm sure it would,\" Magee replied.\n\n\"Well, I have a scheme. Listen. Baldpate Inn is located in a temperance\ncounty. That doesn't mean that people don't drink here--it simply means\nthat there's a lot of mystery and romance connected with the drinking.\nSometimes those who follow the god of chance in the card-room late at\nnight grow thirsty. Now it happens that there is a trap-door in the\nfloor of the card-room, up which drinks are frequently passed from the\ncellar. Isn't that exciting? A hotel clerk who became human once in my\npresence told me all about it. If you went into the cellar and hunted\nabout, you might find that door and climb up into the card-room.\"\n\n\"A bully idea,\" agreed Mr. Magee. \"I'll hurry down there this minute.\nI'm more grateful than you can guess for this chance. And this time--but\nyou'll see.\"\n\nHe found the back stairs, and descended. In the kitchen the hermit got\nin his path.\n\n\"Mr. Magee,\" he pleaded, \"I consider that, in a way, I work for you\nhere. I've got something important to tell you. Just a minute--\"\n\n\"Sorry,\" answered Magee, \"but I can't possibly stop now. In an hour I'll\ntalk to you. Show me the cellar door, and don't mention where I've gone,\nthere's a good fellow.\"\n\nMr. Peters protested that his need of talk was urgent, but to no avail.\nMagee hurried to the cellar, and with the aid of a box of matches found\na ladder leading to a door cut in the floor above. He climbed through\ndust and cobwebs, unfastened the catch, and pushed cautiously upward. In\nanother minute he was standing in the chill little card-room. Softly he\nopened the card-room door about half an inch, and put his ear to it.\n\nThe three men were grouped very close at hand, and he heard Mr. Bland\nspeaking in low tones:\n\n\"I'm talking to you boys as a friend. The show is over. There ain't no\nuse hanging round for the concert--there won't be none. Go home and get\nsome clean collars and a square meal.\"\n\n\"If you think I'm going to be shook off by any fairy story like that,\"\nsaid the mayor of Reuton \"you're a child with all a child's touching\nfaith.\"\n\n\"All right,\" replied Mr. Bland, \"I thought I'd pass you the tip, that's\nall. It ain't nothing to me what you do. But it's all over, and you've\nlost out. I'm sorry you have--but I take Hayden's orders.\"\n\n\"Damn Hayden!\" snarled the mayor. \"It was his idea to make a three-act\nplay out of this thing. He's responsible for this silly trip to\nBaldpate. This audience we've been acting for--he let us in for them.\"\n\n\"I know,\" said Bland. \"But you can't deny that Baldpate Inn looked like\nthe ideal spot at first. Secluded, off the beaten path, you know, and\nall that.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" sneered the mayor, \"as secluded as a Sunday-school the Sunday\nbefore Christmas.\"\n\n\"Well, who could have guessed it?\" went on Mr. Bland. \"As I say, I don't\ncare what you do. I just passed you the tip. I've got that nice little\npackage of the long green--I've got it where you'll never find it. Yes,\nsir, it's returned to the loving hands of little Joe Bland, that brought\nit here first. It ain't going to roam no more. So what's the use of your\nsticking around?\"\n\n\"How did you get hold of it?\" inquired Mr. Lou Max.\n\n\"I had my eye on this little professor person,\" explained Mr. Bland.\n\"This morning when Magee went up the mountain I trailed the high-brow to\nMagee's room. When I busted in, unannounced by the butler, he was making\nhis getaway. I don't like to talk about what followed. He's an old man,\nand I sure didn't mean to break his glasses, nor scratch his dome of\nthought. There's ideas in that dome go back to the time of Anthony J.\nChaucer. But--he's always talking about that literature chair of\nhis--why couldn't he stay at home and sit in it? Anyhow, I got the\nbundle all right, all right. I wonder what the little fossil wants with\nit.\"\n\n\"The Doc's glasses _was_ broke,\" said Max, evidently to the mayor of\nReuton.\n\n\"Um-m,\" came Cargan's voice. \"Bland, how much do you make working for\nthis nice kind gentleman, Mr. Hayden?\"\n\n\"Oh, about two thousand a year, with pickings,\" replied Bland.\n\n\"Yes?\" went on Mr. Cargan. \"I ain't no Charles Dana Gibson with words.\nMy talk's a little rough and sketchy, I guess. But here's the outline,\nplain as I can make it. Two thousand a year from Hayden. Twenty thousand\nin two seconds if you hand that package to me.\"\n\n\"No,\" objected Bland. \"I've been honest--after a fashion. I can't quite\nstand for that. I'm working for Hayden.\"\n\n\"Don't be a fool,\" sneered Max.\n\n\"Of course,\" said the mayor, \"I appreciate your scruples, having had a\nfew in my day myself, though you'd never think so to read the _Star_.\nBut look at it sensible. The money belongs to me. If you was to hand it\nover you'd be just doing plain justice. What right has Hayden on his\nside? I did what was agreed--do I get my pay? No. Who are you to defeat\nthe ends of justice this way? That's how you ought to look at it. You\ngive me what's my due--and you put twenty thousand in your pocket by an\nhonest act. Hayden comes. He asks for the bundle. You point to the\ndynamited safe. You did your best.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Bland, but his tone was less firm. \"I can't go back on\nHayden. No--it wouldn't--\"\n\n\"Twenty thousand,\" repeated Cargan. \"Ten years' salary the way you're\ngoing ahead at present. A lot of money for a young man. If I was you I\nwouldn't hesitate a minute. Think. What's Hayden ever done for you?\nHe'll throw you down some day, the way he's thrown me.\"\n\n\"I--I--don't know--\" wavered Bland. Mr. Magee, in the card-room, knew\nthat Hayden's emissary was tottering on the brink.\n\n\"You could set up in business,\" whined Mr. Max. \"Why, if I'd had that\nmuch money at your age, I'd be a millionaire to-day.\"\n\n\"You get the package,\" suggested the mayor, \"take twenty thousand out,\nand slip the rest to me. No questions asked. I guess there ain't nobody\nmixed up in this affair will go up on the housetops and shout about it\nwhen we get back to Reuton.\"\n\n\"Well,--\" began Bland. He was lost. Suddenly the quiet of Baldpate\nMountain was assailed by a loud pounding at the inn door, and a voice\ncrying, \"Bland. Let me in.\"\n\n\"There's Hayden now,\" cried Mr. Bland.\n\n\"It ain't too late,\" came the mayor's voice, \"You can do it yet. It\nain't too late.\"\n\n\"Do what?\" cried Bland in a firm tone. \"You can't bribe me, Cargan.\" He\nraised his voice. \"Go round to the east door, Mr. Hayden.\" Then he\nadded, to Cargan: \"That's my answer. I'm going to let him in.\"\n\n\"Let him in,\" bellowed the mayor. \"Let the hound in. I guess I've got\nsomething to say to Mr. Hayden.\"\n\nThere came to Magee's ears the sound of opening doors, and of returning\nfootsteps.\n\n\"How do you do, Cargan,\" said a voice new to Baldpate.\n\n\"Cut the society howdydoes,\" replied the mayor hotly. \"There's a little\nscore to be settled between me and you, Hayden. I ain't quite wise to\nyour orchid-in-the-buttonhole ways. I don't quite follow them. I ain't\nbeen bred in the club you hang around--they blackballed me when I tried\nto get in. You know that. I'm a rough rude man. I don't understand your\nsystem. When I give my word, I keep it. Has that gone out of style up on\nthe avenue, where you live?\"\n\n\"There are conditions--\" began Hayden.\n\n\"The hell there are!\" roared Cargan. \"A man's word's his word, and he\nkeeps it to me, or I know the reason why. You can't come down to the\nCity Hall with any new deal like this. I was to have two hundred\nthousand. Why didn't I get it?\"\n\n\"Because,\" replied Hayden smoothly, \"the--er--little favor you were to\ngrant me in return is to be made useless by the courts.\"\n\n\"Can I help that?\" the mayor demanded. \"Was there anything about that in\nthe agreement? I did my work. I want my pay. I'll have it, _Mister_\nHayden.\"\n\nHayden's voice was cool and even as he spoke to Bland.\n\n\"Got the money, Joe?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Bland answered.\n\n\"Where?\"\n\n\"Well--we'd better wait, hadn't we?\" Bland's, voice was shaky.\n\n\"No. We'll take it and get out,\" answered Hayden.\n\n\"I want to see you do it,\" cried Cargan. \"If you think I've come up here\non a pleasure trip, I got a chart and a pointer all ready for your next\nlesson. And let me put you wise--this nobby little idea of yours about\nBaldpate Inn is the worst ever. The place is as full of people as if the\nregular summer rates was being charged.\"\n\n\"The devil it is!\" cried Hayden. His voice betrayed a startled\nannoyance.\n\n\"It hasn't worried me none,\" went on the mayor. \"They can't touch me. I\nown the prosecutor, and you know it. But it ain't going to do you any\ngood on the avenue if you're seen here with me. Is it, Mr. Hayden?\"\n\n\"The more reason,\" replied Hayden, \"for getting the money and leaving at\nonce. I'm not afraid of you, Cargan. I'm armed.\"\n\n\"I ain't,\" sneered the mayor. \"But no exquisite from your set with his\nlittle air-gun ever scared me. You try to get away from here with that\nbundle and you'll find yourself all tangled up in the worst scrap that\never happened.\"\n\n\"Where's the money, Joe?\" asked Hayden.\n\n\"You won't wait--\" Bland begged.\n\n\"Wait to get my own money--I guess not. Show me where it is.\"\n\n\"Remember,\" put in Cargan, \"that money's mine. And don't have any pipe\ndreams about the law--the law ain't called into things of this sort as a\nrule. I guess you'd be the last to call it. You'll never get away from\nhere with my money.\"\n\nMr. Magee opened the card-room door farther, and saw the figure of the\nstranger Hayden confronting the mayor. Mr. Cargan's title of exquisite\nbest described him. The newcomer was tall, fair, fastidious in dress and\nmanner. A revolver gleamed in his hand.\n\n\"Joe,\" he said firmly, \"take me to that money at once.\"\n\n\"It's out here,\" replied Bland. He and Hayden disappeared through the\ndining-room door into the darkness. Cargan and Max followed close\nbehind.\n\nHot with excitement, Mr. Magee slipped from his place of concealment. A\nbattle fit for the gods was in the air. He must be in the midst of\nit--perhaps again in a three-cornered fight it would be the third party\nthat would emerge victorious.\n\nIn the darkness of the dining-room he bumped into a limp clinging\nfigure. It proved to be the Hermit of Baldpate Mountain.\n\n\"I got to talk to you, Mr. Magee,\" he whispered in a frightened tremolo.\n\"I got to have a word with you this minute.\"\n\n\"Not now,\" cried Magee, pushing him aside. \"Later.\"\n\nThe hermit wildly seized his arm.\n\n\"No, now,\" he said. \"There's strange goings-on, here, Mr. Magee. I got\nsomething to tell you--about a package of money I found in the kitchen.\"\n\nMr. Magee stood very still. Beside him in the darkness he heard the\nhermit's excited breathing.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\nTHE SIGN OF THE OPEN WINDOW\n\n\nUndecided, Mr. Magee looked toward the kitchen door, from behind which\ncame the sound of men's voices. Then he smiled, turned and led Mr.\nPeters back into the office. The Hermit of Baldpate fairly trembled with\nnews.\n\n\"Since I broke in on you yesterday morning,\" he said in a low tone as he\ntook a seat on the edge of a chair, \"one thing has followed another so\nfast that I'm a little dazed. I can't just get the full meaning of it\nall.\"\n\n\"You have nothing on me there, Peters,\" Magee answered. \"I can't\neither.\"\n\n\"Well,\" went on the hermit, \"as I say, through all this downpour of\npeople, including women, I've hung on to one idea. I'm working for you.\nYou give me my wages. You're the boss. That's why I feel I ought to give\nwhat information I got to you.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" Mr. Magee agreed impatiently. \"Go ahead.\"\n\n\"Where you find women,\" Peters continued, \"there you find things beyond\nunderstanding. History--\"\n\n\"Get to the point.\"\n\n\"Well--yes. This afternoon I was looking round through the kitchen, sort\nof reconnoitering, you might say, and finding out what I have to work\nwith, for just between us, when some of this bunch goes I'll easily be\npersuaded to come back and cook for you. I was hunting round in the big\nrefrigerator with a candle, thinking maybe some little token of food had\nbeen left over from last summer's rush--something in a can that time can\nnot wither nor custom stale, as the poet says--and away up on the top\nshelf, in the darkest corner, I found a little package.\"\n\n\"Quick, Peters,\" cried Magee, \"where is that package now?\"\n\n\"I'm coming to that,\" went on the hermit, not to be hurried. \"What\nstruck me first about the thing was it didn't have any dust on it.\n'Aha,' I says, or words to that effect. I opened it. What do you think\nwas in it?\"\n\n\"I don't have to think--I know,\" said Magee. \"Money. In the name of\nheaven, Peters, tell me where you've got the thing.\"\n\n\"Just a minute, Mr. Magee. Let me tell it my way. You're right. There\nwas money in that package. Lots of it. Enough to found a university, or\nbuy a woman's gowns for a year. I was examining it careful-like when a\nshadow came in the doorway. I looked up--\"\n\n\"Who?\" asked Magee breathlessly.\n\n\"That little blinky-eyed Professor Bolton was standing there, most\nowlish and interested. He came into the refrigerator. 'That package you\nhave in your hand, Peters,' he says, 'belongs to me. I put it in cold\nstorage so it would keep. I'll take it now.' Well, Mr. Magee, I'm a\npeaceful man. I could have battered that professor into a learned sort\nof jelly if I'd wanted to. But I'm a great admirer of Mr. Carnegie, on\naccount of the library, and I go in for peace. I knew it wasn't exactly\nthe thing, but--\"\n\n\"You gave him the package?\"\n\n\"That's hardly the way I would put it, Mr. Magee. I made no outcry or\nresistance when he took it. 'I'm just a cook,' I says, 'in this house. I\nain't the trusted old family retainer that retains its fortunes like a\nsafety deposit vault.' So I let go the bundle. It was weak of me, I\nknow, but I sort of got the habit of giving up money, being married so\nmany years.\"\n\n\"Peters,\" said Mr. Magee, \"I'm sorry your grip was so insecure, but I'm\nmighty glad you came to me with this matter.\"\n\n\"He told me I wasn't to mention it to anybody,\" replied the hermit, \"but\nas I say, I sort of look on it that we were here first, and if our\nguests get to chasing untold wealth up and down the place, we ought to\nlet each other in on it.\"\n\n\"Correct,\" answered Magee. \"You are a valuable man, Peters. I want you\nto know that I appreciate the way you have acted in this affair.\" Four\nshadowy figures tramped in through the dining-room door. \"I should say,\"\nhe continued, \"that the menu you propose for dinner will prove most\ngratifying.\"\n\n\"What--oh--yes, sir,\" said Peters. \"Is that all?\"\n\n\"Quite,\" smiled Magee. \"Unless--just a minute, this may concern you--on\nmy word, there's another new face at Baldpate.\"\n\nHe stood up, and in the light of the fire met Hayden. Now he saw that\nthe face of the latest comer was scheming and weak, and that under a\nsmall blond mustache a very cruel mouth sought to hide. The stranger\ngazed at Magee with an annoyance plainly marked.\n\n\"A friend of mine--Mr.--er--Downs, Mr. Magee,\" muttered Bland.\n\n\"Oh, come now,\" smiled Magee. \"Let's tell our real names. I heard you\ngreeting your friend a minute ago. How are you, Mr. Hayden?\"\n\nHe held out his hand. Hayden looked him angrily in the eyes.\n\n\"Who the devil are you?\" he asked.\n\n\"Do you mean,\" said Magee, \"that you didn't catch the name. It's\nMagee--William Hallowell Magee. I hold a record hereabouts, Mr. Hayden.\nI spent nearly an hour at Baldpate Inn--alone. You see, I was the first\nof our amiable little party to arrive. Let me make you welcome. Are you\nstaying to dinner? You must.\"\n\n\"I'm not,\" growled Hayden.\n\n\"Don't believe him, Mr. Magee,\" sneered the mayor, \"he doesn't always\nsay what he means. He's going to stay, all right.\"\n\n\"Yes, you'd better, Mr. Hayden,\" advised Bland.\n\n\"Huh--delighted, I'm sure,\" snapped Hayden. He strolled over to the\nwall, and in the light of the fire examined a picture nonchalantly.\n\n\"The pride of our inn,\" Mr. Magee, following, explained pleasantly, \"the\nadmiral. It is within these very walls in summer that he plays his\nfamous game of solitaire.\"\n\nHayden wheeled quickly, and looked Magee in the eyes. A flush crossed\nhis face, leaving it paler than before. He turned away without speaking.\n\n\"Peters,\" said Magee, \"you heard what Mr. Hayden said. An extra plate at\ndinner, please. I must leave you for a moment, gentlemen.\" He saw that\ntheir eyes followed him eagerly--full of suspicion, menacing. \"We shall\nall meet again, very shortly.\"\n\nHayden slipped quickly between Magee and the stairs. The latter faced\nhim smilingly, reflecting as he did so that he could love this man but\nlittle.\n\n\"Who are you?\" said Hayden again. \"What is your business here?\"\n\nMagee laughed outright, and turned to the other men.\n\n\"How unfortunate,\" he said, \"this gentleman does not know the manners\nand customs of Baldpate in winter. Those are questions, Mr. Hayden, that\nwe are never impolite enough to ask of one another up here.\" He moved on\ntoward the stairs, and reluctantly Hayden got out of his path. \"I am\nvery happy,\" he added, \"that you are to be with us at dinner. It will\nnot take you long to accustom yourself to our ways, I'm sure.\"\n\nHe ran up the stairs and passed through number seven out upon the\nbalcony. Trudging through the snow, he soon sighted the room of\nProfessor Bolton. And as he did so, a little shiver that was not due to\natmospheric conditions ran down his spine. For one of the professor's\nwindows stood wide open, bidding a welcome to the mountain storm. Peters\nhad spoken the truth. Once more that tight little, right little package\nwas within Mr. Magee's ken.\n\nHe stepped through the open window, and closed it after him. By the\ntable sat Professor Bolton, wrapped in coats and blankets, reading by\nthe light of a solitary candle. The book was held almost touching his\nnose--a reminder of the spectacles that were gone. As Magee entered the\nold man looked up, and a very obvious expression of fright crossed his\nface.\n\n\"Good evening, Professor,\" said Magee easily. \"Don't you find it rather\ncool with the window open?\"\n\n\"Mr. Magee,\" replied the much wrapped gentleman, \"I am that rather\ndisturbing progressive--a fresh air devotee. I feel that God's good air\nwas meant to be breathed, not barricaded from our bodies.\"\n\n\"Perhaps,\" suggested Magee, \"I should have left the window open?\"\n\nThe old man regarded him narrowly.\n\n\"I have no wish to be inhospitable,\" he replied. \"But--if you please--\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" answered Magee. He threw open the window. The professor\nheld up his book.\n\n\"I was passing the time before dinner with my pleasant old companion,\nMontaigne. Mr. Magee, have you ever read his essay on liars?\"\n\n\"Never,\" said Magee. \"But I do not blame you for brushing up on it at\nthe present time, Professor. I have come to apologize. Yesterday morning\nI referred in a rather unpleasant way to a murder in the chemical\nlaboratory at one of our universities. I said that the professor of\nchemistry was missing. This morning's paper, which I secured from Mr.\nPeters, informs me that he has been apprehended.\"\n\n\"You need not have troubled to tell me,\" said the old man. He smiled his\nbleak smile.\n\n\"I did you an injustice,\" went on Magee.\n\n\"Let us say no more of it,\" pleaded Professor Bolton.\n\nMr. Magee walked about the room. Warily the professor turned so that the\nother was at no instant at his back. He looked so helpless, so little,\nso ineffectual, that Mr. Magee abandoned his first plan of leaping upon\nhim there in the silence. By more subtle means than this must his\npurpose be attained.\n\n\"I suppose,\" he said, \"your love of fresh air accounts for the strolls\non the balcony at all hours of the night?\"\n\nThe old man merely blinked at him.\n\n\"I mustn't stop,\" Magee continued. \"I just wanted to make my apology,\nthat's all. It was unjust of me. Murder--that is hardly in your line. By\nthe way, were you by any chance in my room this morning, Professor\nBolton?\"\n\nSilence.\n\n\"Pardon me,\" remarked the professor at last, \"if I do not answer. In\nthis very essay on--on liars, Montaigne has expressed it so well. 'And\nhow much is a false speech less sociable than silence.' I am a sociable\nman.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" smiled Magee. He stood looking down at the frail old\nscholar before him, and considered. Of what avail a scuffle there in\nthat chill room? The package was no doubt safely hidden in a corner he\ncould not quickly find. No he must wait, and watch.\n\n\"Good-by, until dinner,\" he said, \"and may you find much in your wise\ncompanion's book to justify your conduct.\"\n\nHe went out through the open window, and in another moment stood just\noutside Miss Norton's room. She put a startled head out at his knock.\n\n\"Oh, it's you,\" she said. \"I can't invite you in. You might learn\nterrible secrets of the dressing-table--mamma is bedecking herself for\ndinner. Has anything happened?\"\n\n\"Throw something over your head, Juliet,\" smiled Magee, \"the balcony is\nwaiting for you.\"\n\nShe was at his side in a moment, and they walked briskly along the\nshadowy white floor.\n\n\"I know who has the money,\" said Magee softly. \"Simply through a turn of\nluck, I know. I realize that my protestations of what I am going to do\nhave bored you. But it looks very much to me as if that package would be\nin your hands very soon.\"\n\nShe did not reply.\n\n\"And when I have got it, and have given it to you--if I do,\" he\ncontinued, \"what then?\"\n\n\"Then,\" she answered, \"I must go away--very quickly. And no one must\nknow, or they will try to stop me.\"\n\n\"And after that?\"\n\n\"The deluge,\" she laughed without mirth.\n\nUp above them the great trees of Baldpate Mountain waved their black\narms constantly as though sparring with the storm. At the foot of the\nburied roadway they could see the lamps of Upper Asquewan Falls; under\nthose lamps prosaic citizens were hurrying home with the supper\ngroceries through the night. And not one of those citizens was within\nmiles of guessing that up on the balcony of Baldpate Inn a young man had\nseized a young woman's hand, and was saying wildly: \"Beautiful girl--I\nlove you.\"\n\nYet that was exactly what Billy Magee was doing. The girl had turned her\nface away.\n\n\"You've known me just two days,\" she said.\n\n\"If I can care this much in two days,\" he said, \"think--but that's old,\nisn't it? Sometime soon I'm going to say to you: 'Whose girl are you?'\nand you're going to look up at me with a little heaven for two in your\neyes and say: 'I'm Billy Magee's girl.' So before we go any further I\nmust confess everything--I must tell you who this Billy Magee is--this\nman you're going to admit you belong to, my dear.\"\n\n\"You read the future glibly,\" she replied. \"Are your prophecies true, I\nwonder?\"\n\n\"Absolutely. Some time ago--on my soul, it was only yesterday--I asked\nif you had read a certain novel called _The Lost Limousine_, and you\nsaid you had, and that--it wasn't sincere. Well, I wrote it--\"\n\n\"Oh!\" cried the girl.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Magee, \"and I've done others like it. Oh, yes, my muse has\nbeen a _nouveau riche_ lady in a Worth gown, my ambition a big red\nmotor-car. I've been a 'scramble a cent, mister' troubadour beckoning\nfrom the book-stalls. It was good fun writing those things, and it\nbrought me more money than was good for me. I'm not ashamed of them;\nthey were all right as a beginning in the game. But the other day--I\nthought an advertisement did the trick--I turned tired of that sort, and\nI decided to try the other kind--the real kind. I thought it was an\nadvertisement that did it--but I see now it was because you were just a\nfew days away.\"\n\n\"Don't tell me,\" whispered the girl, \"that you came up here to--to--\"\n\n\"Yes,\" smiled Magee, \"I came up here to forget forever the world's giddy\nmelodrama, the wild chase for money through deserted rooms, shots in the\nnight, cupid in the middle distance. I came here to do--literature--if\nit's in me to do it.\"\n\nThe girl leaned limply against the side of Baldpate Inn.\n\n\"Oh, the irony of it!\" she cried.\n\n\"I know,\" he said, \"it's ridiculous. I think all this is meant just\nfor--temptation. I shall be firm. I'll remember your parable of the\nblind girl--and the lamp that was not lighted. I'll do the real stuff.\nSo that when you say--as you certainly must some day--'I'm Billy Magee's\ngirl' you can say it proudly.\"\n\n\"I'm sure,\" she said softly, \"that if I ever do say it--oh, no, I didn't\nsay I would\"--for he had seized her hands quickly--\"if I ever do say\nit--it will certainly be proudly. But now--you don't even know my\nname--my right one. You don't know what I do, nor where I come from, nor\nwhat I want with this disgusting bundle of money. I sort of feel, you\nknow--that this is in the air at Baldpate, even in the winter time. No\nsooner have the men come than they begin to talk of--love--to whatever\ngirls they find here--on this very balcony--down there under the trees.\nAnd the girls listen, for--it's in the air, that's all. Then autumn\ncomes, and everybody laughs, and forgets. May not our autumn come--when\nI go away?\"\n\n\"Never,\" cried Magee. \"This is no summer hotel affair to me. It's a real\nin winter and summer love, my dear--in spring and fall--and when you go\naway, I'm going too, about ten feet behind.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she laughed, \"they talk that way at Baldpate--the last weeks of\nsummer. It's part of the game.\" They had come to the side of the hotel\non which was the annex, and the girl stopped and pointed. \"Look!\" she\nwhispered breathlessly.\n\nIn a window of the annex had appeared for a moment a flickering yellow\nlight. But only for a moment.\n\n\"I know,\" said Mr. Magee. \"There's somebody in there. But that isn't\nimportant in comparison. This is no summer affair, dear. Look to the\nthermometer for proof. I love you. And when you go away, I shall\nfollow.\"\n\n\"And the book--\"\n\n\"I have found better inspiration than Baldpate Inn.\"\n\nThey walked along for a time in silence.\n\n\"You forget,\" said the girl, \"you only know who has the money.\"\n\n\"I will get it,\" he answered confidently. \"Something tells me I will.\nUntil I do, I am content to say no more.\"\n\n\"Good-by,\" said the girl. She stood in the window of her room, while a\nharsh voice called \"That you, dearie?\" from inside. \"And I may add,\" she\nsmiled, \"that in my profession--a following is considered\nquite--desirable.\"\n\nShe disappeared, and Mr. Magee, after a few minutes in his room,\ndescended again to the office. In the center of the room, Elijah Quimby\nand Hayden stood face to face.\n\n\"What is it, Quimby?\" asked Magee.\n\n\"I just ran up to see how things were going,\" Quimby replied, \"and I\nfind him here.\"\n\n\"Our latest guest,\" smiled Magee.\n\n\"I was just reminding Mr. Hayden,\" Quimby said, his teeth set, an angry\nlight in his eyes, \"that the last time we met he ordered me from his\noffice. I told you, Mr. Magee, that the Suburban Railway once promised\nto make use of my invention. Then Mr. Kendrick went away--and this man\ntook charge. When I came around to the offices again--he laughed at me.\nWhen I came the second time, he called me a loafer and ordered me out.\"\n\nHe paused, and faced Hayden again.\n\n\"I've grown bitter, here on the mountain,\" he said, \"as I've thought\nover what you and men like you said to me--as I've thought of what might\nhave been--and what was--yes, I've grown pretty bitter. Time after time\nI've gone over in my mind that scene in your office. As I've sat here\nthinking you've come to mean to me all the crowd that made a fool of me.\nYou've come to mean to me all the crowd that said 'The public be damned'\nin my ear. I haven't ever forgot--how you ordered me out of your\noffice.\"\n\n\"Well?\" asked Hayden.\n\n\"And now,\" Quimby went on, \"I find you trespassing in a hotel left in my\ncare--the tables are turned. I ought to show you the door. I ought to\nput you out.\"\n\n\"Try it,\" sneered Hayden.\n\n\"No,\" answered Quimby, \"I ain't going to do it. Maybe it's because I've\ngrown timid, brooding over my failure. And maybe it's because I know\nwho's got the seventh key.\"\n\nHayden made no reply. No one stirred for a minute, and then Quimby moved\naway, and went out through the dining-room door.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\nTABLE TALK\n\n\nThe seventh key! Mr. Magee thrilled at the mention of it. So Elijah\nQuimby knew the identity and the mission of the man who hid in the\nannex. Did any one else? Magee looked at the broad acreage of the\nmayor's face, at the ancient lemon of Max's, at Bland's, frightened and\nthoughtful, at Hayden's, concerned but smiling. Did any one else know?\nAh, yes, of course. Down the stairs the professor of Comparative\nLiterature felt his way to food.\n\n\"Is dinner ready?\" he asked, peering about.\n\nThe candles flickered weakly as they fought the stronger shadows; winter\nroared at the windows; somewhere above a door crashed shut. Close to its\nfinal scene drew the drama at Baldpate Inn. Mr. Magee knew it, he could\nnot have told why. The others seemed to know it, too. In silence they\nwaited while the hermit scurried along his dim way preparing the meal.\nIn silence they sat while Miss Norton and her mother descended. Once\nthere was a little flurry of interest when Miss Thornhill and Hayden met\nat the foot of the stairs.\n\n\"Myra!\" Hayden cried. \"In heaven's name--what does this mean?\"\n\n\"Unfortunately,\" said the girl, \"I know--all it means.\"\n\nAnd Hayden fell back into the shadows.\n\nFinally the attitude of the hermit suggested that the dinner was ready.\n\n\"I guess you might as well sit down,\" he remarked. \"It's all fixed, what\nthere is to fix. This place don't need a cook, it needs a commissary\ndepartment.\"\n\n\"Peters,\" reproved Magee. \"That's hardly courteous to our guests.\"\n\n\"Living alone on the mountain,\" replied the hermit from the dining-room\ndoor, \"you get to have such a high regard for the truth you can't put\ncourtesy first. You want to, but you haven't the heart.\"\n\nThe winter guests took their places at the table, and the second\nDecember dinner at Baldpate Inn got under way. But not so genially as on\nthe previous night did it progress. On the faces of those about him Mr.\nMagee noted worry and suspicion; now and again menacing cold eyes were\nturned upon him; evidently first in the thoughts of those at table was a\nlittle package rich in treasure; and evidently first in the thoughts of\nmost of them, as the probable holder of that package, was Mr. Magee\nhimself. Several times he looked up to find Max's cat-like eyes upon\nhim, sinister and cruel behind the incongruous gold-rimmed glasses;\nseveral times he saw Hayden's eyes, hostile and angry, seek his face.\nThey were desperate; they would stop at nothing; Mr. Magee felt that as\nthe drama drew to its close they saw him and him alone between them and\ntheir golden desires.\n\n\"Before I came up here to be a hermit,\" remarked Cargan\ncontemporaneously with the removal of the soup, \"which I may say in\npassing I ain't been able to be with any success owing to the popularity\nof the sport on Baldpate Mountain, there was never any candles on the\ntable where I et. No, sir. I left them to the people up on the\navenue--to Mr. Hayden and his kind that like to work in dim\nsurroundings--I was always strong for a bright light on my food. What\nI'm afraid of is that I'll get the habit up here, and will be wanting\nCharlie to set out a silver candelabrum with my lager. Candles'd be\nquite an innovation at Charlie's, wouldn't they, Lou?\"\n\n\"Too swell for Charlie's,\" commented Mr. Max. \"Except after closing\nhours. I've seen 'em in use there then, but the idea wasn't glory and\ndecoration.\"\n\n\"I hope you don't dislike the candles, Mr. Cargan,\" remarked Miss\nNorton. \"They add such a lot to the romance of the affair, don't you\nthink? I'm terribly thrilled by all this. The rattling of the windows,\nand the flickering light--two lines of a poem keep running through my\nhead:\n\n    \"'My lord he followed after one who whispered in his ear--\n     The weeping of the candles and the wind is all I hear.'\n\nI don't know who the lord was, nor what he followed--perhaps the seventh\nkey. But the weeping candles and the wind seem so romantic--and so like\nBaldpate Inn to-night.\"\n\n\"If I had a daughter your age,\" commented Cargan, not unkindly, \"she'd\nbe at home reading Laura Jean Libbey by the fire, and not chasing after\nromance on a mountain.\"\n\n\"That would be best for her, I'm sure,\" replied the girl sweetly. \"For\nthen she wouldn't be likely to find out things about her father that\nwould prove disquieting.\"\n\n\"Dearie!\" cried Mrs. Norton. No one else spoke, but all looked at the\nmayor. He was busily engaged with his food. Smiling his amusement, Mr.\nMagee sought to direct the conversation into less personal channels.\n\n\"We hear so much about romance, especially since its widely advertised\ndeath,\" he said. \"And to every man I ever met, it meant something\ndifferent. Mr. Cargan, speaking as a broad-minded man of the world--what\ndoes romance mean to you?\"\n\nThe mayor ran his fingers through his graying hair, and considered\nseriously.\n\n\"Romance,\" he reflected. \"Well, I ain't much on the talk out of books.\nBut here's what I see when you say that word to me. It's the night\nbefore election, and I'm standing in the front window of the little room\non Main Street where the boys can always find me. Down the street I hear\nthe snarl and rumble of bands, and pretty soon I see the yellow flicker\nof torches, like the flicker of that candle, and the bobbing of banners.\nAnd then--the boys march by. All the boys! Pat Doherty, and Bob Larsen,\nand Matt Sanders--all the boys! And when they get to my window they wave\ntheir hats and cheer. Just a fat old man in that window, but they'll go\nto the pavement with any guy that knocks him. They're loyal. They're for\nme. And so they march by--cheering and singing--all the boys--just for\nme to see and hear. Well--that--that's romance to me.\"\n\n\"Power,\" translated Mr. Magee.\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" cried the mayor. \"I know I've got them. All the reformers in\nthe world can't spoil my thrill then. They're mine. I guess old Napoleon\nknew that thrill. I guess he was the greatest romancer the world ever\nknew. When he marched over the mountains with his starving bunch--and\nlooked back and saw them in rags and suffering--for him--well I reckon\nold Nap was as close to romance then as any man ever gets.\"\n\n\"I wonder,\" answered Mr. Magee. It came to him suddenly that in each\nperson's definition of this intangible thing might lie exposed something\nof both character and calling. At the far end of the table Mrs. Norton's\nlined tired face met his gaze. To her he put his question.\n\n\"Well,\" she answered, and her voice seemed softer than its wont, \"I\nain't thought much of that word for a good many years now. But when I\ndo--say, I seem to see myself sitting on our porch back home--thirty\nyears ago. I've got on a simple little muslin dress, and I'm slender as\nElsie Janis, and the color in my cheeks is--well, it's the sort that\nNorton likes. And my hair--but--I'm thinking of him, of Norton. He's\ntold me he wants to make me happy for life, and I've about decided I'll\nlet him try. I see him--coming up our front walk. Coming to call on\nme--have I mentioned I've got a figure--a real sweet figure? That's\nabout what romance means to me.\"\n\n\"Youth, dear?\" asks Miss Norton gently.\n\n\"That's it, dearie,\" answered the older woman dreamily. \"Youth.\"\n\nFor a time those about the table sat in silence, picturing no doubt the\nslender figure on the steps of that porch long ago. Not without a\nhumorous sort of pity did they glance occasionally toward the woman whom\nNorton had begged to make happy. The professor of Comparative Literature\nwas the first to break the silence.\n\n\"The dictionary,\" he remarked academically, \"would define romance as a\nspecies of fictitious writing originally composed in the Romance\ndialects, and afterward in prose. But--the dictionary is prosaic, it has\nno soul. Shall I tell you what romance means to me? I will. I see a man\ntoiling in a dim laboratory, where there are strange fires and stranger\nodors. Night and day he experiments, the love of his kind in his eyes, a\ndesire to help in his heart. And then--the golden moment--the great\nmoment in that quiet dreary cell--the moment of the discovery. A serum,\na formula--what not. He gives it to the world and a few of the sick are\nwell again, and a few of the sorrowful are glad. Romance means neither\nyouth nor power to me. It means--service.\"\n\nHe bent his dim old eyes on his food, and Mr. Magee gazed at him with a\nnew wonder. Odd sentiments these from an old man who robbed fireplaces,\nheld up hermits, and engaged in midnight conferences by the annex door.\nMore than ever Magee was baffled, enthralled, amused. Now Mr. Max leered\nabout the table and contributed his unsavory bit.\n\n\"Funny, ain't it,\" he remarked, \"the different things the same word\nmeans to a bunch of folks. Say romance to me, and I don't see no dim\nlaboratory. I don't see nothing dim. I see the brightest lights in the\nworld, and the best food, and somebody, maybe, dancing the latest freak\ndance in between the tables. And an orchestra playing in the\ndistance--classy dames all about--a taxi clicking at the door. And me\nsending word to the chauffeur 'Let her click till the milk carts\nrumble--I can pay.' Say--that sure is romance to me.\"\n\n\"Mr. Hayden,\" remarked Magee, \"are we to hear from you?\"\n\nHayden hesitated, and looked for a moment into the black eyes of Myra\nThornhill.\n\n\"My idea has often been contradicted,\" he said, keeping his gaze on the\ngirl, \"it may be again. But to me the greatest romance in the world is\nthe romance of money making--dollar piling on dollar in the vaults of\nthe man who started with a shoe-string, and hope, and nerve. I see him\nfighting for the first thousand--and then I see his pile growing, slowly\nat first--faster--faster--faster--until a motor-car brings him to his\noffice, and men speak his name with awe in the streets.\"\n\n\"Money,\" commented Miss Thornhill contemptuously. \"What an idea of\nromance for a man.\"\n\n\"I did not expect,\" replied Hayden, \"that my definition would pass\nunchallenged. My past experiences--\" he looked meaningly at the\ngirl--\"had led me to be prepared for that. But it is my definition--I\nspoke the truth. You must give me credit for that.\"\n\n\"I ain't one to blame you,\" sneered Cargan, \"for wanting it noticed when\nyou do side-step a lie. Yes, I certainly--\"\n\n\"See here, Cargan,\" blazed Hayden.\n\n\"Yes, you did speak the truth,\" put in Miss Thornhill hastily. \"You\nmentioned one word in your definition--it was a desecration to drag it\nin--hope. For me romance means only--hope. And I'm afraid there are a\npitiful number in the world to whom it means the same.\"\n\n\"We ain't heard from the young woman who started all this fuss over a\nlittle word,\" Mr. Cargan reminded them.\n\n\"That's right, dearie,\" said Mrs. Norton. \"You got to contribute.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" agreed the girl with the \"locks crisped like golden wire,\" \"I\nwill. But it's hard. One's ideas change so rapidly. A moment ago if you\nhad said romance to me, I might have babbled of shady corners, of\nwhisperings on the stair, of walks down the mountain in the\nmoonlight--or even on the hotel balcony.\" She smiled gaily at Magee.\n\"Perhaps to-morrow, too, the word might mean such rapturous things to\nme. But to-night--life is too real and earnest to-night.\nService--Professor Bolton was right--service is often romance. It may\nmean the discovery of a serum--it may mean so cruel a thing as the\nblighting of another's life romance.\" She gazed steadily at the stolid\nCargan. \"It may mean putting an end forever to those picturesque parades\npast the window of the little room on Main Street--the room where the\nboys can always find the mayor of Reuton.\"\n\nStill she gazed steadily into Cargan's eyes. And with an amused smile\nthe mayor gazed back.\n\n\"You wouldn't be so cruel as that,\" he assured her easily; \"a nice\nattractive girl like you.\"\n\nThe dinner was at an end; without a word the sly little professor rose\nfrom the table and hurriedly ascended the stairs. Mr. Magee watched him\ndisappear, and resolved to follow quickly on his heels. But first he\npaused to give his own version of the word under discussion.\n\n\"Strange,\" he remarked, \"that none of you gets the picture I do.\nRomance--it is here--at your feet in Baldpate Inn. A man climbs the\nmountain to be alone with his thoughts, to forget the melodrama of life,\nto get away from the swift action of the world, and meditate. He is\nalone--for very near an hour. Then a telephone bell tinkles, and a youth\nrises out of the dark to prate of a lost Arabella, and haberdashery. A\nshot rings out, as the immemorial custom with shots, and in comes a\nprofessor of Comparative Literature, with a perforation in his derby\nhat. A professional hermit arrives to teach the amateur the fine points\nof the game. A charming maid comes in--too late for breakfast--but in\nplenty of time for walks on the balcony in the moonlight. The mayor of a\nmunicipality condescends to stay for dinner. A battle in the snow\nensues. There is a weird talk of--a sum of money. More guests arrive.\nDark hints of a seventh key. Why, bless you, you needn't stir from\nBaldpate Inn in search of your romance.\"\n\nHe crossed the floor hastily, and put one foot on the lower step of\nBaldpate's grand stairway. He kept it there. For from the shadows of the\nlanding Professor Bolton emerged, his blasted derby once more on his\nhead, his overcoat buttoned tight, his ear-muffs in place, his\ntraveling-bag and green umbrella in tow.\n\n\"What, Professor,\" cried Magee, \"you're leaving?\"\n\nNow, truly, the end of the drama had come. Mr. Magee felt his heart beat\nwildly. What was the end to be? What did this calm departure mean?\nSurely the little man descending the stair was not, Daniel-like,\nthrusting himself into this lion's den with the precious package in his\npossession?\n\n\"Yes,\" the old man was saying slowly. \"I am about to leave. The decision\ncame suddenly. I am sorry to go. Certainly I have enjoyed these chance\nmeetings.\"\n\n\"See here, Doc,\" said Mr. Bland, uneasily feeling of his purple tie,\n\"you're not going back and let them reporters have another fling at\nyou?\"\n\n\"I fear I must,\" replied the old man. \"My duty calls. Yes, they will\nhound me. I shall hear much of peroxide blondes. I shall be asked again\nto name the ten greatest in history,--a difficult, not to say dangerous\ntask. But I must face the--er--music, as the vulgar expression goes. I\nbid you good-by, Mr. Bland. We part friends, I am sure. Again be\ncomforted by the thought that I do not hold the ruined derby against\nyou. Even though, as I have remarked with unpleasant truth, the\nhonorarium of a professor at our university is not large.\"\n\nHe turned to Magee.\n\n\"I regret more than I can say,\" he continued, \"parting from you. My eyes\nfell upon you first on entering this place--we have had exciting times\ntogether. My dear Miss Norton--knowing you has refreshed an old man's\nheart. I might compare you to another with yellow locks--but I leave\nthat to my younger--er--colleagues. Mr. Cargan--good-by. My acquaintance\nwith you I shall always look back on--\"\n\nBut the mayor of Reuton, Max and Bland closed in on the old man.\n\n\"Now look here, Doc,\" interrupted Cargan. \"You're bluffing. Do you get\nme? You're trying to put something over. I don't want to be rough--I\nlike you--but I got to get a glimpse at the inside of that satchel. And\nI got to examine your personal make-up a bit.\"\n\n\"Dear, dear,\" smiled Professor Bolton, \"you don't think I would steal? A\nman in my position? Absurd. Look through my poor luggage if you desire.\nYou will find nothing but the usual appurtenances of travel.\"\n\nHe stood docilely in the middle of the floor, and blinked at the group\naround him.\n\nMr. Magee waited to hear no more. It was quite apparent that this wise\nlittle man carried no package wildly sought by Baldpate's winter guests.\nQuietly and quickly Magee disappeared up the broad stair, and tried the\nprofessor's door. It was locked. Inside he could hear a window banging\nback and forth in the storm. He ran through number seven and out upon\nthe snow-covered balcony.\n\nThere he bumped full into a shadowy figure hurrying in the opposite\ndirection.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\nA MAN FROM THE DARK\n\n\nFor fully five seconds Mr. Magee and the man with whom he had collided\nstood facing each other on the balcony. The identical moon of the summer\nromances now hung in the sky, and in its white glare Baldpate Mountain\nglittered like a Christmas-card. Suddenly the wind broke a small branch\nfrom one of the near-by trees and tossed it lightly on the snow beside\nthe two men--as though it were a signal for battle.\n\n\"A lucky chance,\" said Mr. Magee. \"You're a man I've been longing to\nmeet. Especially since the professor left his window open this\nafternoon.\"\n\n\"Indeed,\" replied the other calmly. \"May I ask what you want of me?\"\n\n\"Certainly.\" Mr. Magee laughed. \"A little package. I think it's in your\npocket at this minute. A package no bigger than a man's hand.\"\n\nThe stranger made no reply, but looked quickly about, over his shoulder\nat the path along which he had come, and then past Mr. Magee at the road\nthat led to freedom.\n\n\"I think it's in your pocket,\" repeated Mr. Magee, \"and I'm going to\nfind out.\"\n\n\"I haven't time to argue with you,\" said the holder of the seventh key.\nHis voice was cold, calculating, harsh. \"Get out of my way and let me\npass. Or--\"\n\n\"Or what?\" asked Billy Magee.\n\nHe watched the man lunge toward him in the moonlight. He saw the fist\nthat had the night before been the Waterloo of Mr. Max and the mayor\nstart on a swift true course for his head. Quickly he dodged to one side\nand closed with his opponent.\n\nBack and forth through the snow they ploughed, panting, grappling,\nstraining. Mr. Magee soon realized that his adversary was no weakling.\nHe was forced to call into play muscles he had not used in what seemed\nages--not since he sported of an afternoon in a rather odorous college\ngymnasium. In moonlight and shadow, up and down, they reeled, staggered,\nstumbled, the sole jarring notes in that picture of Baldpate on a quiet\nwinter's night.\n\n\"You queered the game last time,\" muttered the stranger. \"But you'll\nnever queer it again.\"\n\nMr. Magee saved his breath. Together they crashed against the side of\nthe inn. Together they squirmed away, across the balcony to the railing.\nStill back and forth, now in the moonlight, now in shadow, wildly they\nfought. Once Mr. Magee felt his feet slip from beneath him, but caught\nhimself in time. His strength was going--surely--quickly. Then suddenly\nhis opponent seemed to weaken in his grip. With a supreme effort Magee\nforced him down upon the balcony floor, and tumbled on top of him. He\nfelt the chill of the snow under his knees, and its wetness in his\ncuffs.\n\n\"Now,\" he cried to himself.\n\nThe other still struggled desperately. But his struggle was without\nsuccess. For deftly Billy Magee drew from his pocket the precious\npackage about which there had been so much debate on Baldpate Mountain.\nHe clasped it close, rose and ran. In another second he was inside\nnumber seven, and had lighted a candle at the blazing logs.\n\nOnce more he examined that closely packed little bundle; once more he\nfound it rich in greenbacks. Assuredly it was the greatly desired thing\nhe had fought for the night before. He had it again. And this time, he\ntold himself, he would not lose sight of it until he had placed it in\nthe hands of the girl of the station.\n\nThe dark shadow of the man he had just robbed was hovering at his\nwindows. Magee turned hastily to the door. As he did so it opened, and\nHayden entered. He carried a pistol in his hand; his face was hard,\ncruel, determined; his usually expressionless eyes lighted with pleasure\nas they fell on the package in Mr. Magee's possession.\n\n\"It seems I'm just in time,\" he said, \"to prevent highway robbery.\"\n\n\"You think so?\" asked Magee.\n\n\"See here, young man,\" remarked Hayden, glancing nervously over his\nshoulder, \"I can't waste any time in talk. Does that money belong to\nyou? No. Well, it does belong to me. I'm going to have it. Don't think\nI'm afraid to shoot to get it. The law permits a man to fire on the\nthief who tries to fleece him.\"\n\n\"The law, did you say?\" laughed Billy Magee. \"I wouldn't drag the law\ninto this if I were you, Mr. Hayden. I'm sure it has no connection with\nevents on Baldpate Mountain. You would be the last to want its attention\nto be directed here. I've got this money, and I'm going to keep it.\"\n\nHayden considered a brief moment, and then swore under his breath.\n\n\"You're right,\" he said. \"I'm not going to shoot. But there are other\nways, you whipper-snapper--\" He dropped the revolver into his pocket and\nsprang forward. For the second time within ten minutes Mr. Magee\nsteadied himself for conflict.\n\nBut Hayden stopped. Some one had entered the room through the window\nbehind Magee. In the dim light of the single candle Magee saw Hayden's\nface go white, his lip twitch, his eyes glaze with horrible surprise.\nHis arms fell limply to his sides.\n\n\"Good God! Kendrick!\" he cried.\n\nThe voice of the man with whom Billy Magee had but a moment before\nstruggled on the balcony answered:\n\n\"Yes, Hayden. I'm back.\"\n\nHayden wet his lips with his tongue.\n\n\"What--what brought you?\" he asked, his voice trailing off weakly on the\nlast word.\n\n\"What brought me?\" Suddenly, as from a volcano that had long been cold,\nfire blazed up in Kendrick's eyes. \"If a man knew the road from hell\nback home, what would it need to bring him back?\"\n\nHayden stood with his mouth partly open; almost a grotesque picture of\nterror he looked in that dim light. Then he spoke, in an odd strained\ntone, more to himself than to any one else.\n\n\"I thought you were dead,\" he said. \"I told myself you'd never come\nback. Over and over--in the night--I told myself that. But all the\ntime--I knew--I knew you'd come.\"\n\nA cry--a woman's cry--sounded from just outside the door of number\nseven. Into the room came Myra Thornhill; quickly she crossed and took\nKendrick's hands in hers.\n\n\"David,\" she sobbed. \"Oh, David--is it a dream--a wonderful dream?\"\n\nKendrick looked into her eyes, sheepishly at first, then gladly as he\nsaw what was in them. For the light there, under the tears, was such as\nno man could mistake. Magee saw it. Hayden saw it too, and his voice was\neven more lifeless when he spoke.\n\n\"Forgive me, David,\" he said. \"I didn't mean--\"\n\nAnd then, as he saw that Kendrick did not listen, he turned and walked\nquietly into the bedroom of number seven, taking no notice of Cargan and\nBland, who, with the other winter guests of Baldpate, now crowded the\ndoorway leading to the hall. Hayden closed the bedroom door. Mr. Magee\nand the others stood silent, wondering. Their answer came quickly--the\nsharp cry of a revolver behind that closed door.\n\nIt was Mr. Magee who went into the bedroom. The moonlight streamed in\nthrough the low windows, and fell brightly on the bed. Across this\nHayden lay. Mr. Magee made sure. It was not a pleasant thing to make\nsure of. Then he took the revolver from the hand that still clasped it,\ncovered the quiet figure on the bed, and stepped back into the outer\nroom.\n\n\"He--he has killed himself,\" he said in a low voice, closing the bedroom\ndoor behind him.\n\nThere was a moment's frightened hush; then the voice of Kendrick rang\nout:\n\n\"Killed himself? I don't understand. Why should he do that? Surely not\nbecause--no--\" He looked questioningly into the white face of the girl\nat his side; she only shook her head. \"Killed himself,\" he repeated,\nlike a man wakened from sleep. \"I don't understand.\"\n\nOn tiptoe the amateur hermits of Baldpate descended to the hotel office.\nMr. Magee saw the eyes of the girl of the station upon him, wide with\ndoubt and alarm. While the others gathered in little groups and talked,\nhe took her to one side.\n\n\"When does the next train leave for Reuton?\" he asked her.\n\n\"In two hours--at ten-thirty,\" she replied.\n\n\"You must be on it,\" he told her. \"With you will go the\ntwo-hundred-thousand-dollar package. I have it in my pocket now.\"\n\nShe took the news stolidly, and made no reply.\n\n\"Are you afraid?\" asked Magee gently. \"You mustn't be. No harm can touch\nyou. I shall stay here and see that no one follows.\"\n\n\"I'm not afraid,\" she replied. \"Just startled, that's all. Did he--did\nhe do it because you took this money--because he was afraid of what\nwould happen?\"\n\n\"You mean Hayden?\" Magee said. \"No. This money was not concerned in--his\ndeath. That is an affair between Kendrick and him.\"\n\n\"I see,\" answered the girl slowly. \"I'm so glad it wasn't--the money. I\ncouldn't bear it if it were.\"\n\n\"May I call your attention,\" remarked Magee, \"to the fact that the long\nreign of 'I'm going to' is ended, and the rule of 'I've done it' has\nbegun? I've actually got the money. Somehow, it doesn't seem to thrill\nyou the way I thought it would.\"\n\n\"But it does--oh, it does!\" cried the girl. \"I was upset--for a moment.\nIt's glorious news And with you on guard here, I'm not afraid to carry\nit away--down the mountain--and to Reuton. I'll be with you in a moment,\nready for the journey.\"\n\nShe called Mrs. Norton and the two went rather timidly up-stairs\ntogether. Mr. Magee turned to his companions in the room, and mentally\ncalled their roll. They were all there, the professor, the mayor, Max,\nBland, Peters, Miss Thornhill, and the newcomer Kendrick, a man\nprematurely old, grayed at the temples, and with a face yellowed by\nfever. He and the professor were talking earnestly together, and now the\nold man came and stood before Magee.\n\n\"Mr. Magee,\" he said seriously, \"I learn from Kendrick that you have in\nyour possession a certain package of money that has been much buffeted\nabout here at Baldpate Inn. Now I suggest--no, I demand--\"\n\n\"Pardon me, Professor,\" Mr. Magee interrupted. \"I have something to\nsuggest--even to demand. It is that you, and every one else present,\nselect a chair and sit down. I suggest, though I do not demand, that you\npick comfortable chairs. For the vigil that you are about to begin will\nprove a long one.\"\n\n\"What d'you mean?\" asked the mayor of Reuton, coming militantly to\nProfessor Bolton's side.\n\nMagee did not reply. Miss Norton and her mother came down the stair, the\nformer wrapped in a great coat. She stood on the bottom step, her cheeks\nflushed, her eyes ablaze. Mr. Magee, going to her side, reflected that\nshe looked charming and wonderful, and wished he had time to admire. But\nhe hadn't. He took from one pocket the pistol he had removed from the\nhand of Hayden; from the other the celebrated package of money.\n\n\"I warn you all,\" he said, \"I will shoot any one who makes a move for\nthis bundle. Miss Norton is going to take it away with her--she is to\ncatch the ten-thirty train for Reuton. The train arrives at its\ndestination at twelve. Much as it pains me to say it, no one will leave\nthis room before twelve-fifteen.\"\n\n\"You--crook!\" roared Cargan.\n\nMr. Magee smiled as he put the package in the girl's hand.\n\n\"Possibly,\" he said. \"But, Mr. Cargan, the blackness of the kettle\nalways has annoyed the pot. Do not be afraid,\" he added to the girl.\n\"Every gentleman in this room is to spend the evening with me. You will\nnot be annoyed in any way.\" He looked around the menacing circle. \"Go,\"\nhe said, \"and may the gods of the mountain take care of you.\"\n\nThe little professor of Comparative Literature stepped forward and stood\npompously before Magee.\n\n\"One moment,\" he remarked. \"Before you steal this money in front of our\nvery eyes, I want to inform you who I am, and who I represent here.\"\n\n\"This is no time,\" replied Magee, \"for light talk on the subject of\nblondes.\"\n\n\"This is the time,\" said the professor warmly, \"for me to tell you that\nMr. Kendrick here and myself represent at Baldpate Inn the prosecuting\nattorney of Reuton county. We--\"\n\nCargan, big, red, volcanic, interrupted.\n\n\"Drayton,\" he bellowed. \"Drayton sent you here? The rat! The pup! Why, I\nmade that kid. I put him where he is. He won't dare touch me.\"\n\n\"Won't he?\" returned Professor Bolton. \"My dear sir, you are mistaken.\nDrayton fully intends to prosecute you on the ground that you arranged\nto pass Ordinance Number 45, granting the Suburban Railway the privilege\nof merging with the Civic, in exchange for this bribe of two hundred\nthousand dollars.\"\n\n\"He won't dare,\" cried Cargan. \"I made him.\"\n\n\"Before election,\" said the professor, \"I believe he often insisted to\nyou that he would do his duty as he saw it.\"\n\n\"Of course he did,\" replied Cargan. \"But that's what they all say.\"\n\n\"He intends to keep his word.\"\n\nThe mayor of Reuton slid into the shadows.\n\n\"To think he'd do this thing to me,\" he whined. \"After all I've done for\nhim.\"\n\n\"As I was saying, Mr. Magee,\" continued the professor, \"Mr. Kendrick and\nI came up here to secure this package of money as evidence against\nCargan and--the man above. I speak with the voice of the law when I say\nyou must turn this money over to me.\"\n\nFor answer Magee smiled at the girl.\n\n\"You'd better go now,\" he said. \"It's a long walk down the mountain.\"\n\n\"You refuse?\" cried the professor.\n\n\"Absolutely--don't we, Miss Norton?\" said Magee.\n\n\"Absolutely,\" she repeated bravely.\n\n\"Then, sir,\" announced the old man crushingly, \"you are little better\nthan a thief, and this girl is your accomplice.\"\n\n\"So it must look, on the face of it,\" assented Magee. The girl moved to\nthe big front door, and Magee, with his eyes still on the room, backed\naway until he stood beside her. He handed her his key.\n\n\"I give you,\" he said, \"to the gods of the mountain. But it's only a\nloan--I shall surely want you back. I can't follow ten feet behind, as I\nthreatened--it will be ten hours instead. Good night, and good luck.\"\n\nShe turned the key in the lock.\n\n\"Billy Magee,\" she whispered, \"yours is a faith beyond understanding. I\nshall tell the gods of the mountain that I am to be--returned. Good\nnight, you--dear.\"\n\nShe went out quickly, and Magee, locking the door after her, thrust the\nkey into his pocket. For a moment no one stirred. Then Mr. Max leaped up\nand ran through the flickering light to the nearest window.\n\nThere was a flash, a report, and Max came back into the firelight\nexamining a torn trousers leg.\n\n\"I don't mean to kill anybody,\" explained Mr. Magee. \"Just to wing them.\nBut I'm not an expert--I might shoot higher than I intend. So I suggest\nthat no one else try a break for it.\"\n\n\"Mr. Magee,\" said Miss Thornhill, \"I don't believe you have the\nslightest idea who that girl is, nor what she wants with the money.\"\n\n\"That,\" he replied, \"makes it all the more exciting, don't you think?\"\n\n\"Do you mean--\" the professor, exploded, \"you don't know her? Well, you\nyoung fool.\"\n\n\"It's rather fine of you,\" remarked Miss Thornhill.\n\n\"It's asinine, if it's true,\" the professor voiced the other side of it.\n\n\"You have said yourself--or at least you claim to have said--\" Mr. Magee\nreminded him, \"one girl like that is worth a million suffragettes.\"\n\n\"And can make just as much trouble,\" complained Professor Bolton. \"I\nshall certainly see to it that the hermit's book has an honored place in\nour college library.\"\n\nOut of the big chair into which he had sunk came the wail of the\nuncomprehending Cargan:\n\n\"He's done this thing to me--after all I've done for him.\"\n\n\"I hope every one is quite comfortable,\" remarked Mr. Magee, selecting a\nseat facing the crowd. \"It's to be a long wait, you know.\"\n\nThere was no answer. The wind roared lustily at the windows. The\nfirelight flickered redly on the faces of Mr. Magee's prisoners.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\nTHE PROFESSOR SUMS UP\n\n\nIn Upper Asquewan Falls the clock on the old town hall struck nine. Mr.\nMagee, on guard in Baldpate's dreary office, counted the strokes. She\nmust be half-way down the mountain now--perhaps at this very moment she\nheard Quimby's ancient gate creaking in the wind. He could almost see\nher as she tramped along through the snow, the lovely heroine of the\nmost romantic walk of all romantic walks on Baldpate to date. Half-way\nto the waiting-room where she had wept so bitterly; half-way to the\ncurious station agent with the mop of ginger hair. To-night there would\nbe no need of a troubadour to implore \"Weep no more, my lady\". William\nHallowell Magee had removed the cause for tears.\n\nIt was a long vigil he had begun, but there was no boredom in it for\nBilly Magee. He was too great a lover of contrast for that. As he looked\naround on the ill-assorted group he guarded, he compared them with the\nhappier people of the inn's summer nights, about whom the girl had told\nhim. Instead of these surly or sad folk sitting glumly under the pistol\nof romantic youth he saw maids garbed in the magic of muslin flit\nthrough the shadows. Lights glowed softly; a waltz came up from the\ncasino on the breath of the summer breeze. Under the red and white\nawnings youth and joy and love had their day--or their night. The hermit\nwas on hand with his postal-carded romance. The trees gossiped in\nwhispers on the mountain.\n\nAnd, too, the rocking-chair fleet gossiped in whispers on the veranda,\npausing only when the admiral sailed by in his glory. Eagerly it ran\ndown its game. This girl--this Myra Thornhill--he remembered, had\nherself been a victim. After Kendrick disappeared she had come there no\nmore, for there were ugly rumors of the man who had fled. Mr. Magee saw\nthe girl and her long-absent lover whispering together in the firelight;\nhe wondered if they, too, imagined themselves at Baldpate in the summer;\nif they heard the waltz in the casino, and the laughter of men in the\ngrill-room.\n\nTen o'clock, said the town hall pompously. She was at the station now.\nIn the room of her tears she was waiting; perhaps her only companion the\njacky of the \"See the World\" poster, whose garb was but a shade bluer\nthan her eyes. Who was she? What was the bribe money of the Suburban\nRailway to her? Mr. Magee did not know, but he trusted her, and he was\nglad she had won through him. He saw Professor Bolton walk through the\nflickering half-light to join Myra Thornhill and Kendrick.\n\nIt must be half past by now. Yes--from far below in the valley came the\nwhistle of a train. Now--she was boarding it. She and the money.\nBoarding it--for where? For what purpose? Again the train whistled.\n\n\"The siege,\" remarked Mr. Magee, \"is more than half over, ladies and\ngentlemen.\"\n\nThe professor of Comparative Literature approached him and took a chair\nat his side.\n\n\"I want to talk with you, Mr. Magee,\" he said.\n\n\"A welcome diversion,\" assented Magee, his eyes still on the room.\n\n\"I have discussed matters with Miss Thornhill,\" said the professor in a\nlow voice. \"She has convinced me that in this affair you have acted from\na wholly disinterested point of view. A mistaken idea of chivalry,\nperhaps. The infatuation of the moment for a pretty face--a thing to\nwhich all men with red blood in their veins are susceptible--a pleasant\nthing that I would be the last to want banished from the world.\"\n\n\"Miss Thornhill,\" replied Billy Magee, \"has sized up the situation\nperfectly--except for one rather important detail. It is not the\ninfatuation of the moment, Professor. Say rather that of a lifetime.\"\n\n\"Ah, yes,\" the old man returned. \"Youth--how sure it always is of that.\nI do not deprecate the feeling. Once, long ago, I, too, had youth and\nfaith. We will not dwell on that, however. Miss Thornhill assures me\nthat Henry Bentley, the son of my friend John Bentley, esteems you\nhighly. She asserts that you are in every respect, as far as her\nknowledge goes, an admirable young man. I feel sure that after calm\ncontemplation you will see that what you have done is very unfortunate.\nThe package of money which in a giddy moment you have given into a young\nlady's keeping is much desired by the authorities as evidence against a\nvery corrupt political ring. I am certain that when you know all the\ndetails you will be glad to return with me to Reuton and do all in your\npower to help us regain possession of that package.\"\n\nAnd now the town hall informed Mr. Magee that the hour was eleven. He\npictured a train flying like a black shadow through the white night. Was\nshe on it--safe?\n\n\"Professor Bolton,\" he said, \"there couldn't possibly be any one\nanywhere more eager than I to learn all the details of this affair--to\nhear your real reason for coming to Baldpate Inn, and to have the\nperoxide-blond incident properly classified and given its niche in\nhistory. But let me tell you again my action of to-night was no mere\nmadness of the moment. I shall stick to it through thick and thin. Now,\nabout the blondes.\"\n\n\"The blondes,\" repeated the professor dreamily. \"Ah, yes, I must make a\nsmall confession of guilt there. I did not come here to escape the\nresults of that indiscreet remark, but I really made it--about a year\nago. Shall I ever forget? Hardly--the newspapers and my wife won't let\nme. I can never again win a new honor, however dignified, without being\nreferred to in print as the peroxide-blond advocate. The thing has made\nme furious. However, I did not come to Baldpate Inn to avoid the results\nof a lying newspaper story, though many a time, a year ago, when I\nstarted to leave my house and saw the reporters camped on my door-step,\nI longed for the seclusion of some such spot as this. On the night when\nMr. Kendrick and I climbed Baldpate Mountain, I remarked as much to him.\nAnd so it occurred to me that if I found any need of explaining my\npresence here, the blond incident would do very well. It was only--a\nwhite lie.\"\n\n\"A blond one,\" corrected Mr. Magee. \"I forgive you, Professor. And I'm\nmighty glad the incident really happened, despite the pain it caused\nyou. For it in a way condones my own offense--and it makes you human,\ntoo.\"\n\n\"If to err is human, it does,\" agreed Professor Bolton. \"To begin with,\nI am a member of the faculty of the University of Reuton, situated, as\nyou no doubt know, in the city of the same name. For a long time I have\ntaken a quiet interest in our municipal politics. I have been up in\narms--linguistic arms--against this odd character Cargan, who came from\nthe slums to rule us with a rod of iron. Every one knows he is corrupt,\nthat he is wealthy through the sale of privilege, that there is actually\na fixed schedule of prices for favors in the way of city ordinances. I\nhave often denounced him to my friends. Since I have met him--well, it\nis remarkable, is it not, the effect of personality on one's opinions? I\nexpected to face a devil, with the usual appurtenances. Instead I have\nfound a human, rather likable man. I can well understand now why it is\nthat the mob follows him like sheep. However, that is neither here nor\nthere. He is a crook, and must be punished--even though I do like him\nimmensely.\"\n\nMr. Magee smiled over to where the great bulk of Cargan slouched in a\nchair.\n\n\"He's a bully old scout,\" he remarked.\n\n\"Even so,\" replied the professor, \"his high-handed career of graft in\nReuton must come to a speedy close. He is of a type fast vanishing\nthrough the awakening public conscience. And his career will end, I\nassure you, despite the fact that you, Mr. Magee, have seen fit to send\nour evidence scurrying through the night at the behest of a chit of a\ngirl. I beg your pardon--I shall continue. Young Drayton, the new county\nprosecutor, was several years back a favorite pupil of mine. After he\nleft law school he fell under the spell of the picturesque mayor of\nReuton. Cargan liked him and he rose rapidly. Drayton had no thought of\never turning against his benefactor when he accepted the first favors,\nbut later the open selling of men's souls began to disgust him. When\nCargan offered him the place of prosecutor, a few months ago, Drayton\nassured him that he would keep his oath of office. The mayor laughed.\nDrayton insisted. Cargan had not yet met the man he could not handle. He\ngave Drayton the place.\"\n\nThe old man leaned forward, and tapped Magee on the knee.\n\n\"It was in me, remember,\" he went on, \"that Drayton confided his resolve\nto serve the public. I was delighted at the news. A few weeks ago he\ninformed me his first opportunity was at hand. Through one of the men in\nhis office he had learned that Hayden of the Suburban Electric was\nseeking to consolidate that road, which had fallen into partial\ndisrepute under his management during the illness of Thornhill, the\npresident, with the Civic. The consolidation would raise the value of\nthe Suburban nearly two million dollars--at the public's expense. Hayden\nhad seen Cargan. Cargan had drafted Ordinance Number 45, and informed\nHayden that his price for passing it through the council would be the\nsum you have juggled in your possession on Baldpate Mountain--two\nhundred thousand dollars.\"\n\n\"A mere trifle,\" remarked Magee sarcastically.\n\n\"So Cargan made Hayden see. Through long experience in these matters the\nmayor has become careless. He is the thing above the law, if not the law\nitself. He would have had no fear in accepting this money on Main Street\nat midday. He had no fear when he came here and found he was being spied\non.\n\n\"But Hayden--there was the difficulty that began the drama of Baldpate\nInn. Hayden had few scruples, but as events to-night have well proved,\nMr. Magee, he was a coward at heart. I do not know just why he lies on\nyour bed up-stairs at this moment, a suicide--that is a matter between\nKendrick and him, and one which Kendrick himself has not yet fathomed.\nAs I say, Hayden was afraid of being caught. Andy Rutter, manager of\nBaldpate Inn for the last few summers, is in some way mixed up in the\nSuburban. It was he who suggested to Hayden that an absolutely secluded\nspot for passing this large sum of money would be the inn. The idea\nappealed to Hayden. Cargan tried to laugh him out of it. The mayor did\nnot relish the thought of a visit to Baldpate Mountain in the dead of\nwinter, particularly as he considered such precautions unnecessary. But\nHayden was firm; this spot, he pointed out, was ideal, and the mayor at\nlast laughingly gave in. The sum involved was well worth taking a little\ntrouble to gain.\"\n\nProfessor Bolton paused, and blinked his dim old eyes.\n\n\"So the matter was arranged,\" he continued. \"Mr. Bland, a clerk in\nHayden's employ, was sent up here with the money, which he placed in the\nsafe on the very night of our arrival. The safe had been left open by\nRutter; Bland did not have the combination. He put the package inside,\nswung shut the door, and awaited the arrival of the mayor.\"\n\n\"I was present,\" smiled Magee, \"at the ceremony you mention.\"\n\n\"Yes? All these plans, as I have said, were known to Drayton. A few\nnights ago he came to me. He wanted to send an emissary to Baldpate--a\nman whom Cargan had never met--one who could perhaps keep up the\npretense of being here for some other reason than a connection with the\nbribe. He asked me to undertake the mission, to see all I could, and if\npossible to secure the package of money. This last seemed hardly likely.\nAt any rate, I was to gather all the evidence I could. I hesitated. My\nlibrary fire never looked so alluring as on that night. Also, I was\nengaged in some very entertaining researches.\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon?\" said Billy Magee.\n\n\"Some very entertaining research work.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" reflected Magee slowly, \"I suppose such things do exist. Go on,\nplease.\"\n\n\"I had loudly proclaimed my championship of civic virtue, however, and\nhere was a chance to serve Reuton. I acquiesced. The day I was to start\nup here, poor Kendrick came back. He, too, had been a student of mine; a\nfriend of both Drayton and Hayden. Seven years ago he and Hayden were\nrunning the Suburban together, under Thornhill's direction. The two\nyoung men became mixed up in a rather shady business deal, which was\nmore of Hayden's weaving than Kendrick's. Hayden came to Kendrick with\nthe story that they were about to be found out, and suggested that one\nassume the blame and go away. I am telling you all this in confidence as\na friend of my friends, the Bentleys, and a young man whom I like and\ntrust despite your momentary madness in the matter of yellow locks--we\nare all susceptible.\n\n\"Kendrick went. For seven years he stayed away, in an impossible tropic\ntown, believing himself sought by the law, for so Hayden wrote him. Not\nlong ago he discovered that the matter in which he and Hayden had\noffended had never been disclosed after all. He hurried back to the\nstates. You can imagine his bitterness. He had been engaged to Myra\nThornhill, and the fact that Hayden was also in love with her may have\nhad something to do with his treachery to his friend.\"\n\nMagee's eyes strayed to where the two victims of the dead man's\nfalsehood whispered together in the shadows, and he wondered at the\ncalmness with which Kendrick had greeted Hayden in the room above.\n\n\"When Kendrick arrived,\" Professor Bolton went on, \"first of all he\nconsulted his old friend Drayton. Drayton informed him that he had\nnothing to fear should his misstep be made public, for in reality there\nwas, at this late day, no crime committed in the eyes of the law. He\nalso told Kendrick how matters stood, and of the net he was spreading\nfor Hayden. He had some fears, he said, about sending a man of my years\nalone to Baldpate Inn. Kendrick begged for the chance to come, too. So,\nwithout making his return known in Reuton, three nights ago he\naccompanied me here. Three nights--it seems years. I had secured keys\nfor us both from John Bentley. As we climbed the mountain, I noticed\nyour light, and we agreed it would be best if only one of us revealed\nourselves to the intruders in the inn. So Kendrick let himself in by a\nside door while I engaged you and Bland in the office. He spent the\nnight on the third floor. In the morning I told the whole affair to\nQuimby, knowing his interest in both Hayden and Kendrick, and secured\nfor Kendrick the key to the annex. Almost as soon as I arrived--\"\n\n\"The curtain went up on the melodrama,\" suggested Mr. Magee.\n\n\"You state it vividly and with truth,\" Professor Bolton replied. \"Night\nbefore last the ordinance numbered 45 was due to pass the council. It\nwas arranged that when it did, Hayden, through his man Rutter, or\npersonally, would telephone the combination of the safe to the mayor of\nReuton. Cargan and Bland sat in the office watching for the flash of\nlight at the telephone switchboard, while you and I were Max's prisoners\nabove. Something went wrong. Hayden heard that the courts would issue an\ninjunction making Ordinance Number 45 worthless. So, although the\ncouncil obeyed Cargan's instructions and passed the bill, Hayden refused\nto give the mayor the combination.\"\n\nThe old man paused and shook his head wonderingly.\n\n\"Then melodrama began in dead earnest,\" he continued. \"I have always\nbeen a man of peace, and the wild scuffle that claimed me for one of its\nleading actors from that moment will remain in my memory as long as I\nlive. Cargan dynamited the safe. Kendrick held him up; you held up\nKendrick. I peeked through your window and saw you place the package of\nmoney under a brick in your fireplace--\"\n\n\"You--the curtains were down,\" interrupted Magee.\n\n\"I found a half-inch of open space,\" explained the old man. \"Yes, I\nactually lay on my stomach in the snow and watched you. In the morning,\nfor the first time in my life, I committed robbery. My punishment was\nswift and sure. Bland swooped down upon me. Again this afternoon, I came\nupon the precious package, after a long search, in the hands of the\nHermit of Baldpate. I thought we were safe at last when I handed the\npackage to Kendrick in my room to-night--but I had not counted on the\nwild things a youth like you will do for love of a designing maid.\"\n\nTwelve o'clock! The civic center of Upper Asquewan Falls proclaimed it.\nMr. Magee had never been in Reuton. He was sorry he hadn't. He had to\nconstruct from imagination alone the great Reuton station through which\nthe girl and the money must now be hurrying--where? The question would\nnot down. Was she--as the professor believed--designing?\n\n\"No,\" said Mr. Magee, answering aloud his own question. \"You are wrong,\nsir. I do not know just what the motives of Miss Norton were in desiring\nthis money, but I will stake my reputation as an honest hold-up man that\nthey were perfectly all right.\"\n\n\"Perhaps,\" replied the other, quite unconvinced. \"But--what honest\nmotive could she have? I am able to assign her no r\u00c3\u00b4le in this little\ndrama. I have tried. I am able to see no connection between her and the\nother characters. What--\"\n\n\"Pardon me,\" broke in Magee. \"But would you mind telling me why Miss\nThornhill came up to Baldpate to join in the chase for the package?\"\n\n\"Her motive,\" replied the professor, \"does her great credit. For several\nyears her father, Henry Thornhill, has been forced through illness to\nleave the management of the railway's affairs to his vice-president,\nHayden. Late yesterday the old man heard of this proposed bribe--on his\nsick bed. He was very nearly insane at the thought of the disgrace it\nwould bring upon him. He tried to rise himself and prevent the passing\nof the package. His daughter--a brave loyal girl--herself undertook the\ntask.\"\n\n\"Then,\" said Mr. Magee, \"Miss Thornhill is not distressed at the loss of\nthe most important evidence in the case.\"\n\n\"I have explained the matter to her,\" returned Professor Bolton. \"There\nis no chance whatever that her father's name will be implicated. Both\nDrayton and myself have the highest regard for his integrity. The whole\naffair was arranged when he was too ill to dream of it. His good name\nwill be smirched in no way. The only man involved on the giver's side is\ndead in the room above. The man we are after now is Cargan. Miss\nThornhill has agreed that it is best to prosecute. That eliminates her.\"\n\n\"Did Miss Thornhill and Kendrick meet for the first time, after his\nexile, up-stairs--in number seven?\" Mr. Magee wanted to know.\n\n\"Yes,\" answered Professor Bolton. \"In one of his letters long ago Hayden\ntold Kendrick he was engaged to the girl. It was the last letter\nKendrick received from him.\"\n\nThere was a pause.\n\n\"The important point now,\" the old man went on, \"is the identity of this\ngirl to whom you have made your princely gift, out of the goodness of\nyour young heart. I propose to speak to the woman she has introduced as\nher mother, and elicit what information I can.\"\n\nHe crossed the floor, followed by Mr. Magee, and stood by the woman's\nchair. She looked up, her eyes heavy with sleep, her appearance more\ntawdry than ever in that faint light.\n\n\"Madam,\" remarked the professor, with the air of a judge trying a case,\n\"your daughter has to-night made her escape from this place with a large\nsum of money earnestly desired by the prosecuting attorney of Reuton\ncounty. In the name of the law, I command you to tell me her\ndestination, and what she proposes to do with that package of\ngreenbacks.\"\n\nThe woman blinked stupidly in the dusk.\n\n\"She ain't my daughter,\" she replied, and Mr. Magee's heart leaped up.\n\"I can tell you that much. I keep a boarding-house in Reuton and\nMiss--the girl you speak about--has been my boarder for three years. She\nbrought me up here as a sort of chaperon, though I don't see as I'm old\nenough for that yet. You don't get nothing else out of me--except that\nshe is a perfectly lovely young woman, and your money couldn't be safer\nwith the president of the United States.\"\n\nThe puzzled professor of Comparative Literature caressed his bald head\nthoughtfully. \"I--er--\" he remarked. Mr. Magee could have embraced this\nfaded woman for her news. He looked at his watch. It was twelve-twenty.\n\n\"The siege is over,\" he cried. \"I shall not attempt to direct your\nactions any longer. Mr. Peters, will you please go down to the village\nand bring back Mr. Quimby and--the coroner?\"\n\n\"The coroner!\" The mayor of Reuton jumped to his feet. \"I don't want to\nbe in on any inquest scene. Come on, Max, let's get out of here.\"\n\nBland stood up, his face was white and worried, his gay plumage no\nlonger set the tone for his mood.\n\n\"I think I'll go, too,\" he announced, looking hopefully at Magee.\n\n\"I'm no longer your jailer,\" Magee said. \"Professor, these gentlemen are\nyour witnesses Do you wish to detain them?\"\n\n\"See here,\" cried the mayor angrily, \"there ain't no question but that\nyou can find me in Reuton any time you want me. At the little room on\nMain Street--anybody can tell you my hours--the door's always open to\nany reformer that has the nerve to climb the stairs. Look me up there.\nI'll make it interesting for you.\"\n\n\"I certainly shall,\" the professor replied. \"And very soon. Until then\nyou may go when and where you please.\"\n\n\"Thanks,\" sneered the mayor. \"I'll expect you. I'll be ready. I've had\nto get ready to answer your kind before. You think you got me, eh? Well,\nyou're a fool to think that. As for Drayton, the pup, the\nyellow-streaked pup--I'll talk to Mister Drayton when I get back to\nReuton.\"\n\n\"Before you go, Bland,\" remarked Magee, smiling, \"I want to ask about\nArabella. Where did you get her?\"\n\n\"Some of it happened to a friend of mine,\" the ex-haberdasher answered,\n\"a friend that keeps a clothing store. I got this suit there. I changed\nthe story, here and there. He didn't write her no note, though he\nthought seriously of it. And he didn't run away and hide. The last I\nseen of him he was testing the effect of the heart-balm on sale behind\nthe swinging doors.\"\n\nMr. Magee laughed, but over the long lean face of Bland not the ghost of\na smile flitted. He was frightened, through and through.\n\n\"You're a fine bunch,\" sneered Mr. Max. \"Reformers, eh? Well, you'll get\nwhat the rest of 'em always got. We'll tie you up in knots and leave you\non the door-step of some orphan asylum before we're through with you.\"\n\n\"Come on, Lou,\" said Cargan. \"Drayton's a smart guy, Doc. Where's his\nproof? Eloped with the bundle of dry goods this young man's taken a\nfancy to. And even if he had the money--I've been up against this many a\ntime. You're wasting your talents, Doc. Good night! Come on, boys.\"\n\nThe three stamped out through the dining-room, and from the window Mr.\nMagee watched them disappear down the road that stretched to Asquewan\nFalls.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\nA RED CARD\n\n\nMr. Magee turned back from the window to the dim interior of the hotel\noffice. He who had come to Baldpate Inn to court loneliness had never\nfelt so lonely in his life. For he had lost sight of her--in the great\nReuton station of his imagination she had slipped from his dreams--to go\nwhere he could not follow, even in thought. He felt as he knew this\ngreat bare room must feel each fall when the last laugh died away down\nthe mountain, and the gloom of winter descended from drab skies.\n\nSelecting a log of the hermit's cutting from the stock beside the\nhearth, Mr. Magee tossed it on the fire. There followed a shower of\nsparks and a flood of red light in the room. Through this light Kendrick\nadvanced to Magee's side, and the first of the Baldpate hermits saw that\nthe man's face was lined by care, that his eyes were tired even under\nthe new light in them, that his mouth was twisted bitterly.\n\n\"Poor devil,\" thought Magee.\n\nKendrick drew up chairs for himself and Magee, and they sat down. Behind\nthem the bulky Mrs. Norton dozed, dreaming perhaps of her Reuton\nboarding-house, while Miss Thornhill and the professor talked\nintermittently in low tones. The ranks at Baldpate were thinning\nrapidly; before long the place must settle back with a sigh in the cold,\nto wait for its first summer girl.\n\n\"Mr. Magee,\" said Kendrick nervously, \"you have become involved in an\nunkind, a tragic story. I do not mean the affair of the bribe--I refer\nto the matter between Hayden and myself. Before Peters comes back\nwith--the men he went for--I should like to tell you some of the facts\nof that story.\"\n\n\"If you had rather not--\" began Magee.\n\n\"No,\" replied Kendrick, \"I prefer that you should know. It was you who\ntook the pistol from--his hand. I do not believe that even I can tell\nyou all that was in Hayden's mind when he went into that other room and\nclosed the door. It seems to me preposterous that a man of his sort\nshould take his life under the circumstances I feel, somehow, that there\nis a part of the story even I do not know. But let that be.\"\n\nHe bowed his head in his hands.\n\n\"Ever since I came into this room,\" he went on, \"the eyes of a pompous\nlittle man have been following me about. They have constantly recalled\nto me the nightmare of my life. You have noticed, no doubt, the pictures\nof the admiral that decorate these walls?\"\n\n\"I have,\" replied Magee. He gazed curiously at the nearest of the\nportraits. How persistently this almost mythical starched man wove in\nand out of the melodrama at Baldpate Inn.\n\n\"Well,\" continued Kendrick, \"the admiral's eyes haunt me. Perhaps you\nknow that he plays a game--a game of solitaire. I have good reason to\nremember that game. It is a silly inconsequential game. You would\nscarcely believe that it once sent a man to hell.\"\n\nHe stopped.\n\n\"I am beginning in the middle of my story,\" he apologized. \"Let me go\nback. Six years ago I was hardly the man you see now--I was at least\ntwenty years younger. Hayden and I worked together in the office of the\nSuburban Railway. We had been close friends at college--I believed in\nhim and trusted him, although I knew he had certain weaknesses. I was a\nhappy man. I had risen rapidly, I was young, the future was lying golden\nbefore me--and I was engaged. The daughter of Henry Thornhill, our\nemployer--the girl you have met here at Baldpate--had promised to be my\nwife. Hayden had also been a suitor, but when our engagement was\nannounced he came to me like a man, and I thought his words were\nsincere.\n\n\"One day Hayden told me of a chance we might take which would make us\nrich. It was not--altogether within the law. But it was the sort of\nthing that other men were doing constantly, and Hayden assured me that\nas he had arranged matters it was absolutely safe. My great sin is that\nI agreed we should take the chance--a sin for which I have paid, Mr.\nMagee, over and over.\"\n\nAgain he paused, and gazed steadily at the fire. Again Magee noted the\ngray at his temples, the aftermath of fevers in his cheeks.\n\n\"We--took the chance,\" he went on. \"For a time everything went well.\nThen--one blustering March night--Hayden came to me and told me we were\ncertain to be caught. Some of his plans had gone awry. I trusted him\nfully at the time, you understand--he was the man with whom I had sat on\nthe window-seat of my room at college, settling the question of\nimmortality, and all the other great questions young men settle at such\ntimes. I have at this moment no doubt that he was quite truthful when he\nsaid we were in danger of arrest. We arranged to meet the next night at\nthe Argots Club and decide on what we should do.\n\n\"We met--in the library of the club. Hayden came in to me from the\ncard-room adjoining, where he had been watching the admiral doddering\nover his eternal game. The old man had become a fixture at the club,\nlike Parker down at the door, or the great chandelier in the hall. No\none paid any attention to him; when he tried to talk to the younger men\nabout his game they fled as from a pestilence. Well, as I say, Hayden\ncame to meet me, and just at that moment the admiral finished his game\nand went out. We were alone in the library.\n\n\"Hayden told me he had thought the matter over carefully. There was\nnothing to do but to clear out of Reuton forever. But why, he argued,\nshould we both go? Why wreck two lives? It would be far better, he told\nme, for one to assume the guilt of both and go away. I can see him\nnow--how funny and white his face looked in that half-lighted room--how\nhis hands trembled. I was far the calmer of the two.\n\n\"I agreed to his plan. Hayden led the way into the room where the\nadmiral had been playing. We went up to the table, over which the\ngreen-shaded light still burned. On it lay two decks of cards, face up.\nHayden picked up the nearest deck, and shuffled it nervously. His\nface--God, it was like the snow out there on the mountain.\"\n\nKendrick closed his eyes, and Magee gazed at him in silent pity.\n\n\"He held out the deck,\" went on the exile softly, \"he told me to draw.\nHe said if the card was black, he'd clear out. 'But if it's red, David,'\nhe said, 'why--you--got to go.' I held my breath, and drew. It was a\nfull minute before I dared look at the card in my hand. Then I turned it\nover and it was--red--a measly little red two-spot. I don't suppose a\nman ever realizes all at once what such a moment means. I remember that\nI was much cooler than Hayden. It was I who had to brace him up. I--I\neven tried to joke with him. But his face was like death. He hardly\nspoke at all at first, and then suddenly he became horribly talkative. I\nleft him--talking wildly--I left Reuton. I left the girl to whom I was\nengaged.\"\n\nTo break the silence that followed, Mr. Magee leaned forward and stirred\nthe logs.\n\n\"I don't want to bore you,\" Kendrick said, trying to smile. \"I went to a\nlittle town in South America. There was no treaty of extradition\nthere--nor anything else civilized and decent. I smoked cigarettes and\ndrank what passed for rum, on the balcony of an impossible hotel, and\notherwise groped about for the path that leads to the devil. After a\nyear, I wrote to Hayden. He answered, urging me to stay away. He\nintimated that the thing we had done was on my shoulders. I was ashamed,\nfrightfully unhappy. I didn't dare write to--her. I had disgraced her. I\nasked Hayden about her, and he wrote back that she was shortly to marry\nhim. After that I didn't want to come back to Reuton. I wanted most--to\ndie.\n\n\"The years crept by on the balcony of that impossible hotel. Six of\nthem. The first in bitter memories, memories of a red card that danced\nfiendishly before my eyes when I closed them--the last in a fierce\nbiting desire to come back to the world I had left. At last, a few\nmonths ago, I wrote to another college friend of mine, Drayton, and told\nhim the whole story. I did not know that he had been elected prosecutor\nin Reuton. He answered with a kind pitying letter--and finally I knew\nthe horrible truth. Nothing had ever happened. The thing we had done had\nnever been discovered. Hayden had lied. He had even lied about his\nengagement to Myra Thornhill. There, he had made a reality out of what\nwas simply his great desire.\n\n\"You can imagine my feelings. Six years in a tomb, a comic opera sort of\ntomb, where a silly surf was forever pounding, and foolish palms kept\nwaving. Six years--for nothing. Six years, while Hayden, guiltier than\nI, stayed behind to enjoy the good things of life, to plead for the girl\nwhose lover he had banished.\n\n\"I lost no time in coming north. Three days ago I entered Drayton's\noffice. I was ready and willing that the wrong Hayden and I had done\nshould be made public. Drayton informed me that legally there had been\nno crime, that Hayden had straightened things out in time, that we had\ndefrauded no one. And he told me that for whatever sin I had committed\nhe thought I had more than atoned down there in that town that God\nforgot. I think I had. He explained to me about the trap he had laid for\nHayden up here at Baldpate Inn. I begged to help. What happened after,\nyou know as well as I.\"\n\n\"Yes, I think I do,\" agreed Mr. Magee softly.\n\n\"I have told you the whole story,\" Kendrick replied, \"and yet it seems\nto me that still it is not all told. Why should Hayden have killed\nhimself? He had lied to me, it is true, but life was always sweet to\nhim, and it hardly seems to me that he was the sort to die simply\nbecause his falsehood was discovered. Was there some other act of\ncruelty--some side to the story of which we are none of us aware? I\nwonder.\"\n\nHe was silent a moment.\n\n\"Anyhow, I have told you all I know,\" he said. \"Shall I tell it also to\nthe coroner? Or shall we allow Hayden's suicide to pass as the result of\nhis implication in this attempt at bribery? I ask your advice, Mr.\nMagee.\"\n\n\"My advice,\" returned Magee, \"is that you befuddle no pompous little\nvillage doctor with the complication of this unhappy tale. No, let the\nstory be that Hayden killed himself as the toils closed in on him--the\ntoils of the law that punishes the bribe giver--now and then and\noccasionally. Mr. Kendrick, you have my deepest sympathy. Is it too much\nfor me to hope\"--he glanced across the room to where Myra Thornhill sat\nbeside the professor--\"that the best of your life is yet to come--that\nout of the wreck this man made of it you may yet be happy?\"\n\nKendrick smiled.\n\n\"You are very kind,\" he said. \"Twice we have met and battled in the\nsnow, and I do not hold it against you that both times you were the\nvictor. Life in a tropic town, Mr. Magee, is not exactly a\nmuscle-building experience. Once I might have given the whole proceeding\na different turn. Yes, Miss Thornhill has waited for me--all these\nyears--waited, believing. It is a loyalty of which I can not speak\nwithout--you understand. She knows why I went away--why I stayed away.\nShe is still ready to marry me. I shall go again into the Suburban\noffice and try to lift the road from the muck into which it has fallen.\nYes, it is not too much for me to hope--and for you in your\nkindness--that a great happiness is still for me.\"\n\n\"Believe me, I'm glad,\" replied Magee with youthful enthusiasm, holding\nout his hand. \"I'm sorry I spoiled your little game up here, but--\"\n\n\"I understand,\" smiled Kendrick. \"I think none the less of you for what\nyou have done. And who knows? It may turn out to have been the wisest\ncourse after all.\"\n\nAh, would it? Mr. Magee walked to the window, pondering on the odd\ntangle of events that had not yet been completely straightened out.\nCertainly her eyes were an honest blue as well as a beautiful--but who\nwas she? Where was she? The great figure of Mrs. Norton stirred\nrestlessly near at hand; the puffed lids of her eyes opened.\n\n\"Mr. Magee,\" she said, when she had made out his figure by the window,\n\"you've been a true friend, as I might say, to a couple of mad females\nwho ought to have been at home by their own firesides, and I'm going to\nask one more favor of you. Find out when the next train goes to Reuton,\nand see that I'm at the station an hour or two before it pulls out.\"\n\n\"I'll do that, Mrs. Norton,\" smiled Magee. \"By the way, is Norton the\nname?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" answered the woman, \"that's my name. Of course, it ain't hers. I\ncan't tell that.\"\n\n\"No matter,\" said Mr. Magee, \"she'll probably change it soon. Can't you\ntell me something about her--just a tiny bit of information. Just a\npicture of where she is now, and what she's doing with that small\nfortune I gave her.\"\n\n\"Where is she now?\" repeated Mrs. Norton. \"She's home and in bed in my\nsecond floor front, unless she's gone clear crazy. And that's where I\nwish I was this minute--in bed--though it's a question in my mind if\nI'll ever be able to sleep again, what with the uproar and confusion my\nhouse is probably in by this time, leaving it in charge of a\nscatter-brained girl. Norton always used to say if you want a thing done\nright, do it yourself, and though he didn't always live up to the\nsentiment, letting me do most things he wanted done right, there was a\nlot of truth in his words. I certainly must get back to Reuton, just as\nquick as the railroad will take me.\"\n\n\"Why did you come?\" prodded Mr. Magee. \"Why did you leave your house on\nthis strange mission?\"\n\n\"The Lord knows,\" replied the woman. \"I certainly never intended to, but\nshe begged and pleaded, and the first thing I knew, I was on a train.\nShe has winning ways, that girl--maybe you've noticed?\"\n\n\"I have,\" assented Billy Magee.\n\n\"I thought so. No, Mr. Magee, I can't tell you nothing about her. I\nain't allowed to--even you that has been so kind. She made me promise.\n'He'll know soon enough,' she kept saying. But I will tell you, as I\ntold you before, there's no occasion to worry about her--unless you was\nto think was she held up and murdered with all that money on her, the\nbrave little dear. If you was considering offering yourself for the job\nof changing her name, Mr. Magee, I say go in and do it. It sure is time\nshe settled down and gave up this--this--gave it all up before something\nawful happens to her. You won't forget--the very next train, Mr. Magee?\"\n\n\"The very next,\" Magee agreed.\n\nIn through the dining-room door stamped Quimby, grave of face, dazed at\nbeing roused from sleep, and with him an important little man whose duty\nit was to investigate at Upper Asquewan Falls such things as had\nhappened that night at Baldpate. Even from his slumber he rose with the\nair of a judge and the manner of a Sherlock Holmes. For an hour he asked\nquestions, and in the end he prepared to go in a seemingly satisfied\nstate of mind.\n\nQuimby's face was very awed when he came down-stairs after a visit to\nthe room above.\n\n\"Poor fellow!\" he said to Magee. \"I'm sorry--he was so young.\" For such\nas Quimby carry no feud beyond the gates. He went over and took\nKendrick's hand.\n\n\"I never had a chance,\" he said, \"to thank you for all you tried to do\nfor me and my invention.\"\n\n\"And it came to nothing in the end?\" Kendrick asked.\n\n\"Nothing,\" Quimby answered. \"I--I had to creep back to Baldpate Mountain\nfinally--broke and discouraged. I have been here ever since. All my blue\nprints, all my models--they're locked away forever in a chest up in the\nattic.\"\n\n\"Not forever, Quimby,\" Kendrick replied. \"I always did believe in your\ninvention--I believe in it still. When I get back into the harness--I'm\nsure I can do something for you.\"\n\nQuimby shook his head. He looked to be half asleep.\n\n\"It don't seem possible,\" he said. \"No--it's all been buried so\nlong--all the hope--all the plans--it don't seem possible it could ever\ncome to life again.\"\n\n\"But it can, and it will,\" cried Kendrick. \"I'm going to lay a stretch\nof track in Reuton with your joints. That's all you need--they'll have\nto use 'em then. We'll force the Civic into it. We can do it, Quimby--we\nsurely can.\"\n\nQuimby rubbed his hand across his eyes.\n\n\"You'll lay a stretch of track--\" he repeated. \"That's great news to me,\nMr. Kendrick. I--I can't thank you now.\" His voice was husky. \"I'll come\nback and take care of--him,\" he said, jerking his head toward the room\nup-stairs. \"I got to go now--this minute--I got to go and tell my wife.\nI got to tell her what you've said.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX\n\nEXEUNT OMNES, AS SHAKESPEARE HAS IT\n\n\nAt four in the morning Baldpate Inn, wrapped in the arms of winter, had\nall the rare gaiety and charm of a baseball bleechers on Christmas Eve.\nLooking gloomily out the window, Mr. Magee heard behind him the steps on\nthe stairs and the low cautions of Quimby, and two men he had brought\nfrom the village, who were carrying something down to the dark carriage\nthat waited outside. He did not look round. It was a picture he wished\nto avoid.\n\nSo this was the end--the end of his two and a half days of solitude--the\nend of his light-hearted exile on Baldpate Mountain. He thought of\nBland, lean and white of face, gay of garb, fleeing through the night,\nhis Arabella fiction disowned in the real tragedy that had followed. He\nthought of Cargan and Max, also fleeing, wrathful, sneering, by Bland's\nside. He thought of Hayden, jolting down the mountain in that black\nwagon. So it ended.\n\nSo it ended--most preposterous end--with William Hallowell Magee madly,\ndesperately, in love. By the gods--in love! In love with a fair\ngay-hearted girl for whom he had fought, and stolen, and snapped his\nfingers at the law as it blinked at him in the person of Professor\nBolton. Billy Magee, the calm, the unsusceptible, who wrote of a popular\ncupid but had always steered clear of his shots. In love with a girl\nwhose name he did not know; whose motives were mostly in the fog. And he\nhad come up here--to be alone.\n\nFor the first time in many hours he thought of New York, of the fellows\nat the club, of what they would say when the jocund news came that Billy\nMagee had gone mad on a mountainside, He thought of Helen Faulkner,\nhaughty, unperturbed, bred to hold herself above the swift catastrophies\nof the world. He could see the arch of her patrician eyebrows, the shrug\nof her exquisite shoulders, when young Williams hastened up the avenue\nand poured into her ear the merry story. Well--so be it. He had never\ncared for her. In her superiority he had found a challenge, in her icy\nindifference a trap, that lured him on to try his hand at winning her.\nBut he had never for a moment caught a glimmering of what it was really\nto care--to care as he cared now for the girl who had gone from\nhim--somewhere--down the mountain.\n\nQuimby dragged into the room, the strain of a rather wild night in Upper\nAsquewan Falls in his eyes.\n\n\"Jake Peters asked me to tell you he ain't coming back,\" he said. \"Mis'\nQuimby is getting breakfast for you down at our house. You better pack\nup now and start down, I reckon. Your train goes at half past six.\"\n\nMrs. Norton jumped up, proclaiming that she must be aboard that train at\nany cost. Miss Thornhill, the professor and Kendrick ascended the\nstairs, and in a moment Magee followed.\n\nHe stepped softly into number seven, for the tragedy of the rooms was\nstill in the air. Vague shapes seemed to flit about him as he lighted a\ncandle. They whispered in his ear that this was to have been the scene\nof achievement; that here he was to have written the book that should\nmake his place secure. Ah, well, fate had decreed it otherwise. It had\nset plump in his path the melodrama he had come up to Baldpate to avoid.\nIronic fate, she must be laughing now in the sleeve of her kimono.\nFeeling about in the shadows Magee gathered his things together, put\nthem in his bags, and with a last look at number seven, closed the door\nforever on its many excitements.\n\nA shivering group awaited him at the foot of the stair. Mrs. Norton's\nhat was on at an angle even the most imaginative milliner could not have\napproved. The professor looked older than ever; even Miss Thornhill\nseemed a little less statuesque and handsome in the dusk. Quimby led the\nway to the door, they passed through it, and Mr. Magee locked it after\nthem with the key Hal Bentley had blithely given him on Forty-fourth\nStreet, New York.\n\nSo Baldpate Inn dropped back into the silence to slumber and to wait. To\nwait for the magic of muslin, the lilt of waltzes, the tinkle of\nlaughter, the rhythm of the rockers of the fleet on its verandas, the\nformal tread of the admiral's boots across its polished floors, the\nclink of dimes in the pockets of its bell-boys. For a few brief hours\nstrange figures had replaced the unromantic Quimby in its rooms, they\nhad come to talk of money and of love, to plot and scheme, and as they\ncame in the dark and moved most swiftly in the dark, so in the dark they\nwent away, and Baldpate's startling winter drama took reluctantly its\nfinal curtain.\n\nDown the snowy road the five followed Quimby's lead; Mr. Magee picturing\nin fancy one who had fled along this path but a short time before; the\nothers busy with many thoughts, not the least of which was of Mrs.\nQuimby's breakfast. At the door of the kitchen she met them, maternal,\nconcerned, eager to pamper and to serve, just as Mr. Magee remembered\nher on that night that now seemed so long ago. He smiled down into her\neyes, and he had an engaging smile, even at four-thirty in the morning.\n\n\"Well, Mrs. Quimby,\" he cried, \"here is the prodigal straight from that\nold husk of an inn. And believe me, he's pretty anxious to sit down to\nsome food that woman, starter of all the trouble since the world began,\nhad a hand in.\"\n\n\"Come right in, all of you,\" chirruped Mrs. Quimby, ushering them into a\npleasant odor of cookery. \"Take off your things and sit down.\nBreakfast's most ready. My land, I guess you must be pretty nigh starved\nto death. Quimby told me who was cooking for you, and I says to Quimby:\n'What,' I says, 'that no account woman-hater messing round at a woman's\njob, like that,' I says. 'Heaven pity the people at the inn,' I says.\n'Mr. Peters may be able to amuse them with stories of how Cleopatra\nwhiled away the quiet Egyptian evenings,' I says, 'and he may be able to\nthrow a little new light on Helen of Troy, who would object to having it\nthrown if she was alive and the lady I think her, but,' I says, 'when it\ncomes to cooking, I guess he stands about where you do, Quimby.' You\nsee, Quimby's repertory consists of coffee and soup, and sometimes it's\nhard to tell which he means for which.\"\n\n\"So Mr. Peters has taken you in on the secret of the book he is writing\nagainst your sex?\" remarked Billy Magee.\n\n\"Not exactly that,\" Mrs. Quimby answered, brushing back a wisp of gray\nhair, \"but he's discussed it in my presence, ignoring me at the time.\nYou see, he comes down here and reads his latest chapters to Quimby o'\nnights, and I've caught quite a lot of it on my way between the\ncook-stove and the sink.\"\n\n\"I ain't no judge of books,\" remarked Mrs. Norton from a comfortable\nrocking-chair, \"but I'll bet that one's the limit.\"\n\n\"You're right, ma'am,\" Mrs. Quimby told her. \"I ain't saying that some\nof it ain't real pretty worded, but that's just to hide the falsehood\nunderneath. My land, the lies there is in that book! You don't need to\nknow much about history to know that Jake Peters has made it over to fit\nhis argument, and that he ain't made it over so well but what the old\nseams show here and there, and the place where the braid was is plain as\ndaylight.\"\n\nAfter ten more minutes of bustle, Mrs. Quimby announced that they could\nsit down, and they were not slow to accept the invitation. The breakfast\nshe served them moved Mr. Magee to remark:\n\n\"I want to know where I stand as a judge of character. On the first\nnight I saw Mrs. Quimby, without tasting a morsel of food cooked by her,\nI said she was the best cook in the county.\"\n\nThe professor looked up from his griddle cakes.\n\n\"Why limit it to the county?\" he asked. \"I should say you were too\nparsimonious in your judgment.\"\n\nMrs. Quimby, detecting in the old man's words a compliment, flushed an\neven deeper red as she bent above the stove. Under the benign influence\nof the food and the woman's cheery personality, the spirits of the crowd\nrose. Baldpate Inn was in the past, its doors locked, its seven keys\nscattered through the dawn. Mrs. Quimby, as she continued to press food\nupon them, spoke with interest of the events that had come to pass at\nthe inn.\n\n\"It's so seldom anything really happens around here,\" she said, \"I just\nbeen hungering for news of the strange goings-on up there. And I must\nsay Quimby ain't been none too newsy on the subject. I threatened to\ncome up and join in the proceedings myself, especially when I heard\nabout the book-writing cook Providence had sent you.\"\n\n\"You would have found us on the porch with outstretched arms,\" Mr. Magee\nassured her.\n\nIt was on Kendrick that Mrs. Quimby showered her attentions, and when\nthe group rose to seek the station, amid a consultation of watches that\nrecalled the commuter who rises at dawn to play tag with a flippant\ntrain, Mr. Magee heard her say to the railroad man in a heartfelt aside:\n\n\"I don't know as I can ever thank you enough, Mr. Kendrick, for putting\nnew hope into Quimby. You'll never understand what it means, when you've\ngiven up, and your life seems all done and wasted, to hear that there's\na chance left.\"\n\n\"Won't I?\" replied Kendrick warmly. \"Mrs. Quimby, it will make me a very\nhappy man to give your husband his chance.\"\n\nThe first streaks of dawn were in the sky when the hermits of Baldpate\nfiled through the gate into the road, waving good-by to Quimby and his\nwife, who stood in their dooryard for the farewell. Down through sleepy\nlittle Asquewan Falls they paraded, meeting here and there a tired man\nwith a lunch basket in his hand, who stepped to one side and frankly\nstared while the odd procession passed.\n\nIn the station Mr. Magee encountered an old friend--he of the mop of\nginger-colored hair. The man who had complained of the slowness of the\nvillage gazed with wide eyes at Magee.\n\n\"I figured,\" he said, \"that you'd come this way again. Well, I must say\nyou've put a little life into this place. If I'd known when I saw you\nhere the other night all the exciting things you had up your sleeve, I'd\na-gone right up to Baldpate with you.\"\n\n\"But I hadn't anything up my sleeve,\" protested Magee.\n\n\"Maybe,\" replied the agent, winking. \"There's some pretty giddy stories\ngoing round about the carryings-on up at Baldpate. Shots fired, and\nstrange lights flashing--dog-gone it, the only thing that's happened\nhere in years, and I wasn't in on it. I certainly wish you'd put me wise\nto it.\"\n\n\"By the way,\" inquired Magee, \"did you notice the passengers from here\non the ten-thirty train last night?\"\n\n\"Ten-thirty,\" repeated the agent. \"Say, what sort of hours do you think\nI keep? A man has to get some sleep, even if he does work for a\nrailroad. I wasn't here at ten-thirty last night. Young Cal Hunt was on\nduty then. He's home and in bed now.\"\n\nNo help there. Into the night the girl and the two hundred thousand had\nfled together, and Mr. Magee could only wait, and wonder, as to the\nmeaning of that flight.\n\nTwo drooping figures entered the station--the mayor and his faithful\nlieutenant, Max. The dignity of the former had faded like a flower, and\nthe same withered simile might have been applied with equal force to the\naccustomed jauntiness of Lou.\n\n\"Good morning,\" said Mr. Magee in greeting. \"Taking an early train, too,\neh? Have a pleasant night?\"\n\n\"Young man,\" replied Cargan, \"if you've ever put up at a hotel in a town\nthe size of this, called the Commercial House, you know that last\nquestion has just one answer--manslaughter. I heard a minister say once\nthat all drummers are bound for hell. If they are, it'll be a pleasant\nchange for 'em.\"\n\nMr. Max delved beneath his overcoat, and brought forth the materials for\na cigarette, which he rolled between yellow fingers.\n\n\"If I was a drummer,\" he said dolefully, \"one breakfast--was that what\nthey called it, Jim?--one breakfast like we just passed through would\ndrive me into the awful habit of reading one of these here books of\n_Drummers' Yarns_.\"\n\n\"Sorry,\" smiled Magee. \"We had an excellent breakfast at Mrs. Quimby's.\nReally, you should have stayed. By the way, where is Bland?\"\n\n\"Got shaky in the knees,\" said Cargan. \"Afraid of the reformers. Ain't\nhad much experience in these things, or he'd know he might just as well\ntremble at the approach of a blue-bottle fly. We put him on a train\ngoing the other direction from Reuton early this morning. He thinks he'd\nbetter seek his fortune elsewhere.\" He leaned in heavy confidence toward\nMagee. \"Say, young fellow,\" he whispered, \"put me wise. That little\nsleight of hand game you worked last night had me dizzy. Where's the\ncoin? Where's the girl? What's the game? Take the boodle and welcome--it\nain't mine--but put me next to what's doing, so I'll know how my\ninstalment of this serial story ought to read.\"\n\n\"Mr. Cargan,\" replied Magee, \"you know as much about that girl as I do.\nShe asked me to get her the money, and I did.\"\n\n\"But what's your place in the game?\"\n\n\"A looker-on in Athens,\" returned Magee. \"Translated, a guy who had\nbumped into a cyclone and was sitting tight waiting for it to blow over.\nI--I took a fancy to her, as you might put it. She wanted the money. I\ngot it for her.\"\n\n\"A pretty fairy story, my boy,\" the mayor commented.\n\n\"Absolutely true,\" smiled Magee.\n\n\"What do you think of that for an explanation, Lou,\" inquired Cargan,\n\"she asked him for the money and he gave it to her?\"\n\nMr. Max leered.\n\n\"Say, a Broadway chorus would be pleased to meet you, Magee,\" he\ncommented.\n\n\"Don't tell any of your chorus friends about me,\" replied Magee. \"I\nmight not always prove so complacent. Every man has his moments of\nfalling for romance. Even you probably fell once--and what a fall was\nthere.\"\n\n\"Can the romance stuff,\" pleaded Max. \"This chilly railway station\nwasn't meant for such giddy language.\"\n\nWasn't it? Mr. Magee looked around at the dingy walls, at the soiled\ntime-cards, at the disreputable stove. No place for romance? It was here\nhe had seen her first, in the dusk, weeping bitterly over the seemingly\nhopeless task in which he was destined to serve her. No place for\nromance--and here had begun his life's romance. The blue blithe sailor\nstill stood at attention in the \"See the World\" poster. Magee winked at\nhim. He knew about it all, he knew, he knew--he knew how alluring she\nhad looked in the blue corduroy suit, the bit of cambric pressed\nagonizingly to her face. Verily, even the sailor of the posters saw the\nworld and all its glories.\n\nThe agent leaned his face against the bars.\n\n\"Your train,\" he called, \"is crossing the Main Street trestle.\"\n\nThey filed out upon the platform, Mr. Magee carrying Mrs. Norton's\nluggage amid her effusive thanks. On the platform waited a stranger\nequipped for travel. It was Mr. Max who made the great discovery.\n\n\"By the Lord Harry,\" he cried, \"it's the Hermit of Baldpate Mountain.\"\n\nAnd so it was, his beard gone, his hair clumsily hacked, his body garbed\nin the height of an old and ludicrous fashion, his face set bravely\ntoward the cities once more.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said, \"I walked the floor, thinking it all over. I knew it\nwould happen, and it has. The winters are hard, and the sight of you--it\nwas too much. The excitement, the talk--it did for me, did for my oath.\nSo I'm going back to her--back to Brooklyn for Christmas.\"\n\n\"A merry one to you,\" growled Cargan.\n\n\"Maybe,\" replied Mr. Peters. \"Very likely, if she's feeling that way. I\nhope so. I ain't giving up the hermit job altogether--I'll come back in\nthe summers, to my post-card business. There's money in it, if it's\nhandled right. But I've spent my last winter on that lonesome hill.\"\n\n\"As author to author,\" asked Magee, \"how about your book?\"\n\n\"There won't be any mention of that,\" the hermit predicted, \"in\nBrooklyn. I've packed it away. Maybe I can work on it summers, if she\ndoesn't come up here with me and insist on running my hermit business\nfor me. I hope she won't, it would sort of put a crimp in it--but if she\nwants to I won't refuse. And maybe that book'll never get done.\nSometimes as I've sat in my shack at night and read, it's come to me\nthat all the greatest works since the world began have been those that\nnever got finished.\"\n\nThe Reuton train roared up to them through the gray morning, and paused\nimpatiently at Upper Asquewan Falls. Aboard it clambered the hermits,\namateur and professional. Mr. Magee, from the platform, waved good-by to\nthe agent standing forlorn in the station door. He watched the building\nuntil it was only a blur in the dawn. A kindly feeling for it was in his\nheart. After all, it had been in the waiting-room--\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX\n\nTHE ADMIRAL'S GAME\n\n\nThe village of Upper Asquewan Falls gave a correct imitation of snow\nupon the desert's dusty face, and was no more. Bidding a reluctant\ngood-by to up-state romance, Mr. Magee entered the solitary day coach\nwhich, with a smoker, made up the local to Reuton. He spent a few\nmoments adjusting Mrs. Norton to her new environment, and listened to\nher voluble expressions of joy in the fact that her boarding-house\nloomed ahead. Then he started for the smoker. On his way he paused at\nthe seat occupied by the ex-hermit of Baldpate, and fixed his eyes on\nthe pale blue necktie Mr. Peters had resurrected for his return to the\nworld of men.\n\n\"Pretty, ain't it?\" remarked the hermit, seeing whither Mr. Magee's gaze\ndrifted. \"She picked it. I didn't exactly like it when she first gave it\nto me, but I see my mistake now. I'm wearing it home as a sort of a\nwhite flag of truce. Or almost white. Do you know, Mr. Magee, I'm\nsomewhat nervous about what I'll say when I come into her presence\nagain--about my inaugural address, you might put it. What would be your\nconversation on such an occasion? If you'd been away from a wife for\nfive years, what would you say when you drifted back?\"\n\n\"That would depend,\" replied Magee, \"on the amount of time she allowed\nme for my speech.\"\n\n\"You've hit the nail on the head,\" replied Mr. Peters admiringly. \"She's\nquick. She's like lightning. She won't give me any time if she can help\nit. That's why I'd like to have a wonderful speech all ready--something\nthat would hold her spellbound and tongue-tied until I finished. It\nwould take a literary classic to do that.\"\n\n\"What you want,\" laughed Magee, \"is a speech with the punch.\"\n\n\"Exactly,\" agreed Mr. Peters. \"I guess I won't go over to Brooklyn the\nminute I hit New York. I guess I'll study the lights along the big\nstreet, and brush elbows with the world a bit, before I reveal myself to\nher. Maybe if I took in a few shows--but don't think I won't go to her.\nMy mind is made up. And I guess she'll be glad to see me, too. In her\nway. I got to fix it with her, though, to come back to my post-card\ntrade in the summers. I wonder what she'll say to that. Maybe she could\nstay at the inn under an assumed name while I was hermiting up at the\nshack.\"\n\nHe laughed softly.\n\n\"It'd be funny, wouldn't it,\" he said. \"Her sitting on the veranda\nwatching me sell post-cards to the ladies, and listening to the various\nstories of how a lost love has blighted my life, and so forth. Yes, it'd\nbe real funny--only Ellen never had much sense of humor. That was always\nher great trouble. If you ever marry, Mr. Magee, and I suppose you will,\ntake my advice. Marry a sense of humor first, and a woman\nincidental-like.\"\n\nMr. Magee promised to bear this counsel in mind, and went forward into\nthe smoking-car. Long rows of red plush seats, unoccupied save for the\nmayor and Max, greeted his eye. He strolled to where they sat, about\nhalf-way down the car, and lighted an after-breakfast cigar.\n\nMax slouched in the unresponsive company of a cigarette on one side of\nthe car; across the aisle the mayor of Reuton leaned heavily above a\ncard-table placed between two seats. He was playing solitaire. Mr. Magee\nwondered whether this was merely a display of bravado against scheming\nreformers, or whether Mr. Cargan found in it real diversion. Curious, he\nslid into the place across the table from the mayor.\n\n\"Napoleon,\" he remarked lightly, \"whiled away many a dull hour with\ncards, I believe.\"\n\nClumsily the mayor shuffled the cards. He flung them down one by one on\nthe polished surface of the table rudely, as though they were reform\nvotes he was counting. His thick lips were tightly closed, his big hands\nhovered with unaccustomed uncertainty over the pasteboards.\n\n\"Quit your kidding,\" he replied. \"I don't believe cards was invented in\nNap's day. Was they? It's a shame a fellow can't have a little\nadmiration for a great leader like Nap without all you funny boys\njollying him about it. That boy sure knew how to handle the voters. I've\nread a lot about him, and I like his style.\"\n\n\"You let history alone,\" snarled Mr. Max, across the aisle, \"or it'll\nrepeat itself and another guy I know'll go to the island.\"\n\n\"If you mean me,\" returned Cargan, \"forget it. There ain't no St. Helena\nin my future.\" He winked at Magee. \"Lou's a little peevish this\nmorning,\" he said. \"Had a bad night.\"\n\nHe busied himself with the cards. Mr. Magee looked on, only half\ninterested. Then, suddenly, his interest grew. He watched the mayor\nbuild, in two piles; he saw that the deck from which he built was thick.\nA weird suspicion shot across his mind.\n\n\"Tell me,\" he asked, \"is this the admiral's game of solitaire?\"\n\n\"Exactly what I was going to ask,\" said a voice. Magee looked up.\nKendrick had come in, and stood now above the table. His tired eyes were\nupon it, fascinated; his lips twitched strangely.\n\n\"Yes,\" answered the mayor, \"this is the admiral's game. You'd hardly\nexpect me to know it, would you? I don't hang out at the swell clubs\nwhere the admiral does. They won't have me there. But once I took the\nadmiral on a public service board with me--one time when I wanted a lot\nof dignity and no brains pretty bad--and he sort of come back by\nteaching me his game in the long dull hours when we had nothing to do\nbut serve the public. The thing gets a hold on you, somehow. Let's\nsee--now the spade--now the heart.\"\n\nKendrick leaned closer. His breath came with a noisy quickness that\nbrought the fact of his breathing insistently to Magee's mind.\n\n\"I never knew--how it was played,\" he said.\n\nSomething told Mr. Magee that he ought to rise and drag Kendrick away\nfrom that table. Why? He did not know. Still, it ought to be done. But\nthe look in Kendrick's eyes showed clearly that the proverbial wild\nhorses could not do it then.\n\n\"Tell me how it's played,\" went on Kendrick, trying to be calm.\n\n\"You must be getting old,\" replied the mayor. \"The admiral told me the\nyoung men at his club never took any interest in his game. 'Solitaire,'\nhe says to me, 'is an old man's trade.' It's a great game, Mr.\nKendrick.\"\n\n\"A great game,\" repeated Kendrick, \"yes, it's a great game.\" His tone\nwas dull. \"I want to know how it's played,\" he said again.\n\n\"The six of clubs,\" reflected the mayor, throwing down another card.\n\"Say, she's going fine now. There ain't much to it. You use two decks,\nexactly alike--shuffle 'em together--the eight of hearts--the jack\nof--say, that's great--you lay the cards down here, just as they\ncome--like this--\"\n\nHe paused. His huge hand held a giddy pasteboard. A troubled look was on\nhis face. Then he smiled happily, and went on in triumph.\n\n\"And then you build, Mr. Kendrick,\" he said. \"The reds and the blacks.\nYou build the blacks on the left, and the reds on the right--do you get\nme? Then--say, what's the matter?\"\n\nFor Kendrick had swayed and almost fallen on the admiral's game--the\ngame that had once sent a man to hell.\n\n\"Go on,\" he said, bracing. \"Nothing's the matter. Go on. Build, damn it,\nbuild!\"\n\nThe mayor looked at him a moment in surprise, then continued.\n\n\"Now the king,\" he muttered, \"now the ace. We're on the home stretch,\ngoing strong. There, it's finished. It's come out right. A great game, I\ntell you.\"\n\nHe leaned back. Kendrick's fever-yellowed face was like a bronze mask.\nHis eyes were fiercely on the table and the two decks of cards that lay\nthere.\n\n\"And when you've finished,\" he pointed. \"When you've finished--\"\n\nMr. Cargan picked up the deck on the left.\n\n\"All black,\" he said, \"when the game comes out right.\"\n\n\"And the other?\" Kendrick persisted softly. He pointed to the remaining\ndeck. A terrible smile of understanding drew his thin lips taut. \"And\nthe other, Mr. Cargan?\"\n\n\"Red,\" replied Cargan. \"What else could it be? All red.\"\n\nHe picked it up and shuffled through it to prove his point. Kendrick\nturned like a drunken man and staggered back down the aisle. Magee rose\nand hurried after him. At the door he turned, and the look on his face\ncaused Magee to shudder.\n\n\"You heard?\" he said helplessly. \"My God! It's funny, isn't it?\" He\nlaughed hysterically, and drawing out his handkerchief, passed it across\nhis forehead. \"A pleasant thing to think about--a pleasant thing to\nremember.\"\n\nProfessor Bolton pushed open the smoker door.\n\n\"I thought I'd join you,\" he began. \"Why, David, what is it? What's the\nmatter?\"\n\n\"Nothing,\" replied Kendrick wildly. \"There's nothing the matter. Let\nme--by--please.\" He crossed the swaying platform and disappeared into\nthe other car.\n\nFor a moment the professor and Magee gazed after him, and then without a\nword moved down the car to join Cargan and Max. Magee's mind was dazed\nby the tragedy he had witnessed. \"A pleasant thing to think about--\" He\ndid not envy Kendrick his thoughts.\n\nThe mayor of Reuton had pushed aside the cards and lighted a huge cigar.\n\n\"Well, Doc,\" he remarked jocosely, \"how's trade? Sold any new schemes\nfor renovating the world to the up-state rubes? I should think this\nwould be sort of an off-season for the reform business. Peace on earth,\ngood will toward men--that ain't exactly a good advertisement for the\nreformers, is it?\"\n\n\"It's an excellent one,\" replied Professor Bolton. \"The first essential\nof good will toward men is not to rob and debauch them.\"\n\n\"Oh, well, Doc, don't let's argue the matter,\" replied Cargan easily. \"I\nain't in the humor for it, anyhow. You got your beliefs, and I got my\nbeliefs. And that ain't no reason why we should not smoke a couple of\ngood cigars together. Have one?\"\n\n\"Thanks. I--\" reluctantly the old man took a gay-banded Havana from the\nmayor's huge fist. \"You're very kind.\"\n\n\"I suppose it's sort of a blow to you,\" the mayor went on, \"that your\nplans up there on the mountain went all to smash. It ought to teach you\na lesson, Doc. There ain't nothing to the reform gag.\"\n\nThe train slowed down at a small yellow station. Mr. Magee peered out\nthe window. \"Hooperstown,\" he read, \"Reuton--10 miles.\" He saw Mr. Max\nget up and leave the car.\n\n\"Not a thing to it, Doc,\" Cargan repeated, \"Your bunch has tried to get\nme before. You've shouted from the housetops that you had the goods on\nme. What's always happened?\"\n\n\"Your own creatures have acquitted you,\" replied the professor, from a\ncloud of Cargan cigar smoke.\n\n\"Fair-minded men decided that I hadn't done wrong. I tell you, Doc,\nthere's dishonest graft, and I'm against that always. And there's honest\ngraft--the rightful perquisites of a high office. That's the trouble\nwith you church politicians. You can't see the difference between the\ntwo.\"\n\n\"I'm not a church politician,\" protested the professor. \"I'm bitterly\nopposed to the lily-white crowd who continually rant against the thing\nthey don't understand. I'm practical, as practical as you, and when--\"\n\nNoiselessly Mr. Max slid up to the group, and stood silent, his eyes\nwide, his yellow face pitiful, the fear of a dog about to be whipped in\nhis every feature.\n\n\"Jim,\" he cried, \"Jim! You got to get me out of this. You got to stand\nby me.\"\n\n\"Why, what's the matter, Lou?\" asked the mayor in surprise.\n\n\"Matter enough,\" whined Max. \"Do you know what's happened? Well, I'll\ntell--\"\n\nMr. Max was thrust aside, and replaced by a train newsboy. Mr. Magee\nfelt that he should always remember that boy, his straw colored hair,\nhis freckled beaming face, his lips with their fresh perpetual smile.\n\n\"All the morning papers, gents,\" proclaimed the boy. \"Get the _Reuton\nStar_. All about the bribery.\"\n\nHe held up the paper. It's huge black head-lines looked dull and old and\nsoggy. But the story they told was new and live and startling.\n\n\"The Mayor Trapped,\" shrilled the head-lines. \"Attempt to Pass Big Bribe\nat Baldpate Inn Foiled by Star Reporter. Hayden of the Suburban Commits\nSuicide to Avoid Disgrace.\"\n\n\"Give me a paper, boy,\" said the mayor. \"Yes--a _Star_.\" His voice was\neven, his face unmoved. He took the sheet and studied it, with an easy\nsmile. Clinging in fear to his side, Max read, too. At length Mr. Cargan\nspoke, looking up at Magee.\n\n\"So,\" he remarked. \"So--reporters, eh? You and your lady friend?\nReporters for this lying sheet--the _Star_?\"\n\nMr. Magee smiled up from his own copy of the paper.\n\n\"Not I,\" he answered. \"But my lady friend--yes. It seems she was just\nthat. A _Star_ reporter you can call her, and tell no lie, Mr. Mayor.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI\n\nTHE MAYOR IS WELCOMED HOME\n\n\nIt was a good story--the story which the mayor, Max, the professor and\nMagee read with varying emotions there in the smoking-car. The girl had\nserved her employers well, and Mr. Magee, as he read, felt a thrill of\npride in her. Evidently the employers had felt that same thrill. For in\nthe captions under the pictures, in the head-lines, and in a first-page\neditorial, none of which the girl had written, the _Star_ spoke\nadmiringly of its woman reporter who had done a man's work--who had gone\nto Baldpate Inn and had brought back a gigantic bribe fund \"alone and\nunaided\".\n\n\"Indeed?\" smiled Mr. Magee to himself.\n\nIn the editorial on that first page the triumphant cry of the _Star_\narose to shatter its fellows in the heavens. At last, said the editor,\nthe long campaign which his paper alone of all the Reuton papers had\nwaged against a corrupt city administration was brought to a successful\nclose. The victory was won. How had this been accomplished? Into the\n_Star_ office had come rumors, a few days back, of the proposed payment\nof a big bribe at the inn on Baldpate Mountain. The paper had decided\nthat one of its representatives must be on the ground. It had debated\nlong whom to send. Miss Evelyn Rhodes, its well-known special writer,\nhad got the tip in question; she had pleaded to go to the inn. The\neditor, considering her sex, had sternly refused. Then gradually he had\nbeen brought to see the wisdom of sending a girl rather than a man. The\nsex of the former would put the guilty parties under surveillance off\nguard. So Miss Rhodes was despatched to the inn. Here was her story. It\nconvicted Cargan beyond a doubt. The very money offered as a bribe was\nnow in the hands of the _Star_ editor, and would be turned over to\nProsecutor Drayton at his request. All this under the disquieting title\n\"Prison Stripes for the Mayor\".\n\nThe girl's story told how, with one companion, she had gone to Upper\nAsquewan Falls. There was no mention of the station waiting-room, nor of\nthe tears shed therein on a certain evening, Mr. Magee noted. She had\nreached the inn on the morning of the day when the combination was to be\nphoned. Bland was already there, shortly after came the mayor and Max.\n\n\"You got to get me out of this,\" Magee heard Max pleading over Cargan's\nshoulder.\n\n\"Keep still!\" replied the mayor roughly. He was reading his copy of the\n_Star_ with keen interest now.\n\n\"I've done your dirty work for years,\" whined Max. \"Who puts on the\nrubber shoes and sneaks up dark alleys hunting votes among the garbage,\nwhile you do the Old Glory stunt on Main Street? I do. You got to get me\nout of this. It may mean jail. I couldn't stand that. I'd die.\"\n\nA horrible parody of a man's real fear was in his face. The mayor shook\nhimself as though he would be rid forever of the coward hanging on his\narm.\n\n\"Hush up, can't you?\" he said. \"I'll see you through.\"\n\n\"You got to,\" Lou Max wailed.\n\nMiss Rhodes' story went on to tell how Hayden refused to phone the\ncombination; how the mayor and Max dynamited the safe and secured the\nprecious package, only to lose it in another moment to a still different\ncontingent at the inn; how Hayden had come, of his suicide when he found\nthat his actions were in danger of exposure--\"a bitter smile for\nKendrick in that\" reflected Magee--and how finally, through a strange\nseries of accidents, the money came into the hands of the writer for the\n_Star_. These accidents were not given in detail.\n\n\"An amusing feature of the whole affair,\" said Miss Evelyn Rhodes, \"was\nthe presence at the inn of Mr. William Hallowell Magee, the New York\nwriter of light fiction, who had come there to escape the distractions\nof a great city, and to work in the solitude, and who immediately on his\narrival became involved in the surprising drama of Baldpate.\"\n\n\"I'm an amusing feature,\" reflected Magee.\n\n\"Mr. Magee,\" continued Miss Rhodes, \"will doubtless be one of the\nstate's chief witnesses when the case against Cargan comes to trial, as\nwill also Professor Thaddeus Bolton, holder of the Crandall Chair of\nComparative Literature at Reuton University, and Mr. David Kendrick,\nformerly of the Suburban, but who retired six years ago to take up his\nresidence abroad. The latter two went to the inn to represent Prosecutor\nDrayton, and made every effort in their power to secure the package of\nmoney from the reporter for the _Star_, not knowing her connection with\nthe affair.\"\n\n\"Well, Mr. Magee?\" asked Professor Bolton, laying down the paper which\nhe had been perusing at a distance of about an inch from his nose.\n\n\"Once again, Professor,\" laughed Magee, \"reporters have entered your\nlife.\"\n\nThe old man sighed.\n\n\"It was very kind of her,\" he said, \"not to mention that I was the\nperson who compared blondes of the peroxide variety with suffragettes.\nOthers will not be so kind. The matter will be resurrected and used\nagainst me at the trial, I'm sure. A plucky girl, Mr. Magee--a very\nplucky girl. How times do change. When I was young, girls of her age\nwould scarcely have thought of venturing forth into the highways on such\nperilous missions. I congratulate you. You showed unusual perception.\nYou deserve a great reward--the young lady's favor, let us say.\"\n\n\"You got to get me out of this,\" Max was still telling the mayor.\n\n\"For God's sake,\" cried Cargan, \"shut up and let me think.\" He sat for a\nmoment staring at one place, his face still lacking all emotion, but his\neyes a trifle narrower than before. \"You haven't got me yet,\" he cried,\nstanding up. \"By the eternal, I'll fight to the last ditch, and I'll\nwin. I'll show Drayton he can't play this game on me. I'll show the\n_Star_. That dirty sheet has hounded me for years. I'll put it out of\nbusiness. And I'll send the reformers howling into the alleys, sick of\nthe fuss they started themselves.\"\n\n\"Perhaps,\" said Professor Bolton. \"But only after the fight of your\nlife, Cargan.\"\n\n\"I'm ready for it,\" cried Cargan. \"I ain't down and out yet. But to\nthink--a woman--a little bit of a girl I could have put in my\npocket--it's all a big joke. I'll beat them--I'll show them--the game's\nfar from played out--I'll win--and--if--I--don't--\"\n\nHe crumbled suddenly into his seat, his eyes on that unpleasant line\nabout \"Prison Stripes for the Mayor\". For an instant it seemed as though\nhis fight was irrevocably lost, and he knew it. Lines of age appeared to\ncreep from out the fat folds of his face, and stand mockingly there. He\nlooked a beaten man.\n\n\"If I don't,\" he stammered pitifully, \"well, they sent him to an island\nat the end. The reformers got Napoleon at the last. I won't be alone in\nthat.\"\n\nAt this unexpected sight of weakness in his hero, Mr. Max set up a\nrenewed babble of fear at his side. The train was in the Reuton suburbs\nnow. At a neat little station it slowed down to a stop, and a florid\npoliceman entered the smoking-car. Cargan looked up.\n\n\"Hello, Dan,\" he said. His voice was lifeless; the old-time ring was\ngone.\n\nThe policeman removed his helmet and shifted it nervously.\n\n\"I thought I'd tell you, Mr. Cargan,\" he said \"I thought I'd warn you.\nYou'd better get off here. There's a big crowd in the station at Reuton.\nThey're waiting for you, sir; they've heard you're on this train. This\nlying newspaper, Mr. Cargan, it's been telling tales--I guess you know\nabout that. There's a big mob. You better get off here, sir, and go\ndown-town on a car.\"\n\nIf the mighty Cargan had looked limp and beaten for a moment he looked\nthat way no more. He stood up, and his head seemed almost to touch the\nroof of the car. Over that big patrolman he towered; his eyes were cold\nand hard again; his lips curved in the smile of the master.\n\n\"And why,\" he bellowed, \"should I get off here? Tell me that, Dan.\"\n\n\"Well, sir,\" replied the embarrassed copper, \"they're ugly. There's no\ntelling what they might do. It's a bad mob--this newspaper has stirred\n'em up.\"\n\n\"Ugly, are they?\" sneered Cargan. \"Ever seen the bunch I would go out of\nmy way for, Dan?\"\n\n\"I meant it all right, sir,\" said Dan. \"As a friend to a man who's been\na friend to me. No, I never saw you afraid of any bunch yet, but this--\"\n\n\"This,\" replied Cargan, \"is the same old bunch. The same lily-livered\ncrowd that I've seen in the streets since I laid the first paving stone\nunder 'em myself in '91. Afraid of them? Hell! I'd walk through an ant\nhill as scared as I would through that mob. Thanks for telling me, Dan,\nbut Jim Cargan won't be in the mollycoddle class for a century or two\nyet.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said the patrolman admiringly. He hurried out of the car,\nand the mayor turned to find Lou Max pale and fearful by his side.\n\n\"What ails you now?\" he asked.\n\n\"I'm afraid,\" cried Max. \"Did you hear what he said? A mob. I saw a mob\nonce. Never again for me.\" He tried to smile, to pass it off as a\npleasant jest, but he had to wet his lips with his tongue before he\ncould go on. \"Come on, Jim. Get off here. Don't be a fool.\"\n\nThe train began to move.\n\n\"Get off yourself, you coward,\" sneered Cargan. \"Oh, I know you. It\ndoesn't take much to make your stomach shrink. Get off.\"\n\nMax eagerly seized his hat and bag.\n\n\"I will, if you don't mind,\" he said. \"See you later at Charlie's.\" And\nin a flash of tawdry attire, he was gone.\n\nThe mayor of Reuton no longer sat limp in his seat. That brief moment of\nseeming surrender was put behind forever. He walked the aisle of the\ncar, fire in his eyes, battle in his heart.\n\n\"So they're waiting for me, eh?\" he said aloud. \"Waiting for Jim Cargan.\nNow ain't it nice of them to come and meet their mayor?\"\n\nMr. Magee and the professor went into the day coach for their baggage.\nMrs. Norton motioned to the former.\n\n\"Well,\" she said, \"you know now, I suppose. And it didn't do you no harm\nto wait. I sure am glad this to-do is all over, and that child is safe.\nAnd I hope you'll remember what I said. It ain't no work for a woman, no\nhow, what with the shooting and the late hours.\"\n\n\"Your words,\" said Mr. Magee, \"are engraven on my heart.\" He proceeded\nto gather her baggage with his own, and was thus engaged when Kendrick\ncame up. The shadow of his discovery in the smoking-car an hour before\nstill haunted his sunken eyes, but his lips were half smiling with the\nnew joy of living that had come to him.\n\n\"Mr. Magee,\" he began, \"I hardly need mention that the terrible thing\nwhich happened--in there--is between you and me--and the man who's dead.\nNo one must know. Least of all, the girl who is to become my wife--it\nwould embitter her whole life--as it has mine.\"\n\n\"Don't say that,\" Magee pleaded. \"You will forget in time, I'm sure. And\nyou may trust me--I had forgotten already.\" And indeed he had, on the\ninstant when his eyes fell upon the _Reuton Star_.\n\nMiss Thornhill approached, her dark smiling eyes on Magee. Kendrick\nlooked at her proudly, and spoke suddenly, determinedly:\n\n\"You're right, I will forget. She shall help me.\"\n\n\"Mr. Magee,\" said the girl, \"I'm so pleased at the splendid end to your\nimpulsive philanthropy. I just knew the adventure couldn't have anything\nbut a happy ending--it was so full of youth and faith and--and charity\nor its synonym. This mustn't be good-by. You must come and see me--come\nand see us--all.\"\n\n\"I shall be happy to,\" answered Magee sincerely. \"It will always be a\nmatter of regret to me that I was not able to serve you--also--on\nBaldpate Mountain. But out of it you come with something more precious\nthan fine gold, and that shall be my consolation.\"\n\n\"Let it be,\" smiled Myra Thornhill, \"as it is surely mine. Good-by.\"\n\n\"And good luck,\" whispered Magee, as he took Kendrick's hand.\n\nOver his shoulder, as he passed to the platform, he saw them look into\neach other's eyes, and he felt that the memory of the admiral's game\nwould in time cease to haunt David Kendrick.\n\nA shadow had fallen upon the train--the shadow of the huge Reuton\nstation. In the half-light on the platform Mr. Magee encountered the\nmayor of Reuton. Above the lessening roar of the train there sounded\nahead of them the voices of men in turmoil and riot. Mr. Cargan turned\nupon Magee a face as placid and dispassionate as that of one who enters\nan apple orchard in May.\n\n\"The boys,\" he smiled grimly, \"welcoming me home.\"\n\nThen the train came to a stop, and Mr. Magee looked down into a great\narray of faces, and heard for the first time the low unceasing rumble of\nan angry mob. Afterward he marveled at that constant guttural roar, how\nit went on and on, humming like a tune, never stopping, disconnected\nquite from the occasional shrill or heavy voices that rang out in\ndistinguishable words. The mayor looked coolly down into those upturned\nfaces, he listened a moment to the rumble of a thousand throats, then he\ntook off his derby with satiric politeness.\n\n\"Glad to see one and all!\" he cried.\n\nAnd now above the mutterings angry words could be heard, \"That's him,\"\n\"That's two-hundred-thousand-dollar Cargan,\" \"How's the weather on\nBaldpate?\" and other sarcastic flings. Then a fashion of derisive\ncat-calls came and went. After which, here and there, voices spoke of\nropes, of tar and feathers. And still the mayor smiled as one for whom\nthe orchard gate swung open in May.\n\nA squad of policemen, who had entered the car from the rear, forced\ntheir way out on to the platform.\n\n\"Want us to see you through the crowd, Mr. Cargan?\" the lieutenant\nasked.\n\nNew hoots and cries ascended to the station rafters. \"Who pays the\npolice?\" \"We do.\" \"Who owns 'em?\" \"Cargan.\" Thus question and answer\nwere bandied back and forth. Again a voice demanded in strident tones\nthe ignominious tar and feathers.\n\nJim Cargan had not risen from the slums to be master of his town without\na keen sense of the theatric. He ordered the police back into the car.\n\"And stay there,\" he demanded. The lieutenant demurred. One look from\nthe mayor sent him scurrying. Mr. Cargan took from his pocket a big\ncigar, and calmly lighted it.\n\n\"Some of them guys out there,\" he remarked to Magee, \"belong to the\nSunday-school crowd. Pretty actions for them--pillars of the church\nhowling like beasts.\"\n\nAnd still, like that of beasts, the mutter of the mob went on, now in an\nundertone, now louder, and still that voice that first had plead for tar\nand feathers plead still--for feathers and tar. And here a group\npreferred the rope.\n\nAnd toward them, with the bland smile of a child on his great face, his\ncigar tilted at one angle, his derby at another, the mayor of Reuton\nwalked unflinchingly.\n\nThe roar became mad, defiant. But Cargan stepped forward boldly. Now he\nreached the leaders of the mob. He pushed his way in among them, smiling\nbut determined. They closed in on him. A little man got firmly in his\npath. He took the little man by the shoulders and stood him aside with\nsome friendly word. And now he was past ten rows or more of them on his\nway through, and the crowd began to scurry away. They scampered like\nants, clawing at one another's backs to make a path.\n\nAnd so finally, between two rows of them, the mayor of Reuton went his\nway triumphantly. Somewhere, on the edge of the crowd, an admiring voice\nspoke. \"Hello, Jim!\" The mayor waved his hand. The rumble of their\nvoices ceased at last. Jim Cargan was still master of the city.\n\n\"Say what you will,\" remarked Mr. Magee to the professor as they stood\ntogether on the platform of the car, \"there goes a man.\"\n\nHe did not wait to hear the professor's answer. For he saw the girl of\nthe Upper Asquewan station, standing on a baggage truck far to the left\nof the mob, wave to him over their heads. Eagerly he fought his way to\nher side. It was a hard fight, the crowd would not part for him as it\nhad parted for the man who owned the city.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII\n\nTHE USUAL THING\n\n\n\"Hello, Mr. Hold-up Man!\" The girl seized Mr. Magee's proffered hand and\nleaped down from the truck to his side.\n\n\"Bless the gods of the mountain,\" said Magee; \"they have given me back\nmy accomplice, safe and sound.\"\n\n\"They were black lonesome gods,\" she replied, \"and they kept whispering\nfearful things in my ear I couldn't understand. I'm glad they didn't\nkeep me.\"\n\n\"So am I.\" The crowd surged about them; many in it smiled and spoke\nadmiringly to the girl. \"It's great to be acquainted with the heroine of\nthe hour,\" Mr. Magee continued. \"I congratulate you. You have overthrown\nan empire of graft, it seems.\"\n\n\"Alone and unaided,\" she quoted, smiling mockingly up into his face.\n\n\"Absolutely alone and entirely unaided,\" said Billy Magee. \"I'll swear\nto that in court.\"\n\nMrs. Norton panted up to them.\n\n\"Hello, dearie!\" she cried. \"Thank heaven you're safe. Have you been up\nto the house? How's Sadie getting along? I just know everything is\ntopsyturvy.\"\n\n\"Not at all,\" replied Miss Rhodes. \"Breakfast passed off like clockwork\nat seven, and even Mr. Golden had no complaints to offer. Dear, I must\nthank you for all you've done for me. It was splendid--\"\n\n\"Not now,\" objected Mrs. Norton. \"I got to get up to the house now. What\nwith Christmas only two days away, and a lot of shopping to be done, I\ncan't linger in this drafty station for thanks. I want you to bring Mr.\nMagee right up to the house for lunch. I'll have a meal ready that'll\nshow him what suffering must have been going on inside me while I sat\nstill watching that hermit man burlesquing the cook business.\"\n\n\"Delighted,\" said Magee. \"I'll find you a cab.\" He led the way to a row\nof such vehicles, Mrs. Norton and the girl following.\n\n\"Seems like you're always putting me in a cab,\" remarked the older woman\nas she climbed inside. \"I don't know what Mary and me would have done if\nit hadn't been for you. You're a mighty handy person to have around, Mr.\nMagee. Ain't he, dearie?\" She winked openly at Magee.\n\n\"And a delightful one,\" agreed the girl, in a matter-of-fact tone.\n\nMrs. Norton was driven away up the snowy street. As Mr. Magee and the\ngirl turned, they beheld the Hermit of Baldpate staring with undisguised\nexultation at the tall buildings of Reuton.\n\n\"Why, it's Mr. Peters!\" the girl cried.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Magee. \"His prediction has come true. We and our\nexcitement proved too much for him. He's going back to Brooklyn and to\nher.\"\n\n\"I'm so glad,\" she cried. She stretched out her hand to the hermit. He\ntook it, somewhat embarrassed.\n\n\"Glad to see you,\" he said. \"You certainly appear to have stirred things\nup, miss. But women are good at that. I've always said--\"\n\n\"Mr. Magee tells me you're going back, after all?\" she broke in.\n\n\"Yes,\" returned Peters. \"I knew it. I told you so. It was all right in\nthe summer, when the bands played, and the warm wind was hermiting on\nthe mountain, too. But in the fall, it's always been hard, and I've\nheard the white lights calling, calling--why, I've even heard her--heard\nEllen. This fall you came, and there was something doing on\nBaldpate--and I knew that when you went, I'd just naturally have to go,\ntoo. So--I'm going.\"\n\n\"Splendid,\" commented the girl.\n\n\"It'll be somewhat delicate,\" continued the hermit, \"bursting in on\nEllen after all these years. As I told Mr. Magee, I wish I had an\ninaugural address, or something like that.\"\n\n\"I have it,\" responded Evelyn Rhodes. \"I'll write a story about you for\nto-morrow morning's paper. All about how the Christmas spirit has\novercome the Hermit of Baldpate, and how he's going back to his wife,\nwith his heart filled with love for her--it is filled, isn't it?\"\n\n\"Well, yes,\" agreed Mr. Peters. \"I reckon you might call it that.\"\n\n\"And then you can send her a copy of the paper, and follow it up in\nperson.\"\n\n\"A good idea,\" commented Billy Magee.\n\n\"At first glance, yes,\" studied Peters. \"But, on the other hand, it\nwould be the death knell of my post-card business, and I'm calculating\nto go back to Baldpate next summer and take it up again. No, I'm afraid\nI can't let it be generally known that I've quit living in a shack on\nthe mountain for love of somebody or other.\"\n\n\"Once more,\" smiled Magee, \"big business muzzles the press.\"\n\n\"Not that I ain't obliged to you for the offer,\" added the hermit.\n\n\"Of course,\" said the girl, \"I understand. And I wish you the best of\nluck--along with a merry Christmas.\"\n\n\"The same to you,\" replied the hermit heartily.\n\n\"Miss--er--Miss Rhodes and I will see you again,\" predicted Mr. Magee,\n\"next summer at Baldpate Inn.\"\n\nThe hermit looked at the girl, who turned her face away.\n\n\"I hope it'll turn out that way, I'm sure,\" he said. \"I'll let you have\na reduction on all post-cards, just for old times' sake. Now I must find\nout about the New York trains.\"\n\nHe melted into the crowd, an odd figure still, his garb in a fashion\nlong forgotten, his clumsily hacked hair brushing the collar of his\nancient coat. Magee and the girl found the check room, and after he had\nbeen relieved of the burden of his baggage, set out up the main street\nof Reuton. It was a typical up-state town, deep in the throes of the\nholiday season. The windows of the stores were green with holly; the\nfaces of the passers-by reflected the excitements of Christmas and of\nthe upheaval in civic politics which were upon them almost together.\n\n\"Tell me,\" said the girl, \"are you glad--at the way it has turned out?\nAre you glad I was no lady Captain Kidd?\"\n\n\"It has all turned out--or is about to turn out--beautifully,\" Mr. Magee\nanswered. \"You may remember that on the veranda of Baldpate Inn I spoke\nof one summer hotel flirtation that was going to prove more than that.\nLet me--\"\n\nHer laugh interrupted.\n\n\"You don't even know my name.\"\n\n\"What's the matter with Evelyn Rhodes?\" suggested Magee.\n\n\"Nothing. It's a perfectly good name. But it isn't mine. I just write\nunder it.\"\n\n\"I prefer Mary, anyhow,\" smiled Billy Magee. \"She called you that. It's\nMary.\"\n\n\"Mary what?\"\n\n\"You have no idea,\" said he, \"how immaterial that is.\"\n\nThey came upon a throng blocking the sidewalk in front of a tall\nbuilding of stone. The eyes of the throng were on bulletins; it muttered\nmuch as they had muttered who gathered in the station.\n\n\"The office of the _Star_,\" explained the girl. \"The crowd is looking\nfor new excitement. Do you know, for two whole hours this morning we had\non exhibition in the window a certain package--a package of money!\"\n\n\"I think,\" smiled Magee, \"I've seen it somewhere.\"\n\n\"I think you have. Drayton came and took it from us as soon as he heard.\nBut it was the very best proof we could have offered the people. They\nlike to see for themselves. It's a passion with them. We've done for\nCargan forever.\"\n\n\"Cargan says he will fight.\"\n\n\"Of course he will,\" she replied. \"But this will prove Napoleon's\nWaterloo. Whether or not he is sent to prison--and perhaps he can escape\nthat, he's very clever--his power in Reuton is broken. He can't possibly\nwin at the next election--it comes very soon. I'm so glad. For years our\neditor has been fighting corruption, in the face of terrible odds and\ntemptations. I'm so glad it's over now--and the _Star_ has won.\"\n\n\"Through you,\" said Magee softly.\n\n\"With--some one--to help,\" she smiled. \"I must go up-stairs now and find\nout what new task is set for me.\"\n\nMr. Magee postponed the protest on the tip of his tongue, and, climbing\nthe gloomy stairs that newspapers always affect, they came into the city\nroom of the _Star_. Though the paper had been long on the street, the\nexcitement of the greatest coup of years still lingered in the place.\nMagee saw the deferential smiles that greeted the girl, and watched her\nas she made her way to the city editor's desk. In a moment she was back\nat his side.\n\n\"I've got my assignment,\" she smiled ruefully. They descended to the\nstreet. \"It's wonderful,\" she went on, \"how curt a city editor can be\nwith any one who pulls off a good story. The job I've got now reminds me\nof the experience of an old New York reporter who used to work on the\n_Star_.\"\n\nWith difficulty they threaded their way through the crowd, and moved\nalong beside the green-decked windows.\n\n\"He was the first man sent out by his paper on Park Row on the Spanish\nWar assignment,\" she went on, \"and he behaved rather brilliantly, I\nbelieve. Well, he came back after the fight was over, all puffed up and\nimportant, and they told him the city editor wanted him. 'They're going\nto send me to the Philippines,' he told me he thought as he went into\nthe presence. When the city editor ordered him to rush down to a\ntwo-alarm fire in Houston Street he nearly collapsed. I know how he\nfelt. I feel that way now.\"\n\n\"What was it--a one-alarm fire?\" asked Magee.\n\n\"No,\" she replied, \"a sweet little story about the Christmas toys. I've\ndone it to death every Christmas for--three years. Oh, well, I can do it\nagain. But it'll have to wait until after Mrs. Norton's lunch.\"\n\nShe led him into a street where every house was like its neighbor, even\nto the \"Rooms\" sign in the windows, and up the steps of one she could\nhave recognized only by counting from the corner. They entered the murky\nand stereotyped atmosphere of a boarding-house hallway, with its\ninevitable hat-rack and the uncollected letters of the homeless on a\ntable. Mrs. Norton came breezily forth to meet them.\n\n\"Well, Mr. Magee,\" she said, \"I certainly am glad you've came. I'm busy\non that lunch now. Dearie, show him into the parlor to wait.\"\n\nMr. Magee was shown in. That rooming-house parlor seemed to moan\ndismally as it received him. He strolled about and gazed at the objects\nof art which had at various times accrued to Mrs. Norton's personality:\na steel engraving called _Too Late_, which depicted an angry father\narriving at a church door to find his eloping daughter in the arms of\nstalwart youth, with the clergy looking on approvingly; another of Mr.\nJohn Drew assuming a commanding posture as Petruchio in _The Taming of\nthe Shrew_; some ennuied flabby angels riding on the clouds; a child of\nunhealthy pink clasping lovingly an inflammable dog; on the mantel a\nminiature ship, under glass, and some lady statuettes whose toilettes\nslipped down--down.\n\nAnd, on an easel, the sad portrait of a gentleman, undoubtedly the late\nlamented Norton. His uninteresting nose appeared to turn up at the\nconstant odor of cookery in which it dwelt; his hair was plastered down\nover his forehead in a gorgeous abandoned curve such as some of the\nleast sophisticated of Mr. John T. McCutcheon's gentlemen affect.\n\nMr. Magee stared round the room and smiled. Was the romance of reality\nnever to resemble the romance of his dreams? Where were the dim lights,\nwhere the distant waltz, where the magic of moonlight amid which he was\nsome day to have told a beautiful girl of his love? Hardly in Mrs.\nNorton's parlor.\n\nShe came and stood in the doorway. Hatless, coatless, smiling, she\nflooded the place with her beauty. Mr. Magee looked at the flabby angels\non the wall, expecting them to hide their faces in shame. But no, they\nstill rode brazenly their unstable clouds.\n\n\"Come in,\" he cried. \"Don't leave me alone here again, please. And tell\nme--is this the gentleman who took the contract for making Mrs. Norton\nhappy?\"\n\n\"I--I can't come in,\" she said, blushing. She seemed to wish to avoid\nhim. \"Yes, that is Mr. Norton.\" She came nearer the easel, and smiled at\nthe late lamented's tonsorial crown. \"I must leave you--just a moment--\"\n\nBilly Magee's heart beat wildly. His breath came fast. He seized her by\nthe hand.\n\n\"You're never going to leave me again,\" he cried. \"Don't you know that?\nI thought you knew. You're mine. I love you. I love you. It's all I can\nsay, my dearest. Look at me--look at me, please.\"\n\n\"It has happened so quickly,\" she murmured. \"Things can't be true when\nthey--happen so quickly.\"\n\n\"A woman's logic,\" said Mr. Magee. \"It has happened. My beautiful girl.\nLook at me.\"\n\nAnd then--she looked. Trembling, flushed, half frightened, half\nexultant, she lifted her eyes to his.\n\n\"My little girl!\" he cried down at her.\n\nA moment longer she held off, and then limply she surrendered. And Billy\nMagee held her close in his arms.\n\n\"Take care of me,\" she whispered. \"I--I love you so.\" Her arm went\ntimidly about his shoulders. \"Do you want to know my name? It's Mary--\"\n\nMary what? The answer was seemingly of no importance, for Mr. Magee's\nlips were on hers, crushing the word at its birth.\n\nSo they stood, amid Mrs. Norton's gloomy objects of art. And presently\nshe asked:\n\n\"How about the book, dear?\"\n\nBut Mr. Magee had forgot.\n\n\"What book?\" he asked.\n\n\"The novel you went to Baldpate to write Don't you remember, dearest--no\nmelodrama, no wild chase, no--love?\"\n\n\"Why--\" Mr. Magee paused for a moment in the joy of his discovery. Then\nhe came back to the greater joy in his arms.\n\n\"Why, darling,\" he explained gently, \"this is it.\"\n\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Seven Keys to Baldpate, by Earl Derr Biggers\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK SEVEN KEYS TO BALDPATE ***\n\n***** This file should be named 30836-8.txt or 30836-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/3\/0\/8\/3\/30836\/\n\nProduced by Tor Martin Kristiansen, Joseph Cooper, Mary\nMeehan and the Online Distributed Proofreading Team at\nhttp:\/\/www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp:\/\/pglaf.org\/fundraising.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":345,"split":"train"}
