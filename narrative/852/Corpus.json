{"ori_id":"c637662cd85593e94dd3338bf7af66a37ebe5563","title":"A Small Boy and Others","context":"A Small Boy and Others\n This memoir tells of a precocious boy who loved the sights and sounds of his childhood but felt reticent about full participation in life. The note is sounded from the first chapters, as James recounts the limitations\u2014and rewards\u2014of the child he was:\n\"For there was the very pattern and measure of all he was to demand: just to be somewhere\u2014almost anywhere would do\u2014and somehow receive an impression or an accession, feel a relation or a vibration. He was to go without many things, ever so many\u2014as all people do in whom contemplation takes so much the place of action; but everywhere...he was to enjoy more than anything the so far from showy practice of wondering and dawdling and gaping: he was really, I think, much to profit by it.\"\nJames clearly suffered from a sense of his inferiority in the \"showy\", active parts of life. His older brother William always seemed superior in ability; his classmates scorned his hopelessness at math and science; even at a party he felt too embarrassed to join in the dancing.\nBut he still observed and fantasized about all his family and his surroundings had to offer. When a cousin of his was told \"don't make a scene,\" he suddenly realized that scenes could be made by telling a story or inventing a play. He went often to the theater and fell forever under its spell. His family met William Thackeray and Charles Dickens on their American tours, and James even remembered Thackeray mock-scolding his sister Alice for her crinoline dress: \"Crinoline? I was suspecting it! So young and so depraved!\"\nIn fact, for all his surface diffidence, James harbored almost Napoleonic dreams of glory as an artist. Near the close of A Small Boy and Others he tells how, in much later years, he dreamed of routing a monstrous attacker and chasing him away through the halls of the Louvre, which he had seen as a child. The small boy, as hesitant and uncertain as he might seem, would triumph over his fears and develop his superb aptitude for narrative fiction.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of A Small Boy and Others, by Henry James\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

For it was to memory in the first place that my\nmain appeal for particulars had to be made; I had been too near a\nwitness of my brother's beginnings of life, and too close a participant,\nby affection, admiration and sympathy, in whatever touched and moved\nhim, not to feel myself in possession even of a greater quantity of\nsignificant truth, a larger handful of the fine substance of history,\nthan I could hope to express or apply. To recover anything like the full\ntreasure of scattered, wasted circumstance was at the same time to live\nover the spent experience itself, so deep and rich and rare, with\nwhatever sadder and sorer intensities, even with whatever poorer and\nthinner passages, after the manner of every one's experience; and the\neffect of this in turn was to find discrimination among the parts of my\nsubject again and again difficult--so inseparably and beautifully they\nseemed to hang together and the comprehensive case to decline mutilation\nor refuse to be treated otherwise than handsomely. This meant that\naspects began to multiply and images to swarm, so far at least as they\nshowed, to appreciation, as true terms and happy values; and that I\nmight positively and exceedingly rejoice in my relation to most of them,\nusing it for all that, as the phrase is, it should be worth. To knock at\nthe door of the past was in a word to see it open to me quite wide--to\nsee the world within begin to \"compose\" with a grace of its own round\nthe primary figure, see it people itself vividly and insistently. Such\nthen is the circle of my commemoration and so much these free and\ncopious notes a labour of love and loyalty. We were, to my sense, the\nblest group of us, such a company of characters and such a picture of\ndifferences, and withal so fused and united and interlocked, that each\nof us, to that fond fancy, pleads for preservation, and that in respect\nto what I speak of myself as possessing I think I shall be ashamed, as\nof a cold impiety, to find any element altogether negligible. To which I\nmay add perhaps that I struggle under the drawback, innate and inbred,\nof seeing the whole content of memory and affection in each enacted and\nrecovered moment, as who should say, in the vivid image and the very\nscene; the light of the only terms in which life has treated me to\nexperience. And I cherish the moment and evoke the image and repaint the\nscene; though meanwhile indeed scarce able to convey how prevailingly\nand almost exclusively, during years and years, the field was animated\nand the adventure conditioned for me by my brother's nearness and that\nplay of genius in him of which I had never had a doubt from the first.\n\nThe \"first\" then--since I retrace our steps to the start, for the\npleasure, strangely mixed though it be, of feeling our small feet plant\nthemselves afresh and artlessly stumble forward again--the first began\nlong ago, far off, and yet glimmers at me there as out of a thin golden\nhaze, with all the charm, for imagination and memory, of pressing\npursuit rewarded, of distinctness in the dimness, of the flush of life\nin the grey, of the wonder of consciousness in everything; everything\nhaving naturally been all the while but the abject little matter of\ncourse. Partly doubtless as the effect of a life, now getting to be a\ntolerably long one, spent in the older world, I see the world of our\nchildhood as very young indeed, young with its own juvenility as well as\nwith ours; as if it wore the few and light garments and had gathered in\nbut the scant properties and breakable toys of the tenderest age, or\nwere at the most a very unformed young person, even a boisterous\nhobbledehoy. It exhaled at any rate a simple freshness, and I catch its\npure breath, at our infantile Albany, as the very air of long summer\nafternoons--occasions tasting of ample leisure, still bookless, yet\nbeginning to be bedless, or cribless; tasting of accessible garden\npeaches in a liberal backward territory that was still almost part of a\ncountry town; tasting of many-sized uncles, aunts, cousins, of strange\nlegendary domestics, inveterately but archaically Irish, and whose\nfamiliar remarks and \"criticism of life\" were handed down, as well as of\ndim family ramifications and local allusions--mystifications\nalways--that flowered into anecdote as into small hard plums; tasting\nabove all of a big much-shaded savoury house in which a softly-sighing\nwidowed grandmother, Catherine Barber by birth, whose attitude was a\nresigned consciousness of complications and accretions, dispensed an\nhospitality seemingly as joyless as it was certainly boundless. What she\n_liked_, dear gentle lady of many cares and anxieties, was the \"fiction\nof the day,\" the novels, at that time promptly pirated, of Mrs. Trollope\nand Mrs. Gore, of Mrs. Marsh, Mrs. Hubback and the Misses Kavanagh and\nAguilar, whose very names are forgotten now, but which used to drive\nher away to quiet corners whence her figure comes back to me bent\nforward on a table with the book held out at a distance and a tall\nsingle candle placed, apparently not at all to her discomfort, in that\nage of sparer and braver habits, straight between the page and her eyes.\nThere is a very animated allusion to one or two of her aspects in the\nfragment of a \"spiritual autobiography,\" the reminiscences of a\nso-called Stephen Dewhurst printed by W. J. (1885) in The Literary\nRemains of Henry James; a reference which has the interest of being very\nnearly as characteristic of my father himself (which his references in\nalmost any connection were wont to be) as of the person or the occasion\nevoked. I had reached my sixteenth year when she died, and as my only\nremembered grandparent she touches the chord of attachment to a\nparticular vibration. She represented for us in our generation the only\nEnglish blood--that of both her own parents--flowing in our veins; I\nconfess that out of that association, for reasons and reasons, I feel\nher image most beneficently bend. We were, as to three parts, of two\nother stocks; and I recall how from far back I reflected--for I see I\nmust have been always reflecting--that, mixed as such a mixture, our\nScotch with our Irish, might be, it had had still a grace to borrow from\nthe third infusion or dimension. If I could freely have chosen moreover\nit was precisely from my father's mother that, fond votary of the finest\nfaith in the vivifying and characterising force of mothers, I should\nhave wished to borrow it; even while conscious that Catherine Barber's\nown people had drawn breath in American air for at least two generations\nbefore her. Our father's father, William James, an Irishman and a\nProtestant born (of county Cavan) had come to America, a very young man\nand then sole of his family, shortly after the Revolutionary War; my\nfather, the second son of the third of the marriages to which the\ncountry of his adoption was liberally to help him, had been born in\nAlbany in 1811. Our maternal greatgrandfather on the father's side, Hugh\nWalsh, had reached our shores from a like Irish home, Killyleagh, county\nDown, somewhat earlier, in 1764, he being then nineteen; he had settled\nat Newburgh-on-the-Hudson, half way to Albany, where some of his\ndescendants till lately lingered. Our maternal greatgrandfather on the\nmother's side--that is our mother's mother's father, Alexander Robertson\nof Polmont near Edinburgh--had likewise crossed the sea in the\nmid-century and prospered in New York very much as Hugh Walsh was\nprospering and William James was still more markedly to prosper, further\nup the Hudson; as unanimous and fortunate beholders of the course of\nwhich admirable stream I like to think of them. I find Alexander\nRobertson inscribed in a wee New York directory of the close of the\ncentury as Merchant; and our childhood in that city was passed, as to\nsome of its aspects, in a sense of the afterglow, reduced and\ncircumscribed, it is true, but by no means wholly inanimate, of his\nshining solidity.\n\nThe sweet taste of Albany probably lurked most in its being our admired\nantithesis to New York; it was holiday, whereas New York was home; at\nleast that presently came to be the relation, for to my very very first\nfleeting vision, I apprehend, Albany itself must have been the scene\nexhibited. Our parents had gone there for a year or two to be near our\ngrandmother on their return from their first (that is our mother's\nfirst) visit to Europe, which had quite immediately followed my birth,\nwhich appears to have lasted some year and a half, and of which I shall\nhave another word to say. The Albany experiment would have been then\ntheir first founded housekeeping, since I make them out to have betaken\nthemselves for the winter following their marriage to the ancient Astor\nHouse--not indeed at that time ancient, but the great and appointed\nmodern hotel of New York, the only one of such pretensions, and which\nsomehow continued to project its massive image, that of a great square\nblock of granite with vast dark warm interiors, across some of the later\nand more sensitive stages of my infancy. Clearly--or I should perhaps\nrather say dimly--recourse to that hospitality was again occasionally\nhad by our parents; who had originally had it to such a happy end that\non January 9th, 1842, my elder brother had come into the world there. It\nremained a tradition with him that our father's friend from an early\ntime, R. W. Emerson, then happening to be in New York and under that\nconvenient roof, was proudly and pressingly \"taken upstairs\" to admire\nand give his blessing to the lately-born babe who was to become the\nsecond American William James. The blessing was to be renewed, I may\nmention, in the sense that among the impressions of the next early years\nI easily distinguish that of the great and urbane Emerson's occasional\npresence in Fourteenth Street, a centre of many images, where the\nparental tent was before long to pitch itself and rest awhile. I am\ninterested for the moment, however, in identifying the scene of our very\nfirst perceptions--of my very own at least, which I can here best speak\nfor.\n\nOne of these, and probably the promptest in order, was that of my\nbrother's occupying a place in the world to which I couldn't at all\naspire--to any approach to which in truth I seem to myself ever\nconscious of having signally forfeited a title. It glimmers back to me\nthat I quite definitely and resignedly thought of him as in the most\nexemplary manner already beforehand with me, already seated at his task\nwhen the attempt to drag me crying and kicking to the first hour of my\neducation failed on the threshold of the Dutch House in Albany after the\nfashion I have glanced at in a collection of other pages than these\n(just as I remember to have once borrowed a hint from our grandmother's\n\"interior\" in a work of imagination). That failure of my powers or that\nindifference to them, my retreat shrieking from the Dutch House, was to\nleave him once for all already there an embodied demonstration of the\npossible--already wherever it might be that there was a question of my\narriving, when arriving at all, belatedly and ruefully; as if he had\ngained such an advance of me in his sixteen months' experience of the\nworld before mine began that I never for all the time of childhood and\nyouth in the least caught up with him or overtook him. He was always\nround the corner and out of sight, coming back into view but at his\nhours of extremest ease. We were never in the same schoolroom, in the\nsame game, scarce even in step together or in the same phase at the same\ntime; when our phases overlapped, that is, it was only for a moment--he\nwas clean out before I had got well in. How far he had really at any\nmoment dashed forward it is not for me now to attempt to say; what\ncomes to me is that I at least hung inveterately and woefully back, and\nthat this relation alike to our interests and to each other seemed\nproper and preappointed. I lose myself in wonder at the loose ways, the\nstrange process of waste, through which nature and fortune may deal on\noccasion with those whose faculty for application is all and only in\ntheir imagination and their sensibility. There may be during those\nbewildered and brooding years so little for them to \"show\" that I liken\nthe individual dunce--as he so often must appear--to some commercial\ntraveller who has lost the key to his packed case of samples and can but\npass for a fool while other exhibitions go forward.\n\nI achieve withal a dim remembrance of my final submission, though it is\nthe faintest ghost of an impression and consists but of the bright blur\nof a dame's schoolroom, a mere medium for small piping shuffling sound\nand suffered heat, as well as for the wistfulness produced by\n\"glimmering squares\" that were fitfully screened, though not to any\nrevival of cheer, by a huge swaying, yet dominant object. This dominant\nobject, the shepherdess of the flock, was Miss Bayou or Bayhoo--I\nrecover but the alien sound of her name, which memory caresses only\nbecause she may have been of like race with her temple of learning,\nwhich faced my grandmother's house in North Pearl Street and really\njustified its exotic claim by its yellow archaic gable-end: I think of\nthe same as of brick baked in the land of dykes and making a series of\nsmall steps from the base of the gable to the point. These images are\nsubject, I confess, to a soft confusion--which is somehow consecrated,\nnone the less, and out of which, with its shade of contributory truth,\nsome sort of scene insists on glancing. The very flush of the uneven\nbricks of the pavement lives in it, the very smell of the street\ncobbles, the imputed grace of the arching umbrage--I see it all as from\nunder trees; the form of Steuben Street, which crossed our view, as\nsteep even to the very essence of adventure, with a summit, and still\nmore with a nethermost and riskiest incline, very far away. There lives\nin it the aspect of the other house--the other and much smaller than my\ngrandmother's, conveniently near it and within sight; which was\npinkish-red picked out with white, whereas my grandmother's was\ngreyish-brown and very grave, and which must have stood back a little\nfrom the street, as I seem even now to swing, or at least to perch, on a\nrelaxed gate of approach that was conceived to work by an iron chain\nweighted with a big ball; all under a spreading tree again and with the\nhigh, oh so high white stone steps (mustn't they have been marble?) and\nfan-lighted door of the pinkish-red front behind me. I lose myself in\nravishment before the marble and the pink. There were other houses\ntoo--one of them the occasion of the first \"paid\" visit that struggles\nwith my twilight of social consciousness; a call with my father,\nconveying me presumably for fond exhibition (since if my powers were not\nexhibitional my appearance and my long fair curls, of which I distinctly\nremember the lachrymose sacrifice, suppositiously were), on one of our\naunts, the youngest of his three sisters, lately married and who,\npredestined to an early death, hovers there for me, softly spectral, in\nlong light \"front\" ringlets, the fashion of the time and the capital\nsign of all our paternal aunts seemingly; with the remembered\nenhancement of her living in Elk Street, the name itself vaguely\nportentous, as through beasts of the forest not yet wholly exorcised,\nand more or less under the high brow of that Capitol which, as aloft\nsomewhere and beneath the thickest shades of all, loomed, familiar yet\nimpressive, at the end of almost any Albany vista of reference. I have\nseen other capitols since, but the whole majesty of the matter must have\nbeen then distilled into my mind--even though the connection was\nindirect and the concrete image, that of the primitive structure, long\nsince pretentiously and insecurely superseded--so that, later on, the\nimpression was to find itself, as the phrase is, discounted. Had it not\nmoreover been reinforced at the time, for that particular Capitoline\nhour, by the fact that our uncle, our aunt's husband, was a son of Mr.\nMartin Van Buren, and that _he_ was the President? This at least led the\nimagination on--or leads in any case my present imagination of that one;\nministering to what I have called the soft confusion.\n\nThe confusion clears, however, though the softness remains, when,\nceasing to press too far backward, I meet the ampler light of conscious\nand educated little returns to the place; for the education of New York,\nenjoyed up to my twelfth year, failed to blight its romantic appeal. The\nimages I really distinguish flush through the maturer medium, but with\nthe sense of them only the more wondrous. The other house, the house of\nmy parents' limited early sojourn, becomes that of those of our cousins,\nnumerous at that time, who pre-eminently figured for us; the various\nbrood presided over by my father's second sister, Catherine James, who\nhad married at a very early age Captain Robert Temple, U.S.A. Both these\nparents were to die young, and their children, six in number, the two\neldest boys, were very markedly to people our preliminary scene; this\nbeing true in particular of three of them, the sharply differing\nbrothers and the second sister, Mary Temple, radiant and rare,\nextinguished in her first youth, but after having made an impression on\nmany persons, and on ourselves not least, which was to become in the\nharmonious circle, for all time, matter of sacred legend and reference,\nof associated piety. Those and others with them were the numerous\ndawnings on which in many cases the deepening and final darknesses were\nso soon to follow: our father's family was to offer such a chronicle of\nearly deaths, arrested careers, broken promises, orphaned children. It\nsounds cold-blooded, but part of the charm of our grandmother's house\nfor us--or I should perhaps but speak for myself--was in its being so\nmuch and so sociably a nurseried and playroomed orphanage. The children\nof her lost daughters and daughters-in-law overflowed there, mainly as\ngirls; on whom the surviving sons-in-law and sons occasionally and most\ntrustingly looked in. Parentally bereft cousins were somehow more\nthrilling than parentally provided ones; and most thrilling when, in the\nodd fashion of that time, they were sent to school in New York as a\npreliminary to their being sent to school in Europe. They spent scraps\nof holidays with us in Fourteenth Street, and I think my first childish\nconception of the enviable lot, formed amid these associations, was to\nbe so little fathered or mothered, so little sunk in the short range,\nthat the romance of life seemed to lie in some constant improvisation,\nby vague overhovering authorities, of new situations and horizons. We\nwere intensely domesticated, yet for the very reason perhaps that we\nfelt our young bonds easy; and they were so easy compared to other small\nplights of which we had stray glimpses that my first assured conception\nof true richness was that we should be sent separately off among cold or\neven cruel aliens in order to be there thrillingly homesick.\nHomesickness was a luxury I remember craving from the tenderest age--a\nluxury of which I was unnaturally, or at least prosaically, deprived.\nOur motherless cousin Augustus Barker came up from Albany to the\nInstitution Charlier--unless it was, as I suspect, a still earlier\nspecimen, with a name that fades from me, of that type of French\nestablishment for boys which then and for years after so incongruously\nflourished in New York; and though he professed a complete satisfaction\nwith pleasures tasted in our innocent society I felt that he was engaged\nin a brave and strenuous adventure while we but hugged the comparatively\nsafe shore.\n\n\n\n\nII\n\n\nWe were day-boys, William and I, at dispensaries of learning the number\nand succession of which to-day excite my wonder; we couldn't have\nchanged oftener, it strikes me as I look back, if our presence had been\ninveterately objected to, and yet I enjoy an inward certainty that, my\nbrother being vividly bright and I quite blankly innocuous, this\nreproach was never brought home to our house. It was an humiliation to\nme at first, small boys though we were, that our instructors kept being\ninstructresses and thereby a grave reflection both on our attainments\nand our spirit. A bevy of these educative ladies passes before me, I\nstill possess their names; as for instance that of Mrs. Daly and that of\nMiss Rogers (previously of the \"Chelsea Female Institute,\" though at the\nmoment of Sixth Avenue this latter), whose benches indeed my brother\ndidn't haunt, but who handled us literally with gloves--I still see the\nelegant objects as Miss Rogers beat time with a long black ferule to\nsome species of droning chant or chorus in which we spent most of our\nhours; just as I see her very tall and straight and spare, in a light\nblue dress, her firm face framed in long black glossy ringlets and the\nstamp of the Chelsea Female Institute all over her. Mrs. Daly, clearly\nthe immediate successor to the nebulous Miss Bayou, remains quite\nsubstantial--perhaps because the sphere of her small influence has\nsucceeded in not passing away, up to this present writing; so that in\ncertain notes on New York published a few years since I was moved to\nrefer to it with emotion as one of the small red houses on the south\nside of Waverley Place that really carry the imagination back to a\nvanished social order. They carry mine to a stout red-faced lady with\ngrey hair and a large apron, the latter convenience somehow suggesting,\nas she stood about with a resolute air, that she viewed her little\npupils as so many small slices cut from the loaf of life and on which\nshe was to dab the butter of arithmetic and spelling, accompanied by way\nof jam with a light application of the practice of prize-giving. I\nrecall an occasion indeed, I must in justice mention, when the jam\nreally was thick--my only memory of a schoolfeast, strange to say,\nthroughout our young annals: something uncanny in the air of the\nschoolroom at the unwonted evening or late afternoon hour, and tables\nthat seemed to me prodigiously long and on which the edibles were chunky\nand sticky. The stout red-faced lady must have been Irish, as the name\nshe bore imported--or do I think so but from the indescribably Irish\nlook of her revisited house? It refers itself at any rate to a New York\nage in which a little more or a little less of the colour was scarce\nnotable in the general flush.\n\nOf pure unimported strain, however, were Miss Sedgwick and Mrs. Wright\n(Lavinia D.), the next figures in the procession--the procession that\nwas to wind up indeed with two foreign recruits, small brown snappy\nMademoiselle Delavigne, who plied us with the French tongue at home and\nwho had been introduced to us as the niece--or could it have been the\ngrandniece?--of the celebrated Casimir, and a large Russian lady in an\nextraordinarily short cape (I like to recall the fashion of short capes)\nof the same stuff as her dress, and Merovingian sidebraids that seemed\nto require the royal crown of Fr\u00c3\u00a9d\u00c3\u00a9gonde or Brun\u00c3\u00a9haut to complete their\neffect. This final and aggravational representative of the compromising\nsex looms to my mind's eye, I should add, but as the creature of an\nhour, in spite of her having been domiciled with us; whereas I think of\nMademoiselle Delavigne as flitting in and out on quick, fine, more or\nless cloth-shod feet of exemplary neatness, the flat-soled feet of Louis\nPhilippe and of the female figures in those volumes of Gavarni then\nactual, then contemporaneous, which were kept in a piece of furniture\nthat stood between the front-parlour windows in Fourteenth Street,\ntogether with a set of B\u00c3\u00a9ranger enriched by steel engravings to the\nstrange imagery of which I so wonderingly responded that all other art\nof illustration, ever since, has been for me comparatively weak and\ncold. These volumes and the tall entrancing folios of Nash's\nlithographed Mansions of England in the Olden Time formed a store\nlending itself particularly to distribution on the drawingroom carpet,\nwith concomitant pressure to the same surface of the small student's\nstomach and relieving agitation of his backward heels. I make out that\nit had decidedly been given to Mlle. Delavigne to represent to my first\nperception personal France; she was, besides not being at all pink or\nshy, oval and fluent and mistress somehow of the step--the step of\nlevity that involved a whisk of her short skirts; there she was, to the\nlife, on the page of Gavarni, attesting its reality, and there again did\nthat page in return (I speak not of course of the unplumbed depths of\nthe appended text) attest her own felicity. I was later on to feel--that\nis I was to learn--how many impressions and appearances, how large a\nsense of things, her type and tone prefigured. The evanescence of the\nlarge Russian lady, whom I think of as rather rank, I can't express it\notherwise, may have been owing to some question of the purity of her\naccent in French; it was one of her attributes and her grounds of appeal\nto us that she had come straight from Siberia, and it is distinct to me\nthat the purity was challenged by a friend of the house, and\nwithout--pathetically enough!--provoking the only answer, the plea that\nthe missing Atticism would have been wasted on young barbarians. The\nSiberian note, on our inmate's part, may perhaps have been the least of\nher incongruities; she was above all too big for a little job, towered\nover us doubtless too heroically; and her proportions hover but to lose\nthemselves--with the successors to her function awaiting us a little\nlonger.\n\nMeanwhile, to revert an instant, if the depressed consciousness of our\nstill more or less quailing, educationally, beneath the female eye--and\nthere was as well the deeper depth, there was the degrading fact, that\nwith us literally consorted and contended Girls, that we sat and strove,\neven though we drew the line at playing with them and at knowing them,\nwhen not of the swarming cousinship, at home--if that felt awkwardness\ndidn't exactly coincide with the ironic effect of \"Gussy's\" appearances,\nhis emergence from rich mystery and his return to it, our state was but\ncomparatively the braver: he always had so much more to tell us than we\ncould possibly have to tell him. On reflection I see that the most\ncompletely rueful period couldn't after all greatly have prolonged\nitself; since the female eye last bent on us would have been that of\nLavinia D. Wright, to our connection with whom a small odd reminiscence\nattaches a date. A little schoolmate displayed to me with pride, while\nthe connection lasted, a beautiful coloured, a positively iridescent and\ngilded card representing the first of all the \"great exhibitions\" of our\nage, the London Crystal Palace of 1851--his father having lately gone\nout to it and sent him the dazzling memento. In 1851 I was eight years\nold and my brother scarce more than nine; in addition to which it is\ndistinct to me in the first place that we were never faithful long, or\nfor more than one winter, to the same studious scene, and in the second\nthat among our instructors Mrs. Lavinia had no successor of her own sex\nunless I count Mrs. Vredenburg, of New Brighton, where we spent the\nsummer of 1854, when I had reached the age of eleven and found myself\nbewildered by recognition of the part that \"attendance at school\" was so\nmeanly to play in the hitherto unclouded long vacation. This was true at\nleast for myself and my next younger brother, Wilky, who, under the\npresumption now dawning of his \"community of pursuits\" with my own, was\nfrom that moment, off and on, for a few years, my extremely easy\nyokefellow and playfellow. On William, charged with learning--I thought\nof him inveterately from our younger time as charged with learning--no\nsuch trick was played; he rested or roamed, that summer, on his\naccumulations; a fact which, as I was sure I saw these more and more\nrichly accumulate, didn't in the least make me wonder. It comes back to\nme in truth that I had been prepared for anything by his having said to\nme toward the end of our time at Lavinia D's and with characteristic\nauthority--his enjoyment of it coming from my character, I mean, quite\nas much as from his own--that that lady was a very able woman, as shown\nby the Experiments upstairs. He was upstairs of course, and I was down,\nand I scarce even knew what Experiments were, beyond their indeed\nrequiring capability. The region of their performance was William's\nnatural sphere, though I recall that I had a sense of peeping into it to\na thrilled effect on seeing our instructress illustrate the proper way\nto extinguish a candle. She firmly pressed the flame between her thumb\nand her two forefingers, and, on my remarking that I didn't see how she\ncould do it, promptly replied that I of course couldn't do it myself (as\n_he_ could) because I should be afraid.\n\nThat reflection on my courage awakes another echo of the same scant\nseason--since the test involved must have been that of our taking our\nway home through Fourth Avenue from some point up town, and Mrs.\nWright's situation in East Twenty-first Street was such a point. The\nHudson River Railroad was then in course of construction, or was being\nmade to traverse the upper reaches of the city, through that part of\nwhich raged, to my young sense, a riot of explosion and a great shouting\nand waving of red flags when the gunpowder introduced into the rocky\nsoil was about to take effect. It was our theory that our passage there,\nin the early afternoon, was beset with danger, and our impression that\nwe saw fragments of rock hurtle through the air and smite to the earth\nanother and yet another of the persons engaged or exposed. The point of\nhonour, among several of us, was of course nobly to defy the danger, and\nI feel again the emotion with which I both hoped and feared that the red\nflags, lurid signals descried from afar, would enable or compel us to\nrenew the feat. That I didn't for myself inveterately renew it I seem to\ninfer from the memory of other perambulations of the period--as to which\nI am divided between their still present freshness and my sense of\nperhaps making too much of these tiny particles of history. My stronger\nrule, however, I confess, and the one by which I must here consistently\nbe guided, is that, from the moment it is a question of projecting a\npicture, no particle that counts for memory or is appreciable to the\nspirit _can_ be too tiny, and that experience, in the name of which one\nspeaks, is all compact of them and shining with them. There was at any\nrate another way home, with other appeals, which consisted of getting\nstraight along westward to Broadway, a sphere of a different order of\nfascination and bristling, as I seem to recall, with more vivid aspects,\ngreater curiosities and wonderments. _The_ curiosity was of course the\ncountry-place, as I supposed it to be, on the northeast corner of\nEighteenth Street, if I am not mistaken; a big brown house in \"grounds\"\npeopled with animal life, which, little as its site may appear to know\nit to-day, lingered on into considerably later years. I have but to\nclose my eyes in order to open them inwardly again, while I lean against\nthe tall brown iron rails and peer through, to a romantic view of\nbrowsing and pecking and parading creatures, not numerous, but all of\ndistinguished appearance: two or three elegant little cows of refined\nform and colour, two or three nibbling fawns and a larger company, above\nall, of peacocks and guineafowl, with, doubtless--though as to this I am\nvague--some of the commoner ornaments of the barnyard. I recognise that\nthe scene as I evoke it fails of grandeur; but it none the less had for\nme the note of greatness--all of which but shows of course what a very\ntown-bred small person I was, and was to remain.\n\nI see myself moreover as somehow always alone in these and like New York\n_fl\u00c3\u00a2neries_ and contemplations, and feel how the sense of my being so,\nbeing at any rate master of my short steps, such as they were, through\nall the beguiling streets, was probably the very savour of each of my\nchance feasts. Which stirs in me at the same time some wonder at the\nliberty of range and opportunity of adventure allowed to my tender age;\nthough the puzzle may very well drop, after all, as I ruefully reflect\nthat I couldn't have been judged at home reckless or adventurous. What I\nlook back to as my infant license can only have had for its ground some\ntimely conviction on the part of my elders that the only form of riot or\nrevel ever known to me would be that of the visiting mind. Wasn't I\nmyself for that matter even at that time all acutely and yet resignedly,\neven quite fatalistically, aware of what to think of this? I at any rate\nwatch the small boy dawdle and gape again. I smell the cold dusty paint\nand iron as the rails of the Eighteenth Street corner rub his\ncontemplative nose, and, feeling him foredoomed, withhold from him no\ngrain of my sympathy. He is a convenient little image or warning of all\nthat was to be for him, and he might well have been even happier than he\nwas. For there was the very pattern and measure of all he was to demand:\njust to _be_ somewhere--almost anywhere would do--and somehow receive an\nimpression or an accession, feel a relation or a vibration. He was to go\nwithout many things, ever so many--as all persons do in whom\ncontemplation takes so much the place of action; but everywhere, in the\nyears that came soon after, and that in fact continued long, in the\nstreets of great towns, in New York still for some time, and then for a\nwhile in London, in Paris, in Geneva, wherever it might be, he was to\nenjoy more than anything the so far from showy practice of wondering and\ndawdling and gaping: he was really, I think, much to profit by it. What\nit at all appreciably gave him--that is gave him in producible\nform--would be difficult to state; but it seems to him, as he even now\nthus indulges himself, an education like another: feeling, as he has\ncome to do more and more, that no education avails for the intelligence\nthat doesn't stir in it some subjective passion, and that on the other\nhand almost anything that does so act is largely educative, however\nsmall a figure the process might make in a scheme of training. Strange\nindeed, furthermore, are some of the things that _have_ stirred a\nsubjective passion--stirred it, I mean, in young persons predisposed to\na more or less fine inspired application.\n\n\n\n\nIII\n\n\nBut I positively dawdle and gape here--I catch myself in the act; so\nthat I take up the thread of fond reflection that guides me through that\nmystification of the summer school, which I referred to a little way\nback, at the time when the Summer School as known in America to-day was\nso deep in the bosom of the future. The seat of acquisition I speak of\nmust have been contiguous to the house we occupied--I recall it as most\nintimately and objectionably near--and carried on in the interest of\nthose parents from New York who, in villeggiatura under the queer\nconditions of those days, with the many modern mitigations of the\ngregarious lot still unrevealed and the many refinements on the\nindividual one still undeveloped, welcomed almost any influence that\nmight help at all to form their children to civility. Yet I remember\nthat particular influence as more noisy and drowsy and dusty than\nanything else--as to which it must have partaken strongly of the general\nnature of New Brighton; a neighbourhood that no apt agency whatever had\nup to that time concerned itself to fashion, and that was indeed to\nremain shabbily shapeless for years; since I recall almost as dire an\nimpression of it received in the summer of 1875. I seem more or less to\nhave begun life, for that matter, with impressions of New Brighton;\nthere comes back to me another, considerably more infantile than that of\n1854, so infantile indeed that I wonder at its having stuck--that of a\nplace called the Pavilion, which must have been an hotel sheltering us\nfor July and August, and the form of which to childish retrospect,\nunprejudiced by later experience, was that of a great Greek temple\nshining over blue waters in the splendour of a white colonnade and a\ngreat yellow pediment. The elegant image remained, though imprinted in a\nchild so small as to be easily portable by a stout nurse, I remember,\nand not less easily duckable; I gasp again, and was long to gasp, with\nthe sense of salt immersion received at her strong hands. Wonderful\naltogether in fact, I find as I write, the quantity, the intensity of\npicture recoverable from even the blankest and tenderest state of the\nlittle canvas.\n\nI connect somehow with the Pavilion period a visit paid with my\nfather--who decidedly must have liked to take me about, I feel so rich\nin that general reminiscence--to a family whom we reached in what struck\nme as a quite lovely embowered place, on a very hot day, and among whom\nluxuries and eccentricities flourished together. They were numerous, the\nmembers of this family, they were beautiful, they partook of their\nmeals, or were at the moment partaking of one, out of doors, and the\nthen pre-eminent figure in the group was a very big Newfoundland dog on\nwhose back I was put to ride. That must have been my first vision of the\nliberal life--though I further ask myself what my age could possibly\nhave been when my weight was so fantastically far from hinting at later\ndevelopments. But the romance of the hour was particularly in what I\nhave called the eccentric note, the fact that the children, my\nentertainers, riveted my gaze to stockingless and shoeless legs and\nfeet, conveying somehow at the same time that they were not poor and\ndestitute but rich and provided--just as I took their garden-feast for a\nsign of overflowing food--and that their state as of children of nature\nwas a refinement of freedom and grace. They were to become great and\nbeautiful, the household of that glimmering vision, they were to figure\nhistorically, heroically, and serve great public ends; but always, to my\nremembering eyes and fond fancy, they were to move through life as with\nthe bare white feet of that original preferred fairness and wildness.\nThis is rank embroidery, but the old surface itself insists on\nspreading--it waits at least with an air of its own. The rest is\nsilence; I can--extraordinary encumbrance even for the most doating of\nparents on a morning call--but have returned with my father to \"our\nhotel\"; since I feel that I must not only to this but to a still further\nextent face the historic truth that we were for considerable periods,\nduring our earliest time, nothing less than hotel children. Between the\nfar-off and the later phases at New Brighton stretched a series of\nsummers that had seen us all regularly installed for a couple of months\nat an establishment passing in the view of that simpler age for a vast\ncaravansery--the Hamilton House, on the south Long Island shore, so\ncalled from its nearness to the Fort of that name, which had Fort\nLafayette, the Bastille of the Civil War, out in the channel before it\nand which probably cast a stronger spell upon the spirit of our\nchildhood, William's and mine at least, than any scene presented to us\nup to our reaching our teens.\n\nI find that I draw from the singularly unobliterated memory of the\nparticulars of all that experience the power quite to glory in our\nshame; of so entrancing an interest did I feel it at the time to _be_ an\nhotel child, and so little would I have exchanged my lot with that of\nany small person more privately bred. We were private enough in all\nconscience, I think I must have felt, the rest of the year; and at what\nage mustn't I quite have succumbed to the charm of the world seen in a\nlarger way? For there, incomparably, was the chance to dawdle and gape;\nthere were human appearances in endless variety and on the\nexhibition-stage of a piazza that my gape measured almost as by miles;\nit was even as if I had become positively conscious that the social\nscene so peopled would pretty well always say more to me than anything\nelse. What it did say I of course but scantly understood; but I none the\nless knew it spoke, and I listened to its voice, I seem to recall, very\nmuch as \"young Edwin,\" in Dr. Beattie's poem, listened to the roar of\ntempests and torrents from the nobler eminence of beetling crags and in\nexposure to still deeper abysses. I cling for the moment, however, to\nthe small story of our Vredenburg summer, as we were for long afterwards\ninvidiously to brand it; the more that it so plays its part in\nillustration, under the light of a later and happier age, of the growth,\nwhen not rather of the arrest, of manners and customs roundabout our\nbirthplace. I think we had never been so much as during these particular\nmonths disinherited of the general and public amenities that reinforce\nfor the young private precept and example--disinherited in favour of\ndust and glare and mosquitoes and pigs and shanties and rumshops, of no\nwalks and scarce more drives, of a repeated no less than of a strong\nemphasis on the more sordid sides of the Irish aspect in things. There\nwas a castellated residence on the hill above us--very high I remember\nsupposing the hill and very stately the structure; it had towers and\nviews and pretensions and belonged to a Colonel, whom we thought very\nhandsome and very costumed, (as if befrogged and high-booted, which he\ncouldn't have been at all, only _ought_ to have been, would even\ncertainly have been at a higher pitch of social effect,) and whose son\nand heir, also very handsome and known familiarly and endearingly as\nChick, had a velvet coat and a pony and I think spurs, all luxuries we\nwere without, and was cousin to boys, the De Coppets, whom we had come\nto know at our school of the previous winter and who somehow--doubtless\npartly as guests of the opulent Chick--hovered again about the field of\nidleness.\n\nThe De Coppets, particularly in the person of the first-born Louis, had\nbeen a value to us, or at any rate to me--for though I was, in common\nwith my elders then, unacquainted with the application of that word as I\nuse it here, what was my incipient sense of persons and things, what\nwere my first stirred observant and imaginative reactions,\ndiscriminations and categories, but a vague groping for it? The De\nCoppets (again as more especially and most impressively interpreted by\nthe subtle Louis) enjoyed the pre-eminence of being European; they had\ndropped during the scholastic term of 1853-4 straight from the lake of\nGeneva into the very bosom of Mr. Richard Pulling Jenks's select resort\nfor young gentlemen, then situated in Broadway below Fourth Street; and\nhad lately been present at an historic pageant--whether or no\ncelebrating the annals of the town of Coppet I know not--in which\nrepresentatives of their family had figured in armour and on horseback\nas the Barons (to our comprehension) de Coup or Cou. Their father was\nthus of the Canton de Vaud--only their mother had been native among\nourselves and sister to the Colonel of the castellations. But what was\nthe most vivid mark of the brothers, and vividest on the part of the\nsupersubtle Louis, was his French treatment of certain of our native\nlocal names, Ohio and Iowa for instance, which he rendered, as to their\nseparate vowels, with a daintiness and a delicacy invidious and\nimperturbable, so that he might have been Chateaubriand declaiming Les\nNatchez at Madame R\u00c3\u00a9camier's--O-ee-oh and Ee-o-wah; a proceeding in him,\na violence offered to his serried circle of little staring and glaring\nNew Yorkers supplied with the usual allowance of fists and boot-toes,\nwhich, as it was clearly conscious, I recollect thinking unsurpassed for\ncool calm courage. Those _were_ the right names--which we owed wholly to\nthe French explorers and Jesuit Fathers; so much the worse for us if we\nvulgarly didn't know it. I lose myself in admiration of the consistency,\nthe superiority, the sublimity, of the not at all game-playing, yet in\nhis own way so singularly sporting, Louis. He was naturally and\nincorruptibly French--as, so oddly, I have known other persons of both\nsexes to be whose English was naturally and incorruptibly American; the\nappearance being thus that the possession of indigenous English alone\nforms the adequate barrier and the assured racial ground. (Oh the queer\nreversions observed on the part of Latinized compatriots in the course\nof a long life--the remarkable drops from the quite current French or\nItalian to the comparatively improvised native idiom, with the resulting\neffect of the foreign tongue used as a domestic and the domestic, that\nis the original American, used as a foreign tongue, or without inherited\nconfidence!)\n\nLouis De Coppet, though theoretically American and domiciled, was\n_naturally_ French, and so pressed further home to me that \"sense of\nEurope\" to which I feel that my very earliest consciousness waked--a\nperversity that will doubtless appear to ask for all the justification I\ncan supply and some of which I shall presently attempt to give. He\nopened vistas, and I count ever as precious anyone, everyone, who\nbetimes does that for the small straining vision; performing this office\nnever so much, doubtless, as when, during that summer, he invited me to\ncollaborate with him in the production of a romance which _il se fit\nfort_ to get printed, to get published, when success, or in other words\ncompletion, should crown our effort. Our effort, alas, failed of the\ncrown, in spite of sundry solemn and mysterious meetings--so much\ndevoted, I seem to remember, to the publishing question that others more\nfundamental dreadfully languished; leaving me convinced, however, that\nmy friend would have got our fiction published if he could only have got\nit written. I think of my participation in this vain dream as of the\nvery first gage of visiting approval offered to the exercise of a\ngift--though quite unable to conceive my companion's ground for\nsuspecting a gift of which I must at that time quite have failed to\nexhibit a single in the least \"phenomenal\" symptom. It had none the less\nby his overtures been handsomely _imputed_ to me; that was in a manner a\nbeginning--a small start, yet not wholly unattended with bravery. Louis\nDe Coppet, I must add, brought to light later on, so far as I know, no\ncompositions of his own; we met him long after in Switzerland and\neventually heard of his having married a young Russian lady and settled\nat Nice. If I drop on his memory this apology for a bay-leaf it is from\nthe fact of his having given the earliest, or at least the most\npersonal, tap to that pointed prefigurement of the manners of \"Europe,\"\nwhich, inserted wedge-like, if not to say peg-like, into my young\nallegiance, was to split the tender organ into such unequal halves. His\nthe toy hammer that drove in the very point of the golden nail.\n\nIt was as if there had been a mild magic in that breath, however scant,\nof another world; but when I ask myself what element of the pleasing or\nthe agreeable may have glimmered through the then general, the outer and\nenveloping conditions, I recover many more of the connections in which\nforms and civilities lapsed beyond repair than of those in which they\nstruggled at all successfully. It is for some record of the question of\ntaste, of the consciousness of an \u00c3\u00a6sthetic appeal, as reflected in forms\nand aspects, that I shall like best to testify; as the promise and the\ndevelopment of these things on our earlier American scene are the more\ninteresting to trace for their doubtless demanding a degree of the finer\nattention. The plain and happy profusions and advances and successes, as\none looks back, reflect themselves at every turn; the quick beats of\nmaterial increase and multiplication, with plenty of people to tell of\nthem and throw up their caps for them; but the edifying matters to\nrecapture would be the adventures of the \"higher criticism\" so far as\nthere was any--and so far too as it might bear on the real quality and\nvirtue of things; the state of manners, the terms of intercourse, the\ncare for excellence, the sense of appearances, the intellectual reaction\ngenerally. However, any breasting of those deep waters must be but in\nthe form for me of an occasional dip. It meanwhile fairly overtakes and\narrests me here as a contributive truth that our general medium of life\nin the situation I speak of was such as to make a large defensive\nverandah, which seems to have very stoutly and completely surrounded us,\nplay more or less the part of a raft of rescue in too high a tide--too\nhigh a tide there beneath us, as I recover it, of the ugly and the\ngraceless. My particular perspective may magnify a little wildly--when\nit doesn't even more weirdly diminish; but I read into the great hooded\nand guarded resource in question an evidential force: as if it must\nreally have played for us, so far as its narrowness and its exposure\npermitted, the part of a buffer-state against the wilderness immediately\nnear, that of the empty, the unlovely and the mean. Interposing a little\nease, didn't it interpose almost all the ease we knew?--so that when\namiable friends, arriving from New York by the boat, came to see us,\nthere was no rural view for them but that of our great shame, a view of\nthe pigs and the shanties and the loose planks and scattered refuse and\nrude public ways; never even a field-path for a gentle walk or a garden\nnook in afternoon shade. I recall my prompt distaste, a strange\nprecocity of criticism, for so much aridity--since of what lost Arcadia,\nat that age, had I really had the least glimpse?\n\nOur scant margin must have affected me more nobly, I should in justice\nadd, when old Mrs. L. passed or hovered, for she sometimes caustically\njoined the circle and sometimes, during the highest temperatures, which\nwere very high that summer, but flitted across it in a single flowing\ngarment, as we amazedly conceived; one of the signs of that grand\nimpertinence, I supposed, which belonged to \"dowagers\"--dowagers who\nwere recognised characters and free speakers, doing and saying what they\nliked. This ancient lady was lodged in some outlying tract of the\nmany-roomed house, which in more than one quarter stretched away into\nmystery; but the piazza, to which she had access, was unbroken, and\nwhenever she strayed from her own territory she swam afresh into ours. I\ndefinitely remember that, having heard and perhaps read of dowagers,\nwho, as I was aware, had scarce been provided for in our social scheme,\nI said to myself at first sight of our emphatic neighbour, a person\nclearly used to exceptional deference, \"This must be a perfect\nspecimen;\" which was somehow very wonderful. The absolute first sight,\nhowever, had preceded the New Brighton summer, and it makes me lose\nmyself in a queer dim vision, all the obscurities attendant on my having\nbeen present, as a very small boy indeed, at an evening entertainment\nwhere Mrs. L. figured in an attire that is still vivid to me: a blue\nsatin gown, a long black lace shawl and a head-dress consisting in\nequally striking parts of a brown wig, a plume of some sort waving over\nit and a band or fillet, whether of some precious metal or not I forget,\nkeeping it in place by the aid of a precious stone which adorned the\ncentre of her brow. Such was my first view of the _f\u00c3\u00a9ronni\u00c3\u00a8re_ of our\ngrandmothers, when not of our greatgrandmothers. I see its wearer at\nthis day bend that burdened brow upon me in a manner sufficiently awful,\nwhile her knuckly white gloves toyed with a large fan and a vinaigrette\nattached to her thumb by a chain; and as she was known to us afterwards\nfor a friend of my Albany grandmother's it may have been as a tribute to\nthis tie that she allowed me momentarily to engage her attention. _Then_\nit predominantly must have been that I knew her for a dowager--though\nthis was a light in which I had never considered my grandmother herself;\nbut what I have quite lost the clue to is the question of my\nextraordinary footing in such an assembly, the occasion of a dance of my\nelders, youthful elders but young married people, into which, really, my\nmother, as a participant, must have introduced me.\n\n\n\n\nIV\n\n\nIt took place in the house of our cousins Robert and Kitty Emmet the\nelder--for we were to have two cousin Kittys of that ilk and yet another\nconsanguineous Robert at least; the latter name being naturally, among\nthem all, of a pious, indeed of a glorious, tradition, and three of my\nfather's nieces marrying three Emmet brothers, the first of these the\nRobert aforesaid. Catherine James, daughter of my uncle Augustus, his\nthen quite recent and, as I remember her, animated and attractive bride,\nwhose fair hair framed her pointed smile in full and far-drooping\n\"front\" curls, I easily evoke as my first apprehended image of the free\nand happy young woman of fashion, a sign of the wondrous fact that\nladies might live for pleasure, pleasure always, pleasure alone. She was\ndistinguished for nothing whatever so much as for an insatiable love of\nthe dance; that passion in which I think of the \"good,\" the best, New\nYork society of the time as having capered and champagned itself away.\nHer younger sister Gertrude, afterwards married to James--or more\ninveterately Jim--Pendleton, of Virginia, followed close upon her heels,\nliterally speaking, and though emulating her in other respects too, was\nto last, through many troubles, much longer (looking extraordinarily the\nwhile like the younger portraits of Queen Victoria) and to have much\nhospitality, showing it, and showing everything, in a singularly natural\nway, for a considerable collection of young hobbledehoy kinsmen. But I\nam solicited a moment longer by the queer little issues involved--as if\na social light would somehow stream from them--in my having been taken,\na mere mite of observation, to Kitty Emmet's \"grown-up\" assembly. Was it\nthat my mother really felt that to the scrap that I was other scraps\nwould perhaps strangely adhere, to the extent thus of something to\ndistinguish me by, nothing else probably having as yet declared\nitself--such a scrap for instance as the fine germ of this actual\nferment of memory and play of fancy, a retroactive vision almost intense\nof the faded hour and a fond surrender to the questions with which it\nbristles? All the female relatives on my father's side who reappear to\nme in these evocations strike me as having been intensely and admirably,\nbut at the same time almost indescribably, _natural_; which fact\nconnects itself for the brooding painter and fond analyst with fifty\nother matters and impressions, his vision of a whole social order--if\nthe American scene might indeed have been said at that time to be\npositively ordered. Wasn't the fact that the dancing passion was so out\nof proportion to any social resource just one of the signs of the\nnatural?--and for that matter in both sexes alike of the artless\nkindred. It was shining to us that Jim Pendleton had a yacht--though I\nwas not smuggled aboard it; there the line was drawn--but the deck must\nhave been more used for the \"German\" than for other manoeuvres, often\ndoubtless under the lead of our cousin Robert, the eldest of the many\nlight irresponsibles to whom my father was uncle: distinct to me still\nbeing the image of that phenomenally lean and nimble choreographic hero,\n\"Bob\" James to us always, who, almost ghost-fashion, led the cotillion\non from generation to generation, his skull-like smile, with its accent\nfrom the stiff points of his long moustache and the brightly hollow\norbits of his eyes, helping to make of him an immemorial elegant\nskeleton.\n\nIt is at all events to the sound of fiddles and the popping of corks\nthat I see even young brides, as well as young grooms, originally so\nformed to please and to prosper as our hosts of the restless little\noccasion I have glanced at, vanish untimely, become mysterious and\nlegendary, with such unfathomed silences and significant headshakes\nreplacing the earlier concert; so that I feel how one's impression of so\nmuch foredoomed youthful levity received constant and quite thrilling\nincrease. It was of course an impression then obscurely gathered, but\ninto which one was later on to read strange pages--to some of which I\nmay find myself moved to revert. Mere mite of observation though I have\ndubbed myself, I won't pretend to have deciphered any of them amid the\nbacchanal sounds that, on the evening so suggestively spent, floated out\ninto the region of Washington Place. It is round that general centre\nthat my richest memories of the \"gay\" little life in general cluster--as\nif it had been, for the circle in which I seem justified in pretending\nto have \"moved,\" of the finer essence of \"town\"; covering as it did the\nstretch of Broadway down to Canal Street, with, closer at hand, the New\nYork Hotel, which figured somehow inordinately in our family annals (the\ntwo newer ones, the glory of their brief and discredited, their flouted\nand demolished age, the brown Metropolitan and the white St. Nicholas,\nwere much further down) and rising northward to the Ultima Thule of\nTwenty-third Street, only second then in the supposedly ample scheme of\nthe regular ninth \"wide\" street. I can't indeed have moved much on that\nnight of revelations and yet of enigmas over which I still hang\nfascinated; I must have kept intensely still in my corner, all wondering\nand all fearing--fearing notice most; and in a definite way I but\nremember the formidable interest of my so convincing dowager (to hark\nback for a second to _her_) and the fact that a great smooth white cloth\nwas spread across the denuded room, converted thus into a field of\nfrolic the prospect of which much excited my curiosity. I but recover\nthe preparations, however, without recovering the performance; Mrs. L.\nand I must have been the only persons not shaking a foot, and premature\nunconsciousness clearly in my case supervened. Out of it peeps again the\nriddle, the so quaint _trait de moeurs_, of my infant participation.\nBut I set that down as representative and interesting, and have done\nwith it.\n\nThe manners of the time had obviously a _bonhomie_ of their\nown--certainly so on our particularly indulgent and humane little field;\nas to which general proposition the later applications and\ntransformations of the bonhomie would be interesting to trace. It has\nlingered and fermented and earned other names, but I seem on the track\nof its prime evidence with that note of the sovereign ease of all the\nyoung persons with whom we grew up. In the after-time, as our view took\nin, with new climes and new scenes, other examples of the class, these\nwere always to affect us as more formed and finished, more tutored and\ngovernessed, warned and armed at more points for, and doubtless often\nagainst, the social relation; so that this prepared state on their part,\nand which at first appeared but a preparation for shyness or silence or\nwhatever other ideal of the unconversable, came to be for us the normal,\nsince it was the relative and not the positive, still less the\nsuperlative, state. No charming creatures of the growing girl sort were\never to be natural in the degree of these nearer and remoter ornaments\nof our family circle in youth; when after intervals and absences the\nimpression was renewed we saw how right we had been about it, and I feel\nas if we had watched it for years under the apprehension and the vision\nof some inevitable change, wondering with an affectionate interest what\neffect the general improvement in manners might, perhaps all\nunfortunately, have upon it. I make out as I look back that it was\nreally to succumb at no point to this complication, that it was to keep\nits really quite inimitable freshness to the end, or, in other words,\nwhen it had been the first free growth of the old conditions, was to\npass away but with the passing of those themselves for whom it had been\nthe sole possible expression. For it was as of an altogether special\nshade and sort that the New York young naturalness of our prime was\ntouchingly to linger with us--so that to myself, at present, with only\nthe gentle ghosts of the so numerous exemplars of it before me, it\nbecomes the very stuff of the soft cerements in which their general mild\nmortality is laid away. We used to have in the after-time, amid fresh\nrecognitions and reminders, the kindest \"old New York\" identifications\nfor it. The special shade of its identity was thus that it was not\nconscious--really not conscious of anything in the world; or was\nconscious of so few possibilities at least, and these so immediate and\nso a matter of course, that it came almost to the same thing. That was\nthe testimony that the slight subjects in question strike me as having\nborne to their surrounding medium--the fact that their unconsciousness\ncould be so preserved. They played about in it so happily and serenely\nand sociably, as unembarrassed and loquacious as they were unadmonished\nand uninformed--only aware at the most that a good many people within\ntheir horizon were \"dissipated\"; as in point of fact, alas, a good many\n_were_. What it was to be dissipated--that, however, was but in the most\nlimited degree a feature of their vision; they would have held, under\npressure, that it consisted more than anything else in getting tipsy.\n\nInfinitely queer and quaint, almost incongruously droll, the sense\nsomehow begotten in ourselves, as very young persons, of our being\nsurrounded by a slightly remote, yet dimly rich, outer and quite kindred\ncircle of the tipsy. I remember how, once, as a very small boy, after\nmeeting in the hall a most amiable and irreproachable gentleman, all\nbut closely consanguineous, who had come to call on my mother, I\nanticipated his further entrance by slipping in to report to that parent\nthat I thought _he_ must be tipsy. And I was to recall perfectly\nafterwards the impression I so made on her--in which the general\nproposition that the gentlemen of a certain group or connection might on\noccasion be best described by the term I had used sought to destroy the\nparticular presumption that our visitor wouldn't, by his ordinary\nmeasure, show himself for one of those. He didn't, to all appearance,\nfor I was afterwards disappointed at the lapse of lurid evidence: that\nmemory remained with me, as well as a considerable subsequent wonder at\nmy having leaped to so baseless a view. The truth was indeed that we had\ntoo, in the most innocent way in the world, our sense of \"dissipation\"\nas an abounding element in family histories; a sense fed quite directly\nby our fondness for making our father--I can at any rate testify for the\nurgency of my own appeal to him--tell us stories of the world of his\nyouth. He regaled us with no scandals, yet it somehow rarely failed to\ncome out that each contemporary on his younger scene, each hero of each\nthrilling adventure, had, in spite of brilliant promise and romantic\ncharm, ended badly, as badly as possible. This became our gaping\ngeneralisation--it gaped even under the moral that the anecdote was\nalways, and so familiarly, humanly and vividly, designed to convey:\neveryone in the little old Albany of the Dutch houses and the steep\nstreets and the recurrent family names--Townsends, Clintons, Van\nRensselaers, Pruyns: I pick them up again at hazard, and all\nuninvidiously, out of reverberations long since still--everyone without\nexception had at last taken a turn as far as possible from edifying. And\nwhat they had most in common, the hovering presences, the fitful\napparitions that, speaking for myself, so engaged my imagination, was\njust the fine old Albany drama--in the light of which a ring of mystery\nas to their lives (mainly carried on at the New York Hotel aforesaid)\nsurrounded them, and their charm, inveterate, as I believed, shone out\nas through vaguely-apprehended storm-clouds. Their charm was in various\nmarks of which I shall have more to say--for as I breathe all this\nhushed air again even the more broken things give out touching human\nvalues and faint sweet scents of character, flushes of old beauty and\ngood-will.\n\nThe grim little generalisation remained, none the less, and I may speak\nof it--since I speak of everything--as still standing: the striking\nevidence that scarce aught but disaster _could_, in that so unformed and\nunseasoned society, overtake young men who were in the least exposed.\nNot to have been immediately launched in business of a rigorous sort\nwas to _be_ exposed--in the absence I mean of some fairly abnormal\npredisposition to virtue; since it was a world so simply constituted\nthat whatever wasn't business, or exactly an office or a \"store,\" places\nin which people sat close and made money, was just simply pleasure,\nsought, and sought only, in places in which people got tipsy. There was\nclearly no mean, least of all the golden one, for it was just the ready,\neven when the moderate, possession of gold that determined, that hurried\non, disaster. There were whole sets and groups, there were\n\"sympathetic,\" though too susceptible, races, that seemed scarce to\nrecognise or to find possible any practical application of moneyed, that\nis of transmitted, ease, however limited, but to go more or less rapidly\nto the bad with it--which meant even then going as often as possible to\nParis. The bright and empty air was as void of \"careers\" for a choice as\nof cathedral towers for a sketcher, and I passed my younger time, till\nwithin a year or two of the Civil War, with an absolute vagueness of\nimpression as to how the political life of the country was carried on.\nThe field was strictly covered, to my young eyes, I make out, by three\nclasses, the busy, the tipsy, and Daniel Webster. This last great man\nmust have represented for us a class in himself; as if to be \"political\"\nwas just to _be_ Daniel Webster in his proper person and with room left\nover for nobody else. That he should have filled the sky of public life\nfrom pole to pole, even to a childish consciousness not formed in New\nEngland and for which that strenuous section was but a name in the\ngeography-book, is probably indeed a sign of how large, in the general\nair, he comparatively loomed. The public scene was otherwise a blank to\nour young vision, I discern, till, later on, in Paris, I saw--for at\nthat unimproved period we of the unfledged didn't suppose ourselves to\n\"meet\"--Charles Sumner; with whose name indeed there further connects\nitself the image of a thrilled hour in the same city some months before:\nthe gathering of a group of indignant persons on the terrace of a small\nold-world _h\u00c3\u00b4tel_ or pavilion looking out on the Avenue des Champs\nElys\u00c3\u00a9es, slightly above the Rond-Point and just opposite the\nantediluvian Jardin d'Hiver (who remembers the Jardin d'Hiver, who\nremembers the ancient lodges of the _octroi_, the pair of them facing\neach other at the Barri\u00c3\u00a8re de l'\u00c3\u0089toile?) and among them a passionate\nlady in tears over the news, fresh that morning, of the assault on\nSumner by the South Carolina ruffian of the House. The wounded Senator,\ninjured in health, had come to Europe later on to recuperate, and he\noffered me my first view, to the best of my belief, not only of a\n\"statesman,\" but of any person whomsoever concerned in political life. I\ndistinguish in the earlier twilight of Fourteenth Street my father's\nreturn to us one November day--we knew he had been out to vote--with the\nnews that General Winfield Scott, his and the then \"Whig\" candidate, had\nbeen defeated for the Presidency; just as I rescue from the same limbo\nmy afterwards proud little impression of having \"met\" that high-piled\nhero of the Mexican War, whom the Civil War was so soon and with so\nlittle ceremony to extinguish, literally met him, at my father's side,\nin Fifth Avenue, where he had just emerged from a cross-street. I remain\nvague as to what had then happened and scarce suppose I was, at the age\nprobably of eight or nine, \"presented\"; but we must have been for some\nmoments face to face while from under the vast amplitude of a dark blue\nmilitary cloak with a big velvet collar and loosened silver clasp, which\nspread about him like a symbol of the tented field, he greeted my\nparent--so clear is my sense of the time it took me to gape _all_ the\nway up to where he towered aloft.\n\n\n\n\nV\n\n\nThe not very glorious smoke of the Mexican War, I note for another\ntouch, had been in the air when I was a still smaller boy, and I have an\nassociation with it that hovers between the definite and the dim, a\nvision of our uncle (Captain as he then was) Robert Temple, U.S.A., in\nregimentals, either on his way to the scene of action or on the return\nfrom it. I see him as a person half asleep sees some large object across\nthe room and against the window-light--even if to the effect of my now\nasking myself why, so far from the scene of action, he was in panoply of\nwar. I seem to see him cock-hatted and feathered too--an odd vision of\ndancing superior plumes which doesn't fit if he was only a captain.\nHowever, I cultivate the wavering shade merely for its value as my\nearliest glimpse of any circumstance of the public order--unless indeed\nanother, the reminiscence to which I owe to-day my sharpest sense of\npersonal antiquity, had already given me the historic thrill. The scene\nof this latter stir of consciousness is, for memory, an apartment in one\nof the three Fifth Avenue houses that were not long afterward swallowed\nup in the present Brevoort Hotel, and consists of the admired\nappearance of my uncles \"Gus\" and John James to announce to my father\nthat the Revolution had triumphed in Paris and Louis Philippe had fled\nto England. These last words, the flight of the king, linger on my ear\nat this hour even as they fell there; we had somehow waked early to a\nperception of Paris, and a vibration of my very most infantine\nsensibility under its sky had by the same stroke got itself preserved\nfor subsequent wondering reference. I had been there for a short time in\nthe second year of my life, and I was to communicate to my parents later\non that as a baby in long clothes, seated opposite to them in a carriage\nand on the lap of another person, I had been impressed with the view,\nframed by the clear window of the vehicle as we passed, of a great\nstately square surrounded with high-roofed houses and having in its\ncentre a tall and glorious column. I had naturally caused them to\nmarvel, but I had also, under cross-questioning, forced them to compare\nnotes, as it were, and reconstitute the miracle. They knew what my\nobservation of monumental squares had been--and alas hadn't; neither New\nYork nor Albany could have offered me the splendid perspective, and, for\nthat matter, neither could London, which moreover I had known at a\nyounger age still. Conveyed along the Rue St.-Honor\u00c3\u00a9 while I waggled my\nsmall feet, as I definitely remember doing, under my flowing robe, I had\ncrossed the Rue de Castiglione and taken in, for all my time, the\nadmirable aspect of the Place and the Colonne Vend\u00c3\u00b4me. I don't now\npretend to measure the extent to which my interest in the events of\n1848--I was five years old--was quickened by that _souvenir_, a\ntradition further reinforced, I should add, by the fact that some\nrelative or other, some member of our circle, was always either \"there\"\n(\"there\" being of course generally Europe, but particularly and\npointedly Paris) or going there or coming back from there: I at any rate\nrevert to the sound of the rich words on my uncles' lips as to my\npositive initiation into History. It was as if I had been ready for them\nand could catch on; I had heard of kings presumably, and also of\nfleeing: but that kings had sometimes to flee was a new and striking\nimage, to which the apparent consternation of my elders added dramatic\nforce. So much, in any case, for what I may claim--perhaps too idly--on\nbehalf of my backward reach.\n\nIt has carried me far from my rather evident proposition that if we saw\nthe \"natural\" so happily embodied about us--and in female maturity, or\ncomparative maturity, scarce less than in female adolescence--this was\nbecause the artificial, or in other words the complicated, was so\nlittle there to threaten it. The complicated, as we were later on to\ndefine it, was but another name for those more massed and violent\nassaults upon the social sense that we were to recognise subsequently by\ntheir effects--observing thus that a sense more subtly social had so\nbeen created, and that it quite differed from that often almost complete\ninward blankness, in respect to any circumjacent, any constituted, order\nto the exhibition of which our earlier air and our family scene had\ninimitably treated us. We came more or less to see that our young\ncontemporaries of another world, the trained and admonished, the\ndisciplined and governessed, or in a word the formed, relatively\nspeaking, had been made aware of many things of which those at home\nhadn't been; yet we were also to note--so far as we may be conceived as\nso precociously \"noting,\" though we were certainly incorrigible\nobservers--that, the awareness in question remaining at the best\nimperfect, our little friends as distinguished from our companions of\nthe cousinship, greater and less, advanced and presumed but to flounder\nand recede, elated at once and abashed and on the whole but _feebly_\nsophisticated. The cousinship, on the other hand, all unalarmed and\nunsuspecting and unembarrassed, lived by pure serenity, sociability and\nloquacity; the oddest fact about its members being withal that it didn't\nmake them bores, I seem to feel as I look back, or at least not worse\nbores than sundry specimens of the other growth. There can surely never\nhave been anything like their good faith and, generally speaking, their\namiability. I should have but to let myself go a little to wish to cite\nexamples--save that in doing so I should lose sight of my point; which\nis to recall again that whether we were all amiable or not (and,\nfrankly, I claim it in a high degree for most of us) the scene on which\nwe so freely bloomed does strike me, when I reckon up, as\nextraordinarily unfurnished. How came it then that for the most part so\nsimple we yet weren't more inane? This was doubtless by reason of the\nquantity of our inward life--ours of our father's house in especial I\nmean--which made an excellent, in some cases almost an incomparable,\n_fond_ for a thicker civility to mix with when growing experience should\nbegin to take that in. It was also quaint, among us, I may be reminded,\nto have _begun_ with the inward life; but we began, after the manner of\nall men, as we could, and I hold that if it comes to that we might have\nbegun much worse.\n\nI was in my seventeenth year when the raid and the capture of John\nBrown, of Harper's Ferry fame, enjoyed its sharp reverberation among us,\nthough we were then on the other side of the world; and I count this as\nthe very first reminder that reached me of our living, on our side, in\na political order: I had perfectly taken in from the pages of \"Punch,\"\nwhich contributed in the highest degree to our education, that the\npeoples on the other side so lived. As there was no American \"Punch,\"\nand to this time has been none, to give small boys the sense and the\nimagination of living with their public administrators, Daniel Webster\nand Charles Sumner had never become, for my fancy, members of a class, a\nclass which numbered in England, by John Leech's showing, so many other\nmembers still than Lords Brougham, Palmerston and John Russell. The war\nof Secession, soon arriving, was to cause the field to bristle with\nfeatures and the sense of the State, in our generation, infinitely to\nquicken; but that alarm came upon the country like a thief at night, and\nwe might all have been living in a land in which there seemed at least\nnothing save a comparatively small amount of quite private property to\nsteal. Even private property in other than the most modest amounts\nscarce figured for our particular selves; which doubtless came partly\nfrom the fact that amid all the Albany issue there was ease, with the\nhabit of ease, thanks to our grandfather's fine old ability--he had\ndecently provided for so large a generation; but our consciousness was\npositively disfurnished, as that of young Americans went, of the\nactualities of \"business\" in a world of business. As to that we all\nformed together quite a monstrous exception; business in a world of\nbusiness was the thing we most agreed (differ as we might on minor\nissues) in knowing nothing about. We touched it and it touched us\nneither directly nor otherwise, and I think our fond detachment, not to\nsay our helpless ignorance and on occasion (since I can speak for one\nfine instance) our settled density of understanding, made us an\nunexampled and probably, for the ironic \"smart\" gods of the American\nheaven, a lamentable case. Of course even the office and the \"store\"\nleave much of the provision for an approximately complete scheme of\nmanners to be accounted for; still there must have been vast numbers of\npeople about us for whom, under the usages, the assault on the\nimagination from without was much stronger and the filling-in of the\ngeneral picture much richer. It was exactly by the lack of that\nfilling-in that we--we more especially who lived at near view of my\nfather's admirable example--had been thrown so upon the inward life. No\none could ever have taken to it, even in the face of discouragement,\nmore kindly and naturally than he; but the situation had at least that\ncharm that, in default of so many kinds of the outward, people had their\nchoice of as many kinds of the inward as they would, and might practise\nthose kinds with whatever consistency, intensity and brilliancy. Of our\nfather's perfect gift for practising _his_ kind I shall have more to\nsay; but I meanwhile glance yet again at those felicities of destitution\nwhich kept us, collectively, so genially interested in almost nothing\nbut each other and which come over me now as one of the famous blessings\nin disguise.\n\nThere were \"artists\" in the prospect--didn't Mr. Tom Hicks and Mr. Paul\nDuggan and Mr. C. P. Cranch and Mr. Felix Darley, this last worthy of a\nwider reputation, capable perhaps even of a finer development, than he\nattained, more or less haunt our friendly fireside, and give us also the\nsense of others, landscapist Cropseys and Coles and Kensetts, and\nbust-producing Iveses and Powerses and Moziers, hovering in an outer\ncircle? There were authors not less, some of them vague and female and\nin this case, as a rule, glossily ringletted and monumentally\nbreastpinned, but mostly frequent and familiar, after the manner of\nGeorge Curtis and Parke Godwin and George Ripley and Charles Dana and N.\nP. Willis and, for brighter lights or those that in our then comparative\nobscurity almost deceived the morn, Mr. Bryant, Washington Irving and E.\nA. Poe--the last-named of whom I cite not so much because he was\npersonally present (the extremity of personal absence had just overtaken\nhim) as by reason of that predominant lustre in him which our small\nopening minds themselves already recognised and which makes me wonder\nto-day at the legend of the native neglect of him. Was he not even at\nthat time on all lips, had not my brother, promptly master of the\nsubject, beckoned on my lagging mind with a recital of The Gold-Bug and\nThe Pit and the Pendulum?--both of which, however, I was soon enough to\nread for myself, adding to them The Murders in the Rue Morgue. Were we\nnot also forever mounting on little platforms at our infant schools to\n\"speak\" The Raven and Lenore and the verses in which we phrased the\nheroine as Annabellee?--falling thus into the trap the poet had so\nrecklessly laid for us, as he had laid one for our interminable droning,\nnot less, in the other pieces I have named. So far from misprizing our\nill-starred magician we acclaimed him surely at every turn; he lay upon\nour tables and resounded in our mouths, while we communed to satiety,\neven for boyish appetites, over the thrill of his choicest pages. Don't\nI just recognise the ghost of a dim memory of a children's Christmas\nparty at the house of Fourteenth Street neighbours--they come back to me\nas \"the Beans\": who and what and whence and whither the kindly\nBeans?--where I admired over the chimney piece the full-length portrait\nof a lady seated on the ground in a Turkish dress, with hair flowing\nloose from a cap which was not as the caps of ladies known to me, and I\nthink with a tambourine, who was somehow identified to my enquiring\nmind as the wife of the painter of the piece, Mr. Osgood, and the so\nministering friend of the unhappy Mr. Poe. There she throned in honour,\nlike Queen Constance on the \"huge firm earth\"--all for _that_ and her\ntambourine; and surely we could none of us have done more for the\nconnection.\n\nWashington Irving I \"met,\" with infant promptitude, very much as I had\nmet General Scott; only this time it was on a steamboat that I\napprehended the great man; my father, under whose ever-patient\nprotection I then was--during the summer afternoon's sail from New York\nto Fort Hamilton--having named him to me, for this long preservation,\nbefore they greeted and talked, and having a fact of still more moment\nto mention, with the greatest concern, afterwards: Mr. Irving had given\nhim the news of the shipwreck of Margaret Fuller in those very waters\n(Fire Island at least was but just without our big Bay) during the great\nAugust storm that had within the day or two passed over us. The\nunfortunate lady was essentially of the Boston connection; but she must\nhave been, and probably through Emerson, a friend of my parents--mustn't\nshe have held \"conversations,\" in the finest exotic Bostonese, in New\nYork, Emerson himself lecturing there to admiration?--since the more I\nsqueeze the sponge of memory the more its stored secretions flow, to\nremind me here again that, being with those elders late one evening at\nan exhibition of pictures, possibly that of the National Academy, then\nconfined to scant quarters, I was shown a small full-length portrait of\nMiss Fuller, seated as now appears to me and wrapped in a long white\nshawl, the failure of which to do justice to its original my companions\ndenounced with some emphasis. Was this work from the hand of Mr. Tom\nHicks aforesaid, or was that artist concerned only with the life-sized,\nthe enormous (as I took it to be) the full-length, the violently\nprotruded accessories in which come back to me with my infant sense of\nthe wonder and the beauty of them, as expressed above all in the image\nof a very long and lovely lady, the new bride of the artist, standing at\na window before a row of plants or bulbs in tall coloured glasses. The\nlight of the window playing over the figure and the \"treatment\" of its\nglass and of the flower-pots and the other furniture, passed, by my\nimpression, for the sign of the master hand; and _was_ it all brave and\ncharming, or was it only very hard and stiff, quite ugly and helpless? I\nput these questions as to a vanished world and by way of pressing back\ninto it only the more clingingly and tenderly--wholly regardless in\nother words of whether the answers to them at all matter. They matter\ndoubtless but for fond evocation, and if one tries to evoke one must\nneglect none of the arts, one must do it with all the forms. Why I\n_should_ so like to do it is another matter--and what \"outside\ninterest\" I may suppose myself to create perhaps still another: I\nfatuously proceed at any rate, I make so far as I can the small warm\ndusky homogeneous New York world of the mid-century close about us.\n\n\n\n\nVI\n\n\nI see a small and compact and ingenuous society, screened in somehow\nconveniently from north and west, but open wide to the east and\ncomparatively to the south and, though perpetually moving up Broadway,\nnone the less constantly and delightfully walking down it. Broadway was\nthe feature and the artery, the joy and the adventure of one's\nchildhood, and it stretched, and prodigiously, from Union Square to\nBarnum's great American Museum by the City Hall--or only went further on\nthe Saturday mornings (absurdly and deplorably frequent alas) when we\nwere swept off by a loving aunt, our mother's only sister, then much\ndomesticated with us and to whom the ruthless care had assigned itself\nfrom the first, to Wall Street and the torture chamber of Dr. Parkhurst,\nour tremendously respectable dentist, who was so old and so empurpled\nand so polite, in his stock and dress-coat and dark and glossy wig, that\nhe had been our mother's and our aunt's haunting fear in _their_ youth\nas well, since, in their quiet Warren Street, not far off, they were,\ndreadful to think, comparatively under his thumb. He extremely\nresembles, to my mind's eye, certain figures in Phiz's illustrations to\nDickens, and it was clear to us through our long ordeal that our elders\nmust, by some mistaken law of compensation, some refinement of the\nvindictive, be making us \"pay\" for what they in like helplessness had\nsuffered from him: as if _we_ had done them any harm! Our analysis was\nmuddled, yet in a manner relieving, and for us too there were\ncompensations, which we grudged indeed to allow, but which I could\neasily, even if shyly, have named. One of these was Godey's Lady's Book,\na sallow pile of which (it shows to me for sallow in the warmer and less\nstony light of the Wall Street of those days and through the smell of\nancient anodynes) lay on Joey Bagstock's table for our beguilement while\nwe waited: I was to encounter in Phiz's Dombey and Son that design for\nour tormentor's type. There is no doubt whatever that I succumbed to the\nspell of Godey, who, unlike the present essences, was an anodyne before\nthe fact as well as after; since I remember poring, in his pages, over\ntales of fashionable life in Philadelphia while awaiting my turn in the\nchair, not less than doing so when my turn was over and to the music of\nmy brother's groans. This must have been at the hours when we were left\ndiscreetly to our own fortitude, through our aunt's availing herself of\nthe relative proximity to go and shop at Stewart's and then come back\nfor us; the ladies' great shop, vast, marmorean, plate-glassy and\nnotoriously fatal to the female nerve (we ourselves had wearily trailed\nthrough it, hanging on the skirts, very literally, of indecision) which\nbravely waylaid custom on the Broadway corner of Chambers Street. Wasn't\npart of the charm of life--since I assume that there _was_ such a\ncharm--in its being then (I allude to life itself) so much more\ndown-towny, on the supposition at least that our young gravitation in\nthat sense for most of the larger joys consorted with something of the\ngeneral habit? The joy that had to be fished out, like Truth, from the\nvery bottom of the well was attendance at Trinity Church, still in that\nage supereminent, pointedly absolute, the finest feature of the\nsouthward scene; to the privilege of which the elder Albany cousins were\napt to be treated when they came on to stay with us; an indulgence\nmaking their enjoyment of our city as down-towny as possible too, for I\nseem otherwise to see them but as returning with the familiar Stewart\nheadache from the prolonged strain of selection.\n\nThe great reward dispensed to us for our sessions in the house of\npain--as to which it became our subsequent theory that we had been\nregularly dragged there on alternate Saturdays--was our being carried on\nthe return to the house of delight, or to one of them, for there were\nspecifically two, where we partook of ice-cream, deemed sovereign for\nsore mouths, deemed sovereign in fact, all through our infancy, for\neverything. Two great establishments for the service of it graced the\nprospect, one Thompson's and the other Taylor's, the former, I perfectly\nrecall, grave and immemorial, the latter upstart but dazzling, and\nhaving together the effect that whichever we went to we wondered if we\nhadn't better have gone to the other--with that capacity of childhood\nfor making the most of its adventures after a fashion that may look so\nlike making the least. It is in our father's company indeed that, as I\npress the responsive spring, I see the bedizened saucers heaped up for\nour fond consumption (they bore the Taylor-title painted in blue and\ngilded, with the Christian name, as parentally pointed out to us,\nperverted to \"Jhon\" for John, whereas the Thompson-name scorned such\nvulgar and above all such misspelt appeals;) whence I infer that still\nother occasions for that experience waited on us--as almost any would\nserve, and a paternal presence so associated with them was not in the\nleast conceivable in the Wall Street _repaire_. That presence is in fact\nnot associated for me, to any effect of distinctness, with the least of\nour suffered shocks or penalties--though partly doubtless because our\nacquaintance with such was of the most limited; a conclusion I form even\nwhile judging it to have been on the whole sufficient for our virtue.\nThis sounds perhaps as if we had borne ourselves as prodigies or\nprigs--which was as far as possible from being the case; we were bred in\nhorror of _conscious_ propriety, of what my father was fond of calling\n\"flagrant\" morality; what I myself at any rate read back into our rare\neducational ease, for the memory of some sides of which I was ever to be\nthankful, is, besides the _general_ humanisation of our apprehended\nworld and our \"social\" tone, the unmistakeable appearance that my father\nwas again and again accompanied in public by his small second son: so\nmany young impressions come back to me as gathered at his side and in\nhis personal haunts. Not that he mustn't have offered his firstborn at\nleast equal opportunities; but I make out that he seldom led us forth,\nsuch as we were, together, and my brother must have had in _his_ turn\nmany a mild adventure of which the secret--I like to put it so--perished\nwith him. He was to remember, as I perceived later on, many things that\nI didn't, impressions I sometimes wished, as with a retracing jealousy,\nor at least envy, that I might also have fallen direct heir to; but he\nprofessed amazement, and even occasionally impatience, at my reach of\nreminiscence--liking as he did to brush away old moral scraps in favour\nof new rather than to hoard and so complacently exhibit them. If in my\nway I collected the new as well I yet cherished the old; the ragbag of\nmemory hung on its nail in my closet, though I learnt with time to\ncontrol the habit of bringing it forth. And I say that with a due sense\nof my doubtless now appearing to empty it into these pages.\n\nI keep picking out at hazard those passages of our earliest age that\nhelp to reconstruct for me even by tiny touches the experience of our\nparents, any shade of which seems somehow to signify. I cherish, to the\nextent of here reproducing, an old daguerreotype all the circumstances\nof the taking of which I intensely recall--though as I was lately turned\ntwelve when I figured for it the feat of memory is perhaps not\nremarkable. It documents for me in so welcome and so definite a manner\nmy father's cultivation of my company. It documents at the same time the\nabsurdest little legend of my small boyhood--the romantic tradition of\nthe value of being taken up from wherever we were staying to the queer\nempty dusty smelly New York of midsummer: I apply that last term because\nwe always arrived by boat and I have still in my nostril the sense of\nthe _abords_ of the hot town, the rank and rubbishy waterside quarters,\nwhere big loose cobbles, for the least of all the base items, lay\nwrenched from their sockets of pungent black mud and where the dependent\nstreets managed by a law of their own to be all corners and the corners\nto be all groceries; groceries indeed largely of the \"green\" order, so\nfar as greenness could persist in the torrid air, and that bristled, in\nglorious defiance of traffic, with the overflow of their wares and\nimplements. Carts and barrows and boxes and baskets, sprawling or\nstacked, familiarly elbowed in its course the bumping hack (the\ncomprehensive \"carriage\" of other days, the only vehicle of hire then\nknown to us) while the situation was accepted by the loose citizen in\nthe garb of a freeman save for the brass star on his breast--and the New\nYork garb of the period was, as I remember it, an immense attestation of\nliberty. Why the throb of romance should have beat time for me to such\nvisions I can scarce explain, or can explain only by the fact that the\nsqualor was a squalor wonderfully mixed and seasoned, and that I should\nwrong the whole impression if I didn't figure it first and foremost as\nthat of some vast succulent cornucopia. What did the stacked boxes and\nbaskets of our youth represent but the boundless fruitage of that more\nbucolic age of the American world, and what was after all of so strong\nan assault as the rankness of such a harvest? Where is that fruitage\nnow, where in particular are the peaches _d'antan_? where the mounds of\nIsabella grapes and Seckel pears in the sticky sweetness of which our\nchildhood seems to have been steeped? It was surely, save perhaps for\noranges, a more informally and familiarly fruit-eating time, and bushels\nof peaches in particular, peaches big and peaches small, peaches white\nand peaches yellow, played a part in life from which they have somehow\nbeen deposed; every garden, almost every bush and the very boys' pockets\ngrew them; they were \"cut up\" and eaten with cream at every meal;\ndomestically \"brandied\" they figured, the rest of the year, scarce less\nfreely--if they were rather a \"party dish\" it was because they made the\nparty whenever they appeared, and when ice-cream was added, or they were\nadded _to_ it, they formed the highest revel we knew. Above all the\npublic heaps of them, the high-piled receptacles at every turn, touched\nthe street as with a sort of southern plenty; the note of the rejected\nand scattered fragments, the memory of the slippery skins and rinds and\nkernels with which the old dislocated flags were bestrown, is itself\nendeared to me and contributes a further pictorial grace. We ate\neverything in those days by the bushel and the barrel, as from stores\nthat were infinite; we handled watermelons as freely as cocoanuts, and\nthe amount of stomach-ache involved was negligible in the general\nEden-like consciousness.\n\nThe glow of this consciousness even in so small an organism was part of\nthe charm of these retreats offered me cityward upon our base of\nprovisions; a part of the rest of which, I disengage, was in my fond\nperception of that almost eccentrically home-loving habit in my father\nwhich furnished us with half the household humour of our\nchildhood--besides furnishing _him_ with any quantity of extravagant\npicture of his so prompt pangs of anguish in absence for celebration of\nhis precipitate returns. It was traditional for us later on, and\nespecially on the European scene, that for him to leave us in pursuit of\nsome advantage or convenience, some improvement of our condition, some\nenlargement of our view, was for him breathlessly to reappear, after the\nshortest possible interval, with no account at all to give of the\nbenefit aimed at, but instead of this a moving representation, a far\nricher recital, of his spiritual adventures at the horrid inhuman inns\nand amid the hard alien races which had stayed his advance. He reacted,\nhe rebounded, in favour of his fireside, from whatever brief\nexplorations or curiosities; these passionate spontaneities were the\npulse of his life and quite some of the principal events of ours; and,\nas he was nothing if not expressive, whatever happened to him for inward\nintensity happened abundantly to us for pity and terror, as it were, as\nwell as for an ease and a quality of amusement among ourselves that was\nreally always to fail us among others. Comparatively late in life, after\nhis death, I had occasion to visit, in lieu of my brother, then in\nEurope, an American city in which he had had, since his own father's\ndeath, interests that were of importance to us all. On my asking the\nagent in charge when the owner had last taken personal cognisance of his\nproperty that gentleman replied only half to my surprise that he had\nnever in all his years of possession performed such an act. Then it was\nperhaps that I most took the measure of his fine faith in human\nconfidence as an administrative function. He had to have a _relation_,\nsomehow expressed--and as he was the vividest and happiest of\nletter-writers it rarely failed of coming; but once it was established\nit served him, in every case, much better than fussy challenges, which\nhad always the drawback of involving lapses and inattentions in regard\nto solicitudes more pressing. He incurably took for granted--incurably\nbecause whenever he did so the process succeeded; with which\nassociation, however, I perhaps overdrench my complacent vision of our\nsummer snatches at town. Through a grave accident in early life country\nwalks on rough roads were, in spite of his great constitutional\nsoundness, tedious and charmless to him; he liked on the other hand the\npeopled pavement, the thought of which made him restless when away.\nHence the fidelities and sociabilities, however superficial, that he\ncouldn't _not_ reaffirm--if he could only reaffirm the others, the\nreally intimate and still more communicable, soon enough afterwards.\n\nIt was these of the improvised and casual sort that I shared with him\nthus indelibly; for truly if we took the boat to town to do things I did\nthem quite as much as he, and so that a little boy could scarce have\ndone them more. My part may indeed but have been to surround his part\nwith a thick imaginative aura; but that constituted for me an activity\nthan which I could dream of none braver or wilder. We went to the office\nof The New York Tribune--my father's relations with that journal were\nactual and close; and that was a wonderful world indeed, with strange\nsteepnesses and machineries and noises and hurrying bare-armed,\nbright-eyed men, and amid the agitation clever, easy, kindly, jocular,\npartly undressed gentlemen (it was always July or August) some of whom I\nknew at home, taking it all as if it were the most natural place in the\nworld. It was big to me, big to me with the breath of great vague\nconnections, and I supposed the gentlemen very old, though since aware\nthat they must have been, for the connections, remarkably young; and the\nconversation of one of them, the one I saw oftenest up town, who\nattained to great local and to considerable national eminence\nafterwards, and who talked often and thrillingly about the theatres, I\nretain as many bright fragments of as if I had been another little\nBoswell. It was as if he had dropped into my mind the germ of certain\ninterests that were long afterwards to flower--as for instance on his\nannouncing the receipt from Paris of news of the appearance at the\nTh\u00c3\u00a9\u00c3\u00a2tre Fran\u00c3\u00a7ais of an actress, Madame Judith, who was formidably to\ncompete with her coreligionary Rachel and to endanger that artist's\nlaurels. Why should Madame Judith's name have stuck to me through all\nthe years, since I was never to see her and she is as forgotten as\nRachel is remembered? Why should that scrap of gossip have made a date\nfor my consciousness, turning it to the Com\u00c3\u00a9die with an intensity that\nwas long afterwards to culminate? Why was it equally to abide for me\nthat the same gentleman had on one of these occasions mentioned his\nhaving just come back from a wonderful city of the West, Chicago, which,\nthough but a year or two old, with plank sidewalks when there were any,\nand holes and humps where there were none, and shanties where there were\nnot big blocks, and everything where there had yesterday been nothing,\nhad already developed a huge energy and curiosity, and also an appetite\nfor lectures? I became aware of the Com\u00c3\u00a9die, I became aware of Chicago;\nI also became aware that even the most alluring fiction was not always\nfor little boys to read. It was mentioned at the Tribune office that one\nof its reporters, Mr. Solon Robinson, had put forth a novel rather oddly\nentitled \"Hot Corn\" and more or less having for its subject the career\nof a little girl who hawked that familiar American luxury in the\nstreets. The volume, I think, was put into my father's hand, and I\nrecall my prompt desire to make acquaintance with it no less than the\nremark, as promptly addressed to my companion, that the work, however\nengaging, was not one that should be left accessible to an innocent\nchild. The pang occasioned by this warning has scarcely yet died out for\nme, nor my sense of my first wonder at the discrimination--so great\nbecame from that moment the mystery of the tabooed book, of whatever\nidentity; the question, in my breast, of why, if it was to be so right\nfor others, it was only to be wrong for me. I remember the soreness of\nthe thought that it was I rather who was wrong for the book--which was\nsomehow humiliating: in that amount of discredit one couldn't but be\ninvolved. Neither then nor afterwards was the secret of \"Hot Corn\"\nrevealed to me, and the sense of privation was to be more prolonged, I\nfear, than the vogue of the tale, which even as a success of scandal\ncouldn't have been great.\n\n\n\n\nVII\n\n\nDimly queer and \"pathetic\" to me were to remain through much of the\nafter time indeed most of those early indigenous vogues and literary\nflurries: so few of those that brushed by my childhood had been other\nthan a tinkling that suddenly stopped. I am afraid I mean that what was\ntouching was rather the fact that the tinkle _could_ penetrate than the\nfact that it died away; the light of criticism might have beat so\nstraight--if the sense of proportion and the fact of compassion hadn't\nwaved it away--on the \u00c3\u00a6sthetic phase during which the appeal was mainly\n_by_ the tinkle. The Scarlet Letter and The Seven Gables had the deep\ntone as much as one would; but of the current efforts of the imagination\nthey were alone in having it till Walt Whitman broke out in the later\nfifties--and I was to know nothing of that happy genius till long after.\nAn absorbed perusal of The Lamplighter was what I was to achieve at the\nfleeting hour I continue to circle round; that romance was on every\none's lips, and I recollect it as more or less thrust upon me in amends\nfor the imposed sacrifice of a ranker actuality--that of the improper\nMr. Robinson, I mean, as to whom there revives in me the main question\nof where his impropriety, in so general a platitude of the bourgeois,\ncould possibly have dwelt. It was to be true indeed that Walt Whitman\nachieved an impropriety of the first magnitude; that success, however,\nbut showed us the platitude returning in a genial rage upon itself and\ngetting out of control by generic excess. There was no rage at any rate\nin The Lamplighter, over which I fondly hung and which would have been\nmy first \"grown-up\" novel--it had been soothingly offered me for\nthat--had I consented to take it as really and truly grown-up. I\ncouldn't have said what it lacked for the character, I only had my\nsecret reserves, and when one blest afternoon on the New Brighton boat I\nwaded into The Initials I saw how right I had been. The Initials _was_\ngrown-up and the difference thereby exquisite; it came over me with the\nvery first page, assimilated in the fluttered little cabin to which I\nhad retired with it--all in spite of the fact too that my attention was\ndistracted by a pair of remarkable little girls who lurked there out of\nmore public view as to hint that they weren't to be seen for nothing.\n\nThat must have been a rich hour, for I mix the marvel of the Boon\nChildren, strange pale little flowers of the American theatre, with my\nconscious joy in bringing back to my mother, from our forage in New\nYork, a gift of such happy promise as the history of the long-legged Mr.\nHamilton and his two Bavarian beauties, the elder of whom, Hildegarde,\nwas to figure for our small generation as the very type of the haughty\nas distinguished from the forward heroine (since I think our categories\nreally came to no more than those). I couldn't have got very far with\nHildegarde in moments so scant, but I memorably felt that romance was\nthick round me--everything, at such a crisis, seeming to make for it at\nonce. The Boon Children, conveyed thus to New Brighton under care of a\nlady in whose aspect the strain of the resolute triumphed over the note\nof the battered, though the showy in it rather succumbed at the same\ntime to the dowdy, were already \"billed,\" as infant phenomena, for a\nperformance that night at the Pavilion, where our attendance, it was a\nshock to feel, couldn't be promised; and in gazing without charge at the\npair of weary and sleepy little mountebanks I found the histrionic\ncharacter and the dramatic profession for the first time revealed to me.\nThey filled me with fascination and yet with fear; they expressed a\nmelancholy grace and a sort of peevish refinement, yet seemed awfully\ndetached and indifferent, indifferent perhaps even to being pinched and\nslapped, for art's sake, at home; they honoured me with no notice\nwhatever and regarded me doubtless as no better than one of the little\nlouts peeping through the tent of the show. In return I judged their\nappearance dissipated though fascinating, and sought consolation for the\nmemory of their scorn and the loss of their exhibition, as time went on,\nin noting that the bounds of their fame seemed somehow to have been\nstayed. I neither \"met\" them nor heard of them again. The little\nBatemans must have obscured their comparatively dim lustre, flourishing\nat the same period and with a larger command of the pictorial poster and\nthe other primitive symbols in Broadway--such posters and such symbols\nas they were at that time!--the little Batemans who were to be reserved,\nin maturer form, for my much later and more grateful appreciation.\n\nThis weak reminiscence has obstructed, however, something more to the\npurpose, the retained impression of those choicest of our loiterings\nthat took place, still far down-town, at the Bookstore, home of delights\nand haunt of fancy. It was at the Bookstore we had called on the day of\nThe Initials and the Boon Children--and it was thence we were returning\nwith our spoil, of which the charming novel must have been but a\nfragment. My impression composed itself of many pieces; a great and\nvarious practice of burying my nose in the half-open book for the strong\nsmell of paper and printer's ink, known to us as the English smell, was\nneeded to account for it. _That_ was the exercise of the finest sense\nthat hung about us, my brother and me--or of one at least but little\nless fine than the sense for the satisfaction of which we resorted to\nThompson's and to Taylor's: it bore me company during all our returns\nfrom forages and left me persuaded that I had only to snuff up hard\nenough, fresh uncut volume in hand, to taste of the very substance of\nLondon. All our books in that age were English, at least all our\ndown-town ones--I personally recall scarce any that were not; and I take\nthe perception of that quality in them to have associated itself with\nmore fond dreams and glimmering pictures than any other one principle of\ngrowth. It was all a result of the deeply _infected_ state: I had been\nprematurely poisoned--as I shall presently explain. The Bookstore,\nfondest of my father's resorts, though I remember no more of its public\nidentity than that it further enriched the brave depth of Broadway, was\noverwhelmingly and irresistibly English, as not less tonically English\nwas our principal host there, with whom we had moreover, my father and\nI, thanks to his office, such personal and genial relations that I\nrecall seeing him grace our board at home, in company with his wife,\nwhose vocal strain and complexion and coiffure and flounces I found none\nthe less informing, none the less \"racial,\" for my not being then versed\nin the language of analysis.\n\nThe true inwardness of these rich meanings--those above all of the\nBookstore itself--was that a tradition was thus fed, a presumption thus\ncreated, a vague vision thus filled in: all expression is clumsy for so\nmystic a process. What else can have happened but that, having taken\nover, under suggestion and with singular infant promptitude, a\nparticular throbbing consciousness, I had become aware of the source at\nwhich it could best be refreshed? That consciousness, so communicated,\nwas just simply of certain impressions, certain _sources_ of impression\nagain, proceeding from over the sea and situated beyond it--or even much\nrather of my parents' own impression of such, the fruit of a happy time\nspent in and about London with their two babies and reflected in that\nportion of their talk with each other to which I best attended. Had\n_all_ their talk for its subject, in my infant ears, that happy\ntime?--did it deal only with London and Piccadilly and the Green Park,\nwhere, over against their dwelling, their two babies mainly took the air\nunder charge of Fanny of Albany, their American nurse, whose remark as\nto the degree to which the British Museum fell short for one who had had\nthe privilege of that of Albany was handed down to us? Did it never\nforbear from Windsor and Richmond and Sudbrook and Ham Common, amid the\nrich complexity of which, crowding their discourse with echoes, they\nhad spent their summer?--all a scattering of such pearls as it seemed\nthat their second-born could most deftly and instinctively pick up. Our\nsole maternal aunt, already mentioned as a devoted and cherished\npresence during those and many later years, was in a position to share\nwith them the treasure of these mild memories, which strike me as having\nfor the most part, through some bright household habit, overflowed at\nthe breakfast-table, where I regularly attended with W. J.; she had\nimbibed betimes in Europe the seeds of a long nostalgia, and I think of\nher as ever so patiently communicative on that score under pressure of\nmy artless appeal. That I should have been so inquiring while still so\ndestitute of primary data was doubtless rather an anomaly; and it was\nfor that matter quite as if my infant divination proceeded by the light\nof nature: I divined that it would matter to me in the future that\n\"English life\" should be of this or that fashion. My father had\nsubscribed for me to a small periodical of quarto form, covered in\nyellow and entitled The Charm, which shed on the question the softest\nlustre, but of which the appearances were sadly intermittent, or then\nstruck me as being; inasmuch as many of our visits to the Bookstore were\nto ask for the new number--only to learn with painful frequency that the\nlast consignment from London had arrived without it. I feel again the\npang of that disappointment--as if through the want of what I needed\nmost for going on; the English smell was exhaled by The Charm in a\npeculiar degree, and I see myself affected by the failure as by that of\na vital tonic. It was not, at the same time, by a Charm the more or the\nless that my salvation was to be, as it were, worked out, or my\nimagination at any rate duly convinced; conviction was the result of the\nvery air of home, so far as I most consciously inhaled it. This\nrepresented, no doubt, a failure to read into matters close at hand all\nthe interest they were capable of yielding; but I had taken the twist,\nhad sipped the poison, as I say, and was to feel it to that end the most\nsalutary cup. I saw my parents homesick, as I conceived, for the ancient\norder and distressed and inconvenienced by many of the more immediate\nfeatures of the modern, as the modern pressed upon us, and since their\ntheory of our better living was from an early time that we should renew\nthe quest of the ancient on the very first possibility I simply grew\ngreater in the faith that somehow to manage that would constitute\nsuccess in life. I never found myself deterred from this fond view,\nwhich was implied in every question I asked, every answer I got, and\nevery plan I formed.\n\nThose are great words for the daydream of infant ignorance, yet if\nsuccess in life may perhaps be best defined as the performance in age of\nsome intention arrested in youth I may frankly put in a claim to it. To\npress my nose against the sources of the English smell, so different for\nyoung bibliophiles from any American, was to adopt that sweetness as the\nsign of my \"atmosphere\"; roundabout might be the course to take, but one\nwas in motion from the first and one never lost sight of the goal. The\nvery names of places and things in the other world--the marked opposite\nin most ways of that in which New York and Albany, Fort Hamilton and New\nBrighton formed so fallacious a maximum--became to me values and secrets\nand shibboleths; they were probably often on my tongue and employed as\nignorance determined, but I quite recall being ashamed to use them as\nmuch as I should have liked. It was New Brighton, I reconstruct (and\nindeed definitely remember) that \"finished\" us at last--that and our\nfinal sordid school, W. J.'s and mine, in New York: the ancient order\n_had_ somehow to be invoked when such \"advantages\" as those were the\nbest within our compass and our means. Not further to anticipate, at all\nevents, that climax was for a while but vaguely in sight, and the\nillusion of felicity continued from season to season to shut us in. It\nis only of what I took for felicity, however few the years and however\nscant the scene, that I am pretending now to speak; though I shall have\nstrained the last drop of romance from this vision of our towny summers\nwith the quite sharp reminiscence of my first sitting for my\ndaguerreotype. I repaired with my father on an August day to the great\nBroadway establishment of Mr. Brady, supreme in that then beautiful art,\nand it is my impression--the only point vague with me--that though we\nhad come up by the Staten Island boat for the purpose we were to keep\nthe affair secret till the charming consequence should break, at home,\nupon my mother. Strong is my conviction that our mystery, in the event,\nyielded almost at once to our elation, for no tradition had a brighter\nhousehold life with us than that of our father's headlong impatience. He\nmoved in a cloud, if not rather in a high radiance, of precipitation and\ndivulgation, a chartered rebel against cold reserves. The good news in\nhis hand refused under any persuasion to grow stale, the sense of\ncommunicable pleasure in his breast was positively explosive; so that we\nsaw those \"surprises\" in which he had conspired with our mother for our\nbenefit converted by him in every case, under our shamelessly encouraged\nguesses, into common conspiracies against her--against her knowing, that\nis, how thoroughly we were all compromised. He had a special and\ndelightful sophistry at the service of his overflow, and never so fine a\nfancy as in defending it on \"human\" grounds. He was something very\ndifferent withal from a parent of weak mercies; weakness was never so\npositive and plausible, nor could the attitude of sparing you be more\nhandsomely or on occasion even more comically aggressive.\n\nMy small point is simply, however, that the secresy of our conjoined\nportrait was probably very soon, by his act, to begin a public and\nshining life and to enjoy it till we received the picture; as to which\nmoreover still another remembrance steals on me, a proof of the fact\nthat our adventure was improvised. Sharp again is my sense of not being\nso adequately dressed as I should have taken thought for had I foreseen\nmy exposure; though the resources of my wardrobe as then constituted\ncould surely have left me but few alternatives. The main resource of a\nsmall New York boy in this line at that time was the little sheath-like\njacket, tight to the body, closed at the neck and adorned in front with\na single row of brass buttons--a garment of scant grace assuredly and\ncompromised to my consciousness, above all, by a strange ironic light\nfrom an unforgotten source. It was but a short time before those days\nthat the great Mr. Thackeray had come to America to lecture on The\nEnglish Humourists, and still present to me is the voice proceeding from\nmy father's library, in which some glimpse of me hovering, at an opening\nof the door, in passage or on staircase, prompted him to the formidable\nwords: \"Come here, little boy, and show me your extraordinary jacket!\"\nMy sense of my jacket became from that hour a heavy one--further\nenriched as my vision is by my shyness of posture before the seated, the\ncelebrated visitor, who struck me, in the sunny light of the animated\nroom, as enormously big and who, though he laid on my shoulder the hand\nof benevolence, bent on my native costume the spectacles of wonder. I\nwas to know later on why he had been so amused and why, after asking me\nif this were the common uniform of my age and class, he remarked that in\nEngland, were I to go there, I should be addressed as \"Buttons.\" It had\nbeen revealed to me thus in a flash that we were somehow _queer_, and\nthough never exactly crushed by it I became aware that I at least felt\nso as I stood with my head in Mr. Brady's vise. Beautiful most decidedly\nthe lost art of the daguerreotype; I remember the \"exposure\" as on this\noccasion interminably long, yet with the result of a facial anguish far\nless harshly reproduced than my suffered snapshots of a later age. Too\nfew, I may here interject, were to remain my gathered impressions of the\ngreat humourist, but one of them, indeed almost the only other, bears\nagain on the play of his humour over our perversities of dress. It\nbelongs to a later moment, an occasion on which I see him familiarly\nseated with us, in Paris, during the spring of 1857, at some repast at\nwhich the younger of us too, by that time, habitually flocked, in our\naffluence of five. Our youngest was beside him, a small sister, then not\nquite in her eighth year, and arrayed apparently after the fashion of\nthe period and place; and the tradition lingered long of his having\nsuddenly laid his hand on her little flounced person and exclaimed with\nludicrous horror: \"Crinoline?--I was suspecting it! So young and so\ndepraved!\"\n\nA fainter image, that of one of the New York moments, just eludes me,\npursue it as I will; I recover but the setting and the fact of his brief\npresence in it, with nothing that was said or done beyond my being left\nwith my father to watch our distinguished friend's secretary, who was\nalso a young artist, establish his easel and proceed to paint. The\nsetting, as I recall it, was an odd, oblong, blank \"private parlour\" at\nthe Clarendon Hotel, then the latest thing in hotels, but whose ancient\ncorner of Fourth Avenue and--was it Eighteenth Street?--long ago ceased\nto know it; the gentle, very gentle, portraitist was Mr. Eyre Crowe and\nthe obliging sitter my father, who sat in response to Mr. Thackeray's\ndesire that his prot\u00c3\u00a9g\u00c3\u00a9 should find employment. The protector after a\nlittle departed, blessing the business, which took the form of a small\nfull-length of the model seated, his arm extended and the hand on the\nknob of his cane. The work, it may at this time of day be mentioned,\nfell below its general possibilities; but I note the scene through which\nI must duly have gaped and wondered (for I had as yet seen no one, least\nof all a casual acquaintance in an hotel parlour, \"really paint\"\nbefore,) as a happy example again of my parent's positive cultivation of\nmy society, it would seem, and thought for my social education. And then\nthere are other connections; I recall it as a Sunday morning, I recover\nthe place itself as a featureless void--bleak and bare, with its\ndevelopments all to come, the hotel parlour of other New York days--but\nvivid still to me is my conscious assistance for the first time at\noperations that were to mean much for many of my coming years. Those of\nquiet Mr. Crowe held me spellbound--I was to circle so wistfully, as\nfrom that beginning, round the practice of his art, which in spite of\nthese earnest approaches and intentions never on its own part in the\nleast acknowledged our acquaintance; scarcely much more than it was ever\nto respond, for that matter, to the overtures of the mild aspirant\nhimself, known to my observation long afterwards, in the London years,\nas the most touchingly resigned of the children of disappointment. Not\nonly by association was he a Thackerayan figure, but much as if the\nmaster's hand had stamped him with the outline and the value, with life\nand sweetness and patience--shown, as after the long futility, seated\nin a quiet wait, very long too, for the end. That was sad, one couldn't\nbut feel; yet it was in the oddest way impossible to take him for a\nfailure. He might have been one of fortune's, strictly; but what was\nthat when he was one of Thackeray's own successes?--in the minor line,\nbut with such a grace and such a truth, those of some dim second cousin\nto Colonel Newcome.\n\n\n\n\nVIII\n\n\nI feel that at such a rate I remember too much, and yet this mild\napparitionism is only part of it. To look back at all is to meet the\napparitional and to find in its ghostly face the silent stare of an\nappeal. When I fix it, the hovering shade, whether of person or place,\nit fixes me back and seems the less lost--not to my consciousness, for\nthat is nothing, but to its own--by my stopping however idly for it. The\nday of the daguerreotype, the August afternoon, what was it if not one\nof the days when we went to Union Square for luncheon and for more\nice-cream and more peaches and even more, even most, enjoyment of ease\naccompanied by stimulation of wonder? It may have been indeed that a\nvisit to Mrs. Cannon rather on that occasion engaged us--memory selects\na little confusedly from such a wealth of experience. For the wonder was\nthe experience, and that was everywhere, even if I didn't so much find\nit as take it with me, to be sure of not falling short. Mrs. Cannon\nlurked near Fourth Street--_that_ I abundantly grasp, not more\ndefinitely placing her than in what seemed to me a labyrinth of grave\nbye-streets westwardly \"back of\" Broadway, yet at no great distance\nfrom it, where she must have occupied a house at a corner, since we\nreached her not by steps that went up to a front door but by others that\nwent slightly down and formed clearly an independent side access, a\nfeature that affected me as rich and strange. What the steps went down\nto was a spacious room, light and friendly, so that it couldn't have\nbeen compromised by an \"area,\" which offered the brave mystification,\namid other mystifications, of being at once a parlour and a shop, a shop\nin particular for the relief of gentlemen in want of\npockethandkerchiefs, neckties, collars, umbrellas and straw-covered\nbottles of the essence known in old New York as \"Cullone\"--with a very\nlong and big O. Mrs. Cannon was always seated at some delicate white or\nother needlework, as if she herself made the collars and the neckties\nand hemmed the pockethandkerchiefs, though the air of this conflicts\nwith the sense of importation from remoter centres of fashion breathed\nby some of the more thrilling of the remarks I heard exchanged, at the\nsame time that it quickened the oddity of the place. For the oddity was\nin many things--above all perhaps in there being no counter, no rows of\nshelves and no vulgar till for Mrs. Cannon's commerce; the parlour\nclearly dissimulated the shop--and positively to that extent that I\nmight uncannily have wondered what the shop dissimulated. It\nrepresented, honestly, I made out in the course of visits that seem to\nme to have been delightfully repeated, the more informal of the\napproaches to our friend's brave background or hinterland, the realm of\nher main industry, the array of the furnished apartments for\ngentlemen--gentlemen largely for whom she imported the Eau de Cologne\nand the neckties and who struck me as principally consisting of the ever\nremarkable Uncles, desirous at times, on their restless returns from\nAlbany or wherever, of an intimacy of comfort that the New York Hotel\ncouldn't yield. Fascinating thus the implications of Mrs. Cannon's\nestablishment, where the talk took the turn, in particular, of Mr. John\nand Mr. Edward and Mr. Howard, and where Miss Maggie or Miss Susie, who\nwere on the spot in other rocking chairs and with other poised needles,\nmade their points as well as the rest of us. The interest of the place\nwas that the uncles were somehow always under discussion--as to where\nthey at the moment might be, or as to when they were expected, or above\nall as to how (the \"how\" was the great matter and the fine emphasis)\nthey had last appeared and might be conceived as carrying themselves;\nand that their consumption of neckties and Eau de Cologne was somehow\ninordinate: I might have been judging it in my innocence as their only\n_consommation_. I refer to those sources, I say, the charm of the\nscene, the finer part of which must yet have been that it didn't, as it\nregularly lapsed, dispose of _all_ mystifications. If I didn't\nunderstand, however, the beauty was that Mrs. Cannon understood (that\nwas what she did most of all, even more than hem pockethandkerchiefs and\ncollars) and my father understood, and each understood that the other\ndid, Miss Maggie and Miss Susie being no whit behind. It was only I who\ndidn't understand--save in so far as I understood _that_, which was a\nkind of pale joy; and meanwhile there would be more to come from uncles\nso attachingly, so almost portentously, discussable. The vision at any\nrate was to stick by me as through its old-world friendly grace, its\nlight on the elder amenity; the prettier manners, the tender personal\nnote in the good lady's importations and anxieties, that of the\nhand-made fabric and the discriminating service. Fit to figure as a\nvalue anywhere--by which I meant in the right corner of any social\npicture, I afterwards said to myself--that refined and composed\nsignificance of Mrs. Cannon's scene.\n\nUnion Square was a different matter, though with the element there also\nthat I made out that I _didn't_ make out (my sense of drama was in this\ncase, I think, rather more frightened off than led on;) a drawback for\nwhich, however, I consoled myself by baked apples and custards, an\ninveterate feature of our Sunday luncheon there (those of weekdays\nbeing various and casual) and by a study of a great store, as it seemed\nto me, of steel-plated volumes, devoted mainly to the heroines of\nRomance, with one in particular, presenting those of Shakespeare, in\nwhich the plates were so artfully coloured and varnished, and complexion\nand dress thereby so endeared to memory, that it was for long afterwards\na shock to me at the theatre not to see just those bright images, with\ntheir peculiar toggeries, come on. I was able but the other day,\nmoreover, to renew almost on the very spot the continuity of\ncontemplation; large lumpish presences, precarious creations of a day,\nseemed to have elbowed out of the Square all but one or two of the minor\nmonuments, pleasant appreciable things, of the other time; yet close to\nUniversity Place the old house of the picture-books and the custards and\nthe domestic situation had, though disfigured and overscored, not quite\nreceived its death-stroke; I disengaged, by a mere identification of\nobscured window and profaned portico, a whole chapter of history; which\nfact should indeed be a warning to penetration, a practical plea here\nfor the superficial--by its exhibition of the rate at which the\nrelations of any gage of experience multiply and ramify from the moment\nthe mind begins to handle it. I pursued a swarm of such relations, on\nthe occasion I speak of, up and down West Fourteenth Street and over to\nSeventh Avenue, running most of them to earth with difficulty, but\nfinding them at half a dozen points quite confess to a queer stale\nsameness. The gage of experience, as I say, had in these cases been\nstrangely spared--the sameness had in two or three of them held out as\nwith conscious craft. But these are impressions I shall presently find\nit impossible not to take up again at any cost.\n\nI first \"realised\" Fourteenth Street at a very tender age, and I\nperfectly recall that flush of initiation, consisting as it did of an\nafternoon call with my father at a house there situated, one of an\nalready fairly mature row on the south side and quite near Sixth Avenue.\nIt was as \"our\" house, just acquired by us, that he thus invited my\napproval of it--heaping as that does once more the measure of my small\nadhesiveness. I thoroughly approved--quite as if I had foreseen that the\nplace was to become to me for ever so long afterwards a sort of\nanchorage of the spirit, being at the hour as well a fascination for the\neyes, since it was there I first fondly gaped at the process of\n\"decorating.\" I saw charming men in little caps ingeniously formed of\nfolded newspaper--where in the roaring city are those quaint badges of\nthe handicrafts now?--mounted on platforms and casting plaster into\nmoulds; I saw them in particular paste long strips of yellowish grained\npaper upon walls, and I vividly remember thinking the grain and the\npattern (for there was a pattern from waist-high down, a complication of\ndragons and sphinxes and scrolls and other fine flourishes) a wonderful\nand sumptuous thing. I would give much, I protest, to recover its lost\nsecret, to see what it really was--so interesting ever to retrace, and\nsometimes so difficult of belief, in a community of one's own knowing,\nis the general \u00c3\u00a6sthetic adventure, are the dangers and delusions, the\nall but fatal accidents and mortal ailments, that Taste has smilingly\nsurvived and after which the fickle creature may still quite brazenly\nlook one in the face. Our quarter must have bristled in those years with\nthe very worst of the danger-signals--though indeed they figured but as\ncoarse complacencies; the age of \"brown stone\" had just been ushered in,\nand that material, in deplorable, in monstrous form, over all the vacant\nspaces and eligible sites then numerous between the Fifth and Sixth\nAvenues, more and more affronted the day. We seemed to have come up from\na world of quieter harmonies, the world of Washington Square and\nthereabouts, so decent in its dignity, so instinctively unpretentious.\nThere were even there spots of shabbiness that I recall, such as the\ncharmless void reaching westward from the two houses that formed the\nFifth Avenue corner to our grandfather's, our New York grandfather's\nhouse, itself built by him, with the happiest judgment, not so long\nbefore, and at no distant time in truth to be solidly but much less\npleasingly neighboured. The ancient name of the Parade-ground still hung\nabout the central space, and the ancient wooden palings, then so\ngenerally accounted proper for central spaces--the whole image\ninfinitely recedes--affected even my innocent childhood as rustic and\nmean. Union Square, at the top of the Avenue--or what practically then\ncounted for the top--was encased, more smartly, in iron rails and\nfurther adorned with a fountain and an aged amateur-looking constable,\nawful to my generation in virtue of his star and his switch. I associate\nless elegance with the Parade-ground, into which we turned for\nrecreation from my neighbouring dame's-school and where the parades\ndeployed on no scale to check our own evolutions; though indeed the\nswitch of office abounded there, for what I best recover in the\nconnection is a sense and smell of perpetual autumn, with the ground so\nmuffled in the leaves and twigs of the now long defunct ailanthus-tree\nthat most of our own motions were a kicking of them up--the semi-sweet\nrankness of the plant was all in the air--and small boys pranced about\nas cavaliers whacking their steeds. There were bigger boys, bolder\nstill, to whom this vegetation, or something kindred that escapes me,\nyielded long black beanlike slips which they lighted and smoked, the\nsmaller ones staring and impressed; I at any rate think of the small one\nI can best speak for as constantly wading through an Indian summer of\nthese _disjecta_, fascinated by the leaf-kicking process, the joy of\nlonely trudges, over a course in which those parts and the slightly more\nnorthward pleasantly confound themselves. These were the homely joys of\nthe nobler neighbourhood, elements that had their match, and more, hard\nby the Fourteenth Street home, in the poplars, the pigs, the poultry,\nand the \"Irish houses,\" two or three in number, exclusive of a very fine\nDutch one, seated then, this last, almost as among gardens and groves--a\nbreadth of territory still apparent, on the spot, in that marginal ease,\nthat spread of occupation, to the nearly complete absence of which New\nYork aspects owe their general failure of \"style.\"\n\nBut there were finer vibrations as well--for the safely-prowling infant,\nthough none perhaps so fine as when he stood long and drank deep at\nthose founts of romance that gushed from the huge placards of the\ntheatre. These announcements, at a day when advertisement was\ncontentedly but information, had very much the form of magnified\nplaybills; they consisted of vast oblong sheets, yellow or white, pasted\nupon tall wooden screens or into hollow sockets, and acquainting the\npossible playgoer with every circumstance that might seriously interest\nhim. These screens rested sociably against trees and lamp-posts as well\nas against walls and fences, to all of which they were, I suppose,\nfamiliarly attached; but the sweetest note of their confidence was that,\nin parallel lines and the good old way, characters facing performers,\nthey gave the whole cast, which in the \"palmy days\" of the drama often\ninvolved many names. I catch myself again in the fact of endless\nstations in Fifth Avenue near the southwest corner of Ninth Street, as I\nthink it must have been, since the dull long \"run\" didn't exist then for\nthe young _badaud_ and the poster there was constantly and bravely\nrenewed. It engaged my attention, whenever I passed, as the canvas of a\ngreat master in a great gallery holds that of the pious tourist, and\neven though I can't at this day be sure of its special reference I was\nwith precocious passion \"at home\" among the theatres--thanks to our\nparents' fond interest in them (as from this distance I see it flourish\nfor the time) and to the liberal law and happy view under which the\naddiction was shared with us, they never caring much for things we\ncouldn't care for and generally holding that what was good to them would\nbe also good for their children. It had the effect certainly of\npreparing for these, so far as we should incline to cherish it, a\nstrange little fund of theatrical reminiscence, a small hoard of\nmemories maintaining itself in my own case for a lifetime and causing\nme to wonder to-day, before its abundance, on how many evenings of the\nmonth, or perhaps even of the week, we were torn from the pursuits of\nhome.\n\n\n\n\nIX\n\n\nThe truth is doubtless, however, much less in the wealth of my\nexperience than in the tenacity of my impression, the fact that I have\nlost nothing of what I saw and that though I can't now quite divide the\ntotal into separate occasions the various items surprisingly swarm for\nme. I shall return to some of them, wishing at present only to make my\npoint of when and how the seeds were sown that afterwards so thickly\nsprouted and flowered. I was greatly to love the drama, at its best, as\na \"form\"; whatever variations of faith or curiosity I was to know in\nrespect to the infirm and inadequate theatre. There was of course\nanciently no question for us of the drama at its best; and indeed while\nI lately by chance looked over a copious collection of theatrical\nportraits, beginning with the earliest age of lithography and\nphotography as so applied, and documentary in the highest degree on the\npersonalities, as we nowadays say, of the old American stage,\nstupefaction grew sharp in me and scepticism triumphed, so vulgar, so\nbarbarous, seemed the array of types, so extraordinarily provincial the\nnote of every figure, so less than scant the claim of such\nphysiognomies and such reputations. Rather dismal, everywhere, I admit,\nthe histrionic image with the artificial lights turned off--the fatigued\nand disconnected face reduced to its mere self and resembling some\nclosed and darkened inn with the sign still swung but the place blighted\nfor want of custom. That consideration weighs; but what a \"gang,\" all\nthe same, when thus left to their own devices, the performers, men and\nwomen alike, of that world of queer appreciations! I ought perhaps to\nbear on them lightly in view of what in especial comes back to me; the\nsense of the sacred thrill with which I began to watch the green\ncurtain, the particular one that was to rise to The Comedy of Errors on\nthe occasion that must have been, for what I recall of its almost\nunbearable intensity, the very first of my ever sitting at a play. I\nshould have been indebted for the momentous evening in that case to Mr.\nWilliam Burton, whose small theatre in Chambers Street, to the rear of\nStewart's big shop and hard by the Park, as the Park was at that time\nunderstood, offered me then my prime initiation. Let me not complain of\nmy having owed the adventure to a still greater William as well, nor\nthink again without the right intensity, the scarce tolerable throb, of\nthe way the torment of the curtain was mixed, half so dark a defiance\nand half so rich a promise. One's eyes bored into it in vain, and yet\none knew it _would_ rise at the named hour, the only question being if\none could exist till then. The play had been read to us during the day;\na celebrated English actor, whose name I inconsistently forget, had\narrived to match Mr. Burton as the other of the Dromios; and the\nagreeable Mrs. Holman, who had to my relentless vision too retreating a\nchin, was so good as to represent Adriana. I regarded Mrs. Holman as a\nfriend, though in no warmer light than that in which I regarded Miss\nMary Taylor--save indeed that Mrs. Holman had the pull, on one's\naffections, of \"coming out\" to sing in white satin and quite\nirrelevantly between the acts; an advantage she shared with the younger\nand fairer and more dashing, the dancing, Miss Malvina, who footed it\nand tambourined it and shawled it, irruptively, in lonely state. When\nnot admiring Mr. Burton in Shakespeare we admired him as Paul Pry, as\nMr. Toodles and as Aminadab Sleek in The Serious Family, and we must\nhave admired him very much--his huge fat person, his huge fat face and\nhis vast slightly pendulous cheek, surmounted by a sort of elephantine\nwink, to which I impute a remarkable baseness, being still perfectly\npresent to me.\n\nWe discriminated, none the less; we thought Mr. Blake a much finer\ncomedian, much more of a gentleman and a scholar--\"mellow\" Mr. Blake,\nwhom with the brave and emphatic Mrs. Blake (_how_ they must have made\ntheir points!) I connect partly with the Burton scene and partly with\nthat, of slightly subsequent creation, which, after flourishing awhile\nslightly further up Broadway under the charmlessly commercial name of\nBrougham's Lyceum (we had almost only Lyceums and Museums and Lecture\nRooms and Academies of Music for playhouse and opera then,) entered upon\na long career and a migratory life as Wallack's Theatre. I fail\ndoubtless to keep _all_ my associations clear, but what is important, or\nwhat I desire at least to make pass for such, is that when we most\nadmired Mr. Blake we also again admired Miss Mary Taylor; and it was at\nBrougham's, not at Burton's, that we rendered _her_ that\ntribute--reserved for her performance of the fond theatrical daughter in\nthe English version of Le P\u00c3\u00a8re de la D\u00c3\u00a9butante, where I see the charming\npanting dark-haired creature, in flowing white classically relieved by a\ngold tiara and a golden scarf, rush back from the supposed stage to the\nrepresented green-room, followed by thunders of applause, and throw\nherself upon the neck of the broken-down old gentleman in a blue coat\nwith brass buttons who must have been after all, on second thoughts, Mr.\nPlacide. Greater flights or more delicate shades the art of pathetic\ncomedy was at that time held not to achieve; only I straighten it out\nthat Mr. and Mrs. Blake, not less than Miss Mary Taylor (who\npreponderantly haunts my vision, even to the disadvantage of Miss Kate\nHorn in Nan the Good-for-Nothing, until indeed she is displaced by the\nbrilliant Laura Keene) did migrate to Brougham's, where we found them\nall themselves as Goldsmith's Hardcastle pair and other like matters. We\nrallied especially to Blake as Dogberry, on the occasion of my second\nShakespearean night, for as such I seem to place it, when Laura Keene\nand Mr. Lester--the Lester Wallack that was to be--did Beatrice and\nBenedick. I yield to this further proof that we had our proportion of\nShakespeare, though perhaps antedating that rapt vision of Much Ado,\nwhich may have been preceded by the dazzled apprehension of A Midsummer\nNight's Dream at the Broadway (there _was_ a confessed Theatre;) this\nlatter now present to me in every bright particular. It supplied us, we\nmust have felt, our greatest conceivable adventure--I cannot otherwise\naccount for its emerging so clear. Everything here is as of yesterday,\nthe identity of the actors, the details of their dress, the charm\nimparted by the sisters Gougenheim, the elegant elder as the infatuated\nHelena and the other, the roguish \"Joey\" as the mischievous Puck. Hermia\nwas Mrs. Nagle, in a short salmon-coloured peplum over a white\npetticoat, the whole bulgingly confined by a girdle of shining gilt and\nforming a contrast to the loose scarves of Helena, while Mr. Nagle, not\ndevoid, I seem to remember, of a blue chin and the latency of a fine\nbrogue, was either Lysander or Demetrius; Mr. Davidge (also, I surmise,\nwith a brogue) was Bottom the weaver and Madame Ponisi Oberon--Madame\nPonisi whose range must have been wide, since I see her also as the\nwhite-veiled heroine of The Cataract of the Ganges, where, preferring\ndeath to dishonour, she dashes up the more or less perpendicular\nwaterfall on a fiery black steed and with an effect only a little\nblighted by the chance flutter of a drapery out of which peeps the leg\nof a trouser and a big male foot; and then again, though presumably at a\nsomewhat later time or, in strictness, _after_ childhood's fond hour, as\nthis and that noble matron or tragedy queen. I descry her at any rate as\nrepresenting all characters alike with a broad brown face framed in\nbands or crowns or other heavy headgear out of which cropped a row of\nvery small tight black curls. The Cataract of the Ganges is all there as\nwell, a tragedy of temples and idols and wicked rajahs and real water,\nwith Davidge and Joey Gougenheim again for comic relief--though all in a\ncoarser radiance, thanks to the absence of fairies and Amazons and\nmoonlit mechanical effects, the charm above all, so seen, of the play\nwithin the play; and I rank it in that relation with Green Bushes,\ndespite the celebrity in the latter of Madame C\u00c3\u00a9leste, who came to us\nstraight out of London and whose admired walk up the stage as Miami the\nhuntress, a wonderful majestic and yet voluptuous stride enhanced by a\nshort kilt, black velvet leggings and a gun haughtily borne on the\nshoulder, is vividly before me as I write. The piece in question was, I\nrecall, from the pen of Mr. Bourcicault, as he then wrote his name--he\nwas so early in the field and must have been from long before, inasmuch\nas he now appears to me to have supplied Mr. Brougham, of the Lyceum\naforesaid, with his choicest productions.\n\nI sit again at London Assurance, with Mrs. Wallack--\"Fanny\" Wallack, I\nthink, not that I quite know who she was--as Lady Gay Spanker, flushed\nand vociferous, first in a riding-habit with a tail yards long and\nafterwards in yellow satin with scarce a tail at all; I am present also\nat Love in a Maze, in which the stage represented, with primitive art I\nfear, a supposedly intricate garden-labyrinth, and in which I admired\nfor the first time Mrs. Russell, afterwards long before the public as\nMrs. Hoey, even if opining that she wanted, especially for the\nlow-necked ordeal, less osseous a structure. There are pieces of that\ngeneral association, I admit, the clue to which slips from me; the drama\nof modern life and of French origin--though what was then not of French\norigin?--in which Miss Julia Bennett, fresh from triumphs at the\nHaymarket, made her first appearance, in a very becoming white bonnet,\neither as a brilliant adventuress or as the innocent victim of\nlicentious design, I forget which, though with a sense somehow that the\nwhite bonnet, when of true elegance, was the note at that period of the\nadventuress; Miss Julia Bennett with whom at a later age one was to\nrenew acquaintance as the artful and ample Mrs. Barrow, full of manner\nand presence and often Edwin Booth's Portia, Desdemona and Julie de\nMortemer. I figure her as having in the dimmer phase succeeded to Miss\nLaura Keene at Wallack's on the secession thence of this original\ncharmer of our parents, the flutter of whose prime advent is perfectly\npresent to me, with the relish expressed for that \"English\" sweetness of\nher speech (I already wondered why it _shouldn't_ be English) which was\nnot as the speech mostly known to us. The Uncles, within my hearing,\neven imitated, for commendation, some of her choicer sounds, to which I\nstrained my ear on seeing her afterwards as Mrs. Chillington in the\nrefined comedietta of A Morning Call, where she made delightful game of\nMr. Lester as Sir Edward Ardent, even to the point of causing him to\ncrawl about on all fours and covered with her shawl after the fashion of\na horse-blanket. That delightful impression was then unconscious of the\nblight to come--that of my apprehending, years after, that the\nbrilliant comedietta was the tribute of our Anglo-Saxon taste to Alfred\nde Musset's elegant proverb of the Porte Ouverte ou Ferm\u00c3\u00a9e, in which\nnothing could find itself less at home than the horseplay of the English\nversion. Miss Laura Keene, with a native grace at the start, a fresh and\ndelicate inspiration, I infer from the kind of pleasure she appears to\nhave begun with giving, was to live to belie her promise and, becoming\nhard and raddled, forfeit (on the evidence) all claim to the higher\ndistinction; a fact not surprising under the lurid light projected by\nsuch a sign of the atmosphere of ineptitude as an accepted and condoned\nperversion to vulgarity of Musset's perfect little work. How _could_\nquality of talent consort with so dire an absence of quality in the\nmaterial offered it? where could such lapses lead but to dust and\ndesolation and what happy instinct not be smothered in an air so\ndismally non-conducting? Is it a foolish fallacy that these matters may\nhave been on occasion, at that time, worth speaking of? is it only\npresumable that everything was perfectly cheap and common and everyone\nperfectly bad and barbarous and that even the least corruptible of our\ntypical spectators were too easily beguiled and too helplessly kind? The\nbeauty of the main truth as to any remembered matter looked at in due\ndetachment, or in other words through the haze of time, is that\ncomprehension has then become one with criticism, compassion, as it may\nreally be called, one with musing vision, and the whole company of the\nanciently restless, with their elations and mistakes, their sincerities\nand fallacies and vanities and triumphs, embalmed for us in the mild\nessence of their collective submission to fate. We needn't be strenuous\nabout them unless we particularly want to, and are glad to remember in\nseason all that this would imply of the strenuous about our own\n_origines_, our muddled initiations. If nothing is more certain for us\nthan that many persons, within our recollection, couldn't help being\nrather generally unadmonished and unaware, so nothing is more in the\nnote of peace than that such a perceived state, pushed to a point, makes\nour scales of judgment but ridiculously rattle. _Our_ admonition, our\nsuperior awareness, is of many things--and, among these, of how\ninfinitely, at the worst, they lived, the pale superseded, and how much\nit was by their virtue.\n\nWhich reflections, in the train of such memories as those just gathered,\nmay perhaps seem over-strained--though they really to my own eyes cause\nthe images to multiply. Still others of these break in upon me and\nrefuse to be slighted; reconstituting as I practically am the history of\nmy fostered imagination, for whatever it may be worth, I won't pretend\nto a disrespect for _any_ contributive particle. I left myself just\nabove staring at the Fifth Avenue poster, and I can't but linger there\nwhile the vision it evokes insists on swarming. It was the age of the\narrangements of Dickens for the stage, vamped-up promptly on every scene\nand which must have been the roughest theatrical tinkers' work, but at\ntwo or three of which we certainly assisted. I associate them with Mr.\nBrougham's temple of the art, yet am at the same time beset with the\nCaptain Cuttle of Dombey and Son in the form of the big Burton, who\nnever, I earnestly conceive, graced that shrine, so that I wander a\ntrifle confusedly. Isn't it he whom I remember as a monstrous Micawber,\nthe coarse parody of a charming creation, with the entire baldness of a\nhuge Easter egg and collar-points like the sails of Mediterranean\nfeluccas? Dire of course for all temperance in these connections was the\nneed to conform to the illustrations of Phiz, himself already an\nimprovising parodist and happy only so long as not imitated, not\nliterally reproduced. Strange enough the \"\u00c3\u00a6sthetic\" of artists who could\ndesire but literally to reproduce. I give the whole question up,\nhowever, I stray too in the dust, and with a positive sense of having,\nin the first place, but languished at home when my betters admired Miss\nCushman--terribly out of the picture and the frame we should to-day\npronounce her, I fear--as the Nancy of Oliver Twist: as far away this\nmust have been as the lifetime of the prehistoric \"Park,\" to which it\nwas just within my knowledge that my elders went for opera, to come back\non us sounding those rich old Italian names, Bosio and Badiali, Ronconi\nand Steffanone, I am not sure I have them quite right; signs, of a\nrueful sound to us, that the line as to our infant participation _was_\nsomewhere drawn. It had not been drawn, I all the more like to remember,\nwhen, under proper protection, at Castle Garden, I listened to that\nrarest of infant phenomena, Adelina Patti, poised in an armchair that\nhad been pushed to the footlights and announcing her incomparable gift.\nShe was about of our own age, she was one of us, even though at the same\ntime the most prodigious of fairies, of glittering fables. That\nprinciple of selection was indeed in abeyance while I sat with my mother\neither at Tripler Hall or at Niblo's--I am vague about the occasion, but\nthe names, as for fine old confused reasons, plead alike to my pen--and\npaid a homage quite other than critical, I dare say, to the then\nslightly worn Henrietta Sontag, Countess Rossi, who struck us as\nsupremely elegant in pink silk and white lace flounces and with whom\nthere had been for certain members of our circle some contact or\nintercourse that I have wonderingly lost. I learned at that hour in any\ncase what \"acclamation\" might mean, and have again before me the vast\nhigh-piled auditory thundering applause at the beautiful pink lady's\nclear bird-notes; a thrilling, a tremendous experience and my sole other\nmemory of concert-going, at that age, save the impression of a strange\nhuddled hour in some smaller public place, some very minor hall, under\ndim lamps and again in my mother's company, where we were so near the\nimprovised platform that my nose was brushed by the petticoats of the\ndistinguished amateur who sang \"Casta Diva,\" a very fine fair woman with\na great heaving of bosom and flirt of crinoline, and that the ringletted\nItalian gentleman in black velvet and a romantic voluminous cloak who\nrepresented, or rather who professionally and uncontrollably was, an\nImprovisatore, had for me the effect, as I crouched gaping, of quite\nbellowing down my throat. That occasion, I am clear, was a concert for a\ncharity, with the volunteer performance and the social patroness, and it\nhad squeezed in where it would--at the same time that I somehow connect\nthe place, in Broadway, on the right going down and not much below\nFourth Street (except that everything seems to me to have been just\nbelow Fourth Street when not just above,) with the scene of my great\npublic exposure somewhat later, the wonderful exhibition of Signor\nBlitz, the peerless conjurer, who, on my attending his entertainment\nwith W. J. and our frequent comrade of the early time \"Hal\" Coster,\npractised on my innocence to seduce me to the stage and there plunge me\ninto the shame of my sad failure to account arithmetically for his\nbewilderingly subtracted or added or divided pockethandkerchiefs and\nplaying-cards; a paralysis of wit as to which I once more, and with the\nsame wan despair, feel my companions' shy telegraphy of relief, their\nsnickerings and mouthings and raised numerical fingers, reach me from\nthe benches.\n\nThe second definite matter in the Dickens connection is the Smike of\nMiss Weston--whose pr\u00c3\u00a6nomen I frivolously forget (though I fear it was\nLizzie,) but who was afterwards Mrs. E. L. Davenport and then, sequently\nto some public strife or chatter, Mrs. Charles Matthews--in a version of\nNicholas Nickleby that gracelessly managed to be all tearful melodrama,\nlong-lost foundlings, wicked Ralph Nicklebys and scowling Arthur Grides,\nwith other baffled villains, and scarcely at all Crummleses and\nKenwigses, much less Squeerses; though there must have been something of\nDotheboys Hall for the proper tragedy of Smike and for the broad\nYorkshire effect, a precious theatrical value, of John Brodie. The\nineffaceability was the anguish, to my tender sense, of Nicholas's\nstarved and tattered and fawning and whining prot\u00c3\u00a9g\u00c3\u00a9; in face of my\nsharp retention of which through all the years who shall deny the\nimmense authority of the theatre, or that the stage is the mightiest of\nmodern engines? Such at least was to be the force of the Dickens\nimprint, however applied, in the soft clay of our generation; it was to\nresist so serenely the wash of the waves of time. To be brought up thus\nagainst the author of it, or to speak at all of the dawn of one's early\nconsciousness of it and of his presence and power, is to begin to tread\nground at once sacred and boundless, the associations of which, looming\nlarge, warn us off even while they hold. He did too much for us surely\never to leave us free--free of judgment, free of reaction, even should\nwe care to be, which heaven forbid: he laid his hand on us in a way to\nundermine as in no other case the power of detached appraisement. We\nreact against other productions of the general kind without \"liking\"\nthem the less, but we somehow liked Dickens the more for having\nforfeited half the claim to appreciation. That process belongs to the\nfact that criticism, roundabout him, is somehow futile and tasteless.\nHis own taste is easily impugned, but he entered so early into the blood\nand bone of our intelligence that it always remained better than the\ntaste of overhauling him. When I take him up to-day and find myself\nholding off, I simply stop: not holding off, that is, but holding on,\nand from the very fear to do so; which sounds, I recognise, like\nperusal, like renewal, of the scantest. I don't renew, I wouldn't renew\nfor the world; wouldn't, that is, with one's treasure so hoarded in the\ndusty chamber of youth, let in the intellectual air. Happy the house of\nlife in which such chambers still hold out, even with the draught of the\nintellect whistling through the passages. We were practically\ncontemporary, contemporary with the issues, the fluttering monthly\nnumbers--that was the point; it made for us a good fortune, constituted\nfor us in itself romance, on which nothing, to the end, succeeds in\nlaying its hands.\n\nThe whole question dwells for me in a single small reminiscence, though\nthere are others still: that of my having been sent to bed one evening,\nin Fourteenth Street, as a very small boy, at an hour when, in the\nlibrary and under the lamp, one of the elder cousins from Albany, the\nyoungest of an orphaned brood of four, of my grandmother's most\nextravagant adoption, had begun to read aloud to my mother the new,\nwhich must have been the first, instalment of David Copperfield. I had\nfeigned to withdraw, but had only retreated to cover close at hand, the\nfriendly shade of some screen or drooping table-cloth, folded up behind\nwhich and glued to the carpet, I held my breath and listened. I listened\nlong and drank deep while the wondrous picture grew, but the tense cord\nat last snapped under the strain of the Murdstones and I broke into the\nsobs of sympathy that disclosed my subterfuge. I was this time\neffectively banished, but the ply then taken was ineffaceable. I\nremember indeed just afterwards finding the sequel, in especial the vast\nextrusion of the Micawbers, beyond my actual capacity; which took a few\nyears to grow adequate--years in which the general contagious\nconsciousness, and our own household response not least, breathed\nheavily through Hard Times, Bleak House and Little Dorrit; the seeds of\nacquaintance with Chuzzlewit and Dombey and Son, these coming thickly\non, I had found already sown. I was to feel that I had been born, born\nto a rich awareness, under the very meridian; there sprouted in those\nyears no such other crop of ready references as the golden harvest of\nCopperfield. Yet if I was to wait to achieve the happier of these\nrecognitions I had already pored over Oliver Twist--albeit now uncertain\nof the relation borne by that experience to the incident just recalled.\nWhen Oliver was new to me, at any rate, he was already old to my\nbetters; whose view of his particular adventures and exposures must have\nbeen concerned, I think, moreover, in the fact of my public and lively\nwonder about them. It was an exhibition deprecated--to infant innocence\nI judge; unless indeed my remembrance of enjoying it only on the terms\nof fitful snatches in another, though a kindred, house is due mainly to\nthe existence there of George Cruikshank's splendid form of the work,\nof which our own foreground was clear. It perhaps even seemed to me more\nCruikshank's than Dickens's; it was a thing of such vividly terrible\nimages, and all marked with that peculiarity of Cruikshank that the\noffered flowers or goodnesses, the scenes and figures intended to\ncomfort and cheer, present themselves under his hand as but more subtly\nsinister, or more suggestively queer, than the frank badnesses and\nhorrors. The nice people and the happy moments, in the plates,\nfrightened me almost as much as the low and the awkward; which didn't\nhowever make the volumes a source of attraction the less toward that\nhigh and square old back-parlour just westward of Sixth Avenue (as we in\nthe same street were related to it) that formed, romantically, half our\nalternative domestic field and offered to our small inquiring steps a\nlarger range and privilege. If the Dickens of those years was, as I have\njust called him, the great actuality of the current imagination, so I at\nonce meet him in force as a feature even of conditions in which he was\nbut indirectly involved.\n\nFor the other house, the house we most haunted after our own, was that\nof our cousin Albert, still another of the blest orphans, though this\ntime of our mother's kindred; and if it was my habit, as I have hinted,\nto attribute to orphans as orphans a circumstantial charm, a setting\nnecessarily more delightful than our father'd and mother'd one, so\nthere spread about this appointed comrade, the perfection of the type,\ninasmuch as he alone was neither brother'd nor sister'd, an air of\npossibilities that were none the less vivid for being quite indefinite.\nHe was to embody in due course, poor young man, some of these\npossibilities--those that had originally been for me the vaguest of all;\nbut to fix his situation from my present view is not so much to wonder\nthat it spoke to me of a wild freedom as to see in it the elements of a\nrich and rounded picture. The frame was still there but a short time\nsince, cracked and empty, broken and gaping, like those few others, of\nthe general overgrown scene, that my late quest had puzzled out; and\nthis has somehow helped me to read back into it the old figures and the\nold long story, told as with excellent art. We knew the figures well\nwhile they lasted and had with them the happiest relation, but without\ndoing justice to their truth of outline, their felicity of character and\nforce of expression and function, above all to the compositional harmony\nin which they moved. That lives again to my considering eyes, and I\nadmire as never before the fine artistry of fate. Our cousin's guardian,\nthe natural and the legal, was his aunt, his only one, who was the\ncousin of our mother and our own aunt, virtually _our_ only one, so far\nas a felt and adopted closeness of kinship went; and the three,\ndaughters of two sole and much-united sisters, had been so brought up\ntogether as to have quite all the signs and accents of the same strain\nand the same nest. The cousin Helen of our young prospect was thus all\nbut the sister Helen of our mother's lifetime, as was to happen, and was\nscarcely less a stout brave presence and an emphasised character for the\nnew generation than for the old; noted here as she is, in particular,\nfor her fine old-time value of clearness and straightness. I see in her\nstrong simplicity, that of an earlier, quieter world, a New York of\nbetter manners and better morals and homelier beliefs, the very elements\nof some portrait by a grave Dutch or other truth-seeking master; she\nlooks out with some of the strong marks, the anxious honesty, the modest\nhumour, the folded resting hands, the dark handsome serious attire, the\nimportant composed cap, almost the badge of a guild or an order, that\nhang together about the images of past worthies, of whichever sex, who\nhave had, as one may say, the courage of their character, and qualify\nthem for places in great collections. I note with appreciation that she\nwas strenuously, actively good, and have the liveliest impression both\nthat no one was ever better, and that her goodness somehow testifies for\nthe whole tone of a society, a remarkable cluster of private decencies.\nHer value to my imagination is even most of all perhaps in her mere\nlocal consistency, her fine old New York ignorance and rigour. Her\ntraditions, scant but stiff, had grown there, close to her--they were\nall she needed, and she lived by them candidly and stoutly. That there\nhave been persons so little doubtful of duty helps to show us how\nsocieties grow. A proportionately small amount of absolute conviction\nabout it will carry, we thus make out, a vast dead weight of mere\ncomparative. She was as anxious over hers indeed as if it had ever been\nin question--which is a proof perhaps that being void of imagination,\nwhen you are quite entirely void, makes scarcely more for comfort than\nhaving too much, which only makes in a manner for a homeless freedom or\neven at the worst for a questioned veracity. With a big installed\nconscience there is virtue in a grain of the figurative faculty--it acts\nas oil to the stiff machine.\n\nYet this life of straight and narrow insistences seated so clearly in\nour view didn't take up all the room in the other house, the house of\nthe pictured, the intermittent Oliver, though of the fewer books in\ngeneral than ours, and of the finer proportions and less peopled spaces\n(there were but three persons to fill them) as well as of the more\nturbaned and powdered family portraits, one of these, the most antique,\na \"French pastel,\" which must have been charming, of a young collateral\nancestor who had died on the European tour. A vast marginal range\nseemed to me on the contrary to surround the adolescent nephew, who was\nsome three years, I judge, beyond me in age and had other horizons and\nprospects than ours. No question of \"Europe,\" for him, but a patriotic\npreparation for acquaintance with the South and West, or what was then\ncalled the West--he was to \"see his own country first,\" winking at us\nwhile he did so; though he was, in spite of differences, so nearly and\nnaturally neighbour'd and brother'd with us that the extensions of his\nrange and the charms of his position counted somehow as the limits and\nthe humilities of ours. He went neither to our schools nor to our\nhotels, but hovered out of our view in some other educational air that I\ncan't now point to, and had in a remote part of the State a vast wild\nproperty of his own, known as the Beaverkill, to which, so far from his\naunt's and his uncle's taking him there, he affably took them, and to\nwhich also he vainly invited W. J. and me, pointing thereby to us,\nhowever, though indirectly enough perhaps, the finest childish case we\nwere to know for the famous acceptance of the inevitable. It was\napparently not to be thought of that instead of the inevitable we should\naccept the invitation; the place was in the wilderness, incalculably\ndistant, reached by a whole day's rough drive from the railroad, through\nevery danger of flood and field, with prowling bears thrown in and\nprobable loss of limb, of which there were sad examples, from swinging\nscythes and axes; but we of course measured our privation just by those\nfacts, and grew up, so far as we did then grow, to believe that\npleasures beyond price had been cruelly denied us. I at any rate myself\ngrew up sufficiently to wonder if poor Albert's type, as it developed to\nthe anxious elder view from the first, mightn't rather have undermined\ncountenance; his pleasant foolish face and odd shy air of being\nsuspected or convicted on grounds less vague to himself than to us may\nwell have appeared symptoms of the course, of the \"rig,\" he was\neventually to run. I could think of him but as the _fils de famille_\nideally constituted; not that I could then use for him that designation,\nbut that I felt he must belong to an important special class, which he\nin fact formed in his own person. Everything was right, truly, for these\nfelicities--to speak of them only as dramatic or pictorial values; since\nif we were present all the while at more of a drama than we knew, so at\nleast, to my vague divination, the scene and the figures were there, not\nexcluding the chorus, and I must have had the instinct of their being as\nright as possible. I see the actors move again through the high, rather\nbedimmed rooms--it is always a matter of winter twilight, firelight,\nlamplight; each one appointed to his or her part and perfect for the\npicture, which gave a sense of fulness without ever being crowded.\n\nThat composition had to wait awhile, in the earliest time, to find its\nproper centre, having been from the free point of view I thus cultivate\na little encumbered by the presence of the most aged of our relatives,\nthe oldest person I remember to have familiarly known--if it can be\ncalled familiar to have stood off in fear of such strange proofs of\naccomplished time: our Great-aunt Wyckoff, our maternal grandmother's\nelder sister, I infer, and an image of living antiquity, as I figure her\nto-day, that I was never to see surpassed. I invest her in this vision\nwith all the idol-quality that may accrue to the venerable--solidly\nseated or even throned, hooded and draped and tucked-in, with big\nprotective protrusive ears to her chair which helped it to the effect of\na shrine, and a large face in which the odd blackness of eyebrow and of\na couple of other touches suggested the conventional marks of a painted\nimage. She signified her wants as divinities do, for I recover from her\npresence neither sound nor stir, remembering of her only that, as\ndescribed by her companions, the pious ministrants, she had \"said\" so\nand so when she hadn't spoken at all. Was she really, as she seemed, so\ntremendously old, so old that her daughter, our mother's cousin Helen\nand ours, would have had to come to her in middle life to account for\nit, or did antiquity at that time set in earlier and was surrender of\nappearance and dress, matching the intrinsic decay, only more\ncomplacent, more submissive and, as who should say, more abject? I have\nmy choice of these suppositions, each in its way of so lively an\ninterest that I scarce know which to prefer, though inclining perhaps a\nlittle to the idea of the backward reach. If Aunt Wyckoff was, as I\nfirst remember her, scarce more than seventy, say, the thought fills me\nwith one sort of joy, the joy of our modern, our so generally greater\nand nobler effect of duration: who _wouldn't_ more subtly strive for\nthat effect and, intelligently so striving, reach it better, than such\nnon-questioners of fate?--the moral of whose case is surely that if they\ngave up too soon and too softly we wiser witnesses can reverse the\nprocess and fight the whole ground. But I apologise to the heavy shade\nin question if she had really drained her conceivable cup, and for that\nmatter rather like to suppose it, so rich and strange is the pleasure of\nfinding the past--the Past above all--answered for to one's own touch,\nthis being our only way to be sure of it. It was the Past that one\ntouched in her, the American past of a preponderant unthinkable\nqueerness; and great would seem the fortune of helping on the continuity\nat some other far end.\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nIt was at all events the good lady's disappearance that more markedly\ncleared the decks--cleared them for that long, slow, sustained action\nwith which I make out that nothing was afterwards to interfere. She had\nsat there under her stiff old father's portrait, with which her own, on\nthe other side of the chimney, mildly balanced; but these presences\nacted from that time but with cautious reserves. A brave, finished,\nclear-eyed image of such properties as the last-named, in particular,\nour already-mentioned Alexander Robertson, a faint and diminished\nreplica of whose picture (the really fine original, as I remember it,\nhaving been long since perverted from our view) I lately renewed\nacquaintance with in a pious institution of his founding, where, after\nmore than one push northward and some easy accommodations, he lives on\ninto a world that knows him not and of some of the high improvements of\nwhich he can little enough have dreamed. Of the world he had personally\nknown there was a feature or two still extant; the legend of his acres\nand his local concerns, as well as of his solid presence among them, was\nconsiderably cherished by us, though for ourselves personally the\nrelics of his worth were a lean feast to sit at. They were by some\ninvidious turn of fate all to help to constitute the heritage of our\nyoung kinsman, the orphaned and administered _fils de famille_, whose\nfather, Alexander Wyckoff, son of our great-aunt and one of the two\nbrothers of cousin Helen, just discernibly flushes for me through the\nominous haze that preceded the worst visitation of cholera New York was\nto know. Alexander, whom, early widowed and a victim of that visitation,\nI evoke as with something of a premature baldness, of a blackness of\nshort whisker, of an expanse of light waistcoat and of a harmless pomp\nof manner, appeared to have quite predominantly \"come in\" for the values\nin question, which he promptly transmitted to his small motherless son\nand which were destined so greatly to increase. There are clues I have\nonly lost, not making out in the least to-day why the sons of Aunt\nWyckoff should have been so happily distinguished. Our great-uncle of\nthe name isn't even a dim ghost to me--he had passed away beyond recall\nbefore I began to take notice; but I hold, rightly, I feel, that it was\nnot to his person these advantages were attached. They could have\ndescended to our grandmother but in a minor degree--we should otherwise\nhave been more closely aware of them. It comes to me that so far as we\nhad at all been aware it had mostly gone off in smoke: I have still in\nmy ears some rueful allusion to \"lands,\" apparently in the general\ncountry of the Beaverkill, which had come to my mother and her sister as\ntheir share of their grandfather Robertson's amplitude, among the\nfurther-apportioned shares of their four brothers, only to be sacrificed\nlater on at some scant appraisement. It is in the nature of \"lands\" at a\ndistance and in regions imperfectly reclaimed to be spoken of always as\nimmense, and I at any rate entertained the sense that we should have\nbeen great proprietors, in the far wilderness, if we had only taken more\ninterest. Our interests were peculiarly urban--though not indeed that\nthis had helped us much. Something of the mystery of the vanished acres\nhung for me about my maternal uncle, John Walsh, the only one who\nappeared to have been in respect to the dim possessions much on the\nspot, but I too crudely failed of my chance of learning from him what\nhad become of them.\n\nNot that they had seen _him_, poor gentleman, very much further, or that\nI had any strong sense of opportunity; I catch at but two or three\nprojections of him, and only at one of his standing much at his ease: I\nsee him before the fire in the Fourteenth Street library, sturdy, with\nstraight black hair and as if the Beaverkill had rather stamped him, but\nclean-shaven, in a \"stock\" and a black frock-coat--I hear him perhaps\nstill more than I see him deliver himself on the then great subject of\nJenny Lind, whom he seemed to have emerged from the wilderness to listen\nto and as to whom I remember thinking it (strange small critic that I\nmust have begun to be) a note of the wilderness in him that he spoke of\nher as \"Miss Lind\"; albeit I scarce know, and must even less have known\nthen, what other form he could have used. The rest of my sense of him is\ntinged with the ancient pity--that of our so exercised response in those\nyears to the general sad case of uncles, aunts and cousins obscurely\nafflicted (the uncles in particular) and untimely gathered. Sharp to me\nthe memory of a call, one dusky wintry Sunday afternoon, in Clinton\nPlace, at the house of my uncle Robertson Walsh, then the head of my\nmother's family, where the hapless younger brother lay dying; whom I was\ntaken to the top of the house to see and of the sinister twilight\ngrimness of whose lot, stretched there, amid odours of tobacco and of\ndrugs, or of some especial strong drug, in one of the chambers of what I\nremember as a remote and unfriended arching attic, probably in fact the\nbest place of prescribed quiet, I was to carry away a fast impression.\nAll the uncles, of whichever kindred, were to come to seem sooner or\nlater to be dying, more or less before our eyes, of melancholy matters;\nand yet their general story, so far as one could read it, appeared the\nstory of life. I conceived at any rate that John Walsh, celibate, lonely\nand good-naturedly black-browed, had been sacrificed to the far-off\nRobertson acres, which on their side had been sacrificed to I never knew\nwhat. The point of my divagation, however, is that the Barmecide banquet\nof another tract of the same _provenance_ was always spread for us\nopposite the other house, from which point it stretched, on the north\nside of the street, to Sixth Avenue; though here we were soon to see it\ndiminished at the corner by a structure afterwards known to us as our\nprosiest New York school. This edifice, devoted to-day to other uses,\nbut of the same ample insignificance, still left for exploitation at\nthat time an uncovered town-territory the transmitted tale of which was\nthat our greatgrandfather, living down near the Battery, had had his\ncountry villa or, more strictly speaking, his farm there, with free\nexpanses roundabout. Shrunken though the tract a part of it remained--in\nparticular a space that I remember, though with the last faintness, to\nhave seen appeal to the public as a tea-garden or open-air caf\u00c3\u00a9, a haunt\nof dance and song and of other forms of rather ineffective gaiety. The\nsubsequent conversion of the site into the premises of the French\nTheatre I was to be able to note more distinctly; resorting there in the\nwinter of 1874-5, though not without some wan detachment, to a series\nof more or less exotic performances, and admiring in especial the high\nand hard virtuosity of Madame Ristori, the unfailing instinct for the\nwrong emphasis of the then acclaimed Mrs. Rousby (I still hear the\nassured \"Great woman, great woman!\" of a knowing friend met as I went\nout,) and the stout fidelity to a losing game, as well as to a truth not\nquite measurable among us, of the late, the but lugubriously-comic, the\nblighted John Toole.\n\nThese are glimmering ghosts, though that drama of the scene hard by at\nwhich I have glanced gives me back its agents with a finer intensity.\nFor the long action set in, as I have hinted, with the death of Aunt\nWyckoff, and, if rather taking its time at first to develop, maintained\nto the end, which was in its full finality but a few years since, the\nfinest consistency and unity; with cousin Helen, in rich prominence, for\nthe heroine; with the pale adventurous Albert for the hero or young\nprotagonist, a little indeed in the sense of a small New York Orestes\nridden by Furies; with a pair of confidants in the form first of the\nheroine's highly respectable but quite negligible husband and, second,\nof her close friend and quasi-sister our own admirable Aunt; with\nAlexander's younger brother, above all, the odd, the eccentric, the\nattaching Henry, for the stake, as it were, of the game. So for the\nspectator did the figures distribute themselves; the three principal,\non the large stage--it became a field of such spreading interests--well\nin front, and the accessory pair, all sympathy and zeal, prompt comment\nand rich resonance, hovering in the background, responsive to any call\nand on the spot at a sign: this most particularly true indeed of our\nanything but detached Aunt, much less a passive recipient than a vessel\nconstantly brimming, and destined herself to become the outstanding\nagent, almost the _dea ex machina_, in the last act of the story. Her\ncolleague of the earlier periods (though to that title she would scarce\nhave granted his right) I designate rather as our earnest cousin's\nhusband than as our kinsman even by courtesy; since he was \"Mr.\" to his\nown wife, for whom the dread of liberties taken in general included even\nthose that might have been allowed to herself: he had not in the least,\nlike the others in his case, married into the cousinship with us, and\nthis apparently rather by his defect than by ours. His christian name,\nif certainly not for use, was scarce even for ornament--which consorted\nwith the felt limits roundabout him of aids to mention and with the fact\nthat no man could on his journey through life well have been less\neagerly designated or apostrophised. If there are persons as to whom the\n\"Mr.\" never comes up at all, so there are those as to whom it never\nsubsides; but some of them all keep it by the greatness and others,\noddly enough, by the smallness of their importance. The subject of my\npresent reference, as I think of him, nevertheless--by which I mean in\nspite of his place in the latter group--greatly helps my documentation;\nhe must have been of so excellent and consistent a shade of nullity. To\nthat value, if value it be, there almost always attaches some question\nof the degree and the position: with adjuncts, with a relation, the zero\nmay figure as a numeral--and the neglected zero is mostly, for that\nmatter, endowed with a consciousness and subject to irritation. For this\ndim little gentleman, so perfectly a gentleman, no appeal and no\nredress, from the beginning to the end of his career, were made or\nentertained or projected; no question of how to treat him, or of how\n_he_ might see it or feel it, could ever possibly rise; he was blank\nfrom whatever view, remaining so under application of whatever acid or\nexposure to whatever heat; the one identity he could have was to be part\nof the consensus.\n\nSuch a case is rare--that of being no case at all, that of not having\neven the interest of the grievance of not being one: we as a rule catch\nglimpses in the down-trodden of such resentments--they have at least\nsometimes the importance of feeling the weight of our tread. The\nphenomenon was here quite other--that of a natural platitude that had\nnever risen to the level of sensibility. When you have been wronged you\ncan be righted, when you have suffered you can be soothed; if you have\nthat amount of grasp of the \"scene,\" however humble, the drama of your\nlife to some extent enacts itself, with the logical consequence of your\nbeing proportionately its hero and _having_ to be taken for such. Let me\nnot dream of attempting to say for what cousin Helen took her spectral\nspouse, though I think it the most marked touch in her portrait that she\nkept us from ever knowing. She was a person about whom you knew\neverything else, but there she was genially inscrutable, and above all\nclaimed no damages on the score of slights offered him. She knew nothing\nwhatever of these, yet could herself be much wounded or hurt--which\nlatter word she sounded in the wondrous old New York manner so\nirreducible to notation. She covered the whole case with a mantle which\nwas yet much more probably that of her real simplicity than of a feigned\nunconsciousness; I doubt whether she _knew_ that men could be amiable in\na different manner from that which had to serve her for supposing her\nhusband amiable; when the mould and the men cast in it were very\ndifferent she failed, or at least she feared, to conclude to\namiability--though _some_ women (as different themselves as such\nstranger men!) might take it for that. Directly interrogated she might\n(such was the innocence of these long-extinct manners) have approved of\nmale society in stronger doses or more vivid hues--save where\nconsanguinity, or indeed relationship by marriage, to which she greatly\ndeferred, had honestly imposed it. The singular thing for the drama to\nwhich I return was that there it was just consanguinity that had made\nthe burden difficult and strange and of a nature to call on great\ndecisions and patient plans, even though the most ominous possibilities\nwere not involved. I reconstruct and reconstruct of course, but the\nelements had to my childish vision at least nothing at all portentous;\nif any light of the lurid played in for me just a little it was but\nunder much later information. What my childish vision was really most\npossessed of, I think, was the figure of the spectral spouse, the dim\nlittle gentleman, as I have called him, pacing the whole length of the\ntwo big parlours, in prolonged repetition, much as if they had been the\ndeck of one of those ships anciently haunted by him, as \"supercargo\" or\nwhatever, in strange far seas--according to the only legend connected\nwith him save that of his early presumption in having approached, such\nas he was, so fine a young woman, and his remarkable luck in having\napproached her successfully; a luck surprisingly renewed for him, since\nit was also part of the legend that he had previously married and lost a\nbride beyond his deserts.\n\n\n\n\nXI\n\n\nI am, strictly speaking, at this point, on a visit to Albert, who at\ntimes sociably condescended to my fewer years--I still appreciate the\nman-of-the-world ease of it; but my host seems for the minute to have\nleft me, and I am attached but to the rich perspective in which \"Uncle\"\n(for Albert too he was only all namelessly Uncle) comes and goes; out of\nthe comparative high brownness of the back room, commanding brave\nextensions, as I thought them, a covered piazza over which, in season,\nIsabella grapes accessibly clustered and beyond which stretched,\nfurther, a \"yard\" that was as an ample garden compared to ours at home;\nI keep in view his little rounded back, at the base of which his arms\nare interlocked behind him, and I know how his bald head, yet with the\nhair bristling up almost in short-horn fashion at the sides, is thrust\ninquiringly, not to say appealingly, forward; I assist at his emergence,\nwhere the fine old mahogany doors of separation are rolled back on what\nused to seem to me silver wheels, into the brighter yet colder half of\nthe scene, and attend him while he at last looks out awhile into\nFourteenth Street for news of whatever may be remarkably, objectionably\nor mercifully taking place there; and then I await his regular return,\npreparatory to a renewed advance, far from indifferent as I innocently\nam to his discoveries or his comments. It is cousin Helen however who\npreferentially takes them up, attaching to them the right importance,\nwhich is for the moment the very greatest that could possibly be\nattached to anything in the world; I for my part occupied with those\nmarks of character in our pacing companion--his long, slightly equine\ncountenance, his eyebrows ever elevated as in the curiosity of alarm,\nand the so limited play from side to side of his extremely protrusive\nhead, as if somehow through tightness of the \"wash\" neckcloths that he\nhabitually wore and that, wound and re-wound in their successive stages,\nmade his neck very long without making it in the least thick and reached\ntheir climax in a proportionately very small knot tied with the neatest\nart. I scarce can have known at the time that this was as complete a\nlittle old-world figure as any that might then have been noted there,\nfar or near; yet if I didn't somehow \"subtly\" feel it, why am I now so\nconvinced that I must have had familiarly before me a masterpiece of the\ngreat Daumier, say, or Henri Monnier, or any other then contemporary\nprojector of Monsieur Prudhomme, the timorous Philistine in a world of\ndangers, with whom I was later on to make acquaintance? I put myself\nthe question, of scant importance though it may seem; but there is a\nreflection perhaps more timely than any answer to it. I catch myself in\nthe act of seeing poor anonymous \"Dear,\" as cousin Helen confined\nherself, her life long, to calling him, in the light of an image\narrested by the French genius, and this in truth opens up vistas. I\nscarce know what it _doesn't_ suggest for the fact of sharpness, of\nintensity of type; which fact in turn leads my imagination almost any\ndance, making me ask myself quite most of all whether a person so marked\nby it mustn't really have been a highly finished figure.\n\nThat degree of finish was surely rare among us--rare at a time when the\ncharm of so much of the cousinship and the uncleship, the kinship\ngenerally, had to be found in their so engagingly dispensing with any\nfinish at all. They happened to be amiable, to be delightful; but--I\nthink I have already put the question--what would have become of us all\nif they hadn't been? a question the shudder of which could never have\nbeen suggested by the presence I am considering. He too was gentle and\nbland, as it happened--and I indeed see it all as a world quite\nunfavourable to arrogance or insolence or any hard and high assumption;\nbut the more I think of him (even at the risk of thinking too much) the\nmore I make out in him a tone and a manner that deprecated crude ease.\nPlenty of this was already in the air, but if he hadn't so spoken of an\norder in which forms still counted it might scarce have occurred to one\nthat there had ever been any. It comes over me therefore that he\ntestified--and perhaps quite beautifully; I remember his voice and his\nspeech, which were not those of _that_ New York at all, and with the\necho, faint as it is, arrives the wonder of where he could possibly have\npicked such things up. They were, as forms, adjusted and settled things;\nfrom what finer civilisation therefore had they come down to him? To\nbrood on this the least little bit is verily, as I have said, to open up\nvistas--out of the depths of one of which fairly glimmers the queerest\nof questions. Mayn't we accordingly have been, the rest of us, all\nwrong, and the dim little gentleman the only one among us who was right?\nMay not his truth to type have been a matter that, as mostly typeless\nourselves, we neither perceived nor appreciated?--so that if, as is\nconceivable, he felt and measured the situation and simply chose to be\nbland and quiet and keep his sense to himself, he was a hero without the\nlaurel as well as a martyr without the crown. The light of which\npossibility is, however, too fierce; I turn it off, I tear myself from\nthe view--noting further but the one fact in his history that, by my\nglimpse of it, quite escapes ambiguity. The youthful Albert, I have\nmentioned, was to resist successfully through those years that\nsolicitation of \"Europe\" our own response to which, both as a general\nand a particular solution, kept breaking out in choral wails; but the\nother house none the less nourished projects so earnest that they could\ninvoke the dignity of comparative silence and patience. The other house\ndidn't aspire to the tongues, but it aspired to the grand tour, of which\nours was on many grounds incapable. Only after years and when endless\nthings had happened--Albert having long before, in especial, quite taken\nup his stake and ostensibly dropped out of the game--did the great\nadventure get itself enacted, with the effect of one of the liveliest\nillustrations of the irony of fate. What had most of all flushed through\nthe dream of it during years was the legend, at last quite antediluvian,\nof the dim little gentleman's early Wanderjahre, that experience of\ndistant lands and seas which would find an application none the less\nlively for having had long to wait. It had had to wait in truth half a\ncentury, yet its confidence had apparently not been impaired when New\nYork, on the happy day, began to recede from view. Europe had surprises,\nnone the less, and who knows to what extent it may after half a century\nhave had shocks? The coming true of the old dream produced at any rate a\nsnap of the tense cord, and the ancient worthy my imagination has, in\nthe tenderest of intentions, thus played with, disembarked in England\nonly to indulge in the last of his startled stares, only to look about\nhim in vague deprecation and give it all up. He just landed and died;\nbut the grand tour was none the less proceeded with--cousin Helen\nherself, aided by resources personal, social and financial that left\nnothing to desire, triumphantly performed it, though as with a feeling\nof delicacy about it firmly overcome.\n\nBut it has taken me quite out of the other house, so that I patch up\nagain, at a stroke, that early scene of her double guardianship at which\nmy small wonder assisted. It even then glimmered on me, I think, that if\nAlbert was, all so romantically, in charge of his aunt--which was a\nperfectly nondescript relation--so his uncle Henry, her odd brother, was\nher more or less legal ward, not less, despite his being so very much\nAlbert's senior. In these facts and in the character of each of the\nthree persons involved resided the drama; which must more or less have\nbegun, as I have hinted, when simple-minded Henry, at a date I seem to\nhave seized, definitely emerged from rustication--the Beaverkill had but\nfor a certain term protected, or promoted, his simplicity--and began, on\nhis side, to pace the well-worn field between the Fourteenth Street\nwindows and the piazza of the Isabella grapes. I see him there less\nvividly than his fellow-pedestrian only because he was afterwards to\nloom so much larger, whereas his companion, even while still present,\nwas weakly to shrink and fade. At this late day only do I devise for\nthat companion a possible history; the simple-minded Henry's annals on\nthe other hand grew in interest as soon as they became interesting at\nall. This happened as soon as one took in the ground and some of the\nfeatures of his tutelage. The basis of it all was that, harmless as he\nappeared, he was not to be trusted; I remember how portentous that truth\nsoon looked, both in the light of his intense amiability and of sister\nHelen's absolute certitude. He wasn't to be trusted--it was the sole\nvery definite fact about him except the fact that he had so kindly come\ndown from the far-off Beaverkill to regale us with the perfect\ndemonstration, dutifully, resignedly setting himself among us to point\nthe whole moral himself. He appeared, from the moment we really took it\nin, to be doing, in the matter, no more than he ought; he exposed\nhimself to our invidious gaze, on this ground, with a humility, a quiet\ncourtesy and an instinctive dignity that come back to me as simply\nheroic. He had himself accepted, under strenuous suggestion, the\ndreadful view, and I see him to-day, in the light of the grand\nd\u00c3\u00a9nouement, deferred for long years, but fairly dazzling when it came,\nas fairly sublime in his decision not to put anyone in the wrong about\nhim a day sooner than he could possibly help. The whole circle of us\nwould in that event be so dreadfully \"sold,\" as to our wisdom and\njustice, he proving only noble and exquisite. It didn't so immensely\nmatter to him as that, the establishment of his true character didn't;\nso he went on as if for all the years--and they really piled themselves\nup: his passing for a dangerous idiot, or at least for a slave of his\npassions from the moment he was allowed the wherewithal in the least to\nindulge them, was a less evil for him than seeing us rudely corrected.\nIt was in truth an extraordinary situation and would have offered a\nsplendid subject, as we used to say, to the painter of character, the\nnovelist or the dramatist, with the hand to treat it. After I had read\nDavid Copperfield an analogy glimmered--it struck me even in the early\ntime: cousin Henry was more or less another Mr. Dick, just as cousin\nHelen was in her relation to him more or less another Miss Trotwood.\nThere were disparities indeed: Mr. Dick was the harmless lunatic on that\nlady's premises, but she admired him and appealed to him; lunatics, in\nher generous view, might be oracles, and there is no evidence, if I\ncorrectly remember, that she kept him low. Our Mr. Dick was suffered to\nindulge his passions but on ten cents a day, while his fortune, under\nconscientious, under admirable care--cousin Helen being no less the\nwise and keen woman of business than the devoted sister--rolled up and\nbecame large; likewise Miss Trotwood's inmate hadn't at all the\nperplexed brooding brow, with the troubled fold in it, that represented\npoor Henry's only form of criticism of adverse fate. They had alike the\nlarge smooth open countenance of those for whom life has been\nsimplified, and if Mr. Dick had had a fortune he would have remained all\nhis days as modestly vague about the figure of it as our relative\nconsented to remain. The latter's interests were agricultural, while his\npredecessor's, as we remember, were mainly historical; each at any rate\nhad in a general way his Miss Trotwood, not to say his sister Helen.\n\nThe good Henry's Miss Trotwood lived and died without an instant's\nvisitation of doubt as to the due exercise of her authority, as to what\nwould happen if it faltered; her victim waiting in the handsomest manner\ntill she had passed away to show us all--all who remained, after so\nlong, to do him justice--that nothing but what was charming and touching\ncould possibly happen. This was, in part at least, the dazzling\nd\u00c3\u00a9nouement I have spoken of: he became, as soon as fortunate\ndispositions could take effect, the care of our admirable Aunt, between\nwhom and his sister and himself close cousinship, from far back, had\npractically amounted to sisterhood: by which time the other house had\nlong been another house altogether, its ancient site relinquished, its\ncontents planted afresh far northward, with new traditions invoked,\nthough with that of its great friendliness to all of us, for our\nmother's sake, still confirmed. Here with brief brightness, clouded at\nthe very last, the solution emerged; we became aware, not without\nembarrassment, that poor Henry at large and supplied with funds was\nexactly as harmless and blameless as poor Henry stinted and captive; as\nto which if anything had been wanting to our confusion or to his own\ndignity it would have been his supreme abstinence, his suppression of\nthe least \"Didn't I tell you?\" He didn't even pretend to have told us,\nwhen he so abundantly might, and nothing could exceed the grace with\nwhich he appeared to have noticed nothing. He \"handled\" dollars as\ndecently, and just as profusely, as he had handled dimes; the only light\nshade on the scene--except of course for its being so belated, which did\nmake it pathetically dim--was the question of how nearly he at all\nmeasured his resources. Not his heart, but his imagination, in the long\nyears, had been starved; and though he was now all discreetly and wisely\nencouraged to feel rich, it was rather sadly visible that, thanks to\nalmost half a century of over-discipline, he failed quite to rise to his\nestate. He did feel rich, just as he felt generous; the misfortune was\nonly in his weak sense for meanings. That, with the whole situation,\nmade delicacy of the first importance; as indeed what was perhaps most\nstriking in the entire connection was the part played by delicacy from\nthe first. It had all been a drama of the delicate: the consummately\nscrupulous and successful administration of his resources for the\nbenefit of his virtue, so that they could be handed over, in the event,\nwithout the leakage of a fraction, what was that but a triumph of\ndelicacy? So delicacy conspired, delicacy surrounded him; the case\nhaving been from the early time that, could he only be regarded as\nsufficiently responsible, could the sources of his bounty be judged\nfairly open to light pressure (there was question of none but the\nlightest) that bounty might blessedly flow. This had been Miss\nTrotwood's own enlightened view, on behalf of one of the oddest and most\nappealing collections of wistful wondering single gentlewomen that a\ngreat calculating benevolence perhaps ever found arrayed before\nit--ornaments these all of the second and third cousinship and\ninterested spectators of the almost inexpressible facts.\n\nI should have liked completely to express them, in spite of the\ndifficulty--if not indeed just by reason of that; the difficulty of\ntheir consisting so much more of \"character\" than of \"incident\" (heaven\nsave the artless opposition!) though this last element figured bravely\nenough too, thanks to some of the forms taken by our young Albert's wild\nwilfulness. He was so weak--after the most approved fashion of\ndistressing young men of means--that his successive exhibitions of it\nhad a fine high positive effect, such as would have served beautifully,\nact after act, for the descent of the curtain. The issue, however\n(differing in this from the common theatrical trick) depended less on\nwho should die than on who should live; the younger of cousin Helen's\npair of wards--putting them even only as vessels of her attempted\nearnestness--had violently broken away, but a remedy to this grief, for\nreasons too many to tell, dwelt in the possible duration, could it only\nnot be arrested, of two other lives, one of these her own, the second\nthe guileless Henry's. The single gentlewomen, to a remarkable number,\nwhom she regarded and treated as nieces, though they were only daughters\nof cousins, were such objects of her tender solicitude that, she and\nHenry and Albert being alike childless, the delightful thing to think of\nwas, on certain contingencies, the nieces' prospective wealth. There\nwere contingencies of course--and they exactly produced the pity and\nterror. Her estate would go at her death to her nearest of kin,\nrepresented by her brother and nephew; it would be only of her\nsavings--fortunately, with her kind eye on the gentlewomen, zealous and\nlong continued--that she might dispose by will; and it was but a\ntroubled comfort that, should he be living at the time of her death, the\nsusceptible Henry would profit no less than the wanton Albert. Henry was\nat any cost to be kept in life that he _might_ profit; the woeful\nquestion, the question of delicacy, for a woman devoutly conscientious,\nwas how could anyone else, how, above all, could fifteen other persons,\nbe made to profit by his profiting? She had been as earnest a steward of\nher brother's fortune as if directness of pressure on him, in a sense\nfavourable to her interests--that is to her sympathies, which were her\nonly interests--had been a matter of course with her; whereas in fact\nshe would have held it a crime, given his simplicity, to attempt in the\nleast to guide his hand. If he didn't outlive his nephew--and he was\nolder, though, as would appear, so much more virtuous--his inherited\nproperty, she being dead, would accrue to that unedifying person.\n_There_ was the pity; and as for the question of the disposition of\nHenry's savings without the initiative of Henry's intelligence, in that,\nalas, was the terror. Henry's savings--there had been no terror for her,\nnaturally, in beautifully husbanding his resources _for_ him--dangled,\nnaturally, with no small vividness, before the wistful gentlewomen, to\nwhom, if he had but _had_ the initiative, he might have made the most\nprincely presents. Such was the oddity, not to say the rather tragic\ndrollery, of the situation: that Henry's idea of a present was ten\ncents' worth of popcorn, or some similar homely trifle; and that when\none had created for him a world of these proportions there was no honest\nway of inspiring him to write cheques for hundreds; all congruous though\nthese would be with the generosity of his nature as shown by the\nexuberance of his popcorn. The ideal solution would be his flashing to\nintelligence just long enough to apprehend the case and, of his own\nmagnanimous movement, sign away everything; but that was a fairy-tale\nstroke, and the fairies here somehow stood off.\n\nThus between the wealth of her earnestness and the poverty of her\ncourage--her dread, that is, of exposing herself to a legal process for\nundue influence--our good lady was not at peace; or, to be exact, was\nonly at such peace as came to her by the free bestowal of her own\naccumulations during her lifetime and after her death. She predeceased\nher brother and had the pang of feeling that if half her residuum would\nbe deplorably diverted the other half would be, by the same stroke,\nimperfectly applied; the artless Henry remained at once so well provided\nand so dimly inspired. Here was suspense indeed for a last \"curtain\" but\none; and my fancy glows, all expertly, for the disclosure of the final\nscene, than which nothing could well have been happier, on all the\npremises, save for a single flaw: the installation in Forty-fourth\nStreet of our admirable aunt, often, through the later years, domiciled\nthere, but now settled to community of life with a touching charge and\nrepresenting near him his extinguished, _their_ extinguished, sister.\nThe too few years that followed were the good man's Indian summer and a\nvery wonderful time--so charmingly it shone forth, for all concerned,\nthat he was a person fitted to adorn, as the phrase is, almost any\nposition. Our admirable aunt, not less devoted and less disinterested\nthan his former protectress, had yet much more imagination; she had\nenough, in a word, for perfect confidence, and under confidence what\nremained of poor Henry's life bloomed like a garden freshly watered. Sad\nalas the fact that so scant a patch was now left. It sufficed, however,\nand he rose, just in time, to every conception; it was, as I have\nalready noted, as if he had all the while known, as if he had really\nbeen a conscious victim to the superstition of his blackness. His final\ncompanion recognised, as it were, his powers; and it may be imagined\nwhether when he absolutely himself proposed to benefit the gentlewomen\nshe passed him, or not, the blessed pen. He had taken a year or two to\npublish by his behaviour the perfection of his civility, and so, on that\nsafe ground, made use of the pen. His competence was afterwards\nattacked, and it emerged triumphant, exactly as his perfect charity and\nhumility and amenity, and his long inward loneliness, of half a century,\ndid. He had bowed his head and sometimes softly scratched it during that\nimmense period; he had occasionally, after roaming downstairs with the\ntroubled fold in his brow and the difficult, the smothered statement on\nhis lips (his vocabulary was scant and stiff, the vocabulary of pleading\nexplanation, often found too complicated by the witty,) retired once\nmore to his room sometimes indeed for hours, to think it all over again;\nbut had never failed of sobriety or propriety or punctuality or\nregularity, never failed of one of the virtues his imputed indifference\nto which had been the ground of his discipline. It was very\nextraordinary, and of all the stories I know is I think the most\nbeautiful--so far at least as _he_ was concerned! The flaw I have\nmentioned, the one break in the final harmony, was the death of our\nadmirable aunt too soon, shortly before his own and while, taken with\nillness at the same time, he lay there deprived of her attention. He had\nthat of the gentlewomen, however, two or three of the wisest and\ntenderest being deputed by the others; and if his original estate\nreverted at law they presently none the less had occasion to bless his\nname.\n\n\n\n\nXII\n\n\nI turn round again to where I last left myself gaping at the old\nricketty bill-board in Fifth Avenue; and am almost as sharply aware as\never of the main source of its spell, the fact that it most often blazed\nwith the rich appeal of Mr. Barnum, whose \"lecture-room,\" attached to\nthe Great American Museum, overflowed into posters of all the theatrical\nbravery disavowed by its title. It was my rueful theory of those\ndays--though tasteful I may call it too as well as rueful--that on all\nthe holidays on which we weren't dragged to the dentist's we attended as\na matter of course at Barnum's, that is when we were so happy as to be\nable to; which, to my own particular consciousness, wasn't every time\nthe case. The case was too often, to my melancholy view, that W. J.,\nquite regularly, on the non-dental Saturdays, repaired to this seat of\njoy with the easy Albert--_he_ at home there and master of the scene to\na degree at which, somehow, neither of us could at the best arrive; he\nquite moulded, truly, in those years of plasticity, as to the \u00c3\u00a6sthetic\nbent and the determination of curiosity, I seem to make out, by the\ngeneral Barnum association and revelation. It was not, I hasten to add,\nthat I too didn't, to the extent of my minor chance, drink at the\nspring; for how else should I have come by the whole undimmed sense of\nthe connection?--the weary waiting, in the dusty halls of humbug, amid\nbottled mermaids, \"bearded ladies\" and chill dioramas, for the\nlecture-room, the true centre of the seat of joy, to open: vivid in\nespecial to me is my almost sick wondering of whether I mightn't be rapt\naway before it did open. The impression appears to have been mixed; the\ndrinking deep and the holding out, holding out in particular against\nfailure of food and of stage-fares, provision for transport to and fro,\nbeing questions equally intense: the appeal of the lecture-room, in its\nessence a heavy extra, so exhausted our resources that even the\nsustaining doughnut of the refreshment-counter would mock our desire and\nthe long homeward crawl, the length of Broadway and further, seem to\ndefy repetition. Those desperate days, none the less, affect me now as\nhaving flushed with the very complexion of romance; their aches and\ninanitions were part of the adventure; the homeward straggle,\ninterminable as it appeared, flowered at moments into rapt\ncontemplations--that for instance of the painted portrait, large as\nlife, of the celebrity of the hour, then \"dancing\" at the Broadway\nTheatre, Lola Montes, Countess of Lansfeldt, of a dazzling and unreal\nbeauty and in a riding-habit lavishly open at the throat.\n\nIt was thus quite in order that I should pore longest, there at my\nfondest corner, over the Barnum announcements--my present inability to\nbe superficial about which has given in fact the measure of my\ncontemporary care. These announcements must have been in their way\nmarvels of attractive composition, the placard bristling from top to toe\nwith its analytic \"synopsis of scenery and incidents\"; the synoptical\nview cast its net of fine meshes and the very word savoured of\nincantation. It is odd at the same time that when I question memory as\nto the living hours themselves, those of the stuffed and dim little hall\nof audience, smelling of peppermint and orange-peel, where the curtain\nrose on our gasping but rewarded patience, two performances only stand\nout for me, though these in the highest relief. Love, or the Countess\nand the Serf, by J. Sheridan Knowles--I see that still as the blazonry\nof one of them, just as I see Miss Emily Mestayer, large, red in the\nface, coifed in a tangle of small, fine, damp-looking short curls and\nclad in a light-blue garment edged with swans-down, shout at the top of\nher lungs that a \"pur-r-r-se of gold\" would be the fair guerdon of the\nminion who should start on the spot to do her bidding at some desperate\ncrisis that I forget. I forget Huon the serf, whom I yet recall\nimmensely admiring for his nobleness; I forget everyone but Miss\nMestayer, who gave form to my conception of the tragic actress at her\nhighest. She had a hooked nose, a great play of nostril, a vast\nprotuberance of bosom and always the \"crop\" of close moist ringlets; I\nsay always, for I was to see her often again, during a much later phase,\nthe mid-most years of that Boston Museum which aimed at so vastly higher\na distinction than the exploded lecture-room had really done, though in\nan age that snickered even abnormally low it still lacked the courage to\ncall itself a theatre. She must have been in comedy, which I believe she\nalso usefully and fearlessly practised, rather unimaginable; but there\nwas no one like her in the Boston time for cursing queens and\neagle-beaked mothers; the Shakespeare of the Booths and other such would\nhave been unproducible without her; she had a rusty, rasping, heaving\nand tossing \"authority\" of which the bitterness is still in my ears. I\nam revisited by an outer glimpse of her in that after age when she had\ncome, comparatively speaking, into her own--the sight of her,\naccidentally incurred, one tremendously hot summer night, as she slowly\nmoved from her lodgings or wherever, in the high Bowdoin Street region,\ndown to the not distant theatre from which even the temperature had\ngiven her no reprieve; and well remember how, the queer light of my\nyoung impression playing up again in her path, she struck me as the\nvery image of mere sore histrionic habit and use, a worn and weary, a\nbattered even though almost sordidly smoothed, _thing_ of the theatre,\nvery much as an old infinitely-handled and greasy violoncello of the\norchestra might have been. It was but an effect doubtless of the heat\nthat she scarcely seemed clad at all; slippered, shuffling and, though\nsomehow hatted and vaguely veiled or streamered, wrapt in a gauzy sketch\nof a dressing-gown, she pointed to my extravagant attention the moral of\nthankless personal service, of the reverse of the picture, of the cost\nof \"amusing the public\" in a case of amusing it, as who should say,\nevery hour. And I had thrilled before her as the Countess in\n\"Love\"--such contrasted combinations! But she carried her head very\nhigh, as with the habit of crowns and trains and tirades--had in fact\nmuch the air of some deposed and reduced sovereign living on a scant\nallowance; so that, all invisibly and compassionately, I took off my hat\nto her.\n\nTo which I must add the other of my two Barnumite scenic memories, my\nhaving anciently admired her as the Eliza of Uncle Tom's Cabin, her\nswelling bust encased in a neat cotton gown and her flight across the\nice-blocks of the Ohio, if I rightly remember the perilous stream,\nintrepidly and gracefully performed. We lived and moved at that time,\nwith great intensity, in Mrs. Stowe's novel--which, recalling my prompt\nand charmed acquaintance with it, I should perhaps substitute for The\nInitials, earlier mentioned here, as my first experiment in grown-up\nfiction. There was, however, I think, for that triumphant work no\nclassified condition; it was for no sort of reader as distinct from any\nother sort, save indeed for Northern as differing from Southern: it knew\nthe large felicity of gathering in alike the small and the simple and\nthe big and the wise, and had above all the extraordinary fortune of\nfinding itself, for an immense number of people, much less a book than a\nstate of vision, of feeling and of consciousness, in which they didn't\nsit and read and appraise and pass the time, but walked and talked and\nlaughed and cried and, in a manner of which Mrs. Stowe was the\nirresistible cause, generally conducted themselves. Appreciation and\njudgment, the whole impression, were thus an effect for which there had\nbeen no process--any process so related having in other cases _had_ to\nbe at some point or other critical; nothing in the guise of a written\nbook, therefore, a book printed, published, sold, bought and \"noticed,\"\nprobably ever reached its mark, the mark of exciting interest, without\nhaving at least groped for that goal _as_ a book or by the exposure of\nsome literary side. Letters, here, languished unconscious, and Uncle\nTom, instead of making even one of the cheap short cuts through the\nmedium in which books breathe, even as fishes in water, went gaily\nroundabout it altogether, as if a fish, a wonderful \"leaping\" fish, had\nsimply flown through the air. This feat accomplished, the surprising\ncreature could naturally fly anywhere, and one of the first things it\ndid was thus to flutter down on every stage, literally without\nexception, in America and Europe. If the amount of life represented in\nsuch a work is measurable by the ease with which representation is taken\nup and carried further, carried even violently furthest, the fate of\nMrs. Stowe's picture was conclusive: it simply sat down wherever it\nlighted and made itself, so to speak, at home; thither multitudes\nflocked afresh and there, in each case, it rose to its height again and\nwent, with all its vivacity and good faith, through all its motions.\n\nThese latter were to leave me, however, with a fonder vision still than\nthat of the comparatively jejune \"lecture-room\" version; for the first\nexhibition of them to spring to the front was the fine free rendering\nachieved at a playhouse till then ignored by fashion and culture, the\nNational Theatre, deep down on the East side, whence echoes had come\nfaintest to ears polite, but where a sincerity vivid though rude was now\nsupposed to reward the curious. Our numerous attendance there under this\nspell was my first experience of the \"theatre party\" as we have enjoyed\nit in our time--each emotion and impression of which is as fresh to me\nas the most recent of the same family. Precious through all indeed\nperhaps is the sense, strange only to later sophistication, of my small\nencouraged state as a free playgoer--a state doubly wondrous while I\nthus evoke the full contingent from Union Square; where, for that\nmatter, I think, the wild evening must have been planned. I am lost\nagain in all the goodnature from which small boys, on wild evenings,\ncould dangle so unchidden--since the state of unchiddenness is what\ncomes back to me well-nigh clearest. How without that complacency of\nconscience could every felt impression so live again? It is true that\nfor my present sense of the matter snubs and raps would still tingle,\nwould count double; just wherefore it is exactly, however, that I mirror\nmyself in these depths of propriety. The social scheme, as we knew it,\nwas, in its careless charity, worthy of the golden age--though I can't\nsufficiently repeat that we knew it both at its easiest and its safest:\nthe fruits dropped right upon the board to which we flocked together,\nthe least of us and the greatest, with differences of appetite and of\nreach, doubtless, but not with differences of place and of proportionate\nshare. My appetite and my reach in respect to the more full-bodied Uncle\nTom might have brooked certainly any comparison; I must have partaken\nthoroughly of the feast to have left the various aftertastes so separate\nand so strong. It was a great thing to have a canon to judge by--it\nhelped conscious criticism, which was to fit on wings (for use ever\nafter) to the shoulders of appreciation. In the light of that advantage\nI could be _sure_ my second Eliza was less dramatic than my first, and\nthat my first \"Cassy,\" that of the great and blood-curdling Mrs. Bellamy\nof the lecture-room, touched depths which made the lady at the National\nprosaic and placid (I could already be \"down\" on a placid Cassy;) just\nas on the other hand the rocking of the ice-floes of the Ohio, with the\ndesperate Eliza, infant in arms, balancing for a leap from one to the\nother, had here less of the audible creak of carpentry, emulated a\ntrifle more, to my perception, the real water of Mr. Crummles's pump.\nThey can't, even at that, have emulated it much, and one almost envies\n(quite making up one's mind not to denounce) the simple faith of an age\nbeguiled by arts so rude.\n\nHowever, the point exactly was that we attended this spectacle just in\norder _not_ to be beguiled, just in order to enjoy with ironic\ndetachment and, at the very most, to be amused ourselves at our\nsensibility should it prove to have been trapped and caught. To have\nbecome thus aware of our collective attitude constituted for one small\nspectator at least a great initiation; he got his first glimpse of that\npossibility of a \"free play of mind\" over a subject which was to throw\nhim with force at a later stage of culture, when subjects had\nconsiderably multiplied, into the critical arms of Matthew Arnold. So he\nis himself at least interested in seeing the matter--as a progress in\nwhich the first step was taken, before that crude scenic appeal, by his\nwondering, among his companions, where the absurd, the absurd for\n_them_, ended and the fun, the real fun, which was the gravity, the\ntragedy, the drollery, the beauty, the thing itself, briefly, might be\nlegitimately and tastefully held to begin. Uncanny though the remark\nperhaps, I am not sure I wasn't thus more interested in the pulse of our\nparty, under my tiny recording thumb, than in the beat of the drama and\nthe shock of its opposed forces--vivid and touching as the contrast was\nthen found for instance between the tragi-comical Topsy, the slave-girl\nclad in a pinafore of sackcloth and destined to become for Anglo-Saxon\nmillions the type of the absolute in the artless, and her little\nmistress the blonde Eva, a figure rather in the Kenwigs tradition of\npantalettes and pigtails, whom I recall as perching quite suicidally,\nwith her elbows out and a preliminary shriek, on that bulwark of the\nMississippi steamboat which was to facilitate her all but fatal\nimmersion in the flood. Why should I have duly noted that no little\ngame on her part could well less have resembled or simulated an\naccident, and yet have been no less moved by her reappearance, rescued\nfrom the river but perfectly dry, in the arms of faithful Tom, who had\nplunged in to save her, without either so much as wetting his shoes,\nthan if I had been engaged with her in a reckless romp? I could count\nthe white stitches in the loose patchwork, and yet could take it for a\nstory rich and harmonious; I could know we had all intellectually\ncondescended and that we had yet had the thrill of an \u00c3\u00a6sthetic\nadventure; and this was a brave beginning for a consciousness that was\nto be nothing if not mixed and a curiosity that was to be nothing if not\nrestless.\n\nThe principle of this prolonged arrest, which I insist on prolonging a\nlittle further, is doubtless in my instinct to grope for our earliest\n\u00c3\u00a6sthetic seeds. Careless at once and generous the hands by which they\nwere sown, but practically appointed none the less to cause that\npeculiarly flurried hare to run--flurried because over ground so little\nnative to it--when so many others held back. Is it _that_ air of romance\nthat gilds for me then the Barnum background--taking it as a symbol;\nthat makes me resist, to this effect of a passionate adverse loyalty,\nany impulse to translate into harsh terms any old sordidities and\npoverties? The Great American Museum, the down-town scenery and aspects\nat large, and even the up-town improvements on them, as then\nflourishing?--why, they must have been for the most part of the last\nmeanness: the Barnum picture above all ignoble and awful, its blatant\nface or frame stuck about with innumerable flags that waved, poor\nvulgar-sized ensigns, over spurious relics and catchpenny monsters in\neffigy, to say nothing of the promise within of the still more monstrous\nand abnormal living--from the total impression of which things we\nplucked somehow the flower of the ideal. It grew, I must in justice\nproceed, much more sweetly and naturally at Niblo's, which represented\nin our scheme the ideal evening, while Barnum figured the ideal day; so\nthat I ask myself, with that sense of our resorting there under the rich\ncover of night (which was the supreme charm,) how it comes that this\nlarger memory hasn't swallowed up all others. For here, absolutely,\n_was_ the flower at its finest and grown as nowhere else--grown in the\ngreat garden of the Ravel Family and offered again and again to our deep\ninhalation. I see the Ravels, French acrobats, dancers and pantomimists,\nas representing, for our culture, pure grace and charm and civility; so\nthat one doubts whether any candid community was ever so much in debt to\na race of entertainers or had so happy and prolonged, so personal and\ngrateful a relation with them. They must have been, with their\noffshoots of Martinettis and others, of three or four generations,\nbesides being of a rich theatrical stock generally, and we had our\nparticular friends and favourites among them; we seemed to follow them\nthrough every phase of their career, to assist at their tottering steps\nalong the tight-rope as very small children kept in equilibrium by very\nbig balancing-poles (caretakers here walking under in case of falls;) to\ngreet them as Madame Axel, of robust maturity and in a Spanish costume,\nbounding on the same tense cord more heavily but more assuredly; and\nfinally to know the climax of the art with them in Raoul or the\nNight-Owl and Jocko or the Brazilian Ape--and all this in the course of\nour own brief infancy. My impression of them bristles so with memories\nthat we seem to have rallied to their different productions with much\nthe same regularity with which we formed fresh educational connections;\nand they were so much our property and our pride that they supported us\nhandsomely through all fluttered entertainment of the occasional Albany\ncousins. I remember how when one of these visitors, wound up, in honour\nof New York, to the very fever of perception, broke out one evening\nwhile we waited for the curtain to rise, \"Oh don't you hear the cries?\nThey're _beating_ them, I'm sure they are; can't it be stopped?\" we\nresented the charge as a slur on our very honour; for what our romantic\nrelative had heatedly imagined to reach us, in a hushed-up manner from\nbehind, was the sounds attendant on the application of blows to some\nacrobatic infant who had \"funked\" his little job. Impossible such\nhorrors in the world of pure poetry opened out to us at Niblo's, a\ntemple of illusion, of tragedy and comedy and pathos that, though its\n_abords_ of stony brown Metropolitan Hotel, on the \"wrong side,\" must\nhave been bleak and vulgar, flung its glamour forth into Broadway. What\nmore pathetic for instance, so that we publicly wept, than the fate of\nwondrous Martinetti Jocko, who, after befriending a hapless French\nfamily wrecked on the coast of Brazil and bringing back to life a small\nboy rescued from the waves (I see even now, with every detail, this\ninanimate victim supine on the strand) met his death by some cruel\nbullet of which I have forgotten the determinant cause, only remembering\nthe final agony as something we could scarce bear and a strain of our\nsensibility to which our parents repeatedly questioned the wisdom of\nexposing us.\n\nThese performers and these things were in all probability but of a\nmiddling skill and splendour--it was the pre-trap\u00c3\u00a8ze age, and we were\ncaught by mild marvels, even if a friendly good faith in them, something\nsweet and sympathetic, was after all a value, whether of their own\nhumanity, their own special quality, or only of our innocence, never to\nbe renewed; but I light this taper to the initiators, so to call them,\nwhom I remembered, when we had left them behind, as if they had given us\na silver key to carry off and so to refit, after long years, to sweet\nnames never thought of from then till now. Signor L\u00c3\u00a9on Javelli, in whom\nthe French and the Italian charm appear to have met, who was he, and\nwhat did he brilliantly do, and why of a sudden do I thus recall and\nadmire him? I am afraid he but danced the tight-rope, the most domestic\nof our friends' resources, as it brought them out, by the far stretch of\nthe rope, into the bosom of the house and against our very hearts, where\nthey leapt and bounded and wavered and recovered closely face to face\nwith us; but I dare say he bounded, brave Signor L\u00c3\u00a9on, to the greatest\nheight of all: let this vague agility, in any case, connect him with\nthat revelation of the ballet, the sentimental-pastoral, of other years,\nwhich, in The Four Lovers for example, a pantomimic lesson as in words\nof one syllable, but all quick and gay and droll, would have affected us\nas classic, I am sure, had we then had at our disposal that term of\nappreciation. When we read in English story-books about the pantomimes\nin London, which somehow cropped up in them so often, those were the\nonly things that didn't make us yearn; so much we felt we were masters\nof the type, and so almost sufficiently was that a stop-gap for London\nconstantly deferred. We hadn't the transformation-scene, it was true,\nthough what this really seemed to come to was clown and harlequin taking\nliberties with policemen--these last evidently a sharp note in a\npicturesqueness that we lacked, our own slouchy \"officers\" saying\nnothing to us of that sort; but we had at Niblo's harlequin and\ncolumbine, albeit of less pure a tradition, and we knew moreover all\nabout clowns, for we went to circuses too, and so repeatedly that when I\nadd them to our list of recreations, the good old orthodox circuses\nunder tents set up in vacant lots, with which New York appears at that\ntime to have bristled, time and place would seem to have shrunken for\nmost other pursuits, and not least for that of serious learning. And the\ncase is aggravated as I remember Franconi's, which we more or less\nhaunted and which, aiming at the grander style and the monumental\neffect, blazed with fresh paint and rang with Roman chariot-races up\nthere among the deserts of Twenty-ninth Street or wherever; considerably\nsouth, perhaps, but only a little east, of the vaster desolations that\ngave scope to the Crystal Palace, second of its name since,\nfollowing--not _passibus \u00c3\u00a6quis_, alas--the London structure of 1851,\nthis enterprise forestalled by a year or two the Paris Palais de\nl'Industrie of 1855. Such as it was I feel again its majesty on those\noccasions on which I dragged--if I must here once more speak for myself\nonly--after Albany cousins through its courts of edification: I remember\nbeing very tired and cold and hungry there, in a little light drab and\nvery glossy or shiny \"talma\" breasted with rather troublesome\nbuttonhole-embroideries; though concomitantly conscious that I was\nsomehow in Europe, since everything about me had been \"brought over,\"\nwhich ought to have been consoling, and seems in fact to have been so in\nsome degree, inasmuch as both my own pain and the sense of the cousinly,\nthe Albany, headaches quite fade in that recovered presence of big\nEuropean Art embodied in Thorwaldsen's enormous Christ and the\nDisciples, a shining marble company ranged in a semicircle of dark\nmaroon walls. If this was Europe then Europe was beautiful indeed, and\nwe rose to it on the wings of wonder; never were we afterwards to see\ngreat showy sculpture, in whatever profuse exhibition or of whatever\nperiod or school, without some renewal of that charmed Thorwaldsen hour,\nsome taste again of the almost sugary or confectionery sweetness with\nwhich the great white images had affected us under their supper-table\ngaslight. The Crystal Palace was vast and various and dense, which was\nwhat Europe was going to be; it was a deep-down jungle of impressions\nthat were somehow challenges, even as we might, helplessly defied, find\nforeign words and practices; over which formidably towered Kiss's\nmounted Amazon attacked by a leopard or whatever, a work judged at that\nday sublime and the glory of the place; so that I felt the journey back\nin the autumn dusk and the Sixth Avenue cars (established just in time)\na relapse into soothing flatness, a return to the Fourteenth Street\nhorizon from a far journey and a hundred looming questions that would\nstill, tremendous thought, come up for all the personal answers of which\none cultivated the seed.\n\n\n\n\nXIII\n\n\nLet me hurry, however, to catch again that thread I left dangling from\nmy glance at our small vague spasms of school--my personal sense of them\nbeing as vague and small, I mean, in contrast with the fuller and\nstronger cup meted out all round to the Albany cousins, much more\nprivileged, I felt, in every stroke of fortune; or at least much more\ninteresting, though it might be wicked to call them more happy, through\nthose numberless bereavements that had so enriched their existence. I\nmentioned above in particular the enviable consciousness of our little\nred-headed kinsman Gus Barker, who, as by a sharp prevision, snatched\nwhat gaiety he might from a life to be cut short, in a cavalry dash, by\none of the Confederate bullets of 1863: he blew out at us, on New York\nSundays, as I have said, sharp puffs of the atmosphere of the\nInstitution Charlier--strong to us, that is, the atmosphere of whose\ninstitutions was weak; but it was above all during a gregarious visit\npaid him in a livelier field still that I knew myself merely mother'd\nand brother'd. It had been his fate to be but scantly the latter and\nnever at all the former--our aunt Janet had not survived his birth; but\non this day of our collective pilgrimage to Sing-Sing, where he was at a\n\"military\" school and clad in a fashion that represented to me the very\npanoply of war, he shone with a rare radiance of privation. Ingenuous\nand responsive, of a social disposition, a candour of gaiety, that\nmatched his physical activity--the most beautifully made athletic little\nperson, and in the highest degree appealing and engaging--he not only\ndid us the honours of his dazzling academy (dazzling at least to me) but\nhad all the air of showing us over the great State prison which even\nthen flourished near at hand and to which he accompanied us; a party of\na composition that comes back to me as wonderful, the New York and\nAlbany cousinships appearing to have converged and met, for the happy\noccasion, with the generations and sexes melting together and moving in\na loose harmonious band. The party must have been less numerous than by\nthe romantic tradition or confused notation of my youth, and what I\nmainly remember of it beyond my sense of our being at once an attendant\ntrain to my aged and gentle and in general most unadventurous\ngrandmother, and a chorus of curiosity and amusement roundabout the\nvivid Gussy, is our collective impression that State prisons were on the\nwhole delightful places, vast, bright and breezy, with a gay, free\ncirculation in corridors and on stairs, a pleasant prevalence of hot\nsoup and fresh crusty rolls, in tins, of which visitors admiringly\npartook, and for the latter, in chance corners and on sunny landings,\nmuch interesting light brush of gentlemen remarkable but for gentlemanly\ncrimes--that is defalcations and malversations to striking and\nimpressive amounts.\n\nI recall our coming on such a figure at the foot of a staircase and his\nhaving been announced to us by our conductor or friend in charge as\nlikely to be there; and what a charm I found in his cool loose uniform\nof shining white (as I was afterwards to figure it,) as well as in his\ngenerally refined and distinguished appearance and in the fact that he\nwas engaged, while exposed to our attention, in the commendable act of\nparing his nails with a smart penknife and that he didn't allow us to\ninterrupt him. One of my companions, I forget which, had advised me that\nin these contacts with illustrious misfortune I was to be careful not to\nstare; and present to me at this moment is the wonder of whether he\nwould think it staring to note that _he_ quite stared, and also that his\nhands were fine and fair and one of them adorned with a signet ring. I\nwas to have later in life a glimpse of two or three dismal\npenitentiaries, places affecting me as sordid, as dark and dreadful; but\nif the revelation of Sing-Sing had involved the idea of a timely warning\nto the young mind my small sensibility at least was not reached by the\nlesson. I envied the bold-eyed celebrity in the array of a planter at\nhis ease--we might have been _his_ slaves--quite as much as I envied\nGussy; in connection with which I may remark here that though in that\nearly time I seem to have been constantly eager to exchange my lot for\nthat of somebody else, on the assumed certainty of gaining by the\nbargain, I fail to remember feeling jealous of such happier persons--in\nthe measure open to children of spirit. I had rather a positive lack of\nthe passion, and thereby, I suppose, a lack of spirit; since if jealousy\nbears, as I think, on what one sees one's companions able to do--as\nagainst one's own falling short--envy, as I knew it at least, was simply\nof what they _were_, or in other words of a certain sort of richer\nconsciousness supposed, doubtless often too freely supposed, in them.\nThey were so _other_--that was what I felt; and to _be_ other, other\nalmost anyhow, seemed as good as the probable taste of the bright\ncompound wistfully watched in the confectioner's window; unattainable,\nimpossible, of course, but as to which just this impossibility and just\nthat privation kept those active proceedings in which jealousy seeks\nrelief quite out of the question. A platitude of acceptance of the poor\nactual, the absence of all vision of how in any degree to change it,\ncombined with a complacency, an acuity of perception of alternatives,\nthough a view of them as only through the confectioner's hard\nglass--that is what I recover as the nearest approach to an apology, in\nthe soil of my nature, for the springing seed of emulation. I never\ndreamed of competing--a business having in it at the best, for my\ntemper, if not for my total failure of temper, a displeasing ferocity.\nIf competing was bad snatching was therefore still worse, and jealousy\nwas a sort of spiritual snatching. With which, nevertheless, all the\nwhile, one might have been \"like\" So-and-So, who had such horizons. A\nhelpless little love of horizons I certainly cherished, and could\nsometimes even care for my own. These always shrank, however, under\nalmost any suggestion of a further range or finer shade in the purple\nrim offered to other eyes--and that is what I take for the restlessness\nof envy. It wasn't that I wished to change with everyone, with anyone at\na venture, but that I saw \"gifts\" everywhere but as mine and that I\nscarce know whether to call the effect of this miserable or monstrous.\nIt was the effect at least of self-abandonment--I mean to visions.\n\nThere must have been on that occasion of the Sing-Sing day--which it\ndeeply interests me to piece together--some state of connection for some\nof us with the hospitalities of Rhinebeck, the place of abode of the\neldest of the Albany uncles--that is of the three most in our view; for\nthere were two others, the eldest of all a half-uncle only, who formed a\nclass quite by himself, and the very youngest, who, with lively\ninterests of his own, had still less attention for us than either of his\nthree brothers. The house at Rhinebeck and all its accessories (which\nstruck our young sense as innumerable,) in especial the great bluff of\nthe Hudson on which it stood, yields me images scarcely dimmed, though\nas the effect but of snatches of acquaintance; there at all events the\ngently-groaning--ever so gently and dryly--Albany grandmother, with the\nAlbany cousins as to whom I here discriminate, her two adopted\ndaughters, maturest and mildest of the general tribe, must have paused\nfor a stay; a feature of which would be perhaps her juncture with the\nNew York contingent, somewhere sociably achieved, for the befriending of\njuvenile Gussy. It shimmers there, the whole circumstance, with I scarce\nknow what large innocence of charity and ease; the Gussy-pretext, for\nreunion, all so thin yet so important an appeal, the simplicity of the\ninterests and the doings, the assumptions and the concessions, each\nto-day so touching, almost so edifying. We were surely all gentle and\ngenerous together, floating in such a clean light social order, sweetly\nproof against ennui--unless it be a bad note, as is conceivable, never,\n_never_ to feel bored--and thankful for the smallest \u00c3\u00a6sthetic or\nromantic mercies. My vision loses itself withal in vaster\nconnections--above all in my general sense of the then grand newness of\nthe Hudson River Railroad; so far at least as its completion to Albany\nwas concerned, a modern blessing that even the youngest of us were in a\nposition to appraise. The time had been when the steamboat had to\ncontent us--and I feel how amply it must have done so as I recall the\nthrill of docking in dim early dawns, the whole hour of the Albany\nwaterside, the night of huge strange paddling and pattering and\nshrieking and creaking once ended, and contrast with it all certain long\nsessions in the train at an age and in conditions when neither train nor\ntraveller had suffered chastening; sessions of a high animation, as I\nrecast them, but at the same time of mortal intensities of lassitude.\nThe elements here indeed are much confused and mixed--I must have known\nthat discipline of the hectic interest and the extravagant strain in\nrelation to Rhinebeck only; an _\u00c3\u00a9tape_, doubtless, on the way to New\nYork, for the Albany kinship, but the limit to our smaller patiences of\nany northward land-journey. And yet not the young fatigue, I repeat, but\nthe state of easy wonder, is what most comes back: the stops too\nrepeated, but perversely engaging; the heat and the glare too great, but\nthe river, by the window, making reaches and glimpses, so that the\ngreat swing of picture and force of light and colour were themselves a\nconstant adventure; the uncles, above all, too pre-eminent, too\nrecurrent, to the creation of a positive soreness of sympathy, of\ncuriosity, and yet constituting by their presence half the enlargement\nof the time. For the presence of uncles, incoherent Albany uncles, is\nsomehow what most gives these hours their stamp for memory. I scarce\nknow why, nor do I much, I confess, distinguish occasions--but I see\nwhat I see: the long, the rattling car of the old open native form and\nthe old harsh native exposure; the sense of arrival forever postponed,\nqualified however also by that of having in my hands a volume of M.\nArs\u00c3\u00a8ne Houssaye, Philosophes et Com\u00c3\u00a9diennes, remarkably submitted by one\nof my relatives to my judgment. I see them always, the relatives, in\nslow circulation; restless and nervous and casual their note, not less\nthan strikingly genial, but with vaguenesses, lapses, eclipses, that\ndeprived their society of a tactless weight. They cheered us on, in\ntheir way; born optimists, clearly, if not logically determined ones,\nthey were always reassuring and sustaining, though with a bright brevity\nthat must have taken immensities, I think, for granted. They wore their\nhats slightly toward the nose, they strolled, they hung about, they\nreported of progress and of the company, they dropped suggestions, new\nmagazines, packets of the edible deprecated for the immature; they\nfigured in fine to a small nephew as the principal men of their time\nand, so far as the two younger and more familiar were concerned, the\nmost splendid as to aspect and apparel. It was none the less to the\nleast shining, though not essentially the least comforting, of this\nsocial trio that, if I rightly remember, I owed my introduction to the\n_chronique galante_ of the eighteenth century.\n\nThere tags itself at any rate to the impression a flutter as of some\nfaint, some recaptured, grimace for another of his kindly offices (which\nI associate somehow with the deck of a steamboat:) his production for\nour vague benefit of a literary classic, the Confessions, as he called\nour attention to them, of the celebrated \"Rosseau\" I catch again the\necho of the mirth excited, to my surprise, by this communication, and\nrecover as well my responsive advance toward a work that seemed so to\npromise; but especially have I it before me that some play of light\ncriticism mostly attended, on the part of any circle, this speaker's\nmore ambitious remarks. For all that, and in spite of oddities of\nappearance and type, it was Augustus James who spread widest, in default\nof towering highest, to my wistful view of the larger life, and who\ncovered definite and accessible ground. This ground, the house and\nprecincts of Linwood, at Rhinebeck, harboured our tender years, I\nsurmise, but at few and brief moments; but it hadn't taken many of these\nto make it the image of an hospitality liberal as I supposed great\nsocial situations were liberal; suppositions on this score having in\nchildhood (or at least they had in mine) as little as possible to do\nwith dry data. Didn't Linwood bristle with great views and other\nglories, with gardens and graperies and black ponies, to say nothing of\ngardeners and grooms who were notoriously and quotedly droll; to say\nnothing, in particular, of our aunt Elizabeth, who had been Miss Bay of\nAlbany, who was the mother of the fair and free young waltzing-women in\nNew York, and who floats back to me through the Rhinebeck picture,\naquiline but easy, with an effect of handsome highbrowed, high-nosed\nlooseness, of dressing-gowns or streaming shawls (the dowdy, the\ndelightful shawl of the period;) and of claws of bright benevolent steel\nthat kept nipping for our charmed advantage: roses and grapes and\npeaches and currant-clusters, together with turns of phrase and scraps\nof remark that fell as by quite a like flash of shears. These are mere\nscrapings of gold-dust, but my mind owes her a vibration that, however\ntiny, was to insist all these years on _marking_--on figuring in a whole\ncomplex of picture and drama, the clearest note of which was that of\nworry and woe: a crisis prolonged, in deep-roofed outer galleries,\nthrough hot August evenings and amid the dim flare of open windows, to\nthe hum of domesticated insects. All but inexpressible the part played,\nin the young mind naturally even though perversely, even though\ninordinately, arranged as a stage for the procession and exhibition of\nappearances, by matters all of a usual cast, contacts and impressions\nnot arriving at the dignity of shocks, but happening to be to the taste,\nas one may say, of the little intelligence, happening to be such as the\nfond fancy could assimilate. One's record becomes, under memories of\nthis order--and that is the only trouble--a tale of assimilations small\nand fine; out of which refuse, directly interesting to the\nsubject-victim only, the most branching vegetations may be conceived as\nhaving sprung. Such are the absurdities of the poor dear inward\nlife--when translated, that is, and perhaps ineffectually translated,\ninto terms of the outward and trying at all to flourish on the lines of\nthe outward; a reflection that might stay me here weren't it that I\nsomehow feel morally affiliated, tied as by knotted fibres, to the\nelements involved.\n\nOne of these was assuredly that my father had again, characteristically,\nsuffered me to dangle; he having been called to Linwood by the dire\ntrouble of his sister, Mrs. Temple, and brought me with him from Staten\nIsland--I make the matter out as of the summer of '54. We had come up,\nhe and I, to New York; but our doings there, with the journey following,\nare a blank to me; I recover but my sense, on our arrival, of being for\nthe first time in the presence of tragedy, which the shining scene,\nroundabout, made more sinister--sharpened even to the point of my\nfeeling abashed and irrelevant, wondering why I had come. My aunt, under\nher brother's roof, had left her husband, wasted with consumption, near\ndeath at Albany; gravely ill herself--she had taken the disease from him\nas it was taken in those days, and was in the event very scantly to\nsurvive him--she had been ordered away in her own interest, for which\nshe cared no scrap, and my father, the person in all his family most\njustly appealed and most anxiously listened to, had been urged to come\nand support her in a separation that she passionately rejected. Vivid to\nme still, as floating across verandahs into the hot afternoon stillness,\nis the wail of her protest and her grief; I remember being scared and\nhushed by it and stealing away beyond its reach. I remember not less\nwhat resources of high control the whole case imputed, for my\nimagination, to my father; and how, creeping off to the edge of the\neminence above the Hudson, I somehow felt the great bright harmonies of\nair and space becoming one with my rather proud assurance and\nconfidence, that of my own connection, for life, for interest, with\nsuch sources of light. The great impression, however, the one that has\nbrought me so far, was another matter: only that of the close,\nlamp-tempered, outer evening aforesaid, with my parent again, somewhere\ndeep within, yet not too far to make us hold our breath for it, tenderly\nopposing his sister's purpose of flight, and the presence at my side of\nmy young cousin Marie, youngest daughter of the house, exactly of my own\nage, and named in honour of her having been born in Paris, to the\ninfluence of which fact her shining black eyes, her small quickness and\nbrownness, marking sharply her difference from her sisters, so oddly, so\nalmost extravagantly testified. It had come home to me by some voice of\nthe air that she was \"spoiled,\" and it made her in the highest degree\ninteresting; we ourselves had been so associated, at home, without being\nin the least spoiled (I think we even rather missed it:) so that I knew\nabout these subjects of invidious reflection only by literature--mainly,\nno doubt, that of the nursery--in which they formed, quite by\nthemselves, a romantic class; and, the fond fancy always predominant, I\nprized even while a little dreading the chance to see the condition at\nwork. This chance was given me, it was clear--though I risk in my record\nof it a final anticlimax--by a remark from my uncle Augustus to his\ndaughter: seated duskily in our group, which included two or three dim\ndependent forms, he expressed the strong opinion that Marie should go to\nbed--expressed it, that is, with the casual cursory humour that was to\nstrike me as the main expressional resource of outstanding members of\nthe family and that would perhaps have had under analysis the defect of\nmaking judgment very personal without quite making authority so.\nAuthority they hadn't, of a truth, these all so human outstanding ones;\nthey made shift but with light appreciation, sudden suggestion, a\npeculiar variety of happy remark in the air. It had been remarked but in\nthe air, I feel sure, that Marie should seek her couch--a truth by the\ndark wing of which I ruefully felt myself brushed; and the words seemed\ntherefore to fall with a certain ironic weight. What I have retained of\ntheir effect, at any rate, is the vague fact of some objection raised by\nmy cousin and some sharper point to his sentence supplied by her father;\npromptly merged in a visible commotion, a flutter of my young companion\nacross the gallery as for refuge in the maternal arms, a protest and an\nappeal in short which drew from my aunt the simple phrase that was from\nthat moment so preposterously to \"count\" for me. \"Come now, my dear;\ndon't make a scene--I _insist_ on your not making a scene!\" That was all\nthe witchcraft the occasion used, but the note was none the less\nepoch-making. The expression, so vivid, so portentous, was one I had\nnever heard--it had never been addressed to us at home; and who should\nsay now what a world one mightn't at once read into it? It seemed\nfreighted to sail so far; it told me so much about life. Life at these\nintensities clearly became \"scenes\"; but the great thing, the immense\nillumination, was that we could make them or not as we chose. It was a\nlong time of course before I began to distinguish between those within\nour compass more particularly as spoiled and those producible on a\ndifferent basis and which should involve detachment, involve presence of\nmind; just the qualities in which Marie's possible output was apparently\ndeficient. It didn't in the least matter accordingly whether or no a\nscene _was_ then proceeded to--and I have lost all count of what\nimmediately happened. The mark had been made for me and the door flung\nopen; the passage, gathering up _all_ the elements of the troubled time,\nhad been itself a scene, quite enough of one, and I had become aware\nwith it of a rich accession of possibilities.\n\n\n\n\nXIV\n\n\nIt must have been after the Sing-Sing episode that Gussy came to us, in\nNew York, for Sundays and holidays, from scarce further off than round\nthe corner--his foreign Institution flourishing, I seem to remember, in\nWest Tenth Street or wherever--and yet as floated by exotic airs and\nwith the scent of the spice-islands hanging about him. He was being\neducated largely with Cubans and Mexicans, in those New York days more\nthan half the little flock of the foreign Institutions in general; over\nwhom his easy triumphs, while he wagged his little red head for them,\nwere abundantly credible; reinforced as my special sense of them was\nmoreover by the similar situation of his sister, older than he but also\nsteeped in the exotic medium and also sometimes bringing us queer echoes\nof the tongues. I remember being deputed by my mother to go and converse\nwith her, on some question of her coming to us, at the establishment of\nMadame Reichhardt (pronounced, \u00c3\u00a0 la fran\u00c3\u00a7aise, R\u00c3\u00a9chard,) where I felt\nthat I had crossed, for the hour, the very threshold of \"Europe\"; it\nbeing impressed on me by my cousin, who was tall and handsome and happy,\nwith a laugh of more beautiful sound than any laugh we were to know\nagain, that French only was speakable on the premises. I sniffed it up\naromatically, the superior language, in passage and parlour--it took the\nform of some strong savoury soup, an educational _potage R\u00c3\u00a9chard_ that\nmust excellently have formed the taste: that was again, I felt as I came\naway, a part of the rich experience of being thrown in tender juvenile\nform upon the world. This genial girl, like her brother, was in the\ngrand situation of having no home and of carrying on life, such a\nsplendid kind of life, by successive visits to relations; though neither\nshe nor Gussy quite achieved the range of their elder brother, \"Bob\" of\nthat ilk, a handsome young man, a just blurred, attractive, illusive\npresence, who hovered a bit beyond our real reach and apparently\ndisplayed the undomesticated character at its highest. _He_ seemed\nexposed, for his pleasure--if pleasure it was!--and my wonder, to every\nassault of experience; his very name took on, from these imputations, a\nbrowner glow; and it was all in the right key that, a few years later,\nhe should, after \"showing some talent for sculpture,\" have gone the\nhapless way of most of the Albany youth, have become a theme for sad\nvague headshakes (kind and very pitying in his case) and died\nprematurely and pointlessly, or in other words, by my conception,\npicturesquely. The headshakes were heavier and the sighs sharper for\nanother slim shade, one of the younger and I believe quite the most\nhapless of those I have called the outstanding ones; he too, several\nyears older than we again, a tormenting hoverer and vanisher; he too\ncharmingly sister'd, though sister'd only, and succumbing to monstrous\nearly trouble after having \"shown some talent\" for music. The\nghostliness of these \u00c3\u00a6sthetic manifestations, as I allude to them, is\nthe thinnest conceivable chip of stray marble, the faintest far-off\ntwang of old chords; I ask myself, for the odd obscurity of it, under\nwhat inspiration music and sculpture may have tinkled and glimmered to\nthe Albany ear and eye (as we at least knew those organs) and with what\nqueer and weak delusions our unfortunates may have played. Quite\nineffably quaint and _falot_ this proposition of _that_ sort of resource\nfor the battle of life as it then and there opened; and above all\nbeautifully suggestive of our sudden collective disconnectedness (ours\nas the whole kinship's) from _the_ American resource of those days,\nAlbanian or other. That precious light was the light of \"business\" only;\nand we, by a common instinct, artlessly joining hands, went forth into\nthe wilderness without so much as a twinkling taper.\n\nOur consensus, on all this ground, was amazing--it brooked no exception;\nthe word had been passed, all round, that we didn't, that we couldn't\nand shouldn't, understand these things, questions of arithmetic and of\nfond calculation, questions of the counting-house and the market; and we\nappear to have held to our agreement as loyally and to have accepted our\ndoom as serenely as if our faith had been mutually pledged. The rupture\nwith my grandfather's tradition and attitude was complete; we were never\nin a single case, I think, for two generations, guilty of a stroke of\nbusiness; the most that could be said of us was that, though about\nequally wanting, all round, in any faculty of acquisition, we happened\nto pay for the amiable weakness less in some connections than in others.\nThe point was that we moved so oddly and consistently--as it was our\nonly form of consistency--over our limited pasture, never straying to\nnibble in the strange or the steep places. What was the matter with us\nunder this spell, and what the moral might have been for our case, are\nissues of small moment, after all, in face of the fact of our mainly so\nbrief duration. It was given to but few of us to be taught by the event,\nto be made to wonder with the last intensity what _had_ been the matter.\nThis it would be interesting to worry out, might I take the time; for\nthe story wouldn't be told, I conceive, by any mere rueful glance at\nother avidities, the preference for ease, the play of the passions, the\nappetite for pleasure. These things have often accompanied the business\nimagination; just as the love of life and the love of other persons, and\nof many of the things of the world, just as quickness of soul and sense,\nhave again and again not excluded it. However, it comes back, as I have\nalready hinted, to the manner in which the \"things of the world\" could\nbut present themselves; there were not enough of these, and they were\nnot fine and fair enough, to engage happily so much unapplied, so much\nloose and crude attention. We hadn't doubtless at all a complete play of\nintelligence--if I may not so far discriminate as to say _they_ hadn't;\nor our lack of the instinct of the market needn't have been so much\nworth speaking of: other curiosities, other sympathies might have\nredressed the balance. I make out our young cousin J. J. as dimly aware\nof this while composing the light melodies that preluded to his\nextinction, and which that catastrophe so tried to admonish us to think\nof as promising; but his image is more present to me still as the great\nincitement, during the few previous years, to our constant dream of\n\"educational\" relief, of some finer kind of social issue, through\nEurope.\n\nIt was to Europe J. J. had been committed; he was over there forging the\nsmall apologetic arms that were so little to avail him, but it was quite\nenough for us that he pointed the way to the Pension Sillig, at Vevey,\nwhich shone at us, from afar, as our own more particular solution. It\nwas true that the Pension Sillig figured mainly as the solution in cases\nof recognised wildness; there long flourished among New York parents\nwhose view of such resources had the proper range a faith in it for that\ncomplaint; and it was as an act of faith that, failing other remedies,\nour young wifeless uncle, conscious himself of no gift for control or\nfor edification, had placed there his difficult son. He returned with\ndelight from this judicious course and there was an hour when we\ninvoked, to intensity, a similar one in our own interest and when the\nair of home did little but reflect from afar the glitter of blue Swiss\nlakes, the tinkle of cattle-bells in Alpine pastures, the rich\n_bonhomie_ that M. Sillig, dispensing an education all of milk and honey\nand edelweiss and ranz-des-vaches, combined with his celebrated firmness\nfor tough subjects. Poor J. J. came back, I fear, much the same subject\nthat he went; but he had verily performed his scant office on earth,\nthat of having brought our then prospect, our apparent possibility, a\ntrifle nearer. He seemed to have been wild even beyond M. Sillig's\nmeasure--which was highly disappointing; but if we might on the other\nhand be open to the reproach of falling too short of it there were\nestablishments adapted to every phase of the American predicament; so\nthat our general direction could but gain in vividness. I think with\ncompassion, altogether, of the comparative obscurity to which our\neventual success in gathering the fruits, few and scant though they\nmight be, thus relegates those to whom it was given but to toy so\nbriefly with the flowers. They make collectively their tragic trio: J.\nJ. the elder, most loved, most beautiful, most sacrificed of the Albany\nuncles; J. J. the younger--they were young together, they were luckless\ntogether, and the combination was as strange as the disaster was\nsweeping; and the daughter and sister, amplest of the \"natural,\" easiest\nof the idle, who lived on to dress their memory with every thread and\npatch of her own perfect temper and then confirm the tradition, after\nall, by too early and woeful an end.\n\nIf it comes over me under the brush of multiplied memories that we might\nwell have invoked the educational \"relief\" I just spoke of, I should\ndoubtless as promptly add that my own case must have been intrinsically\nof the poorest, and indeed make the point once for all that I should be\ntaken as having seen and felt much of the whole queerness through the\nmedium of rare inaptitudes. I can only have been inapt, I make out, to\nhave retained so positively joyless a sense of it all, to be aware of\nmost of it now but as dim confusion, as bewildered anxiety. There was\ninterest always, certainly--but it strikes me to-day as interest in\neverything that wasn't supposedly or prescriptively of the question at\nall, and in nothing that _was_ so respectably involved and accredited.\nWithout some sharpness of interest I shouldn't now have the memories;\nbut these stick to me somehow with none of the hard glue of recovered\n\"spirits,\" recovered vivacities, assurances, successes. I can't have\nhad, through it all, I think, a throb of assurance or success; without\nwhich, at the same time, absurdly and indescribably, I lived and\nwriggled, floundered and failed, lost the clue of everything but a\ngeneral lucid consciousness (lucid, that is, for my tender years;) which\nI clutched with a sense of its value. What happened all the while, I\nconceive, was that I imagined things--and as if quite on system--wholly\nother than as they were, and so carried on in the midst of the actual\nones an existence that somehow floated and saved me even while cutting\nme off from any degree of direct performance, in fact from any degree of\ndirect participation, at all. _There_ presumably was the interest--in\nthe intensity and plausibility and variety of the irrelevance: an\nirrelevance which, for instance, made all pastors and masters, and\nespecially all fellow-occupants of benches and desks, all elbowing and\nkicking presences within touch or view, so many monsters and horrors, so\nmany wonders and splendours and mysteries, but never, so far as I can\nrecollect, realities of relation, dispensers either of knowledge or of\nfate, playmates, intimates, mere co\u00c3\u00a6vals and coequals. They were\nsomething better--better above all than the coequal or co\u00c3\u00a6val; they were\nso thoroughly figures and characters, divinities or demons, and endowed\nin this light with a vividness that the mere reality of relation, a\ncommoner directness of contact, would have made, I surmise,\ncomparatively poor. This superior shade of interest was not, none the\nless, so beguiling that I recall without unmitigated horror, or\nsomething very like it, a winter passed with my brother at the\nInstitution Vergn\u00c3\u00a8s; our sorry subjection to which argues to my present\nsense an unmitigated surrounding aridity. To a \"French school\" must have\nbeen earnestly imputed the virtue of keeping us in patience till easier\ndays should come; infinitely touching our parents' view of that New York\nfetish of our young time, an \"acquisition of the languages\"--an\nacquisition reinforcing those opportunities which we enjoyed at home, so\nfar as they mustered, and at which I have briefly glanced. Charming and\namusing to me indeed certain faint echoes, wavering images, of this\nsuperstition as it played about our path: ladies and gentlemen, dimly\nforeign, mere broken syllables of whose names come back to me, attending\nthere to converse in tongues and then giving way to others through\nfailures of persistence--whether in pupils or preceptors I know not.\nThere hovers even Count Adam Gurowski, Polish, patriotic, exiled,\ntemporarily famous, with the vision of _his_ being invoked for facility\nand then relinquished for difficulty; though I scarce guess on which of\nhis battle-grounds--he was so polyglot that he even had a rich command\nof New Yorkese.\n\n\n\n\nXV\n\n\nIt is to the Institution Vergn\u00c3\u00a8s that my earliest recovery of the sense\nof being in any degree \"educated with\" W. J. attaches itself; an\nestablishment which occupied during the early 'fifties a site in the\nvery middle of Broadway, of the lower, the real Broadway, where it could\nthrob with the very pulse of the traffic in which we all innocently\nrejoiced--believing it, I surmise, the liveliest conceivable: a fact\nthat is by itself, in the light of the present, an odd rococo note. The\nlower Broadway--I allude to the whole Fourth Street and Bond Street\n(where now _is_ the Bond Street of that antiquity?)--was then a seat of\neducation, since we had not done with it, as I shall presently show,\neven when we had done with the Institution, a prompt disillusionment;\nand I brood thus over a period which strikes me as long and during which\nmy personal hours of diligence were somehow more than anything else\nhours of the pavement and the shopfront, or of such contemplative\nexercise as the very considerable distance, for small legs, between\nthose regions and the westward Fourteenth Street might comprise.\nPedestrian gaping having been in childhood, as I have noted,\nprevailingly my line, fate appeared to have kindly provided for it on no\nsmall scale; to the extent even that it must have been really my sole\nand single form of athletics. Vague heated competition and agitation in\nthe then enclosed Union Square would seem to point a little, among us\nall, to nobler types of motion; but of any basis for recreation,\nanything in the nature of a playground or a breathing-space, the\nInstitution itself was serenely innocent. This I take again for a note\nextraordinarily medi\u00c3\u00a6val. It occupied the first and second floors, if I\nrightly remember, of a wide front that, overhanging the endless\nthoroughfare, looked out on bouncing, clattering \"stages\" and painfully\ndragged carts and the promiscuous human shuffle--the violence of\nrepercussions from the New York pavement of those years to be further\ntaken into account; and I win it back from every side as, in spite of\nthese aspects of garish publicity, a dark and dreadful, and withal quite\nabsurd, scene. I see places of that general time, even places of\nconfinement, in a dusty golden light that special memories of small\nmisery scarce in the least bedim, and this holds true of our next and\nquite neighbouring refuge; the establishment of M. Vergn\u00c3\u00a8s alone darkles\nand shrinks to me--a sordidly _black_ interior is my main image for it;\nattenuated only by its having very soon afterwards, as a suffered\nordeal, altogether lapsed and intermitted. Faintly, in the gloom, I\ndistinguish M. Vergn\u00c3\u00a8s himself--quite \"old,\" very old indeed as I\nsupposed him, and highly irritated and markedly bristling; though of\nnothing in particular that happened to me at his or at anyone's else\nhands have I the scantest remembrance. What really most happened no\ndoubt, was that my brother and I should both come away with a mind\nprepared for a perfect assimilation of Alphonse Daudet's chronicle of\n\"Jack,\" years and years later on; to make the acquaintance in that work\nof the \"petits pays chauds\" among whom Jack learnt the first lessons of\nlife was to see the Institution Vergn\u00c3\u00a8s at once revive, swarming as it\ndid with small homesick Cubans and Mexicans; the complete failure of\nblondness that marks the memory is doubtless the cumulative effect of so\nmany of the New York \"petits pays chauds,\" preponderantly brown and\nblack and conducing to a greasy gloom. Into this gloom I fear I should\nsee all things recede together but for a certain salient note, the fact\nthat the whole \"staff\" appears to have been constantly in a rage; from\nwhich naturally resulted the accent of shrillness (the only accent we\ncould pick up, though we were supposed to be learning, for the extreme\nimportance of it, quantities of French) and the sound of high\nvociferation. I remember infuriated ushers, of foreign speech and\nflushed complexion--the tearing across of hapless \"exercises\" and\n_dict\u00c3\u00a9es_ and the hurtle through the air of dodged volumes; only never,\ndespite this, the extremity of smiting. There can have been at the\nInstitution no blows instructionally dealt--nor even from our hours of\nease do any such echoes come back to me. Little Cubans and Mexicans, I\nmake out, were not to be vulgarly whacked--in deference, presumably, to\nsome latent relic or imputed survival of Castilian pride; which would\nimpose withal considerations of quite practical prudence. Food for\nreflection and comparison might well have been so suggested; interesting\nat least the element of contrast between such opposed conceptions of\ntone, temper and manner as the passion without whacks, or with whacks\nonly of inanimate objects, ruling the scene I have described, and the\nwhacks without passion, the grim, impersonal, strictly penal\napplications of the rod, which then generally represented what was still\ninvolved in our English tradition. It was the two theories of\nsensibility, of personal dignity, that so diverged; but with such other\ndivergences now on top of those that the old comparison falls away. We\nto-day go unwhacked altogether--though from a pride other than\nCastilian: it is difficult to say at least what ideal has thus\ntriumphed. In the Vergn\u00c3\u00a8s air at any rate I seem myself to have sat\nunscathed and unterrified--not alarmed even by so much as a call to the\nblackboard; only protected by my insignificance, which yet covered such\na sense of our dusky squalor. Queer for us the whole affair, assuredly;\nbut how much queerer for the poor petits pays chauds who had come so far\nfor their privilege. _We_ had come, comparatively, but from round the\ncorner--and that left the \"state of education\" and the range of\nselection all about as quaint enough. What could these things then have\nbeen in the various native climes of the petits pays chauds?\n\nIt was by some strong wave of reaction, clearly, that we were floated\nnext into the quieter haven of Mr. Richard Pulling Jenks--where cleaner\nwaters, as I feel their coolness still, must have filled a neater\nthough, it was true, slightly more contracted trough. Yet the range of\nselection had been even on this higher plane none too strikingly\nexemplified; our jumping had scant compass--we still grubbed with a good\nconscience in Broadway and sidled about Fourth Street. But I think of\nthe higher education as having there, from various causes, none the less\nbegun to glimmer for us. A diffused brightness, a kind of high\ncrosslight of conflicting windows, rests for me at all events on the\nlittle realm of Mr. Pulling Jenks and bathes it as with positively sweet\nlimitations. Limited must it have been, I feel, with our couple of\nmiddling rooms, front and back, our close packing, our large\nunaccommodating stove, our grey and gritty oilcloth, and again our\nimportunate Broadway; from the aggregation of which elements there\ndistils itself, without my being able to account for it, a certain\nperversity of romance. I speak indeed here for myself in particular, and\nkeen for romance must I have been in such conditions, I admit; since the\nsense of it had crept into a recreational desert even as utter as that\nof the Institution Vergn\u00c3\u00a8s. Up out of Broadway we still scrambled--I can\nsmell the steep and cold and dusty wooden staircase; straight into\nBroadway we dropped--I feel again the generalised glare of liberation;\nand I scarce know what tenuity of spirit it argues that I should neither\nhave enjoyed nor been aware of missing (speaking again for myself only)\na space wider than the schoolroom floor to react and knock about in. I\nliterally conclude that we must have knocked about in Broadway, and in\nBroadway alone, like perfect little men of the world; we must have been\nlet loose there to stretch our legs and fill our lungs, without\nprejudice either to our earlier and later freedoms of going and coming.\nI as strictly infer, at the same time, that Broadway must have been then\nas one of the alleys of Eden, for any sinister contact or consequence\ninvolved for us; a circumstance that didn't in the least interfere, too,\nas I have noted, with its offer of an entrancing interest. The interest\nverily could have been a _calculated_ thing on the part of our dear\nparents as little as on that of Mr. Jenks himself. Therefore let it be\nrecorded as still most odd that we should all have assented to such\ndeficiency of landscape, such exiguity of sport. I take the true\ninwardness of the matter to have been in our having such short hours,\nlong as they may have appeared at the time, that the day left margin at\nthe worst for private inventions. I think we found landscape, for\nourselves--and wherever I at least found vision I found such sport as I\nwas capable of--even between the front and back rooms and the\nconflicting windows; even by the stove which somehow scorched without\nwarming, and yet round which Mr. Coe and Mr. Dolmidge, the\ndrawing-master and the writing-master, arriving of a winter's day, used\nnotedly, and in the case of Mr. Coe lamentedly, to draw out their\ndelays. Is the dusty golden light of retrospect in this connection an\neffluence from Mr. Dolmidge and Mr. Coe, whose ministrations come back\nto me as the sole directly desired or invoked ones I was to know in my\nyears, such as they were, of pupilage?\n\nI see them in any case as old-world images, figures of an antique stamp;\nproducts, mustn't they have been, of an order in which some social\nrelativity or matter-of-course adjustment, some transmitted form and\npressure, were still at work? Mr. Dolmidge, inordinately lean,\nclean-shaved, as was comparatively uncommon then, and in a\nswallow-tailed coat and I think a black satin stock, was surely perfect\nin his absolutely functional way, a pure pen-holder of a man, melancholy\nand mild, who taught the most complicated flourishes--great scrolls of\nthem met our view in the form of surging seas and beaked and beady-eyed\neagles, the eagle being so calligraphic a bird--while he might just have\ntaught resignation. He was not at all funny--no one out of our immediate\nfamily circle, in fact almost no one but W. J. himself, who flowered in\nevery waste, seems to have struck me as funny in those years; but he was\nto remain with me a picture of somebody in Dickens, one of the Phiz if\nnot the Cruikshank pictures. Mr. Coe was another affair, bristling with\nthe question of the \"hard,\" but somehow too with the revelation of the\nsoft, the deeply attaching; a worthy of immense stature and presence,\ncrowned as with the thick white hair of genius, wearing a great gathered\nor puckered cloak, with a vast velvet collar, and resembling, as he\ncomes back to me, the General Winfield Scott who lived so much in our\neyes then. The oddity may well even at that hour have been present to me\nof its taking so towering a person to produce such small\n\"drawing-cards\"; it was as if some mighty bird had laid diminutive eggs.\nMr. Coe, of a truth, laid his all over the place, and though they were\nnot of more than handy size--very small boys could set them up in state\non very small desks--they had doubtless a great range of number and\neffect. They were scattered far abroad and I surmise celebrated; they\nrepresented crooked cottages, feathery trees, browsing and bristling\nbeasts and other rural objects; all rendered, as I recall them, in\nlittle detached dashes that were like stories told in words of one\nsyllable, or even more perhaps in short gasps of delight. It must have\nbeen a stammering art, but I admired its fluency, which swims for me\nmoreover in richer though slightly vague associations. Mr. Coe practised\non a larger scale, in colour, in oils, producing wondrous neat little\nboards that make me to this day think of them and more particularly\nsmell them, when I hear of a \"panel\" picture: a glamour of greatness\nattends them as brought home by W. J. from the master's own place of\ninstruction in that old University building which partly formed the east\nside of Washington Square and figures to memory, or to fond imagination,\nas throbbing with more offices and functions, a denser chiaroscuro, than\nany reared hugeness of to-day, where character is so lost in quantity.\nIs there any present structure that plays such a part in proportion to\nits size?--though even as I ask the question I feel how nothing on earth\nis proportioned to present sizes. These alone are proportioned--and to\nmere sky-space and mere amount, amount of steel and stone; which is\ncomparatively uninteresting. Perhaps our needs and our elements were\nthen absurdly, were then provincially few, and that the patches of\ncharacter in that small grey granite compendium were all we had in\ngeneral to exhibit. Let me add at any rate that some of them were\nexhibitional--even to my tender years, I mean; since I respond even yet\nto my privilege of presence at some Commencement or Commemoration, such\nas might be natural, doubtless, to any \"university,\" where, as under a\nhigh rich roof, before a Chancellor in a gown and amid serried admirers\nand impressive applause, there was \"speaking,\" of the finest sort, and\nwhere above all I gathered in as a dazzling example the rare assurance\nof young Winthrop Somebody or Somebody Winthrop, who, though still in\njackets, held us spellbound by his rendering of Serjeant Buzfuz's\nexposure of Mr. Pickwick. Long was I to marvel at the high sufficiency\nof young Winthrop Somebody or Somebody Winthrop--in which romantic\nimpression it is perhaps after all (though with the consecration of one\nor two of the novels of the once-admired Theodore of that name, which so\nremarkably insists, thrown in) the sense of the place is embalmed.\n\nI must not forget indeed that I throw in also Mr. Coe--even if with\nless assured a hand; by way of a note on those higher flights of power\nand promise that I at this time began to see definitely determined in my\nbrother. As I catch W. J.'s image, from far back, at its most\ncharacteristic, he sits drawing and drawing, always drawing, especially\nunder the lamplight of the Fourteenth Street back parlour; and not as\nwith a plodding patience, which I think would less have affected me, but\neasily, freely and, as who should say, infallibly: always at the stage\nof finishing off, his head dropped from side to side and his tongue\nrubbing his lower lip. I recover a period during which to see him at all\nwas so to see him--the other flights and faculties removed him from my\nview. These were a matter of course--he recurred, he passed nearer, but\nin his moments of ease, and I clearly quite accepted the ease of his\ndisappearances. Didn't he always when within my view light them up and\njustify them by renewed and enlarged vividness? so that my whole sense\nof him as formed for assimilations scarce conceivable made our gaps of\ncontact too natural for me even to be lessons in humility. Humility had\nnothing to do with it--as little even as envy would have had; I was\nbelow humility, just as we were together outside of competition,\nmutually \"hors concours.\" _His_ competitions were with others--in which\nhow wasn't he, how could he not be, successful? while mine were with\nnobody, or nobody's with me, which came to the same thing, as heaven\nknows I neither braved them nor missed them. That winter, as I recover\nit, represents him as sufficiently within view to make his position or\nwhereabouts in the upper air definite--I must have taken it for granted\nbefore, but could now in a manner measure it; and the freshness of this\nsense, something serene in my complacency, had to do, I divine, with the\neffect of our moving, with the rest of our company, which was not\nnumerous but practically, but appreciably \"select,\" on a higher and\nfairer plane than ever yet. Predominantly of course we owed this benefit\nto Richard Pulling himself; of whom I recall my brother's saying to me,\nat a considerably later time, and with an authority that affected me as\nabsolute, that he had been of all our masters the most truly genial, in\nfact the only one to whom the art of exciting an interest or inspiring a\nsympathy could be in any degree imputed. I take this to have meant that\nhe would have adorned a higher sphere--and it may have been, to explain\nhis so soon swimming out of our ken, that into a higher sphere he\nrapidly moved; I can account at least for our falling away from him the\nvery next year and declining again upon baser things and a lower\ncivilisation but by some probability of his flight, just thereafter\neffected, to a greater distance, to one of the far upper reaches of the\ntown. Some years must have elapsed and some distinction have crowned\nhim when, being briefly in New York together, W. J. and I called on him\nof a Sunday afternoon, to find--what I hadn't been at all sure of--that\nhe still quite knew who we were, or handsomely pretended to; handsomely\nin spite of his markedly confirmed identity of appearance with the\nPunch, husband to Judy, of the funny papers and the street show. Bald,\nrotund, of ruddy complexion, with the nose, the chin, the arched eye,\nthe paunch and the _barbiche_, to say nothing of the ferule nursed in\nhis arms and with which, in the show, such free play is made, Mr. Jenks\nyet seems to me to have preserved a dignity as well as projected an\nimage, and in fact have done other things besides. He whacked\noccasionally--he must have been one of the last of the whackers; but I\ndon't remember it as ugly or dreadful or droll--don't remember, that is,\neither directly feeling or reflectively enjoying it: it fails somehow to\nbreak the spell of our civilisation; my share in which, however, comes\nback to me as merely contemplative. It is beyond measure odd, doubtless,\nthat my main association with my \"studies,\" whether of the infant or the\nadolescent order, should be with almost anything but the fact of\nlearning--of learning, I mean, what I was supposed to learn. I could\nonly have been busy, at the same time, with other pursuits--which must\nhave borne some superficial likeness at least to the acquisition of\nknowledge of a free irresponsible sort; since I remember few either of\nthe inward pangs or the outward pains of a merely graceless state. I\nrecognise at the same time that it was perhaps a sorry business to be so\ninterested in one didn't know what. Such are, whether at the worst or at\nthe best, some of the aspects of that season as Mr. Jenks's image\npresides; in the light of which I _may_ perhaps again rather wonder at\nmy imputation to the general picture of so much amenity. Clearly the\ngood man was a civiliser--whacks and all; and by some art not now to be\ndetected. He was a complacent classic--which was what my brother's claim\nfor him, I dare say, mostly represented; though that passed over the\nhead of my tenth year. It was a good note for him in this particular\nthat, deploring the facile text-books of Doctor Anthon of Columbia\nCollege, in which there was even more crib than text, and holding fast\nto the sterner discipline of Andrews and Stoddard and of that other more\nconservative commentator (he too doubtless long since superseded) whose\nname I blush to forget. I think in fine of Richard Pulling's small but\nsincere academy as a consistent little protest against its big and easy\nand quite out-distancing rival, the Columbia College school, apparently\nin those days quite the favourite of fortune.\n\n\n\n\nXVI\n\n\nI must in some degree have felt it a charm there that we were not, under\nhis rule, inordinately prepared for \"business,\" but were on the contrary\nto remember that the taste of Cornelius Nepos in the air, even rather\nstale though it may have been, had lacked the black bitterness marking\nour next ordeal and that I conceive to have proceeded from some rank\npredominance of the theory and practice of book-keeping. It had\nconsorted with this that we found ourselves, by I know not what\ninconsequence, a pair of the \"assets\" of a firm; Messrs. Forest and\nQuackenboss, who carried on business at the northwest corner of\nFourteenth Street and Sixth Avenue, having for the winter of 1854-5\ntaken our education in hand. As their establishment had the style, so I\nwas conscious at the time of its having the general stamp and sense, of\na shop--a shop of long standing, of numerous clients, of lively bustle\nand traffic. The structure itself was to my recent recognition still\nthere and more than ever a shop, with improvements and extensions, but\ndealing in other wares than those anciently and as I suppose then quite\nfreshly purveyed; so far at least as freshness was imputable to the\nsenior member of the firm, who had come down to our generation from a\nlegendary past and with a striking resemblance of head and general air\nto Benjamin Franklin. Mr. Forest, under whose more particular attention\nI languished, had lasted on from a plainer age and, having formed, by\nthe legend, in their youth, the taste of two or three of our New York\nuncles--though for what it could have been goodness only knew--was still\nof a _trempe_ to whack in the fine old way at their nephews and sons. I\nsee him aloft, benevolent and hard, mildly massive, in a black dress\ncoat and trousers and a white neckcloth that should have figured, if it\ndidn't, a frill, and on the highest rostrum of our experience, whence he\ncomes back to me as the dryest of all our founts of knowledge, though\nquite again as a link with far-off manners and forms and as the most\n\"historic\" figure we had ever had to do with. W. J., as I distinguish,\nhad in truth scarcely to do with him--W. J. lost again on upper floors,\nin higher classes, in real pursuits, and connecting me, in an indirect\nand almost deprecated manner, with a strange, curly, glossy, an anointed\nand bearded, Mr. Quackenboss, the junior partner, who conducted the\nclassical department and never whacked--only sent down his subjects,\nwith every confidence, to his friend. I make out with clearness that Mr.\nForest was awful and arid, and yet that somehow, by the same stroke, we\ndidn't, under his sway, go in terror, only went exceedingly in want;\neven if in want indeed of I scarce (for myself) know what, since it\nmight well have been enough for me, in so resounding an air, to escape\nwith nothing worse than a failure of thrill. If I didn't feel that\ninterest I must clearly not have inspired it, and I marvel afresh, under\nthese memories, at the few points at which I appear to have touched\nconstituted reality. That, however, is a different connection\naltogether, and I read back into the one I have been noting much of the\nchill, or at least the indifference, of a foreseen and foredoomed\ndetachment: it was during that winter that I began to live by\nanticipation in another world and to feel our uneasy connection with New\nYork loosen beyond recovery. I remember for how many months, when the\nrupture took place, we had been to my particular consciousness virtually\nin motion; though I regain at the same time the impression of more\nexperience on the spot than had marked our small previous history: this,\nhowever, a branch of the matter that I must for the moment brush aside.\nFor it would have been meanwhile odd enough to hold us in arrest a\nmoment--that quality of our situation that could suffer such elements as\nthose I have glanced at to take so considerably the place of education\nas more usually and conventionally understood, and by that\nunderstanding more earnestly mapped out; a deficiency, in the whole\nthing, that I fail at all consistently to deplore, however--struck as I\nam with the rare fashion after which, in any small victim of life, the\ninward perversity may work.\n\nIt works by converting to its uses things vain and unintended, to the\ngreat discomposure of their prepared opposites, which it by the same\nstroke so often reduces to naught; with the result indeed that one may\nmost of all see it--so at least have I quite exclusively seen it, the\nlittle life out for its chance--as proceeding by the inveterate process\nof conversion. As I reconsider both my own and my brother's early\nstart--even his too, made under stronger propulsions--it is quite for me\nas if the authors of our being and guardians of our youth had virtually\nsaid to us but one thing, directed our course but by one word, though\nconstantly repeated: Convert, convert, convert! With which I have not\neven the sense of any needed appeal in us for further apprehension of\nthe particular precious metal our chemistry was to have in view. I taste\nagain in that pure air no ghost of a hint, for instance, that the\nprecious metal was the refined gold of \"success\"--a reward of effort for\nwhich I remember to have heard at home no good word, nor any sort of\nword, ever faintly breathed. It was a case of the presumption that we\nshould hear words enough abundantly elsewhere; so that any dignity the\nidea might claim was in the first place not worth insisting on, and in\nthe second might well be overstated. We were to convert and convert,\nsuccess--in the sense that was in the general air--or no success; and\nsimply everything that should happen to us, every contact, every\nimpression and every experience we should know, were to form our soluble\nstuff; with only ourselves to thank should we remain unaware, by the\ntime our perceptions were decently developed, of the substance finally\nprojected and most desirable. That substance might be just consummately\nVirtue, as a social grace and value--and as a matter furthermore on\nwhich pretexts for ambiguity of view and of measure were as little as\npossible called upon to flourish. This last luxury therefore quite\nfailed us, and we understood no whit the less what was suggested and\nexpected because of the highly liberal way in which the pill, if I may\ncall it so, was gilded: it had been made up--to emphasise my image--in\nso bright an air of humanity and gaiety, of charity and humour. What I\nspeak of is the medium itself, of course, that we were most immediately\nsteeped in--I am glancing now at no particular turn of our young\nattitude in it, and I can scarce sufficiently express how little it\ncould have conduced to the formation of prigs. Our father's prime\nhorror was of _them_--he only cared for virtue that was more or less\nashamed of itself; and nothing could have been of a happier whimsicality\nthan the mixture in him, and in all his walk and conversation, of the\nstrongest instinct for the human and the liveliest reaction from the\nliteral. The literal played in our education as small a part as it\nperhaps ever played in any, and we wholesomely breathed inconsistency\nand ate and drank contradictions. The presence of paradox was so bright\namong us--though fluttering ever with as light a wing and as short a\nflight as need have been--that we fairly grew used to allow, from an\nearly time, for the so many and odd declarations we heard launched, to\nthe extent of happily \"discounting\" them; the moral of all of which was\nthat we need never fear not to be good enough if we were only social\nenough: a splendid meaning indeed being attached to the latter term.\n\nThus we had ever the amusement, since I can really call it nothing less,\nof hearing morality, or moralism, as it was more invidiously worded,\nmade hay of in the very interest of character and conduct; these things\nsuffering much, it seemed, by their association with the\nconscience--that is the _conscious_ conscience--the very home of the\nliteral, the haunt of so many pedantries. Pedantries, on all this\nground, were anathema; and if our dear parent had at all minded his not\nbeing consistent, and had entertained about us generally less\npassionate an optimism (not an easy but an arduous state in him\nmoreover,) he might have found it difficult to apply to the promotion of\nour studies so free a suspicion of the inhumanity of Method. Method\ncertainly never quite raged among us; but it was our fortune\nnevertheless that everything had its turn, and that such indifferences\nwere no more pedantic than certain rigours might perhaps have been; of\nall of which odd notes of our situation there would, and possibly will,\nbe more to say--my present aim is really but to testify to what most\ncomes up for me to-day in the queer educative air I have been trying to\nbreathe again. That definite reflection is that if we had not had in us\nto some degree the root of the matter no method, however confessedly or\naggressively \"pedantic,\" would much have availed for us; and that since\nwe apparently did have it, deep down and inert in our small patches of\nvirgin soil, the fashion after which it struggled forth was an\nexperience as intense as any other and a record of as great a dignity.\nIt may be asked me, I recognise, of the root of \"what\" matter I so\ncomplacently speak, and if I say \"Why, of the matter of our having with\nconsiderable intensity _proved_ educable, or, if you like better,\nteachable, that is accessible to experience,\" it may again be retorted:\n\"That won't do for a decent account of a young consciousness; for think\nof all the things that the failure of method, of which you make so\nlight, didn't put into yours; think of the splendid economy of a\nreal--or at least of a planned and attempted education, a 'regular\ncourse of instruction'--and then think of the waste involved in the so\ninferior substitute of which the pair of you were evidently victims.\" An\nadmonition this on which I brood, less, however, than on the still other\nsense, rising from the whole retrospect, of my now feeling sure, of my\nhaving mastered the particular history of just that waste--to the point\nof its actually affecting me as blooming with interest, to the point\neven of its making me ask myself how in the world, if the question is of\nthe injection of more things into the consciousness (as would seem the\ncase,) mine could have \"done\" with more: thanks to its small trick,\nperhaps vicious I admit, of having felt itself from an early time almost\nuncomfortably stuffed. I see my critic, by whom I mean my representative\nof method at any price, take in this plea only to crush it with his\nconfidence--that without the signal effects of method one must have had\nby an inexorable law to resort to shifts and ingenuities, and can\ntherefore only have been an artful dodger more or less successfully\ndodging. I take full account of the respectability of the prejudice\nagainst one or two of the uses to which the intelligence may at a pinch\nbe put--the criminal use in particular of falsifying its history, of\nforging its records even, and of appearing greater than the traceable\ngrounds warrant. One can but fall back, none the less, on the particular\n_un_traceability of grounds--when it comes to that: cases abound so in\nwhich, with the grounds all there, the intelligence itself is not to be\nidentified. I contend for nothing moreover but the lively interest of\nthe view, and above all of the measure, of almost any mental history\nafter the fact. Of less interest, comparatively, is that sight of the\nmind _before_--before the demonstration of the fact, that is, and while\nstill muffled in theories and presumptions (purple and fine linen, and\nas such highly becoming though these be) of what shall prove best for\nit.\n\nWhich doubtless too numerous remarks have been determined by my sense of\nthe tenuity of some of my clues: I had begun to count our wavering steps\nfrom so very far back, and with a lively disposition, I confess, not to\nmiss even the vaguest of them. I can scarce indeed overstate the\nvagueness that quite _had_ to attend a great number in presence of the\nfact that our father, caring for our spiritual decency unspeakably more\nthan for anything else, anything at all that might be or might become\nours, would have seemed to regard this cultivation of it as profession\nand career enough for us, had he but betrayed more interest in our\nmastery of _any_ art or craft. It was not certainly that the profession\nof virtue would have been anything less than abhorrent to him, but that,\nsingular though the circumstance, there were times when he might have\nstruck us as having after all more patience with it than with this, that\nor the other more technical thrifty scheme. Of the beauty of his\ndissimulated anxiety and tenderness on these and various other suchlike\nheads, however, other examples will arise; for I see him now as fairly\nafraid to recognise certain anxieties, fairly declining to dabble in the\nharshness of practical precautions or impositions. The effect of his\nattitude, so little thought out as shrewd or as vulgarly providential,\nbut in spite of this so socially and affectionally founded, could only\nbe to make life interesting to us at the worst, in default of making it\nextraordinarily \"paying.\" He had a theory that it would somehow or other\nalways be paying enough--and this much less by any poor conception of\nour wants (for he delighted in our wants and so sympathetically and\nsketchily and summarily wanted _for_ us) than by a happy and friendly,\nthough slightly nebulous, conception of our resources. Delighting ever\nin the truth while generously contemptuous of the facts, so far as we\nmight make the difference--the facts having a way of being many and the\ntruth remaining but one--he held that there would always be enough;\nsince the truth, the true truth, was never ugly and dreadful, and we\ndidn't and wouldn't depart from it by any cruelty or stupidity (for he\nwouldn't have had us stupid,) and might therefore depend on it for due\nabundance even of meat and drink and raiment, even of wisdom and wit and\nhonour. It is too much to say that our so preponderantly humanised and\nsocialised adolescence was to make us look out for these things with a\nsubtle indirectness; but I return to my proposition that there may still\nbe a charm in seeing such hazards at work through a given, even if not\nin a systematised, case. My cases are of course given, so that economy\nof observation after the fact, as I have called it, becomes inspiring,\nnot less than the amusement, or whatever it may be, of the question of\nwhat might happen, of what in point of fact did happen, to several very\ntowny and domesticated little persons, who were confirmed in their\ntowniness and fairly enriched in their sensibility, instead of being\nchucked into a scramble or exposed on breezy uplands under the she-wolf\nof competition and discipline. Perhaps any success that attended the\nexperiment--which was really, as I have hinted, no plotted thing at all,\nbut only an accident of accidents--proceeded just from the fact that the\nsmall subjects, a defeated Romulus, a prematurely sacrificed Remus, had\nin their very sensibility an asset, as we have come to say, a principle\nof life and even of \"fun.\" Perhaps on the other hand the success would\nhave been greater with less of that particular complication or\nfacilitation and more of some other which I shall be at a loss to\nidentify. What I find in my path happens to be the fact of the\nsensibility, and from the light it sheds the curious, as also the\ncommon, things that did from occasion to occasion play into it seem each\nto borrow a separate and vivifying glow.\n\nAs at the Institution Vergn\u00c3\u00a8s and at Mr. Pulling Jenks's, however this\nmight be, so at \"Forest's,\" or in other words at the more numerous\nestablishment of Messrs. Forest and Quackenboss, where we spent the\nwinter of 1854, reality, in the form of multitudinous mates, was to have\nswarmed about me increasingly: at Forest's the prolonged roll-call in\nthe morning, as I sit in the vast bright crowded smelly smoky room, in\nwhich rusty black stove-shafts were the nearest hint of architecture,\nbristles with names, Hoes and Havemeyers, Stokeses, Phelpses, Colgates\nand others, of a subsequently great New York salience. It was sociable\nand gay, it was sordidly spectacular, one was then, by an inch or two, a\nbigger boy--though with crushing superiorities in that line all round;\nand when I wonder why the scene was sterile (which was what I took it\nfor at the worst) the reason glooms out again in the dreadful blight of\narithmetic, which affected me at the time as filling all the air. The\nquantity imposed may not in fact have been positively gross, yet it is\nwhat I most definitely remember--not, I mean, that I have retained the\ndimmest notion of the science, but only of the dire image of our being\nin one way or another always supposedly addressed to it. I recall\nstrange neighbours and deskfellows who, not otherwise too objectionable,\nwere uncanny and monstrous through their possession, cultivation,\nimitation of ledgers, daybooks, double-entry, tall pages of figures,\ninterspaces streaked with oblique ruled lines that weirdly \"balanced,\"\nwhatever that might mean, and other like horrors. Nothing in truth is\nmore distinct to me than the tune to which they were, without exception,\nat their ease on such ground--unless it be my general dazzled,\nhumiliated sense, through those years, of the common, the baffling,\nmastery, all round me, of a hundred handy arts and devices. Everyone did\nthings and had things--everyone knew how, even when it was a question of\nthe small animals, the dormice and grasshoppers, or the hoards of food\nand stationery, that they kept in their desks, just as they kept in\ntheir heads such secrets for how to do sums--those secrets that I must\neven then have foreseen I should even so late in life as this have\nfailed to discover. I may have known things, have by that time learnt a\nfew, myself, but I didn't know _that_--what I did know; whereas those\nwho surrounded me were all agog, to my vision, with the benefit of their\nknowledge. I see them, in this light, across the years, fairly grin and\ngrimace with it; and the presumable vulgarity of some of them, certain\nscattered shades of baseness still discernible, comes to me as but one\nof the appearances of an abounding play of genius. Who was it I ever\nthought stupid?--even when knowing, or at least feeling, that sundry\nexpressions of life or force, which I yet had no name for, represented\nsomehow art without grace, or (what after a fashion came to the same\nthing) presence without type. All of which, I should add, didn't in the\nleast prevent my moving on the plane of the remarkable; so that if, as I\nhave noted, the general blank of consciousness, in the conditions of\nthat winter, rather tended to spread, this could perhaps have but had\nfor its best reason that I was fairly gorged with wonders. They were too\nmuch of the same kind; the result, that is, of everyone's seeming to\nknow everything--to the effect, a little, that everything suffered by\nit. There was a boy called Simpson my juxtaposition to whom I recall as\nuninterruptedly close, and whose origin can only have been, I think,\nquite immediately Irish--and Simpson, I feel sure, was a friendly and\nhelpful character. Yet even he reeked, to my sense, with strange\naccomplishment--no single show of which but was accompanied in him by a\nsmart protrusion of the lower lip, a crude complacency of power, that\nalmost crushed me to sadness. It is as if I had passed in that sadness\nmost of those ostensibly animated months; an effect however doubtless in\nsome degree proceeding, for later appreciation, from the more\nintelligible nearness of the time--it had brought me to the end of my\ntwelfth year; which helps not a little to turn it to prose. How I gave\nto that state, in any case, such an air of occupation as to beguile not\nonly myself but my instructors--which I infer I did from their so\nintensely letting me alone--I am quite at a loss to say; I have in truth\nmainly the remembrance of _being_ consistently either ignored or\nexquisitely considered (I know not which to call it;) even if without\nthe belief, which would explain it, that I passed for generally\n\"wanting\" any more than for naturally odious. It was strange, at all\nevents--it could only have been--to be so stupid without being more\nbrutish and so perceptive without being more keen. Here were a case and\na problem to which no honest master with other and better cases could\nhave felt justified in giving time; he would have had at least to be\nmorbidly curious, and I recall from that sphere of rule no instance\nwhatever of the least refinement of inquiry. I should even probably have\nmissed one of these more flattering shades of attention had I missed\nattention at all; but I think I was never really aware of how little I\ngot or how much I did without. I read back into the whole connection\nindeed the chill, or at least the indifference, of a foreseen and\nforedoomed detachment: I have noted how at this desperate juncture the\nmild forces making for our conscious relief, pushing the door to Europe\ndefinitely open, began at last to be effective. Nothing seemed to matter\nat all but that I should become personally and incredibly acquainted\nwith Piccadilly and Richmond Park and Ham Common. I regain at the same\ntime the impression of more experience on the spot than had marked our\nsmall previous history.\n\nPitiful as it looks to these ampler days the mere little fact that a\nsmall court for recreation was attached to our academy added something\nof a grace to life. We descended in relays, for \"intermission,\" into a\npaved and walled yard of the scantest size; the only provision for any\nsuch privilege--not counting the street itself, of which, at the worst\nof other conditions, we must have had free range--that I recover from\nthose years. The ground is built over now, but I could still figure, on\na recent occasion, our small breathing-space; together with my then\nabject little sense that it richly sufficed--or rather, positively, that\nnothing could have been more romantic. For within our limit we freely\nconversed, and at nothing did I assist with more interest than at free\nconversation. Certain boys hover before me, the biggest, the fairest,\nthe most worthy of freedom, dominating the scene and scattering upon\nfifty subjects the most surprising lights. One of these heroes, whose\nstature and complexion are still there for me to admire, did tricks of\nlegerdemain, with the scant apparatus of a handkerchief, a key, a\npocket-knife--as to some one of which it is as fresh as yesterday that I\ningenuously invited him to show me how to do it, and then, on his\ntreating me with scorn, renewed without dignity my fond solicitation.\nFresher even than yesterday, fadelessly fresh for me at this hour, is\nthe cutting remark thereupon of another boy, who certainly wasn't\nSimpson and whose identity is lost for me in his mere inspired\nauthority: \"Oh, oh, oh, I should think you'd be too proud--!\" I had\nneither been too proud nor so much as conceived that one might be, but I\nremember well how it flashed on me with this that I had failed thereby\nof a high luxury or privilege--which the whole future, however, might\nhelp me to make up for. To what extent it _has_ helped is another\nmatter, but so fine was the force of the suggestion that I think I have\nnever in all the years made certain returns upon my spirit without again\nfeeling the pang from the cool little voice of the Fourteenth Street\nyard. Such was the moral exercise it at least allowed us room for. It\nalso allowed us room, to be just, for an inordinate consumption of hot\nwaffles retailed by a benevolent black \"auntie\" who presided, with her\nhusband's aid as I remember, at a portable stove set up in a passage or\nrecess opening from the court; to which we flocked and pushed, in a\nmerciless squeeze, with all our coppers, and the products of which, the\noblong farinaceous compound, faintly yet richly brown, stamped and\nsmoking, not crisp nor brittle, but softly absorbent of the syrup dabbed\nupon it for a finish, revealed to me I for a long time, even for a very\nlong time supposed, the highest pleasure of sense. We stamped about, we\nfreely conversed, we ate sticky waffles by the hundred--I recall no\nworse acts of violence unless I count as such our intermissional rushes\nto Pynsent's of the Avenue, a few doors off, in the particular interest\nof a confection that ran the waffle close, as the phrase is, for\npopularity, while even surpassing it for stickiness. Pynsent's was\nhigher up in the row in which Forest's had its front--other and dearer\nnames have dropped from me, but Pynsent's adheres with all the force of\nthe strong saccharine principle. This principle, at its highest, we\nconceived, was embodied in small amber-coloured mounds of chopped\ncocoanut or whatever other substance, if a finer there be; profusely,\nlusciously endued and distributed on small tin trays in the manner of\nhaycocks in a field. We acquired, we appropriated, we transported, we\nenjoyed them, they fairly formed perhaps, after all, our highest\nenjoyment; but with consequences to our pockets--and I speak of those\nother than financial, with an intimacy, a reciprocity of contact at any,\nor at every, personal point, that I lose myself in the thought of.\n\n\n\n\nXVII\n\n\nI lose myself, of a truth, under the whole pressure of the spring of\nmemory proceeding from recent revisitings and recognitions--the action\nof the fact that time until lately had spared hereabouts, and may still\nbe sparing, in the most exceptional way, by an anomaly or a mercy of the\nrarest in New York, a whole cluster of landmarks, leaving me to \"spot\"\nand verify, right and left, the smallest preserved particulars. These\nthings, at the pressure, flush together again, interweave their pattern\nand quite thrust it at me, the absurd little fusion of images, for a\nhistory or a picture of the time--the background of which I see after\nall so much less as the harsh Sixth Avenue corner than as many other\nmatters. Those scant shades claimed us but briefly and superficially,\nand it comes back to me that oddly enough, in the light of autumn\nafternoons, our associates, the most animated or at any rate the best\n\"put in\" little figures of our landscape, were not our comparatively\nobscure schoolmates, who seem mostly to have swum out of our ken between\nany day and its morrow. Our other companions, those we practically knew\n\"at home,\" ignored our school, having better or worse of their own, but\npeopled somehow for us the social scene, which, figuring there for me in\ndocumentary vividness, bristles with Van Burens, Van Winkles, De\nPeysters, Costers, Senters, Norcoms, Robinsons (these last composing\nround a stone-throwing \"Eugene,\") Wards, Hunts and _tutti quanti_--to\nwhose ranks I must add our invariable Albert, before-mentioned, and who\nswarm from up and down and east and west, appearing to me surely to have\nformed a rich and various society. Our salon, it is true, was mainly the\nstreet, loose and rude and crude in those days at best--though with a\nrapid increase of redeeming features, to the extent to which the spread\nof micaceous brown stone could redeem: as exhibited especially in the\nample face of the Scotch Presbyterian church promptly rising just\nopposite our own peculiar row and which it now marks for me somewhat\ngrimly a span of life to have seen laboriously rear itself, continuously\nflourish and utterly disappear. While in construction it was only less\ninteresting than the dancing-academy of Mr. Edward Ferrero, slightly\nwest of it and forming with it, in their embryonic stage, a large and\ndelightfully dangerous adjunct to our playground, though with the\ndistinction of coming much to surpass it for interest in the final\nphase. While we clambered about on ladders and toyed with the peril of\nunfloored abysses, while we trespassed and pried and pervaded,\nsnatching a scant impression from sorry material enough, clearly, the\nsacred edifice enjoyed a credit beyond that of the profane; but when\nboth were finished and opened we flocked to the sound of the fiddle more\nfreely, it need scarce be said, than to that of the psalm. \"Freely\"\nindeed, in our particular case, scarce expresses the latter relation;\nsince our young liberty in respect to church-going was absolute and we\nmight range at will, through the great city, from one place of worship\nand one form of faith to another, or might on occasion ignore them all\nequally, which was what we mainly did; whereas we rallied without a\nbreak to the halls of Ferrero, a view of the staringly and, as I\nsupposed dazzlingly, frescoed walls, the internal economy, the high\namenity, the general \u00c3\u00a6sthetic and social appeal, of which still hangs in\nits wealth before me. Dr. McElroy, uplifting tight-closed eyes, strange\nlong-drawn accents and gaunt scraggy chin, squirming and swaying and\ncushion-thumping in _his_ only a shade more chastely adorned temple, is\ndistinct enough too--just as we enjoyed this bleak intensity the more,\nto my personal vision, through the vague legend (and no legend was too\nvague for me to cherish) of his being the next pastor in succession to\nthe one under whom our mother, thereto predirected by our good\ngreatgrandfather, Alexander Robertson already named, who was nothing if\nnot Scotch and Presbyterian and authoritative, as his brave old portrait\nby the elder Jarves attests, had \"sat\" before her marriage; the marriage\nso lamentedly diverting her indeed from this tradition that, to mark the\nrueful rupture, it had invoked, one evening, with the aid of India\nmuslin and a wondrous gold headband, in the maternal, the Washington\nSquare \"parlours,\" but the secular nuptial consecration of the then\nMayor of the city--I think Mr. Varick.\n\nWe progeny were of course after this mild convulsion not at all in the\nfold; yet it strikes me as the happy note of a simple age that we were\npractically, of a Sunday at least, wherever we might have chosen to\nenter: since, going forth hand in hand into the sunshine (and I connect\nmyself here with my next younger, not with my elder, brother, whose\norbit was other and larger) we sampled, in modern phrase, as small\nunprejudiced inquirers obeying their inspiration, any resort of any\ncongregation detected by us; doing so, I make out moreover, with a sense\nof earnest provision for any contemporary challenge. \"What church do you\ngo to?\"--the challenge took in childish circles that searching form; of\nthe form it took among our elders my impression is more vague. To which\nI must add as well that our \"fending\" in this fashion for ourselves\ndidn't so prepare us for invidious remark--remark I mean upon our\npewless state, which involved, to my imagination, much the same\ndiscredit that a houseless or a cookless would have done--as to hush in\nmy breast the appeal to our parents, not for religious instruction (of\nwhich we had plenty, and of the most charming and familiar) but simply\nfor instruction (a very different thing) as to where we should say we\n\"went,\" in our world, under cold scrutiny or derisive comment. It was\ncolder than any criticism, I recall, to hear our father reply that we\ncould plead nothing less than the whole privilege of Christendom and\nthat there was no communion, even that of the Catholics, even that of\nthe Jews, even that of the Swedenborgians, from which we need find\nourselves excluded. With the freedom we enjoyed our dilemma clearly\namused him: it would have been impossible, he affirmed, to be\ntheologically more _en r\u00c3\u00a8gle_. How as mere detached unaccompanied\ninfants we enjoyed such impunity of range and confidence of welcome is\nbeyond comprehension save by the light of the old manners and\nconditions, the old local bonhomie, the comparatively primal innocence,\nthe absence of complications; with the several notes of which last\nbeatitude my reminiscence surely shines. It was the theory of the time\nand place that the young, were they but young enough, could take\npublicly no harm; to which adds itself moreover, and touchingly enough,\nall the difference of the old importances. It wasn't doubtless that the\nsocial, or call it simply the human, position of the child was higher\nthan to-day--a circumstance not conceivable; it was simply that other\ndignities and values and claims, other social and human positions, were\nless definite and settled, less prescriptive and absolute. A rich\nsophistication is after all a gradual growth, and it would have been\nsophisticated to fear for us, before such bright and vacant vistas, the\nperils of the way or to see us received anywhere even with the irony of\npatronage. We hadn't in fact seats of honour, but that justice was done\nus--that is that we were placed to our advantage--I infer from my having\nliked so to \"go,\" even though my grounds may have been but the love of\nthe _exhibition_ in general, thanks to which figures, faces, furniture,\nsounds, smells and colours became for me, wherever enjoyed, and enjoyed\nmost where most collected, a positive little orgy of the senses and riot\nof the mind. Let me at the same time make the point that--such may be\nthe snobbery of extreme youth--I not only failed quite to rise to the\nparental reasoning, but made out in it rather a certain sophistry; such\na prevarication for instance as if we had habitually said we kept the\ncarriage we observably didn't keep, kept it because we sent when we\nwanted one to University Place, where Mr. Hathorn had his\nlivery-stable: a connection, this last, promoted by my father's\nfrequent need of the aid to circulate (his walks were limited through an\ninjury received in youth) and promoting in turn and at a touch, to my\nconsciousness, the stir of small, the smallest remembered things. I\nrecall the adventure, no infrequent one, of being despatched to Mr.\nHathorn to bespeak a conveyance, and the very air and odour, the genial\nwarmth, at a fine steaming Irish pitch, of the stables and their\nstamping and backing beasts, their resounding boardedness, their chairs\ntipped up at such an angle for lifted heels, a pair of which latter seek\nthe floor again, at my appeal, as those of big bearded Mr. Hathorn\nhimself: an impression enriched by the drive home in lolling and bumping\npossession of the great vehicle and associated further with Sunday\nafternoons in spring, with the question of distant Harlem and remoter\nBloomingdale, with the experience at one of these junctures of far-away\nHoboken, if it wasn't Williamsburg, which fits in fancifully somewhere;\nwhen the carriage was reinforced by a ferry and the ferry by something,\nsomething to my present vision very dim and dusty and archaic, something\nquite ragged and graceless, in the nature of a public tea-garden and\nices. The finest link here, however, is, for some reason, with the New\nYork Hotel, and thereby with Albany uncles; thereby also with Mr.\nHathorn in person waiting and waiting expensively on his box before the\nhouse and somehow felt as attuned to Albany uncles even as Mrs. Cannon\nhad subtly struck me as being.\n\nIntenser than these vague shades meanwhile is my vision of the halls of\nFerrero--where the orgy of the senses and even the riot of the mind, of\nwhich I have just spoken, must quite literally have led me more of a\ndance than anywhere. Let this sketch of a lost order note withal that\nunder so scant a general provision for infant exercise, as distinguished\nfrom infant ease, our hopping and sliding in tune had to be deemed\nurgent. It was the sense for this form of relief that clearly was\ngeneral, superseding as the ampler Ferrero scene did previous limited\nexhibitions; even those, for that matter, coming back to me in the\nancient person of M. Charriau--I guess at the writing of his name--whom\nI work in but confusedly as a professional visitor, a subject gaped at\nacross a gulf of fear, in one of our huddled schools; all the more that\nI perfectly evoke him as resembling, with a difference or two, the\nportraits of the aged Voltaire, and that he had, fiddle in hand and\n_jarret tendu_, incited the young agility of our mother and aunt. Edward\nFerrero was another matter; in the prime of life, good-looking, romantic\nand moustachio'd, he was suddenly to figure, on the outbreak of the\nCivil War, as a General of volunteers--very much as if he had been one\nof Bonaparte's improvised young marshals; in anticipation of which,\nhowever, he wasn't at all fierce or superior, to my remembrance, but\nmost kind to sprawling youth, in a charming man of the world fashion and\nas if _we_ wanted but a touch to become also men of the world.\nRemarkably good-looking, as I say, by the measure of that period, and\nextraordinarily agile--he could so gracefully leap and bound that his\nbounding into the military saddle, such occasion offering, had all the\nfelicity, and only wanted the pink fleshings, of the circus--he was\nstill more admired by the mothers, with whom he had to my eyes a most\nelegant relation, than by the pupils; among all of whom, at the frequent\nand delightful soir\u00c3\u00a9es, he caused trays laden with lucent syrups\nrepeatedly to circulate. The scale of these entertainments, as I figured\nit, and the florid frescoes, just damp though they were with newness,\nand the free lemonade, and the freedom of remark, equally great, with\nthe mothers, were the lavish note in him--just as the fact that he never\nhimself fiddled, but was followed, over the shining parquet, by\nattendant fiddlers, represented doubtless a shadow the less on his later\ndignity, so far as that dignity was compassed. Dignity marked in full\nmeasure even at the time the presence of his sister Madame Dubreuil, a\nhandsome authoritative person who instructed us equally, in fact\npreponderantly, and who, though comparatively not sympathetic, so\nengaged, physiognomically, my wondering interest, that I hear to this\nhour her shrill Franco-American accent: \"Don't look at _me_, little\nboy--look at my feet.\" I see them now, these somewhat fat members,\nbeneath the uplifted skirt, encased in \"bronzed\" slippers, without heels\nbut attached, by graceful cross-bands over her white stockings, to her\nsolid ankles--an emphatic sign of the time; not less than I recover my\nsurprised sense of their supporting her without loss of balance,\nsubstantial as she was, in the \"first position\"; her command of which,\nher ankles clapped close together and her body very erect, was so\nperfect that even with her toes, right and left, fairly turning the\ncorner backward, she never fell prone on her face.\n\nIt consorted somehow with this wealth of resource in her that she\nappeared at the soir\u00c3\u00a9es, or at least at the great fancy-dress soir\u00c3\u00a9e in\nwhich the historic truth of my experience, free lemonade and all, is\ndoubtless really shut up, as the \"genius of California,\" a dazzling\nvision of white satin and golden flounces--her brother meanwhile\nmaintaining that more distinctively European colour which I feel to have\nbeen for my young presumption the convincing essence of the scene in the\ncharacter of a mousquetaire de Louis Quinze, highly consonant with his\ntype. There hovered in the background a flushed, full-chested and\ntawnily short-bearded M. Dubreuil, who, as a singer of the heavy order,\nat the Opera, carried us off into larger things still--the Opera having\nat last about then, after dwelling for years, down town, in shifty tents\nand tabernacles, set up its own spacious pavilion and reared its head as\nthe Academy of Music: all at the end, or what served for the end, of our\nvery street, where, though it wasn't exactly near and Union Square\nbristled between, I could yet occasionally gape at the great bills\nbeside the portal, in which M. Dubreuil always so serviceably came in at\nthe bottom of the cast. A subordinate artist, a \"grand utility\" at the\nbest, I believe, and presently to become, on that scene, slightly ragged\nI fear even in its freshness, permanent stage-manager or, as we say\nnowadays, producer, he had yet eminently, to my imagination, the richer,\nthe \"European\" value; especially for instance when our air thrilled, in\nthe sense that our attentive parents re-echoed, with the visit of the\ngreat Grisi and the great Mario, and I seemed, though the art of\nadvertisement was then comparatively so young and so chaste, to see our\npersonal acquaintance, as he could almost be called, thickly sandwiched\nbetween them. Such was one's strange sense for the connections of things\nthat they drew out the halls of Ferrero till these too seemed fairly to\nresound with Norma and Lucrezia Borgia, as if opening straight upon the\nstage, and Europe, by the stroke, had come to us in such force that we\nhad but to enjoy it on the spot. That could never have been more the\ncase than on the occasion of my assuming, for the famous fancy-ball--not\nat the operatic Academy, but at the dancing-school, which came so nearly\nto the same thing--the dress of a d\u00c3\u00a9bardeur, whatever that might be,\nwhich carried in its puckered folds of dark green relieved with scarlet\nand silver such an exotic fragrance and appealed to me by such a legend.\nThe legend had come round to us, it was true, by way of Albany, whence\nwe learned at the moment of our need, that one of the adventures, one of\nthe least lamentable, of our cousin Johnny had been his figuring as a\nd\u00c3\u00a9bardeur at some Parisian revel; the elegant evidence of which, neatly\npacked, though with but vague instructions for use, was helpfully sent\non to us. The instructions for use were in fact so vague that I was\nafterward to become a bit ruefully conscious of having sadly\ndishonoured, or at least abbreviated, my model. I fell, that is I stood,\nshort of my proper form by no less than half a leg; the essence of the\nd\u00c3\u00a9bardeur being, it appeared, that he emerged at the knees, in white\nsilk stockings and with neat calves, from the beribboned breeches which\nI artlessly suffered to flap at my ankles. The discovery, after the\nfact, was disconcerting--yet had been best made withal, too late; for\nit would have seemed, I conceive, a less monstrous act to attempt to\nlengthen my legs than to shorten Johnny's _culotte_. The trouble had\nbeen that we hadn't really known what a d\u00c3\u00a9bardeur _was_, and I am not\nsure indeed that I know to this day. It had been more fatal still that\neven fond Albany couldn't tell us.\n\n\n\n\nXVIII\n\n\nI have nevertheless the memory of a restless relish of all that time--by\nwhich I mean of those final months of New York, even with so scant a\nrecord of other positive successes to console me. I had but one success,\nalways--that of endlessly supposing, wondering, admiring: I was sunk in\nthat luxury, which had never yet been so great, and it might well make\nup for anything. It made up perfectly, and more particularly as the\nstopgap as which I have already defined it, for the scantness of the\nperiod immediately round us; since how could I have wanted richer when\nthe limits of reality, as I advanced upon them, seemed ever to recede\nand recede? It is true that but the other day, on the scene revisited, I\nwas to be struck rather as by their weird immobility: there on the north\nside, still untenanted after sixty years, a tremendous span in the life\nof New York, was the vacant lot, undiminished, in which a friendly goat\nor two used to browse, whom we fed perversely with scraps of paper, just\nas perversely appreciated indeed, through the relaxed wooden palings.\nThere hovers for me an impression of the glass roofs of a florist, a\nsuffered squatter for a while; but florists and goats have alike\ndisappeared and the barrenness of the place is as sordid as only\nuntended gaps in great cities can seem. One of its boundaries, however,\nstill breathes associations--the home of the Wards, the more eastward of\na pair of houses then and still isolated has remained the same through\nall vicissitudes, only now quite shabbily mellow and, like everything\nelse, much smaller than one had remembered it; yet this too without\nprejudice to the large, the lustrous part played in our prospect by that\ninteresting family. I saddle their mild memory a bit \"subjectively\"\nperhaps with the burden of that character--making out that they were\ninteresting really in spite of themselves and as unwittingly as M.\nJourdain expressed himself in prose; owing their wild savour as they did\nto that New England stamp which we took to be strong upon them and no\nother exhibition of which we had yet enjoyed. It made them different,\nmade them, in their homely grace, rather aridly romantic: I pored in\nthose days over the freshness of the Franconia Stories of the brothers\nAbbott, then immediately sequent to the sweet Rollo series and even more\nadmired; and there hung about the Wards, to my sense, that atmosphere of\napples and nuts and cheese, of pies and jack-knives and \"squrruls,\" of\ndomestic Bible-reading and attendance at \"evening lecture,\" of the fear\nof parental discipline and the cultivated art of dodging it, combined\nwith great personal toughness and hardihood, an almost envied liability\nto warts on hard brown hands, a familiarity with garments domestically\nwrought, a brave rusticity in short that yet hadn't prevented the\nannexation of whole tracts of town life unexplored by ourselves and\nachieved by the brothers since their relatively recent migration from\nConnecticut--which State in general, with the city of Hartford in\nparticular, hung as a hazy, fruity, rivery background, the very essence\nof Indian summer, in the rear of their discourse. Three in number,\nJohnny and Charley and Freddy, with castigating elders, even to the\nsecond and third generation back, dimly discerned through closed\nwindow-panes, they didn't at all haunt the halls of Ferrero--it was a\npart of their homely grace and their social tone, if not of their want\nof the latter, that this couldn't in the least be in question for them;\non the other hand they frequented, Charley and Freddy at least, the Free\nSchool, which was round in Thirteenth Street--Johnny, the eldest, having\nentered the Free Academy, an institution that loomed large to us and\nthat I see as towered or castellated or otherwise impressively\nembellished in vague vignettes, in stray representations, perhaps only\nof the grey schoolbook order, which are yet associated for me with those\nfond images of lovely ladies, \"hand-painted,\" decorating at either end\nthe interior of the old omnibusses. We must have been in relation with\nno other feeders at the public trough of learning--I can't account\notherwise for the glamour as of envied privilege and strange experience\nthat surrounded the Wards; they mixed, to the great sharpening of the\nedge of their wit, in the wild life _of_ the people, beside which the\nlife at Mr. Pulling Jenks's and even at the Institution Vergn\u00c3\u00a8s was\ncolourless and commonplace. Somehow they were of the people, and still\nwere full of family forms--which seemed, one dimly made out through the\nfalse perspective of all the cousinships, the stronger and clearer note\nof New England; the note that had already determined a shy yearning\nunder perusal of the Rollo and Franconia chronicles. The special mark of\nthese friends was perhaps however that of being socially young while\nthey were annually old; little Freddy in particular, very short, very\ninured and very popular, though less curiously wrinkled about eyes and\nmouth than Charley, confessed to monstrous birthdays even while\ncrouching or hopping, even while racing or roaring, as a high\nsuperiority in the games of the street prescribed. It was to strike me\nlater on, when reading or hearing of young Americans of those parts who\nhad turned \"hard\" or reckless by reaction from excessive discipline,\ntheologic and economic, and had gone to sea or to California or to the\n\"bad,\" that Freddy and Charley were typical of the race, even if their\nfortunes had taken, as I hoped, a happier form. That, I said to myself\nfor the interest of it, _that_, the stuff of the Wards, their homely\ngrace, was all New England--so far at least as New England wasn't\nEmerson and Margaret Fuller and Mr. Channing and the \"best Boston\"\nfamilies. Such, in small very plastic minds, is the intensity, if not\nthe value, of early impressions.\n\nAnd yet how can such visions not have paled in the southern glow of the\nNorcoms, who had lately arrived _en masse_ from Louisville and had\nimprovised a fine old Kentucky home in the last house of our row--the\none to be occupied so differently, after their strange and precipitate\nflight, as I dimly make out, by the Ladies of the Sacred Heart; those\nwho presently, if I mistake not, moved out to Bloomingdale, if they were\nnot already in part established there. Next us westward were the Ogdens,\nthree slim and fair sisters, who soared far above us in age and general\namenity; then came the Van Winkles, two sisters, I think, and a\nbrother--he much the most serious and judicious, as well as the most\neducated, of our friends; and so at last the Norcoms, during their brief\nbut concentrated, most vivid and momentous, reign, a matter, as I recall\nit, of a couple of breathless winters. We were provided by their\npresence with as happy a foil as we could have wished to the plainness\nand dryness of the Wards; their homely grace was all their own and was\nalso embodied in three brothers, Eugene, Reginald, Albert, whose ages\nwould have corresponded, I surmise, with those of Johnny, Charley and\nFreddy if these latter hadn't, in their way, as I have hinted, defied\nany close notation. Elder sons--there were to my recollection no\ndaughters--moved too as with their heads in the clouds; notably\n\"Stiffy,\" eldest of all, whom we supposed gorgeous, who affected us as\nsublime and unapproachable and to whom we thus applied the term in use\namong us before we had acquired for reference to such types the notion\nof the _nuance_, the dandy, the dude, the masher. (Divided I was, I\nrecall, between the dread and the glory of being so greeted, \"Well,\nStiffy--!\" as a penalty of the least attempt at personal adornment.) The\nhigher intensity for our sense of the Norcoms came from the large, the\nlavish, ease of their hospitality; whereas our intercourse with the\nWards was mainly in the street or at most the \"yard\"--and it was a\nwonder how intimacy _could_ to that degree consort with publicity. A\nglazed southern gallery, known to its occupants as the \"poo'ch\" and to\nthe rake of which their innermost penetralia seemed ever to stand open,\nencompasses my other memories. Everything took place on the poo'ch,\nincluding the free, quite the profuse, consumption of hot cakes and\nmolasses, including even the domestic manufacture of sausages, testified\nto by a strange machine that was worked like a handorgan and by the\ncasual halves, when not the wholes, of stark stiff hogs fresh from\nKentucky stores. We must have been for a time constantly engaged with\nthis delightful group, who never ceased to welcome us or to feed us, and\nyet of the presence of whose members under other roofs than their own,\nby a return of hospitality received, I retain no image. They didn't\ncount and didn't grudge--the sausage-mill kept turning and the molasses\nflowing for all who came; that was the expression of their southern\ngrace, especially embodied in Albert, my exact contemporary and chosen\nfriend (Reggie had but crushed my fingers under the hinge of a closing\ndoor, the mark of which act of inadvertence I was to carry through\nlife,) who had profuse and tightly-crinkled hair, and the moral of whose\nqueer little triangular brown teeth, casting verily a shade on my\nattachment to him, was pointed for me, not by himself, as the error of a\nKentucky diet.\n\nThe great Kentucky error, however, had been the introduction into a free\nState of two pieces of precious property which our friends were to fail\nto preserve, the pair of affectionate black retainers whose presence\ncontributed most to their exotic note. We revelled in the fact that Davy\nand Aunt Sylvia (pronounced An'silvy,) a light-brown lad with\nextraordinarily shining eyes and his straight, grave, deeper-coloured\nmother, not radiant as to anything but her vivid turban, had been born\nand kept in slavery of the most approved pattern and such as this\nintensity of their condition made them a joy, a joy to the curious mind,\nto consort with. Davy mingled in our sports and talk, he enriched, he\nadorned them with a personal, a pictorial lustre that none of us could\nemulate, and servitude in the absolute thus did more for him socially\nthan we had ever seen done, above stairs or below, for victims of its\nlighter forms. What was not our dismay therefore when we suddenly\nlearnt--it must have blown right up and down the street--that mother and\nson had fled, in the dead of night, from bondage? had taken advantage of\ntheir visit to the North simply to leave the house and not return,\ncovering their tracks, successfully disappearing. They had never been\nfor us so beautifully slaves as in this achievement of their freedom;\nfor they did brilliantly achieve it--they escaped, on northern soil,\nbeyond recall or recovery. I think we had already then, on the spot, the\nsense of some degree of presence at the making of history; the question\nof what persons of colour and of their condition might or mightn't do\nwas intensely in the air; this was exactly the season of the freshness\nof Mrs. Stowe's great novel. It must have come out at the moment of our\nfondest acquaintance with our neighbours, though I have no recollection\nof hearing them remark upon it--any remark they made would have been\nsure to be so strong. I suspect they hadn't read it, as they certainly\nwouldn't have allowed it in the house; any more indeed than they had\nread or were likely ever to read any other work of fiction; I doubt\nwhether the house contained a printed volume, unless its head had had in\nhand a law-book or so: I to some extent recover Mr. Norcom as a lawyer\nwho had come north on important, difficult business, on contentious,\nprecarious grounds--a large bald political-looking man, very loose and\nungirt, just as his wife was a desiccated, depressed lady who mystified\nme by always wearing her nightcap, a feebly-frilled but tightly-tied and\nunmistakable one, and the compass of whose maternal figure beneath a\nlarge long collarless cape or mantle defined imperfectly for me of\ncourse its connection with the further increase of Albert's little\nbrothers and sisters, there being already, by my impression, two or\nthree of these in the background. Had Davy and An'silvy at least read\nUncle Tom?--that question might well come up for us, with the certainty\nat any rate that they ignored him less than their owners were doing.\nThese latter good people, who had been so fond of their humble\ndependents and supposed this affection returned, were shocked at such\ningratitude, though I remember taking a vague little inward Northern\ncomfort in their inability, in their discreet decision, not to raise the\nhue and cry. Wasn't one even just dimly aware of the heavy hush that, in\nthe glazed gallery, among the sausages and the johnny-cakes, had\nfollowed the first gasp of resentment? I think the honest Norcoms were\nin any case astonished, let alone being much incommoded; just as _we_\nwere, for that matter, when the genial family itself, installed so at\nits ease, failed us with an effect of abruptness, simply ceased, in\ntheir multitude, to be there. I don't remember their going, nor any\npangs of parting; I remember only knowing with wonderment that they had\ngone, that obscurity had somehow engulfed them; and how afterwards, in\nthe light of later things, memory and fancy attended them, figured their\nhistory as the public complication grew and the great intersectional\nplot thickened; felt even, absurdly and disproportionately, that they\nhad helped one to \"know Southerners.\" The slim, the sallow, the\nstraight-haired and dark-eyed Eugene in particular haunted my\nimagination; he had not been my comrade of election--he was too much my\nsenior; but I cherished the thought of the fine fearless young\nfire-eater he would have become and, when the War had broken out, I know\nnot what dark but pitying vision of him stretched stark after a battle.\n\nAll of which sounds certainly like a meagre range--which heaven knows it\nwas; but with a plea for the several attics, already glanced at, and the\npositive \u00c3\u00a6sthetic reach that came to us through those dim resorts, quite\nworth making. They were scattered and they constituted on the part of\nsuch of our friends as had license to lead us up to them a ground of\nauthority and glory proportioned exactly to the size of the field. This\nextent was at cousin Helen's, with a large house and few inmates, vast\nand free, so that no hospitality, under the eaves, might have matched\nthat offered us by the young Albert--if only that heir of all the ages\nhad had rather more imagination. He had, I think, as little as was\npossible--which would have counted in fact for an unmitigated blank had\nnot W. J., among us, on that spot and elsewhere, supplied this motive\nforce in any quantity required. He imagined--that was the point--the\ncomprehensive comedies we were to prepare and to act; comprehensive by\nthe fact that each one of us, even to the God-fearing but\nsurreptitiously law-breaking Wards, was in fairness to be enabled to\nfigure. Not one of us but was somehow to be provided with a part, though\nI recall my brother as the constant comic star. The attics were thus in\na word our respective temples of the drama--temples in which the stage,\nthe green-room and the wardrobe, however, strike me as having consumed\nmost of our margin. I remember, that is, up and down the street--and the\nassociation is mainly with its far westward reaches--so much more\npreparation than performance, so much more conversation and costume than\nactive rehearsal, and, on the part of some of us, especially doubtless\non my own, so much more eager denudation, both of body and mind, than of\nachieved or inspired assumption. We shivered unclad and impatient both\nas to our persons and to our aims, waiting alike for ideas and for\nbreeches; we were supposed to make our dresses no less than to create\nour characters, and our material was in each direction apt to run short.\nI remember how far ahead of us my brother seemed to keep, announcing a\n\"motive,\" producing a figure, throwing off into space conceptions that I\ncould stare at across the interval but couldn't appropriate; so that my\nvision of him in these connections is not so much of his coming toward\nme, or toward any of us, as of his moving rapidly away in fantastic garb\nand with his back turned, as if to perform to some other and more\nassured public. There were indeed other publics, publics downstairs, who\nglimmer before me seated at the open folding-doors of ancient parlours,\nbut all from the point of view of an absolute supernumerary, more or\nless squashed into the wing but never coming on. Who were the copious\nHunts?--whose ample house, on the north side, toward Seventh Avenue,\nstill stands, next or near that of the De Peysters, so that I perhaps\nconfound some of the attributes of each, though clear as to the blond\nBeekman, or \"Beek,\" of the latter race, not less than to the robust\nGeorge and the stout, the very stout, Henry of the former, whom I see\nbounding before a gathered audience for the execution of a _pas seul_,\nclad in a garment of \"Turkey red\" fashioned by his own hands and giving\nway at the seams, to a complete absence of _dessous_, under the strain\nof too fine a figure: this too though I make out in those connections,\nthat is in the twilight of Hunt and De Peyster garrets, our command of a\ncomparative welter of draperies; so that I am reduced to the surmise\nthat Henry indeed had contours.\n\nI recover, further, some sense of the high places of the Van Winkles,\nbut think of them as pervaded for us by the upper air of the\nproprieties, the proprieties that were so numerous, it would appear,\nwhen once one had had a glimpse of them, rather than by the crude fruits\nof young improvisation. Wonderful must it clearly have been still to fed\namid laxities and vaguenesses such a difference of _milieux_ and, as\nthey used to say, of atmospheres. This was a word of those\ndays--atmospheres were a thing to recognise and cultivate, for people\nreally wanted them, gasped for them; which was why they took them, on\nthe whole, on easy terms, never exposing them, under an apparent flush,\nto the last analysis. Did we at any rate really vibrate to one social\ntone after another, or are these adventures for me now but fond\nimaginations? No, we vibrated--or I'll be hanged, as I may say, if _I_\ndidn't; little as I could tell it or may have known it, little as anyone\nelse may have known. There were shades, after all, in our democratic\norder; in fact as I brood back to it I recognise oppositions the\nsharpest, contrasts the most intense. It wasn't given to us all to have\na social tone, but the Costers surely had one and kept it in constant\nuse; whereas the Wards, next door to them, were possessed of no approach\nto any, and indeed had the case been other, had they had such a\nconsciousness, would never have employed it, would have put it away on a\nhigh shelf, as they put the last-baked pie, out of Freddy's and\nCharley's reach--heaven knows what _they_ two would have done with it.\nThe Van Winkles on the other hand were distinctly so provided, but with\nthe special note that their provision was one, so to express it, with\ntheir educational, their informational, call it even their professional:\nMr. Van Winkle, if I mistake not, was an eminent lawyer, and the note of\nour own house was the absence of any profession, to the quickening of\nour general as distinguished from our special sensibility. There was no\nTurkey red among those particular neighbours at all events, and if there\nhad been it wouldn't have gaped at the seams. I didn't then know it, but\nI sipped at a fount of culture; in the sense, that is, that, our\nconnection with the house being through Edgar, he knew about\nthings--inordinately, as it struck me. So, for that matter, did little\npublic Freddy Ward; but the things one of them knew about differed\nwholly from the objects of knowledge of the other: all of which was\nsplendid for giving one exactly a sense of things. It intimated more and\nmore how many such there would be altogether. And part of the interest\nwas that while Freddy gathered his among the wild wastes Edgar walked in\na regular maze of culture. I didn't then know about culture, but Edgar\nmust promptly have known. This impression was promoted by his moving in\na distant, a higher sphere of study, amid scenes vague to me; I dimly\ndescry him as appearing at Jenks's and vanishing again, as if even that\nhadn't been good enough--though I may be here at fault, and indeed can\nscarce say on what arduous heights I supposed him, as a day-scholar, to\ndwell. I took the unknown always easily for the magnificent and was sure\nonly of the limits of what I saw. It wasn't that the boys swarming for\nus at school were not often, to my vision, unlimited, but that those\npeopling our hours of ease, as I have already noted, were almost\ninveterately so--they seemed to describe always, out of view, so much\nlarger circles. I linger thus on Edgar by reason of its having somehow\nseemed to us that he described--was it at Doctor Anthon's?--the largest\nof all. If there was a bigger place than Doctor Anthon's it was there he\nwould have been. I break down, as to the detail of the matter, in any\npush toward vaster suppositions. But let me cease to stir this\nimponderable dust.\n\n\n\n\nXIX\n\n\nI try at least to recover here, however, some closer notation of W. J.'s\naspects--yet only with the odd effect of my either quite losing him or\nbut apprehending him again at seated play with his pencil under the\nlamp. When I see him he is intently, though summarily, rapidly drawing,\nhis head critically balanced and his eyebrows working, and when I don't\nsee him it is because I have resignedly relinquished him. I can't have\nbeen often for him a deprecated, still less an actively rebuffed suitor,\nbecause, as I say again, such aggressions were so little in order for\nme; but I remember that on my once offering him my company in\nconditions, those of some planned excursion, in which it wasn't desired,\nhis putting the question of our difference at rest, with the minimum of\nexplanation, by the responsible remark: \"_I_ play with boys who curse\nand swear!\" I had sadly to recognise that I didn't, that I couldn't\npretend to have come to that yet--and truly, as I look back, either the\nunadvisedness and inexpertness of my young contemporaries on all that\nground must have been complete (an interesting note on our general\nmanners after all,) or my personal failure to grasp must have been.\nBesides which I wonder scarce less now than I wondered then in just what\ncompany my brother's privilege was exercised; though if he had but\nrichly wished to be discouraging he quite succeeded. It wasn't that I\nmightn't have been drawn to the boys in question, but that I simply\nwasn't qualified. All boys, I rather found, were difficult to play\nwith--unless it was that they rather found _me_; but who would have been\nso difficult as these? They account but little, moreover, I make out,\nfor W. J.'s eclipses; so that I take refuge easily enough in the memory\nof my own pursuits, absorbing enough at times to have excluded other\nviews. I also plied the pencil, or to be more exact the pen--even if\nneither implement critically, rapidly or summarily. I was so often\nengaged at that period, it strikes me, in literary--or, to be more\nprecise in dramatic, accompanied by pictorial composition--that I must\nagain and again have delightfully lost myself. I had not on any occasion\npersonally succeeded, amid our theatric strife, in reaching the\nfootlights; but how could I have doubted, nevertheless, with our large\ntheatrical experience, of the nature, and of my understanding, of the\ndramatic form? I sacrificed to it with devotion--by the aid of certain\nquarto sheets of ruled paper bought in Sixth Avenue for the purpose (my\nfather's store, though I held him a great fancier of the article in\ngeneral, supplied but the unruled;) grateful in particular for the happy\nprovision by which each fourth page of the folded sheet was left blank.\nWhen the drama itself had covered three pages the last one, over which I\nmost laboured, served for the illustration of what I had verbally\npresented. Every scene had thus its explanatory picture, and as each\nact--though I am not positively certain I arrived at acts--would have\nhad its vivid climax. Addicted in that degree to fictive evocation, I\nyet recall, on my part, no practice whatever of narrative prose or any\nsort of verse. I cherished the \"scene\"--as I had so vibrated to the idea\nof it that evening at Linwood; I thought, I lisped, at any rate I\ncomposed, in scenes; though how much, or how far, the scenes \"came\" is\nanother affair. Entrances, exits, the indication of \"business,\" the\nanimation of dialogue, the multiplication of designated characters, were\nthings delightful in themselves--while I panted toward the canvas on\nwhich I should fling my figures; which it took me longer to fill than it\nhad taken me to write what went with it, but which had on the other hand\nsomething of the interest of the dramatist's casting of his _person\u00c3\u00a6_,\nand must have helped me to believe in the validity of my subject.\n\nFrom where on these occasions that subject can have dropped for me I am\nat a loss to say, and indeed have a strong impression that I didn't at\nany moment quite know what I was writing about: I am sure I couldn't\notherwise have written so much. With scenes, when I think, what\ncertitude did I want more?--scenes being the root of the matter,\nespecially when they bristled with proper names and noted movements;\nespecially, above all, when they flowered at every pretext into the very\noptic and perspective of the stage, where the boards diverged correctly,\nfrom a central point of vision, even as the lashes from an eyelid,\nstraight down to the footlights. Let this reminiscence remind us of how\nrarely in those days the real stage was carpeted. The difficulty of\ncomposition was naught; the one difficulty was in so placing my figures\non the fourth page that these radiations could be marked without making\nlines through them. The odd part of all of which was that whereas my\ncultivation of the picture was maintained my practice of the play, my\naddiction to scenes, presently quite dropped. I was capable of learning,\nthough with inordinate slowness, to express ideas in scenes, and was not\ncapable, with whatever patience, of making proper pictures; yet I\naspired to this form of design to the prejudice of any other, and long\nafter those primitive hours was still wasting time in attempts at it. I\ncared so much for nothing else, and that vaguely redressed, as to a\npoint, my general failure of acuteness. I nursed the conviction, or at\nleast I tried to, that if my clutch of the pencil or of the watercolour\nbrush should once become intense enough it would make up for other\nweaknesses of grasp--much as that would certainly give it to do. This\nwas a very false scent, which had however the excuse that my brother's\nexample really couldn't but act upon me--the scent was apparently so\ntrue for _him_; from the moment my small \"interest in art,\" that is my\nbent for gaping at illustrations and exhibitions, was absorbing and\ngenuine. There were elements in the case that made it natural: the\npicture, the representative design, directly and strongly appealed to\nme, and was to appeal all my days, and I was only slow to recognise the\n_kind_, in this order, that appealed most. My face was turned from the\nfirst to the idea of representation--that of the gain of charm,\ninterest, mystery, dignity, distinction, gain of importance in fine, on\nthe part of the represented thing (over the thing of accident, of mere\nactuality, still unappropriated;) but in the house of representation\nthere were many chambers, each with its own lock, and long was to be the\nbusiness of sorting and trying the keys. When I at last found deep in my\npocket the one I could more or less work, it was to feel, with\nreassurance, that the picture was still after all in essence one's aim.\nSo there had been in a manner continuity, been not so much waste as one\nhad sometimes ruefully figured; so many wastes are sweetened for memory\nas by the taste of the economy they have led to or imposed and from the\nvantage of which they could scarce look better if they had been current\nand blatant profit. Wasn't the very bareness of the field itself\nmoreover a challenge, in a degree, to design?--not, I mean, that there\nseemed to one's infant eyes too few things to paint: as to that there\nwere always plenty--but for the very reason that there were more than\nanyone noticed, and that a hunger was thus engendered which one cast\nabout to gratify. The gratification nearest home was the imitative, the\nemulative--that is on my part: W. J., I see, needed no reasons, no\nconsciousness other than that of being easily able. So he drew because\nhe could, while I did so in the main only because he did; though I think\nwe cast about, as I say, alike, making the most of every image within\nview. I doubt if he made more than I even then did, though earlier able\nto account for what he made. Afterwards, on other ground and in richer\nair, I admit, the challenge was in the fulness and not in the bareness\nof aspects, with their natural result of hunger appeased; exhibitions,\nillustrations abounded in Paris and London--the reflected image hung\neverywhere about; so that if there we daubed afresh and with more\nconfidence it was not because no-one but because everyone did. In fact\nwhen I call our appetite appeased I speak less of our browsing vision,\nwhich was tethered and insatiable, than of our sense of the quite normal\ncharacter of our own proceedings. In Europe we knew there was Art, just\nas there were soldiers and lodgings and concierges and little boys in\nthe streets who stared at us, especially at our hats and boots, as at\nthings of derision--just as, to put it negatively, there were\npractically no hot rolls and no iced water. Perhaps too, I should add,\nwe didn't enjoy the works of Mr. Benjamin Haydon, then clustered at the\nPantheon in Oxford Street, which in due course became our favourite\nhaunt, so infinitely more, after all, than we had enjoyed those arrayed\nat the D\u00c3\u00bcsseldorf collection in Broadway; whence the huge canvas of the\nMartyrdom of John Huss comes back to me in fact as a revelation of\nrepresentational brightness and charm that pitched once for all in these\nmatters my young sense of what should be.\n\nIneffable, unsurpassable those hours of initiation which the Broadway of\nthe 'fifties had been, when all was said, so adequate to supply. If one\nwanted pictures there _were_ pictures, as large, I seem to remember, as\nthe side of a house, and of a bravery of colour and lustre of surface\nthat I was never afterwards to see surpassed. We were shown without\ndoubt, under our genial law here too, everything there was, and as I\ncast up the items I wonder, I confess, what ampler fare we could have\ndealt with. The D\u00c3\u00bcsseldorf school commanded the market, and I think of\nits exhibition as firmly seated, going on from year to year--New York,\njudging now to such another tune, must have been a brave patron of that\nmanufacture; I believe that scandal even was on occasion not evaded,\nrather was boldly invoked, though of what particular sacrifices to the\npure plastic or undraped shocks to bourgeois prejudice the comfortable\nGerman genius of that period may have been capable history has kept no\nrecord. New accessions, at any rate, vividly new ones, in which the\nfreshness and brightness of the paint, particularly lustrous in our\ncopious light, enhanced from time to time the show, which I have the\nsense of our thus repeatedly and earnestly visiting and which comes back\nto me with some vagueness as installed in a disaffected church, where\ngothic excrescences and an ecclesiastical roof of a mild order helped\nthe importance. No impression here, however, was half so momentous as\nthat of the epoch-making masterpiece of Mr. Leutze, which showed us\nWashington crossing the Delaware in a wondrous flare of projected\ngaslight and with the effect of a revelation to my young sight of the\ncapacity of accessories to \"stand out.\" I live again in the thrill of\nthat evening--which was the greater of course for my feeling it, in my\nparents' company, when I should otherwise have been in bed. We went\ndown, after dinner, in the Fourteenth Street stage, quite as if going to\nthe theatre; the scene of exhibition was near the Stuyvesant Institute\n(a circumstance stirring up somehow a swarm of associations, echoes\nprobably of lectures discussed at home, yet at which my attendance had\ndoubtless conveniently lapsed,) but Mr. Leutze's drama left behind any\npaler proscenium. We gaped responsive to every item, lost in the marvel\nof the wintry light, of the sharpness of the ice-blocks, of the sickness\nof the sick soldier, of the protrusion of the minor objects, that of the\nstrands of the rope and the nails of the boots, that, I say, on the part\nof everything, of its determined purpose of standing out; but that,\nabove all, of the profiled national hero's purpose, as might be said, of\nstanding _up_, as much as possible, even indeed of doing it almost on\none leg, in such difficulties, and successfully balancing. So memorable\nwas that evening to remain for me that nothing could be more strange, in\nconnection with it, than the illustration by the admired work, on its in\nafter years again coming before me, of the cold cruelty with which time\nmay turn and devour its children. The picture, more or less entombed in\nits relegation, was lividly dead--and that was bad enough. But half the\nsubstance of one's youth seemed buried with it. There were other\npictorial evenings, I may add, not all of which had the thrill. Deep the\ndisappointment, on my own part, I remember, at Bryan's Gallery of\nChristian Art, to which also, as for great emotions, we had taken the\nomnibus after dinner. It cast a chill, this collection of worm-eaten\ndiptychs and triptychs, of angular saints and seraphs, of black Madonnas\nand obscure Bambinos, of such marked and approved \"primitives\" as had\nnever yet been shipped to our shores. Mr. Bryan's shipment was presently\nto fall, I believe, under grave suspicion, was to undergo in fact fatal\nexposure; but it appealed at the moment in apparent good faith, and I\nhave not forgotten how, conscious that it was fresh from Europe--\"fresh\"\nwas beautiful in the connection!--I felt that my yearning should all\nhave gone out to it. With that inconsequence to handle I doubt whether I\nproclaimed that it bored me--any more than I have ever noted till now\nthat it made me begin badly with Christian art. I like to think that the\ncollection consisted without abatement of frauds and \"fakes\" and that if\nthese had been honest things my perception wouldn't so have slumbered;\nyet the principle of interest had been somehow compromised, and I think\nI have never since stood before a real Primitive, a primitive of the\nprimitives, without having first to shake off the grey mantle of that\nnight. The main disconcertment had been its ugly twist to the name of\nItaly, already sweet to me for all its dimness--even could dimness have\nprevailed in my felt measure of the pictorial testimony of home,\ntestimony that dropped for us from the ample canvas of Mr. Cole, \"the\nAmerican Turner\" which covered half a side of our front parlour, and in\nwhich, though not an object represented in it began to stand out after\nthe manner of Mr. Leutze, I could always lose myself as soon as look. It\ndepicted Florence from one of the neighbouring hills--I have often since\nwondered which, the picture being long ago lost to our sight; Florence\nwith her domes and towers and old walls, the old walls Mr. Cole had\nengaged for, but which I was ruefully to miss on coming to know and love\nthe place in after years. Then it was I felt how long before my\nattachment had started on its course--that closer vision was no\nbeginning, it only took up the tale; just as it comes to me again\nto-day, at the end of time, that the contemplative monk seated on a\nterrace in the foreground, a constant friend of my childhood, must have\nbeen of the convent of San Miniato, which gives me the site from which\nthe painter wrought. We had Italy again in the corresponding room\nbehind--a great abundance of Italy I was free to think while I revolved\nbetween another large landscape over the sofa and the classic marble\nbust on a pedestal between the two back windows, the figure, a part of\nthe figure, of a lady with her head crowned with vine-leaves and her\nhair disposed with a laxity that was emulated by the front of her dress,\nas my next younger brother exposed himself to my derision by calling the\nbit of brocade (simulated by the chisel) that, depending from a single\nshoulder-strap, so imperfectly covered her. This image was known and\nadmired among us as the Bacchante; she had come to us straight from an\nAmerican studio in Rome, and I see my horizon flush again with the first\nfaint dawn of conscious appreciation, or in other words of the critical\nspirit, while two or three of the more restrictive friends of the house\nfind our marble lady very \"cold\" for a Bacchante. Cold indeed she must\nhave been--quite as of the tombstone temperament; but that objection\nwould drop if she might only be called a Nymph, since nymphs were mild\nand moderate, and since discussion of a work of art mainly hung in those\ndays on that issue of the producible _name_. I fondly recall, by the\nsame token, that playing on a certain occasion over the landscape above\nthe sofa, restrictive criticism, uttered in my indulged hearing,\nintroduced me to what had probably been my very first chance, on such\nground, for active participation. The picture, from the hand of a\nFrench painter, M. Lef\u00c3\u00a8vre, and of but slightly scanter extent than the\nwork of Mr. Cole, represented in frank rich colours and as a so-called\n\"view in Tuscany\" a rural scene of some exuberance, a broken and\nprecipitous place, amid mountains and forests, where two or three\nbare-legged peasants or woodmen were engaged, with much emphasis of\nposture, in felling a badly gashed but spreading oak by means of a tense\nrope attached to an upper limb and at which they pulled together.\n\"Tuscany?--are you sure it's Tuscany?\" said the voice of restrictive\ncriticism, that of the friend of the house who in the golden age of the\nprecursors, though we were still pretty much precursors, had lived\nlongest in Italy. And then on my father's challenge of this demur: \"Oh\nin Tuscany, you know, the colours are much softer--there would be a\ncertain haze in the atmosphere.\" \"Why, of course,\" I can hear myself now\nblushingly but triumphantly intermingle--\"the softness and the haze of\nour Florence there: isn't Florence in Tuscany?\" It had to be parentally\nadmitted that Florence was--besides which our friend had been there and\nknew; so that thereafter, within our walls, a certain _malaise_ reigned,\nfor if the Florence was \"like it\" then the Lef\u00c3\u00a8vre couldn't be, and if\nthe Lef\u00c3\u00a8vre was like it then the Florence couldn't: a lapse from old\nconvenience--as from the moment we couldn't name the Lef\u00c3\u00a8vre where were\nwe? All of which it might have been open to me to feel I had uncannily\npromoted.\n\n\n\n\nXX\n\n\nMy own sense of the great matter, meanwhile--that is of our\npossibilities, still more than of our actualities, of Italy in general\nand of Florence in particular--was a perfectly recoverable little\nawareness, as I find, of certain mild soft irregular breathings thence\non the part of an absent pair in whom our parents were closely\ninterested and whose communications, whose Roman, Sorrentine, Florentine\nletters, letters in especial from the Baths of Lucca, kept open, in our\nair, more than any other sweet irritation, that \"question of Europe\"\nwhich was to have after all, in the immediate years, so limited, so\nshortened, a solution. Mary Temple the elder had, early in our\nFourteenth Street period, married Edmund Tweedy, a haunter of that\nneighbourhood and of our house in it from the first, but never more than\nduring a winter spent with us there by that quasi-relative, who, by an\nextension of interest and admiration--she was in those years quite\nexceedingly handsome--ranked for us with the Albany aunts, adding so a\ntwist, as it were, to our tie with the Temple cousins, her own close\nkin. This couple must have been, putting real relatives aside, my\nparents' best friends in Europe, twitching thereby hardest the fine firm\nthread attached at one end to our general desire and at the other to\ntheir supposed felicity. The real relatives, those planted out in the\nsame countries, are a chapter by themselves, whose effect on us, whose\nplace in our vision, I should like to trace: that of the Kings, for\ninstance, of my mother's kin, that of the Masons, of my father's--the\nKings who cultivated, for years, the highest instructional, social and\nmoral possibilities at Geneva, the Masons, above all, less strenuous but\nmore sympathetic, who reported themselves to us hauntingly, during a\nconsiderable period, as enjoying every conceivable _agr\u00c3\u00a9ment_ at Tours\nand at the then undeveloped Trouville, even the winter Trouville, on the\nlowest possible terms. Fain would I, as for the \"mere pleasure\" of it,\nunder the temptation to delineate, gather into my loose net the\nsingularly sharp and rounded image of our cousin Charlotte of the former\nname, who figured for us, on the field of Europe, wherever we looked,\nand all the rest of time, as a character of characters and a marvel of\nplacid consistency; through my vague remembrance of her return from\nChina after the arrest of a commercial career there by her husband's\ndeath in the Red Sea--which somehow sounded like a dreadful form of\ndeath, and my scarce less faint recovery of some Christmas treat of our\nchildhood under her roof in Gramercy Park, amid dim chinoiseries and, in\nthat twilight of time, dimmer offspring, Vernon, Anne, Arthur, marked to\nus always, in the distincter years, as of all our young relatives the\nmost intensely educated and most pointedly proper--an occasion followed\nby her permanent and invidious withdrawal from her own country. I would\nkeep her in my eye through the Genevese age and on to the crisis of the\nCivil War, in which Vernon, unforgiven by her stiff conservatism for his\nNorthern loyalty, laid down before Petersburg a young life of\nunderstanding and pain, uncommemorated as to the gallantry of its\nend--he had insistently returned to the front, after a recovery from\nfirst wounds, as under his mother's malediction--on the stone beneath\nwhich he lies in the old burial ground at Newport, the cradle of his\nfather's family. I should further pursue my subject through other\nperiods and places, other constantly \"quiet\" but vivid exhibitions, to\nthe very end of the story--which for myself was the impression, first,\nof a little lonely, soft-voiced, gentle, relentless lady, in a dull\nSurrey garden of a summer afternoon, more than half blind and all\ndependent on the _dame de compagnie_ who read aloud to her that Saturday\nReview which had ever been the prop and mirror of her opinions and to\nwhich she remained faithful, her children estranged and outworn, dead\nand ignored; and the vision, second and for a climax, of an old-world\nrez-de-chauss\u00c3\u00a9e at Versailles, goal of my final pilgrimage, almost in\npresence of the end (end of her very personal career, I mean, but not of\nher perfectly firm spirit or of her charmingly smooth address).\n\nI confess myself embarrassed by my very ease of re-capture of my young\nconsciousness; so that I perforce try to encourage lapses and keep my\nabundance down. The place for the lapse consents with difficulty,\nhowever, to be _any_ particular point of the past at which I catch\nmyself (easily caught as I am) looking about me; it has certainly\nnothing in common with that coign of vantage enjoyed by me one June\nafternoon of 1855 in the form of the minor share of the box of a\ncarriage that conveyed us for the first time since our babyhood, W. J.'s\nand mine, through so much of a vast portentous London. I was an item in\nthe overflow of a vehicle completely occupied, and I thrilled with the\nspectacle my seat beside the coachman so amply commanded--without\nknowing at this moment why, amid other claims, I had been marked for\nsuch an eminence. I so far justify my privilege at least as still to\nfeel that prime impression, of extreme intensity, underlie, deep down,\nthe whole mass of later observation. There are London aspects which, so\nfar as they still touch me, after all the years, touch me as just\nsensible reminders of this hour of early apprehension, so penetrated for\nme as to have kept its ineffaceable stamp. For at last we had come to\nEurope--we had disembarked at Liverpool, but a couple of days before,\nfrom that steamer Atlantic, of the Collins line, then active but so soon\nto be utterly undone, of which I had kept a romantic note ever since a\ncertain evening of a winter or two before. I had on that occasion\nassisted with my parents at a varied theatrical exhibition--the theatre\nis distinct to me as Brougham's--one of the features of which was the at\nthat time flourishing farce of Betsy Baker, a picture of some\npredicament, supposed droll, of its hero Mr. Mouser, whose wife, if I am\ncorrect, carries on a laundry and controls as she may a train of young\nassistants. A feature of the piece comes back to me as the pursuit of\nMr. Mouser round and round the premises by the troop of laundresses,\nshouting his name in chorus, capture by them being abject, though\nwhether through fear of their endearments or of their harsher violence I\nfail to remember. It was enough that the public nerve had at the moment\nbeen tried by the non-arrival of the Atlantic, several days overdue, to\nthe pitch at last of extreme anxiety; so that, when after the fall of\nthe curtain on the farce the distracted Mr. Mouser, still breathless,\nreappeared at the footlights, where I can see him now abate by his\nplight no jot of the dignity of his announcement, \"Ladies and\ngentlemen, I rejoice to be able to tell you that the good ship Atlantic\nis safe!\" the house broke into such plaudits, so huge and prolonged a\nroar of relief, as I had never heard the like of and which gave me my\nfirst measure of a great immediate public emotion--even as the incident\nitself to-day reminds me of the family-party smallness of the old New\nYork, those happy limits that could make us all care, and care to fond\nvociferation, for the same thing at once. It was a moment of the golden\nage--representing too but a snatch of elation, since the wretched Arctic\nhad gone down in mortal woe and her other companion, the Pacific,\nleaving England a few months later and under the interested eyes of our\nfamily group, then temporarily settled in London, was never heard of\nmore. Let all of which show again what traps are laid about me for\nunguarded acute reminiscence.\n\nI meet another of these, though I positively try to avoid it, in the\nsense of a day spent on the great fusty curtained bed, a medi\u00c3\u00a6val\nfour-poster such as I had never seen, of the hotel at the London and\nNorth-Western station, where it appeared, to our great inconvenience,\nthat I had during the previous months somewhere perversely absorbed\n(probably on Staten Island upwards of a year before) the dull seed of\nmalaria, which now suddenly broke out in chills and fever. This\ncondition, of the intermittent order, hampered our movements but left\nalternate days on which we could travel, and as present to me as ever is\nthe apprehended interest of my important and determinant state and of\nour complicated prospect while I lay, much at my ease--for I recall in\nparticular certain short sweet times when I could be left alone--with\nthe thick and heavy suggestions of the London room about me, the very\nsmell of which was ancient, strange and impressive, a new revelation\naltogether, and the window open to the English June and the far off hum\nof a thousand possibilities. I consciously took them in, these last, and\nmust then, I think, have first tasted the very greatest pleasure perhaps\nI was ever to know--that of almost holding my breath in presence of\ncertain aspects to the end of so taking in. It was as if in those hours\nthat precious fine art had been disclosed to me--scantly as the poor\nplace and the small occasion might have seemed of an order to promote\nit. We seize our property by an avid instinct wherever we find it, and I\nmust have kept seizing mine at the absurdest little rate, and all by\nthis deeply dissimulative process of taking in, through the whole\nsuccession of those summer days. The next application of it that stands\nout for me, or the next that I make room for here, since I note after\nall so much less than I remember, is the intensity of a fond\napprehension of Paris, a few days later, from the balcony of an hotel\nthat hung, through the soft summer night, over the Rue de la Paix. I\nhung with the balcony, and doubtless with my brothers and my sister,\nthough I recover what I felt as so much relation and response to the\nlarger, the largest appeal only, that of the whole perfect Parisianism I\nseemed to myself always to have possessed mentally--even if I had but\njust turned twelve!--and that now filled out its frame or case for me\nfrom every lighted window, up and down, as if each of these had been,\nfor strength of sense, a word in some immortal quotation, the very\nbreath of civilised lips. How I had anciently gathered such stores of\npreconception is more than I shall undertake an account of--though I\nbelieve I should be able to scrape one together; certain it is at any\nrate that half the beauty of the whole exposed second floor of a\n_modiste_ just opposite, for instance, with the fittings and figurings,\nas well as the intent immobilities, of busy young women descried through\nfrank, and, as it were, benignant apertures, and of such bright fine\nstrain that they but asked to work far into the night, came from the\neffect on the part of these things of so exactly crowning and comforting\nI couldn't have said what momentous young dream. I might have been\n_right_ to myself--as against some danger of being wrong, and if I had\nuttered my main comment on it all this must certainly have been \"I told\nyou so, I told you so!\" What I had told myself was of course that the\nimpression would be of the richest and at the same time of the most\ninsinuating, and this after all didn't sail very close; but I had had\nbefore me from far back a picture (which might have been hung in the\nvery sky,) and here was every touch in it repeated with a charm. Had I\never till then known what a charm _was_?--a large, a local, a social\ncharm, leaving out that of a few individuals. It was at all events, this\nmystery, one's property--that of one's mind; and so, once for all, I\nhelped myself to it from my balcony and tucked it away. It counted all\nimmensely for practice in taking in.\n\nI profited by that, no doubt, still a few days later, at an hour that\nhas never ceased to recur to me all my life as crucial, as supremely\ndeterminant. The travelling-carriage had stopped at a village on the way\nfrom Lyons to Geneva, between which places there was then no railway; a\nvillage now nameless to me and which was not yet Nantua, in the Jura,\nwhere we were to spend the night. I was stretched at my ease on a couch\nformed by a plank laid from seat to seat and covered by a small mattress\nand other draperies; an indulgence founded on my visitation of fever,\nwhich, though not now checking our progress, assured me, in our little\nband, these invidious luxuries. It may have been that as my body was\npampered so I was moved equally to pamper my spirit, for my\nappropriative instinct had neglected no item of our case from the\nfirst--by which I mean from the moment of our getting under way, that\nmorning, with much elaboration, in the court of the old H\u00c3\u00b4tel de\nl'Univers at Lyons, where we had arrived two days before and awaited my\ngood pleasure during forty-eight hours that overflowed for us perhaps\nsomewhat less than any pair of days yet, but as regards which it was\nafterwards my complacent theory that my contemplative rest at the\nancient inn, with all the voices and graces of the past, of the court,\nof the French scheme of manners in general and of ancient inns, as such,\nin particular, had prepared me not a little, when I should in due course\nhear of it, for what was meant by the _vie de province_--that expression\nwhich was to become later on so _toned_, as old fine colour and old fine\nopinion are toned. It was the romance of travel, and it was the\n_suggested_ romance, flushed with suppositions and echoes, with\nimplications and memories, memories of one's \"reading,\" save the mark!\nall the more that our proper bestowal required two carriages, in which\nwe were to \"post,\" ineffable thought, and which bristled with every kind\nof contradiction of common experience. The postilion, in a costume\nrather recalling, from the halls of Ferrero, that of my d\u00c3\u00a9bardeur,\nbobbed up and down, the Italian courier, Jean Nadali, black-whiskered\nand acquired in London, sat in the rumble along with Annette Godefroi of\nMetz, fresh-coloured, broad-faced and fair-braided, a \"bonne Lorraine\"\nif ever there was, acquired in New York: I enjoy the echo of their very\nnames, neither unprecedented nor irreproducible, yet which melt together\nfor me, to intensification, with all the rest; with the recovered\nmoment, above all, of our pause at the inn-door in the cool sunshine--we\nhad mounted and mounted--during which, in my absurdly cushioned state, I\ntook in, as I have hinted, by a long slow swig that testified to some\npower of elbow, a larger draught of the wine of perception than any I\nhad ever before owed to a single throb of that faculty. The village\nstreet, which was not as village streets hitherto known to me, opened\nout, beyond an interval, into a high place on which perched an object\nalso a fresh revelation and that I recognised with a deep joy--though a\njoy that was doubtless partly the sense of fantastic ease, of abated\nillness and of cold chicken--as at once a castle and a ruin. The only\ncastle within my ken had been, by my impression, the machicolated villa\nabove us the previous summer at New Brighton, and as I had seen no\nstructure rise beyond that majesty so I had seen none abased to the\ndignity of ruin. Loose boards were no expression of this latter phase,\nand I was already somehow aware of a deeper note in the crumbled castle\nthan any note of the solid one--little experience as I had had either of\nsolidity. At a point in the interval, at any rate, below the slope on\nwhich this memento stood, was a woman in a black bodice, a white shirt\nand a red petticoat, engaged in some sort of field labour, the effect of\nwhose intervention just then is almost beyond my notation. I knew her\nfor a peasant in sabots--the first peasant I had ever beheld, or beheld\nat least to such advantage. She had in the whole aspect an enormous\nvalue, emphasising with her petticoat's tonic strength the truth that\nsank in as I lay--the truth of one's embracing there, in all the\npresented character of the scene, an amount of character I had felt no\nscene present, not even the one I had raked from the H\u00c3\u00b4tel Westminster;\nthe sort of thing that, even as mere fulness and mere weight, would sit\nmost warmly in the mind. Supremely, in that ecstatic vision, was\n\"Europe,\" sublime synthesis, expressed and guaranteed to me--as if by a\nmystic gage, which spread all through the summer air, that I should now,\nonly now, never lose it, hold the whole consistency of it: up to that\ntime it might have been but mockingly whisked before me. Europe mightn't\nhave been flattered, it was true, at my finding her thus most signified\nand summarised in a sordid old woman scraping a mean living and an\nuninhabitable tower abandoned to the owls; that was but the momentary\nmeasure of a small sick boy, however, and the virtue of the impression\nwas proportioned to my capacity. It made a bridge over to more things\nthan I then knew.\n\n\n\n\nXXI\n\n\nHow shall I render certain other impressions coming back to me from that\nsummer, which were doubtless involved in my having still for a time, on\nthe alternate days when my complaint was active, to lie up on various\ncouches and, for my main comfort, consider the situation? I considered\nit best, I think, gathering in the fruits of a quickened sensibility to\nit, in certain umbrageous apartments in which my parents had settled\nthemselves near Geneva; an old house, in ample grounds and among great\nspreading trees that pleasantly brushed our windows in the summer heats\nand airs, known, if I am not mistaken, as the Campagne Gerebsoff--which\nits mistress, an invalid Russian lady, had partly placed at our\ndisposition while she reclined in her own quarter of the garden, on a\nchaise longue and under a mushroom hat with a green veil, and I, in the\ncourse of the mild excursions appointed as my limit, considered her from\nafar in the light of the legends supplied to me, as to her identity,\nhistory, general practices and proceedings, by my younger brother Wilky,\nwho, according to his nature, or I may say to his genius, had made\nwithout loss of time great advances of acquaintance with her and\nquickened thereby my sense of his superior talent for life. Wilky's age\nfollowed closely on mine, and from that time on we conversed and\nconsorted, though with lapses and disparities; I being on the whole,\nduring the succession of those years, in the grateful, the really\nfortunate position of having one exposure, rather the northward, as it\nwere, to the view of W. J., and the other, perhaps the more immediately\nsunned surface, to the genial glow of my junior. Of this I shall have\nmore to say, but to meet in memory meanwhile even this early flicker of\nhim is to know again something of the sense that I attached all along\nour boyhood to his successful sociability, his instinct for intercourse,\nhis genius (as I have used the word) for making friends. It was the only\ngenius he had, declaring itself from his tenderest years, never knowing\nthe shadow of defeat, and giving me, above all, from as far back and by\nthe very radiation of the fact, endlessly much to think of. For I had in\na manner, thanks to the radiation, much of the benefit; his geniality\nwas absolutely such that the friends he made were made almost less for\nhimself, so to speak, than for other friends--of whom indeed we, his own\nadjuncts, were easily first--so far at least as he discriminated. At\nnight all cats are grey, and in this brother's easy view all his\nacquaintance were his family. The trail of his sociability was over us\nall alike--though it here concerns me but to the effect, as I recover\nit, of its weight on my comparatively so indirect faculty for what is\ncalled taking life. I must have already at the Campagne Gerebsoff begun\nto see him take it with all his directness--begun in fact to be a trifle\ntormentedly aware that, though there might be many ways of so doing, we\nare condemned practically to a choice, not made free of them all;\nreduced to the use of but one, at the best, which it is to our interest\nto make the most of, since we may indeed sometimes make much. There was\na small sad charm, I should doubtless add, in this operation of the\ncontrast of the case before me with my own case; it was positively as if\nWilky's were supplying me on occasion with the most immediate matter for\nmy own. That was particularly marked after he had, with our elder\nbrother, been placed at school, the Pensionnat Roediger, at Ch\u00c3\u00a2telaine,\nthen much esteemed and where I was supposedly to join them on my\ncomplete recovery: I recall sociable, irrepressibly sociable _sorties_\nthence on the part of the pair as promptly breaking out, not less than I\nrecall sociable afternoon visits to the establishment on the part of the\nrest of us: it was my brothers' first boarding school, but as we had in\nthe New York conditions kept punctually rejoining our family, so in\nthese pleasant Genevese ones our family returned the attention. Of this\nalso more anon; my particular point is just the wealth of Wilky's\ncontribution to my rich current consciousness--the consciousness fairly\n_made_ rich by my taking in, as aforesaid, at reflective hours, hours\nwhen I was in a manner alone with it, our roomy and shadowy, our almost\nhaunted interior.\n\nAdmirable the scale and solidity, in general, of the ancient villas\nplanted about Geneva, and our house affected me as so massive and so\nspacious that even our own half of it seemed vast. I had never before\nlived so long in anything so old and, as I somehow felt, so deep; depth,\ndepth upon depth, was what came out for me at certain times of my\nwaiting above, in my immense room of thick embrasures and rather prompt\nobscurity, while the summer afternoon waned and my companions, often\nbelow at dinner, lingered and left me just perhaps a bit overwhelmed.\nThat was the sense of it--the _character_, in the whole place, pressed\nupon me with a force I hadn't met and that was beyond my analysis--which\nis but another way of saying how directly notified I felt that such\nmaterial conditions as I _had_ known could have had no depth at all. My\ndepth was a vague measure, no doubt, but it made space, in the twilight,\nfor an occasional small sound of voice or step from the garden or the\nrooms of which the great homely, the opaque green shutters opened there\nsoftly to echo in--mixed with reverberations finer and more momentous,\npersonal, experimental, if they might be called so; which I much\nencouraged (they borrowed such tone from our new surrounding medium) and\nhalf of which were reducible to Wilky's personalities and Wilky's\nexperience: these latter, irrepressibly communicated, being ever,\nenviably, though a trifle bewilderingly and even formidably, _of_\npersonalities. There was the difference and the opposition, as I really\nbelieve I was already aware--that one way of taking life was to go in\nfor everything and everyone, which kept you abundantly occupied, and the\nother way was to be as occupied, quite as occupied, just with the sense\nand the image of it all, and on only a fifth of the actual immersion: a\ncircumstance extremely strange. Life was taken almost equally both\nways--that, I mean, seemed the strangeness; mere brute quantity and\nnumber being so much less in one case than the other. These latter were\nwhat I should have _liked_ to go in for, had I but had the intrinsic\nfaculties; that more than ever came home to me on those occasions when,\nas I could move further and stay out longer, I accompanied my parents on\nafternoon visits to Ch\u00c3\u00a2telaine and the Campagne Roediger, a scene that\nhas remained with me as nobly placid and pastoral. The great trees stood\nabout, casting afternoon shadows; the old thick-walled green-shuttered\nvilla and its d\u00c3\u00a9pendances had the air of the happiest home; the big\nbearded bonhomie of M. Roediger among his little polyglot charges--no\npetits pays chauds these--appeared to justify, and more, the fond New\nYork theory of Swiss education, the kind _\u00c3\u00a0 la port\u00c3\u00a9e_ of young New\nYorkers, as a beautifully genialised, humanised, civilised, even\nromanticised thing, in which, amid lawny mountain slopes, \"the\nlanguages\" flowed into so many beaming recipients on a stream of milk\nand honey, and \"the relation,\" above all, the relation from master to\npupil and back again, was of an amenity that wouldn't have been of this\nworld save for the providential arrangement of a perfect pedagogic\nSwitzerland. \"Did you notice the relation--how charming it was?\" our\nparents were apt to say to each other after these visits, in reference\nto some observed show of confidence between instructor and instructed;\nwhile, as for myself, I was lost in the wonder of _all_ the\nrelations--my younger brother seemed to live, and to his own ingenuous\nrelish as well, in such a happy hum of them. The languages had reason to\nprosper--they were so copiously represented; the English jostled the\nAmerican, the Russian the German, and there even trickled through a\nlittle funny French.\n\nA great Geneva school of those days was the Institution Haccius, to\nwhich generations of our young countrymen had been dedicated and our own\nfaces first turned--under correction, however, by the perceived truth\nthat if the languages were in question the American reigned there almost\nunchallenged. The establishment chosen for our experiment must have\nappealed by some intimate and insinuating side, and as less patronised\nby the rich and the sophisticated--for even in those days some Americans\nwere rich and several sophisticated; little indeed as it was all to\nmatter in the event, so short a course had the experiment just then to\nrun. What it mainly brings back to me is the fine old candour and\nqueerness of the New York state of mind, begotten really not a little, I\nthink, under our own roof, by the mere charmed perusal of Rodolphe\nToeppfer's Voyages en Zigzag, the two goodly octavo volumes of which\ndelightful work, an adorable book, taken with its illustrations, had\ncome out early in the 'fifties and had engaged our fondest study. It is\nthe copious chronicle, by a schoolmaster o\u00c2\u00a3 endless humour and\nsympathy--of what degree and form of \"authority\" it never occurred to\none even to ask--of his holiday excursions with his pupils, mainly on\nfoot and with staff and knapsack, through the incomparable Switzerland\nof the time before the railways and the \"rush,\" before the monster\nhotels, the desecrated summits, the vulgarised valleys, the circular\ntours, the perforating tubes, the funiculars, the hordes, the horrors.\nTo turn back to Toeppfer's pages to-day is to get the sense of a lost\nparadise, and the effect for me even yet of having pored over them in my\nchildhood is to steep in sweetness and quaintness some of the\npictures--his own illustrations are of the pleasantest and drollest, and\nthe association makes that faded Swiss master of landscape Calame, of\nthe so-called calamit\u00c3\u00a9s, a quite sufficient Ruysdael. It must have been\nconceived for us that we would lead in these conditions--always in\npursuit of an education--a life not too dissimilar to that of the\nstoried exiles in the forest of Arden; though one would fain not press,\nafter all, upon ideals of culture so little organised, so little\nconscious, up to that moment, of our ferocities of comparison and\ncompetition, of imposed preparation. This particular loose ideal reached\nout from the desert--or what might under discouragement pass for such;\nit invoked the light, but a simplicity of view which was somehow one\nwith the beauty of other convictions accompanied its effort; and though\na glance at the social \"psychology\" of some of its cheerful estimates,\nits relative importances, assumed and acted upon, might here seem\nindicated, there are depths of the ancient serenity that nothing would\ninduce me to sound.\n\nI need linger the less, moreover, since we in fact, oddly enough,\nlingered so little; so very little, for reasons doubtless well known to\nourselves at the time but which I at present fail to recapture, that\nwhat next stands vividly out for me is our renewed passage through Paris\non the way to London for the winter; a turn of our situation invested at\nthe time with nothing whatever of the wonderful, yet which would again\nhalf prompt me to soundings were I not to recognise in it that mark of\nthe fitful, that accent of the improvised, that general quality of\nearnest and reasoned, yet at the same time almost passionate, impatience\nwhich was to devote us for some time to variety, almost to incoherency,\nof interest. We had fared across the sea under the glamour of the Swiss\nschool in the abstract, but the Swiss school in the concrete soon turned\nstale on our hands; a fact over which I remember myself as no further\ncritical than to feel, not without zest, that, since one was all eyes\nand the world decidedly, at such a pace, all images, it ministered to\nthe panoramic. It ministered, to begin with, through our very early\nstart for Lyons again in the October dawn--without Nadali or the\ncarriages this time, but on the basis of the malle-poste, vast, yellow\nand rumbling, which we availed wholly to fill and of which the high\nhaughtiness was such that it could stop, even for an instant, only at\nappointed and much dissevered places--to the effect, I recall, of its\nvainly attempted arrest by our cousin Charlotte King, beforementioned,\nwhom I see now suddenly emerge, fresh, confident and pretty, from some\nrural retreat by the road, a scene of simple villeggiatura, \"rien que\npour saluer ces dames,\" as she pleaded to the conductor; whom she\npractically, if not permittedly, overmastered, leaving with me still the\nwonder of her happy fusion of opposites. The coach had not, in the\nevent, paused, but so neither had she, and as it ignored flush and\nflurry quite as it defied delay, she was equally a match for it in these\nparticulars, blandly achieving her visit to us while it rumbled on,\nmaking a perfect success and a perfect grace of her idea. She dropped as\nelegantly out as she had gymnastically floated in, and \"ces dames\" must\nmuch have wished they could emulate her art. Save for this my view of\nthat migration has faded, though to shine out again to the sense of our\nearly morning arrival in Paris a couple of days later, and our hunt\nthere, vain at first, for an hotel that would put us numerously up; vain\ntill we had sat awhile, in the Rue du Helder, I think, before that of an\nAlbany uncle, luckily on the scene and finally invoked, who after some\ndelay descended to us with a very foreign air, I fancied, and no\npossibility, to his regret, of placing us under his own roof; as if\nindeed, I remember reflecting, we could, such as we were, have been\ndesired to share his foreign interests--such as _they_ were. He espoused\nour cause, however, with gay goodnature--while I wondered, in my\nadmiration for him and curiosity about him, how he really liked us, and\n(a bit doubtfully) whether I should have liked us had I been in his\nplace; and after some further adventure installed us at the H\u00c3\u00b4tel de la\nVille de Paris in the Rue de la Ville-l'Ev\u00c3\u00a8que, a resort now long since\nextinct, though it lingered on for some years, and which I think of as\nrather huddled and disappointingly private, to the abatement of\nspectacle, and standing obliquely beyond a wall, a high gateway and a\nmore or less cobbled court.\n\n\n\n\nXXII\n\n\nLittle else of that Parisian passage remains with me--it was probably of\nthe briefest; I recover only a visit with my father to the Palais de\nl'Industrie, where the first of the great French Exhibitions, on the\nmodel, much reduced, of the English Crystal Palace of 1851, was still\nopen, a fact explaining the crowded inns; and from that visit win back\nbut the department of the English pictures and our stopping long before\nThe Order of Release of a young English painter, J. E. Millais, who had\njust leaped into fame, and my impression of the rare treatment of whose\nbaby's bare legs, pendent from its mother's arms, is still as vivid to\nme as if from yesterday. The vivid yields again to the vague--I scarce\nknow why so utterly--till consciousness, waking up in London, renews\nitself, late one evening and very richly, at the Gloucester Hotel (or\nCoffee-House, as I think it was then still called,) which occupied that\ncorner of Piccadilly and Berkeley Street where more modern\nestablishments have since succeeded it, but where a fatigued and\nfamished American family found on that occasion a fine old British\nvirtue in cold roast beef and bread and cheese and ale; their expert\nacclamation of which echoes even now in my memory. It keeps company\nthere with other matters equally British and, as we say now, early\nVictorian; the thick gloom of the inn rooms, the faintness of the\nglimmering tapers, the blest inexhaustibility of the fine joint,\nsurpassed only by that of the grave waiter's reserve--plain, immutably\nplain fare all, but prompting in our elders an emphasis of relief and\nrelish, the \"There's nothing like it after all!\" tone, which re-excited\nexpectation, which in fact seemed this time to re-announce a basis for\nfaith and joy.\n\nThat basis presently shrank to the scale of a small house hard by the\nhotel, at the entrance of Berkeley Square--expeditiously lighted on, it\nwould thus appear, which again has been expensively superseded, but to\nthe ancient little facts of which I fondly revert, since I owe them what\nI feel to have been, in the far past, the prime faint revelation, the\nsmall broken expression, of the London I was afterwards to know. The\nplace wears on the spot, to this day, no very different face; the house\nthat has risen on the site of ours is still immediately neighboured at\nthe left by the bookseller, the circulating-librarian and news-agent,\nwho modestly flourished in our time under the same name; the great\nestablishment of Mr. Gunter, just further along, is as soberly and\nsolidly seated; the mews behind the whole row, from the foot of Hay Hill\nat the right, wanders away to Bruton Street with the irregular grace\nthat spoke to my young fancy; Hay Hill itself is somehow less sharply\nprecipitous, besides being no longer paved, as I seem to recall its\nhaving been, with big boulders, and I was on the point of saying that\nits antique charm in some degree abides. Nothing, however, could be\nfurther from the truth; its antique charm quite succumbed, years ago, to\nthat erection of lumpish \"mansions\" which followed the demolition of the\nold-world town-residence, as the house-agents say, standing, on the\nsouth side, between court and I suppose garden, where Dover Street gives\nway to Grafton; a house of many histories, of vague importances and cold\nreserves and deep suggestions, I used to think after scaling the steep\nquite on purpose to wonder about it. A whole chapter of life was\ncondensed, for our young sensibility, I make out, into the couple of\nmonths--they can scarce have been more--spent by us in these quarters,\nwhich must have proved too narrow and too towny; but it can have had no\npassage so lively as the occurrences at once sequent to my father's\nhaving too candidly made known in some public print, probably The Times,\nthat an American gentleman, at such an address, desired to arrange with\na competent young man for the tuition at home of his three sons. The\neffect of his rash failure to invite application by letter only was the\nassault of an army of visitors who filled us with consternation; they\nhung about the door, cumbered the hall, choked the staircase and sat\ngrimly individual in odd corners. How they were dealt with, given my\nfather's precipitate and general charity, I can but feebly imagine; our\nown concern, in the event, was with a sole selected presence, that of\nScotch Mr. Robert Thompson, who gave us his care from breakfast to\nluncheon each morning that winter, who afterwards carried on a school at\nEdinburgh, and whom, in years long subsequent, I happened to help R. L.\nStevenson to recognise gaily as _his_ early pedagogue. He was so deeply\nsolicitous, yet withal so mild and kind and shy, with no harsher\ninjunction to us ever than \"Come now, be getting on!\" that one could but\nthink well of a world in which so gentle a spirit might flourish; while\nit is doubtless to the credit of his temper that remembrance is a blank\nin respect to his closer ministrations. I recall vividly his fresh\ncomplexion, his very round clear eyes, his tendency to trip over his own\nlegs or feet while thoughtfully circling about us, and his constant\ndress-coat, worn with trousers of a lighter hue, which was perhaps the\nprescribed uniform of a daily tutor then; but I ask myself in vain what\nI can have \"studied\" with him, there remaining with me afterwards, to\ntestify--this putting any scrap of stored learning aside--no single\ntextbook save the Lambs' Tales from Shakespeare, which was given me as\n(of all things in the world) a reward. A reward for what I am again at a\nloss to say--not certainly for having \"got on\" to anything like the tune\nplaintively, for the most part, piped to me. It is a very odd and yet to\nmyself very rich and full reminiscence, though I remember how, looking\nback at it from after days, W. J. denounced it to me, and with it the\nfollowing year and more spent in Paris, as a poor and arid and\nlamentable time, in which, missing such larger chances and connections\nas we might have reached out to, we had done nothing, he and I, but walk\nabout together, in a state of the direst propriety, little \"high\" black\nhats and inveterate gloves, the childish costume of the place and\nperiod, to stare at grey street-scenery (that of early Victorian London\nhad tones of a neutrality!) dawdle at shop-windows and buy water-colours\nand brushes with which to bedaub eternal drawing-blocks. We might, I\ndare say, have felt higher impulses and carried out larger plans--though\nindeed present to me for this, on my brother's so expressing himself, is\nmy then quick recognition of the deeper stirrings and braver needs he at\nleast must have known, and my perfect if rueful sense of having myself\nhad no such quarrel with our conditions: embalmed for me did they even\nto that shorter retrospect appear in a sort of fatalism of patience,\nspiritless in a manner, no doubt, yet with an inwardly active,\nproductive and ingenious side.\n\nIt was just the fact of our having so walked and dawdled and dodged that\nmade the charm of memory; in addition to which what could one have asked\nmore than to be steeped in a medium so dense that whole elements of it,\nforms of amusement, interest and wonder, soaked through to some\nappreciative faculty and made one fail at the most of nothing but one's\nlessons? My brother was right in so far as that my question--the one I\nhave just reproduced--could have been asked only by a person\nincorrigible in throwing himself back upon substitutes for lost causes,\nsubstitutes that might _temporarily_ have appeared queer and small; a\nperson so haunted, even from an early age, with visions of life, that\naridities, for him, were half a terror and half an impossibility, and\nthat the said substitutes, the economies and ingenuities that protested,\nin their dumb vague way, against weakness of situation or of direct and\napplied faculty, were in themselves really a revel of spirit and\nthought. It _had_ indeed again an effect of almost pathetic incoherence\nthat our brave quest of \"the languages,\" suffering so prompt and for the\ntime at least so accepted and now so inscrutably irrecoverable a check,\nshould have contented itself with settling us by that Christmas in a\nhouse, more propitious to our development, in St. John's Wood, where we\nenjoyed a considerable garden and wistful view, though by that windowed\nprivilege alone, of a large green expanse in which ladies and gentlemen\npractised archery. Just _that_--and not the art even, but the mere\nspectacle--might have been one of the substitutes in question; if not\nfor the languages at least for one or another of the romantic\nconnections we seemed a little to have missed: it was such a whiff of\nthe old world of Robin Hood as we could never have looked up from the\nmere thumbed \"story,\" in Fourteenth Street at any rate, to any soft\nconfidence of. More than I can begin to say, that is by a greater number\nof queer small channels, did the world about us, thus continuous with\nthe old world of Robin Hood, steal into my sense--a constant state of\nsubjection to which fact is no bad instance of those refinements of\nsurrender that I just named as my fond practice. I seem to see to-day\nthat the London of the 'fifties was even to the weak perception of\nchildhood a much less generalised, a much more eccentrically and\nvariously characterised place, than the present great accommodated and\naccommodating city; it had fewer resources but it had many more\nfeatures, scarce one of which failed to help the whole to bristle with\nwhat a little gaping American could take for an intensity of difference\nfrom _his_ supposed order. It was extraordinarily the picture and the\nscene of Dickens, now so changed and superseded; it offered to my\npresumptuous vision still more the reflection of Thackeray--and where is\nthe _detail_ of the reflection of Thackeray now?--so that as I trod the\nvast length of Baker Street, the Thackerayan vista of other days, I\nthrobbed with the pride of a vastly enlarged acquaintance.\n\nI dare say our perambulations of Baker Street in our little \"top\" hats\nand other neatnesses must have been what W. J. meant by our poverty of\nlife--whereas it was probably one of the very things most expressive to\nmyself of the charm and the colour of history and (from the point of\nview of the picturesque) of society. We were often in Baker Street by\nreason of those stretched-out walks, at the remembered frequency and\nlong-drawn push of which I am to-day amazed; recalling at the same time,\nhowever, that save for Robert Thompson's pitching ball with us in the\ngarden they took for us the place of all other agilities. I can't but\nfeel them to have been marked in their way by a rare curiosity and\nenergy. Good Mr. Thompson had followed us in our move, occupying\nquarters, not far off, above a baker's shop on a Terrace--a group of\nobjects still untouched by time--where we occasionally by way of change\nattended for our lessons and where not the least of our inspirations was\nthe confidence, again and again justified, that our mid-morning \"break\"\nwould determine the appearance of a self-conscious stale cake, straight\nfrom below, received by us all each time as if it had been a sudden\nhappy thought, and ushered in by a little girl who might have been a\nDickens foundling or \"orfling.\" Our being reduced to mumble cake in a\nsuburban lodging by way of reaction from the strain of study would have\nbeen perhaps a pathetic picture, but we had field-days too, when we\naccompanied our excellent friend to the Tower, the Thames Tunnel, St.\nPaul's and the Abbey, to say nothing of the Zoological Gardens, almost\nclose at hand and with which we took in that age of lingering forms no\nliberty of abbreviation; to say nothing either of Madame Tussaud's, then\nin our interminable but so amiable Baker Street, the only shade on the\namiability of which was just that gruesome association with the portal\nof the Bazaar--since Madame Tussaud had, of all her treasures, most\nvividly revealed to me the Mrs. Manning and the Burke and Hare of the\nChamber of Horrors which lurked just within it; whom, for days after\nmaking their acquaintance (and prolonging it no further than our\nconscientious friend thought advisable) I half expected, when alone, to\nmeet quite dreadfully on the staircase or on opening a door. All this\nexperience was valuable, but it was not the languages--save in so far\nindeed as it was the English, which we hadn't in advance so much aimed\nat, yet which more or less, and very interestingly, came; it at any rate\nperhaps broke our fall a little that French, of a sort, continued to be\nwith us in the remarkably erect person of Mademoiselle Cusin, the Swiss\ngoverness who had accompanied us from Geneva, whose quite sharply\nextrusive but on the whole exhilarating presence I associate with this\nwinter, and who led in that longish procession of more or less similar\ndomesticated presences which was to keep the torch, that is the accent,\namong us, fairly alight. The variety and frequency of the arrivals and\ndepartures of these ladies--whose ghostly names, again, so far as I\nrecall them, I like piously to preserve, Augustine Danse, Am\u00c3\u00a9lie Fortin,\nMarie Guyard, Marie Bonningue, F\u00c3\u00a9licie Bonningue, Clarisse\nBader--mystifies me in much the same degree as our own academic\nvicissitudes in New York; I can no more imagine why, sociable and\ncharitable, we so often changed governesses than I had contemporaneously\ngrasped the principle of our succession of schools: the whole group of\nphenomena reflected, I gather, as a rule, much more the extreme\npromptitude of the parental optimism than any disproportionate habit of\nimpatience. The optimism begot precipitation, and the precipitation had\ntoo often to confess itself. What is instructive, what is historic, is\nthe probability that young persons offering themselves at that time as\nguides and communicators--the requirements of our small sister were for\nlong modest enough--quite conceivably lacked preparedness, and were so\nthrown back on the extempore, which in turn lacked abundance. One of\nthese figures, that of Mademoiselle Danse, the most Parisian, and\nprodigiously so, was afterwards to stand out for us quite luridly--a\ncloud of revelations succeeding her withdrawal; a cloud which, thick as\nit was, never obscured our impression of her genius and her charm. The\ndaughter of a political proscript who had but just escaped, by the\nlegend, being seized in his bed on the terrible night of the\nDeux-D\u00c3\u00a9cembre, and who wrote her micawberish letters from Gallipolis,\nOhio, she subsequently figured to my imagination (in the light, that is,\nof the divined revelations, too dreadful for our young ears,) as the\nmost brilliant and most genial of irregular characters, exhibiting the\nParisian \"mentality\" at its highest, or perhaps rather its deepest, and\nmore remarkable for nothing than for the consummate little art and grace\nwith which she had for a whole year draped herself in the mantle of our\ninnocent air. It was exciting, it was really valuable, to have to that\nextent rubbed shoulders with an \"adventuress\"; it showed one that for\nthe adventuress there might on occasion be much to be said.\n\nThose, however, were later things--extensions of view hampered for the\npresent, as I have noted, by our mere London street-scenery, which had\nmuch to build out for us. I see again that we but endlessly walked and\nendlessly daubed, and that our walks, with an obsession of their own,\nconstantly abetted our daubing. We knew no other boys at all, and we\neven saw no others, I seem to remember, save the essentially rude ones,\nrude with a kind of medi\u00c3\u00a6val rudeness for which our clear New York\nexperience had given us no precedent, and of which the great and\nconstant sign was the artless, invidious wonder produced in them, on our\npublic appearances, by the alien stamp in us that, for our comfort, we\nvainly sought to dissimulate. We conformed in each particular, so far as\nwe could, to the prevailing fashion and standard, of a narrow range in\nthose days, but in our very plumage--putting our _ramage_ aside--our\nwood-note wild must have seemed to sound, so sharply we challenged, when\nabroad, the attention of our native contemporaries, and even sometimes\nof their elders, pulled up at sight of us in the from-head-to-foot\nstare, a curiosity void of sympathy and that attached itself for some\nreason especially to our feet, which were not abnormally large. The\nLondon people had for themselves, at the same time, an exuberance of\ntype; we found it in particular a world of costume, often of very odd\ncostume--the most intimate notes of which were the postmen in their\nfrock-coats of military red and their black beaver hats; the milkwomen,\nin hats that often emulated these, in little shawls and strange short,\nfull frocks, revealing enormous boots, with their pails swung from their\nshoulders on wooden yokes; the inveterate footmen hooked behind the\ncoaches of the rich, frequently in pairs and carrying staves, together\nwith the mounted and belted grooms without the attendance of whom\nriders, of whichever sex--and riders then were much more\nnumerous--almost never went forth. The range of character, on the other\nhand, reached rather dreadfully down; there were embodied and\nexemplified \"horrors\" in the streets beside which any present exhibition\nis pale, and I well remember the almost terrified sense of their\nsalience produced in me a couple of years later, on the occasion of a\nflying return from the Continent with my father, by a long, an\ninterminable drive westward from the London Bridge railway-station. It\nwas a soft June evening, with a lingering light and swarming crowds, as\nthey then seemed to me, of figures reminding me of George Cruikshank's\nArtful Dodger and his Bill Sikes and his Nancy, only with the bigger\nbrutality of life, which pressed upon the cab, the early-Victorian\nfourwheeler, as we jogged over the Bridge, and cropped up in more and\nmore gas-lit patches for all our course, culminating, somewhere far to\nthe west, in the vivid picture, framed by the cab-window, of a woman\nreeling backward as a man felled her to the ground with a blow in the\nface. The London view at large had in fact more than a Cruikshank, there\nstill survived in it quite a Hogarth, side--which I had of course then\nno name for, but which I was so sharply to recognise on coming back\nyears later that it fixed for me the veracity of the great pictorial\nchronicler. Hogarth's mark is even yet not wholly overlaid; though time\nhas _per contra_ dealt with that stale servility of address which most\nexpressed to our young minds the rich burden of a Past, the consequence\nof too much history. I liked for my own part a lot of history, but felt\nin face of certain queer old obsequiosities and appeals, whinings and\nsidlings and hand-rubbings and curtsey-droppings, the general play of\napology and humility, behind which the great dim social complexity\nseemed to mass itself, that one didn't quite want so inordinate a\nquantity. Of that particular light and shade, however, the big broom of\nchange has swept the scene bare; more history still has been after all\nwhat it wanted. Quite another order, in the whole connection, strikes\nme as reigning to-day--though not without the reminder from it that the\nrelations in which manner, as a generalised thing, in which \"tone,\" is\n_positively_ pleasant, is really assured and sound, clear and\ninteresting, are numerous and definite only when it has had in its past\nsome strange phases and much misadventure.\n\n\n\n\nXXIII\n\n\nWe were still being but vaguely \"formed,\" yet it was a vagueness\npreferred apparently by our parents to the only definiteness in any\ndegree open to us, that of the English school away from home (the London\nprivate school near home they would absolutely none of;) which they saw\nas a fearful and wonderful, though seemingly effective, preparation of\nthe young for English life and an English career, but related to that\nsituation only, so little related in fact to any other as to make it, in\na differing case, an educational cul-de-sac, the worst of economies.\nThey had doubtless heard claimed for it just that no other method for\nboys _was_ so splendidly general, but they had, I judge, their own sense\nof the matter--which would have been that it all depended on what was\nmeant by this. The truth was, above all, that to them the formative\nforces most closely bearing on us were not in the least vague, but very\ndefinite by _their_ measure and intention; there were \"advantages,\"\ngenerally much belauded, that appealed to them scantly, and other\nmatters, conceptions of character and opportunity, ideals, values,\nimportances, enjoying no great common credit but for which it was their\nbelief that they, under whatever difficulties, more or less provided. In\nrespect of which I further remind myself of the blest fewness, as yet,\nof our years; and I come back to my own sense, benighted though it may\nhave been, of a highly-coloured and remarkably active life. I recognise\nour immediate, our practical ferment even in our decent perambulations,\nour discussions, W. J.'s and mine, of whether we had in a given case\nbest apply for a renewal of our \"artists' materials\" to Messrs. Rowney\nor to Messrs. Windsor and Newton, and in our pious resort, on these\ndeterminations, to Rathbone Place, more beset by our steps, probably,\nthan any other single corner of the town, and the short but charged\nvista of which lives for me again in the tempered light of those old\nwinter afternoons. Of scarce less moment than these were our frequent\nvisits, in the same general connection, to the old Pantheon of Oxford\nStreet, now fallen from its high estate, but during that age a place of\nfine rococo traditions, a bazaar, an exhibition, an opportunity, at the\nend of long walks, for the consumption of buns and ginger-beer, and\nabove all a monument to the genius of that wonderful painter B. R.\nHaydon. We must at one time quite have haunted the Pantheon, where we\ndoubtless could better than elsewhere sink to contemplative, to\nruminative rest: Haydon's huge canvases covered the walls--I wonder\nwhat has become now of The Banishment of Aristides, attended to the city\ngate by his wife and babe, every attitude and figure in which,\nespecially that of the foreshortened boy picking up stones to shy at the\nall-too-just, stares out at me still. We found in these works remarkable\ninterest and beauty, the reason of which was partly, no doubt, that we\nhung, to fascination, at home, over the three volumes of the hapless\nartist's Autobiography, then a new book, which our father, indulgent to\nour preoccupation, had provided us with; but I blush to risk the further\nsurmise that the grand manner, the heroic and the classic, in Haydon,\ncame home to us more warmly and humanly than in the masters commended as\n\"old,\" who, at the National Gallery, seemed to meet us so little\nhalf-way, to hold out the hand of fellowship or suggest something that\n_we_ could do, or could at least want to. The beauty of Haydon was just\nthat he was new, shiningly new, and if he hinted that we might perhaps\nin some happy future emulate his big bravery there was nothing so\nimpossible about it. If we adored daubing we preferred it _fresh_, and\nthe genius of the Pantheon was fresh, whereas, strange to say, Rubens\nand Titian were not. Even the charm of the Pantheon yielded, however, to\nthat of the English collection, the Vernon bequest to the nation, then\narrayed at Marlborough House and to which the great plumed and draped\nand dusty funeral car of the Duke of Wellington formed an attractive\nadjunct. The ground-floor chambers there, none of them at that time\nroyally inhabited, come back to me as altogether bleak and bare and as\nowing their only dignity to Maclise, Mulready and Landseer, to David\nWilkie and Charles Leslie. _They_ were, by some deep-seated English\nmystery, the real unattainable, just as they were none the less the\ndirectly inspiring and the endlessly delightful. I could never have\nenough of Maclise's Play-scene in Hamlet, which I supposed the finest\ncomposition in the world (though Ophelia did look a little as if cut in\nsilhouette out of white paper and pasted on;) while as I gazed, and\ngazed again, at Leslie's Sancho Panza and his Duchess I pushed through\nthe great hall of romance to the central or private apartments.\nTrafalgar Square had its straight message for us only in the May-time\nexhibition, the Royal Academy of those days having, without a home of\nits own, to borrow space from the National Gallery--space partly\noccupied, in the summer of 1856, by the first fresh fruits of the\nPre-Raphaelite efflorescence, among which I distinguish Millais's Vale\nof Rest, his Autumn Leaves and, if I am not mistaken, his prodigious\nBlind Girl. The very word Pre-Raphaelite wore for us that intensity of\nmeaning, not less than of mystery, that thrills us in its perfection but\nfor one season, the prime hour of first initiations, and I may perhaps\nsomewhat mix the order of our great little passages of perception.\nMomentous to us again was to be the Academy show of 1858, where there\nwere, from the same wide source, still other challenges to wonder,\nHolman Hunt's Scapegoat most of all, which I remember finding so charged\nwith the awful that I was glad I saw it in company--_it_ in company and\nI the same: I believed, or tried to believe, I should have feared to\nface it all alone in a room. By that time moreover--I mean by 1858--we\nhad been more fully indoctrinated, or such was the case at least with\nW. J., for whom, in Paris, during the winter of 1857, instruction at the\natelier of M. L\u00c3\u00a9on Coigniet, of a limited order and adapted to his\nyears, had been candidly provided--that M. L\u00c3\u00a9on Coigniet whose Marius\nmeditating among the Ruins of Carthage impressed us the more, at the\nLuxembourg (even more haunted by us in due course than the Pantheon had\nbeen,) in consequence of this family connection.\n\nLet me not, however, nip the present thread of our \u00c3\u00a6sthetic evolution\nwithout a glance at that comparatively spare but deeply appreciated\nexperience of the London theatric privilege which, so far as occasion\nfavoured us, also pressed the easy spring. The New York familiarities\nhad to drop; going to the play presented itself in London as a serious,\nponderous business: a procession of two throbbing and heaving cabs over\nvast foggy tracts of the town, after much arrangement in advance and\nwith a renewal of far peregrination, through twisting passages and\ncatacombs, even after crossing the magic threshold. We sat in strange\nplaces, with still stranger ones behind or beside; we felt walls and\npartitions, in our rear, getting so hot that we wondered if the house\nwas to burst into flame; I recall in especial our being arrayed, to the\nnumber of nine persons, all of our contingent, in a sort of rustic\nbalcony or verandah which, simulating the outer gallery of a Swiss\ncottage framed in creepers, formed a feature of Mr. Albert Smith's\nonce-famous representation of the Tour of Mont Blanc. Big, bearded,\nrattling, chattering, mimicking Albert Smith again charms my senses,\nthough subject to the reflection that his type and presence,\nsuperficially so important, so ample, were somehow at odds with such\ningratiations, with the reckless levity of his performance--a\nperformance one of the great effects of which was, as I remember it, the\nvery brief stop and re-departure of the train at \u00c3\u0089pernay, with the\nringing of bells, the bawling of guards, the cries of travellers, the\nslamming of doors and the tremendous pop as of a colossal\nchampagne-cork, made all simultaneous and vivid by Mr. Smith's mere\npersonal resources and graces. But it is the publicity of our situation\nas a happy family that I best remember, and how, to our embarrassment,\nwe seemed put forward in our illustrative ch\u00c3\u00a2let as part of the\nboisterous show and of what had been paid for by the house. Two other\ngreat evenings stand out for me as not less collectively enjoyed, one of\nthese at the Princess's, then under the management of Charles Kean, the\nunprecedented (as he was held) Shakespearean revivalist, the other at\nthe Olympic, where Alfred Wigan, the extraordinary and too short-lived\nRobson and the shrewd and handsome Mrs. Stirling were the high\nattraction. Our enjoyment of Charles Kean's presentation of Henry the\nEighth figures to me as a momentous date in our lives: we did nothing\nfor weeks afterwards but try to reproduce in water-colours Queen\nKatharine's dream-vision of the beckoning, consoling angels, a radiant\ngroup let down from the skies by machinery then thought marvellous--when\nindeed we were not parading across our schoolroom stage as the\nportentous Cardinal and impressively alternating his last speech to\nCromwell with Buckingham's, that is with Mr. Ryder's, address on the way\nto the scaffold. The spectacle had seemed to us prodigious--as it was\ndoubtless at its time the last word of costly scenic science; though as\nI look back from the high ground of an age that has mastered tone and\nfusion I seem to see it as comparatively garish and violent, after the\nmanner of the complacently approved stained-glass church-windows of the\nsame period. I was to have my impression of Charles Kean renewed later\non--ten years later, in America--without a rag of scenic reinforcement;\nwhen I was struck with the fact that no actor so little graced by nature\nprobably ever went so far toward repairing it by a kind of cold rage of\nendeavour. Were he and his wife really not _coercively_ interesting on\nthat Boston night of Macbeth in particular, hadn't their art a\ndistinction that triumphed over battered age and sorry harshness, or was\nI but too easily beguiled by the old association? I have enjoyed and\nforgotten numberless rich hours of spectatorship, but somehow still find\nhooked to the wall of memory the picture of this hushed couple in the\ncastle court, with the knocking at the gate, with Macbeth's stare of\npitiful horror at his unused daggers and with the grand manner, up to\nthe height of the argument, of Mrs. Kean's coldly portentous snatch of\nthem. What I especially owe that lady is my sense of what she had in\ncommon, as a queer hooped and hook-nosed figure, of large circumference\nand archaic attire, strange tasteless toggery, with those performers of\nthe past who are preserved for us on the small canvases of Hogarth and\nZoffany; she helped one back at that time of her life to a vision of\nthe Mrs. Cibbers and the Mrs. Pritchards--so affecting may often be such\nrecovered links.\n\nI see the evening at the Olympic as really itself partaking of that\nantiquity, even though Still Waters Run Deep, then in its flourishing\nfreshness and as to which I remember my fine old friend Fanny Kemble's\nmentioning to me in the distant after-time that she had directed Tom\nTaylor to Charles de Bernard's novel of Un Gendre for the subject of it,\npassed at the moment for a highly modern \"social study.\" It is perhaps\nin particular through the memory of our dismal approach to the theatre,\nthe squalid slum of Wych Street, then incredibly brutal and barbarous as\nan avenue to joy, an avenue even sometimes for the muffled coach of\nRoyalty, that the episode affects me as antedating some of the\nconditions of the mid-Victorian age; the general credit of which, I\nshould add, was highly re-established for us by the consummately quiet\nand natural art, as we expertly pronounced it, of Alfred Wigan's John\nMildmay and the breadth and sincerity of the representative of the rash\nmother-in-law whom he so imperturbably puts in her place. This was an\nexhibition supposed in its day to leave its spectators little to envy in\nthe highest finish reached by the French theatre. At a remarkable\nheight, in a different direction, moved the strange and vivid little\ngenius of Robson, a master of fantastic intensity, unforgettable for\nus, we felt that night, in Planch\u00c3\u00a9's extravaganza of The Discreet\nPrincess, a Christmas production preluding to the immemorial\nharlequinade. I still see Robson slide across the stage, in one sidelong\nwriggle, as the small black sinister Prince Richcraft of the fairy-tale,\neverything he did at once very dreadful and very droll, thoroughly true\nand yet none the less _macabre_, the great point of it all its parody of\nCharles Kean in The Corsican Brothers; a vision filled out a couple of\nyears further on by his Daddy Hardacre in a two-acts version of a\nParisian piece thriftily and coarsely extracted from Balzac's Eug\u00c3\u00a9nie\nGrandet. This occasion must have given the real and the finer measure of\nhis highly original talent; so present to me, despite the interval, is\nthe distinctiveness of his little concentrated rustic miser whose\ndaughter helps herself from his money-box so that her cousin and lover\nshall save a desperate father, her paternal uncle, from bankruptcy; and\nthe prodigious effect of Robson's appalled descent, from an upper floor,\nhis literal headlong tumble and rattle of dismay down a steep staircase\noccupying the centre of the stage, on his discovery of the rifling of\nhis chest. Long was I to have in my ears the repeated shriek of his\nalarm, followed by a panting babble of wonder and rage as his impetus\nhurled him, a prostrate scrap of despair (he was a tiny figure, yet \"so\nheld the stage\" that in his company you could see nobody else) half way\nacross the room. I associate a little uncertainly with the same night\nthe sight of Charles Matthews in Sheridan's Critic and in a comedy\nbotched from the French, like everything else in those days that was not\neither Sheridan or Shakespeare, called Married for Money; an example\nabove all, this association, of the heaped measure of the old\nbills--vast and various enumerations as they were, of the size of but\nslightly reduced placards and with a strange and delightful greasy feel\nand redolence of printer's ink, intensely theatrical ink somehow, in\ntheir big black lettering. Charles Matthews must have been then in his\nmid-career, and him too, wasted and aged, infinitely \"marked,\" I was to\nsee again, ever so long after, in America; an impression reminding me,\nas I recover it, of how one took his talent so thoroughly for granted\nthat he seemed somehow to get but half the credit of it: this at least\nin all save parts of mere farce and \"patter,\" which were on a footing,\nand no very interesting one, of their own. The other effect, that of a\nnaturalness so easy and immediate, so friendly and intimate, that one's\nrelation with the artist lost itself in one's relation with the\ncharacter, the artist thereby somehow positively suffering while the\ncharacter gained, or at least while the spectator did--this comes back\nto me quite as a part even of my earlier experience and as attesting on\nbehalf of the actor a remarkable genius; since there are no more\ncharming artistic cases than those of the frank result, when it is frank\n_enough_, and the dissimulated process, when the dissimulation has been\ndeep. To drop, or appear to drop, machinery and yet keep, or at least\ngain, intensity, the interesting intensity separated by a gulf from a\nmere unbought coincidence of aspect or organ, is really to do something.\nIn spite of which, at the same time, what I perhaps most retain, by the\nlight of the present, of the sense of that big and rather dusky night of\nDrury Lane is not so much the felt degree of anyone's talent as the fact\nthat personality and artistry, _with_ their intensity, could work their\nspell in such a material desert, in conditions intrinsically so\ncharmless, so bleak and bare. The conditions gave nothing of what we\nregard to-day as most indispensable--since our present fine conception\nis but to reduce and fill in the material desert, to people and carpet\nand curtain it. We may be right, so far as that goes, but our\npredecessors were, with their eye on the essence, not wrong; thanks to\nwhich they wear the crown of our now thinking of them--if we do think of\nthem--as in their way giants and heroes. What their successors were to\nbecome is another question; very much better dressed, beyond all doubt.\n\n\n\n\nXXIV\n\n\nGood Robert Thompson was followed by _fin_ M. Lerambert--who was surely\ngood too, in his different way; good at least for feigning an interest\nhe could scarce have rejoicingly felt and that he yet somehow managed to\ngive a due impression of: that artifice being, as we must dimly have\ndivined at the time (in fact I make bold to say that I personally did\ndivine it,) exactly a sign of his _finesse_. Of no such uncanny engine\nhad Mr. Thompson, luckily, known a need--luckily since to what arsenal\ncould he possibly have resorted for it? None capable of supplying it\ncould ever have met his sight, and we ourselves should at a pinch have\nhad to help him toward it. He was easily interested, or at least took an\neasy view, on such ground as we offered him, of what it was to be so;\nwhereas his successor attached to the condition a different value--one\nrecognising no secondary substitute. Perhaps this was why our connection\nwith M. Lerambert can have lasted but four or five months--time even for\nhis sharp subterfuge to have ceased entirely to serve him; though indeed\neven as I say this I vaguely recall that our separation was attended\nwith friction, that it took him unaware and that he had been prepared\n(or so represented himself) for further sacrifices. It could have been\nno great one, assuredly, to deal with so intensely living a young mind\nas my elder brother's, it could have been but a happy impression\nconstantly renewed; but we two juniors, Wilky and I, were a\ndrag--Wilky's powers most displayed at that time in his preference for\ningenuous talk over any other pursuit whatever, and my own aptitude\nshowing for nil, according to our poor gentleman's report of me when a\ncouple of months had sped, save as to rendering La Fontaine's fables\ninto English with a certain corresponding felicity of idiom. I remember\nperfectly the parental communication to me of this fell judgment, I\nremember as well the interest with which its so quite definite character\ninspired me--that character had such beauty and distinctness; yet, and\never so strangely, I recover no sense of having been crushed, and this\neven though destitute, utterly, of any ground of appeal. The fact leaves\nme at a loss, since I also remember my not having myself thought\nparticularly well, in the connection allowed, of my \"rendering\" faculty.\n\"Oh,\" I seem inwardly to have said, \"if it were to be, if it only could\nbe, _really_ a question of rendering--!\" and so, without confusion,\nthough in vague, very vague, mystification to have left it: as if so\nmany things, intrinsic and extrinsic, would have to change and operate,\nso many would have to happen, so much water have to flow under the\nbridge, before I could give primary application to such a thought, much\nmore finish such a sentence.\n\nAll of which is but a way of saying that we had since the beginning of\nthe summer settled ourselves in Paris, and that M. Lerambert--by what\nagency invoked, by what revelation vouchsafed, I quite forget--was at\nthis time attending us in a so-called pavilion, of middling size, that,\nbetween the Rond-Point and the Rue du Colis\u00c3\u00a9e, hung, at no great height,\nover the Avenue des Champs-Elys\u00c3\u00a9es; hung, that is, from the vantage of\nits own considerable terrace, surmounted as the parapet of the latter\nwas with iron railings rising sufficiently to protect the place for\nfamiliar use and covert contemplation (we ever so fondly used it,) and\nyet not to the point of fencing out life. A blest little old-world\nrefuge it must have seemed to us, with its protuberantly-paved and\npeculiarly resonant small court and idle _communs_ beside it, accessible\nby a high grille where the jangle of the bell and the clatter of\nresponse across the stones might have figured a comprehensive echo of\nall old Paris. Old Paris then even there considerably lingered; I\nrecapture much of its presence, for that matter, within our odd relic\nof a house, the property of an American southerner from whom our\nparents had briefly hired it and who appeared to divide his time, poor\nunadmonished gentleman of the eve of the Revolution, between Louisiana\nand France. What association could have breathed more from the queer\ngraces and the queer incommodities alike, from the diffused glassy\npolish of floor and perilous staircase, from the redundancy of mirror\nand clock and ormolu vase, from the irrepressibility of the white and\ngold panel, from that merciless elegance of tense red damask, above all,\nwhich made the gilt-framed backs of sofa and chair as sumptuous, no\ndoubt, but as sumptuously stiff, as the brocaded walls? It was amid\nthese refinements that we presently resumed our studies--even explicitly\nfar from arduous at first, as the Champs-Elys\u00c3\u00a9es were perforce that year\nour summer habitation and some deference was due to the place and the\nseason, lessons of any sort being at best an infraction of the latter.\nM. Lerambert, who was spare and tightly black-coated, spectacled, pale\nand prominently intellectual, who lived in the Rue Jacob with his mother\nand sister, exactly as he should have done to accentuate prophetically\nhis resemblance, save for the spectacles, to some hero of Victor\nCherbuliez, and who, in fine, was conscious, not unimpressively, of his\nauthorship of a volume of meditative verse sympathetically mentioned by\nthe Sainte-Beuve of the Causeries in a review of the young poets of the\nhour (\"M. Lerambert too has loved, M. Lerambert too has suffered, M.\nLerambert too has sung!\" or words to that effect:) this subtle\npersonality, really a high form of sensibility I surmise, and as\nqualified for other and intenser relations as any Cherbuliez figure of\nthem all, was naturally not to be counted on to lead us gapingly forth\nas good Mr. Thompson had done; so that my reminiscence of warm\nsomniferous mornings by the windows that opened to the clattery, plashy\ncourt is quite, so far as my record goes, relievingly unbroken.\n\nThe afternoons, however, glimmer back to me shamelessly different, for\nour circle had promptly been joined by the all-knowing and all-imposing\nMademoiselle Danse aforesaid, her of the so flexible _taille_ and the so\nsalient smiling eyes, than which even those of Miss Rebecca Sharp, that\nother epic governess, were not more pleasingly green; who provided with\nhigh efficiency for our immediate looser needs--mine and Wilky's and\nthose of our small brother Bob (l'ing\u00c3\u00a9nieux petit Robertson as she was\nto dub him,) and of our still smaller sister at least--our first fine\n_fl\u00c3\u00a2neries_ of curiosity. Her brave Vaudoise predecessor had been\nbequeathed by us in London to a higher sphere than service with mere\nearnest nomads could represent; but had left us clinging and weeping\nand was for a long time afterwards to write to us, faithfully, in the\nmost beautiful copper-plate hand, out of the midst of her \"rise\"; with\ndetails that brought home to us as we had never known it brought the\nmaterial and institutional difference between the nomadic and the\nsolidly, the spreadingly seated. A couple of years later, on an occasion\nof our being again for a while in London, she hastened to call on us,\nand, on departing, amiably invited me to walk back with her, for a\ngossip--it was a bustling day of June--across a long stretch of the\ntown; when I left her at a glittering portal with the impression of my\nhaving in our transit seen much of Society (the old London \"season\"\nfilled the measure, had length and breadth and thickness, to an extent\nnow foregone,) and, more particularly, achieved a small psychologic\nstudy, noted the action of the massive English machinery directed to its\nend, which had been in this case effectually to tame the presumptuous\nand \"work over\" the crude. I remember on that occasion retracing my\nsteps from Eaton Square to Devonshire Street with a lively sense of\nobservation exercised by the way, a perfect gleaning of golden straws.\nOur guide and philosopher of the summer days in Paris was no such\ncharacter as that; she had arrived among us full-fledged and consummate,\nfortunately for the case altogether--as our mere candid humanity would\notherwise have had scant practical pressure to bring. Thackeray's novel\ncontains a plate from his own expressive hand representing Miss Sharp\nlost in a cynical day-dream while her neglected pupils are locked in a\nscrimmage on the floor; but the marvel of _our_ exemplar of the Becky\ntype was exactly that though her larger, her more interested and\nsophisticated views had a range that she not only permitted us to guess\nbut agreeably invited us to follow almost to their furthest limits, we\nnever for a moment ceased to be aware of her solicitude. We might, we\nmust, so tremendously have bored her, but no ironic artist could have\ncaught her at any juncture in the posture of disgust: really, I imagine,\nbecause her own ironies would have been too fine for him and too\nnumerous and too mixed. And this remarkable creature vouchsafed us all\ninformation for the free enjoyment--on the terms proper to our tender\nyears--of her beautiful city.\n\nIt was not by the common measure then so beautiful as now; the second\nEmpire, too lately installed, was still more or less feeling its way,\nwith the great free hand soon to be allowed to Baron Haussmann marked as\nyet but in the light preliminary flourish. Its connections with the\npast, however, still hung thickly on; its majesties and symmetries,\ncomparatively vague and general, were subject to the happy accident, the\ncharming lapse and the odd extrusion, a bonhomie of chance composition\nand colour now quite purged away. The whole region of the\nChamps-Elys\u00c3\u00a9es, where we must after all at first have principally\nprowled, was another world from the actual huge centre of repeated\nradiations; the splendid Avenue, as we of course already thought it,\ncarried the eye from the Tuileries to the Arch, but pleasant old places\nabutted on it by the way, gardens and terraces and h\u00c3\u00b4tels of another\ntime, pavilions still braver than ours, cabarets and caf\u00c3\u00a9s of homely,\nalmost of rural type, with a relative and doubtless rather dusty\nruralism, spreading away to the River and the Wood. What was the Jardin\nd'Hiver, a place of entertainment standing quite over against us and\nthat looped itself at night with little coloured oil-lamps, a mere\ntwinkling grin upon the face of pleasure? Dim my impression of having\nbeen admitted--or rather, I suppose, conducted, though under\nconductorship now vague to me--to view it by colourless day, when it\nmust have worn the stamp of an auction-room quite void of the \"lots.\"\nMore distinct on the other hand the image of the bustling barri\u00c3\u00a8re at\nthe top of the Avenue, on the hither side of the Arch, where the old\nloose-girt _banlieue_ began at once and the two matched lodges of the\noctroi, highly, that is expressly even if humbly, architectural, guarded\nthe entrance, on either side, with such a suggestion of the generations\nand dynasties and armies, the revolutions and restorations they had\nseen come and go. But the Avenue of the Empress, now, so much more\nthinly, but of the Wood itself, had already been traced, as the Empress\nherself, young, more than young, attestedly and agreeably _new_, and\nfair and shining, was, up and down the vista, constantly on exhibition;\nwith the thrill of that surpassed for us, however, by the incomparable\npassage, as we judged it, of the baby Prince Imperial borne forth for\nhis airing or his progress to Saint-Cloud in the splendid coach that\ngave a glimpse of appointed and costumed nursing breasts and laps, and\nbeside which the _cent-gardes_, all light-blue and silver and intensely\nerect quick jolt, rattled with pistols raised and cocked. Was a public\nholiday ever more splendid than that of the Prince's baptism at Notre\nDame, the f\u00c3\u00aate of Saint-Napol\u00c3\u00a9on, or was any ever more immortalised, as\nwe say, than this one was to be by the wonderfully ample and vivid\npicture of it in the Eug\u00c3\u00a8ne Rougon of Emile Zola, who must have taken it\nin, on the spot, as a boy of about our own number of years, though of so\nmuch more implanted and predestined an evocatory gift? The sense of that\ninterminable hot day, a day of hanging about and waiting and shuffling\nin dust, in crowds, in fatigue, amid booths and pedlars and performers\nand false alarms and expectations and renewed reactions and rushes, all\ntransfigured at the last, withal, by the biggest and brightest\nillumination up to that time offered even the Parisians, the blinding\nglare of the new Empire effectually symbolised--the vision of the whole,\nI say, comes back to me quite in the form of a chapter from the\nRougon-Macquart, with its effect of something long and dense and heavy,\nwithout shades or undertones, but immensely kept-up and done. I dare say\nthat for those months our contemplations, our daily exercise in general,\nstrayed little beyond the Champs-Elys\u00c3\u00a9es, though I recall confusedly as\nwell certain excursions to Passy and Auteuil, where we foregathered with\nsmall resident compatriots the easy gutturalism of whose French, an\nunpremeditated art, was a revelation, an initiation, and whence we\nroamed, for purposes of picnic, into parts of the Bois de Boulogne that,\noddly enough, figured to us the virgin forest better than anything at\nour own American door had done.\n\nIt was the social aspect of our situation that most appealed to me, none\nthe less--for I detect myself, as I woo it all back, disengaging a\nsocial aspect again, and more than ever, from the phenomena disclosed to\nmy reflective gape or to otherwise associated strolls; perceptive\npassages not wholly independent even of the occupancy of two-sous chairs\nwithin the charmed circle of Guignol and of Gringalet. I suppose I\nshould have blushed to confess it, but Polichinelle and his puppets, in\nthe afternoons, under an umbrage sparse till evening fell, had still\ntheir spell to cast--as part and parcel, that is, of the general\nintensity of animation and variety of feature. The \"amusement,\" the\n\u00c3\u00a6sthetic and human appeal, of Paris had in those days less the air of a\ngreat shining conspiracy to please, the machinery in movement confessed\nless to its huge purpose; but manners and types and traditions, the\ndetail of the scene, its pointed particulars, went their way with a\nstraighter effect, as well as often with a homelier grace--character,\ntemper and tone had lost comparatively little of their emphasis. These\nscattered accents were matter for our eyes and ears--not a little even\nalready for our respective imaginations; though it is only as the season\nwaned and we set up our fireside afresh and for the winter that I\nconnect my small revolution with a wider field and with the company of\nW. J. Again for that summer he was to be in eclipse to me; Guignol and\nGringalet failed to claim his attention, and Mademoiselle Danse, I make\nout, deprecated his theory of exact knowledge, besides thinking him\nperhaps a little of an _ours_--which came to the same thing. We\nadjourned that autumn to quarters not far off, a wide-faced apartment in\nthe street then bravely known as the Rue d'Angoul\u00c3\u00aame-St.-Honor\u00c3\u00a9 and now,\nafter other mutations, as the Rue La Bo\u00c3\u00abtie; which we were again to\nexchange a year later for an abode in the Rue Montaigne, this last\nafter a summer's absence at Boulogne-sur-Mer; the earlier migration\nsetting up for me the frame of a considerably animated picture. Animated\nat best it was with the spirit and the modest facts of our family life,\namong which I number the cold finality of M. Lerambert, reflected in\nstill other testimonies--that is till the date of our definite but\nrespectful rupture with him, followed as the spring came on by our\nineluctable phase at the Institution Fezandi\u00c3\u00a9 in the Rue Balzac; of\nwhich latter there will be even more to say than I shall take freedom\nfor. With the Rue d'Angoul\u00c3\u00aame came extensions--even the mere immediate\nview of opposite intimacies and industries, the subdivided aspects and\nneat ingenuities of the applied Parisian genius counting as such: our\nmany-windowed _premier_, above an entresol of no great height, hung over\nthe narrow and, during the winter months, not a little dusky channel,\nwith endless movement and interest in the vivid exhibition it supplied.\nWhat faced us was a series of subjects, with the baker, at the corner,\nfor the first--the impeccable dispenser of the so softly-crusty\ncrescent-rolls that we woke up each morning to hunger for afresh, with\nour weak caf\u00c3\u00a9-au-lait, as for the one form of \"European\" breakfast-bread\nfit to be named even with the feeblest of our American forms. Then came\nthe small cr\u00c3\u00aamerie, white picked out with blue, which, by some secret\nof its own keeping, afforded, within the compass of a few feet square,\nprolonged savoury meals to working men, white-frocked or blue-frocked,\nto uniformed cabmen, stout or spare, but all more or less audibly\n_bavards_ and discernibly critical; and next the compact embrasure of\nthe \u00c3\u00a9caill\u00c3\u00a8re or oyster-lady, she and her paraphernalia fitted into\ntheir interstice much as the mollusc itself into its shell; neighboured\nin turn by the marchand-de-bois, peeping from as narrow a cage, his neat\nfaggots and chopped logs stacked beside him and above him in his\nsentry-box quite as the niches of saints, in early Italian pictures, are\nframed with tightly-packed fruits and flowers. Space and remembrance\nfail me for the rest of the series, the attaching note of which comes\nback as the note of diffused sociability and domestic, in fact more or\nless \u00c3\u00a6sthetic, ingenuity, with the street a perpetual parlour or\nhousehold centre for the flitting, pausing, conversing little bourgeoise\nor ouvri\u00c3\u00a8re to sport, on every pretext and in every errand, her fluted\ncap, her composed head, her neat ankles and her ready wit. Which is to\nsay indeed but that life and manners were more pointedly and\nharmoniously expressed, under our noses there, than we had perhaps found\nthem anywhere save in the most salient passages of \"stories\"; though I\nmust in spite of it not write as if these trifles were all our fare.\n\n\n\n\nXXV\n\n\nThat autumn renewed, I make out, our long and beguiled walks, my own\nwith W. J. in especial; at the same time that I have somehow the sense\nof the whole more broken appeal on the part of Paris, the scanter\nconfidence and ease it inspired in us, the perhaps more numerous and\ncomposite, but obscurer and more baffled intimations. Not indeed--for\nall my brother's later vision of an accepted flatness in it--that there\nwas not some joy and some grasp; why else were we forever (as I seem to\nconceive we were) measuring the great space that separated us from the\ngallery of the Luxembourg, every step of which, either way we took it,\nfed us with some interesting, some admirable image, kept us in relation\nto something nobly intended? That particular walk was not prescribed us,\nyet we appear to have hugged it, across the Champs-Elys\u00c3\u00a9es to the river,\nand so over the nearest bridge and the quays of the left bank to the Rue\nde Seine, as if it somehow held the secret of our future; to the extent\neven of my more or less sneaking off on occasion to take it by myself,\nto taste of it with a due undiverted intensity and the throb as of the\nfinest, which _could_ only mean the most Parisian, adventure. The\nfurther quays, with their innumerable old bookshops and print-shops, the\nlong cases of each of these commodities, exposed on the parapets in\nespecial, must have come to know us almost as well as we knew them; with\nplot thickening and emotion deepening steadily, however, as we mounted\nthe long, black Rue de Seine--_such_ a stretch of perspective, _such_ an\nintensity of tone as it offered in those days; where every low-browed\nvitrine waylaid us and we moved in a world of which the dark message,\nexpressed in we couldn't have said what sinister way too, might have\nbeen \"Art, art, art, don't you see? Learn, little gaping pilgrims, what\n_that_ is!\" Oh we learned, that is we tried to, as hard as ever we\ncould, and were fairly well at it, I always felt, even by the time we\nhad passed up into that comparatively short but wider and finer vista of\nthe Rue de Tournon, which in those days more abruptly crowned the more\ncompressed approach and served in a manner as a great outer vestibule to\nthe Palace. Style, dimly described, looked down there, as with conscious\nencouragement, from the high grey-headed, clear-faced, straight-standing\nold houses--very much as if wishing to say \"Yes, small staring jeune\nhomme, we are dignity and memory and measure, we are conscience and\nproportion and taste, not to mention strong sense too: for all of which\ngood things take us--you won't find one of them when you find (as you're\ngoing soon to begin to at such a rate) vulgarity.\" This, I admit, was an\nabundance of remark to such young ears; but it did all, I maintain,\ntremble in the air, with the sense that the Rue de Tournon, cobbled and\na little grass-grown, might more or less have figured some fine old\nstreet _de province_: I cherished in short its very name and think I\nreally hadn't to wait to prefer the then, the unmenaced, the inviolate\nCaf\u00c3\u00a9 Foyot of the left hand corner, the much-loved and so haunted Caf\u00c3\u00a9\nFoyot of the old Paris, to its--well, to its roaring successor. The wide\nmouth of the present Boulevard Saint-Michel, a short way round the\ncorner, had not yet been forced open to the exhibition of more or less\nglittering fangs; old Paris still pressed round the Palace and its\ngardens, which formed the right, the sober social antithesis to the\n\"elegant\" Tuileries, and which in fine, with these renewals of our young\nconfidence, reinforced both in a general and in a particular way one of\nthe fondest of our literary curiosities of that time, the conscientious\nstudy of Les Fran\u00c3\u00a7ais Peints par Eux-M\u00c3\u00aames, rich in wood-cuts of\nGavarni, of Grandville, of Henri-Monnier, which we held it rather our\nduty to admire and W. J. even a little his opportunity to copy in\npen-and-ink. This gilt-edged and double-columned octavo it was that\nfirst disclosed to me, forestalling a better ground of acquaintance, the\ngreat name of Balzac, who, in common with every other \"light\" writer of\nhis day, contributed to its pages: hadn't I pored over his exposition\nthere of the contrasted types of L'Habitu\u00c3\u00a9e des Tuileries and L'Habitu\u00c3\u00a9e\ndu Luxembourg?--finding it very _serr\u00c3\u00a9_, in fact what I didn't then know\nenough to call very stodgy, but flavoured withal and a trifle lubricated\nby Gavarni's two drawings, which had somehow so much, in general, to\nsay.\n\nLet me not however dally by the way, when nothing, at those hours, I\nmake out, so much spoke to us as the animated pictured halls within the\nPalace, primarily those of the Senate of the Empire, but then also\nforming, as with extensions they still and much more copiously form, the\ngreat Paris museum of contemporary art. This array was at that stage a\ncomparatively (though only comparatively) small affair; in spite of\nwhich fact we supposed it vast and final--so that it would have shocked\nus to foreknow how in many a case, and of the most cherished cases, the\nfinality was to break down. Most of the works of the modern schools that\nwe most admired are begging their bread, I fear, from door to door--that\nis from one provincial museum or dim back seat to another; though we\nwere on much-subsequent returns to draw a long breath for the saved\nstate of some of the great things as to which our faith had been\nclearest. It had been clearer for none, I recover, than for Couture's\nRomains de la D\u00c3\u00a9cadence, recently acclaimed, at that time, as the last\nword of the grand manner, but of the grand manner modernised, humanised,\nphilosophised, redeemed from academic death; so that it was to this\nmaster's school that the young American contemporary flutter taught its\nwings to fly straightest, and that I could never, in the long aftertime,\nface his masterpiece and all its old meanings and marvels without a rush\nof memories and a stir of ghosts. William Hunt, the New Englander of\ngenius, the \"Boston painter\" whose authority was greatest during the\nthirty years from 1857 or so, and with whom for a time in the early\nperiod W. J. was to work all devotedly, had prolonged his studies in\nParis under the inspiration of Couture and of Edouard Fr\u00c3\u00a8re; masters in\na group completed by three or four of the so finely interesting\nlandscapists of that and the directly previous age, Troyon, Rousseau,\nDaubigny, even Lambinet and others, and which summed up for the American\ncollector and in the New York and Boston markets the idea of the modern\nin the masterly. It was a comfortable time--when appreciation could go\nso straight, could rise, and rise higher, without critical contortions;\nwhen we could, I mean, be both so intelligent and so \"quiet.\" We were\nin our immediate circle to know Couture himself a little toward the end\nof his life, and I was somewhat to wonder then where he had picked up\nthe \u00c3\u00a6sthetic hint for the beautiful Page with a Falcon, if I have the\ndesignation right, his other great bid for style and capture of\nit--which we were long to continue to suppose perhaps the rarest of all\nmodern pictures. The feasting Romans were conceivable enough, I mean\n_as_ a conception; no mystery hung about them--in the sense of one's\nasking one's self whence they had come and by what romantic or\nroundabout or nobly-dangerous journey; which is that air of the poetic\nshaken out as from strong wings when great presences, in any one of the\narts, appear to alight. What I remember, on the other hand, of the\nsplendid fair youth in black velvet and satin or whatever who, while he\nmounts the marble staircase, shows off the great bird on his forefinger\nwith a grace that shows _him_ off, was that it failed to help us to\ndivine, during that after-lapse of the glory of which I speak, by what\nrare chance, for the obscured old ex-celebrity we visited, the heavens\nhad once opened. Poetry had swooped down, breathed on him for an hour\nand fled. Such at any rate are the see-saws of reputations--which it\ncontributes to the interest of any observational lingering on this\nplanet to have caught so repeatedly in their weird motion; the question\nof what may happen, under one's eyes, in particular cases, before that\nmotion sinks to rest, whether at the up or at the down end, being really\na bribe to one's own non-departure. Especially great the interest of\nhaving noted all the rises and falls and of being able to compare the\nfinal point--so far as any certainty may go as to that--either with the\ngreatest or the least previous altitudes; since it is only when there\nhave been exaltations (which is what is not commonest), that our\nattention is most rewarded.\n\nIf the see-saw was to have operated indeed for Eug\u00c3\u00a8ne Delacroix, our\nnext young admiration, though much more intelligently my brother's than\nmine, that had already taken place and settled, for we were to go on\nseeing him, and to the end, in firm possession of his crown, and to take\neven, I think, a harmless pleasure in our sense of having from so far\nback been sure of it. I was sure of it, I must properly add, but as an\neffect of my brother's sureness; since I must, by what I remember, have\nbeen as sure of Paul Delaroche--for whom the pendulum was at last to be\narrested at a very different point. I could see in a manner, for all the\nqueerness, what W. J. meant by that beauty and, above all, that living\ninterest in La Barque du Dante, where the queerness, according to him,\nwas perhaps what contributed most; see it doubtless in particular when\nhe reproduced the work, at home, from a memory aided by a lithograph.\nYet Les Enfants d'Edouard thrilled me to a different tune, and I\ncouldn't doubt that the long-drawn odd face of the elder prince, sad and\nsore and sick, with his wide crimped side-locks of fair hair and his\nviolet legs marked by the Garter and dangling from the bed, was a\nreconstitution of far-off history of the subtlest and most \"last word\"\nmodern or psychologic kind. I had never heard of psychology in art or\nanywhere else--scarcely anyone then had; but I truly felt the nameless\nforce at play. Thus if I also in my way \"subtly\" admired, one's noted\npractice of that virtue (mainly regarded indeed, I judge, as a vice)\nwould appear to have at the time I refer to set in, under such\nencouragements, once for all; and I can surely have enjoyed up to then\nno formal exhibition of anything as I at one of those seasons enjoyed\nthe commemorative show of Delaroche given, soon after his death, in one\nof the rather bleak salles of the \u00c3\u0089cole des Beaux-Arts to which access\nwas had from the quay. _There_ was reconstituted history if one would,\nin the straw-littered scaffold, the distracted ladies with\nthree-cornered coifs and those immense hanging sleeves that made them\nlook as if they had bath-towels over their arms; in the block, the\nheadsman, the bandaged eyes and groping hands, of Lady Jane Grey--not\nless than in the noble indifference of Charles the First, compromised\nking but perfect gentleman, at his inscrutable ease in his chair and as\nif on his throne, while the Puritan soldiers insult and badger him: the\nthrill of which was all the greater from its pertaining to that English\nlore which the good Robert Thompson had, to my responsive delight,\nrubbed into us more than anything else and all from a fine old\nconservative and monarchical point of view. Yet of these things W. J.\nattempted no reproduction, though I remember his repeatedly laying his\nhand on Delacroix, whom he found always and everywhere interesting--to\nthe point of trying effects, with charcoal and crayon, in his manner;\nand not less in the manner of Decamps, whom we regarded as more or less\nof a genius of the same rare family. They were touched with the\nineffable, the inscrutable, and Delacroix in especial with the\nincalculable; categories these toward which we had even then, by a happy\ntransition, begun to yearn and languish. We were not yet aware of style,\nthough on the way to become so, but were aware of mystery, which indeed\nwas one of its forms--while we saw all the others, without exception,\nexhibited at the Louvre, where at first they simply overwhelmed and\nbewildered me.\n\nIt was as if they had gathered there into a vast deafening chorus; I\nshall never forget how--speaking, that is, for my own sense--they\nfilled those vast halls with the influence rather of some complicated\nsound, diffused and reverberant, than of such visibilities as one could\ndirectly deal with. To distinguish among these, in the charged and\ncoloured and confounding air, was difficult--it discouraged and defied;\nwhich was doubtless why my impression originally best entertained was\nthat of those magnificent parts of the great gallery simply not inviting\nus to distinguish. They only arched over us in the wonder of their\nendless golden riot and relief, figured and flourished in perpetual\nrevolution, breaking into great high-hung circles and symmetries of\nsquandered picture, opening into deep outward embrasures that threw off\nthe rest of monumental Paris somehow as a told story, a sort of wrought\neffect or bold ambiguity for a vista, and yet held it there, at every\npoint, as a vast bright gage, even at moments a felt adventure, of\nexperience. This comes to saying that in those beginnings I felt myself\nmost happily cross that bridge over to Style constituted by the wondrous\nGalerie d'Apollon, drawn out for me as a long but assured initiation and\nseeming to form with its supreme coved ceiling and inordinately shining\nparquet a prodigious tube or tunnel through which I inhaled little by\nlittle, that is again and again, a general sense of _glory_. The glory\nmeant ever so many things at once, not only beauty and art and supreme\ndesign, but history and fame and power, the world in fine raised to the\nrichest and noblest expression. The world there was at the same time, by\nan odd extension or intensification, the local present fact, to my small\nimagination, of the Second Empire, which was (for my notified\nconsciousness) new and queer and perhaps even wrong, but on the spot so\namply radiant and elegant that it took to itself, took under its\nprotection with a splendour of insolence, the state and ancientry of the\nwhole scene, profiting thus, to one's dim historic vision, confusedly\nthough it might be, by the unparalleled luxury and variety of its\nheritage. But who shall count the sources at which an intense young\nfancy (when a young fancy _is_ intense) capriciously, absurdly\ndrinks?--so that the effect is, in twenty connections, that of a\nlove-philtre or fear-philtre which fixes for the senses their supreme\nsymbol of the fair or the strange. The Galerie d'Apollon became for\nyears what I can only term a splendid scene of things, even of the quite\nirrelevant or, as might be, almost unworthy; and I recall to this hour,\nwith the last vividness, what a precious part it played for me, and\nexactly by that continuity of honour, on my awaking, in a summer dawn\nmany years later, to the fortunate, the instantaneous recovery and\ncapture of the most appalling yet most admirable nightmare of my life.\nThe climax of this extraordinary experience--which stands alone for me\nas a dream-adventure founded in the deepest, quickest, clearest act of\ncogitation and comparison, act indeed of life-saving energy, as well as\nin unutterable fear--was the sudden pursuit, through an open door, along\na huge high saloon, of a just dimly-descried figure that retreated in\nterror before my rush and dash (a glare of inspired reaction from\nirresistible but shameful dread,) out of the room I had a moment before\nbeen desperately, and all the more abjectly, defending by the push of my\nshoulder against hard pressure on lock and bar from the other side. The\nlucidity, not to say the sublimity, of the crisis had consisted of the\ngreat thought that I, in my appalled state, was probably still more\nappalling than the awful agent, creature or presence, whatever he was,\nwhom I had guessed, in the suddenest wild start from sleep, the sleep\nwithin my sleep, to be making for my place of rest. The triumph of my\nimpulse, perceived in a flash as I acted on it by myself at a bound,\nforcing the door outward, was the grand thing, but the great point of\nthe whole was the wonder of my final recognition. Routed, dismayed, the\ntables turned upon him by my so surpassing him for straight aggression\nand dire intention, my visitant was already but a diminished spot in the\nlong perspective, the tremendous, glorious hall, as I say, over the\nfar-gleaming floor of which, cleared for the occasion of its great line\nof priceless vitrines down the middle, he sped for _his_ life, while a\ngreat storm of thunder and lightning played through the deep embrasures\nof high windows at the right. The lightning that revealed the retreat\nrevealed also the wondrous place and, by the same amazing play, my young\nimaginative life in it of long before, the sense of which, deep within\nme, had kept it whole, preserved it to this thrilling use; for what in\nthe world were the deep embrasures and the so polished floor but those\nof the Galerie d'Apollon of my childhood? The \"scene of something\" I had\nvaguely then felt it? Well I might, since it was to be the scene of that\nimmense hallucination.\n\nOf what, at the same time, in those years, were the great rooms of the\nLouvre almost equally, above and below, not the scene, from the moment\nthey so wrought, stage by stage, upon our perceptions?--literally on\nalmost all of these, in one way and another; quite in such a manner, I\nmore and more see, as to have been educative, formative, fertilising, in\na degree which no other \"intellectual experience\" our youth was to know\ncould pretend, as a comprehensive, conducive thing, to rival. The sharp\nand strange, the quite heart-shaking little prevision had come to me,\nfor myself, I make out, on the occasion of our very first visit of all,\nmy brother's and mine, under conduct of the good Jean Nadali,\nbefore-mentioned, trustfully deputed by our parents, in the Rue de la\nPaix, on the morrow of our first arrival in Paris (July 1855) and while\nthey were otherwise concerned. I hang again, appalled but uplifted, on\nbrave Nadali's arm--his professional acquaintance with the splendours\nabout us added for me on the spot to the charm of his \"European\"\ncharacter: I cling to him while I gape at G\u00c3\u00a9ricault's Radeau de la\nM\u00c3\u00a9duse, _the_ sensation, for splendour and terror of interest, of that\njuncture to me, and ever afterwards to be associated, along with two or\nthree other more or less contemporary products, Gu\u00c3\u00a9rin's Burial of\nAtala, Prudhon's Cupid and Psyche, David's helmetted Romanisms, Madame\nVig\u00c3\u00a9e-Lebrun's \"ravishing\" portrait of herself and her little girl, with\nhow can I say what foretaste (as determined by that instant as if the\nhour had struck from a clock) of all the fun, confusedly speaking, that\none was going to have, and the kind of life, always of the queer\nso-called inward sort, tremendously \"sporting\" in its way--though that\ndescription didn't then wait upon it, that one was going to lead. It\ncame of itself, this almost awful apprehension in all the presences,\nunder our courier's protection and in my brother's company--it came just\nthere and so; there was alarm in it somehow as well as bliss. The bliss\nin fact I think scarce disengaged itself at all, but only the sense of\na freedom of contact and appreciation really too big for one, and\nleaving such a mark on the very place, the pictures, the frames\nthemselves, the figures within them, the particular parts and features\nof each, the look of the rich light, the smell of the massively enclosed\nair, that I have never since renewed the old exposure without renewing\nagain the old emotion and taking up the small scared consciousness.\n_That_, with so many of the conditions repeated, is the charm--to feel\nafresh the beginning of so much that was to be. The beginning in short\nwas with G\u00c3\u00a9ricault and David, but it went on and on and slowly spread;\nso that one's stretched, one's even strained, perceptions, one's\ndiscoveries and extensions piece by piece, come back, on the great\npremises, almost as so many explorations of the house of life, so many\ncirclings and hoverings round the image of the world. I have dim\nreminiscences of permitted independent visits, uncorrectedly juvenile\nthough I might still be, during which the house of life and the palace\nof art became so mixed and interchangeable--the Louvre being, under a\ngeneral description, the most peopled of all scenes not less than the\nmost hushed of all temples--that an excursion to look at pictures would\nhave but half expressed my afternoon. I had looked at pictures, looked\nand looked again, at the vast Veronese, at Murillo's moon-borne\nMadonna, at Leonardo's almost unholy dame with the folded hands,\ntreasures of the Salon Carr\u00c3\u00a9 as that display was then composed; but I\nhad also looked at France and looked at Europe, looked even at America\nas Europe itself might be conceived so to look, looked at history, as a\nstill-felt past and a complacently personal future, at society, manners,\ntypes, characters, possibilities and prodigies and mysteries of fifty\nsorts; and all in the light of being splendidly \"on my own,\" as I\nsupposed it, though we hadn't then that perfection of slang, and of (in\nespecial) going and coming along that interminable and incomparable\nSeine-side front of the Palace against which young sensibility felt\nitself almost rub, for endearment and consecration, as a cat invokes the\nfriction of a protective piece of furniture. Such were at any rate some\nof the vague processes--I see for how utterly vague they must show--of\npicking up an education; and I was, in spite of the vagueness, so far\nfrom agreeing with my brother afterwards that we didn't pick one up and\nthat that never _is_ done, in any sense not negligible, and also that an\neducation might, or should, in particular, have picked _us_ up, and yet\ndidn't--I was so far dissentient, I say, that I think I quite came to\nglorify such passages and see them as part of an order really fortunate.\nIf we had been little asses, I seem to have reasoned, a higher\nintention driving us wouldn't have made us less so--to any point worth\nmentioning; and as we extracted such impressions, to put it at the\nworst, from redemptive accidents (to call Louvres and Luxembourgs\nnothing better) why we weren't little asses, but something wholly other:\nwhich appeared all I needed to contend for. Above all it would have been\nstupid and ignoble, an attested and lasting dishonour, not, with our\nchance, to have followed our straggling clues, as many as we could and\ndisengaging as we happily did, I felt, the gold and the silver ones,\nwhatever the others might have been--not to have followed them and not\nto have arrived by them, so far as we were to arrive. Instinctively, for\nany dim designs we might have nourished, we picked out the silver and\nthe gold, attenuated threads though they must have been, and I\npositively feel that there were more of these, far more, casually\ninterwoven, than will reward any present patience for my unravelling of\nthe too fine tissue.\n\n\n\n\nXXVI\n\n\nI allude of course in particular here to the \u00c3\u00a6sthetic clue in general,\nwith which it was that we most (or that I at any rate most) fumbled,\nwithout our in the least having then, as I have already noted, any such\nrare name for it. There were sides on which it fairly dangled about us,\ninvolving our small steps and wits; though others too where I could, for\nmy own part, but clutch at it in the void. Our experience of the theatre\nfor instance, which had played such a part for us at home, almost wholly\ndropped in just the most propitious air: an anomaly indeed half\nexplained by the fact that life in general, all round us, was\nperceptibly more theatrical. And there were other reasons, whether\ndefinitely set before us or not, which we grasped in proportion as we\ngathered, by depressing hearsay, that the French drama, great, strange\nand important, was as much out of relation to our time of life, our so\nlittle native strain and our cultivated innocence, as the American and\nEnglish had been directly addressed to them. To the Cirque d'\u00c3\u0089t\u00c3\u00a9, the\nCirque d'Hiver, the Th\u00c3\u00a9\u00c3\u00a2tre du Cirque we were on occasion conducted--we\nhad fallen so to the level of circuses, and that name appeared a\nsafety; in addition to which the big theatre most bravely bearing it,\nthe especial home at that time of the glittering and multitudinous\n_f\u00c3\u00a9erie_, did seem to lift the whole scenic possibility, for our eyes,\ninto a higher sphere of light and grace than any previously disclosed. I\nrecall Le Diable d'Argent as in particular a radiant revelation--kept\nbefore us a whole long evening and as an almost blinding glare; which\nwas quite right for the _donn\u00c3\u00a9e_, the gradual shrinkage of the Shining\nOne, the money-monster hugely inflated at first, to all the successive\ndegrees of loose bagginess as he leads the reckless young man he has\noriginally contracted with from dazzling pleasure to pleasure, till at\nlast he is a mere shrivelled silver string such as you could almost draw\nthrough a keyhole. That was the striking moral, for the young man,\nhowever regaled, had been somehow \"sold\"; which _we_ hadn't in the least\nbeen, who had had all his pleasures and none of his penalty, whatever\nthis was to be. I was to repine a little, in these connections, at a\nmuch later time, on reflecting that had we only been \"taken\" in the\nParis of that period as we had been taken in New York we might have come\nin for celebrities--supremely fine, perhaps supremely rank, flowers of\nthe histrionic temperament, springing as they did from the soil of the\nrichest romanticism and adding to its richness--who practised that\nbraver art and finer finish which a comparatively homogenous public,\nforming a compact critical body, still left possible. Rachel was alive,\nbut dying; the memory of Mademoiselle Mars, at her latest, was still in\nthe air; Mademoiselle Georges, a massive, a monstrous antique, had\nwithal returned for a season to the stage; but we missed her, as we\nmissed D\u00c3\u00a9jazet and Fr\u00c3\u00a9d\u00c3\u00a9ric Lem\u00c3\u00a2itre and M\u00c3\u00a9lingue and Samson; to say\nnothing of others of the age before the flood--taking for the flood that\nactual high tide of the outer barbarian presence, the general alien and\npolyglot, in stalls and boxes, which I remember to have heard Gustave\nFlaubert lament as the ruin of the theatre through the assumption of\njudgeship by a bench to whom the very values of the speech of author and\nactor were virtually closed, or at the best uncertain.\n\nI enjoyed but two snatches of the older representational art--no\nparticular of either of which, however, has faded from me; the earlier\nand rarer of these an evening at the Gymnase for a _spectacle coup\u00c3\u00a9_,\nwith Mesdames Rose Ch\u00c3\u00a9ri, M\u00c3\u00a9lanie, Delaporte and Victoria (afterwards\nVictoria-La-fontaine). I squeeze again with my mother, my aunt and my\nbrother into the stuffy baignoire, and I take to my memory in especial\nMadame de Girardin's Une Femme qui D\u00c3\u00a9teste son Mari; the thrilling\nstory, as I judged it, of an admirable lady who, to save her loyalist\nhusband, during the Revolution, feigns the most Jacobin opinions,\nrepresents herself a citoyenne of citoyennes, in order to keep him the\nmore safely concealed in her house. He flattens himself, to almost\ngreater peril of life, behind a panel of the wainscot, which she has a\nsecret for opening when he requires air and food and they may for a\nfearful fleeting instant be alone together; and the point of the picture\nis in the contrast between these melting moments and the heroine's\n_tenue_ under the tremendous strain of receiving on the one side the\ninvading, investigating Terrorist commissaries, sharply suspicious but\nsuccessfully baffled, and on the other her noble relatives, her\nhusband's mother and sister if I rightly remember, who are not in the\nsecret and whom, for perfect prudence, she keeps out of it, though alone\nwith her, and themselves in hourly danger, they might be trusted, and\nwho, believing him concealed elsewhere and terribly tracked, treat her,\nin her republican rage, as lost to all honour and all duty. One's sense\nof such things after so long a time has of course scant authority for\nothers; but I myself trust my vision of Rose Ch\u00c3\u00a9ri's fine play just as I\ntrust that of her _physique ingrat_, her at first extremely odd and\npositively osseous appearance; an emaciated woman with a high bulging\nforehead, somewhat of the form of Rachel's, for whom the triumphs of\nproduced illusion, as in the second, third and fourth great dramas of\nthe younger Dumas, had to be triumphs indeed. My one other reminiscence\nof this order connects itself, and quite three years later, with the old\ndingy Vaudeville of the Place de la Bourse, where I saw in my brother's\ncompany a rhymed domestic drama of the then still admired Ponsard, Ce\nqui Pla\u00c3\u00aet aux Femmes; a piece that enjoyed, I believe, scant success,\nbut that was to leave with me ineffaceable images. How was it possible,\nI wondered, to have more grace and talent, a rarer, cooler art, than\nMademoiselle Fargeuil, the heroine?--the fine lady whom a pair of rival\nlovers, seeking to win her hand by offering her what will most please\nher, treat, in the one case, to a brilliant f\u00c3\u00aate, a little play within a\nplay, at which we assist, and in the other to the inside view of an\nattic of misery, into which the more cunning suitor introduces her just\nin time to save a poor girl, the tenant of the place, from being\nruinously, that is successfully, tempted by a terrible old woman, a\nprowling _revendeuse_, who dangles before her the condition on which so\npretty a person may enjoy every comfort. Her happier sister, the courted\nyoung widow, intervenes in time, reinforces her tottering virtue, opens\nfor her an account with baker and butcher, and, doubting no longer which\nflame is to be crowned, charmingly shows us that what pleases women most\nis the exercise of charity.\n\nThen it was I first beheld that extraordinary veteran of the stage,\nMademoiselle Pierson, almost immemorially attached, for later\ngenerations, to the Th\u00c3\u00a9\u00c3\u00a2tre Fran\u00c3\u00a7ais, the span of whose career thus\nstrikes me as fabulous, though she figured as a very juvenile beauty in\nthe small _f\u00c3\u00a9erie_ or allegory forming M. Ponsard's second act. She has\nbeen playing mothers and aunts this many and many a year--and still\nindeed much as a juvenile beauty. Not that light circumstance, however,\npleads for commemoration, nor yet the further fact that I was to admire\nMademoiselle Fargeuil, in the after-time, the time after she had given\nall Sardou's earlier successes the help of her shining firmness, when\nshe had passed from interesting comedy and even from romantic drama--not\nless, perhaps still more, interesting, with Sardou's Patrie as a\nbridge--to the use of the bigger brush of the Ambigu and other homes of\nmelodrama. The sense, such as it is, that I extract from the pair of\nmodest memories in question is rather their value as a glimpse of the\nold order that spoke so much less of our hundred modern material\nresources, matters the stage of to-day appears mainly to live by, and\nsuch volumes more of the one thing that was then, and that, given\nvarious other things, had to be, of the essence. That one thing was the\nquality, to say nothing of the quantity, of the actor's personal\nresource, technical history, tested temper, proved experience; on which\nalmost everything had to depend, and the thought of which makes the mere\nstarved scene and medium of the period, the _rest_ of the picture, a\nmore confessed and more heroic battle-ground. They have been more and\nmore eased off, the scene and medium, for our couple of generations, so\nmuch so in fact that the rest of the picture has become almost _all_ the\npicture: the author and the producer, among us, lift the weight of the\nplay from the performer--particularly of the play dealing with our\nimmediate life and manners and aspects--after a fashion which does half\nthe work, thus reducing the \"personal equation,\" the demand for the\nmaximum of individual doing, to a contribution mostly of the loosest and\nsparest. As a sop to historic curiosity at all events may even so short\nan impression serve; impression of the strenuous age and its fine old\nmasterful _assouplissement_ of its victims--who were not the expert\nspectators. The spectators were so expert, so broken in to material\nsuffering for the sake of their passion, that, as the suffering was only\nmaterial, they found the \u00c3\u00a6sthetic reward, the critical relish of the\nessence, all adequate; a fact that seems in a sort to point a moral of\nlarge application. Everything but the \"interpretation,\" the personal, in\nthe French theatre of those days, had kinds and degrees of weakness and\nfutility, say even falsity, of which our modern habit is wholly\nimpatient--let alone other conditions still that were detestable even at\nthe time, and some of which, forms of discomfort and annoyance, linger\non to this day. The playhouse, in short, was almost a place of physical\ntorture, and it is still rarely in Paris a place of physical ease. Add\nto this the old thinness of the school of Scribe and the old emptiness\nof the thousand vaudevillistes; which part of the exhibition, till\nmodern comedy began, under the younger Dumas and Augier, had for its\ncounterpart but the terrible dead weight, or at least the prodigious\nprolixity and absurdity, of much, not to say of most, of the romantic\nand melodramatic \"output.\" It _paid_ apparently, in the golden age of\nacting, to sit through interminable evenings in impossible places--since\nto assume that the age _was_ in that particular respect golden (for\nwhich we have in fact a good deal of evidence) alone explains the\npatience of the public. With the public the _actors_ were, according to\ntheir seasoned strength, almost exclusively appointed to deal, just as\nin the conditions most familiar to-day to ourselves this charge is laid\non almost everyone concerned in the case save the representatives of the\nparts. And far more other people are now concerned than of old; not\nleast those who have learned to make the playhouse endurable. All of\nwhich leaves us with this interesting vision of a possibly great truth,\nthe truth that you can't have more than one kind of intensity--intensity\nworthy of the name--at once. The intensity of the golden age of the\nhistrion was the intensity of _his_ good faith. The intensity of our\nperiod is that of the \"producer's\" and machinist's, to which add even\nthat of architect, author and critic. Between which derivative kind of\nthat article, as we may call it, and the other, the immediate kind, it\nwould appear that you have absolutely to choose.\n\n\n\n\nXXVII\n\n\nI see much of the rest of that particular Paris time in the light of the\nInstitution Fezandi\u00c3\u00a9, and I see the Institution Fezandi\u00c3\u00a9, Rue Balzac, in\nthe light, if not quite of Alphonse Daudet's lean asylum for the _petits\npays chauds_, of which I have felt the previous institutions of New York\nsketchily remind me, at least in that of certain other of his studies in\nthat field of the precarious, the ambiguous Paris over parts of which\nthe great Arch at the top of the Champs-Elys\u00c3\u00a9es flings, at its hours, by\nits wide protective plausible shadow, a precious mantle of \"tone.\" They\ngather, these chequered parts, into its vast paternal presence and enjoy\nat its expense a degree of reflected dignity. It was to the big square\nvilla of the Rue Balzac that we turned, as pupils not unacquainted with\nvicissitudes, from a scene swept bare of M. Lerambert, an establishment\nthat strikes me, at this distance of time, as of the oddest and most\nindescribable--or as describable at best in some of the finer turns and\ntouches of Daudet's best method. The picture indeed should not be\ninvidious--it so little needs that, I feel, for its due measure of the\nvivid, the queer, the droll, all coming back to me without prejudice to\nits air as of an equally futile felicity. I see it as bright and loose\nand vague, as confused and embarrassed and helpless; I see it, I fear,\nas quite ridiculous, but as wholly harmless to my brothers and me at\nleast, and as having left us with a fund of human impressions; it played\nbefore us such a variety of figure and character and so relieved us of a\nsense of untoward discipline or of the pursuit of abstract knowledge. It\nwas a recreational, or at least a social, rather than a tuitional house;\nwhich fact had, I really believe, weighed favourably with our parents,\nwhen, bereft of M. Lerambert, they asked themselves, with their\nconsiderable practice, how next to bestow us. Our father, like so many\nfree spirits of that time in New York and Boston, had been much\ninterested in the writings of Charles Fourier and in his scheme of the\n\"phalanstery\" as the solution of human troubles, and it comes to me that\nhe must have met or in other words heard of M. Fezandi\u00c3\u00a9 as an active and\nsympathetic ex-Fourierist (I think there were only ex-Fourierists by\nthat time,) who was embarking, not far from us, on an experiment if not\nabsolutely phalansteric at least inspired, or at any rate enriched, by a\nbold idealism. I like to think of the Institution as all but\nphalansteric--it so corrects any fear that such places might be dreary.\nI recall this one as positively gay--bristling and bustling and\nresonant, untouched by the strenuous note, for instance, of Hawthorne's\nco-operative Blithedale. I like to think that, in its then still almost\nsuburban, its pleasantly heterogeneous quarter, now oppressively\nuniform, it was close to where Balzac had ended his life, though I\nquestion its identity--as for a while I tried not to--with the scene\nitself of the great man's catastrophe. Round its high-walled garden at\nall events he would have come and gone--a throb of inference that had\nfor some years indeed to be postponed for me; though an association\ndisplacing to-day, over the whole spot, every other interest. I in any\ncase can't pretend not to have been most appealed to by that especial\nphase of our education from which the pedagogic process as commonly\nunderstood was most fantastically absent. It excelled in this respect,\nthe Fezandi\u00c3\u00a9 phase, even others exceptionally appointed, heaven knows,\nfor the supremacy; and yet its glory is that it was no poor blank, but\nthat it fairly creaked and groaned, heatedly overflowed, with its\nwealth. We were _externes_, the three of us, but we remained in general\nto luncheon; coming home then, late in the afternoon, with an almost\nsore experience of multiplicity and vivacity of contact. For the beauty\nof it all was that the Institution was, speaking technically, not more a\n_pensionnat_, with prevailingly English and American pupils, than a\n_pension_, with mature beneficiaries of both sexes, and that our two\ncategories were shaken up together to the liveliest effect. This had\nbeen M. Fezandi\u00c3\u00a9's grand conception; a son of the south, bald and\nslightly replete, with a delicate beard, a quick but anxious, rather\nmelancholy eye and a slim, graceful, juvenile wife, who multiplied\nherself, though scarce knowing at moments, I think, where or how to\nturn; I see him as a Daudet _m\u00c3\u00a9ridional_, but of the sensitive, not the\nsensual, type, as something of a rolling stone, rolling rather down\nhill--he had enjoyed some arrested, possibly blighted, connection in\nAmerica--and as ready always again for some new application of faith and\nfunds. If fondly failing in the least to see why the particular\napplication in the Rue Balzac--the body of pensioners ranging from\ninfancy to hoary eld--shouldn't have been a bright success could have\nmade it one, it would have been a most original triumph.\n\nI recover it as for ourselves a beautifully mixed adventure, a brave\nlittle seeing of the world on the happy pretext of \"lessons.\" We _had_\nlessons from time to time, but had them in company with ladies and\ngentlemen, young men and young women of the Anglo-Saxon family, who sat\nat long boards of green cloth with us and with several of our\ncontemporaries, English and American boys, taking _dict\u00c3\u00a9es_ from the\nhead of the house himself or from the aged and most remarkable M.\nBonnefons, whom we believed to have been a superannuated actor (he above\nall such a model for Daudet!) and who interrupted our abashed readings\naloud to him of the French classics older and newer by wondrous\nreminiscences and even imitations of Talma. He moved among us in a cloud\nof legend, the wigged and wrinkled, the impassioned, though I think alas\nunderfed, M. Bonnefons: it was our belief that he \"went back,\" beyond\nthe first Empire, to the scenes of the Revolution--this perhaps partly\nby reason, in the first place, of his scorn of our pronunciation, when\nwe met it, of the sovereign word _libert\u00c3\u00a9_, the poverty of which, our\ndeplorable \"libbet\u00c3\u00a9,\" without r's, he mimicked and derided, sounding the\nright, the revolutionary form out splendidly, with thirty r's, the\nprolonged beat of a drum. And then we believed him, if artistically\nconservative, politically obnoxious to the powers that then were, though\nknowing that those so marked had to walk, and even to breathe,\ncautiously for fear of the _mouchards_ of the tyrant; we knew all about\nmouchards and talked of them as we do to-day of aviators or\nsuffragettes--to remember which in an age so candidly unconscious of\nthem is to feel how much history we have seen unrolled. There were times\nwhen he but paced up and down and round the long table--I see him as\nnever seated, but always on the move, a weary Wandering Jew of the\n_classe_; but in particular I hear him recite to us the combat with the\nMoors from Le Cid and show us how Talma, describing it, seemed to crouch\ndown on his haunches in order to spring up again terrifically to the\nheight of \"Nous nous levons alors!\" which M. Bonnefons rendered as if on\nthe carpet there fifty men at least had leaped to their feet. But he\nthrew off these broken lights with a quick relapse to indifference; he\ndidn't like the Anglo-Saxon--of the children of Albion at least his view\nwas low; on his American specimens he had, I observed, more mercy; and\nthis imperfection of sympathy (the question of Waterloo apart) rested,\nit was impossible not to feel, on his so resenting the dishonour\nsuffered at our hands by his beautiful tongue, to which, as the great\nfield of elocution, he was patriotically devoted. I think he fairly\nloathed our closed English vowels and confused consonants, our\ndestitution of sounds that he recognised as sounds; though why in this\nconnection he put up best with our own compatriots, embroiled at that\ntime often in even stranger vocables than now, is more than I can say. I\nthink that would be explained perhaps by his feeling in them as an old\nequalitarian certain accessibilities _quand m\u00c3\u00aame_. Besides, we of the\nyounger persuasion at least must have done his ear less violence than\nthose earnest ladies from beyond the sea and than those young Englishmen\nqualifying for examinations and careers who flocked with us both to the\nplausibly spread and the severely disgarnished table, and on whose part\nI seem to see it again an effort of anguish to \"pick up\" the happy idiom\nthat we had unconsciously acquired. French, in the fine old formula of\nthose days, so much diffused, \"was the language of the family\"; but I\nthink it must have appeared to these students in general a family of\nwhich the youngest members were but scantly kept in their place. We\npiped with a greater facility and to a richer meed of recognition; which\nsounds as if we might have become, in these strange collocations, fairly\noffensive little prigs. That was none the less not the case, for there\nwere, oddly enough, a few French boys as well, to whom on the lingual or\nthe \"family\" ground, we felt ourselves feebly relative, and in\ncomparison with whom, for that matter, or with one of whom, I remember\nan occasion of my having to sink to insignificance. There was at the\nInstitution little of a staff--besides waiters and bonnes; but it\nembraced, such as it was, M. Mesnard as well as M. Bonnefons--M. Mesnard\nof the new generation, instructor in whatever it might be, among the\narts, that didn't consist of our rolling our r's, and with them, to help\nus out, more or less our eyes. It is significant that this elegant\nbranch is now quite vague to me; and I recall M. Mesnard, in fine, as no\nless modern and cheap than M. Bonnefons was rare and unappraiseable. He\nhad nevertheless given me his attention, one morning, doubtless\npatiently enough, in some corner of the villa that we had for the moment\npractically to ourselves--I seem to see a small empty room looking on\nthe garden; when there entered to us, benevolently ushered by Madame\nFezandi\u00c3\u00a9, a small boy of very fair and romantic aspect, as it struck me,\na pupil newly arrived. I remember of him mainly that he had a sort of\nnimbus of light curls, a face delicate and pale and that deeply hoarse\nvoice with which French children used to excite our wonder. M. Mesnard\nasked of him at once, with interest, his name, and on his pronouncing it\nsought to know, with livelier attention, if he were then the son of M.\nArs\u00c3\u00a8ne Houssaye, lately director of the Th\u00c3\u00a9\u00c3\u00a2tre Fran\u00c3\u00a7ais. To this\ndistinction the boy confessed--all to such intensification of our\nr\u00c3\u00a9p\u00c3\u00a9titeur's interest that I knew myself quite dropped, in comparison,\nfrom his scheme of things. Such an origin as our little visitor's\naffected him visibly as dazzling, and I felt justified after a while, in\nstealing away into the shade. The beautiful little boy was to live to be\nthe late M. Henry Houssaye, the shining hellenist and historian. I have\nnever forgotten the ecstasy of hope in M. Mesnard's question--as a\nlight on the reverence then entertained for the institution M. Houssaye\nthe elder had administered.\n\n\n\n\nXXVIII\n\n\nThere comes to me, in spite of these memories of an extended connection,\na sense as of some shrinkage or decline in the _beaux jours_ of the\nInstitution; which seems to have found its current run a bit thick and\ntroubled, rather than with the pleasant plash in which we at first\nappeared all equally to bathe. I gather, as I try to reconstitute, that\nthe general enterprise simply proved a fantasy not workable, and that at\nany rate the elders, and often such queer elders, tended to outnumber\nthe candid _jeunesse_; so that I wonder by the same token on what theory\nof the Castalian spring, as taught there to trickle, if not to flow, M.\nHoussaye, holding his small son by the heel as it were, may have been\nmoved to dip him into our well. Shall I blush to relate that my own\nimpression of its virtue must have come exactly from this uncanny turn\ntaken--and quite in spite of the high Fezandi\u00c3\u00a9 ideals--by the\n_invraisemblable_ house of entertainment where the assimilation of no\nform of innocence was doubted of by reason of the forms of experience\nthat insisted somehow on cropping up, and no form of experience too\ndirectly deprecated by reason of the originally plotted tender growths\nof innocence. And some of these shapes were precisely those from which\nour good principal may well have first drawn his liveliest reassurance:\nI seem to remember such ancient American virgins in especial and such\nodd and either distinctively long-necked or more particularly\nlong-haired and chinless compatriots, in black frock-coats of no type or\n\"cut,\" no suggested application at all as garments--application, that\nis, to anything in the nature of character or circumstance, function or\nposition--gathered about in the groups that M. Bonnefons almost\nterrorised by his refusal to recognise, among the barbarous races, any\napproach to his view of the great principle of Diction. I remember\ndeeply and privately enjoying some of his shades of scorn and seeing\nhow, given his own background, they were thoroughly founded; I remember\nabove all as burnt in by the impression he gave me of the creature\n_wholly_ animated and containing no waste expressional spaces, no\nimaginative flatnesses, the notion of the luxury of life, though indeed\nof the amount of trouble of it too, when _none_ of the letters of the\nalphabet of sensibility might be dropped, involved in being a Frenchman.\nThe liveliest lesson I must have drawn, however, from that source makes\nin any case, at the best, an odd educational connection, given the kind\nof concentration at which education, even such as ours, is supposed\nespecially to aim: I speak of that direct promiscuity of insights which\nmight easily have been pronounced profitless, with their attendant\nimpressions and quickened sensibilities--yielding, as these last did,\nharvests of apparitions. I positively cherish at the present hour the\nfond fancy that we all soaked in some such sublime element as might\nstill have hung about there--I mean on the very spot--from the vital\npresence, so lately extinct, of the prodigious Balzac; which had\ninvolved, as by its mere respiration, so dense a cloud of other\npresences, so arrayed an army of interrelated shades, that the air was\nstill thick as with the fumes of witchcraft, with infinite seeing and\nsupposing and creating, with a whole imaginative traffic. The Pension\nVauquer, then but lately existent, according to Le P\u00c3\u00a8re Goriot, on the\nother side of the Seine, was still to be revealed to me; but the figures\npeopling it are not to-day essentially more intense (that is as a matter\nof the marked and featured, the terrible and the touching, as compared\nwith the paleness of the conned page in general,) than I persuade\nmyself, with so little difficulty, that I found the more numerous and\nmore shifting, though properly doubtless less inspiring, constituents of\nthe Pension Fezandi\u00c3\u00a9. Fantastic and all \"subjective\" that I should\nattribute a part of their interest, or that of the scene spreading round\nthem, to any competent perception, in the small-boy mind, that the\ngeneral or public moment had a rarity and a brevity, a sharp intensity,\nof its own; ruffling all things, as they came, with the morning breath\nof the Second Empire and making them twinkle back with a light of\nresigned acceptance, a freshness of cynicism, the force of a great\ngrimacing example. The grimace might have been legibly there in the air,\nto the young apprehension, and could I but simplify this record enough I\nshould represent everything as part of it. I seemed at any rate\nmeanwhile to think of the Fezandi\u00c3\u00a9 young men, young Englishmen mostly,\nwho were getting up their French, in that many-coloured air, for what I\nsupposed, in my candour, to be appointments and \"posts,\" diplomatic,\ncommercial, vaguely official, and who, as I now infer, though I didn't\naltogether embrace it at the time, must, under the loose rule of the\nestablishment, have been amusing themselves not a little. It was as a\nside-wind of their free criticism, I take it, that I felt the first\nchill of an apprehended decline of the establishment, some pang of\nprevision of what might come, and come as with a crash, of the general\nfine fallacy on which it rested. Their criticism was for that matter\nfree enough, causing me to admire it even while it terrified. They\nexpressed themselves in terms of magnificent scorn--such as might\nnaturally proceed, I think I felt, from a mightier race; they spoke of\npoor old Bonnefons, they spoke of our good Fezandi\u00c3\u00a9 himself, they spoke\nmore or less of everyone within view, as beggars and beasts, and I\nremember to have heard on their lips no qualification of any dish served\nto us at d\u00c3\u00aajeuner (and still more at the later meal, of which my\nbrothers and I didn't partake) but as rotten. These were expressions,\nabsent from our domestic, our American air either of fonder\ndiscriminations or vaguer estimates, which fairly extended for me the\nrange of intellectual, or at least of social resource; and as the\ngeneral tone of them to-day comes back to me it floods somehow with\nlight the image of the fine old insular confidence (so intellectually\nunregenerate then that such a name scarce covers it, though inward\nstirrings and the growth of a _comparative_ sense of things have now\nbegun unnaturally to agitate and disfigure it,) in which the general\noutward concussion of the English \"abroad\" with the fact of being abroad\ntook place. The Fezandi\u00c3\u00a9 young men were as much abroad as might be, and\nyet figured to me--largely by the upsetting force of that confidence,\nall but physically exercised--as the finest, handsomest, knowingest\ncreatures; so that when I met them of an afternoon descending the\nChamps-Elys\u00c3\u00a9es with fine long strides and in the costume of the period,\nfor which we can always refer to contemporary numbers of \"Punch,\" the\nfact that I was for the most part walking sedately either with my mother\nor my aunt, or even with my sister and her governess, caused the spark\nof my vision that they were armed for conquest, or at the least for\nadventure, more expansively to glow. I am not sure whether as a general\nthing they honoured me at such instants with a sign of recognition; but\nI recover in especial the sense of an evening hour during which I had\naccompanied my mother to the H\u00c3\u00b4tel Meurice, where one of the New York\ncousins aforementioned, daughter of one of the Albany uncles--that is of\nthe Rhinebeck member of the group--had perched for a time, so\nincongruously, one already seemed to feel, after the sorriest stroke of\nfate. I see again the gaslit glare of the Rue de Rivoli in the spring or\nthe autumn evening (I forget which, for our year of the Rue d'Angoul\u00c3\u00aame\nhad been followed by a migration to the Rue Montaigne, with a period, or\nrather with two periods, of Boulogne-sur-mer interwoven, and we might\nhave made our beguiled way from either domicile); and the whole\nimpression seemed to hang too numerous lamps and too glittering\n_vitrines_ about the poor Pendletons' bereavement, their loss of their\nonly, their so sturdily handsome, little boy, and to suffuse their state\nwith the warm rich exhalations of subterraneous cookery with which I\nfind my recall of Paris from those years so disproportionately and so\nquite other than stomachically charged. The point of all of which is\nsimply that just as we had issued from the hotel, my mother anxiously\nurging me through the cross currents and queer contacts, as it were, of\nthe great bazaar (of which the Rue de Rivoli was then a much more\nbristling avenue than now) rather than depending on me for support and\nprotection, there swung into view the most splendid, as I at least\nesteemed him, of my elders and betters in the Rue Balzac, who had left\nthe questions there supposedly engaging us far behind, and, with his\nhigh hat a trifle askew and his cigar actively alight, revealed to me at\na glance what it was to be in full possession of Paris. There was speed\nin his step, assurance in his air, he was visibly, impatiently on the\nway; and he gave me thereby my first full image of what it was exactly\nto _be_ on the way. He gave it the more, doubtless, through the fact\nthat, with a flourish of the aforesaid high hat (from which the\nEnglishman of that age was so singularly inseparable) he testified to\nthe act of recognition, and to deference to my companion, but with a\ngrand big-boy good-humour that--as I remember from childhood the so\nfrequent effect of an easy patronage, compared with a top-most\noverlooking, on the part of an admired senior--only gave an accent to\nthe difference. As if he cared, or could have, that I but went forth\nthrough the Paris night in the hand of my mamma; while he had greeted us\nwith a grace that was as a beat of the very wings of freedom! Of such\nshreds, at any rate, proves to be woven the stuff of young\nsensibility--when memory (if sensibility has at all existed for it)\nrummages over our old trunkful of spiritual duds and, drawing forth ever\nso tenderly this, that and the other tattered web, holds up the pattern\nto the light. I find myself in this connection so restlessly and\ntenderly rummage that the tatters, however thin, come out in handsful\nand every shred seems tangled with another.\n\nGertrude Pendleton's mere name, for instance, becomes, and very\npreferably, the frame of another and a better picture, drawing to it\ncognate associations, those of that element of the New York cousinship\nwhich had originally operated to place there in a shining and even, as\nit were, an economic light a \"preference for Paris\"--which preference,\nduring the period of the Rue d'Angoul\u00c3\u00aame and the Rue Montaigne, we\nwistfully saw at play, the very lightest and freest, on the part of the\ninimitable Masons. Their earlier days of Tours and Trouville were over;\na period of relative rigour at the Florence of the still encircling\nwalls, the still so existent abuses and felicities, was also, I seem to\ngather, a thing of the past; great accessions, consciously awaited\nduring the previous leaner time, had beautifully befallen them, and my\nown whole consciousness of the general air--so insistently I\ndiscriminate for that alone--was coloured by a familiar view of their\nenjoyment of these on a tremendously draped and festooned _premier_ of\nthe Rue-St.-Honor\u00c3\u00a9, bristling with ormolu and Pradier statuettes and\nlooking almost straight across to the British Embassy; rather a low\npremier, after the manner of an entresol, as I remember it, and where\nthe closed windows, which but scantly distinguished between our own\nsounds and those of the sociable, and yet the terrible, street of\nrecords and memories, seemed to maintain an air and a light thick with a\nmixture of every sort of queer old Parisian amenity and reference: as if\nto look or to listen or to touch were somehow at the same time to probe,\nto recover and communicate, to behold, to taste and even to smell--to\none's greater assault by suggestion, no doubt, but also to the effect of\nsome sweet and strange repletion, as from the continued consumption,\nsay, out of flounced and puckered boxes, of serried rows of chocolate\nand other bonbons. I must have felt the whole thing as something for\none's developed senses to live up to and make light of, and have been\nrather ashamed of my own for just a little sickishly staggering under\nit. This goes, however, with the fondest recall of our cousins' inbred\nease, from far back, in all such assumable relations; and of how, four\nof the simplest, sweetest, best-natured girls as they were (with the\neldest, a charming beauty, to settle on the general ground, after\nmarriage and widowhood, and still to be blooming there), they were\npossessed of the scene and its great reaches and resources and\npossibilities in a degree that reduced us to small provincialism and a\nhanging on their lips when they told us, that is when the gentlest of\nmammas and the lovely daughter who was \"out\" did, of presentations at\nthe Tuileries to the then all-wonderful, the ineffable Empress: reports\ntouchingly qualified, on the part of our so exposed, yet after all so\nscantily indurated relatives, by the question of whether occasions so\ngreat didn't perhaps nevertheless profane the Sundays for which they\nwere usually appointed. There was something of an implication in the air\nof those days, when young Americans were more numerously lovely than\nnow, or at least more wide-eyed, it would fairly appear, that some\naccount of the only tradition they had ever been rumoured to observe\n(that of the Lord's day) might have been taken even at the Tuileries.\n\nBut what most comes back to me as the very note and fragrance of the New\nYork cousinship in this general connection is a time that I remember to\nhave glanced at on a page distinct from these, when the particular\ncousins I now speak of had conceived, under the influence of I know not\nwhat unextinguished morning star, the liveliest taste for the earliest\npossible rambles and researches, in which they were so good as to allow\nme, when I was otherwise allowed, to participate: health-giving walks,\nof an extraordinarily _matinal_ character, at the hour of the meticulous\nrag-pickers and exceptionally French polishers known to the Paris dawns\nof the Second Empire as at no time since; which made us all feel\ntogether, under the conduct of Honorine, bright child of the pavement\nherself, as if _we_, in our fresh curiosity and admiration, had also\nsomething to say to the great show presently to be opened, and were\nfree, throughout the place, as those are free of a house who know its\naspects of attic and cellar or how it looks from behind. I call our\nshepherdess Honorine even though perhaps not infallibly naming the\nsociable soubrette who might, with all her gay bold confidence, have\nbeen an official inspectress in person, and to whose easy care or, more\nparticularly, expert sensibility and candour of sympathy and curiosity,\nour flock was freely confided. If she wasn't Honorine she was Cl\u00c3\u00a9mentine\nor Augustine--which is a trifle; since what I thus recover, in any case,\nof these brushings of the strange Parisian dew, is those communities of\ncontemplation that made us most hang about the jewellers' windows in the\nPalais Royal and the public playbills of the theatres on the Boulevard.\nThe Palais Royal, now so dishonoured and disavowed, was then the very\nParis of Paris; the shutters of the shops seemed taken down, at that\nhour, for our especial benefit, and I remember well how, the \"dressing\"\nof so large a number of the compact and richly condensed fronts being\nmore often than not a matter of diamonds and pearls, rubies and\nsapphires, that represented, in their ingenuities of combination and\ncontortion, the highest taste of the time, I found open to me any amount\nof superior study of the fact that the spell of gems seemed for the\nfeminine nature almost alarmingly boundless. I stared too, it comes back\nto me, at these exhibitions, and perhaps even thought it became a young\nman of the world to express as to this or that object a refined and\nintelligent preference; but what I really most had before me was the\nchorus of abjection, as I might well have called it, led, at the highest\npitch, by Honorine and vaguely suggesting to me, by the crudity, so to\nsay, of its wistfulness, a natural frankness of passion--goodness knew\nin fact (for my small intelligence really didn't) what depths of\ncorruptibility. Droll enough, as I win them again, these queer dim plays\nof consciousness: my sense that my innocent companions, Honorine _en\nt\u00c3\u00aate_, would have done anything or everything for the richest ruby, and\nthat though one couldn't one's self be decently dead to that richness\none didn't at all know what \"anything\" might be or in the least what\n\"everything\" was. The gushing cousins, at the same time, assuredly knew\nstill less of that, and Honorine's brave gloss of a whole range alike of\npossibilities and actualities was in itself a true social grace.\n\nThey all enjoyed, in fine, while I somehow but wastefully mused--which\nwas after all my form of enjoyment; I was shy for it, though it was a\ntruth and perhaps odd enough withal, that I didn't really at all care\nfor gems, that rubies and pearls, in no matter what collocations, left\nme comparatively cold; that I actually cared for them about as little\nas, monstrously, secretly, painfully, I cared for flowers. Later on I\nwas to become aware that I \"adored\" trees and architectural\nmarbles--that for a sufficient slab of a sufficiently rare, sufficiently\nbestreaked or empurpled marble in particular I would have given a bag of\nrubies; but by then the time had passed for my being troubled to make\nout what in that case would represent on a small boy's part the\ncorruptibility, so to call it, proclaimed, before the _vitrines_, by the\ncousins. That hadn't, as a question, later on, its actuality; but it had\nso much at the time that if it had been frankly put to me I must have\nquite confessed my inability to say--and must, I gather, by the same\nstroke, have been ashamed of such inward penury; feeling that as a boy I\nshowed more poorly than girls. There was a difference meanwhile for such\npuzzlements before the porticos of the theatres; all questions melted\nfor me there into the single depth of envy--envy of the equal, the\nbeatific command of the evening hour, in the _r\u00c3\u00a9gime_ of Honorine's\nyoung train, who were fresh for the early sparrow and the chiffonier\neven after shedding buckets of tears the night before, and not so much\nas for the first or the second time, over the beautiful story of La Dame\naux Cam\u00c3\u00a9lias. There indeed was another humiliation, but by my weakness\nof position much more than of nature: whatever doing of \"everything\"\nmight have been revealed to me as a means to the end, I would certainly\nhave done it for a sight of Madame Doche and Fechter in Dumas's\ntriumphant idyll--now enjoying the fullest honours of innocuous\nclassicism; with which, as with the merits of its interpreters,\nHonorine's happy charges had become perfectly and if not quite serenely,\nat least ever so responsively and feelingly, familiar. Of a wondrous\nmixed sweetness and sharpness and queerness of uneffaced reminiscence is\nall that aspect of the cousins and the rambles and the overlapping\nnights melting along the odorously bedamped and retouched streets and\narcades; bright in the ineffable morning light, above all, of our\npeculiar young culture and candour!\n\nAll of which again has too easily led me to drop for a moment my more\nleading clue of that radiation of goodnature from Gertrude Pendleton and\nher headlong hospitalities in which we perhaps most complacently basked.\nThe becraped passage at Meurice's alluded to a little back was of a\nlater season, and the radiation, as I recall it, had been, that first\nwinter, mainly from a _petit h\u00c3\u00b4tel_ somewhere \"on the other side,\" as\nwe used with a large sketchiness to say, of the Champs Elys\u00c3\u00a9es; a region\nat that time reduced to no regularity, but figuring to my fond fancy as\na chaos of accidents and contrasts where _petits h\u00c3\u00b4tels_ of archaic type\nwere elbowed by woodyards and cabarets, and pavilions ever so\ncharacteristic, yet ever so indefinable, snuggled between frank\nindustries and vulgarities--all brightened these indeed by the sociable\nnote of Paris, be it only that of chaffering or of other _bavardise_.\nThe great consistencies of arch-refinement, now of so large a harmony,\nwere still to come, so that it seemed rather original to live there; in\nspite of which the attraction of the hazard of it on the part of our\nthen so uniformly natural young kinswoman, not so much ingeniously, or\neven expressively, as just gesticulatively and helplessly gay--since\nthat earlier pitch of New York parlance scarce arrived at, or for that\nmatter pretended to, enunciation--was quite in what I at least took to\nbe the glitter of her very conventions and traditions themselves;\nexemplified for instance by a bright nocturnal christening-party in\nhonour of the small son of all hopes whom she was so precipitately to\nlose: an occasion which, as we had, in our way, known the act of baptism\nbut as so abbreviated and in fact so tacit a business, had the effect\nfor us of one of the great \"forms\" of a society taking itself with\ntypical seriousness. We were much more serious than the Pendletons,\nbut, paradoxically enough, there was that weakness in our state of our\nbeing able to make no such attestation of it. The evening can have been\nbut of the friendliest, easiest and least pompous nature, with small\nguests, in congruity with its small hero, as well as large; but I must\nhave found myself more than ever yet in presence of a \"rite,\" one of\nthose round which as many kinds of circumstance as possible\nclustered--so that the more of these there were the more one might\nimagine a great social order observed. How shall I now pretend to say\nhow many kinds of circumstance I supposed I recognised?--with the\nremarkable one, to begin with, and which led fancy so far afield, that\nthe \"religious ceremony\" was at the same time a \"party,\" of twinkling\nlustres and disposed flowers and ladies with bare shoulders (that\nplatitudinous bareness of the period that suggested somehow the moral\nline, drawn as with a ruler and a firm pencil); with little English\ngirls, daughters of a famous physician of that nationality then pursuing\na Parisian career (he must have helped the little victim into the\nworld), and whose emphasised type much impressed itself; with round\nglazed and beribboned boxes of multi-coloured sugared almonds, drag\u00c3\u00a9es\nde bapt\u00c3\u00aame above all, which we harvested, in their heaps, as we might\nhave gathered apples from a shaken tree, and which symbolised as nothing\nelse the ritual dignity. Perhaps this grand impression really came back\nbut to the drag\u00c3\u00a9es de bapt\u00c3\u00aame, not strictly more immemorial to our young\nappreciation than the New Year's cake and the \"Election\" cake known to\nus in New York, yet immensely more official and of the nature of\nscattered largesse; partly through the days and days, as it seemed to\nme, that our life was to be furnished, reinforced and almost encumbered\nwith them. It wasn't simply that they were so toothsome, but that they\nwere somehow so important and so historic.\n\nIt was with no such frippery, however, that I connected the occasional\npresence among us of the young member of the cousinship (in this case of\nthe maternal) who most moved me to wistfulness of wonder, though not at\nall, with his then marked difference of age, by inviting my free\napproach. Vernon King, to whom I have in another part of this record\nalluded, at that time doing his baccalaur\u00c3\u00a9at on the other side of the\nSeine and coming over to our world at scraps of moments (for I recall my\nawe of the tremendous nature, as I supposed it, of his toil), as to\nquite a make-believe and gingerbread place, the lightest of substitutes\nfor the \"Europe\" in which he had been from the first so technically\nplunged. His mother and sister, also on an earlier page referred to,\nhad, from their distance, committed him to the great city to be\n\"finished,\" educationally, to the point that for our strenuous cousin\nCharlotte was the only proper one--and I feel sure he can have acquitted\nhimself in this particular in a manner that would have passed for\nbrilliant if such lights didn't, thanks to her stiff little standards,\nalways tend to burn low in her presence. These ladies were to develop\nmore and more the practice of living in odd places for abstract inhuman\nreasons--at Marseilles, at D\u00c3\u00bcsseldorf (if I rightly recall their\nprincipal German sojourn), at Naples, above all, for a long stage;\nwhere, in particular, their grounds of residence were somehow not as\nthose of others, even though I recollect, from a much later time,\nattending them there at the opera, an experience which, in their\nfashion, they succeeded in despoiling for me of every element of the\nconcrete, or at least of the pleasantly vulgar. Later impressions, few\nbut firm, were so to enhance one's tenderness for Vernon's own image,\nthe most interesting surely in all the troop of our young kinsmen early\nbaffled and gathered, that he glances at me out of the Paris period,\nfresh-coloured, just blond-bearded, always smiling and catching his\nbreath a little as from a mixture of eagerness and shyness, with such an\nappeal to the right idealisation, or to belated justice, as makes of\nmere evocation a sort of exercise of loyalty. It seemed quite richly\nlaid upon me at the time--I get it all back--that he, two or three years\nolder than my elder brother and dipped more early, as well as held more\nfirmly, in the deep, the refining waters the virtue of which we all\ntogether, though with our differences of consistency, recognised, was\nthe positive and living proof of what the process, comparatively poor\nfor ourselves, could do at its best and with clay originally and\ndomestically kneaded to the right plasticity; besides which he shone, to\nmy fancy, and all the more for its seeming so brightly and quietly in\nhis very grain, with the vague, the supposititious, but the intensely\naccent-giving stamp of the Latin quarter, which we so thinly imagined\nand so superficially brushed on our pious walks to the Luxembourg and\nthrough the parts where the glamour might have hung thickest. We were to\nsee him a little--but two or three times--three or four years later,\nwhen, just before our own return, he had come back to America for the\npurpose, if my memory serves, of entering the Harvard Law School; and to\nsee him still always with the smile that was essentially as facial, as\nlivingly and loosely fixed, somehow, as his fresh complexion itself;\nalways too with the air of caring so little for what he had been put\nthrough that, under any appeal to give out, more or less wonderfully,\nsome sample or echo of it, as who should say, he still mostly panted as\nfrom a laughing mental embarrassment: he had been put through too much;\nit was all stale to him, and he wouldn't have known where to begin. He\ndid give out, a little, on occasion--speaking, that is, on my different\nplane, as it were, and by the roundabout report of my brother; he gave\nout, it appeared, as they walked together across shining Newport sands,\nsome fragment, some beginning of a very youthful poem that \"Europe\" had,\nwith other results, moved him to, and a faint thin shred of which was to\nstick in my remembrance for reasons independent of its quality:\n\n\n     \"Harold, rememberest thou the day,\n       We rode along the Appian Way?\n     Neglected tomb and altar cast\n       Their lengthening shadow o'er the plain,\n     And while we talked the mighty past\n       Around us lived and breathed again!\"\n\n\nThat was European enough, and yet he had returned to America really to\nfind himself, even with every effort made immediately near him to defeat\nthe discovery. He found himself, with the outbreak of the War, simply as\nthe American soldier, and not under any bribe, however dim, of the\nepaulette or the girt sword; but just as the common enlisting native,\nwhich he smiled and gasped--to the increase of his happy shortness of\nbreath, as from a repletion of culture, since it suggested no lack of\npersonal soundness--at feeling himself so _like_ to be. As strange, yet\nas still more touching than strange, I recall the sight, even at a\ndistance, of the drop straight off him of all his layers of educational\nvarnish, the possession of the \"advantages,\" the tongues, the degrees,\nthe diplomas, the reminiscences, a saturation too that had all sunk\nin--a sacrifice of precious attributes that might almost have been\nviewed as a wild bonfire. So his prodigious mother, whom I have perhaps\nsufficiently presented for my reader to understand, didn't fail to view\nit--judging it also, sharply hostile to the action of the North as the\nwhole dreadful situation found her, with deep and resentful displeasure.\nI remember how I thought of Vernon himself, during the business, as at\nonce so despoiled, so diverted, and above all so resistantly bright, as\nvaguely to suggest something more in him still, some deep-down reaction,\nsome extremity of indifference and defiance, some exhibition of a young\ncharacter too long pressed and impressed, too long prescribed to and\nwith too much expected of it, and all under too firmer a will; so that\nthe public pretext had given him a lift, or lent him wings, which\nwithout its greatness might have failed him. As the case was to turn\nnothing--that is nothing he most wanted and, remarkably, most\nenjoyed--did fail him at all. I forget with which of the possible\nStates, New York, Massachusetts or Rhode Island (though I think the\nfirst) he had taken service; only seeming to remember that this all went\non for him at the start in McClellan's and later on in Grant's army,\nand that, badly wounded in a Virginia battle, he came home to be nursed\nby his mother, recently restored to America for a brief stay. She held,\nI believe, in the event, that he had, under her care, given her his vow\nthat, his term being up, he would not, should he get sufficiently well,\nre-engage. The question here was between them, but it was definite that,\nmaterially speaking, she was in no degree dependent on him. The old, the\nirrepressible adage, however, was to live again between them: when the\ndevil was sick the devil a saint would be; when the devil was well the\ndevil a saint was he!\n\nThe devil a saint, at all events, was Vernon, who denied that he had\npassed his word, and who, as soon as he had surmounted his first\ndisablement, passionately and quite admirably re-enlisted. At once\nrestored to the front and to what now gave life for him its\nindispensable relish, he was in the thick, again, of the great carnage\nroundabout Richmond, where, again gravely wounded, he (as I figure still\nincorrigibly smiling) succumbed. His mother had by this time indignantly\nreturned to Europe, accompanied by her daughter and her younger son--the\nformer of whom accepted, for our great pity, a little later on, the\noffice of closing the story. Anne King, young and frail, but not less\nfirm, under stress, than the others of her blood, came back, on her\nbrother's death, and, quietest, most colourless Electra of a lucidest\nOrestes, making her difficult way amid massed armies and battle-drenched\nfields, got possession of his buried body and bore it for reinterment to\nNewport, the old habitation, as I have mentioned, of their father's\npeople, both Vernons and Kings. It must have been to see my mother, as\nwell as to sail again for Europe, that she afterwards came to Boston,\nwhere I remember going down with her, at the last, to the dock of the\nEnglish steamer, some black and tub-like Cunarder, an archaic \"Africa\"\nor \"Asia\" sufficing to the Boston service of those days. I saw her off\ndrearily and helplessly enough, I well remember, and even at that moment\nfound for her another image: what was she most like, though in a still\nsparer and dryer form, but some low-toned, some employed little Bront\u00c3\u00ab\nheroine?--though more indeed a Lucy Snowe than a Jane Eyre, and with no\nshade of a Bront\u00c3\u00ab hero within sight. To this all the fine privilege and\nfine culture of all the fine countries (collective matter, from far\nback, of our intimated envy) had \"amounted\"; just as it had amounted for\nVernon to the bare headstone on the Newport hillside where, by his\nmother's decree, as I have already noted, there figured no hint of the\nmanner of his death. So grand, so finely personal a manner it appeared\nto me at the time, and has indeed appeared ever since, that this brief\nrecord irrepressibly springs from that. His mother, as I have equally\nnoted, was however, with her views, to find no grace in it so long as\nshe lived; and his sister went back to her, and to Marseille, as they\nalways called it, but prematurely to die.\n\n\n\n\nXXIX\n\n\nI feel that much might be made of my memories of Boulogne-sur-Mer had I\nbut here left room for the vast little subject; in which I should\nprobably, once started, wander to and fro as exploringly, as\nperceivingly, as discoveringly, I am fairly tempted to call it, as might\nreally give the measure of my small operations at the time. I was almost\nwholly reduced there to operations of that mere inward and superficially\nidle order at which we have already so freely assisted; reduced by a\ncause I shall presently mention, the production of a great blur,\nwell-nigh after the fashion of some mild domestic but quite considerably\nspreading grease-spot, in respect to the world of action, such as it\nwas, more or less immediately about me. I must personally have lived\nduring this pale predicament almost only by seeing what I could, after\nmy incorrigible ambulant fashion--a practice that may well have made me\npass for bringing home nothing in the least exhibitional--rather than by\npursuing the inquiries and interests that agitated, to whatever\nintensity, our on the whole widening little circle. The images I speak\nof as matter for more evocation that I can spare them were the fruit of\ntwo different periods at Boulogne, a shorter and a longer; this second\nappearing to us all, at the time, I gather, too endlessly and\nblightingly prolonged: so sharply, before it was over, did I at any rate\ncome to yearn for the Rue Montaigne again, the Rue Montaigne \"sublet\"\nfor a term under a flurry produced in my parents' breasts by a\n\"financial crisis\" of great violence to which the American world, as a\nmatter now of recorded history, I believe, had tragically fallen victim,\nand which had imperilled or curtailed for some months our moderate means\nof existence. We were to recover, I make out, our disturbed balance, and\nwere to pursue awhile further our chase of the alien, the somehow\nrepeatedly postponed _real_ opportunity; and the second, the\ncomparatively cramped and depressed connection with the classic refuge,\nas it then was, of spasmodic thrift, when not of settled indigence, for\nthe embarrassed of our race in the largest sense of this matter, was to\nbe shuffled off at last with no scant relief and reaction. This is\nperhaps exactly why the whole picture of our existence at the\nPas-de-Calais watering place pleads to me now for the full indulgence,\nwhat would be in other words every touch of tenderness workable, after\nall the years, over the lost and confused and above all, on their own\nside, poor ultimately rather vulgarised and violated little sources of\nimpression: items and aspects these which while they in their degree\nand after their sort flourished we only asked to admire, or at least to\nappreciate, for their rewarding extreme queerness. The very centre of my\nparticular consciousness of the place turned too soon to the fact of my\ncoming in there for the gravest illness of my life, an all but mortal\nattack of the malignant typhus of old days; which, after laying me as\nlow as I could well be laid for many weeks, condemned me to a\nconvalescence so arduous that I saw my apparently scant possibilities,\nby the measure of them then taken, even as through a glass darkly, or\nthrough the expansive blur for which I found just above a homely image.\n\nThis experience was to become when I had emerged from it the great\nreminiscence or circumstance of old Boulogne for me, and I was to regard\nit, with much intelligence, I should have maintained, as the marked\nlimit of my state of being a small boy. I took on, when I had decently,\nand all the more because I had so retardedly, recovered, the sense of\nbeing a boy of other dimensions somehow altogether, and even with a new\ndimension introduced and acquired; a dimension that I was eventually to\nthink of as a stretch in the direction of essential change or of living\nstraight into a part of myself previously quite unvisited and now made\naccessible as by the sharp forcing of a closed door. The blur of\nconsciousness imaged by my grease-spot was not, I hasten to declare,\nwithout its relenting edges and even, during its major insistence,\nfainter thicknesses; short of which, I see, my picture, the picture I\nwas always so incurably \"after,\" would have failed of animation\naltogether--quite have failed to bristle with characteristics, with\nfigures and objects and scenic facts, particular passages and moments,\nthe stuff, in short, of that scrap of minor gain which I have spoken of\nas our multiplied memories. Wasn't I even at the time, and much more\nlater on, to feel how we had been, through the thick and thin of the\nwhole adventure, assaulted as never before in so concentrated a way by\nlocal and social character? Such was the fashion after which the\nBoulogne of long ago--I have known next to nothing of it since--could\ncome forth, come more than half-way, as we say, to meet the imagination\nopen to such advances. It was, taking one thing with another, so verily\ndrenched in character that I see myself catching this fine flagrancy\nalmost equally in everything; unless indeed I may have felt it rather\nsmothered than presented on the comparatively sordid scene of the\nColl\u00c3\u00a8ge Communal, not long afterwards to expand, I believe, into the\nlocal Lyc\u00c3\u00a9e, to which the inimitable process of our education promptly\nintroduced us. I was to have less of the Coll\u00c3\u00a8ge than my elder and my\nyounger brother, thanks to the interrupting illness that placed me so\nlong, with its trail of after-effects, half complacently, half ruefully\napart; but I suffered for a few early weeks the mainly malodorous sense\nof the braver life, produced as this was by a deeply democratic\ninstitution from which no small son even of the most soapless home could\npossibly know exclusion. Odd, I recognise, that I should inhale the air\nof the place so particularly, so almost only, to that dismal effect;\nsince character was there too, for whom it should concern, and my view\nof some of the material conditions, of the general collegiate presence\ntoward the top of the steepish Grand' Rue, on the right and not much\nshort, as it comes back to me, of the then closely clustered and\ninviolate haute ville, the more or less surviving old town, the idle\ngrey rampart, the moated and towered citadel, the tree-shaded bastion\nfor strolling and sitting \"immortalised\" by Thackeray, achieved the\nmonumental, in its degree, after a fashion never yet associated for us\nwith the pursuit of learning. Didn't the Campaigner, suffering indigence\nat the misapplied hands of Colonel Newcome, rage at that hushed victim\nsupremely and dreadfully just thereabouts--by which I mean in the _haute\nville_--over some question of a sacrificed sweetbread or a cold hacked\njoint that somebody had been \"at\"? Beside such builded approaches to an\neducation as we had elsewhere known the Coll\u00c3\u00a8ge exhibited, with whatever\nreserves, the measure of style which almost any French accident of the\nadministratively architectural order more easily rises to than fails\nof; even if the matter be but a question of the shyest similitude of a\n_cour d'honneur_, the court disconnecting the scene, by intention at\nleast, from the basely bourgeois and giving value to the whole effect of\nopposed and windowed wall and important, or balanced and \"placed,\"\n_perron_. These are many words for the dull precinct, as then presented,\nI admit, and they are perhaps half prompted by a special association,\ntoo ghostly now quite to catch again--the sense of certain Sundays,\ndistinct from the grim, that is the flatly instructional, body of the\nweek, when I seem to myself to have successfully flouted the whole\nconstituted field by passing across it and from it to some quite ideally\nold-world little annexed _mus\u00c3\u00a9e de province_, as inviolate in its way as\nthe grey rampart and bare citadel, and very like them in unrelieved\ntone, where I repeatedly, and without another presence to hinder, looked\nabout me at goodness knows what weird ancientries of stale academic art.\nNot one of these treasures, in its habit as it lived, do I recall; yet\nthe sense and the \"note\" of them was at the time, none the less, not so\nelusive that I didn't somehow draw straight from them intimations of the\ninteresting, that is revelations of the \u00c3\u00a6sthetic, the historic, the\ncritical mystery and charm of things (of such things taken altogether),\nthat added to my small loose handful of the seed of culture.\n\nThat apprehension was, in its way, of our house of learning too, and\nyet I recall how, on the scant and simple terms I have glanced at, I\nquite revelled in it; whereas other impressions of my brief ordeal\nshrink, for anything in the nature of interest, but to three or four\nrecovered marks of the social composition of the school. There were the\nsons of all the small shop-keepers and not less, by my remembrance, of\ncertain of the mechanics and artisans; but there was also the English\ncontingent, these predominantly _internes_ and uniformed, blue-jacketed\nand brass-buttoned, even to an effect of odd redundancy, who by my\nconceit gave our association a lift. Vivid still to me is the summer\nmorning on which, in the wide court--as wide, that is, as I liked to\nsuppose it, and where we hung about helplessly enough for recreation--a\nbrownish black-eyed youth, of about my own degree of youthfulness,\nmentioned to me with an air that comes back as that of the liveliest\ninformational resource the outbreak, just heard of, of an awful Mutiny\nin India, where his military parents, who had not so long before sent\nhim over thence, with such weakness of imagination, as I measured it, to\nthe poor spot on which we stood, were in mortal danger of their lives;\nso that news of their having been killed would perhaps be already on the\nway. They might well have been military, these impressively exposed\ncharacters, since my friend's name was Napier, or Nappi\u00c3\u00a9 as he was\ncalled at the school, and since, I may add also, there attached to him,\nin my eyes, the glamour of an altogether new emphasis of type. The\nEnglish boys within our ken since our coming abroad had been of the\nfewest--the Fezandi\u00c3\u00a9 youths, whether English or American, besides being\nbut scantly boys, had been so lost, on that scene, in our heap of\ndisparities; and it pressed upon me after a fashion of its own that\nthose we had known in New York, and all aware of their varieties and\n\"personalities\" as one had supposed one's self, had in no case\nchallenged the restless \"placing\" impulse with any such force as the\nfinished little Nappi\u00c3\u00a9. They had not been, as he was by the very\nperversity of his finish, resultants of forces at all--or comparatively\nspeaking; it was as if their producing elements had been simple and few,\nwhereas behind this more mixed and, as we have learnt to say, evolved\ncompanion (his very simplicities, his gaps of possibility, being still\nevolved), there massed itself I couldn't have said what protective\nsocial order, what tangled creative complexity. Why I should have\nthought him almost Indian of stamp and hue because his English parents\nwere of the so general Indian peril is more than I can say; yet I have\nhis exotic and above all his bold, his imaginably even \"bad,\" young\nface, finely unacquainted with law, before me at this hour quite\nundimmed--announcing, as I conceived it, and quite as a shock, any\nawful adventure one would, as well as something that I must even at the\ntime have vaguely taken as the play of the \"passions.\" He vanishes, and\nI dare say I but make him over, as I make everything; and he must have\nled his life, whatever it was to become, with the least possible waiting\non the hour or the major consequence and no waste of energy at all in\nmooning, no patience with any substitute for his very own humour. We had\nanother schoolmate, this one native to the soil, whose references were\nwith the last vividness local and who was yet to escape with brilliancy\nin the aftertime the smallest shadow of effacement. His most direct\nreference at that season was to the principal pastry-cook's of the town,\nan establishment we then found supreme for little criss-crossed apple\ntartlets and melting _babas_--young Coquelin's home life amid which we\nthe more acutely envied that the upward cock of his so all-important\nnose testified, for my fancy, to the largest range of free familiar\nsniffing. C.-B. Coquelin is personally most present to me, in the form\nof that hour, by the value, as we were to learn to put it, of this nose,\nthe fine assurance and impudence of which fairly made it a trumpet for\npromises; yet in spite of that, the very gage, as it were, of his long\ncareer as the most interesting and many-sided comedian, or at least most\nunsurpassed dramatic _diseur_ of his time, I failed to doubt that, with\nthe rich recesses of the parental industry for his background, his\nsubtlest identity was in his privilege, or perhaps even in his expertest\ntrick, of helping himself well.\n\nThese images, however, were but drops in the bucket of my sense of\ncatching character, roundabout us, as I say, at every turn and in every\naspect; character that began even, as I was pleased to think, in our own\nhabitation, the most spacious and pompous Europe had yet treated us to,\nin spite of its fronting on the Rue Neuve Chauss\u00c3\u00a9e, a street of lively\nshopping, by the measure of that innocent age, and with its own\nground-floor occupied by a bristling exhibition of indescribably futile\n_articles de Paris_. Modern and commodious itself, it looked from its\nbalcony at serried and mismatched and quaintly-named haunts of old\nprovincial, of sedately passive rather than confidently eager, traffic;\nbut this made, among us, for much harmless inquisitory life--while we\nwere fairly assaulted, at home, by the scale and some of the striking\nnotes of our fine modernity. The young, the agreeable (agreeable to\nanything), the apparently opulent M. Prosper Sauvage--wasn't it?--had\nnot long before, unless I mistake, inherited the place as a monument of\n\"family,\" quite modestly local yet propitious family, ambition; with an\nample extension in the rear, and across the clearest prettiest court,\nfor his own dwelling, which thus became elegant, _entre cour et\njardin_, and showed all the happy symmetries and proper conventions.\nHere flourished, or rather, I surmise at this time of day, here\nlanguished, a domestic drama of which we enjoyed the murmurous overflow:\nfrankly astounding to me, I confess, how I remain still in sensitive\npresence of our resigned proprietor's domestic drama, in and out of\nwhich I see a pair of figures quite up to the dramatic mark flit again\nwith their air of the very rightest finish. I must but note these\nthings, none the less, and pass; for scarce another item of the whole\nBoulogne concert of salient images failed, after all, of a significance\neither still more strangely social or more distinctively spectacular.\nThese appearances indeed melt together for my interest, I once more\nfeel, as, during the interminable stretch of the prescribed and for the\nmost part solitary airings and outings involved in my slow convalescence\nfrom the extremity of fever, I approached that straitened and somewhat\nbedarkened issue of the Rue de l'\u00c3\u0089cu (was it?) toward the\nbright-coloured, strongly-peopled Port just where Merridew's English\nLibrary, solace of my vacuous hours and temple, in its degree too, of\ndeep initiations, mounted guard at the right. Here, frankly,\ndiscrimination drops--every particular in the impression once so quick\nand fresh sits interlinked with every other in the large lap of the\nwhole. The motley, sunny, breezy, bustling Port, with its classic, its\nadmirable fisher-folk of both sexes, models of type and tone and of what\nmight be handsomest in the thoroughly weathered condition, would have\nseemed the straightest appeal to curiosity had not the old Thackerayan\nside, as I may comprehensively call it, and the scattered wealth of\nillustration of _his_ sharpest satiric range, not so constantly\ninterposed and competed with it. The scene bristled, as I look back at\nit, with images from Men's Wives, from the society of Mr. Deuceace and\nthat of fifty other figures of the same creation, with Bareacreses and\nRawdon Crawleys and of course with Mrs. Macks, with Roseys of a more or\nless crumpled freshness and blighted bloom, with battered and bent,\nthough doubtless never quite so fine, Colonel Newcomes not less; with\nmore reminders in short than I can now gather in. Of those forms of the\nseedy, the subtly sinister, the vainly \"genteel,\" the generally damaged\nand desperate, and in particular perhaps the invincibly impudent, all\nthe marks, I feel sure, were stronger and straighter than such as we\nmeet in generally like cases under our present levelling light. Such\nanointed and whiskered and eked-out, such brazen, bluffing, swaggering\ngentlemen, such floridly repaired ladies, their mates, all looking as\nhard as they could as if they were there for mere harmless amusement--it\nwas as good, among them, as just _being_ Arthur Pendennis to know so\nwell, or at least to guess so fearfully, who and what they might be.\nThey were floated on the tide of the manners then prevailing, I judge,\nwith a rich processional effect that so many of our own grand lapses,\nwhen not of our mere final flatnesses, leave no material for; so that\nthe living note of Boulogne was really, on a more sustained view, the\nopposition between a native race the most happily tempered, the most\nbecomingly seasoned and salted and self-dependent, and a shifting\ncolony--so far as the persons composing it _could_ either urgently or\nspeculatively shift--inimitably at odds with any active freshness. And\nthe stale and the light, even though so scantly rebounding, the too\ndensely socialised, group was the English, and the \"positive\" and hardy\nand steady and wind-washed the French; and it was all as flushed with\ncolour and patched with costume and referable to record and picture, to\nliterature and history, as a more easily amusing and less earnestly\nuniform age could make it. When I speak of this opposition indeed I see\nit again most take effect in an antithesis that, on one side and the\nother, swallowed all differences at a gulp. The general British show, as\nwe had it there, in the artless mid-Victorian desert, had, I think, for\nits most sweeping sign the high assurance of its dowdiness; whereas one\nhad only to glance about at the sea-faring and fisher-folk who were the\nreal strength of the place to feel them shed at every step and by their\nevery instinct of appearance the perfect lesson of taste. There it was\nto be learnt and taken home--with never a moral, none the less, drawn\nfrom it by the \"higher types.\" I speak of course in particular of the\ntanned and trussed and kerchiefed, the active and productive women, all\nso short-skirted and free-limbed under stress; for as by the rule of the\ndowdy their sex is ever the finer example, so where the sense of the\nsuitable, of the charmingly and harmoniously right prevails, they\npreserve the pitch even as a treasure committed to their piety. To hit\nthat happy mean of rightness amid the mixed occupations of a home-mother\nand a fishwife, to be in especial both so bravely stripped below and so\nperfectly enveloped above as the deep-wading, far-striding,\nshrimp-netting, crab-gathering matrons or maidens who played,\nwaist-high, with the tides and racily quickened the market, was to make\ngrace thoroughly practical and discretion thoroughly vivid. These\nattributes had with them all, for the eye, however, a range too great\nfor me to follow, since, as their professional undress was a turn-out\npositively self-consistent, so their household, or more responsibly\npublic, or altogether festal, array played through the varied essentials\nof fluted coif and folded kerchief and sober skirt and tense, dark,\ndisplayed stocking and clicking wooden slipper, to say nothing of long\ngold ear-drop or solid short-hung pectoral cross, with a respect for\nthe rigour of conventions that had the beauty of self-respect.\n\nI owe to no season of the general period such a preserved sense of\ninnumerable unaccompanied walks--at the reason of which luxury of\nfreedom I have glanced; which as often as not were through the steep and\nlow-browed and brightly-daubed _ruelles_ of the fishing-town and either\nacross and along the level sea-marge and sustained cliff beyond; this\nlatter the site of the first Napoleon's so tremendously mustered camp of\ninvasion, with a monument as futile, by my remembrance, as that\nenterprise itself had proved, to give it all the special accent I could\nask for. Or I was as free for the _haute ville_ and the ramparts and the\nscattered, battered benches of reverie--if I may so honour my use of\nthem; they kept me not less complacently in touch with those of the so\nanciently odd and mainly contracted houses over which the stiff citadel\nand the ghost of Catherine de M\u00c3\u00a9dicis, who had dismally sojourned in it,\nstruck me as throwing such a chill, and one of which precisely must have\nwitnessed the never-to-be-forgotten Campaigner's passage in respect to\nher cold beef. Far from extinct for me is my small question of those\nhours, doubtless so mentally, so shamelessly wanton, as to what human\nlife might be tucked away in such retreats, which expressed the last\nacceptance whether of desired or of imposed quiet; so absolutely\nappointed and obliged did I feel to make out, so far as I could, what,\nin so significant a world, they on their part _represented_. I think the\nforce mainly sustaining me at that rather dreary time--as I see it can\nonly show for--was this lively felt need that everything should\nrepresent something more than what immediately and all too blankly met\nthe eye; I seem to myself to have carried it about everywhere and,\nthough of course only without outward signs that might have betrayed my\nfatuity, and insistently, quite yearningly applied it. What I wanted, in\nmy presumption, was that the object, the place, the person, the\nunreduced impression, often doubtless so difficult or so impossible to\nreduce, should give out to me something of a situation; living as I did\nin confused and confusing situations and thus hooking them on, however\nawkwardly, to almost any at all living surface I chanced to meet. My\nmemory of Boulogne is that we had almost no society of any sort at\nhome--there appearing to be about us but one sort, and that of far too\ngreat, or too fearful, an immediate bravery. Yet there were occasional\nfigures that I recover from our scant circle and that I associate,\nwhatever links I may miss, with the small still houses on the rampart;\nfigures of the quaintest, quite perhaps the frowsiest, little English\nladies in such mushroom hats, such extremely circular and bestriped\nscarlet petticoats, such perpetual tight gauntlets, such explicit\nclaims to long descent, which showed them for everything that everyone\nelse at Boulogne was not. These mid-Victorian samples of a perfect\nconsistency \"represented,\" by my measure, as hard as ever they\ncould--and represented, of all things, literature and history and\nsociety. The literature was that of the three-volume novel, then, and\nfor much after, enjoying its loosest and serenest spread; for they\nseparately and anxiously and awfully \"wrote\"--and that must almost by\nitself have amounted in them to all the history I evoked.\n\nThe dreary months, as I am content that in their second phase especially\nthey should be called, are subject, I repeat, to the perversion, quite\nperhaps to the obscuration, of my temporarily hindered health--which\nshould keep me from being too sure of these small _proportions_ of\nexperience--I was to look back afterwards as over so grey a desert;\nthrough which, none the less, there flush as sharp little certainties,\nnot to be disallowed, such matters as the general romance of Merridew,\nthe English Librarian, before mentioned, at the mouth of the Port; a\nconnection that thrusts itself upon me now as after all the truest\ncentre of my perceptions--waylaying my steps at the time, as I came and\nwent, more than any other object or impression. The question of what\n_that_ spot represented, or could be encouraged, could be aided and\nabetted, to represent, may well have supremely engaged me--for depth\nwithin depth there could only open before me. The place \"meant,\" on\nthese terms, to begin with, frank and licensed fiction, licensed to my\nrecordedly relaxed state; and what this particular luxury represented it\nmight have taken me even more time than I had to give to make out. The\nblest novel in three volumes exercised through its form, to my sense, on\ngrounds lying deeper for me to-day than my deepest sounding, an appeal\nthat fairly made it do with me what it would. Possibly a drivelling\nconfession, and the more drivelling perhaps the more development I\nshould attempt for it; from which, however, the very difficulty of the\ncase saves me. Too many associations, too much of the ferment of memory\nand fancy, are somehow stirred; they beset me again, they hover and\nwhirl about me while I stand, as I used to stand, within the positively\nsanctified walls of the shop (so of the _vieux temps_ now their aspect\nand fashion and worked system: by which I mean again of the frumpiest\nand civillest mid-Victorian), and surrender to the vision of the shelves\npacked with their rich individual trinities. Why should it have affected\nme so that my choice, so difficult in such a dazzle, could only be for a\ntrinity? I am unable fully to say--such a magic dwelt in the mere rich\nfact of the trio. When the novel of that age was \"bad,\" as it so\nhelplessly, so abjectly and prevailingly consented to be, the three\nvolumes still did something for it, a something that was, all strangely,\nnot an aggravation of its case. When it was \"good\" (our analysis, our\nterms of appreciation, had a simplicity that has lingered on) they made\nit copiously, opulently better; so that when, after the span of the\nyears, my relation with them became, from that of comparatively artless\nreader, and to the effect of a superior fondness and acuteness, that of\ncomplacent author, the tradition of infatuated youth still flung over\nthem its mantle: this at least till _all_ relation, by one of the very\nrudest turns of life we of the profession were to have known, broke off,\nin clumsy interfering hands and with almost no notice given, in a day,\nin an hour. Besides connecting me with the lost but unforgotten note of\nwaiting service and sympathy that quavered on the Merridew air, they\nrepresented just for intrinsic charm more than I could at any moment\nhave given a plain account of; they fell, by their ineffable history,\nevery trio I ever touched, into the category of such prized phenomena as\nmy memory, for instance, of fairly hanging about the Rue des Vieillards,\nat the season I speak of, through the apprehension that something vague\nand sweet--if I shouldn't indeed rather say something of infinite future\npoint and application--would come of it. This is a reminiscence that\nnothing would induce me to verify, as for example by any revisiting\nlight; but it was going to be good for me, good, that is, for what I was\npleased to regard as my intelligence or my imagination, in fine for my\nobscurely specific sense of things, that I _should_ so have hung about.\nThe name of the street was by itself of so gentle and intimate a\npersuasion that I must have been ashamed not to proceed, for the very\ngrace of it, to some shade of active response. And there was always a\nplace of particular arrest in the vista brief and blank, but inclusively\nblank, blank _after_ ancient, settled, more and more subsiding things,\nblank almost, in short, with all Matthew Arnold's \"ennui of the middle\nages,\" rather than, poorly and meanly and emptily, before such states,\nwhich was previously what I had most known of blankness. This determined\npause was at the window of a spare and solitary shop, a place of no\namplitude at all, but as of an inveterate cheerful confidence, where,\namong a few artists' materials, an exhibited water-colour from some\nnative and possibly then admired hand was changed but once in ever so\nlong. That was perhaps after all the pivot of my revolution--the\nquestion of whether or no I should at a given moment find the old\npicture replaced. I made this, when I had the luck, pass for an\nevent--yet an event which would _have_ to have had for its scene the\nprecious Rue des Vieillards, and pale though may be the recital of such\npleasures I lose myself in depths of kindness for my strain of\ningenuity.\n\nAll of which, and to that extent to be corrected, leaves small allowance\nfor my service to good M. Ansiot, rendered while my elder and younger\nbrothers--the younger completing our group of the ungovernessed--were\ncontinuously subject to collegial durance. Their ordeal was, I still\nblush to think, appreciably the heavier, as compared with mine, during\nour longer term of thrifty exile from Paris--the time of stress, as I\nfind I recall it, when we had turned our backs on the Rue Montaigne and\nmy privilege was so to roam on the winter and the spring afternoons.\nMild M. Ansiot, \"under\" whom I for some three hours each forenoon sat\nsole and underided--and actually by himself too--was a curiosity, a\nbenignity, a futility even, I gather; but save for a felt and remembered\nimpulse in me to open the window of our scene of study as soon as he had\ngone was in no degree an ideal. He might rise here, could I do him\njustice, as the rarest of my poor evocations; for he it was, to be\nfrank, who most literally smelt of the vieux temps--as to which I have\nnoted myself as wondering and musing as much as might be, with recovered\nscraps and glimpses and other intimations, only never yet for such a\ntriumph of that particular sense. To be still frank, he was little less\nthan a monster--for mere unresisting or unresilient mass of personal\npresence I mean; so that I fairly think of him as a form of bland\nporpoise, violently blowing in an age not his own, as by having had to\nexchange deep water for thin air. Thus he impressed me as with an\nabsolute ancientry of type, of tone, of responsible taste, above all;\nthis last I mean in literature, since it was literature we sociably\nexplored, to my at once charmed and shamed apprehension of the several\nfirm traditions, the pure proprieties, the discussabilities, in the\noddest way both so many and so few, of that field as they prevailed to\nhis pious view. I must have had hold, in this mere sovereign sample of\nthe accidentally, the quite unconsciously and unpretentiously, the all\nnegligibly or superfluously handed-down, of a rare case of the\nprovincial and academic _cuistre_; though even while I record it I see\nthe good man as too helpless and unaggressive, too smothered in his poor\nfacts of person and circumstance, of overgrown time of life alone, to\nincur with justness the harshness of classification. He rested with a\nweight I scarce even felt--such easy terms he made, without scruple, for\nboth of us--on the cheerful innocence of my barbarism; and though our\nmornings were short and subject, I think, to quite drowsy lapses and\nother honest aridities, we did scumble together, I make out, by the aid\nof the collected extracts from the truly and academically great which\nformed his sole resource and which he had, in a small portable and\npocketed library rather greasily preserved, some patch of picture of a\nsaving as distinguished from a losing classicism. The point remains for\nme that when all was said--and even with everything that might directly\nhave counted unsaid--he discharged for me such an office that I was to\nremain to this far-off hour in a state of possession of him that is the\nvery opposite of a blank: quite after the fashion again in which I had\nall along and elsewhere suffered and resisted, and yet so perversely and\nintimately appropriated, tutoring; which was with as little as ever to\nshow for my profit of his own express showings. The blank he fills out\ncrowds itself with a wealth of value, since I shouldn't without him have\nbeen able to claim, for whatever it may be worth, a tenth (at that let\nme handsomely put it), of my \"working\" sense of the vieux temps. How can\nI allow then that we hadn't planted together, with a loose felicity,\nsome of the seed of work?--even though the sprouting was so long put\noff. Everything, I have mentioned, had come at this time to be\nacceptedly, though far from braggingly, put off; and the ministrations\nof M. Ansiot really wash themselves over with the weak mixture that had\nbegun to spread for me, to immensity, during that summer day or two of\nour earlier residence when, betraying strange pains and apprehensions, I\nwas with all decision put to bed. Present to me still is the fact of my\nsharper sense, after an hour or two, of my being there in distress and,\nas happened for the moment, alone; present to me are the sounds of the\nsoft afternoon, the mild animation of the Boulogne street through the\nhalf-open windows; present to me above all the strange sense that\nsomething had begun that would make more difference to me, directly and\nindirectly, than anything had ever yet made. I might verily, on the\nspot, have seen, as in a fading of day and a change to something\nsuddenly queer, the whole large extent of it. I must thus, much\nimpressed but half scared, have wanted to appeal; to which end I\ntumbled, all too weakly, out of bed and wavered toward the bell just\nacross the room. The question of whether I really reached and rang it\nwas to remain lost afterwards in the strong sick whirl of everything\nabout me, under which I fell into a lapse of consciousness that I shall\nconveniently here treat as a considerable gap.\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of A Small Boy and Others, by Henry James\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK A SMALL BOY AND OTHERS ***\n\n***** This file should be named 26115-8.txt or 26115-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/2\/6\/1\/1\/26115\/\n\nProduced by Chuck Greif, Martin Pettit, University of\nToronto Libraries. and the Online Distributed Proofreading\nTeam at http:\/\/www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp:\/\/pglaf.org\/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\ninformation can be found at the Foundation's web site and official\npage at http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":852,"split":"train"}
