At age 12, Denry begins his career by altering his marks in a test sufficiently to earn him a scholarship to grammar school. At 16, he leaves school to work for Mr Duncalf, the town clerk and a solicitor. Duncalf is responsible for organizing an exclusive ball; Denry \"invites\" himself, then also a few others in exchange for things he will need, such as lessons from dance instructor Ruth Earp. On a bet, he audaciously asks the energetic, beautiful Countess of Chell to dance. Everyone, including Machin, is in awe of the Countess (apparently based on the real-life Duchess of Sutherland) and he thus earns himself the reputation of a \"card\" (a \"character\", someone able to set tongues wagging) \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a reputation he is determined to cement.\nLater, when Duncalf treats a disgruntled client brusquely, Denry leaves his employ after persuading the client to hire him as a rent collector. When some of the tenants fall behind, he begins loaning them money (at a highly profitable interest rate). Ruth herself is several months in arrears and tries to sneak away in the middle of the night. Denry catches her by accident, but rather than being angry, he admires her audacity and starts courting her.\nWhile on holiday at the seaside resort town of Llandudno with Ruth and her friend Nellie Cotterill, he witnesses a shipwreck and the rescue of the sailors. Noting the interest generated, he buys a lifeboat, hires some of the stranded mariners as rowers, and conducts tours of the picturesque wreck. However, Ruth's spendthrift nature becomes alarmingly apparent during the trip and they break up.\nBy the end of the summer, Denry has made a substantial profit from the sightseers, which he uses to finance his boldest venture. He starts up the Five Towns Universal Thrift Club. Members deposit money little by little; once they have accumulated half the sum they need to purchase whatever it is they want, the club allows them to buy on credit, but only from stores associated with the club. Denry makes money by getting a discount from the vendors in return for access to his large customer base. When his capital starts to run out, he arranges an \"accident\" for the Countess's coach. He drives conveniently by and gives her a lift to an urgent appointment. On the way there, he talks her into becoming the club's sponsor, ensuring easy financing. This proves to be the making of Denry's fortune.\nWith his great success, he is appointed a town councillor. He also backs a new daily newspaper (to be bought out at a profit by its established rival anxious to keep its monopoly) and tricks his obstinate mother into moving into a luxurious new house. At this point, Ruth reappears in Denry's life, now the widow of a rich older man. He considers renewing their relationship, but at the last moment, realizes that Nellie is the one for him and marries her.\nThe crowning achievement comes when Denry decides to become the youngest mayor in the history of Bursley. To sway the voters, he purchases the rights to footballer and native son Callear, the \"greatest centre forward in England\", for the failing Bursley football club.\nHis antics are regarded with affection and admiration by most others, as shown by the book's final exchange:\n\"What a card!\" said one, laughing joyously. \"He's a rare 'un, no mistake.\"\n\"Of course, this'll make him more popular than ever,\" said another. \"We've never had a man to touch him for that.\"\n\"And yet,\" demanded Councillor Barlow, \"what's he done? Has he ever done a day's work in his life? What great cause is he identified with?\"\n\"He's identified,\" said the speaker, \"with the great cause of cheering us all up.\"\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of The Card, A Story Of Adventure In The Five\nTowns, by Arnold Bennett\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

Brougham\nStreet runs down from St Luke's Square straight into the Shropshire\nUnion Canal, land consists partly of buildings known as \"potbanks\"\n(until they come to be sold by auction, when auctioneers describe them\nas \"extensive earthenware manufactories\") and partly of cottages whose\nhighest rent is four-and-six a week. In such surroundings was an\nextraordinary man born. He was the only anxiety of a widowed mother, who\ngained her livelihood and his by making up \"ladies' own materials\" in\nladies' own houses. Mrs Machin, however, had a speciality apart from her\nvocation: she could wash flannel with less shrinking than any other\nwoman in the district, and she could wash fine lace without ruining it;\nthus often she came to sew and remained to wash. A somewhat gloomy\nwoman; thin, with a tongue! But I liked her. She saved a certain amount\nof time every day by addressing her son as Denry, instead of Edward\nHenry.\n\nNot intellectual, not industrious, Denry would have maintained the\naverage dignity of labour on a potbank had he not at the age of twelve\nwon a scholarship from the Board School to the Endowed School. He owed\nhis triumph to audacity rather than learning, and to chance rather than\ndesign. On the second day of the examination he happened to arrive in\nthe examination-room ten minutes too soon for the afternoon sitting. He\nwandered about the place exercising his curiosity, and reached the\nmaster's desk. On the desk was a tabulated form with names of candidates\nand the number of marks achieved by each in each subject of the previous\nday. He had done badly in geography, and saw seven marks against his\nname, in the geographical column, out of a possible thirty. The figures\nhad been written in pencil. The pencil lay on the desk. He picked it\nup, glanced at the door and at the rows of empty desks, and a neat\n\"_2_\" in front of the _7_; then he strolled innocently forth\nand came back late. His trick ought to have been found out--the odds\nwere against him--but it was not found out. Of course it was dishonest.\nYes, but I will not agree that Denry was uncommonly vicious. Every\nschoolboy is dishonest, by the adult standard. If I knew an honest\nschoolboy I would begin to count my silver spoons as he grew up. All is\nfair between schoolboys and schoolmasters.\n\nThis dazzling feat seemed to influence not only Denry's career but also\nhis character. He gradually came to believe that he had won the\nscholarship by genuine merit, and that he was a remarkable boy and\ndestined to great ends. His new companions, whose mothers employed\nDenry's mother, also believed that he was a remarkable boy; but they did\nnot forget, in their gentlemanly way, to call him \"washer-woman.\"\nHappily Denry did not mind.\n\nHe had a thick skin, and fair hair and bright eyes and broad shoulders,\nand the jolly gaiety of his disposition developed daily. He did not\nshine at the school; he failed to fulfil the rosy promise of the\nscholarship; but he was not stupider than the majority; and his opinion\nof himself, having once risen, remained at \"set fair.\" It was\ninconceivable that he should work in clay with his hands.\n\n\nII\n\nWhen he was sixteen his mother, by operations on a yard and a half of\nBrussels point lace, put Mrs Emery under an obligation. Mrs Emery was\nthe sister of Mr Duncalf. Mr Duncalf was town Clerk of\nBursley, and a solicitor. It is well known that all bureaucracies are\nhoney-combed with intrigue. Denry Machin left school to be clerk to Mr\nDuncalf, on the condition that within a year he should be able to write\nshorthand at the rate of a hundred and fifty words a minute. In those\ndays mediocre and incorrect shorthand was not a drug on the market. He\ncomplied (more or less, and decidedly less than more) with the\ncondition. And for several years he really thought that he had nothing\nfurther to hope for. Then he met the Countess.\n\nThe Countess of Chell was born of poor but picturesque parents, and she\ncould put her finger on her great-grandfather's grandfather. Her mother\ngained her livelihood and her daughter's by allowing herself to be seen\na great deal with humbler but richer people's daughters. The Countess\nwas brought up to matrimony. She was aimed and timed to hit a given mark\nat a given moment. She succeeded. She married the Earl of Chell. She\nalso married about twenty thousand acres in England, about a fifth of\nScotland, a house in Piccadilly, seven country seats (including Sneyd),\na steam yacht, and five hundred thousand pounds' worth of shares in the\nMidland Railway. She was young and pretty. She had travelled in China\nand written a book about China. She sang at charity concerts and acted\nin private theatricals. She sketched from nature. She was one of the\ngreat hostesses of London. And she had not the slightest tendency to\nstoutness. All this did not satisfy her. She was ambitious! She wanted\nto be taken seriously. She wanted to enter into the life of the people.\nShe saw in the quarter of a million souls that constitute the Five Towns\na unique means to her end, an unrivalled toy. And she determined to be\nidentified with all that was most serious in the social progress of the\nFive Towns. Hence some fifteen thousand pounds were spent in\nrefurbishing Sneyd Hall, which lies on the edge of the Five Towns, and\nthe Earl and Countess passed four months of the year there. Hence the\nEarl, a mild, retiring man, when invited by the Town Council to be the\nornamental Mayor of Bursley, accepted the invitation. Hence the Mayor\nand Mayoress gave an immense afternoon reception to practically the\nentire roll of burgesses. And hence, a little later, the Mayoress let it\nbe known that she meant to give a municipal ball. The news of the ball\nthrilled Bursley more than anything had thrilled Bursley since the\nsigning of Magna Charta. Nevertheless, balls had been offered by\nprevious mayoresses. One can only suppose that in Bursley there remains\na peculiar respect for land, railway stock, steam yachts, and\ngreat-grandfathers' grandfathers.\n\nNow, everybody of account had been asked to the reception. But everybody\ncould not be asked to the ball, because not more than two hundred people\ncould dance in the Town Hall. There were nearly thirty-five thousand\ninhabitants in Bursley, of whom quite two thousand \"counted,\" even\nthough they did not dance.\n\n\nIII\n\nThree weeks and three days before the ball Denry Machin was seated one\nMonday alone in Mr Duncalf's private offices in Duck Square (where he\ncarried on his practice as a solicitor), when in stepped a tall and\npretty young woman, dressed very smartly but soberly in dark green. On\nthe desk in front of Denry were several wide sheets of \"abstract\" paper,\nconcealed by a copy of that morning's _Athletic News_. Before Denry\ncould even think of reversing the positions of the abstract paper and\nthe _Athletic News_ the young woman said \"Good-morning!\" in a very\nfriendly style. She had a shrill voice and an efficient smile.\n\n\"Good-morning, madam,\" said Denry.\n\n\"Mr Duncalf in?\" asked the young woman brightly.\n\n(Why should Denry have slipped off his stool? It is utterly against\netiquette for solicitors' clerks to slip off their stools while\nanswering inquiries.)\n\n\"No, madam; he's across at the Town Hall,\" said Denry.\n\nThe young lady shook her head playfully, with a faint smile.\n\n\"I've just been there,\" she said. \"They said he was here.\"\n\n\"I daresay I could find him, madam--if you would----\"\n\nShe now smiled broadly. \"Conservative Club, I suppose?\" she said, with\nan air deliciously confidential.\n\nHe, too, smiled.\n\n\"Oh, no,\" she said, after a little pause; \"just tell him I've called.\"\n\n\"Certainly, madam. Nothing I can do?\"\n\nShe was already turning away, but she turned back and scrutinised his\nface, as Denry thought, roguishly.\n\n\"You might just give him this list,\" she said, taking a paper from her\nsatchel and spreading it. She had come to the desk; their elbows\ntouched. \"He isn't to take any notice of the crossings-out in red ink--\nyou understand? Of course, I'm relying on him for the other lists, and I\nexpect all the invitations to be out on Wednesday. Good-morning.\"\n\nShe was gone. He sprang to the grimy window. Outside, in the snow, were\na brougham, twin horses, twin men in yellow, and a little crowd of\nyoungsters and oldsters. She flashed across the footpath, and vanished;\nthe door of the carriage banged, one of the twins in yellow leaped up to\nhis brother, and the whole affair dashed dangerously away. The face of\nthe leaping twin was familiar to Denry. The man had, indeed, once\ninhabited Brougham Street, being known to the street as Jock, and his\nmother had for long years been a friend of Mrs Machin's.\n\nIt was the first time Denry had seen the Countess, save at a distance.\nAssuredly she was finer even than her photographs. Entirely different\nfrom what one would have expected! So easy to talk to! (Yet what had he\nsaid to her? Nothing--and everything.)\n\nHe nodded his head and murmured, \"No mistake about that lot!\" Meaning,\npresumably, that all that one had read about the brilliance of the\naristocracy was true, and more than true.\n\n\"She's the finest woman that ever came into this town,\" he murmured.\n\nThe truth was that she surpassed his dreams of womanhood. At two o'clock\nshe had been a name to him. At five minutes past two he was in love with\nher. He felt profoundly thankful that, for a church tea-meeting that\nevening, he happened to be wearing his best clothes.\n\nIt was while looking at her list of invitations to the ball that he\nfirst conceived the fantastic scheme of attending the ball himself. Mr\nDuncalf was, fussily and deferentially, managing the machinery of the\nball for the Countess. He had prepared a little list of his own of\npeople who ought to be invited. Several aldermen had been requested to\ndo the same. There were thus about half-a-dozen lists to be combined\ninto one. Denry did the combining. Nothing was easier than to insert the\nname of E.H. Machin inconspicuously towards the centre of the list!\nNothing was easier than to lose the original lists, inadvertently, so\nthat if a question arose as to any particular name, the responsibility\nfor it could not be ascertained without inquiries too delicate to be\nmade. On Wednesday Denry received a lovely Bristol board, stating in\ncopper-plate that the Countess desired the pleasure of his company at\nthe ball; and on Thursday his name was ticked off as one who had\naccepted.\n\n\nIV\n\nHe had never been to a dance. He had no dress-suit, and no notion of\ndancing.\n\nHe was a strange, inconsequent mixture of courage and timidity. You and\nI are consistent in character; we are either one thing or the other but\nDenry Machin had no consistency.\n\nFor three days he hesitated, and then, secretly trembling, he slipped\ninto Shillitoe's, the young tailor who had recently set up, and who was\ngathering together the _jeunesse dor\u00c3\u00a9e_ of the town.\n\n\"I want a dress-suit,\" he said.\n\nShillitoe, who knew that Denry only earned eighteen shillings a week,\nreplied with only superficial politeness that a dress-suit was out of\nthe question; he had already taken more orders than he could execute\nwithout killing himself. The whole town had uprisen as one man and\ndemanded a dress-suit.\n\n\"So you're going to the ball, are you?\" said Shillitoe, trying to\ncondescend, but, in fact, slightly impressed.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Denry; \"are you?\"\n\nShillitoe started and then shook his head. \"No time for balls,\" said he.\n\n\"I can get you an invitation, if you like,\" said Denry, glancing at the\ndoor precisely as he had glanced at the door before adding 2 to 7.\n\n\"Oh!\" Shillitoe cocked his ears. He was not a native of the town, and\nhad no alderman to protect his legitimate interests.\n\nTo cut a shameful story short, in a week Denry was being tried on.\nShillitoe allowed him two years' credit.\n\nThe prospect of the ball gave an immense impetus to the study of the art\nof dancing in Bursley, and so put quite a nice sum of money info the\npocket of Miss Earp, a young mistress in that art. She was the daughter\nof a furniture dealer with a passion for the Bankruptcy Court. Miss\nEarp's evening classes were attended by Denry, but none of his money\nwent into her pocket. She was compensated by an expression of the\nCountess's desire for the pleasure of her company at the ball.\n\nThe Countess had aroused Denry's interest in women as a sex; Ruth Earp\nquickened the interest. She was plain, but she was only twenty-four, and\nvery graceful on her feet. Denry had one or two strictly private lessons\nfrom her in reversing. She said to him one evening, when he was\npractising reversing and they were entwined in the attitude prescribed\nby the latest fashion: \"Never mind me! Think about yourself. It's the\nsame in dancing as it is in life--the woman's duty is to adapt herself\nto the man.\" He did think about himself. He was thinking about himself\nin the middle of the night, and about her too. There had been something\nin her tone... her eye... At the final lesson he inquired if she would\ngive him the first waltz at the ball. She paused, then said yes.\n\n\nV\n\nOn the evening of the ball, Denry spent at least two hours in the\noperation which was necessary before he could give the Countess the\npleasure of his company. This operation took place in his minute bedroom\nat the back of the cottage in Brougham Street, and it was of a complex\nnature. Three weeks ago he had innocently thought that you had only to\norder a dress-suit and there you were! He now knew that a dress-suit is\nmerely the beginning of anxiety. Shirt! Collar! Tie! Studs! Cuff-links!\nGloves! Handkerchief! (He was very glad to learn authoritatively from\nShillitoe that handkerchiefs were no longer worn in the waistcoat\nopening, and that men who so wore them were barbarians and the truth was\nnot in them. Thus, an everyday handkerchief would do.) Boots!... Boots\nwere the rock on which he had struck. Shillitoe, in addition to being a\ntailor was a hosier, but by some flaw in the scheme of the universe\nhosiers do not sell boots. Except boots, Denry could get all he needed\non credit; boots he could not get on credit, and he could not pay cash\nfor them. Eventually he decided that his church boots must be dazzled up\nto the level of this great secular occasion. The pity was that he\nforgot--not that he was of a forgetful disposition in great matters; he\nwas simply over-excited--he forgot to dazzle them up until after he had\nfairly put his collar on and his necktie in a bow. It is imprudent to\ntouch blacking in a dress-shirt, so Denry had to undo the past and begin\nagain. This hurried him. He was not afraid of being late for the first\nwaltz with Miss Ruth Earp, but he was afraid of not being out of the\nhouse before his mother returned. Mrs Machin had been making up a lady's\nown materials all day, naturally--the day being what it was! If she had\nhad twelve hands instead of two, she might have made up the own\nmaterials of half-a-dozen ladies instead of one, and earned twenty-four\nshillings instead of four. Denry did not want his mother to see him ere\nhe departed. He had lavished an enormous amount of brains and energy to\nthe end of displaying himself in this refined and novel attire to the\ngaze of two hundred persons, and yet his secret wish was to deprive his\nmother of the beautiful spectacle.\n\nHowever, she slipped in, with her bag and her seamy fingers and her\nrather sardonic expression, at the very moment when Denry was putting on\nhis overcoat in the kitchen (there being insufficient room in the\npassage). He did what he could to hide his shirt-front (though she knew\nall about it), and failed.\n\n\"Bless us!\" she exclaimed briefly, going to the fire to warm her hands.\n\nA harmless remark. But her tone seemed to strip bare the vanity of human\ngreatness.\n\n\"I'm in a hurry,\" said Denry, importantly, as if he was going forth to\nsign a treaty involving the welfare of the nations.\n\n\"Well,\" said she, \"happen ye are, Denry. But th' kitchen table's no\nplace for boot-brushes.\"\n\nHe had one piece of luck. It froze. Therefore no anxiety about the\ncondition of boots.\n\n\nVI\n\nThe Countess was late; some trouble with a horse. Happily the Earl had\nbeen in Bursley all day, and had dressed at the Conservative Club; and\nhis lordship had ordered that the programme of dances should be begun.\nDenry learned this as soon as he emerged, effulgent, from the\ngentlemen's cloak-room into the broad red-carpeted corridor which runs\nfrom end to end of the ground-floor of the Town Hall. Many important\ntownspeople were chatting in the corridor--the innumerable Swetnam\nfamily, the Stanways, the great Etches, the Fearnses, Mrs Clayton\nVernon, the Suttons, including Beatrice Sutton. Of course everybody knew\nhim for Duncalf's shorthand clerk and the son of the flannel-washer; but\nuniversal white kid gloves constitute a democracy, and Shillitoe could\nput more style into a suit than any other tailor in the Five Towns.\n\n\"How do?\" the eldest of the Swetnam boys nodded carelessly.\n\n\"How do, Swetnam?\" said Denry, with equal carelessness.\n\nThe thing was accomplished! That greeting was like a Masonic initiation,\nand henceforward he was the peer of no matter whom. At first he had\nthought that four hundred eyes would be fastened on him, their glance\nsaying, \"This youth is wearing a dress-suit for the first time, and it\nis not paid for, either!\" But it was not so. And the reason was that the\nentire population of the Town Hall was heartily engaged in pretending\nthat never in its life had it been seen after seven o'clock of a night\napart from a dress-suit. Denry observed with joy that, while numerous\nmiddle-aged and awkward men wore red or white silk handkerchiefs in\ntheir waistcoats, such people as Charles Fearns, the Swetnams, and\nHarold Etches did not. He was, then, in the shyness of his handkerchief,\non the side of the angels.\n\nHe passed up the double staircase (decorated with white or pale frocks\nof unparalleled richness), and so into the grand hall. A scarlet\norchestra was on the platform, and many people strolled about the floor\nin attitudes of expectation. The walls were festooned with flowers. The\nthrill of being magnificent seized him, and he was drenched in a vast\ndesire to be truly magnificent himself. He dreamt of magnificence and\nboot-brushes kept sticking out of this dream like black mud out of snow.\nIn his reverie he looked about for Ruth Earp, but she was invisible.\nThen he went downstairs again, idly; gorgeously feigning that he spent\nsix evenings a week in ascending and descending monumental staircases,\nappropriately clad. He was determined to be as sublime as any one.\n\nThere was a stir in the corridor, and the sublimest consented to be\nexcited.\n\nThe Countess was announced to be imminent. Everybody was grouped round\nthe main portal, careless of temperatures. Six times was the Countess\nannounced to be imminent before she actually appeared, expanding from\nthe narrow gloom of her black carriage like a magic vision. Aldermen\nreceived her--and they did not do it with any excess of gracefulness.\nThey seemed afraid of her, as though she was recovering from influenza\nand they feared to catch it. She had precisely the same high voice, and\nprecisely the same efficient smile, as she had employed to Denry, and\nthese instruments worked marvels on aldermen; they were as melting as\nsalt on snow. The Countess disappeared upstairs in a cloud of shrill\napologies and trailing aldermen. She seemed to have greeted everybody\nexcept Denry. Somehow he was relieved that she had not drawn attention\nto him. He lingered, hesitating, and then he saw a being in a long\nyellow overcoat, with a bit of peacock's feather at the summit of a\nshiny high hat. This being held a lady's fur mantle. Their eyes met.\nDenry had to decide instantly. He decided.\n\n\"Hello, Jock!\" he said.\n\n\"Hello, Denry!\" said the other, pleased.\n\n\"What's been happening?\" Denry inquired, friendly.\n\nThen Jock told him about the antics of one of the Countess's horses.\n\nHe went upstairs again, and met Ruth Earp coming down. She was glorious\nin white. Except that nothing glittered in her hair, she looked the very\nequal of the Countess, at a little distance, plain though her features\nwere.\n\n\"What about that waltz?\" Denry began informally.\n\n\"That waltz is nearly over,\" said Ruth Earp, with chilliness. \"I suppose\nyou've been staring at her ladyship with all the other men.\"\n\n\"I'm awfully sorry,\" he said. \"I didn't know the waltz was----\"\n\n\"Well, why didn't you look at your programme?\"\n\n\"Haven't got one,\" he said na\u00c3\u00afvely.\n\nHe had omitted to take a programme. Ninny! Barbarian!\n\n\"Better get one,\" she said cuttingly, somewhat in her _r\u00c3\u00b4le_ of\ndancing mistress.\n\n\"Can't we finish the waltz?\" he suggested, crestfallen.\n\n\"No!\" she said, and continued her solitary way downwards.\n\nShe was hurt. He tried to think of something to say that was equal to\nthe situation, and equal to the style of his suit. But he could not. In\na moment he heard her, below him, greeting some male acquaintance in the\nmost effusive way.\n\nYet, if Denry had not committed a wicked crime for her, she could never\nhave come to the dance at all!\n\nHe got a programme, and with terror gripping his heart he asked sundry\nyoung and middle-aged women whom he knew by sight and by name for a\ndance. (Ruth had taught him how to ask.) Not one of them had a dance\nleft. Several looked at him as much as to say: \"You must be a goose to\nsuppose that my programme is not filled up in the twinkling of my eye!\"\n\nThen he joined a group of despisers of dancing near the main door.\nHarold Etches was there, the wealthiest manufacturer of his years\n(barely twenty-four) in the Five Towns. Also Shillitoe, cause of another\nof Denry's wicked crimes. The group was taciturn, critical, and very\ndoggish.\n\nThe group observed that the Countess was not dancing. The Earl was\ndancing (need it be said with Mrs Jos Curtenty, second wife of the\nDeputy Mayor?), but the Countess stood resolutely smiling, surrounded by\naldermen. Possibly she was getting her breath; possibly nobody had had\nthe pluck to ask her. Anyhow, she seemed to be stranded there, on a\nbeach of aldermen. Very wisely she had brought with her no members of a\nhouse-party from Sneyd Hall. Members of a house-party, at a municipal\nball, invariably operate as a bar between greatness and democracy; and\nthe Countess desired to participate in the life of the people.\n\n\"Why don't some of those johnnies ask her?\" Denry burst out. He had\nhitherto said nothing in the group, and he felt that he must be a man\nwith the rest of them.\n\n\"Well, _you_ go and do it. It's a free country,\" said Shillitoe.\n\n\"So I would, for two pins!\" said Denry.\n\nHarold Etches glanced at him, apparently resentful of his presence\nthere. Harold Etches was determined to put the extinguisher on\n_him_.\n\n\"I'll bet you a fiver you don't,\" said Etches scornfully.\n\n\"I'll take you,\" said Denry, very quickly, and very quickly walked off.\n\n\nVII\n\n\"She can't eat me. She can't eat me!\"\n\nThis was what he said to himself as he crossed the floor. People seemed\nto make a lane for him, divining his incredible intention. If he had not\nstarted at once, if his legs had not started of themselves, he would\nnever have started; and, not being in command of a fiver, he would\nafterwards have cut a preposterous figure in the group. But started he\nwas, like a piece of clockwork that could not be stopped! In the grand\ncrises of his life something not himself, something more powerful than\nhimself, jumped up in him and forced him to do things. Now for the first\ntime he seemed to understand what had occurred within him in previous\ncrises.\n\nIn a second--so it appeared--he had reached the Countess. Just behind\nher was his employer, Mr Duncalf, whom Denry had not previously noticed\nthere. Denry regretted this, for he had never mentioned to Mr Duncalf\nthat he was coming to the ball, and he feared Mr Duncalf.\n\n\"Could I have this dance with you?\" he demanded bluntly, but smiling and\nshowing his teeth.\n\nNo ceremonial title! No mention of \"pleasure\" or \"honour.\" Not a trace\nof the formula in which Ruth Earp had instructed him! He forgot all such\ntrivialities.\n\n\"I've won that fiver, Mr Harold Etches,\" he said to himself.\n\nThe mouths of aldermen inadvertently opened. Mr Duncalf blenched.\n\n\"It's nearly over, isn't it?\" said the Countess, still efficiently\nsmiling. She did not recognise Denry. In that suit he might have been a\nForeign Office attach\u00c3\u00a9.\n\n\"Oh! that doesn't matter, I'm sure,\" said Denry.\n\nShe yielded, and he took the paradisaical creature in his arms. It was\nher business that evening to be universally and inclusively polite. She\ncould not have begun with a refusal. A refusal might have dried up all\nother invitations whatsoever. Besides, she saw that the aldermen wanted\na lead. Besides, she was young, though a countess, and adored dancing.\n\nThus they waltzed together, while the flower of Bursley's chivalry gazed\nin enchantment. The Countess's fan, depending from her arm, dangled\nagainst Denry's suit in a rather confusing fashion, which withdrew his\nattention from his feet. He laid hold of it gingerly between two\nunemployed fingers. After that he managed fairly well. Once they came\nperilously near the Earl and his partner; nothing else. And then the\ndance ended, exactly when Denry had begun to savour the astounding\nspectacle of himself enclasping the Countess.\n\nThe Countess had soon perceived that he was the merest boy.\n\n\"You waltz quite nicely!\" she said, like an aunt, but with more than an\naunt's smile.\n\n\"Do I?\" he beamed. Then something compelled him to say: \"Do you know,\nit's the first time I've ever waltzed in my life, except in a lesson,\nyou know?\"\n\n\"Really!\" she murmured. \"You pick things up easily, I suppose?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" he said. \"Do you?\"\n\nEither the question or the tone sent the Countess off into carillons of\namusement. Everybody could see that Denry had made the Countess laugh\ntremendously. It was on this note that the waltz finished. She was still\nlaughing when he bowed to her (as taught by Ruth Earp). He could not\ncomprehend why she had so laughed, save on the supposition that he was\nmore humorous than he had suspected. Anyhow, he laughed too, and they\nparted laughing. He remembered that he had made a marked effect (though\nnot one of laughter) on the tailor by quickly returning the question,\n\"Are you?\" And his unpremeditated stroke with the Countess was similar.\nWhen he had got ten yards on his way towards Harold Etches and a fiver\nhe felt something in his hand. The Countess's fan was sticking between\nhis fingers. It had unhooked itself from her chain. He furtively\npocketed it.\n\n\nVIII\n\n\"Just the same as dancing with any other woman!\" He told this untruth in\nreply to a question from Shillitoe. It was the least he could do. And\nany other young man in his place would have said as much or as little.\n\n\"What was she laughing at?\" somebody asked.\n\n\"Ah!\" said Denry, judiciously, \"wouldn't you like to know?\"\n\n\"Here you are!\" said Etches, with an inattentive, plutocratic gesture\nhanding over a five-pound note. He was one of those men who never\nventure out of sight of a bank without a banknote in their pockets--\n\"Because you never know what may turn up.\"\n\nDenry accepted the note with a silent nod. In some directions he was\ngifted with astounding insight, and he could read in the faces of the\nhaughty males surrounding him that in the space of a few minutes he had\nrisen from nonentity into renown. He had become a great man. He did not\nat once realise how great, how renowned. But he saw enough in those eyes\nto cause his heart to glow, and to rouse in his brain those ambitious\ndreams which stirred him upon occasion. He left the group; he had need\nof motion, and also of that mental privacy which one may enjoy while\nstrolling about on a crowded floor in the midst of a considerable noise.\nHe noticed that the Countess was now dancing with an alderman, and that\nthe alderman, by an oversight inexcusable in an alderman, was not\nwearing gloves. It was he, Denry, who had broken the ice, so that the\nalderman might plunge into the water. He first had danced with the\nCountess, and had rendered her up to the alderman with delicious gaiety\nupon her countenance. By instinct he knew Bursley, and he knew that he\nwould be talked of. He knew that, for a time at any rate, he would\ndisplace even Jos Curtenty, that almost professional \"card\" and amuser\nof burgesses, in the popular imagination. It would not be: \"Have ye\nheard Jos's latest?\" It would be: \"Have ye heard about young Machin,\nDuncalf's clerk?\"\n\nThen he met Ruth Earp, strolling in the opposite direction with a young\ngirl, one of her pupils, of whom all he knew was that her name was\nNellie, and that this was her first ball: a childish little thing with a\nwistful face. He could not decide whether to look at Ruth or to avoid\nher glance. She settled the point by smiling at him in a manner that\ncould not be ignored.\n\n\"Are you going to make it up to me for that waltz you missed?\" said Ruth\nEarp. She pretended to be vexed and stern, but he knew that she was not.\n\"Or is your programme full?\" she added.\n\n\"I should like to,\" he said simply.\n\n\"But perhaps you don't care to dance with us poor, ordinary people, now\nyou've danced with the _Countess_!\" she said, with a certain lofty\nand bitter pride.\n\nHe perceived that his tone had lacked eagerness.\n\n\"Don't talk like that,\" he said, as if hurt.\n\n\"Well,\" she said, \"you can have the supper dance.\"\n\nHe took her programme to write on it.\n\n\"Why,\" he said, \"there's a name down here for the supper dance.\n'Herbert,' it looks like.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" she replied carelessly, \"that's nothing. Cross it out.\"\n\nSo he crossed Herbert out.\n\n\"Why don't you ask Nellie here for a dance?\" said Ruth Earp.\n\nAnd Nellie blushed. He gathered that the possible honour of dancing with\nthe supremely great man had surpassed Nellie's modest expectations.\n\n\"Can I have the next one?\" he said.\n\n\"Oh, yes!\" Nellie timidly whispered.\n\n\"It's a polka, and you aren't very good at polking, you know,\" Ruth\nwarned him. \"Still, Nellie will pull you through.\"\n\nNellie laughed, in silver. The na\u00c3\u00afve child thought that Ruth was trying\nto joke at Denry's expense. Her very manifest joy and pride in being\nseen with the unique Mr Machin, in being the next after the Countess to\ndance with him, made another mirror in which Denry could discern the\nreflection of his vast importance.\n\nAt the supper, which was worthy of the hospitable traditions of the\nChell family (though served standing-up in the police-court), he learnt\nall the gossip of the dance from Ruth Earp; amongst other things that\nmore than one young man had asked the Countess for a dance, and had been\nrefused, though Ruth Earp for her part declined to believe that aldermen\nand councillors had utterly absorbed the Countess's programme. Ruth\nhinted that the Countess was keeping a second dance open for him, Denry.\nWhen she asked him squarely if he meant to request another from the\nCountess, he said no, positively. He knew when to let well alone, a\nknowledge which is more precious than a knowledge of geography. The\nsupper was the summit of Denry's triumph. The best people spoke to him\nwithout being introduced. And lovely creatures mysteriously and\nintoxicatingly discovered that programmes which had been crammed two\nhours before were not, after all, quite full.\n\n\"Do tell us what the Countess was laughing at?\" This question was shot\nat him at least thirty times. He always said he would not tell. And one\ngirl who had danced with Mr Stanway, who had danced with the Countess,\nsaid that Mr Stanway had said that the Countess would not tell either.\nProof, here, that he was being extensively talked about!\n\nTowards the end of the festivity the rumour floated abroad that the\nCountess had lost her fan. The rumour reached Denry, who maintained a\nculpable silence. But when all was over, and the Countess was departing,\nhe rushed down after her, and, in a dramatic fashion which demonstrated\nhis genius for the effective, he caught her exactly as she was getting\ninto her carriage.\n\n\"I've just picked it up,\" he said, pushing through the crowd of\nworshippers.\n\n\"On! thank you so much!\" she said. And the Earl also thanked Denry. And\nthen the Countess, leaning from the carriage, said, with archness in her\nefficient smile: \"You do pick things up easily, don't you?\"\n\nAnd both Denry and the Countess laughed without restraint, and the\npillars of Bursley society were mystified.\n\nDenry winked at Jock as the horses pawed away. And Jock winked back.\n\nThe envied of all, Denry walked home, thinking violently. At a stroke he\nhad become possessed of more than he could earn from Duncalf in a month.\nThe faces of the Countess, of Ruth Earp, and of the timid Nellie mingled\nin exquisite hallucinations before his tired eyes. He was inexpressibly\nhappy. Trouble, however, awaited him.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nTHE WIDOW HULLINS'S HOUSE\n\n\nI\n\nThe simple fact that he first, of all the citizens of Bursley, had asked\na countess for a dance (and not been refused) made a new man of Denry\nMachin. He was not only regarded by the whole town as a fellow wonderful\nand dazzling, but he so regarded himself. He could not get over it. He\nhad always been cheerful, even to optimism. He was now in a permanent\nstate of calm, assured jollity. He would get up in the morning with song\nand dance. Bursley and the general world were no longer Bursley and the\ngeneral world; they had been mysteriously transformed into an oyster;\nand Denry felt strangely that the oyster-knife was lying about somewhere\nhandy, but just out of sight, and that presently he should spy it and\nseize it. He waited for something to happen. And not in vain.\n\nA few days after the historic revelry, Mrs Codleyn called to see Denry's\nemployer. Mr Duncalf was her solicitor. A stout, breathless, and yet\nmuscular woman of near sixty, the widow of a chemist and druggist who\nhad made money before limited companies had taken the liberty of being\npharmaceutical. The money had been largely invested in mortgage on\ncottage property; the interest on it had not been paid, and latterly Mrs\nCodleyn had been obliged to foreclose, thus becoming the owner of some\nseventy cottages. Mrs Codleyn, though they brought her in about twelve\npounds a week gross, esteemed these cottages an infliction, a bugbear,\nan affront, and a positive source of loss. Invariably she talked as\nthough she would willingly present them to anybody who cared to accept--\n\"and glad to be rid of 'em!\" Most owners of property talk thus. She\nparticularly hated paying the rates on them.\n\nNow there had recently occurred, under the direction of the Borough\nSurveyor, a revaluation of the whole town. This may not sound exciting;\nyet a revaluation is the most exciting event (save a municipal ball\ngiven by a titled mayor) that can happen in any town. If your house is\nrated at forty pounds a year, and rates are seven shillings in the\npound, and the revaluation lifts you up to forty-five pounds, it means\nthirty-five shillings a year right out of your pocket, which is the\ninterest on thirty-five pounds. And if the revaluation drops you to\nthirty-five pounds, it means thirty-five shillings _in_ your\npocket, which is a box of Havanas or a fancy waistcoat. Is not this\nexciting? And there are seven thousand houses in Bursley. Mrs Codleyn\nhoped that her rateable value would be reduced. She based the hope\nchiefly on the fact that she was a client of Mr Duncalf, the Town Clerk.\nThe Town Clerk was not the Borough Surveyor and had nothing to do with\nthe revaluation. Moreover, Mrs Codleyn persumably [Transcriber's note:\nsic] entrusted him with her affairs because she considered him an honest\nman, and an honest man could not honestly have sought to tickle the\nBorough Surveyor out of the narrow path of rectitude in order to oblige\na client. Nevertheless, Mrs Codleyn thought that because she patronised\nthe Town Clerk her rates ought to be reduced! Such is human nature in\nthe provinces! So different from human nature in London, where nobody\never dreams of offering even a match to a municipal official, lest the\nact might be construed into an insult.\n\nIt was on a Saturday morning that Mrs Codleyn called to impart to Mr\nDuncalf the dissatisfaction with which she had learned the news (printed\non a bit of bluish paper) that her rateable value, far from being\nreduced, had been slightly augmented.\n\nThe interview, as judged by the clerks through a lath-and-plaster wall\nand by means of a speaking tube, atoned by its vivacity for its lack of\nceremony. When the stairs had finished creaking under the descent of Mrs\nCodleyn's righteous fury, Mr Duncalf whistled sharply twice. Two\nwhistles meant Denry. Denry picked up his shorthand note-book and obeyed\nthe summons.\n\n\"Take this down!\" said his master, rudely and angrily.\n\nJust as though Denry had abetted Mrs Codleyn! Just as though Denry was\nnot a personage of high importance in the town, the friend of\ncountesses, and a shorthand clerk only on the surface.\n\n\"Do you hear?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"MADAM\"--hitherto it had always been \"Dear Madam,\" or \"Dear Mrs\nCodleyn\"--\"MADAM,--Of course I need hardly say that if, after our\ninterview this morning, and your extraordinary remarks, you wish to\nplace your interests in other hands, I shall be most happy to hand over\nall the papers, on payment of my costs. Yours truly ... To Mrs Codleyn.\"\n\nDenry reflected: \"Ass! Why doesn't he let her cool down?\" Also: \"He's\ngot 'hands' and 'hand' in the same sentence. Very ugly. Shows what a\ntemper he's in!\" Shorthand clerks are always like that--hypercritical.\nAlso: \"Well, I jolly well hope she does chuck him! Then I shan't have\nthose rents to collect.\" Every Monday, and often on Tuesday, too, Denry\ncollected the rents of Mrs Codleyn's cottages--an odious task for Denry.\nMr Duncalf, though not affected by its odiousness, deducted 7-1\/2 per\ncent. for the job from the rents.\n\n\"That'll do,\" said Mr Duncalf.\n\nBut as Denry was leaving the room Mr Duncalf called with formidable\nbrusqueness--\n\n\"Machin!\"\n\n\"Yes, sir?\"\n\nIn a flash Denry knew what was coming. He felt sickly that a crisis had\nsupervened with the suddenness of a tidal wave. And for one little\nsecond it seemed to him that to have danced with a countess while the\nflower of Bursley's chivalry watched in envious wonder was not, after\nall, the key to the door of success throughout life.\n\nUndoubtedly he had practised fraud in sending to himself an invitation\nto the ball. Undoubtedly he had practised fraud in sending invitations\nto his tailor and his dancing-mistress. On the day after the ball,\nbeneath his great glory, he had trembled to meet Mr Duncalf's eye, lest\nMr Duncalf should ask him: \"Machin, what were _you_ doing at the\nTown Hall last night, behaving as if you were the Shah of Persia, the\nPrince of Wales, and Henry Irving?\" But Mr Duncalf had said nothing, and\nMr Duncalf's eye had said nothing, and Denry thought that the danger was\npast.\n\nNow it surged up. \"Who invited you to the Mayor's ball?\" demanded Mr\nDuncalf like thunder.\n\nYes, there it was! And a very difficult question.\n\n\"I did, sir,\" he blundered out. Transparent veracity. He simply could\nnot think of a lie.\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"I thought you'd perhaps forgotten to put my name down on the list of\ninvitations, sir.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" This grimly. \"And I suppose you thought I'd also forgotten to put\ndown that tailor chap, Shillitoe?\"\n\nSo it was all out! Shillitoe must have been chattering. Denry remembered\nthat the classic established tailor of the town, Hatterton, whose trade\nShillitoe was getting, was a particular friend of Mr Duncalf's. He saw\nthe whole thing.\n\n\"Well?\" persisted Mr Duncalf, after a judicious silence from Denry.\n\nDenry, sheltered in the castle of his silence, was not to be tempted\nout.\n\n\"I suppose you rather fancy yourself dancing with your betters?\" growled\nMr Duncalf, menacingly.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Denry. \"Do _you_?\"\n\nHe had not meant to say it. The question slipped out of his mouth. He\nhad recently formed the habit of retorting swiftly upon people who put\nqueries to him: \"Yes, are _you_?\" or \"No, do _you_?\" The trick\nof speech had been enormously effective with Shillitoe, for instance,\nand with the Countess. He was in process of acquiring renown for it.\nCertainly it was effective now. Mr Duncalf's dance with the Countess had\ncome to an ignominious conclusion in the middle, Mr Duncalf preferring\nto dance on skirts rather than on the floor, and the fact was notorious.\n\n\"You can take a week's notice,\" said Mr Duncalf, pompously.\n\nIt was no argument. But employers are so unscrupulous in an altercation.\n\n\"Oh, very well,\" said Denry; and to himself he said: \"Something\n_must_ turn up, now.\"\n\nHe felt dizzy at being thus thrown upon the world--he who had been\nmeditating the propriety of getting himself elected to the stylish and\nnewly-established Sports Club at Hillport! He felt enraged, for Mr\nDuncalf had only been venting on Denry the annoyance induced in him by\nMrs Codleyn. But it is remarkable that he was not depressed at all. No!\nhe went about with songs and whistling, though he had no prospects\nexcept starvation or living on his mother. He traversed the streets in\nhis grand, new manner, and his thoughts ran: \"What on earth can I do to\nlive up to my reputation?\" However, he possessed intact the five-pound\nnote won from Harold Etches in the matter of the dance.\n\n\nII\n\nEvery life is a series of coincidences. Nothing happens that is not\nrooted in coincidence. All great changes find their cause in\ncoincidence. Therefore I shall not mince the fact that the next change\nin Denry's career was due to an enormous and complicated coincidence. On\nthe following morning both Mrs Codleyn and Denry were late for service\nat St Luke's Church--Mrs Codleyn by accident and obesity, Denry by\ndesign. Denry was later than Mrs Codleyn, whom he discovered waiting in\nthe porch. That Mrs Codleyn was waiting is an essential part of the\ncoincidence. Now Mrs Codleyn would not have been waiting if her pew had\nnot been right at the front of the church, near the choir. Nor would she\nhave been waiting if she had been a thin woman and not given to\nbreathing loudly after a hurried walk. She waited partly to get her\nbreath, and partly so that she might take advantage of a hymn or a psalm\nto gain her seat without attracting attention. If she had not been late,\nif she had not been stout, if she had not had a seat under the pulpit,\nif she had not had an objection to making herself conspicuous, she would\nhave been already in the church and Denry would not have had a private\ncolloquy with her.\n\n\"Well, you're nice people, I must say!\" she observed, as he raised his\nhat.\n\nShe meant Duncalf and all Duncalf's myrmidons. She was still full of her\ngrievance. The letter which she had received that morning had startled\nher. And even the shadow of the sacred edifice did not prevent her from\nreferring to an affair that was more suited to Monday than to Sunday\nmorning. A little more, and she would have snorted.\n\n\"Nothing to do with me, you know!\" Denry defended himself.\n\n\"Oh!\" she said, \"you're all alike, and I'll tell you this, Mr Machin,\nI'd take him at his word if it wasn't that I don't know who else\nI could trust to collect my rents. I've heard such tales about\nrent-collectors.... I reckon I shall have to make my peace with him.\"\n\n\"Why,\" said Denry, \"I'll keep on collecting your rents for you if you\nlike.\"\n\n\"You?\"\n\n\"I've given him notice to leave,\" said Denry. \"The fact is, Mr Duncalf\nand I don't hit it off together.\"\n\nAnother procrastinator arrived in the porch, and, by a singular\nsimultaneous impulse, Mrs Codleyn and Denry fell into the silence of the\noverheard and wandered forth together among the graves.\n\nThere, among the graves, she eyed him. He was a clerk at eighteen\nshillings a week, and he looked it. His mother was a sempstress, and he\nlooked it. The idea of neat but shabby Denry and the mighty Duncalf not\nhitting it off together seemed excessively comic. If only Denry could\nhave worn his dress-suit at church! It vexed him exceedingly that he had\nonly worn that expensive dress-suit once, and saw no faintest hope of\never being able to wear it again.\n\n\"And what's more,\" Denry pursued, \"I'll collect 'em for five per cent,\ninstead of seven-and-a-half. Give me a free hand, and see if I don't get\nbetter results than _he_ did. And I'll settle accounts every month,\nor week if you like, instead of once a quarter, like _he_ does.\"\n\nThe bright and beautiful idea had smitten Denry like some heavenly\narrow. It went through him and pierced Mrs Codleyn with equal success.\nIt was an idea that appealed to the reason, to the pocket, and to the\ninstinct of revenge. Having revengefully settled the hash of Mr Duncalf,\nthey went into church.\n\nNo need to continue this part of the narrative. Even the text of the\nrector's sermon has no bearing on the issue.\n\nIn a week there was a painted board affixed to the door of Denry's\nmother:\n\nE.H. MACHIN, _Rent Collector and Estate Agent_.\n\nThere was also an advertisement in the _Signal_, announcing that\nDenry managed estates large or small.\n\n\nIII\n\nThe next crucial event in Denry's career happened one Monday morning, in\na cottage that was very much smaller even than his mother's. This\ncottage, part of Mrs Codleyn's multitudinous property, stood by itself\nin Chapel Alley, behind the Wesleyan chapel; the majority of the\ntenements were in Carpenter's Square, near to. The neighbourhood was not\ndistinguished for its social splendour, but existence in it was\npicturesque, varied, exciting, full of accidents, as existence is apt to\nbe in residences that cost their occupiers an average of three shillings\na week. Some persons referred to the quarter as a slum, and ironically\ninsisted on its adjacency to the Wesleyan chapel, as though that was the\nWesleyan chapel's fault. Such people did not understand life and the joy\nthereof.\n\nThe solitary cottage had a front yard, about as large as a blanket,\nsurrounded by an insecure brick wall and paved with mud. You went up two\nsteps, pushed at a door, and instantly found yourself in the principal\nreception-room, which no earthly blanket could possibly have covered.\nBehind this chamber could be seen obscurely an apartment so tiny that an\nauctioneer would have been justified in terming it \"bijou,\" Furnished\nsimply but practically with a slopstone; also the beginnings of a\nstairway. The furniture of the reception-room comprised two chairs and a\ntable, one or two saucepans, and some antique crockery. What lay at the\nupper end of the stairway no living person knew, save the old woman who\nslept there. The old woman sat at the fireplace, \"all bunched up,\" as\nthey say in the Five Towns. The only fire in the room, however, was in\nthe short clay pipe which she smoked; Mrs Hullins was one of the last\nold women in Bursley to smoke a cutty; and even then the pipe was\nconsidered coarse, and cigarettes were coming into fashion--though not\nin Chapel Alley. Mrs Hullins smoked her pipe, and thought about nothing\nin particular. Occasionally some vision of the past floated through her\ndrowsy brain. She had lived in that residence for over forty years. She\nhad brought up eleven children and two husbands there. She had coddled\nthirty-five grand-children there, and given instruction to some\nhalf-dozen daughters-in-law. She had known midnights when she could\nscarcely move in that residence without disturbing somebody asleep. Now\nshe was alone in it. She never left it, except to fetch water from the\npump in the square. She had seen a lot of life, and she was tired.\n\nDenry came unceremoniously in, smiling gaily and benevolently, with his\nbright, optimistic face under his fair brown hair. He had large and good\nteeth. He was getting--not stout, but plump.\n\n\"Well, mother!\" he greeted Mrs Hullins, and sat down on the other chair.\n\nA young fellow obviously at peace with the world, a young fellow content\nwith himself for the moment. No longer a clerk; one of the employed;\nsaying \"sir\" to persons with no more fingers and toes than he had\nhimself; bound by servile agreement to be in a fixed place at fixed\nhours! An independent unit, master of his own time and his own\nmovements! In brief, a man! The truth was that he earned now in two days\na week slightly more than Mr Duncalf paid him for the labour of five and\na half days. His income, as collector of rents and manager of estates\nlarge or small, totalled about a pound a week. But, he walked forth in\nthe town, smiled, joked, spoke vaguely, and said, \"Do _you_?\" to\nsuch a tune that his income might have been guessed to be anything from\nten pounds a week to ten thousand a year. And he had four days a week in\nwhich to excogitate new methods of creating a fortune.\n\n\"I've nowt for ye,\" said the old woman, not moving.\n\n\"Come, come, now! That won't do,\" said Denry. \"Have a pinch of my\ntobacco.\"\n\nShe accepted a pinch of his tobacco, and refilled her pipe, and he gave\nher a match.\n\n\"I'm not going out of this house without half-a-crown at any rate!\" said\nDenry, blithely.\n\nAnd he rolled himself a cigarette, possibly to keep warm. It was very\nchilly in the stuffy residence, but the old woman never shivered. She\nwas one of those old women who seem to wear all the skirts of all their\nlives, one over the other.\n\n\"Ye're here for th' better part o' some time, then,\" observed Mrs\nHullins, looking facts in the face. \"I've told you about my son Jack.\nHe's been playing [out of work] six weeks. He starts to-day, and he'll\ngi'me summat Saturday.\"\n\n\"That won't do,\" said Denry, curtly and kindly.\n\nHe then, with his bluff benevolence, explained to Mother Hullins that\nMrs Codleyn would stand no further increase of arrears from anybody,\nthat she could not afford to stand any further increase of arrears, that\nher tenants were ruining her, and that he himself, with all his cheery\ngood-will for the rent-paying classes, would be involved in her fall.\n\n\"Six-and-forty years have I been i' this 'ere house!\" said Mrs Hullins.\n\n\"Yes, I know,\" said Denry. \"And look at what you owe, mother!\"\n\nIt was with immense good-humoured kindliness that he invited her\nattention to what she owed. She tacitly declined to look at it.\n\n\"Your children ought to keep you,\" said Denry, upon her silence.\n\n\"Them as is dead, can't,\" said Mrs Hullins, \"and them as is alive has\ntheir own to keep, except Jack.\"\n\n\"Well, then, it's bailiffs,\" said Denry, but still cheerfully.\n\n\"Nay, nay! Ye'll none turn me out.\"\n\nDenry threw up his hands, as if to exclaim: \"I've done all I can, and\nI've given you a pinch of tobacco. Besides, you oughtn't to be here\nalone. You ought to be with one of your children.\"\n\nThere was more conversation, which ended in Denry's repeating, with\nsympathetic resignation:\n\n\"No, you'll have to get out. It's bailiffs.\"\n\nImmediately afterwards he left the residence with a bright filial smile.\nAnd then, in two minutes, he popped his cheerful head in at the door\nagain.\n\n\"Look here, mother,\" he said, \"I'll lend you half-a-crown if you like.\"\n\nCharity beamed on his face, and genuinely warmed his heart.\n\n\"But you must pay me something for the accommodation,\" he added. \"I\ncan't do it for nothing. You must pay me back next week and give me\nthreepence. That's fair. I couldn't bear to see you turned out of your\nhouse. Now get your rent-book.\"\n\nAnd he marked half-a-crown as paid in her greasy, dirty rent-book, and\nthe same in his large book.\n\n\"Eh, you're a queer 'un, Mester Machin!\" murmured the old woman as he\nleft. He never knew precisely what she meant. Fifteen--twenty--years\nlater in his career her intonation of that phrase would recur to him and\npuzzle him.\n\nOn the following Monday everybody in Chapel Alley and Carpenter's Square\nseemed to know that the inconvenience of bailiffs and eviction could be\navoided by arrangement with Denry the philanthropist. He did quite a\nbusiness. And having regard to the fantastic nature of the security, he\ncould not well charge less than threepence a week for half-a-crown. That\nwas about 40 per cent. a month and 500 per cent. per annum. The security\nwas merely fantastic, but nevertheless he had his remedy against\nevil-doers. He would take what they paid him for rent and refuse to mark\nit as rent, appropriating it to his loans, so that the fear of bailiffs\nwas upon them again. Thus, as the good genius of Chapel Alley and\nCarpenter's Square, saving the distressed from the rigours of the open\nstreet, rescuing the needy from their tightest corners, keeping many a\nhome together when but for him it would have fallen to pieces--always\nsmiling, jolly, sympathetic, and picturesque--Denry at length employed\nthe five-pound note won from Harold Etches. A five-pound note--\nespecially a new and crisp one, as this was--is a miraculous fragment of\nmatter, wonderful in the pleasure which the sight of it gives, even to\nmillionaires; but perhaps no five-pound note was ever so miraculous as\nDenry's. Ten per cent. per week, compound interest, mounts up; it\nascends, and it lifts. Denry never talked precisely. But the town soon\nbegan to comprehend that he was a rising man, a man to watch. The town\nadmitted that, so far, he had lived up to his reputation as a dancer\nwith countesses. The town felt that there was something indefinable\nabout Denry.\n\nDenry himself felt this. He did not consider himself clever or\nbrilliant. But he considered himself peculiarly gifted. He considered\nhimself different from other men. His thoughts would run:\n\n\"Anybody but me would have knuckled down to Duncalf and remained a\nshorthand clerk for ever.\"\n\n\"Who but me would have had the idea of going to the ball and asking the\nCountess to dance?... And then that business with the fan!\"\n\n\"Who but me would have had the idea of taking his rent-collecting off\nDuncalf?\"\n\n\"Who but me would have had the idea of combining these loans with the\nrent-collecting? It's simple enough! It's just what they want! And yet\nnobody ever thought of it till I thought of it!\"\n\nAnd he knew of a surety that he was that most admired type in the\nbustling, industrial provinces--a card.\n\n\nIV\n\nThe desire to become a member of the Sports Club revived in his breast.\nAnd yet, celebrity though he was, rising though he was, he secretly\nregarded the Sports Club at Hillport as being really a bit above him.\nThe Sports Club was the latest and greatest phenomenon of social life in\nBursley, and it was emphatically the club to which it behoved the golden\nyouth of the town to belong. To Denry's generation the Conservative Club\nand the Liberal Club did not seem like real clubs; they were machinery\nfor politics, and membership carried nearly no distinction with it. But\nthe Sports Club had been founded by the most dashing young men of\nHillport, which is the most aristocratic suburb of Bursley and set on a\nlofty eminence. The sons of the wealthiest earthenware manufacturers\nmade a point of belonging to it, and, after a period of disdain, their\nfathers also made a point of belonging to it. It was housed in an old\nmansion, with extensive grounds and a pond and tennis courts; it had a\nworking agreement with the Golf Club and with the Hillport Cricket Club.\nBut chiefly it was a social affair. The correctest thing was to be seen\nthere at nights, rather late than early; and an exact knowledge of card\ngames and billiards was worth more in it than prowess on the field.\n\nIt was a club in the Pall Mall sense of the word.\n\nAnd Denry still lived in insignificant Brougham Street, and his mother\nwas still a sempstress! These were apparently insurmountable truths. All\nthe men whom he knew to be members were somehow more dashing than Denry\n--and it was a question of dash; few things are more mysterious than\ndash. Denry was unique, knew himself to be unique; he had danced with a\ncountess, and yet... these other fellows!... Yes, there are puzzles,\nbaffling puzzles, in the social career.\n\nIn going over on Tuesdays to Hanbridge, where he had a few trifling\nrents to collect, Denry often encountered Harold Etches in the tramcar.\nAt that time Etches lived at Hillport, and the principal Etches\nmanufactory was at Hanbridge. Etches partook of the riches of his\nfamily, and, though a bachelor, was reputed to have the spending of at\nleast a thousand a year. He was famous, on summer Sundays, on the pier\nat Llandudno, in white flannels. He had been one of the originators of\nthe Sports Club. He spent far more on clothes alone than Denry spent in\nthe entire enterprise of keeping his soul in his body. At their first\nmeeting little was said. They were not equals, and nothing but\ndress-suits could make them equals. However, even a king could not\nrefuse speech with a scullion whom he had allowed to win money from him.\n\nAnd Etches and Denry chatted feebly. Bit by bit they chatted less\nfeebly. And once, when they were almost alone on the car, they chatted\nwith vehemence during the complete journey of twenty minutes.\n\n\"He isn't so bad,\" said Denry to himself, of the dashing Harold Etches.\n\nAnd he took a private oath that at his very next encounter with Etches\nhe would mention the Sports Club--\"just to see.\" This oath disturbed his\nsleep for several night. But with Denry an oath was sacred. Having sworn\nthat he would mention the club to Etches, he was bound to mention it.\nWhen Tuesday came, he hoped that Etches would not be on the tram, and\nthe coward in him would have walked to Hanbridge instead of taking the\ntram. But he was brave. And he boarded the tram, and Etches was already\nin it. Now that he looked at it close, the enterprise of suggesting to\nHarold Etches that he, Denry, would be a suitable member of the Sports\nClub at Hillport, seemed in the highest degree preposterous. Why! He\ncould not play any games at all! He was a figure only in the streets!\nNevertheless--the oath!\n\nHe sat awkwardly silent for a few moments, wondering how to begin. And\nthen Harold Etches leaned across the tram to him and said:\n\n\"I say, Machin, I've several times meant to ask you. Why don't you put\nup for the Sports Club? It's really very good, you know.\"\n\nDenry blushed, quite probably for the last time in his life. And he saw\nwith fresh clearness how great he was, and how large he must loom in the\nlife of the town. He perceived that he had been too modest.\n\n\nV\n\nYou could not be elected to the Sports Club all in a minute. There were\nformalities; and that these formalities were complicated and took time\nis simply a proof that the club was correctly exclusive and worth\nbelonging to. When at length Denry received notice from the \"Secretary\nand Steward\" that he was elected to the most sparkling fellowship in the\nFive Towns, he was positively afraid to go and visit the club. He wanted\nsome old and experienced member to lead him gently into the club and\nexplain its usages and introduce him to the chief _habitu\u00c3\u00a9s_. Or\nelse he wanted to slip in unobserved while the heads of clubmen were\nturned. And then he had a distressing shock. Mrs Codleyn took it into\nher head that she must sell her cottage property. Now, Mrs Codleyn's\ncottage property was the back-bone of Denry's livelihood, and he could\nby no means be sure that a new owner would employ him as rent-collector.\nA new owner might have the absurd notion of collecting rents in person.\nVainly did Denry exhibit to Mrs Codleyn rows of figures, showing that\nher income from the property had increased under his control. Vainly did\nhe assert that from no other form of investment would she derive such a\nhandsome interest. She went so far as to consult an auctioneer. The\nauctioneer's idea of what could constitute a fair reserve price shook,\nbut did not quite overthrow her. At this crisis it was that Denry\nhappened to say to her, in his new large manner: \"Why! If I could\nafford, I'd buy the property off you myself, just to show you...!\" (He\ndid not explain, and he did not perhaps know himself, what had to be\nshown.) She answered that she wished to goodness he would! Then he said\nwildly that he _would_, in instalments! And he actually did buy the\nWidow Hullins's half-a-crown-a-week cottage for forty-five pounds, of\nwhich he paid thirty pounds in cash and arranged that the balance should\nbe deducted gradually from his weekly commission. He chose the Widow\nHullins's because it stood by itself--an odd piece, as it were, chipped\noff from the block of Mrs Codleyn's realty. The transaction quietened\nMrs Codleyn. And Denry felt secure because she could not now dispense\nwith his services without losing her security for fifteen pounds. (He\nstill thought in these small sums instead of thinking in thousands.)\n\nHe was now a property owner.\n\nEncouraged by this great and solemn fact, he went up one afternoon to\nthe club at Hillport. His entry was magnificent, superficially. No one\nsuspected that he was nervous under the ordeal. The truth is that no one\nsuspected because the place was empty. The emptiness of the hall gave\nhim pause. He saw a large framed copy of the \"Rules\" hanging under a\ndeer's head, and he read them as carefully as though he had not got a\ncopy in his pocket. Then he read the notices, as though they had been\nlatest telegrams from some dire seat of war. Then, perceiving a massive\nopen door of oak (the club-house had once been a pretty stately\nmansion), he passed through it, and saw a bar (with bottles) and a\nnumber of small tables and wicker chairs, and on one of the tables an\nexample of the _Staffordshire Signal_ displaying in vast letters\nthe fearful question:--\"Is your skin troublesome?\" Denry's skin was\ntroublesome; it crept. He crossed the hall and went into another room\nwhich was placarded \"Silence.\" And silence was. And on a table with\ncopies of _The Potter's World, The British Australasian, The Iron\nTrades Review_, and the _Golfers' Annual_, was a second copy of\nthe _Signal_, again demanding of Denry in vast letters whether his\nskin was troublesome. Evidently the reading-room.\n\nHe ascended the stairs and discovered a deserted billiard-room with two\ntables. Though he had never played at billiards, he seized a cue, but\nwhen he touched them the balls gave such a resounding click in the hush\nof the chamber that he put the cue away instantly. He noticed another\ndoor, curiously opened it, and started back at the sight of a small\nroom, and eight middle-aged men, mostly hatted, playing cards in two\ngroups. They had the air of conspirators, but they were merely some of\nthe finest solo-whist players in Bursley. (This was before bridge had\nquitted Pall Mall.) Among them was Mr Duncalf. Denry shut the door\nquickly. He felt like a wanderer in an enchanted castle who had suddenly\ncome across something that ought not to be come across. He returned to\nearth, and in the hall met a man in shirt-sleeves--the Secretary and\nSteward, a nice, homely man, who said, in the accents of ancient\nfriendship, though he had never spoken to Denry before: \"Is it Mr\nMachin? Glad to see you, Mr Machin! Come and have a drink with me, will\nyou? Give it a name.\" Saying which, the Secretary and Steward went\nbehind the bar, and Denry imbibed a little whisky and much information.\n\n\"Anyhow, I've _been!_\" he said to himself, going home.\n\n\nVI\n\nThe next night he made another visit to the club, about ten o'clock. The\nreading-room, that haunt of learning, was as empty as ever; but the bar\nwas full of men, smoke, and glasses. It was so full that Denry's arrival\nwas scarcely observed. However, the Secretary and Steward observed him,\nand soon he was chatting with a group at the bar, presided over by the\nSecretary and Steward's shirt-sleeves. He glanced around, and was\nsatisfied. It was a scene of dashing gaiety and worldliness that did not\nbelie the club's reputation. Some of the most important men in Bursley\nwere there. Charles Fearns, the solicitor, who practised at Hanbridge,\nwas arguing vivaciously in a corner. Fearns lived at Bleakridge and\nbelonged to the Bleakridge Club, and his presence at Hillport (two miles\nfrom Bleakridge) was a dramatic tribute to the prestige of Hillport's\nClub.\n\nFearns was apparently in one of his anarchistic moods. Though a\nsuccessful business man who voted right, he was pleased occasionally to\nuproot the fabric of society and rebuild it on a new plan of his own.\nTo-night he was inveighing against landlords--he who by \"conveyancing\"\nkept a wife and family, and a French governess for the family, in rather\nmore than comfort. The Fearns's French governess was one of the seven\nwonders of the Five Towns. Men enjoyed him in these moods; and as he\nraised his voice, so he enlarged the circle of his audience.\n\n\"If the by-laws of this town were worth a bilberry,\" he was saying,\n\"about a thousand so-called houses would have to come down to-morrow.\nNow there's that old woman I was talking about just now--Hullins. She's\na Catholic--and my governess is always slumming about among Catholics--\nthat's how I know. She's paid half-a-crown a week for pretty near half a\ncentury for a hovel that isn't worth eighteen-pence, and now she's going\nto be pitched into the street because she can't pay any more. And she's\nseventy if she's a day! And that's the basis of society. Nice refined\nsociety, eh?\"\n\n\"Who's the grasping owner?\" some one asked.\n\n\"Old Mrs Codleyn,\" said Fearns.\n\n\"Here, Mr Machin, they're talking about you,\" said the Secretary and\nSteward, genially. He knew that Denry collected Mrs Codleyn's rents.\n\n\"Mrs Codleyn isn't the owner,\" Denry called out across the room, almost\nbefore he was aware what he was doing. There was a smile on his face and\na glass in his hand.\n\n\"Oh!\" said Fearns. \"I thought she was. Who is?\"\n\nEverybody looked inquisitively at the renowned Machin, the new member.\n\n\"I am,\" said Denry.\n\nHe had concealed the change of ownership from the Widow Hullins. In his\nquality of owner he could not have lent her money in order that she\nmight pay it instantly back to himself.\n\n\"I beg your pardon,\" said Fearns, with polite sincerity. \"I'd no\nidea...!\" He saw that unwittingly he had come near to committing a gross\noutrage on club etiquette.\n\n\"Not at all!\" said Denry. \"But supposing the cottage was _yours_,\nwhat would _you_ do, Mr Fearns? Before I bought the property I used\nto lend her money myself to pay her rent.\"\n\n\"I know,\" Fearns answered, with a certain dryness of tone.\n\nIt occurred to Denry that the lawyer knew too much.\n\n\"Well, what should you do?\" he repeated obstinately.\n\n\"She's an old woman,\" said Fearns. \"And honest enough, you must admit.\nShe came up to see my governess, and I happened to see her.\"\n\n\"But what should you do in my place?\" Denry insisted.\n\n\"Since you ask, I should lower the rent and let her off the arrears,\"\nsaid Fearns.\n\n\"And supposing she didn't pay then? Let her have it rent-free because\nshe's seventy? Or pitch her into the street?\"\n\n\"Oh--Well--\"\n\n\"Fearns would make her a present of the blooming house and give her a\nconveyance free!\" a voice said humorously, and everybody laughed.\n\n\"Well, that's what I'll do,\" said Denry. \"If Mr Fearns will do the\nconveyance free, I'll make her a present of the blooming house. That's\nthe sort of grasping owner I am.\"\n\nThere was a startled pause. \"I mean it,\" said Denry firmly, even\nfiercely, and raised his glass. \"Here's to the Widow Hullins!\"\n\nThere was a sensation, because, incredible though the thing was, it had\nto be believed. Denry himself was not the least astounded person in the\ncrowded, smoky room. To him, it had been like somebody else talking, not\nhimself. But, as always when he did something crucial, spectacular, and\neffective, the deed had seemed to be done by a mysterious power within\nhim, over which he had no control.\n\nThis particular deed was quixotic, enormously unusual; a deed assuredly\nwithout precedent in the annals of the Five Towns. And he, Denry, had\ndone it. The cost was prodigious, ridiculously and dangerously beyond\nhis means. He could find no rational excuse for the deed. But he had\ndone it. And men again wondered. Men had wondered when he led the\nCountess out to waltz. That was nothing to this. What! A smooth-chinned\nyouth giving houses away--out of mere, mad, impulsive generosity.\n\nAnd men said, on reflection, \"Of course, that's just the sort of thing\nMachin _would_ do!\" They appeared to find a logical connection\nbetween dancing with a Countess and tossing a house or so to a poor\nwidow. And the next morning every man who had been in the Sports Club\nthat night was remarking eagerly to his friends: \"I say, have you heard\nyoung Machin's latest?\"\n\nAnd Denry, inwardly aghast at his own rashness, was saying to himself:\n\"Well, no one but me would ever have done that!\"\n\nHe was now not simply a card; he was _the_ card.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nTHE PANTECHNICON\n\n\nI\n\n\"How do you do, Miss Earp?\" said Denry, in a worldly manner, which he\nhad acquired for himself by taking the most effective features of the\nmanners of several prominent citizens, and piecing them together so\nthat, as a whole, they formed Denry's manner.\n\n\"Oh! How do you do, Mr Machin?\" said Ruth Earp, who had opened her door\nto him at the corner of Tudor Passage and St Luke's Square.\n\nIt was an afternoon in July. Denry wore a new summer suit, whose pattern\nindicated not only present prosperity but the firm belief that\nprosperity would continue. As for Ruth, that plain but piquant girl was\nin one of her simpler costumes; blue linen; no jewellery. Her hair was\nin its usual calculated disorder; its outer fleeces held the light. She\nwas now at least twenty-five, and her gaze disconcertingly combined\nextreme maturity with extreme candour. At one moment a man would be\nsaying to himself: \"This woman knows more of the secrets of human nature\nthan I can ever know.\" And the next he would be saying to himself: \"What\na simple little thing she is!\" The career of nearly every man is marked\nat the sharp corners with such women. Speaking generally, Ruth Earp's\ndemeanour was hard and challenging. It was evident that she could not be\nsubject to the common weaknesses of her sex. Denry was glad.\n\nA youth of quick intelligence, he had perceived all the dangers of the\nmission upon which he was engaged, and had planned his precautions.\n\n\"May I come in a minute?\" he asked in a purely business tone. There was\nno hint in that tone of the fact that once she had accorded him a\nsupper-dance.\n\n\"Please do,\" said Ruth.\n\nAn agreeable flouncing swish of linen skirts as she turned to precede\nhim down the passage! But he ignored it. That is to say, he easily\nsteeled himself against it.\n\nShe led him to the large room which served as her dancing academy--the\nbare-boarded place in which, a year and a half before, she had taught\nhis clumsy limbs the principles of grace and rhythm. She occupied the\nback part of a building of which the front part was an empty shop. The\nshop had been tenanted by her father, one of whose frequent bankruptcies\nhad happened there; after which his stock of the latest novelties in\ninexpensive furniture had been seized by rapacious creditors, and Mr\nEarp had migrated to Birmingham, where he was courting the Official\nReceiver anew. Ruth had remained solitary and unprotected, with a\nconsiderable amount of household goods which had been her mother's.\n(Like all professional bankrupts, Mr Earp had invariably had belongings\nwhich, as he could prove to his creditors, did not belong to him.)\nPublic opinion had justified Ruth in her enterprise of staying in\nBursley on her own responsibility and renting part of the building, in\norder not to lose her \"connection\" as a dancing-mistress. Public opinion\nsaid that \"there would have been no sense in her going dangling after\nher wastrel of a father.\"\n\n\"Quite a long time since we saw anything of each other,\" observed Ruth\nin rather a pleasant style, as she sat down and as he sat down.\n\nIt was. The intimate ecstasy of the supper-dance had never been\nrepeated. Denry's exceeding industry in carving out his career, and his\ndesire to graduate as an accomplished clubman, had prevented him from\ngiving to his heart that attention which it deserved, having regard to\nhis tender years.\n\n\"Yes, it is, isn't it?\" said Denry.\n\nThen there was a pause, and they both glanced vaguely about the\ninhospitable and very wooden room. Now was the moment for Denry to carry\nout his pre-arranged plan in all its savage simplicity. He did so.\n\"I've called about the rent, Miss Earp,\" he said, and by an effort\nlooked her in the eyes.\n\n\"The rent?\" exclaimed Ruth, as though she had never in all her life\nheard of such a thing as rent; as though June 24 (recently past) was an\nordinary day like any other day.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Denry.\n\n\"What rent?\" asked Ruth, as though for aught she guessed it might have\nbeen the rent of Buckingham Palace that he had called about.\n\n\"Yours,\" said Denry.\n\n\"Mine!\" she murmured. \"But what has my rent got to do with you?\" she\ndemanded. And it was just as if she had said, \"But what has my rent got\nto do with you, little boy?\"\n\n\"Well,\" he said, \"I suppose you know I'm a rent-collector?\"\n\n\"No, I didn't,\" she said.\n\nHe thought she was fibbing out of sheer naughtiness. But she was not.\nShe did not know that he collected rents. She knew that he was a card, a\nfigure, a celebrity; and that was all. It is strange how the knowledge\nof even the cleverest woman will confine itself to certain fields.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said, always in a cold, commercial tone, \"I collect rents.\"\n\n\"I should have thought you'd have preferred postage-stamps,\" she said,\ngazing out of the window at a kiln that was blackening all the sky.\n\nIf he could have invented something clever and cutting in response to\nthis sally he might have made the mistake of quitting his _r\u00c3\u00b4le_ of\nhard, unsentimental man of business. But he could think of nothing. So\nhe proceeded sternly:\n\n\"Mr Herbert Calvert has put all his property into my hands, and he has\ngiven me strict instructions that no rent is to be allowed to remain in\narrear.\"\n\nNo answer from Ruth. Mr Calvert was a little fellow of fifty who had\nmade money in the mysterious calling of a \"commission agent.\" By\nreputation he was really very much harder than Denry could even pretend\nto be, and indeed Denry had been considerably startled by the advent of\nsuch a client. Surely if any man in Bursley were capable of unmercifully\ncollecting rents on his own account, Herbert Calvert must be that man!\n\n\"Let me see,\" said Denry further, pulling a book from his pocket and\npeering into it, \"you owe five quarters' rent--thirty pounds.\"\n\nHe knew without the book precisely what Ruth owed, but the book kept him\nin countenance, supplied him with needed moral support.\n\nRuth Earp, without the least warning, exploded into a long peal of gay\nlaughter. Her laugh was far prettier than her face. She laughed well.\nShe might, with advantage to Bursley, have given lessons in laughing as\nwell as in dancing, for Bursley laughs without grace. Her laughter was a\nproof that she had not a care in the world, and that the world for her\nwas naught but a source of light amusement.\n\nDenry smiled guardedly.\n\n\"Of course, with me it's purely a matter of business,\" said he.\n\n\"So that's what Mr Herbert Calvert has done!\" she exclaimed, amid the\nembers of her mirth. \"I wondered what he would do! I presume you know\nall about Mr Herbert Calvert,\" she added.\n\n\"No,\" said Denry, \"I don't know anything about him, except that he owns\nsome property and I'm in charge of it. Stay,\" he corrected himself, \"I\nthink I do remember crossing his name off your programme once.\"\n\nAnd he said to himself: \"That's one for her. If she likes to be so\ndesperately funny about postage-stamps, I don't see why I shouldn't have\nmy turn.\" The recollection that it was precisely Herbert Calvert whom he\nhad supplanted in the supper-dance at the Countess of Chell's historic\nball somehow increased his confidence in his ability to manage the\ninterview with brilliance.\n\nRuth's voice grew severe and chilly. It seemed incredible that she had\njust been laughing.\n\n\"I will tell you about Mr Herbert Calvert;\" she enunciated her words\nwith slow, stern clearness. \"Mr Herbert Calvert took advantage of his\nvisits here for his rent to pay his attentions to me. At one time he was\nso far--well--gone, that he would scarcely take his rent.\"\n\n\"Really!\" murmured Denry, genuinely staggered by this symptom of the\ndistance to which Mr Herbert Calvert was once \"gone.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Ruth, still sternly and inimically. \"Naturally a woman can't\nmake up her mind about these things all of a sudden,\" she continued.\n\"Naturally!\" she repeated.\n\n\"Of course,\" Denry agreed, perceiving that his experience of life, and\ndeep knowledge of human nature were being appealed to.\n\n\"And when I did decide definitely, Mr Herbert Calvert did not behave\nlike a gentleman. He forgot what was due to himself and to me. I won't\ndescribe to you the scene he made. I'm simply telling you this, so that\nyou may know. To cut a long story short, he behaved in a very vulgar\nway. And a woman doesn't forget these things, Mr Machin.\" Her eyes\nthreatened him. \"I decided to punish Mr Herbert Calvert. I thought if he\nwouldn't take his rent before--well, let him wait for it now! I might\nhave given him notice to leave. But I didn't. I didn't see why I should\nlet myself be upset because Mr Herbert Calvert had forgotten that he was\na gentleman. I said, 'Let him wait for his rent,' and I promised myself\nI would just see what he would dare to do.\"\n\n\"I don't quite follow your argument,\" Denry put in.\n\n\"Perhaps you don't,\" she silenced him. \"I didn't expect you would. You\nand Mr Herbert Calvert...! So he didn't dare to do anything himself, and\nhe's paying you to do his dirty work for him! Very well! Very well!...\"\nShe lifted her head defiantly. \"What will happen if I don't pay the\nrent?\"\n\n\"I shall have to let things take their course,\" said Denry with a genial\nsmile.\n\n\"All right, then,\" Ruth Earp responded. \"If you choose to mix yourself\nup with people like Mr Herbert Calvert, you must take the consequences!\nIt's all the same to me, after all.\"\n\n\"Then it isn't convenient for you to pay anything on account?\" said\nDenry, more and more affable.\n\n\"Convenient!\" she cried. \"It's perfectly convenient, only I don't care\nto. I won't pay a penny until I'm forced. Let Mr Herbert Calvert do his\nworst, and then I'll pay. And not before! And the whole town shall hear\nall about Mr Herbert Calvert!\"\n\n\"I see,\" he laughed easily.\n\n\"Convenient!\" she reiterated, contemptuously. \"I think everybody in\nBursley knows how my _client\u00c3\u00a8le_ gets larger and larger every\nyear!... Convenient!\"\n\n\"So that's final, Miss Earp?\"\n\n\"Perfectly!\" said Miss Earp.\n\nHe rose. \"Then the simplest thing will be for me to send round a bailiff\nto-morrow morning, early.\" He might have been saying: \"The simplest\nthing will be for me to send round a bunch of orchids.\"\n\nAnother man would have felt emotion, and probably expressed it. But not\nDenry, the rent-collector and manager of estates large and small. There\nwere several different men in Denry, but he had the great gift of not\nmixing up two different Denrys when he found himself in a complicated\nsituation.\n\nRuth Earp rose also. She dropped her eyelids and looked at him from\nunder them. And then she gradually smiled.\n\n\"I thought I'd just see what you'd do,\" she said, in a low, confidential\nvoice from which all trace of hostility had suddenly departed. \"You're a\nstrange creature,\" she went on curiously, as though fascinated by the\nproblems presented by his individuality. \"Of course, I shan't let it go\nas far as that. I only thought I'd see what you'd say. I'll write you\nto-night.\"\n\n\"With a cheque?\" Denry demanded, with suave, jolly courtesy. \"I don't\ncollect postage-stamps.\"\n\n(And to himself: \"She's got her stamps back.\")\n\nShe hesitated. \"Stay!\" she said. \"I'll tell you what will be better. Can\nyou call to-morrow afternoon? The bank will be closed now.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" he said, \"I can call. What time?\"\n\n\"Oh!\" she answered, \"any time. If you come in about four, I'll give you\na cup of tea into the bargain. Though you don't deserve it!\" After an\ninstant, she added reassuringly: \"Of course I know business is business\nwith you. But I'm glad I've told you the real truth about your precious\nMr Herbert Calvert, all the same.\"\n\nAnd as he walked slowly home Denry pondered upon the singular, erratic,\nincalculable strangeness of woman, and of the possibly magic effect of\nhis own personality on women.\n\n\nII\n\nIt was the next afternoon, in July. Denry wore his new summer suit, but\nwith a necktie of higher rank than the previous day's. As for Ruth, that\nplain but piquant girl was in one of her more elaborate and foamier\ncostumes. The wonder was that such a costume could survive even for an\nhour the smuts that lend continual interest and excitement to the\natmosphere of Bursley. It was a white muslin, spotted with spots of\nopaque white, and founded on something pink. Denry imagined that he had\nseen parts of it before--at the ball; and he had; but it was now a\ntea-gown, with long, languishing sleeves; the waves of it broke at her\nshoulders, sending lacy surf high up the precipices of Ruth's neck.\nDenry did not know it was a tea-gown. But he knew that it had a most\npeculiar and agreeable effect on himself, and that she had promised him\ntea. He was glad that he had paid her the homage of his best necktie.\n\nAlthough the month was July, Ruth wore a kind of shawl over the\ntea-gown. It was not a shawl, Denry noted; it was merely about two yards\nof very thin muslin. He puzzled himself as to its purpose. It could not\nbe for warmth, for it would not have helped to melt an icicle. Could it\nbe meant to fulfil the same function as muslin in a confectioner's shop?\nShe was pale. Her voice was weak and had an imploring quality.\n\nShe led him, not into the inhospitable wooden academy, but into a very\nsmall room which, like herself, was dressed in muslin and bows of\nribbon. Photographs of amiable men and women decorated the pinkish-green\nwalls. The mantelpiece was concealed in drapery as though it had been a\nsin. A writing-desk as green as a leaf stood carelessly in one corner;\non the desk a vase containing some Cape gooseberries. In the middle of\nthe room a small table, on the table a spirit-lamp in full blast, and on\nthe lamp a kettle practising scales; a tray occupied the remainder of\nthe table. There were two easy chairs; Ruth sank delicately into one,\nand Denry took the other with precautions.\n\nHe was nervous. Nothing equals muslin for imparting nervousness to the\nna\u00c3\u00afve. But he felt pleased.\n\n\"Not much of the Widow Hullins touch about this!\" he reflected\nprivately.\n\nAnd he wished that all rent-collecting might be done with such ease, and\namid such surroundings, as this particular piece of rent-collecting. He\nsaw what a fine thing it was to be a free man, under orders from nobody;\nnot many men in Bursley were in a position to accept invitations to four\no'clock tea at a day's notice. Further 5 per cent. on thirty pounds was\nthirty shillings, so that if he stayed an hour--and he meant to stay an\nhour--he would, while enjoying himself, be earning money steadily at the\nrate of sixpence a minute.\n\nIt was the ideal of a business career.\n\nWhen the kettle, having finished its scales, burst into song with an\naccompaniment of castanets and vapour, and Ruth's sleeves rose and fell\nas she made the tea, Denry acknowledged frankly to himself that it was\nthis sort of thing, and not the Brougham Street sort of thing, that he\nwas really born for. He acknowledged to himself humbly that this sort of\nthing was \"life,\" and that hitherto he had had no adequate idea of what\n\"life\" was. For, with all his ability as a card and a rising man, with\nall his assiduous frequenting of the Sports Club, he had not penetrated\ninto the upper domestic strata of Bursley society. He had never been\ninvited to any house where, as he put it, he would have had to mind his\np's and q's. He still remained the kind of man whom you familiarly chat\nwith in the street and club, and no more. His mother's fame as a\nflannel-washer was against him; Brougham Street was against him; and,\nchiefly, his poverty was against him. True, he had gorgeously given a\nhouse away to an aged widow! True, he succeeded in transmitting to his\nacquaintances a vague idea that he was doing well and waxing financially\nfrom strength to strength! But the idea was too vague, too much in the\nair. And save by a suit of clothes, he never gave ocular proof that he\nhad money to waste. He could not. It was impossible for him to compete\nwith even the more modest of the bloods and the blades. To keep a\nsatisfactory straight crease down the middle of each leg of his trousers\nwas all he could accomplish with the money regularly at his disposal.\nThe town was wafting for him to do something decisive in the matter of\nwhat it called \"the stuff.\"\n\nThus Ruth Earp was the first to introduce him to the higher intimate\ncivilisations, the refinements lurking behind the foul walls of Bursley.\n\n\"Sugar?\" she questioned, her head on one side, her arm uplifted, her\nsleeve drooping, and a bit of sugar caught like a white mouse between\nthe claws of the tongs.\n\nNobody before had ever said \"Sugar?\" to him like that. His mother never\nsaid \"Sugar?\" to him. His mother was aware that he liked three pieces,\nbut she would not give him more than two. \"Sugar?\" in that slightly\nweak, imploring voice seemed to be charged with a significance at once\ntremendous and elusive.\n\n\"Yes, please.\"\n\n\"Another?\"\n\nAnd the \"Another?\" was even more delicious.\n\nHe said to himself: \"I suppose this is what they call flirting.\"\n\nWhen a chronicler tells the exact truth, there is always a danger that\nhe will not be believed. Yet, in spite of the risk, it must be said\nplainly that at this point Denry actually thought of marriage. An absurd\nand childish thought, preposterously rash; but it came into his mind,\nand--what is more--it stuck there! He pictured marriage as a perpetual\nafternoon tea alone with an elegant woman, amid an environment of\nribboned muslin. And the picture appealed to him very strongly. And Ruth\nappeared to him in a new light. It was perhaps the change in her voice\nthat did it. She appeared to him at once as a creature very feminine and\nenchanting, and as a creature who could earn her own living in a manner\nthat was both original and ladylike. A woman such as Ruth would be a\ndelight without being a drag. And, truly, was she not a remarkable\nwoman, as remarkable as he was a man? Here she was living amid the\nrefinements of luxury. Not an expensive luxury (he had an excellent\nnotion of the monetary value of things), but still luxury. And the whole\naffair was so stylish. His heart went out to the stylish.\n\nThe slices of bread-and-butter were rolled up. There, now, was a\npleasing device! It cost nothing to roll up a slice of bread-and-butter\n--her fingers had doubtless done the rolling--and yet it gave quite a\ndifferent taste to the food.\n\n\"What made you give that house to Mrs Hullins?\" she asked him suddenly,\nwith a candour that seemed to demand candour.\n\n\"Oh,\" he said, \"just a lark! I thought I would. It came to me all in a\nsecond, and I did.\"\n\nShe shook her head. \"Strange boy!\" she observed.\n\nThere was a pause.\n\n\"It was something Charlie Fearns said, wasn't it?\" she inquired.\n\nShe uttered the name \"Charlie Fearns\" with a certain faint hint of\ndisdain, as if indicating to Denry that of course she and Denry were\nquite able to put Fearns into his proper place in the scheme of things.\n\n\"Oh!\" he said. \"So you know all about it?\"\n\n\"Well,\" said she, \"naturally it was all over the town. Mrs Fearns's\ngirl, Annunciata--what a name, eh?--is one of my pupils--the youngest,\nin fact.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said he, after another pause, \"I wasn't going to have Fearns\ncoming the duke over me!\"  She smiled sympathetically. He felt that they\nunderstood each other deeply.\n\n\"You'll find some cigarettes in that box,\" she said, when he had been\nthere thirty minutes, and pointed to the mantelpiece.\n\n\"Sure you don't mind?\" he murmured.\n\nShe raised her eyebrows.\n\nThere was also a silver match-box in the larger box. No detail lacked.\nIt seemed to him that he stood on a mountain and had only to walk down a\nwinding path in order to enter the promised land. He was decidedly\npleased with the worldly way in which he had said: \"Sure you don't\nmind?\"\n\nHe puffed out smoke delicately. And, the cigarette between his lips, as\nwith his left hand he waved the match into extinction, he demanded:\n\n\"You smoke?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she said, \"but not in public. I know what you men are.\"\n\nThis was in the early, timid days of feminine smoking.\n\n\"I assure you!\" he protested, and pushed the box towards her. But she\nwould not smoke.\n\n\"It isn't that I mind _you_,\" she said, \"not at all. But I'm not\nwell. I've got a frightful headache.\"\n\nHe put on a concerned expression.\n\n\"I _thought_ you looked rather pale,\" he said awkwardly.\n\n\"Pale!\" she repeated the word. \"You should have seen me this morning: I\nhave fits of dizziness, you know, too. The doctor says it's nothing but\ndyspepsia. However, don't let's talk about poor little me and my silly\ncomplaints. Perhaps the tea will do me good.\"\n\nHe protested again, but his experience of intimate civilisation was too\nbrief to allow him to protest with effectiveness. The truth was, he\ncould not say these things naturally. He had to compose them, and then\npronounce them, and the result failed in the necessary air of\nspontaneity. He could not help thinking what marvellous self-control\nwomen had. Now, when he had a headache--which happily was seldom--he\ncould think of nothing else and talk of nothing else; the entire\nuniverse consisted solely of his headache. And here she was overcome\nwith a headache, and during more than half-an-hour had not even\nmentioned it!\n\nShe began talking gossip about the Fearnses and the Swetnams, and she\nmentioned rumours concerning Henry Mynors (who had scruples against\ndancing) and Anna Tellwright, the daughter of that rich old skinflint\nEphraim Tellwright. No mistake; she was on the inside of things in\nBursley society! It was just as if she had removed the front walls of\nevery house and examined every room at her leisure, with minute\nparticularity. But of course a teacher of dancing had opportunities....\nDenry had to pretend to be nearly as omniscient as she was.\n\nThen she broke off, without warning, and lay back in her chair.\n\n\"I wonder if you'd mind going into the barn for me?\" she murmured.\n\nShe generally referred to her academy as the barn. It had once been a\nwarehouse.\n\nHe jumped up. \"Certainly,\" he said, very eager.\n\n\"I think you'll see a small bottle of eau-de-Cologne on the top of the\npiano,\" she said, and shut her eyes.\n\nHe hastened away, full of his mission, and feeling himself to be a\nterrific cavalier and guardian of weak women. He felt keenly that he\nmust be equal to the situation. Yes, the small bottle of eau-de-Cologne\nwas on the top of the piano. He seized it and bore it to her on the\nwings of chivalry. He had not been aware that eau-de-Cologne was a\nremedy for, or a palliative of, headaches.\n\nShe opened her eyes, and with a great effort tried to be bright and\nbetter. But it was a failure. She took the stopper out of the bottle and\nsniffed first at the stopper and then at the bottle; then she spilled a\nfew drops of the liquid on her handkerchief and applied the handkerchief\nto her temples.\n\n\"It's easier,\" she said.\n\n\"Sure?\" he asked. He did not know what to do with himself--whether to\nsit down and feign that she was well, or to remain standing in an\nattitude of respectful and grave anxiety. He thought he ought to depart;\nyet would it not be ungallant to desert her under the circumstances? She\nwas alone. She had no servant, only an occasional charwoman.\n\nShe nodded with brave, false gaiety. And then she had a relapse.\n\n\"Don't you think you'd better lie down?\" he suggested in more masterful\naccents. And added; \"And I'll go....? You ought to lie down. It's the\nonly thing.\" He was now speaking to her like a wise uncle.\n\n\"Oh no!\" she said, without conviction. \"Besides, you can't go till I've\npaid you.\"\n\nIt was on the tip of his tongue to say, \"Oh! don't bother about that\nnow!\" But he restrained himself. There was a notable core of\ncommon-sense in Denry. He had been puzzling how he might neatly mention\nthe rent while departing in a hurry so that she might lie down. And now\nshe had solved the difficulty for him.\n\nShe stretched out her arm, and picked up a bunch of keys from a basket\non a little table.\n\n\"You might just unlock that desk for me, will you?\" she said. And,\nfurther, as she went through the keys one by one to select the right\nkey: \"Each quarter I've put your precious Mr Herbert Calvert's rent in a\ndrawer in that desk. ... Here's the key.\" She held up the whole ring by\nthe chosen key, and he accepted it. And she lay back once more in her\nchair, exhausted by her exertions.\n\n\"You must turn the key sharply in the lock,\" she said weakly, as he\nfumbled at the locked part of the desk.\n\nSo he turned the key sharply.\n\n\"You'll see a bag in the little drawer on the right,\" she murmured.\n\nThe key turned round and round. It had begun by resisting, but now it\nyielded too easily.\n\n\"It doesn't seem to open,\" he said, feeling clumsy.\n\nThe key clicked and slid, and the other keys rattled together.\n\n\"Oh yes,\" she replied. \"I opened it quite easily this morning. It\n_is_ a bit catchy.\"\n\nThe key kept going round and round.\n\n\"Here! I'll do it,\" she said wearily.\n\n\"Oh no!\" he urged.\n\nBut she rose courageously, and tottered to the desk, and took the bunch\nfrom him.\n\n\"I'm afraid you've broken something in the lock,\" she announced, with\ngentle resignation, after she had tried to open the desk and failed.\n\n\"Have I?\" he mumbled. He knew that he was not shining.\n\n\"Would you mind calling in at Allman's,\" she said, resuming her chair,\n\"and tell them to send a man down at once to pick the lock? There's\nnothing else for it. Or perhaps you'd better say first thing to-morrow\nmorning. And then as soon as he's done it I'll call and pay you the\nmoney myself. And you might tell your precious Mr Herbert Calvert that\nnext quarter I shall give notice to leave.\"\n\n\"Don't you trouble to call, please,\" said he. \"I can easily pop in\nhere.\"\n\nShe sped him away in an enigmatic tone. He could not be sure whether he\nhad succeeded or failed, in her estimation, as a man of the world and a\npartaker of delicate teas.\n\n\"Don't _forget_ Allman's!\" she enjoined him as he left the room. He\nwas to let himself out.\n\n\nIII\n\nHe was coming home late that night from the Sports Club, from a\ndelectable evening which had lasted till one o'clock in the morning,\nwhen just as he put the large door-key into his mother's cottage he grew\naware of peculiar phenomena at the top end of Brougham Street, where it\nruns into St Luke's Square. And then in the gas-lit gloom of the warm\nsummer night he perceived a vast and vague rectangular form in the slow\nmovement towards the slope of Brougham Street.\n\nIt was a pantechnicon van.\n\nBut the extraordinary thing was, not that it should be a pantechnicon\nvan, but that if should be moving of its own accord and power. For there\nwere no horses in front of it, and Denry saw that the double shafts had\nbeen pushed up perpendicularly, after the manner of carmen when they\noutspan. The pantechnicon was running away. It had perceived the wrath\nto come and was fleeing. Its guardians had evidently left it imperfectly\nscotched or braked, and it had got loose.\n\nIt proceeded down the first bit of Brougham Street with a dignity worthy\nof its dimensions, and at the same time with apparently a certain sense\nof the humour of the situation. Then it seemed to be saying to itself:\n\"Pantechnicons will be pantechnicons.\" Then it took on the absurd\ngravity of a man who is perfectly sure that he is not drunk.\nNevertheless it kept fairly well to the middle of the road, but as\nthough the road were a tight-rope.\n\nThe rumble of it increased as it approached Denry. He withdrew the key\nfrom his mother's cottage and put it in his pocket. He was always at his\nfinest in a crisis. And the onrush of the pantechnicon constituted a\nclear crisis. Lower down the gradient of Brougham Street was more\ndangerous, and it was within the possibilities that people inhabiting\nthe depths of the street might find themselves pitched out of bed by the\nsharp corner of a pantechnicon that was determined to be a pantechnicon.\nA pantechnicon whose ardour is fairly aroused may be capable of\nsurpassing deeds. Whole thoroughfares might crumble before it.\n\nAs the pantechnicon passed Denry, at the rate of about three and a half\nmiles an hour, he leaped, or rather he scrambled, on to it, losing\nnothing in the process except his straw hat, which remained a witness at\nhis mother's door that her boy had been that way and departed under\nunusual circumstances. Denry had the bright idea of dropping the shafts\ndown to act as a brake. But, unaccustomed to the manipulation of shafts,\nhe was rather slow in accomplishing the deed, and ere the first pair of\nshafts had fallen the pantechnicon was doing quite eight miles an hour\nand the steepest declivity was yet to come. Further, the dropping of the\nleft-hand shafts jerked the van to the left, and Denry dropped the other\npair only just in time to avoid the sudden uprooting of a lamp-post. The\nfour points of the shafts digging and prodding into the surface of the\nroad gave the pantechnicon something to think about for a few seconds.\nBut unfortunately the precipitousness of the street encouraged its\nhead-strong caprices, and a few seconds later all four shafts were\nbroken, and the pantechnicon seemed to scent the open prairie. (What it\nreally did scent was the canal.) Then Denry discovered the brake, and\nfuriously struggled with the iron handle. He turned it and turned it,\nsome forty revolutions. It seemed to have no effect. The miracle was\nthat the pantechnicon maintained its course in the middle of the street.\nPresently Denry could vaguely distinguish the wall and double wooden\ngates of the canal wharf. He could not jump off; the pantechnicon was\nnow an express, and I doubt whether he would have jumped off, even if\njumping off had not been madness. His was the kind of perseverance that,\nfor the fun of it, will perish in an attempt. The final fifty or sixty\nyards of Brougham Street were level, and the pantechnicon slightly\nabated its haste. Denry could now plainly see, in the radiance of a\ngas-lamp, the gates of the wharf, and on them the painted letters:--\n\n  SHROPSHIRE UNION CANAL COY., LTD..\n\n  GENERAL CARRIERS.\n\n  _No Admittance except on Business_\n\nHe was heading straight for those gates, and the pantechnicon evidently\nhad business within. It jolted over the iron guard of the\nweighing-machine, and this jolt deflected it, so that instead of aiming\nat the gates it aimed for part of a gate and part of a brick pillar.\nDenry ground his teeth together and clung to his seat. The gate might\nhave been paper, and the brick pillar a cardboard pillar. The\npantechnicon went through them as a sword will go through a ghost, and\nDenry was still alive. The remainder of the journey was brief and\nviolent, owing partly to a number of bags of cement, and partly to the\npropinquity of the canal basin. The pantechnicon jumped into the canal\nlike a mastodon, and drank.\n\nDenry, clinging to the woodwork, was submerged for a moment, but, by\nstanding on the narrow platform from which sprouted the splintered ends\nof the shafts, he could get his waist clear of the water. He was not a\nswimmer.\n\nAll was still and dark, save for the faint stream of starlight on the\nbroad bosom of the canal basin. The pantechnicon had encountered nobody\nwhatever _en route_. Of its strange escapade Denry had been the\nsole witness.\n\n\"Well, I'm dashed!\" he murmured aloud.\n\nAnd a voice replied from the belly of the pantechnicon:\n\n\"Who is there?\"\n\nAll Denry's body shook.\n\n\"It's me!\" said he.\n\n\"Not Mr Machin?\" said the voice.\n\n\"Yes,\" said he. \"I jumped on as it came down the street--and here we\nare!\"\n\n\"Oh!\" cried the voice. \"I do wish you could get round to me.\"\n\nRuth Earp's voice.\n\nHe saw the truth in a moment of piercing insight. Ruth had been playing\nwith him! She had performed a comedy for him in two acts. She had meant\nto do what is called in the Five Towns \"a moonlight flit.\" The\npantechnicon (doubtless from Birmingham, where her father was) had been\nbrought to her door late in the evening, and was to have been filled and\ntaken away during the night. The horses had been stabled, probably in\nRuth's own yard, and while the carmen were reposing the pantechnicon had\ngot off, Ruth in it. She had no money locked in her unlockable desk. Her\nreason for not having paid the precious Mr Herbert Calvert was not the\nreason which she had advanced.\n\nHis first staggered thought was:\n\n\"She's got a nerve! No mistake!\"\n\nHer duplicity, her wickedness, did not shock him. He admired her\ntremendous and audacious enterprise; it appealed strongly to every cell\nin his brain. He felt that she and he were kindred spirits.\n\nHe tried to clamber round the side of the van so as to get to the doors\nat the back, but a pantechnicon has a wheel-base which forbids leaping\nfrom wheel to wheel, especially, when the wheels are under water. Hence\nhe was obliged to climb on to the roof, and so slide down on to the top\nof one of the doors, which was swinging loose. The feat was not simple.\nAt last he felt the floor of the van under half a yard of water.\n\n\"Where are you?\"\n\n\"I'm here,\" said Ruth, very plaintively. \"I'm on a table. It was the\nonly thing they had put into the van before they went off to have their\nsupper or something. Furniture removers are always like that. Haven't\nyou got a match?\"\n\n\"I've got scores of matches,\" said Denry. \"But what good do you suppose\nthey'll be now, all soaked through?\"\n\nA short silence. He noticed that she had offered no explanation of her\nconduct towards himself. She seemed to take it for granted that he would\nunderstand.\n\n\"I'm frightfully bumped, and I believe my nose is bleeding,\" said Ruth,\nstill more plaintively. \"It's a good thing there was a lot of straw and\nsacks here.\"\n\nThen, after much groping, his hand touched her wet dress.\n\n\"You know you're a very naughty girl,\" he said.\n\nHe heard a sob, a wild sob. The proud, independent creature had broken\ndown under the stress of events. He climbed out of the water on to the\npart of the table which she was not occupying. And the van was as black\nas Erebus.\n\nGradually, out of the welter of sobs, came faint articulations, and\nlittle by little he learnt the entire story of her difficulties, her\nmisfortunes, her struggles, and her defeats. He listened to a frank\nconfession of guilt. But what could she do? She had meant well. But what\ncould she do? She had been driven into a corner. And she had her father\nto think of! Honestly, on the previous day, she had intended to pay the\nrent, or part of it. But there had been a disappointment! And she had\nbeen so unwell. In short...\n\nThe van gave a lurch. She clutched at him and he at her. The van was\nsettling down for a comfortable night in the mud.\n\n(Queer that it had not occurred to him before, but at the first visit\nshe had postponed paying him on the plea that the bank was closed, while\nat the second visit she had stated that the actual cash had been slowly\naccumulating in her desk! And the discrepancy had not struck him. Such\nis the influence of a teagown. However, he forgave her, in consideration\nof her immense audacity.)\n\n\"What can we do?\" she almost whispered.\n\nHer confidence in him affected him.\n\n\"Wait till it gets light,\" said he.\n\nSo they waited, amid the waste of waters. In a hot July it is not\nunpleasant to dangle one's feet in water during the sultry dark hours.\nShe told him more and more.\n\nWhen the inspiring grey preliminaries of the dawn began, Denry saw that\nat the back of the pantechnicon the waste of waters extended for at most\na yard, and that it was easy, by climbing on to the roof, to jump\ntherefrom to the wharf. He did so, and then fixed a plank so that Ruth\ncould get ashore. Relieved of their weight the table floated out after\nthem. Denry seized it, and set about smashing it to pieces with his\nfeet.\n\n\"What _are_ you doing?\" she asked faintly. She was too enfeebled to\nprotest more vigorously.\n\n\"Leave it to me,\" said Denry. \"This table is the only thing that can\ngive your show away. We can't carry it back. We might meet some one.\"\n\nHe tied the fragments of the table together with rope that was afloat in\nthe van, and attached the heavy iron bar whose function was to keep the\ndoors closed. Then he sank the faggot of wood and iron in a distant\ncorner of the basin.\n\n\"There!\" he said. \"Now you understand. Nothing's happened except that a\nfurniture van's run off and fallen into the canal owing to the men's\ncarelessness. We can settle the rest later--I mean about the rent and so\non.\"\n\nThey looked at each other.\n\nHer skirts were nearly dry. Her nose showed no trace of bleeding, but\nthere was a bluish lump over her left eye. Save that he was hatless, and\nthat his trousers clung, he was not utterly unpresentable.\n\nThey were alone in the silent dawn.\n\n\"You'd better go home by Acre Lane, not up Brougham Street,\" he said.\n\"I'll come in during the morning.\"\n\nIt was a parting in which more was felt than said.\n\nThey went one after the other through the devastated gateway, baptising\nthe path as they walked. The Town Hall clock struck three as Denry crept\nup his mother's stairs. He had seen not a soul.\n\n\nIV\n\nThe exact truth in its details was never known to more than two\ninhabitants of Bursley. The one thing clear certainly appeared to be\nthat Denry, in endeavouring to prevent a runaway pantechnicon from\ndestroying the town, had travelled with it into the canal. The romantic\ntrip was accepted as perfectly characteristic of Denry. Around this\nisland of fact washed a fabulous sea of uninformed gossip, in which\nassertion conflicted with assertion, and the names of Denry and Ruth\nwere continually bumping against each other.\n\nMr Herbert Calvert glanced queerly and perhaps sardonically at Denry\nwhen Denry called and handed over ten pounds (less commission) which he\nsaid Miss Earp had paid on account.\n\n\"Look here,\" said the little Calvert, his mean little eyes gleaming.\n\"You must get in the balance at once.\"\n\n\"That's all right,\" said Denry. \"I shall.\"\n\n\"Was she trying to hook it on the q.t.?\" Calvert demanded.\n\n\"Oh, no!\" said Denry. \"That was a very funny misunderstanding. The only\nexplanation I can think of is that that van must have come to the wrong\nhouse.\"\n\n\"Are you engaged to her?\" Calvert asked, with amazing effrontery.\n\nDenry paused. \"Yes,\" he said. \"Are you?\"\n\nMr Calvert wondered what he meant.\n\nHe admitted to himself that the courtship had begun in a manner\nsurpassingly strange.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nWRECKING OF A LIFE\n\n\nI\n\nIn the Five Towns, and perhaps elsewhere, there exists a custom in\nvirtue of which a couple who have become engaged in the early summer\nfind themselves by a most curious coincidence at the same seaside\nresort, and often in the same street thereof, during August. Thus it\nhappened to Denry and to Ruth Earp. There had been difficulties--there\nalways are. A business man who lives by collecting weekly rents\nobviously cannot go away for an indefinite period. And a young woman who\nlives alone in the world is bound to respect public opinion. However,\nRuth arranged that her girlish friend, Nellie Cotterill, who had\ngenerous parents, should accompany her. And the North Staffordshire\nRailway's philanthropic scheme of issuing four-shilling tourist return\ntickets to the seaside enabled Denry to persuade himself that he was not\nabsolutely mad in contemplating a fortnight on the shores of England.\n\nRuth chose Llandudno, Llandudno being more stylish than either Rhyl or\nBlackpool, and not dearer. Ruth and Nellie had a double room in a\nboarding-house, No. 26 St Asaph's Road (off the Marine Parade), and\nDenry had a small single room in another boarding-house, No. 28 St\nAsaph's Road. The ideal could scarcely have been approached more nearly.\n\nDenry had never seen the sea before. As, in his gayest clothes, he\nstrolled along the esplanade or on the pier between those two girls in\ntheir gayest clothes, and mingled with the immense crowd of\npleasure-seekers and money-spenders, he was undoubtedly much impressed\nby the beauty and grandeur of the sea. But what impressed him far more\nthan the beauty and grandeur of the sea was the field for profitable\ncommercial enterprise which a place like Llandudno presented. He had not\nonly his first vision of the sea, but his first genuine vision of the\npossibilities of amassing wealth by honest ingenuity. On the morning\nafter his arrival he went out for a walk and lost himself near the Great\nOrme, and had to return hurriedly along the whole length of the Parade\nabout nine o'clock. And through every ground-floor window of every house\nhe saw a long table full of people eating and drinking the same kinds of\nfood. In Llandudno fifty thousand souls desired always to perform the\nsame act at the same time; they wanted to be distracted and they would\ndo anything for the sake of distraction, and would pay for the\nprivilege. And they would all pay at once.\n\nThis great thought was more majestic to him than the sea, or the Great\nOrme, or the Little Orme.\n\nIt stuck in his head because he had suddenly grown into a very serious\nperson. He had now something to live for, something on which to lavish\nhis energy. He was happy in being affianced, and more proud than happy,\nand more startled than proud. The manner and method of his courtship had\nsharply differed from his previous conception of what such an affair\nwould be. He had not passed through the sensations which he would have\nexpected to pass through. And then this question was continually\npresenting itself: _What could she see in him?_ She must have got a\nnotion that he was far more wonderful than he really was. Could it be\ntrue that she, his superior in experience and in splendour of person,\nhad kissed him? _Him!_ He felt that it would be his duty to live up\nto this exaggerated notion which she had of him. But how?\n\n\nII\n\nThey had not yet discussed finance at all, though Denry would have liked\nto discuss it. Evidently she regarded him as a man of means. This became\nclear during the progress of the journey to Llandudno. Denry was\nflattered, but the next day he had slight misgivings, and on the\nfollowing day he was alarmed; and on the day after that his state\nresembled terror. It is truer to say that she regarded him less as a man\nof means than as a magic and inexhaustible siphon of money.\n\nHe simply could not stir out of the house without spending money, and\noften in ways quite unforeseen. Pier, minstrels, Punch and Judy,\nbathing, buns, ices, canes, fruit, chairs, row-boats, concerts, toffee,\nphotographs, char-\u00c3\u00a0-bancs: any of these expenditures was likely to\nhappen whenever they went forth for a simple stroll. One might think\nthat strolls were gratis, that the air was free! Error! If he had had\nthe courage he would have left his purse in the house as Ruth invariably\ndid. But men are moral cowards.\n\nHe had calculated thus:--Return fare, four shillings a week. Agreed\nterms at boarding-house, twenty-five shillings a week. Total expenses\nper week, twenty-nine shillings,--say thirty!\n\nOn the first day he spent fourteen shillings on nothing whatever--which\nwas at the rate of five pounds a week of supplementary estimates! On the\nsecond day he spent nineteen shillings on nothing whatever, and Ruth\ninsisted on his having tea with herself and Nellie at their\nboarding-house; for which of course he had to pay, while his own tea was\nwasting next door. So the figures ran on, jumping up each day.\nMercifully, when Sunday dawned the open wound in his pocket was\ntemporarily stanched. Ruth wished him to come in for tea again. He\nrefused--at any rate he did not come--and the exquisite placidity of the\nstream of their love was slightly disturbed.\n\nNobody could have guessed that she was in monetary difficulties on her\nown account. Denry, as a chivalrous lover, had assisted her out of the\nfearful quagmire of her rent; but she owed much beyond rent. Yet, when\nsome of her quarterly fees had come in, her thoughts had instantly run\nto Llandudno, joy, and frocks. She did not know what money was, and she\nnever would. This was, perhaps, part of her superior splendour. The\ngentle, timid, silent Nellie occasionally let Denry see that she, too,\nwas scandalised by her bosom friend's recklessness. Often Nellie would\nmodestly beg for permission to pay her share of the cost of an\namusement. And it seemed just to Denry that she should pay her share,\nand he violently wished to accept her money, but he could not. He would\neven get quite curt with her when she insisted. From this it will be\nseen how absurdly and irrationally different he was from the rest of us.\n\nNellie was continually with them, except just before they separated for\nthe night. So that Denry paid consistently for three. But he liked\nNellie Cotterill. She blushed so easily, and she so obviously worshipped\nRuth and admired himself, and there was a marked vein of common-sense in\nher ingenuous composition.\n\nOn the Monday morning he was up early and off to Bursley to collect\nrents and manage estates. He had spent nearly five pounds beyond his\nexpectation. Indeed, if by chance he had not gone to Llandudno with a\nportion of the previous week's rents in his pockets, he would have been\nin what the Five Towns call a fix.\n\nWhile in Bursley he thought a good deal. Bursley in August encourages\nnothing but thought. His mother was working as usual. His recitals to\nher of the existence led by betrothed lovers at Llandudno were vague.\n\nOn the Tuesday evening he returned to Llandudno, and, despite the\ngeneral trend of his thoughts, it once more occurred that his pockets\nwere loaded with a portion of the week's rents. He did not know\nprecisely what was going to happen, but he knew that something was going\nto happen; for the sufficient reason that his career could not continue\nunless something did happen. Without either a quarrel, an understanding,\nor a miracle, three months of affianced bliss with Ruth Earp would\nexhaust his resources and ruin his reputation as one who was ever equal\nto a crisis.\n\n\nIII\n\nWhat immediately happened was a storm at sea. He heard it mentioned at\nRhyl, and he saw, in the deep night, the foam of breakers at Prestatyn.\nAnd when the train reached Llandudno, those two girls in ulsters and\ncaps greeted him with wondrous tales of the storm at sea, and of wrecks,\nand of lifeboats. And they were so jolly, and so welcoming, so plainly\nglad to see their cavalier again, that Denry instantly discovered\nhimself to be in the highest spirits. He put away the dark and brooding\nthoughts which had disfigured his journey, and became the gay Denry of\nhis own dreams. The very wind intoxicated him. There was no rain.\n\nIt was half-past nine, and half Llandudno was afoot on the Parade and\ndiscussing the storm--a storm unparalleled, it seemed, in the month of\nAugust. At any rate, people who had visited Llandudno yearly for\ntwenty-five years declared that never had they witnessed such a storm.\nThe new lifeboat had gone forth, amid cheers, about six o'clock to a\nschooner in distress near Rhos, and at eight o'clock a second lifeboat\n(an old one which the new one had replaced and which had been bought for\na floating warehouse by an aged fisherman) had departed to the rescue of\na Norwegian barque, the _Hjalmar_, round the bend of the Little\nOrme.\n\n\"Let's go on the pier,\" said Denry. \"It will be splendid.\"\n\nHe was not an hour in the town, and yet was already hanging expense!\n\n\"They've closed the pier,\" the girls told him.\n\nBut when in the course of their meanderings among the excited crowd\nunder the gas-lamps they arrived at the pier-gates, Denry perceived\nfigures on the pier.\n\n\"They're sailors and things, and the Mayor,\" the girls explained.\n\n\"Pooh!\" said Denry, fired.\n\nHe approached the turnstile and handed a card to the official. It was\nthe card of an advertisement agent of the _Staffordshire Signal_,\nwho had called at Brougham Street in Denry's absence about the renewal\nof Denry's advertisement.\n\n\"Press,\" said Denry to the guardian at the turnstile, and went through\nwith the ease of a bird on the wing.\n\n\"Come along,\" he cried to the girls.\n\nThe guardian seemed to hesitate.\n\n\"These ladies are with me,\" he said.\n\nThe guardian yielded.\n\nIt was a triumph for Denry. He could read his triumph in the eyes of his\ncompanions. When she looked at him like that, Ruth was assuredly\nmarvellous among women, and any ideas derogatory to her marvellousness\nwhich he might have had at Bursley and in the train were false ideas.\n\nAt the head of the pier beyond the pavilion, there were gathered\ntogether some fifty people, and the tale ran that the second lifeboat\nhad successfully accomplished its mission and was approaching the pier.\n\n\"I shall write an account of this for the _Signal_,\" said Denry,\nwhose thoughts were excusably on the Press.\n\n\"Oh, do!\" exclaimed Nellie.\n\n\"They have the _Signal_ at all the newspaper shops here,\" said\nRuth.\n\nThen they seemed to be merged in the storm. The pier shook and trembled\nunder the shock of the waves, and occasionally, though the tide was very\nlow, a sprinkle of water flew up and caught their faces. The eyes could\nsee nothing save the passing glitter of the foam on the crest of a\nbreaker. It was the most thrilling situation that any of them had ever\nbeen in.\n\nAnd at last came word from the mouths of men who could apparently see as\nwell in the dark as in daylight, that the second lifeboat was close to\nthe pier. And then everybody momentarily saw it--a ghostly thing that\nheaved up pale out of the murk for an instant, and was lost again. And\nthe little crowd cheered.\n\nThe next moment a Bengal light illuminated the pier, and the lifeboat\nwas silhouetted with strange effectiveness against the storm. And some\none flung a rope, and then another rope arrived out of the sea, and fell\non Denry's shoulder.\n\n\"Haul on there!\" yelled a hoarse voice. The Bengal light expired.\n\nDenry hauled with a will. The occasion was unique. And those few seconds\nwere worth to him the whole of Denry's precious life--yes, not excluding\nthe seconds in which he had kissed Ruth and the minutes in which he had\ndanced with the Countess of Chell. Then two men with beards took the\nrope from his hands. The air was now alive with shoutings. Finally there\nwas a rush of men down the iron stairway to the lower part of the pier,\nten feet nearer the water.\n\n\"You stay here, you two!\" Denry ordered.\n\n\"But, Denry--\"\n\n\"Stay here, I tell you!\" All the male in him was aroused. He was off,\nafter the rush of men. \"Half a jiffy,\" he said, coming back. \"Just take\ncharge of this, will you?\" And he poured into their hands about twelve\nshillings' worth of copper, small change of rents, from his hip-pocket.\n\"If anything happened, that might sink me,\" he said, and vanished.\n\nIt was very characteristic of him, that effusion of calm sagacity in a\nsupreme emergency.\n\n\nIV\n\nBeyond getting his feet wet Denry accomplished but little in the dark\nbasement of the pier. In spite of his success in hauling in the thrown\nrope, he seemed to be classed at once down there by the experts\nassembled as an eager and useless person who had no right to the space\nwhich he occupied. However, he witnessed the heaving arrival of the\nlifeboat and the disembarking of the rescued crew of the Norwegian\nbarque, and he was more than ever decided to compose a descriptive\narticle for the _Staffordshire Signal._ The rescued and the\nrescuing crews disappeared in single file to the upper floor of the\npier, with the exception of the coxswain, a man with a spreading red\nbeard, who stayed behind to inspect the lifeboat, of which indeed he was\nthe absolute owner. As a journalist Denry did the correct thing and\nengaged him in conversation. Meanwhile, cheering could be heard above.\nThe coxswain, who stated that his name was Cregeen, and that he was a\nManxman, seemed to regret the entire expedition. He seemed to be unaware\nthat it was his duty now to play the part of the modest hero to Denry's\ninterviewing. At every loose end of the chat he would say gloomily:\n\n\"And look at her now, I'm telling ye!\" Meaning the battered craft, which\nrose and fell on the black waves.\n\nDenry ran upstairs again, in search of more amenable material. Some\ntwenty men in various sou'-westers and other headgear were eating thick\nslices of bread and butter and drinking hot coffee, which with foresight\nhad been prepared for them in the pier buffet. A few had preferred\nwhisky. The whole crowd was now under the lee of the pavilion, and it\nconstituted a spectacle which Denry said to himself he should refer to\nin his article as \"Rembrandtesque.\" For a few moments he could not\ndescry Ruth and Nellie in the gloom. Then he saw the indubitable form of\nhis betrothed at a penny-in-the-slot machine, and the indubitable form\nof Nellie at another penny-in-the-slot machine. And then he could hear\nthe click-click-click of the machines, working rapidly. And his thoughts\ntook a new direction.\n\nPresently Ruth ran with blithe gracefulness from her machine and\ncommenced a generous distribution of packets to the members of the\ncrews. There was neither calculation nor exact justice in her\ngenerosity. She dropped packets on to heroic knees with a splendid\ngesture of largesse. Some packets even fell on the floor. But she did\nnot mind.\n\nDenry could hear her saying:\n\n\"You must eat it. Chocolate is so sustaining. There's nothing like it.\"\n\nShe ran back to the machines, and snatched more packets from Nellie, who\nunder her orders had been industrious; and then began a second\ndistribution.\n\nA calm and disinterested observer would probably have been touched by\nthis spectacle of impulsive womanly charity. He might even have decided\nthat it was one of the most beautifully human things that he had ever\nseen. And the fact that the hardy heroes and Norsemen appeared scarcely\nto know what to do with the silver-wrapped bonbons would not have\nimpaired his admiration for these two girlish figures of benevolence.\nDenry, too, was touched by the spectacle, but in another way. It was the\nrents of his clients that were being thus dissipated in a very luxury of\nneedless benevolence. He muttered:\n\n\"Well, that's a bit thick, that is!\" But of course he could do nothing.\n\nAs the process continued, the clicking of the machine exacerbated his\nears.\n\n\"Idiotic!\" he muttered.\n\nThe final annoyance to him was that everybody except himself seemed to\nconsider that Ruth was displaying singular ingenuity, originality,\nenterprise, and goodness of heart.\n\nIn that moment he saw clearly for the first time that the marriage\nbetween himself and Ruth had not been arranged in Heaven. He admitted\nprivately then that the saving of a young woman from violent death in a\npantechnicon need not inevitably involve espousing her. She was without\ndoubt a marvellous creature, but it was as wise to dream of keeping a\ncarriage and pair as to dream of keeping Ruth. He grew suddenly cynical.\nHis age leaped to fifty or so, and the curve of his lips changed.\n\nRuth, spying around, saw him and ran to him with a glad cry.\n\n\"Here!\" she said, \"take these. They're no good.\" She held out her hands.\n\n\"What are they?\" he asked.\n\n\"They're the halfpennies.\"\n\n\"So sorry!\" he said, with an accent whose significance escaped her, and\ntook the useless coins.\n\n\"We've exhausted all the chocolate,\" said she. \"But there's butterscotch\nleft--it's nearly as good--and gold-tipped cigarettes. I daresay some of\nthem would enjoy a smoke. Have you got any more pennies?\"\n\n\"No!\" he replied. \"But I've got ten or a dozen half-crowns. They'll work\nthe machine just as well, won't they?\"\n\nThis time she did notice a certain unusualness in the flavour of his\naccent. And she hesitated.\n\n\"Don't be silly!\" she said.\n\n\"I'll try not to be,\" said Denry. So far as he could remember, he had\nnever used such a tone before. Ruth swerved away to rejoin Nellie.\n\nDenry surreptitiously counted the halfpennies. There were eighteen. She\nhad fed those machines, then, with over a hundred and thirty pence.\n\nHe murmured, \"Thick, thick!\"\n\nConsidering that he had returned to Llandudno in the full intention of\nputting his foot down, of clearly conveying to Ruth that his conception\nof finance differed from hers, the second sojourn had commenced badly.\nStill, he had promised to marry her, and he must marry her. Better a\nlifetime of misery and insolvency than a failure to behave as a\ngentleman should. Of course, if she chose to break it off.... But he\nmust be minutely careful to do nothing which might lead to a breach.\nSuch was Denry's code. The walk home at midnight, amid the\nreverberations of the falling tempest, was marked by a slight\npettishness on the part of Ruth, and by Denry's polite taciturnity.\n\n\nV\n\nYet the next morning, as the three companions sat together under the\nstriped awning of the buffet on the pier, nobody could have divined, by\nlooking at them, that one of them at any rate was the most uncomfortable\nyoung man in all Llandudno. The sun was hotly shining on their bright\nattire and on the still turbulent waves. Ruth, thirsty after a breakfast\nof herrings and bacon, was sucking iced lemonade up a straw. Nellie was\neating chocolate, undistributed remains of the night's benevolence. Denry\nwas yawning, not in the least because the proceedings failed to excite\nhis keen interest, but because he had been a journalist till three a.m.\nand had risen at six in order to despatch a communication to the editor\nof the _Staffordshire Signal_ by train. The girls were very\nplayful. Nellie dropped a piece of chocolate into Ruth's glass, and Ruth\nfished it out, and bit at it.\n\n\"What a jolly taste!\" she exclaimed.\n\nAnd then Nellie bit at it.\n\n\"Oh, it's just lovely!\" said Nellie, softly.\n\n\"Here, dear!\" said Ruth, \"try it.\"\n\nAnd Denry had to try it, and to pronounce it a delicious novelty (which\nindeed it was) and generally to brighten himself up. And all the time he\nwas murmuring in his heart, \"This can't go on.\"\n\nNevertheless, he was obliged to admit that it was he who had invited\nRuth to pass the rest of her earthly life with him, and not _vice\nversa_.\n\n\"Well, shall we go on somewhere else?\" Ruth suggested.\n\nAnd he paid yet again. He paid and smiled, he who had meant to be the\nmasterful male, he who deemed himself always equal to a crisis. But in\nthis crisis he was helpless.\n\nThey set off down the pier, brilliant in the brilliant crowd. Everybody\nwas talking of wrecks and lifeboats. The new lifeboat had done nothing,\nhaving been forestalled by the Prestatyn boat; but Llandudno was\napparently very proud of its brave old worn-out lifeboat which had\nbrought ashore the entire crew of the _Hjalmar,_ without casualty,\nin a terrific hurricane.\n\n\"Run along, child,\" said Ruth to Nellie, \"while uncle and auntie talk to\neach other for a minute.\"\n\nNellie stared, blushed, and walked forward in confusion. She was\nstartled. And Denry was equally startled. Never before had Ruth so\nbrazenly hinted that lovers must be left alone at intervals. In justice\nto her, it must be said that she was a mirror for all the proprieties.\nDenry had even reproached her, in his heart, for not sufficiently\nshowing her desire for his exclusive society. He wondered, now, what was\nto be the next revelation of her surprising character.\n\n\"I had our bill this morning,\" said Ruth.\n\nShe leaned gracefully on the handle of her sunshade, and they both\nstared at the sea. She was very elegant, with an aristocratic air. The\nbill, as she mentioned it, seemed a very negligible trifle.\nNevertheless, Denry's heart quaked.\n\n\"Oh!\" he said. \"Did you pay it?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said she. \"The landlady wanted the money, she told me. So Nellie\ngave me her share, and I paid it at once.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said Denry.\n\nThere was a silence. Denry felt as though he were defending a castle, or\nas though he were in a dark room and somebody was calling him, calling\nhim, and he was pretending not to be there and holding his breath.\n\n\"But I've hardly enough money left,\" said Ruth. \"The fact is, Nellie and\nI spent such a lot yesterday and the day before.... You've no idea how\nmoney goes!\"\n\n\"Haven't I?\" said Denry. But not to her--only to his own heart.\n\nTo her he said nothing.\n\n\"I suppose we shall have to go back home,\" she ventured lightly. \"One\ncan't run into debt here. They'd claim your luggage.\"\n\n\"What a pity!\" said Denry, sadly.\n\nJust those few words--and the interesting part of the interview was\nover! All that followed counted not in the least. She had meant to\ninduce him to offer to defray the whole of her expenses in Llandudno--no\ndoubt in the form of a loan; and she had failed. She had intended him to\nrepair the disaster caused by her chronic extravagance. And he had only\nsaid: \"What a pity!\"\n\n\"Yes, it is!\" she agreed bravely, and with a finer disdain than ever of\npetty financial troubles. \"Still, it can't be helped.\"\n\n\"No, I suppose not,\" said Denry.\n\nThere was undoubtedly something fine about Ruth. In that moment she had\nit in her to kill Denry with a bodkin. But she merely smiled. The\nsituation was terribly strained, past all Denry's previous conceptions\nof a strained situation; but she deviated with superlative\n_sang-froid_ into frothy small talk. A proud and an unconquerable\nwoman! After all, what were men for, if not to pay?\n\n\"I think I shall go home to-night,\" she said, after the excursion into\nprattle.\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" said Denry.\n\nHe was not coming out of his castle.\n\nAt that moment a hand touched his shoulder. It was the hand of Cregeen,\nthe owner of the old lifeboat.\n\n\"Mister,\" said Cregeen, too absorbed in his own welfare to notice Ruth.\n\"It's now or never! Five-and-twenty'll buy the _Fleetwing_, if\nten's paid down this mornun.\"\n\nAnd Denry replied boldly:\n\n\"You shall have it in an hour. Where shall you be?\"\n\n\"I'll be in John's cabin, under the pier,\" said Cregeen, \"where ye found\nme this mornun.\"\n\n\"Right,\" said Denry.\n\nIf Ruth had not been caracoling on her absurdly high horse, she would\nhave had the truth out of Denry in a moment concerning these early\nmorning interviews and mysterious transactions in shipping. But from\nthat height she could not deign to be curious. And so she said naught.\nDenry had passed the whole morning since breakfast and had uttered no\nword of pre-prandial encounters with mariners, though he had talked a\nlot about his article for the _Signal_ and of how he had risen\nbetimes in order to despatch it by the first train.\n\nAnd as Ruth showed no curiosity Denry behaved on the assumption that she\nfelt none. And the situation grew even more strained.\n\nAs they walked down the pier towards the beach, at the dinner-hour, Ruth\nbowed to a dandiacal man who obsequiously saluted her.\n\n\"Who's that?\" asked Denry, instinctively.\n\n\"It's a gentleman that I was once engaged to,\" answered Ruth, with cold,\nbrief politeness.\n\nDenry did not like this.\n\nThe situation almost creaked under the complicated stresses to which it\nwas subject. The wonder was that it did not fly to pieces long before\nevening.\n\n\nVI\n\nThe pride of the principal actors being now engaged, each person was\ncompelled to carry out the intentions which he had expressed either in\nwords or tacitly. Denry's silence had announced more efficiently than\nany words that he would under no inducement emerge from his castle. Ruth\nhad stated plainly that there was nothing for it but to go home at once,\nthat very night. Hence she arranged to go home, and hence Denry\nrefrained from interfering with her arrangements. Ruth was lugubrious\nunder a mask of gaiety; Nellie was lugubrious under no mask whatever.\nNellie was merely the puppet of these betrothed players, her elders. She\nadmired Ruth and she admired Denry, and between them they were spoiling\nthe little thing's holiday for their own adult purposes. Nellie knew\nthat dreadful occurrences were in the air--occurrences compared to which\nthe storm at sea was a storm in a tea-cup. She knew partly because Ruth\nhad been so queenly polite, and partly because they had come separately\nto St Asaph's Road and had not spent the entire afternoon together.\n\nSo quickly do great events loom up and happen that at six o'clock they\nhad had tea and were on their way afoot to the station. The odd man of\nNo. 26 St Asaph's Road had preceded them with the luggage. All the rest\nof Llandudno was joyously strolling home to its half-past six high tea--\ngrand people to whom weekly bills were as dust and who were in a\nposition to stop in Llandudno for ever and ever, if they chose! And Ruth\nand Nellie were conscious of the shame which always afflicts those whom\nnecessity forces to the railway station of a pleasure resort in the\nmiddle of the season. They saw omnibuses loaded with luggage and jolly\nsouls were actually _coming_, whose holiday had not yet properly\ncommenced. And this spectacle added to their humiliation and their\ndisgust. They genuinely felt that they belonged to the lower orders.\n\nRuth, for the sake of effect, joked on the most solemn subjects. She\neven referred with giggling laughter to the fact that she had borrowed\nfrom Nellie in order to discharge her liabilities for the final\ntwenty-four hours at the boarding-house. Giggling laughter being\ncontagious, as they were walking side by side close together, they all\nlaughed. And each one secretly thought how ridiculous was such\nbehaviour, and how it failed to reach the standard of true worldliness.\n\nThen, nearer the station, some sprightly caprice prompted Denry to raise\nhis hat to two young women who were crossing the road in front of them.\nNeither of the two young women responded to the homage.\n\n\"Who are they?\" asked Ruth, and the words were out of her mouth before\nshe could remind herself that curiosity was beneath her.\n\n\"It's a young lady I was once engaged to,\" said Denry.\n\n\"Which one?\" asked the ninny, Nellie, astounded.\n\n\"I forget,\" said Denry.\n\nHe considered this to be one of his greatest retorts--not to Nellie, but\nto Ruth. Nellie naturally did not appreciate its loveliness. But Ruth\ndid. There was no facet of that retort that escaped Ruth's critical\nnotice.\n\nAt length they arrived at the station, quite a quarter of an hour before\nthe train was due, and half-an-hour before it came in.\n\nDenry tipped the odd man for the transport of the luggage.\n\n\"Sure it's all there?\" he asked the girls, embracing both of them in his\ngaze.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Ruth, \"but where's yours?\"\n\n\"Oh!\" he said. \"I'm not going to-night. I've got some business to attend\nto here. I thought you understood. I expect you'll be all right, you two\ntogether.\"\n\nAfter a moment, Ruth said brightly: \"Oh yes! I was quite forgetting\nabout your business.\" Which was completely untrue, since she knew\nnothing of his business, and he had assuredly not informed her that he\nwould not return with them.\n\nBut Ruth was being very brave, haughty, and queenlike, and for this the\nprecise truth must sometimes be abandoned. The most precious thing in\nthe world to Ruth was her dignity--and who can blame her? She meant to\nkeep it at no matter what costs.\n\nIn a few minutes the bookstall on the platform attracted them as\ninevitably as a prone horse attracts a crowd. Other people were near the\nbookstall, and as these people were obviously leaving Llandudno, Ruth\nand Nellie felt a certain solace. The social outlook seemed brighter for\nthem. Denry bought one or two penny papers, and then the newsboy began\nto paste up the contents poster of the _Staffordshire Signal_,\nwhich had just arrived. And on this poster, very prominent, were the\nwords:--\"The Great Storm in North Wales. Special Descriptive Report.\"\nDenry snatched up one of the green papers and opened it, and on the\nfirst column of the news-page saw his wondrous description, including\nthe word \"Rembrandtesque.\" \"Graphic Account by a Bursley Gentleman of\nthe Scene at Llandudno,\" said the sub-title. And the article was\nintroduced by the phrase: \"We are indebted to Mr E.H. Machin, a\nprominent figure in Bursley,\" etc.\n\nIt was like a miracle. Do what he would, Denry could not stop his face\nfrom glowing.\n\nWith false calm he gave the paper, to Ruth. Her calmness in receiving it\nupset him.\n\n\"We'll read it in the train,\" she said primly, and started to talk about\nsomething else. And she became most agreeable and companionable.\n\nMixed up with papers and sixpenny novels on the bookstall were a number\nof souvenirs of Llandudno--paper-knives, pens, paper-weights,\nwatch-cases, pen-cases, all in light wood or glass, and ornamented with\ncoloured views of Llandudno, and also the word \"Llandudno\" in large\nGerman capitals, so that mistakes might not arise. Ruth remembered that\nshe had even intended to buy a crystal paper-weight with a view of the\nGreat Orme at the bottom. The bookstall clerk had several crystal\npaper-weights with views of the pier, the Hotel Majestic, the Esplanade,\nthe Happy Valley, but none with a view of the Great Orme. He had also\npaper-knives and watch-cases with a view of the Great Orme. But Ruth\nwanted a combination of paper-weight and Great Orme, and nothing else\nwould satisfy her. She was like that. The clerk admitted that such a\ncombination existed, but he was sold \"out of it.\"\n\n\"Couldn't you get one and send it to me?\" said Ruth.\n\nAnd Denry saw anew that she was incurable.\n\n\"Oh yes, miss,\" said the clerk. \"Certainly, miss. To-morrow at latest.\"\nAnd he pulled out a book. \"What name?\"\n\nRuth looked at Denry, as women do look on such occasions.\n\n\"Rothschild,\" said Denry.\n\nIt may seem perhaps strange that that single word ended their\nengagement. But it did. She could not tolerate a rebuke. She walked\naway, flushing. The bookstall clerk received no order. Several persons\nin the vicinity dimly perceived that a domestic scene had occurred, in a\nflash, under their noses, on a platform of a railway station. Nellie was\nspeedily aware that something very serious had happened, for the train\ntook them off without Ruth speaking a syllable to Denry, though Denry\nraised his hat and was almost effusive.\n\nThe next afternoon Denry received by post a ring in a box. \"I will not\nsubmit to insult,\" ran the brief letter.\n\n\"I only said 'Rothschild'!\" Denry murmured to himself. \"Can't a fellow\nsay 'Rothschild'?\"\n\nBut secretly he was proud of himself.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nTHE MERCANTILE MARINE\n\n\nI\n\nThe decisive scene, henceforward historic, occurred in the shanty known\nas \"John's cabin\"--John being the unacknowledged leader of the\nlong-shore population under the tail of Llandudno pier. The cabin,\nfestooned with cordage, was lighted by an oil-lamp of a primitive model,\nand round the orange case on which the lamp was balanced sat Denry,\nCregeen, the owner of the lifeboat, and John himself (to give, as it\nwere, a semi-official character to whatever was afoot).\n\n\"Well, here you are,\" said Denry, and handed to Cregeen a piece of\npaper.\n\n\"What's this, I'm asking ye?\" said Cregeen, taking the paper in his\nlarge fingers and peering at it as though it had been a papyrus.\n\nBut he knew quite well what it was. It was a cheque for twenty-five\npounds. What he did not know was that, with the ten pounds paid in cash\nearlier in the day, it represented a very large part indeed of such of\nDenry's savings as had survived his engagement to Ruth Earp. Cregeen\ntook a pen as though it had been a match-end and wrote a receipt. Then,\nafter finding a stamp in a pocket of his waistcoat under his jersey, he\nput it in his mouth and lost it there for a long time. Finally Denry got\nthe receipt, certifying that he was the owner of the lifeboat formerly\nknown as _Llandudno_, but momentarily without a name, together with\nall her gear and sails.\n\n\"Are ye going to live in her?\" the rather curt John inquired.\n\n\"Not in her. On her,\" said Denry.\n\nAnd he went out on to the sand and shingle, leaving John and Cregeen to\ncomplete the sale to Cregeen of the _Fleetwing_, a small cutter\nspecially designed to take twelve persons forth for \"a pleasant sail in\nthe bay.\" If Cregeen had not had a fancy for the _Fleetwing_ and a\nperfect lack of the money to buy her, Denry might never have been able\nto induce him to sell the lifeboat.\n\nUnder another portion of the pier Denry met a sailor with a long white\nbeard, the aged Simeon, who had been one of the crew that rescued the\n_Hjalmar_, but whom his colleagues appeared to regard rather as an\nornament than as a motive force.\n\n\"It's all right,\" said Denry.\n\nAnd Simeon, in silence, nodded his head slowly several times.\n\n\"I shall give you thirty shilling for the week,\" said Denry.\n\nAnd that venerable head oscillated again in the moon-lit gloom and\nrocked gradually to a stand-still.\n\nPresently the head said, in shrill, slow tones:\n\n\"I've seen three o' them Norwegian chaps. Two of 'em can no more speak\nEnglish than a babe unborn; no, nor understand what ye say to 'em,\nthough I fair bawled in their ear-holes.\"\n\n\"So much the better,\" said Denry.\n\n\"I showed 'em that sovereign,\" said the bearded head, wagging again.\n\n\"Well,\" said Denry, \"you won't forget. Six o'clock to-morrow morning.\"\n\n\"Ye'd better say five,\" the head suggested. \"Quieter like.\"\n\n\"Five, then,\" Denry agreed.\n\nAnd he departed to St Asaph's Road burdened with a tremendous thought.\n\nThe thought was:\n\n\"I've gone and done it this time!\"\n\nNow that the transaction was accomplished and could not be undone, he\nadmitted to himself that he had never been more mad. He could scarcely\ncomprehend what had led him to do that which he had done. But he\nobscurely imagined that his caprice for the possession of sea-going\ncraft must somehow be the result of his singular adventure with the\npantechnicon in the canal at Bursley. He was so preoccupied with\nmaterial interests as to be capable of forgetting, for a quarter of an\nhour at a stretch, that in all essential respects his life was wrecked,\nand that he had nothing to hope for save hollow worldly success. He knew\nthat Ruth would return the ring. He could almost see the postman holding\nthe little cardboard cube which would contain the rendered ring. He had\nloved, and loved tragically. (That was how he put it--in his unspoken\nthoughts; but the truth was merely that he had loved something too\nexpensive.) Now the dream was done. And a man of disillusion walked\nalong the Parade towards St Asaph's Road among revellers, a man with a\npast, a man who had probed women, a man who had nothing to learn about\nthe sex. And amid all the tragedy of his heart, and all his\napprehensions concerning hollow, worldly success, little thoughts of\nabsurd unimportance kept running about like clockwork mice in his head.\nSuch as that it would be a bit of a bore to have to tell people at\nBursley that his engagement, which truly had thrilled the town, was\nbroken off. Humiliating, that! And, after all, Ruth was a glittering gem\namong women. Was there another girl in Bursley so smart, so effective,\nso truly ornate?\n\nThen he comforted himself with the reflection: \"I'm certainly the only\nman that ever ended an engagement by just saying 'Rothschild!'\" This was\nprobably true. But it did not help him to sleep.\n\n\nII\n\nThe next morning at 5.20 the youthful sun was shining on the choppy\nwater of the Irish Sea, just off the Little Orme, to the west of\nLlandudno Bay. Oscillating on the uneasy waves was Denry's lifeboat,\nmanned by the nodding bearded head, three ordinary British longshoremen,\na Norwegian who could speak English of two syllables, and two other\nNorwegians who by a strange neglect of education could speak nothing but\nNorwegian.\n\nClose under the headland, near a morsel of beach lay the remains of the\n_Hjalmar_ in an attitude of repose. It was as if the _Hjalmar_, after a\nlong struggle, had lain down like a cab-horse and said to the tempest:\n\"Do what you like now!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" the venerable head was piping. \"Us can come out comfortable in\ntwenty minutes, unless the tide be setting east strong. And, as for\ngetting back, it'll be the same, other way round, if ye understand me.\"\n\nThere could be no question that Simeon had come out comfortable. But he\nwas the coxswain. The rowers seemed to be perspiringly aware that the\nboat was vast and beamy.\n\n\"Shall we row up to it?\" Simeon inquired, pointing to the wreck.\n\nThen a pale face appeared above the gunwale, and an expiring, imploring\nvoice said: \"No. We'll go back.\" Whereupon the pale face vanished again.\n\nDenry had never before been outside the bay. In the navigation of\npantechnicons on the squall-swept basins of canals he might have been a\ngreat master, but he was unfitted for the open sea. At that moment he\nwould have been almost ready to give the lifeboat and all that he owned\nfor the privilege of returning to land by train. The inward journey was\nso long that Denry lost hope of ever touching his native island again.\nAnd then there was a bump. And he disembarked, with hope burning up\nagain cheerfully in his bosom. And it was a quarter to six.\n\nBy the first post, which arrived at half-past seven, there came a brown\npackage. \"The ring!\" he thought, starting horribly. But the package was\na cube of three inches, and would have held a hundred rings. He undid\nthe cover, and saw on half a sheet of notepaper the words:--\n\n  \"Thank you so much for the lovely time you gave me. I hope you will\n  like this, NELLIE.\"\n\nHe was touched. If Ruth was hard, mercenary, costly, her young and\ningenuous companion could at any rate be grateful and sympathetic. Yes,\nhe was touched. He had imagined himself to be dead to all human\naffections, but it was not so. The package contained chocolate, and his\nnose at once perceived that it was chocolate impregnated with lemon--the\nsurprising but agreeable compound accidentally invented by Nellie on the\nprevious day at the pier buffet. The little thing must have spent a part\nof the previous afternoon in preparing it, and she must have put the\npackage in the post at Crewe. Secretive and delightful little thing!\nAfter his recent experience beyond the bay he had imagined himself to be\nincapable of ever eating again, but it was not so. The lemon gave a\npeculiar astringent, appetising, _settling_ quality to the\nchocolate. And he ate even with gusto. The result was that, instead of\nwaiting for the nine o'clock boarding-house breakfast, he hurried\nenergetically into the streets and called on a jobbing printer whom he\nhad seen on the previous evening. As Ruth had said, \"There is nothing\nlike chocolate for sustaining you.\"\n\n\nIII\n\nAt ten o'clock two Norwegian sailors, who could only smile in answer to\nthe questions which assailed them, were distributing the following\nhandbill on the Parade:--\n\n  WRECK OF THE _HJALMAR_\n\n  HEROISM AT LLANDUDNO\n\n  Every hour, at 11, 12, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 o'oclock,[sic] THE IDENTICAL\n  (guaranteed) LIFEBOAT which rescued the crew of the\n\n  _HJALMAR_\n\n  will leave the beach for the scene of the wreck Manned by Simeon\n  Edwards, the oldest boatman in LLANDUDNO, and by members of the\n  rescued crew, genuine Norwegians (guaranteed)\n\n  SIMEON EDWARDS, _Coxswain_.\n\n  Return Fare, with use of Cork Belt and Life-lines if desired, 2s. 6d.\n\n  A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY\n\n  A UNIQUE EXPERIENCE\n\n  _P.S._--The bravery of the lifeboatmen has been the theme of the\n  Press throughout the Principality and neighbouring counties.\n\n  E.D. MACHIN.\n\nAt eleven o'clock there was an eager crowd down on the beach where, with\nsome planks and a piece of rock, Simeon had arranged an embarkation pier\nfor the lifeboat. One man, in overalls, stood up to his knees in the\nwater and escorted passengers up the planks, while Simeon's\nconfidence-generating beard received them into the broad waist of the\nboat. The rowers wore sou'westers and were secured to the craft by\nlife-lines, and these conveniences were also offered, with life-belts,\nto the intrepid excursionists. A paper was pinned in the stern:\n\"Licensed to carry Fourteen.\" (Denry had just paid the fee.) But quite\nforty people were anxious to make the first voyage.\n\n\"No more,\" shrilled Simeon, solemnly. And the wader scrambled in and the\nboat slid away.\n\n\"Fares, please!\" shrilled Simeon.\n\nHe collected one pound fifteen, and slowly buttoned it up in the\nright-hand pocket of his blue trousers.\n\n\"Now, my lads, with a will,\" he gave the order. And then, with\ndeliberate method, he lighted his pipe. And the lifeboat shot away.\n\nClose by the planks stood a young man in a negligent attitude, and with\na look on his face as if to say: \"Please do not imagine that I have the\nslightest interest in this affair.\" He stared consistently out to sea\nuntil the boat had disappeared round the Little Orme, and then he took a\nfew turns on the sands, in and out amid the castles. His heart was\nbeating in a most disconcerting manner. After a time he resumed his\nperusal of the sea. And the lifeboat reappeared and grew larger and\nlarger, and finally arrived at the spot from which it had departed, only\nhigher up the beach because the tide was rising. And Simeon debarked\nfirst, and there was a small blue and red model of a lifeboat in his\nhand, which he shook to a sound of coins.\n\n\"_For_ the Lifeboat Fund! _For_ the Lifeboat Fund!\" he gravely\nintoned.\n\nEvery debarking passenger dropped a coin into the slit.\n\nIn five minutes the boat was refilled, and Simeon had put the value of\nfourteen more half-crowns into his pocket.\n\nThe lips of the young man on the beach moved, and he murmured:\n\n\"That makes over three pounds! Well, I'm dashed!\"\n\nAt the hour appointed for dinner he went to St Asaph's Road, but could\neat nothing. He could only keep repeating very softly to himself, \"Well,\nI'm dashed!\"\n\nThroughout the afternoon the competition for places in the lifeboat grew\nkeener and more dangerous. Denry's craft was by no means the sole craft\nengaged in carrying people to see the wreck. There were dozens of boats\nin the business, which had suddenly sprung up that morning, the sea\nbeing then fairly inoffensive for the first time since the height of the\nstorm. But the other boats simply took what the lifeboat left. The\nguaranteed identity of the lifeboat, and of the Norsemen (who replied to\nquestions in gibberish), and of Simeon himself; the sou'westers, the\nlife-belts and the lines; even the collection for the Lifeboat Fund at\nthe close of the voyage: all these matters resolved themselves into a\nfascination which Llandudno could not resist.\n\nAnd in regard to the collection, a remarkable crisis arose. The model of\na lifeboat became full, gorged to the slot. And the Local Secretary of\nthe Fund had the key. The model was despatched to him by special\nmessenger to open and to empty, and in the meantime Simeon used his\nsou'-wester as a collecting-box. This contretemps was impressive. At\nnight Denry received twelve pounds odd at the hands of Simeon Edwards.\nHe showered the odd in largesse on his heroic crew, who had also\nreceived many tips. By the evening post the fatal ring arrived from\nRuth, as he anticipated. He was just about to throw it into the sea,\nwhen he thought better of the idea, and stuck it in his pocket. He tried\nstill to feel that his life had been blighted by Ruth. But he could not.\nThe twelve pounds, largely in silver, weighed so heavy in his pocket. He\nsaid to himself: \"Of course this can't last!\"\n\n\nIV\n\nThen came the day when he first heard some one saying discreetly behind\nhim:\n\n\"That's the lifeboat chap!\"\n\nOr more briefly:\n\n\"That's him!\"\n\nImplying that in all Llandudno \"him\" could mean only one person.\n\nAnd for a time he went about the streets self-consciously. However, that\nself-consciousness soon passed off, and he wore his fame as easily as he\nwore his collar.\n\nThe lifeboat trips to the _Hjalmar_ became a feature of daily life\nin Llandudno. The pronunciation of the ship's name went through a\ntroublous period. Some said the \"j\" ought to be pronounced to the\nexclusion of the \"h,\" and others maintained the contrary. In the end the\nfirst two letters were both abandoned utterly, also the last--but nobody\nhad ever paid any attention to the last. The facetious had a trick of\ncalling the wreck _Inkerman_. This definite settlement of the\npronunciation of the name was a sign that the pleasure-seekers of\nLlandudno had definitely fallen in love with the lifeboat-trip habit.\nDenry's timid fear that the phenomenon which put money into his pocket\ncould not continue, was quite falsified. It continued violently. And\nDenry wished that the _Hjalmar_ had been wrecked a month earlier.\nHe calculated that the tardiness of the _Hjalmar_ in wrecking\nitself had involved him in a loss of some four hundred pounds. If only\nthe catastrophe had happened early in July, instead of early in August,\nand he had been there. Why, if forty _Hjalmars_ had been wrecked,\nand their forty crews saved by forty different lifeboats, and Denry had\nbought all the lifeboats, he could have filled them all!\n\nStill, the regularity of his receipts was extremely satisfactory and\ncomforting. The thing had somehow the air of being a miracle; at any\nrate of being connected with magic. It seemed to him that nothing could\nhave stopped the visitors to Llandudno from fighting for places in his\nlifeboat and paying handsomely for the privilege. They had begun the\npractice, and they looked as if they meant to go on with the practice\neternally. He thought that the monotony of it would strike them\nunfavourably. But no! He thought that they would revolt against doing\nwhat every one had done. But no! Hundreds of persons arrived fresh from\nthe railway station every day, and they all appeared to be drawn to that\nlifeboat as to a magnet. They all seemed to know instantly and\ninstinctively that to be correct in Llandudno they must make at least\none trip in Denry's lifeboat.\n\nHe was pocketing an income which far exceeded his most golden visions.\nAnd therefore naturally his first idea was to make that income larger\nand larger still. He commenced by putting up the price of the afternoon\ntrips. There was a vast deal too much competition for seats in the\nafternoon. This competition led to quarrels, unseemly language, and\ndeplorable loss of temper. It also led to loss of time. Denry was\ntherefore benefiting humanity by charging three shillings after two\no'clock. This simple and benign device equalised the competition\nthroughout the day, and made Denry richer by seven or eight pounds a\nweek.\n\nBut his fertility of invention did not stop there. One morning the\nearliest excursionists saw a sort of Robinson Crusoe marooned on the\nstrip of beach near the wreck. All that heartless fate had left him\nappeared to be a machine on a tripod and a few black bags. And there was\nno shelter for him save a shallow cave. The poor fellow was quite\nrespectably dressed. Simeon steered the boat round by the beach, which\nshelved down sharply, and as he did so the Robinson Crusoe hid his head\nin a cloth, as though ashamed, or as though he had gone mad and believed\nhimself to be an ostrich. Then apparently he thought the better of it,\nand gazed boldly forth again. And the boat passed on its starboard side\nwithin a dozen feet of him and his machine. Then it put about and passed\non the port side. And the same thing occurred on every trip. And the\nlast trippers of the day left Robinson Crusoe on the strip of beach in\nhis solitude.\n\nThe next morning a photographer's shop on the Parade pulled down its\nshutters and displayed posters all over the upper part of its windows.\nAnd the lower part of the windows held sixteen different large\nphotographs of the lifeboat broad-side on. The likenesses of over a\nhundred visitors, many of them with sou'-westers, cork belts, and\nlife-lines, could be clearly distinguished in these picturesque groups.\nA notice said:--\n\n\"_Copies of any of these magnificent permanent holographs can be\nsupplied, handsomely mounted, at a charge of two shillings each. Orders\nexecuted in rotation, and delivered by post if necessary. It is\nrespectfully requested that cash be paid with order. Otherwise orders\ncannot be accepted._\"\n\nVery few of those who had made the trip could resist the fascination of\na photograph of themselves in a real lifeboat, manned by real heroes and\nreal Norwegians on real waves, especially if they had worn the gear\nappropriate to lifeboats. The windows of the shop were beset throughout\nthe day with crowds anxious to see who was in the lifeboat, and who had\ncome out well, and who was a perfect fright. The orders on the first day\namounted to over fifteen pounds, for not everybody was content with one\nphotograph. The novelty was acute and enchanting, and it renewed itself\neach day. \"Let's go down and look at the lifeboat photographs,\" people\nwould say, when they were wondering what to do next. Some persons who\nhad not \"taken nicely\" would perform a special trip in the lifeboat and\nwould wear special clothes and compose special faces for the ordeal. The\nMayor of Ashby-de-la-Zouch for that year ordered two hundred copies of a\nphotograph which showed himself in the centre, for presentation as New\nYear's cards. On the mornings after very dull days or wet days, when\nphotography had been impossible or unsatisfactory, Llandudno felt that\nsomething lacked. Here it may be mentioned that inclement weather (of\nwhich, for the rest, there was little) scarcely interfered with Denry's\nreceipts. Imagine a lifeboat being deterred by rain or by a breath of\nwind! There were tarpaulins. When the tide was strong and adverse, male\npassengers were allowed to pull, without extra charge, though naturally\nthey would give a trifle to this or that member of the professional\ncrew.\n\nDenry's arrangement with the photographer was so simple that a child\ncould have grasped it. The photographer paid him sixpence on every\nphotograph sold. This was Denry's only connection with the photographer.\nThe sixpences totalled over a dozen pounds a week. Regardless of cost,\nDenry reprinted his article from the _Staffordshire Signal_\ndescriptive of the night of the wreck, with a photograph of the lifeboat\nand its crew, and presented a copy to every client of his photographic\ndepartment.\n\n\nV\n\nLlandudno was next titillated by the mysterious \"Chocolate Remedy,\"\nwhich made its first appearance in a small boat that plied off Robinson\nCrusoe's strip of beach. Not infrequently passengers in the lifeboat\nwere inconvenienced by displeasing and even distressing sensations, as\nDenry had once been inconvenienced. He felt deeply for them. The\nChocolate Remedy was designed to alleviate the symptoms while\ncaptivating the palate. It was one of the most agreeable remedies that\nthe wit of man ever invented. It tasted like chocolate and yet there was\nan astringent flavour of lemon in it--a flavour that flattered the\nstomach into a good opinion of itself, and seemed to say, \"All's right\nwith the world.\" The stuff was retailed in sixpenny packets, and you\nwere advised to eat only a very little of it at a time, and not to\nmasticate, but merely to permit melting. Then the Chocolate Remedy came\nto be sold on the lifeboat itself, and you were informed that if you\n\"took\" it before starting on the wave, no wave could disarrange you.\nAnd, indeed, many persons who followed this advice suffered no distress,\nand were proud accordingly, and duly informed the world. Then the\nChocolate Remedy began to be sold everywhere. Young people bought it\nbecause they enjoyed it, and perfectly ignored the advice against\nover-indulgence and against mastication. The Chocolate Remedy penetrated\nlike the refrain of a popular song to other seaside places. It was on\nsale from Morecambe to Barmouth, and at all the landing-stages of the\nsteamers for the Isle of Man and Anglesey. Nothing surprised Denry so\nmuch as the vogue of the Chocolate Remedy. It was a serious anxiety to\nhim, and he muddled both the manufacture and distribution of the remedy,\nfrom simple ignorance and inexperience. His chief difficulty at first\nhad been to obtain small cakes of chocolate that were not stamped with\nthe maker's name or mark. Chocolate manufacturers seemed to have a\npassion for imprinting their Quakerly names on every bit of stuff they\nsold. Having at length obtained a supply, he was silly enough to spend\ntime in preparing the remedy himself in his bedroom! He might as well\nhave tried to feed the British Army from his mother's kitchen. At length\nhe went to a confectioner in Rhyl and a greengrocer in Llandudno, and by\ngiving away half the secret to each, he contrived to keep the whole\nsecret to himself. But even then he was manifestly unequal to the\nsituation created by the demand for the Chocolate Remedy. It was a\nsituation that needed the close attention of half a dozen men of\nbusiness. It was quite different from the affair of the lifeboat.\n\nOne night a man who had been staying a day or two in the boarding-house\nin St Asaph's Road said to Denry:\n\n\"Look here, mister. I go straight to the point. What'll you take?\"\n\nAnd he explained what he meant. What would Denry take for the entire\nsecret and rights of the Chocolate Remedy and the use of the name\n\"Machin\" (\"without which none was genuine\").\n\n\"What do you offer?\" Denry asked.\n\n\"Well, I'll give you a hundred pounds down, and that's my last word.\"\n\nDenry was staggered. A hundred pounds for simply nothing at all--for\ndipping bits of chocolate in lemon-juice!\n\nHe shook his head.\n\n\"I'll take two hundred,\" he replied.\n\nAnd he got two hundred. It was probably the worst bargain that he ever\nmade in his life. For the Chocolate Remedy continued obstinately in\ndemand for ten years afterwards. But he was glad to be rid of the thing;\nit was spoiling his sleep and wearing him out.\n\nHe had other worries. The boatmen of Llandudno regarded him as an enemy\nof the human race. If they had not been nature's gentlemen they would\nhave burned him alive at a stake. Cregeen, in particular, consistently\nreferred to him in terms which could not have been more severe had Denry\nbeen the assassin of Cregeen's wife and seven children. In daring to\nmake over a hundred pounds a week out of a ramshackle old lifeboat that\nCregeen had sold to him for thirty-five pounds, Denry was outraging\nCregeen's moral code. Cregeen had paid thirty-five pounds for the\n_Fleetwinz_, a craft immeasurably superior to Denry's nameless tub.\nAnd was Cregeen making a hundred pounds a week out of it? Not a hundred\nshillings! Cregeen genuinely thought that he had a right to half Denry's\nprofits. Old Simeon, too, seemed to think that _he_ had a right to\na large percentage of the same profits. And the Corporation, though it\nwas notorious that excursionists visited the town purposely to voyage in\nthe lifeboat, the Corporation made difficulties--about the embarking and\ndisembarking, about the photographic strip of beach, about the crowds on\nthe pavement outside the photograph shop. Denry learnt that he had\ncommitted the sin of not being a native of Llandudno. He was a stranger,\nand he was taking money out of the town. At times he wished he could\nhave been born again. His friend and saviour was the Local Secretary of\nthe Lifeboat Institution, who happened to be a Town Councillor. This\nworthy man, to whom Denry paid over a pound a day, was invaluable to\nhim. Further, Denry was invited--nay commanded--to contribute to nearly\nevery church, chapel, mission, and charity in Carnarvonshire,\nFlintshire, and other counties. His youthfulness was not accepted as an\nexcuse. And as his gross profits could be calculated by any dunce who\nchose to stand on the beach for half a day, it was not easy for him to\npretend that he was on the brink of starvation. He could only ward off\nattacks by stating with vague, convinced sadness that his expenses were\nmuch greater than any one could imagine.\n\nIn September, when the moon was red and full, and the sea glassy, he\nannounced a series of nocturnal \"Rocket F\u00c3\u00aates.\" The lifeboat, hung with\nChinese lanterns, put out in the evening (charge five shillings) and,\nfollowed by half the harbour's fleet of rowing-boats and cutters,\nproceeded to the neighbourhood of the strip of beach, where a rocket\napparatus had been installed by the help of the Lifeboat Secretary. The\nmortar was trained; there was a flash, a whizz, a line of fire, and a\nrope fell out of the sky across the lifeboat. The effect was thrilling\nand roused cheers. Never did the Lifeboat Institution receive such an\nadvertisement as Denry gave it--gratis.\n\nAfter the rocketing Denry stood alone on the slopes of the Little Orme\nand watched the lanterns floating home over the water, and heard the\nlusty mirth of his clients in the still air. It was an emotional\nexperience for him.\n\n\"By Jove!\" he said, \"I've wakened this town up!\"\n\n\nVI\n\nOne morning, in the very last sad days of the dying season, when his\nreceipts had dropped to the miserable figure of about fifty pounds a\nweek, Denry had a great and pleasing surprise. He met Nellie on the\nParade. It was a fact that the recognition of that innocent, childlike\nblushing face gave him joy. Nellie was with her father, Councillor\nCotterill, and her mother. The Councillor was a speculative builder, who\nwas erecting several streets of British homes in the new quarter above\nthe new municipal park at Bursley. Denry had already encountered him\nonce or twice in the way of business. He was a big and portly man of\nforty-five, with a thin face and a consciousness of prosperity. At one\nmoment you would think him a jolly, bluff fellow, and at the next you\nwould be disconcerted by a note of cunning or of harshness. Mrs\nCouncillor Cotterill was one of these women who fail to live up to the\never-increasing height of their husbands. Afflicted with an eternal\nstage-fright, she never opened her close-pressed lips in society, though\na few people knew that she could talk as fast and as effectively as any\none. Difficult to set in motion, her vocal machinery was equally\ndifficult to stop. She generally wore a low bonnet and a mantle. The\nCotterills had been spending a fortnight in the Isle of Man, and they\nhad come direct from Douglas to Llandudno by steamer, where they meant\nto pass two or three days. They were staying at Craig-y-don, at the\neastern end of the Parade.\n\n\"Well, young man!\" said Councillor Cotterill.\n\nAnd he kept on young-manning Denry with an easy patronage which Denry\ncould scarcely approve of. \"I bet I've made more money this summer than\nyou have with all your jerrying!\" said Denry silently to the\nCouncillor's back while the Cotterill family were inspecting the\nhistoric lifeboat on the beach. Councillor Cotterill said frankly that\none reason for their calling at Llandudno was his desire to see this\nsingular lifeboat, about which there had really been a very great deal\nof talk in the Five Towns. The admission comforted Denry. Then the\nCouncillor recommenced his young-manning.\n\n\"Look here,\" said Denry, carelessly, \"you must come and dine with me one\nnight, all of you--will you?\"\n\nNobody who has not passed at least twenty years in a district where\npeople dine at one o'clock, and dining after dark is regarded as a wild\nidiosyncrasy of earls, can appreciate the effect of this speech.\n\nThe Councillor, when he had recovered himself, said that they would be\npleased to dine with him; Mrs Cotterill's tight lips were seen to move,\nbut not heard; and Nellie glowed.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Denry, \"come and dine with me at the Majestic.\"\n\nThe name of the Majestic put an end to the young-manning. It was the new\nhotel by the pier, and advertised itself as the most luxurious hotel in\nthe Principality. Which was bold of it, having regard to the\nmagnificence of caravanserais at Cardiff. It had two hundred bedrooms,\nand waiters who talked English imperfectly; and its prices were supposed\nto be fantastic.\n\nAfter all, the most startled and frightened person of the four was\nperhaps Denry. He had never given a dinner to anybody. He had never even\ndined at night. He had never been inside the Majestic. He had never had\nthe courage to go inside the Majestic. He had no notion of the\nmysterious preliminaries to the offering of a dinner in a public place.\n\nBut the next morning he contracted to give away the lifeboat to a\nsyndicate of boatmen, headed by John their leader, for thirty-five\npounds. And he swore to himself that he would do that dinner properly,\neven if it cost him the whole price of the boat. Then he met Mrs\nCotterill coming out of a shop. Mrs Cotterill, owing to a strange hazard\nof fate, began talking at once. And Denry, as an old shorthand writer,\ninstinctively calculated that not Thomas Allen Reed himself could have\ntaken Mrs Cotterill down verbatim. Her face tried to express pain, but\npleasure shone out of it. For she found herself in an exciting\ncontretemps which she could understand.\n\n\"Oh, Mr Machin,\" she said, \"what _do_ you think's happened? I don't\nknow how to tell you, I'm sure. Here you've arranged for that dinner\nto-morrow and it's all settled, and now Miss Earp telegraphs to our\nNellie to say she's coming to-morrow for a day or two with us. You know\nRuth and Nellie are _such_ friends. It's like as if what must be,\nisn't it? I don't know what to do, I do declare. What _ever_ will\nRuth say at us leaving her all alone the first night she comes? I really\ndo think she might have----\"\n\n\"You must bring her along with you,\" said Denry.\n\n\"But won't you--shan't you--won't she--won't it----\"\n\n\"Not at all,\" said Denry. \"Speaking for myself, I shall be delighted.\"\n\n\"Well, I'm sure you're very sensible,\" said Mrs Cotterill. \"I was but\nsaying to Mr Cotterill over breakfast--I said to him----\"\n\n\"I shall ask Councillor Rhys-Jones to meet you,\" said Denry. \"He's one\nof the principal members of the Town Council here; Local Secretary of\nthe Lifeboat Institution. Great friend of mine.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" exclaimed Mrs Cotterill, \"it'll be quite an affair.\"\n\nIt was.\n\nDenry found to his relief that the only difficult part of arranging a\ndinner at the Majestic was the steeling of yourself to enter the\ngorgeous portals of the hotel. After that, and after murmuring that you\nwished to fix up a little snack, you had nothing to do but listen to\nsuggestions, each surpassing the rest in splendour, and say \"Yes.\"\nSimilarly with the greeting of a young woman who was once to you the\njewel of the world. You simply said, \"Good-afternoon, how are you?\" And\nshe said the same. And you shook hands. And there you were, still alive!\n\nThe one defect of the dinner was that the men were not in evening dress.\n(Denry registered a new rule of life: Never travel without your evening\ndress, because you never know what may turn up.) The girls were\nradiantly white. And after all there is nothing like white. Mrs\nCotterill was in black silk and silence. And after all there is nothing\nlike black silk. There was champagne. There were ices. Nellie, not being\npermitted champagne, took her revenge in ice. Denry had found an\nopportunity to relate to her the history of the Chocolate Remedy. She\nsaid, \"How wonderful you are!\" And he said it was she who was wonderful.\nDenry gave no information about the Chocolate Remedy to her father.\nNeither did she. As for Ruth, indubitably she was responsible for the\nsocial success of the dinner. She seemed to have the habit of these\naffairs. She it was who loosed tongues. Nevertheless, Denry saw her now\nwith different eyes, and it appeared incredible to him that he had once\nmistaken her for the jewel of the world.\n\nAt the end of the dinner Councillor Rhys-Jones produced a sensation by\nrising to propose the health of their host. He referred to the superb\nheroism of England's lifeboatmen, and in the name of the Institution\nthanked Denry for the fifty-three pounds which Denry's public had\ncontributed to the funds. He said it was a noble contribution and that\nDenry was a philanthropist. And he called on Councillor Cotterill to\nsecond the toast. Which Councillor Cotterill did, in good set terms, the\nresult of long habit. And Denry stammered that he was much obliged, and\nthat really it was nothing.\n\nBut when the toasting was finished, Councillor Cotterill lapsed somewhat\ninto a patronising irony, as if he were jealous of a youthful success.\nAnd he did not stop at \"young man.\" He addressed Denry grandiosely as\n\"my boy.\"\n\n\"This lifeboat--it was just an idea, my boy, just an idea,\" he said.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Denry, \"but I thought of it.\"\n\n\"The question is,\" said the Councillor, \"can you think of any more ideas\nas good?\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Denry, \"can _you_?\"\n\nWith reluctance they left the luxury of the private dining-room, and\nDenry surreptitiously paid the bill with a pile of sovereigns, and\nCouncillor Rhys-Jones parted from them with lively grief. The other five\nwalked in a row along the Parade in the moonlight. And when they arrived\nin front of Craig-y-don, and the Cotterills were entering, Ruth, who\nloitered behind, said to Denry in a liquid voice:\n\n\"I don't feel a bit like going to sleep. I suppose you wouldn't care for\na stroll?\"\n\n\"Well------\"\n\n\"I daresay you're very tired,\" she said.\n\n\"No,\" he replied, \"it's this moonlight I'm afraid of.\"\n\nAnd their eyes met under the door-lamp, and Ruth wished him pleasant\ndreams and vanished. It was exceedingly subtle.\n\n\nVII\n\nThe next afternoon the Cotterills and Ruth Earp went home, and Denry\nwith them. Llandudno was just settling into its winter sleep, and\nDenry's rather complex affairs had all been put in order. Though the\nothers showed a certain lassitude, he himself was hilarious. Among his\ninsignificant luggage was a new hat-box, which proved to be the origin\nof much gaiety.\n\n\"Just take this, will you?\" he said to a porter on the platform at\nLlandudno Station, and held out the new hat-box with an air of calm. The\nporter innocently took it, and then, as the hat-box nearly jerked his\narm out of the socket, gave vent to his astonishment after the manner of\nporters.\n\n\"By gum, mister!\" said he, \"that's heavy!\"\n\nIt, in fact, weighed nearly two stone.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Denry, \"it's full of sovereigns, of course.\"\n\nAnd everybody laughed.\n\nAt Crewe, where they had to change, and again at Knype and at Bursley,\nhe produced astonishment in porters by concealing the effort with which\nhe handed them the hat-box, as though its weight was ten ounces. And\neach time he made the same witticism about sovereigns.\n\n\"What _have_ you got in that hat-box?\" Ruth asked.\n\n\"Don't I tell you?\" said Denry, laughing. \"Sovereigns!\"\n\nLastly, he performed the same trick on his mother. Mrs Machin was\nworking, as usual, in the cottage in Brougham Street. Perhaps the notion\nof going to Llandudno for a change had not occurred to her. In any case,\nher presence had been necessary in Bursley, for she had frequently\ncollected Denry's rents for him, and collected them very well. Denry was\nglad to see her again, and she was glad to see him, but they concealed\ntheir feelings as much as possible. When he basely handed her the\nhat-box she dropped it, and roundly informed him that she was not going\nto have any of his pranks.\n\nAfter tea, whose savouriness he enjoyed quite as much as his own state\ndinner, he gave her a key and asked her to open the hat-box, which he\nhad placed on a chair.\n\n\"What is there in it?\"\n\n\"A lot of jolly fine pebbles that I've been collecting on the beach,\" he\nsaid.\n\nShe got the hat-box on to her knee, and unlocked it, and came to a thick\ncloth, which she partly withdrew, and then there was a scream from Mrs\nMachin, and the hat-box rolled with a terrific crash to the tiled floor,\nand she was ankle-deep in sovereigns. She could see sovereigns running\nabout all over the parlour. Gradually even the most active sovereigns\ndecided to lie down and be quiet, and a great silence ensued. Denry's\nheart was beating.\n\nMrs Machin merely shook her head. Not often did her son deprive her of\nwords, but this theatrical culmination of his home-coming really did\nleave her speechless.\n\nLate that night rows of piles of sovereigns decorated the oval table in\nthe parlour.\n\n\"A thousand and eleven,\" said Denry, at length, beneath the lamp.\n\"There's fifteen missing yet. We'll look for 'em to-morrow.\"\n\nFor several days afterwards Mrs Machin was still picking up sovereigns.\nTwo had even gone outside the parlour, and down the two steps into the\nbackyard, and finding themselves unable to get back, had remained there.\n\nAnd all the town knew that the unique Denry had thought of the idea of\nreturning home to his mother with a hat-box crammed with sovereigns.\n\nThis was Denry's \"latest,\" and it employed the conversation of the\nborough for I don't know how long.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nHIS BURGLARY\n\n\nI\n\nThe fact that Denry Machin decided not to drive behind his mule to Sneyd\nHall showed in itself that the enterprise of interviewing the Countess\nof Chell was not quite the simple daily trifling matter that he strove\nto pretend it was.\n\nThe mule was a part of his more recent splendour. It was aged seven, and\nit had cost Denry ten pounds. He had bought it off a farmer whose wife\n\"stood\" St Luke's Market. His excuse was that he needed help in getting\nabout the Five Towns in pursuit of cottage rents, for his business of a\nrent-collector had grown. But for this purpose a bicycle would have\nserved equally well, and would not have cost a shilling a day to feed,\nas the mule did, nor have shied at policemen, as the mule nearly always\ndid. Denry had bought the mule simply because he had been struck all of\na sudden with the idea of buying the mule. Some time previously Jos\nCurtenty (the Deputy-Mayor, who became Mayor of Bursley on the Earl of\nChell being called away to govern an Australian colony) had made an\nenormous sensation by buying a flock of geese and driving them home\nhimself. Denry did not like this. He was indeed jealous, if a large mind\ncan be jealous. Jos Curtenty was old enough to be his grandfather, and\nhad been a recognised \"card\" and \"character\" since before Denry's birth.\nBut Denry, though so young, had made immense progress as a card, and\nhad, perhaps justifiably, come to consider himself as the premier card,\nthe very ace, of the town. He felt that some reply was needed to\nCurtenty's geese, and the mule was his reply. It served excellently.\nPeople were soon asking each other whether they had heard that Denry\nMachin's \"latest\" was to buy a mule. He obtained a little old victoria\nfor another ten pounds, and a good set of harness for three guineas. The\ncarriage was low, which enabled him, as he said, to nip in and out much\nmore easily than in and out of a trap. In his business you did almost\nnothing but nip in and out. On the front seat he caused to be fitted a\nnarrow box of japanned tin, with a formidable lock and slits on the top.\nThis box was understood to receive the rents, as he collected them. It\nwas always guarded on journeys by a cross between a mastiff and\nsomething unknown, whose growl would have terrorised a lion-tamer. Denry\nhimself was afraid of Rajah, the dog, but he would not admit it. Rajah\nslept in the stable behind Mrs Machin's cottage, for which Denry paid a\nshilling a week. In the stable there was precisely room for Rajah, the\nmule and the carriage, and when Denry entered to groom or to harness,\nsomething had to go out.\n\nThe equipage quickly grew into a familiar sight in the streets of the\ndistrict. Denry said that it was funny without being vulgar. Certainly\nit amounted to a continual advertisement for him; an infinitely more\neffective advertisement than, for instance, a sandwichman at\neighteen-pence a day, and costing no more, even with the licence and the\nshoeing. Moreover, a sandwichman has this inferiority to a turnout: when\nyou have done with him you cannot put him up to auction and sell him.\nFurther, there are no sandwichmen in the Five Towns; in that democratic\nand independent neighbourhood nobody would deign to be a sandwichman.\n\nThe mulish vehicular display does not end the tale of Denry's splendour.\nHe had an office in St Luke's Square, and in the office was an\noffice-boy, small but genuine, and a real copying-press, and outside it\nwas the little square signboard which in the days of his simplicity used\nto be screwed on to his mother's door. His mother's steely firmness of\ncharacter had driven him into the extravagance of an office. Even after\nhe had made over a thousand pounds out of the Llandudno lifeboat in less\nthan three months, she would not listen to a proposal for going into a\nslightly larger house, of which one room might serve as an office. Nor\nwould she abandon her own labours as a sempstress. She said that since\nher marriage she had always lived in that cottage and had always worked,\nand that she meant to die there, working: and that Denry could do what\nhe chose. He was a bold youth, but not bold enough to dream of quitting\nhis mother; besides, his share of household expenses in the cottage was\nonly ten shillings a week. So he rented the office; and he hired an\noffice-boy, partly to convey to his mother that he _should_ do what\nhe chose, and partly for his own private amusement.\n\nHe was thus, at an age when fellows without imagination are fraying\ntheir cuffs for the enrichment of their elders and glad if they can\nafford a cigar once a month, in possession of a business, business\npremises, a clerical staff, and a private carriage drawn by an animal\nunique in the Five Towns. He was living on less than his income; and in\nthe course of about two years, to a small extent by economies and to a\nlarge extent by injudicious but happy investments, he had doubled the\nLlandudno thousand and won the deference of the manager of the bank at\nthe top of St Luke's Square--one of the most unsentimental men that ever\nwrote \"refer to drawer\" on a cheque.\n\nAnd yet Denry was not satisfied. He had a secret woe, due to the facts\nthat he was gradually ceasing to be a card, and that he was not\nmultiplying his capital by two every six months. He did not understand\nthe money market, nor the stock market, nor even the financial article\nin the _Signal_; but he regarded himself as a financial genius, and\ndeemed that as a financial genius he was vegetating. And as for setting\nthe town on fire, or painting it scarlet, he seemed to have lost the\ntrick of that.\n\n\nII\n\nAnd then one day the populace saw on his office door, beneath his\nname-board, another sign:\n\nFIVE TOWNS UNIVERSAL THRIFT CLUB. _Secretary and Manager_--E.H. MACHIN.\n\nAn idea had visited him.\n\nMany tradesmen formed slate-clubs--goose-clubs, turkey-clubs,\nwhisky-clubs--in the autumn, for Christmas. Their humble customers paid\nso much a week to the tradesmen, who charged them nothing for keeping\nit, and at the end of the agreed period they took out the total sum in\ngoods--dead or alive; eatable, drinkable, or wearable. Denry conceived a\nuniversal slate-club. He meant it to embrace each of the Five Towns. He\nsaw forty thousand industrial families paying weekly instalments into\nhis slate-club. He saw his slate-club entering into contracts with all\nthe principal tradesmen of the entire district, so that the members of\nthe slate-club could shop with slate-club tickets practically where they\nchose. He saw his slate-club so powerful that no tradesman could afford\nnot to be in relations with it. He had induced all Llandudno to perform\nthe same act daily for nearly a whole season, and he now wished to\ninduce all the vast Five Towns to perform the same act to his profit for\nall eternity.\n\nAnd he would be a philanthropist into the bargain. He would encourage\nthrift in the working-man and the working-man's wife. He would guard the\nworking-man's money for him; and to save trouble to the working-man he\nwould call at the working-man's door for the working-man's money.\nFurther, as a special inducement and to prove superior advantages to\nordinary slate-clubs, he would allow the working man to spend his full\nnominal subscription to the club as soon as he had actually paid only\nhalf of it. Thus, after paying ten shillings to Denry, the working-man\ncould spend a pound in Denry's chosen shops, and Denry would settle with\nthe shops at once, while collecting the balance weekly at the\nworking-man's door. But this privilege of anticipation was to be\nforfeited or postponed if the working-man's earlier payments were\nirregular.\n\nAnd Denry would bestow all these wondrous benefits on the working-man\nwithout any charge whatever. Every penny that members paid in, members\nwould draw out. The affair was enormously philanthropic.\n\nDenry's modest remuneration was to come from the shopkeepers upon whom\nhis scheme would shower new custom. They were to allow him at least\ntwopence in the shilling discount on all transactions, which would be\nmore than 16 per cent. on his capital; and he would turn over his\ncapital three times a year. He calculated that out of 50 per cent. per\nannum he would be able to cover working expenses and a little over.\n\nOf course, he had to persuade the shopkeepers. He drove his mule to\nHanbridge and began with Bostocks, the largest but not the most\ndistinguished drapery house in the Five Towns. He succeeded in\nconvincing them on every point except that of his own financial\nstability. Bostocks indicated their opinion that he looked far too much\nlike a boy to be financially stable. His reply was to offer to deposit\nfifty pounds with them before starting business, and to renew the sum in\nadvance as quickly as the members of his club should exhaust it. Cheques\ntalk. He departed with Bostocks' name at the head of his list, and he\nused them as a clinching argument with other shops. But the prejudice\nagainst his youth was strong and general. \"Yes,\" tradesmen would answer,\n\"what you say is all right, but you are so young.\" As if to insinuate\nthat a man must be either a rascal or a fool until he is thirty, just as\nhe must be either a fool or a physician after he is forty. Nevertheless,\nhe had soon compiled a list of several score shops.\n\nHis mother said:\n\n\"Why don't you grow a beard? Here you spend money on razors, strops,\nsoaps and brushes, besides a quarter of an hour of your time every day,\nand cutting yourself--all to keep yourself from having something that\nwould be the greatest help to you in business! With a beard you'd look\nat least thirty-one. Your father had a splendid beard, and so could you\nif you chose.\"\n\nThis was high wisdom. But he would not listen to it. The truth is, he\nwas getting somewhat dandiacal.\n\nAt length his scheme lacked naught but what Denry called a \"right-down\ngood starting shove.\" In a word, a fine advertisement to fire it off.\nNow, he could have had the whole of the first page of the _Signal_\n(at that period) for five-and-twenty pounds. But he had been so\naccustomed to free advertisements of one sort or another that the notion\nof paying for one was loathsome to him. Then it was that he thought of\nthe Countess of Chell, who happened to be staying at Knype. If he could\nobtain that great aristocrat, that ex-Mayoress, that lovely witch, that\nbenefactor of the district, to honour his Thrift Club as patroness,\nsuccess was certain. Everybody in the Five Towns sneered at the Countess\nand called her a busybody; she was even dubbed \"Interfering Iris\" (Iris\nbeing one of her eleven Christian names); the Five Towns was fiercely\ndemocratic--in theory. In practice the Countess was worshipped; her\nsmile was worth at least five pounds, and her invitation to tea was\npriceless. She could not have been more sincerely adulated in the United\nStates, the home of social equality.\n\nDenry said to himself:\n\n\"And why _shouldn't_ I get her name as patroness? I will have her\nname as patroness.\"\n\nHence the expedition to Sneyd Hall, one of the ancestral homes of the\nEarls of Chell.\n\n\nIII\n\nHe had been to Sneyd Hall before many times--like the majority of the\ninhabitants of the Five Towns--for, by the generosity of its owner,\nSneyd Park was always open to the public. To picnic in Sneyd Park was\none of the chief distractions of the Five Towns on Thursday and Saturday\nafternoons. But he had never entered the private gardens. In the midst\nof the private gardens stood the Hall, shut off by immense iron\npalisades, like a lion in a cage at the Zoo. On the autumn afternoon of\nhis Historic visit, Denry passed with qualms through the double gates of\nthe palisade, and began to crunch the gravel of the broad drive that led\nin a straight line to the overwhelming Palladian fa\u00c3\u00a7ade of the Hall.\n\nYes, he was decidedly glad that he had not brought his mule. As he\napproached nearer and nearer to the Countess's front-door his arguments\nin favour of the visit grew more and more ridiculous. Useless to remind\nhimself that he had once danced with the Countess at the municipal ball,\nand amused her to the giggling point, and restored her lost fan to her.\nUseless to remind himself that he was a quite exceptional young man,\nwith a quite exceptional renown, and the equal of any man or woman on\nearth. Useless to remind himself that the Countess was notorious for her\naffability and also for her efforts to encourage the true welfare of the\nFive Towns. The visit was grotesque.\n\nHe ought to have written. He ought, at any rate, to have announced his\nvisit by a note. Yet only an hour earlier he had been arguing that he\ncould most easily capture the Countess by storm, with no warning or\npreparations of any kind.\n\nThen, from a lateral path, a closed carriage and pair drove rapidly up\nto the Hall, and a footman bounced off the hammercloth. Denry could not\nsee through the carriage, but under it he could distinguish the skirts\nof some one who got put of it. Evidently the Countess was just returning\nfrom a drive. He quickened his pace, for at heart he was an audacious\nboy.\n\n\"She can't eat me,\" he said.\n\nThis assertion was absolutely irrefutable, and yet there remained in his\nbold heart an irrational fear that after all she _could_ eat him.\nSuch is the extraordinary influence of a Palladian fa\u00c3\u00a7ade!\n\nAfter what seemed several hours of torture entirely novel in his\nexperience, he skirted the back of the carriage and mounted the steps to\nthe portal. And, although the coachman was innocuous, being apparently\ncarved in stone, Denry would have given a ten-pound note to find himself\nsuddenly in his club or even in church. The masonry of the Hall rose up\nabove him like a precipice. He was searching for the bell-knob in the\nface of the precipice when a lady suddenly appeared at the doors. At\nfirst he thought it was the Countess, and that heart of his began to\nslip down the inside of his legs. But it was not the Countess.\n\n\"Well?\" demanded the lady. She was dressed in black.\n\n\"Can I see the Countess?\" he inquired.\n\nThe lady stared at him. He handed her his professional card which lay\nwaiting all ready in his waistcoat pocket.\n\n\"I will ask my lady,\" said the lady in black.\n\nDenry perceived from her accent that she was not English.\n\nShe disappeared through a swinging door; and then Denry most clearly\nheard the Countess's own authentic voice saying in a pettish, disgusted\ntone:\n\n\"Oh! Bother!\"\n\nAnd he was chilled. He seriously wished that he had never thought of\nstarting his confounded Universal Thrift Club.\n\nAfter some time the carriage suddenly drove off, presumably to the\nstables. As he was now within the hollow of the porch, a sort of cave at\nthe foot of the precipice, he could not see along the length of the\nfa\u00c3\u00a7ade. Nobody came to him. The lady who had promised to ask my lady\nwhether the latter could see him did not return. He reflected that she\nhad not promised to return; she had merely promised to ask a question.\nAs the minutes passed he grew careless, or grew bolder, gradually\ndropping his correct attitude of a man-about-town paying an afternoon\ncall, and peered through the glass of the doors that divided him from\nthe Countess. He could distinguish nothing that had life. One of his\npreliminary tremors had been caused by a fanciful vision of\nmultitudinous footmen, through a double line of whom he would be\ncompelled to walk in order to reach the Countess.\n\nBut there was not even one footman. This complete absence of indoor\nfootmen seemed to him remiss, not in accordance with centuries of\ntradition concerning life at Sneyd.\n\nThen he caught sight, through the doors, of the back of Jock, the\nCountess's carriage footman and the son of his mother's old friend. Jock\nwas standing motionless at a half-open door to the right of the space\nbetween Denry's double doors and the next pair of double doors. Denry\ntried to attract his attention by singular movements and strange noises\nof the mouth. But Jock, like his partner the coachman, appeared to be\ncarven in stone. Denry decided that he would go in and have speech with\nJock. They were on Christian-name terms, or had been a few years ago. He\nunobtrusively pushed at the doors, and at the very same moment Jock,\nwith a start--as though released from some spell--vanished away from the\ndoor to the right.\n\nDenry was now within.\n\n\"Jock!\" He gave a whispering cry, rather conspiratorial in tone. And as\nJock offered no response, he hurried after Jock through the door to the\nright. This door led to a large apartment which struck Denry as being an\nidealisation of a first-class waiting-room at a highly important\nterminal station. In a wall to the left was a small door, half open.\nJock must have gone through that door. Denry hesitated--he had not\nproperly been invited into the Hall. But in hesitating he was wrong; he\nought to have followed his prey without qualms. When he had conquered\nqualms and reached the further door, his eyes were met, to their\namazement, by an immense perspective of great chambers. Denry had once\nseen a Pullman car, which had halted at Knype Station with a French\nactress on board. What he saw now presented itself to him as a train of\nPullman cars, one opening into the other, constructed for giants. Each\ncar was about as large as the large hall in Bursley Town Hall, and, like\nthat auditorium, had a ceiling painted to represent blue sky, milk-white\nclouds, and birds. But in the corners were groups of naked Cupids,\nswimming joyously on the ceiling; in Bursley Town Hall there were no\nnaked Cupids. He understood now that he had been quite wrong in his\nestimate of the room by which he had come into this Versailles. Instead\nof being large it was tiny, and instead of being luxurious it was merely\nfurnished with miscellaneous odds and ends left over from far more\nimportant furnishings. It was indeed naught but a nondescript box of a\nhole insignificantly wedged between the state apartments and the outer\nlobby.\n\nFor an instant he forgot that he was in pursuit of Jock. Jock was\nperfectly invisible and inaudible. He must, however, have gone down the\nvista of the great chambers, and therefore Denry went down the vista of\nthe great chambers after him, curiously expecting to have a glimpse of\nhis long salmon-tinted coat or his cockaded hat popping up out of some\ncorner. He reached the other end of the vista, having traversed three\nenormous chambers, of which the middle one was the most enormous and the\nmost gorgeous. There were high windows everywhere to his right, and to\nhis left, in every chamber, double doors with gilt handles of a peculiar\nshape. Windows and doors, with equal splendour, were draped in hangings\nof brocade. Through the windows he had glimpses of the gardens in their\nautumnal colours, but no glimpse of a gardener. Then a carriage flew\npast the windows at the end of the suite, and he had a very clear though\na transient view of two menials on the box-seat; one of those menials he\nknew must be Jock. Hence Jock must have escaped from the state suite by\none of the numerous doors.\n\nDenry tried one door after another, and they were all fastened firmly on\nthe outside. The gilded handles would turn, but the lofty and ornate\nportals would not yield to pressure. Mystified and startled, he went\nback to the place from which he had begun his explorations, and was even\nmore seriously startled, and more deeply mystified to find nothing but a\nblank wall where he had entered. Obviously he could not have penetrated\nthrough a solid wall. A careful perusal of the wall showed him that\nthere was indeed a door in it, but that the door was artfully disguised\nby painting and other devices so as to look like part of the wall. He\nhad never seen such a phenomenon before. A very small glass knob was the\ndoor's sole fitting. Denry turned this crystal, but with no useful\nresult. In the brief space of time since his entrance, that door, and\nthe door by which Jock had gone, had been secured by unseen hands. Denry\nimagined sinister persons bolting all the multitudinous doors, and\ninimical eyes staring at him through many keyholes. He imagined himself\nto be the victim of some fearful and incomprehensible conspiracy.\n\nWhy, in the sacred name of common-sense, should he have been imprisoned\nin the state suite? The only answer to the conundrum was that nobody was\naware of his quite unauthorised presence in the state suite. But then\nwhy should the state suite be so suddenly locked up, since the Countess\nhad just come in from a drive? It then occurred to him that, instead of\njust coming in, the Countess had been just leaving. The carriage must\nhave driven round from some humbler part of the Hall, with the lady in\nblack in it, and the lady in black--perhaps a lady's-maid--alone had\nstepped out from it. The Countess had been waiting for the carriage in\nthe porch, and had fled to avoid being forced to meet the unfortunate\nDenry. (Humiliating thought!) The carriage had then taken her up at a\nside door. And now she was gone. Possibly she had left Sneyd Hall not to\nreturn for months, and that was why the doors had been locked. Perhaps\neverybody had departed from the Hall save one aged and deaf retainer--he\nknew, from historical novels which he had glanced at in his youth, that\nin every Hall that respected itself an aged and deaf retainer was\ninvariably left solitary during the absences of the noble owner. He\nknocked on the small disguised door. His unique purpose in knocking was\nnaturally to make a noise, but something prevented him from making a\nnoise. He felt that he must knock decently, discreetly; he felt that he\nmust not outrage the conventions.\n\nNo result to this polite summoning.\n\nHe attacked other doors; he attacked every door he could put his hands\non; and gradually he lost his respect for decency and the conventions\nproper to Halls, knocking loudly and more loudly. He banged. Nothing but\nsheer solidity stopped his sturdy hands from going through the panels.\nHe so far forgot himself as to shake the doors with all his strength\nfuriously.\n\nAnd finally he shouted: \"Hi there! Hi! Can't you hear?\"\n\nApparently the aged and deaf retainer could not hear. Apparently he was\nthe deafest retainer that a peeress of the realm ever left in charge of\na princely pile.\n\n\"Well, that's a nice thing!\" Denry exclaimed, and he noticed that he was\nhot and angry. He took a certain pleasure in being angry. He considered\nthat he had a right to be angry.\n\nAt this point he began to work himself up into the state of \"not\ncaring,\" into the state of despising Sneyd Hall, and everything for\nwhich it stood. As for permitting himself to be impressed or intimidated\nby the lonely magnificence of his environment, he laughed at the idea;\nor, more accurately, he snorted at it. Scornfully he tramped up and down\nthose immense interiors, doing the caged lion, and cogitating in quest\nof the right dramatic, effective act to perform in the singular crisis.\nUnhappily, the carpets were very thick, so that though he could tramp,\nhe could not stamp; and he desired to stamp. But in the connecting\ndoorways there were expanses of bare, highly-polished oak floor, and\nhere he did stamp.\n\nThe rooms were not furnished after the manner of ordinary rooms. There\nwas no round or square table in the midst of each, with a checked cloth\non it, and a plant in the centre. Nor in front of each window was there\na small table with a large Bible thereupon. The middle parts of the\nrooms were empty, save for a group of statuary in the largest room.\nGreat arm-chairs and double-ended sofas were ranged about in straight\nlines, and among these, here and there, were smaller chairs gilded from\nhead to foot. Round the walls were placed long narrow tables with tops\nlike glass-cases, and in the cases were all sorts of strange matters--\nsuch as coins, fans, daggers, snuff-boxes. In various corners white\nstatues stood awaiting the day of doom without a rag to protect them\nfrom the winds of destiny. The walls were panelled in tremendous panels,\nand in each panel was a formidable dark oil-painting. The mantelpieces\nwere so preposterously high that not even a giant could have sat at the\nfireplace and put his feet on them. And if they had held clocks, as\nmantelpieces do, a telescope would have been necessary to discern the\nhour. Above each mantelpiece, instead of a looking-glass, was a vast\npicture. The chandeliers were overpowering in glitter and in dimensions.\n\nNear to a sofa Denry saw a pile of yellow linen things. He picked up the\ntopmost article, and it assumed the form of a chair. Yes, these articles\nwere furniture-covers. The Hall, then, was to be shut up. He argued from\nthe furniture-covers that somebody must enter sooner or later to put the\ncovers on the furniture.\n\nThen he did a few more furlongs up and down the vista, and sat down at\nthe far end, under a window. Anyhow, there were always the windows.\n\nHigh though they were from the floor, he could easily open one, spring\nout, and slip unostentatiously away. But he thought he would wait until\ndusk fell. Prudence is seldom misplaced. The windows, however, held a\ndisappointment for him. A mere bar, padlocked, prevented each one of\nthem from being opened; it was a simple device. He would be under the\nnecessity of breaking a plate-glass pane. For this enterprise he thought\nhe would wait until black night. He sat down again. Then he made a fresh\nand noisy assault on all the doors. No result. He sat down a third time,\nand gazed info the gardens where the shadows were creeping darkly. Not a\nsoul in the gardens. Then he felt a draught on the crown of his head,\nand looking aloft he saw that the summit of the window had a transverse\nglazed flap, for ventilation, and that this flap had been left open. If\nhe could have climbed up, he might have fallen out on the other side\ninto the gardens and liberty. But the summit of the window was at least\nsixteen feet from the floor. Night descended.\n\n\nIV\n\nAt a vague hour in the evening a stout woman dressed in black, with a\nblack apron, a neat violet cap on her head, and a small lamp in her\npodgy hand, unlocked one of the doors giving entry to the state rooms.\nShe was on her nightly round of inspection. The autumn moon, nearly at\nfull, had risen and was shining into the great windows. And in front of\nthe furthest window she perceived in the radiance of the moonshine a\npyramidal group, somewhat in the style of a family of acrobats,\ndangerously arranged on the stage of a music-hall. The base of the\npyramid comprised two settees; upon these were several arm-chairs laid\nflat, and on the arm-chairs two tables covered with cushions and rugs;\nlastly, in the way of inanimate nature, two gilt chairs. On the gilt\nchairs was something that unmistakably moved, and was fumbling with the\ntop of the window. Being a stout woman with a tranquil and sagacious\nmind, her first act was not to drop the lamp. She courageously clung to\nthe lamp.\n\n\"Who's there?\" said a voice from the apex of the pyramid.\n\nThen a subsidence began, followed by a crash and a multitudinous\nsplintering of glass. The living form dropped on to one of the settees,\nrebounding like a football from its powerful springs. There was a hole\nas big as a coffin in the window. The living form collected itself, and\nthen jumped wildly through that hole into the gardens.\n\nDenry ran. The moment had not struck him as a moment propitious for\nexplanation. In a flash he had seen the ridiculousness of endeavouring\nto convince a stout lady in black that he was a gentleman paying a call\non the Countess. He simply scrambled to his legs and ran. He ran\naimlessly in the darkness and sprawled over a hedge, after crossing\nvarious flower-beds. Then he saw the sheen of the moon on Sneyd Lake,\nand he could take his bearings. In winter all the Five Towns skate on\nSneyd Lake if the ice will bear, and the geography of it was quite\nfamiliar to Denry. He skirted its east bank, plunged into Great Shendon\nWood, and emerged near Great Shendon Station, on the line from Stafford\nto Knype. He inquired for the next train in the tones of innocency, and\nin half an hour was passing through Sneyd Station itself. In another\nfifty minutes he was at home. The clock showed ten-fifteen. His mother's\ncottage seemed amazingly small. He said that he had been detained in\nHanbridge on business, that he had had neither tea nor supper, and that\nhe was hungry. Next morning he could scarcely be sure that his visit to\nSneyd Hall was not a dream. In any event, it had been a complete\nfailure.\n\n\nV\n\nIt was on this untriumphant morning that one of the tenants under his\ncontrol, calling at the cottage to pay some rent overdue, asked him when\nthe Universal Thrift Club was going to commence its operations. He had\ntalked of the enterprise to all his tenants, for it was precisely with\nhis tenants that he hoped to make a beginning. He had there a\n_client\u00c3\u00a8le_ ready to his hand, and as he was intimately acquainted\nwith the circumstances of each, he could judge between those who would\nbe reliable and those to whom he would be obliged to refuse membership.\nThe tenants, conclaving together of an evening on doorsteps, had come to\nthe conclusion that the Universal Thrift Club was the very contrivance\nwhich they had lacked for years. They saw in it a cure for all their\neconomic ills, and the gate to Paradise. The dame who put the question\nto him on the morning after his defeat wanted to be the possessor of\ncarpets, a new teapot, a silver brooch, and a cookery book; and she was\nevidently depending upon Denry. On consideration he saw no reason why\nthe Universal Thrift Club should not be allowed to start itself by the\nimpetus of its own intrinsic excellence. The dame was inscribed for\nthree shares, paid eighteen-pence entrance fee, undertook to pay three\nshillings a week, and received a document entitling her to spend \u00c2\u00a33,\n18s. in sixty-five shops as soon as she had paid \u00c2\u00a31, 19s. to Denry. It\nwas a marvellous scheme. The rumour of it spread; before dinner Denry\nhad visits from other aspirants to membership, and he had posted a\ncheque to Bostocks', but more from ostentation than necessity; for no\nmember could possibly go into Bostocks' with his coupons until at least\ntwo months had elapsed.\n\nBut immediately after dinner, when the posters of the early edition of\nthe _Signal_ waved in the streets, he had material for other\nthought. He saw a poster as he was walking across to his office. The\nawful legend ran:\n\n  ASTOUNDING ATTEMPTED BURGLARY AT SNEYD HALL.\n\nIn buying the paper he was afflicted with a kind of ague. And the\ndescription of events at Sneyd Hall was enough to give ague to a negro.\nThe account had been taken from the lips of Mrs Gater, housekeeper at\nSneyd Hall. She had related to a reporter how, upon going into the state\nsuite before retiring for the night, she had surprised a burglar of\nHerculean physique and Titanic proportions. Fortunately she knew her\nduty, and did not blench. The burglar had threatened her with a\nrevolver, and then, finding such bluff futile, had deliberately jumped\nthrough a large plate-glass window and vanished. Mrs Gater could not\nconceive how the fellow had \"effected an entrance.\" (According to the\nreporter, Mrs Gater said \"effected an entrance,\" not \"got in.\" And here\nit may be mentioned that in the columns of the _Signal_ burglars\nnever get into a residence; without exception they invariably effect an\nentrance.) Mrs Gater explained further how the plans of the burglar must\nhave been laid with the most diabolic skill; how he must have studied\nthe daily life of the Hall patiently for weeks, if not months; how he\nmust have known the habits and plans of every soul in the place, and the\nexact instant at which the Countess had arranged to drive to Stafford to\ncatch the London express.\n\nIt appeared that save for four maidservants, a page, two dogs, three\ngardeners, and the kitchen-clerk, Mrs Gater was alone in the Hall.\nDuring the late afternoon and early evening they had all been to assist\nat a rat-catching in the stables, and the burglar must have been aware\nof this. It passed Mrs Gater's comprehension how the criminal had got\nclear away out of the gardens and park, for to set up a hue and cry had\nbeen with her the work of a moment. She could not be sure whether he had\ntaken any valuable property, but the inventory was being checked. Though\nsurely for her an inventory was scarcely necessary, as she had been\nhousekeeper at Sneyd Hall for six-and-twenty years, and might be said to\nknow the entire contents of the mansion by heart! The police were at\nwork. They had studied footprints and _d\u00c3\u00a9bris_. There was talk of\nobtaining detectives from London. Up to the time of going to press, no\nclue had been discovered, but Mrs Gater was confident that a clue would\nbe discovered, and of her ability to recognise the burglar when he\nshould be caught. His features, as seen in the moonlight, were imprinted\non her mind for ever. He was a young man, well dressed. The Earl had\ntelegraphed, offering a reward of \u00c2\u00a320 for the fellow's capture. A\nwarrant was out.\n\nSo it ran on.\n\nDenry saw clearly all the errors of tact which he had committed on the\nprevious day. He ought not to have entered uninvited. But having\nentered, he ought to have held firm in quiet dignity until the\nhousekeeper came, and then he ought to have gone into full details with\nthe housekeeper, producing his credentials and showing her unmistakably\nthat he was offended by the experience which somebody's gross\ncarelessness had forced upon him.\n\nInstead of all that, he had behaved with simple stupidity, and the\nresult was that a price was upon his head. Far from acquiring moral\nimpressiveness and influential aid by his journey to Sneyd Hall, he had\nutterly ruined himself as a founder of a Universal Thrift Club. You\ncannot conduct a thrift club from prison, and a sentence of ten years\ndoes not inspire confidence in the ignorant mob. He trembled at the\nthought of what would happen when the police learned from the Countess\nthat a man with a card on which was the name of Machin had called at\nSneyd just before her departure.\n\nHowever, the police never did learn this from the Countess (who had gone\nto Rome for the autumn). It appeared that her maid had merely said to\nthe Countess that \"a man\" had called, and also that the maid had lost\nthe card. Careful research showed that the burglar had been disturbed\nbefore he had had opportunity to burgle. And the affair, after raising a\nterrific bother in the district, died down.\n\nThen it was that an article appeared in the _Signal_, signed by\nDenry, and giving a full picturesque description of the state apartments\nat Sneyd Hall. He had formed a habit of occasional contributions to the\n_Signal_. This article began:--\n\n  \"The recent sensational burglary at Sneyd Hall has drawn attention to\n  the magnificent state apartments of that unique mansion. As very few\n  but the personal friends of the family are allowed a glimpse of these\n  historic rooms, they being of course quite closed to the public, we\n  have thought that some account of them might interest the readers of\n  the _Signal_. On the occasion of our last visit...,\" etc.\n\nHe left out nothing of their splendour.\n\nThe article was quoted as far as Birmingham in the Midlands Press.\nPeople recalled Denry's famous waltz with the Countess at the memorable\ndance in Bursley Town Hall. And they were bound to assume that the\nrelations thus begun had been more or less maintained. They were struck\nby Denry's amazing discreet self-denial in never boasting of them. Denry\nrose in the market of popular esteem. Talking of Denry, people talked of\nthe Universal Thrift Club, which went quietly ahead, and they admitted\nthat Denry was of the stuff which succeeds and deserves to succeed.\n\nBut only Denry himself could appreciate fully how great Denry was, to\nhave snatched such a wondrous victory out of such a humiliating defeat!\n\nHis chin slowly disappeared from view under a quite presentable beard.\nBut whether the beard was encouraged out of respect for his mother's\nsage advice, or with the object of putting the housekeeper of Sneyd Hall\noff the scent, if she should chance to meet Denry, who shall say?\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nTHE RESCUER OF DAMES\n\n\nI\n\nIt next happened that Denry began to suffer from the ravages of a malady\nwhich is almost worse than failure--namely, a surfeit of success. The\nsuccess was that of his Universal Thrift Club. This device, by which\nmembers after subscribing one pound in weekly instalments could at once\nget two pounds' worth of goods at nearly any large shop in the district,\nappealed with enormous force to the democracy of the Five Towns. There\nwas no need whatever for Denry to spend money on advertising. The first\nmembers of the club did all the advertising and made no charge for doing\nit. A stream of people anxious to deposit money with Denry in exchange\nfor a card never ceased to flow Into his little office in St Luke's\nSquare. The stream, indeed, constantly thickened. It was a wonderful\ninvention, the Universal Thrift Club. And Denry ought to have been\nhappy, especially as his beard was growing strongly and evenly, and\ngiving him the desired air of a man of wisdom and stability. But he was\nnot happy. And the reason was that the popularity of the Thrift Club\nnecessitated much book-keeping, which he hated.\n\nHe was an adventurer, in the old honest sense, and no clerk. And he\nfound himself obliged not merely to buy large books of account, but to\nfill them with figures; and to do addition sums from page to page; and\nto fill up hundreds of cards; and to write out lists of shops, and to\nhave long interviews with printers whose proofs made him dream of\nlunatic asylums; and to reckon innumerable piles of small coins; and to\nassist his small office-boy in the great task of licking envelopes and\nstamps. Moreover, he was worried by shopkeepers; every shopkeeper in the\ndistrict now wanted to allow him twopence in the shilling on the\npurchases of club members. And he had to collect all the subscriptions,\nin addition to his rents; and also to make personal preliminary\ninquiries as to the reputation of intending members. If he could have\nrisen every day at 4 A.M. and stayed up working every night till 4 A.M.\nhe might have got through most of the labour. He did, as a fact, come\nvery near to this ideal. So near that one morning his mother said to\nhim, at her driest:\n\n\"I suppose I may as well sell your bedstead. Denry?\"\n\nAnd there was no hope of improvement; instead of decreasing, the work\nmultiplied.\n\nWhat saved him was the fortunate death of Lawyer Lawton. The aged\nsolicitor's death put the town into mourning and hung the church with\nblack. But Denry as a citizen bravely bore the blow because he was able\nto secure the services of Penkethman, Lawyer Lawton's eldest clerk, who,\nafter keeping the Lawton books and writing the Lawton letters for\nthirty-five years, was dismissed by young Lawton for being over fifty\nand behind the times. The desiccated bachelor was grateful to Denry. He\ncalled Denry \"Sir,\" or rather he called Denry's suit of clothes \"Sir,\"\nfor he had a vast respect for a well-cut suit. On the other hand, he\nmaltreated the little office-boy, for he had always been accustomed to\nmaltreating little office-boys, not seriously, but just enough to give\nthem an interest in life. Penkethman enjoyed desks, ledgers, pens, ink,\nrulers, and blotting-paper. He could run from bottom to top of a column\nof figures more quickly than the fire-engine could run up Oldcastle\nStreet; and his totals were never wrong. His gesture with a piece of\nblotting-paper as he blotted off a total was magnificent. He liked long\nhours; he was thoroughly used to overtime, and his boredom in his\nlodgings was such that he would often arrive at the office before the\nappointed hour. He asked thirty shillings a week, and Denry in a mood of\ngenerosity gave him thirty-one. He gave Denry his whole life, and put a\nmeticulous order into the establishment. Denry secretly thought him a\nmiracle, but up at the club at Porthill he was content to call him \"the\nhuman machine.\" \"I wind him up every Saturday night with a sovereign,\nhalf a sovereign, and a shilling,\" said Denry, \"and he goes for a week.\nCompensated balance adjusted for all temperatures. No escapement.\nJewelled in every hole. Ticks in any position. Made in England.\"\n\nThis jocularity of Denry's was a symptom that Denry's spirits were\nrising. The bearded youth was seen oftener in the streets behind his\nmule and his dog. The adventurer had, indeed, taken to the road again.\nAfter an emaciating period he began once more to stouten. He was the\nimage of success. He was the picturesque card, whom everybody knew and\neverybody had pleasure in greeting.\n\nIn some sort he was rather like the flag on the Town Hall.\n\nAnd then a graver misfortune threatened.\n\nIt arose out of the fact that, though Denry was a financial genius, he\nwas in no sense qualified to be a Fellow of the Institute of Chartered\nAccountants. The notion that an excess of prosperity may bring ruin had\nnever presented itself to him, until one day he discovered that out of\nover two thousand pounds there remained less than six hundred to his\ncredit at the bank. This was at the stage of the Thrift Club when the\nfounder of the Thrift Club was bound under the rules to give credit.\nWhen the original lady member had paid in her two pounds or so, she was\nentitled to spend four pounds or so at shops. She did spend four pounds\nor so at shops. And Denry had to pay the shops. He was thus temporarily\nnearly two pounds out of pocket, and he had to collect that sum by\ntrifling instalments. Multiply this case by five hundred, and you will\nunderstand the drain on Denry's capital. Multiply it by a thousand, and\nyou will understand the very serious peril which overhung Denry.\nMultiply it by fifteen hundred and you will understand that Denry had\nbeen culpably silly to inaugurate a mighty scheme like the Universal\nThrift Club on a paltry capital of two thousand pounds. He had. In his\nsimplicity he had regarded two thousand pounds as boundless wealth.\n\nAlthough new subscriptions poured in, the drain grew more distressing.\nYet he could not persuade himself to refuse new members. He stiffened\nhis rules, and compelled members to pay at his office instead of on\ntheir own doorsteps; he instituted fines for irregularity. But nothing\ncould stop the progress of the Universal Thrift Club. And disaster\napproached. Denry felt as though he were being pushed nearer and nearer\nto the edge of a precipice by a tremendous multitude of people. At\nlength, very much against his inclination, he put up a card in his\nwindow that no new members could be accepted until further notice,\npending the acquisition of larger offices and other arrangements. For\nthe shrewd, it was a confession of failure, and he knew it.\n\nThen the rumour began to form, and to thicken, and to spread, that\nDenry's famous Universal Thrift Club was unsound at the core, and that\nthe teeth of those who had bitten the apple would be set on edge.\n\nAnd Denry saw that something great, something decisive, must be done and\ndone with rapidity.\n\n\nII\n\nHis thoughts turned to the Countess of Chell. The original attempt to\nengage her moral support in aid of the Thrift Club had ended in a\ndangerous fiasco. Denry had been beaten by circumstances. And though he\nhad emerged from the defeat with credit, he had no taste for defeat. He\ndisliked defeat even when it was served with jam. And his indomitable\nthoughts turned to the Countess again. He put it to himself in this way,\nscratching his head:\n\n\"I've got to get hold of that woman, and that's all about it!\"\n\nThe Countess at this period was busying herself with the policemen of\nthe Five Towns. In her exhaustless passion for philanthropy, bazaars,\nand platforms, she had already dealt with orphans, the aged, the blind,\npotter's asthma, cr\u00c3\u00a8ches, churches, chapels, schools, economic cookery,\nthe smoke-nuisance, country holidays, Christmas puddings and blankets,\nhealthy musical entertainments, and barmaids. The excellent and\nbeautiful creature was suffering from a dearth of subjects when the\npolicemen occurred to her. She made the benevolent discovery that\npolicemen were over-worked, underpaid, courteous and trustworthy public\nservants, and that our lives depended on them. And from this discovery\nit naturally followed that policemen deserved her energetic assistance.\nWhich assistance resulted in the erection of a Policemen's Institute at\nHanbridge, the chief of the Five Towns. At the Institute policemen would\nbe able to play at draughts, read the papers, and drink everything\nnon-alcoholic at prices that defied competition. And the Institute also\nconferred other benefits on those whom all the five Mayors of the Five\nTowns fell into the way of describing as \"the stalwart guardians of the\nlaw.\" The Institute, having been built, had to be opened with due\nsplendour and ceremony. And naturally the Countess of Chell was the\nperson to open it, since without her it would never have existed.\n\nThe solemn day was a day in March, and the hour was fixed for three\no'clock, and the place was the large hall of the Institute itself,\nbehind Crown Square, which is the Trafalgar Square of Hanbridge. The\nCountess was to drive over from Sneyd. Had the epoch been ten years\nlater she would have motored over. But probably that would not have made\nany difference to what happened.\n\nIn relating what did happen, I confine myself to facts, eschewing\nimputations. It is a truism that life is full of coincidences, but\nwhether these events comprised a coincidence, or not, each reader must\ndecide for himself, according to his cynicism or his faith in human\nnature.\n\nThe facts are: First, that Denry called one day at the house of Mrs Kemp\na little lower down Brougham Street, Mrs Kemp being friendly with Mrs\nMachin, and the mother of Jock, the Countess's carriage-footman, whom\nDenry had known from boyhood. Second, that a few days later, when Jock\ncame over to see his mother, Denry was present, and that subsequently\nDenry and Jock went for a stroll together in the cemetery, the principal\nresort of strollers in Bursley. Third, that on the afternoon of the\nopening ceremony the Countess's carriage broke down in Sneyd Vale, two\nmiles from Sneyd and three miles from Hanbridge. Fourth, that five\nminutes later Denry, all in his best clothes, drove up behind his mule.\nFifth, that Denry drove right past the breakdown, apparently not\nnoticing it. Sixth, that Jock, touching his hat to Denry as if to a\nstranger (for, of course, while on duty a footman must be dead to all\nhumanities), said:\n\n\"Excuse me, sir,\" and so caused Denry to stop.\n\nThese are the simple facts.\n\nDenry looked round with that careless half-turn of the upper part of the\nbody which drivers of elegant equipages affect when their attention is\ncalled to something trifling behind them. The mule also looked round--it\nwas a habit of the mule's--and if the dog had been there the dog would\nhave shown an even livelier inquisitiveness; but Denry had left the\nfaithful animal at home.\n\n\"Good-afternoon, Countess,\" he said, raising his hat, and trying to\nexpress surprise, pleasure, and imperturbability all at once.\n\nThe Countess of Chell, who was standing in the road, raised her lorgnon,\nwhich was attached to the end of a tortoiseshell pole about a foot long,\nand regarded Denry. This lorgnon was a new device of hers, and it was\nalready having the happy effect of increasing the sale of long-handled\nlorgnons throughout the Five Towns.\n\n\"Oh! it's you, is it?\" said the Countess. \"I see you've grown a beard.\"\n\nIt was just this easy familiarity that endeared her to the district. As\nobservant people put it, you never knew what she would say next, and yet\nshe never compromised her dignity.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Denry. \"Have you had an accident?\"\n\n\"No,\" said the Countess, bitterly: \"I'm doing this for idle amusement.\"\n\nThe horses had been taken out, and were grazing by the roadside like\ncommon horses. The coachman was dipping his skirts in the mud as he bent\ndown in front of the carriage and twisted the pole to and fro and round\nabout and round about. The footman, Jock, was industriously watching\nhim.\n\n\"It's the pole-pin, sir,\" said Jock.\n\nDenry descended from his own hammercloth. The Countess was not smiling.\nIt was the first time that Denry had ever seen her without an efficient\nsmile on her face.\n\n\"Have you got to be anywhere particular?\" he asked. Many ladies would\nnot have understood what he meant. But the Countess was used to the Five\nTowns.\n\n\"Yes,\" said she. \"I have got to be somewhere particular. I've got to be\nat the Police Institute at three o'clock particular, Mr Machin. And I\nshan't be. I'm late now. We've been here ten minutes.\"\n\nThe Countess was rather too often late for public ceremonies. Nobody\ninformed her of the fact. Everybody, on the contrary, assiduously\npretended that she had arrived to the very second. But she was well\naware that she had a reputation for unpunctuality. Ordinarily, being too\nhurried to invent a really clever excuse, she would assert lightly that\nsomething had happened to her carriage. And now something in truth had\nhappened to her carriage--but who would believe it at the Police\nInstitute?\n\n\"If you'll come with me I'll guarantee to get you there by three\no'clock,\" said Denry.\n\nThe road thereabouts was lonely. A canal ran parallel with it at a\ndistance of fifty yards, and on the canal a boat was moving in the\ndirection of Hanbridge at the rate of a mile an hour. Such was the only\nother vehicle in sight. The outskirts of Knype, the nearest town, did\nnot begin until at least a mile further on; and the Countess, dressed\nfor the undoing of mayors and other unimpressionable functionaries,\ncould not possibly have walked even half a mile in that rich dark mud.\nShe thanked him, and without a word to her servants took the seat beside\nhim.\n\n\nIII\n\nImmediately the mule began to trot the Countess began to smile again.\nRelief and content were painted upon her handsome features. Denry soon\nlearnt that she knew all about mules--or almost all. She told him how\nshe had ridden hundreds of miles on mules in the Apennines, where there\nwere no roads, and only mules, goats and flies could keep their feet on\nthe steep, stony paths. She said that a good mule was worth forty pounds\nin the Apennines, more than a horse of similar quality. In fact, she was\nvery sympathetic about mules. Denry saw that he must drive with as much\nstyle as possible, and he tried to remember all that he had picked up\nfrom a book concerning the proper manner of holding the reins. For in\neverything that appertained to riding and driving the Countess was an\nexpert. In the season she hunted once or twice a week with the North\nStaffordshire Hounds, and the _Signal_ had stated that she was a\nfearless horsewoman. It made this statement one day when she had been\nthrown and carried to Sneyd senseless.\n\nThe mule, too, seemingly conscious of its responsibilities and its high\ndestiny, put its best foot foremost and behaved in general like a mule\nthat knew the name of its great-grandfather. It went through Knype in\nadmirable style, not swerving at the steam-cars nor exciting itself\nabout the railway bridge. A photographer who stood at his door\nmanoeuvring a large camera startled it momentarily, until it remembered\nthat it had seen a camera before. The Countess, who wondered why on\nearth a photographer should be capering round a tripod in a doorway,\nturned to inspect the man with her lorgnon.\n\nThey were now coursing up the Cauldon Bank towards Hanbridge. They were\nalready within the boundaries of Hanbridge, and a pedestrian here and\nthere recognised the Countess. You can hide nothing from the quidnunc of\nHanbridge. Moreover, when a quidnunc in the streets of Hanbridge sees\nsomebody famous or striking, or notorious, he does not pretend that he\nhas seen nobody. He points unmistakably to what he has observed, if he\nhas a companion, and if he has no companion he stands still and stares\nwith such honest intensity that the entire street stands and stares too.\nOccasionally you may see an entire street standing and staring without\nany idea of what it is staring at. As the equipage dashingly approached\nthe busy centre of Hanbridge, the region of fine shops, public-houses,\nhotels, halls, and theatres, more and more of the inhabitants knew that\nIris (as they affectionately called her) was driving with a young man in\na tumble-down little victoria behind a mule whose ears flapped like an\nelephant's. Denry being far less renowned in Hanbridge than in his\nnative Bursley, few persons recognised him. After the victoria had gone\nby people who had heard the news too late rushed from shops and gazed at\nthe Countess's back as at a fading dream until the insistent clang of a\ncar-bell made them jump again to the footpath.\n\nAt length Denry and the Countess could see the clock of the Old Town\nHall in Crown Square and it was a minute to three. They were less than a\nminute off the Institute.\n\n\"There you are!\" said Denry, proudly. \"Three miles if it's a yard, in\nseventeen minutes. For a mule it's none so dusty.\"\n\nAnd such was the Countess's knowledge of the language of the Five Towns\nthat she instantly divined the meaning of even that phrase, \"none so\ndusty.\"\n\nThey swept into Crown Square grandly.\n\nAnd then, with no warning, the mule suddenly applied all the automatic\nbrakes which a mule has, and stopped.\n\n\"Oh Lor!\" sighed Denry. He knew the cause of that arresting.\n\nA large squad of policemen, a perfect regiment of policemen, was moving\nacross the north side of the square in the direction of the Institute.\nNothing could have seemed more reassuring, less harmful, than that band\nof policemen, off duty for the afternoon and collected together for the\npurpose of giving a hearty and policemanly welcome to their benefactress\nthe Countess. But the mule had his own views about policemen. In the\nearly days of Denry's ownership of him he had nearly always shied at the\nspectacle of a policemen. He would tolerate steam-rollers, and even\nfalling kites, but a policeman had ever been antipathetic to him. Denry,\nby patience and punishment, had gradually brought him round almost to\nthe Countess's views of policemen--namely, that they were a courteous\nand trustworthy body of public servants, not to be treated as scarecrows\nor the dregs of society. At any rate, the mule had of late months\npractically ceased to set his face against the policing of the Five\nTowns. And when he was on his best behaviour he would ignore a policeman\ncompletely.\n\nBut there were several hundreds of policemen in that squad, the majority\nof all the policemen in the Five Towns. And clearly the mule considered\nthat Denry, in confronting him with several hundred policemen\nsimultaneously, had been presuming upon his good-nature.\n\nThe mule's ears were saying agitatedly:\n\n\"A line must be drawn somewhere, and I have drawn it where my forefeet\nnow are.\"\n\nThe mule's ears soon drew together a little crowd.\n\nIt occurred to Denry that if mules were so wonderful in the Apennines\nthe reason must be that there are no policemen in the Apennines. It also\noccurred to him that something must be done to this mule.\n\n\"Well?\" said the Countess, inquiringly.\n\nIt was a challenge to him to prove that he and not the mule was in\ncharge of the expedition.\n\nHe briefly explained the mule's idiosyncrasy, as it were apologising for\nits bad taste in objecting to public servants whom the Countess\ncherished.\n\n\"They'll be out of sight in a moment,\" said the Countess. And both she\nand Denry tried to look as if the victoria had stopped in that special\nspot for a special reason, and that the mule was a pattern of obedience.\nNevertheless, the little crowd was growing a little larger.\n\n\"Now,\" said the Countess, encouragingly. The tail of the regiment of\npolicemen had vanished towards the Institute.\n\n\"Tchk! Tchk!\" Denry persuaded the mule.\n\nNo response from those forefeet!\n\n\"Perhaps I'd better get out and walk,\" the Countess suggested. The crowd\nwas becoming inconvenient, and had even begun to offer unsolicited hints\nas to the proper management of mules. The crowd was also saying to\nitself: \"It's her! It's her! It's her!\" Meaning that it was the\nCountess.\n\n\"Oh no,\" said Denry, \"it's all right.\"\n\nAnd he caught the mule \"one\" over the head with his whip.\n\nThe mule, stung into action, dashed away, and the crowd scattered as if\nblown to pieces by the explosion of a bomb. Instead of pursuing a right\nline the mule turned within a radius of its own length, swinging the\nvictoria round after it as though the victoria had been a kettle\nattached to it with string. And Countess, Denry, and victoria were rapt\nwith miraculous swiftness away--not at all towards the Policemen's\nInstitute, but down Longshaw Road, which is tolerably steep. They were\npursued, but ineffectually. For the mule had bolted and was winged. They\nfortunately came into contact with nothing except a large barrow of\ncarrots, turnips, and cabbages which an old woman was wheeling up\nLongshaw Road. The concussion upset the barrow, half filled the victoria\nwith vegetables, and for a second stayed the mule; but no real harm\nseemed to have been done, and the mule proceeded with vigour. Then the\nCountess noticed that Denry was not using his right arm, which swung\nabout rather uselessly.\n\n\"I must have knocked my elbow against the barrow,\" he muttered. His face\nwas pale.\n\n\"Give me the reins,\" said the Countess.\n\n\"I think I can turn the brute up here,\" he said.\n\nAnd he did in fact neatly divert the mule up Birches Street, which is\nsteeper even than Longshaw Road. The mule for a few instants pretended\nthat all gradients, up or down, were equal before its angry might. But\nBirches Street has the slope of a house-roof. Presently the mule walked,\nand then it stood still. And half Birches Street emerged to gaze, for\nthe Countess's attire was really very splendid.\n\n\"I'll leave this here, and we'll walk back,\" said Denry. \"You won't be\nlate--that is, nothing to speak of. The Institute is just round the top\nhere.\"\n\n\"You don't mean to say you're going to let that mule beat you?\"\nexclaimed the Countess.\n\n\"I was only thinking of your being late.\"\n\n\"Oh, bother!\" said she. \"Your mule may be ruined.\" The horse-trainer in\nher was aroused.\n\n\"And then my arm?\" said Denry.\n\n\"Shall I drive back?\" the Countess suggested.\n\n\"Oh, do,\" said Denry. \"Keep on up the street, and then to the left.\"\n\nThey changed places, and two minutes later she brought the mule to an\nobedient rest in front of the Police Institute, which was all newly red\nwith terra-cotta. The main body of policemen had passed into the\nbuilding, but two remained at the door, and the mule haughtily tolerated\nthem. The Countess despatched one to Longshaw Road to settle with the\nold woman whose vegetables they had brought away with them. The other\npoliceman, who, owing to the Countess's philanthropic energy, had\nreceived a course of instruction in first aid, arranged a sling for\nDenry's arm. And then the Countess said that Denry ought certainly to go\nwith her to the inauguration ceremony. The policeman whistled a boy to\nhold the mule. Denry picked a carrot out of the complex folds of the\nCountess's rich costume. And the Countess and her saviour entered the\nportico and were therein met by an imposing group of important male\npersonages, several of whom wore mayoral chains. Strange tales of what\nhad happened to the Countess had already flown up to the Institute, and\nthe chief expression on the faces of the group seemed to be one of\nastonishment that she still lived.\n\n\nIV\n\nDenry observed that the Countess was now a different woman. She had\nsuddenly put on a manner to match her costume, which in certain parts\nwas stiff with embroidery. From the informal companion and the tamer of\nmules she had miraculously developed into the public celebrity, the\npeeress of the realm, and the inaugurator-general of philanthropic\nschemes and buildings. Not one of the important male personages but\nwould have looked down on Denry!\n\nAnd yet, while treating Denry as a jolly equal, the Countess with all\nher embroidered and stiff politeness somehow looked down on the\nimportant male personages--and they knew it. And the most curious thing\nwas that they seemed rather to enjoy it. The one who seemed to enjoy it\nthe least was Sir Jehoshophat Dain, a white-bearded pillar of terrific\nimposingness.\n\nSir Jee--as he was then beginning to be called--had recently been\nknighted, by way of reward for his enormous benefactions to the\ncommunity. In the _r\u00c3\u00b4le_ of philanthropist he was really much more\neffective than the Countess. But he was not young, he was not pretty, he\nwas not a woman, and his family had not helped to rule England for\ngenerations--at any rate, so far as anybody knew. He had made more money\nthan had ever before been made by a single brain in the manufacture of\nearthenware, and he had given more money to public causes than a single\npocket had ever before given in the Five Towns. He had never sought\nmunicipal honours, considering himself to be somewhat above such\ntrifles. He was the first purely local man to be knighted in the Five\nTowns. Even before the bestowal of the knighthood his sense of humour\nhad been deficient, and immediately afterwards it had vanished entirely.\nIndeed, he did not miss it. He divided the population of the kingdom\ninto two classes--the titled and the untitled. With Sir Jee, either you\nwere titled, or you weren't. He lumped all the untitled together; and to\nbe just to his logical faculty, he lumped all the titled together. There\nwere various titles--Sir Jee admitted that--but a title was a title, and\ntherefore all titles were practically equal. The Duke of Norfolk was one\ntitled individual, and Sir Jee was another. The fine difference between\nthem might be perceptible to the titled, and might properly be\nrecognised by the titled when the titled were among themselves, but for\nthe untitled such a difference ought not to exist and could not exist.\n\nThus for Sir Jee there were two titled beings in the group--the Countess\nand himself. The Countess and himself formed one caste in the group, and\nthe rest another caste. And although the Countess, in her punctilious\ndemeanour towards him, gave due emphasis to his title (he returning more\nthan due emphasis to hers), he was not precisely pleased by the\nundertones of suave condescension that characterised her greeting of him\nas well as her greeting of the others. Moreover, he had known Denry as a\nclerk of Mr Duncalf's, for Mr Duncalf had done a lot of legal work\nfor him in the past. He looked upon Denry as an upstart, a capering\nmountebank, and he strongly resented Denry's familiarity with the\nCountess. He further resented Denry's sling, which gave to Denry an\ninteresting romantic aspect (despite his beard), and he more than all\nresented that Denry should have rescued the Countess from a carriage\naccident by means of his preposterous mule. Whenever the Countess, in\nthe preliminary chatter, referred to Denry or looked at Denry, in\nrecounting the history of her adventures, Sir Jee's soul squirmed, and\nhis body sympathised with his soul. Something in him that was more\npowerful than himself compelled him to do his utmost to reduce Denry to\na moral pulp, to flatten him, to ignore him, or to exterminate him by\nthe application of ice. This tactic was no more lost on the Countess\nthan it was on Denry. And the Countess foiled it at every instant. In\ntruth, there existed between the Countess and Sir Jee a rather hot\nrivalry in philanthropy and the cultivation of the higher welfare of the\ndistrict. He regarded himself, and she regarded herself, as the most\nbrightly glittering star of the Five Towns.\n\nWhen the Countess had finished the recital of her journey, and the faces\nof the group had gone through all the contortions proper to express\nterror, amazement, admiration, and manly sympathy, Sir Jee took the\nlead, coughed, and said in his elaborate style:\n\n\"Before we adjourn to the hall, will not your ladyship take a little\nrefreshment?\"\n\n\"Oh no, thanks,\" said the Countess. \"I'm not a bit upset.\" Then she\nturned to the enslinged Denry and with concern added: \"But will\n_you_ have something?\"\n\nIf she could have foreseen the consequences of her question, she might\nnever have put it. Still, she might have put it just the same.\n\nDenry paused an instant, and an old habit rose up in him.\n\n\"Oh no, thanks,\" he said, and turning deliberately to Sir Jee, he added:\n\"Will _you_?\"\n\nThis, of course, was mere crude insolence to the titled philanthropic\nwhite-beard. But it was by no means the worst of Denry's behaviour. The\ngroup--every member of the group--distinctly perceived a movement of\nDenry's left hand towards Sir Jee. It was the very slightest movement, a\nwavering, a nothing. It would have had no significance whatever, but for\none fact. Denry's left hand still held the carrot.\n\nEverybody exhibited the most marvellous self-control. And everybody\nexcept Sir Jee was secretly charmed, for Sir Jee had never inspired\nlove. It is remarkable how local philanthropists are unloved, locally.\nThe Countess, without blenching, gave the signal for what Sir Jee called\nthe \"adjournment\" to the hall. Nothing might have happened, yet\neverything had happened.\n\n\nV\n\nNext, Denry found himself seated on the temporary platform which had\nbeen erected in the large games hall of the Policemen's Institute.\n\nThe Mayor of Hanbridge was in the chair, and he had the Countess on his\nright and the Mayoress of Bursley on his left. Other mayoral chains\nblazed in the centre of the platform, together with fine hats of\nmayoresses and uniforms of police-superintendents and captains of\nfire-brigades. Denry's sling also contributed to the effectiveness; he\nwas placed behind the Countess. Policemen (looking strange without\nhelmets) and their wives, sweethearts, and friends, filled the hall to\nits fullest; enthusiasm was rife and strident; and there was only one\nlittle sign that the untoward had occurred. That little sign was an\nempty chair in the first row near the Countess. Sir Jee, a prey to a\nsudden indisposition, had departed. He had somehow faded away, while the\npersonages were climbing the stairs. He had faded away amid the\nexpressed regrets of those few who by chance saw him in the act of\nfading. But even these bore up manfully. The high humour of the\ngathering was not eclipsed.\n\nTowards the end of the ceremony came the votes of thanks, and the\nprincipal of these was the vote of thanks to the Countess, prime cause\nof the Institute. It was proposed by the Superintendent of the Hanbridge\nPolice. Other personages had wished to propose it, but the stronger\nright of the Hanbridge Superintendent, as chief officer of the largest\nforce of constables in the Five Towns, could not be disputed. He made a\nfew facetious references to the episode of the Countess's arrival, and\nbrought the house down by saying that if he did his duty he would arrest\nboth the Countess and Denry for driving to the common danger. When he\nsat down, amid tempestuous applause, there was a hitch. According to the\nofficial programme Sir Jehoshophat Dain was to have seconded the vote,\nand Sir Jee was not there. All that remained of Sir Jee was his chair.\nThe Mayor of Hanbridge looked round about, trying swiftly to make up his\nmind what was to be done, and Denry heard him whisper to another mayor\nfor advice.\n\n\"Shall I do it?\" Denry whispered, and by at once rising relieved the\nMayor from the necessity of coming to a decision.\n\nImpossible to say why Denry should have risen as he did, without any\nwarning. Ten seconds before, five seconds before, he himself had not the\ndimmest idea that he was about to address the meeting. All that can be\nsaid is that he was subject to these attacks of the unexpected.\n\nOnce on his legs he began to suffer, for he had never before been on his\nlegs on a platform, or even on a platform at all. He could see nothing\nwhatever except a cloud that had mysteriously and with frightful\nsuddenness filled the room. And through this cloud he could feel that\nhundreds and hundreds of eyes were piercingly fixed upon him. A voice\nwas saying inside him--\"What a fool you are! What a fool you are! I\nalways told you you were a fool!\" And his heart was beating as it had\nnever beat, and his forehead was damp, his throat distressingly dry, and\none foot nervously tap-tapping on the floor. This condition lasted for\nsomething like ten hours, during which time the eyes continued to pierce\nthe cloud and him with patient, obstinate cruelty.\n\nDenry heard some one talking. It was himself.\n\nThe Superintendent had said: \"I have very great pleasure in proposing\nthe vote of thanks to the Countess of Chell.\"\n\nAnd so Denry heard himself saying: \"I have very great pleasure in\nseconding the vote of thanks to the Countess of Chell.\"\n\nHe could not think of anything else to say. And there was a pause, a\nreal pause, not a pause merely in Denry's sick imagination.\n\nThen the cloud was dissipated. And Denry himself said to the audience of\npolicemen, with his own natural tone, smile and gesture, colloquially,\ninformally, comically:\n\n\"Now then! Move along there, please! I'm not going to say any more!\"\n\nAnd for a signal he put his hands in the position for applauding. And\nsat down.\n\nHe had tickled the stout ribs of every bobby in the place. The applause\nsurpassed all previous applause. The most staid ornaments of the\nplatform had to laugh. People nudged each other and explained that it\nwas \"that chap Machin from Bursley,\" as if to imply that that chap\nMachin from Bursley never let a day pass without doing something\nstriking and humorous. The Mayor was still smiling when he put the vote\nto the meeting, and the Countess was still smiling when she responded.\n\nAfterwards in the portico, when everything was over, Denry exercised his\nright to remain in charge of the Countess. They escaped from the\npersonages by going out to look for her carriage and neglecting to\nreturn. There was no sign of the Countess's carriage, but Denry's mule\nand victoria were waiting in a quiet corner.\n\n\"May I drive you home?\" he suggested.\n\nBut she would not. She said that she had a call to pay before dinner,\nand that her brougham would surely arrive the very next minute.\n\n\"Will you come and have tea at the Sub Rosa?\" Denry next asked.\n\n\"The Sub Rosa?\" questioned the Countess.\n\n\"Well,\" said Denry, \"that's what we call the new tea-room that's just\nbeen opened round here.\" He indicated a direction. \"It's quite a novelty\nin the Five Towns.\"\n\nThe Countess had a passion for tea.\n\n\"They have splendid China tea,\" said Denry.\n\n\"Well,\" said the Countess, \"I suppose I may as well go through with it.\"\n\nAt the moment her brougham drove up. She instructed her coachman to wait\nnext to the mule and victoria. Her demeanour had cast off all its\nsimilarity to her dress: it appeared to imply that, as she had begun\nwith a mad escapade, she ought to finish with another one.\n\nThus the Countess and Denry went to the tea-shop, and Denry ordered tea\nand paid for it. There was scarcely a customer in the place, and the few\nwho were fortunate enough to be present had not the wit to recognise the\nCountess. The proprietress did not recognise the Countess. (Later, when\nit became known that the Countess had actually patronised the Sub Rosa,\nhalf the ladies of Hanbridge were almost ill from sheer disgust that\nthey had not heard of it in time. It would have been so easy for them to\nbe there, taking tea at the next table to the Countess, and observing\nher choice of cakes, and her manner of holding a spoon, and whether she\nremoved her gloves or retained them in the case of a meringue. It was an\nopportunity lost that would in all human probability never occur again.)\n\nAnd in the discreet corner which she had selected the Countess fired a\nsudden shot at Denry.\n\n\"How did you get all those details about the state rooms at Sneyd?\" she\nasked.\n\nUpon which opening the conversation became lively.\n\nThe same evening Denry called at the _Signal_ office and gave an\norder for a half-page advertisement of the Five Towns Universal Thrift\nClub--\"Patroness, the Countess of Chell.\" The advertisement informed\nthe public that the club had now made arrangements to accept new\nmembers. Besides the order for a half-page advertisement, Denry also\ngave many interesting and authentic details about the historic drive\nfrom Sneyd Vale to Hanbridge. The next day the _Signal_ was simply\nfull of Denry and the Countess. It had a large photograph, taken by a\nphotographer on Cauldon Bank, which showed Denry actually driving the\nCountess, and the Countess's face was full in the picture. It presented,\ntoo, an excellently appreciative account of Denry's speech, and it\ncongratulated Denry on his first appearance in the public life of the\nFive Towns. (In parenthesis it sympathised with Sir Jee in his\nindisposition.) In short, Denry's triumph obliterated the memory of his\nprevious triumphs. It obliterated, too, all rumours adverse to the\nThrift Club. In a few days he had a thousand new members. Of course,\nthis addition only increased his liabilities; but now he could obtain\ncapital on fair terms, and he did obtain it. A company was formed. The\nCountess had a few shares in this company. So (strangely) had Jock and\nhis companion the coachman. Not the least of the mysteries was that when\nDenry reached his mother's cottage on the night of the tea with the\nCountess, his arm was not in a sling, and showed no symptom of having\nbeen damaged.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nRAISING A WIGWAM\n\n\nI\n\nA still young man--his age was thirty--with a short, strong beard\npeeping out over the fur collar of a vast overcoat, emerged from a cab\nat the snowy corner of St Luke's Square and Brougham Street, and paid\nthe cabman with a gesture that indicated both wealth and the habit of\ncommand. And the cabman, who had driven him over from Hanbridge through\nthe winter night, responded accordingly. Few people take cabs in the\nFive Towns. There are few cabs to take. If you are going to a party you\nmay order one in advance by telephone, reconciling yourself also in\nadvance to the expense, but to hail a cab in the street without\nforethought and jump into it as carelessly as you would jump into a\ntram--this is by very few done. The young man with the beard did it\nfrequently, which proved that he was fundamentally ducal.\n\nHe was encumbered with a large and rather heavy parcel as he walked down\nBrougham Street, and, moreover, the footpath of Brougham Street was\nexceedingly dirty. And yet no one acquainted with the circumstances of\nhis life would have asked why he had dismissed the cab before arriving\nat his destination, because every one knew. The reason was that this\nducal person, with the gestures of command, dared not drive up to his\nmother's door in a cab oftener than about once a month. He opened that\ndoor with a latch-key (a modern lock was almost the only innovation that\nhe had succeeded in fixing on his mother), and stumbled with his\nunwieldy parcel into the exceedingly narrow lobby.\n\n\"Is that you, Denry?\" called a feeble voice from the parlour.\n\n\"Yes,\" said he, and went into the parlour, hat, fur coat, parcel, and\nall.\n\nMrs Machin, in a shawl and an antimacassar over the shawl, sat close to\nthe fire and leaning towards it. She looked cold and ill. Although the\nparlour was very tiny and the fire comparatively large, the structure of\nthe grate made it impossible that the room should be warm, as all the\nheat went up the chimney. If Mrs Machin had sat on the roof and put her\nhands over the top of the chimney, she would have been much warmer than\nat the grate.\n\n\"You aren't in bed?\" Denry queried.\n\n\"Can't ye see?\" said his mother. And, indeed, to ask a woman who was\nobviously sitting up in a chair whether she was in bed, did seem\nsomewhat absurd. She added, less sarcastically: \"I was expecting ye\nevery minute. Where have ye had your tea?\"\n\n\"Oh!\" he said lightly, \"in Hanbridge.\"\n\nAn untruth! He had not had his tea anywhere. But he had dined richly at\nthe new H\u00c3\u00b4tel M\u00c3\u00a9tropole, Hanbridge.\n\n\"What have ye got there?\" asked his mother.\n\n\"A present for you,\" said Denry. \"It's your birthday to-morrow.\"\n\n\"I don't know as I want reminding of that,\" murmured Mrs Machin.\n\nBut when he had undone the parcel and held up the contents before her,\nshe exclaimed:\n\n\"Bless us!\"\n\nThe staggered tone was an admission that for once in a way he had\nimpressed her.\n\nIt was a magnificent sealskin mantle, longer than sealskin mantles\nusually are. It was one of those articles the owner of which can say:\n\"Nobody can have a better than this--I don't care who she is.\" It was\nworth in monetary value all the plain, shabby clothes on Mrs Machin's\nback, and all her very ordinary best clothes upstairs, and all the\nfurniture in the entire house, and perhaps all Denry's dandiacal\nwardrobe too, except his fur coat. If the entire contents of the\ncottage, with the aforesaid exception, had been put up to auction, they\nwould not have realised enough to pay for that sealskin mantle.\n\nHad it been anything but a sealskin mantle, and equally costly, Mrs\nMachin would have upbraided. But a sealskin mantle is not \"showy.\" It\n\"goes with\" any and every dress and bonnet. And the most respectable,\nthe most conservative, the most austere woman may find legitimate\npleasure in wearing it. A sealskin mantle is the sole luxurious\nostentation that a woman of Mrs Machin's temperament--and there are many\nsuch in the Five Towns and elsewhere--will conscientiously permit\nherself.\n\n\"Try it on,\" said Denry.\n\nShe rose weakly and tried it on. It fitted as well as a sealskin mantle\ncan fit.\n\n\"My word--it's warm!\" she said. This was her sole comment.\n\n\"Keep it on,\" said Denry.\n\nHis mother's glance withered the suggestion.\n\n\"Where are you going?\" he asked, as she left the room.\n\n\"To put it away,\" said she. \"I must get some moth-powder to-morrow.\"\n\nHe protested with inarticulate noises, removed his own furs, which he\nthrew down on to the old worn-out sofa, and drew a Windsor chair up to\nthe fire. After a while his mother returned, and sat down in her\nrocking-chair, and began to shiver again under the shawl and the\nantimacassar. The lamp on the table lighted up the left side of her face\nand the right side of his.\n\n\"Look here, mother,\" said he, \"you must have a doctor.\"\n\n\"I shall have no doctor.\"\n\n\"You've got influenza, and it's a very tricky business--influenza is;\nyou never know where you are with it.\"\n\n\"Ye can call it influenza if ye like,\" said Mrs Machin. \"There was no\ninfluenza in my young days. We called a cold a cold.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Denry, \"you aren't well, are you?\"\n\n\"I never said I was,\" she answered grimly.\n\n\"No,\" said Denry, with the triumphant ring of one who is about to\ndevastate an enemy. \"And you never will be in this rotten old cottage.\"\n\n\"This was reckoned a very good class of house when your father and I\ncame into it. And it's always been kept in repair. It was good enough\nfor your father, and it's good enough for me. I don't see myself\nflitting. But some folks have gotten so grand. As for health, old Reuben\nnext door is ninety-one. How many people over ninety are there in those\ngimcrack houses up by the Park, I should like to know?\"\n\nDenry could argue with any one save his mother. Always, when he was\nabout to reduce her to impotence, she fell on him thus and rolled him in\nthe dust. Still, he began again.\n\n\"Do we pay four-and-sixpence a week for this cottage, or don't we?\" he\ndemanded.\n\n\"And always have done,\" said Mrs Machin. \"I should like to see the\nlandlord put it up,\" she added, formidably, as if to say: \"I'd landlord\nhim, if he tried to put _my_ rent up!\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Denry, \"here we are living in a four-and-six-a-week\ncottage, and do you know how much I'm making? I'm making two thousand\npounds a year. That's what I'm making.\"\n\nA second wilful deception of his mother! As Managing Director of the\nFive Towns Universal Thrift Club, as proprietor of the majority of its\nshares, as its absolute autocrat, he was making very nearly four\nthousand a year. Why could he not as easily have said four as two to his\nmother? The simple answer is that he was afraid to say four. It was as\nif he ought to blush before his mother for being so plutocratic, his\nmother who had passed most of her life in hard toil to gain a few\nshillings a week. Four thousand seemed so fantastic! And in fact the\nThrift Club, which he had invented in a moment, had arrived at a\nprodigious success, with its central offices in Hanbridge and its branch\noffices in the other four towns, and its scores of clerks and collectors\npresided over by Mr Penkethman. It had met with opposition. The mighty\nsaid that Denry was making an unholy fortune under the guise of\nphilanthropy. And to be on the safe side the Countess of Chell had\nresigned her official patronage of the club and given her shares to the\nPirehill Infirmary, which had accepted the high dividends on them\nwithout the least protest. As for Denry, he said that he had never set\nout to be a philanthropist nor posed as one, and that his unique\nintention was to grow rich by supplying a want, like the rest of them,\nand that anyhow there was no compulsion to belong to his Thrift Club.\nThen letters in his defence from representatives of the thousands and\nthousands of members of the club rained into the columns of the\n_Signal_, and Denry was the most discussed personage in the county.\nIt was stated that such thrift clubs, under various names, existed in\nseveral large towns in Yorkshire and Lancashire. This disclosure\nrehabilitated Denry completely in general esteem, for whatever obtains\nin Yorkshire and Lancashire must be right for Staffordshire; but it\nrather dashed Denry, who was obliged to admit to himself that after all\nhe had not invented the Thrift Club. Finally the hundreds of tradesmen\nwho had bound themselves to allow a discount of twopence in the shilling\nto the club (sole source of the club's dividends) had endeavoured to\nrevolt. Denry effectually cowed them by threatening to establish\nco-operative stores--there was not a single co-operative store in the\nFive Towns. They knew he would have the wild audacity to do it.\n\nThenceforward the progress of the Thrift Club had been unruffled. Denry\nwaxed amazingly in importance. His mule died. He dared not buy a proper\nhorse and dogcart, because he dared not bring such an equipage to the\nfront door of his mother's four-and-sixpenny cottage. So he had taken to\ncabs. In all exterior magnificence and lavishness he equalled even the\ngreat Harold Etches, of whom he had once been afraid; and like Etches he\nbecame a famous _habitu\u00c3\u00a9_ of Llandudno pier. But whereas Etches\nlived with his wife in a superb house at Bleakridge, Denry lived with\nhis mother in a ridiculous cottage in ridiculous Brougham Street. He had\na regiment of acquaintances and he accepted a lot of hospitality, but he\ncould not return it at Brougham Street. His greatness fizzled into\nnothing in Brougham Street. It stopped short and sharp at the corner of\nSt Luke's Square, where he left his cabs. He could do nothing with his\nmother. If she was not still going out as a sempstress the reason was,\nnot that she was not ready to go out, but that her old clients had\nceased to send for her. And could they be blamed for not employing at\nthree shillings a day the mother of a young man who wallowed in\nthousands sterling? Denry had essayed over and over again to instil\nreason into his mother, and he had invariably failed. She was too\nindependent, too profoundly rooted in her habits; and her character had\nmore force than his. Of course, he might have left her and set up a\nsuitably gorgeous house of his own.\n\nBut he would not.\n\nIn fact, they were a remarkable pair.\n\nOn this eve of her birthday he had meant to cajole her into some step,\nto win her by an appeal, basing his argument on her indisposition. But\nhe was being beaten off once more. The truth was that a cajoling,\ncaressing tone could not be long employed towards Mrs Machin. She was\nnot persuasive herself, nor; favourable to persuasiveness in others.\n\n\"Well,\" said she, \"if you're making two thousand a year, ye can spend it\nor save it as ye like, though ye'd better save it. Ye never know what\nmay happen in these days. There was a man dropped half-a-crown down a\ngrid opposite only the day before yesterday.\"\n\nDenry laughed.\n\n\"Ay!\" she said; \"ye can laugh.\"\n\n\"There's no doubt about one thing,\" he said, \"you ought to be in bed.\nYou ought to stay in bed for two or three days at least.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she said. \"And who's going to look after the house while I'm\nmoping between blankets?\"\n\n\"You can have Rose Chudd in,\" he said.\n\n\"No,\" said she. \"I'm not going to have any woman rummaging about my\nhouse, and me in bed.\"\n\n\"You know perfectly well she's been practically starving since her\nhusband died, and as she's going out charing, why can't you have her and\nput a bit of bread into her mouth?\"\n\n\"Because I won't have her! Neither her nor any one. There's naught to\nprevent you giving her some o' your two thousand a year if you've a\nmind. But I see no reason for my house being turned upside down by her,\neven if I _have_ got a bit of a cold.\"\n\n\"You're an unreasonable old woman,\" said Denry.\n\n\"Happen I am!\" said she. \"There can't be two wise ones in a family. But\nI'm not going to give up this cottage, and as long as I am standing on\nmy feet I'm not going to pay any one for doing what I can do better\nmyself.\" A pause. \"And so you needn't think it! You can't come round me\nwith a fur mantle.\" She retired to rest. On the following morning he was\nvery glum.\n\n\"You needn't be so glum,\" she said.\n\nBut she was rather pleased at his glumness. For in him glumness was a\nsign that he recognised defeat.\n\n\nII\n\nThe next episode between them was curiously brief. Denry had influenza.\nHe said that naturally he had caught hers.\n\nHe went to bed and stayed there. She nursed him all day, and grew angry\nin a vain attempt to force him to eat. Towards night he tossed furiously\non the little bed in the little bedroom, complaining of fearful\nheadaches. She remained by his side most of the night. In the morning he\nwas easier. Neither of them mentioned the word \"doctor.\" She spent the\nday largely on the stairs. Once more towards night he grew worse, and\nshe remained most of the second night by his side.\n\nIn the sinister winter dawn Denry murmured in a feeble tone:\n\n\"Mother, you'd better send for him.\"\n\n\"Doctor?\" she said. And secretly she thought that she _had_ better\nsend for the doctor, and that there must be after all some difference\nbetween influenza and a cold.\n\n\"No,\" said Denry; \"send for young Lawton.\"\n\n\"Young Lawton!\" she exclaimed. \"What do you want young Lawton to come\n_here_ for?\"\n\n\"I haven't made my will,\" Denry answered.\n\n\"Pooh!\" she retorted.\n\nNevertheless she was the least bit in the world frightened. And she sent\nfor Dr Stirling, the aged Harrop's Scotch partner.\n\nDr Stirling, who was full-bodied and left little space for anybody else\nin the tiny, shabby bedroom of the man with four thousand a year, gazed\nat Mrs Machin, and he gazed also at Denry.\n\n\"Ye must go to bed this minute,\" said he.\n\n\"But he's _in_ bed,\" cried Mrs Machin.\n\n\"I mean yerself,\" said Dr Stirling.\n\nShe was very nearly at the end of her resources. And the proof was that\nshe had no strength left to fight Dr Stirling. She did go to bed. And\nshortly afterwards Denry got up. And a little later, Rose Chudd, that\nprim and efficient young widow from lower down the street, came into the\nhouse and controlled it as if it had been her own. Mrs Machin, whose\nconstitution was hardy, arose in about a week, cured, and duly dismissed\nRose with wages and without thanks. But Rose had been. Like the\n_Signal's_ burglars, she had \"effected an entrance.\" And the house\nhad not been turned upside down. Mrs Machin, though she tried, could not\nfind fault with the result of Rose's uncontrolled activities.\n\n\nIII\n\nOne morning--and not very long afterwards, in such wise did Fate seem to\nfavour the young at the expense of the old--Mrs Machin received two\nletters which alarmed and disgusted her. One was from her landlord,\nannouncing that he had sold the house in which she lived to a Mr\nWilbraham of London, and that in future she must pay the rent to the\nsaid Mr Wilbraham or his legal representatives. The other was from a\nfirm of London solicitors announcing that their client, Mr Wilbraham,\nhad bought the house, and that the rent must be paid to their agent,\nwhom they would name later.\n\nMrs Machin gave vent to her emotion in her customary manner: \"Bless us!\"\n\nAnd she showed the impudent letters to Denry.\n\n\"Oh!\" said Denry. \"So he has bought them, has he? I heard he was going\nto.\"\n\n\"Them?\" exclaimed Mrs Machin. \"What else has he bought?\"\n\n\"I expect he's bought all the five--this and the four below, as far as\nDownes's. I expect you'll find that the other four have had notices just\nlike these. You know all this row used to belong to the Wilbrahams. You\nsurely must remember that, mother?\"\n\n\"Is he one of the Wilbrahams of Hillport, then?\"\n\n\"Yes, of course he is.\"\n\n\"I thought the last of 'em was Cecil, and when he'd beggared himself\nhere he went to Australia and died of drink. That's what I always heard.\nWe always used to say as there wasn't a Wilbraham left.\"\n\n\"He did go to Australia, but he didn't die of drink. He disappeared, and\nwhen he'd made a fortune he turned up again in Sydney, so it seems. I\nheard he's thinking of coming back here to settle. Anyhow, he's buying\nup a lot of the Wilbraham property. I should have thought you'd have\nheard of it. Why, lots of people have been talking about it.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Mrs Machin, \"I don't like it.\"\n\nShe objected to a law which permitted a landlord to sell a house over\nthe head of a tenant who had occupied it for more than thirty years. In\nthe course of the morning she discovered that Denry was right--the other\ntenants had received notices exactly similar to hers.\n\nTwo days later Denry arrived home for tea with a most surprising article\nof news. Mr Cecil Wilbraham had been down to Bursley from London, and\nhad visited him, Denry. Mr Cecil Wilbraham's local information was\nevidently quite out of date, for he had imagined Denry to be a\nrent-collector and estate agent, whereas the fact was that Denry had\nabandoned this minor vocation years ago. His desire had been that Denry\nshould collect his rents and watch over his growing interests in the\ndistrict.\n\n\"So what did you tell him?\" asked Mrs Machin.\n\n\"I told him I'd do it.\" said Denry.\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"I thought it might be safer for _you_,\" said Denry, with a certain\nemphasis. \"And, besides, it looked as if it might be a bit of a lark.\nHe's a very peculiar chap.\"\n\n\"Peculiar?\"\n\n\"For one thing, he's got the largest moustaches of any man I ever saw.\nAnd there's something up with his left eye. And then I think he's a bit\nmad.\"\n\n\"Mad?\"\n\n\"Well, touched. He's got a notion about building a funny sort of a house\nfor himself on a plot of land at Bleakridge. It appears he's fond of\nliving alone, and he's collected all kind of dodges for doing without\nservants and still being comfortable.\"\n\n\"Ay! But he's right there!\" breathed Mrs Machin in deep sympathy. As she\nsaid about once a week, \"She never could abide the idea of servants.\"\n\"He's not married, then?\" she added.\n\n\"He told me he'd been a widower three times, but he'd never had any\nchildren,\" said Denry.\n\n\"Bless us!\" murmured Mrs Machin.\n\nDenry was the one person in the town who enjoyed the acquaintance and\nthe confidence of the thrice-widowed stranger with long moustaches. He\nhad descended without notice on Bursley, seen Denry (at the branch\noffice of the Thrift Club), and then departed. It was understood that\nlater he would permanently settle in the district. Then the wonderful\nhouse began to rise on the plot of land at Bleakridge. Denry had general\ncharge of it, but always subject to erratic and autocratic instructions\nfrom London. Thanks to Denry, who, since the historic episode at\nLlandudno, had remained very friendly with the Cotterill family, Mr\nCotterill had the job of building the house; the plans came from London.\nAnd though Mr Cecil Wilbraham proved to be exceedingly watchful against\nany form of imposition, the job was a remunerative one for Mr Cotterill,\nwho talked a great deal about the originality of the residence. The town\njudged of the wealth and importance of Mr Cecil Wilbraham by the fact\nthat a person so wealthy and important as Denry should be content to act\nas his agent. But then the Wilbrahams had been magnates in the Bursley\nregion for generations, up till the final Wilbraham smash in the late\nseventies. The town hungered to see those huge moustaches and that\npeculiar eye. In addition to Denry, only one person had seen the madman,\nand that person was Nellie Cotterill, who had been viewing the\nhalf-built house with Denry one Sunday morning when the madman had most\nastonishingly arrived upon the scene, and after a few minutes vanished.\nThe building of the house strengthened greatly the friendship between\nDenry and the Cotterills. Yet Denry neither liked Mr Cotterill nor\ntrusted him. The next incident in these happening was that\nMrs Machin received notice from the London firm to quit her\nfour-and-sixpence-a-week cottage. It seemed to her that not merely\nBrougham Street, but the world, was coming to an end. She was very angry\nwith Denry for not protecting her more successfully. He was Mr\nWilbraham's agent, he collected the rent, and it was his duty to guard\nhis mother from unpleasantness. She observed, however, that he was\nremarkably disturbed by the notice, and he assured her that Mr Wilbraham\nhad not consulted him in the matter at all. He wrote a letter to London,\nwhich she signed, demanding the reason of this absurd notice flung at an\nancient and perfect tenant. The reply was that Mr Wilbraham intended to\npull the houses down, beginning with Mrs Machin's, and rebuild.\n\n\"Pooh!\" said Denry. \"Don't you worry your head, mother; I shall arrange\nit. He'll be down here soon to see his new house--it's practically\nfinished, and the furniture is coming in--and I'll just talk to him.\"\n\nBut Mr Wilbraham did not come, the explanation doubtless being that he\nwas mad. On the other hand, fresh notices came with amazing frequency.\nMrs Machin just handed them over to Denry. And then Denry received a\ntelegram to say that Mr Wilbraham would be at his new house that night\nand wished to see Denry there. Unfortunately, on the same day, by the\nafternoon post, while Denry was at his offices, there arrived a sort of\nsupreme and ultimate notice from London to Mrs Machin, and it was on\nblue paper. It stated, baldly, that as Mrs Machin had failed to comply\nwith all the previous notices, had, indeed, ignored them, she and her\ngoods would now be ejected into the street, according to the law. It\ngave her twenty-four hours to flit. Never had a respectable dame been so\ninsulted as Mrs Machin was insulted by that notice. The prospect of\ncamping out in Brougham Street confronted her. When Denry reached home\nthat evening, Mrs Machin, as the phrase is, \"gave it him.\"\n\nDenry admitted frankly that he was nonplussed, staggered and outraged.\nBut the thing was simply another proof of Mr Wilbraham's madness. After\ntea he decided that his mother must put on her best clothes, and go up\nwith him to see Mr Wilbraham and firmly expostulate--in fact, they would\narrange the situation between them; and if Mr Wilbraham was obstinate\nthey would defy Mr Wilbraham. Denry explained to his mother that an\nEnglishwoman's cottage was her castle, that a landlord's minions had no\nright to force an entrance, and that the one thing that Mr Wilbraham\ncould do was to begin unbuilding the cottage from the top outside....\nAnd he would like to see Mr Wilbraham try it on!\n\nSo the sealskin mantle (for it was spring again) went up with Denry to\nBleakridge.\n\n\nIV\n\nThe moon shone in the chill night. The house stood back from Trafalgar\nRoad in the moonlight--a squarish block of a building.\n\n\"Oh!\" said Mrs Machin, \"it isn't so large.\"\n\n\"No! He didn't want it large. He only wanted it large enough,\" said\nDenry, and pushed a button to the right of the front door. There was no\nreply, though they heard the ringing of the bell inside. They waited.\nMrs Machin was very nervous, but thanks to her sealskin mantle she was\nnot cold.\n\n\"This is a funny doorstep,\" she remarked, to kill time.\n\n\"It's of marble,\" said Denry.\n\n\"What's that for?\" asked his mother.\n\n\"So much easier to keep clean,\" said Denry.\n\n\"Well,\" said Mrs Machin, \"it's pretty dirty now, anyway.\"\n\nIt was.\n\n\"Quite simple to clean,\" said Denry, bending down. \"You just turn this\ntap at the side. You see, it's so arranged that it sends a flat jet\nalong the step. Stand off a second.\"\n\nHe turned the tap, and the step was washed pure in a moment.\n\n\"How is it that that water steams?\" Mrs Machin demanded.\n\n\"Because it's hot,\" said Denry. \"Did you ever know water steam for any\nother reason?\"\n\n\"Hot water outside?\"\n\n\"Just as easy to have hot water outside as inside, isn't it?\" said\nDenry.\n\n\"Well, I never!\" exclaimed Mrs Machin. She was impressed.\n\n\"That's how everything's dodged up in this house,\" said Denry. He shut\noff the water.\n\nAnd he rang once again. No answer! No illumination within the abode!\n\n\"I'll tell you what I shall do,\" said Denry at length. \"I shall let\nmyself in. I've got a key of the back door.\"\n\n\"Are you sure it's all right?\"\n\n\"I don't care if it isn't all right,\" said Denry, defiantly. \"He asked\nme to be up here, and he ought to be here to meet me. I'm not going to\nstand any nonsense from anybody.\"\n\nIn they went, having skirted round the walls of the house.\n\nDenry closed the door, pushed a switch, and the electric light shone.\nElectric light was then quite a novelty in Bursley. Mrs Machin had never\nseen it in action. She had to admit that it was less complicated than\noil-lamps. In the kitchen the electric light blazed upon walls tiled in\ngrey and a floor tiled in black and white. There was a gas range and a\nmarble slopstone with two taps. The woodwork was dark. Earthenware\nsaucepans stood on a shelf. The cupboards were full of gear chiefly in\nearthenware. Denry began to exhibit to his mother a tank provided with\nledges and shelves and grooves, in which he said that everything except\nknives could be washed and dried automatically.\n\n\"Hadn't you better go and find your Mr Wilbraham?\" she interrupted.\n\n\"So I had,\" said Denry; \"I was forgetting him.\"\n\nShe heard him wandering over the house and calling in divers tones upon\nMr Wilbraham. But she heard no other voice. Meanwhile she examined the\nkitchen in detail, appreciating some of its devices and failing to\ncomprehend others.\n\n\"I expect he's missed the train,\" said Denry, coming back. \"Anyhow, he\nisn't here. I may as well show you the rest of the house now.\"\n\nHe led her into the hall, which was radiantly lighted.\n\n\"It's quite warm here,\" said Mrs Machin.\n\n\"The whole house is heated by steam,\" said Denry. \"No fireplaces.\"\n\n\"No fireplaces!\"\n\n\"No! No fireplaces. No grates to polish, ashes to carry down, coals to\ncarry up, mantelpieces to dust, fire-irons to clean, fenders to polish,\nchimneys to sweep.\"\n\n\"And suppose he wants a bit of fire all of a sudden in summer?\"\n\n\"Gas stove in every room for emergencies,\" said Denry.\n\nShe glanced into a room.\n\n\"But,\" she cried, \"it's all complete, ready! And as warm as toast.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Denry, \"he gave orders. I can't think why on earth he isn't\nhere.\"\n\nAt that moment an electric bell rang loud and sharp, and Mrs Machin\njumped.\n\n\"There he is!\" said Denry, moving to the door.\n\n\"Bless us! What will he think of us being here like?\" Mrs Machin\nmumbled.\n\n\"Pooh!\" said Denry, carelessly. And he opened the door.\n\n\nV\n\nThree persons stood on the newly-washed marble step--Mr and Mrs\nCotterill and their daughter.\n\n\"Oh! Come in! Come in! Make yourselves quite at home. That's what\n_we're_ doing,\" said Denry in blithe greeting; and added, \"I suppose\nhe's invited you too?\"\n\nAnd it appeared that Mr Cecil Wilbraham had indeed invited them too. He\nhad written from London saying that he would be glad if Mr and Mrs\nCotterill would \"drop in\" on this particular evening. Further, he had\nmentioned that, as be had already had the pleasure of meeting Miss\nCotterill, perhaps she would accompany her parents.\n\n\"Well, he isn't here,\" said Denry, shaking hands. \"He must have missed\nhis train or something. He can't possibly be here now till to-morrow.\nBut the house seems to be all ready for him....\"\n\n\"Yes, my word! And how's yourself, Mrs Cotterill?\" put in Mrs Machin.\n\n\"So we may as well look over it in its finished state. I suppose that's\nwhat he asked us up for,\" Denry concluded.\n\nMrs Machin explained quickly and nervously that she had not been\ncomprised in any invitation; that her errand was pure business.\n\n\"Come on upstairs,\" Denry called out, turning switches and adding\nradiance to radiance.\n\n\"Denry!\" his mother protested, \"I'm sure I don't know what Mr and Mrs\nCotterill will think of you! You carry on as if you owned everything in\nthe place. I wonder _at_ you!\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Denry, \"if anybody in this town is the owner's agent I am.\nAnd Mr Cotterill has built the blessed house. If Wilbraham wanted to\nkeep his old shanty to himself, he shouldn't send out invitations. It's\nsimple enough not to send out invitations. Now, Nellie!\"\n\nHe was hanging over the balustrade at the curve of the stairs.\n\nThe familiar ease with which he said, \"Now, Nellie,\" and especially the\nspontaneity of Nellie's instant response, put new thoughts into the mind\nof Mrs Machin. But she neither pricked up her ears, nor started back,\nnor accomplished any of the acrobatic feats which an ordinary mother of\na wealthy son would have performed under similar circumstances. Her ears\ndid not even tremble. And she just said:\n\n\"I like this balustrade knob being of black china.\"\n\n\"Every knob in the house is of black china,\" said Denry. \"Never shows\ndirt. But if you should take it into your head to clean it, you can do\nit with a damp cloth in a second.\"\n\nNellie now stood beside him. Nellie had grown up since the Llandudno\nepisode. She did not blush at a glance. When spoken to suddenly she\ncould answer without torture to herself. She could, in fact, maintain a\nconversation without breaking down for a much longer time than, a few\nyears ago, she had been able to skip without breaking down. She no\nlonger imagined that all the people in the street were staring at her,\nanxious to find faults in her appearance. She had temporarily ruined the\nlives of several amiable and fairly innocent young men by refusing to\nmarry them. (For she was pretty, and her father cut a figure in the\ntown, though her mother did not.) And yet, despite the immense\naccumulation of her experiences and the weight of her varied knowledge\nof human nature, there was something very girlish and timidly roguish\nabout her as she stood on the stairs near Denry, waiting for the elder\ngeneration to follow. The old Nellie still lived in her.\n\nThe party passed to the first floor.\n\nAnd the first floor exceeded the ground floor in marvels. In each\nbedroom two aluminium taps poured hot and cold water respectively into a\nmarble basin, and below the marble basin was a sink. No porterage of\nwater anywhere in the house. The water came to you, and every room\nconsumed its own slops. The bedsteads were of black enamelled iron and\nvery light. The floors were covered with linoleum, with a few rugs that\ncould be shaken with one hand. The walls were painted with grey enamel.\nMrs Cotterill, with her all-seeing eye, observed a detail that Mrs\nMachin had missed. There were no sharp corners anywhere. Every corner,\nevery angle between wall and floor or wall and wall, was rounded, to\nfacilitate cleaning. And every wall, floor, ceiling, and fixture could\nbe washed, and all the furniture was enamelled and could be wiped with a\ncloth in a moment instead of having to be polished with three cloths and\nmany odours in a day and a half. The bath-room was absolutely\nwaterproof; you could spray it with a hose, and by means of a gas\napparatus you could produce an endless supply of hot water independent\nof the general supply. Denry was apparently familiar with each detail of\nMr Wilbraham's manifold contrivances, and he explained them with an\nenormous gusto.\n\n\"Bless us!\" said Mrs Machin.\n\n\"Bless us!\" said Mrs Cotterill (doubtless the force of example).\n\nThey descended to the dining-room, where a supper-table had been laid by\norder of the invisible Mr Cecil Wilbraham. And there the ladies lauded\nMr Wilbraham's wisdom in eschewing silver. Everything of the table\nservice that could be of earthenware was of earthenware. The forks and\nspoons were electro-plate.\n\n\"Why,\" Mrs Cotterill said, \"I could run this house without a servant and\nhave myself tidy by ten o'clock in a morning.\"\n\nAnd Mrs Machin nodded.\n\n\"And then when you want a regular turn-out, as you call it,\" said Denry,\n\"there's the vacuum-cleaner.\"\n\nThe vacuum-cleaner was at that period the last word of civilisation, and\nthe first agency for it was being set up in Bursley. Denry explained the\nvacuum-cleaner to the housewives, who had got no further than a Ewbank.\nAnd they again called down blessings on themselves.\n\n\"What price this supper?\" Denry exclaimed. \"We ought to eat it. I'm sure\nhe'd like us to eat it. Do sit down, all of you. I'll take the\nconsequences.\"\n\nMrs Machin hesitated even more than the other ladies.\n\n\"It's really very strange, him not being here.\" She shook her head.\n\n\"Don't I tell you he's quite mad,\" said Denry.\n\n\"I shouldn't think he was so mad as all that,\" said Mrs Machin, dryly.\n\"This is the most sensible kind of a house I've ever seen.\"\n\n\"Oh! Is it?\" Denry answered. \"Great Scott! I never noticed those three\nbottles of wine on the sideboard.\"\n\nAt length he succeeded in seating them at the table. Thenceforward there\nwas no difficulty. The ample and diversified cold supper began to\ndisappear steadily, and the wine with it. And as the wine disappeared so\ndid Mr Cotterill (who had been pompous and taciturn) grow talkative,\noffering to the company the exact figures of the cost of the house, and\nso forth. But ultimately the sheer joy of life killed arithmetic.\n\nMrs Machin, however, could not quite rid herself of the notion that she\nwas in a dream that outraged the proprieties. The entire affair, for an\nunromantic spot like Bursley, was too fantastically and wickedly\nromantic.\n\n\"We must be thinking about home, Denry,\" said she.\n\n\"Plenty of time,\" Denry replied. \"What! All that wine gone! I'll see if\nthere's any more in the sideboard.\"\n\nHe emerged, with a red face, from bending into the deeps of the\nenamelled sideboard, and a wine-bottle was in his triumphant hand. It\nhad already been opened.\n\n\"Hooray!\" he proclaimed, pouring a white wine into his glass and raising\nthe glass: \"here's to the health of Mr Cecil Wilbraham.\"\n\nHe made a brave tableau in the brightness of the electric light.\n\nThen he drank. Then he dropped the glass, which broke.\n\n\"Ugh! What's that?\" he demanded, with the distorted features of a\ngargoyle.\n\nHis mother, who was seated next to him, seized the bottle. Denry's hand,\nin clasping the bottle, had hidden a small label, which said:\n\n\"_POISON--Nettleship's Patent Enamel-Cleaning Fluid. One wipe does it_.\"\n\nConfusion! Only Nellie Cotterill seemed to be incapable of realising\nthat a grave accident had occurred. She had laughed throughout the\nsupper, and she still laughed, hysterically, though she had drunk\nscarcely any wine. Her mother silenced her.\n\nDenry was the first to recover.\n\n\"It'll be all right,\" said he, leaning back in his chair. \"They always\nput a bit of poison in those things. It can't hurt me, really. I never\nnoticed the label.\"\n\nMrs Machin smelt at the bottle. She could detect no odour, but the fact\nthat she could detect no odour appeared only to increase her alarm.\n\n\"You must have an emetic instantly,\" she said.\n\n\"Oh no!\" said Denry. \"I shall be all right.\" And he did seem to be\nsuddenly restored.\n\n\"You must have an emetic instantly,\" she repeated.\n\n\"What can I have?\" he grumbled. \"You can't expect to find emetics here.\"\n\n\"Oh yes, I can,\" said she. \"I saw a mustard tin in a cupboard in the\nkitchen. Come along now, and don't be silly.\"\n\nNellie's hysteric mirth surged up again.\n\nDenry objected to accompanying his mother into the kitchen. But he was\nforced to submit. She shut the door on both of them. It is probable that\nduring the seven minutes which they spent mysteriously together in the\nkitchen, the practicability of the kitchen apparatus for carrying off\nwaste products was duly tested. Denry came forth, very pale and very\ncross, on his mother's arm.\n\n\"There's no danger now,\" said his mother, easily.\n\nNaturally the party was at an end. The Cotterills sympathised, and\nprepared to depart, and inquired whether Denry could walk home.\n\nDenry replied, from a sofa, in a weak, expiring voice, that he was\nperfectly incapable of walking home, that his sensations were in the\nhighest degree disconcerting, that he should sleep in that house, as the\nbedrooms were ready for occupation, and that he should expect his mother\nto remain also.\n\nAnd Mrs Machin had to concur. Mrs Machin sped the Cotterills from the\ndoor as though it had been her own door. She was exceedingly angry and\nagitated. But she could not impart her feelings to the suffering Denry.\nHe moaned on a bed for about half-an-hour, and then fell asleep. And in\nthe middle of the night, in the dark, strange house, she also fell\nasleep.\n\n\nVI\n\nThe next morning she arose and went forth, and in about half-an-hour\nreturned. Denry was still in bed, but his health seemed to have resumed\nits normal excellence. Mrs Machin burst upon him in such a state of\ncomplicated excitement as he had never before seen her in.\n\n\"Denry,\" she cried, \"what do you think?\"\n\n\"What?\" said he.\n\n\"I've just been down home, and they're--they're pulling the house down.\nAll the furniture's out, and they've got all the tiles off the roof, and\nthe windows out. And there's a regular crowd watching.\"\n\nDenry sat up.\n\n\"And I can tell you another piece of news,\" said he. \"Mr Cecil Wilbraham\nis dead.\"\n\n\"Dead!\" she breathed.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Denry. \"_I think he's served his purpose._ As we're\nhere, we'll stop here. Don't forget it's the most sensible kind of a\nhouse you've ever seen. Don't forget that Mrs Cotterill could run it\nwithout a servant and have herself tidy by ten o'clock in a morning.\"\n\nMrs Machin perceived then, in a flash of terrible illumination, that\nthere never had been any Cecil Wilbraham; that Denry had merely invented\nhim and his long moustaches and his wall eye for the purpose of getting\nthe better of his mother. The whole affair was an immense swindle upon\nher. Not a Mr Cecil Wilbraham, but her own son had bought her cottage\nover her head and jockeyed her out of it beyond any chance of getting\ninto it again. And to defeat his mother the rascal had not simply\nperverted the innocent Nellie Cotterill to some co-operation in his\nscheme, but he had actually bought four other cottages, because the\nlandlord would not sell one alone, and he was actually demolishing\nproperty to the sole end of stopping her from re-entering it!\n\nOf course, the entire town soon knew of the upshot of the battle, of the\nyear-long battle, between Denry and his mother, and the means adopted by\nDenry to win. The town also had been hoodwinked, but it did not mind\nthat. It loved its Denry the more, and seeing that he was now properly\nestablished in the most remarkable house in the district, it soon\nafterwards made him a Town Councillor as some reward for his talent in\namusing it.\n\nAnd Denry would say to himself:\n\n\"Everything went like clockwork, except the mustard and water. I didn't\nbargain for the mustard and water. And yet, if I was clever enough to\nthink of putting a label on the bottle and to have the beds prepared, I\nought to have been clever enough to keep mustard out of the house.\" It\nwould be wrong to mince the unpleasant fact that the sham poisoning\nwhich he had arranged to the end that he and his mother should pass the\nnight in the house had finished in a manner much too realistic for\nDenry's pleasure. Mustard and water, particularly when mixed by Mrs\nMachin, is mustard and water. She had that consolation.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nTHE GREAT NEWSPAPER WAR\n\n\nI\n\nWhen Denry and his mother had been established a year and a month in the\nnew house at Bleakridge, Denry received a visit one evening which\nperhaps flattered him more than anything had ever flattered him. The\nvisitor was Mr Myson. Now Mr Myson was the founder, proprietor and\neditor of the _Five Towns Weekly_, a new organ of public opinion\nwhich had been in existence about a year; and Denry thought that Mr\nMyson had popped in to see him in pursuit of an advertisement of the\nThrift Club, and at first he was not at all flattered.\n\nBut Mr Myson was not hunting for advertisements, and Denry soon saw him\nto be the kind of man who would be likely to depute that work to others.\nOf middle height, well and quietly dressed, with a sober, assured\ndeportment, he spoke in a voice and accent that were not of the Five\nTowns; they were superior to the Five Towns. And in fact Mr Myson\noriginated in Manchester and had seen London. He was not provincial, and\nhe beheld the Five Towns as part of the provinces; which no native of\nthe Five Towns ever succeeds in doing. Nevertheless, his manner to Denry\nwas the summit of easy and yet deferential politeness.\n\nHe asked permission \"to put something before\" Denry. And when, rather\ntaken aback by such smooth phrases, Denry had graciously accorded the\npermission, he gave a brief history of the _Five Towns Weekly_,\nshowing how its circulation had grown, and definitely stating that at\nthat moment it was yielding a profit. Then he said:\n\n\"Now my scheme is to turn it into a daily.\"\n\n\"Very good notion,\" said Denry, instinctively.\n\n\"I'm glad you think so,\" said Mr Myson. \"Because I've come here in the\nhope of getting your assistance. I'm a stranger to the district, and I\nwant the co-operation of some one who isn't. So I've come to you. I need\nmoney, of course, though I have myself what most people would consider\nsufficient capital. But what I need more than money is--well--moral\nsupport.\"\n\n\"And who put you on to me?\" asked Denry.\n\nMr Myson smiled. \"I put myself on to you,\" said he. \"I think I may say\nI've got my bearings in the Five Towns, after over a year's journalism\nin it, and it appeared to me that you were the best man I could\napproach. I always believe in flying high.\"\n\nTherein was Denry flattered. The visit seemed to him to seal his\nposition in the district in a way in which his election to the Bursley\nTown Council had failed to do. He had been somehow disappointed with\nthat election. He had desired to display his interest in the serious\nwelfare of the town, and to answer his opponent's arguments with better\nones. But the burgesses of his ward appeared to have no passionate love\nof logic. They just cried \"Good old Denry!\" and elected him--with a\nmajority of only forty-one votes. He had expected to feel a different\nDenry when he could put \"Councillor\" before his name. It was not so. He\nhad been solemnly in the mayoral procession to church, he had attended\nmeetings of the council, he had been nominated to the Watch Committee.\nBut he was still precisely the same Denry, though the youngest member of\nthe council. But now he was being recognised from the outside. Mr\nMyson's keen Manchester eye, ranging over the quarter of a million\ninhabitants of the Five Towns in search of a representative individual\nforce, had settled on Denry Machin. Yes, he was flattered. Mr Myson's\nchoice threw a rose-light on all Denry's career: his wealth and its\norigin; his house and stable, which were the astonishment and the\nadmiration of the town; his Universal Thrift Club; yea, and his\ncouncillorship! After all, these _were_ marvels. (And possibly the\ngreatest marvel was the resigned presence of his mother in that wondrous\nhouse, and the fact that she consented to employ Rose Chudd, the\nincomparable Sappho of charwomen, for three hours every day.)\n\nIn fine, he perceived from Mr Myson's eyes that his position was unique.\n\nAnd after they had chatted a little, and the conversation had deviated\nmomentarily from journalism to house property, he offered to display\nMachin House (as he had christened it) to Mr Myson, and Mr Myson was\nreally impressed beyond the ordinary. Mr Myson's homage to Mrs Machin,\nwhom they chanced on in the paradise of the bath-room, was the polished\nmirror of courtesy. How Denry wished that he could behave like that when\nhe happened to meet countesses.\n\nThen, once more in the drawing-room, they resumed the subject of\nnewspapers.\n\n\"You know,\" said Mr Myson, \"it's really a very bad thing indeed for a\ndistrict to have only one daily newspaper. I've nothing myself to say\nagainst _The Staffordshire Signal_, but you'd perhaps be\nastonished\"--this in a confidential tone--\"at the feeling there is\nagainst the _Signal_ in many quarters.\"\n\n\"Really!\" said Denry.\n\n\"Of course its fault is that it isn't sufficiently interested in the\ngreat public questions of the district. And it can't be. Because it\ncan't take a definite side. It must try to please all parties. At any\nrate it must offend none. That is the great evil of a journalistic\nmonopoly.... Two hundred and fifty thousand people--why! there is an\nample public for two first-class papers. Look at Nottingham! Look at\nBristol! Look at Leeds! Look at Sheffield!...and _their_\nnewspapers.\"\n\nAnd Denry endeavoured to look at these great cities! Truly the Five\nTowns was just about as big.\n\nThe dizzy journalistic intoxication seized him. He did not give Mr Myson\nan answer at once, but he gave himself an answer at once. He would go\ninto the immense adventure. He was very friendly with the _Signal_\npeople--certainly; but business was business, and the highest welfare of\nthe Five Towns was the highest welfare of the Five Towns.\n\nSoon afterwards all the hoardings of the district spoke with one blue\nvoice, and said that the _Five Towns Weekly_ was to be transformed\ninto the _Five Towns Daily_, with four editions, beginning each day\nat noon, and that the new organ would be conducted on the lines of a\nfirst-class evening paper.\n\nThe inner ring of knowing ones knew that a company entitled \"The Five\nTowns Newspapers, Limited,\" had been formed, with a capital of ten\nthousand pounds, and that Mr Myson held three thousand pounds' worth of\nshares, and the great Denry Machin one thousand five hundred, and that\nthe remainder were to be sold and allotted as occasion demanded. The\ninner ring said that nothing would ever be able to stand up against the\n_Signal_. On the other hand, it admitted that Denry, the most\nprodigious card ever born into the Five Towns, had never been floored by\nanything. The inner ring anticipated the future with glee. Denry and Mr\nMyson anticipated the future with righteous confidence. As for the\n_Signal_, it went on its august way, blind to sensational\nhoardings.\n\n\nII\n\nOn the day of the appearance of the first issue of the _Five Towns\nDaily_, the offices of the new paper at Hanbridge gave proof of their\nexcellent organisation, working in all details with an admirable\nsmoothness. In the basement a Marinoni machine thundered like a sucking\ndove to produce fifteen thousand copies an hour. On the ground floor\ningenious arrangements had been made for publishing the paper; in\nparticular, the iron railings to keep the boys in order in front of the\npublishing counter had been imitated from the _Signal_. On the\nfirst floor was the editor and founder with his staff, and above that\nthe composing department. The number of stairs that separated the\ncomposing department from the machine-room was not a positive advantage,\nbut bricks and mortar are inelastic, and one does what one can. The\noffices looked very well from the outside, and they compared passably\nwith the offices of the _Signal_ close by. The posters were duly in\nthe ground-floor windows, and gold signs, one above another to the roof,\nproduced an air of lucrative success.\n\nDenry happened to be in the _Daily_ offices that afternoon. He had\nhad nothing to do with the details of organisation, for details of\norganisation were not his speciality. His speciality was large, leading\nideas. He knew almost nothing of the agreements with correspondents and\nPress Association and Central News, and the racing services and the\nfiction syndicates, nor of the difficulties with the Compositors' Union,\nnor of the struggle to lower the price of paper by the twentieth of a\npenny per pound, nor of the awful discounts allowed to certain\nadvertisers, nor of the friction with the railway company, nor of the\nsickening adulation that had been lavished on quite unimportant\nnewsagents, nor--worst of all--of the dearth of newsboys. These matters\ndid not attract him. He could not stoop to them. But when Mr Myson, calm\nand proud, escorted him down to the machine-room, and the Marinoni threw\na folded pink _Daily_ almost into his hands, and it looked exactly\nlike a real newspaper, and he saw one of his own descriptive articles in\nit, and he reflected that he was an owner of it--then Denry was\nattracted and delighted, and his heart beat. For this pink thing was the\nsymbol and result of the whole affair, and had the effect of a miracle\non him.\n\nAnd he said to himself, never guessing how many thousands of men had\nsaid it before him, that a newspaper was the finest toy in the world.\n\nAbout four o'clock the publisher, in shirt sleeves and an apron, came up\nto Mr Myson and respectfully asked him to step into the publishing\noffice. Mr Myson stepped into the publishing office and Denry with him,\nand they there beheld a small ragged boy with a bleeding nose and a\nbundle of _Dailys_ in his wounded hand.\n\n\"Yes,\" the boy sobbed; \"and they said they'd cut my eyes out and plee\n[play] marbles wi' 'em, if they cotched me in Crown Square agen,\" And he\nthrew down the papers with a final yell.\n\nThe two directors learnt that the delicate threat had been uttered by\nfour _Signal_ boys, who had objected to any fellow-boys offering\nany paper other than the _Signal_ for sale in Crown Square or\nanywhere else.\n\nOf course, it was absurd.\n\nStill, absurd as it was, it continued. The central publishing offices of\nthe _Daily_ at Hanbridge, and its branch offices in the\nneighbouring towns, were like military hospitals, and the truth appeared\nto the directors that while the public was panting to buy copies of the\n_Daily_, the sale of the _Daily_ was being prevented by means\nof a scandalous conspiracy on the part of _Signal_ boys. For it\nmust be understood that in the Five Towns people prefer to catch their\nnewspaper in the street as it flies and cries. The _Signal_ had a\nvast army of boys, to whom every year it gave a great _f\u00c3\u00aate_.\nIndeed, the _Signal_ possessed nearly all the available boys, and\nassuredly all the most pugilistic and strongest boys. Mr Myson had\nobtained boys only after persistent inquiry and demand, and such as he\nhad found were not the fittest, and therefore were unlikely to survive.\nYou would have supposed that in a district that never ceases to grumble\nabout bad trade and unemployment, thousands of boys would have been\ndelighted to buy the _Daily_ at fourpence a dozen and sell it at\nsixpence. But it was not so.\n\nOn the second day the dearth of boys at the offices of the _Daily_\nwas painful. There was that magnificent, enterprising newspaper waiting\nto be sold, and there was the great enlightened public waiting to buy;\nand scarcely any business could be done because the _Signal_ boys\nhad established a reign of terror over their puny and upstart rivals!\n\nThe situation was unthinkable.\n\nStill, unthinkable as it was, it continued. Mr Myson had thought of\neverything except this. Naturally it had not occurred to him that an\nimmense and serious effort for the general weal was going to be blocked\nby a gang of tatterdemalions.\n\nHe complained with dignity to the _Signal_, and was informed\nwith dignity by the _Signal_ that the _Signal_ could not be\nresponsible for the playful antics of its boys in the streets; that, in\nshort, the Five Towns was a free country. In the latter proposition Mr\nMyson did not concur.\n\nAfter trouble in the persuasion of parents--astonishing how indifferent\nthe Five Towns' parent was to the loss of blood by his offspring!--a\ncase reached the police-court. At the hearing the _Signal_ gave a\nsolicitor a watching brief, and that solicitor expressed the\n_Signal's_ horror of carnage. The evidence was excessively\ncontradictory, and the Stipendiary dismissed the summons with a good\njoke. The sole definite result was that the boy whose father had\nostensibly brought the summons, got his ear torn within a quarter of an\nhour of leaving the court. Boys will be boys.\n\nStill, the _Daily_ had so little faith in human nature that it\ncould not believe that the _Signal_ was not secretly encouraging\nits boys to be boys. It could not believe that the _Signal_, out of\na sincere desire for fair play and for the highest welfare of the\ndistrict, would willingly sacrifice nearly half its circulation and a\nportion of its advertisement revenue. And the hurt tone of Mr Myson's\nleading articles seemed to indicate that in Mr Myson's opinion his older\nrival _ought_ to do everything in its power to ruin itself. The\n_Signal_ never spoke of the fight. The _Daily_ gave shocking\ndetails of it every day.\n\nThe struggle trailed on through the weeks.\n\nThen Denry had one of his ideas. An advertisement was printed in the\n_Daily_ for two hundred able-bodied men to earn two shillings for\nworking six hours a day. An address different from the address of the\n_Daily_ was given. By a ruse Denry procured the insertion of the\nadvertisement in the _Signal_ also.\n\n\"We must expend our capital on getting the paper on to the streets,\"\nsaid Denry. \"That's evident. We'll have it sold by men. We'll soon see\nif the _Signal_ ragamuffins will attack _them_. And we won't\npay 'em by results; we'll pay 'em a fixed wage; that'll fetch 'em. And a\ncommission on sales into the bargain. Why! I wouldn't mind engaging\n_five_ hundred men. Swamp the streets! That's it! Hang expense. And\nwhen we've done the trick, then we can go back to the boys; they'll have\nlearnt their lesson.\"\n\nAnd Mr Myson agreed and was pleased that Denry was living up to his\nreputation.\n\nThe state of the earthenware trade was supposed that summer to be worse\nthan it had been since 1869, and the grumblings of the unemployed were\nprodigious, even seditious. Mr Myson therefore, as a measure of\nprecaution, engaged a couple of policemen to ensure order at the\naddress, and during the hours, named in the advertisement as a\nrendezvous for respectable men in search of a well-paid job. Having\nregard to the thousands of perishing families in the Five Towns, he\nforesaw a rush and a crush of eager breadwinners. Indeed, the\narrangements were elaborate.\n\nForty minutes after the advertised time for the opening of the reception\nof respectable men in search of money, four men had arrived. Mr Myson,\nmystified, thought that there had been a mistake in the advertisement,\nbut there was no mistake in the advertisement. A little later two more\nmen came. Of the six, three were tipsy, and the other three absolutely\ndeclined to be seen selling papers in the streets. Two were abusive, one\nfacetious. Mr Myson did not know his Five Towns; nor did Denry. A Five\nTowns' man, when he can get neither bread nor beer, will keep himself\nand his family on pride and water. The policemen went off to more\nserious duties.\n\n\nIII\n\nThen came the announcement of the thirty-fifth anniversary of\nthe _Signal_, and of the processional _f\u00c3\u00aate_ by which the\n_Signal_ was at once to give itself a splendid spectacular\nadvertisement and to reward and enhearten its boys. The _Signal_\nmeant to liven up the streets of the Five Towns on that great day by\nmeans of a display of all the gilt chariots of Snape's Circus in the\nmain thoroughfare. Many of the boys would be in the gilt chariots.\nCopies of the anniversary number of the _Signal_ would be sold from\nthe gilt chariots. The idea was excellent, and it showed that after all\nthe _Signal_ was getting just a little more afraid of its young\nrival than it had pretended to be.\n\nFor, strange to say, after a trying period of hesitation, the _Five\nTowns Daily_ was slightly on the upward curve--thanks to Denry. Denry\ndid not mean to be beaten by the puzzle which the _Daily_ offered\nto his intelligence. There the _Daily_ was, full of news, and with\nquite an encouraging show of advertisements, printed on real paper with\nreal ink--and yet it would not \"go.\" Notoriously the _Signal_\nearned a net profit of at the very least five thousand a year, whereas\nthe _Daily_ earned a net loss of at the very least sixty pounds a\nweek--and of that sixty quite a third was Denry's money. He could not\nexplain it. Mr Myson tried to rouse the public by passionately stirring\nup extremely urgent matters--such as the smoke nuisance, the increase of\nthe rates, the park question, German competition, technical education\nfor apprentices; but the public obstinately would not be roused\nconcerning its highest welfare to the point of insisting on a regular\nsupply of the _Daily_. If a mere five thousand souls had positively\ndemanded daily a copy of the _Daily_ and not slept till boys or\nagents had responded to their wish, the troubles of the _Daily_\nwould soon have vanished. But this ridiculous public did not seem to\ncare which paper was put into its hand in exchange for its halfpenny, so\nlong as the sporting news was put there. It simply was indifferent. It\nfailed to see the importance to such an immense district of having two\nflourishing and mutually-opposing daily organs. The fundamental boy\ndifficulty remained ever present.\n\nAnd it was the boy difficulty that Denry perseveringly and ingeniously\nattacked, until at length the _Daily_ did indeed possess some sort\nof a brigade of its own, and the bullying and slaughter in the streets\n(so amusing to the inhabitants) grew a little less one-sided.\n\nA week or more before the _Signal's_ anniversary day, Denry heard\nthat the _Signal_ was secretly afraid lest the _Daily's_\nbrigade might accomplish the marring of its gorgeous procession, and\nthat the _Signal_ was ready to do anything to smash the\n_Daily's_ brigade. He laughed; he said he did not mind. About that\ntime hostilities were rather acute; blood was warming, and both papers,\nin the excitation of rivalry, had partially lost the sense of what was\ndue to the dignity of great organs. By chance a tremendous local\nfootball match--Knype _v_: Bursley--fell on the very Saturday of\nthe procession. The rival arrangements for the reporting of the match\nwere as tremendous as the match itself, and somehow the match seemed to\nadd keenness to the journalistic struggle, especially as the\n_Daily_ favoured Bursley and the _Signal_ was therefore forced\nto favour Knype.\n\nBy all the laws of hazard there ought to have been a hitch on that\nhistoric Saturday. Telephone or telegraph ought to have broken down, or\nrain ought to have made play impossible, but no hitch occurred. And at\nfive-thirty o'clock of a glorious afternoon in earliest November the\n_Daily_ went to press with a truly brilliant account of the manner\nin which Bursley (for the first and last time in its history) had\ndefeated Knype by one goal to none. Mr Myson was proud. Mr Myson defied\nthe _Signal_ to beat his descriptive report. As for the\n_Signal's_ procession--well, Mr Myson and the chief sub-editor of\nthe _Daily_ glanced at each other and smiled.\n\nAnd a few minutes later the _Daily_ boys were rushing out of the\npublishing room with bundles of papers--assuredly in advance of the\n_Signal_.\n\nIt was at this juncture that the unexpected began to occur to the\n_Daily_ boys. The publishing door of the _Daily_ opened into\nStanway Rents, a narrow alley in a maze of mean streets behind Crown\nSquare. In Stanway Rents was a small warehouse in which, according to\nrumours of the afternoon, a free soup kitchen was to be opened. And just\nbefore the football edition of the _Daily_ came off the Marinoni,\nit emphatically was opened, and there issued from its inviting gate an\nodour--not, to be sure, of soup, but of toasted cheese and hot jam--such\nan odour as had never before tempted the nostrils of a _Daily_ boy;\na unique and omnipotent odour. Several boys (who, I may state frankly,\nwere traitors to the _Daily_ cause, spies and mischief-makers from\nelsewhere) raced unhesitatingly in, crying that toasted cheese\nsandwiches and jam tarts were to be distributed like lightning to all\nauthentic newspaper lads.\n\nThe entire gang followed--scores, over a hundred--inwardly expecting to\nemerge instantly with teeth fully employed, followed like sheep into a\nfold.\n\nAnd the gate was shut.\n\nToasted cheese and hot jammy pastry were faithfully served to the ragged\nhost--but with no breathless haste. And when, loaded, the boys struggled\nto depart, they were instructed by the kind philanthropist who had fed\nthem to depart by another exit, and they discovered themselves in an\nenclosed yard, of which the double doors were apparently unyielding. And\nthe warehouse door was shut also. And as the cheese and jam disappeared,\nshouts of fury arose on the air. The yard was so close to the offices of\nthe _Daily_ that the chimneypots of those offices could actually be\nseen. And yet the shouting brought no answer from the lords of the\n_Daily_, congratulating themselves up there on their fine account\nof the football match, and on their celerity in going to press and on\nthe loyalty of their brigade.\n\nThe _Signal_, it need not be said, disavowed complicity in this\nextraordinary entrapping of the _Daily_ brigade by means of an\nodour. Could it be held responsible for the excesses of its\ndisinterested sympathisers?... Still, the appalling trick showed the\nhigh temperature to which blood had risen in the genial battle between\ngreat rival organs. Persons in the inmost ring whispered that Denry\nMachin had at length been bested on this critically important day.\n\n\nIV\n\nSnape's Circus used to be one of the great shining institutions of North\nStaffordshire, trailing its magnificence on sculptured wheels from town\nto town, and occupying the dreams of boys from one generation to\nanother. Its headquarters were at Axe, in the Moorlands, ten miles away\nfrom Hanbridge, but the riches of old Snape had chiefly come from the\nFive Towns. At the time of the struggle between the _Signal_ and\nthe _Daily_ its decline had already begun. The aged proprietor had\nrecently died, and the name, and the horses, and the chariots, and the\ncarefully-repaired tents had been sold to strangers. On the Saturday of\nthe anniversary and the football match (which was also Martinmas\nSaturday) the circus was set up at Oldcastle, on the edge of the Five\nTowns, and was giving its final performances of the season. Even boys\nwill not go to circuses in the middle of a Five Towns' winter. The\n_Signal_ people had hired the processional portion of Snape's for\nthe late afternoon and early evening. And the instructions were that the\nentire _cort\u00c3\u00a8ge_ should be round about the _Signal_ offices,\nin marching order, not later than five o'clock.\n\nBut at four o'clock several gentlemen with rosettes in their\nbutton-holes and _Signal_ posters in their hands arrived important\nand panting at the fair-ground at Oldcastle, and announced that the\nprogramme had been altered at the last moment, in order to defeat\ncertain feared machinations of the unscrupulous _Daily_. The\ncavalcade was to be split into three groups, one of which, the chief,\nwas to enter Hanbridge by a \"back road,\" and the other two were to go to\nBursley and Longshaw respectively. In this manner the forces of\nadvertisement would be distributed, and the chief parts of the district\nequally honoured.\n\nThe special linen banners, pennons, and ribbons--bearing the words--\n\n  \"_SIGNAL:_ THIRTY-FIFTH ANNIVERSARY,\" &c.\n\nhad already been hung and planted and draped about the gilded summits of\nthe chariots. And after some delay the processions were started,\nseparating at the bottom of the Cattle Market. The head of the Hanbridge\npart of the procession consisted of an enormous car of Jupiter, with six\nwheels and thirty-six paregorical figures (as the clown used to say),\nand drawn by six piebald steeds guided by white reins. This coach had a\nwindowed interior (at the greater fairs it sometimes served as a\nbox-office) and in the interior one of the delegates of the\n_Signal_ had fixed himself; from it he directed the paths of the\nprocession.\n\nIt would be futile longer to conceal that the delegate of the\n_Signal_ in the bowels of the car of Jupiter was not honestly a\ndelegate of the _Signal_ at all. He was, indeed, Denry Machin, and\nnone other. From this single fact it will be seen to what extent the\nrepresentatives of great organs had forgotten what was due to their\ndignity and to public decency. Ensconced in his lair Denry directed the\nmain portion of the _Signal's_ advertising procession by all manner\nof discreet lanes round the skirts of Hanbridge and so into the town\nfrom the hilly side. And ultimately the ten vehicles halted in Crapper\nStreet, to the joy of the simple inhabitants.\n\nDenry emerged and wandered innocently towards the offices of his paper,\nwhich were close by. It was getting late. The first yelling of the\nimprisoned _Daily_ boys was just beginning to rise on the autumn\nair.\n\nSuddenly Denry was accosted by a young man.\n\n\"Hello, Machin!\" cried the young man. \"What have you shaved your beard\noff, for? I scarcely knew you.\"\n\n\"I just thought I would, Swetnam,\" said Denry, who was obviously\ndiscomposed.\n\nIt was the youngest of the Swetnam boys; he and Denry had taken a sort\nof curt fancy to one another.\n\n\"I say,\" said Swetnam, confidentially, as if obeying a swift impulse, \"I\ndid hear that the _Signal_ people meant to collar all your chaps\nthis afternoon, and I believe they have done. Hear that now?\" (Swetnam's\nfather was intimate with the _Signal_ people.)\n\n\"I know,\" Denry replied.\n\n\"But I mean--papers and all.\"\n\n\"I know,\" said Denry.\n\n\"Oh!\" murmured Swetnam.\n\n\"But I'll tell you a secret,\" Denry added. \"They aren't to-day's papers.\nThey're yesterday's, and last week's and last month's. We've been\ncollecting them specially and keeping them nice and new-looking.\"\n\n\"Well, you're a caution!\" murmured Swetnam.\n\n\"I am,\" Denry agreed.\n\nA number of men rushed at that instant with bundles of the genuine\nfootball edition from the offices of the _Daily_.\n\n\"Come on!\" Denry cried to them. \"Come on! This way! By-by, Swetnam.\"\n\nAnd the whole file vanished round a corner. The yelling of imprisoned\ncheese-fed boys grew louder.\n\n\nV\n\nIn the meantime at the _Signal_ office (which was not three hundred\nyards away, but on the other side of Crown Square) apprehension had\ndeepened into anxiety as the minutes passed and the Snape Circus\nprocession persisted in not appearing on the horizon of the Oldcastle\nRoad. The _Signal_ would have telephoned to Snape's, but for the\nfact that a circus is never on the telephone. It then telephoned to its\nOldcastle agent, who, after a long delay, was able to reply that the\ncavalcade had left Oldcastle at the appointed hour, with every sign of\nhealth and energy. Then the _Signal_ sent forth scouts all down the\nOldcastle Road to put spurs into the procession, and the scouts\nreturned, having seen nothing. Pessimists glanced at the possibility of\nthe whole procession having fallen into the canal at Cauldon Bridge. The\npaper was printed, the train-parcels for Knype, Longshaw, Bursley, and\nTurnhill were despatched; the boys were waiting; the fingers of the\nclock in the publishing department were simply flying. It had been\narranged that the bulk of the Hanbridge edition, and in particular the\nfirst copies of it, should be sold by boys from the gilt chariots\nthemselves. The publisher hesitated for an awful moment, and then\ndecided that he could wait no more, and that the boys must sell the\npapers in the usual way from the pavements and gutters. There was no\nknowing what the _Daily_ might not be doing.\n\nAnd then _Signal_ boys in dozens rushed forth paper-laden, but they\nwere disappointed boys; they had thought to ride in gilt chariots, not\nto paddle in mud. And almost the first thing they saw in Crown Square\nwas the car of Jupiter in its glory, flying all the _Signal_\ncolours; and other cars behind. They did not rush now; they sprang, as\nfrom a catapult; and alighted like flies on the vehicles. Men insisted\non taking their papers from them and paying for them on the spot. The\nboys were startled; they were entirely puzzled; but they had not the\nhabit of refusing money. And off went the procession to the music of its\nown band down the road to Knype, and perhaps a hundred boys on board,\ncheering. The men in charge then performed a curious act: they tore down\nall the _Signal_ flagging, and replaced it with the emblem of the\n_Daily_.\n\nSo that all the great and enlightened public wandering home in crowds\nfrom the football match at Knype, had the spectacle of a _Daily_\nprocession instead of a _Signal_ procession, and could scarce\nbelieve their eyes. And _Dailys_ were sold in quantities from the\ncars. At Knype Station the procession curved and returned to Hanbridge,\nand finally, after a multitudinous triumph, came to a stand with all its\n_Daily_ bunting in front of the _Signal_ offices; and Denry\nappeared from his lair. Denry's men fled with bundles.\n\n\"They're an hour and a half late,\" said Denry calmly to one of the\nproprietors of the _Signal_, who was on the pavement. \"But I've\nmanaged to get them here. I thought I'd just look in to thank you for\ngiving such a good feed to our lads.\"\n\nThe telephones hummed with news of similar _Daily_ processions in\nLongshaw and Bursley. And there was not a high-class private bar in the\ndistrict that did not tinkle with delighted astonishment at the brazen,\nthe inconceivable effrontery of that card, Denry Machin. Many people\nforesaw law-suits, but it was agreed that the _Signal_ had begun\nthe game of impudence in trapping the _Daily_ lads so as to secure\na holy calm for its much-trumpeted procession.\n\nAnd Denry had not finished with the _Signal_.\n\nIn the special football edition of the _Daily_ was an announcement,\nthe first, of special Martinmas _f\u00c3\u00aates_ organised by the _Five\nTowns Daily_. And on the same morning every member of the Universal\nThrift Club had received an invitation to the said _f\u00c3\u00aates_. They\nwere three--held on public ground at Hanbridge, Bursley, and Longshaw.\nThey were in the style of the usual Five Towns \"wakes\"; that is to say,\nroundabouts, shows, gingerbread stalls, swings, cocoanut shies. But at\neach _f\u00c3\u00aate_ a new and very simple form of \"shy\" had been erected.\nIt consisted of a row of small railway signals.\n\n\"March up! March up!\" cried the shy-men. \"Knock down the signal! Knock\ndown the signal! And a packet of Turkish delight is yours. Knock down\nthe signal!\"\n\nAnd when you had knocked down the signal the men cried:\n\n\"We wrap it up for you in the special Anniversary Number of the\n_Signal_.\"\n\nAnd they disdainfully tore into suitable fragments copies of the\n_Signal_ which had cost Denry & Co. a halfpenny each, and enfolded\nthe Turkish delight therein, and handed it to you with a smack.\n\nAnd all the fair-grounds were carpeted with draggled and muddy\n_Signals_. People were up to the ankles in _Signals_.\n\nThe affair was the talk of Sunday. Few matters in the Five Towns have\nraised more gossip than did that enormous escapade which Denry invented\nand conducted. The moral damage to the _Signal_ was held to\napproach the disastrous. And now not the possibility but the probability\nof law-suits was incessantly discussed.\n\nOn the Monday both papers were bought with anxiety. Everybody was\nfrothing to know what the respective editors would say.\n\nBut in neither sheet was there a single word as to the affair. Both had\ndetermined to be discreet; both were afraid. The _Signal_ feared\nlest it might not, if the pinch came, be able to prove its innocence of\nthe crime of luring boys into confinement by means of toasted cheese and\nhot jam. The _Signal_ had also to consider its seriously damaged\ndignity; for such wounds silence is the best dressing. The _Daily_\nwas comprehensively afraid. It had practically driven its gilded\nchariots through the entire Decalogue. Moreover, it had won easily in\nthe grand altercation. It was exquisitely conscious of glory.\n\nDenry went away to Blackpool, doubtless to grow his beard.\n\nThe proof of the _Daily's_ moral and material victory was that soon\nafterwards there were four applicants, men of substance, for shares in\nthe _Daily_ company. And this, by the way, was the end of the tale.\nFor these applicants, who secured options on a majority of the shares,\nwere emissaries of the _Signal_. Armed with the options, the\n_Signal_ made terms with its rival, and then by mutual agreement\nkilled it. The price of its death was no trifle, but it was less than a\nyear's profits of the _Signal_. Denry considered that he had been\n\"done.\" But in the depths of his heart he was glad that he had been\ndone. He had had too disconcerting a glimpse of the rigours and perils\nof journalism to wish to continue it. He had scored supremely and, for\nhim, to score was life itself. His reputation as a card was far, far\nhigher than ever. Had he so desired, he could have been elected to the\nHouse of Commons on the strength of his procession and _f\u00c3\u00aate_.\n\nMr Myson, somewhat scandalised by the exuberance of his partner,\nreturned to Manchester.\n\nAnd the _Signal_, subsequently often referred to as \"The Old Lady,\"\nresumed its monopolistic sway over the opinions of a quarter of a\nmillion of people, and has never since been attacked.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nHIS INFAMY\n\n\nI\n\nWhen Denry at a single stroke \"wherreted\" his mother and proved his\nadventurous spirit by becoming the possessor of one of the first\nmotor-cars ever owned in Bursley, his instinct naturally was to run up\nto Councillor Cotterill's in it. Not that he loved Councillor Cotterill,\nand therefore wished to make him a partaker in his joy; for he did not\nlove Councillor Cotterill. He had never been able to forgive Nellie's\nfather for those patronising airs years and years before at Llandudno,\nairs indeed which had not even yet disappeared from Cotterill's attitude\ntowards Denry. Though they were Councillors on the same Town Council,\nthough Denry was getting richer and Cotterill was assuredly not getting\nricher, the latter's face and tone always seemed to be saying to Denry:\n\"Well, you are not doing so badly for a beginner.\" So Denry did not care\nto lose an opportunity of impressing Councillor Cotterill. Moreover,\nDenry had other reasons for going up to the Cotterills. There existed a\nsympathetic bond between him and Mrs Cotterill, despite her prim\ntaciturnity and her exasperating habit of sitting with her hands pressed\ntight against her body and one over the other. Occasionally he teased\nher--and she liked being teased. He had glimpses now and then of her\nsecret soul; he was perhaps the only person in Bursley thus privileged.\nThen there was Nellie. Denry and Nellie were great friends. For the rest\nof the world she had grown up, but not for Denry, who treated her as the\nchocolate child; while she, if she called him anything, called him\nrespectfully \"Mr.\"\n\nThe Cotterills had a fairly large old house with a good garden \"up\nBycars Lane,\" above the new park and above all those red streets which\nMr Cotterill had helped to bring into being. Mr Cotterill built new\nhouses with terra-cotta facings for others, but preferred an old one in\nstucco for himself. His abode had been saved from the parcelling out of\nseveral Georgian estates. It was dignified. It had a double entrance\ngate, and from this portal the drive started off for the house door, but\ndeliberately avoided reaching the house door until it had wandered in\ncurves over the entire garden. That was the Georgian touch! The modern\ntouch was shown in Councillor Cotterill's bay windows, bath-room and\ngarden squirter. There was stabling, in which were kept a Victorian\ndogcart and a Georgian horse, used by the Councillor in his business. As\nsure as ever his wife or daughter wanted the dogcart, it was either out\nor just going out, or the Georgian horse was fatigued and needed repose.\nThe man who groomed the Georgian also ploughed the flowerbeds, broke the\nwindows in cleaning them, and put blacking on brown boots. Two indoor\nservants had differing views as to the frontier between the kingdom of\nhis duties and the kingdom of theirs, in fact, it was the usual spacious\nhousehold of successful trade in a provincial town.\n\nDenry got to Bycars Lane without a breakdown. This was in the days,\nquite thirteen years ago, when automobilists made their wills and took\nfood supplies when setting forth. Hence Denry was pleased. The small but\nuseful fund of prudence in him, however, forbade him to run the car\nalong the unending sinuous drive. The May night was fine, and he left\nthe loved vehicle with his new furs in the shadow of a monkey-tree near\nthe gate.\n\nAs he was crunching towards the door, he had a beautiful idea: \"I'll\ntake 'em all out for a spin. There'll just be room!\" he said.\n\nNow even to-day, when the very cabman drives his automobile, a man who\nbuys a motor cannot say to a friend: \"I've bought a motor. Come for a\nspin,\" in the same self-unconscious accents as he would say: \"I've\nbought a boat. Come for a sail,\" or \"I've bought a house. Come and look\nat it.\" Even to-day and in the centre of London there is still something\nabout a motor--well something.... Everybody who has bought a motor, and\neverybody who has dreamed of buying a motor, will comprehend me. Useless\nto feign that a motor is the most banal thing imaginable. It is not. It\nremains the supreme symbol of swagger. If such is the effect of a motor\nin these days and in Berkeley Square, what must it have been in that dim\npast, and in that dim town three hours by the fastest express from\nEuston? The imagination must be forced to the task of answering this\nquestion. Then will it be understood that Denry was simply tingling with\npride.\n\n\"Master in?\" he demanded of the servant, who was correctly starched, but\nunkempt in detail.\n\n\"No, sir. He ain't been in for tea.\"\n\n(\"I shall take the women out then,\" said Denry to himself.)\n\n\"Come in! Come in!\" cried a voice from the other side of the open door\nof the drawing-room, Nellie's voice! The manners and state of a family\nthat has industrially risen combine the spectacular grandeur of the\ncaste to which it has climbed with the ease and freedom of the caste\nwhich it has quitted.\n\n\"Such a surprise!\" said the voice. Nellie appeared, rosy.\n\nDenry threw his new motoring cap hastily on to the hall-stand. No! He\ndid not hope that Nellie would see it. He hoped that she would not see\nit. Now that the moment was really come to declare himself the owner of\na motor-car, he grew timid and nervous. He would have liked to hide his\nhat. But then Denry was quite different from our common humanity. He was\ncapable even of feeling awkward in a new suit of clothes. A singular\nperson.\n\n\"Hello!\" she greeted him.\n\n\"Hello!\" he greeted her.\n\nTheir hands touched.\n\n\"Father hasn't come yet,\" she added. He fancied she was not quite at\nease.\n\n\"Well,\" he said, \"what's this surprise.\"\n\nShe motioned him into the drawing-room.\n\nThe surprise was a wonderful woman, brilliant in black--not black silk,\nbut a softer, delicate stuff. She reclined in an easy-chair with\nsurpassing grace and self-possession. A black Egyptian shawl, spangled\nwith silver, was slipping off her shoulders. Her hair was dressed--that\nis to say, it was _dressed_; it was obviously and thrillingly a\nwork of elaborate art. He could see her two feet and one of her ankles.\nThe boots, the open-work stocking--such boots, such an open-work\nstocking, had never been seen in Bursley, not even at a ball! She was in\nmourning, and wore scarcely any jewellery, but there was a gleaming tint\nof gold here and there among the black, which resulted in a marvellous\neffect of richness.\n\nThe least experienced would have said, and said rightly: \"This must be a\nwoman of wealth and fashion.\" It was the detail that finished the\ndemonstration. The detail was incredible. There might have been ten\nmillion stitches in the dress. Ten sempstresses might have worked on the\ndress for ten years. An examination of it under a microscope could but\nhave deepened one's amazement at it.\n\nShe was something new in the Five Towns, something quite new.\n\nDenry was not equal to the situation. He seldom was equal to a small\nsituation. And although he had latterly acquired a considerable amount\nof social _savoir_, he was constantly mislaying it, so that he\ncould not put his hand on it at the moment when he most required it, as\nnow.\n\n\"Well, Denry!\" said the wondrous creature in black, softly.\n\nAnd he collected himself as though for a plunge, and said:\n\n\"Well, Ruth!\"\n\nThis was the woman whom he had once loved, kissed, and engaged himself\nto marry. He was relieved that she had begun with Christian names,\nbecause he could not recall her surname. He could not even remember\nwhether he had ever heard it. All he knew was that, after leaving\nBursley to join her father in Birmingham, she had married somebody with\na double name, somebody well off, somebody older than herself; somebody\napparently of high social standing; and that this somebody had died.\n\nShe made no fuss. There was no implication in her demeanour that she\nexpected to be wept over as a lone widow, or that because she and he had\non a time been betrothed, therefore they could never speak naturally to\neach other again. She just talked as if nothing had ever happened to\nher, and as if about twenty-four hours had elapsed since she had last\nseen him. He felt that she must have picked up this most useful\ndiplomatic calmness in her contacts with her late husband's class. It\nwas a valuable lesson to him: \"Always behave as if nothing had happened\n--no matter what has happened.\"\n\nTo himself he was saying:\n\n\"I'm glad I came up in my motor.\"\n\nHe seemed to need something in self-defence against the sudden attack of\nall this wealth and all this superior social tact, and the motor-car\nserved excellently.\n\n\"I've been hearing a great deal about you lately,\" said she with a soft\nsmile, unobtrusively rearranging a fold of her skirt.\n\n\"Well,\" he replied, \"I'm sorry I can't say the same of you.\"\n\nSlightly perilous perhaps, but still he thought it rather neat.\n\n\"Oh!\" she said. \"You see I've been so much out of England. We were just\ntalking about holidays. I was saying to Mrs Cotterill they certainly\nought to go to Switzerland this year for a change.\"\n\n\"Yes, Mrs Capron-Smith was just saying--\" Mrs Cotterill put in.\n\n(So that was her name.)\n\n\"It would be something too lovely!\" said Nellie in ecstasy.\n\nSwitzerland! Astonishing how with a single word she had marked the gulf\nbetween Bursley people and herself. The Cotterills had never been out of\nEngland. Not merely that, but the Cotterills had never dreamt of going\nout of England. Denry had once been to Dieppe, and had come back as\nthough from Timbuctoo with a traveller's renown. And she talked of\nSwitzerland easily!\n\n\"I suppose it is very jolly,\" he said.\n\n\"Yes,\" she said, \"it's splendid in summer. But, of course, _the_\ntime is winter, for the sports. Naturally, when you aren't free to take\na bit of a holiday in winter, you must be content with summer, and very\nsplendid it is. I'm sure you'd enjoy it frightfully, Nell.\"\n\n\"I'm sure I should--frightfully!\" Nellie agreed. \"I shall speak to\nfather. I shall make him--\"\n\n\"Now, Nellie--\" her mother warned her.\n\n\"Yes, I shall, mother,\" Nellie insisted.\n\n\"There _is_ your father!\" observed Mrs Cotterill, after listening.\n\nFootsteps crossed the hall, and died away into the dining-room.\n\n\"I wonder why on earth father doesn't come in here. He must have heard\nus talking,\" said Nellie, like a tyrant crossed in some trifle.\n\nA bell rang, and then the servant came into the drawing-room and\nremarked: \"If you please, mum,\" at Mrs Cotterill, and Mrs Cotterill\ndisappeared, closing the door after her.\n\n\"What are they up to, between them?\" Nellie demanded, and she, too,\ndeparted, with wrinkled brow, leaving Denry and Ruth together. It could\nbe perceived on Nellie's brow that her father was going \"to catch it.\"\n\n\"I haven't seen Mr Cotterill yet,\" said Mrs Capron-Smith.\n\n\"When did you come?\" Denry asked.\n\n\"Only this afternoon.\"\n\nShe continued to talk.\n\nAs he looked at her, listening and responding intelligently now and\nthen, he saw that Mrs Capron-Smith was in truth the woman that Ruth had\nso cleverly imitated ten years before. The imitation had deceived him\nthen; he had accepted it for genuine. It would not have deceived him\nnow--he knew that. Oh yes! This was the real article that could hold its\nown anywhere.... Switzerland! And not simply Switzerland, but a\nrefinement on Switzerland! Switzerland in winter! He divined that in her\nopinion Switzerland in summer was not worth doing--in the way of\ncorrectness. But in winter...\n\n\nII\n\nNellie had announced a surprise for Denry as he entered the house, but\nNellie's surprise for Denry, startling and successful though it proved,\nwas as naught to the surprise which Mr Cotterill had in hand for Nellie,\nher mother, Denry, the town of Bursley, and various persons up and down\nthe country.\n\nMrs Cotterill came hysterically in upon the duologue between Denry and\nRuth in the drawing-room. From the activity of her hands, which, instead\nof being decently folded one over the other, were waving round her head\nin the strangest way, it was clear that Mrs Cotterill was indeed under\nthe stress of a very unusual emotion.\n\n\"It's those creditors--at last! I knew it would be! It's all those\ncreditors! They won't let him alone, and now they've _done_ it.\"\n\nSo Mrs Cotterill! She dropped into a chair. She had no longer any sense\nof shame, of what was due to her dignity. She seemed to have forgotten\nthat certain matters are not proper to be discussed in drawing-rooms.\nShe had left the room Mrs Councillor Cotterill; she returned to it\nnobody in particular, the personification of defeat. The change had\noperated in five minutes.\n\nMrs Capron-Smith and Denry glanced at each other, and even Mrs\nCapron-Smith was at a loss for a moment. Then Ruth approached Mrs\nCotterill and took her hand. Perhaps Mrs Capron-Smith was not so\nastonished after all. She and Nellie's mother had always been \"very\nfriendly.\" And in the Five Towns \"very friendly\" means a lot.\n\n\"Perhaps if you were to leave us,\" Ruth suggested, twisting her head to\nglance at Denry.\n\nIt was exactly what he desired to do. There could be no doubt that Ruth\nwas supremely a woman of the world. Her tact was faultless.\n\nHe left them, saying to himself: \"Well, here's a go!\"\n\nIn the hall, through an open door, he saw Councillor Cotterill standing\nagainst the dining-room mantelpiece.\n\nWhen Cotterill caught sight of Denry he straightened himself into a\ncertain uneasy perkiness.\n\n\"Young man,\" he said in a counterfeit of his old patronising tone, \"come\nin here. You may as well hear about it. You're a friend of ours. Come in\nand shut the door.\"\n\nNellie was not in view.\n\nDenry went in and shut the door.\n\n\"Sit down,\" said Cotterill.\n\nAnd it was just as if he had said: \"Now, you're a fairly bright sort of\nyouth, and you haven't done so badly in life; and as a reward I mean to\nadmit you to the privilege of hearing about our ill-luck, which for some\nmysterious reason reflects more credit on me than your good luck\nreflects on you, young man.\"\n\nAnd he stroked his straggling grey beard.\n\n\"I'm going to file my petition to-morrow,\" said he, and gave a short\nlaugh.\n\n\"Really!\" said Denry, who could think of nothing else to say. His name\nwas not Capron-Smith.\n\n\"Yes; they won't leave me any alternative,\" said Mr Cotterill.\n\nThen he gave a brief history of his late commercial career to the young\nman. And he seemed to figure it as a sort of tug-of-war between his\ncreditors and his debtors, he himself being the rope. He seemed to imply\nthat he had always done his sincere best to attain the greatest good of\nthe greatest number, but that those wrong-headed creditors had\nconsistently thwarted him.\n\nHowever, he bore them no grudge. It was the fortune of the tug-of-war.\nHe pretended, with shabby magnificence of spirit, that a bankruptcy at\nthe age of near sixty, in a community where one has cut a figure, is a\nmere passing episode.\n\n\"Are you surprised?\" he asked foolishly, with a sheepish smile.\n\nDenry took vengeance for all the patronage that he had received during a\ndecade.\n\n\"No!\" he said. \"Are you?\"\n\nInstead of kicking Denry out of the house for an impudent young\njackanapes, Mr Cotterill simply resumed his sheepish smile.\n\nDenry had been surprised for a moment, but he had quickly recovered.\nCotterill's downfall was one of those events which any person of acute\nintelligence can foretell after they have happened. Cotterill had run\nthe risks of the speculative builder, built and mortgaged, built and\nmortgaged, sold at a profit, sold without profit, sold at a loss, and\nfailed to sell; given bills, second mortgages, and third mortgages; and\nbecause he was a builder and could do nothing but build, he had\ncontinued to build in defiance of Bursley's lack of enthusiasm for his\nerections. If rich gold deposits had been discovered in Bursley\nMunicipal Park, Cotterill would have owned a mining camp and amassed\nimmense wealth; but unfortunately gold deposits were not discovered in\nthe Park. Nobody knew his position; nobody ever does know the position\nof a speculative builder. He did not know it himself. There had been\nrumours, but they had been contradicted in an adequate way. His recent\nrefusal of the mayoral chain, due to lack of spare coin, had been\nattributed to prudence. His domestic existence had always been conducted\non the same moderately lavish scale. He had always paid the baker, the\nbutcher, the tailor, the dressmaker.\n\nAnd now he was to file his petition in bankruptcy, and to-morrow the\nentire town would have \"been seeing it coming\" for years.\n\n\"What shall you do?\" Denry inquired in amicable curiosity.\n\n\"Well,\" said Cotterill, \"that's the point. I've got a brother a builder\nin Toronto, you know. He's doing very well; building _is_ building\nover there. I wrote to him a bit since, and he replied by the next mail\n--by the next mail--that what he wanted was just a man like me to\noverlook things. He's getting an old man now, is John. So, you see,\nthere's an opening waiting for me.\"\n\nAs if to say, \"The righteous are never forsaken.\"\n\n\"I tell you all this as you're a friend of the family like,\" he added.\n\nThen, after an expanse of vagueness, he began hopefully, cheerfully,\nundauntedly:\n\n\"Even _now_ if I could get hold of a couple of thousand I could\npull through handsome--and there's plenty of security for it.\"\n\n\"Bit late now, isn't it?\"\n\n\"Not it. If only some one who really knows the town, and has faith in\nthe property market, would come down with a couple of thousand--well, he\nmight double it in five years.\"\n\n\"Really!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Cotterill. \"Look at Clare Street.\"\n\nClare Street was one of his terra-cotta masterpieces.\n\n\"You, now,\" said Cotterill, insinuating. \"I don't expect anyone can\nteach _you_ much about the value o' property in this town. You know\nas well as I do. If you happened to have a couple of thousand loose--by\ngosh! it's a chance in a million.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Denry. \"I should say that was just about what it was.\"\n\n\"I put it before you,\" Cotterill proceeded, gathering way, and missing\nthe flavour of Denry's remark. \"Because you're a friend of the family.\nYou're so often here. Why, it's pretty near ten years....\"\n\nDenry sighed: \"I expect I come and see you all about once a fortnight\nfairly regular. That makes two hundred and fifty times in ten years.\nYes....\"\n\n\"A couple of thou',\" said Cotterill, reflectively.\n\n\"Two hundred and fifty into two thousand--eight. Eight pounds a visit. A\nshade thick, Cotterill, a shade thick. You might be half a dozen\nfashionable physicians rolled into one.\"\n\nNever before had he called the Councillor \"Cotterill\" unadorned. Me\nCotterill flushed and rose.\n\nDenry does not appear to advantage in this interview. He failed in\nmagnanimity. The only excuse that can be offered for him is that Mr\nCotterill had called him \"young man\" once or twice too often in the\ncourse of ten years. It is subtle.\n\n\nIII\n\n\"No,\" whispered Ruth, in all her wraps. \"Don't bring it up to the door.\nI'll walk down with you to the gate, and get in there.\"\n\nHe nodded.\n\nThey were off, together. Ruth, it had appeared, was actually staying at\nthe Five Towns Hotel at Knype, which at that epoch was the only hotel in\nthe Five Towns seriously pretending to be \"first-class\" in the full-page\nadvertisement sense. The fact that Ruth was staying at the Five Towns\nHotel impressed Denry anew. Assuredly she did things in the grand\nmanner. She had meant to walk down by the Park to Bursley Station and\ncatch the last loop-line train to Knype, and when Denry suddenly\ndisclosed the existence of his motor-car, and proposed to see her to her\nhotel in it, she in her turn had been impressed. The astonishment in her\ntone as she exclaimed: \"Have you got a _motor_?\" was the least in\nthe world na\u00c3\u00afve.\n\nThus they departed together from the stricken house, Ruth saying\nbrightly to Nellie, who had reappeared in a painful state of\ndemoralisation, that she should return on the morrow.\n\nAnd Denry went down the obscure drive with a final vision of the poor\nchild, Nellie, as she stood at the door to speed them. It was\nextraordinary how that child had remained a child. He knew that she must\nbe more than half-way through her twenties, and yet she persisted in\nbeing the merest girl. A delightful little thing; but no _savoir\nvivre_, no equality to a situation, no spectacular pride. Just a\nnice, bright girl, strangely girlish.... The Cotterills had managed that\nbad evening badly. They had shown no dignity, no reserve, no discretion;\nand old Cotterill had been simply fatuous in his suggestion. As for Mrs\nCotterill, she was completely overcome, and it was due solely to Ruth's\ncalm, managing influence that Nellie, nervous and whimpering, had wound\nherself up to come and shut the front door after the guests.\n\nIt was all very sad.\n\nWhen he had successfully started the car, and they were sliding down the\nMoorthorne hill together, side by side, their shoulders touching, Denry\nthrew off the nightmarish effect of the bankrupt household. After all,\nthere was no reason why he should be depressed. He was not a bankrupt.\nHe was steadily adding riches to riches. He acquired wealth mechanically\nnow. Owing to the habits of his mother, he never came within miles of\nliving up to his income. And Ruth--she, too, was wealthy. He felt that\nshe must be wealthy in the strict significance of the term. And she\ncompleted wealth by experience of the world. She was his equal. She\nunderstood things in general. She had lived, travelled, suffered,\nreflected--in short, she was a completed article of manufacture. She was\nno little, clinging, raw girl. Further, she was less hard than of yore.\nHer voice and gestures had a different quality. The world had softened\nher. And it occurred to him suddenly that her sole fault--extravagance--\nhad no importance now that she was wealthy.\n\nHe told her all that Mr Cotterill had said about Canada. And she told\nhim all that Mrs Cotterill had said about Canada. And they agreed that\nMr Cotterill had got his deserts, and that, in its own interest, Canada\nwas the only thing for the Cotterill family; and the sooner the better.\nPeople must accept the consequences of bankruptcy. Nothing could be\ndone.\n\n\"I think it's a pity Nellie should have to go,\" said Denry.\n\n\"Oh! _Do_ you?\" replied Ruth.\n\n\"Yes; going out to a strange country like that. She's not what you may\ncall the Canadian kind of girl. If she could only get something to do\nhere. ...If something could be found for her.\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't agree with you at _all_,\" said Ruth. \"Do you really\nthink she ought to leave her parents just _now_? Her place is with\nher parents. And besides, between you and me, she'll have a much better\nchance of marrying there than in _this_ town--after all this. Of\ncourse I shall be very sorry to lose her--and Mrs Cotterill, too.\nBut....\"\n\n\"I expect you're right,\" Denry concurred.\n\nAnd they sped on luxuriously through the lamp-lit night of the Five\nTowns. And Denry pointed out his house as they passed it. And they both\nthought much of the security of their positions in the world, and of\ntheir incomes, and of the honeyed deference of their bankers; and also\nof the mistake of being a failure.... You could do nothing with a\nfailure.\n\n\nIV\n\nOn a frosty morning in early winter you might have seen them together in\na different vehicle--a first-class compartment of the express from Knype\nto Liverpool. They had the compartment to themselves, and they were\ninstalled therein with every circumstance of luxury. Both were enwrapped\nin furs, and a fur rug united their knees in its shelter. Magazines and\nnewspapers were scattered about to the value of a labourer's hire for a\nwhole day; and when Denry's eye met the guard's it said \"shilling.\" In\nshort, nobody could possibly be more superb than they were on that\nmorning in that compartment.\n\nThe journey was the result of peculiar events.\n\nMr Cotterill had made himself a bankrupt, and cast away the robe of a\nTown Councillor. He had submitted to the inquisitiveness of the Official\nReceiver, and to the harsh prying of those rampant baying beasts, his\ncreditors. He had laid bare his books, his correspondence, his lack of\nmethod, his domestic extravagance, and the distressing fact that he had\ncontinued to trade long after he knew himself to be insolvent. He had\nfor several months, in the interests of the said beasts, carried on his\nown business as manager at a nominal salary. And gradually everything\nthat was his had been sold. And during the final weeks the Cotterill\nfamily had been obliged to quit their dismantled house and exist in\nlodgings. It had been arranged that they should go to Canada by way of\nLiverpool, and on the day before the journey of Denry and Ruth to\nLiverpool they had departed from the borough of Bursley (which Mr\nCotterill had so extensively faced with terra-cotta) unhonoured and\nunsung. Even Denry, though he had visited them in their lodgings to say\ngood-bye, had not seen them off at the station; but Ruth Capron-Smith\nhad seen them off at the station. She had interrupted a sojourn to\nSouthport in order to come to Bursley, and despatch them therefrom with\ndue friendliness. Certain matters had to be attended to after their\ndeparture, and Ruth had promised to attend to them.\n\nNow immediately after seeing them off Ruth had met Denry in the street.\n\n\"Do you know,\" she said brusquely, \"those people are actually going\nsteerage? I'd no idea of it. Mr and Mrs Cotterill kept it from me, and I\nshould not have heard of it only from something Nellie said. That's why\nthey've gone to-day. The boat doesn't sail till to-morrow afternoon.\"\n\n\"Steerage?\" and Denry whistled.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Ruth. \"Nothing but pride, of course. Old Cotterill wanted to\nhave every penny he could scrape, so as to be able to make the least\ntiny bit of a show when he gets to Toronto, and so--steerage! Just think\nof Mrs Cotterill and Nellie in the steerage. If I'd known of it I should\nhave altered that, I can tell you, and pretty quickly too; and now it's\ntoo late.\"\n\n\"No, it isn't,\" Denry contradicted her flatly.\n\n\"But they've gone.\"\n\n\"I could telegraph to Liverpool for saloon berths--there's bound to be\nplenty at this time of year--and I could run over to Liverpool to-morrow\nand catch 'em on the boat, and make 'em change.\"\n\nShe asked him whether he really thought he could, and he assured her.\n\n\"Second-cabin berths would be better,\" said she.\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Well, because of dressing for dinner, and so on. They haven't got the\nclothes, you know.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" said Denry.\n\n\"Listen,\" she said, with an enchanting smile. \"Let's halve the cost, you\nand I. And let's go to Liverpool together, and--er--make the little\ngift, and arrange things. I'm leaving for Southport to-morrow, and\nLiverpool's on my way.\"\n\nDenry was delighted by the suggestion, and telegraphed to Liverpool with\nsuccess.\n\nThus they found themselves on that morning in the Liverpool express\ntogether. The work of benevolence in which they were engaged had a\npowerful influence on their mood, which grew both intimate and tender.\nRuth made no concealment of her regard for Denry; and as he gazed across\nthe compartment at her, exquisitely mature (she was slightly older than\nhimself), dressed to a marvel, perfect in every detail of manner,\nknowing all that was to be known about life, and secure in a handsome\nfortune--as he gazed, Denry reflected, joyously, victoriously:\n\n\"I've got the dibs, of course. But she's got 'em too--perhaps more.\nTherefore she must like me for myself alone. This brilliant creature has\nbeen everywhere and seen everything, and she comes back to the Five\nTowns and comes back to _me_.\"\n\nIt was his proudest moment. And in it he saw his future far more\nglorious than he had dreamt.\n\n\"When shall you be out of mourning?\" he inquired.\n\n\"In two months,\" said she.\n\nThis was not a proposal and acceptance, but it was very nearly one. They\nwere silent, and happy.\n\nThen she said:\n\n\"Do you ever have business at Southport?\"\n\nAnd he said, in a unique manner:\n\n\"I shall have.\"\n\nAnother silence. This time he felt he _would_ marry her.\n\n\nV\n\nThe White Star liner, _Titubic_, stuck out of the water like a row\nof houses against the landing-stage. There was a large crowd on her\npromenade-deck, and a still larger crowd on the landing-stage. Above the\npromenade-deck officers paced on the navigating deck, and above that was\nthe airy bridge, and above that the funnels, smoking, and somewhere\nstill higher a flag or two fluttering in the icy breeze. And behind the\ncrowd on the landing-stage stretched a row of four-wheeled cabs and\nrickety horses. The landing-stage swayed ever so slightly on the tide.\nOnly the ship was apparently solid, apparently cemented in foundations\nof concrete.\n\nOn the starboard side of the promenade-deck, among a hundred other small\ngroups, was a group consisting of Mr and Mrs Cotterill and Ruth and\nDenry. Nellie stood a few feet apart, Mrs Cotterill was crying. People\nnaturally thought she was crying because of the adieux; but she was not.\nShe wept because Denry and Ruth, by sheer force of will, had compelled\nthem to come out of the steerage and occupy beautiful and commodious\nberths in the second cabin, where the manner of the stewards was quite\ndifferent. She wept because they had been caught in the steerage. She\nwept because she was ashamed, and because people were too kind. She was\nat once delighted and desolated. She wanted to outpour psalms of\ngratitude, and also she wanted to curse.\n\nMr Cotterill said stiffly that he should repay--and that soon.\n\nAn immense bell sounded impatiently.\n\n\"We'd better be shunting,\" said Denry. \"That's the second.\"\n\nIn exciting crises he sometimes employed such peculiar language as this.\nAnd he was very excited. He had done a great deal of rushing about. The\nupraising of the Cotterill family from the social Hades of the steerage\nto the respectability of the second cabin had demanded all his energy,\nand a lot of Ruth's.\n\nRuth kissed Mrs Cotterill and then Nellie. And Mrs Cotterill and Nellie\nacquired rank and importance for the whole voyage by reason of being\nkissed in public by a woman so elegant and aristocratic as Ruth\nCapron-Smith.\n\nAnd Denry shook hands. He looked brightly at the parents, but he could\nnot look at Nellie; nor could she look at him; their handshaking was\nperfunctory. For months their playful intimacy had been in abeyance.\n\n\"Good-bye.\"\n\n\"Good luck.\"\n\n\"Thanks. Good-bye.\"\n\n\"Good-bye.\"\n\nThe horrible bell continued to insist.\n\n\"All non-passengers ashore! All ashore!\"\n\nThe numerous gangways were thronged with people obeying the call, and\nhandkerchiefs began to wave. And there was a regular vibrating tremor\nthrough the ship.\n\nMr and Mrs Cotterill turned away.\n\nRuth and Denry approached the nearest gangway, and Denry stood aside,\nand made a place for her to pass. And, as always, a number of women\npushed into the gangways immediately after her, and Denry had to wait,\nbeing a perfect gentleman.\n\nHis eye caught Nellie's. She had not moved.\n\nHe felt then as he had never felt in his life. No, absolutely never. Her\nsad, her tragic glance rendered him so uncomfortable, and yet so\ndeliciously uncomfortable, that the symptoms startled him. He wondered\nwhat would happen to his legs. He was not sure that he had legs.\n\nHowever, he demonstrated the existence of his legs by running up to\nNellie. Ruth was by this time swallowed in the crowd on the\nlanding-stage. He looked at Nellie. Nellie looked at him. Her lips\ntwitched.\n\n\"What am I doing here?\" he asked of his soul.\n\nShe was not at all well dressed. She was indeed shabby--in a steerage\nstyle. Her hat was awry; her gloves miserable. No girlish pride in her\ndistraught face. No determination to overcome Fate. No consciousness of\nability to meet a bad situation. Just those sad eyes and those twitching\nlips.\n\n\"Look here,\" Denry whispered, \"you must come ashore for a second. I've\nsomething I want to give you, and I've left it in the cab.\"\n\n\"But there's no time. The bell's...\"\n\n\"Bosh!\" he exclaimed gruffly, extinguishing her timid, childish voice.\n\"You won't go for at least a quarter of an hour. All that's only a dodge\nto get people off in plenty of time. Come on, I tell you.\"\n\nAnd in a sort of hysteria he seized her thin, long hand and dragged her\nalong the deck to another gangway, down whose steep slope they stumbled\ntogether. The crowd of sightseers and handkerchief-wavers jostled them.\nThey could see nothing but heads and shoulders, and the great side of\nthe ship rising above. Denry turned her back on the ship.\n\n\"This way.\" He still held her hand.\n\nHe struggled to the cab-rank.\n\n\"Which one is it?\" she asked.\n\n\"Any one. Never mind which. Jump in.\" And to the first driver whose eye\nmet his, he said: \"Lime Street Station.\"\n\nThe gangways were being drawn away. A hoarse boom filled the air, and\nthen a cheer.\n\n\"But I shall miss the boat,\" the dazed girl protested.\n\n\"Jump in.\"\n\nHe pushed her in.\n\n\"But I shall miss the...\"\n\n\"I know you will,\" he replied, as if angrily. \"Do you suppose I was\ngoing to let you go by that steamer? Not much.\"\n\n\"But mother and father...\"\n\n\"I'll telegraph. They'll get it on landing.\"\n\n\"And where's Ruth?\"\n\n\"_Be hanged to Ruth!_\" he shouted furiously.\n\nAs the cab rattled over the cobbles the _Titubic_ slipped away from\nthe landing-stage. The irretrievable had happened.\n\nNellie burst into tears.\n\n\"Look here,\" Denry said savagely. \"If you don't dry up, I shall have to\ncry myself.\"\n\n\"What are you going to do with me?\" she whimpered.\n\n\"Well, what do _you_ think? I'm going to marry you, of course.\"\n\nHis aggrieved tone might have been supposed to imply that people had\ntried to thwart him, but that he had no intention of being thwarted, nor\nof asking permissions, nor of conducting himself as anything but a\nfierce tyrant.\n\nAs for Nellie, she seemed to surrender.\n\nThen he kissed her--also angrily. He kissed her several times--yes, even\nin Lord Street itself--less and less angrily.\n\n\"Where are you taking me to?\" she inquired humbly, as a captive.\n\n\"I shall take you to my mother's,\" he said.\n\n\"Will she like it?\"\n\n\"She'll either like it or lump it,\" said Denry. \"It'll take a\nfortnight.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"The notice, and things.\"\n\nIn the train, in the midst of a great submissive silence, she murmured:\n\n\"It'll be simply awful for father and mother.\"\n\n\"That can't be helped,\" said he. \"And they'll be far too sea-sick to\nbother their heads about you.\"\n\n\"You can't think how you've staggered me,\" said she.\n\n\"You can't think how I've staggered myself,\" said he.\n\n\"When did you decide to...\"\n\n\"When I was standing at the gangway, and you looked at me,\" he answered.\n\n\"But...\"\n\n\"It's no use butting,\" he said. \"I'm like that.... That's me, that is.\"\n\nIt was the bare truth that he had staggered himself. But he had\nstaggered himself into a miraculous, ecstatic happiness. She had no\nmoney, no clothes, no style, no experience, no particular gifts. But she\nwas she. And when he looked at her, calmed, he knew that he had done\nwell for himself. He knew that if he had not yielded to that terrific\nimpulse he would have done badly for himself. Mrs Machin had what she\ncalled a ticklish night of it.\n\n\nVI\n\nThe next day he received a note from Ruth, dated Southport, inquiring\nhow he came to lose her on the landing-stage, and expressing concern. It\ntook him three days to reply, and even then the reply was a bad one. He\nhad behaved infamously to Ruth; so much could not be denied. Within\nthree hours of practically proposing to her, he had run off with a\nsimple girl, who was not fit to hold a candle to her. And he did not\ncare. That was the worst of it; he did not care.\n\nOf course the facts reached her. The facts reached everybody; for the\nsingular reappearance of Nellie in the streets of Bursley immediately\nafter her departure for Canada had to be explained. Moreover, the\ninfamous Denry was rather proud of the facts. And the town inevitably\nsaid: \"Machin all over, that! Snatching the girl off the blooming\nlugger. Machin all over.\" And Denry agreed privately that it was Machin\nall over.\n\n\"What other chap,\" he demanded of the air, \"would have thought of it? Or\nhad the pluck?...\"\n\nIt was mere malice on the part of destiny that caused Denry to run\nacross Mrs Capron-Smith at Euston some weeks later. Happily they both\nhad immense nerve.\n\n\"Dear me,\" said she. \"What are _you_ doing here?\"\n\n\"Only honeymooning,\" he said.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nIN THE ALPS\n\n\nI\n\nAlthough Denry was extremely happy as a bridegroom, and capable of the\nmost foolish symptoms of affection in private, he said to himself, and\nhe said to Nellie (and she sturdily agreed with him): \"We aren't going\nto be the ordinary silly honeymooners.\" By which, of course, he meant\nthat they would behave so as to be taken for staid married persons. They\nfailed thoroughly in this enterprise as far as London, where they spent\na couple of nights, but on leaving Charing Cross they made a new and a\nbetter start, in the light of experience.\n\nTheir destination, it need hardly be said, was Switzerland. After Mrs\nCapron-Smith's remarks on the necessity of going to Switzerland in\nwinter if one wished to respect one's self, there was really no\nalternative to Switzerland. Thus it was announced in the _Signal_\n(which had reported the wedding in ten lines, owing to the excessive\nquietude of the wedding) that Mr and Mrs Councillor Machin were spending\na month at Mont Pridoux, sur Montreux, on the Lake of Geneva. And the\nannouncement looked very well.\n\nAt Dieppe they got a through carriage. There were several through\ncarriages for Switzerland on the train. In walking through the corridors\nfrom one to another Denry and Nellie had their first glimpse of the\nworld which travels and which runs off for a holiday whenever it feels\nin the mood. The idea of going for a holiday in any month but August\nseemed odd to both of them. Denry was very bold and would insist on\ntalking in a naturally loud voice. Nellie was timid and clinging. \"What\ndo you say?\" Denry would roar at her when she half-whispered something,\nand she had to repeat it so that all could hear. It was part of their\nplan to address each other curtly, brusquely, and to frown, and to\npretend to be slightly bored by each other.\n\nThey were outclassed by the world which travels. Try as they might, even\nDenry was morally intimidated. He had managed his clothes fairly\ncorrectly; he was not ashamed of them; and Nellie's were by no means the\nworst in the compartments; indeed, according to the standard of some of\nthe most intimidating women, Nellie's costume erred in not being quite\nsufficiently negligent, sufficiently \"anyhow.\" And they had plenty, and\nten times plenty of money, and the consciousness of it. Expense was not\nbeing spared on that honeymoon. And yet.... Well, all that can be said\nis that the company was imposing. The company, which was entirely\nEnglish, seemed to be unaware that any one ever did anything else but\ntravel luxuriously to places mentioned in second-year geographies. It\nastounded Nellie that there should be so many people in the world with\nnothing to do but spend. And they were constantly saying the strangest\nthings with an air of perfect calm.\n\n\"How much did you pay for the excess luggage?\" an untidy young woman\nasked of an old man.\n\n\"Oh! Thirteen pounds,\" answered the old man, carelessly.\n\nAnd not long before Nellie had scarcely escaped ten days in the steerage\nof an Atlantic liner.\n\nAfter dinner in the restaurant car--no champagne, because it was vulgar,\nbut a good sound, expensive wine--they felt more equal to the situation,\nmore like part-owners of the train. Nellie prudently went to bed ere the\ntriumphant feeling wore off. But Denry stayed up smoking in the\ncorridor. He stayed up very late, being too proud and happy and too avid\nof new sensations to be able to think of sleep. It was a match which led\nto a conversation between himself and a thin, drawling, overbearing\nfellow with an eyeglass. Denry had hated this lordly creature all the\nway from Dieppe. In presenting him with a match he felt that he was\nsomehow getting the better of him, for the match was precious in the\nnocturnal solitude of the vibrating corridor. The mere fact that two\npeople are alone together and awake, divided from a sleeping or sleepy\npopulation only by a row of closed, mysterious doors, will do much to\nbreak down social barriers. The excellence of Denry's cigar also helped.\nIt atoned for the breadth of his accent.\n\nHe said to himself:\n\n\"I'll have a bit of a chat with this johnny.\"\n\nAnd then he said aloud:\n\n\"Not a bad train this!\"\n\n\"No!\" the eyeglass agreed languidly. \"Pity they give you such a beastly\ndinner!\"\n\nAnd Denry agreed hastily that it was.\n\nSoon they were chatting of places, and somehow it came out of Denry that\nhe was going to Montreux. The eyeglass professed its indifference to\nMontreux in winter, but said the resorts above Montreux were all right,\nsuch as Caux or Pridoux.\n\nAnd Denry said:\n\n\"Well, of course, shouldn't think of stopping _in_ Montreux. Going\nto try Pridoux.\"\n\nThe eyeglass said it wasn't going so far as Switzerland yet; it meant to\nstop in the Jura.\n\n\"Geneva's a pretty deadly place, ain't it?\" said the eyeglass after a\npause.\n\n\"Ye-es,\" said Denry.\n\n\"Been there since that new esplanade was finished?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Denry. \"I saw nothing of it.\"\n\n\"When were you there?\"\n\n\"Oh! A couple of years ago.\"\n\n\"Ah! It wasn't started then. Comic thing! Of course they're awfully\nproud in Geneva of the view of Mont Blanc.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Denry.\n\n\"Ever noticed how queer women are about that view? They're no end keen\non it at first, but after a day or two it gets on their nerves.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Denry. \"I've noticed that myself. My wife....\"\n\nHe stopped, because he didn't know what he was going to say. The\neyeglass nodded understandingly.\n\n\"All alike,\" it said. \"Odd thing!\"\n\nWhen Denry introduced himself into the two-berth compartment which he\nhad managed to secure at the end of the carriage for himself and Nellie,\nthe poor tired child was as wakeful as an owl.\n\n\"Who have you been talking to?\" she yawned.\n\n\"The eyeglass johnny.\"\n\n\"Oh! Really,\" Nellie murmured, interested and impressed. \"With him, have\nyou? I could hear voices. What sort of a man is he?\"\n\n\"He seems to be an ass,\" said Denry. \"Fearfully haw-haw. Couldn't stand\nhim for long. I've made him believe we've been married for two years.\"\n\n\nII\n\nThey stood on the balcony of the H\u00c3\u00b4tel Beau-Site of Mont Pridoux. A\nlittle below, to the right, was the other hotel, the M\u00c3\u00a9tropole, with the\nred-and-white Swiss flag waving over its central tower. A little below\nthat was the terminal station of the funicular railway from Montreux.\nThe railway ran down the sheer of the mountain into the roofs of\nMontreux, like a wire. On it, two toy trains crawled towards each other,\nlike flies climbing and descending a wall. Beyond the fringe of hotels\nthat constituted Montreux was a strip of water, and beyond the water a\nrange of hills white at the top.\n\n\"So these are the Alps!\" Nellie exclaimed.\n\nShe was disappointed; he also. But when Denry learnt from the guide-book\nand by inquiry that the strip of lake was seven miles across, and the\nhighest notched peaks ten thousand feet above the sea and twenty-five\nmiles off, Nellie gasped and was content.\n\nThey liked the H\u00c3\u00b4tel Beau-Site. It had been recommended to Denry, by a\nman who knew what was what, as the best hotel in Switzerland. \"Don't you\nbe misled by prices,\" the man had said. And Denry was not. He paid\nsixteen francs a day for the two of them at the Beau-Site, and was\nrather relieved than otherwise by the absence of finger-bowls.\nEverything was very good, except sometimes the hot water. The hot-water\ncans bore the legend \"hot water,\" but these two words were occasionally\nthe only evidence of heat in the water. On the other hand, the bedrooms\ncould be made sultry by merely turning a handle; and the windows were\ndouble. Nellie was wondrously inventive. They breakfasted in bed, and\nshe would save butter and honey from the breakfast to furnish forth\nafternoon tea, which was not included in the terms. She served the\nbutter freshly with ice by the simple expedient of leaving it outside\nthe window of a night. And Denry was struck by this house-wifery.\n\nThe other guests appeared to be of a comfortable, companionable class,\nwith, as Denry said, \"no frills.\" They were amazed to learn that a\nchattering little woman of thirty-five, who gossiped with everybody, and\nsoon invited Denry and Nellie to have tea in her room, was an authentic\nRussian Countess, inscribed in the visitors' lists as \"Comtesse Ruhl\n(with maid), Moscow.\" Her room was the untidiest that Nellie had ever\nseen, and the tea a picnic. Still, it was thrilling to have had tea with\na Russian Countess.... (Plots! Nihilism! Secret police! Marble\npalaces!).... Those visitors' lists were breath-taking. Pages and pages\nof them; scores of hotels, thousands of names, nearly all English--and\nall people who came to Switzerland in winter, having naught else to do.\nDenry and Nellie bathed in correctness as in a bath.\n\nThe only persons in the hotel with whom they did not \"get on\" nor \"hit\nit off\" were a military party, chiefly named Clutterbuck, and presided\nover by a Major Clutterbuck and his wife. They sat at a large table in a\ncorner--father, mother, several children, a sister-in-law, a sister, a\ngoverness--eight heads in all; and while utterly polite they seemed to\ndraw a ring round themselves. They grumbled at the hotel; they played\nbridge (then a newish game); and once, when Denry and the Countess\nplayed with them (Denry being an adept card-player) for shilling points,\nDenry overheard the sister-in-law say that she was sure Captain Deverax\nwouldn't play for shilling points. This was the first rumour of the\nexistence of Captain Deverax; but afterwards Captain Deverax began to be\nmentioned several times a day. Captain Deverax was coming to join them,\nand it seemed that he was a very particular man. Soon all the rest of\nthe hotel had got its back up against this arriving Captain Deverax.\nThen a Clutterbuck cousin came, a smiling, hard, fluffy woman, and\npronounced definitely that the H\u00c3\u00b4tel Beau-Site would never do for\nCaptain Deverax. This cousin aroused Denry's hostility in a strange way.\nShe imparted to the Countess (who united all sects) her opinion that\nDenry and Nellie were on their honeymoon. At night in a corner of the\ndrawing-room the Countess delicately but bluntly asked Nellie if she had\nbeen married long. \"No,\" said Nellie. \"A month?\" asked the Countess,\nsmiling. \"N-no,\" said Nellie.\n\nThe next day all the hotel knew. The vast edifice of make-believe that\nDenry and Nellie had laboriously erected crumbled at a word, and they\nstood forth, those two, blushing for the criminals they were.\n\nThe hotel was delighted. There is more rejoicing in a hotel over one\nhoneymoon couple than over fifty families with children.\n\nBut the hotel had a shock the same day. The Clutterbuck cousin had\nproclaimed that owing to the inadequacy of the bedroom furniture she had\nbeen obliged to employ a sofa as a wardrobe. Then there were more\nreferences to Captain Deverax. And then at dinner it became known--\nHeaven knows how!--that the entire Clutterbuck party had given notice\nand was seceding to the Hotel M\u00c3\u00a9tropole. Also they had tried to carry\nthe Countess with them, but had failed.\n\nNow, among the guests of the H\u00c3\u00b4tel Beau-Site there had always been a\nprofessed scorn of the rival Hotel M\u00c3\u00a9tropole, which was a franc a day\ndearer, and famous for its new and rich furniture. The M\u00c3\u00a9tropole had an\norchestra twice a week, and the English Church services were held in its\ndrawing-room; and it was larger than the Beau-Site. In spite of these\nfacts the clients of the Beau-Site affected to despise it, saying that\nthe food was inferior and that the guests were snobbish. It was an\narticle of faith in the Beau-Site that the Beau-Site was the best hotel\non the mountain-side, if not in Switzerland.\n\nThe insolence of this defection on the part of the Clutterbucks! How on\nearth _could_ people have the face to go to a landlord and say to\nhim that they meant to desert him in favour of his rival?\n\nAnother detail: the secession of nine or ten people from one hotel to\nthe other meant that the M\u00c3\u00a9tropole would decidedly be more populous than\nthe Beau-Site, and on the point of numbers the emulation was very keen.\n\"Well,\" said the Beau-Site, \"let 'em go! With their Captain Deverax! We\nshall be better without 'em!\" And that deadliest of all feuds sprang up\n--a rivalry between the guests of rival hotels. The M\u00c3\u00a9tropole had issued\na general invitation to a dance, and after the monstrous conduct of the\nClutterbucks the question arose whether the Beau-Site should not boycott\nthe dance. However, it was settled that the truly effective course would\nbe to go with critical noses in the air, and emit unfavourable\ncomparisons with the Beau-Site. The Beau-Site suddenly became perfect in\nthe esteem of its patrons. Not another word was heard on the subject of\nhot water being coated with ice. And the Clutterbucks, with incredible\nassurance, slid their luggage off in a sleigh to the M\u00c3\u00a9tropole, in the\nfull light of day, amid the contempt of the faithful.\n\n\nIII\n\nUnder the stars the dancing section of the Beau-Site went off in\njingling sleighs over the snow to the ball at the M\u00c3\u00a9tropole. The\ndistance was not great, but it was great enough to show the inadequacy\nof furs against twenty degrees of mountain frost, and it was also great\nenough to allow the party to come to a general final understanding that\nits demeanour must be cold and critical in the gilded halls of the\nM\u00c3\u00a9tropole. The rumour ran that Captain Deverax had arrived, and every\none agreed that he must be an insufferable booby, except the Countess\nRuhl, who never used her fluent exotic English to say ill of anybody.\n\nThe gilded halls of the M\u00c3\u00a9tropole certainly were imposing. The hotel was\nincontestably larger than the Beau-Site, newer, more richly furnished.\nIts occupants, too, had a lordly way with them, trying to others, but\ninimitable. Hence the visitors from the Beau-Site, as they moved to and\nfro beneath those crystal chandeliers from Tottenham Court Road, had\ntheir work cut out to maintain the mien of haughty indifference. Nellie,\nfor instance, frankly could not do it. And Denry did not do it very\nwell. Denry, nevertheless, did score one point over Mrs Clutterbuck's\nfussy cousin.\n\n\"Captain Deverax has come,\" said this latter. \"He was very late. He'll\nbe downstairs in a few minutes. We shall get him to lead the cotillon.\"\n\n\"Captain Deverax?\" Denry questioned.\n\n\"Yes. You've heard us mention him,\" said the cousin, affronted.\n\n\"Possibly,\" said Denry. \"I don't remember.\"\n\nOn hearing this brief colloquy the cohorts of the Beau-Site felt that in\nDenry they possessed the making of a champion.\n\nThere was a disturbing surprise, however, waiting for Denry.\n\nThe lift descended; and with a peculiar double action of his arms on the\ndoors, like a pantomime fairy emerging from an enchanted castle, a tall\nthin man stepped elegantly out of the lift and approached the company\nwith a certain mincingness. But before he could reach the company\nseveral young women had rushed towards him, as though with the intention\nof committing suicide by hanging themselves from his neck. He was in an\nevening suit so perfect in detail that it might have sustained\ncomparison with the costume of the head waiter. And he wore an eyeglass\nin his left eye. It was the eyeglass that made Denry jump. For two\nseconds he dismissed the notion.... But another two seconds of\nexamination showed beyond doubt that this eyeglass was the eyeglass of\nthe train. And Denry had apprehensions....\n\n\"Captain Deverax!\" exclaimed several voices.\n\nThe manner in which the youthful and the mature fair clustered around\nthis Captain, aged forty (and not handsome) was really extraordinary, to\nthe males of the H\u00c3\u00b4tel Beau-Site. Even the little Russian Countess\nattached herself to him at once. And by reason of her title, her social\nenergy, and her personal distinction, she took natural precedence of the\nothers.\n\n\"Recognise him?\" Denry whispered to his wife.\n\nNellie nodded. \"He seems rather nice,\" she said diffidently.\n\n\"Nice!\" Denry repeated the adjective. \"The man's an ass!\"\n\nAnd the majority of the Beau-Site party agreed with Denry's verdict\neither by word or gesture.\n\nCaptain Deverax stared fixedly at Denry; then smiled vaguely and\ndrawled, \"Hullo! How d' do?\"\n\nAnd they shook hands.\n\n\"So you know him?\" some one murmured to Denry.\n\n\"Know him?... Since infancy.\"\n\nThe inquirer scented facetiousness, but he was somehow impressed. The\nremarkable thing was that though he regarded Captain Deverax as a\npopinjay, he could not help feeling a certain slight satisfaction in the\nfact that they were in some sort acquaintances.... Mystery of the human\nheart!... He wished sincerely that he had not, in his conversation with\nthe Captain in the train, talked about previous visits to Switzerland.\nIt was dangerous.\n\nThe dance achieved that brightness and joviality which entitle a dance\nto call itself a success. The cotillon reached brilliance, owing to the\ncaptaincy of Captain Deverax. Several score opprobrious epithets were\napplied to the Captain in the course of the night, but it was agreed\n_nemine contradicente_ that, whatever he would have done in front\nof a Light Brigade at Balaclava, as a leader of cotillons he was\nterrific. Many men, however, seemed to argue that if a man who\n_was_ a man led a cotillon, he ought not to lead it too well, on\npain of being considered a cox-comb.\n\nAt the close, during the hot soup, the worst happened. Denry had known\nthat it would.\n\nCaptain Deverax was talking to Nellie, who was respectfully listening,\nabout the scenery, when the Countess came up, plate in hand.\n\n\"No, no,\" the Countess protested. \"As for me, I hate your mountains. I\nwas born in the steppe where it is all level--level! Your mountains\nclose me in. I am only here by order of my doctor. Your mountains get on\nmy nerves.\" She shrugged her shoulders.\n\nCaptain Deverax smiled.\n\n\"It is the same with you, isn't it?\" he said turning to Nellie.\n\n\"Oh, no,\" said Nellie, simply.\n\n\"But your husband told me the other day that when you and he were in\nGeneva a couple of years ago, the view of Mont Blanc used to--er--upset\nyou.\"\n\n\"View of Mont Blanc?\" Nellie stammered.\n\nEverybody was aware that she and Denry had never been in Switzerland\nbefore, and that their marriage was indeed less than a month old.\n\n\"You misunderstood me,\" said Denry, gruffly. \"My wife hasn't been to\nGeneva.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" drawled Captain Deverax.\n\nHis \"Oh!\" contained so much of insinuation, disdain, and lofty amusement\nthat Denry blushed, and when Nellie saw her husband's cheek she blushed\nin competition and defeated him easily. It was felt that either Denry\nhad been romancing to the Captain, or that he had been married before,\nunknown to his Nellie, and had been \"carrying on\" at Geneva. The\nsituation, though it dissolved of itself in a brief space, was awkward.\nIt discredited the H\u00c3\u00b4tel Beau-Site. It was in the nature of a repulse\nfor the H\u00c3\u00b4tel Beau-Site (franc a day cheaper than the M\u00c3\u00a9tropole) and of\na triumph for the popinjay. The fault was utterly Denry's. Yet he said\nto himself:\n\n\"I'll be even with that chap.\"\n\nOn the drive home he was silent. The theme of conversation in the\nsleighs which did not contain the Countess was that the Captain had\nflirted tremendously with the Countess, and that it amounted to an\naffair.\n\n\nIV\n\nCaptain Deverax was equally salient in the department of sports. There\nwas a fair sheet of ice, obtained by cutting into the side of the\nmountain, and a very good tobogganing track, about half a mile in length\nand full of fine curves, common to the two hotels. Denry's predilection\nwas for the track. He would lie on his stomach on the little contrivance\nwhich the Swiss call a luge, and which consists of naught but three bits\nof wood and two steel-clad runners, and would course down the perilous\ncurves at twenty miles an hour. Until the Captain came, this was\nregarded as dashing, because most people were content to sit on the luge\nand travel legs-foremost instead of head-foremost. But the Captain,\nafter a few eights on the ice, intimated that for the rest no sport was\ntrue sport save the sport of ski-running. He allowed it to be understood\nthat luges were for infants. He had brought his skis, and these\ninstruments of locomotion, some six feet in length, made a sensation\namong the inexperienced. For when he had strapped them to his feet the\nCaptain, while stating candidly that his skill was as nothing to that of\nthe Swedish professionals at St Moritz, could assuredly slide over snow\nin manner prodigious and beautiful. And he was exquisitely clothed for\nthe part. His knickerbockers, in the elegance of their lines, were the\ndelight of beholders. Ski-ing became the rage. Even Nellie insisted on\nhiring a pair. And the pronunciation of the word \"ski\" aroused long\ndiscussions and was never definitely settled by anybody. The Captain\nsaid \"skee,\" but he did not object to \"shee,\" which was said to be the\nmore strictly correct by a lady who knew some one who had been to\nNorway. People with no shame and no feeling for correctness said\nbrazenly, \"sky.\" Denry, whom nothing could induce to desert his luge,\nsaid that obviously \"s-k-i\" could only spell \"planks.\" And thanks to his\ninspiration this version was adopted by the majority.\n\nOn the second day of Nellie's struggle with her skis she had more\nsuccess than she either anticipated or desired. She had been making\nexperiments at the summit of the track, slithering about, falling, and\nbeing restored to uprightness by as many persons as happened to be near.\nSkis seemed to her to be the most ungovernable and least practical means\nof travel that the madness of man had ever concocted. Skates were\nwell-behaved old horses compared to these long, untamed fiends, and a\nluge was like a tricycle. Then suddenly a friendly starting push drove\nher a yard or two, and she glided past the level on to the first\nimperceptible slope of the track. By some hazard her two planks were\nexactly parallel, as they ought to be, and she glided forward\nmiraculously. And people heard her say:\n\n\"How lovely!\"\n\nAnd then people heard her say:\n\n\"Oh!... Oh!\"\n\nFor her pace was increasing. And she dared not strike her pole into the\nground. She had, in fact, no control whatever over those two planks to\nwhich her feet were strapped. She might have been Mazeppa and they\nmustangs. She could not even fall. So she fled down the preliminary\nstraight of the track, and ecstatic spectators cried: \"Look how\n_well_ Mrs Machin is doing!\"\n\nMrs Machin would have given all her furs to be anywhere off those\nplanks. On the adjacent fields of glittering snow the Captain had been\ngiving his adored Countess a lesson in the use of skis; and they stood\ntogether, the Countess somewhat insecure, by the side of the track at\nits first curve.\n\nNellie, dumb with excitement and amazement, swept towards them.\n\n\"Look out!\" cried the Captain.\n\nIn vain! He himself might perhaps have escaped, but he could not abandon\nhis Countess in the moment of peril, and the Countess could only move\nafter much thought and many efforts, being scarce more advanced than\nNellie. Nellie's wilful planks quite ignored the curve, and, as it were\nafloat on them, she charged off the track, and into the Captain and the\nCountess. The impact was tremendous. Six skis waved like semaphores in\nthe air. Then all was still. Then, as the beholders hastened to the\nscene of the disaster, the Countess laughed and Nellie laughed. The\nlaugh of the Captain was not heard. The sole casualty was a wound about\na foot long in the hinterland of the Captain's unique knicker-bockers.\nAnd as threads of that beautiful check pattern were afterwards found\nattached to the wheel of Nellie's pole, the cause of the wound was\nindisputable. The Captain departed home, chiefly backwards, but with\ngreat rapidity.\n\nIn the afternoon Denry went down to Montreux and returned with an opal\nbracelet, which Nellie wore at dinner.\n\n\"Oh! What a ripping bracelet!\" said a girl.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Nellie. \"My husband gave it me only to-day.\"\n\n\"I suppose it's your birthday or something,\" the inquisitive girl\nventured.\n\n\"No,\" said Nellie.\n\n\"How nice of him!\" said the girl.\n\nThe next day Captain Deverax appeared in riding breeches. They were not\ncorrect for ski-running, but they were the best he could do. He visited\na tailor's in Montreux.\n\n\nV\n\nThe Countess Ruhl had a large sleigh of her own, also a horse; both were\nhired from Montreux. In this vehicle, sometimes alone, sometimes with a\nmale servant, she would drive at Russian speed over the undulating\nmountain roads; and for such expeditions she always wore a large red\ncloak with a hood. Often she was thus seen, in the afternoon; the\nscarlet made a bright moving patch on the vast expanses of snow. Once,\nat some distance from the village, two tale-tellers observed a man on\nskis careering in the neighbourhood of the sleigh. It was Captain\nDeverax. The flirtation, therefore, was growing warmer and warmer. The\nhotels hummed with the tidings of it. But the Countess never said\nanything; nor could anything be extracted from her by even the most\nexperienced gossips. She was an agreeable but a mysterious woman, as\nbefitted a Russian Countess. Again and again were she and the Captain\nseen together afar off in the landscape. Certainly it was a novelty in\nflirtations. People wondered what might happen between the two at the\nfancy-dress ball which the H\u00c3\u00b4tel Beau-Site was to give in return for the\nhospitality of the H\u00c3\u00b4tel M\u00c3\u00a9tropole. The ball was offered not in love,\nbut in emulation, almost in hate; for the jealousy displayed by the\nBeau-Site against the increasing insolence of the M\u00c3\u00a9tropole had become\nacute. The airs of the Captain and his lieges, the Clutterbuck party,\nhad reached the limit of the Beau-Site's endurance. The M\u00c3\u00a9tropole seemed\nto take it for granted that the Captain would lead the cotillon at the\nBeau-Site's ball as he had led it at the M\u00c3\u00a9tropole's.\n\nAnd then, on the very afternoon of the ball, the Countess received a\ntelegram--it was said from St Petersburg--which necessitated her instant\ndeparture. And she went, in an hour, down to Montreux by the funicular\nrailway, and was lost to the Beau-Site. This was a blow to the prestige\nof the Beau-Site. For the Countess was its chief star, and, moreover,\nmuch loved by her fellow-guests, despite her curious weakness for the\npopinjay, and the mystery of her outings with him.\n\nIn the stables Denry saw the Countess's hired sleigh and horse, and in\nthe sleigh her glowing red cloak. And he had one of his ideas, which he\nexecuted, although snow was beginning to fall. In ten minutes he and\nNellie were driving forth, and Nellie in the red cloak held the reins.\nDenry, in a coachman's furs, sat behind. They whirled past the H\u00c3\u00b4tel\nM\u00c3\u00a9tropole. And shortly afterwards, on the wild road towards Attalens,\nDenry saw a pair of skis scudding as quickly as skis can scud in their\nrear. It was astonishing how the sleigh, with all the merry jingle of\nits bells, kept that pair of skis at a distance of about a hundred\nyards. It seemed to invite the skis to overtake it, and then to regret\nthe invitation and flee further. Up the hills it would crawl, for the\nskis climbed slowly. Down them it galloped, for the skis slid on the\nslopes at a dizzy pace. Occasionally a shout came from the skis. And the\nsnow fell thicker and thicker. So for four or five miles. Starlight\ncommenced. Then the road made a huge descending curve round a hollowed\nmeadow, and the horse galloped its best. But the skis, making a straight\nline down the snow, acquired the speed of an express, and gained on the\nsleigh one yard in every three. At the bottom, where the curve met the\nstraight line, was a farmhouse and outbuildings and a hedge and a stone\nwall and other matters. The sleigh arrived at the point first, but only\nby a trifle. \"Mind your toes,\" Denry muttered to himself, meaning an\ninjunction to the skis, whose toes were three feet long. The skis,\nthrough the eddying snow, yelled frantically to the sleigh to give room.\nThe skis shot up into the road, and in swerving aside swerved into a\nsnow-laden hedge, and clean over it into the farmyard, where they stuck\nthemselves up in the air, as skis will when the person to whose feet\nthey are attached is lying prone. The door of the farm opened and a\nwoman appeared.\n\nShe saw the skis at her doorstep. She heard the sleigh-bells, but the\nsleigh had already vanished into the dusk.\n\n\"Well, that was a bit of a lark, that was, Countess!\" said Denry to\nNellie. \"That will be something to talk about. We'd better drive home\nthrough Corsier, and quick too! It'll be quite dark soon.\"\n\n\"Supposing he's dead!\" Nellie breathed, aghast, reining in the horse.\n\n\"Not he!\" said Denry. \"I saw him beginning to sit up.\"\n\n\"But how will he get home?\"\n\n\"It looks a very nice farmhouse,\" said Denry. \"I should think he'd be\nsorry to leave it.\"\n\n\nVI\n\nWhen Denry entered the dining-room of the Beau-Site, which had been\ncleared for the ball, his costume drew attention not so much by its\nsplendour or ingenuity as by its peculiarity. He wore a short\nChinese-shaped jacket, which his wife had made out of blue linen, and a\nflat Chinese hat to match, which they had constructed together on a\nbasis of cardboard. But his thighs were enclosed in a pair of absurdly\nample riding-breeches of an impressive check and cut to a comic\nexaggeration of the English pattern. He had bought the cloth for these\nat the tailor's in Montreux. Below them were very tight leggings, also\nEnglish. In reply to a question as to what or whom he supposed himself\nto represent, he replied:\n\n\"A Captain of Chinese cavalry, of course.\"\n\nAnd he put an eyeglass into his left eye and stared.\n\nNow it had been understood that Nellie was to appear as Lady Jane Grey.\nBut she appeared as Little Red Riding-Hood, wearing over her frock the\nforgotten cloak of the Countess Ruhl.\n\nInstantly he saw her, Denry hurried towards her, with a movement of the\nlegs and a flourish of the eyeglass in his left hand which powerfully\nsuggested a figure familiar to every member of the company. There was\nlaughter. People saw that the idea was immensely funny and clever, and\nthe laughter ran about like fire. At the same time some persons were not\nquite sure whether Denry had not lapsed a little from the finest taste\nin this caricature. And all of them were secretly afraid that the\nuncomfortable might happen when Captain Deverax arrived.\n\nHowever, Captain Deverax did not arrive. The party from the M\u00c3\u00a9tropole\ncame with the news that he had not been seen at the hotel for dinner; it\nwas assumed that he had been to Montreux and missed the funicular back.\n\n\"Our two stars simultaneously eclipsed!\" said Denry, as the Clutterbucks\n(representing all the history of England) stared at him curiously.\n\n\"Why?\" exclaimed the Clutterbuck cousin, \"who's the other?\"\n\n\"The Countess,\" said Denry. \"She went this afternoon--three o'clock.\"\n\nAnd all the M\u00c3\u00a9tropole party fell into grief.\n\n\"It's a world of coincidences,\" said Denry, with emphasis.\n\n\"You don't mean to insinuate,\" said Mrs Clutterbuck, with a nervous\nlaugh, \"that Captain Deverax has--er--gone after the Countess?\"\n\n\"Oh no!\" said Denry, with unction. \"Such a thought never entered my\nhead.\"\n\n\"I think you're a very strange man, Mr Machin,\" retorted Mrs\nClutterbuck, hostile and not a bit reassured. \"May one ask what that\ncostume is supposed to be?\"\n\n\"A Captain of Chinese cavalry,\" said Denry, lifting his eyeglass.\n\nNevertheless, the dance was a remarkable success, and little by little\neven the sternest adherents of the absent Captain Deverax deigned to be\namused by Denry's Chinese gestures. Also, Denry led the cotillon, and\nwas thereafter greatly applauded by the Beau-Site. The visitors agreed\namong themselves that, considering that his name was not Deverax, Denry\nacquitted himself honourably. Later he went to the bureau, and,\nreturning, whispered to his wife:\n\n\"It's all right. He's come back safe.\"\n\n\"How do you know?\"\n\n\"I've just telephoned to ask.\"\n\nDenry's subsequent humour was wildly gay. And for some reason which\nnobody could comprehend, he put a sling round his left arm. His efforts\nto insert the eyeglass into his left eye with his right hand were\ninsistently ludicrous and became a sure source of laughter for all\nbeholders. When the M\u00c3\u00a9tropole party were getting into their sleighs to\ngo home--it had ceased snowing--Denry was still trying to insert his\neyeglass into his left eye with his right hand, to the universal joy.\n\n\nVII\n\nBut the joy of the night was feeble in comparison with the violent joy\nof the next morning. Denry was wandering, apparently aimless, between\nthe finish of the tobogganing track and the portals of the M\u00c3\u00a9tropole.\nThe snowfall had repaired the defects of the worn track, but it needed\nto be flattened down by use, and a number of conscientious \"lugeurs\"\nwere flattening it by frequent descents, which grew faster at each\nrepetition. Other holiday-makers were idling about in the sunshine. A\npage-boy of the M\u00c3\u00a9tropole departed in the direction of the Beau-Site\nwith a note.\n\nAt length--the hour was nearing eleven--Captain Deverax, languid, put\nhis head out of the M\u00c3\u00a9tropole and sniffed the air. Finding the air\nsufferable, he came forth on to the steps. His left arm was in a sling.\nHe was wearing the new knickerbockers which he had ordered at Montreux,\nand which were of precisely the same vast check as had ornamented\nDenry's legs on the previous night.\n\n\"Hullo!\" said Denry, sympathetically. \"What's this?\"\n\nThe Captain needed sympathy.\n\n\"Ski-ing yesterday afternoon,\" said he, with a little laugh. \"Hasn't the\nCountess told any of you?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Denry, \"not a word.\"\n\nThe Captain seemed to pause a moment.\n\n\"Yes,\" said he. \"A trifling accident. I was ski-ing with the Countess.\nThat is, I was ski-ing and she was in her sleigh.\"\n\n\"Then this is why you didn't turn up at the dance?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said the Captain.\n\n\"Well,\" said Denry, \"I hope it's not serious. I can tell you one thing,\nthe cotillon was a most fearful frost without you.\" The Captain seemed\ngrateful.\n\nThey strolled together toward the track.\n\nThe first group of people that caught sight of the Captain with his\nchecked legs and his arm in a sling began to smile. Observing this\nsmile, and fancying himself deceived, the Captain attempted to put his\neyeglass into his left eye with his right hand, and regularly failed.\nHis efforts towards this feat changed the smiles to enormous laughter.\n\n\"I daresay it's awfully funny,\" said he. \"But what can a fellow do with\none arm in a sling?\"\n\nThe laughter was merely intensified. And the group, growing as luge\nafter luge arrived at the end of the track, seemed to give itself up to\nmirth, to the exclusion of even a proper curiosity about the nature of\nthe Captain's damage. Each fresh attempt to put the eyeglass to his eye\nwas coal on the crackling fire. The Clutterbucks alone seemed glum.\n\n\"What on earth is the joke?\" Denry asked primly. \"Captain Deverax came\nto grief late yesterday afternoon, ski-ing with the Countess Ruhl.\nThat's why he didn't turn up last night. By the way, where was it,\nCaptain?\"\n\n\"On the mountain, near Attalens,\" Deverax answered gloomily. \"Happily\nthere was a farmhouse near--it was almost dark.\"\n\n\"With the Countess?\" demanded a young impulsive schoolgirl.\n\n\"You did say the Countess, didn't you?\" Denry asked.\n\n\"Why, certainly,\" said the Captain, testily.\n\n\"Well,\" said the schoolgirl with the nonchalant thoughtless cruelty of\nyouth, \"considering that we all saw the Countess off in the funicular at\nthree o'clock, I don't see how you could have been ski-ing with her when\nit was nearly dark.\" And the child turned up the hill with her luge,\nleaving her elders to unknot the situation.\n\n\"Oh, yes!\" said Denry. \"I forgot to tell you that the Countess left\nyesterday after lunch.\"\n\nAt the same moment the page-boy, reappearing, touched his cap and placed\na note in the Captain's only free hand.\n\n\"Couldn't deliver it, sir. The Comtesse left early yesterday afternoon.\"\n\nConvicted of imaginary adventure with noble ladies, the Captain made his\nretreat, muttering, back to the hotel. At lunch Denry related the exact\ncircumstances to a delighted table, and the exact circumstances soon\nreached the Clutterbuck faction at the M\u00c3\u00a9tropole. On the following day\nthe Clutterbuck faction and Captain Deverax (now fully enlightened) left\nMont Pridoux for some paradise unknown. If murderous thoughts could\nkill, Denry would have lain dead. But he survived to go with about half\nthe Beau-Site guests to the funicular station to wish the Clutterbucks a\npleasant journey. The Captain might have challenged him to a duel but a\nhaughty and icy ceremoniousness was deemed the best treatment for Denry.\n\"Never show a wound\" must have been the Captain's motto.\n\nThe Beau-Site had scored effectively. And, now that its rival had lost\neleven clients by one single train, it beat the M\u00c3\u00a9tropole even in vulgar\nnumbers.\n\nDenry had an embryo of a conscience somewhere, and Nellie's was fully\ndeveloped.\n\n\"Well,\" said Denry, in reply to Nellie's conscience, \"it serves him\nright for making me look a fool over that Geneva business. And besides,\nI can't stand uppishness, and I won't. I'm from the Five Towns, I am.\"\n\nUpon which singular utterance the incident closed.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nTHE SUPREME HONOUR\n\n\nI\n\nDenry was not as regular in his goings and comings as the generality of\nbusiness men in the Five Towns; no doubt because he was not by nature a\nbusiness man at all, but an adventurous spirit who happened to be in a\nbusiness which was much too good to leave. He was continually, as they\nsay there, \"up to something\" that caused changes in daily habits.\nMoreover, the Universal Thrift Club (Limited) was so automatic and\nself-winding that Denry ran no risks in leaving it often to the care of\nhis highly drilled staff. Still, he did usually come home to his tea\nabout six o'clock of an evening, like the rest, and like the rest, he\nbrought with him a copy of the _Signal_ to glance at during tea.\n\nOne afternoon in July he arrived thus upon his waiting wife at Machin\nHouse, Bleakridge. And she could see that an idea was fermenting in his\nhead. Nellie understood him. One of the most delightful and reassuring\nthings about his married life was Nellie's instinctive comprehension of\nhim. His mother understood him profoundly. But she understood him in a\nmanner sardonic, slightly malicious and even hostile, whereas Nellie\nunderstood him with her absurd love. According to his mother's attitude,\nDenry was guilty till he had proved himself innocent. According to\nNellie's, he was always right and always clever in what he did, until he\nhimself said that he had been wrong and stupid--and not always then.\nNevertheless, his mother was just as ridiculously proud of him as Nellie\nwas; but she would have perished on the scaffold rather than admit that\nDenry differed in any detail from the common run of sons. Mrs Machin had\ndeparted from Machin House without waiting to be asked. It was\ncharacteristic of her that she had returned to Brougham Street and\nrented there an out-of-date cottage without a single one of the\nlabour-saving contrivances that distinguished the residence which her\nson had originally built for her.\n\nIt was still delicious for Denry to sit down to tea in the dining-room,\nthat miracle of conveniences, opposite the smile of his wife, which told\nhim (_a_) that he was wonderful, (_b_) that she was enchanted to be\nalive, and (_c_) that he had deserved her particular caressing\nattentions and would receive them. On the afternoon in July the smile\ntold him (_d_) that he was possessed by one of his ideas.\n\n\"Extraordinary how she tumbles to things!\" he reflected.\n\nNellie's new fox-terrier had come in from the garden through the French\nwindow, and eaten part of a muffin, and Denry had eaten a muffin and a\nhalf, before Nellie, straightening herself proudly and putting her\nshoulders back (a gesture of hers) thought fit to murmur:\n\n\"Well, anything thrilling happened to-day?\"\n\nDenry opened the green sheet and read:\n\n\"'Sudden death of Alderman Bloor in London.' What price that?\"\n\n\"Oh!\" exclaimed Nellie. \"How shocked father will be! They were always\nrather friendly. By the way, I had a letter from mother this morning. It\nappears as if Toronto was a sort of paradise. But you can see the old\nthing prefers Bursley. Father's had a boil on his neck, just at the edge\nof his collar. He says it's because he's too well. What did Mr Bloor die\noff?\"\n\n\"He was in the fashion,\" said Denry.\n\n\"How?\"\n\n\"Appendicitis, of course. Operation--domino! All over in three days.\"\n\n\"Poor man!\" Nellie murmured, trying to feel sad for a change and not\nsucceeding. \"And he was to have been mayor in November, wasn't he? How\ndisappointing for him.\"\n\n\"I expect he's got something else to think about,\" said Denry.\n\nAfter a pause Nellie asked suddenly:\n\n\"Who'll be mayor--now?\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Denry, \"his Worship Councillor Barlow, J.P., will be\nextremely cross if _he_ isn't.\"\n\n\"How horrid!\" said Nellie, frankly. \"And he's got nobody at all to be\nmayoress.\"\n\n\"Mrs Prettyman would be mayoress,\" said Denry. \"When there's no wife or\ndaughter, it's always a sister if there is one.\"\n\n\"But can you _imagine_ Mrs Prettyman as mayoress? Why, they say she\nscrubs her own doorstep--after dark. They ought to make you mayor.\"\n\n\"Do you fancy yourself as mayoress?\" he inquired.\n\n\"I should be better than Mrs Prettyman, anyhow.\"\n\n\"I believe you'd make an A1 mayoress,\" said Denry.\n\n\"I should be frightfully nervous,\" she confidentially admitted.\n\n\"I doubt it,\" said he.\n\nThe fact was, that since her return to Bursley from the honeymoon,\nNellie was an altered woman. She had acquired, as it were in a day, to\nan astonishing extent, what in the Five Towns is called \"a nerve.\"\n\n\"I should like to try it,\" said she.\n\n\"One day you'll have to try it, whether you want to or not.\"\n\n\"When will that be?\"\n\n\"Don't know. Might be next year but one. Old Barlow's pretty certain to\nbe chosen for next November. It's looked on as his turn next. I know\nthere's been a good bit of talk about me for the year after Barlow. Of\ncourse, Bloor's death will advance everything by a year. But even if I\ncome next after Barlow it'll be too late.\"\n\n\"Too late? Too late for what?\"\n\n\"I'll tell you,\" said Denry. \"I wanted to be the youngest mayor that\nBursley's ever had. It was only a kind of notion I had a long time ago.\nI'd given it up, because I knew there was no chance unless I came before\nBloor, which of course I couldn't do. Now he's dead. If I could upset\nold Barlow's apple-cart I should just be the youngest mayor by the skin\nof my teeth. Huskinson, the mayor in 1884, was aged thirty-four and six\nmonths. I've looked it all up this afternoon.\"\n\n\"How lovely if you _could_ be the youngest mayor!\"\n\n\"Yes. I'll tell you how I feel. I feel as though I didn't want to be\nmayor at all if I can't be the youngest mayor... you know.\"\n\nShe knew.\n\n\"Oh!\" she cried, \"do upset Mr Barlow's apple-cart. He's a horrid old\nthing. Should I be the youngest mayoress?\"\n\n\"Not by chalks,\" said he. \"Huskinson's sister was only sixteen.\"\n\n\"But that's only playing at being mayoress!\" Nellie protested. \"Anyhow,\nI do think you might be youngest mayor. Who settles it?\"\n\n\"The Council, of course.\"\n\n\"Nobody likes Councillor Barlow.\"\n\n\"He'll be still less liked when he's wound up the Bursley Football\nClub.\"\n\n\"Well, urge him on to wind it up, then. But I don't see what football\nhas got to do with being mayor.\"\n\nShe endeavoured to look like a serious politician.\n\n\"You are nothing but a cuckoo,\" Denry pleasantly informed her. \"Football\nhas got to do with everything. And it's been a disastrous mistake in my\ncareer that I've never taken any interest in football. Old Barlow wants\nno urging on to wind up the Football Club. He's absolutely set on it.\nHe's lost too much over it. If I could stop him from winding it up, I\nmight....\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"I dunno.\"\n\nShe perceived that his idea was yet vague.\n\n\nII\n\nNot very many days afterwards the walls of Bursley called attention, by\nsmall blue and red posters (blue and red being the historic colours of\nthe Bursley Football Club), to a public meeting, which was to be held in\nthe Town Hall, under the presidency of the Mayor, to consider what steps\ncould be taken to secure the future of the Bursley Football Club.\n\nThere were two \"great\" football clubs in the Five Towns--Knype, one of\nthe oldest clubs in England, and Bursley. Both were in the League,\nthough Knype was in the first division while Bursley was only in the\nsecond. Both were, in fact, limited companies, engaged as much in the\npursuit of dividends as in the practice of the one ancient and glorious\nsport which appeals to the reason and the heart of England. (Neither\never paid a dividend.) Both employed professionals, who, by a strange\nchance, were nearly all born in Scotland; and both also employed\ntrainers who, before an important match, took the teams off to a\nhydropathic establishment far, far distant from any public-house. (This\nwas called \"training.\") Now, whereas the Knype Club was struggling along\nfairly well, the Bursley Club had come to the end of its resources. The\ngreat football public had practically deserted it. The explanation, of\ncourse, was that Bursley had been losing too many matches. The great\nfootball public had no use for anything but victories. It would treat\nits players like gods--so long as they won. But when they happened to\nlose, the great football public simply sulked. It did not kick a man\nthat was down; it merely ignored him, well knowing that the man could\nnot get up without help. It cared nothing whatever for fidelity,\nmunicipal patriotism, fair play, the chances of war, or dividends on\ncapital. If it could see victories it would pay sixpence, but it would\nnot pay sixpence to assist at defeats.\n\nStill, when at a special general meeting of the Bursley Football Club,\nLimited, held at the registered office, the Coffee House, Bursley,\nCouncillor Barlow, J.P., Chairman of the Company since the creation of\nthe League, announced that the Directors had reluctantly come to the\nconclusion that they could not conscientiously embark on the dangerous\nrisks of the approaching season, and that it was the intention of the\nDirectors to wind up the club, in default of adequate public interest--\nwhen Bursley read this in the _Signal_, the town was certainly\nshocked. Was the famous club, then, to disappear for ever, and the\nfootball ground to be sold in plots, and the grand stand for firewood?\nThe shock was so severe that the death of Alderman Bloor (none the less\na mighty figure in Bursley) had passed as a minor event.\n\nHence the advertisement of the meeting in the Town Hall caused joy and\nhope, and people said to themselves: \"Something's bound to be done; the\nold club can't go out like that.\" And everybody grew quite sentimental.\nAnd although nothing is supposed to be capable of filling Bursley Town\nHall except a political meeting and an old folk's treat, Bursley Town\nHall was as near full as made no matter for the football question. Many\nmen had cheerfully sacrificed a game of billiards and a glass of beer in\norder to attend it.\n\nThe Mayor, in the chair, was a mild old gentleman who knew nothing\nwhatever about football and had probably never seen a football match;\nbut it was essential that the meeting should have august patronage and\nso the Mayor had been trapped and tamed. On the mere fact that he paid\nan annual subscription to the golf club, certain parties built up the\nlegend that he was a true sportsman, with the true interests of sport in\nhis soul.\n\nHe uttered a few phrases, such as \"the manly game,\" \"old associations,\"\n\"bound up with the history of England,\" \"splendid fellows,\"\n\"indomitable pluck,\" \"dogged by misfortune\" (indeed, he produced quite\nan impression on the rude and grim audience), and then he called upon\nCouncillor Barlow to make a statement.\n\nCouncillor Barlow, on the Mayor's right, was a different kind of man\nfrom the Mayor. He was fifty and iron-grey, with whiskers, but no\nmoustache; short, stoutish, raspish.\n\nHe said nothing about manliness, pluck, history, or Auld Lang Syne.\n\nHe said he had given his services as Chairman to the football club for\nthirteen years; that he had taken up \u00c2\u00a32000 worth of shares in the\nCompany; and that as at that moment the Company's liabilities would\nexactly absorb its assets, his \u00c2\u00a32000 was worth exactly nothing. \"You may\nsay,\" he said, \"I've lost that \u00c2\u00a32000 in thirteen years. That is, it's\nthe same as if I'd been steadily paying three pun' a week out of my own\npocket to provide football matches that you chaps wouldn't take the\ntrouble to go and see. That's the straight of it! What have I got for my\npains? Nothing but worries and these!\" (He pointed to his grey hairs.)\n\"And I'm not alone; there's others; and now I have to come and defend\nmyself at a public meeting. I'm supposed not to have the best interests\nof football at heart. Me and my co-Directors,\" he proceeded, with even a\nrougher raspishness, \"have warned the town again and again what would\nhappen if the matches weren't better patronised. And now it's happened,\nand now it's too late, you want to _do_ something! You can't! It's\ntoo late. There's only one thing the matter with first-class football in\nBursley,\" he concluded, \"and it isn't the players. It's the public--it's\nyourselves. You're the most craven lot of tom-fools that ever a big\nfootball club had to do with. When we lose a match, what do you do? Do\nyou come and encourage us next time? No, you stop away, and leave us\nfifty or sixty pound out of pocket on a match, just to teach us better!\nDo you expect us to win every match? Why, Preston North End itself\"--\nhere he spoke solemnly, of heroes--\"Preston North End itself in its\ngreat days didn't win every match--it lost to Accrington. But did the\nPreston public desert it? No! _You_--you haven't got the pluck of a\nlouse, nor the faithfulness of a cat. You've starved your football club\nto death, and now you call a meeting to weep and grumble. And you have\nthe insolence to write letters to the _Signal_ about bad\nmanagement, forsooth! If anybody in the hall thinks he can manage this\nclub better than me and my co-Directors have done, I may say that we\nhold a majority of the shares, and we'll part with the whole show to any\nclever person or persons who care to take it off our hands at a bargain\nprice. That's talking.\"\n\nHe sat down.\n\nSilence fell. Even in the Five Towns a public meeting is seldom bullied\nas Councillor Barlow had bullied that meeting. It was aghast. Councillor\nBarlow had never been popular: he had merely been respected; but\nthenceforward he became even less popular than before.\n\n\"I'm sure we shall all find Councillor Barlow's heat quite excusable--\"\nthe Mayor diplomatically began.\n\n\"No heat at all,\" the Councillor interrupted. \"Simply cold truth!\"\n\nA number of speakers followed, and nearly all of them were against the\nDirectors. Some, with prodigious memories for every combination of\nplayers in every match that had ever been played, sought to prove by\ndetailed instances that Councillor Barlow and his co-Directors had\npersistently and regularly muddled their work during thirteen\nindustrious years. And they defended the insulted public by asserting\nthat no public that respected itself would pay sixpence to watch the\nwretched football provided by Councillor Barlow. They shouted that the\nteam wanted reconstituting, wanted new blood.\n\n\"Yes,\" shouted Councillor Barlow in reply; \"And how are you going to get\nnew blood, with transfer fees as high as they are now? You can't get\neven an average good player for less than \u00c2\u00a3200. Where's the money to\ncome from? Anybody want to lend a thousand or so on second debentures?\"\n\nHe laughed sneeringly.\n\nNo one showed a desire to invest in second debentures of the Bursley\nF.C. Ltd.\n\nStill, speakers kept harping on the necessity of new blood in the team,\nand then others, bolder, harped on the necessity of new blood on the\nboard.\n\n\"Shares on sale!\" cried the Councillor. \"Any buyers? Or,\" he added, \"do\nyou want something for nothing--as usual?\"\n\nAt length a gentleman rose at the back of the hall.\n\n\"I don't pretend to be an expert on football,\" said he, \"though I think\nit's a great game, but I should like to say a few words as to this\nquestion of new blood.\"\n\nThe audience craned its neck.\n\n\"Will Mr Councillor Machin kindly step up to the platform?\" the Mayor\nsuggested.\n\nAnd up Denry stepped.\n\nThe thought in every mind was: \"What's he going to do? What's he got up\nhis sleeve--this time?\"\n\n\"Three cheers for Machin!\" people chanted gaily.\n\n\"Order!\" said the Mayor.\n\nDenry faced the audience. He was now accustomed to audiences. He said:\n\n\"If I'm not mistaken, one of the greatest modern footballers is a native\nof this town.\"\n\nAnd scores of voices yelled: \"Ay! Callear! Callear! Greatest centre\nforward in England!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Denry. \"Callear is the man I mean. Callear left the\ndistrict, unfortunately for the district, at the age of nineteen for\nLiverpool. And it was not till after he left that his astounding\nabilities were perceived. It isn't too much to say that he made the\nfortune of Liverpool City. And I believe it is the fact that he scored\nmore goals in three seasons than any other player has ever done in the\nLeague. Then, York County, which was in a tight place last year, bought\nhim from Liverpool for a high price, and, as all the world knows,\nCallear had his leg broken in the first match he played for his new\nclub. That just happened to be the ruin of the York Club, which is now\nquite suddenly in bankruptcy (which happily we are not), and which is\ndisposing of its players. Gentlemen, I say that Callear ought to come\nback to his native town. He is fitter than ever he was, and his proper\nplace is in his native town.\"\n\nLoud cheers.\n\n\"As captain and centre forward of the club of the Mother of the Five\nTowns, he would be an immense acquisition and attraction, and he would\nlead us to victory.\"\n\nRenewed cheers.\n\n\"And how,\" demanded Councillor Barlow, jumping up angrily, \"are we to\nget him back to his precious native town? Councillor Machin admits that\nhe is not an expert on football. It will probably be news to him that\nAston Villa have offered \u00c2\u00a3700 to York for the transfer of Callear, and\nBlackburn Rovers have offered \u00c2\u00a3750, and they're fighting it out between\n'em. Any gentleman willing to put down \u00c2\u00a3800 to buy Callear for Bursley?\"\nhe sneered. \"I don't mind telling you that steam-engines and the King\nhimself couldn't get Callear into our club.\"\n\n\"Quite finished?\" Denry inquired, still standing.\n\nLaughter, overtopped by Councillor Barlow's snort as he sat down.\n\nDenry lifted his voice.\n\n\"Mr Callear, will you be good enough to step forward and let us all have\na look at you?\"\n\nThe effect of these apparently simple words surpassed any effect\npreviously obtained by the most complex flights of oratory in that hall.\nA young, blushing, clumsy, long-limbed, small-bodied giant stumbled\nalong the central aisle and climbed the steps to the platform, where\nDenry pointed him to a seat. He was recognised by all the true votaries\nof the game. And everybody said to everybody: \"By Gosh! It's him, right\nenough. It's Callear!\" And a vast astonishment and expectation of good\nfortune filled the hall. Applause burst forth, and though no one knew\nwhat the appearance of Callear signified, the applause continued and\nwaxed.\n\n\"Good old Callear!\" The hoarse shouts succeeded each other. \"Good old\nMachin!\"\n\n\"Anyhow,\" said Denry, when the storm was stilled, \"we've got him here,\nwithout either steam-engines or His Majesty. Will the Directors of the\nclub accept him?\"\n\n\"And what about the transfer?\" Councillor Barlow demanded.\n\n\"Would you accept him and try another season if you could get him free?\"\nDenry retorted.\n\nCouncillor Barlow always knew his mind, and was never afraid to let\nother people share that knowledge.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said.\n\n\"Then I will see that you have the transfer free.\"\n\n\"But what about York?\"\n\n\"I have settled with York provisionally,\" said Denry. \"That is my\naffair. I have returned from York to-day. Leave all that to me. This\ntown has had many benefactors far more important than myself. But I\nshall be able to claim this originality: I'm the first to make a present\nof a live man to the town. Gentlemen--Mr Mayor--I venture to call for\nthree cheers for the greatest centre forward in England, our\nfellow-townsman.\"\n\nThe scene, as the _Signal_ said, was unique.\n\nAnd at the Sports Club and the other clubs afterwards, men said to each\nother: \"No one but him would have thought of bringing Callear over\nspecially and showing him on the platform.... That's cost him above\ntwopence, that has!\"\n\nTwo days later a letter appeared in the _Signal_ (signed \"Fiat\nJustitia\"), suggesting that Denry, as some reward for his public spirit,\nought to be the next mayor of Bursley, in place of Alderman Bloor\ndeceased. The letter urged that he would make an admirable mayor, the\nsort of mayor the old town wanted in order to wake it up. And also it\npointed out that Denry would be the youngest mayor that Bursley had ever\nhad, and probably the youngest mayor in England that year. The sentiment\nin the last idea appealed to the town. The town decided that it would\npositively _like_ to have the youngest mayor it had ever had, and\nprobably the youngest mayor in England that year. The _Signal_\nprinted dozens of letters on the subject. When the Council met, more\ninformally than formally, to choose a chief magistrate in place of the\ndead alderman, several councillors urged that what Bursley wanted was a\nyoung and _popular_ mayor. And, in fine, Councillor Barlow was\nshelved for a year. On the choice being published the entire town said:\n\"Now we _shall_ have a mayoralty--and don't you forget it!\"\n\nAnd Denry said to Nellie: \"You'll be mayoress to the youngest mayor,\netc., my child. And it's cost me, including hotel and travelling\nexpenses, eight hundred and eleven pounds six and seven-pence.\"\n\n\nIII\n\nThe rightness of the Council in selecting Denry as mayor was confirmed\nin a singular manner by the behaviour of the football and of Callear at\nthe opening match of the season.\n\nIt was a philanthropic match, between Bursley and Axe, for the benefit\nof a county orphanage, and, according to the custom of such matches, the\nball was formally kicked off by a celebrity, a pillar of society. The\nceremony of kicking off has no sporting significance; the celebrity\nmerely with gentleness propels the ball out of the white circle and then\nflies for his life from the _m\u00c3\u00aal\u00c3\u00a9e_; but it is supposed to add to\nthe moral splendour of the game. In the present instance the posters\nsaid: \"Kick-off at 3.45 by Councillor E.H. Machin, Mayor-designate.\"\nAnd, indeed, no other celebrity could have been decently selected. On\nthe fine afternoon of the match Denry therefore discovered himself with\na new football at his toes, a silk hat on his head, and twenty-two\nHerculean players menacing him in attitudes expressive of an intention\nto murder him. Bursley had lost the toss, and hence Denry had to kick\ntowards the Bursley goal. As the _Signal_ said, he \"despatched the\nsphere\" straight into the keeping of Callear, who as centre forward was\nfacing him, and Callear was dodging down the field with it before the\nAxe players had finished admiring Denry's effrontery. Every reader will\nremember with a thrill the historic match in which the immortal Jimmy\nBrown, on the last occasion when he captained Blackburn Rovers, dribbled\nthe ball himself down the length of the field, scored a goal, and went\nhome with the English Cup under his arm. Callear evidently intended to\nimitate the feat. He was entirely wrong. Dribbling tactics had been\nkilled for ever, years before, by Preston North End, who invented the\n\"passing\" game. Yet Callear went on, and good luck seemed to float over\nhim like a cherub. Finally he shot; a wild, high shot; but there was an\nadverse wind which dragged the ball down, swept it round, and blew it\ninto the net. The first goal had been scored in twenty seconds! (It was\nalso the last in the match.) Callear's reputation was established.\nUseless for solemn experts to point out that he had simply been larking\nfor the gallery, and that the result was a shocking fluke--Callear's\nreputation was established. He became at once the idol of the populace.\nAs Denry walked gingerly off the field to the grand stand he, too, was\nloudly cheered, and he could not help feeling that, somehow, it was he\nwho had scored that goal. And although nobody uttered the precise\nthought, most people did secretly think, as they gazed at the triumphant\nDenry, that a man who triumphed like that, because he triumphed like\nthat, was the right sort of man to be mayor, the kind of man they\nneeded.\n\nDenry became identified with the highest class of local football. This\nfact led to a curious crisis in the history of municipal manners. On\nCorporation Sunday the mayor walks to church, preceded by the mace, and\nfollowed by the aldermen and councillors, the borough officials, the\nVolunteers and the Fire Brigade; after all these, in the procession,\ncome individuals known as prominent citizens. Now the first and second\nelevens of the Bursley Football Club, headed by Callear, expressed their\ndesire to occupy a place in Denry's mayoral procession; they felt that\nsome public acknowledgment was due to the Mayor for his services to the\nnational sport. Denry instantly agreed, with thanks: the notion seemed\nto him entirely admirable. Then some unfortunately-inspired parson wrote\nto the _Signal_ to protest against professional footballers\nfollowing the chief magistrate of the borough to church. His arguments\nwere that such a thing was unheard-of, and that football was the cause\nof a great deal of evil gambling. Some people were inclined to agree\nwith the protest, until Denry wrote to the _Signal_ and put a few\nquestions: Was Bursley proud of its football team? Or was Bursley\nashamed of its football team? Was the practice of football incompatible\nwith good citizenship? Was there anything dishonourable in playing\nfootball? Ought professional footballers to be considered as social\npariahs? Was there any class of beings to whom the churches ought to be\nclosed?\n\nThe parson foundered in a storm of opprobrium, scorn, and ironic\nlaughter. Though the town laughed, it only laughed to hide its disgust\nof the parson.\n\nPeople began to wonder whether the teams would attend in costume,\ncarrying the football between them on a charger as a symbol. No such\nmultitudes ever greeted a mayoral procession in Bursley before. The\nfootballers, however, appeared in ordinary costume (many of them in\nfrock-coats); but they wore neckties of the club colours, a device which\nwas agreed to be in the nicest taste. St Luke's Church was crowded; and,\nwhat is stranger, the churchyard was also crowded. The church barely\nheld the procession itself and the ladies who, by influence, had been\naccommodated with seats in advance. Thousands of persons filled the\nchurchyard, and to prevent them from crushing into the packed fane and\nbursting it at its weakest point, the apse, the doors had to be locked\nand guarded. Four women swooned during the service: neither Mrs Machin,\nsenior, nor Nellie, was among the four. It was the first time that any\none had been known to swoon at a religious service held in November.\nThis fact alone gave a tremendous prestige to Denry's mayoralty. When,\nwith Nellie on his arm, he emerged from the church to the thunders of\nthe organ, the greeting which he received in the churchyard, though the\nsolemnity of the occasion forbade clapping, lacked naught in brilliance\nand efficacy.\n\nThe real point and delight of that Corporation Sunday was not fully\nappreciated till later. It had been expected that the collection after\nthe sermon would be much larger than usual, because the congregation was\nmuch larger than usual. But the church-wardens were startled to find it\nfour times as large as usual. They were further startled to find only\nthree threepenny-bits among all the coins. This singularity led to\ncomment and to note-comparing. Everybody had noticed for weeks past a\ngrowing dearth of threepenny-bits. Indeed, threepenny-bits had\npractically vanished from circulation in the Five Towns. On the Monday\nit became known that the clerks of the various branches of the Universal\nThrift Club, Limited, had paid into the banks enormous and unparalleled\nquantities of threepenny-bits, and for at least a week afterwards\neverybody paid for everything in threepenny-bits. And the piquant news\npassed from mouth to mouth that Denry, to the simple end of ensuring a\nthumping collection for charities on Corporation Sunday, had used the\nvast organisation of the Thrift Club to bring about a famine of\nthreepenny-bits. In the annals of the town that Sunday is referred to as\n\"Threepenny-bit Sunday,\" because it was so happily devoid of\nthreepenny-bits.\n\nA little group of councillors were discussing Denry.\n\n\"What a card!\" said one, laughing joyously. \"He's a rare 'un, no\nmistake.\"\n\n\"Of course, this'll make him more popular than ever,\" said another.\n\"We've never had a man to touch him for that.\"\n\n\"And yet,\" demanded Councillor Barlow, \"what's he done? Has he ever done\na day's work in his life? What great cause is he identified with?\"\n\n\"He's identified,\" said the speaker, \"with the great cause of cheering\nus all up.\"\n\n   *       *       *       *       *\n\n_Printed by Jarrold & Sons Ltd.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp:\/\/pglaf.org\/fundraising.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":882,"split":"train"}
