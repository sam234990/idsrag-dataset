Mauprat resembles the fairy tale \"Beauty and the Beast\". As this would suggest, the novel is a romance. However, Sand resists the immediate happy ending of marriage between the two main characters in favor of a more gradual story of education, including a reappraisal of the passive female role in courtship and marriage. Sand also calls into question Rousseau's ideal version of the female education as described in his novel Emile, namely, training women for domesticity and the home.\nThe novel, set before the French Revolution, depicts the coming of age of a nobleman named Bernard Mauprat. The story is narrated by the old Bernard in his country home many years later, as told to a nameless young male visitor. Bernard recounts how, raised by a violent gang of his feudal kinsmen after the death of his mother, he becomes a brutalized \"enfant sauvage\". When his cousin Edm\u0102\u0160e is held captive by Bernard's \"family\", he helps her escape, but elicits a promise of marriage from her by threatening rape. Thus begins the long courtship of Bernard and Edm\u0102\u0160e. The novel ends with a dramatic trial scene, similar to that in Stendhal's The Red and the Black.\nDuring the period Sand wrote the novel, she was gradually becoming more interested in the problem of political equality in society. She had read widely about the views of socialist thinkers such as Pierre Leroux, with whom she went on to form a journal, the Revue Ind\u0102\u0160pendante. In keeping with Sand's interest in equality, Mauprat depicts a new type of literary figure, the peasant visionary Patience. In addition, part of the novel takes place during the American Revolutionary War.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of Mauprat, by George Sand\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

He had, no doubt, several types\nof women in mind, but it is more than probable that the banishment of\nMadame de Stael rose before him as one of the mistakes in his career. It\nwas not that he showed lack of judgment merely by the persecution of a\nrare talent, but by failing to see that the rare talent was pointing out\ntruths very valuable to his own safety. This is what happened in France\nwhen George Sand--the greatest woman writer the world has known, or is\never likely to know--was attacked by the orthodox critics of her time.\nThey feared her warnings; they detested her sincerity--a sincerity\ndisplayed as much in her life as in her works (the hypocrite's Paradise\nwas precisely her idea of Hell); they resented bitterly an independence\nof spirit which in a man would have been in the highest degree\ndistinguished, which remained, under every test, untamable. With a kind\nof _bonhomie_ which one can only compare with Fielding's, with a passion\nas great as Montaigne's for acknowledging the truths of experience,\nwith an absence of self-consciousness truly amazing in the artistic\ntemperament of either sex, she wrote exactly as she thought, saw and\nfelt. Humour was not her strong point. She had an exultant joy in\nliving, but laughter, whether genial or sardonic, is not in her work.\nIrony she seldom, if ever, employed; satire she never attempted. It was\non the maternal, the sympathetic side that her femininity, and therefore\nher creative genius, was most strongly developed. She was masculine only\nin the deliberate libertinism of certain episodes in her own life. This\nwas a characteristic--one on no account to be overlooked or denied or\ndisguised, but it was not her character. The character was womanly,\ntender, exquisitely patient and good-natured. She would take cross\nhumanity in her arms, and carry it out into the sunshine of the fields;\nshe would show it flowers and birds, sing songs to it, tell it stories,\nrecall its original beauty. Even in her moods of depression and revolt,\none recognises the fatigue of the strong. It is never for a moment the\nlassitude of the feeble, the weary spite of a sick and ill-used soul. As\nshe was free from personal vanity, she was also free from hysteria. On\nmarriage--the one subject which drove her to a certain though always\ndisciplined violence--she clearly felt more for others than they\nfelt for themselves; and in observing certain households and life\npartnerships, she may have been afflicted with a dismay which the\nunreflecting sufferers did not share. No writer who was carried away\nby egoistic anger or disappointment could have told these stories of\nunhappiness, infidelity, and luckless love with such dispassionate\nlucidity.\n\nWith the artist's dislike of all that is positive and arbitrary, she\nwas, nevertheless, subject rather to her intellect than her emotions.\nAn insult to her intelligence was the one thing she found it hard\nto pardon, and she allowed no external interference to disturb her\nrelations with her own reasoning faculty. She followed caprices, no\ndoubt, but she was never under any apprehension with regard to their\ntrue nature, displaying in this respect a detachment which is usually\nconsidered exclusively virile. _Elle et Lui_, which, perhaps because\nit is short and associated with actual facts, is the most frequently\ndiscussed in general conversation on her work, remains probably the\nsanest account of a sentimental experiment which was ever written. How\nfar it may have seemed accurate to De Musset is not to the point.\nHer version of her grievance is at least convincing. Without fear and\nwithout hope, she makes her statement, and it stands, therefore, unique\nof its kind among indictments. It has been said that her fault was an\nexcess of emotionalism; that is to say, she attached too much importance\nto mere feeling and described it, in French of marvellous ease and\nbeauty, with a good deal of something else which one can almost condemn\nas the high-flown. Not that the high-flown is of necessity unnatural,\nbut it is misleading; it places the passing mood, the lyrical note,\ndependent on so many accidents, above the essential temperament and the\ndominant chord which depend on life only. Where she falls short of the\nvery greatest masters is in this all but deliberate confusion of things\nwhich must change or can be changed with things which are unchangeable,\nincurable, and permanent. Shakespeare, it is true, makes all his\nvillains talk poetry, but it is the poetry which a villain, were he a\npoet, would inevitably write. George Sand glorifies every mind with her\nown peculiar fire and tears. The fire is, fortunately, so much stronger\nthan the tears that her passion never degenerates into the maudlin. All\nthe same, she makes too universal a use of her own strongest gifts,\nand this is why she cannot be said to excel as a portrait painter. One\nmerit, however, is certain: if her earliest writings were dangerous,\nit was because of her wonderful power of idealization, not because she\nfilled her pages with the revolting and epicene sensuality of the new\nItalian, French, and English schools. Intellectual viciousness was\nnot her failing, and she never made the modern mistake of confusing\nindecency with vigour. She loved nature, air, and light too well and\ntoo truly to go very far wrong in her imaginations. It may indeed be\nimpossible for many of us to accept all her social and political views;\nthey have no bearing, fortunately, on the quality of her literary art;\nthey have to be considered under a different aspect. In politics, her\njudgment, as displayed in the letters to Mazzini, was profound. Her\ncorrespondence with Flaubert shows us a capacity for stanch, unblemished\nfriendship unequalled, probably, in the biographies, whether published\nor unpublished, of the remarkable.\n\nWith regard to her impiety--for such it should be called--it did not\narise from arrogance, nor was it based in any way upon the higher\nlearning of her period. Simply she did not possess the religious\ninstinct. She understood it sympathetically--in _Spiridion_, for\ninstance, she describes an ascetic nature as it has never been done in\nany other work of fiction. Newman himself has not written passages of\ndeeper or purer mysticism, of more sincere spirituality. Balzac, in\n_Seraphita_, attempted something of the kind, but the result was never\nmore than a _tour de force_. He could invent, he could describe, but\nGeorge Sand felt; and as she felt, she composed, living with and\nloving with an understanding love all her creations. But it has to be\nremembered always that she repudiated all religious restraint, that she\nbelieved in the human heart, that she acknowledged no higher law than\nits own impulses, that she saw love where others see only a cruel\nstruggle for existence, that she found beauty where ordinary visions can\ndetect little besides a selfishness worse than brutal and a squalor more\npitiful than death. Everywhere she insists upon the purifying influence\nof affection, no matter how degraded in its circumstances or how illegal\nin its manifestation. No writer--not excepting the Brontes--has shown\na deeper sympathy with uncommon temperaments, misunderstood aims,\nconsciences with flickering lights, the discontented, the abnormal, or\nthe unhappy. The great modern specialist for nervous diseases has not\nimproved on her analysis of the neuropathic and hysterical. There is\nscarcely a novel of hers in which some character does not appear who\nis, in the usual phrase, out of the common run. Yet, with this perfect\nunderstanding of the exceptional case, she never permits any science of\ncause and effect to obscure the rules and principles which in the main\ncontrol life for the majority. It was, no doubt, this balance which made\nher a popular writer, even while she never ceased to keep in touch with\nthe most acute minds of France.\n\nShe possessed, in addition to creative genius of an order especially\nindividual and charming, a capacity for the invention of ideas. There\nare in many of her chapters more ideas, more suggestions than one\nwould find in a whole volume of Flaubert. It is not possible that these\nsurprising, admirable, and usually sound thoughts were the result of\nlong hours of reflection. They belonged to her nature and a quality of\njudgment which, even in her most extravagant romances, is never for a\nmoment swayed from that sane impartiality described by the unobservant\nas common sense.\n\nHer fairness to women was not the least astounding of her gifts. She is\nkind to the beautiful, the yielding, above all to the very young, and in\nnone of her stories has she introduced any violently disagreeable female\ncharacters. Her villains are mostly men, and even these she invests\nwith a picturesque fatality which drives them to errors, crimes,\nand scoundrelism with a certain plaintive, if relentless, grace. The\ninconstant lover is invariably pursued by the furies of remorse; the\nbrutal has always some mitigating influence in his career; the libertine\nretains through many vicissitudes a seraphic love for some faithful\nSolveig.\n\nHumanity meant far more to her than art: she began her literary career\nby describing facts as she knew them: critics drove her to examine their\ncauses, and so she gradually changed from the chronicler with strong\nsympathies to the interpreter with a reasoned philosophy. She discovered\nthat a great deal of the suffering in this world is due not so much to\noriginal sin, but to a kind of original stupidity, an unimaginative,\nstubborn stupidity. People were dishonest because they believed,\nwrongly, that dishonesty was somehow successful. They were cruel because\nthey supposed that repulsive exhibitions of power inspired a prolonged\nfear. They were treacherous because they had never been taught the\ngreater strength of candour. George Sand tried to point out the\nadvantage of plain dealing, and the natural goodness of mankind\nwhen uncorrupted by a false education. She loved the wayward and\nthe desolate: pretentiousness in any disguise was the one thing she\nsuspected and could not tolerate. It may be questioned whether she ever\ndeceived herself; but it must be said, that on the whole she flattered\nweakness--and excused, by enchanting eloquence, much which cannot always\nbe justified merely on the ground that it is explicable. But to explain\nwas something--all but everything at the time of her appearance in\nliterature. Every novel she wrote made for charity--for a better\nacquaintance with our neighbour's woes and our own egoism. Such an\nattitude of mind is only possible to an absolutely frank, even Arcadian,\nnature. She did what she wished to do: she said what she had to say, not\nbecause she wanted to provoke excitement or astonish the multitude, but\nbecause she had succeeded eminently in leading her own life according to\nher own lights. The terror of appearing inconsistent excited her scorn.\nAppearances never troubled that unashamed soul. This is the magic, the\npeculiar fascination of her books. We find ourselves in the presence\nof a freshness, a primeval vigour which produces actually the effect of\nseeing new scenes, of facing a fresh climate. Her love of the soil,\nof flowers, and the sky, for whatever was young and unspoilt, seems\nto animate every page--even in her passages of rhetorical sentiment we\nnever suspect the burning pastille, the gauze tea-gown, or the depressed\npink light. Rhetoric it may be, but it is the rhetoric of the sea and\nthe wheat field. It can be spoken in the open air and read by the light\nof day.\n\nGeorge Sand never confined herself to any especial manner in her\nliterary work. Her spontaneity of feeling and the actual fecundity, as\nit were, of her imaginative gift, could not be restrained, concentrated,\nand formally arranged as it was in the case of the two first masters of\nmodern French novel-writing. Her work in this respect may be compared to\na gold mine, while theirs is rather the goldsmith's craft. It must not\nbe supposed, however, that she was a writer without very strong views\nwith regard to the construction of a plot and the development of\ncharacter. Her literary essays and reviews show a knowledge of technique\nwhich could be accepted at any time as a text-book for the critics and\nthe criticised. She knew exactly how artistic effects were obtained, how\nand why certain things were done, why realism, so-called, could never be\nanything but caricature, and why over-elaboration of small matters can\nnever be otherwise than disproportionate. Nothing could be more just\nthan her saying about Balzac that he was such a logician that he\ninvented things more truthful than the truth itself. No one knew better\nthan she that the truth, as it is commonly understood, does not exist;\nthat it cannot be logical because of its mystery; and that it is\nthe knowledge of its contradictions which shows the real expert in\npsychology.\n\nThree of her stories--_La Petite Fadette_, _La Mare au Diable_, and\n_Les Maitres Mosaistes_--are as neat in their workmanship as a Dutch\npainting. Her brilliant powers of analysis, the intellectual atmosphere\nwith which she surrounds the more complex characters in her longer\nromances, are entirely put aside, and we are given instead a series\nof pictures and dialogues in what has been called the purely objective\nstyle; so pure in its objectivity and detachment that it would be hard\nfor any one to decide from internal evidence that they were in reality\nher own composition.\n\nTo those who seek for proportion and form there is, without doubt, much\nthat is unsymmetrical in her designs. Interesting she always is, but to\nthe trained eye scenes of minor importance are, strictly speaking, too\nlong: descriptions in musical language sometimes distract the reader\nfrom the progress of the story. But this arose from her own joy in\nwriting: much as she valued proportion, she liked expressing her mind\nbetter, not out of conceit or self-importance, but as the birds, whom\nshe loved so well, sing.\n\nGood nature is what we need above all in reading George Sand. It is\nthere--infectious enough in her own pages, and with it the courage which\ncan come only from a heart at peace with itself. This is why neither\nfashion nor new nor old criticism can affect the title of George Sand\namong the greatest influences of the last century and the present one.\nMuch that she has said still seems untried and unexpected. Writers so\nopposite as Ibsen and Anatole France have expanded her themes. She is\nquoted unconsciously to-day by hundreds who are ignorant of their real\nsource of inspiration. No woman ever wrote with such force before, and\nno woman since has even approached her supreme accomplishments.\n\nPEARL MARY-TERESA CRAIGIE.\n\n\n\n\nLIFE OF GEORGE SAND\n\nGeorge Sand, in whose life nothing was commonplace, was born in Paris,\n\"in the midst of roses, to the sound of music,\" at a dance which her\nmother had somewhat rashly attended, on the 5th of July, 1804. Her\nmaiden name was Armentine Lucile Aurore Dupin, and her ancestry was of\na romantic character. She was, in fact, of royal blood, being the\ngreat-grand-daughter of the Marshal Maurice du Saxe and a Mlle.\nVerriere; her grandfather was M. Dupin de Francueil, the charming friend\nof Rousseau and Mme. d'Epinay; her father, Maurice Dupin, was a gay and\nbrilliant soldier, who married the pretty daughter of a bird-fancier,\nand died early. She was a child of the people on her mother's side, an\naristocrat on her father's. In 1807 she was taken by her father, who was\non Murat's staff, into Spain, from which she returned to the house of\nher grandmother, at Nohant in Berry. This old lady adopted Aurore at the\ndeath of her father, in 1808. Of her childhood George Sand has given a\nmost picturesque account in her \"Histoire de ma Vie.\" In 1817 the girl\nwas sent to the Convent of the English Augustinians in Paris, where she\npassed through a state of religious mysticism. She returned to Nohant\nin 1820, and soon threw off her pietism in the outdoor exercises of a\nwholesome country life. Within a few months, Mme. Dupin de Francueil\ndied at a great age, and Aurore was tempted to return to Paris. Her\nrelatives, however, were anxious that she should not do this, and\nthey introduced to her the natural son of a retired colonel, the Baron\nDudevant, whom, in September, 1822, she married. She brought him to live\nwith her at Nohant, and she bore him two sons, Maurice and Solange,\nand a daughter. She quickly perceived, as her own intellectual nature\ndeveloped, that her boorish husband was unsuited to her, but their early\nyears of married life were not absolutely intolerable. In 1831, however,\nshe could endure him no longer, and an amicable separation was agreed\nupon. She left M. Dudevant at Nohant, resigning her fortune, and\nproceeded to Paris, where she was hard pressed to find a living. She\nendeavoured, without success, to paint the lids of cigar-boxes, and in\nfinal desperation, under the influence of Jules Sandeau--who became her\nlover, and who invented the pseudonym of George Sand for her--she turned\nher attention to literature. Her earliest work was to help Sandeau in\nthe composition of his novel, \"Rose et Blanche\" Her first independent\nnovel, \"Indiana,\" appeared at the close of 1831, and her second,\n\"Valentine,\" two months later. These books produced a great and\nimmediate sensation, and she felt that she had found her vocation.\nIn 1833 she produced \"Lebia\"; in 1834 the \"Lettres d'un Voyageur\" and\n\"Jacques\"; in 1835 \"Andre\" and \"Leone Leoni.\" After this her works\nbecome too numerous and were produced with too monotonous a regularity\nto be chronicled here. But it should be said that \"Mauprat\" was written\nin 1836 at Nohant, while she was pleading for a legal separation from\nher husband, which was given her by the tribunal of Bourges, with full\nauthority over the education of her children. These early novels all\nreflect in measure the personal sorrows of the author, although\nGeorge Sand never ceased to protest against too strict a biographical\ninterpretation of their incidents. \"Spiridion\" (1839), composed under\nthe influence of Lamennais, deals with questions of free thought in\nreligion. But the novels of the first period of her literary activity,\nwhich came to a close in 1840, are mainly occupied with a lyrical\nindividualism, and are inspired by the wrongs and disillusions of the\nauthor's personal adventures.\n\nThe years 1833 and 1834 were marked by her too-celebrated relations with\nAlfred de Musset, with whom she lived in Paris and at Venice, and with\nwhom she quarrelled at last in circumstances deplorably infelicitous.\nNeither of these great creatures had the reticence to exclude the world\nfrom a narrative of their misfortunes and adventures; of the two it was\nfairly certainly the woman who came the less injured out of the furnace.\nIn \"Elle et Lui\" (1859) she gave long afterward her version of the\nunhappy and undignified story. Her stay in Venice appears to have\nimpressed her genius more deeply than any other section of her numerous\nforeign sojournings.\n\nThe writings of George Sand's second period, which extended from 1840\nto 1848, are of a more general character, and are tinged with a generous\nbut not very enlightened ardour for social emancipation. Of these\nnovels, the earliest is \"Le Compagnon du Tour de France\" (1840), which\nis scarcely a masterpiece. In the pursuit of foreign modes of thought,\nand impelled by experiences of travel, George Sand rose to far greater\nheights in \"Jeanne\" (1842), in \"Consuelo\" (1842-'43), and in \"La\nComtesse de Rudolstade\" (1844). All these books were composed in her\nretirement at Nohant, where she definitely settled in 1839, after\nhaving travelled for several months in Switzerland with Liszt and Mme.\nd'Agoult, and having lived in the island of Majorca for some time\nwith the dying Chopin, an episode which is enshrined in her \"Lucrezia\nFloriani\" (1847).\n\nThe Revolution of 1848 appeared to George Sand a realization of her\nUtopian dreams, and plunged her thoughts into a painful disorder. She\nsoon, however, became dissatisfied with the result of her republican\ntheories, and she turned to two new sources of success, the country\nstory and the stage. Her delicious romance of \"Francois le Champi\"\n(1850) attracted a new and enthusiastic audience to her, and her entire\nemancipation from \"problems\" was marked in the pages of \"La Petite\nFadette\" and of \"La Mare au Diable.\" To the same period belong \"Les\nVisions de la Nuit des les Campagnes,\" \"Les Maitres Sonneurs,\" and\n\"Cosina.\" From 1850 to 1864 she gave a great deal of attention to\nthe theatre, and of her numerous pieces several enjoyed a wide and\nconsiderable success, although it cannot be said that any of her plays\nhave possessed the vitality of her best novels. The most solid of the\nformer was her dramatization of her story, \"Le Marquis de Villemer\"\n(1864), which was one of the latest, and next to it \"Le Mariage de\nVictorine\" (1851), which was one of the earliest. Her successes on the\nstage, such as they are, appear mainly due to collaboration with others.\n\nIn her latest period, from 1860 to 1876, George Sand returned to\nher first lyrical manner, although with more reticence and a wider\nexperience of life. Of the very abundant fruitage of these last years,\nnot many rank with the masterpieces of her earlier periods, although\nsuch novels as \"Tamaris\" (1862), \"La Confession d'une Jeune Fille\"\n(1865), and \"Cadio,\" seemed to her admirers to show no decline of force\nor fire. Still finer, perhaps, were \"Le Marquis de Villemer\" (1861) and\n\"Jean de la Roche\" (1860). Her latest production, which appeared after\nher death, was the \"Contes d'une Grand'mere,\" a collection full of\nhumanity and beauty. George Sand died at Nohant on the 8th of June,\n1876. She had great qualities of soul, and in spite of the naive\nirregularities of her conduct in early middle life, she cannot\nbe regarded otherwise than as an excellent woman. She was brave,\ncourageous, heroically industrious, a loyal friend, a tender and wise\nmother. Her principle fault has been wittily defined by Mr. Henry James,\nwho has remarked that in affairs of the heart George Sand never \"behaved\nlike a gentleman.\"\n\nE. G.\n\n\n\n\nPREFACE\n\nWhen I wrote my novel _Mauprat_ at Nohant--in 1846, if I remember\nrightly--I had just been suing for a separation. Hitherto I had written\nmuch against the abuses of marriage, and perhaps, though insufficiently\nexplaining my views, had induced a belief that I failed to appreciate\nits essence; but it was at this time that marriage itself stood before\nme in all the moral beauty of its principle.\n\nMisfortune is not without its uses to the thoughtful mind. The more\nclearly I had realized the pain and pity of having to break a sacred\nbond, the more profoundly I felt that where marriage is wanting, is\nin certain elements of happiness and justice of too lofty a nature to\nappeal to our actual society. Nay, more; society strives to take from\nthe sanctity of the institution by treating it as a contract of material\ninterests, attacking it on all sides at once, by the spirit of its\nmanners, by its prejudices, by its hypocritical incredulity.\n\nWhile writing a novel as an occupation and distraction for my mind, I\nconceived the idea of portraying an exclusive and undying love, before,\nduring, and after marriage. Thus I drew the hero of my book proclaiming,\nat the age of eighty, his fidelity to the one woman he had ever loved.\n\nThe ideal of love is assuredly eternal fidelity. Moral and religious\nlaws have aimed at consecrating this ideal. Material facts obscure it.\nCivil laws are so framed as to make it impossible or illusory. Here,\nhowever, is not the place to prove this. Nor has _Mauprat_ been burdened\nwith a proof of the theory; only, the sentiment by which I was specially\npenetrated at the time of writing it is embodied in the words of\n_Mauprat_ towards the end of the book: \"She was the only woman I loved\nin all my life; none other ever won a glance from me, or knew the\npressure of my hand.\"\n\nGEORGE SAND.\n\nJune 5, 1857.\n\n\n\nTO\n\nGUSTAVE PAPET\n\nThough fashion may proscribe the patriarchal fashion of dedications, I\nwould ask you, brother and friend, to accept this of a tale which is not\nnew to you. I have drawn my materials in part from the cottages of our\nNoire valley. May we live and die there, repeating every evening our\nbeloved invocation:\n\nSANCTA SIMPLICITAS!\n\nGEORGE SAND.\n\n\n\n\n\nMAUPRAT\n\n\nOn the borders of La Marche and Berry, in the district known as\nVarenne, which is naught but a vast moor studded with forests of oak\nand chestnut, and in the most thickly wooded and wildest part of the\ncountry, may be found, crouching within a ravine, a little ruined\nchateau. The dilapidated turrets would not catch your eye until you were\nabout a hundred yards from the principal portcullis. The venerable trees\naround and the scattered rocks above, bury it in everlasting obscurity;\nand you would experience the greatest difficulty, even in broad\ndaylight, in crossing the deserted path leading to it, without stumbling\nagainst the gnarled trunks and rubbish that bar every step. The name\ngiven to this dark ravine and gloomy castle is Roche-Mauprat.\n\nIt was not so long ago that the last of the Mauprats, the heir to this\nproperty, had the roofing taken away and all the woodwork sold. Then,\nas if to give a kick to the memory of his ancestors, he ordered the\nentrance gate to be thrown down, the north tower to be gutted, and a\nbreach to be made in the surrounding wall. This done, he departed with\nhis workmen, shaking the dust from off his feet, and abandoning his\ndomain to foxes, and cormorants, and vipers. Since then, whenever the\nwood-cutters and charcoal-burners from the huts in the neighbourhood\npass along the top of the Roche-Mauprat ravine, if it is in daytime they\nwhistle with a defiant air or hurl a hearty curse at the ruins; but\nwhen day falls and the goat-sucker begins to screech from the top of\nthe loopholes, wood-cutter and charcoal-burner pass by silently, with\nquickened step, and cross themselves from time to time to ward off the\nevil spirits that hold sway among the ruins.\n\nFor myself, I own that I have never skirted the ravine at night without\nfeeling a certain uneasiness; and I would not like to swear that on some\nstormy nights I have not given my horse a touch of the spur, in order\nto escape the more quickly from the disagreeable impression this\nneighbourhood made on me.\n\nThe reason is that in childhood I classed the name of Mauprat with those\nof Cartouche and Bluebeard; and in the course of horrible dreams I often\nused to mix up the ancient legends of the Ogre and the Bogey with the\nquite recent events which in our province had given such a sinister\nlustre to this Mauprat family.\n\nFrequently, out shooting, when my companions and I have left our posts\nto go and warm ourselves at the charcoal fires which the workmen keep\nup all night, I have heard this name dying away on their lips at our\napproach. But when they had recognised us and thoroughly satisfied\nthemselves that the ghosts of none of these robbers were hiding in our\nmidst, they would tell us in a whisper such stories as might make one's\nhair stand on end, stories which I shall take good care not to pass on\nto you, grieved as I am that they should ever have darkened and pained\nmy own memory.\n\nNot that the story I am about to tell is altogether pleasant and\ncheerful. On the contrary, I must ask your pardon for unfolding so\nsombre a tale. Yet, in the impression which it has made on myself there\nis something so consoling and, if I may venture the phrase, so healthful\nto the soul, that you will excuse me, I hope, for the sake of the\nresult. Besides this is a story which has just been told to me. And now\nyou ask me for one. The opportunity is too good to be missed for one of\nmy laziness or lack of invention.\n\nIt was only last week that I met Bernard Mauprat, the last of the\nline, the man who, having long before severed himself from his infamous\nconnections, determined to demolish his manor as a sign of the horror\naroused in him by the recollections of childhood. This Bernard is one of\nthe most respected men in the province. He lives in a pretty house near\nChateauroux, in a flat country. Finding myself in the neighbourhood,\nwith a friend of mine who knows him, I expressed a wish to be\nintroduced; and my friend, promising me a hearty welcome, took me to his\nhouse then and there.\n\nI already knew in outline the remarkable history of this old man; but I\nhad always felt a keen desire to fill in the details, and above all to\nreceive them from himself. For me, the strange destiny of the man was\na philosophical problem to be solved. I therefore noticed his features,\nhis manners, and his home with peculiar interest.\n\nBernard Mauprat must be fully eighty-four, though his robust health, his\nupright figure, his firm step, and the absence of any infirmity might\nindicate some fifteen or twenty years less. His face would have appeared\nto me extremely handsome, had not a certain harshness of expression\nbrought before my eyes, in spite of myself, the shades of his fathers.\nI very much fear that, externally at all events, he must resemble them.\nThis he alone could have told us; for neither my friend nor myself had\nknown any other Mauprat. Naturally, however, we were very careful not to\ninquire.\n\nIt struck us that his servants waited on him with a promptitude and\npunctuality quite marvellous in Berrichon domestics. Nevertheless, at\nthe least semblance of delay he raised his voice, knitted his eyebrows\n(which still showed very black under his white hair), and muttered a few\nexpressions of impatience which lent wings even to the slowest. At first\nI was somewhat shocked at this habit; it appeared to savour rather too\nstrongly of the Mauprats. But the kindly and almost paternal manner in\nwhich he spoke to them a moment later, and their zeal, which seemed so\ndistinct from fear, soon reconciled me to him. Towards us, moreover, he\nshowed an exquisite politeness, and expressed himself in the choicest\nterms. Unfortunately, at the end of dinner, a door which had been left\nopen and through which a cold air found its way to his venerable skull,\ndrew from him such a frightful oath that my friend and I exchanged a\nlook of surprise. He noticed it.\n\n\"I beg your pardon, gentlemen,\" he said. \"I am afraid you find me an odd\nmixture. Ah, you see but a short distance. I am an old branch, happily\ntorn from a vile trunk and transplanted into good soil, but still\nknotted and rough like the wild holly of the original stock. I have,\nbelieve me, had no little trouble in reaching the state of comparative\ngentleness and calm in which you behold me. Alas! if I dared, I should\nreproach Providence with a great injustice--that of having allotted me\na life as short as other men's. When one has to struggle for forty or\nfifty years to transform one's self from a wolf into a man, one ought to\nlive a hundred years longer to enjoy one's victory. Yet what good\nwould that do me?\" he added in a tone of sadness. \"The kind fairy who\ntransformed me is here no more to take pleasure in her work. Bah! it is\nquite time to have done with it all.\"\n\nThen he turned towards me, and, looking at me with big dark eyes, still\nstrangely animated, said:\n\n\"Come, my dear young man; I know what brings you to see me; you are\ncurious to hear my history. Draw nearer the fire, then. Mauprat though\nI am, I will not make you do duty for a log. In listening you are giving\nme the greatest pleasure you could give. Your friend will tell you,\nhowever, that I do not willingly talk of myself. I am generally afraid\nof having to deal with blockheads, but you I have already heard of;\nI know your character and your profession; you are an observer and\nnarrator--in other words, pardon me, inquisitive and a chatterbox.\"\n\nHe began to laugh, and I made an effort to laugh too, though with\na rising suspicion that he was making game of us. Nor could I help\nthinking of the nasty tricks that his grandfather took a delight in\nplaying on the imprudent busybodies who called upon him. But he put his\narm through mine in a friendly way, and making me sit down in front of a\ngood fire, near a table covered with cups--\n\n\"Don't be annoyed,\" he said. \"At my age I cannot get rid of hereditary\nsarcasm; but there is nothing spiteful in mine. To speak seriously, I am\ndelighted to see you and to confide in you the story of my life. A man\nas unfortunate as I have been deserves to find a faithful biographer to\nclear his memory from all stain. Listen, then, and take some coffee.\"\n\nI offered him a cup in silence. He refused it with a wave of the arm\nand a smile which seemed to say, \"That is rather for your effeminate\ngeneration.\"\n\nThen he began his narrative in these words:\n\n\n\n\nI\n\nYou live not very far from Roche-Mauprat, and must have often passed by\nthe ruins. Thus there is no need for me to describe them. All I can tell\nyou is that the place has never been so attractive as it is now. On the\nday that I had the roof taken off, the sun for the first time brightened\nthe damp walls within which my childhood was passed; and the lizards\nto which I have left them are much better housed there than I once was.\nThey can at least behold the light of day and warm their cold limbs in\nthe rays of the sun at noon.\n\nThere used to be an elder and a younger branch of the Mauprats. I belong\nto the elder. My grandfather was that old Tristan de Mauprat who ran\nthrough his fortune, dishonoured his name, and was such a blackguard\nthat his memory is already surrounded by a halo of the marvelous. The\npeasants still believe that his ghost appears, either in the body of a\nwizard who shows malefactors the way to the dwellings of Varenne, or in\nthat of an old white hare which reveals itself to people meditating\nsome evil deed. When I came into the world the only living member of the\nyounger branch was Monsieur Hubert de Mauprat, known as the chevalier,\nbecause he belonged to the Order of the Knights of Malta; a man just as\ngood as his cousin was bad. Being the youngest son of his family, he had\ntaken the vow of celibacy; but, when he found himself the sole survivor\nof several brothers and sisters, he obtained release from his vow, and\ntook a wife the year before I was born. Rumour says that before changing\nhis existence in this way he made strenuous efforts to find some\ndescendant of the elder branch worthy to restore the tarnished family\nname, and preserve the fortune which had accumulated in the hands of the\nyounger branch. He had endeavoured to put his cousin Tristan's affairs\nin order, and had frequently paid off the latter's creditors. Seeing,\nhowever, that the only effect of his kindness was to encourage the vices\nof the family, and that, instead of respect and gratitude, he received\nnothing but secret hatred and churlish jealousy, he abandoned all\nattempts at friendship, broke with his cousins, and in spite of his\nadvanced age (he was over sixty), took a wife in order to have heirs of\nhis own. He had one daughter, and there his hopes of posterity ended;\nfor soon afterward his wife died of a violent illness which the doctors\ncalled iliac passion. He then left that part of the country and returned\nbut rarely to his estates. These were situated about six leagues from\nRoche-Mauprat, on the borders of the Varenne du Fromental. He was a\nprudent man and a just, because he was cultured, because his father had\nmoved with the spirit of his century, and had had him educated. None the\nless he had preserved a firm character and an enterprising mind, and,\nlike his ancestors, he was proud of hearing as a sort of surname the\nknightly title of Headbreaker, hereditary in the original Mauprat stock.\nAs for the elder branch, it had turned out so badly, or rather had\npreserved from the old feudal days such terrible habits of brigandage,\nthat it had won for itself the distinctive title of Hamstringer. [I\nhazard \"Headbreaker\" and \"Hamstringer\" as poor equivalents for the\n\"Casse-Tete\" and \"Coupe-Jarret\" of the French.--TR.] Of the sons of\nTristan, my father, the eldest, was the only one who married. I was his\nonly child. Here it is necessary to mention a fact of which I was long\nignorant. Hubert de Mauprat, on hearing of my birth, begged me of my\nparents, undertaking to make me his heir if he were allowed absolute\ncontrol over my education. At a shooting-party about this time my\nfather was killed by an accidental shot, and my grandfather refused the\nchevalier's offer, declaring that his children were the sole legitimate\nheirs of the younger branch, and that consequently he would resist with\nall his might any substitution in my favour. It was then that Hubert's\ndaughter was born. But when, seven years later, his wife died leaving\nhim this one child, the desire, so strong in the nobles of that time, to\nperpetuate their name, urged him to renew his request to my mother. What\nher answer was I do not know; she fell ill and died. The country doctors\nagain brought in a verdict of iliac passion. My grandfather had spent\nthe last two days she passed in this world with her.\n\nPour me out a glass of Spanish wine; for I feel a cold shiver running\nthrough my body. It is nothing serious--merely the effect that these\nearly recollections have on me when I begin to narrate them. It will\nsoon pass off.\n\nHe swallowed a large glass of wine, and we did the same; for a sensation\nof cold came upon us too as we gazed at his stern face and listened to\nhis brief, abrupt sentences. He continued:\n\nThus at the age of seven I found myself an orphan. My grandfather\nsearched my mother's house and seized all the money and valuables he\ncould carry away. Then, leaving the rest, and declaring he would have\nnothing to do with lawyers, he did not even wait for the funeral, but\ntook me by the collar and flung me on to the crupper of his horse,\nsaying: \"Now, my young ward, come home with me; and try to stop that\ncrying soon, for I haven't much patience with brats.\" In fact, after\na few seconds he gave me such hard cuts with his whip that I stopped\ncrying, and, withdrawing myself like a tortoise into my shell, completed\nthe journey without daring to breathe.\n\nHe was a tall old man, bony and cross-eyed. I fancy I see him now as he\nwas then. The impression that evening made on me can never be effaced.\nIt was a sudden realization of all the horrors which my mother had\nforeshadowed when speaking of her execrable father-in-law and his\nbrigands of sons. The moon, I remember, was shining here and there\nthrough the dense foliage of the forest. My grandfather's horse was\nlean, hardy, and bad-tempered like himself. It kicked at every cut of\nthe whip, and its master gave it plenty. Swift as an arrow it jumped the\nravines and little torrents which everywhere intersect Varenne in all\ndirections. At each jump I lost my balance, and clung in terror to the\nsaddle or my grandfather's coat. As for him, he was so little concerned\nabout me that, had I fallen, I doubt whether he would have taken the\ntrouble to pick me up. Sometimes, noticing my terror, he would jeer at\nme, and, to make me still more afraid, set his horse plunging again.\nTwenty times, in a frenzy of despair, I was on the point of throwing\nmyself off; but the instinctive love of life prevented me from giving\nway to the impulse. At last, about midnight, we suddenly stopped before\na small pointed gate, and the drawbridge was soon lifted behind us. My\ngrandfather took me, bathed in a cold sweat as I was, and threw me\nover to a great fellow, lame and horribly ugly, who carried me into the\nhouse. This was my Uncle John, and I was at Roche-Mauprat.\n\nAt that time my grandfather, along with his eight sons, formed the last\nrelic in our province of that race of petty feudal tyrants by\nwhich France had been overrun and harassed for so many centuries.\nCivilization, already advancing rapidly towards the great convulsion of\nthe Revolution, was gradually stamping out the systematic extortions\nof these robbers. The light of education, a species of good taste\nreflected, however dimly, from a polished court, and perhaps a\npresentiment of the impending terrible awakening of the people, were\nspreading through the castles and even through the half-rustic manors\nof the lordlings. Ever in our midland provinces, the most backward by\nreason of their situation, the sentiment of social equality was\nalready driving out the customs of a barbarous age. More than one vile\nscapegrace had been forced to reform, in spite of his privileges; and\nin certain places where the peasants, driven to desperation, had rid\nthemselves of their overlord, the law had not dreamt of interfering, nor\nhad the relatives dared to demand redress.\n\nIn spite of the prevailing tone of mind, my grandfather had long\nmaintained his position in the country without experiencing any\nopposition. But, having had a large family, endowed like himself with a\ngoodly number of vices, he finally found himself pestered and besieged\nby creditors who, instead of being frightened by his threats, as of old,\nwere themselves threatening to make him suffer. He was obliged to devise\nsome means of avoiding the bailiffs on the one hand, and, on the other,\nthe fights which were continually taking place. In these fights the\nMauprats no longer shone, despite their numbers, their complete union,\nand their herculean strength; since the whole population of the district\nsided with their opponents and took upon itself the duty of stoning\nthem. So, rallying his progeny around him, as the wild boar gathers\ntogether its young after a hunt, Tristan withdrew into his castle and\nordered the drawbridge to be raised. Shut up with him were ten or twelve\npeasants, his servants, all of them poachers or refugees, who like\nhimself had some interest in \"retiring from the world\" (his own\nexpression), and in finding a place of safety behind good stout walls.\nAn enormous pile of hunting weapons, duck-guns, carbines, blunderbusses,\nspears, and cutlasses, were raised on the platform, and the porter\nreceived orders never to let more than two persons at a time approach\nwithin range of his gun.\n\nFrom that day Mauprat and his sons broke with all civil laws as they had\nalready broken with all moral laws. They formed themselves into a band\nof adventurers. While their well-beloved and trusty poachers supplied\nthe house with game, they levied illegal taxes on the small farms in the\nneighbourhood. Now, without being cowards (and they are far from that),\nthe peasants of our province, as you know, are meek and timid, partly\nfrom listlessness, partly from distrust of the law, which they have\nnever understood, and of which even to this day they have but a scanty\nknowledge. No province of France has preserved more old traditions or\nlonger endured the abuses of feudalism. Nowhere else, perhaps, has the\ntitle of the lord of the manor been handed down, as hitherto with us, to\nthe owners of certain estates; and nowhere is it so easy to frighten the\npeople with reports of some absurd and impossible political event. At\nthe time of which I speak the Mauprats, being the only powerful family\nin a district remote from towns and cut off from communication with the\noutside world, had little difficulty in persuading their vassals that\nserfdom was about to be re-established, and that it would go hard with\nall who resisted. The peasants hesitated, listened timorously to the few\namong themselves who preached independence, then thought the matter over\nand decided to submit. The Mauprats were clever enough not to demand\nmoney of them, for money is what the peasant in such a district\nobtains with the greatest difficulty, and parts from with the greatest\nreluctance. \"Money is dear,\" is one of his proverbs, because in his\neyes money stands for something different from manual labour. It means\ntraffic with men and things outside his world, an effort of foresight or\ncircumspection, a bargain, a sort of intellectual struggle, which lifts\nhim out of his ordinary heedless habits; it means, in a word, mental\nlabour, and this for him is the most painful and the most wearing.\n\nThe Mauprats, knowing how the ground lay, and having no particular need\nof money any longer, since they had repudiated their debts, demanded\npayments in kind only. They ruled that one man should contribute capons,\nanother calves, a third corn, a fourth fodder, and so on. They were\ncareful, too, to tax judiciously, to demand from each the commodity\nhe could provide with least inconvenience to himself. In return they\npromised help and protection to all; and up to a certain point they kept\ntheir word. They cleared the land of wolves and foxes, gave a welcome\nand a hiding-place to all deserters, and helped to defraud the state by\nintimidating the excise officers and tax-collectors.\n\nThey took advantage of their power to give the poor man a false notion\nof his real interests, and to corrupt the simple folk by undermining all\nsense of their dignity and natural liberty. They made the whole district\ncombine in a sort of secession from the law, and they so frightened\nthe functionaries appointed to enforce respect for it, that after a few\nyears it fell into a veritable desuetude. Thus it happened that, while\nFrance at a short distance from this region was advancing with rapid\nstrides towards the enfranchisement of the poorer classes, Varenne was\nexecuting a retrograde march and returning at full speed to the ancient\ntyranny of the country squires. It was easy enough for the Mauprats to\npervert these poor folk; they feigned a friendly interest in them\nto mark their difference from the other nobles in the province whose\nmanners still retained some of the haughtiness of their ancient power.\nAbove all, my grandfather lost no opportunity of making the peasants\nshare his own hatred of his own cousin, Hubert de Mauprat. The latter,\nwhenever he interviewed his vassals, would remain seated in his\narm-chair, while they stood before him bareheaded; whereas Tristan de\nMauprat would make them sit down at his table, and drink some of the\nwine they had brought him as a sign of voluntary homage. He would then\nhave them led home by his men in the middle of the night, all dead\ndrunk, torches in hand, and making the forest resound with ribald songs.\nLibertinism completed the demoralization of the peasantry. In every\nfamily the Mauprats soon had their mistresses. This was tolerated,\npartly because it was profitable, and partly (alas! that it should\nhave to be said) because it gratified vanity. The very isolation of the\nhouses was favourable to the evil. No scandal, no denunciation were\nto be feared. The tiniest village would have been sufficient for the\ncreation and maintenance of a public opinion. There, however, there\nwere only scattered cottages and isolated farms; wastes and woods so\nseparated the families from one another that the exercise of any mutual\ncontrol was impossible. Shame is stronger than conscience. I need not\ntell you of all the bonds of infamy that united masters and slaves.\nDebauchery, extortion, and fraud were both precept and example for my\nyouth, and life went on merrily. All notions of justice were scoffed at;\ncreditors were defrauded of both interest and capital; any law officer\nwho ventured to serve a summons received a sound thrashing, and the\nmounted police were fired on if they approached too near the turrets. A\nplague on parliament; starvation to all imbued with the new philosophy;\nand death to the younger branch of the Mauprats--such were the\nwatchwords of these men who, to crown all, gave themselves the airs of\nknights-errant of the twelfth century. My grandfather talked of nothing\nbut his pedigree and the prowess of his ancestors. He regretted the good\nold days when every lordling had instruments of torture in his manor,\nand dungeons, and, best, of all cannon. In ours we only had pitchforks\nand sticks, and a second-rate culverin which my Uncle John used to\npoint--and point very well, in fact--and which was sufficient to keep at\na respectful distance the military force of the district.\n\n\n\n\nII\n\nOld Mauprat was a treacherous animal of the carnivorous order, a\ncross between a lynx and a fox. Along with a copious and easy flow of\nlanguage, he had a veneer of education which helped his cunning. He made\na point of excessive politeness, and had great powers of persuasion,\neven with the objects of his vengeance. He knew how to entice them to\nhis castle, where he would make them undergo frightful ill-treatment,\nfor which, however, having no witnesses, they were unable to obtain\nredress by law. All his villainies bore the stamp of such consummate\nskill that the country came to view them with a sort of awe akin to\nrespect. No one could ever catch him out of his den, though he issued\nforth often enough, and apparently without taking many precautions. In\ntruth, he was a man with a genius for evil; and his sons, bound to him\nby no ties of affection, of which, indeed, they were incapable, yet\nacknowledged the sway of this superior evil genius, and gave him\na uniform and ready obedience, in which there was something almost\nfanatic. He was their deliverer in all desperate cases; and when the\nweariness of confinement under our chilly vaults began to fill them with\n_ennui_, his mind, brutal even in jest, would cure them by arranging\nfor their pleasure shows worthy of a den of thieves. Sometimes poor\nmendicant monks collecting alms would be terrified or tortured for their\nbenefit; their beards would be burned off, or they would be lowered into\na well and kept hanging between life and death until they had sung some\nfoul song or uttered some blasphemy. Everybody knows the story of the\nnotary who was allowed to enter in company with his four clerks, and\nwhom they received with all the assiduity of pompous hospitality. My\ngrandfather pretended to agree with a good grace to the execution of\ntheir warrant, and politely helped them to make an inventory of his\nfurniture, of which the sale had been decreed. After this, when dinner\nwas served and the king's men had taken their places at table, he said\nto the notary:\n\n\"Ah, mon Dieu! I was forgetting a poor hack of mine in the stable. It's\na small matter. Still, you might be reprimanded for omitting it; and\nas I see that you are a worthy fellow I should be sorry to mislead you.\nCome with me and see it; it won't take us a moment.\"\n\nThe notary followed Mauprat unsuspectingly. Just as they were about to\nenter the stable together, Mauprat, who was leading the way, told him to\nput in his head only. The notary, anxious to show great consideration in\nthe performance of his duties, and not to pry into things too closely,\ndid as he was told. Then Mauprat suddenly pushed the door to and\nsqueezed his neck so violently between it and the wall that the wretched\nman could not breathe. Deeming him sufficiently punished, Tristan opened\nthe door again, and, asking pardon for his carelessness, with great\ncivility offered the man his arm to take him back to dinner. This the\nnotary did not consider it wise to refuse; but as soon as he re-entered\nthe room where his colleagues were, he threw himself into a chair, and\npointing to his livid face and mangled neck, demanded justice for the\ntrap into which he had just been led. It was then that my grandfather,\nrevelling in his rascally wit, went through a comedy scene of sublime\naudacity. He gravely reproached the notary with accusing him unjustly,\nand always addressing him kindly and with studied politeness, called the\nothers to bear witness to his conduct, begging them to make allowances\nif his precarious position had forced him to give them such a poor\nreception, all the while doing the honours of the table in splendid\nstyle. The poor notary did not dare to press the matter and was\ncompelled to dine, although half dead. His companions were so completely\nduped by Mauprat's assurance that they ate and drank merrily, treating\nthe notary as a lunatic and a boor. They left Roche-Mauprat all drunk,\nsinging the praises of their host, and laughing at the notary, who fell\ndown dead upon the threshold of his house on dismounting from his horse.\n\nThe eight sons, the pride and strength of old Mauprat, all resembled\nhim in physical vigour, brutality of manners, and, to some extent, in\ncraftiness and jesting ill-nature. The truth is they were veritable\nbrutes, capable of any evil, and completely dead to any noble thought\nor generous sentiment. Nevertheless, they were endowed with a sort of\nreckless, dashing courage which now and then seemed to have in it an\nelement of grandeur. But it is time that I told you about myself, and\ngave you some idea of the development of my character in the thick of\nthis filthy mire into which it had pleased God to plunge me, on leaving\nmy cradle.\n\nI should be wrong if, in order to gain your sympathy in these early\nyears of my life, I asserted that I was born with a noble nature, a pure\nand incorruptible soul. As to this, I know nothing. Maybe there are no\nincorruptible souls. Maybe there are. That is what neither you nor any\none will ever know. The great questions awaiting an answer are these:\n\"Are our innate tendencies invincible? If not, can they be modified\nmerely or wholly destroyed by education?\" For myself, I would not dare\nto affirm. I am neither a metaphysician, nor a psychologist, nor a\nphilosopher; but I have had a terrible life, gentlemen, and if I were a\nlegislator, I would order that man to have his tongue torn out, or\nhis head cut off, who dared to preach or write that the nature of\nindividuals is unchangeable, and that it is no more possible to reform\nthe character of a man than the appetite of a tiger. God has preserved\nme from believing this.\n\nAll I can tell you is that my mother instilled into me good principles,\nthough, perhaps, I was not endowed by nature with her good qualities.\nEven with her I was of a violent disposition, but my violence was\nsullen and suppressed. I was blind and brutal in anger, nervous even to\ncowardice at the approach of danger, daring almost to foolhardiness when\nhand to hand with it--that is to say, at once timid and brave from my\nlove of life. My obstinacy was revolting; yet my mother alone could\nconquer me; and without attempting to reason, for my mind developed very\nslowly, I used to obey her as if by a sort of magnetic necessity. This\none guiding hand which I remember, and another woman's which I felt\nlater, were and have been sufficient to lead me towards good. But I lost\nmy mother before she had been able to teach me anything seriously; and\nwhen I was transplanted to Roche-Mauprat, my feeling for the evil done\nthere was merely an instinctive aversion, feeble enough, perhaps, if\nfear had not been mingled with it.\n\nBut I thank Heaven from the bottom of my heart for the cruelties\nheaped upon me there, and above all for the hatred which my Uncle John\nconceived for me. My ill-fortune preserved me from indifference in\nthe presence of evil, and my sufferings helped me to detest those who\nwrought it.\n\nThis John was certainly the most detestable of his race. Ever since a\nfall from his horse had maimed him, his evil temper had developed\nin proportion to his inability to do as much harm as his companions.\nCompelled to remain at home when the others set out on their\nexpeditions, for he could not bestride a horse, he found his only chance\nof pleasure in those fruitless little attacks which the mounted police\nsometimes made on the castle, as if to ease their conscience. Then,\nintrenched behind a rampart of freestone which he had had built to\nsuit himself, John, calmly seated near his culverin, would pick off\na gentleman from time to time, and at once regain, as he said, his\nsleeping and eating power, which want of exercise had taken from him.\nAnd he would even climb up to his beloved platform without waiting for\nthe excuse of an attack, and there, crouching down like a cat ready to\nspring, as soon as he saw any one appear in the distance without giving\nthe signal, he would try his skill upon the target, and make the man\nretrace his steps. This he called sweeping the path clean.\n\nAs I was too young to accompany my uncles on their hunting and\nplundering expeditions, John naturally became my guardian and\ntutor--that is to say, my jailor and tormentor. I will not give you all\nthe details of that infernal existence. For nearly ten years I endured\ncold, hunger, insults, the dungeon, and blows, according to the more or\nless savage caprices of this monster. His fierce hatred of me arose\nfrom the fact that he could not succeed in depraving me; my rugged,\nheadstrong, and unsociable nature preserved me from his vile seductions.\nIt is possible that I had not any strong tendencies to virtue; to hatred\nI luckily had. Rather than do the bidding of my tyrant I would have\nsuffered a thousand deaths. And so I grew up without conceiving any\naffection for vice. However, my notions about society were so strange\nthat my uncles' mode of life did not in itself cause me any repugnance.\nSeeing that I was brought up behind the walls of Roche-Mauprat, and that\nI lived in a state of perpetual siege, you will understand that I had\nprecisely such ideas as any armed retainer in the barbarous ages of\nfeudalism might have had. What, outside our den, was termed by other men\nassassinating, plundering, and torturing, I was taught to call fighting,\nconquering, and subduing. My sole knowledge of history consisted of\nan acquaintance with certain legends and ballads of chivalry which my\ngrandfather used to repeat to me of an evening, when he had time to\nthink of what he was pleased to call my education. Whenever I asked him\nany question about the present time, he used to answer that times had\nsadly changed, that all Frenchmen had become traitors and felons, that\nthey had frightened their kings, and that these, like cravens, had\ndeserted the nobles, who in their turn had been cowardly enough to\nrenounce their privileges and let laws be made for them by clodhoppers.\nI listened with surprise, almost with indignation, to this account of\nthe age in which I lived, for me an age of shadows and mysteries. My\ngrandfather had but vague ideas of chronology; not a book of any kind\nwas to be found at Roche-Mauprat, except, I should say, the History of\nthe Sons of Aymon, and a few chronicles of the same class brought by our\nservants from country fairs. Three names, and only three, stood clear in\nthe chaos of my ignorance--Charlemagne, Louis XI, and Louis XIV; because\nmy grandfather would frequently introduce these into dissertations on\nthe unrecognised rights of the nobles. In truth, I was so ignorant that\nI scarcely knew the difference between a reign and a race; and I was by\nno means sure that my grandfather had not seen Charlemagne, for he spoke\nof him more frequently and more gladly than of any other man.\n\nBut, while my native energy led me to admire the exploits of my uncles,\nand filled me with a longing to share in them, the cold-blooded cruelty\nthey perpetrated on returning from their expeditions, and the perfidious\nartifices by which they lured their dupes to the castle, in order\nto torture them to extort ransom, roused in me strange and painful\nemotions, which, now that I am speaking in all sincerity, it would be\ndifficult for me to account for exactly. In the absence of all ordinary\nmoral principles it might have been natural for me to accept the theory\nwhich I daily saw carried into practice, that makes it right; but the\nhumiliation and suffering which my Uncle John inflicted on me in virtue\nof this theory, taught me to be dissatisfied with it. I could appreciate\nthe right of the bravest, and I genuinely despised those who, with death\nin their power, yet chose life at the price of such ignominy as they\nhad to bear at Roche-Mauprat. But I could only explain these insults and\nhorrors heaped on prisoners, some of them women and mere children,\nas manifestations of bloodthirsty appetites. I do not know if I was\nsufficiently susceptible of a noble sentiment to be inspired with pity\nfor the victim; but certain it is that I experienced that feeling\nof selfish commiseration which is common to all natures, and which,\npurified and ennobled, has become charity among civilized peoples. Under\nmy coarse exterior my heart no doubt merely felt passing shocks of fear\nand disgust at the sight of punishments which I myself might have to\nendure any day at the caprice of my oppressors; especially as John,\nwhen he saw me turn pale at these frightful spectacles, had a habit of\nsaying, in a mocking tone:\n\n\"That's what I'll do to you when you are disobedient.\"\n\nAll I know is that in presence of such iniquitous acts I experienced a\nhorrible uneasiness; my blood curdled in my veins, my throat began\nto close, and I had to rush away, so as not to repeat the cries which\npierced my ears. In time, however, I became somewhat hardened to these\nterrible impressions. The fibres of feeling grew tougher, and habit gave\nme power to hide what they termed my cowardice. I even felt ashamed of\nthe signs of weakness I showed, and forced my face into the hyena\nsmile which I saw on the faces of my kinsmen. But I could never prevent\nconvulsive shudders from running through my limbs, and the coldness as\nof death from falling on my heart, at the recollection of these scenes\nof agony. The women, dragged half-willingly, half by force, under the\nroof of Roche-Mauprat, caused me inconceivable agitation. I began to\nfeel the fires of youth kindling within me, and even to look with envy\non this part of my uncles' spoil; but with these new-born desires were\nmingled inexpressible pangs. To all around me women were merely objects\nof contempt, and vainly did I try to separate this idea from that of the\npleasure which was luring me. My mind was bewildered, and my irritated\nnerves imparted a violent and sickly strain to all my temptations. In\nother matters, I had as vile a disposition as my companions; if my heart\nwas better than theirs, my manners were no less arrogant, and my jokes\nin no better taste. And here it may be well to give you an illustration\nof my youthful malice, especially as the results of these events have\nhad an influence on the rest of my life.\n\n\n\n\nIII\n\nSome three leagues from Roche-Mauprat, on your way to Fromental, you\nmust have noticed an old tower standing by itself in the middle of the\nwoods. It is famous for the tragic death of a prisoner about a century\nago. The executioner, on his rounds, thought good to hang him without\nany further formality, merely to gratify an old Mauprat, his overlord.\n\nAt the time of which I am speaking Gazeau Tower was already deserted\nand falling into ruins. It was state property, and, more from negligence\nthan kindness, the authorities had allowed a poor old fellow to take\nup his abode there. He was quite a character, used to live completely\nalone, and was known in the district as Gaffer Patience.\n\n\"Yes,\" I interrupted; \"I have heard my nurse's grandmother speak of him;\nshe believed he was a sorcerer.\"\n\nExactly so; and while we are at this point let me tell you what sort of\na man this Patience really was, for I shall have to speak of him more\nthan once in the course of my story. I had opportunities of studying him\nthoroughly.\n\nPatience, then, was a rustic philosopher. Heaven had endowed him with\na keen intellect, but he had had little education. By a sort of strange\nfatality, his brain had doggedly resisted the little instruction he\nmight have received. For instance, he had been to the Carmelite's school\nat ----, and instead of showing any aptitude for work, he had played\ntruant with a keener delight than any of his school-fellows. His was\nan eminently contemplative nature, kindly and indolent, but proud and\nalmost savage in its love of independence; religious, yet opposed to\nall authority; somewhat captious, very suspicious, and inexorable with\nhypocrites. The observances of the cloister inspired him with but little\nawe; and as a result of once or twice speaking his mind too freely to\nthe monks he was expelled from the school. From that time forth he was\nthe sworn foe of what he called monkism, and declared openly for the\ncure of the Briantes, who was accused of being a Jansenist. In the\ninstruction of Patience, however, the cure succeeded no better than the\nmonks. The young peasant, endowed though he was with herculean strength\nand a great desire for knowledge, displayed an unconquerable aversion\nfor every kind of work, whether physical or mental. He professed a sort\nof artless philosophy which the cure found it very difficult to argue\nagainst. There was, he said, no need for a man to work as long as he did\nnot want money; and he was in no need of money as long as his wants were\nmoderate. Patience practised what he preached: during the years when\npassions are so powerful he lived a life of austerity, drank nothing\nbut water, never entered a tavern, and never joined in a dance. He was\nalways very awkward and shy with women, who, it must be owned, found\nlittle to please in his eccentric character, stern face, and somewhat\nsarcastic wit. As if to avenge himself for this by showing his contempt,\nor to console himself by displaying his wisdom, he took a pleasure, like\nDiogenes of old, in decrying the vain pleasures of others; and if at\ntimes he was to be seen passing under the branches in the middle of the\nfetes, it was merely to throw out some shaft of scorn, a flash from his\ninexorable good sense. Sometimes, too, his uncompromising morality found\nexpression in biting words, which left clouds of sadness or fear hanging\nover agitated consciences. This naturally gained him violent enemies;\nand the efforts of impotent hatred, helped by the feeling of awe which\nhis eccentric behaviour produced, fastened upon him the reputation of a\nsorcerer.\n\nWhen I said that Patience was lacking in education, I expressed myself\nbadly. Longing for a knowledge of the sublime mysteries of Nature,\nhis mind wished to soar to heaven on its first flight. From the very\nbeginning, the Jansenist vicar was so perplexed and startled by\nthe audacity of his pupil, he had to say so much to calm him into\nsubmission, he was obliged to sustain such assaults of bold questions\nand proud objections, that he had no leisure to teach him the alphabet;\nand at the end of ten years of studies, broken off and taken up at the\nbidding of a whim or on compulsion, Patience could not even read. It was\nonly with great difficulty, after poring over a book for some two hours,\nthat he deciphered a single page, and even then he did not grasp the\nmeaning of most of the words expressing abstract ideas. Yet these\nabstract ideas were undoubtedly in him; you felt their presence while\nwatching and listening to him; and the way in which he managed to embody\nthem in homely phrase enlivened with a rude poetry was so marvellous,\nthat one scarcely knew whether to feel astounded or amused.\n\nAlways serious, always positive himself, he scorned dalliance with\nany dialectic. A Stoic by nature and on principle, enthusiastic in the\npropagation of his doctrine of severance from false ideas, but resolute\nin the practice of resignation, he made many a breach in the poor cure's\ndefences; and it was in these discussions, as he often told me in his\nlast years, that he acquired his knowledge of philosophy. In order to\nmake a stand against the battering-ram of natural logic, the worthy\nJansenist was obliged to invoke the testimony of all the Fathers of the\nChurch, and to oppose these, often even to corroborate them, with the\nteaching of all the sages and scholars of antiquity. Then Patience, his\nround eyes starting from his head (this was his own expression), lapsed\ninto silence, and, delighted to learn without having the bother of\nstudying, would ask for long explanations of the doctrines of these\nmen, and for an account of their lives. Noticing this attention and\nthis silence, his adversary would exult; but just as he thought he had\nconvinced this rebellious soul, Patience, hearing the village clock\nstrike midnight, would rise, take an affectionate leave of his host, and\non the very threshold of the vicarage, would dismay the good man with\nsome laconic and cutting comment that confounded Saint Jerome and Plato\nalike, Eusebius equally with Seneca, Tertullian no less than Aristotle.\n\nThe cure was not too ready to acknowledge the superiority of this\nuntutored intellect. Still, he was quite astonished at passing so many\nwinter evenings by his fireside with this peasant without feeling\neither bored or tired; and he would wonder how it was that the village\nschoolmaster, and even the prior of the convent, in spite of their Greek\nand Latin, appeared to him, the one a bore, the other a sophist, in all\ntheir discussions. Knowing the perfect purity of the peasant's life,\nhe attributed the ascendency of his mind to the power of virtue and the\ncharm it spreads over all things. Then, each evening, he would humbly\naccuse himself before God of not having disputed with his pupil from a\nsufficiently Christian point of view; he would confess to his guardian\nangel that pride in his own learning and joy at being listened to\nso devoutly had carried him somewhat beyond the bounds of religious\ninstruction; that he had quoted profane writers too complacently;\nthat he had even experienced a dangerous pleasure in roaming with\nhis disciple through the fields of the past, plucking pagan flowers\nunsprinkled by the waters of baptism, flowers in whose fragrance a\npriest should not have found such delight.\n\nOn his side, Patience loved the cure dearly. He was his only friend,\nhis only bond of union with society, his only bond of union, through\nthe light of knowledge, with God. The peasant largely over-estimated his\npastor's learning. He did not know that even the most enlightened men\noften draw wrong conclusions, or no conclusions at all, from the course\nof progress. Patience would have been spared great distress of mind if\nhe could have seen for certain that his master was frequently mistaken\nand that it was the man, not the truth, that was at fault. Not knowing\nthis, and finding the experience of the ages at variance with his innate\nsense of justice, he was continually a prey to agonizing reveries; and,\nliving by himself, and wandering through the country at all hours of the\nday and night, wrapped in thoughts undreamed of by his fellows, he gave\nmore and more credit to the tales of sorcery reported against him.\n\nThe convent did not like the pastor. A few monks whom Patience had\nunmasked hated Patience. Hence, both pastor and pupil were persecuted.\nThe ignorant monks did not scruple to accuse the cure to his bishop of\ndevoting himself to the occult sciences in concert with the magician\nPatience. A sort of religious war broke out in the village and\nneighbourhood. All who were not for the convent were for the cure,\nand _vice versa_. Patience scorned to take part in this struggle. One\nmorning he went to see his friend, with tears in his eyes, and said to\nhim:\n\n\"You are the one man in all the world that I love, and I will not have\nyou persecuted on my account. Since, after you, I neither know nor\ncare for a soul, I am going off to live in the woods, like the men\nof primitive times. I have inherited a field which brings me in fifty\nfrancs a year. It is the only land I have ever stirred with these hands,\nand half its wretched rent has gone to pay the tithe of labour I owe the\nseignior. I trust to die without ever doing duty as a beast of burden\nfor others. And yet, should they remove you from your office, or rob you\nof your income, if you have a field that needs ploughing, only send me\nword, and you will see that these arms have not grown altogether stiff\nin their idleness.\"\n\nIt was in vain that the pastor opposed this resolve. Patience departed,\ncarrying with him as his only belonging the coat he had on his back,\nand an abridgment of the teachings of Epictetus. For this book he had a\ngreat affection, and, thanks to much study of it, could read as many\nas three of its pages a day without unduly tiring himself. The rustic\nanchorite went into the desert to live. At first he built himself a hut\nof branches in a wood. Then, as wolves attacked him, he took refuge in\none of the lower halls of Gazeau Tower, which he furnished luxuriously\nwith a bed of moss, and some stumps of trees; wild roots, wild fruit,\nand goat's milk constituted a daily fare very little inferior to what\nhe had had in the village. This is no exaggeration. You have to see the\npeasants in certain parts of Varenne to form an idea of the frugal diet\non which a man can live and keep in good health. In the midst of these\nmen of stoical habits all round him, Patience was still exceptional.\nNever had wine reddened his lips, and bread had seemed to him a\nsuperfluity. Besides, the doctrine of Pythagoras was not wholly\ndispleasing to him; and in the rare interviews which he henceforth had\nwith his friend he would declare that, without exactly believing in\nmetempsychosis, and without making it a rule to eat vegetables only, he\nfelt a secret joy at being able to live thus, and at having no further\noccasion to see death dealt out every day to innocent animals.\n\nPatience had formed this curious resolution at the age of forty. He was\nsixty when I saw him for the first time, and he was then possessed of\nextraordinary physical vigour. In truth, he was in the habit of roaming\nabout the country every year. However, in proportion as I tell you about\nmy own life, I shall give you details of the hermit life of Patience.\n\nAt the time of which I am about to speak, the forest rangers, more\nfrom fear of his casting a spell over them than out of compassion, had\nfinally ceased their persecutions, and given him full permission to\nlive in Gazeau Tower, not, however, without warning him that it would\nprobably fall about his head during the first gale of wind. To this\nPatience had replied philosophically that if he was destined to be\ncrushed to death, the first tree in the forest would do the work quite\nas well as the walls of Gazeau Tower.\n\nBefore putting my actor Patience on the stage, and with many apologies\nfor inflicting on you such a long preliminary biography, I have still to\nmention that during the twenty years of which I have spoken the cure's\nmind had bowed to a new power. He loved philosophy, and in spite of\nhimself, dear man, could not prevent this love from embracing the\nphilosophers too, even the least orthodox. The works of Jean Jacques\nRousseau carried him away into new regions, in spite of all his efforts\nat resistance; and when one morning, when returning from a visit to some\nsick folk, he came across Patience gathering his dinner of herbs from\nthe rocks of Crevant, he sat down near him on one of the druidical\nstones and made, without knowing it, the profession of faith of the\nSavoyard vicar. Patience drank more willingly of this poetic religion\nthan of the ancient orthodoxy. The pleasure with which he listened to\na summary of the new doctrines led the cure to arrange secret meetings\nwith him in isolated parts of Varenne, where they agreed to come\nupon each other as if by chance. At these mysterious interviews the\nimagination of Patience, fresh and ardent from long solitude, was fired\nwith all the magic of the thoughts and hopes which were then fermenting\nin France, from the court of Versailles to the most uninhabitable heath.\nHe became enamoured of Jean Jacques, and made the cure read as much of\nhim as he possibly could without neglecting his duties. Then he begged a\ncopy of the _Contrat Social_, and hastened to Gazeau Tower to spell his\nway through it feverishly. At first the cure had given him of this manna\nonly with a sparing hand, and while making him admire the lofty thoughts\nand noble sentiments of the philosopher, had thought to put him on his\nguard against the poison of anarchy. But all the old learning, all the\nhappy texts of bygone days--in a word, all the theology of the worthy\npriest--was swept away like a fragile bridge by the torrent of wild\neloquence and ungovernable enthusiasm which Patience had accumulated\nin his desert. The vicar had to give way and fall back terrified upon\nhimself. There he discovered that the shrine of his own science was\neverywhere cracking and crumbling to ruin. The new sun which was rising\non the political horizon and making havoc in so many minds, melted his\nown like a light snow under the first breath of spring. The sublime\nenthusiasm of Patience; the strange poetic life of the man which seemed\nto reveal him as one inspired; the romantic turn which their mysterious\nrelations were taking (the ignoble persecutions of the convent making it\nnoble to revolt)--all this so worked upon the priest that by 1770 he had\nalready travelled far from Jansenism, and was vainly searching all the\nreligious heresies for some spot on which he might rest before falling\ninto the abyss of philosophy so often opened at his feet by Patience, so\noften hidden in vain by the exorcisms of Roman theology.\n\n\n\n\nIV\n\nAfter this account of the philosophical life of Patience, set forth\nby me now in manhood (continued Bernard, after a pause), it is not\naltogether easy to return to the very different impressions I received\nin boyhood on meeting the wizard of Gazeau Tower. I will make an effort,\nhowever, to reproduce my recollections faithfully.\n\nIt was one summer evening, as I was returning from bird-snaring with\nseveral peasant-boys, that I passed Gazeau Tower for the first time.\nMy age was about thirteen, and I was bigger and stronger than any of my\ncomrades; besides, I exercised over them, sternly enough, the authority\nI drew from my noble birth. In fact, the mixture of familiarity and\netiquette in our intercourse was rather fantastic. Sometimes, when the\nexcitement of sport or the fatigue of the day had greater powers over\nthem than I, they used to have their own way; and I already knew how\nto yield at the right moment, as tyrants do, so as always to avoid the\nappearance of being compelled. However, I generally found a chance for\nrevenge, and soon saw them trembling before the hated name of my family.\n\nWell, night was coming on, and we were walking along gaily, whistling,\nknocking down crab-apples with stones, imitating the notes of birds,\nwhen the boy who was ahead suddenly stopped, and, coming back to us,\ndeclared that he was not going by the Gazeau Tower path, but would\nrather cut across the wood. This idea was favoured by two others. A\nthird objected that we ran the risk of losing ourselves if we left the\npath, that night was near, and that there were plenty of wolves about.\n\n\"Come on, you funks!\" I cried in a princely tone, pushing forward the\nguide; \"follow the path, and have done with this nonsense.\"\n\n\"Not me,\" said the youngster. \"I've just seen the sorcerer at his door\nsaying magic words, and I don't want to have a fever all the year.\"\n\n\"Bah!\" said another; \"he doesn't do harm to everybody. He never hurts\nchildren; and, besides, we have only to pass by very quietly without\nsaying anything to him. What do you suppose he'll do to us?\"\n\n\"Oh, it would be all right if we were alone,\" answered the first; \"but\nM. Bernard is here; we're sure to have a spell cast on us.\"\n\n\"What do you say, you fool?\" I cried, doubling my fist.\n\n\"It's not my fault, my lord,\" replied the boy. \"That old wretch doesn't\nlike the gentry, and he has said he would be glad to see M. Tristan and\nall his sons hanging from the same bough.\"\n\n\"He said that, did he? Good!\" I answered. \"Come on, and you shall see.\nAll who are my friends will follow; any one that leaves me is a coward.\"\n\nTwo of my companions, out of vanity, let themselves be drawn on. The\nothers pretended to imitate them; but, after a few steps, they had all\ntaken flight and disappeared into the copse. However, I went on proudly,\nescorted by my two acolytes. Little Sylvain, who was in front, took off\nhis hat as soon as he saw Patience in the distance; and when we arrived\nopposite him, though the man was looking on the ground without appearing\nto notice us, he was seized with terror, and said, in a trembling voice:\n\n\"Good evening, Master Patience; a good night's rest to you.\"\n\nThe sorcerer, roused out of his reverie, started like a man waked from\nsleep; and I saw, not without a certain emotion, his weather-beaten face\nhalf covered with a thick gray beard. His big head was quite bald, and\nthe bareness of his forehead only served to make his bushy eyebrows\nmore prominent. Behind these his round deepset eyes seemed to flash\nlike lightning at the end of summer behind the fading foliage. He was\nof small stature, but very broad-shouldered; in fact, built like a\ngladiator. The rags in which he was clad were defiantly filthy. His face\nwas short and of a vulgar type, like that of Socrates; and if the fire\nof genius glowed in his strongly marked features, I certainly could not\nperceive it. He appeared to me a wild beast, an unclean animal. Filled\nwith a sense of loathing, and determined to avenge the insult he had\noffered to my name, I put a stone in my sling, and without further ado\nhurled it at him with all my might.\n\nAt the moment the stone flew out, Patience was in the act of replying to\nthe boy's greeting.\n\n\"Good evening, lads; God be with you!\" he was saying when the stone\nwhistled past his ear and struck a tame owl of which Patience had made a\npet, and which at the approach of night was beginning to rouse itself in\nthe ivy above the door.\n\nThe owl gave a piercing cry and fell bleeding at the feet of its\nmaster, who answered it with a roar of anger. For a few seconds he stood\nmotionless with surprise and fury. Then suddenly, taking the palpitating\nvictim by the feet, he lifted it up, and, coming towards us, cried in a\nvoice of thunder:\n\n\"Which of you wretches threw that stone?\"\n\nThe boy who had been walking behind, flew with the swiftness of the\nwind; but Sylvain, seized by the great hand of the sorcerer, fell\nupon his knees, swearing by the Holy Virgin and by Saint Solange, the\npatroness of Berry, that he was innocent of the death of the bird. I\nfelt, I confess, a strong inclination to let him get out of the scrape\nas best he could, and make my escape into the thicket. I had expected\nto see a decrepit old juggler, not to fall into the hands of a robust\nenemy; but pride held me back.\n\n\"If you did this,\" said Patience to my trembling comrade, \"I pity you;\nfor you are a wicked child, and you will grow into a dishonest man. You\nhave done a bad deed; you have made it your pleasure to cause pain to\nan old man who never did you any harm; and you have done this\ntreacherously, like a coward, while feigning politeness and bidding him\ngood-evening. You are a liar, a miscreant; you have robbed me of my only\nsociety, my only riches; you have taken delight in evil. God preserve\nyou from living if you are going on in this way.\"\n\n\"Oh, Monsieur Patience!\" cried the boy, clasping his hands; \"do not\ncurse me; do not bewitch me; do not give me any illness; it wasn't I!\nMay God strike me dead if it was!\"\n\n\"If it wasn't you, it was this one, then!\" said Patience, seizing me by\nthe coat-collar and shaking me like a young tree to be uprooted.\n\n\"Yes, I did it,\" I replied, haughtily; \"and if you wish to know my name,\nlearn that I am called Bernard Mauprat, and that a peasant who lays a\nhand on a nobleman deserves death.\"\n\n\"Death! You! You would put me to death, Mauprat!\" cried the old man,\npetrified with surprise and indignation. \"And what would God be, then,\nif a brat like you had a right to threaten a man of my age? Death! Ah,\nyou are a genuine Mauprat, and you bite like your breed, cursed whelp!\nSuch things as they talk of putting to death the very moment they are\nborn! Death, my wolf-cub! Do you know it is yourself who deserves death,\nnot for what you have just done, but for being the son of your father,\nand the nephew of your uncles? Ah! I am glad to hold a Mauprat in the\nhollow of my hand, and see whether a cur of a nobleman weighs as much as\na Christian.\"\n\nAs he spoke he lifted me from the ground as he would have lifted a hare.\n\n\"Little one,\" he said to my comrade, \"you can run home; you needn't\nbe afraid. Patience rarely gets angry with his equals; and he always\npardons his brothers, because his brothers are ignorant like himself,\nand know not what they do; but a Mauprat, look you, is a thing that\nknows how to read and write, and is only the viler for it all. Run\naway, then. But no; stay; I should like you once in your life to see\na nobleman receive a thrashing from the hand of a peasant. And that is\nwhat you are going to see; and I ask you not to forget it, little one,\nand to tell your parents about it.\"\n\nLivid, and gnashing my teeth with rage, I made desperate efforts to\nresist. Patience, with hideous calmness, bound me to a tree with an\nosier shoot. At the touch of his great horny hand I bent like a reed;\nand yet I was remarkably strong for my age. He fixed the owl to a branch\nabove my head, and the bird's blood, as it fell on me drop by drop,\ncaused me unspeakable horror; for though this was only the correction\nwe administer to sporting dogs that worry game, my brain, bewildered by\nrage, despair, and my comrades' cries, began to imagine some\nfrightful witchcraft. However, I really think I would rather have\nbeen metamorphosed into an owl at once than undergo the punishment he\ninflicted on me. In vain did I fling threats at him; in vain did I take\nterrible vows of vengeance; in vain did the peasant child throw himself\non his knees again and supplicate:\n\n\"Monsieur Patience, for God's sake, for your own sake, don't harm him;\nthe Mauprats will kill you.\"\n\nHe laughed, and shrugged his shoulders. Then, taking a handful of holly\ntwigs, he flogged me in a manner, I must own, more humiliating than\ncruel; for no sooner did he see a few drops of my blood appear, than he\nstopped and threw down the rod. I even noticed a sudden softening of his\nfeatures and voice, as if he were sorry for his severity.\n\n\"Mauprat,\" he said, crossing his arms on his breast and looking at me\nfixedly, \"you have now been punished; you have now been insulted,\nmy fine gentleman; that is enough for me. As you see, I might easily\nprevent you from ever harming me by stopping your breath with a touch of\nmy finger, and burying you under the stone at my door. Who would think\nof coming to Gaffer Patience to look for this fine child of noble blood?\nBut, as you may also see, I am not fond of vengeance; at the first\ncry of pain that escaped you, I stopped. No; I don't like to cause\nsuffering; I'm not a Mauprat. Still, it was well for you to learn by\nexperience what is to be a victim. May this disgust you of the hangman's\ntrade, which had been handed down from father to son in your family.\nGood-evening! You can go now; I no longer bear you malice; the justice\nof God is satisfied. You can tell your uncles to put me on their\ngridiron; they will have a tough morsel to eat; and they will swallow\nflesh that will come to life again in their gullets and choke them.\"\n\nThen he picked up the dead owl, and looking at it sadly:\n\n\"A peasant's child would not have done this,\" he said. \"This is sport\nfor gentle blood.\"\n\nAs he retired to his door he gave utterance to an exclamation which\nescaped him only on solemn occasions, and from which he derived his\ncurious surname:\n\n\"Patience, patience!\" he cried.\n\nThis, according to the gossips, was a cabalistic formula of his; and\nwhenever he had been heard to pronounce it, some misfortune had happened\nto the individual who had offended him. Sylvain crossed himself to ward\noff the evil spirit. The terrible words resounded through the tower into\nwhich Patience had just withdrawn, then the door closed behind him with\na bang.\n\nMy comrade was so eager to be off that he was within an ace of leaving\nme there bound to the tree. As soon as he had released me, he exclaimed:\n\n\"A sign of the cross! For God's sake, a sign of the cross! If you don't\ncross yourself you are bewitched; we shall be devoured by wolves as we\ngo, or else we shall meet the great monster.\"\n\n\"Idiot!\" I said; \"I have something else to think about. Listen; if you\nare ever unlucky enough to tell a single soul of what has happened, I\nwill strangle you.\"\n\n\"Alas! sir, what am I to do?\" he replied with a mixture of innocence and\nmalice. \"The sorcerer said I was to tell my parents.\"\n\nI raised my fist to strike him, but my strength failed. Choking with\nrage at the treatment I had just undergone, I fell down almost in a\nfaint, and Sylvain seized the opportunity for flight.\n\nWhen I came to I found myself alone. I did not know this part of\nVarenne; I had never been here before, and it was horribly wild. All\nthrough the day I had seen tracks of wolves and wild boars in the sand.\nAnd now night had come and I was still two leagues from Roche-Mauprat.\nThe gate would be shut, the drawbridge up; and I should get a bullet\nthrough me if I tried to enter after nine o'clock. As I did not know\nthe way, it was a hundred to one against my doing the two leagues in an\nhour. However, I would have preferred to die a thousand deaths rather\nthan ask shelter of the man in Gazeau Tower, even had he granted it\ngracefully. My pride was bleeding more than my flesh.\n\nI started off at a run, heedless of all risks. The path made a thousand\nturns; a thousand other paths kept crossing it. When I reached the plain\nI found myself in a pasture surrounded by hedges. There every trace of\nthe path disappeared. I jumped the hedge at a venture, and fell into a\nfield. The night was pitch-dark; even had it been day it would have been\nimpossible to ascertain my way in the midst of little properties buried\nbetween high banks bristling with thorns. Finally I reached a heath,\nthen some woods; and my fears, which had been somewhat subdued, now grew\nintense. Yes, I own I was a prey to mortal terrors. Trained to bravery,\nas a dog is to sport, I bore myself well enough before others. Spurred\nby vanity, indeed, I was foolishly bold when I had spectators; but left\nto myself, in the middle of the night, exhausted by toil and hunger,\nthough with no longing for food, unhinged by the emotions I had just\nexperienced, certain that my uncles would beat me when I returned, yet\nas anxious to return as if I were going to find paradise on earth at\nRoche-Mauprat, I wandered about until daybreak, suffering indescribable\nagonies. The howls of wolves, happily far off, more than once reached\nmy ears and froze the blood in my veins; and, as if my position had not\nbeen perilous enough in reality, my overwrought imagination must needs\nadd to it a thousand extravagant fantasies. Patience had the reputation\nof being a wolf-rearer. This, as you know, is a cabalistic speciality\naccredited in all countries. I kept on fancying, therefore, that I saw\nthis devilish little gray-beard, escorted by his ravening pack, and\nhimself in the form of a demi-wolf, pursing me through the woods.\nSeveral times when rabbits got up at my feet I almost fell backwards\nfrom the shock. And now, as I was certain that nobody could see, I made\nmany a sign of the cross; for, while affecting incredulity, I was, of\ncourse, at heart filled with all the superstitions born of fear.\n\nAt last, at daybreak, I reached Roche-Mauprat. I waited in a moat until\nthe gates were opened, and then slipped up to my room without being\nseen by anybody. As it was not altogether an unfailing tenderness that\nwatched over me at Roche-Mauprat, my absence had not been noticed during\nthe night. Meeting my Uncle John on the stairs, I led him to believe\nthat I had just got up; and, as the artifice proved successful, I went\noff to the hayloft and slept for the rest of the day.\n\n\n\n\nV\n\nAs I had nothing further to fear for myself, it would have been easy to\ntake vengeance on my enemy. Everything was favourable. The words he had\nuttered against my family would have been sufficient without any mention\nof the outrage done to my own person, which, in truth, I hardly cared to\nmake known. I had only to say a word, and in a quarter of an hour seven\nMauprats would have been in the saddle, delighted at the opportunity of\nmaking an example of a man who paid them no dues. Such a man would have\nseemed to them good for nothing but hanging as a warning to others.\n\nBut even if things had not been likely to reach this pitch, I somehow\nfelt an unconquerable aversion to asking eight men to avenge me on a\nsingle one. Just as I was about to ask them (for, in my anger, I had\nfirmly resolved to do so), I was held back by some instinct for fair\ndealing to which I had hitherto been a stranger, and whose presence in\nmyself I could hardly explain. Perhaps, too, the words of Patience had,\nunknown to myself, aroused in me a healthy sense of shame. Perhaps his\nrighteous maledictions on the nobles had given me glimpses of the idea\nof justice. Perhaps, in short, what I had hitherto despised in myself\nas impulses of weakness and compassion, henceforth began dimly to take a\nmore solemn and less contemptible shape.\n\nBe that as it may, I kept silent. I contented myself with thrashing\nSylvain as a punishment for having deserted me, and to impress upon him\nthat he was not to breathe a word about my unfortunate adventure. The\nbitterness of the recollection was intensified by an incident which\nhappened toward the end of autumn when I was out with him beating the\nwoods for game. The poor boy was genuinely attached to me; for, my\nbrutality notwithstanding, he always used to be at my heels the instant\nI was outside the castle. When any of his companions spoke ill of me, he\nwould take up my cause, and declare that I was merely somewhat hasty\nand not really bad at heart. Ah, it is the gentle, resigned souls of the\nhumble that keep up the pride and roughness of the great. Well, we were\ntrying to trap larks when my sabot-shot page, who always hunted about\nahead of me, came back, saying in his rude dialect:\n\n\"I can see the wolf-driver with the mole-catcher.\"\n\nThis announcement sent a shudder through all my limbs. However, the\nlonging for revenge produced a reaction, and I marched straight on\nto meet the sorcerer. Perhaps, too, I felt somewhat reassured by the\npresence of his companion, who was a frequenter of Roche-Mauprat, and\nwould be likely to show me respect and afford me assistance.\n\nMarcasse, the mole-catcher, as he was called, professed to rid the\ndwellings and fields of the district of polecats, weasels, rats and\nother vermin. Nor did he confine his good offices to Berry; every year\nhe went the round of La Marche, Nivernais, Limousin, and Saintonge,\nvisiting, alone and on foot, all the places that had the good sense to\nappreciate his talents. He was well received everywhere, in the castle\nno less than in the cottage; for his was a trade that had been carried\non successfully and honestly in his family for generations (indeed, his\ndescendants still carry it on). Thus he had work and a home awaiting him\nfor every day in the year. As regular in his round as the earth in her\nrotation, he would reappear on a given day at the very place where he\nhad appeared the year before, and always with the same dog and with the\nsame long sword.\n\nThis personage was as curious as the sorcerer Patience; perhaps more\ncomic in his way than the sorcerer. He was a bilious, melancholy man,\ntall, lean, angular, full of languor, dignity, and deliberation in\nspeech and action. So little did he like talking that he answered all\nquestions in monosyllables; and yet he never failed to obey the laws of\nthe most scrupulous politeness, and rarely said a word without raising\nhis hand to the corner of his hat as a sign of respect and civility.\nWas he thus by nature, or, in his itinerant trade, had this wise\nreserve arisen from a fear of alienating some of his numerous clients\nby incautious chatter? No one knew. In all houses he was allowed a free\nhand; during the day he had the key of every granary; in the evening,\na place at the fireside of every kitchen. He knew everything that\nhappened; for his dreamy, absorbed air led people to talk freely in his\npresence; yet he had never been known to inform any household of the\ndoings of another.\n\nIf you wish to know how I had become struck by this strange character,\nI may tell you that I had been a witness of my uncle's and grandfather's\nefforts to make him talk. They hoped to draw from him some information\nabout the chateau of Saint-Severe, the home of a man they hated and\nenvied, M. Hubert de Mauprat. Although Don Marcasse (they called him Don\nbecause he seemed to have the bearing and pride of a ruined hidalgo),\nalthough Don Marcasse, I say, had shown himself as incompressible here\nas elsewhere, the Coupe-Jarret Mauprats never failed to squeeze him a\nlittle more in the hope of extracting some details about the Casse-Tete\nMauprats.\n\nNobody, then, could discover Marcasse's opinions about anything; it\nwould have been simplest to suppose that he did not take the trouble\nto have any. Yet the attraction which Patience seemed to feel towards\nhim--so great that he would accompany him on his travels for several\nweeks altogether--led one to believe that there was some witchery in the\nman's mysterious air, and that it was not solely the length of his sword\nand the skill of his dog which played such wonderful havoc with the\nmoles and weasels. There were whispered rumours of the enchanted herbs\nthat he employed to lure these suspicious animals from their holes into\nhis nets. However, as people found themselves better off for his magic,\nno one dreamt of denouncing it as criminal.\n\nI do not know if you have ever seen one of the rat-hunts. It is a\ncurious sight, especially in a fodder-loft. The man and dog climbing up\nladders and running along beams with marvellous assurance and agility,\nthe dog sniffing every hole in the wall, playing the cat, crouching down\nand lying in wait until the game comes out for his master's rapier;\nthe man thrusting through bundles of straw and putting the enemy to the\nsword--all this, when arranged and carried out with gravity and dignity\nby Don Marcasse, was, I assure you, a most singular and interesting\nperformance.\n\nWhen I saw this trusty fellow I felt equal to braving the sorcerer, and\nadvanced boldly. Sylvain stared at me in admiration, and I noticed that\nPatience himself was not prepared for such audacity. I pretended to go\nup to Marcasse and speak to him, as though quite unconcerned about\nthe presence of my enemy. Seeing this he gently thrust aside the\nmole-catcher, and, laying his heavy hand on my head, said very quietly:\n\n\"You have grown of late, my fine gentleman!\"\n\nThe blood rushed to my face, and, drawing back scornfully, I answered:\n\n\"Take care what you are doing, clodhopper; you should remember that if\nyou still have your two ears, it is to my kindness that you owe them.\"\n\n\"My two ears!\" said Patience, with a bitter laugh.\n\nThen making an allusion to the nickname of my family, he added:\n\n\"Perhaps you mean my two hamstrings? Patience, patience! The time,\nmaybe, is not far distant when clodhoppers will rid the nobles of\nneither ears nor hamstrings, but of their heads and their purses.\"\n\n\"Silence, Master Patience!\" said the mole-catcher solemnly; \"these are\nnot the words of a philosopher.\"\n\n\"You are quite right, quite right,\" replied the sorcerer; \"and in truth,\nI don't know why I allow myself to argue with this lad. He might have\nhad me made into pap by his uncles. I whipped him in the summer for\nplaying me a stupid trick; and I don't know what happened to the family,\nbut the Mauprats lost a fine chance of injuring a neighbour.\"\n\n\"Learn, peasant,\" I said, \"that a nobleman always takes vengeance nobly.\nI did not want my wrongs avenged by people more powerful than yourself;\nbut wait a couple of years; I promise I will hang you with my own hand\non a certain tree that I shall easily recognise, not very far from the\ndoor of Gazeau Tower. If I don't I will renounce my birthright; if I\nspare you I will take the title of wolf-driver.\"\n\nPatience smiled; then, suddenly becoming serious, he fixed on me that\nsearching look which rendered his physiognomy so striking. Then turning\nto the weasel-hunter:\n\n\"It is strange,\" he said; \"there must be something in blood. Take the\nvilest noble, and you will find that in certain things he has more\nspirit than the bravest of us. Ah! it is simple enough,\" he added,\nspeaking to himself; \"they are brought up like that, whilst we--we, they\ntell us, are born to obey. Patience!\"\n\nHe was silent for an instant; then, rousing himself from his reverie, he\nsaid to me in a kindly though somewhat mocking tone:\n\n\"And so you want to hang me, Monseigneur Straw-Stalk? You will have to\neat a lot of beef, then, for you are not yet tall enough to reach the\nbranch which is to bear me; and before then . . . perhaps many things\nwill happen that are not dreamt of in your little philosophy.\"\n\n\"Nonsense! Why talk nonsense?\" said the mole-catcher, with a serious\nair; \"come, make peace. Monseigneur Bernard, I ask pardon for Patience;\nhe is an old man, a fool.\"\n\n\"No, no,\" said Patience; \"I want him to hang me; he is right; this is\nmerely my due; and, in fact, it may come more quickly than all the rest.\nYou must not make too much haste to grow, monsieur; for I--well, I am\nmaking more haste to grow old than I would wish; and you who are so\nbrave, you would not attack a man no longer able to defend himself.\"\n\n\"You didn't hesitate to use your strength against me!\" I cried.\n\"Confess, now; didn't you treat me brutally? Wasn't it a coward's work,\nthat?\"\n\n\"Oh, children, children!\" he said. \"See how the thing reasons! Out of\nthe mouths of children cometh truth.\"\n\nAnd he moved away dreamily, and muttering to himself as was his wont.\nMarcasse took off his hat to me and said in an impassive tone:\n\n\"He is wrong . . . live at peace . . . pardon . . . peace . . .\nfarewell!\"\n\nThey disappeared; and there ended my relations with Patience. I did not\ncome in contact with him again until long afterward.\n\n\n\n\nVI\n\nI was fifteen when my grandfather died. At Roche-Mauprat his death\ncaused no sorrow, but infinite consternation. He was the soul of every\nvice that reigned therein, and it is certain that he was more cruel,\nthough less vile, than his sons. On his death the sort of glory which\nhis audacity had won for us grew dim. His sons, hitherto held under firm\ncontrol, became more and more drunken and debauched. Moreover, each day\nadded some new peril to their expeditions.\n\nExcept for the few trusty vassals whom we treated well, and who were all\ndevoted to us, we were becoming more and more isolated and resourceless.\nPeople had left the neighbouring country in consequence of our violent\ndepredations. The terror that we inspired pushed back daily the bounds\nof the desert around us. In making our ventures we had to go farther\nafield, even to the borders of the plain. There we had not the upper\nhand; and my Uncle Laurence, the boldest of us all, was dangerously\nwounded in a skirmish. Other schemes had to be devised. John suggested\nthem. One was that we should slip into the fairs under various\ndisguises, and exercise our skill in thieving. From brigands we became\npick-pockets, and our detested name sank lower and lower in infamy.\nWe formed a fellowship with the most noisome characters our province\nconcealed, and, by an exchange of rascally services, once again managed\nto avoid destitution.\n\nI say we, for I was beginning to take a place in this band of cutthroats\nwhen my grandfather died. He had yielded to my entreaties and allowed\nme to join in some of the last expeditions he attempted. I shall make\nno apologies; but here, gentlemen, you behold a man who has followed the\nprofession of a bandit. I feel no remorse at the recollection, no more\nthan a soldier would feel at having served a campaign under orders from\nhis general. I thought that I was still living in the middle ages. The\nlaws of the land, with all their strength and wisdom, were to me words\ndevoid of meaning. I felt brave and full of vigour; fighting was a joy.\nTruly, the results of our victories often made me blush; but, as they in\nno way profited myself, I washed my hands of them. Nay, I remember with\npleasure that I helped more than one victim who had been knocked down to\nget up and escape.\n\nThis existence, with its movement, its dangers, and its fatigues, had a\nnumbing effect on me. It took me away from any painful reflections which\nmight have arisen in my mind. Besides, it freed me from the immediate\ntyranny of John. However, after the death of my grandfather, when our\nband degraded itself to exploits of a different nature, I fell back\nunder his odious sway. I was by no means fitted for lying and fraud. I\ndisplayed not only aversion but also incapacity for this new industry.\nConsequently my uncle looked upon me as useless, and began to maltreat\nme again. They would have driven me away had they not been afraid that\nI might make my peace with society, and become a dangerous enemy to\nthemselves. While they were in doubt as to whether it was wiser to\nfeed me or to live in fear of me, they often thought (as I have since\nlearned) of picking a quarrel with me, and forcing a fight in which I\nmight be got rid of. This was John's suggestion. Antony, however, who\nretained more of Tristan's energy and love of fair play at home than any\nof his brothers, proved clearly that I did more good than harm. I was,\nhe declared, a brave fighter, and there was no knowing when they might\nneed an extra hand. I might also be shaped into a swindler. I was very\nyoung and very ignorant; but John, perhaps, would endeavour to win me\nover by kindness, and make my lot less wretched. Above all, he might\nenlighten me as to my true position, by explaining that I was an\noutcast from society, and could not return to it without being hanged\nimmediately. Then, perhaps, my obstinacy and pride would give way, out\nof regard to my own well-being on the one hand, and from necessity on\nthe other. At all events, they should try this before getting rid of me.\n\n\"For,\" said Antony to round off his homily, \"we were ten Mauprats last\nyear; our father is dead, and, if we kill Bernard, we shall only be\neight.\"\n\nThis argument gained the day. They brought me forth from the species of\ndungeon in which I had languished for several months; they gave me new\nclothes; they exchanged my old gun for a beautiful carbine that I had\nalways coveted; they explained to me my position in the world; they\nhonoured me with the best wine at meals. I promised to reflect, and\nmeanwhile, became rather more brutalized by inaction and drunkenness\nthan I had been by brigandage.\n\nHowever, my captivity had made such a terrible impression on me that\nI took a secret oath to dare any dangers that might assail me on the\nterritories of the King of France, rather than endure a repetition of\nthat hideous experience. Nothing but a miserable point of honour now\nkept me at Roche-Mauprat. It was evident that a storm was gathering over\nour heads. The peasants were discontented, in spite of all our\nefforts to attach them to us; doctrines of independence were secretly\ninsinuating themselves into their midst; our most faithful retainers\nwere growing tired of merely having their fill of bread and meat; they\nwere demanding money, and we had none. We had received more than one\nserious summons to pay our fiscal dues to the state, and as our private\ncreditors had joined hands with the crown officers and the recalcitrant\npeasants, everything was threatening us with a catastrophe like that\nwhich had just overtaken the Seigneur de Pleumartin in our province.(*)\n\n     (*) The reputation which the Seigneur de Pleumartin has left\n     behind him in the province will preserve the story of\n     Mauprat from the reproach of exaggeration. Pen would refuse\n     to trace the savage obscenities and refinements of cruelty\n     which marked the life of this madman, and which perpetuated\n     the traditions of feudal brigandage in Berry down to the\n     last days of the ancient monarchy. His chateau was besieged,\n     and after a stubborn resistance he was taken and hanged.\n     There are many people still living, nor yet very advanced in\n     years, who knew the man.\n\nMy uncles had long thought of making common cause with this country\nsquire in his marauding expeditions and his resistance to authority.\nHowever, just as Pleumartin, about to fall into the hands of his\nenemies, had given his word of honour that he would welcome us as\nfriends and allies if we went to his assistance, we had heard of his\ndefeat and tragic end. Thus we ourselves were now on our guard night\nand day. It was a question of either fleeing the country or bracing\nourselves for a decisive struggle. Some counselled the former\nalternative; the others declared their resolve to follow the advice of\ntheir dying father and to find a grave under the ruins of the keep.\nAny suggestion of flight or compromise they denounced as contemptible\ncowardice. The fear, then, of incurring such a reproach, and perhaps in\nsome measure an instinctive love of danger, still kept me back. However,\nmy aversion to this odious existence was only lying dormant, ready to\nbreak out violently at any moment.\n\nOne evening, after a heavy supper, we remained at table, drinking\nand conversing--God knows in what words and on what subject! It was\nfrightful weather. The rain, driven through the broken windows, was\nrunning in streams across the stone floor of the hall; and the old walls\nwere trembling in the storm. The night wind was whistling through chinks\nin the roof and making the flames of our resin torches flicker weirdly.\nDuring the meal my uncles had rallied me very much on what they called\nmy virtue; they had treated my shyness in the presence of women as a\nsign of continence; and it was especially in this matter that they urged\nme to evil by ridiculing my modesty. While parrying these coarse gibes\nand making thrusts in the same strain, I had been drinking enormously.\nConsequently, my wild imagination had become inflamed, and I boasted\nthat I would be bolder and more successful with the first woman brought\nto Roche-Mauprat than any of my uncles. The challenge was accepted amid\nroars of laughter. Peals of thunder sent back an answer to the infernal\nmerriment.\n\nAll at once the horn was heard at the portcullis. Everybody stopped\ntalking. The blast just blown was the signal used by the Mauprats to\nsummon each other or make themselves known. It was my Uncle Laurence,\nwho had been absent all day and who was now asking to be let in. We had\nso little confidence in others that we acted as our own turnkeys in the\nfortress. John rose and took down the keys, but he stopped immediately\non hearing a second blast of the horn. This meant that Laurence was\nbringing in a prize, and that we were to go and meet him. In the\ntwinkling of an eye all the Mauprats were at the portcullis, torch in\nhand--except myself, whose indifference at this moment was profound, and\nwhose legs were seriously conscious of wine.\n\n\"If it is a woman,\" cried Antony as he went out, \"I swear by the soul of\nmy father that she shall be handed over to you, my valiant young man,\nand we'll see if your courage comes up to your conceit.\"\n\nI remained with my elbows on the table, sunk in an uncomfortable stupor.\n\nWhen the door opened again I saw a woman in a strange costume entering\nwith a confident step. It required an effort to keep my mind from\nwandering, and to grasp what one of the Mauprats came and whispered to\nme. In the middle of a wolf-hunt, at which several of the nobles in the\nneighbourhood had been present with their wives, this young lady's horse\nhad taken fright and bolted away from the rest of the field. When it had\npulled up after a gallop of about a league, she had tried to find her\nway back; but, not knowing the Varenne district, where all the landmarks\nare so much alike, she had gone farther and farther astray. The\nstorm and the advent of night had completed her perplexity. Laurence,\nhappening to meet her, had offered to escort her to the chateau of\nRochemaure, which, as a fact, was more than six leagues distant; but\nhe had declared that it was quite near, and had pretended to be the\ngamekeeper there. She did not actually know the lady of Rochemaure, but\nbeing a distant connection of hers, she counted upon a welcome. Never\nhaving seen the face of a single Mauprat, and little dreaming that she\nwas so near their haunt, she had followed her guide confidingly; and as\nshe had never in her life caught a glimpse of Roche-Mauprat, whether in\nthe distance or close at hand, she was led upon the scene of our orgies\nwithout having the least suspicion of the trap into which she had\nfallen.\n\nWhen I rubbed my heavy eyes and beheld this woman, so young and so\nbeautiful, with her expression of calm sincerity and of goodness, the\nlike of which I had never seen on the brow of any other (for all\nthose who had passed the portcullis of our abode were either insolent\nprostitutes or stupid victims), I could not but think I was dreaming.\n\nRemembering how prominently fairies figured in my legends of chivalry,\nI almost fancied that Morgana or Urganda had come among us to administer\njustice; and, for the moment, I felt an inclination to throw myself on\nmy knees and protest against any judgment which should confound me\nwith my uncles. Antony, to whom Laurence had quickly given the cue,\napproached her with as much politeness as he had in his composition, and\nbegged her to excuse his hunting costume, likewise that of his friends.\nThey were all nephews or cousins of the lady of Rochemaure, whom they\nwere now awaiting before sitting down to table. Being very religious,\nshe was at present in the chapel, in pious conference with the chaplain.\nThe air of simple confidence with which the stranger listened to these\nabsurd lies went to my heart, but I had not a very clear idea of what I\nfelt.\n\n\"Please,\" she said to my Uncle John, who was dancing attendance on her\nwith the leer of a satyr, \"please do not let me disturb this lady. I am\nso troubled about the anxiety I must be causing my father and my friends\nat the present moment, that I could not really stop here. All I ask is\nthat she will be kind enough to lend me a fresh horse and a guide, so\nthat I may return to the place where I presume my people may have gone\nto wait for me.\"\n\n\"Madame,\" replied John, with assurance, \"it is impossible for you to\nstart again in such weather as this; besides, if you did, that would\nonly serve to delay the hour of rejoining those who are looking for you.\nTen of our men, well mounted and provided with torches, shall set out\nthis very moment in ten different directions and scour every corner of\nVarenne. Thus, in two hours at the most, your relatives will be certain\nto have news of you, and you will soon see them arriving here, where we\nwill entertain them as best we can. Please, then, set your mind at rest,\nand take some cordial to restore you; for you must be wet through and\nquite exhausted.\"\n\n\"Were it not for the anxiety I feel,\" she answered with a smile,\n\"I should be famished. I will try to eat something; but do not put\nyourselves to any inconvenience on my account. You have been far too\ngood already.\"\n\nApproaching the table, where I was still resting on my elbows, she took\nsome fruit that was by my side without noticing me. I turned and stared\nat her insolently with a besotted expression. She returned my gaze\nhaughtily--at least, so it appeared to me then. I have since learned\nthat she did not even see me; for, while making a great effort to\nappear calm and to reply with an air of confidence to the offers of\nhospitality, she was at heart very much disturbed by the unexpected\npresence of so many strange men with their forbidding mien and rough\ngarb. However, she did not suspect anything. I overheard one of the\nMauprats near me saying to John:\n\n\"Good! It's all right; she is falling into the trap. Let us make her\ndrink; then she will begin to talk.\"\n\n\"One moment,\" replied John; \"watch her carefully; this is a serious\nmatter; there is something better to be had out of this than a little\npassing pleasure. I am going to talk it over with the others; you will\nbe sent for to give your opinion. Meanwhile keep an eye on Bernard.\"\n\n\"What is the matter?\" I said abruptly, as I faced him. \"Does not\nthis girl belong to me? Did not Antony swear it by the soul of my\ngrandfather?\"\n\n\"Yes, confound it, that's true,\" said Antony, approaching our group,\nwhilst the other Mauprats surrounded the lady. \"Listen, Bernard; I will\nkeep my word on one condition.\"\n\n\"What is that?\"\n\n\"It is quite simple: that you won't within the next ten minutes tell\nthis wench that she is not at old Rochemaure's.\"\n\n\"What do you take me for?\" I answered, pulling my hat over my eyes. \"Do\nyou think that I am an idiot? Wait a minute; would you like me to go\nand get my grandmother's dress which is upstairs and pass myself off for\nthis same lady of Rochemaure?\"\n\n\"A splendid idea!\" replied Laurence.\n\n\"But before anything is done,\" said John, \"I want to speak to you all.\"\n\nAnd making signs to the others, he drew them out of the hall. Just as\nthey were going out I thought I noticed that John was trying to persuade\nAntony to keep watch over me. But Antony, with a firmness which I could\nnot understand, insisted on following the rest. I was left alone with\nthe stranger.\n\nFor a moment I remained bewildered, almost stupefied, and more\nembarrassed than pleased at the _tete-a-tete_. Then I endeavoured to\nthink of some explanation of these mysterious things that were happening\naround me, and succeeded, as far as the fumes of the wine would allow\nme, in imagining something fairly probable, though, indeed, remote\nenough from the actual truth.\n\nI thought I could account for everything I had just seen and heard by\nsupposing, first, that the lady, quiet and richly dressed though she\nwas, was one of those daughters of Bohemia that I had sometimes seen\nat fairs; secondly, that Laurence, having met her in the country, had\nbrought her here to amuse the company; and, thirdly, that they had told\nher of my condition of swaggering drunkenness, and had prevailed on her\nto put my gallantry to the proof, whilst they were to watch me through\nthe keyhole. My first movement, as soon as these ideas had taken\npossession of me, was to rise and go straight to the door. This I locked\nwith a double turn and then bolted. When I had done this I returned to\nthe lady, determined that I would not, at all events, give her cause to\nlaugh at my bashfulness.\n\nShe was sitting close to the fire, and as she was occupied in drying\nher wet garments, leaning forward over the hearth, she had not taken\nany notice of what I was doing; but when I approached her the strange\nexpression on my face caused her to start. I had made up my mind to kiss\nher, as a beginning; but, I know not by what miracle, as soon as she\nraised her eyes to mine, this familiarity became impossible. I only had\nsufficient courage to say:\n\n\"Upon my word, mademoiselle, you are a charming creature, and I love\nyou--as true as my name is Bernard Mauprat.\"\n\n\"Bernard Mauprat!\" she cried, springing up; \"you are Bernard Mauprat,\nyou? In that case, change your manner and learn to whom you are talking.\nHave they not told you?\"\n\n\"No one has told me, but I can guess,\" I replied with a grin, while\ntrying hard to trample down the feeling of respect with which her sudden\npallor and imperious attitude inspired me.\n\n\"If you can guess,\" she said, \"how is it possible that you allow\nyourself to speak to me in this way? But they were right when they said\nyou were ill-mannered; and yet I always had a wish to meet you.\"\n\n\"Really!\" I said, with the same hideous grin. \"You! A princess of the\nking's highway, who have known so many men in your life? But let my\nlips meet your own, my sweet, and you shall see if I am not as nicely\nmannered as those uncles of mine whom you were listening to so willingly\njust now.\"\n\n\"Your uncles!\" she cried, suddenly seizing her chair and placing it\nbetween us as if from some instinct of self-defence. \"Oh, mon Dieu! mon\nDieu! Then I am not at Madame de Rochemaure's?\"\n\n\"Our name certainly begins in the same way, and we come of as good a\nrock as anybody.\"\n\n\"Roche-Mauprat!\" she muttered, trembling from head to foot, like a hind\nwhen it hears the howl of wolves.\n\nAnd her lips grew quite white. Her agony was manifest in every gesture.\nFrom an involuntary feeling of sympathy I shuddered myself, and I was on\nthe point of changing my manner and language forthwith.\n\n\"What can there be in this to astound her so?\" I asked myself. \"Is she\nnot merely acting a part? And even if the Mauprats are not hidden behind\nsome wainscot listening to us, is she not sure to give them an account\nof everything that takes place? And yet she is trembling like an aspen\nleaf. But what if she is acting? I once saw an actress play Genevieve de\nBrabant, and she wept so that one might have been deceived.\"\n\nI was in a state of great perplexity, and I cast harassed glances now at\nher, now at the doors, which I fancied every moment would be thrown wide\nopen amid roars of laughter from my uncles.\n\nThis woman was beautiful as the day. I do not believe there has ever\nlived a woman as lovely as she. It is not I alone who say so; she has\nleft a reputation for beauty which has not yet died out in her province.\nShe was rather tall, slender, and remarkable for the easy grace of her\nmovements. Her complexion was very fair, while her eyes were dark and\nher hair like ebony. Her glance and her smile showed a union of goodness\nand acuteness which it was almost impossible to conceive; it was as\nif Heaven had given her two souls, one wholly of intellect, the other\nwholly of feeling. She was naturally cheerful and brave--an angel,\nindeed, whom the sorrows of humanity had not yet dared to touch. She\nknew not what it was to suffer; she knew not what it was to distrust\nand dread. This, indeed, was the first trial of her life, and it was I,\nbrute that I was, who made her undergo it. I took her for a gipsy, and\nshe was an angel of purity.\n\nShe was my young cousin (or aunt, after the Breton fashion), Edmee de\nMauprat, the daughter of M. Hubert, my great-uncle (again in the Breton\nfashion), known as the Chevalier--he who had sought release from the\nOrder of Malta that he might marry, though already somewhat advanced\nin years. My cousin was the same age as myself; at least, there was\na difference of only a few months between us. Both of us were now\nseventeen, and this was our first interview. She whom I ought to have\nprotected at the peril of my life against the world was now standing\nbefore me trembling and terror-stricken, like a victim before the\nexecutioner.\n\nShe made a great effort, and approaching me as I walked about the hall\ndeep in thought, she explained who she was, adding:\n\n\"It is impossible that you can be an infamous creature like all these\nbrigands whom I have just seen, and of whose hideous life I have often\nheard. You are young; your mother was good and wise. My father wanted to\nadopt you and bring you up as his son. Even to-day he is still full of\ngrief at not being able to draw you out of the abyss in which you lie.\nHave you not often received messages from him? Bernard, you and I are of\nthe same family; think of the ties of blood; why would you insult me? Do\nthey intend to assassinate me here or torture me? Why did they deceive\nme by saying that I was at Rochemaure? Why did they withdraw in this\nmysterious way? What are they preparing? What is going to happen?\"\n\nHer words were cut short by the report of a gun outside. A shot from the\nculverin replied to it, and the alarm trumpet shook the gloomy walls of\nthe keep with its dismal note. Mademoiselle de Mauprat fell back into\nher chair. I remained where I was, wondering whether this was some\nnew scene in the comedy they were enjoying at my expense. However,\nI resolved not to let the alarm cause me any uneasiness until I had\ncertain proof that it was not a trick.\n\n\"Come, now,\" I said, going up to her again, \"own that all this is a\njoke. You are not Mademoiselle de Mauprat at all; and you merely want to\ndiscover if I am an apprentice capable of making love.\"\n\n\"I swear by Christ,\" she answered, taking my hands in her own, which\nwere cold as death, \"that I am Edmee, your cousin, your prisoner--yes,\nand your friend; for I have always felt an interest in you; I have\nalways implored my father not to cease his efforts for you. But listen,\nBernard; they are fighting, and fighting with guns! It must be my father\nwho has come to look for me, and they are going to kill him. Ah!\" she\ncried, falling on her knees before me, \"go and prevent that, Bernard!\nTell your uncles to respect my father, the best of men, if you but knew!\nTell them that, if they hate our family, if they must have blood, they\nmay kill me! Let them tear my heart out; but let them respect my father\n. . .\"\n\nSome one outside called me in a violent voice.\n\n\"Where is the coward? Where is that wretched boy?\" shouted my Uncle\nLaurence.\n\nThen he shook the door; but I had fastened it so securely that it\nresisted all his furious blows.\n\n\"That miserable cur is amusing himself by making love while our throats\nare being cut! Bernard, the mounted police are attacking us! Your Uncle\nLouis had just been killed! Come and help us! For God's sake, come,\nBernard!\"\n\n\"May the devil take the lot of you,\" I cried, \"and may you be killed\nyourself, if I believe a single word of all this. I am not such a fool\nas you imagine; the only cowards here are those who lie. Didn't I swear\nthat the woman should be mine? I'm not going to give her up until I\nchoose.\"\n\n\"To hell with you!\" replied Laurence; \"you are pretending . . .\"\n\nThe shots rang out faster. Frightful cries were heard. Laurence left the\ndoor and ran in the direction of the noise. His eagerness proved him\nso much in earnest that I could no longer refuse to believe him. The\nthought that they would accuse me of cowardice overcame me. I advanced\ntowards the door.\n\n\"O Bernard! O Monsieur de Mauprat!\" cried Edmee, staggering after me;\n\"let me go with you. I will throw myself at your uncles' feet; I will\nmake them stop the fight; I will give them all I possess, my life, if\nthey wish . . . if only they will spare my father.\"\n\n\"Wait a moment,\" I said, turning towards her; \"I am by no means certain\nthat this is not a joke at my expense. I have a suspicion that my uncles\nare there, behind that door, and that, while our whippers-in are firing\noff guns in the courtyard, they are waiting with a blanket to toss me.\nNow, either you are my cousin, or you are a . . . You must make me a\nsolemn promise, and I will make you one in return. If you are one of\nthese wandering charmers and I quit this room the dupe of your pretty\nacting, you must swear to be my mistress, and to allow none other near\nyou until I have had my rights; otherwise, for my part, I swear that\nyou shall be chastised, even as my spotted dog Flora was chastised this\nmorning. If, on the other hand, you are Edmee, and I swear to intervene\nbetween your father and those who would kill him, what promise will you\nmake me, what will you swear?\"\n\n\"If you save my father,\" she cried, \"I swear to you that I will marry\nyou, I swear it.\"\n\n\"Ho! ho! indeed!\" I said, emboldened by her enthusiasm, the sublimity of\nwhich I did not understand. \"Give me a pledge, then, so that in any case\nI do not go out from here like a fool.\"\n\nI took her in my arms and kissed her. She did not attempt to resist. Her\ncheeks were like ice. Mechanically she began to follow me as I moved to\nthe door. I was obliged to push her back. I did so without roughness;\nbut she fell as one in a faint. I began to grasp the gravity of my\nposition; for there was nobody in the corridor and the tumult outside\nwas becoming more and more alarming. I was about to run and get my\nweapons, when a last feeling of distrust, or it may have been another\nsentiment, prompted me to go back and double-lock the door of the hall\nwhere I was leaving Edmee. I put the key into my belt and hastened to\nthe ramparts, armed with a gun, which I loaded as I ran.\n\nIt was simply an attack made by the mounted police, and had nothing\nwhatever to do with Mademoiselle de Mauprat. A little while before our\ncreditors had obtained a writ of arrest against us. The law officers,\nbeaten and otherwise severely handled, had demanded of the King's\nadvocate at the provincial court of Bourges another warrant of arrest.\nThis the armed police were now doing their best to execute. They had\nhoped to effect an easy capture by means of a night surprise. But we\nwere in a better state of defence than they had anticipated. Our men\nwere brave and well armed; and then we were fighting for our very\nexistence; we had the courage of despair, and this was an immense\nadvantage. Our band amounted to twenty-four all told; theirs to more\nthan fifty soldiers, in addition to a score or more of peasants, who\nwere slinging stones from the flanks. These, however, did more harm to\ntheir allies than they did to us.\n\nFor half an hour the fighting was most desperate. At the end of this\ntime the enemy had become so dismayed by our resistance that they fell\nback, and hostilities were suspended. However, they soon returned to the\nattack, and again were repulsed with loss. Hostilities were once more\nsuspended. They then, for the third time, called upon us to surrender,\npromising that our lives should be spared. Antony Mauprat replied with\nan obscene jest. They remained undecided, but did not withdraw.\n\nI had fought bravely; I had done what I called my duty. There was a long\nlull. It was impossible to judge the distance of the enemy, and we\ndared not fire at random into the darkness, for our ammunition was too\nprecious. All my uncles remained riveted on the ramparts, in case of\nfresh attack. My Uncle Louis was dangerously wounded. Thoughts of my\nprisoner returned to my mind. At the beginning of the fight I had heard\nJohn Mauprat saying, that if our defeat seemed imminent, we must offer\nto hand her over to the enemy, on condition that they should raise the\nseige; that if they refused, we must hang her before their eyes. I\nhad no longer any doubts about the truth of what she had told me.\nWhen victory appeared to declare for us they forgot the captive. But I\nnoticed the crafty John quitting the culverin which he so loved to\nfire, and creeping away like a cat into the darkness. A feeling of\nungovernable jealousy seized me. I threw down my gun and dashed after\nhim, knife in hand, resolved, I believe, to stab him if he attempted to\ntouch what I considered my booty. I saw him approach the door, try to\nopen it, peer attentively through the keyhole, to assure himself that\nhis prey had not escaped him. Suddenly shots were heard again. He sprang\nto his maimed feet with that marvellous agility of his, and limped off\nto the ramparts. For myself, hidden as I was by the darkness, I let him\npass and did not follow. A passion other than the love of slaughter had\njust taken possession of me. A flash of jealousy had fired my senses.\nThe smell of powder, the sight of blood, the noise, the danger, and the\nmany bumpers of brandy we had passed round to keep up our strength had\nstrangely heated my brain. I took the key from my belt and opened the\ndoor noisily. And now, as I stood before my captive again, I was no\nlonger the suspicious and clumsy novice she had so easily moved to pity:\nI was the wild outlaw of Roche-Mauprat, a hundred times more dangerous\nthan at first. She rushed towards me eagerly. I opened my arms to\ncatch her; instead of being frightened she threw herself into them,\nexclaiming:\n\n\"Well! and my father?\"\n\n\"Your father,\" I said, kissing her, \"is not there. At the present moment\nthere is no question either of him or of you. We have brought down a\ndozen gendarmes, that is all. Victory, as usual, is declaring for us.\nSo, don't trouble yourself any more about your father; and I, I won't\ntrouble myself further about the King's men. Let us live in peace and\nrejoice in love.\"\n\nWith these words I raised to my lips a goblet of wine which had been\nleft on the table. But she took it out of my hands with an air of\nauthority that made me all the bolder.\n\n\"Don't drink any more,\" she said; \"think seriously of what you are\nsaying. Is what you tell me true? Will you answer for it on your honour,\non the soul of your mother?\"\n\n\"Every word is true; I swear it by your pretty rosy lips,\" I replied,\ntrying to kiss her again.\n\nBut she drew back in terror.\n\n\"Oh, mon Dieu!\" she exclaimed, \"he is drunk! Bernard! Bernard! remember\nwhat you promised; do not break your word. You have not forgotten, have\nyou, that I am your kinswoman, your sister?\"\n\n\"You are my mistress or my wife,\" I answered, still pursuing her.\n\n\"You are a contemptible creature!\" she rejoined, repulsing me with her\nriding whip. \"What have you done that I should be aught to you? Have you\nhelped my father?\"\n\n\"I swore to help him; and I would have helped him if he had been there;\nit is just the same, therefore, as if I really had. But, had he been\nthere, and had I tried to save him and failed, do you know that for\nthis treachery Roche-Mauprat could not have provided any instrument of\ntorture cruel enough and slow enough to drag the life out of me inch by\ninch? For all I know, they may actually have heard my vow; I proclaimed\nit loudly enough. But what do I care? I set little store by a couple of\ndays more or less of life. But I do set some store by your favour, my\nbeauty. I don't want to be the languishing knight that every one laughs\nat. Come, now, love me at once; or, my word, I will return to the fight,\nand if I am killed, so much the worse for you. You will no longer have\na knight to help you, and you will still have seven Mauprats to keep at\nbay. I'm afraid you are not strong enough for that rough work, my pretty\nlittle love-bird.\"\n\nThese words, which I threw out at random, merely to distract her\nattention so that I might seize her hands or her waist, made a deep\nimpression on her. She fled to the other end of the hall, and tried\nto force open the window; but her little hands could not even move the\nheavy leaden sash in the rusty ironwork. Her efforts made me laugh. She\nclasped her hands in terror, and remained motionless. Then all at once\nthe expression of her face changed. She seemed to have resolved how to\nact, and came toward me smiling and with outstretched hand. So beautiful\nwas she thus that a mist came over my eyes and for a moment I saw her\nnot.\n\nAh, gentlemen, forgive my childishness. I must tell you how she was\ndressed. After that weird night she never wore that costume again, and\nyet I can remember it so exactly. It is a long, long time ago. But were\nI to live as long as I have already lived again, I should not forget\na single detail, so much was I struck by it amid the tumult that\nwas raging within me and without; amid the din of shots striking\nthe ramparts, the lightning flashes ripping the sky, and the violent\npalpitations which sent my blood surging from my heart to my brain, and\nfrom my head to my breast.\n\nOh, how lovely she was! It seems as if her shade were even now\npassing before my eyes. Yes; I fancy I see her in the same dress, the\nriding-habit which used to be worn in those days. The skirt of it was of\ncloth and very full; round the waist was a red sash, while a waistcoat\nof pearl-gray satin, fastened with buttons, fitted closely to the\nfigure; over this was a hunting-jacket, trimmed with lace, short and\nopen in front; the hat, of gray felt, with a broad brim turned up in\nfront, was crowned with half a dozen red feathers. The hair, which was\nnot powdered, was drawn back from the face and fell down in two long\nplaits, like those of the Bernese women. Edmee's were so long that they\nalmost reached the ground.\n\nHer garb, to me so strangely fascinating, her youth and beauty, and the\nfavour with which she now seemed to regard my pretensions, combined to\nmake me mad with love and joy. I could imagine nothing more beautiful\nthan a lovely woman yielding without coarse words, and without tears of\nshame. My first impulse was to take her in my arms; but, as if overcome\nby that irresistible longing to worship which characterizes a first\nlove, even with the grossest of beings, I fell down before her and\npressed her knees to my breast; and yet, on my own supposition, it was\nto a shameless wanton that this homage was paid. I was none the less\nnigh to swooning from bliss.\n\nShe took my head between her two beautiful hands, and exclaimed:\n\n\"Ah, I was right! I knew quite well that you were not one of those\nreprobates. You are going to save me, aren't you? Thank God! How I\nthank you, O God! Must we jump from the window? Oh, I am not afraid;\ncome--come!\"\n\nI seemed as if awakened from a dream, and, I confess, the awakening was\nnot a little painful.\n\n\"What does this mean?\" I asked, as I rose to my feet. \"Are you still\njesting with me? Do you not know where you are? Do you think that I am a\nchild?\"\n\n\"I know that I am at Roche-Mauprat,\" she replied, turning pale again,\n\"and that I shall be outraged and assassinated in a couple of hours, if\nmeanwhile I do not succeed in inspiring you with some pity. But I shall\nsucceed,\" she cried, falling at my feet in her turn; \"you are not one of\nthose men. You are too young to be a monster like them. I could see from\nyour eyes that you pitied me. You will help me to escape, won't you,\nwon't you, my dear heart?\"\n\nShe took my hands and kissed them frenziedly, in the hope of moving me.\nI listened and looked at her with a sullen stupidity scarcely calculated\nto reassure her. My heart was naturally but little accessible to\nfeelings of generosity and compassion, and at this moment a passion\nstronger than all the rest was keeping down the impulse she had striven\nto arouse. I devoured her with my eyes, and made no effort to understand\nher words. I only wished to discover whether I was pleasing to her, or\nwhether she was trying to make use of me to effect her escape.\n\n\"I see that you are afraid,\" I said. \"You are wrong to be afraid of\nme. I shall certainly not do you any harm. You are too pretty for me to\nthink of anything but of caressing you.\"\n\n\"Yes; but your uncles will kill me,\" she cried; \"you know they will.\nSurely you would not have me killed? Since you love me, save me; I will\nlove you afterwards.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes; afterwards, afterwards,\" I answered, laughing with a silly,\nunbelieving air; \"after you have had me hanged by those gendarmes to\nwhom I have just given such a drubbing. Come, now; prove that you\nlove me at once; I will save you afterwards. You see, I can talk about\n'afterwards' too.\"\n\nI pursued her round the room. Though she fled from me, she gave no signs\nof anger, and still appealed to me with soft words. In me the poor girl\nwas husbanding her one hope, and was fearful of losing it. Ah, if I had\nonly been able to realize what such a woman as she was, and what my own\nposition meant! But I was unable then. I had but one fixed idea--the\nidea which a wolf may have on a like occasion.\n\nAt last, as my only answer to all her entreaties was, \"Do you love me,\nor are you fooling me?\" she saw what a brute she had to deal with, and,\nmaking up her mind accordingly, she came towards me, threw her arms\nround my neck, hid her face in my bosom, and let me kiss her hair. Then\nshe put me gently from her, saying:\n\n\"Ah, mon Dieu! don't you see how I love you--how I could not help loving\nyou from the very first moment I saw you? But don't you understand that\nI hate your uncles, and that I would be yours alone?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I replied, obstinately, \"because you say to yourself: 'This is a\nbooby whom I shall persuade to do anything I wish, by telling him that\nI love him; he will believe it, and I will take him away to be hanged.'\nCome; there is only one word which will serve if you love me.\"\n\nShe looked at me with an agonized air. I sought to press my lips to hers\nwhenever her head was not turned away. I held her hands in mine. She was\npowerless now to do more than delay the hour of her defeat. Suddenly\nthe colour rushed back to the pale face; she began to smile; and with an\nexpression of angelic coquetry, she asked:\n\n\"And you--do you love me?\"\n\nFrom this moment the victory was hers. I no longer had power to will\nwhat I wished. The lynx in me was subdued; the man rose in its place;\nand I believe that my voice had a human ring, as I cried for the first\ntime in my life:\n\n\"Yes, I love you! Yes, I love you!\"\n\n\"Well, then,\" she said, distractedly, and in a caressing tone, \"let us\nlove each other and escape together.\"\n\n\"Yes, let us escape,\" I answered. \"I loathe this house, and I loathe my\nuncles. I have long wanted to escape. And yet I shall only be hanged,\nyou know.\"\n\n\"They won't hang you,\" she rejoined with a laugh; \"my betrothed is a\nlieutenant-general.\"\n\n\"Your betrothed!\" I cried, in a fresh fit of jealousy more violent than\nthe first. \"You are going to be married?\"\n\n\"And why not?\" she replied, watching me attentively.\n\nI turned pale and clinched my teeth.\n\n\"In that case, . . .\" I said, trying to carry her off in my arms.\n\n\"In that case,\" she answered, giving me a little tap on the cheek, \"I\nsee that you are jealous; but his must be a particular jealousy who at\nten o'clock yearns for his mistress, only to hand her over at midnight\nto eight drunken men who will return her to him on the morrow as foul as\nthe mud on the roads.\"\n\n\"Ah, you are right!\" I exclaimed. \"Go, then; go. I would defend you to\nthe last drop of my blood; but I should be vanquished by numbers, and I\nshould die with the knowledge that you were left to them. How horrible!\nI shudder to think of it. Come--you must go.\"\n\n\"Yes! yes, my angel!\" she cried, kissing me passionately on the cheek.\n\nThese caresses, the first a woman had given me since my childhood,\nrecalled, I know not how or why, my mother's last kiss, and, instead of\npleasure, caused me profound sadness. I felt my eyes filling with tears.\nNoticing this, she kissed my tears, repeating the while:\n\n\"Save me! Save me!\"\n\n\"And your marriage?\" I asked. \"Oh! listen. Swear that you will not marry\nbefore I die. You will not have to wait long; for my uncles administer\nsound justice and swift, as they say.\"\n\n\"You are not going to follow me, then?\" she asked.\n\n\"Follow you? No; it is as well to be hanged here for helping you to\nescape as to be hanged yonder for being a bandit. Here, at least, I\navoid a twofold shame: I shall not be accounted an informer, and shall\nnot be hanged in a public place.\"\n\n\"I will not leave you here,\" she cried, \"though I die myself. Fly with\nme. You run no risk, believe me. Before God, I declare you are safe.\nKill me, if I lie. But let us start--quickly. O God! I hear them\nsinging. They are coming this way. Ah, if you will not defend me, kill\nme at once!\"\n\nShe threw herself into my arms. Love and jealousy were gradually\noverpowering me. Indeed, I even thought seriously of killing her; and I\nkept my hand on my hunting-knife as long as I heard any noise or voices\nnear the hall. They were exulting in their victory. I cursed Heaven for\nnot giving it to our foes. I clasped Edmee to my breast, and we remained\nmotionless in each other's arms, until a fresh report announced that the\nfight was beginning again. Then I pressed her passionately to my heart.\n\n\"You remind me,\" I said, \"of a poor little dove which one day flew into\nmy jacket to escape from a kite, and tried to hide itself in my bosom.\"\n\n\"And you did not give it up to the kite, did you?\" asked Edmee.\n\n\"No, by all the devils! not any more than I shall give you up, you, the\nprettiest of all the birds in the woods, to these vile night-birds that\nare threatening you.\"\n\n\"But how shall we escape?\" she cried, terror-stricken by the volleys\nthey were firing.\n\n\"Easily,\" I said. \"Follow me.\"\n\nI seized a torch, and lifting a trap-door, I made her descend with me to\nthe cellar. Thence we passed into a subterranean passage hollowed out\nof the rock. This, in bygone days had enabled the garrison, then more\nnumerous, to venture upon an important move in case of an attack; some\nof the besieged would emerge into the open country on the side opposite\nthe portcullis and fall on the rear of the besiegers, who were thus\ncaught between two fires. But many years had passed since the garrison\nof Roche-Mauprat was large enough to be divided into two bodies; and\nbesides, during the night it would have been folly to venture beyond the\nwalls. We arrived, therefore, at the exit of the passage without meeting\nwith any obstacle. But at the last moment I was seized with a fit of\nmadness. I threw down my torch, and leaned against the door.\n\n\"You shall not go out from here,\" I said to the trembling Edmee,\n\"without promising to be mine.\"\n\nWe were in darkness; the noise of the fight no longer reached us. Before\nany one could surprise us here we had ample time to escape. Everything\nwas in my favour. Edmee was now at the mercy of my caprice. When she saw\nthat the seductions of her beauty could no longer rouse me to ecstasy,\nshe ceased to implore, and drew backward a few steps.\n\n\"Open the door,\" she said, \"and go out first, or I will kill myself.\nSee, I have your hunting-knife. You left it by the side of the\ntrap-door. To return to your uncles you will have to walk through my\nblood.\"\n\nHer resolute manner frightened me.\n\n\"Give me that knife,\" I said, \"or, be the consequences what they may, I\nwill take it from you by force.\"\n\n\"Do you think I am afraid to die?\" she said calmly. \"If this knife had\nonly been in my hand yonder in the chateau, I should not have humbled\nmyself before you.\"\n\n\"Confound it!\" I cried, \"you have deceived me. Your love is a sham.\nBegone! I despise you. I will not follow such as you.\"\n\nAt the same time I opened the door.\n\n\"I would not go without you,\" she cried; \"and you--you would not have me\ngo without dishonour. Which of us is the more generous?\"\n\n\"You are mad,\" I said. \"You have lied to me; and you do not know what to\ndo to make a fool of me. However, you shall not go out from here without\nswearing that your marriage with the lieutenant-general or any other man\nshall not take place before you have been my mistress.\"\n\n\"Your mistress!\" she said. \"Are you dreaming? Could you not at least\nsoften the insult by saying your wife?\"\n\n\"That is what any one of my uncles would say in my place; because they\nwould care only about your dowry. But I--I yearn for nothing but your\nbeauty. Swear, then, that you will be mine first; afterwards you shall\nbe free, on my honour. And if my jealousy prove so fierce that it may\nnot be borne, well, since a man may not go from his word, I will blow my\nbrains out.\"\n\n\"I swear,\" said Edmee, \"to be no man's before being yours.\"\n\n\"That is not it. Swear to be mine before being any other's.\"\n\n\"It is the same thing,\" she answered. \"Yes; I swear it.\"\n\n\"On the gospel? On the name of Christ? By the salvation of your soul? By\nthe memory of your mother?\"\n\n\"On the gospel; in the name of Christ; by the salvation of my soul; by\nthe memory of my mother.\"\n\n\"Good.\"\n\n\"One moment,\" she rejoined; \"I want you to swear that my promise and its\nfulfilment shall remain a secret; that my father shall never know it, or\nany person who might tell him.\"\n\n\"No one in the world shall hear it from me. Why should I want others to\nknow, provided only that you keep your word?\"\n\nShe made me repeat the formula of an oath. Then we hurried forth into\nthe open, holding each other's hands as a sign of mutual trust.\n\nBut now our flight became dangerous. Edmee feared the besiegers almost\nas much as the besieged. We were fortunate enough not to meet any.\nStill, it was by no means easy to move quickly. The night was so dark\nthat we were continually running against trees, and the ground was so\nslippery that we were unable to avoid falls. A sudden noise made\nus start; but, from the rattle of the chain fixed on its foot,\nI immediately recognised my grandfather's horse, an animal of an\nextraordinary age, but still strong and spirited. It was the very horse\nthat had brought me to Roche-Mauprat ten years before. At present the\nonly thing that would serve as a bridle was the rope round its neck. I\npassed this through its mouth, and I threw my jacket over the crupper\nand helped my companion to mount; I undid the chain, sprang on the\nanimal's back, and urging it on desperately, made it set off at a\ngallop, happen what might. Luckily for us, it knew the paths better\nthan I, and, as if by instinct, followed their windings without knocking\nagainst any trees. However, it frequently slipped, and in recovering\nitself, gave us such jolts that we should have lost our seats a thousand\ntimes (equipped as we were) had we not been hanging between life and\ndeath. In such a strait desperate ventures are best, and God protects\nthose whom man pursues. We were congratulating ourselves on being out of\ndanger, when all at once the horse struck against a stump, and catching\nhis hoof in a root on the ground, fell down. Before we were up he had\nmade off into the darkness, and I could hear him galloping farther and\nfarther away. As we fell I had caught Edmee in my arms. She was unhurt.\nMy own ankle, however, was sprained so severely that it was impossible\nfor me to move a step. Edmee thought that my leg had been broken. I was\ninclined to think so myself, so great was the pain; but soon I thought\nno further either of my agony or my anxiety. Edmee's tender solicitude\nmade me forget everything. It was in vain that I urged her to continue\nher flight without me. I pointed out that she could now escape alone;\nthat we were some distance from the chateau; that day would soon\nbe breaking; that she would be certain to find some house, and that\neverywhere the people would protect her against the Mauprats.\n\n\"I will not leave you,\" she persisted in answering. \"You have devoted\nyourself to me; I will show the same devotion to you. We will both\nescape, or we will die together.\"\n\n\"I am not mistaken,\" I cried; \"it is a light that I see between the\nbranches. Edmee, there is a house yonder; go and knock at the door. You\nneed not feel anxious about leaving me here; and you will find a guide\nto take you home.\"\n\n\"Whatever happens,\" she said, \"I will not leave you; but I will try to\nfind some one to help you.\"\n\n\"Yet, no,\" I said, \"I will not let you knock at that door alone. That\nlight, in the middle of the night, in a house situated in the heart of\nthe woods, may be a lure.\"\n\nI dragged myself as far as the door. It felt cold, as if of metal. The\nwalls were covered with ivy.\n\n\"Who is there?\" cried some one within, before we had knocked.\n\n\"We are saved!\" cried Edmee; \"it is Patience's voice.\"\n\n\"We are lost!\" I said; \"he and I are mortal enemies.\n\n\"Fear nothing,\" she said; \"follow me. It was God that led us here.\"\n\n\"Yes, it was God that led you here, daughter of Heaven, morning star!\"\nsaid Patience, opening the door; \"and whoever is with you is welcome too\nat Gazeau Tower.\"\n\nWe entered under a surbased vault, in the middle of which hung an iron\nlamp. By the light of this dismal luminary and of a handful of brushwood\nwhich was blazing on the hearth we saw, not without surprise, that\nGazeau Tower was exceptionally honoured with visitors. On one side the\nlight fell upon the pale and serious face of a man in clerical garb. On\nthe other, a broad-brimmed hat overshadowed a sort of olive-green cone\nterminating in a scanty beard; and on the wall could be seen the shadow\nof a nose so distinctly tapered that nothing in the world might compare\nwith it except, perhaps, a long rapier lying across the knees of the\npersonage in question, and a little dog's face which, from its pointed\nshape, might have been mistaken for that of a gigantic rat. In fact, it\nseemed as if a mysterious harmony reigned between these three salient\npoints--the nose of Don Marcasse, his dog's snout, and the blade of his\nsword. He got up slowly and raised his hand to his hat. The Jansenist\ncure did the same. The dog thrust its head forward between its master's\nlegs, and, silent like him, showed its teeth and put back its ears\nwithout barking.\n\n\"Quiet, Blaireau!\" said Marcasse to it.\n\n\n\n\nVII\n\nNo sooner had the cure recognised Edmee than he started back with an\nexclamation of surprise. But this was nothing to the stupefaction of\nPatience when he had examined my features by the light of the burning\nbrand that served him as torch.\n\n\"The lamb in the company of the wolf!\" he cried. \"What has happened,\nthen?\"\n\n\"My friend,\" replied Edmee, putting, to my infinite astonishment, her\nlittle white hand into the sorcerer's big rough palm, \"welcome him as\nyou welcome me. I was a prisoner at Roche-Mauprat, and it was he who\nrescued me.\"\n\n\"May the sins of his fathers be forgiven him for this act!\" said the\ncure.\n\nPatience took me by the arm, without saying anything, and led me nearer\nthe fire. They seated me on the only chair in the house, and the cure\ntook upon himself the task of attending to my leg, while Edmee gave an\naccount, up to a certain point, of our adventure. Then she asked for\ninformation about the hunt and about her father. Patience, however,\ncould give her no news. He had heard the horn in the woods, and the\nfiring at the wolves had disturbed his tranquility several times during\nthe day. But since the storm broke over them the noise of the wind had\ndrowned all other sounds, and he knew nothing of what was taking place\nin Varenne. Marcasse, meanwhile, had very nimbly climbed a ladder which\nserved as an approach to the upper stories of the house, now that the\nstaircase was broken. His dog followed him with marvellous skill.\nSoon they came down again, and we learned that a red light could be\ndistinguished on the horizon in the direction of Roche-Mauprat. In spite\nof the loathing I had for this place and its owners, I could not repress\na feeling very much like consternation on hearing that the hereditary\nmanor which bore my own name had apparently been taken and set on fire.\nIt meant disgrace, defeat; and this fire was as a seal of vassalage\naffixed to my arms by those I called clodhoppers and serfs. I sprang up\nfrom my chair, and had I not been held back by the violent pain in my\nfoot, I believe I should have rushed out.\n\n\"What is the matter?\" said Edmee, who was by my side at the time.\n\n\"The matter is,\" I answered abruptly, \"that I must return yonder; for\nit is my duty to get killed rather than let my uncles parley with the\nrabble.\"\n\n\"The rabble!\" cried Patience, addressing me for the first time since I\narrived. \"Who dares to talk of rabble here? I myself am of the rabble.\nIt is my title, and I shall know how to make it respected.\"\n\n\"By Jove! Not by me,\" I said, pushing away the cure, who had made me sit\ndown again.\n\n\"And yet it would not be for the first time,\" replied Patience, with a\ncontemptuous smile.\n\n\"You remind me,\" I answered, \"that we two have some old accounts to\nsettle.\"\n\nAnd heedless of the frightful agony caused by my sprain, I rose again,\nand with a backhander I sent Don Marcasse, who was endeavouring the play\nthe cure's part of peacemaker, head over heels into the middle of the\nashes. I did not mean him any harm, but my movements were somewhat\nrough, and the poor man was so frail that to my hand he was but as a\nweasel would have been to his own. Patience was standing before me with\nhis arms crossed, in the attitude of a stoic philosopher, but the fire\nwas flashing in his eyes. Conscious of his position as my host, he was\nevidently waiting until I struck the first blow before attempting\nto crush me. I should not have kept him waiting long, had not Edmee,\nscorning the danger of interfering with a madman, seized my arm and\nsaid, in an authoritative tone:\n\n\"Sit down again, and be quiet; I command you.\"\n\nSo much boldness and confidence surprised and pleased me at the same\ntime. The rights which she arrogated to herself over me were, in some\nmeasure, a sanction of those I claimed to have over her.\n\n\"You are right,\" I answered, sitting down.\n\nAnd I added, with a glance at Patience:\n\n\"Some other time.\"\n\n\"Amen,\" he answered, shrugging his shoulders.\n\nMarcasse had picked himself up with much composure, and shaking off the\nashes with which he was covered, instead of finding fault with me, he\ntried, after his fashion to lecture Patience. This was in reality by no\nmeans easy to do; yet nothing could have been less irritating than that\nmonosyllabic censure throwing out its little note in the thick of a\nquarrel like an echo in a storm.\n\n\"At your age,\" he said to his host; \"not patient at all. Wholly to\nblame--yes--wrong--you!\"\n\n\"How naughty you are!\" Edmee said to me, putting her hand on my\nshoulder; \"do not begin again, or I shall go away and leave you.\"\n\nI willingly let myself be scolded by her; nor did I realize that during\nthe last minutes we had exchanged parts. The moment we crossed the\nthreshold of Gazeau Tower she had given evidence of that superiority\nover me which was really hers. This wild place, too, these strange\nwitnesses, this fierce host, had already furnished a taste of the\nsociety into which I had entered, and whose fetters I was soon to feel.\n\n\"Come,\" she said, turning to Patience, \"we do not understand each other\nhere; and, for my part, I am devoured by anxiety about my poor father,\nwho is no doubt searching for me, and wringing his hands at this very\nmoment. My good Patience, do find me some means of rejoining him with\nthis unfortunate boy, whom I dare not leave to your care, since you have\nnot sufficient love for me to be patient and compassionate with him.\"\n\n\"What do you say?\" said Patience, putting his hand to his brow as if\nwaking from a dream. \"Yes, you are right; I am an old brute, an old\nfool. Daughter of God, tell this boy, this nobleman, that I ask his\npardon for the past, and that, for the present, my poor cell is at his\ndisposal. Is that well said?\"\n\n\"Yes, Patience,\" answered the cure. \"Besides, everything may be managed.\nMy horse is quiet and steady, and Mademoiselle de Mauprat can ride it,\nwhile you and Marcasse lead it by the bridle. For myself, I will remain\nhere with our invalid. I promise to take good care of him and not to\nannoy him in any way. That will do, won't it, Monsieur Bernard? You\ndon't bear me any ill-will, and you may be very sure that I am not your\nenemy.\"\n\n\"I know nothing about it,\" I answered; \"it is as you please. Look after\nmy cousin; take her home safely. For my own part, I need nothing and\ncare for no one. A bundle of straw and a glass of wine, that is all I\nshould like, if it were possible to have them.\"\n\n\"You shall have both,\" said Marcasse, handing me his flask, \"but first\nof all here is something to cheer you up. I am going to the stable to\nget the horse ready.\"\n\n\"No, I will go myself,\" said Patience; \"you see to the wants of this\nyoung man.\"\n\nAnd he passed into another lower hall, which served as a stable for\nthe cure's horse during the visits which the good priest paid him. They\nbrought the animal through the room where we were; and Patience, after\narranging the cure's cloak on the saddle, with fatherly care helped\nEdmee to mount.\n\n\"One moment,\" she said, before letting them lead her out. \"Monsieur le\nCure, will you promise me on the salvation of your soul not to leave my\ncousin before I return with my father to fetch him?\"\n\n\"I promise solemnly,\" replied the cure.\n\n\"And you, Bernard,\" said Edmee, \"will you give me your word of honour to\nwait for me here?\"\n\n\"I can't say,\" I answered; \"that will depend on the length of your\nabsence and on my patience; but you know quite well, cousin, that we\nshall meet again, even if it be in hell; and for my part, the sooner the\nbetter.\"\n\nBy the light of the brand which Patience was holding to examine the\nhorse's harness, I saw her beautiful face flush and then turn pale. Then\nshe raised her eyes which had been lowered in sorrow, and looked at me\nfixedly with a strange expression.\n\n\"Are we ready to start?\" said Marcasse, opening the door.\n\n\"Yes, forward,\" said Patience, taking the bridle. \"Edmee, my child, take\ncare to bend down while passing under the door.\"\n\n\"What is the matter, Blaireau?\" said Marcasse, stopping on the threshold\nand thrusting out the point of his sword, gloriously rusted by the blood\nof the rodent tribe.\n\nBlaireau did not stir, and if he had not been born dumb, as his master\nsaid, he would have barked. But he gave warning as usual by a sort of\ndry cough. This was his most emphatic sign of anger and uneasiness.\n\n\"There must be something down there,\" said Marcasse; and he boldly\nadvanced into the darkness, after making a sign to the rider not to\nfollow. The report of firearms made us all start. Edmee jumped down\nlightly from her horse, and I did not fail to notice that some impulse\nat once prompted her to come and stand behind my chair. Patience rushed\nout of the tower. The cure ran to the frightened horse, which was\nrearing and backing toward us. Blaireau managed to bark. I forgot my\nsprain, and in a single bound I was outside.\n\nA man covered with wounds, and with the blood streaming from him, was\nlying across the doorway. It was my Uncle Laurence. He had been mortally\nwounded at the siege of Roche-Mauprat, and had come to die under our\neyes. With him was his brother Leonard, who had just fired his last\npistol shot at random, luckily without hitting any one. Patience's\nfirst impulse was to prepare to defend himself. On recognising Marcasse,\nhowever, the fugitives, far from showing themselves hostile, asked for\nshelter and help. As their situation was so desperate no one thought\nthat assistance should be refused. The police were pursuing them.\nRoche-Mauprat was in flames; Louis and Peter had died fighting; Antony,\nJohn, and Walter had fled in another direction, and, perhaps, were\nalready prisoners. No words would paint the horror of Laurence's last\nmoments. His agony was brief but terrible. His blasphemy made the cure\nturn pale. Scarce had the door been shut and the dying man laid on the\nfloor than the horrible death-rattle was heard. Leonard, who knew of no\nremedy but brandy, snatched Marcasse's flask out of my hand (not without\nswearing and scornfully reproaching me for my flight), forced open his\nbrother's clinched teeth with the blade of his hunting-knife, and,\nin spite of our warning, poured half the flask down his throat. The\nwretched man bounded into the air, brandished his arms in desperate\nconvulsions, drew himself up to his full height, and fell back stone\ndead upon the blood-stained floor. There was no time to offer up a\nprayer over the body, for the door resounded under the furious blows of\nour assailants.\n\n\"Open in the King's name!\" cried several voices; \"open to the police!\"\n\n\"Help! help!\" cried Leonard, seizing his knife and rushing towards the\ndoor. \"Peasants, prove yourselves nobles! And you, Bernard, atone for\nyour fault; wash out your shame; do not let a Mauprat fall into the\nhands of the gendarmes alive!\"\n\nUrged on by native courage and by pride, I was about to follow his\nexample, when Patience rushed at him, and exerting his herculean\nstrength, threw him to the ground. Putting one knee on his chest, he\ncalled to Marcasse to open the door. This was done before I could take\nmy uncle's part against his terrible assailant. Six gendarmes at once\nrushed into the tower and, with their guns pointed, bade us move at our\nperil.\n\n\"Stay, gentlemen,\" said Patience, \"don't harm any one. This is your\nprisoner. Had I been alone with him, I should either have defended him\nor helped him to escape; but there are honest people here who ought not\nto suffer for a knave; and I did not wish to expose them to a fight.\nHere is the Mauprat. Your duty, as you know, is to deliver him safe and\nsound into the hands of justice. This other is dead.\"\n\n\"Monsieur, surrender!\" said the sergeant of the gendarmes, laying his\nhand on Leonard.\n\n\"Never shall a Mauprat drag his name into the dock of a police court,\"\nreplied Leonard, with a sullen expression. \"I surrender, but you will\nget nothing but my skin.\"\n\nAnd he allowed himself to be placed in a chair without making any\nresistance.\n\nBut while they were preparing to bind him he said to the cure:\n\n\"Do me one last kindness, Father. Give me what is left in the flask; I\nam dying of thirst and exhaustion.\"\n\nThe good cure handed him the flask, which he emptied at a draught. His\ndistorted face took on an expression of awful calm. He seemed absorbed,\nstunned, incapable of resistance. But as soon as they were engaged\nin binding his feet, he snatched a pistol from the belt of one of the\ngendarmes and blew his brains out.\n\nThis frightful spectacle completely unnerved me. Sunk in a dull stupor,\nno longer conscious of what was happening around me, I stood there as if\nturned to stone, and it was only after some minutes that I realized\nthat I was the subject of a serious discussion between the police and\nmy hosts. One of the gendarmes declared that he recognised me as a\nHamstringer Mauprat. Patience declared that I was nothing but M. Hubert\nde Mauprat's gamekeeper, in charge of his daughter. Annoyed at the\ndiscussion, I was about to make myself known when I saw a ghost rise\nby my side. It was Edmee. She had taken refuge between the wall and the\ncure's poor frightened horse, which, with outstretched legs and eyes\nof fire, made her a sort of rampart with its body. She was as pale as\ndeath, and her lips were so compressed with horror that at first, in\nspite of desperate efforts to speak, she was unable to express herself\notherwise than by signs. The sergeant, moved by her youth and her\npainful situation, waited with deference until she could manage to make\nherself understood. At last she persuaded them not to treat me as a\nprisoner, but to take me with her to her father's chateau, where she\ngave her word of honour that satisfactory explanations and guarantees\nwould be furnished on my account. The cure and the other witnesses,\nhaving pledged their words to this, we set out all together, Edmee\non the sergeant's horse, he on an animal belonging to one of his men,\nmyself on the cure's, Patience and the cure afoot between us, the police\non either side, and Marcasse in front, still impassive amid the general\nterror and consternation. Two of the gendarmes remained behind to guard\nthe bodies and prepare a report.\n\n\n\n\nVIII\n\nWe had travelled about a league through the woods. Wherever other paths\nhad crossed our own, we had stopped to call aloud; for Edmee, convinced\nthat her father would not return home without finding her, had implored\nher companions to help her to rejoin him. To this shouting the gendarmes\nhad been very averse, as they were afraid of being discovered and\nattacked by bodies of the fugitives from Roche-Mauprat. On our way they\ninformed us that this den had been captured at the third assault. Until\nthen the assailants had husbanded their forces. The officer in command\nof the gendarmes was anxious to get possession of the keep without\ndestroying it; and, above all, to take the defenders alive. This,\nhowever, was impossible on account of the desperate resistance they\nmade. The besiegers suffered so severely in their second attempt that\nthey found themselves compelled to adopt extreme measures or to retreat.\nThey therefore set the outer buildings on fire, and in the ensuing\nassault put forth all their strength. Two Mauprats were killed while\nfighting on the ruins of their bastion; the other five disappeared. Six\nmen were dispatched in pursuit of them in one direction, six in another.\nTraces of the fugitives had been discovered immediately, and the men who\ngave us these details had followed Laurence and Leonard so closely that\nseveral of their shots had hit the former only a short distance from\nGazeau Tower. They had heard him cry that he was done for; and, as far\nas they could see, Leonard had carried him to the sorcerer's door. This\nLeonard was the only one of my uncles who deserved any pity, for he was\nthe only one who might, perhaps, have been encouraged to a better kind\nof life. At times there was a touch of chivalry in his brigandage,\nand his savage heart was capable of affection. I was deeply moved,\ntherefore, by his tragic death, and let myself be carried along\nmechanically, plunged in gloomy thoughts, and determined to end my days\nin the same manner should I ever be condemned to the disgrace he had\nscorned to endure.\n\nAll at once the sound of horns and the baying of hounds announced the\napproach of a party of huntsmen. While we, on our side, were answering\nwith shouts, Patience ran to meet them. Edmee, longing to see her father\nagain, and forgetting all the horrors of this bloody night, whipped\nup her horse and reached the hunters first. As soon as we came up with\nthem, I saw Edmee in the arms of a tall man with a venerable face. He\nwas richly dressed; his hunting-coat, with gold lace over all the seams,\nand the magnificent Norman horse, which a groom was holding behind him,\nso struck me that I thought I was in the presence of a prince. The signs\nof love which he was showing his daughter were so new to me that I was\ninclined to deem them exaggerated and unworthy of the dignity of a man.\nAt the same time they filled me with a sort of brute jealousy; for it\ndid not occur to my mind that a man so splendidly dressed could be\nmy uncle. Edmee was speaking to him in a low voice, but with great\nanimation. Their conversation lasted a few moments. At the end of it the\nold man came and embraced me cordially. Everything about these manners\nseemed so new to me, that I responded neither by word nor gesture to the\nprotestations and caresses of which I was the object. A tall young man,\nwith a handsome face, as elegantly dressed as M. Hubert, also came and\nshook my hand and proffered thanks; why, I could not understand. He next\nentered into a discussion with the gendarmes, and I gathered that he was\nthe lieutenant-general of the province, and that he was ordering them\nto set me at liberty for the present, that I might accompany my uncle to\nhis chateau, where he undertook to be responsible for me. The gendarmes\nthen left us, for the chevalier and the lieutenant-general were\nsufficiently well escorted by their own men not to fear attack from\nany one. A fresh cause of astonishment for me was to see the chevalier\nbestowing marks of warm friendship on Patience and Marcasse. As for the\ncure, he was upon a footing of equality with these seigneurs. For some\nmonths he had been chaplain at the chateau of Saint-Severe, having\npreviously been compelled to give up his living by the persecutions of\nthe diocesan clergy.\n\nAll this tenderness of which Edmee was the object, this family affection\nso completely new to me, the genuinely cordial relations existing\nbetween respectful plebeians and kindly patricians--everything that I\nnow saw and heard seemed like a dream. I looked on with a sensation that\nit was all unintelligible to me. However, soon after our caravan started\nmy brain began to work; for I then saw the lieutenant-general (M. de\nla Marche) thrust his horse between Edmee's and my own, as if he had a\nright to be next to her. I remembered her telling me at Roche-Mauprat\nthat he was her betrothed. Hatred and anger at once surged up within me,\nand I know not what absurdity I should have committed, had not Edmee,\napparently divining the workings of my unruly soul, told him that she\nwanted to speak to me, and thus restored me to my place by her side.\n\n\"What have you to say to me?\" I asked with more eagerness than\npoliteness.\n\n\"Nothing,\" she answered in an undertone. \"I shall have much to say\nlater. Until then will you do everything I ask of you?\"\n\n\"And why the devil should I do everything you ask of me, cousin?\"\n\nFor a moment she hesitated to reply; then, making an effort, she said:\n\n\"Because it is thus that a man proves to a woman that he loves her.\"\n\n\"Do you believe that I don't love you?\" I replied abruptly.\n\n\"How should I know?\" she said.\n\nThis doubt astonished me very much, and I tried to combat it after my\nfashion.\n\n\"Are you not beautiful?\" I said; \"and am not I a young man? Perhaps you\nthink I am too much of a boy to notice a woman's beauty; but now that my\nhead is calm, and I am sad and quite serious, I can assure you that I am\neven more deeply in love with you than I thought. The more I look at you\nthe more beautiful you seem. I did not think that a woman could be so\nlovely. I tell you I shall not sleep till . . .\"\n\n\"Hold your tongue,\" she said sharply.\n\n\"Oh, I suppose you are afraid that man will hear me,\" I answered,\npointing to M. de la Marche. \"Have no fear; I know how to keep my word;\nand, as you are the daughter of a noble house, I hope you know how to\nkeep yours.\"\n\nShe did not reply. We had reached a part of the road where it was\nonly possible for two to walk abreast. The darkness was profound, and\nalthough the chevalier and the lieutenant-general were at our heels, I\nwas going to make bold to put my arm round her waist, when she said to\nme, in a sad and weary voice:\n\n\"Cousin, forgive me for not talking to you. I'm afraid I did not quite\nunderstand what you said. I am so exhausted that I feel as if I were\ngoing to die. Luckily, we have reached home now. Promise me that you\nwill love my father, that you will yield to all his wishes, that you\nwill decide nothing without consulting me. Promise me this if you would\nhave me believe in your friendship.\"\n\n\"Oh, my friendship? you are welcome not to believe in that,\" I answered;\n\"but you must believe in my love. I promise everything you wish. And\nyou, will you not promise me anything? Do, now, with a good grace.\"\n\n\"What can I promise that is not yours?\" she said in a serious tone. \"You\nsaved my honour; my life belongs to you.\"\n\nThe first glimmerings of dawn were now beginning to light the horizon.\nWe had reached the village of Saint-Severe, and soon afterward we\nentered the courtyard of the chateau. On dismounting from her horse\nEdmee fell into her father's arms; she was as pale as death. M. de la\nMarche uttered a cry, and helped to carry her away. She had fainted.\nThe cure took charge of me. I was very uneasy about my fate. The natural\ndistrust of the brigand sprang up again as soon as I ceased to be under\nthe spell of her who had managed to lure me from my den. I was like a\nwounded wolf; I cast sullen glances about me, ready to rush at the first\nbeing who should stir my suspicions by a doubtful word or deed. I was\ntaken into a splendid room, and a meal, prepared with a luxury far\nbeyond anything I could have conceived, was immediately served. The\ncure displayed the kindest interest in me; and, having succeeded in\nreassuring me a little, he went to attend to his friend Patience. The\ndisturbed state of my mind and my remnant of uneasiness were not\nproof against the generous appetite of youth. Had it not been for the\nrespectful assiduity of a valet much better dressed than myself, who\nstood behind my chair, and whose politeness I could not help returning\nwhenever he hastened to anticipate my wants, I should have made\na terrific breakfast; as it was, the green coat and silk breeches\nembarrassed me considerably. It was much worse when, going down on his\nknees, he set about taking off my boots preparatory to putting me to\nbed. For the moment I thought he was playing a trick upon me, and came\nvery near giving him a good blow on the head; but his manner was so\nserious as he went through this task that I sat and stared at him in\namazement.\n\nAt first, at finding myself in bed without arms, and with people\nentering and leaving my room always on tip-toe, I again began to feel\nsuspicious. I took advantage of a moment when I was alone to get out of\nbed and take from the table, which was only half cleared, the longest\nknife I could find. Feeling easier in my mind, I returned to bed and\nfell into a sound sleep, with the knife firmly clasped in my hand.\n\nWhen I awoke again the rays of the setting sun, softened by my red\ndamask curtains, were falling on my beautifully fine sheets and lighting\nup the golden pomegranates that adorned the corners of the bed. This bed\nwas so handsome and soft that I felt inclined to make it my apologies\nfor having slept in it. As I was about to get up I saw a kindly,\nvenerable face looking through the half-drawn curtains and smiling. It\nwas the Chevalier Hubert de Mauprat. He inquired anxiously about\nthe state of my health. I endeavoured to be polite and to express my\ngratitude; but the language I used seemed so different from his that\nI was disconcerted and pained at my awkwardness without being able to\nrealize why. To crown my misery, a movement that I made caused the\nknife which I had taken as bedfellow to fall at M. de Mauprat's feet. He\npicked it up, looked at it, and then at myself with extreme surprise. I\nturned as red as fire and stammered out I know not what. I expected he\nwould reprove me for this insult to his hospitality. However, he was too\npolite to insist upon a more complete explanation. He quietly placed the\nknife on the mantel-piece and, returning to me, spoke as follows:\n\n\"Bernard, I now know that I owe to you the life that I hold dearest in\nthe world. All my own life shall be devoted to giving you proofs of my\ngratitude and esteem. My daughter also is sacredly indebted to you. You\nneed, then, have no anxiety about your future. I know what persecution\nand vengeance you exposed yourself to in coming to us; but I know, too,\nfrom what a frightful existence my friendship and devotion will be able\nto deliver you. You are an orphan, and I have no son. Will you have me\nfor your father?\"\n\nI stared at the chevalier with wild eyes. I could not believe my ears.\nAll feeling within me seemed paralyzed by astonishment and timidity. I\nwas unable to answer a word. The chevalier himself evidently felt\nsome astonishment; he had not expected to find a nature so brutishly\nill-conditioned.\n\n\"Come,\" he said; \"I hope that you will grow accustomed to us. At all\nevents, shake hands, to show that you trust me. I will send up your\nservant; give him your orders; he is at your disposal. I have only one\npromise to exact from you, and that is that you will not go beyond the\nwalls of the park until I have taken steps to make you safe from the\npursuit of justice. At present it is possible that the charges which\nhave been hanging over your uncles' heads might be made to fall on your\nown.\"\n\n\"My uncles!\" I exclaimed, putting my hand to my brow. \"Is this all a\nhideous dream? Where are they? What has become of Roche-Mauprat?\"\n\n\"Roche-Mauprat,\" he answered, \"has been saved from the flames. Only\na few of the outer buildings have been destroyed; but I undertake to\nrepair the house and to redeem your fief from the creditors who claim\nit. As to your uncles . . . you are probably the sole heir of a name\nthat it behoves you to rehabilitate.\"\n\n\"The sole heir?\" I cried. \"Four Mauprats fell last night; but the other\nthree . . .\"\n\n\"The fifth, Walter, perished in his attempt to escape. His body was\ndiscovered this morning in the pond of Les Froids. Neither John nor\nAntony has been caught, but the horse belonging to one and a cloak of\nthe other's, found near the spot where Walter's body was lying, seem to\nhint darkly that their fate was as his. Even if one of them manages to\nescape, he will never dare make himself known again, for there would\nbe no hope for him. And since they have drawn down upon their heads\nthe inevitable storm, it is best, both for themselves and for us, who\nunfortunately bear the same name, that they should have come to this\ntragic end--better to have fallen weapon in hand, than to have suffered\nan infamous death upon the gallows. Let us bow to what God has ordained\nfor them. It is a stern judgment; seven men in the pride of youth and\nstrength summoned in a single night to their terrible reckoning! . . .\nWe must pray for them, Bernard, and by dint of good works try to make\ngood the evil they have done, and remove the stains they have left on\nour escutcheon.\"\n\nThese concluding words summed up the chevalier's whole character. He was\npious, just, and full of charity; but, with him, as with most nobles,\nthe precepts of Christian humility were wont to fall before the pride\nof rank. He would gladly have had a poor man at his table, and on Good\nFriday, indeed, he used to wash the feet of twelve beggars; but he was\nnone the less attached to all the prejudices of our caste. In trampling\nunder foot the dignity of man, my cousins, he considered, had,\nas noblemen, been much more culpable than they would have been as\nplebeians. On the latter hypothesis, according to him, their crimes\nwould not have been half so grave. For a long time I shared the\nconviction myself; it was in my blood, if I may use the expression. I\nlost it only in the stern lessons of my destiny.\n\nHe then confirmed what his daughter had told me. From my birth he had\nearnestly desired to undertake my education. But his brother Tristan\nhad always stubbornly opposed this desire. There the chevalier's brow\ndarkened.\n\n\"You do not know,\" he said, \"how baneful have been the consequences of\nthat simple wish of mine--baneful for me, and for you too. But that must\nremain wrapped in mystery--a hideous mystery, the blood of the\nAtridae. . . .\"\n\nHe took my hand, and added, in a broken voice:\n\n\"Bernard, we are both of us victims of a vicious family. This is not\nthe moment to pile up charges against those who in this very hour are\nstanding before the terrible tribunal of God; but they have done me an\nirreparable wrong--they have broken my heart. The wrong they have done\nyou shall be repaired--I swear it by the memory of your mother. They\nhave deprived you of education; they have made you a partner in their\nbrigandage; yet your soul has remained great and pure as was the soul of\nthe angel who gave you birth. You will correct the mistakes which others\nmade in your childhood; you will receive an education suitable to your\nrank. And then, Bernard, you will restore the honour of your family. You\nwill, won't you? Promise me this, Bernard. It is the one thing I long\nfor. I will throw myself at your knees if so I may win your confidence;\nand I shall win it, for Providence has destined you to be my son. Ah,\nonce it was my dream that you should be more completely mine. If, when\nI made my second petition, they had granted you to my loving care, you\nwould have been brought up with my daughter and you would certainly have\nbecome her husband. But God would not have it so. You have now to begin\nyour education, whereas hers is almost finished. She is of an age to\nmarry; and, besides, her choice is already made. She loves M. de la\nMarche; in fact, their marriage is soon to take place. Probably she had\ntold you.\"\n\nI stammered out a few confused words. The affection and generous ideas\nof this noble man had moved me profoundly, and I was conscious of a new\nnature, as it were, awakening within me. But when he pronounced the name\nof his future son-in-law, all my savage instincts rose up again, and I\nfelt that no principle of social loyalty would make me renounce my claim\nto her whom I regarded as my fairly won prize. I grew pale; I grew red;\nI gasped for breath. Luckily, we were interrupted by the Abbe Aubert\n(the Jansenist cure), who came to inquire how I was after my fall. Then\nfor the first time the chevalier heard of my accident; an incident that\nhad escaped him amid the press of so many more serious matters. He sent\nfor his doctor at once, and I was overwhelmed with kind attentions,\nwhich seemed to me rather childish, but to which I submitted from a\nsense of gratitude.\n\nI had not dared to ask the chevalier for any news of his daughter. With\nthe abbe, however, I was bolder. He informed me that the length and\nuneasiness of her sleep were causing some anxiety; and the doctor, when\nhe returned in the evening to dress my ankle, told me that she was very\nfeverish, and that he was afraid she was going to have some serious\nillness.\n\nFor a few days, indeed, she was ill enough to cause anxiety. In the\nterrible experience she had gone through she had displayed great energy;\nbut the reaction was correspondingly violent. For myself, I was also\nkept to my bed. I could not take a step without feeling considerable\npain, and the doctor threatened that I should be laid up for several\nmonths if I did not submit to inaction for a few days. As I was\notherwise in vigorous health, and had never been ill in my life, the\nchange from any active habits to this sluggish captivity caused me\nindescribable _ennui_. Only those who have lived in the depths of woods,\nand experienced all the hardships of a rough life, can understand the\nkind of horror and despair I felt on finding myself shut up for more\nthan a week between four silk curtains. The luxuriousness of my room,\nthe gilding of my bed, the minute attentions of the lackeys, everything,\neven to the excellence of the food--trifles which I had somewhat\nappreciated the first day--became odious to me at the end of twenty-four\nhours. The chevalier paid me affectionate but short visits; for he\nwas absorbed by the illness of his darling daughter. The abbe was all\nkindness. To neither did I dare confess how wretched I felt; but when I\nwas alone I felt inclined to roar like a caged lion; and at night I had\ndreams in which the moss in the woods, the curtain of forest trees, and\neven the gloomy battlements of Roche-Mauprat, appeared to me like an\nearthly paradise. At other times, the tragic scenes that had accompanied\nand followed my escape were reproduced so vividly by my memory that,\neven when awake, I was a prey to a sort of delirium.\n\nA visit from M. de la Marche stirred my ideas to still wilder disorder.\nHe displayed the deepest interest in me, shook me by the hand again and\nagain, and implored my friendship, vowed a dozen times that he would lay\ndown his life for me, and made I don't know how many other protestations\nwhich I scarcely heard, for his voice was like a raging torrent in my\nears, and if I had had my hunting-knife I believe I should have thrown\nmyself upon him. My rough manners and sullen looks astonished him very\nmuch; but, the abbe having explained that my mind was disturbed by\nthe terrible events which had happened in my family, he renewed his\nprotestations, and took leave of me in the most affectionate and\ncourteous manner.\n\nThis politeness which I found common to everybody, from the master\nof the house to the meanest of his servants, though it struck me with\nadmiration, yet made me feel strangely ill at ease; for, even if it had\nnot been inspired by good-will towards me, I could never have brought\nmyself to understand that it might be something very different from real\ngoodness. It bore so little resemblance to the facetious braggadocio of\nthe Mauprats, that it seemed to me like an entirely new language, which\nI understood but could not speak.\n\nHowever, I recovered the power of speech when the abbe announced that\nhe was to have charge of my education, and began questioning me about\nmy attainments. My ignorance was so far beyond anything he could have\nimagined that I was getting ashamed to lay it all bare; and, my savage\npride getting the upper hand, I declared that I was a gentleman, and had\nno desire to become a clerk. His only answer was a burst of laughter,\nwhich offended me greatly. He tapped me quickly on the shoulder, with\na good-natured smile, saying that I should change my mind in time, but\nthat I was certainly a funny fellow. I was purple with rage when the\nchevalier entered. The abbe told him of our conversation and of my\nlittle speech. M. Hubert suppressed a smile.\n\n\"My boy,\" he said, in a kind tone, \"I trust I may never do anything to\nannoy you, even from affection. Let us talk no more about work to-day.\nBefore conceiving a taste for it you must first realize its necessity.\nSince you have a noble heart you can not but have a sound mind; the\ndesire for knowledge will come to you of itself. And now to supper. I\nexpect you are hungry. Do you like wine?\"\n\n\"Much better than Latin,\" I replied.\n\n\"Come, abbe,\" he continued laughingly, \"as a punishment for having\nplayed the pedant you must drink with us. Edmee is now quite out of\ndanger. The doctor has said that Bernard can get up and walk a few\nsteps. We will have supper served in this room.\"\n\nThe supper and wine were so good, indeed, that I was not long in getting\ntipsy, according to the Roche-Mauprat custom. I even saw they aided and\nabetted, in order to make me talk, and show at once what species of boor\nthey had to deal with. My lack of education surpassed anything they had\nanticipated; but I suppose they augured well from my native powers; for,\ninstead of giving me up, they laboured at the rough block with a zeal\nwhich showed at least that they were not without hope. As soon as I was\nable to leave my room I lost the feeling of _ennui_. The abbe was my\ninseparable companion through the whole first day. The length of the\nsecond was diminished by the hope they gave me of seeing Edmee on the\nmorrow, and by the kindness I experienced from every one. I began to\nfeel the charm of these gentle manners in proportion as I ceased to be\nastonished at them. The never-failing goodness of the chevalier could\nnot but overcome my boorishness; nay, more, it rapidly won my heart.\nThis was the first affection of my life. It took up its abode in me side\nby side with a violent love for his daughter, nor did I even dream of\npitting one of these feelings against the other. I was all yearning,\nall instinct, all desire. I had the passions of a man in the soul of a\nchild.\n\n\n\n\nIX\n\nAt last, one morning after breakfast, Mr. Hubert took me to see his\ndaughter. When the door of her room was opened I felt almost suffocated\nby the warm-scented air which met me. The room itself was charming\nin its simplicity; the curtains and coverings of chintz, with a white\nground. Large china vases filled with flowers exhaled a delicate\nperfume. African birds were sporting in a gilded cage, and singing their\nsweet little love songs. The carpet was softer to the feet than is\nthe moss of the woods in the month of March. I was in such a state of\nagitation that my eyes grew more and more dim every moment. My feet\ncaught in one another most awkwardly, and I kept stumbling against the\nfurniture without being able to advance. Edmee was lying on a long white\nchair, carelessly fingering a mother-of-pearl fan. She seemed to me\neven more beautiful than before, yet so changed that a feeling of\napprehension chilled me in the middle of my ecstasy. She held out her\nhand to me; I did not like to kiss it in the presence of her father. I\ncould not hear what she was saying to me--I believe her words were full\nof affection. Then, as if overcome with fatigue, she let her head fall\nback on the pillow and closed her eyes.\n\n\"I have some work to do,\" said the chevalier to me. \"Stay here with her;\nbut do not make her talk too much, for she is still very weak.\"\n\nThis recommendation really seemed a sarcasm. Edmee was pretending to be\nsleepy, perhaps to conceal some of the embarrassment that weighed on her\nheart; and, as for myself, I felt so incapable of overcoming her reserve\nthat it was in reality a kindness to counsel silence.\n\nThe chevalier opened a door at one end of the room and closed it after\nhim; but, as I could hear him cough from time to time, I gathered\nthat his study was separated from his daughter's room only by a wooden\npartition. Still, it was bliss to be alone with her for a few moments,\nas long as she appeared to be asleep. She did not see me, and I could\ngaze on her at will. So pale was she that she seemed as white as her\nmuslin dressing-gown, or as her satin slippers with their trimming of\nswan's down. Her delicate, transparent hand was to my eyes like some\nunknown jewel. Never before had I realized what a woman was; beauty for\nme had hitherto meant youth and health, together with a sort of manly\nhardihood. Edmee, in her riding-habit, as I first beheld her, had in\na measure displayed such beauty, and I had understood her better then.\nNow, as I studied her afresh, my very ideas, which were beginning to\nget a little light from without, all helped to make this second\n_tete-a-tete_ very different from the first.\n\nBut the strange, uneasy pleasure I experienced in gazing on her was\ndisturbed by the arrival of a duenna, a certain Mademoiselle Leblanc,\nwho performed the duties of lady's maid in Edmee's private apartments,\nand filled the post of companion in the drawing-room. Perhaps she had\nreceived orders from her mistress not to leave us. Certain it is that\nshe took her place by the side of the invalid's chair in such a way as\nto present to my disappointed gaze her own long, meagre back, instead of\nEdmee's beautiful face. Then she took some work out of her pocket, and\nquietly began to knit. Meanwhile the birds continued to warble, the\nchevalier to cough, Edmee to sleep or to pretend to sleep, while I\nremained at the other end of the room with my head bent over the prints\nin a book that I was holding upside down.\n\nAfter some time I became aware that Edmee was not asleep, and that she\nwas talking to her attendant in a low voice. I fancied I noticed the\nlatter glancing at me from time to time out of the corner of her eye in\na somewhat stealthy manner. To escape the ordeal of such an examination,\nand also from an impulse of cunning, which was by no means foreign to my\nnature, I let my head fall on the book, and the book on the pier-table,\nand in this posture I remained as if buried in sleep or thought. Then,\nlittle by little, their voices grew louder, until I could hear what they\nwere saying about me.\n\n\"It's all the same; you have certainly have chosen a funny sort of page,\nmademoiselle.\"\n\n\"A page, Leblanc! Why do you talk such nonsense? As if one had pages\nnowadays! You are always imagining we are still in my grandmother's\ntime. I tell you he is my father's adopted son.\"\n\n\"M. le Chevalier is undoubtedly quite right to adopt a son; but where on\nearth did he fish up such a creature as that?\"\n\nI gave a side glance at them and saw that Edmee was laughing behind her\nfan. She was enjoying the chatter of this old maid, who was supposed to\nbe a wag and allowed perfect freedom of speech. I was very much hurt to\nsee my cousin was making fun of me.\n\n\"He looks like a bear, a badger, a wolf, a kite, anything rather than\na man,\" continued Leblanc. \"What hands! what legs! And now he has been\ncleaned up a little, he is nothing to what he was! You ought to have\nseen him the day he arrived with his smock and his leather gaiters; it\nwas enough to take away one's breath.\"\n\n\"Do you think so?\" answered Edmee. \"For my part, I preferred him in his\npoacher's garb. It suited his face and figure better.\"\n\n\"He looked like a bandit. You could not have looked at him properly,\nmademoiselle.\"\n\n\"Oh! yes, I did.\"\n\nThe tone in which she pronounced these words, \"Yes, I did,\" made me\nshudder; and somehow I again felt upon my lips the impress of the kiss\nshe had given me at Roche-Mauprat.\n\n\"It would not be so bad if his hair were dressed properly,\" continued\nthe duenna; \"but, so far, no one had been able to persuade him to have\nit powdered. Saint-Jean told me that just as he was about to put the\npowder puff to his head he got up in a rage and said, 'Anything you like\nexcept that confounded flour. I want to be able to move my head about\nwithout coughing and sneezing.' Heavens, what a savage!\"\n\n\"Yet, in reality, he is quite right. If fashion did not sanction\nthe absurdity, everybody would perceive that it is both ugly and\ninconvenient. Look and see if it is not more becoming to have long black\nhair like his?\"\n\n\"Long hair like that? What a mane. It is enough to frighten one.\"\n\n\"Besides, boys do not have their hair powdered, and he is still a boy.\"\n\n\"A boy? My stars! what a brat Boys? Why he would eat them for his\nbreakfast; he's a regular ogre. But where does the hulking dog spring\nfrom? I suppose M. le Chevalier brought him here from behind some\nplough. What is his name again? . . . You did tell me his name, didn't\nyou?\"\n\n\"Yes, inquisitive; I told you he is called Bernard.\"\n\n\"Bernard! And nothing else?\"\n\n\"Nothing, for the present. What are you looking at?\"\n\n\"He is sleeping like a dormouse. Look at the booby. I was wondering\nwhether he resembled M. le Chevalier. Perhaps it was a momentary\nerror--a fit of forgetfulness with some milk-maid.\"\n\n\"Come, come, Leblanc; you are going too far . . .\"\n\n\"Goodness gracious, mademoiselle, has not M. le Chevalier been young\nlike any other man? And that does not prevent virtue coming on with\nyears, does it?\"\n\n\"Doubtless your own experience has shown you that this is possible. But\nlisten: don't take upon yourself to make fun of this young man. It is\npossible that you have guessed right; but my father requires him to be\ntreated as one of the family.\"\n\n\"Well, well; that must be pleasant for you, mademoiselle. As for myself,\nwhat does it matter to me? I have nothing to do with the gentleman.\"\n\n\"Ah, if you were thirty years younger.\"\n\n\"But did your father consult you, mademoiselle, before planting yon\ngreat brigand in your room?\"\n\n\"Why ask such a question? Is there anywhere in the world a better father\nthan mine?\"\n\n\"But you are very good also. . . . There are many young ladies who would\nhave been by no means pleased.\"\n\n\"And why, I should like to know? There is nothing disagreeable about the\nfellow. When he has been polished a little . . .\"\n\n\"He will always be perfectly ugly.\"\n\n\"My dear Leblanc, he is far from ugly. You are too old; you are no\nlonger a judge of young men.\"\n\nTheir conversation was interrupted by the chevalier, who came in to look\nfor a book.\n\n\"Mademoiselle Leblanc is here, is she?\" he said in a very quiet tone.\n\"I thought you were alone with my son. Well, Edmee, have you had a talk\nwith him? Did you tell him that you would be his sister? Are you pleased\nwith her, Bernard?\"\n\nSuch answers as I gave could compromise no one. As a rule, they\nconsisted of four or five incoherent words crippled by shame. M. de\nMauprat returned to his study, and I had sat down again, hoping that\nmy cousin was going to send away her duenna and talk to me. But they\nexchanged a few words in a whisper; the duenna remained, and two mortal\nhours passed without my daring to stir from my chair. I believe Edmee\nreally was asleep this time. When the bell rang for dinner her father\ncame in again to fetch me, and before leaving her room he said to her\nagain:\n\n\"Well, have you had a chat?\"\n\n\"Yes, father, dear,\" she replied, with an assurance that astounded me.\n\nMy cousin's behaviour seemed to me to prove beyond doubt that she\nhad merely been trifling with me, and that she was not afraid of my\nreproaches. And yet hope sprang up again when I remembered the strain in\nwhich she had spoken of me to Mademoiselle Leblanc. I even succeeded in\npersuading myself that she feared arousing her father's suspicions, and\nthat she was now feigning complete indifference only to draw me the more\nsurely to her arms as soon as the favourable moment had arrived. As it\nwas impossible to ascertain the truth, I resigned myself to waiting. But\ndays and nights passed without any explanation being sent, or any secret\nmessage bidding me be patient. She used to come down to the drawing-room\nfor an hour in the morning; in the evening she was present at dinner,\nand then would play piquet or chess with her father. During all this\ntime she was so well watched that I could not exchange a glance with\nher. For the rest of the day she remained in her own room--inaccessible.\nNoticing that I was chafing at the species of captivity in which I was\ncompelled to live, the chevalier frequently said to me:\n\n\"Go and have a chat with Edmee. You can go to her room and tell her that\nI sent you.\"\n\nBut it was in vain that I knocked. No doubt they had heard me coming and\nhad recognised me by my heavy shuffling step. The door was never opened\nto me. I grew desperate, furious.\n\nHere I must interrupt the account of my personal impressions to tell you\nwhat was happening at this time in the luckless Mauprat family. John and\nAntony had really managed to escape, and though a very close search\nhad been made for them, they had not as yet been captured. All their\nproperty was seized, and an order issued by the courts for the sale of\nthe Roche-Mauprat fief. As it proved, however, a sale was unnecessary.\nM. Hubert de Mauprat put an end to the proceedings by coming forward\nas purchaser. The creditors were paid off, and the title-deeds of\nRoche-Mauprat passed into his hands.\n\nThe little garrison kept by the Mauprats, made up of adventurers of the\nlowest type, had met the same fate as their masters. As I have already\nsaid, the garrison had long been reduced to a few individuals. Two\nor three of these were killed, others took to flight; one only was\ncaptured. This man was tried and made to suffer for all. A serious\nquestion arose as to whether judgment should not also be given against\nJohn and Antony de Mauprat by default. There was apparently no doubt\nthat they had fled; the pond in which Walter's body was found floating\nhad been drained, yet no traces of the bodies had been discovered. The\nchevalier, however, for the sake of the name he bore, strove to prevent\nthe disgrace of an ignominious sentence; as if such a sentence could\nhave added aught to the horror of the name of Mauprat. He brought to\nbear all M. de la Marche's influence and his own (which was very real\nin the province, especially on account of his high moral character),\nto hush up the affair, and he succeeded. As for myself, though I had\ncertainly had a hand in more than one of my uncles' robberies, there was\nno thought of discussing me even at the bar of public opinion. In\nthe storm of anger that my uncles had aroused people were pleased to\nconsider me simply as a young captive, a victim of their cruelty, and\nthoroughly well disposed towards everybody. Certainly, in his generous\ngood nature and desire to rehabilitate the family, the chevalier greatly\nexaggerated my merits, and spread a report everywhere that I was an\nangel of sweetness and intelligence.\n\nOn the day that M. Hubert became purchaser of the estate he entered\nmy room early in the morning accompanied by his daughter and the\nabbe. Showing me the documents which bore witness to his sacrifice\n(Roche-Mauprat was valued at about two hundred thousand francs), he\ndeclared that I was forthwith going to be put in possession not only\nof my share in the inheritance, which was by no means considerable, but\nalso of half the revenue of the property. At the same time, he said, the\nwhole estate, lands and produce, should be secured to me by his will\non one condition, namely, that I would consent to receive an education\nsuitable to my position.\n\nThe chevalier had made all these arrangements in the kindness of his\nheart and without ostentation, partly out of gratitude for the service\nhe knew I had rendered Edmee, and partly from family pride; but he\nhad not expected that I should prove so stubborn on the question\nof education. I cannot tell you the irritation I felt at this word\n\"condition\"; especially as I thought I detected in it signs of some plan\nthat Edmee had formed to free herself from her promise to me.\n\n\"Uncle,\" I answered, after listening to all his magnificent offers in\nabsolute silence, \"I thank you for all you wish to do for me; but it is\nnot right that I should avail myself of your kindness. I have no need of\na fortune. A man like myself wants nothing but a little bread, a gun, a\nhound, and the first inn he comes to on the edge of the wood. Since you\nare good enough to act as my guardian pay me the income on my eighth of\nthe fief and do not ask me to learn that Latin bosh. A man of birth is\nsufficiently well educated when he knows how to bring down a snipe and\nsign his name. I have no desire to be seigneur of Roche-Mauprat; it is\nenough to have been a slave there. You are most kind, and on my honour I\nlove you; but I have very little love for conditions. I have never done\nanything from interested motives. I would rather remain an ignoramus\nthan develop a pretty wit for another's dole. Moreover, I could never\nconsent to make such a hole in my cousin's fortune; though I know\nperfectly well that she would willingly sacrifice a part of her dowry to\nobtain release from . . .\"\n\nEdmee, who until now had remained very pale and apparently heedless of\nmy words, all at once cast a lightning glance at me and said with an air\nof unconcern:\n\n\"To obtain a release from what, may I ask, Bernard?\"\n\nI saw that, in spite of this show of courage, she was very much\nperturbed; for she broke her fan while shutting it. I answered her\nwith a look in which the artless malice of the rustic must have been\napparent:\n\n\"To obtain release, cousin, from a certain promise you made me at\nRoche-Mauprat.\"\n\nShe grew paler than ever, and on her face I could see an expression of\nterror, but ill-disguised by a smile of contempt.\n\n\"What was the promise you made him, Edmee?\" asked the chevalier, turning\ntowards her ingenuously.\n\nAt the same time the abbe pressed my arm furtively, and I understood\nthat my cousin's confessor was in possession of the secret.\n\nI shrugged my shoulders; their fears did me an injustice, though they\nroused my pity.\n\n\"She promised me,\" I replied, with a smile, \"that she would always look\nupon me as a brother and a friend. Were not those your words, Edmee, and\ndo you think it is possible to make them good by mere money?\"\n\nShe rose as if filled with new life, and, holding out her hand to me,\nsaid in a voice full of emotion:\n\n\"You are right, Bernard; yours is a noble heart, and I should never\nforgive myself if I doubted it for a moment.\"\n\nI caught sight of a tear on the edge of her eye-lid, and I pressed her\nhand somewhat too roughly, no doubt, for she could not restrain a little\ncry, followed, however, by a charming smile. The chevalier clasped me\nto his breast, and the abbe rocked about in his chair and exclaimed\nrepeatedly:\n\n\"How beautiful! How noble! How very beautiful! Ah,\" he added, \"that is\nsomething that cannot be learnt from books,\" turning to the chevalier.\n\"God writes his words and breathes forth his spirit upon the hearts of\nthe young.\"\n\n\"You will see,\" said the chevalier, deeply moved, \"that this Mauprat\nwill yet build up the honour of the family again. And now, my dear\nBernard, I will say no more about business. I know how I ought to act,\nand you cannot prevent me from taking such steps as I shall think fit\nto insure the rehabilitation of my name by yourself. The only true\nrehabilitation is guaranteed by your noble sentiments; but there is\nstill another which I know you will not refuse to attempt--the way\nto this lies through your talents and intelligence. You will make the\neffort out of love for us, I hope. However, we need not talk of this\nat present. I respect your proud spirit, and I gladly renew my offers\nwithout conditions. And now, abbe, I shall be glad if you will accompany\nme to the town to see my lawyer. The carriage is waiting. As for you,\nchildren, you can have lunch together. Come, Bernard, offer your arm to\nyour cousin, or rather, to your sister. You must acquire some courtesy\nof manner, since in her case it will be but the expression of your\nheart.\"\n\n\"That is true, uncle,\" I answered, taking hold of Edmee's arm somewhat\nroughly to lead her downstairs.\n\nI could feel her trembling; but the pink had returned to her cheeks, and\na smile of affection was playing about her lips.\n\nAs soon as we were seated opposite each other at table our happy harmony\nwas chilled in a very few moments. We both returned to our former\nstate of embarrassment. Had we been alone I should have got out of the\ndifficulty by one of those abrupt sallies which I knew how to force from\nmyself when I grew too much ashamed of my bashfulness; but the presence\nof Saint-Jean, who was waiting upon us, condemned me to silence on the\nsubject next to my heart. I decided, therefore, to talk about Patience.\nI asked her how it came to pass that she was on such good terms with\nhim, and in what light I ought to look upon the pretended sorcerer. She\ngave me the main points in the history of the rustic philosopher, and\nexplained that it was the Abbe Aubert who had taken her to Gazeau Tower.\nShe had been much struck by the intelligence and wisdom of the stoic\nhermit, and used to derive great pleasure from conversation with him. On\nhis side, Patience had conceived such a friendship for her that for some\ntime he had relaxed his strict habits, and would frequently pay her a\nvisit when he came to see the abbe.\n\nAs you may imagine, she had no little difficulty in making these\nexplanations intelligible to me. I was very much surprised at the\npraise she bestowed on Patience, and at the sympathy she showed for\nhis revolutionary ideas. This was the first time I had heard a peasant\nspoken of as a man. Besides, I had hitherto looked upon the sorcerer of\nGazeau Tower as very much below the ordinary peasant, and here was Edmee\npraising him above most of the men she knew, and even siding with him\nagainst the nobles. From this I drew the comfortable conclusion that\neducation was not so essential as the chevalier and the abbe would have\nme believe.\n\n\"I can scarcely read any better than Patience,\" I added, \"and I only\nwish you found as much pleasure in my society as in his; but it hardly\nappears so, cousin, for since I came here . . .\"\n\nWe were then leaving the table, and I was rejoicing at the prospect of\nbeing alone with her at last, so that I might talk more freely, when on\ngoing into the drawing-room we found M. de la Marche there. He had just\narrived, and was in the act of entering by the opposite door. In my\nheart I wished him at the devil.\n\nM. de la March was one of the fashionable young nobles of the day.\nSmitten with the new philosophy, devoted to Voltaire, a great admirer of\nFranklin, more well-meaning than intelligent, understanding the oracles\nless than he desired or pretended to understand them; a pretty poor\nlogician, since he found his ideas much less excellent and his political\nhopes much less sweet on the day that the French nation took it into its\nhead to realize them; for the rest, full of fine sentiments, believing\nhimself much more sanguine and romantic than he was in reality; rather\nmore faithful to the prejudices of caste and considerably more sensitive\nto the opinion of the world than he flattered and prided himself on\nbeing--such was the man. His face was certainly handsome, but I found it\nexcessively dull; for I had conceived the most ridiculous animosity for\nhim. His polished manners seemed to me abjectly servile with Edmee. I\nshould have blushed to imitate them, and yet my sole aim was to surpass\nhim in the little services he rendered her. We went out into the park.\nThis was very large, and through it ran the Indre, here merely a pretty\nstream. During our walk he made himself agreeable in a thousand ways;\nnot a violet did he see but he must pluck it to offer to my cousin.\nBut, when we arrived at the banks of the stream, we found that the plank\nwhich usually enabled one to cross at this particular spot had been\nbroken and washed away by the storms of a few days before. Without\nasking permission, I immediately took Edmee in my arms, and quietly\nwalked through the stream. The water came up to my waist, but I carried\nmy cousin at arm's length so securely and skilfully that she did not wet\na single ribbon. M. de la Marche, unwilling to appear more delicate than\nmyself, did not hesitate to wet his fine clothes and follow me, though\nwith some rather poor efforts the while to force a laugh. However,\nthough he had not any burden to carry, he several times stumbled over\nthe stones which covered the bed of the river, and rejoined us only with\ngreat difficulty. Edmee was far from laughing. I believe that this proof\nof my strength and daring, forced on her in spite of herself, terrified\nher as an evidence of the love she had stirred in me. She even appeared\nto be annoyed; and, as I set her down gently on the bank, said:\n\n\"Bernard, I must request you never to play such a prank again.\"\n\n\"That is all very well,\" I said; \"you would not be angry if it were the\nother fellow.\"\n\n\"He would not think of doing such a thing,\" she replied.\n\n\"I quite believe it,\" I answered; \"he would take very good care of that.\nJust look at the chap. . . . And I--I did not ruffle a hair of your\nhead. He is very good at picking violets; but, take my word for it, in a\ncase of danger, don't make him your first choice.\"\n\nM. de la Marche paid me great compliments on this exploit. I had hoped\nthat he would be jealous; he did not even appear to dream of it, but\nrather made merry over the pitiable state of his toilet. The day was\nexcessively hot, and we were quite dry before the end of the walk.\nEdmee, however, remained sad and pensive. It seemed to me that she was\nmaking an effort to show me as much friendship as at luncheon. This\naffected me considerably; for I was not only enamoured of her--I loved\nher. I could not make the distinction then, but both feelings were in\nme--passion and tenderness.\n\nThe chevalier and the abbe returned in time for dinner. They conversed\nin a low voice with M. de la Marche about the settlement of my affairs,\nand, from the few words which I could not help overhearing, I gathered\nthat they had just secured my future on the bright lines they had laid\nbefore me in the morning. I was too shy and proud to express my simple\nthanks. This generosity perplexed me; I could not understand it, and I\nalmost suspected that it was a trap they were preparing to separate me\nfrom my cousin. I did not realize the advantage of a fortune. Mine were\nnot the wants of a civilized being; and the prejudices of rank were with\nme a point of honour, and by no means a social vanity. Seeing that they\ndid not speak to me openly, I played the somewhat ungracious part of\nfeigning complete ignorance.\n\nEdmee grew more and more melancholy. I noticed that her eyes rested now\non M. de la Marche, now on her father, with a vague uneasiness. Whenever\nI spoke to her, or even raised my voice in addressing others, she would\nstart and then knit her brows slightly, as if my voice had caused her\nphysical pain. She retired immediately after dinner. Her father followed\nher with evident anxiety.\n\n\"Have you not noticed,\" said the abbe, turning to M. de la Marche, as\nsoon as they had left the room, \"that Mademoiselle de Mauprat has very\nmuch changed of late?\"\n\n\"She has grown thinner,\" answered the lieutenant-general; \"but in my\nopinion she is only the more beautiful for that.\"\n\n\"Yes; but I fear she may be more seriously ill than she owns,\" replied\nthe abbe. \"Her temperament seems no less changed than her face; she has\ngrown quite sad.\"\n\n\"Sad? Why, I don't think I ever saw her so gay as she was this morning;\ndon't you agree with me, Monsieur Bernard? It was only after our walk\nthat she complained of a slight headache.\"\n\n\"I assure you that she is really sad,\" rejoined the abbe. \"Nowadays,\nwhen she is gay, her gaiety is excessive; at such a time there seems to\nbe something strange and forced about her which is quite foreign to\nher usual manner. Then the next minute she relapses into a state of\nmelancholy, which I never noticed before the famous night in the forest.\nYou may be certain that night was a terrible experience.\"\n\n\"True, she was obliged to witness a frightful scene at Gazeau Tower,\"\nsaid M. de la Marche; \"and then she must have been very much exhausted\nand frightened when her horse bolted from the field and galloped right\nthrough the forest. Yet her pluck is so remarkable that . . . What do\nyou think, my dear Monsieur Bernard? When you met her in the forest, did\nshe seem very frightened?\"\n\n\"In the forest?\" I said. \"I did not meet her in the forest at all.\"\n\n\"No; it was in Varenne that you met her, wasn't it?\"\n\nThe abbe hastened to intervene. . . . \"By-the-bye, Monsieur Bernard, can\nyou spare me a minute to talk over a little matter connected with your\nproperty at . . .\"\n\nHereupon he drew me out of the drawing-room, and said in a low voice:\n\n\"There is no question of business; I only want to beg of you not to let\na single soul, not even M. de la Marche, suspect that Mademoiselle de\nMauprat was at Roche-Mauprat for the fraction of a second.\"\n\n\"And why?\" I asked. \"Was she not under my protection there? Did she\nnot leave it pure, thanks to me? Must it not be well known to the\nneighbourhood that she passed two hours there?\"\n\n\"At present no one knows,\" he answered. \"At the very moment she left it,\nRoche-Mauprat fell before the attack of the police, and not one of its\ninmates will return from the grave or from exile to proclaim the fact.\nWhen you know the world better, you will understand how important it\nis for the reputation of a young lady that none should have reason\nto suppose that even a shadow of danger has fallen upon her honour.\nMeanwhile, I implore you, in the name of her father, in the name of\nthe affection for her which you expressed this morning in so noble and\ntouching a manner . . .\"\n\n\"You are very clever, Monsieur l'Abbe,\" I said, interrupting him. \"All\nyour words have a hidden meaning which I can grasp perfectly well,\nclown as I am. Tell my cousin that she may set her mind at ease. I have\nnothing to say against her virtue, that is very certain; and I trust\nI am not capable of spoiling the marriage she desires. Tell her that I\nclaim but one thing of her, the fulfilment of that promise of friendship\nwhich she made me at Roche-Mauprat.\"\n\n\"In your eyes, then, that promise has a peculiar solemnity?\" said the\nabbe. \"If so, what grounds for distrusting it have you?\"\n\nI looked at him fixedly, and as he appeared very much agitated, I took\na pleasure in keeping him on the rack, hoping that he would repeat my\nwords to Edmee.\n\n\"None,\" I answered. \"Only I observe that you are afraid that M. de\nla Marche may break off the marriage, if he happens to hear of the\nadventure at Roche-Mauprat. If the gentleman is capable of suspecting\nEdmee, and of grossly insulting her on the eve of his wedding, it seems\nto me that there is one very simple means of mending matters.\"\n\n\"What would you suggest?\"\n\n\"Why, to challenge him and kill him.\"\n\n\"I trust you will do all you can to spare the venerable M. Hubert the\nnecessity of facing such a hideous danger.\"\n\n\"I will spare him this and many others by taking upon myself to avenge\nmy cousin. In truth, this is my right, Monsieur l'Abbe. I know the\nduties of a gentleman quite as well as if I had learnt Latin. You may\ntell her this from me. Let her sleep in peace. I will keep silence, and\nif that is useless I will fight.\"\n\n\"But, Bernard,\" replied the abbe in a gentle, insinuating tone, \"have\nyou thought of your cousin's affection for M. de la Marche?\"\n\n\"All the more reason that I should fight him,\" I cried, in a fit of\nanger.\n\nAnd I turned my back on him abruptly.\n\nThe abbe retailed the whole of our conversation to the penitent. The\npart that the worthy priest had to play was very embarrassing. Under the\nseal of confession he had been intrusted with a secret to which in his\nconversations with me he could make only indirect allusions, to bring\nme to understand that my pertinacity was a crime, and that the only\nhonourable course was to yield. He hoped too much of me. Virtue such as\nthis was beyond my power, and equally beyond my understanding.\n\n\n\n\nX\n\nA few days passed in apparent calm. Edmee said she was unwell, and\nrarely quitted her room. M. de la Marche called nearly every day,\nhis chateau being only a short distance off. My dislike for him grew\nstronger and stronger in spite of all the politeness he showed me.\nI understood nothing whatever of his dabblings in philosophy, and I\nopposed all his opinions with the grossest prejudices and expressions at\nmy command. What consoled me in a measure for my secret sufferings was\nto see that he was no more admitted than myself to Edmee's rooms.\n\nFor a week the sole event of note was that Patience took up his abode\nin a hut near the chateau. Ever since the Abbe Aubert had found a refuge\nfrom ecclesiastical persecution under the chevalier's roof, he had no\nlonger been obliged to arrange secret meetings with the hermit. He had,\ntherefore, strongly urged him to give up his dwelling in the forest\nand to come nearer to himself. Patience had needed a great deal of\npersuasion. Long years of solitude had so attached him to his Gazeau\nTower that he hesitated to desert it for the society of his friend.\nBesides, he declared that the abbe would assuredly be corrupted with\ncommerce with the great; that soon, unknown to himself, he would come\nunder the influence of the old ideas, and that his zeal for the sacred\ncause would grow cold. It is true that Edmee had won Patience's heart,\nand that, in offering him a little cottage belonging to her father\nsituated in a picturesque ravine near the park gate, she had gone to\nwork with such grace and delicacy that not even his techy pride could\nfeel wounded. In fact, it was to conclude these important negotiations\nthat the abbe had betaken himself to Gazeau Tower with Marcasse on that\nvery evening when Edmee and myself sought shelter there. The terrible\nscene which followed our arrival put an end to any irresolution still\nleft in Patience. Inclined to the Pythagorean doctrines, he had a horror\nof all bloodshed. The death of a deer drew tears from him, as from\nShakespeare's Jacques; still less could he bear to contemplate the\nmurder of a human being, and the instant that Gazeau Tower had served\nas the scene of two tragic deaths, it stood defiled in his eyes, and\nnothing could have induced him to pass another night there. He followed\nus to Sainte-Severe, and soon allowed his philosophical scruples to be\novercome by Edmee's persuasive powers. The little cottage which he was\nprevailed on to accept was humble enough not to make him blush with\nshame at a too palpable compromise with civilization; and, though the\nsolitude he found there was less perfect than at Gazeau Tower, the\nfrequent visits of the abbe and of Edmee could hardly have given him a\nright to complain.\n\n\nHere the narrator interrupted his story again to expatiate on the\ndevelopment of Mademoiselle de Mauprat's character.\n\n\nEdmee, hidden away in her modest obscurity, was--and, believe me, I\ndo not speak from bias--one of the most perfect women to be found in\nFrance. Had she desired or been compelled to make herself known to the\nworld, she would assuredly have been famous and extolled beyond all her\nsex. But she found her happiness in her own family, and the sweetest\nsimplicity crowned her mental powers and lofty virtues. She was ignorant\nof her worth, as I myself was at that time, when, brutelike, I saw only\nwith the eyes of the body, and believed I loved her only because she was\nbeautiful. It should be said, too, that her _fiance_, M. de la Marche,\nunderstood her but little better. He had developed the weakly mind with\nwhich he was endowed in the frigid school of Voltaire and Helvetius.\nEdmee had fired her vast intellect with the burning declamations of Jean\nJacques. A day came when I could understand her--the day when M. de la\nMarche could have understood her would never have come.\n\nEdmee, deprived of her mother from the very cradle, and left to her\nyoung devices by a father full of confidence and careless good nature,\nhad shaped her character almost alone. The Abbe Aubert, who had\nconfirmed her, had by no means forbidden her to read the philosophers by\nwhom he himself had been lured from the paths of orthodoxy. Finding no\none to oppose her ideas or even to discuss them--for her father, who\nidolized her, allowed himself to be led wherever she wished--Edmee\nhad drawn support from two sources apparently very antagonistic:\nthe philosophy which was preparing the downfall of Christianity, and\nChristianity which was proscribing the spirit of inquiry. To account\nfor this contradiction, you must recall what I told you about the\neffect produced on the Abbe Aubert by the _Profession de Foi du Vicaire\nSavoyard_. Moreover, you must be aware that, in poetic souls, mysticism\nand doubt often reign side by side. Jean Jacques himself furnishes a\nstriking example of this, and you know what sympathies he stirred among\npriests and nobles, even when he was chastising them so unmercifully.\nWhat miracles may not conviction work when helped by sublime eloquence!\nEdmee had drunk of this living fount with all the eagerness of an ardent\nsoul. In her rare visits to Paris she had sought for spirits in sympathy\nwith her own. There, however, she had found so many shades of opinion,\nso little harmony, and--despite the prevailing fashion--so many\nineradicable prejudices, that she had returned with a yet deeper love to\nher solitude and her poetic reveries under the old oaks in the park. She\nwould even then speak of her illusions, and--with a good sense beyond\nher years, perhaps, too, beyond her sex--she refused all opportunities\nof direct intercourse with the philosophers whose writings made up her\nintellectual life.\n\n\"I am somewhat of a Sybarite,\" she would say with a smile. \"I would\nrather have a bouquet of roses arranged for me in a vase in the early\nmorning, than go and gather them myself from out their thorns in the\nheat of the sun.\"\n\nAs a fact, this remark about her sybaritism was only a jest. Brought up\nin the country, she was strong, active, brave, and full of life. To\nall her charms of delicate beauty she united the energy of physical and\nmoral health. She was the proud-spirited and fearless girl, no less than\nthe sweet and affable mistress of the house. I often found her haughty\nand disdainful. Patience and the poor of the district never found her\nanything but modest and good-natured.\n\nEdmee loved the poets almost as much as the transcendental philosophers.\nIn her walks she always carried a book in her hand. One day when she had\ntaken Tasso with her she met Patience, who, as was his wont, inquired\nminutely into both author and subject. Edmee thereupon had to give him\nan account of the Crusades. This was not the most difficult part of her\ntask. Thanks to the stores of information derived from the abbe and to\nhis prodigious memory for facts, Patience had a passable knowledge of\nthe outlines of universal history. But what he had great trouble in\ngrasping was the connection and difference between epic poetry and\nhistory. At first he was indignant at the inventions of the poets, and\ndeclared that such impostures ought never to have been allowed. Then,\nwhen he had realized that epic poetry, far from leading generations\ninto error, only raised heroic deeds to vaster proportions and a more\nenduring glory, he asked how it was that all important events had not\nbeen sung by the bards, and why the history of man had not been embodied\nin a popular form capable of impressing itself on every mind without\nthe help of letters. He begged Edmee to explain to him a stanza of\n_Jerusalem Delivered_. As he took a fancy to it, she read him a canto\nin French. A few days later she read him another, and soon Patience knew\nthe whole poem. He rejoiced to hear that the heroic tale was popular in\nItaly; and, bringing together his recollections of it, endeavoured\nto give them an abridged form in rude prose, but he had no memory for\nwords. Roused by his vivid impressions, he would call up a thousand\nmighty images before his eyes. He would give utterance to them in\nimprovisations wherein his genius triumphed over the uncouthness of his\nlanguage, but he could never repeat what he had once said. One would\nhave had to take it down from his dictation, and even that would have\nbeen of no use to him; for, supposing he had managed to read it, his\nmemory, accustomed to occupy itself solely with thoughts, had never been\nable to retain any fragment whatever in its precise words. And yet he\nwas fond of quoting, and at times his language was almost biblical.\nBeyond, however, certain expressions that he loved, and a number of\nshort sentences that he found means to make his own, he remembered\nnothing of the pages which had been read to him so often, and he always\nlistened to them again with the same emotion as at first. It was a\nveritable pleasure to watch the effect of beautiful poetry on this\npowerful intellect. Little by little the abbe, Edmee, and subsequently\nI myself, managed to familiarize him with Homer and Dante. He was so\nstruck by the various incidents in the _Divine Comedy_ that he could\ngive an analysis of the poem from beginning to end, without forgetting\nor misplacing the slightest detail in the journey, the encounters, and\nthe emotions of the poet. There, however, his power ended. If he essayed\nto repeat some of the phrases which had so charmed him when they were\nread, he flung forth a mass of metaphors and images which savoured of\ndelirium. This initiation into the wonders of poetry marked an epoch\nin the life of Patience. In the realm of fancy it supplied the action\nwanting to his real life. In his magic mirror he beheld gigantic combats\nbetween heroes ten cubits high; he understood love, which he himself had\nnever known; he fought, he loved, he conquered; he enlightened nations,\ngave peace to the world, redressed the wrongs of mankind, and raised\nup temples to the mighty spirit of the universe. He saw in the starry\nfirmament all the gods of Olympus, the fathers of primitive humanity. In\nthe constellations he read the story of the golden age, and of the ages\nof brass; in the winter wind he heard the songs of Morven, and in the\nstorm-clouds he bowed to the ghosts of Fingal and Comala.\n\n\"Before I knew the poets,\" he said towards the end of his life, \"I was\na man lacking in one of the senses. I could see plainly that this\nsense was necessary, since there were so many things calling for its\noperation. In my solitary walks at night I used to feel a strange\nuneasiness; I used to wonder why I could not sleep; why I should find\nsuch pleasure in gazing upon the stars that I could not tear myself from\ntheir presence; why my heart should suddenly beat with joy on seeing\ncertain colours, or grow sad even to tears on hearing certain sounds.\nAt times I was so alarmed on comparing my continual agitation with the\nindifference of other men of my class that I even began to imagine that\nI was mad. But I soon consoled myself with the reflection that such\nmadness was sweet, and I would rather have ceased to exist than be cured\nof it. Now that I know these things have been thought beautiful in all\ntimes and by all intelligent beings, I understand what they are, and how\nthey are useful to man. I find joy in the thought that there is not a\nflower, not a colour, not a breath of air, which has not absorbed the\nminds and stirred the hearts of other men till it has received a name\nsacred among all peoples. Since I have learnt that it is allowed to man,\nwithout degrading his reason, to people the universe and interpret it by\nhis dreams, I live wholly in the contemplation of the universe; and\nwhen the sight of the misery and crime in the world bruises my heart\nand shakes my reason, I fall back upon my dreams. I say to myself that,\nsince all men are united in their love of the works of God, some day\nthey will also be united in their love of one another. I imagine that\neducation grows more and more perfect from father to son. It may be that\nI am the first untutored man who has divined truths of which no glimpse\nwas given him from without. It may be, too, that many others before\nmyself have been perplexed by the workings of their hearts and brains\nand have died without ever finding an answer to the riddle.\" \"Ah, we poor\nfolk,\" added Patience, \"we are never forbidden excess in labour, or in\nwine, or in any of the debauches which may destroy our minds. There are\nsome people who pay dearly for the work of our arms, so that the poor,\nin their eagerness to satisfy the wants of their families, may work\nbeyond their strength. There are taverns and other places more dangerous\nstill, from which, so it is said, the government draws a good profit;\nand there are priests, too, who get up in their pulpits to tell us what\nwe owe to the lord of our village, but never what the lord owes to us.\nNowhere is there a school where they teach us our real rights; where\nthey show us how to distinguish our true and decent wants from the\nshameful and fatal ones; where, in short, they tell us what we can and\nought to think about when we have borne the burden and heat of the day\nfor the profit of others, and are sitting in the evening at the door of\nour huts, gazing on the red stars as they come out on the horizon.\"\n\nThus would Patience reason; and, believe me, in translating his words\ninto our conventional language, I am robbing them of all their grace,\nall their fire, and all their vigour. But who could repeat the exact\nwords of Patience? His was a language used by none but himself; it was a\nmixture of the limited, though forcible, vocabulary of the peasants and\nof the boldest metaphors of the poets, whose poetic turns he would often\nmake bolder still. To this mixed idiom his sympathetic mind gave order\nand logic. An incredible wealth of thought made up for the brevity of\nthe phrases that clothed it. You should have seen how desperately his\nwill and convictions strove to overcome the impotence of his language;\nany other than he would have failed to come out of the struggle with\nhonour. And I assure you that any one capable of something more serious\nthan laughing at his solecisms and audacities of phrase, would have\nfound in this man material for the most important studies on the\ndevelopment of the human mind, and an incentive to the most tender\nadmiration for primitive moral beauty.\n\nWhen, subsequently, I came to understand Patience thoroughly, I found a\nbond of sympathy with him in my own exceptional destiny. Like him, I\nhad been without education; like him, I had sought outside myself for\nan explanation of my being--just as one seeks the answer to a riddle.\nThanks to the accidents of my birth and fortune, I had arrived at\ncomplete development, while Patience, to the hour of his death, remained\ngroping in the darkness of an ignorance from which he neither would nor\ncould emerge. To me, however, this was only an additional reason for\nrecognising the superiority of that powerful nature which held its\ncourse more boldly by the feeble light of instinct, than I myself by all\nthe brilliant lights of knowledge; and which, moreover, had not had a\nsingle evil inclination to subdue, while I had had all that a man may\nhave.\n\nAt the time, however, at which I must take up my story, Patience was\nstill, in my eyes, merely a grotesque character, an object of amusement\nfor Edmee, and of kindly compassion for the Abbe Aubert. When they spoke\nto me about him in a serious tone, I no longer understood them, and I\nimagined they took this subject as a sort of text whereon to build a\nparable proving to me the advantages of education, the necessity of\ndevoting myself to study early in life, and the futility of regrets in\nafter years.\n\nYet this did not prevent me from prowling about the copses about his new\nabode, for I had seen Edmee crossing the park in that direction, and I\nhoped that if I took her by surprise as she was returning, I should get\na conversation with her. But she was always accompanied by the abbe,\nand sometimes even by her father, and if she remained alone with the\nold peasant, he would escort her to the chateau afterwards. Frequently\nI have concealed myself in the foliage of a giant yew-tree, which spread\nout its monstrous shoots and drooping branches to within a few yards of\nthe cottage, and have seen Edmee sitting at the door with a book in her\nhand while Patience was listening with his arms folded and his head sunk\non his breast, as though he were overwhelmed by the effort of attention.\nAt that time I imagined that Edmee was trying to teach him to read, and\nthought her mad to persist in attempting an impossible education. But\nhow beautiful she seemed in the light of the setting sun, beneath the\nyellowing vine leaves that overhung the cottage door! I used to gaze on\nher and tell myself that she belonged to me, and vow never to yield to\nany force or persuasion which should endeavour to make me renounce my\nclaim.\n\nFor some days my agony of mind had been intense. My only method of\nescaping from it had been to drink heavily at supper, so that I might be\nalmost stupefied at the hour, for me so painful and so galling, when she\nwould leave the drawing-room after kissing her father, giving her\nhand to M. de la Marche, and saying as she passed by me, \"Good-night,\nBernard,\" in a tone which seemed to say, \"To-day has ended like\nyesterday, and to-morrow will end like to-day.\"\n\nIn vain would I go and sit in the arm-chair nearest her door, so that\nshe could not pass without at least her dress brushing against me; this\nwas all I ever got from her. I would not put out my hand to beg her\nown, for she might have given it with an air of unconcern, and I verily\nbelieve I should have crushed it in my anger.\n\nThanks to my large libations at supper, I generally succeeded in\nbesotting myself, silently and sadly. I then used to sink into my\nfavourite arm-chair and remain there, sullen and drowsy, until the fumes\nof the wine had passed away, and I could go and air my wild dreams and\nsinister plans in the park.\n\nNone seemed to notice this gross habit of mine. They showed me such\nkindness and indulgence in the family that they seemed afraid to express\ndisapproval, however much I deserved it. Nevertheless, they were well\naware of my shameful passion for wine, and the abbe informed Edmee of\nit. One evening at supper she looked at me fixedly several times and\nwith a strange expression. I stared at her in return, hoping that\nshe would say something to provoke me, but we got no further than an\nexchange of malevolent glances. On leaving the table she whispered to me\nvery quickly, and in an imperious tone:\n\n\"Break yourself of this drinking, and pay attention to what the abbe has\nto say to you.\"\n\nThis order and tone of authority, so far from filling me with hope,\nseemed to me so revolting that all my timidity vanished in a moment. I\nwaited for the hour when she usually went up to her room and, going out\na little before her, took up my position on the stairs.\n\n\"Do you think,\" I said to her when she appeared, \"that I am the dupe of\nyour lies, and that I have not seen perfectly, during the month I have\nbeen here, without your speaking a word to me, that you are merely\nfooling me, as if I were a booby? You lied to me and now you despise me\nbecause I was honest enough to believe your word.\"\n\n\"Bernard,\" she said, in a cold tone, \"this is neither the time nor the\nplace for an explanation.\"\n\n\"Oh, I know well enough,\" I replied, \"that, according to you, it will\nnever be the time or the place. But I shall manage to find both, do not\nfear. You said that you loved me. You threw your arms about my neck\nand said, as you kissed me--yes, here, I can still feel your lips on my\ncheeks: 'Save me, and I swear on the gospel, on my honour, by the memory\nof my mother and your own, that I will be yours.' I can see through it;\nyou said that because you were afraid that I should use my strength, and\nnow you avoid me because you are afraid I shall claim my right. But\nyou will gain nothing by it. I swear that you shall not trifle with me\nlong.\"\n\n\"I will never be yours,\" she replied, with a coldness which was becoming\nmore and more icy, \"if you do not make some change in your language,\nand manners, and feelings. In your present state I certainly do not fear\nyou. When you appeared to me good and generous, I might have yielded to\nyou, half from fear and half from affection. But from the moment I cease\nto care for you, I also cease to be afraid of you. Improve your manners,\nimprove your mind, and we will see.\"\n\n\"Very good,\" I said, \"that is a promise I can understand. I will act on\nit, and if I cannot be happy, I will have my revenge.\"\n\n\"Take your revenge as much as you please,\" she said. \"That will only\nmake me despise you.\"\n\nSo saying, she drew from her bosom a piece of paper, and burnt it in the\nflame of her candle.\n\n\"What are you doing?\" I exclaimed.\n\n\"I am burning a letter I had written to you,\" she answered. \"I wanted\nto make you listen to reason, but it is quite useless; one cannot reason\nwith brutes.\"\n\n\"Give me that letter at once,\" I cried, rushing at her to seize the\nburning paper.\n\nBut she withdrew it quickly and, fearlessly extinguishing it in her\nhand, threw the candle at my feet and fled in the darkness. I ran after\nher, but in vain. She was in her room before I could get there, and\nhad slammed the door and drawn the bolts. I could hear the voice of\nMademoiselle Leblanc asking her young mistress the cause of her fright.\n\n\"It is nothing,\" replied Edmee's trembling voice, \"nothing but a joke.\"\n\nI went into the garden, and strode up and down the walks at a furious\nrate. My anger gave place to the most profound melancholy. Edmee, proud\nand daring, seemed to me more desirable than ever. It is the nature of\nall desire to be excited and nourished by opposition. I felt that I had\noffended her, and that she did not love me, that perhaps she would never\nlove me; and, without abandoning my criminal resolution to make her mine\nby force, I gave way to grief at the thought of her hatred of me. I\nwent and leaned upon a gloomy old wall which happened to be near, and,\nburying my face in my hands, I broke into heart-rending sobs. My sturdy\nbreast heaved convulsively, but tears would not bring the relief I\nlonged for. I could have roared in my anguish, and I had to bite my\nhandkerchief to prevent myself from yielding to the temptation. The\nweird noise of my stifled sobs attracted the attention of some one who\nwas praying in the little chapel on the other side of the wall which I\nhad chanced to lean against. A Gothic window, with its stone mullions\nsurmounted by a trefoil, was exactly on a level with my head.\n\n\"Who is there?\" asked some one, and I could distinguish a pale face in\nthe slanting rays of the moon which was just rising.\n\nIt was Edmee. On recognising her I was about to move away, but she\npassed her beautiful arm between the mullions, and held me back by the\ncollar of my jacket, saying:\n\n\"Why are you crying, Bernard?\"\n\nI yielded to her gentle violence, half ashamed at having betrayed my\nweakness, and half enchanted at finding that Edmee was not unmoved by\nit.\n\n\"What are you grieved at?\" she continued. \"What can draw such bitter\ntears from you?\"\n\n\"You despise me; you hate me; and you ask why I am in pain, why I am\nangry!\"\n\n\"It is anger, then, that makes you weep?\" she said, drawing back her\narm.\n\n\"Yes; anger or something else,\" I replied.\n\n\"But what else?\" she asked.\n\n\"I can't say; probably grief, as you suggest. The truth is my life here\nis unbearable; my heart is breaking. I must leave you, Edmee, and go and\nlive in the middle of the woods. I cannot stay here any longer.\"\n\n\"Why is life unbearable? Explain yourself, Bernard. Now is our\nopportunity for an explanation.\"\n\n\"Yes, with a wall between us. I can understand that you are not afraid\nof me now.\"\n\n\"And yet it seems to me that I am only showing an interest in you; and\nwas I not as affectionate an hour ago when there was no wall between\nus?\"\n\n\"I begin to see why you are fearless, Edmee; you always find some means\nof avoiding people, or of winning them over with pretty words. Ah, they\nwere right when they told me that all women are false, and that I must\nlove none of them.\"\n\n\"And who told you that? Your Uncle John, I suppose, or your Uncle\nWalter; or was it your grandfather, Tristan?\"\n\n\"You can jeer--jeer at me as much as you like. It is not my fault that\nI was brought up by them. There were times, however, when they spoke the\ntruth.\"\n\n\"Bernard, would you like me to tell you why they thought women false?\"\n\n\"Yes, tell me.\"\n\n\"Because they were brutes and tyrants to creatures weaker than\nthemselves. Whenever one makes one's self feared one runs the risk of\nbeing deceived. In your childhood, when John used to beat you, did you\nnever try to escape his brutal punishment by disguising your little\nfaults?\"\n\n\"I did; that was my only resource.\"\n\n\"You can understand, then, that deception is, if not the right, at least\nthe resource of the oppressed.\"\n\n\"I understand that I love you, and in that at any rate there can be no\nexcuse for your deceiving me.\"\n\n\"And who says that I have deceived you?\"\n\n\"But you have; you said you loved me; you did not love me.\"\n\n\"I loved you, because at a time when you were wavering between\ndetestable principles and the impulses of a generous heart I saw that\nyou were inclining towards justice and honesty. And I love you now,\nbecause I see that you are triumphing over these vile principles, and\nthat your evil inspirations are followed by tears of honest regret. This\nI say before God, with my hand on my heart, at a time when I can see\nyour real self. There are other times when you appear to me so below\nyourself that I no longer recognise you and I think I no longer love\nyou. It rests with you, Bernard, to free me from all doubts, either\nabout you or myself.\"\n\n\"And what must I do?\"\n\n\"You must amend your bad habits, open your ears to good counsel and\nyour heart to the precepts of morality. You are a savage, Bernard; and,\nbelieve me, it is neither your awkwardness in making a bow, nor your\ninability to turn a compliment that shocks me. On the contrary, this\nroughness of manner would be a very great charm in my eyes, if only\nthere were some great ideas and noble feelings beneath it. But your\nideas and your feelings are like your manners, that is what I cannot\nendure. I know it is not your fault, and if I only saw you resolute\nto improve I should love you as much for your defects as for your\nqualities. Compassion brings affection in its train. But I do not love\nevil, I never loved it; and, if you cultivate it in yourself instead of\nuprooting it, I can never love you. Do you understand me?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"What, no!\"\n\n\"No, I say. I am not aware that there is any evil in me. If you are not\ndispleased at the lack of grace in my legs, or the lack of whiteness in\nmy hands, or the lack of elegance in my words, I fail to see what you\nfind to hate in me. From my childhood I have had to listen to evil\nprecepts, but I have not accepted them. I have never considered it\npermissible to do a bad deed; or, at least, I have never found it\npleasurable. If I have done wrong, it is because I have been forced to\ndo it. I have always detested my uncles and their ways. I do not like to\nsee others suffer; I do not rob a fellow-creature; I despise money, of\nwhich they made a god at Roche-Mauprat; I know how to keep sober, and,\nthough I am fond of wine, I would drink water all my life if, like my\nuncles, I had to shed blood to get a good supper. Yet I fought for them;\nyet I drank with them. How could I do otherwise? But now, when I am my\nown master, what harm am I doing? Does your abbe, who is always prating\nof virtue, take me for a murderer or a thief? Come, Edmee, confess now;\nyou know well enough that I am an honest man; you do not really think\nme wicked; but I am displeasing to you because I am not clever, and you\nlike M. de la Marche because he has a knack of making unmeaning speeches\nwhich I should blush to utter.\"\n\n\"And if, to be pleasing to me,\" she said with a smile, after listening\nmost attentively, and without withdrawing her hand which I had taken\nthrough the bars, \"if, in order to be preferred to M. de la Marche, it\nwere necessary to acquire more wit, as you say, would you not try?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" I replied, after hesitating a moment; \"perhaps I should\nbe fool enough; for the power you have over me is more than I can\nunderstand; but it would be a sorry piece of cowardice and a great\nfolly.\"\n\n\"Why, Bernard?\"\n\n\"Because a woman who could love a man, not for his honest heart, but for\nhis pretty wit, would be hardly worth the pains I should have to take;\nat least so it seems to me.\"\n\nShe remained silent in her turn, and then said to me as she pressed my\nhand:\n\n\"You have much more sense and wit than one might think. And since you\nforce me to be quite frank with you, I will own that, as you now are and\neven should you never change, I have an esteem and an affection for\nyou which will last as long as my life. Rest assured of that, Bernard,\nwhatever I may say in a moment of anger. You know I have a quick\ntemper--that runs in the family. The blood of the Mauprats will never\nflow as smoothly as other people's. Have a care for my pride, then, you\nknow so well what pride is, and do not ever presume upon rights you\nhave acquired. Affection cannot be commanded; it must be implored or\ninspired. Act so that I may always love you; never tell me that I am\nforced to love you.\"\n\n\"That is reasonable enough,\" I answered; \"but why do you sometimes speak\nto me as if I were forced to obey you? Why, for instance, this evening\ndid you _forbid_ me to drink and _order_ me to study?\"\n\n\"Because if one cannot command affection which does not exist, one can\nat least command affection which does exist; and it is because I am sure\nyours exists that I commanded it.\"\n\n\"Good!\" I cried, in a transport of joy; \"I have a right then to order\nyours also, since you have told me that it certainly exists. . . .\nEdmee, I order you to kiss me.\"\n\n\"Let go, Bernard!\" she cried; \"you are breaking my arm. Look, you have\nscraped it against the bars.\"\n\n\"Why have you intrenched yourself against me?\" I said, putting my lips\nto the little scratch I had made on her arm. \"Ah, woe is me! Confound\nthe bars! Edmee, if you would only bend your head down I should be able\nto kiss you . . . kiss you as my sister. Edmee, what are you afraid of?\"\n\n\"My good Bernard,\" she replied, \"in the world in which I live one does\nnot kiss even a sister, and nowhere does one kiss in secret. I will kiss\nyou every day before my father, if you like; but never here.\"\n\n\"You will never kiss me!\" I cried, relapsing into my usual passion.\n\"What of your promise? What of my rights?\"\n\n\"If we marry,\" she said, in an embarrassed tone, \"when you have received\nthe education I implore you to receive, . . .\"\n\n\"Death of my life! Is this a jest? Is there any question of marriage\nbetween us? None at all. I don't want your fortune, as I have told you.\"\n\n\"My fortune and yours are one,\" she replied. \"Bernard, between near\nrelations as we are, mine and thine are words without meaning. I should\nnever suspect you of being mercenary. I know that you love me, that you\nwill work to give me proof of this, and that a day will come when your\nlove will no longer make me fear, because I shall be able to accept it\nin the face of heaven and earth.\"\n\n\"If that is your idea,\" I replied, completely drawn away from my wild\npassion by the new turn she was giving to my thoughts, \"my position is\nvery different; but, to tell you the truth, I must reflect on this; I\nhad not realized that this was your meaning.\"\n\n\"And how should I have meant otherwise?\" she answered. \"Is not a woman\ndishonoured by giving herself to a man who is not her husband? I do not\nwish to dishonour myself; and, since you love me, you would not wish\nit either. You would not do me an irreparable wrong. If such were your\nintention you would be my deadliest enemy.\"\n\n\"Stay, Edmee, stay!\" I answered. \"I can tell you nothing about my\nintentions in regard to you, for I have never had any very definite.\nI have felt nothing but wild desires, nor have I ever thought of you\nwithout going mad. You wish me to marry you? But why--why?\"\n\n\"Because a girl who respects herself cannot be any man's except with the\nthought, with the intention, with the certainty of being his forever. Do\nyou not know that?\"\n\n\"There are so many things I do not know or have never thought of.\"\n\n\"Education will teach you, Bernard, what you ought to think about the\nthings which must concern you--about your position, your duties, your\nfeelings. At present you see but dimly into your heart and conscience.\nAnd I, who am accustomed to question myself on all subjects and to\ndiscipline my life, how can I take for master a man governed by instinct\nand guided by chance?\"\n\n\"For master! For husband! Yes, I understand that you cannot surrender\nyour whole life to an animal such as myself . . . but that is what I\nhave never asked of you. No, I tremble to think of it.\"\n\n\"And yet, Bernard, you must think of it. Think of it frequently, and\nwhen you have done so you will realize the necessity of following my\nadvice, and of bringing your mind into harmony with the new life upon\nwhich you have entered since quitting Roche-Mauprat. When you have\nperceived this necessity you must tell me, and then we will make several\nnecessary resolutions.\"\n\nShe withdrew her hand from mine quickly, and I fancy she bade me\ngood-night; but this I did not hear. I stood buried in my thoughts, and\nwhen I raised my head to speak to her she was no longer there. I went\ninto the chapel, but she had returned to her room by an upper gallery\nwhich communicated with her apartments.\n\nI went back into the garden, walked far into the park, and remained\nthere all night. This conversation with Edmee had opened a new world\nto me. Hitherto I had not ceased to be the Roche-Mauprat man, nor had I\never contemplated that it was possible or desirable to cease to be so.\nExcept for some habits which had changed with circumstances, I had never\nmoved out of the narrow circle of my old thoughts. I felt annoyed that\nthese new surroundings of mine should have any real power over me, and\nI secretly braced my will so that I should not be humbled. Such was my\nperseverance and strength of character that I believed nothing would\never have driven me from my intrenchment of obstinacy, had not Edmee's\ninfluence been brought to bear upon me. The vulgar comforts of life, the\nsatisfactions of luxury, had no attraction for me beyond their novelty.\nBodily repose was a burden to me, and the calm that reigned in this\nhouse, so full of order and silence, would have been unbearable, had\nnot Edmee's presence and the tumult of my own desires communicated to it\nsome of my disorder, and peopled it with some of my visions. Never for\na single moment had I desired to become the head of this house, the\npossessor of this property; and it was with genuine pleasure that I\nhad just heard Edmee do justice to my disinterestedness. The thought of\ncoupling two ends so entirely distinct as my passion and my interests\nwas still more repugnant to me. I roamed about the park a prey to a\nthousand doubts, and then wandered into the open country unconsciously.\nIt was a glorious night. The full moon was pouring down floods of soft\nlight upon the ploughed lands, all parched by the heat of the sun.\nThirsty plants were straightening their bowed stems--each leaf seemed\nto be drinking in through all its pores all the dewy freshness of the\nnight. I, too, began to feel a soothing influence at work. My heart was\nstill beating violently, but regularly. I was filled with a vague hope;\nthe image of Edmee floated before me on the paths through the meadows,\nand no longer stirred the wild agonies and frenzied desires which had\nbeen devouring me since the night I first beheld her.\n\nI was crossing a spot where the green stretches of pasture were here and\nthere broken by clumps of young trees. Huge oxen with almost white skins\nwere lying in the short grass, motionless, as if plunged in peaceful\nthought. Hills sloped gently up to the horizon, and their velvety\ncontours seemed to ripple in the bright rays of the moon. For the first\ntime in my life I realized something of the voluptuous beauty and divine\neffluence of the night. I felt the magic touch of some unknown bliss.\nIt seemed that for the first time in my life I was looking on moon and\nmeadows and hills. I remembered hearing Edmee say that nothing our eyes\ncan behold is more lovely than Nature; and I was astonished that I had\nnever felt this before. Now and them I was on the point of throwing\nmyself on my knees and praying to God: but I feared that I should not\nknow how to speak to Him, and that I might offend Him by praying badly.\nShall I confess to you a singular fancy that came upon me, a childish\nrevelation, as it were, of poetic love from out of the chaos of my\nignorance? The moon was lighting up everything so plainly that I could\ndistinguish the tiniest flowers in the grass. A little meadow daisy\nseemed to me so beautiful with its golden calyx full of diamonds of\ndew and its white collaret fringed with purple, that I plucked it, and\ncovered it with kisses, and cried in a sort of delirious intoxication:\n\n\"It is you, Edmee! Yes, it is you! Ah, you no longer shun me!\"\n\nBut what was my confusion when, on rising, I found there had been a\nwitness of my folly. Patience was standing before me.\n\nI was so angry at having been surprised in such a fit of extravagance\nthat, from a remnant of the Hamstringer instinct, I immediately felt\nfor a knife in my belt; but neither belt nor knife was there. My silk\nwaistcoat with its pocket reminded me that I was doomed to cut no more\nthroats. Patience smiled.\n\n\"Well, well! What is the matter?\" said the anchorite, in a calm and\nkindly tone. \"Do you imagine that I don't know perfectly well how things\nstand? I am not so simple but that I can reason; I am not so old but\nthat I can see. Who is it that makes the branches of my yew shake\nwhenever the holy maiden is sitting at my door? Who is it that follows\nus like a young wolf with measured steps through the copse when I take\nthe lovely child to her father? And what harm is there in it? You are\nboth young; you are both handsome; you are of the same family; and, if\nyou chose, you might become a noble and honest man as she is a noble and\nhonest girl.\"\n\nAll my wrath had vanished as I listened to Patience speaking of Edmee.\nI had such a vast longing to talk about her that I would even have\nbeen willing to have heard evil spoken of her, for the sole pleasure\nof hearing her name pronounced. I continued my walk by the side of\nPatience. The old man was tramping through the dew with bare feet. It\nshould be mentioned, however, that his feet had long been unacquainted\nwith any covering and had attained a degree of callosity that rendered\nthem proof against anything. His only garments were a pair of blue\ncanvas breeches which, in the absence of braces, hung loosely from his\nhips, and a coarse shirt. He could not endure any constraint in his\nclothes; and his skin, hardened by exposure, was sensitive to neither\nheat nor cold. Even when over eighty he was accustomed to go bareheaded\nin the broiling sun and with half-open shirt in the winter blasts.\nSince Edmee had seen to his wants he had attained a certain cleanliness.\nNevertheless, in the disorder of his toilet and his hatred of everything\nthat passed the bounds of the strictest necessity (though he could not\nhave been charged with immodesty, which had always been odious to him),\nthe cynic of the old days was still apparent. His beard was shining like\nsilver. His bald skull was so polished that the moon was reflected in\nit as in water. He walked slowly, with his hands behind his back and his\nhead raised, like a man who is surveying his empire. But most frequently\nhis glances were thrown skywards, and he interrupted his conversation to\npoint to the starry vault and exclaim:\n\n\"Look at that; look how beautiful it is!\"\n\nHe is the only peasant I have ever known to admire the sky; or, at\nleast, he is the only one I have ever seen who was conscious of his\nadmiration.\n\n\"Why, Master Patience,\" I said to him, \"do you think I might be an\nhonest man if I chose? Do you think that I am not one already?\"\n\n\"Oh, do not be angry,\" he answered. \"Patience is privileged to say\nanything. Is he not the fool of the chateau?\"\n\n\"On the contrary, Edmee maintains that you are its sage.\"\n\n\"Does the holy child of God say that? Well, if she believes so, I will\ntry to act as a wise man, and give you some good advice, Master Bernard\nMauprat. Will you accept it?\"\n\n\"It seems to me that in this place every one takes upon himself to give\nadvice. Never mind, I am listening.\"\n\n\"You are in love with your cousin, are you not?\"\n\n\"You are very bold to ask such a question.\"\n\n\"It is not a question, it is a fact. Well, my advice is this: make your\ncousin love you, and become her husband.\"\n\n\"And why do you take this interest in me, Master Patience?\"\n\n\"Because I know you deserve it.\"\n\n\"Who told you so? The abbe?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Edmee?\"\n\n\"Partly. And yet she is certainly not very much in love with you. But it\nis your own fault.\"\n\n\"How so, Patience?\"\n\n\"Because she wants you to become clever; and you--you would rather not.\nOh, if I were only your age; yes, I, poor Patience; and if I were able,\nwithout feeling stifled, to shut myself up in a room for only two hours\na day; and if all those I met were anxious to teach me; if they said to\nme, 'Patience, this is what was done yesterday; Patience, this is what\nwill be done to-morrow.' But, enough! I have to find out everything\nmyself, and there is so much that I shall die of old age before finding\nout a tenth part of what I should like to know. But, listen: I have yet\nanother reason for wishing you to marry Edmee.\"\n\n\"What is that, good Monsieur Patience?\"\n\n\"This La Marche is not the right man for her. I have told her so--yes,\nI have; and himself too, and the abbe, and everybody. He is not a man,\nthat thing. He smells as sweet as a whole flower-garden; but I prefer\nthe tiniest sprig of wild thyme.\"\n\n\"Faith! I have but little love for him myself. But if my cousin likes\nhim, what then, Patience?\"\n\n\"Your cousin does not like him. She thinks he is a good man; she thinks\nhim genuine. She is mistaken; he deceives her, as he deceives everybody.\nYes, I know: he is a man who has not any of this (and Patience put his\nhand to his heart). He is a man who is always proclaiming: 'In me behold\nthe champion of virtue, the champion of the unfortunate, the champion\nof all the wise men and friends of the human race, etc., etc.' While\nI--Patience--I know that he lets poor folk die of hunger at the gates\nof his chateau. I know that if any one said to him, 'Give up your castle\nand eat black bread, give up your lands and become a soldier, and then\nthere will be no more misery in the world, the human race--as you call\nit--will be saved,' his real self would answer, 'Thanks, I am lord of\nmy lands, and I am not yet tired of my castle.' Oh! I know them so well,\nthese sham paragons. How different with Edmee! You do not know that. You\nlove her because she is as beautiful as the daisy in the meadows, while\nI--I love her because she is good as the moon that sheds light on all.\nShe is a girl who gives away everything that she has; who would not wear\na jewel, because with the gold in a ring a man could be kept alive for a\nyear. And if she finds a foot-sore child by the road-side, she takes off\nher shoes and gives them to him, and goes on her way bare-footed. Then,\nlook you, hers is a heart that never swerves. If to-morrow the village\nof Saint-Severe were to go to her in a body and say: 'Young lady, you\nhave lived long enough in the lap of wealth, give us what you have, and\ntake your turn at work'--'That is but fair, my good friends,' she would\nreply, and with a glad heart she would go and tend the flocks in the\nfields. Her mother was the same. I knew her mother when she was quite\nyoung, young as yourself; and I knew yours too. Oh, yes. She was a lady\nwith a noble mind, charitable and just to all. And you take after her,\nthey say.\"\n\n\"Alas, no,\" I answered, deeply touched by these words of Patience. \"I\nknow neither charity nor justice.\"\n\n\"You have not been able to practise them yet, but they are written in\nyour heart. I can read them there. People call me a sorcerer, and so I\nam in a measure. I know a man directly I see him. Do you remember what\nyou said to me one day on the heath at Valide? You were with Sylvain\nand I with Marcasse. You told me that an honest man avenges his wrongs\nhimself. And, by-the-bye, Monsieur Mauprat, if you are not satisfied\nwith the apologies I made you at Gazeau Tower, you may say so. See,\nthere is no one near; and, old as I am, I have still a fist as good as\nyours. We can exchange a few healthy blows--that is Nature's way. And,\nthough I do not approve of it, I never refuse satisfaction to any\none who demands it. There are some men, I know, who would die of\nmortification if they did not have their revenge: and it has taken\nme--yes, the man you see before you--more than fifty years to forget an\ninsult I once received . . . and even now, whenever I think of it, my\nhatred of the nobles springs up again, and I hold it as a crime to have\nlet my heart forgive some of them.\"\n\n\"I am fully satisfied, Master Patience; and in truth I now feel nothing\nbut affection for you.\"\n\n\"Ah, that comes of my scratching your back. Youth is ever generous.\nCome, Mauprat, take courage. Follow the abbe's advice; he is a good\nman. Try to please your cousin; she is a star in the firmament. Find out\ntruth; love the people; hate those who hate them; be ready to sacrifice\nyourself for them. . . . Yes, one word more--listen. I know what I am\nsaying--become the people's friend.\"\n\n\"Is the people, then, better than the nobility, Patience? Come now,\nhonestly, since you are a wise man, tell me the truth.\"\n\n\"Ay, we are worth more than the nobles, because they trample us under\nfoot, and we let them. But we shall not always bear this, perhaps. No;\nyou will have to know it sooner or later, and I may as well tell you\nnow. You see yonder stars? They will never change. Ten thousand years\nhence they will be in the same place and be giving forth as much light\nas to-day; but within the next hundred years, maybe within less, there\nwill be many a change on this earth. Take the word of a man who has an\neye for the truth of things, and does not let himself be led astray by\nthe fine airs of the great. The poor have suffered enough; they will\nturn upon the rich, and their castles will fail and their lands be\ncarved up. I shall not see it; but you will. There will be ten cottages\nin the place of this park, and ten families will live on its revenue.\nThere will no longer be servants or masters, or villein or lord. Some\nnobles will cry aloud and yield only to force, as your uncles would do\nif they were alive, and as M. de la Marche will do in spite of all his\nfine talk. Others will sacrifice themselves generously, like Edmee, and\nlike yourself, if you listen to wisdom. And in that hour it will be well\nfor Edmee that her husband is a man and not a mere fop. It will be well\nfor Bernard Mauprat that he knows how to drive a plough or kill the game\nwhich the good God has sent to feed his family; for old Patience will\nthen be lying under the grass in the churchyard, unable to return the\nservices which Edmee has done him. Do not laugh at what I say, young\nman; it is the voice of God that is speaking. Look at the heavens. The\nstars live in peace, and nothing disturbs their eternal order. The\ngreat do not devour the small, and none fling themselves upon their\nneighbours. Now, a day will come when the same order will reign among\nmen. The wicked will be swept away by the breath of the Lord. Strengthen\nyour legs, Seigneur Mauprat, that you may stand firm to support Edmee.\nIt is Patience that warns you; Patience who wishes you naught but good.\nBut there will come others who wish you ill, and the good must make\nthemselves strong.\"\n\nWe had reached Patience's cottage. He had stopped at the gate of his\nlittle inclosure, resting one hand on the cross-bar and waving the other\nas he spoke. His voice was full of passion, his eyes flashed fire, and\nhis brow was bathed in sweat. There seemed to be some weird power in\nhis words as in those of the prophets of old. The more than plebeian\nsimplicity of his dress still further increased the pride of his\ngestures and the impressiveness of his voice. The French Revolution\nhas shown since that in the ranks of the people there was no lack of\neloquence or of pitiless logic; but what I saw at that moment was so\nnovel, and made such an impression on me, that my unruly and unbridled\nimagination was carried away by the superstitious terrors of childhood.\nHe held out his hand, and I responded with more of terror than\naffection. The sorcerer of Gazeau Tower hanging the bleeding owl above\nmy head had just risen before my eyes again.\n\n\n\n\nXI\n\nWhen I awoke on the morrow in a state of exhaustion, all the incidents\nof the previous night appeared to me as a dream. I began to think that\nEdmee's suggestion of becoming my wife had been a perfidious trick to\nput off my hopes indefinitely; and, as to the sorcerer's words, I could\nnot recall them without a feeling of profound humiliation. Still, they\nhad produced their effect. My emotions had left traces which could never\nbe effaced. I was no longer the man of the day before, and never again\nwas I to be quite the man of Roche-Mauprat.\n\nIt was late, for not until morning had I attempted to make good my\nsleepless night. I was still in bed when I heard the hoofs of M. de la\nMarche's horse on the stones of the courtyard. Every day he used to come\nat this hour; every day he used to see Edmee at the same time as myself;\nand now, on this very day, this day when she had tried to persuade me to\nreckon on her hand, he was going to see her before me, and to give his\nsoulless kiss to this hand that had been promised to myself. The\nthought of it stirred up all my doubts again. How could Edmee endure his\nattentions if she really meant to marry another man? Perhaps she dared\nnot send him away; perhaps it was my duty to do so. I was ignorant of\nthe ways of the world into which I was entering. Instinct counselled me\nto yield to my hasty impulses; and instinct spoke loudly.\n\nI hastily dressed myself. I entered the drawing-room pale and agitated.\nEdmee was pale too. It was a cold, rainy morning. A fire was burning in\nthe great fire-place. Lying back in an easy chair, she was warming\nher little feet and dozing. It was the same listless, almost lifeless,\nattitude of the days of her illness. M. de la Marche was reading the\npaper at the other end of the room. On seeing that Edmee was more\naffected than myself by the emotions of the previous night, I felt my\nanger cool, and, approaching her noiselessly, I sat down and gazed on\nher tenderly.\n\n\"Is that you, Bernard?\" she asked without moving a limb, and with eyes\nstill closed.\n\nHer elbows were resting on the arms of her chair and her hands were\ngracefully crossed under her chin. At that period it was the fashion\nfor women to have their arms half bare at all times. On one of Edmee's I\nnoticed a little strip of court-plaster that made my heart beat. It was\nthe slight scratch I had caused against the bars of the chapel window. I\ngently lifted the lace which fell over her elbow, and, emboldened by her\ndrowsiness, pressed my lips to the darling wound. M. de la Marche could\nsee me, and, in fact, did see me, as I intended he should. I was\nburning to have a quarrel with him. Edmee started and turned red; but\nimmediately assuming an air of indolent playfulness, she said:\n\n\"Really, Bernard, you are as gallant this morning as a court abbe. Do\nyou happen to have been composing a madrigal last night?\"\n\nI was peculiarly mortified at this jesting. However, paying her back in\nher own coin, I answered:\n\n\"Yes; I composed one yesterday evening at the chapel window; and if it\nis a poor thing, cousin, it is your fault.\"\n\n\"Say, rather, that it is the fault of your education,\" she replied,\nkindling.\n\nAnd she was never more beautiful than when her natural pride and spirit\nwere roused.\n\n\"My own opinion is that I am being very much over-educated,\" I answered;\n\"and that if I gave more heed to my natural good sense you would not\njeer at me so much.\"\n\n\"Really, it seems to me that you are indulging in a veritable war of\nwits with Bernard,\" said M. de la Marche, folding his paper carelessly\nand approaching us.\n\n\"I cry quits with her,\" I answered, annoyed at this impertinence. \"Let\nher keep her wit for such as you.\"\n\nI had risen to insult him, but he did not seem to notice it; and\nstanding with his back to the fire he bent down towards Edmee and said,\nin a gentle and almost affectionate voice:\n\n\"What is the matter with him?\" as if he were inquiring after the health\nof her little dog.\n\n\"How should I know?\" she replied, in the same tone.\n\nThen she rose and added:\n\n\"My head aches too much to remain here. Give me your arm and take me up\nto my room.\"\n\nShe went out, leaning upon his arm. I was left there stupefied.\n\nI remained in the drawing-room, resolved to insult him as soon as he\nshould return. But the abbe now entered, and soon afterward my Uncle\nHubert. They began to talk on subjects which were quite strange to me\n(the subjects of their conversation were nearly always so). I did not\nknow what to do to obtain revenge. I dared not betray myself in my\nuncle's presence. I was sensible to the respect I owed to him and to his\nhospitality. Never had I done such violence to myself at Roche-Mauprat.\nYet, in spite of all efforts, my anger showed itself. I almost died at\nbeing obliged to wait for revenge. Several times the chevalier noticed\nthe change in my features and asked in a kind tone if I were ill. M.\nde la Marche seemed neither to observe nor to guess anything. The abbe\nalone examined me attentively. More than once I caught his blue eyes\nanxiously fixed on me, those eyes in which natural penetration was\nalways veiled by habitual shyness. The abbe did not like me. I could\neasily see that his kindly, cheerful manners grew cold in spite of\nhimself as soon as he spoke to me; and I noticed, too, that his face\nwould invariably assume a sad expression at my approach.\n\nThe constraint that I was enduring was so alien to my habits and so\nbeyond my strength that I came nigh to fainting. To obtain relief I went\nand threw myself on the grass in the park. This was a refuge to me in\nall my troubles. These mighty oaks, this moss which had clung to their\nbranches through the centuries, these pale, sweet-scented wild flowers,\nemblems of secret sorrow, these were the friends of my childhood, and\nthese alone I had found the same in social as in savage life. I buried\nmy face in my hands; and I never remember having suffered more in any of\nthe calamities of my life, though some that I had to bear afterward\nwere very real. On the whole I ought to have accounted myself lucky, on\ngiving up the rough and perilous trade of a cut-throat, to find so many\nunexpected blessings--affection, devotion, riches, liberty, education,\ngood precepts and good examples. But it is certain that, in order to\npass from a given state to its opposite, though it be from evil to\ngood, from grief to joy, from fatigue to repose, the soul of a man must\nsuffer; in this hour of birth of a new destiny all the springs of his\nbeing are strained almost to breaking--even as at the approach of summer\nthe sky is covered with dark clouds, and the earth, all a-tremble, seems\nabout to be annihilated by the tempest.\n\nAt this moment my only thought was to devise some means of appeasing my\nhatred of M. de la Marche without betraying and without even arousing\na suspicion of the mysterious bond which held Edmee in my power. Though\nnothing was less respected at Roche-Mauprat than the sanctity of an\noath, yet the little reading I had had there--those ballads of chivalry\nof which I have already spoken--had filled me with an almost romantic\nlove of good faith; and this was about the only virtue I had acquired\nthere. My promise of secrecy to Edmee was therefore inviolable in my\neyes.\n\n\"However,\" I said to myself, \"I dare say I shall find some plausible\npretext for throwing myself upon my enemy and strangling him.\"\n\nTo confess the truth, this was far from easy with a man who seemed bent\non being all politeness and kindness.\n\nDistracted by these thoughts, I forgot the dinner hour; and when I saw\nthe sun sinking behind the turrets of the castle I realized too late\nthat my absence must have been noticed, and that I could not appear\nwithout submitting to Edmee's searching questions, and to the abbe's\ncold, piercing gaze, which, though it always seemed to avoid mine, I\nwould suddenly surprise in the act of sounding the very depths of my\nconscience.\n\nI resolved not to return to the house till nightfall, and I threw myself\nupon the grass and tried to find rest for my aching head in sleep. I did\nfall asleep in fact. When I awoke the moon was rising in the heavens,\nwhich were still red with the glow of sunset. The noise which had\naroused me was very slight; but there are some sounds which strike the\nheart before reaching the ear; and the subtlest emanations of love will\nat times pierce through the coarsest organization. Edmee's voice had\njust pronounced my name a short distance away, behind some foliage. At\nfirst I thought I had been dreaming; I remained where I was, held my\nbreath and listened. It was she, on her way to the hermit's, in company\nwith the abbe. They had stopped in a covered walk five or six yards from\nme, and they were talking in low voices, but in those clear tones which,\nin an exchange of confidence, compels attention with peculiar solemnity.\n\n\"I fear,\" Edmee was saying, \"that there will be trouble between him and\nM. de la Marche; perhaps something very serious--who knows? You do not\nunderstand Bernard.\"\n\n\"He must be got away from here, at all costs,\" answered the abbe. \"You\ncannot live in this way, continually exposed to the brutality of a\nbrigand.\"\n\n\"It cannot be called living. Since he set foot in the house I have not\nhad a moment's peace of mind. Imprisoned in my room, or forced to seek\nthe protection of my friends, I am almost afraid to move. It is as much\nas I dare to do to creep downstairs, and I never cross the corridor\nwithout sending Leblanc ahead as a scout. The poor woman, who has always\nfound me so brave, now thinks I am mad. The suspense is horrible. I\ncannot sleep unless I first bolt the door. And look, abbe, I never walk\nabout without a dagger, like the heroine of a Spanish ballad, neither\nmore nor less.\"\n\n\"And if this wretch meets you and frightens you, you will plunge it\ninto your bosom? Oh! that must not be. Edmee, we must find some means\nof changing a position which is no longer tenable. I take it that you do\nnot wish to deprive him of your father's friendship by confessing to the\nlatter the monstrous bargain you were forced to make with this bandit at\nRoche-Mauprat. But whatever may happen--ah! my poor little Edmee, I am\nnot a bloodthirsty man, but twenty times a day I find myself deploring\nthat my character of priest prevents me from challenging this creature,\nand ridding you of him forever.\"\n\nThis charitable regret, expressed so artlessly in my very ear, made me\nitch to reveal myself to them at once, were it only to put the abbe's\nwarlike humour to the proof; but I was restrained by the hope that I\nshould at last discover Edmee's real feelings and real intentions in\nregard to myself.\n\n\"Have no fear,\" she said, in a careless tone. \"If he tries my patience\ntoo much, I shall not have the slightest hesitation in planting this\nblade in his cheek. I am quite sure that a little blood-letting will\ncool his ardour.\"\n\nThen they drew a few steps nearer.\n\n\"Listen to me, Edmee,\" said the abbe, stopping again. \"We cannot discuss\nthis matter with Patience. Let us come to some decision before we put it\naside. Your relations with Bernard are now drawing to a crisis. It seems\nto me, my child, that you are not doing all you ought to ward off the\nevils that may strike us; for everything that is painful to you will be\npainful to all of us, and will touch us to the bottom of our hearts.\"\n\n\"I am all attention, excellent friend,\" answered Edmee; \"scold me,\nadvise me, as you will.\"\n\nSo saying she leant back against the tree at the foot of which I was\nlying among the brushwood and long grass. I fancy she might have seen\nme, for I could see her distinctly. However, she little thought that I\nwas gazing on her divine face, over which the night breeze was throwing,\nnow the shadows of the rustling leaves, and now the pale diamonds that\nthe moon showers down through the trees of the forest.\n\n\"My opinion, Edmee,\" answered the abbe, crossing his arms on his breast\nand striking his brow at intervals, \"is that you do not take the right\nview of your situation. At times it distresses you to such an extent\nthat you lose all hope and long to die--yes, my dear child, to such\nan extent that your health plainly suffers. At other times, and I must\nspeak candidly at the risk of offending you a little, you view your\nperils with a levity and cheerfulness that astound me.\"\n\n\"That last reproach is delicately put, dear friend,\" she replied; \"but\nallow me to justify myself. Your astonishment arises from the fact that\nyou do not know the Mauprat race. It is a tameless, incorrigible race,\nfrom which naught but Headbreakers and Hamstringers may issue. Even\nin those who have been most polished by education there remains many a\nstubborn knot--a sovereign pride, a will of iron, a profound contempt\nfor life. Look at my father. In spite of his adorable goodness, you see\nthat he is sometimes so quick-tempered that he will smash his snuff-box\non the table, when you get the better of him in some political argument,\nor when you win a game of chess. For myself, I am conscious that my\nveins are as full-blooded as if I had been born in the noble ranks of\nthe people; and I do not believe that any Mauprat has ever shone at\ncourt for the charm of his manners. Since I was born brave, how would\nyou have me set much store by life? And yet there are weak moments in\nwhich I get discouraged more than enough, and bemoan my fate like the\ntrue woman that I am. But, let some one offend me, or threaten me, and\nthe blood of the strong surges through me again; and then, as I cannot\ncrush my enemy, I fold my arms and smile with compassion at the idea\nthat he should ever have hoped to frighten me. And do not look upon this\nas mere bombast, abbe. To-morrow, this evening perhaps, my words may\nturn to deeds. This little pearl-handled knife does not look like deeds\nof blood; still, it will be able to do its work, and ever since Don\nMarcasse (who knows what he is about) sharpened it, I have had it by me\nnight and day, and my mind is made up. I have not a very strong fist,\nbut it will no doubt manage to give myself a good stab with this knife,\neven as it manages to give my horse a cut with the whip. Well, that\nbeing so, my honour is safe; it is only my life, which hangs by a\nthread, which is at the mercy of a glass of wine, more or less, that\nM. Bernard may happen to drink one of these evenings; of some change\nmeeting, or some exchange of looks between De la Marche and myself that\nhe may fancy he has detected; a breath of air perhaps! What is to be\ndone? Were I to grieve, would my tears wash away the past? We cannot\ntear out a single page of our lives; but we can throw the book into\nthe fire. Though I should weep from night till morn, would that prevent\nDestiny from having, in a fit of ill-humour, taken me out hunting, sent\nme astray in the woods, and made me stumble across a Mauprat, who led me\nto his den, where I escaped dishonour and perhaps death only by binding\nmy life forever to that of a savage who had none of my principles, and\nwho probably (and who undoubtedly, I should say) never will have them?\nAll this is a misfortune. I was in the full sunlight of a happy destiny;\nI was the pride and joy of my old father; I was about to marry a man\nI esteem and like; no sorrows, no fears had come near my path; I knew\nneither days fraught with danger nor nights bereft of sleep. Well, God\ndid not wish such a beautiful life to continue; His will be done. There\nare days when the ruin of all my hopes seems to me so inevitable that\nI look upon myself as dead and my _fiance_ as a widower. If it were not\nfor my poor father, I should really laugh at it all; for I am so ill\nbuilt for vexation and fears that during the short time I have known\nthem they have already tired me of life.\"\n\n\"This courage is heroic, but it is also terrible,\" cried the abbe, in a\nbroken voice. \"It is almost a resolve to commit suicide, Edmee.\"\n\n\"Oh, I shall fight for my life,\" she answered, with warmth; \"but I shall\nnot stand haggling with it a moment if my honour does not come forth\nsafe and sound from all these risks. No; I am not pious enough ever to\naccept a soiled life by way of penance for sins of which I never had a\nthought. If God deals so harshly with me that I have to choose between\nshame and death . . .\"\n\n\"There can never be any shame for you, Edmee; a soul so chaste, so pure\nin intention . . .\"\n\n\"Oh, don't talk of that, dear abbe! Perhaps I am not as good as you\nthink; I am not very orthodox in religion--nor are you, abbe! I give\nlittle heed to the world; I have no love for it. I neither fear nor\ndespise public opinion; it will never enter into my life. I am not very\nsure what principle of virtue would be strong enough to prevent me from\nfalling, if the spirit of evil took me in hand. I have read _La Nouvelle\nHeloise_, and I shed many tears over it. But, because I am a Mauprat and\nhave an unbending pride, I will never endure the tyranny of any man--the\nviolence of a lover no more than a husband's blow; only a servile soul\nand a craven character may yield to force that which it refuses to\nentreaty. Sainte Solange, the beautiful shepherdess, let her head be cut\noff rather than submit to the seigneur's rights. And you know that from\nmother to daughter the Mauprats have been consecrated in baptism to the\nprotection of the patron saint of Berry.\"\n\n\"Yes; I know that you are proud and resolute,\" said the abbe, \"and\nbecause I respect you more than any woman in the world I want you to\nlive, and be free, and make a marriage worthy of you, so that in the\nhuman family you may fill the part which beautiful souls still know how\nto make noble. Besides, you are necessary to your father; your death\nwould hurry him to his grave, hearty and robust as the Mauprat still is.\nPut away these gloomy thoughts, then, and these violent resolutions. It\nis impossible. This adventure of Roche-Mauprat must be looked upon only\nas an evil dream. We both had a nightmare in those hours of horror; but\nit is time for us to awake; we cannot remain paralyzed with fear like\nchildren. You have only one course open to you, and that I have already\npointed out.\"\n\n\"But, abbe, it is the one which I hold the most impossible of all. I\nhave sworn by everything that is most sacred in the universe and the\nhuman heart.\"\n\n\"An oath extorted by threats and violence is binding on none; even human\nlaws decree this. Divine laws, especially in a case of this nature,\nabsolve the human conscience beyond a doubt. If you were orthodox, I\nwould go to Rome--yes, I would go on foot--to get you absolved from so\nrash a vow; but you are not a submissive child of the Pope, Edmee--nor\nam I.\"\n\n\"You wish me, then, to perjure myself?\"\n\n\"Your soul would not be perjured.\"\n\n\"My soul would! I took an oath with a full knowledge of what I was doing\nand at a time when I might have killed myself on the spot; for in my\nhand I had a knife three times as large as this. But I wanted to live;\nabove all, I wanted to see my father again and kiss him. To put an end\nto the agony which my disappearance must have caused him, I would have\nbartered more than my life, I would have bartered my immortal soul.\nSince then, too, as I told you last night, I have renewed my vow, and\nof my own free-will, moreover; for there was a wall between my amiable\n_fiance_ and myself.\"\n\n\"How could you have been so imprudent, Edmee? Here again I fail to\nunderstand you.\"\n\n\"That I can quite believe, for I do not understand myself,\" said Edmee,\nwith a peculiar expression.\n\n\"My dear child, you must open your hear to me freely. I am the only\nperson here who can advise you, since I am the only one to whom you can\ntell everything under the seal of a friendship as sacred as the secrecy\nof Catholic confession can be. Answer me, then. You do not really look\nupon a marriage between yourself and Bernard Mauprat as possible?\"\n\n\"How should that which is inevitable be impossible?\" said Edmee. \"There\nis nothing more possible than throwing one's self into the river;\nnothing more possible than surrendering one's self to misery and\ndespair; nothing more possible, consequently, than marrying Bernard\nMauprat.\"\n\n\"In any case I will not be the one to celebrate such an absurd and\ndeplorable union,\" cried the abbe. \"You, the wife and the slave of this\nHamstringer! Edmee, you said just now that you would no more endure the\nviolence of a lover than a husband's blow.\"\n\n\"You think the he would beat me?\"\n\n\"If he did not kill you.\"\n\n\"Oh, no,\" she replied, in a resolute tone, with a wave of the knife, \"I\nwould kill him first. When Mauprat meets Mauprat . . .!\"\n\n\"You can laugh, Edmee? O my God! you can laugh at the thought of such\na match! But, even if this man had some affection and esteem for you,\nthink how impossible it would be for you to have anything in common;\nthink of the coarseness of his ideas, the vulgarity of his speech. The\nheart rises in disgust at the idea of such a union. Good God! In what\nlanguage would you speak to him?\"\n\nOnce more I was on the point of rising and falling on my panegyrist; but\nI overcame my rage. Edmee began to speak, and I was all ears again.\n\n\"I know very well that at the end of three or four days I should have\nnothing better to do than cut my own throat; but since sooner or later\nit must come to that, why should I not go forward to the inevitable\nhour? I confess that I shall be sorry to leave life. Not all those\nwho have been to Roche-Mauprat have returned. I went there not to meet\ndeath, but to betroth myself to it. Well, then, I will go on to my\nwedding-day, and if Bernard is too odious, I will kill myself after the\nball.\"\n\n\"Edmee, your head seems full of romantic notions at present,\" said the\nabbe, losing patience. \"Thank God, your father will never consent to\nthe marriage. He has given his word to M. de la March, and you too have\ngiven yours. This is the only promise that is valid.\"\n\n\"My father would consent--yes, with joy--to an arrangement which\nperpetuated his name and line directly. As to M. de la March, he will\nrelease me from any promise without my taking the trouble to ask him; as\nsoon as he hears that I passed two hours at Roche-Mauprat there will be\nno need of any other explanation.\"\n\n\"He would be very unworthy of the esteem I feel for him, if he\nconsidered your good name tarnished by an unfortunate adventure from\nwhich you came out pure.\"\n\n\"Thanks to Bernard,\" said Edmee; \"for after all I ought to be grateful\nto him; in spite of his reservations and conditions, he performed a\ngreat and inconceivable action, for a Hamstringer.\"\n\n\"God forbid that I should deny the good qualities which education may\nhave developed in this young man; and it may still be possible, by\napproaching him on this better side of his, to make him listen to\nreason.\"\n\n\"And make him consent to be taught? Never. Even if he should show\nhimself willing, he would no more be able than Patience. When the body\nis made for an animal life, the spirit can no longer submit to the laws\nof the intellect.\"\n\n\"I think so too; but that is not the point. I suggest that you should\nhave an explanation with him, and make him understand that he is bound\nin honour to release you from your promise and resign himself to your\nmarriage with M. de la Marche. Either he is a brute unworthy of the\nslightest esteem and consideration, or he will realize his crime and\nfolly and yield honestly and with a good grace. Free me from the vow of\nsecrecy to which I am bound; authorize me to deal plainly with him and I\nwill guarantee success.\"\n\n\"And I--I will guarantee the contrary,\" said Edmee. \"Besides, I could\nnot consent to this. Whatever Bernard may be, I am anxious to come out\nof our duel with honour; and if I acted as you suggest, he would have\ncause to believe that up to the present I have been unworthily trifling\nwith him.\"\n\n\"Well, there is only one means left, and that is to trust to the honour\nand discretion of M. de la Marche. Set before him the details of your\nposition, and then let him give the verdict. You have a perfect right to\nintrust him with your secret, and you are quite sure of his honour. If\nhe is coward enough to desert you in such a position, your remaining\nresource is to take shelter from Bernard's violence behind the iron bars\nof a convent. You can remain there a few years; you can make a show of\ntaking the veil. The young man will forget you, and they will set you\nfree again.\"\n\n\"Indeed, that is the only reasonable course to take, and I had already\nthought of it; but it is not yet time to make the move.\"\n\n\"Very true; you must first see the result of your confession to M. de la\nMarche. If, as I make no doubt, he is a man of mettle, he will take\nyou under his protection, and then procure the removal of this Bernard,\nwhether by persuasion or authority.\"\n\n\"What authority, abbe, if you please?\"\n\n\"The authority which our customs allow one gentleman to exercise over\nhis equal--honour and the sword.\"\n\n\"Oh, abbe! You too, then are a man with a thirst for blood. Well, that\nis precisely what I have hitherto tried to avoid, and what I will avoid,\nthough it cost me my life and honour. I do not wish that there should be\nany fight between these two men.\"\n\n\"I understand: one of the two is very rightly dear to you. But evidently\nin this duel it is not M. de la Marche who would be in danger.\"\n\n\"Then it would be Bernard,\" cried Edmee. \"Well, I should hate M. de la\nMarche, if he insisted on a duel with this poor boy, who only knows how\nto handle a stick or a sling. How can such ideas occur to you, abbe?\nYou must really loathe this unfortunate Bernard. And fancy me getting\nmy husband to cut his throat as a return for having saved my life at the\nrisk of his own. No, no; I will not suffer any one either to challenge\nhim, or humiliate him, or persecute him. He is my cousin; he is a\nMauprat; he is almost a brother. I will not let him be driven out of\nthis home. Rather I will go myself.\"\n\n\"These are very generous sentiments, Edmee,\" answered the abbe. \"But\nwith what warmth you express them! I stand confounded; and, if I were\nnot afraid of offending you, I should confess that this solicitude for\nyoung Mauprat suggests to me a strange thought.\"\n\n\"Well, what is it, then?\" said Edmee, with a certain brusqueness.\n\n\"If you insist, of course I will tell you: you seem to take a deeper\ninterest in this young man than in M. de la Marche, and I could have\nwished to think otherwise.\"\n\n\"Which has the greater need of this interest, you bad Christian?\" said\nEdmee with a smile. \"Is it not the hardened sinner whose eyes have never\nlooked upon the light?\"\n\n\"But, come, Edmee! You love M. de la Marche, do you not? For Heaven's\nsake do not jest.\"\n\n\"If by love,\" she replied in a serious tone, \"you mean a feeling of\ntrust and friendship, I love M. de la Marche; but if you mean a feeling\nof compassion and solicitude, I love Bernard. It remains to be seen\nwhich of these two affections is the deeper. That is your concern, abbe.\nFor my part, it troubles me but little; for I feel that there is only\none being whom I love with passion, and that is my father; and only one\nthing that I love with enthusiasm, and that is my duty. Probably I shall\nregret the attentions and devotion of the lieutenant-general, and I\nshall share in the grief that I must soon cause him when I announce that\nI can never be his wife. This necessity, however, will by no means drive\nme to desperation, because I know that M. de la Marche will quickly\nrecover. . . . I am not joking, abbe; M. de la Marche is a man of no\ndepth, and somewhat cold.\"\n\n\"If your love for him is no greater than this, so much the better. It\nmakes one trial less among your many trials. Still, this indifference\nrobs me of my last hope of seeing you rescued from Bernard Mauprat.\"\n\n\"Do not let this grieve you. Either Bernard will yield to friendship and\nloyalty and improve, or I shall escape him.\"\n\n\"But how?\"\n\n\"By the gate of the convent--or of the graveyard.\"\n\nAs she uttered these words in a calm tone, Edmee shook back her long\nblack hair, which had fallen over her shoulders and partly over her pale\nface.\n\n\"Come,\" she said, \"God will help us. It is folly and impiety to doubt\nhim in the hour of danger. Are we atheists, that we let ourselves be\ndiscouraged in this way? Let us go and see Patience. . . . He will bring\nforth some wise saw to ease our minds; he is the old oracle who solves\nall problems without understanding any.\"\n\nThey moved away, while I remained in a state of consternation.\n\nOh, how different was this night from the last! How vast a step I had\njust taken in life, no longer on the path of flowers but on the arid\nrocks! Now I understood all the odious reality of the part I had been\nplaying. In the bottom of Edmee's heart I had just read the fear and\ndisgust I inspired in her. Nothing could assuage my grief; for nothing\nnow could arouse my anger. She had no affection for M. de la Marche;\nshe was trifling neither with him nor with me; she had no affection for\neither of us. How could I have believed that her generous sympathy for\nme and her sublime devotion to her word were signs of love? How, in the\nhours when this presumptuous fancy left me, could I have believed that\nin order to resist my passion she must needs feel love for another? It\nhad come to pass, then, that I had no longer any object on which to vent\nmy rage; now it could result only in Edmee's flight or death? Her death!\nAt the mere thought of it the blood ran cold in my veins, a weight fell\non my heart, and I felt all the stings of remorse piercing it. This\nnight of agony was for me the clearest call of Providence. At last I\nunderstood those laws of modesty and sacred liberty which my ignorance\nhad hitherto outraged and blasphemed. They astonished me more than ever;\nbut I could see them; their sanction was their own existence. Edmee's\nstrong, sincere soul appeared before me like the stone of Sinai on which\nthe finger of God has traced the immutable truth. Her virtue was not\nfeigned; her knife was sharpened, ready to cut out the stain of my love.\nI was so terrified at having been in danger of seeing her die in my\narms; I was so horrified at the gross insult I had offered her while\nseeking to overcome her resistance, that I began to devise all manner of\nimpossible plans for righting the wrongs I had done, and restoring her\npeace of mind.\n\nThe only one which seemed beyond my powers was to tear myself away from\nher; for while these feelings of esteem and respect were springing up in\nme, my love was changing its nature, so to speak, and growing vaster and\ntaking possession of all my being. Edmee appeared to me in a new light.\nShe was no longer the lovely girl whose presence stirred a tumult in my\nsenses; she was a young man of my own age, beautiful as a seraph, proud,\ncourageous, inflexible in honour, generous, capable of that sublime\nfriendship which once bound together brothers in arms, but with no\npassionate love except for Deity, like the paladins of old, who, braving\na thousand dangers, marched to the Holy Land under their golden armour.\n\nFrom this hour I felt my love descending from the wild storms of the\nbrain into the healthy regions of the heart. Devotion seemed no longer\nan enigma to me. I resolved that on the very next morning I would give\nproof of my submission and affection. It was quite late when I returned\nto the chateau, tired out, dying of hunger, and exhausted by the\nemotions I had experienced. I entered the pantry, found a piece of\nbread, and began eating it, all moist with my tears. I was leaning\nagainst the stove in the dime light of a lamp that was almost out, when\nI suddenly saw Edmee enter. She took a few cherries from a chest and\nslowly approached the stove, pale and deep in thought. On seeing me she\nuttered a cry and let the cherries fall.\n\n\"Edmee,\" I said, \"I implore you never to be afraid of me again. That is\nall I can say now; for I do not know how to explain myself; and yet I\nhad resolved to say many things.\"\n\n\"You must tell me them some other time, cousin,\" she answered, trying to\nsmile.\n\nBut she was unable to disguise the fear she felt at finding herself\nalone with me.\n\nI did not try to detain her. I felt deeply pained and humiliated at her\ndistrust of me, and I knew I had no right to complain. Yet never had any\nman stood in greater need of a word of encouragement.\n\nJust as she was going out of the room I broke down altogether, and burst\ninto tears, as on the previous night at the chapel window. Edmee stopped\non the threshold and hesitated a moment. Then, yielding to the kindly\nimpulses of her heart, she overcame her fears and returned towards me.\nPausing a few yards from my chair, she said:\n\n\"Bernard, you are unhappy. Tell me; is it my fault?\"\n\nI was unable to reply; I was ashamed of my tears, but the more I tried\nto restrain them the more my breast heaved with sobs. With men as\nphysically strong as I was, tears are generally convulsions; mine were\nlike the pangs of death.\n\n\"Come now! Just tell me what is wrong,\" cried Edmee, with some of the\nbluntness of sisterly affection.\n\nAnd she ventured to put her hand on my shoulder. She was looking at me\nwith an expression of wistfulness, and a big tear was trickling down her\ncheek. I threw myself on my knees and tried to speak, but that was still\nimpossible. I could do no more than mutter the word _to-morrow_ several\ntimes.\n\n\"'To-morrow?' What of tomorrow?\" said Edmee. \"Do you not like being\nhere? Do you want to go away?\"\n\n\"I will go, if it will please you,\" I replied. \"Tell me; do you wish\nnever to see me again?\"\n\n\"I do not wish that at all,\" she rejoined. \"You will stop here, won't\nyou.\"\n\n\"It is for you to decide,\" I answered.\n\nShe looked at me in astonishment. I was still on my knees. She leant\nover the back of my chair.\n\n\"Yes; I am quite sure that you are good at heart,\" she said, as if\nshe were answering some inner objection. \"A Mauprat can be nothing by\nhalves; and as soon as you have once known a good quarter of an hour, it\nis certain you ought to have a noble life before you.\"\n\n\"I will make it so,\" I answered.\n\n\"You mean it?\" she said with unaffected joy.\n\n\"On my honour, Edmee, and on yours. Dare you give me your hand?\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" she said.\n\nShe held out her hand to me; but she was still trembling.\n\n\"You have been forming good resolutions, then?\" she said.\n\n\"I have been forming such resolutions,\" I replied, \"that you will never\nhave to reproach me again. And now, Edmee, when you return to your room,\nplease do not bolt your door any more. You need no longer be afraid of\nme. Henceforth I shall only wish what you wish.\"\n\nShe again fixed on me a look of amazement. Then, after pressing my hand,\nshe moved away, but turned round several times to look at me again, as\nif unable to believe in such a sudden conversion. At last, stopping in\nthe doorway, she said to me in an affectionate tone:\n\n\"You, too, must go and get some rest. You look tired; and for the last\ntwo days you have seemed sad and very much altered. If you do not wish\nto make me anxious, you will take care of yourself, Bernard.\"\n\nShe gave me a sweet little nod. In her big eyes, already hollowed by\nsuffering, there was an indefinable expression, in which distrust and\nhope, affection and wonder, were depicted alternately or at times all\ntogether.\n\n\"I will take care of myself; I will get some sleep; and I will not be\nsad any longer,\" I answered.\n\n\"And you will work?\"\n\n\"And I will work--but, you, Edmee, will you forgive me for all the pain\nI have caused you? and will you try to like me a little?\"\n\n\"I shall like you very much,\" she replied, \"if you are always as you are\nthis evening.\"\n\nOn the morrow, at daybreak, I went to the abbe's room. He was already up\nand reading.\n\n\"Monsieur Aubert,\" I said to him, \"you have several times offered\nto give me lessons. I now come to request you to carry out your kind\noffer.\"\n\nI had spent part of the night in preparing this opening speech and in\ndeciding how I had best comport myself in the abbe's presence. Without\nreally hating him, for I could quite see that he meant well and that he\nbore me ill-will only because of my faults, I felt very bitter towards\nhim. Inwardly I recognised that I deserved all the bad things he had\nsaid about me to Edmee; but it seemed to me that he might have insisted\nsomewhat more on the good side of mine to which he had given a merely\npassing word, and which could not have escaped the notice of a man so\nobservant as himself. I had determined, therefore, to be very cold\nand very proud in my bearing towards him. To this end I judged with a\ncertain show of logic, that I ought to display great docility as long as\nthe lesson lasted, and that immediately afterwards I ought to leave him\nwith a very curt expression of thanks. In a word, I wished to humiliate\nhim in his post of tutor; for I was not unaware that he depended for his\nlivelihood on my uncle, and that, unless he renounced this livelihood\nor showed himself ungrateful, he could not well refuse to undertake\nmy education. My reasoning here was very good; but the spirit which\nprompted it was very bad; and subsequently I felt so much regret for my\nbehaviour that I made him a sort of friendly confession with a request\nfor absolution.\n\nHowever, not to anticipate events, I will simply say that the first\nfew days after my conversation afforded me an ample revenge for the\nprejudices, too well founded in many respects, which this man had\nagainst me. He would have deserved the title of \"the just,\" assigned\nhim by Patience, had not a habit of distrust interfered with his first\nimpulses. The persecutions of which he had so long been the object had\ndeveloped in him this instinctive feeling of fear, which remained with\nhim all his life, and made trust in others always very difficult to him,\nthough all the more flattering and touching perhaps when he accorded it.\nSince then I have observed this characteristic in many worthy priests.\nThey generally have the spirit of charity, but not the feeling of\nfriendship.\n\nI wished to make him suffer, and I succeeded. Spite inspired me. I\nbehaved as a nobleman might to an inferior. I preserved an excellent\nbearing, displayed great attention, much politeness, and an icy\nstiffness. I determined to give him no chance to make me blush at\nmy ignorance, and, to this end, I acted so as to anticipate all his\nobservations by accusing myself at once of knowing nothing, and by\nrequesting him to teach me the very rudiments of things. When I had\nfinished my first lesson I saw in his penetrating eyes, into which I had\nmanaged to penetrate myself, a desire to pass from this coldness to\nsome sort of intimacy; but I carefully avoided making any response. He\nthought to disarm me by praising my attention and intelligence.\n\n\"You are troubling yourself unnecessarily, monsieur,\" I replied. \"I\nstand in no need of encouragement. I have not the least faith in my\nintelligence, but of my attention I certainly am very sure; but since\nit is solely for my own good that I am doing my best to apply myself to\nthis work, there is no reason why you should compliment me on it.\"\n\nWith these words I bowed to him and withdrew to my room, where I\nimmediately did the French exercise that he had set me.\n\nWhen I went down to luncheon, I saw that Edmee was already aware of the\nexecution of the promise I had made the previous evening. She at once\ngreeted me with outstretched hand, and frequently during luncheon called\nme her \"dear cousin,\" till at last M. de la Marche's face, which was\nusually expressionless, expressed surprise or something very near it. I\nwas hoping that he would take the opportunity to demand an explanation\nof my insulting words of the previous day; and although I had resolved\nto discuss the matter in a spirit of great moderation, I felt very much\nhurt at the care which he took to avoid it. This indifference to an\ninsult that I had offered implied a sort of contempt, which annoyed\nme very much; but the fear of displeasing Edmee gave me strength to\nrestrain myself.\n\nIncredible as it may seem, my resolve to supplant him was not for one\nmoment shaken by this humiliating apprenticeship which I had now to\nserve before I could manage to obtain the most elementary notions of\nthings in general. Any other than I, filled like myself with remorse\nfor wrongs committed, would have found no surer method of repairing them\nthan by going away, and restoring to Edmee her perfect independence and\nabsolute peace of mind. This was the only method which did not occur\nto me; or if it did, it was rejected with scorn, as a sign of apostasy.\nStubbornness, allied to temerity, ran through my veins with the blood\nof the Mauprats. No sooner had I imagined a means of winning her whom\nI loved than I embraced it with audacity; and I think it would not have\nbeen otherwise even had her confidences to the abbe in the park shown\nme that her love was given to my rival. Such assurance on the part of a\nyoung man who, at the age of seventeen, was taking his first lesson in\nFrench grammar, and who, moreover, had a very exaggerated notion of the\nlength and difficulty of the studies necessary to put him on a level\nwith M. de la March, showed, you must allow, a certain moral force.\n\nI do not know if I was happily endowed in the matter of intelligence.\nThe abbe assured me that I was; but, for my own part, I think that my\nrapid progress was due to nothing but my courage. This was such as to\nmake me presume too much on my physical powers. The abbe had told me\nthat, with a strong will, any one of my age could master all the rules\nof the language within a month. At the end of the month I expressed\nmyself with facility and wrote correctly. Edmee had a sort of occult\ninfluence over my studies; at her wish I was not taught Latin; for she\ndeclared that I was too old to devote several years to a fancy branch\nof learning, and that the essential thing was to shape my heart and\nunderstanding with ideas, rather than to adorn my mind with words.\n\nOf an evening, under pretext of wishing to read some favourite book\nagain, she read aloud, alternately with the abbe, passages from\nCondillac, Fenelon, Bernardin de Saint-Pierre, Jean Jacques, and even\nfrom Montaigne and Montesquieu. These passages, it is true, were chosen\nbeforehand and adapted to my powers. I understood them fairly well, and\nI secretly wondered at this; for if during the day I opened these same\nbooks at random, I found myself brought to a standstill at every line.\nWith the superstition natural to young lovers, I willingly imagined that\nin passing through Edmee's mouth the authors acquired a magic clearness,\nand that by some miracle my mind expanded at the sound of her voice.\nHowever, Edmee was careful to disguise the interest she took in teaching\nme herself. There is no doubt that she was mistaken in thinking that\nshe ought not to betray her solicitude: it would only have roused me to\nstill greater efforts in my work. But in this, imbued as she was with\nthe teachings of _Emile_, she was merely putting into practice the\ntheories of her favourite philosopher.\n\nAs it was, I spared myself but little; for my courage would not admit of\nany forethought. Consequently I was soon obliged to stop. The change\nof air, of diet, and of habits, my lucubrations, the want of vigorous\nexercise, my intense application, in a word, the terrible revolution\nwhich my nature had to stir up against itself in order to pass from the\nstate of a man of the woods to that of an intelligent being, brought on\na kind of brain fever which made me almost mad for some weeks, then an\nidiot for some days, and finally disappeared, leaving me a mere wreck\nphysically, with a mind completely severed from the past, but sternly\nbraced to meet the future.\n\nOne night, when I was at the most critical stage of my illness, during a\nlucid interval, I caught sight of Edmee in my room. At first I thought\nI was dreaming. The night-light was casting an unsteady glimmer over the\nroom. Near me was a pale form lying motionless on an easy chair. I could\ndistinguish some long black tresses falling loosely over a white dress.\nI sat up, weak though I was and scarcely able to move, and tried to\nget out of bed. Patience, however, suddenly appeared by the bedside and\ngently stopped me. Saint-Jean was sleeping in another arm-chair. Every\nnight there used to be two men watching me thus, ready to hold me down\nby force whenever I became violent during my delirium. Frequently the\nabbe was one; sometimes the worthy Marcasse, who, before leaving\nBerry to go on his annual round through the neighbouring province, had\nreturned to have a farewell hunt in the outhouses of the chateau, and\nwho kindly offered to relieve the servants in their painful task of\nkeeping watch over me.\n\nAs I was wholly unconscious of my illness, it was but natural that\nthe unexpected presence of the hermit in my room should cause me\nconsiderable astonishment, and throw me into a state of great agitation.\nMy attacks had been so violent that evening that I had no strength left.\nI abandoned myself, therefore, to my melancholy ravings, and, taking the\ngood man's hand, I asked him if it was really Edmee's corpse that he had\nplaced in the arm-chair by my bedside.\n\n\"It is Edmee's living self,\" he answered, in a low voice; \"but she is\nstill asleep, my dear monsieur, and we must not wake her. If there is\nanything you would like, I am here to attend to you, and right gladly I\ndo it.\"\n\n\"My good Patience, you are deceiving me,\" I said; \"she is dead, and\nso am I, and you have come to bury us. But you must put us in the same\ncoffin, do you hear? for we are betrothed. Where is her ring? Take it\noff and put it on my finger; our wedding-night has come.\"\n\nHe tried in vain to dispel this hallucination. I held to my belief that\nEdmee was dead, and declared that I should never be quiet in my shroud\nuntil I had been given my wife's ring. Edmee, who had sat up with me\nfor several nights, was so exhausted that our voices did not awaken\nher. Besides, I was speaking in a whisper, like Patience, with that\ninstinctive tendency to imitate which is met with only in children or\nidiots. I persisted in my fancy, and Patience, who was afraid that it\nmight turn into madness, went and very carefully removed a cornelian\nring from one of Edmee's fingers and put it on mine. As soon as I felt\nit there, I carried it to my lips; and then with my arms crossed on my\nbreast, in the manner of a corpse in a coffin, I fell into a deep sleep.\n\nOn the morrow when they tried to take the ring from me I resisted\nviolently, and they abandoned the attempt. I fell asleep again and the\nabbe removed it during my sleep. But when I opened my eyes I noticed the\ntheft, and once more began to rave. Edmee, who was in the room, ran\nto me at once and pressed the ring over my finger, at the same time\nrebuking the abbe. I immediately grew calm, and gazing, on her with\nlack-lustre eyes, said:\n\n\"Is it not true that you are my wife in death as in life?\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" she replied. \"Set your mind at rest.\"\n\n\"Eternity is long,\" I said, \"and I should like to spend it in recalling\nyour caresses. But I send my thoughts back in vain; they bring me no\nremembrance of your love.\"\n\nShe leant over and gave me a kiss.\n\n\"Edmee, that is very wrong,\" said the abbe; \"such remedies turn to\npoison.\"\n\n\"Let me do as I like, abbe,\" she replied, with evident impatience,\nsitting down near my bed; \"I must ask you to let me do as I please.\"\n\nI fell asleep with one of my hands in hers, repeating at intervals:\n\n\"How sweet it is in the grave! Are we not fortunate to be dead?\"\n\nDuring my convalescence Edmee was much more reserved, but no less\nattentive. I told her my dreams and learnt from her how far my\nrecollections were of real events. Without her testimony I should always\nhave believed that I had dreamt everything. I implored her to let me\nkeep the ring, and she consented. I ought to have added, to show my\ngratitude for all her goodness, that I should keep it as a pledge of\nfriendship, and not as a sign of our engagement; but such a renunciation\nwas beyond me.\n\nOne day I asked for news of M. de la Marche. It was only to Patience\nthat I dared to put this question.\n\n\"Gone,\" he answered.\n\n\"What! Gone?\" I replied. \"For long?\"\n\n\"Forever, please God! I don't know anything about it, for I ask no\nquestions; but I happened to be in the garden when he took leave of her,\nand it was all as cold as a December night. Still, _au revoir_ was\nsaid on both sides, but though Edmee's manner was kind and honest as\nit always is, the other had the face of a farmer when he sees frosts\nin April. Mauprat, Mauprat, they tell me that you have become a great\nstudent and a genuine good fellow. Remember what I told you; when you\nare old there will probably no longer be any titles or estate. Perhaps\nyou will be called 'Father' Mauprat, as I am called 'Father' Patience,\nthough I have never been either a priest or a father of a family.\"\n\n\"Well, what are you driving at?\"\n\n\"Remember what I once told you,\" he repeated. \"There are many ways of\nbeing a sorcerer, and one may read the future without being a servant\nof the devil. For my part, I give my consent to your marriage with your\ncousin. Continue to behave decently. You are a wise man now, and can\nread fluently from any book set before you. What more do you want? There\nare so many books here that the sweat runs from my brow at the very\nsight of them; it seems as if I were again starting the old torment of\nnot being able to learn to read. But you have soon cured yourself. If M.\nHubert were willing to take my advice, he would fix the wedding for the\nnext Martinmas.\"\n\n\"That is enough, Patience!\" I said. \"This is a painful subject with me;\nmy cousin does not love me.\"\n\n\"I tell you she does. You lie in your throat, as the nobles say. I know\nwell enough how she nursed you; and Marcasse from the housetop happened\nto look through her window and saw her on her knees in the middle of the\nroom at five o'clock in the morning the day that you were so ill.\"\n\nThese imprudent assertions of Patience, Edmee's tender cares, the\ndeparture of M. de la Marche, and, more than anything else, the weakness\nof my brain, enabled me to believe what I wished; but in proportion as\nI regained my strength Edmee withdrew further and further within the\nbounds of calm and discreet friendship. Never did man recover his\nhealth with less pleasure than I mine; for each day made Edmee's visits\nshorter; and when I was able to leave my room I had merely a few hours a\nday near her, as before my illness. With marvellous skill she had given\nme proof of the tenderest affection without ever allowing herself to be\ndrawn into a fresh explanation concerning our mysterious betrothal. If I\nhad not yet sufficient greatness of soul to renounce my rights, I had at\nleast developed enough honour not to refer to them; and I found myself\non exactly the same terms with her as at the time when I had fallen ill.\nM. de la Marche was in Paris; but according to her he had been summoned\nthither by his military duties and ought to return at the end of the\nwinter on which we were entering. Nothing that the chevalier or the abbe\nsaid tended to show that there had been a quarrel between Edmee and him.\nThey rarely spoke of the lieutenant-general, but when they had to speak\nof him they did so naturally and without any signs of repugnance. I\nwas again filled with my old doubts, and could find no remedy for them\nexcept in the kingdom of my own will. \"I will force her to prefer me,\" I\nwould say to myself as I raised my eyes from my book and watched Edmee's\ngreat, inscrutable eyes calmly fixed on the letters which her father\noccasionally received from M. de la Marche, and which he would hand to\nher as soon as he had read them. I buried myself in my work again. For\na long time I suffered from frightful pains in the head, but I overcame\nthem stoically. Edmee again began the course of studies which she had\nindirectly laid down for my winter evenings. Once more I astonished the\nabbe by my aptitude and the rapidity of my conquests. The kindness he\nhad shown me during my illness had disarmed me; and although I was still\nunable to feel any genuine affection for him, knowing well that he was\nof little service to me with my cousin, I gave him proof of much more\nconfidence and respect than in the past. His talks were as useful to me\nas my reading. I was allowed to accompany him in his walks in the park\nand in his philosophical visits to Patience's snow-covered hut. This\ngave me an opportunity of seeing Edmee more frequently and for longer\nperiods. My behaviour was such that all her mistrust vanished, and she\nno longer feared to be alone with me. On such occasions, however, I\nhad but little scope for displaying my heroism; for the abbe, whose\nvigilance nothing could lull to sleep, was always at our heels. This\nsupervision no longer annoyed me; on the contrary, I was pleased at it;\nfor, in spite of all my resolutions, the storms of passion would still\nsweep my senses into a mysterious disorder; and once or twice when I\nfound myself alone with Edmee I left her abruptly and went away, so that\nshe might not perceive my agitation.\n\nOur life, then, was apparently calm and peaceful, and for some time\nit was so in reality; but soon I disturbed it more than ever by a vice\nwhich education developed in me, and which had hitherto been hidden\nunder coarser but less fatal vices. This vice, the bane of my new period\nof life, was vanity.\n\nIn spite of their theories, the abbe and my cousin made the mistake\nof showing too much pleasure at my rapid progress. They had so little\nexpected perseverance from me that they gave all the credit to my\nexceptional abilities. Perhaps, too, in the marked success of the\nphilosophical ideas they had applied to my education they saw something\nof a triumph for themselves. Certain it is, I was not loath to let\nmyself be persuaded that I had great intellectual powers, and that I\nwas a man very much above the average. My dear instructors were soon to\ngather the sad fruit of their imprudence, and it was already too late to\ncheck the flight of my immoderate conceit.\n\nPerhaps, too, this abominable trait in my character, kept under by the\nbad treatment I had endured in childhood, was now merely revealing its\nexistence. There is reason to believe that we carry within us from our\nearliest years the seeds of those virtues and vices which are in time\nmade to bear fruit by the action of our environment. As for myself, I\nhad not yet found anything whereon my vanity could feed; for on what\ncould I have prided myself at the beginning of my acquaintance with\nEdmee? But no sooner was food forthcoming than suffering vanity rose up\nin triumph, and filled me with as much presumption as previously it had\ninspired me with bashfulness and boorish reserve. I was, moreover, as\ndelighted at being able at last to express my thoughts with ease as a\nyoung falcon fresh from the nest trying its wings for the first time.\nConsequently, I became as talkative as I had been silent. The others\nwere too indulgent to my prattle. I had not sense enough to see that\nthey were merely listening to me as they would to a spoilt child.\nI thought myself a man, and what is more, a remarkable man. I grew\narrogant and superlatively ridiculous.\n\nMy uncle, the chevalier, who had not taken any part in my education, and\nwho only smiled with fatherly good-nature at the first steps I took in\nmy new career, was the first to notice the false direction in which I\nwas advancing. He found it unbecoming that I should raise my voice\nas loudly as his own, and mentioned the matter to Edmee. With great\nsweetness she warned me of this, and, lest I should feel annoyed at her\nspeaking of it, told me that I was quite right in my argument, but that\nher father was now too old to be converted to new ideas, and that I\nought to sacrifice my enthusiastic affirmations to his patriarchal\ndignity. I promised not to repeat the offence; and I did not keep my\nword.\n\nThe fact is, the chevalier was imbued with many prejudices. Considering\nthe days in which he lived, he had received a very good education for a\ncountry nobleman; but the century had moved more rapidly than he. Edmee,\nardent and romantic; the abbe, full of sentiment and systems, had moved\neven more rapidly than the century; and if the vast gulf which lay\nbetween them and the patriarch was scarcely perceptible, this was owing\nto the respect which they rightly felt for him, and to the love he had\nfor his daughter. I rushed forward at full speed, as you may imagine,\ninto Edmee's ideas, but I had not, like herself, sufficient delicacy of\nfeeling to maintain a becoming reticence. The violence of my character\nfound an outlet in politics and philosophy, and I tasted unspeakable\npleasure in those heated disputes which at that time in France, not\nonly at all public meetings but also in the bosoms of families, were\npreluding the tempests of the Revolution. I doubt if there was a single\nhouse, from palace to hovel, which had not its orator--rugged, fiery,\nabsolute, and ready to descend into the parliamentary arena. I was the\norator of the chateau of Sainte-Severe, and my worthy uncle, accustomed\nto a resemblance of authority over those about him, which prevented him\nfrom seeing the real revolt of their minds, could ill endure such candid\nopposition as mine. He was proud and hot-tempered, and, moreover, had a\ndifficulty in expressing himself which increased his natural impatience,\nand made him feel annoyed with himself. He would give a furious kick to\nthe burning logs on the hearth; he would smash his eye-glasses into a\nthousand pieces; scatter clouds of snuff about the floor, and shout so\nviolently as to make the lofty ceilings of his mansion ring with his\nresonant voice. All this, I regret to say, amused me immensely; and with\nsome sentence but newly spelt out from my books I loved to destroy the\nfrail scaffolding of ideas which had served him all his life. This was\ngreat folly and very foolish pride on my part; but my love of opposition\nand my desire to display intellectually the energy which was wanting in\nmy physical life were continually carrying me away. In vain would Edmee\ncough, as a hint that I should say no more, and make an effort to save\nher father's _amour propre_ by bringing forward some argument in his\nfavour, though against her own judgement; the lukewarmness of her help,\nand my apparent submission to her only irritated my adversary more and\nmore.\n\n\"Let him have his say,\" he would cry; \"Edmee, you must not interfere; I\nwant to beat him on all points. If you continually interrupt us, I shall\nnever be able to make him see his absurdity.\"\n\nAnd then the squall would blow stronger from both sides, until at last\nthe chevalier, seriously offended, would walk out of the room, and go\nand vent his ill-humour on his huntsman or his hounds.\n\nWhat most contributed to the recurrence of these unseemly wrangles and\nto the growth of my ridiculous obstinacy was my uncle's extreme goodness\nand the rapidity of his recovery. At the end of an hour he had entirely\nforgotten my rudeness and his own irritation. He would speak to me as\nusual and inquire into all my wishes and all my wants with that fatherly\nsolicitude which always kept him in a benevolent mood. This incomparable\nman could never had slept had he not, before going to bed, embraced all\nhis family, and atoned, either by a word or a kindly glance, for any\nebullitions of temper which the meanest of his servants might have had\nto bear during the day. Such goodness ought to have disarmed me and\nclosed my mouth forever. Each evening I vowed that it should; but each\nmorning I returned, as the Scriptures say, to my vomit again.\n\nEdmee suffered more and more every day from this development of my\ncharacter. She cast about for means to cure it. If there was never\n_fiancee_ stronger-minded and more reserved than she, never was there\nmother more tender. After many discussions with the abbe she resolved to\npersuade her father to change the routine of our life somewhat, and to\nremove our establishment to Paris for the last weeks of the carnival.\nOur long stay in the country; the isolation which the position of\nSainte-Severe and the bad state of the roads had left us since the\nbeginning of winter; the monotony of our daily life--all tended to\nfoster our wearisome quibbling. My character was being more and more\nspoilt by it; and though it afforded my uncle even greater pleasure than\nmyself, his health suffered as a result, and the childish passions daily\naroused were no doubt hastening his decay. The abbe was suffering from\n_ennui_; Edmee was depressed. Whether in consequence of our mode of life\nor owing to causes unknown to the rest, it was her wish to go, and we\nwent; for her father was uneasy about her melancholy, and sought only to\ndo as she desired. I jumped for joy at the thought of seeing Paris; and\nwhile Edmee was flattering herself that intercourse with the world\nwould refine the grossness of my pedantry, I was dreaming of a triumphal\nprogress through the world which had been held up to such scorn by our\nphilosophers. We started on our journey one fine morning in March; the\nchevalier with his daughter and Mademoiselle Leblanc in one post-chaise;\nmyself in another with the abbe, who could ill conceal his delight at\nthe thought of seeing the capital for the first time in him life; and my\nvalet Saint-Jean, who, lest he should forget his customary politeness,\nmade profound bows to every individual we passed.\n\n\n\n\nXII\n\nOld Bernard, tired from talking so long, had promised to resume his\nstory on the morrow. At the appointed hour we called upon him to keep\nhis word; and he continued thus:\n\n\nThis visit marked a new phase in my life. At Sainte-Severe I had been\nabsorbed in my love and my work. I had concentrated all my energies upon\nthese two points. No sooner had I arrived at Paris than a thick curtain\nseemed to fall before my eyes, and, for several days, as I could not\nunderstand anything, I felt astonished at nothing. I formed a very\nexaggerated estimate of the passing actors who appeared upon the scene;\nbut I formed no less exaggerated an estimate of the ease with which\nI should soon rival these imaginary powers. My enterprising and\npresumptuous nature saw challenges everywhere and obstacles nowhere.\n\nThough I was in the same house as my uncle and cousin, my room was on a\nseparate floor, and henceforth I spent the greater part of my time with\nthe abbe. I was far from being dazed by the material advantages of my\nposition; but in proportion as I realized how precarious or painful were\nthe positions of many others, the more conscious I became of the comfort\nof my own. I appreciated the excellent character of my tutor, and the\nrespect my lackey showed me no longer seemed objectionable. With the\nfreedom that I enjoyed, and the unlimited money at my command, and the\nrestless energy of youth, it is astonishing that I did not fall into\nsome excess, were it only gambling, which might well have appealed to\nmy combative instincts. It was my own ignorance of everything that\nprevented this; it made me extremely suspicious, and the abbe, who was\nvery observant, and held himself responsible for my actions, managed\nmost cleverly to work upon my haughty reserve. He increased it in regard\nto such things as might have done me harm, and dispelled it in contrary\ncases. Moreover, he was careful to provide me with sufficient reasonable\ndistractions, which while they could not take the place of the joys\nof love, served at least to lessen the smart of its wounds. As to\ntemptations to debauchery, I felt none. I had too much pride to yearn\nfor any woman in which I had not seen, as in Edmee, the first of her\nsex.\n\nWe used all to meet at dinner, and as a rule we paid visits in the\nevening. By observing the world from a corner of a drawing-room, I\nlearnt more of it in a few days than I should have done in a whole\nyear from guesses and inquiries. I doubt whether I should ever have\nunderstood society, if I had always been obliged to view it from a\ncertain distance. My brain refused to form a clear image of the ideas\nwhich occupied the brains of others. But as soon as I found myself in\nthe midst of this chaos, the confused mass was compelled to fall into\nsome sort of order and reveal a large part of its elements. This path\nwhich led me into life was not without charms for me, I remember, at its\nbeginning. Amid all the conflicting interests of the surrounding world I\nhad nothing to ask for, aim at, or argue about. Fortune had taken me by\nthe hand. One fine morning she had lifted me out of an abyss and put me\ndown on a bed of roses and made me a young gentleman. The eagerness of\nothers was for me but an amusing spectacle. My heart was interested\nin the future only on one mysterious point, the love which I felt for\nEdmee.\n\nMy illness, far from robbing me of my physical vigour, had but increased\nit. I was no longer the heavy, sleepy animal, fatigued by digestion and\nstupefied by weariness. I felt the vibrations of all my fibres filling\nmy soul with unknown harmonies; and I was astonished to discover within\nmyself faculties of which I had never suspected the use. My good kinfolk\nwere delighted at this, though apparently not surprised. They had\nallowed themselves to augur so well of me from the beginning that it\nseemed as if they had been accustomed all their lives to the trade of\ncivilizing barbarians.\n\nThe nervous system which had just been developed in me, and which made\nme pay for the pleasures and advantages it brought by keen and constant\nsufferings during the rest of my life, had rendered me specially\nsensitive to impressions from without; and this quickness to feel the\neffect of external things was helped by an organic vigour such as is\nonly found among animals or savages. I was astounded at the decay of\nthe faculties in other people. These men in spectacles, these women with\ntheir sense of smell deadened by snuff, these premature graybeards,\ndeaf and gouty before their time, were painful to behold. To me society\nseemed like a vast hospital; and when with my robust constitution I\nfound myself in the midst of these weaklings, it seemed to me that with\na puff of my breath I could have blown them into the air as if they had\nbeen so much thistle-down.\n\nThis unfortunately led me into the error of yielding to that rather\nstupid kind of pride which makes a man presume upon his natural gifts.\nFor a long time it induced me to neglect their real improvement, as if\nthis were a work of supererogation. The idea that gradually grew up in\nme of the worthlessness of my fellows prevented me from rising above\nthose whom I henceforth looked upon as my inferiors. I did not\nrealize that society is made up of so many elements of little value in\nthemselves, but so skilfully and solidly put together that before adding\nthe least extraneous particle a man must be a qualified artificer. I did\nnot know that in this society there is no resting-place between the role\nof the great artist and that of the good workman. Now, I was neither one\nnor the other, and, if the truth must be told, all my ideas have never\nsucceeded in lifting me out of the ordinary ruck; all my strength has\nonly enabled me with much difficulty to do as others do.\n\nIn a few weeks, then, I passed from an excess of admiration to an excess\nof contempt for society. As soon as I understood the workings of its\nsprings they seemed to me so miserably regulated by a feeble generation\nthat the hopes of my mentors, unknown to themselves, were doomed to\ndisappointment. Instead of realizing my own inferiority and endeavouring\nto efface myself in the crowd, I imagined that I could give proof of\nmy superiority whenever I wished; and I fed on fancies which I blush to\nrecall. If I did not show myself egregiously ridiculous, it was thanks\nto the very excess of this vanity which feared to stultify itself before\nothers.\n\nAt that time Paris presented a spectacle which I shall not attempt to\nset before you, because no doubt you have often eagerly studied it in\nthe excellent pictures which have been painted by eye-witnesses in the\nform of general history or private memoirs. Besides, such a picture\nwould exceed the limits of my story, for I promised to tell you only the\ncardinal events in my moral and philosophical development. In order to\ngive you some idea of the workings of my mind at this period it will\nsuffice to mention that the War of Independence was breaking out in\nAmerica; that Voltaire was receiving his apotheosis in Paris; that\nFranklin, the prophet of a new political religion, was sowing the seed\nof liberty in the very heart of the Court of France; while Lafayette\nwas secretly preparing his romantic expedition. The majority of young\npatricians were being carried away either by fashion, or the love\nof change, or the pleasure inherent in all opposition which is not\ndangerous.\n\nOpposition took a graver form and called for more serious work in the\ncase of the old nobles, and among the members of the parliaments. The\nspirit of the League was alive again in the ranks of these ancient\npatricians and these haughty magistrates, who for form's sake were still\nsupporting the tottering monarchy with one arm, while with the other\nthey gave considerable help to the invasions of philosophy. The\nprivileged classes of society were zealously lending a hand to the\nimminent destruction of their privileges by complaining that these had\nbeen curtailed by the kings. They were bringing up their children in\nconstitutional principles, because they imagined they were going to\nfound a new monarchy in which the people would help them to regain\ntheir old position above the throne; and it is for this reason that the\ngreatest admiration for Voltaire and the most ardent sympathies with\nFranklin were openly expressed in the most famous salons in Paris.\n\nSo unusual and, if it must be said, so unnatural a movement of the human\nmind had infused fresh life into the vestiges of the Court of Louis\nXIV, and replaced the customary coldness and stiffness by a sort of\nquarrelsome vivacity. It had also introduced certain serious forms into\nthe frivolous manners of the regency, and lent them an appearance of\ndepth. The pure but colourless life of Louis XVI counted for nothing,\nand influenced nobody. Never had there been such serious chatter, so\nmany flimsy maxims, such an affectation of wisdom, so much inconsistency\nbetween words and deeds as might have been found at this period among\nthe so-called enlightened classes.\n\nIt was necessary to remind you of this in order that you might\nunderstand the admiration which I had at first for a world apparently\nso disinterested, so courageous, so eager in the pursuit of truth, and\nlikewise the disgust which I was soon to feel for so much affectation\nand levity, for such an abuse of the most hallowed words and the most\nsacred convictions. For my own part, I was perfectly sincere; and I\nfounded my philosophic fervour (that recently discovered sentiment of\nliberty which was then called the cult of reason) on the broad base of\nan inflexible logic. I was young and of a good constitution, the first\ncondition perhaps of a healthy mind; my reading, though not extensive,\nwas solid, for I had been fed on food easy of digestion. The little I\nknew served to show me, therefore, that others either knew nothing at\nall, or were giving themselves the lie.\n\nAt the commencement of our stay in Paris the chevalier had but few\nvisitors. The friend and contemporary of Turgot and several other\ndistinguished men, he had not mixed with the gilded youth of his day,\nbut had lived soberly in the country after loyally serving in the wars.\nHis circle of friends, therefore, was composed of a few grave gentlemen\nof the long robe, several old soldiers, and a few nobles from his own\nprovince, both old and young, who, thanks to a respectable fortune,\nwere able, like himself, to come and spend the winter in Paris. He had,\nmoreover, kept up a slight intercourse with a more brilliant set, among\nwhom Edmee's beauty and refined manners were noticed as soon as she\nappeared. Being an only daughter, and passably rich, she was sought\nafter by various important matrons, those procuresses of quality who\nhave always a few young proteges whom they wish to clear from debt at\nthe expense of some family in the provinces. And then, when it became\nknown that she was engaged to M. de la Marche, the almost ruined scion\nof a very illustrious family, she was still more kindly received, until\nby degrees the little salon which she had chosen for her father's old\nfriends became too small for the wits by quality and profession, and\nthe grand ladies with a turn for philosophy who wished to know the young\nQuakeress, the Rose of Berry (such were the names given her by a certain\nfashionable woman).\n\nThis rapid success in a world in which she had hitherto been unknown by\nno mean dazzled Edmee; and the control which she possessed over herself\nwas so great that, in spite of all the anxiety with which I watched\nher slightest movement, I could never discover if she felt flattered at\ncausing such a stir. But what I could perceive was the admirable good\nsense manifested in everything she did and everything she said. Her\nmanner, at once ingenuous and reserved, and a certain blending of\nunconstraint with modest pride, made her shine even among the women who\nwere the most admired and the most skilled in attracting attention. And\nthis is the place to mention that at first I was extremely shocked at\nthe tone and bearing of these women, whom everybody extolled; to me\nthey seemed ridiculous in their studied posings, and their grand society\nmanners looked very much like insufferable effrontery. Yes, I, so\nintrepid at heart, and but lately so coarse in my manners, felt ill at\nease and abashed in their presence; and it needed all Edmee's reproaches\nand remonstrances to prevent me from displaying a profound contempt for\nthis meretriciousness of glances, of toilets, and allurements which\nwas known in society as allowable coquetry, as the charming desire to\nplease, as amiability, and as grace. The abbe was of my opinion. When\nthe guests had gone we members of the family used to gather round the\nfireside for a short while before separating. It is at such a time that\none feels an impulse to bring together one's scattered impressions and\ncommunicate them to some sympathetic being. The abbe, then, would break\nthe same lances as myself with my uncle and cousin. The chevalier, who\nwas an ardent admirer of the fair sex, of which he had had but little\nexperience, used to take upon himself, like a true French knight, to\ndefend all the beauties that we were attacking so unmercifully. He would\nlaughingly accuse the abbe of arguing about women as the fox in the\nfable argued about the grapes. For myself, I used to improve under the\nabbe's criticisms; this was an emphatic way of letting Edmee know how\nmuch I preferred her to all others. She, however, appeared to be more\nscandalized than flattered, and seriously reproved me for the tendency\nto malevolence which had its origin, she said, in my inordinate pride.\n\nIt is true that after generously undertaking the defence of the persons\nin question, she would come over to our opinion as soon as, Rousseau in\nhand, we told her that the women in Paris society had cavalier manners\nand a way of looking a man in the face which must needs be intolerable\nin the eyes of a sage. When once Rousseau had delivered judgment,\nEdmee would object no further; she was ready to admit with him that the\ngreatest charm of a woman is the intelligent and modest attention she\ngives to serious discussions, and I always used to remind her of the\ncomparison of a superior woman to a beautiful child with its great eyes\nfull of feeling and sweetness and delicacy, with its shy questionings\nand its objections full of sense. I hoped that she would recognise\nherself in this portrait upon the text, and, enlarging the portrait:\n\n\"A really superior woman,\" I said, looking at her earnestly, \"is one\nwho knows enough to prevent her from asking a ridiculous or unseasonable\nquestion, or from ever measuring swords with men of merit. Such a woman\nknows when to be silent, especially with the fools whom she could laugh\nat, or the ignorant whom she could humiliate. She is indulgent towards\nabsurdities because she does not yearn to display her knowledge, and\nshe is observant of whatsoever is good, because she desires to improve\nherself. Her great object is to understand, not to instruct. The great\nart (since it is recognised that art is required even in the commerce of\nwords) is not to pit against one another two arrogant opponents,\neager to parade their learning and to amuse the company by discussing\nquestions the solution of which no one troubles about, but to illumine\nevery unprofitable disputation by bringing in the help of all who can\nthrow a little light on the points at issue. This is a talent of which\nI can see no signs among the hostesses who are so cried up. In their\nhouses I always find two fashionable barristers, and a thunderstruck\naudience, in which no one dares to be judge. The only art these ladies\nhave is to make the man of genius ridiculous, and the ordinary man dumb\nand inert. One comes away from such houses saying, 'Those were fine\nspeeches,' and nothing more.\"\n\nI really think that I was in the right here; but I cannot forget that my\nchief cause of anger against these women arose from the fact that they\npaid no attention to people, however able they might think themselves,\nunless they happened to be famous--the _people_ being myself, as you may\neasily imagine. On the other hand, now that I look back on those days\nwithout prejudice and without any sense of wounded vanity, I am certain\nthat these women had a way of fawning on public favourites which was\nmuch more like childish conceit than sincere admiration or candid\nsympathy. They became editors, as it were, of the conversation,\nlistening with all their might and making peremptory signals to the\naudience to listen to every triviality issuing from an illustrious\nmouth; while they would suppress a yawn and drum with their fans at\nall remarks, however excellent, as soon as they were unsigned by a\nfashionable name. I am ignorant of the airs of the intellectual women\nof the nineteenth century; nay, I do not know if the race still exists.\nThirty years have passed since I mixed in society; but, as to the past,\nyou may believe what I tell you. There were five or six of these\nwomen who were absolutely odious to me. One of them had some wit, and\nscattered her epigrams right and left. These were at once hawked about\nin all drawing-rooms, and I had to listen to them twenty times in a\nsingle day. Another had read Montesquieu, and gave lessons in law to the\noldest magistrates. A third used to play the harp execrably, but it was\nagreed that her arms were the most beautiful in France, and we had to\nendure the harsh scraping of her nails over the strings so that she\nmight have an opportunity of removing her gloves like a coy little girl.\nWhat can I say of the others, except that they vied with one another in\nall those affectations and fatuous insincerities, by which all the men\nchildishly allowed themselves to be duped. One alone was really pretty,\nsaid nothing, and gave pleasure by her very lack of artificiality. To\nher I might have been favourably inclined because of her ignorance, had\nshe not gloried in this, and tried to emphasize her difference from the\nothers by a piquant ingenuousness. One day I discovered that she had\nplenty of wit, and straightway I abhorred her.\n\nEdmee alone preserved all the freshness of sincerity and all the\ndistinction of natural grace. Sitting on a sofa by the side of M. de\nMalesherbes, she was for me the same being that I had gazed on so many\ntimes in the light of the setting sun, as she sat on the stone seat at\nthe door of Patience's cottage.\n\n\n\n\nXIII\n\nYou will readily believe that all the homage paid to my cousin fanned\ninto fresh flames the jealousy which had been smouldering in my breast.\nSince the day when, in obedience to her command, I began to devote\nmyself to work, I could hardly say whether I had dared to count on\nher promise that she would become my wife as soon as I was able to\nunderstand her ideas and feelings. To me, indeed, it seemed that the\ntime for this had already arrived; for it is certain that I understood\nEdmee, better perhaps than any of the men who were paying their\naddresses to her in prose and verse. I had firmly resolved not to\npresume upon the oath extorted from her at Roche-Mauprat; yet, when I\nremembered her last promise, freely given at the chapel window, and the\ninferences which I could have drawn from her conversation with the abbe\nwhich I had overheard in the parlour at Sainte-Severe; when I remembered\nher earnestness in preventing me from going away and in directing my\neducation; the motherly attentions she had lavished on me during my\nillness--did not all these things give me, if not some right, at least\nsome reason to hope? It is true that her friendship would become icy as\nsoon as my passion betrayed itself in words or looks; it is true that\nsince the first day I saw her I had not advanced a single step towards\nclose affection; it is also true that M. de la Marche frequently came to\nthe house, and that she always showed him as much friendship as myself,\nthough with less familiarity and more respect in it, a distinction which\nwas naturally due to the difference in our characters and our ages, and\ndid not indicate any preference for one or the other. It was possible,\ntherefore, to attribute her promise to the prompting of her conscience;\nthe interest which she took in my studies to her worship of human\ndignity as it stood rehabilitated by philosophy; her quiet and continued\naffection for M. de la March to a profound regret, kept in subjection\nby the strength and wisdom of her mind. These perplexities I felt very\nacutely. The hope of compelling her love by submission and devotion had\nsustained me; but this hope was beginning to grow weak; for though, as\nall allowed, I had made prodigious efforts and extraordinary progress,\nEdmee's regard for me had been very far from increasing in the same\nproportion. She had not shown any astonishment at what she called my\nlofty intellect; she had always believed in it; she had praised it\nunreasonably. But she was not blind to the faults in my character,\nto the vices of my soul. She had reproached me with these with an\ninexorable sweetness, with a patience calculated to drive me to despair;\nfor she seemed to have made up her mind that, whatever the future might\nbring, she would never love me more and never less.\n\nMeanwhile all were paying court to her and none were accepted. It had,\nindeed, been given out that she was engaged to M. de la Marche, but no\none understood any better than myself the indefinite postponement of the\nmarriage. People came to the conclusion that she was seeking a pretext\nto get rid of him, and they could find no ground for her repugnance\nexcept by supposing that she had conceived a great passion for myself.\nMy strange history had caused some stir; the women examined me with\ncuriosity; the men seemed interested in me and showed me a sort of\nrespect which I affected to despise, but to which, however, I was far\nfrom insensible. And, since nothing finds credence in the world until it\nis embellished with some fiction, people strangely exaggerated my wit,\nmy capabilities and my learning; but, as soon as they had seen M. de\nla Marche and myself in Edmee's company, all their inferences were\nannihilated by the composure and ease of our manners. To both of us\nEdmee was the same in public as in private; M. de la Marche, a soulless\npuppet, was perfectly drilled in conventional manners; and myself, a\nprey to divers passions, but inscrutable by reason of my pride and also,\nI must confess, of my pretensions to the sublimity of the _American\nmanner_. I should tell you that I had been fortunate enough to be\nintroduced to Franklin as a sincere devotee of liberty. Sir Arthur\nLee had honoured me with a certain kindness and some excellent advice;\nconsequently my head was somewhat turned, even as the heads of those\nwhom I railed at so bitterly were turned, and to such an extent that\nthis little vainglory brought sorely needed relief to my agonies of\nmind. Perhaps you will shrug your shoulders when I own that I took the\ngreatest pleasure in the world in leaving my hair unpowdered, in\nwearing big shoes, and appearing everywhere in a dark-coloured coat, of\naggressively simple cut and stiffly neat--in a word, in aping, as far as\nwas then permissible without being mistaken for a regular plebeian, the\ndress and ways of the Bonhomme Richard! I was nineteen, and I was living\nin an age when every one affected a part--that is my only excuse.\n\nI might plead also that my too indulgent and too simple tutor openly\napproved of my conduct; that my Uncle Hubert, though he occasionally\nlaughed at me, let me do as I wished, and that Edmee said absolutely\nnothing about this ridiculous affectation, and appeared never to notice\nit.\n\nMeanwhile spring had returned; we were going back to the country; the\nsalons were being gradually deserted. For myself, I was still in the\nsame state of uncertainty. I noticed one day that M. de la Marche seemed\nanxious to find an opportunity of speaking to Edmee in private. At first\nI found pleasure in making him suffer, and did not stir from my chair.\nHowever, I thought I detected on Edmee's brow that slight frown which I\nknew so well, and after a silent dialogue with myself I went out of the\nroom, resolving to observe the results of this _tete-a-tete_, and to\nlearn my fate, whatever it might be.\n\nAt the end of an hour I returned to the drawing-room. My uncle was\nthere; M. de la Marche was staying to dinner; Edmee seemed meditative\nbut not melancholy; the abbe's eyes were putting questions to her which\nshe did not understand, or did not wish to understand.\n\nM. de la Marche accompanied my uncle to the Comedie Francaise. Edmee\nsaid that she had some letters to write and requested permission to\nremain at home. I followed the count and the chevalier, but after the\nfirst act I made my escape and returned to the house. Edmee had given\norders that she was not to be disturbed; but I did not consider that\nthis applied to myself; the servants thought it quite natural that\nI should behave as the son of the house. I entered the drawing-room,\nfearful lest Edmee should have retired to her bed-room; for there I\ncould not have followed her. She was sitting near the fire and amusing\nherself by pulling out the petals of the blue and white asters which I\nhad gathered during a walk to the tomb of Jean Jacques Rousseau.\nThese flowers brought back to me a night of ecstasy, under the clear\nmoonlight, the only hours of happiness, perhaps, that I could mention in\nall my life.\n\n\"Back already?\" she said, without any change of attitude.\n\n\"Already is an unkind word,\" I replied. \"Would you like me to retire to\nmy room, Edmee?\"\n\n\"By no means; you are not disturbing me at all; but you would have\nderived more profit from seeing _Merope_ than from listening to my\nconversation this evening; for I warn you that I feel a complete idiot.\"\n\n\"So much the better, cousin; I shall not feel humiliated this evening,\nsince for the first time we shall be upon a footing of equality. But,\nmight I ask you why you so despise my asters? I thought that you would\nprobably keep them as a souvenir.\"\n\n\"Of Rousseau?\" she asked with a malicious little smile, and without\nraising her eyes to mine.\n\n\"Naturally that was my meaning,\" I answered.\n\n\"I am playing a most interesting game,\" she said; \"do not interrupt me.\"\n\n\"I know it,\" I said. \"All the children in Varenne play it, and there is\nnot a lass but believes in the decree of fate that it revels. Would\nyou like me to read your thoughts as you pull out these petals four by\nfour?\"\n\n\"Come, then, O mighty magician!\"\n\n\"A little, that is how some one loves you; much, that is how you love\nhim; passionately, that is how another loves you; not at all, thus do\nyou love this other.\"\n\n\"And might I inquire, Sir Oracle,\" replied Edmee, whose face became more\nserious, \"who some one and another may be? I suspect that you are like\nthe Pythonesses of old; you do not know the meaning of your auguries\nyourself.\"\n\n\"Could you not guess mine, Edmee?\"\n\n\"I will try to interpret the riddle, if you will promise that afterward\nyou will do what the Sphinx did when vanquished by OEdipus.\"\n\n\"Oh, Edmee,\" I cried; \"think how long I have been running my head\nagainst walls on account of you and your interpretations. And yet you\nhave not guessed right a single time.\"\n\n\"Oh, good heavens! I have,\" she said, throwing the bouquet on to the\nmantel-piece. \"You shall see. I love M. de la Marche a little, and I\nlove you much. He loves me passionately, and you love me not at all.\nThat is the truth.\"\n\n\"I forgive you this malicious interpretation with all my heart for the\nsake of the word 'much,'\" I replied.\n\nI tried to take her hands. She drew them away quickly, though, in fact,\nshe had no need to fear; for had she given me them, I merely intended to\npress them in brotherly fashion; but this appearance of distrust aroused\nmemories which were dangerous for me. I fancy she showed a great deal of\ncoquetry that evening in her expression and manners; and, until then,\nI had never seen the least inclination toward it. I felt my courage\nrising, though I could not explain why; and I ventured on some pointed\nremarks about her interview with M. de la Marche. She made no effort\nto deny my interpretations, and began to laugh when I told her that she\nought to thank me for my exquisite politeness in retiring as soon as I\nsaw her knit her brow.\n\nHer supercilious levity was beginning to irritate me a little, when\na servant entered and handed her a letter, saying that some one was\nwaiting for an answer.\n\n\"Go to my writing-table and cut a pen for me, please,\" she said to me.\n\nWith an air of unconcern she broke the seal and ran through the letter,\nwhile I, quite ignorant of the contents, began preparing her writing\nmaterials.\n\nFor some time the crow-quill had been cut ready for use; for some time\nthe paper with its coloured vignette had been waiting by the side of\nthe amber writing-case; yet Edmee paid no attention to them and made no\nattempt to use them. The letter lay open in her lap; her feet were\non the fire-dogs, her elbows on the arm of her chair in her favourite\nattitude of meditation. She was completely absorbed. I spoke to her\nsoftly; she did not hear me. I thought that she had forgotten the letter\nand had fallen asleep. After a quarter of an hour the servant came back\nand said that the messenger wished to know if there was any answer.\n\n\"Certainly,\" she replied; \"ask him to wait.\"\n\nShe read the letter again with the closest attention, and began to\nwrite slowly; then she threw her reply into the fire, pushed away the\narm-chair with her foot, walked round the room a few times, and suddenly\nstopped in front of me and looked at me in a cold, hard manner.\n\n\"Edmee,\" I cried, springing to me feet, \"what is the matter, and how\ndoes that letter which is worrying you so much concern myself?\"\n\n\"What is that to you?\" she replied.\n\n\"What is that to me?\" I cried. \"And what is the air I breathe to me? and\nwhat is the blood that flows in my veins? Ask me that, if you like, but\ndo not ask how one of your words or one of your glances can concern me;\nfor you know very well that my life depends on them.\"\n\n\"Do not talk nonsense now, Bernard,\" she answered, returning to her\narm-chair in a distracted manner. \"There is a time for everything.\"\n\n\"Edmee, Edmee! do not play with the sleeping lion, do not stir up the\nfire which is smouldering in the ashes.\"\n\nShe shrugged her shoulders, and began to write with great rapidity. Her\nface was flushed, and from time to time she passed her fingers through\nthe long hair which fell in ringlets over her shoulders. She was\ndangerously beautiful in her agitation; she looked as if in love--but\nwith whom? Doubtless with him to whom she was writing. I began to feel\nthe fires of jealousy. I walked out of the room abruptly and crossed the\nhall. I looked at the man who had brought the letter; he was in M. de la\nMarche's livery. I had no further doubts; this, however, only increased\nmy rage. I returned to the drawing-room and threw open the door\nviolently. Edmee did not even turn her head; she continued writing. I\nsat down opposite her, and stared at her with flashing eyes. She did\nnot deign to raise her own to mine. I even fancied that I noticed on\nher ruby lips the dawn of a smile which seemed an insult to my agony.\nAt last she finished her letter and sealed it. I rose and walked towards\nher, feeling strongly tempted to snatch it from her hands. I had learnt\nto control myself somewhat better than of old; but I realized how, with\npassionate souls, a single instant may destroy the labours of many days.\n\n\"Edmee,\" I said to her, in a bitter tone, and with a frightful grimace\nthat was intended to be a sarcastic smile, \"would you like me to hand\nthis letter to M. de la Marche's lackey, and at the same time tell him\nin a whisper at what time his master may come to the tryst?\"\n\n\"It seems to me,\" she replied, with a calmness that exasperated me,\n\"that it was possible to mention the time in my letter, and that there\nis no need to inform a servant of it.\"\n\n\"Edmee, you ought to be a little more considerate of me,\" I cried.\n\n\"That doesn't trouble me the least in the world,\" she replied.\n\nAnd throwing me the letter she had received across the table she went\nout to give the answer to the messenger herself. I do not know whether\nshe had told me to read this letter; but I do know that the impulse\nwhich urged me to do so was irresistible. It ran somewhat as follows:\n\n\"Edmee, I have at last discovered the fatal secret which, according to\nyou, sets an impassable barrier in the way of our union. Bernard loves\nyou; his agitation this morning betrayed him. But you do not love him, I\nam sure . . . that would be impossible! You would have told me frankly.\nThe obstacle, then, must be elsewhere. Forgive me! It has come to my\nknowledge that you spent two hours in the brigand's den. Unhappy girl!\nyour misfortune, your prudence, your sublime delicacy make you still\nnobler in my eyes. And why did you not confide to me at once the\nmisfortune of which you were a victim? I could have eased your sorrow\nand my own by a word. I could have helped you to hide your secret. I\ncould have wept with you; or, rather, I could have wiped out the odious\nrecollection by displaying an attachment proof against anything. But\nthere is no need to despair; there is still time to say this word, and\nI do so now: Edmee, I love you more than ever; more than ever I am\nresolved to offer you my name; will you deign to accept it?\"\n\nThis note was signed Adhemar de la Marche.\n\nI had scarcely finished reading it when Edmee returned, and came towards\nthe fire-place with an anxious look, as if she had forgotten some\nprecious object. I handed her the letter that I had just read; but she\ntook it absently, and, stooping over the hearth with an air of relief,\neagerly seized a crumpled piece of paper which the flames had merely\nscorched. This was the first answer she had written to M. de la Marche's\nnote, the one she had not judged fit to send.\n\n\"Edmee,\" I said, throwing myself on my knees, \"let me see that letter.\nWhatever if may be, I will submit to the decree dictated by your first\nimpulse.\"\n\n\"You really would?\" she asked, with an indefinable expression.\n\"Supposing I loved M. de la Marche, and that I was making a great\nsacrifice for your sake in refusing him, would you be generous enough to\nrelease me from my word?\"\n\nI hesitated for a moment. A cold sweat broke out all over me. I looked\nher full in the face; but her eyes were inscrutable and betrayed no hint\nof her thoughts. If I had fancied that she really loved me and that\nshe was putting my virtue to the test, I should perhaps have played the\nhero; but I was afraid of some trap. My passion overmastered me. I felt\nthat I had not the strength to renounce my claim with a good grace; and\nhypocrisy was repugnant to me. I rose to my feet, trembling with rage.\n\n\"You love him!\" I cried. \"Confess that you love him!\"\n\n\"And if I did,\" she answered, putting the letter in her pocket, \"where\nwould be the crime?\"\n\n\"The crime would be that hitherto you have lied in telling me that you\ndid not love him.\"\n\n\"Hitherto is saying a good deal,\" she rejoined, looking at me fixedly;\n\"we have not discussed the matter since last year. At that time it was\npossible that I did not love Adhemar very much, and at present it might\nbe possible that I loved him more than you. If I compare the conduct of\nboth to-day I see on the one hand a man without proper pride and without\ndelicacy, presuming upon a promise which my heart perhaps has never\nratified; on the other I see an admirable friend whose sublime devotion\nis ready to brave all prejudices; who--believing that I bear the smirch\nof an indelible shame--is none the less prepared to cover the blot with\nhis protection.\"\n\n\"What! this wretch believes that I have done violence to you, and yet\ndoes not challenge me to a duel?\"\n\n\"That is not what he believes, Bernard. He knows that you rescued me\nfrom Roche-Mauprat; but he thinks that you helped me too late, and that\nI was the victim of the other brigands.\"\n\n\"And he wants to marry you, Edmee? Either the man's devotion is sublime,\nas you say, or he is deeper in debt than you think.\"\n\n\"How dare you say that?\" said Edmee angrily. \"Such an odious explanation\nof generous conduct can proceed only from an unfeeling soul or a\nperverse mind. Be silent, unless you wish me to hate you.\"\n\n\"Say that you hate me, Edmee; say so without fear; I know it.\"\n\n\"Without fear! You should know likewise that I have not yet done you the\nhonour to fear you. However, tell me this: without inquiring into what\nI intend to do, can you understand that you ought to give me my liberty,\nand abandon your barbarous rights?\"\n\n\"I understand nothing except that I love you madly, and that these nails\nof mine shall tear out the heart of any man who tries to win you from\nme. I know that I shall force you to love me, and that, if I do not\nsucceed, I will at any rate not let you belong to another while I am\nalive. The man will have to walk over my body riddled with wounds\nand bleeding from every pore, ere he can put the wedding-ring on your\nfinger; with my last breath, too, I will dishonour you by proclaiming\nthat you are my mistress, and thus cloud the joy of any man who may\ntriumph over me; and if I can stab you as I die, I will, so that in the\ntomb, at least, you may be my wife. That is what I purpose doing, Edmee.\nAnd now, practise all your arts on me; lead me on from trap to trap;\nrule me with your admirable diplomacy. I may be duped a hundred times\nbecause of my ignorance, but have I not sworn by the name of Mauprat?\"\n\n\"Mauprat the Hamstringer!\" she added with freezing irony.\n\nAnd she turned to go out.\n\nI was about to seize her arm when the bell rang; it was the abbe who had\nreturned. As soon as he appeared Edmee shook hands with him, and retired\nto her room without saying a single word to me.\n\nThe good abbe, noticing my agitation, questioned me with that assurance\nwhich his claims on my affections were henceforth to give him. The\npresent matter, however, was the only one on which we had never had an\nexplanation. In vain had he sought to introduce it. He had not given\nme a single lesson in history without leading up to some famous love\naffairs and drawing from them an example or a precept of moderation or\ngenerosity; but he had not succeeded in making me breathe a word on this\nsubject. I could not bring myself to forgive him altogether for having\ndone me an ill turn with Edmee. I even had a suspicion that he was still\ninjuring my cause; and I therefore put myself on guard against all the\narguments of his philosophy and all the seductions of his friendship. On\nthis special evening I was more unassailable than ever. I left him ill\nat ease and depressed, and went and threw myself on my bed, where I\nburied my head in the clothes so as to stifle the customary sobs, those\npitiless conquerors of my pride and my rage.\n\n\n\n\nXIV\n\nThe next day I was in a state of gloomy despair; Edmee was icily cold;\nM. de la Marche did not come. I fancied I had seen the abbe going\nto call on him, and subsequently telling Edmee the result of their\ninterview. However, they betrayed no signs of agitation, and I had\nto endure my suspense in silence. I could not get a minute with Edmee\nalone. In the morning I went on foot to M. de la Marche's house. What I\nintended saying to him I do not know; my state of exasperation was such\nthat it drove me to act without either object or plan. Having learnt\nthat he had left Paris, I returned. I found my uncle very depressed.\nOn seeing me he frowned, and, after forcing himself to exchange a few\nmeaningless words with me, left me to the abbe, who tried to draw me\non to speak, but succeeded no better than the night before. For several\ndays I sought an opportunity of speaking with Edmee, but she always\nmanaged to avoid it. Preparations were being made for the return to\nSainte-Severe; she seemed neither sorry nor pleased at the prospect.\nI determined to slip a note between the page of her book asking for an\ninterview. Within five minutes I received the following reply:\n\n\"An interview would lead to nothing. You are persisting in your boorish\nbehaviour; I shall persevere in what I believe to be the path of\nintegrity. An upright conscience cannot go from its word. I had sworn\nnever to be any man's but yours. I shall not marry, for I did not swear\nthat I would be yours whatever might happen. If you continue to be\nunworthy of my esteem I shall take steps to remain free. My poor father\nis sinking into the grave; a convent shall be my refuge when the only\ntie which binds me to the world is broken.\"\n\nI had fulfilled all the conditions imposed by Edmee, and now, it seemed,\nher only return was an order that I should break them. I thus found\nmyself in the same position as on the day of her conversation with the\nabbe.\n\nI passed the remainder of the day shut up in my room. All through the\nnight I walked up and down in violent agitation. I made no effort to\nsleep. I will not tell you the thoughts that passed through my\nmind; they were not unworthy of an honest man. At daybreak I was at\nLafayette's house. He procured me the necessary papers for leaving\nFrance. He told me to go and await him in Spain, whence he was going to\nsail for the United States. I returned to our house to get the clothes\nand money indispensable to the humblest of travellers. I left a note\nfor my uncle, so that he might not feel uneasy at my absence; this I\npromised to explain very soon in a long letter. I begged him to refrain\nfrom passing sentence on me until it arrived, and assured him that I\nshould never forget all his goodness.\n\nI left before any one in the house was up; for I was afraid that my\nresolution might be shaken at the least sign of friendship, and I felt\nthat I could no longer impose upon a too generous affection. I could\nnot, however, pass Edmee's door without pressing my lips to the lock.\nThen, hiding my head in my hands, I rushed away like a madman, and\nscarcely stopped until I had reached the other side of the Pyrenees.\nThere I took a short rest, and wrote to Edmee that, as far as concerned\nmyself, she was free; that I would not thwart a single wish of hers; but\nthat it was impossible for me to be a witness of my rival's triumph. I\nfelt firmly convinced that she loved him; and I resolved to crush out\nmy own love. I was promising more than I could perform; but these first\nmanifestations of wounded pride gave me confidence in myself. I also\nwrote to my uncle to tell him I should not hold myself worthy of the\nboundless affection he had bestowed on me until I had won my spurs as a\nknight. I confided to him my hopes of a soldier's fame and fortune with\nall the candour of conceit; and since I felt sure that Edmee would\nread this letter I feigned unclouded delight and an ardour that knew no\nregrets; I did not know whether my uncle was aware of the real cause of\nmy departure; but my pride could not bring itself to confess. It was the\nsame with the abbe, to whom I likewise wrote a letter full of gratitude\nand affection. I ended by begging my uncle to put himself to no expense\non my account over the gloomy keep at Roche-Mauprat, assuring him that I\ncould never bring myself to live there. I urged him to consider the fief\nas his daughter's property, and only asked that he would be good enough\nto advance me my share of the income for two or three years, so that I\nmight pay the expenses of my own outfit, and thus prevent my devotion to\nthe American cause from being a burden to the noble Lafayette.\n\nMy conduct and my letters apparently gave satisfaction. Soon after I\nreached the coast of Spain I received from my uncle a letter full of\nkindly exhortations, and of mild censure for my abrupt departure. He\ngave me a father's blessing, and declared on his honour that the fief\nof Roche-Mauprat would never be accepted by Edmee, and sent me a\nconsiderable sum of money exclusive of the income due me in the future.\nThe abbe expressed the same mild censure, together with still warmer\nexhortations. It was easy to see that he preferred Edmee's tranquility\nto my happiness, and that he was full of genuine joy at my departure.\nNevertheless he had a liking for me, and his friendship showed itself\ntouchingly through the cruel satisfaction that was mingled with it. He\nexpressed envy of my lot; proclaimed his enthusiasm for the cause of\nindependence; and declared that he himself had more than once felt\ntempted to throw off the cassock and take up the musket. All this,\nhowever, was mere boyish affectation; his timid, gentle nature always\nkept him the priest under the mask of the philosopher.\n\nBetween these two letters I found a little note without any address,\nwhich seemed as if it had been slipped in as an after-thought. I was not\nslow to see that it was from the one person in the world who was of real\ninterest to me. Yet I had not the courage to open it. I walked up and\ndown the sandy beach, turning over this little piece of paper in my\nhands, fearful that by reading it I might destroy the kind of desperate\ncalm my resolution had given me. Above all, I dreaded lest it might\ncontain expressions of thanks and enthusiastic joy, behind which I\nshould have divined the rapture of contented love for another.\n\n\"What can she be writing to me about?\" I said to myself. \"Why does she\nwrite at all? I do not want her pity, still less her gratitude.\"\n\nI felt tempted to throw this fateful little note into the sea. Once,\nindeed I held it out over the waves, but I immediately pressed it to\nmy bosom, and kept it hidden there a few moments as if I had been a\nbeliever in that second sight preached by the advocates of magnetism,\nwho assert that they can read with the organs of feeling and thought as\nwell as with their eyes.\n\nAt last I resolved to break the seal. The words I read were these:\n\n\"You have done well, Bernard; but I give you no thanks, as your absence\nwill cause me more suffering than I can tell. Still, go wherever honour\nand love of truth call you; you will always be followed by my good\nwishes and prayers. Return when your mission is accomplished; you will\nfind me neither married nor in a convent.\"\n\nIn this note she had inclosed the cornelian ring she had given me during\nmy illness and which I had returned on leaving Paris. I had a little\ngold box made to hold this ring and note, and I wore it near my heart as\na talisman. Lafayette, who had been arrested in France by order of the\nGovernment, which was opposed to his expedition, soon came and joined us\nafter escaping from prison. I had had time to make my preparations, and\nI sailed full of melancholy, ambition, and hope.\n\nYou will not expect me to give an account of the American war. Once\nagain I will separate my existence from the events of history as I\nrelate my own adventures. Here, however, I shall suppress even my\npersonal adventures; in my memory these form a special chapter in which\nEdmee plays the part of a Madonna, constantly invoked but invisible. I\ncannot think that you would be the least interested in listening to a\nportion of my narrative from which this angelic figure, the only one\nworthy of your attention, firstly by reason of her own worth, and then\nfrom her influence on myself, was entirely absent. I will only state\nthat from the humble position which I gladly accepted in the beginning\nin Washington's army, I rose regularly but rapidly to the rank of\nofficer. My military education did not take long. Into this, as into\neverything that I have undertaken during my life, I put my whole soul,\nand through the pertinacity of my will I overcame all obstacles.\n\nI won the confidence of my illustrious chiefs. My excellent constitution\nfitted me well for the hardships of war; my old brigand habits too were\nof immense service to me; I endured reverses with a calmness beyond the\nreach of most of the young Frenchmen who had embarked with me, however\nbrilliant their courage might otherwise have been. My own was cool\nand tenacious, to the great surprise of our allies, who more than once\ndoubted my origin, on seeing how quickly I made myself at home in the\nforests, and how often my cunning and suspiciousness made me a match for\nthe savages who sometimes harassed our manoeuvres.\n\nIn the midst of my labours and frequent changes of place I was fortunate\nenough to be able to cultivate my mind through my intimacy with a young\nman of merit whom Providence sent me as a companion and friend. Love\nof the natural sciences had decided him to join our expedition, and he\nnever failed to show himself a good soldier; but it was easy to see that\npolitical sympathy had played only a secondary part in his decision.\nHe had no desire for promotion, no aptitude for strategic studies. His\nherbarium and his zoological occupations engaged his thoughts much more\nthan the successes of the war and the triumph of liberty. He fought too\nwell, when occasion arose, to ever deserve the reproach of lukewarmness;\nbut up to the eve of a fight and from the morrow he seemed to have\nforgotten that he was engaged in anything beyond a scientific expedition\ninto the wilds of the New World. His trunk was always full, not of money\nand valuables, but of natural history specimens; and while we were lying\non the grass on the alert for the least noise which might reveal the\napproach of the enemy, he would be absorbed in the analysis of some\nplant or insect. He was an admirable young man, as pure as an angel, as\nunselfish as a stoic, as patient as a savant, and withal cheerful and\naffectionate. When we were in danger of being surprised, he could think\nand talk of nothing but the precious pebbles and the invaluable bits\nof grass that he had collected and classified; and yet were one of us\nwounded, he would nurse him with a kindness and zeal that none could\nsurpass.\n\nOne day he noticed my gold box as I was putting it in my bosom, and he\nimmediately begged me to let him have it, to keep a few flies' legs and\ngrasshoppers' wings which he would have defended with the last drop of\nhis blood. It needed all the reverence I had for the relics of my love\nto resist the demands of friendship. All he could obtain from me was\npermission to hide away a very pretty little plant in my precious box.\nThis plant, which he declared he was the first to discover, was allowed\na home by the side of my _fiancee's_ ring and note only on condition\nthat it should be called Edmunda sylvestris; to this he consented. He\nhad given the name of Samuel Adams to a beautiful wild apple-tree;\nhe had christened some industrious bee or other Franklin; and nothing\npleased him more than to associate some honoured name with his ingenious\nobservations.\n\nThe attachment I felt for him was all the more genuine from its being my\nfirst friendship with a man of my own age. The pleasure which I derived\nfrom this intimacy gave me a new insight into life, and revealed\ncapacities and needs of the soul of which I had hitherto been ignorant.\nAs I could never wholly break away from that love of chivalry which had\nbeen implanted in me in early childhood, it pleased me to look upon him\nas my \"brother in arms,\" and I expressed a wish that he would give me\nthis special title too, to the exclusion of every other intimate friend.\nHe caught at the idea with a gladness of heart that showed me how lively\nwas the sympathy between us. He declared that I was a born naturalist,\nbecause I was so fitted for a roving life and rough expeditions.\nSometimes he would reproach me with absent-mindedness, and scold me\nseriously for carelessly stepping upon interesting plants, but he would\nassert that I was endowed with a sense of method, and that some day\nI might invent, not a theory of nature, but an excellent system of\nclassification. His prophecy was never fulfilled, but his encouragement\naroused a taste for study in me, and prevented my mind from being wholly\nparalyzed by camp life. To me he was as a messenger from heaven;\nwithout him I should perhaps have become, if not the Hamstringer of\nRoche-Mauprat, at all events the savage of Varenne again. His teachings\nrevived in me the consciousness of intellectual life. He enlarged\nmy ideas and also ennobled my instincts; for, though his marvellous\nintegrity and his modest disposition prevented him from throwing himself\ninto philosophical discussions, he had an innate love of justice, and he\njudged all questions of sentiment and morality with unerring wisdom.\nHe acquired an ascendency over me which the abbe had never been able to\nacquire, owing to the attitude of mutual distrust in which we had been\nplaced from the beginning. He revealed to me the wonders of a large part\nof the physical world, but what he taught me of chiefest value was to\nlearn to know myself, and to ponder over my own impressions. I succeeded\nin controlling my impulses up to a certain point. I could never subdue\nmy pride and violent temper. A man cannot change the essence of his\nnature, but he can guide his divers faculties towards a right path; he\ncan almost succeed in turning his faults to account--and this, indeed,\nis the great secret and the great problem of education.\n\nThe conversations with my friend Arthur led me into such a train of\nthought that from my recollections of Edmee's conduct I came to deduce\nlogically the motives which must have inspired it. I found her noble\nand generous, especially in those matters which, owing to my distorted\nvision and false judgment, had caused me most pain. I did not love her\nthe more for this--that would have been impossible--but I succeeded in\nunderstanding why I loved her with an unconquerable love in spite of\nall she had made me suffer. This sacred fire burned in my soul\nwithout growing dim for one instant during the whole six years of our\nseparation. In spite of the rich vitality which pulsed through my veins;\nin spite of the promptings of an external nature full of voluptuousness;\nin spite of the bad examples and numerous opportunities which tempted\nmortal weakness in the freedom of a roving, military life, I call God\nto witness that I preserved my robe of innocence undefiled, and that I\nnever felt the kiss of a woman. Arthur, whose calmer organization was\nless susceptible to temptation, and who, moreover, was almost entirely\nengrossed in intellectual labour, did not always practise the same\nausterity; nay, he frequently advised me not to run the risk of an\nexceptional life, contrary to the demands of Nature. When I confided to\nhim that a master-passion removed all weaknesses from my path and made\na fall impossible, he ceased to reason against what he called\nmy fanaticism (this was a word very much in vogue and applied\nindiscriminately to almost everything). I observed, indeed, that he had\na more profound esteem for me, I may even say a sort of respect which\ndid not express itself in words, but which was revealed by a thousand\nlittle signs of compliance and deference.\n\nOne day, when he was speaking of the great power exercised by gentleness\nof manners in alliance with a resolute will, citing both good and bad\nexamples from the history of men, especially the gentleness of the\napostles and the hypocrisy of the priests of all religions, it came into\nmy mind to ask him if, with my headstrong nature and hasty temper, I\nshould ever be able to exercise any influence on my fellows. When I used\nthis last word I was, of course, thinking only of Edmee. Arthur replied\nthat the influence which I exercised would be other than that of studied\ngentleness.\n\n\"Your influence,\" he said, \"will be due to your natural goodness of\nheart. Warmth of soul, ardour and perseverance in affection, these are\nwhat are needed in family life, and these qualities make our defects\nloved even by those who have to suffer from them most. We should\nendeavour, therefore, to master ourselves out of love for those who\nlove us; but to propose to one's self a system of moderation in the\nmost intimate concerns of love and friendship would, in my opinion, be\na childish task, a work of egotism which would kill all affection, in\nourselves first, and soon afterwards in the others. I was speaking of\nstudied moderation only in the exercise of authority over the masses.\nNow, should your ambition ever . . .\"\n\n\"You believe, then,\" I said, without listening to the last part of his\nspeech, \"that, such as I am, I might make a woman happy and force her to\nlove me, in spite of all my faults and the harm they cause?\"\n\n\"O lovelorn brain!\" he exclaimed. \"How difficult it is to distract your\nthoughts! . . . Well, if you wish to know, Bernard, I will tell you what\nI think of your love-affair. The person you love so ardently loves you,\nunless she is incapable of love or quite bereft of judgment.\"\n\nI assured him that she was as much above all other women as the lion\nis above the squirrel, the cedar above the hyssop, and with the help of\nmetaphors I succeeded in convincing him. Then he persuaded me to tell\nhim a few details, in order, as he said, that he might judge of my\nposition with regard to Edmee. I opened my heart without reserve, and\ntold him my history from beginning to end. At this time we were on the\noutskirts of a beautiful forest in the last rays of the setting sun. The\npark at Sainte-Severe, with its fine lordly oaks which had never known\nthe insult of an axe, came into my thoughts as I gazed on these trees of\nthe wilds, exempt from all human care, towering out above our heads in\ntheir might and primitive grace. The glowing horizon reminded me of the\nevening visits to Patience's hut, and Edmee sitting under the golden\nvine-leaves, and the notes of the merry parrots brought back to me the\nwarbling of the beautiful exotic birds she used to keep in her room.\nI wept as I thought of the land of my birth so far away, of the broad\nocean between us which had swallowed so many pilgrims in the hour of\ntheir return to their native shores. I also thought of the prospects of\nfortune, of the dangers of war, and for the first time I felt the fear\nof death; for Arthur, pressing my hand in his, assured me that I was\nloved, and that in each act of harshness or distrust he found but a new\nproof of affection.\n\n\"My boy,\" he said, \"cannot you see that if she did not want to marry\nyou, she would have found a hundred ways of ridding herself of your\npretensions forever? And if she had not felt an inexhaustible affection\nfor you, would she have taken so much trouble, and imposed so many\nsacrifices upon herself to raise you from the abject condition in which\nshe found you, and make you worthy of her? Well, you are always dreaming\nof the mighty deeds of the knight-errants of old: cannot you see that\nyou are a noble knight condemned by your lady to rude trials for having\nfailed in the laws of gallantry, for having demanded in an imperious\ntone the love which ought to be sued for on bended knee?\"\n\nHe then entered into a detailed examination of my misdeeds, and found\nthat the chastisement was severe but just. Afterwards he discussed the\nprobabilities of the future, and very sensibly advised me to submit\nuntil she thought right to pardon me.\n\n\"But,\" I said, \"is there no shame in a man ripened, as I am now, by\nreflection, and roughly tried by war, submitting like a child to the\ncaprices of a woman?\"\n\n\"No,\" replied Arthur, \"there is no shame in that; and the conduct of\nthis woman is not dictated by caprice. One can win nothing but honour in\nrepairing any evil one has done; and how few men are capable of it!\nIt is only just that offended modesty should claim its rights and its\nnatural independence. You have behaved like Albion; do not be astonished\nthat Edmee behaves like Philadelphia. She will not yield, except on\ncondition of a glorious peace, and she is right.\"\n\nHe wished to know how she had treated me during the two years we had\nbeen in America. I showed him the few short letters I had received from\nher. He was struck by the good sense and perfect integrity which seemed\nmanifested in their lofty tone and manly precision. In them Edmee had\nmade me no promise, nor had she even encouraged me by holding out any\ndirect hopes; but she had displayed a lively desire for my return, and\nhad spoken of the happiness we should all enjoy when, as we sat around\nthe fire, I should while away the evenings at the chateau with accounts\nof my wonderful adventures; and she had not hesitated to tell me that,\ntogether with her father, I was the one object of her solicitude\nin life. Yet, in spite of this never-failing tenderness, a terrible\nsuspicion harassed me. In these short letters from my cousin, as in\nthose from her father and in the long, florid and affectionate epistles\nfrom the Abbe Aubert, they never gave me any news of the events which\nmight be, and ought to be, taking place in the family. Each spoke of\nhis or her own self and never mentioned the others; or at most they\nonly spoke of the chevalier's attacks of the gout. It was as though an\nagreement had been made between the three that none should talk about\nthe occupations and state of mind of the other two.\n\n\"Shed light and ease my mind on this matter if you can,\" I said to\nArthur. \"There are moments when I fancy that Edmee must be married, and\nthat they have agreed not to inform me until I return, and what is to\nprevent this, in fact? Is it probable that she likes me enough to live\na life of solitude out of love for me, when this very love, in obedience\nto the dictation of a cold reason and an austere conscience, can resign\nitself to seeing my absence indefinitely prolonged with the war? I have\nduties to perform here, no doubt; honour demands that I should defend my\nflag until the day of the triumph or the irreparable defeat of the cause\nI serve; but I feel that Edmee is dearer to me than these empty honours,\nand that to see her but one hour sooner I would leave my name to the\nridicule or the curses of the world.\"\n\n\"This last thought,\" replied Arthur, with a smile, \"is suggested to you\nby the violence of your passion; but you would not act as you say, even\nif the opportunity occurred. When we are grappling with a single one of\nour faculties we fancy the others annihilated; but let some extraneous\nshock arouse them, and we realize that our soul draws its life from\nseveral sources at the same time. You are not insensible to fame,\nBernard; and if Edmee invited you to abandon it you would perceive\nthat it was dearer to you than you thought. You have ardent republican\nconvictions, and Edmee herself was the first to inspire you with them.\nWhat, then, would you think of her, and, indeed, what sort of woman\nwould she be, if she said to you to-day, 'There is something more\nimportant than the religion I preached to you and the gods I revealed;\nsomething more august and more sacred, and that is my own good\npleasure'? Bernard, your love is full of contradictory desires.\nInconsistency, moreover, is the mark of all human loves. Men imagine\nthat a woman can have no separate existence of her own, and that she\nmust always be wrapped up in them; and yet the only woman they love\ndeeply is she whose character seems to raise her above the weakness\nand indolence of her sex. You see how all the settlers in this country\ndispose of the beauty of their slaves, but they have no love for them,\nhowever beautiful they may be; and if by chance they become genuinely\nattached to one of them, their first care is to set her free. Until then\nthey do not think that they are dealing with a human being. A spirit\nof independence, the conception of virtue, a love of duty, all these\nprivileges of lofty souls are essential, therefore, in the woman who\nis to be one's companion through life; and the more your mistress gives\nproof of strength and patience, the more you cherish her, in spite of\nwhat you may have to suffer. You must learn, then, to distinguish love\nfrom desire; desire wishes to break through the very impediments by\nwhich it is attracted, and it dies amid the ruins of the virtue it has\nvanquished; love wishes to live, and in order to do that, it would fain\nsee the object of its worship long defended by that wall of adamant\nwhose strength and splendour mean true worth and true beauty.\"\n\nIn this way would Arthur explain to me the mysterious springs of my\npassion, and throw the light of his wisdom upon the stormy abyss of my\nsoul. Sometimes he used to add:\n\n\"If Heaven had granted me the woman I have now and then dreamed of, I\nthink I should have succeeded in making a noble and generous passion of\nmy love; but science has asked for too much of my time. I have not had\nleisure to look for my ideal; and if perchance it has crossed my path,\nI have not been able either to study it or recognise it. You have been\nfortunate, Bernard, but then, you do not sound the deeps of natural\nhistory; one man cannot have everything.\"\n\nAs to my suspicions about Edmee's marriage, he rejected them with\ncontempt as morbid fancies. To him, indeed, Edmee's silence showed an\nadmirable delicacy of feeling and conduct.\n\n\"A vain person,\" he said, \"would take care to let you know all the\nsacrifices she had made on your account, and would enumerate the titles\nand qualities of the suitors she had refused. Edmee, however, has too\nnoble a soul, too serious a mind, to enter into these futile details.\nShe looks upon your covenant as inviolable, and does not imitate those\nweak consciences which are always talking of their victories, and making\na merit of doing that in which true strength finds no difficulty. She is\nso faithful by nature that she never imagines that any one can suspect\nher of being otherwise.\"\n\nThese talks poured healing balm on my wounds. When at last France openly\ndeclared herself an ally of America, I received a piece of news from the\nabbe that entirely set my mind at ease on one point. He wrote to me that\nI should probably meet an old friend again in the New World; the Count\nde la Marche had been given command of a regiment, and was setting out\nfor the United States.\n\n\"And between ourselves,\" added the abbe, \"it is quite time that he made\na position for himself. This young man, though modest and steady, has\nalways been weak enough to yield to the prejudices of noble birth. He\nhas been ashamed of his poverty, and has tried to hide it as one hides\na leprosy. The result is that his efforts to prevent others from seeing\nthe progress of his ruin, have now ruined him completely. Society\nattributes the rupture between Edmee and him to these reverses of\nfortune; and people even go so far as to say that he was but little\nin love with her person, and very much with her dowry. I cannot bring\nmyself to credit him with contemptible views; and I can only think that\nhe is suffering those mortifications which arise from a false estimate\nof the value of the good things of this world. If you happen to meet\nhim, Edmee wishes you to show him some friendship, and to let him\nknow how great an interest she has always taken in him. Your excellent\ncousin's conduct in this matter, as in all others, has been full of\nkindness and dignity.\"\n\n\n\n\nXV\n\nOne the eve of M. de la Marche's departure, and after the abbe's letter\nhad been sent, a little incident had happened in Varenne which, when I\nheard of it in America, caused me considerable surprise and pleasure.\nMoreover, it is linked in a remarkable manner with the most important\nevents of my life, as you will see later.\n\nAlthough rather seriously wounded in the unfortunate affair of Savannah,\nI was actively engaged in Virginia, under General Greene, in collecting\nthe remains of the army commanded by Gates, whom I considered a much\ngreater hero than his more fortunate rival, Washington. We had just\nlearnt of the landing of M. de Ternay's squadron, and the depression\nwhich had fallen on us at this period of reverses and distress was\nbeginning to vanish before the prospect of re-enforcements. These, as\na fact, were less considerable than we had expected. I was strolling\nthrough the woods with Arthur, a short distance from the camp, and we\nwere taking advantage of this short respite to have a talk about other\nmatters than Cornwallis and the infamous Arnold. Long saddened by\nthe sight of the woes of the American nation, by the fear of seeing\ninjustice and cupidity triumphing over the cause of the people, we were\nseeking relief in a measure of gaiety. When I had an hour's leisure I\nused to escape from my stern toils to the oasis of my own thoughts in\nthe family at Sainte-Severe. At such a time I was wont to tell my kind\nfriend Arthur some of the comic incidents of my entry into life after\nleaving Roche-Mauprat. At one time I would give him a description of\nthe costume in which I first appeared; at another I would describe\nMademoiselle Leblanc's contempt and loathing for my person, and her\nrecommendation to her friend Saint-Jean never to approach within arms'\nlength of me. As I thought of these amusing individuals, the face of\nthe solemn hidalgo, Marcasse, somehow arose in my memory, and I began\nto give a faithful and detailed picture of the dress, and bearing, and\nconversation of this enigmatic personage. Not that Marcasse was actually\nas comic as he appeared to be in my imagination; but at twenty a man is\nonly a boy, especially when he is a soldier and has just escaped great\ndangers, and so is filled with careless pride at the conquest of his own\nlife. Arthur would laugh right heartily as he listened to me, declaring\nthat he would give his whole collection of specimens for such a curious\nanimal as I had just described. The pleasure he derived from my childish\nchatter increased my vivacity, and I do not know whether I should\nhave been able to resist the temptation to exaggerate my uncle's\npeculiarities, when suddenly at a turn in our path we found ourselves\nin the presence of a tall man, poorly dressed, and terribly haggard, who\nwas walking towards us with a serious pensive expression, and carrying\nin his hand a long naked sword, the point of which was peacefully\nlowered to the ground. This individual bore such a strong resemblance\nto the one I had just described to Arthur, struck by the parallel,\nburst into uncontrollable laughter, and moving aside to make way for\nMarcasse's double, threw himself upon the grass in a convulsive fit of\ncoughing.\n\nFor myself, I was far from laughing; for nothing that has a supernatural\nair about it fails to produce a vivid impression even on the man most\naccustomed to dangers. With staring eyes and outstretched arms we drew\nnear to each other, myself and he, not the shade of Marcasse, but\nthe venerable person himself, in flesh and blood, of the hidalgo\nmole-catcher.\n\nPetrified with astonishment when I saw what I had taken for his ghost\nslowly carry his hand to the corner of his hat and raise it without\nbending the fraction of an inch, I started back a yard or two; and this\nmovement, which Arthur thought was a joke on my part, only increased his\nmerriment. The weasel-hunter was by no means disconcerted; perhaps in\nhis judicial gravity he was thinking that this was the usual way to\ngreet people on the other side of the ocean.\n\nBut Arthur's laughter almost proved infectious when Marcasse said to me\nwith incomparable gravity:\n\n\"Monsieur Bernard, I have had the honour of searching for you for a long\ntime.\"\n\n\"For a long time, in truth, my good Marcasse,\" I replied, as I shook my\nold friend's hand with delight. \"But, tell me by what strange power I\nhave been lucky enough to draw you hither. In the old days you passed\nfor a sorcerer; is it possible that I have become one too without\nknowing it?\"\n\n\"I will explain all that, my dear general,\" answered Marcasse, who was\napparently dazzled by my captain's uniform. \"If you will allow me to\naccompany you I will tell you many things--many things!\"\n\nOn hearing Marcasse repeat his words in a low voice, as if furnishing an\necho for himself, a habit which only a minute before I was in the act of\nimitating, Arthur burst out laughing again. Marcasse turned toward\nhim and after surveying him intently bowed with imperturbable gravity.\nArthur, suddenly recovering his serious mood, rose and, with comic\ndignity, bowed in return almost to the ground.\n\nWe returned to the camp together. On the way Marcasse told me his story\nin that brief style of his, which, as it forced his hearer to ask a\nthousand wearisome questions, far from simplifying his narrative, made\nit extraordinarily complicated. It afforded Arthur great amusement; but\nas you would not derive the same pleasure from listening to an exact\nreproduction of this interminable dialogue, I will limit myself to\ntelling you how Marcasse had come to leave his country and his friends,\nin order to give the American cause the help of his sword.\n\nM. de la Marche happened to be setting out for America at the very time\nwhen Marcasse came to his castle in Berry for a week, to make his\nannual round among the beams and joists in the barns. The inmates of\nthe chateau, in their excitement at the count's departure, indulged\nin wonderful commentaries on that far country, so full of dangers and\nmarvels, from which, according to the village wiseacres, no man ever\nreturned without a vast fortune, and so many gold and silver ingots that\nhe needed ten ships to carry them all. Now, under his icy exterior,\nDon Marcasse, like some hyperborean volcano, concealed a glowing\nimagination, a passionate love of the marvellous. Accustomed to live in\na state of equilibrium on narrow beams in evidently loftier regions than\nother men, and not insensible to the glory of astounding the bystanders\nevery day by the calm daring of his acrobatic movements, he let himself\nbe fired by these pictures of Eldorado; and his dreams were the more\nextravagant because, as usual, he unbosomed himself to no one. M. de\nla Marche, therefore, was very much surprised when, on the eve of his\ndeparture, Marcasse presented himself, and proposed to accompany him to\nAmerica as his valet. In vain did M. de la Marche remind him that he was\nvery old to abandon his calling and run the risks of a new kind of life.\nMarcasse displayed so much firmness that in the end he gained his point.\nVarious reasons led M. de la Marche to consent to the strange request.\nHe had resolved to take with him a servant older still than the\nweasel-hunter, a man who was accompanying him only with great\nreluctance. But this man enjoyed his entire confidence, a favour which\nM. de la Marche was very slow to grant, since he was only able to\nkeep up the outward show of a man of quality, and wished to be served\nfaithfully, and with economy and prudence. He knew, however, that\nMarcasse was scrupulously honest, and even singularly unselfish; for\nthere was something of Don Quixote in the man's soul as well as in his\nappearance. He had found in some ruins a sort of treasure-trove, that is\nto say, an earthenware jar containing a sum of about ten thousand francs\nin old gold and silver coins; and not only had he handed it over to the\nowner of the ruins, whom he might easily have deceived, but further\nhe had refused to accept any reward, declaring emphatically in his\nabbreviated jargon, \"honesty would die selling itself.\"\n\nMarcasse's economy, his discretion, his punctuality, seemed likely to\nmake him a valuable man, if he could be trained to put these qualities\nat the service of others. The one thing to be feared was that he might\nnot be able to accustom himself to his loss of independence. However,\nM. de la Marche thought that, before M. de Ternay's squadron sailed, he\nwould have time to test his new squire sufficiently.\n\nOn his side, Marcasse felt many regrets at taking leave of his friends\nand home; for if he had \"friends everywhere and everywhere a native\nplace,\" as he said, in allusion to his wandering life, he still had a\nvery marked preference for Varenne; and of all his castles (for he was\naccustomed to call every place he stopped at \"his\"), the chateau of\nSainte-Severe was the only one which he arrived at with pleasure and\nleft with regret. One day, when he had missed his footing on the roof\nand had rather a serious fall, Edmee, then still a child, had won his\nheart by the tears she had shed over this accident, and the artless\nattentions she had shown him. And ever since Patience had come to dwell\non the edge of the park, Marcasse had felt still more attracted toward\nSainte-Severe; for in Patience Marcasse had found his Orestes. Marcasse\ndid not always understand Patience; but Patience was the only man who\nthoroughly understood Marcasse, and who knew how much chivalrous honesty\nand noble courage lay hidden beneath that odd exterior. Humbly bowing\nto the hermit's intellectual superiority, the weasel-hunter would stop\nrespectfully whenever the poetic frenzy took possession of Patience and\nmade his words unintelligible. At such a time Marcasse would refrain\nfrom questions and ill-timed remarks with touching gentleness; would\nlower his eyes, and nodding his head from time to time as if he\nunderstood and approved, would, at least, afford his friend the innocent\npleasure of being listened to without contradiction.\n\nMarcasse, however, had understood enough to make him embrace republican\nideas and share in those romantic hopes of universal levelling and a\nreturn to the golden age, which had been so ardently fostered by old\nPatience. Having frequently heard his friend say that these doctrines\nwere to be cultivated with prudence (a precept, however, to which\nPatience gave but little heed himself), the hidalgo, inclined to\nreticence both by habit and inclination, never spoke of his philosophy;\nbut he proved himself a more efficacious propagandist by carrying about\nfrom castle to cottage, and from house to farm, those little cheap\neditions of _La Science du Bonhomme Richard_, and other small treatises\non popular patriotism, which, according to the Jesuits, a secret society\nof Voltairian philosophers, devoted to the diabolical practice of\nfreemasonry, circulated gratis among the lower classes.\n\nThus in Marcasse's sudden resolution there was as much revolutionary\nenthusiasm as love of adventure. For a long time the dormouse and\npolecat had seemed to him overfeeble enemies for his restless valour,\neven as the granary floor seemed to afford too narrow a field. Every\nday he read the papers of the previous day in the servants' hall of\nthe houses he visited; and it appeared to him that this war in America,\nwhich was hailed as the awakening of the spirit of justice and liberty\nin the New World, ought to produce a revolution in France. It is true\nhe had a very literal notion of the way in which ideas were to cross the\nseas and take possession of the minds of our continent. In his dreams he\nused to see an army of victorious Americans disembarking from numberless\nships, and bringing the olive branch of peace and the horn of plenty to\nthe French nation. In these same dreams he beheld himself at the head\nof a legion of heroes returning to Varenne as a warrior, a legislator, a\nrival of Washington, suppressing abuses, cutting down enormous fortunes,\nassigning to each proletarian a suitable share, and, in the midst of his\nfar-reaching and vigorous measures, protecting the good and fair-dealing\nnobles, and assuring an honourable existence to them. Needless to say,\nthe distress inseparable from all great political crises never entered\ninto Marcasse's mind, and not a single drop of blood sullied the\nromantic picture which Patience had unrolled before his eyes.\n\nFrom these sublime hopes to the role of valet to M. de la Marche was a\nfar cry; but Marcasse could reach his goal by no other way. The ranks\nof the army corps destined for America had long been filled, and it was\nonly in the character of a passenger attached to the expedition that\nhe could take his place on one of the merchant ships that followed the\nexpedition. He had questioned the abbe on these points without revealing\nhis plans. His departure quite staggered all the inhabitants of Varenne.\n\nNo sooner had he set foot on the shores of the States than he felt an\nirresistible inclination to take his big hat and his big sword and go\noff all alone through the woods, as he had been accustomed to do in his\nown country. His conscience, however, prevented him from quitting his\nmaster after having pledged himself to serve him. He had calculated that\nfortune would help him, and fortune did. The war proved much more bloody\nand vigorous than had been expected, and M. de la Marche feared, though\nwrongly, that he might be impeded by the poor health of his gaunt\nsquire. Having a suspicion, too, of the man's desire for liberty, he\noffered him a sum of money and some letters of recommendation, to enable\nhim to join the American troops as a volunteer. Marcasse, knowing the\nstate of his master's fortune, refused the money, and only accepted the\nletters; and then set off with as light a step as the nimblest weasels\nthat he had ever killed.\n\nHis intention was to make for Philadelphia; but, through a chance\noccurrence which I need not relate, he learnt that I was in the South,\nand, rightly calculating that he would obtain both advice and help from\nme, he had set out to find me, alone, on foot, through unknown countries\nalmost uninhabited and often full of danger of all kinds. His clothes\nalone had suffered; his yellow face had not changed its tint, and he was\nno more surprised at his latest exploit than if he had merely covered\nthe distance from Sainte-Severe to Gazeau Tower.\n\nThe only fresh habit that I noticed in him, was that he would turn round\nfrom time to time, and look behind him, as if he had felt inclined to\ncall some one; then immediately after he would smile and sigh almost at\nthe same instant. I could not resist a desire to ask him the cause of\nhis uneasiness.\n\n\"Alas!\" he replied, \"habit can't get rid of; a poor dog! good dog!\nAlways saying, 'Here Blaireau! Blaireau, here!'\"\n\n\"I understand,\" I said, \"Blaireau is dead, and you cannot accustom\nyourself to the idea that you will never see him at your heels again.\"\n\n\"Dead!\" he exclaimed, with an expression of horror. \"No, thank God!\nFriend Patience, great friend! Blaireau quite well off, but sad like his\nmaster; his master alone!\"\n\n\"If Blaireau is with Patience,\" said Arthur, \"he is well off, as you\nsay; for Patience wants nothing. Patience will love him because he loves\nhis master, and you are certain to see your good friend and faithful dog\nagain.\"\n\nMarcasse turned his eyes upon the individual who seemed to be so well\nacquainted with his life; but, feeling sure that he had never seen him\nbefore, he acted as he was wont to do when he did not understand; he\nraised his hat and bowed respectfully.\n\nOn my immediate recommendation Marcasse was enrolled in my company\nand, a little while afterward, was made a sergeant. The worthy man went\nthrough the whole campaign with me, and went through it bravely; and in\n1782, when I rejoined Rochambeau's army to fight under the French flag,\nhe followed me, as he was anxious to share my lot until the end. In the\nearly days I looked upon him rather as an amusement than a companion;\nbut his excellent conduct and calm fearlessness soon won for him the\nesteem of all, and I had reason to be proud of my _protege_. Arthur also\nconceived a great friendship for him; and, when off duty, he accompanied\nus in all our walks, carrying the naturalist's box and running the\nsnakes through with his sword.\n\nBut when I tried to make him speak of my cousin, he by no means\nsatisfied me. Whether he did not understand how eager I felt to learn\nall the details of the life she was leading far away from me, or\nwhether in this matter he was obeying one of those inviolable laws\nwhich governed his conscience, I could never obtain from him any clear\nsolution of the doubts which harassed me. Quite early he told me that\nthere was no question of her marriage with any one; but, accustomed\nthough I was to his vague manner of expressing himself, I imagined he\nseemed embarrassed in making this assertion and had the air of a man\nwho had sworn to keep a secret. Honour forbade me to insist to such an\nextent as to let him see my hopes, and so there always remained between\nus a painful point which I tried to avoid touching upon, but to which,\nin spite of myself, I was continually returning. As long as Arthur was\nnear me, I retained my reason, and interpreted Edmee's letters in the\nmost loyal way; but when I was unfortunate enough to be separated from\nhim, my sufferings revived, and my stay in America became more irksome\nto me every day.\n\nOur separation took place when I left the American army to fight\nunder the command of the French general. Arthur was an American; and,\nmoreover, he was only waiting for the end of the war to retire from the\nservice, and settle in Boston with Dr. Cooper, who loved him as his son,\nand who had undertaken to get him appointed principal librarian to the\nlibrary of the Philadelphia Society. This was all the reward Arthur\ndesired for his labours.\n\nThe events which filled my last years in America belong to history.\nIt was with a truly personal delight that I hailed the peace which\nproclaimed the United States a free nation. I had begun to chafe at my\nlong absence from France; my passion had been growing ever greater, and\nleft no room for the intoxication of military glory. Before my departure\nI went to take leave of Arthur. Then I sailed with the worthy Marcasse,\ndivided between sorrow at parting from my only friend, and joy at the\nprospect of once more seeing my only love. The squadron to which my ship\nbelonged experienced many vicissitudes during the passage, and several\ntimes I gave up all hope of ever kneeling before Edmee under the great\noaks of Sainte-Severe. At last, after a final storm off the coast of\nFrance, I set foot on the shores of Brittany, and fell into the arms\nof my poor sergeant, who had borne our common misfortunes, if not with\ngreater physical courage, at least with a calmer spirit, and we mingled\nour tears.\n\n\n\n\nXVI\n\nWe set out from Brest without sending any letter to announce our coming.\n\nWhen we arrived near Varenne we alighted from the post-chaise and,\nordering the driver to proceed by the longest road to Saint-Severe, took\na short cut through the woods. As soon as I saw the trees in the park\nraising their venerable heads above the copses like a solemn phalanx of\ndruids in the middle of a prostrate multitude, my heart began to beat so\nviolently that I was forced to stop.\n\n\"Well,\" said Marcasse, turning round with an almost stern expression, as\nif he would have reproached me for my weakness.\n\nBut a moment later I saw that his own face, too, was betraying\nunexpected emotion. A plaintive whining and a bushy tail brushing\nagainst his legs had made him start. He uttered a loud cry on seeing\nBlaireau. The poor animal had scented his master from afar, and had\nrushed forward with all the speed of his first youth to roll at his\nfeet. For a moment we thought he was going to die there, for he remained\nmotionless and convulsed, as it were, under Marcasse's caressing hand;\nthen suddenly he sprang up, as if struck with an idea worthy of a man,\nand set off with the speed of lightning in the direction of Patience's\nhut.\n\n\"Yes, go and tell my friend, good dog!\" exclaimed Marcasse; \"a better\nfriend than you would be more than man.\"\n\nHe turned towards me, and I saw two big tears trickling down the cheeks\nof the impassive hidalgo.\n\nWe hastened our steps till we reached the hut. It had undergone striking\nimprovements; a pretty rustic garden, inclosed by a quickset hedge with\na bank of stones behind, extended round the little house. The approach\nto this was no longer a rough little path, but a handsome walk, on\neither side of which splendid vegetables stretched out in regular rows,\nlike an army in marching order. The van was composed of a battalion of\ncabbages; carrots and lettuces formed the main body; and along the hedge\nsome modest sorrel brought up the rear. Beautiful apple-trees, already\nwell grown, spread their verdant shade above these plants; while\npear-trees, alternately standards and espaliers, with borders of thyme\nand sage kissing the feet of sunflowers and gilliflowers, convicted\nPatience of a strange return to ideas of social order, and even to a\ntaste for luxuries.\n\nThe change was so remarkable that I thought I should no longer find\nPatience in the cottage. A strange feeling of uneasiness began to come\nover me; my fear almost turned into certainty when I saw two young men\nfrom the village occupied in trimming the espaliers. Our passage had\nlasted more than four months, and it must have been quite six months\nsince we had had any news of the hermit. Marcasse, however, seemed to\nfeel no fear; Blaireau had told him plainly that Patience was alive,\nand the footmarks of the little dog, freshly printed in the sand of the\nwalk, showed the direction in which he had gone. Notwithstanding, I was\nso afraid of seeing a cloud come over the joy of this day, that I did\nnot dare to question the gardeners about Patience. Silently I followed\nthe hidalgo, whose eyes grew full of tears as they gazed upon this\nnew Eden, and whose prudent mouth let no sound escape save the word\n\"change,\" which he repeated several times.\n\nAt last I grew impatient; the walk seemed interminable, though very\nshort in reality, and I began to run, my heart beating wildly.\n\n\"Perhaps Edmee,\" I said to myself, \"is here!\"\n\nHowever, she was not there, and I could only hear the voice of the\nhermit saying:\n\n\"Now, then! What is the matter? Has the poor dog gone mad? Down,\nBlaireau! You would never have worried your master in this way. This is\nwhat comes of being too kind!\"\n\n\"Blaireau is not mad!\" I exclaimed, as I entered. \"Have you grown deaf\nto the approach of a friend, Master Patience?\"\n\nPatience, who was in the act of counting a pile of money, let it fall\non the table and came towards me with the old cordiality. I embraced him\nheartily; he was surprised and touched at my joy. Then he examined\nme from head to foot, and seemed to be wondering at the change in my\nappearance, when Marcasse arrived at the door.\n\nThen a sublime expression came over Patience's face, and lifting his\nstrong arms to heaven, he exclaimed:\n\n\"The words of the canticle! Now let me depart in peace; for mine eyes\nhave seen him I yearned for.\"\n\nThe hidalgo said nothing; he raised his hat as usual; then sitting down\nhe turned pale and shut his eyes. His dog jumped up on his knees and\ndisplayed his affection by attempts at little cries which changed into\na series of sneezes (you remember that he was born dumb). Trembling with\nold age and delight, he stretched out his pointed nose towards the long\nnose of his master; but his master did not respond with the customary\n\"Down, Blaireau!\"\n\nMarcasse had fainted.\n\nThis loving soul, no more able than Blaireau to express itself in words,\nhad sunk beneath the weight of his own happiness. Patience ran\nand fetched him a large mug of wine of the district, in its second\nyear--that is to say, the oldest and best possible. He made him swallow\na few drops; its strength revived him. The hidalgo excused his weakness\non the score of fatigue and the heat. He would not or could not assign\nit to its real sense. There are souls who die out, after burning with\nunsurpassable moral beauty and grandeur, without ever having found a\nway, and even without ever having felt the need, of revealing themselves\nto others.\n\nWhen Patience, who was as demonstrative as his friend was the contrary,\nhad recovered from his first transports, he turned to me and said:\n\n\"Now, my young officer, I see that you have no wish to remain here long.\nLet us make haste, then, to the place you are burning to reach. There is\nsome one who will be much surprised and much delighted, you may take my\nword.\"\n\nWe entered the park, and while crossing it, Patience explained the\nchange which had come over his habitation and his life.\n\n\"For myself,\" he said to me, \"you see that I have not changed. The same\nappearance, the same ways; and if I offered you some wine just now, that\ndoes not prevent me from drinking water myself. But I have money, and\nland, and workmen--yes, I have. Well, all this is in spite of myself,\nas you will see. Some three years ago Mademoiselle Edmee spoke of the\ndifficulty she had in bestowing alms so as to do real good. The abbe was\nas unskilful as herself. People would impose on them every day and use\ntheir money for bad ends; whereas proud and hard-working day-labourers\nmight be in a state of real distress without any one being able to\ndiscover the fact. She was afraid that if she inquired into their wants\nthey might take it as an insult; and when worthless fellows appealed to\nher she preferred being their dupe to erring against charity. In this\nmanner she used to give away a great deal of money and do very little\ngood. I then made her understand how money was the thing that was the\nleast necessary to the necessitous. I explained that men were really\nunfortunate, not when they were unable to dress better than their\nfellows, or go to the tavern on Sundays, or display at high-mass a\nspotlessly white stocking with a red garter above the knee, or talk\nabout 'My mare, my cow, my vine, my barn, etc.,' but rather when they\nwere afflicted with poor health and a bad season, when they could not\nprotect themselves against the cold, and heat and sickness, against\nthe pangs of hunger and thirst. I told her, then, not to judge of the\nstrength and health of peasants by myself, but to go in person and\ninquire into their illnesses and their wants.\n\n\"These folk are not philosophers,\" I said; \"they have their little\nvanities, they are fond of finery, spend the little they earn on cutting\na figure, and have not foresight enough to deprive themselves of a\npassing pleasure in order to lay by something against a day of real\nneed. In short, they do not know how to use their money; they tell you\nthey are in debt, and, though that may be true, it is not true that\nthey will use the money you give them to pay what they owe. They take no\nthought of the morrow; they will agree to as high a rate of interest as\nmay be asked, and with your money they will buy a hemp-field or a set\nof furniture so as to astonish their neighbours and make them jealous.\nMeanwhile their debts go on increasing year by year, and in the end they\nhave to sell their hemp-field and their furniture, because the creditor,\nwho is always one of themselves, calls for repayment or for more\ninterest than they can furnish. Everything goes; the principal takes all\ntheir capital, just as the interest has taken all their income. Then you\ngrow old and can work no longer; your children abandon you, because you\nhave brought them up badly, and because they have the same passions and\nthe same vanities as yourself. All you can do is to take a wallet and go\nfrom door to door to beg your bread, because you are used to bread and\nwould die if you had to live on roots like the sorcerer Patience, that\noutcast of Nature, whom everybody hates and despises because he has not\nbecome a beggar.\n\n\"The beggar, moreover, is hardly worse off than the day-labourer;\nprobably he is better off. He is no longer troubled with pride, whether\nestimable or foolish; he has no longer to suffer. The folks in his part\nof the country are good to him; there is not a beggar that wants for a\nbed or supper as he goes his round. The peasants load him with bits of\nbread, to such an extent that he has enough to feed both poultry and\npigs in the little hovel where he has left a child and an old mother to\nlook after his animals. Every week he returns there and spends two or\nthree days, doing nothing except counting the pennies that have been\ngiven him. These poor coins often serve to satisfy the superfluous wants\nwhich idleness breeds. A peasant rarely takes snuff; many beggars cannot\ndo without it; they ask for it more eagerly than for bread. So the\nbeggar is no more to be pitied than the labourer; but he is corrupt and\ndebauched, when he is not a scoundrel and a brute, which, in truth, is\nseldom enough.\n\n\"'This, then, is what ought to be done,' I said to Edmee; 'and the abbe\ntells me that this is also the idea of your philosophers. You who are\nalways ready to help the unfortunate, should give without consulting\nthe special fancies of the man who asks, but only after ascertaining his\nreal wants.'\n\n\"Edmee objected that it would be impossible for her to obtain the\nnecessary information; that she would have to give her whole time to\nit, and neglect the chevalier, who is growing old and can no longer read\nanything without his daughter's eyes and head. The abbe was too fond\nof improving his mind from the writings of the wise to have time for\nanything else.\n\n\"'That is what comes of all this study of virtue!' I said to her; 'it\nmakes a man forget to be virtuous.'\n\n\"'You are quite right,' answered Edmee; 'but what is to be done?'\n\n\"I promised to think it over; and this is how I went to work. Instead of\ntaking my walks as usual in the direction of the woods, I paid a visit\nevery day to the small holdings. It cost me a great effort; I like to be\nalone; and everywhere I had shunned my fellow-men for so many years that\nI had lost touch with them. However, this was a duty and I did it. I\nwent to various houses, and by way of conversation, first of all over\nhedges, and then inside the houses themselves, I made inquiries as to\nthose points which I wanted to learn. At first they gave me a welcome\nsuch as they would give to a lost dog in time of drought; and with a\nvexation I could scarce conceal I noticed the hatred and distrust on all\ntheir faces. Though I had not cared to live among other men, I still\nhad an affection for them; I knew that they were unfortunate rather than\nvicious; I had spent all my time in lamenting their woes and railing\nagainst those that caused them; and when for the first time I saw a\npossibility of doing something for some of them, these very men shut\ntheir doors the very moment they caught sight of me in the distance, and\ntheir children (those pretty children that I love so much!) would hide\nthemselves in ditches so as to escape the fever which, it was said, I\ncould give with a glance. However, as Edmee's friendship for me was\nwell known, they did not dare to repulse me openly, and I succeeded in\ngetting the information we wanted. Whenever I told her of any distress\nshe at once supplied a remedy. One house was full of cracks; and while\nthe daughter was wearing an apron of cotton-cloth at four francs an ell,\nthe rain was falling on the grandmother's bed and the little children's\ncradles. The roof and walls were repaired; we supplied the materials and\npaid the workmen; but no more money for gaudy aprons. In another case,\nan old woman had been reduced to beggary because she had listened too\nwell to her heart, and given all she had to her children, who had turned\nher out of doors, or made her life so unbearable that she preferred to\nbe a tramp. We took up the old woman's cause, and threatened that we\nwould bring the matter before the courts at our own expense. Thus\nwe obtained for her a pension, to which we added when it was not\nsufficient. We induced several old persons who were in a similar\nposition to combine and live together under the same roof. We chose one\nas head, and gave him a little capital, and as he was an industrious and\nmethodical man, he turned it to such profit that his children came\nand made their peace with him, and asked to be allowed to help in his\nestablishment.\n\n\"We did many other things besides; I need not give you details, as you\nwill see them yourself. I say 'we,' because, though I did not wish to\nbe concerned in anything beyond what I had already done, I was gradually\ndrawn on and obliged to do more and more, to concern myself with many\nthings, and finally with everything. In short, it is I who make the\ninvestigations, superintend the works, and conduct all negotiations.\nMademoiselle Edmee wished me to keep a sum of money by me, so that I\nmight dispose of it without consulting her first. This I have never\nallowed myself to do; and, moreover, she has never once opposed any of\nmy ideas. But all this, you know, has meant much work and many worries.\nEver since the people realized that I was a little Turgot they have\ngrovelled before me, and that has pained me not a little. And so I have\nvarious friends that I don't care for, and various enemies that I could\nwell do without. The sham poor owe me a grudge because I do not let\nmyself be duped by them; and there are perverse and worthless people\nwho think one is always doing too much for others, and never enough for\nthem. With all this bustle and all these bickerings, I can no longer\ntake my walk during the night, and my sleep during the day. I am now\nMonsieur Patience, and no longer the sorcerer of Gazeau Tower; but alas!\nI am a hermit no more; and, believe me, I would wish with all my heart\nthat I could have been born selfish, so that I might throw off my\nharness, and return to my savage life and my liberty.\"\n\nWhen Patience had given us this account of his work we complimented\nhim on it; but we ventured to express a doubt about his pretended\nself-sacrifice; this magnificent garden seemed to indicate a compromise\nwith \"those superfluous necessities,\" the use of which by others he had\nalways deplored.\n\n\"That?\" he said, waving his arm in the direction of his inclosure. \"That\ndoes not concern me; they made it against my wishes; but, as they were\nworthy folk and my refusal would have grieved them, I was obliged to\nallow it. You must know that, if I have stirred ingratitude in many\nhearts, I have also made a few happy ones grateful. So, two or three\nfamilies to whom I had done some service, tried all possible means to\ngive me pleasure in return; and, as I refused everything, they thought\nthey would give me a surprise. Once I had to pay a visit to Berthenoux\nfor several days, on some confidential business which had been entrusted\nto me; for people have come to imagine me a very clever man, so easy\nis it to pass from one extreme to another. On my return I found this\ngarden, marked out, planted and inclosed as you see it. In vain did I\nget angry, and explain that I did not want to work, that I was too old,\nand that the pleasure of eating a little more fruit was not worth the\ntrouble that this garden was going to cost me; they finished it without\nheeding what I said, and declared that I need not trouble in the least,\nbecause they would undertake to cultivate it for me. And, indeed, for\nthe last two years the good folk have not failed to come, now one and\nnow another, and give such time in each season as was necessary to keep\nit in perfect order. Besides, though I have altered nothing in my own\nways of living, the produce of this garden has been very useful; during\nthe winter I was able to feed several poor people with my vegetables;\nwhile my fruit has served to win the affection of the little children,\nwho no longer cry out 'wolf' when they see me, but have grown bold\nenough to come and kiss the sorcerer. Other people have forced me to\naccept presents of wine, and now and then of white bread, and cheeses\nof cow's milk. All these things, however, only enable me to be polite to\nthe village elders when they come and report the deserving cases of the\nplace, so that I may make them known at the castle. These honours have\nnot turned my head, as you see; nay, more, I may say that when I have\ndone about all that I have to do, I shall leave the cares of greatness\nbehind me, and return to my philosopher's life, perhaps to Gazeau\nTower--who knows?\"\n\nWe were now at the end of our walk. As I set foot on the steps of the\nchateau, I was suddenly filled with a feeling of devoutness; I\nclasped my hands and called upon Heaven in a sort of terror. A vague,\nindefinable fear arose in me; I imagined all manner of things that might\nhinder my happiness. I hesitated to cross the threshold of the house;\nthen I rushed forward. A mist came over my eyes, a buzzing filled my\nears. I met Saint-Jean, who, not recognising me, gave a loud cry and\nthrew himself in my path to prevent me from entering without being\nannounced. I pushed him aside, and he sank down astounded on one of the\nhall chairs while I hastened to the door of the drawing-room. But,\njust as I was about to throw it open, I was seized with a new fear and\nchecked myself; then I opened it so timidly that Edmee, who was occupied\nat some embroidery on a frame, did not raise her eyes, thinking that\nin this slight noise she recognised the respectful Saint-Jean. The\nchevalier was asleep and did not wake. This old man, tall and thin like\nall the Mauprats, was sitting with his head sunk on his breast; and his\npale, wrinkled face, which seemed already wrapped in the torpor of the\ngrave, resembled one of those angular heads in carved oak which adorned\nthe back of his big arm-chair. His feet were stretched out in front of a\nfire of dried vine-branches, although the sun was warm and a bright ray\nwas falling on his white head and making it shine like silver. And how\ncould I describe to you my feelings on beholding Edmee? She was bending\nover her tapestry and glancing from time to time at her father to notice\nhis slightest movements. But what patience and resignation were revealed\nin her whole attitude! Edmee was not fond of needlework; her mind was\ntoo vigorous to attach much importance to the effect of one shade by the\nside of another shade, and to the regularity of one stitch laid against\nanother stitch. Besides, the blood flowed swiftly in her veins, and when\nher mind was not absorbed in intellectual work she needed exercise in\nthe open air. But ever since her father, a prey to the infirmities of\nold age, had been almost unable to leave his arm-chair, she had refused\nto leave him for a single moment; and, since she could not always be\nreading and working her mind, she had felt the necessity of taking\nup some of those feminine occupations which, as she said, \"are the\namusements of captivity.\" She had conquered her nature then in truly\nheroic fashion. In one of those secret struggles which often take place\nunder our eyes without our suspecting the issue involved, she had done\nmore than subdue her nature, she had even changed the circulation of\nher blood. I found her thinner; and her complexion had lost that first\nfreshness of youth which, like the bloom that the breath of morning\nspreads over fruit, disappears at the slightest shock from without,\nalthough it may have been respected by the heat of the sun. Yet in this\npremature paleness and in this somewhat unhealthy thinness there seemed\nto be an indefinable charm; her eyes, more sunken, but inscrutable as\never, showed less pride and more melancholy than of old; her mouth\nhad become more mobile, and her smile was more delicate and less\ncontemptuous. When she spoke to me, I seemed to behold two persons in\nher, the old and the new; and I found that, so far from having lost her\nbeauty, she had attained ideal perfection. Still, I remember several\npersons at that time used to declare that she had \"changed very much,\"\nwhich with them meant that she had greatly deteriorated. Beauty,\nhowever, is like a temple in which the profane see naught but the\nexternal magnificence. The divine mystery of the artist's thought\nreveals itself only to profound sympathy, and the inspiration in each\ndetail of the sublime work remains unseen by the eyes of the vulgar. One\nof your modern authors, I fancy, has said this in other words and much\nbetter. As for myself, at no moment in her life did I find Edmee less\nbeautiful than at any other. Even in the hours of suffering, when beauty\nin its material sense seems obliterated, hers but assumed a divine\nform in my eyes, and in her face I beheld the splendour of a new moral\nbeauty. However, I am but indifferently endowed with artistic feeling,\nand had I been a painter, I could not have created more than a single\ntype, that which filled my whole soul; for in the course of my long life\nonly one woman has seemed to me really beautiful; and that woman was\nEdmee.\n\nFor a few seconds I stood looking at her, so touchingly pale, sad yet\ncalm, a living image of filial piety, of power in thrall to affection.\nThen I rushed forward and fell at her feet without being able to say a\nword. She uttered no cry, no exclamation of surprise, but took my head\nin her two arms and held it for some time pressed to her bosom. In this\nstrong pressure, in this silent joy I recognised the blood of my race,\nI felt the touch of a sister. The good chevalier, who had waked with a\nstart, stared at us in astonishment, his body bent forward and his elbow\nresting on his knee; then he said:\n\n\"Well, well! What is the meaning of this?\"\n\nHe could not see my face, hidden as it was in Edmee's breast. She pushed\nme towards him; and the old man clasped me in his feeble arms with a\nburst of generous affection that gave him back for a moment the vigour\nof youth.\n\nI leave you to imagine the questions with which I was overwhelmed, and\nthe attentions that were lavished on me. Edmee was a veritable mother\nto me. Her unaffected kindness and confidence savoured so much of heaven\nthat throughout the day I could not think of her otherwise than if I had\nreally been her son.\n\nI was very much touched at the pleasure they took in preparing a big\nsurprise for the abbe; I saw in this a sure proof of the delight he\nwould feel at my return. They made me hide under Edmee's frame, and\ncovered me with the large green cloth that was generally thrown over her\nwork. The abbe sat down quite close to me, and I gave a shout and seized\nhim by the legs. This was a little practical joke that I used to play\non him in the old days. When, throwing aside the frame, and sending the\nballs of wool rolling over the floor, I came out from my hiding-place,\nthe expression of terror and delight on his face was most quaint.\n\nBut I will spare you all these family scenes to which my memory goes\nback too readily.\n\n\n\n\nXVII\n\nAn immense change had taken place in me during the course of six years.\nI had become a man very much like other men; my instincts had managed to\nbring themselves into harmony with my affections, my intuitions with my\nreason. This social education had been carried on quite naturally; all\nI had to do was to accept the lessons of experience and the counsels of\nfriendship. I was far from being a learned man; but I had developed a\npower of acquiring solid learning very rapidly. My notions of things in\ngeneral were as clear as could be obtained at that time. Since then I\nknow that real progress has been made in human knowledge; I have watched\nit from afar and have never thought of denying it. And as I notice that\nnot all men of my age show themselves as reasonable, it pleases me to\nthink that I was put on a fairly right road early in life, since I have\nnever stopped in the blind alley of errors and prejudices.\n\nThe progress I had made intellectually seemed to satisfy Edmee.\n\n\"I am not astonished at it,\" she said. \"I could see it in your letters;\nbut I rejoice at it with a mother's pride.\"\n\nMy good uncle was no longer strong enough to engage in the old stormy\ndiscussions; and I really think that if he had retained his strength\nhe would have been somewhat grieved to find that I was no longer the\nindefatigable opponent who had formerly irritated him so persistently.\nHe even made a few attempts at contradiction to test me; but at this\ntime I should have considered it a crime to have gratified him. He\nshowed a little temper at this, and seemed to think that I treated him\ntoo much as an old man. To console him I turned the conversation to the\nhistory of the past, to the years through which he himself had lived,\nand questioned him on many points wherein his experience served him\nbetter than my knowledge. In this way I obtained many healthy notions\nfor the guidance of my own conduct, and at the same time I fully\nsatisfied his legitimate _amour propre_. He now conceived a friendship\nfor me from genuine sympathy, just as formerly he had adopted me from\nnatural generosity and family pride. He did not disguise from me that\nhis great desire, before falling into the sleep that knows no waking,\nwas to see me married to Edmee; and when I told him that this was the\none thought of my life, the one wish of my soul, he said:\n\n\"I know, I know. Everything depends on her, and I think she can no\nlonger have any reasons for hesitation. . . . At all events,\" he added,\nafter a moment's silence and with a touch of peevishness, \"I cannot see\nany that she could allege at present.\"\n\nFrom these words, the first he had ever uttered on the subject which\nmost interested me, I concluded that he himself had long been favourable\nto my suit, and that the obstacle, if one still existed, lay with Edmee.\nMy uncle's last remark implied a doubt which I dared not try to clear\nup, and which caused me great uneasiness. Edmee's sensitive pride\ninspired me with such awe, her unspeakable goodness filled me with such\nrespect that I dared not ask her point-blank to decide my fate. I made\nup my mind to act as if I entertained no other hope than that she would\nalways let me be her brother and friend.\n\nAn event which long remained inexplicable afforded some distraction\nto my thoughts for a few days. At first I had refused to go and take\npossession of Roche-Mauprat.\n\n\"You really must,\" my uncle had said, \"go and see the improvements I\nhave made in your property, the lands which have been brought under\ncultivation, the cattle that I have put on each of your metayer-farms.\nNow is the time for you to see how your affairs stand, and show your\ntenants that you take an interest in their work. Otherwise, on my death,\neverything will go from bad to worse and you will be obliged to let it,\nwhich may bring you in a larger income, perhaps, but will diminish the\nvalue of the property. I am too old now to go and manage your estate.\nFor the last two years I have been unable to leave off this miserable\ndressing-gown; the abbe does not understand anything about it; Edmee has\nan excellent head; but she cannot bring herself to go to that place; she\nsays she would be too much afraid, which is mere childishness.\"\n\n\"I know that I ought to display more courage,\" I replied; \"and yet,\nuncle, what you are asking me to do is for me the most difficult thing\nin the world. I have not set foot on that accursed soil since the day\nI left it, bearing Edmee away from her captors. It is as if you were\ndriving me out of heaven to send me on a visit to hell.\"\n\nThe chevalier shrugged his shoulders; the abbe implored me to bring\nmyself to do as he wished, as the reluctance I showed was a veritable\ndisappointment to my uncle. I consented, and with a determination to\nconquer myself, I took leave of Edmee for two days. The abbe wanted to\naccompany me, to drive away the gloomy thoughts which would no doubt\nbesiege me; but I had scruples about taking him from Edmee even for this\nshort time; I knew how necessary he was to her. Tied as she was to the\nchevalier's arm-chair, her life was so serious, so retired, that the\nleast change was acutely felt. Each year had increased her isolation,\nand it had become almost complete since the chevalier's failing health\nhad driven from his table those happy children of wine, songs, and\nwitticisms. He had been a great sportsman; and Saint Hubert's Day,\nwhich fell on his birthday, had formerly brought all the nobility of the\nprovince to his house. Year after year the courtyards had resounded with\nthe howls of the pack; year after year the stables had held their two\nlong rows of spirited horses in their glistening stalls; year after year\nthe sound of the horn had echoed through the great woods around, or sent\nout its blast under the windows of the big hall at each toast of the\nbrilliant company. But those glorious days had long disappeared; the\nchevalier had given up hunting; and the hope of obtaining his daughter's\nhand no longer brought round his arm-chair young men, who were bored by\nhis old age, his attacks of gout, and the stories which he would repeat\nin the evening without remembering that he had already told them in the\nmorning. Edmee's obstinate refusals and the dismissal of M. de la Marche\nhad caused great astonishment, and given rise to many conjectures\namong the curious. One young man who was in love with her, and had been\nrejected like the rest, was impelled by a stupid and cowardly conceit to\navenge himself on the only woman of his own class who, according to him,\nhad dared to repulse him. Having discovered that Edmee had been carried\noff by the Hamstringers, he spread a report that she had spent a night\nof wild debauch at Roche-Mauprat. At best, he only deigned to concede\nthat she had yielded only to violence. Edmee commanded too much respect\nand esteem to be accused of having shown complaisance to the brigands;\nbut she soon passed for having been a victim of their brutality. Marked\nwith an indelible stain, she was no longer sought in marriage by any\none. My absence only served to confirm this opinion. I had saved her\nfrom death, it was said, but not from shame, and it was impossible for\nme to make her my wife; I was in love with her, and had fled lest I\nshould yield to the temptation to marry her. All this seemed so probable\nthat it would have been difficult to make the public accept the true\nversion. They were the less ready to accept it from the fact that Edmee\nhad been unwilling to put an end to the evil reports by giving her\nhand to a man she could not love. Such, then, were the causes of her\nisolation; it was not until later that I fully understood them. But I\ncould see the austerity of the chevalier's home and Edmee's melancholy\ncalm, and I was afraid to drop even a dry leaf in the sleeping waters.\nThus I begged the abbe to remain with them until my return. I took no\none with me except my faithful sergeant Marcasse. Edmee had declared\nthat he must not leave me, and had arranged that henceforth he was to\nshare Patience's elegant hut and administrative life.\n\nI arrived at Roche-Mauprat one foggy evening in the early days of\nautumn; the sun was hidden, and all Nature was wrapped in silence and\nmist. The plains were deserted; the air alone seemed alive with the\nnoise of great flocks of birds of passage; cranes were drawing their\ngigantic triangles across the sky, and storks at an immeasurable\nheight were filling the clouds with mournful cries, which fell upon the\nsaddened country like the dirge of parting summer. For the first time in\nthe year I felt a chilliness in the air. I think that all men are filled\nwith an involuntary sadness at the approach of the inclement season.\nIn the first hoar-frosts there is something which bids man remember the\napproaching dissolution of his own being.\n\nMy companion and I had traversed woods and heaths without saying a\nsingle word; we had made a long _detour_ to avoid Gazeau Tower, which I\nfelt I could not bear to look upon again. The sun was sinking in shrouds\nof gray when we passed the portcullis at Roche-Mauprat. This portcullis\nwas broken; the drawbridge was never raised, and the only things that\ncrossed it now were peaceful flocks and their careless shepherds. The\nfosses were half-filled, and the bluish osiers were already spreading\nout their flexible branches over the shallow waters; nettles were\ngrowing at the foot of the crumbling towers, and the traces of the\nfire seemed still fresh upon the walls. The farm buildings had all been\nrepaired; and the court, full of cattle and poultry and sheep-dogs and\nagricultural implements, contrasted strangely with the gloomy inclosure\nin which I still seemed to see the red flames of the besiegers shooting\nup, and the black blood of the Mauprats flowing.\n\nI was received with the quiet and somewhat chilly hospitality of the\npeasants of Berry. They did not lay themselves out to please me, but\nthey let me want for nothing. Quarters were found for me in the only\none of the old wings which had not been damaged in the siege, or\nsubsequently abandoned to the ravages of time. The massive architecture\nof the body of the building dated from the tenth century; the door was\nsmaller than the windows, and the windows themselves gave so little\nlight that we had to take candles to find our way, although the sun had\nhardly set. The building had been restored provisionally to serve as an\noccasional lodging for the new seigneur or his stewards. My Uncle Hubert\nhad often been there to see to my interests so long as his strength had\nallowed him; and they showed me to the room which he had reserved for\nhimself, and which had therefore been known as the master's room. The\nbest things that had been saved from the old furniture had been placed\nthere; and, as it was cold and damp, in spite of all the trouble they\nhad taken to make it habitable, the tenant's servant preceded me with a\nfirebrand in one hand and a fagot in the other.\n\nBlinded by the smoke which she scattered round me in clouds, and\ndeceived by the new entrance which they had made in another part of the\ncourtyard, and by certain corridors which they had walled up to save the\ntrouble of looking after them, I reached the room without recognising\nanything; indeed, I could not have said in what part of the old\nbuildings I was, to such an extent had the new appearance of the\ncourtyard upset my recollections, and so little had my mind in its gloom\nand agitation been impressed by surrounding objects.\n\nWhile the servant was lighting the fire, I threw myself into a chair,\nand, burying my head in my hands, fell into a melancholy train of\nthought. My position, however, was not without a certain charm; for the\npast naturally appears in an embellished or softened form to the minds\nof young men, those presumptuous masters of the future. When, by dint of\nblowing the brand, the servant had filled the room with dense smoke, she\nwent off to fetch some embers and left me alone. Marcasse had remained\nin the stable to attend to our horses. Blaireau had followed me;\nlying down by the hearth, he glanced at me from time to time with a\ndissatisfied air, as if to ask me the reason of such wretched lodging\nand such a poor fire.\n\nSuddenly, as I cast my eyes round the room, old memories seemed to\nawaken in me. The fire, after making the green wood hiss, sent a flame\nup the chimney, and the whole room was illumined with a bright\nthough unsteady light, which gave all the objects a weird, ambiguous\nappearance. Blaireau rose, turned his back to the fire and sat down\nbetween my legs, as if he thought that something strange and unexpected\nwas going to happen.\n\nI then realized that this place was none other than my grandfather\nTristan's bed-room, afterward occupied for several years by his eldest\nson, the detestable John, my cruelest oppressor, the most crafty and\ncowardly of the Hamstringers. I was filled with a sense of terror and\ndisgust on recognising the furniture, even the very bed with twisted\nposts on which my grandfather had given up his blackened soul to God,\namid all the torments of a lingering death agony. The arm-chair which I\nwas sitting in was the one in which John the Crooked (as he was pleased\nto call himself in his facetious days) used to sit and think out his\nvillainies or issue his odious orders. At this moment I thought I saw\nthe ghosts of all the Mauprats passing before me, with their bloody\nhands and their eyes dulled with wine. I got up and was about to yield\nto the horror I felt by taking to flight, when suddenly I saw a figure\nrise up in front of me, so distinct, so recognisable, so different in\nits vivid reality from the chimeras that had just besieged me, that I\nfell back in my chair, all bathed in a cold sweat. Standing by the\nbed was John Mauprat. He had just got out, for he was holding the\nhalf-opened curtain in his hand. He seemed to me the same as formerly,\nonly he was still thinner, and paler and more hideous. His head was\nshaved, and his body wrapped in a dark winding-sheet. He gave me a\nhellish glance; a smile full of hate and contempt played on his thin,\nshrivelled lips. He stood motionless with his gleaming eyes fixed on me,\nand seemed as if about to speak. In that instant I was convinced that\nwhat I was looking on was a living being, a man of flesh and blood; it\nseems incredible, therefore, that I should have felt paralyzed by such\nchildish fear. But it would be idle for me to deny it, nor have I ever\nyet been able to find an explanation; I was riveted to the ground with\nfear. The man's glance petrified me; I could not utter a sound. Blaireau\nrushed at him; then he waved the folds of his funeral garment, like a\nshroud all foul with the dampness of the tomb, and I fainted.\n\nWhen I recovered consciousness Marcasse was by my side, anxiously\nendeavouring to lift me. I was lying on the ground rigid as a corpse. It\nwas with a great difficulty that I collected my thoughts; but, as soon\nas I could stand upright, I seized Marcasse and hurriedly dragged him\nout of the accursed room. I had several narrow escapes of falling as\nI hastened down the winding stairs, and it was only on breathing the\nevening air in the courtyard, and smelling the healthy odour of the\nstables, that I recovered the use of my reason.\n\nI did not hesitate to look upon what had just happened as an\nhallucination. I had given proof of my courage in war in the presence of\nmy worthy sergeant; I did not blush, therefore, to confess the truth\nto him. I answered his questions frankly, and I described my horrible\nvision with such minute details that he, too, was impressed with the\nreality of it, and, as he walked about with me in the courtyard, kept\nrepeating with a thoughtful air:\n\n\"Singular, singular! Astonishing!\"\n\n\"No, it is not astonishing,\" I said, when I felt that I had quite\nrecovered. \"I experienced a most painful sensation on my way here;\nfor several days I had struggled to overcome my aversion to seeing\nRoche-Mauprat again. Last night I had a nightmare, and I felt so\nexhausted and depressed this morning that, if I had not been afraid of\noffending my uncle, I should have postponed this disagreeable visit. As\nwe entered the place, I felt a chill come over me; there seemed to be a\nweight on my chest, and I could not breathe. Probably, too, the pungent\nsmoke that filled the room disturbed my brain. Again, after all the\nhardships and dangers of our terrible voyage, from which we have hardly\nrecovered, either of us, is it astonishing that my nerves gave way at\nthe first painful emotion?\"\n\n\"Tell me,\" replied Marcasse, who was still pondering the matter, \"did\nyou notice Blaireau at the moment? What did Blaireau do?\"\n\n\"I thought I saw Blaireau rush at the phantom at the moment when it\ndisappeared; but I suppose I dreamt that like the rest.\"\n\n\"Hum!\" said the sergeant. \"When I entered, Blaireau was wildly excited.\nHe kept coming to you, sniffing, whining in his way, running to the\nbed, scratching the wall, coming to me, running to you. Strange, that!\nAstonishing, captain, astonishing, that!\"\n\nAfter a silence of a few moments:\n\n\"Devil don't return!\" he exclaimed, shaking his head. \"Dead never\nreturn; besides, why dead, John? Not dead! Still two Mauprats! Who\nknows? Where the devil? Dead don't return; and my master--mad? Never.\nIll? No.\"\n\nAfter this colloquy the sergeant went and fetched a light, drew his\nfaithful sword from the scabbard, whistled Blaireau, and bravely seized\nthe rope which served as a balustrade for the staircase, requesting me\nto remain below. Great as was my repugnance to entering the room again,\nI did not hesitate to follow Marcasse, in spite of his recommendation.\nOur first care was to examine the bed; but while we had been talking in\nthe courtyard the servant had brought clean sheets, had made the bed,\nand was now smoothing the blankets.\n\n\"Who has been sleeping there?\" asked Marcasse, with his usual caution.\n\n\"Nobody,\" she replied, \"except M. le Chevalier or M. l'Abbe Aubert, in\nthe days when they used to come.\"\n\n\"But yesterday, or to-day, I mean?\" said Marcasse.\n\n\"Oh! yesterday and to-day, nobody, sir; for it is quite two years since\nM. le Chevalier came here; and as for M. l'Abbe, he never sleeps here,\nnow that he comes alone. He arrives in the morning, has lunch with us,\nand goes back in the evening.\"\n\n\"But the bed was disarranged,\" said Marcasse, looking at her\nattentively.\n\n\"Oh, well! that may be, sir,\" she replied. \"I do not know how they left\nit the last time some one slept here; I did not pay any attention to\nthat as I put on the sheets; all I know is that M. Bernard's cloak was\nlying on the top.\"\n\n\"My cloak?\" I exclaimed. \"It was left in the stable.\"\n\n\"And mine, too,\" said Marcasse. \"I have just folded both together and\nput them on the corn-bin.\"\n\n\"You must have had two, then,\" replied the servant; \"for I am sure I\ntook one off the bed. It was a black cloak, not new.\"\n\nMine, as a fact, was lined with red and trimmed with gold lace.\nMarcasse's was light gray. It could not, therefore, have been one of\nour cloaks brought up for a moment by the man and then taken back to the\nstable.\n\n\"But, what did you do with it?\" said the sergeant.\n\n\"My word, sir,\" replied the fat girl, \"I put it there, over the\narm-chair. You must have taken it while I went to get a candle. I can't\nsee it now.\"\n\nWe searched the room thoroughly; the cloak was not to be found. We\npretended that we needed it, not denying that it was ours. The servant\nunmade the bed in our presence, and then went and asked the man what\nhe had done with it. Nothing could be found either in the bed or in the\nroom; the man had not been upstairs. All the farm-folk were in a state\nof excitement, fearing that some one might be accused of theft. We\ninquired if a stranger had not come to Roche-Mauprat, and if he was\nnot still there. When we ascertained that these good people had neither\nhoused or seen any one, we reassured them about the lost cloak by saying\nthat Marcasse had accidentally folded it with the two others. Then we\nshut ourselves in the room, in order to explore it at our ease; for it\nwas now almost evident that what I had seen was by no means a ghost, but\nJohn Mauprat himself, or a man very like him, whom I had mistaken for\nJohn.\n\nMarcasse having aroused Blaireau by voice and gesture, watched all his\nmovements.\n\n\"Set your mind at rest,\" he said with pride; \"the old dog has not\nforgotten his old trade. If there is a hole, a hole as big as your hand,\nhave no fear. Now, old dog! Have no fear.\"\n\nBlaireau, indeed, after sniffing everywhere, persisted in scratching the\nwall where I had seen the apparition; he would start back every time his\npointed nose came to a certain spot in the wainscotting; then, wagging\nhis bushy tail with a satisfied air, he would return to his master as if\nto tell him to concentrate his attention on this spot. The sergeant then\nbegan to examine the wall and the woodwork; he tried to insinuate his\nsword into some crack; there was no sign of an opening. Still, a door\nmight have been there, for the flowers carved on the woodwork would hide\na skilfully constructed sliding panel. The essential thing was to find\nthe spring that made this panel work; but that was impossible in spite\nof all the efforts we made for two long hours. In vain did we try to\nshake the panel; it gave forth the same sound as the others. They were\nall sonorous, showing that the wainscot was not in immediate contact\nwith the masonry. Still, there might be a gap of only a few inches\nbetween them. At last Marcasse, perspiring profusely, stopped, and said\nto me:\n\n\"This is very stupid; if we searched all night we should not find a\nspring if there is none; and however hard we hammered, we could not\nbreak in the door if there happened to be big iron bars behind it, as I\nhave sometimes seen in other old country-houses.\"\n\n\"The axe might help us to find a passage,\" I said, \"if there is one; but\nwhy, simply because your dog scratches the wall, persist in believing\nthat John Mauprat, or the man who resembles him, could not have come in\nand gone out by the door?\"\n\n\"Come in, if you like,\" replied Marcasse, \"but gone out--no, on my\nhonour! For, as the servant came down I was on the staircase brushing my\nboots. As soon as I heard something fall here, I rushed up quickly three\nstairs at a time, and found that it was you--like a corpse, stretched\nout on the floor, very ill; no one inside nor outside, on my honour!\n\n\"In that case, then, I must have dreamt of my fiend of an uncle, and the\nservant must have dreamt of the black cloak; for it is pretty certain\nthat there is no secret door here; and even if there were one, and all\nthe Mauprats, living and dead, knew the secret of it, what were that to\nus? Do we belong to the police that we should hunt out these wretched\ncreatures? And if by chance we found them hidden somewhere, should we\nnot help them to escape, rather than hand them over to justice? We are\narmed; we need not be afraid that they will assassinate us to-night; and\nif they amuse themselves by frightening us, my word, woe betide them!\nI have no eye for either relatives or friends when I am startled in my\nsleep. So come, let us attack the omelette that these good people my\ntenants are preparing for us; for if we continue knocking and scratching\nthe walls they will think we are mad.\"\n\nMarcasse yielded from a sense of duty rather than from conviction. He\nseemed to attach great importance to the discovery of this mystery, and\nto be far from easy in his mind. He was unwilling to let me remain alone\nin the haunted room, and pretended that I might fall ill again and have\na fit.\n\n\"Oh, this time,\" I said, \"I shall not play the coward. The cloak has\ncured me of my fear of ghosts; and I should not advise any one to meddle\nwith me.\"\n\nThe hildago was obliged to leave me alone. I loaded my pistols and put\nthem on the table within reach of my hand; but these precautions were a\npure waste of time; nothing disturbed the silence of the room, and\nthe heavy red silk curtains, with their coat of arms at the corners in\ntarnished silver, were not stirred by the slightest breath. Marcasse\nreturned and, delighted at finding me as cheerful as he had left me,\nbegan preparing our supper with as much care as if we had come to\nRoche-Mauprat for the sole purpose of making a good meal. He made jokes\nabout the capon which was still singing on the spit, and about the wine\nwhich was so like a brush in the throat. His good humour increased when\nthe tenant appeared, bringing a few bottles of excellent Madeira, which\nhad been left with him by the chevalier, who liked to drink a glass or\ntwo before setting foot in the stirrup. In return we invited the worthy\nman to sup with us, as the least tedious way of discussing business\nmatters.\n\n\"Good,\" he said; \"it will be like old times when the peasants used to\neat at the table of the seigneurs of Roche-Mauprat. You are doing the\nsame, Monsieur Bernard, you are quite right.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" I replied very coldly; \"only I behave thus with those who\nowe me money, not those to whom I owe it.\"\n\nThis reply, and the word \"sir,\" frightened him so much that he was at\ngreat pains to excuse himself from sitting down to table. However, I\ninsisted, as I wished to give him the measure of my character at once. I\ntreated him as a man I was raising to my own level, not as one to whom I\nwished to descend. I forced him to be cleanly in his jokes, but allowed\nhim to be free and facetious within the limits of decent mirth. He was\na frank, jovial man. I questioned him minutely to discover if he was\nnot in league with the phantom who was in the habit of leaving his cloak\nupon the bed. This, however, seemed far from probable; the man evidently\nhad such an aversion for the Hamstringers, that, had not a regard for\nmy relationship held him back, he would have been only too glad to have\ngiven them such a dressing in my presence as they deserved. But I could\nnot allow him any license on this point; so I requested him to give me\nan account of my property, which he did with intelligence, accuracy, and\nhonesty.\n\nAs he withdrew I noticed that the Madeira had had considerable effect on\nhim; he seemed to have no control over his legs, which kept catching\nin the furniture; and yet he had been in sufficient possession of his\nfaculties to reason correctly. I have always observed that wine acts\nmuch more powerfully on the muscles of peasants than on their nerves;\nthat they rarely lose their heads, and that, on the contrary, stimulants\nproduce in them a bliss unknown to us; the pleasure they derive from\ndrunkenness is quite different from ours and very superior to our\nfebrile exaltation.\n\nWhen Marcasse and I found ourselves alone, though we were not drunk, we\nrealized that the wine had filled us with gaiety and light-heartedness\nwhich we should not have felt at Roche-Mauprat, even without the\nadventure of the ghost. Accustomed as we were to speak our thoughts\nfreely, we confessed mutually, and agreed that we were much better\nprepared than before supper to receive all the bogies of Varenne.\n\nThis word \"bogey\" reminded me of the adventure which had brought me into\nfar from friendly contact with Patience at the age of thirteen. Marcasse\nknew about it already, but he knew very little of my character at that\ntime, and I amused myself by telling him of my wild rush across the\nfields after being thrashed by the sorcerer.\n\n\"This makes me think,\" I concluded by saying, \"that I have an\nimagination which easily gets overexcited, and that I am not above fear\nof the supernatural. Thus the apparition just now . . .\"\n\n\"No matter, no matter,\" said Marcasse, looking at the priming of my\npistols, and putting them on the table by my bed. \"Do not forget that\nall the Hamstringers are not dead; that, if John is in this world, he\nwill do harm until he is under the ground, and trebly locked in hell.\"\n\nThe wine was loosening the hidalgo's tongue; on those rare occasions\nwhen he allowed himself to depart from his usual sobriety, he was not\nwanting in wit. He was unwilling to leave me, and made a bed for himself\nby the side of mine. My nerves were excited by the incidents of the day,\nand I allowed myself, therefore, to speak of Edmee, not in such a way as\nto deserve the shadow of a reproach from her if she had heard my words,\nbut more freely than I might have spoken with a man who was as yet my\ninferior and not my friend, as he became later. I could not say exactly\nhow much I confessed to him of my sorrows and hopes and anxieties; but\nthose confidences had a disastrous effect, as you will soon see.\n\nWe fell asleep while we were talking, with Blaireau at his master's\nfeet, the hidalgo's sword across his knees near the dog, the light\nbetween us, my pistols ready to hand, my hunting-knife under my pillow,\nand the bolts shot. Nothing disturbed our repose. When the sun awakened\nus the cocks were crowing merrily in the courtyard, and the labourers\nwere cracking their rustic jokes as they yoked the oxen under our\nwindows.\n\n\"All the same there is something at the bottom of it.\"\n\nSuch was Marcasse's first remark as he opened his eyes, and took up the\nconversation where he had dropped it the night before.\n\n\"Did you see or hear anything during the night?\" I asked.\n\n\"Nothing at all,\" he replied. \"All the same, Blaireau has been disturbed\nin his sleep; for my sword has fallen down; and then, we found no\nexplanation of what happened here.\"\n\n\"Let who will explain it,\" I answered. \"I shall certainly not trouble\nmyself.\"\n\n\"Wrong, wrong; you are wrong!\"\n\n\"That may be, my good sergeant; but I do not like this room at all, and\nit seems to me so ugly by daylight, that I feel that I must get far away\nfrom it, and breathe some pure air.\"\n\n\"Well, I will go with you; but I shall return. I do not want to leave\nthis to chance. I know what John Mauprat is capable of; you don't.\"\n\n\"I do not wish to know; and if there is any danger here for myself or my\nfriends, I do not wish you to return.\"\n\nMarcasse shook his head and said nothing. We went round the farm once\nmore before departing. Marcasse was very much struck with a certain\nincident to which I should have paid but little attention. The farmer\nwished to introduce me to his wife, but she could not be persuaded to\nsee me, and went and hid herself in the hemp-field. I attributed this to\nthe shyness of youth.\n\n\"Fine youth, my word!\" said Marcasse; \"youth like mine fifty years old\nand more! There is something beneath it, something beneath, I tell you.\"\n\n\"What the devil can there be?\"\n\n\"Hum! She was very friendly with John Mauprat in her day. She found\nhis crooked legs to her liking. I know about it; yes, I know many other\nthings, too; many things--you may take my word!\"\n\n\"You shall tell me them the next time we come; and that will not be so\nsoon; for my affairs are going on much better than if I interfered with\nthem; and I should not like to get into the habit of drinking Madeira\nto prevent myself from being frightened at my own shadow. And now,\nMarcasse, I must ask you as a favour not to tell any one what has\nhappened. Everybody has not your respect for your captain.\"\n\n\"The man who does not respect my captain is an idiot,\" answered the\nhidalgo, in a tone of authority; \"but, if you order me, I will say\nnothing.\"\n\nHe kept his word. I would not on any account have had Edmee's mind\ndisturbed by this stupid tale. However, I could not prevent Marcasse\nfrom carrying out his design; early the following morning he\ndisappeared, and I learnt from Patience that he had returned to\nRoche-Mauprat under the pretence of having forgotten something.\n\n\n\n\nXVIII\n\nWhile Marcasse was devoting himself to serious investigations, I was\nspending days of delight and agony in Edmee's presence. Her behaviour,\nso constant and devoted, and yet in many respects so reserved, threw me\ninto continual alternations of joy and grief. One day while I was taking\na walk the chevalier had a long conversation with her. I happened to\nreturn when their discussion had reached its most animated stage. As\nsoon as I appeared, my uncle said to me:\n\n\"Here, Bernard; come and tell Edmee that you love her; that you will\nmake her happy; that you have got rid of your old faults. Do something\nto get yourself accepted; for things cannot go on as they are. Our\nposition with our neighbours is unbearable; and before I go down to the\ngrave I should like to see my daughter's honour cleared from stain, and\nto feel sure that some stupid caprice of hers will not cast her into a\nconvent, when she ought to be filling that position in society to which\nshe is entitled, and which I have worked all my life to win for her.\nCome, Bernard, at her feet, lad! Have the wit to say something that will\npersuade her! Otherwise I shall think--God forgive me!--that it is you\nthat do not love her and do not honestly wish to marry her.\"\n\n\"I! Great heavens!\" I exclaimed. \"Not wish to marry her--when for seven\nyears I have had no other thought; when that is the one wish of my\nheart, and the only happiness my mind can conceive!\"\n\nThen I poured forth all the thoughts that the sincerest passion could\nsuggest. She listened to me in silence, and without withdrawing her\nhands, which I covered with kisses. But there was a serious expression\nin her eyes, and the tone of her voice made me tremble when, after\nreflecting a few moments, she said:\n\n\"Father, you should not doubt my word; I have promised to marry Bernard;\nI promised him, and I promised you; it is certain, therefore, that I\nshall marry him.\"\n\nThen she added, after a fresh pause, and in a still severe tone:\n\n\"But if, father, you believe that you are on the brink of the grave,\nwhat sort of heart do you suppose I can have, that you bid me think only\nof myself, and put on my wedding-dress in the hour of mourning for you?\nIf, on the contrary, you are, as I believe, still full of vigour, in\nspite of your sufferings, and destined to enjoy the love of your family\nfor many a long year yet, why do you urge me so imperiously to cut\nshort the time I have requested? Is not the question important enough\nto demand my most serious reflection? A contract which is to bind me for\nthe rest of my life, and on which depends, I do not say my happiness,\nfor that I would gladly sacrifice to your least wish, but the peace\nof my conscience and the dignity of my conduct (since no woman can\nbe sufficiently sure of herself to answer for a future which has been\nfettered against her will), does not such a contract bid me weigh all\nits risks and all its advantages for several years at least?\"\n\n\"Good God!\" said the chevalier. \"Have you not been weighing all this for\nthe last seven years? You ought to have arrived at some conclusion about\nyour cousin by now. If you are willing to marry him, marry him; but if\nnot, for God's sake say so, and let another man come forward.\"\n\n\"Father,\" replied Edmee, somewhat coldly, \"I shall marry none but him.\"\n\n\"'None but him' is all very well,\" said the chevalier, tapping the logs\nwith the tongs; \"but that does not necessarily mean that you will marry\nhim.\"\n\n\"Yes, I will marry him, father,\" answered Edmee. \"I could have wished\nto be free a few months more; but since you are displeased at all these\ndelays, I am ready to obey your orders, as you know.\"\n\n\"Parbleu! that is a pretty way of consenting,\" exclaimed my uncle, \"and\nno doubt most gratifying to your cousin! By Jove! Bernard, I have lived\nmany years in this world, but I must own that I can't understand these\nwomen yet, and it is very probable that I shall die without ever having\nunderstood them.\"\n\n\"Uncle,\" I said, \"I can quite understand my cousin's aversion for me; it\nis only what I deserve. I have done all I could to atone for my errors.\nBut, is it altogether in her power to forget a past which has doubtless\ncaused her too much pain? However, if she does not forgive me, I will\nimitate her severity: I will not forgive myself. Abandoning all hope in\nthis world, I will tear myself away from her and you, and chasten myself\nwith a punishment worse than death.\"\n\n\"That's it! Go on! There's an end of everything!\" said the chevalier,\nthrowing the tongs into the fire. \"That is just what you have been\naiming at, I suppose, Edmee?\"\n\nI had moved a few steps towards the door; I was suffering intensely.\nEdmee ran after me, took me by the arm, and brought me back towards her\nfather.\n\n\"It is cruel and most ungrateful of you to say that,\" she said. \"Does\nit show a modest spirit and generous heart, to forget a friendship, a\ndevotion, I may even venture to say, a fidelity of seven years, because\nI ask to prove you for a few months more? And even if my affection for\nyou should never be as deep as yours for me, is what I have hitherto\nshown you of so little account that you despise it and reject it,\nbecause you are vexed at not inspiring me with precisely as much as you\nthink you are entitled to? You know at this rate a woman would have no\nright to feel affection. However, tell me, is it your wish to punish\nme for having been a mother to you by leaving me altogether, or to make\nsome return only on condition that I become your slave?\"\n\n\"No, Edmee, no,\" I replied, with my heart breaking and my eyes full of\ntears, as I raised her hand to my lips; \"I feel that you have done far\nmore for me than I deserved; I feel that it would be idle to think of\ntearing myself from your presence; but can you account it a crime in me\nto suffer by your side? In any case it is so involuntary, so inevitable\na crime, that it must needs escape all your reproaches and all my own\nremorse. But let us talk of this no more. It is all I can do. Grant me\nyour friendship still; I shall hope to show myself always worthy of you\nin the future.\"\n\n\"Come, kiss each other,\" said the chevalier, much affected, \"and never\nseparate. Bernard, however capricious Edmee may seem, never abandon\nher, if you would deserve the blessing of your foster-father. Though you\nshould never be her husband, always be a brother to her. Remember, my\nlad, that she will soon be alone in the world, and that I shall die\nin sorrow if I do not carry with me to the grave a conviction that a\nsupport and a defender still remains to her. Remember, too, that it is\non your account, on account of a vow, which her inclination, perhaps,\nwould reject, but which her conscience respects, that she is thus\nforsaken and slandered . . .\"\n\nThe chevalier burst into tears, and in a moment all the sorrows of the\nunfortunate family were revealed to me.\n\n\"Enough, enough!\" I cried, falling at their feet. \"All this is too\ncruel. I should be the meanest wretch on earth if I had need to be\nreminded of my misdeeds and my duties. Let me weep at your knees; let\nme atone for the wrong I have done you by eternal grief, by eternal\nrenunciation. Why not have driven me away when I did the wrong? Why not,\nuncle, have blown out my brains with your pistol, as if I had been a\nwild beast? What have I done to be spared, I who repaid your kindness\nwith the ruin of your honour? No, no; I can see that Edmee ought not to\nmarry me; that would be accepting the shame of the insult I have drawn\nupon her. All I ask is to be allowed to remain here; I will never see\nher face, if she makes this a condition; but I will lie at her door like\na faithful dog and tear to pieces the first man who dares to present\nhimself otherwise than on his knees; and if some day an honest man,\nmore fortunate than myself, shows himself worthy of her love, far\nfrom opposing him, I will intrust to him the dear and sacred task of\nprotecting and vindicating her. I will be but a friend, a brother to\nher, and when I see that they are happy together, I will go far away\nfrom them and die in peace.\"\n\nMy sobs choked me; the chevalier pressed his daughter and myself to his\nheart, and we mingled our tears, swearing to him that we would never\nleave each other, either during his life or after his death.\n\n\"Still, do not give up all hope of marrying her,\" whispered the\nchevalier to me a few moments later, when we were somewhat calmer. \"She\nhas strange whims; but nothing will persuade me to believe that she does\nnot love you. She does not want to explain matters yet. Woman's will is\nGod's will.\"\n\n\"And Edmee's will is my will,\" I replied.\n\nA few days after this scene, which brought the calmness of death into\nmy soul in place of the tumult of life, I was strolling in the park with\nthe abbe.\n\n\"I must tell you,\" he said, \"of an adventure which befell me yesterday.\nThere is a touch of romance in it. I had been for a walk in the woods of\nBriantes, and had made my way down to the spring of Fougeres. It was\nas warm, you remember, as in the middle of summer; and our beautiful\nplants, in their autumn red, seemed more beautiful than ever as they\nstretched their delicate tracery over the stream. The trees have very\nlittle foliage left; but the carpet of dried leaves one walks upon gives\nforth a sound which to me is full of charm. The satiny trunks of the\nbirches and young oaks are covered with moss and creepers of all shades\nof brown, and tender green, and red and fawn, which spread out into\ndelicate stars and rosettes, and maps of all countries, wherein the\nimagination can behold new worlds in miniature. I kept gazing lovingly\non these marvels of grace and delicacy, these arabesques in which\ninfinite variety is combined with unfailing regularity, and as I\nremembered with pleasure that you are not, like the vulgar, blind to\nthese adorable coquetries of nature, I gathered a few with the greatest\ncare, even bringing away the bark of the tree on which they had taken\nroot, in order not to destroy the perfection of their designs. I made\na little collection, which I left at Patience's as I passed; we will\ngo and see them, if you like. But, on our way, I must tell you what\nhappened to me as I approached the spring. I was walking upon the wet\nstones with my head down, guided by the slight noise of the clear little\njet of water which bursts from the heart of the mossy rock. I was about\nto sit down on the stone which forms a natural seat at the side of it,\nwhen I saw that the place was already occupied by a good friar whose\npale, haggard face was half-hidden by his cowl of coarse cloth. He\nseemed much frightened at my arrival; I did my best to reassure him by\ndeclaring that my intention was not to disturb him, but merely to put my\nlips to the little bark channel which the woodcutters have fixed to the\nrock to enable one to drink more easily.\n\n\"'Oh, holy priest,' he said to me in the humblest tone, 'why are you\nnot the prophet whose rod could smite the founts of grace? and why\ncannot my soul, like this rock, give forth a stream of tears?'\n\n\"Struck by the manner in which this monk expressed himself, by his sad\nair, by his thoughtful attitude in this poetic spot, which has often\nmade me dream of the meeting of the Saviour and the woman of Samaria, I\nallowed myself to be drawn into a more intimate conversation. I\nlearnt from the monk that he was a Trappist, and that he was making a\npenitential tour.\n\n\"'Ask neither my name nor whence I come,' he said. 'I belong to an\nillustrious family who would blush to know that I am still alive.\nBesides, on entering the Trappist order, we abjure all pride in the\npast; we make ourselves like new-born children; we become dead to the\nworld that we may live again in Jesus Christ. But of this be sure: you\nbehold in me one of the most striking examples of the miraculous power\nof grace; and if I could make known to you the tale of my religious\nlife, of my terrors, my remorse, and my expiations, you would certainly\nbe touched by it. But of what avail the indulgence and compassion of\nman, if the pity of God will not deign to absolve me?'\n\n\"You know,\" continued the abbe, \"that I do not like monks, that I\ndistrust their humility and abhor their lives of inaction. But this man\nspoke in so sad and kindly a manner; he was so filled with a sense\nof his duty; he seemed so ill, so emaciated by asceticism, so truly\npenitent, that he won my heart. In his looks and in his talk were bright\nflashes which betrayed a powerful intellect, indefatigable energy, and\nindomitable perseverance. We spent two whole hours together, and I was\nso moved by what he said that on leaving him I expressed a wish to see\nhim again before he left this neighbourhood. He had found a lodging for\nthe night at the Goulets farm, and I tried in vain to persuade him to\naccompany me to the chateau. He told me that he had a companion he could\nnot leave.\n\n\"'But, since you are so sympathetic,' he said, 'I shall esteem it a\npleasure to meet you here to-morrow towards sunset; perhaps I may\neven venture to ask a favour of you; you can be of service to me in an\nimportant matter which I have to arrange in this neighbourhood; more\nthan this I cannot tell you at the present moment.'\n\n\"I assured him that he could reckon on me, and that I should only be too\nhappy to oblige a man such as himself.\"\n\n\"And the result is, I suppose, that you are waiting impatiently for the\nhour of your appointment?\" I said to the abbe.\n\n\"I am,\" he replied; \"and my new acquaintance has so many attractions for\nme that, if I were not afraid of abusing the confidence he has placed in\nme, I should take Edmee to the spring of Fougeres.\"\n\n\"I fancy,\" I replied, \"that Edmee has something better to do than to\nlisten to the declamations of your monk, who perhaps, after all, is only\na knave, like so many others to whom you have given money blindly. You\nwill forgive me, I know, abbe; but you are not a good physiognomist, and\nyou are rather apt to form a good or bad opinion of people for no reason\nexcept that your own romantic nature happens to feel kindly or timidly\ndisposed towards them.\"\n\nThe abbe smiled and pretended that I said this because I bore him a\ngrudge; he again asserted his belief in the Trappist's piety, and then\nwent back to botany. We passed some time at Patience's, examining the\ncollection of plants; and as my one desire was to escape from my own\nthoughts, I left the hut with the abbe and accompanied him as far as the\nwood where he was to meet the monk. In proportion as we drew near to\nthe place the abbe seemed to lose more and more of his eagerness of the\nprevious evening, and even expressed a fear that he had gone too\nfar. This hesitation, following so quickly upon enthusiasm, was very\ncharacteristic of the abbe's mobile, loving, timid nature, with its\nstrange union of the most contrary impulses, and I again began to rally\nhim with all the freedom of friendship.\n\n\"Come, then,\" he said, \"I should like to be satisfied about this; you\nmust see him. You can study his face for a few minutes, and then leave\nus together, since I have promised to listen to his secrets.\"\n\nAs I had nothing better to do I followed the abbe; but as soon as we\nreached a spot overlooking the shady rocks whence the water issues,\nI stopped and examined the monk through the branches of a clump of\nash-trees. Seated immediately beneath us by the side of the spring, he\nhad his eyes turned inquiringly on the angle of the path by which he\nexpected the abbe to arrive; but he did not think of looking at the\nplace where we were, and we could examine him at our ease without being\nseen by him.\n\nNo sooner had I caught sight of him than, with a bitter laugh, I took\nthe abbe by the arm, drew him back a short distance, and, not without\nconsiderable agitation, said to him:\n\n\"My dear abbe, in bygone years did you never catch sight of the face of\nmy uncle, John de Mauprat?\"\n\n\"Never, as far as I know,\" replied the abbe, quite amazed. \"But what are\nyou driving at?\"\n\n\"Only this, my friend; you have made a pretty find here; this good\nand venerable Trappist, in whom you see so much grace and candour, and\ncontrition, and intelligence, is none other than John de Mauprat, the\nHamstringer.\"\n\n\"You must be mad!\" cried the abbe, starting back. \"John de Mauprat died\na long time ago.\"\n\n\"John Mauprat is not dead, nor perhaps Antony Mauprat either; and my\nsurprise is less than yours only because I have already met one of these\ntwo ghosts. That he has become a monk, and is repenting for his sins,\nis very possible; but alas! it is by no means impossible that he has\ndisguised himself in order to carry out some evil design, and I advise\nyou to be on your guard.\"\n\nThe abbe was so frightened that he no longer wanted to keep his\nappointment. I suggested that it would be well to learn what the old\nsinner was aiming at. But, as I knew the abbe's weak character, and\nfeared that my Uncle John would manage to win his heart by his lying\nconfessions and wheedle him into some false step, I made up my mind to\nhide in a thicket whence I could see and hear everything.\n\nBut things did not happen as I had expected. The Trappist, instead of\nplaying the politician, immediately made known his real name to the\nabbe. He declared that he was full of contrition, and that, as his\nconscience would not allow him to make the monk's habit a refuge from\npunishment (he had really been a Trappist for several years), he was\nabout to put himself into the hands of justice, that he might atone in\na striking way for the crimes with which he was polluted. This man,\nendowed as he was with conspicuous abilities, had acquired a\nmystic eloquence in the cloister. He spoke with so much grace and\npersuasiveness that I was fascinated no less than the abbe. It was in\nvain that the latter attempted to combat a resolution which appeared\nto him insane; John Mauprat showed the most unflinching devotion to his\nreligious ideas. He declared that, having committed the crimes of the\nold barbarous paganism, he could not ransom his soul save by a public\nexpiation worthy of the early Christians.\n\n\"It is possible,\" he said, \"to be a coward with God as well as with man,\nand in the silence of my vigils I hear a terrible voice answering to my\ntears: 'Miserable craven, it is the fear of man that has thrown you upon\nthe bosom of God, and if you had not feared temporal death, you would\nnever have thought of life eternal!'\n\n\"Then I realize that what I most dread is not God's wrath, but the rope\nand the hangman that await me among my fellows. Well, it is time to end\nthis sense of secret shame; not until the day when men crush me beneath\ntheir abuse and punishment shall I fell absolved and restored in the\nsight of Heaven; then only shall I account myself worthy to say to Jesus\nmy Saviour: 'Give ear to me, innocent victim, Thou who heardest the\npenitent thief; give ear to a sullied but contrite victim, who has\nshared in the glory of Thy martyrdom and been ransomed by Thy blood!'\"\n\n\"If you persist in your enthusiastic design,\" said the abbe, after\nunsuccessfully bringing forward all possible objections, \"you must at\nleast let me know in what way you thought I could be of service to you.\"\n\n\"I cannot act in this matter,\" replied the Trappist, \"without the\nconsent of a young man who will soon be the last of the Mauprats; for\nthe chevalier has not many days to wait before he will receive the\nheavenly reward due to his virtues; and as for myself, I cannot avoid\nthe punishment I am about to seek, except by falling back into the\nendless night of the cloister. I speak of Bernard Mauprat; I will not\ncall him my nephew, for if he heard me he would blush to think that he\nbore this shameful title. I heard of his return from America, and this\nnews decided me to undertake the journey at the painful end of which you\nnow behold me.\"\n\nIt seemed to me that while he was saying this he kept casting\nside-glances towards the clump of trees where I was, as if he had\nguessed my presence there. Perhaps the movement of some branches had\nbetrayed me.\n\n\"May I ask,\" said the abbe, \"what you now have in common with this young\nman? Are you not afraid that, embittered by the harsh treatment formerly\nlavished on him at Roche-Mauprat, he may refuse to see you?\"\n\n\"I am certain that he will refuse; for I know the hatred that he still\nhas for me,\" said the Trappist, once more looking towards the spot where\nI was. \"But I hope that you will persuade him to grant me an interview;\nfor you are a good and generous man, Monsieur l'Abbe. You promised to\noblige me; and, besides, you are young Mauprat's friend, and you will\nbe able to make him understand that his interests are at stake and the\nhonour of his name.\"\n\n\"How so?\" answered the abbe. \"No doubt he will be far from pleased to\nsee you appear before the courts to answer for crimes which have since\nbeen effaced in the gloom of the cloister. He will certainly wish you to\nforego this public expiation. How can you hope that he will consent?\"\n\n\"I have hope, because God is good and great; because His grace is\nmighty; because it will touch the heart of him who shall deign to hear\nthe prayer of a soul which is truly penitent and deeply convinced;\nbecause my eternal salvation is in the hands of this young man, and he\ncannot wish to avenge himself on me beyond the grave. Moreover, I must\ndie at peace with those I have injured; I must fall at the feet of\nBernard Mauprat and obtain his forgiveness of my sins. My tears will\nmove him, or, if his unrelenting soul despises them, I shall at least\nhave fulfilled an imperious duty.\"\n\nSeeing that he was speaking with a firm conviction that he was being\nheard by me, I was filled with disgust; I thought I could detect the\ndeceit and cowardice that lay beneath this vile hypocrisy. I moved away\nand waited for the abbe some distance off. He soon rejoined me; the\ninterview had ended by a mutual promise to meet again soon. The abbe had\nundertaken to convey the Trappist's words to me, while the latter had\nthreatened in the most honeyed tone in the world to come and see me if I\nrefused his request. The abbe and I agreed to consult together, without\ninforming the chevalier or Edmee, that we might not disquiet them\nunnecessarily. The Trappist had gone to stay at La Chatre, at the\nCarmelite convent; this had thoroughly aroused the abbe's suspicions,\nin spite of his first enthusiasm at the penitence of the sinner. The\nCarmelites had persecuted him in his youth, and in the end the prior\nhad driven him to secularize himself. The prior was still alive, old\nbut implacable; infirm, and withdrawn from the world, but strong in his\nhatred, and his passion for intrigue. The abbe could not hear his name\nwithout shuddering, and he begged me to act prudently in this affair.\n\n\"Although John Mauprat,\" he said, \"is under the bane of the law, and you\nare at the summit of honour and prosperity, do not despise the weakness\nof your enemy. Who knows what cunning and hatred may do? They can usurp\nthe place of the just and cast him out on the dung-heap; they can\nfasten their crimes on others and sully the robe of innocence with their\nvileness. Maybe you have not yet finished with the Mauprats.\"\n\nThe poor abbe did not know that there was so much truth in his words.\n\n\n\n\nXIX\n\nAfter thoroughly reflecting on the Trappist's probable intentions, I\ndecided that I ought to grant him the interview he had requested. In any\ncase, John Mauprat could not hope to impose upon me, and I wished to do\nall in my power to prevent him from pestering my great-uncle's last days\nwith his intrigues. Accordingly, the very next day I betook myself\nto the town, where I arrived towards the end of Vespers. I rang, not\nwithout emotion, at the door of the Carmelites.\n\nThe retreat chosen by the Trappist was of those innumerable mendicant\nsocieties which France supported at that time. Though its rules\nwere ostensibly most austere, this monastery was rich and devoted to\npleasure. In that age of scepticism the small number of the monks was\nentirely out of proportion to the wealth of the establishment which\nhad been founded for them; and the friars who roamed about the vast\nmonasteries in the most remote parts of the provinces led the easiest\nand idlest lives they had ever known, in the lap of luxury, and entirely\nfreed from the control of opinion, which always loses its power when man\nisolates himself. But this isolation, the mother of the \"amiable vices,\"\nas they used to phrase it, was dear only to the more ignorant. The\nleaders were a prey to the painful dreams of an ambition which had been\nnurtured in obscurity and embittered by inaction. To do something, even\nin the most limited sphere and with the help of the feeblest machinery;\nto do something at all costs--such was the one fixed idea of the priors\nand abbes.\n\nThe prior of the Carmelites whom I was about to see was the\npersonification of this restless impotence. Bound to his great arm-chair\nby the gout, he offered a strange contrast to the venerable chevalier,\npale and unable to move like himself, but noble and patriarchal in his\naffliction. The prior was short, stout, and very petulant. The upper\npart of his body was all activity; he would turn his head rapidly from\nside to side; he would brandish his arms while giving orders. He was\nsparing of words, and his muffled voice seemed to lend a mysterious\nmeaning to the most trivial things. In short, one-half of his person\nseemed to be incessantly striving to drag along the other, like the\nbewitched man in the Arabian Nights, whose robe hid a body that was\nmarble up to the waist.\n\nHe received me with exaggerated attention, got angry because they did\nnot bring me a chair quickly enough, stretched out his fat, flabby hand\nto draw this chair quite close to his own, and made a sign to a tall,\nbearded satyr, whom he called the Brother Treasurer, to go out; then,\nafter overwhelming me with questions about my journey, and my return,\nand my health, and my family, while his keen restless little eyes\nwere darting glances at me from under eyelids swollen and heavy from\nintemperance, he came to the point.\n\n\"I know, my dear child,\" he said, \"what brings you here; you wish to\npay your respects to your holy relative, to the Trappist, that model of\nfaith and holiness whom God has sent to us to serve as an example to the\nworld, and reveal to all the miraculous power of grace.\"\n\n\"Prior,\" I answered, \"I am not a good enough Christian to judge of the\nmiracle you mention. Let devout souls give thanks to Heaven for it. For\nmyself, I have come here because M. Jean de Mauprat desires to inform\nme, as he has said, of plans which concern myself, and to which I am\nready to listen. If you will allow me to go and see him----\"\n\n\"I did not want him to see you before myself, young man,\" exclaimed the\nprior, with an affectation of frankness, at the same time seizing my\nhands in his, at the touch of which I could not repress a feeling of\ndisgust. \"I have a favour to ask of you in the name of charity, in the\nname of the blood which flows in your veins . . .\"\n\nI withdrew one of my hands, and the prior, noticing my expression of\ndispleasure, immediately changed his tone with admirable skill.\n\n\"You are a man of the world, I know. You have a grudge against him who\nonce was Jean de Mauprat, and who to-day is the humble Brother Jean\nNepomucene. But if the precepts of our divine Master, Jesus Christ,\ncannot persuade you to pity, there are considerations of public\npropriety and of family pride which must make you share my fears and\nassist my efforts. You know the pious but rash resolution which Brother\nJohn has formed; you ought to assist me in dissuading him from it, and\nyou will do so, I make no doubt.\"\n\n\"Possibly, sir,\" I replied very coldly; \"but might I ask to what my\nfamily is indebted for the interest you are good enough to take in its\naffairs?\"\n\n\"To that spirit of charity which animates all the followers of Christ,\"\nanswered the monk, with very well assumed dignity.\n\nFortified with this pretext, on the strength of which the clergy have\nalways taken upon themselves to meddle in all family secrets, it was not\ndifficult for him to put an end to my questions; and, though he could\nnot destroy the suspicions which I felt at heart, he succeeded in\nproving to my ears that I ought to be grateful to him for the care which\nhe had taken of the honour of my name. I wanted to find out what he was\ndriving at; it was as I had foreseen. My Uncle John claimed from me his\nshare in the fief of Roche-Mauprat; and the prior was deputed to make\nme understand that I had to choose between paying a considerable sum of\nmoney (for he spoke of the interest accruing through the seven years of\npossession, besides a seventh part of the whole estate) and the insane\nstep he intended taking, the scandal of which could not fail to\nhasten the chevalier's death and cause me, perhaps, \"strange personal\nembarrassments.\" All this was hinted with consummate skill under the\ncover of the most Christian solicitude for my own welfare, the most\nfervent admiration for the Trappist's zeal, and the most sincere anxiety\nabout the results of this \"firm resolve.\" Finally, it was made evident\nthat John Mauprat was not coming to ask me for the means of existence,\nbut that I should have to humbly beseech him to accept the half of\nmy possessions, if I wished to prevent him from dragging my name and\nprobably my person to the felon's dock.\n\nI tried a final objection.\n\n\"If,\" I said, \"this resolve of Brother Nepomucene, as you call him, is\nas fixed as you say; if the only one care he has in the world is for his\nown salvation, will you explain to me how the attractions of temporal\nwealth can possibly turn him from it? There seems to be a contradiction\nin this which I fail to understand.\"\n\nThe prior was somewhat embarrassed by the piercing glance I turned\non him, but he immediately started on one of those exhibitions of\nsimplicity which are the supreme resource of rogues:\n\n\"Mon Dieu! my dear son,\" he exclaimed, \"you do not know, then, the\nimmense consolation a pious soul can derive from the possession of\nworldly wealth? Just as perishable riches must be despised when they\nrepresent vain pleasures, even so must they be resolutely defended by\nthe upright man when they afford him the means of doing good. I will\nnot hide from you that if I were the holy Trappist I would not yield my\nrights to any one; I would found a religious society for the propagation\nof the faith and the distribution of alms with the wealth which, in the\nhands of a brilliant young nobleman like yourself, is only squandered on\nhorses and dogs. The Church teaches us that by great sacrifices and\nrich offerings we may cleanse our souls of the blackest sins. Brother\nNepomucene, a prey to holy fear, believes that a public expiation is\nnecessary for his salvation. Like a devout martyr, he wishes to satisfy\nthe implacable justice of men with blood. But how much sweeter for you\n(and safer, at the same time) to see him raise some holy altar to the\nglory of God, and hide in the blessed peace of the cloister the baleful\nlustre of the name he has already abjured! He is so much swayed by the\nspirit of his order, he has conceived such a love for self-denial, for\nhumility and poverty, that it will need all my efforts and much help\nfrom on high to make him agree to this change of expiations.\"\n\n\"It is you, then, prior, who from sheer goodness of heart are\nundertaking to alter this fatal resolution? I admire your zeal, and I\nthank you for it; but I do not think there will be any need of all these\nnegotiations. M. Jean de Mauprat claims his share of the inheritance;\nnothing can be more just. Even should the law refuse all civil rights\nto a man who owed his safety only to flight (a point which I will pass\nover), my relative may rest assured that there would never be the least\ndispute between us on this ground, if I were the absolute possessor\nof any fortune whatever. But you are doubtless aware that I owe the\nenjoyment of this fortune only to the kindness of my great-uncle, the\nChevalier Hubert de Mauprat; that he had enough to do to pay the debts\nof the family, which amounted to more than the total value of the\nestate; that I can alienate nothing without his permission, and that,\nin reality, I am merely the depositary of a fortune which I have not yet\naccepted.\"\n\nThe prior stared at me in astonishment, as if dazed by an unexpected\nblow. Then he smiled with a crafty expression, and said:\n\n\"Very good! It appears that I have been mistaken, and that I must apply\nto M. Hubert de Mauprat. I will do so; for I make no doubt that he will\nbe very grateful to me for saving his family from a scandal which may\nhave very good results for one of his relatives in the next world, but\nwhich, for a certainty, will have very bad ones for another relation in\nthe present world.\"\n\n\"I understand, sir,\" I replied. \"This is a threat. I will answer in the\nsame strain: If M. Jean de Mauprat ventures to importune my uncle and\ncousin, it is with me that he will have to deal; and it will not be\nbefore the courts that I shall summon him to answer for certain outrages\nwhich I have by no means forgotten. Tell him that I shall grant no\npardon to the Trappist penitent unless he remains faithful to the role\nhe has adopted. If M. Jean de Mauprat is without resources, and he asks\nmy help, I may, out of the income I receive, furnish him with the means\nof living humbly and decently, according to the spirit of the vows he\nhas taken; but if ecclesiastical ambition has taken possession of his\nmind, and he thinks, by stupid, childish threats, to intimidate my\nuncle to such an extent that he will be able to extort from him the\nwherewithal to satisfy his new tastes, let him undeceive himself--tell\nhim so from me. The old man's peace of mind and his daughter's future\nhave only myself as guardian, and I shall manage to guard them, though\nit be at the risk of my life and my honour.\"\n\n\"And yet honour and life are of some importance at your age,\" replied\nthe abbe, visibly irritated, but feigning a suaver manner than ever.\n\"Who knows into what folly religious fervour may lead the Trappist?\nFor, between ourselves be it said, my child--you see, I am a man of\nmoderation--I knew the world in my youth, and I do not approve of these\nviolent resolves, which are more often dictated by pride than piety.\nFor instance, I have consented to temper the austerity of our rules; my\nfriars look well-fed, and they wear shirts. Rest assured, my good sir, I\nam far from approving of your uncle's design, and I shall do all that\nis possible to hinder it. Yet, if he still persists, how will my efforts\nprofit you? He has obtained his superior's permission, and may, after\nall, yield to his fatal inspiration. You may be seriously compromised by\nan affair of this kind; for, although reports say that you are a worthy\nyoung gentleman, though you have abjured the errors of the past, and\nthough, perhaps, your soul has always hated iniquity, you have certainly\nbeen involved in many misdeeds which human laws condemn and punish. Who\ncan tell into what involuntary revelations Brother Nepomucene may\nfind himself drawn if he sets in motion the machinery of criminal\nproceedings? Can he set it in motion against himself without at the same\ntime setting it in motion against you? Believe me, I wish for peace--I\nam a kindly man.\"\n\n\"Yes, a very kindly man, father,\" I answered, in a tone of irony. \"I see\nthat perfectly. But do not let this matter cause you needless anxiety;\nfor there is one very clear argument which must reassure both of us. If\na veritable religious impulse urges Brother John the Trappist to make a\npublic reparation, it will be easy to make him understand that he ought\nto hesitate before he drags another than himself into the abyss; the\nspirit of Christ forbids him to do this. But, if the truth is, as I\npresume, that M. Jean de Mauprat has not the least wish to hand himself\nover to justice, his threats are but little calculated to terrify me,\nand I shall take steps to prevent them from making more stir than is\ndesirable.\"\n\n\"So that is the only answer I am to give him?\" asked the prior, darting\na vindictive glance at me.\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" I replied; \"unless he would prefer to come here and receive\nthe answer from my own mouth. I came with a determination to conquer\nthe disgust which his presence arouses in me; and I am astonished that,\nafter expressing so much eagerness to see me, he should remain in the\nbackground when I arrive.\"\n\n\"Sir,\" answered the prior, with ridiculous majesty, \"my duty is to see\nthat the peace of our Lord reigns in this holy place. I must,\ntherefore, set myself against any interview which might lead to violent\nexplanations . . .\"\n\n\"You are much too easily frightened, sir,\" I replied. \"There is nothing\nto arouse passion in this matter. However, as it was not I who called\nfor these explanations, and as I came here out of pure compliance, I\nmost willingly refrain from pushing them further, and I thank you for\nhaving been good enough to act as intermediary.\"\n\nWith that, I made a profound bow and retired.\n\n\n\n\nXX\n\nI gave an account of this interview to the abbe, who was waiting for\nme at Patience's. He was entirely of my own opinion; he thought, like\nmyself, that the prior, so far from endeavouring to turn the Trappist\nfrom his pretended designs, was trying with all his power to frighten\nme, in the hope that I should be brought to make considerable sacrifices\nof money. In his eyes it was clear that this old man, faithful to the\nmonkish spirit, wished to put into the hands of a clerical Mauprat the\nfruit of the labours and thrift of a lay Mauprat.\n\n\"That is the indelible mark of the Catholic clergy,\" he said. \"They\ncannot live without waging war on the families around them, and being\never on the watch for opportunities to spoil them. They look upon this\nwealth as their property, and upon all ways of recovering it as lawful.\nIt is not as easy as you think to protect one's self against this\nsmooth-faced brigandage. Monks have stubborn appetites and ingenious\nminds. Act with caution and be prepared for anything. You can never\ninduce a Trappist to show fight. Under the shelter of his hood, with\nhead bowed and hands crossed, he will accept the cruelest outrages; and,\nknowing quite well that you will not assassinate him, he will hardly\nfear you. Again, you do not know what justice can become in man's\nhands, and how a criminal trial is conducted and decided when one of\nthe parties will not stick at any kind of bribery and intimidation.\nThe Church is powerful, the law grandiloquent. The words 'honesty' and\n'integrity' have for centuries been ringing against the hardened walls\nof courts of justice; but that has not prevented judges from being\nfalse or verdicts from being iniquitous. Have a care; have a care! The\nTrappist may start the cowled pack on his own track and throw them off\nby disappearing at the right point and leading them on yours. Remember\nthat you have wounded many an _amour propre_ by disappointing the\npretensions of the dowry-hunters. One of the most incensed of them,\nand at the same time one of the most malicious, is a near relative of a\nmagistrate who is all-powerful in the province. De la Marche has given\nup the gown for the sword; but among his old colleagues he may have left\nsome one who would like to do you an ill-turn. I am sorry you were not\nable to join him in America, and get on good terms with him. Do not\nshrug your shoulders; you may kill a dozen of them, and things will\ngo from bad to worse. They will avenge themselves; not on your life,\nperhaps, for they know that you hold that cheap, but on your honour; and\nyour great-uncle will die of grief. In short--\"\n\n\"My dear abbe,\" I said, interrupting him, \"you have a habit of seeing\neverything black at the first glance, when you do not happen to see the\nsun in the middle of the night. Now let me tell you some things which\nought to drive out these gloomy presentiments. I know John Mauprat of\nold; he is a signal impostor, and, moreover, the rankest of cowards. He\nwill sink into the earth at the sight of me, and as soon as I speak I\nwill make him confess that he is neither Trappist, nor monk, nor saint.\nAll this is a mere sharper's trick. In the old days I have heard him\nmaking plans which prevent me from being astonished at his impudence\nnow; so I have but little fear of him.\"\n\n\"There you are wrong,\" replied the abbe. \"You should always fear a\ncoward, because he strikes from behind while you are expecting him in\nfront. If John Mauprat were not a Trappist, if the papers he showed me\nwere lies, the prior of the Carmelites is too shrewd and cautious to\nhave let himself be deceived. Never would he have espoused the cause of\na layman, and never would he mistake a layman for one of his own cloth.\nHowever, we must make inquiries; I will write to the superior of the\nTrappist monastery at once, but I am certain he will confirm what I know\nalready. It is even possible that John Mauprat is a genuine devotee.\nNothing becomes such a character better than certain shades of the\nCatholic spirit. The inquisition is the soul of the Church, and the\ninquisition should smile on John Mauprat. I firmly believe that he\nwould give himself up to the sword of justice solely for the pleasure\nof compassing your ruin with his own, and that the desire to found a\nmonastery with your money is a sudden inspiration, the honour of which\nbelongs entirely to the prior of the Carmelites . . .\"\n\n\"That is hardly probable, my dear abbe,\" I said. \"Besides, where can\nthese discussions lead us? Let us act. Let us keep the chevalier in\nsight, so that the unclean beast may not come and poison the calm of his\nlast days. Write to the Trappist superior; I will offer the creature\na pension, and when he comes, let us carefully watch his slightest\nmovements. My sergeant, Marcasse, is an admirable bloodhound. Let us put\nhim on the track, and if he can manage to tell us in vulgar speech what\nhe has seen and heard, we shall soon know everything that is happening\nin the province.\"\n\nChatting thus, we arrived at the chateau towards the close of day. As\nI entered the silent building, I was seized with a fond, childish\nuneasiness, such as may come upon a mother when she leaves her babe a\nmoment. The eternal security which nothing had ever disturbed within the\nbounds of the old sacred walls, the decrepitude of the servants, the way\nin which the doors always stood open, so that beggars would sometimes\nenter the drawing-room without meeting any one and without giving\numbrage--the whole atmosphere of peace and trust and isolation--formed\na strange contrast to the thoughts of strife, and the cares with which\nJohn's return and the prior's threats had filled my mind for some\nhours. I quickened my pace, and, seized with an involuntary trembling, I\ncrossed the billiard-room. At that moment I thought I saw a dark shadow\npass under the windows of the ground floor, glide through the jasmines,\nand disappear in the twilight. I threw open the door of the drawing-room\nand stood still. There was not a sound, not a movement. I was going\nto look for Edmee in her father's room, when I thought I saw something\nwhite moving near the chimney-corner where the chevalier always sat.\n\n\"Edmee! Is that you?\" I exclaimed.\n\nNo one answered. My brow was covered with a cold sweat and my knees\nwere trembling. Ashamed of this strange weakness, I rushed towards the\nhearth, repeating Edmee's name in agonized tones.\n\n\"Have you come at last, Bernard?\" she replied, in a trembling voice.\n\nI seized her in my arms. She was kneeling beside her father's arm-chair\nand pressing to her lips the old man's icy hands.\n\n\"Great God!\" I cried, when by the dim light in the room I could\ndistinguish the chevalier's livid face. \"Is our father dead?\"\n\n\"Perhaps,\" she said, in a stifled voice; \"perhaps he has only fainted,\nplease God! But, a light, for Heaven's sake! Ring the bell! He has only\nbeen in this state for a moment.\"\n\nI rang in all haste. The abbe now came in, and fortunately we succeeded\nin bringing my uncle back to life.\n\nBut when he opened his eyes, his mind seemed to be struggling against\nthe impressions of a fearful dream.\n\n\"Has he gone? Has the vile phantom gone?\" he repeated several times.\n\"Ho, there, Saint-Jean! My pistols! Now, my men! Throw the fellow out of\nthe window!\"\n\nI began to suspect the truth.\n\n\"What has happened?\" I said the Edmee, in a low tone. \"Who has been here\nin my absence?\"\n\n\"If I told you,\" answered Edmee, \"you would hardly believe it. You\nwould think my father and I were mad. But I will tell you everything\npresently; let us attend to him.\"\n\nWith her soft words and loving attentions she succeeded in calming the\nold man. We carried him to his room, and he fell into a quiet sleep.\nWhen Edmee had gently withdrawn her hand from his and lowered the wadded\ncurtain over his head, she joined the abbe and myself, and told us that\na quarter of an hour before we returned a mendicant friar had entered\nthe drawing-room, where, as usual, she was embroidering near her\nfather, who had fallen asleep. Feeling no surprise at an incident\nwhich frequently happened, she had risen to get her purse from the\nmantel-piece, at the same time addressing a few words to the monk. But\njust as she was turning round to offer him an alms the chevalier had\nawakened with a start, and eyeing the monk from head to foot, had cried\nin a tone half of anger and half of fear:\n\n\"What the devil are you doing here in that garb?\"\n\nThereupon Edmee had looked at the monk's face and had recognised . . .\n\n\"A man you would never dream of,\" she said; \"the frightful John Mauprat.\nI had only seen him a single hour in my life, but that repulsive face\nhas never left my memory, and I have never had the slightest attack of\nfever without seeing it again. I could not repress a cry.\n\n\"'Do not be afraid,' he said, with a hideous smile. 'I come here not as\nan enemy, but as a supplicant.'\n\n\"And he went down on his knees so near my father, that, not knowing\nwhat he might do, I rushed between them, and hastily pushed back the\narm-chair to the wall. Then the monk, speaking in a mournful tone, which\nwas rendered still more terrifying by the approach of night, began to\npour out some lamentable rigmarole of a confession, and ended by asking\npardon for his crimes, and declaring that he was already covered by the\nblack veil which parricides wear when they go to the scaffold.\n\n\"'This wretched creature has gone mad,' said my father, pulling the\nbell-rope.\n\n\"But Saint-Jean is deaf, and he did not come. So we had to sit in\nunspeakable agony and listen to the strange talk of the man who calls\nhimself a Trappist and declares that he had come to give himself up to\njustice in expiation of his transgressions. Before doing so, he wished\nto implore my father's forgiveness and his last blessing. While saying\nthis he was moving forward on his knees, and speaking with an intense\npassion. In the sound of this voice, uttering words of extravagant\nhumility, there seemed to be insult and a menace. As he continued moving\nnearer to my father, and as the idea of the foul caresses which he\napparently wished to lavish on him filled me with disgust, I ordered\nhim in a somewhat imperious tone to rise and speak becomingly. My father\nangrily ordered him to say no more and depart; and as at this moment\nhe cried, 'No, you must let me clasp your knees!' I pushed him back to\nprevent him from touching my father. I shudder to think that my glove\nhas touched that unclean gown. He turned towards me, and, though he\nstill feigned penitence and humility, I could see rage gleaming in his\neyes. My father made a violent effort to get up, and in fact he got up,\nas if by a miracle; but the next instant he fell back fainting in his\nchair. Then steps were heard in the billiard-room, and the monk rushed\nout by the glass door with the speed of lightning. It was then that you\nfound me half-dead and frozen with terror at the feet of my prostate\nfather.\"\n\n\"The abominable coward has lost no time, you see, abbe,\" I cried. \"His\naim was to frighten the chevalier and Edmee, and he has succeeded; but\nhe reckoned without me, and I swear that--though he should have to be\ntreated in the Roche-Mauprat fashion--if he ever dares to come here\nagain----\"\n\n\"That is enough, Bernard,\" said Edmee. \"You make me shudder. Speak\nseriously, and tell me what all this means.\"\n\nWhen I had informed her of what had happened to the abbe and myself, she\nblamed us for not warning her.\n\n\"Had I known,\" she said, \"what to expect I should not have been\nfrightened, and I could have taken care never to be left alone in the\nhouse with my father, and Saint-Jean, who is hardly more active. Now,\nhowever, I am no longer afraid; I shall be on my guard. But the best\nthing, Bernard dear, is to avoid all contact with this loathsome man,\nand to make him as liberal an allowance as possible to get rid of him.\nThe abbe is right; he may prove formidable. He knows that our kinship\nwith him must always prevent us from summoning the law to protect us\nagainst his persecutions; and though he cannot injure us as seriously\nas he flatters himself, he can at least cause us a thousand annoyances,\nwhich I am reluctant to face. Throw him gold and let him take himself\noff. But do not leave me again, Bernard; you see you have become\nabsolutely necessary to me; brood no more over the wrong you pretend to\nhave done me.\"\n\nI pressed her hand in mine, and vowed never to leave her, though she\nherself should order me, until this Trappist had freed the country from\nhis presence.\n\nThe abbe undertook the negotiations with the monastery. He went into\nthe town the following day, carrying from me a special message to the\nTrappist that I would throw him out of the window if he ever took it\ninto his head to appear at Sainte-Severe again. At the same time I\nproposed to supply him with money, even liberally, on condition that\nhe would immediately withdraw to his convent or to any other secular\nor religious retreat he might choose, and that he would never again set\nfoot in Berry.\n\nThe prior received the abbe with all the signs of profound contempt and\nholy aversion for his state of heresy. Far from attempting to wheedle\nhim like myself, he told him that he wished to have nothing to do with\nthis business, that he washed his hands of it, and that he would confine\nhimself to conveying the decisions on both sides, and affording a refuge\nto Brother Nepomucene, partly out of Christian charity, and partly to\nedify his monks by the example of a truly devout man. According to him,\nBrother Nepomucene would be the second of that name placed in the front\nrank of the heavenly host by virtue of the canons of the Church.\n\nThe next day the abbe was summoned to the convent by a special\nmessenger, and had an interview with the Trappist. To his great\nsurprise, he found that the enemy had changed his tactics. He\nindignantly refused help of any sort, declaring that his vow of poverty\nand humility would not allow it; and he strongly blamed his dear host,\nthe prior, for daring to suggest, without his consent, an exchange\nof things eternal for things temporal. On other matters he refused to\nexplain his views, and took refuge in ambiguous and bombastic replies.\nGod would inspire him, he said, and at the approaching festival of the\nVirgin, at the august and sublime hour of holy communion, he expected to\nhear the voice of Jesus speaking to his heart and announcing the line of\nconduct he ought to follow. The abbe was afraid of betraying uneasiness,\nif he insisted on probing this \"Christian mystery,\" so he returned with\nthis answer, which was least of all calculated to reassure me. He did\nnot appear again either at the castle or in the neighbourhood, and kept\nhimself so closely shut up in the convent that few people ever saw his\nface. However, it soon became known, and the prior was most active in\nspreading the news, that John Mauprat had been converted to the most\nzealous and exemplary piety, and was now staying at the Carmelite\nconvent for a term, as a penitent from La Trappe. Every day they\nreported some fresh virtuous trait, some new act of austerity of this\nholy personage. Devotees, with a thirst for the marvellous, came to see\nhim, and brought him a thousand little presents, which he obstinately\nrefused. At times he would hide so well that people said he had returned\nto his monastery; but just as we were congratulating ourselves on\ngetting rid of him, we would hear that he had recently inflicted some\nterrible mortifications on himself in sackcloth and ashes; or else that\nhe had gone barefooted on a pilgrimage into some of the wildest and most\ndesolate parts of Varenne. People went so far as to say that he could\nwork miracles. If the prior had not been cured of his gout, that was\nbecause, in a spirit of true penitence, he did not wish to be cured.\n\nThis state of uncertainty lasted almost two months.\n\n\n\n\nXXI\n\nThese days, passed in Edmee's presence, were for me days of delight, yet\nof suffering. To see her at all hours, without fear of being indiscreet,\nsince she herself would summon me to her side, to read to her, talk with\nher on all subjects, share the loving attentions she bestowed on her\nfather, enter into half her life exactly as if we had been brother\nand sister--this was great happiness, no doubt, but it was a dangerous\nhappiness, and again the volcano kindled in my breast. A few confused\nwords, a few troubled glances betrayed me. Edmee was by no means blind,\nbut she was impenetrable; her dark and searching eyes, fixed on me as\non her father, with the solicitude of an absorbing affection, would at\ntimes suddenly grow cold, just as the violence of my passion was ready\nto break out. Her countenance would then express nothing but patient\ncuriosity and an unswerving resolve to read to the bottom of my soul\nwithout letting me see even the surface of her own.\n\nMy sufferings, though acute, were dear to me at first; it pleased me to\nthink that I was secretly offering them to Edmee as an expiation of my\npast faults. I hoped that she would perceive this and be satisfied with\nme. She saw it, and said nothing. My agony grew more intense; but still\nsome days passed before I lost all power to hide it. I say days, because\nwhoever has loved a woman, and has been much alone with her, yet always\nkept in check by her severity, must have found days like centuries. How\nfull life seemed and yet how consuming! What languor and unrest! What\ntenderness and rage! It was as though the hours were years; and at this\nvery day, if I did not bring in dates to rectify the error of my memory,\nI could easily persuade myself that these two months filled half my\nlife.\n\nPerhaps, too, I should like to persuade myself of this, in order to find\nsome excuse for the foolish and culpable conduct into which I fell in\nspite of all the good resolutions which I had but lately formed. The\nrelapse was so sudden and complete that I should still blush at the\nthought, if I had not cruelly atoned for it, as you will soon see.\n\nAfter a night of agony, I wrote her an insane letter which came nigh to\nproducing terrible consequences for me; it was somewhat as follows:\n\n\"You do not love me, Edmee; you will never love me. I know this; I\nask for nothing, I hope for nothing. I would only remain near you and\nconsecrate my life to your service and defence. To be useful to you\nI will do all that my strength will allow; but I shall suffer, and,\nhowever I try to hide it, you will see it; and perhaps you will\nattribute to wrong causes the sadness I may not be able to suppress with\nuniform heroism. You pained me deeply yesterday, when you advised me to\ngo out a little 'to distract my thoughts.' To distract my thoughts from\nyou, Edmee! What bitter mockery! Do not be cruel, sister; for then you\nbecome my haughty betrothed of evil days again . . . and, in spite of\nmyself, I again become the brigand whom you used to hate. . . . Ah, if\nyou knew how unhappy I am! In me there are two men who are incessantly\nwaging a war to the death. It is to be hoped that the brigand will fall;\nbut he defends himself step by step, and he cries aloud because he feels\nhimself covered with wounds and mortally stricken. If you knew, Edmee,\nif you only knew what struggles, what conflicts, rend my bosom; what\ntears of blood my heart distils; and what passions often rage in that\npart of my nature which the rebel angels rule! There are nights when I\nsuffer so much that in the delirium of my dreams I seem to be plunging\na dagger into your heart, and thus, by some sombre magic, to be forcing\nyou to love me as I love you. When I awake, in a cold sweat, bewildered,\nbeside myself, I feel tempted to go and kill you, so as to destroy the\ncause of my anguish. If I refrain from this, it is because I fear that\nI should love you dead with as much passion and tenacity as if you were\nalive. I am afraid of being restrained, governed, swayed by your image\nas I am by your person. Then, again, a man cannot destroy the being he\nloves and fears; for when she has ceased to exist on earth she still\nexists in himself. It is the lover's soul which serves as a coffin for\nhis mistress and which forever preserves her burning remains, that it\nmay feed on them without ever consuming them. But, great Heaven! what is\nthis tumult in my thoughts? You see, Edmee, to what an extent my mind is\nsick; take pity on me, then. Bear with me, let me be sad, never doubt my\ndevotion. I am often mad, but I worship you always. A word, a look from\nyou, will always recall me to a sense of duty, and this duty will be\nsweet when you deign to remind me of it. As I write to you, Edmee, the\nsky is full of clouds that are darker and heavier than lead; the thunder\nis rumbling, and doleful ghosts of purgatory seem to be floating in\nthe glare of the lightning. The weight of the storm lies on my soul; my\nbewildered mind quivers like the flashes which leap from the firmament.\nIt seems as if my whole being were about to burst like the tempest. Ah,\ncould I but lift up to you a voice like unto its voice! Had I the power\nto lay bare the agonies and passions which rend me within! Often, when a\nstorm has been sweeping over the great oaks above, you have told me\nthat you enjoy gazing upon the fury of the one and the resistance of the\nother. This, you say, is a battle of mighty forces; and in the din in\nthe air you fancy you can detect the curses of the north wind and the\nmournful cries of the venerable branches. Which suffers the more, Edmee,\nthe tree which resists, or the wind which exhausts itself in the attack?\nIs it not always the wind that yields and falls? And then the sky,\ngrieved at the defeat of her noble son, sheds a flood of tears upon\nthe earth. You love these wild images, Edmee; and whenever you behold\nstrength vanquished by resistance you smile cruelly, and there is a look\nin your inscrutable eyes that seems to insult my misery. Well, you have\ncast me to the ground, and, though shattered, I still suffer; yes,\nlearn this, since you wish to know it, since you are merciless enough\nto question me and to feign compassion. I suffer, and I no longer try\nto remove the foot which the proud conqueror has placed on my broken\nheart.\"\n\nThe rest of this letter, which was very long, very rambling and absurd\nfrom beginning to end, was in the same strain. It was not the first time\nthat I had written to Edmee, though I lived under the same roof, and\nnever left her except during the hours of rest. My passion possessed me\nto such a degree that I was irresistibly drawn to encroach upon my sleep\nin order to write to her, I could never feel that I had talked enough\nabout her, that I had sufficiently renewed my promises of submission--a\nsubmission in which I was constantly failing. The present letter,\nhowever, was more daring and more passionate than any of the others.\nPerhaps, in some mysterious way, it was written under the influence of\nthe storm which was rending the heavens while I, bent over my table,\nwith moist brow and dry, burning hand, drew this frenzied picture of my\nsufferings. A great calm, akin to despair, seemed to come over me as\nI threw myself upon my bed after going down to the drawing-room and\nslipping my letter into Edmee's work-basket. Day was breaking, and the\nhorizon showed heavy with the dark wings of the storm, which was flying\nto other regions. The trees, laden with rain, were tossing under the\nbreeze, which was still blowing freshly. Profoundly sad, but blindly\nresigned to my suffering, I fell asleep with a sense of relief, as if I\nhad made a sacrifice of my life and hopes. Apparently Edmee did not find\nmy letter, for she gave me no answer. She generally replied verbally,\nand these letters of mine were a means of drawing from her those\nprofessions of sisterly friendship with which I had perforce to be\nsatisfied, and which, at least, poured soothing balm into my wound.\nI ought to have known that this time my letter must either lead to a\ndecisive explanation, or be passed over in silence. I suspected the abbe\nof having taken it and thrown it into the fire; I accused Edmee of scorn\nand cruelty; nevertheless, I held my tongue.\n\nThe next day the weather was quite settled again. My uncle went for a\ndrive, and during the course of it told us that he should not like to\ndie without having had one last great fox-hunt. He was passionately\ndevoted to this sport, and his health had so far improved that he again\nbegan to show a slight inclination for pleasure and exercise. Seated in\na very light, narrow _berline_, drawn by strong mules, so that he might\nmove rapidly over the sandy paths in our woods, he had already followed\none or two little hunts which we had arranged for his amusement. Since\nthe Trappist's visit, the chevalier had entered, as it were, upon a\nfresh term of life. Endowed with strength and pertinacity, like all his\nrace, it seemed as if he had been decaying for want of excitement, for\nthe slightest demand on his energy immediately set his stagnant blood\nin motion. As he was very much pleased with this idea of a hunt, Edmee\nundertook to organize, with my help, a general battue and to join in the\nsport herself. One of the greatest delights of the good old man was\nto see her on horseback, as she boldly pranced around his carriage and\noffered him all the flowering sprigs which she plucked from the bushes\nshe passed. It was arranged that I should ride with her, and that\nthe abbe should accompany the chevalier in the carriage. All the\ngamekeepers, foresters, huntsmen, and even poachers of Varenne were\ninvited to this family function. A splendid meal was prepared with many\ngoose-pies and much local wine. Marcasse, whom I had made my manager\nat Roche-Mauprat, and who had a considerable knowledge of the art of\nfox-hunting, spent two whole days in stopping up the earths. A few young\nfarmers in the neighbourhood, interested in the battue and able to give\nuseful advice, graciously offered to join the party; and, last of all,\nPatience, in spite of his aversion for the destruction of innocent\nanimals, consented to follow the hunt as a spectator. On the appointed\nday, which opened warm and cloudless on our happy plans and my own\nimplacable destiny, some fifty individuals met with horns, horses, and\nhounds. At the end we were to play havoc with the rabbits, of which\nthere were too many on the estate. It would be easy to destroy them\nwholesale by falling back upon that part of the forest which had not\nbeen beaten during the hunt. Each man therefore armed himself with a\ncarbine, and my uncle also took one, to shoot from his carriage, which\nhe could still do with much skill.\n\nEdmee was mounted on a very spirited Limousin mare, which she amused\nherself by exciting and quieting with a touching coquetry to please her\nold father. For the first two hours she hardly left the carriage at all,\nand the chevalier, now full of new life, gazed on her with smiles and\ntears of love. Just as in the daily rotation of our globe, ere passing\ninto night, we take leave of the radiant orb which is going to reign\nover another hemisphere, even so did the old man find some consolation\nfor his death in the thought that the youth and vigour and beauty of his\ndaughter were surviving him for another generation.\n\nWhen the hunt was in full swing, Edmee, who certainly inherited some of\nthe martial spirit of the family, and the calmness of whose soul\ncould not always restrain the impetuosity of her blood, yielded to\nher father's repeated signs--for his great desire now was to see her\ngallop--and went after the field, which was already a little distance\nahead.\n\n\"Follow her! follow her!\" cried the chevalier, who had no sooner seen\nher galloping off than his fond paternal vanity had given place to\nuneasiness.\n\nI did not need to be told twice; and digging my spurs into my horse's\nflanks, I rejoined Edmee in a cross-path which she had taken to come up\nwith the hunt. I shuddered as I saw her bending like a reed under the\nbranches, while her horse, which she was still urging on, carried her\nbetween the trees with the rapidity of lightning.\n\n\"For God's sake, Edmee,\" I cried, \"do not ride so fast! You will be\nkilled!\"\n\n\"Let me have a gallop,\" she said gaily. \"My father has allowed me. You\nmust not interfere; I shall rap you on the knuckles if you try to stop\nmy horse.\"\n\n\"At least let me follow you, then,\" I said, keeping close to her.\n\"Your father wished it; and I shall at least be there to kill myself if\nanything happens to you.\"\n\nWhy I was filled with these gloomy forebodings I do not know, for I had\noften seen Edmee galloping through the woods. I was in a peculiar\nstate; the heat of noon seemed mounting to my brain, and my nerves were\nstrangely excited. I had eaten no breakfast, as I had felt somewhat out\nof sorts in the morning, and, to sustain myself, had swallowed several\ncups of coffee mixed with rum. At first I experienced a horrible\nsense of fear; then, after a few minutes, the fear gave way to an\ninexpressible feeling of love and delight. The excitement of the gallop\nbecame so intense that I imagined my only object was to pursue Edmee.\nTo see her flying before me, as light as her own black mare, whose feet\nwere speeding noiselessly over the moss, one might have taken her for a\nfairy who had suddenly appeared in this lonely spot to disturb the mind\nof man and lure him away to her treacherous haunts. I forgot the hunt\nand everything else. I saw nothing but Edmee; then a mist fell upon\nmy eyes, and I could see her no more. Still, I galloped on; I was in a\nstate of silent frenzy, when she suddenly stopped.\n\n\"What are we doing?\" she said. \"I cannot hear the hunt any longer, and\nhere is the river in front. We have come too far to the left.\"\n\n\"No, no, Edmee,\" I answered, without knowing in the least what I was\nsaying. \"Another gallop and we shall be there.\"\n\n\"How red you are!\" she said. \"But how shall we cross the river?\"\n\n\"Since there is a road, there must be a ford,\" I replied. \"Come on! come\non!\"\n\nI was filled with an insane desire to go on galloping, I believe my idea\nwas to plunge deeper and deeper into the forest with her; but this idea\nwas wrapped in a haze, and when I tried to pierce it, I was conscious of\nnothing but a wild throbbing of my breast and temples.\n\nEdmee made a gesture of impatience.\n\n\"These woods are accursed!\" she said. \"I am always losing my way in\nthem.\"\n\nNo doubt she was thinking of the fatal day when she had been carried far\nfrom another hunt and brought to Roche-Mauprat. I thought of it too,\nand the ideas that came into my mind produced a sort of dizziness. I\nfollowed her mechanically towards the river. Suddenly I realized that\nshe was on the other bank. I was filled with rage on seeing that her\nhorse was cleverer and braver than my own. Before I could get the animal\nto take the ford, which was rather a nasty one, Edmee was a long way\nahead of me again. I dug my spurs into its sides till the blood streamed\nfrom them. At last, after being nearly thrown several times, I reached\nthe other bank, and, blind with rage, started in pursuit of Edmee. I\novertook her, and seizing the mare's bridle, I exclaimed:\n\n\"Stop, Edmee, I say! You shall not go any farther.\"\n\nAt the same time I shook the reins so violently that her horse reared.\nShe lost her balance, and, to avoid falling, jumped lightly to the\nground between our two animals, at the risk of being hurt. I was on\nthe ground almost as soon as herself. I at once pushed the horses away.\nEdmee's, which was very quiet, stopped and began to browse. Mine bolted\nout of sight. All this was the affair of an instant.\n\nI had caught Edmee in my arms; she freed herself and said, in a sharp\ntone:\n\n\"You are very brutal, Bernard; and I hate these ways of yours. What is\nthe matter with you?\"\n\nPerplexed and confused, I told her that I thought her mare was bolting,\nand that I was afraid some accident might happen to her if she allowed\nherself to be carried away by the excitement of the ride.\n\n\"And to save me,\" she replied, \"you make me fall, at the risk of killing\nme! Really, that was most considerate of you.\"\n\n\"Let me help you to mount again,\" I said.\n\nAnd without waiting for her permission, I took her in my arms and lifted\nher off the ground.\n\n\"You know very well that I do not mount in this way!\" she exclaimed, now\nquite irritated. \"Leave me alone; I don't want your help.\"\n\nBut I was no longer in a state to obey her. I was losing my head;\nmy arms were tightening around her waist, and it was in vain that I\nendeavoured to take them away. My lips touched her bosom in spite of\nmyself. She grew pale with anger.\n\n\"Oh, how unfortunate I am!\" I said, with my eyes full of tears; \"how\nunfortunate I am to be always offending you, and to be hated more and\nmore in proportion as my love for you grows greater!\"\n\nEdmee was of an imperious and violent nature. Her character, hardened by\ntrials, had every year developed greater strength. She was no longer the\ntrembling girl making a parade of courage, but in reality more ingenuous\nthan bold, whom I had clasped in my arms at Roche-Mauprat. She was now a\nproud, fearless woman, who would have let herself be killed rather than\ngive the slightest countenance to an audacious hope. Besides, she was\nnow the woman who knows that she is passionately loved and is conscious\nof her power. She repulsed me, therefore, with scorn; and as I followed\nher distractedly, she raised her whip and threatened to leave a mark of\nignominy on my face if I dared to touch even her stirrup.\n\nI fell on my knees and begged her not to leave me thus without forgiving\nme. She was already in her saddle, and, as she looked round for the way\nback, she exclaimed:\n\n\"That was the one thing wanting--to behold this hateful spot again! Do\nyou see where we are?\"\n\nI looked in my turn, and saw that we were on the edge of the forest,\nquite close to the shady little pond at Gazeau. A few yards from\nus, through the trees which had grown denser since Patience left, I\nperceived the door of the tower, opening like a big black mouth behind\nthe green foliage.\n\nI was seized with a fresh dizziness. A terrible struggle was taking\nplace between two instincts. Who shall explain the mysterious workings\nof man's brain when his soul is grappling with the senses, and one part\nof his being is striving to strangle the other? In an organization like\nmine, such a conflict, believe me, was bound to be terrible; and do not\nimagine that the will makes but a feeble resistance in natures carried\naway by passion; it is idiotic to say to a man who lies spent with such\nstruggles, \"You ought to have conquered yourself.\"\n\n\n\n\nXXII\n\nHow shall I describe to you what I felt at the unexpected sight of\nGazeau Tower? I had seen it but twice in my life; each time I had taken\npart in a painfully stirring scene there. Yet these scenes were as\nnaught beside the one awaiting me on this third encounter; there must be\na curse on certain places.\n\nI fancied I could still see the blood of the two Mauprats sprinkled on\nthe shattered door. Their life of crime and their tragic end made me\nshudder at the violent instincts which I felt in myself. I was filled\nwith a horror of my own feelings, and I understood why Edmee did not\nlove me. But, as if yonder deplorable blood had power to stir a\nfatal sympathy, I felt the wild strength of my passion increasing in\nproportion as my will made greater efforts to subdue it. I had trampled\ndown all other passions; scarcely a trace of them remained in me. I was\nsober; if not gentle and patient, I was at least capable of affection\nand sympathy; I had a profound sense of the laws of honour, and the\nhighest respect for the dignity of others. Love, however, was still the\nmost formidable of my enemies; for it was inseparably connected with all\nthat I had acquired of morality and delicacy; it was the tie that\nbound the old man to the new, an indissoluble tie, which made it almost\nimpossible for me to find the golden mean between reason and passion.\n\nStanding before Edmee, who was about to leave me behind and on foot;\nfurious at seeing her escape me for the last time (since after the\ninsult I had just offered her she would doubtless never run the risk of\nbeing alone with me again), I gazed on her with a terrible expression.\nI was livid; my fists were clinched. I had but to resolve, and the\nslightest exertion of my strength would have snatched her from her\nhorse, thrown her to the ground and left her at the mercy of my desires.\nI had but to let my old savage instincts reign for a second and I could\nhave slaked, extinguished the fires which had been consuming me for\nseven years. Never did Edmee know the danger her honour ran in that\nminute of agony, and never have I ceased to feel remorse for it; but\nGod alone shall be my Judge, for I triumphed, and this was the last\nevil thought of my life. In this thought, moreover, lay the whole of my\ncrime; the rest was the work of fate.\n\nFilled with fear, I suddenly turned my back on her and, wringing\nmy hands in despair, hastened away by the path which had brought me\nthither. I cared little where I went; I only knew that I had to tear\nmyself away from perilous temptations. It was a broiling day; the odour\nof the woods seemed intoxicating; the mere sight of them was stirring\nup the instincts of my old savage life; I had to flee or fall. With an\nimperious gesture, Edmee ordered me to depart from her presence. The\nidea that any danger could possibly threaten her except from myself\nnaturally did not come into my head or her own. I plunged into the\nforest. I had not gone more than thirty paces when I heard the report\nof a gun from the spot where I had left Edmee. I stopped, petrified with\nhorror; why, I know not; for in the middle of a battue the report of a\ngun was by no means extraordinary; but my soul was so sorrowful that it\nseemed ready to find fresh woe in everything. I was about to retrace my\nsteps and rejoin Edmee at the risk of offending her still more when I\nthought I heard the moaning of a human being in the direction of Gazeau\nTower. I rushed forward, and then fell upon my knees, as if stunned by\nemotion. It took me some minutes to recover; my brain seemed full\nof doleful sights and sounds; I could no longer distinguish between\nillusion and reality; though the sun was shining brightly I began to\ngrope my way among the trees. All of a sudden I found myself face to\nface with the abbe; he was anxiously looking for Edmee. The chevalier\nhad driven to a certain spot to watch the field pass, and not seeing his\ndaughter, had been filled with apprehension. The abbe had plunged into\nthe forest at once, and, soon finding the tracks of our horses, had come\nto see what had happened to us. He had heard the gun, but had thought\nnothing of it. Seeing me pale and apparently dazed, with my hair\ndisarranged, and without either horse or gun (I had let mine fall on the\nspot where I had half fainted, and had not thought of picking it up),\nhe was as terrified as myself; nor did he know any more than I for what\nreason.\n\n\"Edmee!\" he said to me, \"where is Edmee?\"\n\nI made a rambling reply. He was so alarmed at seeing me in such a\nstate that he felt secretly convinced I had committed some crime, as he\nsubsequently confessed to me.\n\n\"Wretched boy!\" he said, shaking me vigorously by the arm to bring me to\nmy senses. \"Be calm; collect your thoughts, I implore you! . . .\"\n\nI did not understand a word, but I led him towards the fatal spot; and\nthere--a sight never to be forgotten--Edmee was lying on the ground\nrigid and bathed in blood. Her mare was quietly grazing a few yards\naway. Patience was standing by her side with his arms crossed on his\nbreast, his face livid, and his heart so full that he was unable to\nanswer a word to the abbe's cries and sobs. For myself, I could not\nunderstand what was taking place. I fancy that my brain, already\nbewildered by my previous emotions, must have been completely paralyzed.\nI sat down on the ground by Edmee's side. She had been shot in the\nbreast in two places. I gazed on her lifeless eyes in a state of\nabsolute stupor.\n\n\"Take away that creature,\" said Patience to the abbe, casting a look of\ncontempt on me. \"His perverse nature is what it always was.\"\n\n\"Edmee, Edmee!\" cried the abbe, throwing himself upon the grass and\nendeavouring to stanch the blood with his handkerchief.\n\n\"Dead, dead!\" said Patience. \"And there is the murderer! She said so as\nshe gave up her pure soul to God; and Patience will avenge her! It is\nvery hard; but it must be so! It is God's will, since I alone was here\nto learn the truth.\"\n\n\"Horrible, horrible!\" exclaimed the abbe.\n\nI heard the sound of this last word, and with a smile I repeated it like\nan echo.\n\nSome huntsmen now appeared. Edmee was carried away. I believe that I\ncaught sight of her father walking without help. However, I should not\ndare to affirm that this was not a mere extravagant vision (for I had no\ndefinite consciousness of anything, and these awful moments have left\nin my mind nothing but vague memories, as of a dream), had I not been\nassured that the chevalier got out of the carriage without any help,\nwalked about, and acted with as much presence of mind as a young man.\nOn the following day he fell into a state of absolute dotage and\ninsensibility, and never rose from his arm-chair again.\n\nBut what happened to myself? I do not know. When I recovered my\nreason, I found that I was in another part of the forest near a little\nwaterfall, to the murmur of which I was listening mechanically with a\nsort of vague delight. Blaireau was asleep at my feet, while his master,\nleaning against a tree, was watching me attentively. The setting sun\nwas sending shafts of ruddy gold between the slender stems of the young\nash-trees; the wild flowers seemed to be smiling at me; and birds were\nwarbling sweet melodies. It was one of the most beautiful days of the\nyear.\n\n\"What a gorgeous evening!\" I said to Marcasse. \"This spot is as\nbeautiful as an American forest. Well, old friend, what are you doing\nthere? You ought to have awakened me sooner. I have had such hideous\ndreams.\"\n\nMarcasse came and knelt down beside me; two streams of tears were\nrunning down his withered, sallow cheeks. On his face, usually so\nimpassive, there was an ineffable expression of pity and sorrow and\naffection.\n\n\"Poor master!\" he said, \"delirium, head bad, that's all. Great\nmisfortune! But fidelity not changed. Always with you; if need be, ready\nto die with you.\"\n\nHis tears and words filled me with sadness; but this was owing to an\ninstinctive sympathy enhanced by the weak state of my nerves, for I\ndid not remember a thing. I threw myself into his arms and wept like\nhimself; he pressed me to his bosom, as a father might his son. I was\nfully conscious that some frightful misfortune had overtaken me, but\nI was afraid to learn what it was, and nothing in the world would have\ninduced me to ask him.\n\nHe took me by the arm and led me through the forest. I let myself be\ntaken like a child. Then a fresh sense of weariness came over me, and he\nwas obliged to let me sit down again for half an hour. At last he lifted\nme up and succeeded in leading me to Roche-Mauprat, where we arrived\nvery late. I do not know what happened to me during the night. Marcasse\ntold me subsequently that I had been very delirious. He took upon\nhimself to send to the nearest village for a barber, who bled me early\nin the morning, and a few minutes later I recovered my reason.\n\nBut what a frightful service they seemed to have done me. Dead! Dead!\nDead! This was the only word I could utter. I did nothing but groan and\ntoss about on my bed. I wanted to get up and run to Sainte-Severe. My\npoor sergeant would throw himself at my feet, or plant himself in front\nof the door to prevent me. To keep me back, he would tell me various\nthings which I did not in the least understand. However, his manifest\nsolicitude for me and my own feeling of exhaustion made me yield, though\nI could not explain his conduct. In one of these struggles my vein\nopened again, and I returned to bed before Marcasse noticed it.\nGradually I sank into a deep swoon, and I was almost dead when, seeing\nmy blue lips and purple cheeks, he took it into his head to lift up the\nbed-clothes, and found me lying in a pool of blood.\n\nHowever, this was the most fortunate thing that could have happened to\nme. For several days I remained in a state of prostration in which there\nwas but little difference between my waking and sleeping hours. Thanks\nto this, I understood nothing, and therefore did not suffer.\n\nOne morning, having managed to make me take a little nourishment, and\nnoticing that with my strength my melancholy and anxiety were returning,\nMarcasse announced, with a simple, genuine delight, that Edmee was not\ndead, and that they did not despair of saving her. These words fell upon\nme like a thunderbolt; for I was still under the impression that this\nfrightful adventure was a delusion of my delirium. I began to shout and\nto brandish my arms in a terrible manner. Marcasse fell on his knees by\nmy bed and implored me to be calm, and a score of times he repeated the\nfollowing words, which to me were like the meaningless words one hears\nin dreams:\n\n\"You did not do it on purpose; I know well enough. No, you did not do it\non purpose. It was an accident; a gun going off in your hand by chance.\"\n\n\"Come, now, what do you mean?\" I exclaimed impatiently. \"What gun? What\naccident? What have I to do with it?\"\n\n\"Don't you know, then, sir, how she was hit?\"\n\nI passed my hands over my brow as if to bring back to my mind the energy\nof life, and as I had no clear recollection of the mysterious event\nwhich had unhinged it, I thought that I was mad, and remained silent and\ndismayed, fearful lest any word should escape to betray the loss of my\nfaculties.\n\nAt last, little by little, I collected my thoughts. I asked for some\nwine, as I felt weak; and no sooner had I drunk a few drops than all the\nscenes of the fatal day unrolled themselves before me as if by magic.\nI even remembered the words that I had heard Patience utter immediately\nafter the event. It was as if they had been graven in that part of the\nmemory which preserves the sound of words, even when the other part\nwhich treasures up their sense is asleep. For one more moment I was\nuncertain; I wondered if my gun could have gone off in my hands just\nas I was leaving Edmee. I distinctly remembered firing it at a pewit\nan hour before, for Edmee had wanted to examine the bird's plumage.\nFurther, when I heard the shot which had hit her, my gun was in my\nhands, and I had not thrown it down until a few seconds later, so it\ncould not have been this weapon which had gone off on falling. Besides,\neven granting a fatality which was incredible, I was much too far from\nEdmee at that moment to have shot her. Finally, I had not a single\nbullet on me throughout the day; and it was impossible for my gun to\nhave been loaded, unknown to myself, since I had not unslung it after\nkilling the pewit.\n\nQuite convinced, therefore, that I was not the cause of the hideous\naccident, it remained to me to find an explanation of this crushing\ncatastrophe. To me it was perfectly simple; some booby with a gun, I\nthought, must have caught sight of Edmee's horse through the branches\nand mistaken it for a wild beast; and I did not dream of accusing any\none of a deliberate attempt at murder. I discovered, however, that I was\naccused myself. I drew the truth from Marcasse. He informed me that the\nchevalier and all the people who took part in the hunt had attributed\nthe misfortune to a pure accident, their opinion being that, to my great\nsorrow, my gun had gone off when my horse threw me, for it was believed\nthat I had been thrown. This was practically the view they all took. In\nthe few words that Edmee had been able to utter she seemed to confirm\nthe supposition. Only one person accused me, and that was Patience; but\nhe had accused me before none but his two friends, Marcasse and the Abbe\nAubert, and then only after pledging them to secrecy.\n\n\"There is no need,\" added Marcasse, \"for me to tell you that the abbe\nmaintains an absolute silence, and refuses to believe that you are\nguilty. As for myself, I swear to you that I shall never--\"\n\n\"Stop! stop!\" I said. \"Do not tell me even that; it would imply\nthat some one in the world might actually believe it. But Edmee said\nsomething extraordinary to Patience just as she was dying; for she is\ndead; it is useless for you to try to deceive me. She is dead, and I\nshall never see her again.\"\n\n\"She is not dead!\" cried Marcasse.\n\nAnd his solemn oaths convinced me, for I knew that he would have tried\nin vain to lie; his simple soul would have risen in revolt against\nhis charitable intentions. As for Edmee's words, he frankly refused\nto repeat them; from which I gathered that their testimony seemed\noverwhelming. Thereupon I dragged myself out of bed, and stubbornly\nresisted all Marcasse's efforts to keep me back; I had the farmer's\nhorse saddled and started off at a gallop. I staggered into the\ndrawing-room without meeting any one except Saint-Jean, who uttered\na cry of terror on seeing me, and rushed off without answering my\nquestions.\n\nThe drawing-room was empty. Edmee's embroidery frame, buried under the\ngreen cloth, which her hand, perchance, would never lift again, seemed\nto me like a bier under its pall. My uncle's big arm-chair was no\nlonger in the chimney-corner. My portrait, which I had had painted in\nPhiladelphia and had sent over during the American war, had been taken\ndown from the wall. These were signs of death and malediction.\n\nI left this room with all haste and went upstairs with the courage of\ninnocence, but with despair in my soul. I waled straight to Edmee's\nroom, knocked, and entered at once. Mademoiselle Leblanc was coming\ntowards the door; she gave a loud scream and ran away, hiding her face\nin her hands as if she had seen a wild beast. Who, then, could have been\nspreading hideous reports about me? Had the abbe been disloyal enough\nto do so? I learnt later that Edmee, though generous and unshaken in her\nlucid moments, had openly accused me in her delirium.\n\nI approached her bed and, half delirious myself, forgetting that my\nsudden appearance might be a deathblow to her, I pulled the curtains\naside with an eager hand and gazed on her. Never have I seen more\nmarvellous beauty. Her big dark eyes had grown half as large again;\nthey were shining with an extraordinary brilliancy, though without any\nexpression, like diamonds. Her drawn, colourless cheeks, and her lips,\nas white as her cheeks, gave her the appearance of a beautiful marble\nhead. She looked at me fixedly, with as little emotion as if she had\nbeen looking at a picture or a piece of furniture; then, turning her\nface slightly towards the wall, she said, with a mysterious smile:\n\n\"This is the flower they call _Edmea sylvestris_.\"\n\nI fell upon my knees; I took her hand; I covered it with kisses; I\nbroke into sobs. But she gave no heed; her hand remained in mine icy and\nstill, like a piece of alabaster.\n\n\n\n\nXXIII\n\nThe abbe came in and greeted me in a cold and sombre manner. Then he\nmade a sign to me, and drawing me away from the bed, said:\n\n\"You must be mad! Return at once; and if you are wise, you will remain\naway. It is the only thing left for you to do.\"\n\n\"And since when,\" I cried, flying into a passion, \"have you had the\nright to drive me out of the bosom of my family?\"\n\n\"Alas! you have no longer a family,\" he answered, with an accent of\nsorrow that somewhat disarmed me. \"What were once father and daughter\nare now naught but two phantoms, whose souls are already dead and whose\nbodies soon will be. Show some respect for the last days of those who\nloved you.\"\n\n\"And how can I show my respect and grief by quitting them?\" I replied,\nquite crushed.\n\n\"On this point,\" said the abbe, \"I neither wish nor ought to say\nanything; for you know that your presence here is an act of rashness and\na profanation. Go away. When they are no more (and the day cannot be far\ndistant), if you have any claims to this house, you may return, and\nyou will certainly not find me here to contest them or affirm them.\nMeanwhile, as I have no knowledge of these claims, I believe I may take\nupon myself to see that some respect is paid to the last hours of these\ntwo holy people.\"\n\n\"Wretched man!\" I said, \"I do not know what prevents me from tearing you\nto pieces! What abominable impulse urges you to be everlastingly turning\nthe dagger in my breast? Are you afraid that I may survive this blow?\nCannot you see that three coffins will be taken out together from this\nhouse? do you imagine that I have come here for aught but a farewell\nlook and a farewell blessing?\"\n\n\"You might say a farewell pardon,\" replied the abbe, in a bitter tone,\nand with a gesture of merciless condemnation.\n\n\"What I say is that you are mad!\" I cried, \"and that if you were not a\npriest, this hand of mine should crush the life out of you for daring to\nspeak to me in this way.\"\n\n\"I have but little fear of you, sir,\" he rejoined. \"To take my life\nwould be doing me a great service; but I am sorry that your threats and\nanger should lend weight to the charges under which you lie. If I\nsaw that you were moved to penitence, I would weep with you; but your\nassurance fills me with loathing. Hitherto, I had seen in you nothing\nworse than a raging lunatic; to-day I seem to see a scoundrel. Begone,\nsir!\"\n\nI fell into an arm-chair, choking with rage and anguish. For a moment I\nhoped that I was about to die. Edmee was dying by my side, and before me\nwas a judge so firmly convinced of my guilt that his usual gentle, timid\nnature had become harsh and pitiless. The imminent loss of her I loved\nwas hurrying me into a longing for death. Yet the horrible charge\nhanging over me began to rouse my energies. I did not believe that such\nan accusation could stand for a single instant against the voice of\ntruth. I imagined that one word from me, one look, would be sufficient\nto make it fall to the ground; but I felt so dazed, so deeply wounded,\nthat this means of defence was denied me. The more grievously the\ndisgrace of such a suspicion weighed upon my mind, the more clearly\nI realized that it is almost impossible for a man to defend himself\nsuccessfully when his only weapon is the pride of slandered innocence.\n\nI sat there overwhelmed, unable to utter a word. It seemed as if a\ndome of lead were weighing on my skull. Suddenly the door opened and\nMademoiselle Leblanc approached me stiffly; in a tone full of hatred\nshe informed me that some one outside wished to speak to me. I went out\nmechanically, and found Patience waiting with his arms folded, in his\nmost dignified attitude, and with an expression on his face which would\nhave compelled both respect and fear if I had been guilty.\n\n\"Monsieur de Mauprat,\" he said, \"I must request you to grant me a\nprivate interview. Will you kindly follow me to my cottage?\"\n\n\"Yes, I will,\" I replied. \"I am ready to endure any humiliation, if only\nI can learn what is wanted of me and why you are all pleased to insult\nthe most unfortunate of men. Lead the way, Patience, and go quickly; I\nam eager to return here.\"\n\nPatience walked in front of me with an impassive air. When we arrived\nat his little dwelling, we found my poor sergeant, who had just arrived\nlikewise. Not finding any horse on which he could follow me, and not\nwishing to quit me, he had come on foot, and so quickly that he was\nbathed in perspiration. Nevertheless, the moment he saw us he sprang\nup full of life from the bench on which he had thrown himself under the\nbower of vine-branches, and came to meet us.\n\n\"Patience!\" he cried, in a dramatic style which would have made me smile\nhad it been possible for me to display a glimmer of mirth at such a\nmoment. \"Old fool! . . . Slanderer at your age? . . . Fie, sir! . . .\nRuined by good fortune . . . you are . . . yes.\"\n\nPatience, impassive as ever, shrugged his shoulders and said to his\nfriend:\n\n\"Marcasse, you do not know what you are saying. Go and rest awhile at\nthe bottom of the orchard. This matter does not concern you. I want to\nspeak to your master alone. I wish you to go,\" he added, taking him by\nthe arm; and there was a touch of authority in his manner to which the\nsergeant, in spite of his ticklish prided, yielded from instinct and\nhabit.\n\nAs soon as we were alone Patience proceeded to the point; he began by a\nseries of questions to which I resolved to submit, so that I might the\nmore quickly obtain some light on the state of affairs around me.\n\n\"Will you kindly inform me, monsieur,\" he said, \"what you purpose doing\nnow?\"\n\n\"I purpose remaining with my family,\" I answered, \"as long as I have\na family; and when this family is no more, what I shall do concerns no\none.\"\n\n\"But, sir,\" replied Patience, \"if you were told that you could not\nremain under the same roof with them without causing the death of one or\nthe other, would you persist in staying?\"\n\n\"If I were convinced that this was so,\" I rejoined, \"I would not appear\nin their presence. I would remain at their door and await the last\nday of their life, or the first day of their renewed health, and again\nimplore a love I have not yet ceased to deserve.\"\n\n\"Ah, we have come to this!\" said Patience, with a smile of contempt. \"I\nshould not have believed it. However, I am very glad; it makes matters\nclearer.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" I cried. \"Speak, you wretch! Explain yourself!\"\n\n\"You are the only wretch here,\" he answered coldly, at the same time\nsitting down on the one stool in the cottage, while I remained standing\nbefore him.\n\nI wanted to draw an explanation from him, at all costs. I restrained my\nfeelings; I even humbled myself so far as to say that I should be ready\nto accept advice, if he would consent to tell me the words that Edmee\nhad uttered immediately after the event, and those which she had\nrepeated in her hours of delirium.\n\n\"That I will not,\" replied Patience sternly; \"you are not worthy to hear\nany words from that mouth, and I shall certainly never repeat them to\nyou. Why do you want to know them? Do you hope to hide anything from men\nhereafter? God saw you; for Him there are no secrets. Leave this place;\nstay at Roche-Mauprat; keep quiet there; and when your uncle is dead and\nyour affairs are settled, leave this part of the country. If you take my\nadvice, you will leave it this very day. I do not want to put the law on\nyour track, unless your actions force me. But others besides myself,\nif they are not certain of the truth, have at least a suspicion of\nit. Before two days have passed a chance word said in public, the\nindiscretion of some servant, may awaken the attention of justice, and\nfrom that point to the scaffold, when a man is guilty, is but a single\nstep. I used not to hate you; I even had a liking for you; take this\nadvice, then, which you say you are ready to follow. Go away at once, or\nremain in hiding and ready for flight. I do not desire your ruin; Edmee\nwould not desire it either--so--do you understand?\"\n\n\"You must be insane to think that I could listen to such advice. I, hide\nmyself! or flee like a murderer! You can't dream of that! Come on!\ncome on! I defy the whole of you! I know not what fury and hatred are\nfretting you and uniting you all against me; I know not why you want to\nkeep me from seeing my uncle and cousin; but I despise your follies.\nMy place is here; I shall not quit it except by order of my cousin or\nuncle; and this order, too, I must take from their own lips; I cannot\nallow sentence to be brought me by any outsider. So, thanks for your\nwisdom, Monsieur Patience; in this case my own will suffice. I am your\nhumble servant, sir.\"\n\nI was preparing to leave the cottage when he rushed in front of me, and\nfor a moment I saw that he was ready to use force to detain me. In spite\nof his advanced age, in spite of my height and strength, he might still\nhave been a match, perhaps more than a match, for me in a struggle of\nthis kind. Short, bent, broad-shouldered, he was a Hercules.\n\nHe stopped, however, just as he was about to lay hands on me, and,\nseized with one of those fits of deep tenderness to which he was subject\nin his moments of greatest passion, he gazed at me with eyes of pity,\nand said, in a gentle tone:\n\n\"My poor boy! you whom I loved as a son (for I looked upon you as\nEdmee's brother), do not hasten to your ruin. I beseech you in the\nname of her whom you have murdered, and whom you still love--I can see\nit--but whom you may never behold again. Believe me, but yesterday your\nfamily was a proud vessel, whose helm was in your hands; to-day it is\na drifting wreck, without either sail or pilot--left to be handled\nby cabinboys, as friend Marcasse says. Well, my poor mariner, do not\npersist in drowning yourself; I am throwing you a rope; take it--a day\nmore, and it may be too late. Remember that if the law gets hold of you,\nthe man who is trying to save you to-day, to-morrow will be obliged to\nappear against you and condemn you. Do not compel me to do a thing the\nvery thought of which brings tears to my eyes. Bernard, you have been\nloved, my lad; even to-day you may live on the past.\"\n\nI burst into tears, and the sergeant, who returned at this moment, began\nto weep also; he implored me to go back to Roche-Mauprat; but I soon\nrecovered and, thrusting them both away, said:\n\n\"I know that both of you are excellent men, and both most generous; you\nmust have some love for me too, since, though you believe me blackened\nwith a hideous crime, you can still think of saving my life. But have no\nfears on my account, good friends; I am innocent of this crime, and my\none wish is that the matter may be fully investigated, so that I may be\nacquitted--yes, this is inevitable, I owe it to my family to live until\nmy honour has been freed from stain. Then, if I am condemned to see my\ncousin die, as I have no one in the world to love but her, I will blow\nmy brains out. Why, then, should I be downcast? I set little store by\nmy life. May God make the last hours of her whom I shall certainly not\nsurvive painless and peaceful--that is all I ask of Him.\"\n\nPatience shook his head with a gloomy, dissatisfied expression. He was\nso convinced of my crime that all my denials only served to alienate his\npity. Marcasse still loved me, though he thought I was guilty. I had no\none in the world to answer for my innocence, except myself.\n\n\"If you persist on returning to the chateau,\" exclaimed Patience, \"you\nmust swear before you leave that you will not enter your cousin's room,\nor your uncle's, without the abbe's permission.\"\n\n\"What I swear is that I am innocent,\" I replied, \"and that I will\nallow no man to saddle me with a crime. Back, both of you! Let me pass!\nPatience, if you consider it your duty to denounce me, go and do so. All\nthat I ask is that I may not be condemned without a hearing; I prefer\nthe bar of justice to that of mere opinion.\"\n\nI rushed out of the cottage and returned to the chateau. However, not\nwishing to make a scandal before the servants, and knowing quite well\nthat they could not hide Edmee's real condition from me, I went and shut\nmyself up in the room I usually occupied.\n\nBut in the evening, just as I was leaving it to get news of the two\npatients, Mademoiselle Leblanc again told me that some one wished to\nspeak with me outside. I noticed that her face betrayed a sense of joy\nas well as fear. I concluded that they had come to arrest me, and I\nsuspected (rightly, as it transpired) that Mademoiselle Leblanc had\ndenounced me. I went to the window, and saw some of the mounted police\nin the courtyard.\n\n\"Good,\" I said; \"let my destiny take its course.\"\n\nBut, before quitting, perhaps forever, this house in which I was\nleaving my soul, I wished to see Edmee again for the last time. I walked\nstraight to her room. Mademoiselle Leblanc tried to throw herself in\nfront of the door; I pushed her aside so roughly that she fell, and, I\nbelieve, hurt herself slightly. She immediately filled the house with\nher cries; and later, in the trial, made a great pother about what she\nwas pleased to call an attempt to murder her. I at once entered Edmee's\nroom; there I found the abbe and the doctor. I listened in silence to\nwhat the latter was saying. I learnt that the wounds in themselves were\nnot mortal, that they would not even be very serious, had not a violent\ndisturbance in the brain complicated the evil and made him fear tetanus.\nThis frightful word fell upon me like a death sentence. In America I had\nseen many men die of this terrible malady, the result of wounds received\nin the war. I approached the bed. The abbe was so alarmed that he did\nnot think of preventing me. I took Edmee's hand, cold and lifeless, as\never. I kissed it a last time, and, without saying a single word to the\nothers, went and gave myself up to the police.\n\n\n\n\nXXIV\n\nI was immediately thrown into prison at La Chatre. The public prosecutor\nfor the district of Issoudun took in hand this case of the attempted\nmurder of Mademoiselle de Mauprat, and obtained permission to have\na monitory published on the morrow. He went to the village of\nSainte-Severe, and then to the farms in the neighbourhood of the Curat\nwoods, where the event had happened, and took the depositions of more\nthan thirty witnesses. Then, eight days after I had been arrested, the\nwrit of arrest was issued. If my mind had been less distracted, or if\nsome one had interested himself in me, this breach of the law and\nmany others that occurred during the trial might have been adduced as\npowerful arguments in my favour. They would at least have shown that the\nproceedings were inspired by some secret hatred. In the whole course of\nthe affair an invisible hand directed everything with pitiless haste and\nseverity.\n\nThe first examination had produced but a single indictment against me;\nthis came from Mademoiselle Leblanc. The men who had taken part in the\nhunt declared that they knew nothing, and had no reason to regard the\noccurrence as a deliberate attempt at murder. Mademoiselle Leblanc,\nhowever, who had an old grudge against me for certain jokes I had\nventured to make at her expense, and who, moreover, had been suborned,\nas I learned afterward, declared that Edmee, on recovering from her\nfirst swoon, at a time when she was quite calm and in full possession of\nher reason, had confided to her, under a pledge of secrecy, that she had\nbeen insulted, threatened, dragged from her horse, and finally shot by\nme. This wicked old maid, putting together the various revelations\nthat Edmee had made in her delirium, had, cleverly enough, composed a\nconnected narrative, and added to it all the embellishments that hatred\ncould suggest. Distorting the incoherent words and vague impressions of\nher mistress, she declared upon oath that Edmee had seen me point the\nbarrel of my carbine at her, with the words, \"As I swore, you shall die\nby my hand.\"\n\nSaint-Jean, who was examined the same day, declared that he knew nothing\nbeyond what Mademoiselle Leblanc had told him that evening, and his\ndeposition was very similar to hers. He was honest enough, but dull and\nnarrow-minded. From love of exactness, he omitted no trifling detail\nwhich might be interpreted against me. He asserted that I had always\nbeen subject to pains in the head, during which I lost my senses; that\nseveral times previously, when my nerves were disordered, I had spoken\nof blood and murder to some individual whom I always fancied I could\nsee; and, finally, that my temper was so violent that I was \"capable of\nthrowing the first thing that came to hand at any one's head, though\nas a fact I had never, to his knowledge, committed any excess of this\nkind.\" Such are the depositions that frequently decide life and death in\ncriminal cases.\n\nPatience could not be found on the day of this inquiry. The abbe\ndeclared that his ideas on the occurrence were so vague that he would\nundergo all the penalties inflicted on recalcitrant witnesses rather\nthan express his opinion before fuller investigations had been made.\nHe requested the public prosecutor to give him time, promising on his\nhonour that he would not resist the demands of justice, and representing\nthat at the end of a few days, by inquiring into certain things, he\nwould probably arrive at a conviction of some sort; in this event he\nundertook to speak plainly, either for or against me. This delay was\ngranted.\n\nMarcasse simply said that if I had inflicted the wounds on Mademoiselle\nde Mauprat, about which he was beginning to feel very doubtful, I had at\nleast inflicted them unintentionally; on this he was prepared to stake\nhis honour and his life.\n\nSuch was the result of the first inquiry. It was resumed at various\ntimes during the following days, and several false witnesses swore\nthat they had seen me shoot Mademoiselle de Mauprat, after vainly\nendeavouring to make her yield to my wishes.\n\nOne of the most baneful instruments of ancient criminal procedure was\nwhat was known as the monitory; this was a notice from the pulpit, given\nout by the bishop and repeated by all vicars to their parishioners,\nordering them to make inquiries about the crime in question, and to\nreveal all the facts which might come to their knowledge. This was\nmerely a modified form of the inquisitorial principle which reigned more\nopenly in other countries. In the majority of cases, the monitory, which\nhad, as a fact, been instituted in order to encourage informers in the\nname of religion, was a marvel of ridiculous atrocity; it frequently set\nforth the crime and all the imaginary circumstances the plaintiffs were\neager to prove; it was, in short, the publication of a ready-made case,\nwhich gave the first knave that came a chance of earning some money\nby making a lying deposition in favour of the highest bidder. The\ninevitable effect of the monitory, when it was drawn up with a bias,\nwas to arouse public hatred against the accused. The devout especially,\nreceiving their opinions ready-made from the clergy, pursued the victim\nwithout mercy. This is what happened in my own case; but here the clergy\nof the province were playing a further secret part which almost decided\nmy fate.\n\nThe case was taken to the assizes at the court of Bourges, and\nproceedings began in a very few days.\n\nYou can imagine the gloomy despair with which I was filled. Edmee's\ncondition was growing more and more serious; her mind was completely\nunhinged. I felt no anxiety as to the result of the trial; I never\nimagined it was possible to convict me of a crime I had not committed;\nbut what were honour and life to me, if Edmee were never to regain the\npower of recognising my innocence? I looked upon her as already dead,\nand as having cursed me dying! So I was inflexibly resolved to kill\nmyself immediately after receiving my sentence, whatever it might be.\nUntil then I felt that it was my duty to live, and to do what might be\nnecessary for the triumph of truth; but I was plunged in such a state\nof stupor that I did not even think of ascertaining what was to be\ndone. Had it not been for the cleverness and zeal of my counsel, and the\nsublime devotion of Marcasse, my listlessness would have left me to the\nmost terrible fate.\n\nMarcasse spent all his time in expeditions on my behalf. In the evening\nhe would come and throw himself on a bundle of straw at the foot of my\ntrunkle bed, and, after giving me news of Edmee and the chevalier,\nwhom he went to see every day, he would tell me the results of his\nproceedings. I used to grasp his hand affectionately; but I was\ngenerally so absorbed by the news he had just given me of Edmee, that I\nnever heard anything further.\n\nThis prison of La Chatre had formerly been the stronghold of the\nElevains of Lombaud, the seigneurs of the province. Nothing was left of\nit but a formidable square tower at the top of a ravine where the Indre\nforms a narrow, winding valley, rich with the most beautiful vegetation.\nThe weather was magnificent. My room, situated at the top of the tower,\nreceived the rays of the rising sun, which cast the long, thin shadows\nof a triple row of poplars as far as the eye could see. Never did\nlandscape more smiling, fresh, and pastoral offer itself to the eyes\nof a prisoner. But how could I find pleasure in it? Words of death and\ncontumely came to me in every breeze that blew through the wall-flowers\ngrowing in the crannies. Every rustic sound, every tune on the pipe that\nrose to my room, seemed to contain an insult or to proclaim profound\ncontempt for my sorrow. There was nothing, even to the bleating of\nthe flocks, which did not appear to me an expression of neglect or\nindifference.\n\nFor some time Marcasse had had one fixed idea, namely, that Edmee had\nbeen shot by John Mauprat. It was possible; but as there was no evidence\nto support the conjecture, I at once ordered him not to make known his\nsuspicions. It was not for me to clear myself at the expense of others.\nAlthough John Mauprat was capable of anything, it was possible that he\nhad never thought of committing this crime; and as I had not heard him\nspoken of for more than six weeks, it seemed to me that it would have\nbeen cowardly to accuse him. I clung to the belief that one of the men\nin the battue had fired at Edmee by mistake, and that a feeling of fear\nand shame prevented him from confessing his misadventure. Marcasse had\nthe courage to go and see all those who had taken part in the hunt, and,\nwith such eloquence as Heaven had granted him, implored them not to fear\nthe penalty for unintentional murder, and not to allow an innocent man\nto be accused in their stead. All these efforts were fruitless; from\nnone of the huntsmen did my poor friend obtain a reply which left him\nany nearer a solution of the mystery that surrounded us.\n\nOn being transferred to Bourges, I was thrown into the castle which had\nbelonged to the old dukes of Berry; this was henceforth to be my prison.\nIt was a great grief to me to be separated from my faithful sergeant. He\nwould have been allowed to follow me, but he had a presentiment that he\nwould soon be arrested at the suggestion of my enemies (for he persisted\nin believing that I was the victim of a plot), and thus be unable\nto serve me any more. He wished, therefore, to lose no time, and to\ncontinue his investigations as long as they \"should not have seized his\nperson.\"\n\nTwo days after my removal to Bourges, Marcasse produced a document\nwhich had been drawn up at his instance by two notaries of La Chatre. It\ncontained the depositions of ten witnesses to the effect that for some\ndays before the attempted assassination, a mendicant friar had been\nprowling about Varenne; that he had appeared in different places very\nclose together; and, notably, that he had slept at Notre-Dame de Poligny\nthe night before the event. Marcasse maintained that this monk was John\nMauprat. Two women declared that they had thought they recognised him\neither as John or Walter Mauprat, who closely resembled him. But Walter\nhad been found drowned the day after the capture of the keep; and the\nwhole town of La Chatre, on the day when Edmee was shot, had seen the\nTrappist engaged with the Carmelite prior from morning till night in\nconducting the procession and services for the pilgrimage of Vaudevant.\nThese depositions, therefore, so far from being favourable to me,\nproduced a very bad effect, and threw odium on my defence. The Trappist\nconclusively proved his alibi, and the prior of the Carmelites helped\nhim to spread a report that I was a worthless villain. This was a time\nof triumph for John Mauprat; he proclaimed aloud that he had come to\ndeliver himself up to his natural judges to suffer punishment for his\ncrimes in the past; but no one could think of prosecuting such a holy\nman. The fanaticism that he inspired in our eminently devout province\nwas such that no magistrate would have dared to brave public opinion by\nproceeding against him. In his own depositions, Marcasse gave an\naccount of the mysterious and inexplicable appearance of the Trappist\nat Roche-Mauprat, the steps he had taken to obtain an interview with M.\nHubert and his daughter, his insolence in entering and terrifying them\nin their drawing-room, and the efforts the Carmelite prior had made to\nobtain considerable sums of money from me on behalf of this individual.\nAll these depositions were treated as fairy tales, for Marcasse admitted\nthat he had not seen the Trappist in any of the places mentioned, and\nneither the chevalier nor his daughter was able to give evidence. It\nis true that my answers to the various questions put to me confirmed\nMarcasse's statements; but as I declared in all sincerity that for\nsome two months the Trappist had given me no cause for uneasiness or\ndispleasure, and as I refused to attribute the murder to him, it seemed\nfor some days as if he would be forever reinstated in public opinion. My\nlack of animosity against him did not, however, diminish that which my\njudges showed against me. They made use of the arbitrary powers which\nmagistrates had in bygone days, especially in remote parts of the\nprovinces, and they paralyzed all my lawyer's efforts by a fierce haste.\nSeveral legal personages, whose names I will not menton, indulged,\neven publicly, in a strain of invective against me which ought to have\nexcluded them from any court dealing with questions of human dignity and\nmorality. They intrigued to induce me to confess, and almost went so far\nas to promise me a favourable verdict if I at least acknowledged that I\nhad wounded Mademoiselle de Mauprat accidently. The scorn with which\nI met these overtures alienated them altogether. A stranger to all\nintrigue, at a time when justice and truth could not triumph except by\nintrigue, I was a victim of two redoubtable enemies, the Church and the\nLaw; the former I had offended in the person of the Carmelite prior; and\nthe latter hated me because, of the suitors whom Edmee had repulsed, the\nmost spiteful was a man closely related to the chief magistrate.\n\nNevertheless, a few honest men to whom I was almost unknown, took an\ninterest in my case on account of the efforts of others to make my name\nodious. One of them, a Monsieur E----, who was not without influence,\nfor he was the brother of the sheriff of the province and acquainted\nwith all the deputies, rendered me a service by the excellent\nsuggestions he made for throwing light on this complicated affair.\n\nPatience, convinced as he was of my guilt, might have served my enemies\nwithout wishing to do so; but he would not. He had resumed his roaming\nlife in the woods, and, though he did not hide, could never be found.\nMarcasse was very uneasy about his intentions and could not understand\nhis conduct at all. The police were furious to find that an old man was\nmaking a fool of them, and that without going beyond a radius of a few\nleagues. I fancy that the old fellow, with his habits and constitution,\ncould have lived for years in Varenne without falling into their hands,\nand, moreover, without feeling that longing to surrender which a sense\nof _ennui_ and the horror of solitude so frequently arouse, even in\ngreat criminals.\n\n\n\n\nXXV\n\nThe day of the public trial came. I went to face it quite calmly; but\nthe sight of the crowd filled me with a profound melancholy. No support,\nno sympathy for me there! It seemed to me that on such an occasion\nI might at least have looked for that show of respect to which the\nunfortunate and friendless are entitled. Yet, on all the faces around\nI saw nothing but a brutal and insolent curiosity. Girls of the lower\nclasses talked loudly of my looks and my youth. A large number of women\nbelonging to the nobility or moneyed classes displayed their brilliant\ndresses in the galleries, as if they had come to some _fete_. A great\nmany monks showed their shaven crowns in the middle of the populace,\nwhich they were inciting against me; from their crowded ranks I could\nfrequently catch the words \"brigand,\" \"ungodly,\" and \"wild beast.\" The\nmen of fashion in the district were lolling on the seats of honour, and\ndiscussing my passion in the language of the gutter. I saw and heard\neverything with that tranquility which springs from a profound disgust\nof life; even as a traveller who has come to the end of his journey, may\nlook with indifference and weariness on the eager bustle of those who\nare setting off for a more distant goal.\n\nThe trial began with that emphatic solemnity which at all times has\nbeen associated with the exercise of judicial power. My examination was\nshort, in spite of the innumerable questions that were asked me about\nmy whole life. My answers singularly disappointed the expectations\nof public curiosity, and shortened the trial considerably. I confined\nmyself to three principal replies, the substance of which I never\nchanged. Firstly, to all questions concerning my childhood and\neducation, I replied that I had not come into the defendant's dock to\naccuse others. Secondly, to those bearing on Edmee, the nature of my\nfeeling for her, and my relations with her, I replied that Mademoiselle\nde Mauprat's worth and reputation could not permit even the simplest\nquestion as to the nature of her relations with any man whatever; and\nthat, as to my feelings for her, I was accountable for them to no one.\nThirdly, to those which were designed to make me confess my pretended\ncrime, I replied that I was not even the unwilling author of the\naccident. In brief answers I gave some details of the events immediately\npreceding it; but, feeling that I owed it to Edmee as much as to myself\nto be silent about the tumultuous impulses that had stirred me, I\nexplained the scene which had resulted in my quitting her, as being due\nto a fall from my horse; and that I had been found some distance from\nher body was, I said, because I had deemed it advisable to run after my\nhorse, so that I might again escort her. Unfortunately all this was not\nvery clear, and, naturally, could not be. My horse had gone off in the\ndirection opposite to that which I said; and the bewildered state\nin which I had been found before I knew of the accident, was not\nsufficiently explained by a fall from my horse. They questioned me\nespecially about the gallop I had had with my cousin through the wood,\ninstead of following the hunt as we had intended; they would not believe\nthat we had gone astray, guided altogether by chance. It was impossible,\nthey said, to look upon chance as a reasonable being, armed with a gun,\nwaiting for Edmee at Gazeau Tower at an appointed time, in order to\nshoot her the moment I turned my back for five minutes. They pretended\nthat I must have taken her to this out-of-the-way spot either by craft\nor force to outrage her; and that I had tried to kill her either from\nrage at not succeeding, or from fear of being discovered and punished\nfor my crime.\n\nThen all the witnesses for and against me were heard. It is true\nthat among the former Marcasse was the only one who could really be\nconsidered as a witness for the defence. The rest merely affirmed that\na \"monk bearing a resemblance to the Mauprats\" had been roaming about\nVarenne at the period in question, and that he had even appeared to hide\nhimself on the evening of the event. Since then he had not been seen.\nThese depositions, which I had not solicited, and which I declared had\nnot been taken at my request, caused me considerable astonishment; for\namong the witnesses who made them I saw some of the most honest folk in\nthe country. However, they had no weight except in the eyes of Monsieur\nE----, the magistrate, who was really interested in discovering the\ntruth. He interposed, and asked me how it was that M. Jean de Mauprat\nhad not been summoned to confront these witnesses, seeing that he\nhad taken the trouble to put in his affidavit to prove an alibi. This\nobjection was received with a murmur of indignation. There were not\na few people, however, who by no means looked upon John Mauprat as a\nsaint; but they took no interest in myself, and had merely come to the\ntrial as to a play.\n\nThe enthusiasm of the bigots reached a climax when the Trappist suddenly\nstood up in the crowd. Throwing back his cowl in a theatrical manner,\nhe boldly approached the bar, declaring that he was a miserable sinner\nworthy of all scorn, but on this occasion, when it was the duty of every\none to strive for truth, he considered it incumbent on him to set\nan example of simple candour by voluntarily offering himself for any\nexamination which might shed light on the judges' minds. These\nwords were greeted with applause. The Trappist was admitted to the\nwitness-box, and confronted with the witnesses, who all declared,\nwithout any hesitation, that the monk they had seen wore the same habit\nas this man, and that there was a family likeness, a sort of distant\nresemblance between the two; but that it was not the same person--on\nthis point they had not the least doubt.\n\nThe result of this incident was a fresh triumph for the Trappist. No one\nseemed to notice that, as the witnesses had displayed so much candour,\nit was difficult to believe that they had not really seen another\nTrappist. At this moment I remembered that, at the time of the abbe's\nfirst interview with John Mauprat at the spring at Fougeres, the\nlatter had let fall a few words about a friar of the same order who was\ntravelling with him, and had passed the night at the Goulets farm. I\nthought it advisable to mention this fact to my counsel. He discussed it\nin a low voice with the abbe, who was sitting among the witnesses. The\nlatter remembered the circumstance quite clearly, but was unable to add\nany further details.\n\nWhen it came to the abbe's turn to give evidence he looked at me with\nan expression of agony; his eyes filled with tears, and he answered the\nformal questions with difficulty, and in an almost inaudible voice. He\nmade a great effort to master himself, and finally he gave his evidence\nin these words:\n\n\"I was driving in the woods when M. le Chevalier Hubert de Mauprat\nrequested me to alight, and see what had become of his daughter, Edmee,\nwho had been missing from the field long enough to cause him uneasiness.\nI ran for some distance, and when I was about thirty yards from Gazeau\nTower I found M. Bernard de Mauprat in a state of great agitation. I\nhad just heard a gun fired. I noticed that he was no longer carrying his\ncarbine; he had thrown it down (discharged, as has been proved), a few\nyards away. We both hastened to Mademoiselle de Mauprat, whom we found\nlying on the ground with two bullets in her. Another man had reached her\nbefore us and was standing near her at this moment. He alone can make\nknown the words he heard from her lips. She was unconscious when I saw\nher.\"\n\n\"But you heard the exact words from this individual,\" said the\npresident; \"for rumour has it that there is a close friendship between\nyourself and the learned peasant known as Patience.\"\n\nThe abbe hesitated, and asked if the laws of conscience were not in\nthis case at variance with the laws of the land; and if the judges had\na right to ask a man to reveal a secret intrusted to his honour, and to\nmake him break his word.\n\n\"You have taken an oath here in the name of Christ to tell the truth,\nthe whole truth,\" was the reply. \"It is for you to judge whether this\noath is not more solemn than any you may have made previously.\"\n\n\"But, if I had received this secret under the seal of the confessional,\"\nsaid the abbe, \"you certainly would not urge me to reveal it.\"\n\n\"I believe, Monsieur l'Abbe,\" said the president, \"that it is some time\nsince you confessed any one.\"\n\nAt this unbecoming remark I noticed an expression of mirth on John\nMauprat's face--a fiendish mirth, which brought back to me the man as I\nknew him of old, convulsed with laughter at the sight of suffering and\ntears.\n\nThe annoyance which the abbe felt at this personal attack gave him the\ncourage which might otherwise have been wanting. He remained for a few\nmoments with downcast eyes. They thought that he was humiliated; but,\nas soon as he raised his head, they saw his eyes flashing with the\nmalicious obstinacy of the priest.\n\n\"All things considered,\" he said, in the most gentle tone, \"I think that\nmy conscience bids me keep this secret; I shall keep it.\"\n\n\"Aubert,\" said the King's advocate, angrily, \"you are apparently unaware\nof the penalties which the law inflicts on witnesses who behave as you\nare doing.\"\n\n\"I am aware of them,\" replied the abbe, in a still milder tone.\n\n\"Doubtless, then, you do not intend to defy them?\"\n\n\"I will undergo them if necessary,\" rejoined the abbe, with an\nimperceptible smile of pride, and such a dignified bearing that all the\nwomen were touched.\n\nWomen are excellent judges of things that are delicately beautiful.\n\n\"Very good,\" replied the public prosecutor. \"Do you intend to persist in\nthis course of silence?\"\n\n\"Perhaps,\" replied the abbe.\n\n\"Will you tell us whether, during the days that followed this attempt to\nmurder Mademoiselle de Mauprat, you were in a position to hear the words\nshe uttered, either during her delirium or during her lucid intervals?\"\n\n\"I can give you no information on that point,\" answered the abbe. \"It\nwould be against my inclinations, and, moreover, in my eyes, an outrage\non propriety, to repeat words which, in the case of delirium, could\nprove absolutely nothing, and, if uttered in a lucid moment, could only\nhave been the outpouring of a genuinely filial affection.\"\n\n\"Very good,\" said the King's advocate, rising. \"We shall call upon the\nCourt to deliberate on your refusal of evidence, taking this incident in\nconnection with the main question.\"\n\n\"And I,\" said the president, \"in virtue of my discretionary power, do\norder that Aubert be meanwhile arrested and taken to prison.\"\n\nThe abbe allowed himself to be led away with unaffected calmness. The\nspectators were filled with respect, and a profound silence reigned\nin court, in spite of the bitter efforts of the monks and cures, who\ncontinued to revile the heretic in an undertone.\n\nWhen the various witnesses had been heard (and I must say that those\nwho had been suborned played their part very feebly in public), to crown\nall, Mademoiselle Leblanc appeared. I was surprised to find the old maid\nso bitter against me and able to turn her hatred to such account. In\ntruth, the weapons she could bring against me were only too powerful.\nIn virtue of the right which domestics claim to listen at doors and\noverhear family secrets, this skilled misinterpreter and prolific liar\nhad learnt and shaped to her own purposes most of the facts in my\nlife which could be utilized for my ruin. She related how, seven years\nbefore, I had arrived at the chateau of Sainte-Severe with Mademoiselle\nde Mauprat, whom I had rescued from the roughness and wickedness of my\nuncles.\n\n\"And let that be said,\" she added, turning toward John Mauprat with a\npolite bow, \"without any reference to the holy man in this court, who\nwas once a great sinner, and is now a great saint. But at what a price,\"\nshe continued, facing the judges again, \"had this miserable bandit saved\nmy dear mistress! He had dishonoured her, gentlemen; and, throughout the\ndays that followed, the poor young lady had abandoned herself to grief\nand shame on account of the violence which had been done her, for which\nnothing could bring consolation. Too proud to breath her misfortune to\na single soul, and too honest to deceive any man, she broke off her\nengagement with M. de la Marche, whom she loved passionately, and who\nreturned her passion. She refused every offer of marriage that was\nmade her, and all from a sense of honour, for in reality she hated M.\nBernard. At first she wanted to kill herself; indeed, she had one of her\nfather's little hunting-knives sharpened and (M. Marcasse can tell you\nthe same, if he chooses to remember) she would certainly have killed\nherself, if I had not thrown this knife into the well belonging to the\nhouse. She had to think, too, of defending herself against the night\nattacks of her persecutor; and, as long as she had this knife, she\nalways used to put it under her pillow; every night she would bolt the\ndoor of her room; and frequently I have seen her rush back, pale and\nready to faint, quite out of breath, like a person who has just been\npursued and had a great fright. When this gentleman began to receive\nsome education, and learn good manners, mademoiselle, seeing that she\ncould never have any other husband, since he was always talking of\nkilling any man who dared to present himself, hoped he would get rid of\nhis fierceness, and was most kind and good to him. She even nursed him\nduring his illness; not that she liked and esteemed him as much as M.\nMarcasse was pleased to say in his version; but she was always afraid\nthat in his delirium he might reveal, either to the servants or her\nfather, the secret of the injury he had done her. This her modesty and\npride made her most anxious to conceal, as all the ladies present will\nreadily understand. When the family went to Paris for the winter of '77,\nM. Bernard became jealous and tyrannical and threatened so frequently\nto kill M. de la Marche that mademoiselle was obliged to send the latter\naway. After that she had some violent scenes with Bernard, and declared\nthat she did not and never would love him. In his rage and grief--for\nit cannot be denied that he was enamoured of her in his tigerish\nfashion--he went off to America, and during the six years he spent there\nhis letters seemed to show that he had much improved. By the time he\nreturned, mademoiselle had made up her mind to be an old maid, and had\nbecome quite calm again. And M. Bernard, too, seemed to have grown into\na fairly good young gentleman. However, through seeing her every day\nand everlastingly leaning over the back of her arm-chair, or winding\nher skeins of wool and whispering to her while her father was asleep, he\nfell so deeply in love again that he lost his head. I do not wish to be\ntoo hard on him, poor creature! and I fancy his right place is in the\nasylum rather than on the scaffold. He used to shout and groan all night\nlong; and the letters he wrote her were so stupid that she used to smile\nas she read them and then put them in her pocket without answering them.\nHere is one of these letters that I found upon her when I undressed her\nafter the horrible deed; a bullet has gone through it, and it is\nstained with blood, but enough may still be read to show that monsieur\nfrequently intended to kill mademoiselle.\"\n\nSo saying, she put down on the table a sheet of paper half burnt\nand half covered with blood, which sent a shudder through the\nspectators--genuine with some of them, mere affectation with many\nothers.\n\nBefore this letter was read, she finished her deposition, and ended it\nwith some assertions which perplexed me considerably; for I could no\nlonger distinguish the boundary between truth and perfidy.\n\n\"Ever since her accident,\" she said, \"mademoiselle has been hovering\nbetween life and death. She will certainly never recover, whatever the\ndoctors may declare. I venture to say that these gentlemen, who only see\nthe patient at certain hours, do not understand her illness as well as\nI, who have never left her for a single night. They pretend that her\nwounds are going on well and that her head is deranged; whereas I say\nthat her wounds are going on badly, and that her head is better than\nthey say. Mademoiselle very rarely talks irrationally, and if by chance\nshe does, it is in the presence of these gentlemen, who confuse and\nfrighten her. She then makes such efforts not to appear mad that she\nactually becomes so; but as soon as they leave her alone with me or\nSaint-Jean or Monsieur l'Abbe, who could quite well have told you how\nthings are, if he had wished, she becomes calm again, and sweet and\nsensible as usual. She says that she could almost die of pain, although\nto the doctors she pretends that she is scarcely suffering at all.\nAnd then she speaks of her murderer with the generosity that becomes a\nChristian; a hundred times a day she will say:\n\n\"'May God pardon him in the next life as I pardon him in this! After\nall, a man must be very fond of a woman to kill her! I was wrong not to\nmarry him; perhaps he would have made me happy. I drove him to despair\nand he has avenged himself on me. Dear Leblanc, take care never to\nbetray the secret I have told you. A single indiscreet word might send\nhim to the scaffold, and that would be the death of my father.'\n\n\"The poor young lady is far from imagining that things have come to this\npass; that I have been summoned by the law and my religion to make known\nwhat I would rather conceal; and that, instead of going out to get an\napparatus for her shower-baths, I have come here to confess the truth.\nThe only thing that consoles me is that it will be easy to hide all this\nfrom M. le Chevalier, who has no more sense now than a babe just born.\nFor myself, I have done my duty; may God be my judge!\"\n\nAfter speaking thus with perfect self-possession and great volubility,\nMademoiselle Leblanc sat down again amid a murmur of approbation, and\nthey proceeded to read the letter which had been found on Edmee.\n\nIt was, indeed, the one I had written to her only a few days before the\nfatal day. They handed it to me; I could not help pressing my lips to\nthe stains of Edmee's blood. Then, after glancing at the writing, I\nreturned the letter, and declared quite calmly that it was written by\nme.\n\nThe reading of this letter was my _coup de grace_. Fate, who seems\ningenious in injuring her victims, had obtained (and perhaps some famous\nhand had contributed to the mutilation) that the passages expressing my\nobedience and respect should be destroyed. Certain poetic touches which\nmight have furnished an explanation of, and an excuse for, my wild\nramblings, were illegible. What showed plain to every eye, and carried\nconviction to every mind, were the lines that remained intact, the lines\nthat bore witness to the violence of my passion and the vehemence of my\nfrenzy. They were such phrases as these: \"Sometimes I feel inclined to\nrise in the middle of the night and go and kill you! I should have done\nthis a hundred times, if I had been sure that I should love you no\nmore after your death. Be considerate; for there are two men in me, and\nsometimes the brigand of old lords it over the new man, etc.\" A smile of\ntriumph played about my enemies' mouths. My supporters were demoralized,\nand even my poor sergeant looked at me in despair. The public had\nalready condemned me.\n\nThis incident afforded the King's advocate a fine chance of thundering\nforth a pompous address, in which he described me as an incurable\nblackguard, as an accursed branch of an accursed stock, as an example of\nthe fatality of evil instincts. Then, after exerting himself to hold\nme up as an object of horror and fear, he endeavoured, in order to give\nhimself an air of impartiality and generosity, to arouse the compassion\nof the judges in my favour; he proceeded to show that I was not\nresponsible for my actions; that my mind had been perverted in early\nchildhood by foul sights and vile principles, and was not sound, nor\never could have been, whatever the origin and growth of my passions. At\nlast, after going through a course of philosophy and rhetoric, to the\ngreat delight of the audience, he demanded that I should be condemned to\nprivation of civil rights and imprisonment for life.\n\nThough my counsel was a man of spirit and intelligence, the letter\nhad so taken him by surprise, the people in court were so unfavourably\ndisposed towards me, and the judges, as they listened to him, so\nfrequently showed signs of incredulity and impatience (an unseemly habit\nwhich appears to be the heritage of the magisterial benches of this\ncountry), that his defence was tame. All that he seemed justified in\ndemanding with any vigour was a further inquiry. He complained that all\nthe formalities had not been fulfilled; that sufficient light had not\nbeen thrown on certain points in the case; that it would be showing\ntoo much haste to give a verdict when several circumstances were still\nwrapped in mystery. He demanded that the doctors should be called to\nexpress an opinion as to the possibility of taking Mademoiselle de\nMauprat's evidence. He pointed out that the most important, in fact the\nonly important, testimony was that of Patience, and that Patience might\nappear any day and prove me innocent. Finally, he demanded that\nthey should order a search to be made for the mendicant friar whose\nresemblance to the Mauprats had not yet been explained, and had been\nsworn to by trustworthy witnesses. In his opinion it was essential\nto discover what had become of Antony Mauprat, and to call upon the\nTrappist for information on this point. He complained bitterly that they\nhad deprived him of all means of defence by refusing any delay; and he\nhad the courage to assert that some evil passions must be responsible\nfor such blind haste as had marked the conduct of this trial. On this\nthe president called him to order. Then the King's advocate replied\ntriumphantly that all formalities had been fulfilled; that the court was\nsufficiently enlightened; that a search for the mendicant friar would\nbe a piece of folly and in bad taste, since John Mauprat had proved his\nlast brother's death, which had taken place several years before. The\ncourt retired to deliberate; at the end of half an hour they came back\nwith a verdict condemning me to death.\n\n\n\n\nXXVI\n\nAlthough the haste with which the trial had been conducted and the\nseverity of the sentence were iniquitous, and filled those who were\nmost bitter against me with amazement, I received the blow with supreme\nindifference; I no longer felt an interest in anything on earth. I\ncommended my soul and the vindication of my memory to God. I said to\nmyself that if Edmee died I should find her again in a better world;\nthat if she survived me and recovered her reason, she would one day\nsucceed in discovering the truth, and that then I should live in\nher heart as a dear and tender memory. Irritable as I am, and always\ninclined to violence in the case of anything that is an obstacle or an\noffence to me, I am astonished at the philosophical resignation and the\nproud calm I have shown on the momentous occasions of life, and above\nall on this one.\n\nIt was two o'clock in the morning. The case had lasted for fourteen\nhours. A silence as of death reigned over the court, which was as full\nand as attentive as at the beginning, so fond are mortals of anything in\nthe nature of a show. That offered by the criminal court at this moment\nwas somewhat dismal. Those men in red robes, as pale and stern and\nimplacable as the Council of Ten at Venice; those ghosts of women decked\nwith flowers, who, by the dim light of the tapers, looked like mere\nreflections of life hovering in the galleries above the priests of\ndeath; the muskets of the guard glittering in the gloom in the back of\nthe court; the heart-broken attitude of my poor sergeant, who had fallen\nat my feet; the silent but vast delight of the Trappist, still standing\nunwearied near the bar; the mournful note of some convent bell in the\nneighbourhood beginning to ring for matins amid the silence of the\nassembly--was not all this enough to touch the nerves of the wives of\nthe farmers-general and to send a thrill through the brawny breasts of\nthe tanners in the body of the court?\n\nSuddenly, just as the court was about to disperse, a figure like that of\nthe traditional peasant of the Danube--squat, rugged, barefooted, with\na long beard, dishevelled hair, a broad, grave brow, and a stern,\ncommanding glance--rose in the midst of the flickering reflections by\nwhich the hall was half lighted, and standing erect before the bar, said\nin a deep, striking voice:\n\n\"I, Jean le Houx, known as Patience, oppose this judgment as iniquitous\nin substance and illegal in form. I demand that it be revised, so that\nI may give my evidence, which is necessary, may be of sovereign\nimportance, and should have been waited for.\"\n\n\"If you had anything to say,\" cried the King's advocate, in a passion,\n\"why did you not present yourself when you were summoned. You are\nimposing on the court by pretending that you have important evidence to\ngive.\"\n\n\"And you,\" answered Patience, more slowly and in an even deeper tone\nthan before, \"you are imposing on the public by pretending that I have\nnot. You know well enough that I must have.\"\n\n\"Remember where you are, witness, and to whom you are speaking.\"\n\n\"I know too well, and I shall not say too much. I hereby declare that I\nhave some important things to say, and that I should have said them at\nthe right time, if you had not done violence to the time. I wish to say\nthem, and I shall; and, believe me, it is better that I should make them\nknown while it is still possible to revise these proceedings. It is even\nbetter for the judges than the prisoner; for the one comes to life again\nin honour, as soon as the others die in infamy.\"\n\n\"Witness,\" said the irritated magistrate, \"the virulence and\nimpertinence of your language will be prejudicial rather than\nadvantageous to the prisoner.\"\n\n\"And who says that I am favourable to the prisoner?\" said Patience in a\nvoice of thunder. \"What do you know about me? What if it pleases me\nto change an illegal and worthless verdict into one which is legal and\nirrevocable?\"\n\n\"But how can you reconcile this desire to see the laws respected,\" said\nthe magistrate, genuinely moved by Patience's powerful personality,\n\"with your own breach of them in not appearing when summoned by the\npublic prosecutor?\"\n\n\"I did not wish to appear.\"\n\n\"Severe penalties may be inflicted on those whose wishes are not in\nharmony with the laws of the land.\"\n\n\"Possibly.\"\n\n\"Have you come here to-day with the intention of submitting to them?\"\n\n\"I have come to see that you respect them.\"\n\n\"I warn you that, if you do not change your tone, I shall have you taken\noff to prison.\"\n\n\"And I warn you that, if you love justice and serve God, you will listen\nto me and suspend the execution of this sentence. It is not for him who\nbrings truth to humble himself before those who should be seeking it.\nBut you who are listening to me now, you men of the people, whom I will\nnot accuse the great of wishing to dupe, you whose voice is called 'the\nvoice of God,' side with me; embrace the cause of truth, that truth\nwhich is in danger of being stifled under false outward shows, or else\nis about to triumph by unfair means. Go down on your knees, you men\nof the people, my brothers, my children; pray, implore, require that\njustice be done and anger repressed. It is your duty, it is your right,\nand to your own interest; for it is you who are insulted and threatened\nwhen laws are violated.\"\n\nPatience spoke with so much warmth, and his sincerity was so strikingly\nmanifest, that a thrill of sympathy ran through the whole audience. At\nthat time, philosophy was too fashionable with the young men of quality\nfor these not to be among the first to respond to an appeal, though\naddressed to others than themselves. They rose with chivalrous\nenthusiasm and turned round to the people, who, carried away by their\nnoble example, rose likewise. There was a wild uproar, and one and all,\nconscious of their dignity and power, cast away personal prejudices in\norder to combine for their common rights. Thus, a noble impetuosity and\na true word are sometimes sufficient to bring back the masses who have\nlong been led astray by sophism.\n\nA respite was granted, and I was led back to my prison amid the applause\nof the people. Marcasse followed me. Patience disappeared without giving\nme a chance to thank him.\n\nThe revision of the sentence could not be made without an order from the\nhigh court. For my own part, before the verdict was given I had resolved\nto make no appeal to this court of cassation of the old jurisprudence.\nBut Patience's bearing and words had had as much effect on my mind as on\nthe minds of the spectators. The spirit of resistance and the sense\nof human dignity, dulled in me and paralyzed, as it were, by grief,\nsuddenly awoke again, and in this hour I realized that man is not made\nfor that selfish concentration of despair which is known as resignation\nor stoicism. No man can cease to have a regard for his own honour\nwithout at the same time ceasing to feel the respect due to the\nprinciple of honour. If it is grand to sacrifice personal glory and life\nto the mysterious decrees of conscience, it is cowardly to abandon both\nto the fury of an unjust persecution. I felt that I had risen in my own\nestimation, and I passed the rest of this momentous night in devising\nmeans of vindicating myself, with as much persistence as I had\npreviously displayed in abandoning myself to fate. With this feeling of\nenergy I could feel hope springing up anew. Edmee, perhaps, was neither\nmad nor mortally wounded. She might acquit me; she might recover.\n\n\"Who knows?\" I said to myself. \"Perhaps she has already done me justice.\nPerhaps it was she who sent Patience to my rescue. Undoubtedly I shall\nbest please her by taking courage again, and not letting myself be\ncrushed by a set of knaves.\"\n\nBut how was I to obtain this order from the high court? It needed a\nspecial mandate from the King; who would procure this? Who would cut\nshort those odious delays which the law can introduce at will into the\nvery cases that it has previously hurried on with blind precipitation?\nWho would prevent my enemies from injuring me and paralyzing all my\nefforts? In a word, who would fight for me? The abbe alone could have\ntaken up my cause; but he was already in prison on my account. His\ngenerous behaviour in the trial had proved that he was still my friend,\nbut his zeal was now fettered. And what could Marcasse do, hampered\nby his humble birth and enigmatical language? Evening came, and I fell\nasleep in the hope that help would be sent from on high; for I had\nprayed to God with my whole soul. A few hours of sleep refreshed me; I\nwas aroused by the noise of bolts being drawn at the other side of\nmy door. O God of goodness! what was my delight on seeing Arthur, my\nbrother in arms, my other self, the man from whom I had had no secret\nfor six long years! I wept like a child on receiving this mark of love\nfrom Providence. Arthur did not believe me guilty! Scientific matters\nconnected with the library at Philadelphia had taken him to Paris, where\nhe had heard of this sad affair in which I was implicated. He had broken\na lance with all who attacked me, and had not lost a moment in coming to\noffer help or consolation.\n\nIn a transport of joy I poured out my soul to him, and then explained\nhow he could assist me. He wanted to take the coach for Paris that very\nevening; but I implored him to go to Sainte-Severe first of all to get\nnews of Edmee. Four mortal days had passed since I had received any;\nand, moreover, Marcasse had never given me such exact details as I could\nhave wished.\n\n\"Ease your mind,\" said Arthur. \"I will undertake to bring you the truth.\nI am a pretty good surgeon; and I have a practised eye. I shall be\nable to give you some idea of what you have to hope or fear. From\nSainte-Severe I shall go straight to Paris.\"\n\nTwo days later I received a long letter from him giving full details\nabout Edmee.\n\nHer condition was extraordinary. She did not speak, nor did she appear\nto be in pain as long as nothing happened to excite her nerves; but on\nthe first word which stirred up recollections of her troubles she would\nbe seized with convulsions. Her moral isolation formed the greatest\nobstacle to recovery. Physically she wanted for nothing; she had two\ngood doctors and a most devoted nurse. Mademoiselle Leblanc likewise was\nvery zealous in her attentions, though this dangerous woman often gave\nher pain by untimely remarks and indiscreet questions. Furthermore,\nArthur assured me that, if ever Edmee had thought me guilty and had\nexpressed an opinion on this point, it must have been in some previous\nphase of her illness; for, during the last fortnight at least, she\nhad been in a state of complete torpor. She would frequently doze, but\nwithout quite falling asleep; she could take liquid food and jellies,\nnor did she ever complain. When her doctors questioned her about her\nsufferings she answered by careless signs and always negatively; and she\nwould never give any indication that she remembered the affections which\nhad filled her life. Her love for her father, however, that feeling\nwhich had always been so deep and powerful in her, was not extinct; she\nwould often shed copious tears; but at such a time she seemed to be deaf\nto all sounds; in vain would they try to make her understand that her\nfather was not dead, as she appeared to believe. With a gesture of\nentreaty she would beg them to stop, not the noise (for that did not\nseem to strike her ear), but the bustle that was going on around her;\nthen, hiding her face in her hands, lying back in her arm-chair and\nbringing her knees up almost to her breast, she would apparently give\nway to inconsolable despair. This silent grief, which could no longer\ncontrol itself and no longer wished to be controlled; this powerful\nwill, which had once been able to quell the most violent storms, and now\ngoing adrift on a dead sea and in an unruffled calm--this, said Arthur,\nwas the most painful spectacle he had ever beheld. Edmee seemed to wish\nto have done with life. Mademoiselle Leblanc, in order to test her and\narouse her, had brutally taken upon herself to announce that her father\nwas dead; she had replied by a sign that she knew. A few hours later\nthe doctors had tried to make her understand that he was alive; she had\nreplied by another sign that she did not believe them. They had wheeled\nthe chevalier's arm-chair into her room; they had brought father and\ndaughter face to face and the two had not recognised each other. Only,\nafter a few moments, Edmee, taking her father for a ghost, had uttered\npiercing cries, and had been seized with convulsions that had opened one\nof her wounds again, and made the doctors tremble for her life. Since\nthen, they had taken care to keep the two apart, and never to breathe a\nword about the chevalier in Edmee's presence. She had taken Arthur for\none of the doctors of the district and had received him with the same\nsweetness and the same indifference as the others. He had not dared\nto speak to her about me; but he extorted me not to despair. There was\nnothing in Edmee's condition that time and rest could not triumph over;\nthere was but little fever left; none of her vital organs were really\naffected; her wounds were almost healed; and it did not seem as if her\nbrain were in such an excited condition that it would be permanently\nderanged. The weak state of her mind, and the prostration of all the\nother organs could not, according to Arthur, long withstand the vitality\nof youth and the recuperative power of an admirable constitution.\nFinally, he advised me to think of myself; I might help towards her\nrecovery, and I might again find happiness in her affection and esteem.\n\nIn a fortnight Arthur returned from Paris with an order from the King\nfor the revision of my sentence. Fresh witnesses were heard. Patience\ndid not appear; but I received a note from him containing these words\nin a shapeless hand, \"You are not guilty, so don't despair.\" The doctors\ndeclared that Mademoiselle de Mauprat might be examined without danger,\nbut that her answers would have no meaning. She was now in better\nhealth. She had recognised her father, and at present would never leave\nhim; but she could understand nothing that was not connected with him.\nShe seemed to derive great pleasure from tending him like a child, and,\non his side, the chevalier would now and then recognise his beloved\ndaughter; but his vital powers were visibly decaying. They questioned\nhim in one of his lucid moments. He replied that his daughter had,\nindeed, fallen from her horse while hunting, and that she had torn her\nbreast on the stump of a tree, but that not a soul had fired at her,\neven by mistake, and that only a madman could possibly believe her\ncousin capable of such a crime. This was all the information they could\ndraw from him. When they asked him what he thought of his nephew's\nabsence, he answered that his nephew was still in the house, and that\nhe saw him every day. Was it that, in his devotion to the good name of\na family--alas! so compromised--he thought to defeat the aims of justice\nby childish lies? This is a point I was never able to ascertain. As for\nEdmee, it was impossible to examine her. At the first question that was\nasked her, she shrugged her shoulders and made a sign that she did not\nwish to be bothered. As the public prosecutor insisted and became\nmore explicit, she stared at him and seemed to be making an effort to\nunderstand. He pronounced my name, she gave a loud cry and fainted. He\nhad to abandon all thoughts of taking her evidence. However, Arthur did\nnot despair. On the contrary, the account of this scene made him think\nthat Edmee's mental faculties might be about to take a favourable turn.\nHe immediately returned to Sainte-Severe, where he remained several days\nwithout writing to me, which caused me great anxiety.\n\nWhen the abbe was questioned again, he persisted in his calm, laconic\nrefusal to give evidence.\n\nMy judges, seeing that the information promised by Patience was not\nforthcoming, hurried on the revision of the trial, and, by another\nexhibition of haste, gave another proof of their animosity. The\nappointed day arrived. I was devoured by anxiety. Arthur had written me\nto keep up my courage, in as laconic a style as Patience. My counsel\nhad been unable to obtain any fresh evidence in my favour. I could see\nclearly that he was beginning to believe me guilty. All he hoped for was\nto obtain a further delay.\n\n\n\n\nXXVII\n\nThere were even more people present than at the first trial. The guard\nwere forced back to the doors of the court, and the crowd occupied every\navailable space, even to the windows of the mansion of Jacques Coeur,\nthe town-hall of the present day. I was much agitated this time,\nthough I had strength and pride enough not to let it be seen. I was now\ninterested in the success of my case, and, as it seemed as if my hopes\nwere not to be realized, I experienced an indescribable feeling of\nuneasiness, a sort of suppressed rage, a bitter hatred of these men who\nwould not open their eyes to my innocence, and even of God who seemed to\nhave deserted me.\n\nIn this state of agitation I had to make such violent efforts to appear\ncalm that I scarcely noticed what was happening around me. I recovered\nsufficient presence of mind when my fresh examination took place to\nanswer in the same terms as at the first trial. Then a black veil seemed\nto fall over my head, an iron ring gripped my brow; the sockets of my\neyes went icily cold; I could see nothing but myself, hear nothing but\nvague, unintelligible sounds. I do not know what actually took place; I\ndo not know if any one announced the apparition which suddenly appeared\nbefore me. I only remember that a door opened behind the judges, and\nthat Arthur came forward leading a veiled woman, that he took off her\nveil after making her sit down in a big arm-chair which the ushers\neagerly wheeled toward her, and that a cry of admiration rang through\nthe hall when Edmee's pale, sublime beauty was revealed.\n\nAt this moment I forgot the crowd, and the judges, and my cause, and the\nwhole universe. I believe that no human power could have withstood my\nwild rush. I dashed like a thunderbolt into the middle of the inclosure\nand, falling at Edmee's feet, I showered kisses on her knees. I have\nbeen told that this act won over the public, and that nearly all the\nladies burst into tears. The young dandies did not venture to laugh; the\njudges were affected; and for a moment truth was completely triumphant.\n\nEdmee looked at me for some time. Her face was as expressionless as the\nface of death. It did not seem as if she could ever recognise me. The\nspectators were waiting in profound silence for her to show some sign of\nhatred or affection for me. All at once she burst into tears, threw her\narms around my neck, and then lost consciousness. Arthur had her carried\nout immediately; he had some trouble in making me return to my place. I\ncould not remember where I was or the issues that were at stake; I clung\nto Edmee's dress, and only wanted to follow her. Arthur addressed the\ncourt and requested that the doctors who had examined Edmee in the\nmorning might again pronounce upon the state of her health. He likewise\ndemanded that she should be recalled to give evidence, and to be\nconfronted with me as soon as she recovered from the attack.\n\n\"This attack is not serious,\" he said. \"Mademoiselle de Mauprat has had\nseveral of the same kind during the last few days and on her way here.\nAfter each her mental faculties have taken a more and more favourable\nturn.\"\n\n\"Go and attend to the invalid,\" said the president. \"She shall be\nrecalled in two hours, if you think she will have recovered from her\nswoon by then. Meanwhile the court will hear the witness on whose demand\nthe first sentence was not carried out.\"\n\nArthur withdrew and Patience was introduced. He was dressed quite\nneatly; but, after saying a few words, he declared that it would be\nimpossible to continue unless they allowed him to take off his coat.\nThis borrowed finery so embarrassed him and seemed so heavy that he\nwas perspiring profusely. No sooner did the president make a sign of\nconsent, accompanied by a smile of scorn, than he threw to the ground\nthis badge of civilization. Then, after carefully pulling down his\nshirt-sleeves over his sinewy arms, he spoke almost as follows:\n\n\"I will speak the truth, the whole truth. I take the oath for the second\ntime; for I have to speak of things that seem contradictory, things that\nI cannot explain to myself. I swear before God and man that I will say\nwhat I know, and as I know it, without being influenced for or against\nany one.\"\n\nHe lifted his big hand and turned round towards the people with a simple\nconfidence, as if to say, \"You can all see that I am taking an oath,\nand you know that I am to be trusted.\" This confidence of his was not\nill-founded. Since the incident in the first trial the public mind had\nbeen much occupied about this extraordinary man, who had spoken before\nthe court with so much daring, and harangued the people in presence\nof the judges. His conduct had filled all the democrats and\n_Philadelphians_ with great curiosity and sympathy. The works of\nBeaumarchais were very fashionable among the upper classes, and this\nwill explain how it was that Patience, though opposed to all the\nauthorities in the province, yet found himself supported and applauded\nby every man who prided himself on his intelligence. They all thought\nthey saw in him Figaro under a new form. The fame of his private virtues\nhad spread; for you remember that during my stay in America, Patience\nhad made himself known among the people of Varenne and had exchanged his\nsorcerer's reputation for that of a public benefactor. They had given\nhim the title of the _great judge_, because he was always ready to\nintervene in disputes, and would always settle to the satisfaction of\nboth sides with admirable good-nature and tact.\n\nThis time he spoke in a high, penetrating voice. It was a rich voice\nof wide compass. His gestures were quiet or animated, according to the\ncircumstances, but always dignified and impressive; the expression on\nhis short, Socratic face was never anything but fine. He had all the\nqualities of an orator; but there was no vanity in his display of them.\nHe spoke in the plain, concise style that he had been obliged to acquire\nin his recent intercourse with men, in discussions about their practical\ninterests.\n\n\"When Mademoiselle de Mauprat was shot,\" he said, \"I was not more than a\ndozen paces from her; but the brushwood at that spot is so thick that I\ncould not see more than two paces in front of me. They had persuaded me\nto take part in the hunt; but it gave me but little pleasure. Finding\nmyself near Gazeau Tower, where I lived for some twenty years, I felt an\ninclination to see my old cell again, and I was bearing down upon it at\na great pace when I heard a shot. That did not frighten me in the least;\nit seemed but natural that there should be some gun fired during a\nbattue. But when I got through the thicket, that is to day, some two\nminutes later, I found Edmee--excuse me, I generally call her by this\nname; I am, so to speak, a sort of foster-father to her--I found Edmee\non her knees upon the ground, wounded as you have been told, and still\nholding the bridle of her horse, which was rearing. She did not know\nwhether she was seriously or slightly wounded, but she had her other\nhand on her breast, and she was saying:\n\n\"'Bernard, this is hideous! I should never have thought that you would\nkill me. Bernard, where are you? Come and see me die. This will kill\nfather!'\n\n\"As she said this she let go the horse's bridle and fell to the ground.\nI rushed towards her.\n\n\"'Ah, you saw it, Patience?' she said. 'Do not speak about it; do not\ntell my father . . .'\n\n\"She threw out her arms, and her body became rigid. I thought that she\nwas dead. She spoke no more until night, after they had extracted the\nbullets from her breast.\"\n\n\"Did you then see Bernard de Mauprat?\"\n\n\"I saw him on the spot where the deed was done, just as Edmee lost\nconsciousness and seemed to be giving up her soul; he seemed to be out\nof his mind. I thought that he was overwhelmed with remorse. I spoke to\nhim sternly, and treated him as a murderer. He made no reply, but sat\ndown on the ground by his cousin's side. He remained there in a dazed\ncondition, even a long time after they had taken her away. No one\nthought of accusing him. The people thought that he had had a fall,\nbecause they saw his horse trotting by the side of the pond; they\nbelieved that his carbine had gone off as he fell. The Abbe Aubert\nwas the only one who heard me accuse M. Bernard of having murdered his\ncousin. During the days that followed, Edmee spoke occasionally, but\nit was not always in my presence; besides, at this time she was nearly\nalways delirious. I maintain that she told nobody (and least of all\nMademoiselle Leblanc) what had passed between herself and M. de Mauprat\nbefore the gun was fired. Nor did she confide this to me any more than\nothers. On the rare occasions when she was in possession of her senses\nshe would say in answer to our questions, that Bernard had certainly not\ndone it on purpose, and several times during the first three days\nshe even asked to see him. However, when she was delirious she would\nsometimes cry, 'Bernard! Bernard! You have committed a great crime. You\nhave killed my father!'\n\n\"That was her idea; she used really to think that her father was dead;\nand she thought so for a long time. Very little, therefore, of what she\nsaid is to be taken seriously. The words that Mademoiselle Leblanc\nhas put into her mouth are false. After three days she ceased to talk\nintelligibly, and at the end of a week she ceased to speak altogether.\nWhen she recovered her reason, about a week ago, she sent away\nMademoiselle Leblanc, which would clearly show that she had some\nground for disliking her maid. That is what I have to say against M. de\nMauprat. It rested entirely with myself to keep silent; but having other\nthings to say yet, I wished to make known the whole truth.\"\n\nPatience paused awhile; the public and the judges themselves, who were\nbeginning to take an interest in me and lose the bitterness of their\nprejudices, were apparently thunderstruck at hearing evidence so\ndifferent from what they expected.\n\nPatience continued as follows:\n\n\"For several weeks I remained convinced of Bernard's guilt. But I was\npondering over the matter the while; I frequently said to myself that\na man as good and clever as Bernard, a man for whom Edmee felt so much\nesteem, and whom M. le Chevalier loved like a son, a man, in short, so\ndeeply imbued with the spirit of justice and truth, could not between\none day and the next turn into a scoundrel. Then the idea came into my\nhead that, after all, it might have been some other Mauprat who fired\nthe shot. I do not speak of the one who has become a Trappist,\" he\nadded, looking among the audience for Jean de Mauprat, who, however\nwas not there; \"I speak of the man whose death has never been proved,\nalthough the court thought fit to overlook this, and to accept M. Jean\nde Mauprat's word.\"\n\n\"Witness,\" said the president, \"I must remind you that you are not here\nto serve as counsel for the prisoner, or to criticise the decisions of\nthis court. You must confine yourself to a statement of facts, and not\nexpress your opinion on the question at issue.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" replied Patience. \"I must, however, explain why I did not\nwish to appear at the first trial, seeing that the only evidence I\nhad was against M. Bernard, and that I could not trust that evidence\nmyself.\"\n\n\"You are not asked to explain this at present. Please keep to your\nevidence.\"\n\n\"One moment. I have my honour to defend; I have to explain my own\nconduct, if you please.\"\n\n\"You are not the prisoner; you are not here to plead your own cause. If\nthe court thinks right to prosecute you for contempt you can see to your\nown defence; but there is no question of that now.\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon. The question is for me to let the court see whether\nI am an honest man or a false witness. It would seem that this has\nsomething to do with the case; the prisoner's life depends on it; the\ncourt cannot consider that a matter of indifference.\"\n\n\"Proceed,\" said the King's advocate, \"and try to remember the respect\nyou owe to the court.\"\n\n\"I have no wish to offend the court,\" replied Patience. \"I would merely\nobserve that a man may refuse to submit to the orders of the court from\nconscientious motives which the court can legally condemn, but which\neach judge, personally, can understand and excuse. I say, then, that I\ncould not persuade myself of Bernard de Mauprat's guilt; my ears alone\nknew of it; this was not enough for me. Pardon me, gentlemen, I, too, am\na judge. Make inquiries about me; in my village they call me 'the great\njudge.' When my fellow-villagers ask me to decide some tavern dispute or\nthe boundary of some field, I do not so much listen to their opinions\nas my own. In judging a man one must take account of more than a single\nlittle act. Many previous ones will help to show the truth or falsity\nof the last that is imputed to him. Thus, being unable to believe that\nBernard was a murderer, and having heard more than a dozen people, whom\nI consider incapable of giving false evidence, testify to the fact that\na monk 'bearing a resemblance to the Mauprats' had been prowling about\nthe country, and having myself seen this monk's back and habit as he\nwas passing through Pouligny on the morning of the event, I wished to\ndiscover if he was in Varenne; and I learnt that he was still there;\nthat is to say, after leaving it, he had returned about the time of the\ntrial last month. And, what is more, I learnt that he was acquainted\nwith John Mauprat. Who can this monk be? I asked myself; why does the\nvery sight of him frighten all the people in the country? What is he\ndoing in Varenne? If he belongs to the Carmelite convent, why does he\nnot wear their habit? If he is of the same order as John, why is he\nnot staying with him at the Carmelites? If he is collecting money, why,\nafter making a collection in one place, does he not move on to another,\ninstead of returning and bothering people who have given him money only\nthe day before? If he is a Trappist and does not want to stay with the\nCarmelites like the other, why does he not go back to his own convent?\nWhat is this wandering monk? And how does John Mauprat, who has told\nseveral people that he does not know him, know him so well that they\nlunch together from time to time in a tavern at Crevant? I made up my\nmind, then, to give evidence, though it might, in a measure, do harm\nto M. Bernard, so as to be able to say what I am now saying, even if it\nshould be of no use. But as you never allow witnesses sufficient time\nto try to verify what they have reason to believe, I started off\nimmediately for my woods, where I live like the foxes, with a\ndetermination not to quit them until I had discovered what this monk was\ndoing in the country. So I put myself on his track and I have discovered\nwho he is; he is the murderer of Edmee de Mauprat; his name is Antony\nMauprat.\"\n\nThis revelation caused a great stir on the bench and among the public.\nEvery one looked around for John Mauprat, whose face was nowhere to be\nseen.\n\n\"What proof have you of this?\" said the president.\n\n\"I am about to tell you,\" replied Patience. \"Having learnt from\nthe landlady at Crevant, to whom I have occasionally been of some\nassistance, that the two Trappists used to lunch at her tavern from time\nto time, as I have said, I went and took up my abode about half a league\nfrom here, in a hermitage known as Le Trou aux Fades, situated in the\nmiddle of the woods and open to the first comer, furniture and all. It\nis a cave in the rock, containing a seat in the shape of a big stone and\nnothing else. I lived there for a couple of days on roots and bits of\nbread that they occasionally brought me from the tavern. It is against\nmy principles to live in a tavern. On the third day the landlady's\nlittle boy came and informed me that the two monks were about to sit\ndown to a meal. I hastened back, and hid myself in a cellar which\nopens into the garden. The door of this cellar is quite close to the\napple-tree under which these gentlemen were taking luncheon in the open\nair. John was sober; the other was eating like a Carmelite and drinking\nlike a Franciscan. I could hear and see everything at my ease.\n\n\"'There must be an end of this,' Antony was saying--I easily recognised\nthe man when I saw him drink and heard him swear--'I am tired of playing\nthis game for you. Hide me away with the Carmelites or I shall make a\nrow.'\n\n\"'And what row can you make that will not bring you to the gallows, you\nclumsy fool!' answered John. 'It is very certain that you will not set\nfoot inside the monastery. I don't want to find myself mixed up in a\ncriminal trial; for they would discover what you are in an hour or two.'\n\n\"'And why, I should like to know? You make them all believe that you\nare a saint!'\n\n\"'Because I know how to behave like a saint; whereas you--you behave\nlike a fool. Why, you can't stop swearing for an hour, and you would be\nbreaking all the mugs after dinner!'\n\n\"'I say, Nepomucene,' rejoined the other, 'do you fancy that you would\nget off scot-free if I were caught and tried?'\n\n\"'Why not?' answered the Trappist. 'I had no hand in your folly, nor\ndid I advise anything of this kind.'\n\n\"'Ha! ha! my fine apostle!' cried Antony, throwing himself back in his\nchair in a fit of laughter. 'You are glad enough about it, now that it\nis done. You were always a coward; and had it not been for me you would\nnever have thought of anything better than getting yourself made a\nTrappist, to ape devotion and afterward get absolution for the past,\nso as to have a right to draw a little money from the \"Headbreakers\"\nof Sainte-Severe. By Jove! a mighty fine ambition, to give up the ghost\nunder a monk's cowl after leading a pretty poor life and only tasting\nhalf its sweets, let alone hiding like a mole! Come, now; when they have\nhung my pretty Bernard, and the lovely Edmonde is dead, and when the\nold neck-breaker has given back his big bones to the earth; when we have\ninherited all that pretty fortune yonder; you will own that we have done\na capital stroke of business--three at a blow! It would cost me rather\ntoo much to play the saint, seeing that convent ways are not quite my\nways, and that I don't know how to wear the habit; so I shall throw\nthe cowl to the winds, and content myself with building a chapel at\nRoche-Mauprat and taking the sacrament four times a year.'\n\n\"'Everything you have done in this matter is stupid and infamous.'\n\n\"'Bless my soul! Don't talk of infamy, my sweet brother, or I shall\nmake you swallow this bottle whole.'\n\n\"'I say that it is a piece of folly, and if it succeeds you ought to\nburn a fine candle to the Virgin. If it does not succeed, I wash my\nhands of the whole business, do you hear? After I had been in hiding in\nthe secret passage in the keep, and had heard Bernard telling his\nvalet after supper that he was going out of his mind on account of the\nbeautiful Edmee, I happened to throw out a suggestion that there might\nbe a chance here of doing a good stroke of business; and like a fool you\ntook the matter seriously, and, without consulting me or waiting for a\nfavourable moment, you went and did a deed that should have been thought\nover and properly planned.'\n\n\"'A favourable moment, chicken-heart that you are! How the deuce was\nI to get one? \"Opportunity makes the thief.\" I find myself surprised\nby the hunt in the middle of the forest; I go and hide in that cursed\nGazeau Tower; I see my turtle-doves coming; I overhear a conversation\nthat might make one die of laughing, and see Bernard blubbering and the\ngirl playing the haughty beauty; Bernard goes off like an idiot without\nshowing himself a man; I find on me--God knows how--a rascally pistol\nalready loaded. Bang! . . .'\n\n\"'Hold your tongue, you wild brute!' said the other, quite frightened.\n'Do you think a tavern is the proper place to talk of these things?\nKeep that tongue quiet, you wretched creature, or I will never see you\nagain.'\n\n\"'And yet you will have to see me, sweet brother mine, when I go and\nring the bell at the gate of the Carmelite monastery.'\n\n\"'If you come I will denounce you.'\n\n\"'You will not denounce me, for I know too much about you.'\n\n\"'I am not afraid. I have given proofs of my repentance; I have\nexpiated my sins.'\n\n\"'Hypocrite!'\n\n\"'Come, now, hold your tongue, you madman!' said the other. 'I must\nleave you. There is some money.'\n\n\"'That all?'\n\n\"'What do you expect from a monk? Do you imagine that I am rich?'\n\n\"'Your Carmelites are; and you can do what you like with them.'\n\n\"'I might give you more, but I would rather not. As soon as you got a\ncouple of louis you would be off for a debauch, and make enough row to\nbetray yourself.'\n\n\"'And if you want me to quit this part of the country for some time,\nwhat do you suppose I am to travel with?'\n\n\"'Three times already I have given you enough to take you away, haven't\nI? And each time you have come back, after drinking it all in the\nfirst place of ill-fame on the frontier of the province! Your impudence\nsickens me, after the evidence given against you, when the police are\non the watch, when Bernard is appealing for a fresh trial. You may be\ncaught at any moment!'\n\n\"'That is for you to see to, brother. You can lead the Carmelites by\nthe nose; and the Carmelites can lead the bishop, through some little\npeccadillo, I suppose, done together on the quiet in the convent after\nsupper . . .'\"\n\nHere the president interrupted Patience.\n\n\"Witness,\" he said, \"I call you to order. You are outraging a prelate's\nvirtue by daring to retail such a conversation.\"\n\n\"By no means,\" replied Patience. \"I am merely reporting a drunkard's and\na murderer's invectives against the prelate. They do not concern me in\nthe least; and every one here knows what value to put upon them; but,\nif you wish, I will say no more on this point. The discussion lasted\nfor some time longer. The real Trappist wanted to make the sham Trappist\nleave the country, and the latter persisted in remaining, declaring\nthat, if he were not on the spot, his brother would have him arrested\nimmediately after Bernard's head had been cut off, so that he might have\nthe whole inheritance to himself. John, driven to extremities, seriously\nthreatened to denounce him and hand him over to justice.\n\n\"'Enough!' replied Antony. 'You will take good care not to do that, I\nknow; for, if Bernard is acquitted, good-bye to the inheritance!'\n\n\"Then they separated. The real Trappist went away looking very\nanxious; the other fell asleep, with his elbows on the table. I left\nmy hiding-place to take steps for his arrest. It was just then that the\npolice, who had been on my track for some time to force me to come and\ngive evidence, collared me. In vain did I point to the monk as Edmee's\nmurderer; they would not believe me, and said they had no warrant\nagainst him. I wanted to arouse the village, but they prevented me from\nspeaking. They brought me here, from station to station, as if I had\nbeen a deserter, and for the last week I have been in the cells and no\none has deigned to heed my protests. They would not even let me see M.\nBernard's lawyer, or inform him that I was in prison; it was only just\nnow that the jailer came, and told me that I must put on my coat and\nappear in court. I do not know whether all this is according to the\nlaw; but one thing is certain, namely, that the murderer might have been\narrested and has not been; nor will he be, unless you secure the\nperson of John Mauprat to prevent him from warning, I do not say his\naccomplice, but his _protege_. I state on oath that, from all I have\nheard, John Mauprat is above any suspicion of complicity. As to the act\nof allowing an innocent man to be handed over to the rigour of the law,\nand of endeavouring to save a guilty man by going so far as to give\nfalse evidence, and produce false documents to prove his death . . .\"\n\nPatience, noticing that the president was again about to interrupt him,\nhastened to end his testimony by saying:\n\n\"As to that, gentlemen, it is for you, not for me, to judge him.\"\n\n\n\n\nXXVIII\n\nAfter this important evidence the trial was suspended for a few minutes.\nWhen the judges returned Edmee was brought back into the court. Pale and\nweak, scarcely able to drag herself to the arm-chair which was reserved\nfor her, she nevertheless displayed considerable mental vigour and\npresence of mind.\n\n\"Do you think you can answer the questions which will be put to you\nwithout unduly exciting yourself?\" asked the president.\n\n\"I hope so, sir,\" she replied. \"It is true that I have recently been\nseriously ill, and that it is only within the last few days that I have\nrecovered my memory; but I believe I have completely recovered it, and\nmy mind feels quite clear.\"\n\n\"Your name?\"\n\n\"Solange-Edmonde de Mauprat; _Edmea sylvestris_,\" she added in an\nundertone.\n\nI shuddered. As she said these unseasonable words her eyes had assumed\na strange expression. I feared that her mind was going to wander still\nfurther. My counsel was also alarmed and looked at me inquiringly. No\none but myself had understood these two words which Edmee had been in\nthe habit of frequently repeating during the first and last days of\nher illness. Happily this was the last sign of any disturbance in\nher faculties. She shook her beautiful head, as if to drive out\nany troublesome ideas; and, the president having asked her for an\nexplanation of these unintelligible words, she replied with sweetness\nand dignity:\n\n\"It is nothing, sir. Please continue my examination.\"\n\n\"Your age, mademoiselle?\"\n\n\"Twenty-four.\"\n\n\"Are you related to the prisoner?\"\n\n\"He is my second cousin, and my father's grand-nephew.\"\n\n\"Do you swear to speak the truth, the whole truth?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"Raise your hand.\"\n\nEdmee turned towards Arthur with a sad smile. He took off her glove, and\nhelped to raise her arm, which hung nerveless and powerless by her side.\nI felt big tears rolling down my cheeks.\n\nWith delicacy and simplicity Edmee related how she and I had lost our\nway in the woods; how I, under the impression that her horse had bolted,\nhad unseated her in my eager anxiety to stop the animal; how a slight\naltercation had ensued, after which, with a little feminine temper,\nfoolish enough, she had wished to mount her mare again without help; how\nshe had even spoken unkindly to me, not meaning a word of what she said,\nfor she loved me like a brother; how, deeply hurt by her harshness, I\nhad moved away a few yards to obey her; and how, just as she was about\nto follow me, grieved herself at our childish quarrel, she had felt a\nviolent shock in her breast, and had fallen almost without hearing any\nreport. It was impossible for her to say in which direction she was\nlooking, or from which side the shot had come.\n\n\"That is all that happened,\" she added. \"Of all people I am least\nable to explain this occurrence. In my soul and conscience I can only\nattribute it to the carelessness of one of the hunting party, who is\nafraid to confess. Laws are so severe. And it is so difficult to prove\nthe truth.\"\n\n\"So, mademoiselle, you do not think that your cousin was the author of\nthis attempt?\"\n\n\"No, sir, certainly not! I am no longer delirious, and I should not have\nlet myself be brought before you if I had felt that my mind was at all\nweak.\"\n\n\"Apparently, then, you consider that a state of mental aberration was\nresponsible for the revelations you made to Patience, to Mademoiselle\nLeblanc, your companion, and also, perhaps, to Abbe Aubert.\"\n\n\"I made no revelations,\" she replied emphatically, \"either to the worthy\nPatience, the venerable abbe, or my servant Leblanc. If the meaningless\nwords we utter in a state of delirium are to be called 'revelations,'\nall the people who frighten us in our dreams would have to be condemned\nto death. How could I have revealed facts of which I never had any\nknowledge?\"\n\n\"But at the time you received the wound, and fell from your horse, you\nsaid: 'Bernard, Bernard! I should never have thought that you would kill\nme!'\"\n\n\"I do not remember having said so; and, even if I did, I cannot conceive\nthat any one would attach much importance to the impressions of a\nperson who had suddenly been struck to the ground, and whose mind was\nannihilated, as it were. All that I know is that Bernard de Mauprat\nwould lay down his life for my father or myself; which does not make it\nvery probable that he wanted to murder me. Great God! what would be his\nobject?\"\n\nIn order to embarrass Edmee, the president now utilized all the\narguments which could be drawn from Mademoiselle Leblanc's evidence. As\na fact, they were calculated to cause her not a little confusion.\nEdmee, who was at first somewhat astonished to find that the law was in\npossession of so many details which she believed were unknown to others,\nregained her courage and pride, however, when they suggested, in those\nbrutally chaste terms which are used by the law in such a case, that she\nhad been a victim of my violence at Roche-Mauprat. Her spirit thoroughly\nroused, she proceeded to defend my character and her own honour, and\ndeclared that, considering how I had been brought up, I had behaved\nmuch more honourably than might have been expected. But she still had\nto explain all her life from this point onward, the breaking off of her\nengagement with M. de la Marche, her frequent quarrels with myself, my\nsudden departure for America, her refusal of all offers of marriage.\n\n\"All these questions are abominable,\" she said, rising suddenly, her\nphysical strength having returned with the exercise of her mental\npowers. \"You ask me to give an account of my inmost feelings; you would\nsound the mysteries of my soul; you put my modesty on the rack; you\nwould take to yourself rights that belong only to God. I declare to you\nthat, if my own life were now at stake and not another's, you should not\nextract a word more from me. However, to save the life of the meanest of\nmen I would overcome my repugnance; much more, therefore, will I do for\nhim who is now at the bar. Know then--since you force me to a confession\nwhich is painful to the pride and reserve of my sex--that everything\nwhich to you seems inexplicable in my conduct, everything which you\nattribute to Bernard's persecutions and my own resentment, to his\nthreats and my terror, finds its justification in one word: I love him!\"\n\nOn uttering this word, the red blood in her cheeks, and in the ringing\ntone of the proudest and most passionate soul that ever existed, Edmee\nsat down again and buried her face in her hands. At this moment I was so\ntransported that I could not help crying out:\n\n\"Let them take me to the scaffold now; I am king of all the earth!\"\n\n\"To the scaffold! You!\" said Edmee, rising again. \"Let them rather take\nme. Is it your fault, poor boy, if for seven years I have hidden from\nyou the secret of my affections; if I did not wish you to know it until\nyou were the first of men in wisdom and intelligence as you are already\nthe first in greatness of heart? You are paying dearly for my ambition,\nsince it has been interpreted as scorn and hatred. You have good reason\nto hate me, since my pride has brought you to the felon's dock. But I\nwill wash away your shame by a signal reparation; though they send you\nto the scaffold, you shall go there with the title of my husband.\"\n\n\"Your generosity is carrying you too far, Edmee de Mauprat,\" said the\npresident. \"It would seem that, in order to save your relative, you are\naccusing yourself of coquetry and unkindness; for, how otherwise do\nyou explain the fact that you exasperated this young man's passion by\nrefusing him for seven years?\"\n\n\"Perhaps, sir,\" replied Edmee archly, \"the court is not competent to\njudge this matter. Many women think it no great crime to show a little\ncoquetry with the man they love. Perhaps we have a right to this when\nwe have sacrificed all other men to him. After all, it is a very natural\nand very innocent ambition to make the man of one's choice feel that\none is a soul of some price, that one is worth wooing, and worth a long\neffort. True, if this coquetry resulted in the condemnation of one's\nlover to death, one would speedily correct one's self of it. But,\nnaturally, gentlemen, you would not think of atoning for my cruelty by\noffering the poor young man such a consolation as this.\"\n\nAfter saying these words in an animated, ironical tone, Edmee burst\ninto tears. This nervous sensibility which brought to the front all the\nqualities of her soul and mind, tenderness, courage, delicacy, pride,\nmodesty, gave her face at the same time an expression so varied, so\nwinning in all its moods, that the grave, sombre assembly of judges let\nfall the brazen cuirass of impassive integrity and the leaden cope of\nhypocritical virtue. If Edmee had not triumphantly defended me by her\nconfession, she had at least roused the greatest interest in my favour.\nA man who is loved by a beautiful woman carries with him a talisman that\nmakes him invulnerable; all feel that his life is of greater value than\nother lives.\n\nEdmee still had to submit to many questions; she set in their proper\nlight the facts which had been misrepresented by Mademoiselle Leblanc.\nTrue, she spared me considerably; but with admirable skill she managed\nto elude certain questions, and so escaped the necessity of either lying\nor condemning me. She generously took upon herself the blame for all\nmy offences, and pretended that, if we had had various quarrels, it\nwas because she herself took a secret pleasure in them; because they\nrevealed the depth of my love; that she had let me go to America to put\nmy virtue to the proof, thinking that the campaign would not last more\nthan a year, as was then supposed; that afterwards she had considered me\nin honour bound to submit to the indefinite prolongation, but that\nshe had suffered more than myself from my absence; finally, she quite\nremembered the letter which had been found upon her, and, taking it up,\nshe gave the mutilated passages with astonishing accuracy, and at the\nsame time called the clerk to follow as she deciphered the words which\nwere half obliterated.\n\n\"This letter was so far from being a threatening letter,\" she said, \"and\nthe impression it left on me was so far from filling me with fear or\naversion, that it was found on my heart, where I had been carrying it\nfor a week, though I had not even let Bernard know that I had received\nit.\"\n\n\"But you have not yet explained,\" said the president, \"how it was that\nseven years ago, when your cousin first came to live in your house,\nyou armed yourself with a knife which you used to put under your pillow\nevery night, after having it sharpened as if to defend yourself in case\nof need.\"\n\n\"In my family,\" she answered with a blush, \"we have a somewhat romantic\ntemperament and a very proud spirit. It is true that I frequently\nthought of killing myself, because I felt an unconquerable affection\nfor my cousin springing up in me. Believing myself bound by indissoluble\nties to M. de la Marche. I would have died rather than break my word, or\nmarry any other than Bernard. Subsequently M. de la Marche freed me from\nmy promise with much delicacy and loyalty, and I no longer thought of\ndying.\"\n\nEdmee now withdrew, followed by all eyes and by a murmur of approbation.\nNo sooner had she passed out of the hall than she fainted again; but\nthis attack was without any grave consequences, and left no traces after\na few days.\n\nI was so bewildered, so intoxicated by what she had just said, that\nhenceforth I could scarcely see what was taking place around me. Wholly\nwrapped up in thoughts of my love, I nevertheless could not cast aside\nall doubts; for, if Edmee had been silent about some of my actions, it\nwas also possible that she had exaggerated her affection for me in the\nhope of extenuating my faults. I could not bring myself to think that\nshe had loved me before my departure for America, and, above all, from\nthe very beginning of my stay at Sainte-Severe. This was the one thought\nthat filled my mind; I did not even remember anything further about the\ncase or the object of my trial. It seemed to me that the sole question\nat issue in this chill Areopagus was this: Is he loved, or is he not?\nFor me, victory or defeat, life or death, hung on that, and that alone.\n\nI was roused from these reveries by the voice of Abbe Aubert. He was\nthin and wasted, but seemed perfectly calm; he had been kept in solitary\nconfinement and had suffered all the hardships of prison life with the\nresignation of a martyr. In spite, however, of all precautions, the\nclever Marcasse, who could work his way anywhere like a ferret, had\nmanaged to convey to him a letter from Arthur, to which Edmee had added\na few words. Authorized by this letter to say everything, he made a\nstatement similar to that made by Patience, and owned that Edmee's first\nwords after the occurrence had made him believe me guilty; but that\nsubsequently, seeing the patient's mental condition, and remembering my\nirreproachable behaviour for more than six years, and obtaining a little\nnew light from the preceding trial and the public rumours about the\npossible existence of Antony Mauprat, he had felt too convinced of my\ninnocence to be willing to give evidence which might injure me. If\nhe gave his evidence now, it was because he thought that further\ninvestigations might have enlightened the court, and that his words\nwould not have the serious consequences they might have had a month\nbefore.\n\nQuestioned as to Edmee's feelings for me, he completely destroyed all\nMademoiselle Leblanc's inventions, and declared that not only did Edmee\nlove me ardently, but that she had felt an affection for me from the\nvery first day we met. This he affirmed on oath, though emphasizing my\npast misdeeds somewhat more than Edmee had done. He owned that at first\nhe had frequently feared that my cousin would be foolish enough to marry\nme, but that he had never had any fear for her life, since he had always\nseen her reduce me to submission by a single word or a mere look, even\nin my most boorish days.\n\nThe continuation of the trial was postponed to await the results of the\nwarrants issued for the arrest of the assassin. People compared my trial\nto that of Calas, and the comparison had no sooner become a general\ntopic of conversation than my judges, finding themselves exposed to a\nthousand shafts, realized very vividly that hatred and prejudice are bad\ncounsellors and dangerous guides. The sheriff of the province declared\nhimself the champion of my cause and Edmee's knight, and he himself\nescorted her back to her father. He set all the police agog. They acted\nwith vigour and arrested John Mauprat. When he found himself a prisoner\nand threatened, he betrayed his brother, and declared that they might\nfind him any night at Roche-Mauprat, hiding in a secret chamber which\nthe tenant's wife helped him to reach, without her husband's knowledge.\n\nThey took the Trappist to Roche-Mauprat under a good escort, so that he\nmight show them this secret chamber, which, in spite of his genius\nfor exploring walls and timber-work, the old pole-cat hunter and\nmole-catcher Marcasse had never managed to reach. They took me there,\nlikewise, so that I might help to find this room or passage leading\nto it, in case the Trappist should repent of his present sincere\nintentions. Once again, then, I revisited this abhorred manor with the\nancient chief of the brigands transformed into a Trappist. He showed\nhimself so humble and cringing in my presence, he made so light of his\nbrother's life, and expressed such abject submission that I was filled\nwith disgust, and after a few moments begged him not to speak to me any\nmore. Keeping in touch with the mounted police outside, we began our\nsearch for the secret chamber. At first John had pretended that he\nknew of its existence, without knowing its exact location now that\nthree-quarters of the keep had been destroyed. When he saw me, however,\nhe remembered that I had surprised him in my room, and that he had\ndisappeared through the wall. He resigned himself, therefore, to taking\nus to it, and showing us the secret; this was very curious; but I will\nnot amuse myself by giving you an account of it. The secret chamber was\nopened; no one was there. Yet the expedition had been made with despatch\nand secrecy. It did not appear probable that John had had time to warn\nhis brother. The keep was surrounded by the police and all the doors\nwere well guarded. The night was dark, and our invasion had filled all\nthe inmates of the farm with terror. The tenant had no idea what we were\nlooking for, but his wife's agitation and anxiety seemed a sure sign\nthat Antony was still in the keep. She had not sufficient presence of\nmind to assume a reassured air after we had explored the first room, and\nthat made Marcasse think that there must be a second. Did the Trappist\nknow of this, and was he pretending ignorance? He played his part so\nwell that we were all deceived. We set to work to explore all the nooks\nand corners of the ruins again. There was one large tower standing apart\nfrom the other buildings; it did not seem as if this could offer any\none a refuge. The staircase had completely fallen in at the time of the\nfire, and there could not be found a ladder long enough to reach the\ntop story; even the farmer's ladders tied together with ropes were too\nshort. This top story seemed to be in a state of good preservation and\nto contain a room lighted by two loopholes. Marcasse, after examining\nthe thickness of the wall, affirmed that there might be a staircase\ninside, such as might be found in many an old tower. But where was the\nexit? Perhaps it was connected with some subterranean passage. Would the\nassassin dare to issue from his retreat as long as we were there? If, in\nspite of the darkness of the night and the silence of our proceedings,\nhe had got wind of our presence, would he venture into the open as long\nas we continued on the watch at all points?\n\n\"That is not probable,\" said Marcasse. \"We must devise some speedy means\nof getting up there; and I see one.\"\n\nHe pointed to a beam at a frightful height, all blackened by the fire,\nand running from the tower over a space of some twenty feet to the\ngarrets of the nearest building. At the end of this beam there was\na large gap in the wall of the tower caused by the falling-in of the\nadjoining parts. In his explorations, indeed, Marcasse had fancied that\nhe could see the steps of a narrow staircase through this gap. The wall,\nmoreover, was quite thick enough to contain one. The mole-catcher had\nnever cared to risk his life on this beam; not that he was afraid of\nits narrowness or its height; he was accustomed to these perilous\n\"crossings,\" as he called them; but the beam had been partly consumed\nby the fire and was so thin in the middle that it was impossible to say\nwhether it would bear the weight of a man, even were he as slender\nand diaphanous as the worthy sergeant. Up to the present nothing had\nhappened here of sufficient importance for him to risk his life in\nthe experiment. Now, however, the case was different. Marcasse did not\nhesitate. I was not near him when he formed his plan; I should have\ndissuaded him from it at all costs. I was not aware of it until he had\nalready reached the middle of the beam, the spot where the burnt wood\nwas perhaps nothing more than charcoal. How shall I describe to you\nwhat I felt when I beheld my faithful friend in mid-air, gravely walking\ntoward his goal? Blaireau was trotting in front of him as calmly as in\nthe old days when it was a question of hunting through bundles of hay in\nsearch of stoats and dormice. Day was breaking, and the hildalgo's slim\noutline and his modest yet stately bearing could be clearly seen against\nthe gray sky. I put my hands to my face; I seemed to hear the fatal beam\ncracking; I stifled a cry of terror lest I should unnerve him at this\nsolemn and critical moment. But I could not suppress this cry, or help\nraising my head when I heard two shots fired from the tower. Marcasse's\nhat fell at the first shot; the second grazed his shoulder. He stopped a\nmoment.\n\n\"Not touched!\" he shouted at us.\n\nAnd making a rush he was quickly across the aerial bridge. He got into\nthe tower through the gap and darted up the stairs, crying:\n\n\"Follow me, my lads! The beam will bear.\"\n\nImmediately five other bold and active men who had accompanied him got\nastride upon the beam, and with the help of their hands reached the\nother end one by one. When the first of them arrived in the garret\nwhither Antony Mauprat had fled, he found him grappling with Marcasse,\nwho, quite carried away by his triumph and forgetting that it was not a\nquestion of killing an enemy but of capturing him, set about lunging\nat him with his long rapier as if he had been a weasel. But the sham\nTrappist was a formidable enemy. He had snatched the sword from the\nsergeant's hands, hurled him to the ground, and would have strangled\nhim had not a gendarme thrown himself on him from behind. With his\nprodigious strength he held his own against the first three assailants;\nbut, with the help of the other two, they succeeded in overcoming him.\nWhen he saw that he was caught he made no further resistance and let his\nhands be bound together. They brought him down the stairs, which were\nfound to lead to the bottom of a dry well in the middle of the tower.\nAntony was in the habit of leaving and entering by means of a ladder\nwhich the farmer's wife held for him and immediately afterwards\nwithdrew. In a transport of delight I threw myself into my sergeant's\narms.\n\n\"A mere trifle,\" he said; \"enjoyed it. I found that my foot was still\nsure and my head cool. Ha! ha! old sergeant,\" he added, looking at his\nleg, \"old hidalgo, old mole-catcher, after this they won't make so many\njokes about your calves!\"\n\n\n\n\nXXIX\n\nIf Anthony Mauprat had been a man of mettle he might have done me a\nbad turn by declaring that he had been a witness of my attempt to\nassassinate Edmee. As he had reasons for hiding himself before this last\ncrime, he could have explained why he had kept out of sight, and why he\nhad been silent about the occurrences at Gazeau Tower. I had nothing in\nmy favour except Patience's evidence. Would this have been sufficient\nto procure my acquittal? The evidence of so many others was against\nme, even that given by my friends, and by Edmee, who could not deny my\nviolent temper and the possibility of such a crime.\n\nBut Antony, in words the most insolent of all the \"Hamstringers,\" was\nthe most cowardly in deeds. He no sooner found himself in the hands\nof justice than he confessed everything, even before knowing that his\nbrother had thrown him over.\n\nAt his trial there were some scandalous scenes, in which the two\nbrothers accused each other in a loathsome way. The Trappist, whose rage\nwas kept in check by his hypocrisy, coldly abandoned the ruffian to his\nfate, and denied that he had ever advised him to commit the crime. The\nother, driven to desperation, accused him of the most horrible deeds,\nincluding the poisoning of my mother, and Edmee's mother, who had both\ndied of violent inflammation of the intestines within a short time of\neach other. John Mauprat, he declared, used to be very skilful in the\nart of preparing poisons and would introduce himself into houses under\nvarious disguises to mix them with the food. He affirmed that, on\nthe day that Edmee had been brought to Roche-Mauprat, John had called\ntogether all his brothers to discuss plans for making away with this\nheiress to a considerable fortune, a fortune which he had striven\nto obtain by crime, since he had tried to destroy the effects of the\nChevalier Hubert's marriage. My mother's life, too, had been the\nprice paid for the latter's wish to adopt his brother's child. All\nthe Mauprats had been in favour of making away with Edmee and myself\nsimultaneously, and John was actually preparing the poison when the\npolice happened to turn aside their hideous designs by attacking the\ncastle. John denied the charges with pretended horror, saying humbly\nthat he had committed quite enough mortal sins of debauchery and\nirreligion without having these added to his list. As it was difficult\nto take Antony's word for them without further investigation; as this\ninvestigation was almost impossible, and as the clergy were too powerful\nand too much interested in preventing a scandal to allow it, John\nMauprat was acquitted on the charge of complicity and merely sent back\nto the Trappist monastery; the archbishop forbade him ever to set foot\nin the diocese again, and, moreover, sent a request to his superiors\nthat they would never allow him to leave the convent. He died there a\nfew years later in all the terrors of a fanatic penitence very much akin\nto insanity.\n\nIt is probable that, as a result of feigning remorse in order to find\nfavour among his fellows, he had at last, after the failure of his\nplans, and under the terrible asceticism of his order, actually\nexperienced the horrors and agonies of a bad conscience and tardy\nrepentance. The fear of hell is the only creed of vile souls.\n\nNo sooner was I acquitted and set at liberty, with my character\ncompletely cleared, than I hastened to Edmee. I arrived in time to\nwitness my great-uncle's last moments. Towards the end, though his mind\nremained a blank as to past events, the memory of his heart returned. He\nrecognised me, clasped me to his breast, blessed me at the same time as\nEdmee, and put my hand into his daughter's. After we had paid the last\ntribute of affection to our excellent and noble kinsman, whom we were as\ngrieved to lose as if we had not long foreseen and expected his death,\nwe left the province for some time, so as not to witness the execution\nof Antony, who was condemned to be broken on the wheel. The two false\nwitnesses who had accused me were flogged, branded, and expelled from\nthe jurisdiction of the court. Mademoiselle Leblanc, who could not\nexactly be accused of giving false evidence, since hers had consisted of\nmere inferences from facts, avoided the public displeasure by going to\nanother province. Here she lived in sufficient luxury to make us suspect\nthat she had been paid considerable sums to bring about my ruin.\n\nEdmee and I would not consent to be separated, even temporarily, from\nour good friends, my sole defenders, Marcasse, Patience, Arthur, and the\nAbbe Aubert. We all travelled in the same carriage; the first two, being\naccustomed to the open air, were only too glad to sit outside; but we\ntreated them on a footing of perfect equality. From that day forth they\nnever sat at any table but our own. Some persons had the bad taste to\nexpress astonishment at this; we let them talk. There are circumstances\nthat obliterate all distinctions, real or imaginary, of rank and\neducation.\n\nWe paid a visit to Switzerland. Arthur considered this was essential\nto the complete restoration of Edmee's health. The delicate, thoughtful\nattentions of this devoted friend, and the loving efforts we made to\nminister to her happiness, combined into the beautiful spectacle of the\nmountains to drive away her melancholy and efface the recollection of\nthe troublous times through which we had just passed. On Patience's\npoetic nature Switzerland had quite a magic effect. He would frequently\nfall into such a state of ecstasy that we were entranced and terrified\nat the same time. He felt strongly tempted to build himself a chalet\nin the heart of some valley and spend the rest of his life there in\ncontemplation of Nature; but his affection for us made him abandon this\nproject. As for Marcasse, he declared subsequently that, despite all the\npleasure he had derived from our society, he looked upon this visit\nas the most unlucky event of his life. At the inn at Martigny, on our\nreturn journey, Blaireau, whose digestion had been impaired by age,\nfell a victim to the excess of hospitality shown him in the kitchen. The\nsergeant said not a word, but gazed on him awhile with heavy eye, and\nthen went and buried him under the most beautiful rose-tree in the\ngarden; nor did he speak of his loss until more than a year later.\n\nDuring our journey Edmee was for me a veritable angel of kindness and\ntender thought; abandoning herself henceforth to all the inspirations of\nher heart, and no longer feeling any distrust of me, or perhaps thinking\nthat I deserved some compensation for all my sufferings, she repeatedly\nconfirmed the celestial assurances of love which she had given in\npublic, when she lifted up her voice to proclaim my innocence. A few\nreservations that had struck me in her evidence, and a recollection of\nthe damning words that had fallen from her lips when Patience found her\nshot, continued, I must confess, to cause me pain for some time longer.\nI thought, rightly perhaps, that Edmee had made a great effort to\nbelieve in my innocence before Patience had given his evidence. But on\nthis point she always spoke most unwillingly and with a certain amount\nof reserve. However, one day she quite healed my wound by saying with\nher charming abruptness:\n\n\"And if I loved you enough to absolve you in my own heart, and defend\nyou in public at the cost of a lie, what would you say to that?\"\n\nA point on which I felt no less concern was to know how far I might\nbelieve in the love which she declared she had had for me from the very\nbeginning of our acquaintance. Here she betrayed a little confusion, as\nif, in her invincible pride, she regretted having revealed a secret she\nhad so jealously guarded. It was the abbe who undertook to confess for\nher. He assured me that at that time he had frequently scolded Edmee for\nher affection for \"the young savage.\" As an objection to this, I told\nhim of the conversation between Edmee and himself which I had overheard\none evening in the park. This I repeated with that great accuracy of\nmemory I possess. However, he replied:\n\n\"That very evening, if you had followed us a little further under the\ntrees, you might have overheard a dispute that would have completely\nreassured you, and have explained how, from being repugnant (I may\nalmost say odious) to me, as you then were, you became at first\nendurable, and gradually very dear.\"\n\n\"You must tell me,\" I exclaimed, \"who worked the miracle.\"\n\n\"One word will explain it,\" he answered; \"Edmee loved you. When she had\nconfessed this to me, she covered her face with her hands and remained\nfor a moment as if overwhelmed with shame and vexation; then suddenly\nshe raised her head and exclaimed:\n\n\"'Well, since you wish to know the absolute truth, I love him! Yes,\nI love him! I am smitten with him, as you say. It is not my fault; why\nshould I blush at it? I cannot help it; it is the work of fate. I have\nnever loved M. de la Marche; I merely feel a friendship for him. For\nBernard I have a very different feeling--a feeling so strong, so varied,\nso full of unrest, of hatred, of fear, of pity, of anger, of tenderness,\nthat I understand nothing about it, and no longer try to understand\nanything.'\"\n\n\"'Oh, woman, woman!' I exclaimed, clasping my hands in bewilderment,\n'thou art a mystery, an abyss, and he who thinks to know thee is totally\nmad!'\n\n\"'As many times as you like, abbe,' she answered, with a firmness in\nwhich there were signs of annoyance and confusion, 'it is all the same\nto me. On this point I have lectured myself more than you have lectured\nall your flocks in your whole life. I know that Bernard is a bear,\na badger, as Mademoiselle Leblanc calls him, a savage, a boor, and\nanything else you like. There is nothing more shaggy, more prickly, more\ncunning, more malicious than Bernard. He is an animal who scarcely knows\nhow to sign his name; he is a coarse brute who thinks he can break me in\nlike one of the jades of Varenne. But he makes a great mistake; I will\ndie rather than ever be his, unless he becomes civilized enough to\nmarry me. But one might as well expect a miracle. I try to improve him,\nwithout daring to hope. However, whether he forces me to kill myself or\nto turn nun, whether he remains as he is or becomes worse, it will be\nnone the less true that I love him. My dear abbe, you know that it must\nbe costing me something to make this confession; and, when my affection\nfor you brings me as a penitent to your feet and to your bosom, you\nshould not humiliate me by your expressions of surprise and your\nexorcisms! Consider the matter now; examine, discuss, decide! Consider\nthe matter now; examine, discuss, decide! The evil is--I love him. The\nsymptoms are--I think of none but him, I see none but him; and I could\neat no dinner this evening because he had not come back. I find him\nhandsomer than any man in the world. When he says that he loves me, I\ncan see, I can feel that it is true; I feel displeased, and at the same\ntime delighted. M. de la Marche seems insipid and prim since I have\nknown Bernard. Bernard alone seems as proud, as passionate, as bold as\nmyself--and as weak as myself; for he cries like a child when I vex him,\nand here I am crying, too, as I think of him.'\"\n\n\"Dear abbe,\" I said, throwing myself on his neck, \"let me embrace you\ntill I have crushed your life out for remembering all this.\"\n\n\"The abbe is drawing the long bow,\" said Edmee archly.\n\n\"What!\" I exclaimed, pressing her hands as if I would break them. \"You\nhave made me suffer for seven years, and now you repent a few words that\nconsole me . . .\"\n\n\"In any case do not regret the past,\" she said. \"Ah, with you such as\nyou were in those days, we should have been ruined if I had not been\nable to think and decide for both of us. Good God! what would have\nbecome of us by now? You would have had far more to suffer from my\nsternness and pride; for you would have offended me from the very first\nday of our union, and I should have had to punish you by running away\nor killing myself, or killing you--for we are given to killing in our\nfamily; it is a natural habit. One thing is certain, and that is that\nyou would have been a detestable husband; you would have made me blush\nfor your ignorance; you would have wanted to rule me, and we should have\nfallen foul of each other; that would have driven my father to despair,\nand, as you know, my father had to be considered before everything. I\nmight, perhaps, have risked my own fate lightly enough, if I had been\nalone in the world, for I have a strain of rashness in my nature; but\nit was essential that my father should remain happy, and tranquil, and\nrespected. He had brought me up in happiness and independence, and I\nshould never have forgiven myself if I had deprived his old age of the\nblessings he had lavished on my whole life. Do not think that I am full\nof virtues and noble qualities, as the abbe pretends; I love, that is\nall; but I love strongly, exclusively, steadfastly. I sacrificed you to\nmy father, my poor Bernard; and Heaven, who would have cursed us if I\nhad sacrificed my father, rewards us to-day by giving us to each other,\ntried and not found wanting. As you grew greater in my eyes I felt\nthat I could wait, because I knew I had to love you long, and I was not\nafraid of seeing my passion vanish before it was satisfied, as do the\npassions of feeble souls. We were two exceptional characters; our loves\nhad to be heroic; the beaten track would have led both of us to ruin.\"\n\n\n\n\nXXX\n\nWe returned to Sainte-Severe at the expiration of Edmee's period of\nmourning. This was the time that had been fixed for our marriage. When\nwe had quitted the province where we had both experienced so many bitter\nmortifications and such grievous trials, we had imagined that we\nshould never feel any inclination to return. Yet, so powerful are the\nrecollections of childhood and the ties of family life that, even in the\nheart of an enchanted land which could not arouse painful memories, we\nhad quickly begun to regret our gloomy, wild Varenne, and sighed for the\nold oaks in the park. We returned, then, with a sense of profound yet\nsolemn joy. Edmee's first care was to gather the beautiful flowers in\nthe garden and to kneel by her father's grave and arrange them on it. We\nkissed the hallowed ground, and there made a vow to strive unceasingly\nto leave a name as worthy of respect and veneration as his. He had\nfrequently carried this ambition to the verge of weakness, but it was a\nnoble weakness, a sacred vanity.\n\nOur marriage was celebrated in the village chapel, and the festivities\nwere confined to the family; none but Arthur, the abbe, Marcasse, and\nPatience sat down to our modest banquet. What need had we of the outside\nworld to behold our happiness? They might have believed, perhaps, that\nthey were doing us an honour by covering the blots on our escutcheon\nwith their august presence. We were enough to be happy and merry among\nourselves. Our hearts were filled with as much affection as they could\nhold. We were too proud to ask more from any one, too pleased with one\nanother to yearn for greater pleasure. Patience returned to his sober,\nretired life, resumed the duties of \"great judge\" and \"treasurer\" on\ncertain days of the week. Marcasse remained with me until his death,\nwhich happened towards the end of the French Revolution. I trust I\ndid my best to repay his fidelity by an unreserved friendship and an\nintimacy that nothing could disturb.\n\nArthur, who had sacrificed a year of his life to us, could not bring\nhimself to abjure the love of his country, and his desire to contribute\nto its progress by offering it the fruits of his learning and the\nresults of his investigations; he returned to Philadelphia, where I paid\nhim a visit after I was left a widower.\n\nI will not describe my years of happiness with my noble wife; such years\nbeggar description. One could not resign one's self to living after\nlosing them, if one did not make strenuous efforts to avoid recalling\nthem too often. She gave me six children; four of these are still alive,\nand all honourably settled in life. I have lived for them, in obedience\nto Edmee's dying command. You must forgive me for not speaking further\nof this loss, which I suffered only ten years ago. I feel it now as\nkeenly as on the first day, and I do not seek to find consolation for\nit, but to make myself worthy of rejoining the holy comrade of my life\nin a better world after I have completed my period of probation in this.\nShe was the only woman I ever loved; never did any other win a glance\nfrom me or know the pressure of my hand. Such is my nature; what I love\nI love eternally, in the past, in the present, in the future.\n\nThe storms of the Revolution did not destroy our existence, nor did the\npassions it aroused disturb the harmony of our private life. We gladly\ngave up a large part of our property to the Republic, looking upon\nit, indeed, as a just sacrifice. The abbe, terrified by the bloodshed,\noccasionally abjured this political faith, when the necessities of the\nhour were too much for the strength of his soul. He was the Girondin of\nthe family.\n\nWith no less sensibility, Edmee had greater courage; a woman and\ncompassionate, she sympathized profoundly with the sufferings of all\nclasses. She bewailed the misfortune of her age; but she never failed to\nappreciate the greatness of its holy fanaticism. She remained faithful\nto her ideas of absolute equality. At a time when the acts of the\nMountain were irritating the abbe, and driving him to despair, she\ngenerously sacrificed her own patriotic enthusiasm; and her delicacy\nwould never let her mention in his presence certain names that made\nhim shudder, names for which she herself had a sort of passionate\nveneration, the like of which I have never seen in any woman.\n\nAs for myself, I can truthfully say that it was she who educated me;\nduring the whole course of my life I had the profoundest respect for\nher judgment and rectitude. When, in my enthusiasm, I was filled with\na longing to play a part as a leader of the people, she held me back by\nshowing how my name would destroy any influence I might have; since they\nwould distrust me, and imagine my aim was to use them as an instrument\nfor recovering my rank. When the enemy was at the gates of France, she\nsent me to serve as a volunteer; when the Republic was overthrown, and\na military career came to be merely a means of gratifying ambition, she\nrecalled me, and said:\n\n\"You must never leave me again.\"\n\nPatience played a great part in the Revolution. He was unanimously\nchosen as judge of his district. His integrity, his impartiality between\ncastle and cottage, his firmness and wisdom will never be forgotten in\nVarenne.\n\nDuring the war I was instrumental in saving M. de la Marche's life, and\nhelping him to escape to a foreign country.\n\nSuch, I believe, said old Mauprat, are all the events of my life in\nwhich Edmee played a part. The rest of it is not worth the telling.\nIf there is anything helpful in my story, try to profit by it, young\nfellows. Hope to be blessed with a frank counsellor, a severe friend;\nand love not the man who flatters, but the man who reproves. Do not\nbelieve too much in phrenology; for I have the murderer's bump largely\ndeveloped, and, as Edmee used to say with grim humour, \"killing comes\nnatural\" to our family. Do not believe in fate, or, at least, never\nadvise any one to tamely submit to it. Such is the moral of my story.\n\n\nAfter this old Bernard gave us a good supper, and continued conversing\nwith us for the rest of the evening without showing any signs of\ndiscomposure or fatigue. As we begged him to develop what he called\nthe moral of his story a little further, he proceeded to a few general\nconsiderations which impressed me with their soundness and good sense.\n\nI spoke of phrenology, he said, not with the object of criticising a\nsystem which has its good side, in so far as it tends to complete\nthe series of physiological observations that aim at increasing our\nknowledge of man; I used the word phrenology because the only fatality\nthat we believe in nowadays is that created by our own instincts. I do\nnot believe that phrenology is more fatalistic than any other system of\nthis kind; and Lavater, who was also accused of fatalism in his time,\nwas the most Christian man the Gospel has ever formed.\n\nDo not believe in any absolute and inevitable fate; and yet acknowledge,\nin a measure, that we are moulded by instincts, our faculties,\nthe impressions of our infancy, the surroundings of our earliest\nchildhood--in short, by all that outside world which has presided over\nthe development of our soul. Admit that we are not always absolutely\nfree to choose between good and evil, if you would be indulgent towards\nthe guilty--that is to say, just even as Heaven is just; for there\nis infinite mercy in God's judgments; otherwise His justice would be\nimperfect.\n\nWhat I am saying now is not very orthodox, but, take my word for it, it\nis Christian, because it is true. Man is not born wicked; neither is he\nborn good, as is maintained by Jean Jacques Rousseau, my beloved Edmee's\nold master. Man is born with more or less of passions, with more or less\npower to satisfy them, with more or less capacity for turning them to a\ngood or bad account in society. But education can and must find a remedy\nfor everything; that is the great problem to be solved, to discover the\neducation best suited to each individual. If it seems necessary that\neducation should be general and in common, does it follow that it ought\nto be the same for all? I quite believe that if I had been sent to\nschool when I was ten, I should have become a civilized being earlier;\nbut would any one have thought of correcting my violent passions, and\nof teaching me how to conquer them as Edmee did? I doubt it. Every\nman needs to be loved before he can be worth anything; but each in\na different way; one with never-failing indulgence, another with\nunflinching severity. Meanwhile, until some one solves the problem of\nmaking education common to all, and yet appropriate to each, try to\nimprove one another.\n\nDo you ask me how? My answer will be brief: by loving one another truly.\nIt is in this way--for the manners of a people mould their laws--that\nyou will succeed in suppressing the most odious and impious of all laws,\nthe _lex talionis_, capital punishment, which is nothing else than the\nconsecration of the principle of fatality, seeing that it supposes the\nculprit incorrigible and Heaven implacable.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Mauprat, by George Sand\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK MAUPRAT ***\n\n***** This file should be named 2194.txt or 2194.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/2\/1\/9\/2194\/\n\nProduced by Dagny; John Bickers and David Widger\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp:\/\/pglaf.org\/fundraising.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":556,"split":"train"}
