They promptly inform Hector, who almost issues a general call to arms before Aeneas makes him see how ill-advised this would be. Their best bet, Aeneas argues, would be to send someone to spy on the Greek camp and see what the enemy is up to. Dolon volunteers to spy on the Greeks in exchange for Achilles's horses when the war is won. Hector accepts the deal and sends him out. Dolon leaves wearing the skin of a wolf, and plans on deceiving the Greeks by walking on all fours. Rhesus, the neighboring king of Thrace, arrives to assist the Trojans soon after Dolon sets out. Hector berates him for coming so many years late, but decides better late than never. Rhesus says he intended on coming in the beginning, but was sidetracked defending his own land from an attack by Scythians.\nMeanwhile, on their way into the Trojan encampment, Odysseus and Diomedes run into Dolon and kill him. When they reach the encampment with the intention of killing Hector, Athena guides them to Rhesus' sleeping quarters instead, pointing out that they are not destined to kill Hector. Diomedes slays Rhesus and others while Odysseus takes his prized horses before making their escape. Rumors spread from Rhesus' men that it was an inside job, and that Hector was responsible. Hector arrives to cast blame on the sentinels for, due to the sly tactics, the guilty party could only be Odysseus. The mother of Rhesus, one of the nine muses, then arrives and lays blame on all those responsible: Odysseus, Diomedes, and Athena. She also announces the imminent resurrection of Rhesus, who will become immortal but will be sent to live in an underground cave.\nThis short play is most notable in comparison with the Iliad. The part with Dolon is pushed to the background, and much more is revealed about Rhesus and the reactions of the Trojans to his murder.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of The Rhesus of Euripedes, by Euripedes\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

It has had the bad\nfortune to become a literary problem, and almost all its few readers are\nso much occupied with the question whether it can be the work of\nEuripides--and if not his, whose?--that they seldom allow themselves to\ntake it on its merits as a stirring and adventurous piece, not\nparticularly profound or subtle, but always full of movement and life\nand possessing at least one or two scenes of great and penetrating\nbeauty.\n\nThe outlines of the _Rhesus_ Question are these.--The _Rhesus_ appears\nin the MSS. of Euripides; we know from the Athenian Didascaliae, or\nRecords of Performances, that Euripides wrote a play of the name; some\npassages in it are quoted by early Alexandrian writers as from \"the\n_Rhesus_ of Euripides;\" no passage is quoted under any other name. This\nseems about as strong as external evidence need be. Yet the ancient\nintroduction to the play mentions that \"some think the play spurious,\"\nand expresses the odd opinion that \"it suggests rather the Sophoclean\nstyle.\" Further, it tells us that, besides the present opening scene,\nthere were extant two different prologues, one of which was \"quite prosy\nand perhaps concocted by the actors.\" This seems to show that the\nAlexandrian scholars who tried for the first time to collect the\ncomplete works of Euripides, some two centuries after his death, found\nthis play current as \"Euripides' _Rhesus_,\" but that it was credited\nwith three different openings and that its style was felt to be somehow\npeculiar.\n\nThe peculiarity of style is incontestable. It does not to our judgment\nsuggest Sophocles. It suggests a young man imitating Aeschylus, and it\nhas a great number of Euripidean expressions. Hermann, who collected\nwhat he took to be \"imitations\" of early poets in the _Rhesus_, noted\nonly 25 of Sophocles, 38 of Aeschylus, and 84 of Euripides.\n\nIs it, then, the work of a somewhat imitative fourth-century poet,\nnaturally influenced by his great forerunners? Hardly: because, with a\nfew exceptions, the verse and diction of the _Rhesus_, are markedly\nearly in character, the verse severe and smooth, the diction direct and\nrather grandiose, the choral lyrics strictly relevant. In Euripides'\nlater years Drama was moving rapidly away from all these things and, as\nfar as we can judge, continued so moving after his death. If the\n_Rhesus_ is a post-classical play it can hardly be honest fourth-century\nwork: it must be deliberately archaistic, a product of the Alexandrian\nspirit if not actually of the Alexandrian age. This is what Hermann\nbelieved. But unfortunately it is not a bit more like our fragments of\nAlexandrian tragedy than it is like the _Medea_; and, further, if it is\nan Alexandrian pseudo-classic tragedy, how did it succeed in deceiving\nthe Alexandrian critics, detectives specially trained for this kind of\nwork?\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\nLet us try quite a different hypothesis, and begin by accepting the\nexternal evidence as true. The famous critic, Crates, of the second\ncentury B.C., happens to mention--in excuse of what he took to be a slip\nin the poet's astronomy--that the _Rhesus_ of Euripides was a youthful\nwork. Now the earliest dated tragedy of Euripides that we possess is the\n_Alcestis_, B.C. 438, written when he was about forty-six. His style may\nwell have been considerably different fifteen or twenty years earlier,\nand must certainly have been much under the influence of Aeschylus. So\nfar, so good. Then what of the other difficulties, the three different\nopening scenes and the few passages of late phrasing or technique? One\nobvious explanation suits both. The three different openings pretty\nclearly imply that the play was reproduced more than once after the\npoet's death and adapted by the producer for each occasion. This\nhappened to many plays of Euripides, and in one case we even know the\nname of the producer; he was Euripides the Younger, son of the poet.\nAmong other things we have reason to believe that he wrote some parts of\nthe _Iphigenia in Aulis_. And in this connexion we can hardly help\nnoticing that the _Iphigenia in Aulis_, like the _Rhesus_ and like no\nother Greek tragedy, has two alternative openings, one a dull prologue\nand one a lyrical scene in anapaests under the stars. The general style\nof the two plays is utterly different; the _Iphigenia_ is most typically\nlate Euripidean; but one would not be surprised to learn that they had\nboth passed at some time through the same revising hand.\n\nThis hypothesis seems to work well. But one difficulty remains.\n\nWe have so far gone on the supposition that Euripides at twenty-five or\nthirty perhaps wrote very differently from Euripides at forty-six, and\nthat the manner we call Euripidean is only the manner of his later life.\nThere is nothing improbable in this suggestion, but have we any\nevidence? Yes, a very little, and unfortunately it does not say what we\nwant. We have some fragments--twenty lines altogether--preserved from\nthe _Peliades_, with which Euripides won his first victory in the year\n455, seventeen years before the _Alcestis_, and as far as they go they\nare just in his ordinary manner--a good deal more so, in fact, than much\nof the _Alcestis_ is. Let us face this difficulty.\n\nThe ordinary style of Euripides is full, flexible, lucid, antithetic,\nstudiously simple in vocabulary and charged with philosophic reflection.\nIf we look in his extant remains for any trace of a style, like that of\nthe _Rhesus_, which is comparatively terse, rich, romantic, not\nshrinking from rare words and strong colour and generally untinged by\nphilosophy, we shall find the nearest approach to it in the _Cyclops_.\nNext to the _Cyclops_ I am not sure what play would come, but the\n_Alcestis_ would not be far off. It has especially several Epic forms\nwhich cannot be paralleled in tragedy. Now the conjunction of these two\nplays with the _Rhesus_ is significant. The three seem to be three\nearliest of the extant plays; they are also--if we count the\n_Heraclidae_ as mutilated--the three shortest. But, what is more\nimportant, the _Cyclops_ is not a tragedy but a satyr-play, and the\n_Alcestis_ is a tragedy of a special sort, written to take the place of\na satyr-play. It is a tragedy with some half grotesque figures and a\nfantastic atmosphere.\n\nThis is no place for a close analysis of the diction of the various\nworks of Euripides; but taking one rough test, just for what it is\nworth, we may try to count the number of words in each play which are\nnot found elsewhere in Euripides. The _Medea_, a central sort of play,\nhas in its 1419 lines 103 such words. The _Alcestis_, with 1163 lines,\nhas 122; the _Rhesus_, with less than 1000 lines, has 177; the\n_Cyclops_, with only 701 lines, has actually 220. This calculation is\ndoubtless slightly inexact: in any case it is worth very little until it\nis carefully analysed. But on the whole it accords with my general\nimpression that the _Rhesus_ in its variation from the Euripidean norm\ngoes further than the _Alcestis_, and not so far as the _Cyclops_, and\ngoes in very much the same direction. I feel in the _Rhesus_ a good deal\nof that curious atmosphere, not exactly comic, but wild and extravagant,\nwhich the Greeks felt to be suited to the Satyr horde; the atmosphere\nnormally breathed by the one-eyed Giant of the cavern on volcanic Aetna,\nor the drunken and garlanded Heracles who wrestles with Death and cracks\nhis ribs for him at midnight among the tombs. The whole scene and\nsetting of the _Rhesus_; the man-wolf crawling away into the darkness\nand his two enemies presently crawling in out of the same darkness with\nhis bloody spoils; the divine Thracian king with his round targe that\nshines by night and his horses whiter than the snow; the panic of the\nwatch, the vaunting of the doomed chieftain, the goddess disguised as\nanother goddess, the thrilling half-farcical scene where the spy\nOdysseus is actually caught and befools his captors: these things are\nnot of course comic, like some incidents in the _Cyclops_. They belong\nto tragedy; but they are near the outside limit of the tragic\nconvention, and would perhaps be most at home in a pro-satyric tragedy\nlike the _Alcestis_.\n\nIn the upshot I see no adequate reason for rejecting the external\nevidence which makes this play a work of Euripides, if we suppose it to\nbe an early pro-satyric play which was produced again after the poet's\ndeath by Euripides the Younger or some contemporary. Most scholars,\nhowever, prefer to think it simply an archaistic work of the fourth\ncentury.\n\nOn this theory the Alexandrians when looking for the _Rhesus_ of\nEuripides found an anonymous play called _Rhesus_ and accepted it for\nwhat it was worth. The Prologues mentioned in the argument would perhaps\nbelong to other plays of the same name; one, no doubt, to the real play\nof Euripides. The rich and severe style may, for all we know--for direct\nevidence fails us--be the natural mark of some reactionary archaistic\nschool about the time of Plato or Aristotle. The same date might well be\nindicated by the great interest our play takes in the Iliad, and by its\nalmost \"Alexandrian\" use of the gods as ornamental machinery. I cannot\ncall such a theory improbable; but it really amounts to rejecting the\nexternal evidence in order to place the _Rhesus_ in a period of tragic\nstyle of which we happen to know nothing. It is certainly not confirmed\nby the scanty fragments we possess of Theodectes or Chairemon.\n\nAnd, if one is to venture into more speculative and subjective\narguments, I find it rather hard to think of any lyric poet except\nEuripides who could have written the Adrasteia chorus or the lines about\nthe Nightingale in the Watchers' Song; of any playwright except\nEuripides who would have ended a play of gallant martial adventure with\nthe vision of a solitary mother clasping her dead son. There are many\nother passages, too, like the mysterious sobbing in the dark that\nheralds the entry of the wounded Thracian, and the final passing out of\nthe army to its certain defeat, which seem to me more like undeveloped\ngenius than common imitative mediocrity. If a nameless fourth-century\npoet wrote this play, I think we should have heard more of him.\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe story of the play is taken straight from the Doloneia, an Epic\nrhapsody which now takes its place as the Tenth Book of the Iliad, but\nwas very likely independent in the time of Euripides (_Rise of the Greek\nEpic_, p. 313 f.). The play seems in one or two points to follow a more\narchaic model than the version in our Homer. (See notes on l. 150 and l.\n175.)\n\nIn Rhesus himself--the name is said to be the Thracian form of\n_rex_[1]--we seem to have the traditional divine king of the Thracian\ntribes about Pangaion, seen through the eyes of Greek romance. He is the\nson of the greatest of Rivers and the Muse of the Mountain: she is\nsimply \"The Muse,\" otherwise nameless, and we are lost if we try to bind\nher down to the identity of any Greek goddess. Like many Thracian heroes\nRhesus has a dash of the Sun-god in him, the burning targe, the white\nhorses and the splendour. Like them he is a boaster and a deep drinker,\na child of battle and of song. Like other divine kings he dies in his\nyouth and strength, and keeps watch over his people from some \"feasting\npresence, full of light,\" where he lies among the buried silver-veins of\nPangaion. If the uttermost need comes, doubtless he will wake again.\nWhen the Athenians began making their dangerous settlements on the coast\nof Thrace--ten thousand settlers were massacred by Rhesus's people about\n465 B.C.: Amphipolis not fully established till 437--they found the\nlegend of Rhesus in the air, and eventually they thought it prudent to\nsend for his hallowed bones from the Troad, where they were supposed to\nbe buried, and give them a tomb in the Athenian colony. Possibly that\npacified him. And his legend in the mouth of the poets seemed perhaps\nlike the story of his own mountaineers, multitudes of strong men, stormy\nand chivalrous, terrible in onset, who somehow in the end melted away\nbefore the skill and persistent courage of a civilised Greek city.\n\n[Footnote 1: Perdrizet, _Cultes et Mythes de Pang\u00c3\u00a9e_, p. 17.]\n\n\n\n\nRHESUS\n\n\n\n\nCHARACTERS OF THE PLAY\n\n\nHECTOR, _Prince of \u00c3\u008elion and General of the Trojan Armies_.\nAEN\u00c3\u008aAS, _a Trojan Prince_.\nDOLON, _a Trojan_.\nPARIS, _also called_ ALEXANDER, _brother of Hector_.\nRH\u00c3\u008aSUS, _King of Thrace, son of the River Str[^y]mon and the Muse\n    of the Mountains_.\nA THRACIAN, _the King's charioteer_.\nODYSSEUS, _a Greek chieftain, famous for craft and daring_.\nDIOM\u00c3\u008aD\u00c3\u008aS, _a Greek chieftain, famous for valour_.\nA SHEPHERD.\n\nThe Goddess ATH\u00c3\u008aNA.\nThe MUSE OF THE MOUNTAINS.\n\nCHORUS _of Trojan Guards with their_ LEADER.\n_Some_ THRACIANS _with their_ CAPTAIN, _Attendants, &c._\n\n_The date and authorship of the play are unknown; it probably\nbelongs to the Fifth Century B.C., and is attributed to Euripides._\n\n\n\n\n                      RHESUS\n\n\n_It is a cloudy but moonlight night on the plain before Troy.

I wear no double heart.\n  Long, long ago thou shouldst have borne thy part                 [vv. 396-421]\nIn Ilion's labours, not have left us here,\nFor all thy help, to sink beneath the spear.\nWhy didst thou--not for lack of need made plain!--\nNot come, not send, not think of us again?\nWhat grave ambassadors prayed not before\nThy throne, what herald knelt not at thy door?\nWhat pride of gifts did Troy not send to thee?\nAnd thou, a lord of Barbary even as we,\nThou, brother of our blood, like one at sup\nWho quaffs his fill and flings away the cup,\nHast flung to the Greeks my city! Yet, long since,\n'Twas I that found thee but a little prince\nAnd made thee mighty, I and this right hand;\nWhen round Pangaion and the Pai\u00c3\u00b4n's land,\nFront against front, I burst upon the brood\nOf Thrace and broke their targes, and subdued\nTheir power to thine. The grace whereof, not small,\nThou hast spurned, and when thy kinsmen, drowning, call,\nComest too late. Thou! Others there have been\nThese long years, not by nature of our kin . . .\nSome under yon rough barrows thou canst see\nLie buried; they were true to Troy and me;\nAnd others, yet here in the shielded line\nOr mid the chariots, parching in the shine\nOf noonday, starving in the winds that bite\nThrough Ilion's winter, still endure and fight\nOn at my side. 'Twas not their way, to lie\nOn a soft couch and, while the cups go by,\nPledge my good health, like thee, in Thracian wine.\n  I speak as a free man. With thee and thine\nHector is wroth, and tells thee to thy face.\n\n                      RHESUS.                                      [vv. 422-448]\n\nThy way is mine, friend. Straight I run my race\nIn word and deed, and bear no double tongue.\n  I tell thee, more than thine my heart was wrung,\nYea, angered past all durance, thus to stay\nBack from thy battles. 'Twas a folk that lay\nHard on my borders, Scythians of the north;\nJust when my host for Troy had started forth,\nThey fell upon our homes. I had reached the coast\nOf the Friendless Sea and purposed to have crossed\nMy Thracians there. We turned; and all that plain\nIs trampled in a mire of Scythian slain\nPloughed by our spears, and blood of Thrace withal\nNot stinted. This it was that drowned thy call\nFor help and held me back from Ilion's need.\nI broke their power; the princes of their breed\nI took to hostage, made their elders swear\nTo bring my house due tribute, year by year,\nThen, never lagging, crossed the Pontus mouth,\nMarched by long stages through Bithynia south\nAnd here am come . . . not drunken with the feast,\nAs thou wouldst have me be, not lulled to rest\nIn golden chambers. In this harness hard\nI have borne my nights of winter storm that starred\nThe Euxine into ice and scared the strong\nPaionians.\n            Long I have been, but not too long\nTo save thee yet. Friend, this is the tenth year\nThou labourest on unceasing, with no clear\nVantage; day creeps by day, and Ares throws\nThe same red dice for thee and for thy foes.\nNow, hear my vow. Before one day's eclipse\nI swear to break their wall, to burn their ships\nAnd slay their princes. On the second day                          [vv. 449-473]\nI leave this soil and take my homeward way,\nThy pains relieved. No Trojan of the land\nNeed move, nor turn the buckler in his hand.\nAlone my late-comers will turn the tide\nAnd smite your Greeks, for all their bitter pride.\n\n                      CHORUS.\n\n[_The Trojan soldiers, who have been listening with delight, here break\n    out in irrepressible applause._\n\n    All hail!\n    Sweet words and faithful heart!\n    Only may Zeus avert\nFrom those proud lips the Wrath that none may bear!\n    Never a galleon bore,\n    Now, nor in days of yore,\nPrince like to thee, so valiant and so fair.\n    How shall Achilles, how\n    Shall Ajax bear him now,\nOr face thy lance?

And in every ambush they have set\nBy the old Altar, close to Troy, we know\nHe sits--a murderous reptile of a foe!\n\n                      RHESUS.                                      [vv. 510-529]\n\nNo brave man seeks so dastardly to harm\nHis battle-foes; he meets them arm to arm.\nThis Greek of thine, this sitter like a thief\nIn ambush, I will make of him my chief\nCare.

We are not only supposed to know\nthat Hector, son of Priam, leads the Trojans and their allies (\"Trojans,\nand Lycians, and Dardans bold\": in tragedy they are also called\nPhrygians) in defence against the Greeks--Argives, Achaeans,\nHell\u00c3\u00aanes--under Agamemnon, king of men, and his brother Menela\u00c3\u00bcs,\nhusband of Helen. This sort of supposition is usual in all Greek\ntragedy. It merely means that the poet takes for granted the main\noutlines of the heroic saga. But in this play we are also supposed to\ntake up the story as it stands at the opening of the Doloneia or Tenth\nBook of the Iliad. Indeed one might almost say that the _Rhesus_ is\nsimply the Doloneia turned into drama and set in the Trojan camp. The\nonly other play that is taken straight from Homer is the Satyr-play,\n_Cyclops_, which tells the story of Odyssey IX., but it is likely enough\nthat if we possessed more of the earlier epic literature we should find\nmany other plays closely hugging their traditional sources.--The Trojans\nare camping out on the field of battle, close to the Greek lines.\nHector, always ready for danger, seems to have his tent or log-hut set\nup quite in the van, just behind the outposts. In Il. X. 415 ff. he is\nholding counsel with the other chieftains \"away from the throng\"; the\nallies are taking their sleep and trusting to the Trojans, who keep\nawake in groups round the camp fires; no watchword is mentioned.\n\nP. 5, l. 30, The priest.]--He would be needed to make the sacrifice\nbefore battle.\n\nP. 5, l. 36, The lash of trembling Pan.]--_i.e._, a panic.\n\nP. 5, l. 41, Great beacons in the Argive line.]--In the Iliad it is the\nTrojan watch-fires that are specially mentioned, especially VIII.\n553-end. There is no great disturbance in the Greek camp in the\nDoloneia; there is a gathering of the principal chiefs, a visit to the\nGuards, and the despatch of the two spies, but no general tumult such as\nthere is in Book II. One cannot help wondering whether our playwright\nfound in his version of the Doloneia a description of fires in the Greek\ncamp, such as our Eighth Book has of those in the Trojan camp. The\nobject might be merely protection against a night attack, or it might be\na wish to fly, as Hector thinks. If so, presumably the Assembly changed\nits mind--much as it does in our Book II.--and determined to send spies.\n\nP. 5, l. 43 ff., The shipyard timbers.]--The Greeks had their ships\ndrawn up on the beach and protected by some sort of wooden \"shipyard\";\nthen came the camp; then, outside the whole, a trench and a wall. The\nfires were in the camp.\n\nP. 8, l. 105, Brother! I would thy wit were like thy spear!]--In Homer\nHector is impulsive and over-daring, but still good in counsel. On the\nstage every quality that is characteristic is apt to be overemphasized,\nall that is not characteristic neglected. Hence on the Attic stage\nOdysseus is more crafty, Ajax and Diomedes more blunt, Menelaus more\nunwarlike and more uxorious than in Homer.\n\nThis speech of Aeneas, though not inapposite, is rather didactic--a\nfault which always remained a danger to Euripides.\n\nP. 10, l. 150 ff., Dolon.]--The name is derived from _dolos_, \"craft.\"\nIn our version of Homer Dolon merely wears, over his tunic, the skin of\na grey wolf. He has a leather cap and a bow. In the play he goes, as Red\nIndian spies used to go, actually disguised as a wolf, on all fours in a\ncomplete wolf-skin. The same version is found on the Munich cylix of the\nearly vase-painter Euphronius (about 500 B.C.), in which Dolon wears a\ntight-fitting hairy skin with a long tail. The plan can of course only\nsucceed in a country where wild animals are common enough to be thought\nunimportant. The playwright has evidently chosen a more primitive and\nromantic version of the story; the Homeric reviser has, as usual, cut\nout what might seem ridiculous. (See J. A. K. Thomson in _Classical\nReview_, xxv. pp. 238 f.)\n\nP. 12, l. 175, Ajax, \u00c3\u008eleus' son.]--\"Ajax\" is mentioned here and at ll.\n463, 497, 601, as apparently next in importance to the two Atreidae or\nto Achilles. That is natural, but it is a shock to have him here\ndescribed as son of Ileus. In the Iliad we should have had \"Ajax son of\nTelamon.\" The son of Ileus is \"Ajax the less,\" a hero of the second\nrank. Scholars have conjectured on other grounds that in some older form\nof the Iliad-saga Ajax son of Ileus was of much greater importance. The\nfather \"Telamon\" and the connection with Aegina are neither of them\noriginal in the myth.\n\nP. 12, l. 182, Achilles' horses.]--They are as glorious in the Iliad as\nthey are here. Cf. especially the passages where they bear Automedon out\nof the battle (end of XVI.), and where Xanthos is given a human voice to\nwarn his master of the coming of death (end of XIX.). The heroic age of\nGreece delighted in horses. Cf. those of Aeneas, Diomedes, Eum\u00c3\u00aalus, and\nRhesus himself.\n\nP. 15, ll. 225-263, Chorus.]--Apollo is appealed to as a God of Thymbra\nin the Troad, of Delos the Ionian island, and of Lycia in the South of\nAsia Minor; the god of Asiatics and _barbaroi_, the enemy of the\nAchaeans. This is also to a great extent the conception of Apollo in the\nIliad, where he fights for Troy and is Hector's special patron. The\nsudden ferocity towards Helen in the last strophe is quite in the manner\nof Euripides; cf. _Trojan Women_, 1107 ff. (p. 65), 766 ff. (p. 49), and\noften; also _Iph. Taur._ 438 ff. (p. 21), where her name comes somewhat\nas a surprise.\n\nThe stage directions here are of course conjectural: it does not seem\nlikely that the playwright, having made Dolon describe his wolf's\ndisguise in detail, would waste the opportunity of making him crawl off\nin it. Cf. on l. 594, p. 63, and at the end of the play.\n\nP. 16, l. 267. Hector is as bluff and hasty here as he is impulsively\nobstinate in l. 319 ff., p. 19, impulsively frank to Rhesus in l. 393\nff., p. 23, and splendidly courteous under the gibes of the wounded\ncharioteer, l. 856 ff., p. 47. A fine stage character, if not a very\nsubtle study.\n\nP. 17, l. 284 ff. The description of the march of the mountaineers, the\nvast crowd, the noise, the mixture of all arms, suggests personal\nobservation. A great many fifth-century Athenians had probably served\nsome time or other in Thrace.\n\nP. 20, l. 342, Adrasteia.]--She-from-whom-there-is-no-Running, is a\ngoddess identified with Nemesis, a requiter of sin, especially the sin\nof pride or overconfidence. In spite of the opening apology this whole\nchorus, with its boundless exultation, is an offence against her.--It is\ninteresting to notice that a town and a whole district in the north of\nthe Troad was called by her name; the poet is using local colour in\nmaking his Trojans here, and Rhesus in l. 468, speak of her. There seems\nalso to be something characteristically Thracian in the story of the\nMuse and the River, in the title \"Zeus of the Dawn\" given to Rhesus, in\nthe revelry to be held when Ilion is free, and in the conception of the\nking in his dazzling chariot, Sun-god-like.\n\nP. 23, ll. 394-453, Speeches of Hector and Rhesus.]--The scene reads to\nme like a rather crude and early form of the celebrated psychological\ncontroversies of Euripides. It is simple, but spirited and in character.\nThe description of Thracian fighting again suggests personal knowledge,\nand so does the boasting. The Thracians apparently bound themselves with\nheroic boasts before battle much as Irish and Highland chieftains\nsometimes did, or as the Franks did with their _gabs_. (See, _e.g., Le\nP\u00c3\u00a8lerinage de Charlemagne_, as described in Gaston Paris, _Litt. du\nMoyen Age_, I. p. 122 ff.) It was a disgrace if you did not fulfil your\n_gab_ afterwards.\n\nRhesus's defence is apparently true, though in a modern play one would\nhave expected some explanation of the rather different story that his\nmother tells, l. 933 ff., p. 51. Perhaps he did not realise how she was\nholding him back. In any case ancient technique prefers to leave such\ndetails unsettled: cf., for instance, Helen's speech in the _Trojan\nWomen_, in which the false is evidently mixed up with the true, and they\nare never separated afterwards.\n\nP. 25, ll. 454 ff. This little Chorus seems to represent--in due tragic\nconvention--an irrepressible outburst of applause from the Trojans,\ninterrupting Rhesus's speech. In spite of the words about possible\n\"wrath\" that may follow the Thracian's boasting, the applause excites\nhim at once to a yet bolder _gab_.\n\nP. 26, l. 480. It may be remarked that the play here uses a fairly\ncommon Homeric phrase in a sense which the scholars of our tradition\nknew but rejected.\n\nP. 27, l. 501 ff. These three achievements of Odysseus are all in the\ntraditional saga. The Rapt of the Palladium, or figure of Pallas, by\nOdysseus and Diomedes, was in an old lost epic, called The Little Iliad;\nthe Begging in Troy in the Little Iliad and also in Odyssey IV. 242 ff.;\nthe great ambuscades in Odyssey IV. 290 ff., VIII. 493 ff., and in\nOdysseus's own feigned story, XIV. 468 ff. According to our tradition\nthey belong to a later period of the war than the death of Rhesus, but\nperhaps the sequence was different, or not so definite, at the time of\nthis play.\n\nP. 28, l. 528. Rhesus shows the simple courage of a barbarian in his\ncontempt for the ruses of Odysseus, the brutality of a barbarian in the\nmethods of punishment he proposes. Such proposals would disgust a Greek;\nit looks as if they displeased Hector. In any case his abruptness here,\nand his careful indication of the place where the Thracians are to\nsleep, far from the rest of the camp, have some dramatic value for the\nsequel.\n\nPp. 28-30, ll. 527-564, Stars and Nightingale chorus.]--The beauty of\nthese lines in the Greek is quite magical, but the stage management of\nthe scene is difficult. Apparently Hector (l. 523) bids the Guards come\nforward from where they are and wait nearer the front for Dolon; obeying\nthis they come up from the orchestra, we may suppose, to the stage. Then\nwatching somewhere near Hector's tent they partly express, in the usual\nsong, the lyrical emotion of the night, partly they chat about Dolon and\nthe order of the watches. The scene is technically very interesting with\nits rather abrupt introduction of realism into the high convention of\ntragedy. Meantime the Trojans' time of watch is over and the Lycians,\nwho ought to watch next, have not come. In a modern army it would of\ncourse be the duty of the new watch to come and relieve the old; in an\nancient barbaric army--characteristically--the old watch had to go and\nwake the new. You could not, one must suppose, trust them to take their\nturn otherwise. At the end of the first strophe a Guard suggests that\nthey should rouse the Lycians; at the end of the second the Leader\ndefinitely gives the word to do so. The Guards go, and so the stage (and\norchestra) is left empty.\n\nThis is plain enough; but why were the Guards brought away from their\noriginal position--from the orchestra to the stage? Probably to allow\nthe Greek spies to pass on towards the Thracian camp by a different and\nunoccupied way, not by the way which the Guards had just taken.\n\nThe story of the Nightingale is well known: she was Philom\u00c3\u00aala, or in the\nolder story Procn\u00c3\u00aa, an Athenian princess, wedded to the faithless\nThracian king, T\u00c3\u00aareus. In a fury of vengeance on her husband she slew\ntheir only son, Itys or Itylus, and now laments him broken-hearted for\never.\n\nP. 31, l. 567 ff., Odysseus and Diomedes.]--Observe how we are left\ngradually to discover that they have met and killed Dolon. They enter\ncarrying, as far as we can make out, a wolf-skin that looks like his:\nthey had evidently spoken to him, ll. 572, 575: it _is_ his and they\nhave killed him--l. 592 f.\n\nAll the Odysseus-Diomedes scenes have something unusual about them,\nsomething daring, turbulent, and perhaps lacking in dramatic tact. The\nsilent rush on Hector's empty tent is hard to parallel. The cruel Athena\nis Euripidean; but her appearance in the midst of the action is\nstartling, though it may be paralleled from Sophocles' Ajax. In\nEuripides Gods are generally kept for the prologue or epilogue, away\nfrom the ordinary action. (The vision of Iris and Lyssa in the middle of\nthe Heracles has at least the stage clear of mortals and the Chorus\napparently in a kind of dream.) Again the conception of Athena\npretending to be Cypris is curious. The disguised Athena is common in\nthe Odyssey, but she does not disguise herself as another goddess. (It\nis sometimes held that this scene requires four actors, which would be a\ndecisive mark of lateness; but this is not really so. The actor who took\nOdysseus could easily get round in time to take Paris also--especially\nif he made his exit at l. 626, before Athena sees Paris. And the Greek\nstage had no objection to such doubling.) Lastly, the scene of turmoil\nbetween the spies and the Guards is extraordinary in a tragedy, though\nit would suit well in a pro-satyric play. See Introduction.\n\nP. 33, l. 594, Stage direction.]--They bear Dolon's \"spoils\" or\n\"tokens\": probably his wolf-skin. If they bring it with them they must\nprobably do something with it, and to hang it where it may give Hector a\nviolent start seems the natural proceeding. Also, they can hardly be\ncarrying it in the scene with the Guards, l. 675 ff., p. 38 f. That\nwould be madness. They must have got rid of it before then, and this\nseems the obvious place for doing so.\n\nP. 36, ll. 637 ff., Athena as Cypris.]--It is not clear how this would\nbe represented on the Greek stage, though there is no reason to think\nthere would be any special difficulty. On a modern stage it could be\nworked as follows:--The Goddess will be behind a gauze, so that she is\ninvisible when only the lights in front of the gauze are lit, but\nvisible when a light goes up behind it. She will first appear with\nhelmet and spear in some hard light; then disappear and be rediscovered\nin the same place in a softer light, the helmet and spear gone and some\nemblems of Cypris--say a flower and a dove--in their place. Of course\nthe voice will change too.\n\nThe next scene, where the two spies are caught and let go, is clear\nenough in its general structure; the details must remain conjectural.\n\nP. 40, l. 703, What the High God.]--It would be unparalleled in\nclassical Greek to describe a man by his religion; but this phrase seems\nonly to mean: \"What is his tribal God?\" _i.e._ what is his tribe? Thus\nit could be said of Isagoras in Herodotus (v. 66) that his kinsmen\nsacrificed to Carian Zeus, suggesting, presumably, that he had Carian\nblood.\n\nP. 42, l. 728, Voice of the wounded man outside.]--The puzzled and\ndiscouraged talk of the Guards round the fire, the groaning in the\ndarkness without, the quick alarm among the men who had been careless\nbefore, and the slow realisation of disaster that follows--all these\nseem to me to be wonderfully indicated, though the severe poetic\nconvention excludes any approach to what we, by modern prose standards,\nwould call effective realism.\n\nP. 44, ll. 756-803. This fine vivid speech has something of the famous\nEuripidean Messenger-Speeches in it; though they are apt to be much\nlonger and also are practically never spoken by a principal in the\naction, always by a subordinate or an onlooker. Cf. the speech of the\nMessenger-Shepherd above, p. 17 f. An extreme sharpness of articulation\nis characteristic of Euripides' later work: each speech, each scene,\neach effect is isolated and made complete in itself. The Messenger\nprepares his message, relates his message and goes, not mixing himself\nup in the further fortunes of the drama. But this extreme pursuit of\nlucidity and clear outlines is not nearly so marked in the early plays:\nin the _Cyclops_ the Messenger's speech is actually spoken by Odysseus,\nll. 382-436, and the Serving Man and Serving Maid in the _Alcestis_ are\nnot mere abstract Messengers.\n\nP. 46, ll. 810-830, Hector and the Guard.]--There is intentional colour\nhere--the impulsive half-barbaric rage of Hector, the oriental\ngrovelling of the Guard, and of course the quick return to courteous\nself-mastery with which Hector receives the taunts of the wounded man.\n\nP. 46, l. 819. The Guard seems to think that the spies got past him when\nhe came to Hector's tent at the beginning of the play. It was really\nlater, when he made his men leave their post to wake the Lycians.\nPerhaps he is lying.\n\nP. 48, l. 876, Justice knows.]--It is a clever touch to leave the\nThracian still only half-convinced and grumbling.\n\nP. 49, l. 882, Appearance of the Muse.]--A beautiful scene. It has been\nthought to come abruptly and, as it were, unskilfully on top of the\nfamiliar dialogue between Hector and the Thracian. But the movements,\nfirst of soldiers lifting and carrying the wounded man, and then of\nmessengers taking word to Priam for burial of the men slain, make the\ntransition much easier.\n\nP. 50, l. 895 ff. and l. 906 ff., A dirge of the Thracian\nmountains.]--Such dirges must have struck the Greeks as the fragments of\nOssian struck the Lowlanders among us. I have found that the dirge here\ngoes naturally into a sort of Ossianic rhythm.\n\nP. 51, l. 915. The speech of the Muse seems like the writing of a poet\nwho is, for the moment, tired of mere drama, and wishes to get back into\nhis own element. Such passages are characteristic of Euripides.--The\ndeath of Rhesus seems to the Muse like an act of vengeance from the dead\nThamyris, the Thracian bard who had blasphemed the Muses and challenged\nthem to a contest of song. They conquered him and left him blind, but\nstill a poet. The story in Homer is more terrible, though more\ncivilised: \"They in wrath made him a maimed man, they took away his\nheavenly song and made him forget his harping.\"\n\nThamyris, the bard who defied Heaven; Orpheus, the bard, saint, lover,\nwhose severed head still cried for his lost Eurydice; Musaeus, the bard\nof mystic wisdom and initiations--are the three great legendary figures\nof this Northern mountain minstrelsy.\n\nP. 52, l. 950. These short speeches between Hector and the Leader of the\nGuard make a jarring note in the midst of the Muse's lament. Perhaps it\nwould not be so if we knew how the play was produced, but at present\nthis seems like one of several marks of comparative crudity in technique\nwhich mark the play, amid all its daring and inventiveness.\n\nP. 52, l. 962 ff., My son shall not be laid in any grave.]--Like other\nNorthern barbaric princes, such as Orpheus (l. 972 below) and Zalmoxis\n(Herodotus, iv. 95) and Holgar the Dane, Rhesus lies in a hidden chamber\nbeneath the earth, watching, apparently, for the day of uttermost need\nwhen he must rise to help his people. There is no other passage in Greek\ntragedy where such a fate is attributed to a hero, though the position\nof Darius in the _Persae_ and Agamemnon in the _Choephori_ or the\n_Electra_ is in some ways analogous.\n\nThe last lines of the Muse have a very Euripidean ring: cf. _Medea_, l.\n1090 (p. 61, \"My thoughts have roamed a cloudy land\"), _Alcestis_, l.\n882.\n\nP. 54, ll. 983-end. This curious and moving end--not in death or peace\nbut in a girding of tired men to greater toil--reminds one of the last\nwords of _The Trojan Women_: \"Forth to the long Greek ships And the\nsea's foaming,\" and the last words of the _Chanson de Roland_ there\nquoted.\n\nThe Trojans evidently go forth under the shadow of disaster, though with\nfirmness and courage. The stage direction is of course purely\nconjectural. If Diomedes left some sign of Dolon's death for Hector to\nsee, as he probably must have done, then Hector must at some time or\nother see it. If so, this seems to be the place.\n\n\n                            THE END\n\n\nPrinted by Ballantyne, Hanson & Co.\nEdinburgh & London\n\n\n\n\n_BY THE SAME AUTHOR_\n\n\nPUBLISHED BY WILLIAM HEINEMANN\n\nHISTORY OF ANCIENT GREEK LITERATURE. 1897. 6s.\n\nCARLYON SAHIB: A Play. 1899. 1s. 6d.\n\nANDROMACHE: A Play. 1900. 1s. 6d.\n\n\nPublished by the Clarendon Press\n\nEURIPIDIS FABULAE: Brevi Adnotatione Critica Instructae, Vols.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp:\/\/pglaf.org\/fundraising.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":719,"split":"train"}
