{"ori_id":"5ed5c13f17141e243fab9c10c511f2e19333c52e","title":"Illusions perdues","context":"Illusions perdues\n Lucien Chardon, the son of a lower middle-class father and an impoverished mother of remote aristocratic descent, is the pivotal figure of the entire work. Living at Angoul\u00eame, he is impoverished, impatient, handsome and ambitious. His widowed mother, his sister \u00c8ve and his best friend, David S\u00e9chard, do nothing to lessen his high opinion of his own talents, for it is an opinion they share.\nEven as Part I of Illusions perdues, Les Deux po\u00e8tes (The Two Poets), begins, Lucien has already written a historical novel and a sonnet sequence, whereas David is a scientist. But both, according to Balzac, are \"poets\" in that they creatively seek truth. Theirs is a fraternity of poetic aspiration, whether as scientist or writer: thus, even before David marries \u00c8ve, the two young men are spiritual brothers.\nLucien is introduced into the drawing-room of the leading figure of Angoul\u00eame high society, Mme de Bargeton, who rapidly becomes infatuated with him. It is not long before the pair flee to Paris where Lucien adopts his maternal patronymic of de Rubempr\u00e9 and hopes to make his mark as a poet. Mme de Bargeton, on the other hand, recognises her m\u00e9salliance and, though remaining in Paris, severs all ties with Lucien, abandoning him to a life of destitution.\nIn Part II, Un Grand homme de province \u00e0 Paris, Lucien is contrasted both with the journalist Lousteau and the high-minded writer Daniel d\u2019Arthez. Jilted by Mme de Bargeton for the adventurer Sixte du Ch\u00e2telet, he moves in a social circle of high-class actress-prostitutes and their journalist lovers: soon he becomes the lover of Coralie. As a literary journalist he prostitutes his talent. But he still harbours the ambition of belonging to high society and longs to assume by royal warrant the surname and coat of arms of the de Rubempr\u00e9s. He therefore switches his allegiance from the liberal opposition press to the one or two royalist newspapers that support the government. This act of betrayal earns him the implacable hatred of his erstwhile journalist colleagues, who destroy Coralie\u2019s theatrical reputation. In the depths of his despair he forges his brother-in-law\u2019s name on three promissory notes. This is his ultimate betrayal of his integrity as a person. After Coralie\u2019s death he returns in disgrace to Angoul\u00eame, stowed away behind the Ch\u00e2telets\u2019 carriage: Mme de Bargeton has just married du Ch\u00e2telet, who has been appointed prefect of that region.\nMeanwhile, at Angoul\u00eame David S\u00e9chard is betrayed on all sides but is supported by his loving wife. He invents a new and cheaper method of paper production: thus, at a thematic level, the commercialization of paper-manufacturing processes is very closely interwoven with the commercialization of literature. Lucien\u2019s forgery of his brother-in-law\u2019s signature almost bankrupts David, who has to sell the secret of his invention to business rivals. Lucien is about to commit suicide when he is approached by a sham Jesuit priest, the Abb\u00e9 Carlos Herrera: this, in another guise, is the escaped convict Vautrin whom Balzac had already presented in Le P\u00e8re Goriot. Herrera takes Lucien under his protection and they drive off to Paris, there to begin a fresh assault on the capital.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of Lost Illusions, by Honore De Balzac\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

It\nis hardly possible to exaggerate the gain in distinctness and lucidity\nof arrangement derived from putting _Les Deux Poetes_ and _Eve et\nDavid_ (a much better title than that which has been preferred in the\n_Edition Definitive_) together in one volume, and reserving the\ngreatness and decadence of Lucien de Rubempre for another. It is\ndistinctly awkward that this should be divided, as it is itself an\nenormous episode, a sort of Herodotean parenthesis, rather than an\nintegral part of the story. And, as a matter of fact, it joins on much\nmore to the _Splendeurs et Miseres des Courtisanes_ than to its actual\ncompanions. In fact, it is an instance of the somewhat haphazard and\narbitrary way in which the actual division of the _Comedie_ has\nworked, that it should, dealing as it does wholly and solely with\nParisian life, be put in the _Scenes de la Vie de Province_, and\nshould be separated from its natural conclusion not merely as a matter\nof volumes, but as a matter of divisions. In making the arrangement,\nhowever, it is necessary to remember Balzac's own scheme, especially\nas the connection of the three parts in other ways is too close to\npermit the wrenching of them asunder altogether and finally. This\ncaution given, all that is necessary can be done by devoting the first\npart of the introduction entirely to the first and third or Angouleme\nparts, and by consecrating the latter part to the egregious Lucien by\nhimself.\n\nThere is a double gain in doing this, for, independently of the\nconnection as above referred to, Lucien has little to do except as an\nopportunity for the display of virtue by his sister and David Sechard;\nand the parts in which they appear are among the most interesting of\nBalzac's work. The \"Idyllic\" charm of this marriage for love, combined\nas it is with exhibitions of the author's power in more than one of\nthe ways in which he loved best to show it, has never escaped\nattention from Balzac's most competent critics. He himself had\nspeculated in print and paper before David Sechard was conceived; he\nhimself had for all \"maniacs,\" all men of one idea, the fraternal\nenthusiasm of a fellow-victim. He could never touch a miser without a\nsort of shudder of interest; and that singular fancy of his for\ndescribing complicated legal and commercial undertakings came in too.\nNor did he spare, in this wide-ranging book, to bring in other\nfavorite matters of his, the _hobereau_--or squireen--aristocracy, the\ntittle-tattle of the country town and so forth.\n\nThe result is a book of multifarious interest, not hampered, as some\nof its fellows are, by an uncertainty on the author's part as to what\nparticular hare he is coursing. Part of the interest, after the\ndescription of the printing office and of old Sechard's swindling of\nhis son, is a doubling, it is true, upon that of _La muse du\nDepartement_, and is perhaps a little less amusingly done; but it is\nblended with better matters. Sixte du Chatelet is a considerable\naddition to Balzac's gallery of the aristocracy in transition--of the\nBonaparte _parvenus_ whom perhaps he understood even better than the\nold nobility, for they were already in his time becoming adulterated\nand alloyed; or than the new folk of business and finance, for they\nwere but in their earliest stages. Nor is the rest of the society of\nMadame de Bargeton inferior.\n\nBut the real interest both of _Les Deux Poetes_, and still more of\n_Eve et David_, between which two, be it always remembered, comes in\nthe _Distinguished Provincial_, lies in the characters who gave their\nname to the last part. In David, the man of one idea, who yet has room\nfor an honest love and an all-deserved friendship, Balzac could not go\nwrong. David Sechard takes a place by himself among the sheep of the\n_Comedie_. Some may indeed say that this phrase is unfortunate, that\nBalzac's sheep have more qualities of the mutton than innocence. It is\nnot quite to be denied. But David is very far indeed from being a good\nimbecile, like Cesar Birotteau, or a man intoxicated out of\ncommon-sense by a passion respectable in itself, like Goriot. His\nsacrifice of his mania in time is something--nay, it is very much; and\nhis disinterested devotion to his brother-in-law does not quite pass\nthe limits of sense.\n\nBut what shall we say of Eve? She is good of course, good as gold, as\nEugenie Grandet herself; and the novelist has been kind enough to\nallow her to be happier. But has he quite interested us in her love\nfor David? Has he even persuaded us that the love existed in a form\ndeserving the name? Did not Eve rather take her husband to protect\nhim, to look after him, than either to love, honor, and obey in the\northodox sense, or to love for love's sake only, as some still take\ntheir husbands and wives even at the end of the nineteenth century?\nThis is a question which each reader must answer for himself; but few\nare likely to refuse assent to the sentence, \"Happy the husband who\nhas such a wife as Eve Chardon!\"\n\nThe central part of _Illusions Perdues_, which in reason stands by\nitself, and may do so ostensibly with considerably less than the\nintroduction explanatory which Balzac often gives to his own books, is\none of the most carefully worked out and diversely important of his\nnovels. It should, of course, be read before _Splendeurs et Miseres\ndes Courtisanes_, which is avowedly its second part, a small piece of\n_Eve et David_ serving as the link between them. But it is almost\nsufficient by and to itself. _Lucien de Rubempre ou le Journalisme_\nwould be the most straightforward and descriptive title for it, and\none which Balzac in some of his moods would have been content enough\nto use.\n\nThe story of it is too continuous and interesting to need elaborate\nargument, for nobody is likely to miss any important link in it. But\nBalzac has nowhere excelled in finesse and success of analysis, the\ndouble disillusion which introduces itself at once between Madame de\nBargeton and Lucien, and which makes any _redintegratio amoris_ of a\nvalid kind impossible, because each cannot but be aware that the other\nhas anticipated the rupture. It will not, perhaps, be a matter of such\ngeneral agreement whether he has or has not exceeded the fair license\nof the novelist in attributing to Lucien those charms of body and\ngifts of mind which make him, till his moral weakness and\nworthlessness are exposed, irresistible, and enable him for a time to\nrepair his faults by a sort of fairy good-luck. The sonnets of _Les\nMarguerites_, which were given to the author by poetical friends\n--Gautier, it is said, supplied the \"Tulip\"--are undoubtedly good and\nsufficient. But Lucien's first article, which is (according to a\npractice the rashness of which cannot be too much deprecated) given\nlikewise, is certainly not very wonderful; and the Paris press must\nhave been rather at a low ebb if it made any sensation. As we are not\nfavored with any actual portrait of Lucien, detection is less possible\nhere, but the novelist has perhaps a very little abused the privilege\nof making a hero, \"Like Paris handsome, and like Hector brave,\" or\nrather \"Like Paris handsome, and like Phoebus clever.\" There is no\ndoubt, however, that the interest of the book lies partly in the vivid\nand severe picture of journalism given in it, and partly in the way in\nwhich the character of Lucien is adjusted to show up that of the\nabstract journalist still farther.\n\nHow far is the picture true? It must be said, in fairness to Balzac,\nthat a good many persons of some competence in France have pronounced\nfor its truth there; and if that be so, all one can say is, \"So much\nthe worse for French journalists.\" It is also certain that a lesser,\nbut still not inconsiderable number of persons in England--generally\npersons who, not perhaps with Balzac's genius, have like Balzac\npublished books, and are not satisfied with their reception by the\npress--agree more or less as to England. For myself, I can only say\nthat I do not believe things have ever been quite so bad in England,\nand that I am quite sure there never has been any need for them to be.\nThere are, no doubt, spiteful, unprincipled, incompetent practitioners\nof journalism as of everything else; and it is of course obvious that\nwhile advertisements, the favor of the chiefs of parties, and so\nforth, are temptations to newspaper managers not to hold up a very\nhigh standard of honor, anonymity affords to newspaper writers a\ndangerously easy shield to cover malice or dishonesty. But I can only\nsay that during long practice in every kind of political and literary\njournalism, I never was seriously asked to write anything I did not\nthink, and never had the slightest difficulty in confining myself to\nwhat I did think.\n\nIn fact Balzac, like a good many other men of letters who abuse\njournalism, put himself very much out of court by continually\npractising it, not merely during his struggling period, but long after\nhe had made his name, indeed almost to the very last. And it is very\nhard to resist the conclusion that when he charged journalism\ngenerally not merely with envy, hatred, malice, and all\nuncharitableness, but with hopeless and pervading dishonesty, he had\nlittle more ground for it than an inability to conceive how any one,\nexcept from vile reasons of this kind, could fail to praise Honore de\nBalzac.\n\nAt any rate, either his art by itself, or his art assisted and\nstrengthened by that personal feeling which, as we have seen counted\nfor much with him, has here produced a wonderfully vivid piece of\nfiction--one, I think, inferior in success to hardly anything he\nhas done. Whether, as at a late period a very well-informed,\nwell-affected, and well-equipped critic hinted, his picture of the\nLuciens and the Lousteaus did not a little to propagate both is\nanother matter. The seriousness with which Balzac took the accusation\nperhaps shows a little sense of galling. But putting this aside, _Un\nGrand Homme de Province a Paris_ must be ranked, both for comedy and\ntragedy, both for scheme and execution, in the first rank of his work.\n\nThe bibliography of this long and curious book--almost the only one\nwhich contains some verse, some of Balzac's own, some given to him by\nhis more poetical friends--occupies full ten pages of M. de\nLovenjoul's record. The first part, which bore the general title, was\na book from the beginning, and appeared in 1837 in the _Scenes de la\nVie de Province_. It had five chapters, and the original verse it\ncontained had appeared in the _Annalaes Romantiques_ ten years earlier\nwith slight variants. The second part, _Un Grand Homme de Province_,\nlikewise appeared as a book, independently published by Souverain in\n1839 in two volumes and forty chapters. But two of these chapters had\nbeen inserted a few days before the publications in the _Estafette_.\nHere Canalis was more distinctly identified with Lamartine than in the\nsubsequent texts. The third part, unlike its forerunners, appeared\nserially in two papers, _L'Etat_ and _Le Parisien_, in the year 1843,\nunder the title of _David Sechard, ou les Souffrances d'un Inventeur_,\nand next year became a book under the first title only. But before\nthis last issue it had been united to the other two parts, and had\nappeared as _Eve et David_ in the first edition of the _Comedie.\n\n     George Saintsbury\n\n\n\n                                 I\n\n\n\n                              TWO POETS\n                       (Lost Illusions Part I)\n\n                                  BY\n\n                           HONORE DE BALZAC\n\n\n\n                            Translated By\n                            Ellen Marriage\n\n\n\n                              DEDICATION\n\n  To Monsieur Victor Hugo,\n\n  It was your birthright to be, like a Rafael or a Pitt, a great\n  poet at an age when other men are children; it was your fate, the\n  fate of Chateaubriand and of every man of genius, to struggle\n  against jealousy skulking behind the columns of a newspaper, or\n  crouching in the subterranean places of journalism. For this\n  reason I desired that your victorious name should help to win a\n  victory for this work that I inscribe to you, a work which, if\n  some persons are to be believed, is an act of courage as well as a\n  veracious history. If there had been journalists in the time of\n  Moliere, who can doubt but that they, like marquises, financiers,\n  doctors, and lawyers, would have been within the province of the\n  writer of plays? And why should Comedy, _qui castigat ridendo\n  mores_, make an exception in favor of one power, when the Parisian\n  press spares none? I am happy, monsieur, in this opportunity of\n  subscribing myself your sincere admirer and friend,\n\nDE BALZAC.\n\n\n\n\n                              TWO POETS\n\n\n\nAt the time when this story opens, the Stanhope press and the\nink-distributing roller were not as yet in general use in small\nprovincial printing establishments. Even at Angouleme, so closely\nconnected through its paper-mills with the art of typography in Paris,\nthe only machinery in use was the primitive wooden invention to which\nthe language owes a figure of speech--\"the press groans\" was no mere\nrhetorical expression in those days. Leather ink-balls were still used\nin old-fashioned printing houses; the pressman dabbed the ink by hand\non the characters, and the movable table on which the form of type was\nplaced in readiness for the sheet of paper, being made of marble,\nliterally deserved its name of \"impression-stone.\" Modern machinery\nhas swept all this old-world mechanism into oblivion; the wooden press\nwhich, with all its imperfections, turned out such beautiful work for\nthe Elzevirs, Plantin, Aldus, and Didot is so completely forgotten,\nthat something must be said as to the obsolete gear on which\nJerome-Nicolas Sechard set an almost superstitious affection, for it\nplays a part in this chronicle of great small things.\n\nSechard had been in his time a journeyman pressman, a \"bear\" in\ncompositors' slang. The continued pacing to and fro of the pressman\nfrom ink-table to press, from press to ink-table, no doubt suggested\nthe nickname. The \"bears,\" however, make matters even by calling the\ncompositors monkeys, on account of the nimble industry displayed by\nthose gentlemen in picking out the type from the hundred and fifty-two\ncompartments of the cases.\n\nIn the disastrous year 1793, Sechard, being fifty years old and a\nmarried man, escaped the great Requisition which swept the bulk of\nFrench workmen into the army. The old pressman was the only hand left\nin the printing-house; and when the master (otherwise the \"gaffer\")\ndied, leaving a widow, but no children, the business seemed to be on\nthe verge of extinction; for the solitary \"bear\" was quite incapable\nof the feat of transformation into a \"monkey,\" and in his quality of\npressman had never learned to read or write. Just then, however, a\nRepresentative of the People being in a mighty hurry to publish the\nDecrees of the Convention, bestowed a master printer's license on\nSechard, and requisitioned the establishment. Citizen Sechard accepted\nthe dangerous patent, bought the business of his master's widow with\nhis wife's savings, and took over the plant at half its value. But he\nwas not even at the beginning. He was bound to print the Decrees of\nthe Republic without mistakes and without delay.\n\nIn this strait Jerome-Nicolas Sechard had the luck to discover a noble\nMarseillais who had no mind to emigrate and lose his lands, nor yet to\nshow himself openly and lose his head, and consequently was fain to\nearn a living by some lawful industry. A bargain was struck. M. le\nComte de Maucombe, disguised in a provincial printer's jacket, set up,\nread, and corrected the decrees which forbade citizens to harbor\naristocrats under pain of death; while the \"bear,\" now a \"gaffer,\"\nprinted the copies and duly posted them, and the pair remained safe\nand sound.\n\nIn 1795, when the squall of the Terror had passed over, Nicolas\nSechard was obliged to look out for another jack-of-all-trades to be\ncompositor, reader, and foreman in one; and an Abbe who declined the\noath succeeded the Comte de Maucombe as soon as the First Consul\nrestored public worship. The Abbe became a Bishop at the Restoration,\nand in after days the Count and the Abbe met and sat together on the\nsame bench of the House of Peers.\n\nIn 1795 Jerome-Nicolas had not known how to read or write; in 1802 he\nhad made no progress in either art; but by allowing a handsome margin\nfor \"wear and tear\" in his estimates, he managed to pay a foreman's\nwages. The once easy-going journeyman was a terror to his \"bears\" and\n\"monkeys.\" Where poverty ceases, avarice begins. From the day when\nSechard first caught a glimpse of the possibility of making a fortune,\na growing covetousness developed and sharpened in him a certain\npractical faculty for business--greedy, suspicious, and keen-eyed. He\ncarried on his craft in disdain of theory. In course of time he had\nlearned to estimate at a glance the cost of printing per page or per\nsheet in every kind of type. He proved to unlettered customers that\nlarge type costs more to move; or, if small type was under discussion,\nthat it was more difficult to handle. The setting-up of the type was\nthe one part of his craft of which he knew nothing; and so great was\nhis terror lest he should not charge enough, that he always made a\nheavy profit. He never took his eyes off his compositors while they\nwere paid by the hour. If he knew that a paper manufacturer was in\ndifficulties, he would buy up his stock at a cheap rate and warehouse\nthe paper. So from this time forward he was his own landlord, and\nowned the old house which had been a printing office from time\nimmemorial.\n\nHe had every sort of luck. He was left a widower with but one son. The\nboy he sent to the grammar school; he must be educated, not so much\nfor his own sake as to train a successor to the business; and Sechard\ntreated the lad harshly so as to prolong the time of parental rule,\nmaking him work at case on holidays, telling him that he must learn to\nearn his own living, so as to recompense his poor old father, who was\nslaving his life out to give him an education.\n\nThen the Abbe went, and Sechard promoted one of his four compositors\nto be foreman, making his choice on the future bishop's recommendation\nof the man as an honest and intelligent workman. In these ways the\nworthy printer thought to tide over the time until his son could take\na business which was sure to extend in young and clever hands.\n\nDavid Sechard's school career was a brilliant one. Old Sechard, as a\n\"bear\" who had succeeded in life without any education, entertained a\nvery considerable contempt for attainments in book learning; and when\nhe sent his son to Paris to study the higher branches of typography,\nhe recommended the lad so earnestly to save a good round sum in the\n\"working man's paradise\" (as he was pleased to call the city), and so\ndistinctly gave the boy to understand that he was not to draw upon the\npaternal purse, that it seemed as if old Sechard saw some way of\ngaining private ends of his own by that sojourn in the Land of\nSapience. So David learned his trade, and completed his education at\nthe same time, and Didot's foreman became a scholar; and yet when he\nleft Paris at the end of 1819, summoned home by his father to take the\nhelm of business, he had not cost his parent a farthing.\n\nNow Nicolas Sechard's establishment hitherto had enjoyed a monopoly of\nall the official printing in the department, besides the work of the\nprefecture and the diocese--three connections which should prove\nmighty profitable to an active young printer; but precisely at this\njuncture the firm of Cointet Brothers, paper manufacturers, applied to\nthe authorities for the second printer's license in Angouleme.\nHitherto old Sechard had contrived to reduce this license to a dead\nletter, thanks to the war crisis of the Empire, and consequent atrophy\nof commercial enterprise; but he had neglected to buy up the right\nhimself, and this piece of parsimony was the ruin of the old business.\nSechard thought joyfully when he heard the news that the coming\nstruggle with the Cointets would be fought out by his son and not by\nhimself.\n\n\"I should have gone to the wall,\" he thought, \"but a young fellow from\nthe Didots will pull through.\"\n\nThe septuagenarian sighed for the time when he could live at ease in\nhis own fashion. If his knowledge of the higher branches of the craft\nof printing was scanty, on the other hand, he was supposed to be past\nmaster of an art which workmen pleasantly call \"tipple-ography,\" an\nart held in high esteem by the divine author of _Pantagruel_; though of\nlate, by reason of the persecution of societies yclept of Temperance,\nthe cult has fallen, day by day, into disuse.\n\nJerome-Nicolas Sechard, bound by the laws of etymology to be a dry\nsubject, suffered from an inextinguishable thirst. His wife, during\nher lifetime, managed to control within reasonable bounds the passion\nfor the juice of the grape, a taste so natural to the bear that M. de\nChateaubriand remarked it among the ursine tribes of the New World.\nBut philosophers inform us that old age is apt to revert to the habits\nof youth, and Sechard senior is a case in point--the older he grew,\nthe better he loved to drink. The master-passion had given a stamp of\noriginality to an ursine physiognomy; his nose had developed till it\nreached the proportions of a double great-canon A; his veined cheeks\nlooked like vine-leaves, covered, as they were, with bloated patches\nof purple, madder red, and often mottled hues; till altogether, the\ncountenance suggested a huge truffle clasped about by autumn vine\ntendrils. The little gray eyes, peering out from beneath thick\neyebrows like bushes covered with snow, were agleam with the cunning\nof avarice that had extinguished everything else in the man, down to\nthe very instinct of fatherhood. Those eyes never lost their cunning\neven when disguised in drink. Sechard put you in mind of one of La\nFontaine's Franciscan friars, with the fringe of grizzled hair still\ncurling about his bald pate. He was short and corpulent, like one of\nthe old-fashioned lamps for illumination, that burn a vast deal of oil\nto a very small piece of wick; for excess of any sort confirms the\nhabit of body, and drunkenness, like much study, makes the fat man\nstouter, and the lean man leaner still.\n\nFor thirty years Jerome-Nicolas-Sechard had worn the famous municipal\nthree-cornered hat, which you may still see here and there on the head\nof the towncrier in out-of-the-way places. His breeches and waistcoat\nwere of greenish velveteen, and he wore an old-fashioned brown\ngreatcoat, gray cotton stockings, and shoes with silver buckles to\nthem. This costume, in which the workman shone through the burgess,\nwas so thoroughly in keeping with the man's character, defects, and\nway of life, that he might have come ready dressed into the world. You\ncould no more imagine him apart from his clothes than you could think\nof a bulb without its husk. If the old printer had not long since\ngiven the measure of his blind greed, the very nature of the man came\nout in the manner of his abdication.\n\nKnowing, as he did, that his son must have learned his business pretty\nthoroughly in the great school of the Didots, he had yet been\nruminating for a long while over the bargain that he meant to drive\nwith David. All that the father made, the son, of course, was bound to\nlose, but in business this worthy knew nothing of father or son. If,\nin the first instance, he had looked on David as his only child, later\nhe came to regard him as the natural purchaser of the business, whose\ninterests were therefore his own. Sechard meant to sell dear; David,\nof course, to buy cheap; his son, therefore, was an antagonist, and it\nwas his duty to get the better of him. The transformation of sentiment\ninto self-seeking, ordinarily slow, tortuous, and veiled by hypocrisy\nin better educated people, was swift and direct in the old \"bear,\" who\ndemonstrated the superiority of shrewd tipple-ography over\nbook-learned typography.\n\nDavid came home, and the old man received him with all the cordiality\nwhich cunning folk can assume with an eye to business. He was as full\nof thought for him as any lover for his mistress; giving him his arm,\ntelling him where to put his foot down so as to avoid the mud, warming\nthe bed for him, lighting a fire in his room, making his supper ready.\nThe next day, after he had done his best to fluster his son's wits\nover a sumptuous dinner, Jerome-Nicolas Sechard, after copious\npotations, began with a \"Now for business,\" a remark so singularly\nmisplaced between two hiccoughs, that David begged his parent to\npostpone serious matters until the morrow. But the old \"bear\" was by\nno means inclined to put off the long-expected battle; he was too well\nprepared to turn his tipsiness to good account. He had dragged the\nchain these fifty years, he would not wear it another hour; to-morrow\nhis son should be the \"gaffer.\"\n\nPerhaps a word or two about the business premises may be said here.\nThe printing-house had been established since the reign of Louis XIV.\nin the angle made by the Rue de Beaulieu and the Place du Murier; it\nhad been devoted to its present purposes for a long time past. The\nground floor consisted of a single huge room lighted on the side next\nthe street by an old-fashioned casement, and by a large sash window\nthat gave upon the yard at the back. A passage at the side led to the\nprivate office; but in the provinces the processes of typography\nexcite such a lively interest, that customers usually preferred to\nenter by way of the glass door in the street front, though they at\nonce descended three steps, for the floor of the workshop lay below\nthe level of the street. The gaping newcomer always failed to note the\nperils of the passage through the shop; and while staring at the\nsheets of paper strung in groves across the ceiling, ran against the\nrows of cases, or knocked his hat against the tie-bars that secured\nthe presses in position. Or the customer's eyes would follow the agile\nmovements of a compositor, picking out type from the hundred and\nfifty-two compartments of his case, reading his copy, verifying the\nwords in the composing-stick, and leading the lines, till a ream of\ndamp paper weighted with heavy slabs, and set down in the middle of\nthe gangway, tripped up the bemused spectator, or he caught his hip\nagainst the angle of a bench, to the huge delight of boys, \"bears,\"\nand \"monkeys.\" No wight had ever been known to reach the further end\nwithout accident. A couple of glass-windowed cages had been built out\ninto the yard at the back; the foreman sat in state in the one, the\nmaster printer in the other. Out in the yard the walls were agreeably\ndecorated by trellised vines, a tempting bit of color, considering the\nowner's reputation. On the one side of the space stood the kitchen, on\nthe other the woodshed, and in a ramshackle penthouse against the hall\nat the back, the paper was trimmed and damped down. Here, too, the\nforms, or, in ordinary language, the masses of set-up type, were\nwashed. Inky streams issuing thence blended with the ooze from the\nkitchen sink, and found their way into the kennel in the street\noutside; till peasants coming into the town of a market day believed\nthat the Devil was taking a wash inside the establishment.\n\nAs to the house above the printing office, it consisted of three rooms\non the first floor and a couple of attics in the roof. The first room\ndid duty as dining-room and lobby; it was exactly the same length as\nthe passage below, less the space taken up by the old-fashioned wooden\nstaircase; and was lighted by a narrow casement on the street and a\nbull's-eye window looking into the yard. The chief characteristic of\nthe apartment was a cynic simplicity, due to money-making greed. The\nbare walls were covered with plain whitewash, the dirty brick floor\nhad never been scoured, the furniture consisted of three rickety\nchairs, a round table, and a sideboard stationed between the two doors\nof a bedroom and a sitting-room. Windows and doors alike were dingy\nwith accumulated grime. Reams of blank paper or printed matter usually\nencumbered the floor, and more frequently than not the remains of\nSechard's dinner, empty bottles and plates, were lying about on the\npackages.\n\nThe bedroom was lighted on the side of the yard by a window with\nleaded panes, and hung with the old-world tapestry that decorated\nhouse fronts in provincial towns on Corpus Christi Day. For furniture\nit boasted a vast four-post bedstead with canopy, valances and quilt\nof crimson serge, a couple of worm-eaten armchairs, two\ntapestry-covered chairs in walnut wood, an aged bureau, and a timepiece\non the mantel-shelf. The Seigneur Rouzeau, Jerome-Nicolas' master and\npredecessor, had furnished the homely old-world room; it was just as\nhe had left it.\n\nThe sitting-room had been partly modernized by the late Mme. Sechard;\nthe walls were adorned with a wainscot, fearful to behold, painted\nthe color of powder blue. The panels were decorated with wall-paper\n--Oriental scenes in sepia tint--and for all furniture, half-a-dozen\nchairs with lyre-shaped backs and blue leather cushions were ranged\nround the room. The two clumsy arched windows that gave upon the Place\ndu Murier were curtainless; there was neither clock nor candle sconce\nnor mirror above the mantel-shelf, for Mme. Sechard had died before\nshe carried out her scheme of decoration; and the \"bear,\" unable to\nconceive the use of improvements that brought in no return in money,\nhad left it at this point.\n\nHither, _pede titubante_, Jerome-Nicolas Sechard brought his son, and\npointed to a sheet of paper lying on the table--a valuation of plant\ndrawn up by the foreman under his direction.\n\n\"Read that, my boy,\" said Jerome-Nicolas, rolling a drunken eye from\nthe paper to his son, and back to the paper. \"You will see what a\njewel of a printing-house I am giving you.\"\n\n\"'Three wooden presses, held in position by iron tie-bars, cast-iron\nplates----'\"\n\n\"An improvement of my own,\" put in Sechard senior.\n\n\"'----Together with all the implements, ink-tables, balls, benches,\net cetera, sixteen hundred francs!' Why, father,\" cried David, letting\nthe sheet fall, \"these presses of yours are old sabots not worth a\nhundred crowns; they are only fit for firewood.\"\n\n\"Sabots?\" cried old Sechard, \"_Sabots_? There, take the inventory and\nlet us go downstairs. You will soon see whether your paltry iron-work\ncontrivances will work like these solid old tools, tried and trusty.\nYou will not have the heart after that to slander honest old presses\nthat go like mail coaches, and are good to last you your lifetime\nwithout needing repairs of any sort. Sabots! Yes, sabots that are like\nto hold salt enough to cook your eggs with--sabots that your father\nhas plodded on with these twenty years; they have helped him to make\nyou what you are.\"\n\nThe father, without coming to grief on the way, lurched down the worn,\nknotty staircase that shook under his tread. In the passage he opened\nthe door of the workshop, flew to the nearest press (artfully oiled\nand cleaned for the occasion) and pointed out the strong oaken cheeks,\npolished up by the apprentice.\n\n\"Isn't it a love of a press?\"\n\nA wedding announcement lay in the press. The old \"bear\" folded down\nthe frisket upon the tympan, and the tympan upon the form, ran in the\ncarriage, worked the lever, drew out the carriage, and lifted the\nfrisket and tympan, all with as much agility as the youngest of the\ntribe. The press, handled in this sort, creaked aloud in such fine\nstyle that you might have thought some bird had dashed itself against\nthe window pane and flown away again.\n\n\"Where is the English press that could go at that pace?\" the parent\nasked of his astonished son.\n\nOld Sechard hurried to the second, and then to the third in order,\nrepeating the manoeuvre with equal dexterity. The third presenting to\nhis wine-troubled eye a patch overlooked by the apprentice, with a\nnotable oath he rubbed it with the skirt of his overcoat, much as a\nhorse-dealer polishes the coat of an animal that he is trying to sell.\n\n\"With those three presses, David, you can make your nine thousand\nfrancs a year without a foreman. As your future partner, I am opposed\nto your replacing these presses by your cursed cast-iron machinery,\nthat wears out the type. You in Paris have been making such a to-do\nover that damned Englishman's invention--a foreigner, an enemy of\nFrance who wants to help the ironfounders to a fortune. Oh! you wanted\nStanhopes, did you? Thanks for your Stanhopes, that cost two thousand\nfive hundred francs apiece, about twice as much as my three jewels put\ntogether, and maul your type to pieces, because there is no give in\nthem. I haven't book-learning like you, but you keep this well in\nmind, the life of the Stanhope is the death of the type. Those three\npresses will serve your turn well enough, the printing will be\nproperly done, and folk here in Angouleme won't ask any more of you.\nYou may print with presses made of wood or iron or gold or silver,\n_they_ will never pay you a farthing more.\"\n\n\"'Item,'\" pursued David, \"'five thousand pounds weight of type from\nM. Vaflard's foundry----'\" Didot's apprentice could not help smiling\nat the name.\n\n\"Laugh away! After twelve years of wear, that type is as good as new.\nThat is what I call a typefounder! M. Vaflard is an honest man, who\nuses hard metal; and, to my way of thinking, the best typefounder is\nthe one you go to most seldom.\"\n\n\"'----Taken at ten thousand francs,'\" continued David. \"Ten thousand\nfrancs, father! Why, that is two francs a pound, and the Messrs. Didot\nonly ask thirty-six sous for their _Cicero_! These nail-heads of yours\nwill only fetch the price of old metal--fivepence a pound.\"\n\n\"You call M. Gille's italics, running-hand and round-hand,\n'nail-heads,' do you? M. Gille, that used to be printer to the Emperor!\nAnd type that costs six francs a pound! masterpieces of engraving,\nbought only five years ago. Some of them are as bright yet as when they\ncame from the foundry. Look here!\"\n\nOld Sechard pounced upon some packets of unused sorts, and held them\nout for David to see.\n\n\"I am not book-learned; I don't know how to read or write; but, all\nthe same, I know enough to see that M. Gille's sloping letters are the\nfathers of your Messrs. Didot's English running-hand. Here is the\nround-hand,\" he went on, taking up an unused pica type.\n\nDavid saw that there was no way of coming to terms with his father. It\nwas a case of Yes or No--of taking or leaving it. The very ropes\nacross the ceiling had gone down into the old \"bear's\" inventory, and\nnot the smallest item was omitted; jobbing chases, wetting-boards,\npaste-pots, rinsing-trough, and lye-brushes had all been put down and\nvalued separately with miserly exactitude. The total amounted to\nthirty thousand francs, including the license and the goodwill. David\nasked himself whether or not this thing was feasible.\n\nOld Sechard grew uneasy over his son's silence; he would rather have\nhad stormy argument than a wordless acceptance of the situation.\nChaffering in these sorts of bargains means that a man can look after\nhis interests. \"A man who is ready to pay you anything you ask will\npay nothing,\" old Sechard was saying to himself. While he tried to\nfollow his son's train of thought, he went through the list of odds\nand ends of plant needed by a country business, drawing David now to a\nhot-press, now to a cutting-press, bragging of its usefulness and\nsound condition.\n\n\"Old tools are always the best tools,\" said he. \"In our line of\nbusiness they ought to fetch more than the new, like goldbeaters'\ntools.\"\n\nHideous vignettes, representing Hymen and Cupids, skeletons raising\nthe lids of their tombs to describe a V or an M, and huge borders of\nmasks for theatrical posters became in turn objects of tremendous\nvalue through old Jerome-Nicolas' vinous eloquence. Old custom, he\ntold his son, was so deeply rooted in the district that he (David)\nwould only waste his pains if he gave them the finest things in life.\nHe himself had tried to sell them a better class of almanac than the\n_Double Liegeois_ on grocers' paper; and what came of it?--the original\n_Double Liegeois_ sold better than the most sumptuous calendars. David\nwould soon see the importance of these old-fashioned things when he\nfound he could get more for them than for the most costly new-fangled\narticles.\n\n\"Aha! my boy, Paris is Paris, and the provinces are the provinces. If\na man came in from L'Houmeau with an order for wedding cards, and you\nwere to print them without a Cupid and garlands, he would not believe\nthat he was properly married; you would have them all back again if\nyou sent them out with a plain M on them after the style of your\nMessrs. Didot. They may be fine printers, but their inventions won't\ntake in the provinces for another hundred years. So there you are.\"\n\nA generous man is a bad bargain-driver. David's nature was of the\nsensitive and affectionate type that shrinks from a dispute, and gives\nway at once if an opponent touches his feelings. His loftiness of\nfeeling, and the fact that the old toper had himself well in hand, put\nhim still further at a disadvantage in a dispute about money matters\nwith his own father, especially as he credited that father with the\nbest intentions, and took his covetous greed for a printer's\nattachment to his old familiar tools. Still, as Jerome-Nicolas Sechard\nhad taken the whole place over from Rouzeau's widow for ten thousand\nfrancs, paid in assignats, it stood to reason that thirty thousand\nfrancs in coin at the present day was an exorbitant demand.\n\n\"Father, you are cutting my throat!\" exclaimed David.\n\n\"_I_,\" cried the old toper, raising his hand to the lines of cord\nacross the ceiling, \"I who gave you life? Why, David, what do you\nsuppose the license is worth? Do you know that the sheet of\nadvertisements alone, at fivepence a line, brought in five hundred\nfrancs last month? You turn up the books, lad, and see what we make by\nplacards and the registers at the Prefecture, and the work for the\nmayor's office, and the bishop too. You are a do-nothing that has no\nmind to get on. You are haggling over the horse that will carry you to\nsome pretty bit of property like Marsac.\"\n\nAttached to the valuation of plant there was a deed of partnership\nbetween Sechard senior and his son. The good father was to let his\nhouse and premises to the new firm for twelve hundred francs per\nannum, reserving one of the two rooms in the roof for himself. So long\nas David's purchase-money was not paid in full, the profits were to be\ndivided equally; as soon as he paid off his father, he was to be made\nsole proprietor of the business.\n\nDavid made a mental calculation of the value of the license, the\ngoodwill, and the stock of paper, leaving the plant out of account. It\nwas just possible, he thought, to clear off the debt. He accepted the\nconditions. Old Sechard, accustomed to peasants' haggling, knowing\nnothing of the wider business views of Paris, was amazed at such a\nprompt conclusion.\n\n\"Can he have been putting money by?\" he asked himself. \"Or is he\nscheming out, at this moment, some way of not paying me?\"\n\nWith this notion in his head, he tried to find out whether David had\nany money with him; he wanted to be paid something on account. The old\nman's inquisitiveness roused his son's distrust; David remained close\nbuttoned up to the chin.\n\nNext day, old Sechard made the apprentice move all his own household\nstuff up into the attic until such time as an empty market cart could\ntake it out on the return journey into the country; and David entered\ninto possession of three bare, unfurnished rooms on the day that saw\nhim installed in the printing-house, without one sou wherewith to pay\nhis men's wages. When he asked his father, as a partner, to contribute\nhis share towards the working expenses, the old man pretended not to\nunderstand. He had found the printing-house, he said, and he was not\nbound to find the money too. He had paid his share. Pressed close by\nhis son's reasoning, he answered that when he himself had paid\nRouzeau's widow he had not had a penny left. If he, a poor, ignorant\nworking man, had made his way, Didot's apprentice should do still\nbetter. Besides, had not David been earning money, thanks to an\neducation paid for by the sweat of his old father's brow? Now surely\nwas the time when the education would come in useful.\n\n\"What have you done with your 'polls?'\" he asked, returning to the\ncharge. He meant to have light on a problem which his son left\nunresolved the day before.\n\n\"Why, had I not to live?\" David asked indignantly, \"and books to buy\nbesides?\"\n\n\"Oh! you bought books, did you? You will make a poor man of business.\nA man that buys books is hardly fit to print them,\" retorted the\n\"bear.\"\n\nThen David endured the most painful of humiliations--the sense of\nshame for a parent; there was nothing for it but to be passive while\nhis father poured out a flood of reasons--sordid, whining,\ncontemptible, money-getting reasons--in which the niggardly old man\nwrapped his refusal. David crushed down his pain into the depths of\nhis soul; he saw that he was alone; saw that he had no one to look to\nbut himself; saw, too, that his father was trying to make money out of\nhim; and in a spirit of philosophical curiosity, he tried to find out\nhow far the old man would go. He called old Sechard's attention to the\nfact that he had never as yet made any inquiry as to his mother's\nfortune; if that fortune would not buy the printing-house, it might go\nsome ways towards paying the working expenses.\n\n\"Your mother's fortune?\" echoed old Sechard; \"why, it was her beauty\nand intelligence!\"\n\nDavid understood his father thoroughly after that answer; he\nunderstood that only after an interminable, expensive, and disgraceful\nlawsuit could he obtain any account of the money which by rights was\nhis. The noble heart accepted the heavy burden laid upon it, seeing\nclearly beforehand how difficult it would be to free himself from the\nengagements into which he had entered with his father.\n\n\"I will work,\" he said to himself. \"After all, if I have a rough time\nof it, so had the old man; besides, I shall be working for myself,\nshall I not?\"\n\n\"I am leaving you a treasure,\" said Sechard, uneasy at his son's\nsilence.\n\nDavid asked what the treasure might be.\n\n\"Marion!\" said his father.\n\nMarion, a big country girl, was an indispensable part of the\nestablishment. It was Marion who damped the paper and cut it to size;\nMarion did the cooking, washing, and marketing; Marion unloaded the\npaper carts, collected accounts, and cleaned the ink-balls; and if\nMarion had but known how to read, old Sechard would have put her to\nset up type into the bargain.\n\n\n\nOld Sechard set out on foot for the country. Delighted as he was with\nhis sale of the business, he was not quite easy in his mind as to the\npayment. To the throes of the vendor, the agony of uncertainty as to\nthe completion of the purchase inevitably succeeds. Passion of every\nsort is essentially Jesuitical. Here was a man who thought that\neducation was useless, forcing himself to believe in the influence of\neducation. He was mortgaging thirty thousand francs upon the ideas of\nhonor and conduct which education should have developed in his son;\nDavid had received a good training, so David would sweat blood and\nwater to fulfil his engagements; David's knowledge would discover new\nresources; and David seemed to be full of fine feelings, so--David\nwould pay! Many a parent does in this way, and thinks that he has\nacted a father's part; old Sechard was quite of that opinion by the\ntime that he had reached his vineyard at Marsac, a hamlet some four\nleagues out of Angouleme. The previous owner had built a nice little\nhouse on the bit of property, and from year to year had added other\nbits of land to it, until in 1809 the old \"bear\" bought the whole, and\nwent thither, exchanging the toil of the printing press for the labor\nof the winepress. As he put it himself, \"he had been in that line so\nlong that he ought to know something about it.\"\n\nDuring the first twelvemonth of rural retirement, Sechard senior\nshowed a careful countenance among his vine props; for he was always\nin his vineyard now, just as, in the old days, he had lived in his\nshop, day in, day out. The prospect of thirty thousand francs was even\nmore intoxicating than sweet wine; already in imagination he fingered\nthe coin. The less the claim to the money, the more eager he grew to\npouch it. Not seldom his anxieties sent him hurrying from Marsac to\nAngouleme; he would climb up the rocky staircases into the old city\nand walk into his son's workshop to see how business went. There stood\nthe presses in their places; the one apprentice, in a paper cap, was\ncleaning the ink-balls; there was a creaking of a press over the\nprinting of some trade circular, the old type was still unchanged, and\nin the dens at the end of the room he saw his son and the foreman\nreading books, which the \"bear\" took for proof-sheets. Then he would\njoin David at dinner and go back to Marsac, chewing the cud of uneasy\nreflection.\n\nAvarice, like love, has the gift of second sight, instinctively\nguessing at future contingencies, and hugging its presentiments.\nSechard senior living at a distance, far from the workshop and the\nmachinery which possessed such a fascination for him, reminding him,\nas it did, of days when he was making his way, could _feel_ that there\nwere disquieting symptoms of inactivity in his son. The name of\nCointet Brothers haunted him like a dread; he saw Sechard & Son\ndropping into the second place. In short, the old man scented\nmisfortune in the wind.\n\nHis presentiments were too well founded; disaster was hovering over\nthe house of Sechard. But there is a tutelary deity for misers, and by\na chain of unforeseen circumstances that tutelary deity was so\nordering matters that the purchase-money of his extortionate bargain\nwas to be tumbled after all into the old toper's pouch.\n\nIndifferent to the religious reaction brought about by the\nRestoration, indifferent no less to the Liberal movement, David\npreserved a most unlucky neutrality on the burning questions of the\nday. In those times provincial men of business were bound to profess\npolitical opinions of some sort if they meant to secure custom; they\nwere forced to choose for themselves between the patronage of the\nLiberals on the one hand or the Royalists on the other. And Love,\nmoreover, had come to David's heart, and with his scientific\npreoccupation and finer nature he had not room for the dogged greed of\nwhich our successful man of business is made; it choked the keen\nmoney-getting instinct which would have led him to study the\ndifferences between the Paris trade and the business of a provincial\nprinting-house. The shades of opinion so sharply defined in the\ncountry are blurred and lost in the great currents of Parisian\nbusiness life. Cointet Brothers set themselves deliberately to\nassimilate all shades of monarchical opinion. They let every one know\nthat they fasted of a Friday and kept Lent; they haunted the\ncathedral; they cultivated the society of the clergy; and in\nconsequence, when books of devotion were once more in demand, Cointet\nBrothers were the first in this lucrative field. They slandered David,\naccusing him of Liberalism, Atheism, and what not. How, asked they,\ncould any one employ a man whose father had been a Septembrist, a\nBonapartist, and a drunkard to boot? The old man was sure to leave\nplenty of gold pieces behind him. They themselves were poor men with\nfamilies to support, while David was a bachelor and could do as he\npleased; he would have plenty one of these days; he could afford to\ntake things easily; whereas . . . and so forth and so forth.\n\nSuch tales against David, once put into circulation, produced their\neffect. The monopoly of the prefectorial and diocesan work passed\ngradually into the hands of Cointet Brothers; and before long David's\nkeen competitors, emboldened by his inaction, started a second local\nsheet of advertisements and announcements. The older establishment was\nleft at length with the job-printing orders from the town, and the\ncirculation of the _Charente Chronicle_ fell off by one-half. Meanwhile\nthe Cointets grew richer; they had made handsome profits on their\ndevotional books; and now they offered to buy Sechard's paper, to have\nall the trade and judicial announcements of the department in their\nown hands.\n\nThe news of this proposal sent by David to his father brought the old\nvinegrower from Marsac into the Place du Murier with the swiftness of\nthe raven that scents the corpses on a battlefield.\n\n\"Leave me to manage the Cointets,\" said he to his son; \"don't you\nmeddle in this business.\"\n\nThe old man saw what the Cointets meant; and they took alarm at his\nclearsighted sagacity. His son was making a blunder, he said, and he,\nSechard, had come to put a stop to it.\n\n\"What was to become of the connection if David gave up the paper? It\nall depended upon the paper. All the attorneys and solicitors and men\nof business in L'Houmeau were Liberals to a man. The Cointets had\ntried to ruin the Sechards by accusing them of Liberalism, and by so\ndoing gave them a plank to cling to--the Sechards should keep the\nLiberal business. Sell the paper indeed! Why, you might as well sell\nthe stock-in-trade and the license!\"\n\nOld Sechard asked the Cointets sixty thousand francs for the printing\nbusiness, so as not to ruin his son; he was fond of his son; he was\ntaking his son's part. The vinegrower brought his son to the front to\ngain his point, as a peasant brings in his wife.\n\nHis son was unwilling to do this, that, or the other; it varied\naccording to the offers which he wrung one after another from the\nCointets, until, not without an effort, he drew them on to give\ntwenty-two thousand francs for the _Charente Chronicle_. But, at the\nsame time, David must pledge himself thenceforward to print no\nnewspaper whatsoever, under a penalty of thirty thousand francs for\ndamages.\n\nThat transaction dealt the deathblow to the Sechard establishment; but\nthe old vinegrower did not trouble himself much on that head. Murder\nusually follows robbery. Our worthy friend intended to pay himself\nwith the ready money. To have the cash in his own hands he would have\ngiven in David himself over and above the bargain, and so much the\nmore willingly since that this nuisance of a son could claim one-half\nof the unexpected windfall. Taking this fact into consideration,\ntherefore, the generous parent consented to abandon his share of the\nbusiness but not the business premises; and the rental was still\nmaintained at the famous sum of twelve hundred francs per annum.\n\nThe old man came into town very seldom after the paper was sold to the\nCointets. He pleaded his advanced age, but the truth was that he took\nlittle interest in the establishment now that it was his no longer.\nStill, he could not quite shake off his old kindness for his\nstock-in-trade; and when business brought him into Angouleme, it would\nhave been hard to say which was the stronger attraction to the old house\n--his wooden presses or the son whom (as a matter of form) he asked for\nrent. The old foreman, who had gone over to the rival establishment,\nknew exactly how much this fatherly generosity was worth; the old fox\nmeant to reserve a right to interfere in his son's affairs, and had\ntaken care to appear in the bankruptcy as a privileged creditor for\narrears of rent.\n\nThe causes of David's heedlessness throw a light on the character of\nthat young man. Only a few days after his establishment in the\npaternal printing office, he came across an old school friend in the\ndirest poverty. Lucien Chardon, a young fellow of one-and-twenty or\nthereabouts, was the son of a surgeon-major who had retired with a\nwound from the republican army. Nature had meant M. Chardon senior for\na chemist; chance opened the way for a retail druggist's business in\nAngouleme. After many years of scientific research, death cut him off\nin the midst of his incompleted experiments, and the great discovery\nthat should have brought wealth to the family was never made. Chardon\nhad tried to find a specific for the gout. Gout is a rich man's\nmalady; the rich will pay large sums to recover health when they have\nlost it, and for this reason the druggist deliberately selected gout\nas his problem. Halfway between the man of science on the one side and\nthe charlatan on the other, he saw that the scientific method was the\none road to assured success, and had studied the causes of the\ncomplaint, and based his remedy on a certain general theory of\ntreatment, with modifications in practice for varying temperaments.\nThen, on a visit to Paris undertaken to solicit the approval of the\n_Academie des Sciences_, he died, and lost all the fruits of his labors.\n\nIt may have been that some presentiment of the end had led the country\ndruggist to do all that in him lay to give his boy and girl a good\neducation; the family had been living up to the income brought in by\nthe business; and now when they were left almost destitute, it was an\naggravation of their misfortune that they had been brought up in the\nexpectations of a brilliant future; for these hopes were extinguished\nby their father's death. The great Desplein, who attended Chardon in\nhis last illness, saw him die in convulsions of rage.\n\nThe secret of the army surgeon's ambition lay in his passionate love\nfor his wife, the last survivor of the family of Rubempre, saved as by\na miracle from the guillotine in 1793. He had gained time by declaring\nthat she was pregnant, a lie told without the girl's knowledge or\nconsent. Then, when in a manner he had created a claim to call her his\nwife, he had married her in spite of their common poverty. The\nchildren of this marriage, like all children of love, inherited the\nmother's wonderful beauty, that gift so often fatal when accompanied\nby poverty. The life of hope and hard work and despair, in all of\nwhich Mme. Chardon had shared with such keen sympathy, had left deep\ntraces in her beautiful face, just as the slow decline of a scanty\nincome had changed her ways and habits; but both she and her children\nconfronted evil days bravely enough. She sold the druggist's shop in\nthe Grand' Rue de L'Houmeau, the principal suburb of Angouleme; but it\nwas impossible for even one woman to exist on the three hundred francs\nof income brought in by the investment of the purchase-money, so the\nmother and daughter accepted the position, and worked to earn a\nliving. The mother went out as a monthly nurse, and for her gentle\nmanners was preferred to any other among the wealthy houses, where she\nlived without expense to her children, and earned some seven francs a\nweek. To save her son the embarrassment of seeing his mother reduced\nto this humble position, she assumed the name of Madame Charlotte; and\npersons requiring her services were requested to apply to M. Postel,\nM. Chardon's successor in the business. Lucien's sister worked for a\nlaundress, a decent woman much respected in L'Houmeau, and earned\nfifteen daily sous. As Mme. Prieur's forewoman she had a certain\nposition in the workroom, which raised her slightly above the class of\nworking-girls.\n\nThe two women's slender earnings, together with Mme. Chardon's three\nhundred francs of _rentes_, amounted to about eight hundred francs a\nyear, and on this sum three persons must be fed, clothed, and lodged.\nYet, with all their frugal thrift, the pittance was scarcely\nsufficient; nearly the whole of it was needed for Lucien. Mme. Chardon\nand her daughter Eve believed in Lucien as Mahomet's wife believed in\nher husband; their devotion for his future knew no bounds. Their\npresent landlord was the successor to the business, for M. Postel let\nthem have rooms at the further end of a yard at the back of the\nlaboratory for a very low rent, and Lucien slept in the poor garret\nabove. A father's passion for natural science had stimulated the boy,\nand at first induced him to follow in the same path. Lucien was one of\nthe most brilliant pupils at the grammar school of Angouleme, and when\nDavid Sechard left, his future friend was in the third form.\n\nWhen chance brought the school-fellows together again, Lucien was\nweary of drinking from the rude cup of penury, and ready for any of\nthe rash, decisive steps that youth takes at the age of twenty.\nDavid's generous offer of forty francs a month if Lucien would come to\nhim and learn the work of a printer's reader came in time; David had\nno need whatever of a printer's reader, but he saved Lucien from\ndespair. The ties of a school friendship thus renewed were soon drawn\ncloser than ever by the similarity of their lot in life and the\ndissimilarity of their characters. Both felt high swelling hopes of\nmanifold success; both consciously possessed the high order of\nintelligence which sets a man on a level with lofty heights, consigned\nthough they were socially to the lowest level. Fate's injustice was a\nstrong bond between them. And then, by different ways, following each\nhis own bent of mind, they had attained to poesy. Lucien, destined for\nthe highest speculative fields of natural science, was aiming with hot\nenthusiasm at fame through literature; while David, with that\nmeditative temperament which inclines to poetry, was drawn by his\ntastes towards natural science.\n\nThe exchange of roles was the beginning of an intellectual\ncomradeship. Before long, Lucien told David of his own father's\nfarsighted views of the application of science to manufacture, while\nDavid pointed out the new ways in literature that Lucien must follow\nif he meant to succeed. Not many days had passed before the young\nmen's friendship became a passion such as is only known in early\nmanhood. Then it was that David caught a glimpse of Eve's fair face,\nand loved, as grave and meditative natures can love. The _et nunc et\nsemper et in secula seculorum_ of the Liturgy is the device taken by\nmany a sublime unknown poet, whose works consist in magnificent epics\nconceived and lost between heart and heart. With a lover's insight,\nDavid read the secret hopes set by the mother and sister on Lucien's\npoet's brow; and knowing their blind devotion, it was very sweet to\nhim to draw nearer to his love by sharing her hopes and her\nself-sacrifice. And in this way Lucien came to be David's chosen\nbrother. As there are ultras who would fain be more Royalist than the\nKing, so David outdid the mother and sister in his belief in Lucien's\ngenius; he spoiled Lucien as a mother spoils her child.\n\nOnce, under pressure of the lack of money which tied their hands, the\ntwo were ruminating after the manner of young men over ways of\npromptly realizing a large fortune; and, after fruitless shakings of\nall the trees already stripped by previous comers, Lucien bethought\nhimself of two of his father's ideas. M. Chardon had talked of a\nmethod of refining sugar by a chemical process, which would reduce the\ncost of production by one-half; and he had another plan for employing\nan American vegetable fibre for making paper, something after the\nChinese fashion, and effecting an enormous saving in the cost of raw\nmaterial. David, knowing the importance of a question raised already\nby the Didots, caught at this latter notion, saw a fortune in it, and\nlooked upon Lucien as the benefactor whom he could never repay.\n\nAny one may guess how the ruling thoughts and inner life of this pair\nof friends unfitted them for carrying on the business of a printing\nhouse. So far from making fifteen to twenty thousand francs, like\nCointet Brothers, printers and publishers to the diocese, and\nproprietors of the _Charente Chronicle_ (now the only newspaper in the\ndepartment)--Sechard & Son made a bare three hundred francs per month,\nout of which the foreman's salary must be paid, as well as Marion's\nwages and the rent and taxes; so that David himself was scarcely\nmaking twelve hundred francs per annum. Active and industrious men of\nbusiness would have bought new type and new machinery, and made an\neffort to secure orders for cheap printing from the Paris book trade;\nbut master and foreman, deep in absorbing intellectual interests, were\nquite content with such orders as came to them from their remaining\ncustomers.\n\nIn the long length the Cointets had come to understand David's\ncharacter and habits. They did not slander him now; on the contrary,\nwise policy required that they should allow the business to flicker\non; it was to their interest indeed to maintain it in a small way,\nlest it should fall into the hands of some more formidable\ncompetitor; they made a practice of sending prospectuses and circulars\n--job-printing, as it is called--to the Sechard's establishment. So it\ncame about that, all unwittingly, David owed his existence,\ncommercially speaking, to the cunning schemes of his competitors. The\nCointets, well pleased with his \"craze,\" as they called it, behaved to\nall appearance both fairly and handsomely; but, as a matter of fact,\nthey were adopting the tactics of the mail-coach owners who set up a\nsham opposition coach to keep _bona fide_ rivals out of the field.\n\n\n\nInside and outside, the condition of the Sechard printing\nestablishment bore testimony to the sordid avarice of the old \"bear,\"\nwho never spent a penny on repairs. The old house had stood in sun and\nrain, and borne the brunt of the weather, till it looked like some\nvenerable tree trunk set down at the entrance of the alley, so riven\nit was with seams and cracks of all sorts and sizes. The house front,\nbuilt of brick and stone, with no pretensions to symmetry, seemed to\nbe bending beneath the weight of a worm-eaten roof covered with the\ncurved pantiles in common use in the South of France. The decrepit\ncasements were fitted with the heavy, unwieldy shutters necessary in\nthat climate, and held in place by massive iron cross bars. It would\nhave puzzled you to find a more dilapidated house in Angouleme;\nnothing but sheer tenacity of mortar kept it together. Try to picture\nthe workshop, lighted at either end, and dark in the middle; the walls\ncovered with handbills and begrimed by friction of all the workmen who\nhad rubbed past them for thirty years; the cobweb of cordage across\nthe ceiling, the stacks of paper, the old-fashioned presses, the pile\nof slabs for weighting the damp sheets, the rows of cases, and the two\ndens in the far corners where the master printer and foreman sat--and\nyou will have some idea of the life led by the two friends.\n\nOne day early in May, 1821, David and Lucien were standing together by\nthe window that looked into the yard. It was nearly two o'clock, and\nthe four or five men were going out to dinner. David waited until the\napprentice had shut the street door with the bell fastened to it; then\nhe drew Lucien out into the yard as if the smell of paper, ink, and\npresses and old woodwork had grown intolerable to him, and together\nthey sat down under the vines, keeping the office and the door in\nview. The sunbeams, playing among the trellised vine-shoots, hovered\nover the two poets, making, as it were, an aureole about their heads,\nbringing the contrast between their faces and their characters into a\nvigorous relief that would have tempted the brush of some great\npainter.\n\nDavid's physique was of the kind that Nature gives to the fighter, the\nman born to struggle in obscurity, or with the eyes of all men turned\nupon him. The strong shoulders, rising above the broad chest, were in\nkeeping with the full development of his whole frame. With his thick\ncrop of black hair, his fleshy, high-colored, swarthy face, supported\nby a thick neck, he looked at first sight like one of Boileau's\ncanons: but on a second glance there was that in the lines about the\nthick lips, in the dimple of the chin, in the turn of the square\nnostrils, with the broad irregular line of central cleavage, and,\nabove all, in the eyes, with the steady light of an all-absorbing love\nthat burned in them, which revealed the real character of the man--the\nwisdom of the thinker, the strenuous melancholy of a spirit that\ndiscerns the horizon on either side, and sees clearly to the end of\nwinding ways, turning the clear light of analysis upon the joys of\nfruition, known as yet in idea alone, and quick to turn from them in\ndisgust. You might look for the flash of genius from such a face; you\ncould not miss the ashes of the volcano; hopes extinguished beneath a\nprofound sense of the social annihilation to which lowly birth and\nlack of fortune condemns so many a loftier mind. And by the side of\nthe poor printer, who loathed a handicraft so closely allied to\nintellectual work, close to this Silenus, joyless, self-sustained,\ndrinking deep draughts from the cup of knowledge and of poetry that he\nmight forget the cares of his narrow lot in the intoxication of soul\nand brain, stood Lucien, graceful as some sculptured Indian Bacchus.\n\nFor in Lucien's face there was the distinction of line which stamps\nthe beauty of the antique; the Greek profile, with the velvet\nwhiteness of women's faces, and eyes full of love, eyes so blue that\nthey looked dark against a pearly setting, and dewy and fresh as those\nof a child. Those beautiful eyes looked out from under their long\nchestnut lashes, beneath eyebrows that might have been traced by a\nChinese pencil. The silken down on his cheeks, like his bright curling\nhair, shone golden in the sunlight. A divine graciousness transfused\nthe white temples that caught that golden gleam; a matchless nobleness\nhad set its seal in the short chin raised, but not abruptly. The smile\nthat hovered about the coral lips, yet redder as they seemed by force\nof contrast with the even teeth, was the smile of some sorrowing\nangel. Lucien's hands denoted race; they were shapely hands; hands\nthat men obey at a sign, and women love to kiss. Lucien was slender\nand of middle height. From a glance at his feet, he might have been\ntaken for a girl in disguise, and this so much the more easily from\nthe feminine contour of the hips, a characteristic of keen-witted, not\nto say, astute, men. This is a trait which seldom misleads, and in\nLucien it was a true indication of character; for when he analyzed the\nsociety of to-day, his restless mind was apt to take its stand on the\nlower ground of those diplomatists who hold that success justifies the\nuse of any means however base. It is one of the misfortunes attendant\nupon great intellects that perforce they comprehend all things, both\ngood and evil.\n\nThe two young men judged society by the more lofty standard because\ntheir social position was at the lowest end of the scale, for\nunrecognized power is apt to avenge itself for lowly station by\nviewing the world from a lofty standpoint. Yet it is, nevertheless,\ntrue that they grew but the more bitter and hopeless after these swift\nsoaring flights to the upper regions of thought, their world by right.\nLucien had read much and compared; David had thought much and deeply.\nIn spite of the young printer's look of robust, country-bred health,\nhis turn of mind was melancholy and somewhat morbid--he lacked\nconfidence in himself; but Lucien, on the other hand, with a boldness\nlittle to be expected from his feminine, almost effeminate, figure,\ngraceful though it was, Lucien possessed the Gascon temperament to the\nhighest degree--rash, brave, and adventurous, prone to make the most\nof the bright side, and as little as possible of the dark; his was the\nnature that sticks at no crime if there is anything to be gained by\nit, and laughs at the vice which serves as a stepping-stone. Just now\nthese tendencies of ambition were held in check, partly by the fair\nillusions of youth, partly by the enthusiasm which led him to prefer\nthe nobler methods, which every man in love with glory tries first of\nall. Lucien was struggling as yet with himself and his own desires,\nand not with the difficulties of life; at strife with his own power,\nand not with the baseness of other men, that fatal exemplar for\nimpressionable minds. The brilliancy of his intellect had a keen\nattraction for David. David admired his friend, while he kept him out\nof the scrapes into which he was led by the _furie francaise_.\n\nDavid, with his well-balanced mind and timid nature at variance with a\nstrong constitution, was by no means wanting in the persistence of the\nNorthern temper; and if he saw all the difficulties before him, none\nthe less he vowed to himself to conquer, never to give way. In him the\nunswerving virtue of an apostle was softened by pity that sprang from\ninexhaustible indulgence. In the friendship grown old already, one was\nthe worshiper, and that one was David; Lucien ruled him like a woman\nsure of love, and David loved to give way. He felt that his friend's\nphysical beauty implied a real superiority, which he accepted, looking\nupon himself as one made of coarser and commoner human clay.\n\n\"The ox for patient labor in the fields, the free life for the bird,\"\nhe thought to himself. \"I will be the ox, and Lucien shall be the\neagle.\"\n\nSo for three years these friends had mingled the destinies bright with\nsuch glorious promise. Together they read the great works that\nappeared above the horizon of literature and science since the Peace\n--the poems of Schiller, Goethe, and Byron, the prose writings of\nScott, Jean-Paul, Berzelius, Davy, Cuvier, Lamartine, and many more.\nThey warmed themselves beside these great hearthfires; they tried\ntheir powers in abortive creations, in work laid aside and taken up\nagain with new glow of enthusiasm. Incessantly they worked with the\nunwearied vitality of youth; comrades in poverty, comrades in the\nconsuming love of art and science, till they forgot the hard life of\nthe present, for their minds were wholly bent on laying the\nfoundations of future fame.\n\n\"Lucien,\" said David, \"do you know what I have just received from\nParis?\" He drew a tiny volume from his pocket. \"Listen!\"\n\nAnd David read, as a poet can read, first Andre de Chenier's Idyll\n_Neere_, then _Le Malade_, following on with the Elegy on a Suicide,\nanother elegy in the classic taste, and the last two _Iambes_.\n\n\"So that is Andre de Chenier!\" Lucien exclaimed again and again. \"It\nfills one with despair!\" he cried for the third time, when David\nsurrendered the book to him, unable to read further for emotion.--\"A\npoet rediscovered by a poet!\" said Lucien, reading the signature of\nthe preface.\n\n\"After Chenier had written those poems, he thought that he had written\nnothing worth publishing,\" added David.\n\nThen Lucien in his turn read aloud the fragment of an epic called\n_L'Aveugle_ and two or three of the Elegies, till, when he came upon the\nline--\n\n     If they know not bliss, is there happiness on earth?\n\nHe pressed the book to his lips, and tears came to the eyes of either,\nfor the two friends were lovers and fellow-worshipers.\n\nThe vine-stems were changing color with the spring; covering the\nrifted, battered walls of the old house where squalid cracks were\nspreading in every direction, with fluted columns and knots and\nbas-reliefs and uncounted masterpieces of I know not what order of\narchitecture, erected by fairy hands. Fancy had scattered flowers and\ncrimson gems over the gloomy little yard, and Chenier's _Camille_ became\nfor David the Eve whom he worshiped, for Lucien a great lady to whom\nhe paid his homage. Poetry had shaken out her starry robe above the\nworkshop where the \"monkeys\" and \"bears\" were grotesquely busy among\ntypes and presses. Five o'clock struck, but the friends felt neither\nhunger nor thirst; life had turned to a golden dream, and all the\ntreasures of the world lay at their feet. Far away on the horizon lay\nthe blue streak to which Hope points a finger in storm and stress; and\na siren voice sounded in their ears, calling, \"Come, spread your\nwings; through that streak of gold or silver or azure lies the sure\nway of escape from evil fortune!\"\n\nJust at that moment the low glass door of the workshop was opened, and\nout came Cerizet, an apprentice (David had brought the urchin from\nParis). This youth introduced a stranger, who saluted the friends\npolitely, and spoke to David.\n\n\"This, sir, is a monograph which I am desirous of printing,\" said he,\ndrawing a huge package of manuscript from his pocket. \"Will you oblige\nme with an estimate?\"\n\n\"We do not undertake work on such a scale, sir,\" David answered,\nwithout looking at the manuscript. \"You had better see the Messieurs\nCointet about it.\"\n\n\"Still we have a very pretty type which might suit it,\" put in Lucien,\ntaking up the roll. \"We must ask you to be kind enough, sir, to leave\nyour commission with us and call again to-morrow, and we will give you\nan estimate.\"\n\n\"Have I the pleasure of addressing M. Lucien Chardon?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said the foreman.\n\n\"I am fortunate in this opportunity of meeting with a young poet\ndestined to such greatness,\" returned the author. \"Mme. de Bargeton\nsent me here.\"\n\nLucien flushed red at the name, and stammered out something about\ngratitude for the interest which Mme. de Bargeton took in him. David\nnoticed his friend's embarrassed flush, and left him in conversation\nwith the country gentleman, the author of a monograph on silkwork\ncultivation, prompted by vanity to print the effort for the benefit of\nfellow-members of the local agricultural society.\n\nWhen the author had gone, David spoke.\n\n\"Lucien, are you in love with Mme. de Bargeton?\"\n\n\"Passionately.\"\n\n\"But social prejudices set you as far apart as if she were living at\nPekin and you in Greenland.\"\n\n\"The will of two lovers can rise victorious over all things,\" said\nLucien, lowering his eyes.\n\n\"You will forget us,\" returned the alarmed lover, as Eve's fair face\nrose before his mind.\n\n\"On the contrary, I have perhaps sacrificed my love to you,\" cried\nLucien.\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"In spite of my love, in spite of the different motives which bid me\nobtain a secure footing in her house, I have told her that I will\nnever go thither again unless another is made welcome too, a man whose\ngifts are greater than mine, a man destined for a brilliant future\n--David Sechard, my brother, my friend. I shall find an answer waiting\nwhen I go home. All the aristocrats may have been asked to hear me\nread my verses this evening, but I shall not go if the answer is\nnegative, and I will never set foot in Mme. de Bargeton's house\nagain.\"\n\nDavid brushed the tears from his eyes, and wrung Lucien's hand. The\nclock struck six.\n\n\"Eve must be anxious; good-bye,\" Lucien added abruptly.\n\nHe hurried away. David stood overcome by the emotion that is only felt\nto the full at his age, and more especially in such a position as his\n--the friends were like two young swans with wings unclipped as yet by\nthe experiences of provincial life.\n\n\"Heart of gold!\" David exclaimed to himself, as his eyes followed\nLucien across the workshop.\n\n\n\nLucien went down to L'Houmeau along the broad Promenade de Beaulieu,\nthe Rue du Minage, and Saint-Peter's Gate. It was the longest way\nround, so you may be sure that Mme. de Bargeton's house lay on the\nway. So delicious it was to pass under her windows, though she knew\nnothing of his presence, that for the past two months he had gone\nround daily by the Palet Gate into L'Houmeau.\n\nUnder the trees of Beaulieu he saw how far the suburb lay from the\ncity. The custom of the country, moreover, had raised other barriers\nharder to surmount than the mere physical difficulty of the steep\nflights of steps which Lucien was descending. Youth and ambition had\nthrown the flying-bridge of glory across the gulf between the city and\nthe suburb, yet Lucien was as uneasy in his mind over his lady's\nanswer as any king's favorite who has tried to climb yet higher, and\nfears that being over-bold he is like to fall. This must seem a dark\nsaying to those who have never studied the manners and customs of\ncities divided into the upper and lower town; wherefore it is\nnecessary to enter here upon some topographical details, and this so\nmuch the more if the reader is to comprehend the position of one of\nthe principal characters in the story--Mme. de Bargeton.\n\nThe old city of Angouleme is perched aloft on a crag like a\nsugar-loaf, overlooking the plain where the Charente winds away through\nthe meadows. The crag is an outlying spur on the Perigord side of a\nlong, low ridge of hill, which terminates abruptly just above the road\nfrom Paris to Bordeaux, so that the Rock of Angouleme is a sort of\npromontory marking out the line of three picturesque valleys. The\nramparts and great gateways and ruined fortress on the summit of the\ncrag still remain to bear witness to the importance of this stronghold\nduring the Religious Wars, when Angouleme was a military position\ncoveted alike of Catholics and Calvinists, but its old-world strength\nis a source of weakness in modern days; Angouleme could not spread\ndown to the Charente, and shut in between its ramparts and the steep\nsides of the crag, the old town is condemned to stagnation of the most\nfatal kind.\n\nThe Government made an attempt about this very time to extend the town\ntowards Perigord, building a Prefecture, a Naval School, and barracks\nalong the hillside, and opening up roads. But private enterprise had\nbeen beforehand elsewhere. For some time past the suburb of L'Houmeau\nhad sprung up, a mushroom growth at the foot of the crag and along the\nriver-side, where the direct road runs from Paris to Bordeaux.\nEverybody has heard of the great paper-mills of Angouleme, established\nperforce three hundred years ago on the Charente and its branch\nstreams, where there was a sufficient fall of water. The largest State\nfactory of marine ordnance in France was established at Ruelle, some\nsix miles away. Carriers, wheelwrights, posthouses, and inns, every\nagency for public conveyance, every industry that lives by road or\nriver, was crowded together in Lower Angouleme, to avoid the\ndifficulty of the ascent of the hill. Naturally, too, tanneries,\nlaundries, and all such waterside trades stood within reach of the\nCharente; and along the banks of the river lay the stores of brandy\nand great warehouses full of the water-borne raw material; all the\ncarrying trade of the Charente, in short, had lined the quays with\nbuildings.\n\nSo the Faubourg of L'Houmeau grew into a busy and prosperous city, a\nsecond Angouleme rivaling the upper town, the residence of the powers\nthat be, the lords spiritual and temporal of Angouleme; though\nL'Houmeau, with all its business and increasing greatness, was still a\nmere appendage of the city above. The _noblesse_ and officialdom dwelt\non the crag, trade and wealth remained below. No love was lost between\nthese two sections of the community all the world over, and in\nAngouleme it would have been hard to say which of the two camps\ndetested the other the more cordially. Under the Empire the machinery\nworked fairly smoothly, but the Restoration wrought both sides to the\nhighest pitch of exasperation.\n\nNearly every house in the upper town of Angouleme is inhabited by\nnoble, or at any rate by old burgher, families, who live independently\non their incomes--a sort of autochthonous nation who suffer no aliens\nto come among them. Possibly, after two hundred years of unbroken\nresidence, and it may be an intermarriage or two with one of the\nprimordial houses, a family from some neighboring district may be\nadopted, but in the eyes of the aboriginal race they are still\nnewcomers of yesterday.\n\nPrefects, receivers-general, and various administrations that have\ncome and gone during the last forty years, have tried to tame the\nancient families perched aloft like wary ravens on their crag; the\nsaid families were always willing to accept invitations to dinners and\ndances; but as to admitting the strangers to their own houses, they\nwere inexorable. Ready to scoff and disparage, jealous and niggardly,\nmarrying only among themselves, the families formed a serried phalanx\nto keep out intruders. Of modern luxury they had no notion; and as for\nsending a boy to Paris, it was sending him, they thought to certain\nruin. Such sagacity will give a sufficient idea of the old-world\nmanners and customs of this society, suffering from thick-headed\nRoyalism, infected with bigotry rather than zeal, all stagnating\ntogether, motionless as their town founded upon a rock. Yet Angouleme\nenjoyed a great reputation in the provinces round about for its\neducational advantages, and neighboring towns sent their daughters to\nits boarding schools and convents.\n\nIt is easy to imagine the influence of the class sentiment which held\nAngouleme aloof from L'Houmeau. The merchant classes are rich, the\n_noblesse_ are usually poor. Each side takes its revenge in scorn of the\nother. The tradespeople in Angouleme espouse the quarrel. \"He is a man\nof L'Houmeau!\" a shopkeeper of the upper town will tell you, speaking\nof a merchant in the lower suburb, throwing an accent into the speech\nwhich no words can describe. When the Restoration defined the position\nof the French _noblesse_, holding out hopes to them which could only be\nrealized by a complete and general topsy-turvydom, the distance\nbetween Angouleme and L'Houmeau, already more strongly marked than the\ndistance between the hill and plain, was widened yet further. The\nbetter families, all devoted as one man to the Government, grew more\nexclusive here than in any other part of France. \"The man of\nL'Houmeau\" became little better than a pariah. Hence the deep,\nsmothered hatred which broke out everywhere with such ugly unanimity\nin the insurrection of 1830 and destroyed the elements of a durable\nsocial system in France. As the overweening haughtiness of the Court\nnobles detached the provincial _noblesse_ from the throne, so did these\nlast alienate the _bourgeoisie_ from the royal cause by behavior that\ngalled their vanity in every possible way.\n\nSo \"a man of L'Houmeau,\" a druggist's son, in Mme. de Bargeton's house\nwas nothing less than a little revolution. Who was responsible for it?\nLamartine and Victor Hugo, Casimir Delavigne and Canalis, Beranger and\nChateaubriand. Davrigny, Benjamin Constant and Lamennais, Cousin and\nMichaud,--all the old and young illustrious names in literature in\nshort, Liberals and Royalists, alike must divide the blame among them.\nMme. de Bargeton loved art and letters, eccentric taste on her part, a\ncraze deeply deplored in Angouleme. In justice to the lady, it is\nnecessary to give a sketch of the previous history of a woman born to\nshine, and left by unlucky circumstances in the shade, a woman whose\ninfluence decided Lucien's career.\n\nM. de Bargeton was the great-grandson of an alderman of Bordeaux named\nMirault, ennobled under Louis XIII. for long tenure of office. His\nson, bearing the name of Mirault de Bargeton, became an officer in the\nhousehold troops of Louis XIV., and married so great a fortune that in\nthe reign of Louis XV. his son dropped the Mirault and was called\nsimply M. de Bargeton. This M. de Bargeton, the alderman's grandson,\nlived up to his quality so strenuously that he ran through the family\nproperty and checked the course of its fortunes. Two of his brothers\nindeed, great-uncles of the present Bargeton, went into business\nagain, for which reason you will find the name of Mirault among\nBordeaux merchants at this day. The lands of Bargeton, in Angoumois in\nthe barony of Rochefoucauld, being entailed, and the house in\nAngouleme, called the Hotel Bargeton, likewise, the grandson of M. de\nBargeton the Waster came in for these hereditaments; though the year\n1789 deprived him of all seignorial rights save to the rents paid by\nhis tenants, which amounted to some ten thousand francs per annum. If\nhis grandsire had but walked in the ways of his illustrious\nprogenitors, Bargeton I. and Bargeton II., Bargeton V. (who may be\ndubbed Bargeton the Mute by way of distinction) should by rights have\nbeen born to the title of Marquis of Bargeton; he would have been\nconnected with some great family or other, and in due time he would\nhave been a duke and a peer of France, like many another; whereas, in\n1805, he thought himself uncommonly lucky when he married Mlle.\nMarie-Louise-Anais de Negrepelisse, the daughter of a noble long\nrelegated to the obscurity of his manor-house, scion though he was of\nthe younger branch of one of the oldest families in the south of\nFrance. There had been a Negrepelisse among the hostages of St. Louis.\nThe head of the elder branch, however, had borne the illustrious name\nof d'Espard since the reign of Henri Quatre, when the Negrepelisse of\nthat day married an heiress of the d'Espard family. As for M. de\nNegrepelisse, the younger son of a younger son, he lived upon his\nwife's property, a small estate in the neighborhood of Barbezieux,\nfarming the land to admiration, selling his corn in the market\nhimself, and distilling his own brandy, laughing at those who\nridiculed him, so long as he could pile up silver crowns, and now and\nagain round out his estate with another bit of land.\n\nCircumstances unusual enough in out-of-the-way places in the country\nhad inspired Mme. de Bargeton with a taste for music and reading.\nDuring the Revolution one Abbe Niollant, the Abbe Roze's best pupil,\nfound a hiding-place in the old manor-house of Escarbas, and brought\nwith him his baggage of musical compositions. The old country\ngentleman's hospitality was handsomely repaid, for the Abbe undertook\nhis daughter's education. Anais, or Nais, as she was called must\notherwise have been left to herself, or, worse still, to some\ncoarse-minded servant-maid. The Abbe was not only a musician, he was\nwell and widely read, and knew both Italian and German; so Mlle. de\nNegrepelise received instruction in those tongues, as well as in\ncounterpoint. He explained the great masterpieces of the French,\nGerman, and Italian literatures, and deciphered with her the music of\nthe great composers. Finally, as time hung heavy on his hands in the\nseclusion enforced by political storms, he taught his pupil Latin and\nGreek and some smatterings of natural science. A mother might have\nmodified the effects of a man's education upon a young girl, whose\nindependent spirit had been fostered in the first place by a country\nlife. The Abbe Niollant, an enthusiast and a poet, possessed the\nartistic temperament in a peculiarly high degree, a temperament\ncompatible with many estimable qualities, but prone to raise itself\nabove _bourgeois_ prejudices by the liberty of its judgments and\nbreadth of view. In society an intellect of this order wins pardon for\nits boldness by its depth and originality; but in private life it\nwould seem to do positive mischief, by suggesting wanderings from the\nbeaten track. The Abbe was by no means wanting in goodness of heart,\nand his ideas were therefore the more contagious for this high-spirited\ngirl, in whom they were confirmed by a lonely life. The Abbe Niollant's\npupil learned to be fearless in criticism and ready in judgement; it\nnever occurred to her tutor that qualities so necessary in a man are\ndisadvantages in a woman destined for the homely life of a\nhouse-mother. And though the Abbe constantly impressed it upon his\npupil that it behoved her to be the more modest and gracious with the\nextent of her attainments, Mlle. de Negrepelisse conceived an excellent\nopinion of herself and a robust contempt for ordinary humanity. All\nthose about her were her inferiors, or persons who hastened to do her\nbidding, till she grew to be as haughty as a great lady, with none of\nthe charming blandness and urbanity of a great lady. The instincts of\nvanity were flattered by the pride that the poor Abbe took in his\npupil, the pride of an author who sees himself in his work, and for\nher misfortune she met no one with whom she could measure herself.\nIsolation is one of the greatest drawbacks of a country life. We lose\nthe habit of putting ourselves to any inconvenience for the sake of\nothers when there is no one for whom to make the trifling sacrifices\nof personal effort required by dress and manner. And everything in us\nshares in the change for the worse; the form and the spirit\ndeteriorate together.\n\nWith no social intercourse to compel self-repression, Mlle. de\nNegrepelisse's bold ideas passed into her manner and the expression of\nher face. There was a cavalier air about her, a something that seems\nat first original, but only suited to women of adventurous life. So\nthis education, and the consequent asperities of character, which\nwould have been softened down in a higher social sphere, could only\nserve to make her ridiculous at Angouleme so soon as her adorers\nshould cease to worship eccentricities that charm only in youth.\n\nAs for M. de Negrepelisse, he would have given all his daughter's\nbooks to save the life of a sick bullock; and so miserly was he, that\nhe would not have given her two farthings over and above the allowance\nto which she had a right, even if it had been a question of some\nindispensable trifle for her education.\n\nIn 1802 the Abbe died, before the marriage of his dear child, a\nmarriage which he, doubtless, would never have advised. The old father\nfound his daughter a great care now that the Abbe was gone. The\nhigh-spirited girl, with nothing else to do, was sure to break into\nrebellion against his niggardliness, and he felt quite unequal to the\nstruggle. Like all young women who leave the appointed track of\nwoman's life, Nais had her own opinions about marriage, and had no\ngreat inclination thereto. She shrank from submitting herself, body\nand soul, to the feeble, undignified specimens of mankind whom she had\nchanced to meet. She wished to rule, marriage meant obedience; and\nbetween obedience to coarse caprices and a mind without indulgence for\nher tastes, and flight with a lover who should please her, she would\nnot have hesitated for a moment.\n\nM. de Negrepelisse maintained sufficient of the tradition of birth to\ndread a _mesalliance_. Like many another parent, he resolved to marry\nhis daughter, not so much on her account as for his own peace of mind.\nA noble or a country gentleman was the man for him, somebody not too\nclever, incapable of haggling over the account of the trust; stupid\nenough and easy enough to allow Nais to have her own way, and\ndisinterested enough to take her without a dowry. But where to look\nfor a son-in-law to suit father and daughter equally well, was the\nproblem. Such a man would be the phoenix of sons-in-law.\n\nTo M. de Negrepelisse pondering over the eligible bachelors of the\nprovince with these double requirements in his mind. M. de Bargeton\nseemed to be the only one who answered to this description. M. de\nBargeton, aged forty, considerably shattered by the amorous\ndissipations of his youth, was generally held to be a man of\nremarkably feeble intellect; but he had just the exact amount of\ncommonsense required for the management of his fortune, and breeding\nsufficient to enable him to avoid blunders or blatant follies in\nsociety in Angouleme. In the bluntest manner M. de Negrepelisse\npointed out the negative virtues of the model husband designed for his\ndaughter, and made her see the way to manage him so as to secure her\nown happiness. So Nais married the bearer of arms, two hundred years\nold already, for the Bargeton arms are blazoned thus: _the first or,\nthree attires gules; the second, three ox's heads cabossed, two and\none, sable; the third, barry of six, azure and argent, in the first,\nsix shells or, three, two, and one_. Provided with a chaperon, Nais\ncould steer her fortunes as she chose under the style of the firm, and\nwith the help of such connections as her wit and beauty would obtain\nfor her in Paris. Nais was enchanted by the prospect of such liberty.\nM. de Bargeton was of the opinion that he was making a brilliant\nmarriage, for he expected that in no long while M. de Negrepelisse\nwould leave him the estates which he was rounding out so lovingly; but\nto an unprejudiced spectator it certainly seemed as though the duty of\nwriting the bridegroom's epitaph might devolve upon his father-in-law.\n\nBy this time Mme. de Bargeton was thirty-six years old and her husband\nfifty-eight. The disparity in age was the more startling since M. de\nBargeton looked like a man of seventy, whereas his wife looked\nscarcely half her age. She could still wear rose-color, and her hair\nhanging loose upon her shoulders. Although their income did not exceed\ntwelve thousand francs, they ranked among the half-dozen largest\nfortunes in the old city, merchants and officials excepted; for M. and\nMme. de Bargeton were obliged to live in Angouleme until such time as\nMme. de Bargeton's inheritance should fall in and they could go to\nParis. Meanwhile they were bound to be attentive to old M. de\nNegrepelisse (who kept them waiting so long that his son-in-law in\nfact predeceased him), and Nais' brilliant intellectual gifts, and the\nwealth that lay like undiscovered ore in her nature, profited her\nnothing, underwent the transforming operation of Time and changed to\nabsurdities. For our absurdities spring, in fact, for the most part,\nfrom the good in us, from some faculty or quality abnormally\ndeveloped. Pride, untempered by intercourse with the great world\nbecomes stiff and starched by contact with petty things; in a loftier\nmoral atmosphere it would have grown to noble magnanimity. Enthusiasm,\nthat virtue within a virtue, forming the saint, inspiring the devotion\nhidden from all eyes and glowing out upon the world in verse, turns to\nexaggeration, with the trifles of a narrow existence for its object.\nFar away from the centres of light shed by great minds, where the air\nis quick with thought, knowledge stands still, taste is corrupted like\nstagnant water, and passion dwindles, frittered away upon the\ninfinitely small objects which it strives to exalt. Herein lies the\nsecret of the avarice and tittle-tattle that poison provincial life.\nThe contagion of narrow-mindedness and meanness affects the noblest\nnatures; and in such ways as these, men born to be great, and women\nwho would have been charming if they had fallen under the forming\ninfluence of greater minds, are balked of their lives.\n\nHere was Mme. de Bargeton, for instance, smiting the lyre for every\ntrifle, and publishing her emotions indiscriminately to her circle. As\na matter of fact, when sensations appeal to an audience of one, it is\nbetter to keep them to ourselves. A sunset certainly is a glorious\npoem; but if a woman describes it, in high-sounding words, for the\nbenefit of matter-of-fact people, is she not ridiculous? There are\npleasures which can only be felt to the full when two souls meet, poet\nand poet, heart and heart. She had a trick of using high-sounding\nphrases, interlarded with exaggerated expressions, the kind of stuff\ningeniously nicknamed _tartines_ by the French journalist, who furnishes\na daily supply of the commodity for a public that daily performs the\ndifficult feat of swallowing it. She squandered superlatives\nrecklessly in her talk, and the smallest things took giant\nproportions. It was at this period of her career that she began to\ntype-ize, individualize, synthesize, dramatize, superiorize, analyze,\npoetize, angelize, neologize, tragedify, prosify, and colossify--you\nmust violate the laws of language to find words to express the\nnew-fangled whimsies in which even women here and there indulge. The\nheat of her language communicated itself to the brain, and the\ndithyrambs on her lips were spoken out of the abundance of her heart.\nShe palpitated, swooned, and went into ecstasies over anything and\neverything, over the devotion of a sister of Charity, and the\nexecution of the brothers Fauchet, over M. d'Arlincourt's _Ipsiboe_,\nLewis' _Anaconda_, or the escape of La Valette, or the presence of mind\nof a lady friend who put burglars to flight by imitating a man's\nvoice. Everything was heroic, extraordinary, strange, wonderful, and\ndivine. She would work herself into a state of excitement,\nindignation, or depression; she soared to heaven, and sank again,\ngazed at the sky, or looked to earth; her eyes were always filled with\ntears. She wore herself out with chronic admiration, and wasted her\nstrength on curious dislikes. Her mind ran on the Pasha of Janina; she\nwould have liked to try conclusions with him in his seraglio, and had\na great notion of being sewn in a sack and thrown into the water. She\nenvied that blue-stocking of the desert, Lady Hester Stanhope; she\nlonged to be a sister of Saint Camilla and tend the sick and die of\nyellow fever in a hospital at Barcelona; 'twas a high, a noble\ndestiny! In short, she thirsted for any draught but the clear spring\nwater of her own life, flowing hidden among green pastures. She adored\nByron and Jean-Jacques Rousseau, or anybody else with a picturesque or\ndramatic career. Her tears were ready to flow for every misfortune;\nshe sang paeans for every victory. She sympathized with the fallen\nNapoleon, and with Mehemet Ali, massacring the foreign usurpers of\nEgypt. In short, any kind of genius was accommodated with an aureole,\nand she was fully persuaded that gifted immortals lived on incense and\nlight.\n\nA good many people looked upon her as a harmless lunatic, but in these\nextravagances of hers a keener observer surely would have seen the\nbroken fragments of a magnificent edifice that had crumbled into ruin\nbefore it was completed, the stones of a heavenly Jerusalem--love, in\nshort, without a lover. And this was indeed the fact.\n\nThe story of the first eighteen years of Mme. de Bargeton's married\nlife can be summed up in a few words. For a long while she lived upon\nherself and distant hopes. Then, when she began to see that their\nnarrow income put the longed-for life in Paris quite out of the\nquestion, she looked about her at the people with whom her life must\nbe spent, and shuddered at her loneliness. There was not a single man\nwho could inspire the madness to which women are prone when they\ndespair of a life become stale and unprofitable in the present, and\nwith no outlook for the future. She had nothing to look for, nothing\nto expect from chance, for there are lives in which chance plays no\npart. But when the Empire was in the full noonday of glory, and\nNapoleon was sending the flower of his troops to the Peninsula, her\ndisappointed hopes revived. Natural curiosity prompted her to make an\neffort to see the heroes who were conquering Europe in obedience to a\nword from the Emperor in the order of the day; the heroes of a modern\ntime who outdid the mythical feats of paladins of old. The cities of\nFrance, however avaricious or refractory, must perforce do honor to\nthe Imperial Guard, and mayors and prefects went out to meet them with\nset speeches as if the conquerors had been crowned kings. Mme. de\nBargeton went to a _ridotto_ given to the town by a regiment, and fell\nin love with an officer of a good family, a sub-lieutenant, to whom\nthe crafty Napoleon had given a glimpse of the baton of a Marshal of\nFrance. Love, restrained, greater and nobler than the ties that were\nmade and unmade so easily in those days, was consecrated coldly by the\nhands of death. On the battlefield of Wagram a shell shattered the\nonly record of Mme. de Bargeton's young beauty, a portrait worn on the\nheart of the Marquis of Cante-Croix. For long afterwards she wept for\nthe young soldier, the colonel in his second campaign, for the heart\nhot with love and glory that set a letter from Nais above Imperial\nfavor. The pain of those days cast a veil of sadness over her face, a\nshadow that only vanished at the terrible age when a woman first\ndiscovers with dismay that the best years of her life are over, and\nshe has had no joy of them; when she sees her roses wither, and the\nlonging for love is revived again with the desire to linger yet for a\nlittle on the last smiles of youth. Her nobler qualities dealt so many\nwounds to her soul at the moment when the cold of the provinces seized\nupon her. She would have died of grief like the ermine if by chance\nshe had been sullied by contact with those men whose thoughts are bent\non winning a few sous nightly at cards after a good dinner; pride\nsaved her from the shabby love intrigues of the provinces. A woman so\nmuch above the level of those about her, forced to decide between the\nemptiness of the men whom she meets and the emptiness of her own life,\ncan make but one choice; marriage and society became a cloister for\nAnais. She lived by poetry as the Carmelite lives by religion. All the\nfamous foreign books published in France for the first time between\n1815 and 1821, the great essayists, M. de Bonald and M. de Maistre\n(those two eagles of thought)--all the lighter French literature, in\nshort, that appeared during that sudden outburst of first vigorous\ngrowth might bring delight into her solitary life, but not flexibility\nof mind or body. She stood strong and straight like some forest tree,\nlightning-blasted but still erect. Her dignity became a stilted\nmanner, her social supremacy led her into affectation and sentimental\nover-refinements; she queened it with her foibles, after the usual\nfashion of those who allow their courtiers to adore them.\n\nThis was Mme. de Bargeton's past life, a dreary chronicle which must\nbe given if Lucien's position with regard to the lady is to be\ncomprehensible. Lucien's introduction came about oddly enough. In the\nprevious winter a newcomer had brought some interest into Mme. de\nBargeton's monotonous life. The place of controller of excise fell\nvacant, and M. de Barante appointed a man whose adventurous life was a\nsufficient passport to the house of the sovereign lady who had her\nshare of feminine curiosity.\n\nM. de Chatelet--he began life as plain Sixte Chatelet, but since 1806\nhad the wit to adopt the particle--M. du Chatelet was one of the\nagreeable young men who escaped conscription after conscription by\nkeeping very close to the Imperial sun. He had begun his career as\nprivate secretary to an Imperial Highness, a post for which he\npossessed every qualification. Personable and of a good figure, a\nclever billiard-player, a passable amateur actor, he danced well, and\nexcelled in most physical exercises; he could, moreover, sing a ballad\nand applaud a witticism. Supple, envious, never at a loss, there was\nnothing that he did not know--nothing that he really knew. He knew\nnothing, for instance, of music, but he could sit down to the piano\nand accompany, after a fashion, a woman who consented after much\npressing to sing a ballad learned by heart in a month of hard\npractice. Incapable though he was of any feeling for poetry, he would\nboldly ask permission to retire for ten minutes to compose an\nimpromptu, and return with a quatrain, flat as a pancake, wherein\nrhyme did duty for reason. M. du Chatelet had besides a very pretty\ntalent for filling in the ground of the Princess' worsted work after\nthe flowers had been begun; he held her skeins of silk with infinite\ngrace, entertained her with dubious nothings more or less\ntransparently veiled. He was ignorant of painting, but he could copy a\nlandscape, sketch a head in profile, or design a costume and color it.\nHe had, in short, all the little talents that a man could turn to such\nuseful account in times when women exercised more influence in public\nlife than most people imagine. Diplomacy he claimed to be his strong\npoint; it usually is with those who have no knowledge, and are\nprofound by reason of their emptiness; and, indeed, this kind of skill\npossesses one signal advantage, for it can only be displayed in the\nconduct of the affairs of the great, and when discretion is the\nquality required, a man who knows nothing can safely say nothing, and\ntake refuge in a mysterious shake of the head; in fact; the cleverest\npractitioner is he who can swim with the current and keep his head\nwell above the stream of events which he appears to control, a man's\nfitness for this business varying inversely as his specific gravity.\nBut in this particular art or craft, as in all others, you shall find\na thousand mediocrities for one man of genius; and in spite of\nChatelet's services, ordinary and extraordinary, Her Imperial Highness\ncould not procure a seat in the Privy Council for her private\nsecretary; not that he would not have made a delightful Master of\nRequests, like many another, but the Princess was of the opinion that\nher secretary was better placed with her than anywhere else in the\nworld. He was made a Baron, however, and went to Cassel as\nenvoy-extraordinary, no empty form of words, for he cut a very\nextraordinary figure there--Napoleon used him as a diplomatic courier\nin the thick of a European crisis. Just as he had been promised the\npost of minister to Jerome in Westphalia, the Empire fell to pieces;\nand balked of his _ambassade de famille_ as he called it, he went off\nin despair to Egypt with General de Montriveau. A strange chapter of\naccidents separated him from his traveling companion, and for two long\nyears Sixte du Chatelet led a wandering life among the Arab tribes of\nthe desert, who sold and resold their captive--his talents being not\nof the slightest use to the nomad tribes. At length, about the time\nthat Montriveau reached Tangier, Chatelet found himself in the\nterritory of the Imam of Muscat, had the luck to find an English\nvessel just about to set sail, and so came back to Paris a year sooner\nthan his sometime companion. Once in Paris, his recent misfortunes,\nand certain connections of long standing, together with services\nrendered to great persons now in power, recommended him to the\nPresident of the Council, who put him in M. de Barante's department\nuntil such time as a controllership should fall vacant. So the part\nthat M. du Chatelet once had played in the history of the Imperial\nPrincess, his reputation for success with women, the strange story of\nhis travels and sufferings, all awakened the interest of the ladies of\nAngouleme.\n\nM. le Baron Sixte du Chatelet informed himself as to the manners and\ncustoms of the upper town, and took his cue accordingly. He appeared\non the scene as a jaded man of the world, broken in health, and weary\nin spirit. He would raise his hand to his forehead at all seasons, as\nif pain never gave him a moment's respite, a habit that recalled his\ntravels and made him interesting. He was on visiting terms with the\nauthorities--the general in command, the prefect, the\nreceiver-general, and the bishop but in every house he was frigid,\npolite, and slightly supercilious, like a man out of his proper place\nawaiting the favors of power. His social talents he left to conjecture,\nnor did they lose anything in reputation on that account; then when\npeople began to talk about him and wish to know him, and curiosity was\nstill lively; when he had reconnoitred the men and found them nought,\nand studied the women with the eyes of experience in the cathedral for\nseveral Sundays, he saw that Mme. de. Bargeton was the person with\nwhom it would be best to be on intimate terms. Music, he thought,\nshould open the doors of a house where strangers were never received.\nSurreptitiously he procured one of Miroir's Masses, learned it upon\nthe piano; and one fine Sunday when all Angouleme went to the\ncathedral, he played the organ, sent those who knew no better into\necstasies over the performance, and stimulated the interest felt in\nhim by allowing his name to slip out through the attendants. As he\ncame out after mass, Mme. de Bargeton complimented him, regretting\nthat she had no opportunity of playing duets with such a musician; and\nnaturally, during an interview of her own seeking, he received the\npassport, which he could not have obtained if he had asked for it.\n\nSo the adroit Baron was admitted to the circle of the queen of\nAngouleme, and paid her marked attention. The elderly beau--he was\nforty-five years old--saw that all her youth lay dormant and ready to\nrevive, saw treasures to be turned to account, and possibly a rich\nwidow to wed, to say nothing of expectations; it would be a marriage\ninto the family of Negrepelisse, and for him this meant a family\nconnection with the Marquise d'Espard, and a political career in\nParis. Here was a fair tree to cultivate in spite of the ill-omened,\nunsightly mistletoe that grew thick upon it; he would hang his\nfortunes upon it, and prune it, and wait till he could gather its\ngolden fruit.\n\nHigh-born Angouleme shrieked against the introduction of a Giaour into\nthe sanctuary, for Mme. de Bargeton's salon was a kind of holy of\nholies in a society that kept itself unspotted from the world. The\nonly outsider intimate there was the bishop; the prefect was admitted\ntwice or thrice in a year, the receiver-general was never received at\nall; Mme. de Bargeton would go to concerts and \"at homes\" at his\nhouse, but she never accepted invitations to dinner. And now, she who\nhad declined to open her doors to the receiver-general, welcomed a\nmere controller of excise! Here was a novel order of precedence for\nsnubbed authority; such a thing it had never entered their minds to\nconceive.\n\nThose who by dint of mental effort can understand a kind of pettiness\nwhich, for that matter, can be found on any and every social level,\nwill realize the awe with which the _bourgeoisie_ of Angouleme regarded\nthe Hotel de Bargeton. The inhabitant of L'Houmeau beheld the grandeur\nof that miniature Louvre, the glory of the Angoumoisin Hotel de\nRambouillet, shining at a solar distance; and yet, within it there was\ngathered together all the direst intellectual poverty, all the decayed\ngentility from twenty leagues round about.\n\nPolitical opinion expanded itself in wordy commonplaces vociferated\nwith emphasis; the _Quotidienne_ was comparatively Laodicean in its\nloyalty, and Louis XVIII. a Jacobin. The women, for the most part,\nwere awkward, silly, insipid, and ill dressed; there was always\nsomething amiss that spoiled the whole; nothing in them was complete,\ntoilette or talk, flesh or spirit. But for his designs on Mme. de\nBargeton, Chatelet could not have endured the society. And yet the\nmanners and spirit of the noble in his ruined manor-house, the\nknowledge of the traditions of good breeding,--these things covered a\nmultitude of deficiencies. Nobility of feeling was far more real here\nthan in the lofty world of Paris. You might compare these country\nRoyalists, if the metaphor may be allowed, to old-fashioned silver\nplate, antiquated and tarnished, but weighty; their attachment to the\nHouse of Bourbon as the House of Bourbon did them honor. The very\nfixity of their political opinions was a sort of faithfulness. The\ndistance that they set between themselves and the _bourgeoisie_, their\nvery exclusiveness, gave them a certain elevation, and enhanced their\nvalue. Each noble represented a certain price for the townsmen, as\nBambara Negroes, we are told, attach a money value to cowrie shells.\n\nSome of the women, flattered by M. du Chatelet, discerned in him the\nsuperior qualities lacking in the men of their own sect, and the\ninsurrection of self-love was pacified. These ladies all hoped to\nsucceed to the Imperial Highness. Purists were of the opinion that you\nmight see the intruder in Mme. de Bargeton's house, but not elsewhere.\nDu Chatelet was fain to put up with a good deal of insolence, but he\nheld his ground by cultivating the clergy. He encouraged the queen of\nAngouleme in foibles bred of the soil; he brought her all the newest\nbooks; he read aloud the poetry that appeared. Together they went into\necstasies over these poets; she in all sincerity, he with suppressed\nyawns; but he bore with the Romantics with a patience hardly to be\nexpected of a man of the Imperial school, who scarcely could make out\nwhat the young writers meant. Not so Mme. de Bargeton; she waxed\nenthusiastic over the renaissance, due to the return of the Bourbon\nLilies; she loved M. de Chateaubriand for calling Victor Hugo \"a\nsublime child.\" It depressed her that she could only know genius from\nafar, she sighed for Paris, where great men live. For these reasons M.\ndu Chatelet thought he had done a wonderfully clever thing when he\ntold the lady that at that moment in Angouleme there was \"another\nsublime child,\" a young poet, a rising star whose glory surpassed the\nwhole Parisian galaxy, though he knew it not. A great man of the\nfuture had been born in L'Houmeau! The headmaster of the school had\nshown the Baron some admirable verses. The poor and humble lad was a\nsecond Chatterton, with none of the political baseness and ferocious\nhatred of the great ones of earth that led his English prototype to\nturn pamphleteer and revile his benefactors. Mme. de Bargeton in her\nlittle circle of five or six persons, who were supposed to share her\ntastes for art and letters, because this one scraped a fiddle, and\nthat splashed sheets of white paper, more or less, with sepia, and the\nother was president of a local agricultural society, or was gifted\nwith a bass voice that rendered _Se fiato in corpo_ like a war whoop\n--Mme. de Bargeton amid these grotesque figures was like a famished\nactor set down to a stage dinner of pasteboard. No words, therefore,\ncan describe her joy at these tidings. She must see this poet, this\nangel! She raved about him, went into raptures, talked of him for\nwhole hours together. Before two days were out the sometime diplomatic\ncourier had negotiated (through the headmaster) for Lucien's\nappearance in the Hotel de Bargeton.\n\nPoor helots of the provinces, for whom the distances between class and\nclass are so far greater than for the Parisian (for whom, indeed,\nthese distances visibly lessen day by day); souls so grievously\noppressed by the social barriers behind which all sorts and conditions\nof men sit crying _Raca_! with mutual anathemas--you, and you alone,\nwill fully comprehend the ferment in Lucien's heart and brain, when\nhis awe-inspiring headmaster told him that the great gates of the\nHotel de Bargeton would shortly open and turn upon their hinges at his\nfame! Lucien and David, walking together of an evening in the\nPromenade de Beaulieu, had looked up at the house with the\nold-fashioned gables, and wondered whether their names would ever so\nmuch as reach ears inexorably deaf to knowledge that came from a lowly\norigin; and now he (Lucien) was to be made welcome there!\n\nNo one except his sister was in the secret. Eve, like the thrifty\nhousekeeper and divine magician that she was, conjured up a few louis\nd'or from her savings to buy thin shoes for Lucien of the best\nshoemaker in Angouleme, and an entirely new suit of clothes from the\nmost renowned tailor. She made a frill for his best shirt, and washed\nand pleated it with her own hands. And how pleased she was to see him\nso dressed! How proud she felt of her brother, and what quantities of\nadvice she gave him! Her intuition foresaw countless foolish fears.\nLucien had a habit of resting his elbows on the table when he was in\ndeep thought; he would even go so far as to draw a table nearer to\nlean upon it; Eve told him that he must not forget himself in those\naristocratic precincts.\n\nShe went with him as far as St. Peter's Gate, and when they were\nalmost opposite the cathedral she stopped, and watched him pass down\nthe Rue de Beaulieu to the Promenade, where M. du Chatelet was waiting\nfor him. And after he was out of sight, she still stood there, poor\ngirl! in a great tremor of emotion, as though some great thing had\nhappened to them. Lucien in Mme. de Bargeton's house!--for Eve it\nmeant the dawn of success. The innocent creature did not suspect that\nwhere ambition begins, ingenuous feeling ends.\n\nExternals in the Rue du Minage gave Lucien no sense of surprise. This\npalace, that loomed so large in his imagination, was a house built of\nthe soft stone of the country, mellowed by time. It looked dismal\nenough from the street, and inside it was extremely plain; there was\nthe usual provincial courtyard--chilly, prim, and neat; and the house\nitself was sober, almost convent-like, but in good repair.\n\nLucien went up the old staircase with the balustrade of chestnut wood\n(the stone steps ceased after the second floor), crossed a shabby\nantechamber, and came into the presence in a little wainscoted\ndrawing-room, beyond a dimly-lit salon. The carved woodwork, in the\ntaste of the eighteenth century, had been painted gray. There were\nmonochrome paintings on the frieze panels, and the walls were adorned\nwith crimson damask with a meagre border. The old-fashioned furniture\nshrank piteously from sight under covers of a red-and-white check\npattern. On the sofa, covered with thin mattressed cushions, sat Mme.\nde Bargeton; the poet beheld her by the light of two wax candles on a\nsconce with a screen fitted to it, that stood before her on a round\ntable with a green cloth.\n\nThe queen did not attempt to rise, but she twisted very gracefully on\nher seat, smiling on the poet, who was not a little fluttered by the\nserpentine quiverings; her manner was distinguished, he thought. For\nMme. de Bargeton, she was impressed with Lucien's extreme beauty, with\nhis diffidence, with everything about him; for her the poet already\nwas poetry incarnate. Lucien scrutinized his hostess with discreet\nside glances; she disappointed none of his expectations of a great\nlady.\n\nMme. de Bargeton, following a new fashion, wore a coif of slashed\nblack velvet, a head-dress that recalls memories of mediaeval legend\nto a young imagination, to amplify, as it were, the dignity of\nwomanhood. Her red-gold hair, escaping from under her cap, hung loose;\nbright golden color in the light, red in the rounded shadow of the\ncurls that only partially hid her neck. Beneath a massive white brow,\nclean cut and strongly outlined, shone a pair of bright gray eyes\nencircled by a margin of mother-of-pearl, two blue veins on each side\nof the nose bringing out the whiteness of that delicate setting. The\nBourbon curve of the nose added to the ardent expression of an oval\nface; it was as if the royal temper of the House of Conde shone\nconspicuous in this feature. The careless cross-folds of the bodice\nleft a white throat bare, and half revealed the outlines of a still\nyouthful figure and shapely, well placed contours beneath.\n\nWith fingers tapering and well-kept, though somewhat too thin, Mme. de\nBargeton amiably pointed to a seat by her side, M. du Chatelet\nensconced himself in an easy-chair, and Lucien then became aware that\nthere was no one else in the room.\n\nMme. de Bargeton's words intoxicated the young poet from L'Houmeau.\nFor Lucien those three hours spent in her presence went by like a\ndream that we would fain have last forever. She was not thin, he\nthought; she was slender; in love with love, and loverless; and\ndelicate in spite of her strength. Her foibles, exaggerated by her\nmanner, took his fancy; for youth sets out with a love of hyperbole,\nthat infirmity of noble souls. He did not so much as see that her\ncheeks were faded, that the patches of color on the cheek-bone were\nfaded and hardened to a brick-red by listless days and a certain\namount of ailing health. His imagination fastened at once on the\nglowing eyes, on the dainty curls rippling with light, on the dazzling\nfairness of her skin, and hovered about those bright points as the\nmoth hovers about the candle flame. For her spirit made such appeal to\nhis that he could no longer see the woman as she was. Her feminine\nexaltation had carried him away, the energy of her expressions, a\nlittle staled in truth by pretty hard and constant wear, but new to\nLucien, fascinated him so much the more easily because he was\ndetermined to be pleased. He had brought none of his own verses to\nread, but nothing was said of them; he had purposely left them behind\nbecause he meant to return; and Mme. de Bargeton did not ask for them,\nbecause she meant that he should come back some future day to read\nthem to her. Was not this a beginning of an understanding?\n\nAs for M. Sixte du Chatelet, he was not over well pleased with all\nthis. He perceived rather too late in the day that he had a rival in\nthis handsome young fellow. He went with him as far as the first\nflight of steps below Beaulieu to try the effect of a little\ndiplomacy; and Lucien was not a little astonished when he heard  the\ncontroller of excise pluming himself on having effected the\nintroduction, and proceeding in this character to give him (Lucien)\nthe benefit of his advice.\n\n\"Heaven send that Lucien might meet with better treatment than he had\ndone,\" such was the matter of M. du Chatelet's discourse. \"The Court\nwas less insolent that this pack of dolts in Angouleme. You were\nexpected to endure deadly insults; the superciliousness you had to put\nup with was something abominable. If this kind of folk did not alter\ntheir behavior, there would be another Revolution of '89. As for\nhimself, if he continued to go to the house, it was because he had\nfound Mme. de Bargeton to his taste; she was the only woman worth\ntroubling about in Angouleme; he had been paying court to her for want\nof anything better to do, and now he was desperately in love with her.\nShe would be his before very long, she loved him, everything pointed\nthat way. The conquest of this haughty queen of the society would be\nhis one revenge on the whole houseful of booby clodpates.\"\n\nChatelet talked of his passion in the tone of a man who would have a\nrival's life if he crossed his path. The elderly butterfly of the\nEmpire came down with his whole weight on the poor poet, and tried to\nfrighten and crush him by his self-importance. He grew taller as he\ngave an embellished account of his perilous wanderings; but while he\nimpressed the poet's imagination, the lover was by no means afraid of\nhim.\n\nIn spite of the elderly coxcomb, and regardless of his threats and\nairs of a _bourgeois_ bravo, Lucien went back again and again to the\nhouse--not too often at first, as became a man of L'Houmeau; but\nbefore very long he grew accustomed to the vast condescension, as it\nhad seemed to him at the outset, and came more and more frequently.\nThe druggist's son was a completely insignificant being. If any of the\n_noblesse_, men or women, calling upon Nais, found Lucien in the room,\nthey met him with the overwhelming graciousness that well-bred people\nuse towards their inferiors. Lucien thought them very kind for a time,\nand later found out the real reason for their specious amiability. It\nwas not long before he detected a patronizing tone that stirred his\ngall and confirmed him in his bitter Republicanism, a phase of opinion\nthrough which many a would-be patrician passes by way of prelude to\nhis introduction to polite society.\n\nBut was there anything that he would not have endured for Nais?--for\nso he heard her named by the clan. Like Spanish grandees and the old\nAustrian nobility at Vienna, these folk, men and women alike, called\neach other by their Christian names, a final shade of distinction in\nthe inmost ring of Angoumoisin aristocracy.\n\nLucien loved Nais as a young man loves the first woman who flatters\nhim, for Nais prophesied great things and boundless fame for Lucien.\nShe used all her skill to secure her hold upon her poet; not merely\ndid she exalt him beyond measure, but she represented him to himself\nas a child without fortune whom she meant to start in life; she\ntreated him like a child, to keep him near her; she made him her\nreader, her secretary, and cared more for him than she would have\nthought possible after the dreadful calamity that had befallen her.\n\nShe was very cruel to herself in those days, telling herself that it\nwould be folly to love a young man of twenty, so far apart from her\nsocially in the first place; and her behavior to him was a bewildering\nmixture of familiarity and capricious fits of pride arising from her\nfears and scruples. She was sometimes a lofty patroness, sometimes she\nwas tender and flattered him. At first, while he was overawed by her\nrank, Lucien experienced the extremes of dread, hope, and despair, the\ntorture of a first love, that is beaten deep into the heart with the\nhammer strokes of alternate bliss and anguish. For two months Mme. de\nBargeton was for him a benefactress who would take a mother's interest\nin him; but confidences came next. Mme. de Bargeton began to address\nher poet as \"dear Lucien,\" and then as \"dear,\" without more ado. The\npoet grew bolder, and addressed the great lady as Nais, and there\nfollowed a flash of anger that captivates a boy; she reproached him\nfor calling her by a name in everybody's mouth. The haughty and\nhigh-born Negrepelisse offered the fair angel youth that one of her\nappellations which was unsoiled by use; for him she would be \"Louise.\"\nLucien was in the third heaven.\n\nOne evening when Lucien came in, he found Mme. de Bargeton looking at\na portrait, which she promptly put away. He wished to see it, and to\nquiet the despair of a first fit of jealousy Louise showed him\nCante-Croix's picture, and told with tears the piteous story of a love\nso stainless, so cruelly cut short. Was she experimenting with herself?\nWas she trying a first unfaithfulness to the memory of the dead? Or\nhad she taken it into her head to raise up a rival to Lucien in the\nportrait? Lucien was too much of a boy to analyze his lady-love; he\ngave way to unfeigned despair when she opened the campaign by\nentrenching herself behind the more or less skilfully devised scruples\nwhich women raise to have them battered down. When a woman begins to\ntalk about her duty, regard for appearances or religion, the\nobjections she raises are so many redoubts which she loves to have\ncarried by storm. But on the guileless Lucien these coquetries were\nthrown away; he would have advanced of his own accord.\n\n\"_I_ shall not die for you, I will live for you,\" he cried audaciously\none evening; he meant to have no more of M. de Cante-Croix, and gave\nLouise a glance which told plainly that a crisis was at hand.\n\nStartled at the progress of this new love in herself and her poet,\nLouise demanded some verses promised for the first page of her album,\nlooking for a pretext for a quarrel in his tardiness. But what became\nof her when she read the following stanzas, which, naturally, she\nconsidered finer than the finest work of Canalis, the poet of the\naristocracy?--\n\n  The magic brush, light flying flights of song--\n  To these, but not to these alone, belong\n    My pages fair;\n  Often to me, my mistress' pencil steals\n  To tell the secret gladness that she feels,\n    The hidden care.\n\n  And when her fingers, slowlier at the last,\n  Of a rich Future, now become the Past,\n    Seek count of me,\n  Oh Love, when swift, thick-coming memories rise,\n    I pray of Thee.\n  May they bring visions fair as cloudless skies\n  Of happy voyage o'er a summer sea!\n\n\"Was it really I who inspired those lines?\" she asked.\n\nThe doubt suggested by coquetry to a woman who amused herself by\nplaying with fire brought tears to Lucien's eyes; but her first kiss\nupon his forehead calmed the storm. Decidedly Lucien was a great man,\nand she meant to form him; she thought of teaching him Italian and\nGerman and perfecting his manners. That would be pretext sufficient\nfor having him constantly with her under the very eyes of her tiresome\ncourtiers. What an interest in her life! She took up music again for\nher poet's sake, and revealed the world of sound to him, playing grand\nfragments of Beethoven till she sent him into ecstasy; and, happy in\nhis delight, turned to the half-swooning poet.\n\n\"Is not such happiness as this enough?\" she asked hypocritically; and\npoor Lucien was stupid enough to answer, \"Yes.\"\n\nIn the previous week things had reached such a point, that Louise had\njudged it expedient to ask Lucien to dine with M. de Bargeton as a\nthird. But in spite of this precaution, the whole town knew the state\nof affairs; and so extraordinary did it appear, that no one would\nbelieve the truth. The outcry was terrific. Some were of the opinion\nthat society was on the eve of cataclysm. \"See what comes of Liberal\ndoctrines!\" cried others.\n\nThen it was that the jealous du Chatelet discovered that Madame\nCharlotte, the monthly nurse, was no other than Mme. Chardon, \"the\nmother of the Chateaubriand of L'Houmeau,\" as he put it. The remark\npassed muster as a joke. Mme. de Chandour was the first to hurry to\nMme. de Bargeton.\n\n\"Nais, dear,\" she said, \"do you know what everybody is talking about\nin Angouleme? This little rhymster's mother is the Madame Charlotte\nwho nursed my sister-in-law through her confinement two months ago.\"\n\n\"What is there extraordinary in that, my dear?\" asked Mme. de Bargeton\nwith her most regal air. \"She is a druggist's widow, is she not? A\npoor fate for a Rubempre. Suppose that you and I had not a penny in\nthe world, what should either of us do for a living? How would you\nsupport your children?\"\n\nMme. de Bargeton's presence of mind put an end to the jeremiads of the\n_noblesse_. Great natures are prone to make a virtue of misfortune; and\nthere is something irresistibly attractive about well-doing when\npersisted in through evil report; innocence has the piquancy of the\nforbidden.\n\nMme. de Bargeton's rooms were crowded that evening with friends who\ncame to remonstrate with her. She brought her most caustic wit into\nplay. She said that as noble families could not produce a Moliere, a\nRacine, a Rousseau, a Voltaire, a Massillon, a Beaumarchais, or a\nDiderot, people must make up their minds to it, and accept the fact\nthat great men had upholsterers and clockmakers and cutlers for their\nfathers. She said that genius was always noble. She railed at boorish\nsquires for understanding their real interests so imperfectly. In\nshort, she talked a good deal of nonsense, which would have let the\nlight into heads less dense, but left her audience agape at her\neccentricity. And in these ways she conjured away the storm with her\nheavy artillery.\n\nWhen Lucien, obedient to her request, appeared for the first time in\nthe faded great drawing-room, where the whist-tables were set out, she\nwelcomed him graciously, and brought him forward, like a queen who\nmeans to be obeyed. She addressed the controller of excise as \"M.\nChatelet,\" and left that gentleman thunderstruck by the discovery that\nshe knew about the illegal superfetation of the particle. Lucien was\nforced upon her circle, and was received as a poisonous element, which\nevery person in it vowed to expel with the antidote of insolence.\n\nNais had won a victory, but she had lost her supremacy of empire.\nThere was a rumor of insurrection. Amelie, otherwise Mme. de Chandour,\nharkening to \"M. Chatelet's\" counsels, determined to erect a rival\naltar by receiving on Wednesdays. Now Mme. de Bargeton's salon was\nopen every evening; and those who frequented it were so wedded to\ntheir ways, so accustomed to meet about the same tables, to play the\nfamiliar game of backgammon, to see the same faces and the same candle\nsconces night after night; and afterwards to cloak and shawl, and put\non overshoes and hats in the old corridor, that they were quite as\nmuch attached to the steps of the staircase as to the mistress of the\nhouse.\n\n\"All resigned themselves to endure the songster\" (_chardonneret_) \"of\nthe sacred grove,\" said Alexandre de Brebian, which was witticism\nnumber two. Finally, the president of the agricultural society put an\nend to the sedition by remarking judicially that \"before the\nRevolution the greatest nobles admitted men like Dulcos and Grimm and\nCrebillon to their society--men who were nobodies, like this little\npoet of L'Houmeau; but one thing they never did, they never received\ntax-collectors, and, after all, Chatelet is only a tax-collector.\"\n\nDu Chatelet suffered for Chardon. Every one turned the cold shoulder\nupon him; and Chatelet was conscious that he was attacked. When Mme.\nde Bargeton called him \"M. Chatelet,\" he swore to himself that he\nwould possess her; and now he entered into the views of the mistress\nof the house, came to the support of the young poet, and declared\nhimself Lucien's friend. The great diplomatist, overlooked by the\nshortsighted Emperor, made much of Lucien, and declared himself his\nfriend! To launch the poet into society, he gave a dinner, and asked\nall the authorities to meet him--the prefect, the receiver-general,\nthe colonel in command of the garrison, the head of the Naval School,\nthe president of the Court, and so forth. The poet, poor fellow, was\nfeted so magnificently, and so belauded, that anybody but a young man\nof two-and-twenty would have shrewdly suspected a hoax. After dinner,\nChatelet drew his rival on to recite _The Dying Sardanapalus_, the\nmasterpiece of the hour; and the headmaster of the school, a man of a\nphlegmatic temperament, applauded with both hands, and vowed that\nJean-Baptiste Rousseau had done nothing finer. Sixte, Baron du\nChatelet, thought in his heart that this slip of a rhymster would\nwither incontinently in a hothouse of adulation; perhaps he hoped that\nwhen the poet's head was turned with brilliant dreams, he would\nindulge in some impertinence that would promptly consign him to the\nobscurity from which he had emerged. Pending the decease of genius,\nChatelet appeared to offer up his hopes as a sacrifice at Mme. de\nBargeton's feet; but with the ingenuity of a rake, he kept his own\nplan in abeyance, watching the lovers' movements with keenly critical\neyes, and waiting for the opportunity of ruining Lucien.\n\nFrom this time forward, vague rumors reported the existence of a great\nman in Angoumois. Mme. de Bargeton was praised on all sides for the\ninterest which she took in this young eagle. No sooner was her conduct\napproved than she tried to win a general sanction. She announced a\nsoiree, with ices, tea, and cakes, a great innovation in a city where\ntea, as yet, was sold only by druggists as a remedy for indigestion.\nThe flower of Angoumoisin aristocracy was summoned to hear Lucien read\nhis great work. Louise had hidden all the difficulties from her\nfriend, but she let fall a few words touching the social cabal formed\nagainst him; she would not have him ignorant of the perils besetting\nhis career as a man of genius, nor of the obstacles insurmountable to\nweaklings. She drew a lesson from the recent victory. Her white hands\npointed him to glory that lay beyond a prolonged martyrdom; she spoke\nof stakes and flaming pyres; she spread the adjectives thickly on her\nfinest _tartines_, and decorated them with a variety of her most pompous\nepithets. It was an infringement of the copyright of the passages of\ndeclamation that disfigure _Corinne_; but Louise grew so much the\ngreater in her own eyes as she talked, that she loved the Benjamin who\ninspired her eloquence the more for it. She counseled him to take a\nbold step and renounce his patronymic for the noble name of Rubempre;\nhe need not mind the little tittle-tattle over a change which the\nKing, for that matter, would authorize. Mme. de Bargeton undertook to\nprocure this favor; she was related to the Marquise d'Espard, who was\na Blamont-Chauvry before her marriage, and a _persona grata_ at Court.\nThe words \"King,\" \"Marquise d'Espard,\" and \"the Court\" dazzled Lucien\nlike a blaze of fireworks, and the necessity of the baptism was plain\nto him.\n\n\"Dear child,\" said Louise, with tender mockery in her tones, \"the\nsooner it is done, the sooner it will be sanctioned.\"\n\nShe went through social strata and showed the poet that this step\nwould raise him many rungs higher in the ladder. Seizing the moment,\nshe persuaded Lucien to forswear the chimerical notions of '89 as to\nequality; she roused a thirst for social distinction allayed by\nDavid's cool commonsense; she pointed out fashionable society as the\ngoal and the only stage for such a talent as his. The rabid Liberal\nbecame a Monarchist _in petto_; Lucien set his teeth in the apple of\ndesire of rank, luxury, and fame. He swore to win a crown to lay at\nhis lady's feet, even if there should be blood-stains on the bays. He\nwould conquer at any cost, _quibuscumque viis_. To prove his courage, he\ntold her of his present way of life; Louise had known nothing of its\nhardships, for there is an indefinable pudency inseparable from strong\nfeeling in youth, a delicacy which shrinks from a display of great\nqualities; and a young man loves to have the real quality of his\nnature discerned through the incognito. He described that life, the\nshackles of poverty borne with pride, his days of work for David, his\nnights of study. His young ardor recalled memories of the colonel of\nsix-and-twenty; Mme. de Bargeton's eyes grew soft; and Lucien, seeing\nthis weakness in his awe-inspiring mistress, seized a hand that she\nhad abandoned to him, and kissed it with the frenzy of a lover and a\npoet in his youth. Louise even allowed him to set his eager, quivering\nlips upon her forehead.\n\n\"Oh, child! child! if any one should see us, I should look very\nridiculous,\" she said, shaking off the ecstatic torpor.\n\nIn the course of that evening, Mme. de Bargeton's wit made havoc of\nLucien's prejudices, as she styled them. Men of genius, according to\nher doctrine, had neither brothers nor sisters nor father nor mother;\nthe great tasks laid upon them required that they should sacrifice\neverything that they might grow to their full stature. Perhaps their\nfamilies might suffer at first from the all-absorbing exactions of a\ngiant brain, but at a later day they were repaid a hundredfold for\nself-denial of every kind during the early struggles of the kingly\nintellect with adverse fate; they shared the spoils of victory. Genius\nwas answerable to no man. Genius alone could judge of the means used\nto an end which no one else could know. It was the duty of a man of\ngenius, therefore, to set himself above law; it was his mission to\nreconstruct law; the man who is master of his age may take all that he\nneeds, run any risks, for all is his. She quoted instances. Bernard\nPalissy, Louis XI., Fox, Napoleon, Christopher Columbus, and Julius\nCaesar,--all these world-famous gamblers had begun life hampered with\ndebt, or as poor men; all of them had been misunderstood, taken for\nmadmen, reviled for bad sons, bad brothers, bad fathers; and yet in\nafter life each one had come to be the pride of his family, of his\ncountry, of the civilized world.\n\nHer arguments fell upon fertile soil in the worst of Lucien's nature,\nand spread corruption in his heart; for him, when his desires were\nhot, all means were admissible. But--failure is high treason against\nsociety; and when the fallen conqueror has run amuck through _bourgeois_\nvirtues, and pulled down the pillars of society, small wonder that\nsociety, finding Marius seated among the ruins, should drive him forth\nin abhorrence. All unconsciously Lucien stood with the palm of genius\non the one hand and a shameful ending in the hulks upon the other;\nand, on high upon the Sinai of the prophets, beheld no Dead Sea\ncovering the cities of the plain--the hideous winding-sheet of\nGomorrah.\n\nSo well did Louise loosen the swaddling-bands of provincial life that\nconfined the heart and brain of her poet that the said poet determined\nto try an experiment upon her. He wished to feel certain that this\nproud conquest was his without laying himself open to the\nmortification of a rebuff. The forthcoming soiree gave him his\nopportunity. Ambition blended with his love. He loved, and he meant to\nrise, a double desire not unnatural in young men with a heart to\nsatisfy and the battle of life to fight. Society, summoning all her\nchildren to one banquet, arouses ambition in the very morning of life.\nYouth is robbed of its charm, and generous thoughts are corrupted by\nmercenary scheming. The idealist would fain have it otherwise, but\nintrusive fact too often gives the lie to the fiction which we should\nlike to believe, making it impossible to paint the young man of the\nnineteenth century other than he is. Lucien imagined that his scheming\nwas entirely prompted by good feeling, and persuaded himself that it\nwas done solely for his friend David's sake.\n\nHe wrote a long letter to his Louise; he felt bolder, pen in hand,\nthan face to face. In a dozen sheets, copied out three several times,\nhe told her of his father's genius and blighted hopes and of his\ngrinding poverty. He described his beloved sister as an angel, and\nDavid as another Cuvier, a great man of the future, and a father,\nfriend, and brother to him in the present. He should feel himself\nunworthy of his Louise's love (his proudest distinction) if he did not\nask her to do for David all that she had done for him. He would give\nup everything rather than desert David Sechard; David must witness his\nsuccess. It was one of those wild letters in which a young man points\na pistol at a refusal, letters full of boyish casuistry and the\nincoherent reasoning of an idealist; a delicious tissue of words\nembroidered here and there by the naive utterances that women love so\nwell--unconscious revelations of the writer's heart.\n\nLucien left the letter with the housemaid, went to the office, and\nspent the day in reading proofs, superintending the execution of\norders, and looking after the affairs of the printing-house. He said\nnot a word to David. While youth bears a child's heart, it is capable\nof sublime reticence. Perhaps, too, Lucien began to dread the\nPhocion's axe which David could wield when he chose, perhaps he was\nafraid to meet those clear-sighted eyes that read the depths of his\nsoul. But when he read Chenier's poems with David, his secret rose\nfrom his heart to his lips at the sting of a reproach that he felt as\nthe patient feels the probing of a wound.\n\n\n\nAnd now try to understand the thoughts that troubled Lucien's mind as\nhe went down from Angouleme. Was the great lady angry with him? Would\nshe receive David? Had he, Lucien, in his ambition, flung himself\nheadlong back into the depths of L'Houmeau? Before he set that kiss on\nLouise's forehead, he had had time to measure the distance between a\nqueen and her favorite, so far had he come in five months, and he did\nnot tell himself that David could cross over the same ground in a\nmoment. Yet he did not know how completely the lower orders were\nexcluded from this upper world; he did not so much as suspect that a\nsecond experiment of this kind meant ruin for Mme. de Bargeton. Once\naccused and fairly convicted of a liking for _canaille_, Louise would be\ndriven from the place, her caste would shun her as men shunned a leper\nin the Middle Ages. Nais might have broken the moral law, and her\nwhole circle, the clergy and the flower of the aristocracy, would have\ndefended her against the world through thick and then; but a breach of\nanother law, the offence of admitting all sorts of people to her house\n--this was sin without remission. The sins of those in power are\nalways overlooked--once let them abdicate, and they shall pay the\npenalty. And what was it but abdication to receive David?\n\nBut if Lucien did not see these aspects of the question, his\naristocratic instinct discerned plenty of difficulties of another\nkind, and he took alarm. A fine manner is not the invariable outcome\nof noble feeling; and while no man at court had a nobler air than\nRacine, Corneille looked very much like a cattle-dealer, and Descartes\nmight have been taken for an honest Dutch merchant; and visitors to La\nBrede, meeting Montesquieu in a cotton nightcap, carrying a rake over\nhis shoulder, mistook him for a gardener. A knowledge of the world,\nwhen it is not sucked in with mother's milk and part of the\ninheritance of descent, is only acquired by education, supplemented by\ncertain gifts of chance--a graceful figure, distinction of feature, a\ncertain ring in the voice. All these, so important trifles, David\nlacked, while Nature had bestowed them upon his friend. Of gentle\nblood on the mother's side, Lucien was a Frank, even down to the\nhigh-arched instep. David had inherited the physique of his father the\npressman and the flat foot of the Gael. Lucien could hear the shower\nof jokes at David's expense; he could see Mme. de Bargeton's repressed\nsmile; and at length, without being exactly ashamed of his brother, he\nmade up his mind to disregard his first impulse and to think twice\nbefore yielding to it in future.\n\nSo, after the hour of poetry and self-sacrifice, after the reading of\nverse that opened out before the friends the fields of literature in\nthe light of a newly-risen sun, the hour of worldly wisdom and of\nscheming struck for Lucien.\n\nDown once more in L'Houmeau he wished that he had not written that\nletter; he wished he could have it back again; for down the vista of\nthe future he caught a glimpse of the inexorable laws of the world. He\nguessed that nothing succeeds like success, and it cost him something\nto step down from the first rung of the scaling ladder by which he\nmeant to reach and storm the heights above. Pictures of his quiet and\nsimple life rose before him, pictures fair with the brightest colors\nof blossoming love. There was David; what a genius David had--David\nwho had helped him so generously, and would die for him at need; he\nthought of his mother, of how great a lady she was in her lowly lot,\nand how she thought that he was as good as he was clever; then of his\nsister so gracious in submission to her fate, of his own innocent\nchildhood and conscience as yet unstained, of budding hopes\nundespoiled by rough winds, and at these thoughts the past broke into\nflowers once more for his memory.\n\nThen he told himself that it was a far finer thing to hew his own way\nthrough serried hostile mobs of aristocrats or philistines by repeated\nsuccessful strokes, than to reach the goal through a woman's favor.\nSooner or later his genius should shine out; it had been so with the\nothers, his predecessors; they had tamed society. Women would love him\nwhen that day came! The example of Napoleon, which, unluckily for this\nnineteenth century of ours, has filled a great many ordinary persons\nwith aspirations after extraordinary destinies,--the example of\nNapoleon occurred to Lucien's mind. He flung his schemes to the winds\nand blamed himself for thinking of them. For Lucien was so made that\nhe went from evil to good, or from good to evil, with the same\nfacility.\n\nLucien had none of the scholar's love for his retreat; for the past\nmonth indeed he had felt something like shame at the sight of the shop\nfront, where you could read--\n\n           POSTEL (LATE CHARDON), PHARMACEUTICAL CHEMIST,\n\nin yellow letters on a green ground. It was an offence to him that his\nfather's name should be thus posted up in a place where every carriage\npassed.\n\nEvery evening, when he closed the ugly iron gate and went up to\nBeaulieu to give his arm to Mme. de Bargeton among the dandies of the\nupper town, he chafed beyond all reason at the disparity between his\nlodging and his fortune.\n\n\"I love Mme. de Bargeton; perhaps in a few days she will be mine, yet\nhere I live in this rat-hole!\" he said to himself this evening, as he\nwent down the narrow passage into the little yard behind the shop.\nThis evening bundles of boiled herbs were spread out along the wall,\nthe apprentice was scouring a caldron, and M. Postel himself, girded\nabout with his laboratory apron, was standing with a retort in his\nhand, inspecting some chemical product while keeping an eye upon the\nshop door, or if the eye happened to be engaged, he had at any rate an\near for the bell.\n\nA strong scent of camomile and peppermint pervaded the yard and the\npoor little dwelling at the side, which you reached by a short ladder,\nwith a rope on either side by way of hand-rail. Lucien's room was an\nattic just under the roof.\n\n\"Good-day, sonny,\" said M. Postel, that typical, provincial tradesman.\n\"Are you pretty middling? I have just been experimenting on treacle,\nbut it would take a man like your father to find what I am looking\nfor. Ah! he was a famous chemist, he was! If I had only known his gout\nspecific, you and I should be rolling along in our carriage this day.\"\n\nThe little druggist, whose head was as thick as his heart was kind,\nnever let a week pass without some allusion to Chardon senior's\nunlucky secretiveness as to that discovery, words that Lucien felt\nlike a stab.\n\n\"It is a great pity,\" Lucien answered curtly. He was beginning to\nthink his father's apprentice prodigiously vulgar, though he had\nblessed the man for his kindness, for honest Postel had helped his\nmaster's widow and children more than once.\n\n\"Why, what is the matter with you?\" M. Postel inquired, putting down\nhis test tube on the laboratory table.\n\n\"Is there a letter for me?\"\n\n\"Yes, a letter that smells like balm! it is lying on the corner near\nmy desk.\"\n\nMme. de Bargeton's letter lying among the physic bottles in a\ndruggist's shop! Lucien sprang in to rescue it.\n\n\"Be quick, Lucien! your dinner has been waiting an hour for you, it\nwill be cold!\" a sweet voice called gently through a half-opened\nwindow; but Lucien did not hear.\n\n\"That brother of yours has gone crazy, mademoiselle,\" said Postel,\nlifting his face.\n\nThe old bachelor looked rather like a miniature brandy cask,\nembellished by a painter's fancy, with a fat, ruddy countenance much\npitted with the smallpox; at the sight of Eve his face took a\nceremonious and amiable expression, which said plainly that he had\nthoughts of espousing the daughter of his predecessor, but could not\nput an end to the strife between love and interest in his heart. He\noften said to Lucien, with a smile, \"Your sister is uncommonly pretty,\nand you are not so bad looking neither! Your father did everything\nwell.\"\n\nEve was tall, dark-haired, dark of complexion, and blue-eyed; but\nnotwithstanding these signs of virile character, she was gentle,\ntender-hearted, and devoted to those she loved. Her frank innocence,\nher simplicity, her quiet acceptance of a hard-working life, her\ncharacter--for her life was above reproach--could not fail to win\nDavid Sechard's heart. So, since the first time that these two had\nmet, a repressed and single-hearted love had grown up between them in\nthe German fashion, quietly, with no fervid protestations. In their\nsecret souls they thought of each other as if there were a bar between\nthat kept them apart; as if the thought were an offence against some\njealous husband; and hid their feelings from Lucien as though their\nlove in some way did him a wrong. David, moreover, had no confidence\nin himself, and could not believe that Eve could care for him; Eve was\na penniless girl, and therefore shy. A real work-girl would have been\nbolder; but Eve, gently bred, and fallen into poverty, resigned\nherself to her dreary lot. Diffident as she seemed, she was in reality\nproud, and would not make a single advance towards the son of a father\nsaid to be rich. People who knew the value of a growing property, said\nthat the vineyard at Marsac was worth more than eighty thousand\nfrancs, to say nothing of the traditional bits of land which old\nSechard used to buy as they came into the market, for old Sechard had\nsavings--he was lucky with his vintages, and a clever salesman.\nPerhaps David was the only man in Angouleme who knew nothing of his\nfather's wealth. In David's eyes Marsac was a hovel bought in 1810 for\nfifteen or sixteen thousand francs, a place that he saw once a year at\nvintage time when his father walked him up and down among the vines\nand boasted of an output of wine which the young printer never saw,\nand he cared nothing about it.\n\nDavid was a student leading a solitary life; and the love that gained\neven greater force in solitude, as he dwelt upon the difficulties in\nthe way, was timid, and looked for encouragement; for David stood more\nin awe of Eve than a simple clerk of some high-born lady. He was\nawkward and ill at ease in the presence of his idol, and as eager to\nhurry away as he had been to come. He repressed his passion, and was\nsilent. Often of an evening, on some pretext of consulting Lucien, he\nwould leave the Place du Murier and go down through the Palet Gate as\nfar as L'Houmeau, but at the sight of the green iron railings his\nheart failed. Perhaps he had come too late, Eve might think him a\nnuisance; she would be in bed by this time no doubt; and so he turned\nback. But though his great love had only appeared in trifles, Eve read\nit clearly; she was proud, without a touch of vanity in her pride, of\nthe deep reverence in David's looks and words and manner towards her,\nbut it was the young printer's enthusiastic belief in Lucien that drew\nher to him most of all. He had divined the way to win Eve. The mute\ndelights of this love of theirs differed from the transports of stormy\npassion, as wildflowers in the fields from the brilliant flowers in\ngarden beds. Interchange of glances, delicate and sweet as blue\nwater-flowers on the surface of the stream; a look in either face,\nvanishing as swiftly as the scent of briar-rose; melancholy, tender as\nthe velvet of moss--these were the blossoms of two rare natures,\nspringing up out of a rich and fruitful soil on foundations of rock.\nMany a time Eve had seen revelations of the strength that lay below\nthe appearance of weakness, and made such full allowance for all that\nDavid left undone, that the slightest word now might bring about a\ncloser union of soul and soul.\n\nEve opened the door, and Lucien sat down without a word at the little\ntable on an X-shaped trestle. There was no tablecloth; the poor little\nhousehold boasted but three silver spoons and forks, and Eve had laid\nthem all for the dearly loved brother.\n\n\"What have you there?\" she asked, when she had set a dish on the\ntable, and put the extinguisher on the portable stove, where it had\nbeen kept hot for him.\n\nLucien did not answer. Eve took up a little plate, daintily garnished\nwith vine-leaves, and set it on the table with a jug full of cream.\n\n\"There, Lucien, I have had strawberries for you.\"\n\nBut Lucien was so absorbed in his letter that he did not hear a word.\nEve came to sit beside him without a murmur; for in a sister's love\nfor a brother it is an element of great pleasure to be treated without\nceremony.\n\n\"Oh! what is it?\" she cried as she saw tears shining in her brother's\neyes.\n\n\"Nothing, nothing, Eve,\" he said, and putting his arm about her waist,\nhe drew her towards him and kissed her forehead, her hair, her throat,\nwith warmth that surprised her.\n\n\"You are keeping something from me.\"\n\n\"Well, then--she loves me.\"\n\n\"I knew very well that you kissed me for somebody else,\" the poor\nsister pouted, flushing red.\n\n\"We shall all be happy,\" cried Lucien, swallowing great spoonfuls of\nsoup.\n\n\"_We_?\" echoed Eve. The same presentiment that had crossed David's mind\nprompted her to add, \"You will not care so much about us now.\"\n\n\"How can you think that, if you know me?\"\n\nEve put out her hand and grasped his tightly; then she carried off the\nempty plate and the brown earthen soup-tureen, and brought the dish\nthat she had made for him. But instead of eating his dinner, Lucien\nread his letter over again; and Eve, discreet maiden, did not ask\nanother question, respecting her brother's silence. If he wished to\ntell her about it, she could wait; if he did not, how could she ask\nhim to tell her? She waited. Here is the letter:--\n\n\n  \"MY FRIEND,--Why should I refuse to your brother in science the\n  help that I have lent you? All merits have equal rights in my\n  eyes; but you do not know the prejudices of those among whom I\n  live. We shall never make an aristocracy of ignorance understand\n  that intellect ennobles. If I have not sufficient influence to\n  compel them to accept M. David Sechard, I am quite willing to\n  sacrifice the worthless creatures to you. It would be a perfect\n  hecatomb in the antique manner. But, dear friend, you would not,\n  of course, ask me to leave them all in exchange for the society of\n  a person whose character and manner might not please me. I know\n  from your flatteries how easily friendship can be blinded. Will\n  you think the worse of me if I attach a condition to my consent?\n  In the interests of your future I should like to see your friend,\n  and know and decide for myself whether you are not mistaken. What\n  is this but the mother's anxious care of my dear poet, which I am\n  in duty bound to take?\n\n                                       \"LOUISE DE NEGREPELISSE.\"\n\n\nLucien had no suspicion of the art with which polite society puts\nforward a \"Yes\" on the way to a \"No,\" and a \"No\" that leads to a\n\"Yes.\" He took this note for a victory. David should go to Mme. de\nBargeton's house! David would shine there in all the majesty of his\ngenius! He raised his head so proudly in the intoxication of a victory\nwhich increased his belief in himself and his ascendency over others,\nhis face was so radiant with the brightness of many hopes, that his\nsister could not help telling him that he looked handsome.\n\n\"If that woman has any sense, she must love you! And if so, to-night\nshe will be vexed, for all the ladies will try all sorts of coquetries\non you. How handsome you will look when you read your _Saint John in\nPatmos_! If only I were a mouse, and could just slip in and see it!\nCome, I have put your clothes out in mother's room.\"\n\nThe mother's room bore witness to self-respecting poverty. There were\nwhite curtains to the walnut wood bedstead, and a strip of cheap green\ncarpet at the foot. A chest of drawers with a wooden top, a\nlooking-glass, and a few walnut wood chairs completed the furniture.\nThe clock on the chimney-piece told of the old vanished days of\nprosperity. White curtains hung in the windows, a gray flowered paper\ncovered the walls, and the tiled floor, colored and waxed by Eve\nherself, shone with cleanliness. On the little round table in the\nmiddle of the room stood a red tray with a pattern of gilt roses, and\nthree cups and a sugar-basin of Limoges porcelain. Eve slept in the\nlittle adjoining closet, where there was just room for a narrow bed,\nan old-fashioned low chair, and a work-table by the window; there was\nabout as much space as there is in a ship's cabin, and the door always\nstood open for the sake of air. But if all these things spoke of great\npoverty, the atmosphere was sedate and studious; and for those who knew\nthe mother and children, there was something touchingly appropriate in\ntheir surroundings.\n\nLucien was tying his cravat when David's step sounded outside in the\nlittle yard, and in another moment the young printer appeared. From\nhis manner and looks he seemed to have come down in a hurry.\n\n\"Well, David!\" cried the ambitious poet, \"we have gained the day! She\nloves me! You shall come too.\"\n\n\"No,\" David said with some confusion, \"I came down to thank you for\nthis proof of friendship, but I have been thinking things over\nseriously. My own life is cut out for me, Lucien. I am David Sechard,\nprinter to His Majesty in Angouleme, with my name at the bottom of the\nbills posted on every wall. For people of that class, I am an artisan,\nor I am in business, if you like it better, but I am a craftsman who\nlives over a shop in the Rue de Beaulieu at the corner of the Place du\nMurier. I have not the wealth of a Keller just yet, nor the name of a\nDesplein, two sorts of power that the nobles still try to ignore, and\n--I am so far agreed with them--this power is nothing without a\nknowledge of the world and the manners of a gentleman. How am I to\nprove my claim to this sudden elevation? I should only make myself a\nlaughing-stock for nobles and _bourgeoisie_ to boot. As for you, your\nposition is different. A foreman is not committed to anything. You are\nbusy gaining knowledge that will be indispensable by and by; you can\nexplain your present work by your future. And, in any case, you can\nleave your place to-morrow and begin something else; you might study\nlaw or diplomacy, or go into civil service. Nobody had docketed and\npigeon-holed _you_, in fact. Take advantage of your social maiden fame\nto walk alone and grasp honors. Enjoy all pleasures gladly, even\nfrivolous pleasures. I wish you luck, Lucien; I shall enjoy your\nsuccess; you will be like a second self for me. Yes, in my own\nthoughts I shall live your life. You shall have the holiday life, in\nthe glare of the world and among the swift working springs of\nintrigue. I will lead the work-a-day life, the tradesman's life of\nsober toil, and the patient labor of scientific research.\n\n\"You shall be our aristocracy,\" he went on, looking at Eve as he\nspoke. \"If you totter, you shall have my arm to steady you. If you\nhave reason to complain of the treachery of others, you will find a\nrefuge in our hearts, the love there will never change. And influence\nand favor and the goodwill of others might fail us if we were two; we\nshould stand in each other's way; go forward, you can tow me after you\nif it comes to that. So far from envying you, I will dedicate my life\nto yours. The thing that you have just done for me, when you risked\nthe loss of your benefactress, your love it may be, rather than\nforsake or disown me, that little thing, so great as it was--ah, well,\nLucien, that in itself would bind me to you forever if we were not\nbrothers already. Have no remorse, no concern over seeming to take the\nlarger share. This one-sided bargain is exactly to my taste. And,\nafter all, suppose that you should give me a pang now and again, who\nknows that I shall not still be your debtor all my life long?\"\n\nHe looked timidly towards Eve as he spoke; her eyes were full of\ntears, she saw all that lay below the surface.\n\n\"In fact,\" he went on, turning to Lucien, who stood amazed at this,\n\"you are well made, you have a graceful figure, you wear your clothes\nwith an air, you look like a gentleman in that blue coat of yours with\nthe yellow buttons and the plain nankeen trousers; now I should look\nlike a workingman among those people, I should be awkward and out of\nmy element, I should say foolish things, or say nothing at all; but as\nfor you, you can overcome any prejudice as to names by taking your\nmother's; you can call yourself Lucien de Rubempre; I am and always\nshall be David Sechard. In this society that you frequent, everything\ntells for you, everything would tell against me. You were born to\nshine in it. Women will worship that angel face of yours; won't they,\nEve?\"\n\nLucien sprang up and flung his arms about David. David's humility had\nmade short work of many doubts and plenty of difficulties. Was it\npossible not to feel twice tenderly towards this friend, who by the\nway of friendship had come to think the very thoughts that he, Lucien,\nhad reached through ambition? The aspirant for love and honors felt\nthat the way had been made smooth for him; the young man and the\ncomrade felt all his heart go out towards his friend.\n\nIt was one of those moments that come very seldom in our lives, when\nall the forces in us are sweetly strung, and every chord vibrating\ngives out full resonance.\n\nAnd yet, this goodness of a noble nature increased Lucien's human\ntendency to take himself as the centre of things. Do not all of us say\nmore or less, \"_L'Etat, c'est moi!_\" with Louis Quatorze? Lucien's\nmother and sister had concentrated all their tenderness on him, David\nwas his devoted friend; he was accustomed to see the three making\nevery effort for him in secret, and consequently he had all the faults\nof a spoiled eldest son. The noble is eaten up with the egoism which\ntheir unselfishness was fostering in Lucien; and Mme. de Bargeton was\ndoing her best to develop the same fault by inciting him to forget all\nthat he owed to his sister, and mother, and David. He was far from\ndoing so as yet; but was there not ground for the fear that as his\nsphere of ambition widened, his whole thought perforce would be how he\nmight maintain himself in it?\n\nWhen emotion had subsided, David had a suggestion to make. He thought\nthat Lucien's poem, _Saint John in Patmos_, was possibly too biblical to\nbe read before an audience but little familiar with apocalyptic\npoetry. Lucien, making his first appearance before the most exacting\npublic in the Charente, seemed to be nervous. David advised him to\ntake Andre de Chenier and substitute certain pleasure for a dubious\ndelight. Lucien was a perfect reader, the listeners would enjoy\nlistening to him, and his modesty would doubtless serve him well. Like\nmost young people, the pair were endowing the rest of the world with\ntheir own intelligence and virtues; for if youth that has not yet gone\nastray is pitiless for the sins of others, it is ready, on the other\nhand, to put a magnificent faith in them. It is only, in fact, after a\ngood deal of experience of life that we recognize the truth of\nRaphael's great saying--\"To comprehend is to equal.\"\n\nThe power of appreciating poetry is rare, generally speaking, in\nFrance; _esprit_ soon dries up the source of the sacred tears of\necstasy; nobody cares to be at the trouble of deciphering the sublime,\nof plumbing the depths to discover the infinite. Lucien was about to\nhave his first experience of the ignorance and indifference of\nworldlings. He went round by way of the printing office for David's\nvolume of poetry.\n\nThe two lovers were left alone, and David had never felt more\nembarrassed in his life. Countless terrors seized upon him; he half\nwished, half feared that Eve would praise him; he longed to run away,\nfor even modesty is not exempt from coquetry. David was afraid to\nutter a word that might seem to beg for thanks; everything that he\ncould think of put him in some false position, so he held his tongue\nand looked guilty. Eve, guessing the agony of modesty, was enjoying\nthe pause; but when David twisted his hat as if he meant to go, she\nlooked at him and smiled.\n\n\"Monsieur David,\" she said, \"if you are not going to pass the evening\nat Mme. de Bargeton's, we can spend the time together. It is fine;\nshall we take a walk along the Charente? We will have a talk about\nLucien.\"\n\nDavid longed to fling himself at the feet of this delicious girl. Eve\nhad rewarded him beyond his hopes by that tone in her voice; the\nkindness of her accent had solved the difficulties of the position,\nher suggestion was something better than praise; it was the first\ngrace given by love.\n\n\"But give me time to dress!\" she said, as David made as if to go at\nonce.\n\nDavid went out; he who all his life long had not known one tune from\nanother, was humming to himself; honest Postel hearing him with\nsurprise, conceived a vehement suspicion of Eve's feelings towards the\nprinter.\n\n\n\nThe most trifling things that happened that evening made a great\nimpression on Lucien, and his character was peculiarly susceptible to\nfirst impressions. Like all inexperienced lovers he arrived so early\nthat Louise was not in the drawing-room; but M. de Bargeton was there,\nalone. Lucien had already begun to serve his apprenticeship in the\npractice of the small deceits with which the lover of a married woman\npays for his happiness--deceits through which, moreover, she learns\nthe extent of her power; but so far Lucien had not met the lady's\nhusband face to face.\n\nM. de Bargeton's intellect was of the limited kind, exactly poised on\nthe border line between harmless vacancy, with some glimmerings of\nsense, and the excessive stupidity that can neither take in nor give\nout any idea. He was thoroughly impressed with the idea of doing his\nduty in society; and, doing his utmost to be agreeable, had adopted\nthe smile of an opera dancer as his sole method of expression.\nSatisfied, he smiled; dissatisfied, he smiled again. He smiled at good\nnews and evil tidings; with slight modifications the smile did duty on\nall occasions. If he was positively obliged to express his personal\napproval, a complacent laugh reinforced the smile; but he never\nvouchsafed a word until driven to the last extremity. A _tete-a-tete_\nput him in the one embarrassment of his vegetative existence, for then\nhe was obliged to look for something to say in the vast blank of his\nvacant interior. He usually got out of the difficulty by a return to\nthe artless ways of childhood; he thought aloud, took you into his\nconfidence concerning the smallest details of his existence, his\nphysical wants, the small sensations which did duty for ideas with\nhim. He never talked about the weather, nor did he indulge in the\nordinary commonplaces of conversation--the way of escape provided for\nweak intellects; he plunged you into the most intimate and personal\ntopics.\n\n\"I took veal this morning to please Mme. de Bargeton, who is very fond\nof veal, and my stomach has been very uneasy since,\" he would tell\nyou. \"I knew how it would be; it never suits me. How do you explain\nit?\" Or, very likely--\n\n\"I am just about to ring for a glass of _eau sucree_; will you have some\nat the same time?\"\n\nOr, \"I am going to take a ride to-morrow; I am going over to see my\nfather-in-law.\"\n\nThese short observations did not permit of discussion; a \"Yes\" or\n\"No,\" extracted from his interlocutor, the conversation dropped dead.\nThen M. de Bargeton mutely implored his visitor to come to his\nassistance. Turning westward his old asthmatic pug-dog countenance, he\ngazed at you with big, lustreless eyes, in a way that said, \"You were\nsaying?\"\n\nThe people whom he loved best were bores anxious to talk about\nthemselves; he listened to them with an unfeigned and delicate\ninterest which so endeared him to the species that all the twaddlers\nof Angouleme credited M. de Bargeton with more understanding than he\nchose to show, and were of the opinion that he was underrated. So it\nhappened that when these persons could find nobody else to listen to\nthem, they went off to give M. de Bargeton the benefit of the rest of\nthe story, argument, or what not, sure beforehand of his eulogistic\nsmile. Madame de Bargeton's rooms were always crowded, and generally\nher husband felt quite at ease. He interested himself in the smallest\ndetails; he watched those who came in and bowed and smiled, and\nbrought the new arrivals to his wife; he lay in wait for departing\nvisitors, and went with them to the door, taking leave of them with\nthat eternal smile. When conversation grew lively, and he saw that\nevery one was interested in one thing or another, he stood, happy and\nmute, planted like a swan on both feet, listening, to all appearance,\nto a political discussion; or he looked over the card-players' hands\nwithout a notion of what it was all about, for he could not play at\nany game; or he walked about and took snuff to promote digestion.\nAnais was the bright side of his life; she made it unspeakably\npleasant for him. Stretched out at full length in his armchair, he\nwatched admiringly while she did her part as hostess, for she talked\nfor him. It was a pleasure, too, to him to try to see the point in her\nremarks; and as it was often a good while before he succeeded, his\nsmiles appeared after a delay, like the explosion of a shell which has\nentered the earth and worked up again. His respect for his wife,\nmoreover, almost amounted to adoration. And so long as we can adore,\nis there not happiness enough in life? Anais' husband was as docile as\na child who asks nothing better than to be told what to do; and,\ngenerous and clever woman as she was, she had taken no undue advantage\nof his weaknesses. She had taken care of him as you take care of a\ncloak; she kept him brushed, neat, and tidy, looked closely after him,\nand humored him; and humored, looked after, brushed, kept tidy, and\ncared for, M. de Bargeton had come to feel an almost dog-like\naffection for his wife. It is so easy to give happiness that costs\nnothing! Mme. de Bargeton, knowing that her husband had no pleasure\nbut in good cheer, saw that he had good dinners; she had pity upon\nhim, she had never uttered a word of complaint; indeed, there were\npeople who could not understand that a woman might keep silence\nthrough pride, and argued that M. de Bargeton must possess good\nqualities hidden from public view. Mme. de Bargeton had drilled him\ninto military subordination; he yielded a passive obedience to his\nwife. \"Go and call on Monsieur So-and-So or Madame Such-an-One,\" she\nwould say, and he went forthwith, like a soldier at the word of\ncommand. He stood at attention in her presence, and waited motionless\nfor his orders.\n\nThere was some talk about this time of nominating the mute gentleman\nfor a deputy. Lucien as yet had not lifted the veil which hid such an\nunimaginable character; indeed, he had scarcely frequented the house\nlong enough. M. de Bargeton, spread at full length in his great chair,\nappeared to see and understand all that was going on; his silence\nadded to his dignity, and his figure inspired Lucien with a prodigious\nawe. It is the wont of imaginative natures to magnify everything, or\nto find a soul to inhabit every shape; and Lucien took this gentleman,\nnot for a granite guard-post, but for a formidable sphinx, and thought\nit necessary to conciliate him.\n\n\"I am the first comer,\" he said, bowing with more respect than people\nusually showed the worthy man.\n\n\"That is natural enough,\" said M. de Bargeton.\n\nLucien took the remark for an epigram; the lady's husband was jealous,\nhe thought; he reddened under it, looked in the glass and tried to\ngive himself a countenance.\n\n\"You live in L'Houmeau,\" said M. de Bargeton, \"and people who live a\nlong way off always come earlier than those who live near by.\"\n\n\"What is the reason of that?\" asked Lucien politely.\n\n\"I don't know,\" answered M. de Bargeton, relapsing into immobility.\n\n\"You have not cared to find out,\" Lucien began again; \"any one who\ncould make an observation could discover the cause.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said M. de Bargeton, \"final causes! Eh! eh! . . .\"\n\nThe conversation came to a dead stop; Lucien racked his brains to\nresuscitate it.\n\n\"Mme. de Bargeton is dressing, no doubt,\" he began, shuddering at the\nsilliness of the question.\n\n\"Yes, she is dressing,\" her husband naturally answered.\n\nLucien looked up at the ceiling and vainly tried to think of something\nelse to say. As his eyes wandered over the gray painted joists and the\nspaces of plaster between, he saw, not without qualms, that the little\nchandelier with the old-fashioned cut-glass pendants had been stripped\nof its gauze covering and filled with wax candles. All the covers had\nbeen removed from the furniture, and the faded flowered silk damask\nhad come to light. These preparations meant something extraordinary.\nThe poet looked at his boots, and misgivings about his costume arose\nin his mind. Grown stupid with dismay, he turned and fixed his eyes on\na Japanese jar standing on a begarlanded console table of the time of\nLouis Quinze; then, recollecting that he must conciliate Mme. de\nBargeton's husband, he tried to find out if the good gentleman had a\nhobby of any sort in which he might be humored.\n\n\"You seldom leave the city, monsieur?\" he began, returning to M. de\nBargeton.\n\n\"Very seldom.\"\n\nSilence again. M. de Bargeton watched Lucien's slightest movements\nlike a suspicious cat; the young man's presence disturbed him. Each\nwas afraid of the other.\n\n\"Can he feel suspicious of my attentions?\" thought Lucien; \"he seems\nto be anything but friendly.\"\n\nLucien was not a little embarrassed by the uneasy glances that the\nother gave him as he went to and fro, when luckily for him, the old\nman-servant (who wore livery for the occasion) announced \"M. du\nChatelet.\" The Baron came in, very much at ease, greeted his friend\nBargeton, and favored Lucien with the little nod then in vogue, which\nthe poet in his mind called purse-proud impertinence.\n\nSixte du Chatelet appeared in a pair of dazzling white trousers with\ninvisible straps that kept them in shape. He wore pumps and thread\nstockings; the black ribbon of his eyeglass meandered over a white\nwaistcoat, and the fashion and elegance of Paris was strikingly\napparent in his black coat. He was indeed just the faded beau who\nmight be expected from his antecedents, though advancing years had\nalready endowed him with a certain waist-girth which somewhat exceeded\nthe limits of elegance. He had dyed the hair and whiskers grizzled by\nhis sufferings during his travels, and this gave a hard look to his\nface. The skin which had once been so delicate had been tanned to the\ncopper-red color of Europeans from India; but in spite of his absurd\npretensions to youth, you could still discern traces of the Imperial\nHighness' charming private secretary in du Chatelet's general\nappearance. He put up his eyeglass and stared at his rival's nankeen\ntrousers, at his boots, at his waistcoat, at the blue coat made by the\nAngouleme tailor, he looked him over from head to foot, in short, then\nhe coolly returned his eyeglass to his waistcoat pocket with a gesture\nthat said, \"I am satisfied.\" And Lucien, eclipsed at this moment by\nthe elegance of the inland revenue department, thought that it would\nbe his turn by and by, when he should turn a face lighted up with\npoetry upon the assembly; but this prospect did not prevent him from\nfeeling the sharp pang that succeeded to the uncomfortable sense of M.\nde Bargeton's imagined hostility. The Baron seemed to bring all the\nweight of his fortune to bear upon him, the better to humiliate him in\nhis poverty. M. de Bargeton had counted on having no more to say, and\nhis soul was dismayed by the pause spent by the rivals in mutual\nsurvey; he had a question which he kept for desperate emergencies,\nlaid up in his mind, as it were, against a rainy day. Now was the\nproper time to bring it out.\n\n\"Well, monsieur,\" he said, looking at Chatelet with an important air,\n\"is there anything fresh? anything that people are talking about?\"\n\n\"Why, the latest thing is M. Chardon,\" Chatelet said maliciously. \"Ask\nhim. Have you brought some charming poet for us?\" inquired the\nvivacious Baron, adjusting the side curl that had gone astray on his\ntemple.\n\n\"I should have asked you whether I had succeeded,\" Lucien answered;\n\"you have been before me in the field of verse.\"\n\n\"Pshaw!\" said the other, \"a few vaudevilles, well enough in their way,\nwritten to oblige, a song now and again to suit some occasion, lines\nfor music, no good without the music, and my long Epistle to a Sister\nof Bonaparte (ungrateful that he was), will not hand down my name to\nposterity.\"\n\nAt this moment Mme. de Bargeton appeared in all the glory of an\nelaborate toilette. She wore a Jewess' turban, enriched with an\nEastern clasp. The cameos on her neck gleamed through the gauze scarf\ngracefully wound about her shoulders; the sleeves of her printed\nmuslin dress were short so as to display a series of bracelets on her\nshapely white arms. Lucien was charmed with this theatrical style of\ndress. M. du Chatelet gallantly plied the queen with fulsome\ncompliments, that made her smile with pleasure; she was so glad to be\npraised in Lucien's hearing. But she scarcely gave her dear poet a\nglance, and met Chatelet with a mortifying civility that kept him at a\ndistance.\n\nBy this time the guests began to arrive. First and foremost appeared\nthe Bishop and his Vicar-General, dignified and reverend figures both,\nthough no two men could well be more unlike, his lordship being tall\nand attenuated, and his acolyte short and fat. Both churchmen's eyes\nwere bright; but while the Bishop was pallid, his Vicar-General's\ncountenance glowed with high health. Both were impassive, and\ngesticulated but little; both appeared to be prudent men, and their\nsilence and reserve were supposed to hide great intellectual powers.\n\nClose upon the two ecclesiastics followed Mme. de Chandour and her\nhusband, a couple so extraordinary that those who are unfamiliar with\nprovincial life might be tempted to think that such persons are purely\nimaginary. Amelie de Chandour posed as the rival queen of Angouleme;\nher husband, M. de Chandour, known in the circle as Stanislas, was a\n_ci-devant_ young man, slim still at five-and-forty, with a countenance\nlike a sieve. His cravat was always tied so as to present two menacing\npoints--one spike reached the height of his right ear, the other\npointed downwards to the red ribbon of his cross. His coat-tails were\nviolently at strife. A cut-away waistcoat displayed the ample,\nswelling curves of a stiffly-starched shirt fastened by massive gold\nstuds. His dress, in fact, was exaggerated, till he looked almost like\na living caricature, which no one could behold for the first time with\ngravity.\n\nStanislas looked himself over from top to toe with a kind of\nsatisfaction; he verified the number of his waistcoat buttons, and\nfollowed the curving outlines of his tight-fitting trousers with fond\nglances that came to a standstill at last on the pointed tips of his\nshoes. When he ceased to contemplate himself in this way, he looked\ntowards the nearest mirror to see if his hair still kept in curl;\nthen, sticking a finger in his waistcoat pocket, he looked about him\nat the women with happy eyes, flinging his head back in three-quarters\nprofile with all the airs of a king of the poultry-yard, airs which\nwere prodigiously admired by the aristocratic circle of which he was\nthe beau. There was a strain of eighteenth century grossness, as a\nrule, in his talk; a detestable kind of conversation which procured\nhim some success with women--he made them laugh. M. du Chatelet was\nbeginning to give this gentleman some uneasiness; and, as a matter of\nfact, since Mme. de Bargeton had taken him up, the lively interest\ntaken by the women in the Byron of Angouleme was distinctly on the\nincrease. His coxcomb superciliousness tickled their curiosity; he\nposed as the man whom nothing can arouse from his apathy, and his\njaded Sultan airs were like a challenge.\n\nAmelie de Chandour, short, plump, fair-complexioned, and dark-haired,\nwas a poor actress; her voice was loud, like everything else about\nher; her head, with its load of feathers in winter and flowers in\nsummer, was never still for a moment. She had a fine flow of\nconversation, though she could never bring a sentence to an end\nwithout a wheezing accompaniment from an asthma, to which she would\nnot confess.\n\nM. de Saintot, otherwise Astolphe, President of the Agricultural\nSociety, a tall, stout, high-colored personage, usually appeared in\nthe wake of his wife, Elisa, a lady with a countenance like a withered\nfern, called Lili by her friends--a baby name singularly at variance\nwith its owner's character and demeanor. Mme. de Saintot was a solemn\nand extremely pious woman, and a very trying partner at a game of\ncards. Astolphe was supposed to be a scientific man of the first rank.\nHe was as ignorant as a carp, but he had compiled the articles on\nSugar and Brandy for a Dictionary of Agriculture by wholesale plunder\nof newspaper articles and pillage of previous writers. It was believed\nall over the department that M. Saintot was engaged upon a treatise on\nmodern husbandry; but though he locked himself into his study every\nmorning, he had not written a couple of pages in a dozen years. If\nanybody called to see him, he always contrived to be discovered\nrummaging among his papers, hunting for a stray note or mending a pen;\nbut he spent the whole time in his study on puerilities, reading the\nnewspaper through from end to end, cutting figures out of corks with\nhis penknife, and drawing patterns on his blotting-paper. He would\nturn over the leaves of his Cicero to see if anything applicable to\nthe events of the day might catch his eye, and drag his quotation by\nthe heels into the conversation that evening saying, \"There is a\npassage in Cicero which might have been written to suit modern times,\"\nand out came his phrase, to the astonishment of his audience.\n\"Really,\" they said among themselves, \"Astolphe is a well of\nlearning.\" The interesting fact circulated all over the town, and\nsustained the general belief in M. de Saintot's abilities.\n\nAfter this pair came M. de Bartas, known as Adrien among the circle.\nIt was M. de Bartas who boomed out his song in a bass voice, and made\nprodigious claims to musical knowledge. His self-conceit had taken a\nstand upon solfeggi; he began by admiring his appearance while he\nsang, passed thence to talking about music, and finally to talking of\nnothing else. His musical tastes had become a monomania; he grew\nanimated only on the one subject of music; he was miserable all\nevening until somebody begged him to sing. When he had bellowed one of\nhis airs, he revived again; strutted about, raised himself on his\nheels, and received compliments with a deprecating air; but modesty\ndid not prevent him from going from group to group for his meed of\npraise; and when there was no more to be said about the singer, he\nreturned to the subject of the song, discussing its difficulties or\nextolling the composer.\n\nM. Alexandre de Brebian performed heroic exploits in sepia; he\ndisfigured the walls of his friends' rooms with a swarm of crude\nproductions, and spoiled all the albums in the department. M.\nAlexandre de Brebian and M. de Bartas came together, each with his\nfriend's wife on his arm, a cross-cornered arrangement which gossip\ndeclared to be carried out to the fullest extent. As for the two\nwomen, Mesdames Charlotte de Brebian and Josephine de Bartas, or\nLolotte and Fifine, as they were called, both took an equal interest\nin a scarf, or the trimming of a dress, or the reconciliation of\nseveral irreconcilable colors; both were eaten up with a desire to\nlook like Parisiennes, and neglected their homes, where everything\nwent wrong. But if they dressed like dolls in tightly-fitting gowns of\nhome manufacture, and exhibited outrageous combinations of crude\ncolors upon their persons, their husbands availed themselves of the\nartist's privilege and dressed as they pleased, and curious it was to\nsee the provincial dowdiness of the pair. In their threadbare clothes\nthey looked like the supernumeraries that represent rank and fashion\nat stage weddings in third-rate theatres.\n\nOne of the queerest figures in the rooms was M. le Comte de Senonches,\nknown by the aristocratic name of Jacques, a mighty hunter, lean and\nsunburned, a haughty gentleman, about as amiable as a wild boar, as\nsuspicious as a Venetian, and jealous as a Moor, who lived on terms of\nthe friendliest and most perfect intimacy with M. du Hautoy, otherwise\nFrancis, the friend of the house.\n\nMadame de Senonches (Zephirine) was a tall, fine-looking woman, though\nher complexion was spoiled already by pimples due to liver complaint,\non which grounds she was said to be exacting. With a slender figure\nand delicate proportions, she could afford to indulge in languid\nmanners, savoring somewhat of affectation, but revealing passion and\nthe consciousness that every least caprice will be gratified by love.\n\nFrancis, the house friend, was rather distinguished-looking. He had\ngiven up his consulship in Valence, and sacrificed his diplomatic\nprospects to live near Zephirine (also known as Zizine) in Angouleme.\nHe had taken the household in charge, he superintended the children's\neducation, taught them foreign languages, and looked after the\nfortunes of M. and Mme. de Senonches with the most complete devotion.\nNoble Angouleme, administrative Angouleme, and _bourgeois_ Angouleme\nalike had looked askance for a long while at this phenomenon of the\nperfect union of three persons; but finally the mysterious conjugal\ntrinity appeared to them so rare and pleasing a spectacle, that if M.\ndu Hautoy had shown any intention of marrying, he would have been\nthought monstrously immoral. Mme. de Senonches, however, had a lady\ncompanion, a goddaughter, and her excessive attachment to this Mlle.\nde la Haye was beginning to raise surmises of disquieting mysteries;\nit was thought, in spite of some impossible discrepancies in dates,\nthat Francoise de la Haye bore a striking likeness to Francis du\nHautoy.\n\nWhen \"Jacques\" was shooting in the neighborhood, people used to\ninquire after Francis, and Jacques would discourse on his steward's\nlittle ailments, and talk of his wife in the second place. So curious\ndid this blindness seem in a man of jealous temper, that his greatest\nfriends used to draw him out on the topic for the amusement of others\nwho did not know of the mystery. M. du Hautoy was a finical dandy\nwhose minute care of himself had degenerated into mincing affectation\nand childishness. He took an interest in his cough, his appetite, his\ndigestion, his night's rest. Zephirine had succeeded in making a\nvaletudinarian of her factotum; she coddled him and doctored him; she\ncrammed him with delicate fare, as if he had been a fine lady's\nlap-dog; she embroidered waistcoats for him, and pocket-handkerchiefs\nand cravats until he became so used to wearing finery that she\ntransformed him into a kind of Japanese idol. Their understanding was\nperfect. In season and out of season Zizine consulted Francis with a\nlook, and Francis seemed to take his ideas from Zizine's eyes. They\nfrowned and smiled together, and seemingly took counsel of each other\nbefore making the simplest commonplace remark.\n\nThe largest landowner in the neighborhood, a man whom every one\nenvied, was the Marquis de Pimentel; he and his wife, between them,\nhad an income of forty thousand livres, and spent their winters in\nParis. This evening they had driven into Angouleme in their caleche,\nand had brought their neighbors, the Baron and Baroness de Rastignac\nand their party, the Baroness' aunt and daughters, two charming young\nladies, penniless girls who had been carefully brought up, and were\ndressed in the simple way that sets off natural loveliness.\n\nThese personages, beyond question the first in the company, met with a\nreception of chilling silence; the respect paid to them was full of\njealousy, especially as everybody saw that Mme. de Bargeton paid\nmarked attention to the guests. The two families belonged to the very\nsmall minority who hold themselves aloof from provincial gossip,\nbelong to no clique, live quietly in retirement, and maintain a\ndignified reserve. M. de Pimentel and M. de Rastignac, for instance,\nwere addressed by their names in full, and no length of acquaintance\nhad brought their wives and daughters into the select coterie of\nAngouleme; both families were too nearly connected with the Court to\ncompromise themselves through provincial follies.\n\nThe Prefect and the General in command of the garrison were the last\ncomers, and with them came the country gentleman who had brought the\ntreatise on silkworms to David that very morning. Evidently he was the\nmayor of some canton or other, and a fine estate was his sufficient\ntitle to gentility; but from his appearance, it was plain that he was\nquite unused to polite society. He looked uneasy in his clothes, he\nwas at a loss to know what to do with his hands, he shifted about from\none foot to another as he spoke, and half rose and sat down again when\nanybody spoke to him. He seemed ready to do some menial service; he\nwas obsequious, nervous, and grave by turns, laughing eagerly at every\njoke, listening with servility; and occasionally, imagining that\npeople were laughing at him, he assumed a knowing air. His treatise\nweighed upon his mind; again and again he tried to talk about\nsilkworms; but the luckless wight happened first upon M. de Bartas,\nwho talked music in reply, and next on M. de Saintot, who quoted\nCicero to him; and not until the evening was half over did the mayor\nmeet with sympathetic listeners in Mme. and Mlle. du Brossard, a\nwidowed gentlewoman and her daughter.\n\nMme. and Mlle. du Brossard were not the least interesting persons in\nthe clique, but their story may be told in a single phrase--they were\nas poor as they were noble. In their dress there was just that tinge\nof pretension which betrayed carefully hidden penury. The daughter, a\nbig, heavy young woman of seven-and-twenty, was supposed to be a good\nperformer on the piano, and her mother praised her in season and out\nof season in the clumsiest way. No eligible man had any taste which\nCamille did not share on her mother's authoritative statement. Mme. du\nBrossard, in her anxiety to establish her child, was capable of saying\nthat her dear Camille liked nothing so much as a roving life from one\ngarrison to another; and before the evening was out, that she was sure\nher dear Camille liked a quiet country farmhouse existence of all\nthings. Mother and daughter had the pinched sub-acid dignity\ncharacteristic of those who have learned by experience the exact value\nof expressions of sympathy; they belonged to a class which the world\ndelights to pity; they had been the objects of the benevolent interest\nof egoism; they had sounded the empty void beneath the consoling\nformulas with which the world ministers to the necessities of the\nunfortunate.\n\nM. de Severac was fifty-nine years old, and a childless widower.\nMother and daughter listened, therefore, with devout admiration to all\nthat he told them about his silkworm nurseries.\n\n\"My daughter has always been fond of animals,\" said the mother. \"And\nas women are especially interested in the silk which the little\ncreatures produce, I shall ask permission to go over to Severac, so\nthat my Camille may see how the silk is spun. My Camille is so\nintelligent, she will grasp anything that you tell her in a moment.\nDid she not understand one day the inverse ratio of the squares of\ndistances!\"\n\nThis was the remark that brought the conversation between Mme. du\nBrossard and M. de Severac to a glorious close after Lucien's reading\nthat night.\n\nA few habitues slipped in familiarly among the rest, so did one or two\neldest sons; shy, mute young men tricked out in gorgeous jewelry, and\nhighly honored by an invitation to this literary solemnity, the\nboldest men among them so far shook off the weight of awe as to\nchatter a good deal with Mlle. de la Haye. The women solemnly arranged\nthemselves in a circle, and the men stood behind them. It was a quaint\nassemblage of wrinkled countenances and heterogeneous costumes, but\nnone the less it seemed very alarming to Lucien, and his heart beat\nfast when he felt that every one was looking at him. His assurance\nbore the ordeal with some difficulty in spite of the encouraging\nexample of Mme. de Bargeton, who welcomed the most illustrious\npersonages of Angouleme with ostentatious courtesy and elaborate\ngraciousness; and the uncomfortable feeling that oppressed him was\naggravated by a trifling matter which any one might have foreseen,\nthough it was bound to come as an unpleasant shock to a young man with\nso little experience of the world. Lucien, all eyes and ears, noticed\nthat no one except Louise, M. de Bargeton, the Bishop, and some few\nwho wished to please the mistress of the house, spoke of him as M. de\nRubempre; for his formidable audience he was M. Chardon. Lucien's\ncourage sank under their inquisitive eyes. He could read his plebeian\nname in the mere movements of their lips, and hear the anticipatory\ncriticisms made in the blunt, provincial fashion that too often\nborders on rudeness. He had not expected this prolonged ordeal of\npin-pricks; it put him still more out of humor with himself. He grew\nimpatient to begin the reading, for then he could assume an attitude\nwhich should put an end to his mental torments; but Jacques was giving\nMme. de Pimentel the history of his last day's sport; Adrien was\nholding forth to Mlle. Laure de Rastignac on Rossini, the newly-risen\nmusic star, and Astolphe, who had got by heart a newspaper paragraph\non a patent plow, was giving the Baron the benefit of the description.\nLucien, luckless poet that he was, did not know that there was scarce\na soul in the room besides Mme. de Bargeton who could understand\npoetry. The whole matter-of-fact assembly was there by a\nmisapprehension, nor did they, for the most part, know what they had\ncome out for to see. There are some words that draw a public as\nunfailingly as the clash of cymbals, the trumpet, or the mountebank's\nbig drum; \"beauty,\" \"glory,\" \"poetry,\" are words that bewitch the\ncoarsest intellect.\n\nWhen every one had arrived; when the buzz of talk ceased after\nrepeated efforts on the part of M. de Bargeton, who, obedient to his\nwife, went round the room much as the beadle makes the circle of the\nchurch, tapping the pavement with his wand; when silence, in fact, was\nat last secured, Lucien went to the round table near Mme. de Bargeton.\nA fierce thrill of excitement ran through him as he did so. He\nannounced in an uncertain voice that, to prevent disappointment, he\nwas about to read the masterpieces of a great poet, discovered only\nrecently (for although Andre de Chenier's poems appeared in 1819, no\none in Angouleme had so much as heard of him). Everybody interpreted\nthis announcement in one way--it was a shift of Mme. de Bargeton's,\nmeant to save the poet's self-love and to put the audience at ease.\n\nLucien began with _Le Malade_, and the poem was received with a murmur\nof applause; but he followed it with _L'Aveugle_, which proved too great\na strain upon the average intellect. None but artists or those endowed\nwith the artistic temperament can understand and sympathize with him\nin the diabolical torture of that reading. If poetry is to be rendered\nby the voice, and if the listener is to grasp all that it means, the\nmost devout attention is essential; there should be an intimate\nalliance between the reader and his audience, or swift and subtle\ncommunication of the poet's thought and feeling becomes impossible.\nHere this close sympathy was lacking, and Lucien in consequence was in\nthe position of an angel who should endeavor to sing of heaven amid\nthe chucklings of hell. An intelligent man in the sphere most\nstimulating to his faculties can see in every direction, like a snail;\nhe has the keen scent of a dog, the ears of a mole; he can hear, and\nfeel, and see all that is going on around him. A musician or a poet\nknows at once whether his audience is listening in admiration or fails\nto follow him, and feels it as the plant that revives or droops under\nfavorable or unfavorable conditions. The men who had come with their\nwives had fallen to discussing their own affairs; by the acoustic law\nbefore mentioned, every murmur rang in Lucien's ear; he saw all the\ngaps caused by the spasmodic workings of jaws sympathetically\naffected, the teeth that seemed to grin defiance at him.\n\nWhen, like the dove in the deluge, he looked round for any spot on\nwhich his eyes might rest, he saw nothing but rows of impatient faces.\nTheir owners clearly were waiting for him to make an end; they had\ncome together to discuss questions of practical interest. With the\nexceptions of Laure de Rastignac, the Bishop, and two or three of the\nyoung men, they one and all looked bored. As a matter of fact, those\nwho understand poetry strive to develop the germs of another poetry,\nquickened within them by the poet's poetry; but this glacial audience,\nso far from attaining to the spirit of the poet, did not even listen\nto the letter.\n\nLucien felt profoundly discouraged; he was damp with chilly\nperspiration; a glowing glance from Louise, to whom he turned, gave\nhim courage to persevere to the end, but this poet's heart was\nbleeding from countless wounds.\n\n\"Do you find this very amusing, Fifine?\" inquired the wizened Lili,\nwho perhaps had expected some kind of gymnastics.\n\n\"Don't ask me what I think, dear; I cannot keep my eyes open when any\none begins to read aloud.\"\n\n\"I hope that Nais will not give us poetry often in the evenings,\" said\nFrancis. \"If I am obliged to attend while somebody reads aloud after\ndinner, it upsets my digestion.\"\n\n\"Poor dearie,\" whispered Zephirine, \"take a glass of eau _sucree_.\"\n\n\"It was very well declaimed,\" said Alexandre, \"but I like whist better\nmyself.\"\n\nAfter this dictum, which passed muster as a joke from the play on the\nword \"whist,\" several card-players were of the opinion that the\nreader's voice needed a rest, and on this pretext one or two couples\nslipped away into the card-room. But Louise, and the Bishop, and\npretty Laure de Rastignac besought Lucien to continue, and this time\nhe caught the attention of his audience with Chenier's spirited\nreactionary _Iambes_. Several persons, carried away by his impassioned\ndelivery, applauded the reading without understanding the sense.\nPeople of this sort are impressed by vociferation, as a coarse palate\nis ticked by strong spirits.\n\nDuring the interval, as they partook of ices, Zephirine despatched\nFrancis to examine the volume, and informed her neighbor Amelie that\nthe poetry was in print.\n\nAmelie brightened visibly.\n\n\"Why, that is easily explained,\" said she. \"M. de Rubempre works for a\nprinter. It is as if a pretty woman should make her own dresses,\" she\nadded, looking at Lolotte.\n\n\"He printed his poetry himself!\" said the women among themselves.\n\n\"Then, why does he call himself M. de Rubempre?\" inquired Jacques. \"If\na noble takes a handicraft, he ought to lay his name aside.\"\n\n\"So he did as a matter of fact,\" said Zizine, \"but his name was\nplebeian, and he took his mother's name, which is noble.\"\n\n\"Well, if his verses are printed, we can read them for ourselves,\"\nsaid Astolphe.\n\nThis piece of stupidity complicated the question, until Sixte du\nChatelet condescended to inform these unlettered folk that the\nprefatory announcement was no oratorical flourish, but a statement of\nfact, and added that the poems had been written by a Royalist brother\nof Marie-Joseph Chenier, the Revolutionary leader. All Angouleme,\nexcept Mme. de Rastignac and her two daughters and the Bishop, who had\nreally felt the grandeur of the poetry, were mystified, and took\noffence at the hoax. There was a smothered murmur, but Lucien did not\nheed it. The intoxication of the poetry was upon him; he was far away\nfrom the hateful world, striving to render in speech the music that\nfilled his soul, seeing the faces about him through a cloudy haze. He\nread the sombre Elegy on the Suicide, lines in the taste of a by-gone\nday, pervaded by sublime melancholy; then he turned to the page where\nthe line occurs, \"Thy songs are sweet, I love to say them over,\" and\nended with the delicate idyll _Neere_.\n\nMme. de Bargeton sat with one hand buried in her curls, heedless of\nthe havoc she wrought among them, gazing before her with unseeing\neyes, alone in her drawing-room, lost in delicious dreaming; for the\nfirst time in her life she had been transported to the sphere which\nwas hers by right of nature. Judge, therefore, how unpleasantly she\nwas disturbed by Amelie, who took it upon herself to express the\ngeneral wish.\n\n\"Nais,\" this voice broke in, \"we came to hear M. Chardon's poetry, and\nyou are giving us poetry out of a book. The extracts are very nice,\nbut the ladies feel a patriotic preference for the wine of the\ncountry; they would rather have it.\"\n\n\"The French language does not lend itself very readily to poetry, does\nit?\" Astolphe remarked to Chatelet. \"Cicero's prose is a thousand\ntimes more poetical to my way of thinking.\"\n\n\"The true poetry of France is song, lyric verse,\" Chatelet answered.\n\n\"Which proves that our language is eminently adapted for music,\" said\nAdrien.\n\n\"I should like very much to hear the poetry that has cost Nais her\nreputation,\" said Zephirine; \"but after receiving Amelie's request in\nsuch a way, it is not very likely that she will give us a specimen.\"\n\n\"She ought to have them recited in justice to herself,\" said Francis.\n\"The little fellow's genius is his sole justification.\"\n\n\"You have been in the diplomatic service,\" said Amelie to M. du\nChatelet, \"go and manage it somehow.\"\n\n\"Nothing easier,\" said the Baron.\n\nThe Princess' private secretary, being accustomed to petty manoeuvres\nof this kind, went to the Bishop and contrived to bring him to the\nfore. At the Bishop's entreaty, Nais had no choice but to ask Lucien\nto recite his own verses for them, and the Baron received a\nlanguishing smile from Amelie as the reward of his prompt success.\n\n\"Decidedly, the Baron is a very clever man,\" she observed to Lolotte.\n\nBut Amelie's previous acidulous remark about women who made their own\ndresses rankled in Lolotte's mind.\n\n\"Since when have you begun to recognize the Emperor's barons?\" she\nasked, smiling.\n\nLucien had essayed to deify his beloved in an ode, dedicated to her\nunder a title in favor with all lads who write verse after leaving\nschool. This ode, so fondly cherished, so beautiful--since it was the\noutpouring of all the love in his heart, seemed to him to be the one\npiece of his own work that could hold its own with Chenier's verse;\nand with a tolerably fatuous glance at Mme. de Bargeton, he announced\n\"TO HER!\" He struck an attitude proudly for the delivery of the\nambitious piece, for his author's self-love felt safe and at ease\nbehind Mme. de Bargeton's petticoat. And at the selfsame moment Mme.\nde Bargeton betrayed her own secret to the women's curious eyes.\nAlthough she had always looked down upon this audience from her own\nloftier intellectual heights, she could not help trembling for Lucien.\nHer face was troubled, there was a sort of mute appeal for indulgence\nin her glances, and while the verses were recited she was obliged to\nlower her eyes and dissemble her pleasure as stanza followed stanza.\n\n\n                               TO HER.\n\nOut of the glowing heart of the torrent of glory and light,\n  At the foot of Jehovah's throne where the angels stand afar,\nEach on a seistron of gold repeating the prayers of the night,\n          Put up for each by his star.\n\nOut from the cherubim choir a bright-haired Angel springs,\n  Veiling the glory of God that dwells on a dazzling brow,\nLeaving the courts of heaven to sink upon silver wings\n          Down to our world below.\n\nGod looked in pity on earth, and the Angel, reading His thought,\n  Came down to lull the pain of the mighty spirit at strife,\nReverent bent o'er the maid, and for age left desolate brought\n          Flowers of the springtime of life.\n\nBringing a dream of hope to solace the mother's fears,\n  Hearkening unto the voice of the tardy repentant cry,\nGlad as angels are glad, to reckon Earth's pitying tears,\n          Given with alms of a sigh.\n\nOne there is, and but one, bright messenger sent from the skies\n  Whom earth like a lover fain would hold from the hea'nward flight;\nBut the angel, weeping, turns and gazes with sad, sweet eyes\n          Up to the heaven of light.\n\nNot by the radiant eyes, not by the kindling glow\n  Of virtue sent from God, did I know the secret sign,\nNor read the token sent on a white and dazzling brow\n          Of an origin divine.\n\nNay, it was Love grown blind and dazed with excess of light,\n  Striving and striving in vain to mingle Earth and Heaven,\nHelpless and powerless against the invincible armor bright\n          By the dread archangel given.\n\nAh! be wary, take heed, lest aught should be seen or heard\n  Of the shining seraph band, as they take the heavenward way;\nToo soon the Angel on Earth will learn the magical word\n          Sung at the close of the day.\n\nThen you shall see afar, rifting the darkness of night,\n  A gleam as of dawn that spread across the starry floor,\nAnd the seaman that watch for a sign shall mark the track of their flight,\n          A luminous pathway in Heaven and a beacon for evermore.\n\n\"Do you read the riddle?\" said Amelie, giving M. du Chatelet a\ncoquettish glance.\n\n\"It is the sort of stuff that we all of us wrote more or less after we\nleft school,\" said the Baron with a bored expression--he was acting\nhis part of arbiter of taste who has seen everything. \"We used to deal\nin Ossianic mists, Malvinas and Fingals and cloudy shapes, and\nwarriors who got out of their tombs with stars above their heads.\nNowadays this poetical frippery has been replaced by Jehovah, angels,\nseistrons, the plumes of seraphim, and all the paraphernalia of\nparadise freshened up with a few new words such as 'immense, infinite,\nsolitude, intelligence'; you have lakes, and the words of the\nAlmighty, a kind of Christianized Pantheism, enriched with the most\nextraordinary and unheard-of rhymes. We are in quite another latitude,\nin fact; we have left the North for the East, but the darkness is just\nas thick as before.\"\n\n\"If the ode is obscure, the declaration is very clear, it seems to\nme,\" said Zephirine.\n\n\"And the archangel's armor is a tolerably thin gauze robe,\" said\nFrancis.\n\nPoliteness demanded that the audience should profess to be enchanted\nwith the poem; and the women, furious because they had no poets in\ntheir train to extol them as angels, rose, looked bored by the\nreading, murmuring, \"Very nice!\" \"Charming!\" \"Perfect!\" with frigid\ncoldness.\n\n\"If you love me, do not congratulate the poet or his angel,\" Lolotte\nlaid her commands on her dear Adrien in imperious tones, and Adrien\nwas fain to obey.\n\n\"Empty words, after all,\" Zephirine remarked to Francis, \"and love is\na poem that we live.\"\n\n\"You have just expressed the very thing that I was thinking, Zizine,\nbut I should not have put it so neatly,\" said Stanislas, scanning\nhimself from top to toe with loving attention.\n\n\"I would give, I don't know how much, to see Nais' pride brought down\na bit,\" said Amelie, addressing Chatelet. \"Nais sets up to be an\narchangel, as if she were better than the rest of us, and mixes us up\nwith low people; his father was an apothecary, and his mother is a\nnurse; his sister works in a laundry, and he himself is a printer's\nforeman.\"\n\n\"If his father sold biscuits for worms\" (_vers_), said Jacques, \"he\nought to have made his son take them.\"\n\n\"He is continuing in his father's line of business, for the stuff that\nhe has just been reading to us is a drug in the market, it seems,\"\nsaid Stanislas, striking one of his most killing attitudes. \"Drug for\ndrug, I would rather have something else.\"\n\nEvery one apparently combined to humiliate Lucien by various\naristocrats' sarcasms. Lili the religious thought it a charitable deed\nto use any means of enlightening Nais, and Nais was on the brink of a\npiece of folly. Francis the diplomatist undertook the direction of the\nsilly conspiracy; every one was interested in the progress of the\ndrama; it would be something to talk about to-morrow. The ex-consul,\nbeing far from anxious to engage in a duel with a young poet who would\nfly into a rage at the first hint of insult under his lady's eyes, was\nwise enough to see that the only way of dealing Lucien his deathblow\nwas by the spiritual arm which was safe from vengeance. He therefore\nfollowed the example set by Chatelet the astute, and went to the\nBishop. Him he proceeded to mystify.\n\nHe told the Bishop that Lucien's mother was a woman of uncommon powers\nand great modesty, and that it was she who found the subjects for her\nson's verses. Nothing pleased Lucien so much, according to the\nguileful Francis, as any recognition of her talents--he worshiped his\nmother. Then, having inculcated these notions, he left the rest to\ntime. His lordship was sure to bring out the insulting allusion, for\nwhich he had been so carefully prepared, in the course of\nconversation.\n\nWhen Francis and the Bishop joined the little group where Lucien\nstood, the circle who gave him the cup of hemlock to drain by little\nsips watched him with redoubled interest. The poet, luckless young\nman, being a total stranger, and unaware of the manners and customs of\nthe house, could only look at Mme. de Bargeton and give embarrassed\nanswers to embarrassing questions. He knew neither the names nor\ncondition of the people about him; the women's silly speeches made him\nblush for them, and he was at his wits' end for a reply. He felt,\nmoreover, how very far removed he was from these divinities of\nAngouleme when he heard himself addressed sometimes as M. Chardon,\nsometimes as M. de Rubempre, while they addressed each other as\nLolotte, Adrien, Astolphe, Lili and Fifine. His confusion rose to a\nheight when, taking Lili for a man's surname, he addressed the coarse\nM. de Senonches as M. Lili; that Nimrod broke in upon him with a\n\"_MONSIEUR LULU?_\" and Mme. de Bargeton flushed red to the eyes.\n\n\"A woman must be blind indeed to bring this little fellow among us!\"\nmuttered Senonches.\n\nZephirine turned to speak to the Marquise de Pimentel--\"Do you not see\na strong likeness between M. Chardon and M. de Cante-Croix, madame?\"\nshe asked in a low but quite audible voice.\n\n\"The likeness is ideal,\" smiled Mme. de Pimentel.\n\n\"Glory has a power of attraction to which we can confess,\" said Mme.\nde Bargeton, addressing the Marquise. \"Some women are as much\nattracted by greatness as others by littleness,\" she added, looking at\nFrancis.\n\nThe was beyond Zephirine's comprehension; she thought her consul a\nvery great man; but the Marquise laughed, and her laughter ranged her\non Nais' side.\n\n\"You are very fortunate, monsieur,\" said the Marquis de Pimentel,\naddressing Lucien for the purpose of calling him M. de Rubempre, and\nnot M. Chardon, as before; \"you should never find time heavy on your\nhands.\"\n\n\"Do you work quickly?\" asked Lolotte, much in the way that she would\nhave asked a joiner \"if it took long to make a box.\"\n\nThe bludgeon stroke stunned Lucien, but he raised his head at Mme. de\nBargeton's reply--\n\n\"My dear, poetry does not grow in M. de Rubempre's head like grass in\nour courtyards.\"\n\n\"Madame, we cannot feel too reverently towards the noble spirits in\nwhom God has set some ray of this light,\" said the Bishop, addressing\nLolotte. \"Yes, poetry is something holy. Poetry implies suffering. How\nmany silent nights those verses that you admire have cost! We should\nbow in love and reverence before the poet; his life here is almost\nalways a life of sorrow; but God doubtless reserves a place in heaven\nfor him among His prophets. This young man is a poet,\" he added laying\na hand on Lucien's head; \"do you not see the sign of Fate set on that\nhigh forehead of his?\"\n\nGlad to be so generously championed, Lucien made his acknowledgments\nin a grateful look, not knowing that the worthy prelate was to deal\nhis deathblow.\n\nMme. de Bargeton's eyes traveled round the hostile circle. Her glances\nwent like arrows to the depths of her rivals' hearts, and left them\ntwice as furious as before.\n\n\"Ah, monseigneur,\" cried Lucien, hoping to break thick heads with his\ngolden sceptre, \"but ordinary people have neither your intellect nor\nyour charity. No one heeds our sorrows, our toil is unrecognized. The\ngold-digger working in the mine does not labor as we to wrest\nmetaphors from the heart of the most ungrateful of all languages. If\nthis is poetry--to give ideas such definite and clear expressions that\nall the world can see and understand--the poet must continually range\nthrough the entire scale of human intellects, so that he can satisfy\nthe demands of all; he must conceal hard thinking and emotion, two\nantagonistic powers, beneath the most vivid color; he must know how to\nmake one word cover a whole world of thought; he must give the results\nof whole systems of philosophy in a few picturesque lines; indeed, his\nsongs are like seeds that must break into blossom in other hearts\nwherever they find the soil prepared by personal experience. How can\nyou express unless you first have felt? And is not passion suffering.\nPoetry is only brought forth after painful wanderings in the vast\nregions of thought and life. There are men and women in books, who\nseem more really alive to us than men and women who have lived and\ndied--Richardson's Clarissa, Chenier's Camille, the Delia of Tibullus,\nAriosto's Angelica, Dante's Francesca, Moliere's Alceste,\nBeaumarchais' Figaro, Scott's Rebecca the Jewess, the Don Quixote of\nCervantes,--do we not owe these deathless creations to immortal\nthroes?\"\n\n\"And what are you going to create for us?\" asked Chatelet.\n\n\"If I were to announce such conceptions, I should give myself out for\na man of genius, should I not?\" answered Lucien. \"And besides, such\nsublime creations demand a long experience of the world and a study of\nhuman passion and interests which I could not possibly have made; but\nI have made a beginning,\" he added, with bitterness in his tone, as he\ntook a vengeful glance round the circle; \"the time of gestation is\nlong----\"\n\n\"Then it will be a case of difficult labor,\" interrupted M. du Hautoy.\n\n\"Your excellent mother might assist you,\" suggested the Bishop.\n\nThe epigram, innocently made by the good prelate, the long-looked-for\nrevenge, kindled a gleam of delight in all eyes. The smile of\nsatisfied caste that traveled from mouth to mouth was aggravated by M.\nde Bargeton's imbecility; he burst into a laugh, as usual, some\nmoments later.\n\n\"Monseigneur, you are talking a little above our heads; these ladies\ndo not understand your meaning,\" said Mme. de Bargeton, and the words\nparalyzed the laughter, and drew astonished eyes upon her. \"A poet who\nlooks to the Bible for his inspiration has a mother indeed in the\nChurch.--M. de Rubempre, will you recite _Saint John in Patmos_ for us,\nor _Belshazzar's Feast_, so that his lordship may see that Rome is still\nthe _Magna Parens_ of Virgil?\"\n\nThe women exchanged smiles at the Latin words.\n\nThe bravest and highest spirits know times of prostration at the\noutset of life. Lucien had sunk to the depths at the blow, but he\nstruck the bottom with his feet, and rose to the surface again, vowing\nto subjugate this little world. He rose like a bull, stung to fury by\na shower of darts, and prepared to obey Louise by declaiming _Saint\nJohn in Patmos_; but by this time the card-tables had claimed their\ncomplement of players, who returned to the accustomed groove to find\namusement there which poetry had not afforded them. They felt besides\nthat the revenge of so many outraged vanities would be incomplete\nunless it were followed up by contemptuous indifference; so they\nshowed their tacit disdain for the native product by leaving Lucien\nand Mme. de Bargeton to themselves. Every one appeared to be absorbed\nin his own affairs; one chattered with the prefect about a new\ncrossroad, another proposed to vary the pleasures of the evening with\na little music. The great world of Angouleme, feeling that it was no\njudge of poetry, was very anxious, in the first place, to hear the\nverdict of the Pimentels and the Rastignacs, and formed a little group\nabout them. The great influence wielded in the department by these two\nfamilies was always felt on every important occasion; every one was\njealous of them, every one paid court to them, foreseeing that they\nmight some day need that influence.\n\n\"What do you think of our poet and his poetry?\" Jacques asked of the\nMarquise. Jacques used to shoot over the lands belonging to the\nPimentel family.\n\n\"Why, it is not bad for provincial poetry,\" she said, smiling; \"and\nbesides, such a beautiful poet cannot do anything amiss.\"\n\nEvery one thought the decision admirable; it traveled from lip to lip,\ngaining malignance by the way. Then Chatelet was called upon to\naccompany M. du Bartas on the piano while he mangled the great solo\nfrom _Figaro_; and the way being opened to music, the audience, as in\nduty bound listened while Chatelet in turn sang one of Chateaubriand's\nballads, a chivalrous ditty made in the time of the Empire. Duets\nfollowed, of the kind usually left to boarding-school misses, and\nrescued from the schoolroom by Mme. du Brossard, who meant to make a\nbrilliant display of her dear Camille's talents for M. de Severac's\nbenefit.\n\nMme. du Bargeton, hurt by the contempt which every one showed her\npoet, paid back scorn for scorn by going to her boudoir during these\nperformances. She was followed by the prelate. His Vicar-General had\njust been explaining the profound irony of the epigram into which he\nhad been entrapped, and the Bishop wished to make amends. Mlle. de\nRastignac, fascinated by the poetry, also slipped into the boudoir\nwithout her mother's knowledge.\n\nLouise drew Lucien to her mattress-cushioned sofa; and with no one to\nsee or hear, she murmured in his ear, \"Dear angel, they did not\nunderstand you; but, 'Thy songs are sweet, I love to say them over.'\"\n\nAnd Lucien took comfort from the pretty speech, and forgot his woes\nfor a little.\n\n\"Glory is not to be had cheaply,\" Mme. de Bargeton continued, taking\nhis hand and holding it tightly in her own. \"Endure your woes, my\nfriend, you will be great one day; your pain is the price of your\nimmortality. If only I had a hard struggle before me! God preserve you\nfrom the enervating life without battles, in which the eagle's wings\nhave no room to spread themselves. I envy you; for if you suffer, at\nleast you live. You will put out your strength, you will feel the hope\nof victory; your strife will be glorious. And when you shall come to\nyour kingdom, and reach the imperial sphere where great minds are\nenthroned, then remember the poor creatures disinherited by fate,\nwhose intellects pine in an oppressive moral atmosphere, who die and\nhave never lived, knowing all the while what life might be; think of\nthe piercing eyes that have seen nothing, the delicate senses that\nhave only known the scent of poison flowers. Then tell in your song of\nplants that wither in the depths of the forest, choked by twining\ngrowths and rank, greedy vegetation, plants that have never been\nkissed by the sunlight, and die, never having put forth a blossom. It\nwould be a terribly gloomy poem, would it not, a fanciful subject?\nWhat a sublime poem might be made of the story of some daughter of the\ndesert transported to some cold, western clime, calling for her\nbeloved sun, dying of a grief that none can understand, overcome with\ncold and longing. It would be an allegory; many lives are like that.\"\n\n\"You would picture the spirit which remembers Heaven,\" said the\nBishop; \"some one surely must have written such a poem in the days of\nold; I like to think that I see a fragment of it in the Song of\nSongs.\"\n\n\"Take that as your subject,\" said Laure de Rastignac, expressing her\nartless belief in Lucien's powers.\n\n\"The great sacred poem of France is still unwritten,\" remarked the\nBishop. \"Believe me, glory and success await the man of talent who\nshall work for religion.\"\n\n\"That task will be his,\" said Mme. de Bargeton rhetorically. \"Do you\nnot see the first beginnings of the vision of the poem, like the flame\nof dawn, in his eyes?\"\n\n\"Nais is treating us very badly,\" said Fifine; \"what can she be\ndoing?\"\n\n\"Don't you hear?\" said Stanislas. \"She is flourishing away, using big\nwords that you cannot make head or tail of.\"\n\nAmelie, Fifine, Adrien, and Francis appeared in the doorway with Mme.\nde Rastignac, who came to look for her daughter.\n\n\"Nais,\" cried the two ladies, both delighted to break in upon the\nquiet chat in the boudoir, \"it would be very nice of you to come and\nplay something for us.\"\n\n\"My dear child, M. de Rubempre is just about to recite his _Saint John\nin Patmos_, a magnificent biblical poem.\"\n\n\"Biblical!\" echoed Fifine in amazement.\n\nAmelie and Fifine went back to the drawing-room, taking the word back\nwith them as food for laughter. Lucien pleaded a defective memory and\nexcused himself. When he reappeared, nobody took the slightest notice\nof him; every one was chatting or busy at the card-tables; the poet's\naureole had been plucked away, the landowners had no use for him, the\nmore pretentious sort looked upon him as an enemy to their ignorance,\nwhile the women were jealous of Mme. de Bargeton, the Beatrice of this\nmodern Dante, to use the Vicar-General's phrase, and looked at him\nwith cold, scornful eyes.\n\n\"So this is society!\" Lucien said to himself as he went down to\nL'Houmeau by the steps of Beaulieu; for there are times when we choose\nto take the longest way, that the physical exercise of walking may\npromote the flow of ideas.\n\nSo far from being disheartened, the fury of repulsed ambition gave\nLucien new strength. Like all those whose instincts bring them to a\nhigher social sphere which they reach before they can hold their own\nin it, Lucien vowed to make any sacrifice to the end that he might\nremain on that higher social level. One by one he drew out the\npoisoned shafts on his way home, talking aloud to himself, scoffing at\nthe fools with whom he had to do, inventing neat answers to their\nidiotic questions, desperately vexed that the witty responses occurred\nto him so late in the day. By the time that he reached the Bordeaux\nroad, between the river and the foot of the hill, he thought that he\ncould see Eve and David sitting on a baulk of timber by the river in\nthe moonlight, and went down the footpath towards them.\n\n\n\nWhile Lucien was hastening to the torture in Mme. de Bargeton's rooms,\nhis sister had changed her dress for a gown of pink cambric covered\nwith narrow stripes, a straw hat, and a little silk shawl. The simple\ncostume seemed like a rich toilette on Eve, for she was one of those\nwomen whose great nature lends stateliness to the least personal\ndetail; and David felt prodigiously shy of her now that she had\nchanged her working dress. He had made up his mind that he would speak\nof himself; but now as he gave his arm to this beautiful girl, and\nthey walked through L'Houmeau together, he could find nothing to say\nto her. Love delights in such reverent awe as redeemed souls know on\nbeholding the glory of God. So, in silence, the two lovers went across\nthe Bridge of Saint Anne, and followed the left bank of the Charente.\nEve felt embarrassed by the pause, and stopped to look along the\nriver; a joyous shaft of sunset had turned the water between the\nbridge and the new powder mills into a sheet of gold.\n\n\"What a beautiful evening it is!\" she said, for the sake of saying\nsomething; \"the air is warm and fresh, and full of the scent of\nflowers, and there is a wonderful sky.\"\n\n\"Everything speaks to our heart,\" said David, trying to proceed to\nlove by way of analogy. \"Those who love find infinite delight in\ndiscovering the poetry of their own inmost souls in every chance\neffect of the landscape, in the thin, clear air, in the scent of the\nearth. Nature speaks for them.\"\n\n\"And loosens their tongues, too,\" Eve said merrily. \"You were very\nsilent as we came through L'Houmeau. Do you know, I felt quite\nuncomfortable----\"\n\n\"You looked so beautiful, that I could not say anything,\" David\nanswered candidly.\n\n\"Then, just now I am not so beautiful?\" inquired she.\n\n\"It is not that,\" he said; \"but I was so happy to have this walk alone\nwith you, that----\" he stopped short in confusion, and looked at the\nhillside and the road to Saintes.\n\n\"If the walk is any pleasure to you, I am delighted; for I owe you an\nevening, I think, when you have given up yours for me. When you\nrefused to go to Mme. de Bargeton's, you were quite as generous as\nLucien when he made the demand at the risk of vexing her.\"\n\n\"No, not generous, only wise,\" said David. \"And now that we are quite\nalone under the sky, with no listeners except the bushes and the reeds\nby the edge of the Charente, let me tell you about my anxiety as to\nLucien's present step, dear Eve. After all that I have just said, I\nhope that you will look on my fears as a refinement of friendship. You\nand your mother have done all that you could to put him above his\nsocial position; but when you stimulated his ambition, did you not\nunthinkingly condemn him to a hard struggle? How can he maintain\nhimself in the society to which his tastes incline him? I know Lucien;\nhe likes to reap, he does not like toil; it is his nature. Social\nclaims will take up the whole of his time, and for a man who has\nnothing but his brains, time is capital. He likes to shine; society\nwill stimulate his desires until no money will satisfy them; instead\nof earning money, he will spend it. You have accustomed him to believe\nin his great powers, in fact, but the world at large declines to\nbelieve in any man's superior intellect until he has achieved some\nsignal success. Now success in literature is only won in solitude and\nby dogged work. What will Mme. de Bargeton give your brother in return\nfor so many days spent at her feet? Lucien has too much spirit to\naccept help from her; and he cannot afford, as we know, to cultivate\nher society, twice ruinous as it is for him. Sooner or later that\nwoman will throw over this dear brother of ours, but not before she\nhas spoiled him for hard work, and given him a taste for luxury and a\ncontempt for our humdrum life. She will develop his love of enjoyment,\nhis inclination for idleness, that debauches a poetic soul. Yes, it\nmakes me tremble to think that this great lady may make a plaything of\nLucien. If she cares for him sincerely, he will forget everything else\nfor her; or if she does not love him, she will make him unhappy, for\nhe is wild about her.\"\n\n\"You have sent a chill of dread through my heart,\" said Eve, stopping\nas they reached the weir. \"But so long as mother is strong enough for\nher tiring life, so long as I live, we shall earn enough, perhaps,\nbetween us to keep Lucien until success comes. My courage will never\nfail,\" said Eve, brightening. \"There is no hardship in work when we\nwork for one we love; it is not drudgery. It makes me happy to think\nthat I toil so much, if indeed it is toil, for him. Oh, do not be in\nthe least afraid, we will earn money enough to send Lucien into the\ngreat world. There lies his road to success.\"\n\n\"And there lies his road to ruin,\" returned David. \"Dear Eve, listen\nto me. A man needs an independent fortune, or the sublime cynicism of\npoverty, for the slow execution of great work. Believe me, Lucien's\nhorror of privation is so great, the savor of banquets, the incense of\nsuccess is so sweet in his nostrils, his self-love has grown so much\nin Mme. de Bargeton's boudoir, that he will do anything desperate\nsooner than fall back, and you will never earn enough for his\nrequirements.\n\n\"Then you are only a false friend to him!\" Eve cried in despair, \"or\nyou would not discourage us in this way.\"\n\n\"Eve! Eve!\" cried David, \"if only I could be a brother to Lucien! You\nalone can give me that title; he could accept anything from me then; I\nshould claim the right of devoting my life to him with the love that\nhallows your self-sacrifice, but with some worldly wisdom too. Eve, my\ndarling, give Lucien a store from which he need not blush to draw! His\nbrother's purse will be like his own, will it not? If you only knew\nall my thoughts about Lucien's position! If he means to go to Mme. de\nBargeton's, he must not be my foreman any longer, poor fellow! He\nought not to live in L'Houmeau; you ought not to be a working girl;\nand your mother must give up her employment as well. If you would\nconsent to be my wife, the difficulties will all be smoothed away.\nLucien might live on the second floor in the Place du Murier until I\ncan build rooms for him over the shed at the back of the yard (if my\nfather will allow it, that is.). And in that way we would arrange a\nfree and independent life for him. The wish to support Lucien will\ngive me a better will to work than I ever should have had for myself\nalone; but it rests with you to give me the right to devote myself to\nhim. Some day, perhaps, he will go to Paris, the only place that can\nbring out all that is in him, and where his talents will be\nappreciated and rewarded. Living in Paris is expensive, and the\nearnings of all three of us will be needed for his support. And\nbesides, will not you and your mother need some one to lean upon then?\nDear Eve, marry me for love of Lucien; perhaps afterwards you will\nlove me when you see how I shall strive to help him and to make you\nhappy. We are, both of us, equally simple in our tastes; we have few\nwants; Lucien's welfare shall be the great object of our lives. His\nheart shall be our treasure-house, we will lay up all our fortune, and\nthink and feel and hope in him.\"\n\n\"Worldly considerations keep us apart,\" said Eve, moved by this love\nthat tried to explain away its greatness. \"You are rich and I am poor.\nOne must love indeed to overcome such a difficulty.\"\n\n\"Then you do not care enough for me?\" cried the stricken David.\n\n\"But perhaps your father would object----\"\n\n\"Never mind,\" said David; \"if asking my father is all that is\nnecessary, you will be my wife. Eve, my dear Eve, how you have\nlightened life for me in a moment; and my heart has been very heavy\nwith thoughts that I could not utter, I did not know how to speak of\nthem. Only tell me that you care for me a little, and I will take\ncourage to tell you the rest.\"\n\n\"Indeed,\" she said, \"you make me quite ashamed; but confidence for\nconfidence, I will tell you this, that I have never thought of any one\nbut you in my life. I looked upon you as one of those men to whom a\nwoman might be proud to belong, and I did not dare to hope so great a\nthing for myself, a penniless working girl with no prospects.\"\n\n\"That is enough, that is enough,\" he answered, sitting down on the bar\nby the weir, for they had gone to and fro like mad creatures over the\nsame length of pathway.\n\n\"What is the matter?\" she asked, her voice expressing for the first\ntime a woman's sweet anxiety for one who belongs to her.\n\n\"Nothing but good,\" he answered. \"It is the sight of a whole lifetime\nof happiness that dazzles me, as it were; it is overwhelming. Why am I\nhappier than you?\" he asked, with a touch of sadness. \"For I know that\nI am happier.\"\n\nEve looked at David with mischievous, doubtful eyes that asked an\nexplanation.\n\n\"Dear Eve, I am taking more than I give. So I shall always love you\nmore than you love me, because I have more reason to love. You are an\nangel; I am a man.\"\n\n\"I am not so learned,\" Eve said, smiling. \"I love you----\"\n\n\"As much as you love Lucien?\" he broke in.\n\n\"Enough to be your wife, enough to devote myself to you, to try not to\nadd anything to your burdens, for we shall have some struggles; it\nwill not be quite easy at first.\"\n\n\"Dear Eve, have you known that I loved you since the first day I saw\nyou?\"\n\n\"Where is the woman who does not feel that she is loved?\"\n\n\"Now let me get rid of your scruples as to my imaginary riches. I am a\npoor man, dear. Yes, it pleased my father to ruin me; he made a\nspeculation of me, as a good many so-called benefactors do. If I make\na fortune, it will be entirely through you. That is not a lover's\nspeech, but sober, serious earnest. I ought to tell you about my\nfaults, for they are exceedingly bad ones in a man who has his way to\nmake. My character and habits and favorite occupations all unfit me\nfor business and money-getting, and yet we can only make money by some\nkind of industry; if I have some faculty for the discovery of\ngold-mines, I am singularly ill-adapted for getting the gold out of\nthem. But you who, for your brother's sake, went into the smallest\ndetails, with a talent for thrift, and the patient watchfulness of the\nborn man of business, you will reap the harvest that I shall sow. The\npresent state of things, for I have been like one of the family for a\nlong time, weighs so heavily upon me, that I have spent days and nights\nin search of some way of making a fortune. I know something of chemistry,\nand a knowledge of commercial requirements has put me on the scent of\na discovery that is likely to pay. I can say nothing as yet about it;\nthere will be a long while to wait; perhaps for some years we may have\na hard time of it; but I shall find out how to make a commercial\narticle at last. Others are busy making the same researches, and if I\nam first in the field, we shall have a large fortune. I have said\nnothing to Lucien, his enthusiastic nature would spoil everything; he\nwould convert my hopes into realities, and begin to live like a lord,\nand perhaps get into debt. So keep my secret for me. Your sweet and\ndear companionship will be consolation in itself during the long time\nof experiment, and the desire to gain wealth for you and Lucien will\ngive me persistence and tenacity----\"\n\n\"I had guessed this too,\" Eve said, interrupting him; \"I knew that you\nwere one of those inventors, like my poor father, who must have a\nwoman to take care of them.\"\n\n\"Then you love me! Ah! say so without fear to me, who saw a symbol of\nmy love for you in your name. Eve was the one woman in the world; if\nit was true in the outward world for Adam, it is true again in the\ninner world of my heart for me. My God! do you love me?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said she, lengthening out the word as if to make it cover the\nextent of feeling expressed by a single syllable.\n\n\"Well, let us sit here,\" he said, and taking Eve's hand, he went to a\ngreat baulk of timber lying below the wheels of a paper-mill. \"Let me\nbreathe the evening air, and hear the frogs croak, and watch the\nmoonlight quivering upon the river; let me take all this world about\nus into my soul, for it seems to me that my happiness is written large\nover it all; I am seeing it for the first time in all its splendor,\nlighted up by love, grown fair through you. Eve, dearest, this is the\nfirst moment of pure and unmixed joy that fate has given to me! I do\nnot think that Lucien can be as happy as I am.\"\n\nDavid felt Eve's hand, damp and quivering in his own, and a tear fell\nupon it.\n\n\"May I not know the secret?\" she pleaded coaxingly.\n\n\"You have a right to know it, for your father was interested in the\nmatter, and to-day it is a pressing question, and for this reason.\nSince the downfall of the Empire, calico has come more and more into\nuse, because it is so much cheaper than linen. At the present moment,\npaper is made of a mixture of hemp and linen rags, but the raw\nmaterial is dear, and the expense naturally retards the great advance\nwhich the French press is bound to make. Now you cannot increase the\noutput of linen rags, a given population gives a pretty constant\nresult, and it only increases with the birth-rate. To make any\nperceptible difference in the population for this purpose, it would\ntake a quarter of a century and a great revolution in habits of life,\ntrade, and agriculture. And if the supply of linen rags is not enough\nto meet one-half nor one-third of the demand, some cheaper material\nthan linen rags must be found for cheap paper. This deduction is based\non facts that came under my knowledge here. The Angouleme\npaper-makers, the last to use pure linen rags, say that the proportion\nof cotton in the pulp has increased to a frightful extent of late\nyears.\"\n\nIn answer to a question from Eve, who did not know what \"pulp\" meant,\nDavid gave an account of paper-making, which will not be out of place\nin a volume which owes its existence in book form to the paper\nindustry no less than to the printing-press; but the long digression,\ndoubtless, had best be condensed at first.\n\nPaper, an invention not less marvelous than the other dependent\ninvention of printing, was known in ancient times in China. Thence by\nthe unrecognized channels of commerce the art reached Asia Minor,\nwhere paper was made of cotton reduced to pulp and boiled. Parchment\nhad become so extremely dear that a cheap substitute was discovered in\nan imitation of the cotton paper known in the East as _charta\nbombycina_. The imitation, made from rags, was first made at Basel, in\n1170, by a colony of Greek refugees, according to some authorities; or\nat Padua, in 1301, by an Italian named Pax, according to others. In\nthese ways the manufacture of paper was perfected slowly and in\nobscurity; but this much is certain, that so early as the reign of\nCharles VI., paper pulp for playing-cards was made in Paris.\n\nWhen those immortals, Faust, Coster, and Gutenberg, invented the Book,\ncraftsmen as obscure as many a great artist of those times\nappropriated paper to the uses of typography. In the fifteenth\ncentury, that naive and vigorous age, names were given to the various\nformats as well as to the different sizes of type, names that bear the\nimpress of the naivete of the times; and the various sheets came to be\nknown by the different watermarks on their centres; the grapes, the\nfigure of our Saviour, the crown, the shield, or the flower-pot, just\nas at a later day, the eagle of Napoleon's time gave the name to the\n\"double-eagle\" size. And in the same way the types were called Cicero,\nSaint-Augustine, and Canon type, because they were first used to print\nthe treatises of Cicero and theological and liturgical works. Italics\nare so called because they were invented in Italy by Aldus of Venice.\n\nBefore the invention of machine-made paper, which can be woven in any\nlength, the largest sized sheets were the _grand jesus_ and the double\ncolumbier (this last being scarcely used now except for atlases or\nengravings), and the size of paper for printers' use was determined by\nthe dimensions of the impression-stone. When David explained these\nthings to Eve, web-paper was almost undreamed of in France, although,\nabout 1799, Denis Robert d'Essonne had invented a machine for turning\nout a ribbon of paper, and Didot-Saint-Leger had since tried to\nperfect it. The vellum paper invented by Ambroise Didot only dates\nback as far as 1780.\n\nThis bird's eye view of the history of the invention shows\nincontestably that great industrial and intellectual advances are made\nexceedingly slowly, and little by little, even as Nature herself\nproceeds. Perhaps articulate speech and the art of writing were\ngradually developed in the same groping way as typography and\npaper-making.\n\n\"Rag-pickers collect all the rags and old linen of Europe,\" the\nprinter concluded, \"and buy any kind of tissue. The rags are sorted\nand warehoused by the wholesale rag merchants, who supply the\npaper-mills. To give you some idea of the extent of the trade, you\nmust know, mademoiselle, that in 1814 Cardon the banker, owner of the\npulping troughs of Bruges and Langlee (where Leorier de l'Isle\nendeavored in 1776 to solve the very problem that occupied your\nfather), Cardon brought an action against one Proust for an error in\nweights of two millions in a total of ten million pounds' weight of\nrags, worth about four million francs! The manufacturer washes the\nrags and reduces them to a thin pulp, which is strained, exactly as a\ncook strains sauce through a tamis, through an iron frame with a fine\nwire bottom where the mark which give its name to the size of the\npaper is woven. The size of this _mould_, as it is called, regulates the\nsize of the sheet.\n\n\"When I was with the Messieurs Didot,\" David continued, \"they were\nvery much interested in this question, and they are still interested;\nfor the improvement which your father endeavored to make is a great\ncommercial requirement, and one of the crying needs of the time. And\nfor this reason: although linen lasts so much longer than cotton, that\nit is in reality cheaper in the end, the poor would rather make the\nsmaller outlay in the first instance, and, by virtue of the law of _Vae\nvictis!_ pay enormously more before they have done. The middle classes\ndo the same. So there is a scarcity of linen. In England, where\nfour-fifths of the population use cotton to the exclusion of linen,\nthey make nothing but cotton paper. The cotton paper is very soft and\neasily creased to begin with, and it has a further defect: it is so\nsoluble that if you seep a book made of cotton paper in water for\nfifteen minutes, it turns to a pulp, while an old book left in water\nfor a couple of hours is not spoilt. You could dry the old book, and\nthe pages, though yellow and faded, would still be legible, the work\nwould not be destroyed.\n\n\"There is a time coming when legislation will equalize our fortunes,\nand we shall all be poor together; we shall want our linen and our\nbooks to be cheap, just as people are beginning to prefer small\npictures because they have not wall space enough for large ones. Well,\nthe shirts and the books will not last, that is all; it is the same on\nall sides, solidity is drying out. So this problem is one of the first\nimportance for literature, science, and politics.\n\n\"One day, in my office, there was a hot discussion going on about the\nmaterial that the Chinese use for making paper. Their paper is far\nbetter than ours, because the raw material is better; and a good deal\nwas said about this thin, light Chinese paper, for if it is light and\nthin, the texture is close, there are no transparent spots in it. In\nParis there are learned men among the printers' readers; Fourier and\nPierre Leroux are Lachevardiere's readers at this moment; and the\nComte de Saint-Simon, who happened to be correcting proofs for us,\ncame in in the middle of the discussion. He told us at once that,\naccording to Kempfer and du Halde, the _Broussonetia_ furnishes the\nsubstance of the Chinese paper; it is a vegetable substance (like\nlinen or cotton for that matter). Another reader maintained that\nChinese paper was principally made of an animal substance, to wit, the\nsilk that is abundant there. They made a bet about it in my presence.\nThe Messieurs Didot are printers to the Institute, so naturally they\nreferred the question to that learned body. M. Marcel, who used to be\nsuperintendent of the Royal Printing Establishment, was umpire, and he\nsent the two readers to M. l'Abbe Grozier, Librarian at the Arsenal.\nBy the Abbe's decision they both lost their wages. The paper was not\nmade of silk nor yet from the _Broussonetia_; the pulp proved to be the\ntriturated fibre of some kind of bamboo. The Abbe Grozier had a\nChinese book, an iconographical and technological work, with a great\nmany pictures in it, illustrating all the different processes of\npaper-making, and he showed us a picture of the workshop with the\nbamboo stalks lying in a heap in the corner; it was extremely well\ndrawn.\n\n\"Lucien told me that your father, with the intuition of a man of\ntalent, had a glimmering of a notion of some way of replacing linen\nrags with an exceedingly common vegetable product, not previously\nmanufactured, but taken direct from the soil, as the Chinese use\nvegetable fibre at first hand. I have classified the guesses made by\nthose who came before me, and have begun to study the question. The\nbamboo is a kind of reed; naturally I began to think of the reeds that\ngrow here in France.\n\n\"Labor is very cheap in China, where a workman earns three halfpence a\nday, and this cheapness of labor enables the Chinese to manipulate\neach sheet of paper separately. They take it out of the mould, and\npress it between heated tablets of white porcelain, that is the secret\nof the surface and consistence, the lightness and satin smoothness of\nthe best paper in the world. Well, here in Europe the work must be\ndone by machinery; machinery must take the place of cheap Chinese\nlabor. If we could but succeed in making a cheap paper of as good a\nquality, the weight and thickness of printed books would be reduced by\nmore than one-half. A set of Voltaire, printed on our woven paper and\nbound, weighs about two hundred and fifty pounds; it would only weigh\nfifty if we used Chinese paper. That surely would be a triumph, for\nthe housing of many books has come to be a difficulty; everything has\ngrown smaller of late; this is not an age of giants; men have shrunk,\neverything about them shrinks, and house-room into the bargain. Great\nmansions and great suites of rooms will be abolished sooner or later\nin Paris, for no one will afford to live in the great houses built by\nour forefathers. What a disgrace for our age if none of its books\nshould last! Dutch paper--that is, paper made from flax--will be quite\nunobtainable in ten years' time. Well, your brother told me of this\nidea of your father's, this plan for using vegetable fibre in\npaper-making, so you see that if I succeed, you have a right to----\"\n\nLucien came up at that moment and interrupted David's generous\nassertion.\n\n\"I do not know whether you have found the evening pleasant,\" said he;\n\"it has been a cruel time for me.\"\n\n\"Poor Lucien! what can have happened?\" cried Eve, as she saw her\nbrother's excited face.\n\nThe poet told the history of his agony, pouring out a flood of\nclamorous thoughts into those friendly hearts, Eve and David listening\nin pained silence to a torrent of woes that exhibited such greatness\nand such pettiness.\n\n\"M. de Bargeton is an old dotard. The indigestion will carry him off\nbefore long, no doubt,\" Lucien said, as he made an end, \"and then I\nwill look down on these proud people; I will marry Mme. de Bargeton. I\nread to-night in her eyes a love as great as mine for her. Yes, she\nfelt all that I felt; she comforted me; she is as great and noble as\nshe is gracious and beautiful. She will never give me up.\"\n\n\"It is time that life was made smooth for him, is it not?\" murmured\nDavid, and for answer Eve pressed his arm without speaking. David\nguessed her thoughts, and began at once to tell Lucien about his own\nplans.\n\nIf Lucien was full of his troubles, the lovers were quite as full of\nthemselves. So absorbed were they, so eager that Lucien should approve\ntheir happiness, that neither Eve nor David so much as noticed his\nstart of surprise at the news. Mme. de Bargeton's lover had been\ndreaming of a great match for his sister; he would reach a high\nposition first, and then secure himself by an alliance with some\nfamily of influence, and here was one more obstacle in his way to\nsuccess! His hopes were dashed to the ground. \"If Mme. de Bargeton\nconsents to be Mme. de Rubempre, she would never care to have David\nSechard for a brother-in-law!\"\n\nThis stated clearly and precisely was the thought that tortured\nLucien's inmost mind. \"Louise is right!\" he thought bitterly. \"A man\nwith a career before him is never understood by his family.\"\n\nIf the marriage had not been announced immediately after Lucien's\nfancy had put M. de Bargeton to death, he would have been radiant with\nheartfelt delight at the news. If he had thought soberly over the\nprobable future of a beautiful and penniless girl like Eve Chardon, he\nwould have seen that this marriage was a piece of unhoped-for good\nfortune. But he was living just now in a golden dream; he had soared\nabove all barriers on the wings of an _if_; he had seen a vision of\nhimself, rising above society; and it was painful to drop so suddenly\ndown to hard fact.\n\nEve and David both thought that their brother was overcome with the\nsense of such generosity; to them, with their noble natures, the\nsilent consent was a sign of true friendship. David began to describe\nwith kindly and cordial eloquence the happy fortunes in store for them\nall. Unchecked by protests put in by Eve, he furnished his first floor\nwith a lover's lavishness, built a second floor with boyish good faith\nfor Lucien, and rooms above the shed for Mme. Chardon--he meant to be\na son to her. In short, he made the whole family so happy and his\nbrother-in-law so independent, that Lucien fell under the spell of\nDavid's voice and Eve's caresses; and as they went through the shadows\nbeside the still Charente, a gleam in the warm, star-lit night, he\nforgot the sharp crown of thorns that had been pressed upon his head.\n\"M. de Rubempre\" discovered David's real nature, in fact. His facile\ncharacter returned almost at once to the innocent, hard-working\nburgher life that he knew; he saw it transfigured and free from care.\nThe buzz of the aristocratic world grew more and more remote; and when\nat length they came upon the paved road of L'Houmeau, the ambitious\npoet grasped his brother's hand, and made a third in the joy of the\nhappy lovers.\n\n\"If only your father makes no objection to the marriage,\" he said.\n\n\"You know how much he troubles himself about me; the old man lives for\nhimself,\" said David. \"But I will go over to Marsac to-morrow and see\nhim, if it is only to ask leave to build.\"\n\nDavid went back to the house with the brother and sister, and asked\nMme. Chardon's consent to his marriage with the eagerness of a man who\nwould fain have no delay. Eve's mother took her daughter's hand, and\ngladly laid it in David's; and the lover, grown bolder on this, kissed\nhis fair betrothed on the forehead, and she flushed red, and smiled at\nhim.\n\n\"The betrothal of the poor,\" the mother said, raising her eyes as if\nto pray for heaven's blessing upon them.--\"You are brave, my boy,\" she\nadded, looking at David, \"but we have fallen on evil fortune, and I am\nafraid lest our bad luck should be infectious.\"\n\n\"We shall be rich and happy,\" David said earnestly. \"To begin with,\nyou must not go out nursing any more, and you must come and live with\nyour daughter and Lucien in Angouleme.\"\n\nThe three began at once to tell the astonished mother all their\ncharming plans, and the family party gave themselves up to the\npleasure of chatting and weaving a romance, in which it is so pleasant\nto enjoy future happiness, and to store the unsown harvest. They had\nto put David out at the door; he could have wished the evening to last\nfor ever, and it was one o'clock in the morning when Lucien and his\nfuture brother-in-law reached the Palet Gate. The unwonted movement\nmade honest Postel uneasy; he opened the window, and looking through\nthe Venetian shutters, he saw a light in Eve's room.\n\n\"What can be happening at the Chardons'?\" thought he, and seeing\nLucien come in, he called out to him--\n\n\"What is the matter, sonny? Do you want me to do anything?\"\n\n\"No, sir,\" returned the poet; \"but as you are our friend, I can tell\nyou about it; my mother has just given her consent to my sister's\nengagement to David Sechard.\"\n\nFor all answer, Postel shut the window with a bang, in despair that he\nhad not asked for Mlle. Chardon earlier.\n\nDavid, however, did not go back into Angouleme; he took the road to\nMarsac instead, and walked through the night the whole way to his\nfather's house. He went along by the side of the croft just as the sun\nrose, and caught sight of the old \"bear's\" face under an almond-tree\nthat grew out of the hedge.\n\n\"Good day, father,\" called David.\n\n\"Why, is it you, my boy? How come you to be out on the road at this\ntime of day? There is your way in,\" he added, pointing to a little\nwicket gate. \"My vines have flowered and not a shoot has been frosted.\nThere will be twenty puncheons or more to the acre this year; but then\nlook at all the dung that has been put on the land!\"\n\n\"Father, I have come on important business.\"\n\n\"Very well; how are your presses doing? You must be making heaps of\nmoney as big as yourself.\"\n\n\"I shall some day, father, but I am not very well off just now.\"\n\n\"They all tell me that I ought not to put on so much manure,\" replied\nhis father. \"The gentry, that is M. le Marquis, M. le Comte, and\nMonsieur What-do-you-call-'em, say that I am letting down the quality\nof the wine. What is the good of book-learning except to muddle your\nwits? Just you listen: these gentlemen get seven, or sometimes eight\npuncheons of wine to the acre, and they sell them for sixty francs\napiece, that means four hundred francs per acre at most in a good\nyear. Now, I make twenty puncheons, and get thirty francs apiece for\nthem--that is six hundred francs! And where are they, the fools?\nQuality, quality, what is quality to me? They can keep their quality\nfor themselves, these Lord Marquises. Quality means hard cash for me,\nthat is what it means, You were saying?----\"\n\n\"I am going to be married, father, and I have come to ask for----\"\n\n\"Ask me for what? Nothing of the sort, my boy. Marry; I give you my\nconsent, but as for giving you anything else, I haven't a penny to\nbless myself with. Dressing the soil is the ruin of me. These two\nyears I have been paying money out of pocket for top-dressing, and\ntaxes, and expenses of all kinds; Government eats up everything,\nnearly all the profit goes to the Government. The poor growers have\nmade nothing these last two seasons. This year things don't look so\nbad; and, of course, the beggarly puncheons have gone up to eleven\nfrancs already. We work to put money into the coopers' pockets. Why,\nare you going to marry before the vintage?----\"\n\n\"I only came to ask for your consent, father.\"\n\n\"Oh! that is another thing. And who is the victim, if one may ask?\"\n\n\"I am going to marry Mlle. Eve Chardon.\"\n\n\"Who may she be? What kind of victual does she eat?\"\n\n\"She is the daughter of the late M. Chardon, the druggist in\nL'Houmeau.\"\n\n\"You are going to marry a girl out of L'Houmeau! _you_! a burgess of\nAngouleme, and printer to His Majesty! This is what comes of\nbook-learning! Send a boy to school, forsooth! Oh! well, then she is\nvery rich, is she, my boy?\" and the old vinegrower came up closer with\na cajoling manner; \"if you are marrying a girl out of L'Houmeau, it\nmust be because she has lots of cash, eh? Good! you will pay me my rent\nnow. There are two years and one-quarter owing, you know, my boy; that\nis two thousand seven hundred francs altogether; the money will come\njust in the nick of time to pay the cooper. If it was anybody else, I\nshould have a right to ask for interest; for, after all, business is\nbusiness, but I will let you off the interest. Well, how much has\nshe?\"\n\n\"Just as much as my mother had.\"\n\nThe old vinegrower very nearly said, \"Then she has only ten thousand\nfrancs!\" but he recollected just in time that he had declined to give\nan account of her fortune to her son, and exclaimed, \"She has\nnothing!\"\n\n\"My mother's fortune was her beauty and intelligence,\" said David.\n\n\"You just go into the market and see what you can get for it! Bless my\nbuttons! what bad luck parents have with their children. David, when I\nmarried, I had a paper cap on my head for my whole fortune, and a pair\nof arms; I was a poor pressman; but with the fine printing-house that\nI gave you, with your industry, and your education, you might marry a\nburgess' daughter, a woman with thirty or forty thousand francs. Give\nup your fancy, and I will find you a wife myself. There is some one\nabout three miles away, a miller's widow, thirty-two years old, with a\nhundred thousand francs in land. There is your chance! You can add her\nproperty to Marsac, for they touch. Ah! what a fine property we should\nhave, and how I would look after it! They say she is going to marry\nher foreman Courtois, but you are the better man of the two. I would\nlook after the mill, and she should live like a lady up in Angouleme.\"\n\n\"I am engaged, father.\"\n\n\"David, you know nothing of business; you will ruin yourself, I see.\nYes, if you marry this girl out of L'Houmeau, I shall square accounts\nand summons you for the rent, for I see that no good will come of\nthis. Oh! my presses, my poor presses! it took some money to grease\nyou and keep you going. Nothing but a good year can comfort me after\nthis.\"\n\n\"It seems to me, father, that until now I have given you very little\ntrouble----\"\n\n\"And paid mighty little rent,\" put in his parent.\n\n\"I came to ask you something else besides. Will you build a second\nfloor to your house, and some rooms above the shed?\"\n\n\"Deuce a bit of it; I have not the cash, and that you know right well.\nBesides, it would be money thrown clean away, for what would it bring\nin? Oh! you get up early of a morning to come and ask me to build you\na place that would ruin a king, do you? Your name may be David, but I\nhave not got Solomon's treasury. Why, you are mad! or they changed my\nchild at nurse. There is one for you that will have grapes on it,\" he\nsaid, interrupting himself to point out a shoot. \"Offspring of this\nsort don't disappoint their parents; you dung the vines, and they\nrepay you for it. I sent you to school; I spent any amount of money to\nmake a scholar of you; I sent you to the Didots to learn your\nbusiness; and all this fancy education ends in a daughter-in-law out\nof L'Houmeau without a penny to her name. If you had not studied\nbooks, if I had kept you under my eye, you would have done as I\npleased, and you would be marrying a miller's widow this day with a\nhundred thousand francs in hand, to say nothing of the mill. Oh! your\ncleverness leads you to imagine that I am going to reward this fine\nsentiment by building palaces for you, does it? . . . Really, anybody\nmight think that the house that has been a house these two hundred\nyears was nothing but a pigsty, not fit for the girl out of L'Houmeau\nto sleep in! What next! She is the Queen of France, I suppose.\"\n\n\"Very well, father, I will build the second floor myself; the son will\nimprove his father's property. It is not the usual way, but it happens\nso sometimes.\"\n\n\"What, my lad! you can find money for building, can you, though you\ncan't find money to pay the rent, eh! You sly dog, to come round your\nfather.\"\n\nThe question thus raised was hard to lay, for the old man was only too\ndelighted to seize an opportunity of posing as a good father without\ndisbursing a penny; and all that David could obtain was his bare\nconsent to the marriage and free leave to do what he liked in the\nhouse--at his own expense; the old \"bear,\" that pattern of a thrifty\nparent, kindly consenting not to demand the rent and drain the savings\nto which David imprudently owned. David went back again in low\nspirits. He saw that he could not reckon on his father's help in\nmisfortune.\n\n\n\nIn Angouleme that day people talked of nothing but the Bishop's\nepigram and Mme. de Bargeton's reply. Every least thing that happened\nthat evening was so much exaggerated and embellished and twisted out\nof all knowledge, that the poet became the hero of the hour. While\nthis storm in a teacup raged on high, a few drops fell among the\n_bourgeoisie_; young men looked enviously after Lucien as he passed on\nhis way through Beaulieu, and he overheard chance phrases that filled\nhim with conceit.\n\n\"There is a lucky young fellow!\" said an attorney's clerk, named\nPetit-Claud, a plain-featured youth who had been at school with\nLucien, and treated him with small, patronizing airs.\n\n\"Yes, he certainly is,\" answered one of the young men who had been\npresent on the occasion of the reading; \"he is a good-looking fellow,\nhe has some brains, and Mme. de Bargeton is quite wild about him.\"\n\nLucien had waited impatiently until he could be sure of finding Louise\nalone. He had to break the tidings of his sister's marriage to the\narbitress of his destinies. Perhaps after yesterday's soiree, Louise\nwould be kinder than usual, and her kindness might lead to a moment of\nhappiness. So he thought, and he was not mistaken; Mme. de Bargeton\nmet him with a vehemence of sentiment that seemed like a touching\nprogress of passion to the novice in love. She abandoned her hands,\nher beautiful golden hair, to the burning kisses of the poet who had\npassed through such an ordeal.\n\n\"If only you could have seen your face whilst you were reading,\" cried\nLouise, using the familiar _tu_, the caress of speech, since yesterday,\nwhile her white hands wiped the pearls of sweat from the brows on\nwhich she set a poet's crown. \"There were sparks of fire in those\nbeautiful eyes! From your lips, as I watched them, there fell the\ngolden chains that suspend the hearts of men upon the poet's mouth.\nYou shall read Chenier through to me from beginning to end; he is the\nlover's poet. You shall not be unhappy any longer; I will not have it.\nYes, dear angel, I will make an oasis for you, there you shall live\nyour poet's life, sometimes busy, sometimes languid; indolent, full of\nwork, and musing by turns; but never forget that you owe your laurels\nto me, let that thought be my noble guerdon for the sufferings which I\nmust endure. Poor love! the world will not spare me any more than it\nhas spared you; the world is avenged on all happiness in which it has\nno share. Yes, I shall always be a mark for envy--did you not see that\nlast night? The bloodthirsty insects are quick enough to drain every\nwound that they pierce. But I was happy; I lived. It is so long since\nall my heartstrings vibrated.\"\n\nThe tears flowed fast, and for all answer Lucien took Louise's hand\nand gave it a lingering kiss. Every one about him soothed and caressed\nthe poet's vanity; his mother and his sister and David and Louise now\ndid the same. Every one helped to raise the imaginary pedestal on\nwhich he had set himself. His friends's kindness and the fury of his\nenemies combined to establish him more firmly in an ureal world. A\nyoung imagination readily falls in with the flattering estimates of\nothers, a handsome young fellow so full of promise finds others eager\nto help him on every side, and only after one or two sharp and bitter\nlessons does he begin to see himself as an ordinary mortal.\n\n\"My beautiful Louise, do you mean in very truth to be my Beatrice, a\nBeatrice who condescends to be loved?\"\n\nLouise raised the fine eyes, hitherto down-dropped.\n\n\"If you show yourself worthy--some day!\" she said, with an angelic\nsmile which belied her words. \"Are you not happy? To be the sole\npossessor of a heart, to speak freely at all times, with the certainty\nof being understood, is not this happiness?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" he answered, with a lover's pout of vexation.\n\n\"Child!\" she exclaimed, laughing at him. \"Come, you have something to\ntell me, have you not? You came in absorbed in thought, my Lucien.\"\n\nLucien, in fear and trembling, confided to his beloved that David was\nin love with his sister Eve, and that his sister Eve was in love with\nDavid, and that the two were to be married shortly.\n\n\"Poor Lucien!\" said Louise, \"he was afraid he should be beaten and\nscolded, as if it was he himself that was going to be married! Why,\nwhere is the harm?\" she continued, her fingers toying with Lucien's\nhair. \"What is your family to me when you are an exception? Suppose\nthat my father were to marry his cook, would that trouble you much?\nDear boy, lovers are for each other their whole family. Have I a\ngreater interest than my Lucien in the world? Be great, find the way\nto win fame, that is our affair!\"\n\nThis selfish answer made Lucien the happiest of mortals. But in the\nmiddle of the fantastic reasonings, with which Louise convinced him\nthat they two were alone in the world, in came M. de Bargeton. Lucien\nfrowned and seemed to be taken aback, but Louise made him a sign, and\nasked him to stay to dinner and to read Andre de Chenier aloud to them\nuntil people arrived for their evening game at cards.\n\n\"You will give her pleasure,\" said M. de Bargeton, \"and me also.\nNothing suits me better than listening to reading aloud after dinner.\"\n\nCajoled by M. de Bargeton, cajoled by Louise, waited upon with the\nrespect which servants show to a favored guest of the house, Lucien\nremained in the Hotel de Bargeton, and began to think of the luxuries\nwhich he enjoyed for the time being as the rightful accessories of\nLucien de Rubempre. He felt his position so strong through Louise's\nlove and M. de Bargeton's weakness, that as the rooms filled, he\nassumed a lordly air, which that fair lady encouraged. He tasted the\ndelights of despotic sway which Nais had acquired by right of\nconquest, and liked to share with him; and, in short, that evening he\ntried to act up to the part of the lion of the little town. A few of\nthose who marked these airs drew their own conclusions from them, and\nthought that, according to the old expression, he had come to the last\nterm with the lady. Amelie, who had come with M. du Chatelet, was sure\nof the deplorable fact, in a corner of the drawing-room, where the\njealous and envious gathered together.\n\n\"Do not think of calling Nais to account for the vanity of a\nyoungster, who is as proud as he can be because he has got into\nsociety, where he never expected to set foot,\" said Chatelet. \"Don't\nyou see that this Chardon takes the civility of a woman of the world\nfor an advance? He does not know the difference between the silence of\nreal passion and the patronizing graciousness due to his good looks\nand youth and talent. It would be too bad if women were blamed for all\nthe desires which they inspire. _He_ certainly is in love with her, but\nas for Nais----\"\n\n\"Oh! Nais,\" echoed the perfidious Amelie, \"Nais is well enough\npleased. A young man's love has so many attractions--at her age. A\nwoman grows young again in his company; she is a girl, and acts a\ngirl's hesitation and manners, and does not dream that she is\nridiculous. Just look! Think of a druggist's son giving himself a\nconqueror's airs with Mme. de Bargeton.\"\n\n\"Love knows nought of high or low degree,\" hummed Adrien.\n\nThere was not a single house in Angouleme next day where the degree of\nintimacy between M. Chardon (alias de Rubempre) and Mme. de Bargeton\nwas not discussed; and though the utmost extent of their guilt\namounted to two or three kisses, the world already chose to believe\nthe worst of both. Mme. de Bargeton paid the penalty of her\nsovereignty. Among the various eccentricities of society, have you\nnever noticed its erratic judgments and the unaccountable differences\nin the standard it requires of this or that man or woman? There are\nsome persons who may do anything; they may behave totally\nirrationally, anything becomes them, and it is who shall be first to\njustify their conduct; then, on the other hand, there are those on\nwhom the world is unaccountably severe, they must do everything well,\nthey are not allowed to fail nor to make mistakes, at their peril they\ndo anything foolish; you might compare these last to the much-admired\nstatues which must come down at once from their pedestal if the frost\nchips off a nose or a finger. They are not permitted to be human; they\nare required to be for ever divine and for ever impeccable. So one\nglance exchanged between Mme. de Bargeton and Lucien outweighed twelve\nyears of Zizine's connection with Francis in the social balance; and a\nsqueeze of the hand drew down all the thunders of the Charente upon\nthe lovers.\n\nDavid had brought a little secret hoard back with him from Paris, and\nit was this sum that he set aside for the expenses of his marriage and\nfor the building of the second floor in his father's house. His\nfather's house it was; but, after all, was he not working for himself?\nIt would all be his again some day, and his father was sixty-eight\nyears old. So David build a timbered second story for Lucien, so as\nnot to put too great a strain on the old rifted house-walls. He took\npleasure in making the rooms where the fair Eve was to spend her life\nas brave as might be.\n\nIt was a time of blithe and unmixed happiness for the friends. Lucien\nwas tired of the shabbiness of provincial life, and weary of the\nsordid frugality that looked on a five-franc piece as a fortune, but\nhe bore the hardships and the pinching thrift without grumbling. His\nmoody looks had been succeeded by an expression of radiant hope. He\nsaw the star shining above his head, he had dreams of a great time to\ncome, and built the fabric of his good fortune on M. de Bargeton's\ntomb. M. de Bargeton, troubled with indigestion from time to time,\ncherished the happy delusion that indigestion after dinner was a\ncomplaint to be cured by a hearty supper.\n\nBy the beginning of September, Lucien had ceased to be a printer's\nforeman; he was M. de Rubempre, housed sumptuously in comparison with\nhis late quarters in the tumbledown attic with the dormer-window,\nwhere \"young Chardon\" had lived in L'Houmeau; he was not even a \"man\nof L'Houmeau\"; he lived in the heights of Angouleme, and dined four\ntimes a week with Mme. de Bargeton. A friendship had grown up between\nM. de Rubempre and the Bishop, and he went to the palace. His\noccupations put him upon a level with the highest rank; his name would\nbe one day among the great names of France; and, in truth, as he went\nto and fro in his apartments, the pretty sitting-room, the charming\nbedroom, and the tastefully furnished study, he might console himself\nfor the thought that he drew thirty francs every month out of his\nmother's and sister's hard earnings; for he saw the day approaching\nwhen _An Archer of Charles IX._, the historical romance on which he had\nbeen at work for two years, and a volume of verse entitled\n_Marguerites_, should spread his fame through the world of literature,\nand bring in money enough to repay them all, his mother and sister and\nDavid. So, grown great in his own eyes, and giving ear to the echoes\nof his name in the future, he could accept present sacrifices with\nnoble assurance; he smiled at his poverty, he relished the sense of\nthese last days of penury.\n\nEve and David had set Lucien's happiness before their own. They had\nput off their wedding, for it took some time to paper and paint their\nrooms, and to buy the furniture, and Lucien's affairs had been settled\nfirst. No one who knew Lucien could wonder at their devotion. Lucien\nwas so engaging, he had such winning ways, his impatience and his\ndesires were so graciously expressed, that his cause was always won\nbefore he opened his mouth to speak. This unlucky gift of fortune, if\nit is the salvation of some, is the ruin of many more. Lucien and his\nlike find a world predisposed in favor of youth and good looks, and\nready to protect those who give it pleasure with the selfish\ngood-nature that flings alms to a beggar, if he appeals to the feelings\nand awakens emotion; and in this favor many a grown child is content to\nbask instead of putting it to a profitable use. With mistaken notions\nas to the significance and the motive of social relations they imagine\nthat they shall always meet with deceptive smiles; and so at last the\nmoment comes for them when the world leaves them bald, stripped bare,\nwithout fortune or worth, like an elderly coquette by the door of a\nsalon, or a stray rag in the gutter.\n\nEve herself had wished for the delay. She meant to establish the\nlittle household on the most economical footing, and to buy only\nstrict necessaries; but what could two lovers refuse to a brother who\nwatched his sister at her work, and said in tones that came from the\nheart, \"How I wish I could sew!\" The sober, observant David had shared\nin the devotion; and yet, since Lucien's triumph, David had watched\nhim with misgivings; he was afraid that Lucien would change towards\nthem, afraid that he would look down upon their homely ways. Once or\ntwice, to try his brother, David had made him choose between home\npleasures and the great world, and saw that Lucien gave up the\ndelights of vanity for them, and exclaimed to himself, \"They will not\nspoil him for us!\" Now and again the three friends and Mme. Chardon\narranged picnic parties in provincial fashion--a walk in the woods\nalong the Charente, not far from Angouleme, and dinner out on the\ngrass, David's apprentice bringing the basket of provisions to some\nplace appointed before-hand; and at night they would come back, tired\nsomewhat, but the whole excursion had not cost three francs. On great\noccasion, when they dined at a _restaurat_, as it is called, a sort of a\ncountry inn, a compromise between a provincial wineshop and a Parisian\n_guinguette_, they would spend as much as five francs, divided between\nDavid and the Chardons. David gave his brother infinite credit for\nforsaking Mme. de Bargeton and grand dinners for these days in the\ncountry, and the whole party made much of the great man of Angouleme.\n\nMatters had gone so far, that the new home was very nearly ready, and\nDavid had gone over to Marsac to persuade his father to come to the\nwedding, not without a hope that the old man might relent at the sight\nof his daughter-in-law, and give something towards the heavy expenses\nof the alterations, when there befell one of those events which\nentirely change the face of things in a small town.\n\nLucien and Louise had a spy in Chatelet, a spy who watched, with the\npersistence of a hate in which avarice and passion are blended, for an\nopportunity of making a scandal. Sixte meant that Mme. de Bargeton\nshould compromise herself with Lucien in such a way that she should be\n\"lost,\" as the saying goes; so he posed as Mme. de Bargeton's humble\nconfidant, admired Lucien in the Rue du Minage, and pulled him to\npieces everywhere else. Nais had gradually given him _les petites\nentrees_, in the language of the court, for the lady no longer\nmistrusted her elderly admirer; but Chatelet had taken too much for\ngranted--love was still in the Platonic stage, to the great despair of\nLouise and Lucien.\n\nThere are, for that matter, love affairs which start with a good or a\nbad beginning, as you prefer to take it. Two creatures launch into the\ntactics of sentiment; they talk when they should be acting, and\nskirmish in the open instead of settling down to a siege. And so they\ngrow tired of one another, expend their longings in empty space; and,\nhaving time for reflection, come to their own conclusions about each\nother. Many a passion that has taken the field in gorgeous array, with\ncolors flying and an ardor fit to turn the world upside down, has\nturned home again without a victory, inglorious and crestfallen,\ncutting but a foolish figure after these vain alarums and excursions.\nSuch mishaps are sometimes due to the diffidence of youth, sometimes\nto the demurs of an inexperienced woman, for old players at this game\nseldom end in a fiasco of this kind.\n\nProvincial life, moreover, is singularly well calculated to keep\ndesire unsatisfied and maintain a lover's arguments on the\nintellectual plane, while, at the same time, the very obstacles placed\nin the way of the sweet intercourse which binds lovers so closely each\nto each, hurry ardent souls on towards extreme measures. A system of\nespionage of the most minute and intricate kind underlies provincial\nlife; every house is transparent, the solace of close friendships\nwhich break no moral law is scarcely allowed; and such outrageously\nscandalous constructions are put upon the most innocent human\nintercourse, that many a woman's character is taken away without\ncause. One here and there, weighed down by her unmerited punishment,\nwill regret that she has never known to the full the forbidden\nfelicity for which she is suffering. The world, which blames and\ncriticises with a superficial knowledge of the patent facts in which a\nlong inward struggle ends, is in reality a prime agent in bringing\nsuch scandals about; and those whose voices are loudest in\ncondemnation of the alleged misconduct of some slandered woman never\ngive a thought to the immediate provocation of the overt step. That\nstep many a woman only takes after she has been unjustly accused and\ncondemned, and Mme. de Bargeton was now on the verge of this anomalous\nposition.\n\nThe obstacles at the outset of a passion of this kind are alarming to\ninexperience, and those in the way of the two lovers were very like\nthe bonds by which the population of Lilliput throttled Gulliver, a\nmultiplicity of nothings, which made all movement impossible, and\nbaffle the most vehement desires. Mme. de Bargeton, for instance, must\nalways be visible. If she had denied herself to visitors when Lucien\nwas with her, it would have been all over with her; she might as well\nhave run away with him at once. It is true that they sat in the\nboudoir, now grown so familiar to Lucien that he felt as if he had a\nright to be there; but the doors stood scrupulously open, and\neverything was arranged with the utmost propriety. M. de Bargeton\npervaded the house like a cockchafer; it never entered his head that\nhis wife could wish to be alone with Lucien. If he had been the only\nperson in the way, Nais could have got rid of him, sent him out of the\nhouse, or given him something to do; but he was not the only one;\nvisitors flocked in upon her, and so much the more as curiosity\nincreased, for your provincial has a natural bent for teasing, and\ndelights to thwart a growing passion. The servants came and went about\nthe house promiscuously and without a summons; they had formed the\nhabits with a mistress who had nothing to conceal; any change now made\nin her household ways was tantamount to a confession, and Angouleme\nstill hung in doubt.\n\nMme. de Bargeton could not set foot outside her house but the whole\ntown knew whither she was going. To take a walk alone with Lucien out\nof Angouleme would have been a decided measure, indeed; it would have\nbeen less dangerous to shut herself up with him in the house. There\nwould have been comments the next day if Lucien had stayed on till\nmidnight after the rooms were emptied. Within as without her house,\nMme. de Bargeton lived in public.\n\nThese details describe life in the provinces; an intrigue is either\nopenly avoided or impossible anywhere.\n\nLike all women carried away for the first time by passion, Louise\ndiscovered the difficulties of her position one by one. They\nfrightened her, and her terror reacted upon the fond talk that fills\nthe fairest hours which lovers spend alone together. Mme. de Bargeton\nhad no country house whither she could take her beloved poet, after\nthe manner of some women who will forge ingenious pretexts for burying\nthemselves in the wilderness; but, weary of living in public, and\npushed to extremities by a tyranny which afforded no pleasures sweet\nenough to compensate for the heaviness of the yoke, she even thought\nof Escarbas, and of going to see her aged father--so much irritated\nwas she by these paltry obstacles.\n\nChatelet did not believe in such innocence. He lay in wait, and\nwatched Lucien into the house, and followed a few minutes later,\nalways taking M. de Chandour, the most indiscreet person in the\nclique, along with him; and, putting that gentleman first, hoped to\nfind a surprise by such perseverance in pursuit of the chance. His own\npart was a very difficult one to play, and its success was the more\ndoubtful because he was bound to appear neutral if he was to prompt\nthe other actors who were to play in his drama. So, to give himself a\ncountenance, he had attached himself to the jealous Amelie, the better\nto lull suspicion in Lucien and in Mme. de Bargeton, who was not\nwithout perspicacity. In order to spy upon the pair, he had contrived\nof late to open up a stock controversy on the point with M. de\nChandour. Chatelet said that Mme. de Bargeton was simply amusing\nherself with Lucien; she was too proud, too high-born, to stoop to the\napothecary's son. The role of incredulity was in accordance with the\nplan which he had laid down, for he wished to appear as Mme. de\nBargeton's champion. Stanislas de Chandour held that Mme. de Bargeton\nhad not been cruel to her lover, and Amelie goaded them to argument,\nfor she longed to know the truth. Each stated his case, and (as not\nunfrequently happens in small country towns) some intimate friends of\nthe house dropped in in the middle of the argument. Stanislas and\nChatelet vied with each other in backing up their opinions by\nobservations extremely pertinent. It was hardly to be expected that\nthe champions should not seek to enlist partisans. \"What do you\nyourself think?\" they asked, each of his neighbor. These polemics kept\nMme. de Bargeton and Lucien well in sight.\n\nAt length one day Chatelet called attention to the fact that whenever\nhe went with M. de Chandour to Mme. de Bargeton's and found Lucien\nthere, there was not a sign nor a trace of anything suspicious; the\nboudoir door stood open, the servants came and went, there was nothing\nmysterious to betray the sweet crime of love, and so forth and so\nforth. Stanislas, who did not lack a certain spice of stupidity in his\ncomposition, vowed that he would cross the room on tiptoe the next\nday, and the perfidious Amelie held him to his bargain.\n\nFor Lucien that morrow was the day on which a young man tugs out some\nof the hairs of his head, and inwardly vows that he will give up the\nfoolish business of sighing. He was accustomed to his situation. The\npoet, who had seated himself so bashfully in the boudoir-sanctuary of\nthe queen of Angouleme, had been transformed into an urgent lover. Six\nmonths had been enough to bring him on a level with Louise, and now he\nwould fain be her lord and master. He left home with a settled\ndetermination to be extravagant in his behavior; he would say that it\nwas a matter of life or death to him; he would bring all the resources\nof torrid eloquence into play; he would cry that he had lost his head,\nthat he could not think, could not write a line. The horror that some\nwomen feel for premeditation does honor to their delicacy; they would\nrather surrender upon the impulse of passion, than in fulfilment of a\ncontract. In general, prescribed happiness is not the kind that any of\nus desire.\n\nMme. de Bargeton read fixed purpose in Lucien's eyes and forehead, and\nin the agitation in his face and manner, and proposed to herself to\nbaffle him, urged thereto partly by a spirit of contradiction, partly\nalso by an exalted conception of love. Being given to exaggeration,\nshe set an exaggerated value upon her person. She looked upon herself\nas a sovereign lady, a Beatrice, a Laura. She enthroned herself, like\nsome dame of the Middle Ages, upon a dais, looking down upon the\ntourney of literature, and meant that Lucien, as in duty bound, should\nwin her by his prowess in the field; he must eclipse \"the sublime\nchild,\" and Lamartine, and Sir Walter Scott, and Byron. The noble\ncreature regarded her love as a stimulating power; the desire which\nshe had kindled in Lucien should give him the energy to win glory for\nhimself. This feminine Quixotry is a sentiment which hallows love and\nturns it to worthy uses; it exalts and reverences love. Mme. de\nBargeton having made up her mind to play the part of Dulcinea in\nLucien's life for seven or eight years to come, desired, like many\nother provincials, to give herself as the reward of prolonged service,\na trial of constancy which should give her time to judge her lover.\n\nLucien began the strife by a piece of vehement petulence, at which a\nwoman laughs so long as she is heart-free, and saddens only when she\nloves; whereupon Louise took a lofty tone, and began one of her long\norations, interlarded with high-sounding words.\n\n\"Was that your promise to me, Lucien?\" she said, as she made an end.\n\"Do not sow regrets in the present time, so sweet as it is, to poison\nmy after life. Do not spoil the future, and, I say it with pride, do\nnot spoil the present! Is not my whole heart yours? What more must you\nhave? Can it be that your love is influenced by the clamor of the\nsenses, when it is the noblest privilege of the beloved to silence\nthem? For whom do you take me? Am I not your Beatrice? If I am not\nsomething more than a woman for you, I am less than a woman.\"\n\n\"That is just what you might say to a man if you cared nothing at all\nfor him,\" cried Lucien, frantic with passion.\n\n\"If you cannot feel all the sincere love underlying my ideas, you will\nnever be worthy of me.\"\n\n\"You are throwing doubts on my love to dispense yourself from\nresponding to it,\" cried Lucien, and he flung himself weeping at her\nfeet.\n\nThe poor boy cried in earnest at the prospect of remaining so long at\nthe gate of paradise. The tears of the poet, who feels that he is\nhumbled through his strength, were mingled with childish crying for a\nplaything.\n\n\"You have never loved me!\" he cried.\n\n\"You do not believe what you say,\" she answered, flattered by his\nviolence.\n\n\"Then give me proof that you are mine,\" said the disheveled poet.\n\nJust at that moment Stanislas came up unheard by either of the pair.\nHe beheld Lucien in tears, half reclining on the floor, with his head\non Louise's knee. The attitude was suspicious enough to satisfy\nStanislas; he turned sharply round upon Chatelet, who stood at the\ndoor of the salon. Mme. de Bargeton sprang up in a moment, but the\nspies beat a precipate retreat like intruders, and she was not quick\nenough for them.\n\n\"Who came just now?\" she asked the servants.\n\n\"M. de Chandour and M. du Chatelet,\" said Gentil, her old footman.\n\nMme. de Bargeton went back, pale and trembling, to her boudoir.\n\n\"If they saw you just now, I am lost,\" she told Lucien.\n\n\"So much the better!\" exclaimed the poet, and she smiled to hear the\ncry, so full of selfish love.\n\nA story of this kind is aggravated in the provinces by the way in\nwhich it is told. Everybody knew in a moment that Lucien had been\ndetected at Nais feet. M. de Chandour, elated by the important part he\nplayed in the affair, went first to tell the great news at the club,\nand thence from house to house, Chatelet hastening to say that _he_ had\nseen nothing; but by putting himself out of court, he egged Stanislas\non to talk, he drew him on to add fresh details; and Stanislas,\nthinking himself very witty, added a little to the tale every time\nthat he told it. Every one flocked to Amelie's house that evening, for\nby that time the most exaggerated versions of the story were in\ncirculation among the Angouleme nobility, every narrator having\nfollowed Stanislas' example. Women and men were alike impatient to\nknow the truth; and the women who put their hands before their faces\nand shrieked the loudest were none other than Mesdames Amelie,\nZephirine, Fifine, and Lolotte, all with more or less heavy\nindictments of illicit love laid to their charge. There were\nvariations in every key upon the painful theme.\n\n\"Well, well,\" said one of the ladies, \"poor Nais! have you heard about\nit? I do not believe it myself; she has a whole blameless record\nbehind her; she is far too proud to be anything but a patroness to M.\nChardon. Still, if it is true, I pity her with all my heart.\"\n\n\"She is all the more to be pitied because she is making herself\nfrightfully ridiculous; she is old enough to be M. Lulu's mother, as\nJacques called him. The little poet it twenty-two at most; and Nais,\nbetween ourselves, is quite forty.\"\n\n\"For my own part,\" said M. du Chatelet, \"I think that M. de Rubempre's\nposition in itself proves Nais' innocence. A man does not go down on\nhis knees to ask for what he has had already.\"\n\n\"That is as may be!\" said Francis, with levity that brought\nZephirine's disapproving glance down on him.\n\n\"Do just tell us how it really was,\" they besought Stanislas, and\nformed a small, secret committee in a corner of the salon.\n\nStanislas, in the long length, had put together a little story full of\nfacetious suggestions, and accompanied it with pantomime, which made\nthe thing prodigiously worse.\n\n\"It is incredible!\"\n\n\"At midday?\"\n\n\"Nais was the last person whom I should have suspected!\"\n\n\"What will she do now?\"\n\nThen followed more comments, and suppositions without end. Chatelet\ntook Mme. de Bargeton's part; but he defended her so ill, that he\nstirred the fire of gossip instead of putting it out.\n\nLili, disconsolate over the fall of the fairest angel in the\nAngoumoisin hierarchy, went, dissolved in tears, to carry the news to\nthe palace. When the delighted Chatelet was convinced that the whole\ntown was agog, he went off to Mme. de Bargeton's, where, alas! there\nwas but one game of whist that night, and diplomatically asked Nais\nfor a little talk in the boudoir. They sat down on the sofa, and\nChatelet began in an undertone--\n\n\"You know what Angouleme is talking about, of course?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Very well, I am too much your friend to leave you in ignorance. I am\nbound to put you in a position to silence slanders, invented, no\ndoubt, by Amelie, who has the overweening audacity to regard herself\nas your rival. I came to call on you this morning with that monkey of\na Stanislas; he was a few paces ahead of me, and he came so far\"\n(pointing to the door of the boudoir); \"he says that he _saw_ you and\nM. de Rubempre in such a position that he could not enter; he turned\nround upon me, quite bewildered as I was, and hurried me away before I\nhad time to think; we were out in Beaulieu before he told me why he\nhad beaten a retreat. If I had known, I would not have stirred out of\nthe house till I had cleared up the matter and exonerated you, but it\nwould have proved nothing to go back again then.\n\n\"Now, whether Stanislas' eyes deceived him, or whether he is right, _he\nmust have made a mistake_. Dear Nais, do not let that dolt trifle with\nyour life, your honor, your future; stop his mouth at once. You know\nmy position here. I have need of all these people, but still I am\nentirely yours. Dispose of a life that belongs to you. You have\nrejected my prayers, but my heart is always yours; I am ready to prove\nmy love for you at any time and in any way. Yes, I will watch over you\nlike a faithful servant, for no reward, but simply for the sake of the\npleasure that it is to me to do anything for you, even if you do not\nknow of it. This morning I have said everywhere that I was at the door\nof the salon, and had seen nothing. If you are asked to give the name\nof the person who told you about this gossip, pray make use of me. I\nshould be very proud to be your acknowledged champion; but, between\nourselves, M. de Bargeton is the proper person to ask Stanislas for an\nexplanation. . . . Suppose that young Rubempre had behaved foolishly,\na woman's character ought not to be at the mercy of the first\nhare-brained boy who flings himself at her feet. That is what I have\nbeen saying.\"\n\nNais bowed in acknowledgment, and looked thoughtful. She was weary to\ndisgust of provincial life. Chatelet had scarcely begun before her\nmind turned to Paris. Meanwhile Mme. de Bargeton's adorer found the\nsilence somewhat awkward.\n\n\"Dispose of me, I repeat,\" he added.\n\n\"Thank you,\" answered the lady.\n\n\"What do you think of doing?\"\n\n\"I shall see.\"\n\nA prolonged pause.\n\n\"Are you so fond of that young Rubempre?\"\n\nA proud smile stole over her lips, she folded her arms, and fixed her\ngaze on the curtains. Chatelet went out; he could not read that high\nheart.\n\nLater in the evening, when Lucien had taken his leave, and likewise\nthe four old gentlemen who came for their whist, without troubling\nthemselves about ill-founded tittle-tattle, M. de Bargeton was\npreparing to go to bed, and had opened his mouth to bid his wife\ngood-night, when she stopped him.\n\n\"Come here, dear, I have something to say to you,\" she said, with a\ncertain solemnity.\n\nM. de Bargeton followed her into the boudoir.\n\n\"Perhaps I have done wrongly,\" she said, \"to show a warm interest in\nM. de Rubempre, which he, as well as the stupid people here in the\ntown, has misinterpreted. This morning Lucien threw himself here at my\nfeet with a declaration, and Stanislas happened to come in just as I\ntold the boy to get up again. A woman, under any circumstances, has\nclaims which courtesy prescribes to a gentleman; but in contempt of\nthese, Stanislas has been saying that he came unexpectedly and found\nus in an equivocal position. I was treating the boy as he deserved. If\nthe young scatterbrain knew of the scandal caused by his folly, he\nwould go, I am convinced, to insult Stanislas, and compel him to\nfight. That would simply be a public proclamation of his love. I need\nnot tell you that your wife is pure; but if you think, you will see\nthat it is something dishonoring for both you and me if M. de Rubempre\ndefends her. Go at once to Stanislas and ask him to give you\nsatisfaction for his insulting language; and mind, you must not accept\nany explanation short of a full and public retraction in the presence\nof witnesses of credit. In this way you will win back the respect of\nall right-minded people; you will behave like a man of spirit and a\ngentleman, and you will have a right to my esteem. I shall send Gentil\non horseback to the Escarbas; my father must be your second; old as he\nis, I know that he is the man to trample this puppet under foot that\nhas smirched the reputation of a Negrepelisse. You have the choice of\nweapons, choose pistols; you are an admirable shot.\"\n\n\"I am going,\" said M. de Bargeton, and he took his hat and his walking\ncane.\n\n\"Good, that is how I like a man to behave, dear; you are a gentleman,\"\nsaid his wife. She felt touched by his conduct, and made the old man\nvery happy and proud by putting up her forehead for a kiss. She felt\nsomething like a maternal affection for the great child; and when the\ncarriage gateway had shut with a clang behind him, the tears came into\nher eyes in spite of herself.\n\n\"How he loves me!\" she thought. \"He clings to life, poor, dear man,\nand yet he would give his life for me.\"\n\nIt did not trouble M. de Bargeton that he must stand up and face his\nman on the morrow, and look coolly into the muzzle of a pistol pointed\nstraight at him; no, only one thing in the business made him feel\nuncomfortable, and on the way to M. de Chandour's house he quaked\ninwardly.\n\n\"What shall I say?\" he thought within himself; \"Nais really ought to\nhave told me what to say,\" and the good gentleman racked his brains to\ncompose a speech that should not be ridiculous.\n\nBut people of M. de Bargeton's stamp, who live perforce in silence\nbecause their capacity is limited and their outlook circumscribed,\noften behave at great crises with a ready-made solemnity. If they say\nlittle, it naturally follows that they say little that is foolish;\ntheir extreme lack of confidence leads them to think a good deal over\nthe remarks that they are obliged to make; and, like Balaam's ass,\nthey speak marvelously to the point if a miracle loosens their\ntongues. So M. de Bargeton bore himself like a man of uncommon sense\nand spirit, and justified the opinion of those who held that he was a\nphilosopher of the school of Pythagoras.\n\nHe reached Stanislas' house at nine o'clock, bowed silently to Amelie\nbefore a whole room full of people, and greeted others in turn with\nthat simple smile of his, which under the present circumstances seemed\nprofoundly ironical. There followed a great silence, like the pause\nbefore a storm. Chatelet had made his way back again, and now looked\nin a very significant fashion from M. de Bargeton to Stanislas, whom\nthe injured gentleman accosted politely.\n\nChatelet knew what a visit meant at this time of night, when old M. de\nBargeton was invariably in his bed. It was evidently Nais who had set\nthe feeble arm in motion. Chatelet was on such a footing in that house\nthat he had some right to interfere in family concerns. He rose to his\nfeet and took M. de Bargeton aside, saying, \"Do you wish to speak to\nStanislas?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said the old gentleman, well pleased to find a go-between who\nperhaps might say his say for him.\n\n\"Very well; go into Amelie's bedroom,\" said the controller of excise,\nlikewise well pleased at the prospect of a duel which possibly might\nmake Mme. de Bargeton a widow, while it put a bar between her and\nLucien, the cause of the quarrel. Then Chatelet went to M. de\nChandour.\n\n\"Stanislas,\" he said, \"here comes Bargeton to call you to account, no\ndoubt, for the things you have been saying about Nais. Go into your\nwife's room, and behave, both of you, like gentlemen. Keep the thing\nquiet, and make a great show of politeness, behave with phlegmatic\nBritish dignity, in short.\"\n\nIn another minute Stanislas and Chatelet went to Bargeton.\n\n\"Sir,\" said the injured husband, \"do you say that you discovered Mme.\nde Bargeton and M. de Rubempre in an equivocal position?\"\n\n\"M. Chardon,\" corrected Stanislas, with ironical stress; he did not\ntake Bargeton seriously.\n\n\"So be it,\" answered the other. \"If you do not withdraw your\nassertions at once before the company now in your house, I must ask\nyou to look for a second. My father-in-law, M. de Negrepelisse, will\nwait upon you at four o'clock to-morrow morning. Both of us may as\nwell make our final arrangements, for the only way out of the affair\nis the one that I have indicated. I choose pistols, as the insulted\nparty.\"\n\nThis was the speech that M. de Bargeton had ruminated on the way; it\nwas the longest that he had ever made in life. He brought it out\nwithout excitement or vehemence, in the simplest way in the world.\nStanislas turned pale. \"After all, what did I see?\" said he to\nhimself.\n\nPut between the shame of eating his words before the whole town, and\nfear, that caught him by the throat with burning fingers; confronted\nby this mute personage, who seemed in no humor to stand nonsense,\nStanislas chose the more remote peril.\n\n\"All right. To-morrow morning,\" he said, thinking that the matter\nmight be arranged somehow or other.\n\nThe three went back to the room. Everybody scanned their faces as they\ncame in; Chatelet was smiling, M. de Bargeton looked exactly as if he\nwere in his own house, but Stanislas looked ghastly pale. At the sight\nof his face, some of the women here and there guessed the nature of\nthe conference, and the whisper, \"They are going to fight!\" circulated\nfrom ear to ear. One-half of the room was of the opinion that\nStanislas was in the wrong, his white face and his demeanor convicted\nhim of a lie; the other half admired M. de Bargeton's attitude.\nChatelet was solemn and mysterious. M. de Bargeton stayed a few\nminutes, scrutinized people's faces, and retired.\n\n\"Have you pistols?\" Chatelet asked in a whisper of Stanislas, who\nshook from head to foot.\n\nAmelie knew what it all meant. She felt ill, and the women flocked\nabout her to take her into her bedroom. There was a terrific\nsensation; everybody talked at once. The men stopped in the\ndrawing-room, and declared, with one voice, that M. de Bargeton was\nwithin his right.\n\n\"Would you have thought the old fogy capable of acting like this?\"\nasked M. de Saintot.\n\n\"But he was a crack shot when he was young,\" said the pitiless\nJacques. \"My father often used to tell me of Bargeton's exploits.\"\n\n\"Pooh! Put them at twenty paces, and they will miss each other if you\ngive them cavalry pistols,\" said Francis, addressing Chatelet.\n\nChatelet stayed after the rest had gone to reassure Stanislas and his\nwife, and to explain that all would go off well. In a duel between a\nman of sixty and a man of thirty-five, all the advantage lay with the\nlatter.\n\nEarly next morning, as Lucien sat at breakfast with David, who had\ncome back alone from Marsac, in came Mme. Chardon with a scared face.\n\n\"Well, Lucien,\" she said, \"have you heard the news? Everyone is\ntalking of it, even the people in the market. M. de Bargeton all but\nkilled M. de Chandour this morning in M. Tulloy's meadow; people are\nmaking puns on the name. (Tue Poie.) It seems that M. de Chandour said\nthat he found you with Mme. de Bargeton yesterday.\"\n\n\"It is a lie! Mme. de Bargeton is innocent,\" cried Lucien.\n\n\"I heard about the duel from a countryman, who saw it all from his\ncart. M. de Negrepelisse came over at three o'clock in the morning to\nbe M. de Bargeton's second; he told M. de Chandour that if anything\nhappened to his son-in-law, he should avenge him. A cavalry officer\nlent the pistols. M. de Negrepelisse tried them over and over again.\nM. du Chatelet tried to prevent them from practising with the pistols,\nbut they referred the question to the officer; and he said that,\nunless they meant to behave like children, they ought to have pistols\nin working order. The seconds put them at twenty-five paces. M. de\nBargeton looked as if he had just come out for a walk. He was the\nfirst to fire; the ball lodged in M. de Chandour's neck, and he\ndropped before he could return the shot. The house-surgeon at the\nhospital has just said that M. de Chandour will have a wry neck for\nthe rest of his days. I came to tell you how it ended, lest you should\ngo to Mme. de Bargeton's or show yourself in Angouleme, for some of M.\nde Chandour's friends might call you out.\"\n\nAs she spoke, the apprentice brought in Gentil, M. de Bargeton's\nfootman. The man had come with a note for Lucien; it was from Louise.\n\n\"You have doubtless heard the news,\" she wrote, \"of the duel between\nChandour and my husband. We shall not be at home to any one to-day. Be\ncareful; do not show yourself. I ask this in the name of the affection\nyou bear me. Do you not think that it would be best to spend this\nmelancholy day in listening to your Beatrice, whose whole life has\nbeen changed by this event, who has a thousand things to say to you?\"\n\n\"Luckily, my marriage is fixed for the day after to-morrow,\" said\nDavid, \"and you will have an excuse for not going to see Mme. de\nBargeton quite so often.\"\n\n\"Dear David,\" returned Lucien, \"she asks me to go to her to-day; and I\nought to do as she wishes, I think; she knows better than we do how I\nshould act in the present state of things.\"\n\n\"Then is everything ready here?\" asked Mme. Chardon.\n\n\"Come and see,\" cried David, delighted to exhibit the transformation\nof the first floor. Everything there was new and fresh; everything was\npervaded by the sweet influences of early married days, still crowned\nby the wreath of orange blossoms and the bridal veil; days when the\nspringtide of love finds its reflection in material things, and\neverything is white and spotless and has not lost its bloom.\n\n\"Eve's home will be fit for a princess,\" said the mother, \"but you\nhave spent too much, you have been reckless.\"\n\nDavid smiled by way of answer. But Mme. Chardon had touched the sore\nspot in a hidden wound which caused the poor lover cruel pangs. The\ncost of carrying out his ideas had far exceeded his estimates; he\ncould not afford to build above the shed. His mother-in-law must wait\nawhile for the home he had meant to make for her. There is nothing\nmore keenly painful to a generous nature than a failure to keep such\npromises as these; it is like mortification to the little vanities of\naffection, as they may be styled. David sedulously hid his\nembarrassment to spare Lucien; he was afraid that Lucien might be\noverwhelmed by the sacrifices made for his sake.\n\n\"Eve and her girl friends have been working very hard, too,\" said Mme.\nChardon. \"The wedding clothes and the house linen are all ready. The\ngirls are so fond of her, that, without letting her know about it,\nthey have covered the mattresses with white twill and a rose-colored\npiping at the edges. So pretty! It makes one wish one were going to be\nmarried.\"\n\nMother and daughter had spent all their little savings to furnish\nDavid's home with the things of which a young bachelor never thinks.\nThey knew that he was furnishing with great splendor, for something\nhad been said about ordering a dinner-service from Limoges, and the\ntwo women had striven to make Eve's contributions to the housekeeping\nworthy of David's. This little emulation in love and generosity could\nbut bring the husband and wife into difficulties at the very outset of\ntheir married life, with every sign of homely comfort about them,\ncomfort that might be regarded as positive luxury in a place so behind\nthe times as the Angouleme of those days.\n\nAs soon as Lucien saw his mother and David enter the bedroom with the\nblue-and-white draperies and neat furniture that he knew, he slipped\naway to Mme. de Bargeton. He found Nais at table with her husband; M.\nde Bargeton's early morning walk had sharpened his appetite, and he\nwas breakfasting quite unconcernedly after all that had passed. Lucien\nsaw the dignified face of M. de Negrepelisse, the old provincial\nnoble, a relic of the old French _noblesse_, sitting beside Nais.\n\nWhen Gentil announced M. de Rubempre, the white-headed old man gave\nhim a keen, curious glance; the father was anxious to form his own\nopinions of this man whom his daughter had singled out for notice.\nLucien's extreme beauty made such a vivid impression upon him, that he\ncould not repress an approving glance; but at the same time he seemed\nto regard the affair as a flirtation, a mere passing fancy on his\ndaughter's part. Breakfast over, Louise could leave her father and M.\nde Bargeton together; she beckoned Lucien to follow her as she\nwithdrew.\n\n\"Dear,\" she said, and the tones of her voice were half glad, half\nmelancholy, \"I am going to Paris, and my father is taking Bargeton\nback with him to the Escarbas, where he will stay during my absence.\nMme. d'Espard (she was a Blamont-Chauvry before her marriage) has\ngreat influence herself, and influential relations. The d'Espards are\nconnections of ours; they are the older branch of the Negrepelisses;\nand if she vouchsafes to acknowledge the relationship, I intend to\ncultivate her a good deal; she may perhaps procure a place for\nBargeton. At my solicitation, it might be desired at Court that he\nshould represent the Charente, and that would be a step towards his\nelection here. If he were a deputy, it would further other steps that\nI wish to take in Paris. You, my darling, have brought about this\nchange in my life. After this morning's duel, I am obliged to shut up\nmy house for some time; for there will be people who will side with\nthe Chandours against us. In our position, and in a small town,\nabsence is the only way of softening down bad feeling. But I shall\neither succeed, and never see Angouleme again, or I shall not succeed,\nand then I mean to wait in Paris until the time comes when I can spend\nmy summers at the Escarbas and the winters in Paris. It is the only\nlife for a woman of quality, and I have waited too long before\nentering upon it. The one day will be enough for our preparations;\nto-morrow night I shall set out, and you are coming with me, are you\nnot? You shall start first. I will overtake you between Mansle and\nRuffec, and we shall soon be in Paris. There, beloved, is the life for\na man who has anything in him. We are only at our ease among our\nequals; we are uncomfortable in any other society. Paris, besides, is\nthe capital of the intellectual world, the stage on which you will\nsucceed; overleap the gulf that separates us quickly. You must not\nallow your ideas to grow rancid in the provinces; put yourself into\ncommunication at once with the great men who represent the nineteenth\ncentury. Try to stand well with the Court and with those in power. No\nhonor, no distinction, comes to seek out the talent that perishes for\nlack of light in a little town; tell me, if you can, the name of any\ngreat work of art executed in the provinces! On the contrary, see how\nJean-Jacques, himself sublime in his poverty, felt the irresistible\nattraction of that sun of the intellectual world, which produces\never-new glories and stimulates the intellect--Paris, where men rub\nagainst one another. What is it but your duty to hasten to take your\nplace in the succession of pleiades that rise from generation to\ngeneration? You have no idea how it contributes to the success of a\nclever young man to be brought into a high light, socially speaking.\nI will introduce you to Mme. d'Espard; it is not easy to get into her\nset; but you meet all the greatest people at her house, Cabinet\nministers and ambassadors, and great orators from the Chamber of\nDeputies, and peers and men of influence, and wealthy or famous people.\nA young man with good looks and more than sufficient genius could fail\nto excite interest only by very bad management.\n\n\"There is no pettiness about those who are truly great; they will lend\nyou their support; and when you yourself have a high position, your\nwork will rise immensely in public opinion. The great problem for the\nartist is the problem of putting himself in evidence. In these ways\nthere will be hundreds of chances of making your way, of sinecures, of\na pension from the civil list. The Bourbons are so fond of encouraging\nletters and the arts, and you therefore must be a religious poet and a\nRoyalist poet at the same time. Not only is it the right course, but\nit is the way to get on in life. Do the Liberals and the Opposition\ngive places and rewards, and make the fortunes of men of letters? Take\nthe right road and reach the goal of genius. You have my secret, do\nnot breathe a syllable of it, and prepare to follow me.--Would you\nrather not go?\" she added, surprised that her lover made no answer.\n\nTo Lucien, listening to the alluring words, and bewildered by the\nrapid bird's-eye view of Paris which they brought before him, it\nseemed as if hitherto he had been using only half his brain and\nsuddenly had found the other half, so swiftly his ideas widened. He\nsaw himself stagnating in Angouleme like a frog under a stone in a\nmarsh. Paris and her splendors rose before him; Paris, the Eldorado of\nprovincial imaginings, with golden robes and the royal diadem about\nher brows, and arms outstretched to talent of every kind. Great men\nwould greet him there as one of their order. Everything smiled upon\ngenius. There, there were no jealous booby-squires to invent stinging\ngibes and humiliate a man of letters; there was no stupid indifference\nto poetry in Paris. Paris was the fountain-head of poetry; there the\npoet was brought into the light and paid for his work. Publishers\nshould no sooner read the opening pages of _An Archer of Charles IX._\nthan they should open their cash-boxes with \"How much do you want?\"\nAnd besides all this, he understood that this journey with Mme. de\nBargeton would virtually give her to him; that they should live\ntogether.\n\nSo at the words, \"Would you rather not go?\" tears came into his eyes,\nhe flung his arms about Louise, held her tightly to his heart, and\nmarbled her throat with impassioned kisses. Suddenly he checked\nhimself, as if memory had dealt him a blow.\n\n\"Great heavens!\" he cried, \"my sister is to be married on the day\nafter to-morrow!\"\n\n\n\nThat exclamation was the last expiring cry of noble and single-hearted\nboyhood. The so-powerful ties that bind young hearts to home, and a\nfirst friendship, and all early affections, were to be severed at one\nruthless blow.\n\n\"Well,\" cried the haughty Negrepelisse, \"and what has your sister's\nmarriage to do with the progress of our love? Have you set your mind\nso much on being best man at a wedding party of tradespeople and\nworkingmen, that you cannot give up these exalted joys for my sake? A\ngreat sacrifice, indeed!\" she went on, scornfully. \"This morning I\nsent my husband out to fight in your quarrel. There, sir, go; I am\nmistaken in you.\"\n\nShe sank fainting upon the sofa. Lucien went to her, entreating her\npardon, calling execrations upon his family, his sister, and David.\n\n\"I had such faith in you!\" she said. \"M. de Cante-Croix had an adored\nmother; but to win a letter from me, and the words, 'I am satisfied,'\nhe fell in the thick of the fight. And now, when I ask you to take a\njourney with me, you cannot think of giving up a wedding dinner for my\nsake.\"\n\nLucien was ready to kill himself; his desperation was so unfeigned,\nthat Louise forgave him, though at the same time she made him feel\nthat he must redeem his mistake.\n\n\"Come, come,\" she said, \"be discreet, and to-morrow at midnight be\nupon the road, a hundred paces out of Mansle.\"\n\nLucien felt the globe shrink under his feet; he went back to David's\nhouse, hopes pursuing him as the Furies followed Orestes, for he had\nglimmerings of endless difficulties, all summed up in the appalling\nwords, \"Where is the money to come from?\"\n\nHe stood in such terror of David's perspicacity, that he locked\nhimself into his pretty new study until he could recover himself, his\nhead was swimming in this new position. So he must leave the rooms\njust furnished for him at such a cost, and all the sacrifices that had\nbeen made for him had been made in vain. Then it occurred to Lucien\nthat his mother might take the rooms and save David the heavy expense\nof building at the end of the yard, as he had meant to do; his\ndeparture would be, in fact, a convenience to the family. He\ndiscovered any quantity of urgent reasons for his sudden flight; for\nthere is no such Jesuit as the desire of your heart. He hurried down\nat once to tell the news to his sister in L'Houmeau and to take\ncounsel with her. As he reached Postel's shop, he bethought himself\nthat if all other means failed, he could borrow enough to live upon\nfor a year from his father's successor.\n\n\"Three francs per day will be abundance for me if I live with Louise,\"\nhe thought; \"it is only a thousand francs for a whole year. And in six\nmonths' time I shall have plenty of money.\"\n\nThen, under seal and promise of secrecy, Eve and her mother heard\nLucien's confidences. Both the women began to cry as they heard of the\nambitious plans; and when he asked the reason of their trouble, they\ntold him that every penny they possessed had been spent on\ntable-linen, house-linen, Eve's wedding clothes, and on a host of\nthings that David had overlooked. They had been so glad to do this, for\nDavid had made a marriage-settlement of ten thousand francs on Eve.\nLucien then spoke of his idea of a loan, and Mme. Chardon undertook to\nask M. Postel to lend them a thousand francs for a twelve-month.\n\n\"But, Lucien,\" said Eve, as a thought clutched at her heart, \"you will\nnot be here at my wedding! Oh! come back, I will put it off for a few\ndays. Surely she will give you leave to come back in a fortnight, if\nonly you go with her now? Surely, she would spare you to us for a\nweek, Lucien, when we brought you up for her? We shall have no luck if\nyou are not at the wedding. . . . But will a thousand francs be enough\nfor you?\" she asked, suddenly interrupting herself. \"Your coat suits\nyou divinely, but you have only that one! You have only two fine\nshirts, the other six are coarse linen; and three of your white ties\nare just common muslin, there are only two lawn cravats, and your\npocket-handkerchiefs are not good ones. Where will you find a sister\nin Paris who will get up your linen in one day as you want it? You\nwill want ever so much more. Then you have just the one pair of new\nnankeen trousers, last year's trousers are tight for you; you will be\nobliged to have clothes made in Paris, and Paris prices are not like\nAngouleme prices. You have only two presentable white waistcoats; I\nhave mended the others already. Come, I advise you to take two\nthousand francs.\"\n\nDavid came in as she spoke, and apparently heard the last two words,\nfor he looked at the brother and sister and said nothing.\n\n\"Do not keep anything from me,\" he said at last.\n\n\"Well,\" exclaimed Eve, \"he is going away with _her_.\"\n\nMme. Chardon came in again, and, not seeing David, began at once:\n\n\"Postel is willing to lend you the thousand francs, Lucien,\" she said,\n\"but only for six months; and even then he wants you to let him have a\nbill endorsed by your brother-in-law, for he says that you are giving\nhim no security.\"\n\nShe turned and saw David, and there was a deep silence in the room.\nThe Chardons thought how they had abused David's goodness, and felt\nashamed. Tears stood in the young printer's eyes.\n\n\"Then you will not be here at our wedding,\" he began. \"You are not\ngoing to live with us! And here have I been squandering all that I\nhad! Oh! Lucien, as I came along, bringing Eve her little bits of\nwedding jewelry, I did not think that I should be sorry I spent the\nmoney on them.\" He brushed his hand over his eyes as he drew the\nlittle cases from his pocket.\n\nHe set down the tiny morocco-covered boxes on the table in front of\nhis mother-in-law.\n\n\"Oh! why do you think so much for me?\" protested Eve, giving him a\ndivinely sweet smile that belied her words.\n\n\"Mamma, dear,\" said David, \"just tell M. Postel that I will put my\nname to the bill, for I can tell from your face, Lucien, that you have\nquite made up your mind to go.\"\n\nLucien's head sank dejectedly; there was a little pause, then he said,\n\"Do not think hardly of me, my dear, good angels.\"\n\nHe put his arms about Eve and David, and drew them close, and held\nthem tightly to him as he added, \"Wait and see what comes of it, and\nyou shall know how much I love you. What is the good of our high\nthinking, David, if it does not enable us to disregard the petty\nceremonial in which the law entangles our affections? Shall I not be\nwith you in spirit, in spite of the distance between us? Shall we not\nbe united in thought? Have I not a destiny to fulfil? Will publishers\ncome here to seek my _Archer of Charles IX._ and the _Marguerites_? A\nlittle sooner or a little later I shall be obliged in any case to do\nas I am doing to-day, should I not? And shall I ever find a better\nopportunity than this? Does not my success entirely depend upon my\nentrance on life in Paris through the Marquise d'Espard's salon?\"\n\n\"He is right,\" said Eve; \"you yourself were saying, were you not, that\nhe ought to go to Paris at once?\"\n\nDavid took Eve's hand in his, and drew her into the narrow little room\nwhere she had slept for seven years.\n\n\"Love, you were saying just now that he would want two thousand\nfrancs?\" he said in her ear. \"Postel is only lending one thousand.\"\n\nEve gave her betrothed a look, and he read all her anguish in her\neyes.\n\n\"Listen, my adored Eve, we are making a bad start in life. Yes, my\nexpenses have taken all my capital; I have just two thousand francs\nleft, and half of it will be wanted to carry on the business. If we\ngive your brother the thousand francs, it will mean that we are giving\naway our bread, that we shall live in anxiety. If I were alone, I know\nwhat I should do; but we are two. Decide for us.\"\n\nEve, distracted, sprang to her lover's arms, and kissed him tenderly,\nas she answered through her tears:\n\n\"Do as you would do if you were alone; I will work to earn the money.\"\n\nIn spite of the most impassioned kiss ever given and taken by\nbetrothed lovers, David left Eve overcome with trouble, and went out\nto Lucien.\n\n\"Do not worry yourself,\" he said; \"you shall have your two thousand\nfrancs.\"\n\n\"Go in to see Postel,\" said Mme. Chardon, \"for you must both give your\nsignatures to the bill.\"\n\nWhen Lucien and David came back again unexpectedly, they found Eve and\nher mother on their knees in prayer. The women felt sure that Lucien's\nreturn would bring the realization of many hopes; but at the moment\nthey could only feel how much they were losing in the parting, and the\nhappiness to come seemed too dearly bought by an absence that broke up\ntheir life together, and would fill the coming days with innumerable\nfears for Lucien.\n\n\"If you could ever forget this sight,\" David said in Lucien's ear,\n\"you would be the basest of men.\"\n\nDavid, no doubt, thought that these brave words were needed; Mme. de\nBargeton's influence seemed to him less to be feared than his friend's\nunlucky instability of character, Lucien was so easily led for good or\nevil. Eve soon packed Lucien's clothes; the Fernando Cortez of\nliterature carried but little baggage. He was wearing his best\novercoat, his best waistcoat, and one of the two fine shirts. The\nwhole of his linen, the celebrated coat, and his manuscript made up so\nsmall a package that to hide it from Mme. de Bargeton, David proposed\nto send it by coach to a paper merchant with whom he had dealings, and\nwrote and advised him to that effect, and asked him to keep the parcel\nuntil Lucien sent for it.\n\nIn spite of Mme. de Bargeton's precautions, Chatelet found out that\nshe was leaving Angouleme; and with a view to discovering whether she\nwas traveling alone or with Lucien, he sent his man to Ruffec with\ninstructions to watch every carriage that changed horses at that\nstage.\n\n\"If she is taking her poet with her,\" thought he, \"I have her now.\"\n\nLucien set out before daybreak the next morning. David went with him.\nDavid had hired a cabriolet, pretending that he was going to Marsac on\nbusiness, a little piece of deception which seemed probable under the\ncircumstances. The two friends went to Marsac, and spent part of the\nday with the old \"bear.\" As evening came on they set out again, and in\nthe beginning of the dawn they waited in the road, on the further side\nof Mansle, for Mme. de Bargeton. When the seventy-year old traveling\ncarriage, which he had many a time seen in the coach-house, appeared\nin sight, Lucien felt more deeply moved than he had ever been in his\nlife before; he sprang into David's arms.\n\n\"God grant that this may be for your good!\" said David, and he climbed\ninto the shabby cabriolet and drove away with a feeling of dread\nclutching at his heart; he had terrible presentiments of the fate\nawaiting Lucien in Paris.\n\n\n\n\nADDENDUM\n\nThe following personages appear in other stories of the Human Comedy.\n\nBargeton, Madame de (see Chatelet, Baronne du)\n\nCerizet\n  Eve and David\n  A Man of Business\n  Scenes from a Courtesan's Life\n  The Middle Classes\n\nChardon, Madame (nee Rubempre)\n  Eve and David\n  Scenes from a Courtesan's Life\n\nChatelet, Sixte, Baron du\n  A Distinguished Provincial at Paris\n  Scenes from a Courtesan's Life\n  The Thirteen\n\nChatelet, Marie-Louise-Anais de Negrepelisse, Baronne du\n  A Distinguished Provincial at Paris\n  The Government Clerks\n\nCointet, Boniface\n  Eve and David\n  The Firm of Nucingen\n  The Member for Arcis\n\nCointet, Jean\n  Eve and David\n\nCourtois\n  Eve and David\n\nCourtois, Madame\n  Eve and David\n\nDesplein\n  The Atheist's Mass\n  Cousin Pons\n  The Thirteen\n  The Government Clerks\n  Pierrette\n  A Bachelor's Establishment\n  The Seamy Side of History\n  Modeste Mignon\n  Scenes from a Courtesan's Life\n  Honorine\n\nGentil\n  A Distinguished Provincial at Paris\n\nGrozier, Abbe\n  The Commission in Lunacy\n\nHautoy, Francis du\n  Eve and David\n\nMaucombe, Comte de\n\n  Letters of Two Brides\n\nMontriveau, General Marquis Armand de\n  The Thirteen\n  Father Goriot\n  A Distinguished Provincial at Paris\n  Another Study of Woman\n  Pierrette\n  The Member for Arcis\n\nNegrepelisse, De\n  The Commission in Lunacy\n  A Distinguished Provincial at Paris\n\nPetit-Claud\n  Eve and David\n\nPimentel, Marquis and Marquise de\n  Eve and David\n\nPostel\n  Eve and David\n\nPrieur, Madame\n  Eve and David\n\nRastignac, Baron and Baronne de (Eugene's parents)\n  Father Goriot\n\nRastignac, Laure-Rose and Agathe de\n  Father Goriot\n  The Member for Arcis\n\nRubempre, Lucien-Chardon de\n  Eve and David\n  A Distinguished Provincial at Paris\n  The Government Clerks\n  Ursule Mirouet\n  Scenes from a Courtesan's Life\n\nSechard, Jerome-Nicolas\n  Eve and David\n\nSechard, David\n  Eve and David\n  A Distinguished Provincial At Paris\n  Scenes from a Courtesan's Life\n\nSechard, Madame David\n  Eve and David\n  A Distinguished Provincial At Paris\n  Scenes from a Courtesan's Life\n\nSenonches, Jacques de\n  Eve and David\n\nSenonches, Madame Jacques de\n  Eve and David\n\nStanhope, Lady Esther\n  The Lily of the Valley\n\n\n\n                                  II\n\n\n\n                 A DISTINGUISHED PROVINCIAL AT PARIS\n                       (Lost Illusions Part II)\n\n                                  BY\n\n                           HONORE DE BALZAC\n\n\n\n                            Translated By\n                            Ellen Marriage\n\n\n\n                                PART I\n\nMme. de Bargeton and Lucien de Rubempre had left Angouleme behind, and\nwere traveling together upon the road to Paris. Not one of the party\nwho made that journey alluded to it afterwards; but it may be believed\nthat an infatuated youth who had looked forward to the delights of an\nelopement, must have found the continual presence of Gentil, the\nman-servant, and Albertine, the maid, not a little irksome on the way.\nLucien, traveling post for the first time in his life, was horrified\nto see pretty nearly the whole sum on which he meant to live in Paris\nfor a twelvemonth dropped along the road. Like other men who combine\ngreat intellectual powers with the charming simplicity of childhood,\nhe openly expressed his surprise at the new and wonderful things which\nhe saw, and thereby made a mistake. A man should study a woman very\ncarefully before he allows her to see his thoughts and emotions as\nthey arise in him. A woman, whose nature is large as her heart is\ntender, can smile upon childishness, and make allowances; but let her\nhave ever so small a spice of vanity herself, and she cannot forgive\nchildishness, or littleness, or vanity in her lover. Many a woman is\nso extravagant a worshiper that she must always see the god in her\nidol; but there are yet others who love a man for his sake and not for\ntheir own, and adore his failings with his greater qualities.\n\nLucien had not guessed as yet that Mme. de Bargeton's love was grafted\non pride. He made another mistake when he failed to discern the\nmeaning of certain smiles which flitted over Louise's lips from time\nto time; and instead of keeping himself to himself, he indulged in the\nplayfulness of the young rat emerging from his hole for the first\ntime.\n\nThe travelers were set down before daybreak at the sign of the\nGaillard-Bois in the Rue de l'Echelle, both so tired out with the\njourney that Louise went straight to bed and slept, first bidding\nLucien to engage the room immediately overhead. Lucien slept on till\nfour o'clock in the afternoon, when he was awakened by Mme. de\nBargeton's servant, and learning the hour, made a hasty toilet and\nhurried downstairs.\n\nLouise was sitting in the shabby inn sitting-room. Hotel accommodation\nis a blot on the civilization of Paris; for with all its pretensions\nto elegance, the city as yet does not boast a single inn where a\nwell-to-do traveler can find the surroundings to which he is accustomed\nat home. To Lucien's just-awakened, sleep-dimmed eyes, Louise was\nhardly recognizable in this cheerless, sunless room, with the shabby\nwindow-curtains, the comfortless polished floor, the hideous furniture\nbought second-hand, or much the worse for wear.\n\nSome people no longer look the same when detached from the background\nof faces, objects, and surroundings which serve as a setting, without\nwhich, indeed, they seem to lose something of their intrinsic worth.\nPersonality demands its appropriate atmosphere to bring out its\nvalues, just as the figures in Flemish interiors need the arrangement\nof light and shade in which they are placed by the painter's genius if\nthey are to live for us. This is especially true of provincials. Mme.\nde Bargeton, moreover, looked more thoughtful and dignified than was\nnecessary now, when no barriers stood between her and happiness.\n\nGentil and Albertine waited upon them, and while they were present\nLucien could not complain. The dinner, sent in from a neighboring\nrestaurant, fell far below the provincial average, both in quantity\nand quality; the essential goodness of country fare was wanting, and\nin point of quantity the portions were cut with so strict an eye to\nbusiness that they savored of short commons. In such small matters\nParis does not show its best side to travelers of moderate fortune.\nLucien waited till the meal was over. Some change had come over\nLouise, he thought, but he could not explain it.\n\nAnd a change had, in fact, taken place. Events had occurred while he\nslept; for reflection is an event in our inner history, and Mme. de\nBargeton had been reflecting.\n\nAbout two o'clock that afternoon, Sixte du Chatelet made his\nappearance in the Rue de l'Echelle and asked for Albertine. The\nsleeping damsel was roused, and to her he expressed his wish to speak\nwith her mistress. Mme. de Bargeton had scarcely time to dress before\nhe came back again. The unaccountable apparition of M. du Chatelet\nroused the lady's curiosity, for she had kept her journey a profound\nsecret, as she thought. At three o'clock the visitor was admitted.\n\n\"I have risked a reprimand from headquarters to follow you,\" he said,\nas he greeted her; \"I foresaw coming events. But if I lose my post for\nit, YOU, at any rate, shall not be lost.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" exclaimed Mme. de Bargeton.\n\n\"I can see plainly that you love Lucien,\" he continued, with an air of\ntender resignation. \"You must love indeed if _you_ can act thus\nrecklessly, and disregard the conventions which you know so well. Dear\nadored Nais, can you really imagine that Mme. d'Espard's salon, or any\nother salon in Paris, will not be closed to you as soon as it is known\nthat you have fled from Angouleme, as it were, with a young man,\nespecially after the duel between M. de Bargeton and M. de Chandour?\nThe fact that your husband has gone to the Escarbas looks like a\nseparation. Under such circumstances a gentleman fights first and\nafterwards leaves his wife at liberty. By all means, give M. de\nRubempre your love and your countenance; do just as you please; but\nyou must not live in the same house. If anybody here in Paris knew\nthat you had traveled together, the whole world that you have a mind\nto see would point the finger at you.\n\n\"And, Nais, do not make these sacrifices for a young man whom you have\nas yet compared with no one else; he, on his side, has been put to no\nproof; he may forsake you for some Parisienne, better able, as he may\nfancy, to further his ambitions. I mean no harm to the man you love,\nbut you will permit me to put your own interests before his, and to\nbeg you to study him, to be fully aware of the serious nature of this\nstep that you are taking. And, then, if you find all doors closed\nagainst you, and that none of the women call upon you, make sure at\nleast that you will feel no regret for all that you have renounced for\nhim. Be very certain first that he for whom you will have given up so\nmuch will always be worthy of your sacrifices and appreciate them.\n\n\"Just now,\" continued Chatelet, \"Mme. d'Espard is the more prudish and\nparticular because she herself is separated from her husband, nobody\nknows why. The Navarreins, the Lenoncourts, the Blamont-Chauvrys, and\nthe rest of the relations have all rallied round her; the most\nstrait-laced women are seen at her house, and receive her with respect,\nand the Marquis d'Espard has been put in the wrong. The first call that\nyou pay will make it clear to you that I am right; indeed, knowing\nParis as I do, I can tell you beforehand that you will no sooner enter\nthe Marquise's salon than you will be in despair lest she should find\nout that you are staying at the Gaillard-Bois with an apothecary's\nson, though he may wish to be called M. de Rubempre.\n\n\"You will have rivals here, women far more astute and shrewd than\nAmelie; they will not fail to discover who you are, where you are,\nwhere you come from, and all that you are doing. You have counted upon\nyour incognito, I see, but you are one of those women for whom an\nincognito is out of the question. You will meet Angouleme at every\nturn. There are the deputies from the Charente coming up for the\nopening of the session; there is the Commandant in Paris on leave.\nWhy, the first man or woman from Angouleme who happens to see you\nwould cut your career short in a strange fashion. You would simply be\nLucien's mistress.\n\n\"If you need me at any time, I am staying with the Receiver-General in\nthe Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honore, two steps away from Mme. d'Espard's.\nI am sufficiently acquainted with the Marechale de Carigliano, Mme. de\nSerizy, and the President of the Council to introduce you to those\nhouses; but you will meet so many people at Mme. d'Espard's, that you\nare not likely to require me. So far from wishing to gain admittance\nto this set or that, every one will be longing to make your\nacquaintance.\"\n\nChatelet talked on; Mme. de Bargeton made no interruption. She was\nstruck with his perspicacity. The queen of Angouleme had, in fact,\ncounted upon preserving her incognito.\n\n\"You are right, my dear friend,\" she said at length; \"but what am I to\ndo?\"\n\n\"Allow me to find suitable furnished lodgings for you,\" suggested\nChatelet; \"that way of living is less expensive than an inn. You will\nhave a home of your own; and, if you will take my advice, you will\nsleep in your new rooms this very night.\"\n\n\"But how did you know my address?\" queried she.\n\n\"Your traveling carriage is easily recognized; and, besides, I was\nfollowing you. At Sevres your postilion told mine that he had brought\nyou here. Will you permit me to act as your harbinger? I will write as\nsoon as I have found lodgings.\"\n\n\"Very well, do so,\" said she. And in those seemingly insignificant\nwords, all was said. The Baron du Chatelet had spoken the language of\nworldly wisdom to a woman of the world. He had made his appearance\nbefore her in faultless dress, a neat cab was waiting for him at the\ndoor; and Mme. de Bargeton, standing by the window thinking over the\nposition, chanced to see the elderly dandy drive away.\n\nA few moments later Lucien appeared, half awake and hastily dressed.\nHe was handsome, it is true; but his clothes, his last year's nankeen\ntrousers, and his shabby tight jacket were ridiculous. Put Antinous or\nthe Apollo Belvedere himself into a water-carrier's blouse, and how\nshall you recognize the godlike creature of the Greek or Roman chisel?\nThe eyes note and compare before the heart has time to revise the\nswift involuntary judgment; and the contrast between Lucien and\nChatelet was so abrupt that it could not fail to strike Louise.\n\nTowards six o'clock that evening, when dinner was over, Mme. de\nBargeton beckoned Lucien to sit beside her on the shabby sofa, covered\nwith a flowered chintz--a yellow pattern on a red ground.\n\n\"Lucien mine,\" she said, \"don't you think that if we have both of us\ndone a foolish thing, suicidal for both our interests, it would only\nbe common sense to set matters right? We ought not to live together in\nParis, dear boy, and we must not allow anyone to suspect that we\ntraveled together. Your career depends so much upon my position that I\nought to do nothing to spoil it. So, to-night, I am going to remove\ninto lodgings near by. But you will stay on here, we can see each\nother every day, and nobody can say a word against us.\"\n\nAnd Louise explained conventions to Lucien, who opened wide eyes. He\nhad still to learn that when a woman thinks better of her folly, she\nthinks better of her love; but one thing he understood--he saw that he\nwas no longer the Lucien of Angouleme. Louise talked of herself, of\n_her_ interests, _her_ reputation, and of the world; and, to veil her\negoism, she tried to make him believe that this was all on his\naccount. He had no claim upon Louise thus suddenly transformed into\nMme. de Bargeton, and, more serious still, he had no power over her.\nHe could not keep back the tears that filled his eyes.\n\n\"If I am your glory,\" cried the poet, \"you are yet more to me--you are\nmy one hope, my whole future rests with you. I thought that if you\nmeant to make my successes yours, you would surely make my adversity\nyours also, and here we are going to part already.\"\n\n\"You are judging my conduct,\" said she; \"you do not love me.\"\n\nLucien looked at her with such a dolorous expression, that in spite of\nherself, she said:\n\n\"Darling, I will stay if you like. We shall both be ruined, we shall\nhave no one to come to our aid. But when we are both equally wretched,\nand every one shuts their door upon us both, when failure (for we must\nlook all possibilities in the face), when failure drives us back to\nthe Escarbas, then remember, love, that I foresaw the end, and that at\nthe first I proposed that we should make your way by conforming to\nestablished rules.\"\n\n\"Louise,\" he cried, with his arms around her, \"you are wise; you\nfrighten me! Remember that I am a child, that I have given myself up\nentirely to your dear will. I myself should have preferred to overcome\nobstacles and win my way among men by the power that is in me; but if\nI can reach the goal sooner through your aid, I shall be very glad to\nowe all my success to you. Forgive me! You mean so much to me that I\ncannot help fearing all kinds of things; and, for me, parting means\nthat desertion is at hand, and desertion is death.\"\n\n\"But, my dear boy, the world's demands are soon satisfied,\" returned\nshe. \"You must sleep here; that is all. All day long you will be with\nme, and no one can say a word.\"\n\nA few kisses set Lucien's mind completely at rest. An hour later\nGentil brought in a note from Chatelet. He told Mme. de Bargeton that\nhe had found lodgings for her in the Rue Nueve-de-Luxembourg. Mme. de\nBargeton informed herself of the exact place, and found that it was\nnot very far from the Rue de l'Echelle. \"We shall be neighbors,\" she\ntold Lucien.\n\nTwo hours afterwards Louise stepped into the hired carriage sent by\nChatelet for the removal to the new rooms. The apartments were of the\nclass that upholsterers furnish and let to wealthy deputies and\npersons of consideration on a short visit to Paris--showy and\nuncomfortable. It was eleven o'clock when Lucien returned to his inn,\nhaving seen nothing as yet of Paris except the part of the Rue\nSaint-Honore which lies between the Rue Neuve-de-Luxembourg and the Rue\nde l'Echelle. He lay down in his miserable little room, and could not\nhelp comparing it in his own mind with Louise's sumptuous apartments.\n\nJust as he came away the Baron du Chatelet came in, gorgeously arrayed\nin evening dress, fresh from the Minister for Foreign Affairs, to\ninquire whether Mme. de Bargeton was satisfied with all that he had\ndone on her behalf. Nais was uneasy. The splendor was alarming to her\nmind. Provincial life had reacted upon her; she was painfully\nconscientious over her accounts, and economical to a degree that is\nlooked upon as miserly in Paris. She had brought with her twenty\nthousand francs in the shape of a draft on the Receiver-General,\nconsidering that the sum would more than cover the expenses of four\nyears in Paris; she was afraid already lest she should not have\nenough, and should run into debt; and now Chatelet told her that her\nrooms would only cost six hundred francs per month.\n\n\"A mere trifle,\" added he, seeing that Nais was startled. \"For five\nhundred francs a month you can have a carriage from a livery stable;\nfifty louis in all. You need only think of your dress. A woman moving\nin good society could not well do less; and if you mean to obtain a\nReceiver-General's appointment for M. de Bargeton, or a post in the\nHousehold, you ought not to look poverty-stricken. Here, in Paris,\nthey only give to the rich. It is most fortunate that you brought\nGentil to go out with you, and Albertine for your own woman, for\nservants are enough to ruin you here. But with your introductions you\nwill seldom be home to a meal.\"\n\nMme. de Bargeton and the Baron de Chatelet chatted about Paris.\nChatelet gave her all the news of the day, the myriad nothings that\nyou are bound to know, under penalty of being a nobody. Before very\nlong the Baron also gave advice as to shopping, recommending Herbault\nfor toques and Juliette for hats and bonnets; he added the address of\na fashionable dressmaker to supersede Victorine. In short, he made the\nlady see the necessity of rubbing off Angouleme. Then he took his\nleave after a final flash of happy inspiration.\n\n\"I expect I shall have a box at one of the theatres to-morrow,\" he\nremarked carelessly; \"I will call for you and M. de Rubempre, for you\nmust allow me to do the honors of Paris.\"\n\n\"There is more generosity in his character than I thought,\" said Mme.\nde Bargeton to herself when Lucien was included in the invitation.\n\nIn the month of June ministers are often puzzled to know what to do\nwith boxes at the theatre; ministerialist deputies and their\nconstituents are busy in their vineyards or harvest fields, and their\nmore exacting acquaintances are in the country or traveling about; so\nit comes to pass that the best seats are filled at this season with\nheterogeneous theatre-goers, never seen at any other time of year, and\nthe house is apt to look as if it were tapestried with very shabby\nmaterial. Chatelet had thought already that this was his opportunity\nof giving Nais the amusements which provincials crave most eagerly,\nand that with very little expense.\n\nThe next morning, the very first morning in Paris, Lucien went to the\nRue Nueve-de-Luxembourg and found that Louise had gone out. She had\ngone to make some indispensable purchases, to take counsel of the\nmighty and illustrious authorities in the matter of the feminine\ntoilette, pointed out to her by Chatelet, for she had written to tell\nthe Marquise d'Espard of her arrival. Mme. de Bargeton possessed the\nself-confidence born of a long habit of rule, but she was exceedingly\nafraid of appearing to be provincial. She had tact enough to know how\ngreatly the relations of women among themselves depend upon first\nimpressions; and though she felt that she was equal to taking her\nplace at once in such a distinguished set as Mme. de d'Espard's, she\nfelt also that she stood in need of goodwill at her first entrance\ninto society, and was resolved, in the first place, that she would\nleave nothing undone to secure success. So she felt boundlessly\nthankful to Chatelet for pointing out these ways of putting herself in\nharmony with the fashionable world.\n\nA singular chance so ordered it that the Marquise was delighted to\nfind an opportunity of being useful to a connection of her husband's\nfamily. The Marquis d'Espard had withdrawn himself without apparent\nreason from society, and ceased to take any active interest in\naffairs, political or domestic. His wife, thus left mistress of her\nactions, felt the need of the support of public opinion, and was glad\nto take the Marquis' place and give her countenance to one of her\nhusband's relations. She meant to be ostentatiously gracious, so as to\nput her husband more evidently in the wrong; and that very day she\nwrote, \"Mme. de Bargeton _nee_ Negrepelisse\" a charming billet, one of\nthe prettily worded compositions of which time alone can discover the\nemptiness.\n\n\n\"She was delighted that circumstances had brought a relative, of whom\nshe had heard, whose acquaintance she had desired to make, into closer\nconnection with her family. Friendships in Paris were not so solid but\nthat she longed to find one more to love on earth; and if this might\nnot be, there would only be one more illusion to bury with the rest.\nShe put herself entirely at her cousin's disposal. She would have\ncalled upon her if indisposition had not kept her to the house, and\nshe felt that she lay already under obligations to the cousin who had\nthought of her.\"\n\n\nLucien, meanwhile, taking his first ramble along the Rue de la Paix\nand through the Boulevards, like all newcomers, was much more\ninterested in the things that he saw than in the people he met. The\ngeneral effect of Paris is wholly engrossing at first. The wealth in\nthe shop windows, the high houses, the streams of traffic, the\ncontrast everywhere between the last extremes of luxury and want\nstruck him more than anything else. In his astonishment at the crowds\nof strange faces, the man of imaginative temper felt as if he himself\nhad shrunk, as it were, immensely. A man of any consequence in his\nnative place, where he cannot go out but he meets with some\nrecognition of his importance at every step, does not readily accustom\nhimself to the sudden and total extinction of his consequence. You are\nsomebody in your own country, in Paris you are nobody. The transition\nbetween the first state and the last should be made gradually, for the\ntoo abrupt fall is something like annihilation. Paris could not fail\nto be an appalling wilderness for a young poet, who looked for an echo\nfor all his sentiments, a confidant for all his thoughts, a soul to\nshare his least sensations.\n\nLucien had not gone in search of his luggage and his best blue coat;\nand painfully conscious of the shabbiness, to say no worse, of his\nclothes, he went to Mme. de Bargeton, feeling that she must have\nreturned. He found the Baron du Chatelet, who carried them both off to\ndinner at the _Rocher de Cancale_. Lucien's head was dizzy with the\nwhirl of Paris, the Baron was in the carriage, he could say nothing to\nLouise, but he squeezed her hand, and she gave a warm response to the\nmute confidence.\n\nAfter dinner Chatelet took his guests to the Vaudeville. Lucien, in\nhis heart, was not over well pleased to see Chatelet again, and cursed\nthe chance that had brought the Baron to Paris. The Baron said that\nambition had brought him to town; he had hopes of an appointment as\nsecretary-general to a government department, and meant to take a seat\nin the Council of State as Master of Requests. He had come to Paris to\nask for fulfilment of the promises that had been given him, for a man\nof his stamp could not be expected to remain a comptroller all his\nlife; he would rather be nothing at all, and offer himself for\nelection as deputy, or re-enter diplomacy. Chatelet grew visibly\ntaller; Lucien dimly began to recognize in this elderly beau the\nsuperiority of the man of the world who knows Paris; and, most of all,\nhe felt ashamed to owe his evening's amusement to his rival. And while\nthe poet looked ill at ease and awkward Her Royal Highness'\nex-secretary was quite in his element. He smiled at his rival's\nhesitations, at his astonishment, at the questions he put, at the\nlittle mistakes which the latter ignorantly made, much as an old salt\nlaughs at an apprentice who has not found his sea legs; but Lucien's\npleasure at seeing a play for the first time in Paris outweighed the\nannoyance of these small humiliations.\n\nThat evening marked an epoch in Lucien's career; he put away a good\nmany of his ideas as to provincial life in the course of it. His\nhorizon widened; society assumed different proportions. There were\nfair Parisiennes in fresh and elegant toilettes all about him; Mme. de\nBargeton's costume, tolerably ambitious though it was, looked dowdy by\ncomparison; the material, like the fashion and the color, was out of\ndate. That way of arranging her hair, so bewitching in Angouleme,\nlooked frightfully ugly here among the daintily devised coiffures\nwhich he saw in every direction.\n\n\"Will she always look like that?\" said he to himself, ignorant that\nthe morning had been spent in preparing a transformation.\n\nIn the provinces comparison and choice are out of the question; when a\nface has grown familiar it comes to possess a certain beauty that is\ntaken for granted. But transport the pretty woman of the provinces to\nParis, and no one takes the slightest notice of her; her prettiness is\nof the comparative degree illustrated by the saying that among the\nblind the one-eyed are kings. Lucien's eyes were now busy comparing\nMme. de Bargeton with other women, just as she herself had contrasted\nhim with Chatelet on the previous day. And Mme. de Bargeton, on her\npart, permitted herself some strange reflections upon her lover. The\npoet cut a poor figure notwithstanding his singular beauty. The\nsleeves of his jacket were too short; with his ill-cut country gloves\nand a waistcoat too scanty for him, he looked prodigiously ridiculous,\ncompared with the young men in the balcony--\"positively pitiable,\"\nthought Mme. de Bargeton. Chatelet, interested in her without\npresumption, taking care of her in a manner that revealed a profound\npassion; Chatelet, elegant, and as much at home as an actor treading\nthe familiar boards of his theatre, in two days had recovered all the\nground lost in the past six months.\n\nOrdinary people will not admit that our sentiments towards each other\ncan totally change in a moment, and yet certain it is, that two lovers\nnot seldom fly apart even more quickly than they drew together. In\nMme. de Bargeton and in Lucien a process of disenchantment was at\nwork; Paris was the cause. Life had widened out before the poet's\neyes, as society came to wear a new aspect for Louise. Nothing but an\naccident now was needed to sever finally the bond that united them;\nnor was that blow, so terrible for Lucien, very long delayed.\n\nMme. de Bargeton set Lucien down at his inn, and drove home with\nChatelet, to the intense vexation of the luckless lover.\n\n\"What will they say about me?\" he wondered, as he climbed the stairs\nto his dismal room.\n\n\"That poor fellow is uncommonly dull,\" said Chatelet, with a smile,\nwhen the door was closed.\n\n\"That is the way with those who have a world of thoughts in their\nheart and brain. Men who have so much in them to give out in great\nworks long dreamed of, profess a certain contempt for conversation, a\ncommerce in which the intellect spends itself in small change,\"\nreturned the haughty Negrepelisse. She still had courage to defend\nLucien, but less for Lucien's sake than for her own.\n\n\"I grant it you willingly,\" replied the Baron, \"but we live with human\nbeings and not with books. There, dear Nais! I see how it is, there is\nnothing between you yet, and I am delighted that it is so. If you\ndecide to bring an interest of a kind hitherto lacking into your life,\nlet it not be this so-called genius, I implore you. How if you have\nmade a mistake? Suppose that in a few days' time, when you have\ncompared him with men whom you will meet, men of real ability, men who\nhave distinguished themselves in good earnest; suppose that you should\ndiscover, dear and fair siren, that it is no lyre-bearer that you have\nborne into port on your dazzling shoulders, but a little ape, with no\nmanners and no capacity; a presumptuous fool who may be a wit in\nL'Houmeau, but turns out a very ordinary specimen of a young man in\nParis? And, after all, volumes of verse come out every week here, the\nworst of them better than all M. Chardon's poetry put together. For\npity's sake, wait and compare! To-morrow, Friday, is Opera night,\" he\ncontinued as the carriage turned into the Rue Nueve-de-Luxembourg;\n\"Mme. d'Espard has the box of the First Gentlemen of the Chamber, and\nwill take you, no doubt. I shall go to Mme. de Serizy's box to behold\nyou in your glory. They are giving _Les Danaides_.\"\n\n\"Good-bye,\" said she.\n\nNext morning Mme. de Bargeton tried to arrange a suitable toilette in\nwhich to call on her cousin, Mme. d'Espard. The weather was rather\nchilly. Looking through the dowdy wardrobe from Angouleme, she found\nnothing better than a certain green velvet gown, trimmed fantastically\nenough. Lucien, for his part, felt that he must go at once for his\ncelebrated blue best coat; he felt aghast at the thought of his tight\njacket, and determined to be well dressed, lest he should meet the\nMarquise d'Espard or receive a sudden summons to her house. He must\nhave his luggage at once, so he took a cab, and in two hours' time\nspent three or four francs, matter for much subsequent reflection on\nthe scale of the cost of living in Paris. Having dressed himself in\nhis best, such as it was, he went to the Rue Nueve-de-Luxembourg, and\non the doorstep encountered Gentil in company with a gorgeously\nbe-feathered chasseur.\n\n\"I was just going round to you, sir, madame gave me a line for you,\"\nsaid Gentil, ignorant of Parisian forms of respect, and accustomed to\nhomely provincial ways. The chasseur took the poet for a servant.\n\nLucien tore open the note, and learned that Mme. de Bargeton had gone\nto spend the day with the Marquise d'Espard. She was going to the\nOpera in the evening, but she told Lucien to be there to meet her. Her\ncousin permitted her to give him a seat in her box. The Marquise\nd'Espard was delighted to procure the young poet that pleasure.\n\n\"Then she loves me! my fears were all nonsense!\" said Lucien to\nhimself. \"She is going to present me to her cousin this very evening.\"\n\nHe jumped for joy. He would spend the day that separated him from the\nhappy evening as joyously as might be. He dashed out in the direction\nof the Tuileries, dreaming of walking there until it was time to dine\nat Very's. And now, behold Lucien frisking and skipping, light of foot\nbecause light of heart, on his way to the Terrasse des Feuillants to\ntake a look at the people of quality on promenade there. Pretty women\nwalk arm-in-arm with men of fashion, their adorers, couples greet each\nother with a glance as they pass; how different it is from the terrace\nat Beaulieu! How far finer the birds on this perch than the Angouleme\nspecies! It is as if you beheld all the colors that glow in the\nplumage of the feathered tribes of India and America, instead of the\nsober European families.\n\nThose were two wretched hours that Lucien spent in the Garden of the\nTuileries. A violent revulsion swept through him, and he sat in\njudgment upon himself.\n\nIn the first place, not a single one of these gilded youths wore a\nswallow-tail coat. The few exceptions, one or two poor wretches, a\nclerk here and there, an annuitant from the Marais, could be ruled out\non the score of age; and hard upon the discovery of a distinction\nbetween morning and evening dress, the poet's quick sensibility and\nkeen eyes saw likewise that his shabby old clothes were not fit to be\nseen; the defects in his coat branded that garment as ridiculous; the\ncut was old-fashioned, the color was the wrong shade of blue, the\ncollar outrageously ungainly, the coat tails, by dint of long wear,\noverlapped each other, the buttons were reddened, and there were fatal\nwhite lines along the seams. Then his waistcoat was too short, and so\ngrotesquely provincial, that he hastily buttoned his coat over it;\nand, finally, no man of any pretension to fashion wore nankeen\ntrousers. Well-dressed men wore charming fancy materials or immaculate\nwhite, and every one had straps to his trousers, while the shrunken\nhems of Lucien's nether garments manifested a violent antipathy for\nthe heels of boots which they wedded with obvious reluctance. Lucien\nwore a white cravat with embroidered ends; his sister had seen that M.\ndu Hautoy and M. de Chandour wore such things, and hastened to make\nsimilar ones for her brother. Here, no one appeared to wear white\ncravats of a morning except a few grave seniors, elderly capitalists,\nand austere public functionaries, until, in the street on the other\nside of the railings, Lucien noticed a grocer's boy walking along the\nRue de Rivoli with a basket on his head; him the man of Angouleme\ndetected in the act of sporting a cravat, with both ends adorned by\nthe handiwork of some adored shop-girl. The sight was a stab to\nLucien's breast; penetrating straight to that organ as yet undefined,\nthe seat of our sensibility, the region whither, since sentiment has\nhad any existence, the sons of men carry their hands in any excess of\njoy or anguish. Do not accuse this chronicle of puerility. The rich,\nto be sure, never having experienced sufferings of this kind, may\nthink them incredibly petty and small; but the agonies of less\nfortunate mortals are as well worth our attention as crises and\nvicissitudes in the lives of the mighty and privileged ones of earth.\nIs not the pain equally great for either? Suffering exalts all things.\nAnd, after all, suppose that we change the terms and for a suit of\nclothes, more or less fine, put instead a ribbon, or a star, or a\ntitle; have not brilliant careers been tormented by reason of such\napparent trifles as these? Add, moreover, that for those people who\nmust seem to have that which they have not, the question of clothes is\nof enormous importance, and not unfrequently the appearance of\npossession is the shortest road to possession at a later day.\n\nA cold sweat broke out over Lucien as he bethought himself that\nto-night he must make his first appearance before the Marquise in this\ndress--the Marquise d'Espard, relative of a First Gentleman of the\nBedchamber, a woman whose house was frequented by the most illustrious\namong illustrious men in every field.\n\n\"I look like an apothecary's son, a regular shop-drudge,\" he raged\ninwardly, watching the youth of the Faubourg Saint-Germain pass under\nhis eyes; graceful, spruce, fashionably dressed, with a certain\nuniformity of air, a sameness due to a fineness of contour, and a\ncertain dignity of carriage and expression; though, at the same time,\neach one differed from the rest in the setting by which he had chosen\nto bring his personal characteristics into prominence. Each one made\nthe most of his personal advantages. Young men in Paris understand the\nart of presenting themselves quite as well as women. Lucien had\ninherited from his mother the invaluable physical distinction of race,\nbut the metal was still in the ore, and not set free by the\ncraftsman's hand.\n\nHis hair was badly cut. Instead of holding himself upright with an\nelastic corset, he felt that he was cooped up inside a hideous\nshirt-collar; he hung his dejected head without resistance on the part\nof a limp cravat. What woman could guess that a handsome foot was\nhidden by the clumsy boots which he had brought from Angouleme? What\nyoung man could envy him his graceful figure, disguised by the\nshapeless blue sack which hitherto he had mistakenly believed to be a\ncoat? What bewitching studs he saw on those dazzling white shirt\nfronts, his own looked dingy by comparison; and how marvelously all\nthese elegant persons were gloved, his own gloves were only fit for a\npoliceman! Yonder was a youth toying with a cane exquisitely mounted;\nthere, another with dainty gold studs in his wristbands. Yet another\nwas twisting a charming riding-whip while he talked with a woman;\nthere were specks of mud on the ample folds of his white trousers, he\nwore clanking spurs and a tight-fitting jacket, evidently he was about\nto mount one of the two horses held by a hop-o'-my-thumb of a tiger. A\nyoung man who went past drew a watch no thicker than a five-franc\npiece from his pocket, and looked at it with the air of a person who\nis either too early or too late for an appointment.\n\nLucien, seeing these petty trifles, hitherto unimagined, became aware\nof a whole world of indispensable superfluities, and shuddered to\nthink of the enormous capital needed by a professional pretty fellow!\nThe more he admired these gay and careless beings, the more conscious\nhe grew of his own outlandishness; he knew that he looked like a man\nwho has no idea of the direction of the streets, who stands close to\nthe Palais Royal and cannot find it, and asks his way to the Louvre of\na passer-by, who tells him, \"Here you are.\" Lucien saw a great gulf\nfixed between him and this new world, and asked himself how he might\ncross over, for he meant to be one of these delicate, slim youths of\nParis, these young patricians who bowed before women divinely dressed\nand divinely fair. For one kiss from one of these, Lucien was ready to\nbe cut in pieces like Count Philip of Konigsmark. Louise's face rose\nup somewhere in the shadowy background of memory--compared with these\nqueens, she looked like an old woman. He saw women whose names will\nappear in the history of the nineteenth century, women no less famous\nthan the queens of past times for their wit, their beauty, or their\nlovers; one who passed was the heroine Mlle. des Touches, so well\nknown as Camille Maupin, the great woman of letters, great by her\nintellect, great no less by her beauty. He overheard the name\npronounced by those who went by.\n\n\"Ah!\" he thought to himself, \"she is Poetry.\"\n\nWhat was Mme. de Bargeton in comparison with this angel in all the\nglory of youth, and hope, and promise of the future, with that sweet\nsmile of hers, and the great dark eyes with all heaven in them, and\nthe glowing light of the sun? She was laughing and chatting with Mme.\nFirmiani, one of the most charming women in Paris. A voice indeed\ncried, \"Intellect is the lever by which to move the world,\" but\nanother voice cried no less loudly that money was the fulcrum.\n\nHe would not stay any longer on the scene of his collapse and defeat,\nand went towards the Palais Royal. He did not know the topography of\nhis quarter yet, and was obliged to ask his way. Then he went to\nVery's and ordered dinner by way of an initiation into the pleasures\nof Paris, and a solace for his discouragement. A bottle of Bordeaux,\noysters from Ostend, a dish of fish, a partridge, a dish of macaroni\nand dessert,--this was the _ne plus ultra_ of his desire. He enjoyed\nthis little debauch, studying the while how to give the Marquise\nd'Espard proof of his wit, and redeem the shabbiness of his grotesque\naccoutrements by the display of intellectual riches. The total of the\nbill drew him down from these dreams, and left him the poorer by fifty\nof the francs which were to have gone such a long way in Paris. He\ncould have lived in Angouleme for a month on the price of that dinner.\nWherefore he closed the door of the palace with awe, thinking as he\ndid so that he should never set foot in it again.\n\n\"Eve was right,\" he said to himself, as he went back under the stone\narcading for some more money. \"There is a difference between Paris\nprices and prices in L'Houmeau.\"\n\nHe gazed in at the tailors' windows on the way, and thought of the\ncostumes in the Garden of the Tuileries.\n\n\"No,\" he exclaimed, \"I will _not_ appear before Mme. d'Espard dressed\nout as I am.\"\n\nHe fled to his inn, fleet as a stag, rushed up to his room, took out a\nhundred crowns, and went down again to the Palais Royal, where his\nfuture elegance lay scattered over half a score of shops. The first\ntailor whose door he entered tried as many coats upon him as he would\nconsent to put on, and persuaded his customer that all were in the\nvery latest fashion. Lucien came out the owner of a green coat, a pair\nof white trousers, and a \"fancy waistcoat,\" for which outfit he gave\ntwo hundred francs. Ere long he found a very elegant pair of\nready-made shoes that fitted his foot; and, finally, when he had made\nall necessary purchases, he ordered the tradespeople to send them to his\naddress, and inquired for a hairdresser. At seven o'clock that evening\nhe called a cab and drove away to the Opera, curled like a Saint John\nof a Procession Day, elegantly waistcoated and gloved, but feeling a\nlittle awkward in this kind of sheath in which he found himself for\nthe first time.\n\nIn obedience to Mme. de Bargeton's instructions, he asked for the box\nreserved for the First Gentleman of the Bedchamber. The man at the box\noffice looked at him, and beholding Lucien in all the grandeur assumed\nfor the occasion, in which he looked like a best man at a wedding,\nasked Lucien for his order.\n\n\"I have no order.\"\n\n\"Then you cannot go in,\" said the man at the box office drily.\n\n\"But I belong to Mme. d'Espard's party.\"\n\n\"It is not our business to know that,\" said the man, who could not\nhelp exchanging a barely perceptible smile with his colleague.\n\nA carriage stopped under the peristyle as he spoke. A chasseur, in a\nlivery which Lucien did not recognize, let down the step, and two\nwomen in evening dress came out of the brougham. Lucien had no mind to\nlay himself open to an insolent order to get out of the way from the\nofficial. He stepped aside to let the two ladies pass.\n\n\"Why, that lady is the Marquise d'Espard, whom you say you know, sir,\"\nsaid the man ironically.\n\nLucien was so much the more confounded because Mme. de Bargeton did\nnot seem to recognize him in his new plumage; but when he stepped up\nto her, she smiled at him and said:\n\n\"This has fallen out wonderfully--come!\"\n\nThe functionaries at the box office grew serious again as Lucien\nfollowed Mme. de Bargeton. On their way up the great staircase the\nlady introduced M. de Rubempre to her cousin. The box belonging to the\nFirst Gentleman of the Bedchamber is situated in one of the angles at\nthe back of the house, so that its occupants see and are seen all over\nthe theatre. Lucien took his seat on a chair behind Mme. de Bargeton,\nthankful to be in the shadow.\n\n\"M. de Rubempre,\" said the Marquise with flattering graciousness,\n\"this is your first visit to the Opera, is it not? You must have a\nview of the house; take this seat, sit in front of the box; we give\nyou permission.\"\n\nLucien obeyed as the first act came to an end.\n\n\"You have made good use of your time,\" Louise said in his ear, in her\nfirst surprise at the change in his appearance.\n\nLouise was still the same. The near presence of the Marquise d'Espard,\na Parisian Mme. de Bargeton, was so damaging to her; the brilliancy of\nthe Parisienne brought out all the defects in her country cousin so\nclearly by contrast; that Lucien, looking out over the fashionable\naudience in the superb building, and then at the great lady, was twice\nenlightened, and saw poor Anais de Negrepelisse as she really was, as\nParisians saw her--a tall, lean, withered woman, with a pimpled face\nand faded complexion; angular, stiff, affected in her manner; pompous\nand provincial in her speech; and, and above all these things, dowdily\ndressed. As a matter of fact, the creases in an old dress from Paris\nstill bear witness to good taste, you can tell what the gown was meant\nfor; but an old dress made in the country is inexplicable, it is a\nthing to provoke laughter. There was neither charm nor freshness about\nthe dress or its wearer; the velvet, like the complexion had seen\nwear. Lucien felt ashamed to have fallen in love with this cuttle-fish\nbone, and vowed that he would profit by Louise's next fit of virtue to\nleave her for good. Having an excellent view of the house, he could\nsee the opera-glasses pointed at the aristocratic box par excellence.\nThe best-dressed women must certainly be scrutinizing Mme. de\nBargeton, for they smiled and talked among themselves.\n\nIf Mme. d'Espard knew the object of their sarcasms from those feminine\nsmiles and gestures, she was perfectly insensible to them. In the\nfirst place, anybody must see that her companion was a poor relation\nfrom the country, an affliction with which any Parisian family may be\nvisited. And, in the second, when her cousin had spoken to her of her\ndress with manifest misgivings, she had reassured Anais, seeing that,\nwhen once properly dressed, her relative would very easily acquire the\ntone of Parisian society. If Mme. de Bargeton needed polish, on the\nother hand she possessed the native haughtiness of good birth, and\nthat indescribable something which may be called \"pedigree.\" So, on\nMonday her turn would come. And, moreover, the Marquise knew that as\nsoon as people learned that the stranger was her cousin, they would\nsuspend their banter and look twice before they condemned her.\n\nLucien did not foresee the change in Louise's appearance shortly to be\nworked by a scarf about her throat, a pretty dress, an elegant\ncoiffure, and Mme. d'Espard's advice. As they came up the staircase\neven now, the Marquise told her cousin not to hold her handkerchief\nunfolded in her hand. Good or bad taste turns upon hundreds of such\nalmost imperceptible shades, which a quick-witted woman discerns at\nonce, while others will never grasp them. Mme. de Bargeton,\nplentifully apt, was more than clever enough to discover her\nshortcomings. Mme. d'Espard, sure that her pupil would do her credit,\ndid not decline to form her. In short, the compact between the two\nwomen had been confirmed by self-interest on either side.\n\nMme. de Bargeton, enthralled, dazzled, and fascinated by her cousin's\nmanner, wit, and acquaintances, had suddenly declared herself a votary\nof the idol of the day. She had discerned the signs of the occult\npower exerted by the ambitious great lady, and told herself that she\ncould gain her end as the satellite of this star, so she had been\noutspoken in her admiration. The Marquise was not insensible to the\nartlessly admitted conquest. She took an interest in her cousin,\nseeing that she was weak and poor; she was, besides, not indisposed to\ntake a pupil with whom to found a school, and asked nothing better\nthan to have a sort of lady-in-waiting in Mme. de Bargeton, a\ndependent who would sing her praises, a treasure even more scarce\namong Parisian women than a staunch and loyal critic among the\nliterary tribe. The flutter of curiosity in the house was too marked\nto be ignored, however, and Mme. d'Espard politely endeavored to turn\nher cousin's mind from the truth.\n\n\"If any one comes to our box,\" she said, \"perhaps we may discover the\ncause to which we owe the honor of the interest that these ladies are\ntaking----\"\n\n\"I have a strong suspicion that it is my old velvet gown and\nAngoumoisin air which Parisian ladies find amusing,\" Mme. de Bargeton\nanswered, laughing.\n\n\"No, it is not you; it is something that I cannot explain,\" she added,\nturning to the poet, and, as she looked at him for the first time, it\nseemed to strike her that he was singularly dressed.\n\n\"There is M. du Chatelet,\" exclaimed Lucien at that moment, and he\npointed a finger towards Mme. de Serizy's box, which the renovated\nbeau had just entered.\n\nMme. de Bargeton bit her lips with chagrin as she saw that gesture,\nand saw besides the Marquise's ill-suppressed smile of contemptuous\nastonishment. \"Where does the young man come from?\" her look said, and\nLouise felt humbled through her love, one of the sharpest of all pangs\nfor a Frenchwoman, a mortification for which she cannot forgive her\nlover.\n\nIn these circles where trifles are of such importance, a gesture or a\nword at the outset is enough to ruin a newcomer. It is the principal\nmerit of fine manners and the highest breeding that they produce the\neffect of a harmonious whole, in which every element is so blended\nthat nothing is startling or obtrusive. Even those who break the laws\nof this science, either through ignorance or carried away by some\nimpulse, must comprehend that it is with social intercourse as with\nmusic, a single discordant note is a complete negation of the art\nitself, for the harmony exists only when all its conditions are\nobserved down to the least particular.\n\n\"Who is that gentleman?\" asked Mme. d'Espard, looking towards\nChatelet. \"And have you made Mme. de Serizy's acquaintance already?\"\n\n\"Oh! is that the famous Mme. de Serizy who has had so many adventures\nand yet goes everywhere?\"\n\n\"An unheard-of-thing, my dear, explicable but unexplained. The most\nformidable men are her friends, and why? Nobody dares to fathom the\nmystery. Then is this person the lion of Angouleme?\"\n\n\"Well, M. le Baron du Chatelet has been a good deal talked about,\"\nanswered Mme. de Bargeton, moved by vanity to give her adorer the\ntitle which she herself had called in question. \"He was M. de\nMontriveau's traveling companion.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said the Marquise d'Espard, \"I never hear that name without\nthinking of the Duchesse de Langeais, poor thing. She vanished like a\nfalling star.--That is M. de Rastignac with Mme. de Nucingen,\" she\ncontinued, indicating another box; \"she is the wife of a contractor, a\nbanker, a city man, a broker on a large scale; he forced his way into\nsociety with his money, and they say that he is not very scrupulous as\nto his methods of making it. He is at endless pains to establish his\ncredit as a staunch upholder of the Bourbons, and has tried already to\ngain admittance into my set. When his wife took Mme. de Langeais' box,\nshe thought that she could take her charm, her wit, and her success as\nwell. It is the old fable of the jay in the peacock's feathers!\"\n\n\"How do M. and Mme. de Rastignac manage to keep their son in Paris,\nwhen, as we know, their income is under a thousand crowns?\" asked\nLucien, in his astonishment at Rastignac's elegant and expensive\ndress.\n\n\"It is easy to see that you come from Angouleme,\" said Mme. d'Espard,\nironically enough, as she continued to gaze through her opera-glass.\n\nHer remark was lost upon Lucien; the all-absorbing spectacle of the\nboxes prevented him from thinking of anything else. He guessed that he\nhimself was an object of no small curiosity. Louise, on the other\nhand, was exceedingly mortified by the evident slight esteem in which\nthe Marquise held Lucien's beauty.\n\n\"He cannot be so handsome as I thought him,\" she said to herself; and\nbetween \"not so handsome\" and \"not so clever as I thought him\" there\nwas but one step.\n\nThe curtain fell. Chatelet was now paying a visit to the Duchesse de\nCarigliano in an adjourning box; Mme. de Bargeton acknowledged his bow\nby a slight inclination of the head. Nothing escapes a woman of the\nworld; Chatelet's air of distinction was not lost upon Mme. d'Espard.\nJust at that moment four personages, four Parisian celebrities, came\ninto the box, one after another.\n\nThe most striking feature of the first comer, M. de Marsay, famous for\nthe passions which he had inspired, was his girlish beauty; but its\nsoftness and effeminacy were counteracted by the expression of his\neyes, unflinching, steady, untamed, and hard as a tiger's. He was\nloved and he was feared. Lucien was no less handsome; but Lucien's\nexpression was so gentle, his blue eyes so limpid, that he scarcely\nseemed to possess the strength and the power which attract women so\nstrongly. Nothing, moreover, so far had brought out the poet's merits;\nwhile de Marsay, with his flow of spirits, his confidence in his power\nto please, and appropriate style of dress, eclipsed every rival by his\npresence. Judge, therefore, the kind of figure that Lucien, stiff,\nstarched, unbending in clothes as new and unfamiliar as his\nsurroundings, was likely to cut in de Marsay's vicinity. De Marsay\nwith his wit and charm of manner was privileged to be insolent. From\nMme. d'Espard's reception of this personage his importance was at once\nevident to Mme. de Bargeton.\n\nThe second comer was a Vandenesse, the cause of the scandal in which\nLady Dudley was concerned. Felix de Vandenesse, amiable, intellectual,\nand modest, had none of the characteristics on which de Marsay prided\nhimself, and owed his success to diametrically opposed qualities. He\nhad been warmly recommended to Mme. d'Espard by her cousin Mme. de\nMortsauf.\n\nThe third was General de Montriveau, the author of the Duchesse de\nLangeais' ruin.\n\nThe fourth, M. de Canalis, one of the most famous poets of the day,\nand as yet a newly risen celebrity, was prouder of his birth than of\nhis genius, and dangled in Mme. d'Espard's train by way of concealing\nhis love for the Duchesse de Chaulieu. In spite of his graces and the\naffectation that spoiled them, it was easy to discern the vast,\nlurking ambitions that plunged him at a later day into the storms of\npolitical life. A face that might be called insignificantly pretty and\ncaressing manners thinly disguised the man's deeply-rooted egoism and\nhabit of continually calculating the chances of a career which at that\ntime looked problematical enough; though his choice of Mme. de\nChaulieu (a woman past forty) made interest for him at Court, and\nbrought him the applause of the Faubourg Saint-Germain and the gibes\nof the Liberal party, who dubbed him \"the poet of the sacristy.\"\n\nMme. de Bargeton, with these remarkable figures before her, no longer\nwondered at the slight esteem in which the Marquise held Lucien's good\nlooks. And when conversation began, when intellects so keen, so\nsubtle, were revealed in two-edged words with more meaning and depth\nin them than Anais de Bargeton heard in a month of talk at Angouleme;\nand, most of all, when Canalis uttered a sonorous phrase, summing up a\nmaterialistic epoch, and gilding it with poetry--then Anais felt all\nthe truth of Chatelet's dictum of the previous evening. Lucien was\nnothing to her now. Every one cruelly ignored the unlucky stranger; he\nwas so much like a foreigner listening to an unknown language, that\nthe Marquise d'Espard took pity upon him. She turned to Canalis.\n\n\"Permit me to introduce M. de Rubempre,\" she said. \"You rank too high\nin the world of letters not to welcome a _debutant_. M. de Rubempre is\nfrom Angouleme, and will need your influence, no doubt, with the\npowers that bring genius to light. So far, he has no enemies to help\nhim to success by their attacks upon him. Is there enough originality\nin the idea of obtaining for him by friendship all that hatred has\ndone for you to tempt you to make the experiment?\"\n\nThe four newcomers all looked at Lucien while the Marquise was\nspeaking. De Marsay, only a couple of paces away, put up an eyeglass\nand looked from Lucien to Mme. de Bargeton, and then again at Lucien,\ncoupling them with some mocking thought, cruelly mortifying to both.\nHe scrutinized them as if they had been a pair of strange animals, and\nthen he smiled. The smile was like a stab to the distinguished\nprovincial. Felix de Vandenesse assumed a charitable air. Montriveau\nlooked Lucien through and through.\n\n\"Madame,\" M. de Canalis answered with a bow, \"I will obey you, in\nspite of the selfish instinct which prompts us to show a rival no\nfavor; but you have accustomed us to miracles.\"\n\n\"Very well, do me the pleasure of dining with me on Monday with M. de\nRubempre, and you can talk of matters literary at your ease. I will\ntry to enlist some of the tyrants of the world of letters and the\ngreat people who protect them, the author of _Ourika_, and one or two\nyoung poets with sound views.\"\n\n\"Mme. la Marquise,\" said de Marsay, \"if you give your support to this\ngentleman for his intellect, I will support him for his good looks. I\nwill give him advice which will put him in a fair way to be the\nluckiest dandy in Paris. After that, he may be a poet--if he has a\nmind.\"\n\nMme. de Bargeton thanked her cousin by a grateful glance.\n\n\"I did not know that you were jealous of intellect,\" Montriveau said,\nturning to de Marsay; \"good fortune is the death of a poet.\"\n\n\"Is that why your lordship is thinking of marriage?\" inquired the\ndandy, addressing Canalis, and watching Mme. d'Espard to see if the\nwords went home.\n\nCanalis shrugged his shoulders, and Mme. d'Espard, Mme. de Chaulieu's\nniece, began to laugh. Lucien in his new clothes felt as if he were an\nEgyptian statue in its narrow sheath; he was ashamed that he had\nnothing to say for himself all this while. At length he turned to the\nMarquise.\n\n\"After all your kindness, madame, I am pledged to make no failures,\"\nhe said in those soft tones of his.\n\nChatelet came in as he spoke; he had seen Montriveau, and by hook or\ncrook snatched at the chance of a good introduction to the Marquise\nd'Espard through one of the kings of Paris. He bowed to Mme. de\nBargeton, and begged Mme. d'Espard to pardon him for the liberty he\ntook in invading her box; he had been separated so long from his\ntraveling companion! Montriveau and Chatelet met for the first time\nsince they parted in the desert.\n\n\"To part in the desert, and meet again in the opera-house!\" said\nLucien.\n\n\"Quite a theatrical meeting!\" said Canalis.\n\nMontriveau introduced the Baron du Chatelet to the Marquise, and the\nMarquise received Her Royal Highness' ex-secretary the more graciously\nbecause she had seen that he had been very well received in three\nboxes already. Mme. de Serizy knew none but unexceptionable people,\nand moreover he was Montriveau's traveling companion. So potent was\nthis last credential, that Mme. de Bargeton saw from the manner of the\ngroup that they accepted Chatelet as one of themselves without demur.\nChatelet's sultan's airs in Angouleme were suddenly explained.\n\nAt length the Baron saw Lucien, and favored him with a cool,\ndisparaging little nod, indicative to men of the world of the\nrecipient's inferior station. A sardonic expression accompanied the\ngreeting, \"How does _he_ come here?\" he seemed to say. This was not lost\non those who saw it; for de Marsay leaned towards Montriveau, and said\nin tones audible to Chatelet:\n\n\"Do ask him who the queer-looking young fellow is that looks like a\ndummy at a tailor's shop-door.\"\n\nChatelet spoke a few words in his traveling companion's ear, and while\napparently renewing his acquaintance, no doubt cut his rival to\npieces.\n\nIf Lucien was surprised at the apt wit and the subtlety with which\nthese gentlemen formulated their replies, he felt bewildered with\nepigram and repartee, and, most of all, by their offhand way of\ntalking and their ease of manner. The material luxury of Paris had\nalarmed him that morning; at night he saw the same lavish expenditure\nof intellect. By what mysterious means, he asked himself, did these\npeople make such piquant reflections on the spur of the moment, those\nrepartees which he could only have made after much pondering? And not\nonly were they at ease in their speech, they were at ease in their\ndress, nothing looked new, nothing looked old, nothing about them was\nconspicuous, everything attracted the eyes. The fine gentleman of\nto-day was the same yesterday, and would be the same to-morrow. Lucien\nguessed that he himself looked as if he were dressed for the first\ntime in his life.\n\n\"My dear fellow,\" said de Marsay, addressing Felix de Vandenesse,\n\"that young Rastignac is soaring away like a paper-kite. Look at him\nin the Marquise de Listomere's box; he is making progress, he is\nputting up his eyeglass at us! He knows this gentleman, no doubt,\"\nadded the dandy, speaking to Lucien, and looking elsewhere.\n\n\"He can scarcely fail to have heard the name of a great man of whom we\nare proud,\" said Mme. de Bargeton. \"Quite lately his sister was\npresent when M. de Rubempre read us some very fine poetry.\"\n\nFelix de Vandenesse and de Marsay took leave of the Marquise d'Espard,\nand went off to Mme. de Listomere, Vandenesse's sister. The second act\nbegan, and the three were left to themselves again. The curious women\nlearned how Mme. de Bargeton came to be there from some of the party,\nwhile the others announced the arrival of a poet, and made fun of his\ncostume. Canalis went back to the Duchesse de Chaulieu, and no more\nwas seen of him.\n\nLucien was glad when the rising of the curtain produced a diversion.\nAll Mme. de Bargeton's misgivings with regard to Lucien were increased\nby the marked attention which the Marquise d'Espard had shown to\nChatelet; her manner towards the Baron was very different from the\npatronizing affability with which she treated Lucien. Mme. de\nListomere's box was full during the second act, and, to all\nappearance, the talk turned upon Mme. de Bargeton and Lucien. Young\nRastignac evidently was entertaining the party; he had raised the\nlaughter that needs fresh fuel every day in Paris, the laughter that\nseizes upon a topic and exhausts it, and leaves it stale and\nthreadbare in a moment. Mme. d'Espard grew uneasy. She knew that an\nill-natured speech is not long in coming to the ears of those whom it\nwill wound, and waited till the end of the act.\n\nAfter a revulsion of feeling such as had taken place in Mme. de\nBargeton and Lucien, strange things come to pass in a brief space of\ntime, and any revolution within us is controlled by laws that work\nwith great swiftness. Chatelet's sage and politic words as to Lucien,\nspoken on the way home from the Vaudeville, were fresh in Louise's\nmemory. Every phrase was a prophecy, it seemed as if Lucien had set\nhimself to fulfil the predictions one by one. When Lucien and Mme. de\nBargeton had parted with their illusions concerning each other, the\nluckless youth, with a destiny not unlike Rousseau's, went so far in\nhis predecessor's footsteps that he was captivated by the great lady\nand smitten with Mme. d'Espard at first sight. Young men and men who\nremember their young emotions can see that this was only what might\nhave been looked for. Mme. d'Espard with her dainty ways, her delicate\nenunciation, and the refined tones of her voice; the fragile woman so\nenvied, of such high place and high degree, appeared before the poet\nas Mme. de Bargeton had appeared to him in Angouleme. His fickle\nnature prompted him to desire influence in that lofty sphere at once,\nand the surest way to secure such influence was to possess the woman\nwho exerted it, and then everything would be his. He had succeeded at\nAngouleme, why should he not succeed in Paris?\n\nInvoluntarily, and despite the novel counter fascination of the stage,\nhis eyes turned to the Celimene in her splendor; he glanced furtively\nat her every moment; the longer he looked, the more he desired to look\nat her. Mme. de Bargeton caught the gleam in Lucien's eyes, and saw\nthat he found the Marquise more interesting than the opera. If Lucien\nhad forsaken her for the fifty daughters of Danaus, she could have\nborne his desertion with equanimity; but another glance--bolder, more\nardent and unmistakable than any before--revealed the state of\nLucien's feelings. She grew jealous, but not so much for the future as\nfor the past.\n\n\"He never gave me such a look,\" she thought. \"Dear me! Chatelet was\nright!\"\n\nThen she saw that she had made a mistake; and when a woman once begins\nto repent of her weaknesses, she sponges out the whole past. Every one\nof Lucien's glances roused her indignation, but to all outward\nappearance she was calm. De Marsay came back in the interval, bringing\nM. de Listomere with him; and that serious person and the young\ncoxcomb soon informed the Marquise that the wedding guest in his\nholiday suit, whom she had the bad luck to have in her box, had as\nmuch right to the appellation of Rubempre as a Jew to a baptismal\nname. Lucien's father was an apothecary named Chardon. M. de\nRastignac, who knew all about Angouleme, had set several boxes\nlaughing already at the mummy whom the Marquise styled her cousin, and\nat the Marquise's forethought in having an apothecary at hand to\nsustain an artificial life with drugs. In short, de Marsay brought a\nselection from the thousand-and-one jokes made by Parisians on the\nspur of the moment, and no sooner uttered than forgotten. Chatelet was\nat the back of it all, and the real author of this Punic faith.\n\nMme. d'Espard turned to Mme. de Bargeton, put up her fan, and said,\n\"My dear, tell me if your protege's name is really M. de Rubempre?\"\n\n\"He has assumed his mother's name,\" said Anais, uneasily.\n\n\"But who was his father?\"\n\n\"His father's name was Chardon.\"\n\n\"And what was this Chardon?\"\n\n\"A druggist.\"\n\n\"My dear friend, I felt quite sure that all Paris could not be\nlaughing at any one whom I took up. I do not care to stay here when\nwags come in in high glee because there is an apothecary's son in my\nbox. If you will follow my advice, we will leave it, and at once.\"\n\nMme. d'Espard's expression was insolent enough; Lucien was at a loss\nto account for her change of countenance. He thought that his\nwaistcoat was in bad taste, which was true; and that his coat looked\nlike a caricature of the fashion, which was likewise true. He\ndiscerned, in bitterness of soul, that he must put himself in the\nhands of an expert tailor, and vowed that he would go the very next\nmorning to the most celebrated artist in Paris. On Monday he would\nhold his own with the men in the Marquise's house.\n\nYet, lost in thought though he was, he saw the third act to an end,\nand, with his eyes fixed on the gorgeous scene upon the stage, dreamed\nout his dream of Mme. d'Espard. He was in despair over her sudden\ncoldness; it gave a strange check to the ardent reasoning through\nwhich he advanced upon this new love, undismayed by the immense\ndifficulties in the way, difficulties which he saw and resolved to\nconquer. He roused himself from these deep musings to look once more\nat his new idol, turned his head, and saw that he was alone; he had\nheard a faint rustling sound, the door closed--Madame d'Espard had\ntaken her cousin with her. Lucien was surprised to the last degree by\nthe sudden desertion; he did not think long about it, however, simply\nbecause it was inexplicable.\n\nWhen the carriage was rolling along the Rue de Richelieu on the way to\nthe Faubourg Saint-Honore, the Marquise spoke to her cousin in a tone\nof suppressed irritation.\n\n\"My dear child, what are you thinking about? Pray wait till an\napothecary's son has made a name for himself before you trouble\nyourself about him. The Duchesse de Chaulieu does not acknowledge\nCanalis even now, and he is famous and a man of good family. This\nyoung fellow is neither your son nor your lover, I suppose?\" added the\nhaughty dame, with a keen, inquisitive glance at her cousin.\n\n\"How fortunate for me that I kept the little scapegrace at a\ndistance!\" thought Madame de Bargeton.\n\n\"Very well,\" continued the Marquise, taking the expression in her\ncousin's eyes for an answer, \"drop him, I beg of you. Taking an\nillustrious name in that way!--Why, it is a piece of impudence that\nwill meet with its desserts in society. It is his mother's name, I\ndare say; but just remember, dear, that the King alone can confer, by\na special ordinance, the title of de Rubempre on the son of a daughter\nof the house. If she made a _mesalliance_, the favor would be enormous,\nonly to be granted to vast wealth, or conspicuous services, or very\npowerful influence. The young man looks like a shopman in his Sunday\nsuit; evidently he is neither wealthy nor noble; he has a fine head,\nbut he seems to me to be very silly; he has no idea what to do, and\nhas nothing to say for himself; in fact, he has no breeding. How came\nyou to take him up?\"\n\nMme. de Bargeton renounced Lucien as Lucien himself had renounced her;\na ghastly fear lest her cousin should learn the manner of her journey\nshot through her mind.\n\n\"Dear cousin, I am in despair that I have compromised you.\"\n\n\"People do not compromise me,\" Mme. d'Espard said, smiling; \"I am only\nthinking of you.\"\n\n\"But you have asked him to dine with you on Monday.\"\n\n\"I shall be ill,\" the Marquise said quickly; \"you can tell him so, and\nI shall leave orders that he is not to be admitted under either name.\"\n\nDuring the interval Lucien noticed that every one was walking up and\ndown the lobby. He would do the same. In the first place, not one of\nMme. d'Espard's visitors recognized him nor paid any attention to him,\ntheir conduct seemed nothing less than extraordinary to the provincial\npoet; and, secondly, Chatelet, on whom he tried to hang, watched him\nout of the corner of his eye and fought shy of him. Lucien walked to\nand fro, watching the eddying crowd of men, till he felt convinced\nthat his costume was absurd, and he went back to his box, ensconced\nhimself in a corner, and stayed there till the end. At times he\nthought of nothing but the magnificent spectacle of the ballet in the\ngreat Inferno scene in the fifth act; sometimes the sight of the house\nabsorbed him, sometimes his own thoughts; he had seen society in\nParis, and the sight had stirred him to the depths.\n\n\"So this is my kingdom,\" he said to himself; \"this is the world that I\nmust conquer.\"\n\nAs he walked home through the streets he thought over all that had\nbeen said by Mme. d'Espard's courtiers; memory reproducing with\nstrange faithfulness their demeanor, their gestures, their manner of\ncoming and going.\n\nNext day, towards noon, Lucien betook himself to Staub, the great\ntailor of that day. Partly by dint of entreaties, and partly by virtue\nof cash, Lucien succeeded in obtaining a promise that his clothes\nshould be ready in time for the great day. Staub went so far as to\ngive his word that a perfectly elegant coat, a waistcoat, and a pair\nof trousers should be forthcoming. Lucien then ordered linen and\npocket-handkerchiefs, a little outfit, in short, of a linen-draper,\nand a celebrated bootmaker measured him for shoes and boots. He bought\na neat walking cane at Verdier's; he went to Mme. Irlande for gloves\nand shirt studs; in short, he did his best to reach the climax of\ndandyism. When he had satisfied all his fancies, he went to the Rue\nNeuve-de-Luxembourg, and found that Louise had gone out.\n\n\"She was dining with Mme. la Marquise d'Espard,\" her maid said, \"and\nwould not be back till late.\"\n\nLucien dined for two francs at a restaurant in the Palais Royal, and\nwent to bed early. The next day was Sunday. He went to Louise's\nlodging at eleven o'clock. Louise had not yet risen. At two o'clock he\nreturned once more.\n\n\"Madame cannot see anybody yet,\" reported Albertine, \"but she gave me\na line for you.\"\n\n\"Cannot see anybody yet?\" repeated Lucien. \"But I am not anybody----\"\n\n\"I do not know,\" Albertine answered very impertinently; and Lucien,\nless surprised by Albertine's answer than by a note from Mme. de\nBargeton, took the billet, and read the following discouraging\nlines:--\n\n\n\"Mme. d'Espard is not well; she will not be able to see you on Monday.\nI am not feeling very well myself, but I am about to dress and go to\nkeep her company. I am in despair over this little disappointment; but\nyour talents reassure me, you will make your way without\ncharlatanism.\"\n\n\n\"And no signature!\" Lucien said to himself. He found himself in the\nTuileries before he knew whither he was walking.\n\nWith the gift of second-sight which accompanies genius, he began to\nsuspect that the chilly note was but a warning of the catastrophe to\ncome. Lost in thought, he walked on and on, gazing at the monuments in\nthe Place Louis Quinze.\n\nIt was a sunny day; a stream of fine carriages went past him on the\nway to the Champs Elysees. Following the direction of the crowd of\nstrollers, he saw the three or four thousand carriages that turn the\nChamps Elysees into an improvised Longchamp on Sunday afternoons in\nsummer. The splendid horses, the toilettes, and liveries bewildered\nhim; he went further and further, until he reached the Arc de\nTriomphe, then unfinished. What were his feelings when, as he\nreturned, he saw Mme. de Bargeton and Mme. d'Espard coming towards him\nin a wonderfully appointed caleche, with a chasseur behind it in\nwaving plumes and that gold-embroidered green uniform which he knew\nonly too well. There was a block somewhere in the row, and the\ncarriages waited. Lucien beheld Louise transformed beyond recognition.\nAll the colors of her toilette had been carefully subordinated to her\ncomplexion; her dress was delicious, her hair gracefully and\nbecomingly arranged, her hat, in exquisite taste, was remarkable even\nbeside Mme. d'Espard, that leader of fashion.\n\nThere is something in the art of wearing a hat that escapes\ndefinition. Tilted too far to the back of the head, it imparts a bold\nexpression to the face; bring it too far forward, it gives you a\nsinister look; tipped to one side, it has a jaunty air; a well-dressed\nwoman wears her hat exactly as she means to wear it, and exactly at\nthe right angle. Mme. de Bargeton had solved this curious problem at\nsight. A dainty girdle outlined her slender waist. She had adopted her\ncousin's gestures and tricks of manner; and now, as she sat by Mme.\nd'Espard's side, she played with a tiny scent bottle that dangled by a\nslender gold chain from one of her fingers, displayed a little\nwell-gloved hand without seeming to do so. She had modeled herself on\nMme. d'Espard without mimicking her; the Marquise had found a cousin\nworthy of her, and seemed to be proud of her pupil.\n\nThe men and women on the footways all gazed at the splendid carriage,\nwith the bearings of the d'Espards and Blamont-Chauvrys upon the\npanels. Lucien was amazed at the number of greetings received by the\ncousins; he did not know that the \"all Paris,\" which consists in some\nscore of salons, was well aware already of the relationship between\nthe ladies. A little group of young men on horseback accompanied the\ncarriage in the Bois; Lucien could recognize de Marsay and Rastignac\namong them, and could see from their gestures that the pair of\ncoxcombs were complimenting Mme. de Bargeton upon her transformation.\nMme. d'Espard was radiant with health and grace. So her indisposition\nwas simply a pretext for ridding herself of him, for there had been no\nmention of another day!\n\nThe wrathful poet went towards the caleche; he walked slowly, waited\ntill he came in full sight of the two ladies, and made them a bow.\nMme. de Bargeton would not see him; but the Marquise put up her\neyeglass, and deliberately cut him. He had been disowned by the\nsovereign lords of Angouleme, but to be disowned by society in Paris\nwas another thing; the booby-squires by doing their utmost to mortify\nLucien admitted his power and acknowledged him as a man; for Mme.\nd'Espard he had positively no existence. This was a sentence, it was a\nrefusal of justice. Poor poet! a deadly cold seized on him when he saw\nde Marsay eying him through his glass; and when the Parisian lion let\nthat optical instrument fall, it dropped in so singular a fashion that\nLucien thought of the knife-blade of the guillotine.\n\nThe caleche went by. Rage and a craving for vengeance took possession\nof his slighted soul. If Mme. de Bargeton had been in his power, he\ncould have cut her throat at that moment; he was a Fouquier-Tinville\ngloating over the pleasure of sending Mme. d'Espard to the scaffold.\nIf only he could have put de Marsay to the torture with refinements of\nsavage cruelty! Canalis went by on horseback, bowing to the prettiest\nwomen, his dress elegant, as became the most dainty of poets.\n\n\"Great heavens!\" exclaimed Lucien. \"Money, money at all costs! money\nis the one power before which the world bends the knee.\" (\"No!\" cried\nconscience, \"not money, but glory; and glory means work! Work! that\nwas what David said.\") \"Great heavens! what am I doing here? But I\nwill triumph. I will drive along this avenue in a caleche with a\nchasseur behind me! I will possess a Marquise d'Espard.\" And flinging\nout the wrathful words, he went to Hurbain's to dine for two francs.\n\nNext morning, at nine o'clock, he went to the Rue Neuve-de-Luxembourg\nto upbraid Louise for her barbarity. But Mme. de Bargeton was not at\nhome to him, and not only so, but the porter would not allow him to go\nup to her rooms; so he stayed outside in the street, watching the\nhouse till noon. At twelve o'clock Chatelet came out, looked at Lucien\nout of the corner of his eye, and avoided him.\n\nStung to the quick, Lucien hurried after his rival; and Chatelet,\nfinding himself closely pursued, turned and bowed, evidently intending\nto shake him off by this courtesy.\n\n\"Spare me just a moment for pity's sake, sir,\" said Lucien; \"I want\njust a word or two with you. You have shown me friendship, I now ask\nthe most trifling service of that friendship. You have just come from\nMme. de Bargeton; how have I fallen into disgrace with her and Mme.\nd'Espard?--please explain.\"\n\n\"M. Chardon, do you know why the ladies left you at the Opera that\nevening?\" asked Chatelet, with treacherous good-nature.\n\n\"No,\" said the poor poet.\n\n\"Well, it was M. de Rastignac who spoke against you from the\nbeginning. They asked him about you, and the young dandy simply said\nthat your name was Chardon, and not de Rubempre; that your mother was\na monthly nurse; that your father, when he was alive, was an\napothecary in L'Houmeau, a suburb of Angouleme; and that your sister,\na charming girl, gets up shirts to admiration, and is just about to be\nmarried to a local printer named Sechard. Such is the world! You no\nsooner show yourself than it pulls you to pieces.\n\n\"M. de Marsay came to Mme. d'Espard to laugh at you with her; so the\ntwo ladies, thinking that your presence put them in a false position,\nwent out at once. Do not attempt to go to either house. If Mme. de\nBargeton continued to receive your visits, her cousin would have\nnothing to do with her. You have genius; try to avenge yourself. The\nworld looks down upon you; look down in your turn upon the world. Take\nrefuge in some garret, write your masterpieces, seize on power of any\nkind, and you will see the world at your feet. Then you can give back\nthe bruises which you have received, and in the very place where they\nwere given. Mme. de Bargeton will be the more distant now because she\nhas been friendly. That is the way with women. But the question now\nfor you is not how to win back Anais' friendship, but how to avoid\nmaking an enemy of her. I will tell you of a way. She has written\nletters to you; send all her letters back to her, she will be sensible\nthat you are acting like a gentleman; and at a later time, if you\nshould need her, she will not be hostile. For my own part, I have so\nhigh an opinion of your future, that I have taken your part\neverywhere; and if I can do anything here for you, you will always\nfind me ready to be of use.\"\n\nThe elderly beau seemed to have grown young again in the atmosphere of\nParis. He bowed with frigid politeness; but Lucien, woe-begone,\nhaggard, and undone, forgot to return the salutation. He went back to\nhis inn, and there found the great Staub himself, come in person, not\nso much to try his customer's clothes as to make inquiries of the\nlandlady with regard to that customer's financial status. The report\nhad been satisfactory. Lucien had traveled post; Mme. de Bargeton\nbrought him back from Vaudeville last Thursday in her carriage. Staub\naddressed Lucien as \"Monsieur le Comte,\" and called his customer's\nattention to the artistic skill with which he had brought a charming\nfigure into relief.\n\n\"A young man in such a costume has only to walk in the Tuileries,\" he\nsaid, \"and he will marry an English heiress within a fortnight.\"\n\nLucien brightened a little under the influences of the German tailor's\njoke, the perfect fit of his new clothes, the fine cloth, and the\nsight of a graceful figure which met his eyes in the looking-glass.\nVaguely he told himself that Paris was the capital of chance, and for\nthe moment he believed in chance. Had he not a volume of poems and a\nmagnificent romance entitled _The Archer of Charles IX._ in manuscript?\nHe had hope for the future. Staub promised the overcoat and the rest\nof the clothes the next day.\n\nThe next day the bootmaker, linen-draper, and tailor all returned\narmed each with his bill, which Lucien, still under the charm of\nprovincial habits, paid forthwith, not knowing how otherwise to rid\nhimself of them. After he had paid, there remained but three hundred\nand sixty francs out of the two thousand which he had brought with him\nfrom Angouleme, and he had been but one week in Paris! Nevertheless,\nhe dressed and went to take a stroll in the Terrassee des Feuillants.\nHe had his day of triumph. He looked so handsome and so graceful, he\nwas so well dressed, that women looked at him; two or three were so\nmuch struck with his beauty, that they turned their heads to look\nagain. Lucien studied the gait and carriage of the young men on the\nTerrasse, and took a lesson in fine manners while he meditated on his\nthree hundred and sixty francs.\n\nThat evening, alone in his chamber, an idea occurred to him which\nthrew a light on the problem of his existence at the Gaillard-Bois,\nwhere he lived on the plainest fare, thinking to economize in this\nway. He asked for his account, as if he meant to leave, and discovered\nthat he was indebted to his landlord to the extent of a hundred\nfrancs. The next morning was spent in running around the Latin\nQuarter, recommended for its cheapness by David. For a long while he\nlooked about till, finally, in the Rue de Cluny, close to the\nSorbonne, he discovered a place where he could have a furnished room\nfor such a price as he could afford to pay. He settled with his\nhostess of the Gaillard-Bois, and took up his quarters in the Rue de\nCluny that same day. His removal only cost him the cab fare.\n\nWhen he had taken possession of his poor room, he made a packet of\nMme. de Bargeton's letters, laid them on the table, and sat down to\nwrite to her; but before he wrote he fell to thinking over that fatal\nweek. He did not tell himself that he had been the first to be\nfaithless; that for a sudden fancy he had been ready to leave his\nLouise without knowing what would become of her in Paris. He saw none\nof his own shortcomings, but he saw his present position, and blamed\nMme. de Bargeton for it. She was to have lighted his way; instead she\nhad ruined him. He grew indignant, he grew proud, he worked himself\ninto a paroxysm of rage, and set himself to compose the following\nepistle:--\n\n\n  \"What would you think, madame, of a woman who should take a fancy\n  to some poor and timid child full of the noble superstitions which\n  the grown man calls 'illusions;' and using all the charms of\n  woman's coquetry, all her most delicate ingenuity, should feign a\n  mother's love to lead that child astray? Her fondest promises, the\n  card-castles which raised his wonder, cost her nothing; she leads\n  him on, tightens her hold upon him, sometimes coaxing, sometimes\n  scolding him for his want of confidence, till the child leaves his\n  home and follows her blindly to the shores of a vast sea. Smiling,\n  she lures him into a frail skiff, and sends him forth alone and\n  helpless to face the storm. Standing safe on the rock, she laughs\n  and wishes him luck. You are that woman; I am that child.\n\n  \"The child has a keepsake in his hands, something which might\n  betray the wrongs done by your beneficence, your kindness in\n  deserting him. You might have to blush if you saw him struggling\n  for life, and chanced to recollect that once you clasped him to\n  your breast. When you read these words the keepsake will be in\n  your own safe keeping; you are free to forget everything.\n\n  \"Once you pointed out fair hopes to me in the skies, I awake to\n  find reality in the squalid poverty of Paris. While you pass, and\n  others bow before you, on your brilliant path in the great world,\n  I, I whom you deserted on the threshold, shall be shivering in the\n  wretched garret to which you consigned me. Yet some pang may\n  perhaps trouble your mind amid festivals and pleasures; you may\n  think sometimes of the child whom you thrust into the depths. If\n  so, madame, think of him without remorse. Out of the depths of his\n  misery the child offers you the one thing left to him--his\n  forgiveness in a last look. Yes, madame, thanks to you, I have\n  nothing left. Nothing! was not the world created from nothing?\n  Genius should follow the Divine example; I begin with God-like\n  forgiveness, but as yet I know not whether I possess the God-like\n  power. You need only tremble lest I should go astray; for you\n  would be answerable for my sins. Alas! I pity you, for you will\n  have no part in the future towards which I go, with work as my\n  guide.\"\n\n\nAfter penning this rhetorical effusion, full of the sombre dignity\nwhich an artist of one-and-twenty is rather apt to overdo, Lucien's\nthoughts went back to them at home. He saw the pretty rooms which\nDavid had furnished for him, at the cost of part of his little store,\nand a vision rose before him of quiet, simple pleasures in the past.\nShadowy figures came about him; he saw his mother and Eve and David,\nand heard their sobs over his leave-taking, and at that he began to\ncry himself, for he felt very lonely in Paris, and friendless and\nforlorn.\n\nTwo or three days later he wrote to his sister:--\n\n\n  \"MY DEAR EVE,--When a sister shares the life of a brother who\n  devotes himself to art, it is her sad privilege to take more\n  sorrow than joy into her life; and I am beginning to fear that I\n  shall be a great trouble to you. Have I not abused your goodness\n  already? have not all of you sacrificed yourselves to me? It is\n  the memory of the past, so full of family happiness, that helps me\n  to bear up in my present loneliness. Now that I have tasted the\n  first beginnings of poverty and the treachery of the world of\n  Paris, how my thoughts have flown to you, swift as an eagle back\n  to its eyrie, so that I might be with true affection again. Did\n  you see sparks in the candle? Did a coal pop out of the fire? Did\n  you hear singing in your ears? And did mother say, 'Lucien is\n  thinking of us,' and David answer, 'He is fighting his way in the\n  world?'\n\n  \"My Eve, I am writing this letter for your eyes only. I cannot\n  tell any one else all that has happened to me, good and bad,\n  blushing for both, as I write, for good here is as rare as evil\n  ought to be. You shall have a great piece of news in a very few\n  words. Mme. de Bargeton was ashamed of me, disowned me, would not\n  see me, and gave me up nine days after we came to Paris. She saw\n  me in the street and looked another way; when, simply to follow\n  her into the society to which she meant to introduce me, I had\n  spent seventeen hundred and sixty francs out of the two thousand I\n  brought from Angouleme, the money so hardly scraped together. 'How\n  did you spend it?' you will ask. Paris is a strange bottomless\n  gulf, my poor sister; you can dine here for less than a franc, yet\n  the simplest dinner at a fashionable restaurant costs fifty\n  francs; there are waistcoats and trousers to be had for four\n  francs and two francs each; but a fashionable tailor never charges\n  less than a hundred francs. You pay for everything; you pay a\n  halfpenny to cross the kennel in the street when it rains; you\n  cannot go the least little way in a cab for less than thirty-two\n  sous.\n\n  \"I have been staying in one of the best parts of Paris, but now I\n  am living at the Hotel de Cluny, in the Rue de Cluny, one of the\n  poorest and darkest slums, shut in between three churches and the\n  old buildings of the Sorbonne. I have a furnished room on the\n  fourth floor; it is very bare and very dirty, but, all the same, I\n  pay fifteen francs a month for it. For breakfast I spend a penny\n  on a roll and a halfpenny for milk, but I dine very decently for\n  twenty-two sous at a restaurant kept by a man named Flicoteaux in\n  the Place de la Sorbonne itself. My expenses every month will not\n  exceed sixty francs, everything included, until the winter begins\n  --at least I hope not. So my two hundred and forty francs ought to\n  last me for the first four months. Between now and then I shall\n  have sold _The Archer of Charles IX._ and the _Marguerites_ no doubt.\n  Do not be in the least uneasy on my account. If the present is\n  cold and bare and poverty-stricken, the blue distant future is\n  rich and splendid; most great men have known the vicissitudes\n  which depress but cannot overwhelm me.\n\n  \"Plautus, the great comic Latin poet, was once a miller's lad.\n  Machiavelli wrote _The Prince_ at night, and by day was a common\n  working-man like any one else; and more than all, the great\n  Cervantes, who lost an arm at the battle of Lepanto, and helped to\n  win that famous day, was called a 'base-born, handless dotard' by\n  the scribblers of his day; there was an interval of ten years\n  between the appearance of the first part and the second of his\n  sublime _Don Quixote_ for lack of a publisher. Things are not so bad\n  as that nowadays. Mortifications and want only fall to the lot of\n  unknown writers; as soon as a man's name is known, he grows rich,\n  and I will be rich. And besides, I live within myself, I spend\n  half the day at the Bibliotheque Sainte-Genevieve, learning all\n  that I want to learn; I should not go far unless I knew more than\n  I do. So at this moment I am almost happy. In a few days I have\n  fallen in with my life very gladly. I begin the work that I love\n  with daylight, my subsistence is secure, I think a great deal, and\n  I study. I do not see that I am open to attack at any point, now\n  that I have renounced a world where my vanity might suffer at any\n  moment. The great men of every age are obliged to lead lives\n  apart. What are they but birds in the forest? They sing, nature\n  falls under the spell of their song, and no one should see them.\n  That shall be my lot, always supposing that I can carry out my\n  ambitious plans.\n\n  \"Mme. de Bargeton I do not regret. A woman who could behave as she\n  behaved does not deserve a thought. Nor am I sorry that I left\n  Angouleme. She did wisely when she flung me into the sea of Paris\n  to sink or swim. This is the place for men of letters and thinkers\n  and poets; here you cultivate glory, and I know how fair the\n  harvest is that we reap in these days. Nowhere else can a writer\n  find the living works of the great dead, the works of art which\n  quicken the imagination in the galleries and museums here; nowhere\n  else will you find great reference libraries always open in which\n  the intellect may find pasture. And lastly, here in Paris there is\n  a spirit which you breathe in the air; it infuses the least\n  details, every literary creation bears traces of its influence.\n  You learn more by talk in a cafe, or at a theatre, in one half\n  hour, than you would learn in ten years in the provinces. Here, in\n  truth, wherever you go, there is always something to see,\n  something to learn, some comparison to make. Extreme cheapness and\n  excessive dearness--there is Paris for you; there is honeycomb\n  here for every bee, every nature finds its own nourishment. So,\n  though life is hard for me just now, I repent of nothing. On the\n  contrary, a fair future spreads out before me, and my heart\n  rejoices though it is saddened for the moment. Good-bye my dear\n  sister. Do not expect letters from me regularly; it is one of the\n  peculiarities of Paris that one really does not know how the time\n  goes. Life is so alarmingly rapid. I kiss the mother and you and\n  David more tenderly than ever.\n\n\"LUCIEN.\"\n\n\nThe name of Flicoteaux is engraved on many memories. Few indeed were\nthe students who lived in the Latin Quarter during the last twelve\nyears of the Restoration and did not frequent that temple sacred to\nhunger and impecuniosity. There a dinner of three courses, with a\nquarter bottle of wine or a bottle of beer, could be had for eighteen\nsous; or for twenty-two sous the quarter bottle becomes a bottle.\nFlicoteaux, that friend of youth, would beyond a doubt have amassed a\ncolossal fortune but for a line on his bill of fare, a line which\nrival establishments are wont to print in capital letters, thus--BREAD\nAT DISCRETION, which, being interpreted, should read \"indiscretion.\"\n\nFlicoteaux has been nursing-father to many an illustrious name.\nVerily, the heart of more than one great man ought to wax warm with\ninnumerable recollections of inexpressible enjoyment at the sight of\nthe small, square window panes that look upon the Place de la\nSorbonne, and the Rue Neuve-de-Richelieu. Flicoteaux II. and\nFlicoteaux III. respected the old exterior, maintaining the dingy hue\nand general air of a respectable, old-established house, showing\nthereby the depth of their contempt for the charlatanism of the\nshop-front, the kind of advertisement which feasts the eyes at the\nexpense of the stomach, to which your modern restaurant almost always\nhas recourse. Here you beheld no piles of straw-stuffed game never\ndestined to make the acquaintance of the spit, no fantastical fish to\njustify the mountebank's remark, \"I saw a fine carp to-day; I expect\nto buy it this day week.\" Instead of the prime vegetables more\nfittingly described by the word primeval, artfully displayed in the\nwindow for the delectation of the military man and his fellow\ncountry-woman the nursemaid, honest Flicoteaux exhibited full\nsalad-bowls adorned with many a rivet, or pyramids of stewed prunes to\nrejoice the sight of the customer, and assure him that the word\n\"dessert,\" with which other handbills made too free, was in this case\nno charter to hoodwink the public. Loaves of six pounds' weight, cut\nin four quarters, made good the promise of \"bread at discretion.\" Such\nwas the plenty of the establishment, that Moliere would have celebrated\nit if it had been in existence in his day, so comically appropriate is\nthe name.\n\nFlicoteaux still subsists; so long as students are minded to live,\nFlicoteaux will make a living. You feed there, neither more nor less;\nand you feed as you work, with morose or cheerful industry, according\nto the circumstances and the temperament.\n\nAt that time his well-known establishment consisted of two\ndining-halls, at right angles to each other; long, narrow, low-ceiled\nrooms, looking respectively on the Rue Neuve-de-Richelieu and the Place\nde la Sorbonne. The furniture must have come originally from the\nrefectory of some abbey, for there was a monastic look about the\nlengthy tables, where the serviettes of regular customers, each thrust\nthrough a numbered ring of crystallized tin plate, were laid by their\nplaces. Flicoteaux I. only changed the serviettes of a Sunday; but\nFlicoteaux II. changed them twice a week, it is said, under pressure of\ncompetition which threatened his dynasty.\n\nFlicoteaux's restaurant is no banqueting-hall, with its refinements\nand luxuries; it is a workshop where suitable tools are provided, and\neverybody gets up and goes as soon as he has finished. The coming and\ngoing within are swift. There is no dawdling among the waiters; they\nare all busy; every one of them is wanted.\n\nThe fare is not very varied. The potato is a permanent institution;\nthere might not be a single tuber left in Ireland, and prevailing\ndearth elsewhere, but you would still find potatoes at Flicoteaux's.\nNot once in thirty years shall you miss its pale gold (the color\nbeloved of Titian), sprinkled with chopped verdure; the potato enjoys\na privilege that women might envy; such as you see it in 1814, so\nshall you find it in 1840. Mutton cutlets and fillet of beef at\nFlicoteaux's represent black game and fillet of sturgeon at Very's;\nthey are not on the regular bill of fare, that is, and must be ordered\nbeforehand. Beef of the feminine gender there prevails; the young of\nthe bovine species appears in all kinds of ingenious disguises. When\nthe whiting and mackerel abound on our shores, they are likewise seen\nin large numbers at Flicoteaux's; his whole establishment, indeed, is\ndirectly affected by the caprices of the season and the vicissitudes\nof French agriculture. By eating your dinners at Flicoteaux's you\nlearn a host of things of which the wealthy, the idle, and folk\nindifferent to the phases of Nature have no suspicion, and the student\npenned up in the Latin Quarter is kept accurately informed of the\nstate of the weather and good or bad seasons. He knows when it is a\ngood year for peas or French beans, and the kind of salad stuff that\nis plentiful; when the Great Market is glutted with cabbages, he is at\nonce aware of the fact, and the failure of the beetroot crop is\nbrought home to his mind. A slander, old in circulation in Lucien's\ntime, connected the appearance of beef-steaks with a mortality among\nhorseflesh.\n\nFew Parisian restaurants are so well worth seeing. Every one at\nFlicoteaux's is young; you see nothing but youth; and although earnest\nfaces and grave, gloomy, anxious faces are not lacking, you see hope\nand confidence and poverty gaily endured. Dress, as a rule, is\ncareless, and regular comers in decent clothes are marked exceptions.\nEverybody knows at once that something extraordinary is afoot: a\nmistress to visit, a theatre party, or some excursion into higher\nspheres. Here, it is said, friendships have been made among students\nwho became famous men in after days, as will be seen in the course of\nthis narrative; but with the exception of a few knots of young fellows\nfrom the same part of France who make a group about the end of a\ntable, the gravity of the diners is hardly relaxed. Perhaps this\ngravity is due to the catholicity of the wine, which checks good\nfellowship of any kind.\n\nFlicoteaux's frequenters may recollect certain sombre and mysterious\nfigures enveloped in the gloom of the chilliest penury; these beings\nwould dine there daily for a couple of years and then vanish, and the\nmost inquisitive regular comer could throw no light on the\ndisappearance of such goblins of Paris. Friendships struck up over\nFlicoteaux's dinners were sealed in neighboring cafes in the flames of\nheady punch, or by the generous warmth of a small cup of black coffee\nglorified by a dash of something hotter and stronger.\n\nLucien, like all neophytes, was modest and regular in his habits in\nthose early days at the Hotel de Cluny. After the first unlucky\nventure in fashionable life which absorbed his capital, he threw\nhimself into his work with the first earnest enthusiasm, which is\nfrittered away so soon over the difficulties or in the by-paths of\nevery life in Paris. The most luxurious and the very poorest lives are\nequally beset with temptations which nothing but the fierce energy of\ngenius or the morose persistence of ambition can overcome.\n\nLucien used to drop in at Flicoteaux's about half-past four, having\nremarked the advantages of an early arrival; the bill-of-fare was more\nvaried, and there was still some chance of obtaining the dish of your\nchoice. Like all imaginative persons, he had taken a fancy to a\nparticular seat, and showed discrimination in his selection. On the\nvery first day he had noticed a table near the counter, and from the\nfaces of those who sat about it, and chance snatches of their talk, he\nrecognized brothers of the craft. A sort of instinct, moreover,\npointed out the table near the counter as a spot whence he could\nparlay with the owners of the restaurant. In time an acquaintance\nwould grow up, he thought, and then in the day of distress he could no\ndoubt obtain the necessary credit. So he took his place at a small\nsquare table close to the desk, intended probably for casual comers,\nfor the two clean serviettes were unadorned with rings. Lucien's\nopposite neighbor was a thin, pallid youth, to all appearance as poor\nas himself; his handsome face was somewhat worn, already it told of\nhopes that had vanished, leaving lines upon his forehead and barren\nfurrows in his soul, where seeds had been sown that had come to\nnothing. Lucien felt drawn to the stranger by these tokens; his\nsympathies went out to him with irresistible fervor.\n\nAfter a week's exchange of small courtesies and remarks, the poet from\nAngouleme found the first person with whom he could chat. The\nstranger's name was Etienne Lousteau. Two years ago he had left his\nnative place, a town in Berri, just as Lucien had come from Angouleme.\nHis lively gestures, bright eyes, and occasionally curt speech\nrevealed a bitter apprenticeship to literature. Etienne had come from\nSancerre with his tragedy in his pocket, drawn to Paris by the same\nmotives that impelled Lucien--hope of fame and power and money.\n\nSometimes Etienne Lousteau came for several days together; but in a\nlittle while his visits became few and far between, and he would stay\naway for five or six days in succession. Then he would come back, and\nLucien would hope to see his poet next day, only to find a stranger in\nhis place. When two young men meet daily, their talk harks back to\ntheir last conversation; but these continual interruptions obliged\nLucien to break the ice afresh each time, and further checked an\nintimacy which made little progress during the first few weeks. On\ninquiry of the damsel at the counter, Lucien was told that his future\nfriend was on the staff of a small newspaper, and wrote reviews of\nbooks and dramatic criticism of pieces played at the Ambigu-Comique,\nthe Gaite, and the Panorama-Dramatique. The young man became a\npersonage all at once in Lucien's eyes. Now, he thought, he would lead\nthe conversation on rather more personal topics, and make some effort\nto gain a friend so likely to be useful to a beginner. The journalist\nstayed away for a fortnight. Lucien did not know that Etienne only\ndined at Flicoteaux's when he was hard up, and hence his gloomy air of\ndisenchantment and the chilly manner, which Lucien met with gracious\nsmiles and amiable remarks. But, after all, the project of a\nfriendship called for mature deliberation. This obscure journalist\nappeared to lead an expensive life in which _petits verres_, cups of\ncoffee, punch-bowls, sight-seeing, and suppers played a part. In the\nearly days of Lucien's life in the Latin Quarter, he behaved like a\npoor child bewildered by his first experience of Paris life; so that\nwhen he had made a study of prices and weighed his purse, he lacked\ncourage to make advances to Etienne; he was afraid of beginning a\nfresh series of blunders of which he was still repenting. And he was\nstill under the yoke of provincial creeds; his two guardian angels,\nEve and David, rose up before him at the least approach of an evil\nthought, putting him in mind of all the hopes that were centered on\nhim, of the happiness that he owed to the old mother, of all the\npromises of his genius.\n\nHe spent his mornings in studying history at the Bibliotheque\nSainte-Genevieve. His very first researches made him aware of frightful\nerrors in the memoirs of _The Archer of Charles IX._ When the library\nclosed, he went back to his damp, chilly room to correct his work,\ncutting out whole chapters and piecing it together anew. And after\ndining at Flicoteaux's, he went down to the Passage du Commerce to see\nthe newspapers at Blosse's reading-room, as well as new books and\nmagazines and poetry, so as to keep himself informed of the movements\nof the day. And when, towards midnight, he returned to his wretched\nlodgings, he had used neither fuel nor candle-light. His reading in\nthose days made such an enormous change in his ideas, that he revised\nthe volume of flower-sonnets, his beloved _Marguerites_, working them\nover to such purpose, that scarce a hundred lines of the original\nverses were allowed to stand.\n\nSo in the beginning Lucien led the honest, innocent life of the\ncountry lad who never leaves the Latin Quarter; devoting himself\nwholly to his work, with thoughts of the future always before him; who\nfinds Flicoteaux's ordinary luxurious after the simple home-fare; and\nstrolls for recreation along the alleys of the Luxembourg, the blood\nsurging back to his heart as he gives timid side glances to the pretty\nwomen. But this could not last. Lucien, with his poetic temperament\nand boundless longings, could not withstand the temptations held out\nby the play-bills.\n\nThe Theatre-Francais, the Vaudeville, the Varietes, the Opera-Comique\nrelieved him of some sixty francs, although he always went to the pit.\nWhat student could deny himself the pleasure of seeing Talma in one of\nhis famous roles? Lucien was fascinated by the theatre, that first\nlove of all poetic temperaments; the actors and actresses were\nawe-inspiring creatures; he did not so much as dream of the possibility\nof crossing the footlights and meeting them on familiar terms. The men\nand women who gave him so much pleasure were surely marvelous beings,\nwhom the newspapers treated with as much gravity as matters of\nnational interest. To be a dramatic author, to have a play produced on\nthe stage! What a dream was this to cherish! A dream which a few bold\nspirits like Casimir Delavigne had actually realized. Thick swarming\nthoughts like these, and moments of belief in himself, followed by\ndespair gave Lucien no rest, and kept him in the narrow way of toil\nand frugality, in spite of the smothered grumblings of more than one\nfrenzied desire.\n\nCarrying prudence to an extreme, he made it a rule never to enter the\nprecincts of the Palais Royal, that place of perdition where he had\nspent fifty francs at Very's in a single day, and nearly five hundred\nfrancs on his clothes; and when he yielded to temptation, and saw\nFleury, Talma, the two Baptistes, or Michot, he went no further than\nthe murky passage where theatre-goers used to stand in a string from\nhalf-past five in the afternoon till the hour when the doors opened,\nand belated comers were compelled to pay ten sous for a place near the\nticket-office. And after waiting for two hours, the cry of \"All\ntickets are sold!\" rang not unfrequently in the ears of disappointed\nstudents. When the play was over, Lucien went home with downcast eyes,\nthrough streets lined with living attractions, and perhaps fell in\nwith one of those commonplace adventures which loom so large in a\nyoung and timorous imagination.\n\nOne day Lucien counted over his remaining stock of money, and took\nalarm at the melting of his funds; a cold perspiration broke out upon\nhim when he thought that the time had come when he must find a\npublisher, and try also to find work for which a publisher would pay\nhim. The young journalist, with whom he had made a one-sided\nfriendship, never came now to Flicoteaux's. Lucien was waiting for a\nchance--which failed to present itself. In Paris there are no chances\nexcept for men with a very wide circle of acquaintance; chances of\nsuccess of every kind increase with the number of your connections;\nand, therefore, in this sense also the chances are in favor of the big\nbattalions. Lucien had sufficient provincial foresight still left, and\nhad no mind to wait until only a last few coins remained to him. He\nresolved to face the publishers.\n\nSo one tolerably chilly September morning Lucien went down the Rue de\nla Harpe, with his two manuscripts under his arm. As he made his way\nto the Quai des Augustins, and went along, looking into the\nbooksellers' windows on one side and into the Seine on the other, his\ngood genius might have counseled him to pitch himself into the water\nsooner than plunge into literature. After heart-searching hesitations,\nafter a profound scrutiny of the various countenances, more or less\nencouraging, soft-hearted, churlish, cheerful, or melancholy, to be\nseen through the window panes, or in the doorways of the booksellers'\nestablishments, he espied a house where the shopmen were busy packing\nbooks at a great rate. Goods were being despatched. The walls were\nplastered with bills:\n\n\n                      JUST OUT.\n\n     LE SOLITAIRE, by M. le Vicomte d'Arlincourt.\n         Third edition.\n     LEONIDE, by Victor Ducange; five volumes\n         12mo, printed on fine paper. 12 francs.\n     INDUCTIONS MORALES, by Keratry.\n\n\n\"They are lucky, that they are!\" exclaimed Lucien.\n\nThe placard, a new and original idea of the celebrated Ladvocat, was\njust beginning to blossom out upon the walls. In no long space Paris\nwas to wear motley, thanks to the exertions of his imitators, and the\nTreasury was to discover a new source of revenue.\n\nAnxiety sent the blood surging to Lucien's heart, as he who had been\nso great at Angouleme, so insignificant of late in Paris, slipped past\nthe other houses, summoned up all his courage, and at last entered the\nshop thronged with assistants, customers, and booksellers--\"And\nauthors too, perhaps!\" thought Lucien.\n\n\"I want to speak with M. Vidal or M. Porchon,\" he said, addressing a\nshopman. He had read the names on the sign-board--VIDAL & PORCHON (it\nran), _French and foreign booksellers' agents_.\n\n\"Both gentlemen are engaged,\" said the man.\n\n\"I will wait.\"\n\nLeft to himself, the poet scrutinized the packages, and amused himself\nfor a couple of hours by scanning the titles of books, looking into\nthem, and reading a page or two here and there. At last, as he stood\nleaning against a window, he heard voices, and suspecting that the\ngreen curtains hid either Vidal or Porchon, he listened to the\nconversation.\n\n\"Will you take five hundred copies of me? If you will, I will let you\nhave them at five francs, and give fourteen to the dozen.\"\n\n\"What does that bring them in at?\"\n\n\"Sixteen sous less.\"\n\n\"Four francs four sous?\" said Vidal or Porchon, whichever it was.\n\n\"Yes,\" said the vendor.\n\n\"Credit your account?\" inquired the purchaser.\n\n\"Old humbug! you would settle with me in eighteen months' time, with\nbills at a twelvemonth.\"\n\n\"No. Settled at once,\" returned Vidal or Porchon.\n\n\"Bills at nine months?\" asked the publisher or author, who evidently\nwas selling his book.\n\n\"No, my dear fellow, twelve months,\" returned one of the firm of\nbooksellers' agents.\n\nThere was a pause.\n\n\"You are simply cutting my throat!\" said the visitor.\n\n\"But in a year's time shall we have placed a hundred copies of\n_Leonide_?\" said the other voice. \"If books went off as fast as the\npublishers would like, we should be millionaires, my good sir; but\nthey don't, they go as the public pleases. There is some one now\nbringing out an edition of Scott's novels at eighteen sous per volume,\nthree livres twelve sous per copy, and you want me to give you more\nfor your stale remainders? No. If you mean me to push this novel of\nyours, you must make it worth my while.--Vidal!\"\n\nA stout man, with a pen behind his ear, came down from his desk.\n\n\"How many copies of Ducange did you place last journey?\" asked Porchon\nof his partner.\n\n\"Two hundred of _Le Petit Vieillard de Calais_, but to sell them I was\nobliged to cry down two books which pay in less commission, and\nuncommonly fine 'nightingales' they are now.\n\n(A \"nightingale,\" as Lucien afterwards learned, is a bookseller's name\nfor books that linger on hand, perched out of sight in the loneliest\nnooks in the shop.)\n\n\"And besides,\" added Vidal, \"Picard is bringing out some novels, as\nyou know. We have been promised twenty per cent on the published price\nto make the thing a success.\"\n\n\"Very well, at twelve months,\" the publisher answered in a piteous\nvoice, thunderstruck by Vidal's confidential remark.\n\n\"Is it an offer?\" Porchon inquired curtly.\n\n\"Yes.\" The stranger went out. After he had gone, Lucien heard Porchon\nsay to Vidal:\n\n\"We have three hundred copies on order now. We will keep him waiting\nfor his settlement, sell the _Leonides_ for five francs net, settlement\nin six months, and----\"\n\n\"And that will be fifteen hundred francs into our pockets,\" said\nVidal.\n\n\"Oh, I saw quite well that he was in a fix. He is giving Ducange four\nthousand francs for two thousand copies.\"\n\nLucien cut Vidal short by appearing in the entrance of the den.\n\n\"I have the honor of wishing you a good day, gentlemen,\" he said,\naddressing both partners. The booksellers nodded slightly.\n\n\"I have a French historical romance after the style of Scott. It is\ncalled _The Archer of Charles IX._; I propose to offer it to you----\"\n\nPorchon glanced at Lucien with lustreless eyes, and laid his pen down\non the desk. Vidal stared rudely at the author.\n\n\"We are not publishing booksellers, sir; we are booksellers' agents,\"\nhe said. \"When we bring out a book ourselves, we only deal in\nwell-known names; and we only take serious literature besides--history\nand epitomes.\"\n\n\"But my book is very serious. It is an attempt to set the struggle\nbetween Catholics and Calvinists in its true light; the Catholics were\nsupporters of absolute monarchy, and the Protestants for a republic.\"\n\n\"M. Vidal!\" shouted an assistant. Vidal fled.\n\n\"I don't say, sir, that your book is not a masterpiece,\" replied\nPorchon, with scanty civility, \"but we only deal in books that are\nready printed. Go and see somebody that buys manuscripts. There is old\nDoguereau in the Rue du Coq, near the Louvre, he is in the romance\nline. If you had only spoken sooner, you might have seen Pollet, a\ncompetitor of Doguereau and of the publisher in the Wooden Galleries.\"\n\n\"I have a volume of poetry----\"\n\n\"M. Porchon!\" somebody shouted.\n\n\"_Poetry_!\" Porchon exclaimed angrily. \"For what do you take me?\" he\nadded, laughing in Lucien's face. And he dived into the regions of the\nback shop.\n\nLucien went back across the Pont Neuf absorbed in reflection. From all\nthat he understood of this mercantile dialect, it appeared that books,\nlike cotton nightcaps, were to be regarded as articles of merchandise\nto be sold dear and bought cheap.\n\n\"I have made a mistake,\" said Lucien to himself; but, all the same,\nthis rough-and-ready practical aspect of literature made an impression\nupon him.\n\nIn the Rue du Coq he stopped in front of a modest-looking shop, which\nhe had passed before. He saw the inscription DOGUEREAU, BOOKSELLER,\npainted above it in yellow letters on a green ground, and remembered\nthat he had seen the name at the foot of the title-page of several\nnovels at Blosse's reading-room. In he went, not without the inward\ntrepidation which a man of any imagination feels at the prospect of a\nbattle. Inside the shop he discovered an odd-looking old man, one of\nthe queer characters of the trade in the days of the Empire.\n\nDoguereau wore a black coat with vast square skirts, when fashion\nrequired swallow-tail coats. His waistcoat was of some cheap material,\na checked pattern of many colors; a steel chain, with a copper key\nattached to it, hung from his fob and dangled down over a roomy pair\nof black nether garments. The booksellers' watch must have been the\nsize of an onion. Iron-gray ribbed stockings, and shoes with silver\nbuckles completed is costume. The old man's head was bare, and\nornamented with a fringe of grizzled locks, quite poetically scanty.\n\"Old Doguereau,\" as Porchon styled him, was dressed half like a\nprofessor of belles-lettres as to his trousers and shoes, half like a\ntradesman with respect to the variegated waistcoat, the stockings, and\nthe watch; and the same odd mixture appeared in the man himself. He\nunited the magisterial, dogmatic air, and the hollow countenance of\nthe professor of rhetoric with the sharp eyes, suspicious mouth, and\nvague uneasiness of the bookseller.\n\n\"M. Doguereau?\" asked Lucien.\n\n\"That is my name, sir.\"\n\n\"You are very young,\" remarked the bookseller.\n\n\"My age, sir, has nothing to do with the matter.\"\n\n\"True,\" and the old bookseller took up the manuscript. \"Ah, begad! _The\nArcher of Charles IX._, a good title. Let us see now, young man, just\ntell me your subject in a word or two.\"\n\n\"It is a historical work, sir, in the style of Scott. The character of\nthe struggle between the Protestants and Catholics is depicted as a\nstruggle between two opposed systems of government, in which the\nthrone is seriously endangered. I have taken the Catholic side.\"\n\n\"Eh! but you have ideas, young man. Very well, I will read your book,\nI promise you. I would rather have had something more in Mrs.\nRadcliffe's style; but if you are industrious, if you have some notion\nof style, conceptions, ideas, and the art of telling a story, I don't\nask better than to be of use to you. What do we want but good\nmanuscripts?\"\n\n\"When can I come back?\"\n\n\"I am going into the country this evening; I shall be back again the\nday after to-morrow. I shall have read your manuscript by that time;\nand if it suits me, we might come to terms that very day.\"\n\nSeeing his acquaintance so easy, Lucien was inspired with the unlucky\nidea of bringing the _Marguerites_ upon the scene.\n\n\"I have a volume of poetry as well, sir----\" he began.\n\n\"Oh! you are a poet! Then I don't want your romance,\" and the old man\nhanded back the manuscript. \"The rhyming fellows come to grief when\nthey try their hands at prose. In prose you can't use words that mean\nnothing; you absolutely must say something.\"\n\n\"But Sir Walter Scott, sir, wrote poetry as well as----\"\n\n\"That is true,\" said Doguereau, relenting. He guessed that the young\nfellow before him was poor, and kept the manuscript. \"Where do you\nlive? I will come and see you.\"\n\nLucien, all unsuspicious of the idea at the back of the old man's\nhead, gave his address; he did not see that he had to do with a\nbookseller of the old school, a survival of the eighteenth century,\nwhen booksellers tried to keep Voltaires and Montesquieus starving in\ngarrets under lock and key.\n\n\"The Latin Quarter. I am coming back that very way,\" said Doguereau,\nwhen he had read the address.\n\n\"Good man!\" thought Lucien, as he took his leave. \"So I have met with\na friend to young authors, a man of taste who knows something. That is\nthe kind of man for me! It is just as I said to David--talent soon\nmakes its way in Paris.\"\n\nLucien went home again happy and light of heart; he dreamed of glory.\nHe gave not another thought to the ominous words which fell on his ear\nas he stood by the counter in Vidal and Porchon's shop; he beheld\nhimself the richer by twelve hundred francs at least. Twelve hundred\nfrancs! It meant a year in Paris, a whole year of preparation for the\nwork that he meant to do. What plans he built on that hope! What sweet\ndreams, what visions of a life established on a basis of work!\nMentally he found new quarters, and settled himself in them; it would\nnot have taken much to set him making a purchase or two. He could only\nstave off impatience by constant reading at Blosse's.\n\nTwo days later old Doguereau come to the lodgings of his budding Sir\nWalter Scott. He was struck with the pains which Lucien had taken with\nthe style of this his first work, delighted with the strong contrasts\nof character sanctioned by the epoch, and surprised at the spirited\nimagination which a young writer always displays in the scheming of a\nfirst plot--he had not been spoiled, thought old Daddy Doguereau. He\nhad made up his mind to give a thousand francs for _The Archer of\nCharles IX._; he would buy the copyright out and out, and bind Lucien\nby an engagement for several books, but when he came to look at the\nhouse, the old fox thought better of it.\n\n\"A young fellow that lives here has none but simple tastes,\" said he\nto himself; \"he is fond of study, fond of work; I need not give more\nthan eight hundred francs.\"\n\n\"Fourth floor,\" answered the landlady, when he asked for M. Lucien de\nRubempre. The old bookseller, peering up, saw nothing but the sky\nabove the fourth floor.\n\n\"This young fellow,\" thought he, \"is a good-looking lad; one might go\nso far as to say that he is very handsome. If he were to make too much\nmoney, he would only fall into dissipated ways, and then he would not\nwork. In the interests of us both, I shall only offer six hundred\nfrancs, in coin though, not paper.\"\n\nHe climbed the stairs and gave three raps at the door. Lucien came to\nopen it. The room was forlorn in its bareness. A bowl of milk and a\npenny roll stood on the table. The destitution of genius made an\nimpression on Daddy Doguereau.\n\n\"Let him preserve these simple habits of life, this frugality, these\nmodest requirements,\" thought he.--Aloud he said: \"It is a pleasure to\nme to see you. Thus, sir, lived Jean-Jacques, whom you resemble in\nmore ways than one. Amid such surroundings the fire of genius shines\nbrightly; good work is done in such rooms as these. This is how men of\nletters should work, instead of living riotously in cafes and\nrestaurants, wasting their time and talent and our money.\"\n\nHe sat down.\n\n\"Your romance is not bad, young man. I was a professor of rhetoric\nonce; I know French history, there are some capital things in it. You\nhave a future before you, in fact.\"\n\n\"Oh! sir.\"\n\n\"No; I tell you so. We may do business together. I will buy your\nromance.\"\n\nLucien's heart swelled and throbbed with gladness. He was about to\nenter the world of literature; he should see himself in print at last.\n\n\"I will give you four hundred francs,\" continued Doguereau in honeyed\naccents, and he looked at Lucien with an air which seemed to betoken\nan effort of generosity.\n\n\"The volume?\" queried Lucien.\n\n\"For the romance,\" said Doguereau, heedless of Lucien's surprise. \"In\nready money,\" he added; \"and you shall undertake to write two books\nfor me every year for six years. If the first book is out of print in\nsix months, I will give you six hundred francs for the others. So, if\nyou write two books each year, you will be making a hundred francs a\nmonth; you will have a sure income, you will be well off. There are\nsome authors whom I only pay three hundred francs for a romance; I\ngive two hundred for translations of English books. Such prices would\nhave been exorbitant in the old days.\"\n\n\"Sir, we cannot possibly come to an understanding. Give me back my\nmanuscript, I beg,\" said Lucien, in a cold chill.\n\n\"Here it is,\" said the old bookseller. \"You know nothing of business,\nsir. Before an author's first book can appear, a publisher is bound to\nsink sixteen hundred francs on the paper and the printing of it. It is\neasier to write a romance than to find all that money. I have a\nhundred romances in manuscript, and I have not a hundred and sixty\nthousand francs in my cash box, alas! I have not made so much in all\nthese twenty years that I have been a bookseller. So you don't make a\nfortune by printing romances, you see. Vidal and Porchon only take\nthem of us on conditions that grow harder and harder day by day. You\nhave only your time to lose, while I am obliged to disburse two\nthousand francs. If we fail, _habent sua fata libelli_, I lose two\nthousand francs; while, as for you, you simply hurl an ode at the\nthick-headed public. When you have thought over this that I have the\nhonor of telling you, you will come back to me.--_You will come back to\nme_!\" he asserted authoritatively, by way of reply to a scornful\ngesture made involuntarily by Lucien. \"So far from finding a publisher\nobliging enough to risk two thousand francs for an unknown writer, you\nwill not find a publisher's clerk that will trouble himself to look\nthrough your screed. Now that I have read it I can point out a good\nmany slips in grammar. You have put _observer_ for _faire observer_ and\n_malgre que_. _Malgre_ is a preposition, and requires an object.\"\n\nLucien appeared to be humiliated.\n\n\"When I see you again, you will have lost a hundred francs,\" he added.\n\"I shall only give a hundred crowns.\"\n\nWith that he rose and took his leave. On the threshold he said, \"If\nyou had not something in you, and a future before you; if I did not\ntake an interest in studious youth, I should not have made you such a\nhandsome offer. A hundred francs per month! Think of it! After all, a\nromance in a drawer is not eating its head off like a horse in a\nstable, nor will it find you in victuals either, and that's a fact.\"\n\nLucien snatched up his manuscript and dashed it on the floor.\n\n\"I would rather burn it, sir!\" he exclaimed.\n\n\"You have a poet's head,\" returned his senior.\n\nLucien devoured his bread and supped his bowl of milk, then he went\ndownstairs. His room was not large enough for him; he was turning\nround and round in it like a lion in a cage at the Jardin des Plantes.\n\nAt the Bibliotheque Saint-Genevieve, whither Lucien was going, he had\ncome to know a stranger by sight; a young man of five-and-twenty or\nthereabouts, working with the sustained industry which nothing can\ndisturb nor distract, the sign by which your genuine literary worker\nis known. Evidently the young man had been reading there for some\ntime, for the librarian and attendants all knew him and paid him\nspecial attention; the librarian would even allow him to take away\nbooks, with which Lucien saw him return in the morning. In the\nstranger student he recognized a brother in penury and hope.\n\nPale-faced and slight and thin, with a fine forehead hidden by masses\nof black, tolerably unkempt hair, there was something about him that\nattracted indifferent eyes: it was a vague resemblance which he bore\nto portraits of the young Bonaparte, engraved from Robert Lefebvre's\npicture. That engraving is a poem of melancholy intensity, of\nsuppressed ambition, of power working below the surface. Study the\nface carefully, and you will discover genius in it and discretion, and\nall the subtlety and greatness of the man. The portrait has speaking\neyes like a woman's; they look out, greedy of space, craving\ndifficulties to vanquish. Even if the name of Bonaparte were not\nwritten beneath it, you would gaze long at that face.\n\nLucien's young student, the incarnation of this picture, usually wore\nfooted trousers, shoes with thick soles to them, an overcoat of coarse\ncloth, a black cravat, a waistcoat of some gray-and-white material\nbuttoned to the chin, and a cheap hat. Contempt for superfluity in\ndress was visible in his whole person. Lucien also discovered that the\nmysterious stranger with that unmistakable stamp which genius sets\nupon the forehead of its slaves was one of Flicoteaux's most regular\ncustomers; he ate to live, careless of the fare which appeared to be\nfamiliar to him, and drank water. Wherever Lucien saw him, at the\nlibrary or at Flicoteaux's, there was a dignity in his manner,\nspringing doubtless from the consciousness of a purpose that filled\nhis life, a dignity which made him unapproachable. He had the\nexpression of a thinker, meditation dwelt on the fine nobly carved\nbrow. You could tell from the dark bright eyes, so clear-sighted and\nquick to observe, that their owner was wont to probe to the bottom of\nthings. He gesticulated very little, his demeanor was grave. Lucien\nfelt an involuntary respect for him.\n\nMany times already the pair had looked at each other at the\nBibliotheque or at Flicoteaux's; many times they had been on the point\nof speaking, but neither of them had ventured so far as yet. The\nsilent young man went off to the further end of the library, on the\nside at right angles to the Place de la Sorbonne, and Lucien had no\nopportunity of making his acquaintance, although he felt drawn to a\nworker whom he knew by indescribable tokens for a character of no\ncommon order. Both, as they came to know afterwards, were\nunsophisticated and shy, given to fears which cause a pleasurable\nemotion to solitary creatures. Perhaps they never would have been\nbrought into communication if they had not come across each other that\nday of Lucien's disaster; for as Lucien turned into the Rue des Gres,\nhe saw the student coming away from the Bibliotheque Sainte-Genevieve.\n\n\"The library is closed; I don't know why, monsieur,\" said he.\n\nTears were standing in Lucien's eyes; he expressed his thanks by one\nof those gestures that speak more eloquently than words, and unlock\nhearts at once when two men meet in youth. They went together along\nthe Rue des Gres towards the Rue de la Harpe.\n\n\"As that is so, I shall go to the Luxembourg for a walk,\" said Lucien.\n\"When you have come out, it is not easy to settle down to work again.\"\n\n\"No; one's ideas will not flow in the proper current,\" remarked the\nstranger. \"Something seems to have annoyed you, monsieur?\"\n\n\"I have just had a queer adventure,\" said Lucien, and he told the\nhistory of his visit to the Quai, and gave an account of his\nsubsequent dealings with the old bookseller. He gave his name and said\na word or two of his position. In one month or thereabouts he had\nspent sixty francs on his board, thirty for lodging, twenty more\nfrancs in going to the theatre, and ten at Blosse's reading room--one\nhundred and twenty francs in all, and now he had just a hundred and\ntwenty francs in hand.\n\n\"Your story is mine, monsieur, and the story of ten or twelve hundred\nyoung fellows besides who come from the country to Paris every year.\nThere are others even worse off than we are. Do you see that theatre?\"\nhe continued, indicating the turrets of the Odeon. \"There came one day\nto lodge in one of the houses in the square a man of talent who had\nfallen into the lowest depths of poverty. He was married, in addition\nto the misfortunes which we share with him, to a wife whom he loved;\nand the poorer or the richer, as you will, by two children. He was\nburdened with debt, but he put his faith in his pen. He took a comedy\nin five acts to the Odeon; the comedy was accepted, the management\narranged to bring it out, the actors learned their parts, the stage\nmanager urged on the rehearsals. Five several bits of luck, five\ndramas to be performed in real life, and far harder tasks than the\nwriting of a five-act play. The poor author lodged in a garret; you\ncan see the place from here. He drained his last resources to live\nuntil the first representation; his wife pawned her clothes, they all\nlived on dry bread. On the day of the final rehearsal, the household\nowed fifty francs in the Quarter to the baker, the milkwoman, and the\nporter. The author had only the strictly necessary clothes--a coat, a\nshirt, trousers, a waistcoat, and a pair of boots. He felt sure of his\nsuccess; he kissed his wife. The end of their troubles was at hand.\n'At last! There is nothing against us now,' cried he.--'Yes, there is\nfire,' said his wife; 'look, the Odeon is on fire!'--The Odeon was on\nfire, monsieur. So do not you complain. You have clothes, you have\nneither wife nor child, you have a hundred and twenty francs for\nemergencies in your pocket, and you owe no one a penny.--Well, the\npiece went through a hundred and fifty representations at the Theatre\nLouvois. The King allowed the author a pension. 'Genius is patience,'\nas Buffon said. And patience after all is a man's nearest approach to\nNature's processes of creation. What is Art, monsieur, but Nature\nconcentrated?\"\n\nBy this time the young men were striding along the walks of the\nLuxembourg, and in no long time Lucien learned the name of the\nstranger who was doing his best to administer comfort. That name has\nsince grown famous. Daniel d'Arthez is one of the most illustrious of\nliving men of letters; one of the rare few who show us an example of\n\"a noble gift with a noble nature combined,\" to quote a poet's fine\nthought.\n\n\"There is no cheap route to greatness,\" Daniel went on in his kind\nvoice. \"The works of Genius are watered with tears. The gift that is\nin you, like an existence in the physical world, passes through\nchildhood and its maladies. Nature sweeps away sickly or deformed\ncreatures, and Society rejects an imperfectly developed talent. Any\nman who means to rise above the rest must make ready for a struggle\nand be undaunted by difficulties. A great writer is a martyr who does\nnot die; that is all.--There is the stamp of genius on your forehead,\"\nd'Arthez continued, enveloping Lucien by a glance; \"but unless you\nhave within you the will of genius, unless you are gifted with angelic\npatience, unless, no matter how far the freaks of Fate have set you\nfrom your destined goal, you can find the way to your Infinite as the\nturtles in the Indies find their way to the ocean, you had better give\nup at once.\"\n\n\"Then do you yourself expect these ordeals?\" asked Lucien.\n\n\"Trials of every kind, slander and treachery, and effrontery and\ncunning, the rivals who act unfairly, and the keen competition of the\nliterary market,\" his companion said resignedly. \"What is a first\nloss, if only your work was good?\"\n\n\"Will you look at mine and give me your opinion?\" asked Lucien.\n\n\"So be it,\" said d'Arthez. \"I am living in the Rue des Quatre-Vents.\nDesplein, one of the most illustrious men of genius in our time, the\ngreatest surgeon that the world has known, once endured the martyrdom\nof early struggles with the first difficulties of a glorious career in\nthe same house. I think of that every night, and the thought gives me\nthe stock of courage that I need every morning. I am living in the\nvery room where, like Rousseau, he had no Theresa. Come in an hour's\ntime. I shall be in.\"\n\nThe poets grasped each other's hands with a rush of melancholy and\ntender feeling inexpressible in words, and went their separate ways;\nLucien to fetch his manuscript, Daniel d'Arthez to pawn his watch and\nbuy a couple of faggots. The weather was cold, and his new-found\nfriend should find a fire in his room.\n\nLucien was punctual. He noticed at once that the house was of an even\npoorer class than the Hotel de Cluny. A staircase gradually became\nvisible at the further end of a dark passage; he mounted to the fifth\nfloor, and found d'Arthez's room.\n\nA bookcase of dark-stained wood, with rows of labeled cardboard cases\non the shelves, stood between the two crazy windows. A gaunt, painted\nwooden bedstead, of the kind seen in school dormitories, a\nnight-table, picked up cheaply somewhere, and a couple of horsehair\narmchairs, filled the further end of the room. The wall-paper, a\nHighland plaid pattern, was glazed over with the grime of years.\nBetween the window and the grate stood a long table littered with\npapers, and opposite the fireplace there was a cheap mahogany chest of\ndrawers. A second-hand carpet covered the floor--a necessary luxury,\nfor it saved firing. A common office armchair, cushioned with leather,\ncrimson once, but now hoary with wear, was drawn up to the table. Add\nhalf-a-dozen rickety chairs, and you have a complete list of the\nfurniture. Lucien noticed an old-fashioned candle-sconce for a\ncard-table, with an adjustable screen attached, and wondered to see\nfour wax candles in the sockets. D'Arthez explained that he could not\nendure the smell of tallow, a little trait denoting great delicacy of\nsense perception, and the exquisite sensibility which accompanies it.\n\nThe reading lasted for seven hours. Daniel listened conscientiously,\nforbearing to interrupt by word or comment--one of the rarest proofs\nof good taste in a listener.\n\n\"Well?\" queried Lucien, laying the manuscript on the chimney-piece.\n\n\"You have made a good start on the right way,\" d'Arthez answered\njudicially, \"but you must go over your work again. You must strike out\na different style for yourself if you do not mean to ape Sir Walter\nScott, for you have taken him for your model. You begin, for instance,\nas he begins, with long conversations to introduce your characters,\nand only when they have said their say does description and action\nfollow.\n\n\"This opposition, necessary in all work of a dramatic kind, comes\nlast. Just put the terms of the problem the other way round. Give\ndescriptions, to which our language lends itself so admirably, instead\nof diffuse dialogue, magnificent in Scott's work, but colorless in\nyour own. Lead naturally up to your dialogue. Plunge straight into the\naction. Treat your subject from different points of view, sometimes in\na side-light, sometimes retrospectively; vary your methods, in fact,\nto diversify your work. You may be original while adapting the Scots\nnovelist's form of dramatic dialogue to French history. There is no\npassion in Scott's novels; he ignores passion, or perhaps it was\ninterdicted by the hypocritical manners of his country. Woman for him\nis duty incarnate. His heroines, with possibly one or two exceptions,\nare all alike; he has drawn them all from the same model, as painters\nsay. They are, every one of them, descended from Clarissa Harlowe. And\nreturning continually, as he did, to the same idea of woman, how could\nhe do otherwise than produce a single type, varied only by degrees of\nvividness in the coloring? Woman brings confusion into Society through\npassion. Passion gives infinite possibilities. Therefore depict\npassion; you have one great resource open to you, foregone by the\ngreat genius for the sake of providing family reading for prudish\nEngland. In France you have the charming sinner, the brightly-colored\nlife of Catholicism, contrasted with sombre Calvinistic figures on a\nbackground of the times when passions ran higher than at any other\nperiod of our history.\n\n\"Every epoch which has left authentic records since the time of\nCharles the Great calls for at least one romance. Some require four or\nfive; the periods of Louis XIV., of Henry IV., of Francis I., for\ninstance. You would give us in this way a picturesque history of\nFrance, with the costumes and furniture, the houses and their\ninteriors, and domestic life, giving us the spirit of the time instead\nof a laborious narration of ascertained facts. Then there is further\nscope for originality. You can remove some of the popular delusions\nwhich disfigure the memories of most of our kings. Be bold enough in\nthis first work of yours to rehabilitate the great magnificent figure\nof Catherine, whom you have sacrificed to the prejudices which still\ncloud her name. And finally, paint Charles IX. for us as he really\nwas, and not as Protestant writers have made him. Ten years of\npersistent work, and fame and fortune will be yours.\"\n\nBy this time it was nine o'clock; Lucien followed the example set in\nsecret by his future friend by asking him to dine at Eldon's, and\nspent twelve francs at that restaurant. During the dinner Daniel\nadmitted Lucien into the secret of his hopes and studies. Daniel\nd'Arthez would not allow that any writer could attain to a pre-eminent\nrank without a profound knowledge of metaphysics. He was engaged in\nransacking the spoils of ancient and modern philosophy, and in the\nassimilation of it all; he would be like Moliere, a profound\nphilosopher first, and a writer of comedies afterwards. He was\nstudying the world of books and the living world about him--thought\nand fact. His friends were learned naturalists, young doctors of\nmedicine, political writers and artists, a number of earnest students\nfull of promise.\n\nD'Arthez earned a living by conscientious and ill-paid work; he wrote\narticles for encyclopaedias, dictionaries of biography and natural\nscience, doing just enough to enable him to live while he followed his\nown bent, and neither more nor less. He had a piece of imaginative\nwork on hand, undertaken solely for the sake of studying the resources\nof language, an important psychological study in the form of a novel,\nunfinished as yet, for d'Arthez took it up or laid it down as the\nhumor took him, and kept it for days of great distress. D'Arthez's\nrevelations of himself were made very simply, but to Lucien he seemed\nlike an intellectual giant; and by eleven o'clock, when they left the\nrestaurant, he began to feel a sudden, warm friendship for this\nnature, unconscious of its loftiness, this unostentatious worth.\n\nLucien took d'Arthez's advice unquestioningly, and followed it out to\nthe letter. The most magnificent palaces of fancy had been suddenly\nflung open to him by a nobly-gifted mind, matured already by thought\nand critical examinations undertaken for their own sake, not for\npublication, but for the solitary thinker's own satisfaction. The\nburning coal had been laid on the lips of the poet of Angouleme, a\nword uttered by a hard student in Paris had fallen upon ground\nprepared to receive it in the provincial. Lucien set about recasting\nhis work.\n\nIn his gladness at finding in the wilderness of Paris a nature\nabounding in generous and sympathetic feeling, the distinguished\nprovincial did, as all young creatures hungering for affection are\nwont to do; he fastened, like a chronic disease, upon this one friend\nthat he had found. He called for D'Arthez on his way to the\nBibliotheque, walked with him on fine days in the Luxembourg Gardens,\nand went with his friend every evening as far as the door of his\nlodging-house after sitting next to him at Flicoteaux's. He pressed\nclose to his friend's side as a soldier might keep by a comrade on the\nfrozen Russian plains.\n\nDuring those early days of his acquaintance, he noticed, not without\nchagrin, that his presence imposed a certain restraint on the circle\nof Daniel's intimates. The talk of those superior beings of whom\nd'Arthez spoke to him with such concentrated enthusiasm kept within\nthe bounds of a reserve but little in keeping with the evident warmth\nof their friendships. At these times Lucien discreetly took his leave,\na feeling of curiosity mingling with the sense of something like pain\nat the ostracism to which he was subjected by these strangers, who all\naddressed each other by their Christian names. Each one of them, like\nd'Arthez, bore the stamp of genius upon his forehead.\n\nAfter some private opposition, overcome by d'Arthez without Lucien's\nknowledge, the newcomer was at length judged worthy to make one of the\n_cenacle_ of lofty thinkers. Henceforward he was to be one of a little\ngroup of young men who met almost every evening in d'Arthez's room,\nunited by the keenest sympathies and by the earnestness of their\nintellectual life. They all foresaw a great writer in d'Arthez; they\nlooked upon him as their chief since the loss of one of their number,\na mystical genius, one of the most extraordinary intellects of the\nage. This former leader had gone back to his province for reasons on\nwhich it serves no purpose to enter, but Lucien often heard them speak\nof this absent friend as \"Louis.\" Several of the group were destined\nto fall by the way; but others, like d'Arthez, have since won all the\nfame that was their due. A few details as to the circle will readily\nexplain Lucien's strong feeling of interest and curiosity.\n\nOne among those who still survive was Horace Bianchon, then a\nhouse-student at the Hotel-Dieu; later, a shining light at the Ecole\nde Paris, and now so well known that it is needless to give any\ndescription of his appearance, genius, or character.\n\nNext came Leon Giraud, that profound philosopher and bold theorist,\nturning all systems inside out, criticising, expressing, and\nformulating, dragging them all to the feet of his idol--Humanity;\ngreat even in his errors, for his honesty ennobled his mistakes. An\nintrepid toiler, a conscientious scholar, he became the acknowledged\nhead of a school of moralists and politicians. Time alone can\npronounce upon the merits of his theories; but if his convictions have\ndrawn him into paths in which none of his old comrades tread, none the\nless he is still their faithful friend.\n\nArt was represented by Joseph Bridau, one of the best painters among\nthe younger men. But for a too impressionable nature, which made havoc\nof Joseph's heart, he might have continued the traditions of the great\nItalian masters, though, for that matter, the last word has not yet\nbeen said concerning him. He combines Roman outline with Venetian\ncolor; but love is fatal to his work, love not merely transfixes his\nheart, but sends his arrow through the brain, deranges the course of\nhis life, and sets the victim describing the strangest zigzags. If the\nmistress of the moment is too kind or too cruel, Joseph will send into\nthe Exhibition sketches where the drawing is clogged with color, or\npictures finished under the stress of some imaginary woe, in which he\ngave his whole attention to the drawing, and left the color to take\ncare of itself. He is a constant disappointment to his friends and the\npublic; yet Hoffmann would have worshiped him for his daring\nexperiments in the realms of art. When Bridau is wholly himself he is\nadmirable, and as praise is sweet to him, his disgust is great when\none praises the failures in which he alone discovers all that is\nlacking in the eyes of the public. He is whimsical to the last degree.\nHis friends have seen him destroy a finished picture because, in his\neyes, it looked too smooth. \"It is overdone,\" he would say; \"it is\nniggling work.\"\n\nWith his eccentric, yet lofty nature, with a nervous organization and\nall that it entails of torment and delight, the craving for perfection\nbecomes morbid. Intellectually he is akin to Sterne, though he is not\na literary worker. There is an indescribable piquancy about his\nepigrams and sallies of thought. He is eloquent, he knows how to love,\nbut the uncertainty that appears in his execution is a part of the\nvery nature of the man. The brotherhood loved him for the very\nqualities which the philistine would style defects.\n\nLast among the living comes Fulgence Ridal. No writer of our times\npossesses more of the exuberant spirit of pure comedy than this poet,\ncareless of fame, who will fling his more commonplace productions to\ntheatrical managers, and keep the most charming scenes in the seraglio\nof his brain for himself and his friends. Of the public he asks just\nsufficient to secure his independence, and then declines to do\nanything more. Indolent and prolific as Rossini, compelled, like great\npoet-comedians, like Moliere and Rabelais, to see both sides of\neverything, and all that is to be said both for and against, he is a\nsceptic, ready to laugh at all things. Fulgence Ridal is a great\npractical philosopher. His worldly wisdom, his genius for observation,\nhis contempt for fame (\"fuss,\" as he calls it) have not seared a kind\nheart. He is as energetic on behalf of another as he is careless where\nhis own interests are concerned; and if he bestirs himself, it is for\na friend. Living up to his Rabelaisian mask, he is no enemy to good\ncheer, though he never goes out of his way to find it; he is\nmelancholy and gay. His friends dubbed him the \"Dog of the Regiment.\"\nYou could have no better portrait of the man than his nickname.\n\nThree more of the band, at least as remarkable as the friends who have\njust been sketched in outline, were destined to fall by the way. Of\nthese, Meyraux was the first. Meyraux died after stirring up the\nfamous controversy between Cuvier and Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, a great\nquestion which divided the whole scientific world into two opposite\ncamps, with these two men of equal genius as leaders. This befell some\nmonths before the death of the champion of rigorous analytical science\nas opposed to the pantheism of one who is still living to bear an\nhonored name in Germany. Meyraux was the friend of that \"Louis\" of\nwhom death was so soon to rob the intellectual world.\n\nWith these two, both marked by death, and unknown to-day in spite of\ntheir wide knowledge and their genius, stands a third, Michel\nChrestien, the great Republican thinker, who dreamed of European\nFederation, and had no small share in bringing about the\nSaint-Simonian movement of 1830. A politician of the calibre of\nSaint-Just and Danton, but simple, meek as a maid, and brimful of\nillusions and loving-kindness; the owner of a singing voice which\nwould have sent Mozart, or Weber, or Rossini into ecstasies, for his\nsinging of certain songs of Beranger's could intoxicate the heart in\nyou with poetry, or hope, or love--Michel Chrestien, poor as Lucien,\npoor as Daniel d'Arthez, as all the rest of his friends, gained a\nliving with the haphazard indifference of a Diogenes. He indexed\nlengthy works, he drew up prospectuses for booksellers, and kept his\ndoctrines to himself, as the grave keeps the secrets of the dead. Yet\nthe gay bohemian of intellectual life, the great statesman who might\nhave changed the face of the world, fell as a private soldier in the\ncloister of Saint-Merri; some shopkeeper's bullet struck down one of\nthe noblest creatures that ever trod French soil, and Michel Chrestien\ndied for other doctrines than his own. His Federation scheme was more\ndangerous to the aristocracy of Europe than the Republican propaganda;\nit was more feasible and less extravagant than the hideous doctrines\nof indefinite liberty proclaimed by the young madcaps who assume the\ncharacter of heirs of the Convention. All who knew the noble plebeian\nwept for him; there is not one of them but remembers, and often\nremembers, a great obscure politician.\n\nEsteem and friendship kept the peace between the extremes of hostile\nopinion and conviction represented in the brotherhood. Daniel d'Arthez\ncame of a good family in Picardy. His belief in the Monarchy was quite\nas strong as Michel Chrestien's faith in European Federation. Fulgence\nRidal scoffed at Leon Giraud's philosophical doctrines, while Giraud\nhimself prophesied for d'Arthez's benefit the approaching end of\nChristianity and the extinction of the institution of the family.\nMichel Chrestien, a believer in the religion of Christ, the divine\nlawgiver, who taught the equality of men, would defend the immortality\nof the soul from Bianchon's scalpel, for Horace Bianchon was before\nall things an analyst.\n\nThere was plenty of discussion, but no bickering. Vanity was not\nengaged, for the speakers were also the audience. They would talk over\ntheir work among themselves and take counsel of each other with the\ndelightful openness of youth. If the matter in hand was serious, the\nopponent would leave his own position to enter into his friend's point\nof view; and being an impartial judge in a matter outside his own\nsphere, would prove the better helper; envy, the hideous treasure of\ndisappointment, abortive talent, failure, and mortified vanity, was\nquite unknown among them. All of them, moreover, were going their\nseparate ways. For these reasons, Lucien and others admitted to their\nsociety felt at their ease in it. Wherever you find real talent, you\nwill find frank good fellowship and sincerity, and no sort of\npretension, the wit that caresses the intellect and never is aimed at\nself-love.\n\nWhen the first nervousness, caused by respect, wore off, it was\nunspeakably pleasant to make one of this elect company of youth.\nFamiliarity did not exclude in each a consciousness of his own value,\nnor a profound esteem for his neighbor; and finally, as every member\nof the circle felt that he could afford to receive or to give, no one\nmade a difficulty of accepting. Talk was unflagging, full of charm,\nand ranging over the most varied topics; words light as arrows sped to\nthe mark. There was a strange contrast between the dire material\npoverty in which the young men lived and the splendor of their\nintellectual wealth. They looked upon the practical problems of\nexistence simply as matter for friendly jokes. The cold weather\nhappened to set in early that year. Five of d'Arthez's friends\nappeared one day, each concealing firewood under his cloak; the same\nidea had occurred to the five, as it sometimes happens that all the\nguests at a picnic are inspired with the notion of bringing a pie as\ntheir contribution.\n\nAll of them were gifted with the moral beauty which reacts upon the\nphysical form, and, no less than work and vigils, overlays a youthful\nface with a shade of divine gold; purity of life and the fire of\nthought had brought refinement and regularity into features somewhat\npinched and rugged. The poet's amplitude of brow was a striking\ncharacteristic common to them all; the bright, sparkling eyes told of\ncleanliness of life. The hardships of penury, when they were felt at\nall, were born so gaily and embraced with such enthusiasm, that they\nhad left no trace to mar the serenity peculiar to the faces of the\nyoung who have no grave errors laid to their charge as yet, who have\nnot stooped to any of the base compromises wrung from impatience of\npoverty by the strong desire to succeed. The temptation to use any\nmeans to this end is the greater since that men of letters are lenient\nwith bad faith and extend an easy indulgence to treachery.\n\nThere is an element in friendship which doubles its charm and renders\nit indissoluble--a sense of certainty which is lacking in love. These\nyoung men were sure of themselves and of each other; the enemy of one\nwas the enemy of all; the most urgent personal considerations would\nhave been shattered if they had clashed with the sacred solidarity of\ntheir fellowship. All alike incapable of disloyalty, they could oppose\na formidable No to any accusation brought against the absent and\ndefend them with perfect confidence. With a like nobility of nature\nand strength of feeling, it was possible to think and speak freely on\nall matters of intellectual or scientific interest; hence the honesty\nof their friendships, the gaiety of their talk, and with this\nintellectual freedom of the community there was no fear of being\nmisunderstood; they stood upon no ceremony with each other; they\nshared their troubles and joys, and gave thought and sympathy from\nfull hearts. The charming delicacy of feeling which makes the tale of\n_Deux Amis_ a treasury for great souls, was the rule of their daily\nlife. It may be imagined, therefore, that their standard of\nrequirements was not an easy one; they were too conscious of their\nworth, too well aware of their happiness, to care to trouble their\nlife with the admixture of a new and unknown element.\n\nThis federation of interests and affection lasted for twenty years\nwithout a collision or disappointment. Death alone could thin the\nnumbers of the noble Pleiades, taking first Louis Lambert, later\nMeyraux and Michel Chrestien.\n\nWhen Michel Chrestien fell in 1832 his friends went, in spite of the\nperils of the step, to find his body at Saint-Merri; and Horace\nBianchon, Daniel d'Arthez, Leon Giraud, Joseph Bridau, and Fulgence\nRidal performed the last duties to the dead, between two political\nfires. By night they buried their beloved in the cemetery of\nPere-Lachaise; Horace Bianchon, undaunted by the difficulties, cleared\nthem away one after another--it was he indeed who besought the\nauthorities for permission to bury the fallen insurgent and confessed\nto his old friendship with the dead Federalist. The little group of\nfriends present at the funeral with those five great men will never\nforget that touching scene.\n\nAs you walk in the trim cemetery you will see a grave purchased in\nperpetuity, a grass-covered mound with a dark wooden cross above it,\nand the name in large red letters--MICHEL CHRESTIEN. There is no other\nmonument like it. The friends thought to pay a tribute to the sternly\nsimple nature of the man by the simplicity of the record of his death.\n\nSo, in that chilly garret, the fairest dreams of friendship were\nrealized. These men were brothers leading lives of intellectual\neffort, loyally helping each other, making no reservations, not even\nof their worst thoughts; men of vast acquirements, natures tried in\nthe crucible of poverty. Once admitted as an equal among such elect\nsouls, Lucien represented beauty and poetry. They admired the sonnets\nwhich he read to them; they would ask him for a sonnet as he would ask\nMichel Chrestien for a song. And, in the desert of Paris, Lucien found\nan oasis in the Rue des Quatre-Vents.\n\nAt the beginning of October, Lucien had spent the last of his money on\na little firewood; he was half-way through the task of recasting his\nwork, the most strenuous of all toil, and he was penniless. As for\nDaniel d'Arthez, burning blocks of spent tan, and facing poverty like\na hero, not a word of complaint came from him; he was as sober as any\nelderly spinster, and methodical as a miser. This courage called out\nLucien's courage; he had only newly come into the circle, and shrank\nwith invincible repugnance from speaking of his straits. One morning\nhe went out, manuscript in hand, and reached the Rue du Coq; he would\nsell _The Archer of Charles IX._ to Doguereau; but Doguereau was out.\nLucien little knew how indulgent great natures can be to the\nweaknesses of others. Every one of the friends had thought of the\npeculiar troubles besetting the poetic temperament, of the prostration\nwhich follows upon the struggle, when the soul has been overwrought by\nthe contemplation of that nature which it is the task of art to\nreproduce. And strong as they were to endure their own ills, they felt\nkeenly for Lucien's distress; they guessed that his stock of money was\nfailing; and after all the pleasant evenings spent in friendly talk\nand deep meditations, after the poetry, the confidences, the bold\nflights over the fields of thought or into the far future of the\nnations, yet another trait was to prove how little Lucien had\nunderstood these new friends of his.\n\n\"Lucien, dear fellow,\" said Daniel, \"you did not dine at Flicoteaux's\nyesterday, and we know why.\"\n\nLucien could not keep back the overflowing tears.\n\n\"You showed a want of confidence in us,\" said Michel Chrestien; \"we\nshall chalk that up over the chimney, and when we have scored ten we\nwill----\"\n\n\"We have all of us found a bit of extra work,\" said Bianchon; \"for my\nown part, I have been looking after a rich patient for Desplein;\nd'Arthez has written an article for the _Revue Encyclopedique_;\nChrestien thought of going out to sing in the Champs Elysees of an\nevening with a pocket-handkerchief and four candles, but he found a\npamphlet to write instead for a man who has a mind to go into\npolitics, and gave his employer six hundred francs worth of\nMachiavelli; Leon Giraud borrowed fifty francs of his publisher,\nJoseph sold one or two sketches; and Fulgence's piece was given on\nSunday, and there was a full house.\"\n\n\"Here are two hundred francs,\" said Daniel, \"and let us say no more\nabout it.\"\n\n\"Why, if he is not going to hug us all as if we had done something\nextraordinary!\" cried Chrestien.\n\nLucien, meanwhile, had written to the home circle. His letter was a\nmasterpiece of sensibility and goodwill, as well as a sharp cry wrung\nfrom him by distress. The answers which he received the next day will\ngive some idea of the delight that Lucien took in this living\nencyclopedia of angelic spirits, each of whom bore the stamp of the\nart or science which he followed:--\n\n\n                    _David Sechard to Lucien._\n\n  \"MY DEAR LUCIEN,--Enclosed herewith is a bill at ninety days,\n  payable to your order, for two hundred francs. You can draw on M.\n  Metivier, paper merchant, our Paris correspondent in the Rue\n  Serpente. My good Lucien, we have absolutely nothing. Eve has\n  undertaken the charge of the printing-house, and works at her task\n  with such devotion, patience, and industry, that I bless heaven\n  for giving me such an angel for a wife. She herself says that it\n  is impossible to send you the least help. But I think, my friend\n  now that you are started in so promising a way, with such great\n  and noble hearts for your companions, that you can hardly fail to\n  reach the greatness to which you were born, aided as you are by\n  intelligence almost divine in Daniel d'Arthez and Michel Chrestien\n  and Leon Giraud, and counseled by Meyraux and Bianchon and Ridal,\n  whom we have come to know through your dear letter. So I have\n  drawn this bill without Eve's knowledge, and I will contrive\n  somehow to meet it when the time comes. Keep on your way, Lucien;\n  it is rough, but it will be glorious. I can bear anything but the\n  thought of you sinking into the sloughs of Paris, of which I saw\n  so much. Have sufficient strength of mind to do as you are doing,\n  and keep out of scrapes and bad company, wild young fellows and\n  men of letters of a certain stamp, whom I learned to take at their\n  just valuation when I lived in Paris. Be a worthy compeer of the\n  divine spirits whom we have learned to love through you. Your life\n  will soon meet with its reward. Farewell, dearest brother; you\n  have sent transports of joy to my heart. I did not expect such\n  courage of you.\n\n\"DAVID.\"\n\n\n                    _Eve Sechard to Lucien._\n\n  \"DEAR,--your letter made all of us cry. As for the noble hearts to\n  whom your good angel surely led you, tell them that a mother and a\n  poor young wife will pray for them night and morning; and if the\n  most fervent prayers can reach the Throne of God, surely they will\n  bring blessings upon you all. Their names are engraved upon my\n  heart. Ah! some day I shall see your friends; I will go to Paris,\n  if I have to walk the whole way, to thank them for their\n  friendship for you, for to me the thought has been like balm to\n  smarting wounds. We are working like day laborers here, dear. This\n  husband of mine, the unknown great man whom I love more and more\n  every day, as I discover moment by moment the wealth of his\n  nature, leaves the printing-house more and more to me. Why, I\n  guess. Our poverty, yours, and ours, and our mother's, is\n  heartbreaking to him. Our adored David is a Prometheus gnawed by a\n  vulture, a haggard, sharp-beaked regret. As for himself, noble\n  fellow, he scarcely thinks of himself; he is hoping to make a\n  fortune for _us_. He spends his whole time in experiments in\n  paper-making; he begged me to take his place and look after the\n  business, and gives me as much help as his preoccupation allows.\n  Alas! I shall be a mother soon. That should have been a crowning\n  joy; but as things are, it saddens me. Poor mother! she has grown\n  young again; she has found strength to go back to her tiring\n  nursing. We should be happy if it were not for these money cares.\n  Old Father Sechard will not give his son a farthing. David went\n  over to see if he could borrow a little for you, for we were in\n  despair over your letter. 'I know Lucien,' David said; 'he will\n  lose his head and do something rash.'--I gave him a good scolding.\n  'My brother disappoint us in any way!' I told him, 'Lucien knows\n  that I should die of sorrow.'--Mother and I have pawned a few\n  things; David does not know about it, mother will redeem them as\n  soon as she has made a little money. In this way we have managed\n  to put together a hundred francs, which I am sending you by the\n  coach. If I did not answer your last letter, do not remember it\n  against me, dear; we were working all night just then. I have been\n  working like a man. Oh, I had no idea that I was so strong!\n\n  \"Mme. de Bargeton is a heartless woman; she has no soul; even if\n  she cared for you no longer, she owed it to herself to use her\n  influence for you and to help you when she had torn you from us to\n  plunge you into that dreadful sea of Paris. Only by the special\n  blessing of Heaven could you have met with true friends there\n  among those crowds of men and innumerable interests. She is not\n  worth a regret. I used to wish that there might be some devoted\n  woman always with you, a second myself; but now I know that your\n  friends will take my place, and I am happy. Spread your wings, my\n  dear great genius, you will be our pride as well as our beloved.\n\n\"EVE.\"\n\n\n  \"My darling,\" the mother wrote, \"I can only add my blessing to all\n  that your sister says, and assure you that you are more in my\n  thoughts and in my prayers (alas!) than those whom I see daily;\n  for some hearts, the absent are always in the right, and so it is\n  with the heart of your mother.\"\n\n\nSo two days after the loan was offered so graciously, Lucien repaid\nit. Perhaps life had never seemed so bright to him as at that moment;\nbut the touch of self-love in his joy did not escape the delicate\nsensibility and searching eyes of his friends.\n\n\"Any one might think that you were afraid to owe us anything,\"\nexclaimed Fulgence.\n\n\"Oh! the pleasure that he takes in returning the money is a very\nserious symptom to my mind,\" said Michel Chrestien. \"It confirms some\nobservations of my own. There is a spice of vanity in Lucien.\"\n\n\"He is a poet,\" said d'Arthez.\n\n\"But do you grudge me such a very natural feeling?\" asked Lucien.\n\n\"We should bear in mind that he did not hide it,\" said Leon Giraud;\n\"he is still open with us; but I am afraid that he may come to feel\nshy of us.\"\n\n\"And why?\" Lucien asked.\n\n\"We can read your thoughts,\" answered Joseph Bridau.\n\n\"There is a diabolical spirit in you that will seek to justify courses\nwhich are utterly contrary to our principles. Instead of being a\nsophist in theory, you will be a sophist in practice.\"\n\n\"Ah! I am afraid of that,\" said d'Arthez. \"You will carry on admirable\ndebates in your own mind, Lucien, and take up a lofty position in\ntheory, and end by blameworthy actions. You will never be at one with\nyourself.\"\n\n\"What ground have you for these charges?\"\n\n\"Thy vanity, dear poet, is so great that it intrudes itself even into\nthy friendships!\" cried Fulgence. \"All vanity of that sort is a\nsymptom of shocking egoism, and egoism poisons friendship.\"\n\n\"Oh! dear,\" said Lucien, \"you cannot know how much I love you all.\"\n\n\"If you loved us as we love you, would you have been in such a hurry\nto return the money which we had such pleasure in lending? or have\nmade so much of it?\"\n\n\"We don't lend here; we give,\" said Joseph Bridau roughly.\n\n\"Don't think us unkind, dear boy,\" said Michel Chrestien; \"we are\nlooking forward. We are afraid lest some day you may prefer a petty\nrevenge to the joys of pure friendship. Read Goethe's _Tasso_, the great\nmaster's greatest work, and you will see how the poet-hero loved\ngorgeous stuffs and banquets and triumph and applause. Very well, be\nTasso without his folly. Perhaps the world and its pleasures tempt\nyou? Stay with us. Carry all the cravings of vanity into the world of\nimagination. Transpose folly. Keep virtue for daily wear, and let\nimagination run riot, instead of doing, as d'Arthez says, thinking\nhigh thoughts and living beneath them.\"\n\nLucien hung his head. His friends were right.\n\n\"I confess that you are stronger than I,\" he said, with a charming\nglance at them. \"My back and shoulders are not made to bear the burden\nof Paris life; I cannot struggle bravely. We are born with different\ntemperaments and faculties, and you know better than I that faults and\nvirtues have their reverse side. I am tired already, I confess.\"\n\n\"We will stand by you,\" said d'Arthez; \"it is just in these ways that\na faithful friendship is of use.\"\n\n\"The help that I have just received is precarious, and every one of us\nis just as poor as another; want will soon overtake me again.\nChrestien, at the service of the first that hires him, can do nothing\nwith the publishers; Bianchon is quite out of it; d'Arthez's\nbooksellers only deal in scientific and technical books--they have no\nconnection with publishers of new literature; and as for Horace and\nFulgence Ridal and Bridau, their work lies miles away from the\nbooksellers. There is no help for it; I must make up my mind one way\nor another.\"\n\n\"Stick by us, and make up your mind to it,\" said Bianchon. \"Bear up\nbravely, and trust in hard work.\"\n\n\"But what is hardship for you is death for me,\" Lucien put in quickly.\n\n\"Before the cock crows thrice,\" smiled Leon Giraud, \"this man will\nbetray the cause of work for an idle life and the vices of Paris.\"\n\n\"Where has work brought you?\" asked Lucien, laughing.\n\n\"When you start out from Paris for Italy, you don't find Rome\nhalf-way,\" said Joseph Bridau. \"You want your pease to grow ready\nbuttered for you.\"\n\nThe conversation ended in a joke, and they changed the subject.\nLucien's friends, with their perspicacity and delicacy of heart, tried\nto efface the memory of the little quarrel; but Lucien knew\nthenceforward that it was no easy matter to deceive them. He soon fell\ninto despair, which he was careful to hide from such stern mentors as\nhe imagined them to be; and the Southern temper that runs so easily\nthrough the whole gamut of mental dispositions, set him making the\nmost contradictory resolutions.\n\nAgain and again he talked of making the plunge into journalism; and\ntime after time did his friends reply with a \"Mind you do nothing of\nthe sort!\"\n\n\"It would be the tomb of the beautiful, gracious Lucien whom we love\nand know,\" said d'Arthez.\n\n\"You would not hold out for long between the two extremes of toil and\npleasure which make up a journalist's life, and resistance is the very\nfoundation of virtue. You would be so delighted to exercise your power\nof life and death over the offspring of the brain, that you would be\nan out-and-out journalist in two months' time. To be a journalist\n--that is to turn Herod in the republic of letters. The man who will\nsay anything will end by sticking at nothing. That was Napoleon's\nmaxim, and it explains itself.\"\n\n\"But you would be with me, would you not?\" asked Lucien.\n\n\"Not by that time,\" said Fulgence. \"If you were a journalist, you\nwould no more think of us than the Opera girl in all her glory, with\nher adorers and her silk-lined carriage, thinks of the village at home\nand her cows and her sabots. You could never resist the temptation to\npen a witticism, though it should bring tears to a friend's eyes. I\ncome across journalists in theatre lobbies; it makes me shudder to see\nthem. Journalism is an inferno, a bottomless pit of iniquity and\ntreachery and lies; no one can traverse it undefiled, unless, like\nDante, he is protected by Virgil's sacred laurel.\"\n\nBut the more the set of friends opposed the idea of journalism, the\nmore Lucien's desire to know its perils grew and tempted him. He began\nto debate within his own mind; was it not ridiculous to allow want to\nfind him a second time defenceless? He bethought him of the failure of\nhis attempts to dispose of his first novel, and felt but little\ntempted to begin a second. How, besides, was he to live while he was\nwriting another romance? One month of privation had exhausted his\nstock of patience. Why should he not do nobly that which journalists\ndid ignobly and without principle? His friends insulted him with their\ndoubts; he would convince them of his strength of mind. Some day,\nperhaps, he would be of use to them; he would be the herald of their\nfame!\n\n\"And what sort of a friendship is it which recoils from complicity?\"\ndemanded he one evening of Michel Chrestien; Lucien and Leon Giraud\nwere walking home with their friend.\n\n\"We shrink from nothing,\" Michel Chrestien made reply. \"If you were so\nunlucky as to kill your mistress, I would help you to hide your crime,\nand could still respect you; but if you were to turn spy, I should\nshun you with abhorrence, for a spy is systematically shameless and\nbase. There you have journalism summed up in a sentence. Friendship\ncan pardon error and the hasty impulse of passion; it is bound to be\ninexorable when a man deliberately traffics in his own soul, and\nintellect, and opinions.\"\n\n\"Why cannot I turn journalist to sell my volume of poetry and the\nnovel, and then give up at once?\"\n\n\"Machiavelli might do so, but not Lucien de Rubempre,\" said Leon\nGiraud.\n\n\"Very well,\" exclaimed Lucien; \"I will show you that I can do as much\nas Machiavelli.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" cried Michel, grasping Leon's hand, \"you have done it, Leon.\n--Lucien,\" he continued, \"you have three hundred francs in hand; you\ncan live comfortably for three months; very well, then, work hard and\nwrite another romance. D'Arthez and Fulgence will help you with the\nplot; you will improve, you will be a novelist. And I, meanwhile, will\nenter one of those _lupanars_ of thought; for three months I will be a\njournalist. I will sell your books to some bookseller or other by\nattacking his publications; I will write the articles myself; I will\nget others for you. We will organize a success; you shall be a great\nman, and still remain our Lucien.\"\n\n\"You must despise me very much, if you think that I should perish\nwhile you escape,\" said the poet.\n\n\"O Lord, forgive him; it is a child!\" cried Michel Chrestien.\n\n\n\nWhen Lucien's intellect had been stimulated by the evenings spent in\nd'Arthez's garret, he had made some study of the jokes and articles in\nthe smaller newspapers. He was at least the equal, he felt, of the\nwittiest contributors; in private he tried some mental gymnastics of\nthe kind, and went out one morning with the triumphant idea of finding\nsome colonel of such light skirmishers of the press and enlisting in\ntheir ranks. He dressed in his best and crossed the bridges, thinking\nas he went that authors, journalists, and men of letters, his future\ncomrades, in short, would show him rather more kindness and\ndisinterestedness than the two species of booksellers who had so\ndashed his hopes. He should meet with fellow-feeling, and something of\nthe kindly and grateful affection which he found in the _cenacle_ of the\nRue des Quatre-Vents. Tormented by emotion, consequent upon the\npresentiments to which men of imagination cling so fondly, half\nbelieving, half battling with their belief in them, he arrived in the\nRue Saint-Fiacre off the Boulevard Montmartre. Before a house,\noccupied by the offices of a small newspaper, he stopped, and at the\nsight of it his heart began to throb as heavily as the pulses of a\nyouth upon the threshold of some evil haunt.\n\nNevertheless, upstairs he went, and found the offices in the low\n_entresol_ between the ground floor and the first story. The first room\nwas divided down the middle by a partition, the lower half of solid\nwood, the upper lattice work to the ceiling. In this apartment Lucien\ndiscovered a one-armed pensioner supporting several reams of paper on\nhis head with his remaining hand, while between his teeth he held the\npassbook which the Inland Revenue Department requires every newspaper\nto produce with each issue. This ill-favored individual, owner of a\nyellow countenance covered with red excrescences, to which he owed his\nnickname of \"Coloquinte,\" indicated a personage behind the lattice as\nthe Cerberus of the paper. This was an elderly officer with a medal on\nhis chest and a silk skull-cap on his head; his nose was almost hidden\nby a pair of grizzled moustaches, and his person was hidden as\ncompletely in an ample blue overcoat as the body of the turtle in its\ncarapace.\n\n\"From what date do you wish your subscription to commence, sir?\"\ninquired the Emperor's officer.\n\n\"I did not come about a subscription,\" returned Lucien. Looking about\nhim, he saw a placard fastened on a door, corresponding to the one by\nwhich he had entered, and read the words--EDITOR'S OFFICE, and below,\nin smaller letters, _No admittance except on business_.\n\n\"A complaint, I expect?\" replied the veteran. \"Ah! yes; we have been\nhard on Mariette. What would you have? I don't know the why and\nwherefore of it yet.--But if you want satisfaction, I am ready for\nyou,\" he added, glancing at a collection of small arms and foils\nstacked in a corner, the armory of the modern warrior.\n\n\"That was still further from my intention, sir. I have come to speak\nto the editor.\"\n\n\"Nobody is ever here before four o'clock.\"\n\n\"Look you here, Giroudeau, old chap,\" remarked a voice, \"I make it\neleven columns; eleven columns at five francs apiece is fifty-five\nfrancs, and I have only been paid forty; so you owe me another fifteen\nfrancs, as I have been telling you.\"\n\nThese words proceeded from a little weasel-face, pallid and\nsemi-transparent as the half-boiled white of an egg; two slits of eyes\nlooked out of it, mild blue in tint, but appallingly malignant in\nexpression; and the owner, an insignificant young man, was completely\nhidden by the veteran's opaque person. It was a blood-curdling voice,\na sound between the mewing of a cat and the wheezy chokings of a\nhyena.\n\n\"Yes, yes, my little militiaman,\" retorted he of the medal, \"but you\nare counting the headings and white lines. I have Finot's instructions\nto add up the totals of the lines, and to divide them by the proper\nnumber for each column; and after I performed that concentrating\noperation on your copy, there were three columns less.\"\n\n\"He doesn't pay for the blanks, the Jew! He reckons them in though\nwhen he sends up the total of his work to his partner, and he gets\npaid for them too. I will go and see Etienne Lousteau, Vernou----\"\n\n\"I cannot go beyond my orders, my boy,\" said the veteran. \"What! do\nyou cry out against your foster-mother for a matter of fifteen francs?\nyou that turn out an article as easily as I smoke a cigar. Fifteen\nfrancs! why, you will give a bowl of punch to your friends, or win an\nextra game of billiards, and there's an end of it!\"\n\n\"Finot's savings will cost him very dear,\" said the contributor as he\ntook his departure.\n\n\"Now, would not anybody think that he was Rousseau and Voltaire rolled\nin one?\" the cashier remarked to himself as he glanced at Lucien.\n\n\"I will come in again at four, sir,\" said Lucien.\n\nWhile the argument proceeded, Lucien had been looking about him. He\nsaw upon the walls the portraits of Benjamin Constant, General Foy,\nand the seventeen illustrious orators of the Left, interspersed with\ncaricatures at the expense of the Government; but he looked more\nparticularly at the door of the sanctuary where, no doubt, the paper\nwas elaborated, the witty paper that amused him daily, and enjoyed the\nprivilege of ridiculing kings and the most portentous events, of\ncalling anything and everything in question with a jest. Then he\nsauntered along the boulevards. It was an entirely novel amusement;\nand so agreeable did he find it, that, looking at the turret clocks,\nhe saw the hour hands were pointing to four, and only then remembered\nthat he had not breakfasted.\n\nHe went at once in the direction of the Rue Saint-Fiacre, climbed the\nstair, and opened the door.\n\nThe veteran officer was absent; but the old pensioner, sitting on a\npile of stamped papers, was munching a crust and acting as sentinel\nresignedly. Coloquinte was as much accustomed to his work in the\noffice as to the fatigue duty of former days, understanding as much or\nas little about it as the why and wherefore of forced marches made by\nthe Emperor's orders. Lucien was inspired with the bold idea of\ndeceiving that formidable functionary. He settled his hat on his head,\nand walked into the editor's office as if he were quite at home.\n\nLooking eagerly about him, he beheld a round table covered with a\ngreen cloth, and half-a-dozen cherry-wood chairs, newly reseated with\nstraw. The colored brick floor had not been waxed, but it was clean;\nso clean that the public, evidently, seldom entered the room. There\nwas a mirror above the chimney-piece, and on the ledge below, amid a\nsprinkling of visiting-cards, stood a shopkeeper's clock, smothered\nwith dust, and a couple of candlesticks with tallow dips thrust into\ntheir sockets. A few antique newspapers lay on the table beside an\ninkstand containing some black lacquer-like substance, and a\ncollection of quill pens twisted into stars. Sundry dirty scraps of\npaper, covered with almost undecipherable hieroglyphs, proved to be\nmanuscript articles torn across the top by the compositor to check off\nthe sheets as they were set up. He admired a few rather clever\ncaricatures, sketched on bits of brown paper by somebody who evidently\nhad tried to kill time by killing something else to keep his hand in.\n\nOther works of art were pinned in the cheap sea-green wall-paper.\nThese consisted of nine pen-and-ink illustrations for _Le Solitaire_.\nThe work had attained to such an unheard-of European popularity, that\njournalists evidently were tired of it.--\"The Solitary makes his first\nappearance in the provinces; sensation among the women.--The Solitary\nperused at a chateau.--Effect of the Solitary on domestic animals.\n--The Solitary explained to savage tribes, with the most brilliant\nresults.--The Solitary translated into Chinese and presented by the\nauthor to the Emperor at Pekin.--The Mont Sauvage, Rape of Elodie.\"\n--(Lucien though this caricature very shocking, but he could not help\nlaughing at it.)--\"The Solitary under a canopy conducted in triumphal\nprocession by the newspapers.--The Solitary breaks the press to\nsplinters, and wounds the printers.--Read backwards, the superior\nbeauties of the Solitary produce a sensation at the Academie.\"--On a\nnewspaper-wrapper Lucien noticed a sketch of a contributor holding out\nhis hat, and beneath it the words, \"Finot! my hundred francs,\" and a\nname, since grown more notorious than famous.\n\nBetween the window and the chimney-piece stood a writing-table, a\nmahogany armchair, and a waste-paper basket on a strip of hearth-rug;\nthe dust lay thick on all these objects. There were short curtains in\nthe windows. About a score of new books lay on the writing-table,\ndeposited there apparently during the day, together with prints,\nmusic, snuff-boxes of the \"Charter\" pattern, a copy of the ninth\nedition of _Le Solitaire_ (the great joke of the moment), and some ten\nunopened letters.\n\nLucien had taken stock of this strange furniture, and made reflections\nof the most exhaustive kind upon it, when, the clock striking five, he\nreturned to question the pensioner. Coloquinte had finished his crust,\nand was waiting with the patience of a commissionaire, for the man of\nmedals, who perhaps was taking an airing on the boulevard.\n\nAt this conjuncture the rustle of a dress sounded on the stair, and\nthe light unmistakable footstep of a woman on the threshold. The\nnewcomer was passably pretty. She addressed herself to Lucien.\n\n\"Sir,\" she said, \"I know why you cry up Mlle. Virginie's hats so much;\nand I have come to put down my name for a year's subscription in the\nfirst place; but tell me your conditions----\"\n\n\"I am not connected with the paper, madame.\"\n\n\"Oh!\"\n\n\"A subscription dating from October?\" inquired the pensioner.\n\n\"What does the lady want to know?\" asked the veteran, reappearing on\nthe scene.\n\nThe fair milliner and the retired military man were soon deep in\nconverse; and when Lucien, beginning to lose patience, came back to\nthe first room, he heard the conclusion of the matter.\n\n\"Why, I shall be delighted, quite delighted, sir. Mlle. Florentine can\ncome to my shop and choose anything she likes. Ribbons are in my\ndepartment. So it is all quite settled. You will say no more about\nVirginie, a botcher that cannot design a new shape, while I have ideas\nof my own, I have.\"\n\nLucien heard a sound as of coins dropping into a cashbox, and the\nveteran began to make up his books for the day.\n\n\"I have been waiting here for an hour, sir,\" Lucien began, looking not\na little annoyed.\n\n\"And 'they' have not come yet!\" exclaimed Napoleon's veteran, civilly\nfeigning concern. \"I am not surprised at that. It is some time since I\nhave seen 'them' here. It is the middle of the month, you see. Those\nfine fellows only turn up on pay days--the 29th or the 30th.\"\n\n\"And M. Finot?\" asked Lucien, having caught the editor's name.\n\n\"He is in the Rue Feydeau, that's where he lives. Coloquinte, old\nchap, just take him everything that has come in to-day when you go\nwith the paper to the printers.\"\n\n\"Where is the newspaper put together?\" Lucien said to himself.\n\n\"The newspaper?\" repeated the officer, as he received the rest of the\nstamp money from Coloquinte, \"the newspaper?--broum! broum!--(Mind you\nare round at the printers' by six o'clock to-morrow, old chap, to send\noff the porters.)--The newspaper, sir, is written in the street, at\nthe writers' houses, in the printing-office between eleven and twelve\no'clock at night. In the Emperor's time, sir, these shops for spoiled\npaper were not known. Oh! he would have cleared them out with four men\nand a corporal; they would not have come over _him_ with their talk. But\nthat is enough of prattling. If my nephew finds it worth his while,\nand so long as they write for the son of the Other (broum! broum!)\n----after all, there is no harm in that. Ah! by the way, subscribers\ndon't seem to me to be advancing in serried columns; I shall leave my\npost.\"\n\n\"You seem to know all about the newspaper, sir,\" Lucien began.\n\n\"From a business point of view, broum! broum!\" coughed the soldier,\nclearing his throat. \"From three to five francs per column, according\nto ability.--Fifty lines to a column, forty letters to a line; no\nblanks; there you are! As for the staff, they are queer fish, little\nyoungsters whom I wouldn't take on for the commissariat; and because\nthey make fly tracks on sheets of white paper, they look down,\nforsooth, on an old Captain of Dragoons of the Guard, that retired\nwith a major's rank after entering every European capital with\nNapoleon.\"\n\nThe soldier of Napoleon brushed his coat, and made as if he would go\nout, but Lucien, swept to the door, had courage enough to make a\nstand.\n\n\"I came to be a contributor of the paper,\" he said. \"I am full of\nrespect, I vow and declare, for a captain of the Imperial Guard, those\nmen of bronze----\"\n\n\"Well said, my little civilian, there are several kinds of\ncontributors; which kind do you wish to be?\" replied the trooper,\nbearing down on Lucien, and descending the stairs. At the foot of the\nflight he stopped, but it was only to light a cigar at the porter's\nbox.\n\n\"If any subscribers come, you see them and take note of them, Mother\nChollet.--Simply subscribers, never know anything but subscribers,\" he\nadded, seeing that Lucien followed him. \"Finot is my nephew; he is the\nonly one of my family that has done anything to relieve me in my\nposition. So when anybody comes to pick a quarrel with Finot, he finds\nold Giroudeau, Captain of the Dragoons of the Guard, that set out as a\nprivate in a cavalry regiment in the army of the Sambre-et-Meuse, and\nwas fencing-master for five years to the First Hussars, army of Italy!\nOne, two, and the man that had any complaints to make would be turned\noff into the dark,\" he added, making a lunge. \"Now writers, my boy,\nare in different corps; there is the writer who writes and draws his\npay; there is the writer who writes and gets nothing (a volunteer we\ncall him); and, lastly, there is the writer who writes nothing, and he\nis by no means the stupidest, for he makes no mistakes; he gives\nhimself out for a literary man, he is on the paper, he treats us to\ndinners, he loafs about the theatres, he keeps an actress, he is very\nwell off. What do you mean to be?\"\n\n\"The man that does good work and gets good pay.\"\n\n\"You are like the recruits. They all want to be marshals of France.\nTake old Giroudeau's word for it, and turn right about, in\ndouble-quick time, and go and pick up nails in the gutter like that\ngood fellow yonder; you can tell by the look of him that he has been\nin the army.--Isn't it a shame that an old soldier who has walked into\nthe jaws of death hundreds of times should be picking up old iron in\nthe streets of Paris? Ah! God A'mighty! 'twas a shabby trick to desert\nthe Emperor.--Well, my boy, the individual you saw this morning has\nmade his forty francs a month. Are you going to do better? And,\naccording to Finot, he is the cleverest man on the staff.\"\n\n\"When you enlisted in the Sambre-et-Meuse, did they talk about\ndanger?\"\n\n\"Rather.\"\n\n\"Very well?\"\n\n\"Very well. Go and see my nephew Finot, a good fellow, as good a\nfellow as you will find, if you can find him, that is, for he is like\na fish, always on the move. In his way of business, there is no\nwriting, you see, it is setting others to write. That sort like\ngallivanting about with actresses better than scribbling on sheets of\npaper, it seems. Oh! they are queer customers, they are. Hope I may\nhave the honor of seeing you again.\"\n\nWith that the cashier raised his formidable loaded cane, one of the\ndefenders of Germainicus, and walked off, leaving Lucien in the\nstreet, as much bewildered by this picture of the newspaper world as\nhe had formerly been by the practical aspects of literature at Messrs.\nVidal and Porchon's establishment.\n\nTen several times did Lucien repair to the Rue Feydeau in search of\nAndoche Finot, and ten times he failed to find that gentleman. He went\nfirst thing in the morning; Finot had not come in. At noon, Finot had\ngone out; he was breakfasting at such and such a cafe. At the cafe, in\nanswer to inquiries of the waitress, made after surmounting\nunspeakable repugnance, Lucien heard that Finot had just left the\nplace. Lucien, at length tired out, began to regard Finot as a\nmythical and fabulous character; it appeared simpler to waylay Etienne\nLousteau at Flicoteaux's. That youthful journalist would, doubtless,\nexplain the mysteries that enveloped the paper for which he wrote.\n\nSince the day, a hundred times blessed, when Lucien made the\nacquaintance of Daniel d'Arthez, he had taken another seat at\nFlicoteaux's. The two friends dined side by side, talking in lowered\nvoices of the higher literature, of suggested subjects, and ways of\npresenting, opening up, and developing them. At the present time\nDaniel d'Arthez was correcting the manuscript of _The Archer of Charles\nIX._ He reconstructed whole chapters, and wrote the fine passages found\ntherein, as well as the magnificent preface, which is, perhaps, the\nbest thing in the book, and throws so much light on the work of the\nyoung school of literature. One day it so happened that Daniel had\nbeen waiting for Lucien, who now sat with his friend's hand in his\nown, when he saw Etienne Lousteau turn the door-handle. Lucien\ninstantly dropped Daniel's hand, and told the waiter that he would\ndine at his old place by the counter. D'Arthez gave Lucien a glance of\ndivine kindness, in which reproach was wrapped in forgiveness. The\nglance cut the poet to the quick; he took Daniel's hand and grasped it\nanew.\n\n\"It is an important question of business for me; I will tell you about\nit afterwards,\" said he.\n\nLucien was in his old place by the time that Lousteau reached the\ntable; as the first comer, he greeted his acquaintance; they soon\nstruck up a conversation, which grew so lively that Lucien went off in\nsearch of the manuscript of the _Marguerites_, while Lousteau finished\nhis dinner. He had obtained leave to lay his sonnets before the\njournalist, and mistook the civility of the latter for willingness to\nfind him a publisher, or a place on the paper. When Lucien came\nhurrying back again, he saw d'Arthez resting an elbow on the table in\na corner of the restaurant, and knew that his friend was watching him\nwith melancholy eyes, but he would not see d'Arthez just then; he felt\nthe sharp pangs of poverty, the goadings of ambition, and followed\nLousteau.\n\nIn the late afternoon the journalist and the neophyte went to the\nLuxembourg, and sat down under the trees in that part of the gardens\nwhich lies between the broad Avenue de l'Observatoire and the Rue de\nl'Ouest. The Rue de l'Ouest at that time was a long morass, bounded by\nplanks and market-gardens; the houses were all at the end nearest the\nRue de Vaugirard; and the walk through the gardens was so little\nfrequented, that at the hour when Paris dines, two lovers might fall\nout and exchange the earnest of reconciliation without fear of\nintruders. The only possible spoil-sport was the pensioner on duty at\nthe little iron gate on the Rue de l'Ouest, if that gray-headed\nveteran should take it into his head to lengthen his monotonous beat.\nThere, on a bench beneath the lime-trees, Etienne Lousteau sat and\nlistened to sample-sonnets from the _Marguerites_.\n\nEtienne Lousteau, after a two-years' apprenticeship, was on the staff\nof a newspaper; he had his foot in the stirrup; he reckoned some of\nthe celebrities of the day among his friends; altogether, he was an\nimposing personage in Lucien's eyes. Wherefore, while Lucien untied\nthe string about the _Marguerites_, he judged it necessary to make some\nsort of preface.\n\n\"The sonnet, monsieur,\" said he, \"is one of the most difficult forms\nof poetry. It has fallen almost entirely into disuse. No Frenchman can\nhope to rival Petrarch; for the language in which the Italian wrote,\nbeing so infinitely more pliant than French, lends itself to play of\nthought which our positivism (pardon the use of the expression)\nrejects. So it seemed to me that a volume of sonnets would be\nsomething quite new. Victor Hugo has appropriated the old, Canalis\nwrites lighter verse, Beranger has monopolized songs, Casimir\nDelavigne has taken tragedy, and Lamartine the poetry of meditation.\"\n\n\"Are you a 'Classic' or a 'Romantic'?\" inquired Lousteau.\n\nLucien's astonishment betrayed such complete ignorance of the state of\naffairs in the republic of letters, that Lousteau thought it necessary\nto enlighten him.\n\n\"You have come up in the middle of a pitched battle, my dear fellow;\nyou must make your decision at once. Literature is divided, in the\nfirst place, into several zones, but our great men are ranged in two\nhostile camps. The Royalists are 'Romantics,' the Liberals are\n'Classics.' The divergence of taste in matters literary and divergence\nof political opinion coincide; and the result is a war with weapons of\nevery sort, double-edged witticisms, subtle calumnies and nicknames _a\noutrance_, between the rising and the waning glory, and ink is shed in\ntorrents. The odd part of it is that the Royalist-Romantics are all\nfor liberty in literature, and for repealing laws and conventions;\nwhile the Liberal-Classics are for maintaining the unities, the\nAlexandrine, and the classical theme. So opinions in politics on\neither side are directly at variance with literary taste. If you are\neclectic, you will have no one for you. Which side do you take?\"\n\n\"Which is the winning side?\"\n\n\"The Liberal newspapers have far more subscribers than the Royalist\nand Ministerial journals; still, though Canalis is for Church and\nKing, and patronized by the Court and the clergy, he reaches other\nreaders.--Pshaw! sonnets date back to an epoch before Boileau's time,\"\nsaid Etienne, seeing Lucien's dismay at the prospect of choosing\nbetween two banners. \"Be a Romantic. The Romantics are young men, and\nthe Classics are pedants; the Romantics will gain the day.\"\n\nThe word \"pedant\" was the latest epithet taken up by Romantic\njournalism to heap confusion on the Classical faction.\n\nLucien began to read, choosing first of all the title-sonnets.\n\n\n               EASTER DAISIES.\n\n  The daisies in the meadows, not in vain,\n  In red and white and gold before our eyes,\n  Have written an idyll for man's sympathies,\n  And set his heart's desire in language plain.\n\n  Gold stamens set in silver filigrane\n  Reveal the treasures which we idolize;\n  And all the cost of struggle for the prize\n  Is symboled by a secret blood-red stain.\n\n  Was it because your petals once uncurled\n  When Jesus rose upon a fairer world,\n  And from wings shaken for a heav'nward flight\n  Shed grace, that still as autumn reappears\n  You bloom again to tell of dead delight,\n  To bring us back the flower of twenty years?\n\n\nLucien felt piqued by Lousteau's complete indifference during the\nreading of the sonnet; he was unfamiliar as yet with the disconcerting\nimpassibility of the professional critic, wearied by much reading of\npoetry, prose, and plays. Lucien was accustomed to applause. He choked\ndown his disappointment and read another, a favorite with Mme. de\nBargeton and with some of his friends in the Rue des Quatre-Vents.\n\n\"This one, perhaps, will draw a word from him,\" he thought.\n\n\n               THE MARGUERITE.\n\n  I am the Marguerite, fair and tall I grew\n  In velvet meadows, 'mid the flowers a star.\n  They sought me for my beauty near and far;\n  My dawn, I thought, should be for ever new.\n  But now an all unwished-for gift I rue,\n  A fatal ray of knowledge shed to mar\n  My radiant star-crown grown oracular,\n  For I must speak and give an answer true.\n  An end of silence and of quiet days,\n  The Lover with two words my counsel prays;\n  And when my secret from my heart is reft,\n  When all my silver petals scattered lie,\n  I am the only flower neglected left,\n  Cast down and trodden under foot to die.\n\n\nAt the end, the poet looked up at his Aristarchus. Etienne Lousteau\nwas gazing at the trees in the Pepiniere.\n\n\"Well?\" asked Lucien.\n\n\"Well, my dear fellow, go on! I am listening to you, am I not? That\nfact in itself is as good as praise in Paris.\"\n\n\"Have you had enough?\" Lucien asked.\n\n\"Go on,\" the other answered abruptly enough.\n\nLucien proceeded to read the following sonnet, but his heart was dead\nwithin him; Lousteau's inscrutable composure froze his utterance. If\nhe had come a little further upon the road, he would have known that\nbetween writer and writer silence or abrupt speech, under such\ncircumstances, is a betrayal of jealousy, and outspoken admiration\nmeans a sense of relief over the discovery that the work is not above\nthe average after all.\n\n\n               THE CAMELLIA.\n\n  In Nature's book, if rightly understood,\n  The rose means love, and red for beauty glows;\n  A pure, sweet spirit in the violet blows,\n  And bright the lily gleams in lowlihood.\n\n  But this strange bloom, by sun and wind unwooed,\n  Seems to expand and blossom 'mid the snows,\n  A lily sceptreless, a scentless rose,\n  For dainty listlessness of maidenhood.\n\n  Yet at the opera house the petals trace\n  For modesty a fitting aureole;\n  An alabaster wreath to lay, methought,\n  In dusky hair o'er some fair woman's face\n  Which kindles ev'n such love within the soul\n  As sculptured marble forms by Phidias wrought.\n\n\n\"What do you think of my poor sonnets?\" Lucien asked, coming straight\nto the point.\n\n\"Do you want the truth?\"\n\n\"I am young enough to like the truth, and so anxious to succeed that I\ncan hear it without taking offence, but not without despair,\" replied\nLucien.\n\n\"Well, my dear fellow, the first sonnet, from its involved style, was\nevidently written at Angouleme; it gave you so much trouble, no doubt,\nthat you cannot give it up. The second and third smack of Paris\nalready; but read us one more sonnet,\" he added, with a gesture that\nseemed charming to the provincial.\n\nEncouraged by the request, Lucien read with more confidence, choosing\na sonnet which d'Arthez and Bridau liked best, perhaps on account of\nits color.\n\n\n               THE TULIP.\n\n  I am the Tulip from Batavia's shore;\n  The thrifty Fleming for my beauty rare\n  Pays a king's ransom, when that I am fair,\n  And tall, and straight, and pure my petal's core.\n\n  And, like some Yolande of the days of yore,\n  My long and amply folded skirts I wear,\n  O'er-painted with the blazon that I bear\n  --Gules, a fess azure; purpure, fretty, or.\n\n  The fingers of the Gardener divine\n  Have woven for me my vesture fair and fine,\n  Of threads of sunlight and of purple stain;\n  No flower so glorious in the garden bed,\n  But Nature, woe is me, no fragrance shed\n  Within my cup of Orient porcelain.\n\n\n\"Well?\" asked Lucien after a pause, immeasurably long, as it seemed to\nhim.\n\n\"My dear fellow,\" Etienne said, gravely surveying the tips of Lucien's\nboots (he had brought the pair from Angouleme, and was wearing them\nout). \"My dear fellow, I strongly recommend you to put your ink on\nyour boots to save blacking, and to take your pens for toothpicks, so\nthat when you come away from Flicoteaux's you can swagger along this\npicturesque alley looking as if you had dined. Get a situation of any\nsort or description. Run errands for a bailiff if you have the heart,\nbe a shopman if your back is strong enough, enlist if you happen to\nhave a taste for military music. You have the stuff of three poets in\nyou; but before you can reach your public, you will have time to die\nof starvation six times over, if you intend to live on the proceeds of\nyour poetry, that is. And from your too unsophisticated discourse, it\nwould seem to be your intention to coin money out of your inkstand.\n\n\"I say nothing as to your verses; they are a good deal better than all\nthe poetical wares that are cumbering the ground in booksellers'\nbackshops just now. Elegant 'nightingales' of that sort cost a little\nmore than the others, because they are printed on hand-made paper, but\nthey nearly all of them come down at last to the banks of the Seine.\nYou may study their range of notes there any day if you care to make\nan instructive pilgrimage along the Quais from old Jerome's stall by\nthe Pont Notre Dame to the Pont Royal. You will find them all there\n--all the _Essays in Verse_, the _Inspirations_, the lofty flights,\nthe hymns, and songs, and ballads, and odes; all the nestfuls hatched\nduring the last seven years, in fact. There lie their muses, thick\nwith dust, bespattered by every passing cab, at the mercy of every\nprofane hand that turns them over to look at the vignette on the\ntitle-page.\n\n\"You know nobody; you have access to no newspaper, so your _Marguerites_\nwill remain demurely folded as you hold them now. They will never open\nout to the sun of publicity in fair fields with broad margins enameled\nwith the florets which Dauriat the illustrious, the king of the Wooden\nGalleries, scatters with a lavish hand for poets known to fame. I came\nto Paris as you came, poor boy, with a plentiful stock of illusions,\nimpelled by irrepressible longings for glory--and I found the\nrealities of the craft, the practical difficulties of the trade, the\nhard facts of poverty. In my enthusiasm (it is kept well under control\nnow), my first ebullition of youthful spirits, I did not see the\nsocial machinery at work; so I had to learn to see it by bumping\nagainst the wheels and bruising myself against the shafts, and chains.\nNow you are about to learn, as I learned, that between you and all\nthese fair dreamed-of things lies the strife of men, and passions, and\nnecessities.\n\n\"Willy-nilly, you must take part in a terrible battle; book against\nbook, man against man, party against party; make war you must, and\nthat systematically, or you will be abandoned by your own party. And\nthey are mean contests; struggles which leave you disenchanted, and\nwearied, and depraved, and all in pure waste; for it often happens\nthat you put forth all your strength to win laurels for a man whom you\ndespise, and maintain, in spite of yourself, that some second-rate\nwriter is a genius.\n\n\"There is a world behind the scenes in the theatre of literature. The\npublic in front sees unexpected or well-deserved success, and\napplauds; the public does _not_ see the preparations, ugly as they\nalways are, the painted supers, the _claqueurs_ hired to applaud, the\nstage carpenters, and all that lies behind the scenes. You are still\namong the audience. Abdicate, there is still time, before you set your\nfoot on the lowest step of the throne for which so many ambitious\nspirits are contending, and do not sell your honor, as I do, for a\nlivelihood.\" Etienne's eyes filled with tears as he spoke.\n\n\"Do you know how I make a living?\" he continued passionately. \"The\nlittle stock of money they gave me at home was soon eaten up. A piece\nof mine was accepted at the Theatre-Francais just as I came to an end\nof it. At the Theatre-Francais the influence of a first gentleman of\nthe bedchamber, or of a prince of the blood, would not be enough to\nsecure a turn of favor; the actors only make concessions to those who\nthreaten their self-love. If it is in your power to spread a report\nthat the _jeune premier_ has the asthma, the leading lady a fistula\nwhere you please, and the soubrette has foul breath, then your piece\nwould be played to-morrow. I do not know whether in two years' time, I\nwho speak to you now, shall be in a position to exercise such power.\nYou need so many to back you. And where and how am I to gain my bread\nmeanwhile?\n\n\"I tried lots of things; I wrote a novel, anonymously; old Doguereau\ngave me two hundred francs for it, and he did not make very much out\nof it himself. Then it grew plain to me that journalism alone could\ngive me a living. The next thing was to find my way into those shops.\nI will not tell you all the advances I made, nor how often I begged in\nvain. I will say nothing of the six months I spent as extra hand on a\npaper, and was told that I scared subscribers away, when as a fact I\nattracted them. Pass over the insults I put up with. At this moment I\nam doing the plays at the Boulevard theatres, almost _gratis_, for a\npaper belonging to Finot, that stout young fellow who breakfasts two\nor three times a month, even now, at the Cafe Voltaire (but you don't\ngo there). I live by selling tickets that managers give me to bribe a\ngood word in the paper, and reviewers' copies of books. In short,\nFinot once satisfied, I am allowed to write for and against various\ncommercial articles, and I traffic in tribute paid in kind by various\ntradesmen. A facetious notice of a Carminative Toilet Lotion, _Pate des\nSultanes_, Cephalic Oil, or Brazilian Mixture brings me in twenty or\nthirty francs.\n\n\"I am obliged to dun the publishers when they don't send in a\nsufficient number of reviewers' copies; Finot, as editor, appropriates\ntwo and sells them, and I must have two to sell. If a book of capital\nimportance comes out, and the publisher is stingy with copies, his\nlife is made a burden to him. The craft is vile, but I live by it, and\nso do scores of others. Do not imagine that things are any better in\npublic life. There is corruption everywhere in both regions; every man\nis corrupt or corrupts others. If there is any publishing enterprise\nsomewhat larger than usual afoot, the trade will pay me something to\nbuy neutrality. The amount of my income varies, therefore, directly\nwith the prospectuses. When prospectuses break out like a rash, money\npours into my pockets; I stand treat all round. When trade is dull, I\ndine at Flicoteaux's.\n\n\"Actresses will pay you likewise for praise, but the wiser among them\npay for criticism. To be passed over in silence is what they dread the\nmost; and the very best thing of all, from their point of view, is\ncriticism which draws down a reply; it is far more effectual than bald\npraise, forgotten as soon as read, and it costs more in consequence.\nCelebrity, my dear fellow, is based upon controversy. I am a hired\nbravo; I ply my trade among ideas and reputations, commercial,\nliterary, and dramatic; I make some fifty crowns a month; I can sell a\nnovel for five hundred francs; and I am beginning to be looked upon as\na man to be feared. Some day, instead of living with Florine at the\nexpense of a druggist who gives himself the airs of a lord, I shall be\nin a house of my own; I shall be on the staff of a leading newspaper,\nI shall have a _feuilleton_; and on that day, my dear fellow, Florine\nwill become a great actress. As for me, I am not sure what I shall be\nwhen that time comes, a minister or an honest man--all things are\nstill possible.\"\n\nHe raised his humiliated head, and looked out at the green leaves,\nwith an expression of despairing self-condemnation dreadful to see.\n\n\"And I had a great tragedy accepted!\" he went on. \"And among my papers\nthere is a poem, which will die. And I was a good fellow, and my heart\nwas clean! I used to dream lofty dreams of love for great ladies,\nqueens in the great world; and--my mistress is an actress at the\nPanorama-Dramatique. And lastly, if a bookseller declines to send a\ncopy of a book to my paper, I will run down work which is good, as I\nknow.\"\n\nLucien was moved to tears, and he grasped Etienne's hand in his. The\njournalist rose to his feet, and the pair went up and down the broad\nAvenue de l'Observatoire, as if their lungs craved ampler breathing\nspace.\n\n\"Outside the world of letters,\" Etienne Lousteau continued, \"not a\nsingle creature suspects that every one who succeeds in that world\n--who has a certain vogue, that is to say, or comes into fashion, or\ngains reputation, or renown, or fame, or favor with the public (for by\nthese names we know the rungs of the ladder by which we climb to the\nhigher heights above and beyond them),--every one who comes even thus\nfar is the hero of a dreadful Odyssey. Brilliant portents rise above\nthe mental horizon through a combination of a thousand accidents;\nconditions change so swiftly that no two men have been known to reach\nsuccess by the same road. Canalis and Nathan are two dissimilar cases;\nthings never fall out in the same way twice. There is d'Arthez, who\nknocks himself to pieces with work--he will make a famous name by some\nother chance.\n\n\"This so much desired reputation is nearly always crowned\nprostitution. Yes; the poorest kind of literature is the hapless\ncreature freezing at the street corner; second-rate literature is the\nkept-mistress picked out of the brothels of journalism, and I am her\nbully; lastly, there is lucky literature, the flaunting, insolent\ncourtesan who has a house of her own and pays taxes, who receives\ngreat lords, treating or ill-treating them as she pleases, who has\nliveried servants and a carriage, and can afford to keep greedy\ncreditors waiting. Ah! and for yet others, for me not so very long\nago, for you to-day--she is a white-robed angel with many-colored\nwings, bearing a green palm branch in the one hand, and in the other a\nflaming sword. An angel, something akin to the mythological\nabstraction which lives at the bottom of a well, and to the poor and\nhonest girl who lives a life of exile in the outskirts of the great\ncity, earning every penny with a noble fortitude and in the full light\nof virtue, returning to heaven inviolate of body and soul; unless,\nindeed, she comes to lie at the last, soiled, despoiled, polluted, and\nforgotten, on a pauper's bier. As for the men whose brains are\nencompassed with bronze, whose hearts are still warm under the snows\nof experience, they are found but seldom in the country that lies at\nour feet,\" he added, pointing to the great city seething in the late\nafternoon light.\n\nA vision of d'Arthez and his friends flashed upon Lucien's sight, and\nmade appeal to him for a moment; but Lousteau's appalling lamentation\ncarried him away.\n\n\"They are very few and far between in that great fermenting vat; rare\nas love in love-making, rare as fortunes honestly made in business,\nrare as the journalist whose hands are clean. The experience of the\nfirst man who told me all that I am telling you was thrown away upon\nme, and mine no doubt will be wasted upon you. It is always the same\nold story year after year; the same eager rush to Paris from the\nprovinces; the same, not to say a growing, number of beardless,\nambitious boys, who advance, head erect, and the heart that Princess\nTourandocte of the _Mille et un Jours_--each one of them fain to be her\nPrince Calaf. But never a one of them reads the riddle. One by one\nthey drop, some into the trench where failures lie, some into the mire\nof journalism, some again into the quagmires of the book-trade.\n\n\"They pick up a living, these beggars, what with biographical notices,\npenny-a-lining, and scraps of news for the papers. They become\nbooksellers' hacks for the clear-headed dealers in printed paper, who\nwould sooner take the rubbish that goes off in a fortnight than a\nmasterpiece which requires time to sell. The life is crushed out of\nthe grubs before they reach the butterfly stage. They live by shame\nand dishonor. They are ready to write down a rising genius or to\npraise him to the skies at a word from the pasha of the\n_Constitutionnel_, the _Quotidienne_, or the _Debats_, at a sign from a\npublisher, at the request of a jealous comrade, or (as not seldom\nhappens) simply for a dinner. Some surmount the obstacles, and these\nforget the misery of their early days. I, who am telling you this,\nhave been putting the best that is in me into newspaper articles for\nsix months past for a blackguard who gives them out as his own and has\nsecured a _feuilleton_ in another paper on the strength of them. He has\nnot taken me on as his collaborator, he has not give me so much as a\nfive-franc piece, but I hold out a hand to grasp his when we meet; I\ncannot help myself.\"\n\n\"And why?\" Lucien, asked, indignantly.\n\n\"I may want to put a dozen lines into his _feuilleton_ some day,\"\nLousteau answered coolly. \"In short, my dear fellow, in literature you\nwill not make money by hard work, that is not the secret of success;\nthe point is to exploit the work of somebody else. A newspaper\nproprietor is a contractor, we are the bricklayers. The more mediocre\nthe man, the better his chance of getting on among mediocrities; he\ncan play the toad-eater, put up with any treatment, and flatter all\nthe little base passions of the sultans of literature. There is Hector\nMerlin, who came from Limoges a short time ago; he is writing\npolitical articles already for a Right Centre daily, and he is at work\non our little paper as well. I have seen an editor drop his hat and\nMerlin pick it up. The fellow was careful never to give offence, and\nslipped into the thick of the fight between rival ambitions. I am\nsorry for you. It is as if I saw in you the self that I used to be,\nand sure am I that in one or two years' time you will be what I am\nnow.--You will think that there is some lurking jealousy or personal\nmotive in this bitter counsel, but it is prompted by the despair of a\ndamned soul that can never leave hell.--No one ventures to utter such\nthings as these. You hear the groans of anguish from a man wounded to\nthe heart, crying like a second Job from the ashes, 'Behold my\nsores!'\"\n\n\"But whether I fight upon this field or elsewhere, fight I must,\" said\nLucien.\n\n\"Then, be sure of this,\" returned Lousteau, \"if you have anything in\nyou, the war will know no truce, the best chance of success lies in an\nempty head. The austerity of your conscience, clear as yet, will relax\nwhen you see that a man holds your future in his two hands, when a\nword from such a man means life to you, and he will not say that word.\nFor, believe me, the most brutal bookseller in the trade is not so\ninsolent, so hard-hearted to a newcomer as the celebrity of the day.\nThe bookseller sees a possible loss of money, while the writer of\nbooks dreads a possible rival; the first shows you the door, the\nsecond crushes the life out of you. To do really good work, my boy,\nmeans that you will draw out the energy, sap, and tenderness of your\nnature at every dip of the pen in the ink, to set it forth for the\nworld in passion and sentiment and phrases. Yes; instead of acting,\nyou will write; you will sing songs instead of fighting; you will love\nand hate and live in your books; and then, after all, when you shall\nhave reserved your riches for your style, your gold and purple for\nyour characters, and you yourself are walking the streets of Paris in\nrags, rejoicing in that, rivaling the State Register, you have\nauthorized the existence of beings styled Adolphe, Corinne or\nClarissa, Rene or Manon; when you shall have spoiled your life and\nyour digestion to give life to that creation, then you shall see it\nslandered, betrayed, sold, swept away into the back waters of oblivion\nby journalists, and buried out of sight by your best friends. How can\nyou afford to wait until the day when your creation shall rise again,\nraised from the dead--how? when? and by whom? Take a magnificent book,\nthe _pianto_ of unbelief; _Obermann_ is a solitary wanderer in the desert\nplaces of booksellers' warehouses, he has been a 'nightingale,'\nironically so called, from the very beginning: when will his Easter\ncome? Who knows? Try, to begin with, to find somebody bold enough to\nprint the _Marguerites_; not to pay for them, but simply to print them;\nand you will see some queer things.\"\n\nThe fierce tirade, delivered in every tone of the passionate feeling\nwhich it expressed, fell upon Lucien's spirit like an avalanche, and\nleft a sense of glacial cold. For one moment he stood silent; then, as\nhe felt the terrible stimulating charm of difficulty beginning to work\nupon him, his courage blazed up. He grasped Lousteau's hand.\n\n\"I will triumph!\" he cried aloud.\n\n\"Good!\" said the other, \"one more Christian given over to the wild\nbeasts in the arena.--There is a first-night performance at the\nPanorama-Dramatique, my dear fellow; it doesn't begin till eight, so\nyou can change your coat, come properly dressed in fact, and call for\nme. I am living on the fourth floor above the Cafe Servel, Rue de la\nHarpe. We will go to Dauriat's first of all. You still mean to go on,\ndo you not? Very well, I will introduce you to one of the kings of the\ntrade to-night, and to one or two journalists. We will sup with my\nmistress and several friends after the play, for you cannot count that\ndinner as a meal. Finot will be there, editor and proprietor of my\npaper. As Minette says in the Vaudeville (do you remember?), 'Time is\na great lean creature.' Well, for the like of us, Chance is a great\nlean creature, and must be tempted.\"\n\n\"I shall remember this day as long as I live,\" said Lucien.\n\n\"Bring your manuscript with you, and be careful of your dress, not on\nFlorine's account, but for the booksellers' benefit.\"\n\nThe comrade's good-nature, following upon the poet's passionate\noutcry, as he described the war of letters, moved Lucien quite as\ndeeply as d'Arthez's grave and earnest words on a former occasion. The\nprospect of entering at once upon the strife with men warmed him. In\nhis youth and inexperience he had no suspicion how real were the moral\nevils denounced by the journalist. Nor did he know that he was\nstanding at the parting of two distinct ways, between two systems,\nrepresented by the brotherhood upon one hand, and journalism upon the\nother. The first way was long, honorable, and sure; the second beset\nwith hidden dangers, a perilous path, among muddy channels where\nconscience is inevitably bespattered. The bent of Lucien's character\ndetermined for the shorter way, and the apparently pleasanter way, and\nto snatch at the quickest and promptest means. At this moment he saw\nno difference between d'Arthez's noble friendship and Lousteau's easy\ncomaraderie; his inconstant mind discerned a new weapon in journalism;\nhe felt that he could wield it, so he wished to take it.\n\nHe was dazzled by the offers of this new friend, who had struck a hand\nin his in an easy way, which charmed Lucien. How should he know that\nwhile every man in the army of the press needs friends, every leader\nneeds men. Lousteau, seeing that Lucien was resolute, enlisted him as\na recruit, and hoped to attach him to himself. The relative positions\nof the two were similar--one hoped to become a corporal, the other to\nenter the ranks.\n\nLucien went back gaily to his lodgings. He was as careful over his\ntoilet as on that former unlucky occasion when he occupied the\nMarquise d'Espard's box; but he had learned by this time how to wear\nhis clothes with a better grace. They looked as though they belonged\nto him. He wore his best tightly-fitting, light-colored trousers, and\na dress-coat. His boots, a very elegant pair adorned with tassels, had\ncost him forty francs. His thick, fine, golden hair was scented and\ncrimped into bright, rippling curls. Self-confidence and belief in his\nfuture lighted up his forehead. He paid careful attention to his\nalmost feminine hands, the filbert nails were a spotless pink, and the\nwhite contours of his chin were dazzling by contrast with a black\nsatin stock. Never did a more beautiful youth come down from the hills\nof the Latin Quarter.\n\nGlorious as a Greek god, Lucien took a cab, and reached the Cafe\nServel at a quarter to seven. There the portress gave him some\ntolerably complicated directions for the ascent of four pairs of\nstairs. Provided with these instructions, he discovered, not without\ndifficulty, an open door at the end of a long, dark passage, and in\nanother moment made the acquaintance of the traditional room of the\nLatin Quarter.\n\nA young man's poverty follows him wherever he goes--into the Rue de la\nHarpe as into the Rue de Cluny, into d'Arthez's room, into Chrestien's\nlodging; yet everywhere no less the poverty has its own peculiar\ncharacteristics, due to the idiosyncrasies of the sufferer. Poverty in\nthis case wore a sinister look.\n\nA shabby, cheap carpet lay in wrinkles at the foot of a curtainless\nwalnut-wood bedstead; dingy curtains, begrimed with cigar smoke and\nfumes from a smoky chimney, hung in the windows; a Carcel lamp,\nFlorine's gift, on the chimney-piece, had so far escaped the\npawnbroker. Add a forlorn-looking chest of drawers, and a table\nlittered with papers and disheveled quill pens, and the list of\nfurniture was almost complete. All the books had evidently arrived in\nthe course of the last twenty-four hours; and there was not a single\nobject of any value in the room. In one corner you beheld a collection\nof crushed and flattened cigars, coiled pocket-handkerchiefs, shirts\nwhich had been turned to do double duty, and cravats that had reached\na third edition; while a sordid array of old boots stood gaping in\nanother angle of the room among aged socks worn into lace.\n\nThe room, in short, was a journalist's bivouac, filled with odds and\nends of no value, and the most curiously bare apartment imaginable. A\nscarlet tinder-box glowed among a pile of books on the nightstand. A\nbrace of pistols, a box of cigars, and a stray razor lay upon the\nmantel-shelf; a pair of foils, crossed under a wire mask, hung against\na panel. Three chairs and a couple of armchairs, scarcely fit for the\nshabbiest lodging-house in the street, completed the inventory.\n\nThe dirty, cheerless room told a tale of a restless life and a want of\nself-respect; some one came hither to sleep and work at high pressure,\nstaying no longer than he could help, longing, while he remained, to\nbe out and away. What a difference between this cynical disorder and\nd'Arthez's neat and self-respecting poverty! A warning came with the\nthought of d'Arthez; but Lucien would not heed it, for Etienne made a\njoking remark to cover the nakedness of a reckless life.\n\n\"This is my kennel; I appear in state in the Rue de Bondy, in the new\napartments which our druggist has taken for Florine; we hold the\nhouse-warming this evening.\"\n\nEtienne Lousteau wore black trousers and beautifully-varnished boots;\nhis coat was buttoned up to his chin; he probably meant to change his\nlinen at Florine's house, for his shirt collar was hidden by a velvet\nstock. He was trying to renovate his hat by an application of the\nbrush.\n\n\"Let us go,\" said Lucien.\n\n\"Not yet. I am waiting for a bookseller to bring me some money; I have\nnot a farthing; there will be play, perhaps, and in any case I must\nhave gloves.\"\n\nAs he spoke, the two new friends heard a man's step in the passage\noutside.\n\n\"There he is,\" said Lousteau. \"Now you will see, my dear fellow, the\nshape that Providence takes when he manifests himself to poets. You\nare going to behold Dauriat, the fashionable bookseller of the Quai\ndes Augustins, the pawnbroker, the marine store dealer of the trade,\nthe Norman ex-greengrocer.--Come along, old Tartar!\" shouted Lousteau.\n\n\"Here am I,\" said a voice like a cracked bell.\n\n\"Brought the money with you?\"\n\n\"Money? There is no money now in the trade,\" retorted the other, a\nyoung man who eyed Lucien curiously.\n\n\"_Imprimis_, you owe me fifty francs,\" Lousteau continued.\n\n\"There are two copies of _Travels in Egypt_ here, a marvel, so they say,\nswarming with woodcuts, sure to sell. Finot has been paid for two\nreviews that I am to write for him. _Item_ two works, just out, by\nVictor Ducange, a novelist highly thought of in the Marais. _Item_ a\ncouple of copies of a second work by Paul de Kock, a beginner in the\nsame style. _Item_ two copies of _Yseult of Dole_, a charming provincial\nwork. Total, one hundred francs, my little Barbet.\"\n\nBarbet made a close survey of edges and binding.\n\n\"Oh! they are in perfect condition,\" cried Lousteau. \"The _Travels_ are\nuncut, so is the Paul de Kock, so is the Ducange, so is that other\nthing on the chimney-piece, _Considerations on Symbolism_. I will throw\nthat in; myths weary me to that degree that I will let you have the\nthing to spare myself the sight of the swarms of mites coming out of\nit.\"\n\n\"But,\" asked Lucien, \"how are you going to write your reviews?\"\n\nBarbet, in profound astonishment, stared at Lucien; then he looked at\nEtienne and chuckled.\n\n\"One can see that the gentleman has not the misfortune to be a\nliterary man,\" said he.\n\n\"No, Barbet--no. He is a poet, a great poet; he is going to cut out\nCanalis, and Beranger, and Delavigne. He will go a long way if he does\nnot throw himself into the river, and even so he will get as far as\nthe drag-nets at Saint-Cloud.\"\n\n\"If I had any advice to give the gentleman,\" remarked Barbet, \"it\nwould be to give up poetry and take to prose. Poetry is not wanted on\nthe Quais just now.\"\n\nBarbet's shabby overcoat was fastened by a single button; his collar\nwas greasy; he kept his hat on his head as he spoke; he wore low\nshoes, an open waistcoat gave glimpses of a homely shirt of coarse\nlinen. Good-nature was not wanting in the round countenance, with its\ntwo slits of covetous eyes; but there was likewise the vague\nuneasiness habitual to those who have money to spend and hear constant\napplications for it. Yet, to all appearance, he was plain-dealing and\neasy-natured, his business shrewdness was so well wadded round with\nfat. He had been an assistant until he took a wretched little shop on\nthe Quai des Augustins two years since, and issued thence on his\nrounds among journalists, authors, and printers, buying up free copies\ncheaply, making in such ways some ten or twenty francs daily. Now, he\nhad money saved; he knew instinctively where every man was pressed; he\nhad a keen eye for business. If an author was in difficulties, he\nwould discount a bill given by a publisher at fifteen or twenty per\ncent; then the next day he would go to the publisher, haggle over the\nprice of some work in demand, and pay him with his own bills instead\nof cash. Barbet was something of a scholar; he had had just enough\neducation to make him careful to steer clear of modern poetry and\nmodern romances. He had a liking for small speculations, for books of\na popular kind which might be bought outright for a thousand francs\nand exploited at pleasure, such as the _Child's History of France_,\n_Book-keeping in Twenty Lessons_, and _Botany for Young Ladies_. Two\nor three times already he had allowed a good book to slip through his\nfingers; the authors had come and gone a score of times while he\nhesitated, and could not make up his mind to buy the manuscript. When\nreproached for his pusillanimity, he was wont to produce the account\nof a notorious trial taken from the newspapers; it cost him nothing,\nand had brought him in two or three thousand francs.\n\nBarbet was the type of bookseller that goes in fear and trembling;\nlives on bread and walnuts; rarely puts his name to a bill; filches\nlittle profits on invoices; makes deductions, and hawks his books\nabout himself; heaven only knows where they go, but he sells them\nsomehow, and gets paid for them. Barbet was the terror of printers,\nwho could not tell what to make of him; he paid cash and took off the\ndiscount; he nibbled at their invoices whenever he thought they were\npressed for money; and when he had fleeced a man once, he never went\nback to him--he feared to be caught in his turn.\n\n\"Well,\" said Lousteau, \"shall we go on with our business?\"\n\n\"Eh! my boy,\" returned Barbet in a familiar tone; \"I have six thousand\nvolumes of stock on hand at my place, and paper is not gold, as the\nold bookseller said. Trade is dull.\"\n\n\"If you went into his shop, my dear Lucien,\" said Etienne, turning to\nhis friend, \"you would see an oak counter from some bankrupt wine\nmerchant's sale, and a tallow dip, never snuffed for fear it should\nburn too quickly, making darkness visible. By that anomalous light you\ndescry rows of empty shelves with some difficulty. An urchin in a blue\nblouse mounts guard over the emptiness, and blows his fingers, and\nshuffles his feet, and slaps his chest, like a cabman on the box. Just\nlook about you! there are no more books there than I have here. Nobody\ncould guess what kind of shop he keeps.\"\n\n\"Here is a bill at three months for a hundred francs,\" said Barbet,\nand he could not help smiling as he drew it out of his pocket; \"I will\ntake your old books off your hands. I can't pay cash any longer, you\nsee; sales are too slow. I thought that you would be wanting me; I had\nnot a penny, and I made a bill simply to oblige you, for I am not fond\nof giving my signature.\"\n\n\"So you want my thanks and esteem into the bargain, do you?\"\n\n\"Bills are not met with sentiment,\" responded Barbet; \"but I will\naccept your esteem, all the same.\"\n\n\"But I want gloves, and the perfumers will be base enough to decline\nyour paper,\" said Lousteau. \"Stop, there is a superb engraving in the\ntop drawer of the chest there, worth eighty francs, proof before\nletters and after letterpress, for I have written a pretty droll\narticle upon it. There was something to lay hold of in _Hippocrates\nrefusing the Presents of Artaxerxes_. A fine engraving, eh? Just the\nthing to suit all the doctors, who are refusing the extravagant gifts\nof Parisian satraps. You will find two or three dozen novels\nunderneath it. Come, now, take the lot and give me forty francs.\"\n\n\"_Forty francs_!\" exclaimed the bookseller, emitting a cry like the\nsquall of a frightened fowl. \"Twenty at the very most! And then I may\nnever see the money again,\" he added.\n\n\"Where are your twenty francs?\" asked Lousteau.\n\n\"My word, I don't know that I have them,\" said Barbet, fumbling in his\npockets. \"Here they are. You are plundering me; you have an ascendency\nover me----\"\n\n\"Come, let us be off,\" said Lousteau, and taking up Lucien's\nmanuscript, he drew a line upon it in ink under the string.\n\n\"Have you anything else?\" asked Barbet.\n\n\"Nothing, you young Shylock. I am going to put you in the way of a bit\nof very good business,\" Etienne continued (\"in which you shall lose a\nthousand crowns, to teach you to rob me in this fashion\"), he added\nfor Lucien's ear.\n\n\"But how about your reviews?\" said Lucien, as they rolled away to the\nPalais Royal.\n\n\"Pooh! you do not know how reviews are knocked off. As for the _Travels\nin Egypt_, I looked into the book here and there (without cutting the\npages), and I found eleven slips in grammar. I shall say that the\nwriter may have mastered the dicky-bird language on the flints that\nthey call 'obelisks' out there in Egypt, but he cannot write in his\nown, as I will prove to him in a column and a half. I shall say that\ninstead of giving us the natural history and archaeology, he ought to\nhave interested himself in the future of Egypt, in the progress of\ncivilization, and the best method of strengthening the bond between\nEgypt and France. France has won and lost Egypt, but she may yet\nattach the country to her interests by gaining a moral ascendency over\nit. Then some patriotic penny-a-lining, interlarded with diatribes on\nMarseilles, the Levant and our trade.\"\n\n\"But suppose that he had taken that view, what would you do?\"\n\n\"Oh well, I should say that instead of boring us with politics, he\nshould have written about art, and described the picturesque aspects\nof the country and the local color. Then the critic bewails himself.\nPolitics are intruded everywhere; we are weary of politics--politics\non all sides. I should regret those charming books of travel that\ndwelt upon the difficulties of navigation, the fascination of steering\nbetween two rocks, the delights of crossing the line, and all the\nthings that those who never will travel ought to know. Mingle this\napproval with scoffing at the travelers who hail the appearance of a\nbird or a flying-fish as a great event, who dilate upon fishing, and\nmake transcripts from the log. Where, you ask, is that perfectly\nunintelligible scientific information, fascinating, like all that is\nprofound, mysterious, and incomprehensible. The reader laughs, that is\nall that he wants. As for novels, Florine is the greatest novel reader\nalive; she gives me a synopsis, and I take her opinion and put a\nreview together. When a novelist bores her with 'author's stuff,' as\nshe calls it, I treat the work respectfully, and ask the publisher for\nanother copy, which he sends forthwith, delighted to have a favorable\nreview.\"\n\n\"Goodness! and what of criticism, the critic's sacred office?\" cried\nLucien, remembering the ideas instilled into him by the brotherhood.\n\n\"My dear fellow,\" said Lousteau, \"criticism is a kind of brush which\nmust not be used upon flimsy stuff, or it carries it all away with it.\nThat is enough of the craft, now listen! Do you see that mark?\" he\ncontinued, pointing to the manuscript of the _Marguerites_. \"I have put\nink on the string and paper. If Dauriat reads your manuscript, he\ncertainly could not tie the string and leave it just as it was before.\nSo your book is sealed, so to speak. This is not useless to you for\nthe experiment that you propose to make. And another thing: please to\nobserve that you are not arriving quite alone and without a sponsor in\nthe place, like the youngsters who make the round of half-a-score of\npublishers before they find one that will offer them a chair.\"\n\nLucien's experience confirmed the truth of this particular. Lousteau\npaid the cabman, giving him three francs--a piece of prodigality\nfollowing upon such impecuniosity astonishing Lucien more than a\nlittle. Then the two friends entered the Wooden Galleries, where\nfashionable literature, as it is called, used to reign in state.\n\n\n\n                                PART II\n\nThe Wooden Galleries of the Palais Royal used to be one of the most\nfamous sights of Paris. Some description of the squalid bazar will not\nbe out of place; for there are few men of forty who will not take an\ninterest in recollections of a state of things which will seem\nincredible to a younger generation.\n\nThe great dreary, spacious Galerie d'Orleans, that flowerless\nhothouse, as yet was not; the space upon which it now stands was\ncovered with booths; or, to be more precise, with small, wooden dens,\npervious to the weather, and dimly illuminated on the side of the\ncourt and the garden by borrowed lights styled windows by courtesy,\nbut more like the filthiest arrangements for obscuring daylight to be\nfound in little wineshops in the suburbs.\n\nThe Galleries, parallel passages about twelve feet in height, were\nformed by a triple row of shops. The centre row, giving back and front\nupon the Galleries, was filled with the fetid atmosphere of the place,\nand derived a dubious daylight through the invariably dirty windows of\nthe roof; but so thronged were these hives, that rents were\nexcessively high, and as much as a thousand crowns was paid for a\nspace scarce six feet by eight. The outer rows gave respectively upon\nthe garden and the court, and were covered on that side by a slight\ntrellis-work painted green, to protect the crazy plastered walls from\ncontinual friction with the passers-by. In a few square feet of earth\nat the back of the shops, strange freaks of vegetable life unknown to\nscience grew amid the products of various no less flourishing\nindustries. You beheld a rosebush capped with printed paper in such a\nsort that the flowers of rhetoric were perfumed by the cankered\nblossoms of that ill-kept, ill-smelling garden. Handbills and ribbon\nstreamers of every hue flaunted gaily among the leaves; natural\nflowers competed unsuccessfully for an existence with odds and ends of\nmillinery. You discovered a knot of ribbon adorning a green tuft; the\ndahlia admired afar proved on a nearer view to be a satin rosette.\n\nThe Palais seen from the court or from the garden was a fantastic\nsight, a grotesque combination of walls of plaster patchwork which had\nonce been whitewashed, of blistered paint, heterogeneous placards, and\nall the most unaccountable freaks of Parisian squalor; the green\ntrellises were prodigiously the dingier for constant contact with a\nParisian public. So, upon either side, the fetid, disreputable\napproaches might have been there for the express purpose of warning\naway fastidious people; but fastidious folk no more recoiled before\nthese horrors than the prince in the fairy stories turns tail at sight\nof the dragon or of the other obstacles put between him and the\nprincess by the wicked fairy.\n\nThere was a passage through the centre of the Galleries then as now;\nand, as at the present day, you entered them through the two\nperistyles begun before the Revolution, and left unfinished for lack\nof funds; but in place of the handsome modern arcade leading to the\nTheatre-Francais, you passed along a narrow, disproportionately lofty\npassage, so ill-roofed that the rain came through on wet days. All the\nroofs of the hovels indeed were in very bad repair, and covered here\nand again with a double thickness of tarpaulin. A famous silk mercer\nonce brought an action against the Orleans family for damages done in\nthe course of a night to his stock of shawls and stuffs, and gained\nthe day and a considerable sum. It was in this last-named passage,\ncalled \"The Glass Gallery\" to distinguish it from the Wooden\nGalleries, that Chevet laid the foundations of his fortunes.\n\nHere, in the Palais, you trod the natural soil of Paris, augmented by\nimportations brought in upon the boots of foot passengers; here, at\nall seasons, you stumbled among hills and hollows of dried mud swept\ndaily by the shopman's besom, and only after some practice could you\nwalk at your ease. The treacherous mud-heaps, the window-panes\nincrusted with deposits of dust and rain, the mean-looking hovels\ncovered with ragged placards, the grimy unfinished walls, the general\nair of a compromise between a gypsy camp, the booths of a country\nfair, and the temporary structures that we in Paris build round about\npublic monuments that remain unbuilt; the grotesque aspect of the mart\nas a whole was in keeping with the seething traffic of various kinds\ncarried on within it; for here in this shameless, unblushing haunt,\namid wild mirth and a babel of talk, an immense amount of business was\ntransacted between the Revolution of 1789 and the Revolution of 1830.\n\nFor twenty years the Bourse stood just opposite, on the ground floor\nof the Palais. Public opinion was manufactured, and reputations made\nand ruined here, just as political and financial jobs were arranged.\nPeople made appointments to meet in the Galleries before or after\n'Change; on showery days the Palais Royal was often crowded with\nweather-bound capitalists and men of business. The structure which had\ngrown up, no one knew how, about this point was strangely resonant,\nlaughter was multiplied; if two men quarreled, the whole place rang\nfrom one end to the other with the dispute. In the daytime milliners\nand booksellers enjoyed a monopoly of the place; towards nightfall it\nwas filled with women of the town. Here dwelt poetry, politics, and\nprose, new books and classics, the glories of ancient and modern\nliterature side by side with political intrigue and the tricks of the\nbookseller's trade. Here all the very latest and newest literature\nwere sold to a public which resolutely decline to buy elsewhere.\nSometimes several thousand copies of such and such a pamphlet by\nPaul-Louis Courier would be sold in a single evening; and people\ncrowded thither to buy _Les aventures de la fille d'un Roi_--that\nfirst shot fired by the Orleanists at The Charter promulgated by\nLouis XVIII.\n\nWhen Lucien made his first appearance in the Wooden Galleries, some\nfew of the shops boasted proper fronts and handsome windows, but these\nin every case looked upon the court or the garden. As for the centre\nrow, until the day when the whole strange colony perished under the\nhammer of Fontaine the architect, every shop was open back and front\nlike a booth in a country fair, so that from within you could look out\nupon either side through gaps among the goods displayed or through the\nglass doors. As it was obviously impossible to kindle a fire, the\ntradesmen were fain to use charcoal chafing-dishes, and formed a sort\nof brigade for the prevention of fires among themselves; and, indeed,\na little carelessness might have set the whole quarter blazing in\nfifteen minutes, for the plank-built republic, dried by the heat of\nthe sun, and haunted by too inflammable human material, was bedizened\nwith muslin and paper and gauze, and ventilated at times by a thorough\ndraught.\n\nThe milliners' windows were full of impossible hats and bonnets,\ndisplayed apparently for advertisement rather than for sale, each on a\nseparate iron spit with a knob at the top. The galleries were decked\nout in all the colors of the rainbow. On what heads would those dusty\nbonnets end their careers?--for a score of years the problem had\npuzzled frequenters of the Palais. Saleswomen, usually plain-featured,\nbut vivacious, waylaid the feminine foot passenger with cunning\nimportunities, after the fashion of market-women, and using much the\nsame language; a shop-girl, who made free use of her eyes and tongue,\nsat outside on a stool and harangued the public with \"Buy a pretty\nbonnet, madame?--Do let me sell you something!\"--varying a rich and\npicturesque vocabulary with inflections of the voice, with glances,\nand remarks upon the passers-by. Booksellers and milliners lived on\nterms of mutual understanding.\n\nBut it was in the passage known by the pompous title of the \"Glass\nGallery\" that the oddest trades were carried on. Here were\nventriloquists and charlatans of every sort, and sights of every\ndescription, from the kind where there is nothing to see to panoramas\nof the globe. One man who has since made seven or eight hundred\nthousand francs by traveling from fair to fair began here by hanging\nout a signboard, a revolving sun in a blackboard, and the inscription\nin red letters: \"Here Man may see what God can never see. Admittance,\ntwo sous.\" The showman at the door never admitted one person alone,\nnor more than two at a time. Once inside, you confronted a great\nlooking-glass; and a voice, which might have terrified Hoffmann of\nBerlin, suddenly spoke as if some spring had been touched, \"You see\nhere, gentlemen, something that God can never see through all\neternity, that is to say, your like. God has not His like.\" And out\nyou went, too shamefaced to confess to your stupidity.\n\nVoices issued from every narrow doorway, crying up the merits of\nCosmoramas, views of Constantinople, marionettes, automatic\nchess-players, and performing dogs who would pick you out the prettiest\nwoman in the company. The ventriloquist Fritz-James flourished here in\nthe Cafe Borel before he went to fight and fall at Montmartre with the\nyoung lads from the Ecole polytechnique. Here, too, there were fruit\nand flower shops, and a famous tailor whose gold-laced uniforms shone\nlike the sun when the shops were lighted at night.\n\nOf a morning the galleries were empty, dark, and deserted; the\nshopkeepers chatted among themselves. Towards two o'clock in the\nafternoon the Palais began to fill; at three, men came in from the\nBourse, and Paris, generally speaking, crowded the place. Impecunious\nyouth, hungering after literature, took the opportunity of turning\nover the pages of the books exposed for sale on the stalls outside the\nbooksellers' shops; the men in charge charitably allowed a poor\nstudent to pursue his course of free studies; and in this way a\nduodecimo volume of some two hundred pages, such as _Smarra_ or _Pierre\nSchlemihl_, or _Jean Sbogar_ or _Jocko_, might be devoured in a couple of\nafternoons. There was something very French in this alms given to the\nyoung, hungry, starved intellect. Circulating libraries were not as\nyet; if you wished to read a book, you were obliged to buy it, for\nwhich reason novels of the early part of the century were sold in\nnumbers which now seem well-nigh fabulous to us.\n\nBut the poetry of this terrible mart appeared in all its splendor at\nthe close of the day. Women of the town, flocking in and out from the\nneighboring streets, were allowed to make a promenade of the Wooden\nGalleries. Thither came prostitutes from every quarter of Paris to \"do\nthe Palais.\" The Stone Galleries belonged to privileged houses, which\npaid for the right of exposing women dressed like princesses under\nsuch and such an arch, or in the corresponding space of garden; but\nthe Wooden Galleries were the common ground of women of the streets.\nThis was _the_ Palais, a word which used to signify the temple of\nprostitution. A woman might come and go, taking away her prey\nwhithersoever seemed good to her. So great was the crowd attracted\nthither at night by the women, that it was impossible to move except\nat a slow pace, as in a procession or at a masked ball. Nobody\nobjected to the slowness; it facilitated examination. The women\ndressed in a way that is never seen nowadays. The bodices cut\nextremely low both back and front; the fantastical head-dresses,\ndesigned to attract notice; here a cap from the Pays de Caux, and\nthere a Spanish mantilla; the hair crimped and curled like a poodle's,\nor smoothed down in bandeaux over the forehead; the close-fitting\nwhite stockings and limbs, revealed it would not be easy to say how,\nbut always at the right moment--all this poetry of vice has fled. The\nlicense of question and reply, the public cynicism in keeping with the\nhaunt, is now unknown even at masquerades or the famous public balls.\nIt was an appalling, gay scene. The dazzling white flesh of the\nwomen's necks and shoulders stood out in magnificent contrast against\nthe men's almost invariably sombre costumes. The murmur of voices, the\nhum of the crowd, could be heard even in the middle of the garden as a\nsort of droning bass, interspersed with _fioriture_ of shrill laughter\nor clamor of some rare dispute. You saw gentlemen and celebrities\ncheek by jowl with gallows-birds. There was something indescribably\npiquant about the anomalous assemblage; the most insensible of men\nfelt its charm, so much so, that, until the very last moment, Paris\ncame hither to walk up and down on the wooden planks laid over the\ncellars where men were at work on the new buildings; and when the\nsqualid wooden erections were finally taken down, great and unanimous\nregret was felt.\n\nLadvocat the bookseller had opened a shop but a few days since in the\nangle formed by the central passage which crossed the galleries; and\nimmediately opposite another bookseller, now forgotten, Dauriat, a\nbold and youthful pioneer, who opened up the paths in which his rival\nwas to shine. Dauriat's shop stood in the row which gave upon the\ngarden; Ladvocat's, on the opposite side, looked out upon the court.\nDauriat's establishment was divided into two parts; his shop was\nsimply a great trade warehouse, and the second room was his private\noffice.\n\nLucien, on this first visit to the Wooden Galleries, was bewildered by\na sight which no novice can resist. He soon lost the guide who\nbefriended him.\n\n\"If you were as good-looking as yonder young fellow, I would give you\nyour money's worth,\" a woman said, pointing out Lucien to an old man.\n\nLucien slunk through the crowd like a blind man's dog, following the\nstream in a state of stupefaction and excitement difficult to\ndescribe. Importuned by glances and white-rounded contours, dazzled by\nthe audacious display of bared throat and bosom, he gripped his roll\nof manuscript tightly lest somebody should steal it--innocent that he\nwas!\n\n\"Well, what is it, sir!\" he exclaimed, thinking, when some one caught\nhim by the arm, that his poetry had proved too great a temptation to\nsome author's honesty, and turning, he recognized Lousteau.\n\n\"I felt sure that you would find your way here at last,\" said his\nfriend.\n\nThe poet was standing in the doorway of a shop crowded with persons\nwaiting for an audience with the sultan of the publishing trade.\nPrinters, paper-dealers, and designers were catechizing Dauriat's\nassistants as to present or future business.\n\nLousteau drew Lucien into the shop. \"There! that is Finot who edits my\npaper,\" he said; \"he is talking with Felicien Vernou, who has\nabilities, but the little wretch is as dangerous as a hidden disease.\"\n\n\"Well, old boy, there is a first night for you,\" said Finot, coming up\nwith Vernou. \"I have disposed of the box.\"\n\n\"Sold it to Braulard?\"\n\n\"Well, and if I did, what then? You will get a seat. What do you want\nwith Dauriat? Oh, it is agreed that we are to push Paul de Kock,\nDauriat has taken two hundred copies, and Victor Ducange is refusing\nto give him his next. Dauriat wants to set up another man in the same\nline, he says. You must rate Paul de Kock above Ducange.\"\n\n\"But I have a piece on with Ducange at the Gaite,\" said Lousteau.\n\n\"Very well, tell him that I wrote the article. It can be supposed that\nI wrote a slashing review, and you toned it down; and he will owe you\nthanks.\"\n\n\"Couldn't you get Dauriat's cashier to discount this bit of a bill for\na hundred francs?\" asked Etienne Lousteau. \"We are celebrating\nFlorine's house-warming with a supper to-night, you know.\"\n\n\"Ah! yes, you are treating us all,\" said Finot, with an apparent\neffort of memory. \"Here, Gabusson,\" he added, handing Barbet's bill to\nthe cashier, \"let me have ninety francs for this individual.--Fill in\nyour name, old man.\"\n\nLousteau signed his name while the cashier counted out the money; and\nLucien, all eyes and ears, lost not a syllable of the conversation.\n\n\"That is not all, my friend,\" Etienne continued; \"I don't thank you,\nwe have sworn an eternal friendship. I have taken it upon myself to\nintroduce this gentleman to Dauriat, and you must incline his ear to\nlisten to us.\"\n\n\"What is on foot?\" asked Finot.\n\n\"A volume of poetry,\" said Lucien.\n\n\"Oh!\" said Finot, with a shrug of the shoulders.\n\n\"Your acquaintance cannot have had much to do with publishers, or he\nwould have hidden his manuscript in the loneliest spot in his\ndwelling,\" remarked Vernou, looking at Lucien as he spoke.\n\nJust at that moment a good-looking young man came into the shop, gave\na hand to Finot and Lousteau, and nodded slightly to Vernou. The\nnewcomer was Emile Blondet, who had made his first appearance in the\n_Journal des Debats_, with articles revealing capacities of the very\nhighest order.\n\n\"Come and have supper with us at midnight, at Florine's,\" said\nLousteau.\n\n\"Very good,\" said the newcomer. \"But who is going to be there?\"\n\n\"Oh, Florine and Matifat the druggist,\" said Lousteau, \"and du Bruel,\nthe author who gave Florine the part in which she is to make her first\nappearance, a little old fogy named Cardot, and his son-in-law\nCamusot, and Finot, and----\"\n\n\"Does your druggist do things properly?\"\n\n\"He will not give us doctored wine,\" said Lucien.\n\n\"You are very witty, monsieur,\" Blondet returned gravely. \"Is he\ncoming, Lousteau?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then we shall have some fun.\"\n\nLucien had flushed red to the tips of his ears. Blondet tapped on the\nwindow above Dauriat's desk.\n\n\"Is your business likely to keep you long, Dauriat?\"\n\n\"I am at your service, my friend.\"\n\n\"That's right,\" said Lousteau, addressing his protege. \"That young\nfellow is hardly any older than you are, and he is on the _Debats_! He\nis one of the princes of criticism. They are afraid of him, Dauriat\nwill fawn upon him, and then we can put in a word about our business\nwith the pasha of vignettes and type. Otherwise we might have waited\ntill eleven o'clock, and our turn would not have come. The crowd of\npeople waiting to speak with Dauriat is growing bigger every moment.\"\n\nLucien and Lousteau followed Blondet, Finot, and Vernou, and stood in\na knot at the back of the shop.\n\n\"What is he doing?\" asked Blondet of the head-clerk, who rose to bid\nhim good-evening.\n\n\"He is buying a weekly newspaper. He wants to put new life into it,\nand set up a rival to the _Minerve_ and the _Conservateur_; Eymery has\nrather too much of his own way in the _Minerve_, and the _Conservateur_ is\ntoo blindly Romantic.\"\n\n\"Is he going to pay well?\"\n\n\"Only too much--as usual,\" said the cashier.\n\nJust as he spoke another young man entered; this was the writer of a\nmagnificent novel which had sold very rapidly and met with the\ngreatest possible success. Dauriat was bringing out a second edition.\nThe appearance of this odd and extraordinary looking being, so\nunmistakably an artist, made a deep impression on Lucien's mind.\n\n\"That is Nathan,\" Lousteau said in his ear.\n\nNathan, then in the prime of his youth, came up to the group of\njournalists, hat in hand; and in spite of his look of fierce pride he\nwas almost humble to Blondet, whom as yet he only knew by sight.\nBlondet did not remove his hat, neither did Finot.\n\n\"Monsieur, I am delighted to avail myself of an opportunity yielded by\nchance----\"\n\n(\"He is so nervous that he is committing a pleonasm,\" said Felicien in\nan aside to Lousteau.)\n\n\"----to give expression to my gratitude for the splendid review which\nyou were so good as to give me in the _Journal des Debats_. Half the\nsuccess of my book is owing to you.\"\n\n\"No, my dear fellow, no,\" said Blondet, with an air of patronage\nscarcely masked by good-nature. \"You have talent, the deuce you have,\nand I'm delighted to make your acquaintance.\"\n\n\"Now that your review has appeared, I shall not seem to be courting\npower; we can feel at ease. Will you do me the honor and the pleasure\nof dining with me to-morrow? Finot is coming.--Lousteau, old man, you\nwill not refuse me, will you?\" added Nathan, shaking Etienne by the\nhand.--\"Ah, you are on the way to a great future, monsieur,\" he added,\nturning again to Blondet; \"you will carry on the line of Dussaults,\nFievees, and Geoffrois! Hoffmann was talking about you to a friend of\nmine, Claude Vignon, his pupil; he said that he could die in peace,\nthe _Journal des Debats_ would live forever. They ought to pay you\ntremendously well.\"\n\n\"A hundred francs a column,\" said Blondet. \"Poor pay when one is\nobliged to read the books, and read a hundred before you find one\nworth interesting yourself in, like yours. Your work gave me pleasure,\nupon my word.\"\n\n\"And brought him in fifteen hundred francs,\" said Lousteau for\nLucien's benefit.\n\n\"But you write political articles, don't you?\" asked Nathan.\n\n\"Yes; now and again.\"\n\nLucien felt like an embryo among these men; he had admired Nathan's\nbook, he had reverenced the author as an immortal; Nathan's abject\nattitude before this critic, whose name and importance were both\nunknown to him, stupefied Lucien.\n\n\"How if I should come to behave as he does?\" he thought. \"Is a man\nobliged to part with his self-respect?--Pray put on your hat again,\nNathan; you have written a great book, and the critic has only written\na review of it.\"\n\nThese thoughts set the blood tingling in his veins. Scarce a minute\npassed but some young author, poverty-stricken and shy, came in, asked\nto speak with Dauriat, looked round the crowded shop despairingly, and\nwent out saying, \"I will come back again.\" Two or three politicians\nwere chatting over the convocation of the Chambers and public business\nwith a group of well-known public men. The weekly newspaper for which\nDauriat was in treaty was licensed to treat of matters political, and\nthe number of newspapers suffered to exist was growing smaller and\nsmaller, till a paper was a piece of property as much in demand as a\ntheatre. One of the largest shareholders in the _Constitutionnel_ was\nstanding in the midst of the knot of political celebrities. Lousteau\nperformed the part of cicerone to admiration; with every sentence he\nuttered Dauriat rose higher in Lucien's opinion. Politics and\nliterature seemed to converge in Dauriat's shop. He had seen a great\npoet prostituting his muse to journalism, humiliating Art, as woman\nwas humiliated and prostituted in those shameless galleries without,\nand the provincial took a terrible lesson to heart. Money! That was\nthe key to every enigma. Lucien realized the fact that he was unknown\nand alone, and that the fragile clue of an uncertain friendship was\nhis sole guide to success and fortune. He blamed the kind and loyal\nlittle circle for painting the world for him in false colors, for\npreventing him from plunging into the arena, pen in hand. \"I should be\na Blondet at this moment!\" he exclaimed within himself.\n\nOnly a little while ago they had sat looking out over Paris from the\nGardens of the Luxembourg, and Lousteau had uttered the cry of a\nwounded eagle; then Lousteau had been a great man in Lucien's eyes,\nand now he had shrunk to scarce visible proportions. The really\nimportant man for him at this moment was the fashionable bookseller,\nby whom all these men lived; and the poet, manuscript in hand, felt a\nnervous tremor that was almost like fear. He noticed a group of busts\nmounted on wooden pedestals, painted to resemble marble; Byron stood\nthere, and Goethe and M. de Canalis. Dauriat was hoping to publish a\nvolume by the last-named poet, who might see, on his entrance into the\nshop, the estimation in which he was held by the trade. Unconsciously\nLucien's own self-esteem began to shrink, and his courage ebbed. He\nbegan to see how large a part this Dauriat would play in his\ndestinies, and waited impatiently for him to appear.\n\n\"Well, children,\" said a voice, and a short, stout man appeared, with\na puffy face that suggested a Roman pro-consul's visage, mellowed by\nan air of good-nature which deceived superficial observers. \"Well,\nchildren, here am I, the proprietor of the only weekly paper in the\nmarket, a paper with two thousand subscribers!\"\n\n\"Old joker! The registered number is seven hundred, and that is over\nthe mark,\" said Blondet.\n\n\"Twelve thousand, on my sacred word of honor--I said two thousand for\nthe benefit of the printers and paper-dealers yonder,\" he added,\nlowering his voice, then raising it again. \"I thought you had more\ntact, my boy,\" he added.\n\n\"Are you going to take any partners?\" inquired Finot.\n\n\"That depends,\" said Dauriat. \"Will you take a third at forty thousand\nfrancs?\"\n\n\"It's a bargain, if you will take Emile Blondet here on the staff, and\nClaude Vignon, Scribe, Theodore Leclercq, Felicien Vernou, Jay, Jouy,\nLousteau, and----\"\n\n\"And why not Lucien de Rubempre?\" the provincial poet put in boldly.\n\n\"----and Nathan,\" concluded Finot.\n\n\"Why not the people out there in the street?\" asked Dauriat, scowling\nat the author of the _Marguerites_.--\"To whom have I the honor of\nspeaking?\" he added, with an insolent glance.\n\n\"One moment, Dauriat,\" said Lousteau. \"I have brought this gentleman\nto you. Listen to me, while Finot is thinking over your proposals.\"\n\nLucien watched this Dauriat, who addressed Finot with the familiar tu,\nwhich even Finot did not permit himself to use in reply; who called\nthe redoubtable Blondet \"my boy,\" and extended a hand royally to\nNathan with a friendly nod. The provincial poet felt his shirt wet\nwith perspiration when the formidable sultan looked indifferent and\nill pleased.\n\n\"Another piece of business, my boy!\" exclaimed Dauriat. \"Why, I have\neleven hundred manuscripts on hand, as you know! Yes, gentlemen, I\nhave eleven hundred manuscripts submitted to me at this moment; ask\nGabusson. I shall soon be obliged to start a department to keep\naccount of the stock of manuscripts, and a special office for reading\nthem, and a committee to vote on their merits, with numbered counters\nfor those who attend, and a permanent secretary to draw up the minutes\nfor me. It will be a kind of local branch of the Academie, and the\nAcademicians will be better paid in the Wooden Galleries than at the\nInstitut.\"\n\n\"'Tis an idea,\" said Blondet.\n\n\"A bad idea,\" returned Dauriat. \"It is not my business to take stock\nof the lucubrations of those among you who take to literature because\nthey cannot be capitalists, and there is no opening for them as\nbootmakers, nor corporals, nor domestic servants, nor officials, nor\nbailiffs. Nobody comes here until he has made a name for himself! Make\na name for yourself, and you will find gold in torrents. I have made\nthree great men in the last two years; and lo and behold three\nexamples of ingratitude! Here is Nathan talking of six thousand francs\nfor the second edition of his book, which cost me three thousand\nfrancs in reviews, and has not brought in a thousand yet. I paid a\nthousand francs for Blondet's two articles, besides a dinner, which\ncost me five hundred----\"\n\n\"But if all booksellers talked as you do, sir, how could a man publish\nhis first book at all?\" asked Lucien. Blondet had gone down\ntremendously in his opinion since he had heard the amount given by\nDauriat for the articles in the _Debats_.\n\n\"That is not my affair,\" said Dauriat, looking daggers at this\nhandsome young fellow, who was smiling pleasantly at him. \"I do not\npublish books for amusement, nor risk two thousand francs for the sake\nof seeing my money back again. I speculate in literature, and publish\nforty volumes of ten thousand copies each, just as Panckouke does and\nthe Baudoins. With my influence and the articles which I secure, I can\npush a business of a hundred thousand crowns, instead of a single\nvolume involving a couple of thousand francs. It is just as much\ntrouble to bring out a new name and to induce the public to take up an\nauthor and his book, as to make a success with the _Theatres etrangers_,\n_Victoires et Conquetes_, or _Memoires sur la Revolution_, books that\nbring in a fortune. I am not here as a stepping-stone to future fame,\nbut to make money, and to find it for men with distinguished names.\nThe manuscripts for which I give a hundred thousand francs pay me\nbetter than work by an unknown author who asks six hundred. If I am\nnot exactly a Maecenas, I deserve the gratitude of literature; I have\ndoubled the prices of manuscripts. I am giving you this explanation\nbecause you are a friend of Lousteau's my boy,\" added Dauriat,\nclapping Lucien on the shoulder with odious familiarity. \"If I were to\ntalk to all the authors who have a mind that I should be their\npublisher, I should have to shut up shop; I should pass my time very\nagreeably no doubt, but the conversations would cost too much. I am\nnot rich enough yet to listen to all the monologues of self-conceit.\nNobody does, except in classical tragedies on the stage.\"\n\nThe terrible Dauriat's gorgeous raiment seemed in the provincial\npoet's eyes to add force to the man's remorseless logic.\n\n\"What is it about?\" he continued, addressing Lucien's protector.\n\n\"It is a volume of magnificent poetry.\"\n\nAt that word, Dauriat turned to Gabusson with a gesture worthy of\nTalma.\n\n\"Gabusson, my friend,\" he said, \"from this day forward, when anybody\nbegins to talk of works in manuscript here--Do you hear that, all of\nyou?\" he broke in upon himself; and three assistants at once emerged\nfrom among the piles of books at the sound of their employer's\nwrathful voice. \"If anybody comes here with manuscripts,\" he\ncontinued, looking at the finger-nails of a well-kept hand, \"ask him\nwhether it is poetry or prose; and if he says poetry, show him the\ndoor at once. Verses mean reverses in the booktrade.\"\n\n\"Bravo! well put, Dauriat,\" cried the chorus of journalists.\n\n\"It is true!\" cried the bookseller, striding about his shop with\nLucien's manuscript in his hand. \"You have no idea, gentlemen, of the\namount of harm that Byron, Lamartine, Victor Hugo, Casimir Delavigne,\nCanalis, and Beranger have done by their success. The fame of them has\nbrought down an invasion of barbarians upon us. I know _this_: there\nare a thousand volumes of manuscript poetry going the round of the\npublishers at this moment, things that nobody can make head nor tail\nof, stories in verse that begin in the middle, like _The Corsair_ and\n_Lara_. They set up to be original, forsooth, and indulge in stanzas\nthat nobody can understand, and descriptive poetry after the pattern\nof the younger men who discovered Delille, and imagine that they are\ndoing something new. Poets have been swarming like cockchafers for two\nyears past. I have lost twenty thousand francs through poetry in the\nlast twelvemonth. You ask Gabusson! There may be immortal poets\nsomewhere in the world; I know of some that are blooming and rosy, and\nhave no beards on their chins as yet,\" he continued, looking at\nLucien; \"but in the trade, young man, there are only four poets\n--Beranger, Casimir Delavigne, Lamartine, and Victor Hugo; as for\nCanalis--he is a poet made by sheer force of writing him up.\"\n\nLucien felt that he lacked the courage to hold up his head and show\nhis spirit before all these influential persons, who were laughing\nwith all their might. He knew very well that he should look hopelessly\nridiculous, and yet he felt consumed by a fierce desire to catch the\nbookseller by the throat, to ruffle the insolent composure of his\ncravat, to break the gold chain that glittered on the man's chest,\ntrample his watch under his feet, and tear him in pieces. Mortified\nvanity opened the door to thoughts of vengeance, and inwardly he swore\neternal enmity to that bookseller. But he smiled amiably.\n\n\"Poetry is like the sun,\" said Blondet, \"giving life alike to primeval\nforests and to ants and gnats and mosquitoes. There is no virtue but\nhas a vice to match, and literature breeds the publisher.\"\n\n\"And the journalist,\" said Lousteau.\n\nDauriat burst out laughing.\n\n\"What is this after all?\" he asked, holding up the manuscript.\n\n\"A volume of sonnets that will put Petrarch to the blush,\" said\nLousteau.\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"Just what I say,\" answered Lousteau, seeing the knowing smile that\nwent round the group. Lucien could not take offence but he chafed\ninwardly.\n\n\"Very well, I will read them,\" said Dauriat, with a regal gesture that\nmarked the full extent of the concession. \"If these sonnets of yours\nare up to the level of the nineteenth century, I will make a great\npoet of you, my boy.\"\n\n\"If he has brains to equal his good looks, you will run no great\nrisks,\" remarked one of the greatest public speakers of the day, a\ndeputy who was chatting with the editor of the _Minerve_, and a writer\nfor the _Constitutionnel_.\n\n\"Fame means twelve thousand francs in reviews, and a thousand more for\ndinners, General,\" said Dauriat. \"If M. Benjamin de Constant means to\nwrite a paper on this young poet, it will not be long before I make a\nbargain with him.\"\n\nAt the title of General, and the distinguished name of Benjamin\nConstant, the bookseller's shop took the proportions of Olympus for\nthe provincial great man.\n\n\"Lousteau, I want a word with you,\" said Finot; \"but I shall see you\nagain later, at the theatre.--Dauriat, I will take your offer, but on\nconditions. Let us step into your office.\"\n\n\"Come in, my boy,\" answered Dauriat, allowing Finot to pass before\nhim. Then, intimating to some ten persons still waiting for him that\nhe was engaged, he likewise was about to disappear when Lucien\nimpatiently stopped him.\n\n\"You are keeping my manuscript. When shall I have an answer?\"\n\n\"Oh, come back in three or four days, my little poet, and we will\nsee.\"\n\nLousteau hurried Lucien away; he had not time to take leave of Vernou\nand Blondet and Raoul Nathan, nor to salute General Foy nor Benjamin\nConstant, whose book on the Hundred Days was just about to appear.\nLucien scarcely caught a glimpse of fair hair, a refined oval-shaped\nface, keen eyes, and the pleasant-looking mouth belonging to the man\nwho had played the part of a Potemkin to Mme. de Stael for twenty\nyears, and now was at war with the Bourbons, as he had been at war\nwith Napoleon. He was destined to win his cause and to die stricken to\nearth by his victory.\n\n\"What a shop!\" exclaimed Lucien, as he took his place in the cab\nbeside Lousteau.\n\n\"To the Panorama-Dramatique; look sharp, and you shall have thirty\nsous,\" Etienne Lousteau called to the cabman.--\"Dauriat is a rascal\nwho sells books to the amount of fifteen or sixteen hundred thousand\nfrancs every year. He is a kind of Minister of Literature,\" Lousteau\ncontinued. His self-conceit had been pleasantly tickled, and he was\nshowing off before Lucien. \"Dauriat is just as grasping as Barbet, but\nit is on a wholesale scale. Dauriat can be civil, and he is generous,\nbut he has a great opinion of himself; as for his wit, it consists in\na faculty for picking up all that he hears, and his shop is a capital\nplace to frequent. You meet all the best men at Dauriat's. A young\nfellow learns more there in an hour than by poring over books for\nhalf-a-score of years. People talk about articles and concoct\nsubjects; you make the acquaintance of great or influential people who\nmay be useful to you. You must know people if you mean to get on\nnowadays.--It is all luck, you see. And as for sitting by yourself in\na corner alone with your intellect, it is the most dangerous thing of\nall.\"\n\n\"But what insolence!\" said Lucien.\n\n\"Pshaw! we all of us laugh at Dauriat,\" said Etienne. \"If you are in\nneed of him, he tramples upon you; if he has need of the _Journal des\nDebats_, Emile Blondet sets him spinning like a top. Oh, if you take\nto literature, you will see a good many queer things. Well, what was\nI telling you, eh?\"\n\n\"Yes, you were right,\" said Lucien. \"My experience in that shop was\neven more painful than I expected, after your programme.\"\n\n\"Why do you choose to suffer? You find your subject, you wear out your\nwits over it with toiling at night, you throw your very life into it:\nand after all your journeyings in the fields of thought, the monument\nreared with your life-blood is simply a good or a bad speculation for\na publisher. Your work will sell or it will not sell; and therein, for\nthem, lies the whole question. A book means so much capital to risk,\nand the better the book, the less likely it is to sell. A man of\ntalent rises above the level of ordinary heads; his success varies in\ndirect ratio with the time required for his work to be appreciated.\nAnd no publisher wants to wait. To-day's book must be sold by\nto-morrow. Acting on this system, publishers and booksellers do not\ncare to take real literature, books that call for the high praise that\ncomes slowly.\"\n\n\"D'Arthez was right,\" exclaimed Lucien.\n\n\"Do you know d'Arthez?\" asked Lousteau. \"I know of no more dangerous\ncompany than solitary spirits like that fellow yonder, who fancy that\nthey can draw the world after them. All of us begin by thinking that\nwe are capable of great things; and when once a youthful imagination\nis heated by this superstition, the candidate for posthumous honors\nmakes no attempt to move the world while such moving of the world is\nboth possible and profitable; he lets the time go by. I am for\nMahomet's system--if the mountain does not come to me, I am for going\nto the mountain.\"\n\nThe common-sense so trenchantly put in this sally left Lucien halting\nbetween the resignation preached by the brotherhood and Lousteau's\nmilitant doctrine. He said not a word till they reached the Boulevard\ndu Temple.\n\nThe Panorama-Dramatique no longer exists. A dwelling-house stands on\nthe site of the once charming theatre in the Boulevard du Temple,\nwhere two successive managements collapsed without making a single\nhit; and yet Vignol, who has since fallen heir to some of Potier's\npopularity, made his _debut_ there; and Florine, five years later a\ncelebrated actress, made her first appearance in the theatre opposite\nthe Rue Charlot. Play-houses, like men, have their vicissitudes. The\nPanorama-Dramatique suffered from competition. The machinations of its\nrivals, the Ambigu, the Gaite, the Porte Saint-Martin, and the\nVaudeville, together with a plethora of restrictions and a scarcity of\ngood plays, combined to bring about the downfall of the house. No\ndramatic author cared to quarrel with a prosperous theatre for the\nsake of the Panorama-Dramatique, whose existence was, to say the\nleast, problematical. The management at this moment, however, was\ncounting on the success of a new melodramatic comedy by M. du Bruel, a\nyoung author who, after working in collaboration with divers\ncelebrities, had now produced a piece professedly entirely his own. It\nhad been specially composed for the leading lady, a young actress who\nbegan her stage career as a supernumerary at the Gaite, and had been\npromoted to small parts for the last twelvemonth. But though Mlle.\nFlorine's acting had attracted some attention, she obtained no\nengagement, and the Panorama accordingly had carried her off. Coralie,\nanother actress, was to make her _debut_ at the same time.\n\nLucien was amazed at the power wielded by the press. \"This gentleman\nis with me,\" said Etienne Lousteau, and the box-office clerks bowed\nbefore him as one man.\n\n\"You will find it no easy matter to get seats,\" said the head-clerk.\n\"There is nothing left now but the stage box.\"\n\nA certain amount of time was wasted in controversies with the\nbox-keepers in the lobbies, when Etienne said, \"Let us go behind\nthe scenes; we will speak to the manager, he will take us into the\nstage-box; and besides, I will introduce you to Florine, the heroine\nof the evening.\"\n\nAt a sign from Etienne Lousteau, the doorkeeper of the orchestra took\nout a little key and unlocked a door in the thickness of the wall.\nLucien, following his friend, went suddenly out of the lighted\ncorridor into the black darkness of the passage between the house and\nthe wings. A short flight of damp steps surmounted, one of the\nstrangest of all spectacles opened out before the provincial poet's\neyes. The height of the roof, the slenderness of the props, the\nladders hung with Argand lamps, the atrocious ugliness of scenery\nbeheld at close quarters, the thick paint on the actors' faces, and\ntheir outlandish costumes, made of such coarse materials, the stage\ncarpenters in greasy jackets, the firemen, the stage manager strutting\nabout with his hat on his head, the supernumeraries sitting among the\nhanging back-scenes, the ropes and pulleys, the heterogeneous\ncollection of absurdities, shabby, dirty, hideous, and gaudy, was\nsomething so altogether different from the stage seen over the\nfootlights, that Lucien's astonishment knew no bounds. The curtain was\njust about to fall on a good old-fashioned melodrama entitled _Bertram_,\na play adapted from a tragedy by Maturin which Charles Nodier,\ntogether with Byron and Sir Walter Scott, held in the highest esteem,\nthough the play was a failure on the stage in Paris.\n\n\"Keep a tight hold of my arm, unless you have a mind to fall through a\ntrap-door, or bring down a forest on your head; you will pull down a\npalace, or carry off a cottage, if you are not careful,\" said Etienne.\n--\"Is Florine in her dressing-room, my pet?\" he added, addressing an\nactress who stood waiting for her cue.\n\n\"Yes, love. Thank you for the things you said about me. You are so\nmuch nicer since Florine has come here.\"\n\n\"Come, don't spoil your entry, little one. Quick with you, look sharp,\nand say, 'Stop, wretched man!' nicely, for there are two thousand\nfrancs of takings.\"\n\nLucien was struck with amazement when the girl's whole face suddenly\nchanged, and she shrieked, \"Stop, wretched man!\" a cry that froze the\nblood in your veins. She was no longer the same creature.\n\n\"So this is the stage,\" he said to Lousteau.\n\n\"It is like the bookseller's shop in the Wooden Galleries, or a\nliterary paper,\" said Etienne Lousteau; \"it is a kitchen, neither more\nnor less.\"\n\nNathan appeared at this moment.\n\n\"What brings you here?\" inquired Lousteau.\n\n\"Why, I am doing the minor theatres for the _Gazette_ until something\nbetter turns up.\"\n\n\"Oh! come to supper with us this evening; speak well of Florine, and I\nwill do as much for you.\"\n\n\"Very much at your service,\" returned Nathan.\n\n\"You know; she is living in the Rue du Bondy now.\"\n\n\"Lousteau, dear boy, who is the handsome young man that you have\nbrought with you?\" asked the actress, now returned to the wings.\n\n\"A great poet, dear, that will have a famous name one of these days.\n--M. Nathan, I must introduce M. Lucien de Rubempre to you, as you are\nto meet again at supper.\"\n\n\"You have a good name, monsieur,\" said Nathan.\n\n\"Lucien, M. Raoul Nathan,\" continued Etienne.\n\n\"I read your book two days ago; and, upon my word, I cannot understand\nhow you, who have written such a book, and such poetry, can be so\nhumble to a journalist.\"\n\n\"Wait till your first book comes out,\" said Nathan, and a shrewd smile\nflitted over his face.\n\n\"I say! I say! here are Ultras and Liberals actually shaking hands!\"\ncried Vernou, spying the trio.\n\n\"In the morning I hold the views of my paper,\" said Nathan, \"in the\nevening I think as I please; all journalists see double at night.\"\n\nFelicien Vernou turned to Lousteau.\n\n\"Finot is looking for you, Etienne; he came with me, and--here he is!\"\n\n\"Ah, by the by, there is not a place in the house, is there?\" asked\nFinot.\n\n\"You will always find a place in our hearts,\" said the actress, with\nthe sweetest smile imaginable.\n\n\"I say, my little Florville, are you cured already of your fancy? They\ntold me that a Russian prince had carried you off.\"\n\n\"Who carries off women in these days\" said Florville (she who had\ncried, \"Stop, wretched man!\"). \"We stayed at Saint-Mande for ten days,\nand my prince got off with paying the forfeit money to the management.\nThe manager will go down on his knees to pray for some more Russian\nprinces,\" Florville continued, laughing; \"the forfeit money was so\nmuch clear gain.\"\n\n\"And as for you, child,\" said Finot, turning to a pretty girl in a\npeasant's costume, \"where did you steal these diamond ear-drops? Have\nyou hooked an Indian prince?\"\n\n\"No, a blacking manufacturer, an Englishman, who has gone off already.\nIt is not everybody who can find millionaire shopkeepers, tired of\ndomestic life, whenever they like, as Florine does and Coralie. Aren't\nthey just lucky?\"\n\n\"Florville, you will make a bad entry,\" said Lousteau; \"the blacking\nhas gone to your head!\"\n\n\"If you want a success,\" said Nathan, \"instead of screaming, 'He is\nsaved!' like a Fury, walk on quite quietly, go to the staircase, and\nsay, 'He is saved,' in a chest voice, like Pasta's '_O patria_,' in\n_Tancreda_.--There, go along!\" and he pushed her towards the stage.\n\n\"It is too late,\" said Vernou, \"the effect has hung fire.\"\n\n\"What did she do? the house is applauding like mad,\" asked Lousteau.\n\n\"Went down on her knees and showed her bosom; that is her great\nresource,\" said the blacking-maker's widow.\n\n\"The manager is giving up the stage box to us; you will find me there\nwhen you come,\" said Finot, as Lousteau walked off with Lucien.\n\nAt the back of the stage, through a labyrinth of scenery and\ncorridors, the pair climbed several flights of stairs and reached a\nlittle room on a third floor, Nathan and Felicien Vernou following\nthem.\n\n\"Good-day or good-night, gentlemen,\" said Florine. Then, turning to a\nshort, stout man standing in a corner, \"These gentlemen are the rulers\nof my destiny,\" she said, my future is in their hands; but they will\nbe under our table to-morrow morning, I hope, if M. Lousteau has\nforgotten nothing----\"\n\n\"Forgotten! You are going to have Blondet of the _Debats_,\" said\nEtienne, \"the genuine Blondet, the very Blondet--Blondet himself, in\nshort.\"\n\n\"Oh! Lousteau, you dear boy! stop, I must give you a kiss,\" and she\nflung her arms about the journalist's neck. Matifat, the stout person\nin the corner, looked serious at this.\n\nFlorine was thin; her beauty, like a bud, gave promise of the flower\nto come; the girl of sixteen could only delight the eyes of artists\nwho prefer the sketch to the picture. All the quick subtlety of her\ncharacter was visible in the features of the charming actress, who at\nthat time might have sat for Goethe's Mignon. Matifat, a wealthy\ndruggist of the Rue des Lombards, had imagined that a little Boulevard\nactress would have no very expensive tastes, but in eleven months\nFlorine had cost him sixty thousand francs. Nothing seemed more\nextraordinary to Lucien than the sight of an honest and worthy\nmerchant standing like a statue of the god Terminus in the actress'\nnarrow dressing-room, a tiny place some ten feet square, hung with a\npretty wall-paper, and adorned with a full-length mirror, a sofa, and\ntwo chairs. There was a fireplace in the dressing-closet, a carpet on\nthe floor, and cupboards all round the room. A dresser was putting the\nfinishing touches to a Spanish costume; for Florine was to take the\npart of a countess in an imbroglio.\n\n\"That girl will be the handsomest actress in Paris in five years'\ntime,\" said Nathan, turning to Felicien Vernou.\n\n\"By the by, darlings, you will take care of me to-morrow, won't you?\"\nsaid Florine, turning to the three journalists. \"I have engaged cabs\nfor to-night, for I am going to send you home as tipsy as Shrove\nTuesday. Matifat has sent in wines--oh! wines worthy of Louis XVIII.,\nand engaged the Prussian ambassador's cook.\"\n\n\"We expect something enormous from the look of the gentleman,\"\nremarked Nathan.\n\n\"And he is quite aware that he is treating the most dangerous men in\nParis,\" added Florine.\n\nMatifat was looking uneasily at Lucien; he felt jealous of the young\nman's good looks.\n\n\"But here is some one that I do not know,\" Florine continued,\nconfronting Lucien. \"Which of you has imported the Apollo Belvedere\nfrom Florence? He is as charming as one of Girodet's figures.\"\n\n\"He is a poet, mademoiselle, from the provinces. I forgot to present\nhim to you; you are so beautiful to-night that you put the _Complete\nGuide to Etiquette_ out of a man's head----\"\n\n\"Is he so rich that he can afford to write poetry?\" asked Florine.\n\n\"Poor as Job,\" said Lucien.\n\n\"It is a great temptation for some of us,\" said the actress.\n\nJust then the author of the play suddenly entered, and Lucien beheld\nM. du Bruel, a short, attenuated young man in an overcoat, a composite\nhuman blend of the jack-in-office, the owner of house-property, and\nthe stockbroker.\n\n\"Florine, child,\" said this personage, \"are you sure of your part, eh?\nNo slips of memory, you know. And mind that scene in the second act,\nmake the irony tell, bring out that subtle touch; say, 'I do not love\nyou,' just as we agreed.\"\n\n\"Why do you take parts in which you have to say such things?\" asked\nMatifat.\n\nThe druggist's remark was received with a general shout of laughter.\n\n\"What does it matter to you,\" said Florine, \"so long as I don't say\nsuch things to you, great stupid?--Oh! his stupidity is the pleasure\nof my life,\" she continued, glancing at the journalist. \"Upon my word,\nI would pay him so much for every blunder, if it would not be the ruin\nof me.\"\n\n\"Yes, but you will look at me when you say it, as you do when you are\nrehearsing, and it gives me a turn,\" remonstrated the druggist.\n\n\"Very well, then, I will look at my friend Lousteau here.\"\n\nA bell rang outside in the passage.\n\n\"Go out, all of you!\" cried Florine; \"let me read my part over again\nand try to understand it.\"\n\nLucien and Lousteau were the last to go. Lousteau set a kiss on\nFlorine's shoulder, and Lucien heard her say, \"Not to-night.\nImpossible. That stupid old animal told his wife that he was going out\ninto the country.\"\n\n\"Isn't she charming?\" said Etienne, as they came away.\n\n\"But--but that Matifat, my dear fellow----\"\n\n\"Oh! you know nothing of Parisian life, my boy. Some things cannot be\nhelped. Suppose that you fell in love with a married woman, it comes\nto the same thing. It all depends on the way that you look at it.\"\n\nEtienne and Lucien entered the stage-box, and found the manager there\nwith Finot. Matifat was in the ground-floor box exactly opposite with\na friend of his, a silk-mercer named Camusot (Coralie's protector),\nand a worthy little old soul, his father-in-law. All three of these\ncity men were polishing their opera-glasses, and anxiously scanning\nthe house; certain symptoms in the pit appeared to disturb them. The\nusual heterogeneous first-night elements filled the boxes--journalists\nand their mistresses, _lorettes_ and their lovers, a sprinkling of the\ndetermined playgoers who never miss a first night if they can help it,\nand a very few people of fashion who care for this sort of sensation.\nThe first box was occupied by the head of a department, to whom du\nBruel, maker of vaudevilles, owed a snug little sinecure in the\nTreasury.\n\nLucien had gone from surprise to surprise since the dinner at\nFlicoteaux's. For two months Literature had meant a life of poverty\nand want; in Lousteau's room he had seen it at its cynical worst; in\nthe Wooden Galleries he had met Literature abject and Literature\ninsolent. The sharp contrasts of heights and depths; of compromise\nwith conscience; of supreme power and want of principle; of treachery\nand pleasure; of mental elevation and bondage--all this made his head\nswim, he seemed to be watching some strange unheard-of drama.\n\nFinot was talking with the manager. \"Do you think du Bruel's piece\nwill pay?\" he asked.\n\n\"Du Bruel has tried to do something in Beaumarchais' style. Boulevard\naudiences don't care for that kind of thing; they like harrowing\nsensations; wit is not much appreciated here. Everything depends on\nFlorine and Coralie to-night; they are bewitchingly pretty and\ngraceful, wear very short skirts, and dance a Spanish dance, and\npossibly they may carry off the piece with the public. The whole\naffair is a gambling speculation. A few clever notices in the papers,\nand I may make a hundred thousand crowns, if the play takes.\"\n\n\"Oh! come, it will only be a moderate success, I can see,\" said Finot.\n\n\"Three of the theatres have got up a plot,\" continued the manager;\n\"they will even hiss the piece, but I have made arrangements to defeat\ntheir kind intentions. I have squared the men in their pay; they will\nmake a muddle of it. A couple of city men yonder have taken a hundred\ntickets apiece to secure a triumph for Florine and Coralie, and given\nthem to acquaintances able and ready to act as chuckers out. The\nfellows, having been paid twice, will go quietly, and a scene of that\nsort always makes a good impression on the house.\"\n\n\"Two hundred tickets! What invaluable men!\" exclaimed Finot.\n\n\"Yes. With two more actresses as handsomely kept as Florine and\nCoralie, I should make something out of the business.\"\n\nFor the past two hours the word money had been sounding in Lucien's\nears as the solution of every difficulty. In the theatre as in the\npublishing trade, and in the publishing trade as in the\nnewspaper-office--it was everywhere the same; there was not a word of\nart or of glory. The steady beat of the great pendulum, Money, seemed\nto fall like hammer-strokes on his heart and brain. And yet while the\norchestra played the overture, while the pit was full of noisy tumult\nof applause and hisses, unconsciously he drew a comparison between\nthis scene and others that came up in his mind. Visions arose before\nhim of David and the printing-office, of the poetry that he came to\nknow in that atmosphere of pure peace, when together they beheld the\nwonders of Art, the high successes of genius, and visions of glory\nborne on stainless wings. He thought of the evenings spent with\nd'Arthez and his friends, and tears glittered in his eyes.\n\n\"What is the matter with you?\" asked Etienne Lousteau.\n\n\"I see poetry fallen into the mire.\"\n\n\"Ah! you have still some illusions left, my dear fellow.\"\n\n\"Is there nothing for it but to cringe and submit to thickheads like\nMatifat and Camusot, as actresses bow down to journalists, and we\nourselves to the booksellers?\"\n\n\"My boy, do you see that dull-brained fellow?\" said Etienne, lowering\nhis voice, and glancing at Finot. \"He has neither genius nor\ncleverness, but he is covetous; he means to make a fortune at all\ncosts, and he is a keen man of business. Didn't you see how he made\nforty per cent out of me at Dauriat's, and talked as if he were doing\nme a favor?--Well, he gets letters from not a few unknown men of\ngenius who go down on their knees to him for a hundred francs.\"\n\nThe words recalled the pen-and-ink sketch that lay on the table in the\neditor's office and the words, \"Finot, my hundred francs!\" Lucien's\ninmost soul shrank from the man in disgust.\n\n\"I would sooner die,\" he said.\n\n\"Sooner live,\" retorted Etienne.\n\nThe curtain rose, and the stage-manager went off to the wings to give\norders. Finot turned to Etienne.\n\n\"My dear fellow, Dauriat has passed his word; I am proprietor of\none-third of his weekly paper. I have agreed to give thirty thousand\nfrancs in cash, on condition that I am to be editor and director. 'Tis\na splendid thing. Blondet told me that the Government intends to take\nrestrictive measures against the press; there will be no new papers\nallowed; in six months' time it will cost a million francs to start a\nnew journal, so I struck a bargain though I have only ten thousand\nfrancs in hand. Listen to me. If you can sell one-half of my share,\nthat is one-sixth of the paper, to Matifat for thirty thousand francs,\nyou shall be editor of my little paper with a salary of two hundred\nand fifty francs per month. I want in any case to have the control of\nmy old paper, and to keep my hold upon it; but nobody need know that,\nand your name will appear as editor. You will be paid at the rate of\nfive francs per column; you need not pay contributors more than three\nfrancs, and you keep the difference. That means another four hundred\nand fifty francs per month. But, at the same time, I reserve the right\nto use the paper to attack or defend men or causes, as I please; and\nyou may indulge your own likes and dislikes so long as you do not\ninterfere with my schemes. Perhaps I may be a Ministerialist, perhaps\nUltra, I do not know yet; but I mean to keep up my connections with\nthe Liberal party (below the surface). I can speak out with you; you\nare a good fellow. I might, perhaps, give you the Chambers to do for\nanother paper on which I work; I am afraid I can scarcely keep on with\nit now. So let Florine do this bit of jockeying; tell her to put the\nscrew on her druggist. If I can't find the money within forty-eight\nhours, I must cry off my bargain. Dauriat sold another third to his\nprinter and paper-dealer for thirty thousand francs; so he has his own\nthird _gratis_, and ten thousand francs to the good, for he only gave\nfifty thousand for the whole affair. And in another year's time the\nmagazine will be worth two hundred thousand francs, if the Court buys\nit up; if the Court has the good sense to suppress newspapers, as they\nsay.\"\n\n\"You are lucky,\" said Lousteau.\n\n\"If you had gone through all that I have endured, you would not say\nthat of me. I had my fill of misery in those days, you see, and there\nwas no help for it. My father is a hatter; he still keeps a shop in\nthe Rue du Coq. Nothing but millions of money or a social cataclysm\ncan open out the way to my goal; and of the two alternatives, I don't\nknow now that the revolution is not the easier. If I bore your\nfriend's name, I should have a chance to get on. Hush, here comes the\nmanager. Good-bye,\" and Finot rose to his feet, \"I am going to the\nOpera. I shall very likely have a duel on my hands to-morrow, for I\nhave put my initials to a terrific attack on a couple of dancers under\nthe protection of two Generals. I am giving it them hot and strong at\nthe Opera.\"\n\n\"Aha?\" said the manager.\n\n\"Yes. They are stingy with me,\" returned Finot, \"now cutting off a\nbox, and now declining to take fifty subscriptions. I have sent in my\n_ultimatum_; I mean to have a hundred subscriptions out of them and a\nbox four times a month. If they take my terms, I shall have eight\nhundred readers and a thousand paying subscribers, so we shall have\ntwelve hundred with the New Year.\"\n\n\"You will end by ruining us,\" said the manager.\n\n\"_You_ are not much hurt with your ten subscriptions. I had two good\nnotices put into the _Constitutionnel_.\"\n\n\"Oh! I am not complaining of you,\" cried the manager.\n\n\"Good-bye till to-morrow evening, Lousteau,\" said Finot. \"You can give\nme your answer at the Francais; there is a new piece on there; and as\nI shall not be able to write the notice, you can take my box. I will\ngive you preference; you have worked yourself to death for me, and I\nam grateful. Felicien Vernou offered twenty thousand francs for a\nthird share of my little paper, and to work without a salary for a\ntwelvemonth; but I want to be absolute master. Good-bye.\"\n\n\"He is not named Finot\" (_finaud_, slyboots) \"for nothing,\" said Lucien.\n\n\"He is a gallows-bird that will get on in the world,\" said Etienne,\ncareless whether the wily schemer overheard the remark or not, as he\nshut the door of the box.\n\n\"_He_!\" said the manager. \"He will be a millionaire; he will enjoy the\nrespect of all who know him; he may perhaps have friends some day----\"\n\n\"Good heavens! what a den!\" said Lucien. \"And are you going to drag\nthat excellent creature into such a business?\" he continued, looking\nat Florine, who gave them side glances from the stage.\n\n\"She will carry it through too. You do not know the devotion and the\nwiles of these beloved beings,\" said Lousteau.\n\n\"They redeem their failings and expiate all their sins by boundless\nlove, when they love,\" said the manager. \"A great love is all the\ngrander in an actress by reason of its violent contrast with her\nsurroundings.\"\n\n\"And he who finds it, finds a diamond worthy of the proudest crown\nlying in the mud,\" returned Lousteau.\n\n\"But Coralie is not attending to her part,\" remarked the manager.\n\"Coralie is smitten with our friend here, all unsuspicious of his\nconquest, and Coralie will make a fiasco; she is missing her cues,\nthis is the second time she had not heard the prompter. Pray, go into\nthe corner, monsieur,\" he continued. \"If Coralie is smitten with you,\nI will go and tell her that you have left the house.\"\n\n\"No! no!\" cried Lousteau; \"tell Coralie that this gentleman is coming\nto supper, and that she can do as she likes with him, and she will\nplay like Mlle. Mars.\"\n\nThe manager went, and Lucien turned to Etienne. \"What! do you mean to\nsay that you will ask that druggist, through Mlle. Florine, to pay\nthirty thousand francs for one-half a share, when Finot gave no more\nfor the whole of it? And ask without the slightest scruple?----\"\n\nLousteau interrupted Lucien before he had time to finish his\nexpostulation. \"My dear boy, what country can you come from? The\ndruggist is not a man; he is a strong box delivered into our hands by\nhis fancy for an actress.\"\n\n\"How about your conscience?\"\n\n\"Conscience, my dear fellow, is a stick which every one takes up to\nbeat his neighbor and not for application to his own back. Come, now!\nwho the devil are you angry with? In one day chance has worked a\nmiracle for you, a miracle for which I have been waiting these two\nyears, and you must needs amuse yourself by finding fault with the\nmeans? What! you appear to me to possess intelligence; you seem to be\nin a fair way to reach that freedom from prejudice which is a first\nnecessity to intellectual adventurers in the world we live in; and are\nyou wallowing in scruples worthy of a nun who accuses herself of\neating an egg with concupiscence? . . . If Florine succeeds, I shall\nbe editor of a newspaper with a fixed salary of two hundred and fifty\nfrancs per month; I shall take the important plays and leave the\nvaudevilles to Vernou, and you can take my place and do the Boulevard\ntheatres, and so get a foot in the stirrup. You will make three francs\nper column and write a column a day--thirty columns a month means\nninety francs; you will have some sixty francs worth of books to sell\nto Barbet; and lastly, you can demand ten tickets a month of each of\nyour theatres--that is, forty tickets in all--and sell them for forty\nfrancs to a Barbet who deals in them (I will introduce you to the\nman), so you will have two hundred francs coming in every month. Then\nif you make yourself useful to Finot, you might get a hundred francs\nfor an article in this new weekly review of his, in which case you\nwould show uncommon talent, for all the articles are signed, and you\ncannot put in slip-shod work as you can on a small paper. In that case\nyou would be making a hundred crowns a month. Now, my dear boy, there\nare men of ability, like that poor d'Arthez, who dines at Flicoteaux's\nevery day, who may wait for ten years before they will make a hundred\ncrowns; and you will be making four thousand francs a year by your\npen, to say nothing of the books you will write for the trade, if you\ndo work of that kind.\n\n\"Now, a sub-prefect's salary only amounts to a thousand crowns, and\nthere he stops in his arrondissement, wearing away time like the rung\nof a chair. I say nothing of the pleasure of going to the theatre\nwithout paying for your seat, for that is a delight which quickly\npalls; but you can go behind the scenes in four theatres. Be hard and\nsarcastic for a month or two, and you will be simply overwhelmed with\ninvitations from actresses, and their adorers will pay court to you;\nyou will only dine at Flicoteaux's when you happen to have less than\nthirty sous in your pocket and no dinner engagement. At the\nLuxembourg, at five o'clock, you did not know which way to turn; now,\nyou are on the eve of entering a privileged class, you will be one of\nthe hundred persons who tell France what to think. In three days'\ntime, if all goes well, you can, if you choose, make a man's life a\ncurse to him by putting thirty jokes at his expense in print at the\nrate of three a day; you can, if you choose, draw a revenue of\npleasure from the actresses at your theatres; you can wreck a good\nplay and send all Paris running after a bad one. If Dauriat declines\nto pay you for your _Marguerites_, you can make him come to you, and\nmeekly and humbly implore you to take two thousand francs for them. If\nyou have the ability, and knock off two or three articles that\nthreaten to spoil some of Dauriat's speculations, or to ruin a book on\nwhich he counts, you will see him come climbing up your stairs like a\nclematis, and always at the door of your dwelling. As for your novel,\nthe booksellers who would show you more or less politely to the door\nat this moment will be standing outside your attic in a string, and\nthe value of the manuscript, which old Doguereau valued at four\nhundred francs will rise to four thousand. These are the advantages of\nthe journalist's profession. So let us do our best to keep all\nnewcomers out of it. It needs an immense amount of brains to make your\nway, and a still greater amount of luck. And here are you quibbling\nover your good fortune! If we had not met to-day, you see, at\nFlicoteaux's, you might have danced attendance on the booksellers for\nanother three years, or starved like d'Arthez in a garret. By the time\nthat d'Arthez is as learned as Bayle and as great a writer of prose as\nRousseau, we shall have made our fortunes, you and I, and we shall\nhold his in our hands--wealth and fame to give or to hold. Finot will\nbe a deputy and proprietor of a great newspaper, and we shall be\nwhatever we meant to be--peers of France, or prisoner for debt in\nSainte-Pelagie.\"\n\n\"So Finot will sell his paper to the highest bidder among the\nMinisters, just as he sells favorable notices to Mme. Bastienne and\nruns down Mlle. Virginie, saying that Mme. Bastienne's bonnets are\nsuperior to the millinery which they praised at first!\" said Lucien,\nrecollecting that scene in the office.\n\n\"My dear fellow, you are a simpleton,\" Lousteau remarked drily. \"Three\nyears ago Finot was walking on the uppers of his boots, dining for\neighteen sous at Tabar's, and knocking off a tradesman's prospectus\n(when he could get it) for ten francs. His clothes hung together by\nsome miracle as mysterious as the Immaculate Conception. _Now_, Finot\nhas a paper of his own, worth about a hundred thousand francs. What\nwith subscribers who pay and take no copies, genuine subscriptions,\nand indirect taxes levied by his uncle, he is making twenty thousand\nfrancs a year. He dines most sumptuously every day; he has set up a\ncabriolet within the last month; and now, at last, behold him the\neditor of a weekly review with a sixth share, for which he will not\npay a penny, a salary of five hundred francs per month, and another\nthousand francs for supplying matter which costs him nothing, and for\nwhich the firm pays. You yourself, to begin with, if Finot consents to\npay you fifty francs per sheet, will be only too glad to let him have\ntwo or three articles for nothing. When you are in his position, you\ncan judge Finot; a man can only be tried by his peers. And for you, is\nthere not an immense future opening out before you, if you will\nblindly minister to his enmity, attack at Finot's bidding, and praise\nwhen he gives the word? Suppose that you yourself wish to be revenged\nupon somebody, you can break a foe or friend on the wheel. You have\nonly to say to me, 'Lousteau, let us put an end to So-and-so,' and we\nwill kill him by a phrase put in the paper morning by morning; and\nafterwards you can slay the slain with a solemn article in Finot's\nweekly. Indeed, if it is a matter of capital importance to you, Finot\nwould allow you to bludgeon your man in a big paper with ten or twelve\nthousand subscribers, _if_ you make yourself indispensable to Finot.\"\n\n\"Then are you sure that Florine can bring her druggist to make the\nbargain?\" asked Lucien, dazzled by these prospects.\n\n\"Quite sure. Now comes the interval, I will go and tell her everything\nat once in a word or two; it will be settled to-night. If Florine once\nhas her lesson by heart, she will have all my wit and her own\nbesides.\"\n\n\"And there sits that honest tradesman, gaping with open-mouthed\nadmiration at Florine, little suspecting that you are about to get\nthirty thousand francs out of him!----\"\n\n\"More twaddle! Anybody might think that the man was going to be\nrobbed!\" cried Lousteau. \"Why, my dear boy, if the minister buys the\nnewspaper, the druggist may make twenty thousand francs in six months\non an investment of thirty thousand. Matifat is not looking at the\nnewspaper, but at Florine's prospects. As soon as it is known that\nMatifat and Camusot--(for they will go shares)--that Matifat and\nCamusot are proprietors of a review, the newspapers will be full of\nfriendly notices of Florine and Coralie. Florine's name will be made;\nshe will perhaps obtain an engagement in another theatre with a salary\nof twelve thousand francs. In fact, Matifat will save a thousand\nfrancs every month in dinners and presents to journalists. You know\nnothing of men, nor of the way things are managed.\"\n\n\"Poor man!\" said Lucien, \"he is looking forward to an evening's\npleasure.\"\n\n\"And he will be sawn in two with arguments until Florine sees Finot's\nreceipt for a sixth share of the paper. And to-morrow I shall be\neditor of Finot's paper, and making a thousand francs a month. The end\nof my troubles is in sight!\" cried Florine's lover.\n\n\n\nLousteau went out, and Lucien sat like one bewildered, lost in the\ninfinite of thought, soaring above this everyday world. In the Wooden\nGalleries he had seen the wires by which the trade in books is moved;\nhe has seen something of the kitchen where great reputations are made;\nhe had been behind the scenes; he had seen the seamy side of life, the\nconsciences of men involved in the machinery of Paris, the mechanism\nof it all. As he watched Florine on the stage he almost envied\nLousteau his good fortune; already, for a few moments he had forgotten\nMatifat in the background. He was not left alone for long, perhaps for\nnot more than five minutes, but those minutes seemed an eternity.\n\nThoughts rose within him that set his soul on fire, as the spectacle\non the stage had heated his senses. He looked at the women with their\nwanton eyes, all the brighter for the red paint on their cheeks, at\nthe gleaming bare necks, the luxuriant forms outlined by the\nlascivious folds of the basquina, the very short skirts, that\ndisplayed as much as possible of limbs encased in scarlet stockings\nwith green clocks to them--a disquieting vision for the pit.\n\nA double process of corruption was working within him in parallel\nlines, like two channels that will spread sooner or later in flood\ntime and make one. That corruption was eating into Lucien's soul, as\nhe leaned back in his corner, staring vacantly at the curtain, one arm\nresting on the crimson velvet cushion, and his hand drooping over the\nedge. He felt the fascination of the life that was offered to him, of\nthe gleams of light among its clouds; and this so much the more keenly\nbecause it shone out like a blaze of fireworks against the blank\ndarkness of his own obscure, monotonous days of toil.\n\nSuddenly his listless eyes became aware of a burning glance that\nreached him through a rent in the curtain, and roused him from his\nlethargy. Those were Coralie's eyes that glowed upon him. He lowered\nhis head and looked across at Camusot, who just then entered the\nopposite box.\n\nThat amateur was a worthy silk-mercer of the Rue des Bourdonnais,\nstout and substantial, a judge in the commercial court, a father of\nfour children, and the husband of a second wife. At the age of\nfifty-six, with a cap of gray hair on his head, he had the smug\nappearance of a man who has his eighty thousand francs of income; and\nhaving been forced to put up with a good deal that he did not like in\nthe way of business, has fully made up his mind to enjoy the rest of\nhis life, and not to quit this earth until he has had his share of\ncakes and ale. A brow the color of fresh butter and florid cheeks like\na monk's jowl seemed scarcely big enough to contain his exuberant\njubilation. Camusot had left his wife at home, and they were applauding\nCoralie to the skies. All the rich man's citizen vanity was summed up\nand gratified in Coralie; in Coralie's lodging he gave himself the airs\nof a great lord of a bygone day; now, at this moment, he felt that half\nof her success was his; the knowledge that he had paid for it\nconfirmed him in this idea. Camusot's conduct was sanctioned by the\npresence of his father-in-law, a little old fogy with powdered hair\nand leering eyes, highly respected nevertheless.\n\nAgain Lucien felt disgust rising within him. He thought of the year\nwhen he loved Mme. de Bargeton with an exalted and disinterested love;\nand at that thought love, as a poet understands it, spread its white\nwings about him; countless memories drew a circle of distant blue\nhorizon about the great man of Angouleme, and again he fell to\ndreaming.\n\nUp went the curtain, and there stood Coralie and Florine upon the\nstage.\n\n\"He is thinking about as much of you as of the Grand Turk, my dear\ngirl,\" Florine said in an aside while Coralie was finishing her\nspeech.\n\nLucien could not help laughing. He looked at Coralie. She was one of\nthe most charming and captivating actresses in Paris, rivaling Mme.\nPerrin and Mlle. Fleuriet, and destined likewise to share their fate.\nCoralie was a woman of a type that exerts at will a power of\nfascination over men. With an oval face of deep ivory tint, a mouth\nred as a pomegranate, and a chin subtly delicate in its contour as the\nedge of a porcelain cup, Coralie was a Jewess of the sublime type. The\njet black eyes behind their curving lashes seemed to scorch her\neyelids; you could guess how soft they might grow, or how sparks of\nthe heat of the desert might flash from them in response to a summons\nfrom within. The circles of olive shadow about them were bounded by\nthick arching lines of eyebrow. Magnificent mental power, well-nigh\namounting to genius, seemed to dwell in the swarthy forehead beneath\nthe double curve of ebony hair that lay upon it like a crown, and\ngleamed in the light like a varnished surface; but like many another\nactress, Coralie had little wit in spite of her aptness at greenroom\nrepartee, and scarcely any education in spite of her boudoir\nexperience. Her brain was prompted by her senses, her kindness was the\nimpulsive warm-heartedness of girls of her class. But who could\ntrouble over Coralie's psychology when his eyes were dazzled by those\nsmooth, round arms of hers, the spindle-shaped fingers, the fair white\nshoulders, and breast celebrated in the Song of Songs, the flexible\ncurving lines of throat, the graciously moulded outlines beneath the\nscarlet silk stockings? And this beauty, worthy of an Eastern poet,\nwas brought into relief by the conventional Spanish costume of the\nstage. Coralie was the delight of the pit; all eyes dwelt on the\noutlines moulded by the clinging folds of her bodice, and lingered\nover the Andalusian contour of the hips from which her skirt hung,\nfluttering wantonly with every movement. To Lucien, watching this\ncreature, who played for him alone, caring no more for Camusot than a\nstreet-boy in the gallery cares for an apple-paring, there came a\nmoment when he set desire above love, and enjoyment above desire, and\nthe demon of Lust stirred strange thoughts in him.\n\n\"I know nothing of the love that wallows in luxury and wine and\nsensual pleasure,\" he said within himself. \"I have lived more with\nideas than with realities. You must pass through all experience if you\nmean to render all experience. This will be my first great supper, my\nfirst orgy in a new and strange world; why should I not know, for\nonce, the delights which the great lords of the eighteenth century\nsought so eagerly of wantons of the Opera? Must one not first learn of\ncourtesans and actresses the delights, the perfections, the\ntransports, the resources, the subtleties of love, if only to\ntranslate them afterwards into the regions of a higher love than this?\nAnd what is all this, after all, but the poetry of the senses? Two\nmonths ago these women seemed to me to be goddesses guarded by dragons\nthat no one dared approach; I was envying Lousteau just now, but here\nis another handsomer than Florine; why should I not profit by her\nfancy, when the greatest nobles buy a night with such women with their\nrichest treasures? When ambassadors set foot in these depths, they\nfling aside all thought of yesterday or to-morrow. I should be a fool\nto be more squeamish than princes, especially as I love no one as\nyet.\"\n\nLucien had quite forgotten Camusot. To Lousteau he had expressed the\nutmost disgust for this most hateful of all partitions, and now he\nhimself had sunk to the same level, and, carried away by the casuistry\nof his vehement desire, had given the reins to his fancy.\n\n\"Coralie is raving about you,\" said Lousteau as he came in. \"Your\ncountenance, worthy of the greatest Greek sculptors, has worked\nunutterable havoc behind the scenes. You are in luck my dear boy.\nCoralie is eighteen years old, and in a few days' time she may be\nmaking sixty thousand francs a year by her beauty. She is an honest\ngirl still. Since her mother sold her three years ago for sixty\nthousand francs, she has tried to find happiness, and found nothing\nbut annoyance. She took to the stage in a desperate mood; she has a\nhorror of her first purchaser, de Marsay; and when she came out of the\ngalleys, for the king of dandies soon dropped her, she picked up old\nCamusot. She does not care much about him, but he is like a father to\nher, and she endures him and his love. Several times already she has\nrefused the handsomest proposals; she is faithful to Camusot, who lets\nher live in peace. So you are her first love. The first sight of you\nwent to her heart like a pistol-shot, Florine has gone to her\ndressing-room to bring the girl to reason. She is crying over your\ncruelty; she has forgotten her part, the play will go to pieces, and\ngood-day to the engagement at the Gymnase which Camusot had planned\nfor her.\"\n\n\"Pooh! . . . Poor thing!\" said Lucien. Every instinct of vanity was\ntickled by the words; he felt his heart swell high with self-conceit.\n\"More adventures have befallen me in this one evening, my dear fellow,\nthan in all the first eighteen years of my life.\" And Lucien related\nthe history of his love affairs with Mme. de Bargeton, and of the\ncordial hatred he bore the Baron du Chatelet.\n\n\"Stay though! the newspaper wants a _bete noire_; we will take him up.\nThe Baron is a buck of the Empire and a Ministerialist; he is the man\nfor us; I have seen him many a time at the Opera. I can see your great\nlady as I sit here; she is often in the Marquise d'Espard's box. The\nBaron is paying court to your lady love, a cuttlefish bone that she\nis. Wait! Finot has just sent a special messenger round to say that\nthey are short of copy at the office. Young Hector Merlin has left\nthem in the lurch because they did not pay for white lines. Finot, in\ndespair, is knocking off an article against the Opera. Well now, my\ndear fellow, you can do this play; listen to it and think it over, and\nI will go to the manager's office and think out three columns about\nyour man and your disdainful fair one. They will be in no pleasant\npredicament to-morrow.\"\n\n\"So this is how a newspaper is written?\" said Lucien.\n\n\"It is always like this,\" answered Lousteau. \"These ten months that I\nhave been a journalist, they have always run short of copy at eight\no'clock in the evening.\"\n\nManuscript sent to the printer is spoken of as \"copy,\" doubtless\nbecause the writers are supposed to send in a fair copy of their work;\nor possibly the word is ironically derived from the Latin word _copia_,\nfor copy is invariably scarce.\n\n\"We always mean to have a few numbers ready in advance, a grand idea\nthat will never be realized,\" continued Lousteau. \"It is ten o'clock,\nyou see, and not a line has been written. I shall ask Vernou and\nNathan for a score of epigrams on deputies, or on 'Chancellor Cruzoe,'\nor on the Ministry, or on friends of ours if it needs must be. A man\nin this pass would slaughter his parent, just as a privateer will load\nhis guns with silver pieces taken out of the booty sooner than perish.\nWrite a brilliant article, and you will make brilliant progress in\nFinot's estimation; for Finot has a lively sense of benefits to come,\nand that sort of gratitude is better than any kind of pledge,\npawntickets always excepted, for they invariably represent something\nsolid.\"\n\n\"What kind of men can journalists be? Are you to sit down at a table\nand be witty to order?\"\n\n\"Just exactly as a lamp begins to burn when you apply a match--so long\nas there is any oil in it.\"\n\nLousteau's hand was on the lock when du Bruel came in with the\nmanager.\n\n\"Permit me, monsieur, to take a message to Coralie; allow me to tell\nher that you will go home with her after supper, or my play will be\nruined. The wretched girl does not know what she is doing or saying;\nshe will cry when she ought to laugh and laugh when she ought to cry.\nShe has been hissed once already. You can still save the piece, and,\nafter all, pleasure is not a misfortune.\"\n\n\"I am not accustomed to rivals, sir,\" Lucien answered.\n\n\"Pray don't tell her that!\" cried the manager. \"Coralie is just the\ngirl to fling Camusot overboard and ruin herself in good earnest. The\nproprietor of the _Golden Cocoon_, worthy man, allows her two thousand\nfrancs a month, and pays for all her dresses and _claqueurs_.\"\n\n\"As your promise pledges me to nothing, save your play,\" said Lucien,\nwith a sultan's airs.\n\n\"But don't look as if you meant to snub that charming creature,\"\npleaded du Bruel.\n\n\"Dear me! am I to write the notice of your play and smile on your\nheroine as well?\" exclaimed the poet.\n\nThe author vanished with a signal to Coralie, who began to act\nforthwith in a marvelous way. Vignol, who played the part of the\nalcalde, and revealed for the first time his genius as an actor of old\nmen, came forward amid a storm of applause to make an announcement to\nthe house.\n\n\"The piece which we have the honor of playing for you this evening,\ngentlemen, is the work of MM. Raoul and de Cursy.\"\n\n\"Why, Nathan is partly responsible,\" said Lousteau. \"I don't wonder\nthat he looked in.\"\n\n\"Coralie_! Coralie_!\" shouted the enraptured house. \"Florine, too!\"\nroared a voice of thunder from the opposite box, and other voices took\nup the cry, \"Florine and Coralie!\"\n\nThe curtain rose, Vignol reappeared between the two actresses; Matifat\nand Camusot flung wreaths on the stage, and Coralie stooped for her\nflowers and held them out to Lucien.\n\nFor him those two hours spent in the theatre seemed to be a dream. The\nspell that held him had begun to work when he went behind the scenes;\nand, in spite of its horrors, the atmosphere of the place, its\nsensuality and dissolute morals had affected the poet's still\nuntainted nature. A sort of malaria that infects the soul seems to\nlurk among those dark, filthy passages filled with machinery, and lit\nwith smoky, greasy lamps. The solemnity and reality of life disappear,\nthe most sacred things are matter for a jest, the most impossible\nthings seem to be true. Lucien felt as if he had taken some narcotic,\nand Coralie had completed the work. He plunged into this joyous\nintoxication.\n\nThe lights in the great chandelier were extinguished; there was no one\nleft in the house except the boxkeepers, busy taking away footstools\nand shutting doors, the noises echoing strangely through the empty\ntheatre. The footlights, blown out as one candle, sent up a fetid reek\nof smoke. The curtain rose again, a lantern was lowered from the\nceiling, and firemen and stage carpenters departed on their rounds.\nThe fairy scenes of the stage, the rows of fair faces in the boxes,\nthe dazzling lights, the magical illusion of new scenery and costume\nhad all disappeared, and dismal darkness, emptiness, and cold reigned\nin their stead. It was hideous. Lucien sat on in bewilderment.\n\n\"Well! are you coming, my boy?\" Lousteau's voice called from the\nstage. \"Jump down.\"\n\nLucien sprang over. He scarcely recognized Florine and Coralie in\ntheir ordinary quilted paletots and cloaks, with their faces hidden by\nhats and thick black veils. Two butterflies returned to the chrysalis\nstage could not be more completely transformed.\n\n\"Will you honor me by giving me your arm?\" Coralie asked tremulously.\n\n\"With pleasure,\" said Lucien. He could feel the beating of her heart\nthrobbing against his like some snared bird as she nestled closely to\nhis side, with something of the delight of a cat that rubs herself\nagainst her master with eager silken caresses.\n\n\"So we are supping together!\" she said.\n\nThe party of four found two cabs waiting for them at the door in the\nRue des Fosses-du-Temple. Coralie drew Lucien to one of the two, in\nwhich Camusot and his father-in-law old Cardot were seated already.\nShe offered du Bruel a fifth place, and the manager drove off with\nFlorine, Matifat, and Lousteau.\n\n\"These hackney cabs are abominable things,\" said Coralie.\n\n\"Why don't you have a carriage?\" returned du Bruel.\n\n\"_Why_?\" she asked pettishly. \"I do not like to tell you before M.\nCardot's face; for he trained his son-in-law, no doubt. Would you\nbelieve it, little and old as he is, M. Cardot only gives Florine five\nhundred francs a month, just about enough to pay for her rent and her\ngrub and her clothes. The old Marquis de Rochegude offered me a\nbrougham two months ago, and he has six hundred thousand francs a\nyear, but I am an artist and not a common hussy.\"\n\n\"You shall have a carriage the day after to-morrow, miss,\" said\nCamusot benignly; \"you never asked me for one.\"\n\n\"As if one _asked_ for such a thing as that? What! you love a woman and\nlet her paddle about in the mud at the risk of breaking her legs?\nNobody but a knight of the yardstick likes to see a draggled skirt\nhem.\"\n\nAs she uttered the sharp words that cut Camusot to the quick, she\ngroped for Lucien's knee, and pressed it against her own, and clasped\nher fingers upon his hand. She was silent. All her power to feel\nseemed to be concentrated upon the ineffable joy of a moment which\nbrings compensation for the whole wretched past of a life such as\nthese poor creatures lead, and develops within their souls a poetry of\nwhich other women, happily ignorant of these violent revulsions, know\nnothing.\n\n\"You played like Mlle. Mars herself towards the end,\" said du Bruel.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Camusot, \"something put her out at the beginning; but from\nthe middle of the second act to the very end, she was enough to drive\nyou wild with admiration. Half of the success of your play was due to\nher.\"\n\n\"And half of her success is due to me,\" said du Bruel.\n\n\"This is all much ado about nothing,\" said Coralie in an unfamiliar\nvoice. And, seizing an opportunity in the darkness, she carried\nLucien's hand to her lips and kissed it and drenched it with tears.\nLucien felt thrilled through and through by that touch, for in the\nhumility of the courtesan's love there is a magnificence which might\nset an example to angels.\n\n\"Are you writing the dramatic criticism, monsieur?\" said du Bruel,\naddressing Lucien; \"you can write a charming paragraph about our dear\nCoralie.\"\n\n\"Oh! do us that little service!\" pleaded Camusot, down on his knees,\nmetaphorically speaking, before the critic. \"You will always find me\nready to do you a good turn at any time.\"\n\n\"Do leave him his independence,\" Coralie exclaimed angrily; \"he will\nwrite what he pleases. Papa Camusot, buy carriages for me instead of\npraises.\"\n\n\"You shall have them on very easy terms,\" Lucien answered politely. \"I\nhave never written for newspapers before, so I am not accustomed to\ntheir ways, my maiden pen is at your disposal----\"\n\n\"That is funny,\" said du Bruel.\n\n\"Here we are in the Rue de Bondy,\" said Cardot. Coralie's sally had\nquite crushed the little old man.\n\n\"If you are giving me the first fruits of your pen, the first love\nthat has sprung up in my heart shall be yours,\" whispered Coralie in\nthe brief instant that they remained alone together in the cab; then\nshe went up to Florine's bedroom to change her dress for a toilette\npreviously sent.\n\nLucien had no idea how lavishly a prosperous merchant will spend money\nupon an actress or a mistress when he means to enjoy a life of\npleasure. Matifat was not nearly so rich a man as his friend Camusot,\nand he had done his part rather shabbily, yet the sight of the\ndining-room took Lucien by surprise. The walls were hung with green\ncloth with a border of gilded nails, the whole room was artistically\ndecorated, lighted by handsome lamps, stands full of flowers stood in\nevery direction. The drawing-room was resplendent with the furniture\nin fashion in those days--a Thomire chandelier, a carpet of Eastern\ndesign, and yellow silken hangings relieved by a brown border. The\ncandlesticks, fire-irons, and clock were all in good taste; for\nMatifat had left everything to Grindot, a rising architect, who was\nbuilding a house for him, and the young man had taken great pains with\nthe rooms when he knew that Florine was to occupy them.\n\nMatifat, a tradesman to the backbone, went about carefully, afraid to\ntouch the new furniture; he seemed to have the totals of the bills\nalways before his eyes, and to look upon the splendors about him as so\nmuch jewelry imprudently withdrawn from the case.\n\n\"And I shall be obliged to do as much for Florentine!\" old Cardot's\neyes seemed to say.\n\nLucien at once began to understand Lousteau's indifference to the\nstate of his garret. Etienne was the real king of these festivals;\nEtienne enjoyed the use of all these fine things. He was standing just\nnow on the hearthrug with his back to the fire, as if he were the\nmaster of the house, chatting with the manager, who was congratulating\ndu Bruel.\n\n\"Copy, copy!\" called Finot, coming into the room. \"There is nothing in\nthe box; the printers are setting up my article, and they will soon\nhave finished.\"\n\n\"We will manage,\" said Etienne. \"There is a fire burning in Florine's\nboudoir; there is a table there; and if M. Matifat will find us paper\nand ink, we will knock off the newspaper while Florine and Coralie are\ndressing.\"\n\nCardot, Camusot, and Matifat disappeared in search of quills,\npenknives, and everything necessary. Suddenly the door was flung open,\nand Tullia, one of the prettiest opera-dancers of the day, dashed into\nthe room.\n\n\"They agree to take the hundred copies, dear boy!\" she cried,\naddressing Finot; \"they won't cost the management anything, for the\nchorus and the orchestra and the _corps de ballet_ are to take them\nwhether they like it or not; but your paper is so clever that nobody\nwill grumble. And you are going to have your boxes. Here is the\nsubscription for the first quarter,\" she continued, holding out a\ncouple of banknotes; \"so don't cut me up!\"\n\n\"It is all over with me!\" groaned Finot; \"I must suppress my\nabominable diatribe, and I haven't another notion in my head.\"\n\n\"What a happy inspiration, divine Lais!\" exclaimed Blondet, who had\nfollowed the lady upstairs and brought Nathan, Vernou and Claude\nVignon with him. \"Stop to supper, there is a dear, or I will crush\nthee, butterfly as thou art. There will be no professional jealousies,\nas you are a dancer; and as to beauty, you have all of you too much\nsense to show jealousy in public.\"\n\n\"Oh dear!\" cried Finot, \"Nathan, Blondet, du Bruel, help friends! I\nwant five columns.\"\n\n\"I can make two of the play,\" said Lucien.\n\n\"I have enough for one,\" added Lousteau.\n\n\"Very well; Nathan, Vernou, and du Bruel will make the jokes at the\nend; and Blondet, good fellow, surely will vouchsafe a couple of short\ncolumns for the first sheet. I will run round to the printer. It is\nlucky that you brought your carriage, Tullia.\"\n\n\"Yes, but the Duke is waiting below in it, and he has a German\nMinister with him.\"\n\n\"Ask the Duke and the Minister to come up,\" said Nathan.\n\n\"A German? They are the ones to drink, and they listen too; he shall\nhear some astonishing things to send home to his Government,\" cried\nBlondet.\n\n\"Is there any sufficiently serious personage to go down to speak to\nhim?\" asked Finot. \"Here, du Bruel, you are an official; bring up the\nDuc de Rhetore and the Minister, and give your arm to Tullia. Dear me!\nTullia, how handsome you are to-night!\"\n\n\"We shall be thirteen at table!\" exclaimed Matifat, paling visibly.\n\n\"No, fourteen,\" said a voice in the doorway, and Florentine appeared.\n\"I have come to look after 'milord Cardot,'\" she added, speaking with\na burlesque English accent.\n\n\"And besides,\" said Lousteau, \"Claude Vignon came with Blondet.\"\n\n\"I brought him here to drink,\" returned Blondet, taking up an\ninkstand. \"Look here, all of you, you must use all your wit before\nthose fifty-six bottles of wine drive it out. And, of all things, stir\nup du Bruel; he is a vaudevillist, he is capable of making bad jokes\nif you get him to concert pitch.\"\n\nAnd Lucien wrote his first newspaper article at the round table in\nFlorine's boudoir, by the light of the pink candles lighted by\nMatifat; before such a remarkable audience he was eager to show what\nhe could do.\n\n\n                    THE PANORAMA-DRAMATIQUE.\n\n  First performance of the _Alcalde in a Fix_, an imbroglio in three\n  acts.--First appearance of Mademoiselle Florine.--Mademoiselle\n  Coralie.--Vignol.\n\n\n  People are coming and going, walking and talking, everybody is\n  looking for something, nobody finds anything. General hubbub. The\n  Alcalde has lost his daughter and found his cap, but the cap does\n  not fit; it must belong to some thief. Where is the thief? People\n  walk and talk, and come and go more than ever. Finally the Alcalde\n  finds a man without his daughter, and his daughter without the\n  man, which is satisfactory for the magistrate, but not for the\n  audience. Quiet being resorted, the Alcalde tries to examine the\n  man. Behold a venerable Alcalde, sitting in an Alcalde's great\n  armchair, arranging the sleeves of his Alcalde's gown. Only in\n  Spain do Alcaldes cling to their enormous sleeves and wear plaited\n  lawn ruffles about the magisterial throat, a good half of an\n  Alcalde's business on the stage in Paris. This particular Alcalde,\n  wheezing and waddling about like an asthmatic old man, is Vignol,\n  on whom Potier's mantle has fallen; a young actor who personates\n  old age so admirably that the oldest men in the audience cannot\n  help laughing. With that quavering voice of his, that bald\n  forehead, and those spindle shanks trembling under the weight of a\n  senile frame, he may look forward to a long career of decrepitude.\n  There is something alarming about the young actor's old age; he is\n  so very old; you feel nervous lest senility should be infectious.\n  And what an admirable Alcalde he makes! What a delightful, uneasy\n  smile! what pompous stupidity! what wooden dignity! what judicial\n  hesitation! How well the man knows that black may be white, or\n  white black! How eminently well he is fitted to be Minister to a\n  constitutional monarch! The stranger answers every one of his\n  inquiries by a question; Vignol retorts in such a fashion, that\n  the person under examination elicits all the truth from the\n  Alcalde. This piece of pure comedy, with a breath of Moliere\n  throughout, puts the house in good humor. The people on the stage\n  all seemed to understand what they were about, but I am quite\n  unable to clear up the mystery, or to say wherein it lay; for the\n  Alcalde's daughter was there, personified by a living, breathing\n  Andalusian, a Spaniard with a Spaniard's eyes, a Spaniard's\n  complexion, a Spaniard's gait and figure, a Spaniard from top to\n  toe, with her poniard in her garter, love in her heart, and a\n  cross on the ribbon about her neck. When the act was over, and\n  somebody asked me how the piece was going, I answered, \"She wears\n  scarlet stockings with green clocks to them; she has a little\n  foot, no larger than _that_, in her patent leather shoes, and the\n  prettiest pair of ankles in Andalusia!\" Oh! that Alcalde's\n  daughter brings your heart into your mouth; she tantalizes you so\n  horribly, that you long to spring upon the stage and offer her\n  your thatched hovel and your heart, or thirty thousand livres per\n  annum and your pen. The Andalusian is the loveliest actress in\n  Paris. Coralie, for she must be called by her real name, can be a\n  countess or a _grisette_, and in which part she would be more\n  charming one cannot tell. She can be anything that she chooses;\n  she is born to achieve all possibilities; can more be said of a\n  boulevard actress?\n\n  With the second act, a Parisian Spaniard appeared upon the scene,\n  with her features cut like a cameo and her dangerous eyes. \"Where\n  does she come from?\" I asked in my turn, and was told that she\n  came from the greenroom, and that she was Mademoiselle Florine;\n  but, upon my word, I could not believe a syllable of it, such\n  spirit was there in her gestures, such frenzy in her love. She is\n  the rival of the Alcalde's daughter, and married to a grandee cut\n  out to wear an Almaviva's cloak, with stuff sufficient in it for a\n  hundred boulevard noblemen. Mlle. Florine wore neither scarlet\n  stockings with green clocks, nor patent leather shoes, but she\n  appeared in a mantilla, a veil which she put to admirable uses,\n  like the great lady that she is! She showed to admiration that the\n  tigress can be a cat. I began to understand, from the sparkling\n  talk between the two, that some drama of jealousy was going on;\n  and just as everything was put right, the Alcalde's stupidity\n  embroiled everybody again. Torchbearers, rich men, footmen,\n  Figaros, grandees, alcaldes, dames, and damsels--the whole company\n  on the stage began to eddy about, and come and go, and look for\n  one another. The plot thickened, again I left it to thicken; for\n  Florine the jealous and the happy Coralie had entangled me once\n  more in the folds of mantilla and basquina, and their little feet\n  were twinkling in my eyes.\n\n  I managed, however, to reach the third act without any mishap. The\n  commissary of police was not compelled to interfere, and I did\n  nothing to scandalize the house, wherefore I begin to believe in\n  the influence of that \"public and religious morality,\" about which\n  the Chamber of Deputies is so anxious, that any one might think\n  there was no morality left in France. I even contrived to gather\n  that a man was in love with two women who failed to return his\n  affection, or else that two women were in love with a man who\n  loved neither of them; the man did not love the Alcalde, or the\n  Alcalde had no love for the man, who was nevertheless a gallant\n  gentleman, and in love with somebody, with himself, perhaps, or\n  with heaven, if the worst came to the worst, for he becomes a\n  monk. And if you want to know any more, you can go to the\n  Panorama-Dramatique. You are hereby given fair warning--you must\n  go once to accustom yourself to those irresistible scarlet\n  stockings with the green clocks, to little feet full of promises,\n  to eyes with a ray of sunlight shining through them, to the subtle\n  charm of a Parisienne disguised as an Andalusian girl, and of an\n  Andalusian masquerading as a Parisienne. You must go a second time\n  to enjoy the play, to shed tears over the love-distracted grandee,\n  and die of laughing at the old Alcalde. The play is twice a\n  success. The author, who writes it, it is said, in collaboration\n  with one of the great poets of the day, was called before the\n  curtain, and appeared with a love-distraught damsel on each arm,\n  and fairly brought down the excited house. The two dancers seemed\n  to have more wit in their legs than the author himself; but when\n  once the fair rivals left the stage, the dialogue seemed witty at\n  once, a triumphant proof of the excellence of the piece. The\n  applause and calls for the author caused the architect some\n  anxiety; but M. de Cursy, the author, being accustomed to volcanic\n  eruptions of the reeling Vesuvius beneath the chandelier, felt no\n  tremor. As for the actresses, they danced the famous bolero of\n  Seville, which once found favor in the sight of a council of\n  reverend fathers, and escaped ecclesiastical censure in spite of\n  its wanton dangerous grace. The bolero in itself would be enough\n  to attract old age while there is any lingering heat of youth in\n  the veins, and out of charity I warn these persons to keep the\n  lenses of their opera-glasses well polished.\n\n\nWhile Lucien was writing a column which was to set a new fashion in\njournalism and reveal a fresh and original gift, Lousteau indited an\narticle of the kind described as _moeurs_--a sketch of contemporary\nmanners, entitled _The Elderly Beau_.\n\n\n\"The buck of the Empire,\" he wrote, \"is invariably long, slender, and\nwell preserved. He wears a corset and the Cross of the Legion of\nHonor. His name was originally Potelet, or something very like it; but\nto stand well with the Court, he conferred a _du_ upon himself, and\n_du_ Potelet he is until another revolution. A baron of the Empire, a\nman of two ends, as his name (_Potelet_, a post) implies, he is paying\nhis court to the Faubourg Saint-Germain, after a youth gloriously and\nusefully spent as the agreeable trainbearer of a sister of the man\nwhom decency forbids me to mention by name. Du Potelet has forgotten\nthat he was once in waiting upon Her Imperial Highness; but he still\nsings the songs composed for the benefactress who took such a tender\ninterest in his career,\" and so forth and so forth. It was a tissue of\npersonalities, silly enough for the most part, such as they used to\nwrite in those days. Other papers, and notably the _Figaro_, have\nbrought the art to a curious perfection since. Lousteau compared the\nBaron to a heron, and introduced Mme. de Bargeton, to whom he was\npaying his court, as a cuttlefish bone, a burlesque absurdity which\namused readers who knew neither of the personages. A tale of the loves\nof the Heron, who tried in vain to swallow the Cuttlefish bone, which\nbroke into three pieces when he dropped it, was irresistibly\nludicrous. Everybody remembers the sensation which the pleasantry made\nin the Faubourg Saint-Germain; it was the first of a series of similar\narticles, and was one of the thousand and one causes which provoked\nthe rigorous press legislation of Charles X.\n\nAn hour later, Blondet, Lousteau, and Lucien came back to the\ndrawing-room, where the other guests were chatting. The Duke was there\nand the Minister, the four women, the three merchants, the manager,\nand Finot. A printer's devil, with a paper cap on his head, was\nwaiting even then for copy.\n\n\"The men are just going off, if I have nothing to take them,\" he said.\n\n\"Stay a bit, here are ten francs, and tell them to wait,\" said Finot.\n\n\"If I give them the money, sir, they would take to tippleography, and\ngood-night to the newspaper.\"\n\n\"That boy's common-sense is appalling to me,\" remarked Finot; and the\nMinister was in the middle of a prediction of a brilliant future for\nthe urchin, when the three came in. Blondet read aloud an extremely\nclever article against the Romantics; Lousteau's paragraph drew\nlaughter, and by the Duc de Rhetore's advice an indirect eulogium of\nMme. d'Espard was slipped in, lest the whole Faubourg Saint-Germain\nshould take offence.\n\n\"What have _you_ written?\" asked Finot, turning to Lucien.\n\nAnd Lucien read, quaking for fear, but the room rang with applause\nwhen he finished; the actresses embraced the neophyte; and the two\nmerchants, following suit, half choked the breath out of him. There\nwere tears in du Bruel's eyes as he grasped his critic's hand, and the\nmanager invited him to dinner.\n\n\"There are no children nowadays,\" said Blondet. \"Since M. de\nChateaubriand called Victor Hugo a 'sublime child,' I can only tell\nyou quite simply that you have spirit and taste, and write like a\ngentleman.\"\n\n\"He is on the newspaper,\" said Finot, as he thanked Etienne, and gave\nhim a shrewd glance.\n\n\"What jokes have you made?\" inquired Lousteau, turning to Blondet and\ndu Bruel.\n\n\"Here are du Bruel's,\" said Nathan.\n\n\n  *** \"Now, that M. le Vicomte d'A---- is attracting so much\n  attention, they will perhaps let _me_ alone,\" M. le Vicomte\n  Demosthenes was heard to say yesterday.\n\n\n  *** An Ultra, condemning M. Pasquier's speech, said his programme\n  was only a continuation of Decaze's policy. \"Yes,\" said a lady,\n  \"but he stands on a Monarchical basis, he has just the kind of leg\n  for a Court suit.\"\n\n\n\"With such a beginning, I don't ask more of you,\" said Finot; \"it will\nbe all right.--Run round with this,\" he added, turning to the boy;\n\"the paper is not exactly a genuine article, but it is our best number\nyet,\" and he turned to the group of writers. Already Lucien's\ncolleagues were privately taking his measure.\n\n\"That fellow has brains,\" said Blondet.\n\n\"His article is well written,\" said Claude Vignon.\n\n\"Supper!\" cried Matifat.\n\nThe Duke gave his arm to Florine, Coralie went across to Lucien, and\nTullia went in to supper between Emile Blondet and the German\nMinister.\n\n\"I cannot understand why you are making an onslaught on Mme. de\nBargeton and the Baron du Chatelet; they say that he is\nprefect-designate of the Charente, and will be Master of Requests\nsome day.\"\n\n\"Mme. de Bargeton showed Lucien the door as if he had been an\nimposter,\" said Lousteau.\n\n\"Such a fine young fellow!\" exclaimed the Minister.\n\nSupper, served with new plate, Sevres porcelain, and white damask, was\nredolent of opulence. The dishes were from Chevet, the wines from a\ncelebrated merchant on the Quai Saint-Bernard, a personal friend of\nMatifat's. For the first time Lucien beheld the luxury of Paris\ndisplayed; he went from surprise to surprise, but he kept his\nastonishment to himself, like a man who had spirit and taste and wrote\nlike a gentleman, as Blondet had said.\n\nAs they crossed the drawing-room, Coralie bent to Florine, \"Make\nCamusot so drunk that he will be compelled to stop here all night,\"\nshe whispered.\n\n\"So you have hooked your journalist, have you?\" returned Florine,\nusing the idiom of women of her class.\n\n\"No, dear; I love him,\" said Coralie, with an adorable little shrug of\nthe shoulders.\n\nThose words rang in Lucien's ears, borne to them by the fifth deadly\nsin. Coralie was perfectly dressed. Every woman possesses some\npersonal charm in perfection, and Coralie's toilette brought her\ncharacteristic beauty into prominence. Her dress, moreover, like\nFlorine's, was of some exquisite stuff, unknown as yet to the public,\na _mousseline de soie_, with which Camusot had been supplied a few days\nbefore the rest of the world; for, as owner of the _Golden Cocoon_, he\nwas a kind of Providence in Paris to the Lyons silkweavers.\n\nLove and toilet are like color and perfume for a woman, and Coralie in\nher happiness looked lovelier than ever. A looked-for delight which\ncannot elude the grasp possesses an immense charm for youth; perhaps\nin their eyes the secret of the attraction of a house of pleasure lies\nin the certainty of gratification; perhaps many a long fidelity is\nattributable to the same cause. Love for love's sake, first love\nindeed, had blent with one of the strange violent fancies which\nsometimes possess these poor creatures; and love and admiration of\nLucien's great beauty taught Coralie to express the thoughts in her\nheart.\n\n\"I should love you if you were ill and ugly,\" she whispered as they\nsat down.\n\nWhat a saying for a poet! Camusot utterly vanished, Lucien had\nforgotten his existence, he saw Coralie, and had eyes for nothing\nelse. How should he draw back--this creature, all sensation, all\nenjoyment of life, tired of the monotony of existence in a country\ntown, weary of poverty, harassed by enforced continence, impatient of\nthe claustral life of the Rue de Cluny, of toiling without reward? The\nfascination of the under world of Paris was upon him; how should he\nrise and leave this brilliant gathering? Lucien stood with one foot in\nCoralie's chamber and the other in the quicksands of Journalism. After\nso much vain search, and climbing of so many stairs, after standing\nabout and waiting in the Rue de Sentier, he had found Journalism a\njolly boon companion, joyous over the wine. His wrongs had just been\navenged. There were two for whom he had vainly striven to fill the cup\nof humiliation and pain which he had been made to drink to the dregs,\nand now to-morrow they should receive a stab in their very hearts.\n\"Here is a real friend!\" he thought, as he looked at Lousteau. It\nnever crossed his mind that Lousteau already regarded him as a\ndangerous rival. He had made a blunder; he had done his very best when\na colorless article would have served him admirably well. Blondet's\nremark to Finot that it would be better to come to terms with a man of\nthat calibre, had counteracted Lousteau's gnawing jealousy. He\nreflected that it would be prudent to keep on good terms with Lucien,\nand, at the same time, to arrange with Finot to exploit this\nformidable newcomer--he must be kept in poverty. The decision was made\nin a moment, and the bargain made in a few whispered words.\n\n\"He has talent.\"\n\n\"He will want the more.\"\n\n\"Ah?\"\n\n\"Good!\"\n\n\"A supper among French journalists always fills me with dread,\" said\nthe German diplomatist, with serene urbanity; he looked as he spoke at\nBlondet, whom he had met at the Comtesse de Montcornet's. \"It is laid\nupon you, gentlemen, to fulfil a prophecy of Blucher's.\"\n\n\"What prophecy?\" asked Nathan.\n\n\"When Blucher and Sacken arrived on the heights of Montmartre in 1814\n(pardon me, gentlemen, for recalling a day unfortunate for France),\nSacken (a rough brute), remarked, 'Now we will set Paris alight!'\n--'Take very good care that you don't,' said Blucher. 'France will die\nof _that_, nothing else can kill her,' and he waved his hand over the\nglowing, seething city, that lay like a huge canker in the valley of\nthe Seine.--There are no journalists in our country, thank Heaven!\"\ncontinued the Minister after a pause. \"I have not yet recovered from\nthe fright that the little fellow gave me, a boy of ten, in a paper\ncap, with the sense of an old diplomatist. And to-night I feel as if I\nwere supping with lions and panthers, who graciously sheathe their\nclaws in my honor.\"\n\n\"It is clear,\" said Blondet, \"that we are at liberty to inform Europe\nthat a serpent dropped from your Excellency's lips this evening, and\nthat the venomous creature failed to inoculate Mlle. Tullia, the\nprettiest dancer in Paris; and to follow up the story with a\ncommentary on Eve, and the Scriptures, and the first and last\ntransgression. But have no fear, you are our guest.\"\n\n\"It would be funny,\" said Finot.\n\n\"We would begin with a scientific treatise on all the serpents found\nin the human heart and human body, and so proceed to the _corps\ndiplomatique_,\" said Lousteau.\n\n\"And we could exhibit one in spirits, in a bottle of brandied\ncherries,\" said Vernou.\n\n\"Till you yourself would end by believing in the story,\" added Vignon,\nlooking at the diplomatist.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" cried the Duc de Rhetore, \"let sleeping claws lie.\"\n\n\"The influence and power of the press is only dawning,\" said Finot.\n\"Journalism is in its infancy; it will grow. In ten years' time,\neverything will be brought into publicity. The light of thought will\nbe turned on all subjects, and----\"\n\n\"The blight of thought will be over it all,\" corrected Blondet.\n\n\"Here is an apothegm,\" cried Claude Vignon.\n\n\"Thought will make kings,\" said Lousteau.\n\n\"And undo monarchs,\" said the German.\n\n\"And therefore,\" said Blondet, \"if the press did not exist, it would\nbe necessary to invent it forthwith. But here we have it, and live by\nit.\"\n\n\"You will die of it,\" returned the German diplomatist. \"Can you not\nsee that if you enlighten the masses, and raise them in the political\nscale, you make it all the harder for the individual to rise above\ntheir level? Can you not see that if you sow the seeds of reasoning\namong the working-classes, you will reap revolt, and be the first to\nfall victims? What do they smash in Paris when a riot begins?\"\n\n\"The street-lamps!\" said Nathan; \"but we are too modest to fear for\nourselves, we only run the risk of cracks.\"\n\n\"As a nation, you have too much mental activity to allow any\ngovernment to run its course without interference. But for that, you\nwould make the conquest of Europe a second time, and win with the pen\nall that you failed to keep with the sword.\"\n\n\"Journalism is an evil,\" said Claude Vignon. \"The evil may have its\nuses, but the present Government is resolved to put it down. There\nwill be a battle over it. Who will give way? That is the question.\"\n\n\"The Government will give way,\" said Blondet. \"I keep telling people\nthat with all my might! Intellectual power is _the_ great power in\nFrance; and the press has more wit than all men of intellect put\ntogether, and the hypocrisy of Tartufe besides.\"\n\n\"Blondet! Blondet! you are going too far!\" called Finot. \"Subscribers\nare present.\"\n\n\"You are the proprietor of one of those poison shops; you have reason\nto be afraid; but I can laugh at the whole business, even if I live by\nit.\"\n\n\"Blondet is right,\" said Claude Vignon. \"Journalism, so far from being\nin the hands of a priesthood, came to be first a party weapon, and\nthen a commercial speculation, carried on without conscience or\nscruple, like other commercial speculations. Every newspaper, as\nBlondet says, is a shop to which people come for opinions of the right\nshade. If there were a paper for hunchbacks, it would set forth\nplainly, morning and evening, in its columns, the beauty, the utility,\nand necessity of deformity. A newspaper is not supposed to enlighten\nits readers, but to supply them with congenial opinions. Give any\nnewspaper time enough, and it will be base, hypocritical, shameless,\nand treacherous; the periodical press will be the death of ideas,\nsystems, and individuals; nay, it will flourish upon their decay. It\nwill take the credit of all creations of the brain; the harm that it\ndoes is done anonymously. We, for instance--I, Claude Vignon; you,\nBlondet; you, Lousteau; and you, Finot--we are all Platos, Aristides,\nand Catos, Plutarch's men, in short; we are all immaculate; we may\nwash our hands of all iniquity. Napoleon's sublime aphorism, suggested\nby his study of the Convention, 'No one individual is responsible for\na crime committed collectively,' sums up the whole significance of a\nphenomenon, moral or immoral, whichever you please. However shamefully\na newspaper may behave, the disgrace attaches to no one person.\"\n\n\"The authorities will resort to repressive legislation,\" interposed du\nBruel. \"A law is going to be passed, in fact.\"\n\n\"Pooh!\" retorted Nathan. \"What is the law in France against the spirit\nin which it is received, the most subtle of all solvents?\"\n\n\"Ideas and opinions can only be counteracted by opinions and ideas,\"\nVignon continued. \"By sheer terror and despotism, and by no other\nmeans, can you extinguish the genius of the French nation; for the\nlanguage lends itself admirably to allusion and ambiguity. Epigram\nbreaks out the more for repressive legislation; it is like steam in an\nengine without a safety-valve.--The King, for example, does right; if\na newspaper is against him, the Minister gets all the credit of the\nmeasure, and _vice versa_. A newspaper invents a scandalous libel--it\nhas been misinformed. If the victim complains, the paper gets off with\nan apology for taking so great a freedom. If the case is taken into\ncourt, the editor complains that nobody asked him to rectify the\nmistake; but ask for redress, and he will laugh in your face and treat\nhis offence as a mere trifle. The paper scoffs if the victim gains the\nday; and if heavy damages are awarded, the plaintiff is held up as an\nunpatriotic obscurantist and a menace to the liberties of the country.\nIn the course of an article purporting to explain that Monsieur\nSo-and-so is as honest a man as you will find in the kingdom, you are\ninformed that he is not better than a common thief. The sins of the\npress? Pooh! mere trifles; the curtailers of its liberties are\nmonsters; and give him time enough, the constant reader is persuaded\nto believe anything you please. Everything which does not suit the\nnewspaper will be unpatriotic, and the press will be infallible. One\nreligion will be played off against another, and the Charter against\nthe King. The press will hold up the magistracy to scorn for meting\nout rigorous justice to the press, and applaud its action when it\nserves the cause of party hatred. The most sensational fictions will\nbe invented to increase the circulation; Journalism will descend to\nmountebanks' tricks worthy of Bobeche; Journalism would serve up its\nfather with the Attic salt of its own wit sooner than fail to interest\nor amuse the public; Journalism will outdo the actor who put his son's\nashes into the urn to draw real tears from his eyes, or the mistress\nwho sacrifices everything to her lover.\"\n\n\"Journalism is, in fact, the People in folio form,\" interrupted\nBlondet.\n\n\"The people with hypocrisy added and generosity lacking,\" said Vignon.\n\"All real ability will be driven out from the ranks of Journalism, as\nAristides was driven into exile by the Athenians. We shall see\nnewspapers started in the first instance by men of honor, falling\nsooner or later into the hands of men of abilities even lower than the\naverage, but endowed with the resistance of flexibility of\nindia-rubber, qualities denied to noble genius; nay, perhaps the future\nnewspaper proprietor will be the tradesman with capital sufficient to\nbuy venal pens. We see such things already indeed, but in ten years'\ntime every little youngster that has left school will take himself for\na great man, slash his predecessors from the lofty height of a\nnewspaper column, drag them down by the feet, and take their place.\n\n\"Napoleon did wisely when he muzzled the press. I would wager that the\nOpposition papers would batter down a government of their own setting\nup, just as they are battering the present government, if any demand\nwas refused. The more they have, the more they will want in the way of\nconcessions. The _parvenu_ journalist will be succeeded by the\nstarveling hack. There is no salve for this sore. It is a kind of\ncorruption which grows more and more obtrusive and malignant; the\nwider it spreads, the more patiently it will be endured, until the day\ncomes when newspapers shall so increase and multiply in the earth that\nconfusion will be the result--a second Babel. We, all of us, such as\nwe are, have reason to know that crowned kings are less ungrateful\nthan kings of our profession; that the most sordid man of business is\nnot so mercenary nor so keen in speculation; that our brains are\nconsumed to furnish their daily supply of poisonous trash. And yet we,\nall of us, shall continue to write, like men who work in quicksilver\nmines, knowing that they are doomed to die of their trade.\n\n\"Look there,\" he continued, \"at that young man sitting beside Coralie\n--what is his name? Lucien! He has a beautiful face; he is a poet; and\nwhat is more, he is witty--so much the better for him. Well, he will\ncross the threshold of one of those dens where a man's intellect is\nprostituted; he will put all his best and finest thought into his\nwork; he will blunt his intellect and sully his soul; he will be\nguilty of anonymous meannesses which take the place of stratagem,\npillage, and ratting to the enemy in the warfare of _condottieri_. And\nwhen, like hundreds more, he has squandered his genius in the service\nof others who find the capital and do no work, those dealers in\npoisons will leave him to starve if he is thirsty, and to die of\nthirst if he is starving.\"\n\n\"Thanks,\" said Finot.\n\n\"But, dear me,\" continued Claude Vignon, \"_I_ knew all this, yet here\nam I in the galleys, and the arrival of another convict gives me\npleasure. We are cleverer, Blondet and I, than Messieurs This and\nThat, who speculate in our abilities, yet nevertheless we are always\nexploited by them. We have a heart somewhere beneath the intellect; we\nhave NOT the grim qualities of the man who makes others work for him.\nWe are indolent, we like to look on at the game, we are meditative,\nand we are fastidious; they will sweat our brains and blame us for\nimprovidence.\"\n\n\"I thought you would be more amusing than this!\" said Florine.\n\n\"Florine is right,\" said Blondet; \"let us leave the cure of public\nevils to those quacks the statesmen. As Charlet says, 'Quarrel with my\nown bread and butter? _Never_!'\"\n\n\"Do you know what Vignon puts me in mind of?\" said Lousteau. \"Of one\nof those fat women in the Rue du Pelican telling a schoolboy, 'My boy,\nyou are too young to come here.'\"\n\nA burst of laughter followed the sally, but it pleased Coralie. The\nmerchants meanwhile ate and drank and listened.\n\n\"What a nation this is! You see so much good in it and so much evil,\"\nsaid the Minister, addressing the Duc de Rhetore.--\"You are prodigals\nwho cannot ruin yourselves, gentlemen.\"\n\nAnd so, by the blessing of chance, Lucien, standing on the brink of\nthe precipice over which he was destined to fall, heard warnings on\nall sides. D'Arthez had set him on the right road, had shown him the\nnoble method of work, and aroused in him the spirit before which all\nobstacles disappear. Lousteau himself (partly from selfish motives)\nhad tried to warn him away by describing Journalism and Literature in\ntheir practical aspects. Lucien had refused to believe that there\ncould be so much hidden corruption; but now he had heard the\njournalists themselves crying woe for their hurt, he had seen them at\ntheir work, had watched them tearing their foster-mother's heart to\nread auguries of the future.\n\nThat evening he had seen things as they are. He beheld the very\nheart's core of corruption of that Paris which Blucher so aptly\ndescribed; and so far from shuddering at the sight, he was intoxicated\nwith enjoyment of the intellectually stimulating society in which he\nfound himself.\n\nThese extraordinary men, clad in armor damascened by their vices,\nthese intellects environed by cold and brilliant analysis, seemed so\nfar greater in his eyes than the grave and earnest members of the\nbrotherhood. And besides all this, he was reveling in his first taste\nof luxury; he had fallen under the spell. His capricious instincts\nawoke; for the first time in his life he drank exquisite wines, this\nwas his first experience of cookery carried to the pitch of a fine\nart. A minister, a duke, and an opera-dancer had joined the party of\njournalists, and wondered at their sinister power. Lucien felt a\nhorrible craving to reign over these kings, and he thought that he had\npower to win his kingdom. Finally, there was this Coralie, made happy\nby a few words of his. By the bright light of the wax-candles, through\nthe steam of the dishes and the fumes of wine, she looked sublimely\nbeautiful to his eyes, so fair had she grown with love. She was the\nloveliest, the most beautiful actress in Paris. The brotherhood, the\nheaven of noble thoughts, faded away before a temptation that appealed\nto every fibre of his nature. How could it have been otherwise?\nLucien's author's vanity had just been gratified by the praises of\nthose who know; by the appreciation of his future rivals; the success\nof his articles and his conquest of Coralie might have turned an older\nhead than his.\n\nDuring the discussion, moreover, every one at table had made a\nremarkably good supper, and such wines are not met with every day.\nLousteau, sitting beside Camusot, furtively poured cherry-brandy\nseveral times into his neighbor's wineglass, and challenged him to\ndrink. And Camusot drank, all unsuspicious, for he thought himself, in\nhis own way, a match for a journalist. The jokes became more personal\nwhen dessert appeared and the wine began to circulate. The German\nMinister, a keen-witted man of the world, made a sign to the Duke and\nTullia, and the three disappeared with the first symptoms of\nvociferous nonsense which precede the grotesque scenes of an orgy in\nits final stage. Coralie and Lucien had been behaving like children\nall the evening; as soon as the wine was uppermost in Camusot's head,\nthey made good their escape down the staircase and sprang into a cab.\nCamusot subsided under the table; Matifat, looking round for him,\nthought that he had gone home with Coralie, left his guests to smoke,\nlaugh, and argue, and followed Florine to her room. Daylight surprised\nthe party, or more accurately, the first dawn of light discovered one\nman still able to speak, and Blondet, that intrepid champion, was\nproposing to the assembled sleepers a health to Aurora the\nrosy-fingered.\n\nLucien was unaccustomed to orgies of this kind. His head was very\ntolerably clear as he came down the staircase, but the fresh air was\ntoo much for him; he was horribly drunk. When they reached the\nhandsome house in the Rue de Vendome, where the actress lived, Coralie\nand her waiting-woman were obliged to assist the poet to climb to the\nfirst floor. Lucien was ignominiously sick, and very nearly fainted on\nthe staircase.\n\n\"Quick, Berenice, some tea! Make some tea,\" cried Coralie.\n\n\"It is nothing; it is the air,\" Lucien got out, \"and I have never\ntaken so much before in my life.\"\n\n\"Poor boy! He is as innocent as a lamb,\" said Berenice, a stalwart\nNorman peasant woman as ugly as Coralie was pretty. Lucien, half\nunconscious, was laid at last in bed. Coralie, with Berenice's\nassistance, undressed the poet with all a mother's tender care.\n\n\"It is nothing,\" he murmured again and again. \"It is the air. Thank\nyou, mamma.\"\n\n\"How charmingly he says 'mamma,'\" cried Coralie, putting a kiss on\nhis hair.\n\n\"What happiness to love such an angel, mademoiselle! Where did you\npick him up? I did not think a man could be as beautiful as you are,\"\nsaid Berenice, when Lucien lay in bed. He was very drowsy; he knew\nnothing and saw nothing; Coralie made him swallow several cups of tea,\nand left him to sleep.\n\n\"Did the porter see us? Was there anyone else about?\" she asked.\n\n\"No; I was sitting up for you.\"\n\n\"Does Victoire know anything?\"\n\n\"Rather not!\" returned Berenice.\n\nTen hours later Lucien awoke to meet Coralie's eyes. She had watched\nby him as he slept; he knew it, poet that he was. It was almost noon,\nbut she still wore the delicate dress, abominably stained, which she\nmeant to lay up as a relic. Lucien understood all the self-sacrifice\nand delicacy of love, fain of its reward. He looked into Coralie's\neyes. In a moment she had flung off her clothing and slipped like a\nserpent to Lucien's side.\n\nAt five o'clock in the afternoon Lucien was still sleeping, cradled in\nthis voluptuous paradise. He had caught glimpses of Coralie's chamber,\nan exquisite creation of luxury, a world of rose-color and white. He\nhad admired Florine's apartments, but this surpassed them in its\ndainty refinement.\n\nCoralie had already risen; for if she was to play her part as the\nAndalusian, she must be at the theatre by seven o'clock. Yet she had\nreturned to gaze at the unconscious poet, lulled to sleep in bliss;\nshe could not drink too deeply of this love that rose to rapture,\ndrawing close the bond between the heart and the senses, to steep both\nin ecstasy. For in that apotheosis of human passion, which of those\nthat were twain on earth that they might know bliss to the full\ncreates one soul to rise to love in heaven, lay Coralie's\njustification. Who, moreover, would not have found excuse in Lucien's\nmore than human beauty? To the actress kneeling by the bedside, happy\nin love within her, it seemed that she had received love's\nconsecration. Berenice broke in upon Coralie's rapture.\n\n\"Here comes Camusot!\" cried the maid. \"And he knows that you are\nhere.\"\n\nLucien sprang up at once. Innate generosity suggested that he was\ndoing Coralie an injury. Berenice drew aside a curtain, and he fled\ninto a dainty dressing-room, whither Coralie and the maid brought his\nclothes with magical speed.\n\nCamusot appeared, and only then did Coralie's eyes alight on Lucien's\nboots, warming in the fender. Berenice had privately varnished them,\nand put them before the fire to dry; and both mistress and maid alike\nforgot that tell-tale witness. Berenice left the room with a scared\nglance at Coralie. Coralie flung herself into the depths of a settee,\nand bade Camusot seat himself in the _gondole_, a round-backed chair\nthat stood opposite. But Coralie's adorer, honest soul, dared not look\nhis mistress in the face; he could not take his eyes off the pair of\nboots.\n\n\"Ought I to make a scene and leave Coralie?\" he pondered. \"Is it worth\nwhile to make a fuss about a trifle? There is a pair of boots wherever\nyou go. These would be more in place in a shop window or taking a walk\non the boulevard on somebody's feet; here, however, without a pair of\nfeet in them, they tell a pretty plain tale. I am fifty years old, and\nthat is the truth; I ought to be as blind as Cupid himself.\"\n\nThere was no excuse for this mean-spirited monologue. The boots were\nnot the high-lows at present in vogue, which an unobservant man may be\nallowed to disregard up to a certain point. They were the\nunmistakable, uncompromising hessians then prescribed by fashion, a\npair of extremely elegant betasseled boots, which shone in glistening\ncontrast against tight-fitting trousers invariably of some light\ncolor, and reflected their surroundings like a mirror. The boots\nstared the honest silk-mercer out of countenance, and, it must be\nadded, they pained his heart.\n\n\"What is it?\" asked Coralie.\n\n\"Nothing.\"\n\n\"Ring the bell,\" said Coralie, smiling to herself at Camusot's want of\nspirit.--\"Berenice,\" she said, when the Norman handmaid appeared,\n\"just bring me a button-hook, for I must put on these confounded boots\nagain. Don't forget to bring them to my dressing-room to-night.\"\n\n\"What? . . . _your_ boots?\" . . . faltered out Camusot, breathing more\nfreely.\n\n\"And whose should they be?\" she demanded haughtily. \"Were you\nbeginning to believe?--great stupid! Oh! and he would believe it too,\"\nshe went on, addressing Berenice.--\"I have a man's part in\nWhat's-his-name's piece, and I have never worn a man's clothes in my\nlife before. The bootmaker for the theatre brought me these things to\ntry if I could walk in them, until a pair can be made to measure. He\nput them on, but they hurt me so much that I have taken them off, and\nafter all I must wear them.\"\n\n\"Don't put them on again if they are uncomfortable,\" said Camusot.\n(The boots had made him feel so very uncomfortable himself.)\n\n\"Mademoiselle would do better to have a pair made of very thin\nmorocco, sir, instead of torturing herself as she did just now; but\nthe management is so stingy. She was crying, sir; if I was a man and\nloved a woman, I wouldn't let her shed a tear, I know. You ought to\norder a pair for her----\"\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" said Camusot. \"Are you just getting up, Coralie?\"\n\n\"Just this moment; I only came in at six o'clock after looking for you\neverywhere. I was obliged to keep the cab for seven hours. So much for\nyour care of me; you forget me for a wine-bottle. I ought to take care\nof myself now when I am to play every night so long as the _Alcalde_\ndraws. I don't want to fall off after that young man's notice of me.\"\n\n\"That is a handsome boy,\" said Camusot.\n\n\"Do you think so? I don't admire men of that sort; they are too much\nlike women; and they do not understand how to love like you stupid old\nbusiness men. You are so bored with your own society.\"\n\n\"Is monsieur dining with madame?\" inquired Berenice.\n\n\"No, my mouth is clammy.\"\n\n\"You were nicely screwed yesterday. Ah! Papa Camusot, I don't like men\nwho drink, I tell you at once----\"\n\n\"You will give that young man a present, I suppose?\" interrupted\nCamusot.\n\n\"Oh! yes. I would rather do that than pay as Florine does. There, go\naway with you, good-for-nothing that one loves; or give me a carriage\nto save time in future.\"\n\n\"You shall go in your own carriage to-morrow to your manager's dinner\nat the _Rocher de Cancale_. The new piece will not be given next\nSunday.\"\n\n\"Come, I am just going to dine,\" said Coralie, hurrying Camusot out of\nthe room.\n\nAn hour later Berenice came to release Lucien. Berenice, Coralie's\ncompanion since her childhood, had a keen and subtle brain in her\nunwieldy frame.\n\n\"Stay here,\" she said. \"Coralie is coming back alone; she even talked\nof getting rid of Camusot if he is in your way; but you are too much\nof an angel to ruin her, her heart's darling as you are. She wants to\nclear out of this, she says; to leave this paradise and go and live in\nyour garret. Oh! there are those that are jealous and envious of you,\nand they have told her that you haven't a brass farthing, and live in\nthe Latin Quarter; and I should go, too, you see, to do the\nhouse-work.--But I have just been comforting her, poor child! I have\nbeen telling her that you were too clever to do anything so silly. I\nwas right, wasn't I, sir? Oh! you will see that you are her darling, her\nlove, the god to whom she gives her soul; yonder old fool has nothing\nbut the body.--If you only knew how nice she is when I hear her say\nher part over! My Coralie, my little pet, she is! She deserved that\nGod in heaven should send her one of His angels. She was sick of the\nlife.--She was so unhappy with her mother that used to beat her, and\nsold her. Yes, sir, sold her own child! If I had a daughter, I would\nwait on her hand and foot as I wait on Coralie; she is like my own\nchild to me.--These are the first good times she has seen since I have\nbeen with her; the first time that she has been really applauded. You\nhave written something, it seems, and they have got up a famous _claque_\nfor the second performance. Braulard has been going through the play\nwith her while you were asleep.\"\n\n\"Who? Braulard?\" asked Lucien; it seemed to him that he had heard the\nname before.\n\n\"He is the head of the _claqueurs_, and she was arranging with him the\nplaces where she wished him to look after her. Florine might try to\nplay her some shabby trick, and take all for herself, for all she\ncalls herself her friend. There is such a talk about your article on\nthe Boulevards.--Isn't it a bed fit for a prince,\" she said, smoothing\nthe lace bed-spread.\n\nShe lighted the wax-candles, and to Lucien's bewildered fancy, the\nhouse seemed to be some palace in the _Cabinet des Fees_. Camusot had\nchosen the richest stuffs from the _Golden Cocoon_ for the hangings and\nwindow-curtains. A carpet fit for a king's palace was spread upon the\nfloor. The carving of the rosewood furniture caught and imprisoned the\nlight that rippled over its surface. Priceless trifles gleamed from\nthe white marble chimney-piece. The rug beside the bed was of swan's\nskins bordered with sable. A pair of little, black velvet slippers\nlined with purple silk told of happiness awaiting the poet of _The\nMarguerites_. A dainty lamp hung from the ceiling draped with silk. The\nroom was full of flowering plants, delicate white heaths and scentless\ncamellias, in stands marvelously wrought. Everything called up\nassociations of innocence. How was it possible in these rooms to see\nthe life that Coralie led in its true colors? Berenice noticed\nLucien's bewildered expression.\n\n\"Isn't it nice?\" she said coaxingly. \"You would be more comfortable\nhere, wouldn't you, than in a garret?--You won't let her do anything\nrash?\" she continued, setting a costly stand before him, covered with\ndishes abstracted from her mistress' dinner-table, lest the cook\nshould suspect that her mistress had a lover in the house.\n\nLucien made a good dinner. Berenice waiting on him, the dishes were of\nwrought silver, the painted porcelain plates had cost a louis d'or\napiece. The luxury was producing exactly the same effect upon him that\nthe sight of a girl walking the pavement, with her bare flaunting\nthroat and neat ankles, produces upon a schoolboy.\n\n\"How lucky Camusot is!\" cried he.\n\n\"Lucky?\" repeated Berenice. \"He would willingly give all that he is\nworth to be in your place; he would be glad to barter his gray hair\nfor your golden head.\"\n\nShe gave Lucien the richest wine that Bordeaux keeps for the\nwealthiest English purchaser, and persuaded Lucien to go to bed to\ntake a preliminary nap; and Lucien, in truth, was quite willing to\nsleep on the couch that he had been admiring. Berenice had read his\nwish, and felt glad for her mistress.\n\nAt half-past ten that night Lucien awoke to look into eyes brimming\nover with love. There stood Coralie in most luxurious night attire.\nLucien had been sleeping; Lucien was intoxicated with love, and not\nwith wine. Berenice left the room with the inquiry, \"What time\nto-morrow morning?\"\n\n\"At eleven o'clock. We will have breakfast in bed. I am not at home to\nanybody before two o'clock.\"\n\nAt two o'clock in the afternoon Coralie and her lover were sitting\ntogether. The poet to all appearance had come to pay a call. Lucien\nhad been bathed and combed and dressed. Coralie had sent to\nColliau's for a dozen fine shirts, a dozen cravats and a dozen\npocket-handkerchiefs for him, as well as twelve pairs of gloves in\na cedar-wood box. When a carriage stopped at the door, they both\nrushed to the window, and watched Camusot alight from a handsome\ncoupe.\n\n\"I would not have believed that one could so hate a man and\nluxury----\"\n\n\"I am too poor to allow you to ruin yourself for me,\" he replied. And\nthus Lucien passed under the Caudine Forks.\n\n\"Poor pet,\" said Coralie, holding him tightly to her, \"do you love me\nso much?--I persuaded this gentleman to call on me this morning,\" she\ncontinued, indicating Lucien to Camusot, who entered the room. \"I\nthought that we might take a drive in the Champs Elysees to try the\ncarriage.\"\n\n\"Go without me,\" said Camusot in a melancholy voice; \"I shall not dine\nwith you. It is my wife's birthday, I had forgotten that.\"\n\n\"Poor Musot, how badly bored you will be!\" she said, putting her arms\nabout his neck.\n\nShe was wild with joy at the thought that she and Lucien would handsel\nthis gift together; she would drive with him in the new carriage; and\nin her happiness, she seemed to love Camusot, she lavished caresses\nupon him.\n\n\"If only I could give you a carriage every day!\" said the poor fellow.\n\n\"Now, sir, it is two o'clock,\" she said, turning to Lucien, who stood\nin distress and confusion, but she comforted him with an adorable\ngesture.\n\nDown the stairs she went, several steps at a time, drawing Lucien\nafter her; the elderly merchant following in their wake like a seal on\nland, and quite unable to catch them up.\n\nLucien enjoyed the most intoxicating of pleasures; happiness had\nincreased Coralie's loveliness to the highest possible degree; she\nappeared before all eyes an exquisite vision in her dainty toilette.\nAll Paris in the Champs Elysees beheld the lovers.\n\nIn an avenue of the Bois de Boulogne they met a caleche; Mme. d'Espard\nand Mme. de Bargeton looked in surprise at Lucien, and met a scornful\nglance from the poet. He saw glimpses of a great future before him,\nand was about to make his power felt. He could fling them back in a\nglance some of the revengeful thoughts which had gnawed his heart ever\nsince they planted them there. That moment was one of the sweetest in\nhis life, and perhaps decided his fate. Once again the Furies seized\non Lucien at the bidding of Pride. He would reappear in the world of\nParis; he would take a signal revenge; all the social pettiness\nhitherto trodden under foot by the worker, the member of the\nbrotherhood, sprang up again afresh in his soul.\n\nNow he understood all that Lousteau's attack had meant. Lousteau had\nserved his passions; while the brotherhood, that collective mentor,\nhad seemed to mortify them in the interests of tiresome virtues and\nwork which began to look useless and hopeless in Lucien's eyes. Work!\nWhat is it but death to an eager pleasure-loving nature? And how easy\nit is for the man of letters to slide into a _far niente_ existence of\nself-indulgence, into the luxurious ways of actresses and women of\neasy virtues! Lucien felt an overmastering desire to continue the\nreckless life of the last two days.\n\nThe dinner at the _Rocher de Cancale_ was exquisite. All Florine's\nsupper guests were there except the Minister, the Duke, and the\ndancer; Camusot, too, was absent; but these gaps were filled by two\nfamous actors and Hector Merlin and his mistress. This charming woman,\nwho chose to be known as Mme. du Val-Noble, was the handsomest and\nmost fashionable of the class of women now euphemistically styled\n_lorettes_.\n\nLucien had spent the forty-eight hours since the success of his\narticle in paradise. He was feted and envied; he gained\nself-possession; his talk sparkled; he was the brilliant Lucien de\nRubempre who shone for a few months in the world of letters and art.\nFinot, with his infallible instinct for discovering ability, scenting\nit afar as an ogre might scent human flesh, cajoled Lucien, and did\nhis best to secure a recruit for the squadron under his command. And\nCoralie watched the manoeuvres of this purveyor of brains, saw that\nLucien was nibbling at the bait, and tried to put him on his guard.\n\n\"Don't make any engagement, dear boy; wait. They want to exploit you;\nwe will talk of it to-night.\"\n\n\"Pshaw!\" said Lucien. \"I am sure I am quite as sharp and shrewd as\nthey can be.\"\n\nFinot and Hector Merlin evidently had not fallen out over that affair\nof the white lines and spaces in the columns, for it was Finot who\nintroduced Lucien to the journalist. Coralie and Mme. du Val-Noble\nwere overwhelmingly amiable and polite to each other, and Mme. du\nVal-Noble asked Lucien and Coralie to dine with her.\n\nHector Merlin, short and thin, with lips always tightly compressed,\nwas the most dangerous journalist present. Unbounded ambition and\njealousy smouldered within him; he took pleasure in the pain of\nothers, and fomented strife to turn it to his own account. His\nabilities were but slender, and he had little force of character, but\nthe natural instinct which draws the upstart towards money and power\nserved him as well as fixity of purpose. Lucien and Merlin at once\ntook a dislike to one another, for reasons not far to seek. Merlin,\nunfortunately, proclaimed aloud the thoughts that Lucien kept to\nhimself. By the time the dessert was put on the table, the most\ntouching friendship appeared to prevail among the men, each one of\nwhom in his heart thought himself a cleverer fellow than the rest; and\nLucien as the newcomer was made much of by them all. They chatted\nfrankly and unrestrainedly. Hector Merlin, alone, did not join in the\nlaughter. Lucien asked the reason of his reserve.\n\n\"You are just entering the world of letters, I can see,\" he said. \"You\nare a journalist with all your illusions left. You believe in\nfriendship. Here we are friends or foes, as it happens; we strike down\na friend with the weapon which by rights should only be turned against\nan enemy. You will find out, before very long, that fine sentiments\nwill do nothing for you. If you are naturally kindly, learn to be\nill-natured, to be consistently spiteful. If you have never heard this\ngolden rule before, I give it you now in confidence, and it is no\nsmall secret. If you have a mind to be loved, never leave your\nmistress until you have made her shed a tear or two; and if you mean\nto make your way in literature, let other people continually feel your\nteeth; make no exception even of your friends; wound their\nsusceptibilities, and everybody will fawn upon you.\"\n\nHector Merlin watched Lucien as he spoke, saw that his words went to\nthe neophyte's heart like a stab, and Hector Merlin was glad. Play\nfollowed, Lucien lost all his money, and Coralie brought him away; and\nhe forgot for a while, in the delights of love, the fierce excitement\nof the gambler, which was to gain so strong a hold upon him.\n\nWhen he left Coralie in the morning and returned to the Latin Quarter,\nhe took out his purse and found the money he had lost. At first he\nfelt miserable over the discovery, and thought of going back at once\nto return a gift which humiliated him; but--he had already come as far\nas the Rue de la Harpe; he would not return now that he had almost\nreached the Hotel de Cluny. He pondered over Coralie's forethought as\nhe went, till he saw in it a proof of the maternal love which is\nblended with passion in women of her stamp. For Coralie and her like,\npassion includes every human affection. Lucien went from thought to\nthought, and argued himself into accepting the gift. \"I love her,\" he\nsaid; \"we shall live together as husband and wife; I will never\nforsake her!\"\n\nWhat mortal, short of a Diogenes, could fail to understand Lucien's\nfeelings as he climbed the dirty, fetid staircase to his lodging,\nturned the key that grated in the lock, and entered and looked round\nat the unswept brick floor, at the cheerless grate, at the ugly\npoverty and bareness of the room.\n\nA package of manuscript was lying on the table. It was his novel; a\nnote from Daniel d'Arthez lay beside it:--\n\n\n  \"Our friends are almost satisfied with your work, dear poet,\"\n  d'Arthez wrote. \"You will be able to present it with more\n  confidence now, they say, to friends and enemies. We saw your\n  charming article on the Panorama-Dramatique; you are sure to\n  excite as much jealousy in the profession as regret among your\n  friends here.                                 DANIEL.\"\n\n\n\"Regrets! What does he mean?\" exclaimed Lucien. The polite tone of the\nnote astonished him. Was he to be henceforth a stranger to the\nbrotherhood? He had learned to set a higher value on the good opinion\nand the friendship of the circle in the Rue des Quatre-Vents since he\nhad tasted of the delicious fruits offered to him by the Eve of the\ntheatrical underworld. For some moments he stood in deep thought; he\nsaw his present in the garret, and foresaw his future in Coralie's\nrooms. Honorable resolution struggled with temptation and swayed him\nnow this way, now that. He sat down and began to look through his\nmanuscript, to see in what condition his friends had returned it to\nhim. What was his amazement, as he read chapter after chapter, to find\nhis poverty transmuted into riches by the cunning of the pen, and the\ndevotion of the unknown great men, his friends of the brotherhood.\nDialogue, closely packed, nervous, pregnant, terse, and full of the\nspirit of the age, replaced his conversations, which seemed poor and\npointless prattle in comparison. His characters, a little uncertain in\nthe drawing, now stood out in vigorous contrast of color and relief;\nphysiological observations, due no doubt to Horace Bianchon, supplied\nlinks of interpretations between human character and the curious\nphenomena of human life--subtle touches which made his men and women\nlive. His wordy passages of description were condensed and vivid. The\nmisshapen, ill-clad child of his brain had returned to him as a lovely\nmaiden, with white robes and rosy-hued girdle and scarf--an entrancing\ncreation. Night fell and took him by surprise, reading through rising\ntears, stricken to earth by such greatness of soul, feeling the worth\nof such a lesson, admiring the alterations, which taught him more of\nliterature and art than all his four years' apprenticeship of study\nand reading and comparison. A master's correction of a line made upon\nthe study always teaches more than all the theories and criticisms in\nthe world.\n\n\"What friends are these! What hearts! How fortunate I am!\" he cried,\ngrasping his manuscript tightly.\n\nWith the quick impulsiveness of a poetic and mobile temperament, he\nrushed off to Daniel's lodging. As he climbed the stairs, and thought\nof these friends, who refused to leave the path of honor, he felt\nconscious that he was less worthy of them than before. A voice spoke\nwithin him, telling him that if d'Arthez had loved Coralie, he would\nhave had her break with Camusot. And, besides this, he knew that the\nbrotherhood held journalism in utter abhorrence, and that he himself\nwas already, to some small extent, a journalist. All of them, except\nMeyraux, who had just gone out, were in d'Arthez's room when he\nentered it, and saw that all their faces were full of sorrow and\ndespair.\n\n\"What is it?\" he cried.\n\n\"We have just heard news of a dreadful catastrophe; the greatest\nthinker of the age, our most loved friend, who was like a light among\nus for two years----\"\n\n\"Louis Lambert!\"\n\n\"Has fallen a victim to catalepsy. There is no hope for him,\" said\nBianchon.\n\n\"He will die, his soul wandering in the skies, his body unconscious on\nearth,\" said Michel Chrestien solemnly.\n\n\"He will die as he lived,\" said d'Arthez.\n\n\"Love fell like a firebrand in the vast empire of his brain and burned\nhim away,\" said Leon Giraud.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Joseph Bridau, \"he has reached a height that we cannot so\nmuch as see.\"\n\n\"_We_ are to be pitied, not Louis,\" said Fulgence Ridal.\n\n\"Perhaps he will recover,\" exclaimed Lucien.\n\n\"From what Meyraux has been telling us, recovery seems impossible,\"\nanswered Bianchon. \"Medicine has no power over the change that is\nworking in his brain.\"\n\n\"Yet there are physical means,\" said d'Arthez.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Bianchon; \"we might produce imbecility instead of\ncatalepsy.\"\n\n\"Is there no way of offering another head to the spirit of evil? I\nwould give mine to save him!\" cried Michel Chrestien.\n\n\"And what would become of European federation?\" asked d'Arthez.\n\n\"Ah! true,\" replied Michel Chrestien. \"Our duty to Humanity comes\nfirst; to one man afterwards.\"\n\n\"I came here with a heart full of gratitude to you all,\" said Lucien.\n\"You have changed my alloy into golden coin.\"\n\n\"Gratitude! For what do you take us?\" asked Bianchon.\n\n\"We had the pleasure,\" added Fulgence.\n\n\"Well, so you are a journalist, are you?\" asked Leon Giraud. \"The fame\nof your first appearance has reached even the Latin Quarter.\"\n\n\"I am not a journalist yet,\" returned Lucien.\n\n\"Aha! So much the better,\" said Michel Chrestien.\n\n\"I told you so!\" said d'Arthez. \"Lucien knows the value of a clean\nconscience. When you can say to yourself as you lay your head on the\npillow at night, 'I have not sat in judgment on another man's work; I\nhave given pain to no one; I have not used the edge of my wit to deal\na stab to some harmless soul; I have sacrificed no one's success to a\njest; I have not even troubled the happiness of imbecility; I have not\nadded to the burdens of genius; I have scorned the easy triumphs of\nepigram; in short, I have not acted against my convictions,' is not\nthis a viaticum that gives one daily strength?\"\n\n\"But one can say all this, surely, and yet work on a newspaper,\" said\nLucien. \"If I had absolutely no other way of earning a living, I\nshould certainly come to this.\"\n\n\"Oh! oh! oh!\" cried Fulgence, his voice rising a note each time; \"we\nare capitulating, are we?\"\n\n\"He will turn journalist,\" Leon Giraud said gravely. \"Oh, Lucien, if\nyou would only stay and work with us! We are about to bring out a\nperiodical in which justice and truth shall never be violated; we will\nspread doctrines that, perhaps, will be of real service to\nmankind----\"\n\n\"You will not have a single subscriber,\" Lucien broke in with\nMachiavellian wisdom.\n\n\"There will be five hundred of them,\" asserted Michel Chrestien, \"but\nthey will be worth five hundred thousand.\"\n\n\"You will need a lot of capital,\" continued Lucien.\n\n\"No, only devotion,\" said d'Arthez.\n\n\"Anybody might take him for a perfumer's assistant,\" burst out Michel\nChrestien, looking at Lucien's head, and sniffing comically. \"You were\nseen driving about in a very smart turnout with a pair of\nthoroughbreds, and a mistress for a prince, Coralie herself.\"\n\n\"Well, and is there any harm in it?\"\n\n\"You would not say that if you thought that there was no harm in it,\"\nsaid Bianchon.\n\n\"I could have wished Lucien a Beatrice,\" said d'Arthez, \"a noble\nwoman, who would have been a help to him in life----\"\n\n\"But, Daniel,\" asked Lucien, \"love is love wherever you find it, is it\nnot?\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said the republican member, \"on that one point I am an\naristocrat. I could not bring myself to love a woman who must rub\nshoulders with all sorts of people in the green-room; whom an actor\nkisses on stage; she must lower herself before the public, smile on\nevery one, lift her skirts as she dances, and dress like a man, that\nall the world may see what none should see save I alone. Or if I loved\nsuch a woman, she should leave the stage, and my love should cleanse\nher from the stain of it.\"\n\n\"And if she would not leave the stage?\"\n\n\"I should die of mortification, jealousy, and all sorts of pain. You\ncannot pluck love out of your heart as you draw a tooth.\"\n\nLucien's face grew dark and thoughtful.\n\n\"When they find out that I am tolerating Camusot, how they will\ndespise me,\" he thought.\n\n\"Look here,\" said the fierce republican, with humorous fierceness,\n\"you can be a great writer, but a little play-actor you shall never\nbe,\" and he took up his hat and went out.\n\n\"He is hard, is Michel Chrestien,\" commented Lucien.\n\n\"Hard and salutary, like the dentist's pincers,\" said Bianchon.\n\"Michel foresees your future; perhaps in the street, at this moment,\nhe is thinking of you with tears in his eyes.\"\n\nD'Arthez was kind, and talked comfortingly, and tried to cheer Lucien.\nThe poet spent an hour with his friends, then he went, but his\nconscience treated him hardly, crying to him, \"You will be a\njournalist--a journalist!\" as the witch cried to Macbeth that he\nshould be king hereafter!\n\nOut in the street, he looked up at d'Arthez's windows, and saw a faint\nlight shining in them, and his heart sank. A dim foreboding told him\nthat he had bidden his friends good-bye for the last time.\n\nAs he turned out of the Place de la Sorbonne into the Rue de Cluny, he\nsaw a carriage at the door of his lodging. Coralie had driven all the\nway from the Boulevard du Temple for the sake of a moment with her\nlover and a \"good-night.\" Lucien found her sobbing in his garret. She\nwould be as wretchedly poor as her poet, she wept, as she arranged his\nshirts and gloves and handkerchiefs in the crazy chest of drawers. Her\ndistress was so real and so great, that Lucien, but even now chidden\nfor his connection with an actress, saw Coralie as a saint ready to\nassume the hair-shirt of poverty. The adorable girl's excuse for her\nvisit was an announcement that the firm of Camusot, Coralie, and\nLucien meant to invite Matifat, Florine, and Lousteau (the second\ntrio) to supper; had Lucien any invitations to issue to people who\nmight be useful to him? Lucien said that he would take counsel of\nLousteau.\n\nA few moments were spent together, and Coralie hurried away. She\nspared Lucien the knowledge that Camusot was waiting for her below.\n\nNext morning, at eight o'clock, Lucien went to Etienne Lousteau's\nroom, found it empty, and hurried away to Florine. Lousteau and\nFlorine, settled into possession of their new quarters like a married\ncouple, received their friend in the pretty bedroom, and all three\nbreakfasted sumptuously together.\n\n\"Why, I should advise you, my boy, to come with me to see Felicien\nVernou,\" said Lousteau, when they sat at table, and Lucien had\nmentioned Coralie's projected supper; \"ask him to be of the party, and\nkeep well with him, if you can keep well with such a rascal. Felicien\nVernou does a _feuilleton_ for a political paper; he might perhaps\nintroduce you, and you could blossom out into leaders in it at your\nease. It is a Liberal paper, like ours; you will be a Liberal, that is\nthe popular party; and besides, if you mean to go over to the\nMinisterialists, you would do better for yourself if they had reason\nto be afraid of you. Then there is Hector Merlin and his Mme. du\nVal-Noble; you meet great people at their house--dukes and dandies and\nmillionaires; didn't they ask you and Coralie to dine with them?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Lucien; \"you are going too, and so is Florine.\" Lucien\nand Etienne were now on familiar terms after Friday's debauch and the\ndinner at the _Rocher de Cancale_.\n\n\"Very well, Merlin is on the paper; we shall come across him pretty\noften; he is the chap to follow close on Finot's heels. You would do\nwell to pay him attention; ask him and Mme. du Val-Noble to supper. He\nmay be useful to you before long; for rancorous people are always in\nneed of others, and he may do you a good turn if he can reckon on your\npen.\"\n\n\"Your beginning has made enough sensation to smooth your way,\" said\nFlorine; \"take advantage of it at once, or you will soon be\nforgotten.\"\n\n\"The bargain, the great business, is concluded,\" Lousteau continued.\n\"That Finot, without a spark of talent in him, is to be editor of\nDauriat's weekly paper, with a salary of six hundred francs per month,\nand owner of a sixth share, for which he has not paid one penny. And\nI, my dear fellow, am now editor of our little paper. Everything went\noff as I expected; Florine managed superbly, she could give points to\nTallyrand himself.\"\n\n\"We have a hold on men through their pleasures,\" said Florine, \"while\na diplomatist only works on their self-love. A diplomatist sees a man\nmade up for the occasion; we know him in his moments of folly, so our\npower is greater.\"\n\n\"And when the thing was settled, Matifat made the first and last joke\nof his whole druggist's career,\" put in Lousteau. \"He said, 'This\naffair is quite in my line; I am supplying drugs to the public.'\"\n\n\"I suspect that Florine put him up to it,\" cried Lucien.\n\n\"And by these means, my little dear, your foot is in the stirrup,\"\ncontinued Lousteau.\n\n\"You were born with a silver spoon in your mouth,\" remarked Florine.\n\"What lots of young fellows wait for years, wait till they are sick of\nwaiting, for a chance to get an article into a paper! You will do like\nEmile Blondet. In six months' time you will be giving yourself high\nand mighty airs,\" she added, with a mocking smile, in the language of\nher class.\n\n\"Haven't I been in Paris for three years?\" said Lousteau, \"and only\nyesterday Finot began to pay me a fixed monthly salary of three\nhundred francs, and a hundred francs per sheet for his paper.\"\n\n\"Well; you are saying nothing!\" exclaimed Florine, with her eyes\nturned on Lucien.\n\n\"We shall see,\" said Lucien.\n\n\"My dear boy, if you had been my brother, I could not have done more\nfor you,\" retorted Lousteau, somewhat nettled, \"but I won't answer for\nFinot. Scores of sharp fellows will besiege Finot for the next two\ndays with offers to work for low pay. I have promised for you, but you\ncan draw back if you like.--You little know how lucky you are,\" he\nadded after a pause. \"All those in our set combine to attack an enemy\nin various papers, and lend each other a helping hand all round.\"\n\n\"Let us go in the first place to Felicien Vernou,\" said Lucien. He was\neager to conclude an alliance with such formidable birds of prey.\n\nLousteau sent for a cab, and the pair of friends drove to Vernou's\nhouse on the second floor up an alley in the Rue Mandar. To Lucien's\ngreat astonishment, the harsh, fastidious, and severe critic's\nsurroundings were vulgar to the last degree. A marbled paper, cheap\nand shabby, with a meaningless pattern repeated at regular intervals,\ncovered the walls, and a series of aqua tints in gilt frames decorated\nthe apartment, where Vernou sat at table with a woman so plain that\nshe could only be the legitimate mistress of the house, and two very\nsmall children perched on high chairs with a bar in front to prevent\nthe infants from tumbling out. Felicien Vernou, in a cotton\ndressing-gown contrived out of the remains of one of his wife's\ndresses, was not over well pleased by this invasion.\n\n\"Have you breakfasted, Lousteau?\" he asked, placing a chair for\nLucien.\n\n\"We have just left Florine; we have been breakfasting with her.\"\n\nLucien could not take his eyes off Mme. Vernou. She looked like a\nstout, homely cook, with a tolerably fair complexion, but commonplace\nto the last degree. The lady wore a bandana tied over her night-cap,\nthe strings of the latter article of dress being tied so tightly under\nthe chin that her puffy cheeks stood out on either side. A shapeless,\nbeltless garment, fastened by a single button at the throat, enveloped\nher from head to foot in such a fashion that a comparison to a\nmilestone at once suggested itself. Her health left no room for hope;\nher cheeks were almost purple; her fingers looked like sausages. In a\nmoment it dawned upon Lucien how it was that Vernou was always so ill\nat ease in society; here was the living explanation of his\nmisanthropy. Sick of his marriage, unable to bring himself to abandon\nhis wife and family, he had yet sufficient of the artistic temper to\nsuffer continually from their presence; Vernou was an actor by nature\nbound never to pardon the success of another, condemned to chronic\ndiscontent because he was never content with himself. Lucien began to\nunderstand the sour look which seemed to add to the bleak expression\nof envy on Vernou's face; the acerbity of the epigrams with which his\nconversation was sown, the journalist's pungent phrases, keen and\nelaborately wrought as a stiletto, were at once explained.\n\n\"Let us go into my study,\" Vernou said, rising from the table; \"you\nhave come on business, no doubt.\"\n\n\"Yes and no,\" replied Etienne Lousteau. \"It is a supper, old chap.\"\n\n\"I have brought a message from Coralie,\" said Lucien (Mme. Vernou\nlooked up at once at the name), \"to ask you to supper to-night at her\nhouse to meet the same company as before at Florine's, and a few more\nbesides--Hector Merlin and Mme. du Val-Noble and some others. There\nwill be play afterwards.\"\n\n\"But we are engaged to Mme. Mahoudeau this evening, dear,\" put in the\nwife.\n\n\"What does that matter?\" returned Vernou.\n\n\"She will take offence if we don't go; and you are very glad of her\nwhen you have a bill to discount.\"\n\n\"This wife of mine, my dear boy, can never be made to understand that\na supper engagement for twelve o'clock does not prevent you from going\nto an evening party that comes to an end at eleven. She is always with\nme while I work,\" he added.\n\n\"You have so much imagination!\" said Lucien, and thereby made a mortal\nenemy of Vernou.\n\n\"Well,\" continued Lousteau, \"you are coming; but that is not all. M.\nde Rubempre is about to be one of us, so you must push him in your\npaper. Give him out for a chap that will make a name for himself in\nliterature, so that he can put in at least a couple of articles every\nmonth.\"\n\n\"Yes, if he means to be one of us, and will attack our enemies, as we\nwill attack his, I will say a word for him at the Opera to-night,\"\nreplied Vernou.\n\n\"Very well--good-bye till to-morrow, my boy,\" said Lousteau, shaking\nhands with every sign of cordiality. \"When is your book coming out?\"\n\n\"That depends on Dauriat; it is ready,\" said Vernou _pater-familias_.\n\n\"Are you satisfied?\"\n\n\"Yes and no----\"\n\n\"We will get up a success,\" said Lousteau, and he rose with a bow to\nhis colleague's wife.\n\nThe abrupt departure was necessary indeed; for the two infants,\nengaged in a noisy quarrel, were fighting with their spoons, and\nflinging the pap in each other's faces.\n\n\"That, my boy, is a woman who all unconsciously will work great havoc\nin contemporary literature,\" said Etienne, when they came away. \"Poor\nVernou cannot forgive us for his wife. He ought to be relieved of her\nin the interests of the public; and a deluge of blood-thirsty reviews\nand stinging sarcasms against successful men of every sort would be\naverted. What is to become of a man with such a wife and that pair of\nabominable brats? Have you seen Rigaudin in Picard's _La Maison en\nLoterie_? You have? Well, like Rigaudin, Vernou will not fight himself,\nbut he will set others fighting; he would give an eye to put out both\neyes in the head of the best friend he has. You will see him using the\nbodies of the slain for a stepping-stone, rejoicing over every one's\nmisfortunes, attacking princes, dukes, marquises, and nobles, because\nhe himself is a commoner; reviling the work of unmarried men because\nhe forsooth has a wife; and everlastingly preaching morality, the joys\nof domestic life, and the duties of the citizen. In short, this very\nmoral critic will spare no one, not even infants of tender age. He\nlives in the Rue Mandar with a wife who might be the _Mamamouchi_ of the\n_Bourgeois gentilhomme_ and a couple of little Vernous as ugly as sin.\nHe tries to sneer at the Faubourg Saint-Germain, where he will never\nset foot, and makes his duchesses talk like his wife. That is the sort\nof man to raise a howl at the Jesuits, insult the Court, and credit\nthe Court party with the design of restoring feudal rights and the\nright of primogeniture--just the one to preach a crusade for Equality,\nhe that thinks himself the equal of no one. If he were a bachelor, he\nwould go into society; if he were in a fair way to be a Royalist poet\nwith a pension and the Cross of the Legion of Honor, he would be an\noptimist, and journalism offers starting-points by the hundred.\nJournalism is the giant catapult set in motion by pigmy hatreds. Have\nyou any wish to marry after this? Vernou has none of the milk of human\nkindness in him, it is all turned to gall; and he is emphatically the\nJournalist, a tiger with two hands that tears everything to pieces, as\nif his pen had the hydrophobia.\"\n\n\"It is a case of gunophobia,\" said Lucien. \"Has he ability?\"\n\n\"He is witty, he is a writer of articles. He incubates articles; he\ndoes that all his life and nothing else. The most dogged industry\nwould fail to graft a book on his prose. Felicien is incapable of\nconceiving a work on a large scale, of broad effects, of fitting\ncharacters harmoniously in a plot which develops till it reaches a\nclimax. He has ideas, but he has no knowledge of facts; his heroes are\nutopian creatures, philosophical or Liberal notions masquerading. He\nis at pains to write an original style, but his inflated periods would\ncollapse at a pin-prick from a critic; and therefore he goes in terror\nof reviews, like every one else who can only keep his head above water\nwith the bladders of newspaper puffs.\"\n\n\"What an article you are making out of him!\"\n\n\"That particular kind, my boy, must be spoken, and never written.\"\n\n\"You are turning editor,\" said Lucien.\n\n\"Where shall I put you down?\"\n\n\"At Coralie's.\"\n\n\"Ah! we are infatuated,\" said Lousteau. \"What a mistake! Do as I do\nwith Florine, let Coralie be your housekeeper, and take your fling.\"\n\n\"You would send a saint to perdition,\" laughed Lucien.\n\n\"Well, there is no damning a devil,\" retorted Lousteau.\n\nThe flippant tone, the brilliant talk of this new friend, his views of\nlife, his paradoxes, the axioms of Parisian Machiavelism,--all these\nthings impressed Lucien unawares. Theoretically the poet knew that\nsuch thoughts were perilous; but he believed them practically useful.\n\nArrived in the Boulevard du Temple, the friends agreed to meet at the\noffice between four and five o'clock. Hector Merlin would doubtless be\nthere. Lousteau was right. The infatuation of desire was upon Lucien;\nfor the courtesan who loves knows how to grapple her lover to her by\nevery weakness in his nature, fashioning herself with incredible\nflexibility to his every wish, encouraging the soft, effeminate habits\nwhich strengthen her hold. Lucien was thirsting already for enjoyment;\nhe was in love with the easy, luxurious, and expensive life which the\nactress led.\n\nHe found Coralie and Camusot intoxicated with joy. The Gymnase offered\nCoralie an engagement after Easter on terms for which she had never\ndared to hope.\n\n\"And this great success is owing to you,\" said Camusot.\n\n\"Yes, surely. _The Alcalde_ would have fallen flat but for him,\" cried\nCoralie; \"if there had been no article, I should have been in for\nanother six years of the Boulevard theatres.\"\n\nShe danced up to Lucien and flung her arms round him, putting an\nindescribable silken softness and sweetness into her enthusiasm. Love\nhad come to Coralie. And Camusot? his eyes fell. Looking down after\nthe wont of mankind in moments of sharp pain, he saw the seam of\nLucien's boots, a deep yellow thread used by the best bootmakers of\nthat time, in strong contrast with the glistening leather. The color\nof that seam had tinged his thoughts during a previous conversation\nwith himself, as he sought to explain the presence of a mysterious\npair of hessians in Coralie's fender. He remembered now that he had\nseen the name of \"Gay, Rue de la Michodiere,\" printed in black letters\non the soft white kid lining.\n\n\"You have a handsome pair of boots, sir,\" he said.\n\n\"Like everything else about him,\" said Coralie.\n\n\"I should be very glad of your bootmaker's address.\"\n\n\"Oh, how like the Rue des Bourdonnais to ask for a tradesman's\naddress,\" cried Coralie. \"Do _you_ intend to patronize a young man's\nbootmaker? A nice young man you would make! Do keep to your own\ntop-boots; they are the kind for a steady-going man with a wife and\nfamily and a mistress.\"\n\n\"Indeed, if you would take off one of your boots, sir, I should be\nvery much obliged,\" persisted Camusot.\n\n\"I could not get it on again without a button-hook,\" said Lucien,\nflushing up.\n\n\"Berenice will fetch you one; we can do with some here,\" jeered\nCamusot.\n\n\"Papa Camusot!\" said Coralie, looking at him with cruel scorn, \"have\nthe courage of your pitiful baseness. Come, speak out! You think that\nthis gentleman's boots are very like mine, do you not?--I forbid you\nto take off your boots,\" she added, turning to Lucien.--\"Yes, M.\nCamusot. Yes, you saw some boots lying about in the fender here the\nother day, and that is the identical pair, and this gentleman was\nhiding in my dressing-room at the time, waiting for them; and he had\npassed the night here. That was what you were thinking, _hein_? Think\nso; I would rather you did. It is the simple truth. I am deceiving\nyou. And if I am? I do it to please myself.\"\n\nShe sat down. There was no anger in her face, no embarrassment; she\nlooked from Camusot to Lucien. The two men avoided each other's eyes.\n\n\"I will believe nothing that you do not wish me to believe,\" said\nCamusot. \"Don't play with me, Coralie; I was wrong----\"\n\n\"I am either a shameless baggage that has taken a sudden fancy; or a\npoor, unhappy girl who feels what love really is for the first time,\nthe love that all women long for. And whichever way it is, you must\nleave me or take me as I am,\" she said, with a queenly gesture that\ncrushed Camusot.\n\n\"Is it really true?\" he asked, seeing from their faces that this was\nno jest, yet begging to be deceived.\n\n\"I love mademoiselle,\" Lucien faltered out.\n\nAt that word, Coralie sprang to her poet and held him tightly to her;\nthen, with her arms still about him, she turned to the silk-mercer, as\nif to bid him see the beautiful picture made by two young lovers.\n\n\"Poor Musot, take all that you gave to me back again; I do not want to\nkeep anything of yours; for I love this boy here madly, not for his\nintellect, but for his beauty. I would rather starve with him than\nhave millions with you.\"\n\nCamusot sank into a low chair, hid his face in his hands, and said not\na word.\n\n\"Would you like us to go away?\" she asked. There was a note of\nferocity in her voice which no words can describe.\n\nCold chills ran down Lucien's spine; he beheld himself burdened with a\nwoman, an actress, and a household.\n\n\"Stay here, Coralie; keep it all,\" the old tradesman said at last, in\na faint, unsteady voice that came from his heart; \"I don't want\nanything back. There is the worth of sixty thousand francs here in the\nfurniture; but I could not bear to think of my Coralie in want. And\nyet, it will not be long before you come to want. However great this\ngentleman's talent may be, he can't afford to keep you. We old fellows\nmust expect this sort of thing. Coralie, let me come and see you\nsometimes; I may be of use to you. And--I confess it; I cannot live\nwithout you.\"\n\nThe poor man's gentleness, stripped as he was of his happiness just as\nhappiness had reached its height, touched Lucien deeply. Coralie was\nquite unsoftened by it.\n\n\"Come as often as you wish, poor Musot,\" she said; \"I shall like you\nall the better when I don't pretend to love you.\"\n\nCamusot seemed to be resigned to his fate so long as he was not driven\nout of the earthly paradise, in which his life could not have been all\njoy; he trusted to the chances of life in Paris and to the temptations\nthat would beset Lucien's path; he would wait a while, and all that\nhad been his should be his again. Sooner or later, thought the wily\ntradesman, this handsome young fellow would be unfaithful; he would\nkeep a watch on him; and the better to do this and use his opportunity\nwith Coralie, he would be their friend. The persistent passion that\ncould consent to such humiliation terrified Lucien. Camusot's proposal\nof a dinner at Very's in the Palais Royal was accepted.\n\n\"What joy!\" cried Coralie, as soon as Camusot had departed. \"You will\nnot go back now to your garret in the Latin Quarter; you will live\nhere. We shall always be together. You can take a room in the Rue\nCharlot for the sake of appearances, and _vogue le galere_!\"\n\nShe began to dance her Spanish dance, with an excited eagerness that\nrevealed the strength of the passion in her heart.\n\n\"If I work hard I may make five hundred francs a month,\" Lucien said.\n\n\"And I shall make as much again at the theatre, without counting\nextras. Camusot will pay for my dresses as before. He is fond of me!\nWe can live like Croesus on fifteen hundred francs a month.\"\n\n\"And the horses? and the coachman? and the footman?\" inquired\nBerenice.\n\n\"I will get into debt,\" said Coralie. And she began to dance with\nLucien.\n\n\"I must close with Finot after this,\" Lucien exclaimed.\n\n\"There!\" said Coralie, \"I will dress and take you to your office. I\nwill wait outside in the boulevard for you with the carriage.\"\n\nLucien sat down on the sofa and made some very sober reflections as he\nwatched Coralie at her toilet. It would have been wiser to leave\nCoralie free than to start all at once with such an establishment; but\nCoralie was there before his eyes, and Coralie was so lovely, so\ngraceful, so bewitching, that the more picturesque aspects of bohemia\nwere in evidence; and he flung down the gauntlet to fortune.\n\nBerenice was ordered to superintend Lucien's removal and installation;\nand Coralie, triumphant, radiant, and happy, carried off her love, her\npoet, and must needs go all over Paris on the way to the Rue\nSaint-Fiacre. Lucien sprang lightly up the staircase, and entered the\noffice with an air of being quite at home. Coloquinte was there with\nthe stamped paper still on his head; and old Giroudeau told him again,\nhypocritically enough, that no one had yet come in.\n\n\"But the editor and contributors _must_ meet somewhere or other to\narrange about the journal,\" said Lucien.\n\n\"Very likely; but I have nothing to do with the writing of the paper,\"\nsaid the Emperor's captain, resuming his occupation of checking off\nwrappers with his eternal broum! broum!\n\nWas it lucky or unlucky? Finot chanced to come in at that very moment\nto announce his sham abdication and to bid Giroudeau watch over his\ninterests.\n\n\"No shilly-shally with this gentleman; he is on the staff,\" Finot\nadded for his uncle's benefit, as he grasped Lucien by the hand.\n\n\"Oh! is he on the paper?\" exclaimed Giroudeau, much surprised at this\nfriendliness. \"Well, sir, you came on without much difficulty.\"\n\n\"I want to make things snug for you here, lest Etienne should\nbamboozle you,\" continued Finot, looking knowingly at Lucien. \"This\ngentleman will be paid three francs per column all round, including\ntheatres.\"\n\n\"You have never taken any one on such terms before,\" said Giroudeau,\nopening his eyes.\n\n\"And he will take the four Boulevard theatres. See that nobody sneaks\nhis boxes, and that he gets his share of tickets.--I should advise\nyou, nevertheless, to have them sent to your address,\" he added,\nturning to Lucien.--\"And he agrees to write besides ten miscellaneous\narticles of two columns each, for fifty francs per month, for one\nyear. Does that suit you?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Lucien. Circumstances had forced his hand.\n\n\"Draw up the agreement, uncle, and we will sign it when we come\ndownstairs.\"\n\n\"Who is the gentleman?\" inquired Giroudeau, rising and taking off his\nblack silk skull-cap.\n\n\"M. Lucien de Rubempre, who wrote the article on _The Alcalde_.\"\n\n\"Young man, you have a gold mine _there_,\" said the old soldier, tapping\nLucien on the forehead. \"I am not literary myself, but I read that\narticle of yours, and I liked it. That is the kind of thing! There's\ngaiety for you! 'That will bring us new subscribers,' says I to\nmyself. And so it did. We sold fifty more numbers.\"\n\n\"Is my agreement with Lousteau made out in duplicate and ready to\nsign?\" asked Finot, speaking aside.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then ante-date this gentleman's agreement by one day, so that\nLousteau will be bound by the previous contract.\"\n\nFinot took his new contributor's arm with a friendliness that charmed\nLucien, and drew him out on the landing to say:--\n\n\"Your position is made for you. I will introduce you to _my_ staff\nmyself, and to-night Lousteau will go round with you to the theatres.\nYou can make a hundred and fifty francs per month on this little paper\nof ours with Lousteau as its editor, so try to keep well with him. The\nrogue bears a grudge against me as it is, for tying his hands so far\nas you are concerned; but you have ability, and I don't choose that\nyou shall be subjected to the whims of the editor. You might let me\nhave a couple of sheets every month for my review, and I will pay you\ntwo hundred francs. This is between ourselves, don't mention it to\nanybody else; I should be laid open to the spite of every one whose\nvanity is mortified by your good fortune. Write four articles, fill\nyour two sheets, sign two with your own name, and two with a\npseudonym, so that you may not seem to be taking the bread out of\nanybody else's mouth. You owe your position to Blondet and Vignon;\nthey think that you have a future before you. So keep out of scrapes,\nand, above all things, be on your guard against your friends. As for\nme, we shall always get on well together, you and I. Help me, and I\nwill help you. You have forty francs' worth of boxes and tickets to\nsell, and sixty francs' worth of books to convert into cash. With that\nand your work on the paper, you will be making four hundred and fifty\nfrancs every month. If you use your wits, you will find ways of making\nanother two hundred francs at least among the publishers; they will\npay you for reviews and prospectuses. But you are mine, are you not? I\ncan count upon you.\"\n\nLucien squeezed Finot's hand in transports of joy which no words can\nexpress.\n\n\"Don't let any one see that anything has passed between us,\" said\nFinot in his ear, and he flung open a door of a room in the roof at\nthe end of a long passage on the fifth floor.\n\nA table covered with a green cloth was drawn up to a blazing fire, and\nseated in various chairs and lounges Lucien discovered Lousteau,\nFelicien Vernou, Hector Merlin, and two others unknown to him, all\nlaughing or smoking. A real inkstand, full of ink this time, stood on\nthe table among a great litter of papers; while a collection of pens,\nthe worse for wear, but still serviceable for journalists, told the\nnew contributor very plainly that the mighty enterprise was carried on\nin this apartment.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" said Finot, \"the object of this gathering is the\ninstallation of our friend Lousteau in my place as editor of the\nnewspaper which I am compelled to relinquish. But although my opinions\nwill necessarily undergo a transformation when I accept the editorship\nof a review of which the politics are known to you, my _convictions_\nremain the same, and we shall be friends as before. I am quite at your\nservice, and you likewise will be ready to do anything for me.\nCircumstances change; principles are fixed. Principles are the pivot\non which the hands of the political barometer turn.\"\n\nThere was an instant shout of laughter.\n\n\"Who put that into your mouth?\" asked Lousteau.\n\n\"Blondet!\" said Finot.\n\n\"Windy, showery, stormy, settled fair,\" said Merlin; \"we will all row\nin the same boat.\"\n\n\"In short,\" continued Finot, \"not to muddle our wits with metaphors,\nany one who has an article or two for me will always find Finot.--This\ngentleman,\" turning to Lucien, \"will be one of you.--I have arranged\nwith him, Lousteau.\"\n\nEvery one congratulated Finot on his advance and new prospects.\n\n\"So there you are, mounted on our shoulders,\" said a contributor\nwhom Lucien did not know. \"You will be the Janus of Journal----\"\n\n\"So long as he isn't the Janot,\" put in Vernou.\n\n\"Are you going to allow us to make attacks on our _betes noires_?\"\n\n\"Any one you like.\"\n\n\"Ah, yes!\" said Lousteau; \"but the paper must keep on its lines. M.\nChatelet is very wroth; we shall not let him off for a week yet.\"\n\n\"What has happened?\" asked Lucien.\n\n\"He came here to ask for an explanation,\" said Vernou. \"The Imperial\nbuck found old Giroudeau at home; and old Giroudeau told him, with all\nthe coolness in the world, that Philippe Bridau wrote the article.\nPhilippe asked the Baron to mention the time and the weapons, and\nthere it ended. We are engaged at this moment in offering excuses to\nthe Baron in to-morrow's issue. Every phrase is a stab for him.\"\n\n\"Keep your teeth in him and he will come round to me,\" said Finot;\n\"and it will look as if I were obliging him by appeasing you. He can\nsay a word to the Ministry, and we can get something or other out of\nhim--an assistant schoolmaster's place, or a tobacconist's license. It\nis a lucky thing for us that we flicked him on the raw. Does anybody\nhere care to take a serious article on Nathan for my new paper?\"\n\n\"Give it to Lucien,\" said Lousteau. \"Hector and Vernou will write\narticles in their papers at the same time.\"\n\n\"Good-day, gentlemen; we shall meet each other face to face at\nBarbin's,\" said Finot, laughing.\n\nLucien received some congratulations on his admission to the mighty\narmy of journalists, and Lousteau explained that they could be sure of\nhim. \"Lucien wants you all to sup in a body at the house of the fair\nCoralie.\"\n\n\"Coralie is going on at the Gymnase,\" said Lucien.\n\n\"Very well, gentlemen; it is understood that we push Coralie, eh? Put\na few lines about her new engagement in your papers, and say something\nabout her talent. Credit the management of the Gymnase with tack and\ndiscernment; will it do to say intelligence?\"\n\n\"Yes, say intelligence,\" said Merlin; \"Frederic has something of\nScribe's.\"\n\n\"Oh! Well, then, the manager of the Gymnase is the most perspicacious\nand far-sighted of men of business,\" said Vernou.\n\n\"Look here! don't write your articles on Nathan until we have come to\nan understanding; you shall hear why,\" said Etienne Lousteau. \"We\nought to do something for our new comrade. Lucien here has two books\nto bring out--a volume of sonnets and a novel. The power of the\nparagraph should make him a great poet due in three months; and we\nwill make use of his sonnets (_Marguerites_ is the title) to run down\nodes, ballads, and reveries, and all the Romantic poetry.\"\n\n\"It would be a droll thing if the sonnets were no good after all,\"\nsaid Vernou.--\"What do you yourself think of your sonnets, Lucien?\"\n\n\"Yes, what do you think of them?\" asked one of the two whom Lucien did\nnot know.\n\n\"They are all right, gentlemen; I give you my word,\" said Lousteau.\n\n\"Very well, that will do for me,\" said Vernou; \"I will heave your book\nat the poets of the sacristy; I am tired of them.\"\n\n\"If Dauriat declines to take the _Marguerites_ this evening, we will\nattack him by pitching into Nathan.\"\n\n\"But what will Nathan say?\" cried Lucien.\n\nHis five colleagues burst out laughing.\n\n\"Oh! he will be delighted,\" said Vernou. \"You will see how we manage\nthese things.\"\n\n\"So he is one of us?\" said one of the two journalists.\n\n\"Yes, yes, Frederic; no tricks.--We are all working for you, Lucien,\nyou see; you must stand by us when your turn comes. We are all friends\nof Nathan's, and we are attacking him. Now, let us divide Alexander's\nempire.--Frederic, will you take the Francais and the Odeon?\"\n\n\"If these gentlemen are willing,\" returned the person addressed as\nFrederic. The others nodded assent, but Lucien saw a gleam of jealousy\nhere and there.\n\n\"I am keeping the Opera, the Italiens, and the Opera-Comique,\" put in\nVernou.\n\n\"And how about me? Am I to have no theatres at all?\" asked the second\nstranger.\n\n\"Oh well, Hector can let you have the Varietes, and Lucien can spare\nyou the Porte Saint-Martin.--Let him have the Porte Saint-Martin,\nLucien, he is wild about Fanny Beaupre; and you can take the\nCirque-Olympique in exchange. I shall have Bobino and the Funambules\nand Madame Saqui. Now, what have we for to-morrow?\"\n\n\"Nothing.\"\n\n\"Nothing?\"\n\n\"Nothing.\"\n\n\"Gentlemen, be brilliant for my first number. The Baron du Chatelet\nand his cuttlefish bone will not last for a week, and the writer of _Le\nSolitaire_ is worn out.\"\n\n\"And 'Sosthenes-Demosthenes' is stale too,\" said Vernou; \"everybody\nhas taken it up.\"\n\n\"The fact is, we want a new set of ninepins,\" said Frederic.\n\n\"Suppose that we take the virtuous representatives of the Right?\"\nsuggested Lousteau. \"We might say that M. de Bonald has sweaty feet.\"\n\n\"Let us begin a series of sketches of Ministerialist orators,\"\nsuggested Hector Merlin.\n\n\"You do that, youngster; you know them; they are your own party,\" said\nLousteau; \"you could indulge any little private grudges of your own.\nPitch into Beugnot and Syrieys de Mayrinhac and the rest. You might\nhave the sketches ready in advance, and we shall have something to\nfall back upon.\"\n\n\"How if we invented one or two cases of refusal of burial with\naggravating circumstances?\" asked Hector.\n\n\"Do not follow in the tracks of the big Constitutional papers; they\nhave pigeon-holes full of ecclesiastical _canards_,\" retorted Vernou.\n\n\"_Canards_?\" repeated Lucien.\n\n\"That is our word for a scrap of fiction told for true, put in to\nenliven the column of morning news when it is flat. We owe the\ndiscovery to Benjamin Franklin, the inventor of the lightning\nconductor and the republic. That journalist completely deceived the\nEncyclopaedists by his transatlantic _canards_. Raynal gives two of them\nfor facts in his _Histoire philosophique des Indes_.\"\n\n\"I did not know that,\" said Vernou. \"What were the stories?\"\n\n\"One was a tale about an Englishman and a negress who helped him to\nescape; he sold the woman for a slave after getting her with child\nhimself to enhance her value. The other was the eloquent defence of a\nyoung woman brought before the authorities for bearing a child out of\nwedlock. Franklin owned to the fraud in Necker's house when he came to\nParis, much to the confusion of French philosophism. Behold how the\nNew World twice set a bad example to the Old!\"\n\n\"In journalism,\" said Lousteau, \"everything that is probable is true.\nThat is an axiom.\"\n\n\"Criminal procedure is based on the same rule,\" said Vernou.\n\n\"Very well, we meet here at nine o'clock,\" and with that they rose,\nand the sitting broke up with the most affecting demonstrations of\nintimacy and good-will.\n\n\"What have you done to Finot, Lucien, that he should make a special\narrangement with you? You are the only one that he has bound to\nhimself,\" said Etienne Lousteau, as they came downstairs.\n\n\"I? Nothing. It was his own proposal,\" said Lucien.\n\n\"As a matter of fact, if you should make your own terms with him, I\nshould be delighted; we should, both of us, be the better for it.\"\n\nOn the ground floor they found Finot. He stepped across to Lousteau\nand asked him into the so-called private office. Giroudeau immediately\nput a couple of stamped agreements before Lucien.\n\n\"Sign your agreement,\" he said, \"and the new editor will think the\nwhole thing was arranged yesterday.\"\n\nLucien, reading the document, overheard fragments of a tolerably warm\ndispute within as to the line of conduct and profits of the paper.\nEtienne Lousteau wanted his share of the blackmail levied by\nGiroudeau; and, in all probability, the matter was compromised, for\nthe pair came out perfectly good friends.\n\n\"We will meet at Dauriat's, Lucien, in the Wooden Galleries at eight\no'clock,\" said Etienne Lousteau.\n\nA young man appeared, meanwhile, in search of employment, wearing the\nsame nervous shy look with which Lucien himself had come to the office\nso short a while ago; and in his secret soul Lucien felt amused as he\nwatched Giroudeau playing off the same tactics with which the old\ncampaigner had previously foiled him. Self-interest opened his eyes to\nthe necessity of the manoeuvres which raised well-nigh insurmountable\nbarriers between beginners and the upper room where the elect were\ngathered together.\n\n\"Contributors don't get very much as it is,\" he said, addressing\nGiroudeau.\n\n\"If there were more of you, there would be so much less,\" retorted the\ncaptain. \"So there!\"\n\nThe old campaigner swung his loaded cane, and went down coughing as\nusual. Out in the street he was amazed to see a handsome carriage\nwaiting on the boulevard for Lucien.\n\n\"_You_ are the army nowadays,\" he said, \"and we are the civilians.\"\n\n\"Upon my word,\" said Lucien, as he drove away with Coralie, \"these\nyoung writers seem to me to be the best fellows alive. Here am I a\njournalist, sure of making six hundred francs a month if I work like a\nhorse. But I shall find a publisher for my two books, and I will write\nothers; for my friends will insure a success. And so, Coralie, '_vogue\nle galere_!' as you say.\"\n\n\"You will make your way, dear boy; but you must not be as good-natured\nas you are good-looking; it would be the ruin of you. Be ill-natured,\nthat is the proper thing.\"\n\nCoralie and Lucien drove in the Bois de Boulogne, and again they met\nthe Marquise d'Espard, Mme. de Bargeton and the Baron du Chatelet.\nMme. de Bargeton gave Lucien a languishing glance which might be taken\nas a greeting. Camusot had ordered the best possible dinner; and\nCoralie, feeling that she was rid of her adorer, was more charming to\nthe poor silk-mercer than she had ever been in the fourteen months\nduring which their connection lasted; he had never seen her so kindly,\nso enchantingly lovely.\n\n\"Come,\" he thought, \"let us keep near her anyhow!\"\n\nIn consequence, Camusot made secret overtures. He promised Coralie an\nincome of six thousand livres; he would transfer the stock in the\nfunds into her name (his wife knew nothing about the investment) if\nonly she would consent to be his mistress still. He would shut his\neyes to her lover.\n\n\"And betray such an angel? . . . Why, just look at him, you old\nfossil, and look at yourself!\" and her eyes turned to her poet.\nCamusot had pressed Lucien to drink till the poet's head was rather\ncloudy.\n\nThere was no help for it; Camusot made up his mind to wait till sheer\nwant should give him this woman a second time.\n\n\"Then I can only be your friend,\" he said, as he kissed her on the\nforehead.\n\nLucien went from Coralie and Camusot to the Wooden Galleries. What a\nchange had been wrought in his mind by his initiation into Journalism!\nHe mixed fearlessly now with the crowd which surged to and fro in the\nbuildings; he even swaggered a little because he had a mistress; and\nhe walked into Dauriat's shop in an offhand manner because he was a\njournalist.\n\nHe found himself among distinguished men; gave a hand to Blondet and\nNathan and Finot, and to all the coterie with whom he had been\nfraternizing for a week. He was a personage, he thought, and he\nflattered himself that he surpassed his comrades. That little flick of\nthe wine did him admirable service; he was witty, he showed that he\ncould \"howl with the wolves.\"\n\nAnd yet, the tacit approval, the praises spoken and unspoken on which\nhe had counted, were not forthcoming. He noticed the first stirrings\nof jealousy among a group, less curious, perhaps, than anxious to know\nthe place which this newcomer might take, and the exact portion of the\nsum-total of profits which he would probably secure and swallow.\nLucien only saw smiles on two faces--Finot, who regarded him as a mine\nto be exploited, and Lousteau, who considered that he had proprietary\nrights in the poet, looked glad to see him. Lousteau had begun already\nto assume the airs of an editor; he tapped sharply on the window-panes\nof Dauriat's private office.\n\n\"One moment, my friend,\" cried a voice within as the publisher's face\nappeared above the green curtains.\n\nThe moment lasted an hour, and finally Lucien and Etienne were\nadmitted into the sanctum.\n\n\"Well, have you thought over our friend's proposal?\" asked Etienne\nLousteau, now an editor.\n\n\"To be sure,\" said Dauriat, lolling like a sultan in his chair. \"I\nhave read the volume. And I submitted it to a man of taste, a good\njudge; for I don't pretend to understand these things myself. I\nmyself, my friend, buy reputations ready-made, as the Englishman\nbought his love affairs.--You are as great as a poet as you are\nhandsome as a man, my boy,\" pronounced Dauriat. \"Upon my word and\nhonor (I don't tell you that as a publisher, mind), your sonnets are\nmagnificent; no sign of effort about them, as is natural when a man\nwrites with inspiration and verve. You know your craft, in fact, one\nof the good points of the new school. Your volume of _Marguerites_ is a\nfine book, but there is no business in it, and it is not worth my\nwhile to meddle with anything but a very big affair. In conscience, I\nwon't take your sonnets. It would be impossible to push them; there is\nnot enough in the thing to pay the expenses of a big success. You will\nnot keep to poetry besides; this book of yours will be your first and\nlast attempt of the kind. You are young; you bring me the everlasting\nvolume of early verse which every man of letters writes when he leaves\nschool, he thinks a lot of it at the time, and laughs at it later on.\nLousteau, your friend, has a poem put away somewhere among his old\nsocks, I'll warrant. Haven't you a poem that you thought a good deal\nof once, Lousteau?\" inquired Dauriat, with a knowing glance at the\nother.\n\n\"How should I be writing prose otherwise, eh?\" asked Lousteau.\n\n\"There, you see! He has never said a word to me about it, for our\nfriend understands business and the trade,\" continued Dauriat. \"For me\nthe question is not whether you are a great poet, I know that,\" he\nadded, stroking down Lucien's pride; \"you have a great deal, a very\ngreat deal of merit; if I were only just starting in business, I\nshould make the mistake of publishing your book. But in the first\nplace, my sleeping partners and those at the back of me are cutting\noff my supplies; I dropped twenty thousand francs over poetry last\nyear, and that is enough for them; they will not hear of any more just\nnow, and they are my masters. Nevertheless, that is not the question.\nI admit that you may be a great poet, but will you be a prolific\nwriter? Will you hatch sonnets regularly? Will you run into ten\nvolumes? Is there business in it? Of course not. You will be a\ndelightful prose writer; you have too much sense to spoil your style\nwith tagging rhymes together. You have a chance to make thirty\nthousand francs per annum by writing for the papers, and you will not\nexchange that chance for three thousand francs made with difficulty by\nyour hemistiches and strophes and tomfoolery----\"\n\n\"You know that he is on the paper, Dauriat?\" put in Lousteau.\n\n\"Yes,\" Dauriat answered. \"Yes, I saw his article, and in his own\ninterests I decline the _Marguerites_. Yes, sir, in six months' time I\nshall have paid you more money for the articles that I shall ask you\nto write than for your poetry that will not sell.\"\n\n\"And fame?\" said Lucien.\n\nDauriat and Lousteau laughed.\n\n\"Oh dear!\" said Lousteau, \"there be illusions left.\"\n\n\"Fame means ten years of sticking to work, and a hundred thousand\nfrancs lost or made in the publishing trade. If you find anybody mad\nenough to print your poetry for you, you will feel some respect for me\nin another twelvemonth, when you have had time to see the outcome of\nthe transaction\"\n\n\"Have you the manuscript here?\" Lucien asked coldly.\n\n\"Here it is, my friend,\" said Dauriat. The publisher's manner towards\nLucien had sweetened singularly.\n\nLucien took up the roll without looking at the string, so sure he felt\nthat Dauriat had read his _Marguerites_. He went out with Lousteau,\nseemingly neither disconcerted nor dissatisfied. Dauriat went with\nthem into the shop, talking of his newspaper and Lousteau's daily,\nwhile Lucien played with the manuscript of the _Marguerites_.\n\n\"Do you suppose that Dauriat has read your sonnets or sent them to any\none else?\" Etienne Lousteau snatched an opportunity to whisper.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Lucien.\n\n\"Look at the string.\" Lucien looked down at the blot of ink, and saw\nthat the mark on the string still coincided; he turned white with\nrage.\n\n\"Which of the sonnets was it that you particularly liked?\" he asked,\nturning to the publisher.\n\n\"They are all of them remarkable, my friend; but the sonnet on the\n_Marguerite_ is delightful, the closing thought is fine, and exquisitely\nexpressed. I felt sure from that sonnet that your prose work would\ncommand a success, and I spoke to Finot about you at once. Write\narticles for us, and we will pay you well for them. Fame is a very\nfine thing, you see, but don't forget the practical and solid, and\ntake every chance that turns up. When you have made money, you can\nwrite poetry.\"\n\nThe poet dashed out of the shop to avoid an explosion. He was furious.\nLousteau followed.\n\n\"Well, my boy, pray keep cool. Take men as they are--for means to an\nend. Do you wish for revenge?\"\n\n\"At any price,\" muttered the poet.\n\n\"Here is a copy of Nathan's book. Dauriat has just given it to me. The\nsecond edition is coming out to-morrow; read the book again, and knock\noff an article demolishing it. Felicien Vernou cannot endure Nathan,\nfor he thinks that Nathan's success will injure his own forthcoming\nbook. It is a craze with these little minds to fancy that there is not\nroom for two successes under the sun; so he will see that your article\nfinds a place in the big paper for which he writes.\"\n\n\"But what is there to be said against the book; it is good work!\"\ncried Lucien.\n\n\"Oh, I say! you must learn your trade,\" said Lousteau, laughing.\n\"Given that the book was a masterpiece, under the stroke of your pen\nit must turn to dull trash, dangerous and unwholesome stuff.\"\n\n\"But how?\"\n\n\"You turn all the good points into bad ones.\"\n\n\"I am incapable of such a juggler's feat.\"\n\n\"My dear boy, a journalist is a juggler; a man must make up his mind\nto the drawbacks of the calling. Look here! I am not a bad fellow;\nthis is the way _I_ should set to work myself. Attention! You might\nbegin by praising the book, and amuse yourself a while by saying what\nyou really think. 'Good,' says the reader, 'this critic is not\njealous; he will be impartial, no doubt,' and from that point your\npublic will think that your criticism is a piece of conscientious\nwork. Then, when you have won your reader's confidence, you will\nregret that you must blame the tendency and influence of such work\nupon French literature. 'Does not France,' you will say, 'sway the\nwhole intellectual world? French writers have kept Europe in the path\nof analysis and philosophical criticism from age to age by their\npowerful style and the original turn given by them to ideas.' Here,\nfor the benefit of the philistine, insert a panegyric on Voltaire,\nRousseau, Diderot, Montesquieu, and Buffon. Hold forth upon the\ninexorable French language; show how it spreads a varnish, as it were,\nover thought. Let fall a few aphorisms, such as--'A great writer in\nFrance is invariably a great man; he writes in a language which\ncompels him to think; it is otherwise in other countries'--and so on,\nand so on. Then, to prove your case, draw a comparison between\nRabener, the German satirical moralist, and La Bruyere. Nothing gives\na critic such an air as an apparent familiarity with foreign\nliterature. Kant is Cousin's pedestal.\n\n\"Once on that ground you bring out a word which sums up the French men\nof genius of the eighteenth century for the benefit of simpletons--you\ncall that literature the 'literature of ideas.' Armed with this\nexpression, you fling all the mighty dead at the heads of the\nillustrious living. You explain that in the present day a new form of\nliterature has sprung up; that dialogue (the easiest form of writing)\nis overdone, and description dispenses with any need for thinking on\nthe part of the author or reader. You bring up the fiction of\nVoltaire, Diderot, Sterne, and Le Sage, so trenchant, so compact of\nthe stuff of life; and turn from them to the modern novel, composed of\nscenery and word-pictures and metaphor and the dramatic situations, of\nwhich Scott is full. Invention may be displayed in such work, but\nthere is no room for anything else. 'The romance after the manner of\nScott is a mere passing fashion in literature,' you will say, and\nfulminate against the fatal way in which ideas are diluted and beaten\nthin; cry out against a style within the reach of any intellect, for\nany one can commence author at small expense in a way of literature,\nwhich you can nickname the 'literature of imagery.'\n\n\"Then you fall upon Nathan with your argument, and establish it\nbeyound cavil that he is a mere imitator with an appearance of genius.\nThe concise grand style of the eighteenth century is lacking; you show\nthat the author substitutes events for sentiments. Action and stir is\nnot life; he gives you pictures, but no ideas.\n\n\"Come out with such phrases, and people will take them up.--In spite\nof the merits of the work, it seems to you to be a dangerous, nay, a\nfatal precedent. It throws open the gates of the temple of Fame to the\ncrowd; and in the distance you descry a legion of petty authors\nhastening to imitate this novel and easy style of writing.\n\n\"Here you launch out into resounding lamentations over the decadence\nand decline of taste, and slip in eulogies of Messieurs Etienne Jouy,\nTissot, Gosse, Duval, Jay, Benjamin Constant, Aignan, Baour-Lormian,\nVillemain, and the whole Liberal-Bonapartist chorus who patronize\nVernou's paper. Next you draw a picture of that glorious phalanx of\nwriters repelling the invasion of the Romantics; these are the\nupholders of ideas and style as against metaphor and balderdash; the\nmodern representatives of the school of Voltaire as opposed to the\nEnglish and German schools, even as the seventeen heroic deputies of\nthe Left fought the battle for the nation against the Ultras of the\nRight.\n\n\"And then, under cover of names respected by the immense majority of\nFrenchmen (who will always be against the Government), you can crush\nNathan; for although his work is far above the average, it confirms\nthe bourgeois taste for literature without ideas. And after that, you\nunderstand, it is no longer a question of Nathan and his book, but of\nFrance and the glory of France. It is the duty of all honest and\ncourageous pens to make strenuous opposition to these foreign\nimportations. And with that you flatter your readers. Shrewd French\nmother-wit is not easily caught napping. If publishers, by ways which\nyou do not choose to specify, have stolen a success, the reading\npublic very soon judges for itself, and corrects the mistakes made by\nsome five hundred fools, who always rush to the fore.\n\n\"Say that the publisher who sold a first edition of the book is\naudacious indeed to issue a second, and express regret that so clever\na man does not know the taste of the country better. There is the gist\nof it. Just a sprinkle of the salt of wit and a dash of vinegar to\nbring out the flavor, and Dauriat will be done to a turn. But mind\nthat you end with seeming to pity Nathan for a mistake, and speak of\nhim as of a man from whom contemporary literature may look for great\nthings if he renounces these ways.\"\n\nLucien was amazed at this talk from Lousteau. As the journalist spoke,\nthe scales fell from his eyes; he beheld new truths of which he had\nnever before caught so much as a glimpse.\n\n\"But all this that you are saying is quite true and just,\" said he.\n\n\"If it were not, how could you make it tell against Nathan's book?\"\nasked Lousteau. \"That is the first manner of demolishing a book, my\nboy; it is the pickaxe style of criticism. But there are plenty of\nother ways. Your education will complete itself in time. When you are\nabsolutely obliged to speak of a man whom you do not like, for\nproprietors and editors are sometimes under compulsion, you bring out\na neutral special article. You put the title of the book at the head\nof it, and begin with general remarks, on the Greeks and the Romans if\nyou like, and wind up with--'and this brings us to Mr. So-and-so's\nbook, which will form the subject of a second article.' The second\narticle never appears, and in this way you snuff out the book between\ntwo promises. But in this case you are writing down, not Nathan, but\nDauriat; he needs the pickaxe style. If the book is really good, the\npickaxe does no harm; but it goes to the core of it if it is bad. In\nthe first case, no one but the publisher is any the worse; in the\nsecond, you do the public a service. Both methods, moreover, are\nequally serviceable in political criticism.\"\n\nEtienne Lousteau's cruel lesson opened up possibilities for Lucien's\nimagination. He understood this craft to admiration.\n\n\"Let us go to the office,\" said Lousteau; \"we shall find our friends\nthere, and we will agree among ourselves to charge at Nathan; they\nwill laugh, you will see.\"\n\nArrived in the Rue Saint-Fiacre, they went up to the room in the roof\nwhere the paper was made up, and Lucien was surprised and gratified no\nless to see the alacrity with which his comrades proceeded to demolish\nNathan's book. Hector Merlin took up a piece of paper and wrote a few\nlines for his own newspaper.--\n\n\n  \"A second edition of M. Nathan's book is announced. We had\n  intended to keep silence with regard to that work, but its\n  apparent success obliges us to publish an article, not so much\n  upon the book itself as upon certain tendencies of the new school\n  of literature.\"\n\n\nAt the head of the \"Facetiae\" in the morning's paper, Lousteau\ninserted the following note:--\n\n\n  \"M. Dauriat is bringing out a second edition of M. Nathan's book.\n  Evidently he does not know the legal maxim, _Non bis in idem_. All\n  honor to rash courage.\"\n\n\nLousteau's words had been like a torch for burning; Lucien's hot\ndesire to be revenged on Dauriat took the place of conscience and\ninspiration. For three days he never left Coralie's room; he sat at\nwork by the fire, waited upon by Berenice; petted, in moments of\nweariness, by the silent and attentive Coralie; till, at the end of\nthat time, he had made a fair copy of about three columns of\ncriticism, and an astonishingly good piece of work.\n\nIt was nine o'clock in the evening when he ran round to the office,\nfound his associates, and read over his work to an attentive audience.\nFelicien said not a syllable. He took up the manuscript, and made off\nwith it pell-mell down the staircase.\n\n\"What has come to him?\" cried Lucien.\n\n\"He has taken your article straight to the printer,\" said Hector\nMerlin. \"'Tis a masterpiece; not a line to add, nor a word to take\nout.\"\n\n\"There was no need to do more than show you the way,\" said Lousteau.\n\n\"I should like to see Nathan's face when he reads this to-morrow,\"\nsaid another contributor, beaming with gentle satisfaction.\n\n\"It is as well to have you for a friend,\" remarked Hector Merlin.\n\n\"Then it will do?\" Lucien asked quickly.\n\n\"Blondet and Vignon will feel bad,\" said Lousteau.\n\n\"Here is a short article which I have knocked together for you,\" began\nLucien; \"if it takes, I could write you a series.\"\n\n\"Read it over,\" said Lousteau, and Lucien read the first of the\ndelightful short papers which made the fortune of the little\nnewspaper; a series of sketches of Paris life, a portrait, a type, an\nordinary event, or some of the oddities of the great city. This\nspecimen--\"The Man in the Street\"--was written in a way that was fresh\nand original; the thoughts were struck out by the shock of the words,\nthe sounding ring of the adverbs and adjectives caught the reader's\near. The paper was as different from the serious and profound article\non Nathan as the _Lettres persanes_ from the _Esprit des lois_.\n\n\"You are a born journalist,\" said Lousteau. \"It shall go in to-morrow.\nDo as much of this sort of thing as you like.\"\n\n\"Ah, by the by,\" said Merlin, \"Dauriat is furious about those two\nbombshells hurled into his magazine. I have just come from him. He was\nhurling imprecations, and in such a rage with Finot, who told him that\nhe had sold his paper to you. As for me, I took him aside and just\nsaid a word in his ear. 'The _Marguerites_ will cost you dear,' I told\nhim. 'A man of talent comes to you, you turn the cold shoulder on him,\nand send him into the arms of the newspapers.'\"\n\n\"Dauriat will be dumfounded by the article on Nathan,\" said Lousteau.\n\"Do you see now what journalism is, Lucien? Your revenge is beginning\nto tell. The Baron Chatelet came here this morning for your address.\nThere was a cutting article upon him in this morning's issue; he is a\nweakling, that buck of the Empire, and he has lost his head. Have you\nseen the paper? It is a funny article. Look, 'Funeral of the Heron,\nand the Cuttlefish-bone's lament.' Mme. de Bargeton is called the\nCuttlefish-bone now, and no mistake, and Chatelet is known everywhere\nas Baron Heron.\"\n\nLucien took up the paper, and could not help laughing at Vernou's\nextremely clever skit.\n\n\"They will capitulate soon,\" said Hector Merlin.\n\nLucien merrily assisted at the manufacture of epigrams and jokes at\nthe end of the paper; and the associates smoked and chatted over the\nday's adventures, over the foibles of some among their number, or some\nnew bit of personal gossip. From their witty, malicious, bantering\ntalk, Lucien gained a knowledge of the inner life of literature, and\nof the manners and customs of the craft.\n\n\"While they are setting up the paper, I will go round with you and\nintroduce you to the managers of your theatres, and take you behind\nthe scenes,\" said Lousteau. \"And then we will go to the\nPanorama-Dramatique, and have a frolic in their dressing-rooms.\"\n\nArm-in-arm, they went from theatre to theatre. Lucien was introduced\nto this one and that, and enthroned as a dramatic critic. Managers\ncomplimented him, actresses flung him side glances; for every one of\nthem knew that this was the critic who, by a single article, had\ngained an engagement at the Gymnase, with twelve thousand francs a\nyear, for Coralie, and another for Florine at the Panorama-Dramatique\nwith eight thousand francs. Lucien was a man of importance. The little\novations raised Lucien in his own eyes, and taught him to know his\npower. At eleven o'clock the pair arrived at the Panorama-Dramatique;\nLucien with a careless air that worked wonders. Nathan was there.\nNathan held out a hand, which Lucien squeezed.\n\n\"Ah! my masters, so you have a mind to floor me, have you?\" said\nNathan, looking from one to the other.\n\n\"Just you wait till to-morrow, my dear fellow, and you shall see how\nLucien has taken you in hand. Upon my word, you will be pleased. A\npiece of serious criticism like that is sure to do a book good.\"\n\nLucien reddened with confusion.\n\n\"Is it severe?\" inquired Nathan.\n\n\"It is serious,\" said Lousteau.\n\n\"Then there is no harm done,\" Nathan rejoined. \"Hector Merlin in the\ngreenroom of the Vaudeville was saying that I had been cut up.\"\n\n\"Let him talk, and wait,\" cried Lucien, and took refuge in Coralie's\ndressing-room. Coralie, in her alluring costume, had just come off the\nstage.\n\n\n\nNext morning, as Lucien and Coralie sat at breakfast, a carriage drove\nalong the Rue de Vendome. The street was quiet enough, so that they\ncould hear the light sound made by an elegant cabriolet; and there was\nthat in the pace of the horse, and the manner of pulling up at the\ndoor, which tells unmistakably of a thoroughbred. Lucien went to the\nwindow, and there, in fact, beheld a splendid English horse, and no\nless a person than Dauriat flinging the reins to his man as he stepped\ndown.\n\n\"'Tis the publisher, Coralie,\" said Lucien.\n\n\"Let him wait, Berenice,\" Coralie said at once.\n\nLucien smiled at her presence of mind, and kissed her with a great\nrush of tenderness. This mere girl had made his interests hers in a\nwonderful way; she was quick-witted where he was concerned. The\napparition of the insolent publisher, the sudden and complete collapse\nof that prince of charlatans, was due to circumstances almost entirely\nforgotten, so utterly has the book trade changed during the last\nfifteen years.\n\nFrom 1816 to 1827, when newspaper reading-rooms were only just\nbeginning to lend new books, the fiscal law pressed more heavily than\never upon periodical publications, and necessity created the invention\nof advertisements. Paragraphs and articles in the newspapers were the\nonly means of advertisement known in those days; and French newspapers\nbefore the year 1822 were so small, that the largest sheet of those\ntimes was not so large as the smallest daily paper of ours. Dauriat\nand Ladvocat, the first publishers to make a stand against the tyranny\nof journalists, were also the first to use the placards which caught\nthe attention of Paris by strange type, striking colors, vignettes,\nand (at a later time) by lithograph illustrations, till a placard\nbecame a fairy-tale for the eyes, and not unfrequently a snare for the\npurse of the amateur. So much originality indeed was expended on\nplacards in Paris, that one of that peculiar kind of maniacs, known as\na collector, possesses a complete series.\n\nAt first the placard was confined to the shop-windows and stalls upon\nthe Boulevards in Paris; afterwards it spread all over France, till it\nwas supplanted to some extent by a return to advertisements in the\nnewspapers. But the placard, nevertheless, which continues to strike\nthe eye, after the advertisement and the book which is advertised are\nboth forgotten, will always be among us; it took a new lease of life\nwhen walls were plastered with posters.\n\nNewspaper advertising, the offspring of heavy stamp duties, a high\nrate of postage, and the heavy deposits of caution-money required by\nthe government as security for good behavior, is within the reach of\nall who care to pay for it, and has turned the fourth page of every\njournal into a harvest field alike for the speculator and the Inland\nRevenue Department. The press restrictions were invented in the time\nof M. de Villele, who had a chance, if he had but known it, of\ndestroying the power of journalism by allowing newspapers to multiply\ntill no one took any notice of them; but he missed his opportunity,\nand a sort of privilege was created, as it were, by the almost\ninsuperable difficulties put in the way of starting a new venture. So,\nin 1821, the periodical press might be said to have power of life and\ndeath over the creations of the brain and the publishing trade. A few\nlines among the items of news cost a fearful amount. Intrigues were\nmultiplied in newspaper offices; and of a night when the columns were\ndivided up, and this or that article was put in or left out to suit\nthe space, the printing-room became a sort of battlefield; so much so,\nthat the largest publishing firms had writers in their pay to insert\nshort articles in which many ideas are put in little space. Obscure\njournalists of this stamp were only paid after the insertion of the\nitems, and not unfrequently spent the night in the printing-office to\nmake sure that their contributions were not omitted; sometimes putting\nin a long article, obtained heaven knows how, sometimes a few lines of\na puff.\n\nThe manners and customs of journalism and of the publishing houses\nhave since changed so much, that many people nowadays will not believe\nwhat immense efforts were made by writers and publishers of books to\nsecure a newspaper puff; the martyrs of glory, and all those who are\ncondemned to the penal servitude of a life-long success, were reduced\nto such shifts, and stooped to depths of bribery and corruption as\nseem fabulous to-day. Every kind of persuasion was brought to bear on\njournalists--dinners, flattery, and presents. The following story will\nthrow more light on the close connection between the critic and the\npublisher than any quantity of flat assertions.\n\nThere was once upon a time an editor of an important paper, a clever\nwriter with a prospect of becoming a statesman; he was young in those\ndays, and fond of pleasure, and he became the favorite of a well-known\npublishing house. One Sunday the wealthy head of the firm was\nentertaining several of the foremost journalists of the time in the\ncountry, and the mistress of the house, then a young and pretty woman,\nwent to walk in her park with the illustrious visitor. The head-clerk\nof the firm, a cool, steady, methodical German with nothing but\nbusiness in his head, was discussing a project with one of the\njournalists, and as they chatted they walked on into the woods beyond\nthe park. In among the thickets the German thought he caught a glimpse\nof his hostess, put up his eyeglass, made a sign to his young\ncompanion to be silent, and turned back, stepping softly.--\"What did\nyou see?\" asked the journalist.--\"Nothing particular,\" said the clerk.\n\"Our affair of the long article is settled. To-morrow we shall have at\nleast three columns in the _Debats_.\"\n\nAnother anecdote will show the influence of a single article.\n\nA book of M. de Chateaubriand's on the last of the Stuarts was for\nsome time a \"nightingale\" on the bookseller's shelves. A single\narticle in the _Journal des Debats_ sold the work in a week. In those\ndays, when there were no lending libraries, a publisher would sell an\nedition of ten thousand copies of a book by a Liberal if it was well\nreviewed by the Opposition papers; but then the Belgian pirated\neditions were not as yet.\n\nThe preparatory attacks made by Lucien's friends, followed up by his\narticle on Nathan, proved efficacious; they stopped the sale of his\nbook. Nathan escaped with the mortification; he had been paid; he had\nnothing to lose; but Dauriat was like to lose thirty thousand francs.\nThe trade in new books may, in fact, be summed up much on this wise. A\nream of blank paper costs fifteen francs, a ream of printed paper is\nworth anything between a hundred sous and a hundred crowns, according\nto its success; a favorable or unfavorable review at a critical time\noften decides the question; and Dauriat having five hundred reams of\nprinted paper on hand, hurried to make terms with Lucien. The sultan\nwas now the slave.\n\nAfter waiting for some time, fidgeting and making as much noise as he\ncould while parleying with Berenice, he at last obtained speech of\nLucien; and, arrogant publisher though he was, he came in with the\nradiant air of a courtier in the royal presence, mingled, however,\nwith a certain self-sufficiency and easy good humor.\n\n\"Don't disturb yourselves, my little dears! How nice they look, just\nlike a pair of turtle-doves! Who would think now, mademoiselle, that\nhe, with that girl's face of his, could be a tiger with claws of\nsteel, ready to tear a reputation to rags, just as he tears your\nwrappers, I'll be bound, when you are not quick enough to unfasten\nthem,\" and he laughed before he had finished his jest.\n\n\"My dear boy----\" he began, sitting down beside Lucien.\n--\"Mademoiselle, I am Dauriat,\" he said, interrupting himself. He\njudged it expedient to fire his name at her like a pistol shot, for\nhe considered that Coralie was less cordial than she should have been.\n\n\"Have you breakfasted, monsieur; will you keep us company?\" asked\nCoralie.\n\n\"Why, yes; it is easier to talk at table,\" said Dauriat. \"Besides, by\naccepting your invitation I shall have a right to expect you to dine\nwith my friend Lucien here, for we must be close friends now, hand and\nglove!\"\n\n\"Berenice! Bring oysters, lemons, fresh butter, and champagne,\" said\nCoralie.\n\n\"You are too clever not to know what has brought me here,\" said\nDauriat, fixing his eyes on Lucien.\n\n\"You have come to buy my sonnets.\"\n\n\"Precisely. First of all, let us lay down our arms on both sides.\" As\nhe spoke he took out a neat pocketbook, drew from it three bills for a\nthousand francs each, and laid them before Lucien with a suppliant\nair. \"Is monsieur content?\" asked he.\n\n\"Yes,\" said the poet. A sense of beatitude, for which no words exist,\nflooded his soul at the sight of that unhoped wealth. He controlled\nhimself, but he longed to sing aloud, to jump for joy; he was ready to\nbelieve in Aladdin's lamp and in enchantment; he believed in his own\ngenius, in short.\n\n\"Then the _Marguerites_ are mine,\" continued Dauriat; \"but you will\nundertake not to attack my publications, won't you?\"\n\n\"The _Marguerites_ are yours, but I cannot pledge my pen; it is at the\nservice of my friends, as theirs are mine.\"\n\n\"But you are one of my authors now. All my authors are my friends. So\nyou won't spoil my business without warning me beforehand, so that I\nam prepared, will you?\"\n\n\"I agree to that.\"\n\n\"To your fame!\" and Dauriat raised his glass.\n\n\"I see that you have read the _Marguerites_,\" said Lucien.\n\nDauriat was not disconcerted.\n\n\"My boy, a publisher cannot pay a greater compliment than by buying\nyour _Marguerites_ unread. In six months' time you will be a great poet.\nYou will be written up; people are afraid of you; I shall have no\ndifficulty in selling your book. I am the same man of business that I\nwas four days ago. It is not I who have changed; it is _you_. Last week\nyour sonnets were so many cabbage leaves for me; to-day your position\nhas ranked them beside Delavigne.\"\n\n\"Ah well,\" said Lucien, \"if you have not read my sonnets, you have\nread my article.\" With the sultan's pleasure of possessing a fair\nmistress, and the certainty of success, he had grown satirical and\nadorably impertinent of late.\n\n\"Yes, my friend; do you think I should have come here in such a hurry\nbut for that? That terrible article of yours is very well written,\nworse luck. Oh! you have a very great gift, my boy. Take my advice and\nmake the most of your vogue,\" he added, with good humor, which masked\nthe extreme insolence of the speech. \"But have you yourself a copy of\nthe paper? Have you seen your article in print?\"\n\n\"Not yet,\" said Lucien, \"though this is the first long piece of prose\nwhich I have published; but Hector will have sent a copy to my address\nin the Rue Charlot.\"\n\n\"Here--read!\" . . . cried Dauriat, copying Talma's gesture in _Manlius_.\n\nLucien took the paper but Coralie snatched it from him.\n\n\"The first-fruits of your pen belong to me, as you well know,\" she\nlaughed.\n\nDauriat was unwontedly courtier-like and complimentary. He was afraid\nof Lucien, and therefore he asked him to a great dinner which he was\ngiving to a party of journalists towards the end of the week, and\nCoralie was included in the invitation. He took the _Marguerites_ away\nwith him when he went, asking _his_ poet to look in when he pleased in\nthe Wooden Galleries, and the agreement should be ready for his\nsignature. Dauriat never forgot the royal airs with which he\nendeavored to overawe superficial observers, and to impress them with\nthe notion that he was a Maecenas rather than a publisher; at this\nmoment he left the three thousand francs, waving away in lordly\nfashion the receipt which Lucien offered, kissed Coralie's hand, and\ntook his departure.\n\n\"Well, dear love, would you have seen many of these bits of paper if\nyou had stopped in your hole in the Rue de Cluny, prowling about among\nthe musty old books in the Bibliotheque de Sainte-Genevieve?\" asked\nCoralie, for she knew the whole story of Lucien's life by this time.\n\"Those little friends of yours in the Rue des Quatre-Vents are great\nninnies, it seems to me.\"\n\nHis brothers of the _cenacle_! And Lucien could hear the verdict and\nlaugh.\n\nHe had seen himself in print; he had just experienced the ineffable\njoy of the author, that first pleasurable thrill of gratified vanity\nwhich comes but once. The full import and bearing of his article\nbecame apparent to him as he read and re-read it. The garb of print is\nto manuscript as the stage is to women; it brings beauties and defects\nto light, killing and giving life; the fine thoughts and the faults\nalike stare you in the face.\n\nLucien, in his excitement and rapture, gave not another thought to\nNathan. Nathan was a stepping-stone for him--that was all; and he\n(Lucien) was happy exceedingly--he thought himself rich. The money\nbrought by Dauriat was a very Potosi for the lad who used to go about\nunnoticed through the streets of Angouleme and down the steep path\ninto L'Houmeau to Postel's garret, where his whole family had lived\nupon an income of twelve hundred francs. The pleasures of his life in\nParis must inevitably dim the memories of those days; but so keen were\nthey, that, as yet, he seemed to be back again in the Place du Murier.\nHe thought of Eve, his beautiful, noble sister, of David his friend,\nand of his poor mother, and he sent Berenice out to change one of the\nnotes. While she went he wrote a few lines to his family, and on the\nmaid's return he sent her to the coach-office with a packet of five\nhundred francs addressed to his mother. He could not trust himself; he\nwanted to sent the money at once; later he might not be able to do it.\nBoth Lucien and Coralie looked upon this restitution as a meritorious\naction. Coralie put her arms about her lover and kissed him, and\nthought him a model son and brother; she could not make enough of him,\nfor generosity is a trait of character which delights these kindly\ncreatures, who always carry their hearts in their hands.\n\n\"We have a dinner now every day for a week,\" she said; \"we will make a\nlittle carnival; you have worked quite hard enough.\"\n\n\n\nCoralie, fain to delight in the beauty of a man whom all other women\nshould envy her, took Lucien back to Staub. He was not dressed finely\nenough for her. Thence the lovers went to drive in the Bois de\nBoulogne, and came back to dine at Mme. du Val-Noble's. Rastignac,\nBixiou, des Lupeaulx, Finot, Blondet, Vignon, the Baron de Nucingen,\nBeaudenord, Philippe Bridau, Conti, the great musician, all the\nartists and speculators, all the men who seek for violent sensations\nas a relief from immense labors, gave Lucien a welcome among them. And\nLucien had gained confidence; he gave himself out in talk as though he\nhad not to live by his wit, and was pronounced to be a \"clever fellow\"\nin the slang of the coterie of semi-comrades.\n\n\"Oh! we must wait and see what he has in him,\" said Theodore Gaillard,\na poet patronized by the Court, who thought of starting a Royalist\npaper to be entitled the _Reveil_ at a later day.\n\nAfter dinner, Merlin and Lucien, Coralie and Mme. du Val-Noble, went\nto the Opera, where Merlin had a box. The whole party adjourned\nthither, and Lucien triumphant reappeared upon the scene of his first\nserious check.\n\nHe walked in the lobby, arm in arm with Merlin and Blondet, looking\nthe dandies who had once made merry at his expense between the eyes.\nChatelet was under his feet. He clashed glances with de Marsay,\nVandenesse, and Manerville, the bucks of that day. And indeed Lucien,\nbeautiful and elegantly arrayed, had caused a discussion in the\nMarquise d'Espard's box; Rastignac had paid a long visit, and the\nMarquise and Mme. de Bargeton put up their opera-glasses at Coralie.\nDid the sight of Lucien send a pang of regret through Mme. de\nBargeton's heart? This thought was uppermost in the poet's mind. The\nlonging for revenge aroused in him by the sight of the Corinne of\nAngouleme was as fierce as on that day when the lady and her cousin\nhad cut him in the Champs-Elysees.\n\n\"Did you bring an amulet with you from the provinces?\"--It was Blondet\nwho made this inquiry some few days later, when he called at eleven\no'clock in the morning and found that Lucien was not yet risen.--\"His\ngood looks are making ravages from cellar to garret, high and low,\"\ncontinued Blondet, kissing Coralie on the forehead. \"I have come to\nenlist you, dear fellow,\" he continued, grasping Lucien by the hand.\n\"Yesterday, at the Italiens, the Comtesse de Montcornet asked me to\nbring you to her house. You will not give a refusal to a charming\nwoman? You meet people of the first fashion there.\"\n\n\"If Lucien is nice, he will not go to see your Countess,\" put in\nCoralie. \"What call is there for him to show his face in fine society?\nHe would only be bored there.\"\n\n\"Have you a vested interest in him? Are you jealous of fine ladies?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" cried Coralie. \"They are worse than we are.\"\n\n\"How do you know that, my pet?\" asked Blondet.\n\n\"From their husbands,\" retorted she. \"You are forgetting that I once\nhad six months of de Marsay.\"\n\n\"Do you suppose, child, that _I_ am particularly anxious to take such\na handsome fellow as your poet to Mme. de Montcornet's house? If you\nobject, let us consider that nothing has been said. But I don't fancy\nthat the women are so much in question as a poor devil that Lucien\npilloried in his newspaper; he is begging for mercy and peace. The\nBaron du Chatelet is imbecile enough to take the thing seriously. The\nMarquise d'Espard, Mme. de Bargeton, and Mme. de Montcornet's set have\ntaken up the Heron's cause; and I have undertaken to reconcile\nPetrarch and his Laura--Mme. de Bargeton and Lucien.\"\n\n\"Aha!\" cried Lucien, the glow of the intoxication of revenge throbbing\nfull-pulsed through every vein. \"Aha! so my foot is on their necks!\nYou make me adore my pen, worship my friends, bow down to the\nfate-dispensing power of the press. I have not written a single\nsentence as yet upon the Heron and the Cuttlefish-bone.--I will go with\nyou, my boy,\" he cried, catching Blondet by the waist; \"yes, I will go;\nbut first, the couple shall feel the weight of _this_, for so light as\nit is.\" He flourished the pen which had written the article upon Nathan.\n\n\"To-morrow,\" he cried, \"I will hurl a couple of columns at their\nheads. Then, we shall see. Don't be frightened, Coralie, it is not\nlove but revenge; revenge! And I will have it to the full!\"\n\n\"What a man it is!\" said Blondet. \"If you but knew, Lucien, how rare\nsuch explosions are in this jaded Paris, you might appreciate\nyourself. You will be a precious scamp\" (the actual expression was a\ntrifle stronger); \"you are in a fair way to be a power in the land.\"\n\n\"He will get on,\" said Coralie.\n\n\"Well, he has come a good way already in six weeks.\"\n\n\"And if he should climb so high that he can reach a sceptre by\ntreading over a corpse, he shall have Coralie's body for a\nstepping-stone,\" said the girl.\n\n\"You are a pair of lovers of the Golden Age,\" said Blondet.--\"I\ncongratulate you on your big article,\" he added, turning to Lucien.\n\"There were a lot of new things in it. You are past master!\"\n\nLousteau called with Hector Merlin and Vernou. Lucien was immensely\nflattered by this attention. Felicien Vernou brought a hundred francs\nfor Lucien's article; it was felt that such a contributor must be well\npaid to attach him to the paper.\n\nCoralie, looking round at the chapter of journalists, ordered in a\nbreakfast from the _Cadran bleu_, the nearest restaurant, and asked her\nvisitors to adjourn to her handsomely furnished dining-room when\nBerenice announced that the meal was ready. In the middle of the\nrepast, when the champagne had gone to all heads, the motive of the\nvisit came out.\n\n\"You do not mean to make an enemy of Nathan, do you?\" asked Lousteau.\n\"Nathan is a journalist, and he has friends; he might play you an ugly\ntrick with your first book. You have your _Archer of Charles IX._ to\nsell, have you not? We went round to Nathan this morning; he is in a\nterrible way. But you will set about another article, and puff praise\nin his face.\"\n\n\"What! After my article against his book, would you have me say----\"\nbegan Lucien.\n\nThe whole party cut him short with a shout of laughter.\n\n\"Did you ask him to supper here the day after to-morrow?\" asked\nBlondet.\n\n\"You article was not signed,\" added Lousteau. \"Felicien, not being\nquite such a new hand as you are, was careful to put an initial C at\nthe bottom. You can do that now with all your articles in his paper,\nwhich is pure unadulterated Left. We are all of us in the Opposition.\nFelicien was tactful enough not to compromise your future opinions.\nHector's shop is Right Centre; you might sign your work on it with an\nL. If you cut a man up, you do it anonymously; if you praise him, it\nis just as well to put your name to your article.\"\n\n\"It is not the signatures that trouble me,\" returned Lucien, \"but I\ncannot see anything to be said in favor of the book.\"\n\n\"Then did you really think as you wrote?\" asked Hector.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Oh! I thought you were cleverer than that, youngster,\" said Blondet.\n\"No. Upon my word, as I looked at that forehead of yours, I credited\nyou with the omnipotence of the great mind--the power of seeing both\nsides of everything. In literature, my boy, every idea is reversible,\nand no man can take upon himself to decide which is the right or wrong\nside. Everything is bi-lateral in the domain of thought. Ideas are\nbinary. Janus is a fable signifying criticism and the symbol of\nGenius. The Almighty alone is triform. What raises Moliere and\nCorneille above the rest of us but the faculty of saying one thing\nwith an Alceste or an Octave, and another with a Philinte or a Cinna?\nRousseau wrote a letter against dueling in the _Nouvelle_ Heloise, and\nanother in favor of it. Which of the two represented his own opinion?\nwill you venture to take it upon yourself to decide? Which of us could\ngive judgement for Clarissa or Lovelace, Hector or Achilles? Who was\nHomer's hero? What did Richardson himself think? It is the function of\ncriticism to look at a man's work in all its aspects. We draw up our\ncase, in short.\"\n\n\"Do you really stick to your written opinions?\" asked Vernou, with a\nsatirical expression. \"Why, we are retailers of phrases; that is how\nwe make a livelihood. When you try to do a good piece of work--to\nwrite a book, in short--you can put your thoughts, yourself into it,\nand cling to it, and fight for it; but as for newspaper articles, read\nto-day and forgotten to-morrow, they are worth nothing in my eyes but\nthe money that is paid for them. If you attach any importance to such\ndrivel, you might as well make the sign of the Cross and invoke heaven\nwhen you sit down to write a tradesman's circular.\"\n\nEvery one apparently was astonished at Lucien's scruples. The last\nrags of the boyish conscience were torn away, and he was invested with\nthe _toga virilis_ of journalism.\n\n\"Do you know what Nathan said by way of comforting himself after your\ncriticism?\" asked Lousteau.\n\n\"How should I know?\"\n\n\"Nathan exclaimed, 'Paragraphs pass away; but a great work lives!' He\nwill be here to supper in two days, and he will be sure to fall flat\nat your feet, and kiss your claws, and swear that you are a great\nman.\"\n\n\"That would be a funny thing,\" was Lucien's comment.\n\n\"_Funny_\" repeated Blondet. \"He can't help himself.\"\n\n\"I am quite willing, my friends,\" said Lucien, on whom the wine had\nbegun to take effect. \"But what am I to say?\"\n\n\"Oh well, refute yourself in three good columns in Merlin's paper. We\nhave been enjoying the sight of Nathan's wrath; we have just been\ntelling him that he owes us no little gratitude for getting up a hot\ncontroversy that will sell his second edition in a week. In his eyes\nat this present moment you are a spy, a scoundrel, a caitiff wretch;\nthe day after to-morrow you will be a genius, an uncommonly clever\nfellow, one of Plutarch's men. Nathan will hug you and call you his\nbest friend. Dauriat has been to see you; you have your three thousand\nfrancs; you have worked the trick! Now you want Nathan's respect and\nesteem. Nobody ought to be let in except the publisher. We must not\nimmolate any one but an enemy. We should not talk like this if it were\na question of some outsider, some inconvenient person who had made a\nname for himself without us and was not wanted; but Nathan is one of\nus. Blondet got some one to attack him in the _Mercure_ for the pleasure\nof replying in the _Debats_. For which reason the first edition went off\nat once.\"\n\n\"My friends, upon my word and honor, I cannot write two words in\npraise of that book----\"\n\n\"You will have another hundred francs,\" interrupted Merlin. \"Nathan\nwill have brought you in ten louis d'or, to say nothing of an article\nthat you might put in Finot's paper; you would get a hundred francs\nfor writing that, and another hundred francs from Dauriat--total,\ntwenty louis.\"\n\n\"But what am I to say?\"\n\n\"Here is your way out of the difficulty,\" said Blondet, after some\nthought. \"Say that the envy that fastens on all good work, like wasps\non ripe fruit, has attempted to set its fangs in this production. The\ncaptious critic, trying his best to find fault, has been obliged to\ninvent theories for that purpose, and has drawn a distinction between\ntwo kinds of literature--'the literature of ideas and the literature\nof imagery,' as he calls them. On the heads of that, youngster, say\nthat to give expression to ideas through imagery is the highest form\nof art. Try to show that all poetry is summed up in that, and lament\nthat there is so little poetry in French; quote foreign criticisms on\nthe unimaginative precision of our style, and then extol M. de Canalis\nand Nathan for the services they have done France by infusing a less\nprosaic spirit into the language. Knock your previous argument to\npieces by calling attention to the fact that we have made progress\nsince the eighteenth century. (Discover the 'progress,' a beautiful\nword to mystify the bourgeois public.) Say that the new methods in\nliterature concentrate all styles, comedy and tragedy, description,\ncharacter-drawing and dialogues, in a series of pictures set in the\nbrilliant frame of a plot which holds the reader's interest. The\nNovel, which demands sentiment, style, and imagery, is the greatest\ncreation of modern days; it is the successor of stage comedy grown\nobsolete with its restrictions. Facts and ideas are all within the\nprovince of fiction. The intellect of an incisive moralist, like La\nBruyere, the power of treating character as Moliere could treat it,\nthe grand machinery of a Shakespeare, together with the portrayal of\nthe most subtle shades of passion (the one treasury left untouched by\nour predecessors)--for all this the modern novel affords free scope.\nHow far superior is all this to the cut-and-dried logic-chopping, the\ncold analysis to the eighteenth century!--'The Novel,' say\nsententiously, 'is the Epic grown amusing.' Instance _Corinne_, bring\nMme. de Stael up to support your argument. The eighteenth century\ncalled all things in question; it is the task of the nineteenth to\nconclude and speak the last word; and the last word of the nineteenth\ncentury has been for realities--realities which live however and move.\nPassion, in short, an element unknown in Voltaire's philosophy, has\nbeen brought into play. Here a diatribe against Voltaire, and as for\nRousseau, his characters are polemics and systems masquerading. Julie\nand Claire are entelechies--informing spirit awaiting flesh and bones.\n\n\"You might slip off on a side issue at this, and say that we owe a new\nand original literature to the Peace and the Restoration of the\nBourbons, for you are writing for a Right Centre paper.\n\n\"Scoff at Founders of Systems. And cry with a glow of fine enthusiasm,\n'Here are errors and misleading statements in abundance in our\ncontemporary's work, and to what end? To depreciate a fine work, to\ndeceive the public, and to arrive at this conclusion--\"A book that\nsells, does not sell.\"' _Proh pudor_! (Mind you put _Proh pudor_! 'tis a\nharmless expletive that stimulates the reader's interest.) Foresee the\napproaching decadence of criticism, in fact. Moral--'There is but one\nkind of literature, the literature which aims to please. Nathan has\nstarted upon a new way; he understands his epoch and fulfils the\nrequirements of his age--the demand for drama, the natural demand of a\ncentury in which the political stage has become a permanent puppet\nshow. Have we not seen four dramas in a score of years--the\nRevolution, the Directory, the Empire, and the Restoration?' With\nthat, wallow in dithyramb and eulogy, and the second edition shall\nvanish like smoke. This is the way to do it. Next Saturday put a\nreview in our magazine, and sign it 'de Rubempre,' out in full.\n\n\"In that final article say that 'fine work always brings about\nabundant controversy. This week such and such a paper contained such\nand such an article on Nathan's book, and such another paper made a\nvigorous reply.' Then you criticise the critics 'C' and 'L'; pay me a\npassing compliment on the first article in the _Debats_, and end by\naverring that Nathan's work is the great book of the epoch; which is\nall as if you said nothing at all; they say the same of everything\nthat comes out.\n\n\"And so,\" continued Blondet, \"you will have made four hundred francs\nin a week, to say nothing of the pleasure of now and again saying what\nyou really think. A discerning public will maintain that either C or L\nor Rubempre is in the right of it, or mayhap all the three. Mythology,\nbeyond doubt one of the grandest inventions of the human brain, places\nTruth at the bottom of a well; and what are we to do without buckets?\nYou will have supplied the public with three for one. There you are,\nmy boy, Go ahead!\"\n\nLucien's head was swimming with bewilderment. Blondet kissed him on\nboth cheeks.\n\n\"I am going to my shop,\" said he. And every man likewise departed to\nhis shop. For these \"_hommes forts_,\" a newspaper office was nothing but\na shop.\n\nThey were to meet again in the evening at the Wooden Galleries, and\nLucien would sign his treaty of peace with Dauriat. Florine and\nLousteau, Lucien and Coralie, Blondet and Finot, were to dine at the\nPalais-Royal; du Bruel was giving the manager of the\nPanorama-Dramatique a dinner.\n\n\"They are right,\" exclaimed Lucien, when he was alone with Coralie.\n\"Men are made to be tools in the hands of stronger spirits. Four\nhundred francs for three articles! Doguereau would scarcely give me as\nmuch for a book which cost me two years of work.\"\n\n\"Write criticism,\" said Coralie, \"have a good time! Look at me, I am\nan Andalusian girl to-night, to-morrow I may be a gypsy, and a man the\nnight after. Do as I do, give them grimaces for their money, and let\nus live happily.\"\n\nLucien, smitten with love of Paradox, set himself to mount and ride\nthat unruly hybrid product of Pegasus and Balaam's ass; started out at\na gallop over the fields of thought while he took a turn in the Bois,\nand discovered new possibilities in Blondet's outline.\n\nHe dined as happy people dine, and signed away all his rights in the\n_Marguerites_. It never occurred to him that any trouble might arise\nfrom that transaction in the future. He took a turn of work at the\noffice, wrote off a couple of columns, and came back to the Rue de\nVendome. Next morning he found the germs of yesterday's ideas had\nsprung up and developed in his brain, as ideas develop while the\nintellect is yet unjaded and the sap is rising; and thoroughly did he\nenjoy the projection of this new article. He threw himself into it\nwith enthusiasm. At the summons of the spirit of contradiction, new\ncharms met beneath his pen. He was witty and satirical, he rose to yet\nnew views of sentiment, of ideas and imagery in literature. With\nsubtle ingenuity, he went back to his own first impressions of\nNathan's work, when he read it in the newsroom of the Cour du\nCommerce; and the ruthless, bloodthirsty critic, the lively mocker,\nbecame a poet in the final phrases which rose and fell with majestic\nrhythm like the swaying censer before the altar.\n\n\"One hundred francs, Coralie!\" cried he, holding up eight sheets of\npaper covered with writing while she dressed.\n\nThe mood was upon him; he went on to indite, stroke by stroke, the\npromised terrible article on Chatelet and Mme. de Bargeton. That\nmorning he experienced one of the keenest personal pleasures of\njournalism; he knew what it was to forge the epigram, to whet and\npolish the cold blade to be sheathed in a victim's heart, to make of\nthe hilt a cunning piece of workmanship for the reader to admire. For\nthe public admires the handle, the delicate work of the brain, while\nthe cruelty is not apparent; how should the public know that the steel\nof the epigram, tempered in the fire of revenge, has been plunged\ndeftly, to rankle in the very quick of a victim's vanity, and is\nreeking from wounds innumerable which it has inflicted? It is a\nhideous joy, that grim, solitary pleasure, relished without witnesses;\nit is like a duel with an absent enemy, slain at a distance by a\nquill; a journalist might really possess the magical power of\ntalismans in Eastern tales. Epigram is distilled rancor, the\nquintessence of a hate derived from all the worst passions of man,\neven as love concentrates all that is best in human nature. The man\ndoes not exist who cannot be witty to avenge himself; and, by the same\nrule, there is not one to whom love does not bring delight. Cheap and\neasy as this kind of wit may be in France, it is always relished.\nLucien's article was destined to raise the previous reputation of the\npaper for venomous spite and evil-speaking. His article probed two\nhearts to the depths; it dealt a grievous wound to Mme. de Bargeton,\nhis Laura of old days, as well as to his rival, the Baron du Chatelet.\n\n\"Well, let us go for a drive in the Bois,\" said Coralie, \"the horses\nare fidgeting. There is no need to kill yourself.\"\n\n\"We will take the article on Nathan to Hector. Journalism is really\nvery much like Achilles' lance, it salves the wounds that it makes,\"\nsaid Lucien, correcting a phrase here and there.\n\nThe lovers started forth in splendor to show themselves to the Paris\nwhich had but lately given Lucien the cold shoulder, and now was\nbeginning to talk about him. To have Paris talking of you! and this\nafter you have learned how large the great city is, how hard it is to\nbe anybody there--it was this thought that turned Lucien's head with\nexultation.\n\n\"Let us go by way of your tailor's, dear boy, and tell him to be quick\nwith your clothes, or try them on if they are ready. If you are going\nto your fine ladies' houses, you shall eclipse that monster of a de\nMarsay and young Rastignac and any Ajuda-Pinto or Maxime de Trailles\nor Vandenesse of them all. Remember that your mistress is Coralie! But\nyou will not play me any tricks, eh?\"\n\nTwo days afterwards, on the eve of the supper-party at Coralie's\nhouse, there was a new play at the Ambigu, and it fell to Lucien to\nwrite the dramatic criticism. Lucien and Coralie walked together after\ndinner from the Rue de Vendome to the Panorama-Dramatique, going along\nthe Cafe Turc side of the Boulevard du Temple, a lounge much\nfrequented at that time. People wondered at his luck, and praised\nCoralie's beauty. Chance remarks reached his ears; some said that\nCoralie was the finest woman in Paris, others that Lucien was a match\nfor her. The romantic youth felt that he was in his atmosphere. This\nwas the life for him. The brotherhood was so far away that it was\nalmost out of sight. Only two months ago, how he had looked up to\nthose lofty great natures; now he asked himself if they were not just\na trifle ridiculous with their notions and their Puritanism. Coralie's\ncareless words had lodged in Lucien's mind, and begun already to bear\nfruit. He took Coralie to her dressing-room, and strolled about like a\nsultan behind the scenes; the actresses gave him burning glances and\nflattering speeches.\n\n\"I must go to the Ambigu and attend to business,\" said he.\n\nAt the Ambigu the house was full; there was not a seat left for him.\nIndignant complaints behind the scenes brought no redress; the\nbox-office keeper, who did not know him as yet, said that they had sent\norders for two boxes to his paper, and sent him about his business.\n\n\"I shall speak of the play as I find it,\" said Lucien, nettled at\nthis.\n\n\"What a dunce you are!\" said the leading lady, addressing the\nbox-office keeper, \"that is Coralie's adorer.\"\n\nThe box-office keeper turned round immediately at this. \"I will speak\nto the manager at once, sir,\" he said.\n\nIn all these small details Lucien saw the immense power wielded by the\npress. His vanity was gratified. The manager appeared to say that the\nDuc de Rhetore and Tullia the opera-dancer were in the stage-box, and\nthey had consented to allow Lucien to join them.\n\n\"You have driven two people to distraction,\" remarked the young Duke,\nmentioning the names of the Baron du Chatelet and Mme. de Bargeton.\n\n\"Distraction? What will it be to-morrow?\" said Lucien. \"So far, my\nfriends have been mere skirmishers, but I have given them red-hot shot\nto-night. To-morrow you will know why we are making game of 'Potelet.'\nThe article is called 'Potelet from 1811 to 1821.' Chatelet will be a\nbyword, a name for the type of courtiers who deny their benefactor and\nrally to the Bourbons. When I have done with him, I am going to Mme.\nde Montcornet's.\"\n\nLucien's talk was sparkling. He was eager that this great personage\nshould see how gross a mistake Mesdames d'Espard and de Bargeton had\nmade when they slighted Lucien de Rubempre. But he showed the tip of\nhis ear when he asserted his right to bear the name of Rubempre, the\nDuc de Rhetore having purposely addressed him as Chardon.\n\n\"You should go over to the Royalists,\" said the Duke. \"You have proved\nyourself a man of ability; now show your good sense. The one way of\nobtaining a patent of nobility and the right to bear the title of your\nmother's family, is by asking for it in return for services to be\nrendered to the Court. The Liberals will never make a count of you.\nThe Restoration will get the better of the press, you see, in the long\nrun, and the press is the only formidable power. They have borne with\nit too long as it is; the press is sure to be muzzled. Take advantage\nof the last moments of liberty to make yourself formidable, and you\nwill have everything--intellect, nobility, and good looks; nothing\nwill be out of your reach. So if you are a Liberal, let it be simply\nfor the moment, so that you can make a better bargain for your\nRoyalism.\"\n\nWith that the Duke entreated Lucien to accept an invitation to dinner,\nwhich the German Minister (of Florine's supper-party) was about to\nsend. Lucien fell under the charm of the noble peer's arguments; the\nsalons from which he had been exiled for ever, as he thought, but a\nfew months ago, would shortly open their doors for him! He was\ndelighted. He marveled at the power of the press; Intellect and the\nPress, these then were the real powers in society. Another thought\nshaped itself in his mind--Was Etienne Lousteau sorry that he had\nopened the gate of the temple to a newcomer? Even now he (Lucien) felt\non his own account that it was strongly advisable to put difficulties\nin the way of eager and ambitious recruits from the provinces. If a\npoet should come to him as he had flung himself into Etienne's arms,\nhe dared not think of the reception that he would give him.\n\nThe youthful Duke meanwhile saw that Lucien was deep in thought, and\nmade a pretty good guess at the matter of his meditations. He himself\nhad opened out wide horizons of public life before an ambitious poet,\nwith a vacillating will, it is true, but not without aspirations; and\nthe journalists had already shown the neophyte, from a pinnacle of the\ntemple, all the kingdoms of the world of letters and its riches.\n\nLucien himself had no suspicion of a little plot that was being woven,\nnor did he imagine that M. de Rhetore had a hand in it. M. de Rhetore\nhad spoken of Lucien's cleverness, and Mme. d'Espard's set had taken\nalarm. Mme. de Bargeton had commissioned the Duke to sound Lucien, and\nwith that object in view, the noble youth had come to the\nAmbigu-Comique.\n\nDo not believe in stories of elaborate treachery. Neither the great\nworld nor the world of journalists laid any deep schemes; definite\nplans are not made by either; their Machiavelism lives from hand to\nmouth, so to speak, and consists, for the most part, in being always\non the spot, always on the alert to turn everything to account, always\non the watch for the moment when a man's ruling passion shall deliver\nhim into the hands of his enemies. The young Duke had seen through\nLucien at Florine's supper-party; he had just touched his vain\nsusceptibilities; and now he was trying his first efforts in diplomacy\nupon the living subject.\n\nLucien hurried to the Rue Saint-Fiacre after the play to write his\narticle. It was a piece of savage and bitter criticism, written in\npure wantonness; he was amusing himself by trying his power. The\nmelodrama, as a matter of fact, was a better piece than the _Alcalde_;\nbut Lucien wished to see whether he could damn a good play and send\neverybody to see a bad one, as his associates had said.\n\nHe unfolded the sheet at breakfast next morning, telling Coralie as he\ndid so that he had cut up the Ambigu-Comique; and not a little\nastonished was he to find below his paper on Mme. de Bargeton and\nChatelet a notice of the Ambigu, so mellowed and softened in the\ncourse of the night, that although the witty analysis was still\npreserved, the judgment was favorable. The article was more likely to\nfill the house than to empty it. No words can describe his wrath. He\ndetermined to have a word or two with Lousteau. He had already begun\nto think himself an indespensable man, and he vowed that he would not\nsubmit to be tyrannized over and treated like a fool. To establish his\npower beyond cavil, he wrote the article for Dauriat's review, summing\nup and weighing all the various opinions concerning Nathan's book; and\nwhile he was in the humor, he hit off another of his short sketches\nfor Lousteau's newspaper. Inexperienced journalists, in the first\neffervescence of youth, make a labor of love of ephemeral work, and\nlavish their best thought unthriftily thereon.\n\nThe manager of the Panorama-Dramatique gave a first performance of a\nvaudeville that night, so that Florine and Coralie might be free for\nthe evening. There were to be cards before supper. Lousteau came for\nthe short notice of the vaudeville; it had been written beforehand\nafter the general rehearsal, for Etienne wished to have the paper off\nhis mind. Lucien read over one of the charming sketches of Parisian\nwhimsicalities which made the fortune of the paper, and Lousteau\nkissed him on both eyelids, and called him the providence of\njournalism.\n\n\"Then why do you amuse yourself by turning my article inside out?\"\nasked Lucien. He had written his brilliant sketch simply and solely to\ngive emphasis to his grievance.\n\n\"_I_?\" exclaimed Lousteau.\n\n\"Well, who else can have altered my article?\"\n\n\"You do not know all the ins and outs yet, dear fellow. The Ambigu\npays for thirty copies, and only takes nine for the manager and box\noffice-keeper and their mistresses, and for the three lessees of the\ntheatre. Every one of the Boulevard theatres pays eight hundred francs\nin this way to the paper; and there is quite as much again in boxes\nand orders for Finot, to say nothing of the contributions of the\ncompany. And if the minor theatres do this, you may imagine what the\nbig ones do! Now you understand? We are bound to show a good deal of\nindulgence.\"\n\n\"I understand this, that I am not at liberty to write as I think----\"\n\n\"Eh! what does that matter, so long as you turn an honest penny?\"\ncried Lousteau. \"Besides, my boy, what grudge had you against the\ntheatre? You must have had some reason for it, or you would not have\ncut up the play as you did. If you slash for the sake of slashing, the\npaper will get into trouble, and when there is good reason for hitting\nhard it will not tell. Did the manager leave you out in the cold?\"\n\n\"He had not kept a place for me.\"\n\n\"Good,\" said Lousteau. \"I shall let him see your article, and tell him\nthat I softened it down; you will find it serves you better than if it\nhad appeared in print. Go and ask him for tickets to-morrow, and he\nwill sign forty blank orders every month. I know a man who can get rid\nof them for you; I will introduce you to him, and he will buy them all\nup at half-price. There is a trade done in theatre tickets, just as\nBarbet trades in reviewers' copies. This is another Barbet, the leader\nof the _claque_. He lives near by; come and see him, there is time\nenough.\"\n\n\"But, my dear fellow, it is a scandalous thing that Finot should levy\nblackmail in matters intellectual. Sooner or later----\"\n\n\"Really!\" cried Lousteau, \"where do you come from? For what do you\ntake Finot? Beneath his pretence of good-nature, his ignorance and\nstupidity, and those Turcaret's airs of his, there is all the cunning\nof his father the hatter. Did you notice an old soldier of the Empire\nin the den at the office? That is Finot's uncle. The uncle is not only\none of the right sort, he has the luck to be taken for a fool; and he\ntakes all that kind of business upon his shoulders. An ambitious man\nin Paris is well off indeed if he has a willing scapegoat at hand. In\npublic life, as in journalism, there are hosts of emergencies in which\nthe chiefs cannot afford to appear. If Finot should enter on a\npolitical career, his uncle would be his secretary, and receive all\nthe contributions levied in his department on big affairs. Anybody\nwould take Giroudeau for a fool at first sight, but he has just enough\nshrewdness to be an inscrutable old file. He is on picket duty; he\nsees that we are not pestered with hubbub, beginners wanting a job, or\nadvertisements. No other paper has his equal, I think.\"\n\n\"He plays his part well,\" said Lucien; \"I saw him at work.\"\n\nEtienne and Lucien reached a handsome house in the Rue du\nFaubourg-du-Temple.\n\n\"Is M. Braulard in?\" Etienne asked of the porter.\n\n\"_Monsieur_?\" said Lucien. \"Then, is the leader of the _claque_\n'Monsieur'?\"\n\n\"My dear boy, Braulard has twenty thousand francs of income. All the\ndramatic authors of the Boulevards are in his clutches, and have a\nstanding account with him as if he were a banker. Orders and\ncomplimentary tickets are sold here. Braulard knows where to get rid\nof such merchandise. Now for a turn at statistics, a useful science\nenough in its way. At the rate of fifty complimentary tickets every\nevening for each theatre, you have two hundred and fifty tickets\ndaily. Suppose, taking one with another, that they are worth a couple\nof francs apiece, Braulard pays a hundred and twenty-five francs daily\nfor them, and takes his chance of making cent per cent. In this way\nauthors' tickets alone bring him in about four thousand francs every\nmonth, or forty-eight thousand francs per annum. Allow twenty thousand\nfrancs for loss, for he cannot always place all his tickets----\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"Oh! the people who pay at the door go in with the holders of\ncomplimentary tickets for unreserved seats, and the theatre reserves\nthe right of admitting those who pay. There are fine warm evenings to\nbe reckoned with besides, and poor plays. Braulard makes, perhaps,\nthirty thousand francs every year in this way, and he has his\n_claqueurs_ besides, another industry. Florine and Coralie pay tribute\nto him; if they did not, there would be no applause when they come on\nor go off.\"\n\nLousteau gave this explanation in a low voice as they went up the\nstair.\n\n\"Paris is a queer place,\" said Lucien; it seemed to him that he saw\nself-interest squatting in every corner.\n\nA smart maid-servant opened the door. At the sight of Etienne\nLousteau, the dealer in orders and tickets rose from a sturdy chair\nbefore a large cylinder desk, and Lucien beheld the leader of the\n_claque_, Braulard himself, dressed in a gray molleton jacket, footed\ntrousers, and red slippers; for all the world like a doctor or a\nsolicitor. He was a typical self-made man, Lucien thought--a\nvulgar-looking face with a pair of exceedingly cunning gray eyes,\nhands made for hired applause, a complexion over which hard living\nhad passed like rain over a roof, grizzled hair, and a somewhat husky\nvoice.\n\n\"You have come from Mlle. Florine, no doubt, sir, and this gentleman\nfor Mlle. Coralie,\" said Braulard; \"I know you very well by sight.\nDon't trouble yourself, sir,\" he continued, addressing Lucien; \"I am\nbuying the Gymnase connection, I will look after your lady, and I will\ngive her notice of any tricks they may try to play on her.\"\n\n\"That is not an offer to be refused, my dear Braulard, but we have\ncome about the press orders for the Boulevard theatres--I as editor,\nand this gentleman as dramatic critic.\"\n\n\"Oh!--ah, yes! Finot has sold his paper. I heard about it. He is\ngetting on, is Finot. I have asked him to dine with me at the end of\nthe week; if you will do me the honor and pleasure of coming, you may\nbring your ladies, and there will be a grand jollification. Adele\nDupuis is coming, and Ducange, and Frederic du Petit-Mere, and Mlle.\nMillot, my mistress. We shall have good fun and better liquor.\"\n\n\"Ducange must be in difficulties. He has lost his lawsuit.\"\n\n\"I have lent him ten thousand francs; if _Calas_ succeeds, it will repay\nthe loan, so I have been organizing a success. Ducange is a clever\nman; he has brains----\"\n\nLucien fancied that he must be dreaming when he heard a _claqueur_\nappraising a writer's value.\n\n\"Coralie has improved,\" continued Braulard, with the air of a\ncompetent critic. \"If she is a good girl, I will take her part, for\nthey have got up a cabal against her at the Gymnase. This is how I\nmean to do it. I will have a few well-dressed men in the balconies to\nsmile and make a little murmur, and the applause will follow. That is\na dodge which makes a position for an actress. I have a liking for\nCoralie, and you ought to be satisfied, for she has feeling. Aha! I\ncan hiss any one on the stage if I like.\"\n\n\"But let us settle this business about the tickets,\" put in Lousteau.\n\n\"Very well, I will come to this gentleman's lodging for them at the\nbeginning of the month. He is a friend of yours, and I will treat him\nas I do you. You have five theatres; you will get thirty tickets--that\nwill be something like seventy-five francs a month. Perhaps you will\nbe wanting an advance?\" added Braulard, lifting a cash-box full of\ncoin out of his desk.\n\n\"No, no,\" said Lousteau; \"we will keep that shift against a rainy\nday.\"\n\n\"I will work with Coralie, sir, and we will come to an understanding,\"\nsaid Braulard, addressing Lucien, who was looking about him, not\nwithout profound astonishment. There was a bookcase in Braulard's\nstudy, there were framed engravings and good furniture; and as they\npassed through the drawing room, he noticed that the fittings were\nneither too luxurious nor yet mean. The dining-room seemed to be the\nbest ordered room, he remarked on this jokingly.\n\n\"But Braulard is an epicure,\" said Lousteau; \"his dinners are famous\nin dramatic literature, and they are what you might expect from his\ncash-box.\"\n\n\"I have good wine,\" Braulard replied modestly.--\"Ah! here are my\nlamplighters,\" he added, as a sound of hoarse voices and strange\nfootsteps came up from the staircase.\n\nLucien on his way down saw a march past of _claqueurs_ and retailers of\ntickets. It was an ill smelling squad, attired in caps, seedy\ntrousers, and threadbare overcoats; a flock of gallows-birds with\nbluish and greenish tints in their faces, neglected beards, and a\nstrange mixture of savagery and subservience in their eyes. A horrible\npopulation lives and swarms upon the Paris boulevards; selling watch\nguards and brass jewelry in the streets by day, applauding under the\nchandeliers of the theatre at night, and ready to lend themselves to\nany dirty business in the great city.\n\n\"Behold the Romans!\" laughed Lousteau; \"behold fame incarnate for\nactresses and dramatic authors. It is no prettier than our own when\nyou come to look at it close.\"\n\n\"It is difficult to keep illusions on any subject in Paris,\" answered\nLucien as they turned in at his door. \"There is a tax upon everything\n--everything has its price, and anything can be made to order--even\nsuccess.\"\n\nThirty guests were assembled that evening in Coralie's rooms, her\ndining room would not hold more. Lucien had asked Dauriat and the\nmanager of the Panorama-Dramatique, Matifat and Florine, Camusot,\nLousteau, Finot, Nathan, Hector Merlin and Mme. du Val-Noble, Felicien\nVernou, Blondet, Vignon, Philippe Bridau, Mariette, Giroudeau, Cardot\nand Florentine, and Bixiou. He had also asked all his friends of the\nRue des Quatre-Vents. Tullia the dancer, who was not unkind, said\ngossip, to du Bruel, had come without her duke. The proprietors of the\nnewspapers, for whom most of the journalists wrote, were also of the\nparty.\n\nAt eight o'clock, when the lights of the candles in the chandeliers\nshone over the furniture, the hangings, and the flowers, the rooms\nwore the festal air that gives to Parisian luxury the appearance of a\ndream; and Lucien felt indefinable stirrings of hope and gratified\nvanity and pleasure at the thought that he was the master of the\nhouse. But how and by whom the magic wand had been waved he no longer\nsought to remember. Florine and Coralie, dressed with the fanciful\nextravagance and magnificent artistic effect of the stage, smiled on\nthe poet like two fairies at the gates of the Palace of Dreams. And\nLucien was almost in a dream.\n\nHis life had been changed so suddenly during the last few months;  he\nhad gone so swiftly from the depths of penury to the last extreme of\nluxury, that at moments he felt as uncomfortable as a dreaming man who\nknows that he is asleep. And yet, he looked round at the fair reality\nabout him with a confidence to which envious minds might have given\nthe name of fatuity.\n\nLucien himself had changed. He had grown paler during these days of\ncontinual enjoyment; languor had lent a humid look to his eyes; in\nshort, to use Mme. d'Espard's expression, he looked like a man who is\nloved. He was the handsomer for it. Consciousness of his powers and\nhis strength was visible in his face, enlightened as it was by love\nand experience. Looking out over the world of letters and of men, it\nseemed to him that he might go to and fro as lord of it all. Sober\nreflection never entered his romantic head unless it was driven in by\nthe pressure of adversity, and just now the present held not a care\nfor him. The breath of praise swelled the sails of his skiff; all the\ninstruments of success lay there to his hand; he had an establishment,\na mistress whom all Paris envied him, a carriage, and untold wealth in\nhis inkstand. Heart and soul and brain were alike transformed within\nhim; why should he care to be over nice about the means, when the\ngreat results were visibly there before his eyes.\n\nAs such a style of living will seem, and with good reason, to be\nanything but secure to economists who have any experience of Paris, it\nwill not be superfluous to give a glance to the foundation, uncertain\nas it was, upon which the prosperity of the pair was based.\n\nCamusot had given Coralie's tradesmen instructions to grant her credit\nfor three months at least, and this had been done without her\nknowledge. During those three months, therefore, horses and servants,\nlike everything else, waited as if by enchantment at the bidding of\ntwo children, eager for enjoyment, and enjoying to their hearts'\ncontent.\n\nCoralie had taken Lucien's hand and given him a glimpse of the\ntransformation scene in the dining-room, of the splendidly appointed\ntable, of chandeliers, each fitted with forty wax-lights, of the\nroyally luxurious dessert, and a menu of Chevet's. Lucien kissed her\non the forehead and held her closely to his heart.\n\n\"I shall succeed, child,\" he said, \"and then I will repay you for such\nlove and devotion.\"\n\n\"Pshaw!\" said Coralie. \"Are you satisfied?\"\n\n\"I should be very hard to please if I were not.\"\n\n\"Very well, then, that smile of yours pays for everything,\" she said,\nand with a serpentine movement she raised her head and laid her lips\nagainst his.\n\nWhen they went back to the others, Florine, Lousteau, Matifat, and\nCamusot were setting out the card-tables. Lucien's friends began to\narrive, for already these folk began to call themselves \"Lucien's\nfriends\"; and they sat over the cards from nine o'clock till midnight.\nLucien was unacquainted with a single game, but Lousteau lost a\nthousand francs, and Lucien could not refuse to lend him the money\nwhen he asked for it.\n\nMichel, Fulgence, and Joseph appeared about ten o'clock; and Lucien,\nchatting with them in a corner, saw that they looked sober and serious\nenough, not to say ill at ease. D'Arthez could not come, he was\nfinishing his book; Leon Giraud was busy with the first number of his\nreview; so the brotherhood had sent three artists among their number,\nthinking that they would feel less out of their element in an\nuproarious supper party than the rest.\n\n\"Well, my dear fellows,\" said Lucien, assuming a slightly patronizing\ntone, \"the 'comical fellow' may become a great public character yet,\nyou see.\"\n\n\"I wish I may be mistaken; I don't ask better,\" said Michel.\n\n\"Are you living with Coralie until you can do better?\" asked Fulgence.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Lucien, trying to look unconscious. \"Coralie had an\nelderly adorer, a merchant, and she showed him the door, poor fellow.\nI am better off than your brother Philippe,\" he added, addressing\nJoseph Bridau; \"he does not know how to manage Mariette.\"\n\n\"You are a man like another now; in short, you will make your way,\"\nsaid Fulgence.\n\n\"A man that will always be the same for you, under all circumstances,\"\nreturned Lucien.\n\nMichel and Fulgence exchanged incredulous scornful smiles at this.\nLucien saw the absurdity of his remark.\n\n\"Coralie is wonderfully beautiful,\" exclaimed Joseph Bridau. \"What a\nmagnificent portrait she would make!\"\n\n\"Beautiful and good,\" said Lucien; \"she is an angel, upon my word. And\nyou shall paint her portrait; she shall sit to you if you like for\nyour Venetian lady brought by the old woman to the senator.\"\n\n\"All women who love are angelic,\" said Michel Chrestien.\n\nJust at that moment Raoul Nathan flew upon Lucien, and grasped both\nhis hands and shook them in a sudden access of violent friendship.\n\n\"Oh, my good friend, you are something more than a great man, you have\na heart,\" cried he, \"a much rarer thing than genius in these days. You\nare a devoted friend. I am yours, in short, through thick and thin; I\nshall never forget all that you have done for me this week.\"\n\nLucien's joy had reached the highest point; to be thus caressed by a\nman of whom everyone was talking! He looked at his three friends of\nthe brotherhood with something like a superior air. Nathan's\nappearance upon the scene was the result of an overture from Merlin,\nwho sent him a proof of the favorable review to appear in to-morrow's\nissue.\n\n\"I only consented to write the attack on condition that I should be\nallowed to reply to it myself,\" Lucien said in Nathan's ear. \"I am one\nof you.\" This incident was opportune; it justified the remark which\namused Fulgence. Lucien was radiant.\n\n\"When d'Arthez's book comes out,\" he said, turning to the three, \"I am\nin a position to be useful to him. That thought in itself would induce\nme to remain a journalist.\"\n\n\"Can you do as you like?\" Michel asked quickly.\n\n\"So far as one can when one is indispensable,\" said Lucien modestly.\n\nIt was almost midnight when they sat down to supper, and the fun grew\nfast and furious. Talk was less restrained in Lucien's house than at\nMatifat's, for no one suspected that the representatives of the\nbrotherhood and the newspaper writers held divergent opinions. Young\nintellects, depraved by arguing for either side, now came into\nconflict with each other, and fearful axioms of the journalistic\njurisprudence, then in its infancy, hurtled to and fro. Claude Vignon,\nupholding the dignity of criticism, inveighed against the tendency of\nthe smaller newspapers, saying that the writers of personalities\nlowered themselves in the end. Lousteau, Merlin, and Finot took up the\ncudgels for the system known by the name of _blague_; puffery, gossip,\nand humbug, said they, was the test of talent, and set the hall-mark,\nas it were, upon it. \"Any man who can stand that test has real power,\"\nsaid Lousteau.\n\n\"Besides,\" cried Merlin, \"when a great man receives ovations, there\nought to be a chorus in insults to balance, as in a Roman triumph.\"\n\n\"Oho!\" put in Lucien; \"then every one held up to ridicule in print\nwill fancy that he has made a success.\"\n\n\"Any one would think that the question interested you,\" exclaimed\nFinot.\n\n\"And how about our sonnets,\" said Michel Chrestien; \"is that the way\nthey will win us the fame of a second Petrarch?\"\n\n\"Laura already counts for something in his fame,\" said Dauriat, a pun\n[Laure (l'or)] received with acclamations.\n\n\"_Faciamus experimentum in anima vili_,\" retorted Lucien with a smile.\n\n\"And woe unto him whom reviewers shall spare, flinging him crowns at\nhis first appearance, for he shall be shelved like the saints in their\nshrines, and no man shall pay him the slightest attention,\" said\nVernou.\n\n\"People will say, 'Look elsewhere, simpleton; you have had your due\nalready,' as Champcenetz said to the Marquis de Genlis, who was\nlooking too fondly at his wife,\" added Blondet.\n\n\"Success is the ruin of a man in France,\" said Finot. \"We are so\njealous of one another that we try to forget, and to make others\nforget, the triumphs of yesterday.\"\n\n\"Contradiction is the life of literature, in fact,\" said Claude\nVignon.\n\n\"In art as in nature, there are two principles everywhere at strife,\"\nexclaimed Fulgence; \"and victory for either means death.\"\n\n\"So it is with politics,\" added Michel Chrestien.\n\n\"We have a case in point,\" said Lousteau. \"Dauriat will sell a couple\nof thousand copies of Nathan's book in the coming week. And why?\nBecause the book that was cleverly attacked will be ably defended.\"\n\nMerlin took up the proof of to-morrow's paper. \"How can such an\narticle fail to sell an edition?\" he asked.\n\n\"Read the article,\" said Dauriat. \"I am a publisher wherever I am,\neven at supper.\"\n\nMerlin read Lucien's triumphant refutation aloud, and the whole party\napplauded.\n\n\"How could that article have been written unless the attack had\npreceded it?\" asked Lousteau.\n\nDauriat drew the proof of the third article from his pocket and read\nit over, Finot listening closely; for it was to appear in the second\nnumber of his own review, and as editor he exaggerated his enthusiasm.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" said he, \"so and not otherwise would Bossuet have written\nif he had lived in our day.\"\n\n\"I am sure of it,\" said Merlin. \"Bossuet would have been a journalist\nto-day.\"\n\n\"To Bossuet the Second!\" cried Claude Vignon, raising his glass with\nan ironical bow.\n\n\"To my Christopher Columbus!\" returned Lucien, drinking a health to\nDauriat.\n\n\"Bravo!\" cried Nathan.\n\n\"Is it a nickname?\" Merlin inquired, looking maliciously from Finot to\nLucien.\n\n\"If you go on at this pace, you will be quite beyond us,\" said\nDauriat; \"these gentlemen\" (indicating Camusot and Matifat) \"cannot\nfollow you as it is. A joke is like a bit of thread; if it is spun too\nfine, it breaks, as Bonaparte said.\"\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" said Lousteau, \"we have been eye-witnesses of a strange,\nportentous, unheard-of, and truly surprising phenomenon. Admire the\nrapidity with which our friend here has been transformed from a\nprovincial into a journalist!\"\n\n\"He is a born journalist,\" said Dauriat.\n\n\"Children!\" called Finot, rising to his feet, \"all of us here present\nhave encouraged and protected our amphitryon in his entrance upon a\ncareer in which he has already surpassed our hopes. In two months he\nhas shown us what he can do in a series of excellent articles known to\nus all. I propose to baptize him in form as a journalist.\"\n\n\"A crown of roses! to signalize a double conquest,\" cried Bixiou,\nglancing at Coralie.\n\nCoralie made a sign to Berenice. That portly handmaid went to\nCoralie's dressing-room and brought back a box of tumbled artificial\nflowers. The more incapable members of the party were grotesquely\ntricked out in these blossoms, and a crown of roses was soon woven.\nFinot, as high priest, sprinkled a few drops of champagne on Lucien's\ngolden curls, pronouncing with delicious gravity the words--\"In the\nname of the Government Stamp, the Caution-money, and the Fine, I\nbaptize thee, Journalist. May thy articles sit lightly on thee!\"\n\n\"And may they be paid for, including white lines!\" cried Merlin.\n\nJust at that moment Lucien caught sight of three melancholy faces.\nMichel Chrestien, Joseph Bridau, and Fulgence Ridal took up their hats\nand went out amid a storm of invective.\n\n\"Queer customers!\" said Merlin.\n\n\"Fulgence used to be a good fellow,\" added Lousteau, \"before they\nperverted his morals.\"\n\n\"Who are 'they'?\" asked Claude Vignon.\n\n\"Some very serious young men,\" said Blondet, \"who meet at a\nphilosophico-religious symposium in the Rue des Quatre-Vents, and\nworry themselves about the meaning of human life----\"\n\n\"Oh! oh!\"\n\n\"They are trying to find out whether it goes round in a circle, or\nmakes some progress,\" continued Blondet. \"They were very hard put to\nit between the straight line and the curve; the triangle, warranted by\nScripture, seemed to them to be nonsense, when, lo! there arose among\nthem some prophet or other who declared for the spiral.\"\n\n\"Men might meet to invent more dangerous nonsense than that!\"\nexclaimed Lucien, making a faint attempt to champion the brotherhood.\n\n\"You take theories of that sort for idle words,\" said Felicien Vernou;\n\"but a time comes when the arguments take the form of gunshot and the\nguillotine.\"\n\n\"They have not come to that yet,\" said Bixiou; \"they have only come as\nfar as the designs of Providence in the invention of champagne, the\nhumanitarian significance of breeches, and the blind deity who keeps\nthe world going. They pick up fallen great men like Vico, Saint-Simon,\nand Fourier. I am much afraid that they will turn poor Joseph Bridau's\nhead among them.\"\n\n\"Bianchon, my old schoolfellow, gives me the cold shoulder now,\" said\nLousteau; \"it is all their doing----\"\n\n\"Do they give lectures on orthopedy and intellectual gymnastics?\"\nasked Merlin.\n\n\"Very likely,\" answered Finot, \"if Bianchon has any hand in their\ntheories.\"\n\n\"Pshaw!\" said Lousteau; \"he will be a great physician anyhow.\"\n\n\"Isn't d'Arthez their visible head?\" asked Nathan, \"a little youngster\nthat is going to swallow all of us up.\"\n\n\"He is a genius!\" cried Lucien.\n\n\"Genius, is he! Well, give me a glass of sherry!\" said Claude Vignon,\nsmiling.\n\nEvery one, thereupon, began to explain his character for the benefit\nof his neighbor; and when a clever man feels a pressing need of\nexplaining himself, and of unlocking his heart, it is pretty clear\nthat wine has got the upper hand. An hour later, all the men in the\ncompany were the best friends in the world, addressing each other as\ngreat men and bold spirits, who held the future in their hands.\nLucien, in his quality of host, was sufficiently clearheaded to\napprehend the meaning of the sophistries which impressed him and\ncompleted his demoralization.\n\n\"The Liberal party,\" announced Finot, \"is compelled to stir up\ndiscussion somehow. There is no fault to find with the action of the\nGovernment, and you may imagine what a fix the Opposition is in. Which\nof you now cares to write a pamphlet in favor of the system of\nprimogeniture, and raise a cry against the secret designs of the\nCourt? The pamphlet will be paid for handsomely.\"\n\n\"I will write it,\" said Hector Merlin. \"It is my own point of view.\"\n\n\"Your party will complain that you are compromising them,\" said Finot.\n\"Felicien, you must undertake it; Dauriat will bring it out, and we\nwill keep the secret.\"\n\n\"How much shall I get?\"\n\n\"Six hundred francs. Sign it 'Le Comte C, three stars.'\"\n\n\"It's a bargain,\" said Felicien Vernou.\n\n\"So you are introducing the _canard_ to the political world,\" remarked\nLousteau.\n\n\"It is simply the Chabot affair carried into the region of abstract\nideas,\" said Finot. \"Fasten intentions on the Government, and then let\nloose public opinion.\"\n\n\"How a Government can leave the control of ideas to such a pack of\nscamps as we are, is matter for perpetual and profound astonishment to\nme,\" said Claude Vignon.\n\n\"If the Ministry blunders so far as to come down into the arena, we\ncan give them a drubbing. If they are nettled by it, the thing will\nrankle in people's minds, and the Government will lose its hold on the\nmasses. The newspaper risks nothing, and the authorities have\neverything to lose.\"\n\n\"France will be a cipher until newspapers are abolished by law,\" said\nClaude Vignon. \"You are making progress hourly,\" he added, addressing\nFinot. \"You are a modern order of Jesuits, lacking the creed, the\nfixed idea, the discipline, and the union.\"\n\nThey went back to the card-tables; and before long the light of the\ncandles grew feeble in the dawn.\n\n\"Lucien, your friends from the Rue des Quatre-Vents looked as dismal\nas criminals going to be hanged,\" said Coralie.\n\n\"They were the judges, not the criminals,\" replied the poet.\n\n\"Judges are more amusing than _that_,\" said Coralie.\n\n\n\nFor a month Lucien's whole time was taken up with supper parties,\ndinner engagements, breakfasts, and evening parties; he was swept away\nby an irresistible current into a vortex of dissipation and easy work.\nHe no longer thought of the future. The power of calculation amid the\ncomplications of life is the sign of a strong will which poets,\nweaklings, and men who live a purely intellectual life can never\ncounterfeit. Lucien was living from hand to mouth, spending his money\nas fast as he made it, like many another journalist; nor did he give\nso much as a thought to those periodically recurrent days of reckoning\nwhich chequer the life of the bohemian in Paris so sadly.\n\nIn dress and figure he was a rival for the great dandies of the day.\nCoralie, like all zealots, loved to adorn her idol. She ruined herself\nto give her beloved poet the accoutrements which had so stirred his\nenvy in the Garden of the Tuileries. Lucien had wonderful canes, and a\ncharming eyeglass; he had diamond studs, and scarf-rings, and\nsignet-rings, besides an assortment of waistcoats marvelous to behold,\nand in sufficient number to match every color in a variety of costumes.\nHis transition to the estate of dandy swiftly followed. When he went to\nthe German Minister's dinner, all the young men regarded him with\nsuppressed envy; yet de Marsay, Vandenesse, Ajuda-Pinto, Maxime de\nTrailles, Rastignac, Beaudenord, Manerville, and the Duc de\nMaufrigneuse gave place to none in the kingdom of fashion. Men of\nfashion are as jealous among themselves as women, and in the same way.\nLucien was placed between Mme. de Montcornet and Mme. d'Espard, in\nwhose honor the dinner was given; both ladies overwhelmed him with\nflatteries.\n\n\"Why did you turn your back on society when you would have been so\nwell received?\" asked the Marquise. \"Every one was prepared to make\nmuch of you. And I have a quarrel with you too. You owed me a call--I\nam still waiting to receive it. I saw you at the Opera the other day,\nand you would not deign to come to see me nor to take any notice of\nme.\"\n\n\"Your cousin, madame, so unmistakably dismissed me--\"\n\n\"Oh! you do not know women,\" the Marquise d'Espard broke in upon him.\n\"You have wounded the most angelic heart, the noblest nature that I\nknow. You do not know all that Louise was trying to do for you, nor\nhow tactfully she laid her plans for you.--Oh! and she would have\nsucceeded,\" the Marquise continued, replying to Lucien's mute\nincredulity. \"Her husband is dead now; died, as he was bound to die,\nof an indigestion; could you doubt that she would be free sooner or\nlater? And can you suppose that she would like to be Madame Chardon?\nIt was worth while to take some trouble to gain the title of Comtesse\nde Rubempre. Love, you see, is a great vanity, which requires the\nlesser vanities to be in harmony with itself--especially in marriage.\nI might love you to madness--which is to say, sufficiently to marry\nyou--and yet I should find it very unpleasant to be called Madame\nChardon. You can see that. And now that you understand the\ndifficulties of Paris life, you will know how many roundabout ways you\nmust take to reach your end; very well, then, you must admit that\nLouise was aspiring to an all but impossible piece of Court favor; she\nwas quite unknown, she is not rich, and therefore she could not afford\nto neglect any means of success.\n\n\"You are clever,\" the Marquise d'Espard continued; \"but we women, when\nwe love, are cleverer than the cleverest man. My cousin tried to make\nthat absurd Chatelet useful--Oh!\" she broke off, \"I owe not a little\namusement to you; your articles on Chatelet made me laugh heartily.\"\n\nLucien knew not what to think of all this. Of the treachery and bad\nfaith of journalism he had had some experience; but in spite of his\nperspicacity, he scarcely expected to find bad faith or treachery in\nsociety. There were some sharp lessons in store for him.\n\n\"But, madame,\" he objected, for her words aroused a lively curiosity,\n\"is not the Heron under your protection?\"\n\n\"One is obliged to be civil to one's worst enemies in society,\"\nprotested she; \"one may be bored, but one must look as if the talk was\namusing, and not seldom one seems to sacrifice friends the better to\nserve them. Are you still a novice? You mean to write, and yet you\nknow nothing of current deceit? My cousin apparently sacrificed you to\nthe Heron, but how could she dispense with his influence for you? Our\nfriend stands well with the present ministry; and we have made him see\nthat your attacks will do him service--up to a certain point, for we\nwant you to make it up again some of these days. Chatelet has received\ncompensations for his troubles; for, as des Lupeaulx said, 'While the\nnewspapers are making Chatelet ridiculous, they will leave the\nMinistry in peace.'\"\n\nThere was a pause; the Marquise left Lucien to his own reflections.\n\n\"M. Blondet led me to hope that I should have the pleasure of seeing\nyou in my house,\" said the Comtesse de Montcornet. \"You will meet a\nfew artists and men of letters, and some one else who has the keenest\ndesire to become acquainted with you--Mlle. des Touches, the owner of\ntalents rare among our sex. You will go to her house, no doubt. Mlle.\nde Touches (or Camille Maupin, if you prefer it) is prodigiously rich,\nand presides over one of the most remarkable salons in Paris. She has\nheard that you are as handsome as you are clever, and is dying to meet\nyou.\"\n\nLucien could only pour out incoherent thanks and glance enviously at\nEmile Blondet. There was as great a difference between a great lady\nlike Mme. de Montcornet and Coralie as between Coralie and a girl out\nof the streets. The Countess was young and witty and beautiful, with\nthe very white fairness of women of the north. Her mother was the\nPrincess Scherbellof, and the Minister before dinner had paid her the\nmost respectful attention.\n\nBy this time the Marquise had made an end of trifling disdainfully\nwith the wing of a chicken.\n\n\"My poor Louise felt so much affection for you,\" she said. \"She took\nme into her confidence; I knew her dreams of a great career for you.\nShe would have borne a great deal, but what scorn you showed her when\nyou sent back her letters! Cruelty we can forgive; those who hurt us\nmust have still some faith in us; but indifference! Indifference is\nlike polar snows, it extinguishes all life. So, you must see that you\nhave lost a precious affection through your own fault. Why break with\nher? Even if she had scorned you, you had your way to make, had you\nnot?--your name to win back? Louise thought of all that.\"\n\n\"Then why was she silent?\"\n\n\"_Eh! mon Dieu!_\" cried the Marquise, \"it was I myself who advised her\nnot to take you into her confidence. Between ourselves, you know, you\nseemed so little used to the ways of the world, that I took alarm. I\nwas afraid that your inexperience and rash ardor might wreck our\ncarefully-made schemes. Can you recollect yourself as you were then?\nYou must admit that if you could see your double to-day, you would say\nthe same yourself. You are not like the same man. That was our\nmistake. But would one man in a thousand combine such intellectual\ngifts with such wonderful aptitude for taking the tone of society? I\ndid not think that you would be such an astonishing exception. You\nwere transformed so quickly, you acquired the manner of Paris so\neasily, that I did not recognize you in the Bois de Boulogne a month\nago.\"\n\nLucien heard the great lady with inexpressible pleasure; the\nflatteries were spoken with such a petulant, childlike, confiding air,\nand she seemed to take such a deep interest in him, that he thought of\nhis first evening at the Panorama-Dramatique, and began to fancy that\nsome such miracle was about to take place a second time. Everything\nhad smiled upon him since that happy evening; his youth, he thought,\nwas the talisman that worked this change. He would prove this great\nlady; she should not take him unawares.\n\n\"Then, what were these schemes which have turned to chimeras, madame?\"\nasked he.\n\n\"Louise meant to obtain a royal patent permitting you to bear the name\nand title of Rubempre. She wished to put Chardon out of sight. Your\nopinions have put that out of the question now, but _then_ it would not\nhave been so hard to manage, and a title would mean a fortune for you.\n\n\"You will look on these things as trifles and visionary ideas,\" she\ncontinued; \"but we know something of life, and we know, too, all the\nsolid advantages of a Count's title when it is borne by a fashionable\nand extremely charming young man. Announce 'M. Chardon' and 'M. le\nComte de Rubempre' before heiresses or English girls with a million to\ntheir fortune, and note the difference of the effect. The Count might\nbe in debt, but he would find open hearts; his good looks, brought\ninto relief by his title, would be like a diamond in a rich setting;\nM. Chardon would not be so much as noticed. WE have not invented these\nnotions; they are everywhere in the world, even among the burgeois.\nYou are turning your back on fortune at this minute. Do you see that\ngood-looking young man? He is the Vicomte Felix de Vandenesse, one of\nthe King's private secretaries. The King is fond enough of young men\nof talent, and Vandenesse came from the provinces with baggage nearly\nas light as yours. You are a thousand times cleverer than he; but do\nyou belong to a great family, have you a name? You know des Lupeaulx;\nhis name is very much like yours, for he was born a Chardin; well, he\nwould not sell his little farm of Lupeaulx for a million, he will be\nComte des Lupeaulx some day, and perhaps his grandson may be a duke.\n--You have made a false start; and if you continue in that way, it will\nbe all over with you. See how much wiser M. Emile Blondet has been! He\nis engaged on a Government newspaper; he is well looked on by those in\nauthority; he can afford to mix with Liberals, for he holds sound\nopinions; and soon or later he will succeed. But then he understood\nhow to choose his opinions and his protectors.\n\n\"Your charming neighbor\" (Mme. d'Espard glanced at Mme. de Montcornet)\n\"was a Troisville; there are two peers of France in the family and two\ndeputies. She made a wealthy marriage with her name; she sees a great\ndeal of society at her house; she has influence, she will move the\npolitical world for young M. Blondet. Where will a Coralie take you?\nIn a few years' time you will be hopelessly in debt and weary of\npleasure. You have chosen badly in love, and you are arranging your\nlife ill. The woman whom you delight to wound was at the Opera the\nother night, and this was how she spoke of you. She deplored the way\nin which you were throwing away your talent and the prime of youth;\nshe was thinking of you, and not of herself, all the while.\"\n\n\"Ah! if you were only telling me the truth, madame!\" cried Lucien.\n\n\"What object should I have in telling lies?\" returned the Marquise,\nwith a glance of cold disdain which annihilated him. He was so dashed\nby it, that the conversation dropped, for the Marquise was offended,\nand said no more.\n\nLucien was nettled by her silence, but he felt that it was due to his\nown clumsiness, and promised himself that he would repair his error.\nHe turned to Mme. de Montcornet and talked to her of Blondet,\nextolling that young writer for her benefit. The Countess was gracious\nto him, and asked him (at a sign from Mme. d'Espard) to spend an\nevening at her house. It was to be a small and quiet gathering to\nwhich only friends were invited--Mme. de Bargeton would be there in\nspite of her mourning; Lucien would be pleased, she was sure, to meet\nMme. de Bargeton.\n\n\"Mme. la Marquise says that all the wrong is on my side,\" said Lucien;\n\"so surely it rests with her cousin, does it not, to decide whether\nshe will meet me?\"\n\n\"Put an end to those ridiculous attacks, which only couple her name\nwith the name of a man for whom she does not care at all, and you will\nsoon sign a treaty of peace. You thought that she had used you ill, I\nam told, but I myself have seen her in sadness because you had\nforsaken her. Is it true that she left the provinces on your account?\"\n\nLucien smiled; he did not venture to make any other reply.\n\n\"Oh! how could you doubt the woman who made such sacrifices for you?\nBeautiful and intellectual as she is, she deserves besides to be loved\nfor her own sake; and Mme. de Bargeton cared less for you than for\nyour talents. Believe me, women value intellect more than good looks,\"\nadded the Countess, stealing a glance at Emile Blondet.\n\nIn the Minister's hotel Lucien could see the differences between the\ngreat world and that other world beyond the pale in which he had\nlately been living. There was no sort of resemblance between the two\nkinds of splendor, no single point in common. The loftiness and\ndisposition of the rooms in one of the handsomest houses in the\nFaubourg Saint-Germain, the ancient gilding, the breadth of decorative\nstyle, the subdued richness of the accessories, all this was strange\nand new to him; but Lucien had learned very quickly to take luxury for\ngranted, and he showed no surprise. His behavior was as far removed\nfrom assurance or fatuity on the one hand as from complacency and\nservility upon the other. His manner was good; he found favor in the\neyes of all who were not prepared to be hostile, like the younger men,\nwho resented his sudden intrusion into the great world, and felt\njealous of his good looks and his success.\n\nWhen they rose from table, he offered his arm to Mme. d'Espard, and\nwas not refused. Rastignac, watching him, saw that the Marquise was\ngracious to Lucien, and came in the character of a fellow-countryman\nto remind the poet that they had met once before at Mme. du\nVal-Noble's. The young patrician seemed anxious to find an ally in\nthe great man from his own province, asked Lucien to breakfast with\nhim some morning, and offered to introduce him to some young men of\nfashion. Lucien was nothing loath.\n\n\"The dear Blondet is coming,\" said Rastignac.\n\nThe two were standing near the Marquis de Ronquerolles, the Duc de\nRhetore, de Marsay, and General Montriveau. The Minister came across\nto join the group.\n\n\"Well,\" said he, addressing Lucien with a bluff German heartiness that\nconcealed his dangerous subtlety; \"well, so you have made your peace\nwith Mme. d'Espard; she is delighted with you, and we all know,\" he\nadded, looking round the group, \"how difficult it is to please her.\"\n\n\"Yes, but she adores intellect,\" said Rastignac, \"and my illustrious\nfellow-countryman has wit enough to sell.\"\n\n\"He will soon find out that he is not doing well for himself,\" Blondet\nput in briskly. \"He will come over; he will soon be one of us.\"\n\nThose who stood about Lucien rang the changes on this theme; the older\nand responsible men laid down the law with one or two profound\nremarks; the younger ones made merry at the expense of the Liberals.\n\n\"He simply tossed up head or tails for Right or Left, I am sure,\"\nremarked Blondet, \"but now he will choose for himself.\"\n\nLucien burst out laughing; he thought of his talk with Lousteau that\nevening in the Luxembourg Gardens.\n\n\"He has taken on a bear-leader,\" continued Blondet, \"one Etienne\nLousteau, a newspaper hack who sees a five-franc piece in a column.\nLousteau's politics consist in a belief that Napoleon will return, and\n(and this seems to me to be still more simple) in a confidence in the\ngratitude and patriotism of their worships the gentlemen of the Left.\nAs a Rubempre, Lucien's sympathies should lean towards the\naristocracy; as a journalist, he ought to be for authority, or he will\nnever be either Rubempre or a secretary-general.\"\n\nThe Minister now asked Lucien to take a hand at whist; but, to the\ngreat astonishment of those present, he declared that he did not know\nthe game.\n\n\"Come early to me on the day of that breakfast affair,\" Rastignac\nwhispered, \"and I will teach you to play. You are a discredit to the\nroyal city of Angouleme; and, to repeat M. de Talleyrand's saying, you\nare laying up an unhappy old age for yourself.\"\n\nDes Lupeaulx was announced. He remembered Lucien, whom he had met at\nMme. du Val-Noble's, and bowed with a semblance of friendliness which\nthe poet could not doubt. Des Lupeaulx was in favor, he was a Master\nof Requests, and did the Ministry secret services; he was, moreover,\ncunning and ambitious, slipping himself in everywhere; he was\neverybody's friend, for he never knew whom he might need. He saw\nplainly that this was a young journalist whose social success would\nprobably equal his success in literature; saw, too, that the poet was\nambitious, and overwhelmed him with protestations and expressions of\nfriendship and interest, till Lucien felt as if they were old friends\nalready, and took his promises and speeches for more than their worth.\nDes Lupeaulx made a point of knowing a man thoroughly well if he\nwanted to get rid of him or feared him as a rival. So, to all\nappearance, Lucien was well received. He knew that much of his success\nwas owing to the Duc de Rhetore, the Minister, Mme. d'Espard, and Mme.\nde Montcornet, and went to spend a few moments with the two ladies\nbefore taking leave, and talked his very best for them.\n\n\"What a coxcomb!\" said des Lupeaulx, turning to the Marquise when he\nhad gone.\n\n\"He will be rotten before he is ripe,\" de Marsay added, smiling. \"You\nmust have private reasons of your own, madame, for turning his head in\nthis way.\"\n\n\n\nWhen Lucien stepped into the carriage in the courtyard, he found\nCoralie waiting for him. She had come to fetch him. The little\nattention touched him; he told her the history of his evening; and, to\nhis no small astonishment, the new notions which even now were running\nin his head met with Coralie's approval. She strongly advised him to\nenlist under the ministerial banner.\n\n\"You have nothing to expect from the Liberals but hard knocks,\" she\nsaid. \"They plot and conspire; they murdered the Duc de Berri. Will\nthey upset the Government? Never! You will never come to anything\nthrough them, while you will be Comte de Rubempre if you throw in your\nlot with the other side. You might render services to the State, and\nbe a peer of France, and marry an heiress. Be an Ultra. It is the\nproper thing besides,\" she added, this being the last word with her on\nall subjects. \"I dined with the Val-Noble; she told me that Theodore\nGaillard is really going to start his little Royalist _Revue_, so as to\nreply to your witticisms and the jokes in the _Miroir_. To hear them\ntalk, M. Villele's party will be in office before the year is out. Try\nto turn the change to account before they come to power; and say\nnothing to Etienne and your friends, for they are quite equal to\nplaying you some ill turn.\"\n\nA week later, Lucien went to Mme. de Montcornet's house, and saw the\nwoman whom he had so loved, whom later he had stabbed to the heart\nwith a jest. He felt the most violent agitation at the sight of her,\nfor Louise also had undergone a transformation. She was the Louise\nthat she would always have been but for her detention in the provinces\n--she was a great lady. There was a grace and refinement in her\nmourning dress which told that she was a happy widow; Lucien fancied\nthat this coquetry was aimed in some degree at him, and he was right;\nbut, like an ogre, he had tasted flesh, and all that evening he\nvacillated between Coralie's warm, voluptuous beauty and the dried-up,\nhaughty, cruel Louise. He could not make up his mind to sacrifice the\nactress to the great lady; and Mme. de Bargeton--all the old feeling\nreviving in her at the sight of Lucien, Lucien's beauty, Lucien's\ncleverness--was waiting and expecting that sacrifice all evening; and\nafter all her insinuating speeches and her fascinations, she had her\ntrouble for her pains. She left the room with a fixed determination to\nbe revenged.\n\n\"Well, dear Lucien,\" she had said, and in her kindness there was both\ngenerosity and Parisian grace; \"well, dear Lucien, so you, that were\nto have been my pride, took me for your first victim; and I forgave\nyou, my dear, for I felt that in such a revenge there was a trace of\nlove still left.\"\n\nWith that speech, and the queenly way in which it was uttered, Mme. de\nBargeton recovered her position. Lucien, convinced that he was a\nthousand times in the right, felt that he had been put in the wrong.\nNot one word of the causes of the rupture! not one syllable of the\nterrible farewell letter! A woman of the world has a wonderful genius\nfor diminishing her faults by laughing at them; she can obliterate\nthem all with a smile or a question of feigned surprise, and she knows\nthis. She remembers nothing, she can explain everything; she is\namazed, asks questions, comments, amplifies, and quarrels with you,\ntill in the end her sins disappear like stains on the application of a\nlittle soap and water; black as ink you knew them to be; and lo! in a\nmoment, you behold immaculate white innocence, and lucky are you if\nyou do not find that you yourself have sinned in some way beyond\nredemption.\n\nIn a moment old illusions regained their power over Lucien and Louise;\nthey talked like friends, as before; but when the lady, with a\nhesitating sigh, put the question, \"Are you happy?\" Lucien was not\nready with a prompt, decided answer; he was intoxicated with gratified\nvanity; Coralie, who (let us admit it) had made life easy for him, had\nturned his head. A melancholy \"No\" would have made his fortune, but he\nmust needs begin to explain his position with regard to Coralie. He\nsaid that he was loved for his own sake; he said a good many foolish\nthings that a man will say when he is smitten with a tender passion,\nand thought the while that he was doing a clever thing.\n\nMme. de Bargeton bit her lips. There was no more to be said. Mme.\nd'Espard brought Mme. de Montcornet to her cousin, and Lucien became\nthe hero of the evening, so to speak. He was flattered, petted, and\nmade much of by the three women; he was entangled with art which no\nwords can describe. His social success in this fine and brilliant\ncircle was at least as great as his triumphs in journalism. Beautiful\nMlle. des Touches, so well known as \"Camille Maupin,\" asked him to one\nof her Wednesday dinners; his beauty, now so justly famous, seemed to\nhave made an impression upon her. Lucien exerted himself to show that\nhis wit equaled his good looks, and Mlle. des Touches expressed her\nadmiration with a playful outspokenness and a pretty fervor of\nfriendship which deceives those who do not know life in Paris to its\ndepths, nor suspect how continual enjoyment whets the appetite for\nnovelty.\n\n\"If she should like me as much as I like her, we might abridge the\nromance,\" said Lucien, addressing de Marsay and Rastignac.\n\n\"You both of you write romances too well to care to live them,\"\nreturned Rastignac. \"Can men and women who write ever fall in love\nwith each other? A time is sure to come when they begin to make little\ncutting remarks.\"\n\n\"It would not be a bad dream for you,\" laughed de Marsay. \"The\ncharming young lady is thirty years old, it is true, but she has an\nincome of eighty thousand livres. She is adorably capricious, and her\nstyle of beauty wears well. Coralie is a silly little fool, my dear\nboy, well enough for a start, for a young spark must have a mistress;\nbut unless you make some great conquest in the great world, an actress\nwill do you harm in the long run. Now, my boy, go and cut out Conti.\nHere he is, just about to sing with Camille Maupin. Poetry has taken\nprecedence of music ever since time began.\"\n\nBut when Lucien heard Mlle. des Touches' voice blending with Conti's,\nhis hopes fled.\n\n\"Conti sings too well,\" he told des Lupeaulx; and he went back to Mme.\nde Bargeton, who carried him off to Mme. d'Espard in another room.\n\n\"Well, will you not interest yourself in him?\" asked Mme. de Bargeton.\n\nThe Marquise spoke with an air half kindly, half insolent. \"Let M.\nChardon first put himself in such a position that he will not\ncompromise those who take an interest in him,\" she said. \"If he wishes\nto drop his patronymic and to bear his mother's name, he should at any\nrate be on the right side, should he not?\"\n\n\"In less than two months I will arrange everything,\" said Lucien.\n\n\"Very well,\" returned Mme. d'Espard. \"I will speak to my father and\nuncle; they are in waiting, they will speak to the Chancellor for\nyou.\"\n\nThe diplomatist and the two women had very soon discovered Lucien's\nweak side. The poet's head was turned by the glory of the aristocracy;\nevery man who entered the rooms bore a sounding name mounted in a\nglittering title, and he himself was plain Chardon. Unspeakable\nmortification filled him at the sound of it. Wherever he had been\nduring the last few days, that pang had been constantly present with\nhim. He felt, moreover, a sensation quite as unpleasant when he went\nback to his desk after an evening spent in the great world, in which\nhe made a tolerable figure, thanks to Coralie's carriage and Coralie's\nservants.\n\nHe learned to ride, in order to escort Mme. d'Espard, Mlle. des\nTouches, and the Comtesse de Montcornet when they drove in the Bois, a\nprivilege which he had envied other young men so greatly when he first\ncame to Paris. Finot was delighted to give his right-hand man an order\nfor the Opera, so Lucien wasted many an evening there, and\nthenceforward he was among the exquisites of the day.\n\nThe poet asked Rastignac and his new associates to a breakfast, and\nmade the blunder of giving it in Coralie's rooms in the Rue de\nVendome; he was too young, too much of a poet, too self-confident, to\ndiscern certain shades and distinctions in conduct; and how should an\nactress, a good-hearted but uneducated girl, teach him life? His\nguests were anything but charitably disposed towards him; it was\nclearly proven to their minds that Lucien the critic and the actress\nwere in collusion for their mutual interests, and all of the young men\nwere jealous of an arrangement which all of them stigmatized. The most\npitiless of those who laughed that evening at Lucien's expense was\nRastignac himself. Rastignac had made and held his position by very\nsimilar means; but so careful had he been of appearances, that he\ncould afford to treat scandal as slander.\n\nLucien proved an apt pupil at whist. Play became a passion with him;\nand so far from disapproving, Coralie encouraged his extravagance with\nthe peculiar short-sightedness of an all-absorbing love, which sees\nnothing beyond the moment, and is ready to sacrifice anything, even\nthe future, to the present enjoyment. Coralie looked on cards as a\nsafe-guard against rivals. A great love has much in common with\nchildhood--a child's heedless, careless, spendthrift ways, a child's\nlaughter and tears.\n\nIn those days there lived and flourished a set of young men, some of\nthem rich, some poor, and all of them idle, called \"free-livers\"\n(_viveurs_); and, indeed, they lived with incredible insolence\n--unabashed and unproductive consumers, and yet more intrepid\ndrinkers. These spendthrifts mingled the roughest practical jokes with\na life not so much reckless as suicidal; they drew back from no\nimpossibility, and gloried in pranks which, nevertheless, were\nconfined within certain limits; and as they showed the most original\nwit in their escapades, it was impossible not to pardon them.\n\nNo sign of the times more plainly discovered the helotism to which the\nRestoration had condemned the young manhood of the epoch. The younger\nmen, being at a loss to know what to do with themselves, were\ncompelled to find other outlets for their superabundant energy besides\njournalism, or conspiracy, or art, or letters. They squandered their\nstrength in the wildest excesses, such sap and luxuriant power was\nthere in young France. The hard workers among these gilded youths\nwanted power and pleasure; the artists wished for money; the idle\nsought to stimulate their appetites or wished for excitement; one and\nall of them wanted a place, and one and all were shut out from\npolitics and public life. Nearly all the \"free-livers\" were men of\nunusual mental powers; some held out against the enervating life,\nothers were ruined by it. The most celebrated and the cleverest among\nthem was Eugene Rastignac, who entered, with de Marsay's help, upon a\npolitical career, in which he has since distinguished himself. The\npractical jokes, in which the set indulged became so famous, that not\na few vaudevilles have been founded upon them.\n\nBlondet introduced Lucien to this society of prodigals, of which he\nbecame a brilliant ornament, ranking next to Bixiou, one of the most\nmischievous and untiring scoffing wits of his time. All through that\nwinter Lucien's life was one long fit of intoxication, with intervals\nof easy work. He continued his series of sketches of contemporary\nlife, and very occasionally made great efforts to write a few pages of\nserious criticism, on which he brought his utmost power of thought to\nbear. But study was the exception, not the rule, and only undertaken\nat the bidding of necessity; dinners and breakfasts, parties of\npleasure and play, took up most of his time, and Coralie absorbed all\nthat was left. He would not think of the morrow. He saw besides that\nhis so-called friends were leading the same life, earning money easily\nby writing publishers' prospectuses and articles paid for by\nspeculators; all of them lived beyond their incomes, none of them\nthought seriously of the future.\n\nLucien had been admitted into the ranks of journalism and of\nliterature on terms of equality; he foresaw immense difficulties in\nthe way if he should try to rise above the rest. Every one was willing\nto look upon him as an equal; no one would have him for a superior.\nUnconsciously he gave up the idea of winning fame in literature, for\nit seemed easier to gain success in politics.\n\n\"Intrigue raises less opposition than talent,\" du Chatelet had said\none day (for Lucien and the Baron had made up their quarrel); \"a plot\nbelow the surface rouses no one's attention. Intrigue, moreover, is\nsuperior to talent, for it makes something out of nothing; while, for\nthe most part, the immense resources of talent only injure a man.\"\n\nSo Lucien never lost sight of his principal idea; and though\nto-morrow, following close upon the heels of to-day in the midst of an\norgy, never found the promised work accomplished, Lucien was assiduous\nin society. He paid court to Mme. de Bargeton, the Marquise d'Espard,\nand the Comtesse de Montcornet; he never missed a single party given\nby Mlle. des Touches, appearing in society after a dinner given by\nauthors or publishers, and leaving the salons for a supper given in\nconsequence of a bet. The demands of conversation and the excitement\nof play absorbed all the ideas and energy left by excess. The poet had\nlost the lucidity of judgment and coolness of head which must be\npreserved if a man is to see all that is going on around him, and\nnever to lose the exquisite tact which the _parvenu_ needs at every\nmoment. How should he know how many a time Mme. de Bargeton left him\nwith wounded susceptibilities, how often she forgave him or added one\nmore condemnation to the rest?\n\nChatelet saw that his rival had still a chance left, so he became\nLucien's friend. He encouraged the poet in dissipation that wasted his\nenergies. Rastignac, jealous of his fellow-countryman, and thinking,\nbesides, that Chatelet would be a surer and more useful ally than\nLucien, had taken up the Baron's cause. So, some few days after the\nmeeting of the Petrarch and Laura of Angouleme, Rastignac brought\nabout the reconciliation between the poet and the elderly beau at a\nsumptuous supper given at the _Rocher de Cancale_. Lucien never returned\nhome till morning, and rose in the middle of the day; Coralie was\nalways at his side, he could not forego a single pleasure. Sometimes\nhe saw his real position, and made good resolutions, but they came to\nnothing in his idle, easy life; and the mainspring of will grew slack,\nand only responded to the heaviest pressure of necessity.\n\nCoralie had been glad that Lucien should amuse himself; she had\nencouraged him in this reckless expenditure, because she thought that\nthe cravings which she fostered would bind her lover to her. But\ntender-hearted and loving as she was, she found courage to advise\nLucien not to forget his work, and once or twice was obliged to remind\nhim that he had earned very little during the month. Their debts were\ngrowing frightfully fast. The fifteen hundred francs which remained\nfrom the purchase-money of the _Marguerites_ had been swallowed up at\nonce, together with Lucien's first five hundred livres. In three\nmonths he had only made a thousand francs, yet he felt as though he\nhad been working tremendously hard. But by this time Lucien had\nadopted the \"free-livers\" pleasant theory of debts.\n\nDebts are becoming to a young man, but after the age of\nfive-and-twenty they are inexcusable. It should be observed that there\nare certain natures in which a really poetic temper is united with a\nweakened will; and these while absorbed in feeling, that they may\ntransmute personal experience, sensation, or impression into some\npermanent form are essentially deficient in the moral sense which\nshould accompany all observation. Poets prefer rather to receive their\nown impressions than to enter into the souls of others to study the\nmechanism of their feelings and thoughts. So Lucien neither asked his\nassociates what became of those who disappeared from among them, nor\nlooked into the futures of his so-called friends. Some of them were\nheirs to property, others had definite expectations; yet others either\npossessed names that were known in the world, or a most robust belief\nin their destiny and a fixed resolution to circumvent the law. Lucien,\ntoo, believed in his future on the strength of various profound\naxiomatic sayings of Blondet's: \"Everything comes out all right at\nlast--If a man has nothing, his affairs cannot be embarrassed--We have\nnothing to lose but the fortune that we seek--Swim with the stream; it\nwill take you somewhere--A clever man with a footing in society can\nmake a fortune whenever he pleases.\"\n\nThat winter, filled as it was with so many pleasures and dissipations,\nwas a necessary interval employed in finding capital for the new\nRoyalist paper; Theodore Gaillard and Hector Merlin only brought out\nthe first number of the _Reveil_ in March 1822. The affair had been\nsettled at Mme. du Val-Noble's house. Mme. du val-Noble exercised a\ncertain influence over the great personages, Royalist writers, and\nbankers who met in her splendid rooms--\"fit for a tale out of the\n_Arabian Nights_,\" as the elegant and clever courtesan herself used to\nsay--to transact business which could not be arranged elsewhere. The\neditorship had been promised to Hector Merlin. Lucien, Merlin's\nintimate, was pretty certain to be his right-hand man, and a\n_feuilleton_ in a Ministerial paper had been promised to him besides.\nAll through the dissipations of that winter Lucien had been secretly\nmaking ready for this change of front. Child as he was, he fancied\nthat he was a deep politician because he concealed the preparation for\nthe approaching transformation-scene, while he was counting upon\nMinisterial largesses to extricate himself from embarrassment and to\nlighten Coralie's secret cares. Coralie said nothing of her distress;\nshe smiled now, as always; but Berenice was bolder, she kept Lucien\ninformed of their difficulties; and the budding great man, moved,\nafter the fashion of poets, by the tale of disasters, would vow that\nhe would begin to work in earnest, and then forget his resolution, and\ndrown his fleeting cares in excess. One day Coralie saw the poetic\nbrow overcast, and scolded Berenice, and told her lover that\neverything would be settled.\n\nMme. d'Espard and Mme. de Bargeton were waiting for Lucien's\nprofession of his new creed, so they said, before applying through\nChatelet for the patent which should permit Lucien to bear the so-much\ndesired name. Lucien had proposed to dedicate the _Marguerites_ to Mme.\nd'Espard, and the Marquise seemed to be not a little flattered by a\ncompliment which authors have been somewhat chary of paying since they\nbecame a power in the land; but when Lucien went to Dauriat and asked\nafter his book, that worthy publisher met him with excellent reasons\nfor the delay in its appearance. Dauriat had this and that in hand,\nwhich took up all his time; a new volume by Canalis was coming out,\nand he did not want the two books to clash; M. de Lamartine's second\nseries of _Meditations_ was in the press, and two important collections\nof poetry ought not to appear together.\n\nBy this time, however, Lucien's needs were so pressing that he had\nrecourse to Finot, and received an advance on his work. When, at a\nsupper-party that evening, the poet journalist explained his position\nto his friends in the fast set, they drowned his scruples in\nchampagne, iced with pleasantries. Debts! There was never yet a man of\nany power without debts! Debts represented satisfied cravings,\nclamorous vices. A man only succeeds under the pressure of the iron\nhand of necessity. Debts forsooth!\n\n\"Why, the one pledge of which a great man can be sure, is given him by\nhis friend the pawnbroker,\" cried Blondet.\n\n\"If you want everything, you must owe for everything,\" called Bixiou.\n\n\"No,\" corrected des Lupeaulx, \"if you owe for everything, you have had\neverything.\"\n\nThe party contrived to convince the novice that his debts were a\ngolden spur to urge on the horses of the chariot of his fortunes.\nThere is always the stock example of Julius Caesar with his debt of\nforty millions, and Friedrich II. on an allowance of one ducat a\nmonth, and a host of other great men whose failings are held up for\nthe corruption of youth, while not a word is said of their\nwide-reaching ideas, their courage equal to all odds.\n\nCreditors seized Coralie's horses, carriage, and furniture at last,\nfor an amount of four thousand francs. Lucien went to Lousteau and\nasked his friend to meet his bill for the thousand francs lent to pay\ngaming debts; but Lousteau showed him certain pieces of stamped paper,\nwhich proved that Florine was in much the same case. Lousteau was\ngrateful, however, and offered to take the necessary steps for the\nsale of Lucien's _Archer of Charles IX._\n\n\"How came Florine to be in this plight?\" asked Lucien.\n\n\"The Matifat took alarm,\" said Lousteau. \"We have lost him; but if\nFlorine chooses, she can make him pay dear for his treachery. I will\ntell you all about it.\"\n\nThree days after this bootless errand, Lucien and Coralie were\nbreakfasting in melancholy spirits beside the fire in their pretty\nbedroom. Berenice had cooked a dish of eggs for them over the grate;\nfor the cook had gone, and the coachman and servants had taken leave.\nThey could not sell the furniture, for it had been attached; there was\nnot a single object of any value in the house. A goodly collection of\npawntickets, forming a very instructive octavo volume, represented all\nthe gold, silver, and jewelry. Berenice had kept back a couple of\nspoons and forks, that was all.\n\nLousteau's newspaper was of service now to Coralie and Lucien, little\nas they suspected it; for the tailor, dressmaker, and milliner were\nafraid to meddle with a journalist who was quite capable of writing\ndown their establishments.\n\nEtienne Lousteau broke in upon their breakfast with a shout of\n\"Hurrah! Long live _The Archer of Charles IX._! And I have converted a\nhundred francs worth of books into cash, children. We will go halves.\"\n\nHe handed fifty francs to Coralie, and sent Berenice out in quest of a\nmore substantial breakfast.\n\n\"Hector Merlin and I went to a booksellers' trade dinner yesterday,\nand prepared the way for your romance with cunning insinuations.\nDauriat is in treaty, but Dauriat is haggling over it; he won't give\nmore than four thousand francs for two thousand copies, and you want\nsix thousand francs. We made you out twice as great as Sir Walter\nScott! Oh! you have such novels as never were in the inwards of you.\nIt is not a mere book for sale, it is a big business; you are not\nsimply the writer of one more or less ingenious novel, you are going\nto write a whole series. The word 'series' did it! So, mind you, don't\nforget that you have a great historical series on hand--_La Grande\nMademoiselle_, or _The France of Louis Quatorze_; _Cotillon I._, or _The\nEarly Days of Louis Quinze_; _The Queen and the Cardinal_, or _Paris and\nthe Fronde_; _The Son of the Concini_, or _Richelieu's Intrigue_. These\nnovels will be announced on the wrapper of the book. We call this\nmanoeuvre 'giving a success a toss in the coverlet,' for the titles\nare all to appear on the cover, till you will be better known for the\nbooks that you have not written than for the work you have done. And\n'In the Press' is a way of gaining credit in advance for work that you\nwill do. Come, now, let us have a little fun! Here comes the\nchampagne. You can understand, Lucien, that our men opened eyes as big\nas saucers. By the by, I see that you have saucers still left.\"\n\n\"They are attached,\" explained Coralie.\n\n\"I understand, and I resume. Show a publisher one manuscript volume\nand he will believe in all the rest. A publisher asks to see your\nmanuscript, and gives you to understand that he is going to read it.\nWhy disturb his harmless vanity? They never read a manuscript; they\nwould not publish so many if they did. Well, Hector and I allowed it\nto leak out that you might consider an offer of five thousand francs\nfor three thousand copies, in two editions. Let me have your _Archer_;\nthe day after to-morrow we are to breakfast with the publishers, and\nwe will get the upper hand of them.\"\n\n\"Who are they?\" asked Lucien.\n\n\"Two partners named Fendant and Cavalier; they are two good fellows,\npretty straightforward in business. One of them used to be with Vidal\nand Porchon, the other is the cleverest hand on the Quai des\nAugustins. They only started in business last year, and have lost a\nlittle on translations of English novels; so now my gentlemen have a\nmind to exploit the native product. There is a rumor current that\nthose dealers in spoiled white paper are trading on other people's\ncapital; but I don't think it matters very much to you who finds the\nmoney, so long as you are paid.\"\n\nTwo days later, the pair went to a breakfast in the Rue Serpente, in\nLucien's old quarter of Paris. Lousteau still kept his room in the Rue\nde la Harpe; and it was in the same state as before, but this time\nLucien felt no surprise; he had been initiated into the life of\njournalism; he knew all its ups and downs. Since that evening of his\nintroduction to the Wooden Galleries, he had been paid for many an\narticle, and gambled away the money along with the desire to write. He\nhad filled columns, not once but many times, in the ingenious ways\ndescribed by Lousteau on that memorable evening as they went to the\nPalais Royal. He was dependent upon Barbet and Braulard; he trafficked\nin books and theatre-tickets; he shrank no longer from any attack,\nfrom writing any panegyric; and at this moment he was in some sort\nrejoicing to make all he could out of Lousteau before turning his back\non the Liberals. His intimate knowledge of the party would stand him\nin good stead in future. And Lousteau, on his side, was privately\nreceiving five hundred francs of purchase-money, under the name of\ncommission, from Fendant and Cavalier for introducing the future Sir\nWalter Scott to two enterprising tradesmen in search of a French\nAuthor of \"Waverley.\"\n\nThe firm of Fendant and Cavalier had started in business without any\ncapital whatsoever. A great many publishing houses were established at\nthat time in the same way, and are likely to be established so long as\npapermakers and printers will give credit for the time required to\nplay some seven or eight of the games of chance called \"new\npublications.\" At that time, as at present, the author's copyright was\npaid for in bills at six, nine, and twelve months--a method of payment\ndetermined by the custom of the trade, for booksellers settle accounts\nbetween themselves by bills at even longer dates. Papermakers and\nprinters are paid in the same way, so that in practice the\npublisher-bookseller has a dozen or a score of works on sale for a\ntwelvemonth before he pays for them. Even if only two or three of these\nhit the public taste, the profitable speculations pay for the bad, and\nthe publisher pays his way by grafting, as it were, one book upon\nanother. But if all of them turn out badly; or if, for his misfortune,\nthe publisher-bookseller happens to bring out some really good literature\nwhich stays on hand until the right public discovers and appreciates\nit; or if it costs too much to discount the paper that he receives,\nthen, resignedly, he files his schedule, and becomes a bankrupt with\nan untroubled mind. He was prepared all along for something of the\nkind. So, all the chances being in favor of the publishers, they\nstaked other people's money, not their own upon the gaming-table of\nbusiness speculation.\n\nThis was the case with Fendant and Cavalier. Cavalier brought his\nexperience, Fendant his industry; the capital was a joint-stock\naffair, and very accurately described by that word, for it consisted\nin a few thousand francs scraped together with difficulty by the\nmistresses of the pair. Out of this fund they allowed each other a\nfairly handsome salary, and scrupulously spent it all in dinners to\njournalists and authors, or at the theatre, where their business was\ntransacted, as they said. This questionably honest couple were both\nsupposed to be clever men of business, but Fendant was more slippery\nthan Cavalier. Cavalier, true to his name, traveled about, Fendant\nlooked after business in Paris. A partnership between two publishers\nis always more or less of a duel, and so it was with Fendant and\nCavalier.\n\nThey had brought out plenty of romances already, such as the _Tour du\nNord_, _Le Marchand de Benares_, _La Fontaine du Sepulcre_, and _Tekeli_,\ntranslations of the works of Galt, an English novelist who never\nattained much popularity in France. The success of translations of\nScott had called the attention of the trade to English novels. The\nrace of publishers, all agog for a second Norman conquest, were\nseeking industriously for a second Scott, just as at a rather later\nday every one must needs look for asphalt in stony soil, or bitumen in\nmarshes, and speculate in projected railways. The stupidity of the\nParis commercial world is conspicuous in these attempts to do the same\nthing twice, for success lies in contraries; and in Paris, of all\nplaces in the world, success spoils success. So beneath the title of\n_Strelitz, or Russia a Hundred Years Ago_, Fendant and Cavalier rashly\nadded in big letters the words, \"In the style of Scott.\"\n\nFendant and Cavalier were in great need of a success. A single good\nbook might float their sunken bales, they thought; and there was the\nalluring prospect besides of articles in the newspapers, the great way\nof promoting sales in those days. A book is very seldom bought and\nsold for its just value, and purchases are determined by\nconsiderations quite other than the merits of the work. So Fendant and\nCavalier thought of Lucien as a journalist, and of his book as a\nsalable article, which would help them to tide over their monthly\nsettlement.\n\nThe partners occupied the ground floor of one of the great\nold-fashioned houses in the Rue Serpente; their private office had\nbeen contrived at the further end of a suite of large drawing-rooms,\nnow converted into warehouses for books. Lucien and Etienne found the\npublishers in their office, the agreement drawn up, and the bills\nready. Lucien wondered at such prompt action.\n\nFendant was short and thin, and by no means reassuring of aspect. With\nhis low, narrow forehead, sunken nose, and hard mouth, he looked like\na Kalmuck Tartar; a pair of small, wide-awake black eyes, the crabbed\nirregular outline of his countenance, a voice like a cracked bell--the\nman's whole appearance, in fact, combined to give the impression that\nthis was a consummate rascal. A honeyed tongue compensated for these\ndisadvantages, and he gained his ends by talk. Cavalier, a stout,\nthick-set young fellow, looked more like the driver of a mail coach\nthan a publisher; he had hair of a sandy color, a fiery red\ncountenance, and the heavy build and untiring tongue of a commercial\ntraveler.\n\n\"There is no need to discuss this affair,\" said Fendant, addressing\nLucien and Lousteau. \"I have read the work, it is very literary, and\nso exactly the kind of thing we want, that I have sent it off as it is\nto the printer. The agreement is drawn on the lines laid down, and\nbesides, we always make the same stipulations in all cases. The bills\nfall due in six, nine, and twelve months respectively; you will meet\nwith no difficulty in discounting them, and we will refund you the\ndiscount. We have reserved the right of giving a new title to the\nbook. We don't care for _The Archer of Charles IX._; it doesn't tickle\nthe reader's curiosity sufficiently; there were several kings of that\nname, you see, and there were so many archers in the Middle Ages. If\nyou had only called it the _Soldier of Napoleon_, now! But _The Archer\nof Charles IX._!--why, Cavalier would have to give a course of history\nlessons before he could place a copy anywhere in the provinces.\"\n\n\"If you but knew the class of people that we have to do with!\"\nexclaimed Cavalier.\n\n\"_Saint Bartholomew_ would suit better,\" continued Fendant.\n\n\"_Catherine de' Medici, or France under Charles IX._, would sound more\nlike one of Scott's novels,\" added Cavalier.\n\n\"We will settle it when the work is printed,\" said Fendant.\n\n\"Do as you please, so long as I approve your title,\" said Lucien.\n\nThe agreement was read over, signed in duplicate, and each of the\ncontracting parties took their copy. Lucien put the bills in his\npocket with unequaled satisfaction, and the four repaired to Fendant's\nabode, where they breakfasted on beefsteaks and oysters, kidneys in\nchampagne, and Brie cheese; but if the fare was something of the\nhomeliest, the wines were exquisite; Cavalier had an acquaintance a\ntraveler in the wine trade. Just as they sat down to table the printer\nappeared, to Lucien's surprise, with the first two proof-sheets.\n\n\"We want to get on with it,\" Fendant said; \"we are counting on your\nbook; we want a success confoundedly badly.\"\n\nThe breakfast, begun at noon, lasted till five o'clock.\n\n\"Where shall we get cash for these things?\" asked Lucien as they came\naway, somewhat heated and flushed with the wine.\n\n\"We might try Barbet,\" suggested Etienne, and they turned down to the\nQuai des Augustins.\n\n\"Coralie is astonished to the highest degree over Florine's loss.\nFlorine only told her about it yesterday; she seemed to lay the blame\nof it on you, and was so vexed, that she was ready to throw you over.\"\n\n\"That's true,\" said Lousteau. Wine had got the better of prudence, and\nhe unbosomed himself to Lucien, ending up with: \"My friend--for you\nare my friend, Lucien; you lent me a thousand francs, and you have\nonly once asked me for the money--shun play! If I had never touched a\ncard, I should be a happy man. I owe money all round. At this moment I\nhave the bailiffs at my heels; indeed, when I go to the Palais Royal,\nI have dangerous capes to double.\"\n\nIn the language of the fast set, doubling a cape meant dodging a\ncreditor, or keeping out of his way. Lucien had not heard the\nexpression before, but he was familiar with the practice by this time.\n\n\"Are your debts so heavy?\"\n\n\"A mere trifle,\" said Lousteau. \"A thousand crowns would pull me\nthrough. I have resolved to turn steady and give up play, and I have\ndone a little 'chantage' to pay my debts.\"\n\n\"What is 'chantage'?\" asked Lucien.\n\n\"It is an English invention recently imported. A 'chanteur' is a man\nwho can manage to put a paragraph in the papers--never an editor nor a\nresponsible man, for they are not supposed to know anything about it,\nand there is always a Giroudeau or a Philippe Bridau to be found. A\nbravo of this stamp finds up somebody who has his own reasons for not\nwanting to be talked about. Plenty of people have a few peccadilloes,\nor some more or less original sin, upon their consciences; there are\nplenty of fortunes made in ways that would not bear looking into;\nsometimes a man has kept the letter of the law, and sometimes he has\nnot; and in either case, there is a tidbit of tattle for the inquirer,\nas, for instance, that tale of Fouche's police surrounding the spies\nof the Prefect of Police, who, not being in the secret of the\nfabrication of forged English banknotes, were just about to pounce on\nthe clandestine printers employed by the Minister, or there is the\nstory of Prince Galathionne's diamonds, the Maubreuile affair, or the\nPombreton will case. The 'chanteur' gets possession of some\ncompromising letter, asks for an interview; and if the man that made\nthe money does not buy silence, the 'chanteur' draws a picture of the\npress ready to take the matter up and unravel his private affairs. The\nrich man is frightened, he comes down with the money, and the trick\nsucceeds.\n\n\"You are committed to some risky venture, which might easily be\nwritten down in a series of articles; a 'chanteur' waits upon you, and\noffers to withdraw the articles--for a consideration. 'Chanteurs' are\nsent to men in office, who will bargain that their acts and not their\nprivate characters are to be attacked, or they are heedless of their\ncharacters, and anxious only to shield the woman they love. One of\nyour acquaintance, that charming Master of Requests des Lupeaulx, is a\nkind of agent for affairs of this sort. The rascal has made a position\nfor himself in the most marvelous way in the very centre of power; he\nis the middle-man of the press and the ambassador of the Ministers; he\nworks upon a man's self-love; he bribes newspapers to pass over a loan\nin silence, or to make no comment on a contract which was never put up\nfor public tender, and the jackals of Liberal bankers get a share out\nof it. That was a bit of 'chantage' that you did with Dauriat; he gave\nyou a thousand crowns to let Nathan alone. In the eighteenth century,\nwhen journalism was still in its infancy, this kind of blackmail was\nlevied by pamphleteers in the pay of favorites and great lords. The\noriginal inventor was Pietro Aretino, a great Italian. Kings went in\nfear of him, as stage-players go in fear of a newspaper to-day.\"\n\n\"What did you do to the Matifat to make the thousand crowns?\"\n\n\"I attacked Florine in half a dozen papers. Florine complained to\nMatifat. Matifat went to Braulard to find out what the attacks meant.\nI did my 'chantage' for Finot's benefit, and Finot put Braulard on the\nwrong scent; Braulard told the man of drugs that _you_ were demolishing\nFlorine in Coralie's interest. Then Giroudeau went round to Matifat\nand told him (in confidence) that the whole business could be\naccommodated if he (Matifat) would consent to sell his sixth share in\nFinot's review for ten thousand francs. Finot was to give me a\nthousand crowns if the dodge succeeded. Well, Matifat was only too\nglad to get back ten thousand francs out of the thirty thousand\ninvested in a risky speculation, as he thought, for Florine had been\ntelling him for several days past that Finot's review was doing badly;\nand, instead of paying a dividend, something was said of calling up\nmore capital. So Matifat was just about to close with the offer, when\nthe manager of the Panorama-Dramatique comes to him with some\naccommodation bills that he wanted to negotiate before filing his\nschedule. To induce Matifat to take them of him, he let out a word of\nFinot's trick. Matifat, being a shrewd man of business, took the hint,\nheld tight to his sixth, and is laughing in his sleeve at us. Finot\nand I are howling with despair. We have been so misguided as to attack\na man who has no affection for his mistress, a heartless, soulless\nwretch. Unluckily, too, for us, Matifat's business is not amenable to\nthe jurisdiction of the press, and he cannot be made to smart for it\nthrough his interests. A druggist is not like a hatter or a milliner,\nor a theatre or a work of art; he is above criticism; you can't run\ndown his opium and dyewoods, nor cocoa beans, paint, and pepper.\nFlorine is at her wits' end; the Panorama closes to-morrow, and what\nwill become of her she does not know.\"\n\n\"Coralie's engagement at the Gymnase begins in a few days,\" said\nLucien; \"she might do something for Florine.\"\n\n\"Not she!\" said Lousteau. \"Coralie is not clever, but she is not quite\nsimple enough to help herself to a rival. We are in a mess with a\nvengeance. And Finot is in such a hurry to buy back his sixth----\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"It is a capital bit of business, my dear fellow. There is a chance of\nselling the paper for three hundred thousand francs; Finot would have\none-third, and his partners besides are going to pay him a commission,\nwhich he will share with des Lupeaulx. So I propose to do another turn\nof 'chantage.'\"\n\n\"'Chantage' seems to mean your money or your life?\"\n\n\"It is better than that,\" said Lousteau; \"it is your money or your\ncharacter. A short time ago the proprietor of a minor newspaper was\nrefused credit. The day before yesterday it was announced in his\ncolumns that a gold repeater set with diamonds belonging to a certain\nnotability had found its way in a curious fashion into the hands of a\nprivate soldier in the Guards; the story promised to the readers might\nhave come from the _Arabian Nights_. The notability lost no time in\nasking that editor to dine with him; the editor was distinctly a\ngainer by the transaction, and contemporary history has lost an\nanecdote. Whenever the press makes vehement onslaughts upon some one\nin power, you may be sure that there is some refusal to do a service\nbehind it. Blackmailing with regard to private life is the terror of\nthe richest Englishman, and a great source of wealth to the press in\nEngland, which is infinitely more corrupt than ours. We are children\nin comparison! In England they will pay five or six thousand francs\nfor a compromising letter to sell again.\"\n\n\"Then how can you lay hold of Matifat?\" asked Lucien.\n\n\"My dear boy, that low tradesman wrote the queerest letters to\nFlorine; the spelling, style, and matter of them is ludicrous to the\nlast degree. We can strike him in the very midst of his Lares and\nPenates, where he feels himself safest, without so much as mentioning\nhis name; and he cannot complain, for he lives in fear and terror of\nhis wife. Imagine his wrath when he sees the first number of a little\nserial entitled the _Amours of a Druggist_, and is given fair warning\nthat his love-letters have fallen into the hands of certain\njournalists. He talks about the 'little god Cupid,' he tells Florine\nthat she enables him to cross the desert of life (which looks as if he\ntook her for a camel), and spells 'never' with two v's. There is\nenough in that immensely funny correspondence to bring an influx of\nsubscribers for a fortnight. He will shake in his shoes lest an\nanonymous letter should supply his wife with the key to the riddle.\nThe question is whether Florine will consent to appear to persecute\nMatifat. She has some principles, which is to say, some hopes, still\nleft. Perhaps she means to keep the letters and make something for\nherself out of them. She is cunning, as befits my pupil. But as soon\nas she finds out that a bailiff is no laughing matter, or Finot gives\nher a suitable present or hopes of an engagement, she will give me the\nletters, and I will sell them to Finot. Finot will put the\ncorrespondence in his uncle's hands, and Giroudeau will bring Matifat\nto terms.\"\n\nThese confidences sobered Lucien. His first thought was that he had\nsome extremely dangerous friends; his second, that it would be\nimpolitic to break with them; for if Mme. d'Espard, Mme. de Bargeton,\nand Chatelet should fail to keep their word with him, he might need\ntheir terrible power yet. By this time Etienne and Lucien had reached\nBarbet's miserable bookshop on the Quai. Etienne addressed Barbet:\n\n\"We have five thousand francs' worth of bills at six, nine, and twelve\nmonths, given by Fendant and Cavalier. Are you willing to discount\nthem for us?\"\n\n\"I will give you three thousand francs for them,\" said Barbet with\nimperturbable coolness.\n\n\"Three thousand francs!\" echoed Lucien.\n\n\"Nobody else will give you as much,\" rejoined the bookseller. \"The\nfirm will go bankrupt before three months are out; but I happen to\nknow that they have some good books that are hanging on hand; they\ncannot afford to wait, so I shall buy their stock for cash and pay\nthem with their own bills, and get the books at a reduction of two\nthousand francs. That's how it is.\"\n\n\"Do you mind losing a couple of thousand francs, Lucien?\" asked\nLousteau.\n\n\"Yes!\" Lucien answered vehemently. He was dismayed by this first\nrebuff.\n\n\"You are making a mistake,\" said Etienne.\n\n\"You won't find any one that will take their paper,\" said Barbet.\n\"Your book is their last stake, sir. The printer will not trust them;\nthey are obliged to leave the copies in pawn with him. If they make a\nhit now, it will only stave off bankruptcy for another six months,\nsooner or later they will have to go. They are cleverer at tippling\nthan at bookselling. In my own case, their bills mean business; and\nthat being so, I can afford to give more than a professional\ndiscounter who simply looks at the signatures. It is a\nbill-discounter's business to know whether the three names on a bill\nare each good for thirty per cent in case of bankruptcy. And here at\nthe outset you only offer two signatures, and neither of them worth\nten per cent.\"\n\nThe two journalists exchanged glances in surprise. Here was a little\nscrub of a bookseller putting the essence of the art and mystery of\nbill-discounting in these few words.\n\n\"That will do, Barbet,\" said Lousteau. \"Can you tell us of a\nbill-broker that will look at us?\"\n\n\"There is Daddy Chaboisseau, on the Quai Saint-Michel, you know. He\ntided Fendant over his last monthly settlement. If you won't listen to\nmy offer, you might go and see what he says to you; but you would only\ncome back to me, and then I shall offer you two thousand francs\ninstead of three.\"\n\nEtienne and Lucien betook themselves to the Quai Saint-Michel, and\nfound Chaboisseau in a little house with a passage entry. Chaboisseau,\na bill-discounter, whose dealings were principally with the book\ntrade, lived in a second-floor lodging furnished in the most eccentric\nmanner. A brevet-rank banker and millionaire to boot, he had a taste\nfor the classical style. The cornice was in the classical style; the\nbedstead, in the purest classical taste, dated from the time of the\nEmpire, when such things were in fashion; the purple hangings fell\nover the wall like the classic draperies in the background of one of\nDavid's pictures. Chairs and tables, lamps and sconces, and every\nleast detail had evidently been sought with patient care in furniture\nwarehouses. There was the elegance of antiquity about the classic\nrevival as well as its fragile and somewhat arid grace. The man\nhimself, like his manner of life, was in grotesque contrast with the\nairy mythological look of his rooms; and it may be remarked that the\nmost eccentric characters are found among men who give their whole\nenergies to money-making.\n\nMen of this stamp are, in a certain sense, intellectual libertines.\nEverything is within their reach, consequently their fancy is jaded,\nand they will make immense efforts to shake off their indifference.\nThe student of human nature can always discover some hobby, some\naccessible weakness and sensitive spot in their heart. Chaboisseau\nmight have entrenched himself in antiquity as in an impregnable camp.\n\n\"The man will be an antique to match, no doubt,\" said Etienne,\nsmiling.\n\nChaboisseau, a little old person with powdered hair, wore a greenish\ncoat and snuff-brown waistcoat; he was tricked out besides in black\nsmall-clothes, ribbed stockings, and shoes that creaked as he came\nforward to take the bills. After a short scrutiny, he returned them to\nLucien with a serious countenance.\n\n\"MM Fendant and Cavalier are delightful young fellows; they have\nplenty of intelligence; but, I have no money,\" he said blandly.\n\n\"My friend here would be willing to meet you in the matter of\ndiscount----\" Etienne began.\n\n\"I would not take the bills on any consideration,\" returned the little\nbroker. The words slid down upon Lousteau's suggestion like the blade\nof the guillotine on a man's neck.\n\nThe two friends withdrew; but as Chaboisseau went prudently out with\nthem across the ante-chamber, Lucien noticed a pile of second-hand\nbooks. Chaboisseau had been in the trade, and this was a recent\npurchase. Shining conspicuous among them, he noticed a copy of a work\nby the architect Ducereau, which gives exceedingly accurate plans of\nvarious royal palaces and chateaux in France.\n\n\"Could you let me have that book?\" he asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Chaboisseau, transformed into a bookseller.\n\n\"How much?\"\n\n\"Fifty francs.\"\n\n\"It is dear, but I want it. And I can only pay you with one of the\nbills which you refuse to take.\"\n\n\"You have a bill there for five hundred francs at six months; I will\ntake that one of you,\" said Chaboisseau.\n\nApparently at the last statement of accounts, there had been a balance\nof five hundred francs in favor of Fendant and Cavalier.\n\nThey went back to the classical department. Chaboisseau made out a\nlittle memorandum, interest so much and commission so much, total\ndeduction thirty francs, then he subtracted fifty francs for\nDucerceau's book; finally, from a cash-box full of coin, he took four\nhundred and twenty francs.\n\n\"Look here, though, M. Chaboisseau, the bills are either all of them\ngood, or all bad alike; why don't you take the rest?\"\n\n\"This is not discounting; I am paying myself for a sale,\" said the old\nman.\n\nEtienne and Lucien were still laughing at Chaboisseau, without\nunderstanding him, when they reached Dauriat's shop, and Etienne asked\nGabusson to give them the name of a bill-broker. Gabusson thus\nappealed to gave them a letter of introduction to a broker in the\nBoulevard Poissonniere, telling them at the same time that this was\nthe \"oddest and queerest party\" (to use his own expression) that he,\nGabusson, had come across. The friends took a cab by the hour, and\nwent to the address.\n\n\"If Samanon won't take your bills,\" Gabusson had said, \"nobody else\nwill look at them.\"\n\nA second-hand bookseller on the ground floor, a second-hand\nclothes-dealer on the first story, and a seller of indecent prints on\nthe second, Samanon carried on a fourth business--he was a\nmoney-lender into the bargain. No character in Hoffmann's romances, no\nsinister-brooding miser of Scott's, can compare with this freak of\nhuman and Parisian nature (always admitting that Samanon was human).\nIn spite of himself, Lucien shuddered at the sight of the dried-up\nlittle old creature, whose bones seemed to be cutting a leather skin,\nspotted with all sorts of little green and yellow patches, like a\nportrait by Titian or Veronese when you look at it closely. One of\nSamanon's eyes was fixed and glassy, the other lively and bright; he\nseemed to keep that dead eye for the bill-discounting part of his\nprofession, and the other for the trade in the pornographic\ncuriosities upstairs. A few stray white hairs escaping from under a\nsmall, sleek, rusty black wig, stood erect above a sallow forehead\nwith a suggestion of menace about it; a hollow trench in either cheek\ndefined the outline of the jaws; while a set of projecting teeth,\nstill white, seemed to stretch the skin of the lips with the effect\nof an equine yawn. The contrast between the ill-assorted eyes and\ngrinning mouth gave Samanon a passably ferocious air; and the very\nbristles on the man's chin looked stiff and sharp as pins.\n\nNor was there the slightest sign about him of any desire to redeem a\nsinister appearance by attention to the toilet; his threadbare jacket\nwas all but dropping to pieces; a cravat, which had once been black,\nwas frayed by contact with a stubble chin, and left on exhibition a\nthroat as wrinkled as a turkey-gobbler's.\n\nThis was the individual whom Etienne and Lucien discovered in his\nfilthy counting-house, busily affixing tickets to the backs of a\nparcel of books from a recent sale. In a glance, the friends exchanged\nthe innumerable questions raised by the existence of such a creature;\nthen they presented Gabusson's introduction and Fendant and Cavalier's\nbills. Samanon was still reading the note when a third comer entered,\nthe wearer of a short jacket, which seemed in the dimly-lighted shop\nto be cut out of a piece of zinc roofing, so solid was it by reason of\nalloy with all kinds of foreign matter. Oddly attired as he was, the\nman was an artist of no small intellectual power, and ten years later\nhe was destined to assist in the inauguration of the great but\nill-founded Saint-Simonian system.\n\n\"I want my coat, my black trousers, and satin waistcoat,\" said this\nperson, pressing a numbered ticket on Samanon's attention. Samanon\ntouched the brass button of a bell-pull, and a woman came down from\nsome upper region, a Normande apparently, to judge by her rich, fresh\ncomplexion.\n\n\"Let the gentleman have his clothes,\" said Samanon, holding out a hand\nto the newcomer. \"It's a pleasure to do business with you, sir; but\nthat youngster whom one of your friends introduced to me took me in\nmost abominably.\"\n\n\"Took _him_ in!\" chuckled the newcomer, pointing out Samanon to the two\njournalists with an extremely comical gesture. The great man dropped\nthirty sous into the money-lender's yellow, wrinkled hand; like the\nNeapolitan _lazzaroni_, he was taking his best clothes out of pawn for a\nstate occasion. The coins dropped jingling into the till.\n\n\"What queer business are you up to?\" asked Lousteau of the artist, an\nopium-eater who dwelt among visions of enchanted palaces till he\neither could not or would not create.\n\n\"_He_ lends you a good deal more than an ordinary pawnbroker on anything\nyou pledge; and, besides, he is so awfully charitable, he allows you\nto take your clothes out when you must have something to wear. I am\ngoing to dine with the Kellers and my mistress to-night,\" he\ncontinued; \"and to me it is easier to find thirty sous than two\nhundred francs, so I keep my wardrobe here. It has brought the\ncharitable usurer a hundred francs in the last six months. Samanon has\ndevoured my library already, volume by volume\" (_livre a livre_).\n\n\"And sou by sou,\" Lousteau said with a laugh.\n\n\"I will let you have fifteen hundred francs,\" said Samanon, looking\nup.\n\nLucien started, as if the bill-broker had thrust a red-hot skewer\nthrough his heart. Samanon was subjecting the bills and their dates to\na close scrutiny.\n\n\"And even then,\" he added, \"I must see Fendant first. He ought to\ndeposit some books with me. You aren't worth much\" (turning to\nLucien); \"you are living with Coralie, and your furniture has been\nattached.\"\n\nLousteau, watching Lucien, saw him take up his bills, and dash out\ninto the street. \"He is the devil himself!\" exclaimed the poet. For\nseveral seconds he stood outside gazing at the shop front. The whole\nplace was so pitiful, that a passer-by could not see it without\nsmiling at the sight, and wondering what kind of business a man could\ndo among those mean, dirty shelves of ticketed books.\n\nA very few moments later, the great man, in incognito, came out, very\nwell dressed, smiled at his friends, and turned to go with them in the\ndirection of the Passage des Panoramas, where he meant to complete his\ntoilet by the polishing of his boots.\n\n\"If you see Samanon in a bookseller's shop, or calling on a\npaper-merchant or a printer, you may know that it is all over with\nthat man,\" said the artist. \"Samanon is the undertaker come to take\nthe measurements for a coffin.\"\n\n\"You won't discount your bills now, Lucien,\" said Etienne.\n\n\"If Samanon will not take them, nobody else will; he is the _ultima\nratio_,\" said the stranger. \"He is one of Gigonnet's lambs, a spy for\nPalma, Werbrust, Gobseck, and the rest of those crocodiles who swim in\nthe Paris money-market. Every man with a fortune to make, or unmake,\nis sure to come across one of them sooner or later.\"\n\n\"If you cannot discount your bills at fifty per cent,\" remarked\nLousteau, \"you must exchange them for hard cash.\"\n\n\"How?\"\n\n\"Give them to Coralie; Camusot will cash them for her.--You are\ndisgusted,\" added Lousteau, as Lucien cut him short with a start.\n\"What nonsense! How can you allow such a silly scruple to turn the\nscale, when your future is in the balance?\"\n\n\"I shall take this money to Coralie in any case,\" began Lucien.\n\n\"Here is more folly!\" cried Lousteau. \"You will not keep your\ncreditors quiet with four hundred francs when you must have four\nthousand. Let us keep a little and get drunk on it, if we lose the\nrest at _rouge et noir_.\"\n\n\"That is sound advice,\" said the great man.\n\nThose words, spoken not four paces from Frascati's, were magnetic in\ntheir effect. The friends dismissed their cab and went up to the\ngaming-table.\n\nAt the outset they won three thousand francs, then they lost and fell\nto five hundred; again they won three thousand seven hundred francs,\nand again they lost all but a five-franc piece. After another turn of\nluck they staked two thousand francs on an even number to double the\nstake at a stroke; an even number had not turned up for five times in\nsuccession, and this was the sixth time. They punted the whole sum,\nand an odd number turned up once more.\n\nAfter two hours of all-absorbing, frenzied excitement, the two dashed\ndown the staircase with the hundred francs kept back for the dinner.\nUpon the steps, between two pillars which support the little\nsheet-iron veranda to which so many eyes have been upturned in longing\nor despair, Lousteau stopped and looked into Lucien's flushed, excited\nface.\n\n\"Let us just try fifty francs,\" he said.\n\nAnd up the stairs again they went. An hour later they owned a thousand\ncrowns. Black had turned up for the fifth consecutive time; they\ntrusted that their previous luck would not repeat itself, and put the\nwhole sum on the red--black turned up for the sixth time. They had\nlost. It was now six o'clock.\n\n\"Let us just try twenty-five francs,\" said Lucien.\n\nThe new venture was soon made--and lost. The twenty-five francs went\nin five stakes. Then Lucien, in a frenzy, flung down his last\ntwenty-five francs on the number of his age, and won. No words can\ndescribe how his hands trembled as he raked in the coins which the\nbank paid him one by one. He handed ten louis to Lousteau.\n\n\"Fly!\" he cried; \"take it to Very's.\"\n\nLousteau took the hint and went to order dinner. Lucien, left alone,\nlaid his thirty louis on the red and won. Emboldened by the inner\nvoice which a gambler always hears, he staked the whole again on the\nred, and again he won. He felt as if there were a furnace within him.\nWithout heeding the voice, he laid a hundred and twenty louis on the\nblack and lost. Then to the torturing excitement of suspense succeeded\nthe delicious feeling of relief known to the gambler who has nothing\nleft to lose, and must perforce leave the palace of fire in which his\ndreams melt and vanish.\n\nHe found Lousteau at Very's, and flung himself upon the cookery (to\nmake use of Lafontaine's expression), and drowned his cares in wine.\nBy nine o'clock his ideas were so confused that he could not imagine\nwhy the portress in the Rue de Vendome persisted in sending him to the\nRue de la Lune.\n\n\"Mlle. Coralie has gone,\" said the woman. \"She has taken lodgings\nelsewhere. She left her address with me on this scrap of paper.\"\n\nLucien was too far gone to be surprised at anything. He went back to\nthe cab which had brought him, and was driven to the Rue de la Lune,\nmaking puns to himself on the name of the street as he went.\n\nThe news of the failure of the Panorama-Dramatique had come like a\nthunder-clap. Coralie, taking alarm, made haste to sell her furniture\n(with the consent of her creditors) to little old Cardot, who\ninstalled Florentine in the rooms at once. The tradition of the house\nremained unbroken. Coralie paid her creditors and satisfied the\nlandlord, proceeding with her \"washing-day,\" as she called it, while\nBerenice bought the absolutely indispensable necessaries to furnish a\nfourth-floor lodging in the Rue de la Lune, a few doors from the\nGymnase. Here Coralie was waiting for Lucien's return. She had brought\nher love unsullied out of the shipwreck and twelve hundred francs.\n\nLucien, more than half intoxicated, poured out his woes to Coralie and\nBerenice.\n\n\"You did quite right, my angel,\" said Coralie, with her arms about his\nneck. \"Berenice can easily negotiate your bills with Braulard.\"\n\nThe next morning Lucien awoke to an enchanted world of happiness made\nabout him by Coralie. She was more loving and tender in those days\nthan she had ever been; perhaps she thought that the wealth of love in\nher heart should make him amends for the poverty of their lodging. She\nlooked bewitchingly charming, with the loose hair straying from under\nthe crushed white silk handkerchief about her head; there was soft\nlaughter in her eyes; her words were as bright as the first rays of\nsunrise that shone in through the windows, pouring a flood of gold\nupon such charming poverty.\n\nNot that the room was squalid. The walls were covered with a sea-green\npaper, bordered with red; there was one mirror over the chimney-piece,\nand a second above the chest of drawers. The bare boards were covered\nwith a cheap carpet, which Berenice had bought in spite of Coralie's\norders, and paid for out of her own little store. A wardrobe, with a\nglass door and a chest, held the lovers' clothing, the mahogany chairs\nwere covered with blue cotton stuff, and Berenice had managed to save\na clock and a couple of china vases from the catastrophe, as well as\nfour spoons and forks and half-a-dozen little spoons. The bedroom was\nentered from the dining-room, which might have belonged to a clerk\nwith an income of twelve hundred francs. The kitchen was next the\nlanding, and Berenice slept above in an attic. The rent was not more\nthan a hundred crowns.\n\nThe dismal house boasted a sham carriage entrance, the porter's box\nbeing contrived behind one of the useless leaves of the gate, and\nlighted by a peephole through which that personage watched the comings\nand goings of seventeen families, for this hive was a \"good-paying\nproperty,\" in auctioneer's phrase.\n\nLucien, looking round the room, discovered a desk, an easy-chair,\npaper, pens, and ink. The sight of Berenice in high spirits (she was\nbuilding hopes on Coralie's _debut_ at the Gymnase), and of Coralie\nherself conning her part with a knot of blue ribbon tied about it,\ndrove all cares and anxieties from the sobered poet's mind.\n\n\"So long as nobody in society hears of this sudden comedown, we shall\npull through,\" he said. \"After all, we have four thousand five hundred\nfrancs before us. I will turn my new position in Royalist journalism\nto account. To-morrow we shall start the _Reveil_; I am an old hand now,\nand I will make something out.\"\n\nAnd Coralie, seeing nothing but love in the words, kissed the lips\nthat uttered them. By this time Berenice had set the table near the\nfire and served a modest breakfast of scrambled eggs, a couple of\ncutlets, coffee, and cream. Just then there came a knock at the door,\nand Lucien, to his astonishment, beheld three of his loyal friends of\nold days--d'Arthez, Leon Giraud, and Michel Chrestien. He was deeply\ntouched, and asked them to share the breakfast.\n\n\"No; we have come on more serious business than condolence,\" said\nd'Arthez; \"we know the whole story, we have just come from the Rue de\nVendome. You know my opinions, Lucien. Under any other circumstances I\nshould be glad to hear that you had adopted my political convictions;\nbut situated as you are with regard to the Liberal Press, it is\nimpossible for you to go over to the Ultras. Your life will be\nsullied, your character blighted for ever. We have come to entreat you\nin the name of our friendship, weakened though it may be, not to soil\nyourself in this way. You have been prominent in attacking the\nRomantics, the Right, and the Government; you cannot now declare for\nthe Government; the Right, and the Romantics.\"\n\n\"My reasons for the change are based on lofty grounds; the end will\njustify the means,\" said Lucien.\n\n\"Perhaps you do not fully comprehend our position on the side of the\nGovernment,\" said Leon Giraud. \"The Government, the Court, the\nBourbons, the Absolutist Party, or to sum up in the general\nexpression, the whole system opposed to the constitutional system, may\nbe divided upon the question of the best means of extinguishing the\nRevolution, but is unanimous as to the advisability of extinguishing\nthe newspapers. The _Reveil_, the _Foudre_, and the _Drapeau Blanc_ have\nall been founded for the express purpose of replying to the slander,\ngibes, and railing of the Liberal press. I cannot approve them, for it\nis precisely this failure to recognize the grandeur of our priesthood\nthat has led us to bring out a serious and self-respecting paper;\nwhich perhaps,\" he added parenthetically, \"may exercise a worthy\ninfluence before very long, and win respect, and carry weight; but\nthis Royalist artillery is destined for a first attempt at reprisals,\nthe Liberals are to be paid back in their own coin--shaft for shaft,\nwound for wound.\n\n\"What can come of it Lucien? The majority of newspaper readers incline\nfor the Left; and in the press, as in warfare, the victory is with the\nbig battalions. You will be blackguards, liars, enemies of the people;\nthe other side will be defenders of their country, martyrs, men to be\nheld in honor, though they may be even more hypocritical and slippery\nthan their opponents. In these ways the pernicious influence of the\npress will be increased, while the most odious form of journalism will\nreceive sanction. Insult and personalities will become a recognized\nprivilege of the press; newspapers have taken this tone in the\nsubscribers' interests; and when both sides have recourse to the same\nweapons, the standard is set and the general tone of journalism taken\nfor granted. When the evil is developed to its fullest extent,\nrestrictive laws will be followed by prohibitions; there will be a\nreturn of the censorship of the press imposed after the assassination\nof the Duc de Berri, and repealed since the opening of the Chambers.\nAnd do you know what the nation will conclude from the debate? The\npeople will believe the insinuations of the Liberal press; they will\nthink that the Bourbons mean to attack the rights of property acquired\nby the Revolution, and some fine day they will rise and shake off the\nBourbons. You are not only soiling your life, Lucien, you are going\nover to the losing side. You are too young, too lately a journalist,\ntoo little initiated into the secret springs of motive and the tricks\nof the craft, you have aroused too much jealousy, not to fall a victim\nto the general hue and cry that will be raised against you in the\nLiberal newspapers. You will be drawn into the fray by party spirit\nnow still at fever-heat; though the fever, which spent itself in\nviolence in 1815 and 1816, now appears in debates in the Chamber and\npolemics in the papers.\"\n\n\"I am not quite a featherhead, my friends,\" said Lucien, \"though you\nmay choose to see a poet in me. Whatever may happen, I shall gain one\nsolid advantage which no Liberal victory can give me. By the time your\nvictory is won, I shall have gained my end.\"\n\n\"We will cut off--your hair,\" said Michel Chrestien, with a laugh.\n\n\"I shall have my children by that time,\" said Lucien; \"and if you cut\noff my head, it will not matter.\"\n\nThe three could make nothing of Lucien. Intercourse with the great\nworld had developed in him the pride of caste, the vanities of the\naristocrat. The poet thought, and not without reason, that there was a\nfortune in his good looks and intellect, accompanied by the name and\ntitle of Rubempre. Mme. d'Espard and Mme. de Bargeton held him fast by\nthis clue, as a child holds a cockchafer by a string. Lucien's flight\nwas circumscribed. The words, \"He is one of us, he is sound,\"\naccidentally overheard but three days ago in Mlle. de Touches' salon,\nhad turned his head. The Duc de Lenoncourt, the Duc de Navarreins, the\nDuc de Grandlieu, Rastignac, Blondet, the lovely Duchesse de\nMaufrigneuse, the Comte d'Escrignon, and des Lupeaulx, all the most\ninfluential people at Court in fact, had congratulated him on his\nconversion, and completed his intoxication.\n\n\"Then there is no more to be said,\" d'Arthez rejoined. \"You, of all\nmen, will find it hard to keep clean hands and self-respect. I know\nyou, Lucien; you will feel it acutely when you are despised by the\nvery men to whom you offer yourself.\"\n\nThe three took leave, and not one of them gave him a friendly\nhandshake. Lucien was thoughtful and sad for a few minutes.\n\n\"Oh! never mind those ninnies,\" cried Coralie, springing upon his knee\nand putting her beautiful arms about his neck. \"They take life\nseriously, and life is a joke. Besides, you are going to be Count\nLucien de Rubempre. I will wheedle the _Chancellerie_ if there is no\nother way. I know how to come round that rake of a des Lupeaulx, who\nwill sign your patent. Did I not tell you, Lucien, that at the last\nyou should have Coralie's dead body for a stepping stone?\"\n\nNext day Lucien allowed his name to appear in the list of contributors\nto the _Reveil_. His name was announced in the prospectus with a\nflourish of trumpets, and the Ministry took care that a hundred\nthousand copies should be scattered abroad far and wide. There was a\ndinner at Robert's, two doors away from Frascati's, to celebrate the\ninauguration, and the whole band of Royalist writers for the press\nwere present. Martainville was there, and Auger and Destains, and a\nhost of others, still living, who \"did Monarchy and religion,\" to use\nthe familiar expression coined for them. Nathan had also enlisted\nunder the banner, for he was thinking of starting a theatre, and not\nunreasonably held that it was better to have the licensing authorities\nfor him than against him.\n\n\"We will pay the Liberals out,\" cried Merlin.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" said Nathan, \"if we are for war, let us have war in\nearnest; we must not carry it on with pop-guns. Let us fall upon all\nClassicals and Liberals without distinction of age or sex, and put\nthem all to the sword with ridicule. There must be no quarter.\"\n\n\"We must act honorably; there must be no bribing with copies of books\nor presents; no taking money of publishers. We must inaugurate a\nRestoration of Journalism.\"\n\n\"Good!\" said Martainville. \"_Justum et tenacem propositi virum_! Let us\nbe implacable and virulent. I will give out La Fayette for the prince\nof harlequins that he is!\"\n\n\"And I will undertake the heroes of the _Constitutionnel_,\" added\nLucien; \"Sergeant Mercier, M. Jouy's Complete Works, and 'the\nillustrious orators of the Left.'\"\n\nA war of extermination was unanimously resolved upon, and by one\no'clock in the morning all shades of opinion were merged and drowned,\ntogether with every glimmer of sense, in a flaming bowl of punch.\n\n\"We have had a fine Monarchical and Religious jollification,\" remarked\nan illustrious reveler in the doorway as he went.\n\nThat comment appeared in the next day's issue of the _Miroir_ through\nthe good offices of a publisher among the guests, and became historic.\nLucien was supposed to be the traitor who blabbed. His defection gave\nthe signal for a terrific hubbub in the Liberal camp; Lucien was the\nbutt of the Opposition newspapers, and ridiculed unmercifully. The\nwhole history of his sonnets was given to the public. Dauriat was said\nto prefer a first loss of a thousand crowns to the risk of publishing\nthe verses; Lucien was called \"the Poet sans Sonnets;\" and one\nmorning, in that very paper in which he had so brilliant a beginning,\nhe read the following lines, significant enough for him, but barely\nintelligible to other readers:\n\n\n  *** \"If M. Dauriat persistently withholds the Sonnets of the\n  future Petrarch from publication, we will act like generous foes.\n  We will open our own columns to his poems, which must be piquant\n  indeed, to judge by the following specimen obligingly communicated\n  by a friend of the author.\"\n\n\nAnd close upon that ominous preface followed a sonnet entitled \"The\nThistle\" (_le Chardon)_:\n\n\n  A chance-come seedling, springing up one day\n  Among the flowers in a garden fair,\n  Made boast that splendid colors bright and rare\n  Its claims to lofty lineage should display.\n\n  So for a while they suffered it to stay;\n  But with such insolence it flourished there,\n  That, out of patience with its braggart's air,\n  They bade it prove its claims without delay.\n\n  It bloomed forthwith; but ne'er was blundering clown\n  Upon the boards more promptly hooted down;\n  The sister flowers began to jeer and laugh.\n\n  The owner flung it out. At close of day\n  A solitary jackass came to bray--\n  A common Thistle's fitting epitaph.\n\n\nLucien read the words through scalding tears.\n\nVernou touched elsewhere on Lucien's gambling propensities, and spoke\nof the forthcoming _Archer of Charles IX._ as \"anti-national\" in its\ntendency, the writer siding with Catholic cut-throats against their\nCalvinist victims.\n\nAnother week found the quarrel embittered. Lucien had counted upon his\nfriend Etienne; Etienne owed him a thousand francs, and there had been\nbesides a private understanding between them; but Etienne Lousteau\nduring the interval became his sworn foe, and this was the manner of\nit.\n\nFor the past three months Nathan had been smitten with Florine's\ncharms, and much at a loss how to rid himself of Lousteau his rival,\nwho was in fact dependent upon the actress. And now came Nathan's\nopportunity, when Florine was frantic with distress over the failure\nof the Panorama-Dramatique, which left her without an engagement. He\nwent as Lucien's colleague to beg Coralie to ask for a part for\nFlorine in a play of his which was about to be produced at the\nGymnase. Then Nathan went to Florine and made capital with her out of\nthe service done by the promise of a conditional engagement. Ambition\nturned Florine's head; she did not hesitate. She had had time to gauge\nLousteau pretty thoroughly. Lousteau's courses were weakening his\nwill, and here was Nathan with his ambitions in politics and\nliterature, and energies strong as his cravings. Florine proposed to\nreappear on the stage with renewed eclat, so she handed over Matifat's\ncorrespondence to Nathan. Nathan drove a bargain for them with\nMatifat, and took the sixth share of Finot's review in exchange for\nthe compromising billets. After this, Florine was installed in\nsumptuously furnished apartments in the Rue Hauteville, where she took\nNathan for her protector in the face of the theatrical and\njournalistic world.\n\nLousteau was terribly overcome. He wept (towards the close of a dinner\ngiven by his friends to console him in his affliction). In the course\nof that banquet it was decided that Nathan had not acted unfairly;\nseveral writers present--Finot and Vernou, for instance,--knew of\nFlorine's fervid admiration for dramatic literature; but they all\nagreed that Lucien had behaved very ill when he arranged that business\nat the Gymnase; he had indeed broken the most sacred laws of\nfriendship. Party-spirit and zeal to serve his new friends had led the\nRoyalist poet on to sin beyond forgiveness.\n\n\"Nathan was carried away by passion,\" pronounced Bixiou, \"while this\n'distinguished provincial,' as Blondet calls him, is simply scheming\nfor his own selfish ends.\"\n\nAnd so it came to pass that deep plots were laid by all parties alike\nto rid themselves of this little upstart intruder of a poet who wanted\nto eat everybody up. Vernou bore Lucien a personal grudge, and\nundertook to keep a tight hand on him; and Finot declared that Lucien\nhad betrayed the secret of the combination against Matifat, and\nthereby swindled him (Finot) out of fifty thousand francs. Nathan,\nacting on Florine's advice, gained Finot's support by selling him the\nsixth share for fifteen thousand francs, and Lousteau consequently\nlost his commission. His thousand crowns had vanished away; he could\nnot forgive Lucien for this treacherous blow (as he supposed it) dealt\nto his interests. The wounds of vanity refuse to heal if oxide of\nsilver gets into them.\n\nNo words, no amount of description, can depict the wrath of an author\nin a paroxysm of mortified vanity, nor the energy which he discovers\nwhen stung by the poisoned darts of sarcasm; but, on the other hand,\nthe man that is roused to fighting-fury by a personal attack usually\nsubsides very promptly. The more phlegmatic race, who take these\nthings quietly, lay their account with the oblivion which speedily\novertakes the spiteful article. These are the truly courageous men of\nletters; and if the weaklings seem at first to be the strong men, they\ncannot hold out for any length of time.\n\nDuring that first fortnight, while the fury was upon him, Lucien\npoured a perfect hailstorm of articles into the Royalist papers, in\nwhich he shared the responsibilities of criticism with Hector Merlin.\nHe was always in the breach, pounding away with all his might in the\n_Reveil_, backed up by Martainville, the only one among his associates\nwho stood by him without an afterthought. Martainville was not in the\nsecret of certain understandings made and ratified amid after-dinner\njokes, or at Dauriat's in the Wooden Galleries, or behind the scenes\nat the Vaudeville, when journalists of either side met on neutral\nground.\n\nWhen Lucien went to the greenroom of the Vaudeville, he met with no\nwelcome; the men of his own party held out a hand to shake, the others\ncut him; and all the while Hector Merlin and Theodore Gaillard\nfraternized unblushingly with Finot, Lousteau, and Vernou, and the\nrest of the journalists who were known for \"good fellows.\"\n\nThe greenroom of the Vaudeville in those days was a hotbed of gossip,\nas well as a neutral ground where men of every shade of opinion could\nmeet; so much so that the President of a court of law, after reproving\na learned brother in a certain council chamber for \"sweeping the\ngreenroom with his gown,\" met the subject of his strictures, gown to\ngown, in the greenroom of the Vaudeville. Lousteau, in time, shook\nhands again with Nathan; Finot came thither almost every evening; and\nLucien, whenever he could spare the time, went to the Vaudeville to\nwatch the enemies, who showed no sign of relenting towards the\nunfortunate boy.\n\nIn the time of the Restoration party hatred was far more bitter than\nin our day. Intensity of feeling is diminished in our high-pressure\nage. The critic cuts a book to pieces and shakes hands with the author\nafterwards, and the victim must keep on good terms with his\nslaughterer, or run the gantlet of innumerable jokes at his expense.\nIf he refuses, he is unsociable, eaten up with self-love, he is sulky\nand rancorous, he bears malice, he is a bad bed-fellow. To-day let an\nauthor receive a treacherous stab in the back, let him avoid the\nsnares set for him with base hypocrisy, and endure the most unhandsome\ntreatment, he must still exchange greetings with his assassin, who,\nfor that matter, claims the esteem and friendship of his victim.\nEverything can be excused and justified in an age which has\ntransformed vice into virtue and virtue into vice. Good-fellowship has\ncome to be the most sacred of our liberties; the representatives of\nthe most opposite opinions courteously blunt the edge of their words,\nand fence with buttoned foils. But in those almost forgotten days the\nsame theatre could scarcely hold certain Royalist and Liberal\njournalists; the most malignant provocation was offered, glances were\nlike pistol-shots, the least spark produced an explosion of quarrel.\nWho has not heard his neighbor's half-smothered oath on the entrance\nof some man in the forefront of the battle on the opposing side? There\nwere but two parties--Royalists and Liberals, Classics and Romantics.\nYou found the same hatred masquerading in either form, and no longer\nwondered at the scaffolds of the Convention.\n\nLucien had been a Liberal and a hot Voltairean; now he was a rabid\nRoyalist and a Romantic. Martainville, the only one among his\ncolleagues who really liked him and stood by him loyally, was more\nhated by the Liberals than any man on the Royalist side, and this fact\ndrew down all the hate of the Liberals on Lucien's head.\nMartainville's staunch friendship injured Lucien. Political parties\nshow scanty gratitude to outpost sentinels, and leave leaders of\nforlorn hopes to their fate; 'tis a rule of warfare which holds\nequally good in matters political, to keep with the main body of the\narmy if you mean to succeed. The spite of the small Liberal papers\nfastened at once on the opportunity of coupling the two names, and\nflung them into each other's arms. Their friendship, real or\nimaginary, brought down upon them both a series of articles written by\npens dipped in gall. Felicien Vernou was furious with jealousy of\nLucien's social success; and believed, like all his old associates, in\nthe poet's approaching elevation.\n\nThe fiction of Lucien's treason was embellished with every kind of\naggravating circumstance; he was called Judas the Less, Martainville\nbeing Judas the Great, for Martainville was supposed (rightly or\nwrongly) to have given up the Bridge of Pecq to the foreign invaders.\nLucien said jestingly to des Lupeaulx that he himself, surely, had\ngiven up the Asses' Bridge.\n\nLucien's luxurious life, hollow though it was, and founded on\nexpectations, had estranged his friends. They could not forgive him\nfor the carriage which he had put down--for them he was still rolling\nabout in it--nor yet for the splendors of the Rue de Vendome which he\nhad left. All of them felt instinctively that nothing was beyond the\nreach of this young and handsome poet, with intellect enough and to\nspare; they themselves had trained him in corruption; and, therefore,\nthey left no stone unturned to ruin him.\n\nSome few days before Coralie's first appearance at the Gymnase, Lucien\nand Hector Merlin went arm-in-arm to the Vaudeville. Merlin was\nscolding his friend for giving a helping hand to Nathan in Florine's\naffair.\n\n\"You then and there made two mortal enemies of Lousteau and Nathan,\"\nhe said. \"I gave you good advice, and you took no notice of it. You\ngave praise, you did them a good turn--you will be well punished for\nyour kindness. Florine and Coralie will never live in peace on the\nsame stage; both will wish to be first. You can only defend Coralie in\nour papers; and Nathan not only has a pull as a dramatic author, he\ncan control the dramatic criticism in the Liberal newspapers. He has\nbeen a journalist a little longer than you!\"\n\nThe words responded to Lucien's inward misgivings. Neither Nathan nor\nGaillard was treating him with the frankness which he had a right to\nexpect, but so new a convert could hardly complain. Gaillard utterly\nconfounded Lucien by saying roundly that newcomers must give proofs of\ntheir sincerity for some time before their party could trust them.\nThere was more jealousy than he had imagined in the inner circles of\nRoyalist and Ministerial journalism. The jealousy of curs fighting for\na bone is apt to appear in the human species when there is a loaf to\ndivide; there is the same growling and showing of teeth, the same\ncharacteristics come out.\n\nIn every possible way these writers of articles tried to injure each\nother with those in power; they brought reciprocal accusations of\nlukewarm zeal; they invented the most treacherous ways of getting rid\nof a rival. There had been none of this internecine warfare among the\nLiberals; they were too far from power, too hopelessly out of favor;\nand Lucien, amid the inextricable tangle of ambitions, had neither the\ncourage to draw sword and cut the knot, or the patience to unravel it.\nHe could not be the Beaumarchais, the Aretino, the Freron of his\nepoch; he was not made of such stuff; he thought of nothing but his\none desire, the patent of nobility; for he saw clearly that for him\nsuch a restoration meant a wealthy marriage, and, the title once\nsecured, chance and his good looks would do the rest. This was all his\nplan, and Etienne Lousteau, who had confided so much to him, knew his\nsecret, knew how to deal a deathblow to the poet of Angouleme. That\nvery night, as Lucien and Merlin went to the Vaudeville, Etienne had\nlaid a terrible trap, into which an inexperienced boy could not but\nfall.\n\n\"Here is our handsome Lucien,\" said Finot, drawing des Lupeaulx in the\ndirection of the poet, and shaking hands with feline amiability. \"I\ncannot think of another example of such rapid success,\" continued\nFinot, looking from des Lupeaulx to Lucien. \"There are two sorts of\nsuccess in Paris: there is a fortune in solid cash, which any one can\namass, and there is the intangible fortune of connections, position,\nor a footing in certain circles inaccessible for certain persons,\nhowever rich they may be. Now my friend here----\"\n\n\"Our friend,\" interposed des Lupeaulx, smiling blandly.\n\n\"Our friend,\" repeated Finot, patting Lucien's hand, \"has made a\nbrilliant success from this point of view. Truth to tell, Lucien has\nmore in him, more gift, more wit than the rest of us that envy him,\nand he is enchantingly handsome besides; his old friends cannot\nforgive him for his success--they call it luck.\"\n\n\"Luck of that sort never comes to fools or incapables,\" said des\nLupeaulx. \"Can you call Bonaparte's fortune luck, eh? There were a\nscore of applicants for the command of the army in Italy, just as\nthere are a hundred young men at this moment who would like to have an\nentrance to Mlle. des Touches' house; people are coupling her name\nwith yours already in society, my dear boy,\" said des Lupeaulx,\nclapping Lucien on the shoulder. \"Ah! you are in high favor. Mme.\nd'Espard, Mme. de Bargeton, and Mme. de Montcornet are wild about you.\nYou are going to Mme. Firmiani's party to-night, are you not, and to\nthe Duchesse de Grandlieu's rout to-morrow?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Lucien.\n\n\"Allow me to introduce a young banker to you, a M. du Tillet; you\nought to be acquainted, he has contrived to make a great fortune in a\nshort time.\"\n\nLucien and du Tillet bowed, and entered into conversation, and the\nbanker asked Lucien to dinner. Finot and des Lupeaulx, a well-matched\npair, knew each other well enough to keep upon good terms; they turned\naway to continue their chat on one of the sofas in the greenroom, and\nleft Lucien with du Tillet, Merlin, and Nathan.\n\n\"By the way, my friend,\" said Finot, \"tell me how things stand. Is\nthere really somebody behind Lucien? For he is the _bete noire_ of my\nstaff; and before allowing them to plot against him, I thought I\nshould like to know whether, in your opinion, it would be better to\nbaffle them and keep well with him.\"\n\nThe Master of Requests and Finot looked at each other very closely for\na moment or two.\n\n\"My dear fellow,\" said des Lupeaulx, \"how can you imagine that the\nMarquise d'Espard, or Chatelet, or Mme. de Bargeton--who has procured\nthe Baron's nomination to the prefecture and the title of Count, so as\nto return in triumph to Angouleme--how can you suppose that any of\nthem will forgive Lucien for his attacks on them? They dropped him\ndown in the Royalist ranks to crush him out of existence. At this\nmoment they are looking round for any excuse for not fulfilling the\npromises they made to that boy. Help them to some; you will do the\ngreatest possible service to the two women, and some day or other they\nwill remember it. I am in their secrets; I was surprised to find how\nmuch they hated the little fellow. This Lucien might have rid himself\nof his bitterest enemy (Mme. de Bargeton) by desisting from his\nattacks on terms which a woman loves to grant--do you take me? He is\nyoung and handsome, he should have drowned her hate in torrents of\nlove, he would be Comte de Rubempre by this time; the Cuttlefish-bone\nwould have obtained some sinecure for him, some post in the Royal\nHousehold. Lucien would have made a very pretty reader to Louis\nXVIII.; he might have been librarian somewhere or other, Master of\nRequests for a joke, Master of Revels, what you please. The young fool\nhas missed his chance. Perhaps that is his unpardonable sin. Instead\nof imposing his conditions, he has accepted them. When Lucien was\ncaught with the bait of the patent of nobility, the Baron Chatelet\nmade a great step. Coralie has been the ruin of that boy. If he had\nnot had the actress for his mistress, he would have turned again to\nthe Cuttlefish-bone; and he would have had her too.\"\n\n\"Then we can knock him over?\"\n\n\"How?\" des Lupeaulx asked carelessly. He saw a way of gaining credit\nwith the Marquise d'Espard for this service.\n\n\"He is under contract to write for Lousteau's paper, and we can the\nbetter hold him to his agreement because he has not a sou. If we\ntickle up the Keeper of the Seals with a facetious article, and prove\nthat Lucien wrote it, he will consider that Lucien is unworthy of the\nKing's favor. We have a plot on hand besides. Coralie will be ruined,\nand our distinguished provincial will lose his head when his mistress\nis hissed off the stage and left without an engagement. When once the\npatent is suspended, we will laugh at the victim's aristocratic\npretensions, and allude to his mother the nurse and his father the\napothecary. Lucien's courage is only skindeep, he will collapse; we\nwill send him back to his provinces. Nathan made Florine sell me\nMatifat's sixth share of the review, I was able to buy; Dauriat and I\nare the only proprietors now; we might come to an understanding, you\nand I, and the review might be taken over for the benefit of the\nCourt. I stipulated for the restitution of my sixth before I undertook\nto protect Nathan and Florine; they let me have it, and I must help\nthem; but I wished to know first how Lucien stood----\"\n\n\"You deserve your name,\" said des Lupeaulx. \"I like a man of your\nsort----\"\n\n\"Very well. Then can you arrange a definite engagement for Florine?\"\nasked Finot.\n\n\"Yes, but rid us of Lucien, for Rastignac and de Marsay never wish to\nhear of him again.\"\n\n\"Sleep in peace,\" returned Finot. \"Nathan and Merlin will always have\narticles ready for Gaillard, who will promise to take them; Lucien\nwill never get a line into the paper. We will cut off his supplies.\nThere is only Martainville's paper left him in which to defend himself\nand Coralie; what can a single paper do against so many?\"\n\n\"I will let you know the weak points of the Ministry; but get Lucien\nto write that article and hand over the manuscript,\" said des\nLupeaulx, who refrained carefully from informing Finot that Lucien's\npromised patent was nothing but a joke.\n\nWhen des Lupeaulx had gone, Finot went to Lucien, and taking the\ngood-natured tone which deceives so many victims, he explained that\nhe could not possibly afford to lose his contributor, and at the same\ntime he shrank from taking proceedings which might ruin him with his\nfriends of the other side. Finot himself liked a man who was strong\nenough to change his opinions. They were pretty sure to come across\none another, he and Lucien, and might be mutually helpful in a\nthousand little ways. Lucien, besides, needed a sure man in the\nLiberal party to attack the Ultras and men in office who might refuse\nto help him.\n\n\"Suppose that they play you false, what will you do?\" Finot ended.\n\"Suppose that some Minister fancies that he has you fast by the halter\nof your apostasy, and turns the cold shoulder on you? You will be glad\nto set on a few dogs to snap at his legs, will you not? Very well. But\nyou have made a deadly enemy of Lousteau; he is thirsting for your\nblood. You and Felicien are not on speaking terms. I only remain to\nyou. It is a rule of the craft to keep a good understanding with every\nman of real ability. In the world which you are about to enter you can\ndo me services in return for mine with the press. But business first.\nLet me have purely literary articles; they will not compromise you,\nand we shall have executed our agreement.\"\n\nLucien saw nothing but good-fellowship and a shrewd eye to business in\nFinot's offer; Finot and des Lupeaulx had flattered him, and he was in\na good humor. He actually thanked Finot!\n\nAmbitious men, like all those who can only make their way by the help\nof others and of circumstances, are bound to lay their plans very\ncarefully and to adhere very closely to the course of conduct on which\nthey determine; it is a cruel moment in the lives of such aspirants\nwhen some unknown power brings the fabric of their fortunes to some\nsevere test and everything gives way at once; threads are snapped or\nentangled, and misfortune appears on every side. Let a man lose his\nhead in the confusion, it is all over with him; but if he can resist\nthis first revolt of circumstances, if he can stand erect until the\ntempest passes over, or make a supreme effort and reach the serene\nsphere about the storm--then he is really strong. To every man, unless\nhe is born rich, there comes sooner or later \"his fatal week,\" as it\nmust be called. For Napoleon, for instance, that week was the Retreat\nfrom Moscow. It had begun now for Lucien.\n\nSocial and literary success had come to him too easily; he had had\nsuch luck that he was bound to know reverses and to see men and\ncircumstances turn against him.\n\nThe first blow was the heaviest and the most keenly felt, for it\ntouched Lucien where he thought himself invulnerable--in his heart and\nhis love. Coralie might not be clever, but hers was a noble nature,\nand she possessed the great actress' faculty of suddenly standing\naloof from self. This strange phenomenon is subject, until it\ndegenerates into a habit with long practice, to the caprices of\ncharacter, and not seldom to an admirable delicacy of feeling in\nactresses who are still young. Coralie, to all appearance bold and\nwanton, as the part required, was in reality girlish and timid, and\nlove had wrought in her a revulsion of her woman's heart against the\ncomedian's mask. Art, the supreme art of feigning passion and feeling,\nhad not yet triumphed over nature in her; she shrank before a great\naudience from the utterance that belongs to Love alone; and Coralie\nsuffered besides from another true woman's weakness--she needed\nsuccess, born stage queen though she was. She could not confront an\naudience with which she was out of sympathy; she was nervous when she\nappeared on the stage, a cold reception paralyzed her. Each new part\ngave her the terrible sensations of a first appearance. Applause\nproduced a sort of intoxication which gave her encouragement without\nflattering her vanity; at a murmur of dissatisfaction or before a\nsilent house, she flagged; but a great audience following attentively,\nadmiringly, willing to be pleased, electrified Coralie. She felt at\nonce in communication with the nobler qualities of all those\nlisteners; she felt that she possessed the power of stirring their\nsouls and carrying them with her. But if this action and reaction of\nthe audience upon the actress reveals the nervous organization of\ngenius, it shows no less clearly the poor child's sensitiveness and\ndelicacy. Lucien had discovered the treasures of her nature; had\nlearned in the past months that this woman who loved him was still so\nmuch of a girl. And Coralie was unskilled in the wiles of an actress\n--she could not fight her own battles nor protect herself against the\nmachinations of jealousy behind the scenes. Florine was jealous of\nher, and Florine was as dangerous and depraved as Coralie was simple\nand generous. Roles must come to find Coralie; she was too proud to\nimplore authors or to submit to dishonoring conditions; she would not\ngive herself to the first journalist who persecuted her with his\nadvances and threatened her with his pen. Genius is rare enough in the\nextraordinary art of the stage; but genius is only one condition of\nsuccess among many, and is positively hurtful unless it is accompanied\nby a genius for intrigue in which Coralie was utterly lacking.\n\nLucien knew how much his friend would suffer on her first appearance\nat the Gymnase, and was anxious at all costs to obtain a success for\nher; but all the money remaining from the sale of the furniture and\nall Lucien's earnings had been sunk in costumes, in the furniture of a\ndressing-room, and the expenses of a first appearance.\n\nA few days later, Lucien made up his mind to a humiliating step for\nlove's sake. He took Fendant and Cavalier's bills, and went to the\n_Golden Cocoon_ in the Rue des Bourdonnais. He would ask Camusot to\ndiscount them. The poet had not fallen so low that he could make this\nattempt quite coolly. There had been many a sharp struggle first, and\nthe way to that decision had been paved with many dreadful thoughts.\nNevertheless, he arrived at last in the dark, cheerless little private\noffice that looked out upon a yard, and found Camusot seated gravely\nthere; this was not Coralie's infatuated adorer, not the easy-natured,\nindolent, incredulous libertine whom he had known hitherto as Camusot,\nbut a heavy father of a family, a merchant grown old in shrewd\nexpedients of business and respectable virtues, wearing a magistrate's\nmask of judicial prudery; this Camusot was the cool, business-like\nhead of the firm surrounded by clerks, green cardboard boxes,\npigeonholes, invoices, and samples, and fortified by the presence of a\nwife and a plainly-dressed daughter. Lucien trembled from head to foot\nas he approached; for the worthy merchant, like the money-lenders,\nturned cool, indifferent eyes upon him.\n\n\"Here are two or three bills, monsieur,\" he said, standing beside the\nmerchant, who did not rise from his desk. \"If you will take them of\nme, you will oblige me extremely.\"\n\n\"You have taken something of _me_, monsieur,\" said Camusot; \"I do not\nforget it.\"\n\nOn this, Lucien explained Coralie's predicament. He spoke in a low\nvoice, bending to murmur his explanation, so that Camusot could hear\nthe heavy throbbing of the humiliated poet's heart. It was no part of\nCamusot's plans that Coralie should suffer a check. He listened,\nsmiling to himself over the signatures on the bills (for, as a judge\nat the Tribunal of Commerce, he knew how the booksellers stood), but\nin the end he gave Lucien four thousand five hundred francs for them,\nstipulating that he should add the formula \"For value received in\nsilks.\"\n\nLucien went straight to Braulard, and made arrangements for a good\nreception. Braulard promised to come to the dress-rehearsal, to\ndetermine on the points where his \"Romans\" should work their fleshy\nclappers to bring down the house in applause. Lucien gave the rest of\nthe money to Coralie (he did not tell her how he had come by it), and\nallayed her anxieties and the fears of Berenice, who was sorely\ntroubled over their daily expenses.\n\nMartainville came several times to hear Coralie rehearse, and he knew\nmore of the stage than most men of his time; several Royalist writers\nhad promised favorable articles; Lucien had not a suspicion of the\nimpending disaster.\n\nA fatal event occurred on the evening before Coralie's _debut_.\nD'Arthez's book had appeared; and the editor of Merlin's paper,\nconsidering Lucien to be the best qualified man on the staff, gave him\nthe book to review. He owed his unlucky reputation to those articles\non Nathan's work. There were several men in the office at the time,\nfor all the staff had been summoned; Martainville was explaining that\nthe party warfare with the Liberals must be waged on certain lines.\nNathan, Merlin, all the contributors, in fact, were talking of Leon\nGiraud's paper, and remarking that its influence was the more\npernicious because the language was guarded, cool, moderate. People\nwere beginning to speak of the circle in the Rue des Quatre-Vents as a\nsecond Convention. It had been decided that the Royalist papers were\nto wage a systematic war of extermination against these dangerous\nopponents, who, indeed, at a later day, were destined to sow the\ndoctrines that drove the Bourbons into exile; but that was only after\nthe most brilliant of Royalist writers had joined them for the sake of\na mean revenge.\n\nD'Arthez's absolutist opinions were not known; it was taken for\ngranted that he shared the views of his clique, he fell under the same\nanathema, and he was to be the first victim. His book was to be\nhonored with \"a slashing article,\" to use the consecrated formula.\nLucien refused to write the article. Great was the commotion among the\nleading Royalist writers thus met in conclave. Lucien was told plainly\nthat a renegade could not do as he pleased; if it did not suit his\nviews to take the side of the Monarchy and Religion, he could go back\nto the other camp. Merlin and Martainville took him aside and begged\nhim, as his friends, to remember that he would simply hand Coralie\nover to the tender mercies of the Liberal papers, for she would find\nno champions on the Royalist and Ministerial side. Her acting was\ncertain to provoke a hot battle, and the kind of discussion which\nevery actress longs to arouse.\n\n\"You don't understand it in the least,\" said Martainville; \"if she\nplays for three months amid a cross-fire of criticism, she will make\nthirty thousand francs when she goes on tour in the provinces at the\nend of the season; and here are you about to sacrifice Coralie and\nyour own future, and to quarrel with your own bread and butter, all\nfor a scruple that will always stand in your way, and ought to be got\nrid of at once.\"\n\nLucien was forced to choose between d'Arthez and Coralie. His mistress\nwould be ruined unless he dealt his friend a death-blow in the _Reveil_\nand the great newspaper. Poor poet! He went home with death in his\nsoul; and by the fireside he sat and read that finest production of\nmodern literature. Tears fell fast over it as the pages turned. For a\nlong while he hesitated, but at last he took up the pen and wrote a\nsarcastic article of the kind that he understood so well, taking the\nbook as children might take some bright bird to strip it of its\nplumage and torture it. His sardonic jests were sure to tell. Again he\nturned to the book, and as he read it over a second time, his better\nself awoke. In the dead of night he hurried across Paris, and stood\noutside d'Arthez's house. He looked up at the windows and saw the\nfaint pure gleam of light in the panes, as he had so often seen it,\nwith a feeling of admiration for the noble steadfastness of that truly\ngreat nature. For some moments he stood irresolute on the curbstone;\nhe had not courage to go further; but his good angel urged him on. He\ntapped at the door and opened, and found d'Arthez sitting reading in a\nfireless room.\n\n\"What has happened?\" asked d'Arthez, for news of some dreadful kind\nwas visible in Lucien's ghastly face.\n\n\"Your book is sublime, d'Arthez,\" said Lucien, with tears in his eyes,\n\"and they have ordered me to write an attack upon it.\"\n\n\"Poor boy! the bread that they give you is hard indeed!\" said d'Arthez\n\n\"I only ask for one favor, keep my visit a secret and leave me to my\nhell, to the occupations of the damned. Perhaps it is impossible to\nattain to success until the heart is seared and callous in every most\nsensitive spot.\"\n\n\"The same as ever!\" cried d'Arthez.\n\n\"Do you think me a base poltroon? No, d'Arthez; no, I am a boy half\ncrazed with love,\" and he told his story.\n\n\"Let us look at the article,\" said d'Arthez, touched by all that\nLucien said of Coralie.\n\nLucien held out the manuscript; d'Arthez read, and could not help\nsmiling.\n\n\"Oh, what a fatal waste of intellect!\" he began. But at the sight of\nLucien overcome with grief in the opposite armchair, he checked\nhimself.\n\n\"Will you leave it with me to correct? I will let you have it again\nto-morrow,\" he went on. \"Flippancy depreciates a work; serious and\nconscientious criticism is sometimes praise in itself. I know a way to\nmake your article more honorable both for yourself and for me.\nBesides, I know my faults well enough.\"\n\n\"When you climb a hot, shadowless hillside, you sometimes find fruit\nto quench your torturing thirst; and I have found it here and now,\"\nsaid Lucien, as he sprang sobbing to d'Arthez's arms and kissed his\nfriend on the forehead. \"It seems to me that I am leaving my\nconscience in your keeping; some day I will come to you and ask for it\nagain.\"\n\n\"I look upon a periodical repentance as great hypocrisy,\" d'Arthez\nsaid solemnly; \"repentance becomes a sort of indemnity for wrongdoing.\nRepentance is virginity of the soul, which we must keep for God; a man\nwho repents twice is a horrible sycophant. I am afraid that you regard\nrepentance as absolution.\"\n\nLucien went slowly back to the Rue de la Lune, stricken dumb by those\nwords.\n\nNext morning d'Arthez sent back his article, recast throughout, and\nLucien sent it in to the review; but from that day melancholy preyed\nupon him, and he could not always disguise his mood. That evening,\nwhen the theatre was full, he experienced for the first time the\nparoxysm of nervous terror caused by a _debut_; terror aggravated in\nhis case by all the strength of his love. Vanity of every kind was\ninvolved. He looked over the rows of faces as a criminal eyes the\njudges and the jury on whom his life depends. A murmur would have set\nhim quivering; any slight incident upon the stage, Coralie's exits and\nentrances, the slightest modulation of the tones of her voice, would\nperturb him beyond all reason.\n\nThe play in which Coralie made her first appearance at the Gymnase was\na piece of the kind which sometimes falls flat at first, and\nafterwards has immense success. It fell flat that night. Coralie was\nnot applauded when she came on, and the chilly reception reacted upon\nher. The only applause came from Camusot's box, and various persons\nposted in the balcony and galleries silenced Camusot with repeated\ncries of \"Hush!\" The galleries even silenced the _claqueurs_ when they\nled off with exaggerated salvos. Martainville applauded bravely;\nNathan, Merlin, and the treacherous Florine followed his example; but\nit was clear that the piece was a failure. A crowd gathered in\nCoralie's dressing-room and consoled her, till she had no courage\nleft. She went home in despair, less for her own sake than for\nLucien's.\n\n\"Braulard has betrayed us,\" Lucien said.\n\nCoralie was heartstricken. The next day found her in a high fever,\nutterly unfit to play, face to face with the thought that she had been\ncut short in her career. Lucien hid the papers from her, and looked\nthem over in the dining-room. The reviewers one and all attributed the\nfailure of the piece to Coralie; she had overestimated her strength;\nshe might be the delight of a boulevard audience, but she was out of\nher element at the Gymnase; she had been inspired by a laudable\nambition, but she had not taken her powers into account; she had\nchosen a part to which she was quite unequal. Lucien read on through a\npile of penny-a-lining, put together on the same system as his attack\nupon Nathan. Milo of Crotona, when he found his hands fast in the oak\nwhich he himself had cleft, was not more furious than Lucien. He grew\nhaggard with rage. His friends gave Coralie the most treacherous\nadvice, in the language of kindly counsel and friendly interest. She\nshould play (according to these authorities) all kind of roles, which\nthe treacherous writers of these unblushing _feuilletons_ knew to be\nutterly unsuited to her genius. And these were the Royalist papers,\nled off by Nathan. As for the Liberal press, all the weapons which\nLucien had used were now turned against him.\n\nCoralie heard a sob, followed by another and another. She sprang out\nof bed to find Lucien, and saw the papers. Nothing would satisfy her\nbut she must read them all; and when she had read them, she went back\nto bed, and lay there in silence.\n\nFlorine was in the plot; she had foreseen the outcome; she had studied\nCoralie's part, and was ready to take her place. The management,\nunwilling to give up the piece, was ready to take Florine in Coralie's\nstead. When the manager came, he found poor Coralie sobbing and\nexhausted on her bed; but when he began to say, in Lucien's presence,\nthat Florine knew the part, and that the play must be given that\nevening, Coralie sprang up at once.\n\n\"I will play!\" she cried, and sank fainting on the floor.\n\nSo Florine took the part, and made her reputation in it; for the piece\nsucceeded, the newspapers all sang her praises, and from that time\nforth Florine was the great actress whom we all know. Florine's\nsuccess exasperated Lucien to the highest degree.\n\n\"A wretched girl, whom you helped to earn her bread! If the Gymnase\nprefers to do so, let the management pay you to cancel your\nengagement. I shall be the Comte de Rubempre; I will make my fortune,\nand you shall be my wife.\"\n\n\"What nonsense!\" said Coralie, looking at him with wan eyes.\n\n\"Nonsense!\" repeated he. \"Very well, wait a few days, and you shall\nlive in a fine house, you shall have a carriage, and I will write a\npart for you!\"\n\nHe took two thousand francs and hurried to Frascati's. For seven hours\nthe unhappy victim of the Furies watched his varying luck, and\noutwardly seemed cool and self-contained. He experienced both extremes\nof fortune during that day and part of the night that followed; at one\ntime he possessed as much as thirty thousand francs, and he came out\nat last without a sou. In the Rue de la Lune he found Finot waiting\nfor him with a request for one of his short articles. Lucien so far\nforgot himself, that he complained.\n\n\"Oh, it is not all rosy,\" returned Finot. \"You made your\nright-about-face in such a way that you were bound to lose the support\nof the Liberal press, and the Liberals are far stronger in print than\nall the Ministerialist and Royalist papers put together. A man should\nnever leave one camp for another until he has made a comfortable berth\nfor himself, by way of consolation for the losses that he must expect;\nand in any case, a prudent politician will see his friends first, and\ngive them his reasons for going over, and take their opinions. You can\nstill act together; they sympathize with you, and you agree to give\nmutual help. Nathan and Merlin did that before they went over. Hawks\ndon't pike out hawks' eyes. You were as innocent as a lamb; you will\nbe forced to show your teeth to your new party to make anything out of\nthem. You have been necessarily sacrificed to Nathan. I cannot conceal\nfrom you that your article on d'Arthez has roused a terrific hubbub.\nMarat is a saint compared with you. You will be attacked, and your\nbook will be a failure. How far have things gone with your romance?\"\n\n\"These are the last proof sheets.\"\n\n\"All the anonymous articles against that young d'Arthez in the\nMinisterialist and Ultra papers are set down to you. The _Reveil_ is\npoking fun at the set in the Rue des Quatre-Vents, and the hits are\nthe more telling because they are funny. There is a whole serious\npolitical coterie at the back of Leon Giraud's paper; they will come\ninto power too, sooner or later.\"\n\n\"I have not written a line in the _Reveil_ this week past.\"\n\n\"Very well. Keep my short articles in mind. Write fifty of them\nstraight off, and I will pay you for them in a lump; but they must be\nof the same color as the paper.\" And Finot, with seeming carelessness,\ngave Lucien an edifying anecdote of the Keeper of the Seals, a piece\nof current gossip, he said, for the subject of one of the papers.\n\nEager to retrieve his losses at play, Lucien shook off his dejection,\nsummoned up his energy and youthful force, and wrote thirty articles\nof two columns each. These finished, he went to Dauriat's, partly\nbecause he felt sure of meeting Finot there, and he wished to give the\narticles to Finot in person; partly because he wished for an\nexplanation of the non-appearance of the _Marguerites_. He found the\nbookseller's shop full of his enemies. All the talk immediately ceased\nas he entered. Put under the ban of journalism, his courage rose, and\nonce more he said to himself, as he had said in the alley at the\nLuxembourg, \"I will triumph.\"\n\nDauriat was neither amiable or inclined to patronize; he was sarcastic\nin tone, and determined not to bate an inch of his rights. The\n_Marguerites_ should appear when it suited his purpose; he should wait\nuntil Lucien was in a position to secure the success of the book; it\nwas his, he had bought it outright. When Lucien asserted that Dauriat\nwas bound to publish the _Marguerites_ by the very nature of the\ncontract, and the relative positions of the parties to the agreement,\nDauriat flatly contradicted him, said that no publisher could be\ncompelled by law to publish at a loss, and that he himself was the\nbest judge of the expediency of producing the book. There was,\nbesides, a remedy open to Lucien, as any court of law would admit--the\npoet was quite welcome to take his verses to a Royalist publisher upon\nthe repayment of the thousand crowns.\n\nLucien went away. Dauriat's moderate tone had exasperated him even\nmore than his previous arrogance at their first interview. So the\n_Marguerites_ would not appear until Lucien had found a host of\nformidable supporters, or grown formidable himself! He walked home\nslowly, so oppressed and out of heart that he felt ready for suicide.\nCoralie lay in bed, looking white and ill.\n\n\"She must have a part, or she will die,\" said Berenice, as Lucien\ndressed for a great evening party at Mlle. des Touches' house in the\nRue du Mont Blanc. Des Lupeaulx and Vignon and Blondet were to be\nthere, as well as Mme. d'Espard and Mme. de Bargeton.\n\nThe party was given in honor of Conti, the great composer, owner\nlikewise of one of the most famous voices off the stage, Cinti, Pasta,\nGarcia, Levasseur, and two or three celebrated amateurs in society not\nexcepted. Lucien saw the Marquise, her cousin, and Mme. de Montcornet\nsitting together, and made one of the party. The unhappy young fellow\nto all appearances was light-hearted, happy, and content; he jested,\nhe was the Lucien de Rubempre of his days of splendor, he would not\nseem to need help from any one. He dwelt on his services to the\nRoyalist party, and cited the hue and cry raised after him by the\nLiberal press as a proof of his zeal.\n\n\"And you will be well rewarded, my friend,\" said Mme. de Bargeton,\nwith a gracious smile. \"Go to the _Chancellerie_ the day after to-morrow\nwith 'the Heron' and des Lupeaulx, and you will find your patent\nsigned by His Majesty. The Keeper of the Seals will take it to-morrow\nto the Tuileries, but there is to be a meeting of the Council, and he\nwill not come back till late. Still, if I hear the result to-morrow\nevening, I will let you know. Where are you living?\"\n\n\"I will come to you,\" said Lucien, ashamed to confess that he was\nliving in the Rue de la Lune.\n\n\"The Duc de Lenoncourt and the Duc de Navarreins have made mention of\nyou to the King,\" added the Marquise; \"they praised your absolute and\nentire devotion, and said that some distinction ought to avenge your\ntreatment in the Liberal press. The name and title of Rubempre, to\nwhich you have a claim through your mother, would become illustrious\nthrough you, they said. The King gave his lordship instructions that\nevening to prepare a patent authorizing the Sieur Lucien Chardon to\nbear the arms and title of the Comtes de Rubempre, as grandson of the\nlast Count by the mother's side. 'Let us favor the songsters'\n(_chardonnerets_) 'of Pindus,' said his Majesty, after reading your\nsonnet on the Lily, which my cousin luckily remembered to give the\nDuke.--'Especially when the King can work miracles, and change the\nsong-bird into an eagle,' M. de Navarreins replied.\"\n\nLucien's expansion of feeling would have softened the heart of any\nwoman less deeply wounded than Louise d'Espard de Negrepelisse; but\nher thirst for vengeance was only increased by Lucien's graciousness.\nDes Lupeaulx was right; Lucien was wanting in tact. It never crossed\nhis mind that this history of the patent was one of the mystifications\nat which Mme. d'Espard was an adept. Emboldened with success and the\nflattering distinction shown to him by Mlle. des Touches, he stayed\ntill two o'clock in the morning for a word in private with his\nhostess. Lucien had learned in Royalist newspaper offices that Mlle.\ndes Touches was the author of a play in which _La petite Fay_, the\nmarvel of the moment was about to appear. As the rooms emptied, he\ndrew Mlle. des Touches to a sofa in the boudoir, and told the story of\nCoralie's misfortune and his own so touchingly, that Mlle. des Touches\npromised to give the heroine's part to his friend.\n\nThat promise put new life into Coralie. But the next day, as they\nbreakfasted together, Lucien opened Lousteau's newspaper, and found\nthat unlucky anecdote of the Keeper of the Seals and his wife. The\nstory was full of the blackest malice lurking in the most caustic wit.\nLouis XVIII. was brought into the story in a masterly fashion, and\nheld up to ridicule in such a way that prosecution was impossible.\nHere is the substance of a fiction for which the Liberal party\nattempted to win credence, though they only succeeded in adding one\nmore to the tale of their ingenious calumnies.\n\nThe King's passion for pink-scented notes and a correspondence full of\nmadrigals and sparkling wit was declared to be the last phase of the\ntender passion; love had reached the Doctrinaire stage; or had passed,\nin other words, from the concrete to the abstract. The illustrious\nlady, so cruelly ridiculed under the name of Octavie by Beranger, had\nconceived (so it was said) the gravest fears. The correspondence was\nlanguishing. The more Octavie displayed her wit, the cooler grew the\nroyal lover. At last Octavie discovered the cause of her decline; her\npower was threatened by the novelty and piquancy of a correspondence\nbetween the august scribe and the wife of his Keeper of the Seals.\nThat excellent woman was believed to be incapable of writing a note;\nshe was simply and solely godmother to the efforts of audacious\nambition. Who could be hidden behind her petticoats? Octavie decided,\nafter making observations of her own, that the King was corresponding\nwith his Minister.\n\nShe laid her plans. With the help of a faithful friend, she arranged\nthat a stormy debate should detain the Minister at the Chamber; then\nshe contrived to secure a _tete-a-tete_, and to convince outraged\nMajesty of the fraud. Louis XVIII. flew into a royal and truly Bourbon\npassion, but the tempest broke on Octavie's head. He would not believe\nher. Octavie offered immediate proof, begging the King to write a note\nwhich must be answered at once. The unlucky wife of the Keeper of the\nSeals sent to the Chamber for her husband; but precautions had been\ntaken, and at that moment the Minister was on his legs addressing the\nChamber. The lady racked her brains and replied to the note with such\nintellect as she could improvise.\n\n\"Your Chancellor will supply the rest,\" cried Octavie, laughing at the\nKing's chagrin.\n\nThere was not a word of truth in the story; but it struck home to\nthree persons--the Keeper of the Seals, his wife, and the King. It was\nsaid that des Lupeaulx had invented the tale, but Finot always kept\nhis counsel. The article was caustic and clever, the Liberal papers\nand the Orleanists were delighted with it, and Lucien himself laughed,\nand thought of it merely as a very amusing _canard_.\n\nHe called next day for des Lupeaulx and the Baron du Chatelet. The\nBaron had just been to thank his lordship. The Sieur Chatelet, newly\nappointed Councillor Extraordinary, was now Comte du Chatelet, with a\npromise of the prefecture of the Charente so soon as the present\nprefect should have completed the term of office necessary to receive\nthe maximum retiring pension. The Comte _du_ Chatelet (for the _du_ had\nbeen inserted in the patent) drove with Lucien to the _Chancellerie_,\nand treated his companion as an equal. But for Lucien's articles, he\nsaid, his patent would not have been granted so soon; Liberal\npersecution had been a stepping-stone to advancement. Des Lupeaulx was\nwaiting for them in the Secretary-General's office. That functionary\nstarted with surprise when Lucien appeared and looked at des Lupeaulx.\n\n\"What!\" he exclaimed, to Lucien's utter bewilderment. \"Do you dare to\ncome here, sir? Your patent was made out, but his lordship has torn it\nup. Here it is!\" (the Secretary-General caught up the first torn sheet\nthat came to hand). \"The Minister wished to discover the author of\nyesterday's atrocious article, and here is the manuscript,\" added the\nspeaker, holding out the sheets of Lucien's article. \"You call\nyourself a Royalist, sir, and you are on the staff of that detestable\npaper which turns the Minister's hair gray, harasses the Centre, and\nis dragging the country headlong to ruin? You breakfast on the\n_Corsair_, the _Miroir_, the _Constitutionnel_, and the _Courier_; you\ndine on the _Quotidienne_ and the _Reveil_, and then sup with\nMartainville, the worst enemy of the Government! Martainville urges the\nGovernment on to Absolutist measures; he is more likely to bring on\nanother Revolution than if he had gone over to the extreme Left. You are\na very clever journalist, but you will never make a politician. The\nMinister denounced you to the King, and the King was so angry that he\nscolded M. le Duc de Navarreins, his First Gentleman of the Bedchamber.\nYour enemies will be all the more formidable because they have hitherto\nbeen your friends. Conduct that one expects from an enemy is atrocious\nin a friend.\"\n\n\"Why, really, my dear fellow, are you a child?\" said des Lupeaulx.\n\"You have compromised me. Mme. d'Espard, Mme. de Bargeton, and Mme. de\nMontcornet, who were responsible for you, must be furious. The Duke is\nsure to have handed on his annoyance to the Marquise, and the Marquise\nwill have scolded her cousin. Keep away from them and wait.\"\n\n\"Here comes his lordship--go!\" said the Secretary-General.\n\nLucien went out into the Place Vendome; he was stunned by this\nbludgeon blow. He walked home along the Boulevards trying to think\nover his position. He saw himself a plaything in the hands of envy,\ntreachery, and greed. What was he in this world of contending\nambitions? A child sacrificing everything to the pursuit of pleasure\nand the gratification of vanity; a poet whose thoughts never went\nbeyond the moment, a moth flitting from one bright gleaming object to\nanother. He had no definite aim; he was the slave of circumstance\n--meaning well, doing ill. Conscience tortured him remorselessly. And\nto crown it all, he was penniless and exhausted with work and emotion.\nHis articles could not compare with Merlin's or Nathan's work.\n\nHe walked at random, absorbed in these thoughts. As he passed some of\nthe reading-rooms which were already lending books as well as\nnewspapers, a placard caught his eyes. It was an advertisement of a\nbook with a grotesque title, but beneath the announcement he saw his\nname in brilliant letters--\"By Lucien Chardon de Rubempre.\" So his\nbook had come out, and he had heard nothing of it! All the newspapers\nwere silent. He stood motionless before the placard, his arms hanging\nat his sides. He did not notice a little knot of acquaintances\n--Rastignac and de Marsay and some other fashionable young men; nor did\nhe see that Michel Chrestien and Leon Giraud were coming towards him.\n\n\"Are you M. Chardon?\" It was Michel who spoke, and there was that in\nthe sound of his voice that set Lucien's heartstrings vibrating.\n\n\"Do you not know me?\" he asked, turning very pale.\n\nMichel spat in his face.\n\n\"Take that as your wages for your article against d'Arthez. If\neverybody would do as I do on his own or his friend's behalf, the\npress would be as it ought to be--a self-respecting and respected\npriesthood.\"\n\nLucien staggered back and caught hold of Rastignac.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" he said, addressing Rastignac and de Marsay, \"you will\nnot refuse to act as my seconds. But first, I wish to make matters\neven and apology impossible.\"\n\nHe struck Michel a sudden, unexpected blow in the face. The rest\nrushed in between the Republican and Royalist, to prevent a street\nbrawl. Rastignac dragged Lucien off to the Rue Taitbout, only a few\nsteps away from the Boulevard de Gand, where this scene took place. It\nwas the hour of dinner, or a crowd would have assembled at once. De\nMarsay came to find Lucien, and the pair insisted that he should dine\nwith them at the Cafe Anglais, where they drank and made merry.\n\n\"Are you a good swordsman?\" inquired de Marsay.\n\n\"I have never had a foil in my hands.\"\n\n\"A good shot?\"\n\n\"Never fired a pistol in my life.\"\n\n\"Then you have luck on your side. You are a formidable antagonist to\nstand up to; you may kill your man,\" said de Marsay.\n\nFortunately, Lucien found Coralie in bed and asleep.\n\nShe had played without rehearsal in a one-act play, and taken her\nrevenge. She had met with genuine applause. Her enemies had not been\nprepared for this step on her part, and her success had determined the\nmanager to give her the heroine's part in Camille Maupin's play. He\nhad discovered the cause of her apparent failure, and was indignant\nwith Florine and Nathan. Coralie should have the protection of the\nmanagement.\n\nAt five o'clock that morning, Rastignac came for Lucien.\n\n\"The name of your street my dear fellow, is particularly appropriate\nfor your lodgings; you are up in the sky,\" he said, by way of\ngreeting. \"Let us be first upon the ground on the road to\nClignancourt; it is good form, and we ought to set them an example.\"\n\n\"Here is the programme,\" said de Marsay, as the cab rattled through\nthe Faubourg Saint-Denis: \"You stand up at twenty-five paces, coming\nnearer, till you are only fifteen apart. You have, each of you, five\npaces to take and three shots to fire--no more. Whatever happens, that\nmust be the end of it. We load for your antagonist, and his seconds\nload for you. The weapons were chosen by the four seconds at a\ngunmaker's. We helped you to a chance, I will promise you; horse\npistols are to be the weapons.\"\n\nFor Lucien, life had become a bad dream. He did not care whether he\nlived or died. The courage of suicide helped him in some sort to carry\nthings off with a dash of bravado before the spectators. He stood in\nhis place; he would not take a step, a piece of recklessness which the\nothers took for deliberate calculation. They thought the poet an\nuncommonly cool hand. Michel Chrestien came as far as his limit; both\nfired twice and at the same time, for either party was considered to\nbe equally insulted. Michel's first bullet grazed Lucien's chin;\nLucien's passed ten feet above Chrestien's head. The second shot hit\nLucien's coat collar, but the buckram lining fortunately saved its\nwearer. The third bullet struck him in the chest, and he dropped.\n\n\"Is he dead?\" asked Michel Chrestien.\n\n\"No,\" said the surgeon, \"he will pull through.\"\n\n\"So much the worse,\" answered Michel.\n\n\"Yes; so much the worse,\" said Lucien, as his tears fell fast.\n\nBy noon the unhappy boy lay in bed in his own room. With untold pains\nthey had managed to remove him, but it had taken five hours to bring\nhim to the Rue de la Lune. His condition was not dangerous, but\nprecautions were necessary lest fever should set in and bring about\ntroublesome complications. Coralie choked down her grief and anguish.\nShe sat up with him at night through the anxious weeks of his illness,\nstudying her parts by his bedside. Lucien was in danger for two long\nmonths; and often at the theatre Coralie acted her frivolous role with\none thought in her heart, \"Perhaps he is dying at this moment.\"\n\nLucien owed his life to the skill and devotion of a friend whom he had\ngrievously hurt. Bianchon had come to tend him after hearing the story\nof the attack from d'Arthez, who told it in confidence, and excused\nthe unhappy poet. Bianchon suspected that d'Arthez was generously\ntrying to screen the renegade; but on questioning Lucien during a\nlucid interval in the dangerous nervous fever, he learned that his\npatient was only responsible for the one serious article in Hector\nMerlin's paper.\n\nBefore the first month was out, the firm of Fendant and Cavalier filed\ntheir schedule. Bianchon told Coralie that Lucien must on no account\nhear the news. The famous _Archer of Charles IX._, brought out with an\nabsurd title, had been a complete failure. Fendant, being anxious to\nrealize a little ready money before going into bankruptcy, had sold\nthe whole edition (without Cavalier's knowledge) to dealers in printed\npaper. These, in their turn, had disposed of it at a cheap rate to\nhawkers, and Lucien's book at that moment was adorning the bookstalls\nalong the Quays. The booksellers on the Quai des Augustins, who had\npreviously taken a quantity of copies, now discovered that after this\nsudden reduction of the price they were like to lose heavily on their\npurchases; the four duodecimo volumes, for which they had paid four\nfrancs fifty centimes, were being given away for fifty sous. Great was\nthe outcry in the trade; but the newspapers preserved a profound\nsilence. Barbet had not foreseen this \"clearance;\" he had a belief in\nLucien's abilities; for once he had broken his rule and taken two\nhundred copies. The prospect of a loss drove him frantic; the things\nhe said of Lucien were fearful to hear. Then Barbet took a heroic\nresolution. He stocked his copies in a corner of his shop, with the\nobstinacy of greed, and left his competitors to sell their wares at a\nloss. Two years afterwards, when d'Arthez's fine preface, the merits\nof the book, and one or two articles by Leon Giraud had raised the\nvalue of the book, Barbet sold his copies, one by one, at ten francs\neach.\n\nLucien knew nothing of all this, but Berenice and Coralie could not\nrefuse to allow Hector Merlin to see his dying comrade, and Hector\nMerlin made him drink, drop by drop, the whole of the bitter draught\nbrewed by the failure of Fendant and Cavalier, made bankrupts by his\nfirst ill-fated book. Martainville, the one friend who stood by Lucien\nthrough thick and thin, had written a magnificent article on his work;\nbut so great was the general exasperation against the editor of\n_L'Aristarque_, _L'Oriflamme_, and _Le Drapeau Blanc_, that his\nchampionship only injured Lucien. In vain did the athlete return the\nLiberal insults tenfold, not a newspaper took up the challenge in\nspite of all his attacks.\n\nCoralie, Berenice, and Bianchon might shut the door on Lucien's\nso-called friends, who raised a great outcry, but it was impossible\nto keep out creditors and writs. After the failure of Fendant and\nCavalier, their bills were taken into bankruptcy according to that\nprovision of the Code of Commerce most inimical to the claims of third\nparties, who in this way lose the benefit of delay.\n\nLucien discovered that Camusot was proceeding against him with great\nenergy. When Coralie heard the name, and for the first time learned\nthe dreadful and humiliating step which her poet had taken for her\nsake, the angelic creature loved him ten times more than before, and\nwould not approach Camusot. The bailiff bringing the warrant of arrest\nshrank back from the idea of dragging his prisoner out of bed, and\nwent back to Camusot before applying to the President of the Tribunal\nof Commerce for an order to remove the debtor to a private hospital.\nCamusot hurried at once to the Rue de la Lune, and Coralie went down\nto him.\n\nWhen she came up again she held the warrants, in which Lucien was\ndescribed as a tradesman, in her hand. How had she obtained those\npapers from Camusot? What promise had she given? Coralie kept a sad,\ngloomy silence, but when she returned she looked as if all the life\nhad gone out of her. She played in Camille Maupin's play, and\ncontributed not a little to the success of that illustrious literary\nhermaphrodite; but the creation of this character was the last flicker\nof a bright, dying lamp. On the twentieth night, when Lucien had so\nfar recovered that he had regained his appetite and could walk abroad,\nand talked of getting to work again, Coralie broke down; a secret\ntrouble was weighing upon her. Berenice always believed that she had\npromised to go back to Camusot to save Lucien.\n\nAnother mortification followed. Coralie was obliged to see her part\ngiven to Florine. Nathan had threatened the Gymnase with war if the\nmanagement refused to give the vacant place to Coralie's rival.\nCoralie had persisted till she could play no longer, knowing that\nFlorine was waiting to step into her place. She had overtasked her\nstrength. The Gymnase had advanced sums during Lucien's illness, she\nhad no money to draw; Lucien, eager to work though he was, was not yet\nstrong enough to write, and he helped besides to nurse Coralie and to\nrelieve Berenice. From poverty they had come to utter distress; but in\nBianchon they found a skilful and devoted doctor, who obtained credit\nfor them of the druggist. The landlord of the house and the\ntradespeople knew by this time how matters stood. The furniture was\nattached. The tailor and dressmaker no longer stood in awe of the\njournalist, and proceeded to extremes; and at last no one, with the\nexception of the pork-butcher and the druggist, gave the two unlucky\nchildren credit. For a week or more all three of them--Lucien,\nBerenice, and the invalid--were obliged to live on the various\ningenious preparations sold by the pork-butcher; the inflammatory diet\nwas little suited to the sick girl, and Coralie grew worse. Sheer want\ncompelled Lucien to ask Lousteau for a return of the loan of a\nthousand francs lost at play by the friend who had deserted him in his\nhour of need. Perhaps, amid all his troubles, this step cost him most\ncruel suffering.\n\nLousteau was not to be found in the Rue de la Harpe. Hunted down like\na hare, he was lodging now with this friend, now with that. Lucien\nfound him at last at Flicoteaux's; he was sitting at the very table at\nwhich Lucien had found him that evening when, for his misfortune, he\nforsook d'Arthez for journalism. Lousteau offered him dinner, and\nLucien accepted the offer.\n\nAs they came out of Flicoteaux's with Claude Vignon (who happened to\nbe dining there that day) and the great man in obscurity, who kept his\nwardrobe at Samanon's, the four among them could not produce enough\nspecie to pay for a cup of coffee at the Cafe Voltaire. They lounged\nabout the Luxembourg in the hope of meeting with a publisher; and, as\nit fell out, they met with one of the most famous printers of the day.\nLousteau borrowed forty francs of him, and divided the money into four\nequal parts.\n\nMisery had brought down Lucien's pride and extinguished sentiment; he\nshed tears as he told the story of his troubles, but each one of his\ncomrades had a tale as cruel as his own; and when the three versions\nhad been given, it seemed to the poet that he was the least\nunfortunate among the four. All of them craved a respite from\nremembrance and thoughts which made trouble doubly hard to bear.\n\nLousteau hurried to the Palais Royal to gamble with his remaining nine\nfrancs. The great man unknown to fame, though he had a divine\nmistress, must needs hie him to a low haunt of vice to wallow in\nperilous pleasure. Vignon betook himself to the _Rocher de Cancale_ to\ndrown memory and thought in a couple of bottles of Bordeaux; Lucien\nparted company with him on the threshold, declining to share that\nsupper. When he shook hands with the one journalist who had not been\nhostile to him, it was with a cruel pang in his heart.\n\n\"What shall I do?\" he asked aloud.\n\n\"One must do as one can,\" the great critic said. \"Your book is good,\nbut it excited jealousy, and your struggle will be hard and long.\nGenius is a cruel disease. Every writer carries a canker in his heart,\na devouring monster, like the tapeworm in the stomach, which destroys\nall feeling as it arises in him. Which is the stronger? The man or the\ndisease? One has need be a great man, truly, to keep the balance\nbetween genius and character. The talent grows, the heart withers.\nUnless a man is a giant, unless he has the thews of a Hercules, he\nmust be content either to lose his gift or to live without a heart.\nYou are slender and fragile, you will give way,\" he added, as he\nturned into the restaurant.\n\nLucien returned home, thinking over that terrible verdict. He beheld\nthe life of literature by the light of the profound truths uttered by\nVignon.\n\n\"Money! money!\" a voice cried in his ears.\n\nThen he drew three bills of a thousand francs each, due respectively\nin one, two, and three months, imitating the handwriting of his\nbrother-in-law, David Sechard, with admirable skill. He endorsed the\nbills, and took them next morning to Metivier, the paper-dealer in the\nRue Serpente, who made no difficulty about taking them. Lucien wrote a\nfew lines to give his brother-in-law notice of this assault upon his\ncash-box, promising, as usual in such cases, to be ready to meet the\nbills as they fell due.\n\nWhen all debts, his own and Coralie's, were paid, he put the three\nhundred francs which remained into Berenice's hands, bidding her to\nrefuse him money if he asked her for it. He was afraid of a return of\nthe gambler's frenzy. Lucien worked away gloomily in a sort of cold,\nspeechless fury, putting forth all his powers into witty articles,\nwritten by the light of the lamp at Coralie's bedside. Whenever he\nlooked up in search of ideas, his eyes fell on that beloved face,\nwhite as porcelain, fair with the beauty that belongs to the dying,\nand he saw a smile on her pale lips, and her eyes, grown bright with a\nmore consuming pain than physical suffering, always turned on his\nface.\n\nLucien sent in his work, but he could not leave the house to worry\neditors, and his articles did not appear. When he at last made up his\nmind to go to the office, he met with a cool reception from Theodore\nGaillard, who had advanced him money, and turned his literary diamonds\nto good account afterwards.\n\n\"Take care, my dear fellow, you are falling off,\" he said. \"You must\nnot let yourself down, your work wants inspiration!\"\n\n\"That little Lucien has written himself out with his romance and his\nfirst articles,\" cried Felicien Vernou, Merlin, and the whole chorus\nof his enemies, whenever his name came up at Dauriat's or the\nVaudeville. \"The work he is sending us is pitiable.\"\n\n\"To have written oneself out\" (in the slang of journalism), is a\nverdict very hard to live down. It passed everywhere from mouth to\nmouth, ruining Lucien, all unsuspicious as he was. And, indeed, his\nburdens were too heavy for his strength. In the midst of a heavy\nstrain of work, he was sued for the bills which he had drawn in David\nSechard's name. He had recourse to Camusot's experience, and Coralie's\nsometime adorer was generous enough to assist the man she loved. The\nintolerable situation lasted for two whole months; the days being\ndiversified by stamped papers handed over to Desroches, a friend of\nBixiou, Blondet, and des Lupeaulx.\n\nEarly in August, Bianchon told them that Coralie's condition was\nhopeless--she had only a few days to live. Those days were spent in\ntears by Berenice and Lucien; they could not hide their grief from the\ndying girl, and she was broken-hearted for Lucien's sake.\n\nSome strange change was working in Coralie. She would have Lucien\nbring a priest; she must be reconciled to the Church and die in peace.\nCoralie died as a Christian; her repentance was sincere. Her agony and\ndeath took all energy and heart out of Lucien. He sank into a low\nchair at the foot of the bed, and never took his eyes off her till\nDeath brought the end of her suffering. It was five o'clock in the\nmorning. Some singing-bird lighting upon a flower-pot on the\nwindow-sill, twittered a few notes. Berenice, kneeling by the bedside,\nwas covering a hand fast growing cold with kisses and tears. On the\nchimney-piece there lay eleven sous.\n\nLucien went out. Despair made him beg for money to lay Coralie in her\ngrave. He had wild thoughts of flinging himself at the Marquise\nd'Espard's feet, of entreating the Comte du Chatelet, Mme. de\nBargeton, Mlle. des Touches, nay, that terrible dandy of a de Marsay.\nAll his pride had gone with his strength. He would have enlisted as a\ncommon soldier at that moment for money. He walked on with a\nslouching, feverish gait known to all the unhappy, reached Camille\nMaupin's house, entered, careless of his disordered dress, and sent in\na message. He entreated Mlle. des Touches to see him for a moment.\n\n\"Mademoiselle only went to bed at three o'clock this morning,\" said\nthe servant, \"and no one would dare to disturb her until she rings.\"\n\n\"When does she ring?\"\n\n\"Never before ten o'clock.\"\n\nThen Lucien wrote one of those harrowing appeals in which the\nwell-dressed beggar flings all pride and self-respect to the winds.\nOne evening, not so very long ago, when Lousteau had told him of the\nabject begging letters which Finot received, Lucien had thought it\nimpossible that any creature would sink so low; and now, carried away\nby his pen, he had gone further, it may be, than other unlucky\nwretches upon the same road. He did not suspect, in his fever and\nimbecility, that he had just written a masterpiece of pathos. On his\nway home along the Boulevards, he met Barbet.\n\n\"Barbet!\" he begged, holding out his hand. \"Five hundred francs!\"\n\n\"No. Two hundred,\" returned the other.\n\n\"Ah! then you have a heart.\"\n\n\"Yes; but I am a man of business as well. I have lost a lot of money\nthrough you,\" he concluded, after giving the history of the failure of\nFendant and Cavalier, \"will you put me in the way of making some?\"\n\nLucien quivered.\n\n\"You are a poet. You ought to understand all kinds of poetry,\"\ncontinued the little publisher. \"I want a few rollicking songs at this\nmoment to put along with some more by different authors, or they will\nbe down upon me over the copyright. I want to have a good collection\nto sell on the streets at ten sous. If you care to let me have ten\ngood drinking-songs by to-morrow morning, or something spicy,--you\nknow the sort of thing, eh!--I will pay you two hundred francs.\"\n\nWhen Lucien returned home, he found Coralie stretched out straight and\nstiff on a pallet-bed; Berenice, with many tears, had wrapped her in a\ncoarse linen sheet, and put lighted candles at the four corners of the\nbed. Coralie's face had taken that strange, delicate beauty of death\nwhich so vividly impresses the living with the idea of absolute calm;\nshe looked like some white girl in a decline; it seemed as if those\npale, crimson lips must open and murmur the name which had blended\nwith the name of God in the last words that she uttered before she\ndied.\n\nLucien told Berenice to order a funeral which should not cost more\nthan two hundred francs, including the service at the shabby little\nchurch of the Bonne-Nouvelle. As soon as she had gone out, he sat down\nto a table, and beside the dead body of his love he composed ten\nrollicking songs to fit popular airs. The effort cost him untold\nanguish, but at last the brain began to work at the bidding of\nNecessity, as if suffering were not; and already Lucien had learned to\nput Claude Vignon's terrible maxims in practice, and to raise a\nbarrier between heart and brain. What a night the poor boy spent over\nthose drinking songs, writing by the light of the tall wax candles\nwhile the priest recited the prayers for the dead!\n\nMorning broke before the last song was finished. Lucien tried it over\nto a street-song of the day, to the consternation of Berenice and the\npriest, who thought that he was mad:--\n\n\n    Lads, 'tis tedious waste of time\n      To mingle song and reason;\n    Folly calls for laughing rhyme,\n      Sense is out of season.\n  Let Apollo be forgot\n    When Bacchus fills the drinking-cup;\n  Any catch is good, I wot,\n    If good fellows take it up.\n      Let philosophers protest,\n        Let us laugh,\n          And quaff,\n      And a fig for the rest!\n\n    As Hippocrates has said,\n      Every jolly fellow,\n    When a century has sped,\n      Still is fit and mellow.\n  No more following of a lass\n    With the palsy in your legs?\n  --While your hand can hold a glass,\n    You can drain it to the dregs,\n      With an undiminished zest.\n        Let us laugh,\n          And quaff,\n      And a fig for the rest!\n\n    Whence we come we know full well.\n      Whiter are we going?\n    Ne'er a one of us can tell,\n      'Tis a thing past knowing.\n  Faith! what does it signify,\n    Take the good that Heaven sends;\n  It is certain that we die,\n    Certain that we live, my friends.\n      Life is nothing but a jest.\n        Let us laugh,\n          And quaff,\n      And a fig for the rest!\n\n\nHe was shouting the reckless refrain when d'Arthez and Bianchon\narrived, to find him in a paroxysm of despair and exhaustion, utterly\nunable to make a fair copy of his verses. A torrent of tears followed;\nand when, amid his sobs, he had told his story, he saw the tears\nstanding in his friends' eyes.\n\n\"This wipes out many sins,\" said d'Arthez.\n\n\"Happy are they who suffer for their sins in this world,\" the priest\nsaid solemnly.\n\nAt the sight of the fair, dead face smiling at Eternity, while\nCoralie's lover wrote tavern-catches to buy a grave for her, and\nBarbet paid for the coffin--of the four candles lighted about the dead\nbody of her who had thrilled a great audience as she stood behind the\nfootlights in her Spanish basquina and scarlet green-clocked\nstockings; while beyond in the doorway, stood the priest who had\nreconciled the dying actress with God, now about to return to the\nchurch to say a mass for the soul of her who had \"loved much,\"--all\nthe grandeur and the sordid aspects of the scene, all that sorrow\ncrushed under by Necessity, froze the blood of the great writer and\nthe great doctor. They sat down; neither of them could utter a word.\n\nJust at that moment a servant in livery announced Mlle. des Touches.\nThat beautiful and noble woman understood everything at once. She\nstepped quickly across the room to Lucien, and slipped two\nthousand-franc notes into his hand as she grasped it.\n\n\"It is too late,\" he said, looking up at her with dull, hopeless eyes.\n\nThe three stayed with Lucien, trying to soothe his despair with\ncomforting words; but every spring seemed to be broken. At noon all\nthe brotherhood, with the exception of Michel Chrestien (who, however,\nhad learned the truth as to Lucien's treachery), was assembled in the\npoor little church of the Bonne-Nouvelle; Mlle. de Touches was\npresent, and Berenice and Coralie's dresser from the theatre, with a\ncouple of supernumeraries and the disconsolate Camusot. All the men\naccompanied the actress to her last resting-place in Pere Lachaise.\nCamusot, shedding hot tears, had solemnly promised Lucien to buy the\ngrave in perpetuity, and to put a headstone above it with the words:\n\n\n                               CORALIE\n\n                         AGED NINETEEN YEARS\n\n                             August, 1822\n\n\nLucien stayed there, on the sloping ground that looks out over Paris,\nuntil the sun had set.\n\n\"Who will love me now?\" he thought. \"My truest friends despise me.\nWhatever I might have done, she who lies here would have thought me\nwholly noble and good. I have no one left to me now but my sister and\nmother and David. And what do they think of me at home?\"\n\nPoor distinguished provincial! He went back to the Rue de la Lune; but\nthe sight of the rooms was so acutely painful, that he could not stay\nin them, and he took a cheap lodging elsewhere in the same street.\nMlle. des Touches' two thousand francs and the sale of the furniture\npaid the debts.\n\nBerenice had two hundred francs left, on which they lived for two\nmonths. Lucien was prostrate; he could neither write nor think; he\ngave way to morbid grief. Berenice took pity upon him.\n\n\"Suppose that you were to go back to your own country, how are you to\nget there?\" she asked one day, by way of reply to an exclamation of\nLucien's.\n\n\"On foot.\"\n\n\"But even so, you must live and sleep on the way. Even if you walk\ntwelve leagues a day, you will want twenty francs at least.\"\n\n\"I will get them together,\" he said.\n\nHe took his clothes and his best linen, keeping nothing but strict\nnecessaries, and went to Samanon, who offered fifty francs for his\nentire wardrobe. In vain he begged the money-lender to let him have\nenough to pay his fare by the coach; Samanon was inexorable. In a\nparoxysm of fury, Lucien rushed to Frascati's, staked the proceeds of\nthe sale, and lost every farthing. Back once more in the wretched room\nin the Rue de la Lune, he asked Berenice for Coralie's shawl. The good\ngirl looked at him, and knew in a moment what he meant to do. He had\nconfessed to his loss at the gaming-table; and now he was going to\nhang himself.\n\n\"Are you mad, sir? Go out for a walk, and come back again at midnight.\nI will get the money for you; but keep to the Boulevards, do not go\ntowards the Quais.\"\n\nLucien paced up and down the Boulevards. He was stupid with grief. He\nwatched the passers-by and the stream of traffic, and felt that he was\nalone, and a very small atom in this seething whirlpool of Paris,\nchurned by the strife of innumerable interests. His thoughts went back\nto the banks of his Charente; a craving for happiness and home awoke\nin him; and with the craving, came one of the sudden febrile bursts of\nenergy which half-feminine natures like his mistake for strength. He\nwould not give up until he had poured out his heart to David Sechard,\nand taken counsel of the three good angels still left to him on earth.\n\nAs he lounged along, he caught sight of Berenice--Berenice in her\nSunday clothes, speaking to a stranger at the corner of the Rue de la\nLune and the filthy Boulevard Bonne-Nouvelle, where she had taken her\nstand.\n\n\"What are you doing?\" asked Lucien, dismayed by a sudden suspicion.\n\n\"Here are your twenty francs,\" said the girl, slipping four five-franc\npieces into the poet's hand. \"They may cost dear yet; but you can go,\"\nand she had fled before Lucien could see the way she went; for, in\njustice to him, it must be said that the money burned his hand, he\nwanted to return it, but he was forced to keep it as the final brand\nset upon him by life in Paris.\n\n\n\n\nADDENDUM\n\nThe following personages appear in other stories of the Human Comedy.\n\nBarbet\n  A Man of Business\n  The Seamy Side of History\n  The Middle Classes\n\nBeaudenord, Godefroid de\n  The Ball at Sceaux\n  The Firm of Nucingen\n\nBerenice\n  Lost Illusions\n\nBianchon, Horace\n  Father Goriot\n  The Atheist's Mass\n  Cesar Birotteau\n  The Commission in Lunacy\n  Lost Illusions\n  A Bachelor's Establishment\n  The Secrets of a Princess\n  The Government Clerks\n  Pierrette\n  A Study of Woman\n  Scenes from a Courtesan's Life\n  Honorine\n  The Seamy Side of History\n  The Magic Skin\n  A Second Home\n  A Prince of Bohemia\n  Letters of Two Brides\n  The Muse of the Department\n  The Imaginary Mistress\n  The Middle Classes\n  Cousin Betty\n  The Country Parson\nIn addition, M.

and\nintelligence of the ox which painters give the Evangelist for\naccompanying symbol, set himself to make the large fortune for which\nhe had wished that evening down by the Charente, when he sat with Eve\nby the weir, and she gave him her hand and her heart. He wanted to\nmake the money quickly, and less for himself than for Eve's sake and\nLucien's. He would place his wife amid the elegant and comfortable\nsurroundings that were hers by right, and his strong arm should\nsustain her brother's ambitions--this was the programme that he saw\nbefore his eyes in letters of fire.\n\nJournalism and politics, the immense development of the book trade, of\nliterature and of the sciences; the increase of public interest in\nmatters touching the various industries in the country; in fact, the\nwhole social tendency of the epoch following the establishment of the\nRestoration produced an enormous increase in the demand for paper. The\nsupply required was almost ten times as large as the quantity in which\nthe celebrated Ouvrard speculated at the outset of the Revolution.\nThen Ouvrard could buy up first the entire stock of paper and then the\nmanufacturers; but in the year 1821 there were so many paper-mills in\nFrance, that no one could hope to repeat his success; and David had\nneither audacity enough nor capital enough for such speculation.\nMachinery for producing paper in any length was just coming into use\nin England. It was one of the most urgent needs of the time,\ntherefore, that the paper trade should keep pace with the requirements\nof the French system of civil government, a system by which the right\nof discussion was to be extended to every man, and the whole fabric\nbased upon continual expression of individual opinion; a grave\nmisfortune, for the nation that deliberates is but little wont to act.\n\nSo, strange coincidence! while Lucien was drawn into the great\nmachinery of journalism, where he was like to leave his honor and his\nintelligence torn to shreds, David Sechard, at the back of his\nprinting-house, foresaw all the practical consequences of the\nincreased activity of the periodical press. He saw the direction in\nwhich the spirit of the age was tending, and sought to find means to\nthe required end. He saw also that there was a fortune awaiting the\ndiscoverer of cheap paper, and the event has justified his\nclearsightedness. Within the last fifteen years, the Patent Office has\nreceived more than a hundred applications from persons claiming to\nhave discovered cheap substances to be employed in the manufacture of\npaper. David felt more than ever convinced that this would be no\nbrilliant triumph, it is true, but a useful and immensely profitable\ndiscovery; and after his brother-in-law went to Paris, he became more\nand more absorbed in the problem which he had set himself to solve.\n\nThe expenses of his marriage and of Lucien's journey to Paris had\nexhausted all his resources; he confronted the extreme of poverty at\nthe very outset of married life. He had kept one thousand francs for\nthe working expenses of the business, and owed a like sum, for which\nhe had given a bill to Postel the druggist. So here was a double\nproblem for this deep thinker; he must invent a method of making cheap\npaper, and that quickly; he must make the discovery, in fact, in order\nto apply the proceeds to the needs of the household and of the\nbusiness. What words can describe the brain that can forget the cruel\npreoccupations caused by hidden want, by the daily needs of a family\nand the daily drudgery of a printer's business, which requires such\nminute, painstaking care; and soar, with the enthusiasm and\nintoxication of the man of science, into the regions of the unknown in\nquest of a secret which daily eludes the most subtle experiment? And\nthe inventor, alas! as will shortly be seen, has plenty of woes to\nendure, besides the ingratitude of the many; idle folk that can do\nnothing themselves tell them, \"Such a one is a born inventor; he could\nnot do otherwise. He no more deserves credit for his invention than a\nprince for being born to rule! He is simply exercising his natural\nfaculties, and his work is its own reward,\" and the people believe\nthem.\n\nMarriage brings profound mental and physical perturbations into a\ngirl's life; and if she marries under the ordinary conditions of lower\nmiddle-class life, she must moreover begin to study totally new\ninterests and initiate herself in the intricacies of business. With\nmarriage, therefore, she enters upon a phase of her existence when she\nis necessarily on the watch before she can act. Unfortunately, David's\nlove for his wife retarded this training; he dared not tell her the\nreal state of affairs on the day after their wedding, nor for some\ntime afterwards. His father's avarice condemned him to the most\ngrinding poverty, but he could not bring himself to spoil the\nhoneymoon by beginning his wife's commercial education and prosaic\napprenticeship to his laborious craft. So it came to pass that\nhousekeeping, no less than working expenses, ate up the thousand\nfrancs, his whole fortune. For four months David gave no thought to\nthe future, and his wife remained in ignorance. The awakening was\nterrible! Postel's bill fell due; there was no money to meet it, and\nEve knew enough of the debt and its cause to give up her bridal\ntrinkets and silver.\n\nThat evening Eve tried to induce David to talk of their affairs, for\nshe had noticed that he was giving less attention to the business and\nmore to the problem of which he had once spoken to her. Since the\nfirst few weeks of married life, in fact, David spent most of his time\nin the shed in the backyard, in the little room where he was wont to\nmould his ink-rollers. Three months after his return to Angouleme, he\nhad replaced the old fashioned round ink-balls by rollers made of\nstrong glue and treacle, and an ink-table, on which the ink was evenly\ndistributed, an improvement so obvious that Cointet Brothers no sooner\nsaw it than they adopted the plan themselves.\n\nBy the partition wall of this kitchen, as it were, David had set up a\nlittle furnace with a copper pan, ostensibly to save the cost of fuel\nover the recasting of his rollers, though the moulds had not been used\ntwice, and hung there rusting upon the wall. Nor was this all; a solid\noak door had been put in by his orders, and the walls were lined with\nsheet-iron; he even replaced the dirty window sash by panes of ribbed\nglass, so that no one without could watch him at his work.\n\nWhen Eve began to speak about the future, he looked uneasily at her,\nand cut her short at the first word by saying, \"I know all that you\nmust think, child, when you see that the workshop is left to itself,\nand that I am dead, as it were, to all business interests; but see,\"\nhe continued, bringing her to the window, and pointing to the\nmysterious shed, \"there lies our fortune. For some months yet we must\nendure our lot, but let us bear it patiently; leave me to solve the\nproblem of which I told you, and all our troubles will be at an end.\"\n\nDavid was so good, his devotion was so thoroughly to be taken upon his\nword, that the poor wife, with a wife's anxiety as to daily expenses,\ndetermined to spare her husband the household cares and to take the\nburden upon herself. So she came down from the pretty blue-and-white\nroom, where she sewed and talked contentedly with her mother, took\npossession of one of the two dens at the back of the printing-room,\nand set herself to learn the business routine of typography. Was it\nnot heroism in a wife who expected ere long to be a mother?\n\nDuring the past few months David's workmen had left him one by one;\nthere was not enough work for them to do. Cointet Brothers, on the\nother hand, were overwhelmed with orders; they were employing all the\nworkmen of the department; the alluring prospect of high wages even\nbrought them a few from Bordeaux, more especially apprentices, who\nthought themselves sufficiently expert to cancel their articles and go\nelsewhere. When Eve came to look into the affairs of Sechard's\nprinting works, she discovered that he employed three persons in all.\n\nFirst in order stood Cerizet, an apprentice of Didot's, whom David had\nchosen to train. Most foremen have some one favorite among the great\nnumbers of workers under them, and David had brought Cerizet to\nAngouleme, where he had been learning more of the business. Marion, as\nmuch attached to the house as a watch-dog, was the second; and the\nthird was Kolb, an Alsacien, at one time a porter in the employ of the\nMessrs. Didot. Kolb had been drawn for military service, chance\nbrought him to Angouleme, and David recognized the man's face at a\nreview just as his time was about to expire. Kolb came to see David,\nand was smitten forthwith by the charms of the portly Marion; she\npossessed all the qualities which a man of his class looks for in a\nwife--the robust health that bronzes the cheeks, the strength of a man\n(Marion could lift a form of type with ease), the scrupulous honesty\non which an Alsacien sets such store, the faithful service which\nbespeaks a sterling character, and finally, the thrift which had saved\na little sum of a thousand francs, besides a stock of clothing and\nlinen, neat and clean, as country linen can be. Marion herself, a big,\nstout woman of thirty-six, felt sufficiently flattered by the\nadmiration of a cuirassier, who stood five feet seven in his\nstockings, a well-built warrior, strong as a bastion, and not\nunnaturally suggested that he should become a printer. So, by the time\nKolb received his full discharge, Marion and David between them had\ntransformed him into a tolerably creditable \"bear,\" though their pupil\ncould neither read nor write.\n\nJob printing, as it is called, was not so abundant at this season but\nthat Cerizet could manage it without help. Cerizet, compositor,\nclicker, and foreman, realized in his person the \"phenomenal\ntriplicity\" of Kant; he set up type, read proof, took orders, and made\nout invoices; but the most part of the time he had nothing to do, and\nused to read novels in his den at the back of the workshop while he\nwaited for an order for a bill-head or a trade circular. Marion,\ntrained by old Sechard, prepared and wetted down the paper, helped\nKolb with the printing, hung the sheets to dry, and cut them to size;\nyet cooked the dinner, none the less, and did her marketing very early\nof a morning.\n\nEve told Cerizet to draw out a balance-sheet for the last six months,\nand found that the gross receipts amounted to eight hundred francs. On\nthe other hand, wages at the rate of three francs per day--two francs\nto Cerizet, and one to Kolb--reached a total of six hundred francs;\nand as the goods supplied for the work printed and delivered amounted\nto some hundred odd francs, it was clear to Eve that David had been\ncarrying on business at a loss during the first half-year of their\nmarried life. There was nothing to show for rent, nothing for Marion's\nwages, nor for the interest on capital represented by the plant, the\nlicense, and the ink; nothing, finally, by way of allowance for the\nhost of things included in the technical expression \"wear and tear,\" a\nword which owes its origin to the cloths and silks which are used to\nmoderate the force of the impression, and to save wear to the type; a\nsquare of stuff (the _blanket_) being placed between the platen and the\nsheet of paper in the press.\n\nEve made a rough calculation of the resources of the printing office\nand of the output, and saw how little hope there was for a business\ndrained dry by the all-devouring activity of the brothers Cointet; for\nby this time the Cointets were not only contract printers to the town\nand the prefecture, and printers to the Diocese by special appointment\n--they were paper-makers and proprietors of a newspaper to boot. That\nnewspaper, sold two years ago by the Sechards, father and son, for\ntwenty-two thousand francs, was now bringing in eighteen thousand\nfrancs per annum. Eve began to understand the motives lurking beneath\nthe apparent generosity of the brothers Cointet; they were leaving the\nSechard establishment just sufficient work to gain a pittance, but not\nenough to establish a rival house.\n\nWhen Eve took the management of the business, she began by taking\nstock. She set Kolb and Marion and Cerizet to work, and the workshop\nwas put to rights, cleaned out, and set in order. Then one evening\nwhen David came in from a country excursion, followed by an old woman\nwith a huge bundle tied up in a cloth, Eve asked counsel of him as to\nthe best way of turning to profit the odds and ends left them by old\nSechard, promising that she herself would look after the business.\nActing upon her husband's advice, Mme. Sechard sorted all the remnants\nof paper which she found, and printed old popular legends in double\ncolumns upon a single sheet, such as peasants paste on their walls,\nthe histories of _The Wandering Jew_, _Robert the Devil_, _La Belle\nMaguelonne_ and sundry miracles. Eve sent Kolb out as a hawker.\n\nCerizet had not a moment to spare now; he was composing the naive\npages, with the rough cuts that adorned them, from morning to night;\nMarion was able to manage the taking off; and all domestic cares fell\nto Mme. Chardon, for Eve was busy coloring the prints. Thanks to\nKolb's activity and honesty, Eve sold three thousand broad sheets at a\npenny apiece, and made three hundred francs in all at a cost of thirty\nfrancs.\n\nBut when every peasant's hut and every little wine-shop for twenty\nleagues round was papered with these legends, a fresh speculation must\nbe discovered; the Alsacien could not go beyond the limits of the\ndepartment. Eve, turning over everything in the whole printing house,\nhad found a collection of figures for printing a \"Shepherd's\nCalendar,\" a kind of almanac meant for those who cannot read,\nletterpress being replaced by symbols, signs, and pictures in colored\ninks, red, black and blue. Old Sechard, who could neither read nor\nwrite himself, had made a good deal of money at one time by bringing\nout an almanac in hieroglyph. It was in book form, a single sheet\nfolded to make one hundred and twenty-eight pages.\n\nThoroughly satisfied with the success of the broad sheets, a piece of\nbusiness only undertaken by country printing offices, Mme. Sechard\ninvested all the proceeds in the _Shepherd's Calendar_, and began it\nupon a large scale. Millions of copies of this work are sold annually\nin France. It is printed upon even coarser paper than the _Almanac of\nLiege_, a ream (five hundred sheets) costing in the first instance\nabout four francs; while the printed sheets sell at the rate of a\nhalfpenny apiece--twenty-five francs per ream.\n\nMme. Sechard determined to use one hundred reams for the first\nimpression; fifty thousand copies would bring in two thousand francs.\nA man so deeply absorbed in his work as David in his researches is\nseldom observant; yet David, taking a look round his workshop, was\nastonished to hear the groaning of a press and to see Cerizet always\non his feet, setting up type under Mme. Sechard's direction. There was\na pretty triumph for Eve on the day when David came in to see what she\nwas doing, and praised the idea, and thought the calendar an excellent\nstroke of business. Furthermore, David promised to give advice in the\nmatter of colored inks, for an almanac meant to appeal to the eye; and\nfinally, he resolved to recast the ink-rollers himself in his\nmysterious workshop, so as to help his wife as far as he could in her\nimportant little enterprise.\n\nBut just as the work began with strenuous industry, there came letters\nfrom Lucien in Paris, heart-sinking letters that told his mother and\nsister and brother-in-law of his failure and distress; and when Eve,\nMme. Chardon, and David each secretly sent money to their poet, it\nmust be plain to the reader that the three hundred francs they sent\nwere like their very blood. The overwhelming news, the disheartening\nsense that work as bravely as she might, she made so little, left Eve\nlooking forward with a certain dread to an event which fills the cup\nof happiness to the full. The time was coming very near now, and to\nherself she said, \"If my dear David has not reached the end of his\nresearches before my confinement, what will become of us? And who will\nlook after our poor printing office and the business that is growing\nup?\"\n\nThe _Shepherd's Calendar_ ought by rights to have been ready before the\n1st of January, but Cerizet was working unaccountably slowly; all the\nwork of composing fell to him; and Mme. Sechard, knowing so little,\ncould not find fault, and was fain to content herself with watching\nthe young Parisian.\n\nCerizet came from the great Foundling Hospital in Paris. He had been\napprenticed to the MM. Didot, and between the ages of fourteen and\nseventeen he was David Sechard's fanatical worshiper. David put him\nunder one of the cleverest workmen, and took him for his copy-holder,\nhis page. Cerizet's intelligence naturally interested David; he won\nthe lad's affection by procuring amusements now and again for him, and\ncomforts from which he was cut off by poverty. Nature had endowed\nCerizet with an insignificant, rather pretty little countenance, red\nhair, and a pair of dull blue eyes; he had come to Angouleme and\nbrought the manners of the Parisian street-boy with him. He was\nformidable by reason of a quick, sarcastic turn and a spiteful\ndisposition. Perhaps David looked less strictly after him in\nAngouleme; or, perhaps, as the lad grew older, his mentor put more\ntrust in him, or in the sobering influences of a country town; but be\nthat as it may, Cerizet (all unknown to his sponsor) was going\ncompletely to the bad, and the printer's apprentice was acting the\npart of a Don Juan among little work girls. His morality, learned in\nParis drinking-saloons, laid down the law of self-interest as the sole\nrule of guidance; he knew, moreover, that next year he would be \"drawn\nfor a soldier,\" to use the popular expression, saw that he had no\nprospects, and ran into debt, thinking that soon he should be in the\narmy, and none of his creditors would run after him. David still\npossessed some ascendency over the young fellow, due not to his\nposition as master, nor yet to the interest that he had taken in his\npupil, but to the great intellectual power which the sometime\nstreet-boy fully recognized.\n\nBefore long Cerizet began to fraternize with the Cointets' workpeople,\ndrawn to them by the mutual attraction of blouse and jacket, and the\nclass feeling, which is, perhaps, strongest of all in the lowest ranks\nof society. In their company Cerizet forgot the little good doctrine\nwhich David had managed to instil into him; but, nevertheless, when\nthe others joked the boy about the presses in his workshop (\"old\nsabots,\" as the \"bears\" contemptuously called them), and showed him\nthe magnificent machines, twelve in number, now at work in the\nCointets' great printing office, where the single wooden press was\nonly used for experiments, Cerizet would stand up for David and fling\nout at the braggarts.\n\n\"My gaffer will go farther with his 'sabots' than yours with their\ncast-iron contrivances that turn out mass books all day long,\" he\nwould boast. \"He is trying to find out a secret that will lick all the\nprinting offices in France and Navarre.\"\n\n\"And meantime you take your orders from a washer-woman, you snip of a\nforeman, on two francs a day.\"\n\n\"She is pretty though,\" retorted Cerizet; \"it is better to have her to\nlook at than the phizes of your gaffers.\"\n\n\"And do you live by looking at his wife?\"\n\nFrom the region of the wineshop, or from the door of the printing\noffice, where these bickerings took place, a dim light began to break\nin upon the brothers Cointet as to the real state of things in the\nSechard establishment. They came to hear of Eve's experiment, and held\nit expedient to stop these flights at once, lest the business should\nbegin to prosper under the poor young wife's management.\n\n\"Let us give her a rap over the knuckles, and disgust her with the\nbusiness,\" said the brothers Cointet.\n\nOne of the pair, the practical printer, spoke to Cerizet, and asked\nhim to do the proof-reading for them by piecework, to relieve their\nreader, who had more than he could manage. So it came to pass that\nCerizet earned more by a few hours' work of an evening for the\nbrothers Cointet than by a whole day's work for David Sechard. Other\ntransactions followed; the Cointets seeing no small aptitude in\nCerizet, he was told that it was a pity that he should be in a\nposition so little favorable to his interests.\n\n\"You might be foreman some day in a big printing office, making six\nfrancs a day,\" said one of the Cointets one day, \"and with your\nintelligence you might come to have a share in the business.\"\n\n\"Where is the use of my being a good foreman?\" returned Cerizet. \"I am\nan orphan, I shall be drawn for the army next year, and if I get a bad\nnumber who is there to pay some one else to take my place?\"\n\n\"If you make yourself useful,\" said the well-to-do printer, \"why\nshould not somebody advance the money?\"\n\n\"It won't be my gaffer in any case!\" said Cerizet.\n\n\"Pooh! Perhaps by that time he will have found out the secret.\"\n\nThe words were spoken in a way that could not but rouse the worst\nthoughts in the listener; and Cerizet gave the papermaker and printer\na very searching look.\n\n\"I do not know what he is busy about,\" he began prudently, as the\nmaster said nothing, \"but he is not the kind of man to look for\ncapitals in the lower case!\"\n\n\"Look here, my friend,\" said the printer, taking up half-a-dozen\nsheets of the diocesan prayer-book and holding them out to Cerizet,\n\"if you can correct these for us by to-morrow, you shall have eighteen\nfrancs to-morrow for them. We are not shabby here; we put our\ncompetitor's foreman in the way of making money. As a matter of fact,\nwe might let Mme. Sechard go too far to draw back with her _Shepherd's\nCalendar_, and ruin her; very well, we give you permission to tell her\nthat we are bringing out a _Shepherd's Calendar_ of our own, and to call\nher attention too to the fact that she will not be the first in the\nfield.\"\n\nCerizet's motive for working so slowly on the composition of the\nalmanac should be clear enough by this time.\n\nWhen Eve heard that the Cointets meant to spoil her poor little\nspeculation, dread seized upon her; at first she tried to see a proof\nof attachment in Cerizet's hypocritical warning of competition; but\nbefore long she saw signs of an over-keen curiosity in her sole\ncompositor--the curiosity of youth, she tried to think.\n\n\"Cerizet,\" she said one morning, \"you stand about on the threshold,\nand wait for M. Sechard in the passage, to pry into his private\naffairs; when he comes out into the yard to melt down the rollers, you\nare there looking at him, instead of getting on with the almanac.\nThese things are not right, especially when you see that I, his wife,\nrespect his secrets, and take so much trouble on myself to leave him\nfree to give himself up to his work. If you had not wasted time, the\nalmanac would be finished by now, and Kolb would be selling it, and\nthe Cointets could have done us no harm.\"\n\n\"Eh! madame,\" answered Cerizet. \"Here am I doing five francs' worth of\ncomposing for two francs a day, and don't you think that that is\nenough? Why, if I did not read proofs of an evening for the Cointets,\nI might feed myself on husks.\"\n\n\"You are turning ungrateful early,\" said Eve, deeply hurt, not so much\nby Cerizet's grumbling as by his coarse tone, threatening attitude,\nand aggressive stare; \"you will get on in life.\"\n\n\"Not with a woman to order me about though, for it is not often that\nthe month has thirty days in it then.\"\n\nFeeling wounded in her womanly dignity, Eve gave Cerizet a withering\nlook and went upstairs again. At dinner-time she spoke to David.\n\n\"Are you sure, dear, of that little rogue Cerizet?\"\n\n\"Cerizet!\" said David. \"Why, he was my youngster; I trained him, I\ntook him on as my copy-holder. I put him to composing; anything that\nhe is he owes to me, in fact! You might as well ask a father if he is\nsure of his child.\"\n\nUpon this, Eve told her husband that Cerizet was reading proofs for\nthe Cointets.\n\n\"Poor fellow! he must live,\" said David, humbled by the consciousness\nthat he had not done his duty as a master.\n\n\"Yes, but there is a difference, dear, between Kolb and Cerizet--Kolb\ntramps about twenty leagues every day, spends fifteen or twenty sous,\nand brings us back seven and eight and sometimes nine francs of sales;\nand when his expenses are paid, he never asks for more than his wages.\nKolb would sooner cut off his hand than work a lever for the Cointets;\nKolb would not peer among the things that you throw out into the yard\nif people offered him a thousand crowns to do it; but Cerizet picks\nthem up and looks at them.\"\n\nIt is hard for noble natures to think evil, to believe in ingratitude;\nonly through rough experience do they learn the extent of human\ncorruption; and even when there is nothing left them to learn in this\nkind, they rise to an indulgence which is the last degree of contempt.\n\n\"Pooh! pure Paris street-boy's curiosity,\" cried David.\n\n\"Very well, dear, do me the pleasure to step downstairs and look at\nthe work done by this boy of yours, and tell me then whether he ought\nnot to have finished our almanac this month.\"\n\nDavid went into the workshop after dinner, and saw that the calendar\nshould have been set up in a week. Then, when he heard that the\nCointets were bringing out a similar almanac, he came to the rescue.\nHe took command of the printing office, Kolb helped at home instead of\nselling broadsheets. Kolb and Marion pulled off the impressions from\none form while David worked another press with Cerizet, and\nsuperintended the printing in various inks. Every sheet must be\nprinted four separate times, for which reason none but small houses\nwill attempt to produce a _Shepherd's Calendar_, and that only in the\ncountry where labor is cheap, and the amount of capital employed in\nthe business is so small that the interest amounts to little.\nWherefore, a press which turns out beautiful work cannot compete in\nthe printing of such sheets, coarse though they may be.\n\nSo, for the first time since old Sechard retired, two presses were at\nwork in the old house. The calendar was, in its way, a masterpiece;\nbut Eve was obliged to sell it for less than a halfpenny, for the\nCointets were supplying hawkers at the rate of three centimes per\ncopy. Eve made no loss on the copies sold to hawkers; on Kolb's sales,\nmade directly, she gained; but her little speculation was spoiled.\nCerizet saw that his fair employer distrusted him; in his own\nconscience he posed as the accuser, and said to himself, \"You suspect\nme, do you? I will have my revenge,\" for the Paris street-boy is made\non this wise. Cerizet accordingly took pay out of all proportion to\nthe work of proof-reading done for the Cointets, going to their office\nevery evening for the sheets, and returning them in the morning. He\ncame to be on familiar terms with them through the daily chat, and at\nlength saw a chance of escaping the military service, a bait held out\nto him by the brothers. So far from requiring prompting from the\nCointets, he was the first to propose the espionage and exploitation\nof David's researches.\n\nEve saw how little she could depend upon Cerizet, and to find another\nKolb was simply impossible; she made up her mind to dismiss her one\ncompositor, for the insight of a woman who loves told her that Cerizet\nwas a traitor; but as this meant a deathblow to the business, she took\na man's resolution. She wrote to M. Metivier, with whom David and the\nCointets and almost every papermaker in the department had business\nrelations, and asked him to put the following advertisement into a\ntrade paper:\n\n\n\"FOR SALE, as a going concern, a Printing Office, with License and\nPlant; situated at Angouleme. Apply for particulars to M. Metivier,\nRue Serpente.\"\n\n\nThe Cointets saw the advertisement. \"That little woman has a head on\nher shoulders,\" they said. \"It is time that we took her business under\nour own control, by giving her enough work to live upon; we might find\na real competitor in David's successor; it is in our interest to keep\nan eye upon that workshop.\"\n\nThe Cointets went to speak to David Sechard, moved thereto by this\nthought. Eve saw them, knew that her stratagem had succeeded at once,\nand felt a thrill of the keenest joy. They stated their proposal. They\nhad more work than they could undertake, their presses could not keep\npace with the work, would M. Sechard print for them? They had sent to\nBordeaux for workmen, and could find enough to give full employment to\nDavid's three presses.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" said Eve, while Cerizet went across to David's workshop\nto announce the two printers, \"while my husband was with the MM. Didot\nhe came to know of excellent workers, honest and industrious men; he\nwill choose his successor, no doubt, from among the best of them. If\nhe sold his business outright for some twenty thousand francs, it\nmight bring us in a thousand francs per annum; that would be better\nthan losing a thousand yearly over such trade as you leave us. Why did\nyou envy us the poor little almanac speculation, especially as we have\nalways brought it out?\"\n\n\"Oh, why did you not give us notice, madame? We would not have\ninterfered with you,\" one of the brothers answered blandly (he was\nknown as the \"tall Cointet\").\n\n\"Oh, come gentlemen! you only began your almanac after Cerizet told\nyou that I was bringing out mine.\"\n\nShe spoke briskly, looking full at \"the tall Cointet\" as she spoke. He\nlowered his eyes; Cerizet's treachery was proven to her.\n\nThis brother managed the business and the paper-mill; he was by far\nthe cleverer man of business of the two. Jean showed no small ability\nin the conduct of the printing establishment, but in intellectual\ncapacity he might be said to take colonel's rank, while Boniface was a\ngeneral. Jean left the command to Boniface. This latter was thin and\nspare in person; his face, sallow as an altar candle, was mottled with\nreddish patches; his lips were pinched; there was something in his\neyes that reminded you of a cat's eyes. Boniface Cointet never excited\nhimself; he would listen to the grossest insults with the serenity of\na bigot, and reply in a smooth voice. He went to mass, he went to\nconfession, he took the sacrament. Beneath his caressing manners,\nbeneath an almost spiritless look, lurked the tenacity and ambition of\nthe priest, and the greed of the man of business consumed with a\nthirst for riches and honors. In the year 1820 \"tall Cointet\" wanted\nall that the _bourgeoisie_ finally obtained by the Revolution of 1830.\nIn his heart he hated the aristocrats, and in religion he was\nindifferent; he was as much or as little of a bigot as Bonaparte was a\nmember of the Mountain; yet his vertebral column bent with a\nflexibility wonderful to behold before the noblesse and the official\nhierarchy; for the powers that be, he humbled himself, he was meek and\nobsequious. One final characteristic will describe him for those who\nare accustomed to dealings with all kinds of men, and can appreciate\nits value--Cointet concealed the expression of his eyes by wearing\ncolored glasses, ostensibly to preserve his sight from the reflection\nof the sunlight on the white buildings in the streets; for Angouleme,\nbeing set upon a hill, is exposed to the full glare of the sun. Tall\nCointet was really scarcely above middle height; he looked much taller\nthan he actually was by reason of the thinness, which told of overwork\nand a brain in continual ferment. His lank, sleek gray hair, cut in\nsomewhat ecclesiastical fashion; the black trousers, black stockings,\nblack waistcoat, and long puce-colored greatcoat (styled a _levite_ in\nthe south), all completed his resemblance to a Jesuit.\n\nBoniface was called \"tall Cointet\" to distinguish him from his\nbrother, \"fat Cointet,\" and the nicknames expressed a difference in\ncharacter as well as a physical difference between a pair of equally\nredoubtable personages. As for Jean Cointet, a jolly, stout fellow,\nwith a face from a Flemish interior, colored by the southern sun of\nAngouleme, thick-set, short and paunchy as Sancho Panza; with a smile\non his lips and a pair of sturdy shoulders, he was a striking contrast\nto his older brother. Nor was the difference only physical and\nintellectual. Jean might almost be called Liberal in politics; he\nbelonged to the Left Centre, only went to mass on Sundays, and lived\non a remarkably good understanding with the Liberal men of business.\nThere were those in L'Houmeau who said that this divergence between\nthe brothers was more apparent than real. Tall Cointet turned his\nbrother's seeming good nature to advantage very skilfully. Jean was\nhis bludgeon. It was Jean who gave all the hard words; it was Jean who\nconducted the executions which little beseemed the elder brother's\nbenevolence. Jean took the storms department; he would fly into a\nrage, and propose terms that nobody would think of accepting, to pave\nthe way for his brother's less unreasonable propositions. And by such\npolicy the pair attained their ends, sooner or later.\n\nEve, with a woman's tact, had soon divined the characters of the two\nbrothers; she was on her guard with foes so formidable. David,\ninformed beforehand of everything by his wife, lent a profoundly\ninattentive mind to his enemies' proposals.\n\n\"Come to an understanding with my wife,\" he said, as he left the\nCointets in the office and went back to his laboratory. \"Mme. Sechard\nknows more about the business than I do myself. I am interested in\nsomething that will pay better than this poor place; I hope to find a\nway to retrieve the losses that I have made through you----\"\n\n\"And how?\" asked the fat Cointet, chuckling.\n\nEve gave her husband a look that meant, \"Be careful!\"\n\n\"You will be my tributaries,\" said David, \"and all other consumers of\npapers besides.\"\n\n\"Then what are you investigating?\" asked the hypocritical Boniface\nCointet.\n\nBoniface's question slipped out smoothly and insinuatingly, and again\nEve's eyes implored her husband to give an answer that was no answer,\nor to say nothing at all.\n\n\"I am trying to produce paper at fifty per cent less than the present\ncost price,\" and he went. He did not see the glances exchanged between\nthe brothers. \"That is an inventor, a man of his build cannot sit with\nhis hands before him.--Let us exploit him,\" said Boniface's eyes. \"How\ncan we do it?\" said Jean's.\n\nMme. Sechard spoke. \"David treats me just in the same way,\" she said.\n\"If I show any curiosity, he feels suspicious of my name, no doubt,\nand out comes that remark of his; it is only a formula, after all.\"\n\n\"If your husband can work out the formula, he will certainly make a\nfortune more quickly than by printing; I am not surprised that he\nleaves the business to itself,\" said Boniface, looking across the\nempty workshop, where Kolb, seated upon a wetting-board, was rubbing\nhis bread with a clove of garlic; \"but it would not suit our views to\nsee this place in the hands of an energetic, pushing, ambitious\ncompetitor,\" he continued, \"and perhaps it might be possible to arrive\nat an understanding. Suppose, for instance, that you consented for a\nconsideration to allow us to put in one of our own men to work your\npresses for our benefit, but nominally for you; the thing is sometimes\ndone in Paris. We would find the fellow work enough to enable him to\nrent your place and pay you well, and yet make a profit for himself.\"\n\n\"It depends on the amount,\" said Eve Sechard. \"What is your offer?\"\nshe added, looking at Boniface to let him see that she understood his\nscheme perfectly well.\n\n\"What is your own idea?\" Jean Cointet put in briskly.\n\n\"Three thousand francs for six months,\" said she.\n\n\"Why, my dear young lady, you were proposing to sell the place\noutright for twenty thousand francs,\" said Boniface with much suavity.\n\"The interest on twenty thousand francs is only twelve hundred francs\nper annum at six per cent.\"\n\nFor a moment Eve was thrown into confusion; she saw the need for\ndiscretion in matters of business.\n\n\"You wish to use our presses and our name as well,\" she said; \"and, as\nI have already shown you, I can still do a little business. And then\nwe pay rent to M. Sechard senior, who does not load us with presents.\"\n\nAfter two hours of debate, Eve obtained two thousand francs for six\nmonths, one thousand to be paid in advance. When everything was\nconcluded, the brothers informed her that they meant to put in Cerizet\nas lessee of the premises. In spite of herself, Eve started with\nsurprise.\n\n\"Isn't it better to have somebody who knows the workshop?\" asked the\nfat Cointet.\n\nEve made no reply; she took leave of the brothers, vowing inwardly to\nlook after Cerizet.\n\n\"Well, here are our enemies in the place!\" laughed David, when Eve\nbrought out the papers for his signature at dinner-time.\n\n\"Pshaw!\" said she, \"I will answer for Kolb and Marion; they alone\nwould look after things. Besides, we shall be making an income of four\nthousand francs from the workshop, which only costs us money as it is;\nand looking forward, I see a year in which you may realize your\nhopes.\"\n\n\"You were born to be the wife of a scientific worker, as you said by\nthe weir,\" said David, grasping her hand tenderly.\n\nBut though the Sechard household had money sufficient that winter,\nthey were none the less subjected to Cerizet's espionage, and all\nunconsciously became dependent upon Boniface Cointet.\n\n\"We have them now!\" the manager of the paper-mill had exclaimed as he\nleft the house with his brother the printer. \"They will begin to\nregard the rent as regular income; they will count upon it and run\nthemselves into debt. In six months' time we will decline to renew the\nagreement, and then we shall see what this man of genius has at the\nbottom of his mind; we will offer to help him out of his difficulty by\ntaking him into partnership and exploiting his discovery.\"\n\nAny shrewd man of business who should have seen tall Cointet's face as\nhe uttered those words, \"taking him into partnership,\" would have\nknown that it behooves a man to be even more careful in the selection\nof the partner whom he takes before the Tribunal of Commerce than in\nthe choice of the wife whom he weds at the Mayor's office. Was it not\nenough already, and more than enough, that the ruthless hunters were\non the track of the quarry? How should David and his wife, with Kolb\nand Marion to help them, escape the toils of a Boniface Cointet?\n\nA draft for five hundred francs came from Lucien, and this, with\nCerizet's second payment, enabled them to meet all the expenses of\nMme. Sechard's confinement. Eve and the mother and David had thought\nthat Lucien had forgotten them, and rejoiced over this token of\nremembrance as they rejoiced over his success, for his first exploits\nin journalism made even more noise in Angouleme than in Paris.\n\nBut David, thus lulled into a false security, was to receive a\nstaggering blow, a cruel letter from Lucien:--\n\n\n               _Lucien to David._\n\n  \"MY DEAR DAVID,--I have drawn three bills on you, and negotiated\n  them with Metivier; they fall due in one, two, and three months'\n  time. I took this hateful course, which I know will burden you\n  heavily, because the one alternative was suicide. I will explain\n  my necessity some time, and I will try besides to send the amounts\n  as the bills fall due.\n\n  \"Burn this letter; say nothing to my mother and sister; for, I\n  confess it, I have counted upon you, upon the heroism known so\n  well to your despairing brother,\n\n                                               \"LUCIEN DE RUBEMPRE.\"\n\n\nBy this time Eve had recovered from her confinement.\n\n\"Your brother, poor fellow, is in desperate straits,\" David told her.\n\"I have sent him three bills for a thousand francs at one, two, and\nthree months; just make a note of them,\" and he went out into the\nfields to escape his wife's questionings.\n\nBut Eve had felt very uneasy already. It was six months since Lucien\nhad written to them. She talked over the news with her mother till her\nforebodings grew so dark that she made up her mind to dissipate them.\nShe would take a bold step in her despair.\n\nYoung M. de Rastignac had come to spend a few days with his family. He\nhad spoken of Lucien in terms that set Paris gossip circulating in\nAngouleme, till at last it reached the journalist's mother and sister.\nEve went to Mme. de Rastignac, asked the favor of an interview with\nher son, spoke of all her fears, and asked him for the truth. In a\nmoment Eve heard of her brother's connection with the actress Coralie,\nof his duel with Michel Chrestien, arising out of his own treacherous\nbehavior to Daniel d'Arthez; she received, in short, a version of\nLucien's history, colored by the personal feeling of a clever and\nenvious dandy. Rastignac expressed sincere admiration for the\nabilities so terribly compromised, and a patriotic fear for the future\nof a native genius; spite and jealousy masqueraded as pity and\nfriendliness. He spoke of Lucien's blunders. It seemed that Lucien had\nforfeited the favor of a very great person, and that a patent\nconferring the right to bear the name and arms of Rubempre had\nactually been made out and subsequently torn up.\n\n\"If your brother, madame, had been well advised, he would have been on\nthe way to honors, and Mme. de Bargeton's husband by this time; but\nwhat can you expect? He deserted her and insulted her. She is now Mme.\nla Comtesse Sixte du Chatelet, to her own great regret, for she loved\nLucien.\"\n\n\"Is it possible!\" exclaimed Mme. Sechard.\n\n\"Your brother is like a young eagle, blinded by the first rays of\nglory and luxury. When an eagle falls, who can tell how far he may\nsink before he drops to the bottom of some precipice? The fall of a\ngreat man is always proportionately great.\"\n\nEve came away with a great dread in her heart; those last words\npierced her like an arrow. She had been wounded to the quick. She said\nnot a word to anybody, but again and again a tear rolled down her\ncheeks, and fell upon the child at her breast. So hard is it to give\nup illusions sanctioned by family feeling, illusions that have grown\nwith our growth, that Eve had doubted Eugene de Rastignac. She would\nrather hear a true friend's account of her brother. Lucien had given\nthem d'Arthez's address in the days when he was full of enthusiasm for\nthe brotherhood; she wrote a pathetic letter to d'Arthez, and received\nthe following reply:--\n\n\n               _D'Arthez to Mme. Sechard._\n\n  \"MADAME,--You ask me to tell you the truth about the life that\n  your brother is leading in Paris; you are anxious for\n  enlightenment as to his prospects; and to encourage a frank answer\n  on my part, you repeat certain things that M. de Rastignac has\n  told you, asking me if they are true. With regard to the purely\n  personal matter, madame, M. de Rastignac's confidences must be\n  corrected in Lucien's favor. Your brother wrote a criticism of my\n  book, and brought it to me in remorse, telling me that he could\n  not bring himself to publish it, although obedience to the orders\n  of his party might endanger one who was very dear to him. Alas!\n  madame, a man of letters must needs comprehend all passions, since\n  it is his pride to express them; I understood that where a\n  mistress and a friend are involved, the friend is inevitably\n  sacrificed. I smoothed your brother's way; I corrected his\n  murderous article myself, and gave it my full approval.\n\n  \"You ask whether Lucien has kept my friendship and esteem; to this\n  it is difficult to make an answer. Your brother is on a road that\n  leads him to ruin. At this moment I still feel sorry for him;\n  before long I shall have forgotten him, of set purpose, not so\n  much on account of what he has done already as for that which he\n  inevitably will do. Your Lucien is not a poet, he has the poetic\n  temper; he dreams, he does not think; he spends himself in\n  emotion, he does not create. He is, in fact--permit me to say it\n  --a womanish creature that loves to shine, the Frenchman's great\n  failing. Lucien will always sacrifice his best friend for the\n  pleasure of displaying his own wit. He would not hesitate to sign\n  a pact with the Devil to-morrow if so he might secure a few years\n  of luxurious and glorious life. Nay, has he not done worse\n  already? He has bartered his future for the short-lived delights\n  of living openly with an actress. So far, he has not seen the\n  dangers of his position; the girl's youth and beauty and devotion\n  (for she worships him) have closed his eyes to the truth; he\n  cannot see that no glory or success or fortune can induce the\n  world to accept the position. Very well, as it is now, so it will\n  be with each new temptation--your brother will not look beyond the\n  enjoyment of the moment. Do not be alarmed: Lucien will never go\n  so far as a crime, he has not the strength of character; but he\n  would take the fruits of a crime, he would share the benefit but\n  not the risk--a thing that seems abhorrent to the whole world,\n  even to scoundrels. Oh, he would despise himself, he would repent;\n  but bring him once more to the test, and he would fail again; for\n  he is weak of will, he cannot resist the allurements of pleasure,\n  nor forego the least of his ambitions. He is indolent, like all\n  who would fain be poets; he thinks it clever to juggle with the\n  difficulties of life instead of facing and overcoming them. He\n  will be brave at one time, cowardly at another, and deserves\n  neither credit for his courage, nor blame for his cowardice.\n  Lucien is like a harp with strings that are slackened or tightened\n  by the atmosphere. He might write a great book in a glad or angry\n  mood, and care nothing for the success that he had desired for so\n  long.\n\n  \"When he first came to Paris he fell under the influence of an\n  unprincipled young fellow, and was dazzled by his companion's\n  adroitness and experience in the difficulties of a literary life.\n  This juggler completely bewitched Lucien; he dragged him into a\n  life which a man cannot lead and respect himself, and, unluckily\n  for Lucien, love shed its magic over the path. The admiration that\n  is given too readily is a sign of want of judgment; a poet ought\n  not to be paid in the same coin as a dancer on the tight-rope. We\n  all felt hurt when intrigue and literary rascality were preferred\n  to the courage and honor of those who counseled Lucien rather to\n  face the battle than to filch success, to spring down into the\n  arena rather than become a trumpet in the orchestra.\n\n  \"Society, madame, oddly enough, shows plentiful indulgence to\n  young men of Lucien's stamp; they are popular, the world is\n  fascinated by their external gifts and good looks. Nothing is\n  asked of them, all their sins are forgiven; they are treated like\n  perfect natures, others are blind to their defects, they are the\n  world's spoiled children. And, on the other hand, the world is\n  stern beyond measure to strong and complete natures. Perhaps in\n  this apparently flagrant injustice society acts sublimely, taking\n  a harlequin at his just worth, asking nothing of him but\n  amusement, promptly forgetting him; and asking divine great deeds\n  of those before whom she bends the knee. Everything is judged by\n  laws of its being; the diamond must be flawless; the ephemeral\n  creation of fashion may be flimsy, bizarre, inconsequent. So\n  Lucien may perhaps succeed to admiration in spite of his mistakes;\n  he has only to profit by some happy vein or to be among good\n  companions; but if an evil angel crosses his path, he will go to\n  the very depths of hell. 'Tis a brilliant assemblage of good\n  qualities embroidered upon too slight a tissue; time wears the\n  flowers away till nothing but the web is left; and if that is poor\n  stuff, you behold a rag at the last. So long as Lucien is young,\n  people will like him; but where will he be as a man of thirty?\n  That is the question which those who love him sincerely are bound\n  to ask themselves. If I alone had come to think in this way of\n  Lucien, I might perhaps have spared you the pain which my plain\n  speaking will give you; but to evade the questions put by your\n  anxiety, and to answer a cry of anguish like your letter with\n  commonplaces, seemed to me alike unworthy of you and of me, whom\n  you esteem too highly; and besides, those of my friends who knew\n  Lucien are unanimous in their judgment. So it appeared to me to be\n  a duty to put the truth before you, terrible though it may be.\n  Anything may be expected of Lucien, anything good or evil. That is\n  our opinion, and this letter is summed up in that sentence. If the\n  vicissitudes of his present way of life (a very wretched and\n  slippery one) should bring the poet back to you, use all your\n  influence to keep him among you; for until his character has\n  acquired stability, Paris will not be safe for him. He used to\n  speak of you, you and your husband, as his guardian angels; he has\n  forgotten you, no doubt; but he will remember you again when\n  tossed by tempest, with no refuge left to him but his home. Keep\n  your heart for him, madame; he will need it.\n\n  \"Permit me, madame, to convey to you the expression of the sincere\n  respect of a man to whom your rare qualities are known, a man who\n  honors your mother's fears so much, that he desires to style\n  himself your devoted servant,\n\n                                                         \"D'ARTHEZ.\"\n\n\nTwo days after the letter came, Eve was obliged to find a wet-nurse;\nher milk had dried up. She had made a god of her brother; now, in her\neyes, he was depraved through the exercise of his noblest faculties;\nhe was wallowing in the mire. She, noble creature that she was, was\nincapable of swerving from honesty and scrupulous delicacy, from all\nthe pious traditions of the hearth, which still burns so clearly and\nsheds its light abroad in quiet country homes. Then David had been\nright in his forecasts! The leaden hues of grief overspread Eve's\nwhite brow. She told her husband her secret in one of the pellucid\ntalks in which married lovers tell everything to each other. The tones\nof David's voice brought comfort. Though the tears stood in his eyes\nwhen he knew that grief had dried his wife's fair breast, and knew\nEve's despair that she could not fulfil a mother's duties, he held out\nreassuring hopes.\n\n\"Your brother's imagination has let him astray, you see, child. It is\nso natural that a poet should wish for blue and purple robes, and\nhurry as eagerly after festivals as he does. It is a bird that loves\nglitter and luxury with such simple sincerity, that God forgives him\nif man condemns him for it.\"\n\n\"But he is draining our lives!\" exclaimed poor Eve.\n\n\"He is draining our lives just now, but only a few months ago he saved\nus by sending us the first fruits of his earnings,\" said the good\nDavid. He had the sense to see that his wife was in despair, was going\nbeyond the limit, and that love for Lucien would very soon come back.\n\"Fifty years ago, or thereabouts, Mercier said in his _Tableau de Paris_\nthat a man cannot live by literature, poetry, letters, or science, by\nthe creatures of his brain, in short; and Lucien, poet that he is,\nwould not believe the experience of five centuries. The harvests that\nare watered with ink are only reaped ten or twelve years after the\nsowing, if indeed there is any harvest after all. Lucien has taken the\ngreen wheat for the sheaves. He will have learned something of life,\nat any rate. He was the dupe of a woman at the outset; he was sure to\nbe duped afterwards by the world and false friends. He has bought his\nexperience dear, that is all. Our ancestors used to say, 'If the son\nof the house brings back his two ears and his honor safe, all is\nwell----'\"\n\n\"Honor!\" poor Eve broke in. \"Oh, but Lucien has fallen in so many\nways! Writing against his conscience! Attacking his best friend!\nLiving upon an actress! Showing himself in public with her. Bringing\nus to lie on straw----\"\n\n\"Oh, that is nothing----!\" cried David, and suddenly stopped short.\nThe secret of Lucien's forgery had nearly escaped him, and, unluckily,\nhis start left a vague, uneasy impression on Eve.\n\n\"What do you mean by nothing?\" she answered. \"And where shall we find\nthe money to meet bills for three thousand francs?\"\n\n\"We shall be obliged to renew the lease with Cerizet, to begin with,\"\nsaid David. \"The Cointets have been allowing him fifteen per cent on\nthe work done for them, and in that way alone he has made six hundred\nfrancs, besides contriving to make five hundred francs by job\nprinting.\"\n\n\"If the Cointets know that, perhaps they will not renew the lease.\nThey will be afraid of him, for Cerizet is a dangerous man.\"\n\n\"Eh! what is that to me!\" cried David, \"we shall be rich in a very\nlittle while. When Lucien is rich, dear angel, he will have nothing\nbut good qualities.\"\n\n\"Oh! David, my dear, my dear; what is this that you have said\nunthinkingly? Then Lucien fallen into the clutches of poverty would\nnot have the force of character to resist evil? And you think just as\nM. d'Arthez thinks! No one is great unless he has strength of\ncharacter, and Lucien is weak. An angel must not be tempted--what is\nthat?\"\n\n\"What but a nature that is noble only in its own region, its own\nsphere, its heaven? I will spare him the struggle; Lucien is not meant\nfor it. Look here! I am so near the end now that I can talk to you\nabout the means.\"\n\nHe drew several sheets of white paper from his pocket, brandished them\nin triumph, and laid them on his wife's lap.\n\n\"A ream of this paper, royal size, would cost five francs at the\nmost,\" he added, while Eve handled the specimens with almost childish\nsurprise.\n\n\"Why, how did you make these sample bits?\" she asked.\n\n\"With an old kitchen sieve of Marion's.\"\n\n\"And are you not satisfied yet?\" asked Eve.\n\n\"The problem does not lie in the manufacturing process; it is a\nquestion of the first cost of the pulp. Alas, child, I am only a late\ncomer in a difficult path. As long ago as 1794, Mme. Masson tried to\nuse printed paper a second time; she succeeded, but what a price it\ncost! The Marquis of Salisbury tried to use straw as a material in\n1800, and the same idea occurred to Seguin in France in 1801. Those\nsheets in your hand are made from the common rush, the _arundo\nphragmites_, but I shall try nettles and thistles; for if the material\nis to continue to be cheap, one must look for something that will grow\nin marshes and waste lands where nothing else can be grown. The whole\nsecret lies in the preparation of the stems. At present my method is\nnot quite simple enough. Still, in spite of this difficulty, I feel\nsure that I can give the French paper trade the privilege of our\nliterature; papermaking will be for France what coal and iron and\ncoarse potter's clay are for England--a monopoly. I mean to be the\nJacquart of the trade.\"\n\nEve rose to her feet. David's simple-mindedness had roused her to\nenthusiasm, to admiration; she held out her arms to him and held him\ntightly to her, while she laid her head upon his shoulder.\n\n\"You give me my reward as if I had succeeded already,\" he said.\n\nFor all answer, Eve held up her sweet face, wet with tears, to his,\nand for a moment she could not speak.\n\n\"The kiss was not for the man of genius,\" she said, \"but for my\ncomforter. Here is a rising glory for the glory that has set; and, in\nthe midst of my grief for the brother that has fallen so low, my\nhusband's greatness is revealed to me.--Yes, you will be great, great\nlike the Graindorges, the Rouvets, and Van Robais, and the Persian who\ndiscovered madder, like all the men you have told me about; great men\nwhom nobody remembers, because their good deeds were obscure\nindustrial triumphs.\"\n\n\n\n\"What are they doing just now?\"\n\nIt was Boniface Cointet who spoke. He was walking up and down outside\nin the Place du Murier with Cerizet watching the silhouettes of the\nhusband and wife on the blinds. He always came at midnight for a chat\nwith Cerizet, for the latter played the spy upon his former master's\nevery movement.\n\n\"He is showing her the paper he made this morning, no doubt,\" said\nCerizet.\n\n\"What is it made of?\" asked the paper manufacturer.\n\n\"Impossible to guess,\" answered Cerizet; \"I made a hole in the roof\nand scrambled up and watched the gaffer; he was boiling pulp in a\ncopper pan all last night. There was a heap of stuff in a corner, but\nI could make nothing of it; it looked like a heap of tow, as near as I\ncould make out.\"\n\n\"Go no farther,\" said Boniface Cointet in unctuous tones; \"it would\nnot be right. Mme. Sechard will offer to renew your lease; tell her\nthat you are thinking of setting up for yourself. Offer her half the\nvalue of the plant and license, and, if she takes the bid, come to me.\nIn any case, spin the matter out. . . . Have they no money?\"\n\n\"Not a sou,\" said Cerizet.\n\n\"Not a sou,\" repeated tall Cointet.--\"I have them now,\" said he to\nhimself.\n\nMetivier, paper manufacturers' wholesale agent, and Cointet Brothers,\nprinters and paper manufacturers, were also bankers in all but name.\nThis surreptitious banking system defies all the ingenuity of the\nInland Revenue Department. Every banker is required to take out a\nlicense which, in Paris, costs five hundred francs; but no hitherto\ndevised method of controlling commerce can detect the delinquents, or\ncompel them to pay their due to the Government. And though Metivier\nand the Cointets were \"outside brokers,\" in the language of the Stock\nExchange, none the less among them they could set some hundreds of\nthousands of francs moving every three months in the markets of Paris,\nBordeaux, and Angouleme. Now it so fell out that that very evening\nCointet Brothers had received Lucien's forged bills in the course of\nbusiness. Upon this debt, tall Cointet forthwith erected a formidable\nengine, pointed, as will presently be seen, against the poor, patient\ninventor.\n\nBy seven o'clock next morning, Boniface Cointet was taking a walk by\nthe mill stream that turned the wheels in his big factory; the sound\nof the water covered his talk, for he was talking with a companion, a\nyoung man of nine-and-twenty, who had been appointed attorney to the\nCourt of First Instance in Angouleme some six weeks ago. The young\nman's name was Pierre Petit-Claud.\n\n\"You are a schoolfellow of David Sechard's, are you not?\" asked tall\nCointet by way of greeting to the young attorney. Petit-Claud had lost\nno time in answering the wealthy manufacturer's summons.\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Petit-Claud, keeping step with tall Cointet.\n\n\"Have you renewed the acquaintance?\"\n\n\"We have met once or twice at most since he came back. It could hardly\nhave been otherwise. In Paris I was buried away in the office or at\nthe courts on week-days, and on Sundays and holidays I was hard at\nwork studying, for I had only myself to look to.\" (Tall Cointet nodded\napprovingly.) \"When we met again, David and I, he asked me what I had\ndone with myself. I told him that after I had finished my time at\nPoitiers, I had risen to be Maitre Olivet's head-clerk, and that some\ntime or other I hoped to make a bid for his berth. I know a good deal\nmore of Lucien Chardon (de Rubempre he calls himself now), he was Mme.\nde Bargeton's lover, our great poet, David Sechard's brother-in-law,\nin fact.\"\n\n\"Then you can go and tell David of your appointment, and offer him\nyour services,\" said tall Cointet.\n\n\"One can't do that,\" said the young attorney.\n\n\"He has never had a lawsuit, and he has no attorney, so one can do\nthat,\" said Cointet, scanning the other narrowly from behind his\ncolored spectacles.\n\nA certain quantity of gall mingled with the blood in Pierre\nPetit-Claud's veins; his father was a tailor in L'Houmeau, and his\nschoolfellows had looked down upon him. His complexion was of the\nmuddy and unwholesome kind which tells a tale of bad health, late\nhours and penury, and almost always of a bad disposition. The best\ndescription of him may be given in two familiar expressions--he was\nsharp and snappish. His cracked voice suited his sour face, meagre\nlook, and magpie eyes of no particular color. A magpie eye, according\nto Napoleon, is a sure sign of dishonesty. \"Look at So-and-so,\" he\nsaid to Las Cases at Saint Helena, alluding to a confidential servant\nwhom he had been obliged to dismiss for malversation. \"I do not know\nhow I could have been deceived in him for so long; he has a magpie\neye.\" Tall Cointet, surveying the weedy little lawyer, noted his face\npitted with smallpox, the thin hair, and the forehead, bald already,\nreceding towards a bald cranium; saw, too, the confession of weakness\nin his attitude with the hand on the hip. \"Here is my man,\" said he to\nhimself.\n\nAs a matter of fact, this Petit-Claud, who had drunk scorn like water,\nwas eaten up with a strong desire to succeed in life; he had no money,\nbut nevertheless he had the audacity to buy his employer's connection\nfor thirty thousand francs, reckoning upon a rich marriage to clear\noff the debt, and looking to his employer, after the usual custom, to\nfind him a wife, for an attorney always has an interest in marrying\nhis successor, because he is the sooner paid off. But if Petit-Claud\ncounted upon his employer, he counted yet more upon himself. He had\nmore than average ability, and that of a kind not often found in the\nprovinces, and rancor was the mainspring of his power. A mighty hatred\nmakes a mighty effort.\n\nThere is a great difference between a country attorney and an attorney\nin Paris; tall Cointet was too clever not to know this, and to turn\nthe meaner passions that move a pettifogging lawyer to good account.\nAn eminent attorney in Paris, and there are many who may be so\nqualified, is bound to possess to some extent the diplomate's\nqualities; he had so much business to transact, business in which\nlarge interests are involved; questions of such wide interest are\nsubmitted to him that he does not look upon procedure as machinery for\nbringing money into his pocket, but as a weapon of attack and defence.\nA country attorney, on the other hand, cultivates the science of\ncosts, _broutille_, as it is called in Paris, a host of small items that\nswell lawyers' bills and require stamped paper. These weighty matters\nof the law completely fill the country attorney's mind; he has a bill\nof costs always before his eyes, whereas his brother of Paris thinks\nof nothing but his fees. The fee is a honorarium paid by a client over\nand above the bill of costs, for the more or less skilful conduct of\nhis case. One-half of the bill of costs goes to the Treasury, whereas\nthe entire fee belongs to the attorney. Let us admit frankly that the\nfees received are seldom as large as the fees demanded and deserved by\na clever lawyer. Wherefore, in Paris, attorneys, doctors, and\nbarristers, like courtesans with a chance-come lover, take very\nconsiderable precautions against the gratitude of clients. The client\nbefore and after the lawsuit would furnish a subject worthy of\nMeissonier; there would be brisk bidding among attorneys for the\npossession of two such admirable bits of genre.\n\nThere is yet another difference between the Parisian and the country\nattorney. An attorney in Paris very seldom appears in court, though he\nis sometimes called upon to act as arbitrator (_refere_). Barristers,\nat the present day, swarm in the provinces; but in 1822 the country\nattorney very often united the functions of solicitor and counsel. As\na result of this double life, the attorney acquired the peculiar\nintellectual defects of the barrister, and retained the heavy\nresponsibilities of the attorney. He grew talkative and fluent, and\nlost his lucidity of judgment, the first necessity for the conduct of\naffairs. If a man of more than ordinary ability tries to do the work\nof two men, he is apt to find that the two men are mediocrities. The\nParis attorney never spends himself in forensic eloquence; and as he\nseldom attempts to argue for and against, he has some hope of\npreserving his mental rectitude. It is true that he brings the balista\nof the law to work, and looks for the weapons in the armory of\njudicial contradictions, but he keeps his own convictions as to the\ncase, while he does his best to gain the day. In a word, a man loses\nhis head not so much by thinking as by uttering thoughts. The spoken\nword convinces the utterer; but a man can act against his own bad\njudgment without warping it, and contrive to win in a bad cause\nwithout maintaining that it is a good one, like the barrister. Perhaps\nfor this very reason an old attorney is the more likely of the two to\nmake a good judge.\n\nA country attorney, as we have seen, has plenty of excuses for his\nmediocrity; he takes up the cause of petty passions, he undertakes\npettifogging business, he lives by charging expenses, he strains the\nCode of procedure and pleads in court. In a word, his weak points are\nlegion; and if by chance you come across a remarkable man practising\nas a country attorney, he is indeed above the average level.\n\n\"I thought, sir, that you sent for me on your own affairs,\" said\nPetit-Claud, and a glance that put an edge on his words fell upon tall\nCointet's impenetrable blue spectacles.\n\n\"Let us have no beating about the bush,\" returned Boniface Cointet.\n\"Listen to me.\"\n\nAfter that beginning, big with mysterious import, Cointet set himself\ndown upon a bench, and beckoned Petit-Claud to do likewise.\n\n\"When M. du Hautoy came to Angouleme in 1804, on his way to his\nconsulship at Valence, he made the acquaintance of Mme. de Senonches,\nthen Mlle. Zephirine, and had a daughter by her,\" added Cointet for\nthe attorney's ear----\"Yes,\" he continued, as Petit-Claud gave a\nstart; \"yes, and Mlle. Zephirine's marriage with M. de Senoches soon\nfollowed the birth of the child. The girl was brought up in my\nmother's house; she is the Mlle. Francoise de la Haye in whom Mme. de\nSenoches takes an interest; she is her godmother in the usual style.\nNow, my mother farmed land belonging to old Mme. de Cardanet, Mlle.\nZephirine's grandmother; and as she knew the secret of the sole\nheiress of the Cardanets and the Senonches of the older branch, they\nmade me trustee for the little sum which M. Francois du Hautoy meant\nfor the girl's fortune. I made my own fortune with those ten thousand\nfrancs, which amount to thirty thousand at the present day. Mme. de\nSenonches is sure to give the wedding clothes, and some plate and\nfurniture to her goddaughter. Now, I can put you in the way of\nmarrying the girl, my lad,\" said Cointet, slapping Petit-Claud on the\nknee; \"and when you marry Francoise de la Haye, you will have a large\nnumber of the aristocracy of Angouleme as your clients. This\nunderstanding between us (under the rose) will open up magnificent\nprospects for you. Your position will be as much as any one could\nwant; in fact, they don't ask better, I know.\"\n\n\"What is to be done?\" Petit-Claud asked eagerly. \"You have an\nattorney, Maitre Cachan----\"\n\n\"And, moreover, I shall not leave Cachan at once for you; I shall only\nbe your client later on,\" said Cointet significantly. \"What is to be\ndone, do you ask, my friend? Eh! why, David Sechard's business. The\npoor devil has three thousand francs' worth of bills to meet; he will\nnot meet them; you will stave off legal proceedings in such a way as\nto increase the expenses enormously. Don't trouble yourself; go on,\npile on items. Doublon, my process-server, will act under Cachan's\ndirections, and he will lay on like a blacksmith. A word to the wise\nis sufficient. Now, young man?----\"\n\nAn eloquent pause followed, and the two men looked at each other.\n\n\"We have never seen each other,\" Cointet resumed; \"I have not said a\nsyllable to you; you know nothing about M. du Hautoy, nor Mme. de\nSenonches, nor Mlle. de la Haye; only, when the time comes, two months\nhence, you will propose for the young lady. If we should want to see\neach other, you will come here after dark. Let us have nothing in\nwriting.\"\n\n\"Then you mean to ruin Sechard?\" asked Petit-Claud.\n\n\"Not exactly; but he must be in jail for some time----\"\n\n\"And what is the object?\"\n\n\"Do you think that I am noodle enough to tell you that? If you have\nwit enough to find out, you will have sense enough to hold your\ntongue.\"\n\n\"Old Sechard has plenty of money,\" said Petit-Claud. He was beginning\nalready to enter into Boniface Cointet's notions, and foresaw a\npossible cause of failure.\n\n\"So long as the father lives, he will not give his son a farthing; and\nthe old printer has no mind as yet to send in an order for his funeral\ncards.\"\n\n\"Agreed!\" said Petit-Claud, promptly making up his mind. \"I don't ask\nyou for guarantees; I am an attorney. If any one plays me a trick,\nthere will be an account to settle between us.\"\n\n\"The rogue will go far,\" thought Cointet; he bade Petit-Claud\ngood-morning.\n\nThe day after this conference was the 30th of April, and the Cointets\npresented the first of the three bills forged by Lucien. Unluckily,\nthe bill was brought to poor Mme. Sechard; and she, seeing at once\nthat the signature was not in her husband's handwriting, sent for\nDavid and asked him point-blank:\n\n\"You did not put your name to that bill, did you?\"\n\n\"No,\" said he; \"your brother was so pressed for time that he signed\nfor me.\"\n\nEve returned the bill to the bank messenger sent by the Cointets.\n\n\"We cannot meet it,\" she said; then, feeling that her strength was\nfailing, she went up to her room. David followed her.\n\n\"Go quickly to the Cointets, dear,\" Eve said faintly; \"they will have\nsome consideration for you; beg them to wait; and call their attention\nbesides to the fact that when Cerizet's lease is renewed, they will\nowe you a thousand francs.\"\n\nDavid went forthwith to his enemies. Now, any foreman may become a\nmaster printer, but there are not always the makings of a good man of\nbusiness in a skilled typographer; David knew very little of business;\nwhen, therefore, with a heavily-beating heart and a sensation of\nthrottling, David had put his excuses badly enough and formulated his\nrequest, the answer--\"This is nothing to do with us; the bill has been\npassed on to us by Metivier; Metivier will pay us. Apply to M.\nMetivier\"--cut him short at once.\n\n\"Oh!\" cried Eve when she heard the result, \"as soon as the bill is\nreturned to M. Metivier, we may be easy.\"\n\nAt two o'clock the next day, Victor-Ange-Hermenegilde Doublon,\nbailiff, made protest for non-payment at two o'clock, a time when the\nPlace du Murier is full of people; so that though Doublon was careful\nto stand and chat at the back door with Marion and Kolb, the news of\nthe protest was known all over the business world of Angouleme that\nevening. Tall Cointet had enjoined it upon Master Doublon to show the\nSechards the greatest consideration; but when all was said and done,\ncould the bailiff's hypocritical regard for appearances save Eve and\nDavid from the disgrace of a suspension of payment? Let each judge for\nhimself. A tolerably long digression of this kind will seem all too\nshort; and ninety out of every hundred readers shall seize with\navidity upon details that possess all the piquancy of novelty, thus\nestablishing yet once again the trust of the well-known axiom, that\nthere is nothing so little known as that which everybody is supposed\nto know--the Law of the Land, to wit.\n\nAnd of a truth, for the immense majority of Frenchmen, a minute\ndescription of some part of the machinery of banking will be as\ninteresting as any chapter of foreign travel. When a tradesman living\nin one town gives a bill to another tradesman elsewhere (as David was\nsupposed to have done for Lucien's benefit), the transaction ceases to\nbe a simple promissory note, given in the way of business by one\ntradesman to another in the same place, and becomes in some sort a\nletter of exchange. When, therefore, Metivier accepted Lucien's three\nbills, he was obliged to send them for collection to his\ncorrespondents in Angouleme--to Cointet Brothers, that is to say.\nHence, likewise, a certain initial loss for Lucien in exchange on\nAngouleme, taking the practical shape of an abatement of so much per\ncent over and above the discount. In this way Sechard's bills had\npassed into circulation in the bank. You would not believe how greatly\nthe quality of banker, united with the august title of creditor,\nchanges the debtor's position. For instance, when a bill has been\npassed through the bank (please note that expression), and transferred\nfrom the money market in Paris to the financial world of Angouleme, if\nthat bill is protested, then the bankers in Angouleme must draw up a\ndetailed account of the expenses of protest and return; 'tis a duty\nwhich they owe to themselves. Joking apart, no account of the most\nromantic adventure could be more mildly improbable than this of the\njourney made by a bill. Behold a certain article in the Code of\ncommerce authorizing the most ingenious pleasantries after\nMascarille's manner, and the interpretation thereof shall make\napparent manifold atrocities lurking beneath the formidable word\n\"legal.\"\n\nMaster Doublon registered the protest and went himself with it to MM.\nCointet Brothers. The firm had a standing account with their bailiff;\nhe gave them six months' credit; and the lynxes of Angouleme\npractically took a twelvemonth, though tall Cointet would say month by\nmonth to the lynxes' jackal, \"Do you want any money, Doublon?\" Nor was\nthis all. Doublon gave the influential house a rebate upon every\ntransaction; it was the merest trifle, one franc fifty centimes on a\nprotest, for instance.\n\nTall Cointet quietly sat himself down at his desk and took out a small\nsheet of paper with a thirty-five centime stamp upon it, chatting as\nhe did so with Doublon as to the standing of some of the local\ntradesmen.\n\n\"Well, are you satisfied with young Gannerac?\"\n\n\"He is not doing badly. Lord, a carrier drives a trade----\"\n\n\"Drives a trade, yes; but, as a matter of fact, his expenses are a\nheavy pull on him; his wife spends a good deal, so they tell me----\"\n\n\"Of _his_ money?\" asked Doublon, with a knowing look.\n\nThe lynx meanwhile had finished ruling his sheet of paper, and now\nproceeded to trace the ominous words at the head of the following\naccount in bold characters:--\n\n\n              ACCOUNT OF EXPENSES OF PROTEST AND RETURN.\n\n  _To one bill for_ one thousand francs, _bearing date of February the\n  tenth, eighteen hundred and twenty-two, drawn by_ Sechard junior _of\n  Angouleme, to order of_ Lucien Chardon, _otherwise_ de Rubempre,\n  _endorsed to order of_ Metivier, _and finally to our order, matured\n  the thirtieth of April last, protested by_ Doublon, _process-server,\n  on the first of May, eighteen hundred and twenty-two._\n                                                  fr.    c.\n     Principal  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1000   --\n     Expenses of Protest. . . . . . . . . . . . .   12   35\n     Bank charges, one-half per cent. . . . . . .    5   --\n     Brokerage, one-quarter per cent. . . . . . .    2   50\n     Stamp on re-draft and present account. . . .    1   35\n     Interest and postage . . . . . . . . . . . .    3   --\n                                                  ____ ____\n                                                  1024   20\n     Exchange at the rate of one and a quarter\n        per cent on 1024 fr. 20 c.. . . . . . . .   13   25\n                                                  ____ ____\n               Total. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1037   45\n\n  _One thousand and thirty-seven francs forty-five centimes, for\n  which we repay ourselves by our draft at sight upon M.

Gannerac of L'Houmeau._\n\n    ANGOULEME, May 2, 1822                         COINTET BROTHERS.\n\n\nAt the foot of this little memorandum, drafted with the ease that\ncomes of long practice (for the writer chatted with Doublon as he\nwrote), there appeared the subjoined form of declaration:--\n\n\n  \"We, the undersigned, Postel of L'Houmeau, pharmaceutical chemist,\n  and Gannerac, forwarding agent, merchant of this town, hereby\n  certify that the present rate of exchange on Paris is one and a\n  quarter per cent.\n\n  \"ANGOULEME, May 2, 1822.\"\n\n\n\"Here, Doublon, be so good as to step round and ask Postel and\nGannerac to put their names to this declaration, and bring it back\nwith you to-morrow morning.\"\n\nAnd Doublon, quite accustomed as he was to these instruments of\ntorture, forthwith went, as if it were the simplest thing in the\nworld. Evidently the protest might have been sent in an envelope, as\nin Paris, and even so all Angouleme was sure to hear of the poor\nSechards' unlucky predicament. How they all blamed his want of\nbusiness energy! His excessive fondness for his wife had been the ruin\nof him, according to some; others maintained that it was his affection\nfor his brother-in-law; and what shocking conclusions did they not\ndraw from these premises! A man ought never to embrace the interests\nof his kith and kin. Old Sechard's hard-hearted conduct met with\napproval, and people admired him for his treatment of his son!\n\nAnd now, all you who for any reason whatsoever should forget to \"honor\nyour engagements,\" look well into the methods of the banking business,\nby which one thousand francs may be made to pay interest at the rate\nof twenty-eight francs in ten minutes, without breaking the law of the\nland.\n\nThe thousand francs, the one incontestable item in the account, comes\nfirst.\n\nThe second item is shared between the bailiff and the Inland Revenue\nDepartment. The six francs due to the State for providing a piece of\nstamped paper, and putting the debtor's mortification on record, will\nprobably ensure a long life to this abuse; and as you already know,\none franc fifty centimes from this item found its way into the\nbanker's pockets in the shape of Doublon's rebate.\n\n\"Bank charges one-half per cent,\" runs the third item, which appears\nupon the ingenious plea that if a banker has not received payment, he\nhas for all practical purposes discounted a bill. And although the\ncontrary may be the case, if you fail to receive a thousand francs, it\nseems to be very much the same thing as if you had paid them away.\nEverybody who has discounted a bill knows that he has to pay more than\nthe six per cent fixed by law; for a small percentage appears under\nthe humble title of \"charges,\" representing a premium on the financial\ngenius and skill with which the capitalist puts his money out to\ninterest. The more money he makes out of you, the more he asks.\nWherefore it would be undoubtedly cheaper to discount a bill with a\nfool, if fools there be in the profession of bill-discounting.\n\nThe law requires the banker to obtain a stock-broker's certificate for\nthe rate of exchange. When a place is so unlucky as to boast no stock\nexchange, two merchants act instead. This is the significance of the\nitem \"brokerage\"; it is a fixed charge of a quarter per cent on the\namount of the protested bill. The custom is to consider the amount as\npaid to the merchants who act for the stock-broker, and the banker\nquietly puts the money into his cash-box. So much for the third item\nin this delightful account.\n\nThe fourth includes the cost of the piece of stamped paper on which\nthe account itself appears, as well as the cost of the stamp for\nre-draft, as it is ingeniously named, viz., the banker's draft upon\nhis colleague in Paris.\n\nThe fifth is a charge for postage and the legal interest due upon the\namount for the time that it may happen to be absent from the banker's\nstrong box.\n\nThe final item, the exchange, is the object for which the bank exists,\nwhich is to say, for the transmission of sums of money from one place\nto another.\n\nNow, sift this account thoroughly, and what do you find? The method of\ncalculation closely resembles Polichinelle's arithmetic in Lablache's\nNeapolitan song, \"fifteen and five make twenty-two.\" The signatures of\nMessieurs Postel and Gannerac were obviously given to oblige in the\nway of business; the Cointets would act at need for Gannerac as\nGannerac acted for the Cointets. It was a practical application of the\nwell-known proverb, \"Reach me the rhubarb and I will pass you the\nsenna.\" Cointet Brothers, moreover, kept a standing account with\nMetivier; there was no need of a re-draft, and no re-draft was made. A\nreturned bill between the two firms simply meant a debit or credit\nentry and another line in a ledger.\n\nThis highly-colored account, therefore, is reduced to the one thousand\nfrancs, with an additional thirteen francs for expenses of protest,\nand half per cent for a month's delay, one thousand and eighteen\nfrancs it may be in all.\n\nSuppose that in a large banking-house a bill for a thousand francs is\ndaily protested on an average, then the banker receives twenty-eight\nfrancs a day by the grace of God and the constitution of the banking\nsystem, that all powerful invention due to the Jewish intellect of the\nMiddle Ages, which after six centuries still controls monarchs and\npeoples. In other words, a thousand francs would bring such a house\ntwenty-eight francs per day, or ten thousand two hundred and twenty\nfrancs per annum. Triple the average of protests, and consequently of\nexpenses, and you shall derive an income of thirty thousand francs per\nannum, interest upon purely fictitious capital. For which reason,\nnothing is more lovingly cultivated than these little \"accounts of\nexpenses.\"\n\nIf David Sechard had come to pay his bill on the 3rd of May, that is,\nthe day after it was protested, MM. Cointet Brothers would have met\nhim at once with, \"We have returned your bill to M. Metivier,\"\nalthough, as a matter of fact, the document would have been lying upon\nthe desk. A banker has a right to make out the account of expenses on\nthe evening of the day when the bill is protested, and he uses the\nright to \"sweat the silver crowns,\" in the country banker's phrase.\n\nThe Kellers, with correspondents all over the world, make twenty\nthousand francs per annum by charges for postage alone; accounts of\nexpenses of protest pay for Mme. la Baronne de Nucingen's dresses,\nopera box, and carriage. The charge for postage is a more shocking\nswindle, because a house will settle ten matters of business in as\nmany lines of a single letter. And of the tithe wrung from misfortune,\nthe Government, strange to say! takes its share, and the national\nrevenue is swelled by a tax on commercial failure. And the Bank? from\nthe august height of a counting-house she flings an observation, full\nof commonsense, at the debtor, \"How is it?\" asks she, \"that you cannot\nmeet your bill?\" and, unluckily, there is no reply to the question.\nWherefore, the \"account of expenses\" is an account bristling with\ndreadful fictions, fit to cause any debtor, who henceforth shall\nreflect upon this instructive page, a salutary shudder.\n\nOn the 4th of May, Metivier received the account from Cointet\nBrothers, with instructions to proceed against M. Lucien Chardon,\notherwise de Rubempre, with the utmost rigor of the law.\n\nEve also wrote to M. Metivier, and a few days later received an answer\nwhich reassured her completely:--\n\n\n               _To M. Sechard, Junior, Printer, Angouleme._\n\n  \"I have duly received your esteemed favor of the 5th instant. From\n  your explanation of the bill due on April 30th, I understand that\n  you have obliged your brother-in-law, M. de Rubempre, who is\n  spending so much that it will be doing you a service to summons\n  him. His present position is such that he is likely to delay\n  payment for long. If your brother-in-law should refuse payment, I\n  shall rely upon the credit of your old-established house.--I sign\n  myself now, as ever, your obedient servant,\n                                                         \"Metivier.\"\n\n\n\"Well,\" said Eve, commenting upon the letter to David, \"Lucien will\nknow when they summons him that we could not pay.\"\n\nWhat a change wrought in Eve those few words meant! The love that grew\ndeeper as she came to know her husband's character better and better,\nwas taking the place of love for her brother in her heart. But to how\nmany illusions had she not bade farewell?\n\nAnd now let us trace out the whole history of the bill and the account\nof expenses in the business world of Paris. The law enacts that the\nthird holder, the technical expression for the third party into whose\nhands the bill passes, is at liberty to proceed for the whole amount\nagainst any one of the various endorsers who appears to him to be most\nlikely to make prompt payment. M. Metivier, using this discretion,\nserved a summons upon Lucien. Behold the successive stages of the\nproceedings, all of them perfectly futile. Metivier, with the Cointets\nbehind him, knew that Lucien was not in a position to pay, but\ninsolvency in fact is not insolvency in law until it has been formally\nproved.\n\nFormal proof of Lucien's inability to pay was obtained in the\nfollowing manner:\n\nOn the 5th of May, Metivier's process-server gave Lucien notice of the\nprotest and an account of the expense thereof, and summoned him to\nappear before the Tribunal of Commerce, or County Court, of Paris, to\nhear a vast number of things: this, among others, that he was liable\nto imprisonment as a merchant. By the time that Lucien, hard pressed\nand hunted down on all sides, read this jargon, he received notice of\njudgment against him by default. Coralie, his mistress, ignorant of\nthe whole matter, imagined that Lucien had obliged his brother-in-law,\nand handed him all the documents together--too late. An actress sees\nso much of bailiffs, duns, and writs, upon the stage, that she looks\non all stamped paper as a farce.\n\nTears filled Lucien's eyes; he was unhappy on Sechard's account, he\nwas ashamed of the forgery, he wished to pay, he desired to gain time.\nNaturally he took counsel of his friends. But by the time Lousteau,\nBlondet, Bixiou, and Nathan had told the poet to snap his fingers at a\ncourt only established for tradesmen, Lucien was already in the\nclutches of the law. He beheld upon his door the little yellow placard\nwhich leaves its reflection on the porter's countenance, and exercises\na most astringent influence upon credit; striking terror into the\nheart of the smallest tradesman, and freezing the blood in the veins\nof a poet susceptible enough to care about the bits of wood, silken\nrags, dyed woolen stuffs, and multifarious gimcracks entitled\nfurniture.\n\nWhen the broker's men came for Coralie's furniture, the author of the\n_Marguerites_ fled to a friend of Bixiou's, one Desroches, a barrister,\nwho burst out laughing at the sight of Lucien in such a state about\nnothing at all.\n\n\"That is nothing, my dear fellow. Do you want to gain time?\"\n\n\"Yes, as much possible.\"\n\n\"Very well, apply for stay of execution. Go and look up Masson, he is\na solicitor in the Commercial Court, and a friend of mine. Take your\ndocuments to him. He will make a second application for you, and give\nnotice of objection to the jurisdiction of the court. There is not the\nleast difficulty; you are a journalist, your name is well known\nenough. If they summons you before a civil court, come to me about it,\nthat will be my affair; I engage to send anybody who offers to annoy\nthe fair Coralie about his business.\"\n\nOn the 28th of May, Lucien's case came on in the civil court, and\njudgment was given before Desroches expected it. Lucien's creditor was\npushing on the proceedings against him. A second execution was put in,\nand again Coralie's pilasters were gilded with placards. Desroches\nfelt rather foolish; a colleague had \"caught him napping,\" to use his\nown expression. He demurred, not without reason, that the furniture\nbelonged to Mlle. Coralie, with whom Lucien was living, and demanded\nan order for inquiry. Thereupon the judge referred the matter to the\nregistrar for inquiry, the furniture was proved to belong to the\nactress, and judgment was entered accordingly.

On the morning of the very day when Doublon served\nthe writ upon Eve, requiring her to pay a sum so enormous in her eyes,\nthere came a letter like a thunderbolt from Metivier:--\n\n\n          _To Monsieur Sechard, Junior, Printer, Angouleme._\n\n  \"SIR,--Your brother-in-law, M. Chardon, is so shamelessly\n  dishonest, that he declares his furniture to be the property of an\n  actress with whom he is living. You ought to have informed me\n  candidly of these circumstances, and not have allowed me to go to\n  useless expense over law proceedings. I have received no answer\n  to my letter of the 10th of May last. You must not, therefore,\n  take it amiss if I ask for immediate repayment of the three bills\n  and the expenses to which I have been put.--Yours, etc.,\n                                                         \"METIVIER.\"\n\n\nEve had heard nothing during these months, and supposed, in her\nignorance of commercial law, that her brother had made reparation for\nhis sins by meeting the forged bills.\n\n\"Be quick, and go at once to Petit-Claud, dear,\" she said; \"tell him\nabout it, and ask his advice.\"\n\nDavid hurried to his schoolfellow's office.\n\n\"When you came to tell me of your appointment and offered me your\nservices, I did not think that I should need them so soon,\" he said.\n\nPetit-Claud studied the fine face of this man who sat opposite him in\nthe office chair, and scarcely listened to the details of the case,\nfor he knew more of them already than the speaker. As soon as he saw\nSechard's anxiety, he said to himself, \"The trick has succeeded.\"\n\nThis kind of comedy is often played in an attorney's office. \"Why are\nthe Cointets persecuting him?\" Petit-Claud wondered within himself,\nfor the attorney can use his wit to read his clients' thoughts as\nclearly as the ideas of their opponents, and it is his business to see\nboth sides of the judicial web.\n\n\"You want to gain time,\" he said at last, when Sechard had come to an\nend. \"How long do you want? Something like three or four months?\"\n\n\"Oh! four months! that would be my salvation,\" exclaimed David.\nPetit-Claud appeared to him as an angel.\n\n\"Very well. No one shall lay hands on any of your furniture, and no\none shall arrest you for four months----But it will cost you a great\ndeal,\" said Petit-Claud.\n\n\"Eh! what does that matter to me?\" cried Sechard.\n\n\"You are expecting some money to come in; but are you sure of it?\"\nasked Petit-Claud, astonished at the way in which his client walked\ninto the toils.\n\n\"In three months' time I shall have plenty of money,\" said the\ninventor, with an inventor's hopeful confidence.\n\n\"Your father is still above ground,\" suggested Petit-Claud; \"he is in\nno hurry to leave his vines.\"\n\n\"Do you think that I am counting on my father's death?\" returned\nDavid. \"I am on the track of a trade secret, the secret of making a\nsheet of paper as strong as Dutch paper, without a thread of cotton in\nit, and at a cost of fifty per cent less than cotton pulp.\"\n\n\"There is a fortune in that!\" exclaimed Petit-Claud. He knew now what\nthe tall Cointet meant.\n\n\"A large fortune, my friend, for in ten years' time the demand for\npaper will be ten times larger than it is to-day. Journalism will be\nthe craze of our day.\"\n\n\"Nobody knows your secret?\"\n\n\"Nobody except my wife.\"\n\n\"You have not told any one what you mean to do--the Cointets, for\nexample?\"\n\n\"I did say something about it, but in general terms, I think.\"\n\nA sudden spark of generosity flashed through Petit-Claud's rancorous\nsoul; he tried to reconcile Sechard's interests with the Cointet's\nprojects and his own.\n\n\"Listen, David, we are old schoolfellows, you and I; I will fight your\ncase; but understand this clearly--the defence, in the teeth of the\nlaw, will cost you five or six thousand francs! Do not compromise your\nprospects. I think you will be compelled to share the profits of your\ninvention with some one of our paper manufacturers. Let us see now.\nYou will think twice before you buy or build a paper mill; and there\nis the cost of the patent besides. All this means time, and money too.\nThe servers of writs will be down upon you too soon, perhaps, although\nwe are going to give them the slip----\"\n\n\"I have my secret,\" said David, with the simplicity of the man of\nbooks.\n\n\"Well and good, your secret will be your plank of safety,\" said\nPetit-Claud; his first loyal intention of avoiding a lawsuit by a\ncompromise was frustrated. \"I do not wish to know it; but mind this\nthat I tell you. Work in the bowels of the earth if you can, so that\nno one may watch you and gain a hint from your ways of working, or\nyour plank will be stolen from under your feet. An inventor and a\nsimpleton often live in the same skin. Your mind runs so much on your\nsecrets that you cannot think of everything. People will begin to have\ntheir suspicions at last, and the place is full of paper manufacturers.\nSo many manufacturers, so many enemies for you! You are like a beaver\nwith the hunters about you; do not give them your skin----\"\n\n\"Thank you, dear fellow, I have told myself all this,\" exclaimed\nSechard, \"but I am obliged to you for showing so much concern for me\nand for your forethought. It does not really matter to me myself. An\nincome of twelve hundred francs would be enough for me, and my father\nought by rights to leave me three times as much some day. Love and\nthought make up my life--a divine life. I am working for Lucien's sake\nand for my wife's.\"\n\n\"Come, give me this power of attorney, and think of nothing but your\ndiscovery. If there should be any danger of arrest, I will let you\nknow in time, for we must think of all possibilities. And let me tell\nyou again to allow no one of whom you are not so sure as you are of\nyourself to come into your place.\"\n\n\"Cerizet did not care to continue the lease of the plant and premises,\nhence our little money difficulties. We have no one at home now but\nMarion and Kolb, an Alsacien as trusty as a dog, and my wife and her\nmother----\"\n\n\"One word,\" said Petit-Claud, \"don't trust that dog----\"\n\n\"You do not know him,\" exclaimed David; \"he is like a second self.\"\n\n\"May I try him?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Sechard.\n\n\"There, good-bye, but send Mme. Sechard to me; I must have a power of\nattorney from your wife. And bear in mind, my friend, that there is a\nfire burning in your affairs,\" said Petit-Claud, by way of warning of\nall the troubles gathering in the law courts to burst upon David's\nhead.\n\n\"Here am I with one foot in Burgundy and the other in Champagne,\" he\nadded to himself as he closed the office door on David.\n\nHarassed by money difficulties, beset with fears for his wife's\nhealth, stung to the quick by Lucien's disgrace, David had worked on\nat his problem. He had been trying to find a single process to replace\nthe various operations of pounding and maceration to which all flax or\ncotton or rags, any vegetable fibre, in fact, must be subjected; and\nas he went to Petit-Claud's office, he abstractedly chewed a bit of\nnettle stalk that had been steeping in water. On his way home,\ntolerably satisfied with his interview, he felt a little pellet\nsticking between his teeth. He laid it on his hand, flattened it out,\nand saw that the pulp was far superior to any previous result. The\nwant of cohesion is the great drawback of all vegetable fibre; straw,\nfor instance, yields a very brittle paper, which may almost be called\nmetallic and resonant. These chances only befall bold inquirers into\nNature's methods!\n\n\"Now,\" said he to himself, \"I must contrive to do by machinery and\nsome chemical agency the thing that I myself have done unconsciously.\"\n\nWhen his wife saw him, his face was radiant with belief in victory.\nThere were traces of tears in Eve's face.\n\n\"Oh! my darling, do not trouble yourself; Petit-Claud will guarantee\nthat we shall not be molested for several months to come. There will\nbe a good deal of expense over it; but, as Petit-Claud said when he\ncame to the door with me, 'A Frenchman has a right to keep his\ncreditors waiting, provided he repays them capital, interest, and\ncosts.'--Very well, then, we shall do that----\"\n\n\"And live meanwhile?\" asked poor Eve, who thought of everything.\n\n\"Ah! that is true,\" said David, carrying his hand to his ear after the\nunaccountable fashion of most perplexed mortals.\n\n\"Mother will look after little Lucien, and I can go back to work\nagain,\" said she.\n\n\"Eve! oh, my Eve!\" cried David, holding his wife closely to him.--\"At\nSaintes, not very far from here, in the sixteenth century, there lived\none of the very greatest of Frenchmen, for he was not merely the\ninventor of glaze, he was the glorious precursor of Buffon and Cuvier\nbesides; he was the first geologist, good, simple soul that he was.\nBernard Palissy endured the martyrdom appointed for all seekers into\nsecrets but his wife and children and all his neighbors were against\nhim. His wife used to sell his tools; nobody understood him, he\nwandered about the countryside, he was hunted down, they jeered at\nhim. But I--am loved----\"\n\n\"Dearly loved!\" said Eve, with the quiet serenity of the love that is\nsure of itself.\n\n\"And so may well endure all that poor Bernard Palissy suffered\n--Bernard Palissy, the discoverer of Ecouen ware, the Huguenot\nexcepted by Charles IX. on the day of Saint-Bartholomew. He lived to\nbe rich and honored in his old age, and lectured on the 'Science of\nEarths,' as he called it, in the face of Europe.\"\n\n\"So long as my fingers can hold an iron, you shall want for nothing,\"\ncried the poor wife, in tones that told of the deepest devotion. \"When\nI was Mme. Prieur's forewoman I had a friend among the girls, Basine\nClerget, a cousin of Postel's, a very good child; well, Basine told me\nthe other day when she brought back the linen, that she was taking\nMme. Prieur's business; I will work for her.\"\n\n\"Ah! you shall not work there for long,\" said David; \"I have found\nout----\"\n\nEve, watching his face, saw the sublime belief in success which\nsustains the inventor, the belief that gives him courage to go forth\ninto the virgin forests of the country of Discovery; and, for the\nfirst time in her life, she answered that confident look with a\nhalf-sad smile. David bent his head mournfully.\n\n\"Oh! my dear! I am not laughing! I did not doubt! It was not a sneer!\"\ncried Eve, on her knees before her husband. \"But I see plainly now\nthat you were right to tell me nothing about your experiments and your\nhopes. Ah! yes, dear, an inventor should endure the long painful\ntravail of a great idea alone, he should not utter a word of it even\nto his wife. . . . A woman is a woman still. This Eve of yours could\nnot help smiling when she heard you say, 'I have found out,' for the\nseventeenth time this month.\"\n\nDavid burst out laughing so heartily at his own expense that Eve\ncaught his hand in hers and kissed it reverently. It was a delicious\nmoment for them both, one of those roses of love and tenderness that\ngrow beside the desert paths of the bitterest poverty, nay, at times\nin yet darker depths.\n\nAs the storm of misfortune grew, Eve's courage redoubled; the\ngreatness of her husband's nature, his inventor's simplicity, the\ntears that now and again she saw in the eyes of this dreamer of dreams\nwith the tender heart,--all these things aroused in her an unsuspected\nenergy of resistance. Once again she tried the plan that had succeeded\nso well already. She wrote to M. Metivier, reminding him that the\nprinting office was for sale, offered to pay him out of the proceeds,\nand begged him not to ruin David with needless costs. Metivier\nreceived the heroic letter, and shammed dead. His head-clerk replied\nthat in the absence of M. Metivier he could not take it upon himself\nto stay proceedings, for his employer had made it a rule to let the\nlaw take its course. Eve wrote again, offering this time to renew the\nbills and pay all the costs hitherto incurred. To this the clerk\nconsented, provided that Sechard senior guaranteed payment. So Eve\nwalked over to Marsac, taking Kolb and her mother with her. She braved\nthe old vinedresser, and so charming was she, that the old man's face\nrelaxed, and the puckers smoothed out at the sight of her; but when,\nwith inward quakings, she came to speak of a guarantee, she beheld a\nsudden and complete change of the tippleographic countenance.\n\n\"If I allowed my son to put his hand to the lips of my cash box\nwhenever he had a mind, he would plunge it deep into the vitals, he\nwould take all I have!\" cried old Sechard. \"That is the way with\nchildren; they eat up their parents' purse. What did I do myself, eh?\n_I_ never cost my parents a farthing. Your printing office is standing\nidle. The rats and the mice do all the printing that is done in\nit. . . . You have a pretty face; I am very fond of you; you are a\ncareful, hard-working woman; but that son of mine!--Do you know what\nDavid is? I'll tell you--he is a scholar that will never do a stroke\nof work! If I had reared him, as I was reared myself, without knowing\nhis letters, and if I had made a 'bear' of him, like his father before\nhim, he would have money saved and put out to interest by now. . . .\nOh! he is my cross, that fellow is, look you! And, unluckily, he is\nall the family I have, for there is never like to be a later edition.\nAnd when he makes you unhappy----\"\n\nEve protested with a vehement gesture of denial.\n\n\"Yes, he does,\" affirmed old Sechard; \"you had to find a wet-nurse for\nthe child. Come, come, I know all about it, you are in the county\ncourt, and the whole town is talking about you. I was only a 'bear,'\n_I_ have no book learning, _I_ was not foreman at the Didots', the\nfirst printers in the world; but yet I never set eyes on a bit of\nstamped paper. Do you know what I say to myself as I go to and fro\namong my vines, looking after them and getting in my vintage, and\ndoing my bits of business?--I say to myself, 'You are taking a lot of\ntrouble, poor old chap; working to pile one silver crown on another,\nyou will leave a fine property behind you, and the bailiffs and the\nlawyers will get it all; . . . or else it will go in nonsensical\nnotions and crotchets.'--Look you here, child; you are the mother of\nyonder little lad; it seemed to me as I held him at the font with Mme.\nChardon that I could see his old grandfather's copper nose on his\nface; very well, think less of Sechard and more of that little rascal.\nI can trust no one but you; you will prevent him from squandering my\nproperty--my poor property.\"\n\n\"But, dear papa Sechard, your son will be a credit to you, you will\nsee; he will make money and be a rich man one of these days, and wear\nthe Cross of the Legion of Honor at his buttonhole.\"\n\n\"What is he going to do to get it?\"\n\n\"You will see. But, meanwhile, would a thousand crowns ruin you? A\nthousand crowns would put an end to the proceedings. Well, if you\ncannot trust him, lend the money to me; I will pay it back; you could\nmake it a charge on my portion, on my earnings----\"\n\n\"Then has some one brought David into a court of law?\" cried the\nvinedresser, amazed to find that the gossip was really true. \"See what\ncomes of knowing how to write your name! And how about my rent! Oh!\nlittle girl, I must go to Angouleme at once and ask Cachan's advice,\nand see that I am straight. You did right well to come over.\nForewarned is forearmed.\"\n\nAfter two hours of argument Eve was fain to go, defeated by the\nunanswerable _dictum_, \"Women never understand business.\" She had come\nwith a faint hope, she went back again almost heartbroken, and reached\nhome just in time to receive notice of judgment; Sechard must pay\nMetivier in full. The appearance of a bailiff at a house door is an\nevent in a country town, and Doublon had come far too often of late.\nThe whole neighborhood was talking about the Sechards. Eve dared not\nleave her house; she dreaded to hear the whispers as she passed.\n\n\"Oh! my brother, my brother!\" cried poor Eve, as she hurried into the\npassage and up the stairs, \"I can never forgive you, unless it\nwas----\"\n\n\"Alas! it was that, or suicide,\" said David, who had followed her.\n\n\"Let us say no more about it,\" she said quietly. \"The woman who\ndragged him down into the depths of Paris has much to answer for; and\nyour father, my David, is quite inexorable! Let us bear it in\nsilence.\"\n\nA discreet rapping at the door cut short some word of love on David's\nlips. Marion appeared, towing the big, burly Kolb after her across the\nouter room.\n\n\"Madame,\" said Marion, \"we have known, Kolb and I, that you and the\nmaster were very much put about; and as we have eleven hundred francs\nof savings between us, we thought we could not do better than put them\nin the mistress' hands----\"\n\n\"Die misdress,\" echoed Kolb fervently.\n\n\"Kolb,\" cried David, \"you and I will never part. Pay a thousand francs\non account to Maitre Cachan, and take a receipt for it; we will keep\nthe rest. And, Kolb, no power on earth must extract a word from you as\nto my work, or my absences from home, or the things you may see me\nbring back; and if I send you to look for plants for me, you know, no\nhuman being must set eyes on you. They will try to corrupt you, my\ngood Kolb; they will offer you thousands, perhaps tens of thousands of\nfrancs, to tell----\"\n\n\"Dey may offer me millions,\" cried Kolb, \"but not ein vort from me\nshall dey traw. Haf I not peen in der army, and know my orders?\"\n\n\"Well, you are warned. March, and ask M. Petit-Claud to go with you as\nwitness.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said the Alsacien. \"Some tay I hope to be rich enough to dust\nder chacket of dat man of law. I don't like his gountenance.\"\n\n\"Kolb is a good man, madame,\" said Big Marion; \"he is as strong as a\nTurk, and as meek as a lamb. Just the one that would make a woman\nhappy. It was his notion, too, to invest our savings this way\n--'safings,' as he calls them. Poor man, if he doesn't speak right, he\nthinks right, and I understand him all the same. He has a notion of\nworking for somebody else, so as to save us his keep----\"\n\n\"Surely we shall be rich, if it is only to repay these good folk,\"\nsaid David, looking at his wife.\n\nEve thought it quite simple; it was no surprise to her to find other\nnatures on a level with her own. The dullest--nay, the most\nindifferent--observer could have seen all the beauty of her nature in\nher way of receiving this service.\n\n\"You will be rich some day, dear master,\" said Marion; \"your bread is\nready baked. Your father has just bought another farm, he is putting\nby money for you; that he is.\"\n\nAnd under the circumstances, did not Marion show an exquisite delicacy\nof feeling by belittling, as it were, her kindness in this way?\n\nFrench procedure, like all things human, has its defects;\nnevertheless, the sword of justice, being a two-edged weapon, is\nexcellently adapted alike for attack or defence. Procedure, moreover,\nhas its amusing side; for when opposed, lawyers arrive at an\nunderstanding, as they well may do, without exchanging a word; through\ntheir manner of conducting their case, a suit becomes a kind of war\nwaged on the lines laid down by the first Marshal Biron, who, at the\nsiege of Rouen, it may be remembered, received his son's project for\ntaking the city in two days with the remark, \"You must be in a great\nhurry to go and plant cabbages!\" Let two commanders-in-chief spare\ntheir troops as much as possible, let them imitate the Austrian\ngenerals who give the men time to eat their soup though they fail to\neffect a juncture, and escape reprimand from the Aulic Council; let\nthem avoid all decisive measures, and they shall carry on a war for\never. Maitre Cachan, Petit-Claud, and Doublon, did better than the\nAustrian generals; they took for their example Quintus Fabius\nCunctator--the Austrian of antiquity.\n\nPetit-Claud, malignant as a mule, was not long in finding out all the\nadvantages of his position. No sooner had Boniface Cointet guaranteed\nhis costs than he vowed to lead Cachan a dance, and to dazzle the\npaper manufacturer with a brilliant display of genius in the creation\nof items to be charged to Metivier. Unluckily for the fame of the\nyoung forensic Figaro, the writer of this history is obliged to pass\nover the scene of his exploits in as great a hurry as if he trod on\nburning coals; but a single bill of costs, in the shape of the\nspecimen sent from Paris, will no doubt suffice for the student of\ncontemporary manners. Let us follow the example set us by the\nBulletins of the Grande Armee, and give a summary of Petit-Claud's\nvaliant feats and exploits in the province of pure law; they will be\nthe better appreciated for concise treatment.\n\nDavid Sechard was summoned before the Tribunal of Commerce at\nAngouleme for the 3rd of July, made default, and notice of judgment\nwas served on the 8th. On the 10th, Doublon obtained an execution\nwarrant, and attempted to put in an execution on the 12th. On this\nPetit-Claud applied for an interpleader summons, and served notice on\nMetivier for that day fortnight. Metivier made application for a\nhearing without delay, and on the 19th, Sechard's application was\ndismissed. Hard upon this followed notice of judgment, authorizing the\nissue of an execution warrant on the 22nd, a warrant of arrest on the\n23rd, and bailiff's inventory previous to the execution on the 24th.\nMetivier, Doublon, Cachan & Company were proceeding at this furious\npace, when Petit-Claud suddenly pulled them up, and stayed execution\nby lodging notice of appeal on the Court-Royal. Notice of appeal, duly\nreiterated on the 25th of July, drew Metivier off to Poitiers.\n\n\"Come!\" said Petit-Claud to himself, \"there we are likely to stop for\nsome time to come.\"\n\nNo sooner was the storm passed over to Poitiers, and an attorney\npractising in the Court-Royal instructed to defend the case, than\nPetit-Claud, a champion facing both ways, made application in Mme.\nSechard's name for the immediate separation of her estate from her\nhusband's; using \"all diligence\" (in legal language) to such purpose,\nthat he obtained an order from the court on the 28th, and inserted\nnotice at once in the _Charente Courier_. Now David the lover had\nsettled ten thousand francs upon his wife in the marriage contract,\nmaking over to her as security the fixtures of the printing office and\nthe household furniture; and Petit-Claud therefore constituted Mme.\nSechard her husband's creditor for that small amount, drawing up a\nstatement of her claims on the estate in the presence of a notary on\nthe 1st of August.\n\nWhile Petit-Claud was busy securing the household property of his\nclients, he gained the day at Poitiers on the point of law on which\nthe demurrer and appeals were based. He held that, as the court of the\nSeine had ordered the plaintiff to pay costs of proceedings in the\nParis commercial court, David was so much the less liable for expenses\nof litigation incurred upon Lucien's account. The Court-Royal took\nthis view of the case, and judgment was entered accordingly. David\nSechard was ordered to pay the amount in dispute in the Angouleme\nCourt, less the law expenses incurred in Paris; these Metivier must\npay, and each side must bear its own costs in the appeal to the\nCourt-Royal.\n\nDavid Sechard was duly notified of the result on the 17th of August.\nOn the 18th the judgment took the practical shape of an order to pay\ncapital, interest, and costs, followed up by notice of an execution\nfor the morrow. Upon this Petit-Claud intervened and put in a claim\nfor the furniture as the wife's property duly separated from her\nhusband's; and what was more, Petit-Claud produced Sechard senior upon\nthe scene of action. The old vinegrower had become his client on this\nwise. He came to Angouleme on the day after Eve's visit, and went to\nMaitre Cachan for advice. His son owed him arrears of rent; how could\nhe come by this rent in the scrimmage in which his son was engaged?\n\n\"I am engaged by the other side,\" pronounced Cachan, \"and I cannot\nappear for the father when I am suing the son; but go to Petit-Claud,\nhe is very clever, he may perhaps do even better for you than I should\ndo.\"\n\nCachan and Petit-Claud met at the Court.\n\n\"I have sent you Sechard senior,\" said Cachan; \"take the case for me\nin exchange.\" Lawyers do each other services of this kind in country\ntowns as well as in Paris.\n\nThe day after Sechard senior gave Petit-Claud his confidence, the tall\nCointet paid a visit to his confederate.\n\n\"Try to give old Sechard a lesson,\" he said. \"He is the kind of man\nthat will never forgive his son for costing him a thousand francs or\nso; the outlay will dry up any generous thoughts in his mind, if he\never has any.\"\n\n\"Go back to your vines,\" said Petit-Claud to his new client. \"Your son\nis not very well off; do not eat him out of house and home. I will\nsend for you when the time comes.\"\n\nOn behalf of Sechard senior, therefore, Petit-Claud claimed that the\npresses, being fixtures, were so much the more to be regarded as tools\nand implements of trade, and the less liable to seizure, in that the\nhouse had been a printing office since the reign of Louis XIV. Cachan,\non Metivier's account, waxed indignant at this. In Paris Lucien's\nfurniture had belonged to Coralie, and here again in Angouleme David's\ngoods and chattels all belonged to his wife or his father; pretty\nthings were said in court. Father and son were summoned; such claims\ncould not be allowed to stand.\n\n\"We mean to unmask the frauds intrenched behind bad faith of the most\nformidable kind; here is the defence of dishonesty bristling with the\nplainest and most innocent articles of the Code, and why?--to avoid\nrepayment of three thousand francs; obtained how?--from poor\nMetivier's cash box! And yet there are those who dare to say a word\nagainst bill-discounters! What times we live in! . . . Now, I put it\nto you--what is this but taking your neighbor's money? . . . You will\nsurely not sanction a claim which would bring immorality to the very\ncore of justice!\"\n\nCachan's eloquence produced an effect on the court. A divided judgment\nwas given in favor of Mme. Sechard, the house furniture being held to\nbe her property; and against Sechard senior, who was ordered to pay\ncosts--four hundred and thirty-four francs, sixty-five centimes.\n\n\"It is kind of old Sechard,\" laughed the lawyers; \"he would have a\nfinger in the pie, so let him pay!\"\n\nNotice of judgment was given on the 26th of August; the presses and\nplant could be seized on the 28th. Placards were posted. Application\nwas made for an order empowering them to sell on the spot.\nAnnouncements of the sale appeared in the papers, and Doublon\nflattered himself that the inventory should be verified and the\nauction take place on the 2nd of September.\n\nBy this time David Sechard owed Metivier five thousand two hundred and\nseventy-five francs, twenty-five centimes (to say nothing of\ninterest), by formal judgment confirmed by appeal, the bill of costs\nhaving been duly taxed. Likewise to Petit-Claud he owed twelve hundred\nfrancs, exclusive of the fees, which were left to David's generosity\nwith the generous confidence displayed by the hackney coachman who has\ndriven you so quickly over the road on which you desire to go.\n\nMme. Sechard owed Petit-Claud something like three hundred and fifty\nfrancs and fees besides; and of old Sechard, besides four hundred and\nthirty-four francs, sixty-five centimes, the little attorney demanded\na hundred crowns by way of fee. Altogether, the Sechard family owed\nabout ten thousand francs. This is what is called \"putting fire into\nthe bed straw.\"\n\nApart from the utility of these documents to other nations who thus\nmay behold the battery of French law in action, the French legislator\nought to know the lengths to which the abuse of procedure may be\ncarried, always supposing that the said legislator can find time for\nreading. Surely some sort of regulation might be devised, some way of\nforbidding lawyers to carry on a case until the sum in dispute is more\nthan eaten up in costs? Is there not something ludicrous in the idea\nof submitting a square yard of soil and an estate of thousands of\nacres to the same legal formalities? These bare outlines of the\nhistory of the various stages of procedure should open the eyes of\nFrenchmen to the meaning of the words \"legal formalities, justice, and\ncosts,\" little as the immense majority of the nations know about them.\n\nFive thousand pounds' weight of type in the printing office were worth\ntwo thousand francs as old metal; the three presses were valued at six\nhundred francs; the rest of the plant would fetch the price of old\niron and firewood. The household furniture would have brought in a\nthousand francs at most. The whole personal property of Sechard junior\ntherefore represented the sum of four thousand francs; and Cachan and\nPetit-Claud made claims for seven thousand francs in costs already\nincurred, to say nothing of expenses to come, for the blossom gave\npromise of fine fruits enough, as the reader will shortly see. Surely\nthe lawyers of France and Navarre, nay, even of Normandy herself, will\nnot refuse Petit-Claud his meed of admiration and respect? Surely,\ntoo, kind hearts will give Marion and Kolb a tear of sympathy?\n\nAll through the war Kolb sat on a chair in the doorway, acting as\nwatch-dog, when David had nothing else for him to do. It was Kolb who\nreceived all the notifications, and a clerk of Petit-Claud's kept\nwatch over Kolb. No sooner were the placards announcing the auction\nput up on the premises than Kolb tore them down; he hurried round the\ntown after the bill-poster, tearing the placards from the walls.\n\n\"Ah, scountrels!\" he cried, \"to dorment so goot a man; and they calls\nit chustice!\"\n\nMarion made half a franc a day by working half time in a paper mill as\na machine tender, and her wages contributed to the support of the\nhousehold. Mme. Chardon went back uncomplainingly to her old\noccupation, sitting up night after night, and bringing home her wages\nat the end of the week. Poor Mme. Chardon! Twice already she had made\na nine days' prayer for those she loved, wondering that God should be\ndeaf to her petitions, and blind to the light of the candles on His\naltar.\n\nOn the 2nd of September, a letter came from Lucien, the first since\nthe letter of the winter, which David had kept from his wife's\nknowledge--the announcement of the three bills which bore David's\nsignature. This time Lucien wrote to Eve.\n\n\"The third since he left us!\" she said. Poor sister, she was afraid to\nopen the envelope that covered the fatal sheet.\n\nShe was feeding the little one when the post came in; they could not\nafford a wet-nurse now, and the child was being brought up by hand.\nHer state of mind may be imagined, and David's also, when he had been\nroused to read the letter, for David had been at work all night, and\nonly lay down at daybreak.\n\n\n               _Lucien to Eve._\n\n                                                \"PARIS, August 29th.\n\n  \"MY DEAR SISTER,--Two days ago, at five o'clock in the morning,\n  one of God's noblest creatures breathed her last in my arms; she\n  was the one woman on earth capable of loving me as you and mother\n  and David love me, giving me besides that unselfish affection,\n  something that neither mother nor sister can give--the utmost\n  bliss of love. Poor Coralie, after giving up everything for my\n  sake, may perhaps have died for me--for me, who at this moment\n  have not the wherewithal to bury her. She could have solaced my\n  life; you, and you alone, my dear good angels, can console me for\n  her death. God has forgiven her, I think, the innocent girl, for\n  she died like a Christian. Oh, this Paris! Eve, Paris is the glory\n  and the shame of France. Many illusions I have lost here already,\n  and I have others yet to lose, when I begin to beg for the little\n  money needed before I can lay the body of my angel in consecrated\n  earth.\n                                     \"Your unhappy brother,\n                                                           \"Lucien.\"\n\n  \"P. S. I must have given you much trouble by my heedlessness; some\n  day you will know all, and you will forgive me. You must be quite\n  easy now; a worthy merchant, a M. Camusot, to whom I once caused\n  cruel pangs, promised to arrange everything, seeing that Coralie\n  and I were so much distressed.\"\n\n\n\"The sheet is still moist with his tears,\" said Eve, looking at the\nletter with a heart so full of sympathy that something of the old love\nfor Lucien shone in her eyes.\n\n\"Poor fellow, he must have suffered cruelly if he has been loved as he\nsays!\" exclaimed Eve's husband, happy in his love; and these two\nforgot all their own troubles at this cry of a supreme sorrow. Just at\nthat moment Marion rushed in.\n\n\"Madame,\" she panted, \"here they are! Here they are!\"\n\n\"Who is here?\"\n\n\"Doublon and his men, bad luck to them! Kolb will not let them come\nin; they have come to sell us up.\"\n\n\"No, no, they are not going to sell you up, never fear,\" cried a voice\nin the next room, and Petit-Claud appeared upon the scene. \"I have\njust lodged notice of appeal. We ought not to sit down under a\njudgment that attaches a stigma of bad faith to us. I did not think it\nworth while to fight the case here. I let Cachan talk to gain time for\nyou; I am sure of gaining the day at Poitiers----\"\n\n\"But how much will it cost to win the day?\" asked Mme. Sechard.\n\n\"Fees if you win, one thousand francs if we lose our case.\"\n\n\"Oh, dear!\" cried poor Eve; \"why, the remedy is worse than the\ndisease!\"\n\nPetit-Claud was not a little confused at this cry of innocence\nenlightened by the progress of the flames of litigation. It struck him\ntoo that Eve was a very beautiful woman. In the middle of the\ndiscussion old Sechard arrived, summoned by Petit-Claud. The old man's\npresence in the chamber where his little grandson in the cradle lay\nsmiling at misfortune completed the scene. The young attorney at once\naddressed the newcomer with:\n\n\"You owe me seven hundred francs for the interpleader, Papa Sechard;\nbut you can charge the amount to your son in addition to the arrears\nof rent.\"\n\nThe vinedresser felt the sting of the sarcasm conveyed by\nPetit-Claud's tone and manner.\n\n\"It would have cost you less to give security for the debt at first,\"\nsaid Eve, leaving the cradle to greet her father-in-law with a kiss.\n\nDavid, quite overcome by the sight of the crowd outside the house (for\nKolb's resistance to Doublon's men had collected a knot of people),\ncould only hold out a hand to his father; he did not say a word.\n\n\"And how, pray, do I come to owe you seven hundred francs?\" the old\nman asked, looking at Petit-Claud.\n\n\"Why, in the first place, I am engaged by you. Your rent is in\nquestion; so, as far as I am concerned, you and our debtor are one and\nthe same person. If your son does not pay my costs in the case, you\nmust pay them yourself.--But this is nothing. In a few hours David\nwill be put in prison; will you allow him to go?\"\n\n\"What does he owe?\"\n\n\"Something like five or six thousand francs, besides the amounts owing\nto you and to his wife.\"\n\nThe speech roused all the old man's suspicions at once. He looked\nround the little blue-and-white bedroom at the touching scene before\nhis eyes--at a beautiful woman weeping over a cradle, at David bowed\ndown by anxieties, and then again at the lawyer. This was a trap set\nfor him by that lawyer; perhaps they wanted to work upon his paternal\nfeelings, to get money out of him? That was what it all meant. He took\nalarm. He went over to the cradle and fondled the child, who held out\nboth little arms to him. No heir to an English peerage could be more\ntenderly cared for than this little one in that house of trouble; his\nlittle embroidered cap was lined with pale pink.\n\n\"Eh! let David get out of it as best he may. I am thinking of this\nchild here,\" cried the old grandfather, \"and the child's mother will\napprove of that. David that knows so much must know how to pay his\ndebts.\"\n\n\"Now I will just put your meaning into plain language,\" said\nPetit-Claud ironically. \"Look here, Papa Sechard, you are jealous of\nyour son. Hear the truth! you put David into his present position by\nselling the business to him for three times its value. You ruined him\nto make an extortionate bargain! Yes, don't you shake your head; you\nsold the newspaper to the Cointets and pocketed all the proceeds, and\nthat was as much as the whole business was worth. You bear David a\ngrudge, not merely because you have plundered him, but because, also,\nyour own son is a man far above yourself. You profess to be\nprodigiously fond of your grandson, to cloak your want of feeling for\nyour son and his wife, because you ought to pay down money _hic et nunc_\nfor them, while you need only show a posthumous affection for your\ngrandson. You pretend to be fond of the little fellow, lest you should\nbe taxed with want of feeling for your own flesh and blood. That is\nthe bottom of it, Papa Sechard.\"\n\n\"Did you fetch me over to hear this?\" asked the old man, glowering at\nhis lawyer, his daughter-in-law, and his son in turn.\n\n\"Monsieur!\" protested poor Eve, turning to Petit-Claud, \"have you\nvowed to ruin us? My husband had never uttered a word against his\nfather.\" (Here the old man looked cunningly at her.) \"David has told\nme scores of times that you loved him in your way,\" she added, looking\nat her father-in-law, and understanding his suspicions.\n\nPetit-Claud was only following out the tall Cointet's instructions. He\nwas widening the breach between the father and son, lest Sechard\nsenior should extricate David from his intolerable position. \"The day\nthat David Sechard goes to prison shall be the day of your\nintroduction to Mme. de Senonches,\" the \"tall Cointet\" had said no\nlonger ago than yesterday.\n\nMme. Sechard, with the quick insight of love, had divined\nPetit-Claud's mercenary hostility, even as she had once before felt\ninstinctively that Cerizet was a traitor. As for David, his\nastonishment may be imagined; he could not understand how Petit-Claud\ncame to know so much of his father's nature and his own history.\nUpright and honorable as he was, he did not dream of the relations\nbetween his lawyer and the Cointets; nor, for that matter, did he know\nthat the Cointets were at work behind Metivier. Meanwhile old Sechard\ntook his son's silence as an insult, and Petit-Claud, taking advantage\nof his client's bewilderment, beat a retreat.\n\n\"Good-bye, my dear David; you have had warning, notice of appeal\ndoesn't invalidate the warrant for arrest. It is the only course left\nopen to your creditors, and it will not be long before they take it.\nSo, go away at once----Or, rather, if you will take my advice, go to\nthe Cointets and see them about it. They have capital. If your\ninvention is perfected and answers the purpose, go into partnership\nwith them. After all, they are very good fellows----\"\n\n\"Your invention?\" broke in old Sechard.\n\n\"Why, do you suppose that your son is fool enough to let his business\nslip away from him without thinking of something else?\" exclaimed the\nattorney. \"He is on the brink of the discovery of a way of making\npaper at a cost of three francs per ream, instead of ten, he tells\nme.\"\n\n\"One more dodge for taking me in! You are all as thick as thieves in a\nfair. If David has found out such a plan, he has no need of me--he is\na millionaire! Good-bye, my dears, and a good-day to you all,\" and the\nold man disappeared down the staircase.\n\n\"Find some way of hiding yourself,\" was Petit-Claud's parting word to\nDavid, and with that he hurried out to exasperate old Sechard still\nfurther. He found the vinegrower growling to himself outside in the\nPlace du Murier, went with him as far as L'Houmeau, and there left him\nwith a threat of putting in an execution for the costs due to him\nunless they were paid before the week was out.\n\n\"I will pay you if you will show me how to disinherit my son without\ninjuring my daughter-in-law or the boy,\" said old Sechard, and they\nparted forthwith.\n\n\"How well the 'tall Cointet' knows the folk he is dealing with! It is\njust as he said; those seven hundred francs will prevent the father\nfrom paying seven thousand,\" the little lawyer thought within himself\nas he climbed the path to Angouleme. \"Still, that old slyboots of a\npaper-maker must not overreach us; it is time to ask him for something\nbesides promises.\"\n\n\n\n\"Well, David dear, what do you mean to do?\" asked Eve, when the lawyer\nhad followed her father-in-law.\n\n\"Marion, put your biggest pot on the fire!\" called David; \"I have my\nsecret fast.\"\n\nAt this Eve put on her bonnet and shawl and walking shoes with\nfeverish haste.\n\n\"Kolb, my friend, get ready to go out,\" she said, \"and come with me;\nif there is any way out of this hell, I must find it.\"\n\nWhen Eve had gone out, Marion spoke to David. \"Do be sensible, sir,\"\nshe said, \"or the mistress will fret herself to death. Make some money\nto pay off your debts, and then you can try to find treasure at your\nease----\"\n\n\"Don't talk, Marion,\" said David; \"I am going to overcome my last\ndifficulty, and then I can apply for the patent and the improvement on\nthe patent at the same time.\"\n\nThis \"improvement on the patent\" is the curse of the French patentee.\nA man may spend ten years of his life in working out some obscure\nindustrial problem; and when he has invented some piece of machinery,\nor made a discovery of some kind, he takes out a patent and imagines\nthat he has a right to his own invention; then there comes a\ncompetitor; and unless the first inventor has foreseen all possible\ncontingencies, the second comer makes an \"improvement on the patent\"\nwith a screw or a nut, and takes the whole thing out of his hands. The\ndiscovery of a cheap material for paper pulp, therefore, is by no\nmeans the conclusion of the whole matter. David Sechard was anxiously\nlooking ahead on all sides lest the fortune sought in the teeth of\nsuch difficulties should be snatched out of his hands at the last.\nDutch paper as flax paper is still called, though it is no longer made\nin Holland, is slightly sized; but every sheet is sized separately by\nhand, and this increases the cost of production. If it were possible\nto discover some way of sizing the paper in the pulping-trough, with\nsome inexpensive glue, like that in use to-day (though even now it is\nnot quite perfect), there would be no \"improvement on the patent\" to\nfear. For the past month, accordingly, David had been making\nexperiments in sizing pulp. He had two discoveries before him.\n\nEve went to see her mother. Fortunately, it so happened that Mme.\nChardon was nursing the deputy-magistrate's wife, who had just given\nthe Milauds of Nevers an heir presumptive; and Eve, in her distrust of\nall attorneys and notaries, took into her head to apply for advice to\nthe legal guardian of widows and orphans. She wanted to know if she\ncould relieve David from his embarrassments by taking them upon\nherself and selling her claims upon the estate, and besides, she had\nsome hope of discovering the truth as to Petit-Claud's unaccountable\nconduct. The official, struck with Mme. Sechard's beauty, received her\nnot only with the respect due to a woman but with a sort of courtesy\nto which Eve was not accustomed. She saw in the magistrate's face an\nexpression which, since her marriage, she had seen in no eyes but\nKolb's; and for a beautiful woman like Eve, this expression is the\ncriterion by which men are judged. When passion, or self-interest, or\nage dims that spark of unquestioning fealty that gleams in a young\nman's eyes, a woman feels a certain mistrust of him, and begins to\nobserve him critically. The Cointets, Cerizet, and Petit-Claud--all\nthe men whom Eve felt instinctively to be her enemies--had turned\nhard, indifferent eyes on her; with the deputy-magistrate, therefore,\nshe felt at ease, although, in spite of his kindly courtesy, he swept\nall her hopes away by his first words.\n\n\"It is not certain, madame, that the Court-Royal will reverse the\njudgment of the court restricting your lien on your husband's\nproperty, for payment of moneys due to you by the terms of your\nmarriage-contract, to household goods and chattels. Your privilege\nought not to be used to defraud the other creditors. But in any case,\nyou will be allowed to take your share of the proceeds with the other\ncreditors, and your father-in-law likewise, as a privileged creditor,\nfor arrears of rent. When the court has given the order, other points\nmay be raised as to the 'contribution,' as we call it, when a schedule\nof the debts is drawn up, and the creditors are paid a dividend in\nproportion to their claims.\n\n\"Then M. Petit-Claud is bringing us to bankruptcy,\" she cried.\n\n\"Petit-Claud is carrying out your husband's instructions,\" said the\nmagistrate; \"he is anxious to gain time, so his attorney says. In my\nopinion, you would perhaps do better to waive the appeal and buy in at\nthe sale the indispensable implements for carrying on the business;\nyou and your father-in-law together might do this, you to the extent\nof your claim through your marriage contract, and he for his arrears\nof rent. But that would be bringing the matter to an end too soon\nperhaps. The lawyers are making a good thing out of your case.\"\n\n\"But then I should be entirely in M. Sechard's father's hands. I\nshould owe him the hire of the machinery as well as the house-rent;\nand my husband would still be open to further proceedings from M.\nMetivier, for M. Metivier would have had almost nothing.\"\n\n\"That is true, madame.\"\n\n\"Very well, then we should be even worse off than we are.\"\n\n\"The arm of the law, madame, is at the creditor's disposal. You have\nreceived three thousand francs, and you must of necessity repay the\nmoney.\"\n\n\"Oh, sir, can you think that we are capable----\" Eve suddenly came to\na stop. She saw that her justification might injure her brother.\n\n\"Oh! I know quite well that it is an obscure affair, that the debtors\non the one side are honest, scrupulous, and even behaving handsomely;\nand the creditor, on the other, is only a cat's-paw----\"\n\nEve, aghast, looked at him with bewildered eyes.\n\n\"You can understand,\" he continued, with a look full of homely\nshrewdness, \"that we on the bench have plenty of time to think over\nall that goes on under our eyes, while the gentlemen in court are\narguing with each other.\"\n\nEve went home in despair over her useless effort. That evening at\nseven o'clock, Doublon came with the notification of imprisonment for\ndebt. The proceedings had reached the acute stage.\n\n\"After this, I can only go out after nightfall,\" said David.\n\nEve and Mme. Chardon burst into tears. To be in hiding was for them a\nshameful thing. As for Kolb and Marion, they were more alarmed for\nDavid because they had long since made up their minds that there was\nno guile in their master's nature; so frightened were they on his\naccount, that they came upstairs under pretence of asking whether they\ncould do anything, and found Eve and Mme. Chardon in tears; the three\nwhose life had been so straightforward hitherto were overcome by the\nthought that David must go into hiding. And how, moreover, could they\nhope to escape the invisible spies who henceforth would dog every\nleast movement of a man, unluckily so absent-minded?\n\n\"Gif montame vill vait ein liddle kvarter hour, she can regonnoitre\nder enemy's camp,\" put in Kolb. \"You shall see dot I oonderstand mein\npizness; for gif I look like ein German, I am ein drue Vrenchman, and\nvat is more, I am ver' conning.\"\n\n\"Oh! madame, do let him go,\" begged Marion. \"He is only thinking of\nsaving his master; he hasn't another thought in his head. Kolb is not\nan Alsacien, he is--eh! well--a regular Newfoundland dog for rescuing\nfolk.\"\n\n\"Go, my good Kolb,\" said David; \"we have still time to do something.\"\n\nKolb hurried off to pay a visit to the bailiff; and it so fell out\nthat David's enemies were in Doublon's office, holding a council as to\nthe best way of securing him.\n\nThe arrest of a debtor is an unheard-of thing in the country, an\nabnormal proceeding if ever there was one. Everybody, in the first\nplace, knows everybody else, and creditor and debtor being bound to\nmeet each other daily all their lives long, nobody likes to take this\nodious course. When a defaulter--to use the provincial term for a\ndebtor, for they do not mince their words in the provinces when\nspeaking of this legalized method of helping yourself to another man's\ngoods--when a defaulter plans a failure on a large scale, he takes\nsanctuary in Paris. Paris is a kind of City of Refuge for provincial\nbankrupts, an almost impenetrable retreat; the writ of the pursuing\nbailiff has no force beyond the limits of his jurisdiction, and there\nare other obstacles rendering it almost invalid. Wherefore the Paris\nbailiff is empowered to enter the house of a third party to seize the\nperson of the debtor, while for the bailiff of the provinces the\ndomicile is absolutely inviolable. The law probably makes this\nexception as to Paris, because there it is the rule for two or more\nfamilies to live under the same roof; but in the provinces the bailiff\nwho wishes to make forcible entry must have an order from the Justice\nof the Peace; and so wide a discretion is allowed the Justice of the\nPeace, that he is practically able to give or withhold assistance to\nthe bailiffs. To the honor of the Justices, it should be said, that\nthey dislike the office, and are by no means anxious to assist blind\npassions or revenge.\n\nThere are, besides, other and no less serious difficulties in the way\nof arrest for debt--difficulties which tend to temper the severity of\nlegislation, and public opinion not infrequently makes a dead letter\nof the law. In great cities there are poor or degraded wretches\nenough; poverty and vice know no scruples, and consent to play the\nspy, but in a little country town, people know each other too well to\nearn wages of the bailiff; the meanest creature who should lend\nhimself to dirty work of this kind would be forced to leave the place.\nIn the absence of recognized machinery, therefore, the arrest of a\ndebtor is a problem presenting no small difficulty; it becomes a kind\nof strife of ingenuity between the bailiff and the debtor, and matter\nfor many pleasant stories in the newspapers.\n\nCointet the elder did not choose to appear in the affair; but the fat\nCointet openly said that he was acting for Metivier, and went to\nDoublon, taking Cerizet with him. Cerizet was his foreman now, and had\npromised his co-operation in return for a thousand-franc note. Doublon\ncould reckon upon two of his understrappers, and thus the Cointets had\nfour bloodhounds already on the victim's track. At the actual time of\narrest, Doublon could furthermore count upon the police force, who are\nbound, if required, to assist a bailiff in the performance of his\nduty. The two men, Doublon himself, and the visitors were all closeted\ntogether in the private office, beyond the public office, on the\nground floor.\n\nA tolerably wide-paved lobby, a kind of passage-way, led to the public\noffice. The gilded scutcheons of the court, with the word \"Bailiff\"\nprinted thereon in large black letters, hung outside on the house wall\non either side the door. Both office windows gave upon the street, and\nwere protected by heavy iron bars; but the private office looked into\nthe garden at the back, wherein Doublon, an adorer of Pomona, grew\nespaliers with marked success. Opposite the office door you beheld the\ndoor of the kitchen, and, beyond the kitchen, the staircase that\nascended to the first story. The house was situated in a narrow street\nat the back of the new Law Courts, then in process of construction,\nand only finished after 1830.--These details are necessary if Kolb's\nadventures are to be intelligible to the reader.\n\nIt was Kolb's idea to go to the bailiff, to pretend to be willing to\nbetray his master, and in this way to discover the traps which would\nbe laid for David. Kolb told the servant who opened the door that he\nwanted to speak to M. Doublon on business. The servant was busy\nwashing up her plates and dishes, and not very well pleased at Kolb's\ninterruption; she pushed open the door of the outer office, and bade\nhim wait there till her master was at liberty; then, as he was a\nstranger to her, she told the master in the private office that \"a\nman\" wanted to speak to him. Now, \"a man\" so invariably means \"a\npeasant,\" that Doublon said, \"Tell him to wait,\" and Kolb took a seat\nclose to the door of the private office. There were voices talking\nwithin.\n\n\"Ah, by the by, how do you mean to set about it? For, if we can catch\nhim to-morrow, it will be so much time saved.\" It was the fat Cointet\nwho spoke.\n\n\"Nothing easier; the gaffer has come fairly by his nickname,\" said\nCerizet.\n\nAt the sound of the fat Cointet's voice, Kolb guessed at once that\nthey were talking about his master, especially as the sense of the\nwords began to dawn upon him; but, when he recognized Cerizet's tones,\nhis astonishment grew more and more.\n\n\"Und dat fellow haf eaten his pread!\" he thought, horror-stricken.\n\n\"We must do it in this way, boys,\" said Doublon. \"We will post our\nmen, at good long intervals, about the Rue de Beaulieu and the Place\ndu Murier in every direction, so that we can follow the gaffer (I like\nthat word) without his knowledge. We will not lose sight of him until\nhe is safe inside the house where he means to lie in hiding (as he\nthinks); there we will leave him in peace for awhile; then some fine\nday we will come across him before sunrise or sunset.\"\n\n\"But what is he doing now, at this moment? He may be slipping through\nour fingers,\" said the fat Cointet.\n\n\"He is in his house,\" answered Doublon; \"if he left it, I should know.\nI have one witness posted in the Place du Murier, another at the\ncorner of the Law Courts, and another thirty paces from the house. If\nour man came out, they would whistle; he could not make three paces\nfrom his door but I should know of it at once from the signal.\"\n\n(Bailiffs speak of their understrappers by the polite title of\n\"witnesses.\")\n\nHere was better hap than Kolb had expected! He went noiselessly out of\nthe office, and spoke to the maid in the kitchen.\n\n\"Meestair Touplon ees encaged for som time to kom,\" he said; \"I vill\nkom back early to-morrow morning.\"\n\nA sudden idea had struck the Alsacien, and he proceeded to put it into\nexecution. Kolb had served in a cavalry regiment; he hurried off to\nsee a livery stable-keeper, an acquaintance of his, picked out a\nhorse, had it saddled, and rushed back to the Place du Murier. He\nfound Madame Eve in the lowest depths of despondency.\n\n\"What is it, Kolb?\" asked David, when the Alsacien's face looked in\nupon them, scared but radiant.\n\n\"You have scountrels all arount you. De safest way ees to hide de\nmaster. Haf montame thought of hiding the master anywheres?\"\n\nWhen Kolb, honest fellow, had explained the whole history of Cerizet's\ntreachery, of the circle traced about the house, and of the fat\nCointet's interest in the affair, and given the family some inkling of\nthe schemes set on foot by the Cointets against the master,--then\nDavid's real position gradually became fatally clear.\n\n\"It is the Cointet's doing!\" cried poor Eve, aghast at the news;\n\"_they_ are proceeding against you! that accounts for Metivier's\nhardness. . . . They are paper-makers--David! they want your secret!\"\n\n\"But what can we do to escape them?\" exclaimed Mme. Chardon.\n\n\"If de misdress had some liddle blace vere the master could pe\nhidden,\" said Kolb; \"I bromise to take him dere so dot nopody shall\nknow.\"\n\n\"Wait till nightfall, and go to Basine Clerget,\" said Eve. \"I will go\nnow and arrange it all with her. In this case, Basine will be like\nanother self to me.\"\n\n\"Spies will follow you,\" David said at last, recovering some presence\nof mind. \"How can we find a way of communicating with Basine if none\nof us can go to her?\"\n\n\"Montame kan go,\" said Kolb. \"Here ees my scheme--I go out mit der\nmaster, ve draws der vischtlers on our drack. Montame kan go to\nMontemoiselle Clerchet; nopody vill vollow her. I haf a horse; I take\nde master oop behint; und der teufel is in it if they katches us.\"\n\n\"Very well; good-bye, dear,\" said poor Eve, springing to her husband's\narms; \"none of us can go to see you, the risk is too great. We must\nsay good-bye for the whole time that your imprisonment lasts. We will\nwrite to each other; Basine will post your letters, and I will write\nunder cover to her.\"\n\nNo sooner did David and Kolb come out of the house than they heard a\nsharp whistle, and were followed to the livery stable. Once there,\nKolb took his master up behind him, with a caution to keep tight hold.\n\n\"Veestle avay, mind goot vriends! I care not von rap,\" cried Kolb.\n\"You vill not datch an old trooper,\" and the old cavalry man clapped\nboth spurs to his horse, and was out into the country and the darkness\nnot merely before the spies could follow, but before they had time to\ndiscover the direction that he took.\n\nEve meanwhile went out on the tolerably ingenious pretext of asking\nadvise of Postel, sat awhile enduring the insulting pity that spends\nitself in words, left the Postel family, and stole away unseen to\nBasine Clerget, told her troubles, and asked for help and shelter.\nBasine, for greater safety, had brought Eve into her bedroom, and now\nshe opened the door of a little closet, lighted only by a skylight in\nsuch a way that prying eyes could not see into it. The two friends\nunstopped the flue which opened into the chimney of the stove in the\nworkroom, where the girls heated their irons. Eve and Basine spread\nragged coverlets over the brick floor to deaden any sound that David\nmight make, put in a truckle bed, a stove for his experiments, and a\ntable and a chair. Basine promised to bring food in the night; and as\nno one had occasion to enter her room, David might defy his enemies\none and all, or even detectives.\n\n\"At last!\" Eve said, with her arms about her friend, \"at last he is in\nsafety.\"\n\nEve went back to Postel to submit a fresh doubt that had occurred to\nher, she said. She would like the opinion of such an experienced\nmember of the Chamber of Commerce; she so managed that he escorted her\nhome, and listened patiently to his commiseration.\n\n\"Would this have happened if you had married me?\"--all the little\ndruggist's remarks were pitched in this key.\n\nThen he went home again to find Mme. Postel jealous of Mme. Sechard,\nand furious with her spouse for his polite attention to that beautiful\nwoman. The apothecary advanced the opinion that little red-haired\nwomen were preferable to tall, dark women, who, like fine horses, were\nalways in the stable, he said. He gave proofs of his sincerity, no\ndoubt, for Mme. Postel was very sweet to him next day.\n\n\"We may be easy,\" Eve said to her mother and Marion, whom she found\nstill \"in a taking,\" in the latter's phrase.\n\n\"Oh! they are gone,\" said Marion, when Eve looked unthinkingly round\nthe room.\n\n\n\nOne league out of Angouleme on the main road to Paris, Kolb stopped.\n\n\"Vere shall we go?\"\n\n\"To Marsac,\" said David; \"since we are on the way already, I will try\nonce more to soften my father's heart.\"\n\n\"I would rader mount to der assault of a pattery,\" said Kolb, \"your\nresbected fader haf no heart whatefer.\"\n\nThe ex-pressman had no belief in his son; he judged him from the\noutside point of view, and waited for results. He had no idea, to\nbegin with, that he had plundered David, nor did he make allowance for\nthe very different circumstances under which they had begun life; he\nsaid to himself, \"I set him up with a printing-house, just as I found\nit myself; and he, knowing a thousand times more than I did, cannot\nkeep it going.\" He was mentally incapable of understanding his son; he\nlaid the blame of failure upon him, and even prided himself, as it\nwere on his superiority to a far greater intellect than his own, with\nthe thought, \"I am securing his bread for him.\"\n\nMoralists will never succeed in making us comprehend the full extent\nof the influence of sentiment upon self-interest, an influence every\nwhit as strong as the action of interest upon our sentiments; for\nevery law of our nature works in two ways, and acts and reacts upon\nus.\n\nDavid, on his side, understood his father, and in his sublime charity\nforgave him. Kolb and David reached Marsac at eight o'clock, and\nsuddenly came in upon the old man as he was finishing his dinner,\nwhich, by force of circumstances, came very near bedtime.\n\n\"I see you because there is no help for it,\" said old Sechard with a\nsour smile.\n\n\"Und how should you and mein master meet? He soars in der shkies, and\nyou are always mit your vines! You bay for him, that's vot you are a\nfader for----\"\n\n\"Come, Kolb, off with you. Put up the horse at Mme. Courtois' so as to\nsave inconvenience here; fathers are always in the right, remember\nthat.\"\n\nKolb went off, growling like a chidden dog, obedient but protesting;\nand David proposed to give his father indisputable proof of his\ndiscovery, while reserving his secret. He offered to give him an\ninterest in the affair in return for money paid down; a sufficient sum\nto release him from his present difficulties, with or without a\nfurther amount of capital to be employed in developing the invention.\n\n\"And how are you going to prove to me that you can make good paper\nthat costs nothing out of nothing, eh?\" asked the ex-printer, giving\nhis son a glance, vinous, it may be, but keen, inquisitive, and\ncovetous; a look like a flash of lightning from a sodden cloud; for\nthe old \"bear,\" faithful to his traditions, never went to bed without\na nightcap, consisting of a couple of bottles of excellent old wine,\nwhich he \"tippled down\" of an evening, to use his own expression.\n\n\"Nothing simpler,\" said David; \"I have none of the paper about me, for\nI came here to be out of Doublon's way; and having come so far, I\nthought I might as well come to you at Marsac as borrow of a\nmoney-lender. I have nothing on me but my clothes. Shut me up somewhere\non the premises, so that nobody can come in and see me at work, and----\"\n\n\"What? you will not let me see you at your work then?\" asked the old\nman, with an ugly look at his son.\n\n\"You have given me to understand plainly, father, that in matters of\nbusiness there is no question of father and son----\"\n\n\"Ah! you distrust the father that gave you life!\"\n\n\"No; the other father who took away the means of earning a\nlivelihood.\"\n\n\"Each for himself, you are right!\" said the old man. \"Very good, I\nwill put you in the cellar.\"\n\n\"I will go down there with Kolb. You must let me have a large pot for\nmy pulp,\" said David; then he continued, without noticing the quick\nlook his father gave him,--\"and you must find artichoke and asparagus\nstalks for me, and nettles, and the reeds that you cut by the stream\nside, and to-morrow morning I will come out of your cellar with some\nsplendid paper.\"\n\n\"If you can do that,\" hiccoughed the \"bear,\" \"I will let you have,\nperhaps--I will see, that is, if I can let you have--pshaw!\ntwenty-five thousand francs. On condition, mind, that you make as\nmuch for me every year.\"\n\n\"Put me to the proof, I am quite willing,\" cried David. \"Kolb! take\nthe horse and go to Mansle, quick, buy a large hair sieve for me of a\ncooper, and some glue of the grocer, and come back again as soon as\nyou can.\"\n\n\"There! drink,\" said old Sechard, putting down a bottle of wine, a\nloaf, and the cold remains of the dinner. \"You will need your\nstrength. I will go and look for your bits of green stuff; green rags\nyou use for your pulp, and a trifle too green, I am afraid.\"\n\nTwo hours later, towards eleven o'clock that night, David and Kolb\ntook up their quarters in a little out-house against the cellar wall;\nthey found the floor paved with runnel tiles, and all the apparatus\nused in Angoumois for the manufacture of Cognac brandy.\n\n\"Pans and firewood! Why, it is as good as a factory made on purpose!\"\ncried David.\n\n\"Very well, good-night,\" said old Sechard; \"I shall lock you in, and\nlet both the dogs loose; nobody will bring you any paper, I am sure.\nYou show me those sheets to-morrow, and I give you my word I will be\nyour partner and the business will be straightforward and properly\nmanaged.\"\n\nDavid and Kolb, locked into the distillery, spent nearly two hours in\nmacerating the stems, using a couple of logs for mallets. The fire\nblazed up, the water boiled. About two o'clock in the morning, Kolb\nheard a sound which David was too busy to notice, a kind of deep\nbreath like a suppressed hiccough. Snatching up one of the two lighted\ndips, he looked round the walls, and beheld old Sechard's empurpled\ncountenance filling up a square opening above a door hitherto hidden\nby a pile of empty casks in the cellar itself. The cunning old man had\nbrought David and Kolb into his underground distillery by the outer\ndoor, through which the casks were rolled when full. The inner door\nhad been made so that he could roll his puncheons straight from the\ncellar into the distillery, instead of taking them round through the\nyard.\n\n\"Aha! thees eies not fair blay, you vant to shvindle your son!\" cried\nthe Alsacien. \"Do you kow vot you do ven you trink ein pottle of vine?\nYou gif goot trink to ein bad scountrel.\"\n\n\"Oh, father!\" cried David.\n\n\"I came to see if you wanted anything,\" said old Sechard, half sobered\nby this time.\n\n\"Und it was for de inderest vot you take in us dot you brought der\nliddle ladder!\" commented Kolb, as he pushed the casks aside and flung\nopen the door; and there, in fact, on a short step-ladder, the old man\nstood in his shirt.\n\n\"Risking your health!\" said David.\n\n\"I think I must be walking in my sleep,\" said old Sechard, coming down\nin confusion. \"Your want of confidence in your father set me dreaming;\nI dreamed you were making a pact with the Devil to do impossible\nthings.\"\n\n\"Der teufel,\" said Kolb; \"dot is your own bassion for de liddle\ngoldfinches.\"\n\n\"Go back to bed again, father,\" said David; \"lock us in if you will,\nbut you may save yourself the trouble of coming down again. Kolb will\nmount guard.\"\n\nAt four o'clock in the morning David came out of the distillery; he\nhad been careful to leave no sign of his occupation behind him; but he\nbrought out some thirty sheets of paper that left nothing to be\ndesired in fineness, whiteness, toughness, and strength, all of them\nbearing by way of water-mark the impress of the uneven hairs of the\nsieve. The old man took up the samples and put his tongue to them, the\nlifelong habit of the pressman, who tests papers in this way. He felt\nit between his thumb and finger, crumpled and creased it, put it\nthrough all the trials by which a printer assays the quality of a\nsample submitted to him, and when it was found wanting in no respect,\nhe still would not allow that he was beaten.\n\n\"We have yet to know how it takes an impression,\" he said, to avoid\npraising his son.\n\n\"Funny man!\" exclaimed Kolb.\n\nThe old man was cool enough now. He cloaked his feigned hesitation\nwith paternal dignity.\n\n\"I wish to tell you in fairness, father, that even now it seems to me\nthat paper costs more than it ought to do; I want to solve the problem\nof sizing it in the pulping-trough. I have just that one improvement\nto make.\"\n\n\"Oho! so you are trying to trick me!\"\n\n\"Well, shall I tell you? I can size the pulp as it is, but so far I\ncannot do it evenly, and the surface is as rough as a burr!\"\n\n\"Very good, size your pulp in the trough, and you shall have my\nmoney.\"\n\n\"Mein master will nefer see de golor of your money,\" declared Kolb.\n\n\"Father,\" he began, \"I have never borne you any grudge for making over\nthe business to me at such an exorbitant valuation; I have seen the\nfather through it all. I have said to myself--'The old man has worked\nvery hard, and he certainly gave me a better bringing up than I had a\nright to expect; let him enjoy the fruits of his toil in peace, and in\nhis own way.--I even gave up my mother's money to you. I began\nencumbered with debt, and bore all the burdens that you put upon me\nwithout a murmur. Well, harassed for debts that were not of my making,\nwith no bread in the house, and my feet held to the flames, I have\nfound out the secret. I have struggled on patiently till my strength\nis exhausted. It is perhaps your duty to help me, but do not give _me_\na thought; think of a woman and a little one\" (David could not keep\nback the tears at this); \"think of them, and give them help and\nprotection.--Kolb and Marion have given me their savings; will you do\nless?\" he cried at last, seeing that his father was as cold as the\nimpression-stone.\n\n\"And that was not enough for you,\" said the old man, without the\nslightest sense of shame; \"why, you would waste the wealth of the\nIndies! Good-night! I am too ignorant to lend a hand in schemes got up\non purpose to exploit me. A monkey will never gobble down a bear\"\n(alluding to the workshop nicknames); \"I am a vinegrower, I am not a\nbanker. And what is more, look you, business between father and son\nnever turns out well. Stay and eat your dinner here; you shan't say\nthat you came for nothing.\"\n\nThere are some deep-hearted natures that can force their own pain down\ninto inner depths unsuspected by those dearest to them; and with them,\nwhen anguish forces its way to the surface and is visible, it is only\nafter a mighty upheaval. David's nature was one of these. Eve had\nthoroughly understood the noble character of the man. But now that the\ndepths had been stirred, David's father took the wave of anguish that\npassed over his son's features for a child's trick, an attempt to \"get\nround\" his father, and his bitter grief for mortification over the\nfailure of the attempt. Father and son parted in anger.\n\nDavid and Kolb reached Angouleme on the stroke of midnight. They came\nback on foot, and steathily, like burglars. Before one o'clock in the\nmorning David was installed in the impenetrable hiding-place prepared\nby his wife in Basine Clerget's house. No one saw him enter it, and\nthe pity that henceforth should shelter David was the most resourceful\npity of all--the pity of a work-girl.\n\nKolb bragged that day that he had saved his master on horseback, and\nonly left him in a carrier's van well on the way to Limoges. A\nsufficient provision of raw material had been laid up in Basine's\ncellar, and Kolb, Marion, Mme. Sechard, and her mother had no\ncommunication with the house.\n\nTwo days after the scene at Marsac, old Sechard came hurrying to\nAngouleme and his daughter-in-law. Covetousness had brought him. There\nwere three clear weeks ahead before the vintage began, and he thought\nhe would be on the look-out for squalls, to use his own expression. To\nthis end he took up his quarters in one of the attics which he had\nreserved by the terms of the lease, wilfully shutting his eyes to the\nbareness and want that made his son's home desolate. If they owed him\nrent, they could well afford to keep him. He ate his food from a\ntinned iron plate, and made no marvel at it. \"I began in the same\nway,\" he told his daughter-in-law, when she apologized for the absence\nof silver spoons.\n\nMarion was obliged to run into debt for necessaries for them all. Kolb\nwas earning a franc for daily wage as a brick-layer's laborer; and at\nlast poor Eve, who, for the sake of her husband and child, had\nsacrificed her last resources to entertain David's father, saw that\nshe had only ten francs left. She had hoped to the last to soften the\nold miser's heart by her affectionate respect, and patience, and\npretty attentions; but old Sechard was obdurate as ever. When she saw\nhim turn the same cold eyes on her, the same look that the Cointets\nhad given her, and Petit-Claud and Cerizet, she tried to watch and\nguess old Sechard's intentions. Trouble thrown away! Old Sechard,\nnever sober, never drunk, was inscrutable; intoxication is a double\nveil. If the old man's tipsiness was sometimes real, it was quite\noften feigned for the purpose of extracting David's secret from his\nwife. Sometimes he coaxed, sometimes he frightened his\ndaughter-in-law.\n\n\"I will drink up my property; _I will buy an annuity_,\" he would\nthreaten when Eve told him that she knew nothing.\n\nThe humiliating struggle was wearing her out; she kept silence at\nlast, lest she should show disrespect to her husband's father.\n\n\"But, father,\" she said one day when driven to extremity, \"there is a\nvery simple way of finding out everything. Pay David's debts; he will\ncome home, and you can settle it between you.\"\n\n\"Ha! that is what you want to get out of me, is it?\" he cried. \"It is\nas well to know!\"\n\nBut if Sechard had no belief in his son, he had plenty of faith in the\nCointets. He went to consult them, and the Cointets dazzled him of set\npurpose, telling him that his son's experiments might mean millions of\nfrancs.\n\n\"If David can prove that he has succeeded, I shall not hesitate to go\ninto partnership with him, and reckon his discovery as half the\ncapital,\" the tall Cointet told him.\n\nThe suspicious old man learned a good deal over nips of brandy with\nthe work-people, and something more by questioning Petit-Claud and\nfeigning stupidity; and at length he felt convinced that the Cointets\nwere the real movers behind Metivier; they were plotting to ruin\nSechard's printing establishment, and to lure him (Sechard) on to pay\nhis son's debts by holding out the discovery as a bait. The old man of\nthe people did not suspect that Petit-Claud was in the plot, nor had\nhe any idea of the toils woven to ensnare the great secret. A day came\nat last when he grew angry and out of patience with the\ndaughter-in-law who would not so much as tell him where David was\nhiding; he determined to force the laboratory door, for he had\ndiscovered that David was wont to make his experiments in the workshop\nwhere the rollers were melted down.\n\nHe came downstairs very early one morning and set to work upon the\nlock.\n\n\"Hey! Papa Sechard, what are you doing there?\" Marion called out. (She\nhad risen at daybreak to go to her papermill, and now she sprang\nacross to the workshop.)\n\n\"I am in my own house, am I not?\" said the old man, in some confusion.\n\n\"Oh, indeed, are you turning thief in your old age? You are not drunk\nthis time either----I shall go straight to the mistress and tell her.\"\n\n\"Hold your tongue, Marion,\" said Sechard, drawing two crowns of six\nfrancs each from his pocket. \"There----\"\n\n\"I will hold my tongue, but don't you do it again,\" said Marion,\nshaking her finger at him, \"or all Angouleme shall hear of it.\"\n\nThe old man had scarcely gone out, however, when Marion went up to her\nmistress.\n\n\"Look, madame,\" she said, \"I have had twelve francs out of your\nfather-in-law, and here they are----\"\n\n\"How did you do it?\"\n\n\"What was he wanting to do but to take a look at the master's pots and\npans and stuff, to find out the secret, forsooth. I knew quite well\nthat there was nothing in the little place, but I frightened him and\ntalked as if he were setting about robbing his son, and he gave me\ntwelve francs to say nothing about it.\"\n\nJust at that moment Basine came in radiant, and with a letter for her\nfriend, a letter from David written on magnificent paper, which she\nhanded over when they were alone.\n\n\n  \"MY ADORED EVE,--I am writing to you the first letter on my first\n  sheet of paper made by the new process. I have solved the problem\n  of sizing the pulp in the trough at last. A pound of pulp costs\n  five sous, even supposing that the raw material is grown on good\n  soil with special culture; three francs' worth of sized pulp will\n  make a ream of paper, at twelve pounds to the ream. I am quite\n  sure that I can lessen the weight of books by one-half. The\n  envelope, the letter, and samples enclosed are all manufactured in\n  different ways. I kiss you; you shall have wealth now to add to\n  our happiness, everything else we had before.\"\n\n\n\"There!\" said Eve, handing the samples to her father-in-law, \"when the\nvintage is over let your son have the money, give him a chance to make\nhis fortune, and you shall be repaid ten times over; he has succeeded\nat last!\"\n\nOld Sechard hurried at once to the Cointets. Every sample was tested\nand minutely examined; the prices, from three to ten francs per ream,\nwere noted on each separate slip; some were sized, others unsized;\nsome were of almost metallic purity, others soft as Japanese paper; in\ncolor there was every possible shade of white. If old Sechard and the\ntwo Cointets had been Jews examining diamonds, their eyes could not\nhave glistened more eagerly.\n\n\"Your son is on the right track,\" the fat Cointet said at length.\n\n\"Very well, pay his debts,\" returned old Sechard.\n\n\"By all means, if he will take us into partnership,\" said the tall\nCointet.\n\n\"You are extortioners!\" cried old Sechard. \"You have been suing him\nunder Metivier's name, and you mean me to buy you off; that is the\nlong and the short of it. Not such a fool, gentlemen----\"\n\nThe brothers looked at one another, but they contrived to hide their\nsurprise at the old miser's shrewdness.\n\n\"We are not millionaires,\" said fat Cointet; \"we do not discount bills\nfor amusement. We should think ourselves well off if we could pay\nready money for our bits of accounts for rags, and we still give bills\nto our dealer.\"\n\n\"The experiment ought to be tried first on a much larger scale,\" the\ntall Cointet said coldly; \"sometimes you try a thing with a saucepan\nand succeed, and fail utterly when you experiment with bulk. You\nshould help your son out of difficulties.\"\n\n\"Yes; but when my son is at liberty, would he take me as his partner?\"\n\n\"That is no business of ours,\" said the fat Cointet. \"My good man, do\nyou suppose that when you have paid some ten thousand francs for your\nson, that there is an end of it? It will cost two thousand francs to\ntake out a patent; there will be journeys to Paris; and before going\nto any expense, it would be prudent to do as my brother suggests, and\nmake a thousand reams or so; to try several whole batches to make\nsure. You see, there is nothing you must be so much on your guard\nagainst as an inventor.\"\n\n\"I have a liking for bread ready buttered myself,\" added the tall\nCointet.\n\nAll through that night the old man ruminated over this dilemma--\"If I\npay David's debts, he will be set at liberty, and once set at liberty,\nhe need not share his fortune with me unless he chooses. He knows very\nwell that I cheated him over the first partnership, and he will not\ncare to try a second; so it is to my interest to keep him shut up, the\nwretched boy.\"\n\nThe Cointets knew enough of Sechard senior to see that they should\nhunt in couples. All three said to themselves--\"Experiments must be\ntried before the discovery can take any practical shape. David Sechard\nmust be set at liberty before those experiments can be made; and David\nSechard, set at liberty, will slip through our fingers.\"\n\nEverybody involved, moreover, had his own little afterthought.\n\nPetit-Claud, for instance, said, \"As soon as I am married, I will slip\nmy neck out of the Cointets' yoke; but till then I shall hold on.\"\n\nThe tall Cointet thought, \"I would rather have David under lock and\nkey, and then I should be master of the situation.\"\n\nOld Sechard, too, thought, \"If I pay my son's debts, he will repay me\nwith a 'Thank you!'\"\n\nEve, hard pressed (for the old man threatened now to turn her out of\nthe house), would neither reveal her husband's hiding-place, nor even\nsend proposals of a safe-conduct. She could not feel sure of finding\nso safe a refuge a second time.\n\n\"Set your son at liberty,\" she told her father-in-law, \"and then you\nshall know everything.\"\n\nThe four interested persons sat, as it were, with a banquet spread\nbefore them, none of them daring to begin, each one suspicious and\nwatchful of his neighbor. A few days after David went into hiding,\nPetit-Claud went to the mill to see the tall Cointet.\n\n\"I have done my best,\" he said; \"David has gone into prison of his own\naccord somewhere or other; he is working out some improvement there in\npeace. It is no fault of mine if you have not gained your end; are you\ngoing to keep your promise?\"\n\n\"Yes, if we succeed,\" said the tall Cointet. \"Old Sechard was here\nonly a day or two ago; he came to ask us some questions as to\npaper-making. The old miser has got wind of his son's invention; he\nwants to turn it to his own account, so there is some hope of a\npartnership. You are with the father and the son----\"\n\n\"Be the third person in the trinity and give them up,\" smiled\nPetit-Claud.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Cointet. \"When you have David in prison, or bound to us by\na deed of partnership, you shall marry Mlle. de la Haye.\"\n\n\"Is that your _ultimatum_?\"\n\n\"My _sine qua non_,\" said Cointet, \"since we are speaking in foreign\nlanguages.\"\n\n\"Then here is mine in plain language,\" Petit-Claud said drily.\n\n\"Ah! let us have it,\" answered Cointet, with some curiosity.\n\n\"You will present me to-morrow to Mme. de Sononches, and do something\ndefinite for me; you will keep your word, in short; or I will clear\noff Sechard's debts myself, sell my practice, and go into partnership\nwith him. I will not be duped. You have spoken out, and I am doing the\nsame. I have given proof, give me proof of your sincerity. You have\nall, and I have nothing. If you won't do fairly by me, I know your\ncards, and I shall play for my own hand.\"\n\nThe tall Cointet took his hat and umbrella, his face at the same time\ntaking its Jesuitical expression, and out he went, bidding Petit-Claud\ncome with him.\n\n\"You shall see, my friend, whether I have prepared your way for you,\"\nsaid he.\n\nThe shrewd paper-manufacturer saw his danger at a glance; and saw,\ntoo, that with a man like Petit-Claud it was better to play above\nboard. Partly to be prepared for contingencies, partly to satisfy his\nconscience, he had dropped a word or two to the point in the ear of\nthe ex-consul-general, under the pretext of putting Mlle. de la Haye's\nfinancial position before that gentleman.\n\n\"I have the man for Francoise,\" he had said; \"for with thirty thousand\nfrancs of _dot_, a girl must not expect too much nowadays.\"\n\n\"We will talk it over later on,\" answered Francis du Hautoy,\nex-consul-general. \"Mme. de Senonches' positon has altered very much\nsince Mme. de Bargeton went away; we very likely might marry Francoise\nto some elderly country gentleman.\"\n\n\"She would disgrace herself if you did,\" Cointet returned in his dry\nway. \"Better marry her to some capable, ambitious young man; you could\nhelp him with your influence, and he would make a good position for\nhis wife.\"\n\n\"We shall see,\" said Francis du Hautoy; \"her godmother ought to be\nconsulted first, in any case.\"\n\nWhen M. de Bargeton died, his wife sold the great house in the Rue du\nMinage. Mme. de Senonches, finding her own house scarcely large\nenough, persuaded M. de Senonches to buy the Hotel de Bargeton, the\ncradle of Lucien Chardon's ambitions, the scene of the earliest events\nin his career. Zephirine de Senonches had it in mind to succeed to\nMme. de Bargeton; she, too, would be a kind of queen in Angouleme; she\nwould have \"a salon,\" and be a great lady, in short. There was a\nschism in Angouleme, a strife dating from the late M. de Bargeton's\nduel with M. de Chandour. Some maintained that Louise de Negrepelisse\nwas blameless, others believed in Stanislas de Chandour's scandals.\nMme. de Senonches declared for the Bargetons, and began by winning\nover that faction. Many frequenters of the Hotel de Bargeton had been\nso accustomed for years to their nightly game of cards in the house\nthat they could not leave it, and Mme. de Senonches turned this fact\nto account. She received every evening, and certainly gained all the\nground lost by Amelie de Chandour, who set up for a rival.\n\nFrancis du Hautoy, living in the inmost circle of nobility in\nAngouleme, went so far as to think of marrying Francoise to old M. de\nSeverac, Mme. du Brossard having totally failed to capture that\ngentleman for her daughter; and when Mme. de Bargeton reappeared as\nthe prefect's wife, Zephirine's hopes for her dear goddaughter waxed\nhigh, indeed. The Comtesse du Chatelet, so she argued, would be sure\nto use her influence for her champion.\n\nBoniface Cointet had Angouleme at his fingers' ends; he saw all the\ndifficulties at a glance, and resolved to sweep them out of the way by\na bold stroke that only a Tartuffe's brain could invent. The puny\nlawyer was not a little amused to find his fellow-conspirator keeping\nhis word with him; not a word did Petit-Claud utter; he respected the\nmusings of his companion, and they walked the whole way from the\npaper-mill to the Rue du Minage in silence.\n\n\"Monsieur and madame are at breakfast\"--this announcement met the\nill-timed visitors on the steps.\n\n\"Take in our names, all the same,\" said the tall Cointet; and feeling\nsure of his position, he followed immediately behind the servant and\nintroduced his companion to the elaborately-affected Zephirine, who\nwas breakfasting in company with M. Francis du Hautoy and Mlle. de la\nHaye. M. de Senonches had gone, as usual, for a day's shooting over M.\nde Pimentel's land.\n\n\"M. Petit-Claud is the young lawyer of whom I spoke to you, madame; he\nwill go through the trust accounts when your fair ward comes of age.\"\n\nThe ex-diplomatist made a quick scrutiny of Petit-Claud, who, for his\npart, was looking furtively at the \"fair ward.\" As for Zephirine, who\nheard of the matter for the first time, her surprise was so great that\nshe dropped her fork.\n\nMlle. de la Haye, a shrewish young woman with an ill-tempered face, a\nwaist that could scarcely be called slender, a thin figure, and\ncolorless, fair hair, in spite of a certain little air that she had,\nwas by no means easy to marry. The \"parentage unknown\" on her birth\ncertificate was the real bar to her entrance into the sphere where her\ngodmother's affection stove to establish her. Mlle. de la Haye,\nignorant of her real position, was very hard to please; the richest\nmerchant in L'Houmeau had found no favor in her sight. Cointet saw the\nsufficiently significant expression of the young lady's face at the\nsight of the little lawyer, and turning, beheld a precisely similar\ngrimace on Petit-Claud's countenance. Mme. de Senonches and Francis\nlooked at each other, as if in search of an excuse for getting rid of\nthe visitors. All this Cointet saw. He asked M. du Hautoy for the\nfavor of a few minutes' speech with him, and the pair went together\ninto the drawing-room.\n\n\"Fatherly affection is blinding you, sir,\" he said bluntly. \"You will\nnot find it an easy thing to marry your daughter; and, acting in your\ninterest throughout, I have put you in a position from which you\ncannot draw back; for I am fond of Francoise, she is my ward. Now\n--Petit-Claud knows _everything_! His overweening ambition is a\nguarantee for our dear child's happiness; for, in the first place,\nFrancoise will do as she likes with her husband; and, in the second,\nhe wants your influence. You can ask the new prefect for the post of\ncrown attorney for him in the court here. M. Milaud is definitely\nappointed to Nevers, Petit-Claud will sell his practice, you will have\nno difficulty in obtaining a deputy public prosecutor's place for him;\nand it will not be long before he becomes attorney for the crown,\npresident of the court, deputy, what you will.\"\n\nFrancis went back to the dining-room and behaved charmingly to his\ndaughter's suitor. He gave Mme. de Senonches a look, and brought the\nscene to a close with an invitation to dine with them on the morrow;\nPetit-Claud must come and discuss the business in hand. He even went\ndownstairs and as far as the corner with the visitors, telling\nPetit-Claud that after Cointet's recommendation, both he and Mme. de\nSenonches were disposed to approve all that Mlle. de la Haye's trustee\nhad arranged for the welfare of that little angel.\n\n\"Oh!\" cried Petit-Claud, as they came away, \"what a plain girl! I have\nbeen taken in----\"\n\n\"She looks a lady-like girl,\" returned Cointet, \"and besides, if she\nwere a beauty, would they give her to you? Eh! my dear fellow, thirty\nthousand francs and the influence of Mme. de Senonches and the\nComtesse du Chatelet! Many a small landowner would be wonderfully glad\nof the chance, and all the more so since M. Francis du Hautoy is never\nlikely to marry, and all that he has will go to the girl. Your\nmarriage is as good as settled.\"\n\n\"How?\"\n\n\"That is what I am just going to tell you,\" returned Cointet, and he\ngave his companion an account of his recent bold stroke. \"M. Milaud is\njust about to be appointed attorney for the crown at Nevers, my dear\nfellow,\" he continued; \"sell your practice, and in ten years' time you\nwill be Keeper of the Seals. You are not the kind of a man to draw\nback from any service required of you by the Court.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said Petit-Claud, his zeal stirred by the prospect of\nsuch a career, \"very well, be in the Place du Murier to-morrow at\nhalf-past four; I will see old Sechard in the meantime; we will have a\ndeed of partnership drawn up, and the father and the son shall be\nbound thereby, and delivered to the third person of the trinity\n--Cointet, to wit.\"\n\n\n\nTo return to Lucien in Paris. On the morrow of the loss announced in\nhis letter, he obtained a _visa_ for his passport, bought a stout holly\nstick, and went to the Rue d'Enfer to take a place in the little\nmarket van, which took him as far as Longjumeau for half a franc. He\nwas going home to Angouleme. At the end of the first day's tramp he\nslept in a cowshed, two leagues from Arpajon. He had come no farther\nthan Orleans before he was very weary, and almost ready to break down,\nbut there he found a boatman willing to bring him as far as Tours for\nthree francs, and food during the journey cost him but forty sous.\nFive days of walking brought him from Tours to Poitiers, and left him\nwith but five francs in his pockets, but he summoned up all his\nremaining strength for the journey before him.\n\nHe was overtaken by night in the open country, and had made up his\nmind to sleep out of doors, when a traveling carriage passed by,\nslowly climbing the hillside, and, all unknown to the postilion, the\noccupants, and the servant, he managed to slip in among the luggage,\ncrouching in between two trunks lest he should be shaken off by the\njolting of the carriage--and so he slept.\n\nHe awoke with the sun shining into his eyes, and the sound of voices\nin his ears. The carriage had come to a standstill. Looking about him,\nhe knew that he was at Mansle, the little town where he had waited for\nMme. de Bargeton eighteen months before, when his heart was full of\nhope and love and joy. A group of post-boys eyed him curiously and\nsuspiciously, covered with dust as he was, wedged in among the\nluggage. Lucien jumped down, but before he could speak two travelers\nstepped out of the caleche, and the words died away on his lips; for\nthere stood the new Prefect of the Charente, Sixte du Chatelet, and\nhis wife, Louise de Negrepelisse.\n\n\"Chance gave us a traveling-companion, if we had but known!\" said the\nCountess. \"Come in with us, monsieur.\"\n\nLucien gave the couple a distant bow and a half-humbled half-defiant\nglance; then he turned away into a cross-country road in search of\nsome farmhouse, where he might make a breakfast on milk and bread, and\nrest awhile, and think quietly over the future. He still had three\nfrancs left. On and on he walked with the hurrying pace of fever,\nnoticing as he went, down by the riverside, that the country grew more\nand more picturesque. It was near mid-day when he came upon a sheet of\nwater with willows growing about the margin, and stopped for awhile to\nrest his eyes on the cool, thick-growing leaves; and something of the\ngrace of the fields entered into his soul.\n\nIn among the crests of the willows, he caught a glimpse of a mill\nnear-by on a branch stream, and of the thatched roof of the mill-house\nwhere the house-leeks were growing. For all ornament, the quaint\ncottage was covered with jessamine and honeysuckle and climbing hops,\nand the garden about it was gay with phloxes and tall, juicy-leaved\nplants. Nets lay drying in the sun along a paved causeway raised above\nthe highest flood level, and secured by massive piles. Ducks were\nswimming in the clear mill-pond below the currents of water roaring\nover the wheel. As the poet came nearer he heard the clack of the\nmill, and saw the good-natured, homely woman of the house knitting on\na garden bench, and keeping an eye upon a little one who was chasing\nthe hens about.\n\nLucien came forward. \"My good woman,\" he said, \"I am tired out; I have\na fever on me, and I have only three francs; will you undertake to\ngive me brown bread and milk, and let me sleep in the barn for a week?\nI shall have time to write to my people, and they will either come to\nfetch me or send me money.\"\n\n\"I am quite willing, always supposing that my husband has no\nobjection.--Hey! little man!\"\n\nThe miller came up, gave Lucien a look over, and took his pipe out of\nhis mouth to remark, \"Three francs for a weeks board? You might as\nwell pay nothing at all.\"\n\n\"Perhaps I shall end as a miller's man,\" thought the poet, as his eyes\nwandered over the lovely country. Then the miller's wife made a bed\nready for him, and Lucien lay down and slept so long that his hostess\nwas frightened.\n\n\"Courtois,\" she said, next day at noon, \"just go in and see whether\nthat young man is dead or alive; he has been lying there these\nfourteen hours.\"\n\nThe miller was busy spreading out his fishing-nets and lines. \"It is\nmy belief,\" he said, \"that the pretty fellow yonder is some starveling\nplay-actor without a brass farthing to bless himself with.\"\n\n\"What makes you think that, little man?\" asked the mistress of the\nmill.\n\n\"Lord, he is not a prince, nor a lord, nor a member of parliament, nor\na bishop; why are his hands as white as if he did nothing?\"\n\n\"Then it is very strange that he does not feel hungry and wake up,\"\nretorted the miller's wife; she had just prepared breakfast for\nyesterday's chance guest. \"A play-actor, is he?\" she continued. \"Where\nwill he be going? It is too early yet for the fair at Angouleme.\"\n\nBut neither the miller nor his wife suspected that (actors, princes,\nand bishops apart) there is a kind of being who is both prince and\nactor, and invested besides with a magnificent order of priesthood\n--that the Poet seems to do nothing, yet reigns over all humanity when\nhe can paint humanity.\n\n\"What can he be?\" Courtois asked of his wife.\n\n\"Suppose it should be dangerous to take him in?\" queried she.\n\n\"Pooh! thieves look more alive than that; we should have been robbed\nby this time,\" returned her spouse.\n\n\"I am neither a prince nor a thief, nor a bishop nor an actor,\" Lucien\nsaid wearily; he must have overheard the colloquy through the window,\nand now he suddenly appeared. \"I am poor, I am tired out, I have come\non foot from Paris. My name is Lucien de Rubempre, and my father was\nM. Chardon, who used to have Postel's business in L'Houmeau. My sister\nmarried David Sechard, the printer in the Place du Murier at\nAngouleme.\"\n\n\"Stop a bit,\" said the miller, \"that printer is the son of the old\nskinflint who farms his own land at Marsac, isn't he?\"\n\n\"The very same,\" said Lucien.\n\n\"He is a queer kind of father, he is!\" Courtois continued. \"He is\nworth two hundred thousand francs and more, without counting his\nmoney-box, and he has sold his son up, they say.\"\n\nWhen body and soul have been broken by a prolonged painful struggle,\nthere comes a crisis when a strong nature braces itself for greater\neffort; but those who give way under the strain either die or sink\ninto unconsciousness like death. That hour of crisis had struck for\nLucien; at the vague rumor of the catastrophe that had befallen David\nhe seemed almost ready to succumb. \"Oh! my sister!\" he cried. \"Oh,\nGod! what have I done? Base wretch that I am!\"\n\nHe dropped down on the wooden bench, looking white and powerless as a\ndying man; the miller's wife brought out a bowl of milk and made him\ndrink, but he begged the miller to help him back to his bed, and asked\nto be forgiven for bringing a dying man into their house. He thought\nhis last hour had come. With the shadow of death, thoughts of religion\ncrossed a brain so quick to conceive picturesque fancies; he would see\nthe cure, he would confess and receive the last sacraments. The moan,\nuttered in the faint voice by a young man with such a comely face and\nfigure, went to Mme. Courtois' heart.\n\n\"I say, little man, just take the horse and go to Marsac and ask Dr.\nMarron to come and see this young man; he is in a very bad way, it\nseems to me, and you might bring the cure as well. Perhaps they may\nknow more about that printer in the Place du Murier than you do, for\nPostel married M. Marron's daughter.\"\n\nCourtois departed. The miller's wife tried to make Lucien take food;\nlike all country-bred folk, she was full of the idea that sick folk\nmust be made to eat. He took no notice of her, but gave way to a\nviolent storm of remorseful grief, a kind of mental process of\ncounter-irritation, which relieved him.\n\nThe Courtois' mill lies a league away from Marsac, the town of the\ndistrict, and the half-way between Mansle and Angouleme; so it was not\nlong before the good miller came back with the doctor and the cure.\nBoth functionaries had heard rumors coupling Lucien's name with the\nname of Mme. de Bargeton; and now when the whole department was\ntalking of the lady's marriage to the new Prefect and her return to\nAngouleme as the Comtesse du Chatelet, both cure and doctor were\nconsumed with a violent curiosity to know why M. de Bargeton's widow\nhad not married the young poet with whom she had left Angouleme. And\nwhen they heard, furthermore, that Lucien was at the mill, they were\neager to know whether the poet had come to the rescue of his\nbrother-in-law. Curiosity and humanity alike prompted them to go at\nonce to the dying man. Two hours after Courtois set out, Lucien heard\nthe rattle of old iron over the stony causeway, the country doctor's\nramshackle chaise came up to the door, and out stepped MM. Marron, for\nthe cure was the doctor's uncle. Lucien's bedside visitors were as\nintimate with David's father as country neighbors usually are in a\nsmall vine-growing township. The doctor looked at the dying man, felt\nhis pulse, and examined his tongue; then he looked at the miller's\nwife, and smiled reassuringly.\n\n\"Mme. Courtois,\" said he, \"if, as I do not doubt, you have a bottle of\ngood wine somewhere in the cellar, and a fat eel in your fish-pond,\nput them before your patient, it is only exhaustion; there is nothing\nthe matter with him. Our great man will be on his feet again\ndirectly.\"\n\n\"Ah! monsieur,\" said Lucien, \"it is not the body, it is the mind that\nails. These good people have told me tidings that nearly killed me; I\nhave just heard the bad news of my sister, Mme. Sechard. Mme. Courtois\nsays that your daughter is married to Postel, monsieur, so you must\nknow something of David Sechard's affairs; oh, for heaven's sake,\nmonsieur, tell me what you know!\"\n\n\"Why, he must be in prison,\" began the doctor; \"his father would not\nhelp him----\"\n\n\"_In prison_!\" repeated Lucien, \"and why?\"\n\n\"Because some bills came from Paris; he had overlooked them, no doubt,\nfor he does not pay much attention to his business, they say,\" said\nDr. Marron.\n\n\"Pray leave me with M. le Cure,\" said the poet, with a visible change\nof countenance. The doctor and the miller and his wife went out of the\nroom, and Lucien was left alone with the old priest.\n\n\"Sir,\" he said, \"I feel that death is near, and I deserve to die. I am\na very miserable wretch; I can only cast myself into the arms of\nreligion. I, sir, _I_ have brought all these troubles on my sister and\nbrother, for David Sechard has been a brother to me. I drew those\nbills that David could not meet! . . . I have ruined him. In my\nterrible misery, I forgot the crime. A millionaire put an end to the\nproceedings, and I quite believed that he had met the bills; but\nnothing of the kind has been done, it seems.\" And Lucien told the tale\nof his sorrows. The story, as he told it in his feverish excitement,\nwas worthy of the poet. He besought the cure to go to Angouleme and to\nask for news of Eve and his mother, Mme. Chardon, and to let him know\nthe truth, and whether it was still possible to repair the evil.\n\n\"I shall live till you come back, sir,\" he added, as the hot tears\nfell. \"If my mother, and sister, and David do not cast me off, I shall\nnot die.\"\n\nLucien's remorse was terrible to see, the tears, the eloquence, the\nyoung white face with the heartbroken, despairing look, the tales of\nsorrow upon sorrow till human strength could no more endure, all these\nthings aroused the cure's pity and interest.\n\n\"In the provinces, as in Paris,\" he said, \"you must believe only half\nof all that you hear. Do not alarm yourself; a piece of hearsay, three\nleagues away from Angouleme, is sure to be far from the truth. Old\nSechard, our neighbor, left Marsac some days ago; very likely he is\nbusy settling his son's difficulties. I am going to Angouleme; I will\ncome back and tell you whether you can return home; your confessions\nand repentance will help to plead your cause.\"\n\nThe cure did not know that Lucien had repented so many times during\nthe last eighteen months, that penitence, however impassioned, had\ncome to be a kind of drama with him, played to perfection, played so\nfar in all good faith, but none the less a drama. To the cure\nsucceeded the doctor. He saw that the patient was passing through a\nnervous crisis, and the danger was beginning to subside. The\ndoctor-nephew spoke as comfortably as the cure-uncle, and at length\nthe patient was persuaded to take nourishment.\n\nMeanwhile the cure, knowing the manners and customs of the\ncountryside, had gone to Mansle; the coach from Ruffec to Angouleme\nwas due to pass about that time, and he found a vacant place in it. He\nwould go to his grand-nephew Postel in L'Houmeau (David's former\nrival) and make inquiries of him. From the assiduity with which the\nlittle druggist assisted his venerable relative to alight from the\nabominable cage which did duty as a coach between Ruffec and\nAngouleme, it was apparent to the meanest understanding that M. and\nMme. Postel founded their hopes of future ease upon the old cure's\nwill.\n\n\"Have you breakfasted? Will you take something? We did not in the\nleast expect you! This is a pleasant surprise!\" Out came questions\ninnumerable in a breath.\n\nMme. Postel might have been born to be the wife of an apothecary in\nL'Houmeau. She was a common-looking woman, about the same height as\nlittle Postel himself, such good looks as she possessed being entirely\ndue to youth and health. Her florid auburn hair grew very low upon her\nforehead. Her demeanor and language were in keeping with homely\nfeatures, a round countenance, the red cheeks of a country damsel, and\neyes that might almost be described as yellow. Everything about her\nsaid plainly enough that she had been married for expectations of\nmoney. After a year of married life, therefore, she ruled the house;\nand Postel, only too happy to have discovered the heiress, meekly\nsubmitted to his wife. Mme. Leonie Postel, _nee_ Marron, was nursing her\nfirst child, the darling of the old cure, the doctor, and Postel, a\nrepulsive infant, with a strong likeness to both parents.\n\n\"Well, uncle,\" said Leonie, \"what has brought you to Angouleme, since\nyou will not take anything, and no sooner come in than you talk of\ngoing?\"\n\nBut when the venerable ecclesiastic brought out the names of David\nSechard and Eve, little Postel grew very red, and Leonie, his wife,\nfelt it incumbent upon her to give him a jealous glance--the glance\nthat a wife never fails to give when she is perfectly sure of her\nhusband, and gives a look into the past by way of a caution for the\nfuture.\n\n\"What have yonder folk done to you, uncle, that you should mix\nyourself up in their affairs?\" inquired Leonie, with very perceptible\ntartness.\n\n\"They are in trouble, my girl,\" said the cure, and he told the Postels\nabout Lucien at the Courtois' mill.\n\n\"Oh! so that is the way he came back from Paris, is it?\" exclaimed\nPostel. \"Yet he had some brains, poor fellow, and he was ambitious,\ntoo. He went out to look for wool, and comes home shorn. But what does\nhe want here? His sister is frightfully poor; for all these geniuses,\nDavid and Lucien alike, know very little about business. There was\nsome talk of him at the Tribunal, and, as judge, I was obliged to sign\nthe warrant of execution. It was a painful duty. I do not know whether\nthe sister's circumstances are such that Lucien can go to her; but in\nany case the little room that he used to occupy here is at liberty,\nand I shall be pleased to offer it to him.\"\n\n\"That is right, Postel,\" said the priest; he bestowed a kiss on the\ninfant slumbering in Leonie's arms, and, adjusting his cocked hat,\nprepared to walk out of the shop.\n\n\"You will dine with us, uncle, of course,\" said Mme. Postel; \"if once\nyou meddle in these people's affairs, it will be some time before you\nhave done. My husband will drive you back again in his little\npony-cart.\"\n\nHusband and wife stood watching their valued, aged relative on his way\ninto Angouleme. \"He carries himself well for his age, all the same,\"\nremarked the druggist.\n\nBy this time David had been in hiding for eleven days in a house only\ntwo doors away from the druggist's shop, which the worthy ecclesiastic\nhad just quitted to climb the steep path into Angouleme with the news\nof Lucien's present condition.\n\nWhen the Abbe Marron debouched upon the Place du Murier he found three\nmen, each one remarkable in his own way, and all of them bearing with\ntheir whole weight upon the present and future of the hapless\nvoluntary prisoner. There stood old Sechard, the tall Cointet, and his\nconfederate, the puny limb of the law, three men representing three\nphases of greed as widely different as the outward forms of the\nspeakers. The first had it in his mind to sell his own son; the\nsecond, to betray his client; and the third, while bargaining for both\niniquities, was inwardly resolved to pay for neither. It was nearly\nfive o'clock. Passers-by on their way home to dinner stopped a moment\nto look at the group.\n\n\"What the devil can old Sechard and the tall Cointet have to say to\neach other?\" asked the more curious.\n\n\"There was something on foot concerning that miserable wretch that\nleaves his wife and child and mother-in-law to starve,\" suggested\nsome.\n\n\"Talk of sending a boy to Paris to learn his trade!\" said a provincial\noracle.\n\n\"M. le Cure, what brings you here, eh?\" exclaimed old Sechard,\ncatching sight of the Abbe as soon as he appeared.\n\n\"I have come on account of your family,\" answered the old man.\n\n\"Here is another of my son's notions!\" exclaimed old Sechard.\n\n\"It would not cost you much to make everybody happy all round,\" said\nthe priest, looking at the windows of the printing-house. Mme.\nSechard's beautiful face appeared at that moment between the curtains;\nshe was hushing her child's cries by tossing him in her arms and\nsinging to him.\n\n\"Are you bringing news of my son?\" asked old Sechard, \"or what is more\nto the purpose--money?\"\n\n\"No,\" answered M. Marron, \"I am bringing the sister news of her\nbrother.\"\n\n\"Of Lucien?\" cried Petit-Claud.\n\n\"Yes. He walked all the way from Paris, poor young man. I found him at\nthe Courtois' house; he was worn out with misery and fatigue. Oh! he\nis very much to be pitied.\"\n\nPetit-Claud took the tall Cointet by the arm, saying aloud, \"If we are\ngoing to dine with Mme. de Senonches, it is time to dress.\" When they\nhad come away a few paces, he added, for his companion's benefit,\n\"Catch the cub, and you will soon have the dam; we have David now----\"\n\n\"I have found you a wife, find me a partner,\" said the tall Cointet\nwith a treacherous smile.\n\n\"Lucien is an old school-fellow of mine; we used to be chums. I shall\nbe sure to hear something from him in a week's time. Have the banns\nput up, and I will engage to put David in prison. When he is on the\njailer's register I shall have done my part.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" exclaimed the tall Cointet under his breath, \"we might have the\npatent taken out in our name; that would be the thing!\"\n\nA shiver ran through the meagre little attorney when he heard those\nwords.\n\nMeanwhile Eve beheld her father-in-law enter with the Abbe Marron, who\nhad let fall a word which unfolded the whole tragedy.\n\n\"Here is our cure, Mme. Sechard,\" the old man said, addressing his\ndaughter-in-law, \"and pretty tales about your brother he has to tell\nus, no doubt!\"\n\n\"Oh!\" cried poor Eve, cut to the heart; \"what can have happened now?\"\n\nThe cry told so unmistakably of many sorrows, of great dread on so\nmany grounds, that the Abbe Marron made haste to say, \"Reassure\nyourself, madame; he is living.\"\n\nEve turned to the vinegrower.\n\n\"Father,\" she said, \"perhaps you will be good enough to go to my\nmother; she must hear all that this gentleman has to tell us of\nLucien.\"\n\nThe old man went in search of Mme. Chardon, and addressed her in this\nwise:\n\n\"Go and have it out with the Abbe Marron; he is a good sort, priest\nthough he is. Dinner will be late, no doubt. I shall come back again\nin an hour,\" and the old man went out. Insensible as he was to\neverything but the clink of money and the glitter of gold, he left\nMme. Chardon without caring to notice the effect of the shock that he\nhad given her.\n\nMme. Chardon had changed so greatly during the last eighteen months,\nthat in that short time she no longer looked like the same woman. The\ntroubles hanging over both of her children, her abortive hopes for\nLucien, the unexpected deterioration in one in whose powers and\nhonesty she had for so long believed,--all these things had told\nheavily upon her. Mme. Chardon was not only noble by birth, she was\nnoble by nature; she idolized her children; consequently, during the\nlast six months she had suffered as never before since her widowhood.\nLucien might have borne the name of Lucien de Rubempre by royal\nletters patent; he might have founded the family anew, revived the\ntitle, and borne the arms; he might have made a great name--he had\nthrown the chance away; nay, he had fallen into the mire!\n\nFor Mme. Chardon the mother was a harder judge than Eve the sister.\nWhen she heard of the bills, she looked upon Lucien as lost. A mother\nis often fain to shut her eyes, but she always knows the child that\nshe held at her breast, the child that has been always with her in the\nhouse; and so when Eve and David discussed Lucien's chances of success\nin Paris, and Lucien's mother to all appearance shared Eve's\nillusions, in her inmost heart there was a tremor of fear lest David\nshould be right, for a mother's consciousness bore a witness to the\ntruth of his words. So well did she know Eve's sensitive nature, that\nshe could not bring herself to speak of her fears; she was obliged to\nchoke them down and keep such silence as mothers alone can keep when\nthey know how to love their children.\n\nAnd Eve, on her side, had watched her mother, and saw the ravages of\nhidden grief with a feeling of dread; her mother was not growing old,\nshe was failing from day to day. Mother and daughter lived a live of\ngenerous deception, and neither was deceived. The brutal old\nvinegrower's speech was the last drop that filled the cup of\naffliction to overflowing. The words struck a chill to Mme. Chardon's\nheart.\n\n\"Here is my mother, monsieur,\" said Eve, and the Abbe, looking up, saw\na white-haired woman with a face as thin and worn as the features of\nsome aged nun, and yet grown beautiful with the calm and sweet\nexpression that devout submission gives to the faces of women who walk\nby the will of God, as the saying is. Then the Abbe understood the\nlives of the mother and daughter, and had no more sympathy left for\nLucien; he shuddered to think of all that the victims had endured.\n\n\"Mother,\" said Eve, drying her eyes as she spoke, \"poor Lucien is not\nvery far away, he is at Marsac.\"\n\n\"And why is he not here?\" asked Mme. Chardon.\n\nThen the Abbe told the whole story as Lucien had told it to him--the\nmisery of the journey, the troubles of the last days in Paris. He\ndescribed the poet's agony of mind when he heard of the havoc wrought\nat home by his imprudence, and his apprehension as to the reception\nawaiting him at Angouleme.\n\n\"He has doubts of us; has it come to this?\" said Mme. Chardon.\n\n\"The unhappy young man has come back to you on foot, enduring the most\nterrible hardships by the way; he is prepared to enter the humblest\nwalks in life--if so he may make reparation.\"\n\n\"Monsieur,\" Lucien's sister said, \"in spite of the wrong he has done\nus, I love my brother still, as we love the dead body when the soul\nhas left it; and even so, I love him more than many sisters love their\nbrothers. He has made us poor indeed; but let him come to us, he shall\nshare the last crust of bread, anything indeed that he has left us.\nOh, if he had never left us, monsieur, we should not have lost our\nheart's treasure.\"\n\n\"And the woman who took him from us brought him back on her carriage!\"\nexclaimed Mme. Chardon. \"He went away sitting by Mme. de Bargeton's\nside in her caleche, and he came back behind it.\"\n\n\"Can I do anything for you?\" asked the good cure, seeking an\nopportunity to take leave.\n\n\"A wound in the purse is not fatal, they say, monsieur,\" said Mme.\nChardon, \"but the patient must be his own doctor.\"\n\n\"If you have sufficient influence with my father-in-law to induce him\nto help his son, you would save a whole family,\" said Eve.\n\n\"He has no belief in you, and he seemed to me to be very much\nexasperated against your husband,\" answered the old cure. He retained\nan impression, from the ex-pressman's rambling talk, that the\nSechards' affairs were a kind of wasps' nest with which it was\nimprudent to meddle, and his mission being fulfilled, he went to dine\nwith his nephew Postel. That worthy, like the rest of Angouleme,\nmaintained that the father was in the right, and soon dissipated any\nlittle benevolence that the old gentleman was disposed to feel towards\nthe son and his family.\n\n\"With those that squander money something may be done,\" concluded\nlittle Postel, \"but those that make experiments are the ruin of you.\"\n\nThe cure went home; his curiosity was thoroughly satisfied, and this\nis the end and object of the exceeding interest taken in other\npeople's business in the provinces. In the course of the evening the\npoet was duly informed of all that had passed in the Sechard family,\nand the journey was represented as a pilgrimage undertaken from\nmotives of the purest charity.\n\n\"You have run your brother-in-law and sister into debt to the amount\nof ten or twelve thousand francs,\" said the Abbe as he drew to an end,\n\"and nobody hereabouts has that trifling amount to lend a neighbor, my\ndear sir. We are not rich in Angoumois. When you spoke to me of your\nbills, I thought that a much smaller amount was involved.\"\n\nLucien thanked the old man for his good offices. \"The promise of\nforgiveness which you have brought is for me a priceless gift.\"\n\nVery early the next morning Lucien set out from Marsac, and reached\nAngouleme towards nine o'clock. He carried nothing but his\nwalking-stick; the short jacket that he wore was considerably the worst\nfor his journey, his black trousers were whitened with dust, and a pair\nof worn boots told sufficiently plainly that their owner belonged to the\nhapless tribe of tramps. He knew well enough that the contrast between\nhis departure and return was bound to strike his fellow-townsmen; he\ndid not try to hide the fact from himself. But just then, with his\nheart swelling beneath the oppression of remorse awakened in him by\nthe old cure's story, he accepted his punishment for the moment, and\nmade up his mind to brave the eyes of his acquaintances. Within\nhimself he said, \"I am behaving heroically.\"\n\nPoetic temperaments of this stamp begin as their own dupes. He walked\nup through L'Houmeau, shame at the manner of his return struggling\nwith the charm of old associations as he went. His heart beat quickly\nas he passed Postel's shop; but, very luckily for him, the only\npersons inside it were Leonie and her child. And yet, vanity was still\nso strong in him, that he could feel glad that his father's name had\nbeen painted out on the shop-front; for Postel, since his marriage,\nhad redecorated his abode, and the word \"Pharmacy\" now alone appeared\nthere, in the Paris fashion, in big letters.\n\nWhen Lucien reached the steps by the Palet Gate, he felt the influence\nof his native air, his misfortunes no longer weighed upon him. \"I\nshall see them again!\" he said to himself, with a thrill of delight.\n\nHe reached the Place du Murier, and had not met a soul, a piece of\nluck that he scarcely hoped for, he who once had gone about his native\nplace with a conqueror's air. Marion and Kolb, on guard at the door,\nflew out upon the steps, crying out, \"Here he is!\"\n\nLucien saw the familiar workshop and courtyard, and on the staircase\nmet his mother and sister, and for a moment, while their arms were\nabout him, all three almost forgot their troubles. In family life we\nalmost always compound with our misfortunes; we make a sort of bed to\nrest upon; and, if it is hard, hope to make it tolerable. If Lucien\nlooked the picture of despair, poetic charm was not wanting to the\npicture. His face had been tanned by the sunlight of the open road,\nand the deep sadness visible in his features overshadowed his poet's\nbrow. The change in him told so plainly of sufferings endured, his\nface was so worn by sharp misery, that no one could help pitying him.\nImagination had fared forth into the world and found sad reality at\nthe home-coming. Eve was smiling in the midst of her joy, as the\nsaints smile upon martyrdom. The face of a young and very fair woman\ngrows sublimely beautiful at the touch of grief; Lucien remembered the\ninnocent girlish face that he saw last before he went to Paris, and\nthe look of gravity that had come over it spoke so eloquently that he\ncould not but feel a painful impression. The first quick, natural\noutpouring of affection was followed at once by a reaction on either\nside; they were afraid to speak; and when Lucien almost involuntarily\nlooked round for another who should have been there, Eve burst into\ntears, and Lucien did the same, but Mme. Chardon's haggard face showed\nno sign of emotion. Eve rose to her feet and went downstairs, partly\nto spare her brother a word of reproach, partly to speak to Marion.\n\n\"Lucien is so fond of strawberries, child, we must find some\nstrawberries for him.\"\n\n\"Oh, I was sure that you would want to welcome M. Lucien; you shall\nhave a nice little breakfast and a good dinner, too.\"\n\n\"Lucien,\" said Mme. Chardon when the mother and son were left alone,\n\"you have a great deal to repair here. You went away that we all might\nbe proud of you; you have plunged us into want. You have all but\ndestroyed your brother's opportunity of making a fortune that he only\ncared to win for the sake of his new family. Nor is this all that you\nhave destroyed----\" said the mother.\n\nThere was a dreadful pause; Lucien took his mother's reproaches in\nsilence.\n\n\"Now begin to work,\" Mme. Chardon went on more gently. \"You tried to\nrevive the noble family of whom I come; I do not blame you for it. But\nthe man who undertakes such a task needs money above all things, and\nmust bear a high heart in him; both were wanting in your case. We\nbelieved in you once, our belief has been shaken. This was a\nhard-working, contented household, making its way with difficulty; you\nhave troubled their peace. The first offence may be forgiven, but it\nmust be the last. We are in a very difficult position here; you must be\ncareful, and take your sister's advice, Lucien. The school of trouble\nis a very hard one, but Eve has learned much by her lessons; she has\ngrown grave and thoughtful, she is a mother. In her devotion to our\ndear David she has taken all the family burdens upon herself; indeed,\nthrough your wrongdoing she has come to be my only comfort.\"\n\n\"You might be still more severe, my mother,\" Lucien said, as he kissed\nher. \"I accept your forgiveness, for I will not need it a second\ntime.\"\n\nEve came into the room, saw her brother's humble attitude, and knew\nthat he had been forgiven. Her kindness brought a smile for him to her\nlips, and Lucien answered with tear-filled eyes. A living presence\nacts like a charm, changing the most hostile positions of lovers or of\nfamilies, no matter how just the resentment. Is it that affection\nfinds out the ways of the heart, and we love to fall into them again?\nDoes the phenomenon come within the province of the science of\nmagnetism? Or is it reason that tells us that we must either forgive\nor never see each other again? Whether the cause be referred to\nmental, physical, or spiritual conditions, everyone knows the effect;\nevery one has felt that the looks, the actions or gestures of the\nbeloved awaken some vestige of tenderness in those most deeply sinned\nagainst and grievously wronged. Though it is hard for the mind to\nforget, though we still smart under the injury, the heart returns to\nits allegiance in spite of all. Poor Eve listened to her brother's\nconfidences until breakfast-time; and whenever she looked at him she\nwas no longer mistress of her eyes; in that intimate talk she could\nnot control her voice. And with the comprehension of the conditions of\nliterary life in Paris, she understood that the struggle had been too\nmuch for Lucien's strength. The poet's delight as he caressed his\nsister's child, his deep grief over David's absence, mingled with joy\nat seeing his country and his own folk again, the melancholy words\nthat he let fall,--all these things combined to make that day a\nfestival. When Marion brought in the strawberries, he was touched to\nsee that Eve had remembered his taste in spite of her distress, and\nshe, his sister, must make ready a room for the prodigal brother and\nbusy herself for Lucien. It was a truce, as it were, to misery. Old\nSechard himself assisted to bring about this revulsion of feeling in\nthe two women--\"You are making as much of him as if he were bringing\nyou any amount of money!\"\n\n\"And what has my brother done that we should not make much of him?\"\ncried Eve, jealously screening Lucien.\n\nNevertheless, when the first expansion was over, shades of truth came\nout. It was not long before Lucien felt the difference between the old\naffection and the new. Eve respected David from the depths of her\nheart; Lucien was beloved for his own sake, as we love a mistress\nstill in spite of the disasters she causes. Esteem, the very\nfoundation on which affection is based, is the solid stuff to which\naffection owes I know not what of certainty and security by which we\nlive; and this was lacking between Mme. Chardon and her son, between\nthe sister and the brother. Mother and daughter did not put entire\nconfidence in him, as they would have done if he had not lost his\nhonor; and he felt this. The opinion expressed in d'Arthez's letter\nwas Eve's own estimate of her brother; unconsciously she revealed it\nby her manner, tones, and gestures. Oh! Lucien was pitied, that was\ntrue; but as for all that he had been, the pride of the household, the\ngreat man of the family, the hero of the fireside,--all this, like\ntheir fair hopes of him, was gone, never to return. They were so\nafraid of his heedlessness that he was not told where David was\nhidden. Lucien wanted to see his brother; but this Eve, insensible to\nthe caresses which accompanied his curious questionings, was not the\nEve of L'Houmeau, for whom a glance from him had been an order that\nmust be obeyed. When Lucien spoke of making reparation, and talked as\nthough he could rescue David, Eve only answered:\n\n\"Do not interfere; we have enemies of the most treacherous and\ndangerous kind.\"\n\nLucien tossed his head, as one who should say, \"I have measured myself\nagainst Parisians,\" and the look in his sister's eyes said\nunmistakably, \"Yes, but you were defeated.\"\n\n\"Nobody cares for me now,\" Lucien thought. \"In the home circle, as in\nthe world without, success is a necessity.\"\n\nThe poet tried to explain their lack of confidence in him; he had not\nbeen at home two days before a feeling of vexation rather than of\nangry bitterness gained hold on him. He applied Parisian standards to\nthe quiet, temperate existence of the provinces, quite forgetting that\nthe narrow, patient life of the household was the result of his own\nmisdoings.\n\n\"They are _bourgeoises_, they cannot understand me,\" he said, setting\nhimself apart from his sister and mother and David, now that they\ncould no longer be deceived as to his real character and his future.\n\nMany troubles and shocks of fortune had quickened the intuitive sense\nin both the women. Eve and Mme. Chardon guessed the thoughts in\nLucien's inmost soul; they felt that he misjudged them; they saw him\nmentally isolating himself.\n\n\"Paris has changed him very much,\" they said between themselves. They\nwere indeed reaping the harvest of egoism which they themselves had\nfostered.\n\nIt was inevitable but that the leaven should work in all three; and\nthis most of all in Lucien, because he felt that he was so heavily to\nblame. As for Eve, she was just the kind of sister to beg an erring\nbrother to \"Forgive me for your trespasses;\" but when the union of two\nsouls had been as perfect since life's very beginnings, as it had been\nwith Eve and Lucien, any blow dealt to that fair ideal is fatal.\nScoundrels can draw knives on each other and make it up again\nafterwards, while a look or a word is enough to sunder two lovers for\never. In the recollection of an almost perfect life of heart and heart\nlies the secret of many an estrangement that none can explain. Two may\nlive together without full trust in their hearts if only their past\nholds no memories of complete and unclouded love; but for those who\nonce have known that intimate life, it becomes intolerable to keep\nperpetual watch over looks and words. Great poets know this; Paul and\nVirginie die before youth is over; can we think of Paul and Virginie\nestranged? Let us know that, to the honor of Lucien and Eve, the grave\ninjury done was not the source of the pain; it was entirely a matter\nof feeling upon either side, for the poet in fault, as for the sister\nwho was in no way to blame. Things had reached the point when the\nslightest misunderstanding, or little quarrel, or a fresh\ndisappointment in Lucien would end in final estrangement. Money\ndifficulties may be arranged, but feelings are inexorable.\n\nNext day Lucien received a copy of the local paper. He turned pale\nwith pleasure when he saw his name at the head of one of the first\n\"leaders\" in that highly respectable sheet, which like the provincial\nacademies that Voltaire compared to a well-bred miss, was never talked\nabout.\n\n\n  \"Let Franche-Comte boast of giving the light to Victor Hugo, to\n  Charles Nodier, and Cuvier,\" ran the article, \"Brittany of\n  producing a Chateaubriand and a Lammenais, Normandy of Casimir\n  Delavigne, and Touraine of the author of _Eloa_; Angoumois that\n  gave birth, in the days of Louis XIII., to our illustrious\n  fellow-countryman Guez, better known under the name of Balzac,\n  our Angoumois need no longer envy Limousin her Dupuytren, nor\n  Auvergne, the country of Montlosier, nor Bordeaux, birthplace of\n  so many great men; for we too have our poet!--The writer of the\n  beautiful sonnets entitled the _Marguerites_ unites his poet's fame\n  to the distinction of a prose writer, for to him we also owe the\n  magnificent romance of _The Archer of Charles IX._ Some day our\n  nephews will be proud to be the fellow-townsmen of Lucien Chardon,\n  a rival of Petrarch!!!\"\n\n\n(The country newspapers of those days were sown with notes of\nadmiration, as reports of English election speeches are studded with\n\"cheers\" in brackets.)\n\n\n  \"In spite of his brilliant success in Paris, our young poet has\n  not forgotten the Hotel de Bargeton, the cradle of his triumphs;\n  nor the fact that the wife of M. le Comte du Chatelet, our\n  Prefect, encouraged his early footsteps in the pathway of the\n  Muses. He has come back among us once more! All L'Houmeau was\n  thrown into excitement yesterday by the appearance of our Lucien\n  de Rubempre. The news of his return produced a profound sensation\n  throughout the town. Angouleme certainly will not allow L'Houmeau\n  to be beforehand in doing honor to the poet who in journalism and\n  literature has so gloriously represented our town in Paris. Lucien\n  de Rubempre, a religious and Royalist poet, has braved the fury of\n  parties; he has come home, it is said, for repose after the\n  fatigue of a struggle which would try the strength of an even\n  greater intellectual athlete than a poet and a dreamer.\n\n  \"There is some talk of restoring our great poet to the title of\n  the illustrious house of de Rubempre, of which his mother, Madame\n  Chardon, is the last survivor, and it is added that Mme. la\n  Comtesse du Chatelet was the first to think of this eminently\n  politic idea. The revival of an ancient and almost extinct family\n  by young talent and newly won fame is another proof that the\n  immortal author of the Charter still cherishes the desire\n  expressed by the words 'Union and oblivion.'\n\n  \"Our poet is staying with his sister, Mme. Sechard.\"\n\n\nUnder the heading \"Angouleme\" followed some items of news:--\n\n\n  \"Our Prefect, M. le Comte du Chatelet, Gentleman in Ordinary to\n  His Majesty, has just been appointed Extraordinary Councillor of\n  State.\n\n  \"All the authorities called yesterday on M. le Prefet.\n\n  \"Mme. la Comtesse du Chatelet will receive on Thursdays.\n\n  \"The Mayor of Escarbas, M. de Negrepelisse, the representative of\n  the younger branch of the d'Espard family, and father of Mme. du\n  Chatelet, recently raised to the rank of a Count and Peer of\n  France and a Commander of the Royal Order of St. Louis, has been\n  nominated for the presidency of the electoral college of Angouleme\n  at the forthcoming elections.\"\n\n\n\"There!\" said Lucien, taking the paper to his sister. Eve read the\narticle with attention, and returned with the sheet with a thoughtful\nair.\n\n\"What do you say to that?\" asked he, surprised at a reserve that\nseemed so like indifference.\n\n\"The Cointets are proprietors of that paper, dear,\" she said; \"they\nput in exactly what they please, and it is not at all likely that the\nprefecture or the palace have forced their hands. Can you imagine that\nyour old rival the prefect would be generous enough to sing your\npraises? Have you forgotten that the Cointets are suing us under\nMetivier's name? and that they are trying to turn David's discovery to\ntheir own advantage? I do not know the source of this paragraph, but\nit makes me uneasy. You used to rouse nothing but envious feeling and\nhatred here; a prophet has no honor in his own country, and they\nslandered you, and now in a moment it is all changed----\"\n\n\"You do not know the vanity of country towns,\" said Lucien. \"A whole\nlittle town in the south turned out not so long ago to welcome a young\nman that had won the first prize in some competition; they looked on\nhim as a budding great man.\"\n\n\"Listen, dear Lucien; I do not want to preach to you, I will say\neverything in a very few words--you must suspect every little thing\nhere.\"\n\n\"You are right,\" said Lucien, but he was surprised at his sister's\nlack of enthusiasm. He himself was full of delight to find his\nhumiliating and shame-stricken return to Angouleme changed into a\ntriumph in this way.\n\n\"You have no belief in the little fame that has cost so dear!\" he said\nagain after a long silence. Something like a storm had been gathering\nin his heart during the past hour. For all answer Eve gave him a look,\nand Lucien felt ashamed of his accusation.\n\nDinner was scarcely over when a messenger came from the prefecture\nwith a note addressed to M. Chardon. That note appeared to decide the\nday for the poet's vanity; the world contending against the family for\nhim had won.\n\n\n\"M. le Comte Sixte du Chatelet and Mme. la Comtesse du Chatelet\nrequest the honor of M. Lucien Chardon's company at dinner on the\nfifteenth of September. R. S. V. P.\"\n\n\nEnclosed with the invitation there was a card--\n\n\n                     LE COMTE SIXTE DU CHATELET,\n        Gentleman of the Bedchamber, Prefect of the Charente,\n                         Councillor of State.\n\n\n\"You are in favor,\" said old Sechard; \"they are talking about you in\nthe town as if you were somebody! Angouleme and L'Houmeau are\ndisputing as to which shall twist wreaths for you.\"\n\n\"Eve, dear,\" Lucien whispered to his sister, \"I am exactly in the same\ncondition as I was before in L'Houmeau when Mme. de Bargeton sent me\nthe first invitation--I have not a dress suit for the prefect's\ndinner-party.\"\n\n\"Do you really mean to accept the invitation?\" Eve asked in alarm, and\na dispute sprang up between the brother and sister. Eve's provincial\ngood sense told her that if you appear in society, it must be with a\nsmiling face and faultless costume. \"What will come of the prefect's\ndinner?\" she wondered. \"What has Lucien to do with the great people of\nAngouleme? Are they plotting something against him?\" but she kept\nthese thoughts to herself.\n\nLucien spoke the last word at bedtime: \"You do not know my influence.\nThe prefect's wife stands in fear of a journalist; and besides, Louise\nde Negrepelisse lives on in the Comtesse du Chatelet, and a woman with\nher influence can rescue David. I am going to tell her about my\nbrother's invention, and it would be a mere nothing to her to obtain a\nsubsidy of ten thousand francs from the Government for him.\"\n\nAt eleven o'clock that night the whole household was awakened by the\ntown band, reinforced by the military band from the barracks. The\nPlace du Murier was full of people. The young men of Angouleme were\ngiving Lucien Chardon de Rubempre a serenade. Lucien went to his\nsister's window and made a speech after the last performance.\n\n\"I thank my fellow-townsmen for the honor that they do me,\" he said in\nthe midst of a great silence; \"I will strive to be worthy of it; they\nwill pardon me if I say no more; I am so much moved by this incident\nthat I cannot speak.\"\n\n\"Hurrah for the writer of _The Archer of Charles IX._! . . . Hurrah for\nthe poet of the _Marguerites_! . . . Long live Lucien de Rubempre!\"\n\nAfter these three salvos, taken up by some few voices, three crowns\nand a quantity of bouquets were adroitly flung into the room through\nthe open window. Ten minutes later the Place du Murier was empty, and\nsilence prevailed in the streets.\n\n\"I would rather have ten thousand francs,\" said old Sechard, fingering\nthe bouquets and garlands with a satirical expression. \"You gave them\ndaisies, and they give you posies in return; you deal in flowers.\"\n\n\"So that is your opinion of the honors shown me by my fellow-townsmen,\nis it?\" asked Lucien. All his melancholy had left him, his face was\nradiant with good humor. \"If you knew mankind, Papa Sechard, you would\nsee that no moment in one's life comes twice. Such a triumph as this\ncan only be due to genuine enthusiasm! . . . My dear mother, my good\nsister, this wipes out many mortifications.\"\n\nLucien kissed them; for when joy overflows like a torrent flood, we\nare fain to pour it out into a friend's heart. \"When an author is\nintoxicated with success, he will hug his porter if there is nobody\nelse on hand,\" according to Bixiou.\n\n\"Why, darling, why are you crying?\" he said, looking into Eve's face.\n\"Ah! I know, you are crying for joy!\"\n\n\"Oh me!\" said her mother, shaking her head as she spoke. \"Lucien has\nforgotten everything already; not merely his own troubles, but ours as\nwell.\"\n\nMother and daughter separated, and neither dared to utter all her\nthoughts.\n\nIn a country eaten up with the kind of social insubordination\ndisguised by the word Equality, a triumph of any kind whatsoever is a\nsort of miracle which requires, like some other miracles for that\nmatter, the co-operation of skilled labor. Out of ten ovations offered\nto ten living men, selected for this distinction by a grateful\ncountry, you may be quite sure that nine are given from considerations\nconnected as remotely as possible with the conspicuous merits of the\nrenowned recipient. What was Voltaire's apotheosis at the\nTheatre-Francais but the triumph of eighteenth century philosophy? A\ntriumph in France means that everybody else feels that he is adorning\nhis own temples with the crown that he sets on the idol's head.\n\nThe women's presentiments proved correct. The distinguished\nprovincial's reception was antipathetic to Angoumoisin immobility; it\nwas too evidently got up by some interested persons or by enthusiastic\nstage mechanics, a suspicious combination. Eve, moreover, like most of\nher sex, was distrustful by instinct, even when reason failed to\njustify her suspicions to herself. \"Who can be so fond of Lucien that\nhe could rouse the town for him?\" she wondered as she fell asleep.\n\"The _Marguerites_ are not published yet; how can they compliment him on\na future success?\"\n\nThe ovation was, in fact, the work of Petit-Claud.\n\nPetit-Claud had dined with Mme. de Senonches, for the first time, on\nthe evening of the day that brought the cure of Marsac to Angouleme\nwith the news of Lucien's return. That same evening he made formal\napplication for the hand of Mlle. de la Haye. It was a family dinner,\none of the solemn occasions marked not so much by the number of the\nguests as by the splendor of their toilettes. Consciousness of the\nperformance weighs upon the family party, and every countenance looks\nsignificant. Francoise was on exhibition. Mme. de Senonches had\nsported her most elaborate costume for the occasion; M. du Hautoy wore\na black coat; M. de Senonches had returned from his visit to the\nPimentels on the receipt of a note from his wife, informing him that\nMme. du Chatelet was to appear at their house for the first time since\nher arrival, and that a suitor in form for Francoise would appear on\nthe scenes. Boniface Cointet also was there, in his best maroon coat\nof clerical cut, with a diamond pin worth six thousand francs\ndisplayed in his shirt frill--the revenge of the rich merchant upon a\npoverty-stricken aristocracy.\n\nPetit-Claud himself, scoured and combed, had carefully removed his\ngray hairs, but he could not rid himself of his wizened air. The puny\nlittle man of law, tightly buttoned into his clothes, reminded you of\na torpid viper; for if hope had brought a spark of life into his\nmagpie eyes, his face was icily rigid, and so well did he assume an\nair of gravity, that an ambitious public prosecutor could not have\nbeen more dignified.\n\nMme. de Senonches had told her intimate friends that her ward would\nmeet her betrothed that evening, and that Mme. du Chatelet would\nappear at the Hotel de Senonches for the first time; and having\nparticularly requested them to keep these matters secret, she expected\nto find her rooms crowded. The Comte and Comtesse du Chatelet had left\ncards everywhere officially, but they meant the honor of a personal\nvisit to play a part in their policy. So aristocratic Angouleme was in\nsuch a prodigious ferment of curiosity, that certain of the Chandour\ncamp proposed to go to the Hotel de Bargeton that evening. (They\npersistently declined to call the house by its new name.)\n\nProofs of the Countess' influence had stirred up ambition in many\nquarters; and not only so, it was said that the lady had changed so\nmuch for the better that everybody wished to see and judge for\nhimself. Petit-Claud learned great news on the way to the house;\nCointet told him that Zephirine had asked leave to present her dear\nFrancoise's betrothed to the Countess, and that the Countess had\ngranted the favor. Petit-Claud had seen at once that Lucien's return\nput Louise de Negrepelisse in a false position; and now, in a moment,\nhe flattered himself that he saw a way to take advantage of it.\n\nM. and Mme. de Senonches had undertaken such heavy engagements when\nthey bought the house, that, in provincial fashion, they thought it\nimprudent to make any changes in it. So when Madame du Chatelet was\nannounced, Zephirine went up to her with--\"Look, dear Louise, you are\nstill in your old home!\" indicating, as she spoke, the little\nchandelier, the paneled wainscot, and the furniture, which once had\ndazzled Lucien.\n\n\"I wish least of all to remember it, dear,\" Madame la Prefete answered\ngraciously, looking round on the assemblage.\n\nEvery one admitted that Louise de Negrepelisse was not like the same\nwoman. If the provincial had undergone a change, the woman herself had\nbeen transformed by those eighteen months in Paris, by the first\nhappiness of a still recent second marriage, and the kind of dignity\nthat power confers. The Comtesse du Chatelet bore the same resemblance\nto Mme. de Bargeton that a girl of twenty bears to her mother.\n\nShe wore a charming cap of lace and flowers, fastened by a\ndiamond-headed pin; the ringlets that half hid the contours of her face\nadded to her look of youth, and suited her style of beauty. Her foulard\ngown, designed by the celebrated Victorine, with a pointed bodice,\nexquisitely fringed, set off her figure to advantage; and a silken\nlace scarf, adroitly thrown about a too long neck, partly concealed\nher shoulders. She played with the dainty scent-bottle, hung by a\nchain from her bracelet; she carried her fan and her handkerchief with\nease--pretty trifles, as dangerous as a sunken reef for the provincial\ndame. The refined taste shown in the least details, the carriage and\nmanner modeled upon Mme. d'Espard, revealed a profound study of the\nFaubourg Saint-Germain.\n\nAs for the elderly beau of the Empire, he seemed since his marriage to\nhave followed the example of the species of melon that turns from\ngreen to yellow in a night. All the youth that Sixte had lost seemed\nto appear in his wife's radiant countenance; provincial pleasantries\npassed from ear to ear, circulating the more readily because the women\nwere furious at the new superiority of the sometime queen of\nAngouleme; and the persistent intruder paid the penalty of his wife's\noffence.\n\nThe rooms were almost as full as on that memorable evening of Lucien's\nreadings from Chenier. Some faces were missing: M. de Chandour and\nAmelie, M. de Pimental and the Rastignacs--and M. de Bargeton was no\nlonger there; but the Bishop came, as before, with his vicars-general\nin his train. Petit-Claud was much impressed by the sight of the great\nworld of Angouleme. Four months ago he had no hope of entering the\ncircle, to-day he felt his detestation of \"the classes\" sensibly\ndiminished. He thought the Comtesse du Chatelet a most fascinating\nwoman. \"It is she who can procure me the appointment of deputy public\nprosecutor,\" he said to himself.\n\nLouise chatted for an equal length of time with each of the women; her\ntone varied with the importance of the person addressed and the\nposition taken up by the latter with regard to her journey to Paris\nwith Lucien. The evening was half over when she withdrew to the\nboudoir with the Bishop. Zephirine came over to Petit-Claud, and laid\nher hand on his arm. His heart beat fast as his hostess brought him to\nthe room where Lucien's troubles first began, and were now about to\ncome to a crisis.\n\n\"This is M. Petit-Claud, dear; I recommend him to you the more warmly\nbecause anything that you may do for him will doubtless benefit my\nward.\"\n\n\"You are an attorney, are you not, monsieur?\" said the august\nNegrepelisse, scanning Petit-Claud.\n\n\"Alas! yes, _Madame la Comtesse_.\" (The son of the tailor in L'Houmeau\nhad never once had occasion to use those three words in his life\nbefore, and his mouth was full of them.) \"But it rests with you,\nMadame la Comtesse, whether or no I shall act for the Crown. M. Milaud\nis going to Nevers, it is said----\"\n\n\"But a man is usually second deputy and then first deputy, is he not?\"\nbroke in the Countess. \"I should like to see you in the first deputy's\nplace at once. But I should like first to have some assurance of your\ndevotion to the cause of our legitimate sovereigns, to religion, and\nmore especially to M. de Villele, if I am to interest myself on your\nbehalf to obtain the favor.\"\n\nPetit-Claud came nearer. \"Madame,\" he said in her ear, \"I am the man\nto yield the King absolute obedience.\"\n\n\"That is just what _we_ want to-day,\" said the Countess, drawing back a\nlittle to make him understand that she had no wish for promises given\nunder his breath. \"So long as you satisfy Mme. de Senonches, you can\ncount upon me,\" she added, with a royal movement of her fan.\n\nPetit-Claud looked toward the door of the boudoir, and saw Cointet\nstanding there. \"Madame,\" he said, \"Lucien is here, in Angouleme.\"\n\n\"Well, sir?\" asked the Countess, in tones that would have put an end\nto all power of speech in an ordinary man.\n\n\"Mme. la Comtesse does not understand,\" returned Petit-Claud, bringing\nout that most respectful formula again. \"How does Mme. la Comtesse\nwish that the great man of her making should be received in Angouleme?\nThere is no middle course; he must be received or despised here.\"\n\nThis was a dilemma to which Louise de Negrepelisse had never given a\nthought; it touched her closely, yet rather for the sake of the past\nthan of the future. And as for Petit-Claud, his plan for arresting\nDavid Sechard depended upon the lady's actual feelings towards Lucien.\nHe waited.\n\n\"M. Petit-Claud,\" said the Countess, with haughty dignity, \"you mean\nto be on the side of the Government. Learn that the first principle of\ngovernment is this--never to have been in the wrong, and that the\ninstinct of power and the sense of dignity is even stronger in women\nthan in governments.\"\n\n\"That is just what I thought, madame,\" he answered quickly, observing\nthe Countess meanwhile with attention the more profound because it was\nscarcely visible. \"Lucien came here in the depths of misery. But if he\nmust receive an ovation, I can compel him to leave Angouleme by the\nmeans of the ovation itself. His sister and brother-in-law, David\nSechard, are hard pressed for debts.\"\n\nIn the Countess' haughty face there was a swift, barely perceptible\nchange; it was not satisfaction, but the repression of satisfaction.\nSurprised that Petit-Claud should have guessed her wishes, she gave\nhim a glance as she opened her fan, and Francoise de la Haye's\nentrance at that moment gave her time to find an answer.\n\n\"It will not be long before you are public prosecutor, monsieur,\" she\nsaid, with a significant smile. That speech did not commit her in any\nway, but it was explicit enough. Francoise had come in to thank the\nCountess.\n\n\"Oh! madame, then I shall owe the happiness of my life to you,\" she\nexclaimed, bending girlishly to add in the Countess' ear, \"To marry a\npetty provincial attorney would be like being burned by slow fires.\"\n\nIt was Francis, with his knowledge of officialdom, who had prompted\nZephirine to make this set upon Louise.\n\n\"In the very earliest days after promotion,\" so the ex-consul-general\ntold his fair friend, \"everybody, prefect, or monarch, or man of\nbusiness, is burning to exert his influence for his friends; but a\npatron soon finds out the inconveniences of patronage, and then turns\nfrom fire to ice. Louise will do more now for Petit-Claud than she\nwould do for her husband in three months' time.\"\n\n\"Madame la Comtesse is thinking of all that our poet's triumph\nentails?\" continued Petit-Claud. \"She should receive Lucien before\nthere is an end of the nine-days' wonder.\"\n\nThe Countess terminated the audience with a bow, and rose to speak\nwith Mme. de Pimentel, who came to the boudoir. The news of old\nNegrepelisse's elevation to a marquisate had greatly impressed the\nMarquise; she judged it expedient to be amiable to a woman so clever\nas to rise the higher for an apparent fall.\n\n\"Do tell me, dear, why you took the trouble to put your father in the\nHouse of Peers?\" said the Marquise, in the course of a little\nconfidential conversation, in which she bent the knee before the\nsuperiority of \"her dear Louise.\"\n\n\"They were all the more ready to grant the favor because my father has\nno son to succeed him, dear, and his vote will always be at the\ndisposal of the Crown; but if we should have sons, I quite expect that\nmy oldest will succeed to his grandfather's name, title, and peerage.\"\n\nMme. de Pimentel saw, to her annoyance, that it was idle to expect a\nmother ambitious for children not yet in existence to further her own\nprivate designs of raising M. de Pimentel to a peerage.\n\n\"I have the Countess,\" Petit-Claud told Cointet when they came away.\n\"I can promise you your partnership. I shall be deputy prosecutor\nbefore the month is out, and Sechard will be in your power. Try to\nfind a buyer for my connection; it has come to be the first in\nAngouleme in my hands during the last five months----\"\n\n\"Once put _you_ on the horse, and there is no need to do more,\" said\nCointet, half jealous of his own work.\n\nThe causes of Lucien's triumphant reception in his native town must\nnow be plain to everybody. Louise du Chatelet followed the example of\nthat King of France who left the Duke of Orleans unavenged; she chose\nto forget the insults received in Paris by Mme. de Bargeton. She would\npatronize Lucien, and overwhelming him with her patronage, would\ncompletely crush him and get rid of him by fair means. Petit-Claud\nknew the whole tale of the cabals in Paris through town gossip, and\nshrewdly guessed how a woman must hate the man who would not love when\nshe was fain of his love.\n\nThe ovation justified the past of Louise de Negrepelisse. The next day\nPetit-Claud appeared at Mme. Sechard's house, heading a deputation of\nsix young men of the town, all of them Lucien's schoolfellows. He\nmeant to finish his work, to intoxicate Lucien completely, and to have\nhim in his power. Lucien's old schoolfellows at the Angouleme\ngrammar-school wished to invite the author of the _Marguerites_ and\n_The Archer of Charles IX._ to a banquet given in honor of the great\nman arisen from their ranks.\n\n\"Come, this is your doing, Petit-Claud!\" exclaimed Lucien.\n\n\"Your return has stirred our conceit,\" said Petit-Claud; \"we made it a\npoint of honor to get up a subscription, and we will have a tremendous\naffair for you. The masters and the headmaster will be there, and, at\nthe present rate, we shall, no doubt, have the authorities too.\"\n\n\"For what day?\" asked Lucien.\n\n\"Sunday next.\"\n\n\"That is quite out of the question,\" said Lucien. \"I cannot accept an\ninvitation for the next ten days, but then I will gladly----\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said Petit-Claud, \"so be it then, in ten days' time.\"\n\nLucien behaved charmingly to his old schoolfellows, and they regarded\nhim with almost respectful admiration. He talked away very wittily for\nhalf an hour; he had been set upon a pedestal, and wished to justify\nthe opinion of his fellow-townsmen; so he stood with his hands thrust\ninto his pockets, and held forth from the height to which he had been\nraised. He was modest and good-natured, as befitted genius in\ndressing-gown and slippers; he was the athlete, wearied by a wrestling\nbout with Paris, and disenchanted above all things; he congratulated\nthe comrades who had never left the dear old province, and so forth,\nand so forth. They were delighted with him. He took Petit-Claud aside,\nand asked him for the real truth about David's affairs, reproaching\nhim for allowing his brother-in-law to go into hiding, and tried to\nmatch his wits against the little lawyer. Petit-Claud made an effort\nover himself, and gave his acquaintance to understand that he\n(Petit-Claud) was only an insignificant little country attorney, with\nno sort of craft nor subtlety.\n\nThe whole machinery of modern society is so infinitely more complex\nthan in ancient times, that the subdivision of human faculty is the\nresult. The great men of the days of old were perforce universal\ngeniuses, appearing at rare intervals like lighted torches in an\nantique world. In the course of ages the intellect began to work on\nspecial lines, but the great man still could \"take all knowledge for\nhis province.\" A man \"full cautelous,\" as was said of Louis XI., for\ninstance, could apply that special faculty in every direction, but\nto-day the single quality is subdivided, and every profession has its\nspecial craft. A peasant or a pettifogging solicitor might very easily\noverreach an astute diplomate over a bargain in some remote country\nvillage; and the wiliest journalist may prove the veriest simpleton in\na piece of business. Lucien could but be a puppet in the hands of\nPetit-Claud.\n\nThat guileful practitioner, as might have been expected, had written\nthe article himself; Angouleme and L'Houmeau, thus put on their\nmettle, thought it incumbent upon them to pay honor to Lucien. His\nfellow-citizens, assembled in the Place du Murier, were Cointets'\nworkpeople from the papermills and printing-house, with a sprinkling\nof Lucien's old schoolfellows and the clerks in the employ of\nMessieurs Petit-Claud and Cachan. As for the attorney himself, he was\nonce more Lucien's chum of old days; and he thought, not without\nreason, that before very long he should learn David's whereabouts in\nsome unguarded moment. And if David came to grief through Lucien's\nfault, the poet would find Angouleme too hot to hold him. Petit-Claud\nmeant to secure his hold; he posed, therefore, as Lucien's inferior.\n\n\"What better could I have done?\" he said accordingly. \"My old chum's\nsister was involved, it is true, but there are some positions that\nsimply cannot be maintained in a court of law. David asked me on the\nfirst of June to ensure him a quiet life for three months; he had a\nquiet life until September, and even so I have kept his property out\nof his creditors' power, for I shall gain my case in the Court-Royal;\nI contend that the wife is a privileged creditor, and her claim is\nabsolute, unless there is evidence of intent to defraud. As for you,\nyou have come back in misfortune, but you are a genius.\"--(Lucien\nturned about as if the incense were burned too close to his face.)\n--\"Yes, my dear fellow, a _genius_. I have read your _Archer of\nCharles IX._; it is more than a romance, it is literature. Only two\nliving men could have written the preface--Chateaubriand and Lucien.\"\n\nLucien accepted that d'Arthez had written the preface. Ninety-nine\nwriters out of a hundred would have done the same.\n\n\"Well, nobody here seemed to have heard of you!\" Petit-Claud\ncontinued, with apparent indignation. \"When I saw the general\nindifference, I made up my mind to change all that. I wrote that\narticle in the paper----\"\n\n\"What? did you write it?\" exclaimed Lucien.\n\n\"I myself. Angouleme and L'Houmeau were stirred to rivalry; I arranged\nfor a meeting of your old schoolfellows, and got up yesterday's\nserenade; and when once the enthusiasm began to grow, we started a\ncommittee for the dinner. 'If David is in hiding,' said I to myself,\n'Lucien shall be crowned at any rate.' And I have done even better\nthan that,\" continued Petit-Claud; \"I have seen the Comtesse du\nChatelet and made her understand that she owes it to herself to\nextricate David from his position; she can do it, and she ought to do\nit. If David had really discovered the secret of which he spoke to me,\nthe Government ought to lend him a hand, it would not ruin the\nGovernment; and think what a fine thing for a prefect to have half the\ncredit of the great invention for the well-timed help. It would set\npeople talking about him as an enlightened administrator.--Your sister\nhas taken fright at our musketry practice; she was scared of the\nsmoke. A battle in the law-courts costs quite as much as a battle on\nthe field; but David has held his ground, he has his secret. They\ncannot stop him, and they will not pull him up now.\"\n\n\"Thanks, my dear fellow; I see that I can take you into my confidence;\nyou shall help me to carry out my plan.\"\n\nPetit-Claud looked at Lucien, and his gimlet face was a point of\ninterrogation.\n\n\"I intend to rescue Sechard,\" Lucien said, with a certain importance.\n\"I brought his misfortunes upon him; I mean to make full\nreparation. . . . I have more influence over Louise----\"\n\n\"Who is Louise?\"\n\n\"The Comtesse du Chatelet!\"\n\nPetit-Claud started.\n\n\"I have more influence over her than she herself suspects,\" said\nLucien; \"only, my dear fellow, if I can do something with your\nauthorities here, I have no decent clothes.\"--Petit-Claud made as\nthough he would offer his purse.\n\n\"Thank you,\" said Lucien, grasping Petit-Claud's hand. \"In ten days'\ntime I will pay a visit to the Countess and return your call.\"\n\nThe shook hands like old comrades, and separated.\n\n\"He ought to be a poet\" said Petit-Claud to himself; \"he is quite\nmad.\"\n\n\"There are no friends like one's school friends; it is a true saying,\"\nLucien thought at he went to find his sister.\n\n\"What can Petit-Claud have promised to do that you should be so\nfriendly with him, my Lucien?\" asked Eve. \"Be on your guard with him.\"\n\n\"With _him_?\" cried Lucien. \"Listen, Eve,\" he continued, seeming to\nbethink himself; \"you have no faith in me now; you do not trust me, so\nit is not likely you will trust Petit-Claud; but in ten or twelve days\nyou will change your mind,\" he added, with a touch of fatuity. And he\nwent to his room, and indited the following epistle to Lousteau:--\n\n\n               _Lucien to Lousteau._\n\n  \"MY FRIEND,--Of the pair of us, I alone can remember that bill for\n  a thousand francs that I once lent you; and I know how things will\n  be with you when you open this letter too well, alas! not to add\n  immediately that I do not expect to be repaid in current coin of\n  the realm; no, I will take it in credit from you, just as one\n  would ask Florine for pleasure. We have the same tailor;\n  therefore, you can order a complete outfit for me on the shortest\n  possible notice. I am not precisely wearing Adam's costume, but I\n  cannot show myself here. To my astonishment, the honors paid by\n  the departments to a Parisian celebrity awaited me. I am the hero\n  of a banquet, for all the world as if I were a Deputy of the Left.\n  Now, after that, do you understand that I must have a black coat?\n  Promise to pay; have it put down to your account, try the\n  advertisement dodge, rehearse an unpublished scene between Don\n  Juan and M. Dimanche, for I must have a gala suit at all costs. I\n  have nothing, nothing but rags: start with that; it is August, the\n  weather is magnificent, ergo see that I receive by the end of the\n  week a charming morning suit, dark bronze-green jacket, and three\n  waistcoats, one a brimstone yellow, one a plaid, and the third\n  must be white; furthermore, let there be three pairs of trousers\n  of the most fetching kind--one pair of white English stuff, one\n  pair of nankeen, and a third of thin black kerseymere; lastly,\n  send a black dress-coat and a black satin waistcoat. If you have\n  picked up another Florine somewhere, I beg her good offices for\n  two cravats. So far this is nothing; I count upon you and your\n  skill in these matters; I am not much afraid of the tailor. But\n  the ingenuity of poverty, assuredly the most active of all poisons\n  at work in the system of man (_id est_ the Parisian), an ingenuity\n  that would catch Satan himself napping, has failed so far to\n  discover a way to obtain a hat on credit!--How many a time, my\n  dear friend, have we deplored this! When one of us shall bring a\n  hat that costs one thousand francs into fashion, then, and not\n  till then, can we afford to wear them; until that day comes we are\n  bound to have cash enough in our pockets to pay for a hat. Ah!\n  what an ill turn the Comedie-Francaise did us with, 'Lafleur, you\n  will put gold in my pockets!'\n\n  \"I write with a profound sense of all the difficulties involved by\n  the demand. Enclose with the above a pair of boots, a pair of\n  pumps, a hat, half a dozen pairs of gloves. 'Tis asking the\n  impossible; I know it. But what is a literary life but a\n  periodical recurrence of the impossible? Work the miracle, write a\n  long article, or play some small scurvy trick, and I will hold\n  your debt as fully discharged--this is all I say to you. It is a\n  debt of honor after all, my dear fellow, and due these twelve\n  months; you ought to blush for yourself if you have any blushes\n  left.\n\n  \"Joking apart, my dear Lousteau, I am in serious difficulties, as\n  you may judge for yourself when I tell you that Mme. de Bargeton\n  has married Chatelet, and Chatelet is prefect of Angouleme. The\n  precious pair can do a good deal for my brother-in-law; he is in\n  hiding at this moment on account of that letter of exchange, and\n  the horrid business is all my doing. So it is a question of\n  appearing before Mme. la Prefete and regaining my influence at all\n  costs. It is shocking, is it not, that David Sechard's fate should\n  hang upon a neat pair of shoes, a pair of open-worked gray silk\n  stockings (mind you, remember them), and a new hat? I shall give\n  out that I am sick and ill, and take to my bed, like Duvicquet, to\n  save the trouble of replying to the pressing invitations of my\n  fellow-townsmen. My fellow-townsmen, dear boy, have treated me to\n  a fine serenade. _My fellow-townsmen_, forsooth! I begin to wonder\n  how many fools go to make up that word, since I learned that two\n  or three of my old schoolfellows worked up the capital of the\n  Angoumois to this pitch of enthusiasm.\n\n  \"If you could contrive to slip a few lines as to my reception in\n  among the news items, I should be several inches taller for it\n  here; and besides, I should make Mme. la Prefete feel that, if I\n  have not friends, I have some credit, at any rate, with the\n  Parisian press. I give up none of my hopes, and I will return the\n  compliment. If you want a good, solid, substantial article for\n  some magazine or other, I have time enough now to think something\n  out. I only say the word, my dear friend; I count upon you as you\n  may count upon me, and I am yours sincerely.\n\n                                                      \"LUCIEN DE R.\n\n  \"P. S.--Send the things to the coach office to wait until called\n  for.\"\n\n\nLucien held up his head again. In this mood he wrote the letter, and\nas he wrote his thoughts went back to Paris. He had spent six days in\nthe provinces, and the uneventful quietness of provincial life had\nalready entered into his soul; his mind returned to those dear old\nmiserable days with a vague sense of regret. The Comtesse du Chatelet\nfilled his thoughts for a whole week; and at last he came to attach so\nmuch importance to his reappearance, that he hurried down to the coach\noffice in L'Houmeau after nightfall in a perfect agony of suspense,\nlike a woman who has set her last hopes upon a new dress, and waits in\ndespair until it arrives.\n\n\"Ah! Lousteau, all your treasons are forgiven,\" he said to himself, as\nhe eyed the packages, and knew from the shape of them that everything\nhad been sent. Inside the hatbox he found a note from Lousteau:--\n\n\n                                             FLORINE'S DRAWING-ROOM.\n\n  \"MY DEAR BOY,--The tailor behaved very well; but as thy profound\n  retrospective glance led thee to forbode, the cravats, the hats,\n  and the silk hosen perplexed our souls, for there was nothing in\n  our purse to be perplexed thereby. As said Blondet, so say we;\n  there is a fortune awaiting the establishment which will supply\n  young men with inexpensive articles on credit; for when we do not\n  pay in the beginning, we pay dear in the end. And by the by, did\n  not the great Napoleon, who missed a voyage to the Indies for want\n  of boots, say that, 'If a thing is easy, it is never done?' So\n  everything went well--except the boots. I beheld a vision of thee,\n  fully dressed, but without a hat! appareled in waistcoats, yet\n  shoeless! and bethought me of sending a pair of moccasins given to\n  Florine as a curiosity by an American. Florine offered the huge\n  sum of forty francs, that we might try our luck at play for you.\n  Nathan, Blondet, and I had such luck (as we were not playing for\n  ourselves) that we were rich enough to ask La Torpille, des\n  Lupeaulx's sometime 'rat,' to supper. Frascati certainly owed us\n  that much. Florine undertook the shopping, and added three fine\n  shirts to the purchases. Nathan sends you a cane. Blondet, who won\n  three hundred francs, is sending you a gold chain; and the gold\n  watch, the size of a forty-franc piece, is from La Torpille; some\n  idiot gave the thing to her, and it will not go. 'Trumpery\n  rubbish,' she says, 'like the man that owned it.' Bixiou, who came\n  to find us up at the _Rocher de Cancale_, wished to enclose a bottle\n  of Portugal water in the package. Said our first comic man, 'If\n  this can make him happy, let him have it!' growling it out in a\n  deep bass voice with the _bourgeois_ pomposity that he can act to\n  the life. Which things, my dear boy, ought to prove to you how\n  much we care for our friends in adversity. Florine, whom I have\n  had the weakness to forgive, begs you to send us an article on\n  Nathan's hat. Fare thee well, my son. I can only commiserate you\n  on finding yourself back in the same box from which you emerged\n  when you discovered your old comrade.\n\n                                                        \"ETIENNE L.\"\n\n\n\"Poor fellows! They have been gambling for me,\" said Lucien; he was\nquite touched by the letter. A waft of the breeze from an unhealthy\ncountry, from the land where one has suffered most, may seem to bring\nthe odors of Paradise; and in a dull life there is an indefinable\nsweetness in memories of past pain.\n\nEve was struck dumb with amazement when her brother came down in his\nnew clothes. She did not recognize him.\n\n\"Now I can walk out in Beaulieu,\" he cried; \"they shall not say it of\nme that I came back in rags. Look, here is a watch which I shall\nreturn to you, for it is mine; and, like its owner, it is erratic in\nits ways.\"\n\n\"What a child he is!\" exclaimed Eve. \"It is impossible to bear you any\ngrudge.\"\n\n\"Then do you imagine, my dear girl, that I sent for all this with the\nsilly idea of shining in Angouleme? I don't care _that_ for Angouleme\"\n(twirling his cane with the engraved gold knob). \"I intend to repair\nthe wrong I have done, and this is my battle array.\"\n\nLucien's success in this kind was his one real triumph; but the\ntriumph, be it said, was immense. If admiration freezes some people's\ntongues, envy loosens at least as many more, and if women lost their\nheads over Lucien, men slandered him. He might have cried, in the\nwords of the songwriter, \"I thank thee, my coat!\" He left two cards at\nthe prefecture, and another upon Petit-Claud. The next day, the day of\nthe banquet, the following paragraph appeared under the heading\n\"Angouleme\" in the Paris newspapers:--\n\n\n                             \"ANGOULEME.\n\n  \"The return of the author of _The Archer of Charles IX._ has been\n  the signal for an ovation which does equal honor to the town and\n  to M. Lucien de Rubempre, the young poet who has made so brilliant\n  a beginning; the writer of the one French historical novel not\n  written in the style of Scott, and of a preface which may be\n  called a literary event. The town hastened to offer him a\n  patriotic banquet on his return. The name of the\n  recently-appointed prefect is associated with the public\n  demonstration in honor of the author of the _Marguerites_, whose\n  talent received such warm encouragement from Mme. du Chatelet at\n  the outset of his career.\"\n\n\nIn France, when once the impulse is given, nobody can stop. The\ncolonel of the regiment offered to put his band at the disposal of the\ncommittee. The landlord of the _Bell_ (renowned for truffled turkeys,\ndespatched in the most wonderful porcelain jars to the uttermost parts\nof the earth), the famous innkeeper of L'Houmeau, would supply the\nrepast. At five o'clock some forty persons, all in state and festival\narray, were assembled in his largest ball, decorated with hangings,\ncrowns of laurel, and bouquets. The effect was superb. A crowd of\nonlookers, some hundred persons, attracted for the most part by the\nmilitary band in the yard, represented the citizens of Angouleme.\n\nPetit-Claud went to the window. \"All Angouleme is here,\" he said,\nlooking out.\n\n\"I can make nothing of this,\" remarked little Postel to his wife (they\nhad come out to hear the band play). \"Why, the prefect and the\nreceiver-general, and the colonel and the superintendent of the powder\nfactory, and our mayor and deputy, and the headmaster of the school,\nand the manager of the foundry at Ruelle, and the public prosecutor,\nM. Milaud, and all the authorities, have just gone in!\"\n\nThe bank struck up as they sat down to table with variations on the\nair _Vive le roy, vive la France_, a melody which has never found\npopular favor. It was then five o'clock in the evening; it was eight\no'clock before dessert was served. Conspicuous among the sixty-five\ndishes appeared an Olympus in confectionery, surmounted by a figure of\nFrance modeled in chocolate, to give the signal for toasts and\nspeeches.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" called the prefect, rising to his feet, \"the King! the\nrightful ruler of France! To what do we owe the generation of poets\nand thinkers who maintain the sceptre of letters in the hands of\nFrance, if not to the peace which the Bourbons have restored----\"\n\n\"Long live the King!\" cried the assembled guests (ministerialists\npredominated).\n\nThe venerable headmaster rose.\n\n\"To the hero of the day,\" he said, \"to the young poet who combines the\ngift of the _prosateur_ with the charm and poetic faculty of Petrarch in\nthat sonnet-form which Boileau declares to be so difficult.\"\n\nCheers.\n\nThe colonel rose next. \"Gentlemen, to the Royalist! for the hero of\nthis evening had the courage to fight for sound principles!\"\n\n\"Bravo!\" cried the prefect, leading the applause.\n\nThen Petit-Claud called upon all Lucien's schoolfellows there present.\n\"To the pride of the grammar-school of Angouleme! to the venerable\nheadmaster so dear to us all, to whom the acknowledgment for some part\nof our triumph is due!\"\n\nThe old headmaster dried his eyes; he had not expected this toast.\nLucien rose to his feet, the whole room was suddenly silent, and the\npoet's face grew white. In that pause the old headmaster, who sat on\nhis left, crowned him with a laurel wreath. A round of applause\nfollowed, and when Lucien spoke it was with tears in his eyes and a\nsob in his throat.\n\n\"He is drunk,\" remarked the attorney-general-designate to his\nneighbor, Petit-Claud.\n\n\"My dear fellow-countrymen, my dear comrades,\" Lucien said at last, \"I\ncould wish that all France might witness this scene; for thus men rise\nto their full stature, and in such ways as these our land demands\ngreat deeds and noble work of us. And when I think of the little that\nI have done, and of this great honor shown to me to-day, I can only\nfeel confused and impose upon the future the task of justifying your\nreception of me. The recollection of this moment will give me renewed\nstrength for efforts to come. Permit me to indicate for your homage my\nearliest muse and protectress, and to associate her name with that of\nmy birthplace; so--to the Comtesse du Chatelet and the noble town of\nAngouleme!\"\n\n\"He came out of that pretty well!\" said the public prosecutor, nodding\napproval; \"our speeches were all prepared, and his was improvised.\"\n\nAt ten o'clock the party began to break up, and little knots of guests\nwent home together. David Sechard heard the unwonted music.\n\n\"What is going on in L'Houmeau?\" he asked of Basine.\n\n\"They are giving a dinner to your brother-in-law, Lucien----\"\n\n\"I know that he would feel sorry to miss me there,\" he said.\n\nAt midnight Petit-Claud walked home with Lucien. As they reached the\nPlace du Murier, Lucien said, \"Come life, come death, we are friends,\nmy dear fellow.\"\n\n\"My marriage contract,\" said the lawyer, \"with Mlle. Francoise de la\nHaye will be signed to-morrow at Mme. de Senonches' house; do me the\npleasure of coming. Mme. de Senonches implored me to bring you, and\nyou will meet Mme. du Chatelet; they are sure to tell her of your\nspeech, and she will feel flattered by it.\"\n\n\"I knew what I was about,\" said Lucien.\n\n\"Oh! you will save David.\"\n\n\"I am sure I shall,\" the poet replied.\n\nJust at that moment David appeared as if by magic in the Place du\nMurier. This was how it had come about. He felt that he was in a\nrather difficult position; his wife insisted that Lucien must neither\ngo to David nor know of his hiding-place; and Lucien all the while was\nwriting the most affectionate letters, saying that in a few days' time\nall should be set right; and even as Basine Clerget explained the\nreason why the band played, she put two letters into his hands. The\nfirst was from Eve.\n\n\n  \"DEAREST,\" she wrote, \"do as if Lucien were not here; do not\n  trouble yourself in the least; our whole security depends upon the\n  fact that your enemies cannot find you; get that idea firmly into\n  your head. I have more confidence in Kolb and Marion and Basine\n  than in my own brother; such is my misfortune. Alas! poor Lucien\n  is not the ingenuous and tender-hearted poet whom we used to know;\n  and it is simply because he is trying to interfere on your behalf,\n  and because he imagines that he can discharge our debts (and this\n  from pride, my David), that I am afraid of him. Some fine clothes\n  have been sent from Paris for him, and five gold pieces in a\n  pretty purse. He gave the money to me, and we are living on it.\n\n  \"We have one enemy the less. Your father has gone, thanks to\n  Petit-Claud. Petit-Claud unraveled his designs, and put an end to\n  them at once by telling him that you would do nothing without\n  consulting him, and that he (Petit-Claud) would not allow you to\n  concede a single point in the matter of the invention until you\n  had been promised an indemnity of thirty thousand francs; fifteen\n  thousand to free you from embarrassment, and fifteen thousand more\n  to be yours in any case, whether your invention succeeds or no. I\n  cannot understand Petit-Claud. I embrace you, dear, a wife's kiss\n  for her husband in trouble. Our little Lucien is well. How strange\n  it is to watch him grow rosy and strong, like a flower, in these\n  stormy days! Mother prays God for you now, as always, and sends\n  love only less tender than mine.--Your\n                                                              \"EVE.\"\n\n\nAs a matter of fact, Petit-Claud and the Cointets had taken fright at\nold Sechard's peasant shrewdness, and got rid of him so much the more\neasily because it was now vintage time at Marsac. Eve's letter\nenclosed another from Lucien:--\n\n\n  \"MY DEAR DAVID,--Everything is going well. I am armed _cap-a-pie_;\n  to-day I open the campaign, and in forty-eight hours I shall have\n  made great progress. How glad I shall be to embrace you when you\n  are free again and my debts are all paid! My mother and sister\n  persist in mistrusting me; their suspicion wounds me to the quick.\n  As if I did not know already that you are hiding with Basine, for\n  every time that Basine comes to the house I hear news of you and\n  receive answers to my letters; and besides, it is plain that my\n  sister could not find any one else to trust. It hurts me cruelly\n  to think that I shall be so near you to-day, and yet that you will\n  not be present at this banquet in my honor. I owe my little\n  triumph to the vainglory of Angouleme; in a few days it will be\n  quite forgotten, and you alone would have taken a real pleasure in\n  it. But, after all, in a little while you will pardon everything\n  to one who counts it more than all the triumphs in the world to be\n  your brother,\n                                                           \"LUCIEN.\"\n\n\nTwo forces tugged sharply at David's heart; he adored his wife; and if\nhe held Lucien in somewhat less esteem, his friendship was scarcely\ndiminished. In solitude our feelings have unrestricted play; and a man\npreoccupied like David, with all-absorbing thoughts, will give way to\nimpulses for which ordinary life would have provided a sufficient\ncounterpoise. As he read Lucien's letter to the sound of military\nmusic, and heard of this unlooked-for recognition, he was deeply\ntouched by that expression of regret. He had known how it would be. A\nvery slight expression of feeling appeals irresistibly to a sensitive\nsoul, for they are apt to credit others with like depths. How should\nthe drop fall unless the cup were full to the brim?\n\nSo at midnight, in spite of all Basine's entreaties, David must go to\nsee Lucien.\n\n\"Nobody will be out in the streets at this time of night,\" he said; \"I\nshall not be seen, and they cannot arrest me. Even if I should meet\npeople, I can make use of Kolb's way of going into hiding. And\nbesides, it is so intolerably long since I saw my wife and child.\"\n\nThe reasoning was plausible enough; Basine gave way, and David went.\nPetit-Claud was just taking leave as he came up and at his cry of\n_\"Lucien!\"_ the two brothers flung their arms about each other with\ntears in their eyes.\n\nLife holds not many moments such as these. Lucien's heart went out in\nresponse to this friendship for its own sake. There was never question\nof debtor and creditor between them, and the offender met with no\nreproaches save his own. David, generous and noble that he was, was\nlonging to bestow pardon; he meant first of all to read Lucien a\nlecture, and scatter the clouds that overspread the love of the\nbrother and sister; and with these ends in view, the lack of money and\nits consequent dangers disappeared entirely from his mind.\n\n\"Go home,\" said Petit-Claud, addressing his client; \"take advantage of\nyour imprudence to see your wife and child again, at any rate; and you\nmust not be seen, mind you!--How unlucky!\" he added, when he was alone\nin the Place du Murier. \"If only Cerizet were here----\"\n\nThe buildings magniloquently styled the Angouleme Law Courts were then\nin process of construction. Petit-Claud muttered these words to\nhimself as he passed by the hoardings, and heard a tap upon the\nboards, and a voice issuing from a crack between two planks.\n\n\"Here I am,\" said Cerizet; \"I saw David coming out of L'Houmeau. I was\nbeginning to have my suspicions about his retreat, and now I am sure;\nand I know where to have him. But I want to know something of Lucien's\nplans before I set the snare for David; and here are you sending him\ninto the house! Find some excuse for stopping here, at least, and when\nDavid and Lucien come out, send them round this way; they will think\nthey are quite alone, and I shall overhear their good-bye.\"\n\n\"You are a very devil,\" muttered Petit-Claud.\n\n\"Well, I'm blessed if a man wouldn't do anything for the thing you\npromised me.\"\n\nPetit-Claud walked away from the hoarding, and paced up and down in\nthe Place du Murier; he watched the windows of the room where the\nfamily sat together, and thought of his own prospects to keep up his\ncourage. Cerizet's cleverness had given him the chance of striking the\nfinal blow. Petit-Claud was a double-dealer of the profoundly cautious\nstamp that is never caught by the bait of a present satisfaction, nor\nentangled by a personal attachment, after his first initiation into\nthe strategy of self-seeking and the instability of the human heart.\nSo, from the very first, he had put little trust in Cointet. He\nforesaw that his marriage negotiations might very easily be broken\noff, saw also that in that case he could not accuse Cointet of bad\nfaith, and he had taken his measures accordingly. But since his\nsuccess at the Hotel de Bargeton, Petit-Claud's game was above board.\nA certain under-plot of his was useless now, and even dangerous to a\nman with his political ambitions. He had laid the foundations of his\nfuture importance in the following manner:--\n\nGannerac and a few of the wealthy men of business in L'Houmeau formed\na sort of Liberal clique in constant communication (through commercial\nchannels) with the leaders of the Opposition. The Villele ministry,\naccepted by the dying Louis XVIII., gave the signal for a change of\ntactics in the Opposition camp; for, since the death of Napoleon, the\nliberals had ceased to resort to the dangerous expedient of\nconspiracy. They were busy organizing resistance by lawful means\nthroughout the provinces, and aiming at securing control of the great\nbulk of electors by convincing the masses. Petit-Claud, a rabid\nLiberal, and a man of L'Houmeau, was the instigator, the secret\ncounselor, and the very life of this movement in the lower town, which\ngroaned under the tyranny of the aristocrats at the upper end. He was\nthe first to see the danger of leaving the whole press of the\ndepartment in the control of the Cointets; the Opposition must have\nits organ; it would not do to be behind other cities.\n\n\"If each one of us gives Gannerac a bill for five hundred francs, he\nwould have some twenty thousand francs and more; we might buy up\nSechard's printing-office, and we could do as we liked with the\nmaster-printer if we lent him the capital,\" Petit-Claud had said.\n\nOthers had taken up the idea, and in this way Petit-Claud strengthened\nhis position with regard to David on the one side and the Cointets on\nthe other. Casting about him for a tool for his party, he naturally\nthought that a rogue of Cerizet's calibre was the very man for the\npurpose.\n\n\"If you can find Sechard's hiding-place and put him in our hands,\nsomebody will lend you twenty thousand francs to buy his business, and\nvery likely there will be a newspaper to print. So, set about it,\" he\nhad said.\n\nPetit-Claud put more faith in Cerizet's activity than in all the\nDoublons in existence; and then it was that he promised Cointet that\nSechard should be arrested. But now that the little lawyer cherished\nhopes of office, he saw that he must turn his back upon the Liberals;\nand, meanwhile, the amount for the printing-office had been subscribed\nin L'Houmeau. Petit-Claud decided to allow things to take their\nnatural course.\n\n\"Pooh!\" he thought, \"Cerizet will get into trouble with his paper, and\ngive me an opportunity of displaying my talents.\"\n\nHe walked up to the door of the printing-office and spoke to Kolb, the\nsentinel. \"Go up and warn David that he had better go now,\" he said,\n\"and take every precaution. I am going home; it is one o'clock.\"\n\nMarion came to take Kolb's place. Lucien and David came down together\nand went out, Kolb a hundred paces ahead of them, and Marion at the\nsame distance behind. The two friends walked past the hoarding, Lucien\ntalking eagerly the while.\n\n\"My plan is extremely simple, David; but how could I tell you about it\nwhile Eve was there? She would never understand. I am quite sure that\nat the bottom of Louise's heart there is a feeling that I can rouse,\nand I should like to arouse it if it is only to avenge myself upon\nthat idiot the prefect. If our love affair only lasts for a week, I\nwill contrive to send an application through her for the subvention of\ntwenty thousand francs for you. I am going to see her again to-morrow\nin the little boudoir where our old affair of the heart began;\nPetit-Claud says that the room is the same as ever; I shall play my\npart in the comedy; and I will send word by Basine to-morrow morning\nto tell you whether the actor was hissed. You may be at liberty by\nthen, who knows?--Now do you understand how it was that I wanted\nclothes from Paris? One cannot act the lover's part in rags.\"\n\nAt six o'clock that morning Cerizet went to Petit-Claud.\n\n\"Doublon can be ready to take his man to-morrow at noon, I will answer\nfor it,\" he said; \"I know one of Mlle. Clerget's girls, do you\nunderstand?\" Cerizet unfolded his plan, and Petit-Claud hurried to\nfind Cointet.\n\n\"If M. Francis du Hautoy will settle his property on Francoise, you\nshall sign a deed of partnership with Sechard in two days. I shall not\nbe married for a week after the contract is signed, so we shall both\nbe within the terms of our little agreement, tit for tat. To-night,\nhowever, we must keep a close watch over Lucien and Mme. la Comtesse\ndu Chatelet, for the whole business lies in that. . . . If Lucien\nhopes to succeed through the Countess' influence, I have David\nsafe----\"\n\n\"You will be Keeper of the Seals yet, it is my belief,\" said Cointet.\n\n\"And why not? No one objects to M. de Peyronnet,\" said Petit-Claud. He\nhad not altogether sloughed his skin of Liberalism.\n\nMlle. de la Haye's ambiguous position brought most of the upper town\nto the signing of the marriage contract. The comparative poverty of\nthe young couple and the absence of a _corbeille_ quickened the interest\nthat people love to exhibit; for it is with beneficence as with\novations, we prefer the deeds of charity which gratify self-love. The\nMarquise de Pimentel, the Comtesse du Chatelet, M. de Senonches, and\none or two frequenters of the house had given Francoise a few wedding\npresents, which made great talk in the city. These pretty trifles,\ntogether with the trousseau which Zephirine had been preparing for the\npast twelve months, the godfather's jewels, and the usual wedding\ngifts, consoled Francoise and roused the curiosity of some mothers of\ndaughters.\n\nPetit-Claud and Cointet had both remarked that their presence in the\nAngouleme Olympus was endured rather than courted. Cointet was\nFrancoise's trustee and quasi-guardian; and if Petit-Claud was to sign\nthe contract, Petit-Claud's presence was as necessary as the\nattendance of the man to be hanged at an execution; but though, once\nmarried, Mme. Petit-Claud might keep her right of entry to her\ngodmother's house, Petit-Claud foresaw some difficulty on his own\naccount, and resolved to be beforehand with these haughty personages.\n\nHe felt ashamed of his parents. He had sent his mother to stay at\nMansle; now he begged her to say that she was out of health and to\ngive her consent in writing. So humiliating was it to be without\nrelations, protectors, or witnesses to his signature, that Petit-Claud\nthought himself in luck that he could bring a presentable friend at\nthe Countess' request. He called to take up Lucien, and they drove to\nthe Hotel de Bargeton.\n\nOn that memorable evening the poet dressed to outshine every man\npresent. Mme. de Senonches had spoken of him as the hero of the hour,\nand a first interview between two estranged lovers is the kind of\nscene that provincials particularly love. Lucien had come to be the\nlion of the evening; he was said to be so handsome, so much changed,\nso wonderful, that every well-born woman in Angouleme was curious to\nsee him again. Following the fashion of the transition period between\nthe eighteenth century small clothes and the vulgar costume of the\npresent day, he wore tight-fitting black trousers. Men still showed\ntheir figures in those days, to the utter despair of lean,\nclumsily-made mortals; and Lucien was an Apollo. The open-work gray\nsilk stockings, the neat shoes, and the black satin waistcoat were\nscrupulously drawn over his person, and seemed to cling to him. His\nforehead looked the whiter by contrast with the thick, bright curls\nthat rose above it with studied grace. The proud eyes were radiant.\nThe hands, small as a woman's, never showed to better advantage than\nwhen gloved. He had modeled himself upon de Marsay, the famous\nParisian dandy, holding his hat and cane in one hand, and keeping the\nother free for the very occasional gestures which illustrated his\ntalk.\n\nLucien had quite intended to emulate the famous false modesty of those\nwho bend their heads to pass beneath the Porte Saint-Denis, and to\nslip unobserved into the room; but Petit-Claud, having but one friend,\nmade him useful. He brought Lucien almost pompously through a crowded\nroom to Mme. de Senonches. The poet heard a murmur as he passed; not\nso very long ago that hum of voices would have turned his head, to-day\nhe was quite different; he did not doubt that he himself was greater\nthan the whole Olympus put together.\n\n\"Madame,\" he said, addressing Mme. de Senonches, \"I have already\ncongratulated my friend Petit-Claud (a man with the stuff in him of\nwhich Keepers of the Seals are made) on the honor of his approaching\nconnection with you, slight as are the ties between godmother and\ngoddaughter----\" (this with the air of a man uttering an epigram, by\nno means lost upon any woman in the room, for every woman was\nlistening without appearing to do so.) \"And as for myself,\" he\ncontinued, \"I am delighted to have the opportunity of paying my homage\nto you.\"\n\nHe spoke easily and fluently, as some great lord might speak under the\nroof of his inferiors; and as he listened to Zephirine's involved\nreply, he cast a glance over the room to consider the effect that he\nwished to make. The pause gave him time to discover Francis du Hautoy\nand the prefect; to bow gracefully to each with the proper shade of\ndifference in his smile, and, finally, to approach Mme. du Chatelet as\nif he had just caught sight of her. That meeting was the real event of\nthe evening. No one so much as thought of the marriage contract lying\nin the adjoining bedroom, whither Francoise and the notary led guest\nafter guest to sign the document. Lucien made a step towards Louise de\nNegrepelisse, and then spoke with that grace of manner now associated,\nfor her, with memories of Paris.\n\n\"Do I owe to you, madame, the pleasure of an invitation to dine at the\nPrefecture the day after to-morrow?\" he said.\n\n\"You owe it solely to your fame, monsieur,\" Louise answered drily,\nsomewhat taken aback by the turn of a phrase by which Lucien\ndeliberately tried to wound her pride.\n\n\"Ah! Madame la Comtesse, I cannot bring you the guest if the man is in\ndisgrace,\" said Lucien, and, without waiting for an answer, he turned\nand greeted the Bishop with stately grace.\n\n\"Your lordship's prophecy has been partially fulfilled,\" he said, and\nthere was a winning charm in his tones; \"I will endeavor to fulfil it\nto the letter. I consider myself very fortunate since this evening\nbrings me an opportunity of paying my respects to you.\"\n\nLucien drew the Bishop into a conversation that lasted for ten\nminutes. The women looked on Lucien as a phenomenon. His unexpected\ninsolence had struck Mme. du Chatelet dumb; she could not find an\nanswer. Looking round the room, she saw that every woman admired\nLucien; she watched group after group repeating the phrases by which\nLucien crushed her with seeming disdain, and her heart contracted with\na spasm of mortification.\n\n\"Suppose that he should not come to the Prefecture after this, what\ntalk there would be!\" she thought. \"Where did he learn this pride? Can\nMlle. des Touches have taken a fancy for him? . . . He is so handsome.\nThey say that she hurried to see him in Paris the day after that\nactress died. . . . Perhaps he has come to the rescue of his\nbrother-in-law, and happened to be behind our caleche at Mansle by\naccident. Lucien looked at us very strangely that morning.\"\n\nA crowd of thoughts crossed Louise's brain, and unluckily for her, she\ncontinued to ponder visibly as she watched Lucien. He was talking with\nthe Bishop as if he were the king of the room; making no effort to\nfind any one out, waiting till others came to him, looking round about\nhim with varying expression, and as much at his ease as his model de\nMarsay. M. de Senonches appeared at no great distance, but Lucien\nstill stood beside the prelate.\n\nAt the end of ten minutes Louise could contain herself no longer. She\nrose and went over to the Bishop and said:\n\n\"What is being said, my lord, that you smile so often?\"\n\nLucien drew back discreetly, and left Mme. du Chatelet with his\nlordship.\n\n\"Ah! Mme. la Comtesse, what a clever young fellow he is! He was\nexplaining to me that he owed all he is to you----\"\n\n\"_I_ am not ungrateful, madame,\" said Lucien, with a reproachful\nglance that charmed the Countess.\n\n\"Let us have an understanding,\" she said, beckoning him with her fan.\n\"Come into the boudoir. My Lord Bishop, you shall judge between us.\"\n\n\"She has found a funny task for his lordship,\" said one of the\nChandour camp, sufficiently audibly.\n\n\"Judge between us!\" repeated Lucien, looking from the prelate to the\nlady; \"then, is one of us in fault?\"\n\nLouise de Negrepelisse sat down on the sofa in the familiar boudoir.\nShe made the Bishop sit on one side and Lucien on the other, then she\nbegan to speak. But Lucien, to the joy and surprise of his old love,\nhonored her with inattention; her words fell unheeded on his ears; he\nsat like Pasta in _Tancredi_, with the words _O patria!_ upon her lips,\nthe music of the great cavatina _Dell Rizzo_ might have passed into his\nface. Indeed, Coralie's pupil had contrived to bring the tears to his\neyes.\n\n\"Oh! Louise, how I loved you!\" he murmured, careless of the Bishop's\npresence, heedless of the conversation, as soon as he knew that the\nCountess had seen the tears.\n\n\"Dry your eyes, or you will ruin me here a second time,\" she said in\nan aside that horrified the prelate.\n\n\"And once is enough,\" was Lucien's quick retort. \"That speech from\nMme. d'Espard's cousin would dry the eyes of a weeping Magdalene. Oh\nme! for a little moment old memories, and lost illusions, and my\ntwentieth year came back to me, and you have----\"\n\nHis lordship hastily retreated to the drawing-room at this; it seemed\nto him that his dignity was like to be compromised by this sentimental\npair. Every one ostentatiously refrained from interrupting them, and a\nquarter of an hour went by; till at last Sixte du Chatelet, vexed by\nthe laughter and talk, and excursions to the boudoir door, went in\nwith a countenance distinctly overclouded, and found Louise and Lucien\ntalking excitedly.\n\n\"Madame,\" said Sixte in his wife's ear, \"you know Angouleme better\nthan I do, and surely you should think of your position as Mme. la\nPrefete and of the Government?\"\n\n\"My dear,\" said Louise, scanning her responsible editor with a\nhaughtiness that made him quake, \"I am talking with M. de Rubempre of\nmatters which interest you. It is a question of rescuing an inventor\nabout to fall a victim to the basest machinations; you will help us.\nAs to those ladies yonder, and their opinion of me, you shall see how\nI will freeze the venom of their tongues.\"\n\nShe came out of the boudoir on Lucien's arm, and drew him across to\nsign the contract with a great lady's audacity.\n\n\"Write your name after mine,\" she said, handing him the pen. And\nLucien submissively signed in the place indicated beneath her name.\n\n\"M. de Senonches, would you have recognized M. de Rubempre?\" she\ncontinued, and the insolent sportsman was compelled to greet Lucien.\n\nShe returned to the drawing-room on Lucien's arm, and seated him on\nthe awe-inspiring central sofa between herself and Zephirine. There,\nenthroned like a queen, she began, at first in a low voice, a\nconversation in which epigram evidently was not wanting. Some of her\nold friends, and several women who paid court to her, came to join the\ngroup, and Lucien soon became the hero of the circle. The Countess\ndrew him out on the subject of life in Paris; his satirical talk\nflowed with spontaneous and incredible spirit; he told anecdotes of\ncelebrities, those conversational luxuries which the provincial\ndevours with such avidity. His wit was as much admired as his good\nlooks. And Mme. la Comtesse Sixte du Chatelet, preparing Lucien's\ntriumph so patiently, sat like a player enraptured with the sound of\nhis instrument; she gave him opportunities for a reply; she looked\nround the circle for applause so openly, that not a few of the women\nbegan to think that their return together was something more than a\ncoincidence, and that Lucien and Louise, loving with all their hearts,\nhad been separated by a double treason. Pique, very likely, had\nbrought about this ill-starred match with Chatelet. And a reaction set\nin against the prefect.\n\nBefore the Countess rose to go at one o'clock in the morning, she\nturned to Lucien and said in a low voice, \"Do me the pleasure of\ncoming punctually to-morrow evening.\" Then, with the friendliest\nlittle nod, she went, saying a few words to Chatelet, who was looking\nfor his hat.\n\n\"If Mme. du Chatelet has given me a correct idea of the state of\naffairs, count on me, my dear Lucien,\" said the prefect, preparing to\nhurry after his wife. She was going away without him, after the Paris\nfashion. \"Your brother-in-law may consider that his troubles are at an\nend,\" he added as he went.\n\n\"M. le Comte surely owes me so much,\" smiled Lucien.\n\nCointet and Petit-Claud heard these farewell speeches.\n\n\"Well, well, we are done for now,\" Cointet muttered in his\nconfederate's ear. Petit-Claud, thunderstruck by Lucien's success,\namazed by his brilliant wit and varying charm, was gazing at Francoise\nde la Haye; the girl's whole face was full of admiration for Lucien.\n\"Be like your friend,\" she seemed to say to her betrothed. A gleam of\njoy flitted over Petit-Claud's countenance.\n\n\"We still have a whole day before the prefect's dinner; I will answer\nfor everything.\"\n\nAn hour later, as Petit-Claud and Lucien walked home together, Lucien\ntalked of his success. \"Well, my dear fellow, I came, I saw, I\nconquered! Sechard will be very happy in a few hours' time.\"\n\n\"Just what I wanted to know,\" thought Petit-Claud. Aloud he said--\"I\nthought you were simply a poet, Lucien, but you are a Lauzun too, that\nis to say--twice a poet,\" and they shook hands--for the last time, as\nit proved.\n\n\"Good news, dear Eve,\" said Lucien, waking his sister, \"David will\nhave no debts in less than a month!\"\n\n\"How is that?\"\n\n\"Well, my Louise is still hidden by Mme. du Chatelet's petticoat. She\nloves me more than ever; she will send a favorable report of our\ndiscovery to the Minister of the Interior through her husband. So we\nhave only to endure our troubles for one month, while I avenge myself\non the prefect and complete the happiness of his married life.\"\n\nEve listened, and thought that she must be dreaming.\n\n\"I saw the little gray drawing-room where I trembled like a child two\nyears ago; it seemed as if scales fell from my eyes when I saw the\nfurniture and the pictures and the faces again. How Paris changes\none's ideas!\"\n\n\"Is that a good thing?\" asked Eve, at last beginning to understand.\n\n\"Come, come; you are still asleep. We will talk about it to-morrow\nafter breakfast.\"\n\nCerizet's plot was exceedingly simple, a commonplace stratagem\nfamiliar to the provincial bailiff. Its success entirely depends upon\ncircumstances, and in this case it was certain, so intimate was\nCerizet's knowledge of the characters and hopes of those concerned.\nCerizet had been a kind of Don Juan among the young work-girls, ruling\nhis victims by playing one off against another. Since he had been the\nCointet's extra foreman, he had singled out one of Basine Clerget's\nassistants, a girl almost as handsome as Mme. Sechard. Henriette\nSignol's parents owned a small vineyard two leagues out of Angouleme,\non the road to Saintes. The Signols, like everybody else in the\ncountry, could not afford to keep their only child at home; so they\nmeant her to go out to service, in country phrase. The art of\nclear-starching is a part of every country housemaid's training; and\nso great was Mme. Prieur's reputation, that the Signols sent Henriette\nto her as apprentice, and paid for their daughter's board and lodging.\n\nMme. Prieur was one of the old-fashioned mistresses, who consider that\nthey fill a parent's place towards their apprentices. They were part\nof the family; she took them with her to church, and looked\nscrupulously after them. Henriette Signol was a tall, fine-looking\ngirl, with bold eyes, and long, thick, dark hair, and the pale, very\nfair complexion of girls in the South--white as a magnolia flower. For\nwhich reasons Henriette was one of the first on whom Cerizet cast his\neyes; but Henriette came of \"honest farmer folk,\" and only yielded at\nlast to jealousy, to bad example, and the treacherous promise of\nsubsequent marriage. By this time Cerizet was the Cointet's foreman.\nWhen he learned that the Signols owned a vineyard worth some ten or\ntwelve thousand francs, and a tolerably comfortable cottage, he\nhastened to make it impossible for Henriette to marry any one else.\nAffairs had reached this point when Petit-Claud held out the prospect\nof a printing office and twenty thousand francs of borrowed capital,\nwhich was to prove a yoke upon the borrower's neck. Cerizet was\ndazzled, the offer turned his head; Henriette Signol was now only an\nobstacle in the way of his ambitions, and he neglected the poor girl.\nHenriette, in her despair, clung more closely to her seducer as he\ntried to shake her off. When Cerizet began to suspect that David was\nhiding in Basine's house, his views with regard to Henriette underwent\nanother change, though he treated her as before. A kind of frenzy\nworks in a girl's brain when she must marry her seducer to conceal her\ndishonor, and Cerizet was on the watch to turn this madness to his own\naccount.\n\nDuring the morning of the day when Lucien had set himself to reconquer\nhis Louise, Cerizet told Basine's secret to Henriette, giving her to\nunderstand at the same time that their marriage and future prospects\ndepended upon the discovery of David's hiding-place. Thus instructed,\nHenriette easily made certain of the fact that David was in Basine\nClerget's inner room. It never occurred to the girl that she was doing\nwrong to act the spy, and Cerizet involved her in the guilt of\nbetrayal by this first step.\n\nLucien was still sleeping while Cerizet, closeted with Petit-Claud,\nheard the history of the important trifles with which all Angouleme\npresently would ring.\n\nThe Cointets' foreman gave a satisfied nod as Petit-Claud came to an\nend. \"Lucien surely has written you a line since he came back, has he\nnot?\" he asked.\n\n\"This is all that I have,\" answered the lawyer, and he held out a note\non Mme. Sechard's writing-paper.\n\n\"Very well,\" said Cerizet, \"let Doublon be in wait at the Palet Gate\nabout ten minutes before sunset; tell him to post his gendarmes, and\nyou shall have our man.\"\n\n\"Are you sure of _your_ part of the business?\" asked Petit-Claud,\nscanning Cerizet.\n\n\"I rely on chance,\" said the ex-street boy, \"and she is a saucy huzzy;\nshe does not like honest folk.\n\n\"You must succeed,\" said Cerizet. \"You have pushed me into this dirty\nbusiness; you may as well let me have a few banknotes to wipe off the\nstains.\"--Then detecting a look that he did not like in the attorney's\nface, he continued, with a deadly glance, \"If you have cheated me,\nsir, if you don't buy the printing-office for me within a week--you\nwill leave a young widow;\" he lowered his voice.\n\n\"If we have David on the jail register at six o'clock, come round to\nM. Gannerac's at nine, and we will settle your business,\" said\nPetit-Claud peremptorily.\n\n\"Agreed. Your will shall be done, governor,\" said Cerizet.\n\nCerizet understood the art of washing paper, a dangerous art for the\nTreasury. He washed out Lucien's four lines and replaced them,\nimitating the handwriting with a dexterity which augured ill for his\nown future:--\n\n\n  \"MY DEAR DAVID,--Your business is settled; you need not fear to go\n  to the prefect. You can go out at sunset. I will come to meet you\n  and tell you what to do at the prefecture.--Your brother,\n                                                           \"LUCIEN.\"\n\n\nAt noon Lucien wrote to David, telling him of his evening's success.\nThe prefect would be sure to lend his influence, he said; he was full\nof enthusiasm over the invention, and was drawing up a report that\nvery day to send to the Government. Marion carried the letter to\nBasine, taking some of Lucien's linen to the laundry as a pretext for\nthe errand.\n\nPetit-Claud had told Cerizet that a letter would in all probability be\nsent. Cerizet called for Mlle. Signol, and the two walked by the\nCharente. Henriette's integrity must have held out for a long while,\nfor the walk lasted for two hours. A whole future of happiness and\nease and the interests of a child were at stake, and Cerizet asked a\nmere trifle of her. He was very careful besides to say nothing of the\nconsequences of that trifle. She was only to carry a letter and a\nmessage, that was all; but it was the greatness of the reward for the\ntrifling service that frightened Henriette. Nevertheless, Cerizet\ngained her consent at last; she would help him in his stratagem.\n\nAt five o'clock Henriette must go out and come in again, telling\nBasine Clerget that Mme. Sechard wanted to speak to her at once.\nFifteen minutes after Basine's departure she must go upstairs, knock\nat the door of the inner room, and give David the forged note. That\nwas all. Cerizet looked to chance to manage the rest.\n\n\n\nFor the first time in twelve months, Eve felt the iron grasp of\nnecessity relax a little. She began at last to hope. She, too, would\nenjoy her brother's visit; she would show herself abroad on the arm of\na man feted in his native town, adored by the women, beloved by the\nproud Comtesse du Chatelet. She dressed herself prettily, and proposed\nto walk out after dinner with her brother to Beaulieu. In September\nall Angouleme comes out at that hour to breathe the fresh air.\n\n\"Oh! that is the beautiful Mme. Sechard,\" voices said here and there.\n\n\"I should never have believed it of her,\" said a woman.\n\n\"The husband is in hiding, and the wife walks abroad,\" said Mme.\nPostel for young Mme. Sechard's benefit.\n\n\"Oh, let us go home,\" said poor Eve; \"I have made a mistake.\"\n\nA few minutes before sunset, the sound of a crowd rose from the steps\nthat lead down to L'Houmeau. Apparently some crime had been committed,\nfor persons coming from L'Houmeau were talking among themselves.\nCuriosity drew Lucien and Eve towards the steps.\n\n\"A thief has just been arrested no doubt, the man looks as pale as\ndeath,\" one of these passers-by said to the brother and sister. The\ncrowd grew larger.\n\nLucien and Eve watched a group of some thirty children, old women and\nmen, returning from work, clustering about the gendarmes, whose\ngold-laced caps gleamed above the heads of the rest. About a hundred\npersons followed the procession, the crowd gathering like a storm\ncloud.\n\n\"Oh! it is my husband!\" Eve cried out.\n\n_\"David!\"_ exclaimed Lucien.\n\n\"It is his wife,\" said voices, and the crowd made way.\n\n\"What made you come out?\" asked Lucien.\n\n\"Your letter,\" said David, haggard and white.\n\n\"I knew it!\" said Eve, and she fainted away. Lucien raised his sister,\nand with the help of two strangers he carried her home; Marion laid\nher in bed, and Kolb rushed off for a doctor. Eve was still insensible\nwhen the doctor arrived; and Lucien was obliged to confess to his\nmother that he was the cause of David's arrest; for he, of course,\nknew nothing of the forged letter and Cerizet's stratagem. Then he\nwent up to his room and locked himself in, struck dumb by the\nmalediction in his mother's eyes.\n\nIn the dead of night he wrote one more letter amid constant\ninterruptions; the reader can divine the agony of the writer's mind\nfrom those phrases, jerked out, as it were, one by one:--\n\n\n  \"MY BELOVED SISTER,--We have seen each other for the last time. My\n  resolution is final, and for this reason. In many families there\n  is one unlucky member, a kind of disease in their midst. I am that\n  unlucky one in our family. The observation is not mine; it was\n  made at a friendly supper one evening at the _Rocher de Cancale_ by\n  a diplomate who has seen a great deal of the world. While we\n  laughed and joked, he explained the reason why some young lady or\n  some other remained unmarried, to the astonishment of the world\n  --it was 'a touch of her father,' he said, and with that he unfolded\n  his theory of inherited weaknesses. He told us how such and such a\n  family would have flourished but for the mother; how it was that a\n  son had ruined his father, or a father had stripped his children\n  of prospects and respectability. It was said laughingly, but we\n  thought of so many cases in point in ten minutes that I was struck\n  with the theory. The amount of truth in it furnished all sorts of\n  wild paradoxes, which journalists maintain cleverly enough for\n  their own amusement when there is nobody else at hand to mystify.\n  I bring bad luck to our family. My heart is full of love for you,\n  yet I behave like an enemy. The blow dealt unintentionally is the\n  cruelest blow of all. While I was leading a bohemian life in\n  Paris, a life made up of pleasure and misery; taking good\n  fellowship for friendship, forsaking my true friends for those who\n  wished to exploit me, and succeeded; forgetful of you, or\n  remembering you only to cause you trouble,--all that while you\n  were walking in the humble path of hard work, making your way\n  slowly but surely to the fortune which I tried so madly to snatch.\n  While you grew better, I grew worse; a fatal element entered into\n  my life through my own choice. Yes, unbounded ambition makes an\n  obscure existence simply impossible for me. I have tastes and\n  remembrances of past pleasures that poison the enjoyments within\n  my reach; once I should have been satisfied with them, now it is\n  too late. Oh, dear Eve, no one can think more hardly of me than I\n  do myself; my condemnation is absolute and pitiless. The struggle\n  in Paris demands steady effort; my will power is spasmodic, my\n  brain works intermittently. The future is so appalling that I do\n  not care to face it, and the present is intolerable.\n\n  \"I wanted to see you again. I should have done better to stay in\n  exile all my days. But exile without means of subsistence would be\n  madness; I will not add another folly to the rest. Death is better\n  than a maimed life; I cannot think of myself in any position in\n  which my overweening vanity would not lead me into folly.\n\n  \"Some human beings are like the figure 0, another must be put\n  before it, and they acquire ten times their value. I am nothing\n  unless a strong inexorable will is wedded to mine. Mme. de\n  Bargeton was in truth my wife; when I refused to leave Coralie for\n  her I spoiled my life. You and David might have been excellent\n  pilots for me, but you are not strong enough to tame my weakness,\n  which in some sort eludes control. I like an easy life, a life\n  without cares; to clear an obstacle out of my way I can descend to\n  baseness that sticks at nothing. I was born a prince. I have more\n  than the requisite intellectual dexterity for success, but only by\n  moments; and the prizes of a career so crowded by ambitious\n  competitors are to those who expend no more than the necessary\n  strength, and retain a sufficient reserve when they reach the\n  goal.\n\n  \"I shall do harm again with the best intentions in the world. Some\n  men are like oaks, I am a delicate shrub it may be, and I\n  forsooth, must needs aspire to be a forest cedar.\n\n  \"There you have my bankrupt's schedule. The disproportion between\n  my powers and my desires, my want of balance, in short, will bring\n  all my efforts to nothing. There are many such characters among\n  men of letters, many men whose intellectual powers and character\n  are always at variance, who will one thing and wish another. What\n  would become of me? I can see it all beforehand, as I think of\n  this and that great light that once shone on Paris, now utterly\n  forgotten. On the threshold of old age I shall be a man older than\n  my age, needy and without a name. My whole soul rises up against\n  the thought of such a close; I will not be a social rag. Ah, dear\n  sister, loved and worshiped at least as much for your severity at\n  the last as for your tenderness at the first--if we have paid so\n  dear for my joy at seeing you all once more, you and David may\n  perhaps some day think that you could grudge no price however high\n  for a little last happiness for an unhappy creature who loved you.\n  Do not try to find me, Eve; do not seek to know what becomes of\n  me. My intellect for once shall be backed by my will.\n  Renunciation, my angel, is daily death of self; my renunciation\n  will only last for one day; I will take advantage now of that\n  day. . . .\n\n                                                       \"_Two o'clock_.\n\n  \"Yes, I have quite made up my mind. Farewell for ever, dear Eve.\n  There is something sweet in the thought that I shall live only in\n  your hearts henceforth, and I wish no other burying place. Once\n  more, farewell. . . . That is the last word from your brother\n\n                                                           \"LUCIEN.\"\n\n\nLucien read the letter over, crept noiselessly down stairs, and left\nit in the child's cradle; amid falling tears he set a last kiss on the\nforehead of his sleeping sister; then he went out. He put out his\ncandle in the gray dusk, took a last look at the old house, stole\nsoftly along the passage, and opened the street door; but in spite of\nhis caution, he awakened Kolb, who slept on a mattress on the workshop\nfloor.\n\n\"Who goes there?\" cried Kolb.\n\n\"It is I, Lucien; I am going away, Kolb.\"\n\n\"You vould haf done better gif you at nefer kom,\" Kolb muttered\naudibly.\n\n\"I should have done better still if I had never come into the world,\"\nLucien answered. \"Good-bye, Kolb; I don't bear you any grudge for\nthinking as I think myself. Tell David that I was sorry I could not\nbid him good-bye, and say that this was my last thought.\"\n\nBy the time the Alsacien was up and dressed, Lucien had shut the house\ndoor, and was on his way towards the Charente by the Promenade de\nBeaulieu. He might have been going to a festival, for he had put on\nhis new clothes from Paris and his dandy's trinkets for a drowning\nshroud. Something in Lucien's tone had struck Kolb. At first the man\nthought of going to ask his mistress whether she knew that her brother\nhad left the house; but as the deepest silence prevailed, he concluded\nthat the departure had been arranged beforehand, and lay down again\nand slept.\n\nLittle, considering the gravity of the question, has been written on\nthe subject of suicide; it has not been studied. Perhaps it is a\ndisease that cannot be observed. Suicide is one effect of a sentiment\nwhich we will call self-esteem, if you will, to prevent confusion by\nusing the word \"honor.\" When a man despises himself, and sees that\nothers despise him, when real life fails to fulfil his hopes, then\ncomes the moment when he takes his life, and thereby does homage to\nsociety--shorn of his virtues or his splendor, he does not care to\nface his fellows. Among atheists--Christians being without the\nquestion of suicide--among atheists, whatever may be said to the\ncontrary, none but a base coward can take up a dishonored life.\n\nThere are three kinds of suicide--the first is only the last and acute\nstage of a long illness, and this kind belongs distinctly to\npathology; the second is the suicide of despair; and the third the\nsuicide based on logical argument. Despair and deductive reasoning had\nbrought Lucien to this pass, but both varieties are curable; it is\nonly the pathological suicide that is inevitable. Not infrequently you\nfind all three causes combined, as in the case of Jean-Jacques\nRousseau.\n\nLucien having made up his mind fell to considering methods. The poet\nwould fain die as became a poet. At first he thought of throwing\nhimself into the Charente and making an end then and there; but as he\ncame down the steps from Beaulieu for the last time, he heard the\nwhole town talking of his suicide; he saw the horrid sight of a\ndrowned dead body, and thought of the recognition and the inquest;\nand, like some other suicides, felt that vanity reached beyond death.\n\nHe remembered the day spent at Courtois' mill, and his thoughts\nreturned to the round pool among the willows that he saw as he came\nalong by the little river, such a pool as you often find on small\nstreams, with a still, smooth surface that conceals great depths\nbeneath. The water is neither green nor blue nor white nor tawny; it\nis like a polished steel mirror. No sword-grass grows about the\nmargin; there are no blue water forget-me-nots, nor broad lily leaves;\nthe grass at the brim is short and thick, and the weeping willows that\ndroop over the edge grow picturesquely enough. It is easy to imagine a\nsheer precipice beneath filled with water to the brim. Any man who\nshould have the courage to fill his pockets with pebbles would not\nfail to find death, and never be seen thereafter.\n\nAt the time while he admired the lovely miniature of a landscape, the\npoet had thought to himself, \"'Tis a spot to make your mouth water\nfor a _noyade_.\"\n\nHe thought of it now as he went down into L'Houmeau; and when he took\nhis way towards Marsac, with the last sombre thoughts gnawing at his\nheart, it was with the firm resolve to hide his death. There should be\nno inquest held over him, he would not be laid in earth; no one should\nsee him in the hideous condition of the corpse that floats on the\nsurface of the water. Before long he reached one of the slopes, common\nenough on all French highroads, and commonest of all between Angouleme\nand Poitiers. He saw the coach from Bordeaux to Paris coming up at\nfull speed behind him, and knew that the passengers would probably\nalight to walk up the hill. He did not care to be seen just then.\nTurning off sharply into a beaten track, he began to pick the flowers\nin a vineyard hard by.\n\nWhen Lucien came back to the road with a great bunch of the yellow\nstone-crop which grows everywhere upon the stony soil of the\nvineyards, he came out upon a traveler dressed in black from head to\nfoot. The stranger wore powder, there were silver buckles on his shoes\nof Orleans leather, and his brown face was scarred and seamed as if he\nhad fallen into the fire in infancy. The traveler, so obviously\nclerical in his dress, was walking slowly and smoking a cigar. He\nturned as Lucien jumped down from the vineyard into the road. The deep\nmelancholy on the handsome young face, the poet's symbolical flowers,\nand his elegant dress seemed to strike the stranger. He looked at\nLucien with something of the expression of a hunter that has found his\nquarry at last after long and fruitless search. He allowed Lucien to\ncome alongside in nautical phrase; then he slackened his pace, and\nappeared to look along the road up the hill; Lucien, following the\ndirection of his eyes, saw a light traveling carriage with two horses,\nand a post-boy standing beside it.\n\n\"You have allowed the coach to pass you, monsieur; you will lose your\nplace unless you care to take a seat in my caleche and overtake the\nmail, for it is rather quicker traveling post than by the public\nconveyance.\" The traveler spoke with extreme politeness and a very\nmarked Spanish accent.\n\nWithout waiting for an answer, he drew a cigar-case from his pocket,\nopened it, and held it out to Lucien.\n\n\"I am not on a journey,\" said Lucien, \"and I am too near the end of my\nstage to indulge in the pleasure of smoking----\"\n\n\"You are very severe with yourself,\" returned the Spaniard. \"Though I\nam a canon of the cathedral of Toledo, I occasionally smoke a\ncigarette. God gave us tobacco to allay our passions and our pains.\nYou seem to be downcast, or at any rate, you carry the symbolical\nflower of sorrow in your hand, like the rueful god Hymen. Come! all\nyour troubles will vanish away with the smoke,\" and again the\necclesiastic held out his little straw case; there was something\nfascinating in his manner, and kindliness towards Lucien lighted up\nhis eyes.\n\n\"Forgive me, father\" Lucien answered stiffly; \"there is no cigar that\ncan scatter my troubles.\" Tears came to his eyes at the words.\n\n\"It must surely be Divine Providence that prompted me to take a little\nexercise to shake off a traveler's morning drowsiness,\" said the\nchurchman. \"A divine prompting to fulfil my mission here on earth by\nconsoling you.--What great trouble can you have at your age?\"\n\n\"Your consolations, father, can do nothing for me. You are a Spaniard,\nI am a Frenchman; you believe in the commandments of the Church, I am\nan atheist.\"\n\n\"_Santa Virgen del Pilar_! you are an atheist!\" cried the other, laying\na hand on Lucien's arm with maternal solicitude. \"Ah! here is one of\nthe curious things I promised myself to see in Paris. We, in Spain, do\nnot believe in atheists. There is no country but France where one can\nhave such opinions at nineteen years.\"\n\n\"Oh! I am an atheist in the fullest sense of the word. I have no\nbelief in God, in society, in happiness. Take a good look at me,\nfather; for in a few hours' time life will be over for me. My last sun\nhas risen,\" said Lucien; with a sort of rhetorical effect he waved his\nhand towards the sky.\n\n\"How so; what have you done that you must die? Who has condemned you\nto die?\"\n\n\"A tribunal from which there is no appeal--I myself.\"\n\n\"You, child!\" cried the priest. \"Have you killed a man? Is the\nscaffold waiting for you? Let us reason together a little. If you are\nresolved, as you say, to return to nothingness, everything on earth is\nindifferent to you, is it not?\"\n\nLucien bowed assent.\n\n\"Very well, then; can you not tell me about your troubles? Some little\naffair of the heart has taken a bad turn, no doubt?\"\n\nLucien shrugged his shoulders very significantly.\n\n\"Are you resolved to kill yourself to escape dishonor, or do you\ndespair of life? Very good. You can kill yourself at Poitiers quite as\neasily as at Angouleme, and at Tours it will be no harder than at\nPoitiers. The quicksands of the Loire never give up their prey----\"\n\n\"No, father,\" said Lucien; \"I have settled it all. Not three weeks ago\nI chanced upon the most charming raft that can ferry a man sick and\ntired of this life into the other world----\"\n\n\"The other world? You are not an atheist.\"\n\n\"Oh! by another world I mean my next transformation, animal or plant.\"\n\n\"Have you some incurable disease?\"\n\n\"Yes, father.\"\n\n\"Ah! now we come to the point. What is it?\"\n\n\"Poverty.\"\n\nThe priest looked at Lucien. \"The diamond does not know its own\nvalue,\" he said, and there was an inexpressible charm, and a touch of\nsomething like irony in his smile.\n\n\"None but a priest could flatter a poor man about to die,\" exclaimed\nLucien.\n\n\"You are not going to die,\" the Spaniard returned authoritatively.\n\n\"I have heard many times of men that were robbed on the highroad, but\nI have never yet heard of one that found a fortune there,\" said\nLucien.\n\n\"You will hear of one now,\" said the priest, glancing towards the\ncarriage to measure the time still left for their walk together.\n\"Listen to me,\" he continued, with his cigar between his teeth; \"if\nyou are poor, that is no reason why you should die. I need a\nsecretary, for mine has just died at Barcelona. I am in the same\nposition as the famous Baron Goertz, minister of Charles XII. He was\ntraveling toward Sweden (just as I am going to Paris), and in some\nlittle town or other he chanced upon the son of a goldsmith, a young\nman of remarkable good looks, though they could scarcely equal yours.\n. . . Baron Goertz discerned intelligence in the young man (just as I\nsee poetry on your brow); he took him into his traveling carriage, as\nI shall take you very shortly; and of a boy condemned to spend his\ndays in burnishing spoons and forks and making trinkets in some little\ntown like Angouleme, he made a favorite, as you shall be mine.\n\n\"Arrived at Stockholm, he installed his secretary and overwhelmed him\nwith work. The young man spent his nights in writing, and, like all\ngreat workers, he contracted a bad habit, a trick--he took to chewing\npaper. The late M. de Malesherbes use to rap people over the knuckles;\nand he did this once, by the by, to somebody or other whose suit\ndepended upon him. The handsome young secretary began by chewing blank\npaper, found it insipid for a while, and acquired a taste for\nmanuscript as having more flavor. People did not smoke as yet in those\ndays. At last, from flavor to flavor, he began to chew parchment and\nswallow it. Now, at that time a treaty was being negotiated between\nRussia and Sweden. The States-General insisted that Charles XII.\nshould make peace (much as they tried in France to make Napoleon treat\nfor peace in 1814) and the basis of these negotiations was the treaty\nbetween the two powers with regard to Finland. Goertz gave the\noriginal into his secretary's keeping; but when the time came for\nlaying the draft before the States-General, a trifling difficulty\narose; the treaty was not to be found. The States-General believed\nthat the Minister, pandering to the King's wishes, had taken it into\nhis head to get rid of the document. Baron Goertz was, in fact,\naccused of this, and the secretary owned that he had eaten the treaty.\nHe was tried and convicted and condemned to death.--But you have not\ncome to that yet, so take a cigar and smoke till we reach the\ncaleche.\"\n\nLucien took a cigar and lit it, Spanish fashion, at the priest's\ncigar. \"He is right,\" he thought; \"I can take my life at any time.\"\n\n\"It often happens that a young man's fortunes take a turn when despair\nis darkest,\" the Spaniard continued. \"That is what I wished to tell\nyou, but I preferred to prove it by a case in point. Here was the\nhandsome young secretary lying under sentence of death, and his case\nthe more desperate because, as he had been condemned by the\nStates-General, the King could not pardon him, but he connived at his\nescape. The secretary stole away in a fishing-boat with a few crowns\nin his pocket, and reached the court of Courland with a letter of\nintroduction from Goertz, explaining his secretary's adventures and\nhis craze for paper. The Duke of Courland was a spendthrift; he had a\nsteward and a pretty wife--three several causes of ruin. He placed the\ncharming young stranger with his steward.\n\n\"If you can imagine that the sometime secretary had been cured of his\ndepraved taste by a sentence of death, you do not know the grip that a\nman's failings have upon him; let a man discover some satisfaction for\nhimself, and the headsman will not keep him from it.--How is it that\nthe vice has this power? Is it inherent strength in the vice, or\ninherent weakness in human nature? Are there certain tastes that\nshould be regarded as verging on insanity? For myself, I cannot help\nlaughing at the moralists who try to expel such diseases by fine\nphrases.--Well, it so fell out that the steward refused a demand for\nmoney; and the Duke taking fright at this, called for an audit. Sheer\nimbecility! Nothing easier than to make out a balance-sheet; the\ndifficulty never lies there. The steward gave his secretary all the\nnecessary documents for compiling a schedule of the civil list of\nCourland. He had nearly finished it when, in the dead of night, the\nunhappy paper-eater discovered that he was chewing up one of the\nDuke's discharges for a considerable sum. He had eaten half the\nsignature! Horror seized upon him; he fled to the Duchess, flung\nhimself at her feet, told her of his craze, and implored the aid of\nhis sovereign lady, implored her in the middle of the night. The\nhandsome young face made such an impression on the Duchess that she\nmarried him as soon as she was left a widow. And so in the mid-\neighteenth century, in a land where the king-at-arms is king, the\ngoldsmith's son became a prince, and something more. On the death of\nCatherine I. he was regent; he ruled the Empress Anne, and tried to be\nthe Richelieu of Russia. Very well, young man; now know this--if you\nare handsomer than Biron, I, simple canon that I am, am worth more\nthan a Baron Goertz. So get in; we will find a duchy of Courland for\nyou in Paris, or failing the duchy, we shall certainly find the\nduchess.\"\n\nThe Spanish priest laid a hand on Lucien's arm, and literally forced\nhim into the traveling carriage. The postilion shut the door.\n\n\"Now speak; I am listening,\" said the canon of Toledo, to Lucien's\nbewilderment. \"I am an old priest; you can tell me everything, there\nis nothing to fear. So far we have only run through our patrimony or\nsquandered mamma's money. We have made a flitting from our creditors,\nand we are honor personified down to the tips of our elegant little\nboots. . . . Come, confess, boldly; it will be just as if you were\ntalking to yourself.\"\n\nLucien felt like that hero of an Eastern tale, the fisher who tried to\ndrown himself in mid-ocean, and sank down to find himself a king of\ncountries under the sea. The Spanish priest seemed so really\naffectionate, that the poet hesitated no longer; between Angouleme and\nRuffec he told the story of his whole life, omitting none of his\nmisdeeds, and ended with the final catastrophe which he had brought\nabout. The tale only gained in poetic charm because this was the third\ntime he had told it in the past fortnight. Just as he made an end they\npassed the house of the Rastignac family.\n\n\"Young Rastignac left that place for Paris,\" said Lucien; \"he is\ncertainly not my equal, but he has had better luck.\"\n\nThe Spaniard started at the name. \"Oh!\" he said.\n\n\"Yes. That shy little place belongs to his father. As I was telling\nyou just now, he was the lover of Mme. de Nucingen, the famous\nbanker's wife. I drifted into poetry; he was cleverer, he took the\npractical side.\"\n\nThe priest stopped the caleche; and was so far curious as to walk down\nthe little avenue that led to the house, showing more interest in the\nplace than Lucien expected from a Spanish ecclesiastic.\n\n\"Then, do you know the Rastignacs?\" asked Lucien.\n\n\"I know every one in Paris,\" said the Spaniard, taking his place again\nin the carriage. \"And so for want of ten or twelve thousand francs,\nyou were about to take your life; you are a child, you know neither\nmen nor things. A man's future is worth the value that he chooses to\nset upon it, and you value yours at twelve thousand francs! Well, I\nwill give more than that for you any time. As for your\nbrother-in-law's imprisonment, it is the merest trifle. If this dear\nM. Sechard has made a discovery, he will be a rich man some day, and a\nrich man has never been imprisoned for debt. You do not seem to me to\nbe strong in history. History is of two kinds--there is the official\nhistory taught in schools, a lying compilation _ad usum delphini_; and\nthere is the secret history which deals with the real causes of events\n--a scandalous chronicle. Let me tell you briefly a little story which\nyou have not heard. There was, once upon a time, a man, young and\nambitious, and a priest to boot. He wanted to enter upon a political\ncareer, so he fawned on the Queen's favorite; the favorite took an\ninterest in him, gave him the rank of minister, and a seat at the\ncouncil board. One evening somebody wrote to the young aspirant,\nthinking to do him a service (never do a service, by the by, unless\nyou are asked), and told him that his benefactor's life was in danger.\nThe King's wrath was kindled against his rival; to-morrow, if the\nfavorite went to the palace, he would certainly be stabbed; so said\nthe letter. Well, now, young man, what would you have done?\"\n\n\"I should have gone at once to warn my benefactor,\" Lucien exclaimed\nquickly.\n\n\"You are indeed the child which your story reveals!\" said the priest.\n\"Our man said to himself, 'If the King is resolved to go to such\nlengths, it is all over with my benefactor; I must receive this letter\ntoo late;' so he slept on till the favorite was stabbed----\"\n\n\"He was a monster!\" said Lucien, suspecting that the priest meant to\nsound him.\n\n\"So are all great men; this one was the Cardinal de Richelieu, and his\nbenefactor was the Marechal d'Ancre. You really do not know your\nhistory of France, you see. Was I not right when I told you that\nhistory as taught in schools is simply a collection of facts and\ndates, more than doubtful in the first place, and with no bearing\nwhatever on the gist of the matter. You are told that such a person as\nJeanne Darc once existed; where is the use of that? Have you never\ndrawn your own conclusions from that fact? never seen that if France\nhad accepted the Angevin dynasty of the Plantagenets, the two peoples\nthus reunited would be ruling the world to-day, and the islands that\nnow brew political storms for the continent would be French provinces?\n. . . Why, have you so much as studied the means by which simple\nmerchants like the Medicis became Grand Dukes of Tuscany?\"\n\n\"A poet in France is not bound to be 'as learned as a Benedictine,'\"\nsaid Lucien.\n\n\"Well, they became Grand-Dukes as Richelieu became a minister. If you\nhad looked into history for the causes of events instead of getting\nthe headings by heart, you would have found precepts for your guidance\nin this life. These real facts taken at random from among so many\nsupply you with the axiom--'Look upon men, and on women most of all,\nas your instruments; but never let them see this.' If some one higher\nin place can be useful to you, worship him as your god; and never\nleave him until he has paid the price of your servility to the last\nfarthing. In your intercourse with men, in short, be grasping and mean\nas a Jew; all that the Jew does for money, you must do for power. And\nbesides all this, when a man has fallen from power, care no more for\nhim than if he had ceased to exist. And do you ask why you must do\nthese things? You mean to rule the world, do you not? You must begin\nby obeying and studying it. Scholars study books; politicians study\nmen, and their interests and the springs of action. Society and\nmankind in masses are fatalists; they bow down and worship the\naccomplished fact. Do you know why I am giving you this little history\nlesson? It seems to me that your ambition is boundless----\"\n\n\"Yes, father.\"\n\n\"I saw that myself,\" said the priest. \"But at this moment you are\nthinking, 'Here is this Spanish canon inventing anecdotes and\nstraining history to prove to me that I have too much virtue----'\"\n\nLucien began to smile; his thoughts had been read so clearly.\n\n\"Very well, let us take facts that every schoolboy knows. One day\nFrance is almost entirely overrun by the English; the King has only a\nsingle province left. Two figures arise from among the people--a poor\nherd girl, that very Jeanne Darc of whom we were speaking, and a\nburgher named Jacques Coeur. The girl brings the power of virginity,\nthe strength of her arm; the burgher gives his gold, and the kingdom\nis saved. The maid is taken prisoner, and the King, who could have\nransomed her, leaves her to be burned alive. The King allows his\ncourtier to accuse the great burgher of capital crime, and they rob\nhim and divide all his wealth among themselves. The spoils of an\ninnocent man, hunted down, brought to bay, and driven into exile by\nthe Law, went to enrich five noble houses; and the father of the\nArchbishop of Bourges left the kingdom for ever without one sou of all\nhis possessions in France, and no resource but moneys remitted to\nArabs and Saracens in Egypt. It is open to you to say that these\nexamples are out of date, that three centuries of public education\nhave since elapsed, and that the outlines of those ages are more or\nless dim figures. Well, young man, do you believe in the last demi-god\nof France, in Napoleon? One of his generals was in disgrace all\nthrough his career; Napoleon made him a marshal grudgingly, and never\nsent him on service if he could help it. That marshal was Kellermann.\nDo you know the reason of the grudge? . . . Kellermann saved France\nand the First Consul at Marengo by a brilliant charge; the ranks\napplauded under fire and in the thick of the carnage. That heroic\ncharge was not even mentioned in the bulletin. Napoleon's coolness\ntoward Kellermann, Fouche's fall, and Talleyrand's disgrace were all\nattributable to the same cause; it is the ingratitude of a Charles\nVII., or a Richelieu, or ----\"\n\n\"But, father,\" said Lucien, \"suppose that you should save my life and\nmake my fortune, you are making the ties of gratitude somewhat\nslight.\"\n\n\"Little rogue,\" said the Abbe, smiling as he pinched Lucien's ear with\nan almost royal familiarity. \"If you are ungrateful to me, it will be\nbecause you are a strong man, and I shall bend before you. But you are\nnot that just yet; as a simple 'prentice you have tried to be master\ntoo soon, the common fault of Frenchmen of your generation. Napoleon's\nexample has spoiled them all. You send in your resignation because you\nhave not the pair of epaulettes that you fancied. But have you\nattempted to bring the full force of your will and every action of\nyour life to bear upon your one idea?\"\n\n\"Alas! no.\"\n\n\"You have been inconsistent, as the English say,\" smiled the canon.\n\n\"What I have been matters nothing now,\" said Lucien, \"if I can be\nnothing in the future.\"\n\n\"If at the back of all your good qualities there is power _semper\nvirens_,\" continued the priest, not averse to show that he had a little\nLatin, \"nothing in this world can resist you. I have taken enough of a\nliking for you already----\"\n\nLucien smiled incredulously.\n\n\"Yes,\" said the priest, in answer to the smile, \"you interest me as\nmuch as if you had been my son; and I am strong enough to afford to\ntalk to you as openly as you have just done to me. Do you know what it\nis that I like about you?--This: you have made a sort of _tabula rasa_\nwithin yourself, and are ready to hear a sermon on morality that you\nwill hear nowhere else; for mankind in the mass are even more\nconsummate hypocrites than any one individual can be when his\ninterests demand a piece of acting. Most of us spend a good part of\nour lives in clearing our minds of the notions that sprang up\nunchecked during our nonage. This is called 'getting our\nexperience.'\"\n\nLucien, listening, thought within himself, \"Here is some old intriguer\ndelighted with a chance of amusing himself on a journey. He is pleased\nwith the idea of bringing about a change of opinion in a poor wretch\non the brink of suicide; and when he is tired of his amusement, he\nwill drop me. Still he understands paradox, and seems to be quite a\nmatch for Blondet or Lousteau.\"\n\nBut in spite of these sage reflections, the diplomate's poison had\nsunk deeply into Lucien's soul; the ground was ready to receive it,\nand the havoc wrought was the greater because such famous examples\nwere cited. Lucien fell under the charm of his companion's cynical\ntalk, and clung the more willingly to life because he felt that this\narm which drew him up from the depths was a strong one.\n\nIn this respect the ecclesiastic had evidently won the day; and,\nindeed, from time to time a malicious smile bore his cynical anecdotes\ncompany.\n\n\"If your system of morality at all resembles your manner of regarding\nhistory,\" said Lucien, \"I should dearly like to know the motive of\nyour present act of charity, for such it seems to be.\"\n\n\"There, young man, I have come to the last head of my sermon; you will\npermit me to reserve it, for in that case we shall not part company\nto-day,\" said the canon, with the tact of the priest who sees that his\nguile has succeeded.\n\n\"Very well, talk morality,\" said Lucien. To himself he said, \"I will\ndraw him out.\"\n\n\"Morality begins with the law,\" said the priest. \"If it were simply a\nquestion of religion, laws would be superfluous; religious peoples\nhave few laws. The laws of statecraft are above civil law. Well, do\nyou care to know the inscription which a politician can read, written\nat large over your nineteenth century? In 1793 the French invented the\nidea of the sovereignty of the people--and the sovereignty of the\npeople came to an end under the absolute ruler in the Emperor. So much\nfor your history as a nation. Now for your private manners. Mme.\nTallien and Mme. Beauharnais both acted alike. Napoleon married the\none, and made her your Empress; the other he would never receive at\ncourt, princess though she was. The sans-culotte of 1793 takes the\nIron Crown in 1804. The fanatical lovers of Equality or Death conspire\nfourteen years afterwards with a Legitimist aristocracy to bring back\nLouis XVIII. And that same aristocracy, lording it to-day in the\nFaubourg Saint-Germain, has done worse--has been merchant, usurer,\npastry-cook, farmer, and shepherd. So in France systems political and\nmoral have started from one point and reached another diametrically\nopposed; and men have expressed one kind of opinion and acted on\nanother. There has been no consistency in national policy, nor in the\nconduct of individuals. You cannot be said to have any morality left.\nSuccess is the supreme justification of all actions whatsoever. The\nfact in itself is nothing; the impression that it makes upon others is\neverything. Hence, please observe a second precept: Present a fair\nexterior to the world, keep the seamy side of life to yourself, and\nturn a resplendent countenance upon others. Discretion, the motto of\nevery ambitious man, is the watchword of our Order; take it for your\nown. Great men are guilty of almost as many base deeds as poor\noutcasts; but they are careful to do these things in shadow and to\nparade their virtues in the light, or they would not be great men.\nYour insignificant man leaves his virtues in the shade; he publicly\ndisplays his pitiable side, and is despised accordingly. You, for\ninstance, have hidden your titles to greatness and made a display of\nyour worst failings. You openly took an actress for your mistress,\nlived with her and upon her; you were by no means to blame for this;\neverybody admitted that both of you were perfectly free to do as you\nliked; but you ran full tilt against the ideas of the world, and the\nworld has not shown you the consideration that is shown to those who\nobey the rules of the game. If you had left Coralie to this M.\nCamusot, if you had hidden your relations with her, you might have\nmarried Mme. de Bargeton; you would now be prefect of Angouleme and\nMarquis de Rubempre.\n\n\"Change your tactics, bring your good looks, your charm, your wit,\nyour poetry to the front. If you indulge in small discreditable\ncourses, let it be within four walls, and you will never again be\nguilty of a blot on the decorations of this great theatrical scene\ncalled society. Napoleon called this 'washing dirty linen at home.'\nThe corollary follows naturally on this second precept--Form is\neverything. Be careful to grasp the meaning of that word 'form.' There\nare people who, for want of knowing better, will help themselves to\nmoney under pressure of want, and take it by force. These people are\ncalled criminals; and, perforce, they square accounts with Justice. A\npoor man of genius discovers some secret, some invention as good as a\ntreasure; you lend him three thousand francs (for that, practically,\nthe Cointets have done; they hold your bills, and they are about to\nrob your brother-in-law); you torment him until he reveals or partly\nreveals his secret; you settle your accounts with your own conscience,\nand your conscience does not drag you into the assize court.\n\n\"The enemies of social order, beholding this contrast, take occasion\nto yap at justice, and wax wroth in the name of the people, because,\nforsooth, burglars and fowl-stealers are sent to the hulks, while a\nman who brings whole families to ruin by a fraudulent bankruptcy is\nlet off with a few months' imprisonment. But these hypocrites know\nquite well that the judge who passes sentence on the thief is\nmaintaining the barrier set between the poor and the rich, and that if\nthat barrier were overturned, social chaos would ensue; while, in the\ncase of the bankrupt, the man who steals an inheritance cleverly, and\nthe banker who slaughters a business for his own benefit, money merely\nchanges hands, that is all.\n\n\"Society, my son, is bound to draw those distinctions which I have\npointed out for your benefit. The one great point is this--you must be\na match for society. Napoleon, Richelieu, and the Medicis were a match\nfor their generations. And as for you, you value yourself at twelve\nthousand francs! You of this generation in France worship the golden\ncalf; what else is the religion of your Charter that will not\nrecognize a man politically unless he owns property? What is this but\nthe command, 'Strive to be rich?' Some day, when you shall have made a\nfortune without breaking the law, you will be rich; you will be the\nMarquis de Rubempre, and you can indulge in the luxury of honor. You\nwill be so extremely sensitive on the point of honor that no one will\ndare to accuse you of past shortcomings if in the process of making\nyour way you should happen to smirch it now and again, which I myself\nshould never advise,\" he added, patting Lucien's hand.\n\n\"So what must you put in that comely head of yours? Simply this and\nnothing more--propose to yourself a brilliant and conspicuous goal,\nand go towards it secretly; let no one see your methods or your\nprogress. You have behaved like a child; be a man, be a hunter, lie in\nwait for your quarry in the world of Paris, wait for your chance and\nyour game; you need not be particular nor mindful of your dignity, as\nit is called; we are all of us slaves to something, to some failing of\nour own or to necessity; but keep that law of laws--secrecy.\"\n\n\"Father, you frighten me,\" said Lucien; \"this seems to me to be a\nhighwayman's theory.\"\n\n\"And you are right,\" said the canon, \"but it is no invention of mine.\nAll _parvenus_ reason in this way--the house of Austria and the house of\nFrance alike. You have nothing, you say? The Medicis, Richelieu, and\nNapoleon started from precisely your standpoint; but _they_, my child,\nconsidered that their prospects were worth ingratitude, treachery, and\nthe most glaring inconsistencies. You must dare all things to gain all\nthings. Let us discuss it. Suppose that you sit down to a game of\n_bouillotte_, do you begin to argue over the rules of the game? There\nthey are, you accept them.\"\n\n\"Come, now,\" thought Lucien, \"he can play _bouillotte_.\"\n\n\"And what do you do?\" continued the priest; \"do you practise openness,\nthat fairest of virtues? Not merely do you hide your tactics, but you\ndo your best to make others believe that you are on the brink of ruin\nas soon as you are sure of winning the game. In short, you dissemble,\ndo you not? You lie to win four or five louis d'or. What would you\nthink of a player so generous as to proclaim that he held a hand full\nof trumps? Very well; the ambitious man who carries virtue's precepts\ninto the arena when his antagonists have left them behind is behaving\nlike a child. Old men of the world might say to him, as card-players\nwould say to the man who declines to take advantage of his trumps,\n'Monsieur, you ought not to play at _bouillotte_.'\n\n\"Did you make the rules of the game of ambition? Why did I tell you to\nbe a match for society?--Because, in these days, society by degrees\nhas usurped so many rights over the individual, that the individual is\ncompelled to act in self-defence. There is no question of laws now,\ntheir place has been taken by custom, which is to say grimacings, and\nforms must always be observed.\"\n\nLucien started with surprise.\n\n\"Ah, my child!\" said the priest, afraid that he had shocked Lucien's\ninnocence; \"did you expect to find the Angel Gabriel in an Abbe loaded\nwith all the iniquities of the diplomacy and counter-diplomacy of two\nkings? I am an agent between Ferdinand VII. and Louis XVIII.,\ntwo--kings who owe their crowns to profound--er--combinations, let us\nsay. I believe in God, but I have a still greater belief in our Order,\nand our Order has no belief save in temporal power. In order to\nstrengthen and consolidate the temporal power, our Order upholds the\nCatholic Apostolic and Roman Church, which is to say, the doctrines\nwhich dispose the world at large to obedience. We are the Templars of\nmodern times; we have a doctrine of our own. Like the Templars, we have\nbeen dispersed, and for the same reasons; we are almost a match for the\nworld. If you will enlist as a soldier, I will be your captain. Obey\nme as a wife obeys her husband, as a child obeys his mother, and I\nwill guarantee that you shall be Marquis de Rubempre in less than six\nmonths; you shall marry into one of the proudest houses in the\nFaubourg Saint-Germain, and some day you shall sit on a bench with\npeers of France. What would you have been at this moment if I had not\namused you by my conversation?--An undiscovered corpse in a deep bed\nof mud. Well and good, now for an effort of imagination----\"\n\nLucien looked curiously at his protector.\n\n\"Here, in this caleche beside the Abbe Carlos Herrera, canon of\nToledo, secret envoy from His Majesty Ferdinand VII. to his Majesty\nthe King of France, bearer of a despatch thus worded it may be--'When\nyou have delivered me, hang all those whom I favor at this moment,\nmore especially the bearer of this despatch, for then he can tell no\ntales'--well, beside this envoy sits a young man who has nothing in\ncommon with that poet recently deceased. I have fished you out of the\nwater, I have brought you to life again, you belong to me as the\ncreature belongs to the creator, as the efrits of fairytales belong to\nthe genii, as the janissary to the Sultan, as the soul to the body. I\nwill sustain you in the way to power with a strong hand; and at the\nsame time I promise that your life shall be a continual course of\npleasure, honors, and enjoyment. You shall never want for money. You\nshall shine, you shall go bravely in the eyes of the world; while I,\ncrouching in the mud, will lay a firm foundation for the brilliant\nedifice of your fortunes. For I love power for its own sake. I shall\nalways rejoice in your enjoyment, forbidden to me. In short, my self\nshall become your self! Well, if a day should come when this pact\nbetween man and the tempter, this agreement between the child and the\ndiplomatist should no longer suit your ideas, you can still look about\nfor some quiet spot, like that pool of which you were speaking, and\ndrown yourself; you will only be as you are now, or a little more or a\nlittle less wretched and dishonored.\"\n\n\"This is not like the Archbishop of Granada's homily,\" said Lucien as\nthey stopped to change horses.\n\n\"Call this concentrated education by what name you will, my son, for\nyou are my son, I adopt you henceforth, and shall make you my heir; it\nis the Code of ambition. God's elect are few and far between. There is\nno choice, you must bury yourself in the cloister (and there you very\noften find the world again in miniature) or accept the Code.\"\n\n\"Perhaps it would be better not to be so wise,\" said Lucien, trying to\nfathom this terrible priest.\n\n\"What!\" rejoined the canon. \"You begin to play before you know the\nrules of the game, and now you throw it up just as your chances are\nbest, and you have a substantial godfather to back you! And you do not\neven care to play a return match? You do not mean to say that you have\nno mind to be even with those who drove you from Paris?\"\n\nLucien quivered; the sounds that rang through every nerve seemed to\ncome from some bronze instrument, some Chinese gong.\n\n\"I am only a poor priest,\" returned his mentor, and a grim expression,\ndreadful to behold, appeared for a moment on a face burned to a\ncopper-red by the sun of Spain, \"I am only a poor priest; but if I had\nbeen humiliated, vexed, tormented, betrayed, and sold as you have been\nby the scoundrels of whom you have told me, I should do like an Arab\nof the desert--I would devote myself body and soul to vengeance. I\nmight end by dangling from a gibbet, garroted, impaled, guillotined in\nyour French fashion, I should not care a rap; but they should not have\nmy head until I had crushed my enemies under my heel.\"\n\nLucien was silent; he had no wish to draw the priest out any further.\n\n\"Some are descended from Cain and some from Abel,\" the canon\nconcluded; \"I myself am of mixed blood--Cain for my enemies, Abel for\nmy friends. Woe to him that shall awaken Cain! After all, you are a\nFrenchman; I am a Spaniard, and, what is more, a canon.\"\n\n\"What a Tartar!\" thought Lucien, scanning the protector thus sent to\nhim by Heaven.\n\nThere was no sign of the Jesuit, nor even of the ecclesiastic, about\nthe Abbe Carlos Herrera. His hands were large, he was thick-set and\nbroad-chested, evidently he possessed the strength of a Hercules; his\nterrific expression was softened by benignity assumed at will; but a\ncomplexion of impenetrable bronze inspired feelings of repulsion\nrather than attachment for the man.\n\nThe strange diplomatist looked somewhat like a bishop, for he wore\npowder on his long, thick hair, after the fashion of the Prince de\nTalleyrand; a gold cross, hanging from a strip of blue ribbon with a\nwhite border, indicated an ecclesiastical dignitary. The outlines\nbeneath the black silk stockings would not have disgraced an athlete.\nThe exquisite neatness of his clothes and person revealed an amount of\ncare which a simple priest, and, above all, a Spanish priest, does not\nalways take with his appearance. A three-cornered hat lay on the front\nseat of the carriage, which bore the arms of Spain.\n\nIn spite of the sense of repulsion, the effect made by the man's\nappearance was weakened by his manner, fierce and yet winning as it\nwas; he evidently laid himself out to please Lucien, and the winning\nmanner became almost coaxing. Yet Lucien noticed the smallest trifles\nuneasily. He felt that the moment of decision had come; they had\nreached the second stage beyond Ruffec, and the decision meant life or\ndeath.\n\nThe Spaniard's last words vibrated through many chords in his heart,\nand, to the shame of both, it must be said that all that was worst in\nLucien responded to an appeal deliberately made to his evil impulses,\nand the eyes that studied the poet's beautiful face had read him very\nclearly. Lucien beheld Paris once more; in imagination he caught again\nat the reins of power let fall from his unskilled hands, and he\navenged himself! The comparisons which he himself had drawn so lately\nbetween the life of Paris and life in the provinces faded from his\nmind with the more painful motives for suicide; he was about to return\nto his natural sphere, and this time with a protector, a political\nintriguer unscrupulous as Cromwell.\n\n\"I was alone, now there will be two of us,\" he told himself. And then\nthis priest had been more and more interested as he told of his sins\none after another. The man's charity had grown with the extent of his\nmisdoings; nothing had astonished this confessor. And yet, what could\nbe the motive of a mover in the intrigues of kings? Lucien at first\nwas fain to be content with the banal answer--the Spanish are a\ngenerous race. The Spaniard is generous! even so the Italian is\njealous and a poisoner, the Frenchman fickle, the German frank, the\nJew ignoble, and the Englishman noble. Reverse these verdicts and you\nshall arrive within a reasonable distance of the truth! The Jews have\nmonopolized the gold of the world; they compose _Robert the Devil_, act\n_Phedre_, sing _William Tell_, give commissions for pictures and build\npalaces, write _Reisebilder_ and wonderful verse; they are more powerful\nthan ever, their religion is accepted, they have lent money to the\nHoly Father himself! As for Germany, a foreigner is often asked\nwhether he has a contract in writing, and this is in the smallest\nmatters, so tricky are they in their dealings. In France the spectacle\nof national blunders has never lacked national applause for the past\nfifty years; we continue to wear hats which no mortal can explain, and\nevery change of government is made on the express condition that\nthings shall remain exactly as they were before. England flaunts her\nperfidy in the face of the world, and her abominable treachery is only\nequaled by her greed. All the gold of two Indies passed through the\nhands of Spain, and now she has nothing left. There is no country in\nthe world where poison is so little in request as in Italy, no country\nwhere manners are easier or more gentle. As for the Spaniard, he has\ntraded largely on the reputation of the Moor.\n\nAs the Canon of Toledo returned to the caleche, he had spoken a word\nto the post-boy. \"Drive post-haste,\" he said, \"and there will be three\nfrancs for drink-money for you.\" Then, seeing that Lucien hesitated,\n\"Come! come!\" he exclaimed, and Lucien took his place again, telling\nhimself that he meant to try the effect of the _argumentum ad hominem_.\n\n\"Father,\" he began, \"after pouring out, with all the coolness in the\nworld, a series of maxims which the vulgar would consider profoundly\nimmoral----\"\n\n\"And so they are,\" said the priest; \"that is why Jesus Christ said\nthat it must needs be that offences come, my son; and that is why the\nworld displays such horror of offences.\"\n\n\"A man of your stamp will not be surprised by the question which I am\nabout to ask?\"\n\n\"Indeed, my son, you do not know me,\" said Carlos Herrera. \"Do you\nsuppose that I should engage a secretary unless I knew that I could\ndepend upon his principles sufficiently to be sure that he would not\nrob me? I like you. You are as innocent in every way as a\ntwenty-year-old suicide. Your question?\"\n\n\"Why do you take an interest in me? What price do you set on my\nobedience? Why should you give me everything? What is your share?\"\n\nThe Spaniard looked at Lucien, and a smile came over his face.\n\n\"Let us wait till we come to the next hill; we can walk up and talk\nout in the open. The back seat of a traveling carriage is not the\nplace for confidences.\"\n\nThey traveled in silence for sometime; the rapidity of the movement\nseemed to increase Lucien's moral intoxication.\n\n\"Here is a hill, father,\" he said at last awakening from a kind of\ndream.\n\n\"Very well, we will walk.\" The Abbe called to the postilion to stop,\nand the two sprang out upon the road.\n\n\"You child,\" said the Spaniard, taking Lucien by the arm, \"have you\never thought over Otway's _Venice Preserved_? Did you understand the\nprofound friendship between man and man which binds Pierre and Jaffier\neach to each so closely that a woman is as nothing in comparison, and\nall social conditions are changed?--Well, so much for the poet.\"\n\n\"So the canon knows something of the drama,\" thought Lucien. \"Have you\nread Voltaire?\" he asked.\n\n\"I have done better,\" said the other; \"I put his doctrine in\npractice.\"\n\n\"You do not believe in God?\"\n\n\"Come! it is I who am the atheist, is it?\" the Abbe said, smiling.\n\"Let us come to practical matters, my child,\" he added, putting an arm\nround Lucien's waist. \"I am forty-six years old, I am the natural son\nof a great lord; consequently, I have no family, and I have a heart.\nBut, learn this, carve it on that still so soft brain of yours--man\ndreads to be alone. And of all kinds of isolation, inward isolation is\nthe most appalling. The early anchorite lived with God; he dwelt in\nthe spirit world, the most populous world of all. The miser lives in a\nworld of imagination and fruition; his whole life and all that he is,\neven his sex, lies in his brain. A man's first thought, be he leper or\nconvict, hopelessly sick or degraded, is to find another with a like\nfate to share it with him. He will exert the utmost that is in him,\nevery power, all his vital energy, to satisfy that craving; it is his\nvery life. But for that tyrannous longing, would Satan have found\ncompanions? There is a whole poem yet to be written, a first part of\n_Paradise Lost_; Milton's poem is only the apology for the revolt.\"\n\n\"It would be the Iliad of Corruption,\" said Lucien.\n\n\"Well, I am alone, I live alone. If I wear the priest's habit, I have\nnot a priest's heart. I like to devote myself to some one; that is my\nweakness. That is my life, that is how I came to be a priest. I am not\nafraid of ingratitude, and I am grateful. The Church is nothing to me;\nit is an idea. I am devoted to the King of Spain, but you cannot give\naffection to a King of Spain; he is my protector, he towers above me.\nI want to love my creature, to mould him, fashion him to my use, and\nlove him as a father loves his child. I shall drive in your tilbury,\nmy boy, enjoy your success with women, and say to myself, 'This fine\nyoung fellow, this Marquis de Rubempre, my creation whom I have\nbrought into this great world, is my very Self; his greatness is my\ndoing, he speaks or is silent with my voice, he consults me in\neverything.' The Abbe de Vermont felt thus for Marie-Antoinette.\"\n\n\"He led her to the scaffold.\"\n\n\"He did not love the Queen,\" said the priest. \"HE only loved the Abbe\nde Vermont.\"\n\n\"Must I leave desolation behind me?\"\n\n\"I have money, you shall draw on me.\"\n\n\"I would do a great deal just now to rescue David Sechard,\" said\nLucien, in the tone of one who has given up all idea of suicide.\n\n\"Say but one word, my son, and by to-morrow morning he shall have\nmoney enough to set him free.\"\n\n\"What! Would you give me twelve thousand francs?\"\n\n\"Ah! child, do you not see that we are traveling on at the rate of\nfour leagues an hour? We shall dine at Poitiers before long, and\nthere, if you decide to sign the pact, to give me a single proof of\nobedience, a great proof that I shall require, then the Bordeaux coach\nshall carry fifteen thousand francs to your sister----\"\n\n\"Where is the money?\"\n\nThe Spaniard made no answer, and Lucien said within himself, \"There I\nhad him; he was laughing at me.\"\n\nIn another moment they took their places. Neither of them said a word.\nSilently the Abbe groped in the pocket of the coach, and drew out a\ntraveler's leather pouch with three divisions in it; thence he took a\nhundred Portuguese moidores, bringing out his large hand filled with\ngold three times.\n\n\"Father, I am yours,\" said Lucien, dazzled by the stream of gold.\n\n\"Child!\" said the priest, and set a tender kiss on Lucien's forehead.\n\"There is twice as much still left in the bag, besides the money for\ntraveling expenses.\"\n\n\"And you are traveling alone!\" cried Lucien.\n\n\"What is that?\" asked the Spaniard. \"I have more than a hundred\nthousand crowns in drafts on Paris. A diplomatist without money is in\nyour position of this morning--a poet without a will of his own!\"\n\n\n\nAs Lucien took his place in the caleche beside the so-called Spanish\ndiplomatist, Eve rose to give her child a draught of milk, found the\nfatal letter in the cradle, and read it. A sudden cold chilled the\ndamps of morning slumber, dizziness came over her, she could not see.\nShe called aloud to Marion and Kolb.\n\n\"Has my brother gone out?\" she asked, and Kolb answered at once with,\n\"Yes, Montame, pefore tay.\"\n\n\"Keep this that I am going to tell you a profound secret,\" said Eve.\n\"My brother has gone no doubt to make away with himself. Hurry, both\nof you, make inquiries cautiously, and look along the river.\"\n\nEve was left alone in a dull stupor, dreadful to see. Her trouble was\nat its height when Petit-Claud came in at seven o'clock to talk over\nthe steps to be taken in David's case. At such a time, any voice in\nthe world may speak, and we let them speak.\n\n\"Our poor, dear David is in prison, madame,\" so began Petit-Claud. \"I\nforesaw all along that it would end in this. I advised him at the time\nto go into partnership with his competitors the Cointets; for while\nyour husband has simply the idea, they have the means of putting it\ninto practical shape. So as soon as I heard of his arrest yesterday\nevening, what did I do but hurry away to find the Cointets and try to\nobtain such concessions as might satisfy you. If you try to keep the\ndiscovery to yourselves, you will continue to live a life of shifts\nand chicanery. You must give in, or else when you are exhausted and at\nthe last gasp, you will end by making a bargain with some capitalist\nor other, and perhaps to your own detriment, whereas to-day I hope to\nsee you make a good one with MM. Cointet. In this way you will save\nyourselves the hardships and the misery of the inventor's duel with\nthe greed of the capitalist and the indifference of the public. Let us\nsee! If the MM. Cointet should pay your debts--if, over and above your\ndebts, they should pay you a further sum of money down, whether or no\nthe invention succeeds; while at the same time it is thoroughly\nunderstood that if it succeeds a certain proportion of the profits of\nworking the patent shall be yours, would you not be doing very well?\n--You yourself, madame, would then be the proprietor of the plant in\nthe printing-office. You would sell the business, no doubt; it is quite\nworth twenty thousand francs. I will undertake to find you a buyer at\nthat price.\n\n\"Now if you draw up a deed of partnership with the MM. Cointet, and\nreceive fifteen thousand francs of capital; and if you invest it in\nthe funds at the present moment, it will bring you in an income of two\nthousand francs. You can live on two thousand francs in the provinces.\nBear in mind, too, madame, that, given certain contingencies, there\nwill be yet further payments. I say 'contingencies,' because we must\nlay our accounts with failure.\n\n\"Very well,\" continued Petit-Claud, \"now these things I am sure that I\ncan obtain for you. First of all, David's release from prison;\nsecondly, fifteen thousand francs, a premium paid on his discovery,\nwhether the experiments fail or succeed; and lastly, a partnership\nbetween David and the MM. Cointet, to be taken out after private\nexperiment made jointly. The deed of partnership for the working of\nthe patent should be drawn up on the following basis: The MM. Cointet\nto bear all the expenses, the capital invested by David to be confined\nto the expenses of procuring the patent, and his share of the profits\nto be fixed at twenty-five per cent. You are a clear-headed and very\nsensible woman, qualities which are not often found combined with\ngreat beauty; think over these proposals, and you will see that they\nare very favorable.\"\n\nPoor Eve in her despair burst into tears. \"Ah, sir! why did you not\ncome yesterday evening to tell me this? We should have been spared\ndisgrace and--and something far worse----\"\n\n\"I was talking with the Cointets until midnight. They are behind\nMetivier, as you must have suspected. But how has something worse than\nour poor David's arrest happened since yesterday evening?\"\n\n\"Here is the awful news that I found when I awoke this morning,\" she\nsaid, holding out Lucien's letter. \"You have just given me proof of\nyour interest in us; you are David's friend and Lucien's; I need not\nask you to keep the secret----\"\n\n\"You need not feel the least anxiety,\" said Petit-Claud, as he\nreturned the letter. \"Lucien will not take his life. Your husband's\narrest was his doing; he was obliged to find some excuse for leaving\nyou, and this exit of his looks to me like a piece of stage business.\"\n\nThe Cointets had gained their ends. They had tormented the inventor\nand his family, until, worn out by the torture, the victims longed for\na respite, and then seized their opportunity and made the offer. Not\nevery inventor has the tenacity of the bull-dog that will perish with\nhis teeth fast set in his capture; the Cointets had shrewdly estimated\nDavid's character. The tall Cointet looked upon David's imprisonment\nas the first scene of the first act of the drama. The second act\nopened with the proposal which Petit-Claud had just made. As\narch-schemer, the attorney looked upon Lucien's frantic folly as a bit\nof unhoped-for luck, a chance that would finally decide the issues of\nthe day.\n\nEve was completely prostrated by this event; Petit-Claud saw this, and\nmeant to profit by her despair to win her confidence, for he saw at\nlast how much she influenced her husband. So far from discouraging\nEve, he tried to reassure her, and very cleverly diverted her thoughts\nto the prison. She should persuade David to take the Cointets into\npartnership.\n\n\"David told me, madame, that he only wished for a fortune for your\nsake and your brother's; but it should be clear to you by now that to\ntry to make a rich man of Lucien would be madness. The youngster would\nrun through three fortunes.\"\n\nEve's attitude told plainly enough that she had no more illusions left\nwith regard to her brother. The lawyer waited a little so that her\nsilence should have the weight of consent.\n\n\"Things being so, it is now a question of you and your child,\" he\nsaid. \"It rests with you to decide whether an income of two thousand\nfrancs will be enough for your welfare, to say nothing of old\nSechard's property. Your father-in-law's income has amounted to seven\nor eight thousand francs for a long time past, to say nothing of\ncapital lying out at interest. So, after all, you have a good prospect\nbefore you. Why torment yourself?\"\n\nPetit-Claud left Eve Sechard to reflect upon this prospect. The whole\nscheme had been drawn up with no little skill by the tall Cointet the\nevening before.\n\n\"Give them the glimpse of a possibility of money in hand,\" the lynx\nhad said, when Petit-Claud brought the news of the arrest; \"once let\nthem grow accustomed to that idea, and they are ours; we will drive a\nbargain, and little by little we shall bring them down to our price\nfor the secret.\"\n\nThe argument of the second act of the commercial drama was in a manner\nsummed up in that speech.\n\nMme. Sechard, heartbroken and full of dread for her brother's fate,\ndressed and came downstairs. An agony of terror seized her when she\nthought that she must cross Angouleme alone on the way to the prison.\nPetit-Claud gave little thought to his fair client's distress. When he\ncame back to offer his arm, it was from a tolerably Machiavellian\nmotive; but Eve gave him credit for delicate consideration, and he\nallowed her to thank him for it. The little attention, at such a\nmoment, from so hard a man, modified Mme. Sechard's previous opinion\nof Petit-Claud.\n\n\"I am taking you round by the longest way,\" he said, \"and we shall\nmeet nobody.\"\n\n\"For the first time in my life, monsieur, I feel that I have no right\nto hold up my head before other people; I had a sharp lesson given to\nme last night----\"\n\n\"It will be the first and the last.\"\n\n\"Oh! I certainly shall not stay in the town now----\"\n\n\"Let me know if your husband consents to the proposals that are all\nbut definitely offered by the Cointets,\" said Petit-Claud at the gate\nof the prison; \"I will come at once with an order for David's release\nfrom Cachan, and in all likelihood he will not go back again to\nprison.\"\n\nThis suggestion, made on the very threshold of the jail, was a piece\nof cunning strategy--a _combinazione_, as the Italians call an\nindefinable mixture of treachery and truth, a cunningly planned fraud\nwhich does not break the letter of the law, or a piece of deft\ntrickery for which there is no legal remedy. St. Bartholomew's for\ninstance, was a political combination.\n\nImprisonment for debt, for reasons previously explained, is such a\nrare occurrence in the provinces, that there is no house of detention,\nand a debtor is perforce imprisoned with the accused, convicted, and\ncondemned--the three graduated subdivisions of the class generically\nstyled criminal. David was put for the time being in a cell on the\nground floor from which some prisoner had probably been recently\ndischarged at the end of his time. Once inscribed on the jailer's\nregister, with the amount allowed by the law for a prisoner's board\nfor one month, David confronted a big, stout man, more powerful than\nthe King himself in a prisoner's eyes; this was the jailer.\n\nAn instance of a thin jailer is unknown in the provinces. The place,\nto begin with, is almost a sinecure, and a jailer is a kind of\ninnkeeper who pays no rent and lives very well, while his prisoners\nfare very ill; for, like an innkeeper, he gives them rooms according\nto their payments. He knew David by name, and what was more, knew\nabout David's father, and thought that he might venture to let the\nprinter have a good room on credit for one night; for David was\npenniless.\n\nThe prison of Angouleme was built in the Middle Ages, and has no more\nchanged than the old cathedral. It is built against the old _presidial_,\nor ancient court of appeal, and people still call it the _maison de\njustice_. It boasts the conventional prison gateway, the solid-looking,\nnail-studded door, the low, worn archway which the better deserves the\nqualification \"cyclopean,\" because the jailer's peephole or _judas_\nlooks out like a single eye from the front of the building. As you\nenter you find yourself in a corridor which runs across the entire\nwidth of the building, with a row of doors of cells that give upon the\nprison yard and are lighted by high windows covered with a square iron\ngrating. The jailer's house is separated from these cells by an\narchway in the middle, through which you catch a glimpse of the iron\ngate of the prison yard. The jailer installed David in a cell next to\nthe archway, thinking that he would like to have a man of David's\nstamp as a near neighbor for the sake of company.\n\n\"This is the best room,\" he said. David was struck dumb with amazement\nat the sight of it.\n\nThe stone walls were tolerably damp. The windows, set high in the\nwall, were heavily barred; the stone-paved floor was cold as ice, and\nfrom the corridor outside came the sound of the measured tramp of the\nwarder, monotonous as waves on the beach. \"You are a prisoner! you are\nwatched and guarded!\" said the footsteps at every moment of every\nhour. All these small things together produce a prodigious effect upon\nthe minds of honest folk. David saw that the bed was execrable, but\nthe first night in a prison is full of violent agitation, and only on\nthe second night does the prisoner notice that his couch is hard. The\njailer was graciously disposed; he naturally suggested that his\nprisoner should walk in the yard until nightfall.\n\nDavid's hour of anguish only began when he was locked into his cell\nfor the night. Lights are not allowed in the cells. A prisoner\ndetained on arrest used to be subjected to rules devised for\nmalefactors, unless he brought a special exemption signed by the\npublic prosecutor. The jailer certainly might allow David to sit by\nhis fire, but the prisoner must go back to his cell at locking-up\ntime. Poor David learned the horrors of prison life by experience, the\nrough coarseness of the treatment revolted him. Yet a revulsion,\nfamiliar to those who live by thought, passed over him. He detached\nhimself from his loneliness, and found a way of escape in a poet's\nwaking dream.\n\nAt last the unhappy man's thoughts turned to his own affairs. The\nstimulating influence of a prison upon conscience and self-scrutiny is\nimmense. David asked himself whether he had done his duty as the head\nof a family. What despairing grief his wife must feel at this moment!\nWhy had he not done as Marion had said, and earned money enough to\npursue his investigations at leisure?\n\n\"How can I stay in Angouleme after such a disgrace? And when I come\nout of prison, what will become of us? Where shall we go?\"\n\nDoubts as to his process began to occur to him, and he passed through\nan agony which none save inventors can understand. Going from doubt to\ndoubt, David began to see his real position more clearly; and to\nhimself he said, as the Cointets had said to old Sechard, as\nPetit-Claud had just said to Eve, \"Suppose that all should go well,\nwhat does it amount to in practice? The first thing to be done is to\ntake out a patent, and money is needed for that--and experiments must\nbe tried on a large scale in a paper-mill, which means that the\ndiscovery must pass into other hands. Oh! Petit-Claud was right!\"\n\nA very vivid light sometimes dawns in the darkest prison.\n\n\"Pshaw!\" said David; \"I shall see Petit-Claud to-morrow no doubt,\" and\nhe turned and slept on the filthy mattress covered with coarse brown\nsacking.\n\nSo when Eve unconsciously played into the hands of the enemy that\nmorning, she found her husband more than ready to listen to proposals.\nShe put her arms about him and kissed him, and sat down on the edge of\nthe bed (for there was but one chair of the poorest and commonest kind\nin the cell). Her eyes fell on the unsightly pail in a corner, and\nover the walls covered with inscriptions left by David's predecessors,\nand tears filled the eyes that were red with weeping. She had sobbed\nlong and very bitterly, but the sight of her husband in a felon's cell\ndrew fresh tears.\n\n\"And the desire of fame may lead one to this!\" she cried. \"Oh! my\nangel, give up your career. Let us walk together along the beaten\ntrack; we will not try to make haste to be rich, David. . . . I need\nvery little to be very happy, especially now, after all that we have\nbeen through. . . . And if you only knew--the disgrace of arrest is\nnot the worst. . . . Look.\"\n\nShe held out Lucien's letter, and when David had read it, she tried to\ncomfort him by repeating Petit-Claud's bitter comment.\n\n\"If Lucien has taken his life, the thing is done by now,\" said David;\n\"if he has not made away with himself by this time, he will not kill\nhimself. As he himself says, 'his courage cannot last longer than a\nmorning----'\"\n\n\"But the suspense!\" cried Eve, forgiving almost everything at the\nthought of death. Then she told her husband of the proposals which\nPetit-Claud professed to have received from the Cointets. David\naccepted them at once with manifest pleasure.\n\n\"We shall have enough to live upon in a village near L'Houmeau, where\nthe Cointets' paper-mill stands. I want nothing now but a quiet life,\"\nsaid David. \"If Lucien has punished himself by death, we can wait so\nlong as father lives; and if Lucien is still living, poor fellow, he\nwill learn to adapt himself to our narrow ways. The Cointets certainly\nwill make money by my discovery; but, after all, what am I compared\nwith our country? One man in it, that is all; and if the whole country\nis benefited, I shall be content. There! dear Eve, neither you nor I\nwere meant to be successful in business. We do not care enough about\nmaking a profit; we have not the dogged objection to parting with our\nmoney, even when it is legally owing, which is a kind of virtue of the\ncounting-house, for these two sorts of avarice are called prudence and\na faculty of business.\"\n\nEve felt overjoyed; she and her husband held the same views, and this\nis one of the sweetest flowers of love; for two human beings who love\neach other may not be of the same mind, nor take the same view of\ntheir interests. She wrote to Petit-Claud telling him that they both\nconsented to the general scheme, and asked him to release David. Then\nshe begged the jailer to deliver the message.\n\nTen minutes later Petit-Claud entered the dismal place. \"Go home,\nmadame,\" he said, addressing Eve, \"we will follow you.--Well, my dear\nfriend\" (turning to David), \"so you allowed them to catch you! Why did\nyou come out? How came you to make such a mistake?\"\n\n\"Eh! how could I do otherwise? Look at this letter that Lucien wrote.\"\n\nDavid held out a sheet of paper. It was Cerizet's forged letter.\n\nPetit-Claud read it, looked at it, fingered the paper as he talked,\nand still taking, presently, as if through absence of mind, folded it\nup and put it in his pocket. Then he linked his arm in David's, and\nthey went out together, the order for release having come during the\nconversation.\n\nIt was like heaven to David to be at home again. He cried like a child\nwhen he took little Lucien in his arms and looked round his room after\nthree weeks of imprisonment, and the disgrace, according to provincial\nnotions, of the last few hours. Kolb and Marion had come back. Marion\nhad heard in L'Houmeau that Lucien had been seen walking along on the\nParis road, somewhere beyond Marsac. Some country folk, coming in to\nmarket, had noticed his fine clothes. Kolb, therefore, had set out on\nhorseback along the highroad, and heard at last at Mansle that Lucien\nwas traveling post in a caleche--M. Marron had recognized him as he\npassed.\n\n\"What did I tell you?\" said Petit-Claud. \"That fellow is not a poet;\nhe is a romance in heaven knows how many chapters.\"\n\n\"Traveling post!\" repeated Eve. \"Where can he be going this time?\"\n\n\"Now go to see the Cointets, they are expecting you,\" said\nPetit-Claud, turning to David.\n\n\"Ah, monsieur!\" cried the beautiful Eve, \"pray do your best for our\ninterests; our whole future lies in your hands.\"\n\n\"If you prefer it, madame, the conference can be held here. I will\nleave David with you. The Cointets will come this evening, and you\nshall see if I can defend your interests.\"\n\n\"Ah! monsieur, I should be very glad,\" said Eve.\n\n\"Very well,\" said Petit-Claud; \"this evening, at seven o'clock.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" said Eve; and from her tone and glance Petit-Claud knew\nthat he had made great progress in his fair client's confidence.\n\n\"You have nothing to fear; you see I was right,\" he added. \"Your\nbrother is a hundred miles away from suicide, and when all comes to\nall, perhaps you will have a little fortune this evening. A _bona-fide_\npurchaser for the business has turned up.\"\n\n\"If that is the case,\" said Eve, \"why should we not wait awhile before\nbinding ourselves to the Cointets?\"\n\nPetit-Claud saw the danger. \"You are forgetting, madame,\" he said,\n\"that you cannot sell your business until you have paid M. Metivier;\nfor a distress warrant has been issued.\"\n\nAs soon as Petit-Claud reached home he sent for Cerizet, and when the\nprinter's foreman appeared, drew him into the embrasure of the window.\n\n\"To-morrow evening,\" he said, \"you will be the proprietor of the\nSechards' printing-office, and then there are those behind you who\nhave influence enough to transfer the license;\" (then in a lowered\nvoice), \"but you have no mind to end in the hulks, I suppose?\"\n\n\"The hulks! What's that? What's that?\"\n\n\"Your letter to David was a forgery. It is in my possession. What\nwould Henriette say in a court of law? I do not want to ruin you,\" he\nadded hastily, seeing how white Cerizet's face grew.\n\n\"You want something more of me?\" cried Cerizet.\n\n\"Well, here it is,\" said Petit-Claud. \"Follow me carefully. You will\nbe a master printer in Angouleme in two months' time . . . but you\nwill not have paid for your business--you will not pay for it in ten\nyears. You will work a long while yet for those that have lent you the\nmoney, and you will be the cat's-paw of the Liberal party. . . . Now\n_I_ shall draw up your agreement with Gannerac, and I can draw it up\nin such a way that you will have the business in your own hands one of\nthese days. But--if the Liberals start a paper, if you bring it out,\nand if I am deputy public prosecutor, then you will come to an\nunderstanding with the Cointets and publish articles of such a nature\nthat they will have the paper suppressed. . . . The Cointets will pay\nyou handsomely for that service. . . . I know, of course, that you\nwill be a hero, a victim of persecution; you will be a personage among\nthe Liberals--a Sergeant Mercier, a Paul-Louis Courier, a Manual on a\nsmall scale. I will take care that they leave you your license. In\nfact, on the day when the newspaper is suppressed, I will burn this\nletter before your eyes. . . . Your fortune will not cost you much.\"\n\nA working man has the haziest notions as to the law with regard to\nforgery; and Cerizet, who beheld himself already in the dock, breathed\nagain.\n\n\"In three years' time,\" continued Petit-Claud, \"I shall be public\nprosecutor in Angouleme. You may have need of me some day; bear that\nin mind.\"\n\n\"It's agreed,\" said Cerizet, \"but you don't know me. Burn that letter\nnow and trust to my gratitude.\"\n\nPetit-Claud looked Cerizet in the face. It was a duel in which one\nman's gaze is a scalpel with which he essays to probe the soul of\nanother, and the eyes of that other are a theatre, as it were, to\nwhich all his virtue is summoned for display.\n\nPetit-Claud did not utter a word. He lighted a taper and burned the\nletter. \"He has his way to make,\" he said to himself.\n\n\"Here is one that will go through fire and water for you,\" said\nCerizet.\n\n\n\nDavid awaited the interview with the Cointets with a vague feeling of\nuneasiness; not, however, on account of the proposed partnership, nor\nfor his own interests--he felt nervous as to their opinion of his\nwork. He was in something the same position as a dramatic author\nbefore his judges. The inventor's pride in the discovery so nearly\ncompleted left no room for any other feelings.\n\nAt seven o'clock that evening, while Mme. du Chatelet, pleading a sick\nheadache, had gone to her room in her unhappiness over the rumors of\nLucien's departure; while M. de Comte, left to himself, was\nentertaining his guests at dinner--the tall Cointet and his stout\nbrother, accompanied by Petit-Claud, opened negotiations with the\ncompetitor who had delivered himself up, bound hand and foot.\n\nA difficulty awaited them at the outset. How was it possible to draw\nup a deed of partnership unless they knew David's secret? And if David\ndivulged his secret, he would be at the mercy of the Cointets.\nPetit-Claud arranged that the deed of partnership should be the first\ndrawn up. Thereupon the tall Cointet asked to see some specimens of\nDavid's work, and David brought out the last sheet that he had made,\nguaranteeing the price of production.\n\n\"Well,\" said Petit-Claud, \"there you have the basis of the agreement\nready made. You can go into partnership on the strength of those\nsamples, inserting a clause to protect yourselves in case the\nconditions of the patent are not fulfilled in the manufacturing\nprocess.\"\n\n\"It is one thing to make samples of paper on a small scale in your own\nroom with a small mould, monsieur, and another to turn out a\nquantity,\" said the tall Cointet, addressing David. \"Quite another\nthing, as you may judge from this single fact. We manufacture colored\npapers. We buy parcels of coloring absolutely identical. Every cake of\nindigo used for 'blueing' our post-demy is taken from a batch supplied\nby the same maker. Well, we have never yet been able to obtain two\nbatches of precisely the same shade. There are variations in the\nmaterial which we cannot detect. The quantity and the quality of the\npulp modify every question at once. Suppose that you have in a caldron\na quantity of ingredients of some kind (I don't ask to know what they\nare), you can do as you like with them, the treatment can be uniformly\napplied, you can manipulate, knead, and pestle the mass at your\npleasure until you have a homogeneous substance. But who will\nguarantee that it will be the same with a batch of five hundred reams,\nand that your plan will succeed in bulk?\"\n\nDavid, Eve, and Petit-Claud looked at one another; their eyes said\nmany things.\n\n\"Take a somewhat similar case,\" continued the tall Cointet after a\npause. \"You cut two or three trusses of meadow hay, and store it in a\nloft before 'the heat is out of the grass,' as the peasants say; the\nhay ferments, but no harm comes of it. You follow up your experiment\nby storing a couple of thousand trusses in a wooden barn--and, of\ncourse, the hay smoulders, and the barn blazes up like a lighted\nmatch. You are an educated man,\" continued Cointet; \"you can see the\napplication for yourself. So far, you have only cut your two trusses\nof hay; we are afraid of setting fire to our paper-mill by bringing in\na couple of thousand trusses. In other words, we may spoil more than\none batch, make heavy losses, and find ourselves none the better for\nlaying out a good deal of money.\"\n\nDavid was completely floored by this reasoning. Practical wisdom spoke\nin matter-of-fact language to theory, whose word is always for the\nfuture.\n\n\"Devil fetch me, if I'll sign such a deed of partnership!\" the stout\nCointet cried bluntly. \"You may throw away your money if you like,\nBoniface; as for me, I shall keep mine. Here is my offer--to pay M.\nSechard's debts _and_ six thousand francs, and another three thousand\nfrancs in bills at twelve and fifteen months,\" he added. \"That will be\nquite enough risk to run.--We have a balance of twelve thousand francs\nagainst Metivier. That will make fifteen thousand francs.--That is all\nthat I would pay for the secret if I were going to exploit it for\nmyself. So this is the great discovery that you were talking about,\nBoniface! Many thanks! I thought you had more sense. No, you can't\ncall this business.\"\n\n\"The question for you,\" said Petit-Claud, undismayed by the explosion,\n\"resolves itself into this: 'Do you care to risk twenty thousand\nfrancs to buy a secret that may make rich men of you?' Why, the risk\nusually is in proportion to the profit, gentlemen. You stake twenty\nthousand francs on your luck. A gambler puts down a louis at roulette\nfor a chance of winning thirty-six, but he knows that the louis is\nlost. Do the same.\"\n\n\"I must have time to think it over,\" said the stout Cointet; \"I am not\nso clever as my brother. I am a plain, straight-forward sort of chap,\nthat only knows one thing--how to print prayer-books at twenty sous\nand sell them for two francs. Where I see an invention that has only\nbeen tried once, I see ruin. You succeed with the first batch, you\nspoil the next, you go on, and you are drawn in; for once put an arm\ninto that machinery, the rest of you follows,\" and he related an\nanecdote very much to the point--how a Bordeaux merchant had ruined\nhimself by following a scientific man's advice, and trying to bring\nthe Landes into cultivation; and followed up the tale with\nhalf-a-dozen similar instances of agricultural and commercial failures\nnearer home in the departments of the Charente and Dordogne. He waxed\nwarm over his recitals. He would not listen to another word.\nPetit-Claud's demurs, so far from soothing the stout Cointet, appeared\nto irritate him.\n\n\"I would rather give more for a certainty, if I made only a small\nprofit on it,\" he said, looking at his brother. \"It is my opinion that\nthings have gone far enough for business,\" he concluded.\n\n\"Still you came here for something, didn't you?\" asked Petit-Claud.\n\"What is your offer?\"\n\n\"I offer to release M. Sechard, and, if his plan succeeds, to give him\nthirty per cent of the profits,\" the stout Cointet answered briskly.\n\n\"But, monsieur,\" objected Eve, \"how should we live while the\nexperiments were being made? My husband has endured the disgrace of\nimprisonment already; he may as well go back to prison, it makes no\ndifference now, and we will pay our debts ourselves----\"\n\nPetit-Claud laid a finger on his lips in warning.\n\n\"You are unreasonable,\" said he, addressing the brothers. \"You have\nseen the paper; M. Sechard's father told you that he had shut his son\nup, and that he had made capital paper in a single night from\nmaterials that must have cost a mere nothing. You are here to make an\noffer. Are you purchasers, yes or no?\"\n\n\"Stay,\" said the tall Cointet, \"whether my brother is willing or no, I\nwill risk this much myself. I will pay M. Sechard's debts, I will pay\nsix thousand francs over and above the debts, and M. Sechard shall\nhave thirty per cent of the profits. But mind this--if in the space of\none year he fails to carry out the undertakings which he himself will\nmake in the deed of partnership, he must return the six thousand\nfrancs, and we shall keep the patent and extricate ourselves as best\nwe may.\"\n\n\"Are you sure of yourself?\" asked Petit-Claud, taking David aside.\n\n\"Yes,\" said David. He was deceived by the tactics of the brothers, and\nafraid lest the stout Cointet should break off the negotiations on\nwhich his future depended.\n\n\"Very well, I will draft the deed,\" said Petit-Claud, addressing the\nrest of the party. \"Each of you shall have a copy to-night, and you\nwill have all to-morrow morning in which to think it over. To-morrow\nafternoon at four o'clock, when the court rises, you will sign the\nagreement. You, gentlemen, will withdraw Metivier's suit, and I, for\nmy part, will write to stop proceedings in the Court-Royal; we will\ngive notice on either side that the affair has been settled out of\ncourt.\"\n\nDavid Sechard's undertakings were thus worded in the deed:--\n\n\n  \"M. David Sechard, printer of Angouleme, affirming that he has\n  discovered a method of sizing paper-pulp in the vat, and also a\n  method of affecting a reduction of fifty per cent in the price of\n  all kinds of manufactured papers, by introducing certain vegetable\n  substances into the pulp, either by intermixture of such\n  substances with the rags already in use, or by employing them\n  solely without the addition of rags: a partnership for working the\n  patent to be presently applied for is entered upon by M. David\n  Sechard and the firm of Cointet Brothers, subject to the following\n  conditional clauses and stipulations.\"\n\n\nOne of the clauses so drafted that David Sechard forfeited all his\nrights if he failed to fulfil his engagements within the year; the\ntall Cointet was particularly careful to insert that clause, and David\nSechard allowed it to pass.\n\nWhen Petit-Claud appeared with a copy of the agreement next morning at\nhalf-past seven o'clock, he brought news for David and his wife.\nCerizet offered twenty-two thousand francs for the business. The whole\naffair could be signed and settled in the course of the evening. \"But\nif the Cointets knew about it,\" he added, \"they would be quite capable\nof refusing to sign the deed of partnership, of harassing you, and\nselling you up.\"\n\n\"Are you sure of payment?\" asked Eve. She had thought it hopeless to\ntry to sell the business; and now, to her astonishment, a bargain\nwhich would have been their salvation three months ago was concluded\nin this summary fashion.\n\n\"The money has been deposited with me,\" he answered succinctly.\n\n\"Why, here is magic at work!\" said David, and he asked Petit-Claud for\nan explanation of this piece of luck.\n\n\"No,\" said Petit-Claud, \"it is very simple. The merchants in L'Houmeau\nwant a newspaper.\"\n\n\"But I am bound not to publish a paper,\" said David.\n\n\"Yes, you are bound, but is your successor?--However it is,\" he\ncontinued, \"do not trouble yourself at all; sell the business, pocket\nthe proceeds, and leave Cerizet to find his way through the conditions\nof the sale--he can take care of himself.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Eve.\n\n\"And if it turns out that you may not print a newspaper in Angouleme,\"\nsaid Petit-Claud, \"those who are finding the capital for Cerizet will\nbring out the paper in L'Houmeau.\"\n\nThe prospect of twenty-two thousand francs, of want now at end,\ndazzled Eve. The partnership and its hopes took a second place. And,\ntherefore, M. and Mme. Sechard gave way on a final point of dispute.\nThe tall Cointet insisted that the patent should be taken out in the\nname of any one of the partners. What difference could it make? The\nstout Cointet said the last word.\n\n\"He is finding the money for the patent; he is bearing the expenses of\nthe journey--another two thousand francs over and above the rest of\nthe expenses. He must take it out in his own name, or we will not stir\nin the matter.\"\n\nThe lynx gained a victory at all points. The deed of partnership was\nsigned that afternoon at half-past four.\n\nThe tall Cointet politely gave Mme. Sechard a dozen thread-pattern\nforks and spoons and a beautiful Ternaux shawl, by way of pin-money,\nsaid he, and to efface any unpleasant impression made in the heat of\ndiscussion. The copies of the draft had scarcely been made out, Cachan\nhad barely had time to send the documents to Petit-Claud, together\nwith the three unlucky forged bills, when the Sechards heard a\ndeafening rumble in the street, a dray from the Messageries stopped\nbefore the door, and Kolb's voice made the staircase ring again.\n\n\"Montame! montame! vifteen tausend vrancs, vrom Boidiers\" (Poitiers).\n\"Goot money! vrom Monziere Lucien!\"\n\n\"Fifteen thousand francs!\" cried Eve, throwing up her arms.\n\n\"Yes, madame,\" said the carman in the doorway, \"fifteen thousand\nfrancs, brought by the Bordeaux coach, and they didn't want any more\nneither! I have two men downstairs bringing up the bags. M. Lucien\nChardon de Rubempre is the sender. I have brought up a little leather\nbag for you, containing five hundred francs in gold, and a letter it's\nlikely.\"\n\nEve thought that she must be dreaming as she read:--\n\n\n  \"MY DEAR SISTER,--Here are fifteen thousand francs. Instead of\n  taking my life, I have sold it. I am no longer my own; I am only\n  the secretary of a Spanish diplomatist; I am his creature. A new\n  and dreadful life is beginning for me. Perhaps I should have done\n  better to drown myself.\n\n  \"Good-bye. David will be released, and with the four thousand\n  francs he can buy a little paper-mill, no doubt, and make his\n  fortune. Forget me, all of you. This is the wish of your unhappy\n  brother.\n                                                           \"LUCIEN.\"\n\n\n\"It is decreed that my poor boy should be unlucky in everything, and\neven when he does well, as he said himself,\" said Mme. Chardon, as she\nwatched the men piling up the bags.\n\n\"We have had a narrow escape!\" exclaimed the tall Cointet, when he was\nonce more in the Place du Murier. \"An hour later the glitter of the\nsilver would have thrown a new light on the deed of partnership. Our\nman would have fought shy of it. We have his promise now, and in three\nmonths' time we shall know what to do.\"\n\nThat very evening, at seven o'clock, Cerizet bought the business, and\nthe money was paid over, the purchaser undertaking to pay rent for the\nlast quarter. The next day Eve sent forty thousand francs to the\nReceiver-General, and bought two thousand five hundred francs of\n_rentes_ in her husband's name. Then she wrote to her father-in-law and\nasked him to find a small farm, worth about ten thousand francs, for\nher near Marsac. She meant to invest her own fortune in this way.\n\nThe tall Cointet's plot was formidably simple. From the very first he\nconsidered that the plan of sizing the pulp in the vat was\nimpracticable. The real secret of fortune lay in the composition of\nthe pulp, in the cheap vegetable fibre as a substitute for rags. He\nmade up his mind, therefore, to lay immense stress on the secondary\nproblem of sizing the pulp, and to pass over the discovery of cheap\nraw material, and for the following reasons:\n\nThe Angouleme paper-mills manufacture paper for stationers. Notepaper,\nfoolscap, crown, and post-demy are all necessarily sized; and these\npapers have been the pride of the Angouleme mills for a long while\npast, stationery being the specialty of the Charente. This fact gave\ncolor to the Cointet's urgency upon the point of sizing in the\npulping-trough; but, as a matter of fact, they cared nothing for this\npart of David's researches. The demand for writing-paper is\nexceedingly small compared with the almost unlimited demand for\nunsized paper for printers. As Boniface Cointet traveled to Paris to\ntake out the patent in his own name, he was projecting plans that were\nlike to work a revolution in his paper-mill. Arrived in Paris, he took\nup his quarters with Metivier, and gave his instructions to his agent.\nMetivier was to call upon the proprietors of newspapers, and offer to\ndeliver paper at prices below those quoted by all other houses; he\ncould guarantee in each case that the paper should be a better color,\nand in every way superior to the best kinds hitherto in use.\nNewspapers are always supplied by contract; there would be time before\nthe present contracts expired to complete all the subterranean\noperations with buyers, and to obtain a monopoly of the trade. Cointet\ncalculated that he could rid himself of Sechard while Metivier was\ntaking orders from the principal Paris newspapers, which even then\nconsumed two hundred reams daily. Cointet naturally offered Metivier a\nlarge commission on the contracts, for he wished to secure a clever\nrepresentative on the spot, and to waste no time in traveling to and\nfro. And in this manner the fortunes of the firm of Metivier, one of\nthe largest houses in the paper trade, were founded. The tall Cointet\nwent back to Angouleme to be present at Petit-Claud's wedding, with a\nmind at rest as to the future.\n\nPetit-Claud had sold his professional connection, and was only waiting\nfor M. Milaud's promotion to take the public prosecutor's place, which\nhad been promised to him by the Comtesse du Chatelet. The public\nprosecutor's second deputy was appointed first deputy to the Court of\nLimoges, the Keeper of the Seals sent a man of his own to Angouleme,\nand the post of first deputy was kept vacant for a couple of months.\nThe interval was Petit-Claud's honeymoon.\n\nWhile Boniface Cointet was in Paris, David made a first experimental\nbatch of unsized paper far superior to that in common use for\nnewspapers. He followed it up with a second batch of magnificent\nvellum paper for fine printing, and this the Cointets used for a new\nedition of their diocesan prayer-book. The material had been privately\nprepared by David himself; he would have no helpers but Kolb and\nMarion.\n\nWhen Boniface came back the whole affair wore a different aspect; he\nlooked at the samples, and was fairly satisfied.\n\n\"My good friend,\" he said, \"the whole trade of Angouleme is in crown\npaper. We must make the best possible crown paper at half the present\nprice; that is the first and foremost question for us.\"\n\nThen David tried to size the pulp for the desired paper, and the\nresult was a harsh surface with grains of size distributed all over\nit. On the day when the experiment was concluded and David held the\nsheets in his hand, he went away to find a spot where he could be\nalone and swallow his bitter disappointment. But Boniface Cointet went\nin search of him and comforted him. Boniface was delightfully amiable.\n\n\"Do not lose heart,\" he said; \"go on! I am a good fellow, I understand\nyou; I will stand by you to the end.\"\n\n\"Really,\" David said to his wife at dinner, \"we are with good people;\nI should not have expected that the tall Cointet would be so\ngenerous.\" And he repeated his conversation with his wily partner.\n\nThree months were spent in experiments. David slept at the mill; he\nnoted the effects of various preparations upon the pulp. At one time\nhe attributed his non-success to an admixture of rag-pulp with his own\ningredients, and made a batch entirely composed of the new material;\nat another, he endeavored to size pulp made exclusively from rags;\npersevering in his experiments under the eyes of the tall Cointet,\nwhom he had ceased to mistrust, until he had tried every possible\ncombination of pulp and size. David lived in the paper-mill for the\nfirst six months of 1823--if it can be called living, to leave food\nuntasted, and go in neglect of person and dress. He wrestled so\ndesperately with the difficulties, that anybody but the Cointets would\nhave seen the sublimity of the struggle, for the brave fellow was not\nthinking of his own interests. The moment had come when he cared for\nnothing but the victory. With marvelous sagacity he watched the\nunaccountable freaks of the semi-artificial substances called into\nexistence by man for ends of his own; substances in which nature had\nbeen tamed, as it were, and her tacit resistance overcome; and from\nthese observations drew great conclusions; finding, as he did, that\nsuch creations can only be obtained by following the laws of the more\nremote affinities of things, of \"a second nature,\" as he called it, in\nsubstances.\n\nTowards the end of August he succeeded to some extent in sizing the\npaper pulp in the vat; the result being a kind of paper identical with\na make in use for printers' proofs at the present day--a kind of paper\nthat cannot be depended upon, for the sizing itself is not always\ncertain. This was a great result, considering the condition of the\npaper trade in 1823, and David hoped to solve the final difficulties\nof the problem, but--it had cost ten thousand francs.\n\nSingular rumors were current at this time in Angouleme and L'Houmeau.\nIt was said that David Sechard was ruining the firm of Cointet\nBrothers. Experiments had eaten up twenty thousand francs; and the\nresult, said gossip, was wretchedly bad paper. Other manufacturers\ntook fright at this, hugged themselves on their old-fashioned methods,\nand, being jealous of the Cointets, spread rumors of the approaching\nfall of that ambitious house. As for the tall Cointet, he set up the\nnew machinery for making lengths of paper in a ribbon, and allowed\npeople to believe that he was buying plant for David's experiments.\nThen the cunning Cointet used David's formula for pulp, while urging\nhis partner to give his whole attention to the sizing process; and\nthousands of reams of the new paper were despatched to Metivier in\nParis.\n\nWhen September arrived, the tall Cointet took David aside, and,\nlearning that the latter meditated a crowning experiment, dissuaded\nhim from further attempts.\n\n\"Go to Marsac, my dear David, see your wife, and take a rest after\nyour labors; we don't want to ruin ourselves,\" said Cointet in the\nfriendliest way. \"This great triumph of yours, after all, is only a\nstarting-point. We shall wait now for awhile before trying any new\nexperiments. To be fair! see what has come of them. We are not merely\npaper-makers, we are printers besides and bankers, and people say that\nyou are ruining us.\"\n\nDavid Sechard's gesture of protest on behalf of his good faith was\nsublime in its simplicity.\n\n\"Not that fifty thousand francs thrown into the Charente would ruin\nus,\" said Cointet, in reply to mute protest, \"but we do not wish to be\nobliged to pay cash for everything in consequence of slanders that\nshake our credit; _that_ would bring us to a standstill. We have reached\nthe term fixed by our agreement, and we are bound on either side to\nthink over our position.\"\n\n\"He is right,\" thought David. He had forgotten the routine work of the\nbusiness, thoroughly absorbed as he had been in experiments on a large\nscale.\n\nDavid went to Marsac. For the past six months he had gone over on\nSaturday evening, returning again to L'Houmeau on Tuesday morning.\nEve, after much counsel from her father-in-law, had bought a house\ncalled the Verberie, with three acres of land and a croft planted with\nvines, which lay like a wedge in the old man's vineyard. Here, with\nher mother and Marion, she lived a very frugal life, for five thousand\nfrancs of the purchase money still remained unpaid. It was a charming\nlittle domain, the prettiest bit of property in Marsac. The house,\nwith a garden before it and a yard at the back, was built of white\ntufa ornamented with carvings, cut without great expense in that\neasily wrought stone, and roofed with slate. The pretty furniture from\nthe house in Angouleme looked prettier still at Marsac, for there was\nnot the slightest attempt at comfort or luxury in the country in those\ndays. A row of orange-trees, pomegranates, and rare plants stood\nbefore the house on the side of the garden, set there by the last\nowner, an old general who died under M. Marron's hands.\n\nDavid was enjoying his holiday sitting under an orange-tree with his\nwife, and father, and little Lucien, when the bailiff from Mansle\nappeared. Cointet Brothers gave their partner formal notice to appoint\nan arbitrator to settle disputes, in accordance with a clause in the\nagreement. The Cointets demanded that the six thousand francs should\nbe refunded, and the patent surrendered in consideration of the\nenormous outlay made to no purpose.\n\n\"People say that you are ruining them,\" said old Sechard. \"Well, well,\nof all that you have done, that is the one thing that I am glad to\nknow.\"\n\nAt nine o'clock the next morning Eve and David stood in Petit-Claud's\nwaiting-room. The little lawyer was the guardian of the widow and\norphan by virtue of his office, and it seemed to them that they could\ntake no other advice. Petit-Claud was delighted to see his clients,\nand insisted that M. and Mme. Sechard should do him the pleasure of\nbreakfasting with him.\n\n\"Do the Cointets want six thousand francs of you?\" he asked, smiling.\n\"How much is still owing of the purchase-money of the Verberie?\"\n\n\"Five thousand francs, monsieur,\" said Eve, \"but I have two\nthousand----\"\n\n\"Keep your money,\" Petit-Claud broke in. \"Let us see: five\nthousand--why, you want quite another ten thousand francs to settle\nyourselves comfortably down yonder. Very good, in two hours' time the\nCointets shall bring you fifteen thousand francs----\"\n\nEve started with surprise.\n\n\"If you will renounce all claims to the profits under the deed of\npartnership, and come to an amicable settlement,\" said Petit-Claud.\n\"Does that suit you?\"\n\n\"Will it really be lawfully ours?\" asked Eve.\n\n\"Very much so,\" said the lawyer, smiling. \"The Cointets have worked\nyou trouble enough; I should like to make an end of their pretensions.\nListen to me; I am a magistrate now, and it is my duty to tell you the\ntruth. Very good. The Cointets are playing you false at this moment,\nbut you are in their hands. If you accept battle, you might possibly\ngain the lawsuit which they will bring. Do you wish to be where you\nare now after ten years of litigation? Experts' fees and expenses of\narbitration will be multiplied, the most contradictory opinions will\nbe given, and you must take your chance. And,\" he added, smiling\nagain, \"there is no attorney here that can defend you, so far as I\nsee. My successor has not much ability. There, a bad compromise is\nbetter than a successful lawsuit.\"\n\n\"Any arrangement that will give us a quiet life will do for me,\" said\nDavid.\n\nPetit-Claud called to his servant.\n\n\"Paul! go and ask M. Segaud, my successor, to come here.--He shall go\nto see the Cointets while we breakfast\" said Petit-Claud, addressing\nhis former clients, \"and in a few hours' time you will be on your way\nhome to Marsac, ruined, but with minds at rest. Ten thousand francs\nwill bring you in another five hundred francs of income, and you will\nlive comfortably on your bit of property.\"\n\nTwo hours later, as Petit-Claud had prophesied, Maitre Segaud came\nback with an agreement duly drawn up and signed by the Cointets, and\nfifteen notes each for a thousand francs.\n\n\"We are much indebted to you,\" said Sechard, turning to Petit-Claud.\n\n\"Why, I have just this moment ruined you,\" said Petit-Claud, looking\nat his astonished former clients. \"I tell you again, I have ruined\nyou, as you will see as time goes on; but I know you, you would rather\nbe ruined than wait for a fortune which perhaps might come too late.\"\n\n\"We are not mercenary, monsieur,\" said Madame Eve. \"We thank you for\ngiving us the means of happiness; we shall always feel grateful to\nyou.\"\n\n\"Great heavens! don't call down blessings on _me_!\" cried Petit-Claud.\n\"It fills me with remorse; but to-day, I think, I have made full\nreparation. If I am a magistrate, it is entirely owing to you; and if\nanybody is to feel grateful, it is I. Good-bye.\"\n\n\n\nAs time went on, Kolb changed his opinion of Sechard senior; and as\nfor the old man, he took a liking to Kolb when he found that, like\nhimself, the Alsacien could neither write nor read a word, and that it\nwas easy to make him tipsy. The old \"bear\" imparted his ideas on vine\nculture and the sale of a vintage to the ex-cuirassier, and trained\nhim with a view to leaving a man with a head on his shoulders to look\nafter his children when he should be gone; for he grew childish at the\nlast, and great were his fears as to the fate of his property. He had\nchosen Courtois the miller as his confidant. \"You will see how things\nwill go with my children when I am under ground. Lord! it makes me\nshudder to think of it.\"\n\nOld Sechard died in the month of March, 1929, leaving about two\nhundred thousand francs in land. His acres added to the Verberie made\na fine property, which Kolb had managed to admiration for some two\nyears.\n\nDavid and his wife found nearly a hundred thousand crowns in gold in\nthe house. The department of the Charente had valued old Sechard's\nmoney at a million; rumor, as usual, exaggerating the amount of a\nhoard. Eve and David had barely thirty thousand francs of income when\nthey added their little fortune to the inheritance; they waited\nawhile, and so it fell out that they invested their capital in\nGovernment securities at the time of the Revolution of July.\n\nThen, and not until then, could the department of the Charente and\nDavid Sechard form some idea of the wealth of the tall Cointet. Rich\nto the extent of several millions of francs, the elder Cointet became\na deputy, and is at this day a peer of France. It is said that he will\nbe Minister of Commerce in the next Government; for in 1842 he married\nMlle. Popinot, daughter of M. Anselme Popinot, one of the most\ninfluential statesmen of the dynasty, deputy and mayor of an\narrondissement in Paris.\n\nDavid Sechard's discovery has been assimilated by the French\nmanufacturing world, as food is assimilated by a living body. Thanks\nto the introduction of materials other than rags, France can produce\npaper more cheaply than any other European country. Dutch paper, as\nDavid foresaw, no longer exists. Sooner or later it will be necessary,\nno doubt, to establish a Royal Paper Manufactory; like the Gobelins,\nthe Sevres porcelain works, the Savonnerie, and the Imprimerie royale,\nwhich so far have escaped the destruction threatened by _bourgeois_\nvandalism.\n\nDavid Sechard, beloved by his wife, father of two boys and a girl, has\nthe good taste to make no allusion to his past efforts. Eve had the\nsense to dissuade him from following his terrible vocation; for the\ninventor like Moses on Mount Horeb, is consumed by the burning bush.\nHe cultivates literature by way of recreation, and leads a comfortable\nlife of leisure, befitting the landowner who lives on his own estate.\nHe has bidden farewell for ever to glory, and bravely taken his place\nin the class of dreamers and collectors; for he dabbles in entomology,\nand is at present investigating the transformations of insects which\nscience only knows in the final stage.\n\nEverybody has heard of Petit-Claud's success as attorney-general; he\nis the rival of the great Vinet of Provins, and it is his ambition to\nbe President of the Court-Royal of Poitiers.\n\nCerizet has been in trouble so frequently for political offences that\nhe has been a good deal talked about; and as one of the boldest\n_enfants perdus_ of the Liberal party he was nicknamed the \"Brave\nCerizet.\" When Petit-Claud's successor compelled him to sell his\nbusiness in Angouleme, he found a fresh career on the provincial\nstage, where his talents as an actor were like to be turned to\nbrilliant account. The chief stage heroine, however, obliged him to go\nto Paris to find a cure for love among the resources of science, and\nthere he tried to curry favor with the Liberal party.\n\nAs for Lucien, the story of his return to Paris belongs to the _Scenes\nof Parisian_ life.\n\n\n\n                               ADDENDUM\n\nThe following personages appear in other stories of the Human Comedy.\n\nCerizet\n  Two Poets\n  A Man of Business\n  Scenes from a Courtesan's Life\n  The Middle Classes\n\nChardon, Madame (nee Rubempre)\n  Two Poets\n  Scenes from a Courtesan's Life\n\nChatelet, Sixte, Baron du\n  Two Poets\n  A Distinguished Provincial at Paris\n  Scenes from a Courtesan's Life\n  The Thirteen\n\nChatelet, Marie-Louise-Anais de Negrepelisse, Baronne du\n  Two Poets\n  A Distinguished Provincial at Paris\n  The Government Clerks\n\nCointet, Boniface\n  Two Poets\n  The Firm of Nucingen\n  The Member for Arcis\n\nCointet, Jean\n  Two Poets\n\nCollin, Jacques\n  Father Goriot\n  A Distinguished Provincial at Paris\n  Scenes from a Courtesan's Life\n  The Member for Arcis\n\nConti, Gennaro\n  Beatrix\n\nCourtois\n  Two Poets\n\nCourtois, Madame\n  Two Poets\n\nHautoy, Francis du\n  Two Poets\n\nHerrera, Carlos\n  Scenes from a Courtesan's Life\n\nMarron\n  Scenes from a Courtesan's Life\n\nMarsay, Henri de\n  The Thirteen\n  The Unconscious Humorists\n  Another Study of Woman\n  The Lily of the Valley\n  Father Goriot\n  Jealousies of a Country Town\n  Ursule Mirouet\n  A Marriage Settlement\n  A Distinguished Provincial at Paris\n  Letters of Two Brides\n  The Ball at Sceaux\n  Modeste Mignon\n  The Secrets of a Princess\n  The Gondreville Mystery\n  A Daughter of Eve\n\nMetivier\n  The Government Clerks\n  The Middle Classes\n\nMilaud\n  The Muse of the Department\n\nNucingen, Baron Frederic de\n  The Firm of Nucingen\n  Father Goriot\n  Pierrette\n  Cesar Birotteau\n  A Distinguished Provincial at Paris\n  Scenes from a Courtesan's Life\n  Another Study of Woman\n  The Secrets of a Princess\n  A Man of Business\n  Cousin Betty\n  The Muse of the Department\n  The Unconscious Humorists\n\nNucingen, Baronne Delphine de\n  Father Goriot\n  The Thirteen\n  Eugenie Grandet\n  Cesar Birotteau\n  Melmoth Reconciled\n  A Distinguished Provincial at Paris\n  The Commission in Lunacy\n  Scenes from a Courtesan's Life\n  Modeste Mignon\n  The Firm of Nucingen\n  Another Study of Woman\n  A Daughter of Eve\n  The Member for Arcis\n\nPetit-Claud\n  Two Poets\n\nPimentel, Marquis and Marquise de\n  Two Poets\n\nPostel\n  Two Poets\n\nPrieur, Madame\n  Two Poets\n\nRastignac, Baron and Baronne de (Eugene's parents)\n  Father Goriot\n  Two Poets\n\nRastignac, Eugene de\n  Father Goriot\n  A Distinguished Provincial at Paris\n  Scenes from a Courtesan's Life\n  The Ball at Sceaux\n  The Commission in Lunacy\n  A Study of Woman\n  Another Study of Woman\n  The Magic Skin\n  The Secrets of a Princess\n  A Daughter of Eve\n  The Gondreville Mystery\n  The Firm of Nucingen\n  Cousin Betty\n  The Member for Arcis\n  The Unconscious Humorists\n\nRubempre, Lucien-Chardon de\n  Two Poets\n  A Distinguished Provincial at Paris\n  The Government Clerks\n  Ursule Mirouet\n  Scenes from a Courtesan's Life\n\nSechard, Jerome-Nicholas\n  Two Poets\n\nSechard, David\n  Two Poets\n  A Distinguished Provincial At Paris\n  Scenes from a Courtesan's Life\n\nSechard, Madame David\n  Two Poets\n  A Distinguished Provincial At Paris\n  Scenes from a Courtesan's Life\n\nSenonches, Jacques de\n  Two Poets\n\nSenonches, Madame Jacques de\n  Two Poets\n\nTouches, Mademoiselle Felicite des\n  Beatrix\n  A Distinguished Provincial at Paris\n  A Bachelor's Establishment\n  Another Study of Woman\n  A Daughter of Eve\n  Honorine\n  Beatrix\n  The Muse of the Department\n\nVictorine\n  Massimilla Doni\n  Letters of Two Brides\n  Gaudissart II\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Lost Illusions, by Honore De Balzac\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK LOST ILLUSIONS ***\n\n***** This file should be named 13159.txt or 13159.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\/1\/3\/1\/5\/13159\/\n\nProduced by Dagny\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp:\/\/pglaf.org\/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\ninformation can be found at the Foundation's web site and official\npage at http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":405,"split":"train"}
