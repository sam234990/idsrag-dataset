Pierre is engaged to the blonde Lucy Tartan in a match approved by his domineering mother, who controls the estate since the death of his father, Pierre, senior. When he encounters, however, the dark and mysterious Isabel Banford, he hears from her the claim that she is his half-sister, the illegitimate and orphaned child of his father and a European refugee. Pierre reacts to the story (and to his magnetic attraction for Isabel) by devising a remarkable scheme to preserve his father\u2019s name, spare his mother\u2019s grief, and give Isabel her proper share of the estate.\nHe announces to his mother that he is married; she promptly throws him out of the house. He and Isabel then depart for New York City, accompanied by a disgraced young woman, Delly Ulver. During their stagecoach journey, Pierre finds and reads a fragment of a treatise on \"Chronometricals and Horologicals\" on the differences between absolute and relative virtue by one Plotinus Plinlimmon. In the city, Pierre counts on the hospitality of his friend and cousin Glendinning Stanley, but is surprised when Glen refuses to recognize him. The trio (Pierre, Isabel, and Delly) find rooms in a former church converted to apartments, the Church of the Apostles, now populated by impecunious artists, writers, spiritualists, and philosophers, including the mysterious Plinlimmon. Pierre attempts to earn money by writing a book, encouraged by his juvenile successes as a writer.\nHe learns that his mother has died and has left the Saddle Meadows estate to Glen Stanley, who is now engaged to marry Lucy Tartan. Suddenly, however, Lucy shows up at the Apostles, determined to share Pierre\u2019s life and lot, despite his apparent marriage to Isabel. Pierre and the three women live there together as best they can, while their scant money runs out. Pierre\u2019s writing does not go well \u2014 having been \"Timonized\" by his experiences, the darker truths he has come to recognize cannot be reconciled with the light and innocent literature the market seeks. Unable to write, he has a vision in a trance of an earth-bound stone giant Enceladus and his assault on the heavenly Mount of Titans. Beset by debts, by fears of the threats of Glen Stanley and Lucy\u2019s brother, by the rejection of his book by its contracted publishers, by fears of his own incestuous passion for Isabel, and finally by doubts of the truth of Isabel\u2019s story, Pierre guns down Glen Stanley at rush hour on Broadway, and is taken to jail in The Tombs. There Isabel and Lucy visit him, and Lucy dies of shock when Isabel addresses Pierre as her brother. Pierre then seizes upon the secret poison vial that Isabel carries and drinks it, and Isabel finishes the remainder, leaving three corpses as the novel ends.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of Pierre; or The Ambiguities, by Herman Melville\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

Not a flower stirs; the trees forget to wave; the grass\nitself seems to have ceased to grow; and all Nature, as if suddenly\nbecome conscious of her own profound mystery, and feeling no refuge from\nit but silence, sinks into this wonderful and indescribable repose.\n\nSuch was the morning in June, when, issuing from the embowered and\nhigh-gabled old home of his fathers, Pierre, dewily refreshed and\nspiritualized by sleep, gayly entered the long, wide, elm-arched street\nof the village, and half unconsciously bent his steps toward a cottage,\nwhich peeped into view near the end of the vista.\n\nThe verdant trance lay far and wide; and through it nothing came but the\nbrindled kine, dreamily wandering to their pastures, followed, not\ndriven, by ruddy-cheeked, white-footed boys.\n\nAs touched and bewitched by the loveliness of this silence, Pierre\nneared the cottage, and lifted his eyes, he swiftly paused, fixing his\nglance upon one upper, open casement there. Why now this impassioned,\nyouthful pause? Why this enkindled cheek and eye? Upon the sill of the\ncasement, a snow-white glossy pillow reposes, and a trailing shrub has\nsoftly rested a rich, crimson flower against it.\n\nWell mayst thou seek that pillow, thou odoriferous flower, thought\nPierre; not an hour ago, her own cheek must have rested there. \"Lucy!\"\n\n\"Pierre!\"\n\nAs heart rings to heart those voices rang, and for a moment, in the\nbright hush of the morning, the two stood silently but ardently eying\neach other, beholding mutual reflections of a boundless admiration and\nlove.\n\n\"Nothing but Pierre,\" laughed the youth, at last; \"thou hast forgotten\nto bid me good-morning.\"\n\n\"That would be little. Good-mornings, good-evenings, good days, weeks,\nmonths, and years to thee, Pierre;--bright Pierre!--Pierre!\"\n\nTruly, thought the youth, with a still gaze of inexpressible fondness;\ntruly the skies do ope, and this invoking angel looks down.--\"I would\nreturn thee thy manifold good-mornings, Lucy, did not that presume thou\nhad'st lived through a night; and by Heaven, thou belong'st to the\nregions of an infinite day!\"\n\n\"Fie, now, Pierre; why should ye youths always swear when ye love!\"\n\n\"Because in us love is profane, since it mortally reaches toward the\nheaven in ye!\"\n\n\"There thou fly'st again, Pierre; thou art always circumventing me so.\nTell me, why should ye youths ever show so sweet an expertness in\nturning all trifles of ours into trophies of yours?\"\n\n\"I know not how that is, but ever was it our fashion to do.\" And shaking\nthe casement shrub, he dislodged the flower, and conspicuously fastened\nit in his bosom.--\"I must away now, Lucy; see! under these colors I\nmarch.\"\n\n\"Bravissimo! oh, my only recruit!\"\n\n\nII.\n\nPierre was the only son of an affluent, and haughty widow; a lady who\nexternally furnished a singular example of the preservative and\nbeautifying influences of unfluctuating rank, health, and wealth, when\njoined to a fine mind of medium culture, uncankered by any inconsolable\ngrief, and never worn by sordid cares. In mature age, the rose still\nmiraculously clung to her cheek; litheness had not yet completely\nuncoiled itself from her waist, nor smoothness unscrolled itself from\nher brow, nor diamondness departed from her eyes. So that when lit up\nand bediademed by ball-room lights, Mrs. Glendinning still eclipsed far\nyounger charms, and had she chosen to encourage them, would have been\nfollowed by a train of infatuated suitors, little less young than her\nown son Pierre.\n\nBut a reverential and devoted son seemed lover enough for this widow\nBloom; and besides all this, Pierre when namelessly annoyed, and\nsometimes even jealously transported by the too ardent admiration of the\nhandsome youths, who now and then, caught in unintended snares, seemed\nto entertain some insane hopes of wedding this unattainable being;\nPierre had more than once, with a playful malice, openly sworn, that the\nman--gray-beard, or beardless--who should dare to propose marriage to\nhis mother, that man would by some peremptory unrevealed agency\nimmediately disappear from the earth.\n\nThis romantic filial love of Pierre seemed fully returned by the\ntriumphant maternal pride of the widow, who in the clear-cut lineaments\nand noble air of the son, saw her own graces strangely translated into\nthe opposite sex. There was a striking personal resemblance between\nthem; and as the mother seemed to have long stood still in her beauty,\nheedless of the passing years; so Pierre seemed to meet her half-way,\nand by a splendid precocity of form and feature, almost advanced himself\nto that mature stand-point in Time, where his pedestaled mother so long\nhad stood. In the playfulness of their unclouded love, and with that\nstrange license which a perfect confidence and mutual understanding at\nall points, had long bred between them, they were wont to call each\nother brother and sister. Both in public and private this was their\nusage; nor when thrown among strangers, was this mode of address ever\nsuspected for a sportful assumption; since the amaranthiness of Mrs.\nGlendinning fully sustained this youthful pretension.--Thus freely and\nlightsomely for mother and son flowed on the pure joined current of\nlife. But as yet the fair river had not borne its waves to those\nsideways repelling rocks, where it was thenceforth destined to be\nforever divided into two unmixing streams.\n\nAn excellent English author of these times enumerating the prime\nadvantages of his natal lot, cites foremost, that he first saw the rural\nlight. So with Pierre. It had been his choice fate to have been born and\nnurtured in the country, surrounded by scenery whose uncommon loveliness\nwas the perfect mould of a delicate and poetic mind; while the popular\nnames of its finest features appealed to the proudest patriotic and\nfamily associations of the historic line of Glendinning. On the meadows\nwhich sloped away from the shaded rear of the manorial mansion, far to\nthe winding river, an Indian battle had been fought, in the earlier days\nof the colony, and in that battle the paternal great-grandfather of\nPierre, mortally wounded, had sat unhorsed on his saddle in the grass,\nwith his dying voice, still cheering his men in the fray. This was\nSaddle-Meadows, a name likewise extended to the mansion and the\nvillage. Far beyond these plains, a day's walk for Pierre, rose the\nstoried heights, where in the Revolutionary War his grandfather had for\nseveral months defended a rude but all-important stockaded fort, against\nthe repeated combined assaults of Indians, Tories, and Regulars. From\nbefore that fort, the gentlemanly, but murderous half-breed, Brandt, had\nfled, but had survived to dine with General Glendinning, in the amicable\ntimes which followed that vindictive war. All the associations of\nSaddle-Meadows were full of pride to Pierre. The Glendinning deeds by\nwhich their estate had so long been held, bore the cyphers of three\nIndian kings, the aboriginal and only conveyancers of those noble woods\nand plains. Thus loftily, in the days of his circumscribed youth, did\nPierre glance along the background of his race; little recking of that\nmaturer and larger interior development, which should forever deprive\nthese things of their full power of pride in his soul.\n\nBut the breeding of Pierre would have been unwisely contracted, had his\nyouth been unintermittingly passed in these rural scenes. At a very\nearly period he had begun to accompany his father and mother--and\nafterwards his mother alone--in their annual visits to the city; where\nnaturally mingling in a large and polished society, Pierre had\ninsensibly formed himself in the airier graces of life, without\nenfeebling the vigor derived from a martial race, and fostered in the\ncountry's clarion air.\n\nNor while thus liberally developed in person and manners, was Pierre\ndeficient in a still better and finer culture. Not in vain had he spent\nlong summer afternoons in the deep recesses of his father's fastidiously\npicked and decorous library; where the Spenserian nymphs had early led\nhim into many a maze of all-bewildering beauty. Thus, with a graceful\nglow on his limbs, and soft, imaginative flames in his heart, did this\nPierre glide toward maturity, thoughtless of that period of remorseless\ninsight, when all these delicate warmths should seem frigid to him, and\nhe should madly demand more ardent fires.\n\nNor had that pride and love which had so bountifully provided for the\nyouthful nurture of Pierre, neglected his culture in the deepest element\nof all. It had been a maxim with the father of Pierre, that all\ngentlemanhood was vain; all claims to it preposterous and absurd, unless\nthe primeval gentleness and golden humanities of religion had been so\nthoroughly wrought into the complete texture of the character, that he\nwho pronounced himself gentleman, could also rightfully assume the meek,\nbut kingly style of Christian. At the age of sixteen, Pierre partook\nwith his mother of the Holy Sacraments.\n\nIt were needless, and more difficult, perhaps, to trace out precisely\nthe absolute motives which prompted these youthful vows. Enough, that as\nto Pierre had descended the numerous other noble qualities of his\nancestors; and as he now stood heir to their forests and farms; so by\nthe same insensible sliding process, he seemed to have inherited their\ndocile homage to a venerable Faith, which the first Glendinning had\nbrought over sea, from beneath the shadow of an English minister. Thus\nin Pierre was the complete polished steel of the gentleman, girded with\nReligion's silken sash; and his great-grandfather's soldierly fate had\ntaught him that the generous sash should, in the last bitter trial,\nfurnish its wearer with Glory's shroud; so that what through life had\nbeen worn for Grace's sake, in death might safely hold the man. But\nwhile thus all alive to the beauty and poesy of his father's faith,\nPierre little foresaw that this world hath a secret deeper than beauty,\nand Life some burdens heavier than death.\n\nSo perfect to Pierre had long seemed the illuminated scroll of his life\nthus far, that only one hiatus was discoverable by him in that\nsweetly-writ manuscript. A sister had been omitted from the text. He\nmourned that so delicious a feeling as fraternal love had been denied\nhim. Nor could the fictitious title, which he so often lavished upon his\nmother, at all supply the absent reality. This emotion was most natural;\nand the full cause and reason of it even Pierre did not at that time\nentirely appreciate. For surely a gentle sister is the second best gift\nto a man; and it is first in point of occurrence; for the wife comes\nafter. He who is sisterless, is as a bachelor before his time. For much\nthat goes to make up the deliciousness of a wife, already lies in the\nsister.\n\n\"Oh, had my father but had a daughter!\" cried Pierre; \"some one whom I\nmight love, and protect, and fight for, if need be. It must be a\nglorious thing to engage in a mortal quarrel on a sweet sister's behalf!\nNow, of all things, would to heaven, I had a sister!\"\n\nThus, ere entranced in the gentler bonds of a lover; thus often would\nPierre invoke heaven for a sister; but Pierre did not then know, that if\nthere be any thing a man might well pray against, that thing is the\nresponsive gratification of some of the devoutest prayers of his youth.\n\nIt may have been that this strange yearning of Pierre for a sister, had\npart of its origin in that still stranger feeling of loneliness he\nsometimes experienced, as not only the solitary head of his family, but\nthe only surnamed male Glendinning extant. A powerful and populous\nfamily had by degrees run off into the female branches; so that Pierre\nfound himself surrounded by numerous kinsmen and kinswomen, yet\ncompanioned by no surnamed male Glendinning, but the duplicate one\nreflected to him in the mirror. But in his more wonted natural mood,\nthis thought was not wholly sad to him. Nay, sometimes it mounted into\nan exultant swell. For in the ruddiness, and flushfulness, and\nvain-gloriousness of his youthful soul, he fondly hoped to have a\nmonopoly of glory in capping the fame-column, whose tall shaft had been\nerected by his noble sires.\n\nIn all this, how unadmonished was our Pierre by that foreboding and\nprophetic lesson taught, not less by Palmyra's quarries, than by\nPalmyra's ruins. Among those ruins is a crumbling, uncompleted shaft,\nand some leagues off, ages ago left in the quarry, is the crumbling\ncorresponding capital, also incomplete. These Time seized and spoiled;\nthese Time crushed in the egg; and the proud stone that should have\nstood among the clouds, Time left abased beneath the soil. Oh, what\nquenchless feud is this, that Time hath with the sons of Men!\n\n\nIII.\n\nIt has been said that the beautiful country round about Pierre appealed\nto very proud memories. But not only through the mere chances of things,\nhad that fine country become ennobled by the deeds of his sires, but in\nPierre's eyes, all its hills and swales seemed as sanctified through\ntheir very long uninterrupted possession by his race.\n\nThat fond ideality which, in the eyes of affection, hallows the least\ntrinket once familiar to the person of a departed love; with Pierre that\ntalisman touched the whole earthly landscape about him; for remembering\nthat on those hills his own fine fathers had gazed; through those woods,\nover these lawns, by that stream, along these tangled paths, many a\ngrand-dame of his had merrily strolled when a girl; vividly recalling\nthese things, Pierre deemed all that part of the earth a love-token; so\nthat his very horizon was to him as a memorial ring.\n\nThe monarchical world very generally imagines, that in demagoguical\nAmerica the sacred Past hath no fixed statues erected to it, but all\nthings irreverently seethe and boil in the vulgar caldron of an\neverlasting uncrystalizing Present. This conceit would seem peculiarly\napplicable to the social condition. With no chartered aristocracy, and\nno law of entail, how can any family in America imposingly perpetuate\nitself? Certainly that common saying among us, which declares, that be a\nfamily conspicuous as it may, a single half-century shall see it abased;\nthat maxim undoubtedly holds true with the commonalty. In our cities\nfamilies rise and burst like bubbles in a vat. For indeed the democratic\nelement operates as a subtile acid among us; forever producing new\nthings by corroding the old; as in the south of France verdigris, the\nprimitive material of one kind of green paint, is produced by\ngrape-vinegar poured upon copper plates. Now in general nothing can be\nmore significant of decay than the idea of corrosion; yet on the other\nhand, nothing can more vividly suggest luxuriance of life, than the idea\nof green as a color; for green is the peculiar signet of all-fertile\nNature herself. Herein by apt analogy we behold the marked anomalousness\nof America; whose character abroad, we need not be surprised, is\nmisconceived, when we consider how strangely she contradicts all prior\nnotions of human things; and how wonderfully to her, Death itself\nbecomes transmuted into Life. So that political institutions, which in\nother lands seem above all things intensely artificial, with America\nseem to possess the divine virtue of a natural law; for the most mighty\nof nature's laws is this, that out of Death she brings Life.\n\nStill, are there things in the visible world, over which ever-shifting\nNature hath not so unbounded a sway. The grass is annually changed; but\nthe limbs of the oak, for a long term of years, defy that annual decree.\nAnd if in America the vast mass of families be as the blades of grass,\nyet some few there are that stand as the oak; which, instead of\ndecaying, annually puts forth new branches; whereby Time, instead of\nsubtracting, is made to capitulate into a multiple virtue.\n\nIn this matter we will--not superciliously, but in fair spirit--compare\npedigrees with England, and strange as it may seem at the first blush,\nnot without some claim to equality. I dare say, that in this thing the\nPeerage Book is a good statistical standard whereby to judge her; since\nthe compilers of that work can not be entirely insensible on whose\npatronage they most rely; and the common intelligence of our own people\nshall suffice to judge us. But the magnificence of names must not\nmislead us as to the humility of things. For as the breath in all our\nlungs is hereditary, and my present breath at this moment, is further\ndescended than the body of the present High Priest of the Jews, so far\nas he can assuredly trace it; so mere names, which are also but air, do\nlikewise revel in this endless descendedness. But if Richmond, and St.\nAlbans, and Grafton, and Portland, and Buccleugh, be names almost old as\nEngland herself, the present Dukes of those names stop in their own\ngenuine pedigrees at Charles II., and there find no very fine fountain;\nsince what we would deem the least glorious parentage under the sun, is\nprecisely the parentage of a Buccleugh, for example; whose ancestress\ncould not well avoid being a mother, it is true, but had accidentally\nomitted the preliminary rite. Yet a king was the sire. Then only so much\nthe worse; for if it be small insult to be struck by a pauper, but\nmortal offense to receive a blow from a gentleman, then of all things\nthe bye-blows of kings must be signally unflattering. In England the\nPeerage is kept alive by incessant restorations and creations. One man,\nGeorge III., manufactured five hundred and twenty-two peers. An earldom,\nin abeyance for five centuries, has suddenly been assumed by some\ncommoner, to whom it had not so much descended, as through the art of\nthe lawyers been made flexibly to bend in that direction. For not Thames\nis so sinuous in his natural course, not the Bridgewater Canal more\nartificially conducted, than blood in the veins of that winding or\nmanufactured nobility. Perishable as stubble, and fungous as the fungi,\nthose grafted families successively live and die on the eternal soil of\na name. In England this day, twenty-five hundred peerages are extinct;\nbut the names survive. So that the empty air of a name is more\nendurable than a man, or than dynasties of men; the air fills man's\nlungs and puts life into a man, but man fills not the air, nor puts life\ninto that.\n\nAll honor to the names then, and all courtesy to the men; but if St.\nAlbans tell me he is all-honorable and all-eternal, I must still\npolitely refer him to Nell Gwynne.\n\nBeyond Charles II. very few indeed--hardly worthy of note--are the\npresent titled English families which can trace any thing like a direct\nunvitiated blood-descent from the thief knights of the Norman. Beyond\nCharles II. their direct genealogies seem vain as though some Jew\nclothesman, with a tea-canister on his head, turned over the first\nchapter of St. Matthew to make out his unmingled participation in the\nblood of King Saul, who had long died ere the career of the C\u00c3\u00a6sar began.\n\nNow, not preliminarily to enlarge upon the fact that, while in England\nan immense mass of state-masonry is brought to bear as a buttress in\nupholding the hereditary existence of certain houses, while with us\nnothing of that kind can possibly be admitted; and to omit all mention\nof the hundreds of unobtrusive families in New England who,\nnevertheless, might easily trace their uninterrupted English lineage to\na time before Charles the Blade: not to speak of the old and\noriental-like English planter families of Virginia and the South; the\nRandolphs for example, one of whose ancestors, in King James' time,\nmarried Pocahontas the Indian Princess, and in whose blood therefore an\nunderived aboriginal royalty was flowing over two hundred years ago;\nconsider those most ancient and magnificent Dutch Manors at the North,\nwhose perches are miles--whose meadows overspread adjacent\ncountries--and whose haughty rent-deeds are held by their thousand\nfarmer tenants, so long as grass grows and water runs; which hints of a\nsurprising eternity for a deed, and seem to make lawyer's ink\nunobliterable as the sea. Some of those manors are two centuries old;\nand their present patrons or lords will show you stakes and stones on\ntheir estates put there--the stones at least--before Nell Gwynne the\nDuke-mother was born, and genealogies which, like their own river,\nHudson, flow somewhat farther and straighter than the Serpentine\nbrooklet in Hyde Park.\n\nThese far-descended Dutch meadows lie steeped in a Hindooish haze; an\neastern patriarchalness sways its mild crook over pastures, whose tenant\nflocks shall there feed, long as their own grass grows, long as their\nown water shall run. Such estates seem to defy Time's tooth, and by\nconditions which take hold of the indestructible earth seem to\ncontemporize their fee-simples with eternity. Unimaginable audacity of a\nworm that but crawls through the soil he so imperially claims!\n\nIn midland counties of England they boast of old oaken dining-halls\nwhere three hundred men-at-arms could exercise of a rainy afternoon, in\nthe reign of the Plantagenets. But our lords, the Patroons, appeal not\nto the past, but they point to the present. One will show you that the\npublic census of a county is but part of the roll of his tenants. Ranges\nof mountains, high as Ben Nevis or Snowdon, are their walls; and regular\narmies, with staffs of officers, crossing rivers with artillery, and\nmarching through primeval woods, and threading vast rocky defiles, have\nbeen sent out to distrain upon three thousand farmer-tenants of one\nlandlord, at a blow. A fact most suggestive two ways; both whereof shall\nbe nameless here.\n\nBut whatever one may think of the existence of such mighty lordships in\nthe heart of a republic, and however we may wonder at their thus\nsurviving, like Indian mounds, the Revolutionary flood; yet survive and\nexist they do, and are now owned by their present proprietors, by as\ngood nominal title as any peasant owns his father's old hat, or any duke\nhis great-uncle's old coronet.\n\nFor all this, then, we shall not err very widely if we humbly conceive,\nthat--should she choose to glorify herself in that inconsiderable\nway--our America will make out a good general case with England in this\nshort little matter of large estates, and long pedigrees--pedigrees I\nmean, wherein is no flaw.\n\n\nIV.\n\nIn general terms we have been thus decided in asserting the great\ngenealogical and real-estate dignity of some families in America,\nbecause in so doing we poetically establish the richly aristocratic\ncondition of Master Pierre Glendinning, for whom we have before claimed\nsome special family distinction. And to the observant reader the sequel\nwill not fail to show, how important is this circumstance, considered\nwith reference to the singularly developed character and most singular\nlife-career of our hero. Nor will any man dream that the last chapter\nwas merely intended for a foolish bravado, and not with a solid purpose\nin view.\n\nNow Pierre stands on this noble pedestal; we shall see if he keeps that\nfine footing; we shall see if Fate hath not just a little bit of a small\nword or two to say in this world. But it is not laid down here that the\nGlendinnings dated back beyond Pharaoh, or the deeds of Saddle-Meadows\nto the Three Magi in the Gospels. Nevertheless, those deeds, as before\nhinted, did indeed date back to three kings--Indian kings--only so much\nthe finer for that.\n\nBut if Pierre did not date back to the Pharaohs, and if the English\nfarmer Hampdens were somewhat the seniors of even the oldest\nGlendinning; and if some American manors boasted a few additional years\nand square miles over his, yet think you that it is at all possible,\nthat a youth of nineteen should--merely by way of trial of the\nthing--strew his ancestral kitchen hearth-stone with wheat in the stalk,\nand there standing in the chimney thresh out that grain with a flail,\nwhose aerial evolutions had free play among all that masonry; were it\nnot impossible for such a flailer so to thresh wheat in his own\nancestral kitchen chimney without feeling just a little twinge or two of\nwhat one might call family pride? I should say not.\n\nOr how think you it would be with this youthful Pierre, if every day\ndescending to breakfast, he caught sight of an old tattered British\nbanner or two, hanging over an arched window in his hall; and those\nbanners captured by his grandfather, the general, in fair fight? Or how\nthink you it would be if every time he heard the band of the military\ncompany of the village, he should distinctly recognize the peculiar tap\nof a British kettle-drum also captured by his grandfather in fair fight,\nand afterwards suitably inscribed on the brass and bestowed upon the\nSaddle-Meadows Artillery Corps? Or how think you it would be, if\nsometimes of a mild meditative Fourth of July morning in the country, he\ncarried out with him into the garden by way of ceremonial cane, a long,\nmajestic, silver-tipped staff, a Major-General's baton, once wielded on\nthe plume-nodding and musket-flashing review by the same grandfather\nseveral times here-in-before mentioned? I should say that considering\nPierre was quite young and very unphilosophical as yet, and withal\nrather high-blooded; and sometimes read the History of the Revolutionary\nWar, and possessed a mother who very frequently made remote social\nallusions to the epaulettes of the Major-General his grandfather;--I\nshould say that upon all of these occasions, the way it must have been\nwith him, was a very proud, elated sort of way. And if this seem but too\nfond and foolish in Pierre; and if you tell me that this sort of thing\nin him showed him no sterling Democrat, and that a truly noble man\nshould never brag of any arm but his own; then I beg you to consider\nagain that this Pierre was but a youngster as yet. And believe me you\nwill pronounce Pierre a thoroughgoing Democrat in time; perhaps a little\ntoo Radical altogether to your fancy.\n\nIn conclusion, do not blame me if I here make repetition, and do\nverbally quote my own words in saying that _it had been the choice fate\nof Pierre to have been born and bred in the country_. For to a noble\nAmerican youth this indeed--more than in any other land--this indeed is\na most rare and choice lot. For it is to be observed, that while in\nother countries, the finest families boast of the country as their home;\nthe more prominent among us, proudly cite the city as their seat. Too\noften the American that himself makes his fortune, builds him a great\nmetropolitan house, in the most metropolitan street of the most\nmetropolitan town. Whereas a European of the same sort would thereupon\nmigrate into the country. That herein the European hath the better of\nit, no poet, no philosopher, and no aristocrat will deny. For the\ncountry is not only the most poetical and philosophical, but it is the\nmost aristocratic part of this earth, for it is the most venerable, and\nnumerous bards have ennobled it by many fine titles. Whereas the town is\nthe more plebeian portion: which, besides many other things, is plainly\nevinced by the dirty unwashed face perpetually worn by the town; but the\ncountry, like any Queen, is ever attended by scrupulous lady's maids in\nthe guise of the seasons, and the town hath but one dress of brick\nturned up with stone; but the country hath a brave dress for every week\nin the year; sometimes she changes her dress twenty-four times in the\ntwenty-four hours; and the country weareth her sun by day as a diamond\non a Queen's brow; and the stars by night as necklaces of gold beads;\nwhereas the town's sun is smoky paste, and no diamond, and the town's\nstars are pinchbeck and not gold.\n\nIn the country then Nature planted our Pierre; because Nature intended a\nrare and original development in Pierre. Never mind if hereby she proved\nambiguous to him in the end; nevertheless, in the beginning she did\nbravely. She blew her wind-clarion from the blue hills, and Pierre\nneighed out lyrical thoughts, as at the trumpet-blast, a war-horse paws\nhimself into a lyric of foam. She whispered through her deep groves at\neve, and gentle whispers of humanness, and sweet whispers of love, ran\nthrough Pierre's thought-veins, musical as water over pebbles. She\nlifted her spangled crest of a thickly-starred night, and forth at that\nglimpse of their divine Captain and Lord, ten thousand mailed thoughts\nof heroicness started up in Pierre's soul, and glared round for some\ninsulted good cause to defend.\n\nSo the country was a glorious benediction to young Pierre; we shall see\nif that blessing pass from him as did the divine blessing from the\nHebrews; we shall yet see again, I say, whether Fate hath not just a\nlittle bit of a word or two to say in this world; we shall see whether\nthis wee little bit scrap of latinity be very far out of the way--_Nemo\ncontra Deum nisi Deus ipse._\n\n\nV.\n\n\"Sister Mary,\" said Pierre, returned from his sunrise stroll, and\ntapping at his mother's chamber door:--\"do you know, sister Mary, that\nthe trees which have been up all night, are all abroad again this\nmorning before you?--Do you not smell something like coffee, my sister?\"\n\nA light step moved from within toward the door; which opened, showing\nMrs. Glendinning, in a resplendently cheerful morning robe, and holding\na gay wide ribbon in her hand.\n\n\"Good morning, madam,\" said Pierre, slowly, and with a bow, whose\ngenuine and spontaneous reverence amusingly contrasted with the sportive\nmanner that had preceded it. For thus sweetly and religiously was the\nfamiliarity of his affections bottomed on the profoundest filial\nrespect.\n\n\"Good afternoon to you, Pierre, for I suppose it is afternoon. But come,\nyou shall finish my toilette;--here, brother--\" reaching the\nribbon--\"now acquit yourself bravely--\" and seating herself away from\nthe glass, she awaited the good offices of Pierre.\n\n\"First Lady in waiting to the Dowager Duchess Glendinning,\" laughed\nPierre, as bowing over before his mother, he gracefully passed the\nribbon round her neck, simply crossing the ends in front.\n\n\"Well, what is to hold it there, Pierre?\"\n\n\"I am going to try and tack it with a kiss, sister,--there!--oh, what a\npity that sort of fastening won't always hold!--where's the cameo with\nthe fawns, I gave you last night?--Ah! on the slab--you were going to\nwear it then?--Thank you, my considerate and most politic\nsister--there!--but stop--here's a ringlet gone romping--so now, dear\nsister, give that Assyrian toss to your head.\"\n\nThe haughtily happy mother rose to her feet, and as she stood before the\nmirror to criticize her son's adornings, Pierre, noticing the straggling\ntie of her slipper, knelt down and secured it. \"And now for the urn,\" he\ncried, \"madam!\" and with a humorous gallantry, offering his arm to his\nmother, the pair descended to breakfast.\n\nWith Mrs. Glendinning it was one of those spontaneous maxims, which\nwomen sometimes act upon without ever thinking of, never to appear in\nthe presence of her son in any dishabille that was not eminently\nbecoming. Her own independent observation of things, had revealed to her\nmany very common maxims, which often become operatively lifeless from a\nvicarious reception of them. She was vividly aware how immense was that\ninfluence, which, even in the closest ties of the heart, the merest\nappearances make upon the mind. And as in the admiring love and\ngraceful devotion of Pierre lay now her highest joy in life; so she\nomitted no slightest trifle which could possibly contribute to the\npreservation of so sweet and flattering a thing.\n\nBesides all this, Mary Glendinning was a woman, and with more than the\nordinary vanity of women--if vanity it can be called--which in a life of\nnearly fifty years had never betrayed her into a single published\nimpropriety, or caused her one known pang at the heart. Moreover, she\nhad never yearned for admiration; because that was her birthright by the\neternal privilege of beauty; she had always possessed it; she had not to\nturn her head for it, since spontaneously it always encompassed her.\nVanity, which in so many women approaches to a spiritual vice, and\ntherefore to a visible blemish; in her peculiar case--and though\npossessed in a transcendent degree--was still the token of the highest\nhealth; inasmuch as never knowing what it was to yearn for its\ngratification, she was almost entirely unconscious of possessing it at\nall. Many women carry this light of their lives flaming on their\nforeheads; but Mary Glendinning unknowingly bore hers within. Through\nall the infinite traceries of feminine art, she evenly glowed like a\nvase which, internally illuminated, gives no outward sign of the\nlighting flame, but seems to shine by the very virtue of the exquisite\nmarble itself. But that bluff corporeal admiration, with which some\nball-room women are content, was no admiration to the mother of Pierre.\nNot the general homage of men, but the selected homage of the noblest\nmen, was what she felt to be her appropriate right. And as her own\nmaternal partialities were added to, and glorified the rare and absolute\nmerits of Pierre; she considered the voluntary allegiance of his\naffectionate soul, the representative fealty of the choicest guild of\nhis race. Thus, though replenished through all her veins with the\nsubtlest vanity, with the homage of Pierre alone she was content.\n\nBut as to a woman of sense and spirit, the admiration of even the\nnoblest and most gifted man, is esteemed as nothing, so long as she\nremains conscious of possessing no directly influencing and practical\nsorcery over his soul; and as notwithstanding all his intellectual\nsuperiority to his mother, Pierre, through the unavoidable weakness of\ninexperienced and unexpanded youth, was strangely docile to the maternal\ntuitions in nearly all the things which thus far had any ways interested\nor affected him; therefore it was, that to Mary Glendinning this\nreverence of Pierre was invested with all the proudest delights and\nwitcheries of self-complacency, which it is possible for the most\nconquering virgin to feel. Still more. That nameless and infinitely\ndelicate aroma of inexpressible tenderness and attentiveness which, in\nevery refined and honorable attachment, is cotemporary with the\ncourtship, and precedes the final banns and the rite; but which, like\nthe _bouquet_ of the costliest German wines, too often evaporates upon\npouring love out to drink, in the disenchanting glasses of the\nmatrimonial days and nights; this highest and airiest thing in the whole\ncompass of the experience of our mortal life; this heavenly\nevanescence--still further etherealized in the filial breast--was for\nMary Glendinning, now not very far from her grand climacteric,\nmiraculously revived in the courteous lover-like adoration of Pierre.\n\nAltogether having its origin in a wonderful but purely fortuitous\ncombination of the happiest and rarest accidents of earth; and not to be\nlimited in duration by that climax which is so fatal to ordinary love;\nthis softened spell which still wheeled the mother and son in one orbit\nof joy, seemed a glimpse of the glorious possibility, that the divinest\nof those emotions, which are incident to the sweetest season of love, is\ncapable of an indefinite translation into many of the less signal\nrelations of our many chequered life. In a detached and individual way,\nit seemed almost to realize here below the sweet dreams of those\nreligious enthusiasts, who paint to us a Paradise to come, when\netherealized from all drosses and stains, the holiest passion of man\nshall unite all kindreds and climes in one circle of pure and\nunimpairable delight.\n\n\nVI.\n\nThere was one little uncelestial trait, which, in the opinion of some,\nmay mar the romantic merits of the gentlemanly Pierre Glendinning. He\nalways had an excellent appetite, and especially for his breakfast. But\nwhen we consider that though Pierre's hands were small, and his ruffles\nwhite, yet his arm was by no means dainty, and his complexion inclined\nto brown; and that he generally rose with the sun, and could not sleep\nwithout riding his twenty, or walking his twelve miles a day, or felling\na fair-sized hemlock in the forest, or boxing, or fencing, or boating,\nor performing some other gymnastical feat; when we consider these\nathletic habitudes of Pierre, and the great fullness of brawn and muscle\nthey built round about him; all of which manly brawn and muscle, three\ntimes a day loudly clamored for attention; we shall very soon perceive\nthat to have a bountiful appetite, was not only no vulgar reproach, but\na right royal grace and honor to Pierre; attesting him a man and a\ngentleman; for a thoroughly developed gentleman is always robust and\nhealthy; and Robustness and Health are great trencher-men.\n\nSo when Pierre and his mother descended to breakfast, and Pierre had\nscrupulously seen her supplied with whatever little things were\nconvenient to her; and had twice or thrice ordered the respectable and\nimmemorial Dates, the servitor, to adjust and re-adjust the\nwindow-sashes, so that no unkind current of air should take undue\nliberties with his mother's neck; after seeing to all this, but in a\nvery quiet and inconspicuous way; and also after directing the unruffled\nDates, to swing out, horizontally into a particular light, a fine joyous\npainting, in the good-fellow, Flemish style (which painting was so\nattached to the wall as to be capable of that mode of adjusting), and\nfurthermore after darting from where he sat a few invigorating glances\nover the river-meadows to the blue mountains beyond; Pierre made a\nmasonic sort of mysterious motion to the excellent Dates, who in\nautomaton obedience thereto, brought from a certain agreeable little\nside-stand, a very prominent-looking cold pasty; which, on careful\ninspection with the knife, proved to be the embossed savory nest of a\nfew uncommonly tender pigeons of Pierre's own shooting.\n\n\"Sister Mary,\" said he, lifting on his silver trident one of the\nchoicest of the many fine pigeon morsels; \"Sister Mary,\" said he, \"in\nshooting these pigeons, I was very careful to bring down one in such a\nmanner that the breast is entirely unmarred. It was intended for you!\nand here it is. Now Sergeant Dates, help hither your mistress' plate.\nNo?--nothing but the crumbs of French rolls, and a few peeps into a\ncoffee-cup--is that a breakfast for the daughter of yonder bold\nGeneral?\"--pointing to a full-length of his gold-laced grandfather on\nthe opposite wall. \"Well, pitiable is my case when I have to breakfast\nfor two. Dates!\"\n\n\"Sir.\"\n\n\"Remove that toast-rack, Dates; and this plate of tongue, and bring the\nrolls nearer, and wheel the stand farther off, good Dates.\"\n\nHaving thus made generous room for himself, Pierre commenced operations,\ninterrupting his mouthfuls by many sallies of mirthfulness.\n\n\"You seem to be in prodigious fine spirits this morning, brother\nPierre,\" said his mother.\n\n\"Yes, very tolerable; at least I can't say, that I am low-spirited\nexactly, sister Mary;--Dates, my fine fellow, bring me three bowls of\nmilk.\"\n\n\"One bowl, sir, you mean,\" said Dates, gravely and imperturbably.\n\nAs the servitor left the room, Mrs. Glendinning spoke. \"My dear Pierre,\nhow often have I begged you never to permit your hilariousness to betray\nyou into overstepping the exact line of propriety in your intercourse\nwith servants. Dates' look was a respectful reproof to you just now. You\nmust not call Dates, _My fine fellow_. He _is_ a fine fellow, a very\nfine fellow, indeed; but there is no need of telling him so at my table.\nIt is very easy to be entirely kind and pleasant to servants, without\nthe least touch of any shade of transient good-fellowship with them.\"\n\n\"Well, sister, no doubt you are altogether right; after this I shall\ndrop the _fine_, and call Dates nothing but _fellow_;--Fellow, come\nhere!--how will that answer?\"\n\n\"Not at all, Pierre--but you are a Romeo, you know, and so for the\npresent I pass over your nonsense.\"\n\n\"Romeo! oh, no. I am far from being Romeo--\" sighed Pierre. \"I laugh,\nbut he cried; poor Romeo! alas Romeo! woe is me, Romeo! he came to a\nvery deplorable end, did Romeo, sister Mary.\"\n\n\"It was his own fault though.\"\n\n\"Poor Romeo!\"\n\n\"He was disobedient to his parents.\"\n\n\"Alas Romeo!\"\n\n\"He married against their particular wishes.\"\n\n\"Woe is me, Romeo!\"\n\n\"But you, Pierre, are going to be married before long, I trust, not to a\nCapulet, but to one of our own Montagues; and so Romeo's evil fortune\nwill hardly be yours. You will be happy.\"\n\n\"The more miserable Romeo!\"\n\n\"Don't be so ridiculous, brother Pierre; so you are going to take Lucy\nthat long ride among the hills this morning? She is a sweet girl; a most\nlovely girl.\"\n\n\"Yes, that is rather my opinion, sister Mary.--By heavens, mother, the\nfive zones hold not such another! She is--yes--though I say\nit--Dates!--he's a precious long time getting that milk!\"\n\n\"Let him stay.--Don't be a milk-sop, Pierre!\"\n\n\"Ha! my sister is a little satirical this morning. I comprehend.\"\n\n\"Never rave, Pierre; and never rant. Your father never did either; nor\nis it written of Socrates; and both were very wise men. Your father was\nprofoundly in love--that I know to my certain knowledge--but I never\nheard him rant about it. He was always exceedingly gentlemanly: and\ngentlemen never rant. Milk-sops and Muggletonians rant, but gentlemen\nnever.\"\n\n\"Thank you, sister.--There, put it down, Dates; are the horses ready?\"\n\n\"Just driving round, sir, I believe.\"\n\n\"Why, Pierre,\" said his mother, glancing out at the window, \"are you\ngoing to Santa Fe De Bogota with that enormous old phaeton;--what do you\ntake that Juggernaut out for?\"\n\n\"Humor, sister, humor; I like it because it's old-fashioned, and because\nthe seat is such a wide sofa of a seat, and finally because a young lady\nby the name of Lucy Tartan cherishes a high regard for it. She vows she\nwould like to be married in it.\"\n\n\"Well, Pierre, all I have to say, is, be sure that Christopher puts the\ncoach-hammer and nails, and plenty of cords and screws into the box. And\nyou had better let him follow you in one of the farm wagons, with a\nspare axle and some boards.\"\n\n\"No fear, sister; no fear;--I shall take the best of care of the old\nphaeton. The quaint old arms on the panel, always remind me who it was\nthat first rode in it.\"\n\n\"I am glad you have that memory, brother Pierre.\"\n\n\"And who it was that _next_ rode in it.\"\n\n\"Bless you!--God bless you, my dear son!--always think of him and you\ncan never err; yes, always think of your dear perfect father, Pierre.\"\n\n\"Well, kiss me now, dear sister, for I must go.\"\n\n\"There; this is my cheek, and the other is Lucy's; though now that I\nlook at them both, I think that hers is getting to be the most blooming;\nsweeter dews fall on that one, I suppose.\"\n\nPierre laughed, and ran out of the room, for old Christopher was getting\nimpatient. His mother went to the window and stood there.\n\n\"A noble boy, and docile\"--she murmured--\"he has all the frolicsomeness\nof youth, with little of its giddiness. And he does not grow\nvain-glorious in sophomorean wisdom. I thank heaven I sent him not to\ncollege. A noble boy, and docile. A fine, proud, loving, docile,\nvigorous boy. Pray God, he never becomes otherwise to me. His little\nwife, that is to be, will not estrange him from me; for she too is\ndocile,--beautiful, and reverential, and most docile. Seldom yet have I\nknown such blue eyes as hers, that were not docile, and would not follow\na bold black one, as two meek blue-ribboned ewes, follow their martial\nleader. How glad am I that Pierre loves her so, and not some dark-eyed\nhaughtiness, with whom I could never live in peace; but who would be\never setting her young married state before my elderly widowed one, and\nclaiming all the homage of my dear boy--the fine, proud, loving, docile,\nvigorous boy!--the lofty-minded, well-born, noble boy; and with such\nsweet docilities! See his hair! He does in truth illustrate that fine\nsaying of his father's, that as the noblest colts, in three\npoints--abundant hair, swelling chest, and sweet docility--should\nresemble a fine woman, so should a noble youth. Well, good-bye, Pierre,\nand a merry morning to ye!\"\n\nSo saying she crossed the room, and--resting in a corner--her glad proud\neye met the old General's baton, which the day before in one of his\nfrolic moods Pierre had taken from its accustomed place in the\npictured-bannered hall. She lifted it, and musingly swayed it to and\nfro; then paused, and staff-wise rested with it in her hand. Her stately\nbeauty had ever somewhat martial in it; and now she looked the daughter\nof a General, as she was; for Pierre's was a double revolutionary\ndescent. On both sides he sprang from heroes.\n\n\"This is his inheritance--this symbol of command! and I swell out to\nthink it. Yet but just now I fondled the conceit that Pierre was so\nsweetly docile! Here sure is a most strange inconsistency! For is sweet\ndocility a general's badge? and is this baton but a distaff\nthen?--Here's something widely wrong. Now I almost wish him otherwise\nthan sweet and docile to me, seeing that it must be hard for man to be\nan uncompromising hero and a commander among his race, and yet never\nruffle any domestic brow. Pray heaven he show his heroicness in some\nsmooth way of favoring fortune, not be called out to be a hero of some\ndark hope forlorn;--of some dark hope forlorn, whose cruelness makes a\nsavage of a man. Give him, O God, regardful gales! Fan him with\nunwavering prosperities! So shall he remain all docility to me, and yet\nprove a haughty hero to the world!\"\n\n\n\n\nBOOK II.\n\nLOVE, DELIGHT, AND ALARM.\n\n\nI.\n\nOn the previous evening, Pierre had arranged with Lucy the plan of a\nlong winding ride, among the hills which stretched around to the\nsouthward from the wide plains of Saddle-Meadows.\n\nThough the vehicle was a sexagenarian, the animals that drew it, were\nbut six-year colts. The old phaeton had outlasted several generations of\nits drawers.\n\nPierre rolled beneath the village elms in billowy style, and soon drew\nup before the white cottage door. Flinging his reins upon the ground he\nentered the house.\n\nThe two colts were his particular and confidential friends; born on the\nsame land with him, and fed with the same corn, which, in the form of\nIndian-cakes, Pierre himself was often wont to eat for breakfast. The\nsame fountain that by one branch supplied the stables with water, by\nanother supplied Pierre's pitcher. They were a sort of family cousins to\nPierre, those horses; and they were splendid young cousins; very showy\nin their redundant manes and mighty paces, but not at all vain or\narrogant. They acknowledged Pierre as the undoubted head of the house of\nGlendinning. They well knew that they were but an inferior and\nsubordinate branch of the Glendinnings, bound in perpetual feudal fealty\nto its headmost representative. Therefore, these young cousins never\npermitted themselves to run from Pierre; they were impatient in their\npaces, but very patient in the halt. They were full of good-humor too,\nand kind as kittens.\n\n\"Bless me, how can you let them stand all alone that way, Pierre,\" cried\nLucy, as she and Pierre stepped forth from the cottage door, Pierre\nladen with shawls, parasol, reticule, and a small hamper.\n\n\"Wait a bit,\" cried Pierre, dropping his load; \"I will show you what my\ncolts are.\"\n\nSo saying, he spoke to them mildly, and went close up to them, and\npatted them. The colts neighed; the nigh colt neighing a little\njealously, as if Pierre had not patted impartially. Then, with a low,\nlong, almost inaudible whistle, Pierre got between the colts, among the\nharness. Whereat Lucy started, and uttered a faint cry, but Pierre told\nher to keep perfectly quiet, for there was not the least danger in the\nworld. And Lucy did keep quiet; for somehow, though she always started\nwhen Pierre seemed in the slightest jeopardy, yet at bottom she rather\ncherished a notion that Pierre bore a charmed life, and by no earthly\npossibility could die from her, or experience any harm, when she was\nwithin a thousand leagues.\n\nPierre, still between the horses, now stepped upon the pole of the\nphaeton; then stepping down, indefinitely disappeared, or became\npartially obscured among the living colonnade of the horses' eight\nslender and glossy legs. He entered the colonnade one way, and after a\nvariety of meanderings, came out another way; during all of which\nequestrian performance, the two colts kept gayly neighing, and\ngood-humoredly moving their heads perpendicularly up and down; and\nsometimes turning them sideways toward Lucy; as much as to say--We\nunderstand young master; we understand him, Miss; never fear, pretty\nlady: why, bless your delicious little heart, we played with Pierre\nbefore you ever did.\n\n\"Are you afraid of their running away now, Lucy?\" said Pierre, returning\nto her.\n\n\"Not much, Pierre; the superb fellows! Why, Pierre, they have made an\nofficer of you--look!\" and she pointed to two foam-flakes epauletting\nhis shoulders. \"Bravissimo again! I called you my recruit, when you left\nmy window this morning, and here you are promoted.\"\n\n\"Very prettily conceited, Lucy. But see, you don't admire their coats;\nthey wear nothing but the finest Genoa velvet, Lucy. See! did you ever\nsee such well-groomed horses?\"\n\n\"Never!\"\n\n\"Then what say you to have them for my groomsmen, Lucy? Glorious\ngroomsmen they would make, I declare. They should have a hundred ells of\nwhite favors all over their manes and tails; and when they drew us to\nchurch, they would be still all the time scattering white favors from\ntheir mouths, just as they did here on me. Upon my soul, they shall be\nmy groomsmen, Lucy. Stately stags! playful dogs! heroes, Lucy. We shall\nhave no marriage bells; they shall neigh for us, Lucy; we shall be\nwedded to the martial sound of Job's trumpeters, Lucy. Hark! they are\nneighing now to think of it.\"\n\n\"Neighing at your lyrics, Pierre. Come, let us be off. Here, the shawl,\nthe parasol, the basket: what are you looking at them so for?\"\n\n\"I was thinking, Lucy, of the sad state I am in. Not six months ago, I\nsaw a poor affianced fellow, an old comrade of mine, trudging along with\nhis Lucy Tartan, a hillock of bundles under either arm; and I said to\nmyself--There goes a sumpter, now; poor devil, he's a lover. And now\nlook at me! Well, life's a burden, they say; why not be burdened\ncheerily? But look ye, Lucy, I am going to enter a formal declaration\nand protest before matters go further with us. When we are married, I\nam not to carry any bundles, unless in cases of real need; and what is\nmore, when there are any of your young lady acquaintances in sight, I am\nnot to be unnecessarily called upon to back up, and load for their\nparticular edification.\"\n\n\"Now I am really vexed with you, Pierre; that is the first ill-natured\ninnuendo I ever heard from you. Are there any of my young lady\nacquaintances in sight now, I should like to know?\"\n\n\"Six of them, right over the way,\" said Pierre; \"but they keep behind\nthe curtains. I never trust your solitary village streets, Lucy.\nSharp-shooters behind every clap-board, Lucy.\"\n\n\"Pray, then, dear Pierre, do let us be off!\"\n\n\nII.\n\nWhile Pierre and Lucy are now rolling along under the elms, let it be\nsaid who Lucy Tartan was. It is needless to say that she was a beauty;\nbecause chestnut-haired, bright-cheeked youths like Pierre Glendinning,\nseldom fall in love with any but a beauty. And in the times to come,\nthere must be--as in the present times, and in the times gone by--some\nsplendid men, and some transcendent women; and how can they ever be,\nunless always, throughout all time, here and there, a handsome youth\nweds with a handsome maid!\n\nBut though owing to the above-named provisions of dame Nature, there\nalways will be beautiful women in the world; yet the world will never\nsee another Lucy Tartan. Her cheeks were tinted with the most delicate\nwhite and red, the white predominating. Her eyes some god brought down\nfrom heaven; her hair was Danae's, spangled with Jove's shower; her\nteeth were dived for in the Persian Sea.\n\nIf long wont to fix his glance on those who, trudging through the\nhumbler walks of life, and whom unequal toil and poverty deform; if that\nman shall haply view some fair and gracious daughter of the gods, who,\nfrom unknown climes of loveliness and affluence, comes floating into\nsight, all symmetry and radiance; how shall he be transported, that in a\nworld so full of vice and misery as ours, there should yet shine forth\nthis visible semblance of the heavens. For a lovely woman is not\nentirely of this earth. Her own sex regard her not as such. A crowd of\nwomen eye a transcendent beauty entering a room, much as though a bird\nfrom Arabia had lighted on the window sill. Say what you will, their\njealousy--if any--is but an afterbirth to their open admiration. Do men\nenvy the gods? And shall women envy the goddesses? A beautiful woman is\nborn Queen of men and women both, as Mary Stuart was born Queen of\nScots, whether men or women. All mankind are her Scots; her leal clans\nare numbered by the nations. A true gentleman in Kentucky would\ncheerfully die for a beautiful woman in Hindostan, though he never saw\nher. Yea, count down his heart in death-drops for her; and go to Pluto,\nthat she might go to Paradise. He would turn Turk before he would disown\nan allegiance hereditary to all gentlemen, from the hour their Grand\nMaster, Adam, first knelt to Eve.\n\nA plain-faced Queen of Spain dwells not in half the glory a beautiful\nmilliner does. Her soldiers can break heads, but her Highness can not\ncrack a heart; and the beautiful milliner might string hearts for\nnecklaces. Undoubtedly, Beauty made the first Queen. If ever again the\nsuccession to the German Empire should be contested, and one poor lame\nlawyer should present the claims of the first excellingly beautiful\nwoman he chanced to see--she would thereupon be unanimously elected\nEmpress of the Holy Roman German Empire;--that is to say, if all the\nGermans were true, free-hearted and magnanimous gentlemen, at all\ncapable of appreciating so immense an honor.\n\nIt is nonsense to talk of France as the seat of all civility. Did not\nthose French heathen have a Salique law? Three of the most bewitching\ncreatures,--immortal flowers of the line of Valois--were excluded from\nthe French throne by that infamous provision. France, indeed! whose\nCatholic millions still worship Mary Queen of Heaven; and for ten\ngenerations refused cap and knee to many angel Maries, rightful Queens\nof France. Here is cause for universal war. See how vilely nations, as\nwell as men, assume and wear unchallenged the choicest titles, however\nwithout merit. The Americans, and not the French, are the world's models\nof chivalry. Our Salique Law provides that universal homage shall be\npaid all beautiful women. No man's most solid rights shall weigh against\nher airiest whims. If you buy the best seat in the coach, to go and\nconsult a doctor on a matter of life and death, you shall cheerfully\nabdicate that best seat, and limp away on foot, if a pretty woman,\ntraveling, shake one feather from the stage-house door.\n\nNow, since we began by talking of a certain young lady that went out\nriding with a certain youth; and yet find ourselves, after leading such\na merry dance, fast by a stage-house window;--this may seem rather\nirregular sort of writing. But whither indeed should Lucy Tartan conduct\nus, but among mighty Queens, and all other creatures of high degree; and\nfinally set us roaming, to see whether the wide world can match so fine\na wonder. By immemorial usage, am I not bound to celebrate this Lucy\nTartan? Who shall stay me? Is she not my hero's own affianced? What can\nbe gainsaid? Where underneath the tester of the night sleeps such\nanother?\n\nYet, how would Lucy Tartan shrink from all this noise and clatter! She\nis bragged of, but not brags. Thus far she hath floated as stilly\nthrough this life, as thistle-down floats over meadows. Noiseless, she,\nexcept with Pierre; and even with him she lives through many a panting\nhush. Oh, those love-pauses that they know--how ominous of their\nfuture; for pauses precede the earthquake, and every other terrible\ncommotion! But blue be their sky awhile, and lightsome all their chat,\nand frolicsome their humors.\n\nNever shall I get down the vile inventory! How, if with paper and with\npencil I went out into the starry night to inventorize the heavens? Who\nshall tell stars as teaspoons? Who shall put down the charms of Lucy\nTartan upon paper?\n\nAnd for the rest; her parentage, what fortune she would possess, how\nmany dresses in her wardrobe, and how many rings upon her fingers;\ncheerfully would I let the genealogists, tax-gatherers, and upholsterers\nattend to that. My proper province is with the angelical part of Lucy.\nBut as in some quarters, there prevails a sort of prejudice against\nangels, who are merely angels and nothing more; therefore I shall\nmartyrize myself, by letting such gentlemen and ladies into some details\nof Lucy Tartan's history.\n\nShe was the daughter of an early and most cherished friend of Pierre's\nfather. But that father was now dead, and she resided an only daughter\nwith her mother, in a very fine house in the city. But though her home\nwas in the city, her heart was twice a year in the country. She did not\nat all love the city and its empty, heartless, ceremonial ways. It was\nvery strange, but most eloquently significant of her own natural\nangelhood that, though born among brick and mortar in a sea-port, she\nstill pined for unbaked earth and inland grass. So the sweet linnet,\nthough born inside of wires in a lady's chamber on the ocean coast, and\nignorant all its life of any other spot; yet, when spring-time comes, it\nis seized with flutterings and vague impatiences; it can not eat or\ndrink for these wild longings. Though unlearned by any experience, still\nthe inspired linnet divinely knows that the inland migrating time has\ncome. And just so with Lucy in her first longings for the verdure. Every\nspring those wild flutterings shook her; every spring, this sweet\nlinnet girl did migrate inland. Oh God grant that those other and long\nafter nameless flutterings of her inmost soul, when all life was become\nweary to her--God grant, that those deeper flutterings in her were\nequally significant of her final heavenly migration from this heavy\nearth.\n\nIt was fortunate for Lucy that her Aunt Lanyllyn--a pensive, childless,\nwhite-turbaned widow--possessed and occupied a pretty cottage in the\nvillage of Saddle Meadows; and still more fortunate, that this excellent\nold aunt was very partial to her, and always felt a quiet delight in\nhaving Lucy near her. So Aunt Lanyllyn's cottage, in effect, was Lucy's.\nAnd now, for some years past, she had annually spent several months at\nSaddle Meadows; and it was among the pure and soft incitements of the\ncountry that Pierre first had felt toward Lucy the dear passion which\nnow made him wholly hers.\n\nLucy had two brothers; one her senior, by three years, and the other her\njunior by two. But these young men were officers in the navy; and so\nthey did not permanently live with Lucy and her mother.\n\nMrs. Tartan was mistress of an ample fortune. She was, moreover,\nperfectly aware that such was the fact, and was somewhat inclined to\nforce it upon the notice of other people, nowise interested in the\nmatter. In other words, Mrs. Tartan, instead of being daughter-proud,\nfor which she had infinite reason, was a little inclined to being\npurse-proud, for which she had not the slightest reason; seeing that the\nGreat Mogul probably possessed a larger fortune than she, not to speak\nof the Shah of Persia and Baron Rothschild, and a thousand other\nmillionaires; whereas, the Grand Turk, and all their other majesties of\nEurope, Asia, and Africa to boot, could not, in all their joint\ndominions, boast so sweet a girl as Lucy. Nevertheless, Mrs. Tartan was\nan excellent sort of lady, as this lady-like world goes. She subscribed\nto charities, and owned five pews in as many churches, and went about\ntrying to promote the general felicity of the world, by making all the\nhandsome young people of her acquaintance marry one another. In other\nwords, she was a match-maker--not a Lucifer match-maker--though, to tell\nthe truth, she may have kindled the matrimonial blues in certain\ndissatisfied gentlemen's breasts, who had been wedded under her\nparticular auspices, and by her particular advice. Rumor said--but rumor\nis always fibbing--that there was a secret society of dissatisfied young\nhusbands, who were at the pains of privately circulating handbills among\nall unmarried young strangers, warning them against the insidious\napproaches of Mrs. Tartan; and, for reference, named themselves in\ncipher. But this could not have been true; for, flushed with a thousand\nmatches--burning blue or bright, it made little matter--Mrs. Tartan\nsailed the seas of fashion, causing all topsails to lower to her; and\ntowing flotillas of young ladies, for all of whom she was bound to find\nthe finest husband harbors in the world.\n\nBut does not match-making, like charity, begin at home? Why is her own\ndaughter Lucy without a mate? But not so fast; Mrs. Tartan years ago\nlaid out that sweet programme concerning Pierre and Lucy; but in this\ncase, her programme happened to coincide, in some degree, with a\nprevious one in heaven, and only for that cause did it come to pass,\nthat Pierre Glendinning was the proud elect of Lucy Tartan. Besides,\nthis being a thing so nearly affecting herself, Mrs. Tartan had, for the\nmost part, been rather circumspect and cautious in all her\nmanoeuvrings with Pierre and Lucy. Moreover, the thing demanded no\nmanoeuvring at all. The two Platonic particles, after roaming in quest\nof each other, from the time of Saturn and Ops till now; they came\ntogether before Mrs. Tartan's own eyes; and what more could Mrs. Tartan\ndo toward making them forever one and indivisible? Once, and only once,\nhad a dim suspicion passed through Pierre's mind, that Mrs. Tartan was a\nlady thimble-rigger, and slyly rolled the pea.\n\nIn their less mature acquaintance, he was breakfasting with Lucy and\nher mother in the city, and the first cup of coffee had been poured out\nby Mrs. Tartan, when she declared she smelt matches burning somewhere in\nthe house, and she must see them extinguished. So banning all pursuit,\nshe rose to seek for the burning matches, leaving the pair alone to\ninterchange the civilities of the coffee; and finally sent word to them,\nfrom above stairs, that the matches, or something else, had given her a\nheadache, and begged Lucy to send her up some toast and tea, for she\nwould breakfast in her own chamber that morning.\n\nUpon this, Pierre looked from Lucy to his boots, and as he lifted his\neyes again, saw Anacreon on the sofa on one side of him, and Moore's\nMelodies on the other, and some honey on the table, and a bit of white\nsatin on the floor, and a sort of bride's veil on the chandelier.\n\nNever mind though--thought Pierre, fixing his gaze on Lucy--I'm entirely\nwilling to be caught, when the bait is set in Paradise, and the bait is\nsuch an angel. Again he glanced at Lucy, and saw a look of infinite\nsubdued vexation, and some unwonted pallor on her cheek. Then willingly\nhe would have kissed the delicious bait, that so gently hated to be\ntasted in the trap. But glancing round again, and seeing that the music,\nwhich Mrs. Tartan, under the pretense of putting in order, had been\nadjusting upon the piano; seeing that this music was now in a vertical\npile against the wall, with--\"_Love was once a little boy_,\" for the\noutermost and only visible sheet; and thinking this to be a remarkable\ncoincidence under the circumstances; Pierre could not refrain from a\nhumorous smile, though it was a very gentle one, and immediately\nrepented of, especially as Lucy seeing and interpreting it, immediately\narose, with an unaccountable, indignant, angelical, adorable, and\nall-persuasive \"Mr. Glendinning?\" utterly confounded in him the\nslightest germ of suspicion as to Lucy's collusion in her mother's\nimagined artifices.\n\nIndeed, Mrs. Tartan's having any thing whatever to do, or hint, or\nfinesse in this matter of the loves of Pierre and Lucy, was nothing less\nthan immensely gratuitous and sacrilegious. Would Mrs. Tartan doctor\nlilies when they blow? Would Mrs. Tartan set about match-making between\nthe steel and magnet? Preposterous Mrs. Tartan! But this whole world is\na preposterous one, with many preposterous people in it; chief among\nwhom was Mrs. Tartan, match-maker to the nation.\n\nThis conduct of Mrs. Tartan, was the more absurd, seeing that she could\nnot but know that Mrs. Glendinning desired the thing. And was not Lucy\nwealthy?--going to be, that is, very wealthy when her mother died;--(sad\nthought that for Mrs. Tartan)--and was not her husband's family of the\nbest; and had not Lucy's father been a bosom friend of Pierre's father?\nAnd though Lucy might be matched to some one man, where among women was\nthe match for Lucy? Exceedingly preposterous Mrs. Tartan! But when a\nlady like Mrs. Tartan has nothing positive and useful to do, then she\nwill do just such preposterous things as Mrs. Tartan did.\n\nWell, time went on; and Pierre loved Lucy, and Lucy, Pierre; till at\nlast the two young naval gentlemen, her brothers, happened to arrive in\nMrs. Tartan's drawing-room, from their first cruise--a three years' one\nup the Mediterranean. They rather stared at Pierre, finding him on the\nsofa, and Lucy not very remote.\n\n\"Pray, be seated, gentlemen,\" said Pierre. \"Plenty of room.\"\n\n\"My darling brothers!\" cried Lucy, embracing them.\n\n\"My darling brothers and sister!\" cried Pierre, folding them together.\n\n\"Pray, hold off, sir,\" said the elder brother, who had served as a\npassed midshipman for the last two weeks. The younger brother retreated\na little, and clapped his hand upon his dirk, saying, \"Sir, we are from\nthe Mediterranean. Sir, permit me to say, this is decidedly improper!\nWho may you be, sir?\"\n\n\"I can't explain for joy,\" cried Pierre, hilariously embracing them all\nagain.\n\n\"Most extraordinary!\" cried the elder brother, extricating his\nshirt-collar from the embrace, and pulling it up vehemently.\n\n\"Draw!\" cried the younger, intrepidly.\n\n\"Peace, foolish fellows,\" cried Lucy--\"this is your old play-fellow,\nPierre Glendinning.\"\n\n\"Pierre? why, Pierre?\" cried the lads--\"a hug all round again! You've\ngrown a fathom!--who would have known you? But, then--Lucy? I say,\nLucy?--what business have you here in this--eh? eh?--hugging-match, I\nshould call it?\"\n\n\"Oh! Lucy don't mean any thing,\" cried Pierre--\"come, one more all\nround.\"\n\nSo they all embraced again; and that evening it was publicly known that\nPierre was to wed with Lucy.\n\nWhereupon, the young officers took it upon themselves to think--though\nthey by no means presumed to breathe it--that they had authoritatively,\nthough indirectly, accelerated a before ambiguous and highly\nincommendable state of affairs between the now affianced lovers.\n\n\nIII.\n\nIn the fine old robust times of Pierre's grandfather, an American\ngentleman of substantial person and fortune spent his time in a somewhat\ndifferent style from the green-house gentlemen of the present day. The\ngrandfather of Pierre measured six feet four inches in height; during a\nfire in the old manorial mansion, with one dash of his foot, he had\nsmitten down an oaken door, to admit the buckets of his negro slaves;\nPierre had often tried on his military vest, which still remained an\nheirloom at Saddle Meadows, and found the pockets below his knees, and\nplenty additional room for a fair-sized quarter-cask within its buttoned\ngirth; in a night-scuffle in the wilderness before the Revolutionary\nWar, he had annihilated two Indian savages by making reciprocal\nbludgeons of their heads. And all this was done by the mildest hearted,\nand most blue-eyed gentleman in the world, who, according to the\npatriarchal fashion of those days, was a gentle, white-haired worshiper\nof all the household gods; the gentlest husband, and the gentlest\nfather; the kindest of masters to his slaves; of the most wonderful\nunruffledness of temper; a serene smoker of his after-dinner pipe; a\nforgiver of many injuries; a sweet-hearted, charitable Christian; in\nfine, a pure, cheerful, child-like, blue-eyed, divine old man; in whose\nmeek, majestic soul, the lion and the lamb embraced--fit image of his\nGod.\n\nNever could Pierre look upon his fine military portrait without an\ninfinite and mournful longing to meet his living aspect in actual life.\nThe majestic sweetness of this portrait was truly wonderful in its\neffects upon any sensitive and generous-minded young observer. For such,\nthat portrait possessed the heavenly persuasiveness of angelic speech; a\nglorious gospel framed and hung upon the wall, and declaring to all\npeople, as from the Mount, that man is a noble, god-like being, full of\nchoicest juices; made up of strength and beauty.\n\nNow, this grand old Pierre Glendinning was a great lover of horses; but\nnot in the modern sense, for he was no jockey;--one of his most intimate\nfriends of the masculine gender was a huge, proud, gray horse, of a\nsurprising reserve of manner, his saddle-beast; he had his horses'\nmangers carved like old trenchers, out of solid maple logs; the key of\nthe corn-bin hung in his library; and no one grained his steeds, but\nhimself; unless his absence from home promoted Moyar, an incorruptible\nand most punctual old black, to that honorable office. He said that no\nman loved his horses, unless his own hands grained them. Every Christmas\nhe gave them brimming measures. \"I keep Christmas with my horses,\" said\ngrand old Pierre. This grand old Pierre always rose at sunrise; washed\nhis face and chest in the open air; and then, returning to his closet,\nand being completely arrayed at last, stepped forth to make a\nceremonious call at his stables, to bid his very honorable friends there\na very good and joyful morning. Woe to Cranz, Kit, Douw, or any other of\nhis stable slaves, if grand old Pierre found one horse unblanketed, or\none weed among the hay that filled their rack. Not that he ever had\nCranz, Kit, Douw, or any of them flogged--a thing unknown in that\npatriarchal time and country--but he would refuse to say his wonted\npleasant word to them; and that was very bitter to them, for Cranz, Kit,\nDouw, and all of them, loved grand old Pierre, as his shepherds loved\nold Abraham.\n\nWhat decorous, lordly, gray-haired steed is this? What old Chaldean\nrides abroad?--'Tis grand old Pierre; who, every morning before he eats,\ngoes out promenading with his saddle-beast; nor mounts him, without\nfirst asking leave. But time glides on, and grand old Pierre grows old:\nhis life's glorious grape now swells with fatness; he has not the\nconscience to saddle his majestic beast with such a mighty load of\nmanliness. Besides, the noble beast himself is growing old, and has a\ntouching look of meditativeness in his large, attentive eyes. Leg of\nman, swears grand old Pierre, shall never more bestride my steed; no\nmore shall harness touch him! Then every spring he sowed a field with\nclover for his steed; and at mid-summer sorted all his meadow grasses,\nfor the choicest hay to winter him; and had his destined grain thrashed\nout with a flail, whose handle had once borne a flag in a brisk battle,\ninto which this same old steed had pranced with grand old Pierre; one\nwaving mane, one waving sword!\n\nNow needs must grand old Pierre take a morning drive; he rides no more\nwith the old gray steed. He has a phaeton built, fit for a vast General,\nin whose sash three common men might hide. Doubled, trebled are the\nhuge S shaped leather springs; the wheels seem stolen from some mill;\nthe canopied seat is like a testered bed. From beneath the old archway,\nnot one horse, but two, every morning now draw forth old Pierre, as the\nChinese draw their fat god Josh, once every year from out his fane.\n\nBut time glides on, and a morning comes, when the phaeton emerges not;\nbut all the yards and courts are full; helmets line the ways;\nsword-points strike the stone steps of the porch; muskets ring upon the\nstairs; and mournful martial melodies are heard in all the halls. Grand\nold Pierre is dead; and like a hero of old battles, he dies on the eve\nof another war; ere wheeling to fire on the foe, his platoons fire over\ntheir old commander's grave; in A. D. 1812, died grand old Pierre. The\ndrum that beat in brass his funeral march, was a British kettle-drum,\nthat had once helped beat the vain-glorious march, for the thirty\nthousand predestined prisoners, led into sure captivity by that bragging\nboy, Burgoyne.\n\nNext day the old gray steed turned from his grain; turned round, and\nvainly whinnied in his stall. By gracious Moyar's hand, he refuses to be\npatted now; plain as horse can speak, the old gray steed says--\"I smell\nnot the wonted hand; where is grand old Pierre? Grain me not, and groom\nme not;--Where is grand old Pierre?\"\n\nHe sleeps not far from his master now; beneath the field he cropt, he\nhas softly lain him down; and long ere this, grand old Pierre and steed\nhave passed through that grass to glory.\n\nBut his phaeton--like his plumed hearse, outlives the noble load it\nbore. And the dark bay steeds that drew grand old Pierre alive, and by\nhis testament drew him dead, and followed the lordly lead of the led\ngray horse; those dark bay steeds are still extant; not in themselves or\nin their issue; but in the two descendants of stallions of their own\nbreed. For on the lands of Saddle Meadows, man and horse are both\nhereditary; and this bright morning Pierre Glendinning, grandson of\ngrand old Pierre, now drives forth with Lucy Tartan, seated where his\nown ancestor had sat, and reining steeds, whose\ngreat-great-great-grandfathers grand old Pierre had reined before.\n\nHow proud felt Pierre: In fancy's eye, he saw the horse-ghosts a-tandem\nin the van; \"These are but wheelers\"--cried young Pierre--\"the leaders\nare the generations.\"\n\n\nIV.\n\nBut Love has more to do with his own possible and probable posterities,\nthan with the once living but now impossible ancestries in the past. So\nPierre's glow of family pride quickly gave place to a deeper hue, when\nLucy bade love's banner blush out from his cheek.\n\nThat morning was the choicest drop that Time had in his vase. Ineffable\ndistillations of a soft delight were wafted from the fields and hills.\nFatal morning that, to all lovers unbetrothed; \"Come to your\nconfessional,\" it cried. \"Behold our airy loves,\" the birds chirped from\nthe trees; far out at sea, no more the sailors tied their bowline-knots;\ntheir hands had lost their cunning; will they, nill they, Love tied\nlove-knots on every spangled spar.\n\nOh, praised be the beauty of this earth, the beauty, and the bloom, and\nthe mirthfulness thereof! The first worlds made were winter worlds; the\nsecond made, were vernal worlds; the third, and last, and perfectest,\nwas this summer world of ours. In the cold and nether spheres, preachers\npreach of earth, as we of Paradise above. Oh, there, my friends, they\nsay, they have a season, in their language known as summer. Then their\nfields spin themselves green carpets; snow and ice are not in all the\nland; then a million strange, bright, fragrant things powder that sward\nwith perfumes; and high, majestic beings, dumb and grand, stand up with\noutstretched arms, and hold their green canopies over merry angels--men\nand women--who love and wed, and sleep and dream, beneath the approving\nglances of their visible god and goddess, glad-hearted sun, and pensive\nmoon!\n\nOh, praised be the beauty of this earth; the beauty, and the bloom, and\nthe mirthfulness thereof. We lived before, and shall live again; and as\nwe hope for a fairer world than this to come; so we came from one less\nfine. From each successive world, the demon Principle is more and more\ndislodged; he is the accursed clog from chaos, and thither, by every new\ntranslation, we drive him further and further back again. Hosannahs to\nthis world! so beautiful itself, and the vestibule to more. Out of some\npast Egypt, we have come to this new Canaan; and from this new Canaan,\nwe press on to some Circassia. Though still the villains, Want and Woe,\nfollowed us out of Egypt, and now beg in Canaan's streets: yet\nCircassia's gates shall not admit them; they, with their sire, the demon\nPrinciple, must back to chaos, whence they came.\n\nLove was first begot by Mirth and Peace, in Eden, when the world was\nyoung. The man oppressed with cares, he can not love; the man of gloom\nfinds not the god. So, as youth, for the most part, has no cares, and\nknows no gloom, therefore, ever since time did begin, youth belongs to\nlove. Love may end in grief and age, and pain and need, and all other\nmodes of human mournfulness; but love begins in joy. Love's first sigh\nis never breathed, till after love hath laughed. Love laughs first, and\nthen sighs after. Love has not hands, but cymbals; Love's mouth is\nchambered like a bugle, and the instinctive breathings of his life\nbreathe jubilee notes of joy!\n\nThat morning, two bay horses drew two Laughs along the road that led to\nthe hills from Saddle Meadows. Apt time they kept; Pierre Glendinning's\nyoung, manly tenor, to Lucy Tartan's girlish treble.\n\nWondrous fair of face, blue-eyed, and golden-haired, the bright blonde,\nLucy, was arrayed in colors harmonious with the heavens. Light blue be\nthy perpetual color, Lucy; light blue becomes thee best--such the\nrepeated azure counsel of Lucy Tartan's mother. On both sides, from the\nhedges, came to Pierre the clover bloom of Saddle Meadows, and from\nLucy's mouth and cheek came the fresh fragrance of her violet young\nbeing.\n\n\"Smell I the flowers, or thee?\" cried Pierre.\n\n\"See I lakes, or eyes?\" cried Lucy, her own gazing down into his soul,\nas two stars gaze down into a tarn.\n\nNo Cornwall miner ever sunk so deep a shaft beneath the sea, as Love\nwill sink beneath the floatings of the eyes. Love sees ten million\nfathoms down, till dazzled by the floor of pearls. The eye is Love's own\nmagic glass, where all things that are not of earth, glide in\nsupernatural light. There are not so many fishes in the sea, as there\nare sweet images in lovers' eyes. In those miraculous translucencies\nswim the strange eye-fish with wings, that sometimes leap out, instinct\nwith joy; moist fish-wings wet the lover's cheek. Love's eyes are holy\nthings; therein the mysteries of life are lodged; looking in each\nother's eyes, lovers see the ultimate secret of the worlds; and with\nthrills eternally untranslatable, feel that Love is god of all. Man or\nwoman who has never loved, nor once looked deep down into their own\nlover's eyes, they know not the sweetest and the loftiest religion of\nthis earth. Love is both Creator's and Saviour's gospel to mankind; a\nvolume bound in rose-leaves, clasped with violets, and by the beaks of\nhumming-birds printed with peach-juice on the leaves of lilies.\n\nEndless is the account of Love. Time and space can not contain Love's\nstory. All things that are sweet to see, or taste, or feel, or hear,\nall these things were made by Love; and none other things were made by\nLove. Love made not the Arctic zones, but Love is ever reclaiming them.\nSay, are not the fierce things of this earth daily, hourly going out?\nWhere now are your wolves of Britain? Where in Virginia now, find you\nthe panther and the pard? Oh, love is busy everywhere. Everywhere Love\nhath Moravian missionaries. No Propagandist like to love. The south wind\nwooes the barbarous north; on many a distant shore the gentler west wind\npersuades the arid east.\n\nAll this Earth is Love's affianced; vainly the demon Principle howls to\nstay the banns. Why round her middle wears this world so rich a zone of\ntorrid verdure, if she be not dressing for the final rites? And why\nprovides she orange blossoms and lilies of the valley, if she would not\nthat all men and maids should love and marry? For every wedding where\ntrue lovers wed, helps on the march of universal Love. Who are brides\nhere shall be Love's bridemaids in the marriage world to come. So on all\nsides Love allures; can contain himself what youth who views the wonders\nof the beauteous woman-world? Where a beautiful woman is, there is all\nAsia and her Bazars. Italy hath not a sight before the beauty of a\nYankee girl; nor heaven a blessing beyond her earthly love. Did not the\nangelical Lotharios come down to earth, that they might taste of mortal\nwoman's Love and Beauty? even while her own silly brothers were pining\nafter the self-same Paradise they left? Yes, those envying angels did\ncome down; did emigrate; and who emigrates except to be better off?\n\nLove is this world's great redeemer and reformer; and as all beautiful\nwomen are her selectest emissaries, so hath Love gifted them with a\nmagnetical persuasiveness, that no youth can possibly repel. The own\nheart's choice of every youth, seems ever as an inscrutable witch to\nhim; and by ten thousand concentric spells and circling incantations,\nglides round and round him, as he turns: murmuring meanings of\nunearthly import; and summoning up to him all the subterranean sprites\nand gnomes; and unpeopling all the sea for naiads to swim round him; so\nthat mysteries are evoked as in exhalations by this Love;--what wonder\nthen that Love was aye a mystic?\n\n\nV.\n\nAnd this self-same morning Pierre was very mystical; not continually,\nthough; but most mystical one moment, and overflowing with mad,\nunbridled merriment, the next. He seemed a youthful Magian, and almost a\nmountebank together. Chaldaic improvisations burst from him, in quick\nGolden Verses, on the heel of humorous retort and repartee. More\nespecially, the bright glance of Lucy was transporting to him. Now,\nreckless of his horses, with both arms holding Lucy in his embrace, like\na Sicilian diver he dives deep down in the Adriatic of her eyes, and\nbrings up some king's-cup of joy. All the waves in Lucy's eyes seemed\nwaves of infinite glee to him. And as if, like veritable seas, they did\nindeed catch the reflected irradiations of that pellucid azure morning;\nin Lucy's eyes, there seemed to shine all the blue glory of the general\nday, and all the sweet inscrutableness of the sky. And certainly, the\nblue eye of woman, like the sea, is not uninfluenced by the atmosphere.\nOnly in the open air of some divinest, summer day, will you see its\nultramarine,--its fluid lapis lazuli. Then would Pierre burst forth in\nsome screaming shout of joy; and the striped tigers of his chestnut eyes\nleaped in their lashed cages with a fierce delight. Lucy shrank from him\nin extreme love; for the extremest top of love, is Fear and Wonder.\n\nSoon the swift horses drew this fair god and goddess nigh the wooded\nhills, whose distant blue, now changed into a variously-shaded green,\nstood before them like old Babylonian walls, overgrown with verdure;\nwhile here and there, at regular intervals, the scattered peaks seemed\nmural towers; and the clumped pines surmounting them, as lofty archers,\nand vast, out-looking watchers of the glorious Babylonian City of the\nDay. Catching that hilly air, the prancing horses neighed; laughed on\nthe ground with gleeful feet. Felt they the gay delightsome spurrings of\nthe day; for the day was mad with excessive joy; and high in heaven you\nheard the neighing of the horses of the sun; and down dropt their\nnostrils' froth in many a fleecy vapor from the hills.\n\nFrom the plains, the mists rose slowly; reluctant yet to quit so fair a\nmead. At those green slopings, Pierre reined in his steeds, and soon the\ntwain were seated on the bank, gazing far, and far away; over many a\ngrove and lake; corn-crested uplands, and Herd's-grass lowlands; and\nlong-stretching swales of vividest green, betokening where the greenest\nbounty of this earth seeks its winding channels; as ever, the most\nheavenly bounteousness most seeks the lowly places; making green and\nglad many a humble mortal's breast, and leaving to his own lonely\naridness, many a hill-top prince's state.\n\nBut Grief, not Joy, is a moralizer; and small moralizing wisdom caught\nPierre from that scene. With Lucy's hand in his, and feeling, softly\nfeeling of its soft tinglingness; he seemed as one placed in linked\ncorrespondence with the summer lightnings; and by sweet shock on shock,\nreceiving intimating fore-tastes of the etherealest delights of earth.\n\nNow, prone on the grass he falls, with his attentive upward glance fixed\non Lucy's eyes. \"Thou art my heaven, Lucy; and here I lie thy\nshepherd-king, watching for new eye-stars to rise in thee. Ha! I see\nVenus' transit now;--lo! a new planet there;--and behind all, an\ninfinite starry nebulousness, as if thy being were backgrounded by some\nspangled vail of mystery.\"\n\nIs Lucy deaf to all these ravings of his lyric love? Why looks she down,\nand vibrates so; and why now from her over-charged lids, drops such warm\ndrops as these? No joy now in Lucy's eyes, and seeming tremor on her\nlips.\n\n\"Ah! thou too ardent and impetuous Pierre!\"\n\n\"Nay, thou too moist and changeful April! know'st thou not, that the\nmoist and changeful April is followed by the glad, assured, and\nshowerless joy of June? And this, Lucy, this day should be thy June,\neven as it is the earth's?\"\n\n\"Ah Pierre! not June to me. But say, are not the sweets of June made\nsweet by the April tears?\"\n\n\"Ay, love! but here fall more drops,--more and more;--these showers are\nlonger than beseem the April, and pertain not to the June.\"\n\n\"June! June!--thou bride's month of the summer,--following the spring's\nsweet courtship of the earth,--my June, my June is yet to come!\"\n\n\"Oh! yet to come, but fixedly decreed;--good as come, and better.\"\n\n\"Then no flower that, in the bud, the April showers have nurtured; no\nsuch flower may untimely perish, ere the June unfolds it? Ye will not\nswear that, Pierre?\"\n\n\"The audacious immortalities of divinest love are in me; and I now swear\nto thee all the immutable eternities of joyfulness, that ever woman\ndreamed of, in this dream-house of the earth. A god decrees to thee\nunchangeable felicity; and to me, the unchallenged possession of thee\nand them, for my inalienable fief.--Do I rave? Look on me, Lucy; think\non me, girl.\"\n\n\"Thou art young, and beautiful, and strong; and a joyful manliness\ninvests thee, Pierre; and thy intrepid heart never yet felt the touch of\nfear;--But--\"\n\n\"But what?\"\n\n\"Ah, my best Pierre!\"\n\n\"With kisses I will suck thy secret from thy cheek!--but what?\"\n\n\"Let us hie homeward, Pierre. Some nameless sadness, faintness,\nstrangely comes to me. Foretaste I feel of endless dreariness. Tell me\nonce more the story of that face, Pierre,--that mysterious, haunting\nface, which thou once told'st me, thou didst thrice vainly try to shun.\nBlue is the sky, oh, bland the air, Pierre;--but--tell me the story of\nthe face,--the dark-eyed, lustrous, imploring, mournful face, that so\nmystically paled, and shrunk at thine. Ah, Pierre, sometimes I have\nthought,--never will I wed with my best Pierre, until the riddle of that\nface be known. Tell me, tell me, Pierre;--as a fixed basilisk, with eyes\nof steady, flaming mournfulness, that face this instant fastens me.\"\n\n\"Bewitched! bewitched!--Cursed be the hour I acted on the thought, that\nLove hath no reserves. Never should I have told thee the story of that\nface, Lucy. I have bared myself too much to thee. Oh, never should Love\nknow all!\"\n\n\"Knows not all, then loves not all, Pierre. Never shalt thou so say\nagain;--and Pierre, listen to me. Now,--now, in this inexplicable\ntrepidation that I feel, I do conjure thee, that thou wilt ever continue\nto do as thou hast done; so that I may ever continue to know all that\nagitatest thee, the airiest and most transient thought, that ever shall\nsweep into thee from the wide atmosphere of all things that hem\nmortality. Did I doubt thee here;--could I ever think, that thy heart\nhath yet one private nook or corner from me;--fatal disenchanting day\nfor me, my Pierre, would that be. I tell thee, Pierre--and 'tis Love's\nown self that now speaks through me--only in unbounded confidence and\ninterchangings of all subtlest secrets, can Love possibly endure. Love's\nself is a secret, and so feeds on secrets, Pierre. Did I only know of\nthee, what the whole common world may know--what then were Pierre to\nme?--Thou must be wholly a disclosed secret to me; Love is vain and\nproud; and when I walk the streets, and meet thy friends, I must still\nbe laughing and hugging to myself the thought,--They know him not;--I\nonly know my Pierre;--none else beneath the circuit of yon sun. Then,\nswear to me, dear Pierre, that thou wilt never keep a secret from\nme--no, never, never;--swear!\"\n\n\"Something seizes me. Thy inexplicable tears, falling, falling on my\nheart, have now turned it to a stone. I feel icy cold and hard; I will\nnot swear!\"\n\n\"Pierre! Pierre!\"\n\n\"God help thee, and God help me, Lucy. I can not think, that in this\nmost mild and dulcet air, the invisible agencies are plotting treasons\nagainst our loves. Oh! if ye be now nigh us, ye things I have no name\nfor; then by a name that should be efficacious--by Christ's holy name, I\nwarn ye back from her and me. Touch her not, ye airy devils; hence to\nyour appointed hell! why come ye prowling in these heavenly perlieus?\nCan not the chains of Love omnipotent bind ye, fiends?\"\n\n\"Is this Pierre? His eyes glare fearfully; now I see layer on layer\ndeeper in him; he turns round and menaces the air and talks to it, as if\ndefied by the air. Woe is me, that fairy love should raise this evil\nspell!--Pierre?\"\n\n\"But now I was infinite distances from thee, oh my Lucy, wandering\nbaffled in the choking night; but thy voice might find me, though I had\nwandered to the Boreal realm, Lucy. Here I sit down by thee; I catch a\nsoothing from thee.\"\n\n\"My own, own Pierre! Pierre, into ten trillion pieces I could now be\ntorn for thee; in my bosom would yet hide thee, and there keep thee\nwarm, though I sat down on Arctic ice-floes, frozen to a corpse. My own,\nbest, blessed Pierre! Now, could I plant some poniard in me, that my\nsilly ailings should have power to move thee thus, and pain thee thus.\nForgive me, Pierre; thy changed face hath chased the other from me; the\nfright of thee exceeds all other frights. It does not so haunt me now.\nPress hard my hand; look hard on me, my love, that its last trace may\npass away. Now I feel almost whole again; now, 'tis gone. Up, my Pierre;\nlet us up, and fly these hills, whence, I fear, too wide a prospect\nmeets us. Fly we to the plain. See, thy steeds neigh for thee--they call\nthee--see, the clouds fly down toward the plain--lo, these hills now\nseem all desolate to me, and the vale all verdure. Thank thee,\nPierre.--See, now, I quit the hills, dry-cheeked; and leave all tears\nbehind to be sucked in by these evergreens, meet emblems of the\nunchanging love, my own sadness nourishes in me. Hard fate, that Love's\nbest verdure should feed so on tears!\"\n\nNow they rolled swiftly down the slopes; nor tempted the upper hills;\nbut sped fast for the plain. Now the cloud hath passed from Lucy's eye;\nno more the lurid slanting light forks upward from her lover's brow. In\nthe plain they find peace, and love, and joy again.\n\n\"It was the merest, idling, wanton vapor, Lucy!\"\n\n\"An empty echo, Pierre, of a sad sound, long past. Bless thee, my\nPierre!\"\n\n\"The great God wrap thee ever, Lucy. So, now, we are home.\"\n\n\nVI.\n\nAfter seeing Lucy into her aunt's most cheerful parlor, and seating her\nby the honeysuckle that half clambered into the window there; and near\nto which was her easel for crayon-sketching, upon part of whose frame\nLucy had cunningly trained two slender vines, into whose earth-filled\npots two of the three legs of the easel were inserted; and sitting down\nhimself by her, and by his pleasant, lightsome chat, striving to chase\nthe last trace of sadness from her; and not till his object seemed fully\ngained; Pierre rose to call her good aunt to her, and so take his leave\ntill evening, when Lucy called him back, begging him first to bring her\nthe blue portfolio from her chamber, for she wished to kill her last\nlingering melancholy--if any indeed did linger now--by diverting her\nthoughts, in a little pencil sketch, to scenes widely different from\nthose of Saddle Meadows and its hills.\n\nSo Pierre went up stairs, but paused on the threshold of the open door.\nHe never had entered that chamber but with feelings of a wonderful\nreverentialness. The carpet seemed as holy ground. Every chair seemed\nsanctified by some departed saint, there once seated long ago. Here his\nbook of Love was all a rubric, and said--Bow now, Pierre, bow. But this\nextreme loyalty to the piety of love, called from him by such glimpses\nof its most secret inner shrine, was not unrelieved betimes by such\nquickenings of all his pulses, that in fantasy he pressed the wide\nbeauty of the world in his embracing arms; for all his world resolved\nitself into his heart's best love for Lucy.\n\nNow, crossing the magic silence of the empty chamber, he caught the\nsnow-white bed reflected in the toilet-glass. This rooted him. For one\nswift instant, he seemed to see in that one glance the two separate\nbeds--the real one and the reflected one--and an unbidden, most\nmiserable presentiment thereupon stole into him. But in one breath it\ncame and went. So he advanced, and with a fond and gentle joyfulness,\nhis eye now fell upon the spotless bed itself, and fastened on a\nsnow-white roll that lay beside the pillow. Now he started; Lucy seemed\ncoming in upon him; but no--'tis only the foot of one of her little\nslippers, just peeping into view from under the narrow nether curtains\nof the bed. Then again his glance fixed itself upon the slender,\nsnow-white, ruffled roll; and he stood as one enchanted. Never precious\nparchment of the Greek was half so precious in his eyes. Never\ntrembling scholar longed more to unroll the mystic vellum, than Pierre\nlonged to unroll the sacred secrets of that snow-white, ruffled thing.\nBut his hands touched not any object in that chamber, except the one he\nhad gone thither for.\n\n\"Here is the blue portfolio, Lucy. See, the key hangs to its silver\nlock;--were you not fearful I would open it?--'twas tempting, I must\nconfess.\"\n\n\"Open it!\" said Lucy--\"why, yes, Pierre, yes; what secret thing keep I\nfrom thee? Read me through and through. I am entirely thine. See!\" and\ntossing open the portfolio, all manner of rosy things came floating from\nit, and a most delicate perfume of some invisible essence.\n\n\"Ah! thou holy angel, Lucy!\"\n\n\"Why, Pierre, thou art transfigured; thou now lookest as one who--why,\nPierre?\"\n\n\"As one who had just peeped in at paradise, Lucy; and----\"\n\n\"Again wandering in thy mind, Pierre; no more--Come, you must leave me,\nnow. I am quite rested again. Quick, call my aunt, and leave me. Stay,\nthis evening we are to look over the book of plates from the city, you\nknow. Be early;--go now, Pierre.\"\n\n\"Well, good-bye, till evening, thou height of all delight.\"\n\n\nVII.\n\nAs Pierre drove through the silent village, beneath the vertical shadows\nof the noon-day trees, the sweet chamber scene abandoned him, and the\nmystical face recurred to him, and kept with him. At last, arrived at\nhome, he found his mother absent; so passing straight through the wide\nmiddle hall of the mansion, he descended the piazza on the other ride,\nand wandered away in reveries down to the river bank.\n\nHere one primeval pine-tree had been luckily left standing by the\notherwise unsparing woodmen, who long ago had cleared that meadow. It\nwas once crossing to this noble pine, from a clump of hemlocks far\nacross the river, that Pierre had first noticed the significant fact,\nthat while the hemlock and the pine are trees of equal growth and\nstature, and are so similar in their general aspect, that people unused\nto woods sometimes confound them; and while both trees are proverbially\ntrees of sadness, yet the dark hemlock hath no music in its thoughtful\nboughs; but the gentle pine-tree drops melodious mournfulness.\n\nAt its half-bared roots of sadness, Pierre sat down, and marked the\nmighty bulk and far out-reaching length of one particular root, which,\nstraying down the bank, the storms and rains had years ago exposed.\n\n\"How wide, how strong these roots must spread! Sure, this pine-tree\ntakes powerful hold of this fair earth! Yon bright flower hath not so\ndeep a root. This tree hath outlived a century of that gay flower's\ngenerations, and will outlive a century of them yet to come. This is\nmost sad. Hark, now I hear the pyramidical and numberless, flame-like\ncomplainings of this Eolean pine;--the wind breathes now upon it:--the\nwind,--that is God's breath! Is He so sad? Oh, tree! so mighty thou, so\nlofty, yet so mournful! This is most strange! Hark! as I look up into\nthy high secrecies, oh, tree, the face, the face, peeps down on\nme!--'Art thou Pierre? Come to me'--oh, thou mysterious girl,--what an\nill-matched pendant thou, to that other countenance of sweet Lucy, which\nalso hangs, and first did hang within my heart! Is grief a pendant then\nto pleasantness? Is grief a self-willed guest that _will_ come in? Yet I\nhave never known thee, Grief;--thou art a legend to me. I have known\nsome fiery broils of glorious frenzy; I have oft tasted of revery;\nwhence comes pensiveness; whence comes sadness; whence all delicious\npoetic presentiments;--but thou, Grief! art still a ghost-story to me. I\nknow thee not,--do half disbelieve in thee. Not that I would be without\nmy too little cherished fits of sadness now and then; but God keep me\nfrom thee, thou other shape of far profounder gloom! I shudder at thee!\nThe face!--the face!--forth again from thy high secrecies, oh, tree! the\nface steals down upon me. Mysterious girl! who art thou? by what right\nsnatchest thou thus my deepest thoughts? Take thy thin fingers from\nme;--I am affianced, and not to thee. Leave me!--what share hast thou in\nme? Surely, thou lovest not me?--that were most miserable for thee, and\nme, and Lucy. It can not be. What, _who_ art thou? Oh! wretched\nvagueness--too familiar to me, yet inexplicable,--unknown, utterly\nunknown! I seem to founder in this perplexity. Thou seemest to know\nsomewhat of me, that I know not of myself,--what is it then? If thou\nhast a secret in thy eyes of mournful mystery, out with it; Pierre\ndemands it; what is that thou hast veiled in thee so imperfectly, that I\nseem to see its motion, but not its form? It visibly rustles behind the\nconcealing screen. Now, never into the soul of Pierre, stole there\nbefore, a muffledness like this! If aught really lurks in it, ye\nsovereign powers that claim all my leal worshipings, I conjure ye to\nlift the veil; I must see it face to face. Tread I on a mine, warn me;\nadvance I on a precipice, hold me back; but abandon me to an unknown\nmisery, that it shall suddenly seize me, and possess me, wholly,--that\nye will never do; else, Pierre's fond faith in ye--now clean,\nuntouched--may clean depart; and give me up to be a railing atheist! Ah,\nnow the face departs. Pray heaven it hath not only stolen back, and\nhidden again in thy high secrecies, oh tree! But 'tis\ngone--gone--entirely gone; and I thank God, and I feel joy again; joy,\nwhich I also feel to be my right as man; deprived of joy, I feel I\nshould find cause for deadly feuds with things invisible. Ha! a coat of\niron-mail seems to grow round, and husk me now; and I have heard, that\nthe bitterest winters are foretold by a thicker husk upon the Indian\ncorn; so our old farmers say. But 'tis a dark similitude. Quit thy\nanalogies; sweet in the orator's mouth, bitter in the thinker's belly.\nNow, then, I'll up with my own joyful will; and with my joy's face scare\naway all phantoms:--so, they go; and Pierre is Joy's, and Life's again.\nThou pine-tree!--henceforth I will resist thy too treacherous\npersuasiveness. Thou'lt not so often woo me to thy airy tent, to ponder\non the gloomy rooted stakes that bind it. Hence now I go; and peace be\nwith thee, pine! That blessed sereneness which lurks ever at the heart\nof sadness--mere sadness--and remains when all the rest has gone;--that\nsweet feeling is now mine, and cheaply mine. I am not sorry I was sad, I\nfeel so blessed now. Dearest Lucy!--well, well;--'twill be a pretty time\nwe'll have this evening; there's the book of Flemish prints--that first\nwe must look over; then, second, is Flaxman's Homer--clear-cut outlines,\nyet full of unadorned barbaric nobleness. Then Flaxman's Dante;--Dante!\nNight's and Hell's poet he. No, we will not open Dante. Methinks now the\nface--the face--minds me a little of pensive, sweet Francesca's\nface--or, rather, as it had been Francesca's daughter's face--wafted on\nthe sad dark wind, toward observant Virgil and the blistered Florentine.\nNo, we will not open Flaxman's Dante. Francesca's mournful face is now\nideal to me. Flaxman might evoke it wholly,--make it present in lines of\nmisery--bewitching power. No! I will not open Flaxman's Dante! Damned be\nthe hour I read in Dante! more damned than that wherein Paolo and\nFrancesca read in fatal Launcelot!\"\n\n\n\n\nBOOK III.\n\nTHE PRESENTIMENT AND THE VERIFICATION.\n\n\nI.\n\nThe face, of which Pierre and Lucy so strangely and fearfully hinted,\nwas not of enchanted air; but its mortal lineaments of mournfulness had\nbeen visibly beheld by Pierre. Nor had it accosted him in any privacy;\nor in any lonely byeway; or beneath the white light of the crescent\nmoon; but in a joyous chamber, bright with candles, and ringing with two\nscore women's gayest voices. Out of the heart of mirthfulness, this\nshadow had come forth to him. Encircled by bandelets of light, it had\nstill beamed upon him; vaguely historic and prophetic; backward, hinting\nof some irrevocable sin; forward, pointing to some inevitable ill. One\nof those faces, which now and then appear to man, and without one word\nof speech, still reveal glimpses of some fearful gospel. In natural\nguise, but lit by supernatural light; palpable to the senses, but\ninscrutable to the soul; in their perfectest impression on us, ever\nhovering between Tartarean misery and Paradisaic beauty; such faces,\ncompounded so of hell and heaven, overthrow in us all foregone\npersuasions, and make us wondering children in this world again.\n\nThe face had accosted Pierre some weeks previous to his ride with Lucy\nto the hills beyond Saddle Meadows; and before her arrival for the\nsummer at the village; moreover it had accosted him in a very common\nand homely scene; but this enhanced the wonder.\n\nOn some distant business, with a farmer-tenant, he had been absent from\nthe mansion during the best part of the day, and had but just come home,\nearly of a pleasant moonlight evening, when Dates delivered a message to\nhim from his mother, begging him to come for her about half-past seven\nthat night to Miss Llanyllyn's cottage, in order to accompany her thence\nto that of the two Miss Pennies. At the mention of that last name,\nPierre well knew what he must anticipate. Those elderly and truly pious\nspinsters, gifted with the most benevolent hearts in the world, and at\nmid-age deprived by envious nature of their hearing, seemed to have made\nit a maxim of their charitable lives, that since God had not given them\nany more the power to hear Christ's gospel preached, they would\ntherefore thenceforth do what they could toward practicing it.\nWherefore, as a matter of no possible interest to them now, they\nabstained from church; and while with prayer-books in their hands the\nRev. Mr. Falsgrave's congregation were engaged in worshiping their God,\naccording to the divine behest; the two Miss Pennies, with thread and\nneedle, were hard at work in serving him; making up shirts and gowns for\nthe poor people of the parish. Pierre had heard that they had recently\nbeen at the trouble of organizing a regular society, among the\nneighboring farmers' wives and daughters, to meet twice a month at their\nown house (the Miss Pennies) for the purpose of sewing in concert for\nthe benefit of various settlements of necessitous emigrants, who had\nlately pitched their populous shanties further up the river. But though\nthis enterprise had not been started without previously acquainting Mrs.\nGlendinning of it,--for indeed she was much loved and honored by the\npious spinsters,--and their promise of solid assistance from that\ngracious manorial lady; yet Pierre had not heard that his mother had\nbeen officially invited to preside, or be at all present at the\nsemi-monthly meetings; though he supposed, that far from having any\nscruples against so doing, she would be very glad to associate that way,\nwith the good people of the village.\n\n\"Now, brother Pierre\"--said Mrs. Glendinning, rising from Miss\nLlanyllyn's huge cushioned chair--\"throw my shawl around me; and\ngood-evening to Lucy's aunt.--There, we shall be late.\"\n\nAs they walked along, she added--\"Now, Pierre, I know you are apt to be\na little impatient sometimes, of these sewing scenes; but courage; I\nmerely want to peep in on them; so as to get some inkling of what they\nwould indeed be at; and then my promised benefactions can be better\nselected by me. Besides, Pierre, I could have had Dates escort me, but I\npreferred you; because I want you to know who they are you live among;\nhow many really pretty, and naturally-refined dames and girls you shall\none day be lord of the manor of. I anticipate a rare display of rural\nred and white.\"\n\nCheered by such pleasant promises, Pierre soon found himself leading his\nmother into a room full of faces. The instant they appeared, a\ngratuitous old body, seated with her knitting near the door, squeaked\nout shrilly--\"Ah! dames, dames,--Madam Glendinning!--Master Pierre\nGlendinning!\"\n\nAlmost immediately following this sound, there came a sudden,\nlong-drawn, unearthly, girlish shriek, from the further corner of the\nlong, double room. Never had human voice so affected Pierre before.\nThough he saw not the person from whom it came, and though the voice was\nwholly strange to him, yet the sudden shriek seemed to split its way\nclean through his heart, and leave a yawning gap there. For an instant,\nhe stood bewildered; but started at his mother's voice; her arm being\nstill in his. \"Why do you clutch my arm so, Pierre? You pain me. Pshaw!\nsome one has fainted,--nothing more.\"\n\nInstantly Pierre recovered himself, and affecting to mock at his own\ntrepidation, hurried across the room to offer his services, if such\nwere needed. But dames and maidens had been all beforehand with him; the\nlights were wildly flickering in the air-current made by the flinging\nopen of the casement, near to where the shriek had come. But the climax\nof the tumult was soon past; and presently, upon closing the casement,\nit subsided almost wholly. The elder of the spinster Pennies, advancing\nto Mrs. Glendinning, now gave her to understand, that one of the further\ncrowd of industrious girls present, had been attacked by a sudden, but\nfleeting fit, vaguely imputable to some constitutional disorder or\nother. She was now quite well again. And so the company, one and all,\nseemingly acting upon their natural good-breeding, which in any one at\nbottom, is but delicacy and charity, refrained from all further\ncuriosity; reminded not the girl of what had passed; noted her scarce at\nall; and all needles stitched away as before.\n\nLeaving his mother to speak with whom she pleased, and attend alone to\nher own affairs with the society; Pierre, oblivious now in such a lively\ncrowd, of any past unpleasantness, after some courtly words to the Miss\nPennies,--insinuated into their understandings through a long coiled\ntrumpet, which, when not in use, the spinsters wore, hanging like a\npowder-horn from their girdles:--and likewise, after manifesting the\nprofoundest and most intelligent interest in the mystic mechanism of a\nhuge woolen sock, in course of completion by a spectacled old lady of\nhis more particular acquaintance; after all this had been gone through,\nand something more too tedious to detail, but which occupied him for\nnearly half an hour, Pierre, with a slightly blushing, and imperfectly\nbalanced assurance, advanced toward the further crowd of maidens; where,\nby the light of many a well-snuffed candle, they clubbed all their\nbright contrasting cheeks, like a dense bed of garden tulips. There were\nthe shy and pretty Maries, Marthas, Susans, Betties, Jennies, Nellies;\nand forty more fair nymphs, who skimmed the cream, and made the butter\nof the fat farms of Saddle Meadows.\n\nAssurance is in presence of the assured. Where embarrassments prevail,\nthey affect the most disembarrassed. What wonder, then, that gazing on\nsuch a thick array of wreathing, roguish, half-averted, blushing\nfaces--still audacious in their very embarrassment--Pierre, too, should\nflush a bit, and stammer in his attitudes a little? Youthful love and\ngraciousness were in his heart; kindest words upon his tongue; but there\nhe stood, target for the transfixing glances of those ambushed archers\nof the eye.\n\nBut his abashments last too long; his cheek hath changed from blush to\npallor; what strange thing does Pierre Glendinning see? Behind the first\nclose, busy breast-work of young girls, are several very little stands,\nor circular tables, where sit small groups of twos and threes, sewing in\nsmall comparative solitudes, as it were. They would seem to be the less\nnotable of the rural company; or else, for some cause, they have\nvoluntarily retired into their humble banishment. Upon one of these\npersons engaged at the furthermost and least conspicuous of these little\nstands, and close by a casement, Pierre's glance is palely fixed.\n\nThe girl sits steadily sewing; neither she nor her two companions speak.\nHer eyes are mostly upon her work; but now and then a very close\nobserver would notice that she furtively lifts them, and moves them\nsideways and timidly toward Pierre; and then, still more furtively and\ntimidly toward his lady mother, further off. All the while, her\npreternatural calmness sometimes seems only made to cover the intensest\nstruggle in her bosom. Her unadorned and modest dress is black; fitting\nclose up to her neck, and clasping it with a plain, velvet border. To a\nnice perception, that velvet shows elastically; contracting and\nexpanding, as though some choked, violent thing were risen up there\nwithin from the teeming region of her heart. But her dark, olive cheek\nis without a blush, or sign of any disquietude. So far as this girl lies\nupon the common surface, ineffable composure steeps her. But still, she\nsideways steals the furtive, timid glance. Anon, as yielding to the\nirresistible climax of her concealed emotion, whatever that may be, she\nlifts her whole marvelous countenance into the radiant candlelight, and\nfor one swift instant, that face of supernaturalness unreservedly meets\nPierre's. Now, wonderful loveliness, and a still more wonderful\nloneliness, have with inexplicable implorings, looked up to him from\nthat henceforth immemorial face. There, too, he seemed to see the fair\nground where Anguish had contended with Beauty, and neither being\nconqueror, both had laid down on the field.\n\nRecovering at length from his all too obvious emotion, Pierre turned\naway still farther, to regain the conscious possession of himself. A\nwild, bewildering, and incomprehensible curiosity had seized him, to\nknow something definite of that face. To this curiosity, at the moment,\nhe entirely surrendered himself; unable as he was to combat it, or\nreason with it in the slightest way. So soon as he felt his outward\ncomposure returned to him, he purposed to chat his way behind the\nbreastwork of bright eyes and cheeks, and on some parlor pretense or\nother, hear, if possible, an audible syllable from one whose mere silent\naspect had so potentially moved him. But at length, as with this object\nin mind, he was crossing the room again, he heard his mother's voice,\ngayly calling him away; and turning, saw her shawled and bonneted. He\ncould now make no plausible stay, and smothering the agitation in him,\nhe bowed a general and hurried adieu to the company, and went forth with\nhis mother.\n\nThey had gone some way homeward, in perfect silence, when his mother\nspoke.\n\n\"Well, Pierre, what can it possibly be!\"\n\n\"My God, mother, did you see her then!\"\n\n\"My son!\" cried Mrs. Glendinning, instantly stopping in terror, and\nwithdrawing her arm from Pierre, \"what--what under heaven ails you? This\nis most strange! I but playfully asked, what you were so steadfastly\nthinking of; and here you answer me by the strangest question, in a\nvoice that seems to come from under your great-grandfather's tomb! What,\nin heaven's name, does this mean, Pierre? Why were you so silent, and\nwhy now are you so ill-timed in speaking! Answer me;--explain all\nthis;--_she_--_she_--what _she_ should you be thinking of but Lucy\nTartan?--Pierre, beware, beware! I had thought you firmer in your lady's\nfaith, than such strange behavior as this would seem to hint. Answer me,\nPierre, what may this mean? Come, I hate a mystery; speak, my son.\"\n\nFortunately, this prolonged verbalized wonder in his mother afforded\nPierre time to rally from his double and aggravated astonishment,\nbrought about by first suspecting that his mother also had been struck\nby the strange aspect of the face, and then, having that suspicion so\nviolently beaten back upon him, by her apparently unaffected alarm at\nfinding him in some region of thought wholly unshared by herself at the\ntime.\n\n\"It is nothing--nothing, sister Mary; just nothing at all in the world.\nI believe I was dreaming--sleep-walking, or something of that sort. They\nwere vastly pretty girls there this evening, sister Mary, were they not?\nCome, let us walk on--do, sister mine.\"\n\n\"Pierre, Pierre!--but I will take your arm again;--and have you really\nnothing more to say? were you really wandering, Pierre?\"\n\n\"I swear to you, my dearest mother, that never before in my whole\nexistence, have I so completely gone wandering in my soul, as at that\nvery moment. But it is all over now.\" Then in a less earnest and\nsomewhat playful tone, he added: \"And sister mine, if you know aught of\nthe physical and sanitary authors, you must be aware, that the only\ntreatment for such a case of harmless temporary aberration, is for all\npersons to ignore it in the subject. So no more of this foolishness.\nTalking about it only makes me feel very unpleasantly silly, and there\nis no knowing that it may not bring it back upon me.\"\n\n\"Then by all means, my dear boy, not another word about it. But it's\npassing strange--very, very strange indeed. Well, about that morning\nbusiness; how fared you? Tell me about it.\"\n\n\nII.\n\nSo Pierre, gladly plunging into this welcome current of talk, was\nenabled to attend his mother home without furnishing further cause for\nher concern or wonderment. But not by any means so readily could he\nallay his own concern and wonderment. Too really true in itself, however\nevasive in its effect at the time, was that earnest answer to his\nmother, declaring that never in his whole existence had he been so\nprofoundly stirred. The face haunted him as some imploring, and\nbeauteous, impassioned, ideal Madonna's haunts the morbidly longing and\nenthusiastic, but ever-baffled artist. And ever, as the mystic face thus\nrose before his fancy's sight, another sense was touched in him; the\nlong-drawn, unearthly, girlish shriek pealed through and through his\nsoul; for now he knew the shriek came from the face--such Delphic shriek\ncould only come from such a source. And wherefore that shriek? thought\nPierre. Bodes it ill to the face, or me, or both? How am I changed, that\nmy appearance on any scene should have power to work such woe? But it\nwas mostly the face--the face, that wrought upon him. The shriek seemed\nas incidentally embodied there.\n\nThe emotions he experienced seemed to have taken hold of the deepest\nroots and subtlest fibres of his being. And so much the more that it was\nso subterranean in him, so much the more did he feel its weird\ninscrutableness. What was one unknown, sad-eyed, shrieking girl to him?\nThere must be sad-eyed girls somewhere in the world, and this was only\none of them. And what was the most beautiful sad-eyed girl to him?\nSadness might be beautiful, as well as mirth--he lost himself trying to\nfollow out this tangle. \"I will no more of this infatuation,\" he would\ncry; but forth from regions of irradiated air, the divine beauty and\nimploring sufferings of the face, stole into his view.\n\nHitherto I have ever held but lightly, thought Pierre, all stories of\nghostly mysticalness in man; my creed of this world leads me to believe\nin visible, beautiful flesh, and audible breath, however sweet and\nscented; but only in visible flesh, and audible breath, have I hitherto\nbelieved. But now!--now!--and again he would lose himself in the most\nsurprising and preternatural ponderings, which baffled all the\nintrospective cunning of his mind. Himself was too much for himself. He\nfelt that what he had always before considered the solid land of\nveritable reality, was now being audaciously encroached upon by bannered\narmies of hooded phantoms, disembarking in his soul, as from flotillas\nof specter-boats.\n\nThe terrors of the face were not those of Gorgon; not by repelling\nhideousness did it smite him so; but bewilderingly allured him, by its\nnameless beauty, and its long-suffering, hopeless anguish.\n\nBut he was sensible that this general effect upon him, was also special;\nthe face somehow mystically appealing to his own private and individual\naffections; and by a silent and tyrannic call, challenging him in his\ndeepest moral being, and summoning Truth, Love, Pity, Conscience, to the\nstand. Apex of all wonders! thought Pierre; this indeed almost unmans me\nwith its wonderfulness. Escape the face he could not. Muffling his own\nin his bed-clothes--that did not hide it. Flying from it by sunlight\ndown the meadows, was as vain.\n\nMost miraculous of all to Pierre was the vague impression, that\nsomewhere he had seen traits of the likeness of that face before. But\nwhere, he could not say; nor could he, in the remotest degree, imagine.\nHe was not unaware--for in one or two instances, he had experienced the\nfact--that sometimes a man may see a passing countenance in the street,\nwhich shall irresistibly and magnetically affect him, for a moment, as\nwholly unknown to him, and yet strangely reminiscent of some vague face\nhe has previously encountered, in some fancied time, too, of extreme\ninterest to his life. But not so was it now with Pierre. The face had\nnot perplexed him for a few speculative minutes, and then glided from\nhim, to return no more. It stayed close by him; only--and not\ninvariably--could he repel it, by the exertion of all his resolution and\nself-will. Besides, what of general enchantment lurked in his strange\nsensations, seemed concentringly condensed, and pointed to a spear-head,\nthat pierced his heart with an inexplicable pang, whenever the\nspecializing emotion--to call it so--seized the possession of his\nthoughts, and waved into his visions, a thousand forms of by-gone times,\nand many an old legendary family scene, which he had heard related by\nhis elderly relations, some of them now dead.\n\nDisguising his wild reveries as best he might from the notice of his\nmother, and all other persons of her household, for two days Pierre\nwrestled with his own haunted spirit; and at last, so effectually purged\nit of all weirdnesses, and so effectually regained the general mastery\nof himself, that for a time, life went with him, as though he had never\nbeen stirred so strangely. Once more, the sweet unconditional thought of\nLucy slid wholly into his soul, dislodging thence all such phantom\noccupants. Once more he rode, he walked, he swam, he vaulted; and with\nnew zest threw himself into the glowing practice of all those manly\nexercises, he so dearly loved. It almost seemed in him, that ere\npromising forever to protect, as well as eternally to love, his Lucy, he\nmust first completely invigorate and embrawn himself into the possession\nof such a noble muscular manliness, that he might champion Lucy against\nthe whole physical world.\n\nStill--even before the occasional reappearance of the face to\nhim--Pierre, for all his willful ardor in his gymnasticals and other\ndiversions, whether in-doors or out, or whether by book or foil; still,\nPierre could not but be secretly annoyed, and not a little perplexed, as\nto the motive, which, for the first time in his recollection, had\nimpelled him, not merely to conceal from his mother a singular\ncircumstance in his life (for that, he felt would have been but venial;\nand besides, as will eventually be seen, he could find one particular\nprecedent for it, in his past experience) but likewise, and\nsuperaddedly, to parry, nay, to evade, and, in effect, to return\nsomething alarmingly like a fib, to an explicit question put to him by\nhis mother;--such being the guise, in which part of the conversation\nthey had had that eventful night, now appeared to his fastidious sense.\nHe considered also, that his evasive answer had not pantheistically\nburst from him in a momentary interregnum of self-command. No; his\nmother had made quite a lengthy speech to him; during which he well\nremembered, he had been carefully, though with trepidation, turning over\nin his mind, how best he might recall her from her unwished-for and\nuntimely scent. Why had this been so? Was this his wont? What\ninscrutable thing was it, that so suddenly had seized him, and made him\na falsifyer--ay, a falsifyer and nothing less--to his own\ndearly-beloved, and confiding mother? Here, indeed, was something\nstrange for him; here was stuff for his utmost ethical meditations. But,\nnevertheless, on strict introspection, he felt, that he would not\nwillingly have it otherwise; not willingly would he now undissemble\nhimself in this matter to his mother. Why was this, too? Was this his\nwont? Here, again, was food for mysticism. Here, in imperfect inklings,\ntinglings, presentiments, Pierre began to feel--what all mature men, who\nare Magians, sooner or later know, and more or less assuredly--that not\nalways in our actions, are we our own factors. But this conceit was very\ndim in Pierre; and dimness is ever suspicious and repugnant to us; and\nso, Pierre shrank abhorringly from the infernal catacombs of thought,\ndown into which, this foetal fancy beckoned him. Only this, though in\nsecret, did he cherish; only this, he felt persuaded of; namely, that\nnot for both worlds would he have his mother made a partner to his\nsometime mystic mood.\n\nBut with this nameless fascination of the face upon him, during those\ntwo days that it had first and fully possessed him for its own, did\nperplexed Pierre refrain from that apparently most natural of all\nresources,--boldly seeking out, and returning to the palpable cause, and\nquestioning her, by look or voice, or both together--the mysterious girl\nherself? No; not entirely did Pierre here refrain. But his profound\ncuriosity and interest in the matter--strange as it may seem--did not so\nmuch appear to be embodied in the mournful person of the olive girl, as\nby some radiations from her, embodied in the vague conceits which\nagitated his own soul. _There_, lurked the subtler secret: _that_,\nPierre had striven to tear away. From without, no wonderful effect is\nwrought within ourselves, unless some interior, responding wonder meets\nit. That the starry vault shall surcharge the heart with all rapturous\nmarvelings, is only because we ourselves are greater miracles, and\nsuperber trophies than all the stars in universal space. Wonder\ninterlocks with wonder; and then the confounding feeling comes. No cause\nhave we to fancy, that a horse, a dog, a fowl, ever stand transfixed\nbeneath yon skyey load of majesty. But our soul's arches underfit into\nits; and so, prevent the upper arch from falling on us with\nunsustainable inscrutableness. \"Explain ye my deeper mystery,\" said the\nshepherd Chaldean king, smiting his breast, lying on his back upon the\nplain; \"and then, I will bestow all my wonderings upon ye, ye stately\nstars!\" So, in some sort, with Pierre. Explain thou this strange\nintegral feeling in me myself, he thought--turning upon the fancied\nface--and I will then renounce all other wonders, to gaze wonderingly at\nthee. But thou hast evoked in me profounder spells than the evoking one,\nthou face! For me, thou hast uncovered one infinite, dumb, beseeching\ncountenance of mystery, underlying all the surfaces of visible time and\nspace.\n\nBut during those two days of his first wild vassalage to his original\nsensations, Pierre had not been unvisited by less mysterious impulses.\nTwo or three very plain and practical plannings of desirable procedures\nin reference to some possible homely explication of all this\nnonsense--so he would momentarily denominate it--now and then flittingly\nintermitted his pervading mood of semi-madness. Once he had seized his\nhat, careless of his accustomed gloves and cane, and found himself in\nthe street, walking very rapidly in the direction of the Miss Pennies'.\nBut whither now? he disenchantingly interrogated himself. Where would\nyou go? A million to one, those deaf old spinsters can tell you nothing\nyou burn to know. Deaf old spinsters are not used to be the depositaries\nof such mystical secrecies. But then, they may reveal her name--where\nshe dwells, and something, however fragmentary and unsatisfactory, of\nwho she is, and whence. Ay; but then, in ten minutes after your leaving\nthem, all the houses in Saddle Meadows would be humming with the gossip\nof Pierre Glendinning engaged to marry Lucy Tartan, and yet running\nabout the country, in ambiguous pursuit of strange young women. That\nwill never do. You remember, do you not, often seeing the Miss Pennies,\nhatless and without a shawl, hurrying through the village, like two\npostmen intent on dropping some tit-bit of precious gossip? What a\nmorsel for them, Pierre, have you, if you now call upon them. Verily,\ntheir trumpets are both for use and for significance. Though very deaf,\nthe Miss Pennies are by no means dumb. They blazon very wide.\n\n\"Now be sure, and say that it was the Miss Pennies, who left the\nnews--be sure--we--the Miss Pennies--remember--say to Mrs. Glendinning\nit was we.\" Such was the message that now half-humorously occurred to\nPierre, as having been once confided to him by the sister spinsters, one\nevening when they called with a choice present of some very _recherche_\nchit-chat for his mother; but found the manorial lady out; and so\ncharged her son with it; hurrying away to all the inferior houses, so as\nnot to be anywhere forestalled in their disclosure.\n\nNow, I wish it had been any other house than the Miss Pennies; any other\nhouse but theirs, and on my soul I believe I should have gone. But not\nto them--no, that I can not do. It would be sure to reach my mother, and\nthen she would put this and that together--stir a little--let it\nsimmer--and farewell forever to all her majestic notions of my\nimmaculate integrity. Patience, Pierre, the population of this region is\nnot so immense. No dense mobs of Nineveh confound all personal\nidentities in Saddle Meadows. Patience; thou shalt see it soon again;\ncatch it passing thee in some green lane, sacred to thy evening\nreveries. She that bears it can not dwell remote. Patience, Pierre. Ever\nare such mysteries best and soonest unraveled by the eventual unraveling\nof themselves. Or, if you will, go back and get your gloves, and more\nespecially your cane, and begin your own secret voyage of discovery\nafter it. Your cane, I say; because it will probably be a very long and\nweary walk. True, just now I hinted, that she that bears it can not\ndwell very remote; but then her nearness may not be at all conspicuous.\nSo, homeward, and put off thy hat, and let thy cane stay still, good\nPierre. Seek not to mystify the mystery so.\n\nThus, intermittingly, ever and anon during those sad two days of\ndeepest sufferance, Pierre would stand reasoning and expostulating with\nhimself; and by such meditative treatment, reassure his own spontaneous\nimpulses. Doubtless, it was wise and right that so he did; doubtless:\nbut in a world so full of all dubieties as this, one can never be\nentirely certain whether another person, however carefully and\ncautiously conscientious, has acted in all respects conceivable for the\nvery best.\n\nBut when the two days were gone by, and Pierre began to recognize his\nformer self as restored to him from its mystic exile, then the thoughts\nof personally and pointedly seeking out the unknown, either\npreliminarily by a call upon the sister spinsters, or generally by\nperforming the observant lynx-eyed circuit of the country on foot, and\nas a crafty inquisitor, dissembling his cause of inquisition; these and\nall similar intentions completely abandoned Pierre.\n\nHe was now diligently striving, with all his mental might, forever to\ndrive the phantom from him. He seemed to feel that it begat in him a\ncertain condition of his being, which was most painful, and every way\nuncongenial to his natural, wonted self. It had a touch of he knew not\nwhat sort of unhealthiness in it, so to speak; for, in his then\nignorance, he could find no better term; it seemed to have in it a germ\nof somewhat which, if not quickly extirpated, might insidiously poison\nand embitter his whole life--that choice, delicious life which he had\nvowed to Lucy for his one pure and comprehensive offering--at once a\nsacrifice and a delight.\n\nNor in these endeavorings did he entirely fail. For the most part, he\nfelt now that he had a power over the comings and the goings of the\nface; but not on all occasions. Sometimes the old, original mystic\ntyranny would steal upon him; the long, dark, locks of mournful hair\nwould fall upon his soul, and trail their wonderful melancholy along\nwith them; the two full, steady, over-brimming eyes of loveliness and\nanguish would converge their magic rays, till he felt them kindling he\ncould not tell what mysterious fires in the heart at which they aimed.\n\nWhen once this feeling had him fully, then was the perilous time for\nPierre. For supernatural as the feeling was, and appealing to all things\nultramontane to his soul; yet was it a delicious sadness to him. Some\nhazy fairy swam above him in the heavenly ether, and showered down upon\nhim the sweetest pearls of pensiveness. Then he would be seized with a\nsingular impulse to reveal the secret to some one other individual in\nthe world. Only one, not more; he could not hold all this strange\nfullness in himself. It must be shared. In such an hour it was, that\nchancing to encounter Lucy (her, whom above all others, he did\nconfidingly adore), she heard the story of the face; nor slept at all\nthat night; nor for a long time freed her pillow completely from wild,\nBeethoven sounds of distant, waltzing melodies, as of ambiguous fairies\ndancing on the heath.\n\n\nIII.\n\nThis history goes forward and goes backward, as occasion calls. Nimble\ncenter, circumference elastic you must have. Now we return to Pierre,\nwending homeward from his reveries beneath the pine-tree.\n\nHis burst of impatience against the sublime Italian, Dante, arising from\nthat poet being the one who, in a former time, had first opened to his\nshuddering eyes the infinite cliffs and gulfs of human mystery and\nmisery;--though still more in the way of experimental vision, than of\nsensational presentiment or experience (for as yet he had not seen so\nfar and deep as Dante, and therefore was entirely incompetent to meet\nthe grim bard fairly on his peculiar ground), this ignorant burst of\nhis young impatience,--also arising from that half contemptuous dislike,\nand sometimes selfish loathing, with which, either naturally feeble or\nundeveloped minds, regard those dark ravings of the loftier poets, which\nare in eternal opposition to their own fine-spun, shallow dreams of\nrapturous or prudential Youth;--this rash, untutored burst of Pierre's\nyoung impatience, seemed to have carried off with it, all the other\nforms of his melancholy--if melancholy it had been--and left him now\nserene again, and ready for any tranquil pleasantness the gods might\nhave in store. For his, indeed, was true Youth's temperament,--summary\nwith sadness, swift to joyfulness, and long protracting, and detaining\nwith that joyfulness, when once it came fully nigh to him.\n\nAs he entered the dining-hall, he saw Dates retiring from another door\nwith his tray. Alone and meditative, by the bared half of the polished\ntable, sat his mother at her dessert; fruit-baskets, and a decanter were\nbefore her. On the other leaf of the same table, still lay the cloth,\nfolded back upon itself, and set out with one plate and its usual\naccompaniments.\n\n\"Sit down, Pierre; when I came home, I was surprised to hear that the\nphaeton had returned so early, and here I waited dinner for you, until I\ncould wait no more. But go to the green pantry now, and get what Dates\nhas but just put away for you there. Heigh-ho! too plainly I foresee\nit--no more regular dinner-hours, or tea-hours, or supper-hours, in\nSaddle Meadows, till its young lord is wedded. And that puts me in mind\nof something, Pierre; but I'll defer it till you have eaten a little. Do\nyou know, Pierre, that if you continue these irregular meals of yours,\nand deprive me so entirely almost of your company, that I shall run\nfearful risk of getting to be a terrible wine-bibber;--yes, could you\nunalarmed see me sitting all alone here with this decanter, like any old\nnurse, Pierre; some solitary, forlorn old nurse, Pierre, deserted by her\nlast friend, and therefore forced to embrace her flask?\"\n\n\"No, I did not feel any great alarm, sister,\" said Pierre, smiling,\n\"since I could not but perceive that the decanter was still full to the\nstopple.\"\n\n\"Possibly it may be only a fresh decanter, Pierre;\" then changing her\nvoice suddenly--\"but mark me, Mr. Pierre Glendinning!\"\n\n\"Well, Mrs. Mary Glendinning!\"\n\n\"Do you know, sir, that you are very shortly to be married,--that indeed\nthe day is all but fixed?\"\n\n\"How-!\" cried Pierre, in real joyful astonishment, both at the nature of\nthe tidings, and the earnest tones in which they were conveyed--\"dear,\ndear mother, you have strangely changed your mind then, my dear mother.\"\n\n\"It is even so, dear brother;--before this day month I hope to have a\nlittle sister Tartan.\"\n\n\"You talk very strangely, mother,\" rejoined Pierre, quickly. \"I suppose,\nthen, I have next to nothing to say in the matter!\"\n\n\"Next to nothing, Pierre! What indeed could you say to the purpose? what\nat all have you to do with it, I should like to know? Do you so much as\ndream, you silly boy, that men ever have the marrying of themselves?\nJuxtaposition marries men. There is but one match-maker in the world,\nPierre, and that is Mrs. Juxtaposition, a most notorious lady!\"\n\n\"Very peculiar, disenchanting sort of talk, this, under the\ncircumstances, sister Mary,\" laying down his fork. \"Mrs. Juxtaposition,\nah! And in your opinion, mother, does this fine glorious passion only\namount to that?\"\n\n\"Only to that, Pierre; but mark you: according to my creed--though this\npart of it is a little hazy--Mrs. Juxtaposition moves her pawns only as\nshe herself is moved to so doing by the spirit.\"\n\n\"Ah! that sets it all right again,\" said Pierre, resuming his fork--\"my\nappetite returns. But what was that about my being married so soon?\" he\nadded, vainly striving to assume an air of incredulity and unconcern;\n\"you were joking, I suppose; it seems to me, sister, either you or I was\nbut just now wandering in the mind a little, on that subject. Are you\nreally thinking of any such thing? and have you really vanquished your\nsagacious scruples by yourself, after I had so long and ineffectually\nsought to do it for you? Well, I am a million times delighted; tell me\nquick!\"\n\n\"I will, Pierre. You very well know, that from the first hour you\napprised me--or rather, from a period prior to that--from the moment\nthat I, by my own insight, became aware of your love for Lucy, I have\nalways approved it. Lucy is a delicious girl; of honorable descent, a\nfortune, well-bred, and the very pattern of all that I think amiable and\nattractive in a girl of seventeen.\"\n\n\"Well, well, well,\" cried Pierre rapidly and impetuously; \"we both knew\nthat before.\"\n\n\"Well, well, well, Pierre,\" retorted his mother, mockingly.\n\n\"It is not well, well, well; but ill, ill, ill, to torture me so,\nmother; go on, do!\"\n\n\"But notwithstanding my admiring approval of your choice, Pierre; yet,\nas you know, I have resisted your entreaties for my consent to your\nspeedy marriage, because I thought that a girl of scarcely seventeen,\nand a boy scarcely twenty, should not be in such a hurry;--there was\nplenty of time, I thought, which could be profitably employed by both.\"\n\n\"Permit me here to interrupt you, mother. Whatever you may have seen in\nme; she,--I mean Lucy,--has never been in the slightest hurry to be\nmarried;--that's all. But I shall regard it as a _lapsus-lingua_ in\nyou.\"\n\n\"Undoubtedly, a _lapsus_. But listen to me. I have been carefully\nobserving both you and Lucy of late; and that has made me think further\nof the matter. Now, Pierre, if you were in any profession, or in any\nbusiness at all; nay, if I were a farmer's wife, and you my child,\nworking in my fields; why, then, you and Lucy should still wait awhile.\nBut as you have nothing to do but to think of Lucy by day, and dream of\nher by night, and as she is in the same predicament, I suppose; with\nrespect to you; and as the consequence of all this begins to be\ndiscernible in a certain, just perceptible, and quite harmless thinness,\nso to speak, of the cheek; but a very conspicuous and dangerous\nfebrileness of the eye; therefore, I choose the lesser of two evils; and\nnow you have my permission to be married, as soon as the thing can be\ndone with propriety. I dare say you have no objection to have the\nwedding take place before Christmas, the present month being the first\nof summer.\"\n\nPierre said nothing; but leaping to his feet, threw his two arms around\nhis mother, and kissed her repeatedly.\n\n\"A most sweet and eloquent answer, Pierre; but sit down again. I desire\nnow to say a little concerning less attractive, but quite necessary\nthings connected with this affair. You know, that by your father's will,\nthese lands and--\"\n\n\"Miss Lucy, my mistress;\" said Dates, throwing open the door.\n\nPierre sprang to his feet; but as if suddenly mindful of his mother's\npresence, composed himself again, though he still approached the door.\n\nLucy entered, carrying a little basket of strawberries.\n\n\"Why, how do you do, my dear,\" said Mrs. Glendinning affectionately.\n\"This is an unexpected pleasure.\"\n\n\"Yes; and I suppose that Pierre here is a little surprised too; seeing\nthat he was to call upon me this evening, and not I upon him before\nsundown. But I took a sudden fancy for a solitary stroll,--the afternoon\nwas such a delicious one; and chancing--it was only chancing--to pass\nthrough the Locust Lane leading hither, I met the strangest little\nfellow, with this basket in his hand.--'Yes, buy them, miss'--said he.\n'And how do you know I want to buy them,' returned I, 'I don't want to\nbuy them.'--'Yes you do, miss; they ought to be twenty-six cents, but\nI'll take thirteen cents, that being my shilling. I always want the odd\nhalf cent, I do. Come, I can't wait, I have been expecting you long\nenough.'\"\n\n\"A very sagacious little imp,\" laughed Mrs. Glendinning.\n\n\"Impertinent little rascal,\" cried Pierre.\n\n\"And am I not now the silliest of all silly girls, to be telling you my\nadventures so very frankly,\" smiled Lucy.\n\n\"No; but the most celestial of all innocents,\" cried Pierre, in a\nrhapsody of delight. \"Frankly open is the flower, that hath nothing but\npurity to show.\"\n\n\"Now, my dear little Lucy,\" said Mrs. Glendinning, \"let Pierre take off\nyour shawl, and come now and stay to tea with us. Pierre has put back\nthe dinner so, the tea-hour will come now very soon.\"\n\n\"Thank you; but I can not stay this time. Look, I have forgotten my own\nerrand; I brought these strawberries for you, Mrs. Glendinning, and for\nPierre;--Pierre is so wonderfully fond of them.\"\n\n\"I was audacious enough to think as much,\" cried Pierre, \"for you _and_\nme, you see, mother; for you _and_ me, you understand that, I hope.\"\n\n\"Perfectly, my dear brother.\"\n\nLucy blushed.\n\n\"How warm it is, Mrs. Glendinning.\"\n\n\"Very warm, Lucy. So you won't stay to tea?\"\n\n\"No, I must go now; just a little stroll, that's all; good-bye! Now\ndon't be following me, Pierre. Mrs. Glendinning, will you keep Pierre\nback? I know you want him; you were talking over some private affair\nwhen I entered; you both looked so very confidential.\"\n\n\"And you were not very far from right, Lucy,\" said Mrs. Glendinning,\nmaking no sign to stay her departure.\n\n\"Yes, business of the highest importance,\" said Pierre, fixing his eyes\nupon Lucy significantly.\n\nAt this moment, Lucy just upon the point of her departure, was hovering\nnear the door; the setting sun, streaming through the window, bathed her\nwhole form in golden loveliness and light; that wonderful, and most\nvivid transparency of her clear Welsh complexion, now fairly glowed like\nrosy snow. Her flowing, white, blue-ribboned dress, fleecily invested\nher. Pierre almost thought that she could only depart the house by\nfloating out of the open window, instead of actually stepping from the\ndoor. All her aspect to him, was that moment touched with an\nindescribable gayety, buoyancy, fragility, and an unearthly evanescence.\n\nYouth is no philosopher. Not into young Pierre's heart did there then\ncome the thought, that as the glory of the rose endures but for a day,\nso the full bloom of girlish airiness and bewitchingness, passes from\nthe earth almost as soon; as jealously absorbed by those frugal\nelements, which again incorporate that translated girlish bloom, into\nthe first expanding flower-bud. Not into young Pierre, did there then\nsteal that thought of utmost sadness; pondering on the inevitable\nevanescence of all earthly loveliness; which makes the sweetest things\nof life only food for ever-devouring and omnivorous melancholy. Pierre's\nthought was different from this, and yet somehow akin to it.\n\nThis to be my wife? I that but the other day weighed an hundred and\nfifty pounds of solid avoirdupois;--_I_ to wed this heavenly fleece?\nMethinks one husbandly embrace would break her airy zone, and she exhale\nupward to that heaven whence she hath hither come, condensed to mortal\nsight. It can not be; I am of heavy earth, and she of airy light. By\nheaven, but marriage is an impious thing!\n\nMeanwhile, as these things ran through his soul, Mrs. Glendinning also\nhad thinkings of her own.\n\n\"A very beautiful tableau,\" she cried, at last, artistically turning her\ngay head a little sideways--\"very beautiful, indeed; this, I suppose is\nall premeditated for my entertainment. Orpheus finding his Eurydice; or\nPluto stealing Proserpine. Admirable! It might almost stand for either.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Pierre, gravely; \"it is the last. Now, first I see a meaning\nthere.\" Yes, he added to himself inwardly, I am Pluto stealing\nProserpine; and every accepted lover is.\n\n\"And you would be very stupid, brother Pierre, if you did not see\nsomething there,\" said his mother, still that way pursuing her own\ndifferent train of thought. \"The meaning thereof is this: Lucy has\ncommanded me to stay you; but in reality she wants you to go along with\nher. Well, you may go as far as the porch; but then, you must return,\nfor we have not concluded our little affair, you know. Adieu, little\nlady!\"\n\nThere was ever a slight degree of affectionate patronizing in the manner\nof the resplendent, full-blown Mrs. Glendinning, toward the delicate and\nshrinking girlhood of young Lucy. She treated her very much as she might\nhave treated some surpassingly beautiful and precocious child; and this\nwas precisely what Lucy was. Looking beyond the present period, Mrs.\nGlendinning could not but perceive, that even in Lucy's womanly\nmaturity, Lucy would still be a child to her; because, she, elated,\nfelt, that in a certain intellectual vigor, so to speak, she was the\nessential opposite of Lucy, whose sympathetic mind and person had both\nbeen cast in one mould of wondrous delicacy. But here Mrs. Glendinning\nwas both right and wrong. So far as she here saw a difference between\nherself and Lucy Tartan, she did not err; but so far--and that was very\nfar--as she thought she saw her innate superiority to her in the\nabsolute scale of being, here she very widely and immeasurably erred.\nFor what may be artistically styled angelicalness, this is the highest\nessence compatible with created being; and angelicalness hath no vulgar\nvigor in it. And that thing which very often prompts to the display of\nany vigor--which thing, in man or woman, is at bottom nothing but\nambition--this quality is purely earthly, and not angelical. It is\nfalse, that any angels fell by reason of ambition. Angels never fall;\nand never feel ambition. Therefore, benevolently, and affectionately,\nand all-sincerely, as thy heart, oh, Mrs. Glendinning! now standest\naffected toward the fleecy Lucy; still, lady, thou dost very sadly\nmistake it, when the proud, double-arches of the bright breastplate of\nthy bosom, expand with secret triumph over one, whom thou so sweetly,\nbut still so patronizingly stylest, The Little Lucy.\n\nBut ignorant of these further insights, that very superb-looking lady,\nnow waiting Pierre's return from the portico door, sat in a very\nmatronly revery; her eyes fixed upon the decanter of amber-hued wine\nbefore her. Whether it was that she somehow saw some lurking analogical\nsimilitude between that remarkably slender, and gracefully cut little\npint-decanter, brimfull of light, golden wine, or not, there is no\nabsolute telling now. But really, the peculiarly, and reminiscently, and\nforecastingly complacent expression of her beaming and benevolent\ncountenance, seemed a tell-tale of some conceit very much like the\nfollowing:--Yes, she's a very pretty little pint-decanter of a girl: a\nvery pretty little Pale Sherry pint-decanter of a girl; and I--I'm a\nquart decanter of--of--Port--potent Port! Now, Sherry for boys, and Port\nfor men--so I've heard men say; and Pierre is but a boy; but when his\nfather wedded me,--why, his father was turned of five-and-thirty years.\n\nAfter a little further waiting for him, Mrs. Glendinning heard Pierre's\nvoice--\"Yes, before eight o'clock at least, Lucy--no fear;\" and then the\nhall door banged, and Pierre returned to her.\n\nBut now she found that this unforeseen visit of Lucy had completely\nrouted all business capacity in her mercurial son; fairly capsizing him\nagain into, there was no telling what sea of pleasant pensiveness.\n\n\"Dear me! some other time, sister Mary.\"\n\n\"Not this time; that is very certain, Pierre. Upon my word I shall have\nto get Lucy kidnapped, and temporarily taken out of the country, and you\nhandcuffed to the table, else there will be no having a preliminary\nunderstanding with you, previous to calling in the lawyers. Well, I\nshall yet manage you, one way or other. Good-bye, Pierre; I see you\ndon't want me now. I suppose I shan't see you till to-morrow morning.\nLuckily, I have a very interesting book to read. Adieu!\"\n\nBut Pierre remained in his chair; his gaze fixed upon the stilly sunset\nbeyond the meadows, and far away to the now golden hills. A glorious,\nsoftly glorious, and most gracious evening, which seemed plainly a\ntongue to all humanity, saying: I go down in beauty to rise in joy; Love\nreigns throughout all worlds that sunsets visit; it is a foolish ghost\nstory; there is no such thing as misery. Would Love, which is\nomnipotent, have misery in his domain? Would the god of sunlight decree\ngloom? It is a flawless, speckless, fleckless, beautiful world\nthroughout; joy now, and joy forever!\n\nThen the face, which before had seemed mournfully and reproachfully\nlooking out upon him from the effulgent sunset's heart; the face slid\nfrom him; and left alone there with his soul's joy, thinking that that\nvery night he would utter the magic word of marriage to his Lucy; not a\nhappier youth than Pierre Glendinning sat watching that day's sun go\ndown.\n\n\nIV.\n\nAfter this morning of gayety, this noon of tragedy, and this evening so\nfull of chequered pensiveness; Pierre now possessed his soul in joyful\nmildness and steadfastness; feeling none of that wild anguish of\nanticipative rapture, which, in weaker minds, too often dislodges Love's\nsweet bird from her nest.\n\nThe early night was warm, but dark--for the moon was not risen yet--and\nas Pierre passed on beneath the pendulous canopies of the long arms of\nthe weeping elms of the village, an almost impenetrable blackness\nsurrounded him, but entered not the gently illuminated halls of his\nheart. He had not gone very far, when in the distance beyond, he noticed\na light moving along the opposite side of the road, and slowly\napproaching. As it was the custom for some of the more elderly, and\nperhaps timid inhabitants of the village, to carry a lantern when going\nabroad of so dark a night, this object conveyed no impression of novelty\nto Pierre; still, as it silently drew nearer and nearer, the one only\ndistinguishable thing before him, he somehow felt a nameless\npresentiment that the light must be seeking him. He had nearly gained\nthe cottage door, when the lantern crossed over toward him; and as his\nnimble hand was laid at last upon the little wicket-gate, which he\nthought was now to admit him to so much delight; a heavy hand was laid\nupon himself, and at the same moment, the lantern was lifted toward his\nface, by a hooded and obscure-looking figure, whose half-averted\ncountenance he could but indistinctly discern. But Pierre's own open\naspect, seemed to have been quickly scrutinized by the other.\n\n\"I have a letter for Pierre Glendinning,\" said the stranger, \"and I\nbelieve this is he.\" At the same moment, a letter was drawn forth, and\nsought his hand.\n\n\"For me!\" exclaimed Pierre, faintly, starting at the strangeness of the\nencounter;--\"methinks this is an odd time and place to deliver your\nmail;--who are you?--Stay!\"\n\nBut without waiting an answer, the messenger had already turned about,\nand was re-crossing the road. In the first impulse of the moment, Pierre\nstept forward, and would have pursued him; but smiling at his own\ncauseless curiosity and trepidation, paused again; and softly turned\nover the letter in his hand. What mysterious correspondent is this,\nthought he, circularly moving his thumb upon the seal; no one writes me\nbut from abroad; and their letters come through the office; and as for\nLucy--pooh!--when she herself is within, she would hardly have her notes\ndelivered at her own gate. Strange! but I'll in, and read it;--no, not\nthat;--I come to read again in her own sweet heart--that dear missive to\nme from heaven,--and this impertinent letter would pre-occupy me. I'll\nwait till I go home.\n\nHe entered the gate, and laid his hand upon the cottage knocker. Its\nsudden coolness caused a slight, and, at any other time, an\nunaccountable sympathetic sensation in his hand. To his unwonted mood,\nthe knocker seemed to say--\"Enter not!--Begone, and first read thy\nnote.\"\n\nYielding now, half alarmed, and half bantering with himself, to these\nshadowy interior monitions, he half-unconsciously quitted the door;\nrepassed the gate; and soon found himself retracing his homeward path.\n\nHe equivocated with himself no more; the gloom of the air had now burst\ninto his heart, and extinguished its light; then, first in all his life,\nPierre felt the irresistible admonitions and intuitions of Fate.\n\nHe entered the hall unnoticed, passed up to his chamber, and hurriedly\nlocking the door in the dark, lit his lamp. As the summoned flame\nilluminated the room, Pierre, standing before the round center-table,\nwhere the lamp was placed, with his hand yet on the brass circle which\nregulated the wick, started at a figure in the opposite mirror. It bore\nthe outline of Pierre, but now strangely filled with features\ntransformed, and unfamiliar to him; feverish eagerness, fear, and\nnameless forebodings of ill! He threw himself into a chair, and for a\ntime vainly struggled with the incomprehensible power that possessed\nhim. Then, as he avertedly drew the letter from his bosom, he whispered\nto himself--Out on thee, Pierre! how sheepish now will ye feel when this\ntremendous note will turn out to be an invitation to a supper to-morrow\nnight; quick, fool, and write the stereotyped reply: Mr. Pierre\nGlendinning will be very happy to accept Miss so and so's polite\ninvitation.\n\nStill for the moment he held the letter averted. The messenger had so\nhurriedly accosted him, and delivered his duty, that Pierre had not yet\nso much as gained one glance at the superscription of the note. And now\nthe wild thought passed through his mind of what would be the result,\nshould he deliberately destroy the note, without so much as looking at\nthe hand that had addressed it. Hardly had this half-crazy conceit fully\nmade itself legible in his soul, when he was conscious of his two hands\nmeeting in the middle of the sundered note! He leapt from his chair--By\nheaven! he murmured, unspeakably shocked at the intensity of that mood\nwhich had caused him unwittingly as it were, to do for the first time in\nhis whole life, an act of which he was privately ashamed. Though the\nmood that was on him was none of his own willful seeking; yet now he\nswiftly felt conscious that he had perhaps a little encouraged it,\nthrough that certain strange infatuation of fondness, which the human\nmind, however vigorous, sometimes feels for any emotion at once novel\nand mystical. Not willingly, at such times--never mind how fearful we\nmay be--do we try to dissolve the spell which seems, for the time, to\nadmit us, all astonished, into the vague vestibule of the spiritual\nworlds.\n\nPierre now seemed distinctly to feel two antagonistic agencies within\nhim; one of which was just struggling into his consciousness, and each\nof which was striving for the mastery; and between whose respective\nfinal ascendencies, he thought he could perceive, though but shadowly,\nthat he himself was to be the only umpire. One bade him finish the\nselfish destruction of the note; for in some dark way the reading of it\nwould irretrievably entangle his fate. The other bade him dismiss all\nmisgivings; not because there was no possible ground for them, but\nbecause to dismiss them was the manlier part, never mind what might\nbetide. This good angel seemed mildly to say--Read, Pierre, though by\nreading thou may'st entangle thyself, yet may'st thou thereby\ndisentangle others. Read, and feel that best blessedness which, with the\nsense of all duties discharged, holds happiness indifferent. The bad\nangel insinuatingly breathed--Read it not, dearest Pierre; but destroy\nit, and be happy. Then, at the blast of his noble heart, the bad angel\nshrunk up into nothingness; and the good one defined itself clearer and\nmore clear, and came nigher and more nigh to him, smiling sadly but\nbenignantly; while forth from the infinite distances wonderful harmonies\nstole into his heart; so that every vein in him pulsed to some heavenly\nswell.\n\n\nV.\n\n\"The name at the end of this letter will be wholly strange to thee.\nHitherto my existence has been utterly unknown to thee. This letter will\ntouch thee and pain thee. Willingly would I spare thee, but I can not.\nMy heart bears me witness, that did I think that the suffering these\nlines would give thee, would, in the faintest degree, compare with what\nmine has been, I would forever withhold them.\n\n\"Pierre Glendinning, thou art not the only child of thy father; in the\neye of the sun, the hand that traces this is thy sister's; yes, Pierre,\nIsabel calls thee her brother--her brother! oh, sweetest of words, which\nso often I have thought to myself, and almost deemed it profanity for an\noutcast like me to speak or think. Dearest Pierre, my brother, my own\nfather's child! art thou an angel, that thou canst overleap all the\nheartless usages and fashions of a banded world, that will call thee\nfool, fool, fool! and curse thee, if thou yieldest to that heavenly\nimpulse which alone can lead thee to respond to the long tyrannizing,\nand now at last unquenchable yearnings of my bursting heart? Oh, my\nbrother!\n\n\"But, Pierre Glendinning, I will be proud with thee. Let not my hapless\ncondition extinguish in me, the nobleness which I equally inherit with\nthee. Thou shall not be cozened, by my tears and my anguish, into any\nthing which thy most sober hour will repent. Read no further. If it suit\nthee, burn this letter; so shalt thou escape the certainty of that\nknowledge, which, if thou art now cold and selfish, may hereafter, in\nsome maturer, remorseful, and helpless hour, cause thee a poignant\nupbraiding. No, I shall not, I will not implore thee.--Oh, my brother,\nmy dear, dear Pierre,--help me, fly to me; see, I perish without\nthee;--pity, pity,--here I freeze in the wide, wide world;--no father,\nno mother, no sister, no brother, no living thing in the fair form of\nhumanity, that holds me dear. No more, oh no more, dear Pierre, can I\nendure to be an outcast in the world, for which the dear Savior died.\nFly to me, Pierre;--nay, I could tear what I now write,--as I have torn\nso many other sheets, all written for thy eye, but which never reached\nthee, because in my distraction, I knew not how to write to thee, nor\nwhat to say to thee; and so, behold again how I rave.\n\n\"Nothing more; I will write no more;--silence becomes this grave;--the\nheart-sickness steals over me, Pierre, my brother.\n\n\"Scarce know I what I have written. Yet will I write thee the fatal\nline, and leave all the rest to thee, Pierre, my brother.--She that is\ncalled Isabel Banford dwells in the little red farm-house, three miles\nfrom the village, on the slope toward the lake. To-morrow\nnight-fall--not before--not by day, not by day, Pierre.\n\nTHY SISTER, ISABEL.\"\n\n\nVI.\n\nThis letter, inscribed in a feminine, but irregular hand, and in some\nplaces almost illegible, plainly attesting the state of the mind which\nhad dictated it;--stained, too, here and there, with spots of tears,\nwhich chemically acted upon by the ink, assumed a strange and reddish\nhue--as if blood and not tears had dropped upon the sheet;--and so\ncompletely torn in two by Pierre's own hand, that it indeed seemed the\nfit scroll of a torn, as well as bleeding heart;--this amazing letter,\ndeprived Pierre for the time of all lucid and definite thought or\nfeeling. He hung half-lifeless in his chair; his hand, clutching the\nletter, was pressed against his heart, as if some assassin had stabbed\nhim and fled; and Pierre was now holding the dagger in the wound, to\nstanch the outgushing of the blood.\n\nAy, Pierre, now indeed art thou hurt with a wound, never to be\ncompletely healed but in heaven; for thee, the before undistrusted moral\nbeauty of the world is forever fled; for thee, thy sacred father is no\nmore a saint; all brightness hath gone from thy hills, and all peace\nfrom thy plains; and now, now, for the first time, Pierre, Truth rolls a\nblack billow through thy soul! Ah, miserable thou, to whom Truth, in her\nfirst tides, bears nothing but wrecks!\n\nThe perceptible forms of things; the shapes of thoughts; the pulses of\nlife, but slowly came back to Pierre. And as the mariner, shipwrecked\nand cast on the beach, has much ado to escape the recoil of the wave\nthat hurled him there; so Pierre long struggled, and struggled, to\nescape the recoil of that anguish, which had dashed him out of itself,\nupon the beach of his swoon.\n\nBut man was not made to succumb to the villain Woe. Youth is not young\nand a wrestler in vain. Pierre staggeringly rose to his feet; his wide\neyes fixed, and his whole form in a tremble.\n\n\"Myself am left, at least,\" he slowly and half-chokingly murmured. \"With\nmyself I front thee! Unhand me all fears, and unlock me all spells!\nHenceforth I will know nothing but Truth; glad Truth, or sad Truth; I\nwill know what is, and do what my deepest angel dictates.--The\nletter!--Isabel,--sister,--brother,--me, _me_--my sacred father!--This\nis some accursed dream!--nay, but this paper thing is forged,--a base\nand malicious forgery, I swear;--Well didst thou hide thy face from me,\nthou vile lanterned messenger, that didst accost me on the threshold of\nJoy, with this lying warrant of Woe! Doth Truth come in the dark, and\nsteal on us, and rob us so, and then depart, deaf to all pursuing\ninvocations? If this night, which now wraps my soul, be genuine as that\nwhich now wraps this half of the world; then Fate, I have a choice\nquarrel with thee. Thou art a palterer and a cheat; thou hast lured me\non through gay gardens to a gulf. Oh! falsely guided in the days of my\nJoy, am I now truly led in this night of my grief?--I will be a raver,\nand none shall stay me! I will lift my hand in fury, for am I not\nstruck? I will be bitter in my breath, for is not this cup of gall? Thou\nBlack Knight, that with visor down, thus confrontest me, and mockest at\nme; Lo! I strike through thy helm, and will see thy face, be it\nGorgon!--Let me go, ye fond affections; all piety leave me;--I will be\nimpious, for piety hath juggled me, and taught me to revere, where I\nshould spurn. From all idols, I tear all veils; henceforth I will see\nthe hidden things; and live right out in my own hidden life!--Now I feel\nthat nothing but Truth can move me so. This letter is not a forgery. Oh!\nIsabel, thou art my sister; and I will love thee, and protect thee, ay,\nand own thee through all. Ah! forgive me, ye heavens, for my ignorant\nravings, and accept this my vow.--Here I swear myself Isabel's. Oh! thou\npoor castaway girl, that in loneliness and anguish must have long\nbreathed that same air, which I have only inhaled for delight; thou who\nmust even now be weeping, and weeping, cast into an ocean of uncertainty\nas to thy fate, which heaven hath placed in my hands; sweet Isabel!\nwould I not be baser than brass, and harder, and colder than ice, if I\ncould be insensible to such claims as thine? Thou movest before me, in\nrainbows spun of thy tears! I see thee long weeping, and God demands me\nfor thy comforter; and comfort thee, stand by thee, and fight for thee,\nwill thy leapingly-acknowledging brother, whom thy own father named\nPierre!\"\n\nHe could not stay in his chamber: the house contracted to a nut-shell\naround him; the walls smote his forehead; bare-headed he rushed from the\nplace, and only in the infinite air, found scope for that boundless\nexpansion of his life.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK IV.\n\nRETROSPECTIVE.\n\n\nI.\n\n\nIn their precise tracings-out and subtile causations, the strongest and\nfieriest emotions of life defy all analytical insight. We see the cloud,\nand feel its bolt; but meteorology only idly essays a critical scrutiny\nas to how that cloud became charged, and how this bolt so stuns. The\nmetaphysical writers confess, that the most impressive, sudden, and\noverwhelming event, as well as the minutest, is but the product of an\ninfinite series of infinitely involved and untraceable foregoing\noccurrences. Just so with every motion of the heart. Why this cheek\nkindles with a noble enthusiasm; why that lip curls in scorn; these are\nthings not wholly imputable to the immediate apparent cause, which is\nonly one link in the chain; but to a long line of dependencies whose\nfurther part is lost in the mid-regions of the impalpable air.\n\nIdle then would it be to attempt by any winding way so to penetrate into\nthe heart, and memory, and inmost life, and nature of Pierre, as to show\nwhy it was that a piece of intelligence which, in the natural course of\nthings, many amiable gentlemen, both young and old, have been known to\nreceive with a momentary feeling of surprise, and then a little\ncuriosity to know more, and at last an entire unconcern; idle would it\nbe, to attempt to show how to Pierre it rolled down on his soul like\nmelted lava, and left so deep a deposit of desolation, that all his\nsubsequent endeavors never restored the original temples to the soil,\nnor all his culture completely revived its buried bloom.\n\nBut some random hints may suffice to deprive a little of its\nstrangeness, that tumultuous mood, into which so small a note had thrown\nhim.\n\nThere had long stood a shrine in the fresh-foliaged heart of Pierre, up\nto which he ascended by many tableted steps of remembrance; and around\nwhich annually he had hung fresh wreaths of a sweet and holy affection.\nMade one green bower of at last, by such successive votive offerings of\nhis being; this shrine seemed, and was indeed, a place for the\ncelebration of a chastened joy, rather than for any melancholy rites.\nBut though thus mantled, and tangled with garlands, this shrine was of\nmarble--a niched pillar, deemed solid and eternal, and from whose top\nradiated all those innumerable sculptured scrolls and branches, which\nsupported the entire one-pillared temple of his moral life; as in some\nbeautiful gothic oratories, one central pillar, trunk-like, upholds the\nroof. In this shrine, in this niche of this pillar, stood the perfect\nmarble form of his departed father; without blemish, unclouded,\nsnow-white, and serene; Pierre's fond personification of perfect human\ngoodness and virtue. Before this shrine, Pierre poured out the fullness\nof all young life's most reverential thoughts and beliefs. Not to God\nhad Pierre ever gone in his heart, unless by ascending the steps of that\nshrine, and so making it the vestibule of his abstractest religion.\n\nBlessed and glorified in his tomb beyond Prince Mausolus is that mortal\nsire, who, after an honorable, pure course of life, dies, and is buried,\nas in a choice fountain, in the filial breast of a tender-hearted and\nintellectually appreciative child. For at that period, the Solomonic\ninsights have not poured their turbid tributaries into the pure-flowing\nwell of the childish life. Rare preservative virtue, too, have those\nheavenly waters. Thrown into that fountain, all sweet recollections\nbecome marbleized; so that things which in themselves were evanescent,\nthus became unchangeable and eternal. So, some rare waters in Derbyshire\nwill petrify birds'-nests. But if fate preserves the father to a later\ntime, too often the filial obsequies are less profound; the canonization\nless ethereal. The eye-expanded boy perceives, or vaguely thinks he\nperceives, slight specks and flaws in the character he once so wholly\nreverenced.\n\nWhen Pierre was twelve years old, his father had died, leaving behind\nhim, in the general voice of the world, a marked reputation as a\ngentleman and a Christian; in the heart of his wife, a green memory of\nmany healthy days of unclouded and joyful wedded life, and in the inmost\nsoul of Pierre, the impression of a bodily form of rare manly beauty and\nbenignity, only rivaled by the supposed perfect mould in which his\nvirtuous heart had been cast. Of pensive evenings, by the wide winter\nfire, or in summer, in the southern piazza, when that mystical\nnight-silence so peculiar to the country would summon up in the minds of\nPierre and his mother, long trains of the images of the past; leading\nall that spiritual procession, majestically and holily walked the\nvenerated form of the departed husband and father. Then their talk would\nbe reminiscent and serious, but sweet; and again, and again, still deep\nand deeper, was stamped in Pierre's soul the cherished conceit, that his\nvirtuous father, so beautiful on earth, was now uncorruptibly sainted in\nheaven. So choicely, and in some degree, secludedly nurtured, Pierre,\nthough now arrived at the age of nineteen, had never yet become so\nthoroughly initiated into that darker, though truer aspect of things,\nwhich an entire residence in the city from the earliest period of life,\nalmost inevitably engraves upon the mind of any keenly observant and\nreflective youth of Pierre's present years. So that up to this period,\nin his breast, all remained as it had been; and to Pierre, his father's\nshrine seemed spotless, and still new as the marble of the tomb of him\nof Arimathea.\n\nJudge, then, how all-desolating and withering the blast, that for\nPierre, in one night, stripped his holiest shrine of all over-laid\nbloom, and buried the mild statue of the saint beneath the prostrated\nruins of the soul's temple itself.\n\n\nII.\n\nAs the vine flourishes, and the grape empurples close up to the very\nwalls and muzzles of cannoned Ehrenbreitstein; so do the sweetest joys\nof life grow in the very jaws of its perils.\n\nBut is life, indeed, a thing for all infidel levities, and we, its\nmisdeemed beneficiaries, so utterly fools and infatuate, that what we\ntake to be our strongest tower of delight, only stands at the caprice of\nthe minutest event--the falling of a leaf, the hearing of a voice, or\nthe receipt of one little bit of paper scratched over with a few small\ncharacters by a sharpened feather? Are we so entirely insecure, that\nthat casket, wherein we have placed our holiest and most final joy, and\nwhich we have secured by a lock of infinite deftness; can that casket be\npicked and desecrated at the merest stranger's touch, when we think that\nwe alone hold the only and chosen key?\n\nPierre! thou art foolish; rebuild--no, not that, for thy shrine still\nstands; it stands, Pierre, firmly stands; smellest thou not its yet\nundeparted, embowering bloom? Such a note as thine can be easily enough\nwritten, Pierre; impostors are not unknown in this curious world; or the\nbrisk novelist, Pierre, will write thee fifty such notes, and so steal\ngushing tears from his reader's eyes; even as _thy_ note so strangely\nmade thine own manly eyes so arid; so glazed, and so arid,\nPierre--foolish Pierre!\n\nOh! mock not the poniarded heart. The stabbed man knows the steel; prate\nnot to him that it is only a tickling feather. Feels he not the interior\ngash? What does this blood on my vesture? and what does this pang in my\nsoul?\n\nAnd here again, not unreasonably, might invocations go up to those Three\nWeird Ones, that tend Life's loom. Again we might ask them, What threads\nwere those, oh, ye Weird Ones, that ye wove in the years foregone; that\nnow to Pierre, they so unerringly conduct electric presentiments, that\nhis woe is woe, his father no more a saint, and Isabel a sister indeed?\n\nAh, fathers and mothers! all the world round, be heedful,--give heed!\nThy little one may not now comprehend the meaning of those words and\nthose signs, by which, in its innocent presence, thou thinkest to\ndisguise the sinister thing ye would hint. Not now he knows; not very\nmuch even of the externals he consciously remarks; but if, in\nafter-life, Fate puts the chemic key of the cipher into his hands; then\nhow swiftly and how wonderfully, he reads all the obscurest and most\nobliterate inscriptions he finds in his memory; yea, and rummages\nhimself all over, for still hidden writings to read. Oh, darkest lessons\nof Life have thus been read; all faith in Virtue been murdered, and\nyouth gives itself up to an infidel scorn.\n\nBut not thus, altogether, was it now with Pierre; yet so like, in some\npoints, that the above true warning may not misplacedly stand.\n\nHis father had died of a fever; and, as is not uncommon in such\nmaladies, toward his end, he at intervals lowly wandered in his mind. At\nsuch times, by unobserved, but subtle arts, the devoted family\nattendants, had restrained his wife from being present at his side. But\nlittle Pierre, whose fond, filial love drew him ever to that bed; they\nheeded not innocent little Pierre, when his father was delirious; and\nso, one evening, when the shadows intermingled with the curtains; and\nall the chamber was hushed; and Pierre but dimly saw his father's face;\nand the fire on the hearth lay in a broken temple of wonderful coals;\nthen a strange, plaintive, infinitely pitiable, low voice, stole forth\nfrom the testered bed; and Pierre heard,--\"My daughter! my daughter!\"\n\n\"He wanders again,\" said the nurse.\n\n\"Dear, dear father!\" sobbed the child--\"thou hast not a daughter, but\nhere is thy own little Pierre.\"\n\nBut again the unregardful voice in the bed was heard; and now in a\nsudden, pealing wail,--\"My daughter!--God! God!--my daughter!\"\n\nThe child snatched the dying man's hand; it faintly grew to his grasp;\nbut on the other side of the bed, the other hand now also emptily lifted\nitself and emptily caught, as if at some other childish fingers. Then\nboth hands dropped on the sheet; and in the twinkling shadows of the\nevening little Pierre seemed to see, that while the hand which he held\nwore a faint, feverish flush, the other empty one was ashy white as a\nleper's.\n\n\"It is past,\" whispered the nurse, \"he will wander so no more now till\nmidnight,--that is his wont.\" And then, in her heart, she wondered how\nit was, that so excellent a gentleman, and so thoroughly good a man,\nshould wander so ambiguously in his mind; and trembled to think of that\nmysterious thing in the soul, which seems to acknowledge no human\njurisdiction, but in spite of the individual's own innocent self, will\nstill dream horrid dreams, and mutter unmentionable thoughts; and into\nPierre's awe-stricken, childish soul, there entered a kindred, though\nstill more nebulous conceit. But it belonged to the spheres of the\nimpalpable ether; and the child soon threw other and sweeter\nremembrances over it, and covered it up; and at last, it was blended\nwith all other dim things, and imaginings of dimness; and so, seemed to\nsurvive to no real life in Pierre. But though through many long years\nthe henbane showed no leaves in his soul; yet the sunken seed was\nthere: and the first glimpse of Isabel's letter caused it to spring\nforth, as by magic. Then, again, the long-hushed, plaintive and\ninfinitely pitiable voice was heard,--\"My daughter! my daughter!\"\nfollowed by the compunctious \"God! God!\" And to Pierre, once again the\nempty hand lifted itself, and once again the ashy hand fell.\n\n\nIII.\n\nIn the cold courts of justice the dull head demands oaths, and holy writ\nproofs; but in the warm halls of the heart one single, untestified\nmemory's spark shall suffice to enkindle such a blaze of evidence, that\nall the corners of conviction are as suddenly lighted up as a midnight\ncity by a burning building, which on every side whirls its reddened\nbrands.\n\nIn a locked, round-windowed closet connecting with the chamber of\nPierre, and whither he had always been wont to go, in those sweetly\nawful hours, when the spirit crieth to the spirit, Come into solitude\nwith me, twin-brother; come away: a secret have I; let me whisper it to\nthee aside; in this closet, sacred to the Tadmore privacies and repose\nof the sometimes solitary Pierre, there hung, by long cords from the\ncornice, a small portrait in oil, before which Pierre had many a time\ntrancedly stood. Had this painting hung in any annual public exhibition,\nand in its turn been described in print by the casual glancing critics,\nthey would probably have described it thus, and truthfully: \"An\nimpromptu portrait of a fine-looking, gay-hearted, youthful gentleman.\nHe is lightly, and, as it were, airily and but grazingly seated in, or\nrather flittingly tenanting an old-fashioned chair of Malacca. One arm\nconfining his hat and cane is loungingly thrown over the back of the\nchair, while the fingers of the other hand play with his gold\nwatch-seal and key. The free-templed head is sideways turned, with a\npeculiarly bright, and care-free, morning expression. He seems as if\njust dropped in for a visit upon some familiar acquaintance. Altogether,\nthe painting is exceedingly clever and cheerful; with a fine, off-handed\nexpression about it. Undoubtedly a portrait, and no fancy-piece; and, to\nhazard a vague conjecture, by an amateur.\"\n\nSo bright, and so cheerful then; so trim, and so young; so singularly\nhealthful, and handsome; what subtile element could so steep this whole\nportrait, that, to the wife of the original, it was namelessly\nunpleasant and repelling? The mother of Pierre could never abide this\npicture which she had always asserted did signally belie her husband.\nHer fond memories of the departed refused to hang one single wreath\naround it. It is not he, she would emphatically and almost indignantly\nexclaim, when more urgently besought to reveal the cause for so\nunreasonable a dissent from the opinion of nearly all the other\nconnections and relatives of the deceased. But the portrait which she\nheld to do justice to her husband, correctly to convey his features in\ndetail, and more especially their truest, and finest, and noblest\ncombined expression; this portrait was a much larger one, and in the\ngreat drawing-room below occupied the most conspicuous and honorable\nplace on the wall.\n\nEven to Pierre these two paintings had always seemed strangely\ndissimilar. And as the larger one had been painted many years after the\nother, and therefore brought the original pretty nearly within his own\nchildish recollections; therefore, he himself could not but deem it by\nfar the more truthful and life-like presentation of his father. So that\nthe mere preference of his mother, however strong, was not at all\nsurprising to him, but rather coincided with his own conceit. Yet not\nfor this, must the other portrait be so decidedly rejected. Because, in\nthe first place, there was a difference in time, and some difference of\ncostume to be considered, and the wide difference of the styles of the\nrespective artiste, and the wide difference of those respective,\nsemi-reflected, ideal faces, which, even in the presence of the\noriginal, a spiritual artist will rather choose to draw from than from\nthe fleshy face, however brilliant and fine. Moreover, while the larger\nportrait was that of a middle-aged, married man, and seemed to possess\nall the nameless and slightly portly tranquillities, incident to that\ncondition when a felicitous one; the smaller portrait painted a brisk,\nunentangled, young bachelor, gayly ranging up and down in the world;\nlight-hearted, and a very little bladish perhaps; and charged to the\nlips with the first uncloying morning fullness and freshness of life.\nHere, certainly, large allowance was to be made in any careful, candid\nestimation of these portraits. To Pierre this conclusion had become\nwell-nigh irresistible, when he placed side by side two portraits of\nhimself; one taken in his early childhood, a frocked and belted boy of\nfour years old; and the other, a grown youth of sixteen. Except an\nindestructible, all-surviving something in the eyes and on the temples,\nPierre could hardly recognize the loud-laughing boy in the tall, and\npensively smiling youth. If a few years, then, can have in me made all\nthis difference, why not in my father? thought Pierre.\n\nBesides all this, Pierre considered the history, and, so to speak, the\nfamily legend of the smaller painting. In his fifteenth year, it was\nmade a present to him by an old maiden aunt, who resided in the city,\nand who cherished the memory of Pierre's father, with all that wonderful\namaranthine devotion which an advanced maiden sister ever feels for the\nidea of a beloved younger brother, now dead and irrevocably gone. As the\nonly child of that brother, Pierre was an object of the warmest and most\nextravagant attachment on the part of this lonely aunt, who seemed to\nsee, transformed into youth once again, the likeness, and very soul of\nher brother, in the fair, inheriting brow of Pierre. Though the portrait\nwe speak of was inordinately prized by her, yet at length the strict\ncanon of her romantic and imaginative love asserted the portrait to be\nPierre's--for Pierre was not only his father's only child, but his\nnamesake--so soon as Pierre should be old enough to value aright so holy\nand inestimable a treasure. She had accordingly sent it to him, trebly\nboxed, and finally covered with a water-proof cloth; and it was\ndelivered at Saddle Meadows, by an express, confidential messenger, an\nold gentleman of leisure, once her forlorn, because rejected gallant,\nbut now her contented, and chatty neighbor. Henceforth, before a\ngold-framed and gold-lidded ivory miniature,--a fraternal gift--aunt\nDorothea now offered up her morning and her evening rites, to the memory\nof the noblest and handsomest of brothers. Yet an annual visit to the\nfar closet of Pierre--no slight undertaking now for one so stricken in\nyears, and every way infirm--attested the earnestness of that strong\nsense of duty, that painful renunciation of self, which had induced her\nvoluntarily to part with the precious memorial.\n\n\nIV.\n\n\"Tell me, aunt,\" the child Pierre had early said to her, long before the\nportrait became his--\"tell me, aunt, how this chair-portrait, as you\ncall it, was painted;--who painted it?--whose chair was this?--have you\nthe chair now?--I don't see it in your room here;--what is papa looking\nat so strangely?--I should like to know now, what papa was thinking of,\nthen. Do, now, dear aunt, tell me all about this picture, so that when\nit is mine, as you promise me, I shall know its whole history.\"\n\n\"Sit down, then, and be very still and attentive, my dear child,\" said\naunt Dorothea; while she a little averted her head, and tremulously and\ninaccurately sought her pocket, till little Pierre cried--\"Why, aunt,\nthe story of the picture is not in any little book, is it, that you are\ngoing to take out and read to me?\"\n\n\"My handkerchief, my child.\"\n\n\"Why, aunt, here it is, at your elbow; here, on the table; here, aunt;\ntake it, do; Oh, don't tell me any thing about the picture, now; I won't\nhear it.\"\n\n\"Be still, my darling Pierre,\" said his aunt, taking the handkerchief,\n\"draw the curtain a little, dearest; the light hurts my eyes. Now, go\ninto the closet, and bring me my dark shawl;--take your time.--There;\nthank you, Pierre; now sit down again, and I will begin.--The picture\nwas painted long ago, my child; you were not born then.\"\n\n\"Not born?\" cried little Pierre.\n\n\"Not born,\" said his aunt.\n\n\"Well, go on, aunt; but don't tell me again that once upon a time I was\nnot little Pierre at all, and yet my father was alive. Go on, aunt,--do,\ndo!\"\n\n\"Why, how nervous you are getting, my child;--Be patient; I am very old,\nPierre; and old people never like to be hurried.\"\n\n\"Now, my own dear Aunt Dorothea, do forgive me this once, and go on with\nyour story.\"\n\n\"When your poor father was quite a young man, my child, and was on one\nof his long autumnal visits to his friends in this city, he was rather\nintimate at times with a cousin of his, Ralph Winwood, who was about his\nown age,--a fine youth he was, too, Pierre.\"\n\n\"I never saw him, aunt; pray, where is he now?\" interrupted\nPierre;--\"does he live in the country, now, as mother and I do?\"\n\n\"Yes, my child; but a far-away, beautiful country, I hope;--he's in\nheaven, I trust.\"\n\n\"Dead,\" sighed little Pierre--\"go on, aunt.\"\n\n\"Now, cousin Ralph had a great love for painting, my child; and he\nspent many hours in a room, hung all round with pictures and portraits;\nand there he had his easel and brushes; and much liked to paint his\nfriends, and hang their faces on his walls; so that when all alone by\nhimself, he yet had plenty of company, who always wore their best\nexpressions to him, and never once ruffled him, by ever getting cross or\nill-natured, little Pierre. Often, he had besought your father to sit to\nhim; saying, that his silent circle of friends would never be complete,\ntill your father consented to join them. But in those days, my child,\nyour father was always in motion. It was hard for me to get him to stand\nstill, while I tied his cravat; for he never came to any one but me for\nthat. So he was always putting off, and putting off cousin Ralph. 'Some\nother time, cousin; not to-day;--to-morrow, perhaps;--or next\nweek;'--and so, at last cousin Ralph began to despair. But I'll catch\nhim yet, cried sly cousin Ralph. So now he said nothing more to your\nfather about the matter of painting him; but every pleasant morning kept\nhis easel and brushes and every thing in readiness; so as to be ready\nthe first moment your father should chance to drop in upon him from his\nlong strolls; for it was now and then your father's wont to pay flying\nlittle visits to cousin Ralph in his painting-room.--But, my child, you\nmay draw back the curtain now--it's getting very dim here, seems to me.\"\n\n\"Well, I thought so all along, aunt,\" said little Pierre, obeying; \"but\ndidn't you say the light hurt your eyes.\"\n\n\"But it does not now, little Pierre.\"\n\n\"Well, well; go on, go on, aunt; you can't think how interested I am,\"\nsaid little Pierre, drawing his stool close up to the quilted satin hem\nof his good Aunt Dorothea's dress.\n\n\"I will, my child. But first let me tell you, that about this time there\narrived in the port, a cabin-full of French emigrants of quality;--poor\npeople, Pierre, who were forced to fly from their native land, because\nof the cruel, blood-shedding times there. But you have read all that in\nthe little history I gave you, a good while ago.\"\n\n\"I know all about it;--the French Revolution,\" said little Pierre.\n\n\"What a famous little scholar you are, my dear child,\"--said Aunt\nDorothea, faintly smiling--\"among those poor, but noble emigrants, there\nwas a beautiful young girl, whose sad fate afterward made a great noise\nin the city, and made many eyes to weep, but in vain, for she never was\nheard of any more.\"\n\n\"How? how? aunt;--I don't understand;--did she disappear then, aunt?\"\n\n\"I was a little before my story, child. Yes, she did disappear, and\nnever was heard of again; but that was afterward, some time afterward,\nmy child. I am very sure it was; I could take my oath of that, Pierre.\"\n\n\"Why, dear aunt,\" said little Pierre, \"how earnestly you talk--after\nwhat? your voice is getting very strange; do now;--don't talk that way;\nyou frighten me so, aunt.\"\n\n\"Perhaps it is this bad cold I have to-day; it makes my voice a little\nhoarse, I fear, Pierre. But I will try and not talk so hoarsely again.\nWell, my child, some time before this beautiful young lady disappeared,\nindeed it was only shortly after the poor emigrants landed, your father\nmade her acquaintance; and with many other humane gentlemen of the city,\nprovided for the wants of the strangers, for they were very poor indeed,\nhaving been stripped of every thing, save a little trifling jewelry,\nwhich could not go very far. At last, the friends of your father\nendeavored to dissuade him from visiting these people so much; they were\nfearful that as the young lady was so very beautiful, and a little\ninclined to be intriguing--so some said--your father might be tempted to\nmarry her; which would not have been a wise thing in him; for though the\nyoung lady might have been very beautiful, and good-hearted, yet no one\non this side the water certainly knew her history; and she was a\nforeigner; and would not have made so suitable and excellent a match for\nyour father as your dear mother afterward did, my child. But, for\nmyself, I--who always knew your father very well in all his intentions,\nand he was very confidential with me, too--I, for my part, never\ncredited that he would do so unwise a thing as marry the strange young\nlady. At any rate, he at last discontinued his visits to the emigrants;\nand it was after this that the young lady disappeared. Some said that\nshe must have voluntarily but secretly returned into her own country;\nand others declared that she must have been kidnapped by French\nemissaries; for, after her disappearance, rumor began to hint that she\nwas of the noblest birth, and some ways allied to the royal family; and\nthen, again, there were some who shook their heads darkly, and muttered\nof drownings, and other dark things; which one always hears hinted when\npeople disappear, and no one can find them. But though your father and\nmany other gentlemen moved heaven and earth to find trace of her, yet,\nas I said before, my child, she never re-appeared.\"\n\n\"The poor French lady!\" sighed little Pierre. \"Aunt, I'm afraid she was\nmurdered.\"\n\n\"Poor lady, there is no telling,\" said his aunt. \"But listen, for I am\ncoming to the picture again. Now, at the time your father was so often\nvisiting the emigrants, my child, cousin Ralph was one of those who a\nlittle fancied that your father was courting her; but cousin Ralph being\na quiet young man, and a scholar, not well acquainted with what is wise,\nor what is foolish in the great world; cousin Ralph would not have been\nat all mortified had your father really wedded with the refugee young\nlady. So vainly thinking, as I told you, that your father was courting\nher, he fancied it would be a very fine thing if he could paint your\nfather as her wooer; that is, paint him just after his coming from his\ndaily visits to the emigrants. So he watched his chance; every thing\nbeing ready in his painting-room, as I told you before; and one\nmorning, sure enough, in dropt your father from his walk. But before he\ncame into the room, cousin Ralph had spied him from the window; and when\nyour father entered, cousin Ralph had the sitting-chair ready drawn out,\nback of his easel, but still fronting toward him, and pretended to be\nvery busy painting. He said to your father--'Glad to see you, cousin\nPierre; I am just about something here; sit right down there now, and\ntell me the news; and I'll sally out with you presently. And tell us\nsomething of the emigrants, cousin Pierre,' he slyly added--wishing, you\nsee, to get your father's thoughts running that supposed wooing way, so\nthat he might catch some sort of corresponding expression you see,\nlittle Pierre.\"\n\n\"I don't know that I precisely understand, aunt; but go on, I am so\ninterested; do go on, dear aunt.\"\n\n\"Well, by many little cunning shifts and contrivances, cousin Ralph kept\nyour father there sitting, and sitting in the chair, rattling and\nrattling away, and so self-forgetful too, that he never heeded that all\nthe while sly cousin Ralph was painting and painting just as fast as\never he could; and only making believe laugh at your father's wit; in\nshort, cousin Ralph was stealing his portrait, my child.\"\n\n\"Not _stealing_ it, I hope,\" said Pierre, \"that would be very wicked.\"\n\n\"Well, then, we won't call it stealing, since I am sure that cousin\nRalph kept your father all the time off from him, and so, could not have\npossibly picked his pocket, though indeed, he slyly picked his portrait,\nso to speak. And if indeed it was stealing, or any thing of that sort;\nyet seeing how much comfort that portrait has been to me, Pierre, and\nhow much it will yet be to you, I hope; I think we must very heartily\nforgive cousin Ralph, for what he then did.\"\n\n\"Yes, I think we must indeed,\" chimed in little Pierre, now eagerly\neying the very portrait in question, which hung over the mantle.\n\n\"Well, by catching your father two or three times more in that way,\ncousin Ralph at last finished the painting; and when it was all framed,\nand every way completed, he would have surprised your father by hanging\nit boldly up in his room among his other portraits, had not your father\none morning suddenly come to him--while, indeed, the very picture itself\nwas placed face down on a table and cousin Ralph fixing the cord to\nit--came to him, and frightened cousin Ralph by quietly saying, that now\nthat he thought of it, it seemed to him that cousin Ralph had been\nplaying tricks with him; but he hoped it was not so. 'What do you mean?'\nsaid cousin Ralph, a little flurried. 'You have not been hanging my\nportrait up here, have you, cousin Ralph?' said your father, glancing\nalong the walls. 'I'm glad I don't see it. It is my whim, cousin\nRalph,--and perhaps it is a very silly one,--but if you have been lately\npainting my portrait, I want you to destroy it; at any rate, don't show\nit to any one, keep it out of sight. What's that you have there, cousin\nRalph?'\n\n\"Cousin Ralph was now more and more fluttered; not knowing what to\nmake--as indeed, to this day, I don't completely myself--of your\nfather's strange manner. But he rallied, and said--'This, cousin Pierre,\nis a secret portrait I have here; you must be aware that we\nportrait-painters are sometimes called upon to paint such. I, therefore,\ncan not show it to you, or tell you any thing about it.'\n\n\"'Have you been painting my portrait or not, cousin Ralph?' said your\nfather, very suddenly and pointedly.\n\n\"'I have painted nothing that looks as you there look,' said cousin\nRalph, evasively, observing in your father's face a fierce-like\nexpression, which he had never seen there before. And more than that,\nyour father could not get from him.\"\n\n\"And what then?\" said little Pierre.\n\n\"Why not much, my child; only your father never so much as caught one\nglimpse of that picture; indeed, never knew for certain, whether there\nwas such a painting in the world. Cousin Ralph secretly gave it to me,\nknowing how tenderly I loved your father; making me solemnly promise\nnever to expose it anywhere where your father could ever see it, or any\nway hear of it. This promise I faithfully kept; and it was only after\nyour dear father's death, that I hung it in my chamber. There, Pierre,\nyou now have the story of the chair-portrait.\"\n\n\"And a very strange one it is,\" said Pierre--\"and so interesting, I\nshall never forget it, aunt.\"\n\n\"I hope you never will, my child. Now ring the bell, and we will have a\nlittle fruit-cake, and I will take a glass of wine, Pierre;--do you\nhear, my child?--the bell--ring it. Why, what do you do standing there,\nPierre?\"\n\n\"_Why_ didn't papa want to have cousin Ralph paint his picture, aunt?\"\n\n\"How these children's minds do run!\" exclaimed old aunt Dorothea staring\nat little Pierre in amazement--\"That indeed is more than I can tell you,\nlittle Pierre. But cousin Ralph had a foolish fancy about it. He used to\ntell me, that being in your father's room some few days after the last\nscene I described, he noticed there a very wonderful work on\nPhysiognomy, as they call it, in which the strangest and shadowiest\nrules were laid down for detecting people's innermost secrets by\nstudying their faces. And so, foolish cousin Ralph always flattered\nhimself, that the reason your father did not want his portrait taken\nwas, because he was secretly in love with the French young lady, and did\nnot want his secret published in a portrait; since the wonderful work on\nPhysiognomy had, as it were, indirectly warned him against running that\nrisk. But cousin Ralph being such a retired and solitary sort of a\nyouth, he always had such curious whimsies about things. For my part, I\ndon't believe your father ever had any such ridiculous ideas on the\nsubject. To be sure, I myself can not tell you _why_ he did not want his\npicture taken; but when you get to be as old as I am, little Pierre, you\nwill find that every one, even the best of us, at times, is apt to act\nvery queerly and unaccountably; indeed some things we do, we can not\nentirely explain the reason of, even to ourselves, little Pierre. But\nyou will know all about these strange matters by and by.\"\n\n\"I hope I shall, aunt,\" said little Pierre--\"But, dear aunt, I thought\nMarten was to bring in some fruit-cake?\"\n\n\"Ring the bell for him, then, my child.\"\n\n\"Oh! I forgot,\" said little Pierre, doing her bidding.\n\nBy-and-by, while the aunt was sipping her wine; and the boy eating his\ncake, and both their eyes were fixed on the portrait in question; little\nPierre, pushing his stool nearer the picture exclaimed--\"Now, aunt, did\npapa really look exactly like that? Did you ever see him in that same\nbuff vest, and huge-figured neckcloth? I remember the seal and key,\npretty well; and it was only a week ago that I saw mamma take them out\nof a little locked drawer in her wardrobe--but I don't remember the\nqueer whiskers; nor the buff vest; nor the huge white-figured neckcloth;\ndid you ever see papa in that very neckcloth, aunt?\"\n\n\"My child, it was I that chose the stuff for that neckcloth; yes, and\nhemmed it for him, and worked P. G. in one corner; but that aint in the\npicture. It is an excellent likeness, my child, neckcloth and all; as he\nlooked at that time. Why, little Pierre, sometimes I sit here all alone\nby myself, gazing, and gazing, and gazing at that face, till I begin to\nthink your father is looking at me, and smiling at me, and nodding at\nme, and saying--Dorothea! Dorothea!\"\n\n\"How strange,\" said little Pierre, \"I think it begins to look at me now,\naunt. Hark! aunt, it's so silent all round in this old-fashioned room,\nthat I think I hear a little jingling in the picture, as if the\nwatch-seal was striking against the key--Hark! aunt.\"\n\n\"Bless me, don't talk so strangely, my child.\"\n\n\"I heard mamma say once--but she did not say so to me--that, for her\npart, she did not like aunt Dorothea's picture; it was not a good\nlikeness, so she said. Why don't mamma like the picture, aunt?\"\n\n\"My child, you ask very queer questions. If your mamma don't like the\npicture, it is for a very plain reason. She has a much larger and finer\none at home, which she had painted for herself; yes, and paid I don't\nknow how many hundred dollars for it; and that, too, is an excellent\nlikeness, _that_ must be the reason, little Pierre.\"\n\nAnd thus the old aunt and the little child ran on; each thinking the\nother very strange; and both thinking the picture still stranger; and\nthe face in the picture still looked at them frankly, and cheerfully, as\nif there was nothing kept concealed; and yet again, a little ambiguously\nand mockingly, as if slyly winking to some other picture, to mark what a\nvery foolish old sister, and what a very silly little son, were growing\nso monstrously grave and speculative about a huge white-figured\nneckcloth, a buff vest, and a very gentleman-like and amiable\ncountenance.\n\nAnd so, after this scene, as usual, one by one, the fleet years ran on;\ntill the little child Pierre had grown up to be the tall Master Pierre,\nand could call the picture his own; and now, in the privacy of his own\nlittle closet, could stand, or lean, or sit before it all day long, if\nhe pleased, and keep thinking, and thinking, and thinking, and thinking,\ntill by-and-by all thoughts were blurred, and at last there were no\nthoughts at all.\n\nBefore the picture was sent to him, in his fifteenth year, it had been\nonly through the inadvertence of his mother, or rather through a casual\npassing into a parlor by Pierre, that he had any way learned that his\nmother did not approve of the picture. Because, as then Pierre was\nstill young, and the picture was the picture of his father, and the\ncherished property of a most excellent, and dearly-beloved, affectionate\naunt; therefore the mother, with an intuitive delicacy, had refrained\nfrom knowingly expressing her peculiar opinion in the presence of little\nPierre. And this judicious, though half-unconscious delicacy in the\nmother, had been perhaps somewhat singularly answered by a like nicety\nof sentiment in the child; for children of a naturally refined\norganization, and a gentle nurture, sometimes possess a wonderful, and\noften undreamed of, daintiness of propriety, and thoughtfulness, and\nforbearance, in matters esteemed a little subtile even by their elders,\nand self-elected betters. The little Pierre never disclosed to his\nmother that he had, through another person, become aware of her thoughts\nconcerning Aunt Dorothea's portrait; he seemed to possess an intuitive\nknowledge of the circumstance, that from the difference of their\nrelationship to his father, and for other minute reasons, he could in\nsome things, with the greater propriety, be more inquisitive concerning\nhim, with his aunt, than with his mother, especially touching the matter\nof the chair-portrait. And Aunt Dorothea's reasons accounting for his\nmother's distaste, long continued satisfactory, or at least not\nunsufficiently explanatory.\n\nAnd when the portrait arrived at the Meadows, it so chanced that his\nmother was abroad; and so Pierre silently hung it up in his closet; and\nwhen after a day or two his mother returned, he said nothing to her\nabout its arrival, being still strangely alive to that certain mild\nmystery which invested it, and whose sacredness now he was fearful of\nviolating, by provoking any discussion with his mother about Aunt\nDorothea's gift, or by permitting himself to be improperly curious\nconcerning the reasons of his mother's private and self-reserved\nopinions of it. But the first time--and it was not long after the\narrival of the portrait--that he knew of his mother's having entered\nhis closet; then, when he next saw her, he was prepared to hear what\nshe should voluntarily say about the late addition to its\nembellishments; but as she omitted all mention of any thing of that\nsort, he unobtrusively scanned her countenance, to mark whether any\nlittle clouding emotion might be discoverable there. But he could\ndiscern none. And as all genuine delicacies are by their nature\naccumulative; therefore this reverential, mutual, but only tacit\nforbearance of the mother and son, ever after continued uninvaded. And\nit was another sweet, and sanctified, and sanctifying bond between them.\nFor, whatever some lovers may sometimes say, love does not always abhor\na secret, as nature is said to abhor a vacuum. Love is built upon\nsecrets, as lovely Venice upon invisible and incorruptible piles in the\nsea. Love's secrets, being mysteries, ever pertain to the transcendent\nand the infinite; and so they are as airy bridges, by which our further\nshadows pass over into the regions of the golden mists and exhalations;\nwhence all poetical, lovely thoughts are engendered, and drop into us,\nas though pearls should drop from rainbows.\n\nAs time went on, the chasteness and pure virginity of this mutual\nreservation, only served to dress the portrait in sweeter, because still\nmore mysterious attractions; and to fling, as it were, fresh fennel and\nrosemary around the revered memory of the father. Though, indeed, as\npreviously recounted, Pierre now and then loved to present to himself\nfor some fanciful solution the penultimate secret of the portrait, in so\nfar, as that involved his mother's distaste; yet the cunning analysis in\nwhich such a mental procedure would involve him, never voluntarily\ntransgressed that sacred limit, where his mother's peculiar repugnance\nbegan to shade off into ambiguous considerations, touching any unknown\npossibilities in the character and early life of the original. Not, that\nhe had altogether forbidden his fancy to range in such fields of\nspeculation; but all such imaginings must be contributory to that pure,\nexalted idea of his father, which, in his soul, was based upon the known\nacknowledged facts of his father's life.\n\n\nV.\n\nIf, when the mind roams up and down in the ever-elastic regions of\nevanescent invention, any definite form or feature can be assigned to\nthe multitudinous shapes it creates out of the incessant dissolvings of\nits own prior creations; then might we here attempt to hold and define\nthe least shadowy of those reasons, which about the period of\nadolescence we now treat of, more frequently occurred to Pierre,\nwhenever he essayed to account for his mother's remarkable distaste for\nthe portrait. Yet will we venture one sketch.\n\nYes--sometimes dimly thought Pierre--who knows but cousin Ralph, after\nall, may have been not so very far from the truth, when he surmised that\nat one time my father did indeed cherish some passing emotion for the\nbeautiful young Frenchwoman. And this portrait being painted at that\nprecise time, and indeed with the precise purpose of perpetuating some\nshadowy testification of the fact in the countenance of the original:\ntherefore, its expression is not congenial, is not familiar, is not\naltogether agreeable to my mother: because, not only did my father's\nfeatures never look so to her (since it was afterward that she first\nbecame acquainted with him), but also, that certain womanliness of\nwomen; that thing I should perhaps call a tender jealousy, a fastidious\nvanity, in any other lady, enables her to perceive that the glance of\nthe face in the portrait, is not, in some nameless way, dedicated to\nherself, but to some other and unknown object; and therefore, is she\nimpatient of it, and it is repelling to her; for she must naturally be\nintolerant of any imputed reminiscence in my father, which is not in\nsome way connected with her own recollections of him.\n\nWhereas, the larger and more expansive portrait in the great\ndrawing-room, taken in the prime of life; during the best and rosiest\ndays of their wedded union; at the particular desire of my mother; and\nby a celebrated artist of her own election, and costumed after her own\ntaste; and on all hands considered to be, by those who know, a\nsingularly happy likeness at the period; a belief spiritually reinforced\nby my own dim infantile remembrances; for all these reasons, this\ndrawing-room portrait possesses an inestimable charm to her; there, she\nindeed beholds her husband as he had really appeared to her; she does\nnot vacantly gaze upon an unfamiliar phantom called up from the distant,\nand, to her, well-nigh fabulous days of my father's bachelor life. But\nin that other portrait, she sees rehearsed to her fond eyes, the latter\ntales and legends of his devoted wedded love. Yes, I think now that I\nplainly see it must be so. And yet, ever new conceits come vaporing up\nin me, as I look on the strange chair-portrait: which, though so very\nmuch more unfamiliar to me, than it can possibly be to my mother, still\nsometimes seems to say--Pierre, believe not the drawing-room painting;\nthat is not thy father; or, at least, is not _all_ of thy father.\nConsider in thy mind, Pierre, whether we two paintings may not make only\none. Faithful wives are ever over-fond to a certain imaginary image of\ntheir husbands; and faithful widows are ever over-reverential to a\ncertain imagined ghost of that same imagined image, Pierre. Look again,\nI am thy father as he more truly was. In mature life, the world overlays\nand varnishes us, Pierre; the thousand proprieties and polished\nfinenesses and grimaces intervene, Pierre; then, we, as it were,\nabdicate ourselves, and take unto us another self, Pierre; in youth we\n_are_, Pierre, but in age we _seem_. Look again. I am thy real father,\nso much the more truly, as thou thinkest thou recognizest me not,\nPierre. To their young children, fathers are not wont to unfold\nthemselves entirely, Pierre. There are a thousand and one odd little\nyouthful peccadilloes, that we think we may as well not divulge to them,\nPierre. Consider this strange, ambiguous smile, Pierre; more narrowly\nregard this mouth. Behold, what is this too ardent and, as it were,\nunchastened light in these eyes, Pierre? I am thy father, boy. There was\nonce a certain, oh, but too lovely young Frenchwoman, Pierre. Youth is\nhot, and temptation strong, Pierre; and in the minutest moment momentous\nthings are irrevocably done, Pierre; and Time sweeps on, and the thing\nis not always carried down by its stream, but may be left stranded on\nits bank; away beyond, in the young, green countries, Pierre. Look\nagain. Doth thy mother dislike me for naught? Consider. Do not all her\nspontaneous, loving impressions, ever strive to magnify, and\nspiritualize, and deify, her husband's memory, Pierre? Then why doth she\ncast despite upon me; and never speak to thee of me; and why dost thou\nthyself keep silence before her, Pierre? Consider. Is there no little\nmystery here? Probe a little, Pierre. Never fear, never fear. No matter\nfor thy father now. Look, do I not smile?--yes, and with an unchangeable\nsmile; and thus have I unchangeably smiled for many long years gone by,\nPierre. Oh, it is a permanent smile! Thus I smiled to cousin Ralph; and\nthus in thy dear old Aunt Dorothea's parlor, Pierre; and just so, I\nsmile here to thee, and even thus in thy father's later life, when his\nbody may have been in grief, still--hidden away in Aunt Dorothea's\nsecretary--I thus smiled as before; and just so I'd smile were I now\nhung up in the deepest dungeon of the Spanish Inquisition, Pierre;\nthough suspended in outer darkness, still would I smile with this smile,\nthough then not a soul should be near. Consider; for a smile is the\nchosen vehicle for all ambiguities, Pierre. When we would deceive, we\nsmile; when we are hatching any nice little artifice, Pierre; only just\na little gratifying our own sweet little appetites, Pierre; then watch\nus, and out comes the odd little smile. Once upon a time, there was a\nlovely young Frenchwoman, Pierre. Have you carefully, and analytically,\nand psychologically, and metaphysically, considered her belongings and\nsurroundings, and all her incidentals, Pierre? Oh, a strange sort of\nstory, that, thy dear old Aunt Dorothea once told thee, Pierre. I once\nknew a credulous old soul, Pierre. Probe, probe a little--see--there\nseems one little crack there, Pierre--a wedge, a wedge. Something ever\ncomes of all persistent inquiry; we are not so continually curious for\nnothing, Pierre; not for nothing, do we so intrigue and become wily\ndiplomatists, and glozers with our own minds, Pierre; and afraid of\nfollowing the Indian trail from the open plain into the dark thickets,\nPierre; but enough; a word to the wise.\n\nThus sometimes in the mystical, outer quietude of the long country\nnights; either when the hushed mansion was banked round by the\nthick-fallen December snows, or banked round by the immovable white\nAugust moonlight; in the haunted repose of a wide story, tenanted only\nby himself; and sentineling his own little closet; and standing guard,\nas it were, before the mystical tent of the picture; and ever watching\nthe strangely concealed lights of the meanings that so mysteriously\nmoved to and fro within; thus sometimes stood Pierre before the portrait\nof his father, unconsciously throwing himself open to all those\nineffable hints and ambiguities, and undefined half-suggestions, which\nnow and then people the soul's atmosphere, as thickly as in a soft,\nsteady snow-storm, the snow-flakes people the air. Yet as often starting\nfrom these reveries and trances, Pierre would regain the assured element\nof consciously bidden and self-propelled thought; and then in a moment\nthe air all cleared, not a snow-flake descended, and Pierre, upbraiding\nhimself for his self-indulgent infatuation, would promise never again\nto fall into a midnight revery before the chair-portrait of his father.\nNor did the streams of these reveries seem to leave any conscious\nsediment in his mind; they were so light and so rapid, that they rolled\ntheir own alluvial along; and seemed to leave all Pierre's\nthought-channels as clean and dry as though never any alluvial stream\nhad rolled there at all.\n\nAnd so still in his sober, cherishing memories, his father's\nbeatification remained untouched; and all the strangeness of the\nportrait only served to invest his idea with a fine, legendary romance;\nthe essence whereof was that very mystery, which at other times was so\nsubtly and evilly significant.\n\nBut now, _now!_--Isabel's letter read: swift as the first light that\nslides from the sun, Pierre saw all preceding ambiguities, all mysteries\nripped open as if with a keen sword, and forth trooped thickening\nphantoms of an infinite gloom. Now his remotest infantile\nreminiscences--the wandering mind of his father--the empty hand, and the\nashen--the strange story of Aunt Dorothea--the mystical midnight\nsuggestions of the portrait itself; and, above all, his mother's\nintuitive aversion, all, all overwhelmed him with reciprocal\ntestimonies.\n\nAnd now, by irresistible intuitions, all that had been inexplicably\nmysterious to him in the portrait, and all that had been inexplicably\nfamiliar in the face, most magically these now coincided; the merriness\nof the one not inharmonious with the mournfulness of the other, but by\nsome ineffable correlativeness, they reciprocally identified each other,\nand, as it were, melted into each other, and thus interpenetratingly\nuniting, presented lineaments of an added supernaturalness.\n\nOn all sides, the physical world of solid objects now slidingly\ndisplaced itself from around him, and he floated into an ether of\nvisions; and, starting to his feet with clenched hands and outstaring\neyes at the transfixed face in the air, he ejaculated that wonderful\nverse from Dante, descriptive of the two mutually absorbing shapes in\nthe Inferno:\n\n        \"Ah! how dost thou change,\n    Agnello! See! thou art not double now,\n    Nor only one!\"\n\n\n\n\nBOOK V.\n\nMISGIVINGS AND PREPARATIONS.\n\n\nI.\n\nIt was long after midnight when Pierre returned to the house. He had\nrushed forth in that complete abandonment of soul, which, in so ardent a\ntemperament, attends the first stages of any sudden and tremendous\naffliction; but now he returned in pallid composure, for the calm spirit\nof the night, and the then risen moon, and the late revealed stars, had\nall at last become as a strange subduing melody to him, which, though at\nfirst trampled and scorned, yet by degrees had stolen into the windings\nof his heart, and so shed abroad its own quietude in him. Now, from his\nheight of composure, he firmly gazed abroad upon the charred landscape\nwithin him; as the timber man of Canada, forced to fly from the\nconflagration of his forests, comes back again when the fires have\nwaned, and unblinkingly eyes the immeasurable fields of fire-brands that\nhere and there glow beneath the wide canopy of smoke.\n\nIt has been said, that always when Pierre would seek solitude in its\nmaterial shelter and walled isolation, then the closet communicating\nwith his chamber was his elected haunt. So, going to his room, he took\nup the now dim-burning lamp he had left there, and instinctively entered\nthat retreat, seating himself, with folded arms and bowed head, in the\naccustomed dragon-footed old chair. With leaden feet, and heart now\nchanging from iciness to a strange sort of indifference, and a numbing\nsensation stealing over him, he sat there awhile, till, like the resting\ntraveler in snows, he began to struggle against this inertness as the\nmost treacherous and deadliest of symptoms. He looked up, and found\nhimself fronted by the no longer wholly enigmatical, but still\nambiguously smiling picture of his father. Instantly all his\nconsciousness and his anguish returned, but still without power to shake\nthe grim tranquillity which possessed him. Yet endure the smiling\nportrait he could not; and obeying an irresistible nameless impulse, he\nrose, and without unhanging it, reversed the picture on the wall.\n\nThis brought to sight the defaced and dusty back, with some wrinkled,\ntattered paper over the joints, which had become loosened from the\npaste. \"Oh, symbol of thy reversed idea in my soul,\" groaned Pierre;\n\"thou shalt not hang thus. Rather cast thee utterly out, than\nconspicuously insult thee so. I will no more have a father.\" He removed\nthe picture wholly from the wall, and the closet; and concealed it in a\nlarge chest, covered with blue chintz, and locked it up there. But\nstill, in a square space of slightly discolored wall, the picture still\nleft its shadowy, but vacant and desolate trace. He now strove to banish\nthe least trace of his altered father, as fearful that at present all\nthoughts concerning him were not only entirely vain, but would prove\nfatally distracting and incapacitating to a mind, which was now loudly\ncalled upon, not only to endure a signal grief, but immediately to act\nupon it. Wild and cruel case, youth ever thinks; but mistakenly; for\nExperience well knows, that action, though it seems an aggravation of\nwoe, is really an alleviative; though permanently to alleviate pain, we\nmust first dart some added pangs.\n\nNor now, though profoundly sensible that his whole previous moral being\nwas overturned, and that for him the fair structure of the world must,\nin some then unknown way, be entirely rebuilded again, from the\nlowermost corner stone up; nor now did Pierre torment himself with the\nthought of that last desolation; and how the desolate place was to be\nmade flourishing again. He seemed to feel that in his deepest soul,\nlurked an indefinite but potential faith, which could rule in the\ninterregnum of all hereditary beliefs, and circumstantial persuasions;\nnot wholly, he felt, was his soul in anarchy. The indefinite regent had\nassumed the scepter as its right; and Pierre was not entirely given up\nto his grief's utter pillage and sack.\n\nTo a less enthusiastic heart than Pierre's the foremost question in\nrespect to Isabel which would have presented itself, would have been,\n_What_ must I do? But such a question never presented itself to Pierre;\nthe spontaneous responsiveness of his being left no shadow of\ndubiousness as to the direct point he must aim at. But if the object was\nplain, not so the path to it. _How_ must I do it? was a problem for\nwhich at first there seemed no chance of solution. But without being\nentirely aware of it himself, Pierre was one of those spirits, which not\nin a determinate and sordid scrutiny of small pros and cons--but in an\nimpulsive subservience to the god-like dictation of events themselves,\nfind at length the surest solution of perplexities, and the brightest\nprerogative of command. And as for him, _What_ must I do? was a question\nalready answered by the inspiration of the difficulty itself; so now he,\nas it were, unconsciously discharged his mind, for the present, of all\ndistracting considerations concerning _How_ he should do it; assured\nthat the coming interview with Isabel could not but unerringly inspire\nhim there. Still, the inspiration which had thus far directed him had\nnot been entirely mute and undivulging as to many very bitter things\nwhich Pierre foresaw in the wide sea of trouble into which he was\nplunged.\n\nIf it be the sacred province and--by the wisest, deemed--the inestimable\ncompensation of the heavier woes, that they both purge the soul of\ngay-hearted errors and replenish it with a saddened truth; that holy\noffice is not so much accomplished by any covertly inductive reasoning\nprocess, whose original motive is received from the particular\naffliction; as it is the magical effect of the admission into man's\ninmost spirit of a before unexperienced and wholly inexplicable element,\nwhich like electricity suddenly received into any sultry atmosphere of\nthe dark, in all directions splits itself into nimble lances of\npurifying light; which at one and the same instant discharge all the air\nof sluggishness and inform it with an illuminating property; so that\nobjects which before, in the uncertainty of the dark, assumed shadowy\nand romantic outlines, now are lighted up in their substantial\nrealities; so that in these flashing revelations of grief's wonderful\nfire, we see all things as they are; and though, when the electric\nelement is gone, the shadows once more descend, and the false outlines\nof objects again return; yet not with their former power to deceive; for\nnow, even in the presence of the falsest aspects, we still retain the\nimpressions of their immovable true ones, though, indeed, once more\nconcealed.\n\nThus with Pierre. In the joyous young times, ere his great grief came\nupon him, all the objects which surrounded him were concealingly\ndeceptive. Not only was the long-cherished image of his rather now\ntransfigured before him from a green foliaged tree into a blasted trunk,\nbut every other image in his mind attested the universality of that\nelectral light which had darted into his soul. Not even his lovely,\nimmaculate mother, remained entirely untouched, unaltered by the shock.\nAt her changed aspect, when first revealed to him, Pierre had gazed in a\npanic; and now, when the electrical storm had gone by, he retained in\nhis mind, that so suddenly revealed image, with an infinite\nmournfulness. She, who in her less splendid but finer and more spiritual\npart, had ever seemed to Pierre not only as a beautiful saint before\nwhom to offer up his daily orisons, but also as a gentle lady-counsellor\nand confessor, and her revered chamber as a soft satin-hung cabinet and\nconfessional;--his mother was no longer this all-alluring thing; no\nmore, he too keenly felt, could he go to his mother, as to one who\nentirely sympathized with him; as to one before whom he could almost\nunreservedly unbosom himself; as to one capable of pointing out to him\nthe true path where he seemed most beset. Wonderful, indeed, was that\nelectric insight which Fate had now given him into the vital character\nof his mother. She well might have stood all ordinary tests; but when\nPierre thought of the touchstone of his immense strait applied to her\nspirit, he felt profoundly assured that she would crumble into nothing\nbefore it.\n\nShe was a noble creature, but formed chiefly for the gilded prosperities\nof life, and hitherto mostly used to its unruffled serenities; bred and\nexpanded, in all developments, under the sole influence of hereditary\nforms and world-usages. Not his refined, courtly, loving, equable\nmother, Pierre felt, could unreservedly, and like a heaven's heroine,\nmeet the shock of his extraordinary emergency, and applaud, to his\nheart's echo, a sublime resolve, whose execution should call down the\nastonishment and the jeers of the world.\n\nMy mother!--dearest mother!--God hath given me a sister, and unto thee a\ndaughter, and covered her with the world's extremest infamy and scorn,\nthat so I and thou--_thou_, my mother, mightest gloriously own her, and\nacknowledge her, and,---- Nay, nay, groaned Pierre, never, never, could\nsuch syllables be one instant tolerated by her. Then, high-up, and\ntowering, and all-forbidding before Pierre grew the before unthought of\nwonderful edifice of his mother's immense pride;--her pride of birth,\nher pride of affluence, her pride of purity, and all the pride of\nhigh-born, refined, and wealthy Life, and all the Semiramian pride of\nwoman. Then he staggered back upon himself, and only found support in\nhimself. Then Pierre felt that deep in him lurked a divine\nunidentifiableness, that owned no earthly kith or kin. Yet was this\nfeeling entirely lonesome, and orphan-like. Fain, then, for one moment,\nwould he have recalled the thousand sweet illusions of Life; tho'\npurchased at the price of Life's Truth; so that once more he might not\nfeel himself driven out an infant Ishmael into the desert, with no\nmaternal Hagar to accompany and comfort him.\n\nStill, were these emotions without prejudice to his own love for his\nmother, and without the slightest bitterness respecting her; and, least\nof all, there was no shallow disdain toward her of superior virtue. He\ntoo plainly saw, that not his mother had made his mother; but the\nInfinite Haughtiness had first fashioned her; and then the haughty world\nhad further molded her; nor had a haughty Ritual omitted to finish her.\n\nWonderful, indeed, we repeat it, was the electrical insight which Pierre\nnow had into the character of his mother, for not even the vivid\nrecalling of her lavish love for him could suffice to gainsay his sudden\npersuasion. Love me she doth, thought Pierre, but how? Loveth she me\nwith the love past all understanding? that love, which in the loved\none's behalf, would still calmly confront all hate? whose most\ntriumphing hymn, triumphs only by swelling above all opposing taunts and\ndespite?--Loving mother, here have I a loved, but world-infamous sister\nto own;--and if thou lovest me, mother, thy love will love her, too, and\nin the proudest drawing-room take her so much the more proudly by the\nhand.--And as Pierre thus in fancy led Isabel before his mother; and in\nfancy led her away, and felt his tongue cleave to the roof of his mouth,\nwith her transfixing look of incredulous, scornful horror; then Pierre's\nenthusiastic heart sunk in and in, and caved clean away in him, as he so\npoignantly felt his first feeling of the dreary heart-vacancies of the\nconventional life. Oh heartless, proud, ice-gilded world, how I hate\nthee, he thought, that thy tyrannous, insatiate grasp, thus now in my\nbitterest need--thus doth rob me even of my mother; thus doth make me\nnow doubly an orphan, without a green grave to bedew. My tears,--could\nI weep them,--must now be wept in the desolate places; now to me is it,\nas though both father and mother had gone on distant voyages, and,\nreturning, died in unknown seas.\n\nShe loveth me, ay;--but why? Had I been cast in a cripple's mold, how\nthen? Now, do I remember that in her most caressing love, there ever\ngleamed some scaly, glittering folds of pride. Me she loveth with\npride's love; in me she thinks she seeth her own curled and haughty\nbeauty; before my glass she stands,--pride's priestess--and to her\nmirrored image, not to me, she offers up her offerings of kisses. Oh,\nsmall thanks I owe thee, Favorable Goddess, that didst clothe this form\nwith all the beauty of a man, that so thou mightest hide from me all the\ntruth of a man. Now I see that in his beauty a man is snared, and made\nstone-blind, as the worm within its silk. Welcome then be Ugliness and\nPoverty and Infamy, and all ye other crafty ministers of Truth, that\nbeneath the hoods and rags of beggars hide yet the belts and crowns of\nkings. And dimmed be all beauty that must own the clay; and dimmed be\nall wealth, and all delight, and all the annual prosperities of earth,\nthat but gild the links, and stud with diamonds the base rivets and the\nchains of Lies. Oh, now methinks I a little see why of old the men _of_\nTruth went barefoot, girded with a rope, and ever moving under\nmournfulness as underneath a canopy. I remember now those first wise\nwords, wherewith our Savior Christ first spoke in his first speech to\nmen:--'Blessed are the poor in spirit, and blessed they that mourn.' Oh,\nhitherto I have but piled up words; bought books, and bought some small\nexperiences, and builded me in libraries; now I sit down and read. Oh,\nnow I know the night, and comprehend the sorceries of the moon, and all\nthe dark persuadings that have their birth in storms and winds. Oh, not\nlong will Joy abide, when Truth doth come; nor Grief her laggard be.\nWell may this head hang on my breast--it holds too much; well may my\nheart knock at my ribs,--prisoner impatient of his iron bars. Oh, men\nare jailers all; jailers of themselves; and in Opinion's world\nignorantly hold their noblest part a captive to their vilest; as\ndisguised royal Charles when caught by peasants. The heart! the heart!\n'tis God's anointed; let me pursue the heart!\n\n\nII.\n\nBut if the presentiment in Pierre of his mother's pride, as bigotedly\nhostile to the noble design he cherished; if this feeling was so\nwretched to him; far more so was the thought of another and a deeper\nhostility, arising from her more spiritual part. For her pride would not\nbe so scornful, as her wedded memories reject with horror, the\nunmentionable imputation involved in the mere fact of Isabel's\nexistence. In what galleries of conjecture, among what horrible haunting\ntoads and scorpions, would such a revelation lead her? When Pierre\nthought of this, the idea of at all divulging his secret to his mother,\nnot only was made repelling by its hopelessness, as an infirm attack\nupon her citadel of pride, but was made in the last degree inhuman, as\ntorturing her in her tenderest recollections, and desecrating the\nwhitest altar in her sanctuary.\n\nThough the conviction that he must never disclose his secret to his\nmother was originally an unmeditated, and as it were, an inspired one;\nyet now he was almost pains-taking in scrutinizing the entire\ncircumstances of the matter, in order that nothing might be overlooked.\nFor already he vaguely felt, that upon the concealment, or the\ndisclosure of this thing, with reference to his mother, hinged his whole\nfuture course of conduct, his whole earthly weal, and Isabel's. But the\nmore and the more that he pondered upon it, the more and the more fixed\nbecame his original conviction. He considered that in the case of a\ndisclosure, all human probability pointed to his mother's scornful\nrejection of his suit as a pleader for Isabel's honorable admission into\nthe honorable mansion of the Glendinnings. Then in that case,\nunconsciously thought Pierre, I shall have given the deep poison of a\nmiserable truth to my mother, without benefit to any, and positive harm\nto all. And through Pierre's mind there then darted a baleful thought;\nhow that the truth should not always be paraded; how that sometimes a\nlie is heavenly, and truth infernal. Filially infernal, truly, thought\nPierre, if I should by one vile breath of truth, blast my father's\nblessed memory in the bosom of my mother, and plant the sharpest dagger\nof grief in her soul. I will not do it!\n\nBut as this resolution in him opened up so dark and wretched a\nbackground to his view, he strove to think no more of it now, but\npostpone it until the interview with Isabel should have in some way more\ndefinitely shaped his purposes. For, when suddenly encountering the\nshock of new and unanswerable revelations, which he feels must\nrevolutionize all the circumstances of his life, man, at first, ever\nseeks to shun all conscious definitiveness in his thoughts and purposes;\nas assured, that the lines that shall precisely define his present\nmisery, and thereby lay out his future path; these can only be defined\nby sharp stakes that cut into his heart.\n\n\nIII.\n\nMost melancholy of all the hours of earth, is that one long, gray hour,\nwhich to the watcher by the lamp intervenes between the night and day;\nwhen both lamp and watcher, over-tasked, grow sickly in the pallid\nlight; and the watcher, seeking for no gladness in the dawn, sees naught\nbut garish vapors there; and almost invokes a curse upon the public\nday, that shall invade his lonely night of sufferance.\n\nThe one small window of his closet looked forth upon the meadow, and\nacross the river, and far away to the distant heights, storied with the\ngreat deeds of the Glendinnings. Many a time had Pierre sought this\nwindow before sunrise, to behold the blood-red, out-flinging dawn, that\nwould wrap those purple hills as with a banner. But now the morning\ndawned in mist and rain, and came drizzlingly upon his heart. Yet as the\nday advanced, and once more showed to him the accustomed features of his\nroom by that natural light, which, till this very moment, had never\nlighted him but to his joy; now that the day, and not the night, was\nwitness to his woe; now first the dread reality came appallingly upon\nhim. A sense of horrible forlornness, feebleness, impotence, and\ninfinite, eternal desolation possessed him. It was not merely mental,\nbut corporeal also. He could not stand; and when he tried to sit, his\narms fell floorwards as tied to leaden weights. Dragging his ball and\nchain, he fell upon his bed; for when the mind is cast down, only in\nsympathetic proneness can the body rest; whence the bed is often Grief's\nfirst refuge. Half stupefied, as with opium, he fell into the\nprofoundest sleep.\n\nIn an hour he awoke, instantly recalling all the previous night; and now\nfinding himself a little strengthened, and lying so quietly and silently\nthere, almost without bodily consciousness, but his soul unobtrusively\nalert; careful not to break the spell by the least movement of a limb,\nor the least turning of his head. Pierre steadfastly faced his grief,\nand looked deep down into its eyes; and thoroughly, and calmly, and\nsummarily comprehended it now--so at least he thought--and what it\ndemanded from him; and what he must quickly do in its more immediate\nsequences; and what that course of conduct was, which he must pursue in\nthe coming unevadable breakfast interview with his mother; and what, for\nthe present must be his plan with Lucy. His time of thought was brief.\nRising from his bed, he steadied himself upright a moment; and then\ngoing to his writing-desk, in a few at first faltering, but at length\nunlagging lines, traced the following note:\n\n     \"I must ask pardon of you, Lucy, for so strangely absenting myself\n     last night. But you know me well enough to be very sure that I\n     would not have done so without important cause. I was in the street\n     approaching your cottage, when a message reached me, imperatively\n     calling me away. It is a matter which will take up all my time and\n     attention for, possibly, two or three days. I tell you this, now,\n     that you may be prepared for it. And I know that however unwelcome\n     this may be to you, you will yet bear with it for my sake; for,\n     indeed, and indeed, Lucy dear, I would not dream of staying from\n     you so long, unless irresistibly coerced to it. Do not come to the\n     mansion until I come to you; and do not manifest any curiosity or\n     anxiety about me, should you chance in the interval to see my\n     mother in any other place. Keep just as cheerful as if I were by\n     you all the time. Do this, now, I conjure you; and so farewell!\"\n\nHe folded the note, and was about sealing it, when he hesitated a\nmoment, and instantly unfolding it, read it to himself. But he could not\nadequately comprehend his own writing, for a sudden cloud came over him.\nThis passed; and taking his pen hurriedly again, he added the following\npostscript:\n\n     \"Lucy, this note may seem mysterious; but if it shall, I did not\n     mean to make it so; nor do I know that I could have helped it. But\n     the only reason is this, Lucy: the matter which I have alluded to,\n     is of such a nature, that, for the present I stand virtually\n     pledged not to disclose it to any person but those more directly\n     involved in it. But where one can not reveal the thing itself, it\n     only makes it the more mysterious to write round it this way. So\n     merely know me entirely unmenaced in person, and eternally faithful\n     to you; and so be at rest till I see you.\"\n\nThen sealing the note, and ringing the bell, he gave it in strict charge\nto a servant, with directions to deliver it at the earliest practicable\nmoment, and not wait for any answer. But as the messenger was departing\nthe chamber, he called him back, and taking the sealed note again, and\nhollowing it in his hand, scrawled inside of it in pencil the following\nwords: \"Don't write me; don't inquire for me;\" and then returned it to\nthe man, who quitted him, leaving Pierre rooted in thought in the middle\nof the room.\n\nBut he soon roused himself, and left the mansion; and seeking the cool,\nrefreshing meadow stream, where it formed a deep and shady pool, he\nbathed; and returning invigorated to his chamber, changed his entire\ndress; in the little trifling concernments of his toilette, striving\nutterly to banish all thought of that weight upon his soul. Never did he\narray himself with more solicitude for effect. It was one of his fond\nmother's whims to perfume the lighter contents of his wardrobe; and it\nwas one of his own little femininenesses--of the sort sometimes\ncuriously observable in very robust-bodied and big-souled men, as\nMohammed, for example--to be very partial to all pleasant essences. So\nthat when once more he left the mansion in order to freshen his cheek\nanew to meet the keen glance of his mother--to whom the secret of his\npossible pallor could not be divulged; Pierre went forth all redolent;\nbut alas! his body only the embalming cerements of his buried dead\nwithin.\n\n\nIV.\n\nHis stroll was longer than he meant; and when he returned up the Linden\nwalk leading to the breakfast-room, and ascended the piazza steps, and\nglanced into the wide window there, he saw his mother seated not far\nfrom the table; her face turned toward his own; and heard her gay voice,\nand peculiarly light and buoyant laugh, accusing him, and not her, of\nbeing the morning's laggard now. Dates was busy among some spoons and\nnapkins at a side-stand.\n\nSummoning all possible cheerfulness to his face, Pierre entered the\nroom. Remembering his carefulness in bathing and dressing; and knowing\nthat there is no air so calculated to give bloom to the cheek as that of\na damply fresh, cool, and misty morning, Pierre persuaded himself that\nsmall trace would now be found on him of his long night of watching.\n\n'Good morning, sister;--Such a famous stroll! I have been all the way\nto---- '\n\n'Where? good heavens! where? for such a look as that!--why, Pierre,\nPierre? what ails thee? Dates, I will touch the bell presently.'\n\nAs the good servitor fumbled for a moment among the napkins, as if\nunwilling to stir so summarily from his accustomed duty, and not without\nsome of a well and long-tried old domestic's vague, intermitted\nmurmuring, at being wholly excluded from a matter of family interest;\nMrs. Glendinning kept her fixed eye on Pierre, who, unmindful that the\nbreakfast was not yet entirely ready, seating himself at the table,\nbegan helping himself--though but nervously enough--to the cream and\nsugar. The moment the door closed on Dates, the mother sprang to her\nfeet, and threw her arms around her son; but in that embrace, Pierre\nmiserably felt that their two hearts beat not together in such unison as\nbefore.\n\n'What haggard thing possesses thee, my son? Speak, this is\nincomprehensible! Lucy;--fie!--not she?--no love-quarrel there;--speak,\nspeak, my darling boy!\n\n'My dear sister,' began Pierre.\n\n'Sister me not, now, Pierre;--I am thy mother.'\n\n'Well, then, dear mother, thou art quite as incomprehensible to me as I\nto---- '\n\n'Talk faster, Pierre--this calmness freezes me. Tell me; for, by my\nsoul, something most wonderful must have happened to thee. Thou art my\nson, and I command thee. It is not Lucy; it is something else. Tell me.'\n\n'My dear mother,' said Pierre, impulsively moving his chair backward\nfrom the table, 'if thou wouldst only believe me when I say it, I have\nreally nothing to tell thee. Thou knowest that sometimes, when I happen\nto feel very foolishly studious and philosophical, I sit up late in my\nchamber; and then, regardless of the hour, foolishly run out into the\nair, for a long stroll across the meadows. I took such a stroll last\nnight; and had but little time left for napping afterward; and what nap\nI had I was none the better for. But I won't be so silly again, soon; so\ndo, dearest mother, stop looking at me, and let us to breakfast.--Dates!\nTouch the bell there, sister.'\n\n'Stay, Pierre!--There is a heaviness in this hour. I feel, I know, that\nthou art deceiving me;--perhaps I erred in seeking to wrest thy secret\nfrom thee; but believe me, my son, I never thought thou hadst any secret\nthing from me, except thy first love for Lucy--and that, my own\nwomanhood tells me, was most pardonable and right. But now, what can it\nbe? Pierre, Pierre! consider well before thou determinest upon\nwithholding confidence from me. I am thy mother. It may prove a fatal\nthing. Can that be good and virtuous, Pierre, which shrinks from a\nmother's knowledge? Let us not loose hands so, Pierre; thy confidence\nfrom me, mine goes from thee. Now, shall I touch the bell?'\n\nPierre, who had thus far been vainly seeking to occupy his hands with\nhis cap and spoon; he now paused, and unconsciously fastened a\nspeechless glance of mournfulness upon his mother. Again he felt\npresentiments of his mother's newly-revealed character. He foresaw the\nsupposed indignation of her wounded pride; her gradually estranged\naffections thereupon; he knew her firmness, and her exaggerated ideas of\nthe inalienable allegiance of a son. He trembled to think, that now\nindeed was come the first initial moment of his heavy trial. But though\nhe knew all the significance of his mother's attitude, as she stood\nbefore him, intently eying him, with one hand upon the bell-cord; and\nthough he felt that the same opening of the door that should now admit\nDates, could not but give eternal exit to all confidence between him and\nhis mother; and though he felt, too, that this was his mother's latent\nthought; nevertheless, he was girded up in his well-considered\nresolution.\n\n\"Pierre, Pierre! shall I touch the bell?\"\n\n\"Mother, stay!--yes do, sister.\"\n\nThe bell was rung; and at the summons Dates entered; and looking with\nsome significance at Mrs. Glendinning, said,--\"His Reverence has come,\nmy mistress, and is now in the west parlor.\"\n\n\"Show Mr. Falsgrave in here immediately; and bring up the coffee; did I\nnot tell you I expected him to breakfast this morning?\"\n\n\"Yes, my mistress; but I thought that--that--just then\"--glancing\nalarmedly from mother to son.\n\n\"Oh, my good Dates, nothing has happened,\" cried Mrs. Glendinning,\nlightly, and with a bitter smile, looking toward her son,--\"show Mr.\nFalsgrave in. Pierre, I did not see thee, to tell thee, last night; but\nMr. Falsgrave breakfasts with us by invitation. I was at the parsonage\nyesterday, to see him about that wretched affair of Delly, and we are\nfinally to settle upon what is to be done this morning. But my mind is\nmade up concerning Ned; no such profligate shall pollute this place;\nnor shall the disgraceful Delly.\"\n\nFortunately, the abrupt entrance of the clergyman, here turned away\nattention from the sudden pallor of Pierre's countenance, and afforded\nhim time to rally.\n\n\"Good morning, madam; good morning, sir;\" said Mr. Falsgrave, in a\nsingularly mild, flute-like voice, turning to Mrs. Glendinning and her\nson; the lady receiving him with answering cordiality, but Pierre too\nembarrassed just then to be equally polite. As for one brief moment Mr.\nFalsgrave stood before the pair, ere taking the offered chair from\nDates, his aspect was eminently attractive.\n\nThere are certain ever-to-be-cherished moments in the life of almost any\nman, when a variety of little foregoing circumstances all unite to make\nhim temporarily oblivious of whatever may be hard and bitter in his\nlife, and also to make him most amiably and ruddily disposed; when the\nscene and company immediately before him are highly agreeable; and if at\nsuch a time he chance involuntarily to put himself into a scenically\nfavorable bodily posture; then, in that posture, however transient, thou\nshalt catch the noble stature of his Better Angel; catch a heavenly\nglimpse of the latent heavenliness of man. It was so with Mr. Falsgrave\nnow. Not a house within a circuit of fifty miles that he preferred\nentering before the mansion-house of Saddle Meadows; and though the\nbusiness upon which he had that morning come, was any thing but\nrelishable to him, yet that subject was not in his memory then. Before\nhim stood united in one person, the most exalted lady and the most\nstoried beauty of all the country round; and the finest, most\nintellectual, and most congenial youth he knew. Before him also, stood\nthe generous foundress and the untiring patroness of the beautiful\nlittle marble church, consecrated by the good Bishop, not four years\ngone by. Before him also, stood--though in polite disguise--the same\nuntiring benefactress, from whose purse, he could not help suspecting,\ncame a great part of his salary, nominally supplied by the rental of the\npews. He had been invited to breakfast; a meal, which, in a\nwell-appointed country family, is the most cheerful circumstance of\ndaily life; he smelt all Java's spices in the aroma from the silver\ncoffee-urn; and well he knew, what liquid deliciousness would soon come\nfrom it. Besides all this, and many more minutenesses of the kind, he\nwas conscious that Mrs. Glendinning entertained a particular partiality\nfor him (though not enough to marry him, as he ten times knew by very\nbitter experience), and that Pierre was not behindhand in his esteem.\n\nAnd the clergyman was well worthy of it. Nature had been royally\nbountiful to him in his person. In his happier moments, as the present,\nhis face was radiant with a courtly, but mild benevolence; his person\nwas nobly robust and dignified; while the remarkable smallness of his\nfeet, and the almost infantile delicacy, and vivid whiteness and purity\nof his hands, strikingly contrasted with his fine girth and stature. For\nin countries like America, where there is no distinct hereditary caste\nof gentlemen, whose order is factitiously perpetuated as race-horses and\nlords are in kingly lands; and especially, in those agricultural\ndistricts, where, of a hundred hands, that drop a ballot for the\nPresidency, ninety-nine shall be of the brownest and the brawniest; in\nsuch districts, this daintiness of the fingers, when united with a\ngenerally manly aspect, assumes a remarkableness unknown in European\nnations.\n\nThis most prepossessing form of the clergyman lost nothing by the\ncharacter of his manners, which were polished and unobtrusive, but\npeculiarly insinuating, without the least appearance of craftiness or\naffectation. Heaven had given him his fine, silver-keyed person for a\nflute to play on in this world; and he was nearly the perfect master of\nit. His graceful motions had the undulatoriness of melodious sounds.\nYou almost thought you heard, not saw him. So much the wonderful, yet\nnatural gentleman he seemed, that more than once Mrs. Glendinning had\nheld him up to Pierre as a splendid example of the polishing and\ngentlemanizing influences of Christianity upon the mind and manners;\ndeclaring, that extravagant as it might seem, she had always been of his\nfather's fancy,--that no man could be a complete gentleman, and preside\nwith dignity at his own table, unless he partook of the church's\nsacraments. Nor in Mr. Falsgrave's case was this maxim entirely absurd.\nThe child of a poor northern farmer who had wedded a pretty sempstress,\nthe clergyman had no heraldic line of ancestry to show, as warrant and\nexplanation of his handsome person and gentle manners; the first, being\nthe willful partiality of nature; and the second, the consequence of a\nscholastic life, attempered by a taste for the choicest female society,\nhowever small, which he had always regarded as the best relish of\nexistence. If now his manners thus responded to his person, his mind\nanswered to them both, and was their finest illustration. Besides his\neloquent persuasiveness in the pulpit, various fugitive papers upon\nsubjects of nature, art, and literature, attested not only his refined\naffinity to all beautiful things, visible or invisible; but likewise\nthat he possessed a genius for celebrating such things, which in a less\nindolent and more ambitious nature, would have been sure to have gained\na fair poet's name ere now. For this Mr. Falsgrave was just hovering\nupon his prime of years; a period which, in such a man, is the sweetest,\nand, to a mature woman, by far the most attractive of manly life. Youth\nhas not yet completely gone with its beauty, grace, and strength; nor\nhas age at all come with its decrepitudes; though the finest undrossed\nparts of it--its mildness and its wisdom--have gone on before, as\ndecorous chamberlains precede the sedan of some crutched king.\n\nSuch was this Mr. Falsgrave, who now sat at Mrs. Glendinning's breakfast\ntable, a corner of one of that lady's generous napkins so inserted into\nhis snowy bosom, that its folds almost invested him as far down as the\ntable's edge; and he seemed a sacred priest, indeed, breakfasting in his\nsurplice.\n\n\"Pray, Mr. Falsgrave,\" said Mrs. Glendinning, \"break me off a bit of\nthat roll.\"\n\nWhether or not his sacerdotal experiences had strangely refined and\nspiritualized so simple a process as breaking bread; or whether it was\nfrom the spotless aspect of his hands: certain it is that Mr. Falsgrave\nacquitted himself on this little occasion, in a manner that beheld of\nold by Leonardo, might have given that artist no despicable hint\ntouching his celestial painting. As Pierre regarded him, sitting there\nso mild and meek; such an image of white-browed and white-handed, and\nnapkined immaculateness; and as he felt the gentle humane radiations\nwhich came from the clergyman's manly and rounded beautifulness; and as\nhe remembered all the good that he knew of this man, and all the good\nthat he had heard of him, and could recall no blemish in his character;\nand as in his own concealed misery and forlornness, he contemplated the\nopen benevolence, and beaming excellent-heartedness of Mr. Falsgrave,\nthe thought darted through his mind, that if any living being was\ncapable of giving him worthy counsel in his strait; and if to any one he\ncould go with Christian propriety and some small hopefulness, that\nperson was the one before him.\n\n\"Pray, Mr. Glendinning,\" said the clergyman, pleasantly, as Pierre was\nsilently offering to help him to some tongue--\"don't let me rob you of\nit--pardon me, but you seem to have very little yourself this morning, I\nthink. An execrable pun, I know: but\"--turning toward Mrs.\nGlendinning--\"when one is made to feel very happy, one is somehow apt to\nsay very silly things. Happiness and silliness--ah, it's a suspicious\ncoincidence.\"\n\n\"Mr. Falsgrave,\" said the hostess--\"Your cup is empty. Dates!--We were\ntalking yesterday, Mr. Falsgrave, concerning that vile fellow, Ned.\"\n\n\"Well, Madam,\" responded the gentleman, a very little uneasily.\n\n\"He shall not stay on any ground of mine; my mind is made up, sir.\nInfamous man!--did he not have a wife as virtuous and beautiful now, as\nwhen I first gave her away at your altar?--It was the sheerest and most\ngratuitous profligacy.\"\n\nThe clergyman mournfully and assentingly moved his head.\n\n\"Such men,\" continued the lady, flushing with the sincerest\nindignation--\"are to my way of thinking more detestable than murderers.\"\n\n\"That is being a little hard upon them, my dear Madam,\" said Mr.\nFalsgrave, mildly.\n\n\"Do you not think so, Pierre\"--now, said the lady, turning earnestly\nupon her son--\"is not the man, who has sinned like that Ned, worse than\na murderer? Has he not sacrificed one woman completely, and given infamy\nto another--to both of them--for their portion. If his own legitimate\nboy should now hate him, I could hardly blame him.\"\n\n\"My dear Madam,\" said the clergyman, whose eyes having followed Mrs.\nGlendinning's to her son's countenance, and marking a strange\ntrepidation there, had thus far been earnestly scrutinizing Pierre's not\nwholly repressible emotion;--\"My dear Madam,\" he said, slightly bending\nover his stately episcopal-looking person--\"Virtue has, perhaps, an\nover-ardent champion in you; you grow too warm; but Mr. Glendinning,\nhere, he seems to grow too cold. Pray, favor us with your views, Mr.\nGlendinning?\"\n\n\"I will not think now of the man,\" said Pierre, slowly, and looking away\nfrom both his auditors--\"let us speak of Delly and her infant--she has,\nor had one, I have loosely heard;--their case is miserable indeed.\"\n\n\"The mother deserves it,\" said the lady, inflexibly--\"and the\nchild--Reverend sir, what are the words of the Bible?\"\n\n\"'The sins of the father shall be visited upon the children to the third\ngeneration,'\" said Mr. Falsgrave, with some slight reluctance in his\ntones. \"But Madam, that does not mean, that the community is in any way\nto take the infamy of the children into their own voluntary hands, as\nthe conscious delegated stewards of God's inscrutable dispensations.\nBecause it is declared that the infamous consequences of sin shall be\nhereditary, it does not follow that our personal and active loathing of\nsin, should descend from the sinful sinner to his sinless child.\"\n\n\"I understand you, sir,\" said Mrs. Glendinning, coloring slightly, \"you\nthink me too censorious. But if we entirely forget the parentage of the\nchild, and every way receive the child as we would any other, feel for\nit in all respects the same, and attach no sign of ignominy to it--how\nthen is the Bible dispensation to be fulfilled? Do we not then put\nourselves in the way of its fulfilment, and is that wholly free from\nimpiety?\"\n\nHere it was the clergyman's turn to color a little, and there was a just\nperceptible tremor of the under lip.\n\n\"Pardon me,\" continued the lady, courteously, \"but if there is any one\nblemish in the character of the Reverend Mr. Falsgrave, it is that the\nbenevolence of his heart, too much warps in him the holy rigor of our\nChurch's doctrines. For my part, as I loathe the man, I loathe the\nwoman, and never desire to behold the child.\"\n\nA pause ensued, during which it was fortunate for Pierre, that by the\nsocial sorcery of such occasions as the present, the eyes of all three\nwere intent upon the cloth; all three for the moment, giving loose to\ntheir own distressful meditations upon the subject in debate, and Mr.\nFalsgrave vexedly thinking that the scene was becoming a little\nembarrassing.\n\nPierre was the first who spoke; as before, he steadfastly kept his eyes\naway from both his auditors; but though he did not designate his mother,\nsomething in the tone of his voice showed that what he said was\naddressed more particularly to her.\n\n\"Since we seem to have been strangely drawn into the ethical aspect of\nthis melancholy matter,\" said he, \"suppose we go further in it; and let\nme ask, how it should be between the legitimate and the illegitimate\nchild--children of one father--when they shall have passed their\nchildhood?\"\n\nHere the clergyman quickly raising his eyes, looked as surprised and\nsearchingly at Pierre, as his politeness would permit.\n\n\"Upon my word\"--said Mrs. Glendinning, hardly less surprised, and making\nno attempt at disguising it--\"this is an odd question you put; you have\nbeen more attentive to the subject than I had fancied. But what do you\nmean, Pierre? I did not entirely understand you.\"\n\n\"Should the legitimate child shun the illegitimate, when one father is\nfather to both?\" rejoined Pierre, bending his head still further over\nhis plate.\n\nThe clergyman looked a little down again, and was silent; but still\nturned his head slightly sideways toward his hostess, as if awaiting\nsome reply to Pierre from her.\n\n\"Ask the world, Pierre\"--said Mrs. Glendinning warmly--\"and ask your own\nheart.\"\n\n\"My own heart? I will, Madam\"--said Pierre, now looking up steadfastly;\n\"but what do _you_ think, Mr. Falsgrave?\" letting his glance drop\nagain--\"should the one shun the other; should the one refuse his highest\nsympathy and perfect love for the other, especially if that other be\ndeserted by all the rest of the world? What think you would have been\nour blessed Savior's thoughts on such a matter? And what was that he so\nmildly said to the adulteress?\"\n\nA swift color passed over the clergyman's countenance, suffusing even\nhis expanded brow; he slightly moved in his chair, and looked\nuncertainly from Pierre to his mother. He seemed as a shrewd,\nbenevolent-minded man, placed between opposite opinions--merely\nopinions--who, with a full, and doubly-differing persuasion in himself,\nstill refrains from uttering it, because of an irresistible dislike to\nmanifesting an absolute dissent from the honest convictions of any\nperson, whom he both socially and morally esteems.\n\n\"Well, what do you reply to my son?\"--said Mrs. Glendinning at last.\n\n\"Madam and sir\"--said the clergyman, now regaining his entire\nself-possession. \"It is one of the social disadvantages which we of the\npulpit labor under, that we are supposed to know more of the moral\nobligations of humanity than other people. And it is a still more\nserious disadvantage to the world, that our unconsidered, conversational\nopinions on the most complex problems of ethics, are too apt to be\nconsidered authoritative, as indirectly proceeding from the church\nitself. Now, nothing can be more erroneous than such notions; and\nnothing so embarrasses me, and deprives me of that entire serenity,\nwhich is indispensable to the delivery of a careful opinion on moral\nsubjects, than when sudden questions of this sort are put to me in\ncompany. Pardon this long preamble, for I have little more to say. It is\nnot every question, however direct, Mr. Glendinning, which can be\nconscientiously answered with a yes or no. Millions of circumstances\nmodify all moral questions; so that though conscience may possibly\ndictate freely in any known special case; yet, by one universal maxim,\nto embrace all moral contingencies,--this is not only impossible, but\nthe attempt, to me, seems foolish.\"\n\nAt this instant, the surplice-like napkin dropped from the clergyman's\nbosom, showing a minute but exquisitely cut cameo brooch, representing\nthe allegorical union of the serpent and dove. It had been the gift of\nan appreciative friend, and was sometimes worn on secular occasions like\nthe present.\n\n\"I agree with you, sir\"--said Pierre, bowing. \"I fully agree with you.\nAnd now, madam, let us talk of something else.\"\n\n\"You madam me very punctiliously this morning, Mr. Glendinning\"--said\nhis mother, half-bitterly smiling, and half-openly offended, but still\nmore surprised at Pierre's frigid demeanor.\n\n\"'Honor thy father and mother;'\" said Pierre--\"_both_ father and\nmother,\" he unconsciously added. \"And now that it strikes me, Mr.\nFalsgrave, and now that we have become so strangely polemical this\nmorning, let me say, that as that command is justly said to be the only\none with a promise, so it seems to be without any contingency in the\napplication. It would seem--would it not, sir?--that the most deceitful\nand hypocritical of fathers should be equally honored by the son, as the\npurest.\"\n\n\"So it would certainly seem, according to the strict letter of the\nDecalogue--certainly.\"\n\n\"And do you think, sir, that it should be so held, and so applied in\nactual life? For instance, should I honor my father, if I knew him to be\na seducer?\"\n\n\"Pierre! Pierre!\" said his mother, profoundly coloring, and half rising;\n\"there is no need of these argumentative assumptions. You very immensely\nforget yourself this morning.\"\n\n\"It is merely the interest of the general question, Madam,\" returned\nPierre, coldly. \"I am sorry. If your former objection does not apply\nhere, Mr. Falsgrave, will you favor me with an answer to my question?\"\n\n\"There you are again, Mr. Glendinning,\" said the clergyman, thankful for\nPierre's hint; \"that is another question in morals absolutely incapable\nof a definite answer, which shall be universally applicable.\" Again the\nsurplice-like napkin chanced to drop.\n\n\"I am tacitly rebuked again then, sir,\" said Pierre, slowly; \"but I\nadmit that perhaps you are again in the right. And now, Madam, since Mr.\nFalsgrave and yourself have a little business together, to which my\npresence is not necessary, and may possibly prove quite dispensable,\npermit me to leave you. I am going off on a long ramble, so you need not\nwait dinner for me. Good morning, Mr. Falsgrave; good morning, Madam,\"\nlooking toward his mother.\n\nAs the door closed upon him, Mr. Falsgrave spoke--\"Mr. Glendinning looks\na little pale to-day: has he been ill?\"\n\n\"Not that I know of,\" answered the lady, indifferently, \"but did you\never see young gentleman so stately as he was! Extraordinary!\" she\nmurmured; \"what can this mean--Madam--Madam? But your cup is empty\nagain, sir\"--reaching forth her hand.\n\n\"No more, no more, Madam,\" said the clergyman.\n\n\"Madam? pray don't Madam me any more, Mr. Falsgrave; I have taken a\nsudden hatred to that title.\"\n\n\"Shall it be Your Majesty, then?\" said the clergyman, gallantly; \"the\nMay Queens are so styled, and so should be the Queens of October.\"\n\nHere the lady laughed. \"Come,\" said she, \"let us go into another room,\nand settle the affair of that infamous Ned and that miserable Delly.\"\n\n\nV.\n\nThe swiftness and unrepellableness of the billow which, with its first\nshock, had so profoundly whelmed Pierre, had not only poured into his\nsoul a tumult of entirely new images and emotions, but, for the time, it\nalmost entirely drove out of him all previous ones. The things that any\nway bore directly upon the pregnant fact of Isabel, these things were\nall animate and vividly present to him; but the things which bore more\nupon himself, and his own personal condition, as now forever involved\nwith his sister's, these things were not so animate and present to him.\nThe conjectured past of Isabel took mysterious hold of his father;\ntherefore, the idea of his father tyrannized over his imagination; and\nthe possible future of Isabel, as so essentially though indirectly\ncompromisable by whatever course of conduct his mother might hereafter\nignorantly pursue with regard to himself, as henceforth, through Isabel,\nforever altered to her; these considerations brought his mother with\nblazing prominence before him.\n\nHeaven, after all, hath been a little merciful to the miserable man; not\nentirely untempered to human nature are the most direful blasts of Fate.\nWhen on all sides assailed by prospects of disaster, whose final ends\nare in terror hidden from it, the soul of man--either, as instinctively\nconvinced that it can not battle with the whole host at once; or else,\nbenevolently blinded to the larger arc of the circle which menacingly\nhems it in;--whichever be the truth, the soul of man, thus surrounded,\ncan not, and does never intelligently confront the totality of its\nwretchedness. The bitter drug is divided into separate draughts for him:\nto-day he takes one part of his woe; to-morrow he takes more; and so on,\ntill the last drop is drunk.\n\nNot that in the despotism of other things, the thought of Lucy, and the\nunconjecturable suffering into which she might so soon be plunged, owing\nto the threatening uncertainty of the state of his own future, as now in\ngreat part and at all hazards dedicated to Isabel; not that this thought\nhad thus far been alien to him. Icy-cold, and serpent-like, it had\noverlayingly crawled in upon his other shuddering imaginings; but those\nother thoughts would as often upheave again, and absorb it into\nthemselves, so that it would in that way soon disappear from his\ncotemporary apprehension. The prevailing thoughts connected with Isabel\nhe now could front with prepared and open eyes; but the occasional\nthought of Lucy, when _that_ started up before him, he could only cover\nhis bewildered eyes with his bewildered hands. Nor was this the\ncowardice of selfishness, but the infinite sensitiveness of his soul. He\ncould bear the agonizing thought of Isabel, because he was immediately\nresolved to help her, and to assuage a fellow-being's grief; but, as\nyet, he could not bear the thought of Lucy, because the very resolution\nthat promised balm to Isabel obscurely involved the everlasting peace of\nLucy, and therefore aggravatingly threatened a far more than\nfellow-being's happiness.\n\nWell for Pierre it was, that the penciling presentiments of his mind\nconcerning Lucy as quickly erased as painted their tormenting images.\nStanding half-befogged upon the mountain of his Fate, all that part of\nthe wide panorama was wrapped in clouds to him; but anon those\nconcealings slid aside, or rather, a quick rent was made in them;\ndisclosing far below, half-vailed in the lower mist, the winding\ntranquil vale and stream of Lucy's previous happy life; through the\nswift cloud-rent he caught one glimpse of her expectant and angelic face\npeeping from the honey-suckled window of her cottage; and the next\ninstant the stormy pinions of the clouds locked themselves over it\nagain; and all was hidden as before; and all went confused in whirling\nrack and vapor as before. Only by unconscious inspiration, caught from\nthe agencies invisible to man, had he been enabled to write that first\nobscurely announcing note to Lucy; wherein the collectedness, and the\nmildness, and the calmness, were but the natural though insidious\nprecursors of the stunning bolts on bolts to follow.\n\nBut, while thus, for the most part wrapped from his consciousness and\nvision, still, the condition of his Lucy, as so deeply affected now, was\nstill more and more disentangling and defining itself from out its\nnearer mist, and even beneath the general upper fog. For when\nunfathomably stirred, the subtler elements of man do not always reveal\nthemselves in the concocting act; but, as with all other potencies, show\nthemselves chiefly in their ultimate resolvings and results. Strange\nwild work, and awfully symmetrical and reciprocal, was that now going on\nwithin the self-apparently chaotic breast of Pierre. As in his own\nconscious determinations, the mournful Isabel was being snatched from\nher captivity of world-wide abandonment; so, deeper down in the more\nsecret chambers of his unsuspecting soul, the smiling Lucy, now as dead\nand ashy pale, was being bound a ransom for Isabel's salvation. Eye for\neye, and tooth for tooth. Eternally inexorable and unconcerned is Fate,\na mere heartless trader in men's joys and woes.\n\nNor was this general and spontaneous self-concealment of all the most\nmomentous interests of his love, as irretrievably involved with Isabel\nand his resolution respecting her; nor was this unbidden thing in him\nunseconded by the prompting of his own conscious judgment, when in the\ntyranny of the master-event itself, that judgment was permitted some\ninfrequent play. He could not but be aware, that all meditation on Lucy\nnow was worse than useless. How could he now map out his and her young\nlife-chart, when all was yet misty-white with creamy breakers! Still\nmore: divinely dedicated as he felt himself to be; with divine commands\nupon him to befriend and champion Isabel, through all conceivable\ncontingencies of Time and Chance; how could he insure himself against\nthe insidious inroads of self-interest, and hold intact all his\nunselfish magnanimities, if once he should permit the distracting\nthought of Lucy to dispute with Isabel's the pervading possession of his\nsoul?\n\nAnd if--though but unconsciously as yet--he was almost superhumanly\nprepared to make a sacrifice of all objects dearest to him, and cut\nhimself away from his last hopes of common happiness, should they cross\nhis grand enthusiast resolution;--if this was so with him; then, how\nlight as gossamer, and thinner and more impalpable than airiest threads\nof gauze, did he hold all common conventional regardings;--his\nhereditary duty to his mother, his pledged worldly faith and honor to\nthe hand and seal of his affiancement?\n\nNot that at present all these things did thus present themselves to\nPierre; but these things were foetally forming in him. Impregnations\nfrom high enthusiasms he had received; and the now incipient offspring\nwhich so stirred, with such painful, vague vibrations in his soul; this,\nin its mature development, when it should at last come forth in living\ndeeds, would scorn all personal relationship with Pierre, and hold his\nheart's dearest interests for naught.\n\nThus, in the Enthusiast to Duty, the heaven-begotten Christ is born; and\nwill not own a mortal parent, and spurns and rends all mortal bonds.\n\n\nVI.\n\nOne night, one day, and a small part of the one ensuing evening had been\ngiven to Pierre to prepare for the momentous interview with Isabel.\n\nNow, thank God, thought Pierre, the night is past,--the night of Chaos\nand of Doom; the day only, and the skirt of evening now remain. May\nheaven new-string my soul, and confirm me in the Christ-like feeling I\nfirst felt. May I, in all my least shapeful thoughts still square myself\nby the inflexible rule of holy right. Let no unmanly, mean temptation\ncross my path this day; let no base stone lie in it. This day I will\nforsake the censuses of men, and seek the suffrages of the god-like\npopulation of the trees, which now seem to me a nobler race than man.\nTheir high foliage shall drop heavenliness upon me; my feet in contact\nwith their mighty roots, immortal vigor shall so steal into me. Guide\nme, gird me, guard me, this day, ye sovereign powers! Bind me in bonds I\ncan not break; remove all sinister allurings from me; eternally this day\ndeface in me the detested and distorted images of all the convenient\nlies and duty-subterfuges of the diving and ducking moralities of this\nearth. Fill me with consuming fire for them; to my life's muzzle, cram\nme with your own intent. Let no world-syren come to sing to me this day,\nand wheedle from me my undauntedness. I cast my eternal die this day, ye\npowers. On my strong faith in ye Invisibles, I stake three whole\nfelicities, and three whole lives this day. If ye forsake me\nnow,--farewell to Faith, farewell to Truth, farewell to God; exiled for\naye from God and man, I shall declare myself an equal power with both;\nfree to make war on Night and Day, and all thoughts and things of mind\nand matter, which the upper and the nether firmaments do clasp!\n\n\nVII.\n\nBut Pierre, though, charged with the fire of all divineness, his\ncontaining thing was made of clay. Ah, muskets the gods have made to\ncarry infinite combustions, and yet made them of clay!\n\nSave me from being bound to Truth, liege lord, as I am now. How shall I\nsteal yet further into Pierre, and show how this heavenly fire was\nhelped to be contained in him, by mere contingent things, and things\nthat he knew not. But I shall follow the endless, winding way,--the\nflowing river in the cave of man; careless whither I be led, reckless\nwhere I land.\n\nWas not the face--though mutely mournful--beautiful, bewitchingly? How\nunfathomable those most wondrous eyes of supernatural light! In those\ncharmed depths, Grief and Beauty plunged and dived together. So\nbeautiful, so mystical, so bewilderingly alluring; speaking of a\nmournfulness infinitely sweeter and more attractive than all\nmirthfulness; that face of glorious suffering; that face of touching\nloveliness; that face was Pierre's own sister's; that face was Isabel's;\nthat face Pierre had visibly seen; into those same supernatural eyes\nour Pierre had looked. Thus, already, and ere the proposed encounter, he\nwas assured that, in a transcendent degree, womanly beauty, and not\nwomanly ugliness, invited him to champion the right. Be naught concealed\nin this book of sacred truth. How, if accosted in some squalid lane, a\nhumped, and crippled, hideous girl should have snatched his garment's\nhem, with--\"Save me, Pierre--love me, own me, brother; I am thy\nsister!\"--Ah, if man were wholly made in heaven, why catch we\nhell-glimpses? Why in the noblest marble pillar that stands beneath the\nall-comprising vault, ever should we descry the sinister vein? We lie in\nnature very close to God; and though, further on, the stream may be\ncorrupted by the banks it flows through; yet at the fountain's rim,\nwhere mankind stand, there the stream infallibly bespeaks the fountain.\n\nSo let no censorious word be here hinted of mortal Pierre. Easy for me\nto slyly hide these things, and always put him before the eye as perfect\nas immaculate; unsusceptible to the inevitable nature and the lot of\ncommon men. I am more frank with Pierre than the best men are with\nthemselves. I am all unguarded and magnanimous with Pierre; therefore\nyou see his weakness, and therefore only. In reserves men build imposing\ncharacters; not in revelations. He who shall be wholly honest, though\nnobler than Ethan Allen; that man shall stand in danger of the meanest\nmortal's scorn.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK VI.\n\nISABEL, AND THE FIRST PART OF THE STORY OF ISABEL.\n\n\nI.\n\nHalf wishful that the hour would come; half shuddering that every moment\nit still came nearer and more near to him; dry-eyed, but wet with that\ndark day's rain; at fall of eve, Pierre emerged from long wanderings in\nthe primeval woods of Saddle Meadows, and for one instant stood\nmotionless upon their sloping skirt.\n\nWhere he stood was in the rude wood road, only used by sledges in the\ntime of snow; just where the out-posted trees formed a narrow arch, and\nfancied gateway leading upon the far, wide pastures sweeping down toward\nthe lake. In that wet and misty eve the scattered, shivering pasture\nelms seemed standing in a world inhospitable, yet rooted by inscrutable\nsense of duty to their place. Beyond, the lake lay in one sheet of\nblankness and of dumbness, unstirred by breeze or breath; fast bound\nthere it lay, with not life enough to reflect the smallest shrub or\ntwig. Yet in that lake was seen the duplicate, stirless sky above. Only\nin sunshine did that lake catch gay, green images; and these but\ndisplaced the imaged muteness of the unfeatured heavens.\n\nOn both sides, in the remoter distance, and also far beyond the mild\nlake's further shore, rose the long, mysterious mountain masses; shaggy\nwith pines and hemlocks, mystical with nameless, vapory exhalations, and\nin that dim air black with dread and gloom. At their base, profoundest\nforests lay entranced, and from their far owl-haunted depths of caves\nand rotted leaves, and unused and unregarded inland overgrowth of\ndecaying wood--for smallest sticks of which, in other climes many a\npauper was that moment perishing; from out the infinite inhumanities of\nthose profoundest forests, came a moaning, muttering, roaring,\nintermitted, changeful sound: rain-shakings of the palsied trees,\nslidings of rocks undermined, final crashings of long-riven boughs, and\ndevilish gibberish of the forest-ghosts.\n\nBut more near, on the mild lake's hither shore, where it formed a long\nsemi-circular and scooped acclivity of corn-fields, there the small and\nlow red farm-house lay; its ancient roof a bed of brightest mosses; its\nnorth front (from the north the moss-wind blows), also moss-incrusted,\nlike the north side of any vast-trunked maple in the groves. At one\ngabled end, a tangled arbor claimed support, and paid for it by generous\ngratuities of broad-flung verdure, one viny shaft of which pointed\nitself upright against the chimney-bricks, as if a waving lightning-rod.\nAgainst the other gable, you saw the lowly dairy-shed; its sides close\nnetted with traced Madeira vines; and had you been close enough, peeping\nthrough that imprisoning tracery, and through the light slats barring\nthe little embrasure of a window, you might have seen the gentle and\ncontented captives--the pans of milk, and the snow-white Dutch cheeses\nin a row, and the molds of golden butter, and the jars of lily cream. In\nfront, three straight gigantic lindens stood guardians of this verdant\nspot. A long way up, almost to the ridge-pole of the house, they showed\nlittle foliage; but then, suddenly, as three huge green balloons, they\npoised their three vast, inverted, rounded cones of verdure in the air.\n\nSoon as Pierre's eye rested on the place, a tremor shook him. Not alone\nbecause of Isabel, as there a harborer now, but because of two dependent\nand most strange coincidences which that day's experience had brought to\nhim. He had gone to breakfast with his mother, his heart charged to\noverflowing with presentiments of what would probably be her haughty\ndisposition concerning such a being as Isabel, claiming her maternal\nlove: and lo! the Reverend Mr. Falsgrave enters, and Ned and Delly are\ndiscussed, and that whole sympathetic matter, which Pierre had despaired\nof bringing before his mother in all its ethic bearings, so as\nabsolutely to learn her thoughts upon it, and thereby test his own\nconjectures; all that matter had been fully talked about; so that,\nthrough that strange coincidence, he now perfectly knew his mother's\nmind, and had received forewarnings, as if from heaven, not to make any\npresent disclosure to her. That was in the morning; and now, at eve\ncatching a glimpse of the house where Isabel was harboring, at once he\nrecognized it as the rented farm-house of old Walter Ulver, father to\nthe self-same Delly, forever ruined through the cruel arts of Ned.\n\nStrangest feelings, almost supernatural, now stole into Pierre. With\nlittle power to touch with awe the souls of less susceptible,\nreflective, and poetic beings, such coincidences, however frequently\nthey may recur, ever fill the finer organization with sensations which\ntranscend all verbal renderings. They take hold of life's subtlest\nproblem. With the lightning's flash, the query is spontaneously\npropounded--chance, or God? If too, the mind thus influenced be likewise\na prey to any settled grief, then on all sides the query magnifies, and\nat last takes in the all-comprehending round of things. For ever is it\nseen, that sincere souls in suffering, then most ponder upon final\ncauses. The heart, stirred to its depths, finds correlative sympathy in\nthe head, which likewise is profoundly moved. Before miserable men, when\nintellectual, all the ages of the world pass as in a manacled\nprocession, and all their myriad links rattle in the mournful mystery.\n\nPacing beneath the long-skirting shadows of the elevated wood, waiting\nfor the appointed hour to come, Pierre strangely strove to imagine to\nhimself the scene which was destined to ensue. But imagination utterly\nfailed him here; the reality was too real for him; only the face, the\nface alone now visited him; and so accustomed had he been of late to\nconfound it with the shapes of air, that he almost trembled when he\nthought that face to face, that face must shortly meet his own.\n\nAnd now the thicker shadows begin to fall; the place is lost to him;\nonly the three dim, tall lindens pilot him as he descends the hill,\nhovering upon the house. He knows it not, but his meditative route is\nsinuous; as if that moment his thought's stream was likewise\nserpentining: laterally obstructed by insinuated misgivings as to the\nultimate utilitarian advisability of the enthusiast resolution that was\nhis. His steps decrease in quickness as he comes more nigh, and sees one\nfeeble light struggling in the rustic double-casement. Infallibly he\nknows that his own voluntary steps are taking him forever from the\nbrilliant chandeliers of the mansion of Saddle Meadows, to join company\nwith the wretched rush-lights of poverty and woe. But his sublime\nintuitiveness also paints to him the sun-like glories of god-like truth\nand virtue; which though ever obscured by the dense fogs of earth, still\nshall shine eventually in unclouded radiance, casting illustrative light\nupon the sapphire throne of God.\n\n\nII.\n\nHe stands before the door; the house is steeped in silence; he knocks;\nthe casement light flickers for a moment, and then moves away; within,\nhe hears a door creak on its hinges; then his whole heart beats wildly\nas the outer latch is lifted; and holding the light above her\nsupernatural head, Isabel stands before him. It is herself. No word is\nspoken; no other soul is seen. They enter the room of the double\ncasement; and Pierre sits down, overpowered with bodily faintness and\nspiritual awe. He lifts his eyes to Isabel's gaze of loveliness and\nloneliness; and then a low, sweet, half-sobbing voice of more than\nnatural musicalness is heard:--\n\n\"And so, thou art my brother;--shall I call thee Pierre?\"\n\nSteadfastly, with his one first and last fraternal inquisition of the\nperson of the mystic girl, Pierre now for an instant eyes her; and in\nthat one instant sees in the imploring face, not only the nameless\ntouchingness of that of the sewing-girl, but also the subtler expression\nof the portrait of his then youthful father, strangely translated, and\nintermarryingly blended with some before unknown, foreign feminineness.\nIn one breath, Memory and Prophecy, and Intuition tell him--\"Pierre,\nhave no reserves; no minutest possible doubt;--this being is thy sister;\nthou gazest on thy father's flesh.\"\n\n\"And so thou art my brother!--shall I call thee Pierre?\"\n\nHe sprang to his feet, and caught her in his undoubting arms.\n\n\"Thou art! thou art!\"\n\nHe felt a faint struggling within his clasp; her head drooped against\nhim; his whole form was bathed in the flowing glossiness of her long and\nunimprisoned hair. Brushing the locks aside, he now gazed upon the\ndeath-like beauty of the face, and caught immortal sadness from it. She\nseemed as dead; as suffocated,--the death that leaves most unimpaired\nthe latent tranquillities and sweetnesses of the human countenance.\n\nHe would have called aloud for succor; but the slow eyes opened upon\nhim; and slowly he felt the girl's supineness leaving her; and now she\nrecovers herself a little,--and again he feels her faintly struggling in\nhis arms, as if somehow abashed, and incredulous of mortal right to hold\nher so. Now Pierre repents his over-ardent and incautious warmth, and\nfeels himself all reverence for her. Tenderly he leads her to a bench\nwithin the double casement; and sits beside her; and waits in silence,\ntill the first shock of this encounter shall have left her more composed\nand more prepared to hold communion with him.\n\n\"How feel'st thou now, my sister?\"\n\n\"Bless thee! bless thee!\"\n\nAgain the sweet, wild power of the musicalness of the voice, and some\nsoft, strange touch of foreignness in the accent,--so it fancifully\nseemed to Pierre, thrills through and through his soul. He bent and\nkissed her brow; and then feels her hand seeking his, and then clasping\nit without one uttered word.\n\nAll his being is now condensed in that one sensation of the clasping\nhand. He feels it as very small and smooth, but strangely hard. Then he\nknew that by the lonely labor of her hands, his own father's daughter\nhad earned her living in the same world, where he himself, her own\nbrother, had so idly dwelled. Once more he reverently kissed her brow,\nand his warm breath against it murmured with a prayer to heaven.\n\n\"I have no tongue to speak to thee, Pierre, my brother. My whole being,\nall my life's thoughts and longings are in endless arrears to thee; then\nhow can I speak to thee? Were it God's will, Pierre, my utmost blessing\nnow, were to lie down and die. Then should I be at peace. Bear with me,\nPierre.\"\n\n\"Eternally will I do that, my beloved Isabel! Speak not to me yet\nawhile, if that seemeth best to thee, if that only is possible to thee.\nThis thy clasping hand, my sister, _this_ is now thy tongue to me.\"\n\n\"I know not where to begin to speak to thee, Pierre; and yet my soul\no'erbrims in me.\"\n\n\"From my heart's depths, I love and reverence thee; and feel for thee,\nbackward and forward, through all eternity!\"\n\n\"Oh, Pierre, can'st thou not cure in me this dreaminess, this\nbewilderingness I feel? My poor head swims and swims, and will not\npause. My life can not last long thus; I am too full without discharge.\nConjure tears for me, Pierre; that my heart may not break with the\npresent feeling,--more death-like to me than all my grief gone by!\"\n\n\"Ye thirst-slaking evening skies, ye hilly dews and mists, distil your\nmoisture here! The bolt hath passed; why comes not the following\nshower?--Make her to weep!\"\n\nThen her head sought his support; and big drops fell on him; and anon,\nIsabel gently slid her head from him, and sat a little composedly beside\nhim.\n\n\"If thou feelest in endless arrears of thought to me, my sister; so do I\nfeel toward thee. I too, scarce know what I should speak to thee. But\nwhen thou lookest on me, my sister, thou beholdest one, who in his soul\nhath taken vows immutable, to be to thee, in all respects, and to the\nuttermost bounds and possibilities of Fate, thy protecting and\nall-acknowledging brother!\"\n\n\"Not mere sounds of common words, but inmost tones of my heart's deepest\nmelodies should now be audible to thee. Thou speakest to a human thing,\nbut something heavenly should answer thee;--some flute heard in the air\nshould answer thee; for sure thy most undreamed-of accents, Pierre, sure\nthey have not been unheard on high. Blessings that are imageless to all\nmortal fancyings, these shall be thine for this.\"\n\n\"Blessing like to thine, doth but recoil and bless homeward to the heart\nthat uttered it. I can not bless thee, my sister, as thou dost bless\nthyself in blessing my unworthiness. But, Isabel, by still keeping\npresent the first wonder of our meeting, we shall make our hearts all\nfeebleness. Let me then rehearse to thee what Pierre is; what life\nhitherto he hath been leading; and what hereafter he shall lead;--so\nthou wilt be prepared.\"\n\n\"Nay, Pierre, that is my office; thou art first entitled to my tale,\nthen, if it suit thee, thou shalt make me the unentitled gift of thine.\nListen to me, now. The invisible things will give me strength;--it is\nnot much, Pierre;--nor aught very marvelous. Listen then;--I feel\nsoothed down to utterance now.\"\n\nDuring some brief, interluding, silent pauses in their interview thus\nfar, Pierre had heard a soft, slow, sad, to-and-fro, meditative stepping\non the floor above; and in the frequent pauses that intermitted the\nstrange story in the following chapter, that same soft, slow, sad,\nto-and-fro, meditative, and most melancholy stepping, was again and\nagain audible in the silent room.\n\n\nIII.\n\n\"I never knew a mortal mother. The farthest stretch of my life's memory\ncan not recall one single feature of such a face. If, indeed, mother of\nmine hath lived, she is long gone, and cast no shadow on the ground she\ntrod. Pierre, the lips that do now speak to thee, never touched a\nwoman's breast; I seem not of woman born. My first dim life-thoughts\ncluster round an old, half-ruinous house in some region, for which I now\nhave no chart to seek it out. If such a spot did ever really exist, that\ntoo seems to have been withdrawn from all the remainder of the earth. It\nwas a wild, dark house, planted in the midst of a round, cleared,\ndeeply-sloping space, scooped out of the middle of deep stunted pine\nwoods. Ever I shrunk at evening from peeping out of my window, lest the\nghostly pines should steal near to me, and reach out their grim arms to\nsnatch me into their horrid shadows. In summer the forest unceasingly\nhummed with unconjecturable voices of unknown birds and beasts. In\nwinter its deep snows were traced like any paper map, with dotting\nnight-tracks of four-footed creatures, that, even to the sun, were never\nvisible, and never were seen by man at all. In the round open space the\ndark house stood, without one single green twig or leaf to shelter it;\nshadeless and shelterless in the heart of shade and shelter. Some of the\nwindows were rudely boarded up, with boards nailed straight up and down;\nand those rooms were utterly empty, and never were entered, though they\nwere doorless. But often, from the echoing corridor, I gazed into them\nwith fear; for the great fire-places were all in ruins; the lower tier\nof back-stones were burnt into one white, common crumbling; and the\nblack bricks above had fallen upon the hearths, heaped here and there\nwith the still falling soot of long-extinguished fires. Every\nhearth-stone in that house had one long crack through it; every floor\ndrooped at the corners; and outside, the whole base of the house, where\nit rested on the low foundation of greenish stones, was strewn with\ndull, yellow molderings of the rotting sills. No name; no scrawled or\nwritten thing; no book, was in the house; no one memorial speaking of\nits former occupants. It was dumb as death. No grave-stone, or mound, or\nany little hillock around the house, betrayed any past burials of man or\nchild. And thus, with no trace then to me of its past history, thus it\nhath now entirely departed and perished from my slightest knowledge as\nto where that house so stood, or in what region it so stood. None other\nhouse like it have I ever seen. But once I saw plates of the outside of\nFrench chateaux which powerfully recalled its dim image to me,\nespecially the two rows of small dormer windows projecting from the\ninverted hopper-roof. But that house was of wood, and these of stone.\nStill, sometimes I think that house was not in this country, but\nsomewhere in Europe; perhaps in France; but it is all bewildering to me;\nand so you must not start at me, for I can not but talk wildly upon so\nwild a theme.\n\n\"In this house I never saw any living human soul, but an old man and\nwoman. The old man's face was almost black with age, and was one purse\nof wrinkles, his hoary beard always tangled, streaked with dust and\nearthy crumbs. I think in summer he toiled a little in the garden, or\nsome spot like that, which lay on one side of the house. All my ideas\nare in uncertainty and confusion here. But the old man and the old woman\nseem to have fastened themselves indelibly upon my memory. I suppose\ntheir being the only human things around me then, _that_ caused the hold\nthey took upon me. They seldom spoke to me; but would sometimes, of\ndark, gusty nights, sit by the fire and stare at me, and then mumble to\neach other, and then stare at me again. They were not entirely unkind to\nme; but, I repeat, they seldom or never spoke to me. What words or\nlanguage they used to each other, this it is impossible for me to\nrecall. I have often wished to; for then I might at least have some\nadditional idea whether the house was in this country or somewhere\nbeyond the sea. And here I ought to say, that sometimes I have, I know\nnot what sort of vague remembrances of at one time--shortly after the\nperiod I now speak of--chattering in two different childish languages;\none of which waned in me as the other and latter grew. But more of this\nanon. It was the woman that gave me my meals; for I did not eat with\nthem. Once they sat by the fire with a loaf between them, and a bottle\nof some thin sort of reddish wine; and I went up to them, and asked to\neat with them, and touched the loaf. But instantly the old man made a\nmotion as if to strike me, but did not, and the woman, glaring at me,\nsnatched the loaf and threw it into the fire before them. I ran\nfrightened from the room; and sought a cat, which I had often tried to\ncoax into some intimacy, but, for some strange cause, without success.\nBut in my frightened loneliness, then, I sought the cat again, and found\nher up-stairs, softly scratching for some hidden thing among the litter\nof the abandoned fire-places. I called to her, for I dared not go into\nthe haunted chamber; but she only gazed sideways and unintelligently\ntoward me; and continued her noiseless searchings. I called again, and\nthen she turned round and hissed at me; and I ran down stairs, still\nstung with the thought of having been driven away there, too. I now knew\nnot where to go to rid myself of my loneliness. At last I went outside\nof the house, and sat down on a stone, but its coldness went up to my\nheart, and I rose and stood on my feet. But my head was dizzy; I could\nnot stand; I fell, and knew no more. But next morning I found myself in\nbed in my uncheerable room, and some dark bread and a cup of water by\nme.\n\n\"It has only been by chance that I have told thee this one particular\nreminiscence of my early life in that house. I could tell many more like\nit, but this is enough to show what manner of life I led at that time.\nEvery day that I then lived, I felt all visible sights and all audible\nsounds growing stranger and stranger, and fearful and more fearful to\nme. To me the man and the woman were just like the cat; none of them\nwould speak to me; none of them were comprehensible to me. And the man,\nand the woman, and the cat, were just like the green foundation stones\nof the house to me; I knew not whence they came, or what cause they had\nfor being there. I say again, no living human soul came to the house but\nthe man and the woman; but sometimes the old man early trudged away to a\nroad that led through the woods, and would not come back till late in\nthe evening; he brought the dark bread, and the thin, reddish wine with\nhim. Though the entrance to the wood was not so very far from the door,\nyet he came so slowly and infirmly trudging with his little load, that\nit seemed weary hours on hours between my first descrying him among the\ntrees, and his crossing the splintered threshold.\n\n\"Now the wide and vacant blurrings of my early life thicken in my mind.\nAll goes wholly memoryless to me now. It may have been that about that\ntime I grew sick with some fever, in which for a long interval I lost\nmyself. Or it may be true, which I have heard, that after the period of\nour very earliest recollections, then a space intervenes of entire\nunknowingness, followed again by the first dim glimpses of the\nsucceeding memory, more or less distinctly embracing all our past up to\nthat one early gap in it.\n\n\"However this may be, nothing more can I recall of the house in the wide\nopen space; nothing of how at last I came to leave it; but I must have\nbeen still extremely young then. But some uncertain, tossing memory have\nI of being at last in another round, open space, but immensely larger\nthan the first one, and with no encircling belt of woods. Yet often it\nseems to me that there were three tall, straight things like pine-trees\nsomewhere there nigh to me at times; and that they fearfully shook and\nsnapt as the old trees used to in the mountain storms. And the floors\nseemed sometimes to droop at the corners still more steeply than the old\nfloors did; and changefully drooped too, so that I would even seem to\nfeel them drooping under me.\n\n\"Now, too, it was that, as it sometimes seems to me, I first and last\nchattered in the two childish languages I spoke of a little time ago.\nThere seemed people about me, some of whom talked one, and some the\nother; but I talked both; yet one not so readily as the other; and but\nbeginningly as it were; still this other was the one which was gradually\ndisplacing the former. The men who--as it sometimes dreamily seems to me\nat times--often climbed the three strange tree-like things, they\ntalked--I needs must think--if indeed I have any real thought about so\nbodiless a phantom as this is--they talked the language which I speak of\nas at this time gradually waning in me. It was a bonny tongue; oh, seems\nto me so sparkling-gay and lightsome; just the tongue for a child like\nme, if the child had not been so sad always. It was pure children's\nlanguage, Pierre; so twittering--such a chirp.\n\n\"In thy own mind, thou must now perceive, that most of these dim\nremembrances in me, hint vaguely of a ship at sea. But all is dim and\nvague to me. Scarce know I at any time whether I tell you real things,\nor the unrealest dreams. Always in me, the solidest things melt into\ndreams, and dreams into solidities. Never have I wholly recovered from\nthe effects of my strange early life. This it is, that even now--this\nmoment--surrounds thy visible form, my brother, with a mysterious\nmistiness; so that a second face, and a third face, and a fourth face\npeep at me from within thy own. Now dim, and more dim, grows in me all\nthe memory of how thou and I did come to meet. I go groping again amid\nall sorts of shapes, which part to me; so that I seem to advance through\nthe shapes; and yet the shapes have eyes that look at me. I turn round,\nand they look at me; I step forward, and they look at me.--Let me be\nsilent now; do not speak to me.\"\n\n\nIV.\n\nFilled with nameless wonderings at this strange being, Pierre sat mute,\nintensely regarding her half-averted aspect. Her immense soft tresses of\nthe jettiest hair had slantingly fallen over her as though a curtain\nwere half drawn from before some saint enshrined. To Pierre, she seemed\nhalf unearthly; but this unearthliness was only her mysteriousness, not\nany thing that was repelling or menacing to him. And still, the low\nmelodies of her far interior voice hovered in sweet echoes in the room;\nand were trodden upon, and pressed like gushing grapes, by the steady\ninvisible pacing on the floor above.\n\nShe moved a little now, and after some strange wanderings more\ncoherently continued.\n\n\"My next memory which I think I can in some degree rely upon, was yet\nanother house, also situated away from human haunts, in the heart of a\nnot entirely silent country. Through this country, and by the house,\nwound a green and lagging river. That house must have been in some\nlowland; for the first house I spoke of seems to me to have been\nsomewhere among mountains, or near to mountains;--the sounds of the far\nwaterfalls,--I seem to hear them now; the steady up-pointed cloud-shapes\nbehind the house in the sunset sky--I seem to see them now. But this\nother house, this second one, or third one, I know not which, I say\nagain it was in some lowland. There were no pines around it; few trees\nof any sort; the ground did not slope so steeply as around the first\nhouse. There were cultivated fields about it, and in the distance\nfarm-houses, and out-houses, and cattle, and fowls, and many objects of\nthat familiar sort. This house I am persuaded was in this country; on\nthis side of the sea. It was a very large house, and full of people; but\nfor the most part they lived separately. There were some old people in\nit, and there were young men, and young women in it,--some very\nhandsome; and there were children in it. It seemed a happy place to some\nof these people; many of them were always laughing; but it was not a\nhappy place for me.\n\n\"But here I may err, because of my own consciousness I can not identify\nin myself--I mean in the memory of my whole foregoing life,--I say, I\ncan not identify that thing which is called happiness; that thing whose\ntoken is a laugh, or a smile, or a silent serenity on the lip. I may\nhave been happy, but it is not in my conscious memory now. Nor do I feel\na longing for it, as though I had never had it; my spirit seeks\ndifferent food from happiness; for I think I have a suspicion of what it\nis. I have suffered wretchedness, but not because of the absence of\nhappiness, and without praying for happiness. I pray for peace--for\nmotionlessness--for the feeling of myself, as of some plant, absorbing\nlife without seeking it, and existing without individual sensation. I\nfeel that there can be no perfect peace in individualness. Therefore I\nhope one day to feel myself drank up into the pervading spirit animating\nall things. I feel I am an exile here. I still go straying.--Yes; in thy\nspeech, thou smilest.--But let me be silent again. Do not answer me.\nWhen I resume, I will not wander so, but make short end.\"\n\nReverently resolved not to offer the slightest let or hinting hindrance\nto the singular tale rehearsing to him, but to sit passively and receive\nits marvelous droppings into his soul, however long the pauses; and as\ntouching less mystical considerations, persuaded that by so doing he\nshould ultimately derive the least nebulous and imperfect account of\nIsabel's history; Pierre still sat waiting her resuming, his eyes fixed\nupon the girl's wonderfully beautiful ear, which chancing to peep forth\nfrom among her abundant tresses, nestled in that blackness like a\ntransparent sea-shell of pearl.\n\nShe moved a little now; and after some strange wanderings more\ncoherently continued; while the sound of the stepping on the floor\nabove--it seemed to cease.\n\n\"I have spoken of the second or rather the third spot in my memory of\nthe past, as it first appeared to me; I mean, I have spoken of the\npeople in the house, according to my very earliest recallable impression\nof them. But I stayed in that house for several years--five, six,\nperhaps, seven years--and during that interval of my stay, all things\nchanged to me, because I learned more, though always dimly. Some of its\noccupants departed; some changed from smiles to tears; some went moping\nall the day; some grew as savages and outrageous, and were dragged\nbelow by dumb-like men into deep places, that I knew nothing of, but\ndismal sounds came through the lower floor, groans and clanking\nfallings, as of iron in straw. Now and then, I saw coffins silently at\nnoon-day carried into the house, and in five minutes' time emerge again,\nseemingly heavier than they entered; but I saw not who was in them.\nOnce, I saw an immense-sized coffin, endwise pushed through a lower\nwindow by three men who did not speak; and watching, I saw it pushed out\nagain, and they drove off with it. But the numbers of those invisible\npersons who thus departed from the house, were made good by other\ninvisible persons arriving in close carriages. Some in rags and tatters\ncame on foot, or rather were driven on foot. Once I heard horrible\noutcries, and peeping from my window, saw a robust but squalid and\ndistorted man, seemingly a peasant, tied by cords with four long ends to\nthem, held behind by as many ignorant-looking men who with a lash drove\nthe wild squalid being that way toward the house. Then I heard answering\nhand-clappings, shrieks, howls, laughter, blessings, prayers, oaths,\nhymns, and all audible confusions issuing from all the chambers of the\nhouse.\n\n\"Sometimes there entered the house--though only transiently, departing\nwithin the hour they came--people of a then remarkable aspect to me.\nThey were very composed of countenance; did not laugh; did not groan;\ndid not weep; did not make strange faces; did not look endlessly\nfatigued; were not strangely and fantastically dressed; in short, did\nnot at all resemble any people I had ever seen before, except a little\nlike some few of the persons of the house, who seemed to have authority\nover the rest. These people of a remarkable aspect to me, I thought they\nwere strangely demented people;--composed of countenance, but wandering\nof mind; soul-composed and bodily-wandering, and strangely demented\npeople.\n\n\"By-and-by, the house seemed to change again, or else my mind took in\nmore, and modified its first impressions. I was lodged up-stairs in a\nlittle room; there was hardly any furniture in the room; sometimes I\nwished to go out of it; but the door was locked. Sometimes the people\ncame and took me out of the room, into a much larger and very long room,\nand here I would collectively see many of the other people of the house,\nwho seemed likewise brought from distant and separate chambers. In this\nlong room they would vacantly roam about, and talk vacant talk to each\nother. Some would stand in the middle of the room gazing steadily on the\nfloor for hours together, and never stirred, but only breathed and gazed\nupon the floor. Some would sit crouching in the corner, and sit\ncrouching there, and only breathe and crouch in the corners. Some kept\ntheir hands tight on their hearts, and went slowly promenading up and\ndown, moaning and moaning to themselves. One would say to another--\"Feel\nof it--here, put thy hand in the break.\" Another would mutter--\"Broken,\nbroken, broken\"--and would mutter nothing but that one word broken. But\nmost of them were dumb, and could not, or would not speak, or had\nforgotten how to speak. They were nearly all pale people. Some had hair\nwhite as snow, and yet were quite young people. Some were always talking\nabout Hell, Eternity, and God; and some of all things as fixedly\ndecreed; others would say nay to this, and then they would argue, but\nwithout much conviction either way. But once nearly all the people\npresent--even the dumb moping people, and the sluggish persons crouching\nin the corners--nearly all of them laughed once, when after a whole\nday's loud babbling, two of these predestinarian opponents, said each to\nthe other--'Thou hast convinced me, friend; but we are quits; for so\nalso, have I convinced thee, the other way; now then, let's argue it all\nover again; for still, though mutually converted, we are still at odds.'\nSome harangued the wall; some apostrophized the air; some hissed at the\nair; some lolled their tongues out at the air; some struck the air; some\nmade motions, as if wrestling with the air, and fell out of the arms of\nthe air, panting from the invisible hug.\n\n\"Now, as in the former thing, thou must, ere this, have suspected what\nmanner of place this second or third house was, that I then lived in.\nBut do not speak the word to me. That word has never passed my lips;\neven now, when I hear the word, I run from it; when I see it printed in\na book, I run from the book. The word is wholly unendurable to me. Who\nbrought me to the house; how I came there, I do not know. I lived a long\ntime in the house; that alone I know; I say I know, but still I am\nuncertain; still Pierre, still the--oh the dreaminess, the\nbewilderingness--it never entirely leaves me. Let me be still again.\"\n\nShe leaned away from him; she put her small hard hand to her forehead;\nthen moved it down, very slowly, but still hardly over her eyes, and\nkept it there, making no other sign, and still as death. Then she moved\nand continued her vague tale of terribleness.\n\n\"I must be shorter; I did not mean to turn off into the mere\noffshootings of my story, here and there; but the dreaminess I speak of\nleads me sometimes; and I, as impotent then, obey the dreamy prompting.\nBear with me; now I will be briefer.\"\n\n\"It came to pass, at last, that there was a contention about me in the\nhouse; some contention which I heard in the after rumor only, not at the\nactual time. Some strangers had arrived; or had come in haste, being\nsent for to the house. Next day they dressed me in new and pretty, but\nstill plain clothes, and they took me down stairs, and out into the air,\nand into a carriage with a pleasant-looking woman, a stranger to me; and\nI was driven off a good way, two days nearly we drove away, stopping\nsomewhere over-night; and on the evening of the second day we came to\nanother house, and went into it, and stayed there.\n\n\"This house was a much smaller one than the other, and seemed sweetly\nquiet to me after that. There was a beautiful infant in it; and this\nbeautiful infant always archly and innocently smiling on me, and\nstrangely beckoning me to come and play with it, and be glad with it;\nand be thoughtless, and be glad and gleeful with it; this beautiful\ninfant first brought me to my own mind, as it were; first made me\nsensible that I was something different from stones, trees, cats; first\nundid in me the fancy that all people were as stones, trees, cats; first\nfilled me with the sweet idea of humanness; first made me aware of the\ninfinite mercifulness, and tenderness, and beautifulness of humanness;\nand this beautiful infant first filled me with the dim thought of\nBeauty; and equally, and at the same time, with the feeling of the\nSadness; of the immortalness and universalness of the Sadness. I now\nfeel that I should soon have gone,---- stop me now; do not let me go\nthat way. I owe all things to that beautiful infant. Oh, how I envied\nit, lying in its happy mother's breast, and drawing life and gladness,\nand all its perpetual smilingness from that white and smiling breast.\nThat infant saved me; but still gave me vague desirings. Now I first\nbegan to reflect in my mind; to endeavor after the recalling past\nthings; but try as I would, little could I recall, but the\nbewilderingness;--and the stupor, and the torpor, and the blackness, and\nthe dimness, and the vacant whirlingness of the bewilderingness. Let me\nbe still again.\"\n\nAnd the stepping on the floor above,--it then resumed.\n\n\nV.\n\n\"I must have been nine, or ten, or eleven years old, when the\npleasant-looking woman carried me away from the large house. She was a\nfarmer's wife; and now that was my residence, the farm-house. They\ntaught me to sew, and work with wool, and spin the wool; I was nearly\nalways busy now. This being busy, too, this it must have been, which\npartly brought to me the power of being sensible of myself as something\nhuman. Now I began to feel strange differences. When I saw a snake\ntrailing through the grass, and darting out the fire-fork from its\nmouth, I said to myself, That thing is not human, but I am human. When\nthe lightning flashed, and split some beautiful tree, and left it to rot\nfrom all its greenness, I said, That lightning is not human, but I am\nhuman. And so with all other things. I can not speak coherently here;\nbut somehow I felt that all good, harmless men and women were human\nthings, placed at cross-purposes, in a world of snakes and lightnings,\nin a world of horrible and inscrutable inhumanities. I have had no\ntraining of any sort. All my thoughts well up in me; I know not whether\nthey pertain to the old bewilderings or not; but as they are, they are,\nand I can not alter them, for I had nothing to do with putting them in\nmy mind, and I never affect any thoughts, and I never adulterate any\nthoughts; but when I speak, think forth from the tongue, speech being\nsometimes before the thought; so, often, my own tongue teaches me new\nthings.\n\n\"Now as yet I never had questioned the woman, or her husband, or the\nyoung girls, their children, why I had been brought to the house, or how\nlong I was to stay in the house. There I was; just as I found myself in\nthe world; there I was; for what cause I had been brought into the\nworld, would have been no stranger question to me, than for what cause I\nhad been brought to the house. I knew nothing of myself, or any thing\npertaining to myself; I felt my pulse, my thought; but other things I\nwas ignorant of, except the general feeling of my humanness among the\ninhumanities. But as I grew older, I expanded in my mind. I began to\nlearn things out of me; to see still stranger, and minuter differences.\nI called the woman mother, and so did the other girls; yet the woman\noften kissed them, but seldom me. She always helped them first at table.\nThe farmer scarcely ever spoke to me. Now months, years rolled on, and\nthe young girls began to stare at me. Then the bewilderingness of the\nold starings of the solitary old man and old woman, by the cracked\nhearth-stone of the desolate old house, in the desolate, round, open\nspace; the bewilderingness of those old starings now returned to me; and\nthe green starings, and the serpent hissings of the uncompanionable cat,\nrecurred to me, and the feeling of the infinite forlornness of my life\nrolled over me. But the woman was very kind to me; she taught the girls\nnot to be cruel to me; she would call me to her, and speak cheerfully to\nme, and I thanked--not God, for I had been taught no God--I thanked the\nbright human summer, and the joyful human sun in the sky; I thanked the\nhuman summer and the sun, that they had given me the woman; and I would\nsometimes steal away into the beautiful grass, and worship the kind\nsummer and the sun; and often say over to myself the soft words, summer\nand the sun.\n\n\"Still, weeks and years ran on, and my hair began to vail me with its\nfullness and its length; and now often I heard the word beautiful,\nspoken of my hair, and beautiful, spoken of myself. They would not say\nthe word openly to me, but I would by chance overhear them whispering\nit. The word joyed me with the human feeling of it. They were wrong not\nto say it openly to me; my joy would have been so much the more assured\nfor the openness of their saying beautiful, to me; and I know it would\nhave filled me with all conceivable kindness toward every one. Now I\nhad heard the word beautiful, whispered, now and then, for some months,\nwhen a new being came to the house; they called him gentleman. His face\nwas wonderful to me. Something strangely like it, and yet again unlike\nit, I had seen before, but where, I could not tell. But one day, looking\ninto the smooth water behind the house, there I saw the\nlikeness--something strangely like, and yet unlike, the likeness of his\nface. This filled me with puzzlings. The new being, the gentleman, he\nwas very gracious to me; he seemed astonished, confounded at me; he\nlooked at me, then at a very little, round picture--so it seemed--which\nhe took from his pocket, and yet concealed from me. Then he kissed me,\nand looked with tenderness and grief upon me; and I felt a tear fall on\nme from him. Then he whispered a word into my ear. 'Father,' was the\nword he whispered; the same word by which the young girls called the\nfarmer. Then I knew it was the word of kindness and of kisses. I kissed\nthe gentleman.\n\n\"When he left the house I wept for him to come again. And he did come\nagain. All called him my father now. He came to see me once every month\nor two; till at last he came not at all; and when I wept and asked for\nhim, they said the word _Dead_ to me. Then the bewilderings of the\ncomings and the goings of the coffins at the large and populous house;\nthese bewilderings came over me. What was it to be dead? What is it to\nbe living? Wherein is the difference between the words Death and Life?\nHad I been ever dead? Was I living? Let me be still again. Do not speak\nto me.\"\n\nAnd the stepping on the floor above; again it did resume.\n\n\"Months ran on; and now I somehow learned that my father had every now\nand then sent money to the woman to keep me with her in the house; and\nthat no more money had come to her after he was dead; the last penny of\nthe former money was now gone. Now the farmer's wife looked troubledly\nand painfully at me; and the farmer looked unpleasantly and impatiently\nat me. I felt that something was miserably wrong; I said to myself, I am\none too many; I must go away from the pleasant house. Then the\nbewilderings of all the loneliness and forlornness of all my forlorn and\nlonely life; all these bewilderings and the whelmings of the\nbewilderings rolled over me; and I sat down without the house, but could\nnot weep.\n\n\"But I was strong, and I was a grown girl now. I said to the woman--Keep\nme hard at work; let me work all the time, but let me stay with thee.\nBut the other girls were sufficient to do the work; me they wanted not.\nThe farmer looked out of his eyes at me, and the out-lookings of his\neyes said plainly to me--Thee we do not want; go from us; thou art one\ntoo many; and thou art more than one too many. Then I said to the\nwoman--Hire me out to some one; let me work for some one.--But I spread\ntoo wide my little story. I must make an end.\n\n\"The woman listened to me, and through her means I went to live at\nanother house, and earned wages there. My work was milking the cows, and\nmaking butter, and spinning wool, and weaving carpets of thin strips of\ncloth. One day there came to this house a pedler. In his wagon he had a\nguitar, an old guitar, yet a very pretty one, but with broken strings.\nHe had got it slyly in part exchange from the servants of a grand house\nsome distance off. Spite of the broken strings, the thing looked very\ngraceful and beautiful to me; and I knew there was melodiousness lurking\nin the thing, though I had never seen a guitar before, nor heard of one;\nbut there was a strange humming in my heart that seemed to prophesy of\nthe hummings of the guitar. Intuitively, I knew that the strings were\nnot as they should be. I said to the man--I will buy of thee the thing\nthou callest a guitar. But thou must put new strings to it. So he went\nto search for them; and brought the strings, and restringing the guitar,\ntuned it for me. So with part of my earnings I bought the guitar.\nStraightway I took it to my little chamber in the gable, and softly laid\nit on my bed. Then I murmured; sung and murmured to it; very lowly, very\nsoftly; I could hardly hear myself. And I changed the modulations of my\nsingings and my murmurings; and still sung, and murmured, lowly,\nsoftly,--more and more; and presently I heard a sudden sound: sweet and\nlow beyond all telling was the sweet and sudden sound. I clapt my hands;\nthe guitar was speaking to me; the dear guitar was singing to me;\nmurmuring and singing to me, the guitar. Then I sung and murmured to it\nwith a still different modulation; and once more it answered me from a\ndifferent string; and once more it murmured to me, and it answered to me\nwith a different string. The guitar was human; the guitar taught me the\nsecret of the guitar; the guitar learned me to play on the guitar. No\nmusic-master have I ever had but the guitar. I made a loving friend of\nit; a heart friend of it. It sings to me as I to it. Love is not all on\none side with my guitar. All the wonders that are unimaginable and\nunspeakable; all these wonders are translated in the mysterious\nmelodiousness of the guitar. It knows all my past history. Sometimes it\nplays to me the mystic visions of the confused large house I never name.\nSometimes it brings to me the bird-twitterings in the air; and sometimes\nit strikes up in me rapturous pulsations of legendary delights eternally\nunexperienced and unknown to me. Bring me the guitar.\"\n\n\nVI.\n\nEntranced, lost, as one wandering bedazzled and amazed among innumerable\ndancing lights, Pierre had motionlessly listened to this\nabundant-haired, and large-eyed girl of mystery.\n\n\"Bring me the guitar!\"\n\nStarting from his enchantment, Pierre gazed round the room, and saw the\ninstrument leaning against a corner. Silently he brought it to the girl,\nand silently sat down again.\n\n\"Now listen to the guitar; and the guitar shall sing to thee the sequel\nof my story; for not in words can it be spoken. So listen to the\nguitar.\"\n\nInstantly the room was populous with sounds of melodiousness, and\nmournfulness, and wonderfulness; the room swarmed with the\nunintelligible but delicious sounds. The sounds seemed waltzing in the\nroom; the sounds hung pendulous like glittering icicles from the corners\nof the room; and fell upon him with a ringing silveryness; and were\ndrawn up again to the ceiling, and hung pendulous again, and dropt down\nupon him again with the ringing silveryness. Fire-flies seemed buzzing\nin the sounds; summer-lightnings seemed vividly yet softly audible in\nthe sounds.\n\nAnd still the wild girl played on the guitar; and her long dark shower\nof curls fell over it, and vailed it; and still, out from the vail came\nthe swarming sweetness, and the utter unintelligibleness, but the\ninfinite significancies of the sounds of the guitar.\n\n\"Girl of all-bewildering mystery!\" cried Pierre--\"Speak to me;--sister,\nif thou indeed canst be a thing that's mortal--speak to me, if thou be\nIsabel!\"\n\n    \"Mystery! Mystery!\n     Mystery of Isabel!\n     Mystery! Mystery!\n     Isabel and Mystery!\"\n\nAmong the waltzings, and the droppings, and the swarmings of the sounds,\nPierre now heard the tones above deftly stealing and winding among the\nmyriad serpentinings of the other melody:--deftly stealing and winding\nas respected the instrumental sounds, but in themselves wonderfully and\nabandonedly free and bold--bounding and rebounding as from multitudinous\nreciprocal walls; while with every syllable the hair-shrouded form of\nIsabel swayed to and fro with a like abandonment, and suddenness, and\nwantonness:--then it seemed not like any song; seemed not issuing from\nany mouth; but it came forth from beneath the same vail concealing the\nguitar.\n\nNow a strange wild heat burned upon his brow; he put his hand to it.\nInstantly the music changed; and drooped and changed; and changed and\nchanged; and lingeringly retreated as it changed; and at last was wholly\ngone.\n\nPierre was the first to break the silence.\n\n\"Isabel, thou hast filled me with such wonderings; I am so distraught\nwith thee, that the particular things I had to tell to thee, when I\nhither came; these things I can not now recall, to speak them to\nthee:--I feel that something is still unsaid by thee, which at some\nother time thou wilt reveal. But now I can stay no longer with thee.\nKnow me eternally as thy loving, revering, and most marveling brother,\nwho will never desert thee, Isabel. Now let me kiss thee and depart,\ntill to-morrow night; when I shall open to thee all my mind, and all my\nplans concerning me and thee. Let me kiss thee, and adieu!\"\n\nAs full of unquestioning and unfaltering faith in him, the girl sat\nmotionless and heard him out. Then silently rose, and turned her\nboundlessly confiding brow to him. He kissed it thrice, and without\nanother syllable left the place.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK VII.\n\nINTERMEDIATE BETWEEN PIERRE'S TWO INTERVIEWS WITH ISABEL AT THE\nFARM-HOUSE.\n\n\nI.\n\nNot immediately, not for a long time, could Pierre fully, or by any\napproximation, realize the scene which he had just departed. But the\nvague revelation was now in him, that the visible world, some of which\nbefore had seemed but too common and prosaic to him; and but too\nintelligible; he now vaguely felt, that all the world, and every\nmisconceivedly common and prosaic thing in it, was steeped a million\nfathoms in a mysteriousness wholly hopeless of solution. First, the\nenigmatical story of the girl, and the profound sincerity of it, and yet\nthe ever accompanying haziness, obscurity, and almost miraculousness of\nit;--first, this wonderful story of the girl had displaced all\ncommonness and prosaicness from his soul; and then, the inexplicable\nspell of the guitar, and the subtleness of the melodious appealings of\nthe few brief words from Isabel sung in the conclusion of the\nmelody--all this had bewitched him, and enchanted him, till he had sat\nmotionless and bending over, as a tree-transformed and mystery-laden\nvisitant, caught and fast bound in some necromancer's garden.\n\nBut as now burst from these sorceries, he hurried along the open road,\nhe strove for the time to dispel the mystic feeling, or at least\npostpone it for a while, until he should have time to rally both body\nand soul from the more immediate consequences of that day's long\nfastings and wanderings, and that night's never-to-be-forgotten scene.\nHe now endeavored to beat away all thoughts from him, but of present\nbodily needs.\n\nPassing through the silent village, he heard the clock tell the mid hour\nof night. Hurrying on, he entered the mansion by a private door, the key\nof which hung in a secret outer place. Without undressing, he flung\nhimself upon the bed. But remembering himself again, he rose and\nadjusted his alarm-clock, so that it would emphatically repeat the hour\nof five. Then to bed again, and driving off all intrudings of\nthoughtfulness, and resolutely bending himself to slumber, he by-and-by\nfell into its at first reluctant, but at last welcoming and hospitable\narms. At five he rose; and in the east saw the first spears of the\nadvanced-guard of the day.\n\nIt had been his purpose to go forth at that early hour, and so avoid all\ncasual contact with any inmate of the mansion, and spend the entire day\nin a second wandering in the woods, as the only fit prelude to the\nsociety of so wild a being as his new-found sister Isabel. But the\nfamiliar home-sights of his chamber strangely worked upon him. For an\ninstant, he almost could have prayed Isabel back into the wonder-world\nfrom which she had so slidingly emerged. For an instant, the fond,\nall-understood blue eyes of Lucy displaced the as tender, but mournful\nand inscrutable dark glance of Isabel. He seemed placed between them, to\nchoose one or the other; then both seemed his; but into Lucy's eyes\nthere stole half of the mournfulness of Isabel's, without diminishing\nhers.\n\nAgain the faintness, and the long life-weariness benumbed him. He left\nthe mansion, and put his bare forehead against the restoring wind. He\nre-entered the mansion, and adjusted the clock to repeat emphatically\nthe call of seven; and then lay upon his bed. But now he could not\nsleep. At seven he changed his dress; and at half-past eight went below\nto meet his mother at the breakfast table, having a little before\noverheard her step upon the stair.\n\n\nII.\n\nHe saluted her; but she looked gravely and yet alarmedly, and then in a\nsudden, illy-repressed panic, upon him. Then he knew he must be\nwonderfully changed. But his mother spoke not to him, only to return his\ngood-morning. He saw that she was deeply offended with him, on many\naccounts; moreover, that she was vaguely frightened about him, and\nfinally that notwithstanding all this, her stung pride conquered all\napprehensiveness in her; and he knew his mother well enough to be very\ncertain that, though he should unroll a magician's parchment before her\nnow, she would verbally express no interest, and seek no explanation\nfrom him. Nevertheless, he could not entirely abstain from testing the\npower of her reservedness.\n\n\"I have been quite an absentee, sister Mary,\" said he, with ill-affected\npleasantness.\n\n\"Yes, Pierre. How does the coffee suit you this morning? It is some new\ncoffee.\"\n\n\"It is very nice; very rich and odorous, sister Mary.\"\n\n\"I am glad you find it so, Pierre.\"\n\n\"Why don't you call me brother Pierre?\"\n\n\"Have I not called you so? Well, then, brother Pierre,--is that better?\"\n\n\"Why do you look so indifferently and icily upon me, sister Mary?\"\n\n\"Do I look indifferently and icily? Then I will endeavor to look\notherwise. Give me the toast there, Pierre.\"\n\n\"You are very deeply offended at me, my dear mother.\"\n\n\"Not in the slightest degree, Pierre. Have you seen Lucy lately?\"\n\n\"I have not, my mother.\"\n\n\"Ah! A bit of salmon, Pierre.\"\n\n\"You are too proud to show toward me what you are this moment feeling,\nmy mother.\"\n\nMrs. Glendinning slowly rose to her feet, and her full stature of\nwomanly beauty and majesty stood imposingly over him.\n\n\"Tempt me no more, Pierre. I will ask no secret from thee; all shall be\nvoluntary between us, as it ever has been, until very lately, or all\nshall be nothing between us. Beware of me, Pierre. There lives not that\nbeing in the world of whom thou hast more reason to beware, so you\ncontinue but a little longer to act thus with me.\"\n\nShe reseated herself, and spoke no more. Pierre kept silence; and after\nsnatching a few mouthfuls of he knew not what, silently quitted the\ntable, and the room, and the mansion.\n\n\nIII.\n\nAs the door of the breakfast-room closed upon Pierre, Mrs. Glendinning\nrose, her fork unconsciously retained in her hand. Presently, as she\npaced the room in deep, rapid thought, she became conscious of something\nstrange in her grasp, and without looking at it, to mark what it was,\nimpulsively flung it from her. A dashing noise was heard, and then a\nquivering. She turned; and hanging by the side of Pierre's portrait, she\nsaw her own smiling picture pierced through, and the fork, whose silver\ntines had caught in the painted bosom, vibratingly rankled in the wound.\n\nShe advanced swiftly to the picture, and stood intrepidly before it.\n\n\"Yes, thou art stabbed! but the wrong hand stabbed thee; this should\nhave been _thy_ silver blow,\" turning to Pierre's portrait face.\n\"Pierre, Pierre, thou hast stabbed me with a poisoned point. I feel my\nblood chemically changing in me. I, the mother of the only surnamed\nGlendinning, I feel now as though I had borne the last of a swiftly to\nbe extinguished race. For swiftly to be extinguished is that race, whose\nonly heir but so much as impends upon a deed of shame. And some deed of\nshame, or something most dubious and most dark, is in thy soul, or else\nsome belying specter, with a cloudy, shame-faced front, sat at yon seat\nbut now! What can it be? Pierre, unbosom. Smile not so lightly upon my\nheavy grief. Answer; what is it, boy? Can it? can it?\nno--yes--surely--can it? it can not be! But he was not at Lucy's\nyesterday; nor was she here; and she would not see me when I called.\nWhat can this bode? But not a mere broken match--broken as lovers\nsometimes break, to mend the break with joyful tears, so soon again--not\na mere broken match can break my proud heart so. If that indeed be part,\nit is not all. But no, no, no; it can not, can not be. He would not,\ncould not, do so mad, so impious a thing. It was a most surprising face,\nthough I confessed it not to him, nor even hinted that I saw it. But no,\nno, no, it can not be. Such young peerlessness in such humbleness, can\nnot have an honest origin. Lilies are not stalked on weeds, though\npolluted, they sometimes may stand among them. She must be both poor and\nvile--some chance-blow of a splendid, worthless rake, doomed to inherit\nboth parts of her infecting portion--vileness and beauty. No, I will not\nthink it of him. But what then? Sometimes I have feared that my pride\nwould work me some woe incurable, by closing both my lips, and\nvarnishing all my front, where I perhaps ought to be wholly in the\nmelted and invoking mood. But who can get at one's own heart, to mend\nit? Right one's self against another, that, one may sometimes do; but\nwhen that other is one's own self, these ribs forbid. Then I will live\nmy nature out. I will stand on pride. I will not budge. Let come what\nwill, I shall not half-way run to meet it, to beat it off. Shall a\nmother abase herself before her stripling boy? Let him tell me of\nhimself, or let him slide adown!\"\n\n\nIV.\n\nPierre plunged deep into the woods, and paused not for several miles;\npaused not till he came to a remarkable stone, or rather, smoothed mass\nof rock, huge as a barn, which, wholly isolated horizontally, was yet\nsweepingly overarched by beech-trees and chestnuts.\n\nIt was shaped something like a lengthened egg, but flattened more; and,\nat the ends, pointed more; and yet not pointed, but irregularly\nwedge-shaped. Somewhere near the middle of its under side, there was a\nlateral ridge; and an obscure point of this ridge rested on a second\nlengthwise-sharpened rock, slightly protruding from the ground. Beside\nthat one obscure and minute point of contact, the whole enormous and\nmost ponderous mass touched not another object in the wide terraqueous\nworld. It was a breathless thing to see. One broad haunched end hovered\nwithin an inch of the soil, all along to the point of teetering contact;\nbut yet touched not the soil. Many feet from that--beneath one part of\nthe opposite end, which was all seamed and half-riven--the vacancy was\nconsiderably larger, so as to make it not only possible, but convenient\nto admit a crawling man; yet no mortal being had ever been known to have\nthe intrepid heart to crawl there.\n\nIt might well have been the wonder of all the country round. But strange\nto tell, though hundreds of cottage hearthstones--where, of long\nwinter-evenings, both old men smoked their pipes and young men shelled\ntheir corn--surrounded it, at no very remote distance, yet had the\nyouthful Pierre been the first known publishing discoverer of this\nstone, which he had thereupon fancifully christened the Memnon Stone.\nPossibly, the reason why this singular object had so long remained\nunblazoned to the world, was not so much because it had never before\nbeen lighted on--though indeed, both belted and topped by the dense deep\nluxuriance of the aboriginal forest, it lay like Captain Kidd's sunken\nhull in the gorge of the river Hudson's Highlands,--its crown being full\neight fathoms under high-foliage mark during the great spring-tide of\nfoliage;--and besides this, the cottagers had no special motive for\nvisiting its more immediate vicinity at all; their timber and fuel being\nobtained from more accessible woodlands--as because, even, if any of the\nsimple people should have chanced to have beheld it, they, in their\nhoodwinked unappreciativeness, would not have accounted it any very\nmarvelous sight, and therefore, would never have thought it worth their\nwhile to publish it abroad. So that in real truth, they might have seen\nit, and yet afterward have forgotten so inconsiderable a circumstance.\nIn short, this wondrous Memnon Stone could be no Memnon Stone to them;\nnothing but a huge stumbling-block, deeply to be regretted as a vast\nprospective obstacle in the way of running a handy little cross-road\nthrough that wild part of the Manor.\n\nNow one day while reclining near its flank, and intently eying it, and\nthinking how surprising it was, that in so long-settled a country he\nshould have been the first discerning and appreciative person to light\nupon such a great natural curiosity, Pierre happened to brush aside\nseveral successive layers of old, gray-haired, close cropped, nappy\nmoss, and beneath, to his no small amazement, he saw rudely hammered in\nthe rock some half-obliterate initials--\"S. ye W.\" Then he knew, that\nignorant of the stone, as all the simple country round might\nimmemorially have been, yet was not himself the only human being who had\ndiscovered that marvelous impending spectacle: but long and long ago, in\nquite another age, the stone had been beheld, and its wonderfulness\nfully appreciated--as the painstaking initials seemed to testify--by\nsome departed man, who, were he now alive, might possibly wag a beard\nold as the most venerable oak of centuries' growth. But who,--who in\nMethuselah's name,--who might have been this \"S. ye W?\" Pierre\npondered long, but could not possibly imagine; for the initials, in\ntheir antiqueness, seemed to point to some period before the era of\nColumbus' discovery of the hemisphere. Happening in the end to mention\nthe strange matter of these initials to a white-haired old gentleman,\nhis city kinsman, who, after a long and richly varied, but unfortunate\nlife, had at last found great solace in the Old Testament, which he was\ncontinually studying with ever-increasing admiration; this white-haired\nold kinsman, after having learnt all the particulars about the\nstone--its bulk, its height, the precise angle of its critical\nimpendings, and all that,--and then, after much prolonged cogitation\nupon it, and several long-drawn sighs, and aged looks of hoar\nsignificance, and reading certain verses in Ecclesiastes; after all\nthese tedious preliminaries, this not-at-all-to-be-hurried white-haired\nold kinsman, had laid his tremulous hand upon Pierre's firm young\nshoulder, and slowly whispered--\"Boy; 'tis Solomon the Wise.\" Pierre\ncould not repress a merry laugh at this; wonderfully diverted by what\nseemed to him so queer and crotchety a conceit; which he imputed to the\nalledged dotage of his venerable kinsman, who he well knew had once\nmaintained, that the old Scriptural Ophir was somewhere on our northern\nsea-coast; so no wonder the old gentleman should fancy that King Solomon\nmight have taken a trip--as a sort of amateur supercargo--of some Tyre\nor Sidon gold-ship across the water, and happened to light on the Memnon\nStone, while rambling about with bow and quiver shooting partridges.\n\nBut merriment was by no means Pierre's usual mood when thinking of this\nstone; much less when seated in the woods, he, in the profound\nsignificance of that deep forest silence, viewed its marvelous\nimpendings. A flitting conceit had often crossed him, that he would like\nnothing better for a head-stone than this same imposing pile; in which,\nat times, during the soft swayings of the surrounding foliage, there\nseemed to lurk some mournful and lamenting plaint, as for some sweet boy\nlong since departed in the antediluvian time.\n\nNot only might this stone well have been the wonder of the simple\ncountry round, but it might well have been its terror. Sometimes,\nwrought to a mystic mood by contemplating its ponderous inscrutableness,\nPierre had called it the Terror Stone. Few could be bribed to climb its\ngiddy height, and crawl out upon its more hovering end. It seemed as if\nthe dropping of one seed from the beak of the smallest flying bird would\ntopple the immense mass over, crashing against the trees.\n\nIt was a very familiar thing to Pierre; he had often climbed it, by\nplacing long poles against it, and so creeping up to where it sloped in\nlittle crumbling stepping-places; or by climbing high up the neighboring\nbeeches, and then lowering himself down upon the forehead-like summit by\nthe elastic branches. But never had he been fearless enough--or rather\nfool-hardy enough, it may be, to crawl on the ground beneath the vacancy\nof the higher end; that spot first menaced by the Terror Stone should it\never really topple.\n\n\nV.\n\nYet now advancing steadily, and as if by some interior\npre-determination, and eying the mass unfalteringly; he then threw\nhimself prone upon the wood's last year's leaves, and slid himself\nstraight into the horrible interspace, and lay there as dead. He spoke\nnot, for speechless thoughts were in him. These gave place at last to\nthings less and less unspeakable; till at last, from beneath the very\nbrow of the beetlings and the menacings of the Terror Stone came the\naudible words of Pierre:--\n\n\"If the miseries of the undisclosable things in me, shall ever unhorse\nme from my manhood's seat; if to vow myself all Virtue's and all\nTruth's, be but to make a trembling, distrusted slave of me; if Life is\nto prove a burden I can not bear without ignominious cringings; if\nindeed our actions are all fore-ordained, and we are Russian serfs to\nFate; if invisible devils do titter at us when we most nobly strive; if\nLife be a cheating dream, and virtue as unmeaning and unsequeled with\nany blessing as the midnight mirth of wine; if by sacrificing myself for\nDuty's sake, my own mother re-sacrifices me; if Duty's self be but a\nbugbear, and all things are allowable and unpunishable to man;--then do\nthou, Mute Massiveness, fall on me! Ages thou hast waited; and if these\nthings be thus, then wait no more; for whom better canst thou crush than\nhim who now lies here invoking thee?\"\n\nA down-darting bird, all song, swiftly lighted on the unmoved and\neternally immovable balancings of the Terror Stone, and cheerfully\nchirped to Pierre. The tree-boughs bent and waved to the rushes of a\nsudden, balmy wind; and slowly Pierre crawled forth, and stood haughtily\nupon his feet, as he owed thanks to none, and went his moody way.\n\n\nVI.\n\nWhen in his imaginative ruminating moods of early youth, Pierre had\nchristened the wonderful stone by the old resounding name of Memnon, he\nhad done so merely from certain associative remembrances of that\nEgyptian marvel, of which all Eastern travelers speak. And when the\nfugitive thought had long ago entered him of desiring that same stone\nfor his head-stone, when he should be no more; then he had only yielded\nto one of those innumerable fanciful notions, tinged with dreamy\npainless melancholy, which are frequently suggested to the mind of a\npoetic boy. But in after-times, when placed in far different\ncircumstances from those surrounding him at the Meadows, Pierre pondered\non the stone, and his young thoughts concerning it, and, later, his\ndesperate act in crawling under it; then an immense significance came to\nhim, and the long-passed unconscious movements of his then youthful\nheart seemed now prophetic to him, and allegorically verified by the\nsubsequent events.\n\nFor, not to speak of the other and subtler meanings which lie crouching\nbehind the colossal haunches of this stone, regarded as the menacingly\nimpending Terror Stone--hidden to all the simple cottagers, but revealed\nto Pierre--consider its aspects as the Memnon Stone. For Memnon was that\ndewey, royal boy, son of Aurora, and born King of Egypt, who, with\nenthusiastic rashness flinging himself on another's account into a\nrightful quarrel, fought hand to hand with his overmatch, and met his\nboyish and most dolorous death beneath the walls of Troy. His wailing\nsubjects built a monument in Egypt to commemorate his untimely fate.\nTouched by the breath of the bereaved Aurora, every sunrise that statue\ngave forth a mournful broken sound, as of a harp-string suddenly\nsundered, being too harshly wound.\n\nHerein lies an unsummed world of grief. For in this plaintive fable we\nfind embodied the Hamletism of the antique world; the Hamletism of three\nthousand years ago: \"The flower of virtue cropped by a too rare\nmischance.\" And the English Tragedy is but Egyptian Memnon, Montaignized\nand modernized; for being but a mortal man Shakspeare had his fathers\ntoo.\n\nNow as the Memnon Statue survives down to this present day, so does that\nnobly-striving but ever-shipwrecked character in some royal youths (for\nboth Memnon and Hamlet were the sons of kings), of which that statue is\nthe melancholy type. But Memnon's sculptured woes did once melodiously\nresound; now all is mute. Fit emblem that of old, poetry was a\nconsecration and an obsequy to all hapless modes of human life; but in a\nbantering, barren, and prosaic, heartless age, Aurora's music-moan is\nlost among our drifting sands which whelm alike the monument and the\ndirge.\n\n\nVII.\n\nAs Pierre went on through the woods, all thoughts now left him but those\ninvesting Isabel. He strove to condense her mysterious haze into some\ndefinite and comprehensible shape. He could not but infer that the\nfeeling of bewilderment, which she had so often hinted of during their\ninterview, had caused her continually to go aside from the straight line\nof her narration; and finally to end it in an abrupt and enigmatical\nobscurity. But he also felt assured, that as this was entirely\nunintended, and now, doubtless, regretted by herself, so their coming\nsecond interview would help to clear up much of this mysteriousness;\nconsidering that the elapsing interval would do much to tranquilize her,\nand rally her into less of wonderfulness to him; he did not therefore\nso much accuse his unthinkingness in naming the postponing hour he had.\nFor, indeed, looking from the morning down the vista of the day, it\nseemed as indefinite and interminable to him. He could not bring himself\nto confront any face or house; a plowed field, any sign of tillage, the\nrotted stump of a long-felled pine, the slightest passing trace of man\nwas uncongenial and repelling to him. Likewise in his own mind all\nremembrances and imaginings that had to do with the common and general\nhumanity had become, for the time, in the most singular manner\ndistasteful to him. Still, while thus loathing all that was common in\nthe two different worlds--that without, and that within--nevertheless,\neven in the most withdrawn and subtlest region of his own essential\nspirit, Pierre could not now find one single agreeable twig of thought\nwhereon to perch his weary soul.\n\nMen in general seldom suffer from this utter pauperism of the spirit. If\nGod hath not blessed them with incurable frivolity, men in general have\nstill some secret thing of self-conceit or virtuous gratulation; men in\ngeneral have always done some small self-sacrificing deed for some other\nman; and so, in those now and then recurring hours of despondent\nlassitude, which must at various and differing intervals overtake almost\nevery civilized human being; such persons straightway bethink them of\ntheir one, or two, or three small self-sacrificing things, and suck\nrespite, consolation, and more or less compensating deliciousness from\nit. But with men of self-disdainful spirits; in whose chosen souls\nheaven itself hath by a primitive persuasion unindoctrinally fixed that\nmost true Christian doctrine of the utter nothingness of good works; the\ncasual remembrance of their benevolent well-doings, does never distill\none drop of comfort for them, even as (in harmony with the correlative\nScripture doctrine) the recalling of their outlived errors and\nmis-deeds, conveys to them no slightest pang or shadow of reproach.\n\nThough the clew-defying mysteriousness of Isabel's narration, did now\nfor the time, in this particular mood of his, put on a repelling aspect\nto our Pierre; yet something must occupy the soul of man; and Isabel was\nnearest to him then; and Isabel he thought of; at first, with great\ndiscomfort and with pain, but anon (for heaven eventually rewards the\nresolute and duteous thinker) with lessening repugnance, and at last\nwith still-increasing willingness and congenialness. Now he recalled his\nfirst impressions, here and there, while she was rehearsing to him her\nwild tale; he recalled those swift but mystical corroborations in his\nown mind and memory, which by shedding another twinkling light upon her\nhistory, had but increased its mystery, while at the same time\nremarkably substantiating it.\n\nHer first recallable recollection was of an old deserted chateau-like\nhouse in a strange, French-like country, which she dimly imagined to be\nsomewhere beyond the sea. Did not this surprisingly correspond with\ncertain natural inferences to be drawn from his Aunt Dorothea's account\nof the disappearance of the French young lady? Yes; the French young\nlady's disappearance on this side the water was only contingent upon her\nreappearance on the other; then he shuddered as he darkly pictured the\npossible sequel of her life, and the wresting from her of her infant,\nand its immurement in the savage mountain wilderness.\n\nBut Isabel had also vague impressions of herself crossing the\nsea;--_re_crossing, emphatically thought Pierre, as he pondered on the\nunbidden conceit, that she had probably first unconsciously and\nsmuggledly crossed it hidden beneath her sorrowing mother's heart. But\nin attempting to draw any inferences, from what he himself had ever\nheard, for a coinciding proof or elucidation of this assumption of\nIsabel's actual crossing the sea at so tender an age; here Pierre felt\nall the inadequateness of both his own and Isabel's united knowledge, to\nclear up the profound mysteriousness of her early life. To the\ncertainty of this irremovable obscurity he bowed himself, and strove to\ndismiss it from his mind, as worse than hopeless. So, also, in a good\ndegree, did he endeavor to drive out of him, Isabel's reminiscence of\nthe, to her, unnameable large house, from which she had been finally\nremoved by the pleasant woman in the coach. This episode in her life,\nabove all other things, was most cruelly suggestive to him, as possibly\ninvolving his father in the privity to a thing, at which Pierre's inmost\nsoul fainted with amazement and abhorrence. Here the helplessness of all\nfurther light, and the eternal impossibility of logically exonerating\nhis dead father, in his own mind, from the liability to this, and many\nother of the blackest self-insinuated suppositions; all this came over\nPierre with a power so infernal and intense, that it could only have\nproceeded from the unretarded malice of the Evil One himself. But\nsubtilly and wantonly as these conceits stole into him, Pierre as\nsubtilly opposed them; and with the hue-and-cry of his whole indignant\nsoul, pursued them forth again into the wide Tartarean realm from which\nthey had emerged.\n\nThe more and the more that Pierre now revolved the story of Isabel in\nhis mind, so much the more he amended his original idea, that much of\nits obscurity would depart upon a second interview. He saw, or seemed to\nsee, that it was not so much Isabel who had by her wild idiosyncrasies\nmystified the narration of her history, as it was the essential and\nunavoidable mystery of her history itself, which had invested Isabel\nwith such wonderful enigmas to him.\n\n\nVIII.\n\nThe issue of these reconsiderings was the conviction, that all he could\nnow reasonably anticipate from Isabel, in further disclosure on the\nsubject of her life, were some few additional particulars bringing it\ndown to the present moment; and, also, possibly filling out the latter\nportion of what she had already revealed to him. Nor here, could he\npersuade himself, that she would have much to say. Isabel had not been\nso digressive and withholding as he had thought. What more, indeed,\ncould she now have to impart, except by what strange means she had at\nlast come to find her brother out; and the dreary recital of how she had\npecuniarily wrestled with her destitute condition; how she had come to\nleave one place of toiling refuge for another, till now he found her in\nhumble servitude at farmer Ulver's? Is it possible then, thought Pierre,\nthat there lives a human creature in this common world of everydays,\nwhose whole history may be told in little less than two-score words, and\nyet embody in that smallness a fathomless fountain of ever-welling\nmystery? Is it possible, after all, that spite of bricks and shaven\nfaces, this world we live in is brimmed with wonders, and I and all\nmankind, beneath our garbs of common-placeness, conceal enigmas that the\nstars themselves, and perhaps the highest seraphim can not resolve?\n\nThe intuitively certain, however literally unproven fact of Isabel's\nsisterhood to him, was a link that he now felt binding him to a before\nunimagined and endless chain of wondering. His very blood seemed to flow\nthrough all his arteries with unwonted subtileness, when he thought that\nthe same tide flowed through the mystic veins of Isabel. All his\noccasional pangs of dubiousness as to the grand governing thing of\nall--the reality of the physical relationship--only recoiled back upon\nhim with added tribute of both certainty and insolubleness.\n\nShe is my sister--my own father's daughter. Well; why do I believe it?\nThe other day I had not so much as heard the remotest rumor of her\nexistence; and what has since occurred to change me? What so new and\nincontestable vouchers have I handled? None at all. But I have seen her.\nWell; grant it; I might have seen a thousand other girls, whom I had\nnever seen before; but for that, I would not own any one among them for\nmy sister. But the portrait, the chair-portrait, Pierre? Think of that.\nBut that was painted before Isabel was born; what can that portrait have\nto do with Isabel? It is not the portrait of Isabel, it is my father's\nportrait; and yet my mother swears it is not he.\n\nNow alive as he was to all these searching argumentative itemizings of\nthe minutest known facts any way bearing upon the subject; and yet, at\nthe same time, persuaded, strong as death, that in spite of them, Isabel\nwas indeed his sister; how could Pierre, naturally poetic, and therefore\npiercing as he was; how could he fail to acknowledge the existence of\nthat all-controlling and all-permeating wonderfulness, which, when\nimperfectly and isolatedly recognized by the generality, is so\nsignificantly denominated The Finger of God? But it is not merely the\nFinger, it is the whole outspread Hand of God; for doth not Scripture\nintimate, that He holdeth all of us in the hollow of His hand?--a\nHollow, truly!\n\nStill wandering through the forest, his eye pursuing its ever-shifting\nshadowy vistas; remote from all visible haunts and traces of that\nstrangely wilful race, who, in the sordid traffickings of clay and mud,\nare ever seeking to denationalize the natural heavenliness of their\nsouls; there came into the mind of Pierre, thoughts and fancies never\nimbibed within the gates of towns; but only given forth by the\natmosphere of primeval forests, which, with the eternal ocean, are the\nonly unchanged general objects remaining to this day, from those that\noriginally met the gaze of Adam. For so it is, that the apparently most\ninflammable or evaporable of all earthly things, wood and water, are, in\nthis view, immensely the most endurable.\n\nNow all his ponderings, however excursive, wheeled round Isabel as their\ncenter; and back to her they came again from every excursion; and again\nderived some new, small germs for wonderment.\n\nThe question of Time occurred to Pierre. How old was Isabel? According\nto all reasonable inferences from the presumed circumstances of her\nlife, she was his elder, certainly, though by uncertain years; yet her\nwhole aspect was that of more than childlikeness; nevertheless, not only\ndid he feel his muscular superiority to her, so to speak, which made him\nspontaneously alive to a feeling of elderly protectingness over her; not\nonly did he experience the thoughts of superior world-acquaintance, and\ngeneral cultured knowledge; but spite of reason's self, and irrespective\nof all mere computings, he was conscious of a feeling which\nindependently pronounced him her senior in point of Time, and Isabel a\nchild of everlasting youngness. This strange, though strong conceit of\nhis mysterious persuasion, doubtless, had its untraced, and but\nlittle-suspected origin in his mind, from ideas born of his devout\nmeditations upon the artless infantileness of her face; which, though\nprofoundly mournful in the general expression, yet did not, by any\nmeans, for that cause, lose one whit in its singular infantileness; as\nthe faces of real infants, in their earliest visibleness, do oft-times\nwear a look of deep and endless sadness. But it was not the sadness, nor\nindeed, strictly speaking, the infantileness of the face of Isabel which\nso singularly impressed him with the idea of her original and changeless\nyouthfulness. It was something else; yet something which entirely eluded\nhim.\n\nImaginatively exalted by the willing suffrages of all mankind into\nhigher and purer realms than men themselves inhabit; beautiful\nwomen--those of them at least who are beautiful in soul as well as\nbody--do, notwithstanding the relentless law of earthly fleetingness,\nstill seem, for a long interval, mysteriously exempt from the\nincantations of decay; for as the outward loveliness touch by touch\ndeparts, the interior beauty touch by touch replaces that departing\nbloom, with charms, which, underivable from earth, possess the\nineffaceableness of stars. Else, why at the age of sixty, have some\nwomen held in the strongest bonds of love and fealty, men young enough\nto be their grandsons? And why did all-seducing Ninon unintendingly\nbreak scores of hearts at seventy? It is because of the perennialness of\nwomanly sweetness.\n\nOut from the infantile, yet eternal mournfulness of the face of Isabel,\nthere looked on Pierre that angelic childlikeness, which our Savior\nhints is the one only investiture of translated souls; for of such--even\nof little children--is the other world.\n\nNow, unending as the wonderful rivers, which once bathed the feet of the\nprimeval generations, and still remain to flow fast by the graves of all\nsucceeding men, and by the beds of all now living; unending,\never-flowing, ran through the soul of Pierre, fresh and fresher, further\nand still further, thoughts of Isabel. But the more his thoughtful river\nran, the more mysteriousness it floated to him; and yet the more\ncertainty that the mysteriousness was unchangeable. In her life there\nwas an unraveled plot; and he felt that unraveled it would eternally\nremain to him. No slightest hope or dream had he, that what was dark and\nmournful in her would ever be cleared up into some coming atmosphere of\nlight and mirth. Like all youths, Pierre had conned his novel-lessons;\nhad read more novels than most persons of his years; but their false,\ninverted attempts at systematizing eternally unsystemizable elements;\ntheir audacious, intermeddling impotency, in trying to unravel, and\nspread out, and classify, the more thin than gossamer threads which make\nup the complex web of life; these things over Pierre had no power now.\nStraight through their helpless miserableness he pierced; the one\nsensational truth in him transfixed like beetles all the speculative\nlies in them. He saw that human life doth truly come from that, which\nall men are agreed to call by the name of _God_; and that it partakes of\nthe unravelable inscrutableness of God. By infallible presentiment he\nsaw, that not always doth life's beginning gloom conclude in gladness;\nthat wedding-bells peal not ever in the last scene of life's fifth act;\nthat while the countless tribes of common novels laboriously spin veils\nof mystery, only to complacently clear them up at last; and while the\ncountless tribe of common dramas do but repeat the same; yet the\nprofounder emanations of the human mind, intended to illustrate all that\ncan be humanly known of human life; these never unravel their own\nintricacies, and have no proper endings; but in imperfect,\nunanticipated, and disappointing sequels (as mutilated stumps), hurry to\nabrupt intermergings with the eternal tides of time and fate.\n\nSo Pierre renounced all thought of ever having Isabel's dark lantern\nilluminated to him. Her light was lidded, and the lid was locked. Nor\ndid he feel a pang at this. By posting hither and thither among the\nreminiscences of his family, and craftily interrogating his remaining\nrelatives on his father's side, he might possibly rake forth some few\nsmall grains of dubious and most unsatisfying things, which, were he\nthat way strongly bent, would only serve the more hopelessly to cripple\nhim in his practical resolves. He determined to pry not at all into this\nsacred problem. For him now the mystery of Isabel possessed all the\nbewitchingness of the mysterious vault of night, whose very darkness\nevokes the witchery.\n\nThe thoughtful river still ran on in him, and now it floated still\nanother thing to him.\n\nThough the letter of Isabel gushed with all a sister's sacred longings\nto embrace her brother, and in the most abandoned terms painted the\nanguish of her life-long estrangement from him; and though, in effect,\nit took vows to this,--that without his continual love and sympathy,\nfurther life for her was only fit to be thrown into the nearest\nunfathomed pool, or rushing stream; yet when the brother and the sister\nhad encountered, according to the set appointment, none of these\nimpassionedments had been repeated. She had more than thrice thanked\nGod, and most earnestly blessed himself, that now he had come near to\nher in her loneliness; but no gesture of common and customary sisterly\naffection. Nay, from his embrace had she not struggled? nor kissed him\nonce; nor had he kissed her, except when the salute was solely sought by\nhim.\n\nNow Pierre began to see mysteries interpierced with mysteries, and\nmysteries eluding mysteries; and began to seem to see the mere\nimaginariness of the so supposed solidest principle of human\nassociation. Fate had done this thing for them. Fate had separated the\nbrother and the sister, till to each other they somehow seemed so not at\nall. Sisters shrink not from their brother's kisses. And Pierre felt\nthat never, never would he be able to embrace Isabel with the mere\nbrotherly embrace; while the thought of any other caress, which took\nhold of any domesticness, was entirely vacant from his uncontaminated\nsoul, for it had never consciously intruded there.\n\nTherefore, forever unsistered for him by the stroke of Fate, and\napparently forever, and twice removed from the remotest possibility of\nthat love which had drawn him to his Lucy; yet still the object of the\nardentest and deepest emotions of his soul; therefore, to him, Isabel\nwholly soared out of the realms of mortalness, and for him became\ntransfigured in the highest heaven of uncorrupted Love.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK VIII.\n\nTHE SECOND INTERVIEW AT THE FARM-HOUSE, AND THE SECOND PART OF THE STORY\nOF ISABEL. THEIR IMMEDIATE IMPULSIVE EFFECT UPON PIERRE.\n\n\nI.\n\nHis second interview with Isabel was more satisfying, but none the less\naffecting and mystical than the first, though in the beginning, to his\nno small surprise, it was far more strange and embarrassing.\n\nAs before, Isabel herself admitted him into the farm-house, and spoke no\nword to him till they were both seated in the room of the double\ncasement, and himself had first addressed her. If Pierre had any way\npredetermined how to deport himself at the moment, it was to manifest by\nsome outward token the utmost affection for his sister; but her rapt\nsilence and that atmosphere of unearthliness which invested her, now\nfroze him to his seat; his arms refused to open, his lips refused to\nmeet in the fraternal kiss; while all the while his heart was\noverflowing with the deepest love, and he knew full well, that his\npresence was inexpressibly grateful to the girl. Never did love and\nreverence so intimately react and blend; never did pity so join with\nwonder in casting a spell upon the movements of his body, and impeding\nhim in its command.\n\nAfter a few embarrassed words from Pierre, and a brief reply, a pause\nensued, during which not only was the slow, soft stepping overhead\nquite audible, as at intervals on the night before, but also some slight\ndomestic sounds were heard from the adjoining room; and noticing the\nunconsciously interrogating expression of Pierre's face, Isabel thus\nspoke to him:\n\n\"I feel, my brother, that thou dost appreciate the peculiarity and the\nmystery of my life, and of myself, and therefore I am at rest concerning\nthe possibility of thy misconstruing any of my actions. It is only when\npeople refuse to admit the uncommonness of some persons and the\ncircumstances surrounding them, that erroneous conceits are nourished,\nand their feelings pained. My brother, if ever I shall seem reserved and\nunembracing to thee, still thou must ever trust the heart of Isabel, and\npermit no doubt to cross thee there. My brother, the sounds thou hast\njust overheard in yonder room, have suggested to thee interesting\nquestions connected with myself. Do not speak; I fervently understand\nthee. I will tell thee upon what terms I have been living here; and how\nit is that I, a hired person, am enabled to receive thee in this seemly\nprivacy; for as thou mayest very readily imagine, this room is not my\nown. And this reminds me also that I have yet some few further trifling\nthings to tell thee respecting the circumstances which have ended in\nbestowing upon me so angelical a brother.\"\n\n\"I can not retain that word\"--said Pierre, with earnest lowness, and\ndrawing a little nearer to her--\"of right, it only pertains to thee.\"\n\n\"My brother, I will now go on, and tell thee all that I think thou\ncouldst wish to know, in addition to what was so dimly rehearsed last\nnight. Some three months ago, the people of the distant farm-house,\nwhere I was then staying, broke up their household and departed for some\nWestern country. No place immediately presented itself where my services\nwere wanted, but I was hospitably received at an old neighbor's hearth,\nand most kindly invited to tarry there, till some employ should offer.\nBut I did not wait for chance to help me; my inquiries resulted in\nascertaining the sad story of Delly Ulver, and that through the fate\nwhich had overtaken her, her aged parents were not only plunged into the\nmost poignant grief, but were deprived of the domestic help of an only\ndaughter, a circumstance whose deep discomfort can not be easily\nrealized by persons who have always been ministered to by servants.\nThough indeed my natural mood--if I may call it so, for want of a better\nterm--was strangely touched by thinking that the misery of Delly should\nbe the source of benefit to me; yet this had no practically operative\neffect upon me,--my most inmost and truest thoughts seldom have;--and so\nI came hither, and my hands will testify that I did not come entirely\nfor naught. Now, my brother, since thou didst leave me yesterday, I have\nfelt no small surprise, that thou didst not then seek from me, how and\nwhen I came to learn the name of Glendinning as so closely associated\nwith myself; and how I came to know Saddle Meadows to be the family\nseat, and how I at last resolved upon addressing thee, Pierre, and none\nother; and to what may be attributed that very memorable scene in the\nsewing-circle at the Miss Pennies.\"\n\n\"I have myself been wondering at myself that these things should\nhitherto have so entirely absented themselves from my mind,\" responded\nPierre;--\"but truly, Isabel, thy all-abounding hair falls upon me with\nsome spell which dismisses all ordinary considerations from me, and\nleaves me only sensible to the Nubian power in thine eyes. But go on,\nand tell me every thing and any thing. I desire to know all, Isabel, and\nyet, nothing which thou wilt not voluntarily disclose. I feel that\nalready I know the pith of all; that already I feel toward thee to the\nvery limit of all; and that, whatever remains for thee to tell me, can\nbut corroborate and confirm. So go on, my dearest,--ay, my only sister.\"\n\nIsabel fixed her wonderful eyes upon him with a gaze of long\nimpassionment; then rose suddenly to her feet, and advanced swiftly\ntoward him; but more suddenly paused, and reseated herself in silence,\nand continued so for a time, with her head averted from him, and mutely\nresting on her hand, gazing out of the open casement upon the soft\nheat-lightning, occasionally revealed there.\n\nShe resumed anon.\n\n\nII.\n\n\"My brother, thou wilt remember that certain part of my story which in\nreference to my more childish years spent remote from here, introduced\nthe gentleman--my--yes, _our_ father, Pierre. I can not describe to\nthee, for indeed, I do not myself comprehend how it was, that though at\nthe time I sometimes called him my father, and the people of the house\nalso called him so, sometimes when speaking of him to me; yet--partly, I\nsuppose, because of the extraordinary secludedness of my previous\nlife--I did not then join in my mind with the word father, all those\npeculiar associations which the term ordinarily inspires in children.\nThe word father only seemed a word of general love and endearment to\nme--little or nothing more; it did not seem to involve any claims of any\nsort, one way or the other. I did not ask the name of my father; for I\ncould have had no motive to hear him named, except to individualize the\nperson who was so peculiarly kind to me; and individualized in that way\nhe already was, since he was generally called by us _the gentleman_, and\nsometimes _my father_. As I have no reason to suppose that had I then or\nafterward, questioned the people of the house as to what more particular\nname my father went by in the world, they would have at all disclosed it\nto me; and, indeed, since, for certain singular reasons, I now feel\nconvinced that on that point they were pledged to secrecy; I do not\nknow that I ever would have come to learn my father's name,--and by\nconsequence, ever have learned the least shade or shadow of knowledge as\nto you, Pierre, or any of your kin--had it not been for the merest\nlittle accident, which early revealed it to me, though at the moment I\ndid not know the value of that knowledge. The last time my father\nvisited the house, he chanced to leave his handkerchief behind him. It\nwas the farmer's wife who first discovered it. She picked it up, and\nfumbling at it a moment, as if rapidly examining the corners, tossed it\nto me, saying, 'Here, Isabel, here is the good gentleman's handkerchief;\nkeep it for him now, till he comes to see little Bell again.' Gladly I\ncaught the handkerchief, and put it into my bosom. It was a white one;\nand upon closely scanning it, I found a small line of fine faded\nyellowish writing in the middle of it. At that time I could not read\neither print or writing, so I was none the wiser then; but still, some\nsecret instinct told me, that the woman would not so freely have given\nme the handkerchief, had she known there was any writing on it. I\nforbore questioning her on the subject; I waited till my father should\nreturn, to secretly question him. The handkerchief had become dusty by\nlying on the uncarpeted floor. I took it to the brook and washed it, and\nlaid it out on the grass where none would chance to pass; and I ironed\nit under my little apron, so that none would be attracted to it, to look\nat it again. But my father never returned; so, in my grief, the\nhandkerchief became the more and the more endeared to me; it absorbed\nmany of the secret tears I wept in memory of my dear departed friend,\nwhom, in my child-like ignorance, I then equally called _my father_ and\n_the gentleman_. But when the impression of his death became a fixed\nthing to me, then again I washed and dried and ironed the precious\nmemorial of him, and put it away where none should find it but myself,\nand resolved never more to soil it with my tears; and I folded it in\nsuch a manner, that the name was invisibly buried in the heart of it,\nand it was like opening a book and turning over many blank leaves before\nI came to the mysterious writing, which I knew should be one day read by\nme, without direct help from any one. Now I resolved to learn my\nletters, and learn to read, in order that of myself I might learn the\nmeaning of those faded characters. No other purpose but that only one,\ndid I have in learning then to read. I easily induced the woman to give\nme my little teachings, and being uncommonly quick, and moreover, most\neager to learn, I soon mastered the alphabet, and went on to spelling,\nand by-and-by to reading, and at last to the complete deciphering of the\ntalismanic word--Glendinning. I was yet very ignorant. _Glendinning_,\nthought I, what is that? It sounds something like\n_gentleman_;--Glen-din-ning;--just as many syllables as _gentleman_;\nand--G--it begins with the same letter; yes, it must mean _my father_. I\nwill think of him by that word now;--I will not think of the\n_gentleman_, but of _Glendinning_. When at last I removed from that\nhouse and went to another, and still another, and as I still grew up and\nthought more to myself, that word was ever humming in my head, I saw it\nwould only prove the key to more. But I repressed all undue curiosity,\nif any such has ever filled my breast. I would not ask of any one, who\nit was that had been Glendinning; where he had lived; whether, ever any\nother girl or boy had called him father as I had done. I resolved to\nhold myself in perfect patience, as somehow mystically certain, that\nFate would at last disclose to me, of itself, and at the suitable time,\nwhatever Fate thought it best for me to know. But now, my brother, I\nmust go aside a little for a moment.--Hand me the guitar.\"\n\nSurprised and rejoiced thus far at the unanticipated newness, and the\nsweet lucidness and simplicity of Isabel's narrating, as compared with\nthe obscure and marvelous revelations of the night before, and all eager\nfor her to continue her story in the same limpid manner, but\nremembering into what a wholly tumultuous and unearthly frame of mind\nthe melodies of her guitar had formerly thrown him; Pierre now, in\nhanding the instrument to Isabel, could not entirely restrain something\nlike a look of half-regret, accompanied rather strangely with a\nhalf-smile of gentle humor. It did not pass unnoticed by his sister, who\nreceiving the guitar, looked up into his face with an expression which\nwould almost have been arch and playful, were it not for the\never-abiding shadows cast from her infinite hair into her unfathomed\neyes, and redoubledly shot back again from them.\n\n\"Do not be alarmed, my brother; and do not smile at me; I am not going\nto play the Mystery of Isabel to thee to-night. Draw nearer to me now.\nHold the light near to me.\"\n\nSo saying she loosened some ivory screws of the guitar, so as to open a\npeep lengthwise through its interior.\n\n\"Now hold it thus, my brother; thus; and see what thou wilt see; but\nwait one instant till I hold the lamp.\" So saying, as Pierre held the\ninstrument before him as directed, Isabel held the lamp so as to cast\nits light through the round sounding-hole into the heart of the guitar.\n\n\"Now, Pierre, now.\"\n\nEagerly Pierre did as he was bid; but somehow felt disappointed, and yet\nsurprised at what he saw. He saw the word _Isabel_, quite legibly but\nstill fadedly gilded upon a part of one side of the interior, where it\nmade a projecting curve.\n\n\"A very curious place thou hast chosen, Isabel, wherein to have the\nownership of the guitar engraved. How did ever any person get in there\nto do it, I should like to know?\"\n\nThe girl looked surprisedly at him a moment; then took the instrument\nfrom him, and looked into it herself. She put it down, and continued.\n\n\"I see, my brother, thou dost not comprehend. When one knows every thing\nabout any object, one is too apt to suppose that the slightest hint\nwill suffice to throw it quite as open to any other person. _I_ did not\nhave the name gilded there, my brother.\"\n\n\"How?\" cried Pierre.\n\n\"The name was gilded there when I first got the guitar, though then I\ndid not know it. The guitar must have been expressly made for some one\nby the name of Isabel; because the lettering could only have been put\nthere before the guitar was put together.\"\n\n\"Go on--hurry,\" said Pierre.\n\n\"Yes, one day, after I had owned it a long time, a strange whim came\ninto me. Thou know'st that it is not at all uncommon for children to\nbreak their dearest playthings in order to gratify a half-crazy\ncuriosity to find out what is in the hidden heart of them. So it is with\nchildren, sometimes. And, Pierre, I have always been, and feel that I\nmust always continue to be a child, though I should grow to three score\nyears and ten. Seized with this sudden whim, I unscrewed the part I\nshowed thee, and peeped in, and saw 'Isabel.' Now I have not yet told\nthee, that from as early a time as I can remember, I have nearly always\ngone by the name of Bell. And at the particular time I now speak of, my\nknowledge of general and trivial matters was sufficiently advanced to\nmake it quite a familiar thing to me, that Bell was often a diminutive\nfor Isabella, or Isabel. It was therefore no very strange affair, that\nconsidering my age, and other connected circumstances at the time, I\nshould have instinctively associated the word Isabel, found in the\nguitar, with my own abbreviated name, and so be led into all sorts of\nfancyings. They return upon me now. Do not speak to me.\"\n\nShe leaned away from him, toward the occasionally illuminated casement,\nin the same manner as on the previous night, and for a few moments\nseemed struggling with some wild bewilderment But now she suddenly\nturned, and fully confronted Pierre with all the wonderfulness of her\nmost surprising face.\n\n\"I am called woman, and thou, man, Pierre; but there is neither man nor\nwoman about it. Why should I not speak out to thee? There is no sex in\nour immaculateness. Pierre, the secret name in the guitar even now\nthrills me through and through. Pierre, think! think! Oh, canst thou not\ncomprehend? see it?--what I mean, Pierre? The secret name in the guitar\nthrills me, thrills me, whirls me, whirls me; so secret, wholly hidden,\nyet constantly carried about in it; unseen, unsuspected, always\nvibrating to the hidden heart-strings--broken heart-strings; oh, my\nmother, my mother, my mother!\"\n\nAs the wild plaints of Isabel pierced into his bosom's core, they\ncarried with them the first inkling of the extraordinary conceit, so\nvaguely and shrinkingly hinted at in her till now entirely\nunintelligible words.\n\nShe lifted her dry burning eyes of long-fringed fire to him.\n\n\"Pierre--I have no slightest proof--but the guitar was _hers_, I know, I\nfeel it was. Say, did I not last night tell thee, how it first sung to\nme upon the bed, and answered me, without my once touching it? and how\nit always sung to me and answered me, and soothed and loved me,--Hark\nnow; thou shalt hear my mother's spirit.\"\n\nShe carefully scanned the strings, and tuned them carefully; then placed\nthe guitar in the casement-bench, and knelt before it; and in low,\nsweet, and changefully modulated notes, so barely audible, that Pierre\nbent over to catch them; breathed the word _mother, mother, mother_!\nThere was profound silence for a time; when suddenly, to the lowest and\nleast audible note of all, the magical untouched guitar responded with a\nquick spark of melody, which in the following hush, long vibrated and\nsubsidingly tingled through the room; while to his augmented wonder, he\nnow espied, quivering along the metallic strings of the guitar, some\nminute scintillations, seemingly caught from the instrument's close\nproximity to the occasionally irradiated window.\n\nThe girl still kept kneeling; but an altogether unwonted expression\nsuddenly overcast her whole countenance. She darted one swift glance at\nPierre; and then with a single toss of her hand tumbled her unrestrained\nlocks all over her, so that they tent-wise invested her whole kneeling\nform close to the floor, and yet swept the floor with their wild\nredundancy. Never Saya of Limeean girl, at dim mass in St. Dominic's\ncathedral, so completely muffled the human figure. To Pierre, the deep\noaken recess of the double-casement, before which Isabel was kneeling,\nseemed now the immediate vestibule of some awful shrine, mystically\nrevealed through the obscurely open window, which ever and anon was\nstill softly illumined by the mild heat-lightnings and\nground-lightnings, that wove their wonderfulness without, in the\nunsearchable air of that ebonly warm and most noiseless summer night.\n\nSome unsubduable word was on Pierre's lip, but a sudden voice from out\nthe veil bade him be silent.\n\n\"Mother--mother--mother!\"\n\nAgain, after a preluding silence, the guitar as magically responded as\nbefore; the sparks quivered along its strings; and again Pierre felt as\nin the immediate presence of the spirit.\n\n\"Shall I, mother?--Art thou ready? Wilt thou tell me?--Now? Now?\"\n\nThese words were lowly and sweetly murmured in the same way with the\nword _mother_, being changefully varied in their modulations, till at\nthe last _now_, the magical guitar again responded; and the girl swiftly\ndrew it to her beneath her dark tent of hair. In this act, as the long\ncurls swept over the strings of the guitar, the strange sparks--still\nquivering there--caught at those attractive curls; the entire casement\nwas suddenly and wovenly illumined; then waned again; while now, in the\nsucceeding dimness, every downward undulating wave and billow of\nIsabel's tossed tresses gleamed here and there like a tract of\nphosphorescent midnight sea; and, simultaneously, all the four winds of\nthe world of melody broke loose, and again as on the previous night,\nonly in a still more subtile, and wholly inexplicable way, Pierre felt\nhimself surrounded by ten thousand sprites and gnomes, and his whole\nsoul was swayed and tossed by supernatural tides; and again he heard the\nwondrous, rebounding, chanted words:\n\n    \"Mystery! Mystery!\n     Mystery of Isabel!\n     Mystery! Mystery!\n     Isabel and Mystery!\n         Mystery!\"\n\n\nIII.\n\nAlmost deprived of consciousness by the spell flung over him by the\nmarvelous girl, Pierre unknowingly gazed away from her, as on vacancy;\nand when at last stillness had once more fallen upon the room--all\nexcept the stepping--and he recovered his self-possession, and turned to\nlook where he might now be, he was surprised to see Isabel composedly,\nthough avertedly, seated on the bench; the longer and fuller tresses of\nher now ungleaming hair flung back, and the guitar quietly leaning in\nthe corner.\n\nHe was about to put some unconsidered question to her, but she\nhalf-anticipated it by bidding him, in a low, but nevertheless almost\nauthoritative tone, not to make any allusion to the scene he had just\nbeheld.\n\nHe paused, profoundly thinking to himself, and now felt certain that the\nentire scene, from the first musical invocation of the guitar, must have\nunpremeditatedly proceeded from a sudden impulse in the girl, inspired\nby the peculiar mood into which the preceding conversation, and\nespecially the handling of the guitar under such circumstances, had\nirresistibly thrown her.\n\nBut that certain something of the preternatural in the scene, of which\nhe could not rid his mind:--the, so to speak, voluntary and all but\nintelligent responsiveness of the guitar--its strangely scintillating\nstrings--the so suddenly glorified head of Isabel; altogether, these\nthings seemed not at the time entirely produced by customary or natural\ncauses. To Pierre's dilated senses Isabel seemed to swim in an electric\nfluid; the vivid buckler of her brow seemed as a magnetic plate. Now\nfirst this night was Pierre made aware of what, in the superstitiousness\nof his rapt enthusiasm, he could not help believing was an extraordinary\nphysical magnetism in Isabel. And--as it were derived from this\nmarvelous quality thus imputed to her--he now first became vaguely\nsensible of a certain still more marvelous power in the girl over\nhimself and his most interior thoughts and motions;--a power so hovering\nupon the confines of the invisible world, that it seemed more inclined\nthat way than this;--a power which not only seemed irresistibly to draw\nhim toward Isabel, but to draw him away from another quarter--wantonly\nas it were, and yet quite ignorantly and unintendingly; and, besides,\nwithout respect apparently to any thing ulterior, and yet again, only\nunder cover of drawing him to her. For over all these things, and\ninterfusing itself with the sparkling electricity in which she seemed to\nswim, was an ever-creeping and condensing haze of ambiguities. Often, in\nafter-times with her, did he recall this first magnetic night, and would\nseem to see that she then had bound him to her by an extraordinary\natmospheric spell--both physical and spiritual--which henceforth it had\nbecome impossible for him to break, but whose full potency he never\nrecognized till long after he had become habituated to its sway. This\nspell seemed one with that Pantheistic master-spell, which eternally\nlocks in mystery and in muteness the universal subject world, and the\nphysical electricalness of Isabel seemed reciprocal with the\nheat-lightnings and the ground-lightnings nigh to which it had first\nbecome revealed to Pierre. She seemed molded from fire and air, and\nvivified at some Voltaic pile of August thunder-clouds heaped against\nthe sunset.\n\nThe occasional sweet simplicity, and innocence, and humbleness of her\nstory; her often serene and open aspect; her deep-seated, but mostly\nquiet, unobtrusive sadness, and that touchingness of her less unwonted\ntone and air;--these only the more signalized and contrastingly\nemphasized the profounder, subtler, and more mystic part of her.\nEspecially did Pierre feel this, when after another silent interval, she\nnow proceeded with her story in a manner so gently confiding, so\nentirely artless, so almost peasant-like in its simplicity, and dealing\nin some details so little sublimated in themselves, that it seemed well\nnigh impossible that this unassuming maid should be the same dark, regal\nbeing who had but just now bade Pierre be silent in so imperious a tone,\nand around whose wondrous temples the strange electric glory had been\nplaying. Yet not very long did she now thus innocently proceed, ere, at\ntimes, some fainter flashes of her electricalness came from her, but\nonly to be followed by such melting, human, and most feminine traits as\nbrought all his soft, enthusiast tears into the sympathetic but still\nunshedding eyes of Pierre.\n\n\nIV.\n\n\"Thou rememberest, my brother, my telling thee last night, how\nthe--the--thou knowest what I mean--_that, there_\"--avertedly pointing\nto the guitar; \"thou rememberest how it came into my possession. But\nperhaps I did not tell thee, that the pedler said he had got it in\nbarter from the servants of a great house some distance from the place\nwhere I was then residing.\"\n\nPierre signed his acquiescence, and Isabel proceeded:\n\n\"Now, at long though stated intervals, that man passed the farm-house in\nhis trading route between the small towns and villages. When I\ndiscovered the gilding in the guitar, I kept watch for him; for though I\ntruly felt persuaded that Fate had the dispensing of her own secrets in\nher own good time; yet I also felt persuaded that in some cases Fate\ndrops us one little hint, leaving our own minds to follow it up, so that\nwe of ourselves may come to the grand secret in reserve. So I kept\ndiligent watch for him; and the next time he stopped, without permitting\nhim at all to guess my motives, I contrived to steal out of him what\ngreat house it was from which the guitar had come. And, my brother, it\nwas the mansion of Saddle Meadows.\"\n\nPierre started, and the girl went on:\n\n\"Yes, my brother, Saddle Meadows; 'old General Glendinning's place,' he\nsaid; 'but the old hero's long dead and gone now; and--the more's the\npity--so is the young General, his son, dead and gone; but then there is\na still younger grandson General left; that family always keep the title\nand the name a-going; yes, even to the surname,--Pierre. Pierre\nGlendinning was the white-haired old General's name, who fought in the\nold French and Indian wars; and Pierre Glendinning is his young\ngreat-grandson's name.' Thou may'st well look at me so, my\nbrother;--yes, he meant thee, _thee_, my brother.\"\n\n\"But the guitar--the guitar!\"--cried Pierre--\"how came the guitar openly\nat Saddle Meadows, and how came it to be bartered away by servants? Tell\nme that, Isabel!\"\n\n\"Do not put such impetuous questions to me, Pierre; else thou mayst\nrecall the old--may be, it is the evil spell upon me. I can not\nprecisely and knowingly answer thee. I could surmise; but what are\nsurmises worth? Oh, Pierre, better, a million times, and far sweeter are\nmysteries than surmises: though the mystery be unfathomable, it is still\nthe unfathomableness of fullness; but the surmise, that is but shallow\nand unmeaning emptiness.\"\n\n\"But this is the most inexplicable point of all. Tell me, Isabel; surely\nthou must have thought something about this thing.\"\n\n\"Much, Pierre, very much; but only about the mystery of it--nothing\nmore. Could I, I would not now be fully told, how the guitar came to be\nat Saddle Meadows, and came to be bartered away by the servants of\nSaddle Meadows. Enough, that it found me out, and came to me, and spoke\nand sung to me, and soothed me, and has been every thing to me.\"\n\nShe paused a moment; while vaguely to his secret self Pierre revolved\nthese strange revealings; but now he was all attention again as Isabel\nresumed.\n\n\"I now held in my mind's hand the clew, my brother. But I did not\nimmediately follow it further up. Sufficient to me in my loneliness was\nthe knowledge, that I now knew where my father's family was to be found.\nAs yet not the slightest intention of ever disclosing myself to them,\nhad entered my mind. And assured as I was, that for obvious reasons,\nnone of his surviving relatives could possibly know me, even if they saw\nme, for what I really was, I felt entire security in the event of\nencountering any of them by chance. But my unavoidable displacements and\nmigrations from one house to another, at last brought me within twelve\nmiles of Saddle Meadows. I began to feel an increasing longing in me;\nbut side by side with it, a new-born and competing pride,--yes, pride,\nPierre. Do my eyes flash? They belie me, if they do not. But it is no\ncommon pride, Pierre; for what has Isabel to be proud of in this world?\nIt is the pride of--of--a too, too longing, loving heart, Pierre--the\npride of lasting suffering and grief, my brother! Yes, I conquered the\ngreat longing with the still more powerful pride, Pierre; and so I would\nnot now be here, in this room,--nor wouldst thou ever have received any\nline from me; nor, in all worldly probability, ever so much as heard of\nher who is called Isabel Banford, had it not been for my hearing that at\nWalter Ulver's, only three miles from the mansion of Saddle Meadows,\npoor Bell would find people kind enough to give her wages for her work.\nFeel my hand, my brother.\"\n\n\"Dear divine girl, my own exalted Isabel!\" cried Pierre, catching the\noffered hand with ungovernable emotion, \"how most unbeseeming, that this\nstrange hardness, and this still stranger littleness should be united in\nany human hand. But hard and small, it by an opposite analogy hints of\nthe soft capacious heart that made the hand so hard with heavenly\nsubmission to thy most undeserved and martyred lot. Would, Isabel, that\nthese my kisses on the hand, were on the heart itself, and dropt the\nseeds of eternal joy and comfort there.\"\n\nHe leaped to his feet, and stood before her with such warm, god-like\nmajesty of love and tenderness, that the girl gazed up at him as though\nhe were the one benignant star in all her general night.\n\n\"Isabel,\" cried Pierre, \"I stand the sweet penance in my father's stead,\nthou, in thy mother's. By our earthly acts we shall redeemingly bless\nboth their eternal lots; we will love with the pure and perfect love of\nangel to an angel. If ever I fall from thee, dear Isabel, may Pierre\nfall from himself; fall back forever into vacant nothingness and night!\"\n\n\"My brother, my brother, speak not so to me; it is too much; unused to\nany love ere now, thine, so heavenly and immense, falls crushing on me!\nSuch love is almost hard to bear as hate. Be still; do not speak to me.\"\n\nThey were both silent for a time; when she went on.\n\n\"Yes, my brother, Fate had now brought me within three miles of thee;\nand--but shall I go straight on, and tell thee all, Pierre? all? every\nthing? art thou of such divineness, that I may speak straight on, in all\nmy thoughts, heedless whither they may flow, or what things they may\nfloat to me?\"\n\n\"Straight on, and fearlessly,\" said Pierre.\n\n\"By chance I saw thy mother, Pierre, and under such circumstances that I\n_knew_ her to be thy mother; and--but shall I go on?\"\n\n\"Straight on, my Isabel; thou didst see my mother--well?\"\n\n\"And when I saw her, though I spake not to her, nor she to me, yet\nstraightway my heart knew that she would love me not.\"\n\n\"Thy heart spake true,\" muttered Pierre to himself; \"go on.\"\n\n\"I re-swore an oath never to reveal myself to thy mother.\"\n\n\"Oath well sworn,\" again he muttered; \"go on.\"\n\n\"But I saw _thee_, Pierre; and, more than ever filled my mother toward\nthy father, Pierre, then upheaved in me. Straightway I knew that if ever\nI should come to be made known to thee, then thy own generous love would\nopen itself to me.\"\n\n\"Again thy heart spake true,\" he murmured; \"go on--and didst thou\nre-swear again?\"\n\n\"No, Pierre; but yes, I did. I swore that thou wert my brother; with\nlove and pride I swore, that young and noble Pierre Glendinning was my\nbrother!\"\n\n\"And only that?\"\n\n\"Nothing more, Pierre; not to thee even, did I ever think to reveal\nmyself.\"\n\n\"How then? thou _art_ revealed to me.\"\n\n\"Yes; but the great God did it, Pierre--not poor Bell. Listen.\n\n\"I felt very dreary here; poor, dear Delly--thou must have heard\nsomething of her story--a most sorrowful house, Pierre. Hark! that is\nher seldom-pausing pacing thou hearest from the floor above. So she\nkeeps ever pacing, pacing, pacing; in her track, all thread-bare,\nPierre, is her chamber-rug. Her father will not look upon her; her\nmother, she hath cursed her to her face. Out of yon chamber, Pierre,\nDelly hath not slept, for now four weeks and more; nor ever hath she\nonce laid upon her bed; it was last made up five weeks ago; but paces,\npaces, paces, all through the night, till after twelve; and then sits\nvacant in her chair. Often I would go to her to comfort her; but she\nsays, 'Nay, nay, nay,' to me through the door; says 'Nay, nay, nay,' and\nonly nay to me, through the bolted door; bolted three weeks ago--when I\nby cunning arts stole her dead baby from her, and with these fingers,\nalone, by night, scooped out a hollow, and, seconding heaven's own\ncharitable stroke, buried that sweet, wee symbol of her not unpardonable\nshame far from the ruthless foot of man--yes, bolted three weeks ago,\nnot once unbolted since; her food I must thrust through the little\nwindow in her closet. Pierre, hardly these two handfuls has she eaten in\na week.\"\n\n\"Curses, wasp-like, cohere on that villain, Ned, and sting him to his\ndeath!\" cried Pierre, smit by this most piteous tale. \"What can be done\nfor her, sweet Isabel; can Pierre do aught?\"\n\n\"If thou or I do not, then the ever-hospitable grave will prove her\nquick refuge, Pierre. Father and mother both, are worse than dead and\ngone to her. They would have turned her forth, I think, but for my own\npoor petitionings, unceasing in her behalf!\"\n\nPierre's deep concern now gave place to a momentary look of benevolent\nintelligence.\n\n\"Isabel, a thought of benefit to Delly has just entered me; but I am\nstill uncertain how best it may be acted on. Resolved I am though to\nsuccor her. Do thou still hold her here yet awhile, by thy sweet\npetitionings, till my further plans are more matured. Now run on with\nthy story, and so divert me from the pacing;--her every step steps in my\nsoul.\"\n\n\"Thy noble heart hath many chambers, Pierre; the records of thy wealth,\nI see, are not bound up in the one poor book of Isabel, my brother. Thou\nart a visible token, Pierre, of the invisible angel-hoods, which in our\ndarker hours we do sometimes distrust. The gospel of thy acts goes very\nfar, my brother. Were all men like to thee, then were there no men at\nall,--mankind extinct in seraphim!\"\n\n\"Praises are for the base, my sister, cunningly to entice them to fair\nVirtue by our ignorings of the ill in them, and our imputings of the\ngood not theirs. So make not my head to hang, sweet Isabel. Praise me\nnot. Go on now with thy tale.\"\n\n\"I have said to thee, my brother, how most dreary I found it here, and\nfrom the first. Wonted all my life to sadness--if it be such--still,\nthis house hath such acuteness in its general grief, such hopelessness\nand despair of any slightest remedy--that even poor Bell could scarce\nabide it always, without some little going forth into contrasting\nscenes. So I went forth into the places of delight, only that I might\nreturn more braced to minister in the haunts of woe. For continual\nunchanging residence therein, doth but bring on woe's stupor, and make\nus as dead. So I went forth betimes; visiting the neighboring cottages;\nwhere there were chattering children, and no one place vacant at the\ncheerful board. Thus at last I chanced to hear of the Sewing Circle to\nbe held at the Miss Pennies'; and how that they were anxious to press\ninto their kind charity all the maidens of the country round. In various\ncottages, I was besought to join; and they at length persuaded me; not\nthat I was naturally loth to it, and needed such entreaties; but at\nfirst I felt great fear, lest at such a scene I might closely encounter\nsome of the Glendinnings; and that thought was then namelessly repulsive\nto me. But by stealthy inquiries I learned, that the lady of the\nmanorial-house would not be present;--it proved deceptive\ninformation;--but I went; and all the rest thou knowest.\"\n\n\"I do, sweet Isabel, but thou must tell it over to me; and all thy\nemotions there.\"\n\n\nV.\n\n\"Though but one day hath passed, my brother, since we first met in life,\nyet thou hast that heavenly magnet in thee, which draws all my soul's\ninterior to thee. I will go on.--Having to wait for a neighbor's wagon,\nI arrived but late at the Sewing Circle. When I entered, the two joined\nrooms were very full. With the farmer's girls, our neighbors, I passed\nalong to the further corner, where thou didst see me; and as I went,\nsome heads were turned, and some whisperings I heard, of--'She's the new\nhelp at poor Walter Ulver's--the strange girl they've got--she thinks\nherself 'mazing pretty, I'll be bound;--but nobody knows her--Oh, how\ndemure!--but not over-good, I guess;--I wouldn't be her, not I--mayhap\nshe's some other ruined Delly, run away;--minx!' It was the first time\npoor Bell had ever mixed in such a general crowded company; and knowing\nlittle or nothing of such things, I had thought, that the meeting being\nfor charity's sweet sake, uncharity could find no harbor there; but no\ndoubt it was mere thoughtlessness, not malice in them. Still, it made my\nheart ache in me sadly; for then I very keenly felt the dread\nsuspiciousness, in which a strange and lonely grief invests itself to\ncommon eyes; as if grief itself were not enough, nor innocence any armor\nto us, but despite must also come, and icy infamy! Miserable returnings\nthen I had--even in the midst of bright-budding girls and full-blown\nwomen--miserable returnings then I had of the feeling, the bewildering\nfeeling of the inhumanities I spoke of in my earlier story. But Pierre,\nblessed Pierre, do not look so sadly and half-reproachfully upon me.\nLone and lost though I have been, I love my kind; and charitably and\nintelligently pity them, who uncharitably and unintelligently do me\ndespite. And thou, _thou_, blessed brother, hath glorified many somber\nplaces in my soul, and taught me once for all to know, that my kind are\ncapable of things which would be glorious in angels. So look away from\nme, dear Pierre, till thou hast taught thine eyes more wonted glances.\"\n\n\"They are vile falsifying telegraphs of me, then, sweet Isabel. What my\nlook was I can not tell, but my heart was only dark with ill-restrained\nupbraidings against heaven that could unrelentingly see such innocence\nas thine so suffer. Go on with thy too-touching tale.\"\n\n\"Quietly I sat there sewing, not brave enough to look up at all, and\nthanking my good star, that had led me to so concealed a nook behind the\nrest: quietly I sat there, sewing on a flannel shirt, and with each\nstitch praying God, that whatever heart it might be folded over, the\nflannel might hold it truly warm; and keep out the wide-world-coldness\nwhich I felt myself; and which no flannel, or thickest fur, or any fire\nthen could keep off from me; quietly I sat there sewing, when I heard\nthe announcing words--oh, how deep and ineffaceably engraved they\nare!--'Ah, dames, dames, Madame Glendinning,--Master Pierre\nGlendinning.' Instantly, my sharp needle went through my side and\nstitched my heart; the flannel dropt from my hand; thou heard'st my\nshriek. But the good people bore me still nearer to the casement close\nat hand, and threw it open wide; and God's own breath breathed on me;\nand I rallied; and said it was some merest passing fit--'twas quite over\nnow--I was used to it--they had my heart's best thanks--but would they\nnow only leave me to myself, it were best for me;--I would go on and\nsew. And thus it came and passed away; and again I sat sewing on the\nflannel, hoping either that the unanticipated persons would soon depart,\nor else that some spirit would catch me away from there; I sat sewing\non--till, Pierre! Pierre!--without looking up--for that I dared not do\nat any time that evening--only once--without looking up, or knowing\naught but the flannel on my knee, and the needle in my heart, I\nfelt,--Pierre, _felt_--a glance of magnetic meaning on me. Long, I,\nshrinking, sideways turned to meet it, but could not; till some helping\nspirit seized me, and all my soul looked up at thee in my full-fronting\nface. It was enough. Fate was in that moment. All the loneliness of my\nlife, all the choked longings of my soul, now poured over me. I could\nnot away from them. Then first I felt the complete deplorableness of my\nstate; that while thou, my brother, had a mother, and troops of aunts\nand cousins, and plentiful friends in city and in country--I, I, Isabel,\nthy own father's daughter, was thrust out of all hearts' gates, and\nshivered in the winter way. But this was but the least. Not poor Bell\ncan tell thee all the feelings of poor Bell, or what feelings she felt\nfirst. It was all one whirl of old and new bewilderings, mixed and\nslanted with a driving madness. But it was most the sweet, inquisitive,\nkindly interested aspect of thy face,--so strangely like thy father's,\ntoo--the one only being that I first did love--it was that which most\nstirred the distracting storm in me; most charged me with the immense\nlongings for some one of my blood to know me, and to own me, though but\nonce, and then away. Oh, my dear brother--Pierre! Pierre!--could'st thou\ntake out my heart, and look at it in thy hand, then thou would'st find\nit all over written, this way and that, and crossed again, and yet\nagain, with continual lines of longings, that found no end but in\nsuddenly calling thee. Call him! Call him! He will come!--so cried my\nheart to me; so cried the leaves and stars to me, as I that night went\nhome. But pride rose up--the very pride in my own longings,--and as one\narm pulled, the other held. So I stood still, and called thee not. But\nFate will be Fate, and it was fated. Once having met thy fixed regardful\nglance; once having seen the full angelicalness in thee, my whole soul\nwas undone by thee; my whole pride was cut off at the root, and soon\nshowed a blighting in the bud; which spread deep into my whole being,\ntill I knew, that utterly decay and die away I must, unless pride let me\ngo, and I, with the one little trumpet of a pen, blew my heart's\nshrillest blast, and called dear Pierre to me. My soul was full; and as\nmy beseeching ink went tracing o'er the page, my tears contributed their\nmite, and made a strange alloy. How blest I felt that my so bitterly\ntear-mingled ink--that last depth of my anguish--would never be visibly\nknown to thee, but the tears would dry upon the page, and all be fair\nagain, ere the so submerged-freighted letter should meet thine eye.\n\n\"Ah, there thou wast deceived, poor Isabel,\" cried Pierre impulsively;\n\"thy tears dried not fair, but dried red, almost like blood; and nothing\nso much moved my inmost soul as that tragic sight.\"\n\n\"How? how? Pierre, my brother? Dried they red? Oh, horrible!\nenchantment! most undreamed of!\"\n\n\"Nay, the ink--the ink! something chemic in it changed thy real tears to\nseeming blood;--only that, my sister.\"\n\n\"Oh Pierre! thus wonderfully is it--seems to me--that our own hearts do\nnot ever know the extremity of their own sufferings; sometimes we bleed\nblood, when we think it only water. Of our sufferings, as of our\ntalents, others sometimes are the better judges. But stop me! force me\nbackward to my story! Yet methinks that now thou knowest all;--no, not\nentirely all. Thou dost not know what planned and winnowed motive I did\nhave in writing thee; nor does poor Bell know that; for poor Bell was\ntoo delirious to have planned and winnowed motives then. The impulse in\nme called thee, not poor Bell. God called thee, Pierre, not poor Bell.\nEven now, when I have passed one night after seeing thee, and hearkening\nto all thy full love and graciousness; even now, I stand as one amazed,\nand feel not what may be coming to me, or what will now befall me, from\nhaving so rashly claimed thee for mine. Pierre, now, _now_, this instant\na vague anguish fills me. Tell me, by loving me, by owning me, publicly\nor secretly,--tell me, doth it involve any vital hurt to thee? Speak\nwithout reserve; speak honestly; as I do to thee! Speak now, Pierre, and\ntell me all!\"\n\n\"Is Love a harm? Can Truth betray to pain? Sweet Isabel, how can hurt\ncome in the path to God? Now, when I know thee all, now did I forget\nthee, fail to acknowledge thee, and love thee before the wide world's\nwhole brazen width--could I do that; then might'st thou ask thy question\nreasonably and say--Tell me, Pierre, does not the suffocating in thee of\npoor Bell's holy claims, does not that involve for thee unending misery?\nAnd my truthful soul would echo--Unending misery! Nay, nay, nay. Thou\nart my sister and I am thy brother; and that part of the world which\nknows me, shall acknowledge thee; or by heaven I will crush the\ndisdainful world down on its knees to thee, my sweet Isabel!\"\n\n\"The menacings in thy eyes are dear delights to me; I grow up with thy\nown glorious stature; and in thee, my brother, I see God's indignant\nembassador to me, saying--Up, up, Isabel, and take no terms from the\ncommon world, but do thou make terms to it, and grind thy fierce rights\nout of it! Thy catching nobleness unsexes me, my brother; and now I know\nthat in her most exalted moment, then woman no more feels the twin-born\nsoftness of her breasts, but feels chain-armor palpitating there!\"\n\nHer changed attitude of beautiful audacity; her long scornful hair, that\ntrailed out a disheveled banner; her wonderful transfigured eyes, in\nwhich some meteors seemed playing up; all this now seemed to Pierre the\nwork of an invisible enchanter. Transformed she stood before him; and\nPierre, bowing low over to her, owned that irrespective, darting majesty\nof humanity, which can be majestical and menacing in woman as in man.\n\nBut her gentler sex returned to Isabel at last; and she sat silent in\nthe casement's niche, looking out upon the soft ground-lightnings of the\nelectric summer night.\n\n\nVI.\n\nSadly smiling, Pierre broke the pause.\n\n\"My sister, thou art so rich, that thou must do me alms; I am very\nhungry; I have forgotten to eat since breakfast;--and now thou shalt\nbring me bread and a cup of water, Isabel, ere I go forth from thee.\nLast night I went rummaging in a pantry, like a bake-house burglar; but\nto-night thou and I must sup together, Isabel; for as we may henceforth\nlive together, let us begin forthwith to eat in company.\"\n\nIsabel looked up at him, with sudden and deep emotion, then all\nacquiescing sweetness, and silently left the room.\n\nAs she returned, Pierre, casting his eyes toward the ceiling, said--\"She\nis quiet now, the pacing hath entirely ceased.\"\n\n\"Not the beating, tho'; her foot hath paused, not her unceasing heart.\nMy brother, she is not quiet now; quiet for her hath gone; so that the\npivoted stillness of this night is yet a noisy madness to her.\"\n\n\"Give me pen or pencil, and some paper, Isabel.\"\n\nShe laid down her loaf, and plate, and knife, and brought him pen, and\nink, and paper.\n\nPierre took the pen.\n\n\"Was this the one, dear Isabel?\"\n\n\"It is the one, my brother; none other is in this poor cot.\"\n\nHe gazed at it intensely. Then turning to the table, steadily wrote the\nfollowing note:\n\n     \"For Delly Ulver: with the deep and true regard and sympathy of\n     Pierre Glendinning.\n\n     \"Thy sad story--partly known before--hath now more fully come to\n     me, from one who sincerely feels for thee, and who hath imparted\n     her own sincerity to me. Thou desirest to quit this neighborhood,\n     and be somewhere at peace, and find some secluded employ fitted to\n     thy sex and age. With this, I now willingly charge myself, and\n     insure it to thee, so far as my utmost ability can go.\n     Therefore--if consolation be not wholly spurned by thy great grief,\n     which too often happens, though it be but grief's great folly so to\n     feel--therefore, two true friends of thine do here beseech thee to\n     take some little heart to thee, and bethink thee, that all thy life\n     is not yet lived; that Time hath surest healing in his continuous\n     balm. Be patient yet a little while, till thy future lot be\n     disposed for thee, through our best help; and so, know me and\n     Isabel thy earnest friends and true-hearted lovers.\"\n\nHe handed the note to Isabel. She read it silently, and put it down, and\nspread her two hands over him, and with one motion lifted her eyes\ntoward Delly and toward God.\n\n\"Thou think'st it will not pain her to receive the note, Isabel? Thou\nknow'st best. I thought, that ere our help do really reach her, some\npromise of it now might prove slight comfort. But keep it, and do as\nthou think'st best.\"\n\n\"Then straightway will I give it her, my brother,\" said Isabel, quitting\nhim.\n\nAn infixing stillness, now thrust a long rivet through the night, and\nfast nailed it to that side of the world. And alone again in such an\nhour, Pierre could not but listen. He heard Isabel's step on the stair;\nthen it approached him from above; then he heard a gentle knock, and\nthought he heard a rustling, as of paper slid over a threshold\nunderneath a door. Then another advancing and opposite step tremblingly\nmet Isabel's; and then both steps stepped from each other, and soon\nIsabel came back to him.\n\n\"Thou did'st knock, and slide it underneath the door?\"\n\n\"Yes, and she hath it now. Hark! a sobbing! Thank God, long arid grief\nhath found a tear at last. Pity, sympathy hath done this.--Pierre, for\nthy dear deed thou art already sainted, ere thou be dead.\"\n\n\"Do saints hunger, Isabel?\" said Pierre, striving to call her away from\nthis. \"Come, give me the loaf; but no, thou shalt help me, my\nsister.--Thank thee;--this is twice over the bread of sweetness.--Is\nthis of thine own making, Isabel?\"\n\n\"My own making, my brother.\"\n\n\"Give me the cup; hand it me with thine own hand. So:--Isabel, my heart\nand soul are now full of deepest reverence; yet I do dare to call this\nthe real sacrament of the supper.--Eat with me.\"\n\nThey eat together without a single word; and without a single word,\nPierre rose, and kissed her pure and spotless brow, and without a single\nword departed from the place.\n\n\nVII.\n\nWe know not Pierre Glendinning's thoughts as he gained the village and\npassed on beneath its often shrouding trees, and saw no light from man,\nand heard no sound from man, but only, by intervals, saw at his feet the\nsoft ground-lightnings, snake-like, playing in and out among the blades\nof grass; and between the trees, caught the far dim light from heaven,\nand heard the far wide general hum of the sleeping but still breathing\nearth.\n\nHe paused before a detached and pleasant house, with much shrubbery\nabout it. He mounted the portico and knocked distinctly there, just as\nthe village clock struck one. He knocked, but no answer came. He knocked\nagain, and soon he heard a sash thrown up in the second story, and an\nastonished voice inquired who was there?\n\n\"It is Pierre Glendinning, and he desires an instant interview with the\nReverend Mr. Falsgrave.\"\n\n\"Do I hear right?--in heaven's name, what is the matter, young\ngentleman?\"\n\n\"Every thing is the matter; the whole world is the matter. Will you\nadmit me, sir?\"\n\n\"Certainly--but I beseech thee--nay, stay, I will admit thee.\"\n\nIn quicker time than could have been anticipated, the door was opened to\nPierre by Mr. Falsgrave in person, holding a candle, and invested in his\nvery becoming student's wrapper of Scotch plaid.\n\n\"For heaven's sake, what is the matter, Mr. Glendinning?\"\n\n\"Heaven and earth is the matter, sir! shall we go up to the study?\"\n\n\"Certainly, but--but--\"\n\n\"Well, let us proceed, then.\"\n\nThey went up-stairs, and soon found themselves in the clergyman's\nretreat, and both sat down; the amazed host still holding the candle in\nhis hand, and intently eying Pierre, with an apprehensive aspect.\n\n\"Thou art a man of God, sir, I believe.\"\n\n\"I? I? I? upon my word, Mr. Glendinning!\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, the world calls thee a man of God. Now, what hast thou, the\nman of God, decided, with my mother, concerning Delly Ulver?\"\n\n\"Delly Ulver! why, why--what can this madness mean?\"\n\n\"It means, sir, what have thou and my mother decided concerning Delly\nUlver.\"\n\n\"She?--Delly Ulver? She is to depart the neighborhood; why, her own\nparents want her not.\"\n\n\"_How_ is she to depart? _Who_ is to take her? Art _thou_ to take her?\n_Where_ is she to go? _Who_ has food for her? _What_ is to keep her from\nthe pollution to which such as she are every day driven to contribute,\nby the detestable uncharitableness and heartlessness of the world?\"\n\n\"Mr. Glendinning,\" said the clergyman, now somewhat calmly putting down\nthe candle, and folding himself with dignity in his gown; \"Mr.\nGlendinning, I will not now make any mention of my natural astonishment\nat this most unusual call, and the most extraordinary time of it. Thou\nhast sought information upon a certain point, and I have given it to\nthee, to the best of my knowledge. All thy after and incidental\nquestions, I choose to have no answer for. I will be most happy to see\nthee at any other time, but for the present thou must excuse my\npresence. Good-night, sir.\"\n\nBut Pierre sat entirely still, and the clergyman could not but remain\nstanding still.\n\n\"I perfectly comprehend the whole, sir. Delly Ulver, then, is to be\ndriven out to starve or rot; and this, too, by the acquiescence of a man\nof God. Mr. Falsgrave, the subject of Delly, deeply interesting as it is\nto me, is only the preface to another, still more interesting to me, and\nconcerning which I once cherished some slight hope that thou wouldst\nhave been able, in thy Christian character, to sincerely and honestly\ncounsel me. But a hint from heaven assures me now, that thou hast no\nearnest and world-disdaining counsel for me. I must seek it direct from\nGod himself, whom, I now know, never delegates his holiest admonishings.\nBut I do not blame thee; I think I begin to see how thy profession is\nunavoidably entangled by all fleshly alliances, and can not move with\ngodly freedom in a world of benefices. I am more sorry than indignant.\nPardon me for my most uncivil call, and know me as not thy enemy.\nGood-night, sir.\"\n\n\n\n\nBOOK IX.\n\nMORE LIGHT, AND THE GLOOM OF THAT LIGHT. MORE GLOOM, AND THE LIGHT OF\nTHAT GLOOM.\n\n\nI.\n\nIn those Hyperborean regions, to which enthusiastic Truth, and\nEarnestness, and Independence, will invariably lead a mind fitted by\nnature for profound and fearless thought, all objects are seen in a\ndubious, uncertain, and refracting light. Viewed through that rarefied\natmosphere the most immemorially admitted maxims of men begin to slide\nand fluctuate, and finally become wholly inverted; the very heavens\nthemselves being not innocent of producing this confounding effect,\nsince it is mostly in the heavens themselves that these wonderful\nmirages are exhibited.\n\nBut the example of many minds forever lost, like undiscoverable Arctic\nexplorers, amid those treacherous regions, warns us entirely away from\nthem; and we learn that it is not for man to follow the trail of truth\ntoo far, since by so doing he entirely loses the directing compass of\nhis mind; for arrived at the Pole, to whose barrenness only it points,\nthere, the needle indifferently respects all points of the horizon\nalike.\n\nBut even the less distant regions of thought are not without their\nsingular introversions. Hardly any sincere man of ordinary reflective\npowers, and accustomed to exercise them at all, but must have been\nindependently struck by the thought, that, after all, what is so\nenthusiastically applauded as the march of mind,--meaning the inroads of\nTruth into Error--which has ever been regarded by hopeful persons as the\none fundamental thing most earnestly to be prayed for as the greatest\npossible Catholic blessing to the world;--almost every thinking man must\nhave been some time or other struck with the idea, that, in certain\nrespects, a tremendous mistake may be lurking here, since all the world\ndoes never gregariously advance to Truth, but only here and there some\nof its individuals do; and by advancing, leave the rest behind; cutting\nthemselves forever adrift from their sympathy, and making themselves\nalways liable to be regarded with distrust, dislike, and often,\ndownright--though, ofttimes, concealed--fear and hate. What wonder,\nthen, that those advanced minds, which in spite of advance, happen still\nto remain, for the time, ill-regulated, should now and then be goaded\ninto turning round in acts of wanton aggression upon sentiments and\nopinions now forever left in their rear. Certain it is, that in their\nearlier stages of advance, especially in youthful minds, as yet\nuntranquilized by long habituation to the world as it inevitably and\neternally is; this aggressiveness is almost invariably manifested, and\nas invariably afterward deplored by themselves.\n\nThat amazing shock of practical truth, which in the compass of a very\nfew days and hours had not so much advanced, as magically transplanted\nthe youthful mind of Pierre far beyond all common discernments; it had\nnot been entirely unattended by the lamentable rearward aggressiveness\nwe have endeavored to portray above. Yielding to that unwarrantable\nmood, he had invaded the profound midnight slumbers of the Reverend Mr.\nFalsgrave, and most discourteously made war upon that really amiable and\nestimable person. But as through the strange force of circumstances his\nadvance in insight had been so surprisingly rapid, so also was now his\nadvance in some sort of wisdom, in charitableness; and his concluding\nwords to Mr. Falsgrave, sufficiently evinced that already, ere quitting\nthat gentleman's study, he had begun to repent his ever entering it on\nsuch a mission.\n\nAnd as he now walked on in the profound meditations induced by the hour;\nand as all that was in him stirred to and fro, intensely agitated by the\never-creative fire of enthusiastic earnestness, he became fully alive to\nmany palliating considerations, which had they previously occurred to\nhim would have peremptorily forbidden his impulsive intrusion upon the\nrespectable clergyman.\n\nBut it is through the malice of this earthly air, that only by being\nguilty of Folly does mortal man in many cases arrive at the perception\nof Sense. A thought which should forever free us from hasty imprecations\nupon our ever-recurring intervals of Folly; since though Folly be our\nteacher, Sense is the lesson she teaches; since if Folly wholly depart\nfrom us, Further Sense will be her companion in the flight, and we will\nbe left standing midway in wisdom. For it is only the miraculous vanity\nof man which ever persuades him, that even for the most richly gifted\nmind, there ever arrives an earthly period, where it can truly say to\nitself, I have come to the Ultimate of Human Speculative Knowledge;\nhereafter, at this present point I will abide. Sudden onsets of new\ntruth will assail him, and over-turn him as the Tartars did China; for\nthere is no China Wall that man can build in his soul, which shall\npermanently stay the irruptions of those barbarous hordes which Truth\never nourishes in the loins of her frozen, yet teeming North; so that\nthe Empire of Human Knowledge can never be lasting in any one dynasty,\nsince Truth still gives new Emperors to the earth.\n\nBut the thoughts we here indite as Pierre's are to be very carefully\ndiscriminated from those we indite concerning him. Ignorant at this time\nof the ideas concerning the reciprocity and partnership of Folly and\nSense, in contributing to the mental and moral growth of the mind;\nPierre keenly upbraided his thoughtlessness, and began to stagger in his\nsoul; as distrustful of that radical change in his general sentiments,\nwhich had thus hurried him into a glaring impropriety and folly; as\ndistrustful of himself, the most wretched distrust of all. But this last\ndistrust was not of the heart; for heaven itself, so he felt, had\nsanctified that with its blessing; but it was the distrust of his\nintellect, which in undisciplinedly espousing the manly enthusiast cause\nof his heart, seemed to cast a reproach upon that cause itself.\n\nBut though evermore hath the earnest heart an eventual balm for the most\ndeplorable error of the head; yet in the interval small alleviation is\nto be had, and the whole man droops into nameless melancholy. Then it\nseems as though the most magnanimous and virtuous resolutions were only\nintended for fine spiritual emotions, not as mere preludes to their\nbodily translation into acts; since in essaying their embodiment, we\nhave but proved ourselves miserable bunglers, and thereupon taken\nignominious shame to ourselves. Then, too, the never-entirely repulsed\nhosts of Commonness, and Conventionalness, and Worldly\nPrudent-mindedness return to the charge; press hard on the faltering\nsoul; and with inhuman hootings deride all its nobleness as mere\neccentricity, which further wisdom and experience shall assuredly cure.\nThe man is as seized by arms and legs, and convulsively pulled either\nway by his own indecisions and doubts. Blackness advances her banner\nover this cruel altercation, and he droops and swoons beneath its folds.\n\nIt was precisely in this mood of mind that, at about two in the morning,\nPierre, with a hanging head, now crossed the private threshold of the\nMansion of Saddle Meadows.\n\n\nII.\n\nIn the profoundly silent heart of a house full of sleeping serving-men\nand maids, Pierre now sat in his chamber before his accustomed round\ntable, still tossed with the books and the papers which, three days\nbefore, he had abruptly left, for a sudden and more absorbing object.\nUppermost and most conspicuous among the books were the Inferno of\nDante, and the Hamlet of Shakspeare.\n\nHis mind was wandering and vague; his arm wandered and was vague. Soon\nhe found the open Inferno in his hand, and his eye met the following\nlines, allegorically overscribed within the arch of the outgoings of the\nwomb of human life:\n\n    \"Through me you pass into the city of Woe;\n     Through me you pass into eternal pain;\n     Through me, among the people lost for aye.\n\n           *       *       *       *       *\n\n     All hope abandon, ye who enter here.\"\n\nHe dropped the fatal volume from his hand; he dropped his fated head\nupon his chest.\n\nHis mind was wandering and vague; his arm wandered and was vague. Some\nmoments passed, and he found the open Hamlet in his hand, and his eyes\nmet the following lines:\n\n    \"The time is out of joint;--Oh cursed spite,\n     That ever I was born to set it right!\"\n\nHe dropped the too true volume from his hand; his petrifying heart\ndropped hollowly within him, as a pebble down Carrisbrook well.\n\n\nIII.\n\nThe man Dante Alighieri received unforgivable affronts and insults from\nthe world; and the poet Dante Alighieri bequeathed his immortal curse to\nit, in the sublime malediction of the Inferno. The fiery tongue whose\npolitical forkings lost him the solacements of this world, found its\nmalicious counterpart in that muse of fire, which would forever bar the\nvast bulk of mankind from all solacement in the worlds to come.\nFortunately for the felicity of the Dilletante in Literature, the\nhorrible allegorical meanings of the Inferno, lie not on the surface;\nbut unfortunately for the earnest and youthful piercers into truth and\nreality, those horrible meanings, when first discovered, infuse their\npoison into a spot previously unprovided with that sovereign antidote of\na sense of uncapitulatable security, which is only the possession of the\nfurthest advanced and profoundest souls.\n\nJudge ye, then, ye Judicious, the mood of Pierre, so far as the passage\nin Dante touched him.\n\nIf among the deeper significances of its pervading indefiniteness, which\nsignificances are wisely hidden from all but the rarest adepts, the\npregnant tragedy of Hamlet convey any one particular moral at all fitted\nto the ordinary uses of man, it is this:--that all meditation is\nworthless, unless it prompt to action; that it is not for man to stand\nshilly-shallying amid the conflicting invasions of surrounding impulses;\nthat in the earliest instant of conviction, the roused man must strike,\nand, if possible, with the precision and the force of the\nlightning-bolt.\n\nPierre had always been an admiring reader of Hamlet; but neither his age\nnor his mental experience thus far, had qualified him either to catch\ninitiating glimpses into the hopeless gloom of its interior meaning, or\nto draw from the general story those superficial and purely incidental\nlessons, wherein the painstaking moralist so complacently expatiates.\n\nThe intensest light of reason and revelation combined, can not shed such\nblazonings upon the deeper truths in man, as will sometimes proceed from\nhis own profoundest gloom. Utter darkness is then his light, and\ncat-like he distinctly sees all objects through a medium which is mere\nblindness to common vision. Wherefore have Gloom and Grief been\ncelebrated of old as the selectest chamberlains to knowledge? Wherefore\nis it, that not to know Gloom and Grief is not to know aught that an\nheroic man should learn?\n\nBy the light of that gloom, Pierre now turned over the soul of Hamlet in\nhis hand. He knew not--at least, felt not--then, that Hamlet, though a\nthing of life, was, after all, but a thing of breath, evoked by the\nwanton magic of a creative hand, and as wantonly dismissed at last into\nendless halls of hell and night.\n\nIt is the not impartially bestowed privilege of the more final insights,\nthat at the same moment they reveal the depths, they do, sometimes, also\nreveal--though by no means so distinctly--some answering heights. But\nwhen only midway down the gulf, its crags wholly conceal the upper\nvaults, and the wanderer thinks it all one gulf of downward dark.\n\nJudge ye, then, ye Judicious, the mood of Pierre, so far as the passage\nin Hamlet touched him.\n\n\nIV.\n\nTorn into a hundred shreds the printed pages of Hell and Hamlet lay at\nhis feet, which trampled them, while their vacant covers mocked him with\ntheir idle titles. Dante had made him fierce, and Hamlet had insinuated\nthat there was none to strike. Dante had taught him that he had bitter\ncause of quarrel; Hamlet taunted him with faltering in the fight. Now he\nbegan to curse anew his fate, for now he began to see that after all he\nhad been finely juggling with himself, and postponing with himself, and\nin meditative sentimentalities wasting the moments consecrated to\ninstant action.\n\nEight-and-forty hours and more had passed. Was Isabel acknowledged? Had\nshe yet hung on his public arm? Who knew yet of Isabel but Pierre? Like\na skulking coward he had gone prowling in the woods by day, and like a\nskulking coward he had stolen to her haunt by night! Like a thief he had\nsat and stammered and turned pale before his mother, and in the cause of\nHoly Right, permitted a woman to grow tall and hector over him! Ah! Easy\nfor man to think like a hero; but hard for man to act like one. All\nimaginable audacities readily enter into the soul; few come boldly forth\nfrom it.\n\nDid he, or did he not vitally mean to do this thing? Was the immense\nstuff to do it his, or was it not his? Why defer? Why put off? What was\nthere to be gained by deferring and putting off? His resolution had been\ntaken, why was it not executed? What more was there to learn? What more\nwhich was essential to the public acknowledgment of Isabel, had remained\nto be learned, after his first glance at her first letter? Had doubts of\nher identity come over him to stay him?--None at all. Against the wall\nof the thick darkness of the mystery of Isabel, recorded as by some\nphosphoric finger was the burning fact, that Isabel was his sister. Why\nthen? How then? Whence then this utter nothing of his acts? Did he\nstagger at the thought, that at the first announcement to his mother\nconcerning Isabel, and his resolution to own her boldly and lovingly,\nhis proud mother, spurning the reflection on his father, would likewise\nspurn Pierre and Isabel, and denounce both him and her, and hate them\nboth alike, as unnatural accomplices against the good name of the purest\nof husbands and parents? Not at all. Such a thought was not in him. For\nhad he not already resolved, that his mother should know nothing of the\nfact of Isabel?--But how now? What then? How was Isabel to be\nacknowledged to the world, if his mother was to know nothing of that\nacknowledgment?--Short-sighted, miserable palterer and huckster, thou\nhast been playing a most fond and foolish game with thyself! Fool and\ncoward! Coward and fool! Tear thyself open, and read there the\nconfounding story of thy blind dotishness! Thy two grand\nresolutions--the public acknowledgment of Isabel, and the charitable\nwithholding of her existence from thy own mother,--these are impossible\nadjuncts.--Likewise, thy so magnanimous purpose to screen thy father's\nhonorable memory from reproach, and thy other intention, the open\nvindication of thy fraternalness to Isabel,--these also are impossible\nadjuncts. And the having individually entertained four such resolves,\nwithout perceiving that once brought together, they all mutually expire;\nthis, this ineffable folly, Pierre, brands thee in the forehead for an\nunaccountable infatuate!\n\nWell may'st thou distrust thyself, and curse thyself, and tear thy\nHamlet and thy Hell! Oh! fool, blind fool, and a million times an ass!\nGo, go, thou poor and feeble one! High deeds are not for such blind\ngrubs as thou! Quit Isabel, and go to Lucy! Beg humble pardon of thy\nmother, and hereafter be a more obedient and good boy to her,\nPierre--Pierre, Pierre,--infatuate!\n\nImpossible would it be now to tell all the confusion and confoundings in\nthe soul of Pierre, so soon as the above absurdities in his mind\npresented themselves first to his combining consciousness. He would fain\nhave disowned the very memory and the mind which produced to him such an\nimmense scandal upon his common sanity. Now indeed did all the fiery\nfloods in the Inferno, and all the rolling gloom in Hamlet suffocate him\nat once in flame and smoke. The cheeks of his soul collapsed in him: he\ndashed himself in blind fury and swift madness against the wall, and\nfell dabbling in the vomit of his loathed identity.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK X.\n\nTHE UNPRECEDENTED FINAL RESOLUTION OF PIERRE.\n\n\nI.\n\nGlorified be his gracious memory who first said, The deepest gloom\nprecedes the day. We care not whether the saying will prove true to the\nutmost bounds of things; sufficient that it sometimes does hold true\nwithin the bounds of earthly finitude.\n\nNext morning Pierre rose from the floor of his chamber, haggard and\ntattered in body from his past night's utter misery, but stoically\nserene and symmetrical in soul, with the foretaste of what then seemed\nto him a planned and perfect Future. Now he thinks he knows that the\nwholly unanticipated storm which had so terribly burst upon him, had yet\nburst upon him for his good; for the place, which in its undetected\nincipiency, the storm had obscurely occupied in his soul, seemed now\nclear sky to him; and all his horizon seemed distinctly commanded by\nhim.\n\nHis resolution was a strange and extraordinary one; but therefore it\nonly the better met a strange and extraordinary emergency. But it was\nnot only strange and extraordinary in its novelty of mere aspect, but it\nwas wonderful in its unequaled renunciation of himself.\n\nFrom the first, determined at all hazards to hold his father's fair\nfame inviolate from any thing he should do in reference to protecting\nIsabel, and extending to her a brother's utmost devotedness and love;\nand equally determined not to shake his mother's lasting peace by any\nuseless exposure of unwelcome facts; and yet vowed in his deepest soul\nsome way to embrace Isabel before the world, and yield to her his\nconstant consolation and companionship; and finding no possible mode of\nunitedly compassing all these ends, without a most singular act of pious\nimposture, which he thought all heaven would justify in him, since he\nhimself was to be the grand self-renouncing victim; therefore, this was\nhis settled and immovable purpose now; namely: to assume before the\nworld, that by secret rites, Pierre Glendinning was already become the\nhusband of Isabel Banford--an assumption which would entirely warrant\nhis dwelling in her continual company, and upon equal terms, taking her\nwherever the world admitted him; and at the same time foreclose all\nsinister inquisitions bearing upon his deceased parent's memory, or any\nway affecting his mother's lasting peace, as indissolubly linked with\nthat. True, he in embryo, foreknew, that the extraordinary thing he had\nresolved, would, in another way, indirectly though inevitably, dart a\nmost keen pang into his mother's heart; but this then seemed to him part\nof the unavoidable vast price of his enthusiastic virtue; and, thus\nminded, rather would he privately pain his living mother with a wound\nthat might be curable, than cast world-wide and irremediable\ndishonor--so it seemed to him--upon his departed father.\n\nProbably no other being than Isabel could have produced upon Pierre\nimpressions powerful enough to eventuate in a final resolution so\nunparalleled as the above. But the wonderful melodiousness of her grief\nhad touched the secret monochord within his breast, by an apparent\nmagic, precisely similar to that which had moved the stringed tongue of\nher guitar to respond to the heart-strings of her own melancholy\nplaints. The deep voice of the being of Isabel called to him from out\nthe immense distances of sky and air, and there seemed no veto of the\nearth that could forbid her heavenly claim.\n\nDuring the three days that he had personally known her, and so been\nbrought into magnetic contact with her, other persuasions and potencies\nthan those direct ones, involved in her bewildering eyes and marvelous\nstory, had unconsciously left their ineffaceable impressions on him, and\nperhaps without his privity, had mainly contributed to his resolve. She\nhad impressed him as the glorious child of Pride and Grief, in whose\ncountenance were traceable the divinest lineaments of both her parents.\nPride gave to her her nameless nobleness; Grief touched that nobleness\nwith an angelical softness; and again that softness was steeped in a\nmost charitable humility, which was the foundation of her loftiest\nexcellence of all.\n\nNeither by word or letter had Isabel betrayed any spark of those more\ncommon emotions and desires which might not unreasonably be ascribed to\nan ordinary person placed in circumstances like hers. Though almost\npenniless, she had not invoked the pecuniary bounty of Pierre; and\nthough she was altogether silent on that subject, yet Pierre could not\nbut be strangely sensible of something in her which disdained to\nvoluntarily hang upon the mere bounty even of a brother. Nor, though she\nby various nameless ways, manifested her consciousness of being\nsurrounded by uncongenial and inferior beings, while yet descended from\na generous stock, and personally meriting the most refined\ncompanionships which the wide world could yield; nevertheless, she had\nnot demanded of Pierre that he should array her in brocade, and lead her\nforth among the rare and opulent ladies of the land. But while thus\nevincing her intuitive, true lady-likeness and nobleness by this entire\nfreedom from all sordid motives, neither had she merged all her feelings\nin any sickly sentimentalities of sisterly affection toward her so\nsuddenly discovered brother; which, in the case of a naturally\nunattractive woman in her circumstances, would not have been altogether\nalluring to Pierre. No. That intense and indescribable longing, which\nher letter by its very incoherencies had best embodied, proceeded from\nno base, vain, or ordinary motive whatever; but was the unsuppressible\nand unmistakable cry of the godhead through her soul, commanding Pierre\nto fly to her, and do his highest and most glorious duty in the world.\n\nNor now, as it changedly seemed to Pierre, did that duty consist in\nstubbornly flying in the marble face of the Past, and striving to\nreverse the decree which had pronounced that Isabel could never\nperfectly inherit all the privileges of a legitimate child of her\nfather. And thoroughly now he felt, that even as this would in the\npresent case be both preposterous in itself and cruel in effect to both\nthe living and the dead, so was it entirely undesired by Isabel, who\nthough once yielding to a momentary burst of aggressive enthusiasm, yet\nin her more wonted mood of mournfulness and sweetness, evinced no such\nlawless wandering. Thoroughly, now he felt, that Isabel was content to\nlive obscure in her paternal identity, so long as she could any way\nappease her deep longings for the constant love and sympathy and close\ndomestic contact of some one of her blood. So that Pierre had no\nslightest misgiving that upon learning the character of his scheme, she\nwould deem it to come short of her natural expectations; while so far as\nits apparent strangeness was concerned,--a strangeness, perhaps\ninvincible to squeamish and humdrum women--here Pierre anticipated no\nobstacle in Isabel; for her whole past was strange, and strangeness\nseemed best befitting to her future.\n\nBut had Pierre now reread the opening paragraph of her letter to him, he\nmight have very quickly derived a powerful anticipative objection from\nhis sister, which his own complete disinterestedness concealed from him.\nThough Pierre had every reason to believe that--owing to her secluded\nand humble life--Isabel was in entire ignorance of the fact of his\nprecise relation to Lucy Tartan:--an ignorance, whose first indirect and\nunconscious manifestation in Isabel, had been unspeakably welcome to\nhim;--and though, of course, he had both wisely and benevolently\nabstained from enlightening her on that point; still, notwithstanding\nthis, was it possible that any true-hearted noble girl like Isabel,\nwould, to benefit herself, willingly become a participator in an act,\nwhich would prospectively and forever bar the blessed boon of\nmarriageable love from one so young and generous as Pierre, and\neternally entangle him in a fictitious alliance, which, though in\nreality but a web of air, yet in effect would prove a wall of iron; for\nthe same powerful motive which induced the thought of forming such an\nalliance, would always thereafter forbid that tacit exposure of its\nfictitiousness, which would be consequent upon its public\ndiscontinuance, and the real nuptials of Pierre with any other being\nduring the lifetime of Isabel.\n\nBut according to what view you take of it, it is either the gracious or\nthe malicious gift of the great gods to man, that on the threshold of\nany wholly new and momentous devoted enterprise, the thousand ulterior\nintricacies and emperilings to which it must conduct; these, at the\noutset, are mostly withheld from sight; and so, through her\never-primeval wilderness Fortune's Knight rides on, alike ignorant of\nthe palaces or the pitfalls in its heart. Surprising, and past all\nordinary belief, are those strange oversights and inconsistencies, into\nwhich the enthusiastic meditation upon unique or extreme resolves will\nsometimes beget in young and over-ardent souls. That all-comprehending\noneness, that calm representativeness, by which a steady philosophic\nmind reaches forth and draws to itself, in their collective entirety,\nthe objects of its contemplations; that pertains not to the young\nenthusiast. By his eagerness, all objects are deceptively foreshortened;\nby his intensity each object is viewed as detached; so that essentially\nand relatively every thing is misseen by him. Already have we exposed\nthat passing preposterousness in Pierre, which by reason of the\nabove-named cause which we have endeavored to portray, induced him to\ncherish for a time four unitedly impossible designs. And now we behold\nthis hapless youth all eager to involve himself in such an inextricable\ntwist of Fate, that the three dextrous maids themselves could hardly\ndisentangle him, if once he tie the complicating knots about him and\nIsabel.\n\nAh, thou rash boy! are there no couriers in the air to warn thee away\nfrom these emperilings, and point thee to those Cretan labyrinths, to\nwhich thy life's cord is leading thee? Where now are the high\nbeneficences? Whither fled the sweet angels that are alledged guardians\nto man?\n\nNot that the impulsive Pierre wholly overlooked all that was menacing to\nhim in his future, if now he acted out his most rare resolve; but\neagerly foreshortened by him, they assumed not their full magnitude of\nmenacing; nor, indeed,--so riveted now his purpose--were they pushed up\nto his face, would he for that renounce his self-renunciation; while\nconcerning all things more immediately contingent upon his central\nresolution; these were, doubtless, in a measure, foreseen and understood\nby him. Perfectly, at least, he seemed to foresee and understand, that\nthe present hope of Lucy Tartan must be banished from his being; that\nthis would carry a terrible pang to her, which in the natural recoil\nwould but redouble his own; that to the world all his heroicness,\nstanding equally unexplained and unsuspected, therefore the world would\ndenounce him as infamously false to his betrothed; reckless of the most\nbinding human vows; a secret wooer and wedder of an unknown and\nenigmatic girl; a spurner of all a loving mother's wisest counselings; a\nbringer down of lasting reproach upon an honorable name; a besotted\nself-exile from a most prosperous house and bounteous fortune; and\nlastly, that now his whole life would, in the eyes of the wide humanity,\nbe covered with an all-pervading haze of incurable sinisterness,\npossibly not to be removed even in the concluding hour of death.\n\nSuch, oh thou son of man! are the perils and the miseries thou callest\ndown on thee, when, even in a virtuous cause, thou steppest aside from\nthose arbitrary lines of conduct, by which the common world, however\nbase and dastardly, surrounds thee for thy worldly good.\n\nOfttimes it is very wonderful to trace the rarest and profoundest\nthings, and find their probable origin in something extremely trite or\ntrivial. Yet so strange and complicate is the human soul; so much is\nconfusedly evolved from out itself, and such vast and varied accessions\ncome to it from abroad, and so impossible is it always to distinguish\nbetween these two, that the wisest man were rash, positively to assign\nthe precise and incipient origination of his final thoughts and acts.\nFar as we blind moles can see, man's life seems but an acting upon\nmysterious hints; it is somehow hinted to us, to do thus or thus. For\nsurely no mere mortal who has at all gone down into himself will ever\npretend that his slightest thought or act solely originates in his own\ndefined identity. This preamble seems not entirely unnecessary as usher\nof the strange conceit, that possibly the latent germ of Pierre's\nproposed extraordinary mode of executing his proposed extraordinary\nresolve--namely, the nominal conversion of a sister into a wife--might\nhave been found in the previous conversational conversion of a mother\ninto a sister; for hereby he had habituated his voice and manner to a\ncertain fictitiousness in one of the closest domestic relations of life;\nand since man's moral texture is very porous, and things assumed upon\nthe surface, at last strike in--hence, this outward habituation to the\nabove-named fictitiousness had insensibly disposed his mind to it as it\nwere; but only innocently and pleasantly as yet. If, by any possibility,\nthis general conceit be so, then to Pierre the times of sportfulness\nwere as pregnant with the hours of earnestness; and in sport he learnt\nthe terms of woe.\n\n\nII.\n\nIf next to that resolve concerning his lasting fraternal succor to\nIsabel, there was at this present time any determination in Pierre\nabsolutely inflexible, and partaking at once of the sacredness and the\nindissolubleness of the most solemn oath, it was the enthusiastic, and\napparently wholly supererogatory resolution to hold his father's memory\nuntouched; nor to one single being in the world reveal the paternity of\nIsabel. Unrecallably dead and gone from out the living world, again\nreturned to utter helplessness, so far as this world went; his perished\nfather seemed to appeal to the dutifulness and mercifulness of Pierre,\nin terms far more moving than though the accents proceeded from his\nmortal mouth. And what though not through the sin of Pierre, but through\nhis father's sin, that father's fair fame now lay at the mercy of the\nson, and could only be kept inviolate by the son's free sacrifice of all\nearthly felicity;--what if this were so? It but struck a still loftier\nchord in the bosom of the son, and filled him with infinite\nmagnanimities. Never had the generous Pierre cherished the heathenish\nconceit, that even in the general world, Sin is a fair object to be\nstretched on the cruelest racks by self-complacent Virtue, that\nself-complacent Virtue may feed her lily-liveredness on the pallor of\nSin's anguish. For perfect Virtue does not more loudly claim our\napprobation, than repented Sin in its concludedness does demand our\nutmost tenderness and concern. And as the more immense the Virtue, so\nshould be the more immense our approbation; likewise the more immense\nthe Sin, the more infinite our pity. In some sort, Sin hath its\nsacredness, not less than holiness. And great Sin calls forth more\nmagnanimity than small Virtue. What man, who is a man, does not feel\nlivelier and more generous emotions toward the great god of\nSin--Satan,--than toward yonder haberdasher, who only is a sinner in\nthe small and entirely honorable way of trade?\n\nThough Pierre profoundly shuddered at that impenetrable yet blackly\nsignificant nebulousness, which the wild story of Isabel threw around\nthe early life of his father; yet as he recalled the dumb anguish of the\ninvocation of the empty and the ashy hand uplifted from his father's\ndeath-bed, he most keenly felt that of whatsoever unknown shade his\nfather's guilt might be, yet in the final hour of death it had been most\ndismally repented of; by a repentance only the more full of utter\nwretchedness, that it was a consuming secret in him. Mince the matter\nhow his family would, had not his father died a raver? Whence that\nraving, following so prosperous a life? Whence, but from the cruelest\ncompunctions?\n\nTouched thus, and strung in all his sinews and his nerves to the holding\nof his father's memory intact,--Pierre turned his confronting and\nunfrightened face toward Lucy Tartan, and stilly vowed that not even she\nshould know the whole; no, not know the least.\n\nThere is an inevitable keen cruelty in the loftier heroism. It is not\nheroism only to stand unflinched ourselves in the hour of suffering; but\nit is heroism to stand unflinched both at our own and at some loved\none's united suffering; a united suffering, which we could put an\ninstant period to, if we would but renounce the glorious cause for which\nourselves do bleed, and see our most loved one bleed. If he would not\nreveal his father's shame to the common world, whose favorable opinion\nfor himself, Pierre now despised; how then reveal it to the woman he\nadored? To her, above all others, would he now uncover his father's\ntomb, and bid her behold from what vile attaintings he himself had\nsprung? So Pierre turned round and tied Lucy to the same stake which\nmust hold himself, for he too plainly saw, that it could not be, but\nthat both their hearts must burn.\n\nYes, his resolve concerning his father's memory involved the necessity\nof assuming even to Lucy his marriage with Isabel. Here he could not\nexplain himself, even to her. This would aggravate the sharp pang of\nparting, by self-suggested, though wholly groundless surmising in Lucy's\nmind, in the most miserable degree contaminating to her idea of him. But\non this point, he still fondly trusted that without at all marring his\nfilial bond, he would be enabled by some significant intimations to\narrest in Lucy's mind those darker imaginings which might find entrance\nthere; and if he could not set her wholly right, yet prevent her from\ngoing wildly wrong.\n\nFor his mother Pierre was more prepared. He considered that by an\ninscrutable decree, which it was but foolishness to try to evade, or\nshun, or deny existence to, since he felt it so profoundly pressing on\nhis inmost soul; the family of the Glendinnings was imperiously called\nupon to offer up a victim to the gods of woe; one grand victim at the\nleast; and that grand victim must be his mother, or himself. If he\ndisclosed his secret to the world, then his mother was made the victim;\nif at all hazards he kept it to himself, then himself would be the\nvictim. A victim as respecting his mother, because under the peculiar\ncircumstances of the case, the non-disclosure of the secret involved her\nentire and infamy-engendering misconception of himself. But to this he\nbowed submissive.\n\nOne other thing--and the last to be here named, because the very least\nin the conscious thoughts of Pierre; one other thing remained to menace\nhim with assured disastrousness. This thing it was, which though but\ndimly hinted of as yet, still in the apprehension must have exerted a\npowerful influence upon Pierre, in preparing him for the worst.\n\nHis father's last and fatal sickness had seized him suddenly. Both the\nprobable concealed distraction of his mind with reference to his early\nlife as recalled to him in an evil hour, and his consequent mental\nwanderings; these, with other reasons, had prevented him from framing a\nnew will to supersede one made shortly after his marriage, and ere\nPierre was born. By that will which as yet had never been dragged into\nthe courts of law; and which, in the fancied security of her own and her\nson's congenial and loving future, Mrs. Glendinning had never but once,\nand then inconclusively, offered to discuss, with a view to a better and\nmore appropriate ordering of things to meet circumstances non-existent\nat the period the testament was framed; by that will, all the\nGlendinning property was declared his mother's.\n\nAcutely sensible to those prophetic intimations in him, which painted in\nadvance the haughty temper of his offended mother, as all bitterness and\nscorn toward a son, once the object of her proudest joy, but now become\na deep reproach, as not only rebellious to her, but glaringly\ndishonorable before the world; Pierre distinctly foresaw, that as she\nnever would have permitted Isabel Banford in her true character to cross\nher threshold; neither would she now permit Isabel Banford to cross her\nthreshold in any other, and disguised character; least of all, as that\nunknown and insidious girl, who by some pernicious arts had lured her\nonly son from honor into infamy. But not to admit Isabel, was now to\nexclude Pierre, if indeed on independent grounds of exasperation against\nhimself, his mother would not cast him out.\n\nNor did the same interior intimations in him which fore-painted the\nabove bearing of his mother, abstain to trace her whole haughty heart as\nso unrelentingly set against him, that while she would close her doors\nagainst both him and his fictitious wife, so also she would not\nwillingly contribute one copper to support them in a supposed union so\nentirely abhorrent to her. And though Pierre was not so familiar with\nthe science of the law, as to be quite certain what the law, if appealed\nto concerning the provisions of his father's will, would decree\nconcerning any possible claims of the son to share with the mother in\nthe property of the sire; yet he prospectively felt an invincible\nrepugnance to dragging his dead father's hand and seal into open Court,\nand fighting over them with a base mercenary motive, and with his own\nmother for the antagonist. For so thoroughly did his infallible\npresentiments paint his mother's character to him, as operated upon and\ndisclosed in all those fiercer traits,--hitherto held in abeyance by the\nmere chance and felicity of circumstances,--that he felt assured that\nher exasperation against him would even meet the test of a public legal\ncontention concerning the Glendinning property. For indeed there was a\nreserved strength and masculineness in the character of his mother, from\nwhich on all these points Pierre had every thing to dread. Besides, will\nthe matter how he would, Pierre for nearly two whole years to come,\nwould still remain a minor, an infant in the eye of the law, incapable\nof personally asserting any legal claim; and though he might sue by his\nnext friend, yet who would be his voluntary next friend, when the\nexecution of his great resolve would, for him, depopulate all the world\nof friends?\n\nNow to all these things, and many more, seemed the soul of this\ninfatuated young enthusiast braced.\n\n\nIII.\n\nThere is a dark, mad mystery in some human hearts, which, sometimes,\nduring the tyranny of a usurper mood, leads them to be all eagerness to\ncast off the most intense beloved bond, as a hindrance to the attainment\nof whatever transcendental object that usurper mood so tyrannically\nsuggests. Then the beloved bond seems to hold us to no essential good;\nlifted to exalted mounts, we can dispense with all the vale; endearments\nwe spurn; kisses are blisters to us; and forsaking the palpitating forms\nof mortal love, we emptily embrace the boundless and the unbodied air.\nWe think we are not human; we become as immortal bachelors and gods; but\nagain, like the Greek gods themselves, prone we descend to earth; glad\nto be uxorious once more; glad to hide these god-like heads within the\nbosoms made of too-seducing clay.\n\nWeary with the invariable earth, the restless sailor breaks from every\nenfolding arm, and puts to sea in height of tempest that blows off\nshore. But in long night-watches at the antipodes, how heavily that\nocean gloom lies in vast bales upon the deck; thinking that that very\nmoment in his deserted hamlet-home the household sun is high, and many a\nsun-eyed maiden meridian as the sun. He curses Fate; himself he curses;\nhis senseless madness, which is himself. For whoso once has known this\nsweet knowledge, and then fled it; in absence, to him the avenging dream\nwill come.\n\nPierre was now this vulnerable god; this self-upbraiding sailor; this\ndreamer of the avenging dream. Though in some things he had unjuggled\nhimself, and forced himself to eye the prospect as it was; yet, so far\nas Lucy was concerned, he was at bottom still a juggler. True, in his\nextraordinary scheme, Lucy was so intimately interwoven, that it seemed\nimpossible for him at all to cast his future without some way having\nthat heart's love in view. But ignorant of its quantity as yet, or\nfearful of ascertaining it; like an algebraist, for the real Lucy he, in\nhis scheming thoughts, had substituted but a sign--some empty _x_--and\nin the ultimate solution of the problem, that empty _x_ still figured;\nnot the real Lucy.\n\nBut now, when risen from the abasement of his chamber-floor, and risen\nfrom the still profounder prostration of his soul, Pierre had thought\nthat all the horizon of his dark fate was commanded by him; all his\nresolutions clearly defined, and immovably decreed; now finally, to top\nall, there suddenly slid into his inmost heart the living and breathing\nform of Lucy. His lungs collapsed; his eyeballs glared; for the sweet\nimagined form, so long buried alive in him, seemed now as gliding on\nhim from the grave; and her light hair swept far adown her shroud.\n\nThen, for the time, all minor things were whelmed in him; his mother,\nIsabel, the whole wide world; and one only thing remained to him;--this\nall-including query--Lucy or God?\n\nBut here we draw a vail. Some nameless struggles of the soul can not be\npainted, and some woes will not be told. Let the ambiguous procession of\nevents reveal their own ambiguousness.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK XI.\n\nHE CROSSES THE RUBICON\n\n\nI.\n\nSucked within the Maelstrom, man must go round. Strike at one end the\nlongest conceivable row of billiard balls in close contact, and the\nfurthermost ball will start forth, while all the rest stand still; and\nyet that last ball was not struck at all. So, through long previous\ngenerations, whether of births or thoughts, Fate strikes the present\nman. Idly he disowns the blow's effect, because he felt no blow, and\nindeed, received no blow. But Pierre was not arguing Fixed Fate and Free\nWill, now; Fixed Fate and Free Will were arguing him, and Fixed Fate got\nthe better in the debate.\n\nThe peculiarities of those influences which on the night and early\nmorning following the last interview with Isabel, persuaded Pierre to\nthe adoption of his final resolve, did now irresistibly impel him to a\nremarkable instantaneousness in his actions, even as before he had\nproved a lagger.\n\nWithout being consciously that way pointed, through the desire of\nanticipating any objections on the part of Isabel to the assumption of a\nmarriage between himself and her; Pierre was now impetuously hurried\ninto an act, which should have the effective virtue of such an executed\nintention, without its corresponding motive. Because, as the primitive\nresolve so deplorably involved Lucy, her image was then prominent in his\nmind; and hence, because he felt all eagerness to hold her no longer in\nsuspense, but by a certain sort of charity of cruelty, at once to\npronounce to her her fate; therefore, it was among his first final\nthoughts that morning to go to Lucy. And to this, undoubtedly, so\ntrifling a circumstance as her being nearer to him, geographically, than\nIsabel, must have contributed some added, though unconscious influence,\nin his present fateful frame of mind.\n\nOn the previous undetermined days, Pierre had solicitously sought to\ndisguise his emotions from his mother, by a certain carefulness and\nchoiceness in his dress. But now, since his very soul was forced to wear\na mask, he would wear no paltry palliatives and disguisements on his\nbody. He went to the cottage of Lucy as disordered in his person, as\nhaggard in his face.\n\n\nII.\n\nShe was not risen yet. So, the strange imperious instantaneousness in\nhim, impelled him to go straight to her chamber-door, and in a voice of\nmild invincibleness, demand immediate audience, for the matter pressed.\n\nAlready namelessly concerned and alarmed for her lover, now\neight-and-forty hours absent on some mysterious and undisclosable\naffair; Lucy, at this surprising summons was overwhelmed with sudden\nterror; and in oblivion of all ordinary proprieties, responded to\nPierre's call, by an immediate assent.\n\nOpening the door, he advanced slowly and deliberately toward her; and as\nLucy caught his pale determined figure, she gave a cry of groping\nmisery, which knew not the pang that caused it, and lifted herself\ntrembling in her bed; but without uttering one word.\n\nPierre sat down on the bedside; and his set eyes met her terrified and\nvirgin aspect.\n\n\"Decked in snow-white, and pale of cheek, thou indeed art fitted for the\naltar; but not that one of which thy fond heart did'st dream:--so fair a\nvictim!\"\n\n\"Pierre!\"\n\n\"'Tis the last cruelty of tyrants to make their enemies slay each\nother.\"\n\n\"My heart! my heart!\"\n\n\"Nay;---- Lucy, I am married.\"\n\nThe girl was no more pale, but white as any leper; the bed-clothes\ntrembled to the concealed shudderings of all her limbs; one moment she\nsat looking vacantly into the blank eyes of Pierre, and then fell over\ntoward him in a swoon.\n\nSwift madness mounted into the brain of Pierre; all the past seemed as a\ndream, and all the present an unintelligible horror. He lifted her, and\nextended her motionless form upon the bed, and stamped for succor. The\nmaid Martha came running into the room, and beholding those two\ninexplicable figures, shrieked, and turned in terror. But Pierre's\nrepeated cry rallied Martha from this, and darting out of the chamber,\nshe returned with a sharp restorative, which at length brought Lucy back\nto life.\n\n\"Martha! Martha!\" now murmured Lucy, in a scarce audible whispering, and\nshuddering in the maid's own shuddering arms, \"quick, quick; come to\nme--drive it away! wake me! wake me!\"\n\n\"Nay, pray God to sleep again,\" cried Martha, bending over her and\nembracing her, and half-turning upon Pierre with a glance of loathing\nindignation. \"In God's holy name, sir, what may this be? How came you\nhere; accursed!\"\n\n\"Accursed?--it is well. Is she herself again, Martha?\"\n\n\"Thou hast somehow murdered her; how then be herself again? My sweet\nmistress! oh, my young mistress! Tell me! tell me!\" and she bent low\nover her.\n\nPierre now advanced toward the bed, making a gesture for the maid to\nleave them; but soon as Lucy re-caught his haggard form, she\nwhisperingly wailed again, \"Martha! Martha! drive it\naway!--there--there! him--him!\" and shut her eyes convulsively, with\narms abhorrently outstretched.\n\n\"Monster! incomprehensible fiend!\" cried the anew terror-smitten\nmaid--\"depart! See! she dies away at the sight of thee--begone! Wouldst\nthou murder her afresh? Begone!\"\n\nStarched and frozen by his own emotion, Pierre silently turned and\nquitted the chamber; and heavily descending the stairs, tramped\nheavily--as a man slowly bearing a great burden--through a long narrow\npassage leading to a wing in the rear of the cottage, and knocking at\nMiss Lanyllyn's door, summoned her to Lucy, who, he briefly said, had\nfainted. Then, without waiting for any response, left the house, and\nwent directly to the mansion.\n\n\nIII.\n\n\"Is my mother up yet?\" said he to Dates, whom he met in the hall.\n\n\"Not yet, sir;--heavens, sir! are you sick?\"\n\n\"To death! Let me pass.\"\n\nAscending toward his mother's chamber, he heard a coming step, and met\nher on the great middle landing of the stairs, where in an ample niche,\na marble group of the temple-polluting Laocoon and his two innocent\nchildren, caught in inextricable snarls of snakes, writhed in eternal\ntorments.\n\n\"Mother, go back with me to thy chamber.\"\n\nShe eyed his sudden presence with a dark but repressed foreboding; drew\nherself up haughtily and repellingly, and with a quivering lip, said,\n\"Pierre, thou thyself hast denied me thy confidence, and thou shall not\nforce me back to it so easily. Speak! what is that now between thee and\nme?\"\n\n\"I am married, mother.\"\n\n\"Great God! To whom?\"\n\n\"Not to Lucy Tartan, mother.\"\n\n\"That thou merely sayest 'tis not Lucy, without saying who indeed it is,\nthis is good proof she is something vile. Does Lucy know thy marriage?\"\n\n\"I am but just from Lucy's.\"\n\nThus far Mrs. Glendinning's rigidity had been slowly relaxing. Now she\nclutched the balluster, bent over, and trembled, for a moment. Then\nerected all her haughtiness again, and stood before Pierre in incurious,\nunappeasable grief and scorn for him.\n\n\"My dark soul prophesied something dark. If already thou hast not found\nother lodgment, and other table than this house supplies, then seek it\nstraight. Beneath my roof, and at my table, he who was once Pierre\nGlendinning no more puts himself.\"\n\nShe turned from him, and with a tottering step climbed the winding\nstairs, and disappeared from him; while in the balluster he held, Pierre\nseemed to feel the sudden thrill running down to him from his mother's\nconvulsive grasp.\n\nHe stared about him with an idiot eye; staggered to the floor below, to\ndumbly quit the house; but as he crossed its threshold, his foot tripped\nupon its raised ledge; he pitched forward upon the stone portico, and\nfell. He seemed as jeeringly hurled from beneath his own ancestral\nroof.\n\n\nIV.\n\nPassing through the broad court-yard's postern, Pierre closed it after\nhim, and then turned and leaned upon it, his eyes fixed upon the great\ncentral chimney of the mansion, from which a light blue smoke was\nwreathing gently into the morning air.\n\n\"The hearth-stone from which thou risest, never more, I inly feel, will\nthese feet press. Oh God, what callest thou that which has thus made\nPierre a vagabond?\"\n\nHe walked slowly away, and passing the windows of Lucy, looked up, and\nsaw the white curtains closely drawn, the white-cottage profoundly\nstill, and a white saddle-horse tied before the gate.\n\n\"I would enter, but again would her abhorrent wails repel; what more can\nI now say or do to her? I can not explain. She knows all I purposed to\ndisclose. Ay, but thou didst cruelly burst upon her with it; thy\nimpetuousness, thy instantaneousness hath killed her, Pierre!--Nay, nay,\nnay!--Cruel tidings who can gently break? If to stab be inevitable; then\ninstant be the dagger! Those curtains are close drawn upon her; so let\nme upon her sweet image draw the curtains of my soul. Sleep, sleep,\nsleep, sleep, thou angel!--wake no more to Pierre, nor to thyself, my\nLucy!\"\n\nPassing on now hurriedly and blindly, he jostled against some\noppositely-going wayfarer. The man paused amazed; and looking up, Pierre\nrecognized a domestic of the Mansion. That instantaneousness which now\nimpelled him in all his actions, again seized the ascendency in him.\nIgnoring the dismayed expression of the man at thus encountering his\nyoung master, Pierre commanded him to follow him. Going straight to the\n\"Black Swan,\" the little village Inn, he entered the first vacant room,\nand bidding the man be seated, sought the keeper of the house, and\nordered pen and paper.\n\nIf fit opportunity offer in the hour of unusual affliction, minds of a\ncertain temperament find a strange, hysterical relief, in a wild,\nperverse humorousness, the more alluring from its entire unsuitableness\nto the occasion; although they seldom manifest this trait toward those\nindividuals more immediately involved in the cause or the effect of\ntheir suffering. The cool censoriousness of the mere philosopher would\ndenominate such conduct as nothing short of temporary madness; and\nperhaps it is, since, in the inexorable and inhuman eye of mere\nundiluted reason, all grief, whether on our own account, or that of\nothers, is the sheerest unreason and insanity.\n\nThe note now written was the following:\n\n\n                  \"_For that Fine Old Fellow, Dates._\n\n     \"Dates, my old boy, bestir thyself now. Go to my room, Dates, and\n     bring me down my mahogany strong-box and lock-up, the thing covered\n     with blue chintz; strap it very carefully, my sweet Dates, it is\n     rather heavy, and set it just without the postern. Then back and\n     bring me down my writing-desk, and set that, too, just without the\n     postern. Then back yet again, and bring me down the old camp-bed\n     (see that all the parts be there), and bind the case well with a\n     cord. Then go to the left corner little drawer in my wardrobe, and\n     thou wilt find my visiting-cards. Tack one on the chest, and the\n     desk, and the camp-bed case. Then get all my clothes together, and\n     pack them in trunks (not forgetting the two old military cloaks, my\n     boy), and tack cards on them also, my good Dates. Then fly round\n     three times indefinitely, my good Dates, and wipe a little of the\n     perspiration off. And then--let me see--then, my good Dates--why\n     what then? Why, this much. Pick up all papers of all sorts that may\n     be lying round my chamber, and see them burned. And then--have old\n     White Hoof put to the lightest farm-wagon, and send the chest, and\n     the desk, and the camp-bed, and the trunks to the 'Black Swan,'\n     where I shall call for them, when I am ready, and not before, sweet\n     Dates. So God bless thee, my fine, old, imperturbable Dates, and\n     adieu!\n\n    \"Thy old young master,\n     PIERRE.\n\n     \"_Nota bene_--Mark well, though, Dates. Should my mother possibly\n     interrupt thee, say that it is my orders, and mention what it is I\n     send for; but on no account show this to thy mistress--D'ye hear?\n\n     PIERRE again.\"\n\nFolding this scrawl into a grotesque shape, Pierre ordered the man to\ntake it forthwith to Dates. But the man, all perplexed, hesitated,\nturning the billet over in his hand; till Pierre loudly and violently\nbade him begone; but as the man was then rapidly departing in a panic,\nPierre called him back and retracted his rude words; but as the servant\nnow lingered again, perhaps thinking to avail himself of this repentant\nmood in Pierre, to say something in sympathy or remonstrance to him,\nPierre ordered him off with augmented violence, and stamped for him to\nbegone.\n\nApprising the equally perplexed old landlord that certain things would\nin the course of that forenoon be left for him, (Pierre,) at the Inn;\nand also desiring him to prepare a chamber for himself and wife that\nnight; some chamber with a commodious connecting room, which might\nanswer for a dressing-room; and likewise still another chamber for a\nservant; Pierre departed the place, leaving the old landlord staring\nvacantly at him, and dumbly marveling what horrible thing had happened\nto turn the brain of his fine young favorite and old shooting comrade,\nMaster Pierre.\n\nSoon the short old man went out bare-headed upon the low porch of the\nInn, descended its one step, and crossed over to the middle of the road,\ngazing after Pierre. And only as Pierre turned up a distant lane, did\nhis amazement and his solicitude find utterance.\n\n\"I taught him--yes, old Casks;--the best shot in all the country round\nis Master Pierre;--pray God he hits not now the bull's eye in\nhimself.--Married? married? and coming here?--This is pesky strange!\"\n\n\n\n\nBOOK XII.\n\nISABEL: MRS. GLENDINNING: THE PORTRAIT: AND LUCY.\n\n\nI.\n\nWhen on the previous night Pierre had left the farm-house where Isabel\nharbored, it will be remembered that no hour, either of night or day, no\nspecial time at all had been assigned for a succeeding interview. It was\nIsabel, who for some doubtlessly sufficient reason of her own, had, for\nthe first meeting, assigned the early hour of darkness.\n\nAs now, when the full sun was well up the heavens, Pierre drew near the\nfarm-house of the Ulvers, he descried Isabel, standing without the\nlittle dairy-wing, occupied in vertically arranging numerous glittering\nshield-like milk-pans on a long shelf, where they might purifyingly meet\nthe sun. Her back was toward him. As Pierre passed through the open\nwicket and crossed the short soft green sward, he unconsciously muffled\nhis footsteps, and now standing close behind his sister, touched her\nshoulder and stood still.\n\nShe started, trembled, turned upon him swiftly, made a low, strange cry,\nand then gazed rivetedly and imploringly upon him.\n\n\"I look rather queerish, sweet Isabel, do I not?\" said Pierre at last\nwith a writhed and painful smile.\n\n\"My brother, my blessed brother!--speak--tell me--what has\nhappened--what hast thou done? Oh! Oh! I should have warned thee before,\nPierre, Pierre; it is my fault--mine, mine!\"\n\n\"_What_ is thy fault, sweet Isabel?\"\n\n\"Thou hast revealed Isabel to thy mother, Pierre.\"\n\n\"I have not, Isabel. Mrs. Glendinning knows not thy secret at all.\"\n\n\"Mrs. Glendinning?--that's,--that's thine own mother, Pierre! In\nheaven's name, my brother, explain thyself. Knows not my secret, and yet\nthou here so suddenly, and with such a fatal aspect? Come, come with me\ninto the house. Quick, Pierre, why dost thou not stir? Oh, my God! if\nmad myself sometimes, I am to make mad him who loves me best, and who, I\nfear, has in some way ruined himself for me;--then, let me no more stand\nupright on this sod, but fall prone beneath it, that I may be hidden!\nTell me!\" catching Pierre's arms in both her frantic hands--\"tell me, do\nI blast where I look? is my face Gorgon's?\"\n\n\"Nay, sweet Isabel; but it hath a more sovereign power; that turned to\nstone; thine might turn white marble into mother's milk.\"\n\n\"Come with me--come quickly.\"\n\nThey passed into the dairy, and sat down on a bench by the honey-suckled\ncasement.\n\n\"Pierre, forever fatal and accursed be the day my longing heart called\nthee to me, if now, in the very spring-time of our related love, thou\nart minded to play deceivingly with me, even though thou should'st fancy\nit for my good. Speak to me; oh speak to me, my brother!\"\n\n\"Thou hintest of deceiving one for one's good. Now supposing, sweet\nIsabel, that in no case would I affirmatively deceive thee;--in no case\nwhatever;--would'st thou then be willing for thee and me to piously\ndeceive others, for both their and our united good?--Thou sayest\nnothing. Now, then, is it _my_ turn, sweet Isabel, to bid thee speak to\nme, oh speak to me!\"\n\n\"That unknown, approaching thing, seemeth ever ill, my brother, which\nmust have unfrank heralds to go before. Oh, Pierre, dear, dear Pierre;\nbe very careful with me! This strange, mysterious, unexampled love\nbetween us, makes me all plastic in thy hand. Be very careful with me. I\nknow little out of me. The world seems all one unknown India to me. Look\nup, look on me, Pierre; say now, thou wilt be very careful; say so, say\nso, Pierre!\"\n\n\"If the most exquisite, and fragile filagree of Genoa be carefully\nhandled by its artisan; if sacred nature carefully folds, and warms, and\nby inconceivable attentivenesses eggs round and round her minute and\nmarvelous embryoes; then, Isabel, do I most carefully and most tenderly\negg thee, gentlest one, and the fate of thee! Short of the great God,\nIsabel, there lives none who will be more careful with thee, more\ninfinitely considerate and delicate with thee.\"\n\n\"From my deepest heart, do I believe thee, Pierre. Yet thou mayest be\nvery delicate in some point, where delicateness is not all essential,\nand in some quick impulsive hour, omit thy fullest heedfulness somewhere\nwhere heedlessness were most fatal. Nay, nay, my brother; bleach these\nlocks snow-white, thou sun! if I have any thought to reproach thee,\nPierre, or betray distrust of thee. But earnestness must sometimes seem\nsuspicious, else it is none. Pierre, Pierre, all thy aspect speaks\neloquently of some already executed resolution, born in suddenness.\nSince I last saw thee, Pierre, some deed irrevocable has been done by\nthee. My soul is stiff and starched to it; now tell me what it is?\"\n\n\"Thou, and I, and Delly Ulver, to-morrow morning depart this whole\nneighborhood, and go to the distant city.--That is it.\"\n\n\"No more?\"\n\n\"Is it not enough?\"\n\n\"There is something more, Pierre.\"\n\n\"Thou hast not yet answered a question I put to thee but just now.\nBethink thee, Isabel. The deceiving of others by thee and me, in a thing\nwholly pertaining to ourselves, for their and our united good. Wouldst\nthou?\"\n\n\"I would do any thing that does not tend to the marring of thy best\nlasting fortunes, Pierre. What is it thou wouldst have thee and me to do\ntogether? I wait; I wait!\"\n\n\"Let us go into the room of the double casement, my sister,\" said\nPierre, rising.\n\n\"Nay, then; if it can not be said here, then can I not do it anywhere,\nmy brother; for it would harm thee.\"\n\n\"Girl!\" cried Pierre, sternly, \"if for thee I have lost\"--but he checked\nhimself.\n\n\"Lost? for me? Now does the very worst blacken on me. Pierre! Pierre!\"\n\n\"I was foolish, and sought but to frighten thee, my sister. It was very\nfoolish. Do thou now go on with thine innocent work here, and I will\ncome again a few hours hence. Let me go now.\"\n\nHe was turning from her, when Isabel sprang forward to him, caught him\nwith both her arms round him, and held him so convulsively, that her\nhair sideways swept over him, and half concealed him.\n\n\"Pierre, if indeed my soul hath cast on thee the same black shadow that\nmy hair now flings on thee; if thou hast lost aught for me; then\neternally is Isabel lost to Isabel, and Isabel will not outlive this\nnight. If I am indeed an accursing thing, I will not act the given part,\nbut cheat the air, and die from it. See; I let thee go, lest some poison\nI know not of distill upon thee from me.\"\n\nShe slowly drooped, and trembled from him. But Pierre caught her, and\nsupported her.\n\n\"Foolish, foolish one! Behold, in the very bodily act of loosing hold of\nme, thou dost reel and fall;--unanswerable emblem of the indispensable\nheart-stay, I am to thee, my sweet, sweet Isabel! Prate not then of\nparting.\"\n\n\"What hast thou lost for me? Tell me!\"\n\n\"A gainful loss, my sister!\"\n\n\"'Tis mere rhetoric! What hast thou lost?\"\n\n\"Nothing that my inmost heart would now recall. I have bought inner love\nand glory by a price, which, large or small, I would not now have paid\nme back, so I must return the thing I bought.\"\n\n\"Is love then cold, and glory white? Thy cheek is snowy, Pierre.\"\n\n\"It should be, for I believe to God that I am pure, let the world think\nhow it may.\"\n\n\"What hast thou lost?\"\n\n\"Not thee, nor the pride and glory of ever loving thee, and being a\ncontinual brother to thee, my best sister. Nay, why dost thou now turn\nthy face from me?\"\n\n\"With fine words he wheedles me, and coaxes me, not to know some secret\nthing. Go, go, Pierre, come to me when thou wilt. I am steeled now to\nthe worst, and to the last. Again I tell thee, I will do any thing--yes,\nany thing that Pierre commands--for, though outer ill do lower upon us,\nstill, deep within, thou wilt be careful, very careful with me, Pierre?\"\n\n\"Thou art made of that fine, unshared stuff of which God makes his\nseraphim. But thy divine devotedness to me, is met by mine to thee. Well\nmayest thou trust me, Isabel; and whatever strangest thing I may yet\npropose to thee, thy confidence,--will it not bear me out? Surely thou\nwill not hesitate to plunge, when I plunge first;--already have I\nplunged! now thou canst not stay upon the bank. Hearken, hearken to\nme.--I seek not now to gain thy prior assent to a thing as yet undone;\nbut I call to thee now, Isabel, from the depth of a foregone act, to\nratify it, backward, by thy consent. Look not so hard upon me. Listen. I\nwill tell all. Isabel, though thou art all fearfulness to injure any\nliving thing, least of all, thy brother; still thy true heart\nforeknoweth not the myriad alliances and criss-crossings among mankind,\nthe infinite entanglements of all social things, which forbids that one\nthread should fly the general fabric, on some new line of duty, without\ntearing itself and tearing others. Listen. All that has happened up to\nthis moment, and all that may be yet to happen, some sudden inspiration\nnow assures me, inevitably proceeded from the first hour I saw thee. Not\npossibly could it, or can it, be otherwise. Therefore feel I, that I\nhave some patience. Listen. Whatever outer things might possibly be\nmine; whatever seeming brightest blessings; yet now to live uncomforting\nand unloving to thee, Isabel; now to dwell domestically away from thee;\nso that only by stealth, and base connivances of the night, I could come\nto thee as thy related brother; this would be, and is, unutterably\nimpossible. In my bosom a secret adder of self-reproach and self-infamy\nwould never leave off its sting. Listen. But without gratuitous dishonor\nto a memory which--for right cause or wrong--is ever sacred and\ninviolate to me, I can not be an open brother to thee, Isabel. But thou\nwantest not the openness; for thou dost not pine for empty nominalness,\nbut for vital realness; what thou wantest, is not the occasional\nopenness of my brotherly love; but its continual domestic confidence. Do\nI not speak thine own hidden heart to thee? say, Isabel? Well, then,\nstill listen to me. One only way presents to this; a most strange way,\nIsabel; to the world, that never throbbed for thee in love, a most\ndeceitful way; but to all a harmless way; so harmless in its essence,\nIsabel, that, seems to me, Pierre hath consulted heaven itself upon it,\nand heaven itself did not say Nay. Still, listen to me; mark me. As thou\nknowest that thou wouldst now droop and die without me; so would I\nwithout thee. We are equal there; mark _that_, too, Isabel. I do not\nstoop to thee, nor thou to me; but we both reach up alike to a glorious\nideal! Now the continualness, the secretness, yet the always present\ndomesticness of our love; how may we best compass that, without\njeopardizing the ever-sacred memory I hinted of? One way--one way--only\none! A strange way, but most pure. Listen. Brace thyself: here, let me\nhold thee now; and then whisper it to thee, Isabel. Come, I holding\nthee, thou canst not fall.\"\n\nHe held her tremblingly; she bent over toward him; his mouth wet her\near; he whispered it.\n\nThe girl moved not; was done with all her tremblings; leaned closer to\nhim, with an inexpressible strangeness of an intense love, new and\ninexplicable. Over the face of Pierre there shot a terrible\nself-revelation; he imprinted repeated burning kisses upon her; pressed\nhard her hand; would not let go her sweet and awful passiveness.\n\nThen they changed; they coiled together, and entangledly stood mute.\n\n\nII.\n\nMrs. Glendinning walked her chamber; her dress loosened.\n\n\"That such accursed vileness should proceed from me! Now will the\ntongued world say--See the vile boy of Mary Glendinning!--Deceitful!\nthick with guilt, where I thought it was all guilelessness and gentlest\ndocility to me. It has not happened! It is not day! Were this thing so,\nI should go mad, and be shut up, and not walk here where every door is\nopen to me.--My own only son married to an unknown--thing! My own only\nson, false to his holiest plighted public vow--and the wide world\nknowing to it! He bears my name--Glendinning. I will disown it; were it\nlike this dress, I would tear my name off from me, and burn it till it\nshriveled to a crisp!--Pierre! Pierre! come back, come back, and swear\nit is not so! It can not be! Wait: I will ring the bell, and see if it\nbe so.\"\n\nShe rung the bell with violence, and soon heard a responsive knock.\n\n\"Come in!--Nay, falter not;\" (throwing a shawl over her) \"come in. Stand\nthere and tell me if thou darest, that my son was in this house this\nmorning and met me on the stairs. Darest thou say that?\"\n\nDates looked confounded at her most unwonted aspect.\n\n\"Say it! find thy tongue! Or I will root mine out and fling it at thee!\nSay it!\"\n\n\"My dear mistress!\"\n\n\"I am not thy mistress! but thou my master; for, if thou sayest it, thou\ncommandest me to madness.--Oh, vile boy!--Begone from me!\"\n\nShe locked the door upon him, and swiftly and distractedly walked her\nchamber. She paused, and tossing down the curtains, shut out the sun\nfrom the two windows.\n\nAnother, but an unsummoned knock, was at the door. She opened it.\n\n\"My mistress, his Reverence is below. I would not call you, but he\ninsisted.\"\n\n\"Let him come up.\"\n\n\"Here? Immediately?\"\n\n\"Didst thou hear me? Let Mr. Falsgrave come up.\"\n\nAs if suddenly and admonishingly made aware, by Dates, of the\nungovernable mood of Mrs. Glendinning, the clergyman entered the open\ndoor of her chamber with a most deprecating but honest reluctance, and\napprehensiveness of he knew not what.\n\n\"Be seated, sir; stay, shut the door and lock it.\"\n\n\"Madam!\"\n\n\"_I_ will do it. Be seated. Hast thou seen him?\"\n\n\"Whom, Madam?--Master Pierre?\"\n\n\"Him!--quick!\"\n\n\"It was to speak of him I came, Madam. He made a most extraordinary call\nupon me last night--midnight.\"\n\n\"And thou marriedst him?--Damn thee!\"\n\n\"Nay, nay, nay, Madam; there is something here I know not of--I came to\ntell thee news, but thou hast some o'erwhelming tidings to reveal to\nme.\"\n\n\"I beg no pardons; but I may be sorry. Mr. Falsgrave, my son, standing\npublicly plighted to Lucy Tartan, has privately wedded some other\ngirl--some slut!\"\n\n\"Impossible!\"\n\n\"True as thou art there. Thou knowest nothing of it then?\"\n\n\"Nothing, nothing--not one grain till now. Who is it he has wedded?\"\n\n\"Some _slut_, I tell thee!--I am no lady now, but something deeper,--a\nwoman!--an outraged and pride-poisoned woman!\"\n\nShe turned from him swiftly, and again paced the room, as frantic and\nentirely regardless of any presence. Waiting for her to pause, but in\nvain, Mr. Falsgrave advanced toward her cautiously, and with the\nprofoundest deference, which was almost a cringing, spoke:--\n\n\"It is the hour of woe to thee; and I confess my cloth hath no\nconsolation for thee yet awhile. Permit me to withdraw from thee,\nleaving my best prayers for thee, that thou mayst know some peace, ere\nthis now shut-out sun goes down. Send for me whenever thou desirest\nme.--May I go now?\"\n\n\"Begone! and let me not hear thy soft, mincing voice, which is an infamy\nto a man! Begone, thou helpless, and unhelping one!\"\n\nShe swiftly paced the room again, swiftly muttering to herself. \"Now,\nnow, now, now I see it clearer, clearer--clear now as day! My first dim\nsuspicions pointed right!--too right! Ay--the sewing! it was the\nsewing!--The shriek!--I saw him gazing rooted at her. He would not speak\ngoing home with me. I charged him with his silence; he put me off with\nlies, lies, lies! Ay, ay, he is married to her, to her;--to\nher!--perhaps was then. And yet,--and yet,--how can it be?--Lucy,\nLucy--I saw him, after that, look on her as if he would be glad to die\nfor her, and go to hell for her, whither he deserves to go!--Oh! oh! oh!\nThus ruthlessly to cut off, at one gross sensual dash, the fair\nsuccession of an honorable race! Mixing the choicest wine with filthy\nwater from the plebeian pool, and so turning all to undistinguishable\nrankness!--Oh viper! had I thee now in me, I would be a suicide and a\nmurderer with one blow!\"\n\nA third knock was at the door. She opened it.\n\n\"My mistress, I thought it would disturb you,--it is so just\noverhead,--so I have not removed them yet.\"\n\n\"Unravel thy gibberish!--what is it?\"\n\n\"Pardon, my mistress, I somehow thought you knew it, but you can not.\"\n\n\"What is that writing crumpling in thy hand? Give it me.\"\n\n\"I have promised my young master not to, my mistress.\"\n\n\"I will snatch it, then, and so leave thee blameless.--What? what?\nwhat?--He's mad sure!--'Fine old fellow Dates'--what? what?--mad and\nmerry!--chest?--clothes?--trunks?--he wants them?--Tumble them out of\nhis window!--and if he stand right beneath, tumble them out! Dismantle\nthat whole room. Tear up the carpet. I swear, he shall leave no smallest\nvestige in this house.--Here! this very spot--here, here, where I stand,\nhe may have stood upon;--yes, he tied my shoe-string here; it's\nslippery! Dates!\"\n\n\"My mistress.\"\n\n\"Do his bidding. By reflection he has made me infamous to the world; and\nI will make him infamous to it. Listen, and do not delude thyself that\nI am crazy. Go up to yonder room\" (pointing upward), \"and remove every\narticle in it, and where he bid thee set down the chest and trunks,\nthere set down all the contents of that room.\"\n\n\"'Twas before the house--this house!\"\n\n\"And if it had not been there, I would not order thee to put them there.\nDunce! I would have the world know that I disown and scorn him! Do my\nbidding!--Stay. Let the room stand; but take him what he asks for.\"\n\n\"I will, my mistress.\"\n\nAs Dates left the chamber, Mrs. Glendinning again paced it swiftly, and\nagain swiftly muttered: \"Now, if I were less a strong and haughty woman,\nthe fit would have gone by ere now. But deep volcanoes long burn, ere\nthey burn out.--Oh, that the world were made of such malleable stuff,\nthat we could recklessly do our fieriest heart's-wish before it, and not\nfalter. Accursed be those four syllables of sound which make up that\nvile word Propriety. It is a chain and bell to drag;--drag? what sound\nis that? there's dragging--his trunks--the traveler's--dragging out. Oh\nwould I could so drag my heart, as fishers for the drowned do, as that I\nmight drag up my sunken happiness! Boy! boy! worse than brought in\ndripping drowned to me,--drowned in icy infamy! Oh! oh! oh!\"\n\nShe threw herself upon the bed, covered her face, and lay motionless.\nBut suddenly rose again, and hurriedly rang the bell.\n\n\"Open that desk, and draw the stand to me. Now wait and take this to\nMiss Lucy.\"\n\nWith a pencil she rapidly traced these lines:--\n\n\"My heart bleeds for thee, sweet Lucy. I can not speak--I know it all.\nLook for me the first hour I regain myself.\"\n\nAgain she threw herself upon the bed, and lay motionless.\n\n\nIII.\n\nToward sundown that evening, Pierre stood in one of the three bespoken\nchambers in the Black Swan Inn; the blue chintz-covered chest and the\nwriting-desk before him. His hands were eagerly searching through his\npockets.\n\n\"The key! the key! Nay, then, I must force it open. It bodes ill, too.\nYet lucky is it, some bankers can break into their own vaults, when\nother means do fail. Not so, ever. Let me see:--yes, the tongs there.\nNow then for the sweet sight of gold and silver. I never loved it till\nthis day. How long it has been hoarded;--little token pieces, of years\nago, from aunts, uncles, cousins innumerable, and from--but I won't\nmention _them_; dead henceforth to me! Sure there'll be a premium on\nsuch ancient gold. There's some broad bits, token pieces to my--I name\nhim not--more than half a century ago. Well, well, I never thought to\ncast them back into the sordid circulations whence they came. But if\nthey must be spent, now is the time, in this last necessity, and in this\nsacred cause. 'Tis a most stupid, dunderheaded crowbar. Hoy! so! ah, now\nfor it:--snake's nest!\"\n\nForced suddenly back, the chest-lid had as suddenly revealed to him the\nchair-portrait lying on top of all the rest, where he had secreted it\nsome days before. Face up, it met him with its noiseless, ever-nameless,\nand ambiguous, unchanging smile. Now his first repugnance was augmented\nby an emotion altogether new. That certain lurking lineament in the\nportrait, whose strange transfer blended with far other, and sweeter,\nand nobler characteristics, was visible in the countenance of Isabel;\nthat lineament in the portrait was somehow now detestable; nay,\naltogether loathsome, ineffably so, to Pierre. He argued not with\nhimself why this was so; he only felt it, and most keenly.\n\nOmitting more subtile inquisition into this deftly-winding theme, it\nwill be enough to hint, perhaps, that possibly one source of this new\nhatefulness had its primary and unconscious rise in one of those\nprofound ideas, which at times atmospherically, as it were, do insinuate\nthemselves even into very ordinary minds. In the strange relativeness,\nreciprocalness, and transmittedness, between the long-dead father's\nportrait, and the living daughter's face, Pierre might have seemed to\nsee reflected to him, by visible and uncontradictable symbols, the\ntyranny of Time and Fate. Painted before the daughter was conceived or\nborn, like a dumb seer, the portrait still seemed leveling its prophetic\nfinger at that empty air, from which Isabel did finally emerge. There\nseemed to lurk some mystical intelligence and vitality in the picture;\nbecause, since in his own memory of his father, Pierre could not recall\nany distinct lineament transmitted to Isabel, but vaguely saw such in\nthe portrait; therefore, not Pierre's parent, as any way rememberable by\nhim, but the portrait's painted _self_ seemed the real father of Isabel;\nfor, so far as all sense went, Isabel had inherited one peculiar trait\nno-whither traceable but to it.\n\nAnd as his father was now sought to be banished from his mind, as a most\nbitter presence there, but Isabel was become a thing of intense and\nfearful love for him; therefore, it was loathsome to him, that in the\nsmiling and ambiguous portrait, her sweet mournful image should be so\nsinisterly becrooked, bemixed, and mutilated to him.\n\nWhen, the first shock, and then the pause were over, he lifted the\nportrait in his two hands, and held it averted from him.\n\n\"It shall not live. Hitherto I have hoarded up mementoes and monuments\nof the past; been a worshiper of all heirlooms; a fond filer away of\nletters, locks of hair, bits of ribbon, flowers, and the\nthousand-and-one minutenesses which love and memory think they\nsanctify:--but it is forever over now! If to me any memory shall\nhenceforth be dear, I will not mummy it in a visible memorial for every\npassing beggar's dust to gather on. Love's museum is vain and foolish as\nthe Catacombs, where grinning apes and abject lizards are embalmed, as,\nforsooth, significant of some imagined charm. It speaks merely of decay\nand death, and nothing more; decay and death of endless innumerable\ngenerations; it makes of earth one mold. How can lifelessness be fit\nmemorial of life?--So far, for mementoes of the sweetest. As for the\nrest--now I know this, that in commonest memorials, the twilight fact of\ndeath first discloses in some secret way, all the ambiguities of that\ndeparted thing or person; obliquely it casts hints, and insinuates\nsurmises base, and eternally incapable of being cleared. Decreed by God\nOmnipotent it is, that Death should be the last scene of the last act of\nman's play;--a play, which begin how it may, in farce or comedy, ever\nhath its tragic end; the curtain inevitably falls upon a corpse.\nTherefore, never more will I play the vile pigmy, and by small memorials\nafter death, attempt to reverse the decree of death, by essaying the\npoor perpetuating of the image of the original. Let all die, and mix\nagain! As for this--this!--why longer should I preserve it? Why preserve\nthat on which one can not patient look? If I am resolved to hold his\npublic memory inviolate,--destroy this thing; for here is the one great,\ncondemning, and unsuborned proof, whose mysticalness drives me half\nmad.--Of old Greek times, before man's brain went into doting bondage,\nand bleached and beaten in Baconian fulling-mills, his four limbs lost\ntheir barbaric tan and beauty; when the round world was fresh, and rosy,\nand spicy, as a new-plucked apple;--all's wilted now!--in those bold\ntimes, the great dead were not, turkey-like, dished in trenchers, and\nset down all garnished in the ground, to glut the damned Cyclop like a\ncannibal; but nobly envious Life cheated the glutton worm, and\ngloriously burned the corpse; so that the spirit up-pointed, and visibly\nforked to heaven!\n\n\"So now will I serve thee. Though that solidity of which thou art the\nunsolid duplicate, hath long gone to its hideous church-yard\naccount;--and though, God knows! but for one part of thee it may have\nbeen fit auditing;--yet will I now a second time see thy obsequies\nperformed, and by now burning thee, urn thee in the great vase of air!\nCome now!\"\n\nA small wood-fire had been kindled on the hearth to purify the\nlong-closed room; it was now diminished to a small pointed heap of\nglowing embers. Detaching and dismembering the gilded but tarnished\nframe, Pierre laid the four pieces on the coals; as their dryness soon\ncaught the sparks, he rolled the reversed canvas into a scroll, and tied\nit, and committed it to the now crackling, clamorous flames. Steadfastly\nPierre watched the first crispings and blackenings of the painted\nscroll, but started as suddenly unwinding from the burnt string that had\ntied it, for one swift instant, seen through the flame and smoke, the\nupwrithing portrait tormentedly stared at him in beseeching horror, and\nthen, wrapped in one broad sheet of oily fire, disappeared forever.\n\nYielding to a sudden ungovernable impulse, Pierre darted his hand among\nthe flames, to rescue the imploring face; but as swiftly drew back his\nscorched and bootless grasp. His hand was burnt and blackened, but he\ndid not heed it.\n\nHe ran back to the chest, and seizing repeated packages of family\nletters, and all sorts of miscellaneous memorials in paper, he threw\nthem one after the other upon the fire.\n\n\"Thus, and thus, and thus! on thy manes I fling fresh spoils; pour out\nall my memory in one libation!--so, so, so--lower, lower, lower; now all\nis done, and all is ashes! Henceforth, cast-out Pierre hath no\npaternity, and no past; and since the Future is one blank to all;\ntherefore, twice-disinherited Pierre stands untrammeledly his\never-present self!--free to do his own self-will and present fancy to\nwhatever end!\"\n\n\nIV.\n\nThat same sunset Lucy lay in her chamber. A knock was heard at its door,\nand the responding Martha was met by the now self-controlled and\nresolute face of Mrs. Glendinning.\n\n\"How is your young mistress, Martha? May I come in?\"\n\nBut waiting for no answer, with the same breath she passed the maid, and\ndeterminately entered the room.\n\nShe sat down by the bed, and met the open eye, but closed and pallid\nmouth of Lucy. She gazed rivetedly and inquisitively a moment; then\nturned a quick aghast look toward Martha, as if seeking warrant for some\nshuddering thought.\n\n\"Miss Lucy\"--said Martha--\"it is your--it is Mrs. Glendinning. Speak to\nher, Miss Lucy.\"\n\nAs if left in the last helpless attitude of some spent contortion of her\ngrief, Lucy was not lying in the ordinary posture of one in bed, but lay\nhalf crosswise upon it, with the pale pillows propping her hueless form,\nand but a single sheet thrown over her, as though she were so heart\noverladen, that her white body could not bear one added feather. And as\nin any snowy marble statue, the drapery clings to the limbs; so as one\nfound drowned, the thin, defining sheet invested Lucy.\n\n\"It is Mrs. Glendinning. Will you speak to her, Miss Lucy?\"\n\nThe thin lips moved and trembled for a moment, and then were still\nagain, and augmented pallor shrouded her.\n\nMartha brought restoratives; and when all was as before, she made a\ngesture for the lady to depart, and in a whisper, said, \"She will not\nspeak to any; she does not speak to me. The doctor has just left--he has\nbeen here five times since morning--and says she must be kept entirely\nquiet.\" Then pointing to the stand, added, \"You see what he has\nleft--mere restoratives. Quiet is her best medicine now, he says. Quiet,\nquiet, quiet! Oh, sweet quiet, wilt thou now ever come?\"\n\n\"Has Mrs. Tartan been written to?\" whispered the lady. Martha nodded.\n\nSo the lady moved to quit the room, saying that once every two hours she\nwould send to know how Lucy fared.\n\n\"But where, where is her aunt, Martha?\" she exclaimed, lowly, pausing at\nthe door, and glancing in sudden astonishment about the room; \"surely,\nsurely, Mrs. Lanyllyn--\"\n\n\"Poor, poor old lady,\" weepingly whispered Martha, \"she hath caught\ninfection from sweet Lucy's woe; she hurried hither, caught one glimpse\nof that bed, and fell like dead upon the floor. The Doctor hath two\npatients now, lady\"--glancing at the bed, and tenderly feeling Lucy's\nbosom, to mark if yet it heaved; \"Alack! Alack! oh, reptile! reptile!\nthat could sting so sweet a breast! fire would be too cold for\nhim--accursed!\"\n\n\"Thy own tongue blister the roof of thy mouth!\" cried Mrs. Glendinning,\nin a half-stifled, whispering scream. \"'Tis not for thee, hired one, to\nrail at my son, though he were Lucifer, simmering in Hell! Mend thy\nmanners, minx!\"\n\nAnd she left the chamber, dilated with her unconquerable pride, leaving\nMartha aghast at such venom in such beauty.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK XIII.\n\nTHEY DEPART THE MEADOWS.\n\n\nI.\n\nIt was just dusk when Pierre approached the Ulver farm-house, in a wagon\nbelonging to the Black Swan Inn. He met his sister shawled and bonneted\nin the porch.\n\n\"Now then, Isabel, is all ready? Where is Delly? I see two most small\nand inconsiderable portmanteaux. Wee is the chest that holds the goods\nof the disowned! The wagon waits, Isabel. Now is all ready? and nothing\nleft?\"\n\n\"Nothing, Pierre; unless in going hence--but I'll not think of that;\nall's fated.\"\n\n\"Delly! where is she? Let us go in for her,\" said Pierre, catching the\nhand of Isabel, and turning rapidly. As he thus half dragged her into\nthe little lighted entry, and then dropping her hand, placed his touch\non the catch of the inner door, Isabel stayed his arm, as if to keep him\nback, till she should forewarn him against something concerning Delly;\nbut suddenly she started herself; and for one instant, eagerly pointing\nat his right hand, seemed almost to half shrink from Pierre.\n\n\"'Tis nothing. I am not hurt; a slight burn--the merest accidental\nscorch this morning. But what's this?\" he added, lifting his hand\nhigher; \"smoke! soot! this comes of going in the dark; sunlight, and I\nhad seen it. But I have not touched thee, Isabel?\"\n\nIsabel lifted her hand and showed the marks.--\"But it came from thee, my\nbrother; and I would catch the plague from thee, so that it should make\nme share thee. Do thou clean thy hand; let mine alone.\"\n\n\"Delly! Delly!\"--cried Pierre--\"why may I not go to her, to bring her\nforth?\"\n\nPlacing her finger upon her lip, Isabel softly opened the door, and\nshowed the object of his inquiry avertedly seated, muffled, on a chair.\n\n\"Do not speak to her, my brother,\" whispered Isabel, \"and do not seek to\nbehold her face, as yet. It will pass over now, ere long, I trust. Come,\nshall we go now? Take Delly forth, but do not speak to her. I have\nbidden all good-by; the old people are in yonder room in the rear; I am\nglad that they chose not to come out, to attend our going forth. Come\nnow, be very quick, Pierre; this is an hour I like not; be it swiftly\npast.\"\n\nSoon all three alighted at the inn. Ordering lights, Pierre led the way\nabove-stairs, and ushered his two companions into one of the two\noutermost rooms of the three adjoining chambers prepared for all.\n\n\"See,\" said he, to the mute and still self-averting figure of\nDelly;--\"see, this is thy room, Miss Ulver; Isabel has told thee all;\nthou know'st our till now secret marriage; she will stay with thee now,\ntill I return from a little business down the street. To-morrow, thou\nknow'st, very early, we take the stage. I may not see thee again till\nthen, so, be steadfast, and cheer up a very little, Miss Ulver, and\ngood-night. All will be well.\"\n\n\nII.\n\nNext morning, by break of day, at four o'clock, the four swift hours\nwere personified in four impatient horses, which shook their trappings\nbeneath the windows of the inn. Three figures emerged into the cool dim\nair and took their places in the coach.\n\nThe old landlord had silently and despondently shaken Pierre by the\nhand; the vainglorious driver was on his box, threadingly adjusting the\nfour reins among the fingers of his buck-skin gloves; the usual thin\ncompany of admiring ostlers and other early on-lookers were gathered\nabout the porch; when--on his companions' account--all eager to cut\nshort any vain delay, at such a painful crisis, Pierre impetuously\nshouted for the coach to move. In a moment, the four meadow-fed young\nhorses leaped forward their own generous lengths, and the four\nresponsive wheels rolled their complete circles; while making vast\nrearward flourishes with his whip, the elated driver seemed as a\nbravado-hero signing his ostentatious farewell signature in the empty\nair. And so, in the dim of the dawn--and to the defiant crackings of\nthat long and sharp-resounding whip, the three forever fled the sweet\nfields of Saddle Meadows.\n\nThe short old landlord gazed after the coach awhile, and then\nre-entering the inn, stroked his gray beard and muttered to himself:--\"I\nhave kept this house, now, three-and-thirty years, and have had plenty\nof bridal-parties come and go; in their long train of wagons,\nbreak-downs, buggies, gigs--a gay and giggling train--Ha!--there's a\npun! popt out like a cork--ay, and once in ox-carts, all garlanded; ay,\nand once, the merry bride was bedded on a load of sweet-scented new-cut\nclover. But such a bridal-party as this morning's--why, it's as sad as\nfunerals. And brave Master Pierre Glendinning is the groom! Well, well,\nwonders is all the go. I thought I had done with wondering when I passed\nfifty; but I keep wondering still. Ah, somehow, now, I feel as though I\nhad just come from lowering some old friend beneath the sod, and yet\nfelt the grating cord-marks in my palms.--'Tis early, but I'll drink.\nLet's see; cider,--a mug of cider;--'tis sharp, and pricks like a\ngame-cock's spur,--cider's the drink for grief. Oh, Lord! that fat men\nshould be so thin-skinned, and suffer in pure sympathy on others'\naccount. A thin-skinned, thin man, he don't suffer so, because there\nain't so much stuff in him for his thin skin to cover. Well, well, well,\nwell, well; of all colics, save me from the melloncholics; green melons\nis the greenest thing!\"\n\n\n\n\nBOOK XIV.\n\nTHE JOURNEY AND THE PAMPHLET.\n\n\nI.\n\nAll profound things, and emotions of things are preceded and attended by\nSilence. What a silence is that with which the pale bride precedes the\nresponsive _I will_, to the priest's solemn question, _Wilt thou have\nthis man for thy husband?_ In silence, too, the wedded hands are\nclasped. Yea, in silence the child Christ was born into the world.\nSilence is the general consecration of the universe. Silence is the\ninvisible laying on of the Divine Pontiff's hands upon the world.\nSilence is at once the most harmless and the most awful thing in all\nnature. It speaks of the Reserved Forces of Fate. Silence is the only\nVoice of our God.\n\nNor is this so august Silence confined to things simply touching or\ngrand. Like the air, Silence permeates all things, and produces its\nmagical power, as well during that peculiar mood which prevails at a\nsolitary traveler's first setting forth on a journey, as at the\nunimaginable time when before the world was, Silence brooded on the face\nof the waters.\n\nNo word was spoken by its inmates, as the coach bearing our young\nEnthusiast, Pierre, and his mournful party, sped forth through the dim\ndawn into the deep midnight, which still occupied, unrepulsed, the\nhearts of the old woods through which the road wound, very shortly after\nquitting the village.\n\nWhen first entering the coach, Pierre had pressed his hand upon the\ncushioned seat to steady his way, some crumpled leaves of paper had met\nhis fingers. He had instinctively clutched them; and the same strange\nclutching mood of his soul which had prompted that instinctive act, did\nalso prevail in causing him now to retain the crumpled paper in his hand\nfor an hour or more of that wonderful intense silence, which the rapid\ncoach bore through the heart of the general stirless morning silence of\nthe fields and the woods.\n\nHis thoughts were very dark and wild; for a space there was rebellion\nand horrid anarchy and infidelity in his soul. This temporary mood may\nbest be likened to that, which--according to a singular story once told\nin the pulpit by a reverend man of God--invaded the heart of an\nexcellent priest. In the midst of a solemn cathedral, upon a cloudy\nSunday afternoon, this priest was in the act of publicly administering\nthe bread at the Holy Sacrament of the Supper, when the Evil One\nsuddenly propounded to him the possibility of the mere moonshine of the\nChristian Religion. Just such now was the mood of Pierre; to him the\nEvil One propounded the possibility of the mere moonshine of all his\nself-renouncing Enthusiasm. The Evil One hooted at him, and called him a\nfool. But by instant and earnest prayer--closing his two eyes, with his\ntwo hands still holding the sacramental bread--the devout priest had\nvanquished the impious Devil. Not so with Pierre. The imperishable\nmonument of his holy Catholic Church; the imperishable record of his\nHoly Bible; the imperishable intuition of the innate truth of\nChristianity;--these were the indestructible anchors which still held\nthe priest to his firm Faith's rock, when the sudden storm raised by the\nEvil One assailed him. But Pierre--where could _he_ find the Church, the\nmonument, the Bible, which unequivocally said to him--\"Go on; thou art\nin the Right; I endorse thee all over; go on.\"--So the difference\nbetween the Priest and Pierre was herein:--with the priest it was a\nmatter, whether certain bodiless thoughts of his were true or not true;\nbut with Pierre it was a question whether certain vital acts of his were\nright or wrong. In this little nut lie germ-like the possible solution\nof some puzzling problems; and also the discovery of additional, and\nstill more profound problems ensuing upon the solution of the former.\nFor so true is this last, that some men refuse to solve any present\nproblem, for fear of making still more work for themselves in that way.\n\nNow, Pierre thought of the magical, mournful letter of Isabel, he\nrecalled the divine inspiration of that hour when the heroic words burst\nfrom his heart--\"Comfort thee, and stand by thee, and fight for thee,\nwill thy leapingly-acknowledging brother!\" These remembrances unfurled\nthemselves in proud exultations in his soul; and from before such\nglorious banners of Virtue, the club-footed Evil One limped away in\ndismay. But now the dread, fateful parting look of his mother came over\nhim; anew he heard the heart-proscribing words--\"Beneath my roof and at\nmy table, he who was once Pierre Glendinning no more puts\nhimself;\"--swooning in her snow-white bed, the lifeless Lucy lay before\nhim, wrapt as in the reverberating echoings of her own agonizing shriek:\n\"My heart! my heart!\" Then how swift the recurrence to Isabel, and the\nnameless awfulness of his still imperfectly conscious, incipient,\nnew-mingled emotion toward this mysterious being. \"Lo! I leave corpses\nwherever I go!\" groaned Pierre to himself--\"Can then my conduct be\nright? Lo! by my conduct I seem threatened by the possibility of a sin\nanomalous and accursed, so anomalous, it may well be the one for which\nScripture says, there is never forgiveness. Corpses behind me, and the\nlast sin before, how then can my conduct be right?\"\n\nIn this mood, the silence accompanied him, and the first visible rays of\nthe morning sun in this same mood found him and saluted him. The\nexcitement and the sleepless night just passed, and the strange\nnarcotic of a quiet, steady anguish, and the sweet quiescence of the\nair, and the monotonous cradle-like motion of the coach over a road made\nfirm and smooth by a refreshing shower over night; these had wrought\ntheir wonted effect upon Isabel and Delly; with hidden faces they leaned\nfast asleep in Pierre's sight. Fast asleep--thus unconscious, oh sweet\nIsabel, oh forlorn Delly, your swift destinies I bear in my own!\n\nSuddenly, as his sad eye fell lower and lower from scanning their\nmagically quiescent persons, his glance lit upon his own clutched hand,\nwhich rested on his knee. Some paper protruded from that clutch. He knew\nnot how it had got there, or whence it had come, though himself had\nclosed his own gripe upon it. He lifted his hand and slowly unfingered\nand unbolted the paper, and unrolled it, and carefully smoothed it, to\nsee what it might be.\n\nIt was a thin, tattered, dried-fish-like thing; printed with blurred ink\nupon mean, sleazy paper. It seemed the opening pages of some ruinous old\npamphlet--a pamphlet containing a chapter or so of some very voluminous\ndisquisition. The conclusion was gone. It must have been accidentally\nleft there by some previous traveler, who perhaps in drawing out his\nhandkerchief, had ignorantly extracted his waste paper.\n\nThere is a singular infatuation in most men, which leads them in odd\nmoments, intermitting between their regular occupations, and when they\nfind themselves all alone in some quiet corner or nook, to fasten with\nunaccountable fondness upon the merest rag of old printed paper--some\nshred of a long-exploded advertisement perhaps--and read it, and study\nit, and reread it, and pore over it, and fairly agonize themselves over\nthis miserable, sleazy paper-rag, which at any other time, or in any\nother place, they would hardly touch with St. Dunstan's long tongs. So\nnow, in a degree, with Pierre. But notwithstanding that he, with most\nother human beings, shared in the strange hallucination above\nmentioned, yet the first glimpse of the title of the dried-fish-like,\npamphlet-shaped rag, did almost tempt him to pitch it out of the window.\nFor, be a man's mood what it may, what sensible and ordinary mortal\ncould have patience for any considerable period, to knowingly hold in\nhis conscious hand a printed document (and that too a very blurred one\nas to ink, and a very sleazy one as to paper), so metaphysically and\ninsufferably entitled as this:--\"Chronometricals & Horologicals?\"\n\nDoubtless, it was something vastly profound; but it is to be observed,\nthat when a man is in a really profound mood, then all merely verbal or\nwritten profundities are unspeakably repulsive, and seem downright\nchildish to him. Nevertheless, the silence still continued; the road ran\nthrough an almost unplowed and uninhabited region; the slumberers still\nslumbered before him; the evil mood was becoming well nigh insupportable\nto him; so, more to force his mind away from the dark realities of\nthings than from any other motive, Pierre finally tried his best to\nplunge himself into the pamphlet.\n\n\nII.\n\nSooner or later in this life, the earnest, or enthusiastic youth comes\nto know, and more or less appreciate this startling solecism:--That\nwhile, as the grand condition of acceptance to God, Christianity calls\nupon all men to renounce this world; yet by all odds the most Mammonish\npart of this world--Europe and America--are owned by none but professed\nChristian nations, who glory in the owning, and seem to have some reason\ntherefor.\n\nThis solecism once vividly and practically apparent; then comes the\nearnest reperusal of the Gospels: the intense self-absorption into that\ngreatest real miracle of all religions, the Sermon on the Mount. From\nthat divine mount, to all earnest loving youths, flows an inexhaustible\nsoul-melting stream of tenderness and loving-kindness; and they leap\nexulting to their feet, to think that the founder of their holy religion\ngave utterance to sentences so infinitely sweet and soothing as these\nsentences which embody all the love of the Past, and all the love which\ncan be imagined in any conceivable Future. Such emotions as that Sermon\nraises in the enthusiastic heart; such emotions all youthful hearts\nrefuse to ascribe to humanity as their origin. This is of God! cries the\nheart, and in that cry ceases all inquisition. Now, with this fresh-read\nsermon in his soul, the youth again gazes abroad upon the world.\nInstantly, in aggravation of the former solecism, an overpowering sense\nof the world's downright positive falsity comes over him; the world\nseems to lie saturated and soaking with lies. The sense of this thing is\nso overpowering, that at first the youth is apt to refuse the evidence\nof his own senses; even as he does that same evidence in the matter of\nthe movement of the visible sun in the heavens, which with his own eyes\nhe plainly sees to go round the world, but nevertheless on the authority\nof other persons,--the Copernican astronomers, whom he never saw--he\nbelieves it _not_ to go round the world, but the world round it. Just\nso, too, he hears good and wise people sincerely say: This world only\n_seems_ to be saturated and soaking with lies; but in reality it does\nnot so lie soaking and saturate; along with some lies, there is much\ntruth in this world. But again he refers to his Bible, and there he\nreads most explicitly, that this world is unconditionally depraved and\naccursed; and that at all hazards men must come out of it. But why come\nout of it, if it be a True World and not a Lying World? Assuredly, then,\nthis world is a lie.\n\nHereupon then in the soul of the enthusiast youth two armies come to the\nshock; and unless he prove recreant, or unless he prove gullible, or\nunless he can find the talismanic secret, to reconcile this world with\nhis own soul, then there is no peace for him, no slightest truce for him\nin this life. Now without doubt this Talismanic Secret has never yet\nbeen found; and in the nature of human things it seems as though it\nnever can be. Certain philosophers have time and again pretended to have\nfound it; but if they do not in the end discover their own delusion,\nother people soon discover it for themselves, and so those philosophers\nand their vain philosophy are let glide away into practical oblivion.\nPlato, and Spinoza, and Goethe, and many more belong to this guild of\nself-impostors, with a preposterous rabble of Muggletonian Scots and\nYankees, whose vile brogue still the more bestreaks the stripedness of\ntheir Greek or German Neoplatonical originals. That profound Silence,\nthat only Voice of our God, which I before spoke of; from that divine\nthing without a name, those impostor philosophers pretend somehow to\nhave got an answer; which is as absurd, as though they should say they\nhad got water out of stone; for how can a man get a Voice out of\nSilence?\n\nCertainly, all must admit, that if for any one this problem of the\npossible reconcilement of this world with our own souls possessed a\npeculiar and potential interest, that one was Pierre Glendinning at the\nperiod we now write of. For in obedience to the loftiest behest of his\nsoul, he had done certain vital acts, which had already lost him his\nworldly felicity, and which he felt must in the end indirectly work him\nsome still additional and not-to-be-thought-of woe.\n\nSoon then, as after his first distaste at the mystical title, and after\nhis then reading on, merely to drown himself, Pierre at last began to\nobtain a glimmering into the profound intent of the writer of the sleazy\nrag pamphlet, he felt a great interest awakened in him. The more he read\nand re-read, the more this interest deepened, but still the more\nlikewise did his failure to comprehend the writer increase. He seemed\nsomehow to derive some general vague inkling concerning it, but the\ncentral conceit refused to become clear to him. The reason whereof is\nnot so easy to be laid down; seeing that the reason-originating heart\nand mind of man, these organic things themselves are not so easily to be\nexpounded. Something, however, more or less to the point, may be\nadventured here.\n\nIf a man be in any vague latent doubt about the intrinsic correctness\nand excellence of his general life-theory and practical course of life;\nthen, if that man chance to light on any other man, or any little\ntreatise, or sermon, which unintendingly, as it were, yet very palpably\nillustrates to him the intrinsic incorrectness and non-excellence of\nboth the theory and the practice of his life; then that man will--more\nor less unconsciously--try hard to hold himself back from the\nself-admitted comprehension of a matter which thus condemns him. For in\nthis case, to comprehend, is himself to condemn himself, which is always\nhighly inconvenient and uncomfortable to a man. Again. If a man be told\na thing wholly new, then--during the time of its first announcement to\nhim--it is entirely impossible for him to comprehend it. For--absurd as\nit may seem--men are only made to comprehend things which they\ncomprehended before (though but in the embryo, as it were). Things new\nit is impossible to make them comprehend, by merely talking to them\nabout it. True, sometimes they pretend to comprehend; in their own\nhearts they really believe they do comprehend; outwardly look as though\nthey _did_ comprehend; wag their bushy tails comprehendingly; but for\nall that, they do not comprehend. Possibly, they may afterward come, of\nthemselves, to inhale this new idea from the circumambient air, and so\ncome to comprehend it; but not otherwise at all. It will be observed,\nthat, neither points of the above speculations do we, in set terms,\nattribute to Pierre in connection with the rag pamphlet. Possibly both\nmight be applicable; possibly neither. Certain it is, however, that at\nthe time, in his own heart, he seemed to think that he did not fully\ncomprehend the strange writer's conceit in all its bearings. Yet was\nthis conceit apparently one of the plainest in the world; so natural, a\nchild might almost have originated it. Nevertheless, again so profound,\nthat scarce Juggularius himself could be the author; and still again so\nexceedingly trivial, that Juggularius' smallest child might well have\nbeen ashamed of it.\n\nSeeing then that this curious paper rag so puzzled Pierre; foreseeing,\ntoo, that Pierre may not in the end be entirely uninfluenced in his\nconduct by the torn pamphlet, when afterwards perhaps by other means he\nshall come to understand it; or, peradventure, come to know that he, in\nthe first place, did--seeing too that the author thereof came to be made\nknown to him by reputation, and though Pierre never spoke to him, yet\nexerted a surprising sorcery upon his spirit by the mere distant glimpse\nof his countenance;--all these reasons I account sufficient apology for\ninserting in the following chapters the initial part of what seems to me\na very fanciful and mystical, rather than philosophical Lecture, from\nwhich, I confess, that I myself can derive no conclusion which\npermanently satisfies those peculiar motions in my soul, to which that\nLecture seems more particularly addressed. For to me it seems more the\nexcellently illustrated re-statement of a problem, than the solution of\nthe problem itself. But as such mere illustrations are almost\nuniversally taken for solutions (and perhaps they are the only possible\nhuman solutions), therefore it may help to the temporary quiet of some\ninquiring mind; and so not be wholly without use. At the worst, each\nperson can now skip, or read and rail for himself.\n\n\nIII.\n\n\"_EI_,\"\n\nBY PLOTINUS PLINLIMMON,\n\n(_In Three Hundred and Thirty-three Lectures._)\n\n\nLECTURE FIRST.\n\nCHRONOMETRICALS AND HOROLOGICALS,\n\n(_Being not to much the Portal, as part of the temporary Scaffold to the\nPortal of this new Philosophy._)\n\n\n\"Few of us doubt, gentlemen, that human life on this earth is but a\nstate of probation; which among other things implies, that here below,\nwe mortals have only to do with things provisional. Accordingly, I hold\nthat all our so-called wisdom is likewise but provisional.\n\n\"This preamble laid down, I begin.\n\n\"It seems to me, in my visions, that there is a certain most rare order\nof human souls, which if carefully carried in the body will almost\nalways and everywhere give Heaven's own Truth, with some small grains of\nvariance. For peculiarly coming from God, the sole source of that\nheavenly truth, and the great Greenwich hill and tower from which the\nuniversal meridians are far out into infinity reckoned; such souls seem\nas London sea-chronometers (_Greek_, time-namers) which as the London\nship floats past Greenwich down the Thames, are accurately adjusted by\nGreenwich time, and if heedfully kept, will still give that same time,\neven though carried to the Azores. True, in nearly all cases of long,\nremote voyages--to China, say--chronometers of the best make, and the\nmost carefully treated, will gradually more or less vary from Greenwich\ntime, without the possibility of the error being corrected by direct\ncomparison with their great standard; but skillful and devout\nobservations of the stars by the sextant will serve materially to lessen\nsuch errors. And besides, there is such a thing as _rating_ a\nchronometer; that is, having ascertained its degree of organic\ninaccuracy, however small, then in all subsequent chronometrical\ncalculations, that ascertained loss or gain can be readily added or\ndeducted, as the case may be. Then again, on these long voyages, the\nchronometer may be corrected by comparing it with the chronometer of\nsome other ship at sea, more recently from home.\n\n\"Now in an artificial world like ours, the soul of man is further\nremoved from its God and the Heavenly Truth, than the chronometer\ncarried to China, is from Greenwich. And, as that chronometer, if at all\naccurate, will pronounce it to be 12 o'clock high-noon, when the China\nlocal watches say, perhaps, it is 12 o'clock midnight; so the\nchronometric soul, if in this world true to its great Greenwich in the\nother, will always, in its so-called intuitions of right and wrong, be\ncontradicting the mere local standards and watch-maker's brains of this\nearth.\n\n\"Bacon's brains were mere watch-maker's brains; but Christ was a\nchronometer; and the most exquisitely adjusted and exact one, and the\nleast affected by all terrestrial jarrings, of any that have ever come\nto us. And the reason why his teachings seemed folly to the Jews, was\nbecause he carried that Heaven's time in Jerusalem, while the Jews\ncarried Jerusalem time there. Did he not expressly say--My wisdom (time)\nis not of this world? But whatever is really peculiar in the wisdom of\nChrist seems precisely the same folly to-day as it did 1850 years ago.\nBecause, in all that interval his bequeathed chronometer has still\npreserved its original Heaven's time, and the general Jerusalem of this\nworld has likewise carefully preserved its own.\n\n\"But though the chronometer carried from Greenwich to China, should\ntruly exhibit in China what the time may be at Greenwich at any moment;\nyet, though thereby it must necessarily contradict China time, it does\nby no means thence follow, that with respect to China, the China watches\nare at all out of the way. Precisely the reverse. For the fact of that\nvariance is a presumption that, with respect to China, the Chinese\nwatches must be all right; and consequently as the China watches are\nright as to China, so the Greenwich chronometers must be wrong as to\nChina. Besides, of what use to the Chinaman would a Greenwich\nchronometer, keeping Greenwich time, be? Were he thereby to regulate his\ndaily actions, he would be guilty of all manner of absurdities:--going\nto bed at noon, say, when his neighbors would be sitting down to dinner.\nAnd thus, though the earthly wisdom of man be heavenly folly to God; so\nalso, conversely, is the heavenly wisdom of God an earthly folly to man.\nLiterally speaking, this is so. Nor does the God at the heavenly\nGreenwich expect common men to keep Greenwich wisdom in this remote\nChinese world of ours; because such a thing were unprofitable for them\nhere, and, indeed, a falsification of Himself, inasmuch as in that case,\nChina time would be identical with Greenwich time, which would make\nGreenwich time wrong.\n\n\"But why then does God now and then send a heavenly chronometer (as a\nmeteoric stone) into the world, uselessly as it would seem, to give the\nlie to all the world's time-keepers? Because he is unwilling to leave\nman without some occasional testimony to this:--that though man's\nChinese notions of things may answer well enough here, they are by no\nmeans universally applicable, and that the central Greenwich in which He\ndwells goes by a somewhat different method from this world. And yet it\nfollows not from this, that God's truth is one thing and man's truth\nanother; but--as above hinted, and as will be further elucidated in\nsubsequent lectures--by their very contradictions they are made to\ncorrespond.\n\n\"By inference it follows, also, that he who finding in himself a\nchronometrical soul, seeks practically to force that heavenly time upon\nthe earth; in such an attempt he can never succeed, with an absolute and\nessential success. And as for himself, if he seek to regulate his own\ndaily conduct by it, he will but array all men's earthly time-keepers\nagainst him, and thereby work himself woe and death. Both these things\nare plainly evinced in the character and fate of Christ, and the past\nand present condition of the religion he taught. But here one thing is\nto be especially observed. Though Christ encountered woe in both the\nprecept and the practice of his chronometricals, yet did he remain\nthroughout entirely without folly or sin. Whereas, almost invariably,\nwith inferior beings, the absolute effort to live in this world\naccording to the strict letter of the chronometricals is, somehow, apt\nto involve those inferior beings eventually in strange, _unique_ follies\nand sins, unimagined before. It is the story of the Ephesian matron,\nallegorized.\n\n\"To any earnest man of insight, a faithful contemplation of these ideas\nconcerning Chronometricals and Horologicals, will serve to render\nprovisionally far less dark some few of the otherwise obscurest things\nwhich have hitherto tormented the honest-thinking men of all ages. What\nman who carries a heavenly soul in him, has not groaned to perceive,\nthat unless he committed a sort of suicide as to the practical things of\nthis world, he never can hope to regulate his earthly conduct by that\nsame heavenly soul? And yet by an infallible instinct he knows, that\nthat monitor can not be wrong in itself.\n\n\"And where is the earnest and righteous philosopher, gentlemen, who\nlooking right and left, and up and down, through all the ages of the\nworld, the present included; where is there such an one who has not a\nthousand times been struck with a sort of infidel idea, that whatever\nother worlds God may be Lord of, he is not the Lord of this; for else\nthis world would seem to give the lie to Him; so utterly repugnant seem\nits ways to the instinctively known ways of Heaven. But it is not, and\ncan not be so; nor will he who regards this chronometrical conceit\naright, ever more be conscious of that horrible idea. For he will then\nsee, or seem to see, that this world's seeming incompatibility with God,\nabsolutely results from its meridianal correspondence with him.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"This chronometrical conceit does by no means involve the justification\nof all the acts which wicked men may perform. For in their wickedness\ndownright wicked men sin as much against their own horologes, as against\nthe heavenly chronometer. That this is so, their spontaneous liability\nto remorse does plainly evince. No, this conceit merely goes to show,\nthat for the mass of men, the highest abstract heavenly righteousness is\nnot only impossible, but would be entirely out of place, and positively\nwrong in a world like this. To turn the left cheek if the right be\nsmitten, is chronometrical; hence, no average son of man ever did such a\nthing. To give _all_ that thou hast to the poor, this too is\nchronometrical; hence no average son of man ever did such a thing.\nNevertheless, if a man gives with a certain self-considerate generosity\nto the poor; abstains from doing downright ill to any man; does his\nconvenient best in a general way to do good to his whole race; takes\nwatchful loving care of his wife and children, relatives, and friends;\nis perfectly tolerant to all other men's opinions, whatever they may be;\nis an honest dealer, an honest citizen, and all that; and more\nespecially if he believe that there is a God for infidels, as well as\nfor believers, and acts upon that belief; then, though such a man falls\ninfinitely short of the chronometrical standard, though all his actions\nare entirely horologic;--yet such a man need never lastingly despond,\nbecause he is sometimes guilty of some minor offense:--hasty words,\nimpulsively returning a blow, fits of domestic petulance, selfish\nenjoyment of a glass of wine while he knows there are those around him\nwho lack a loaf of bread. I say he need never lastingly despond on\naccount of his perpetual liability to these things; because _not_ to do\nthem, and their like, would be to be an angel, a chronometer; whereas,\nhe is a man and a horologe.\n\n\"Yet does the horologe itself teach, that all liabilities to these\nthings should be checked as much as possible, though it is certain they\ncan never be utterly eradicated. They are only to be checked, then,\nbecause, if entirely unrestrained, they would finally run into utter\nselfishness and human demonism, which, as before hinted, are not by any\nmeans justified by the horologe.\n\n\"In short, this Chronometrical and Horological conceit, in sum, seems to\nteach this:--That in things terrestrial (horological) a man must not be\ngoverned by ideas celestial (chronometrical); that certain minor\nself-renunciations in this life his own mere instinct for his own\nevery-day general well-being will teach him to make, but he must by no\nmeans make a complete unconditional sacrifice of himself in behalf of\nany other being, or any cause, or any conceit. (For, does aught else\ncompletely and unconditionally sacrifice itself for him? God's own sun\ndoes not abate one tittle of its heat in July, however you swoon with\nthat heat in the sun. And if it _did_ abate its heat on your behalf,\nthen the wheat and the rye would not ripen; and so, for the incidental\nbenefit of one, a whole population would suffer.)\n\n\"A virtuous expediency, then, seems the highest desirable or attainable\nearthly excellence for the mass of men, and is the only earthly\nexcellence that their Creator intended for them. When they go to heaven,\nit will be quite another thing. There, they can freely turn the left\ncheek, because there the right cheek will never be smitten. There they\ncan freely give all to the poor, for _there_ there will be no poor to\ngive to. A due appreciation of this matter will do good to man. For,\nhitherto, being authoritatively taught by his dogmatical teachers that\nhe must, while on earth, aim at heaven, and attain it, too, in all his\nearthly acts, on pain of eternal wrath; and finding by experience that\nthis is utterly impossible; in his despair, he is too apt to run clean\naway into all manner of moral abandonment, self-deceit, and hypocrisy\n(cloaked, however, mostly under an aspect of the most respectable\ndevotion); or else he openly runs, like a mad dog, into atheism.\nWhereas, let men be taught those Chronometricals and Horologicals, and\nwhile still retaining every common-sense incentive to whatever of virtue\nbe practicable and desirable, and having these incentives strengthened,\ntoo, by the consciousness of powers to attain their mark; then there\nwould be an end to that fatal despair of becoming at all good, which has\ntoo often proved the vice-producing result in many minds of the\nundiluted chronometrical doctrines hitherto taught to mankind. But if\nany man say, that such a doctrine as this I lay down is false, is\nimpious; I would charitably refer that man to the history of Christendom\nfor the last 1800 years; and ask him, whether, in spite of all the\nmaxims of Christ, that history is not just as full of blood, violence,\nwrong, and iniquity of every kind, as any previous portion of the\nworld's story? Therefore, it follows, that so far as practical results\nare concerned--regarded in a purely earthly light--the only great\noriginal moral doctrine of Christianity (_i. e._ the chronometrical\ngratuitous return of good for evil, as distinguished from the\nhorological forgiveness of injuries taught by some of the Pagan\nphilosophers), has been found (horologically) a false one; because after\n1800 years' inculcation from tens of thousands of pulpits, it has proved\nentirely impracticable.\n\n\"I but lay down, then, what the best mortal men do daily practice; and\nwhat all really wicked men are very far removed from. I present\nconsolation to the earnest man, who, among all his human frailties, is\nstill agonizingly conscious of the beauty of chronometrical excellence.\nI hold up a practicable virtue to the vicious; and interfere not with\nthe eternal truth, that, sooner or later, in all cases, downright vice\nis downright woe.\n\n\"Moreover: if----\"\n\nBut here the pamphlet was torn, and came to a most untidy termination.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK XV.\n\nTHE COUSINS.\n\n\nI.\n\nThough resolved to face all out to the last, at whatever desperate\nhazard, Pierre had not started for the city without some reasonable\nplans, both with reference to his more immediate circumstances, and his\nulterior condition.\n\nThere resided in the city a cousin of his, Glendinning Stanly, better\nknown in the general family as Glen Stanly, and by Pierre, as Cousin\nGlen. Like Pierre, he was an only son; his parents had died in his early\nchildhood; and within the present year he had returned from a protracted\nsojourn in Europe, to enter, at the age of twenty-one, into the\nuntrammeled possession of a noble property, which in the hands of\nfaithful guardians, had largely accumulated.\n\nIn their boyhood and earlier adolescence, Pierre and Glen had cherished\na much more than cousinly attachment. At the age of ten, they had\nfurnished an example of the truth, that the friendship of fine-hearted,\ngenerous boys, nurtured amid the romance-engendering comforts and\nelegancies of life, sometimes transcends the bounds of mere boyishness,\nand revels for a while in the empyrean of a love which only comes short,\nby one degree, of the sweetest sentiment entertained between the sexes.\nNor is this boy-love without the occasional fillips and spicinesses,\nwhich at times, by an apparent abatement, enhance the permanent delights\nof those more advanced lovers who love beneath the cestus of Venus.\nJealousies are felt. The sight of another lad too much consorting with\nthe boy's beloved object, shall fill him with emotions akin to those of\nOthello's; a fancied slight, or lessening of the every-day indications\nof warm feelings, shall prompt him to bitter upbraidings and reproaches;\nor shall plunge him into evil moods, for which grim solitude only is\ncongenial.\n\nNor are the letters of Aphroditean devotees more charged with headlong\nvows and protestations, more cross-written and crammed with discursive\nsentimentalities, more undeviating in their semi-weekliness, or\ndayliness, as the case may be, than are the love-friendship missives of\nboys. Among those bundles of papers which Pierre, in an ill hour, so\nfrantically destroyed in the chamber of the inn, were two large packages\nof letters, densely written, and in many cases inscribed crosswise\nthroughout with red ink upon black; so that the love in those letters\nwas two layers deep, and one pen and one pigment were insufficient to\npaint it. The first package contained the letters of Glen to Pierre, the\nother those of Pierre to Glen, which, just prior to Glen's departure for\nEurope, Pierre had obtained from him, in order to re-read them in his\nabsence, and so fortify himself the more in his affection, by reviving\nreference to the young, ardent hours of its earliest manifestations.\n\nBut as the advancing fruit itself extrudes the beautiful blossom, so in\nmany cases, does the eventual love for the other sex forever dismiss the\npreliminary love-friendship of boys. The mere outer friendship may in\nsome degree--greater or less--survive; but the singular love in it has\nperishingly dropped away.\n\nIf in the eye of unyielding reality and truth, the earthly heart of man\ndo indeed ever fix upon some one woman, to whom alone, thenceforth\neternally to be a devotee, without a single shadow of the misgiving of\nits faith; and who, to him, does perfectly embody his finest, loftiest\ndream of feminine loveliness, if this indeed be so--and may Heaven grant\nthat it be--nevertheless, in metropolitan cases, the love of the most\nsingle-eyed lover, almost invariably, is nothing more than the ultimate\nsettling of innumerable wandering glances upon some one specific object;\nas admonished, that the wonderful scope and variety of female\nloveliness, if too long suffered to sway us without decision, shall\nfinally confound all power of selection. The confirmed bachelor is, in\nAmerica, at least, quite as often the victim of a too profound\nappreciation of the infinite charmingness of woman, as made solitary for\nlife by the legitimate empire of a cold and tasteless temperament.\n\nThough the peculiar heart-longings pertaining to his age, had at last\nfound their glowing response in the bosom of Lucy; yet for some period\nprior to that, Pierre had not been insensible to the miscellaneous\npromptings of the passion. So that even before he became a declarative\nlover, Love had yet made him her general votary; and so already there\nhad gradually come a cooling over that ardent sentiment which in earlier\nyears he had cherished for Glen.\n\nAll round and round does the world lie as in a sharp-shooter's ambush,\nto pick off the beautiful illusions of youth, by the pitiless cracking\nrifles of the realities of the age. If the general love for women, had\nin Pierre sensibly modified his particular sentiment toward Glen;\nneither had the thousand nameless fascinations of the then brilliant\nparadises of France and Italy, failed to exert their seductive influence\non many of the previous feelings of Glen. For as the very best\nadvantages of life are not without some envious drawback, so it is among\nthe evils of enlarged foreign travel, that in young and unsolid minds,\nit dislodges some of the finest feelings of the home-born nature;\nreplacing them with a fastidious superciliousness, which like the\nalledged bigoted Federalism of old times would not--according to a\npolitical legend--grind its daily coffee in any mill save of European\nmanufacture, and was satirically said to have thought of importing\nEuropean air for domestic consumption. The mutually curtailed,\nlessening, long-postponed, and at last altogether ceasing letters of\nPierre and Glen were the melancholy attestations of a fact, which\nperhaps neither of them took very severely to heart, as certainly,\nconcerning it, neither took the other to task.\n\nIn the earlier periods of that strange transition from the generous\nimpulsiveness of youth to the provident circumspectness of age, there\ngenerally intervenes a brief pause of unpleasant reconsidering; when\nfinding itself all wide of its former spontaneous self, the soul\nhesitates to commit itself wholly to selfishness; more than repents its\nwanderings;--yet all this is but transient; and again hurried on by the\nswift current of life, the prompt-hearted boy scarce longer is to be\nrecognized in matured man,--very slow to feel, deliberate even in love,\nand statistical even in piety. During the sway of this peculiar period,\nthe boy shall still make some strenuous efforts to retrieve his\ndeparting spontaneities; but so alloyed are all such endeavors with the\nincipiencies of selfishness, that they were best not made at all; since\ntoo often they seem but empty and self-deceptive sallies, or still\nworse, the merest hypocritical assumptions.\n\nUpon the return of Glen from abroad, the commonest courtesy, not to say\nthe blood-relation between them, prompted Pierre to welcome him home,\nwith a letter, which though not over-long, and little enthusiastic,\nstill breathed a spirit of cousinly consideration and kindness,\npervadingly touched by the then naturally frank and all-attractive\nspirit of Pierre. To this, the less earnest and now Europeanized Glen\nhad replied in a letter all sudden suavity; and in a strain of artistic\nartlessness, mourned the apparent decline of their friendship; yet\nfondly trusted that now, notwithstanding their long separation, it\nwould revive with added sincerity. Yet upon accidentally fixing his\nglance upon the opening salutation of this delicate missive, Pierre\nthought he perceived certain, not wholly disguisable chirographic\ntokens, that the \"My very dear Pierre,\" with which the letter seemed to\nhave been begun, had originally been written \"Dear Pierre;\" but that\nwhen all was concluded, and Glen's signature put to it, then the ardent\nwords \"My very\" had been prefixed to the reconsidered \"Dear Pierre;\" a\ncasual supposition, which possibly, however unfounded, materially\nretarded any answering warmth in Pierre, lest his generous flame should\nonly embrace a flaunted feather. Nor was this idea altogether\nunreinforced, when on the reception of a second, and now half-business\nletter (of which mixed sort nearly all the subsequent ones were), from\nGlen, he found that the \"My very dear Pierre\" had already retreated into\n\"My dear Pierre;\" and on a third occasion, into \"Dear Pierre;\" and on a\nfourth, had made a forced and very spirited advanced march up to \"My\ndearest Pierre.\" All of which fluctuations augured ill for the\ndeterminateness of that love, which, however immensely devoted to one\ncause, could yet hoist and sail under the flags of all nations. Nor\ncould he but now applaud a still subsequent letter from Glen, which\nabruptly, and almost with apparent indecorousness, under the\ncircumstances, commenced the strain of friendship without any overture\nof salutation whatever; as if at last, owing to its infinite\ndelicateness, entirely hopeless of precisely defining the nature of\ntheir mystical love, Glen chose rather to leave that precise definition\nto the sympathetical heart and imagination of Pierre; while he himself\nwould go on to celebrate the general relation, by many a sugared\nsentence of miscellaneous devotion. It was a little curious and rather\nsardonically diverting, to compare these masterly, yet not wholly\nsuccessful, and indeterminate tactics of the accomplished Glen, with the\nunfaltering stream of _Beloved Pierres_, which not only flowed along\nthe top margin of all his earlier letters, but here and there, from\ntheir subterranean channel, flashed out in bright intervals, through all\nthe succeeding lines. Nor had the chance recollection of these things at\nall restrained the reckless hand of Pierre, when he threw the whole\npackage of letters, both new and old, into that most honest and summary\nof all elements, which is neither a respecter of persons, nor a finical\ncritic of what manner of writings it burns; but like ultimate Truth\nitself, of which it is the eloquent symbol, consumes all, and only\nconsumes.\n\nWhen the betrothment of Pierre to Lucy had become an acknowledged thing,\nthe courtly Glen, besides the customary felicitations upon that event,\nhad not omitted so fit an opportunity to re-tender to his cousin all his\nprevious jars of honey and treacle, accompanied by additional boxes of\ncandied citron and plums. Pierre thanked him kindly; but in certain\nlittle roguish ambiguities begged leave, on the ground of cloying, to\nreturn him inclosed by far the greater portion of his present; whose\nnon-substantialness was allegorically typified in the containing letter\nitself, prepaid with only the usual postage.\n\nTrue love, as every one knows, will still withstand many repulses, even\nthough rude. But whether it was the love or the politeness of Glen,\nwhich on this occasion proved invincible, is a matter we will not\ndiscuss. Certain it was, that quite undaunted, Glen nobly returned to\nthe charge, and in a very prompt and unexpected answer, extended to\nPierre all the courtesies of the general city, and all the hospitalities\nof five sumptuous chambers, which he and his luxurious environments\ncontrived nominally to occupy in the most fashionable private hotel of a\nvery opulent town. Nor did Glen rest here; but like Napoleon, now seemed\nbent upon gaining the battle by throwing all his regiments upon one\npoint of attack, and gaining that point at all hazards. Hearing of some\nrumor at the tables of his relatives that the day was being fixed for\nthe positive nuptials of Pierre; Glen called all his Parisian\nportfolios for his rosiest sheet, and with scented ink, and a pen of\ngold, indited a most burnished and redolent letter, which, after\ninvoking all the blessings of Apollo and Venus, and the Nine Muses, and\nthe Cardinal Virtues upon the coming event; concluded at last with a\nreally magnificent testimonial to his love.\n\nAccording to this letter, among his other real estate in the city, Glen\nhad inherited a very charming, little, old house, completely furnished\nin the style of the last century, in a quarter of the city which, though\nnow not so garishly fashionable as of yore, still in its quiet\nsecludedness, possessed great attractions for the retired billings and\ncooings of a honeymoon. Indeed he begged leave now to christen it the\nCooery, and if after his wedding jaunt, Pierre would deign to visit the\ncity with his bride for a month or two's sojourn, then the Cooery would\nbe but too happy in affording him a harbor. His sweet cousin need be\nunder no apprehension. Owing to the absence of any fit applicant for it,\nthe house had now long been without a tenant, save an old, confidential,\nbachelor clerk of his father's, who on a nominal rent, and more by way\nof safe-keeping to the house than any thing else, was now hanging up his\nwell-furbished hat in its hall. This accommodating old clerk would\nquickly unpeg his beaver at the first hint of new occupants. Glen would\ncharge himself with supplying the house in advance with a proper retinue\nof servants; fires would be made in the long-unoccupied chambers; the\nvenerable, grotesque, old mahoganies, and marbles, and mirror-frames,\nand moldings could be very soon dusted and burnished; the kitchen was\namply provided with the necessary utensils for cooking; the strong box\nof old silver immemorially pertaining to the mansion, could be readily\ncarted round from the vaults of the neighboring Bank; while the hampers\nof old china, still retained in the house, needed but little trouble to\nunpack; so that silver and china would soon stand assorted in their\nappropriate closets; at the turning of a faucet in the cellar, the best\nof the city's water would not fail to contribute its ingredient to the\nconcocting of a welcoming glass of negus before retiring on the first\nnight of their arrival.\n\nThe over-fastidiousness of some unhealthily critical minds, as well as\nthe moral pusillanimity of others, equally bars the acceptance of\neffectually substantial favors from persons whose motive in proffering\nthem, is not altogether clear and unimpeachable; and toward whom,\nperhaps, some prior coolness or indifference has been shown. But when\nthe acceptance of such a favor would be really convenient and desirable\nto the one party, and completely unattended with any serious distress to\nthe other; there would seem to be no sensible objection to an immediate\nembrace of the offer. And when the acceptor is in rank and fortune the\ngeneral equal of the profferer, and perhaps his superior, so that any\ncourtesy he receives, can be amply returned in the natural course of\nfuture events, then all motives to decline are very materially lessened.\nAnd as for the thousand inconceivable finicalnesses of small pros and\ncons about imaginary fitnesses, and proprieties, and self-consistencies;\nthank heaven, in the hour of heart-health, none such shilly-shallying\nsail-trimmers ever balk the onward course of a bluff-minded man. He\ntakes the world as it is; and carelessly accommodates himself to its\nwhimsical humors; nor ever feels any compunction at receiving the\ngreatest possible favors from those who are as able to grant, as free to\nbestow. He himself bestows upon occasion; so that, at bottom, common\ncharity steps in to dictate a favorable consideration for all possible\nprofferings; seeing that the acceptance shall only the more enrich him,\nindirectly, for new and larger beneficences of his own.\n\nAnd as for those who noways pretend with themselves to regulate their\ndeportment by considerations of genuine benevolence, and to whom such\ncourteous profferings hypocritically come from persons whom they suspect\nfor secret enemies; then to such minds not only will their own worldly\ntactics at once forbid the uncivil blank repulse of such offers; but if\nthey are secretly malicious as well as frigid, or if they are at all\ncapable of being fully gratified by the sense of concealed superiority\nand mastership (which precious few men are) then how delightful for such\npersons under the guise of mere acquiescence in his own voluntary\ncivilities, to make genteel use of their foe. For one would like to\nknow, what were foes made for except to be used? In the rude ages men\nhunted and javelined the tiger, because they hated him for a\nmischief-minded wild-beast; but in these enlightened times, though we\nlove the tiger as little as ever, still we mostly hunt him for the sake\nof his skin. A wise man then will wear his tiger; every morning put on\nhis tiger for a robe to keep him warm and adorn him. In this view, foes\nare far more desirable than friends; for who would hunt and kill his own\nfaithful affectionate dog for the sake of his skin? and is a dog's skin\nas valuable as a tiger's? Cases there are where it becomes soberly\nadvisable, by direct arts to convert some well-wishers into foes. It is\nfalse that in point of policy a man should never make enemies. As\nwell-wishers some men may not only be nugatory but positive obstacles in\nyour peculiar plans; but as foes you may subordinately cement them into\nyour general design.\n\nBut into these ulterior refinements of cool Tuscan policy, Pierre as yet\nhad never become initiated; his experiences hitherto not having been\nvaried and ripe enough for that; besides, he had altogether too much\ngenerous blood in his heart. Nevertheless, thereafter, in a less\nimmature hour, though still he shall not have the heart to practice upon\nsuch maxims as the above, yet shall he have the brain thoroughly to\ncomprehend their practicability; which is not always the case. And\ngenerally, in worldly wisdom, men will deny to one the possession of all\ninsight, which one does not by his every-day outward life practically\nreveal. It is a very common error of some unscrupulously\ninfidel-minded, selfish, unprincipled, or downright knavish men, to\nsuppose that believing men, or benevolent-hearted men, or good men, do\nnot know enough to be unscrupulously selfish, do not know enough to be\nunscrupulous knaves. And thus--thanks to the world!--are there many\nspies in the world's camp, who are mistaken for strolling simpletons.\nAnd these strolling simpletons seem to act upon the principle, that in\ncertain things, we do not so much learn, by showing that already we know\na vast deal, as by negatively seeming rather ignorant. But here we press\nupon the frontiers of that sort of wisdom, which it is very well to\npossess, but not sagacious to show that you possess. Still, men there\nare, who having quite done with the world, all its mere worldly contents\nare become so far indifferent, that they care little of what mere\nworldly imprudence they may be guilty.\n\nNow, if it were not conscious considerations like the really benevolent\nor neutral ones first mentioned above, it was certainly something akin\nto them, which had induced Pierre to return a straightforward, manly,\nand entire acceptance to his cousin of the offer of the house; thanking\nhim, over and over, for his most supererogatory kindness concerning the\npre-engagement of servants and so forth, and the setting in order of the\nsilver and china; but reminding him, nevertheless, that he had\noverlooked all special mention of wines, and begged him to store the\nbins with a few of the very best brands. He would likewise be obliged,\nif he would personally purchase at a certain celebrated grocer's, a\nsmall bag of undoubted Mocha coffee; but Glen need not order it to be\nroasted or ground, because Pierre preferred that both those highly\nimportant and flavor-deciding operations should be performed\ninstantaneously previous to the final boiling and serving. Nor did he\nsay that he would pay for the wines and the Mocha; he contented himself\nwith merely stating the remissness on the part of his cousin, and\npointing out the best way of remedying it.\n\nHe concluded his letter by intimating that though the rumor of a set\nday, and a near one, for his nuptials, was unhappily but ill-founded,\nyet he would not hold Glen's generous offer as merely based upon that\npresumption, and consequently falling with it; but on the contrary,\nwould consider it entirely good for whatever time it might prove\navailable to Pierre. He was betrothed beyond a peradventure; and hoped\nto be married ere death. Meanwhile, Glen would further oblige him by\ngiving the confidential clerk a standing notice to quit.\n\nThough at first quite amazed at this letter,--for indeed, his offer\nmight possibly have proceeded as much from ostentation as any thing\nelse, nor had he dreamed of so unhesitating an acceptance,--Pierre's\ncousin was too much of a precocious young man of the world, disclosedly\nto take it in any other than a very friendly, and cousinly, and\nhumorous, and yet practical way; which he plainly evinced by a reply far\nmore sincere and every way creditable, apparently, both to his heart and\nhead, than any letter he had written to Pierre since the days of their\nboyhood. And thus, by the bluffness and, in some sort,\nuncompunctuousness of Pierre, this very artificial youth was well\nbetrayed into an act of effective kindness; being forced now to drop the\nempty mask of ostentation, and put on the solid hearty features of a\ngenuine face. And just so, are some people in the world to be joked into\noccasional effective goodness, when all coyness, and coolness, all\nresentments, and all solemn preaching, would fail.\n\n\nII.\n\nBut little would we comprehend the peculiar relation between Pierre and\nGlen--a relation involving in the end the most serious results--were\nthere not here thrown over the whole equivocal, preceding account of it,\nanother and more comprehensive equivocalness, which shall absorb all\nminor ones in itself; and so make one pervading ambiguity the only\npossible explanation for all the ambiguous details.\n\nIt had long been imagined by Pierre, that prior to his own special\ndevotion to Lucy, the splendid Glen had not been entirely insensible to\nher surprising charms. Yet this conceit in its incipiency, he knew not\nhow to account for. Assuredly his cousin had never in the slightest\nconceivable hint betrayed it; and as for Lucy, the same intuitive\ndelicacy which forever forbade Pierre to question her on the subject,\ndid equally close her own voluntary lips. Between Pierre and Lucy,\ndelicateness put her sacred signet on this chest of secrecy; which like\nthe wax of an executor upon a desk, though capable of being melted into\nnothing by the smallest candle, for all this, still possesses to the\nreverent the prohibitive virtue of inexorable bars and bolts.\n\nIf Pierre superficially considered the deportment of Glen toward him,\ntherein he could find no possible warrant for indulging the suspicious\nidea. Doth jealousy smile so benignantly and offer its house to the\nbride? Still, on the other hand, to quit the mere surface of the\ndeportment of Glen, and penetrate beneath its brocaded vesture; there\nPierre sometimes seemed to see the long-lurking and yet unhealed wound\nof all a rejected lover's most rankling detestation of a supplanting\nrival, only intensified by their former friendship, and the unimpairable\nblood-relation between them. Now, viewed by the light of this\nmaster-solution, all the singular enigmas in Glen; his capriciousness in\nthe matter of the epistolary--\"Dear Pierres\" and \"Dearest Pierres;\" the\nmercurial fall from the fever-heat of cordiality, to below the Zero of\nindifference; then the contrary rise to fever-heat; and, above all, his\nemphatic redundancy of devotion so soon as the positive espousals of\nPierre seemed on the point of consummation; thus read, all these riddles\napparently found their cunning solution. For the deeper that some men\nfeel a secret and poignant feeling, the higher they pile the belying\nsurfaces. The friendly deportment of Glen then was to be considered as\nin direct proportion to his hoarded hate; and the climax of that hate\nwas evinced in throwing open his house to the bride. Yet if hate was the\nabstract cause, hate could not be the immediate motive of the conduct of\nGlen. Is hate so hospitable? The immediate motive of Glen then must be\nthe intense desire to disguise from the wide world, a fact unspeakably\nhumiliating to his gold-laced and haughty soul: the fact that in the\nprofoundest desire of his heart, Pierre had so victoriously supplanted\nhim. Yet was it that very artful deportment in Glen, which Glen\nprofoundly assumed to this grand end; that consummately artful\ndeportment it was, which first obtruded upon Pierre the surmise, which\nby that identical method his cousin was so absorbedly intent upon\nrendering impossible to him. Hence we here see that as in the negative\nway the secrecy of any strong emotion is exceedingly difficult to be\nkept lastingly private to one's own bosom by any human being; so it is\none of the most fruitless undertakings in the world, to attempt by\naffirmative assumptions to tender to men, the precisely opposite emotion\nas yours. Therefore the final wisdom decrees, that if you have aught\nwhich you desire to keep a secret to yourself, be a Quietist there, and\ndo and say nothing at all about it. For among all the poor chances, this\nis the least poor. Pretensions and substitutions are only the recourse\nof under-graduates in the science of the world; in which science, on his\nown ground, my Lord Chesterfield, is the poorest possible preceptor. The\nearliest instinct of the child, and the ripest experience of age, unite\nin affirming simplicity to be the truest and profoundest part for man.\nLikewise this simplicity is so universal and all-containing as a rule\nfor human life, that the subtlest bad man, and the purest good man, as\nwell as the profoundest wise man, do all alike present it on that side\nwhich they socially turn to the inquisitive and unscrupulous world.\n\n\nIII.\n\nNow the matter of the house had remained in precisely the above-stated\nawaiting predicament, down to the time of Pierre's great\nlife-revolution, the receipt of Isabel's letter. And though, indeed,\nPierre could not but naturally hesitate at still accepting the use of\nthe dwelling, under the widely different circumstances in which he now\nfound himself; and though at first the strongest possible spontaneous\nobjections on the ground of personal independence, pride, and general\nscorn, all clamorously declared in his breast against such a course;\nyet, finally, the same uncompunctuous, ever-adaptive sort of motive\nwhich had induced his original acceptation, prompted him, in the end,\nstill to maintain it unrevoked. It would at once set him at rest from\nall immediate tribulations of mere bed and board; and by affording him a\nshelter, for an indefinite term, enable him the better to look about\nhim, and consider what could best be done to further the permanent\ncomfort of those whom Fate had intrusted to his charge.\n\nIrrespective, it would seem, of that wide general awaking of his\nprofounder being, consequent upon the extraordinary trials he had so\naggregatively encountered of late; the thought was indignantly suggested\nto him, that the world must indeed be organically despicable, if it held\nthat an offer, superfluously accepted in the hour of his abundance,\nshould now, be rejected in that of his utmost need. And without at all\nimputing any singularity of benevolent-mindedness to his cousin, he did\nnot for a moment question, that under the changed aspect of affairs,\nGlen would at least pretend the more eagerly to welcome him to the\nhouse, now that the mere thing of apparent courtesy had become\ntransformed into something like a thing of positive and urgent\nnecessity. When Pierre also considered that not himself only was\nconcerned, but likewise two peculiarly helpless fellow-beings, one of\nthem bound to him from the first by the most sacred ties, and lately\ninspiring an emotion which passed all human precedent in its mixed and\nmystical import; these added considerations completely overthrew in\nPierre all remaining dictates of his vague pride and false independence,\nif such indeed had ever been his.\n\nThough the interval elapsing between his decision to depart with his\ncompanions for the city, and his actual start in the coach, had not\nenabled him to receive any replying word from his cousin; and though\nPierre knew better than to expect it; yet a preparative letter to him he\nhad sent; and did not doubt that this proceeding would prove\nwell-advised in the end.\n\nIn naturally strong-minded men, however young and inexperienced in some\nthings, those great and sudden emergencies, which but confound the timid\nand the weak, only serve to call forth all their generous latentness,\nand teach them, as by inspiration, extraordinary maxims of conduct,\nwhose counterpart, in other men, is only the result of a long,\nvariously-tried and pains-taking life. One of those maxims is, that\nwhen, through whatever cause, we are suddenly translated from opulence\nto need, or from a fair fame to a foul; and straightway it becomes\nnecessary not to contradict the thing--so far at least as the mere\nimputation goes,--to some one previously entertaining high conventional\nregard for us, and from whom we would now solicit some genuine helping\noffices; then, all explanation or palation should be scorned;\npromptness, boldness, utter gladiatorianism, and a defiant non-humility\nshould mark every syllable we breathe, and every line we trace.\n\nThe preparative letter of Pierre to Glen, plunged at once into the very\nheart of the matter, and was perhaps the briefest letter he had ever\nwritten him. Though by no means are such characteristics invariable\nexponents of the predominant mood or general disposition of a man (since\nso accidental a thing as a numb finger, or a bad quill, or poor ink, or\nsqualid paper, or a rickety desk may produce all sorts of\nmodifications), yet in the present instance, the handwriting of Pierre\nhappened plainly to attest and corroborate the spirit of his\ncommunication. The sheet was large; but the words were placarded upon it\nin heavy though rapid lines, only six or eight to the page. And as the\nfootman of a haughty visitor--some Count or Duke--announces the chariot\nof his lord by a thunderous knock on the portal; so to Glen did Pierre,\nin the broad, sweeping, and prodigious superscription of his letter,\nforewarn him what manner of man was on the road.\n\nIn the moment of strong feeling a wonderful condensativeness points the\ntongue and pen; so that ideas, then enunciated sharp and quick as\nminute-guns, in some other hour of unruffledness or unstimulatedness,\nrequire considerable time and trouble to verbally recall.\n\nNot here and now can we set down the precise contents of Pierre's\nletter, without a tautology illy doing justice to the ideas themselves.\nAnd though indeed the dread of tautology be the continual torment of\nsome earnest minds, and, as such, is surely a weakness in them; and\nthough no wise man will wonder at conscientious Virgil all eager at\ndeath to burn his \u00c3\u0086niad for a monstrous heap of inefficient superfluity;\nyet not to dread tautology at times only belongs to those enviable\ndunces, whom the partial God hath blessed, over all the earth, with the\ninexhaustible self-riches of vanity, and folly, and a blind\nself-complacency.\n\nSome rumor of the discontinuance of his betrothment to Lucy Tartan; of\nhis already consummated marriage with a poor and friendless orphan; of\nhis mother's disowning him consequent upon these events; such rumors,\nPierre now wrote to his cousin, would very probably, in the parlors of\nhis city-relatives and acquaintances, precede his arrival in town. But\nhe hinted no word of any possible commentary on these things. He simply\nwent on to say, that now, through the fortune of life--which was but\nthe proverbially unreliable fortune of war--he was, for the present,\nthrown entirely upon his own resources, both for his own support and\nthat of his wife, as well as for the temporary maintenance of a girl,\nwhom he had lately had excellent reason for taking under his especial\nprotection. He proposed a permanent residence in the city; not without\nsome nearly quite settled plans as to the procuring of a competent\nincome, without any ulterior reference to any member of their wealthy\nand widely ramified family. The house, whose temporary occupancy Glen\nhad before so handsomely proffered him, would now be doubly and trebly\ndesirable to him. But the pre-engaged servants, and the old china, and\nthe old silver, and the old wines, and the Mocha, were now become\naltogether unnecessary. Pierre would merely take the place--for a short\ninterval--of the worthy old clerk; and, so far as Glen was concerned,\nsimply stand guardian of the dwelling, till his plans were matured. His\ncousin had originally made his most bounteous overture, to welcome the\ncoming of the presumed bride of Pierre; and though another lady had now\ntaken her place at the altar, yet Pierre would still regard the offer of\nGlen as impersonal in that respect, and bearing equal reference to any\nyoung lady, who should prove her claim to the possessed hand of Pierre.\n\nSince there was no universal law of opinion in such matters, Glen, on\ngeneral worldly grounds, might not consider the real Mrs. Glendinning\naltogether so suitable a match for Pierre, as he possibly might have\nheld numerous other young ladies in his eye: nevertheless, Glen would\nfind her ready to return with sincerity all his cousinly regard and\nattention. In conclusion, Pierre said, that he and his party meditated\nan immediate departure, and would very probably arrive in town in\neight-and-forty hours after the mailing of the present letter. He\ntherefore begged Glen to see the more indispensable domestic appliances\nof the house set in some little order against their arrival; to have\nthe rooms aired and lighted; and also forewarn the confidential clerk of\nwhat he might soon expect. Then, without any tapering sequel\nof--\"_Yours, very truly and faithfully, my dear Cousin Glen_,\" he\nfinished the letter with the abrupt and isolated signature\nof--\"PIERRE.\"\n\n\n\n\nBOOK XVI.\n\nFIRST NIGHT OF THEIR ARRIVAL IN THE CITY.\n\n\nI.\n\nThe stage was belated.\n\nThe country road they traveled entered the city by a remarkably wide and\nwinding street, a great thoroughfare for its less opulent inhabitants.\nThere was no moon and few stars. It was that preluding hour of the night\nwhen the shops are just closing, and the aspect of almost every\nwayfarer, as he passes through the unequal light reflected from the\nwindows, speaks of one hurrying not abroad, but homeward. Though the\nthoroughfare was winding, yet no sweep that it made greatly obstructed\nits long and imposing vista; so that when the coach gained the top of\nthe long and very gradual slope running toward the obscure heart of the\ntown, and the twinkling perspective of two long and parallel rows of\nlamps was revealed--lamps which seemed not so much intended to dispel\nthe general gloom, as to show some dim path leading through it, into\nsome gloom still deeper beyond--when the coach gained this critical\npoint, the whole vast triangular town, for a moment, seemed dimly and\ndespondently to capitulate to the eye.\n\nAnd now, ere descending the gradually-sloping declivity, and just on its\nsummit as it were, the inmates of the coach, by numerous hard, painful\njoltings, and ponderous, dragging trundlings, are suddenly made sensible\nof some great change in the character of the road. The coach seems\nrolling over cannon-balls of all calibers. Grasping Pierre's arm, Isabel\neagerly and forebodingly demands what is the cause of this most strange\nand unpleasant transition.\n\n\"The pavements, Isabel; this is the town.\"\n\nIsabel was silent.\n\nBut, the first time for many weeks, Delly voluntarily spoke:\n\n\"It feels not so soft as the green sward, Master Pierre.\"\n\n\"No, Miss Ulver,\" said Pierre, very bitterly, \"the buried hearts of some\ndead citizens have perhaps come to the surface.\"\n\n\"Sir?\" said Delly.\n\n\"And are they so hard-hearted here?\" asked Isabel.\n\n\"Ask yonder pavements, Isabel. Milk dropt from the milkman's can in\nDecember, freezes not more quickly on those stones, than does snow-white\ninnocence, if in poverty, it chance to fall in these streets.\"\n\n\"Then God help my hard fate, Master Pierre,\" sobbed Delly. \"Why didst\nthou drag hither a poor outcast like me?\"\n\n\"Forgive me, Miss Ulver,\" exclaimed Pierre, with sudden warmth, and yet\nmost marked respect; \"forgive me; never yet have I entered the city by\nnight, but, somehow, it made me feel both bitter and sad. Come, be\ncheerful, we shall soon be comfortably housed, and have our comfort all\nto ourselves; the old clerk I spoke to you about, is now doubtless\nruefully eying his hat on the peg. Come, cheer up, Isabel;--'tis a long\nride, but here we are, at last. Come! 'Tis not very far now to our\nwelcome.\"\n\n\"I hear a strange shuffling and clattering,\" said Delly, with a shudder.\n\n\"It does not seem so light as just now,\" said Isabel.\n\n\"Yes,\" returned Pierre, \"it is the shop-shutters being put on; it is the\nlocking, and bolting, and barring of windows and doors; the\ntown's-people are going to their rest.\"\n\n\"Please God they may find it!\" sighed Delly.\n\n\"They lock and bar out, then, when they rest, do they, Pierre?\" said\nIsabel.\n\n\"Yes, and you were thinking that does not bode well for the welcome I\nspoke of.\"\n\n\"Thou read'st all my soul; yes, I was thinking of that. But whither lead\nthese long, narrow, dismal side-glooms we pass every now and then? What\nare they? They seem terribly still. I see scarce any body in\nthem;--there's another, now. See how haggardly look its criss-cross,\nfar-separate lamps.--What are these side-glooms, dear Pierre; whither\nlead they?\"\n\n\"They are the thin tributaries, sweet Isabel, to the great Oronoco\nthoroughfare we are in; and like true tributaries, they come from the\nfar-hidden places; from under dark beetling secrecies of mortar and\nstone; through the long marsh-grasses of villainy, and by many a\ntransplanted bough-beam, where the wretched have hung.\"\n\n\"I know nothing of these things, Pierre. But I like not the town.\nThink'st thou, Pierre, the time will ever come when all the earth shall\nbe paved?\"\n\n\"Thank God, that never can be!\"\n\n\"These silent side-glooms are horrible;--look! Methinks, not for the\nworld would I turn into one.\"\n\nThat moment the nigh fore-wheel sharply grated under the body of the\ncoach.\n\n\"Courage!\" cried Pierre, \"we are in it!--Not so very solitary either;\nhere comes a traveler.\"\n\n\"Hark, what is that?\" said Delly, \"that keen iron-ringing sound? It\npassed us just now.\"\n\n\"The keen traveler,\" said Pierre, \"he has steel plates to his\nboot-heels;--some tender-souled elder son, I suppose.\"\n\n\"Pierre,\" said Isabel, \"this silence is unnatural, is fearful. The\nforests are never so still.\"\n\n\"Because brick and mortar have deeper secrets than wood or fell, sweet\nIsabel. But here we turn again; now if I guess right, two more turns\nwill bring us to the door. Courage, all will be well; doubtless he has\nprepared a famous supper. Courage, Isabel. Come, shall it be tea or\ncoffee? Some bread, or crisp toast? We'll have eggs, too; and some cold\nchicken, perhaps.\"--Then muttering to himself--\"I hope not that, either;\nno cold collations! there's too much of that in these paving-stones\nhere, set out for the famishing beggars to eat. No. I won't have the\ncold chicken.\" Then aloud--\"But here we turn again; yes, just as I\nthought. Ho, driver!\" (thrusting his head out of the window) \"to the\nright! to the right! it should be on the right! the first house with a\nlight on the right!\"\n\n\"No lights yet but the street's,\" answered the surly voice of the\ndriver.\n\n\"Stupid! he has passed it--yes, yes--he has! Ho! ho! stop; turn back.\nHave you not passed lighted windows?\"\n\n\"No lights but the street's,\" was the rough reply. \"What's the number?\nthe number? Don't keep me beating about here all night! The number, I\nsay!\"\n\n\"I do not know it,\" returned Pierre; \"but I well know the house; you\nmust have passed it, I repeat. You must turn back. Surely you have\npassed lighted windows?\"\n\n\"Then them lights must burn black; there's no lighted windows in the\nstreet; I knows the city; old maids lives here, and they are all to bed;\nrest is warehouses.\"\n\n\"Will you stop the coach, or not?\" cried Pierre, now incensed at his\nsurliness in continuing to drive on.\n\n\"I obeys orders: the first house with a light; and 'cording to my\nreck'ning--though to be sure, I don't know nothing of the city where I\nwas born and bred all my life--no, I knows nothing at all about\nit--'cording to my reck'ning, the first light in this here street will\nbe the watch-house of the ward--yes, there it is--all right! cheap\nlodgings ye've engaged--nothing to pay, and wictuals in.\"\n\nTo certain temperaments, especially when previously agitated by any deep\nfeeling, there is perhaps nothing more exasperating, and which sooner\nexplodes all self-command, than the coarse, jeering insolence of a\nporter, cabman, or hack-driver. Fetchers and carriers of the worst city\ninfamy as many of them are; professionally familiar with the most\nabandoned haunts; in the heart of misery, they drive one of the most\nmercenary of all the trades of guilt. Day-dozers and sluggards on their\nlazy boxes in the sunlight, and felinely wakeful and cat-eyed in the\ndark; most habituated to midnight streets, only trod by sneaking\nburglars, wantons, and debauchees; often in actual pandering league with\nthe most abhorrent sinks; so that they are equally solicitous and\nsuspectful that every customer they encounter in the dark, will prove a\nprofligate or a knave; this hideous tribe of ogres, and Charon ferry-men\nto corruption and death, naturally slide into the most practically\nCalvinistical view of humanity, and hold every man at bottom a fit\nsubject for the coarsest ribaldry and jest; only fine coats and full\npockets can whip such mangy hounds into decency. The least impatience,\nany quickness of temper, a sharp remonstrating word from a customer in a\nseedy coat, or betraying any other evidence of poverty, however minute\nand indirect (for in that pecuniary respect they are the most piercing\nand infallible of all the judgers of men), will be almost sure to\nprovoke, in such cases, their least endurable disdain.\n\nPerhaps it was the unconscious transfer to the stage-driver of some such\nideas as these, which now prompted the highly irritated Pierre to an\nact, which, in a more benignant hour, his better reason would have\nrestrained him from.\n\nHe did not see the light to which the driver had referred; and was\nheedless, in his sudden wrath, that the coach was now going slower in\napproaching it. Ere Isabel could prevent him, he burst open the door,\nand leaping to the pavement, sprang ahead of the horses, and violently\nreined back the leaders by their heads. The driver seized his\nfour-in-hand whip, and with a volley of oaths was about striking out its\nlong, coiling lash at Pierre, when his arm was arrested by a policeman,\nwho suddenly leaping on the stayed coach, commanded him to keep the\npeace.\n\n\"Speak! what is the difficulty here? Be quiet, ladies, nothing serious\nhas happened. Speak you!\"\n\n\"Pierre! Pierre!\" cried the alarmed Isabel. In an instant Pierre was at\nher side by the window; and now turning to the officer, explained to him\nthat the driver had persisted in passing the house at which he was\nordered to stop.\n\n\"Then he shall turn to the right about with you, sir;--in double quick\ntime too; do ye hear? I know you rascals well enough. Turn about, you\nsir, and take the gentleman where he directed.\"\n\nThe cowed driver was beginning a long string of criminating\nexplanations, when turning to Pierre, the policeman calmly desired him\nto re-enter the coach; he would see him safely at his destination; and\nthen seating himself beside the driver on the box, commanded him to tell\nthe number given him by the gentleman.\n\n\"He don't know no numbers--didn't I say he didn't--that's what I got mad\nabout.\"\n\n\"Be still\"--said the officer. \"Sir\"--turning round and addressing Pierre\nwithin; \"where do you wish to go?\"\n\n\"I do not know the number, but it is a house in this street; we have\npassed it; it is, I think, the fourth or fifth house this side of the\nlast corner we turned. It must be lighted up too. It is the small\nold-fashioned dwelling with stone lion-heads above the windows. But make\nhim turn round, and drive slowly, and I will soon point it out.\"\n\n\"Can't see lions in the dark\"--growled the driver--\"lions; ha! ha!\njackasses more likely!\"\n\n\"Look you,\" said the officer, \"I shall see you tightly housed this\nnight, my fine fellow, if you don't cease your jabber. Sir,\" he added,\nresuming with Pierre, \"I am sure there is some mistake here. I perfectly\nwell know now the house you mean. I passed it within the last half-hour;\nall as quiet there as ever. No one lives there, I think; I never saw a\nlight in it. Are you not mistaken in something, then?\"\n\nPierre paused in perplexity and foreboding. Was it possible that Glen\nhad willfully and utterly neglected his letter? Not possible. But it\nmight not have come to his hand; the mails sometimes delayed. Then\nagain, it was not wholly out of the question, that the house was\nprepared for them after all, even though it showed no outward sign. But\nthat was not probable. At any rate, as the driver protested, that his\nfour horses and lumbering vehicle could not turn short round in that\nstreet; and that if he must go back, it could only be done by driving\non, and going round the block, and so retracing his road; and as after\nsuch a procedure, on his part, then in case of a confirmed\ndisappointment respecting the house, the driver would seem warranted, at\nleast in some of his unmannerliness; and as Pierre loathed the villain\naltogether, therefore, in order to run no such risks, he came to a\nsudden determination on the spot.\n\n\"I owe you very much, my good friend,\" said he to the officer, \"for your\ntimely assistance. To be frank, what you have just told me has indeed\nperplexed me not a little concerning the place where I proposed to stop.\nIs there no hotel in this neighborhood, where I could leave these ladies\nwhile I seek my friend?\"\n\nWonted to all manner of deceitfulness, and engaged in a calling which\nunavoidably makes one distrustful of mere appearances, however specious,\nhowever honest; the really good-hearted officer, now eyed Pierre in the\ndubious light with a most unpleasant scrutiny; and he abandoned the\n\"Sir,\" and the tone of his voice sensibly changed, as he\nreplied:--\"There is no hotel in this neighborhood; it is too off the\nthoroughfares.\"\n\n\"Come! come!\"--cried the driver, now growing bold again--\"though you're\nan officer, I'm a citizen for all that. You haven't any further right to\nkeep me out of my bed now. He don't know where he wants to go to, cause\nhe haint got no place at all to go to; so I'll just dump him here, and\nyou dar'n't stay me.\"\n\n\"Don't be impertinent now,\" said the officer, but not so sternly as\nbefore.\n\n\"I'll have my rights though, I tell you that! Leave go of my arm; damn\nye, get off the box; I've the law now. I say mister, come tramp, here\ngoes your luggage,\" and so saying he dragged toward him a light trunk on\nthe top of the stage.\n\n\"Keep a clean tongue in ye now\"--said the officer--\"and don't be in\nquite so great a hurry,\" then addressing Pierre, who had now re-alighted\nfrom the coach--\"Well, this can't continue; what do you intend to do?\"\n\n\"Not to ride further with that man, at any rate,\" said Pierre; \"I will\nstop right here for the present.\"\n\n\"He! he!\" laughed the driver; \"he! he! 'mazing 'commodating now--we\nhitches now, we do--stops right afore the watch-house--he! he!--that's\nfunny!\"\n\n\"Off with the luggage then, driver,\" said the policeman--\"here hand the\nsmall trunk, and now away and unlash there behind.\"\n\nDuring all this scene, Delly had remained perfectly silent in her\ntrembling and rustic alarm; while Isabel, by occasional cries to Pierre,\nhad vainly besought some explanation. But though their complete\nignorance of city life had caused Pierre's two companions to regard the\nscene thus far with too much trepidation; yet now, when in the\nobscurity of night, and in the heart of a strange town, Pierre handed\nthem out of the coach into the naked street, and they saw their luggage\npiled so near the white light of a watch-house, the same ignorance, in\nsome sort, reversed its effects on them; for they little fancied in what\nreally untoward and wretched circumstances they first touched the\nflagging of the city.\n\nAs the coach lumbered off, and went rolling into the wide murkiness\nbeyond, Pierre spoke to the officer.\n\n\"It is a rather strange accident, I confess, my friend, but strange\naccidents will sometimes happen.\"\n\n\"In the best of families,\" rejoined the other, a little ironically.\n\nNow, I must not quarrel with this man, thought Pierre to himself, stung\nat the officer's tone. Then said:--\"Is there any one in your--office?\"\n\n\"No one as yet--not late enough.\"\n\n\"Will you have the kindness then to house these ladies there for the\npresent, while I make haste to provide them with better lodgment? Lead\non, if you please.\"\n\nThe man seemed to hesitate a moment, but finally acquiesced; and soon\nthey passed under the white light, and entered a large, plain, and most\nforbidding-looking room, with hacked wooden benches and bunks ranged\nalong the sides, and a railing before a desk in one corner. The\npermanent keeper of the place was quietly reading a paper by the long\ncentral double bat's-wing gas-light; and three officers off duty were\nnodding on a bench.\n\n\"Not very liberal accommodations\"--said the officer, quietly; \"nor\nalways the best of company, but we try to be civil. Be seated, ladies,\"\npolitely drawing a small bench toward them.\n\n\"Hallo, my friends,\" said Pierre, approaching the nodding three beyond,\nand tapping them on the shoulder--\"Hallo, I say! Will you do me a little\nfavor? Will you help bring some trunks in from the street? I will\nsatisfy you for your trouble, and be much obliged into the bargain.\"\n\nInstantly the three noddies, used to sudden awakenings, opened their\neyes, and stared hard; and being further enlightened by the bat's-wings\nand first officer, promptly brought in the luggage as desired.\n\nPierre hurriedly sat down by Isabel, and in a few words gave her to\nunderstand, that she was now in a perfectly secure place, however\nunwelcoming; that the officers would take every care of her, while he\nmade all possible speed in running to the house, and indubitably\nascertaining how matters stood there. He hoped to be back in less than\nten minutes with good tidings. Explaining his intention to the first\nofficer, and begging him not to leave the girls till he should return,\nhe forthwith sallied into the street. He quickly came to the house, and\nimmediately identified it. But all was profoundly silent and dark. He\nrang the bell, but no answer; and waiting long enough to be certain,\nthat either the house was indeed deserted, or else the old clerk was\nunawakeable or absent; and at all events, certain that no slightest\npreparation had been made for their arrival; Pierre, bitterly\ndisappointed, returned to Isabel with this most unpleasant information.\n\nNevertheless something must be done, and quickly. Turning to one of the\nofficers, he begged him to go and seek a hack, that the whole party\nmight be taken to some respectable lodging. But the man, as well as his\ncomrades, declined the errand on the score, that there was no stand on\ntheir beat, and they could not, on any account, leave their beat. So\nPierre himself must go. He by no means liked to leave Isabel and Delly\nagain, on an expedition which might occupy some time. But there seemed\nno resource, and time now imperiously pressed. Communicating his\nintention therefore to Isabel, and again entreating the officer's\nparticular services as before, and promising not to leave him\nunrequited; Pierre again sallied out. He looked up and down the street,\nand listened; but no sound of any approaching vehicle was audible. He\nran on, and turning the first corner, bent his rapid steps toward the\ngreatest and most central avenue of the city, assured that there, if\nanywhere, he would find what he wanted. It was some distance off; and he\nwas not without hope that an empty hack would meet him ere he arrived\nthere. But the few stray ones he encountered had all muffled fares. He\ncontinued on, and at last gained the great avenue. Not habitually used\nto such scenes, Pierre for a moment was surprised, that the instant he\nturned out of the narrow, and dark, and death-like bye-street, he should\nfind himself suddenly precipitated into the not-yet-repressed noise and\ncontention, and all the garish night-life of a vast thoroughfare,\ncrowded and wedged by day, and even now, at this late hour, brilliant\nwith occasional illuminations, and echoing to very many swift wheels and\nfootfalls.\n\n\nII.\n\n\"I say, my pretty one! Dear! Dear! young man! Oh, love, you are in a\nvast hurry, aint you? Can't you stop a bit, now, my dear: do--there's a\nsweet fellow.\"\n\nPierre turned; and in the flashing, sinister, evil cross-lights of a\ndruggist's window, his eye caught the person of a wonderfully\nbeautifully-featured girl; scarlet-cheeked, glaringly-arrayed, and of a\nfigure all natural grace but unnatural vivacity. Her whole form,\nhowever, was horribly lit by the green and yellow rays from the\ndruggist's.\n\n\"My God!\" shuddered Pierre, hurrying forward, \"the town's first welcome\nto youth!\"\n\nHe was just crossing over to where a line of hacks were drawn up\nagainst the opposite curb, when his eye was arrested by a short, gilded\nname, rather reservedly and aristocratically denominating a large and\nvery handsome house, the second story of which was profusely lighted. He\nlooked up, and was very certain that in this house were the apartments\nof Glen. Yielding to a sudden impulse, he mounted the single step toward\nthe door, and rang the bell, which was quickly responded to by a very\ncivil black.\n\nAs the door opened, he heard the distant interior sound of dancing-music\nand merriment.\n\n\"Is Mr. Stanly in?\"\n\n\"Mr. Stanly? Yes, but he's engaged.\"\n\n\"How?\"\n\n\"He is somewhere in the drawing rooms. My mistress is giving a party to\nthe lodgers.\"\n\n\"Ay? Tell Mr. Stanly I wish to see him for one moment if you please;\nonly one moment.\"\n\n\"I dare not call him, sir. He said that possibly some one might call for\nhim to-night--they are calling every night for Mr. Stanly--but I must\nadmit no one, on the plea of the party.\"\n\nA dark and bitter suspicion now darted through the mind of Pierre; and\nungovernably yielding to it, and resolved to prove or falsify it without\ndelay, he said to the black:\n\n\"My business is pressing. I must see Mr. Stanly.\"\n\n\"I am sorry, sir, but orders are orders: I am his particular servant\nhere--the one that sees his silver every holyday. I can't disobey him.\nMay I shut the door, sir? for as it is, I can not admit you.\"\n\n\"The drawing-rooms are on the second floor, are they not?\" said Pierre\nquietly.\n\n\"Yes,\" said the black pausing in surprise, and holding the door.\n\n\"Yonder are the stairs, I think?\"\n\n\"That way, sir; but this is yours;\" and the now suspicious black was\njust on the point of closing the portal violently upon him, when Pierre\nthrust him suddenly aside, and springing up the long stairs, found\nhimself facing an open door, from whence proceeded a burst of combined\nbrilliancy and melody, doubly confusing to one just emerged from the\nstreet. But bewildered and all demented as he momentarily felt, he\ninstantly stalked in, and confounded the amazed company with his\nunremoved slouched hat, pale cheek, and whole dusty, travel-stained, and\nferocious aspect.\n\n\"Mr. Stanly! where is Mr. Stanly?\" he cried, advancing straight through\na startled quadrille, while all the music suddenly hushed, and every eye\nwas fixed in vague affright upon him.\n\n\"Mr. Stanly! Mr. Stanly!\" cried several bladish voices, toward the\nfurther end of the further drawing-room, into which the first one widely\nopened, \"Here is a most peculiar fellow after you; who the devil is he?\"\n\n\"I think I see him,\" replied a singularly cool, deliberate, and rather\ndrawling voice, yet a very silvery one, and at bottom perhaps a very\nresolute one; \"I think I see him; stand aside, my good fellow, will you;\nladies, remove, remove from between me and yonder hat.\"\n\nThe polite compliance of the company thus addressed, now revealed to the\nadvancing Pierre, the tall, robust figure of a remarkably\nsplendid-looking, and brown-bearded young man, dressed with surprising\nplainness, almost demureness, for such an occasion; but this plainness\nof his dress was not so obvious at first, the material was so fine, and\nadmirably fitted. He was carelessly lounging in a half side-long\nattitude upon a large sofa, and appeared as if but just interrupted in\nsome very agreeable chat with a diminutive but vivacious brunette,\noccupying the other end. The dandy and the man; strength and effeminacy;\ncourage and indolence, were so strangely blended in this superb-eyed\nyouth, that at first sight, it seemed impossible to decide whether there\nwas any genuine mettle in him, or not.\n\nSome years had gone by since the cousins had met; years peculiarly\nproductive of the greatest conceivable changes in the general personal\naspect of human beings. Nevertheless, the eye seldom alters. The instant\ntheir eyes met, they mutually recognized each other. But both did not\nbetray the recognition.\n\n\"Glen!\" cried Pierre, and paused a few steps from him.\n\nBut the superb-eyed only settled himself lower down in his lounging\nattitude, and slowly withdrawing a small, unpretending, and unribboned\nglass from his vest pocket, steadily, yet not entirely insultingly,\nnotwithstanding the circumstances, scrutinized Pierre. Then, dropping\nhis glass, turned slowly round upon the gentlemen near him, saying in\nthe same peculiar, mixed, and musical voice as before:\n\n\"I do not know him; it is an entire mistake; why don't the servants take\nhim out, and the music go on?---- As I was saying, Miss Clara, the\nstatues you saw in the Louvre are not to be mentioned with those in\nFlorence and Rome. Why, there now is that vaunted _chef d'oeuvre_, the\nFighting Gladiator of the Louvre----\"\n\n\"Fighting Gladiator it is!\" yelled Pierre, leaping toward him like\nSpartacus. But the savage impulse in him was restrained by the alarmed\nfemale shrieks and wild gestures around him. As he paused, several\ngentlemen made motions to pinion him; but shaking them off fiercely, he\nstood erect, and isolated for an instant, and fastening his glance upon\nhis still reclining, and apparently unmoved cousin, thus spoke:--\n\n\"Glendinning Stanly, thou disown'st Pierre not so abhorrently as Pierre\ndoes thee. By Heaven, had I a knife, Glen, I could prick thee on the\nspot; let out all thy Glendinning blood, and then sew up the vile\nremainder. Hound, and base blot upon the general humanity!\"\n\n\"This is very extraordinary:--remarkable case of combined imposture and\ninsanity; but where are the servants? why don't that black advance? Lead\nhim out, my good Doc, lead him out. Carefully, carefully! stay\"--putting\nhis hand in his pocket--\"there, take that, and have the poor fellow\ndriven off somewhere.\"\n\nBolting his rage in him, as impossible to be sated by any conduct, in\nsuch a place, Pierre now turned, sprang down the stairs, and fled the\nhouse.\n\n\nIII.\n\n\"Hack, sir? Hack, sir? Hack, sir?\"\n\n\"Cab, sir? Cab, sir? Cab, sir?\"\n\n\"This way, sir! This way, sir! This way, sir!\"\n\n\"He's a rogue! Not him! he's a rogue!\"\n\nPierre was surrounded by a crowd of contending hackmen, all holding long\nwhips in their hands; while others eagerly beckoned to him from their\nboxes, where they sat elevated between their two coach-lamps like\nshabby, discarded saints. The whip-stalks thickened around him, and\nseveral reports of the cracking lashes sharply sounded in his ears. Just\nbursting from a scene so goading as his interview with the scornful Glen\nin the dazzling drawing-room, to Pierre, this sudden tumultuous\nsurrounding of him by whip-stalks and lashes, seemed like the onset of\nthe chastising fiends upon Orestes. But, breaking away from them, he\nseized the first plated door-handle near him, and, leaping into the\nhack, shouted for whoever was the keeper of it, to mount his box\nforthwith and drive off in a given direction.\n\nThe vehicle had proceeded some way down the great avenue when it\npaused, and the driver demanded whither now; what place?\n\n\"The Watch-house of the---- Ward,\" cried Pierre.\n\n\"Hi! hi! Goin' to deliver himself up, hey!\" grinned the fellow to\nhimself--\"Well, that's a sort of honest, any way:--g'lang, you\ndogs!--whist! whee! wha!--g'lang!\"\n\nThe sights and sounds which met the eye of Pierre on re-entering the\nwatch-house, filled him with inexpressible horror and fury. The before\ndecent, drowsy place, now fairly reeked with all things unseemly. Hardly\npossible was it to tell what conceivable cause or occasion had, in the\ncomparatively short absence of Pierre, collected such a base\ncongregation. In indescribable disorder, frantic, diseased-looking men\nand women of all colors, and in all imaginable flaunting, immodest,\ngrotesque, and shattered dresses, were leaping, yelling, and cursing\naround him. The torn Madras handkerchiefs of negresses, and the red\ngowns of yellow girls, hanging in tatters from their naked bosoms, mixed\nwith the rent dresses of deep-rouged white women, and the split coats,\ncheckered vests, and protruding shirts of pale, or whiskered, or\nhaggard, or mustached fellows of all nations, some of whom seemed scared\nfrom their beds, and others seemingly arrested in the midst of some\ncrazy and wanton dance. On all sides, were heard drunken male and female\nvoices, in English, French, Spanish, and Portuguese, interlarded now and\nthen, with the foulest of all human lingoes, that dialect of sin and\ndeath, known as the Cant language, or the Flash.\n\nRunning among this combined babel of persons and voices, several of the\npolice were vainly striving to still the tumult; while others were busy\nhandcuffing the more desperate; and here and there the distracted\nwretches, both men and women, gave downright battle to the officers; and\nstill others already handcuffed struck out at them with their joined\nironed arms. Meanwhile, words and phrases unrepeatable in God's\nsunlight, and whose very existence was utterly unknown, and undreamed\nof by tens of thousands of the decent people of the city; syllables\nobscene and accursed were shouted forth in tones plainly evincing that\nthey were the common household breath of their utterers. The\nthieves'-quarters, and all the brothels, Lock-and-Sin hospitals for\nincurables, and infirmaries and infernoes of hell seemed to have made\none combined sortie, and poured out upon earth through the vile vomitory\nof some unmentionable cellar.\n\nThough the hitherto imperfect and casual city experiences of Pierre illy\nfitted him entirely to comprehend the specific purport of this terrific\nspectacle; still he knew enough by hearsay of the more infamous life of\nthe town, to imagine from whence, and who, were the objects before him.\nBut all his consciousness at the time was absorbed by the one horrified\nthought of Isabel and Delly, forced to witness a sight hardly endurable\nfor Pierre himself; or, possibly, sucked into the tumult, and in close\npersonal contact with its loathsomeness. Rushing into the crowd,\nregardless of the random blows and curses he encountered, he wildly\nsought for Isabel, and soon descried her struggling from the delirious\nreaching arms of a half-clad reeling whiskerando. With an immense blow\nof his mailed fist, he sent the wretch humming, and seizing Isabel,\ncried out to two officers near, to clear a path for him to the door.\nThey did so. And in a few minutes the panting Isabel was safe in the\nopen air. He would have stayed by her, but she conjured him to return\nfor Delly, exposed to worse insults than herself. An additional posse of\nofficers now approaching, Pierre committing her to the care of one of\nthem, and summoning two others to join himself, now re-entered the room.\nIn another quarter of it, he saw Delly seized on each hand by two\nbleared and half-bloody women, who with fiendish grimaces were\nironically twitting her upon her close-necked dress, and had already\nstript her handkerchief from her. She uttered a cry of mixed anguish\nand joy at the sight of him; and Pierre soon succeeded in returning with\nher to Isabel.\n\nDuring the absence of Pierre in quest of the hack, and while Isabel and\nDelly were quietly awaiting his return, the door had suddenly burst\nopen, and a detachment of the police drove in, and caged, the entire\nmiscellaneous night-occupants of a notorious stew, which they had\nstormed and carried during the height of some outrageous orgie. The\nfirst sight of the interior of the watch-house, and their being so\nquickly huddled together within its four blank walls, had suddenly\nlashed the mob into frenzy; so that for the time, oblivious of all other\nconsiderations, the entire force of the police was directed to the\nquelling of the in-door riot; and consequently, abandoned to their own\nprotection, Isabel and Delly had been temporarily left to its mercy.\n\nIt was no time for Pierre to manifest his indignation at the\nofficer--even if he could now find him--who had thus falsified his\nindividual pledge concerning the precious charge committed to him. Nor\nwas it any time to distress himself about his luggage, still somewhere\nwithin. Quitting all, he thrust the bewildered and half-lifeless girls\ninto the waiting hack, which, by his orders, drove back in the direction\nof the stand, where Pierre had first taken it up.\n\nWhen the coach had rolled them well away from the tumult, Pierre stopped\nit, and said to the man, that he desired to be taken to the nearest\nrespectable hotel or boarding-house of any kind, that he knew of. The\nfellow--maliciously diverted by what had happened thus far--made some\nambiguous and rudely merry rejoinder. But warned by his previous rash\nquarrel with the stage-driver, Pierre passed this unnoticed, and in a\ncontrolled, calm, decided manner repeated his directions.\n\nThe issue was, that after a rather roundabout drive they drew up in a\nvery respectable side-street, before a large respectable-looking house,\nilluminated by two tall white lights flanking its portico. Pierre was\nglad to notice some little remaining stir within, spite of the\ncomparative lateness of the hour. A bare-headed, tidily-dressed, and\nvery intelligent-looking man, with a broom clothes-brush in his hand,\nappearing, scrutinized him rather sharply at first; but as Pierre\nadvanced further into the light, and his countenance became visible, the\nman, assuming a respectful but still slightly perplexed air, invited the\nwhole party into a closely adjoining parlor, whose disordered chairs and\ngeneral dustiness, evinced that after a day's activity it now awaited\nthe morning offices of the housemaids.\n\n\"Baggage, sir?\"\n\n\"I have left my baggage at another place,\" said Pierre, \"I shall send\nfor it to-morrow.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" exclaimed the very intelligent-looking man, rather dubiously,\n\"shall I discharge the hack, then?\"\n\n\"Stay,\" said Pierre, bethinking him, that it would be well not to let\nthe man know from whence they had last come, \"I will discharge it\nmyself, thank you.\"\n\nSo returning to the sidewalk, without debate, he paid the hackman an\nexorbitant fare, who, anxious to secure such illegal gains beyond all\nhope of recovery, quickly mounted his box and drove off at a gallop.\n\n\"Will you step into the office, sir, now?\" said the man, slightly\nflourishing with his brush--\"this way, sir, if you please.\"\n\nPierre followed him, into an almost deserted, dimly lit room with a\nstand in it. Going behind the stand, the man turned round to him a large\nledger-like book, thickly inscribed with names, like any directory, and\noffered him a pen ready dipped in ink.\n\nUnderstanding the general hint, though secretly irritated at something\nin the manner of the man, Pierre drew the book to him, and wrote in a\nfirm hand, at the bottom of the last-named column,--\n\n\"Mr. and Mrs. Pierre Glendinning, and Miss Ulver.\"\n\nThe man glanced at the writing inquiringly, and then said--\"The other\ncolumn, sir--where from.\"\n\n\"True,\" said Pierre, and wrote \"Saddle Meadows.\"\n\nThe very intelligent-looking man re-examined the page, and then slowly\nstroking his shaven chin, with a fork, made of his thumb for one tine,\nand his united four fingers for the other, said softly and\nwhisperingly--\"Anywheres in this country, sir?\"\n\n\"Yes, in the country,\" said Pierre, evasively, and bridling his ire.\n\"But now show me to two chambers, will you; the one for myself and wife,\nI desire to have opening into another, a third one, never mind how\nsmall; but I must have a dressing-room.\"\n\n\"Dressing-room,\" repeated the man, in an ironically deliberative\nvoice--\"Dressing-room;--Hem!--You will have your luggage taken into the\ndressing-room, then, I suppose.--Oh, I forgot--your luggage aint come\nyet--ah, yes, yes, yes--luggage is coming to-morrow--Oh, yes,\nyes,--certainly--to-morrow--of course. By the way, sir; I dislike to\nseem at all uncivil, and I am sure you will not deem me so; but--\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Pierre, mustering all his self-command for the coming\nimpertinence.\n\n\"When stranger gentlemen come to this house without luggage, we think\nourselves bound to ask them to pay their bills in advance, sir; that is\nall, sir.\"\n\n\"I shall stay here to-night and the whole of to-morrow, at any rate,\"\nrejoined Pierre, thankful that this was all; \"how much will it be?\" and\nhe drew out his purse.\n\nThe man's eyes fastened with eagerness on the purse; he looked from it\nto the face of him who held it; then seemed half hesitating an instant;\nthen brightening up, said, with sudden suavity--\"Never mind, sir, never\nmind, sir; though rogues sometimes be gentlemanly; gentlemen that are\ngentlemen never go abroad without their diplomas. Their diplomas are\ntheir friends; and their only friends are their dollars; you have a\npurse-full of friends.--We have chambers, sir, that will exactly suit\nyou, I think. Bring your ladies and I will show you up to them\nimmediately.\" So saying, dropping his brush, the very\nintelligent-looking man lighted one lamp, and taking two unlighted ones\nin his other hand, led the way down the dusky lead-sheeted hall, Pierre\nfollowing him with Isabel and Delly.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK XVII.\n\nYOUNG AMERICA IN LITERATURE.\n\n\nI.\n\nAmong the various conflicting modes of writing history, there would seem\nto be two grand practical distinctions, under which all the rest must\nsubordinately range. By the one mode, all contemporaneous circumstances,\nfacts, and events must be set down contemporaneously; by the other, they\nare only to be set down as the general stream of the narrative shall\ndictate; for matters which are kindred in time, may be very irrelative\nin themselves. I elect neither of these; I am careless of either; both\nare well enough in their way; I write precisely as I please.\n\nIn the earlier chapters of this volume, it has somewhere been passingly\nintimated, that Pierre was not only a reader of the poets and other fine\nwriters, but likewise--and what is a very different thing from the\nother--a thorough allegorical understander of them, a profound emotional\nsympathizer with them; in other words, Pierre himself possessed the\npoetic nature; in himself absolutely, though but latently and\nfloatingly, possessed every whit of the imaginative wealth which he so\nadmired, when by vast pains-takings, and all manner of unrecompensed\nagonies, systematized on the printed page. Not that as yet his young and\nimmature soul had been accosted by the Wonderful Mutes, and through the\nvast halls of Silent Truth, had been ushered into the full, secret,\neternally inviolable Sanhedrim, where the Poetic Magi discuss, in\nglorious gibberish, the Alpha and Omega of the Universe. But among the\nbeautiful imaginings of the second and third degree of poets, he freely\nand comprehendingly ranged.\n\nBut it still remains to be said, that Pierre himself had written many a\nfugitive thing, which had brought him, not only vast credit and\ncompliments from his more immediate acquaintances, but the less partial\napplauses of the always intelligent, and extremely discriminating\npublic. In short, Pierre had frequently done that, which many other boys\nhave done--published. Not in the imposing form of a book, but in the\nmore modest and becoming way of occasional contributions to magazines\nand other polite periodicals. His magnificent and victorious _debut_ had\nbeen made in that delightful love-sonnet, entitled \"The Tropical\nSummer.\" Not only the public had applauded his gemmed little sketches of\nthought and fancy, whether in poetry or prose; but the high and mighty\nCampbell clan of editors of all sorts had bestowed upon him those\ngenerous commendations, which, with one instantaneous glance, they had\nimmediately perceived was his due. They spoke in high terms of his\nsurprising command of language; they begged to express their wonder at\nhis euphonious construction of sentences; they regarded with reverence\nthe pervading symmetry of his general style. But transcending even this\nprofound insight into the deep merits of Pierre, they looked infinitely\nbeyond, and confessed their complete inability to restrain their\nunqualified admiration for the highly judicious smoothness and\ngenteelness of the sentiments and fancies expressed. \"This writer,\" said\none,--in an ungovernable burst of admiring fury--\"is characterized\nthroughout by Perfect Taste.\" Another, after endorsingly quoting that\nsapient, suppressed maxim of Dr. Goldsmith's, which asserts that\nwhatever is new is false, went on to apply it to the excellent\nproductions before him; concluding with this: \"He has translated the\nunruffled gentleman from the drawing-room into the general levee of\nletters; he never permits himself to astonish; is never betrayed into\nany thing coarse or new; as assured that whatever astonishes is vulgar,\nand whatever is new must be crude. Yes, it is the glory of this\nadmirable young author, that vulgarity and vigor--two inseparable\nadjuncts--are equally removed from him.\"\n\nA third, perorated a long and beautifully written review, by the bold\nand startling announcement--\"This writer is unquestionably a highly\nrespectable youth.\"\n\nNor had the editors of various moral and religious periodicals failed to\nrender the tribute of their severer appreciation, and more enviable,\nbecause more chary applause. A renowned clerical and philological\nconductor of a weekly publication of this kind, whose surprising\nproficiency in the Greek, Hebrew, and Chaldaic, to which he had devoted\nby far the greater part of his life, peculiarly fitted him to pronounce\nunerring judgment upon works of taste in the English, had unhesitatingly\ndelivered himself thus:--\"He is blameless in morals, and harmless\nthroughout.\" Another, had unhesitatingly recommended his effusions to\nthe family-circle. A third, had no reserve in saying, that the\npredominant end and aim of this author was evangelical piety.\n\nA mind less naturally strong than Pierre's might well have been hurried\ninto vast self-complacency, by such eulogy as this, especially as there\ncould be no possible doubt, that the primitive verdict pronounced by the\neditors was irreversible, except in the highly improbable event of the\nnear approach of the Millennium, which might establish a different\ndynasty of taste, and possibly eject the editors. It is true, that in\nview of the general practical vagueness of these panegyrics, and the\ncircumstance that, in essence, they were all somehow of the prudently\nindecisive sort; and, considering that they were panegyrics, and nothing\nbut panegyrics, without any thing analytical about them; an elderly\nfriend of a literary turn, had made bold to say to our hero--\"Pierre,\nthis is very high praise, I grant, and you are a surprisingly young\nauthor to receive it; but I do not see any criticisms as yet.\"\n\n\"Criticisms?\" cried Pierre, in amazement; \"why, sir, they are all\ncriticisms! I am the idol of the critics!\"\n\n\"Ah!\" sighed the elderly friend, as if suddenly reminded that that was\ntrue after all--\"Ah!\" and went on with his inoffensive, non-committal\ncigar.\n\nNevertheless, thanks to the editors, such at last became the popular\nliterary enthusiasm in behalf of Pierre, that two young men, recently\nabandoning the ignoble pursuit of tailoring for the more honorable trade\nof the publisher (probably with an economical view of working up in\nbooks, the linen and cotton shreds of the cutter's counter, after having\nbeen subjected to the action of the paper-mill), had on the daintiest\nscolloped-edged paper, and in the neatest possible, and fine-needle-work\nhand, addressed him a letter, couched in the following terms; the\ngeneral style of which letter will sufficiently evince that,\nthough--thanks to the manufacturer--their linen and cotton shreds may\nhave been very completely transmuted into paper, yet the cutters\nthemselves were not yet entirely out of the metamorphosing mill.\n\n\n     \"Hon. Pierre Glendinning,\n     \"Revered Sir,\n\n     \"The fine cut, the judicious fit of your productions fill us with\n     amazement. The fabric is excellent--the finest broadcloth of\n     genius.

For though you are\n     young in age, you are old in fame and ability. I can not express to\n     you my ardent admiration of your works; nor can I but deeply regret\n     that the productions of such graphic descriptive power, should be\n     unaccompanied by the humbler illustrative labors of the designer.\n     My services in this line are entirely at your command. I need not\n     say how proud I should be, if this hint, on my part, however\n     presuming, should induce you to reply in terms upon which I could\n     found the hope of honoring myself and my profession by a few\n     designs for the works of the illustrious Glendinning. But the\n     cursory mention of your name here fills me with such swelling\n     emotions, that I can say nothing more. I would only add, however,\n     that not being at all connected with the Trade, my business\n     situation unpleasantly forces me to make cash down on delivery of\n     each design, the basis of all my professional arrangements. Your\n     noble soul, however, would disdain to suppose, that this sordid\n     necessity, in my merely business concerns, could ever impair----\n\n    \"That profound private veneration and admiration\n        With which I unmercenarily am,\n             Great and good Glendinning,\n                  Yours most humbly,\n                         PETER PENCE.\"\n\n\nII.\n\nThese were stirring letters. The Library Form! an Illustrated Edition!\nHis whole heart swelled.\n\nBut unfortunately it occurred to Pierre, that as all his writings were\nnot only fugitive, but if put together could not possibly fill more than\na very small duodecimo; therefore the Library Edition seemed a little\npremature, perhaps; possibly, in a slight degree, preposterous. Then, as\nthey were chiefly made up of little sonnets, brief meditative poems, and\nmoral essays, the matter for the designer ran some small risk of being\nbut meager. In his inexperience, he did not know that such was the great\nheight of invention to which the designer's art had been carried, that\ncertain gentlemen of that profession had gone to an eminent\npublishing-house with overtures for an illustrated edition of \"Coke upon\nLyttleton.\" Even the City Directory was beautifully illustrated with\nexquisite engravings of bricks, tongs, and flat-irons.\n\nConcerning the draught for the title-page, it must be confessed, that on\nseeing the imposing enumeration of his titles--long and magnificent as\nthose preceding the proclamations of some German Prince (\"_Hereditary\nLord of the back-yard of Crantz Jacobi; Undoubted Proprietor by Seizure\nof the bedstead of the late Widow Van Lorn; Heir Apparent to the\nBankrupt Bakery of Fletz and Flitz; Residuary Legatee of the Confiscated\nPin-Money of the Late Dowager Dunker; &c. &c. &c._\") Pierre could not\nentirely repress a momentary feeling of elation. Yet did he also bow low\nunder the weight of his own ponderosity, as the author of such a vast\nload of literature. It occasioned him some slight misgivings, however,\nwhen he considered, that already in his eighteenth year, his title-page\nshould so immensely surpass in voluminous statisticals the simple page,\nwhich in his father's edition prefixed the vast speculations of Plato.\nStill, he comforted himself with the thought, that as he could not\npresume to interfere with the bill-stickers of the Gazelle Magazine, who\nevery month covered the walls of the city with gigantic announcements of\nhis name among the other contributors; so neither could he now--in the\nhighly improbable event of closing with the offer of Messrs. Wonder and\nWen--presume to interfere with the bill-sticking department of their\nbusiness concern; for it was plain that they esteemed one's title-page\nbut another unwindowed wall, infinitely more available than most walls,\nsince here was at least one spot in the city where no rival\nbill-stickers dared to encroach. Nevertheless, resolved as he was to let\nall such bill-sticking matters take care of themselves, he was sensible\nof some coy inclination toward that modest method of certain kid-gloved\nand dainty authors, who scorning the vulgarity of a sounding parade,\ncontented themselves with simply subscribing their name to the\ntitle-page; as confident, that that was sufficient guarantee to the\nnotice of all true gentlemen of taste. It was for petty German princes\nto sound their prolonged titular flourishes. The Czar of Russia\ncontented himself with putting the simple word \"NICHOLAS\" to his\nloftiest decrees.\n\nThis train of thought terminated at last in various considerations upon\nthe subject of anonymousness in authorship. He regretted that he had not\nstarted his literary career under that mask. At present, it might be too\nlate; already the whole universe knew him, and it was in vain at this\nlate day to attempt to hood himself. But when he considered the\nessential dignity and propriety at all points, of the inviolably\nanonymous method, he could not but feel the sincerest sympathy for those\nunfortunate fellows, who, not only naturally averse to any sort of\npublicity, but progressively ashamed of their own successive\nproductions--written chiefly for the merest cash--were yet cruelly\ncoerced into sounding title-pages by sundry baker's and butcher's bills,\nand other financial considerations; inasmuch as the placard of the\ntitle-page indubitably must assist the publisher in his sales.\n\nBut perhaps the ruling, though not altogether conscious motive of Pierre\nin finally declining--as he did--the services of Messrs. Wonder and Wen,\nthose eager applicants for the privilege of extending and solidifying\nhis fame, arose from the idea that being at this time not very far\nadvanced in years, the probability was, that his future productions\nmight at least equal, if not surpass, in some small degree, those\nalready given to the world. He resolved to wait for his literary\ncanonization until he should at least have outgrown the sophomorean\ninsinuation of the Law; which, with a singular affectation of benignity,\npronounced him an \"infant.\" His modesty obscured from him the\ncircumstance, that the greatest lettered celebrities of the time, had,\nby the divine power of genius, become full graduates in the University\nof Fame, while yet as legal minors forced to go to their mammas for\npennies wherewith to keep them in peanuts.\n\nNot seldom Pierre's social placidity was ruffled by polite entreaties\nfrom the young ladies that he would be pleased to grace their Albums\nwith some nice little song. We say that here his social placidity was\nruffled; for the true charm of agreeable parlor society is, that there\nyou lose your own sharp individuality and become delightfully merged in\nthat soft social Pantheism, as it were, that rosy melting of all into\none, ever prevailing in those drawing-rooms, which pacifically and\ndeliciously belie their own name; inasmuch as there no one draws the\nsword of his own individuality, but all such ugly weapons are left--as\nof old--with your hat and cane in the hall. It was very awkward to\ndecline the albums; but somehow it was still worse, and peculiarly\ndistasteful for Pierre to comply. With equal justice apparently, you\nmight either have called this his weakness or his idiosyncrasy. He\nsummoned all his suavity, and refused. And the refusal of\nPierre--according to Miss Angelica Amabilia of Ambleside--was sweeter\nthan the compliance of others. But then--prior to the proffer of her\nalbum--in a copse at Ambleside, Pierre in a gallant whim had in the\nlady's own presence voluntarily carved Miss Angelica's initials upon the\nbark of a beautiful maple. But all young ladies are not Miss Angelicas.\nBlandly denied in the parlor, they courted repulse in the study. In\nlovely envelopes they dispatched their albums to Pierre, not omitting\nto drop a little attar-of-rose in the palm of the domestic who carried\nthem. While now Pierre--pushed to the wall in his\ngallantry--shilly-shallied as to what he must do, the awaiting albums\nmultiplied upon him; and by-and-by monopolized an entire shelf in his\nchamber; so that while their combined ornate bindings fairly dazzled his\neyes, their excessive redolence all but made him to faint, though\nindeed, in moderation, he was very partial to perfumes. So that of\nreally chilly afternoons, he was still obliged to drop the upper sashes\na few inches.\n\nThe simplest of all things it is to write in a lady's album. But Cui\nBono? Is there such a dearth of printed reading, that the monkish times\nmust be revived, and ladies books be in manuscript? What could Pierre\nwrite of his own on Love or any thing else, that would surpass what\ndivine Hafiz wrote so many long centuries ago? Was there not Anacreon\ntoo, and Catullus, and Ovid--all translated, and readily accessible? And\nthen--bless all their souls!--had the dear creatures forgotten Tom\nMoore? But the handwriting, Pierre,--they want the sight of your hand.\nWell, thought Pierre, actual feeling is better than transmitted sight,\nany day. I will give them the actual feeling of my hand, as much as they\nwant. And lips are still better than hands. Let them send their sweet\nfaces to me, and I will kiss _lipographs_ upon them forever and a day.\nThis was a felicitous idea. He called Dates, and had the albums carried\ndown by the basket-full into the dining-room. He opened and spread them\nall out upon the extension-table there; then, modeling himself by the\nPope, when His Holiness collectively blesses long crates of rosaries--he\nwaved one devout kiss to the albums; and summoning three servants sent\nthe albums all home, with his best compliments, accompanied with a\nconfectioner's _kiss_ for each album, rolled up in the most ethereal\ntissue.\n\nFrom various quarters of the land, both town and country, and\nespecially during the preliminary season of autumn, Pierre received\nvarious pressing invitations to lecture before Lyceums, Young Men's\nAssociations, and other Literary and Scientific Societies. The letters\nconveying these invitations possessed quite an imposing and most\nflattering aspect to the unsophisticated Pierre. One was as follows:--\n\n     \"_Urquhartian Club for the Immediate Extension of the Limits of all\n     Knowledge, both Human and Divine._\n\n     \"ZADOCKPRATTSVILLE,\n     \"_June 11th, 18--_.\n\n     \"_Author of the 'Tropical Summer,' &c._\n     \"HONORED AND DEAR SIR:--\n\n     \"Official duty and private inclination in this present case most\n     delightfully blend. What was the ardent desire of my heart, has now\n     by the action of the _Committee on Lectures_ become professionally\n     obligatory upon me. As Chairman of our _Committee on Lectures_, I\n     hereby beg the privilege of entreating that you will honor this\n     Society by lecturing before it on any subject you may choose, and\n     at any day most convenient to yourself. The subject of Human\n     Destiny we would respectfully suggest, without however at all\n     wishing to impede you in your own unbiased selection.\n\n     \"If you honor us by complying with this invitation, be assured,\n     sir, that the Committee on Lectures will take the best care of you\n     throughout your stay, and endeavor to make Zadockprattsville\n     agreeable to you. A carriage will be in attendance at the\n     Stage-house to convey yourself and luggage to the Inn, under full\n     escort of the _Committee on Lectures_, with the Chairman at their\n     head.\n\n    \"Permit me to join my private homage\n             To my high official consideration for you,\n                   And to subscribe myself\n                      Very humbly your servant,\n                            DONALD DUNDONALD.\"\n\n\nIII.\n\nBut it was more especially the Lecture invitations coming from\nvenerable, gray-headed metropolitan Societies, and indited by venerable\ngray-headed Secretaries, which far from elating filled the youthful\nPierre with the sincerest sense of humility. Lecture? lecture? such a\nstripling as I lecture to fifty benches, with ten gray heads on each?\nfive hundred gray heads in all! Shall my one, poor, inexperienced brain\npresume to lay down the law in a lecture to five hundred life-ripened\nunderstandings? It seemed too absurd for thought. Yet the five hundred,\nthrough their spokesman, had voluntarily extended this identical\ninvitation to him. Then how could it be otherwise, than that an\nincipient Timonism should slide into Pierre, when he considered all the\ndisgraceful inferences to be derived from such a fact. He called to\nmind, how that once upon a time, during a visit of his to the city, the\npolice were called out to quell a portentous riot, occasioned by the\nvast press and contention for seats at the first lecture of an\nillustrious lad of nineteen, the author of \"A Week at Coney Island.\"\n\nIt is needless to say that Pierre most conscientiously and respectfully\ndeclined all polite overtures of this sort.\n\nSimilar disenchantments of his cooler judgment did likewise deprive of\ntheir full lusciousness several other equally marked demonstrations of\nhis literary celebrity. Applications for autographs showered in upon\nhim; but in sometimes humorously gratifying the more urgent requests of\nthese singular people Pierre could not but feel a pang of regret, that\nowing to the very youthful and quite unformed character of his\nhandwriting, his signature did not possess that inflexible uniformity,\nwhich--for mere prudential reasons, if nothing more--should always mark\nthe hand of illustrious men. His heart thrilled with sympathetic anguish\nfor posterity, which would be certain to stand hopelessly perplexed\nbefore so many contradictory signatures of one supereminent name. Alas!\nposterity would be sure to conclude that they were forgeries all; that\nno chirographic relic of the sublime poet Glendinning survived to their\nmiserable times.\n\nFrom the proprietors of the Magazines whose pages were honored by his\neffusions, he received very pressing epistolary solicitations for the\nloan of his portrait in oil, in order to take an engraving therefrom,\nfor a frontispiece to their periodicals. But here again the most\nmelancholy considerations obtruded. It had always been one of the lesser\nambitions of Pierre, to sport a flowing beard, which he deemed the most\nnoble corporeal badge of the man, not to speak of the illustrious\nauthor. But as yet he was beardless; and no cunning compound of Rowland\nand Son could force a beard which should arrive at maturity in any\nreasonable time for the frontispiece. Besides, his boyish features and\nwhole expression were daily changing. Would he lend his authority to\nthis unprincipled imposture upon Posterity? Honor forbade.\n\nThese epistolary petitions were generally couched in an elaborately\nrespectful style; thereby intimating with what deep reverence his\nportrait would be handled, while unavoidably subjected to the discipline\nindispensable to obtain from it the engraved copy they prayed for. But\none or two of the persons who made occasional oral requisitions upon him\nin this matter of his engraved portrait, seemed less regardful of the\ninherent respect due to every man's portrait, much more, to that of a\ngenius so celebrated as Pierre. They did not even seem to remember that\nthe portrait of any man generally receives, and indeed is entitled to\nmore reverence than the original man himself; since one may freely clap\na celebrated friend on the shoulder, yet would by no means tweak his\nnose in his portrait. The reason whereof may be this: that the portrait\nis better entitled to reverence than the man; inasmuch as nothing\nbelittling can be imagined concerning the portrait, whereas many\nunavoidably belittling things can be fancied as touching the man.\n\nUpon one occasion, happening suddenly to encounter a literary\nacquaintance--a joint editor of the \"Captain Kidd Monthly\"--who suddenly\npopped upon him round a corner, Pierre was startled by a\nrapid--\"Good-morning, good-morning;--just the man I wanted:--come, step\nround now with me, and have your Daguerreotype taken;--get it engraved\nthen in no time;--want it for the next issue.\"\n\nSo saying, this chief mate of Captain Kidd seized Pierre's arm, and in\nthe most vigorous manner was walking him off, like an officer a\npickpocket, when Pierre civilly said--\"Pray, sir, hold, if you please, I\nshall do no such thing.\"--\"Pooh, pooh--must have it--public\nproperty--come along--only a door or two now.\"--\"Public property!\"\nrejoined Pierre, \"that may do very well for the 'Captain Kidd\nMonthly;'--it's very Captain Kiddish to say so. But I beg to repeat that\nI do not intend to accede.\"--\"Don't? Really?\" cried the other, amazedly\nstaring Pierre full in the countenance;--\"why bless your soul, _my_\nportrait is published--long ago published!\"--\"Can't help that,\nsir\"--said Pierre. \"Oh! come along, come along,\" and the chief mate\nseized him again with the most uncompunctious familiarity by the arm.\nThough the sweetest-tempered youth in the world when but decently\ntreated, Pierre had an ugly devil in him sometimes, very apt to be\nevoked by the personal profaneness of gentlemen of the Captain Kidd\nschool of literature. \"Look you, my good fellow,\" said he, submitting to\nhis impartial inspection a determinately double fist,--\"drop my arm\nnow--or I'll drop you. To the devil with you and your Daguerreotype!\"\n\nThis incident, suggestive as it was at the time, in the sequel had a\nsurprising effect upon Pierre. For he considered with what infinite\nreadiness now, the most faithful portrait of any one could be taken by\nthe Daguerreotype, whereas in former times a faithful portrait was only\nwithin the power of the moneyed, or mental aristocrats of the earth. How\nnatural then the inference, that instead, as in old times, immortalizing\na genius, a portrait now only _dayalized_ a dunce. Besides, when every\nbody has his portrait published, true distinction lies in not having\nyours published at all. For if you are published along with Tom, Dick,\nand Harry, and wear a coat of their cut, how then are you distinct from\nTom, Dick, and Harry? Therefore, even so miserable a motive as downright\npersonal vanity helped to operate in this matter with Pierre.\n\nSome zealous lovers of the general literature of the age, as well as\ndeclared devotees to his own great genius, frequently petitioned him for\nthe materials wherewith to frame his biography. They assured him, that\nlife of all things was most insecure. He might feel many years in him\nyet; time might go lightly by him; but in any sudden and fatal sickness,\nhow would his last hours be embittered by the thought, that he was about\nto depart forever, leaving the world utterly unprovided with the\nknowledge of what were the precise texture and hue of the first trowsers\nhe wore. These representations did certainly touch him in a very tender\nspot, not previously unknown to the schoolmaster. But when Pierre\nconsidered, that owing to his extreme youth, his own recollections of\nthe past soon merged into all manner of half-memories and a general\nvagueness, he could not find it in his conscience to present such\nmaterials to the impatient biographers, especially as his chief\nverifying authority in these matters of his past career, was now\neternally departed beyond all human appeal. His excellent nurse Clarissa\nhad been dead four years and more. In vain a young literary friend, the\nwell-known author of two Indexes and one Epic, to whom the subject\nhappened to be mentioned, warmly espoused the cause of the distressed\nbiographers; saying that however unpleasant, one must needs pay the\npenalty of celebrity; it was no use to stand back; and concluded by\ntaking from the crown of his hat the proof-sheets of his own biography,\nwhich, with the most thoughtful consideration for the masses, was\nshortly to be published in the pamphlet form, price only a shilling.\n\nIt only the more bewildered and pained him, when still other and less\ndelicate applicants sent him their regularly printed\n_Biographico-Solicito Circulars_, with his name written in ink; begging\nhim to honor them and the world with a neat draft of his life, including\ncriticisms on his own writings; the printed circular indiscriminately\nprotesting, that undoubtedly he knew more of his own life than any other\nliving man; and that only he who had put together the great works of\nGlendinning could be fully qualified thoroughly to analyze them, and\ncast the ultimate judgment upon their remarkable construction.\n\nNow, it was under the influence of the humiliating emotions engendered\nby things like the above; it was when thus haunted by publishers,\nengravers, editors, critics, autograph-collectors, portrait-fanciers,\nbiographers, and petitioning and remonstrating literary friends of all\nsorts; it was then, that there stole into the youthful soul of Pierre,\nmelancholy forebodings of the utter unsatisfactoriness of all human\nfame; since the most ardent profferings of the most martyrizing\ndemonstrations in his behalf,--these he was sorrowfully obliged to turn\naway.\n\nAnd it may well be believed, that after the wonderful vital\nworld-revelation so suddenly made to Pierre at the Meadows--a revelation\nwhich, at moments, in some certain things, fairly Timonized him--he had\nnot failed to clutch with peculiar nervous detestation and contempt that\nample parcel, containing the letters of his Biographico and other silly\ncorrespondents, which, in a less ferocious hour, he had filed away as\ncuriosities. It was with an almost infernal grin, that he saw that\nparticular heap of rubbish eternally quenched in the fire, and felt\nthat as it was consumed before his eyes, so in his soul was forever\nkilled the last and minutest undeveloped microscopic germ of that most\ndespicable vanity to which those absurd correspondents thought to\nappeal.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK XVIII.\n\nPIERRE, AS A JUVENILE AUTHOR, RECONSIDERED.\n\n\nI.\n\nInasmuch as by various indirect intimations much more than ordinary\nnatural genius has been imputed to Pierre, it may have seemed an\ninconsistency, that only the merest magazine papers should have been\nthus far the sole productions of his mind. Nor need it be added, that,\nin the soberest earnest, those papers contained nothing uncommon;\nindeed--entirely now to drop all irony, if hitherto any thing like that\nhas been indulged in--those fugitive things of Master Pierre's were the\nveriest common-place.\n\nIt is true, as I long before said, that Nature at Saddle Meadows had\nvery early been as a benediction to Pierre;--had blown her wind-clarion\nto him from the blue hills, and murmured melodious secrecies to him by\nher streams and her woods. But while nature thus very early and very\nabundantly feeds us, she is very late in tutoring us as to the proper\nmethodization of our diet. Or,--to change the metaphor,--there are\nimmense quarries of fine marble; but how to get it out; how to chisel\nit; how to construct any temple? Youth must wholly quit, then, the\nquarry, for awhile; and not only go forth, and get tools to use in the\nquarry, but must go and thoroughly study architecture. Now the\nquarry-discoverer is long before the stone-cutter; and the stone-cutter\nis long before the architect; and the architect is long before the\ntemple; for the temple is the crown of the world.\n\nYes; Pierre was not only very unarchitectural at that time, but Pierre\nwas very young, indeed, at that time. And it is often to be observed,\nthat as in digging for precious metals in the mines, much earthy rubbish\nhas first to be troublesomely handled and thrown out; so, in digging in\none's soul for the fine gold of genius, much dullness and common-place\nis first brought to light. Happy would it be, if the man possessed in\nhimself some receptacle for his own rubbish of this sort: but he is like\nthe occupant of a dwelling, whose refuse can not be clapped into his own\ncellar, but must be deposited in the street before his own door, for the\npublic functionaries to take care of. No common-place is ever\neffectually got rid of, except by essentially emptying one's self of it\ninto a book; for once trapped in a book, then the book can be put into\nthe fire, and all will be well. But they are not always put into the\nfire; and this accounts for the vast majority of miserable books over\nthose of positive merit. Nor will any thoroughly sincere man, who is an\nauthor, ever be rash in precisely defining the period, when he has\ncompletely ridded himself of his rubbish, and come to the latent gold in\nhis mine. It holds true, in every case, that the wiser a man is, the\nmore misgivings he has on certain points.\n\nIt is well enough known, that the best productions of the best human\nintellects, are generally regarded by those intellects as mere immature\nfreshman exercises, wholly worthless in themselves, except as\ninitiatives for entering the great University of God after death.\nCertain it is, that if any inferences can be drawn from observations of\nthe familiar lives of men of the greatest mark, their finest things,\nthose which become the foolish glory of the world, are not only very\npoor and inconsiderable to themselves, but often positively distasteful;\nthey would rather not have the book in the room. In minds comparatively\ninferior as compared with the above, these surmising considerations so\nsadden and unfit, that they become careless of what they write; go to\ntheir desks with discontent, and only remain there--victims to headache,\nand pain in the back--by the hard constraint of some social necessity.\nEqually paltry and despicable to them, are the works thus composed; born\nof unwillingness and the bill of the baker; the rickety offspring of a\nparent, careless of life herself, and reckless of the germ-life she\ncontains. Let not the short-sighted world for a moment imagine, that any\nvanity lurks in such minds; only hired to appear on the stage, not\nvoluntarily claiming the public attention; their utmost life-redness and\nglow is but rouge, washed off in private with bitterest tears; their\nlaugh only rings because it is hollow; and the answering laugh is no\nlaughter to them.\n\nThere is nothing so slipperily alluring as sadness; we become sad in the\nfirst place by having nothing stirring to do; we continue in it, because\nwe have found a snug sofa at last. Even so, it may possibly be, that\narrived at this quiet retrospective little episode in the career of my\nhero--this shallowly expansive embayed Tappan Zee of my otherwise\ndeep-heady Hudson--I too begin to loungingly expand, and wax harmlessly\nsad and sentimental.\n\nNow, what has been hitherto presented in reference to Pierre, concerning\nrubbish, as in some cases the unavoidable first-fruits of genius, is in\nno wise contradicted by the fact, that the first published works of many\nmeritorious authors have given mature token of genius; for we do not\nknow how many they previously published to the flames; or privately\npublished in their own brains, and suppressed there as quickly. And in\nthe inferior instances of an immediate literary success, in very young\nwriters, it will be almost invariably observable, that for that instant\nsuccess they were chiefly indebted to some rich and peculiar experience\nin life, embodied in a book, which because, for that cause, containing\noriginal matter, the author himself, forsooth, is to be considered\noriginal; in this way, many very original books, being the product of\nvery unoriginal minds. Indeed, man has only to be but a little\ncircumspect, and away flies the last rag of his vanity. The world is\nforever babbling of originality; but there never yet was an original\nman, in the sense intended by the world; the first man himself--who\naccording to the Rabbins was also the first author--not being an\noriginal; the only original author being God. Had Milton's been the lot\nof Caspar Hauser, Milton would have been vacant as he. For though the\nnaked soul of man doth assuredly contain one latent element of\nintellectual productiveness; yet never was there a child born solely\nfrom one parent; the visible world of experience being that procreative\nthing which impregnates the muses; self-reciprocally efficient\nhermaphrodites being but a fable.\n\nThere is infinite nonsense in the world on all of these matters; hence\nblame me not if I contribute my mite. It is impossible to talk or to\nwrite without apparently throwing oneself helplessly open; the\nInvulnerable Knight wears his visor down. Still, it is pleasant to chat;\nfor it passes the time ere we go to our beds; and speech is farther\nincited, when like strolling improvisatores of Italy, we are paid for\nour breath. And we are only too thankful when the gapes of the audience\ndismiss us with the few ducats we earn.\n\n\nII.\n\nIt may have been already inferred, that the pecuniary plans of Pierre\ntouching his independent means of support in the city were based upon\nhis presumed literary capabilities. For what else could he do? He knew\nno profession, no trade. Glad now perhaps might he have been, if Fate\nhad made him a blacksmith, and not a gentleman, a Glendinning, and a\ngenius. But here he would have been unpardonably rash, had he not\nalready, in some degree, actually tested the fact, in his own personal\nexperience, that it is not altogether impossible for a magazine\ncontributor to Juvenile American literature to receive a few pence in\nexchange for his ditties. Such cases stand upon imperishable record, and\nit were both folly and ingratitude to disown them.\n\nBut since the fine social position and noble patrimony of Pierre, had\nthus far rendered it altogether unnecessary for him to earn the least\nfarthing of his own in the world, whether by hand or by brain; it may\nseem desirable to explain a little here as we go. We shall do so, but\nalways including, the preamble.\n\nSometimes every possible maxim or thought seems an old one; yet it is\namong the elder of the things in that unaugmentable stock, that never\nmind what one's situation may be, however prosperous and happy, he will\nstill be impatient of it; he will still reach out of himself, and beyond\nevery present condition. So, while many a poor be-inked galley-slave,\ntoiling with the heavy oar of a quill, to gain something wherewithal to\nstave off the cravings of nature; and in his hours of morbid\nself-reproach, regarding his paltry wages, at all events, as an\nunavoidable disgrace to him; while this galley-slave of letters would\nhave leaped with delight--reckless of the feeble seams of his\npantaloons--at the most distant prospect of inheriting the broad farms\nof Saddle Meadows, lord of an all-sufficing income, and forever exempt\nfrom wearing on his hands those treacherous plague-spots of\nindigence--videlicet, blots from the inkstand;--Pierre himself, the\nundoubted and actual possessor of the things only longingly and\nhopelessly imagined by the other; the then top of Pierre's worldly\nambition, was the being able to boast that he had written such matters\nas publishers would pay something for in the way of a mere business\ntransaction, which they thought would prove profitable. Yet altogether\nweak and silly as this may seem in Pierre, let us preambillically\nexamine a little further, and see if it be so indeed.\n\nPierre was proud; and a proud man--proud with the sort of pride now\nmeant--ever holds but lightly those things, however beneficent, which he\ndid not for himself procure. Were such pride carried out to its\nlegitimate end, the man would eat no bread, the seeds whereof he had not\nhimself put into the soil, not entirely without humiliation, that even\nthat seed must be borrowed from some previous planter. A proud man likes\nto feel himself in himself, and not by reflection in others. He likes to\nbe not only his own Alpha and Omega, but to be distinctly all the\nintermediate gradations, and then to slope off on his own spine either\nway, into the endless impalpable ether. What a glory it was then to\nPierre, when first in his two gentlemanly hands he jingled the wages of\nlabor! Talk of drums and the fife; the echo of coin of one's own earning\nis more inspiring than all the trumpets of Sparta. How disdainfully now\nhe eyed the sumptuousness of his hereditary halls--the hangings, and the\npictures, and the bragging historic armorials and the banners of the\nGlendinning renown; confident, that if need should come, he would not be\nforced to turn resurrectionist, and dig up his grandfather's\nIndian-chief grave for the ancestral sword and shield, ignominiously to\npawn them for a living! He could live on himself. Oh, twice-blessed now,\nin the feeling of practical capacity, was Pierre.\n\nThe mechanic, the day-laborer, has but one way to live; his body must\nprovide for his body. But not only could Pierre in some sort, do that;\nhe could do the other; and letting his body stay lazily at home, send\noff his soul to labor, and his soul would come faithfully back and pay\nhis body her wages. So, some unprofessional gentlemen of the\naristocratic South, who happen to own slaves, give those slaves liberty\nto go and seek work, and every night return with their wages, which\nconstitute those idle gentlemen's income. Both ambidexter and\nquadruple-armed is that man, who in a day-laborer's body, possesses a\nday-laboring soul. Yet let not such an one be over-confident. Our God is\na jealous God; He wills not that any man should permanently possess the\nleast shadow of His own self-sufficient attributes. Yoke the body to the\nsoul, and put both to the plough, and the one or the other must in the\nend assuredly drop in the furrow. Keep, then, thy body effeminate for\nlabor, and thy soul laboriously robust; or else thy soul effeminate for\nlabor, and thy body laboriously robust. Elect! the two will not\nlastingly abide in one yoke. Thus over the most vigorous and soaring\nconceits, doth the cloud of Truth come stealing; thus doth the shot,\neven of a sixty-two-pounder pointed upward, light at last on the earth;\nfor strive we how we may, we can not overshoot the earth's orbit, to\nreceive the attractions of other planets; Earth's law of gravitation\nextends far beyond her own atmosphere.\n\nIn the operative opinion of this world, he who is already fully provided\nwith what is necessary for him, that man shall have more; while he who\nis deplorably destitute of the same, he shall have taken away from him\neven that which he hath. Yet the world vows it is a very plain,\ndownright matter-of-fact, plodding, humane sort of world. It is governed\nonly by the simplest principles, and scorns all ambiguities, all\ntranscendentals, and all manner of juggling. Now some imaginatively\nheterodoxical men are often surprisingly twitted upon their willful\ninverting of all common-sense notions, their absurd and all-displacing\ntranscendentals, which say three is four, and two and two make ten. But\nif the eminent Jugglarius himself ever advocated in mere words a\ndoctrine one thousandth part so ridiculous and subversive of all\npractical sense, as that doctrine which the world actually and eternally\npractices, of giving unto him who already hath more than enough, still\nmore of the superfluous article, and taking away from him who hath\nnothing at all, even that which he hath,--then is the truest book in the\nworld a lie.\n\nWherefore we see that the so-called Transcendentalists are not the only\npeople who deal in Transcendentals. On the contrary, we seem to see that\nthe Utilitarians,--the every-day world's people themselves, far\ntranscend those inferior Transcendentalists by their own\nincomprehensible worldly maxims. And--what is vastly more--with the one\nparty, their Transcendentals are but theoretic and inactive, and\ntherefore harmless; whereas with the other, they are actually clothed in\nliving deeds.\n\nThe highly graveling doctrine and practice of the world, above cited,\nhad in some small degree been manifested in the case of Pierre. He\nprospectively possessed the fee of several hundred farms scattered over\npart of two adjoining counties; and now the proprietor of that popular\nperiodical, the Gazelle Magazine, sent him several additional dollars\nfor his sonnets. That proprietor (though in sooth, he never read the\nsonnets, but referred them to his professional adviser; and was so\nignorant, that, for a long time previous to the periodical's actually\nbeing started, he insisted upon spelling the Gazelle with a _g_ for the\n_z_, as thus: _Gagelle_; maintaining, that in the Gazelle connection,\nthe _z_ was a mere impostor, and that the _g_ was soft; for he was a\njudge of softness, and could speak from experience); that proprietor was\nundoubtedly a Transcendentalist; for did he not act upon the\nTranscendental doctrine previously set forth?\n\nNow, the dollars derived from his ditties, these Pierre had always\ninvested in cigars; so that the puffs which indirectly brought him his\ndollars were again returned, but as perfumed puffs; perfumed with the\nsweet leaf of Havanna. So that this highly-celebrated and world-renowned\nPierre--the great author--whose likeness the world had never seen (for\nhad he not repeatedly refused the world his likeness?), this famous\npoet, and philosopher, author of \"_The Tropical Summer: a Sonnet_;\"\nagainst whose very life several desperadoes were darkly plotting (for\nhad not the biographers sworn they would have it!); this towering\ncelebrity--there he would sit smoking, and smoking, mild and\nself-festooned as a vapory mountain. It was very involuntarily and\nsatisfactorily reciprocal. His cigars were lighted in two ways: lighted\nby the sale of his sonnets, and lighted by the printed sonnets\nthemselves.\n\nFor even at that early time in his authorial life, Pierre, however vain\nof his fame, was not at all proud of his paper. Not only did he make\nallumettes of his sonnets when published, but was very careless about\nhis discarded manuscripts; they were to be found lying all round the\nhouse; gave a great deal of trouble to the housemaids in sweeping; went\nfor kindlings to the fires; and were forever flitting out of the\nwindows, and under the door-sills, into the faces of people passing the\nmanorial mansion. In this reckless, indifferent way of his, Pierre\nhimself was a sort of publisher. It is true his more familiar admirers\noften earnestly remonstrated with him, against this irreverence to the\nprimitive vestments of his immortal productions; saying, that whatever\nhad once felt the nib of his mighty pen, was thenceforth sacred as the\nlips which had but once saluted the great toe of the Pope. But hardened\nas he was to these friendly censurings, Pierre never forbade that ardent\nappreciation of \"The Tear,\" who, finding a small fragment of the\noriginal manuscript containing a dot (_tear_), over an _i_ (_eye_),\nesteemed the significant event providential; and begged the\ndistinguished favor of being permitted to have it for a brooch; and\nousted a cameo-head of Homer, to replace it with the more invaluable\ngem. He became inconsolable, when being caught in a rain, the dot\n(_tear_) disappeared from over the _i_ (_eye_); so that the strangeness\nand wonderfulness of the sonnet was still conspicuous; in that though\nthe least fragment of it could weep in a drought, yet did it become all\ntearless in a shower.\n\nBut this indifferent and supercilious amateur--deaf to the admiration of\nthe world; the enigmatically merry and renowned author of \"The Tear;\"\nthe pride of the Gazelle Magazine, on whose flaunting cover his name\nfigured at the head of all contributors--(no small men either; for their\nlives had all been fraternally written by each other, and they had\nclubbed, and had their likenesses all taken by the aggregate job, and\npublished on paper, all bought at one shop) this high-prestiged\nPierre--whose future popularity and voluminousness had become so\nstartlingly announced by what he had already written, that certain\nspeculators came to the Meadows to survey its water-power, if any, with\na view to start a paper-mill expressly for the great author, and so\nmonopolize his stationery dealings;--this vast being,--spoken of with\nawe by all merely youthful aspirants for fame; this age-neutralizing\nPierre;--before whom an old gentleman of sixty-five, formerly librarian\nto Congress, on being introduced to him at the Magazine publishers',\ndevoutly took off his hat, and kept it so, and remained standing, though\nPierre was socially seated with his hat on;--this wonderful, disdainful\ngenius--but only life-amateur as yet--is now soon to appear in a far\ndifferent guise. He shall now learn, and very bitterly learn, that\nthough the world worship Mediocrity and Common Place, yet hath it fire\nand sword for all cotemporary Grandeur; that though it swears that it\nfiercely assails all Hypocrisy, yet hath it not always an ear for\nEarnestness.\n\nAnd though this state of things, united with the ever multiplying\nfreshets of new books, seems inevitably to point to a coming time, when\nthe mass of humanity reduced to one level of dotage, authors shall be\nscarce as alchymists are to-day, and the printing-press be reckoned a\nsmall invention:--yet even now, in the foretaste of this let us hug\nourselves, oh, my Aurelian! that though the age of authors be passing,\nthe hours of earnestness shall remain!\n\n\n\n\nBOOK XIX.\n\nTHE CHURCH OF THE APOSTLES.\n\n\nI.\n\nIn the lower old-fashioned part of the city, in a narrow street--almost\na lane--once filled with demure-looking dwellings, but now chiefly with\nimmense lofty warehouses of foreign importers; and not far from the\ncorner where the lane intersected with a very considerable but\ncontracted thoroughfare for merchants and their clerks, and their carmen\nand porters; stood at this period a rather singular and ancient edifice,\na relic of the more primitive time. The material was a grayish stone,\nrudely cut and masoned into walls of surprising thickness and strength;\nalong two of which walls--the side ones--were distributed as many rows\nof arched and stately windows. A capacious, square, and wholly\nunornamented tower rose in front to twice the height of the body of the\nchurch; three sides of this tower were pierced with small and narrow\napertures. Thus far, in its external aspect, the building--now more than\na century old,--sufficiently attested for what purpose it had originally\nbeen founded. In its rear, was a large and lofty plain brick structure,\nwith its front to the rearward street, but its back presented to the\nback of the church, leaving a small, flagged, and quadrangular vacancy\nbetween. At the sides of this quadrangle, three stories of homely brick\ncolonnades afforded covered communication between the ancient church,\nand its less elderly adjunct. A dismantled, rusted, and forlorn old\nrailing of iron fencing in a small courtyard in front of the rearward\nbuilding, seemed to hint, that the latter had usurped an unoccupied\nspace formerly sacred as the old church's burial inclosure. Such a fancy\nwould have been entirely true. Built when that part of the city was\ndevoted to private residences, and not to warehouses and offices as now,\nthe old Church of the Apostles had had its days of sanctification and\ngrace; but the tide of change and progress had rolled clean through its\nbroad-aisle and side-aisles, and swept by far the greater part of its\ncongregation two or three miles up town. Some stubborn and elderly old\nmerchants and accountants, lingered awhile among its dusty pews,\nlistening to the exhortations of a faithful old pastor, who, sticking to\nhis post in this flight of his congregation, still propped his\nhalf-palsied form in the worm-eaten pulpit, and occasionally\npounded--though now with less vigorous hand--the moth-eaten covering of\nits desk. But it came to pass, that this good old clergyman died; and\nwhen the gray-headed and bald-headed remaining merchants and accountants\nfollowed his coffin out of the broad-aisle to see it reverently\ninterred; then that was the last time that ever the old edifice\nwitnessed the departure of a regular worshiping assembly from its walls.\nThe venerable merchants and accountants held a meeting, at which it was\nfinally decided, that, hard and unwelcome as the necessity might be, yet\nit was now no use to disguise the fact, that the building could no\nlonger be efficiently devoted to its primitive purpose. It must be\ndivided into stores; cut into offices; and given for a roost to the\ngregarious lawyers. This intention was executed, even to the making\noffices high up in the tower; and so well did the thing succeed, that\nultimately the church-yard was invaded for a supplemental edifice,\nlikewise to be promiscuously rented to the legal crowd. But this new\nbuilding very much exceeded the body of the church in height. It was\nsome seven stories; a fearful pile of Titanic bricks, lifting its tiled\nroof almost to a level with the top of the sacred tower.\n\nIn this ambitious erection the proprietors went a few steps, or rather a\nfew stories, too far. For as people would seldom willingly fall into\nlegal altercations unless the lawyers were always very handy to help\nthem; so it is ever an object with lawyers to have their offices as\nconvenient as feasible to the street; on the ground-floor, if possible,\nwithout a single acclivity of a step; but at any rate not in the seventh\nstory of any house, where their clients might be deterred from employing\nthem at all, if they were compelled to mount seven long flights of\nstairs, one over the other, with very brief landings, in order even to\npay their preliminary retaining fees. So, from some time after its\nthrowing open, the upper stories of the less ancient attached edifice\nremained almost wholly without occupants; and by the forlorn echoes of\ntheir vacuities, right over the head of the business-thriving legal\ngentlemen below, must--to some few of them at least--have suggested\nunwelcome similitudes, having reference to the crowded state of their\nbasement-pockets, as compared with the melancholy condition of their\nattics;--alas! full purses and empty heads! This dreary posture of\naffairs, however, was at last much altered for the better, by the\ngradual filling up of the vacant chambers on high, by scores of those\nmiscellaneous, bread-and-cheese adventurers, and ambiguously\nprofessional nondescripts in very genteel but shabby black, and\nunaccountable foreign-looking fellows in blue spectacles; who,\npreviously issuing from unknown parts of the world, like storks in\nHolland, light on the eaves, and in the attics of lofty old buildings in\nmost large sea-port towns. Here they sit and talk like magpies; or\ndescending in quest of improbable dinners, are to be seen drawn up along\nthe curb in front of the eating-houses, like lean rows of broken-hearted\npelicans on a beach; their pockets loose, hanging down and flabby, like\nthe pelican's pouches when fish are hard to be caught. But these poor,\npenniless devils still strive to make ample amends for their physical\nforlornness, by resolutely reveling in the region of blissful ideals.\n\nThey are mostly artists of various sorts; painters, or sculptors, or\nindigent students, or teachers of languages, or poets, or fugitive\nFrench politicians, or German philosophers. Their mental tendencies,\nhowever heterodox at times, are still very fine and spiritual upon the\nwhole; since the vacuity of their exchequers leads them to reject the\ncoarse materialism of Hobbs, and incline to the airy exaltations of the\nBerkelyan philosophy. Often groping in vain in their pockets, they can\nnot but give in to the Descartian vortices; while the abundance of\nleisure in their attics (physical and figurative), unite with the\nleisure in their stomachs, to fit them in an eminent degree for that\nundivided attention indispensable to the proper digesting of the\nsublimated Categories of Kant; especially as Kant (can't) is the one\ngreat palpable fact in their pervadingly impalpable lives. These are the\nglorious paupers, from whom I learn the profoundest mysteries of things;\nsince their very existence in the midst of such a terrible\nprecariousness of the commonest means of support, affords a problem on\nwhich many speculative nutcrackers have been vainly employed. Yet let me\nhere offer up three locks of my hair, to the memory of all such glorious\npaupers who have lived and died in this world. Surely, and truly I honor\nthem--noble men often at bottom--and for that very reason I make bold to\nbe gamesome about them; for where fundamental nobleness is, and\nfundamental honor is due, merriment is never accounted irreverent. The\nfools and pretenders of humanity, and the impostors and baboons among\nthe gods, these only are offended with raillery; since both those gods\nand men whose titles to eminence are secure, seldom worry themselves\nabout the seditious gossip of old apple-women, and the skylarkings of\nfunny little boys in the street.\n\nWhen the substance is gone, men cling to the shadow. Places once set\napart to lofty purposes, still retain the name of that loftiness, even\nwhen converted to the meanest uses. It would seem, as if forced by\nimperative Fate to renounce the reality of the romantic and lofty, the\npeople of the present would fain make a compromise by retaining some\npurely imaginative remainder. The curious effects of this tendency is\noftenest evinced in those venerable countries of the old transatlantic\nworld; where still over the Thames one bridge yet retains the monastic\ntide of Blackfriars; though not a single Black Friar, but many a\npickpocket, has stood on that bank since a good ways beyond the days of\nQueen Bess; where still innumerable other historic anomalies sweetly and\nsadly remind the present man of the wonderful procession that preceded\nhim in his new generation. Nor--though the comparative recentness of our\nown foundation upon these Columbian shores, excludes any considerable\nparticipation in these attractive anomalies,--yet are we not altogether,\nin our more elderly towns, wholly without some touch of them, here and\nthere. It was thus with the ancient Church of the Apostles--better\nknown, even in its primitive day, under the abbreviative of The\nApostles--which, though now converted from its original purpose to one\nso widely contrasting, yet still retained its majestical name. The\nlawyer or artist tenanting its chambers, whether in the new building or\nthe old, when asked where he was to be found, invariably replied,--_At\nthe Apostles'_. But because now, at last, in the course of the\ninevitable transplantations of the more notable localities of the\nvarious professions in a thriving and amplifying town, the venerable\nspot offered not such inducements as before to the legal gentlemen; and\nas the strange nondescript adventurers and artists, and indigent\nphilosophers of all sorts, crowded in as fast as the others left;\ntherefore, in reference to the metaphysical strangeness of these curious\ninhabitants, and owing in some sort to the circumstance, that several of\nthem were well-known Teleological Theorists, and Social Reformers, and\npolitical propagandists of all manner of heterodoxical tenets;\ntherefore, I say, and partly, peradventure, from some slight waggishness\nin the public; the immemorial popular name of the ancient church itself\nwas participatingly transferred to the dwellers therein. So it came to\npass, that in the general fashion of the day, he who had chambers in the\nold church was familiarly styled an _Apostle_.\n\nBut as every effect is but the cause of another and a subsequent one, so\nit now happened that finding themselves thus clannishly, and not\naltogether infelicitously entitled, the occupants of the venerable\nchurch began to come together out of their various dens, in more social\ncommunion; attracted toward each other by a title common to all.\nBy-and-by, from this, they went further; and insensibly, at last became\norganized in a peculiar society, which, though exceedingly\ninconspicuous, and hardly perceptible in its public demonstrations, was\nstill secretly suspected to have some mysterious ulterior object,\nvaguely connected with the absolute overturning of Church and State, and\nthe hasty and premature advance of some unknown great political and\nreligious Millennium. Still, though some zealous conservatives and\ndevotees of morals, several times left warning at the police-office, to\nkeep a wary eye on the old church; and though, indeed, sometimes an\nofficer would look up inquiringly at the suspicious narrow window-slits\nin the lofty tower; yet, to say the truth, was the place, to all\nappearance, a very quiet and decorous one, and its occupants a company\nof harmless people, whose greatest reproach was efflorescent coats and\ncrack-crowned hats all podding in the sun.\n\nThough in the middle of the day many bales and boxes would be trundled\nalong the stores in front of the Apostles'; and along its critically\nnarrow sidewalk, the merchants would now and then hurry to meet their\nchecks ere the banks should close: yet the street, being mostly devoted\nto mere warehousing purposes, and not used as a general thoroughfare, it\nwas at all times a rather secluded and silent place. But from an hour or\ntwo before sundown to ten or eleven o'clock the next morning, it was\nremarkably silent and depopulated, except by the Apostles themselves;\nwhile every Sunday it presented an aspect of surprising and startling\nquiescence; showing nothing but one long vista of six or seven stories\nof inexorable iron shutters on both sides of the way. It was pretty much\nthe same with the other street, which, as before said, intersected with\nthe warehousing lane, not very far from the Apostles'. For though that\nstreet was indeed a different one from the latter, being full of cheap\nrefectories for clerks, foreign restaurants, and other places of\ncommercial resort; yet the only hum in it was restricted to business\nhours; by night it was deserted of every occupant but the lamp-posts;\nand on Sunday, to walk through it, was like walking through an avenue of\nsphinxes.\n\nSuch, then, was the present condition of the ancient Church of the\nApostles; buzzing with a few lingering, equivocal lawyers in the\nbasement, and populous with all sorts of poets, painters, paupers and\nphilosophers above. A mysterious professor of the flute was perched in\none of the upper stories of the tower; and often, of silent, moonlight\nnights, his lofty, melodious notes would be warbled forth over the roofs\nof the ten thousand warehouses around him--as of yore, the bell had\npealed over the domestic gables of a long-departed generation.\n\n\nII.\n\nOn the third night following the arrival of the party in the city,\nPierre sat at twilight by a lofty window in the rear building of the\nApostles'. The chamber was meager even to meanness. No carpet on the\nfloor, no picture on the wall; nothing but a low, long, and very\ncurious-looking single bedstead, that might possibly serve for an\nindigent bachelor's pallet, a large, blue, chintz-covered chest, a\nrickety, rheumatic, and most ancient mahogany chair, and a wide board of\nthe toughest live-oak, about six feet long, laid upon two upright empty\nflour-barrels, and loaded with a large bottle of ink, an unfastened\nbundle of quills, a pen-knife, a folder, and a still unbound ream of\nfoolscap paper, significantly stamped, \"Ruled; Blue.\"\n\nThere, on the third night, at twilight, sat Pierre by that lofty window\nof a beggarly room in the rear-building of the Apostles'. He was\nentirely idle, apparently; there was nothing in his hands; but there\nmight have been something on his heart. Now and then he fixedly gazes at\nthe curious-looking, rusty old bedstead. It seemed powerfully symbolical\nto him; and most symbolical it was. For it was the ancient dismemberable\nand portable camp-bedstead of his grandfather, the defiant defender of\nthe Fort, the valiant captain in many an unsuccumbing campaign. On that\nvery camp-bedstead, there, beneath his tent on the field, the glorious\nold mild-eyed and warrior-hearted general had slept, and but waked to\nbuckle his knight-making sword by his side; for it was noble knighthood\nto be slain by grand Pierre; in the other world his foes' ghosts bragged\nof the hand that had given them their passports.\n\nBut has that hard bed of War, descended for an inheritance to the soft\nbody of Peace? In the peaceful time of full barns, and when the noise of\nthe peaceful flail is abroad, and the hum of peaceful commerce resounds,\nis the grandson of two Generals a warrior too? Oh, not for naught, in\nthe time of this seeming peace, are warrior grandsires given to Pierre!\nFor Pierre is a warrior too; Life his campaign, and three fierce allies,\nWoe and Scorn and Want, his foes. The wide world is banded against him;\nfor lo you! he holds up the standard of Right, and swears by the Eternal\nand True! But ah, Pierre, Pierre, when thou goest to that bed, how\nhumbling the thought, that thy most extended length measures not the\nproud six feet four of thy grand John of Gaunt sire! The stature of the\nwarrior is cut down to the dwindled glory of the fight. For more\nglorious in real tented field to strike down your valiant foe, than in\nthe conflicts of a noble soul with a dastardly world to chase a vile\nenemy who ne'er will show front.\n\nThere, then, on the third night, at twilight, by the lofty window of\nthat beggarly room, sat Pierre in the rear building of the Apostles'. He\nis gazing out from the window now. But except the donjon form of the old\ngray tower, seemingly there is nothing to see but a wilderness of tiles,\nslate, shingles, and tin;--the desolate hanging wildernesses of tiles,\nslate, shingles and tin, wherewith we modern Babylonians replace the\nfair hanging-gardens of the fine old Asiatic times when the excellent\nNebuchadnezzar was king.\n\nThere he sits, a strange exotic, transplanted from the delectable\nalcoves of the old manorial mansion, to take root in this niggard soil.\nNo more do the sweet purple airs of the hills round about the green\nfields of Saddle Meadows come revivingly wafted to his cheek. Like a\nflower he feels the change; his bloom is gone from his cheek; his cheek\nis wilted and pale.\n\nFrom the lofty window of that beggarly room, what is it that Pierre is\nso intently eying? There is no street at his feet; like a profound black\ngulf the open area of the quadrangle gapes beneath him. But across it,\nand at the further end of the steep roof of the ancient church, there\nlooms the gray and grand old tower; emblem to Pierre of an unshakable\nfortitude, which, deep-rooted in the heart of the earth, defied all the\nhowls of the air.\n\nThere is a door in Pierre's room opposite the window of Pierre: and now\na soft knock is heard in that direction, accompanied by gentle words,\nasking whether the speaker might enter.\n\n\"Yes, always, sweet Isabel\"--answered Pierre, rising and approaching\nthe door;--\"here: let us drag out the old camp-bed for a sofa; come, sit\ndown now, my sister, and let us fancy ourselves anywhere thou wilt.\"\n\n\"Then, my brother, let us fancy ourselves in realms of everlasting\ntwilight and peace, where no bright sun shall rise, because the black\nnight is always its follower. Twilight and peace, my brother, twilight\nand peace!\"\n\n\"It is twilight now, my sister; and surely, this part of the city at\nleast seems still.\"\n\n\"Twilight now, but night soon; then a brief sun, and then another long\nnight. Peace now, but sleep and nothingness soon, and then hard work for\nthee, my brother, till the sweet twilight come again.\"\n\n\"Let us light a candle, my sister; the evening is deepening.\"\n\n\"For what light a candle, dear Pierre?--Sit close to me, my brother.\"\n\nHe moved nearer to her, and stole one arm around her; her sweet head\nleaned against his breast; each felt the other's throbbing.\n\n\"Oh, my dear Pierre, why should we always be longing for peace, and then\nbe impatient of peace when it comes? Tell me, my brother! Not two hours\nago, thou wert wishing for twilight, and now thou wantest a candle to\nhurry the twilight's last lingering away.\"\n\nBut Pierre did not seem to hear her; his arm embraced her tighter; his\nwhole frame was invisibly trembling. Then suddenly in a low tone of\nwonderful intensity he breathed:\n\n\"Isabel! Isabel!\"\n\nShe caught one arm around him, as his was around herself; the tremor ran\nfrom him to her; both sat dumb.\n\nHe rose, and paced the room.\n\n\"Well, Pierre; thou camest in here to arrange thy matters, thou saidst.\nNow what hast thou done? Come, we will light a candle now.\"\n\nThe candle was lighted, and their talk went on.\n\n\"How about the papers, my brother? Dost thou find every thing right?\nHast thou decided upon what to publish first, while thou art writing the\nnew thing thou didst hint of?\"\n\n\"Look at that chest, my sister. Seest thou not that the cords are yet\nuntied?\"\n\n\"Then thou hast not been into it at all as yet?\"\n\n\"Not at all, Isabel. In ten days I have lived ten thousand years.\nForewarned now of the rubbish in that chest, I can not summon the heart\nto open it. Trash! Dross! Dirt!\"\n\n\"Pierre! Pierre! what change is this? Didst thou not tell me, ere we\ncame hither, that thy chest not only contained some silver and gold, but\nlikewise far more precious things, readily convertible into silver and\ngold? Ah, Pierre, thou didst swear we had naught to fear!\"\n\n\"If I have ever willfully deceived thee, Isabel, may the high gods prove\nBenedict Arnolds to me, and go over to the devils to reinforce them\nagainst me! But to have ignorantly deceived myself and thee together,\nIsabel; that is a very different thing. Oh, what a vile juggler and\ncheat is man! Isabel, in that chest are things which in the hour of\ncomposition, I thought the very heavens looked in from the windows in\nastonishment at their beauty and power. Then, afterward, when days\ncooled me down, and again I took them up and scanned them, some\nunderlying suspicions intruded; but when in the open air, I recalled the\nfresh, unwritten images of the bunglingly written things; then I felt\nbuoyant and triumphant again; as if by that act of ideal recalling, I\nhad, forsooth, transferred the perfect ideal to the miserable written\nattempt at embodying it. This mood remained. So that afterward how I\ntalked to thee about the wonderful things I had done; the gold and the\nsilver mine I had long before sprung for thee and for me, who never were\nto come to want in body or mind. Yet all this time, there was the latent\nsuspicion of folly; but I would not admit it; I shut my soul's door in\nits face. Yet now, the ten thousand universal revealings brand me on the\nforehead with fool! and like protested notes at the Bankers, all those\nwritten things of mine, are jaggingly cut through and through with the\nprotesting hammer of Truth!--Oh, I am sick, sick, sick!\"\n\n\"Let the arms that never were filled but by thee, lure thee back again,\nPierre, to the peace of the twilight, even though it be of the dimmest!\"\n\nShe blew out the light, and made Pierre sit down by her; and their hands\nwere placed in each other's.\n\n\"Say, are not thy torments now gone, my brother?\"\n\n\"But replaced by--by--by--Oh God, Isabel, unhand me!\" cried Pierre,\nstarting up. \"Ye heavens, that have hidden yourselves in the black hood\nof the night, I call to ye! If to follow Virtue to her uttermost vista,\nwhere common souls never go; if by that I take hold on hell, and the\nuttermost virtue, after all, prove but a betraying pander to the\nmonstrousest vice,--then close in and crush me, ye stony walls, and into\none gulf let all things tumble together!\"\n\n\"My brother! this is some incomprehensible raving,\" pealed Isabel,\nthrowing both arms around him;--\"my brother, my brother!\"\n\n\"Hark thee to thy furthest inland soul\"--thrilled Pierre in a steeled\nand quivering voice. \"Call me brother no more! How knowest thou I am thy\nbrother? Did thy mother tell thee? Did my father say so to me?--I am\nPierre, and thou Isabel, wide brother and sister in the common\nhumanity,--no more. For the rest, let the gods look after their own\ncombustibles. If they have put powder-casks in me--let them look to it!\nlet them look to it! Ah! now I catch glimpses, and seem to half-see,\nsomehow, that the uttermost ideal of moral perfection in man is wide of\nthe mark. The demigods trample on trash, and Virtue and Vice are trash!\nIsabel, I will write such things--I will gospelize the world anew, and\nshow them deeper secrets than the Apocalypse!--I will write it, I will\nwrite it!\"\n\n\"Pierre, I am a poor girl, born in the midst of a mystery, bred in\nmystery, and still surviving to mystery. So mysterious myself, the air\nand the earth are unutterable to me; no word have I to express them. But\nthese are the circumambient mysteries; thy words, thy thoughts, open\nother wonder-worlds to me, whither by myself I might fear to go. But\ntrust to me, Pierre. With thee, with thee, I would boldly swim a\nstarless sea, and be buoy to thee, there, when thou the strong swimmer\nshouldst faint. Thou, Pierre, speakest of Virtue and Vice; life-secluded\nIsabel knows neither the one nor the other, but by hearsay. What are\nthey, in their real selves, Pierre? Tell me first what is\nVirtue:--begin!\"\n\n\"If on that point the gods are dumb, shall a pigmy speak? Ask the air!\"\n\n\"Then Virtue is nothing.\"\n\n\"Not that!\"\n\n\"Then Vice?\"\n\n\"Look: a nothing is the substance, it casts one shadow one way, and\nanother the other way; and these two shadows cast from one nothing;\nthese, seems to me, are Virtue and Vice.\"\n\n\"Then why torment thyself so, dearest Pierre?\"\n\n\"It is the law.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"That a nothing should torment a nothing; for I am a nothing. It is all\na dream--we dream that we dreamed we dream.\"\n\n\"Pierre, when thou just hovered on the verge, thou wert a riddle to me;\nbut now, that thou art deep down in the gulf of the soul,--now, when\nthou wouldst be lunatic to wise men, perhaps--now doth poor ignorant\nIsabel begin to comprehend thee. Thy feeling hath long been mine,\nPierre. Long loneliness and anguish have opened miracles to me. Yes, it\nis all a dream!\"\n\nSwiftly he caught her in his arms:--\"From nothing proceeds nothing,\nIsabel! How can one sin in a dream?\"\n\n\"First what is sin, Pierre?\"\n\n\"Another name for the other name, Isabel.\"\n\n\"For Virtue, Pierre?\"\n\n\"No, for Vice.\"\n\n\"Let us sit down again, my brother.\"\n\n\"I am Pierre.\"\n\n\"Let us sit down again, Pierre; sit close; thy arm!\"\n\nAnd so, on the third night, when the twilight was gone, and no lamp was\nlit, within the lofty window of that beggarly room, sat Pierre and\nIsabel hushed.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK XX.\n\nCHARLIE MILLTHORPE.\n\n\nI.\n\nPierre had been induced to take chambers at the Apostles', by one of the\nApostles themselves, an old acquaintance of his, and a native of Saddle\nMeadows.\n\nMillthorpe was the son of a very respectable farmer--now dead--of more\nthan common intelligence, and whose bowed shoulders and homely garb had\nstill been surmounted by a head fit for a Greek philosopher, and\nfeatures so fine and regular that they would have well graced an opulent\ngentleman. The political and social levelings and confoundings of all\nmanner of human elements in America, produce many striking individual\nanomalies unknown in other lands. Pierre well remembered old farmer\nMillthorpe:--the handsome, melancholy, calm-tempered, mute, old man; in\nwhose countenance--refinedly ennobled by nature, and yet coarsely tanned\nand attenuated by many a prolonged day's work in the harvest--rusticity\nand classicalness were strangely united. The delicate profile of his\nface, bespoke the loftiest aristocracy; his knobbed and bony hands\nresembled a beggar's.\n\nThough for several generations the Millthorpes had lived on the\nGlendinning lands, they loosely and unostentatiously traced their origin\nto an emigrating English Knight, who had crossed the sea in the time of\nthe elder Charles. But that indigence which had prompted the knight to\nforsake his courtly country for the howling wilderness, was the only\nremaining hereditament left to his bedwindled descendants in the fourth\nand fifth remove. At the time that Pierre first recollected this\ninteresting man, he had, a year or two previous, abandoned an ample farm\non account of absolute inability to meet the manorial rent, and was\nbecome the occupant of a very poor and contracted little place, on which\nwas a small and half-ruinous house. There, he then harbored with his\nwife,--a very gentle and retiring person,--his three little daughters,\nand his only son, a lad of Pierre's own age. The hereditary beauty and\nyouthful bloom of this boy; his sweetness of temper, and something of\nnatural refinement as contrasted with the unrelieved rudeness, and\noftentimes sordidness, of his neighbors; these things had early\nattracted the sympathetic, spontaneous friendliness of Pierre. They were\noften wont to take their boyish rambles together; and even the severely\ncritical Mrs. Glendinning, always fastidiously cautious as to the\ncompanions of Pierre, had never objected to his intimacy with so\nprepossessing and handsome a rustic as Charles.\n\nBoys are often very swiftly acute in forming a judgment on character.\nThe lads had not long companioned, ere Pierre concluded, that however\nfine his face, and sweet his temper, young Millthorpe was but little\nvigorous in mind; besides possessing a certain constitutional,\nsophomorean presumption and egotism; which, however, having nothing to\nfeed on but his father's meal and potatoes, and his own essentially\ntimid and humane disposition, merely presented an amusing and harmless,\nthough incurable, anomalous feature in his character, not at all\nimpairing the good-will and companionableness of Pierre; for even in his\nboyhood, Pierre possessed a sterling charity, which could cheerfully\noverlook all minor blemishes in his inferiors, whether in fortune or\nmind; content and glad to embrace the good whenever presented, or with\nwhatever conjoined. So, in youth, do we unconsciously act upon those\npeculiar principles, which in conscious and verbalized maxims shall\nsystematically regulate our maturer lives;--a fact, which forcibly\nillustrates the necessitarian dependence of our lives, and their\nsubordination, not to ourselves, but to Fate.\n\nIf the grown man of taste, possess not only some eye to detect the\npicturesque in the natural landscape, so also, has he as keen a\nperception of what may not unfitly be here styled, the _povertiresque_\nin the social landscape. To such an one, not more picturesquely\nconspicuous is the dismantled thatch in a painted cottage of\nGainsborough, than the time-tangled and want-thinned locks of a beggar,\n_povertiresquely_ diversifying those snug little cabinet-pictures of the\nworld, which, exquisitely varnished and framed, are hung up in the\ndrawing-room minds of humane men of taste, and amiable philosophers of\neither the \"Compensation,\" or \"Optimist\" school. They deny that any\nmisery is in the world, except for the purpose of throwing the fine\n_povertiresque_ element into its general picture. Go to! God hath\ndeposited cash in the Bank subject to our gentlemanly order; he hath\nbounteously blessed the world with a summer carpet of green. Begone,\nHeraclitus! The lamentations of the rain are but to make us our\nrainbows!\n\nNot that in equivocal reference to the _povertiresque_ old farmer\nMillthorpe, Pierre is here intended to be hinted at. Still, man can not\nwholly escape his surroundings. Unconsciously Mrs. Glendinning had\nalways been one of these curious Optimists; and in his boyish life\nPierre had not wholly escaped the maternal contagion. Yet often, in\ncalling at the old farmer's for Charles of some early winter mornings,\nand meeting the painfully embarrassed, thin, feeble features of Mrs.\nMillthorpe, and the sadly inquisitive and hopelessly half-envious\nglances of the three little girls; and standing on the threshold, Pierre\nwould catch low, aged, life-weary groans from a recess out of sight\nfrom the door; then would Pierre have some boyish inklings of something\nelse than the pure _povertiresque_ in poverty: some inklings of what it\nmight be, to be old, and poor, and worn, and rheumatic, with shivering\ndeath drawing nigh, and present life itself but a dull and a chill! some\ninklings of what it might be, for him who in youth had vivaciously\nleaped from his bed, impatient to meet the earliest sun, and lose no\nsweet drop of his life, now hating the beams he once so dearly loved;\nturning round in his bed to the wall to avoid them; and still postponing\nthe foot which should bring him back to the dismal day; when the sun is\nnot gold, but copper; and the sky is not blue, but gray; and the blood,\nlike Rhenish wine, too long unquaffed by Death, grows thin and sour in\nthe veins.\n\nPierre had not forgotten that the augmented penury of the Millthorpe's\nwas, at the time we now retrospectively treat of, gravely imputed by the\ngossiping frequenters of the Black Swan Inn, to certain insinuated moral\nderelictions of the farmer. \"The old man tipped his elbow too often,\"\nonce said in Pierre's hearing an old bottle-necked fellow, performing\nthe identical same act with a half-emptied glass in his hand. But though\nthe form of old Millthorpe was broken, his countenance, however sad and\nthin, betrayed no slightest sign of the sot, either past or present. He\nnever was publicly known to frequent the inn, and seldom quitted the few\nacres he cultivated with his son. And though, alas, indigent enough, yet\nwas he most punctually honest in paying his little debts of shillings\nand pence for his groceries. And though, heaven knows, he had plenty of\noccasion for all the money he could possibly earn, yet Pierre\nremembered, that when, one autumn, a hog was bought of him for the\nservants' hall at the Mansion, the old man never called for his money\ntill the midwinter following; and then, as with trembling fingers he\neagerly clutched the silver, he unsteadily said, \"I have no use for it\nnow; it might just as well have stood over.\" It was then, that chancing\nto overhear this, Mrs. Glendinning had looked at the old man, with a\nkindly and benignantly interested eye to the _povertiresque_; and\nmurmured, \"Ah! the old English Knight is not yet out of his blood.\nBravo, old man!\"\n\nOne day, in Pierre's sight, nine silent figures emerged from the door of\nold Millthorpe; a coffin was put into a neighbor's farm-wagon; and a\nprocession, some thirty feet long, including the elongated pole and box\nof the wagon, wound along Saddle Meadows to a hill, where, at last, old\nMillthorpe was laid down in a bed, where the rising sun should affront\nhim no more. Oh, softest and daintiest of Holland linen is the motherly\nearth! There, beneath the sublime tester of the infinite sky, like\nemperors and kings, sleep, in grand state, the beggars and paupers of\nearth! I joy that Death is this Democrat; and hopeless of all other real\nand permanent democracies, still hug the thought, that though in life\nsome heads are crowned with gold, and some bound round with thorns, yet\nchisel them how they will, head-stones are all alike.\n\nThis somewhat particular account of the father of young Millthorpe, will\nbetter set forth the less immature condition and character of the son,\non whom had now descended the maintenance of his mother and sisters.\nBut, though the son of a farmer, Charles was peculiarly averse to hard\nlabor. It was not impossible that by resolute hard labor he might\neventually have succeeded in placing his family in a far more\ncomfortable situation than he had ever remembered them. But it was not\nso fated; the benevolent State had in its great wisdom decreed\notherwise.\n\nIn the village of Saddle Meadows there was an institution, half\ncommon-school and half academy, but mainly supported by a general\nordinance and financial provision of the government Here, not only were\nthe rudiments of an English education taught, but likewise some touch of\nbelles lettres, and composition, and that great American bulwark and\nbore--elocution. On the high-raised, stage platform of the Saddle\nMeadows Academy, the sons of the most indigent day-laborers were wont to\ndrawl out the fiery revolutionary rhetoric of Patrick Henry, or\ngesticulate impetuously through the soft cadences of Drake's \"Culprit\nFay.\" What wonder, then, that of Saturdays, when there was no elocution\nand poesy, these boys should grow melancholy and disdainful over the\nheavy, plodding handles of dung-forks and hoes?\n\nAt the age of fifteen, the ambition of Charles Millthorpe was to be\neither an orator, or a poet; at any rate, a great genius of one sort or\nother. He recalled the ancestral Knight, and indignantly spurned the\nplow. Detecting in him the first germ of this inclination, old\nMillthorpe had very seriously reasoned with his son; warning him against\nthe evils of his vagrant ambition. Ambition of that sort was either for\nundoubted genius, rich boys, or poor boys, standing entirely alone in\nthe world, with no one relying upon them. Charles had better consider\nthe case; his father was old and infirm; he could not last very long; he\nhad nothing to leave behind him but his plow and his hoe; his mother was\nsickly; his sisters pale and delicate; and finally, life was a fact, and\nthe winters in that part of the country exceedingly bitter and long.\nSeven months out of the twelve the pastures bore nothing, and all cattle\nmust be fed in the barns. But Charles was a boy; advice often seems the\nmost wantonly wasted of all human breath; man will not take wisdom on\ntrust; may be, it is well; for such wisdom is worthless; we must find\nthe true gem for ourselves; and so we go groping and groping for many\nand many a day.\n\nYet was Charles Millthorpe as affectionate and dutiful a boy as ever\nboasted of his brain, and knew not that he possessed a far more\nexcellent and angelical thing in the possession of a generous heart. His\nfather died; to his family he resolved to be a second father, and a\ncareful provider now. But not by hard toil of his hand; but by gentler\npractices of his mind. Already he had read many books--history, poetry,\nromance, essays, and all. The manorial book-shelves had often been\nhonored by his visits, and Pierre had kindly been his librarian. Not to\nlengthen the tale, at the age of seventeen, Charles sold the horse, the\ncow, the pig, the plow, the hoe, and almost every movable thing on the\npremises; and, converting all into cash, departed with his mother and\nsisters for the city; chiefly basing his expectations of success on some\nvague representations of an apothecary relative there resident. How he\nand his mother and sisters battled it out; how they pined and\nhalf-starved for a while; how they took in sewing; and Charles took in\ncopying; and all but scantily sufficed for a livelihood; all this may be\neasily imagined. But some mysterious latent good-will of Fate toward\nhim, had not only thus far kept Charles from the Poor-House, but had\nreally advanced his fortunes in a degree. At any rate, that certain\nharmless presumption and innocent egotism which have been previously\nadverted to as sharing in his general character, these had by no means\nretarded him; for it is often to be observed of the shallower men, that\nthey are the very last to despond. It is the glory of the bladder that\nnothing can sink it; it is the reproach of a box of treasure, that once\noverboard it must down.\n\n\nII.\n\nWhen arrived in the city, and discovering the heartless neglect of Glen,\nPierre,--looking about him for whom to apply to in this\nstrait,--bethought him of his old boy-companion Charlie, and went out to\nseek him, and found him at last; he saw before him, a tall, well-grown,\nbut rather thin and pale yet strikingly handsome young man of\ntwo-and-twenty; occupying a small dusty law-office on the third floor\nof the older building of the Apostles; assuming to be doing a very\nlarge, and hourly increasing business among empty pigeon-holes, and\ndirectly under the eye of an unopened bottle of ink; his mother and\nsisters dwelling in a chamber overhead; and himself, not only following\nthe law for a corporeal living, but likewise inter-linked with the\npeculiar secret, theologico-politico-social schemes of the masonic order\nof the seedy-coated Apostles; and pursuing some crude, transcendental\nPhilosophy, for both a contributory means of support, as well as for his\ncomplete intellectual aliment.\n\nPierre was at first somewhat startled by his exceedingly frank and\nfamiliar manner; all old manorial deference for Pierre was clean gone\nand departed; though at the first shock of their encounter, Charlie\ncould not possibly have known that Pierre was cast off.\n\n\"Ha, Pierre! glad to see you, my boy! Hark ye, next month I am to\ndeliver an address before the Omega order of the Apostles. The Grand\nMaster, Plinlimmon, will be there. I have heard on the best authority\nthat he once said of me--'That youth has the Primitive Categories in\nhim; he is destined to astonish the world.' Why, lad, I have received\npropositions from the Editors of the Spinozaist to contribute a weekly\ncolumn to their paper, and you know how very few can understand the\nSpinozaist; nothing is admitted there but the Ultimate Transcendentals.\nHark now, in your ear; I think of throwing off the Apostolic disguise\nand coming boldly out; Pierre! I think of stumping the State, and\npreaching our philosophy to the masses.--When did you arrive in town?\"\n\nSpite of all his tribulations, Pierre could not restrain a smile at this\nhighly diverting reception; but well knowing the youth, he did not\nconclude from this audacious burst of enthusiastic egotism that his\nheart had at all corroded; for egotism is one thing, and selfishness\nanother. No sooner did Pierre intimate his condition to him, than\nimmediately, Charlie was all earnest and practical kindness; recommended\nthe Apostles as the best possible lodgment for him,--cheap, snug, and\nconvenient to most public places; he offered to procure a cart and see\nhimself to the transport of Pierre's luggage; but finally thought it\nbest to mount the stairs and show him the vacant rooms. But when these\nat last were decided upon; and Charlie, all cheerfulness and alacrity,\nstarted with Pierre for the hotel, to assist him in the removal;\ngrasping his arm the moment they emerged from the great arched door\nunder the tower of the Apostles; he instantly launched into his amusing\nheroics, and continued the strain till the trunks were fairly in sight.\n\n\"Lord! my law-business overwhelms me! I must drive away some of my\nclients; I must have my exercise, and this ever-growing business denies\nit to me. Besides, I owe something to the sublime cause of the general\nhumanity; I must displace some of my briefs for my metaphysical\ntreatises. I can not waste all my oil over bonds and mortgages.--You\nsaid you were married, I think?\"\n\nBut without stopping for any reply, he rattled on. \"Well, I suppose it\nis wise after all. It settles, centralizes, and confirms a man, I have\nheard.--No, I didn't; it is a random thought of my own, that!--Yes, it\nmakes the world definite to him; it removes his morbid _sub_jectiveness,\nand makes all things _ob_jective; nine small children, for instance, may\nbe considered _ob_jective. Marriage, hey!--A fine thing, no doubt, no\ndoubt:--domestic--pretty--nice, all round. But I owe something to the\nworld, my boy! By marriage, I might contribute to the population of men,\nbut not to the census of mind. The great men are all bachelors, you\nknow. Their family is the universe: I should say the planet Saturn was\ntheir elder son; and Plato their uncle.--So you are married?\"\n\nBut again, reckless of answers, Charlie went on. \"Pierre, a thought, my\nboy;--a thought for you! You do not say it, but you hint of a low\npurse. Now I shall help you to fill it--Stump the State on the Kantian\nPhilosophy! A dollar a head, my boy! Pass round your beaver, and you'll\nget it. I have every confidence in the penetration and magnanimousness\nof the people! Pierre, hark in your ear;--it's my opinion the world is\nall wrong. Hist, I say--an entire mistake. Society demands an Avatar,--a\nCurtius, my boy! to leap into the fiery gulf, and by perishing himself,\nsave the whole empire of men! Pierre, I have long renounced the\nallurements of life and fashion. Look at my coat, and see how I spurn\nthem! Pierre! but, stop, have you ever a shilling! let's take a cold cut\nhere--it's a cheap place; I go here sometimes. Come, let's in.\"\n\n\n\n\nBOOK XXI.\n\nPIERRE IMMATURELY ATTEMPTS A MATURE WORK. TIDINGS FROM THE MEADOWS.\nPLINLIMMON.\n\n\nI.\n\nWe are now to behold Pierre permanently lodged in three lofty adjoining\nchambers of the Apostles. And passing on a little further in time, and\noverlooking the hundred and one domestic details, of how their internal\narrangements were finally put into steady working order; how poor Delly,\nnow giving over the sharper pangs of her grief, found in the lighter\noccupations of a handmaid and familiar companion to Isabel, the only\npractical relief from the memories of her miserable past; how Isabel\nherself in the otherwise occupied hours of Pierre, passed some of her\ntime in mastering the chirographical incoherencies of his manuscripts,\nwith a view to eventually copying them out in a legible hand for the\nprinter; or went below stairs to the rooms of the Millthorpes, and in\nthe modest and amiable society of the three young ladies and their\nexcellent mother, found some little solace for the absence of Pierre;\nor, when his day's work was done, sat by him in the twilight, and played\nher mystic guitar till Pierre felt chapter after chapter born of its\nwondrous suggestiveness; but alas! eternally incapable of being\ntranslated into words; for where the deepest words end, there music\nbegins with its supersensuous and all-confounding intimations.\n\nDisowning now all previous exertions of his mind, and burning in scorn\neven those fine fruits of a care-free fancy, which, written at Saddle\nMeadows in the sweet legendary time of Lucy and her love, he had\njealously kept from the publishers, as too true and good to be\npublished; renouncing all his foregone self, Pierre was now engaged in a\ncomprehensive compacted work, to whose speedy completion two tremendous\nmotives unitedly impelled;--the burning desire to deliver what he\nthought to be new, or at least miserably neglected Truth to the world;\nand the prospective menace of being absolutely penniless, unless by the\nsale of his book, he could realize money. Swayed to universality of\nthought by the widely-explosive mental tendencies of the profound events\nwhich had lately befallen him, and the unprecedented situation in which\nhe now found himself; and perceiving, by presentiment, that most grand\nproductions of the best human intellects ever are built round a circle,\nas atolls (_i. e._ the primitive coral islets which, raising themselves\nin the depths of profoundest seas, rise funnel-like to the surface, and\npresent there a hoop of white rock, which though on the outside\neverywhere lashed by the ocean, yet excludes all tempests from the quiet\nlagoon within), digestively including the whole range of all that can be\nknown or dreamed; Pierre was resolved to give the world a book, which\nthe world should hail with surprise and delight. A varied scope of\nreading, little suspected by his friends, and randomly acquired by a\nrandom but lynx-eyed mind, in the course of the multifarious,\nincidental, bibliographic encounterings of almost any civilized young\ninquirer after Truth; this poured one considerable contributary stream\ninto that bottomless spring of original thought which the occasion and\ntime had caused to burst out in himself. Now he congratulated himself\nupon all his cursory acquisitions of this sort; ignorant that in reality\nto a mind bent on producing some thoughtful thing of absolute Truth, all\nmere reading is apt to prove but an obstacle hard to overcome; and not\nan accelerator helpingly pushing him along.\n\nWhile Pierre was thinking that he was entirely transplanted into a new\nand wonderful element of Beauty and Power, he was, in fact, but in one\nof the stages of the transition. That ultimate element once fairly\ngained, then books no more are needed for buoys to our souls; our own\nstrong limbs support us, and we float over all bottomlessnesses with a\njeering impunity. He did not see,--or if he did, he could not yet name\nthe true cause for it,--that already, in the incipiency of his work, the\nheavy unmalleable element of mere book-knowledge would not congenially\nweld with the wide fluidness and ethereal airiness of spontaneous\ncreative thought. He would climb Parnassus with a pile of folios on his\nback. He did not see, that it was nothing at all to him, what other men\nhad written; that though Plato was indeed a transcendently great man in\nhimself, yet Plato must not be transcendently great to him (Pierre), so\nlong as he (Pierre himself) would also do something transcendently\ngreat. He did not see that there is no such thing as a standard for the\ncreative spirit; that no one great book must ever be separately\nregarded, and permitted to domineer with its own uniqueness upon the\ncreative mind; but that all existing great works must be federated in\nthe fancy; and so regarded as a miscellaneous and Pantheistic whole; and\nthen,--without at all dictating to his own mind, or unduly biasing it\nany way,--thus combined, they would prove simply an exhilarative and\nprovocative to him. He did not see, that even when thus combined, all\nwas but one small mite, compared to the latent infiniteness and\ninexhaustibility in himself; that all the great books in the world are\nbut the mutilated shadowings-forth of invisible and eternally unembodied\nimages in the soul; so that they are but the mirrors, distortedly\nreflecting to us our own things; and never mind what the mirror may be,\nif we would see the object, we must look at the object itself, and not\nat its reflection.\n\nBut, as to the resolute traveler in Switzerland, the Alps do never in\none wide and comprehensive sweep, instantaneously reveal their full\nawfulness of amplitude--their overawing extent of peak crowded on peak,\nand spur sloping on spur, and chain jammed behind chain, and all their\nwonderful battalionings of might; so hath heaven wisely ordained, that\non first entering into the Switzerland of his soul, man shall not at\nonce perceive its tremendous immensity; lest illy prepared for such an\nencounter, his spirit should sink and perish in the lowermost snows.\nOnly by judicious degrees, appointed of God, does man come at last to\ngain his Mont Blanc and take an overtopping view of these Alps; and even\nthen, the tithe is not shown; and far over the invisible Atlantic, the\nRocky Mountains and the Andes are yet unbeheld. Appalling is the soul of\na man! Better might one be pushed off into the material spaces beyond\nthe uttermost orbit of our sun, than once feel himself fairly afloat in\nhimself!\n\nBut not now to consider these ulterior things, Pierre, though strangely\nand very newly alive to many before unregarded wonders in the general\nworld; still, had he not as yet procured for himself that enchanter's\nwand of the soul, which but touching the humblest experiences in one's\nlife, straightway it starts up all eyes, in every one of which are\nendless significancies. Not yet had he dropped his angle into the well\nof his childhood, to find what fish might be there; for who dreams to\nfind fish in a well? the running stream of the outer world, there\ndoubtless swim the golden perch and the pickerel! Ten million things\nwere as yet uncovered to Pierre. The old mummy lies buried in cloth on\ncloth; it takes time to unwrap this Egyptian king. Yet now, forsooth,\nbecause Pierre began to see through the first superficiality of the\nworld, he fondly weens he has come to the unlayered substance. But, far\nas any geologist has yet gone down into the world, it is found to\nconsist of nothing but surface stratified on surface. To its axis, the\nworld being nothing but superinduced superficies. By vast pains we mine\ninto the pyramid; by horrible gropings we come to the central room; with\njoy we espy the sarcophagus; but we lift the lid--and no body is\nthere!--appallingly vacant as vast is the soul of a man!\n\n\nII.\n\nHe had been engaged some weeks upon his book--in pursuance of his\nsettled plan avoiding all contact with any of his city-connections or\nfriends, even as in his social downfall they sedulously avoided seeking\nhim out--nor ever once going or sending to the post-office, though it\nwas but a little round the corner from where he was, since having\ndispatched no letters himself, he expected none; thus isolated from the\nworld, and intent upon his literary enterprise, Pierre had passed some\nweeks, when verbal tidings came to him, of three most momentous events.\n\nFirst: his mother was dead.\n\nSecond: all Saddle Meadows was become Glen Stanly's.\n\nThird: Glen Stanly was believed to be the suitor of Lucy; who,\nconvalescent from an almost mortal illness, was now dwelling at her\nmother's house in town.\n\nIt was chiefly the first-mentioned of these events which darted a sharp\nnatural anguish into Pierre. No letter had come to him; no smallest ring\nor memorial been sent him; no slightest mention made of him in the will;\nand yet it was reported that an inconsolable grief had induced his\nmother's mortal malady, and driven her at length into insanity, which\nsuddenly terminated in death; and when he first heard of that event,\nshe had been cold in the ground for twenty-five days.\n\nHow plainly did all this speak of the equally immense pride and grief of\nhis once magnificent mother; and how agonizedly now did it hint of her\nmortally-wounded love for her only and best-beloved Pierre! In vain he\nreasoned with himself; in vain remonstrated with himself; in vain sought\nto parade all his stoic arguments to drive off the onslaught of natural\npassion. Nature prevailed; and with tears that like acid burned and\nscorched as they flowed, he wept, he raved, at the bitter loss of his\nparent; whose eyes had been closed by unrelated hands that were hired;\nbut whose heart had been broken, and whose very reason been ruined, by\nthe related hands of her son.\n\nFor some interval it almost seemed as if his own heart would snap; his\nown reason go down. Unendurable grief of a man, when Death itself gives\nthe stab, and then snatches all availments to solacement away. For in\nthe grave is no help, no prayer thither may go, no forgiveness thence\ncome; so that the penitent whose sad victim lies in the ground, for that\nuseless penitent his doom is eternal, and though it be Christmas-day\nwith all Christendom, with him it is Hell-day and an eaten liver\nforever.\n\nWith what marvelous precision and exactitude he now went over in his\nmind all the minutest details of his old joyous life with his mother at\nSaddle Meadows. He began with his own toilet in the morning; then his\nmild stroll into the fields; then his cheerful return to call his mother\nin her chamber; then the gay breakfast--and so on, and on, all through\nthe sweet day, till mother and son kissed, and with light, loving hearts\nseparated to their beds, to prepare themselves for still another day of\naffectionate delight. This recalling of innocence and joy in the hour of\nremorsefulness and woe; this is as heating red-hot the pincers that tear\nus. But in this delirium of his soul, Pierre could not define where\nthat line was, which separated the natural grief for the loss of a\nparent from that other one which was born of compunction. He strove hard\nto define it, but could not. He tried to cozen himself into believing\nthat all his grief was but natural, or if there existed any other, that\nmust spring--not from the consciousness of having done any possible\nwrong--but from the pang at what terrible cost the more exalted virtues\nare gained. Nor did he wholly fail in this endeavor. At last he\ndismissed his mother's memory into that same profound vault where\nhitherto had reposed the swooned form of his Lucy. But, as sometimes men\nare coffined in a trance, being thereby mistaken for dead; so it is\npossible to bury a tranced grief in the soul, erroneously supposing that\nit hath no more vitality of suffering. Now, immortal things only can\nbeget immortality. It would almost seem one presumptive argument for the\nendless duration of the human soul, that it is impossible in time and\nspace to kill any compunction arising from having cruelly injured a\ndeparted fellow-being.\n\nEre he finally committed his mother to the profoundest vault of his\nsoul, fain would he have drawn one poor alleviation from a circumstance,\nwhich nevertheless, impartially viewed, seemed equally capable either of\nsoothing or intensifying his grief. His mother's will, which without the\nleast mention of his own name, bequeathed several legacies to her\nfriends, and concluded by leaving all Saddle Meadows and its rent-rolls\nto Glendinning Stanly; this will bore the date of the day immediately\nsucceeding his fatal announcement on the landing of the stairs, of his\nassumed nuptials with Isabel. It plausibly pressed upon him, that as all\nthe evidences of his mother's dying unrelentingness toward him were\nnegative; and the only positive evidence--so to speak--of even that\nnegativeness, was the will which omitted all mention of Pierre;\ntherefore, as that will bore so significant a date, it must needs be\nmost reasonable to conclude, that it was dictated in the not yet\nsubsided transports of his mother's first indignation. But small\nconsolation was this, when he considered the final insanity of his\nmother; for whence that insanity but from a hate-grief unrelenting, even\nas his father must have become insane from a sin-grief irreparable? Nor\ndid this remarkable double-doom of his parents wholly fail to impress\nhis mind with presentiments concerning his own fate--his own hereditary\nliability to madness. Presentiment, I say; but what is a presentiment?\nhow shall you coherently define a presentiment, or how make any thing\nout of it which is at all lucid, unless you say that a presentiment is\nbut a judgment in disguise? And if a judgment in disguise, and yet\npossessing this preternaturalness of prophecy, how then shall you escape\nthe fateful conclusion, that you are helplessly held in the six hands of\nthe Sisters? For while still dreading your doom, you foreknow it. Yet\nhow foreknow and dread in one breath, unless with this divine seeming\npower of prescience, you blend the actual slimy powerlessness of\ndefense?\n\nThat his cousin, Glen Stanly, had been chosen by his mother to inherit\nthe domain of the Meadows, was not entirely surprising to Pierre. Not\nonly had Glen always been a favorite with his mother by reason of his\nsuperb person and his congeniality of worldly views with herself, but\nexcepting only Pierre, he was her nearest surviving blood relation; and\nmoreover, in his christian name, bore the hereditary syllables,\nGlendinning. So that if to any one but Pierre the Meadows must descend,\nGlen, on these general grounds, seemed the appropriate heir.\n\nBut it is not natural for a man, never mind who he may be, to see a\nnoble patrimony, rightfully his, go over to a soul-alien, and that alien\nonce his rival in love, and now his heartless, sneering foe; for so\nPierre could not but now argue of Glen; it is not natural for a man to\nsee this without singular emotions of discomfort and hate. Nor in Pierre\nwere these feelings at all soothed by the report of Glen's renewed\nattentions to Lucy. For there is something in the breast of almost\nevery man, which at bottom takes offense at the attentions of any other\nman offered to a woman, the hope of whose nuptial love he himself may\nhave discarded. Fain would a man selfishly appropriate all the hearts\nwhich have ever in any way confessed themselves his. Besides, in\nPierre's case, this resentment was heightened by Glen's previous\nhypocritical demeanor. For now all his suspicions seemed abundantly\nverified; and comparing all dates, he inferred that Glen's visit to\nEurope had only been undertaken to wear off the pang of his rejection by\nLucy, a rejection tacitly consequent upon her not denying her affianced\nrelation to Pierre.\n\nBut now, under the mask of profound sympathy--in time, ripening into\nlove--for a most beautiful girl, ruffianly deserted by her betrothed,\nGlen could afford to be entirely open in his new suit, without at all\nexposing his old scar to the world. So at least it now seemed to Pierre.\nMoreover, Glen could now approach Lucy under the most favorable possible\nauspices. He could approach her as a deeply sympathizing friend, all\nwishful to assuage her sorrow, but hinting nothing, at present, of any\nselfish matrimonial intent; by enacting this prudent and unclamorous\npart, the mere sight of such tranquil, disinterested, but indestructible\ndevotedness, could not but suggest in Lucy's mind, very natural\ncomparisons between Glen and Pierre, most deplorably abasing to the\nlatter. Then, no woman--as it would sometimes seem--no woman is utterly\nfree from the influence of a princely social position in her suitor,\nespecially if he be handsome and young. And Glen would come to her now\nthe master of two immense fortunes, and the heir, by voluntary election,\nno less than by blood propinquity, to the ancestral bannered hall, and\nthe broad manorial meadows of the Glendinnings. And thus, too, the\nspirit of Pierre's own mother would seem to press Glen's suit. Indeed,\nsituated now as he was Glen would seem all the finest part of Pierre,\nwithout any of Pierre's shame; would almost seem Pierre himself--what\nPierre had once been to Lucy. And as in the case of a man who has lost a\nsweet wife, and who long refuses the least consolation; as this man at\nlast finds a singular solace in the companionship of his wife's sister,\nwho happens to bear a peculiar family resemblance to the dead; and as\nhe, in the end, proposes marriage to this sister, merely from the force\nof such magical associative influences; so it did not seem wholly out of\nreason to suppose, that the great manly beauty of Glen, possessing a\nstrong related similitude to Pierre's, might raise in Lucy's heart\nassociations, which would lead her at least to seek--if she could not\nfind--solace for one now regarded as dead and gone to her forever, in\nthe devotedness of another, who would notwithstanding almost seem as\nthat dead one brought back to life.\n\nDeep, deep, and still deep and deeper must we go, if we would find out\nthe heart of a man; descending into which is as descending a spiral\nstair in a shaft, without any end, and where that endlessness is only\nconcealed by the spiralness of the stair, and the blackness of the\nshaft.\n\nAs Pierre conjured up this phantom of Glen transformed into the seeming\nsemblance of himself; as he figured it advancing toward Lucy and raising\nher hand in devotion; an infinite quenchless rage and malice possessed\nhim. Many commingled emotions combined to provoke this storm. But chief\nof all was something strangely akin to that indefinable detestation\nwhich one feels for any impostor who has dared to assume one's own name\nand aspect in any equivocal or dishonorable affair; an emotion greatly\nintensified if this impostor be known for a mean villain at bottom, and\nalso, by the freak of nature to be almost the personal duplicate of the\nman whose identity he assumes. All these and a host of other distressful\nand resentful fancies now ran through the breast of Pierre. All his\nFaith-born, enthusiastic, high-wrought, stoic, and philosophic defenses,\nwere now beaten down by this sudden storm of nature in his soul. For\nthere is no faith, and no stoicism, and no philosophy, that a mortal man\ncan possibly evoke, which will stand the final test of a real\nimpassioned onset of Life and Passion upon him. Then all the fair\nphilosophic or Faith-phantoms that he raised from the mist, slide away\nand disappear as ghosts at cock-crow. For Faith and philosophy are air,\nbut events are brass. Amidst his gray philosophizings, Life breaks upon\na man like a morning.\n\nWhile this mood was on him, Pierre cursed himself for a heartless\nvillain and an idiot fool;--heartless villain, as the murderer of his\nmother--idiot fool, because he had thrown away all his felicity; because\nhe had himself, as it were, resigned his noble birthright to a cunning\nkinsman for a mess of pottage, which now proved all but ashes in his\nmouth.\n\nResolved to hide these new, and--as it latently seemed to him--unworthy\npangs, from Isabel, as also their cause, he quitted his chamber,\nintending a long vagabond stroll in the suburbs of the town, to wear off\nhis sharper grief, ere he should again return into her sight.\n\n\nIII.\n\nAs Pierre, now hurrying from his chamber, was rapidly passing through\none of the higher brick colonnades connecting the ancient building with\nthe modern, there advanced toward him from the direction of the latter,\na very plain, composed, manly figure, with a countenance rather pale if\nany thing, but quite clear and without wrinkle. Though the brow and the\nbeard, and the steadiness of the head and settledness of the step\nindicated mature age, yet the blue, bright, but still quiescent eye\noffered a very striking contrast. In that eye, the gay immortal youth\nApollo, seemed enshrined; while on that ivory-throned brow, old Saturn\ncross-legged sat. The whole countenance of this man, the whole air and\nlook of this man, expressed a cheerful content. Cheerful is the\nadjective, for it was the contrary of gloom; content--perhaps\nacquiescence--is the substantive, for it was not Happiness or Delight.\nBut while the personal look and air of this man were thus winning, there\nwas still something latently visible in him which repelled. That\nsomething may best be characterized as non-Benevolence. Non-Benevolence\nseems the best word, for it was neither Malice nor Ill-will; but\nsomething passive. To crown all, a certain floating atmosphere seemed to\ninvest and go along with this man. That atmosphere seems only renderable\nin words by the term Inscrutableness. Though the clothes worn by this\nman were strictly in accordance with the general style of any\nunobtrusive gentleman's dress, yet his clothes seemed to disguise this\nman. One would almost have said, his very face, the apparently natural\nglance of his very eye disguised this man.\n\nNow, as this person deliberately passed by Pierre, he lifted his hat,\ngracefully bowed, smiled gently, and passed on. But Pierre was all\nconfusion; he flushed, looked askance, stammered with his hand at his\nhat to return the courtesy of the other; he seemed thoroughly upset by\nthe mere sight of this hat-lifting, gracefully bowing, gently-smiling,\nand most miraculously self-possessed, non-benevolent man.\n\nNow who was this man? This man was Plotinus Plinlimmon. Pierre had read\na treatise of his in a stage-coach coming to the city, and had heard him\noften spoken of by Millthorpe and others as the Grand Master of a\ncertain mystic Society among the Apostles. Whence he came, no one could\ntell. His surname was Welsh, but he was a Tennesseean by birth. He\nseemed to have no family or blood ties of any sort. He never was known\nto work with his hands; never to write with his hands (he would not even\nwrite a letter); he never was known to open a book. There were no books\nin his chamber. Nevertheless, some day or other he must have read books,\nbut that time seemed gone now; as for the sleazy works that went under\nhis name, they were nothing more than his verbal things, taken down at\nrandom, and bunglingly methodized by his young disciples.\n\nFinding Plinlimmon thus unfurnished either with books or pen and paper,\nand imputing it to something like indigence, a foreign scholar, a rich\nnobleman, who chanced to meet him once, sent him a fine supply of\nstationery, with a very fine set of volumes,--Cardan, Epictetus, the\nBook of Mormon, Abraham Tucker, Condorcet and the Zenda-Vesta. But this\nnoble foreign scholar calling next day--perhaps in expectation of some\ncompliment for his great kindness--started aghast at his own package\ndeposited just without the door of Plinlimmon, and with all fastenings\nuntouched.\n\n\"Missent,\" said Plotinus Plinlimmon placidly: \"if any thing, I looked\nfor some choice Cura\u00c3\u00a7oa from a nobleman like you. I should be very\nhappy, my dear Count, to accept a few jugs of choice Cura\u00c3\u00a7oa.\"\n\n\"I thought that the society of which you are the head, excluded all\nthings of that sort\"--replied the Count.\n\n\"Dear Count, so they do; but Mohammed hath his own dispensation.\"\n\n\"Ah! I see,\" said the noble scholar archly.\n\n\"I am afraid you do not see, dear Count\"--said Plinlimmon; and instantly\nbefore the eyes of the Count, the inscrutable atmosphere eddied and\neddied roundabout this Plotinus Plinlimmon.\n\nHis chance brushing encounter in the corridor was the first time that\never Pierre had without medium beheld the form or the face of\nPlinlimmon. Very early after taking chambers at the Apostles', he had\nbeen struck by a steady observant blue-eyed countenance at one of the\nloftiest windows of the old gray tower, which on the opposite side of\nthe quadrangular space, rose prominently before his own chamber. Only\nthrough two panes of glass--his own and the stranger's--had Pierre\nhitherto beheld that remarkable face of repose,--repose neither divine\nnor human, nor any thing made up of either or both--but a repose\nseparate and apart--a repose of a face by itself. One adequate look at\nthat face conveyed to most philosophical observers a notion of something\nnot before included in their scheme of the Universe.\n\nNow as to the mild sun, glass is no hindrance at all, but he transmits\nhis light and life through the glass; even so through Pierre's panes did\nthe tower face transmit its strange mystery.\n\nBecoming more and more interested in this face, he had questioned\nMillthorpe concerning it \"Bless your soul\"--replied Millthorpe--\"that is\nPlotinus Plinlimmon! our Grand Master, Plotinus Plinlimmon! By gad, you\nmust know Plotinus thoroughly, as I have long done. Come away with me,\nnow, and let me introduce you instanter to Plotinus Plinlimmon.\"\n\nBut Pierre declined; and could not help thinking, that though in all\nhuman probability Plotinus well understood Millthorpe, yet Millthorpe\ncould hardly yet have wound himself into Plotinus;--though indeed\nPlotinus--who at times was capable of assuming a very off-hand,\nconfidential, and simple, sophomorean air--might, for reasons best known\nto himself, have tacitly pretended to Millthorpe, that he (Millthorpe)\nhad thoroughly wriggled himself into his (Plotinus') innermost soul.\n\nA man will be given a book, and when the donor's back is turned, will\ncarelessly drop it in the first corner; he is not over-anxious to be\nbothered with the book. But now personally point out to him the author,\nand ten to one he goes back to the corner, picks up the book, dusts the\ncover, and very carefully reads that invaluable work. One does not\nvitally believe in a man till one's own two eyes have beheld him. If\nthen, by the force of peculiar circumstances, Pierre while in the\nstage, had formerly been drawn into an attentive perusal of the work on\n\"Chronometricals and Horologicals;\" how then was his original interest\nheightened by catching a subsequent glimpse of the author. But at the\nfirst reading, not being able--as he thought--to master the pivot-idea\nof the pamphlet; and as every incomprehended idea is not only a\nperplexity but a taunting reproach to one's mind, Pierre had at last\nceased studying it altogether; nor consciously troubled himself further\nabout it during the remainder of the journey. But still thinking now it\nmight possibly have been mechanically retained by him, he searched all\nthe pockets of his clothes, but without success. He begged Millthorpe to\ndo his best toward procuring him another copy; but it proved impossible\nto find one. Plotinus himself could not furnish it.\n\nAmong other efforts, Pierre in person had accosted a limping half-deaf\nold book-stall man, not very far from the Apostles'. \"Have you the\n'_Chronometrics_,' my friend?\" forgetting the exact title.\n\n\"Very bad, very bad!\" said the old man, rubbing his back;--\"has had the\n_chronic-rheumatics_ ever so long; what's good for 'em?\"\n\nPerceiving his mistake, Pierre replied that he did not know what was the\ninfallible remedy.\n\n\"Whist! let me tell ye, then, young 'un,\" said the old cripple, limping\nclose up to him, and putting his mouth in Pierre's ear--\"Never catch\n'em!--now's the time, while you're young:--never catch 'em!\"\n\nBy-and-by the blue-eyed, mystic-mild face in the upper window of the old\ngray tower began to domineer in a very remarkable manner upon Pierre.\nWhen in his moods of peculiar depression and despair; when dark thoughts\nof his miserable condition would steal over him; and black doubts as to\nthe integrity of his unprecedented course in life would most\nmalignantly suggest themselves; when a thought of the vanity of his\ndeep book would glidingly intrude; if glancing at his closet-window that\nmystic-mild face met Pierre's; under any of these influences the effect\nwas surprising, and not to be adequately detailed in any possible words.\n\nVain! vain! vain! said the face to him. Fool! fool! fool! said the face\nto him. Quit! quit! quit! said the face to him. But when he mentally\ninterrogated the face as to why it thrice said Vain! Fool! Quit! to him;\nhere there was no response. For that face did not respond to any thing.\nDid I not say before that that face was something separate, and apart; a\nface by itself? Now, any thing which is thus a thing by itself never\nresponds to any other thing. If to affirm, be to expand one's isolated\nself; and if to deny, be to contract one's isolated self; then to\nrespond is a suspension of all isolation. Though this face in the tower\nwas so clear and so mild; though the gay youth Apollo was enshrined in\nthat eye, and paternal old Saturn sat cross-legged on that ivory brow;\nyet somehow to Pierre the face at last wore a sort of malicious leer to\nhim. But the Kantists might say, that this was a _subjective_ sort of\nleer in Pierre. Any way, the face seemed to leer upon Pierre. And now it\nsaid to him--_Ass! ass! ass!_ This expression was insufferable. He\nprocured some muslin for his closet-window; and the face became\ncurtained like any portrait. But this did not mend the leer. Pierre knew\nthat still the face leered behind the muslin. What was most terrible was\nthe idea that by some magical means or other the face had got hold of\nhis secret. \"Ay,\" shuddered Pierre, \"the face knows that Isabel is not\nmy wife! And that seems the reason it leers.\"\n\nThen would all manner of wild fancyings float through his soul, and\ndetached sentences of the \"Chronometrics\" would vividly recur to\nhim--sentences before but imperfectly comprehended, but now shedding a\nstrange, baleful light upon his peculiar condition, and emphatically\ndenouncing it. Again he tried his best to procure the pamphlet, to read\nit now by the commentary of the mystic-mild face; again he searched\nthrough the pockets of his clothes for the stage-coach copy, but in\nvain.\n\nAnd when--at the critical moment of quitting his chambers that morning\nof the receipt of the fatal tidings--the face itself--the man\nhimself--this inscrutable Plotinus Plinlimmon himself--did visibly brush\nby him in the brick corridor, and all the trepidation he had ever before\nfelt at the mild-mystic aspect in the tower window, now redoubled upon\nhim, so that, as before said, he flushed, looked askance, and stammered\nwith his saluting hand to his hat;--then anew did there burn in him the\ndesire of procuring the pamphlet. \"Cursed fate that I should have lost\nit\"--he cried;--\"more cursed, that when I did have it, and did read it,\nI was such a ninny as not to comprehend; and now it is all too late!\"\n\nYet--to anticipate here--when years after, an old Jew Clothesman\nrummaged over a surtout of Pierre's--which by some means had come into\nhis hands--his lynx-like fingers happened to feel something foreign\nbetween the cloth and the heavy quilted bombazine lining. He ripped open\nthe skirt, and found several old pamphlet pages, soft and worn almost to\ntissue, but still legible enough to reveal the title--\"Chronometricals\nand Horologicals.\" Pierre must have ignorantly thrust it into his\npocket, in the stage, and it had worked through a rent there, and worked\nits way clean down into the skirt, and there helped pad the padding. So\nthat all the time he was hunting for this pamphlet, he himself was\nwearing the pamphlet. When he brushed past Plinlimmon in the brick\ncorridor, and felt that renewed intense longing for the pamphlet, then\nhis right hand was not two inches from the pamphlet.\n\nPossibly this curious circumstance may in some sort illustrate his\nself-supposed non-understanding of the pamphlet, as first read by him\nin the stage. Could he likewise have carried about with him in his mind\nthe thorough understanding of the book, and yet not be aware that he so\nunderstood it? I think that--regarded in one light--the final career of\nPierre will seem to show, that he _did_ understand it. And here it may\nbe randomly suggested, by way of bagatelle, whether some things that men\nthink they do not know, are not for all that thoroughly comprehended by\nthem; and yet, so to speak, though contained in themselves, are kept a\nsecret from themselves? The idea of Death seems such a thing.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK XXII.\n\nTHE FLOWER-CURTAIN LIFTED FROM BEFORE A TROPICAL AUTHOR, WITH SOME\nREMARKS ON THE TRANSCENDENTAL FLESH-BRUSH PHILOSOPHY.\n\n\nI.\n\nSome days passed after the fatal tidings from the Meadows, and at\nlength, somewhat mastering his emotions, Pierre again sits down in his\nchamber; for grieve how he will, yet work he must. And now day succeeds\nday, and week follows week, and Pierre still sits in his chamber. The\nlong rows of cooled brick-kilns around him scarce know of the change;\nbut from the fair fields of his great-great-great-grandfather's manor,\nSummer hath flown like a swallow-guest; the perfidious wight, Autumn,\nhath peeped in at the groves of the maple, and under pretense of\nclothing them in rich russet and gold, hath stript them at last of the\nslightest rag, and then ran away laughing; prophetic icicles depend from\nthe arbors round about the old manorial mansion--now locked up and\nabandoned; and the little, round, marble table in the viny summer-house\nwhere, of July mornings, he had sat chatting and drinking negus with his\ngay mother, is now spread with a shivering napkin of frost; sleety\nvarnish hath encrusted that once gay mother's grave, preparing it for\nits final cerements of wrapping snow upon snow; wild howl the winds in\nthe woods: it is Winter. Sweet Summer is done; and Autumn is done; but\nthe book, like the bitter winter, is yet to be finished.\n\nThat season's wheat is long garnered, Pierre; that season's ripe apples\nand grapes are in; no crop, no plant, no fruit is out; the whole harvest\nis done. Oh, woe to that belated winter-overtaken plant, which the\nsummer could not bring to maturity! The drifting winter snows shall\nwhelm it. Think, Pierre, doth not thy plant belong to some other and\ntropical clime? Though transplanted to northern Maine, the orange-tree\nof the Floridas will put forth leaves in that parsimonious summer, and\nshow some few tokens of fruitage; yet November will find no golden\nglobes thereon; and the passionate old lumber-man, December, shall peel\nthe whole tree, wrench it off at the ground, and toss it for a fagot to\nsome lime-kiln. Ah, Pierre, Pierre, make haste! make haste! force thy\nfruitage, lest the winter force thee.\n\nWatch yon little toddler, how long it is learning to stand by itself!\nFirst it shrieks and implores, and will not try to stand at all, unless\nboth father and mother uphold it; then a little more bold, it must, at\nleast, feel one parental hand, else again the cry and the tremble; long\ntime is it ere by degrees this child comes to stand without any support.\nBut, by-and-by, grown up to man's estate, it shall leave the very mother\nthat bore it, and the father that begot it, and cross the seas, perhaps,\nor settle in far Oregon lands. There now, do you see the soul. In its\ngerm on all sides it is closely folded by the world, as the husk folds\nthe tenderest fruit; then it is born from the world-husk, but still now\noutwardly clings to it;--still clamors for the support of its mother the\nworld, and its father the Deity. But it shall yet learn to stand\nindependent, though not without many a bitter wail, and many a miserable\nfall.\n\nThat hour of the life of a man when first the help of humanity fails\nhim, and he learns that in his obscurity and indigence humanity holds\nhim a dog and no man: that hour is a hard one, but not the hardest.\nThere is still another hour which follows, when he learns that in his\ninfinite comparative minuteness and abjectness, the gods do likewise\ndespise him, and own him not of their clan. Divinity and humanity then\nare equally willing that he should starve in the street for all that\neither will do for him. Now cruel father and mother have both let go his\nhand, and the little soul-toddler, now you shall hear his shriek and his\nwail, and often his fall.\n\nWhen at Saddle Meadows, Pierre had wavered and trembled in those first\nwretched hours ensuing upon the receipt of Isabel's letter; then\nhumanity had let go the hand of Pierre, and therefore his cry; but when\nat last inured to this, Pierre was seated at his book, willing that\nhumanity should desert him, so long as he thought he felt a far higher\nsupport; then, ere long, he began to feel the utter loss of that other\nsupport, too; ay, even the paternal gods themselves did now desert\nPierre; the toddler was toddling entirely alone, and not without\nshrieks.\n\nIf man must wrestle, perhaps it is well that it should be on the\nnakedest possible plain.\n\nThe three chambers of Pierre at the Apostles' were connecting ones. The\nfirst--having a little retreat where Delly slept--was used for the more\nexacting domestic purposes: here also their meals were taken; the second\nwas the chamber of Isabel; the third was the closet of Pierre. In the\nfirst--the dining room, as they called it--there was a stove which\nboiled the water for their coffee and tea, and where Delly concocted\ntheir light repasts. This was their only fire; for, warned again and\nagain to economize to the uttermost, Pierre did not dare to purchase any\nadditional warmth. But by prudent management, a very little warmth may\ngo a great way. In the present case, it went some forty feet or more. A\nhorizontal pipe, after elbowing away from above the stove in the\ndining-room, pierced the partition wall, and passing straight through\nIsabel's chamber, entered the closet of Pierre at one corner, and then\nabruptly disappeared into the wall, where all further caloric--if\nany--went up through the chimney into the air, to help warm the\nDecember sun. Now, the great distance of Pierre's calorical stream from\nits fountain, sadly impaired it, and weakened it. It hardly had the\nflavor of heat. It would have had but very inconsiderable influence in\nraising the depressed spirits of the most mercurial thermometer;\ncertainly it was not very elevating to the spirits of Pierre. Besides,\nthis calorical stream, small as it was, did not flow through the room,\nbut only entered it, to elbow right out of it, as some coquettish\nmaidens enter the heart; moreover, it was in the furthest corner from\nthe only place where, with a judicious view to the light, Pierre's\ndesk-barrels and board could advantageously stand. Often, Isabel\ninsisted upon his having a separate stove to himself; but Pierre would\nnot listen to such a thing. Then Isabel would offer her own room to him;\nsaying it was of no indispensable use to her by day; she could easily\nspend her time in the dining-room; but Pierre would not listen to such a\nthing; he would not deprive her of the comfort of a continually\naccessible privacy; besides, he was now used to his own room, and must\nsit by that particular window there, and no other. Then Isabel would\ninsist upon keeping her connecting door open while Pierre was employed\nat his desk, that so the heat of her room might bodily go into his; but\nPierre would not listen to such a thing: because he must be religiously\nlocked up while at work; outer love and hate must alike be excluded\nthen. In vain Isabel said she would make not the slightest noise, and\nmuffle the point of the very needle she used. All in vain. Pierre was\ninflexible here.\n\nYes, he was resolved to battle it out in his own solitary closet; though\na strange, transcendental conceit of one of the more erratic and\nnon-conforming Apostles,--who was also at this time engaged upon a\nprofound work above stairs, and who denied himself his full sufficiency\nof food, in order to insure an abundant fire;--the strange conceit of\nthis Apostle, I say,--accidentally communicated to Pierre,--that,\nthrough all the kingdoms of Nature, caloric was the great universal\nproducer and vivifyer, and could not be prudently excluded from the spot\nwhere great books were in the act of creation; and therefore, he (the\nApostle) for one, was resolved to plant his head in a hot-bed of\nstove-warmed air, and so force his brain to germinate and blossom, and\nbud, and put forth the eventual, crowning, victorious flower;--though\nindeed this conceit rather staggered Pierre--for in truth, there was no\nsmall smack of plausible analogy in it--yet one thought of his purse\nwould wholly expel the unwelcome intrusion, and reinforce his own\nprevious resolve.\n\nHowever lofty and magnificent the movements of the stars; whatever\ncelestial melodies they may thereby beget; yet the astronomers assure us\nthat they are the most rigidly methodical of all the things that exist.\nNo old housewife goes her daily domestic round with one millionth part\nthe precision of the great planet Jupiter in his stated and unalterable\nrevolutions. He has found his orbit, and stays in it; he has timed\nhimself, and adheres to his periods. So, in some degree with Pierre, now\nrevolving in the troubled orbit of his book.\n\nPierre rose moderately early; and the better to inure himself to the\npermanent chill of his room, and to defy and beard to its face, the\ncruelest cold of the outer air; he would--behind the curtain--throw down\nthe upper sash of his window; and on a square of old painted canvas,\nformerly wrapping some bale of goods in the neighborhood, treat his\nlimbs, of those early December mornings, to a copious ablution, in water\nthickened with incipient ice. Nor, in this stoic performance, was he at\nall without company,--not present, but adjoiningly sympathetic; for\nscarce an Apostle in all those scores and scores of chambers, but\nundeviatingly took his daily December bath. Pierre had only to peep out\nof his pane and glance round the multi-windowed, inclosing walls of the\nquadrangle, to catch plentiful half-glimpses, all round him, of many a\nlean, philosophical nudity, refreshing his meager bones with crash-towel\nand cold water. \"Quick be the play,\" was their motto: \"Lively our\nelbows, and nimble all our tenuities.\" Oh, the dismal echoings of the\nraspings of flesh-brushes, perverted to the filing and polishing of the\nmerest ribs! Oh, the shuddersome splashings of pails of ice-water over\nfeverish heads, not unfamiliar with aches! Oh, the rheumatical\ncracklings of rusted joints, in that defied air of December! for every\nthick-frosted sash was down, and every lean nudity courted the zephyr!\n\nAmong all the innate, hyena-like repellants to the reception of any set\nform of a spiritually-minded and pure archetypical faith, there is\nnothing so potent in its skeptical tendencies, as that inevitable\nperverse ridiculousness, which so often bestreaks some of the\nessentially finest and noblest aspirations of those men, who disgusted\nwith the common conventional quackeries, strive, in their clogged\nterrestrial humanities, after some imperfectly discerned, but heavenly\nideals: ideals, not only imperfectly discerned in themselves, but the\npath to them so little traceable, that no two minds will entirely agree\nupon it.\n\nHardly a new-light Apostle, but who, in superaddition to his\nrevolutionary scheme for the minds and philosophies of men, entertains\nsome insane, heterodoxical notions about the economy of his body. His\nsoul, introduced by the gentlemanly gods, into the supernal\nsociety,--practically rejects that most sensible maxim of men of the\nworld, who chancing to gain the friendship of any great character, never\nmake that the ground of boring him with the supplemental acquaintance of\ntheir next friend, who perhaps, is some miserable ninny. Love me, love\nmy dog, is only an adage for the old country-women who affectionately\nkiss their cows. The gods love the soul of a man; often, they will\nfrankly accost it; but they abominate his body; and will forever cut it\ndead, both here and hereafter. So, if thou wouldst go to the gods,\nleave thy dog of a body behind thee. And most impotently thou strivest\nwith thy purifying cold baths, and thy diligent scrubbings with\nflesh-brushes, to prepare it as a meet offering for their altar. Nor\nshall all thy Pythagorean and Shellian dietings on apple-parings, dried\nprunes, and crumbs of oat-meal cracker, ever fit thy body for heaven.\nFeed all things with food convenient for them,--that is, if the food be\nprocurable. The food of thy soul is light and space; feed it then on\nlight and space. But the food of thy body is champagne and oysters; feed\nit then on champagne and oysters; and so shall it merit a joyful\nresurrection, if there is any to be. Say, wouldst thou rise with a\nlantern jaw and a spavined knee? Rise with brawn on thee, and a most\nroyal corporation before thee; so shalt thou in that day claim\nrespectful attention. Know this: that while many a consumptive dietarian\nhas but produced the merest literary flatulencies to the world;\nconvivial authors have alike given utterance to the sublimest wisdom,\nand created the least gross and most ethereal forms. And for men of\ndemonstrative muscle and action, consider that right royal epitaph which\nCyrus the Great caused to be engraved on his tomb--\"I could drink a\ngreat deal of wine, and it did me a great deal of good.\" Ah, foolish! to\nthink that by starving thy body, thou shalt fatten thy soul! Is yonder\nox fatted because yonder lean fox starves in the winter wood? And prate\nnot of despising thy body, while still thou flourisheth thy flesh-brush!\nThe finest houses are most cared for within; the outer walls are freely\nleft to the dust and the soot. Put venison in thee, and so wit shall\ncome out of thee. It is one thing in the mill, but another in the sack.\n\nNow it was the continual, quadrangular example of those forlorn fellows,\nthe Apostles, who, in this period of his half-developments and\ntransitions, had deluded Pierre into the Flesh-Brush Philosophy, and had\nalmost tempted him into the Apple-Parings Dialectics. For all the long\nwards, corridors, and multitudinous chambers of the Apostles' were\nscattered with the stems of apples, the stones of prunes, and the shells\nof peanuts. They went about huskily muttering the Kantian Categories\nthrough teeth and lips dry and dusty as any miller's, with the crumbs of\nGraham crackers. A tumbler of cold water was the utmost welcome to their\nreception rooms; at the grand supposed Sanhedrim presided over by one of\nthe deputies of Plotinus Plinlimmon, a huge jug of Adam's Ale, and a\nbushel-basket of Graham crackers were the only convivials. Continually\nbits of cheese were dropping from their pockets, and old shiny apple\nparchments were ignorantly exhibited every time they drew out a\nmanuscript to read you. Some were curious in the vintages of waters; and\nin three glass decanters set before you, Fairmount, Croton, and\nCochituate; they held that Croton was the most potent, Fairmount a\ngentle tonic, and Cochituate the mildest and least inebriating of all.\nTake some more of the Croton, my dear sir! Be brisk with the Fairmount!\nWhy stops that Cochituate? So on their philosophical tables went round\ntheir Port, their Sherry, and their Claret.\n\nSome, further advanced, rejected mere water in the bath, as altogether\ntoo coarse an element; and so, took to the Vapor-baths, and steamed\ntheir lean ribs every morning. The smoke which issued from their heads,\nand overspread their pages, was prefigured in the mists that issued from\nunder their door-sills and out of their windows. Some could not sit down\nof a morning until after first applying the Vapor-bath outside and then\nthoroughly rinsing out their interiors with five cups of cold Croton.\nThey were as faithfully replenished fire-buckets; and could they,\nstanding in one cordon, have consecutively pumped themselves into each\nother, then the great fire of 1835 had been far less wide-spread and\ndisastrous.\n\nAh! ye poor lean ones! ye wretched Soakites and Vaporites! have not your\nniggardly fortunes enough rinsed ye out, and wizened ye, but ye must\nstill be dragging the hose-pipe, and throwing still more cold Croton on\nyourselves and the world? Ah! attach the screw of your hose-pipe to some\nfine old butt of Madeira! pump us some sparkling wine into the world!\nsee, see, already, from all eternity, two-thirds of it have lain\nhelplessly soaking!\n\n\nII.\n\nWith cheek rather pale, then, and lips rather blue, Pierre sits down to\nhis plank.\n\nBut is Pierre packed in the mail for St. Petersburg this morning? Over\nhis boots are his moccasins; over his ordinary coat is his surtout; and\nover that, a cloak of Isabel's. Now he is squared to his plank; and at\nhis hint, the affectionate Isabel gently pushes his chair closer to it,\nfor he is so muffled, he can hardly move of himself. Now Delly comes in\nwith bricks hot from the stove; and now Isabel and she with devoted\nsolicitude pack away these comforting stones in the folds of an old blue\ncloak, a military garment of the grandfather of Pierre, and tenderly\narrange it both over and under his feet; but putting the warm flagging\nbeneath. Then Delly brings still another hot brick to put under his\ninkstand, to prevent the ink from thickening. Then Isabel drags the\ncamp-bedstead nearer to him, on which are the two or three books he may\npossibly have occasion to refer to that day, with a biscuit or two, and\nsome water, and a clean towel, and a basin. Then she leans against the\nplank by the elbow of Pierre, a crook-ended stick. Is Pierre a shepherd,\nor a bishop, or a cripple? No, but he has in effect, reduced himself to\nthe miserable condition of the last. With the crook-ended cane,\nPierre--unable to rise without sadly impairing his manifold\nintrenchments, and admitting the cold air into their innermost\nnooks,--Pierre, if in his solitude, he should chance to need any thing\nbeyond the reach of his arm, then the crook-ended cane drags it to his\nimmediate vicinity.\n\nPierre glances slowly all round him; every thing seems to be right; he\nlooks up with a grateful, melancholy satisfaction at Isabel; a tear\ngathers in her eye; but she conceals it from him by coming very close to\nhim, stooping over, and kissing his brow. 'Tis her lips that leave the\nwarm moisture there; not her tears, she says.\n\n\"I suppose I must go now, Pierre. Now don't, don't be so long to-day. I\nwill call thee at half-past four. Thou shalt not strain thine eyes in\nthe twilight.\"\n\n\"We will _see_ about that,\" says Pierre, with an unobserved attempt at a\nvery sad pun. \"Come, thou must go. Leave me.\"\n\nAnd there he is left.\n\nPierre is young; heaven gave him the divinest, freshest form of a man;\nput light into his eye, and fire into his blood, and brawn into his arm,\nand a joyous, jubilant, overflowing, upbubbling, universal life in him\neverywhere. Now look around in that most miserable room, and at that\nmost miserable of all the pursuits of a man, and say if here be the\nplace, and this be the trade, that God intended him for. A rickety\nchair, two hollow barrels, a plank, paper, pens, and infernally black\nink, four leprously dingy white walls, no carpet, a cup of water, and a\ndry biscuit or two. Oh, I hear the leap of the Texan Camanche, as at\nthis moment he goes crashing like a wild deer through the green\nunderbrush; I hear his glorious whoop of savage and untamable health;\nand then I look in at Pierre. If physical, practical unreason make the\nsavage, which is he? Civilization, Philosophy, Ideal Virtue! behold your\nvictim!\n\n\nIII.\n\nSome hours pass. Let us peep over the shoulder of Pierre, and see what\nit is he is writing there, in that most melancholy closet. Here, topping\nthe reeking pile by his side, is the last sheet from his hand, the\nfrenzied ink not yet entirely dry. It is much to our purpose; for in\nthis sheet, he seems to have directly plagiarized from his own\nexperiences, to fill out the mood of his apparent author-hero, Vivia,\nwho thus soliloquizes: \"A deep-down, unutterable mournfulness is in me.\nNow I drop all humorous or indifferent disguises, and all philosophical\npretensions. I own myself a brother of the clod, a child of the Primeval\nGloom. Hopelessness and despair are over me, as pall on pall. Away, ye\nchattering apes of a sophomorean Spinoza and Plato, who once didst all\nbut delude me that the night was day, and pain only a tickle. Explain\nthis darkness, exorcise this devil, ye can not. Tell me not, thou\ninconceivable coxcomb of a Goethe, that the universe can not spare thee\nand thy immortality, so long as--like a hired waiter--thou makest\nthyself 'generally useful.' Already the universe gets on without thee,\nand could still spare a million more of the same identical kidney.\nCorporations have no souls, and thy Pantheism, what was that? Thou wert\nbut the pretensious, heartless part of a man. Lo! I hold thee in this\nhand, and thou art crushed in it like an egg from which the meat hath\nbeen sucked.\"\n\nHere is a slip from the floor.\n\n\"Whence flow the panegyrical melodies that precede the march of these\nheroes? From what but from a sounding brass and a tinkling cymbal!\"\n\nAnd here is a second.\n\n\"Cast thy eye in there on Vivia; tell me why those four limbs should be\nclapt in a dismal jail--day out, day in--week out, week in--month out,\nmonth in--and himself the voluntary jailer! Is this the end of\nphilosophy? This the larger, and spiritual life? This your boasted\nempyrean? Is it for this that a man should grow wise, and leave off his\nmost excellent and calumniated folly?\"\n\nAnd here is a third.\n\n\"Cast thy eye in there on Vivia; he, who in the pursuit of the highest\nhealth of virtue and truth, shows but a pallid cheek! Weigh his heart in\nthy hand, oh, thou gold-laced, virtuoso Goethe! and tell me whether it\ndoes not exceed thy standard weight!\"\n\nAnd here is a fourth.\n\n\"Oh God, that man should spoil and rust on the stalk, and be wilted and\nthreshed ere the harvest hath come! And oh God, that men that call\nthemselves men should still insist on a laugh! I hate the world, and\ncould trample all lungs of mankind as grapes, and heel them out of their\nbreath, to think of the woe and the cant,--to think of the Truth and the\nLie! Oh! blessed be the twenty-first day of December, and cursed be the\ntwenty-first day of June!\"\n\nFrom these random slips, it would seem, that Pierre is quite conscious\nof much that is so anomalously hard and bitter in his lot, of much that\nis so black and terrific in his soul. Yet that knowing his fatal\ncondition does not one whit enable him to change or better his\ncondition. Conclusive proof that he has no power over his condition. For\nin tremendous extremities human souls are like drowning men; well enough\nthey know they are in peril; well enough they know the causes of that\nperil;--nevertheless, the sea is the sea, and these drowning men do\ndrown.\n\n\nIV.\n\nFrom eight o'clock in the morning till half-past four in the evening,\nPierre sits there in his room;--eight hours and a half!\n\nFrom throbbing neck-bands, and swinging belly-bands of gay-hearted\nhorses, the sleigh-bells chimingly jingle;--but Pierre sits there in his\nroom; Thanksgiving comes, with its glad thanks, and crisp turkeys;--but\nPierre sits there in his room; soft through the snows, on tinted Indian\nmoccasin, Merry Christmas comes stealing;--but Pierre sits there in his\nroom; it is New-Year's, and like a great flagon, the vast city overbrims\nat all curb-stones, wharves, and piers, with bubbling jubilations;--but\nPierre sits there in his room:--Nor jingling sleigh-bells at throbbing\nneck-band, or swinging belly-band; nor glad thanks, and crisp turkeys of\nThanksgiving; nor tinted Indian moccasin of Merry Christmas softly\nstealing through the snows; nor New-Year's curb-stones, wharves, and\npiers, over-brimming with bubbling jubilations:--Nor jingling\nsleigh-bells, nor glad Thanksgiving, nor Merry Christmas, nor jubilating\nNew Year's:--Nor Bell, Thank, Christ, Year;--none of these are for\nPierre. In the midst of the merriments of the mutations of Time, Pierre\nhath ringed himself in with the grief of Eternity. Pierre is a peak\ninflexible in the heart of Time, as the isle-peak, Piko, stands\nunassaultable in the midst of waves.\n\nHe will not be called to; he will not be stirred. Sometimes the intent\near of Isabel in the next room, overhears the alternate silence, and\nthen the long lonely scratch of his pen. It is, as if she heard the busy\nclaw of some midnight mole in the ground. Sometimes, she hears a low\ncough, and sometimes the scrape of his crook-handled cane.\n\nHere surely is a wonderful stillness of eight hours and a half, repeated\nday after day. In the heart of such silence, surely something is at\nwork. Is it creation, or destruction? Builds Pierre the noble world of\na new book? or does the Pale Haggardness unbuild the lungs and the life\nin him?--Unutterable, that a man should be thus!\n\nWhen in the meridian flush of the day, we recall the black apex of\nnight; then night seems impossible; this sun can never go down. Oh that\nthe memory of the uttermost gloom as an already tasted thing to the\ndregs, should be no security against its return. One may be passibly\nwell one day, but the next, he may sup at black broth with Pluto.\n\nIs there then all this work to one book, which shall be read in a very\nfew hours; and, far more frequently, utterly skipped in one second; and\nwhich, in the end, whatever it be, must undoubtedly go to the worms?\n\nNot so; that which now absorbs the time and the life of Pierre, is not\nthe book, but the primitive elementalizing of the strange stuff, which\nin the act of attempting that book, have upheaved and upgushed in his\nsoul. Two books are being writ; of which the world shall only see one,\nand that the bungled one. The larger book, and the infinitely better, is\nfor Pierre's own private shelf. That it is, whose unfathomable cravings\ndrink his blood; the other only demands his ink. But circumstances have\nso decreed, that the one can not be composed on the paper, but only as\nthe other is writ down in his soul. And the one of the soul is\nelephantinely sluggish, and will not budge at a breath. Thus Pierre is\nfastened on by two leeches;--how then can the life of Pierre last? Lo!\nhe is fitting himself for the highest life, by thinning his blood and\ncollapsing his heart. He is learning how to live, by rehearsing the part\nof death.\n\nWho shall tell all the thoughts and feelings of Pierre in that desolate\nand shivering room, when at last the idea obtruded, that the wiser and\nthe profounder he should grow, the more and the more he lessened the\nchances for bread; that could he now hurl his deep book out of the\nwindow, and fall to on some shallow nothing of a novel, composable in a\nmonth at the longest, then could he reasonably hope for both\nappreciation and cash. But the devouring profundities, now opened up in\nhim, consume all his vigor; would he, he could not now be entertainingly\nand profitably shallow in some pellucid and merry romance. Now he sees,\nthat with every accession of the personal divine to him, some great\nland-slide of the general surrounding divineness slips from him, and\nfalls crashing away. Said I not that the gods, as well as mankind, had\nunhanded themselves from this Pierre? So now in him you behold the baby\ntoddler I spoke of; forced now to stand and toddle alone.\n\nNow and then he turns to the camp-bed, and wetting his towel in the\nbasin, presses it against his brow. Now he leans back in his chair, as\nif to give up; but again bends over and plods.\n\nTwilight draws on, the summons of Isabel is heard from the door; the\npoor, frozen, blue-lipped, soul-shivering traveler for St. Petersburg is\nunpacked; and for a moment stands toddling on the floor. Then his hat,\nand his cane, and out he sallies for fresh air. A most comfortless\nstaggering of a stroll! People gaze at him passing, as at some imprudent\nsick man, willfully burst from his bed. If an acquaintance is met, and\nwould say a pleasant newsmonger's word in his ear, that acquaintance\nturns from him, affronted at his hard aspect of icy discourtesy.\n\"Bad-hearted,\" mutters the man, and goes on.\n\nHe comes back to his chambers, and sits down at the neat table of Delly;\nand Isabel soothingly eyes him, and presses him to eat and be strong.\nBut his is the famishing which loathes all food. He can not eat but by\nforce. He has assassinated the natural day; how then can he eat with an\nappetite? If he lays him down, he can not sleep; he has waked the\ninfinite wakefulness in him; then how can he slumber? Still his book,\nlike a vast lumbering planet, revolves in his aching head. He can not\ncommand the thing out of its orbit; fain would he behead himself, to\ngain one night's repose. At last the heavy hours move on; and sheer\nexhaustion overtakes him, and he lies still--not asleep as children and\nday-laborers sleep--but he lies still from his throbbings, and for that\ninterval holdingly sheaths the beak of the vulture in his hand, and lets\nit not enter his heart.\n\nMorning comes; again the dropt sash, the icy water, the flesh-brush, the\nbreakfast, the hot bricks, the ink, the pen, the\nfrom-eight-o'clock-to-half-past-four, and the whole general inclusive\nhell of the same departed day.\n\nAh! shivering thus day after day in his wrappers and cloaks, is this the\nwarm lad that once sung to the world of the Tropical Summer?\n\n\n\n\nBOOK XXIII.\n\nA LETTER FOR PIERRE. ISABEL. ARRIVAL OF LUCY'S EASEL AND TRUNKS AT THE\nAPOSTLES'.\n\n\nI.\n\nIf a frontier man be seized by wild Indians, and carried far and deep\ninto the wilderness, and there held a captive, with no slightest\nprobability of eventual deliverance; then the wisest thing for that man\nis to exclude from his memory by every possible method, the least images\nof those beloved objects now forever reft from him. For the more\ndelicious they were to him in the now departed possession, so much the\nmore agonizing shall they be in the present recalling. And though a\nstrong man may sometimes succeed in strangling such tormenting memories;\nyet, if in the beginning permitted to encroach upon him unchecked, the\nsame man shall, in the end, become as an idiot. With a continent and an\nocean between him and his wife--thus sundered from her, by whatever\nimperative cause, for a term of long years;--the husband, if\npassionately devoted to her, and by nature broodingly sensitive of soul,\nis wise to forget her till he embrace her again;--is wise never to\nremember her if he hear of her death. And though such complete suicidal\nforgettings prove practically impossible, yet is it the shallow and\nostentatious affections alone which are bustling in the offices of\nobituarian memories. _The love deep as death_--what mean those five\nwords, but that such love can not live, and be continually remembering\nthat the loved one is no more? If it be thus then in cases where entire\nunremorsefulness as regards the beloved absent objects is presumed, how\nmuch more intolerable, when the knowledge of their hopeless wretchedness\noccurs, attended by the visitations of before latent upbraidings in the\nrememberer as having been any way--even unwillingly--the producers of\ntheir sufferings. There seems no other sane recourse for some moody\norganizations on whom such things, under such circumstances intrude, but\nright and left to flee them, whatever betide.\n\nIf little or nothing hitherto has been said of Lucy Tartan in reference\nto the condition of Pierre after his departure from the Meadows, it has\nonly been because her image did not willingly occupy his soul. He had\nstriven his utmost to banish it thence; and only once--on receiving the\ntidings of Glen's renewed attentions--did he remit the intensity of\nthose strivings, or rather feel them, as impotent in him in that hour of\nhis manifold and overwhelming prostration.\n\nNot that the pale form of Lucy, swooning on her snow-white bed; not that\nthe inexpressible anguish of the shriek--\"My heart! my heart!\" would not\nnow at times force themselves upon him, and cause his whole being to\nthrill with a nameless horror and terror. But the very thrillingness of\nthe phantom made him to shun it, with all remaining might of his spirit.\n\nNor were there wanting still other, and far more wonderful, though but\ndimly conscious influences in the breast of Pierre, to meet as\nrepellants the imploring form. Not to speak of his being devoured by the\nall-exacting theme of his book, there were sinister preoccupations in\nhim of a still subtler and more fearful sort, of which some inklings\nhave already been given.\n\nIt was while seated solitary in his room one morning; his flagging\nfaculties seeking a momentary respite; his head sideways turned toward\nthe naked floor, following the seams in it, which, as wires, led\nstraight from where he sat to the connecting door, and disappeared\nbeneath it into the chamber of Isabel; that he started at a tap at that\nvery door, followed by the wonted, low, sweet voice,--\n\n\"Pierre! a letter for thee--dost thou hear? a letter,--may I come in?\"\n\nAt once he felt a dart of surprise and apprehension; for he was\nprecisely in that general condition with respect to the outer world,\nthat he could not reasonably look for any tidings but disastrous, or at\nleast, unwelcome ones. He assented; and Isabel entered, holding out the\nbillet in her hand.\n\n\"'Tis from some lady, Pierre; who can it be?--not thy mother though, of\nthat I am certain;--the expression of her face, as seen by me, not at\nall answering to the expression of this handwriting here.\"\n\n\"My mother? from my mother?\" muttered Pierre, in wild vacancy--\"no! no!\nit can scarce be from her.--Oh, she writes no more, even in her own\nprivate tablets now! Death hath stolen the last leaf, and rubbed all\nout, to scribble his own ineffaceable _hic jacet_ there!\"\n\n\"Pierre!\" cried Isabel, in affright.\n\n\"Give it me!\" he shouted, vehemently, extending his hand. \"Forgive me,\nsweet, sweet Isabel, I have wandered in my mind; this book makes me mad.\nThere; I have it now\"--in a tone of indifference--\"now, leave me again.\nIt is from some pretty aunt, or cousin, I suppose,\" carelessly balancing\nthe letter in his hand.\n\nIsabel quitted the room; the moment the door closed upon her, Pierre\neagerly split open the letter, and read:--\n\n\nII.\n\n\"This morning I vowed it, my own dearest, dearest Pierre I feel stronger\nto-day; for to-day I have still more thought of thine own superhuman,\nangelical strength; which so, has a very little been transferred to me.\nOh, Pierre, Pierre, with what words shall I write thee now;--now, when\nstill knowing nothing, yet something of thy secret I, as a seer,\nsuspect. Grief,--deep, unspeakable grief, hath made me this seer. I\ncould murder myself, Pierre, when I think of my previous blindness; but\nthat only came from my swoon. It was horrible and most murdersome; but\nnow I see thou wert right in being so instantaneous with me, and in\nnever afterward writing to me, Pierre; yes, now I see it, and adore thee\nthe more.\n\n\"Ah! thou too noble and angelical Pierre, now I feel that a being like\nthee, can possibly have no love as other men love; but thou lovest as\nangels do; not for thyself, but wholly for others. But still are we one,\nPierre; thou art sacrificing thyself, and I hasten to re-tie myself to\nthee, that so I may catch thy fire, and all the ardent multitudinous\narms of our common flames may embrace. I will ask of thee nothing,\nPierre; thou shalt tell me no secret. Very right wert thou, Pierre,\nwhen, in that ride to the hills, thou wouldst not swear the fond,\nfoolish oath I demanded. Very right, very right; now I see it.\n\n\"If then I solemnly vow, never to seek from thee any slightest thing\nwhich thou wouldst not willingly have me know; if ever I, in all outward\nactions, shall recognize, just as thou dost, the peculiar position of\nthat mysterious, and ever-sacred being;--then, may I not come and live\nwith thee? I will be no encumbrance to thee. I know just where thou art,\nand how thou art living; and only just there, Pierre, and only just so,\nis any further life endurable, or possible for me. She will never\nknow--for thus far I am sure thou thyself hast never disclosed it to\nher what I once was to thee. Let it seem, as though I were some\nnun-like cousin immovably vowed to dwell with thee in thy strange exile.\nShow not to me,--never show more any visible conscious token of love. I\nwill never to thee. Our mortal lives, oh, my heavenly Pierre, shall\nhenceforth be one mute wooing of each other; with no declaration; no\nbridal; till we meet in the pure realms of God's final blessedness for\nus;--till we meet where the ever-interrupting and ever-marring world can\nnot and shall not come; where all thy hidden, glorious unselfishness\nshall be gloriously revealed in the full splendor of that heavenly\nlight; where, no more forced to these cruelest disguises, she, _she_ too\nshall assume her own glorious place, nor take it hard, but rather feel\nthe more blessed, when, there, thy sweet heart, shall be openly and\nunreservedly mine. Pierre, Pierre, my Pierre!--only this thought, this\nhope, this sublime faith now supports me. Well was it, that the swoon,\nin which thou didst leave me, that long eternity ago--well was it, dear\nPierre, that though I came out of it to stare and grope, yet it was only\nto stare and grope, and then I swooned again, and then groped again, and\nthen again swooned. But all this was vacancy; little I clutched; nothing\nI knew; 'twas less than a dream, my Pierre, I had no conscious thought\nof thee, love; but felt an utter blank, a vacancy;--for wert thou not\nthen utterly gone from me? and what could there then be left of poor\nLucy?--But now, this long, long swoon is past; I come out again into\nlife and light; but how could I come out, how could I any way _be_, my\nPierre, if not in thee? So the moment I came out of the long, long\nswoon, straightway came to me the immortal faith in thee, which though\nit could offer no one slightest possible argument of mere sense in thy\nbehalf, yet was it only the more mysteriously imperative for that, my\nPierre. Know then, dearest Pierre, that with every most glaring earthly\nreason to disbelieve in thy love; I do yet wholly give myself up to the\nunshakable belief in it. For I feel, that always is love love, and can\nnot know change, Pierre; I feel that heaven hath called me to a\nwonderful office toward thee. By throwing me into that long, long\nswoon,--during which, Martha tells me, I hardly ate altogether, three\nordinary meals,--by that, heaven, I feel now, was preparing me for the\nsuperhuman office I speak of; was wholly estranging me from this earth,\neven while I yet lingered in it; was fitting me for a celestial mission\nin terrestrial elements. Oh, give to me of thine own dear strength! I am\nbut a poor weak girl, dear Pierre; one that didst once love thee but too\nfondly, and with earthly frailty. But now I shall be wafted far upward\nfrom that; shall soar up to thee, where thou sittest in thine own calm,\nsublime heaven of heroism.\n\n\"Oh seek not to dissuade me, Pierre. Wouldst thou slay me, and slay me a\nmillion times more? and never have done with murdering me? I must come!\nI must come! God himself can not stay me, for it is He that commands\nme.--I know all that will follow my flight to thee;--my amazed mother,\nmy enraged brothers, the whole taunting and despising world.--But thou\nart my mother and my brothers, and all the world, and all heaven, and\nall the universe to me--thou _art_ my Pierre. One only being does this\nsoul in me serve--and that is thee, Pierre.--So I am coming to thee,\nPierre, and quickly;--to-morrow it shall be, and never more will I quit\nthee, Pierre. Speak thou immediately to her about me; thou shalt know\nbest what to say. Is there not some connection between our families,\nPierre? I have heard my mother sometimes trace such a thing out,--some\nindirect cousinship. If thou approvest then, thou shalt say to her, I am\nthy cousin, Pierre;--thy resolved and immovable nun-like cousin; vowed\nto dwell with thee forever; to serve thee and her, to guard thee and her\nwithout end. Prepare some little corner for me somewhere; but let it be\nvery near. Ere I come, I shall send a few little things,--the tools I\nshall work by, Pierre, and so contribute to the welfare of all. Look for\nme then. I am coming! I am coming, my Pierre; for a deep, deep voice\nassures me, that all noble as thou art, Pierre, some terrible jeopardy\ninvolves thee, which my continual presence only can drive away. I am\ncoming! I am coming!\"\n\nLUCY.\n\n\nIII.\n\nWhen surrounded by the base and mercenary crew, man, too long wonted to\neye his race with a suspicious disdain, suddenly is brushed by some\nangelical plume of humanity, and the human accents of superhuman love,\nand the human eyes of superhuman beauty and glory, suddenly burst on his\nbeing; then how wonderful and fearful the shock! It is as if the\nsky-cope were rent, and from the black valley of Jehoshaphat, he caught\nupper glimpses of the seraphim in the visible act of adoring.\n\nHe held the artless, angelical letter in his unrealizing hand; he\nstarted, and gazed round his room, and out at the window, commanding the\nbare, desolate, all-forbidding quadrangle, and then asked himself\nwhether this was the place that an angel should choose for its visit to\nearth. Then he felt a vast, out-swelling triumphantness, that the girl\nwhose rare merits his intuitive soul had once so clearly and\npassionately discerned, should indeed, in this most tremendous of all\ntrials, have acquitted herself with such infinite majesty. Then again,\nhe sunk utterly down from her, as in a bottomless gulf, and ran\nshuddering through hideous galleries of despair, in pursuit of some\nvague, white shape, and lo! two unfathomable dark eyes met his, and\nIsabel stood mutely and mournfully, yet all-ravishingly before him.\n\nHe started up from his plank; cast off his manifold wrappings, and\ncrossed the floor to remove himself from the spot, where such sweet,\nsuch sublime, such terrific revelations had been made him.\n\nThen a timid little rap was heard at the door.\n\n\"Pierre, Pierre; now that thou art risen, may I not come in--just for a\nmoment, Pierre.\"\n\n\"Come in, Isabel.\"\n\nShe was approaching him in her wonted most strange and sweetly mournful\nmanner, when he retreated a step from her, and held out his arm, not\nseemingly to invite, but rather as if to warn.\n\nShe looked fixedly in his face, and stood rooted.\n\n\"Isabel, another is coming to me. Thou dost not speak, Isabel. She is\ncoming to dwell with us so long as we live, Isabel. Wilt thou not\nspeak?\"\n\nThe girl still stood rooted; the eyes, which she had first fixed on him,\nstill remained wide-openly riveted.\n\n\"Wilt thou not speak, Isabel?\" said Pierre, terrified at her frozen,\nimmovable aspect, yet too terrified to manifest his own terror to her;\nand still coming slowly near her. She slightly raised one arm, as if to\ngrasp some support; then turned her head slowly sideways toward the door\nby which she had entered; then her dry lips slowly parted--\"My bed; lay\nme; lay me!\"\n\nThe verbal effort broke her stiffening enchantment of frost; her thawed\nform sloped sidelong into the air; but Pierre caught her, and bore her\ninto her own chamber, and laid her there on the bed.\n\n\"Fan me; fan me!\"\n\nHe fanned the fainting flame of her life; by-and-by she turned slowly\ntoward him.\n\n\"Oh! that feminine word from thy mouth, dear Pierre:--that _she_, that\n_she_!\"\n\nPierre sat silent, fanning her.\n\n\"Oh, I want none in the world but thee, my brother--but thee, but thee!\nand, oh God! am _I_ not enough for thee? Bare earth with my brother were\nall heaven for me; but all my life, all my full soul, contents not my\nbrother.\"\n\nPierre spoke not; he but listened; a terrible, burning curiosity was in\nhim, that made him as heartless. But still all that she had said thus\nfar was ambiguous.\n\n\"Had I known--had I but known it before! Oh bitterly cruel to reveal it\nnow. That _she_! That _she_!\"\n\nShe raised herself suddenly, and almost fiercely confronted him.\n\n\"Either thou hast told thy secret, or she is not worthy the commonest\nlove of man! Speak Pierre,--which?\"\n\n\"The secret is still a secret, Isabel.\"\n\n\"Then is she worthless, Pierre, whoever she be--foolishly, madly\nfond!--Doth not the world know me for thy wife?--She shall not come!\n'Twere a foul blot on thee and me. She shall not come! One look from me\nshall murder her, Pierre!\"\n\n\"This is madness, Isabel. Look: now reason with me. Did I not before\nopening the letter, say to thee, that doubtless it was from some pretty\nyoung aunt or cousin?\"\n\n\"Speak quick!--a cousin?\"\n\n\"A cousin, Isabel.\"\n\n\"Yet, yet, that is not wholly out of the degree, I have heard. Tell me\nmore, and quicker! more! more!\"\n\n\"A very strange cousin, Isabel; almost a nun in her notions. Hearing of\nour mysterious exile, she, without knowing the cause, hath yet as\nmysteriously vowed herself ours--not so much mine, Isabel, as ours,\n_ours_--to serve _us_; and by some sweet heavenly fancying, to guide us\nand guard us here.\"\n\n\"Then, possibly, it may be all very well, Pierre, my brother--my\n_brother_--I can say that now?\"\n\n\"Any,--all words are thine, Isabel; words and worlds with all their\ncontainings, shall be slaves to thee, Isabel.\"\n\nShe looked eagerly and inquiringly at him; then dropped her eyes, and\ntouched his hand; then gazed again. \"Speak so more to me, Pierre! Thou\nart my brother; art thou not my brother?--But tell me now more of--her;\nit is all newness, and utter strangeness to me, Pierre.\"\n\n\"I have said, my sweetest sister, that she has this wild, nun-like\nnotion in her. She is willful in it; in this letter she vows she must\nand will come, and nothing on earth shall stay her. Do not have any\nsisterly jealousy, then, my sister. Thou wilt find her a most gentle,\nunobtrusive, ministering girl, Isabel. She will never name the\nnot-to-be-named things to thee; nor hint of them; because she knows them\nnot. Still, without knowing the secret, she yet hath the vague,\nunspecializing sensation of the secret--the mystical presentiment,\nsomehow, of the secret. And her divineness hath drowned all womanly\ncuriosity in her; so that she desires not, in any way, to verify the\npresentiment; content with the vague presentiment only; for in that, she\nthinks, the heavenly summons to come to us, lies;--even there, in that,\nIsabel. Dost thou now comprehend me?\"\n\n\"I comprehend nothing, Pierre; there is nothing these eyes have ever\nlooked upon, Pierre, that this soul comprehended. Ever, as now, do I go\nall a-grope amid the wide mysteriousness of things. Yes, she shall come;\nit is only one mystery the more. Doth she talk in her sleep, Pierre?\nWould it be well, if I slept with her, my brother?\"\n\n\"On thy account; wishful for thy sake; to leave thee incommoded;\nand--and--not knowing precisely how things really are;--she probably\nanticipates and desires otherwise, my sister.\"\n\nShe gazed steadfastly at his outwardly firm, but not interiorly\nunfaltering aspect; and then dropped her glance in silence.\n\n\"Yes, she shall come, my brother; she shall come. But it weaves its\nthread into the general riddle, my brother.--Hath she that which they\ncall the memory, Pierre; the memory? Hath she that?\"\n\n\"We all have the memory, my sister.\"\n\n\"Not all! not all!--poor Bell hath but very little. Pierre! I have seen\nher in some dream. She is fair-haired--blue eyes--she is not quite so\ntall as I, yet a very little slighter.\"\n\nPierre started. \"Thou hast seen Lucy Tartan, at Saddle Meadows?\"\n\n\"Is Lucy Tartan the name?--Perhaps, perhaps;--but also, in the dream,\nPierre; she came, with her blue eyes turned beseechingly on me; she\nseemed as if persuading me from thee;--methought she was then more than\nthy cousin;--methought she was that good angel, which some say, hovers\nover every human soul; and methought--oh, methought that I was thy\nother,--thy other angel, Pierre. Look: see these eyes,--this hair--nay,\nthis cheek;--all dark, dark, dark,--and she--the blue-eyed--the\nfair-haired--oh, once the red-cheeked!\"\n\nShe tossed her ebon tresses over her; she fixed her ebon eyes on him.\n\n\"Say, Pierre; doth not a funerealness invest me? Was ever hearse so\nplumed?--Oh, God! that I had been born with blue eyes, and fair hair!\nThose make the livery of heaven! Heard ye ever yet of a good angel with\ndark eyes, Pierre?--no, no, no--all blue, blue, blue--heaven's own\nblue--the clear, vivid, unspeakable blue, which we see in June skies,\nwhen all clouds are swept by.--But the good angel shall come to thee,\nPierre. Then both will be close by thee, my brother; and thou mayest\nperhaps elect,--elect!--She shall come; she shall come.--When is it to\nbe, dear Pierre?\"\n\n\"To-morrow, Isabel. So it is here written.\"\n\nShe fixed her eye on the crumpled billet in his hand. \"It were vile to\nask, but not wrong to suppose the asking.--Pierre,--no, I need not say\nit,--wouldst thou?\"\n\n\"No; I would not let thee read it, my sister; I would not; because I\nhave no right to--no right--no right;--that is it; no: I have no right.\nI will burn it this instant, Isabel.\"\n\nHe stepped from her into the adjoining room; threw the billet into the\nstove, and watching its last ashes, returned to Isabel.\n\nShe looked with endless intimations upon him.\n\n\"It is burnt, but not consumed; it is gone, but not lost. Through stove,\npipe, and flue, it hath mounted in flame, and gone as a scroll to\nheaven! It shall appear again, my brother.--Woe is me--woe, woe!--woe is\nme, oh, woe! Do not speak to me, Pierre; leave me now. She shall come.\nThe Bad angel shall tend the Good; she shall dwell with us, Pierre.\nMistrust me not; her considerateness to me, shall be outdone by mine to\nher.--Let me be alone now, my brother.\"\n\n\nIV.\n\nThough by the unexpected petition to enter his privacy--a petition he\ncould scarce ever deny to Isabel, since she so religiously abstained\nfrom preferring it, unless for some very reasonable cause, Pierre, in\nthe midst of those conflicting, secondary emotions, immediately\nfollowing the first wonderful effect of Lucy's strange letter, had been\nforced to put on, toward Isabel, some air of assurance and understanding\nconcerning its contents; yet at bottom, he was still a prey to all\nmanner of devouring mysteries.\n\nSoon, now, as he left the chamber of Isabel, these mysteriousnesses\nre-mastered him completely; and as he mechanically sat down in the\ndining-room chair, gently offered him by Delly--for the silent girl saw\nthat some strangeness that sought stillness was in him;--Pierre's mind\nwas revolving how it was possible, or any way conceivable, that Lucy\nshould have been inspired with such seemingly wonderful presentiments of\nsomething assumed, or disguising, or non-substantial, somewhere and\nsomehow, in his present most singular apparent position in the eye of\nworld. The wild words of Isabel yet rang in his ears. It were an outrage\nupon all womanhood to imagine that Lucy, however yet devoted to him in\nher hidden heart, should be willing to come to him, so long as she\nsupposed, with the rest of the world, that Pierre was an ordinarily\nmarried man. But how--what possible reason--what possible intimation\ncould she have had to suspect the contrary, or to suspect any thing\nunsound? For neither at this present time, nor at any subsequent period,\ndid Pierre, or could Pierre, possibly imagine that in her marvelous\npresentiments of Love she had any definite conceit of the precise nature\nof the secret which so unrevealingly and enchantedly wrapt him. But a\npeculiar thought passingly recurred to him here.\n\nWithin his social recollections there was a very remarkable case of a\nyouth, who, while all but affianced to a beautiful girl--one returning\nhis own throbbings with incipient passion--became somehow casually and\nmomentarily betrayed into an imprudent manifested tenderness toward a\nsecond lady; or else, that second lady's deeply-concerned friends caused\nit to be made known to the poor youth, that such committal tenderness\ntoward her he had displayed, nor had it failed to exert its natural\neffect upon her; certain it is, this second lady drooped and drooped,\nand came nigh to dying, all the while raving of the cruel infidelity of\nher supposed lover; so that those agonizing appeals, from so really\nlovely a girl, that seemed dying of grief for him, at last so moved the\nyouth, that--morbidly disregardful of the fact, that inasmuch as two\nladies claimed him, the prior lady had the best title to his hand--his\nconscience insanely upbraided him concerning the second lady; he thought\nthat eternal woe would surely overtake him both here and hereafter if he\ndid not renounce his first love--terrible as the effort would be both to\nhim and her--and wed with the second lady; which he accordingly did;\nwhile, through his whole subsequent life, delicacy and honor toward his\nthus wedded wife, forbade that by explaining to his first love how it\nwas with him in this matter, he should tranquilize her heart; and,\ntherefore, in her complete ignorance, she believed that he was willfully\nand heartlessly false to her; and so came to a lunatic's death on his\naccount.\n\nThis strange story of real life, Pierre knew to be also familiar to\nLucy; for they had several times conversed upon it; and the first love\nof the demented youth had been a school-mate of Lucy's, and Lucy had\ncounted upon standing up with her as bridesmaid. Now, the passing idea\nwas self-suggested to Pierre, whether into Lucy's mind some such conceit\nas this, concerning himself and Isabel, might not possibly have stolen.\nBut then again such a supposition proved wholly untenable in the end;\nfor it did by no means suffice for a satisfactory solution of the\nabsolute motive of the extraordinary proposed step of Lucy; nor indeed\nby any ordinary law of propriety, did it at all seem to justify that\nstep. Therefore, he know not what to think; hardly what to dream.\nWonders, nay, downright miracles and no less were sung about Love; but\nhere was the absolute miracle itself--the out-acted miracle. For\ninfallibly certain he inwardly felt, that whatever her strange conceit;\nwhatever her enigmatical delusion; whatever her most secret and\ninexplicable motive; still Lucy in her own virgin heart remained\ntransparently immaculate, without shadow of flaw or vein. Nevertheless,\nwhat inconceivable conduct this was in her, which she in her letter so\npassionately proposed! Altogether, it amazed him; it confounded him.\n\nNow, that vague, fearful feeling stole into him, that, rail as all\natheists will, there is a mysterious, inscrutable divineness in the\nworld--a God--a Being positively present everywhere;--nay, He is now in\nthis room; the air did part when I here sat down. I displaced the Spirit\nthen--condensed it a little off from this spot. He looked\napprehensively around him; he felt overjoyed at the sight of the\nhumanness of Delly.\n\nWhile he was thus plunged into this mysteriousness, a knock was heard at\nthe door.\n\nDelly hesitatingly rose--\"Shall I let any one in, sir?--I think it is\nMr. Millthorpe's knock.\"\n\n\"Go and see--go and see\"--said Pierre, vacantly.\n\nThe moment the door was opened, Millthorpe--for it was he--catching a\nglimpse of Pierre's seated form, brushed past Delly, and loudly entered\nthe room.\n\n\"Ha, ha! well, my boy, how comes on the Inferno? That is it you are\nwriting; one is apt to look black while writing Infernoes; you always\nloved Dante. My lad! I have finished ten metaphysical treatises; argued\nfive cases before the court; attended all our society's meetings;\naccompanied our great Professor, Monsieur Volvoon, the lecturer, through\nhis circuit in the philosophical saloons, sharing all the honors of his\nillustrious triumph; and by the way, let me tell you, Volvoon secretly\ngives me even more credit than is my due; for 'pon my soul, I did not\nhelp write more than one half, at most, of his Lectures;\nedited--anonymously, though--a learned, scientific work on 'The Precise\nCause of the Modifications in the Undulatory Motion in Waves,' a\nposthumous work of a poor fellow--fine lad he was, too--a friend of\nmine. Yes, here I have been doing all this, while you still are\nhammering away at that one poor plaguy Inferno! Oh, there's a secret in\ndispatching these things; patience! patience! you will yet learn the\nsecret. Time! time! I can't teach it to you, my boy, but Time can: I\nwish I could, but I can't.\"\n\nThere was another knock at the door.\n\n\"Oh!\" cried Millthorpe, suddenly turning round to it, \"I forgot, my boy.\nI came to tell you that there is a porter, with some queer things,\ninquiring for you. I happened to meet him down stairs in the corridors,\nand I told him to follow me up--I would show him the road; here he is;\nlet him in, let him in, good Delly, my girl.\"\n\nThus far, the rattlings of Millthorpe, if producing any effect at all,\nhad but stunned the averted Pierre. But now he started to his feet. A\nman with his hat on, stood in the door, holding an easel before him.\n\n\"Is this Mr. Glendinning's room, gentlemen?\"\n\n\"Oh, come in, come in,\" cried Millthorpe, \"all right.\"\n\n\"Oh! is that _you_, sir? well, well, then;\" and the man set down the\neasel.\n\n\"Well, my boy,\" exclaimed Millthorpe to Pierre; \"you are in the Inferno\ndream yet. Look; that's what people call an _easel_, my boy. An _easel_,\nan _easel_--not a _weasel_; you look at it as though you thought it a\nweasel. Come; wake up, wake up! You ordered it, I suppose, and here it\nis. Going to paint and illustrate the Inferno, as you go along, I\nsuppose. Well, my friends tell me it is a great pity my own things aint\nillustrated. But I can't afford it. There now is that Hymn to the Niger,\nwhich I threw into a pigeon-hole, a year or two ago--that would be fine\nfor illustrations.\"\n\n\"Is it for Mr. Glendinning you inquire?\" said Pierre now, in a slow, icy\ntone, to the porter.\n\n\"Mr. Glendinning, sir; all right, aint it?\"\n\n\"Perfectly,\" said Pierre mechanically, and casting another strange,\nrapt, bewildered glance at the easel. \"But something seems strangely\nwanting here. Ay, now I see, I see it:--Villain!--the vines! Thou hast\ntorn the green heart-strings! Thou hast but left the cold skeleton of\nthe sweet arbor wherein she once nestled! Thou besotted, heartless hind\nand fiend, dost thou so much as dream in thy shriveled liver of the\neternal mischief thou hast done? Restore thou the green vines! untrample\nthem, thou accursed!--Oh my God, my God, trampled vines pounded and\ncrushed in all fibers, how can they live over again, even though they be\nreplanted! Curse thee, thou!--Nay, nay,\" he added moodily--\"I was but\nwandering to myself.\" Then rapidly and mockingly--\"Pardon,\npardon!--porter; I most humbly crave thy most haughty pardon.\" Then\nimperiously--\"Come, stir thyself, man; thou hast more below: bring all\nup.\"\n\nAs the astounded porter turned, he whispered to Millthorpe--\"Is he\nsafe?--shall I bring 'em?\"\n\n\"Oh certainly,\" smiled Millthorpe: \"I'll look out for him; he's never\nreally dangerous when I'm present; there, go!\"\n\nTwo trunks now followed, with \"L. T.\" blurredly marked upon the ends.\n\n\"Is that all, my man?\" said Pierre, as the trunks were being put down\nbefore him; \"well, how much?\"--that moment his eyes first caught the\nblurred letters.\n\n\"Prepaid, sir; but no objection to more.\"\n\nPierre stood mute and unmindful, still fixedly eying the blurred\nletters; his body contorted, and one side drooping, as though that\nmoment half-way down-stricken with a paralysis, and yet unconscious of\nthe stroke.\n\nHis two companions, momentarily stood motionless in those respective\nattitudes, in which they had first caught sight of the remarkable change\nthat had come over him. But, as if ashamed of having been thus affected,\nMillthorpe summoning a loud, merry voice, advanced toward Pierre, and,\ntapping his shoulder, cried, \"Wake up, wake up, my boy!--He says he is\nprepaid, but no objection to more.\"\n\n\"Prepaid;--what's that? Go, go, and jabber to apes!\"\n\n\"A curious young gentleman, is he not?\" said Millthorpe lightly to the\nporter;--\"Look you, my boy, I'll repeat:--He says he's prepaid, but no\nobjection to more.\"\n\n\"Ah?--take that then,\" said Pierre, vacantly putting something into the\nporter's hand.\n\n\"And what shall I do with this, sir?\" said the porter, staring.\n\n\"Drink a health; but not mine; that were mockery!\"\n\n\"With a key, sir? This is a key you gave me.\"\n\n\"Ah!--well, you at least shall not have the thing that unlocks me. Give\nme the key, and take this.\"\n\n\"Ay, ay!--here's the chink! Thank'ee sir, thank'ee. This'll drink. I\naint called a porter for nothing; Stout's the word; 2151 is my number;\nany jobs, call on me.\"\n\n\"Do you ever cart a coffin, my man?\" said Pierre.\n\n\"'Pon my soul!\" cried Millthorpe, gayly laughing, \"if you aint writing\nan Inferno, then--but never mind. Porter! this gentleman is under\nmedical treatment at present. You had better--ab'--you\nunderstand--'squatulate, porter! There, my boy, he is gone; I understand\nhow to manage these fellows; there's a trick in it, my boy--an\noff-handed sort of what d'ye call it?--you understand--the trick! the\ntrick!--the whole world's a trick. Know the trick of it, all's right;\ndon't know, all's wrong. Ha! ha!\"\n\n\"The porter is gone then?\" said Pierre, calmly. \"Well, Mr. Millthorpe,\nyou will have the goodness to follow him.\"\n\n\"Rare joke! admirable!--Good morning, sir. Ha, ha!\"\n\nAnd with his unruffleable hilariousness, Millthorpe quitted the room.\n\nBut hardly had the door closed upon him, nor had he yet removed his hand\nfrom its outer knob, when suddenly it swung half open again, and\nthrusting his fair curly head within, Millthorpe cried: \"By the way, my\nboy, I have a word for you. You know that greasy fellow who has been\ndunning you so of late. Well, be at rest there; he's paid. I was\nsuddenly made flush yesterday:--regular flood-tide. You can return it\nany day, you know--no hurry; that's all.--But, by the way,--as you look\nas though you were going to have company here--just send for me in case\nyou want to use me--any bedstead to put up, or heavy things to be lifted\nabout. Don't you and the women do it, now, mind! That's all again.\nAddios, my boy. Take care of yourself!\"\n\n\"Stay!\" cried Pierre, reaching forth one hand, but moving neither\nfoot--\"Stay!\"--in the midst of all his prior emotions struck by these\nsingular traits in Millthorpe. But the door was abruptly closed; and\nsinging Fa, la, la: Millthorpe in his seedy coat went tripping down the\ncorridor.\n\n\"Plus heart, minus head,\" muttered Pierre, his eyes fixed on the door.\n\"Now, by heaven! the god that made Millthorpe was both a better and a\ngreater than the god that made Napoleon or Byron.--Plus head, minus\nheart--Pah! the brains grow maggoty without a heart; but the heart's the\npreserving salt itself, and can keep sweet without the head.--Delly!\"\n\n\"Sir?\"\n\n\"My cousin Miss Tartan is coming here to live with us, Delly. That\neasel,--those trunks are hers.\"\n\n\"Good heavens!--coming here?--your cousin?--Miss Tartan?\"\n\n\"Yes, I thought you must have heard of her and me;--but it was broken\noff; Delly.\"\n\n\"Sir? Sir?\"\n\n\"I have no explanation, Delly; and from you, I must have no amazement.\nMy cousin,--mind, my _cousin_, Miss Tartan, is coming to live with us.\nThe next room to this, on the other side there, is unoccupied. That room\nshall be hers. You must wait upon her, too, Delly.\"\n\n\"Certainly sir, certainly; I will do any thing;\" said Delly trembling;\n\"but,--but--does Mrs. Glendin-din--does my mistress know this?\"\n\n\"My wife knows all\"--said Pierre sternly. \"I will go down and get the\nkey of the room; and you must sweep it out.\"\n\n\"What is to be put into it, sir?\" said Delly. \"Miss Tartan--why, she is\nused to all sorts of fine things,--rich\ncarpets--wardrobes--mirrors--curtains;--why, why, why!\"\n\n\"Look,\" said Pierre, touching an old rug with his foot;--\"here is a bit\nof carpet; drag that into her room; here is a chair, put that in; and\nfor a bed,--ay, ay,\" he muttered to himself; \"I have made it for her,\nand she ignorantly lies on it now!--as made--so lie. Oh God!\"\n\n\"Hark! my mistress is calling\"--cried Delly, moving toward the opposite\nroom.\n\n\"Stay!\"--cried Pierre, grasping her shoulder; \"if both called at one\ntime from these opposite chambers, and both were swooning, which door\nwould you first fly to?\"\n\nThe girl gazed at him uncomprehendingly and affrighted a moment; and\nthen said,--\"This one, sir\"--out of mere confusion perhaps, putting her\nhand on Isabel's latch.\n\n\"It is well. Now go.\"\n\nHe stood in an intent unchanged attitude till Delly returned.\n\n\"How is my wife, now?\"\n\nAgain startled by the peculiar emphasis placed on the magical word\n_wife_, Delly, who had long before this, been occasionally struck with\nthe infrequency of his using that term; she looked at him perplexedly,\nand said half-unconsciously--\n\n\"Your wife, sir?\"\n\n\"Ay, is she not?\"\n\n\"God grant that she be--Oh, 'tis most cruel to ask that of poor, poor\nDelly, sir!\"\n\n\"Tut for thy tears! Never deny it again then!--I swear to heaven, she\nis!\"\n\nWith these wild words, Pierre seized his hat, and departed the room,\nmuttering something about bringing the key of the additional chamber.\n\nAs the door closed on him, Delly dropped on her knees. She lifted her\nhead toward the ceiling, but dropped it again, as if tyrannically awed\ndownward, and bent it low over, till her whole form tremulously cringed\nto the floor.\n\n\"God that made me, and that wast not so hard to me as wicked Delly\ndeserved,--God that made me, I pray to thee! ward it off from me, if it\nbe coming to me. Be not deaf to me; these stony walls--Thou canst hear\nthrough them. Pity! pity!--mercy, my God!--If they are not married; if\nI, penitentially seeking to be pure, am now but the servant to a greater\nsin, than I myself committed: then, pity! pity! pity! pity! pity! Oh God\nthat made me,--See me, see me here--what can Delly do? If I go hence,\nnone will take me in but villains. If I stay, then--for stay I must--and\nthey be not married,--then pity, pity, pity, pity, pity!\"\n\n\n\n\nBOOK XXIV.\n\nLUCY AT THE APOSTLES.\n\n\nI.\n\nNext morning, the recently appropriated room adjoining on the other side\nof the dining-room, presented a different aspect from that which met the\neye of Delly upon first unlocking it with Pierre on the previous\nevening. Two squares of faded carpeting of different patterns, covered\nthe middle of the floor, leaving, toward the surbase, a wide, blank\nmargin around them. A small glass hung in the pier; beneath that, a\nlittle stand, with a foot or two of carpet before it. In one corner was\na cot, neatly equipped with bedding. At the outer side of the cot,\nanother strip of carpeting was placed. Lucy's delicate feet should not\nshiver on the naked floor.\n\nPierre, Isabel, and Delly were standing in the room; Isabel's eyes were\nfixed on the cot.\n\n\"I think it will be pretty cosy now,\" said Delly, palely glancing all\nround, and then adjusting the pillow anew.\n\n\"There is no warmth, though,\" said Isabel. \"Pierre, there is no stove in\nthe room. She will be very cold. The pipe--can we not send it this way?\"\nAnd she looked more intently at him, than the question seemed to\nwarrant.\n\n\"Let the pipe stay where it is, Isabel,\" said Pierre, answering her own\npointed gaze. \"The dining-room door can stand open. She never liked\nsleeping in a heated room. Let all be; it is well. Eh! but there is a\ngrate here, I see. I will buy coals. Yes, yes--that can be easily done;\na little fire of a morning--the expense will be nothing. Stay, we will\nhave a little fire here now for a welcome. She shall always have fire.\"\n\n\"Better change the pipe, Pierre,\" said Isabel, \"that will be permanent,\nand save the coals.\"\n\n\"It shall not be done, Isabel. Doth not that pipe and that warmth go\ninto thy room? Shall I rob my wife, good Delly, even to benefit my most\ndevoted and true-hearted cousin?\"\n\n\"Oh! I should say not, sir; not at all,\" said Delly hysterically.\n\nA triumphant fire flashed in Isabel's eye; her full bosom arched out;\nbut she was silent.\n\n\"She may be here, now, at any moment, Isabel,\" said Pierre; \"come, we\nwill meet her in the dining-room; that is our reception-place, thou\nknowest.\"\n\nSo the three went into the dining-room.\n\n\nII.\n\nThey had not been there long, when Pierre, who had been pacing up and\ndown, suddenly paused, as if struck by some laggard thought, which had\njust occurred to him at the eleventh hour. First he looked toward Delly,\nas if about to bid her quit the apartment, while he should say something\nprivate to Isabel; but as if, on a second thought, holding the contrary\nof this procedure most advisable, he, without preface, at once addressed\nIsabel, in his ordinary conversational tone, so that Delly could not but\nplainly hear him, whether she would or no.\n\n\"My dear Isabel, though, as I said to thee before, my cousin, Miss\nTartan, that strange, and willful, nun-like girl, is at all hazards,\nmystically resolved to come and live with us, yet it must be quite\nimpossible that her friends can approve in her such a singular step; a\nstep even more singular, Isabel, than thou, in thy unsophisticatedness,\ncan'st at all imagine. I shall be immensely deceived if they do not, to\ntheir very utmost, strive against it. Now what I am going to add may be\nquite unnecessary, but I can not avoid speaking it, for all that.\"\n\nIsabel with empty hands sat silent, but intently and expectantly eying\nhim; while behind her chair, Delly was bending her face low over her\nknitting--which she had seized so soon as Pierre had begun speaking--and\nwith trembling fingers was nervously twitching the points of her long\nneedles. It was plain that she awaited Pierre's accents with hardly much\nless eagerness than Isabel. Marking well this expression in Delly, and\napparently not unpleased with it, Pierre continued; but by no slightest\noutward tone or look seemed addressing his remarks to any one but\nIsabel.\n\n\"Now what I mean, dear Isabel, is this: if that very probable hostility\non the part of Miss Tartan's friends to her fulfilling her strange\nresolution--if any of that hostility should chance to be manifested\nunder thine eye, then thou certainly wilt know how to account for it;\nand as certainly wilt draw no inference from it in the minutest\nconceivable degree involving any thing sinister in me. No, I am sure\nthou wilt not, my dearest Isabel. For, understand me, regarding this\nstrange mood in my cousin as a thing wholly above my comprehension, and\nindeed regarding my poor cousin herself as a rapt enthusiast in some\nwild mystery utterly unknown to me; and unwilling ignorantly to\ninterfere in what almost seems some supernatural thing, I shall not\nrepulse her coming, however violently her friends may seek to stay it. I\nshall not repulse, as certainly as I have not invited. But a neutral\nattitude sometimes seems a suspicious one. Now what I mean is this: let\nall such vague suspicions of me, if any, be confined to Lucy's friends;\nbut let not such absurd misgivings come near my dearest Isabel, to give\nthe least uneasiness. Isabel! tell me; have I not now said enough to\nmake plain what I mean? Or, indeed, is not all I have said wholly\nunnecessary; seeing that when one feels deeply conscientious, one is\noften apt to seem superfluously, and indeed unpleasantly and\nunbeseemingly scrupulous? Speak, my own Isabel,\"--and he stept nearer to\nher, reaching forth his arm.\n\n\"Thy hand is the caster's ladle, Pierre, which holds me entirely fluid.\nInto thy forms and slightest moods of thought, thou pourest me; and I\nthere solidify to that form, and take it on, and thenceforth wear it,\ntill once more thou moldest me anew. If what thou tellest me be thy\nthought, then how can I help its being mine, my Pierre?\"\n\n\"The gods made thee of a holyday, when all the common world was done,\nand shaped thee leisurely in elaborate hours, thou paragon!\"\n\nSo saying, in a burst of admiring love and wonder, Pierre paced the\nroom; while Isabel sat silent, leaning on her hand, and half-vailed with\nher hair. Delly's nervous stitches became less convulsive. She seemed\nsoothed; some dark and vague conceit seemed driven out of her by\nsomething either directly expressed by Pierre, or inferred from his\nexpressions.\n\n\nIII.\n\n\"Pierre! Pierre!--Quick! Quick!--They are dragging me back!--oh, quick,\ndear Pierre!\"\n\n\"What is that?\" swiftly cried Isabel, rising to her feet, and amazedly\nglancing toward the door leading into the corridor.\n\nBut Pierre darted from the room, prohibiting any one from following him.\n\nHalf-way down the stairs, a slight, airy, almost unearthly figure was\nclinging to the balluster; and two young men, one in naval uniform, were\nvainly seeking to remove the two thin white hands without hurting them.\nThey were Glen Stanly, and Frederic, the elder brother of Lucy.\n\nIn a moment, Pierre's hands were among the rest.\n\n\"Villain!--Damn thee!\" cried Frederic; and letting go the hand of his\nsister, he struck fiercely at Pierre.\n\nBut the blow was intercepted by Pierre.\n\n\"Thou hast bewitched, thou damned juggler, the sweetest angel! Defend\nthyself!\"\n\n\"Nay, nay,\" cried Glen, catching the drawn rapier of the frantic\nbrother, and holding him in his powerful grasp; \"he is unarmed; this is\nno time or place to settle our feud with him. Thy sister,--sweet\nLucy--let us save her first, and then what thou wilt. Pierre\nGlendinning--if thou art but the little finger of a man--begone with\nthee from hence! Thy depravity, thy pollutedness, is that of a\nfiend!--Thou canst not desire this thing:--the sweet girl is mad!\"\n\nPierre stepped back a little, and looked palely and haggardly at all\nthree.\n\n\"I render no accounts: I am what I am. This sweet girl--this angel whom\nye two defile by your touches--she is of age by the law:--she is her own\nmistress by the law. And now, I swear she shall have her will! Unhand\nthe girl! Let her stand alone. See; she will faint; let her go, I say!\"\nAnd again his hands were among them.\n\nSuddenly, as they all, for the one instant vaguely struggled, the pale\ngirl drooped, and fell sideways toward Pierre; and, unprepared for this,\nthe two opposite champions, unconsciously relinquished their hold,\ntripped, and stumbled against each other, and both fell on the stairs.\nSnatching Lucy in his arms, Pierre darted from them; gained the door;\ndrove before him Isabel and Delly,--who, affrighted, had been lingering\nthere;--and bursting into the prepared chamber, laid Lucy on her cot;\nthen swiftly turned out of the room, and locked them all three in: and\nso swiftly--like lightning--was this whole thing done, that not till the\nlock clicked, did he find Glen and Frederic fiercely fronting him.\n\n\"Gentlemen, it is all over. This door is locked. She is in women's\nhands.--Stand back!\"\n\nAs the two infuriated young men now caught at him to hurl him aside,\nseveral of the Apostles rapidly entered, having been attracted by the\nnoise.\n\n\"Drag them off from me!\" cried Pierre. \"They are trespassers! drag them\noff!\"\n\nImmediately Glen and Frederic were pinioned by twenty hands; and, in\nobedience to a sign from Pierre, were dragged out of the room, and\ndragged down stairs; and given into the custody of a passing officer, as\ntwo disorderly youths invading the sanctuary of a private retreat.\n\nIn vain they fiercely expostulated; but at last, as if now aware that\nnothing farther could be done without some previous legal action, they\nmost reluctantly and chafingly declared themselves ready to depart.\nAccordingly they were let go; but not without a terrible menace of swift\nretribution directed to Pierre.\n\n\nIV.\n\nHappy is the dumb man in the hour of passion. He makes no impulsive\nthreats, and therefore seldom falsifies himself in the transition from\ncholer to calm.\n\nProceeding into the thoroughfare, after leaving the Apostles', it was\nnot very long ere Glen and Frederic concluded between themselves, that\nLucy could not so easily be rescued by threat or force. The pale,\ninscrutable determinateness, and flinchless intrepidity of Pierre, now\nbegan to domineer upon them; for any social unusualness or greatness is\nsometimes most impressive in the retrospect. What Pierre had said\nconcerning Lucy's being her own mistress in the eye of the law; this now\nrecurred to them. After much tribulation of thought, the more collected\nGlen proposed, that Frederic's mother should visit the rooms of Pierre;\nhe imagined, that though insensible to their own united intimidations,\nLucy might not prove deaf to the maternal prayers. Had Mrs. Tartan been\na different woman than she was; had she indeed any disinterested agonies\nof a generous heart, and not mere match-making mortifications, however\npoignant; then the hope of Frederic and Glen might have had more\nlikelihood in it. Nevertheless, the experiment was tried, but signally\nfailed.\n\nIn the combined presence of her mother, Pierre, Isabel, and Delly; and\naddressing Pierre and Isabel as Mr. and Mrs. Glendinning; Lucy took the\nmost solemn vows upon herself, to reside with her present host and\nhostess until they should cast her off. In vain her by turns suppliant,\nand exasperated mother went down on her knees to her, or seemed almost\non the point of smiting her; in vain she painted all the scorn and the\nloathing; sideways hinted of the handsome and gallant Glen; threatened\nher that in case she persisted, her entire family would renounce her;\nand though she should be starving, would not bestow one morsel upon such\na recreant, and infinitely worse than dishonorable girl.\n\nTo all this, Lucy--now entirely unmenaced in person--replied in the\ngentlest and most heavenly manner; yet with a collectedness, and\nsteadfastness, from which there was nothing to hope. What she was doing\nwas not of herself; she had been moved to it by all-encompassing\ninfluences above, around, and beneath. She felt no pain for her own\ncondition; her only suffering was sympathetic. She looked for no reward;\nthe essence of well-doing was the consciousness of having done well\nwithout the least hope of reward. Concerning the loss of worldly wealth\nand sumptuousness, and all the brocaded applauses of drawing-rooms;\nthese were no loss to her, for they had always been valueless. Nothing\nwas she now renouncing; but in acting upon her present inspiration she\nwas inheriting every thing. Indifferent to scorn, she craved no pity. As\nto the question of her sanity, that matter she referred to the verdict\nof angels, and not to the sordid opinions of man. If any one protested\nthat she was defying the sacred counsels of her mother, she had nothing\nto answer but this: that her mother possessed all her daughterly\ndeference, but her unconditional obedience was elsewhere due. Let all\nhope of moving her be immediately, and once for all, abandoned. One only\nthing could move her; and that would only move her, to make her forever\nimmovable;--that thing was death.\n\nSuch wonderful strength in such wonderful sweetness; such inflexibility\nin one so fragile, would have been matter for marvel to any observer.\nBut to her mother it was very much more; for, like many other\nsuperficial observers, forming her previous opinion of Lucy upon the\nslightness of her person, and the dulcetness of her temper, Mrs. Tartan\nhad always imagined that her daughter was quite incapable of any such\ndaring act. As if sterling heavenliness were incompatible with\nheroicness. These two are never found apart. Nor, though Pierre knew\nmore of Lucy than any one else, did this most singular behavior in her\nfail to amaze him. Seldom even had the mystery of Isabel fascinated him\nmore, with a fascination partaking of the terrible. The mere bodily\naspect of Lucy, as changed by her more recent life, filled him with the\nmost powerful and novel emotions. That unsullied complexion of bloom was\nnow entirely gone, without being any way replaced by sallowness, as is\nusual in similar instances. And as if her body indeed were the temple\nof God, and marble indeed were the only fit material for so holy a\nshrine, a brilliant, supernatural whiteness now gleamed in her cheek.\nHer head sat on her shoulders as a chiseled statue's head; and the soft,\nfirm light in her eye seemed as much a prodigy, as though a chiseled\nstatue should give token of vision and intelligence.\n\nIsabel also was most strangely moved by this sweet unearthliness in the\naspect of Lucy. But it did not so much persuade her by any common\nappeals to her heart, as irrespectively commend her by the very signet\nof heaven. In the deference with which she ministered to Lucy's little\noccasional wants, there was more of blank spontaneousness than\ncompassionate voluntariness. And when it so chanced, that--owing perhaps\nto some momentary jarring of the distant and lonely guitar--as Lucy was\nso mildly speaking in the presence of her mother, a sudden, just\naudible, submissively answering musical, stringed tone, came through the\nopen door from the adjoining chamber; then Isabel, as if seized by some\nspiritual awe, fell on her knees before Lucy, and made a rapid gesture\nof homage; yet still, somehow, as it were, without evidence of voluntary\nwill.\n\nFinding all her most ardent efforts ineffectual, Mrs. Tartan now\ndistressedly motioned to Pierre and Isabel to quit the chamber, that she\nmight urge her entreaties and menaces in private. But Lucy gently waved\nthem to stay; and then turned to her mother. Henceforth she had no\nsecrets but those which would also be secrets in heaven. Whatever was\npublicly known in heaven, should be publicly known on earth. There was\nno slightest secret between her and her mother.\n\nWholly confounded by this inscrutableness of her so alienated and\ninfatuated daughter, Mrs. Tartan turned inflamedly upon Pierre, and bade\nhim follow her forth. But again Lucy said nay, there were no secrets\nbetween her mother and Pierre. She would anticipate every thing there.\nCalling for pen and paper, and a book to hold on her knee and write,\nshe traced the following lines, and reached them to her mother:\n\n\"I am Lucy Tartan. I have come to dwell during their pleasure with Mr.\nand Mrs. Pierre Glendinning, of my own unsolicited free-will. If they\ndesire it, I shall go; but no other power shall remove me, except by\nviolence; and against any violence I have the ordinary appeal to the\nlaw.\"\n\n\"Read this, madam,\" said Mrs. Tartan, tremblingly handing it to Isabel,\nand eying her with a passionate and disdainful significance.\n\n\"I have read it,\" said Isabel, quietly, after a glance, and handing it\nto Pierre, as if by that act to show, that she had no separate decision\nin the matter.\n\n\"And do you, sir, too, indirectly connive?\" said Mrs. Tartan to Pierre,\nwhen he had read it.\n\n\"I render no accounts, madam. This seems to be the written and final\ncalm will of your daughter. As such, you had best respect it, and\ndepart.\"\n\nMrs. Tartan glanced despairingly and incensedly about her; then fixing\nher eyes on her daughter, spoke.\n\n\"Girl! here where I stand, I forever cast thee off. Never more shalt\nthou be vexed by my maternal entreaties. I shall instruct thy brothers\nto disown thee; I shall instruct Glen Stanly to banish thy worthless\nimage from his heart, if banished thence it be not already by thine own\nincredible folly and depravity. For thee, Mr. Monster! the judgment of\nGod will overtake thee for this. And for thee, madam, I have no words\nfor the woman who will connivingly permit her own husband's paramour to\ndwell beneath her roof. For thee, frail one,\" (to Delly), \"thou needest\nno amplification.--A nest of vileness! And now, surely, whom God himself\nhath abandoned forever, a mother may quit, never more to revisit.\"\n\nThis parting maternal malediction seemed to work no visibly\ncorresponding effect upon Lucy; already she was so marble-white, that\nfear could no more blanch her, if indeed fear was then at all within her\nheart. For as the highest, and purest, and thinnest ether remains\nunvexed by all the tumults of the inferior air; so that transparent\nether of her cheek, that clear mild azure of her eye, showed no sign of\npassion, as her terrestrial mother stormed below. Helpings she had from\nunstirring arms; glimpses she caught of aid invisible; sustained she was\nby those high powers of immortal Love, that once siding with the weakest\nreed which the utmost tempest tosses; then that utmost tempest shall be\nbroken down before the irresistible resistings of that weakest reed.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK XXV.\n\nLUCY, ISABEL, AND PIERRE. PIERRE AT HIS BOOK. ENCELADUS.\n\n\nI.\n\nA day or two after the arrival of Lucy, when she had quite recovered\nfrom any possible ill-effects of recent events,--events conveying such a\nshock to both Pierre and Isabel,--though to each in a quite different\nway,--but not, apparently, at least, moving Lucy so intensely--as they\nwere all three sitting at coffee, Lucy expressed her intention to\npractice her crayon art professionally. It would be so pleasant an\nemployment for her, besides contributing to their common fund. Pierre\nwell knew her expertness in catching likenesses, and judiciously and\ntruthfully beautifying them; not by altering the features so much, as by\nsteeping them in a beautifying atmosphere. For even so, said Lucy,\nthrown into the Lagoon, and there beheld--as I have heard--the roughest\nstones, without transformation, put on the softest aspects. If Pierre\nwould only take a little trouble to bring sitters to her room, she\ndoubted not a fine harvest of heads might easily be secured. Certainly,\namong the numerous inmates of the old Church, Pierre must know many who\nwould have no objections to being sketched. Moreover, though as yet she\nhad had small opportunity to see them; yet among such a remarkable\ncompany of poets, philosophers, and mystics of all sorts, there must be\nsome striking heads. In conclusion, she expressed her satisfaction at\nthe chamber prepared for her, inasmuch as having been formerly the\nstudio of an artist, one window had been considerably elevated, while by\na singular arrangement of the interior shutters, the light could in any\ndirection be thrown about at will.\n\nAlready Pierre had anticipated something of this sort; the first sight\nof the easel having suggested it to him. His reply was therefore not\nwholly unconsidered. He said, that so far as she herself was concerned,\nthe systematic practice of her art at present would certainly be a great\nadvantage in supplying her with a very delightful occupation. But since\nshe could hardly hope for any patronage from her mother's fashionable\nand wealthy associates; indeed, as such a thing must be very far from\nher own desires; and as it was only from the Apostles she could--for\nsome time to come, at least--reasonably anticipate sitters; and as those\nApostles were almost universally a very forlorn and penniless\nset--though in truth there were some wonderfully rich-looking heads\namong them--therefore, Lucy must not look for much immediate pecuniary\nemolument. Ere long she might indeed do something very handsome; but at\nthe outset, it was well to be moderate in her expectations. This\nadmonishment came, modifiedly, from that certain stoic, dogged mood of\nPierre, born of his recent life, which taught him never to expect any\ngood from any thing; but always to anticipate ill; however not in\nunreadiness to meet the contrary; and then, if good came, so much the\nbetter. He added that he would that very morning go among the rooms and\ncorridors of the Apostles, familiarly announcing that his cousin, a\nlady-artist in crayons, occupied a room adjoining his, where she would\nbe very happy to receive any sitters.\n\n\"And now, Lucy, what shall be the terms? That is a very important point,\nthou knowest.\"\n\n\"I suppose, Pierre, they must be very low,\" said Lucy, looking at him\nmeditatively.\n\n\"Very low, Lucy; very low, indeed.\"\n\n\"Well, ten dollars, then.\"\n\n\"Ten Banks of England, Lucy!\" exclaimed Pierre. \"Why, Lucy, that were\nalmost a quarter's income for some of the Apostles!\"\n\n\"Four dollars, Pierre.\"\n\n\"I will tell thee now, Lucy--but first, how long does it take to\ncomplete one portrait?\"\n\n\"Two sittings; and two mornings' work by myself, Pierre.\"\n\n\"And let me see; what are thy materials? They are not very costly, I\nbelieve. 'Tis not like cutting glass,--thy tools must not be pointed\nwith diamonds, Lucy?\"\n\n\"See, Pierre!\" said Lucy, holding out her little palm, \"see; this\nhandful of charcoal, a bit of bread, a crayon or two, and a square of\npaper:--that is all.\"\n\n\"Well, then, thou shalt charge one-seventy-five for a portrait.\"\n\n\"Only one-seventy-five, Pierre?\"\n\n\"I am half afraid now we have set it far too high, Lucy. Thou must not\nbe extravagant. Look: if thy terms were ten dollars, and thou didst\ncrayon on trust; then thou wouldst have plenty of sitters, but small\nreturns. But if thou puttest thy terms right-down, and also sayest thou\nmust have thy cash right-down too--don't start so at that _cash_--then\nnot so many sitters to be sure, but more returns. Thou understandest.\"\n\n\"It shall be just as thou say'st, Pierre.\"\n\n\"Well, then, I will write a card for thee, stating thy terms; and put it\nup conspicuously in thy room, so that every Apostle may know what he has\nto expect.\"\n\n\"Thank thee, thank thee, cousin Pierre,\" said Lucy, rising. \"I rejoice\nat thy pleasant and not entirely unhopeful view of my poor little plan.\nBut I must be doing something; I must be earning money. See, I have\neaten ever so much bread this morning, but have not earned one penny.\"\n\nWith a humorous sadness Pierre measured the large remainder of the one\nonly piece she had touched, and then would have spoken banteringly to\nher; but she had slid away into her own room.\n\nHe was presently roused from the strange revery into which the\nconclusion of this scene had thrown him, by the touch of Isabel's hand\nupon his knee, and her large expressive glance upon his face. During all\nthe foregoing colloquy, she had remained entirely silent; but an\nunoccupied observer would perhaps have noticed, that some new and very\nstrong emotions were restrainedly stirring within her.\n\n\"Pierre!\" she said, intently bending over toward him.\n\n\"Well, well, Isabel,\" stammeringly replied Pierre; while a mysterious\ncolor suffused itself over his whole face, neck, and brow; and\ninvoluntarily he started a little back from her self-proffering form.\n\nArrested by this movement Isabel eyed him fixedly; then slowly rose, and\nwith immense mournful stateliness, drew herself up, and said: \"If thy\nsister can ever come too nigh to thee, Pierre, tell thy sister so,\nbeforehand; for the September sun draws not up the valley-vapor more\njealously from the disdainful earth, than my secret god shall draw me up\nfrom thee, if ever I can come too nigh to thee.\"\n\nThus speaking, one hand was on her bosom, as if resolutely feeling of\nsomething deadly there concealed; but, riveted by her general manner\nmore than by her particular gesture, Pierre, at the instant, did not so\nparticularly note the all-significant movement of the hand upon her\nbosom, though afterward he recalled it, and darkly and thoroughly\ncomprehended its meaning.\n\n\"Too nigh to me, Isabel? Sun or dew, thou fertilizest me! Can sunbeams\nor drops of dew come too nigh the thing they warm and water? Then sit\ndown by me, Isabel, and sit close; wind in within my ribs,--if so thou\ncanst,--that my one frame may be the continent of two.\"\n\n\"Fine feathers make fine birds, so I have heard,\" said Isabel, most\nbitterly--\"but do fine sayings always make fine deeds? Pierre, thou\ndidst but just now draw away from me!\"\n\n\"When we would most dearly embrace, we first throw back our arms,\nIsabel; I but drew away, to draw so much the closer to thee.\"\n\n\"Well; all words are arrant skirmishers; deeds are the army's self! be\nit as thou sayest. I yet trust to thee.--Pierre.\"\n\n\"My breath waits thine; what is it, Isabel?\"\n\n\"I have been more blockish than a block; I am mad to think of it! More\nmad, that her great sweetness should first remind me of mine own\nstupidity. But she shall not get the start of me! Pierre, some way I\nmust work for thee! See, I will sell this hair; have these teeth pulled\nout; but some way I will earn money for thee!\"\n\nPierre now eyed her startledly. Touches of a determinate meaning shone\nin her; some hidden thing was deeply wounded in her. An affectionate\nsoothing syllable was on his tongue; his arm was out; when shifting his\nexpression, he whisperingly and alarmedly exclaimed--\"Hark! she is\ncoming.--Be still.\"\n\nBut rising boldly, Isabel threw open the connecting door, exclaiming\nhalf-hysterically--\"Look, Lucy; here is the strangest husband; fearful\nof being caught speaking to his wife!\"\n\nWith an artist's little box before her--whose rattling, perhaps, had\nstartled Pierre--Lucy was sitting midway in her room, opposite the\nopened door; so that at that moment, both Pierre and Isabel were plainly\nvisible to her. The singular tone of Isabel's voice instantly caused her\nto look up intently. At once, a sudden irradiation of some subtile\nintelligence--but whether welcome to her, or otherwise, could not be\ndetermined--shot over her whole aspect. She murmured some vague random\nreply; and then bent low over her box, saying she was very busy.\n\nIsabel closed the door, and sat down again by Pierre. Her countenance\nwore a mixed and writhing, impatient look. She seemed as one in whom the\nmost powerful emotion of life is caught in inextricable toils of\ncircumstances, and while longing to disengage itself, still knows that\nall struggles will prove worse than vain; and so, for the moment, grows\nmadly reckless and defiant of all obstacles. Pierre trembled as he gazed\nupon her. But soon the mood passed from her; her old, sweet mournfulness\nreturned; again the clear unfathomableness was in her mystic eye.\n\n\"Pierre, ere now,--ere I ever knew thee--I have done mad things, which I\nhave never been conscious of, but in the dim recalling. I hold such\nthings no things of mine. What I now remember, as just now done, was one\nof them.\"\n\n\"Thou hast done nothing but shown thy strength, while I have shown my\nweakness, Isabel;--yes, to the whole world thou art my wife--to her,\ntoo, thou art my wife. Have I not told her so, myself? I was weaker than\na kitten, Isabel; and thou, strong as those high things angelical, from\nwhich utmost beauty takes not strength.\"\n\n\"Pierre, once such syllables from thee, were all refreshing, and\nbedewing to me; now, though they drop as warmly and as fluidly from\nthee, yet falling through another and an intercepting zone, they freeze\non the way, and clatter on my heart like hail, Pierre.---- Thou didst\nnot speak thus to her!\"\n\n\"She is not Isabel.\"\n\nThe girl gazed at him with a quick and piercing scrutiny; then looked\nquite calm, and spoke. \"My guitar, Pierre: thou know'st how complete a\nmistress I am of it; now, before thou gettest sitters for the\nportrait-sketcher, thou shalt get pupils for the music-teacher. Wilt\nthou?\" and she looked at him with a persuasiveness and touchingness,\nwhich to Pierre, seemed more than mortal.\n\n\"My poor poor, Isabel!\" cried Pierre; \"thou art the mistress of the\nnatural sweetness of the guitar, not of its invented regulated\nartifices; and these are all that the silly pupil will pay for learning.\nAnd what thou hast can not be taught. Ah, thy sweet ignorance is all\ntransporting to me! my sweet, my sweet!--dear, divine girl!\" And\nimpulsively he caught her in his arms.\n\nWhile the first fire of his feeling plainly glowed upon him, but ere he\nhad yet caught her to him, Isabel had backward glided close to the\nconnecting door; which, at the instant of his embrace, suddenly opened,\nas by its own volition.\n\nBefore the eyes of seated Lucy, Pierre and Isabel stood locked; Pierre's\nlips upon her cheek.\n\n\nII.\n\nNotwithstanding the maternal visit of Mrs. Tartan, and the\nperemptoriness with which it had been closed by her declared departure\nnever to return, and her vow to teach all Lucy's relatives and friends,\nand Lucy's own brothers, and her suitor, to disown her, and forget her;\nyet Pierre fancied that he knew too much in general of the human heart,\nand too much in particular of the character of both Glen and Frederic,\nto remain entirely untouched by disquietude, concerning what those two\nfiery youths might now be plotting against him, as the imagined monster,\nby whose infernal tricks Lucy Tartan was supposed to have been seduced\nfrom every earthly seemliness. Not happily, but only so much the more\ngloomily, did he augur from the fact, that Mrs. Tartan had come to Lucy\nunattended; and that Glen and Frederic had let eight-and-forty hours and\nmore go by, without giving the slightest hostile or neutral sign. At\nfirst he thought, that bridling their impulsive fierceness, they were\nresolved to take the slower, but perhaps the surer method, to wrest Lucy\nback to them, by instituting some legal process. But this idea was\nrepulsed by more than one consideration.\n\nNot only was Frederic of that sort of temper, peculiar to military men,\nwhich would prompt him, in so closely personal and intensely private and\nfamily a matter, to scorn the hireling publicity of the law's lingering\narm; and impel him, as by the furiousness of fire, to be his own righter\nand avenger; for, in him, it was perhaps quite as much the feeling of an\noutrageous family affront to himself, through Lucy, as her own presumed\nseparate wrong, however black, which stung him to the quick: not only\nwere these things so respecting Frederic; but concerning Glen, Pierre\nwell knew, that be Glen heartless as he might, to do a deed of love,\nGlen was not heartless to do a deed of hate; that though, on that\nmemorable night of his arrival in the city, Glen had heartlessly closed\nhis door upon him, yet now Glen might heartfully burst Pierre's open, if\nby that he at all believed, that permanent success would crown the fray.\n\nBesides, Pierre knew this;--that so invincible is the natural,\nuntamable, latent spirit of a courageous manliness in man, that though\nnow socially educated for thousands of years in an arbitrary homage to\nthe Law, as the one only appointed redress for every injured person; yet\nimmemorially and universally, among all gentlemen of spirit, once to\nhave uttered independent personal threats of personal vengeance against\nyour foe, and then, after that, to fall back slinking into a court, and\nhire with sops a pack of yelping pettifoggers to fight the battle so\nvaliantly proclaimed; this, on the surface, is ever deemed very\ndecorous, and very prudent--a most wise second thought; but, at bottom,\na miserably ignoble thing. Frederic was not the watery man for\nthat,--Glen had more grapey blood in him.\n\nMoreover, it seemed quite clear to Pierre, that only by making out Lucy\nabsolutely mad, and striving to prove it by a thousand despicable little\nparticulars, could the law succeed in tearing her from the refuge she\nhad voluntarily sought; a course equally abhorrent to all the parties\npossibly to be concerned on either side.\n\nWhat then would those two boiling bloods do? Perhaps they would patrol\nthe streets; and at the first glimpse of lonely Lucy, kidnap her home.\nOr if Pierre were with her, then, smite him down by hook or crook, fair\nplay or foul; and then, away with Lucy! Or if Lucy systematically kept\nher room, then fall on Pierre in the most public way, fell him, and\ncover him from all decent recognition beneath heaps on heaps of hate and\ninsult; so that broken on the wheel of such dishonor, Pierre might feel\nhimself unstrung, and basely yield the prize.\n\nNot the gibbering of ghosts in any old haunted house; no sulphurous and\nportentous sign at night beheld in heaven, will so make the hair to\nstand, as when a proud and honorable man is revolving in his soul the\npossibilities of some gross public and corporeal disgrace. It is not\nfear; it is a pride-horror, which is more terrible than any fear. Then,\nby tremendous imagery, the murderer's mark of Cain is felt burning on\nthe brow, and the already acquitted knife blood-rusts in the clutch of\nthe anticipating hand.\n\nCertain that those two youths must be plotting something furious against\nhim; with the echoes of their scorning curses on the stairs still\nringing in his ears--curses, whose swift responses from himself, he, at\nthe time, had had much ado to check;--thoroughly alive to the\nsupernaturalism of that mad frothing hate which a spirited brother forks\nforth at the insulter of a sister's honor--beyond doubt the most\nuncompromising of all the social passions known to man--and not blind to\nthe anomalous fact, that if such a brother stab his foe at his own\nmother's table, all people and all juries would bear him out, accounting\nevery thing allowable to a noble soul made mad by a sweet sister's shame\ncaused by a damned seducer;--imagining to himself his own feelings, if\nhe were actually in the position which Frederic so vividly fancied to\nbe his; remembering that in love matters jealousy is as an adder, and\nthat the jealousy of Glen was double-addered by the extraordinary malice\nof the apparent circumstances under which Lucy had spurned Glen's arms,\nand fled to his always successful and now married rival, as if wantonly\nand shamelessly to nestle there;--remembering all these intense\nincitements of both those foes of his, Pierre could not but look forward\nto wild work very soon to come. Nor was the storm of passion in his soul\nunratified by the decision of his coolest possible hour. Storm and calm\nboth said to him,--Look to thyself, oh Pierre!\n\nMurders are done by maniacs; but the earnest thoughts of murder, these\nare the collected desperadoes. Pierre was such; fate, or what you will,\nhad made him such. But such he was. And when these things now swam\nbefore him; when he thought of all the ambiguities which hemmed him in;\nthe stony walls all round that he could not overleap; the million\naggravations of his most malicious lot; the last lingering hope of\nhappiness licked up from him as by flames of fire, and his one only\nprospect a black, bottomless gulf of guilt, upon whose verge he\nimminently teetered every hour;--then the utmost hate of Glen and\nFrederic were jubilantly welcome to him; and murder, done in the act of\nwarding off their ignominious public blow, seemed the one only congenial\nsequel to such a desperate career.\n\n\nIII.\n\nAs a statue, planted on a revolving pedestal, shows now this limb, now\nthat; now front, now back, now side; continually changing, too, its\ngeneral profile; so does the pivoted, statued soul of man, when turned\nby the hand of Truth. Lies only never vary; look for no invariableness\nin Pierre. Nor does any canting showman here stand by to announce his\nphases as he revolves. Catch his phases as your insight may.\n\nAnother day passed on; Glen and Frederic still absenting themselves, and\nPierre and Isabel and Lucy all dwelling together. The domestic presence\nof Lucy had begun to produce a remarkable effect upon Pierre. Sometimes,\nto the covertly watchful eye of Isabel, he would seem to look upon Lucy\nwith an expression illy befitting their singular and so-supposed merely\ncousinly relation; and yet again, with another expression still more\nunaccountable to her,--one of fear and awe, not unmixed with impatience.\nBut his general detailed manner toward Lucy was that of the most\ndelicate and affectionate considerateness--nothing more. He was never\nalone with her; though, as before, at times alone with Isabel.\n\nLucy seemed entirely undesirous of usurping any place about him;\nmanifested no slightest unwelcome curiosity as to Pierre, and no painful\nembarrassment as to Isabel. Nevertheless, more and more did she seem,\nhour by hour, to be somehow inexplicably sliding between them, without\ntouching them. Pierre felt that some strange heavenly influence was near\nhim, to keep him from some uttermost harm; Isabel was alive to some\nuntraceable displacing agency. Though when all three were together, the\nmarvelous serenity, and sweetness, and utter unsuspectingness of Lucy\nobviated any thing like a common embarrassment: yet if there was any\nembarrassment at all beneath that roof, it was sometimes when Pierre was\nalone with Isabel, after Lucy would innocently quit them.\n\nMeantime Pierre was still going on with his book; every moment becoming\nstill the more sensible of the intensely inauspicious circumstances of\nall sorts under which that labor was proceeding. And as the now\nadvancing and concentring enterprise demanded more and more compacted\nvigor from him, he felt that he was having less and less to bring to it.\nFor not only was it the signal misery of Pierre, to be\ninvisibly--though but accidentally--goaded, in the hour of mental\nimmaturity, to the attempt at a mature work,--a circumstance\nsufficiently lamentable in itself; but also, in the hour of his\nclamorous pennilessness, he was additionally goaded into an enterprise\nlong and protracted in the execution, and of all things least calculated\nfor pecuniary profit in the end. How these things were so, whence they\noriginated, might be thoroughly and very beneficially explained; but\nspace and time here forbid.\n\nAt length, domestic matters--rent and bread--had come to such a pass\nwith him, that whether or no, the first pages must go to the printer;\nand thus was added still another tribulation; because the printed pages\nnow dictated to the following manuscript, and said to all subsequent\nthoughts and inventions of Pierre--_Thus and thus_; _so and so_; _else\nan ill match_. Therefore, was his book already limited, bound over, and\ncommitted to imperfection, even before it had come to any confirmed form\nor conclusion at all. Oh, who shall reveal the horrors of poverty in\nauthorship that is high? While the silly Millthorpe was railing against\nhis delay of a few weeks and months; how bitterly did unreplying Pierre\nfeel in his heart, that to most of the great works of humanity, their\nauthors had given, not weeks and months, not years and years, but their\nwholly surrendered and dedicated lives. On either hand clung to by a\ngirl who would have laid down her life for him; Pierre, nevertheless, in\nhis deepest, highest part, was utterly without sympathy from any thing\ndivine, human, brute, or vegetable. One in a city of hundreds of\nthousands of human beings, Pierre was solitary as at the Pole.\n\nAnd the great woe of all was this: that all these things were\nunsuspected without, and undivulgible from within; the very daggers that\nstabbed him were joked at by Imbecility, Ignorance, Blockheadedness,\nSelf-Complacency, and the universal Blearedness and Besottedness around\nhim. Now he began to feel that in him, the thews of a Titan were\nforestallingly cut by the scissors of Fate. He felt as a moose,\nhamstrung. All things that think, or move, or lie still, seemed as\ncreated to mock and torment him. He seemed gifted with loftiness, merely\nthat it might be dragged down to the mud. Still, the profound\nwillfulness in him would not give up. Against the breaking heart, and\nthe bursting head; against all the dismal lassitude, and deathful\nfaintness and sleeplessness, and whirlingness, and craziness, still he\nlike a demigod bore up. His soul's ship foresaw the inevitable rocks,\nbut resolved to sail on, and make a courageous wreck. Now he gave jeer\nfor jeer, and taunted the apes that jibed him. With the soul of an\nAtheist, he wrote down the godliest things; with the feeling of misery\nand death in him, he created forms of gladness and life. For the pangs\nin his heart, he put down hoots on the paper. And every thing else he\ndisguised under the so conveniently adjustable drapery of\nall-stretchable Philosophy. For the more and the more that he wrote, and\nthe deeper and the deeper that he dived, Pierre saw the everlasting\nelusiveness of Truth; the universal lurking insincerity of even the\ngreatest and purest written thoughts. Like knavish cards, the leaves of\nall great books were covertly packed. He was but packing one set the\nmore; and that a very poor jaded set and pack indeed. So that there was\nnothing he more spurned, than his own aspirations; nothing he more\nabhorred than the loftiest part of himself. The brightest success, now\nseemed intolerable to him, since he so plainly saw, that the brightest\nsuccess could not be the sole offspring of Merit; but of Merit for the\none thousandth part, and nine hundred and ninety-nine combining and\ndove-tailing accidents for the rest. So beforehand he despised those\nlaurels which in the very nature of things, can never be impartially\nbestowed. But while thus all the earth was depopulated of ambition for\nhim; still circumstances had put him in the attitude of an eager\ncontender for renown. So beforehand he felt the unrevealable sting of\nreceiving either plaudits or censures, equally unsought for, and\nequally loathed ere given. So, beforehand he felt the pyramidical scorn\nof the genuine loftiness for the whole infinite company of infinitesimal\ncritics. His was the scorn which thinks it not worth the while to be\nscornful. Those he most scorned, never knew it. In that lonely little\ncloset of his, Pierre foretasted all that this world hath either of\npraise or dispraise; and thus foretasting both goblets, anticipatingly\nhurled them both in its teeth. All panegyric, all denunciation, all\ncriticism of any sort, would come too late for Pierre.\n\nBut man does never give himself up thus, a doorless and shutterless\nhouse for the four loosened winds of heaven to howl through, without\nstill additional dilapidations. Much oftener than before, Pierre laid\nback in his chair with the deadly feeling of faintness. Much oftener\nthan before, came staggering home from his evening walk, and from sheer\nbodily exhaustion economized the breath that answered the anxious\ninquiries as to what might be done for him. And as if all the leagued\nspiritual inveteracies and malices, combined with his general bodily\nexhaustion, were not enough, a special corporeal affliction now\ndescended like a sky-hawk upon him. His incessant application told upon\nhis eyes. They became so affected, that some days he wrote with the lids\nnearly closed, fearful of opening them wide to the light. Through the\nlashes he peered upon the paper, which so seemed fretted with wires.\nSometimes he blindly wrote with his eyes turned away from the\npaper;--thus unconsciously symbolizing the hostile necessity and\ndistaste, the former whereof made of him this most unwilling\nstates-prisoner of letters.\n\nAs every evening, after his day's writing was done, the proofs of the\nbeginning of his work came home for correction, Isabel would read them\nto him. They were replete with errors; but preoccupied by the thronging,\nand undiluted, pure imaginings of things, he became impatient of such\nminute, gnat-like torments; he randomly corrected the worst, and let\nthe rest go; jeering with himself at the rich harvest thus furnished to\nthe entomological critics.\n\nBut at last he received a tremendous interior intimation, to hold\noff--to be still from his unnatural struggle.\n\nIn the earlier progress of his book, he had found some relief in making\nhis regular evening walk through the greatest thoroughfare of the city;\nthat so, the utter isolation of his soul, might feel itself the more\nintensely from the incessant jogglings of his body against the bodies of\nthe hurrying thousands. Then he began to be sensible of more fancying\nstormy nights, than pleasant ones; for then, the great thoroughfares\nwere less thronged, and the innumerable shop-awnings flapped and beat\nlike schooners' broad sails in a gale, and the shutters banged like\nlashed bulwarks; and the slates fell hurtling like displaced ship's\nblocks from aloft. Stemming such tempests through the deserted streets,\nPierre felt a dark, triumphant joy; that while others had crawled in\nfear to their kennels, he alone defied the storm-admiral, whose most\nvindictive peltings of hail-stones,--striking his iron-framed fiery\nfurnace of a body,--melted into soft dew, and so, harmlessly trickled\nfrom off him.\n\nBy-and-by, of such howling, pelting nights, he began to bend his steps\ndown the dark, narrow side-streets, in quest of the more secluded and\nmysterious tap-rooms. There he would feel a singular satisfaction, in\nsitting down all dripping in a chair, ordering his half-pint of ale\nbefore him, and drawing over his cap to protect his eyes from the light,\neye the varied faces of the social castaways, who here had their haunts\nfrom the bitterest midnights.\n\nBut at last he began to feel a distaste for even these; and now nothing\nbut the utter night-desolation of the obscurest warehousing lanes would\ncontent him, or be at all sufferable to him. Among these he had now been\naccustomed to wind in and out every evening; till one night as he paused\na moment previous to turning about for home, a sudden, unwonted, and\nall-pervading sensation seized him. He knew not where he was; he did not\nhave any ordinary life-feeling at all. He could not see; though\ninstinctively putting his hand to his eyes, he seemed to feel that the\nlids were open. Then he was sensible of a combined blindness, and\nvertigo, and staggering; before his eyes a million green meteors danced;\nhe felt his foot tottering upon the curb, he put out his hands, and knew\nno more for the time. When he came to himself he found that he was lying\ncrosswise in the gutter, dabbled with mud and slime. He raised himself\nto try if he could stand; but the fit was entirely gone. Immediately he\nquickened his steps homeward, forbearing to rest or pause at all on the\nway, lest that rush of blood to his head, consequent upon his sudden\ncessation from walking, should again smite him down. This circumstance\nwarned him away from those desolate streets, lest the repetition of the\nfit should leave him there to perish by night in unknown and unsuspected\nloneliness. But if that terrible vertigo had been also intended for\nanother and deeper warning, he regarded such added warning not at all;\nbut again plied heart and brain as before.\n\nBut now at last since the very blood in his body had in vain rebelled\nagainst his Titanic soul; now the only visible outward symbols of that\nsoul--his eyes--did also turn downright traitors to him, and with more\nsuccess than the rebellious blood. He had abused them so recklessly,\nthat now they absolutely refused to look on paper. He turned them on\npaper, and they blinked and shut. The pupils of his eyes rolled away\nfrom him in their own orbits. He put his hand up to them, and sat back\nin his seat. Then, without saying one word, he continued there for his\nusual term, suspended, motionless, blank.\n\nBut next morning--it was some few days after the arrival of Lucy--still\nfeeling that a certain downright infatuation, and no less, is both\nunavoidable and indispensable in the composition of any great, deep\nbook, or even any wholly unsuccessful attempt at any great, deep book;\nnext morning he returned to the charge. But again the pupils of his eyes\nrolled away from him in their orbits: and now a general and nameless\ntorpor--some horrible foretaste of death itself--seemed stealing upon\nhim.\n\n\nIV.\n\nDuring this state of semi-unconsciousness, or rather trance, a\nremarkable dream or vision came to him. The actual artificial objects\naround him slid from him, and were replaced by a baseless yet most\nimposing spectacle of natural scenery. But though a baseless vision in\nitself, this airy spectacle assumed very familiar features to Pierre. It\nwas the phantasmagoria of the Mount of the Titans, a singular height\nstanding quite detached in a wide solitude not far from the grand range\nof dark blue hills encircling his ancestral manor.\n\nSay what some poets will, Nature is not so much her own ever-sweet\ninterpreter, as the mere supplier of that cunning alphabet, whereby\nselecting and combining as he pleases, each man reads his own peculiar\nlesson according to his own peculiar mind and mood. Thus a\nhigh-aspiring, but most moody, disappointed bard, chancing once to visit\nthe Meadows and beholding that fine eminence, christened it by the name\nit ever after bore; completely extinguishing its former title--The\nDelectable Mountain--one long ago bestowed by an old Baptist farmer, an\nhereditary admirer of Bunyan and his most marvelous book. From the spell\nof that name the mountain never afterward escaped; for now, gazing upon\nit by the light of those suggestive syllables, no poetical observer\ncould resist the apparent felicity of the title. For as if indeed the\nimmemorial mount would fain adapt itself to its so recent name, some\npeople said that it had insensibly changed its pervading aspect within a\nscore or two of winters. Nor was this strange conceit entirely without\nfoundation, seeing that the annual displacements of huge rocks and\ngigantic trees were continually modifying its whole front and general\ncontour.\n\nOn the north side, where it fronted the old Manor-house, some fifteen\nmiles distant, the height, viewed from the piazza of a soft\nhaze-canopied summer's noon, presented a long and beautiful, but not\nentirely inaccessible-looking purple precipice, some two thousand feet\nin air, and on each hand sideways sloping down to lofty terraces of\npastures.\n\nThose hill-side pastures, be it said, were thickly sown with a small\nwhite amaranthine flower, which, being irreconcilably distasteful to the\ncattle, and wholly rejected by them, and yet, continually multiplying on\nevery hand, did by no means contribute to the agricultural value of\nthose elevated lands. Insomuch, that for this cause, the disheartened\ndairy tenants of that part of the Manor, had petitioned their\nlady-landlord for some abatement in their annual tribute of upland\ngrasses, in the Juny-load; rolls of butter in the October crock; and\nsteers and heifers on the October hoof; with turkeys in the Christmas\nsleigh.\n\n\"The small white flower, it is our bane!\" the imploring tenants cried.\n\"The aspiring amaranth, every year it climbs and adds new terraces to\nits sway! The immortal amaranth, it will not die, but last year's\nflowers survive to this! The terraced pastures grow glittering white,\nand in warm June still show like banks of snow:--fit token of the\nsterileness the amaranth begets! Then free us from the amaranth, good\nlady, or be pleased to abate our rent!\"\n\nNow, on a somewhat nearer approach, the precipice did not belie its\npurple promise from the manorial piazza--that sweet imposing purple\npromise, which seemed fully to vindicate the Bunyanish old title\noriginally bestowed;--but showed the profuse aerial foliage of a hanging\nforest. Nevertheless, coming still more nigh, long and frequent rents\namong the mass of leaves revealed horrible glimpses of dark-dripping\nrocks, and mysterious mouths of wolfish caves. Struck by this most\nunanticipated view, the tourist now quickened his impulsive steps to\nverify the change by coming into direct contact with so chameleon a\nheight. As he would now speed on, the lower ground, which from the\nmanor-house piazza seemed all a grassy level, suddenly merged into a\nvery long and weary acclivity, slowly rising close up to the precipice's\nbase; so that the efflorescent grasses rippled against it, as the\nefflorescent waves of some great swell or long rolling billow ripple\nagainst the water-line of a steep gigantic war-ship on the sea. And, as\namong the rolling sea-like sands of Egypt, disordered rows of broken\nSphinxes lead to the Cheopian pyramid itself; so this long acclivity was\nthickly strewn with enormous rocky masses, grotesque in shape, and with\nwonderful features on them, which seemed to express that slumbering\nintelligence visible in some recumbent beasts--beasts whose intelligence\nseems struck dumb in them by some sorrowful and inexplicable spell.\nNevertheless, round and round those still enchanted rocks, hard by their\nutmost rims, and in among their cunning crevices, the misanthropic\nhill-scaling goat nibbled his sweetest food; for the rocks, so barren in\nthemselves, distilled a subtile moisture, which fed with greenness all\nthings that grew about their igneous marge.\n\nQuitting those recumbent rocks, you still ascended toward the hanging\nforest, and piercing within its lowermost fringe, then suddenly you\nstood transfixed, as a marching soldier confounded at the sight of an\nimpregnable redoubt, where he had fancied it a practicable vault to his\ncourageous thews. Cunningly masked hitherto, by the green tapestry of\nthe interlacing leaves, a terrific towering palisade of dark mossy\nmassiness confronted you; and, trickling with unevaporable moisture,\ndistilled upon you from its beetling brow slow thunder-showers of\nwater-drops, chill as the last dews of death. Now you stood and shivered\nin that twilight, though it were high noon and burning August down the\nmeads. All round and round, the grim scarred rocks rallied and\nre-rallied themselves; shot up, protruded, stretched, swelled, and\neagerly reached forth; on every side bristlingly radiating with a\nhideous repellingness. Tossed, and piled, and indiscriminate among\nthese, like bridging rifts of logs up-jammed in alluvial-rushing streams\nof far Arkansas: or, like great masts and yards of overwhelmed fleets\nhurled high and dashed amain, all splintering together, on hovering\nridges of the Atlantic sea,--you saw the melancholy trophies which the\nNorth Wind, championing the unquenchable quarrel of the Winter, had\nwrested from the forests, and dismembered them on their own chosen\nbattle-ground, in barbarous disdain. 'Mid this spectacle of wide and\nwanton spoil, insular noises of falling rocks would boomingly explode\nupon the silence and fright all the echoes, which ran shrieking in and\nout among the caves, as wailing women and children in some assaulted\ntown.\n\nStark desolation; ruin, merciless and ceaseless; chills and gloom,--all\nhere lived a hidden life, curtained by that cunning purpleness, which,\nfrom the piazza of the manor house, so beautifully invested the mountain\nonce called Delectable, but now styled Titanic.\n\nBeaten off by such undreamed-of glooms and steeps, you now sadly\nretraced your steps, and, mayhap, went skirting the inferior sideway\nterraces of pastures; where the multiple and most sterile inodorous\nimmortalness of the small, white flower furnished no aliment for the\nmild cow's meditative cud. But here and there you still might smell from\nfar the sweet aromaticness of clumps of catnip, that dear farm-house\nherb. Soon you would see the modest verdure of the plant itself; and\nwheresoever you saw that sight, old foundation stones and rotting\ntimbers of log-houses long extinct would also meet your eye; their\ndesolation illy hid by the green solicitudes of the unemigrating herb.\nMost fitly named the catnip; since, like the unrunagate cat, though all\nthat's human forsake the place, that plant will long abide, long bask\nand bloom on the abandoned hearth. Illy hid; for every spring the\namaranthine and celestial flower gained on the mortal household herb;\nfor every autumn the catnip died, but never an autumn made the amaranth\nto wane. The catnip and the amaranth!--man's earthly household peace,\nand the ever-encroaching appetite for God.\n\nNo more now you sideways followed the sad pasture's skirt, but took your\nway adown the long declivity, fronting the mystic height. In mid field\nagain you paused among the recumbent sphinx-like shapes thrown off from\nthe rocky steep. You paused; fixed by a form defiant, a form of\nawfulness. You saw Enceladus the Titan, the most potent of all the\ngiants, writhing from out the imprisoning earth;--turbaned with upborn\nmoss he writhed; still, though armless, resisting with his whole\nstriving trunk, the Pelion and the Ossa hurled back at him;--turbaned\nwith upborn moss he writhed; still turning his unconquerable front\ntoward that majestic mount eternally in vain assailed by him, and which,\nwhen it had stormed him off, had heaved his undoffable incubus upon him,\nand deridingly left him there to bay out his ineffectual howl.\n\nTo Pierre this wondrous shape had always been a thing of interest,\nthough hitherto all its latent significance had never fully and\nintelligibly smitten him. In his earlier boyhood a strolling company of\nyoung collegian pedestrians had chanced to light upon the rock; and,\nstruck with its remarkableness, had brought a score of picks and spades,\nand dug round it to unearth it, and find whether indeed it were a\ndemoniac freak of nature, or some stern thing of antediluvian art.\nAccompanying this eager party, Pierre first beheld that deathless son of\nTerra. At that time, in its untouched natural state, the statue\npresented nothing but the turbaned head of igneous rock rising from out\nthe soil, with its unabasable face turned upward toward the mountain,\nand the bull-like neck clearly defined. With distorted features, scarred\nand broken, and a black brow mocked by the upborn moss, Enceladus there\nsubterraneously stood, fast frozen into the earth at the junction of the\nneck. Spades and picks soon heaved part of his Ossa from him, till at\nlast a circular well was opened round him to the depth of some thirteen\nfeet. At that point the wearied young collegians gave over their\nenterprise in despair. With all their toil, they had not yet come to the\ngirdle of Enceladus. But they had bared good part of his mighty chest,\nand exposed his mutilated shoulders, and the stumps of his once\naudacious arms. Thus far uncovering his shame, in that cruel plight they\nhad abandoned him, leaving stark naked his in vain indignant chest to\nthe defilements of the birds, which for untold ages had cast their\nfoulness on his vanquished crest.\n\nNot unworthy to be compared with that leaden Titan, wherewith the art of\nMarsy and the broad-flung pride of Bourbon enriched the enchanted\ngardens of Versailles;--and from whose still twisted mouth for sixty\nfeet the waters yet upgush, in elemental rivalry with those Etna flames,\nof old asserted to be the malicious breath of the borne-down giant;--not\nunworthy to be compared with that leaden demi-god--piled with costly\nrocks, and with one bent wrenching knee protruding from the broken\nbronze;--not unworthy to be compared with that bold trophy of high art,\nthis American Enceladus, wrought by the vigorous hand of Nature's self,\nit did go further than compare;--it did far surpass that fine figure\nmolded by the inferior skill of man. Marsy gave arms to the eternally\ndefenseless; but Nature, more truthful, performed an amputation, and\nleft the impotent Titan without one serviceable ball-and-socket above\nthe thigh.\n\nSuch was the wild scenery--the Mount of Titans, and the repulsed group\nof heaven-assaulters, with Enceladus in their midst shamefully recumbent\nat its base;--such was the wild scenery, which now to Pierre, in his\nstrange vision, displaced the four blank walls, the desk, and camp-bed,\nand domineered upon his trance. But no longer petrified in all their\nignominious attitudes, the herded Titans now sprung to their feet; flung\nthemselves up the slope; and anew battered at the precipice's\nunresounding wall. Foremost among them all, he saw a moss-turbaned,\narmless giant, who despairing of any other mode of wreaking his\nimmitigable hate, turned his vast trunk into a battering-ram, and hurled\nhis own arched-out ribs again and yet again against the invulnerable\nsteep.\n\n\"Enceladus! it is Enceladus!\"--Pierre cried out in his sleep. That\nmoment the phantom faced him; and Pierre saw Enceladus no more; but on\nthe Titan's armless trunk, his own duplicate face and features\nmagnifiedly gleamed upon him with prophetic discomfiture and woe. With\ntrembling frame he started from his chair, and woke from that ideal\nhorror to all his actual grief.\n\n\nV.\n\nNor did Pierre's random knowledge of the ancient fables fail still\nfurther to elucidate the vision which so strangely had supplied a tongue\nto muteness. But that elucidation was most repulsively fateful and\nforeboding; possibly because Pierre did not leap the final barrier of\ngloom; possibly because Pierre did not willfully wrest some final\ncomfort from the fable; did not flog this stubborn rock as Moses his,\nand force even aridity itself to quench his painful thirst.\n\nThus smitten, the Mount of Titans seems to yield this following\nstream:--\n\nOld Titan's self was the son of incestuous Coelus and Terra, the son\nof incestuous Heaven and Earth. And Titan married his mother Terra,\nanother and accumulatively incestuous match. And thereof Enceladus was\none issue. So Enceladus was both the son and grandson of an incest; and\neven thus, there had been born from the organic blended heavenliness and\nearthliness of Pierre, another mixed, uncertain, heaven-aspiring, but\nstill not wholly earth-emancipated mood; which again, by its terrestrial\ntaint held down to its terrestrial mother, generated there the present\ndoubly incestuous Enceladus within him; so that the present mood of\nPierre--that reckless sky-assaulting mood of his, was nevertheless on\none side the grandson of the sky. For it is according to eternal\nfitness, that the precipitated Titan should still seek to regain his\npaternal birthright even by fierce escalade. Wherefore whoso storms the\nsky gives best proof he came from thither! But whatso crawls contented\nin the moat before that crystal fort, shows it was born within that\nslime, and there forever will abide.\n\nRecovered somewhat from the after-spell of this wild vision folded in\nhis trance, Pierre composed his front as best he might, and straightway\nleft his fatal closet. Concentrating all the remaining stuff in him, he\nresolved by an entire and violent change, and by a willful act against\nhis own most habitual inclinations, to wrestle with the strange malady\nof his eyes, this new death-fiend of the trance, and this Inferno of his\nTitanic vision.\n\nAnd now, just as he crossed the threshold of the closet, he writhingly\nstrove to assume an expression intended to be not uncheerful--though how\nindeed his countenance at all looked, he could not tell; for dreading\nsome insupportably dark revealments in his glass, he had of late wholly\nabstained from appealing to it--and in his mind he rapidly conned over,\nwhat indifferent, disguising, or light-hearted gamesome things he\nshould say, when proposing to his companions the little design he\ncherished.\n\nAnd even so, to grim Enceladus, the world the gods had chained for a\nball to drag at his o'erfreighted feet;--even so that globe put forth a\nthousand flowers, whose fragile smiles disguised his ponderous load.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK XXVI.\n\nA WALK: A FOREIGN PORTRAIT: A SAIL: AND THE END.\n\n\nI.\n\n\"Come, Isabel, come, Lucy; we have not had a single walk together yet.\nIt is cold, but clear; and once out of the city, we shall find it sunny.\nCome: get ready now, and away for a stroll down to the wharf, and then\nfor some of the steamers on the bay. No doubt, Lucy, you will find in\nthe bay scenery some hints for that secret sketch you are so busily\noccupied with--ere real living sitters do come--and which you so\ndevotedly work at, all alone and behind closed doors.\"\n\nUpon this, Lucy's original look of pale-rippling pleasantness and\nsurprise--evoked by Pierre's unforeseen proposition to give himself some\nrelaxation--changed into one of infinite, mute, but unrenderable\nmeaning, while her swimming eyes gently, yet all-bewildered, fell to the\nfloor.\n\n\"It is finished, then,\" cried Isabel,--not unmindful of this by-scene,\nand passionately stepping forward so as to intercept Pierre's momentary\nrapt glance at the agitated Lucy,--\"That vile book, it is\nfinished!--Thank Heaven!\"\n\n\"Not so,\" said Pierre; and, displacing all disguisements, a hectic\nunsummoned expression suddenly came to his face;--\"but ere that vile\nbook be finished, I must get on some other element than earth. I have\nsat on earth's saddle till I am weary; I must now vault over to the\nother saddle awhile. Oh, seems to me, there should be two ceaseless\nsteeds for a bold man to ride,--the Land and the Sea; and like\ncircus-men we should never dismount, but only be steadied and rested by\nleaping from one to the other, while still, side by side, they both race\nround the sun. I have been on the Land steed so long, oh I am dizzy!\"\n\n\"Thou wilt never listen to me, Pierre,\" said Lucy lowly; \"there is no\nneed of this incessant straining. See, Isabel and I have both offered to\nbe thy amanuenses;--not in mere copying, but in the original writing; I\nam sure that would greatly assist thee.\"\n\n\"Impossible! I fight a duel in which all seconds are forbid.\"\n\n\"Ah Pierre! Pierre!\" cried Lucy, dropping the shawl in her hand, and\ngazing at him with unspeakable longings of some unfathomable emotion.\n\nNamelessly glancing at Lucy, Isabel slid near to him, seized his hand\nand spoke.\n\n\"I would go blind for thee, Pierre; here, take out these eyes, and use\nthem for glasses.\" So saying, she looked with a strange momentary\nhaughtiness and defiance at Lucy.\n\nA general half involuntary movement was now made, as if they were about\nto depart.\n\n\"Ye are ready; go ye before\"--said Lucy meekly; \"I will follow.\"\n\n\"Nay, one on each arm\"--said Pierre--\"come!\"\n\nAs they passed through the low arched vestibule into the street, a\ncheek-burnt, gamesome sailor passing, exclaimed--\"Steer small, my lad;\n'tis a narrow strait thou art in!\"\n\n\"What says he?\"--said Lucy gently. \"Yes, it is a narrow strait of a\nstreet indeed.\"\n\nBut Pierre felt a sudden tremble transferred to him from Isabel, who\nwhispered something inarticulate in his ear.\n\nGaining one of the thoroughfares, they drew near to a conspicuous\nplacard over a door, announcing that above stairs was a gallery of\npaintings, recently imported from Europe, and now on free exhibition\npreparatory to their sale by auction. Though this encounter had been\nentirely unforeseen by Pierre, yet yielding to the sudden impulse, he at\nonce proposed their visiting the pictures. The girls assented, and they\nascended the stairs.\n\nIn the anteroom, a catalogue was put into his hand. He paused to give\none hurried, comprehensive glance at it. Among long columns of such\nnames as Rubens, Raphael, Angelo, Domenichino, Da Vinci, all shamelessly\nprefaced with the words \"undoubted,\" or \"testified,\" Pierre met the\nfollowing brief line:--\"_No. 99. A stranger's head, by an unknown\nhand._\"\n\nIt seemed plain that the whole must be a collection of those wretched\nimported daubs, which with the incredible effrontery peculiar to some of\nthe foreign picture-dealers in America, were christened by the loftiest\nnames known to Art. But as the most mutilated torsoes of the perfections\nof antiquity are not unworthy the student's attention, neither are the\nmost bungling modern incompletenesses: for both are torsoes; one of\nperished perfections in the past; the other, by anticipation, of yet\nunfulfilled perfections in the future. Still, as Pierre walked along by\nthe thickly hung walls, and seemed to detect the infatuated vanity which\nmust have prompted many of these utterly unknown artists in the\nattempted execution by feeble hand of vigorous themes; he could not\nrepress the most melancholy foreboding concerning himself. All the walls\nof the world seemed thickly hung with the empty and impotent scope of\npictures, grandly outlined, but miserably filled. The smaller and\nhumbler pictures, representing little familiar things, were by far the\nbest executed; but these, though touching him not unpleasingly, in one\nrestricted sense, awoke no dormant majesties in his soul, and therefore,\nupon the whole, were contemptibly inadequate and unsatisfactory.\n\nAt last Pierre and Isabel came to that painting of which Pierre was\ncapriciously in search--No. 99.\n\n\"My God! see! see!\" cried Isabel, under strong excitement, \"only my\nmirror has ever shown me that look before! See! see!\"\n\nBy some mere hocus-pocus of chance, or subtly designing knavery, a real\nItalian gem of art had found its way into this most hybrid collection of\nimpostures.\n\nNo one who has passed through the great galleries of Europe,\nunbewildered by their wonderful multitudinousness of surpassing\nexcellence--a redundancy which neutralizes all discrimination or\nindividualizing capacity in most ordinary minds--no calm, penetrative\nperson can have victoriously run that painted gauntlet of the gods,\nwithout certain very special emotions, called forth by some one or more\nindividual paintings, to which, however, both the catalogues and the\ncriticisms of the greatest connoisseurs deny any all-transcending merit,\nat all answering to the effect thus casually produced. There is no time\nnow to show fully how this is; suffice it, that in such instances, it is\nnot the abstract excellence always, but often the accidental\ncongeniality, which occasions this wonderful emotion. Still, the\nindividual himself is apt to impute it to a different cause; hence, the\nheadlong enthusiastic admiration of some one or two men for things not\nat all praised by--or at most, which are indifferent to--the rest of the\nworld;--a matter so often considered inexplicable.\n\nBut in this Stranger's Head by the Unknown Hand, the abstract general\nexcellence united with the all-surprising, accidental congeniality in\nproducing an accumulated impression of power upon both Pierre and\nIsabel. Nor was the strangeness of this at all impaired by the apparent\nuninterestedness of Lucy concerning that very picture. Indeed,\nLucy--who, owing to the occasional jolting of the crowd, had loosened\nher arm from Pierre's, and so, gradually, had gone on along the pictured\nhall in advance--Lucy had thus passed the strange painting, without the\nleast special pause, and had now wandered round to the precisely\nopposite side of the hall; where, at this present time, she was standing\nmotionless before a very tolerable copy (the only other good thing in\nthe collection) of that sweetest, most touching, but most awful of all\nfeminine heads--The Cenci of Guido. The wonderfulness of which head\nconsists chiefly, perhaps, in a striking, suggested contrast,\nhalf-identical with, and half-analogous to, that almost supernatural\none--sometimes visible in the maidens of tropical nations--namely, soft\nand light blue eyes, with an extremely fair complexion; vailed by\nfunereally jetty hair. But with blue eyes and fair complexion, the\nCenci's hair is golden--physically, therefore, all is in strict, natural\nkeeping; which, nevertheless, still the more intensifies the suggested\nfanciful anomaly of so sweetly and seraphically _blonde_ a being, being\ndouble-hooded, as it were, by the black crape of the two most horrible\ncrimes (of one of which she is the object, and of the other the agent)\npossible to civilized humanity--incest and parricide.\n\nNow, this Cenci and \"the Stranger\" were hung at a good elevation in one\nof the upper tiers; and, from the opposite walls, exactly faced each\nother; so that in secret they seemed pantomimically talking over and\nacross the heads of the living spectators below.\n\nWith the aspect of the Cenci every one is familiar. \"The Stranger\" was a\ndark, comely, youthful man's head, portentously looking out of a dark,\nshaded ground, and ambiguously smiling. There was no discoverable\ndrapery; the dark head, with its crisp, curly, jetty hair, seemed just\ndisentangling itself from out of curtains and clouds. But to Isabel, in\nthe eye and on the brow, were certain shadowy traces of her own\nunmistakable likeness; while to Pierre, this face was in part as the\nresurrection of the one he had burnt at the Inn. Not that the separate\nfeatures were the same; but the pervading look of it, the subtler\ninterior keeping of the entirety, was almost identical; still, for all\nthis, there was an unequivocal aspect of foreignness, of Europeanism,\nabout both the face itself and the general painting.\n\n\"Is it? Is it? Can it be?\" whispered Isabel, intensely.\n\nNow, Isabel knew nothing of the painting which Pierre had destroyed. But\nshe solely referred to the living being who--under the designation of\nher father--had visited her at the cheerful house to which she had been\nremoved during childhood from the large and unnamable one by the\npleasant woman in the coach. Without doubt--though indeed she might not\nhave been at all conscious of it in her own mystic mind--she must have\nsomehow vaguely fancied, that this being had always through life worn\nthe same aspect to every body else which he had to her, for so very\nbrief an interval of his possible existence. Solely knowing him--or\ndreaming of him, it may have been--under that one aspect, she could not\nconceive of him under any other. Whether or not these considerations\ntouching Isabel's ideas occurred to Pierre at this moment is very\nimprobable. At any rate, he said nothing to her, either to deceive or\nundeceive, either to enlighten or obscure. For, indeed, he was too much\nriveted by his own far-interior emotions to analyze now the cotemporary\nones of Isabel. So that there here came to pass a not unremarkable\nthing: for though both were intensely excited by one object, yet their\ntwo minds and memories were thereby directed to entirely different\ncontemplations; while still each, for the time--however\nunreasonably--might have vaguely supposed the other occupied by one and\nthe same contemplation. Pierre was thinking of the chair-portrait:\nIsabel, of the living face. Yet Isabel's fervid exclamations having\nreference to the living face, were now, as it were, mechanically\nresponded to by Pierre, in syllables having reference to the\nchair-portrait. Nevertheless, so subtile and spontaneous was it all,\nthat neither perhaps ever afterward discovered this contradiction; for,\nevents whirled them so rapidly and peremptorily after this, that they\nhad no time for those calm retrospective reveries indispensable perhaps\nto such a discovery.\n\n\"Is it? is it? can it be?\" was the intense whisper of Isabel.\n\n\"No, it can not be, it is not,\" replied Pierre; \"one of the wonderful\ncoincidences, nothing more.\"\n\n\"Oh, by that word, Pierre, we but vainly seek to explain the\ninexplicable. Tell me: it is! it must be! it is wonderful!\"\n\n\"Let us begone; and let us keep eternal silence,\" said Pierre, quickly;\nand, seeking Lucy, they abruptly left the place; as before, Pierre,\nseemingly unwilling to be accosted by any one he knew, or who knew his\ncompanions, unconsciously accelerating their steps while forced for a\nspace to tread the thoroughfares.\n\n\nII.\n\nAs they hurried on, Pierre was silent; but wild thoughts were hurrying\nand shouting in his heart. The most tremendous displacing and\nrevolutionizing thoughts were upheaving in him, with reference to\nIsabel; nor--though at the time he was hardly conscious of such a\nthing--were these thoughts wholly unwelcome to him.\n\nHow did he know that Isabel was his sister? Setting aside Aunt\nDorothea's nebulous legend, to which, in some shadowy points, here and\nthere Isabel's still more nebulous story seemed to fit on,--though but\nuncertainly enough--and both of which thus blurredly conjoining\nnarrations, regarded in the unscrupulous light of real naked reason,\nwere any thing but legitimately conclusive; and setting aside his own\ndim reminiscences of his wandering father's death-bed; (for though, in\none point of view, those reminiscences might have afforded some degree\nof presumption as to his father's having been the parent of an\nunacknowledged daughter, yet were they entirely inconclusive as to that\npresumed daughter's identity; and the grand point now with Pierre was,\nnot the general question whether his father had had a daughter, but\nwhether, assuming that he had had, _Isabel_, rather than any other\nliving being, _was that daughter_;)--and setting aside all his own\nmanifold and inter-enfolding mystic and transcendental\npersuasions,--originally born, as he now seemed to feel, purely of an\nintense procreative enthusiasm:--an enthusiasm no longer so\nall-potential with him as of yore; setting all these aside, and coming\nto the plain, palpable facts,--how did he _know_ that Isabel was his\nsister? Nothing that he saw in her face could he remember as having seen\nin his father's. The chair-portrait, _that_ was the entire sum and\nsubstance of all possible, rakable, downright presumptive evidence,\nwhich peculiarly appealed to his own separate self. Yet here was another\nportrait of a complete stranger--a European; a portrait imported from\nacross the seas, and to be sold at public auction, which was just as\nstrong an evidence as the other. Then, the original of this second\nportrait was as much the father of Isabel as the original of the\nchair-portrait. But perhaps there was no original at all to this second\nportrait; it might have been a pure fancy piece; to which conceit,\nindeed, the uncharacterizing style of the filling-up seemed to furnish\nno small testimony.\n\nWith such bewildering meditations as these in him, running up like\nclasping waves upon the strand of the most latent secrecies of his soul,\nand with both Isabel and Lucy bodily touching his sides as he walked;\nthe feelings of Pierre were entirely untranslatable into any words that\ncan be used.\n\nOf late to Pierre, much more vividly than ever before, the whole story\nof Isabel had seemed an enigma, a mystery, an imaginative delirium;\nespecially since he had got so deep into the inventional mysteries of\nhis book. For he who is most practically and deeply conversant with\nmysticisms and mysteries; he who professionally deals in mysticisms and\nmysteries himself; often that man, more than any body else, is disposed\nto regard such things in others as very deceptively bejuggling; and\nlikewise is apt to be rather materialistic in all his own merely\npersonal notions (as in their practical lives, with priests of\nEleusinian religions), and more than any other man, is often inclined,\nat the bottom of his soul, to be uncompromisingly skeptical on all novel\nvisionary hypotheses of any kind. It is only the no-mystics, or the\nhalf-mystics, who, properly speaking, are credulous. So that in Pierre,\nwas presented the apparent anomaly of a mind, which by becoming really\nprofound in itself, grew skeptical of all tendered profundities;\nwhereas, the contrary is generally supposed.\n\nBy some strange arts Isabel's wonderful story might have been, someway,\nand for some cause, forged for her, in her childhood, and craftily\nimpressed upon her youthful mind; which so--like a slight mark in a\nyoung tree--had now enlargingly grown with her growth, till it had\nbecome this immense staring marvel. Tested by any thing real, practical,\nand reasonable, what less probable, for instance, than that fancied\ncrossing of the sea in her childhood, when upon Pierre's subsequent\nquestioning of her, she did not even know that the sea was salt.\n\n\nIII.\n\nIn the midst of all these mental confusions they arrived at the wharf;\nand selecting the most inviting of the various boats which lay about\nthem in three or four adjacent ferry-slips, and one which was bound for\na half-hour's sail across the wide beauty of that glorious bay; they\nsoon found themselves afloat and in swift gliding motion.\n\nThey stood leaning on the rail of the guard, as the sharp craft darted\nout from among the lofty pine-forests of ships'-masts, and the tangled\nunderbrush and cane-brakes of the dwarfed sticks of sloops and scows.\nSoon, the spires of stone on the land, blent with the masts of wood on\nthe water; the crotch of the twin-rivers pressed the great wedged city\nalmost out of sight. They swept by two little islets distant from the\nshore; they wholly curved away from the domes of free-stone and marble,\nand gained the great sublime dome of the bay's wide-open waters.\n\nSmall breeze had been felt in the pent city that day, but the fair\nbreeze of naked nature now blew in their faces. The waves began to\ngather and roll; and just as they gained a point, where--still\nbeyond--between high promontories of fortresses, the wide bay visibly\nsluiced into the Atlantic, Isabel convulsively grasped the arm of Pierre\nand convulsively spoke.\n\n\"I feel it! I feel it! It is! It is!\"\n\n\"What feelest thou?--what is it?\"\n\n\"The motion! the motion!\"\n\n\"Dost thou not understand, Pierre?\" said Lucy, eying with concern and\nwonder his pale, staring aspect--\"The waves: it is the motion of the\nwaves that Isabel speaks of. Look, they are rolling, direct from the sea\nnow.\"\n\nAgain Pierre lapsed into a still stranger silence and revery.\n\nIt was impossible altogether to resist the force of this striking\ncorroboration of by far the most surprising and improbable thing in the\nwhole surprising and improbable story of Isabel. Well did he remember\nher vague reminiscence of the teetering sea, that did not slope exactly\nas the floors of the unknown, abandoned, old house among the French-like\nmountains.\n\nWhile plunged in these mutually neutralizing thoughts of the strange\npicture and the last exclamations of Isabel, the boat arrived at its\ndestination--a little hamlet on the beach, not very far from the great\nblue sluice-way into the ocean, which was now yet more distinctly\nvisible than before.\n\n\"Don't let us stop here\"--cried Isabel. \"Look, let us go through there!\nBell must go through there! See! see! out there upon the blue! yonder,\nyonder! far away--out, out!--far, far away, and away, and away, out\nthere! where the two blues meet, and are nothing--Bell must go!\"\n\n\"Why, Isabel,\" murmured Lucy, \"that would be to go to far England or\nFrance; thou wouldst find but few friends in far France, Isabel.\"\n\n\"Friends in far France? And what friends have I here?--Art thou my\nfriend? In thy secret heart dost thou wish me well? And for thee,\nPierre, what am I but a vile clog to thee; dragging thee back from all\nthy felicity? Yes, I will go yonder--yonder; out there! I will, I will!\nUnhand me! Let me plunge!\"\n\nFor an instant, Lucy looked incoherently from one to the other. But both\nshe and Pierre now mechanically again seized Isabel's frantic arms, as\nthey were again thrown over the outer rail of the boat. They dragged her\nback; they spoke to her; they soothed her; but though less vehement,\nIsabel still looked deeply distrustfully at Lucy, and deeply\nreproachfully at Pierre.\n\nThey did not leave the boat as intended; too glad were they all, when it\nunloosed from its fastenings, and turned about upon the backward trip.\n\nStepping to shore, Pierre once more hurried his companions through the\nunavoidable publicity of the thoroughfares; but less rapidly proceeded,\nsoon as they gained the more secluded streets.\n\n\nIV.\n\nGaining the Apostles', and leaving his two companions to the privacy of\ntheir chambers, Pierre sat silent and intent by the stove in the\ndining-room for a time, and then was on the point of entering his closet\nfrom the corridor, when Delly, suddenly following him, said to him, that\nshe had forgotten to mention it before, but he would find two letters in\nhis room, which had been separately left at the door during the absence\nof the party.\n\nHe passed into the closet, and slowly shooting the bolt--which, for want\nof something better, happened to be an old blunted dagger--walked, with\nhis cap yet unmoved, slowly up to the table, and beheld the letters.\nThey were lying with their sealed sides up; one in either hand, he\nlifted them; and held them straight out sideways from him.\n\n\"I see not the writing; know not yet, by mine own eye, that they are\nmeant for me; yet, in these hands I feel that I now hold the final\nponiards that shall stab me; and by stabbing me, make _me_ too a most\nswift stabber in the recoil. Which point first?--this!\"\n\nHe tore open the left-hand letter:--\n\n     \"SIR:--You are a swindler. Upon the pretense of writing a popular\n     novel for us, you have been receiving cash advances from us, while\n     passing through our press the sheets of a blasphemous rhapsody,\n     filched from the vile Atheists, Lucian and Voltaire. Our great\n     press of publication has hitherto prevented our slightest\n     inspection of our reader's proofs of your book. Send not another\n     sheet to us. Our bill for printing thus far, and also for our cash\n     advances, swindled out of us by you, is now in the hands of our\n     lawyer, who is instructed to proceed with instant rigor.\n\n      (_Signed_)       STEEL, FLINT & ASBESTOS.\"\n\nHe folded the left-hand letter, and put it beneath his left heel, and\nstood upon it so; and then opened the right-hand letter.\n\n     \"Thou, Pierre Glendinning, art a villainous and perjured liar. It\n     is the sole object of this letter imprintedly to convey the point\n     blank lie to thee; that taken in at thy heart, it may be thence\n     pulsed with thy blood, throughout thy system. We have let some\n     interval pass inactive, to confirm and solidify our hate.\n     Separately, and together, we brand thee, in thy every lung-cell, a\n     liar;--liar, because that is the scornfullest and loathsomest title\n     for a man; which in itself is the compend of all infamous things.\n\n     (_Signed_)       GLENDINNING STANLY,\n                      FREDERIC TARTAN.\"\n\nHe folded the right-hand letter, and put it beneath his right heel; then\nfolding his two arms, stood upon both the letters.\n\n\"These are most small circumstances; but happening just now to me,\nbecome indices to all immensities. For now am I hate-shod! On these I\nwill skate to my acquittal! No longer do I hold terms with aught.\nWorld's bread of life, and world's breath of honor, both are snatched\nfrom me; but I defy all world's bread and breath. Here I step out before\nthe drawn-up worlds in widest space, and challenge one and all of them\nto battle! Oh, Glen! oh, Fred! most fraternally do I leap to your\nrib-crushing hugs! Oh, how I love ye two, that yet can make me lively\nhate, in a world which elsewise only merits stagnant scorn!--Now, then,\nwhere is this swindler's, this coiner's book? Here, on this vile\ncounter, over which the coiner thought to pass it to the world, here\nwill I nail it fast, for a detected cheat! And thus nailed fast now, do\nI spit upon it, and so get the start of the wise world's worst abuse of\nit! Now I go out to meet my fate, walking toward me in the street.\"\n\nAs with hat on, and Glen and Frederic's letter invisibly crumpled in his\nhand, he--as it were somnambulously--passed into the room of Isabel, she\ngave loose to a thin, long shriek, at his wondrous white and haggard\nplight; and then, without the power to stir toward him, sat petrified\nin her chair, as one embalmed and glazed with icy varnish.\n\nHe heeded her not, but passed straight on through both intervening\nrooms, and without a knock unpremeditatedly entered Lucy's chamber. He\nwould have passed out of that, also, into the corridor, without one\nword; but something stayed him.\n\nThe marble girl sat before her easel; a small box of pointed charcoal,\nand some pencils by her side; her painter's wand held out against the\nframe; the charcoal-pencil suspended in two fingers, while with the same\nhand, holding a crust of bread, she was lightly brushing the\nportrait-paper, to efface some ill-considered stroke. The floor was\nscattered with the bread-crumbs and charcoal-dust; he looked behind the\neasel, and saw his own portrait, in the skeleton.\n\nAt the first glimpse of him, Lucy started not, nor stirred; but as if\nher own wand had there enchanted her, sat tranced.\n\n\"Dead embers of departed fires lie by thee, thou pale girl; with dead\nembers thou seekest to relume the flame of all extinguished love! Waste\nnot so that bread; eat it--in bitterness!\"\n\nHe turned, and entered the corridor, and then, with outstretched arms,\npaused between the two outer doors of Isabel and Lucy.\n\n\"For ye two, my most undiluted prayer is now, that from your here unseen\nand frozen chairs ye may never stir alive;--the fool of Truth, the fool\nof Virtue, the fool of Fate, now quits ye forever!\"\n\nAs he now sped down the long winding passage, some one eagerly hailed\nhim from a stair.\n\n\"What, what, my boy? where now in such a squally hurry? Hallo, I say!\"\n\nBut without heeding him at all, Pierre drove on. Millthorpe looked\nanxiously and alarmedly after him a moment, then made a movement in\npursuit, but paused again.\n\n\"There was ever a black vein in this Glendinning; and now that vein is\nswelled, as if it were just one peg above a tourniquet drawn over-tight.\nI scarce durst dog him now; yet my heart misgives me that I\nshould.--Shall I go to his rooms and ask what black thing this is that\nhath befallen him?--No; not yet;--might be thought officious--they say\nI'm given to that. I'll wait; something may turn up soon. I'll into the\nfront street, and saunter some; and then--we'll see.\"\n\n\nV.\n\nPierre passed on to a remote quarter of the building, and abruptly\nentered the room of one of the Apostles whom he knew. There was no one\nin it. He hesitated an instant; then walked up to a book-case, with a\nchest of drawers in the lower part.\n\n\"Here I saw him put them:--this,--no--here--ay--we'll try this.\"\n\nWrenching open the locked drawer, a brace of pistols, a powder flask, a\nbullet-bag, and a round green box of percussion-caps lay before him.\n\n\"Ha! what wondrous tools Prometheus used, who knows? but more wondrous\nthese, that in an instant, can unmake the topmost\nthree-score-years-and-ten of all Prometheus' makings. Come: here's two\ntubes that'll outroar the thousand pipes of Harlem.--Is the music in\n'em?--No?--Well then, here's powder for the shrill treble; and wadding\nfor the tenor; and a lead bullet for the concluding bass!\nAnd,--and,--and,--ay; for the top-wadding, I'll send 'em back their lie,\nand plant it scorching in their brains!\"\n\nHe tore off that part of Glen and Fred's letter, which more\nparticularly gave the lie; and halving it, rammed it home upon the\nbullets.\n\nHe thrust a pistol into either breast of his coat; and taking the\nrearward passages, went down into the back street; directing his rapid\nsteps toward the grand central thoroughfare of the city.\n\nIt was a cold, but clear, quiet, and slantingly sunny day; it was\nbetween four and five of the afternoon; that hour, when the great\nglaring avenue was most thronged with haughty-rolling carriages, and\nproud-rustling promenaders, both men and women. But these last were\nmostly confined to the one wide pavement to the West; the other pavement\nwas well nigh deserted, save by porters, waiters, and parcel-carriers of\nthe shops. On the west pave, up and down, for three long miles, two\nstreams of glossy, shawled, or broadcloth life unceasingly brushed by\neach other, as long, resplendent, drooping trains of rival peacocks\nbrush.\n\nMixing with neither of these, Pierre stalked midway between. From his\nwild and fatal aspect, one way the people took the wall, the other way\nthey took the curb. Unentangledly Pierre threaded all their host, though\nin its inmost heart. Bent he was, on a straightforward, mathematical\nintent. His eyes were all about him as he went; especially he glanced\nover to the deserted pavement opposite; for that emptiness did not\ndeceive him; he himself had often walked that side, the better to scan\nthe pouring throng upon the other.\n\nJust as he gained a large, open, triangular space, built round with the\nstateliest public erections;--the very proscenium of the town;--he saw\nGlen and Fred advancing, in the distance, on the other side. He\ncontinued on; and soon he saw them crossing over to him obliquely, so as\nto take him face-and-face. He continued on; when suddenly running ahead\nof Fred, who now chafingly stood still (because Fred would not make two,\nin the direct personal assault upon one) and shouting \"Liar! Villain!\"\nGlen leaped toward Pierre from front, and with such lightning-like\nferocity, that the simultaneous blow of his cowhide smote Pierre across\nthe cheek, and left a half-livid and half-bloody brand.\n\nFor that one moment, the people fell back on all sides from them; and\nleft them--momentarily recoiled from each other--in a ring of panics.\n\nBut clapping both hands to his two breasts, Pierre, on both sides\nshaking off the sudden white grasp of two rushing girls, tore out both\npistols, and rushed headlong upon Glen.\n\n\"For thy one blow, take here two deaths! 'Tis speechless sweet to murder\nthee!\"\n\nSpatterings of his own kindred blood were upon the pavement; his own\nhand had extinguished his house in slaughtering the only unoutlawed\nhuman being by the name of Glendinning;--and Pierre was seized by a\nhundred contending hands.\n\n\nVI.\n\nThat sundown, Pierre stood solitary in a low dungeon of the city prison.\nThe cumbersome stone ceiling almost rested on his brow; so that the long\ntiers of massive cell-galleries above seemed partly piled on him. His\nimmortal, immovable, bleached cheek was dry; but the stone cheeks of the\nwalls were trickling. The pent twilight of the contracted yard, coming\nthrough the barred arrow-slit, fell in dim bars upon the granite floor.\n\n\"Here, then, is the untimely, timely end;--Life's last chapter well\nstitched into the middle! Nor book, nor author of the book, hath any\nsequel, though each hath its last lettering!--It is ambiguous still. Had\nI been heartless now, disowned, and spurningly portioned off the girl\nat Saddle Meadows, then had I been happy through a long life on earth,\nand perchance through a long eternity in heaven! Now, 'tis merely hell\nin both worlds. Well, be it hell. I will mold a trumpet of the flames,\nand, with my breath of flame, breathe back my defiance! But give me\nfirst another body! I long and long to die, to be rid of this dishonored\ncheek. _Hung by the neck till thou be dead._--Not if I forestall you,\nthough!--Oh now to live is death, and now to die is life; now, to my\nsoul, were a sword my midwife!--Hark!--the hangman?--who comes?\"\n\n\"Thy wife and cousin--so they say;--hope they may be; they may stay till\ntwelve;\" wheezingly answered a turnkey, pushing the tottering girls into\nthe cell, and locking the door upon them.\n\n\"Ye two pale ghosts, were this the other world, ye were not welcome.\nAway!--Good Angel and Bad Angel both!--For Pierre is neuter now!\"\n\n\"Oh, ye stony roofs, and seven-fold stony skies!--not thou art the\nmurderer, but thy sister hath murdered thee, my brother, oh my brother!\"\n\nAt these wailed words from Isabel, Lucy shrunk up like a scroll, and\nnoiselessly fell at the feet of Pierre.\n\nHe touched her heart.--\"Dead!--Girl! wife or sister, saint or\nfiend!\"--seizing Isabel in his grasp--\"in thy breasts, life for infants\nlodgeth not, but death-milk for thee and me!--The drug!\" and tearing her\nbosom loose, he seized the secret vial nesting there.\n\n\nVII.\n\nAt night the squat-framed, asthmatic turnkey tramped the dim-lit iron\ngallery before one of the long honey-combed rows of cells.\n\n\"Mighty still there, in that hole, them two mice I let in;--humph!\"\n\nSuddenly, at the further end of the gallery, he discerned a shadowy\nfigure emerging from the archway there, and running on before an\nofficer, and impetuously approaching where the turnkey stood.\n\n\"More relations coming. These wind-broken chaps are always in before the\nsecond death, seeing they always miss the first.--Humph! What a froth\nthe fellow's in?--Wheezes worse than me!\"\n\n\"Where is she?\" cried Fred Tartan, fiercely, to him; \"she's not at the\nmurderer's rooms! I sought the sweet girl there, instant upon the blow;\nbut the lone dumb thing I found there only wrung her speechless hands\nand pointed to the door;--both birds were flown! Where is she, turnkey?\nI've searched all lengths and breadths but this. Hath any angel swept\nadown and lighted in your granite hell?\"\n\n\"Broken his wind, and broken loose, too, aint he?\" wheezed the turnkey\nto the officer who now came up.\n\n\"This gentleman seeks a young lady, his sister, someway innocently\nconnected with the prisoner last brought in. Have any females been here\nto see him?\"\n\n\"Oh, ay,--two of 'em in there now;\" jerking his stumped thumb behind\nhim.\n\nFred darted toward the designated cell.\n\n\"Oh, easy, easy, young gentleman\"--jingling at his huge bunch of\nkeys--\"easy, easy, till I get the picks--I'm housewife here.--Hallo,\nhere comes another.\"\n\nHurrying through the same archway toward them, there now rapidly\nadvanced a second impetuous figure, running on in advance of a second\nofficer.\n\n\"Where is the cell?\" demanded Millthorpe.\n\n\"He seeks an interview with the last prisoner,\" explained the second\nofficer.\n\n\"Kill 'em both with one stone, then,\" wheezed the turnkey, gratingly\nthrowing open the door of the cell. \"There's his pretty parlor,\ngentlemen; step in. Reg'lar mouse-hole, arn't it?--Might hear a rabbit\nburrow on the world's t'other side;--are they all 'sleep?\"\n\n\"I stumble!\" cried Fred, from within; \"Lucy! A light! a light!--Lucy!\"\nAnd he wildly groped about the cell, and blindly caught Millthorpe, who\nwas also wildly groping.\n\n\"Blister me not! take off thy bloody touch!--Ho, ho, the light!--Lucy!\nLucy!--she's fainted!\"\n\nThen both stumbled again, and fell from each other in the cell: and for\na moment all seemed still, as though all breaths were held.\n\nAs the light was now thrust in, Fred was seen on the floor holding his\nsister in his arms; and Millthorpe kneeling by the side of Pierre, the\nunresponsive hand in his; while Isabel, feebly moving, reclined between,\nagainst the wall.\n\n\"Yes! Yes!--Dead! Dead! Dead!--without one visible wound--her sweet\nplumage hides it.--Thou hellish carrion, this is thy hellish work! Thy\njuggler's rifle brought down this heavenly bird! Oh, my God, my God!\nThou scalpest me with this sight!\"\n\n\"The dark vein's burst, and here's the deluge-wreck--all stranded here!\nAh, Pierre! my old companion,\nPierre;--school-mate--play-mate--friend!--Our sweet boy's walks within\nthe woods!--Oh, I would have rallied thee, and banteringly warned thee\nfrom thy too moody ways, but thou wouldst never heed! What scornful\ninnocence rests on thy lips, my friend!--Hand scorched with murderer's\npowder, yet how woman-soft!--By heaven, these fingers move!--one\nspeechless clasp!--all's o'er!\"\n\n\"All's o'er, and ye know him not!\" came gasping from the wall; and from\nthe fingers of Isabel dropped an empty vial--as it had been a run-out\nsand-glass--and shivered upon the floor; and her whole form sloped\nsideways, and she fell upon Pierre's heart, and her long hair ran over\nhim, and arbored him in ebon vines.\n\n\nFINIS.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Pierre; or The Ambiguities, by Herman Melville\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK PIERRE; OR THE AMBIGUITIES ***\n\n***** This file should be named 34970-8.txt or 34970-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/3\/4\/9\/7\/34970\/\n\nProduced by Chuck Greif and the Online Distributed\nProofreading Team at http:\/\/www.pgdp.net (This book was\nproduced from scanned images of public domain material\nfrom the Google Print project.)\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp:\/\/pglaf.org\/fundraising.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":82,"split":"train"}
