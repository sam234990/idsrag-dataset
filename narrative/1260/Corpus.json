At the outset of the novel, Col. Worth talks about the Battle of Manila of the Spanish\u00e2\u0080\u0093American War in the Philippines, especially Admiral George Dewey's damage done to the Spanish fleet. Meanwhile, his guardian and son go to a socialist meeting. Indeed, his son Norman becomes infatuated with Barbara Bozenta, a socialist figure, and hosts a socialist meeting at Col. Worth's country house near Berkeley on July 4, American Independence Day. The meeting is canceled when Norman attempts to put up the Red Flag as opposed to the American flag.\nCol. Worth buys the island of Ventura for his son Norman. Located off the coast of Santa Barbara, it is meant for Norman to establish a socialist commune there. When his socialist friends fail to work, law and order needs to be restored. However, Comrades Herman and Catherine Wolf take over as heads of the commune, and sentence Norman to work in the stables, under the threat of the lash. Productivity falls as workers know they must work nine hours a day, and thus work slowly. When Norman finds a way to find gold on the beach, the device is stolen by Wolf. Wolf's wife Catherine then leaves for Santa Barbara, deeming family life to be too capitalistic.\nEventually, Norman reaches out to his father and to the Governor of California, who liberate the island. The Red flag is replaced with the American flag.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of Comrades, by Thomas Dixon\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

I thought you were supremely happy this morning\nover the news that Dewey has smashed the Spanish fleet?\"\n\n\"And so I am, little girl,\" was the gentle reply, \"or was until my eye\nfell on this call of the Socialists for a meeting to-night to denounce\nthe war--denounce the men who are dying for the flag. Read their\nsummons.\"\n\nHe opened the crumpled sheet and pointed to its head lines:\n\n\"Down with the Stars and Stripes--up with the Red Flag of\nRevolution--the symbol of universal human brotherhood! Come and bring\nyour friends. A big surprise for all!\" The Colonel's jaws snapped\nsuddenly.\n\n\"I'd like to give them the surprise they need to-night.\"\n\n\"What?\" Elena asked.\n\n\"A serenade.\"\n\n\"A serenade?\"\n\n\"Yes, with Mauser rifles and Gatling guns. I'd mow them down as I\nwould a herd of wild beasts loose in the streets of San Francisco.\"\n\n\"Merely for a difference of opinion, Governor?\" lazily broke in a\nvoice from the depths of a heavy armchair.\n\n\"If you want to put it so, Norman, yes. Opinions, my boy, are the\nessence of life--they may lead to heaven or hell. Opinions make\ncowards or heroes, patriots or traitors, criminals or saints.\"\n\n\"But you believe in free speech?\" persisted the boy.\n\n\"Yes. And that's more than any Socialist can say. I don't deny their\nright to speak their message. What I can't understand is how the\npeople who have been hounded from the tyrant-ridden countries of the\nold world and found shelter and protection beneath our flag should\nturn thus to curse the hand that shields them.\"\n\n\"But if they propose to give you a better flag, Governor?\" drawled the\nlazy voice. \"Why not consider?\"\n\n\"Look, Elena! Did the sun ever shine on anything more beautiful? See\nit fluttering from a thousand house-tops--the proud emblem of human\nfreedom and human progress! Dewey has lifted it this morning on the\nfoulest slave-pen of the Orient--the flag that has never met defeat.\nThe one big faith in me is the belief that Almighty God inspired our\nfathers to build this Republic--the noblest dream yet conceived by the\nmind of man. Dewey has sunk a tyrant fleet and conquered an empire of\nslaves without the loss of a single man. The God of our fathers was\nwith him. We have a message for the swarming millions of the East----\"\n\n\"Pardon the interruption, Governor, but I must hold the mirror up to\nnature just a moment--your portrait sketched by the poet-laureate of\nthe English-speaking world. He speaks of the American:\n\n    \"Enslaved, illogical, elate.\n      He greets the embarrassed gods, nor fears\n    To shake the iron hand of Fate\n      Or match with Destiny for beers.\n\n    \"Lo! imperturbable he rules,\n      Unkempt, disreputable, vast--\n    And in the teeth of all the schools\n      I--I shall save him at the last!\"\n\nThe Colonel smiled.\n\n\"How do you like the picture?\"\n\n\"Not bad for an Englishman, Norman. You know we licked England\ntwice----\"\n\n\"And we kin do it again, b' gosh, can't we?\" blustered the younger man\nwith mock heroics.\n\n\"You can bet we can, my son!\" continued the Colonel, quietly. \"The\nroar of Dewey's guns are echoing round the world this morning. The\nlesson will not be lost. You will observe that even your English poet\nforesees at last our salvation.\n\n    \"'And in the teeth of all the schools\n      I--I shall save him at the last!'\"\n\n\"Even in spite of the Socialists?\" queried the boy, with a grin.\n\n\"In spite of every foe--even those within our own household. War is\nthe searchlight of history, the great revealer of national life, of\nhidden strength and unexpected weakness. I saw it in the Civil\nconflict--I've seen it in this little struggle----\"\n\n\"Then you do acknowledge it's not the greatest struggle in\nhistory--that's something to be thankful for in these days of\npatriotism,\" exclaimed Norman, rising and stretching himself before\nthe open fire while he winked mischievously at Elena.\n\n\"It's big enough, my boy, to show us the truth about our nation. Our\nold problems are no longer real. The Union our fathers dreamed has\ncome at last. We are one people--one out of many--and we can whip\nSpain before breakfast----\"\n\n\"With one hand tied behind our back!\" laughed the boy.\n\n\"Yes, and blindfolded. It will be easy. But the next serious job will\nbe to bury a half million deluded fools in this country who call\nthemselves Socialists.\"\n\nThe Colonel paused and a look of foreboding clouded his face as he\ngazed from the window of his house on Nob Hill over the city of San\nFrancisco, which he loved with a devotion second only to his\npassionate enthusiasm for the Union.\n\nElena sat watching him in silent sympathy. He was the one perfect man\nof her life dreams, the biggest, strongest, tenderest soul she had\never known. Since the day she crept into his arms a lonely little\norphan ten years old she had worshipped him as father, mother,\nguardian, lover, friend--all in one. She had accepted Norman's love\nand promised to be his wife more to please his father than from any\noverwhelming passion for the handsome, lazy young athlete. It had come\nabout as a matter of course because Colonel Worth wished it.\n\nThe Colonel turned from the window, and his eyes rested on Elena's\nupturned face.\n\n\"It will be bloody work--but we've got to do it----\"\n\nElena sprang to her feet with a start and a laugh.\n\n\"Do what, Guardie? I forgot what you were talking about.\"\n\n\"Then don't worry your pretty head about it, dear. It's a job we men\nwill look after in due time.\"\n\nHe stooped and kissed her forehead. \"By-by until to-night--I'll drop\ndown to the club and hear the latest from the front.\"\n\nWith the firm, swinging stride of a man who lives in the open the\nColonel passed through the door of the library.\n\n\"Norman, I can't realize that you two are father and son--he looks\nmore like your brother.\"\n\n\"At least my older brother----\"\n\n\"Yes, of course, but you would never take him for a man of\nforty-eight. I like the touch of gray in his hair. It means dignity,\nstrength, experience. I've always hated sap-headed youngsters.\"\n\n\"Say, Elena, for heaven's sake, who are you in love with anyhow--with\nme or the Governor?\"\n\nA smile flickered around the corners of the girl's eyes and mouth\nbefore she slowly answered:\n\n\"I sometimes think I really love you both, Norman--but there are\ntimes when I have doubts about you.\"\n\n\"Thanks. I suppose I must be duly grateful for small favours, or else\nresign myself to call you 'Mother.'\"\n\n\"Would such a fate be intolerable?\"\n\nElena drew her magnificent figure to its full height and looked into\nthe young athlete's face with laughing audacity.\n\n\"By George, Elena, if I'm honest with you, I'd have to say no. You are\ntall, stately, dignified, beautiful from the crown of your black hair\nto the tip of your dainty toe--the most stunning-looking woman I ever\nsaw. I never think of you as a girl just out of school. You always\nremind me of a glorious royal figure in some old romance of the Middle\nAges----\"\n\n\"Now I'm sure I love you, Norman--for the moment at least.\"\n\n\"Then promise to go with me on a lark to-night,\" he suddenly cried.\n\n\"A lark?\"\n\nElena's gray-blue eyes danced beneath their black lashes.\n\n\"Yes, a real lark, daring, adventurous, dangerous, audacious.\"\n\n\"What is it--what is it? Tell me quick.\"\n\nThe girl seized Norman's arm with eager, childish glee.\n\n\"Let's go to that Socialist meeting and beard the lion in his den.\"\n\nElena drew back.\n\n\"No. Guardie will be furious!\"\n\n\"Ah, who's afraid? Guardie be hanged!\"\n\n\"Go by yourself.\"\n\n\"No, you've got to go with me.\"\n\n\"I won't do it. You just want to worry your father and then hide\nbehind my skirts.\"\n\n\"You can see yourself that's the easiest way to manage it. If he has a\nfit, I can just say that your curiosity was excited and I had to go\nwith you.\"\n\n\"But it's not excited.\"\n\n\"For the purposes of the lark I tell you that it is excited. There's\ntoo much patriotism in the air. It's giving me nervous prostration. I\nwant something to brace me up. I think those fellows can give me some\ngood points to tease the Governor with.\"\n\n\"Tease the Governor! You flatter yourself, Norman. He doesn't pay any\nmore attention to your talk than he would to the bark of a six weeks'\nold puppy.\"\n\n\"That's what riles me. The Governor's so cocksure of himself. I don't\nknow how to answer him, but I know he's wrong. The fury with which he\nhates the Socialists rouses my curiosity. I've always found that the\ngood things in life are forbidden. All respectable people are\npositively forbidden to attend a Socialist--traitors'--meeting. For\nthat reason let's go.\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Ah, come on. Don't be a chump. Be a sport!\"\n\n\"I'd like the lark, but I won't hurt Guardie's feelings; so that's the\nend of it.\"\n\n\"Going to be a surprise, they say.\"\n\n\"What kind of a surprise?\"\n\n\"Going to spring a big sensation.\"\n\nElena's eyes began to dance again.\n\n\"The woman called the Scarlet Nun is going to speak, and Herman Wolf,\nthe famous 'blond beast' of Socialism, will preside. They are\nmates--affinities.\"\n\n\"Married?\"\n\n\"God knows. A hundred weird stories about them circulate in the\nunder-world.\"\n\n\"I won't go! Don't you say another word!\" Elena snapped.\n\nNorman was silent.\n\n\"Are you sure it would be perfectly safe, Norman?\" the girl softly\nasked.\n\n\"Perfectly. I know every inch of that quarter of the city--went there\na hundred times the year I was a reporter.\"\n\n\"I won't go!\"\n\n\"It's the wickedest street in town. They say it's the worst block in\nAmerica.\"\n\n\"I don't want to see it.\" Elena laughed.\n\n\"And the hall is a famous red-light dancing dive in the heart of\nHell's Half Acre.\"\n\n\"Hush! Hush! I tell you I won't--_I won't_ go! But--but if I _do_--you\npromise to hold my hand every minute, Norman?\"\n\n\"And keep my arm around your waist, if you like.\"\n\nElena's cheeks flushed and her voice quivered with excitement as she\npaused in the doorway.\n\n\"I'll be ready in twenty minutes after dinner.\"\n\n\"Bully for my chum! I'll tell the Governor we've gone for a stroll.\"\n\nAs the shadows slowly fell over the city, Norman led Elena down the\nmarble steps of his father's palatial home and paused for a moment on\nthe edge of the hill on which were perched the seats of the mighty.\nElena fumbled with a new glove.\n\n\"Are you ready to descend with me to the depths, my princess in\ndisguise?\" he gaily asked.\n\n\"Did you ever know me to flunk when I gave my word?\"\n\n\"No, you're a brick, Elena.\"\n\nNorman seized her arm and strode down the steep hillside with sure,\nfirm step, the girl accompanying his every movement with responsive\njoy.\n\n\"You're awfully wicked to get me into a scrape of this kind, Norman,\"\nshe cried, with bantering laughter. \"You know I was dying to go\nslumming, and Guardie wouldn't let me. It's awfully mean of you to\ntake advantage of me like this.\"\n\nHe stopped suddenly and looked gravely into her flushed face.\n\n\"Let's go back, then.\"\n\n\"No! I won't.\"\n\nNorman broke into a laugh. \"Then away with vain regrets! And remember\nthe fate of Lot's wife.\"\n\nElena pressed his hand close to her side and whispered:\n\n\"You are with me. The big handsome captain of last year's football\nteam. Very young and very vain and very foolish and very lazy--but I\ndo think you'd stand by me in a scrap, Norman. Wouldn't you?\"\n\n\"Well, I rather think!\" was the deep answer, half whispered, as they\nsuddenly turned a corner and plunged into the red-light district. His\nstrong hand gripped her wrist with unusual tenderness.\n\n\"So who's afraid?\" she cried, looking up into his face just as a\ndrunken blear-eyed woman staggered through an open door and lurched\nagainst her.\n\nA low scream of terror came from Elena as she sprang back, and the\nwoman's head struck the pavement with a dull whack. Norman bent over\nher and started to lift the heavy figure, when her fist suddenly shot\ninto his face.\n\n\"Go ter hell--I can take care o' myself!\"\n\n\"Evidently,\" he laughed.\n\nElena's hand suddenly gripped his.\n\n\"Let's go back, Norman.\"\n\n\"Nonsense--who's afraid?\"\n\n\"I am. I don't mind saying it. This is more than I bargained for.\"\n\nThe woman scrambled to her feet and limped back into the doorway.\n\nElena shivered. \"I didn't know such women lived on this earth.\"\n\n\"To say nothing of living but a stone's throw from your own door,\" he\ncontinued.\n\n\"Let's go back,\" she pleaded.\n\n\"No. A thing like this is merely one more reason why we should keep\non. This only shows that the world we live in isn't quite perfect, as\nthe Governor seems to think. These Socialists may be right after all.\nNow that we've started let's hear their side of it. Come on! Don't be\na quitter!\"\n\nNorman seized her arm and hurried through the swiftly moving throng of\nthe under-world--gambling touts, thieves, cut-throats, pick-pockets,\nopium fiends, drunkards, thugs, carousing miners, and sailors--but\nabove all, everywhere, omnipresent, the abandoned woman--painted,\nbedizened, lurching through the streets, hanging in doorways, clinging\nto men on the sidewalks, beckoning from windows, singing vulgar songs\non crude platforms among throngs of half-drunken men, whirling past\ndoors and windows in dance-halls, their cracked voices shrill and\nrasping above the din of cheap music.\n\nElena stopped suddenly and clung heavily to Norman's arm.\n\n\"Please, Norman, let's go back. I can't endure this.\"\n\n\"And you're my chum that never flunked when she gave her word?\" he\nasked with scorn. \"We are only a few feet from the hall now.\"\n\n\"Where is it?\"\n\n\"Right there in the middle of the block where you see that sign with\nthe blazing red torch.\"\n\n\"Come on, then,\" Elena said, with a shudder.\n\nThey walked quickly through the long, dimly lighted passage to the\nentrance of the hall. It was densely packed with a crowd of five\nhundred. Elena closed her eyes and allowed Norman to lead her through\nthe mob that blocked the space inside the door. At the entrance to the\ncentre aisle he encountered an usher who stared with bulging eyes at\nhis towering figure. Norman leaned close and whispered:\n\n\"My boy, can you possibly get us two seats?\"\n\n\"Can I git de captain er de football team two seats? Well, des watch\nme!\"\n\nThe boy darted up the aisle, dived under the platform, drew out two\nfolding-chairs, placed them in the aisle on the front row, darted\nback, and bowed with grave courtesy.\n\n\"Dis way, sir!\"\n\nNorman followed with Elena clinging timidly and blindly to his arm. In\na moment they were seated. He offered the boy a dollar.\n\nThe youngster bowed again.\n\n\"De honour is all mine, sir. But you can give it to the Cause when\nthey pass the box.\"\n\nNorman turned to Elena. \"Well, doesn't that jar you? A\nsixteen-year-old boy declines a tip, and says give it to the Cause!\"\n\nThe boy darted up the steps of the platform and whispered to the\nchairman:\n\n\"Git on to his curves! Dat's de captain o' de football--de bloke dat's\nworth millions, an' don't give a doggone!\"\n\nA woman dressed in deep red who sat beside the chairman leaned close\nand asked with quiet intensity:\n\n\"You mean young Worth, the millionaire of Nob Hill?\"\n\n\"Bet yer life! Dat's him!\"\n\nThe woman in red whispered to the chairman, who nodded, while his keen\ngray eyes flashed a ray of light from his heavy brows as he turned\ntoward Norman.\n\nThe woman wheeled suddenly in her chair, and with her back to the\naudience bent over a girl who was evidently hiding behind her.\n\n\"Outdo yourself to-night, Barbara. Young Norman Worth, the son of our\nmulti-millionaire nabob, is sitting in the aisle just in front of you.\nWin him for the Cause and I'll give you the half of our kingdom.\"\n\n\"How can I know him?\" the girl asked excitedly.\n\n\"He's not ten feet from the platform in the centre aisle--front\nrow--clean shaven--a young giant of twenty-three--the handsomest man\nin the house. Put your soul _and_ your body in every word you utter,\nevery breath you breathe--and _win_ him!\"\n\n\"I'll try,\" was the low reply.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nA NEW JOAN OF ARC\n\n\nThe woman in scarlet rose, lifted her hand, and the crowd sprang to\ntheir feet to the music of the most stirring song of revolution ever\nwritten.\n\nNorman and Elena were both swept from their seats in spite of\nthemselves. Elena's eyes flashed with excitement.\n\n\"What on earth is that they are singing, Norman?\" she whispered.\n\n\"The Marseillaise hymn.\"\n\n\"Isn't it thrilling?\" she gasped.\n\n\"It makes your heart leap, doesn't it?\"\n\n\"And, heavens, how they sing it!\" she exclaimed.\n\nNorman turned and looked over the crowd of eager faces--every man and\nwoman singing with the passionate enthusiasm of religious fanatics--an\nenthusiasm electric, contagious, overwhelming. In spite of himself he\nfelt his heart beat with quickened sympathy.\n\nHe was amazed at the character of the audience. He had expected to see\na throng of low-browed brutes. The first shock he received was the\nfeeling that this crowd was distinctly an intellectual one. They might\nbe fanatics. They certainly were not fools. The stamp of personality\nwas clean cut on almost every face. They were fighters. They meant\nbusiness and they didn't care who knew it. Some of them wore dirty\nclothes, but their faces were stamped with the power of free,\nrebellious thought--a power that always commands respect in spite of\nshabby clothes. He looked in vain for a single joyous face. Not a\nsmile. Deep, dark eyes, shining with the light of purpose, mouths\nfirm, headstrong, merciless, and bitter, but nowhere the glimmer of a\nray of sunlight! He felt with a sense of awe the uncanny presence of\nTragedy.\n\nAnd to his amazement he noticed a lot of men he knew in the\ncrowd--three or four authors, a newspaper reporter evidently off duty,\ntwo college professors, a clergyman, three artists, a priest, and a\nstreet preacher.\n\nThe hymn died away into a low sigh, like the sob of the wind after a\nstorm. The crowd sank to their seats so quietly with the dying of the\nmusic that Norman and Elena were standing alone for an instant. They\nawoke from the spell, and dropped into their seats with evident\nembarrassment.\n\nA boy of sixteen stepped briskly to the front in answer to a nod from\nthe chairman, and recited a Socialist poem. After the first stanza,\nwhich was crude and stilted, Norman's eye rested on the heavy figure\nof the chairman. He was surprised at the power of his rugged face.\nThrough its brute strength flashed the keenest sense of alert\nintelligence--an intelligence which seemed to lurk behind the big,\nshaggy eyebrows as if about to spring on its victim. His heavy-set\nface was covered with a thick, reddish blond beard and his short hair\nstood up straight on his head, like the bristles of a wild boar. Of\nmedium height and heavy build, with arms and legs of extraordinary\nmuscle and big, coarse short fingers evidently gnarled and knotted, by\nthe coarsest labor in youth, he looked like a blacksmith who had taken\na college course by the light of his forge at night. There was\nsomething about the way he sat crouching low in his seat, watching\nwith his keen gray eyes everything that passed, that bespoke the man\nof reserve power--the man who was quietly waiting his hour.\n\n\"By George, a pretty good pet name they've given him--'The Blond\nBeast,'\" Norman muttered. \"I shouldn't like to tackle him in the\ndark.\"\n\nThe woman in red leaned toward the chairman and said something in low\ntones. He nodded his massive head, smiled, and looked back over his\nshoulder at the girl sitting behind them. The movement showed for the\nfirst time a long ugly scar on the side of his great neck.\n\n\"Look at that fellow's neck!\" whispered Elena.\n\n\"Yes. He had a close call that time,\" Norman answered. \"But I'll bet\nthe other one never lived to tell the story----\"\n\n\"Sh! 'The Scarlet Nun' is going to speak.\"\n\nThe woman in red rose and walked to the edge of the platform. She\nstood silent for a moment, her tall, graceful, willowy figure erect\nand tense. The crowd burst into a tumult of applause. She smiled,\nbowed, and lifted her slender hand with a quick, imperious gesture for\nsilence.\n\nNorman was struck by the note of religious fervour which her whole\npersonality seemed to radiate. The peculiar scarlet robe she wore\naccented this impression perhaps, and its strangeness added a touch of\nawe. The dress gave one the impression of a nun's garb except that its\nlong folds were so arranged that they revealed rather than concealed\nthe beautiful lines of her graceful figure. The colour was the deep,\nwarm red of the Socialist flag--the colour of human blood, chosen as\nthe symbol of the universal brotherhood of man. The effect of a nun's\ncowl was given by a thin scarlet mantilla thrown over the head, the\nsilken meshes of its long fringe mingling with the waves of her thick\nblack hair. Her face was that of a madonna of the slender type,\nexcept that the lips were too full, round, and sensuous and her long\neyelashes drooped slightly over dark, lustrous eyes.\n\n\"Comrades,\" she began, in slow, measured tones, \"after to-night I\nretire from the platform to take up work for which I am better fitted.\nI promised you a big surprise this evening, and you shall not be\ndisappointed----\"\n\nA murmur rippled the audience and she paused, smiling into Norman's\nface with a curious look. She spoke with a decided foreign accent with\nlittle moments of coquettish hesitation as though feeling for words.\nNorman felt an almost irresistible impulse to help her.\n\n\"I am going to in-tro-duce to you to-night,\" she continued, \"a new\nleader, whose tongue the God of the poor and the outcast and the\ndis-in-herited has touched with divine fire. She is no stran-ger.\nTwenty years ago she was born beneath the bright skies of\nCal-i-for-nia at Anaheim, in the little Socialist colony of Polish\ndreamers led by Madame Modjeska, Count Bozenta, and Henry Sienkiewicz,\nthe distin-guished author of 'Quo Vadis.' As you know, the colony\nfailed. Her mother died in poverty and she was placed in an orphan\nasylum until eight years of age, when she was taken back to Poland by\nher foolish kins-men. Four years later I found her, a ragged,\nhomeless waif, in the streets of Warsaw, alone and star-ving. Since\nthen she has been mine. Amid the squalor and misery of the old world\nher busy little tongue never tired telling of the glories of\nCali-for-nia! Always she sighed for its groves of oranges and olives,\nits dazzling flowers, its luscious grapes, its rich valleys, its\ncloud-kissed, snow-clad mountains and the mur-mur of its mighty seas!\nIt was her tiny hand that led me across the ocean to you. I have sent\nher to school in one of your Western colleges where a great Socialist\nprofessor has taught her history and e-con-omics. I have the high\nhonour, comrades, of intro-ducing to you the child of genius who from\nto-night will be the Joan of Arc of our Cause, Comrade Barbara\nBozenta!\"\n\nShe quickly turned and drew forward a trembling slip of a girl whose\nbig brown eyes were swimming in tears of excitement. A moment of\nintense silence, and the crowd burst into cheers as the dazzling\nbeauty of their new champion slowly dawned on their understanding. The\nwoman in red resumed her seat, and the girl stood bowing, trembling,\nand smiling.\n\nThe young athlete watched her keenly. Never had he seen such a bundle\nof quivering, pulsing, nervous, ravishing beauty. He could have sworn\nhe saw electric sparks flash from the tips of every eyelash, from\nevery strand of the mass of brown curls that circled her face and fell\nin rich profusion on her shoulders and across her heaving bosom. He\nfelt before she had uttered a word--felt, rather than saw--the\nremarkable effectiveness of the simple, girlish dress which enhanced\nher dark beauty. She wore the same deep red as the older woman, but\nthe bottom of the skirt was relieved by a row of ruffles edged with\nwhite lace. A scarf of white embroidered at the ends with scarlet\nflowers, was thrown gracefully around her shoulders and hung below the\nknees. Her round young arms were bare to the elbows, her throat and\nneck bare to the upper edge of the full bust.\n\nThe girl's eyes sought Norman's for an imperceptible instant and a\nsmile flashed from her trembling lips. The cheering ceased and she\nbegan to speak. He watched her with breathless intensity, and listened\nwith steadily increasing fascination. Her voice at first was low, yet\nevery word fell clear and distinct. Never had he heard a voice so\ntender and full of expressive feeling--soft and mellow, sweet like the\nnotes of a flute. There was something in its tone quality that\ncompelled sympathy, that stole into the inner depths of the soul of\nthe listener, and led reason a willing captive.\n\nIn simple yet burning words she told of the darkness and poverty, the\ncrime and shame, hunger and cruelty of the old world in which she had\nspent four years of her childhood. And then in a flight of poetic\neloquence, came the story of her dreams of California, the Golden\nWest, the land of eternal sunshine and flowers. And then, in a voice\nquivering and choking with emotion, she drew the picture of what she\nfound--of Hell's Half Acre, in which she stood, with its brazen vice,\nits crime, its hopeless misery, its want and despair. With bold and\nfierce invective she charged modern civilization with this infamy.\n\n\"Why do strong men go forth to war?\" she cried, looking into the\ndepths of Norman's soul. \"Here is the enemy at your door, gripping the\nsoft, white throats of your girls. Watch them sink into the mire at\nyour feet and then down, down into the black sewers of the under-world\nnever to rise again! I, too, call for volunteers. For heroes and\nheroines--not to fight another--I call you to a nobler warfare. I call\nyou to the salvation of a world. Will you come? I offer you stones for\nbread, the sky for your canopy, the earth for your bed, and for your\nwages death! None may enter but the brave. Will you come----?\"\n\nThe last words of her appeal rang through Norman's heart with\nresistless power. Her round, soft arms seemed about his neck and his\nsoul went out to her in passionate yearning. He gripped the chair to\nhold himself back from shouting:\n\n\"Yes! I'm coming!\"\n\nShe sank to her seat before the crowd realized that she had stopped. A\nshout of triumph shook the building--wave after wave, rising and\nfalling in ever-increasing intensity. At its height the Scarlet Nun\nsprang to her feet, with a graceful leap reached the edge of the\nplatform, and again lifted her hand. A sudden hush fell on the crowd.\n\n\"Now, comrades, the battle-hymn of the Republic set to new music! Mark\nits words, and remember that we sing it not as a mem-ory, but as a\nproph-esy of the day our streets may run red with the blood of the\nlast struggle of Man to break his chains of Slav-ery--a proph-esy,\nremember, not a mem-ory! Read it Barbara!\"\n\nThe girl was by her side in an instant, and read from memory, her\nclear sweet voice tremulous with passion:\n\n  \"Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord;\n  He is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored;\n  He has loosed the fateful lightning of his terrible swift sword:\n  His truth is marching on!\n\n  I have seen Him in the watch-fires of a hundred circling camps;\n  They have builded Him an altar in the evening's dews and damps;\n  I can read His righteous sentence by the dim and flaring lamps:\n  His day is marching on!\n\n  He has sounded forth the trumpet that shall never call retreat;\n  He is sifting out the hearts of men before His judgment seat;\n  Oh! be swift, my soul, to answer them, be jubilant my feet!\n  Our God is marching on!\"\n\nThe crowd burst again into triumphant song, and Norman looked at their\nfaces with increasing amazement. The immense vitality of their faith,\nthe rush of its forward movement, the grandeur and audacity of their\nprogramme struck him as a revelation. They proposed no half-way\nmeasures. They meant to uproot the foundations of modern society and\nbuild a new world on its ruins. Their leaders were fanatics--yes. But\nfanatics were the only kind of people who would dare such things and do\nthem. Here was a movement, which at least meant something--something\nbig, heroic, daring. His face suddenly flushed and his heart leaped\nwith an impulse.\n\n\"In heaven's name, Norman, what's the matter?\" Elena asked.\n\nThe young poet-athlete looked at her in a dazed sort of way and\nstammered:\n\n\"Did you ever see anything like it?\"\n\n\"No, and I don't want to again,\" she replied with a frown. \"Let's go\nhome.\"\n\n\"Wait, they are taking up a collection. At least we must pay for our\nseats.\"\n\nWhen the usher passed he emptied the contents of his pocket in the\ncollection-box.\n\nAs the meeting broke up, the boy who placed their seats touched Norman\non the arm.\n\n\"Let me introduce ye to her. I wants ter tell 'er ye er my\nfriend--I've yelled my head off for ye many a day on de football\nground. Jest er minute. I'll fetch 'er right down.\"\n\nThe boy darted up on the platform, and Norman turned to Elena:\n\n\"Shall we please the boy?\"\n\n\"You mean yourself,\" she replied. \"I decline the honour.\"\n\nShe turned away into the crowd as the boy returned leading Barbara.\n\nNorman hastened to meet them at the foot of the platform steps.\n\n\"Dis is me friend, Worth, de captain of de football team, Miss\nBarbara,\" proudly exclaimed the boy.\n\nBarbara extended her soft hand with a warm, friendly smile, and\nNorman clasped it while his heart throbbed.\n\n\"I congratulate you,\" he said, \"on your wonderful triumph to-night.\"\n\n\"You were interested?\" she asked, quietly.\n\n\"More than I can tell you,\" was the quick response.\n\n\"Then join our club and help me in my work among the poor,\" she urged,\nwith frank eagerness. \"We meet to-morrow afternoon at three o'clock.\nWon't you come?\"\n\nA long, deep look into her brown eyes--his face flushed and his heart\nleaped with sudden resolution.\n\n\"Thank you, I will,\" he slowly answered.\n\nHe joined Elena at the door and they walked home in brooding silence.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nTHE BIRTH OF A MAN\n\n\nNorman stood silent and thoughtful before the fire in the dining-room,\nthe morning after the meeting of the Socialists. His sleep had been\nfeverish and a hundred half-formed dreams had haunted the moments in\nwhich he had lost consciousness with always the shining face of\nBarbara smiling and beckoning him on.\n\nElena silently entered and watched him a moment before he saw her.\n\n\"Still dreaming of the New Joan of Arc, Norman?\" she asked with\nplayful banter.\n\n\"I'm going to do it, Elena,\" he said, with slow, thoughtful emphasis.\n\n\"What? Marry her without even giving me the usual two weeks' notice?\"\nElena laughed.\n\n\"Now, isn't that like a woman! I wasn't even thinking of the girl----\"\n\n\"Of course not.\"\n\nNorman laughed. \"By Jove, you're jealous at last, Elena.\"\n\n\"You flatter yourself.\"\n\n\"Honestly, I wasn't thinking of the girl----\"\n\n\"Well, I've been thinking of her. She haunts me. I like her and I hate\nher. I feel that she's charming and vicious, of the spirit and flesh,\nand yet I can't help believing that she's good. The woman who\nintroduced her is a she-devil, and the man who presided over that\nmeeting is a brute. It's a pity she's mixed up with them. What are you\ngoing to do--play the hero and rescue her from their clutches?\"\n\n\"Nonsense. The girl is nothing to me, except as the symbol of a great\nidea. It stirs my blood. I'm going to join the Socialist Club.\"\n\n\"Of which the fair Barbara is secretary.\"\n\n\"Come with me, and join too. We'll go together to every meeting.\"\n\n\"Have you gone mad?\" Elena asked, with deep seriousness.\n\n\"I'm in dead earnest.\"\n\n\"And you think your father will stand for it?\"\n\n\"That remains to be seen. I'm going to tackle him as soon as he comes\ndown to breakfast.\"\n\n\"Well, if I never see you again, good-bye, old pal.\" She extended her\nhand in mock gravity.\n\n\"I'm not afraid of him.\"\n\n\"No, of course not!\"\n\n\"You're a coward, or you'd stand by me. Wait, Elena, he's coming now.\"\n\n\"Why stand by? You're not afraid? I'll return in time for the\ninquest. Brace up! Remember Barbara. Be a hero!\"\n\nWith a ripple of laughter she disappeared as the Colonel's footsteps\nwere heard at the door.\n\nNorman braced himself for the ordeal. He had never before dared to\ntest his father's iron will. He had grown accustomed to see strong men\nbow and cringe before him, and felt a secret contempt for them all.\nThey were bowing to his millions. And yet the boy knew with intuitive\ncertainty that beneath the mask of quiet dignity and polished military\nbearing of the man he facetiously called \"the Governor\" there\nslumbered a will unique, powerful, and overbearing. More than once he\nhad resented the silent pressure of his positive and aggressive\npersonality. His own budding manhood had begun instinctively to\nbristle at its approach.\n\nThe Colonel started on seeing Norman, and looked at him with a\nquizzical expression.\n\n\"Was there an earthquake this morning, Norman?\"\n\n\"I didn't feel it, sir--why?\"\n\n\"You're downstairs rather early.\"\n\nNorman smiled. \"I've been a little lazy, I'm afraid, Governor. But you\nknow I wasn't consulted as to whether I wished to be born. You assumed\na fearful responsibility. You see the results.\"\n\nThe Colonel dropped his paper and looked at Norman a moment.\n\n\"Well, upon my word!\" he exclaimed. \"What's happened?\"\n\n\"The biggest thing that ever came into my life, Governor,\" was the\nlow, serious answer.\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"The decision that hereafter I'd rather be than seem to be, that I'm\ngoing to do some thinking for myself.\"\n\n\"And what brought you to this decision?\" the father quietly asked.\n\n\"I went last night to that Socialist meeting.\"\n\n\"Indeed!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" he went on, impetuously, \"and I heard the most wonderful appeal\nto which I ever listened--an appeal which stirred me to the deepest\ndepths of my being. I think it's the biggest movement of the century.\nI'm going to study it. I'm going to see what it means. What do you say\nto it?\"\n\nThe boy lifted his tall figure with instinctive dignity, and his eyes\nmet his father's in a straight, deep man's gaze.\n\nThe faintest smile played about the corners of the Colonel's mouth as\nhe suddenly extended his hand.\n\n\"I congratulate you!\"\n\n\"Congratulate me?\" Norman stammered.\n\n\"Upon the attainment of your majority. Up to date you have written a\nfew verses and played football. But this is the first evidence you\nhave ever shown of conscious personality. You're in the grub-worm\nstage as yet, but you're on the move. You're a human being. You have\ndeveloped the germ of character. And that's the only thing in this\nworld that's worth the candle, my boy. It's funny to hear you say that\nthe appeal of Socialism has worked this miracle. For character is the\none thing the scheme of Socialism leaves out of account. A character\nis the one thing a machine-made society could never produce if given a\nmillion years in which to develop the experiment.\"\n\n\"And you don't object?\" Norman asked with increasing amazement.\n\n\"Certainly not. Study Socialism to your heart's content. Go to the\nbottom of it. Don't slop over it. Don't accept sentimental mush for\nfacts. Find out for yourself. Read, think, and learn to know your\nfellow man. When you've picked up a few first principles, and know\nenough to talk intelligently, I've something to say to you--something\nI've learned for myself.\"\n\nThe boy looked at his father steadily and spoke with a slight tremor\nin his voice.\n\n\"Governor, you're a bigger man than I thought you were. I like\nyou--even if you are my father.\"\n\n\"Thanks, my boy,\" the Colonel gravely replied, \"I trust we may know\neach other still better in the future.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nAMONG THE SHADOWS\n\n\nUnder the tutelage of Barbara, the young millionaire plunged into the\nstudy of Socialism with the zeal of the fresh convert to a holy\ncrusade.\n\nAt first he had listened to her stories of the sufferings of the poor\nand the unemployed with mild incredulity. She laid her warm little\nhand on his and said:\n\n\"Come and see. If you think that Socialism is a dream, I'll show you\nthat capitalism is a nightmare.\"\n\nHe followed her down the ugly pavements of a squalid street into the\npoorest quarter of the city. She entered a dingy hall and pushed her\nway through a swarm of filthy children to the rear room. On a bed of\nrags lay the body of a suicide--a working-man who had shot himself the\nday before. The wife sat crouching on a broken chair, with eyes\nstaring out of the window at the sunlit skies of a May morning in\nCalifornia. Her body seemed to have turned to stone and her eyes to\nhave frozen in their sockets. Her hands lay limp in her lap, her\nshoulders drooped, her mouth hung hopelessly open. She was as dead to\nevery sight and sound of earth as though shrouded and buried in six\nfeet of clay instead of sunlight.\n\nBarbara touched her shoulder, but she did not move.\n\n\"Have you been sitting there all night, Mrs. Nelson?\" she asked,\ngently.\n\nThe woman turned her weak eyes toward the speaker and stared without\nreply.\n\n\"You haven't tasted the food I brought you,\" Barbara continued.\n\nThe drooping figure stirred with sudden energy, as if the realization\nof the question first asked had begun to stir her intelligence.\n\n\"Yes. I set up all night with Jim. He'd a-done as much fer me. There's\nnobody else that cared enough to come. Ye know it ain't respectful to\nleave your dead alone----\"\n\n\"But you must eat something,\" Barbara urged.\n\n\"I can't eat--it chokes me.\" She paused a moment, and looked at Norman\nin a dazed sort of way. \"I tried to eat and something choked me--what\nwas it? O God, I remember now!\" she cried, with strangling emotion.\n\"They are going to bury him in the potter's field unless we can save\nhim, and I know we can't. He's got an old mother way back East that\nthinks he's doing well out here. Hit'll kill her dead when she finds\nout he wuz buried by the city.\"\n\n\"He shan't go to the potter's field,\" Norman interrupted, looking out\nof the window.\n\nThe woman rose, and tried to speak, but sank sobbing:\n\n\"Thank God! Thank God! Thank God!\"\n\nWhen the first flood of grateful emotion had spent itself, she looked\nup at Norman and said:\n\n\"You see, sir, he wasn't strong, and kept losin' his job in Chicago.\nWe'd heard about California all our lives. We sold out everything and\ngot enough to come. For two years we've made a hard fight, but it was\nno use. Jim couldn't git work. I tried and I couldn't. Folks have\nhelped us, but he was proud. He wouldn't beg and he wouldn't let me.\nHe wouldn't sell his gun. I think he always meant to use it that way\nwhen he got to the end, and it come yesterday when they give us notice\nto git out.\"\n\nShe staggered over to the bed and fell across the body, sobbing:\n\n\"My poor old boy. He loved me. He was always good to me. I tried to go\nwith him. But I couldn't pull the trigger! I was afraid! I was\nafraid!\"\n\nWhen they reached the street, Barbara lifted her brown eyes to\nNorman's face and asked:\n\n\"What do you think of a social system that drives thousands of men to\nkill themselves like that?\"\n\n\"To tell you the truth I never thought of it at all before.\"\n\n\"He would have been buried in a pauper's grave but for your help. I\nbrought you here this morning because I knew you would save her that\nanguish when you understood.\"\n\n\"You knew I would?\" he softly asked.\n\n\"I wouldn't have let you come with me if I hadn't known it,\" she\nanswered, earnestly.\n\n\"It's funny how many of us live in this world without knowing anything\nabout it,\" he said, musingly.\n\n\"It would be funny were it not a tragedy,\" she answered, turning\nacross the street to the next block. They paused at the entrance of\nanother narrow hallway.\n\n\"My work as secretary of the club includes, as you see, a wide range\nof calls. I'm a dispenser of alms, the pastor of a great parish, the\nfriend, adviser, and champion of a lost world, and you have no idea\nwhat a big world it is.\"\n\n\"I'm beginning to understand. What's the trouble here? Another\nsuicide?\"\n\n\"No--something worse, I think. A man who was afraid to die and took to\ndrink. That's the way with most of them. None but the brave can look\ninto the face of Death. This man is good to his family until he's\ndrunk. Drink is the only thing that makes life worth the candle to\nhim. But when he's under the influence of liquor he's a fiend. Last\nnight he beat his wife into insensibility. This morning he sent one of\nthe children for me.\"\n\nThey climbed two flights of rickety stairs and entered a room littered\nwith broken furniture. Every chair was smashed, the table lay in\nsplinters, pieces of crockery scattered everywhere, and the stove\nbroken into fragments. Two blear-eyed children with the look of hunted\nrabbits crouched in a corner. A man was bending over the bed, where\nthe form of a woman lay still and white.\n\n\"For God's sake, brace up, Mary!\" he was saying. \"Ye mustn't die! Ye\nmustn't, I tell ye! Your white face will haunt me and drive me into\nhell a raving maniac. I didn't know what I was doin', old gal. I was\ncrazy. I wouldn't 'a' hurt a hair of your head if I'd 'a' knowed what\nI was doin'!\"\n\nHe bowed his face in his coarse, bloated hands and sobbed.\n\nThe thin white hand of the wife stroked his hair feebly.\n\n\"It's all right, Sam. I know ye didn't mean it,\" she sighed.\n\nNorman sent for a doctor, and left some money.\n\nWith each new glimpse of the under-world of pain and despair the\nconviction grew in Norman's mind that he had not lived, and the\ndetermination deepened that he would get acquainted with his fellow\nmen and the place he called his home.\n\n\"You are not tired?\" Barbara asked, as they hurried into the street.\n\n\"No, I'm just beginning to live,\" he answered, soberly.\n\n\"Good. Then you shall be allowed the honour of accompanying me to the\ncounty jail, to the poorhouse, to the hospital, and to the morgue--the\nfour greatest institutions of modern civilization. We must hurry. I've\nanother sadder visit after these.\"\n\nAs they hurried through the streets, Norman began to study with\nincreasing intensity the phenomena presented in the development of\nBarbara's character. The more he saw of her, the more he realized the\nlofty ideals of her life, the more puerile and contemptible his own\npast seemed.\n\nAt the jail they found a boy who had been convicted of stealing and\nsentenced to the penitentiary. His old mother was ill. Barbara bore\nher last message of love.\n\nThey stopped at the poorhouse to see a curious old pauper who had\nbecome a regular attendant on the Socialists' meetings. He was called\n\"Methodist John,\" because he was forever shouting \"Glory, Hallelujah!\"\nand interrupting the speakers. Barbara was the bearer of a painful\nmessage to John. Wolf had instructed her to keep him out of the\nmeetings. She had decided to try a gentler way--to warn him against\nyelling \"Glory\" again under penalty of being deprived of a dish of\nsoup of which he was particularly fond. The Socialist Club served this\nsimple, wholesome meal to all who asked for it after its weekly\nmeetings.\n\nJohn promised Barbara faithfully to stop shouting.\n\n\"Remember, John,\" she warned him finally, \"shout--no soup! No\nshout--soup!\"\n\n\"I understand, Miss Barbara,\" he answered, solemnly.\n\n\"You see, sir,\" he said, apologetically, turning to Norman, \"I get\nalong all right till she begins ter speak, and when I hears her soft,\nsweet voice it seems ter run all down my back in little ticklin' waves\nclean down ter my toes, an' I holler 'Glory' before I can stop it!\"\n\nNorman laughed.\n\n\"I understand, old man.\"\n\n\"You feel that way yerself, don't ye, now, when she looks down into\nyer soul with them big, soft eyes o' hern, an' her voice comes\na-stealin' inter yer heart like the music of the angels----\"\n\nBarbara's face lighted, and a slight blush suffused her cheeks as she\ncaught the look of admiring assent in Norman's expression.\n\n\"That will do, John,\" she said, firmly. \"Mr. Wolf was very angry with\nyou yesterday.\"\n\n\"I'll remember, Miss Barbara,\" he repeated. \"And God bless your dear\nheart fer comin' by ter tell me.\"\n\n\"I suppose he has no people living who are interested in him?\" Norman\nasked, as they turned toward the Socialist hall.\n\n\"No. He came from a big mill town in the East. His children all died\nbefore they were grown, and he landed here with his wife ten years\nago. When she died, he was sent to the poorhouse. He hasn't much mind,\nbut there's enough left to burst into flame at the memory of his\nchildren being slowly ground to death by the wheels of those mills.\nI've seen his dead soul start to life more than once as I've looked\ninto his face from our platform. What an awful thing to see dead men\nwalking about!\"\n\n\"Yes. People who are dead and don't know it. I never thought of it\nbefore.\" Norman exclaimed.\n\nThey stopped in front of a house with a scarlet light in the hall,\nwhich threw its rays through a red-glass transom over a door of\ncoloured leaded glass. The shadows of evening had begun to fall, and\nfor the first time the girl showed a sign of hesitation and\nembarrassment.\n\n\"I hate to ask you to go in here with me, and I'd hate worse to have\nyou see me go alone. Yet I have to do it. My work leads me.\"\n\n\"I'm going with you, whether you ask it or not,\" he firmly replied.\n\n\"Then words are useless,\" she said, simply, as she rang the bell.\n\nA Negro maid opened the door, and smiled a look of recognition. \"She\nain't no better, miss. She's been crying for you all day.\"\n\nBarbara led the way up two flights of stairs to a small room in the\nrear, and entered without knocking. With a bound she was beside the\nbed on which lay a slender girl of nineteen. A mass of golden blond\nhair was piled in confusion on the pillow, and a pair of big,\nchildish-looking blue eyes blinked at her through her tears.\n\n\"Oh! you've come at last! I'm so glad. It makes me strong to see you.\nYour face shines so, Barbara! They say I can't live, but it's not so.\nI shall live! I'm feeling better every day. It's nonsense. The doctors\nhaven't got any sense. I wish you'd get me one that knows something.\nWon't you, dear?\"\n\n\"My friend, Mr. Worth, who has called with me, has kindly agreed to\nsend you another doctor, little sister--that's why I brought him to\nsee you.\"\n\nNorman extended his hand, and grasped the thin, cold one the girl\nextended. He felt the chill of death in its icy touch as he stammered:\n\n\"I'll send him right away.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" the girl replied, as a smile flitted about her weak\nmouth. She turned to Barbara with a look of infinite tenderness.\n\n\"I knew you'd come, and I knew you'd save me. You're my angel! When I\ndream at night, you're always hovering over me.\"\n\n\"I'll come again to-morrow, dearie, when the new doctor has seen you,\"\nBarbara answered, as she pressed her hand good-bye.\n\nWhen they reached the street, Norman asked:\n\n\"You knew her before she fell into evil ways?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Barbara answered, with feeling. \"She was just a little child of\njoy and sunlight. She couldn't endure the darkness. She loved flowers\nand music, beauty and love. She hated drudgery and poverty. She tried\nto work, and gave up in despair. A man came into her life at a\ncritical moment and she broke with the world. She's been sending all\nthe money she could make the past two years to her mother and four\nlittle kids. Her father was killed at work in a mine for a great\ncorporation.\"\n\n\"She can't live, can she?\" Norman asked.\n\n\"Of course not. I only did this to humour her. She has developed acute\nconsumption--she may not live a month.\"\n\nBarbara paused.\n\n\"I must leave you now--I'm very tired, and I must sleep a while before\nI attend the meeting to-night. It has been a great strain on me\nto-day, this trip with you. How do you like our boasted civilization?\nDo you think it perfect? Are you satisfied with a system which drives\nhundreds of thousands of such girls into a life of shame? Are you\ncontent with a system which produces three million paupers in a land\nflowing with milk and honey? Do you like a system which drives\nthousands to the madness of drink and suicide every year?\"\n\n\"And to think,\" responded Norman, dreamily, \"that for the past two\nyears of my manhood I've been writing verses and playing football!\nGreat God!\"\n\n\"Then from to-day we are comrades in the cause of humanity?\" she asked\ntenderly, extending her hand. His own clasped hers with firm grasp.\n\n\"Comrades!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nTHE ISLAND OF VENTURA\n\n\nNorman had never been a boy to do things by halves. In college, when\nhe went in for football, he made it the one supreme end of life--and\nwon. He incidentally managed to pull through a course in mining\nengineering. He knew mining by instinct and inheritance from his\nfather. It came easy.\n\nWhen he had a three months' vacation from football he took up the\nmodelling of a dredge for mining gold from the sands of the beaches.\nThe thing had never been perfected, but after three months' experiment\nand study he was just on the point of making the castings for the\nmachinery when the football season opened and he dropped such trifling\nmatters for the more serious work of training his men for a successful\nseason. He won the championship and forgot the dredge.\n\nInto the new movement of Socialism he naturally threw his whole\npersonality without reservation. Its daring programme thrilled him.\nThe audacity of its leaders and their refusal to discuss anything less\nthan the salvation of man appealed to every instinct of his nature.\nHe devoured every book on the subject he could find, and in his\nnew-found enthusiasm for humanity accepted as the inspired voice of\nGod their wildest visions of social regeneration.\n\nIn his work of charity and organization with Barbara he found\neverything to confirm and nothing to shake his faith in these\ntheories. When once he caught the idea that all the ills of modern\ncivilization were due directly to the fiendish system of \"capitalism\"\nand its \"iron law of wages,\" it was the key which unlocked every\nmystery of Pain and every tragedy of the Soul. All sin and crime and\nshame and suffering became the incidents of a social system whose\nmovements were as inexorable as Fate, as merciless as Death. There was\nbut one thing worth talking about, and that was how to destroy modern\nsociety, root and branch, and do it quickly, thoroughly and without\ncompromise.\n\nThe same daring enthusiasm and capacity for leadership which made him\nthe captain of his football team brought him at once to the front as a\nSocialist leader. He would have gained this leadership had he been the\npoorest man among them. It was a gift as his birthright.\n\nBut, added to this capacity for daring and successful action, was his\nwealth and social prestige. He had cast his lot with a class whose\navowed purpose was to destroy all social distinctions, to level all\nwealth to a common standard. And for this reason in particular he was\nconspicuous and heroic in the eyes of his Socialist comrades.\n\nHe found soon after his entrance into their active councils that the\nwoman known to the world as \"The Scarlet Nun,\" to her associates as\n\"Sister Catherine,\" was the inspiring brain of their movement in the\nWest. This remarkable woman interested him deeply from their first\nhour's talk. Born in Poland and educated in Germany, she spoke\nfluently the Russian, German, French, and English languages. She had\nled two great strikes of women workers in New York and had been\narrested, convicted, and sentenced twice to the penitentiary for\nexciting riots. To her associates she had always remained a saint and\na martyr for their cause.\n\nShe had been married before her association with Wolf had begun, ten\nyears ago. Her first husband had been divorced, and her marriage to\nWolf had been merely \"announced\" at a Socialist meeting. And yet the\nyoung millionaire had never questioned the sincerity of their devotion\nor the apparent happiness of their union. He was amazed at her\nlearning, her grasp of affairs, the simplicity and refinement of her\nmanners, and the charm of her conversation.\n\nWolf he found to be a man of wide reading and deep convictions. As he\ncame in daily contact with these two powerful personalities, and\nwatched the singular zeal with which they devoted themselves to their\nself-appointed task of destroying modern society, he could not divest\nhimself of the impression that they belonged to a religious order and\nwere leading a crusade, as the monks of the Middle Ages led men and\nwomen to die to rescue the tomb of Christ from the desecration of Turk\nand Saracen.\n\nThe woman in particular gave him this impression of religious\nfanaticism. The apparent simplicity and austerity of her life, the\ntireless zeal with which she planned and worked for the spread of the\ngospel of Socialism, to his mind gave the lie emphatically to all the\nstories he had read of her affairs with men.\n\nThe only moments of suspicion about her which ever clouded his mind\ncame with the accidental discovery that she had skilfully managed to\nthrow him and Barbara together for a day. It seemed just a little like\nthe old habit of a scheming mamma angling for the rich young man, and\ndeliberately using the beauty of her daughter as the bait with which\nto land him in the household.\n\nYet, when he found himself with Barbara he had always dismissed the\nthought as absurd. Whatever might be the dimly formed design in the\nback of the older woman's fancy, her brilliant prot\u00c3\u00a9g\u00c3\u00a9 gave no sign of\nbeing her accomplice.\n\nNorman had found Barbara a charming but baffling enigma. She walked\nthrough a world of sin and shame, filth and mire, with never a speck\non the white of her soul or body. She spoke in the simplest and most\ndirect way of things about which the ordinary girl in society would\nnever dare to utter a word, and yet he took it as a matter of course.\nHe grew to feel that she was a mysterious messenger from the spirit\nworld. Yet when he took her arm and felt its warm round lines soft and\nthrilling against his own, or the warmth of her lithe body pressing\nclose to his side in some lonely or dangerous spot on their rounds of\nwork, he was brought up sharply against the fact that she was both\nflesh and spirit. Yet the moment he tried to draw nearer to her inner\nthoughts, he found her a skilful little fencer, an adept in all the\narts of the most delicate and subtle coquetry.\n\nHe grew at last, however, to know, with unerring masculine instinct,\nthat with all her brave and frank talk about her \"fallen\" sisters, she\nhadn't an idea of what their fall really meant. She was as innocent\nas a child, and when at last she caught the young athlete smiling at\none of her apparently frank and learned discussions of the modern\ndegradation of woman, she blushed and became silent. Whereat he\nlaughed, and she became so angry they parted in silence.\n\nBaffled in his efforts to approach Barbara's heart, he threw himself\nwith zeal into the Cause. When two months had been spent in mastering\nthe details of the Socialist programme, in studying its history and\nthe condition of its movement, he called a meeting of the council of\nthe Socialist Club, and fairly took away the breath of the Wolfs and\nBarbara by the magnitude and audacity of a scheme which he proposed to\nlaunch immediately.\n\nHe had secured, without consulting any of his associates, an option on\na rich, beautiful, and fertile island off the coast of Southern\nCalifornia. It was owned by a corporation which had invested more than\na million dollars in its improvement. The enterprise had failed for\ntwo reasons--the money had been expended recklessly in the days of the\nfamous land boom, and it had been found impossible to induce labourers\nto isolate themselves on this lonely spot, sixty miles from the coast\nof Santa Barbara, with no means of regular connection with the outside\nworld.\n\nHis eyes flashing with enthusiasm and his voice ringing with\nconviction, Norman closed his description of the island of Ventura\nwith a demand for its immediate purchase by the Socialists.\n\n\"It can be bought,\" he declared impetuously, \"for $200,000. A million\ndollars' worth of improvements are already there. I propose that we\nimmediately raise $500,000, buy this island, establish a steamship\nline, plant a colony of ten thousand Socialists, found the Brotherhood\nof Man, build a model city, and create a vast fund for the propaganda\nof our faith.\"\n\nBarbara's brown eyes danced with excitement, her cheeks flushed, while\nher little hands clapped approval.\n\n\"Good! Good! It's great! It's beautiful! We must do it!\" she cried.\n\nWolf grimly shook his head.\n\n\"The idea has failed a hundred times. We must conquer the world by\npolitical action--we have the weapon in our hand--manhood suffrage.\nAll colonies fail sooner or later. They are corrupted from\noutside----\"\n\n\"Just so!\" Norman interrupted. \"But this one you can't reach from the\noutside. We will own the only means of communication. We will inherit\nall the advantages of modern civilization with none of its drawbacks.\nWe can demonstrate the truths we hold and from our impregnable\nGibraltar send out our missionaries to conquer the world. We will not\nmerely dream dreams and see visions; we will make history. We will\nprove the God that's in man and establish the fact of his universal\nbrotherhood.\"\n\n\"It's a wonderful idea, comrade!\" Catherine exclaimed, with\nenthusiasm. \"I congratulate you! We will accept your plan, and I move\nthat we appoint you our agent vested with full power to collect this\nfund from the enemy!\"\n\nThe motion was put and carried unanimously, even Wolf voting for it.\n\nBarbara sprang to Norman's side, and grasped his hand:\n\n\"Our feud is over! I forgive you for laughing at me. You are a born\nleader. You've won your spurs to-night. You will raise this money?\"\n\n\"As sure as I'm living!\" was the firm reply.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nTHE RED FLAG\n\n\nNorman lost no time in springing his scheme for the establishment of\nthe Socialist colony and headquarters for the propaganda of the new\nsocial religion on the island of Ventura. The season he had spent as a\nreporter gave him the key to the proper launching of a press story\nwhich created a profound sensation. It appeared simultaneously in the\nSunday editions of all the leading dailies of the Pacific coast, and\nin forty-eight hours his mail had grown to such proportions that he\nrequired two secretaries to assist him in answering it.\n\nHe called for a thousand volunteers to join the advance-guard of the\ncoming Brotherhood of Man, each contributing a thousand dollars. He\nannounced a mass meeting and picnic for the Fourth of July, to be held\non the big lawn of the Worth country house on the outskirts of\nBerkeley.\n\nColonel Worth had readily given his consent to the use of the lawn. He\nhad not tried in any way to interfere with his son's association with\nthe Socialists. He felt sure that in time he would tire of the fad,\nas he had of football, and in a fatherly way he began to admire the\ndash and audacity of the boy's plans.\n\nOn the morning of the picnic, when Elena expressed her fears of the\noutcome, the Colonel laughed.\n\n\"Don't worry, Elena. He'll come to his senses. It's like a fever. It\nmust run its course. I'm rather proud of the extravagance of his\nfoolishness. A boy who can forget his games and give his life to\ndestroy the foundations of human society and try to rebuild a new\nworld on its ruins--well, there's good stuff in him.\"\n\n\"But if he does something rash?\" Elena persisted.\n\n\"He won't. With all his extravagance and enthusiasm he's not a fool.\nI, too, saw visions like that once.\"\n\n\"You, Guardie?\"\n\n\"Yes, when I was very, very young--a mere boy of thirteen--I joined a\ncolony of Communists.\"\n\n\"I wish I could have seen you at thirteen,\" Elena cried, with a joyous\nlaugh.\n\nThe laugh died suddenly and a frown overspread her face as Norman\nappeared.\n\n\"I want you and Elena to hear our orator to-day, Governor,\" Norman\nsaid, with enthusiasm. \"We are going to make it a great day.\"\n\n\"It's already great, my boy--I've just got the news.\"\n\n\"What news?\"\n\nThe Colonel drew a telegram from his pocket.\n\n\"A message from Washington. Sampson and Schley have annihilated the\nSpanish fleet. Admiral Cervera is a prisoner on board the flagship,\nand the army is rapidly closing in on the doomed city of Santiago.\"\n\nHe handed the telegram to Norman, who glanced at it in silence and\nreturned it to his father.\n\n\"Come to our meeting on the lawn at noon, Governor. We've bigger news\nthan that for you.\"\n\n\"Bigger news?\" the older man asked with a quizzical look.\n\n\"Yes. A message announcing the dawn of a day when every gun on earth\nshall be broken to pieces and melted into ploughshares.\"\n\nThe Colonel looked at Norman a moment, smiled, and slowly said:\n\n\"I love the young--because I live myself over again in them.\"\n\n\"Then you'll join us to-day?\"\n\n\"Thanks--no--Elena and I are going to shoot firecrackers--but we won't\ndisturb your crowd. Let them speak to their hearts' content.\"\n\nThe Colonel turned with Elena, and entered the house, which crowned an\neminence overlooking the distant bay and city, while Norman hurried\ndown the green sloping lawn to finish the decorations of the speakers'\nstand.\n\nThe crowd had already begun to pour in from Oakland and San Francisco,\nand more than a hundred delegates from Socialist locals in other\ncities were expected.\n\nOn a little headland which jutted out from the long sloping mountain\nside on which the lawn was laid out, Colonel Worth had erected a tall\nsteel flag-pole. The big flag which flew from its peak could be seen\nby every ship that entered or left the bay and for miles on shore in\nalmost every direction.\n\nAround this flag-pole Norman had built the speakers' platform, with\nevery inch of its boards covered with the deep-red bunting symbolic of\nthe Socialist cause. Behind the stand toward the mountains rose a\nsmooth grass-carpeted hillside in semi-circular form, making a natural\namphitheatre on which five thousand people might sit in tiers one\nabove the other and distinctly hear every word uttered on the\nplatform.\n\nBy noon every inch of this space was packed with a dense crowd of\nSocialists, their friends, and the curious who had come, drawn by the\nsensational announcement of the launching of the Socialist colony on\nthe island of Ventura.\n\nIn the front row, packed close against the platform, were a number of\nfamous people--conspicuous among whom was an author whose impassioned\nstories of the coming social upheaval had resulted in fame for himself\nand a divorce-suit by his first wife. His new wife, the \"affinity\" who\ncaused the disturbance, sat by his side.\n\nOn his left sat a solemn looking poet with bushy, unkempt hair. He had\ndeliberately chosen the title \"The Bard of Ramcat.\" The name Ramcat\nhad been long applied to a shabby section of the outskirts of San\nFrancisco. Here the poet had chosen to dwell and sing of social\nhorrors which existed only in his fertile imagination.\n\nHe had won wide fame, however, as the supreme exponent of the\n\"affinity\" theory which has always been epidemic among thoughtful\nSocialists. He coolly informed his wife that he had discovered his\ntrue \"affinity\" in a woman he had installed as her guest. The two\naffinities accompanied the wife and her child to a steamer for Europe\nwith instructions to obtain a divorce.\n\nThe poet married the affinity, and on the birth of a new son and heir\nacquired the habit of beating her as a form of relaxation from the\nstrain of work. Considerable trouble followed, and he spent a portion\nof his time in jail. He had once gone barefooted and bareheaded. But\nsince his \"affinity\" marriage he had been compelled for reasons best\nknown to himself to resume shoe-leather and to buy a hat. Nevertheless\nhe was still a striking-looking figure, seated beside his new wife\nwhose strong, intellectual face won the sympathy of all who saw her.\n\nJust behind him sat an ex-clergyman with whom a rich young woman in\nhis congregation had fallen in love. To avoid trouble, the woman of\nwealth got him to leave the ministry, and bought him from his wife for\na good round sum. He became an apostle of the new gospel of Socialism,\nand secured a position as a professor of economics. When finally he\nlost this position by his vagaries, his wife hired a hall and set him\nup in business as an inspired leader of new thought emancipated from\nthe chains of capitalistic tyranny.\n\nBeside the distinguished ex-clergyman Socialistic apostle sat\nProfessor Otto Schmitt, a famous teacher of economics at a Western\nuniversity. His supreme passion was hatred of women. His one big book\nwas written to prove that woman has no soul, that she is the mere\nmatter on which man by his will acts, that she is not immoral, but\nmerely non-moral, having never possessed even the rudiments of a moral\nnature. Schmitt had, therefore, maintained that the entrance of women\ninto competition in the economic world presaged the downfall of man\nand the utter extinction of humanity. For this reason he had joined\nthe Socialists.\n\nNot three feet away from him sat a thoughtful, elderly, short-haired\nwoman who had written a book on the evolution of woman to prove that\nwoman alone is the original unit of creation, man a superfluous and\ntemporary addition, merely the missing link between woman and the\nmonkey, and in the process of human development the male biped would\nbe eliminated. She demanded equal rights with man, and more besides,\nand she, too, had joined the Socialists.\n\nYet through all these ludicrous incongruities there ran the single\nscarlet thread of social discontent which made them one. In every soul\nrang the stirring cry:\n\n\"Down with civilization! Up with the Red Flag!\"\n\nA more remarkable group of men and women could scarcely be gathered\ntogether on the face of the earth. But the one mark they all bore,\ndistinctly cut deep in the lines of every face on which character had\nset its seal, and written large in the restless, nervous personality\nof the young--they all had a grievance, and though their troubles\nmight come from as many different causes as there were men and women\npresent, they united in one thought:\n\n\"Modern civilization must be destroyed!\"\n\nEvery heart beat with this fiery resolution, and every incongruity\nmelted and faded into insignificance before this consuming belief.\n\nAnd they had gone about this purpose with a deadly earnestness which\nmeant business. Their political campaigns were merely moments when the\ncaptain of their ship cast the lead-line to feel the bottom and find\nhis position with certainty before signalling full speed ahead.\n\nThey worked all the year round and every day in every year, from one\nelection to the next. They were mastering the tricks of the demagogue\nin their appeal to the masses, and they kept everlastingly at it. No\nman is too high, no man too low, for them to reach for him. They\ncouldn't be beaten for they had accepted defeat before they began to\nfight, and began the next fight before they got up from the ground\nwhere they had been knocked down. They had become the one element in\nAmerican politics to which it was utterly useless to direct any\nargument of expediency.\n\nThe Fourth of July, the Nation's birthday, they were now using to\ndemand its extinction. The fact that our army and navy had just torn\nthe flag of Spain from its last masthead in the Western hemisphere and\nstartled the old world with our sudden advent among the great powers\nof the earth, stirred in their hearts no emotion save that of\ncontempt. While the souls of millions beat with patriotic pride, they\nhad met to uproot the very ideas from whose soil patriotism sprang\ninto life.\n\nThere was no question as to who should be the orator of the day. The\nfame of Barbara Bozenta had become national from the day of her first\nspeech in San Francisco. Her beauty and eloquence were sufficient to\npack any hall at twenty-four hours' notice.\n\nHer delicate face was radiant to-day with unusual elation. She walked\nwith a quick, nervous energy that seemed to lift her whole body into\nthe air. As she ascended the platform and bowed to the tumult of\napplause, she trembled from head to foot with intensest excitement. As\nshe stood looking over the inspiring scene for a moment, her sensitive\nnostrils dilated, her brown eyes flashed, and her heart beat with a\ngreat throb of personal pride. She had never before faced such an\nimmense throng of excited men and women, and the secret consciousness\nthat she had within her soul the message which would sweep their\nheartstrings as she willed, lifted her into the clouds.\n\nShe felt for the moment that the whole scene was a tribute to her\npower. The magnificent house whose windows flashed in the sunlight,\nthe vast lawn carpeted with green and set in dazzling flowers, the\nemerald waters of the bay, and the spires and domes of the distant\ncity set on its proud hills beyond--all were hers to-day! Her voice\nhad called to their standard the young millionaire whose name was now\non every lip. Her voice had inspired his dream of the experiment to be\nmade on the island of Ventura which had called this host together. For\none big moment she felt the thrill of conscious creative genius, the\npain, the joy, the glory of a positive achievement.\n\nHer eyes suddenly filled with tears, and she sank to her seat with a\nsuppressed sob.\n\nWhen at last she rose to speak, her whole personality was a quivering\nbattery of resistless emotion. Her voice, low and pulsing with\nmagnetic waves of suppressed feeling, caught and chained the attention\nof the farthest straggler on the edge of the throng. Instinctively\nthey moved closer. Resistlessly she drew them.\n\nShe had not spoken two minutes before she was sweeping the hearts of\nher hearers. Men and women who had come to laugh or scoff, as well as\nthe young and thoughtless who had drifted with the crowd, were all\nalike caught in the spell and hung breathless on her words.\n\nEvery trick and art of persuasive speech were hers without effort.\nScorn, pathos, humour, passion, were of the breath she breathed. At\ntimes her eloquence reached the highest conception of its might. It\nwas simple thought packed until it took fire. At such moments scores\nof men leaped to their feet and shouted. Nothing disconcerted her or\nchanged the swift current of her ideas. She was a master-musician\nwhose hands swept a harp of a thousand strings--every string a\nthrobbing human soul.\n\nWhat matter if her appeal was to the emotions and not to the\nintellect? Her purpose was to persuade her hearers. And she did it.\nHer courage, her beauty, her skill, her utter sincerity, commanded the\nrespect of the strongest man who listened. If their intellects were\nnot convinced, no matter--she carried them with her on a storm of\nresistless emotion.\n\nSuddenly a thing happened which would have destroyed the total\nimpression of the average speech. Old Methodist John, her pauper\nprot\u00c3\u00a9g\u00c3\u00a9, had listened with increasing torture, choking down a hundred\n\"Glorys\" as they leaped from his soul until at last he could endure no\nmore. At the climax of one of her impassioned appeals the old man\nleaped to his feet, rushed in front of the speakers' stand and shouted\ninto the face of the chairman:\n\n\"Look here! Look here, now, Wolf! Soup or no soup--Glory hallelujah!\"\n\nBarbara alone smiled. The crowd took up his shout, and a thousand\nvoices made the heavens ring with its wild music.\n\nNorman whispered to the old man, who sat down, and Barbara swept on in\nher impetuous triumph without the lapse of a moment's power. She\nseized the instant's hush which followed the storm of cheering to fire\ninto the minds of her hearers some of the solid shot of the\nrevolutionary programme.\n\nIn a voice which swelled to the clarion note of a trumpet she cried:\n\n\"The earth for all the people! This is our demand!\n\n\"The machinery of all production and distribution for all the people!\nThis is our demand!\n\n\"The collective ownership and control of all industry! This is our\ndemand!\n\n\"The elimination of rent, interest, and profit! This is our demand!\n\n\"A new social order, a higher civilization, a real republic! This is\nour demand!\n\n\"The end of the hell called war, of poverty and shame, of cruelty and\ncrime, the birth of freedom, the dawn of brotherhood, the beginning of\nman! These are our demands! This is Socialism! Is this an idle dream?\nHave you no faith in your fellow man?\n\n\"In the grim prison beyond the bay I found one day a woman convict who\nwas little removed from a fiend. I got permission to hang a beautiful\npicture in her cell--a picture that set her soul to dreaming, that\nmelted her at last to tears, and transformed the beast within her to a\ngentle, loving, beautiful, human character.\n\n\"I believe in man because he alone possesses this power to look\nthrough the window of the soul into the infinite and eternal. Here the\nworld's real battles are fought. Here the world's real work is done.\nHere cowards run and the brave die. This power to recreate the earth,\npeople it with beauty, and fill it with harmony is your birthright.\n\n\"Lo, the day of humanity dawns!\n\n\"I preach class consciousness that we may destroy all classes. Class\nmust perish and Man be glorified. Man, whose inhumanity to his fellow\nman has filled the ages with ashes and tears, is coming forth at last\npurified by suffering, and we shall see his tears turned to smiles\nupon the faces of a nobler race.\n\n\"Why should we rejoice to-day in the death of our fellow man? Nations\nare but the dung-heaps out of which the fair flower of a\nworld-democracy is slowly growing. Truth is not national, it is\ninfinite. France may fight Germany because two titled fools insult\neach other, but there can be no war between the laboratories of\nPasteur and of Koch. Their work is the common heritage of humanity.\nWho asks if Humboldt was German or English, whether Spinoza was Jew or\nGentile, Darwin English or French? A German wrote 'Faust,' a Frenchman\nset it to immortal music, and an American girl sang it into the hearts\nof millions. Who cares to know nationalities? The great belong to the\ndemocracy of the world. And I swear that your children will still\nlaugh with the soul of Cervantes in spite of the Fourth of July,\nSantiago, and Manila!\n\n\"Why should you fight one another? When called to war by your rulers,\nlet the liberty-loving spirits of the modern world say to their\nmasters:\n\n\"'Go and do your own killing--you who have separated us from our\nbrothers and made the earth a slaughter-pen.'\n\n\"If you are court-martialed and shot for this act of heroism remember:\n\n    \"'They never fail who die\n    In a great cause: the block may soak their gore:\n    Their heads may sodden in the sun: their limbs\n    Be strung to city gates and castle walls--\n    But still their spirit walks abroad. Though years\n    Elapse and others share as dark a doom,\n    They but augment the deep and sweeping thoughts\n    Which overpower all others, and conduct\n    The world at last to freedom!'\"\n\nA shout of wild applause rent the air as the last note of Byron's\nimmortal song fell from her beautiful lips. And then, in a low,\nintense voice, she closed her speech with a thrilling appeal for human\nbrotherhood. To Norman, who hung on her lips, the slight girlish\nfigure seemed transformed before their eyes into a radiant messenger\nof the spirit. And when the sweet womanly tones at last broke and\nchoked into deep-drawn sobs, his soul and body seemed no longer his\nown. As her last words sank into his heart: \"From to-day let each of\nus swear allegiance to but one flag, the deep-red emblem of human\nblood, God's sign of universal brotherhood!\" Norman leaped to his\nfeet, sprang on the platform, and while the crowd swayed in a frenzy\nof applause, hauled down the Stars and Stripes and quickly raised the\nbig red standard of Socialism which was thrown across the speaker's\ntable.\n\nAnd then the great crowd seemed to go mad. Wave after wave of cheering\nrose and fell, rose and fell, in apparently unending power. Catherine\nthrew her arms around Barbara in a paroxysm of emotion, while the big\nfigure of Wolf towered above them both, shouting and gesturing like a\nmadman. Barbara at last lifted her hand and, as the storm subsided,\nbegan the Marseillaise hymn.\n\nThe first stirring notes had just swept the audience when the stalwart\nfigure of Colonel Worth suddenly appeared on the platform, his face a\nblaze of anger, his magnificent figure erect, every nerve and muscle\ndrawn to the highest tension.\n\nHe stepped to the edge of the stand, lifted his head, and his voice\nrang over the crowd like the sudden boom of a cannon:\n\n\"Silence!\"\n\nHe didn't repeat the word.\n\nThe singing stopped, and every eye was riveted on the group that stood\non the platform.\n\nThe Colonel confronted Wolf, and shot his words at him as though from\na machine-gun.\n\n\"Who lowered that flag?\"\n\nA moment of silence followed. The Colonel spoke with increasing\nrapidity.\n\n\"Who lowered that flag? The man who did it must answer to me!\"\n\nSome one behind him moved, and the Colonel turned, confronting Norman.\n\n\"I did it, Governor,\" was the quiet answer.\n\n\"You?\" the father gasped.\n\n\"Yes,\" said the even, firm voice.\n\n\"Haul that red rag down and raise the flag back to its place!\" The\nColonel's voice was low and thick with rage.\n\nElena put her hand on his arm and said gently:\n\n\"Guardie!\"\n\n\"Will you do it?\" he firmly asked, ignoring Elena, and holding Norman\nwith his gaze.\n\nThe young man hesitated an instant, met his father's look with a\ndeadly straight stare, and slowly replied:\n\n\"I will not.\"\n\nA smothered cry from Barbara, half joy, half pain, was the only sound\nthat followed, until the Colonel said:\n\n\"Then I'll do it for you.\"\n\nAmid a dead silence he hauled down the red flag, threw it on the\nfloor, boldly stamped on it, made fast the Stars and Stripes, and\nquickly raised it to the top of its staff. He turned to the crowd, and\nin clear-cut, sharp tones of command shouted:\n\n\"This is my flag, my house, my lawn. Get off it! And do it quick!\"\n\nAs the crowd hastened away, he turned to Norman:\n\n\"You and I must come to an understanding at once, young man,\" he said,\nwith angry emphasis.\n\n\"I'll meet you in the library in thirty minutes,\" was Norman's firm\nreply as he led Barbara from the platform and joined the retreating\nthrong.\n\n    [Illustration: \"LIFT THE FLAG BACK TO ITS PLACE.\"]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nFATHER AND SON\n\n\nThe Colonel paced the floor of his library with increasing anger as he\nwaited the return of Norman. Never in his life had his whole being\nbeen so abandoned to incontrollable rage. He had always been a man of\nfiery temper, but an iron will had held his temper in control.\n\nHis most intimate business associates had always found him suave,\npersuasive, and genial in every hour of trial. Never once had they\nheard a threat or an idle boast fall from his lips. He had the rare\nfaculty of beating his enemies in a fight in which no quarter was\nasked or given, and coming out of it with his bitterest foe turned\ninto a friend. This was one of the secrets of his fortune--an\ninstinctive leadership among powerful men.\n\nFor the first time he realized that he had challenged the one man in\nall his personal acquaintance about whose character he knew\nnothing--his own son. For the first time he realized that they were\nstrangers. He had been absorbed in the big affairs of life. He had\ntaken the boy for granted. Since the death of his mother twelve years\nago, Norman had spent most of his time at school.\n\nThe Colonel had always been in command. His word had been law for so\nmany years, it brought him up with a disagreeable start to find that\nthe one man with whom his life was bound, and in whom his hopes\ncentred, could dare thus to defy and flaunt his wishes. It was the\nmost disgusting, enraging fact he had ever encountered. The longer he\nconfronted the situation the more furious and blind his anger became.\n\nElena had timidly entered the room, and stood watching him gravely\nbefore she spoke.\n\n\"Has he returned from that woman yet?\" the Colonel asked with sudden\nenergy.\n\n\"No, and I hope he will stay all day,\" she answered slowly.\n\n\"But he won't,\" the father snapped.\n\n\"I'm sure he will not,\" the girl sighed. \"I don't like you to-day,\nGuardie.\"\n\n\"You, too, side with these fanatics then?\"\n\n\"No. I hate them--hate everything they say and do and stand for. I\nloathe the very sight of them. But you were unfair to Norman.\"\n\n\"Unfair? How?\"\n\n\"You allowed him the widest liberty to do as he pleased, think as he\npleased, associate with whom he pleased, and then all of a sudden you\nsprang on that platform and insulted him before his invited guests.\"\n\n\"How could I dream that he would commit such an act of insane treason\nbefore my very eyes?\"\n\n\"You make no allowance for the spell of Barbara Bozenta's eloquence. I\ndon't like her, but she's a wonderful little woman, and I envy her her\npower over men.\"\n\n\"I'll end this folly to-day,\" was the Colonel's firm announcement.\n\n\"I'm not so sure,\" Elena warned.\n\n\"I'll show you!\"\n\nShe came close and laid her hand on the Colonel's arm.\n\n\"Will you promise me one thing, Guardie?\" she asked, tenderly.\n\nThe anger faded from the strong face, and his voice sank low.\n\n\"I'm afraid I've never been able to refuse you anything, child. It's\non your account, I think, I'm most angry with Norman to-day.\"\n\n\"You promise?\" she repeated.\n\n\"Yes, what is it?\" he said, bending to kiss her smooth, white\nforehead.\n\n\"Promise to put all anger out of your heart and talk to Norman as a\nfather, not as an enemy--won't you?\"\n\n\"An enemy?\" the Colonel slowly asked.\n\n\"Yes. I thought you were going to strike him once. It would have been\nhorrible. I never could have forgiven you for that. You've always been\nmy hero, Guardie--I never saw you give way to anger before. I don't\nlike it. You'll talk to him lovingly and tenderly as a father, won't\nyou?\"\n\n\"Yes, dear, for your sake, I will,\" he answered.\n\n\"Then I'll tell him to come. I asked him to wait outside until I saw\nyou.\"\n\nShe turned and quickly left the room. In a moment Norman entered and\nstood facing his father.\n\nThe Colonel flushed with anger at sight of the insolence with which\nthe younger man calmly surveyed him.\n\n\"Well, sir,\" the father said, at length, \"have you nothing to say to\nme after what has occurred to-day?\"\n\n\"I was under the impression that you had something to say to me,\" was\nthe cool answer.\n\nBy an effort of will the older man crushed back an angry retort,\nsmiled, and said:\n\n\"Sit down, please--I've a good deal to say to you.\"\n\nNorman threw himself lazily into a chair, and continued to watch his\nfather with a curious expression of half-amused contempt. The Colonel\nstood in silence, evidently struggling with his emotions, and feeling\nfor the right word with which to begin.\n\nNorman anticipated him.\n\n\"Honestly, now, Governor, just between us, don't you think you were a\nlittle bit absurd to-day?\"\n\n\"Absurd?\" his father broke in with rising accent.\n\n\"Just a little childish about a piece of red, white, and blue cloth?\"\n\n\"Perhaps so, my boy,\" was the answer. \"Just about as absurd as you\nwere over the red rag you lifted in its place. Why did you do it?\"\n\n\"On the impulse of the moment, to express my feeling of contempt for\nwar, and my faith in my fellow man.\"\n\n\"Exactly. So I acted on the impulse of the moment to express my\ncontempt for that crowd of fools and fanatics--my loyalty and faith in\nmy country.\"\n\n\"I can't understand how a man of your age, poise and pride, culture\nand power, could be so foolish. A sixteen-year-old school-boy on the\nFourth of July, yes! But you----\"\n\n\"Norman,\" the Colonel interrupted, in even tones, \"I'm sorry I've been\ntoo busy for us to get acquainted. It's time we began. It may\ninterest you to know that I, too, hate war--learned to hate it long\nbefore your Socialist orator was born--learned it in the grim\nUniversity of Hell--war itself. Socialism has no patent on the hope of\nuniversal peace. I am a member of a peace society. I have always\nbelieved the Civil War should have been prevented. All the Negroes on\nthis earth are not worth the blood and tears of one year of that\nstruggle. Whether it could have been prevented God alone knows. When\nit came I volunteered--a drummer-boy at fourteen--and marched to the\nfront beneath the flag you tore down to-day.\"\n\n\"I never thought of that, Governor--honestly, I never did!\" the boy\nexclaimed.\n\n\"I went in,\" the Colonel continued, \"with my head full of silly\nrubbish about the glory of war. When I beat the call to my first\ncharge, and saw the men I knew and loved shot to pieces, and heard\ntheir groans and cries for water, I had no more delusions. I worked on\nthe field that night until twelve o'clock, helping the men who were\nwounded--enemies as well as comrades. I learned the brotherhood of man\nand the meaning of red blood in the big, tragic school of life, my\nson. Many a boy in gray, whom I had fought, died in my arms while my\nheart ached for his loved ones in some far-away Southern home.\n\n\"But I knew the war had to be when once it was begun. I was fighting\nfor the flag I loved--and I grew to love it better than life. To you\nit may be a bit of red, white, and blue bunting; to me it is the\nsymbol of truth and right, liberty and human progress.\n\n\"My people in western North Carolina were all slave-holders and loyal\nto their state, except my father. He hated slavery, loved the Union,\nand moved on westward before the war. I saw them bury him in the flag\nyou tore down to-day, my boy.\n\n\"Many a night I've lain on the ground looking up at the stars before\nthe dawn of a day of battle and seen visions of that flag flying\ntriumphant in the sky. I've seen the men who carried it shot down\nagain and again, and another snatch it from their dying grasp and bear\nit on to victory.\n\n\"I grew not only to love it, but to believe in it with all the\npassionate faith of my soul. I believe in its destiny, in its sublime\nmission to humanity. The older I've grown and the more I've seen of my\nfellow man, the wider I've travelled in foreign lands, the deeper has\nbecome my conviction that our flag symbolizes the noblest, freest\nideal ever born in the soul of man; that we have but to live up to its\nstandard of Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity, and the kingdom of\nhuman brotherhood is already here.\n\n\"After the war, I joined the regular army, not because I loved war,\nbut because there seemed nothing else for me to do at the time. I was\nabsolutely alone in the world. At twenty-five I was in command of a\ncompany on the frontier. I had not been in battle since the end of the\nCivil War, when suddenly I found myself surrounded by a horde of\nhostile Indians, and I had to turn my machine guns on them and mow\nthem down. The slaughter was something terrific. As the last charge\nwas made I saw a young squaw retreat in the face of a withering fire,\nwalk backward facing our men, holding a bundle of something behind her\nbody. She fell at last, riddled with bullets. I rode up where she lay,\nand found the bundle to be a little Indian baby boy. He was unhurt,\nand stretched out his hand to me in friendly baby greeting. I found\nthe squaw quite dead, and discovered the child was not her own. She\nwas simply trying to save it for the tribe. I took the child and\neducated him. But he went back to the free life of the plains. I found\nhim again, and made him the gamekeeper of our mountain preserves.\"\n\n\"You mean Saka?\" Norman asked.\n\n\"Yes. That night as I lay in my tent I saw war as it is--a hideous,\nsavage nightmare. From that moment I hated the service, hated its\niron laws of discipline, its cruel machinery devised for suppressing\nthe individuality of its members. I saw that night a larger vision of\nlife. I made up my mind to create, not to kill--to build up, not to\ntear down. I left the army and mastered mining.\n\n\"Your leather-lunged agitators say that I stole my millions from the\nearnings of the men who worked for me. A more stupid lie was never\nuttered. I invented improved mining machinery. I made deserts blossom\nand gave employment to thousands of men who couldn't think for\nthemselves. I did their thinking for them, and set their tasks. I have\nmade millions, and have added tens of millions to the wealth of the\nWest.\"\n\n\"If labour is the creator of all wealth can one man ever earn a\nmillion dollars?\" Norman interrupted.\n\n\"Manual labour is not the creator of wealth. The brain which conceives\nis the creator of wealth. The hand which executes these plans is\nmerely the automaton moved by a superior power.\"\n\n\"Yet nothing could be accomplished without it,\" persisted Norman.\n\nHis father lifted his hand with a gesture of command.\n\n\"We'll not discuss the theory of Socialism to-day, my boy. I grant you\nhave plausible arguments which skilful demagogues are using with more\nand more efficiency. I don't object to your study of this subject. I'm\nrather pleased at the serious turn your energies have taken. What I do\nobject to is your continued association with the kind of people who\nmade up that crowd to-day--people who make the agitation of the\nrevolutionary programme of the Socialists a daily profession, people\nwho are seeking to destroy modern civilization itself.\"\n\n\"You will have to come down to earth, Governor,\" Norman said, \"in your\nindictment of these people. The time has gone by when you can scare\nanybody with a few high-sounding phrases. If modern civilization is\nrotten, it ought to be destroyed, and who cares if it is?\"\n\n\"The issue between us, my boy,\" the Colonel continued, gravely, \"is\nnot an academic one. It is not open to discussion. Some of the people\nyou are associating with have criminal records. If they continue their\npresent wild harangues they will be shot down like dogs in the\nstreets. I cannot afford to have my name even under the suspicion of\nsympathy for them, through you. Do you understand me?\"\n\n\"I think I do,\" Norman replied, holding his father's steady gaze.\n\n\"You are my son and the heir of my fortune. But you must remember that\nI am the master of this establishment.\"\n\n\"I am aware of that fact, sir,\" the boy replied, in cold tones.\n\n\"I trust that it will not be necessary, then, for me to repeat to you\nmy first positive order--that you will immediately sever your\nconnection with the Socialist Club, and never again appear in public\nor private with the three people who were on that platform to-day.\"\n\n\"It will not be necessary for you to repeat your order,\" the young\nathlete replied, with a curious smile and a slight tightening of the\nlips.\n\n\"I thought as much.\"\n\nNorman laughed, and the Colonel's eyes began to blaze.\n\n\"What do you mean, sir?\" he sternly asked.\n\n\"That it will be unnecessary for you to repeat your order, for the\nvery simple reason that I'm a man. I've the right to do my own\nthinking, and I propose to do it.\"\n\nWith a quick stride the Colonel confronted the young rebel, his breath\nquick and laboured, his face aflame with unbridled rage.\n\n\"You dare thus to defy my wishes?\"\n\n\"If you put it that way, yes.\"\n\nThe Colonel stepped to the door and opened it.\n\n\"You will obey my order or get out of this house never to enter it\nagain. Take your choice!\"\n\n\"You mean it?\" the younger man asked, with sullen emphasis.\n\n\"Exactly what I say,\" was the cold reply.\n\nNorman turned without a word, seized his hat, and left the room. As he\nreached the end of the corridor, and placed his hand on the front\ndoor, his father's voice rang out suddenly:\n\n\"Norman!\"\n\nHe paused, and looked back without taking his hand from the knob.\n\n\"You can't be such a fool!\" the Colonel cried.\n\n\"It looks that way, Governor!\"\n\nHe opened the door, softly closed it, and was gone.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nTHROUGH THE EYES OF LOVE\n\n\nNorman's break with his father created a sensation. The flag episode,\ncoming on the Fourth of July and at the very hour when the guns of the\nforts were thundering their celebration of the fleet's victory at\nSantiago, presented the dramatic contrast which stirred the\nindignation of the public to unusual depths. The morning papers\ndevoted from four to five columns to the story. The remarkable speech\nof Barbara Bozenta was reported in full, with a sketch of her life,\ninterspersed with portraits of the Wolfs, of Norman, Elena, his\nfather, the palatial home on Nob Hill, and the country estate where\nthe stirring little drama had been played.\n\nThe Socialist cause received a tremendous impetus. The very violence\nof the editorial assaults on their programme reacted in their favour.\nThousands of men who did not know the meaning of the word Socialism\nbegan to read and think and discuss its principles. Their meetings\nwere crowded, and the fame of the little brown-eyed Joan of Arc\nbecame so great it was no longer possible for her to pass through the\nstreets without an escort.\n\nAll sorts of stories about the relations of the famous millionaire and\nhis son filled the air. Some were printed, others were vague rumours.\nA sensational paper published the story that they had actually come to\nblows, and had fought a duel in the big library which might have ended\nfatally for one or both but for the timely interference of Colonel\nWorth's ward, Elena Stockton.\n\nNorman became at once the hero of the Socialist's cause. His\nappearance at a meeting was the signal for pandemonium to break loose.\nHe secured employment on a sensational daily paper, and his signed\narticles were made a feature.\n\nColonel Worth was so enraged over the vulgar notoriety with which the\nincident had overwhelmed him that he denied himself to all callers,\nrefused to speak to a reporter or to allow a word to be uttered in\nconfirmation or denial of any stories printed or rumoured.\n\nHe issued orders that Norman's name should never again be spoken in\nhis house.\n\nWhen he made this announcement to Elena her full, red lips, quivered\nand she looked at him reproachfully.\n\n\"I mean it, Elena,\" he said, sternly.\n\nThe girl spoke in tenderness.\n\n\"I don't believe you, Guardie. It isn't like you at all. I'll not\nmention his name to a servant, but I will to you.\"\n\n\"I don't want to hear it!\"\n\n\"That's because you know you've done a great wrong.\"\n\n\"I accept the responsibility. It's done, and that's the end of it.\"\n\n\"Nothing ends until it ends right, Guardie,\" spoke the soft, even\nvoice.\n\n\"I know it's hard on you, dear,\" the Colonel responded, with feeling.\n\"It was for your sake I made the issue. If he has turned from you for\na loud-mouthed vulgar agitator, he's not worth a thought. Forget that\nhe lives. I'm going to leave my fortune to you.\"\n\n\"I don't want it at the price, Guardie,\" she replied, slipping her arm\naround his neck and resting her head on his shoulder. \"I couldn't be\nhappy with such a fortune. What you've done hurts me more than it\nhurts Norman.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes. I know that you love him, child, but your happiness could\nnot be found among a crowd of criminals and revolutionists.\"\n\n\"I'm not thinking of myself,\" was the low response as she withdrew\nfrom his arms, \"I was thinking of you.\"\n\n\"Of me?\"\n\n\"Yes. You've broken my idol. To me you were the one perfect man in the\nworld. I didn't know you. I didn't know that you were hard and cold\nand cruel and selfish and proud.\"\n\n\"I'm not, Elena.\"\n\n\"You allowed Norman to drift into any crazy theory that might strike\nhis fancy. And the moment he fails to agree with your views you turn\nlike a madman and drive him into the streets.\"\n\n\"He went of his own accord. I gave him his choice.\"\n\n\"And I admire his pluck. It was a manly thing to do.\"\n\n\"It was the act of a fool.\"\n\n\"Yet, you know, Guardie, in your heart of hearts you admire him for\nit. He showed you that he was made of the same stuff as his father.\"\n\nThe Colonel scowled, and the girl took courage.\n\n\"I'm going to meet him this evening----\"\n\n\"I forbid it!\"\n\n\"You can't help it,\" she cried, as the tears slowly gathered. \"I'm\ngoing to tell him you wish to see and talk with him again.\"\n\n\"On one condition only--his absolute obedience to my wishes.\"\n\n\"I love him all the more for defying you--love him better than I ever\ndid in my life. And--and, Guardie--I don't love you any more. You are\ncruel and unjust.\"\n\nWith a sob she turned and left the room.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nA FADED PICTURE\n\n\nElena's tears had shaken the Colonel's confidence in his position as\nnothing else could possibly have done. Since she had finished her\ncourse in college two years before, and he had come in daily contact\nwith her strong personality, a most intimate and perfect sympathy had\ngrown between them. He had never before known her intuitive judgment\nto be wrong. Her impressions of character especially he had found\nsingularly accurate, her sense of right and her good taste nearly\nperfect.\n\nHe retired to his room at night with a deep sense of uneasiness. His\nanger had cooled, and in its stead a feeling of depression slowly\nsettled. From every nook and corner came memories of the boy he had\ndriven from his door. His pictures hung on the walls and stared at him\nfrom every piece of furniture on which a frame could be placed. He had\nlearned photography as a pastime years before the kodak was invented,\nand most of the pictures he had taken himself.\n\nOne photograph in particular, which stood by the clock on the mantel,\nset in a heavy frame of hammered gold, which he had made himself from\nthe product of his first mine, riveted and held his attention. His\nfirst impulse was to tear these pictures all down and throw them in\nthe fire. He had picked this one up first, to carry out his furious\nimpulse, but something held his hand and he placed it back in its old\nplace with the grim exclamation:\n\n\"No! It's the act of a coward. I've got to live with my memories--or\nsurrender at once.\"\n\nAgain and again his eye came back to this picture. He had taken it\ntwenty-three years ago in a little bedroom in a dirty hotel of a\ndesolate, God-forsaken mining town in Nevada. How well he remembered\nit! He was poor then, and had just begun the first big fight of his\nlife for wealth and power. The boy was four weeks old, and he had\ninsisted on taking the picture of the mother with the baby in her\narms. He had carefully posed her, standing by the window looking down\ninto the child's upturned face. It had turned out a remarkable\nlikeness of both--the young mother's face wreathed in smiles, tender\nand frail and happy, with the great joy of the dawn of motherhood\nshining in her eyes.\n\nHe looked at it long and tenderly. And, as a thousand memories of\nlife crowded his soul, he suddenly exclaimed:\n\n\"God in heaven! What does she say to-day if she knows what I've done?\"\n\nHis eyes blinked, and the tears blinded them.\n\nHe kissed the picture and buried his face in his hands as a sob of\nanguish shook his frame.\n\n\"The girl's right. My boy's my boy after all. I'm wrong!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nSON AND FATHER\n\n\nWhen the Colonel had greeted Elena at breakfast next morning he\nquietly asked:\n\n\"You met Norman?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"I shall be glad to see him when he comes.\"\n\nElena threw her arms impulsively around his neck.\n\n\"Now you're a darling! Now you're big and strong and good and great\nagain--and I love you.\"\n\nThe Colonel stroked her hair slowly, and asked with a smile:\n\n\"What time is he coming?\"\n\n\"He's not coming.\" Elena laughed.\n\n\"Not coming?\" the colonel repeated blankly.\n\n\"No. You're going to see him.\"\n\n\"Indeed!\"\n\n\"You see, Guardie, he is a chip off the old block.\"\n\n\"It begins to look like he's the whole block,\" the Colonel remarked,\ndryly.\n\n\"Can you blame him after the way you acted?\"\n\n\"I can't say I do, much. I like a boy of spirit----\"\n\n\"And individuality--that's your own pet idea Guardie.\"\n\nThe Colonel was silent a moment.\n\n\"Yes. I like his grit. Where will I find him?\"\n\n\"At his desk at work in the newspaper office.\"\n\n\"I'll call him up and make an appointment.\"\n\nThe Colonel seized the telephone, called the newspaper office, and\nasked for Norman. He waited for several minutes before any one reached\nthe 'phone. He scarcely recognized the short, sharp business accent of\nNorman's voice:\n\n\"Well, well, what is it?\"\n\nThe Colonel cleared his throat.\n\n\"Here! Here! Get a move on you--what's the matter--I'm in a hurry!\"\n\n\"This is your father, Norman----\"\n\n\"Get off the wire or quit your kiddin'--what do you want?\"\n\nHis father laughed.\n\n\"I beg your pardon, Governor, honestly I didn't recognize your voice\nuntil you laughed. I'm awfully glad to hear it again. What can I do\nfor you?\"\n\n\"Well, I must say I like your impudence. What can _you_ do for me? I\nwant to see you right away. Shall I call at your office?\"\n\nA pause ensued, followed by audible smiles at both ends of the wire.\n\n\"Of course not, sir. It seems a long time since I left home but I've\nnot forgotten the way. I'll come over as soon as I can leave my desk.\"\n\nTwo hours later he entered the library with a boyish laugh and grasped\nhis father's hand.\n\nThe Colonel pressed it with deep tenderness.\n\n\"You must forgive me, boy. I wasn't fair to you the other day.\"\n\nNorman tried to laugh, and stammered awkwardly:\n\n\"Well, when I hear a man of your age and experience say a thing like\nthat, Governor, I begin to fear I'm not quite as big as I thought I\nwas.\"\n\n\"Then we're both in the right mind now, to begin all over again, are\nwe not?\"\n\n\"It's with you, sir,\" was the quick reply.\n\n\"Suppose I can convince you that you have entered on a mistaken\nmission--that your programme is foolish, impossible, and dangerous?\"\n\n\"Do it, and I'll join you in trying to put an end to Socialism.\"\n\n\"Before I begin, let me ask you a very personal question.\"\n\n\"As many as you like, Governor,\" was the frank response.\n\n\"Are you mixed up in any way personally with the young woman who spoke\nhere that day?\"\n\n\"We're comrades in the cause of humanity--that's all.\"\n\n\"You're sure that it is not her personal influence over you that has\nmade you a Socialist?\"\n\n\"Only in so far as she has made me think and feel.\"\n\n\"You have not made love to her?\"\n\n\"Certainly not. I'm engaged to Elena.\"\n\n\"Then it ought to be easy for us to understand each other. Come down\nout of the clouds of theory now, and tell me exactly how you are going\nto save humanity, and let's see if we can't work together for the same\nend. A great purpose like yours ought not to separate father and\nson--you can't defend such platitudes as this, for example, which one\nof your orators got off last night--listen!\"\n\nThe Colonel took the morning paper from the table and read:\n\n\"Remember in this supreme hour that capitalism has you and your loved\nones by the throats, is stealing your substance, draining your veins,\nand reducing you inch by inch to the potter's field. Every sweating\nden cries out to you as from the depths of hell to gird up your loins\nand march forth in one solid phalanx to strike the blow that shall\nsound the knell of capitalistic despotism, and set the star of hope in\nthe skies of the despairing and dying thousands of your class who are\nat the mercy of the vampires of soulless wealth. How long shall\ncapitalism be allowed to work its devastation, spread its blighting\ncurse, destroy manhood, debauch womanhood, and grind the flesh and\nblood and bone of childhood into food for Mammon?\"\n\nThe Colonel paused.\n\n\"Such appeals to passion can only end in riot, bloodshed, and prison\nbars. You don't write such rot as that yourself, and yet the men you\nare following preach it.\"\n\n\"I'm not following just now, Governor--I'm trying to direct this\ntremendous impulse, this enthusiasm for humanity, called Socialism,\ninto a practical experiment that will demonstrate the truths of their\nfaith, and from this white city of a glorified human life send out our\nmissionaries to conquer the world. Give me ten thousand earnest men\nand women on the island of Ventura, isolated from contact with the\ncorruption of the outside, and I'll show you a miracle more wonderful\nthan if they had risen from the dead.\"\n\n\"And what are the foundations on which you propose to build this\nheaven on earth?\"\n\n\"Squarely on these principles: From every man according to his\nability; to every man according to his needs; and to every child born\nthe right to laugh and play and grow to a strong manhood and\nwomanhood. We are not civilized so long as there is one child sobbing\nto be freed from the tomb of the modern workshop, so long as there is\none man willing to work and not able to find it, so long as there is\none soul striving upward who is crushed to earth, so long as one man\nlives in idleness and luxury while his neighbour starves, so long as\nthere's one spot of this earth on which a man lives by tearing the\nbread from the lips of another.\"\n\n\"Hasn't your imagination been caught by beautiful phrases, my boy?\"\nasked the father. \"In your new State of Ventura you will give to each\nman according to his needs?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"And who will decide how much each one needs--the man who feels the\nneed or the state?\"\n\n\"The state, in the last resort.\"\n\n\"Exactly. And who will determine how large the service required of\neach man? Who will decide the question of ability?\"\n\n\"The state, of course.\"\n\n\"Are you not cutting out a pretty big job for the state, remembering\nthat the state is nothing more or less than a lot of ordinary\nsecond-rate politicians named Tom, Dick, and Harry, who individually\nor collectively haven't as much sense as you or I?\"\n\n\"In the new world it will be different.\"\n\n\"Then you are going to import a new breed of men and women?\"\n\n\"No, we will simply give the God in man a chance to be.\"\n\n\"But how about the beast that's in man--the elemental instinct to\nfight and kill--to take the woman he desires by the force of his hands\nand muscle?\"\n\n\"When man is free and strong and happy he can have no motive to kill\nor play the beast.\"\n\n\"That remains to be seen, my boy! Your assertion does not change the\nnature of man. Another problem in your scheme I can't solve is wages.\"\n\n\"We will abolish wage slavery.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, I know; but man must work--all men must work in your new\nstate?\"\n\n\"Certainly.\"\n\n\"And the man who refuses to work?\"\n\n\"Will be made to work according to his ability.\"\n\n\"Just so. We live under the wage system now--the system of free\ncontract by which labourer and employer agree. Under your system\ncontract would be abolished, and men would do what they are _told_ to\ndo--a system of _command_ instead of _contract_--is it not so?\"\n\n\"I should say just the opposite. Men are forced to work now at tasks\nthey loathe and for pay that is insufficient. Under our state they\nwould be free to choose the work for which they are fitted.\"\n\n\"And suppose they all choose one job?\"\n\n\"The state would assign their work in the last resort.\"\n\n\"There you are, once more, bowing down to the same Tom, Dick, and\nHarry. And you cannot see that Socialism would impose on man the most\ncolossal system of slavery, the most merciless because the most\nimpersonal, the world ever saw?\"\n\n\"No, I cannot. Give me a chance on one spot of earth free from the\ncorruption of your present system, and I'll show you that man is a\nchild of God, that deep in every human soul is planted the sense of\nbrotherhood, justice, and human fellowship.\"\n\n\"And you will abolish private property?\"\n\n\"Except what each man earns or makes for himself.\"\n\nThe Colonel laughed aloud.\n\n\"Can he earn a wife, or make one for himself?\"\n\n\"No; nor own one as a slave.\"\n\n\"You can never abolish private property, my boy, so long as any man\nhas the right to say, 'This woman is mine.' The home is the basis of\nmodern civilization. If you destroy it the home will not survive. If\nthe home survives it will kill Socialism. The two things can't mix.\"\n\nNorman laughed.\n\n\"And you think capitalism is building ideal homes with its drudgery\nthat kills woman--its poverty that starves the man and drives the girl\nto a life of shame?\"\n\n\"Our conditions are not ideal, my son. But they are growing better\nwith each generation. Because all homes are not ideal, you propose to\nabolish the institution. There are ten million homes in America.\nPerhaps a million of them are unhappy. Can we mend matters by\ndestroying them all?\"\n\n\"Socialism proposes to build the highest ideal of home ever seen on\nearth, founded on love--and only love.\"\n\nThe Colonel smiled sadly.\n\n\"I see I'm too late. You've got it bad. Socialism is a contagious\ndisease, imported from the old world--a brain disease, the result of\ncenturies of wrong and oppression. Its reasons for existence in this\ncountry are purely imaginary. If it were possible for you to build the\nnew State of Ventura of which you dream----\"\n\n\"Dream! We are going to do it, I tell you, Governor! We have a hundred\nthousand dollars already pledged. We hold to-morrow night a great\nmass-meeting at which five thousand Socialists will be present. Four\nhundred thousand dollars more will buy the island and give a capital\nof three hundred thousand with which to begin.\"\n\n\"Then I can't persuade you to give up this madness?\" the Colonel\nasked, tenderly.\n\n\"It's my life,\" Norman answered firmly.\n\nThe father slipped his arm around the tall, strong figure.\n\n\"All right! Remember now, from this moment on, one thing is settled\nfor good and all. My boy's my boy, right or wrong, good or bad, wise\nor foolish----\"\n\nThe Colonel's voice broke, and his grip tightened.\n\nNorman looked out of the window, blinked his eyes, and said in low\ntones:\n\n\"I understand, sir!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nTHE WAY OF A WOMAN\n\n\nAs Elena entered the library the two men fell suddenly apart as though\nashamed of the weakness of affection before a woman.\n\nThe girl pretended not to have seen, but her face was radiant.\n\nThe Colonel paused as he turned to leave the room:\n\n\"You will keep up your newspaper grind, my boy?\" he asked.\n\n\"No. I'll jump at the chance to do the big thing. I'll give my whole\ntime to it.\"\n\n\"Well, I suppose you're right. The way to do a thing is to do it.\"\n\nAs the father passed Elena he softly whispered:\n\n\"Your face shines like an angel's!\"\n\n\"I am very happy,\" was the low answer.\n\nNorman hastened to her side, and seized both her hands.\n\n\"I owe this to you, my stately queen.\"\n\n\"He would have come to the same conclusion himself. I only hastened it\na little by a suggestion,\" she replied.\n\n\"I have my own idea about the way you expressed it,\" he said with a\njolly laugh. \"Look here, Elena, I hope you don't believe that I have\nbeen disloyal to you in my association with Barbara Bozenta?\"\n\nThe girl straightened her superb figure, and broke into a laugh of\nmingled humour and irony.\n\n\"Well, I've a confession to make, Norman. I've been disloyal to you.\"\n\n\"You--disloyal--to me!\" he gasped.\n\n\"Yes. I've felt of late as though you were a big, sick baby on my\nhands, and I've grown tired of the charge.\"\n\n\"Well, upon my soul!\" he exclaimed.\n\n\"Our engagement is at an end.\"\n\n\"Elena!\"\n\n\"I'll keep your beautiful ring\"--she touched it affectionately--\"for\nthe memories that will always bind us as brother and sister. Besides,\nit will deceive your father for a while. He has enough to worry him\njust now.\"\n\nBefore Norman could pull himself together, or utter a protest, she had\nturned and left him gasping with astonishment.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nA ROYAL GIFT\n\n\nNorman resumed his place in his father's home and began a systematic,\npersistent, and enthusiastic campaign to raise the funds to purchase\nthe island of Ventura and establish the ideal Commonwealth of Man.\n\nOn the day of the big mass-meeting of Socialists, who had gathered\nfrom every state of the Golden West, Elena found her guardian seated\nalone on the broad veranda overlooking the Bay of San Francisco. A\nlook of deep trouble clouded his strong face.\n\n\"You are worried?\" she said, seating herself by his side.\n\n\"Yes, dearie,\" was the moody answer.\n\n\"Over Norman's meeting?\"\n\n\"Yes. The boy's set his heart on this big foolish enterprise. His\nfailure is a certainty. I don't know what may follow.\"\n\n\"You are sure he can't raise the money?\"\n\n\"Absolutely. The disappointment will be a stunning blow to his pride.\"\n\n\"You know that if he did succeed in raising the money, and\nestablishing his brotherhood of man, the scheme would end in failure?\"\n\n\"As clearly as I know I am living.\"\n\n\"Would you be sorry if the dream should be realized?\"\n\n\"On the other hand, I'd shout for joy to find the human race capable\nof such a miracle.\"\n\nElena gently touched his hand. \"Then, Guardie, there's but one thing\nto do,\" she said, with a deep, spiritual look in her blue eyes.\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Give Norman a round million dollars to make the experiment.\"\n\nThe Colonel looked at her in amazement, and suddenly sprang to his\nfeet, pacing the floor with feverish steps. He stopped at last before\nthe girl and studied her.\n\n\"Don't let Norman know who gave the money,\" she continued. \"It will be\na big, noble, beautiful thing to do--and--it will save him.\"\n\n\"What a wonderful woman you are, Elena!\"\n\nHe paused and looked at her steadily. \"I'm going to do it!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen Norman returned at midnight from the mass-meeting his face was\nflushed and his eyes sparkled.\n\n\"It's done, Governor! It's done!\" he fairly shouted.\n\n\"You mean the half million was subscribed?\" the Colonel asked.\n\n\"Yes, and more!\" he went on, excitedly. \"We have succeeded beyond my\nwildest hopes. We had subscriptions for a hundred thousand. Fifty\nthousand more was subscribed at the meeting by the delegates, and just\nas we were about to adjourn Judge Clark, a famous lawyer, rose and\nannounced the gift of a round million to the cause by a group of\nfriends whose names he refused to make known.\"\n\n\"And what happened?\" Elena asked.\n\n\"It's hard to tell exactly. The first thing I did was to jump over\nthree rows of seats, grab the lawyer, and yell like a maniac. We\ncarried him around the room, and shouted and screamed until we were\nhoarse. The scene was indescribable. Strong men fell into each other's\narms and cried like children.\"\n\n\"And you could get no hint of the identity of the men who gave the\nmoney?\" Elena inquired.\n\n\"Not the slightest. The deed of gift was made to me through the lawyer\nas trustee. I don't like one or two conditions, exactly, but it was no\ntime to haggle over details.\"\n\n\"What were the conditions?\" Elena interrupted, with a glance at the\nColonel.\n\n\"That the title to the island of Ventura should be vested in me\npersonally for two years. And five hundred thousand dollars should\nremain a fund in my hands as trustee to administer its income for the\nsame period. At the end of one year, or of two, I may transfer the\nwhole to the Brotherhood, or reconvey it to the original donors. I\nthink it gives too much power into one man's hands--but I'll hold it a\nsacred trust.\"\n\nThe young enthusiast's face glowed with thrilling purpose, and his\neyes were shining with unshed tears, as he laid his hand on his\nfather's shoulder and exclaimed:\n\n\"Ah! Governor, you didn't have faith enough in your fellow man! You\nsaid it couldn't be done!\"\n\n\"I congratulate you, my son,\" the Colonel gravely said, \"and I wish\nfor you the noblest success.\"\n\n\"There's no such word as fail.\" Norman cried. \"No sleep for me\nto-night! I return to the Socialist Club for a celebration. I just\ncame to tell you personally of our triumph. The deed is done, and the\nBrotherhood of Man is a thrilling fact!\"\n\nWith swift, joyous stride he threw himself into the hall and bounded\ndown the steps.\n\n\"Suppose after all, Guardie, he should succeed?\" Elena exclaimed.\n\n\"They'll start with many things in their favour,\" the Colonel\nresponded. \"The island of Ventura is said to be the most fertile and\nbeautiful spot of earth in the West. No adverse influences can reach\nthem from without. Five thousand men and women, inspired by a sublime\nfaith in themselves, may under such conditions surprise us. If\nSocialism is possible on an island of a hundred thousand acres, it's\npossible on a hundred thousand square miles, and its faith will\nconquer the world. We'll give them two years before we visit them, and\nsee what happens.\"\n\n\"Suppose they do succeed!\" Elena repeated, musingly.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\nTHE BURNING OF THE BRIDGES\n\n\nThe success which attended the launching of the new Brotherhood of Man\nwith its million-dollar endowment fund was phenomenal.\n\nThe announcement that the books were ready for the enrollment of the\npioneer group of two thousand who should locate the enterprise on the\nisland of Ventura brought twenty-five thousand applicants.\n\nThe first shock Norman's faith in man received was to collide with the\narmy of cranks who came in troops to join. Every creed of Christendom,\nevery cult of the heathen world, every ism of all the philosophies of\nthe past and the present came in droves. They got into arguments with\none another in the waiting-rooms of the Socialist headquarters, and\nsometimes came to blows. Each conceived the hour for establishing his\nown particular patent for saving the human race had come. It was an\nappalling revelation to Norman to find how many of these schemes were\nat work in the brains of people who were evidently incapable of taking\ncare of themselves.\n\nThe first week he attempted to hear each one with courtesy and\nsympathy. But after wasting six days in idiotic discussions of\npreposterous schemes he was compelled to call on the Wolfs for advice.\n\nBoth Wolf and his wife had begun to call Norman \"Chief\" from the\nmoment of their first burst of enthusiasm over the gift of the\nmillion. At times the young dreamer looked at the massive face of the\nolder man with a touch of suspicion at this sudden acceptance of his\npremiership. And yet both Wolf and Catherine (she insisted that he\ncall her Catherine) seemed so utterly sincere in their admiration, so\nenthusiastic in their faith in his ability, they always disarmed\nsuspicion. Catherine's repeated explanation of this faith when Norman\nhalted or hesitated was always flattering to his vanity, and yet\nperfectly reasonable.\n\n\"My boy, we take off our hats to you! A man can't do the impossible\nunless he tries. We didn't try. You did. The trouble with Herman, and\nwith every man of forty, is that he loses faith in himself. We get\ncareful and conservative. We lack the dash and fire and daring of\nyouth. I envy you. I salute you as the inspired leader of our\nCause--you've done the impossible! And you've just begun. We can only\nhope to help you with our larger experience.\"\n\nAt the end of a week of futile and exhausting palaver with this army\nof cranks who infest the West, Wolf, carefully watching his\nopportunity, turned to Norman and said:\n\n\"I've been waiting for you to see things a little more clearly before\nI say something to you--I think it's time.\"\n\n\"What is it?\" the young leader asked.\n\nWolf hesitated a moment as if feeling his way.\n\n\"Something he should have said sooner,\" exclaimed Catherine.\n\n\"There's but one way, comrade. Kick these fools into the street!\"\n\n\"But don't we begin to weaken the moment we do a thing like that? We\naccept the brotherhood of man----\"\n\n\"Of man, yes,\" the old leader broke in, \"but these are not men--they\nare what might have been had they lived in a sane world. They are the\nresults of the nightmare we call civilization. The kindest thing you\ncan do for a crank is to kill him. You are trying to do what God\nAlmighty never undertook--to make something out of nothing. You know,\nwhen he made Adam he had a ball of mud to start with.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid you're right,\" Norman agreed.\n\n\"When the Brotherhood is established with picked men,\" Catherine\nadded, \"we can take in new members with less care. Now it is of the\nutmost importance that we select the pioneer group of the best blood\nin the Socialist ranks--trained men and women who believe with\npassionate faith what you and I believe.\"\n\n\"Then do it,\" Norman said, with emphasis. \"I put you and Wolf in\ncharge of this first roll. I've more important work to do in\norganizing the business details of the enterprise.\"\n\nA look of joy flashed from Wolf's gray eyes into the woman's as he\ncalmly but quickly replied:\n\n\"I'll do the best I can.\"\n\n\"You ought to know by name every true Socialist on the Coast,\" Norman\nadded.\n\n\"I do, comrade, and I'll guarantee the pioneer group.\"\n\n\"Let all applicants for membership hereafter pass your scrutiny,\" were\nhis final orders.\n\nHe rose from his desk with a sigh of relief as Barbara entered the\nroom, her cheeks flushed with joy, her eyes sparkling with excitement\nfrom the ovation she had just received from the crowd which packed the\ncorridor.\n\nHis first impulse was to ask her to accompany him to the country, rest\nand play for a day. His heart beat more quickly at the thought, but as\nthe question trembled on his lips, his eyes rested on Wolf's shaggy\nhead bending over the piles of papers on his desk, and a grim fear\nshadowed his imagination. Elena's laughter suddenly echoed through his\nmemory. He recalled his father's questions. A frown slowly settled on\nhis brow, and a firm resolution took shape in his mind.\n\n\"No woman's spell to blind your senses! Clear thinking, my boy! You're\non trial before the man who gave you life. You're on trial before the\nmen whose faith gave you a million dollars to put you to the test.\nSuccess first, and then, perhaps, the joy of living!\"\n\nBarbara felt the chill of a sudden barrier between them, and looked at\nhim with a little touch of wounded pride.\n\nHe merely nodded pleasantly and hurried from the room.\n\nHe gave his whole energies at once to the larger business of the\nenterprise. The title to the property was searched with the utmost\nthoroughness and found to be perfect. Enormous sums of money had been\nspent on the island by the bankrupt wild-cat real-estate company which\nhad bought it in for improvement and exploitation. They had built a\nmagnificent hotel with accommodations for one thousand five hundred\nguests, had planted vineyards, established a winery planted vast\norchards of plums, apricots, olives, peaches, and oranges, built flour\nmills, an ice factory, and had started a number of mining and\nmanufacturing enterprises. When the bubble burst the company was\nbankrupt and the lawyers got the rest. A careful inventory showed to\nNorman that they had acquired a property of enormous value. The\nimprovements alone had cost $1,250,000, and they were worth twice that\nsum now to the colony.\n\nHe chartered a corporate society, known as \"The Brotherhood of Man,\"\nfor the purpose of legalizing the new social State of Ventura when it\nhad passed the experimental stage and he could surrender to it the\ntitle and money held in trust under the deed of gift. Two hundred\nthousand dollars was paid in cash for the island, and the remaining\ncapital held for work. A steamer was purchased to serve the colony by\nplying between the island, Santa Barbara, and San Francisco.\n\nThe Wolfs advised Norman that no mail service be asked or permitted.\n\n\"The reasons are many, comrade,\" the old leader urged. \"The first\ncondition of success in this work is the complete isolation of the\ncolony from outside influences. If modern civilization is hell, you\ncan't build a heaven with daily communication between the two\nplaces.\"\n\n\"Every man and woman who enters,\" Catherine added, \"must sign a solemn\ncontract to remain five years, enlist as soldier, and communicate with\nthe outside world only by permission of the authority of the\nBrotherhood.\"\n\n\"I see,\" laughed Norman. \"I must have the Czar's power to examine\nsuspected mail if treason or rebellion threatens.\"\n\n\"Exactly,\" cried Wolf.\n\n\"A large power to put in one man's hands!\" Norman protested.\n\n\"There's not a man or woman going to that island who wouldn't trust\nyou with life, to say nothing of a mail pouch,\" Catherine declared,\nwith a look of genuine admiration.\n\n\"You think such drastic measures to prevent communication with the\noutside world will be needed?\" Norman argued.\n\n\"Let us hope not,\" Wolf quickly replied. \"But it's better to be on the\nsafe side. The history of every experiment made in Socialism by the\nheroes and pioneers of the cause in the past shows that failure came\nin every case from just this source. We will start under the most\nfavourable conditions ever tried. Our island will be a little world\nwithin itself. Cut every line of possible communication with modern\ncompetitive society, and we can prove the brotherhood of man a living\nfact. Open our experiment to the lies and slanders of our enemies from\nwithout, and they can destroy us before the work is fairly begun. Our\ncolony would be overrun with hostile reporters from the capitalist\npress, for example----\"\n\n\"You're right,\" exclaimed Norman.\n\n\"Let every volunteer enlist in the service of humanity for five\nyears,\" repeated Catherine, \"agreeing to hold no communication with\nthe world. Make that agreement one impossible for them to break, and\nour success is as sure as that man is made in the image of God. All we\nask is a chance to prove it without interference.\"\n\n\"I agree with you,\" cried Norman, at last. \"Five years' service, with\nevery bridge burned behind us--we'll fight it out on that line.\"\n\nA look of triumph came from beneath Wolf's shaggy brows as his eyes\nrested again on the smiling madonna-like face of the woman by his\nside.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\nTHE NEW WORLD\n\n\nOn a beautiful Sunday morning in May, 1899, the steamship _Comrade_\nslowly swept through the Golden Gate with two thousand enthusiastic\nSocialists crowding her decks, shouting, cheering, laughing, crying,\nsinging their joy and faith in the new world of human brotherhood for\nwhich they had set sail.\n\nThe flag of the republic flew from her stern because the law of the\nport of entry required it. But from her huge prow rose a slender steel\nstaff, above the tips of her funnels and masts, on which flew the\nblood-red ensign of Socialism, while from every masthead huge red\nsteamers fluttered in the sky.\n\nAt noon on the following day the eager eyes of the pioneers sighted\nthe island of Ventura. At first a tiny white and blue spot on the\nhorizon, and then slowly out of the sea rose its majestic outlines,\nuntil at last the ship drew in so close to the towering mountains of\nits shore line the colonists could almost touch the stone walls with\ntheir hands.\n\nThe captain was evidently at home in the sparkling blue waters which\nrolled lazily against the perpendicular cliffs.\n\nNorman had climbed over the piles of freight, cordage, and anchors,\nand taken his stand beside the flagstaff on the ship's prow, his soul\nenraptured with the thrilling adventure on which he had embarked.\n\nHe had made two trips to the island before, but never had he seen it\nrise from the sea in such matchless glory as to-day.\n\nFar up in the sky loomed the mountain peaks still covered with snow,\nwhile the rich hills and valleys to the southward rolled laughingly in\ntheir robes of green.\n\nFive miles down the coast the ship turned her nose inshore, and slowly\nploughed her way through a narrow channel which opened between two\nhills. She quickly cleared the channel and rounded another headland,\nwhen a shout rang from her decks. Straight before them, across a\nbeautiful landlocked bay, which formed a perfect harbour, rose the\nhuge hotel, the home of the Brotherhood. The central building was\ncrowned by two tall towers, and the long wings which stretched toward\nthe sea pierced the skyline with a dozen minarets of quaint Moorish\npattern. From the flagpole on the lawn, from each graceful tower and\neach shining sun-kissed minaret, flew the scarlet ensign of Socialism.\n\nWhen the ship swept in alongside the pier the building loomed from its\nhilltop higher apparently than the mountain range behind it.\n\nBarbara clapped her hands as she ran to Norman's side.\n\n\"Look! Look at those flags! Aren't they glorious? Nobody will haul\nthem down here, will they?\"\n\nNorman lifted his eyes and looked in silence for a moment. A stiff\nbreeze was blowing from the southeast, and the two huge banners of\nscarlet stood straight from their staffs on the towers and seemed to\nfill the sky with quivering flame.\n\n\"Glorious!\" he said, at last. \"They speak the end of strife, the dawn\nof love and human brotherhood!\"\n\nThe Wolfs had preceded them to the colony with a select band of\nenthusiasts, stored the first supplies, and set the place in order to\nreceive as welcome guests the first shipload of pioneers.\n\nWhen the throng of joyous, excited comrades had landed, they formed in\nline and marched up from the pier. The wide, white, smooth road led\nthrough a wilderness of flowers which had grown in wild profusion\nsince they had been abandoned two years before. The Wolfs led the\nprocession, with Barbara and Norman by their side.\n\nWhen they reached the big circle of scarlet geraniums in the centre of\nthe floral court between the two wings of the great building they\nstopped, and Catherine began in her clear, thrilling soprano voice the\nMarseillaise hymn. The pioneers crowded around her tall, commanding\nfigure and sang with inspired emotion. Every heart beat with high\nresolve. The heaven of which they had dreamed was no longer a dream.\nThey were walking its white, shining streets. Their souls were crying\nfor joy in its dazzling court of honour. The old world, with its sin\nand shame, its crime and misery, its hunger and cold, its greed and\nlust, its cruelty and insanity, had passed away, and lo! all things\nwere new. The very air was charged with faith and hope and love. A\nwave of religious ecstasy swept the crowd. They called each by their\nfirst names. Strong men embraced, crying \"Comrade!\" through their\ntears. The older ones had made allowances for the glowing accounts of\nthe island. They expected some disillusioning at first. Yet their\nwildest expectations were far surpassed. Such beauty, such grandeur,\nsuch wealth of nature, such magnificence of equipment, were too good\nto be true, and yet they were facts.\n\nThe island of Ventura was enchanted. The impression it gave each heart\nof the certainty of success was the biggest asset of real wealth with\nwhich the colony began its history.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\nFOR THE CAUSE\n\n\nDuring the first enchanted days every man woman and child entered the\nstrange new system with a determination to see only its beauty, its\ntruth, its sure success. Service was the order of the day. Men who had\nnever before worked with their hands asked the privilege of the\nhardest tasks.\n\nThe whole colony swarmed to unload the ship. They refused to allow the\ncrew to touch a piece of freight or handle a piece of baggage.\n\nThe only difficulty Norman found was to systematize their work under\nthe captain's direction.\n\nThe day following they \"swarmed\" again to clear the lawn of weeds and\nrestore the labyrinth of walks and beds of flowers in the great court.\nMerchants exchanged the yardstick for the rake and hoe. Preachers laid\naside their sermons to wield a spade, and returned from their tasks in\nthe evening with song and laughter.\n\nAmong the women the spirit of sacrifice and enthusiastic service was\neven higher. Many who loved flowers begged the privilege of using the\npruning-knife and some even seized a hoe and worked with unwearied\nzeal.\n\nOthers, who had never seen the inside of their own kitchens, rolled up\ntheir sleeves, donned white aprons, entered the great cooking-room of\nthe hotel, and made pots and kettles fly. Beautiful girls who had\nspent lives of comparative ease took turns in waiting on the tables,\nand all worked with a spirit of joy which robbed labour of its\nweariness.\n\nBy common consent Norman had assumed the general directorship of the\ncolony, and by common consent the Wolfs were accepted as his chief\nadvisers. This arrangement was formally voted on and unanimously\napproved at the first night's assembly of the Brotherhood in the big\ndining-hall of the building, which they now christened the \"Mission\nHouse of the Brotherhood of Man.\"\n\nOn accepting the position of general manager of the Brotherhood the\nyoung leader rose and faced the people with deep emotion.\n\n\"Comrades,\" he began, in trembling tones, \"I thank you for the\nconfidence you have shown in me. I shall strive to prove myself worthy\nof your faith, and I hope within a year that we shall make such\nprogress in the development of our new social system that I shall be\nable to convey then the full title to this glorious island to your\npermanent organization.\"\n\nA round of applause greeted this announcement.\n\n\"I'm sure our preliminary work will be completed within a single year.\nI am not a man of many words, but I hope to prove myself a man of\ndeeds. I shall consult you in every important step to be taken, and\nfor this purpose the General Assembly of the Brotherhood will be held\nin this hall every Friday evening. On Monday evening a ball will be\ngiven for the pleasure of our young people, and every Wednesday\nevening a social reception. Let us make these three evenings the\nsource of inspiration for our daily tasks.\"\n\nNorman closed his brief speech in a burst of genuine enthusiasm.\nScores of young men and women crowded to the platform and grasped his\nhand.\n\nWhen the last echoes of the evening's celebration had died away,\nCatherine led Barbara into her room.\n\nWolf sat quietly smoking by the window.\n\n\"What on earth's the matter?\" the girl asked. \"You drag me to your\nroom half dressed, in the dead of night, and speak in whispers. I\nthought we'd done with the dark and scheming ways of the world.\"\n\n\"And so we have, my child,\" laughed Wolf. His cold gray eyes lighted\nwith sudden warmth as they rested on Barbara's dainty little figure.\nIts exquisite lines could be plainly seen through the silk kimono as\nshe walked with languid grace and threw the mass of dishevelled curls\nback from her shoulders.\n\n\"Sit down, dear,\" Catherine said, with a smile. \"We have something of\nthe utmost importance to say to you.\"\n\n\"I am to go abroad as an ambassador to some foreign court. Don't say\nthat--I like it here.\"\n\n\"No. We are going to propose that you establish a court here,\" Wolf\ninterrupted.\n\n\"Establish a court!\" Barbara exclaimed. \"How romantic!\"\n\n\"In short, my child, it's absolutely necessary for you to become, not\nmerely the power behind the throne with our young Comrade Chief, you\nmust assume the throne itself.\"\n\n\"But how?\" the girl asked.\n\n\"As if you didn't know!\"\n\n\"I honestly don't. My eloquence is of little use here. We are all\npersuaded. Besides, our Comrade Chief has acquired the habit of\nthinking for himself.\"\n\n\"Just so,\" observed Wolf. \"And we want you to do his thinking for\nhim.\"\n\n\"What do you mean, Catherine?\" Barbara asked, her brow suddenly\nclouding, as she looked straight into her foster-mother's eyes.\n\n\"That you must win young Worth.\"\n\n\"Deliberately set out to make him love me?\" the girl exclaimed with\nscorn. \"I'll do nothing of the kind.\"\n\n\"You must, my dear,\" Wolf pleaded earnestly. \"It's all for the Cause.\nIt's in this boy's power to make or wreck this great enterprise. We\nhave a kingdom here whose wealth and power may become the wonder of\nthe world. It may be wrecked by the whim of one man. A thousand\ndifficulties must be faced before we can have smooth sailing. The one\nthing above all to be done is to secure from young Worth the deed to\nthis island. He must be convinced of the success of the scheme, and he\nmust be convinced before he faces some of the most serious problems\nthat are sure to arise--problems which will demand a strong arm and a\ncool, clear head to handle. The boy means well, but he can never meet\nthese issues. Win his love and everything will be easy. Slowly and\npatiently I will perfect the organization we must have to succeed.\"\n\n\"I fail to see the necessity of such a shameless act on my part. No\nman here is so enthusiastic as our young leader. He is sure to make\nthe deed. You heard his promise to-night.\"\n\n\"He intends to do it, I grant,\" Catherine argued. \"But what Herman and\nI clearly see is that he will sooner or later be overwhelmed with\ndifficulties. He may quit in disgust at the very moment when a strong\npolicy could save the Cause. We want to be sure. He is a new convert.\nHis enthusiasm is now at white heat. We are afraid of what may happen\nwhen it cools.\"\n\n\"With your great brown eyes looking into his,\" Wolf broke in, \"and\nyour little hand in his, it can't cool!\"\n\n\"I don't think he cares for me in that way at all,\" the girl\nprotested. \"He has held himself quite aloof from me of late.\"\n\n\"All the more reason why your woman's pride should be piqued to make\nthe conquest,\" urged Wolf.\n\n\"I have no such vulgar ambitions,\" was the short answer.\n\n\"Of course you haven't, child,\" Wolf said in serious tones. \"We\nunderstand that. But we ask this of you as a brave little soldier of\nthe Cause. It's the one big, brave thing you can do.\"\n\n\"I might have to let him kiss me,\" she said, with a frown.\n\n\"Well, he's a handsome youngster--it wouldn't poison you,\" laughed\nCatherine.\n\n\"I hate it! I think I hate every man on earth sometimes,\" she\nanswered.\n\nWolf laughed and looked at her with quiet intensity.\n\n\"Come, dear, you can do this for the Cause we both love,\" Catherine\nurged.\n\n\"I might have to let him put his arm around me----.\"\n\nCatherine seized her hand, looked at her steadily for a moment, and\nslowly said:\n\n\"The woman who would not give both her body and her soul for the Cause\nof Humanity, if called on to make the sacrifice, is not worthy to live\nin the big world of which we've dreamed.\"\n\nBarbara's face flushed and her eyes sparkled.\n\n\"You believe this?\" she asked, sternly.\n\n\"With all my soul,\" was the fierce answer.\n\nBarbara hesitated a moment, and firmly said:\n\n\"Then I'll do it!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\nBARBARA CHOOSES A PROFESSION\n\n\nWhen Norman came down to the office next morning, the clerk handed him\na note. A glance at the smooth, perfect handwriting told him at once\nit was from Barbara. He opened it with a smile of pleasant surprise\nand read with increasing astonishment:\n\n        \"You are to take breakfast with me this morning in\n        the rose bower of the floral court.\n\n          \"By order of\n                    \"BARBARA BOZENTA,\n                  \"_Secretary to the General Manager_.\"\n\nNorman found her alone, seated beside a little table in the bower, her\nface wreathed in mischievous smiles.\n\nShe rose and extended her hand:\n\n\"Permit me to introduce you to your new secretary.\"\n\n\"I assure you my delight is only equalled by my surprise,\" he\nanswered, with boyish banter.\n\n\"Yes, I thought it best to take you by surprise. Now that it's all\nsettled, I trust we will get on well.\" She looked at him with demure\nand charming impudence.\n\nNorman burst into laughter.\n\n\"I'm sure we will!\" he answered. \"All I require is industry, patience,\nwisdom, tact, knowledge, sacrifice, absolute obedience, and a joyous\ndesire to assume full responsibility for my mistakes!\"\n\n\"All of which will come to me,\" she responded, with mock gravity.\n\"Permit me!\"\n\nShe led him to the chair she had placed beside the table, and poured a\ncup of coffee for him.\n\nNorman watched her with keen enjoyment. \"I've never seen you in this\nmood before,\" he said, quietly.\n\n\"You like it?\"\n\n\"Beyond words! I'm afraid I'll wake up directly and find I'm dreaming.\nI'm sure now, when I look into your eyes, sparkling with fun, that you\nare a flower nymph, and that your home has always been a rose bower on\nthe sunny slope of a southern hillside.\"\n\n\"Perhaps I'm just teasing you. Perhaps I won't work,\" she said,\nglancing at him from the corners of her brown eyes.\n\n\"Then you'll find it a serious joke,\" he answered, firmly.\n\"Resignations are not in order. You have chosen your profession. As\ngeneral manager I have given my approval. That settles it, doesn't\nit?\"\n\n\"If you are pleased, yes,\" she answered, gravely.\n\n\"I am more than pleased. I've been afraid to ask you to do this work\nfor me--though I've had it in mind.\"\n\n\"Why afraid?\"\n\n\"I don't know. I somehow got the impression lately that you didn't\nlike me personally.\"\n\n\"How could you think such a thing!\" she protested.\n\n\"Just a vague impression--caught, perhaps, from little gestures you\nsometimes made, little frowns that sometimes came to your brow, little\nflashes of hostility from your eyes.\"\n\n\"I didn't mean it, comrade!\" she said, demurely, while her eyes danced\nand her mouth twitched playfully.\n\n\"And you've fully weighed the cost?\"\n\n\"Fully.\"\n\n\"You know that you will be forced to spend most of your time in my\noffice?\"\n\n\"I'll try to endure it,\" she laughed.\n\n\"Without a frown or a hostile look?\"\n\n\"Unless you provoke it.\"\n\nNorman ate in silence for five minutes, listening to Barbara's girlish\nchatter while she bubbled over with the spirit of pure joy. Her whole\nbeing radiated fun and laughter as the sun pours forth heat and light.\nHe wondered where this magic secret of joyous womanhood had been\nhidden in the past.\n\n\"What a revelation you've been to me this morning,\" he said, musingly,\nas he rose from the table.\n\n\"How?\" she asked.\n\n\"I thought you were all seriousness and tragedy, eloquence and\npathos.\"\n\n\"We're in paradise now. The shadows have lifted.\"\n\n\"And I find you a little ray of dancing sunlight.\"\n\n\"So every girl would be if she had the chance.\"\n\n\"And we're going to give them the chance here, little comrade!\" he\ncried, with enthusiasm.\n\n\"I'll help you!\" she earnestly responded, extending her hand with a\ntender look into the depth of Norman's soul.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\nA CALL FOR HEROES\n\n\nThe first business before the Assembly of the Brotherhood was the\npermanent assignment of work. The enthusiasm which swept the\nSocialists through the first week of joyous life could not last. No\none expected it. The novelty of their surroundings, the surprise and\nelation of every one over the beauty and richness of their newly\nacquired empire, carried the pioneers over the opening days as in a\ndream. It all seemed like a great picnic--like the long-hoped-for\nholidays in life of which they had dreamed and never realized, yet\nwhich somehow had come to pass.\n\nBut the time was at hand to face the first big, sober reality of the\nnew social system. The dining-hall was packed. Every member of the\nBrotherhood was present.\n\nThe orchestra played a lively air in a vain effort to revive the\nspirit of festivity with which every meeting had hitherto buzzed.\n\nBut an evil spirit had entered the Garden of Eden, and joy had fled.\nOver every heart hovered a brood of solemn questions. What will be my\nlot? Will I be allowed to choose my work? Or will they tell me what to\ndo? Will it be dirty and disagreeable, or pleasant and inspiring?\n\nNorman sat in his chair of state as presiding officer, bending over a\nmass of papers which Barbara had spread before him. She leaned close,\nand a stray hair from one of her brown curls touched his forehead. He\ntrembled and stared blankly at the papers, seeing only a beautiful\nface.\n\n\"You understand?\" she asked. \"I've placed under each department the\nnumber of workers needed.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, I understand!\" he repeated, looking at her, blankly.\n\n\"I don't believe you've heard a word I've spoken to you,\" she said,\nreproachfully.\n\nHe was about to answer when the music stopped. Norman lifted his head\nwith a start, rose quickly and faced the crowd.\n\n\"Comrades,\" he began, \"the time has come for us to make good our faith\nin one another. You have proven yourselves brave and faithful in our\nstruggle with the infamies of the system of capitalism. We call now\nfor the heroes and heroines of actual work. We are entering, under the\nmost favourable auspices, on the most important experiment yet made in\nthe social history of the world. We are going to prove that mankind is\none vast brotherhood--that love, not greed, can rule this earth.\n\n\"In our temporary organization we wish to outline the forms on which\nwe will later found the permanent State of Ventura. At present we will\norganize four departments--Production, Distribution, Domestic Service,\nand Education.\n\n\"I am going to ask each one of you, by secret ballot, to choose your\npermanent work.\"\n\nA cheer shook the building.\n\nNorman flushed with pleasure, and continued quickly:\n\n\"It shall be my constant aim as your general manager under our\ntemporary organization to give you the widest personal liberty\nconsistent with the success of our enterprise.\n\n\"Before preparing your ballots for choice of your work, I shall have\nto ask that each head of a family and each unmarried man and woman\nfirst pass by the platform and draw lots for the assignment of your\nrooms in our Mission House. There have been some complaints already,\nI'm sorry to say, on this question. Some wish to live on the first\nfloor, some on the top, but everybody wants to live on the south side\nof the house with the glorious views of the sea, and nobody wishes to\nlive on the north side. There is but one way to determine such a\nquestion in our ideal state. Fate must decide.\n\n\"The numbers of each room and suite are in the basket. The bachelors\nwill be assigned to the right wing, the girls to the left wing, the\nmarried ones to the centre of the building.\n\n\"Please form in line on the left and march toward the right aisle past\nthe platform.\"\n\n\"Mr. Chairman!\" called Roland Adair, the Bard of Ramcat.\n\nNorman rapped for silence, and those who had risen resumed their\nseats.\n\n\"I protest, Mr. Chairman,\" continued the poet, \"against the cruelty of\nsuch a process. The weak and the aged should be given their choice\nfirst.\"\n\n\"We left them all behind us!\" Norman cried, with a wave of his hand.\n\"There are no weak and aged in this crowd. We belong to the elect. We\nhave found the secret of eternal youth.\"\n\nAnother cheer swept the crowd, the poet subsided with a sigh of\ncontempt, and the people quickly filed past the platform and drew\ntheir lots for permanent rooms in the building. The larger suites had\nbeen subdivided, so that the entire pioneer colony of two thousand\nfound accommodations under one roof.\n\nWhen the crowd had resumed their seats, and the last cry of triumph\nover a successful draw and the last groan of disappointment over an\nunlucky lot had subsided, Norman rose and made the most momentous\nannouncement the Brotherhood had yet heard:\n\n\"In the Department of Production we need hod-carriers, bricklayers,\ncarpenters, architects, teamsters, and skilled mechanics for the\nfoundry and machine-shops, saw-mill, and flour mills. On the farm and\norchard we need ploughmen and harvesters for grain and hay, gardeners,\nstablemen, and ditchers.\n\n\"In our Department of Domestic Service we need cooks, seamstresses,\nwasherwomen, scrubbers and cleaners, waiters, porters, bell-boys,\ntelephone girls, steamfitters, plumbers, chimney-sweeps, and sewer\ncleaners.\n\n\"In the Department of Education we need artists and artisans,\nteachers, nurses, printers and binders, pressmen and compositors, one\neditor, scientists and lecturers, missionaries, actors, singers, and\nauthors.\n\n\"Now you each of you know what you can do best. Choose the work in\nwhich you can render your comrades the highest service of which you\nare capable and best advance the cause of humanity. Write your name\nand your choice of work on the blanks which have been furnished you.\"\n\nThe orchestra played while the ballots were being cast and counted.\n\nThe chairman at length rose with the tabulated sheet in his hand and\nfaced his audience.\n\n\"Comrades,\" he said, with a twinkle in his eye, \"that old saying I'll\nhave to repeat, 'If at first you don't succeed, try, try again!'\nBeyond the shadow of a doubt we shall have to try this election again.\nIf I didn't know by the serious look on your faces that you mean it\nI'd say off-hand that you were trying to put up a joke on me.\"\n\nHe paused, and a painful silence followed.\n\n\"Give us the ballot!\" growled the Bard.\n\nNorman looked at the list he held, and in spite of himself, as he\ncaught the gleam of mischief in Barbara's eye, burst into laughter and\nsat down.\n\nWolf ascended the platform, glanced over the list and whispered:\n\n\"It's a waste of time. Call for the election of an executive council\nwith full powers.\"\n\n\"We'll try once more,\" Norman insisted, quickly rising.\n\n\"Comrades, I'm sorry to say there is no election. We must proceed to\nanother ballot, and if the industries absolutely necessary to the\nexistence of any society are not voted into operation, we must then\nchoose an executive council with full power to act. I appeal to your\nsense of heroism and self-sacrifice----\"\n\n\"Give us the ballot! Read it!\" thundered the offended poet.\n\n\"Yes, read it!\"\n\n\"Read it!\"\n\nThe shouts came from all parts of the hall. The crowd was in dead\nearnest and couldn't see the joke.\n\nOnce more the young chairman raised the fateful record of human\nfrailty before his eyes, paused, and then solemnly began:\n\n\"In the first place, comrades, more than six hundred ballots out of\nthe two thousand cast are invalid. They have been cast for work not\nasked for. They must be thrown out at once.\n\n\"Three hundred and sixty five able-bodied men choose hunting as their\noccupation. I grant you that game is plentiful on the island, but we\ncan't spare you, gentlemen!\n\n\"Two hundred and thirty-five men want to fish! The waters abound in\nfish, but we have a pound-net which supplies us with all we can eat.\n\n\"Thirty-two men and forty-six women wish to preach.\n\n\"We do not need at present hunters, fishermen, or preachers, and have\nnot called for volunteers in these departments of labour.\n\n\"Three hundred and fifty-six women wish to go on the stage, and one\nhundred and ninety-five of them choose musical comedy and light\nopera. I think this includes most of our female population between the\nages of fourteen and thirty-five!\"\n\nA murmur of excitement swept the feminine portion of the audience.\n\n\"Allow me to say,\" he went on, \"that the most urgent need of the\ncolony at this moment cannot be met by organizing a chorus, however\nbeautiful and pleasing its performances would be. We need, and we must\nhave, waitresses and milkmaids. The chorus can wait, the cows cannot.\n\n\"I asked for one editor. One hundred and seventy-five men and\nsixty-three women have chosen that field. Seventy-five men and\nthirty-two women wish to be musicians.\"\n\n\"We have looked in vain among the ballots for a single hod-carrier, or\nploughman, ditcher, cook, seamstress, washerman or washerwoman,\nstableman, scrubber, or cleaner. The Brotherhood cannot live a day\nwithout them. Remember, comrades, we are to make the great experiment\non which the future happiness of the race may depend. Let us forget\nour selfish preferences and think only of our fellow men. I call for\nheroes of the hod, heroines of the washtub and the scrubbing-brush and\nmilk-pail, knights of the pitchfork, spade, and shovel. Let hunters,\nfishermen, preachers, and chorus-girls forget they live for the\npresent.\n\n\"This is not a joke, comrades, though I have laughed. It's one of the\ngravest problems we must face. It has been suggested that we hire\noutside labour to do this disagreeable work for a generation or two.\nThe moment we dare make such a compromise we are lost forever. We must\nsolve this problem or quit. A second ballot is ordered at once.\"\n\nAgain the orchestra played, the ushers passed the boxes, the vote was\ntaken, and all for naught. Not a single hero of the hod appeared. Not\na single heroine of the washtub, the scrubbing-brush, or the\nmilk-pail.\n\nThe young chairman's face was very grave when Barbara handed him the\nresults.\n\nShe bent and whispered:\n\n\"Away with frowns and doubts and fears! There's a better way. A leader\nmust lead. Their business is to follow.\"\n\nNorman's face brightened. He turned to the crowd, and in tones of\nclear, ringing command announced:\n\n\"Comrades, I had hoped you could choose your work of your own accord.\nThe attempt has failed. Six divisions of labour, each of them\nabsolutely essential to the existence of society in any form above\nthe primitive savage, have not a single man or woman in them.\"\n\n\"We must elect an executive council of four who shall sit as a court\nof last resort in settling the question of the ability of each comrade\nand the work to which he shall be assigned. Under our temporary\ncharter the general manager will preside over this court and cast the\ndeciding vote. Nominations are in order for the other four. We want\ntwo men and two women in this council. In all our deliberations woman\nshall have equal voice with man.\"\n\nThe Bard made a speech of protest against the action about to be\ntaken, in the sacred name of liberty.\n\n\"This act is the first step on the road to a tyranny more monstrous\nthan any ever devised by capitalism!\" he shouted, with hands uplifted,\nhis long hair flying in wild disorder.\n\nTom Mooney, an old miner, who had met Norman and become his friend\nduring a visit to one of his father's mines, sprang to his feet and\nmade a rush for the excited poet. Confronting him a moment, Tom\ninquired:\n\n\"Kin I ax ye a few questions?\"\n\n\"Certainly. As many as you like.\"\n\n\"Kin ye cook?\"\n\n\"I cannot.\"\n\n\"Kin ye wash?\"\n\n\"No!\"\n\n\"Kin ye scrub?\"\n\n\"No, sir.\"\n\n\"Ever swing a hod?\"\n\n\"I have not.\"\n\n\"Ever milk a cow?\"\n\n\"No!\"\n\n\"Are ye willin' to learn them things?\"\n\n\"I didn't come here for that purpose.\"\n\n\"Then, what t' 'ell ye kickin' about?\" Tom cried, and, glaring at the\npoet, he thundered fiercely:\n\n\"Set down!\"\n\nThe man of song was so disconcerted by this unexpected onslaught, and\nby the roars of laughter which greeted Tom's final order, that he\ndropped into his seat, muttering incoherent protests, and the\nballoting for the executive council proceeded at once amid universal\ngood humour.\n\nA dozen names were proposed as candidates, and the four receiving the\nhighest votes were declared duly elected.\n\nThe election resulted in the choice of Herman Wolf, Catherine, Barbara\nBozenta, and Thomas Mooney.\n\nTom was amazed at his sudden promotion to high office, and insisted\non resigning in favour of a man of better education.\n\nNorman caught his big horny hand and pressed it.\n\n\"Not on your life, Tom. You've made a hit. The people like your hard\nhorse-sense. You will make a good judge. Besides, I need you. You're a\nman I can depend on every day in the year.\"\n\n\"I'll stick ef you need me, boy--but I hain't fitten, I tell ye.\"\n\n\"I'll vouch for your fitness--sit down!\"\n\nThe last command Norman thundered into Tom's ears in imitation of his\norder to the poet, and the old miner, with a grin, dropped into his\nseat.\n\nAs Norman was about to declare the meeting adjourned, the steward\nascended the platform and whispered a message.\n\nThe young leader turned to the crowd and lifted his hand for silence.\n\n\"Comrades, a prosaic but very important announcement I have to make. I\nhave just been informed that there is no milk for supper. The cows\nhave been neglected. They must be milked. I call for a dozen volunteer\nmilkmaids until this adjustment can be made. Come, now!--and a dozen\nyoung men to assist them. Let's make this a test of your loyalty to\nthe cause. All labour is equally honourable. Labour is the service of\nyour fellow man. Who will be the first heroine to fill this breach in\nthe walls of our defence?\"\n\nBarbara sprang forward, with uplifted head, laughing.\n\n\"I will!\"\n\n\"And I'll help you!\" Norman cried, with a laugh. \"Who will join us\nnow? Come, you pretty chorus-girls! You wouldn't mind if you carried\nthese milk-pails on the stage in a play. Well, this is the biggest\nstage you will ever appear on, and all the millions of the civilized\nworld are watching.\"\n\nA pretty, rosy-cheeked girl joined Barbara.\n\nAn admirer followed, and in a moment a dozen girls and their escorts\nhad volunteered. They formed in line and marched to the cow lot with\nNorman and Barbara leading, singing and laughing and swinging their\nmilk-pails like a crowd of rollicking children.\n\nWhen they reached the pasture where the cows were herded, Norman asked\nBarbara, with some misgivings:\n\n\"Honestly, did you ever milk a cow?\"\n\n\"Of course I have,\" she promptly replied. \"I spent two years on a farm\nonce. Do you think I'd make a fool of myself trying before all these\nkids if I hadn't?\"\n\n\"I didn't know but that you made a bluff at it to lead the others on.\nWhat can I do, for heaven's sake?\"\n\nNorman looked at her in a helpless sort of way while Barbara rolled up\nher sleeves. For the first time he saw her beautifully rounded bare\narm to its full length. He stood with open-eyed admiration. Never had\nhe seen anything so white and round and soft, so subtly and\nseductively suggestive of tenderness and love.\n\n\"For heaven's sake, what do I do?\" he repeated, blankly.\n\n\"Get some meal in that bucket for my cow, and see that her calf don't\nget to her--I'll do the rest.\"\n\nNorman hustled to the barn with the other boys, got his bucket of\nmeal, placed it in front of the cow Barbara had selected, and stood\nwatching with admiration the skill with which her deft little hands\npressed two streams of white milk into the bucket at her feet.\n\n\"Goodness, you're a wonder,\" he cried, admiringly. \"But where's the\ncalf I'm supposed to be watching?\"\n\n\"I think that's the one standing close to the gate in the next lot\nwatching me with envy. The first time the gate's opened he'll jump\nthrough if he gets half a chance--so look out!\"\n\n\"I'll watch him,\" Norman promised, without lifting his eyes from the\nrhythmic movement of the bare white arms.\n\nHe had scarcely spoken when a careless boy swung the gate wide open,\nand the lusty calf, whose soft eyes had been watching Barbara through\nthe fence, made a break for his mother. In a swift, silent rush he\nplanted one foot in Barbara's milk-pail, knocked her over with the\nother, switched his tail, and fell to work on his own account without\nfurther concern. It was all done so suddenly it took Norman's breath.\nHe sprang to Barbara's side and helped her to her feet.\n\nNorman grabbed the calf by the ear with one hand and by the tail with\nthe other, and started toward the gate.\n\nThe animal suddenly ducked his head, plunged forward, jerked Norman to\nhis knees, and dragged him ten yards before he could regain his feet.\nThe young leader rose, tightened his grip, and started with a rush\ntoward the gate, but the calf swerved in time to avoid it, gaining\nspeed with each step, and started off with his escort in a mad race\naround the lot, galloping at a terrific speed, bellowing and snorting\nat every jump.\n\nThe others stopped their work to laugh and cheer as round and round\nthe maddened little brute flew with the tall, heroic leader galloping\nby his side.\n\nNorman had no time to call for help. He couldn't let go and he\ncouldn't stop the calf.\n\nAs he made the second round of the lot, upsetting buckets, smashing\nmilk-pails, and stampeding peaceful cows, a boy yelled through the\nroars of laughter:\n\n\"Twist his tail! Twist his tail an' he'll go the way you want him!\"\n\nNorman misunderstood the order, loosened the head and grabbed the tail\nwith both hands. With a loud bellow the calf plunged into a wilder\nrace around the lot, dragging his tormentor now with regular, graceful\neasy jumps. He made the rounds twice thus, single file, amid screams\nof laughter, suddenly turned and plunged headlong through an osage\nhedge, and left Norman sitting in a dusty heap on the ground among the\nthorns. He rose, brushed his clothes sheepishly, and looked through\nthe hedge at the calf which had turned and stood eyeing him now with\nan expression of injured innocence.\n\nBarbara came up, wiping the tears of laughter from her eyes.\n\n\"I've learned something new,\" Norman quietly observed. \"All labour\nmay be equally honourable. It's not equally expedient. I wish you'd\nlook at that beast eyeing me through the fence! It's positively\nuncanny. I believe he's possessed of the devil. I don't wonder at that\nbelief of the ancients. I've tackled many a brute on the football\nfield--but this is one on me!\"\n\nThe brilliant young leader of the new moral world led the procession\nof milkmaids back to the house as the shadows of evening fell, a\nsadder but wiser man for the day's experience.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\nA NEW ARISTOCRACY\n\n\nThree members of the executive council, Norman, Barbara, and Tom,\nbegan at once the task of assigning work. The problems which\nimmediately faced the council were overwhelming, but they were urgent\nand could admit of no delay. The absolute refusal of every member of\nthe Brotherhood to do the dirty and disagreeable work brought at once\ntwo issues to a crisis. Either labour must be voluntary or\ninvoluntary. The people who did this work must be induced to agree to\nperform it or they must be forced to do it by a superior authority\nwithout their consent.\n\nThey could only be led to choose this work by inducements of an\nextraordinary nature--the payment of enormously high wages and the\nshortening of each day's work to a ridiculous minimum.\n\nIf wages were made unequal, the old problem of inequality would remain\nunsolved. For equal wages no man would lift his hand.\n\nConfronted by this dilemma the executive council decided at once to\nfix wages on an unequal basis rather than reduce its unwilling members\nto a condition of involuntary labour, which is merely a long way to\nspell slavery.\n\nWhen this decision was announced, Roland Adair, the Bard of Ramcat,\nonce more lifted his voice in solemn protest:\n\n\"I denounce this act in the name of every principle which has brought\nus together,\" he cried, with solemn warning. \"You have established a\nsystem far more infamous than the unequal wages of the old society\nwhere the law of the survival of the fittest is the court of last\nresort. You have opened the door of fathomless corruption by\nsubstituting the whim of an executive council for the law of nature.\nIt is the beginning of jealousy, strife, favouritism, jobbery, and\ninjustice.\"\n\n\"Then what's a better way?\" Old Tom asked, with a sneer.\n\n\"It's your business to find a better way,\" cried the man of visions.\n\nTom glared at the poet with a look of fury and Norman whispered to the\nold miner:\n\n\"Remember, Tom, you're sitting as a judge in the Supreme Court of\nState!\"\n\n\"Can't help it. I never did have no use for a fool. Ef he can't tell\nus a better way, let 'im shet up.\"\n\nBarbara pressed Tom's arm, and he subsided.\n\nThe court at once entered into the question of wages for domestic\nservice.\n\nIt had been agreed, at the suggestion of the Wolfs, that they should\nspend their time in quietly investigating the qualifications of each\nmember of the Brotherhood for the work to be assigned, and make their\nreports in secret to the majority of the court, which should sit\ncontinuously until all had been decided.\n\nNeither Norman, Barbara, nor the old miner suspected for a moment the\ndeeper motive which Wolf concealed behind this withdrawal from the\ndecision of these cases. They found out in a very startling way later.\n\nThe chief cook demanded a hundred dollars a month.\n\nOld Tom snorted with contempt. Norman smiled and spoke kindly:\n\n\"Remember, Louis, you only received $75 a month in San Francisco. Here\nthe Brotherhood provides every man with his food, his clothes, and his\nhouse. Wages are merely the inducement used to satisfy each individual\nthat labour may still be done by free contract, not by force.\"\n\n\"Well, it'll take a hundred a month to satisfy me,\" was the stolid\nreply. \"I didn't come here to cook. I could do that in the old hell we\nlived in. I came here to do better and bigger things. I can do them,\ntoo----\"\n\n\"But we've fixed the salary of the general manager at only\nseventy-five dollars a month, and you demand a hundred?\"\n\n\"I do, and if the general manager prefers my job, I'll trade with you\nand guarantee to do your work better than it's being done.\"\n\n\"Yes, you will!\" old Tom growled, as he leaned over Barbara and\nwhispered to Norman.\n\n\"Make it thirty dollars a month, and if he don't go to work--leave him\nto me, I'll beat him till he does it.\"\n\n\"No, we can't manage it that way, Tom. We must try to satisfy him.\"\n\n\"Hit's a hold-up, I tell ye--highway robbery--the triflin' son of a\ngun! Don't you say so, miss?\" Tom appealed earnestly to Barbara.\n\n\"We must have cooks, Tom--and we want everybody to be happy.\"\n\n\"Make him cook, make him--that's his business--I'd do it if I knowed\nhow. He's got to take what we give 'im. He can't git off this island.\nHe enlisted for five years. If he deserts, court-martial and shoot\nhim.\"\n\nIn spite of old Tom's bitter protest, Norman and Barbara succeeded in\npersuading the chief cook to accept eighty-five dollars a month--an\nadvance of ten dollars over the highest wages he had ever received\nbefore.\n\nWhen the eighteen assistant cooks lined up for the settlement of their\nwages a new problem of unexpected proportions was presented. They had\nlistened attentively to the case of the chef, and their chosen orator\npresented his argument in brief but emphatic words:\n\n\"We demand the exact wages you have voted the chef.\"\n\n\"Well, what do ye think er that?\" old Tom groaned to Norman. \"Hit's\njist like I told ye. Hit's a hold-up.\"\n\n\"We must persuade them, Tom,\" the young leader replied.\n\n\"Let me persuade 'em!\" the old miner pleaded.\n\n\"How?\" Barbara asked, with a twinkle in her brown eyes.\n\n\"I'll line 'em up agin that wall and trim their hair with my\nsix-shooter. I won't hurt 'em. But when I finish the job I'll\nguarantee they'll do what I tell 'em without any back talk. You folks\ntake a walk and make me Chief Justice fer an hour, and when you come\nback we'll have peace and plenty. Jest try it now, and don't you butt\nin. Let me persuade 'em!\"\n\nNorman shook his head.\n\n\"Keep still, Tom! We must reason with them.\"\n\n\"Ye 're wastin' yer breath,\" the miner drawled in disgust.\n\n\"Don't you think, comrades,\" Norman began, in persuasive tones, \"that\nyour demands are rather high?\"\n\n\"Certainly not,\" was the prompt reply. \"We come here to get equal\nrights. We don't want to cook. I'm a born actor, myself. I expected to\nplay in Shakespeare when I joined the Brotherhood. Anybody that wants\nthis job can have it. If we do your hot, dirty, disgusting,\ndisagreeable work while the others play in the shade we are going to\nget something for it.\"\n\n\"Even so,\" the young leader responded, \"is it fair that an assistant\ncook should receive equal wages with the chef?\"\n\n\"And why not? Labour creates all value. The chef's a fakir. We do all\nthe work. He never lifts his hand to a pot or pan. He struts and loafs\nthrough the kitchen and lords it over the men. Let him try to run the\nkitchen without us, and see how much you get to eat! We stand on the\nequal rights of man!\"\n\n\"But my dear comrade----\"\n\n\"Don't use them words,\" old Tom pleaded, \"jest let me make a few\nremarks----\"\n\nBarbara pinched Tom's arm and he subsided.\n\n\"Can't you see,\" Norman went on, \"that we are paying the chef for his\ndirective ability, for his inventive genius in creating new dishes and\nmaking old ones more delicious? You but execute his orders.\"\n\n\"We stand square on our principles. Labour creates all values. The\nchef never works. We make every dish that goes to the table. If it has\nany value we make it. We demand our rights!\"\n\nThe court agreed on fifty dollars a month, and the men refused to\nconsider it.\n\n\"We prefer to work in the fields, the foundry, the machine-shop, the\nmills, the forests, anywhere you like except the kitchen. Let the chef\ndo your work. Good day!\"\n\nThey turned and marched out in a body and sat down in the sunshine.\n\nIn vain Norman argued and pleaded. They stood their ground with sullen\ndetermination.\n\nA final clincher which the young leader could not evade always ended\nthe argument. The spokesman came back to it with dogged persistence:\n\n\"What did you mean, then, when you've been drumming into our ears that\nlabour creates all value? We do all the work, don't we?\"\n\nThe upshot of it was the eighteen assistant cooks marched back into\nthe hall, stood before the judges, and all were granted equal wages\nwith the chef.\n\nWhereupon the chef sprang to his feet and faced the court with blazing\neyes.\n\n\"You grant these chumps--these idiots--wages equal to mine? Not one of\nthem has brains enough to cook an egg if I didn't tell him how. Their\nwages equal to mine. I resign!\"\n\nTom spoke vigorously:\n\n\"Now will ye leave him to me?\"\n\nNorman and Barbara looked at each other in angry and helpless\namazement.\n\nThe old miner leaped to his feet, made his way down from the platform,\nand with two swift strides reached the chef. He leaned close and\nwhispered something in the rebel's ear. There was a moment's\nhesitation and the chef turned, signalled to his assistants, and amid\ncheers marched to the kitchen.\n\nTom resumed his seat beside Barbara with a smile, quietly saying:\n\n\"That's the way to do business, ladies and gentlemen!\"\n\n\"What did you say to him?\" Barbara asked.\n\n\"Oh, nothin' much,\" was the careless answer.\n\n\"I hope you didn't threaten him, Tom?\" Norman asked with some\nmisgiving.\n\n\"Na--I didn't threaten him. I spoke quiet and peaceable.\"\n\n\"But what did you tell him?\" the young leader persisted.\n\n\"I jest told him I'd give him two minutes ter git back ter the kitchen\nor I'd blow his head off!\"\n\n\"I'm afraid our table will feel the effects of that remark, Tom,\"\nBarbara said, doubtfully.\n\nNext to the question of cooks the most urgent issue to be settled was\nthe case of the scrubbers, cleaners, and drainmen. The women who had\nbeen assigned to the tasks of scrubbing the floors, washing the\nwindows and dishes, had watched the triumphs of the cooks with keen\nappreciation of their own power. It was easy to see that the more\ndisagreeable and disgusting the character of the work, the more\nextravagant the demands which could be made and enforced. The\nscrubbers and dishwashers boldly demanded one hundred dollars a month\nand six hours for a working day, and refused with sullen determination\nto argue the question.\n\nTo Barbara's mild and gentle protest their answer was complete and\nstunning:\n\n\"You have assigned us this dirty job. Do you want it at any price?\"\nasked their orator. \"I'll take yours without wages and jump at the\nchance.\"\n\nTom lost all interest in the proceedings and drew himself up in a knot\nin his chair. Now and then a growl came from the depths of his\nthroat.\n\nOnce he was heard to distinctly articulate:\n\n\"This makes me tired.\"\n\nThe court begged and pleaded, cajoled, argued in vain with the\nstubborn scrubwomen. Not an inch would they move in their demands. The\nfloors were becoming unspeakably filthy. They had not been scrubbed\nsince the arrival of the colony.\n\nNorman turned to Barbara.\n\n\"Put the question solemnly to ourselves--we don't want the job at any\nprice, do we?\"\n\n\"I couldn't do it!\" she admitted, frankly. \"Then what's the use? We\nmust be fair. It's worth what they ask.\"\n\nThe court granted the demands and the scrubwomen and dishwashers\nmarched to the kitchen and once more the chef tore his hair and cursed\nthe fate which brought him to such disgrace as to work with stupid\nsubordinates at equal wages and gaze on dishwashers and scrubwomen\nwhose wages exceeded his own.\n\nThe climax of all demands was reached when the drainman demanded a\nhundred and fifty dollars a month and four hours for each working day.\n\nNorman looked at him in dumb confusion. He knew what he was going to\nsay before he opened his mouth and he had no answer.\n\nThe drainman bowed low in mock humility, but the proud wave of his\nhand belied his words.\n\n\"My calling was a humble one in the old world, Comrade Judges,\" he\nsaid. \"I came here to climb mountain heights and find my way among the\nstars. You have sent me back to the sewers. I always felt that I had\nmissed my true calling. I've always wanted to be a poet----\"\n\nThe Bard shook his mane and groaned.\n\n\"I don't want this job at any price. But the sewers are choked. They\nhave not been cleaned for two years. It must be done. I've named my\nprice. I'll gladly yield to any man who envies my luck. If such a man\nis here let him speak--or forever hereafter hold his peace.\"\n\nWith a grandiloquent gesture the drainman swept the crowd with his\neye, but no man responded.\n\nThe court granted his demand.\n\nThe Bard leaped once more to his feet and entered his protest. This\ntime old Tom listened with interest. His concluding sentence rang with\nbitter irony:\n\n\"Against these absurd decisions I lift my voice once more in solemn\nprotest. We came to this charmed island to abolish all class\ndistinctions. You have destroyed the old classes based on culture,\nachievement, genius, wealth, and power. You have created a new\naristocracy on whose shield is emblazoned--a dish-rag and\nscrubbing-brush encircled by a sewer pipe! I make my most humble bow\nto our new king--the drainman! I hail the apotheosis of the\nscrubwoman!\"\n\n\"Say, you give me a pain--shut up\" thundered Tom.\n\nThe singer collapsed with a sigh and the crowd laughed.\n\nThe foreman of the farm brought two men before the court and asked for\nimportant instructions.\n\n\"Comrade Judges,\" he began, \"I had two men assigned to me a week ago\nwhom I don't want and won't have at any price. I return them to the\nBrotherhood with thanks. You can do what you please with them.\"\n\n\"What's the matter?\" Norman asked, with some irritation.\n\nThe foreman shoved and kicked a man in front of the judges.\n\n\"This fool----\"\n\n\"You must not use such language, Mr. Foreman,\" Barbara interrupted.\n\n\"I beg your pardon, Comrade Judges,\" he apologized. \"This coyote I put\non a mowing-machine yesterday. He said he knew how to run it. He broke\nit on a smooth piece of ground the first hour. I gave him another and\nhe wrecked it before noon. It will take the labour of five men two\ndays to repair the damage he has done. I don't want him at any price.\"\n\n\"What have you to say?\" Norman asked the accused.\n\n\"It wasn't my fault. The thing broke itself.\"\n\n\"But how did it happen twice the same day, sonny?\" Tom asked.\n\n\"I dunno. Hit jist happened,\" was the dogged answer.\n\n\"I've another scoundrel----\"\n\n\"You must not use such language,\" Barbara broke in.\n\n\"Again begging the pardon of Comrade Judges,\" the foreman continued:\n\"This dog\"--he kicked another slovenly looking lout before the\njudges--\"tore to pieces the shoulders of two pairs of horses with\ncareless harnessing before I found him and kicked him out of the\nstables. Those four horses can't work for a month. We'll have to pay\nat least $500 for two teams right away to take their places, or lose a\ncrop of hay.\"\n\nTom glared at the culprit.\n\n\"What did ye ruin them horses' shoulders fer?\"\n\n\"I didn't know it,\" was the sulking answer.\n\n\"He's a liar!\" cried the foreman. \"He put the same collars on their\ngalled necks three days in succession and beat them unmercifully when\nthey couldn't pull the load.\"\n\n\"What do you say, Tom?\" Norman asked.\n\nThe old miner glared at the last culprit and his grim mouth tightened:\n\n\"Wall, you kin do as ye please, but any man that'll abuse a hoss will\ncommit murder. I'd put the fust one in the cow lot to shovellin'\ncompost. This one I'd quietly lynch--no public rumpus about it--jest\ntake 'im down by the beach, hang 'im to one of them posts on the pier,\nshoot 'im full of holes, and drop 'im into the sea to be sure he don't\ncome back to life.\"\n\nNorman conferred with Barbara a moment and rendered the decision:\n\n\"Mr. Foreman, the first man is transferred from the field machinery to\nthe compost-heap in the barnyard. The second man who disabled the\nhorses will assist in cleaning the sewers. Their wages will remain the\nsame as before.\"\n\nA round of applause greeted this decision.\n\nThe Bard renewed his attack with unusual zeal. Standing before the\ncourt and shaking his long hair he cried:\n\n\"At last the climax of tyranny! Two comrades condemned without a jury\nand without defense! I congratulate you. In one day you have\nestablished an aristocracy of filth and created a penal colony without\na hearing or appeal. We are making progress.\"\n\nThe old miner grunted, Barbara smiled tenderly at Norman, and the\ncourt adjourned.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX\n\nSOME TROUBLES IN HEAVEN\n\n\nNorman found it necessary for the executive council to sit\ncontinuously for the adjustment of disputes and the settlement of new\nproblems which arose at every step of progress in the new moral world.\n\nHe had condemned the sins of the old world of capitalism with cocksure\ncertainty. Now that he had been made a supreme judge with power to\nadjust the rights and wrongs of his fellow man, he was appalled at the\nmagnitude of the task of substituting an ideal for the reign of\nnatural law under which civilization had been slowly evolved.\n\nThere were two men in the Brotherhood whom he grew early to hate with\ncordial, thorough, murderous hatred--Roland Adair, the Bard of Ramcat,\nwho always denounced every decision as unjust, and a tall,\nhooked-nosed, stoop-shouldered, scholarly looking man named Diggs, who\ninvariably sat near him and at every conceivable opportunity asked\nquestions. These questions were always put in an innocent, friendly\nway, but when Diggs looked at him through his gleaming spectacles\nNorman always got the impression that an imp of the devil had suddenly\npopped up through the floor.\n\nThe first day after the general assignment of work Diggs rose before\nthe council, adjusted his glasses, and drew a piece of paper from his\npocket. Norman knew before he spoke that the document bristled with\nquestions. Diggs's glasses had always fascinated him, but to-day they\nseemed of unusual thickness and enormous size, and their concave\nsurfaces seemed to flash light from a thousand angles.\n\nDiggs adjusted them on his hook-nose with deliberation and glanced\ncarefully over his notes before speaking.\n\nNorman turned to Barbara with a sigh.\n\nShe pressed his hand in silent sympathy.\n\n\"Don't worry!\" she whispered.\n\nNorman's breath quickened as he answered the pressure of the soft,\nwarm fingers but he managed to move his chair and break the effects of\nher spell without revealing to her the effort it cost. Each hour of\ntheir association he felt the cords he dare not try to break tighten\nabout his heart. He determined each day to put the thought from him.\nOver and over again with grim resolution he repeated his vow:\n\n\"I'll keep a clear head. I've got to decide this issue on its merits.\nI owe it to my generous friends who made it possible.\"\n\nHe had avoided her for the last few days. She guessed the cause\nintuitively and knew that he was fighting with desperation to escape\nthe net she was slowly weaving about him. She began to watch the\nstruggle now with a curious fascination in which cruelty and\ntenderness were equally mixed. The idea of surrendering her own heart\nhad never once entered her pretty head.\n\nHer life had been lived in a strange war with human society. Man had\nalways appeared to her imagination as an enemy. She had never trusted\none--least of all Wolf, the big, impassive animal who had dominated\nthe life of her foster-mother.\n\nWith deliberate and cruel art she had set out to master the heart of\nthe man who sat by her side. The task was accepted as part of her\nwork. She had enlisted as a soldier in the Cause. She had received the\norders from headquarters. When the deed was done she would turn to a\ngreater task. She had expected to be bored by his idiotic love making.\nNow her curiosity was beginning to be piqued by his silence. She began\nvaguely to wonder each moment what kind of pictures she was making in\nhis mind. Her brown eyes searched the depths of his soul in a dumb way\nthat sent the blood rushing to Norman's heart, but each time he had\neluded her.\n\nHe sat in moody silence now, giving no response to her words of cheer.\nShe roused him from his reverie with a plaintive protest.\n\n\"What's the matter? Have I, too, offended?\"\n\nHe turned quickly and crushed her hand in his strong grasp:\n\n\"For heaven's sake don't _you_ get into the habit of asking me\nquestions! How could you offend? Your face is my lighthouse set on the\ncliffs, calm, serene, joyful. I couldn't get through a day without\nyou.\"\n\nA smiling answer was just trembling on her lips when Diggs began to\nspeak.\n\n\"Now for the human interrogation point,\" Barbara laughed.\n\n\"Comrade Judges,\" Diggs began, with guileless good humour, \"while we\nare shaping the form of our ideal State for its permanent organization\nI wish to submit some questions which may help us in our search for\ntruth.\"\n\n\"Questions,\" Norman whispered, \"which any fool can ask, but the angels\nof God can't answer.\"\n\n\"But we will answer them!\" she flashed, with defiant courage.\n\n\"We agree,\" Diggs went on, \"that society must be governed in some way.\nThere must be rulers, but how shall we choose our rulers, and with\nwhat powers shall we clothe them? We can begin to see that the head of\nour social system must at times exercise the full powers of the State.\nInto whose hands can this enormous power be entrusted, and how shall\nhe be called to account?\"\n\nDiggs paused, and Norman flushed at this question, for he took it as a\npersonal thrust. He had occasion to change his mind later.\n\n\"How can we,\" the questioner went on, \"retain our democratic liberties\nas law makers as we grow in numbers? Now we can all meet in general\nassembly. When the State numbers even five thousand this will not be\npossible. Will not our politics become even more corrupt than the old\nsystem, seeing how enormous the power over the smallest details of\nlife which these legislators possess?\n\n\"As our society grows--and thousands are now clamouring for\nadmission--how is wealth to be distributed? Who shall determine, in\nthis larger society, who shall be common labourers, who poets,\nartists, musicians, preachers, managers? Who shall appoint editors?\nAnd who shall call them to account if they publish treason against the\nState? What shall be done with the ever-increasing number of the\nlazy, dishonest, and criminal members of the community?\n\n\"Who shall determine how much mental work is equivalent to so much\nmanual labour, seeing how vast is the difference in the value of one\nman's brain product over another's? How can men who are not artists,\npoets, or musicians determine the value of such work? Or how can one\npoet be just to his rival if he be made the judge? When our theatre is\nopened, who shall select the actors? Who shall decide whether they are\nincompetent? Who shall decide on the selection of the star? What shall\nbe done with an actor, for example, who should spit in the face of a\njudge deciding adversely? Suppose a man offends the judge? Shall he be\npunished? If so, who shall do it?\n\n\"How can we prevent a man from losing his wages playing poker with his\nneighbour if he does so joyfully?\n\n\"What shall be done with a man who works outside regular hours and\naccumulates a vast private fortune?\"\n\n\"Say, ain't you worked your jaw overtime now?\" old Tom broke in\nrudely. \"We'll take them things up when we come to 'em. We got\nsomethin' else to do now--set down!\"\n\n\"These are only friendly suggestions for thought as we develop our\nideal,\" Diggs answered, with smiling good nature, as he resumed his\nseat.\n\n\"What makes me want to kill that man,\" Norman muttered to Barbara, \"is\nthe unfailing politeness and unction with which he asks those\nquestions.\"\n\n\"Patience! patience!\" was the low, musical reply. \"These little things\nwill all adjust themselves.\"\n\nMethodist John pressed to the front and poured out to the judges a\nstory of wrong and asked for justice.\n\n\"Miss Barbara,\" he began, in plaintive tones, \"you was always good to\nme in the other world, but since we've got here even you don't seem\nthe same. Everybody's hard and cold. They hain't got no sympathy here\nfor a poor man. In the other world I missed my callin'--I was born for\nthe ministry. I come here to serve the Lord. And now they make me work\nso hard I ain't even got time to pray. I ask for a licence to preach\nthe gospel. Just give me a chance. They've put me to feedin' hogs and\ntendin' ter calves. I ain't fit for such work. I want to call sinners\nto repentance, not swine to their swill. I tell ye I've been buncoed.\nIt ain't a square deal. I left the poorhouse to come with you to\nheaven and, by gum, I've landed in the workhouse----\"\n\n\"And ef yer don't shet up and git back ter yer work,\" Tom thundered,\n\"you'll land in the hospital--you hear me!\"\n\n\"I ain't er talkin' to you, you cussin, swearin', ungodly son of the\ndevil,\" the old man answered.\n\n\"Come, come, John,\" Norman interrupted, as he held Tom back. \"We can't\ngrant your request. We are not ready to undertake religious work yet.\"\n\n\"Well, God knows ye need it!\" John muttered, as the crowd pushed him\naway.\n\nAt the door Catherine greeted him as he passed out, whispered\nencouraging words, and sent him back to his tasks more cheerful. She\nhad taken her stand thus each day; and, while Wolf was busy quietly\nmingling with the men outside getting the facts as to the progress of\neach department, the tall graceful woman of soft voice and madonna\nface was fast becoming the friend and sympathizer of each discontented\nworker. She had now assumed the task of peacemaker after each harsh\ndecision had been rendered, and did her work with rare skill--a skill\nwhich promised big results in the dawning State of Ventura.\n\nUncle Bob Worth, an old Negro, bowed low before the judges. He had\nbeen a slave of Norman's grandfather in North Carolina and had joined\nthe colony out of admiration for the young leader.\n\n\"Marse Norman,\" he solemnly began.\n\n\"Don't call me 'master,' Bob,\" Norman interrupted. \"Remember that we\nare all comrades here.\"\n\n\"Yassah! Yassah! Marse Norman, I try to 'member dat sah, but 'pears\nter me dey's somefin' wrong bout dis whole 'comrade' business, sah!\nI'se er 'comrade' now but I'se wuss off dan I eber wuz. 'Fo' I come\nhere I wuz er butler, and I wuz er gemmen--yas-sah, ef I do hat ter\nsay it myself--and I allus live wid gemmens an' sociate wid gemmens. I\ncome out here wid you ter be a white man an' er equal. Dat's what dey\nall say. I be er equal 'comrade.' I make up my mind dat I jine de\nminstrel band, pick de banjer, an' sing de balance er my life. Bress\nGod, what happen. Dey make me a hod-carrier and make me 'sociate wid\nlow-down po' white trash. I ain't come here ter be no 'comrade' wid\ndem kin' er folks. Dey ain't my equal, sah, an' I can't 'ford to\n'sociate wid 'em. What's fuddermo, sah, carryin' a hod ain't my\nbusiness--hit don't suit my health an' brick-dust ain't good fur my\ncomplexion, sah!\"\n\nTom grunted contemptuously.\n\nNorman smiled and shook his head.\n\n\"Sorry, Comrade Bob,\" he replied. \"We haven't men enough to organize\nthe minstrels yet. We must rush the new building. We have thousands\nof new members clamouring to join. We have nowhere to house them.\"\n\n\"Yassah, an' I 'spec' dey'll be clamourin' ter unjine fo' long,\" old\nBob muttered, as he passed on to be comforted by Catherine's soothing\nwords.\n\nSaka, the Indian, whom Colonel Worth had educated, had followed\nNorman. He demanded a return ticket to the Colonel's hunting lodge.\n\nIt was promptly refused. Catherine attempted to soothe his ruffled\nfeelings. He snapped his fingers in her face and grunted.\n\nThe Brotherhood of Man saw Saka no more for many moons, but the crack\nof his rifle was heard on the mountain side and the smoke of his tepee\ncurled defiantly from the neighbouring plains.\n\nThe chef appeared before the court in answer to numerous complaints\nabout the table.\n\n\"I must have the law laid down for the tables, Comrade Judges,\" he\ndemanded. \"One man wants one thing and another refuses to eat at the\ntable where such food is served. A dozen men and women ask only for\nbread, vegetables, and nuts. They refuse to eat meat. They refuse to\nallow me to cook it or any one else to eat it if they can help it.\nThey make my life miserable. I want permission to kick them out of the\nkitchen. They demand the right to inspect my pots and pans to see if\nmeat has touched them. They must go or I go. I will not be insulted by\nfools. If you do not give me permission to kick these people out of\nthe kitchen I will do so without permission. You can take your\nchoice.\"\n\nThe cook mopped his brow and sat down with a defiant wave of his arm.\n\nA woman who had been a leader of the W.C.T.U. pressed forward before\nthe cook's demand could be considered.\n\n\"And I demand in the name of truth, purity, righteousness, justice,\nfaith, and God, that no more wine be allowed on the table. I demand\nthat we burn the wine house and issue an order to the cook never\nagain, under penalty of imprisonment for life, to use a drop of\nalcohol in the food he serves to the Brotherhood----\"\n\n\"And I also demand, Comrade Judges,\" the cook interrupted, \"the right\nto throw that woman out of the kitchen and have her fined and\nimprisoned the next time she dares to interfere with my business. She\ngot into the pantry yesterday and destroyed five hundred mince pies\nbecause she smelled brandy in them.\"\n\n\"Yes, and I'll do it again if you dare to poison the bodies and souls\nof my comrades with that hellish stuff!\" she cried, triumphantly.\n\n\"I'd like to know,\" the cook shouted, \"how I'm to do my work if every\nfool in creation can butt into my business?\"\n\n\"Softly! Softly!\" Norman warned.\n\n\"I mean it!\" thundered the chef. \"This woman swears she will wreck the\ndining-room if I dare to place wine again on our bill of fare. I want\nto know if she's in command of this colony? If so, you can count me\nout!\"\n\n\"And while we are on this point, Comrade Judges,\" spoke up a\nmild-looking little man, \"I have summoned a neighbour of mine to\nappear before you and show cause why he should _not_ cease to have\nsauerkraut served at breakfast. He sits at my table. I've begged him\nto stop it. I've begged the cook to stop cooking the stuff, but he\nbribes the cook----\"\n\n\"That's a lie,\" shouted the chef.\n\n\"I saw him do it, your honours,\" the little man went on. \"I'm a\nsmall-sized man or I'd lick him. I tried to move my seat but they\nwouldn't let me. I pledge you my word when he brings that big dish of\nsteaming sauerkraut to our table it fogs the whole end of the\ndining-room. The odour is so strong it not only stops you from eating,\nyou can't think. It knocks you out for the day.\"\n\n\"Is it possible,\" Norman inquired, \"that there is a human being among\nus who eats sauerkraut for breakfast?\"\n\n\"There's no doubt about it, comrade,\" promptly responded a tall,\nstrapping-looking fellow, with a dark, scholarly face, as he stepped\nto the front.\n\n\"That's him!\" cried the little accuser. \"I made him come. Told him I'd\norganize a party to lynch him if he didn't. He won't dare deny it. I\ncan prove it.\"\n\n\"I have no desire to deny that I eat sauerkraut, you little ape,\" he\nreplied with scorn. \"I come of German ancestry, comrades. My\ngreat-grandfather helped to create this nation. He was a pure-blooded\nGerman. I inherit from him my personal likes and dislikes. Sauerkraut\nis the best breakfast food ever served to man. It is a pure vegetable\nmalt. It is wholesome, clean, healthful, and keeps the system of a\nbrain worker in perfect order. I eat it with ham gravy and good hot\nwheat biscuits. It is some trouble for the cook to prepare this\nparticular kind of soft tea-biscuit for me. I paid him a little extra\nfor this bread--not the kraut. I suggest to your honours that you make\nsauerkraut a standard breakfast diet as a health measure. They may\nkick a little at first, but I assure you it will improve the health\nand character of the colony. If this little chap who accuses me were\nput on a diet of kraut for breakfast it might even now make a man of\nhim. I not only have nothing to apologize for, I bring you good\ntidings. I proclaim sauerkraut the only perfect health food for\nbreakfast, and I suggest its compulsory use. The man who sits next to\nme eats snails. I think the habit a filthy and dangerous one. If you\nare going into this question, do it thoroughly. Let us fix by law what\nis fit to eat, and stick to it. I'll back sauerkraut before any\ndietary commission ever organized on earth.\"\n\nThe council appointed a commission to conduct hearings and make a\nrigid code of laws establishing the kind of foods for each meal.\n\nAgain Roland Adair, the Bard of Ramcat, rose, shook his long hair and\ncleared his throat.\n\nNorman lifted his hand for silence.\n\n\"I anticipate the poet's words. You solemnly protest against the\nfurther establishment of a tyranny which shall dare prescribe your\nfood from day to day. I grieve over the necessity of these laws and\nmingle my tears with yours in advance. But, in the language of a\ndistinguished citizen of the old republic, 'we are confronted by a\ncondition, not a theory.' The council stands adjourned.\"\n\nThe Bard poured his bitter protest into Catherine's patient ears and\nleft with a growing conviction of her wisdom.\n\nThe woman with the drooping eyelids stood watching his retreating\nfigure while a quiet smile of contempt played about her full, sensuous\nlips.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX\n\nTHE UNCONVENTIONAL\n\n\nWithin a week it was necessary to appoint a commission to formulate an\nelaborate code of laws regulating various nuisances which had\ndeveloped in the community.\n\nA kitchen-boy insisted on playing a cornet in his room. He didn't know\na musical from a promissory note but he swore he'd become a musician\nbefore he died. His efforts came near proving fatal to his neighbours\nbefore he was suppressed.\n\nSeveral women had pet parrots. The people who lived near by\nstrenuously objected. The parrots had to go.\n\nA sailor had brought a monkey whose manners were not appreciated by\nany one except his master. The monkey had to go. Cats were arraigned\nfor trial and a fierce battle raged over the question of allowing them\nin the building. The question was finally put to the popular vote in\nthe assembly and the cats won by a good majority. But strict laws\nregulating the kind of cats, their number, and their care, were put\ninto force.\n\nDogs won by a large majority when they were finally put on trial.\n\nThe commission on nuisances had finally to make a code of laws\nregulating table manners and the conduct of all social gatherings.\n\nThe one question which all but precipitated a civil war was the\nproblem of dress. Inequality of wages meant, of necessity, inequality\nof dress.\n\nA desperate effort was made by a large number to force the community\nto adopt a uniform for both men and women. It was fiercely opposed.\nEvery woman who believed herself good looking refused to listen to any\nargument on the subject.\n\nIt was necessary at once, however, to formulate some sort of code. A\nnumber of men had been coming into the dining-room in their shirt\nsleeves. Some of them apparently never combed their hair or changed\ntheir linen. A number of women had gotten into the habit of coming\ninto the dining-room in loose wrappers of variegated colors and\nwithout corsets.\n\nThe Bard of Ramcat was particularly severe in his public criticism of\nthese women in the general assembly of the Brotherhood.\n\n\"In the name of beauty, I protest!\" he cried. \"Beauty is an attribute\nof God. It is woman's first duty to be beautiful, and if she isn't, at\nleast to make man think she is. I insist that she shall have the\nwidest liberty in the choice of dress. Only let her be careful that\nshe is beautiful!\"\n\nThe poet was heartily applauded, and a resolution was passed which\nembodied his ideas, approving the widest freedom of choice in dress,\napproving especially unconventional forms of dress, provided always\nthe ideal of beauty was held inviolate.\n\nIn his speech advocating the immediate passage of the resolution the\nBard urged every woman to outdo herself in the struggle for supreme\nbeauty of appearance at the weekly ball on Friday evening.\n\nHis resolutions and speech bore surprising fruit.\n\nWhen the festivities were at their height a crowd of fifteen pretty\ngirls suddenly swept into the brilliantly lighted ball-room in tights!\nThe sensation was so instantaneous and overwhelming the music stopped\nwith a crash. The orchestra thought somebody had yelled fire.\n\nThe girls in their beautiful but unconventional dress tried to appear\nunconcerned. But even the Bard was appalled at the results.\n\nThe pretty young chorus-girls had taken him at his word. They had\nalways cherished a secret desire to live in an unconventional real\nworld, where they could have a chance to be themselves, without the\nhideous skirts of conventional society veiling their beauty. They had\nbrought these costumes with them and joined the new moral world in the\nfirm faith that their ideal would be realized. It had come very\nslowly, but it had come at last.\n\nThey donned their beautiful costumes with hearts fluttering in\ntriumphant pride. But they had huddled into a corner of the ball-room\nin a panic of fright at the insane commotion their honest efforts to\npromote beauty had caused. One by one every woman in skirts save\nBarbara and Catherine left the room. The married ones seized their\nhusbands and pushed them out ahead.\n\nNorman, who was dancing with Barbara, broke down and burst into a\nparoxysm of laughter.\n\nSome of the girls began to cry, but others made a brave effort to face\nthe crowd of eager, giggling boys who pressed nearer.\n\nThe Bard approached with a serious look on his noble brow,\ndeliberately put on his glasses and surveyed the crowd.\n\n\"My dear girls,\" he began, \"I thank you from the bottom of my heart\nfor the sincerity and honesty of your efforts to express beauty in\nunconventional form, but really this is beyond my wildest\nexpectation.\"\n\nCatherine drove the rude boys out of the room and closed the windows,\nwhile Barbara kissed the tears away from the hysterical innovators and\nled them back to their rooms.\n\nThe next morning the general assembly held an unusually solemn meeting\nat which it was voted by a large majority to settle at once and\nforever the question of dress by adopting a Socialist uniform of\nscarlet and white for the women, and for the men a dull gray suit with\nscarlet bands on the sleeve, a scarlet stripe and belt for the\ntrousers.\n\nThe discussion was brief and Roland Adair, the Bard of Ramcat,\nprotested in vain.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI\n\nA PAIR OF COLD GRAY EYES\n\n\nFrom the night of the ball at which the group of chorus-girls made\ntheir sensational entrance in tights, Norman had his hands full.\nDisorder had rapidly grown in the Brotherhood. Two distinct parties\nbegan to line up for a desperate struggle for supremacy, the one\nstanding for the widest liberty of the individual members of the\ncommunity, the other demanding the stern enforcement of law and order\nand the formulation of a complete and strict code of rules for the\ngovernment of daily conduct.\n\nAmong the men assigned to various tasks there gradually appeared a\nnumber who slighted their work. From carelessness they drifted into\nutter incompetency and downright laziness. Groups of these loafers\nbegan to hang around the house daily.\n\nWhen they had spent the last penny of their credit at the general\nstore of the community, they began to steal. Not a day or night passed\nbut complaints of thefts were made from every department of the\ncolony. One of the most serious of these burglaries was the robbery\nof the winery of an enormous quantity of the most valuable wines.\n\nDrunkenness had already become one of the serious problems of the\nBrotherhood, and the right to buy of the steward had been denied a\nlarge number of men and several women. These people began at once to\nshow signs of intoxication. It was plain that the thieves had hidden\nthis wine and that they were carrying on a secret traffic with those\nto whom it had been forbidden.\n\nWith the increase of reckless drunkenness another evil grew with\nalarming rapidity, the carousing of boisterous men and women. One of\nthem very quickly passed the limits of tolerance. She was in many\nrespects the most beautiful girl in the colony, barely nineteen years\nold, with luxuriant blond hair, and big, wide, staring baby-blue eyes.\nShe had with it all a smile so saucy, so winsome, so elfish, and yet\nso innocent, it was impossible for the average man or woman to think\nill of her. To every appeal of Barbara she merely showed her pretty\nwhite teeth in a winsome smile, promised her anything she asked, and\nproceeded to do as she liked.\n\nAt last her room was declared an intolerable nuisance by a committee\nappointed to enter the complaint on behalf of her neighbours on the\nfloor on which she lived. The night before this committee appealed to\nBarbara two boys had fought a desperate fist duel in this room. The\nnoise had roused the neighbours, and the case could no longer be\nignored by the executive council.\n\nBarbara was sent to this room with full power to deal with the\noffender.\n\n\"Good heavens,\" cried the girl, her big blue eyes opening wide with\ninjured innocence, \"how could I help it? They're both in love with me.\nI don't care a rap for either one of them, but they got to fighting,\nand I couldn't stop them. I threw a pitcher of water on them, but they\nkept right on. I'd have called the police, but there was none to call.\nIt wasn't my fault.\"\n\n\"But my dear Blanche,\" pleaded Barbara, \"can't you see that you are\nbringing scandal and disgrace into the colony?\"\n\n\"It's not me!\" the pretty lips pouted. \"It's these old women who are\ntalking. Let them shut their mouths and attend to their own business.\nI'm not bothering them.\"\n\n\"You deny the accusations they bring against your good name?\" Barbara\nsaid, with some surprise.\n\n\"Of course I deny them,\" she snapped. \"I've got to have some fun,\nhaven't I? I can't help it that a dozen boys come to see me and nobody\never sees the old tabbies who lie about me, can I? I can't help it\nthat they are old and ugly, can I?\"\n\nBarbara had ceased to listen to the glib tongue, whose lying chatter\ntired her. She looked about the room with increasing amazement. It was\nstuffed with presents of every conceivable description. Costly rugs\nadorned the floor. Soft pillows filled the couch by the window. Dainty\nand expensive works of art adorned her mantel, and the richest and\nmost beautiful underwear lay in a smoothly laundered pile on her\nluxuriant bed.\n\n\"And how did you get all these costly and beautiful things, my dear?\"\nBarbara asked, with a touch of sarcasm.\n\nThe big blue eyes opened wide again with wonder.\n\n\"Why, the boys who are in love with me gave them. Why shouldn't they?\nI can't help it that they are foolish, can I? God made them so.\"\n\n\"And you accepted these rich and costly things in perfect innocence of\nthe evil meaning others might put on them?\"\n\n\"Of course! How can I keep their tongues from wagging? Life's too\nshort. I have but one life to live. I can't waste it worrying over\nnothing.\"\n\nFor the first time in her career Barbara stood face to face with naked\nevil--with a liar to whom a lie was good--a radiantly beautiful girl\nto whom shame was sweet.\n\nFor a moment the thought was suffocating. She looked out of the window\nat the infinite blue sea until the tears slowly blinded her. The first\ndoubt of her theory of life crept into her heart and threw its shadow\nover the ideal of the new world she had built.\n\nShe took the girl's hand, slipped her arm around her neck, kissed the\nsoft, shining hair, and sobbed:\n\n\"Poor little foolish sister! I'm afraid you've broken my heart\nto-day.\"\n\n\"I haven't done a thing! Honestly, I haven't!\" the lusty young liar\nrattled on and on, in a hundred silly, vain protests, which Barbara\nnever heard.\n\nShe left the room at length with a sickening sense of defeat, though\nthe girl had promised her on the honour of her soul never again to\ngive the slightest cause for complaint.\n\nMany a day she had trudged through the streets of the great city,\nafter hours of nerve-racking struggles with sin and shame and despair\nin the old world, but she had always come home at night with a heart\nsinging a battle-hymn of victory. She knew the cause of all the pain,\nand she had given her life to right the wrong. Nothing daunted her,\nnothing disconcerted her. In the end triumph was sure, and while she\nfelt this there could be no such thing as failure.\n\nShe stood before the full meeting of the executive council, honestly\nreported the case, and for the first time tasted the bitterness of\ndefeat, helpless, complete, and overwhelming. While she was talking a\npeculiar expression in Wolf's cold gray eyes suddenly caught her\nattention and fixed her gaze on him with a curious fascination and\nhorror. Wolf was quick to note her look, recovered himself and smiled\nin his old fatherly, friendly way.\n\n\"Don't worry, comrade. We've got to meet and settle such questions.\nThey are merely the inheritance of civilization. It will take a little\ntime, that's all.\"\n\nBut as Barbara's gaze lingered on the heavy brutal lines of Wolf's\nmassive figure and she caught again the gleam of his gray eyes a\nsickening sense of foreboding gripped her heart.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII\n\nTHE FIGHTING INSTINCT\n\n\nAs questions of discipline became more and more pressing old Tom\nrefused to sit as an active judge in the executive council.\n\nNorman protested in vain against his decision to retire for a while.\n\n\"I can't do no good settin' thar listenin' to them fools,\" the miner\ndeclared. \"They make me sick. Besides, ye all vote me down when I\ntells ye what to do, and things keep on goin' from bad to worse. Jest\nlet me git out and move around among the boys a little. I think I can\ndo some good. You folks is all too chicken-hearted to run this\nBrotherhood. Love and fellowship is all right, but ye've got ter mix a\nlittle law and common sense before ye can straighten the kinks out of\nthis here community.\"\n\nNorman gave his consent reluctantly, and was amazed at the end of a\nweek to observe a remarkable improvement in the spirit of the colony.\nLoafers disappeared, stealing all but ceased, drinking and fighting\nwere on the decrease.\n\nOne by one old Tom had taken the loafers with him on a long walk up\nthe beach. He was usually gone about an hour and always came back\nlaughing and chatting with his friend in the best of humour.\nInvariably the loafer went to work.\n\nIn the same way he took a walk with each one of a crowd of wild,\nunmannerly boys, whose rudeness at the table and whose horse-play\nabout the building had become unendurable. The effects of these walks\nseemed magical. Always the pair returned in a fine humour and the most\nmarked revolution was immediately noted in the conduct of the\noffender.\n\nNorman asked the old man again and again for the secret of his power.\n\nHe replied in the most casual way:\n\n\"Just had a plain heart-to-heart talk with 'em and told 'em what had\nto be--that's all.\"\n\nThe good work had continued for a week with uninterrupted success,\nwhen a bomb was suddenly exploded in the executive council by the\nappearance of an irate mother leading an insolent fourteen-year-old\ncub, who walked rather stiffly.\n\nAmid a silence that was painful, the mother stripped the boy to the\nwaist, thrust him before Norman and Barbara, and said:\n\n\"Now, tell them what you've just told me.\"\n\nThe boy glanced cautiously around to see if his enemy were near and\npoured forth a tale the like of which had never been heard before.\n\n\"Old Tom asked me to take a walk with him. He got me away off in a\nlonely place behind the big rocks on that little island up the beach\nand pulled up a plank drawbridge so I couldn't get back till he wanted\nto let me. He stripped me like this, tied me to a whipping-post and\nnearly beat the life out of me. He said he'd been appointed by the\ncouncil to settle with me in private so nobody would know anything\nabout it.\"\n\n\"Said that he had been appointed by the council to whip you?\" Norman\nasked, in amazement.\n\n\"That's what he said, sir,\" the boy went on. \"He gave me forty-nine\nlashes with a cowhide and then set down and talked to me a half hour.\"\n\n\"And what did he say?\" Norman inquired, forcing back a smile by a\ndesperate effort.\n\n\"He told me that he tried to get out of the work, but the council had\nforced it on him. Said there oughtn't to be no hard feelings, that it\nwas a dirty, tiresome job, and he didn't have no pleasure in it, but\nit had to be done for the salvation of the people. He said it wasn't\nwise to talk about such things among the Brotherhood. I told him I'd\ntell my ma the minute I got home. He said that would be foolish, that\nnone of the others had said a word, that they had all taken their\nmedicine like little men.\"\n\n\"He told you he had whipped all the others who had taken that walk\nwith him?\" Norman gasped.\n\n\"That's what he said, sir,\" the boy insisted, \"and I guess he had, for\nthey'd pawed a hole in the sand 'round that whipping-post big enough\nto bury a horse in.\"\n\nThe boy paused and his mother shook him angrily.\n\n\"Tell what else he said to you!\"\n\nThe cub glanced hastily toward the door and whispered:\n\n\"Said if I opened my mouth about what had happened he'd skin me\nalive.\"\n\nThe council sent the mother and son away with the assurance of\nimmediate action.\n\nThe court adjourned and Norman started with Barbara at once to find\nTom. Faithful to his new calling he had strolled up the beach with a\nman who once had been his partner as a prospector and miner. Joe\nWeatherby had been drinking heavily the week before and Tom had keenly\nfelt the disgrace his old partner had brought on the Brotherhood by\nhis rudeness in the dining-room.\n\nJoe had thrown a plate of soup in the face of a boy who was making\nfacetious remarks about his capacity for strong drink. When rebuked by\nhis neighbours he had accentuated his displeasure by overturning the\ntable and smashing every dish on it. He ended the affair by roundly\ncursing the Brotherhood for its rules and regulations interfering with\nhis personal liberty, threw his pack on his back, and struck the trail\nfor the mountains to prospect for gold.\n\nHe had just returned, after a week's absence, and Tom seized the\nopportunity to invite Joe to take a walk with him.\n\nKnowing the character of the two men, Norman felt quite sure this walk\ncould not possibly have the usual happy ending that attended so many\nof these performances.\n\nHe quickened his pace.\n\n\"Hurry, or we may have a funeral for our next function,\" he cried,\nwith a laugh.\n\nA quarter of a mile up the beach the sound of loud angry words\nsuddenly struck their ears from behind a pile of huge boulders.\n\n\"Quick, we're just in time!\" Barbara cried, \"they've begun to\nquarrel.\"\n\nThey cautiously approached the boulders and climbed to the top of the\nlarger one overlooking the scene Tom had evidently chosen for his\ndebate with Joe.\n\n\"Hadn't you better part them now?\" Barbara asked with some anxiety.\n\n\"No, I'll stop them in time. I want to get acquainted with Tom's\nmethods of persuasion first.\"\n\nTom's voice was rising in accents of wrath. \"Joe, I'm a man o'\npeace--I'm a member o' the Brotherhood and you're my brother, but I'll\ntell ye right now we've got to have law and order in this\ncommunity----\"\n\n\"And I say, Tom Mooney, there hain't no law exceptin' what's inside a\nman.\"\n\n\"Yes, but how kin ye git any law inside a man ef he's always chuck\nfull er licker?\"\n\n\"I don't drink to 'mount to nothin',\" Joe protested. \"Just a drop now\nan' then ter keep me in good health.\"\n\n\"Wall, ef you try any more capers in that dinin'-room, your health's\ngoin' ter break clean down--yer hear me?\"\n\nJoe eyed Tom a moment and said with sharp emphasis:\n\n\"I reckon I can take care o' myself, partner, without you settin' up\nnights to worry about me.\"\n\n\"That's just the trouble, Joe, ye can't. You jined the Brotherhood,\nbut yer faith's gettin' weak. I'm afeard you're onregenerate,\nconceived in sin an' brought forth in iniquity, an' ye ain't had no\nchange er heart nohow.\"\n\n\"Look here, what are ye drivin' at?\" Joe asked, beginning to back away\ncautiously.\n\n\"I just want ter strengthen yer faith, partner,\" Tom protested kindly\nas he advanced good-naturedly and laid his hand on Joe's arm.\n\nJoe shook it off and turned to go. With a sudden spring Tom was on\nhim. A brief, fierce struggle ensued marked by low, savage growls like\ntwo bull-dogs clinched and searching for each other's throats.\n\n\"Stop them! Stop them! They'll kill one another,\" pleaded Barbara.\n\n\"No. It'll do them good. Wait,\" he replied, watching them\nbreathlessly.\n\n\"Here! Here, you old fool,\" growled Joe. \"Do you call this the\nBrotherhood of Man?\"\n\n\"Yes, my son, and specially the Fatherhood er God. The Lord chastens\nthem he loveth!\"\n\nWith a sudden twist the writhing figures fell in the sand, Tom on top\npinning Joe down.\n\nJoe fought with fierce strength to rise but it was no use.\n\nTom clutched his throat and choked him steadily into submission.\n\n\"I'm er man o' peace, Joe,\" he repeated.\n\n\"Yes, you are!\" the bottom one growled.\n\n\"But when I mingles with the unregenerate, my son, I trusts in God an'\nkeeps my powder dry!\"\n\n\"Let me up, you old fool!\" Joe growled.\n\n\"Not yet, my son!\" was the firm answer.\n\n\"You'll get my dander up in a minute and some body's goin' ter git\nhurt,\" warned the prostrate figure.\n\n\"Please make them quit,\" Barbara whispered tremblingly.\n\n\"Nonsense. They're enjoying themselves,\" Norman softly laughed.\n\n\"What are you tryin' ter do anyhow?\" whined Joe.\n\n\"I'm callin' a lost sinner to repentance,\" was the prompt answer.\n\n\"Lemme up, I tell ye,\" Joe yelled, struggling with desperation.\n\nTom choked him again into silence and seated himself comfortably\nacross Joe's stomach.\n\n\"Now, Joseph, my boy. I want you ter say over the catechism of the\nBrotherhood of Man. Hit'll freshen yer mind an' be good fer yer\nsoul----\"\n\nAnother grim struggle interrupted the teacher.\n\n\"Say it after me: I believe in the fatherhood er God----\"\n\nJoe squirmed.\n\n\"Say it!\"\n\nStill no sound. Tom firmly gripped his throat and Joe gurgled:\n\n\"Fatherhood er God!\"\n\n\"And brotherhood o' man!\"\n\n\"Brotherhood er man!\"\n\n\"Yer believe it now?\" Tom fiercely asked.\n\nJoe feebly assented.\n\nTom gripped his throat.\n\n\"Say it strong!\"\n\n\"Yes--I believe it!\" Joe confessed.\n\nAgain the under man struggled desperately and the man on top fiercely\nchoked him into a quieter frame of mind.\n\n\"Now again: No drunkard shall inherit the kingdom er God!\"\n\nJoe repeated, \"No drunkard--shall--what?\"\n\n\"Inherit--the--kingdom--er God--by golly you've forgot yer Bible too!\"\n\n\"Inherit--the--kingdom er--God!\"\n\n\"Who shall not inherit the kingdom of God?\"\n\n\"No drunkard!\" Joe answered.\n\n\"Let that soak into yer lost soul!\" Tom growled, pausing a moment.\n\n\"Now once more! Bear--ye--one--another's burdens!\"\n\nJoe hesitated and the man on top bumped the words out of him one at a\ntime:\n\n\"Bear--ye--one--another's--burdens!\"\n\n\"An' ye're goin' ter help me bear mine?\" the teacher asked.\n\n\"Ain't I a-doin' it now?\" grumbled the man below.\n\n\"Well, once more then: Private property is theft!\"\n\n\"That's a lie an' you know it,\" Joe sneered.\n\n\"The big chief says so and it goes--say it!\"\n\n\"Private property is theft,\" Joe repeated.\n\n\"Well, then, once more: Love--one--another!\"\n\n\"Love one another,\" came the feeble echo.\n\n\"Do ye love me?\" Tom fiercely inquired.\n\nJoe struggled.\n\n\"Say it!\" commanded the teacher.\n\n\"I love ye,\" he groaned.\n\nNorman suddenly appeared on the scene followed by Barbara and the two\nminers leaped to their feet.\n\n\"Tom, old boy,\" the young leader cried, \"you mean well, but we are\ntold by the preacher that the kingdom of God cometh not of\nobservation--it must be from within.\"\n\n\"Just goin' over his Sunday-school lesson with him, Chief.\"\n\nJoe made a hostile movement, and Norman stepped between them.\n\n\"Come! You two big kids--enough of this now, shake hands and make\nup!\"\n\nThe men both hung back stubbornly.\n\nNorman turned to Tom.\n\n\"Were you not partners and friends before you joined the Brotherhood?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" the old miner replied grudgingly. \"We bin tergether twelve\nyears an' we worked an' played tergether, starved an' froze tergether,\nlived tergether, an' slept under the same blanket--he's the only\npartner I ever had--an' he's my best friend\"--Tom paused and\nchoked--\"but I don't like 'im!\"\n\n\"Shake hands and make up!\" Barbara laughed.\n\nThey hung back a moment longer until Barbara's smile became\nresistless.\n\nJoe extended his hand, exclaiming:\n\n\"Shake, you old coyote!\"\n\nNorman gave Joe a serious talk--got a pledge from him to quit drink\nand stand by him in his efforts to bring order out of the confusion\nand chaos in which the colony was floundering.\n\n\"You think I can do anything to help you?\" Joe asked incredulously.\n\n\"Of course you can. You and Tom are two men I've known all my life. I\nknow where to find you if I get into trouble.\"\n\n\"Is there goin' ter be any trouble?\" Tom broke in, eagerly.\n\n\"Not yet, but it's coming. When it does we'll fight it out and win.\nI've set my life on the issue of this experiment.\"\n\nJoe extended him his hand. \"I'm sorry I got drunk. I won't do it\nagain--we'll stand by ye!\"\n\n\"Through thick an' thin,\" Tom added.\n\n\"And hereafter, Tom,\" Norman said with a smile, \"I'd like to be\nconsulted before you hold any more sessions of your court up the\nbeach.\"\n\nTom started.\n\n\"You've heard about it?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"By gum, I knowed I oughter licked that kid again!\" the old miner\nobserved, regretfully.\n\nNorman, said gravely: \"Tom, we are getting into deep water. I've begun\nto have some doubts about our safety. A leader must lead. And I'm\ngoing to do it. Can I depend on you to execute my orders and mine\nalone?\"\n\n\"Every day in the year,\" was the firm reply.\n\n\"The same here,\" Joe echoed.\n\nBarbara had drawn apart from the group of men and stood watching them\nwith keen, suspicious interest as the two miners started homeward with\nrestored good humour.\n\n\"What did you mean by saying that you were afraid of coming trouble?\"\nBarbara eagerly asked of Norman. \"What have you heard? What do you\nsuspect?\"\n\n\"Nothing,\" he answered, thoughtfully. \"But I've had the blues for a\nweek. It's been growing on me that we are not getting on except into\nsituations more and more impossible. There's a screw loose somewhere\nin our system. There's going to be a wreck unless we find and repair\nit.\"\n\n\"I have felt this, too, and I think I know the cause.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Liberty which has degenerated into licence. We lack authority and the\npower to enforce it.\"\n\n\"And this is the one thing we cursed in the old system--the law,\npower, authority.\"\n\n\"No,\" Barbara quickly objected. \"We did not rebel against law or the\nexercise of authority. We rebelled against its unjust use.\"\n\n\"And what depresses me is that I am convinced that we must use the\npower of law with more stern, direct, and personal pressure than ever\nknown under the system of capitalism, or we must fail.\"\n\n\"Is not such pressure desirable?\"\n\n\"It depends on who applies the pressure--but it seems inevitable--and\nit depresses me.\"\n\nBarbara broke into a joyous laugh.\n\n\"Away with gloomy forebodings! It's only a day's fog. It will lift.\nThe sun is shining behind it now.\"\n\nHer laughter was contagious. Norman smiled in quick sympathy, and a\nresponse of hope and courage was just forming itself on his lips when\nhe looked toward the house and saw an excited crowd packed in the\ndoorway.\n\n\"What on earth is the matter?\" Barbara gasped.\n\n\"Some accident has happened,\" he replied, quickly. \"Come, we must\nhurry!\"\n\nCatherine's lithe figure darted down the steps and met them on the\nlawn.\n\n\"What is it?\" Norman cried.\n\n\"A murder!\"\n\n\"A murder?\" Barbara repeated, incredulously.\n\n\"Yes--wilful, deliberate, cruel, horrible!\" Catherine went on\nexcitedly.\n\n\"Not old Tom and Joe?\" Norman broke in.\n\n\"No--Blanche----\"\n\n\"Oh, God, I knew it,\" Barbara gasped. \"Go on.\"\n\n\"Blanche kept on playing fast and loose with the two boys who fought\nover her the other night. George Mann found his rival in her room just\nnow, waylaid him in the hall, and when he came out sprang on him like\na fiend, stabbed him through the heart and cut his throat. The\nbrothers of the dead boy swear they will kill the murderer on sight,\nand they've locked him in your room, Norman, for safety. The men are\nexcited to frenzy. Nobody likes the boy who did the crime. The\nrougher ones swear they are going to hang him. They tried to break in\nyour door twice, but Herman knocked the ringleaders down and with Tom\nand Joe beat the crowd back. Something must be done at once to prevent\nanother outbreak.\"\n\nNorman hurried to the scene and joined Wolf in his defence of the\nprisoner. Tom formed a guard of ten men heavily armed and marched the\nprisoner to the top of the house, placed him in the small room in one\nof the central towers, and stationed one man inside and five on the\nstairway leading into the tower.\n\nThe executive council met immediately and voted unanimously to erect a\nprison, establish a penal colony on the small island at the north of\nVentura, and restore the whipping-post for minor offenders.\n\nThe announcement of this momentous act was made to the general\nassembly without request for debate or an expression of opinion. It\nwas received in silence.\n\nThe Bard could not protest. He was still confined to his room from the\neffects of a recent argument with his wife.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII\n\nTHE CORDS TIGHTEN\n\n\nOn Wolf's urgent advice Norman determined to use the autocratic power\ninvested in him by the deed of gift to establish a complete code of\nlaw and enforce it without fear or favour. As the cords tightened,\nscores who became dissatisfied with their lot offered their\nresignations and asked to return to their old homes.\n\nIn answer to their clamour Norman posted this notice on the bulletin\nboard:\n\n    \"Every member of the army of the Brotherhood of Man enlisted for\n    five years' service. Resignations will not be considered and\n    deserters will be tried by court-martial. I am going to use my\n    power for the best interests of the Brotherhood. I ask the\n    co\u00c3\u00b6peration of all the loyal members of the colony. Of traitors\n    I ask no quarter, and I expect to give none.\n\n                                              \"NORMAN WORTH,\n                                 \"_Trustee and General Manager_.\"\n\nThe effects of the proclamation were instantaneous. The helplessness\nof any attempt to resist authority firmly established under such\ndaring leadership was at once apparent to the most stupid mind.\n\nLoafing, drinking, stealing, carousing, and disorder of all kind were\nreduced at once to a minimum.\n\nOne act, however, of the executive council under Norman's direction\nprecipitated a storm in an unexpected quarter.\n\nThe council removed Blanche and a group of wayward girls with whom she\nassociated to a cottage outside the lawn.\n\nThe women of the Brotherhood were practically unanimous in their\ndemands that the whole group be immediately expelled from the colony.\nA committee of three aggressive women presented their demand to Norman\nin no uncertain language.\n\nHis reply was equally emphatic:\n\n\"Comrades,\" he said, firmly, \"I shall do nothing of the kind. We are\ngoing to work out this experiment in human society without compromise.\nWe have successfully cut communication with the outside world. The\ncrew of our ship are no longer allowed to land and only picked men\nunload her cargo. We are not going to play the baby act and dump these\ngirls back on the old civilization which we have denounced. They may\nbe wayward but they are our sisters.\"\n\n\"They are not mine,\" shouted one of the committee. \"The brazen\ncreatures! And we do not propose to have our sons and daughters\ncorrupted by association with them.\"\n\n\"Then we must find some other solution than that of transportation,\"\nNorman insisted.\n\n\"Send them to the penal colony, then,\" demanded the committee.\n\n\"And back in a circle we immediately travel to the crimes of\ncivilization from which we fled. I prefer to send the boys who\nassociate with them. They are the real offenders.\"\n\n\"I deny that assertion,\" firmly declared the leader of the committee.\n\"My boy is one of the unfortunate victims of these brazen wretches.\nBefore we came to this island he never gave me a word of impudence.\nFrom the night he met Blanche at our first ball he was beyond my\nadvice or control. These girls are the enemies of society and this\ncolony cannot exist if they remain within its life.\"\n\n\"I refuse to believe it,\" Norman cried, with scorn. \"It is your duty\nto reform these girls and restore them to mental and physical sanity,\nand as the leader of this colony I direct you to take up this divine\nwork.\"\n\n\"And I, for one,\" spoke, for the first time, the silent gray-haired\nmember of the committee, \"refuse to smirch my hands with the task.\"\n\nNorman, looked into the calm face of this white-haired, motherly\nlooking woman with amazement.\n\n\"I can't understand you, comrade mother!\" he exclaimed, with\nbitterness.\n\n\"That's because you're young, handsome, inexperienced, and, above all,\nbecause you are a man,\" was the quick reply. \"I have spent a busy life\nsince my own children grew out of the home nest in New York City in\ntrying to help other people's children less fortunate than my own.\nI've helped scores of boys and never had one to disappoint me yet.\nI've tried to help scores of girls of the type we are discussing. I've\nalways regretted it. I found them shallow, false, lazy, stupid,\nworthless. I have never looked at one of them except to blush that I\nam a woman. I speak from the saddest and most hopeless experiences of\nmy life.\"\n\nNorman cut the argument short with a gesture of angry impatience.\n\"This discussion is a waste of breath. As long as I am in command of\nthis colony no such insane act of injustice shall be committed against\nthese girls.\"\n\n\"Then it's time you gave place to a man of greater wisdom and less\nsentimental mush in his brain,\" replied the calm, gray-haired woman.\n\n\"Thank you,\" the young leader replied, with chilling politeness, \"you\nmay be right--but in the meantime I accept the responsibility. Good\nday.\"\n\nHe had made three enemies whose power he was soon to feel. As they\npassed through the doorway Catherine greeted them politely and soothed\ntheir ruffled spirits with gentle words.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV\n\nSOME INTERROGATION POINTS\n\n\nThe establishment of a police and detective service completed the\nefficient organization of the colony. Its life now began to move with\nclock-like regularity.\n\nBut these changes were not made without provoking fierce debates and\nbitter prophecies in the general assembly over which Norman presided\nevery Friday night.\n\nHe began to listen to these endless wrangles, however, with a sense of\ngrowing anger. It became clearer each week that they were the source\nof cliques and factions, of plots and counter-plots, within the\ncolony. His patience reached the limit on the night he announced the\ncompletion of the jail.\n\n\"This is a sad present I am forced to make you to-night, comrades,\" he\nsaid, with a note of weariness in his voice. \"But I have no choice in\nthe matter. It was forced on the executive council. Crimes were\ncommitted which threatened the existence of our society. We had to\nmeet the issue squarely. We could have begged the question by calling\nin the authorities of the State of California, acknowledged our\ndefeat, and surrendered. We are not ready to surrender. We haven't\nbegun to fight yet.\"\n\nHe had scarcely taken his seat when Diggs, the human\ninterrogation-point, slowly unwound his lank figure, adjusted his\neye-glasses, and gazed smilingly at the chairman.\n\nNorman squirmed with rage as the glint of light from Diggs's big\nlenses began to irritate his spirit.\n\nBarbara slipped her little hand under the table and found his. He\nclasped it gratefully and refused to let go. She allowed him to hold\nit a minute and drew it away laughing.\n\n\"Comrades,\" the man of questions slowly began, \"we are making rapid\nprogress. Our new building will soon be finished and another colony of\ntwo thousand enthusiastic souls will be added to our commonwealth. If\nwe are going to successfully carry on this work we must begin to\ndevelop with infinite patience the details of this larger life.\n\n\"I submit to you some questions that are profoundly interesting to me.\n\n\"How are we to prevent speculation, wages being unequal? How is one\ncommunity to exchange products with another? How determine which line\nof goods each community shall make?\n\n\"What is to be done with a strong minority who are bitterly opposed to\nthe action of the majority when we assume our permanent democratic\nform?\n\n\"How are the thousand and one matters pertaining to private life and\nhabits to be settled without continually augmenting the power of\ngovernment? The authority of the most absolute despot who ever lived\nnever dared to sit on questions we must decide. Can we do it?\n\n\"If we are ever to attain a condition of equality must we not forbid\ngifts and exchanges? For, if men are not to be allowed to grow rich by\ntrading, must not the State forbid private exchanges of every nature?\n\n\"On the other hand, if the State alone can make exchanges, how can we\nprevent a shrewd man from getting rich by dealing with the State\nitself?\n\n\"If the State will not make exchanges, what is one to do who has taken\na piece of property and finds later he has no use for it? For example:\nif Miss Blanche grows tired of looking at her piano, which she cannot\nplay, and desires to exchange it for a carriage and pair of horses,\nmust she continue to walk because she cannot effect the exchange?\n\n    [Illustration: BARBARA.]\n\n\"If we solve these troubles by declaring all property in common, who\nshall decide the privilege of use which the various tastes of\nindividuals may demand?\n\n\"If each member be allowed a fixed number of units of value for each\nday of the year, must he spend them at once, or will the State keep an\naccount for each individual? If he doesn't spend all his allowance by\nthe end of the year can he save it and thus accumulate a private\nfortune?\n\n\"Or will the State force him to spend all, thus encouraging reckless\nhabits?\n\n\"Suppose that a spendthrift squanders his allowance at once and later\nbreaks his leg, has it amputated, and needs a hundred dollars to buy a\nwooden leg, how will he get it? Will the State make good his\nrecklessness, force him to buy his own leg, or make him hop through\nthe year on one leg?\"\n\n\"I move we adjourn!\" Joe yelled, from the rear.\n\n\"Second the motion!\" Tom echoed, from the front.\n\nThe Bard, who had recovered sufficiently to attend on crutches, rose\npainfully, adjusted the bandage on his eye, and once more raised his\nvoice in protest.\n\n\"I demand freedom of speech on behalf of my friend whom those rowdies\nare insulting!\" he thundered.\n\nWith reluctance the chairman rapped for order, and Diggs wiped his\nglasses and smilingly proceeded:\n\n\"We have established a general nursery for the children. As they grow\nup, who shall decide at what age each child shall begin to work? Some\nchildren are slow, some quick in growth. Will the new State of Ventura\ntake direct charge of all children?\n\n\"Or, supposing that separate families are allowed to live apart and\nparents to govern their own children, how is each child to be\nprotected so that it gets its exact due? How is it to be known whether\nthe parents misappropriate the fund of a child, or favour one more\nthan another?\n\n\"As our numbers increase we cannot avoid the religious question.\"\n\n\"Amen, O Lord!\" shouted Methodist John.\n\n\"A number of good people are clamouring for the use of this hall for\nreligious services every night. We may deny their demands now. But we\ncannot as they increase. How are we to meet them? Shall we tax the\nunbeliever to support a church? Or shall we tax the believer to pay\nfor lighting this hall for a weekly ball?\n\n\"If religion is allowed, who shall determine how many preachers each\ndenomination can have? How many sisters shall be allowed the Catholics\nand how many monks, and how shall they be distributed? To whom shall\nthey answer, the State, or their superior church dignitary?\n\n\"Shall Protestants be allowed a sum equal to the amount used in\nsupport of religious orders? If so, who shall determine how it shall\nbe expended?\n\n\"If churches are built, who shall determine their cost and their style\nof architecture if the State erects them?\n\n\"When our theatre is opened, shall admission be free? If not, what\nshall be done when the receipts fall below expenses?\n\n\"What compensation can we give to those who hate theatres? If a small\nmajority want a dance-hall and musical extravaganza, and a minority\nwant only the serious drama, which shall it be? Suppose a majority\ndemand a race-course? Shall the resources of the colony be used thus\nagainst the bitter protest of those who do not believe in racing?\nSuppose, just before the race-course is finished, the majority become\na minority and the work is stopped--has the new majority the right to\ndestroy the property and accumulate a new fund for a different\npurpose?\n\n\"Must a doctor always come when he's called--even for imaginary,\nhysterical, and foolish causes? Will the people vote for and elect\ntheir own doctor, or will he be assigned? If the doctor proves a\nfailure, how will they get rid of him? If they get rid of him, how\ncan he be saddled on another community? Shall one community suffer at\nthe hands of an incompetent man, while a physician of genius ministers\nto the one next door? If a great surgeon is needed by ten persons at\nthe same hour, who shall decide which operation he shall perform, and\nwho shall live or die in consequence?\n\n\"Who shall say when a doctor is not fit to practise?\n\n\"We have just established a weekly paper. Within a year the population\nwill need a daily. Who shall say when an editor is competent?\n\n\"Some men fail in early life and make their great success later. At\nwhat period, or after how long a trial, shall it be decided that a man\nis a failure and must quit his chosen or assigned work?\n\n\"Many young men promise well at first and make later miserable\nfailures. Many are failures at first and make great successes. Who\nshall decide which to continue and which to stop? If a youth is forced\nto abandon a work on which he has set his heart, how can he be made of\nservice to the community in a work he loathes?\n\n\"We must continue to make inventions, or progress ceases. When the\ncost of experiments is greater than the total income of a citizen, how\ncan the inventor bear the expense? Will any man sacrifice his own\nfunds and his own time on an uncertain experiment when he can receive\nno benefit from the work?\n\n\"Many men are working now over problems all other men believe cannot\nbe solved. If the State must furnish the capital to make the\nexperiments of inventors, who will be responsible for the enormous\nwaste of treasure on senseless and useless and impossible inventions?\n\n\"Who can decide whether ideas proposed are useless or impossible? All\ngreat inventions which have revolutionized the history of ages have\nbeen laughed at by the world.\n\n\"How can we punish the jobbery and waste and corruption which may\nenter from experiments which are not made in good faith? Cannot any\ngroup of shrewd men pretend to have invented a machine which will save\nover half the labour of the colony, and spend millions on this\nimaginary invention which proves useless? If such an abuse of power\nshould be made, would not the effect be to end forever all experiments\nand stop the progress of the world?\n\n\"When many cities have been built and one is more healthful,\nbeautiful, and cultured than the others, shall those who live in the\npoorer cities be allowed to move or be forced to remain where they\nare? How are sculptors, artists, musicians, or architects to be\napportioned among different communities? Suppose they all demand the\nright to live in one place?\n\n\"Will the State publish all books by all authors, or will selections\nbe made? If all books are published will not vast sums be wasted in\nprinting worthless trash? If selections are made, what unprejudiced,\ninfallible board can be found competent to decide?\n\n\"If a man chooses to be a writer, how many years shall he be allowed\nto work at his occupation if in the opinion of the judges he shows no\ntalent?\n\n\"Will the State permit freedom of opinion in the columns of its papers\nand the books printed? If so, what shall hinder a treasonable\nconspiracy from destroying respect for its authority? If opinions are\nto be edited by the State, how can the freedom of the press be\nmaintained?\n\n\"What shall be done with the Negro, the Chinaman, and the Indian when\ntheir numbers largely increase? Will these inferior races be placed on\nan absolute equality with the Aryan and will they be allowed to freely\nintermarry? If so, can the new mongrel race maintain itself against\nthe progress and power of the great high-bred races of men?\n\n\"Are women to receive the same allowance as men, and married women the\nsame as spinsters?\n\n\"Shall men and women be required to marry or be allowed to remain\nsingle? Shall all women be made to work? If it continues to cost more\nto support a single woman than a married one, how can equality of\nrights be maintained?\n\n\"As food is the basis of all supply, many must be farmers. How shall\nthis great industry be conducted ultimately? Can we allow individuals\nto work small farms? If so, who determines the kind of crop each farm\nshall raise? How much land will a man be required to work?\n\n\"An Italian from the north of Italy can raise more on one acre than an\nIrishman can on ten--whose method shall be used, and whose capacity be\ntaken for the standard?\n\n\"How many hours shall constitute a day on the farm? Shall a farmhand\nget only a dollar a day and a bricklayer two? If so, where is the\njustice and equality of such an arrangement?\n\n\"Can a farmer be allowed vacations? If so, must he ask permission\nwhere to go? If not, suppose he goes at seedtime or harvest, gets\ndrunk, stays two weeks or two months, and destroys a year's crop? Who\nshall pay for this enormous damage, and how shall the penalty be\nenforced?\n\n\"Suppose a poor manager spoils the crop on an immense tract of land,\nhow can any adequate penalty be enforced?\n\n\"Shall one general manager decide what kind of crops to raise on each\npiece of land or each manager decide for himself? Suppose they all\nraise hay----\"\n\n\"Then you'll have plenty to eat the balance of your life--you and all\nthe other jackasses in the colony!\" old Tom growled.\n\nA laugh rippled the crowd and the speaker paused in angry confusion.\nFor the first time he lost his temper and stood glaring at his\ntormentors in silent rage.\n\nNorman whispered to Barbara:\n\n\"Wolf has urged me for some time to suppress this meeting. Shall I do\nit?\"\n\n\"Yes. It's a nuisance. I agree with him. Do it.\"\n\nNorman rose just as Diggs sat down choking with anger.\n\n\"Comrades,\" the young leader said, in commanding tones. \"I think this\nassembly has completed its work of discussion. The questions\npropounded here to-night are important. We will meet and solve them in\ndue time, as we come to them. What this community needs now is the\nspirit of co\u00c3\u00b6peration, of loyalty, and industry. We have been assigned\nour tasks for the year. Now every man to his work! We have had enough\nof wrangling and questioning. Let's live and breathe awhile. The\nexecutive council has decided to close the weekly sessions of the\nassembly until the annual election of officers next spring. Hereafter\na musicale and dance will be held both Monday and Friday evenings.\"\n\nThe young folks broke into hearty applause led by old Tom and his\npartner Joe.\n\nThe Bard sprang to his feet, his one good eye blazing with inspired\nwrath.\n\n\"And I denounce this act of tyranny as the climax of a series of\ninfamies! You have now forged the chains of slavery on every limb.\nFree speech has been suppressed--in God's name, what next?\"\n\nBut the crowd only laughed. The Bard had protested so often his words\nceased to have weight. The halo of romance that once wreathed his\nclassic brow had faded with the painful disillusioning which followed\na thrashing his wife had given him. He was a prophet without honour\nand his warnings fell on deaf ears.\n\nWolf and Catherine stood at the door with a word of cheer, a friendly\nnod, or a silent pressure of the hand for every one who emerged from\nthe hall. These two alone at every turn grew in prestige among all\njarring factions of the struggling colony.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV\n\nTHE MASTER HAND\n\n\nThe whole machinery of the colony responded instantly to the grip of\nthe master's hand. It was the one thing needed to insure successful\nprogress.\n\nWhen the Brotherhood realized that the young poet-athlete was not\nmerely a love-sick dreamer and theorist, but a man of quick decisions,\nof firm and inflexible will, and the power to execute his will, they\nfell in line, caught the step, and order emerged from chaos.\n\nWhen a crisis called for decision he made it with lightning rapidity\nand stuck to it. The situation demanded a dictatorship for the moment,\nand he did not hesitate to assume it. He saw before him sure success.\nIf fools and cranks interfered with his plans he would crush and push\nthem aside. The consciousness of power and its daily exercise\ndeveloped his faculties to their highest tension. His mind began to\narrange every detail of the vast and complicated system of the new\nsocial scheme. Men became the mere tools with which he would work out\nthe revolution in human society. Every scrap of knowledge he had ever\ngained flashed through his excited imagination and fell into its place\nin the creation of the new order.\n\nHe put the machine-shops to work constructing the big gold dredge on\nwhich he had experimented one summer.\n\nHe had a pet scheme of farming which had come into his mind from\nwatching his father's gardener the year before raise the most\ndelicious cantaloups he had ever tasted. He discovered the secret of\ntheir marvellous sweetness and leaped to an instantaneous conclusion.\nHe had the opportunity to test this inspiration now on a scale as vast\nas his dreams.\n\nHe called the superintendents and overseers of the farm together, and\nasked their plans for the crop on the five hundred acres of fertile\nlands under cultivation. They gave him their schedule for a variety of\ncrops.\n\n\"Won't this soil grow cantaloups?\" he asked.\n\nThey all reported that it would.\n\n\"Then I suggest that the entire acreage be planted in these vines.\"\n\nTo a man they declared the plan absurd.\n\n\"But suppose,\" he persisted, \"that we raise and send to the East the\nmost delicious melon they have ever tasted, and suppose we get three\ndollars a crate, we will make three hundred dollars an acre and our\nfirst crop will be worth one hundred and fifty thousand dollars.\"\n\nThey laughed at him.\n\n\"Do you know,\" smilingly inquired the superintendent, \"how much it\nwill cost to plant and harvest such a crop?\"\n\n\"I should say twenty-five dollars an acre,\" he replied.\n\n\"Double it,\" he cried.\n\n\"Very well, fifty dollars an acre,\" Norman agreed. \"In round numbers\nit will cost us twenty-five thousand dollars. That leaves a profit of\nmore than a hundred thousand, doesn't it?\"\n\nAgain the superintendent laughed.\n\n\"And would you risk this enormous sum on one experiment? Suppose your\nmelons would not be sweet?\"\n\n\"There is no such possibility,\" the young enthusiast declared. \"Their\nsweetness depends solely on two things--the quality of the seed and\nthe quantity of rain which falls on them while they are growing. We\nare wasting a supreme opportunity. No rain falls in Ventura during the\nsummer. We get our water to the roots by irrigation, not by rainfall.\nGet the right seed and your melons must be perfect. This is a\nscientific fact I have seen demonstrated. Try it on a vast scale and\nsuccess is sure.\"\n\nThey voted unanimously against the proposition. Norman insisted. The\nsuperintendent resigned and appealed to the executive council. Wolf\nand Catherine, Tom and Barbara advised against placing so much capital\nin a single enterprise.\n\n\"I've got to make you rich and successful in spite of yourselves,\"\nNorman finally declared. \"For the present I control these funds and\nI'm going to plant this crop. So that settles it. I'm sorry we can't\nagree.\"\n\nHis instantaneous decision fairly took Wolf's breath.\n\nBarbara laughed and congratulated him.\n\n\"At least you have the courage of your convictions. I can't help\nadmiring it.\"\n\nAs further opposition was useless, the order was put into execution.\nThe superintendent finally caught the young man's spirit, withdrew his\nresignation, and undertook the work with enthusiasm.\n\nAt the end of the summer the success of the colony was astounding. The\nwildest prediction of the young leader fell below the facts. The crop\nof cantaloups averaged one hundred and five crates to the acre, and\nbrought three dollars and a half a crate. The net profit on the\nmelons reached the enormous total of one hundred and fifty thousand\ndollars.\n\nThe men who raised the crop and added this wealth to the treasury of\nthe colony were not slow in demanding an immediate readjustment of the\nscale of wages.\n\nTwo hundred and fifty men had done all the work of planting,\ncultivating, harvesting this crop and added ten times as much to the\nyear's income as the combined labour of all the other members of the\ncolony.\n\nBrick-masons were receiving two dollars a day and farm-hands one\ndollar. The miners who were digging for gold in the mountain ranges\nand on the beaches were receiving five dollars a day and had added as\nyet not a single dollar to the wealth of the community. They had\ndiscovered gold in three new districts and thousands of dollars had\nbeen wasted in vain efforts to make it pay. The farmers protested\nbitterly against such waste, and demanded the equalization of wages.\n\nTheir spokesman astonished Norman by the vehemence and audacity of\ntheir demands:\n\n\"If Socialism means justice,\" he shouted, \"now is the time to prove\nit! Labour creates all value. We have created one hundred and fifty\nthousand dollars' worth of wealth for the colony and we have received\na mere pittance. If we created this wealth----\"\n\n\"Wait a minute, comrades,\" Norman interrupted, with irritation. \"Why\nshould you continue to repeat that foolish assertion? You didn't\ncreate this wealth.\"\n\n\"Then I'd like to know who did?\" shouted the orator. \"We turned the\nsoil, placed the fertilizers, planted every seed, cultivated every\nvine, pulled every melon, packed and placed them on the steamer. If we\ndidn't make the wealth, who did?\"\n\n\"I did,\" the young leader declared. \"I conceived the possibility of\nthis crop. I tried to persuade your superintendent and overseers. They\nhad no faith. I forced them to plant these particular seeds against\ntheir own wishes. Your labour is a fixed thing year in and year out.\nAll men must work or die. All life is a struggle thus with tooth and\nnail for a living. The creator of wealth is the superior intelligence\nthat conceives something better than this clodhopper's daily task. You\ndid what you were told to do. Your hands would have worked just as\nmany hours at labour just as tiresome over a crop of beans that\nwouldn't have paid a profit at all this year. Wealth belongs to its\ncreator. I made the crop, your hands were the mere automata which my\nbrain directed. Your demands are absurd. I refuse to consider them or\nto permit their discussion.\"\n\nThe farmers refused point-blank to submit to this decision, and voted\nunanimously to quit work until they were given justice. Every plough\nstopped and the entire machinery of food production came to a dead\nstandstill.\n\nNorman threatened to refuse them admission to the dining-hall unless\nthey returned to work, and they boldly replied that they would smash\nthe door down and take what was their own.\n\nHad the farmers been alone in their demands for an equalization of\nwages, the situation would have been easier to handle. But discontent\nover the question of wages had been growing steadily since the day of\nthe decision that wages should be unequal.\n\nThe distinctions of wealth and poverty were rapidly making their\nappearance as in the old world. The cook had married a scrubwoman and\nthe scrubwoman's daughter had married the drainman who had charge of\nthe sewers. The combine income of the two highest-salaried workers in\nthe colony had at once formed the nucleus of a new aristocracy of\nwealth.\n\nThe strike of the entire farming division of the colony was the match\nthrown in the powder magazine. Discontent flamed in every department\nof labour.\n\nThe demand for absolute equality of wages became resistless. It was\nthe only thing which could once more bring order out of chaos.\n\nNorman called a meeting of the general assembly and submitted the\nquestion for their discussion and decision. The debate was long,\nfierce, and bitter. In vain did the young leader plead with those who\nwere receiving the highest rates that the profits of the colony would\nbe greater and that each would share alike in the total wealth of the\ncommunity. They denounced the proposed act as the climax of infamy.\n\nThe chef was furious.\n\n\"You give me the wages of a clodhopper and ask me to prepare a table\nfit for a king. Well, try it, and see what you get.\"\n\nHe sat down repeating his threat in a series of endless announcements\nto the people around him.\n\n\"I think he'll poison us all if you pass this law,\" Barbara whispered.\n\n\"The farmers will run us through with their pitchforks if we don't,\"\nhe laughed.\n\n\"Poisoning is the easier way,\" she sighed.\n\nThe leader of the brass band raised the biggest row of all. From the\nfirst these men had refused to lift their hand to do a thing except\nto play at stated hours each day and furnish the music for the three\nevenings of social amusement.\n\n\"You place me on an equality with the lout who holds a calf or the\nclodhopper who holds a plough--I, who feed the soul with ravishing\nmelody--I, who lift man from earth to heaven on the wings of angels!\"\nThe band leader swelled with righteous wrath and sat down beside the\ncook who was still muttering incoherently:\n\n\"Let 'em try it--and see what they get!\"\n\nYet, in spite of the fierce threats of the cook, the scrubwoman, the\ndrainman, the musician, and all the high-salaried favourites of\nlabour, the inevitable occurred. When put to a vote equal wages were\nestablished by an overwhelming majority.\n\nEach member of the colony, man, woman, and child, was voted free food,\nclothes, and shelter, and a credit of five hundred dollars a year at\nthe Brotherhood store.\n\nThe executive council was abolished and in its place a board of\ngovernors established, composed of the heads of each department of\nlabour and presided over by two regents, a man and a woman, elected by\nthe general assembly. Norman and Barbara were elected regents without\nopposition, and the old heads of each department of labour placed on\nthe board of governors to serve until the approaching annual election.\n\nThe assembly proposed:\n\n\"Article I. of the constitution of the new State of Ventura as\nfollows:\n\n\"Every citizen of the State must labour according to his ability.\nThose who can work and will not shall be made to work.\"\n\nNo man who voted this simple and obviously just law could dream of the\ntremendous results. It was merely the enactment into statutory law of\nthe first principle of an effective Socialism:\n\n\"From every man according to his ability, unto every man according to\nhis needs.\"\n\nThe first obvious requirement of such a law was an immediate increase\nof the police and detective force at the command of the regents and\nthe board of governors.\n\nNorman thanked the assembly for the promptness and thoroughness which\nhad characterized their work, and closed his congratulations with a\nsentence of peculiarly sinister meaning to the man who had ears to\nhear.\n\n\"Hereafter, comrades, we can move forward without another pause. There\ncan never be another strike on the island of Ventura. The State is now\nsupreme.\"\n\nThe Wolfs, who had modestly declined all office, were omnipresent\nduring the long sessions of the assembly, which had lasted two days.\nEverywhere they had counselled compromise, forbearance, good\nfellowship, moving quietly from group to group in the big hall, and\nalways winning new friends.\n\nWolf's gnarled hand gripped Norman's at the close of the meeting as he\nbent his massive head and whispered:\n\n\"A great day's work, Comrade Chief--one that will make history.\"\n\nThe young leader's face clouded as he slowly replied:\n\n\"I wish I were sure that it will be history of the right kind.\"\n\n\"You doubt it?\" the old leader asked incredulously.\n\n\"It all depends on our leadership.\"\n\n\"With your hand on the helm\"--Wolf paused and smiled curiously--\"the\nship of State is safe.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI\n\nAT THE PARTING OF THE WAYS\n\n\nAgain the colony entered on a period of active and efficient industry.\nEvery man was at his post and did the work assigned him.\n\nEight hours was fixed as a working day in all departments. The first\nacts of insubordination were promptly suppressed. The discipline of an\narmy was strictly enforced--the guard-house and whipping-post were\nfound sufficient.\n\nNo report except the most favourable had ever reached the outside\nworld, and thousands of applicants in San Francisco were clamouring\nfor admission. The new colony house with accommodation for two\nthousand had been completed, and another of like size was under way.\n\nWolf had urged Norman to admit a new colony at once and prepare for\nthe third. But the difficulties of government and the fights within\nthe Brotherhood had alarmed the young leader. He hesitated, and the\nbig new building as yet remained empty.\n\nAs the day for the annual meeting of the assembly drew near, doubts of\nthe future grew darker in the young regent's mind. He had the power,\nunder the deed of gift, to prolong the experiment another year,\nholding the title to the property for further experiment, or divide\nthe profits between the members and reconvey the gift back to its\ndonors, or by deed convey at once the whole property to the\nBrotherhood and end his trusteeship.\n\nWhich should it be?\n\nHis faith in his fellow man had been shaken by the events of the past\nyear, and yet the colony had succeeded. Its wealth was great and its\nprospects greater. With the perfect discipline recently inaugurated\nand wisely administered, no limit could be fixed to the productive\npower of such an organization.\n\nThat he should hesitate a moment after the achievements of the year\nwas a stunning shock to Wolf. The moment he realized the import of the\ncrisis, he at once appealed to Barbara.\n\n\"You alone can save us, child,\" he urged. \"You must act at once. You\npromised to lead him captive in your train. You have failed for one\nreason only----\"\n\n\"Yes, I know,\" Barbara interrupted. \"I haven't tried. I confess it.\"\n\n\"There is not a moment to lose,\" Wolf urged. \"We are entering on the\nmost wonderful development in the history of the human race. The only\nthing lacking for its triumphant achievement is faith and leadership.\nSecure from our young dreamer the title to this island and you will\nachieve an immortal deed--you will not hesitate or fail?\"\n\n\"No,\" was the firm answer. \"I will not fail. I'm going with him to-day\non a mountain climb. Just for fun, if for nothing else, I'll test my\npower.\"\n\n\"You'll report to me the moment you return?\" Wolf urged.\n\n\"Yes,\" she answered, dreamily.\n\nNorman found Barbara in a mood resistlessly charming. She seemed to\nhave utterly forgotten that she was grown up or had ever been the\nherald of a revolutionary cause. She was a laughing girl of eighteen\nagain, with the joy of youth sparkling in her eyes and laughter\nringing in every accent of her voice.\n\nInstantly the mood of the man reflected hers. He threw to the winds\nthe cares and worries of the great adventure that had brought them\ntogether, and the island of Ventura became the enchanted isle of song\nand story.\n\n\"We shall be just two children to-day--shall we not?\" she asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" he responded gaily, \"two children who have run away from\nschool, tired of books, with hearts hungry for the breath of the\nfields.\"\n\nFor half an hour hill and dale rang with laughter as they ascended the\npath of the brook. They came to a wide expanse of still water. And\nNorman said with a bantering laugh:\n\n\"We leave the stream here and climb the hill to the left. I must wade\nand carry you across this place if you're not afraid?\"\n\n\"Who's afraid?\" she asked with scorn.\n\n\"All right.\"\n\nHe removed his shoes, and rolled his trousers high.\n\n\"Now your arm around my neck, and no jumping or screaming until we're\nsafe on the other shore.\"\n\nShe hesitated just an instant, blushed, and slipped her soft round arm\nabout his neck as he lifted her slight figure and began to pick his\nway across the treacherous surface of the slippery bottom. His foot\nslipped on a muddy stone. She gave a scream, and both arms gripped his\nneck in sudden fear. Her burning cheek pressed his forehead.\n\n\"I beg your pardon,\" she cried, blushing red. \"I didn't mean to\nsmother you.\"\n\n\"And I distinctly said no jumping or screaming, didn't I?\"\n\n\"I won't do it again--oh, dear!\"\n\nAgain both arms clasped his neck in a strangling, smothering hug,\nwhich he purposely prolonged with an extra slip which might have been\navoided.\n\nHer face was scarlet now and the blushes refused to go. They lingered\nin great red bunches after he had carefully placed her on the smooth\ngrass on the opposite bank.\n\n\"Honestly, I'm afraid I disgraced myself, didn't I?\" she asked,\ntimidly.\n\n\"No. It was all my fault,\" he replied. \"I did it on purpose.\"\n\n\"Perhaps I choked you on purpose, too!\" she answered, blushing again.\n\nNorman looked at her thoughtfully.\n\n\"You know I never saw you blush before. I like it.\"\n\n\"Is it becoming?\" she asked, demurely.\n\n\"Very.\"\n\n\"You know I was never in a man's arms before.\"\n\n\"And you didn't like it?\" he asked, with a smile playing around his\nmouth.\n\n\"To tell you the truth, I found it very awkward.\"\n\n\"Awkward?\" he laughed.\n\n\"And exciting,\" she confessed.\n\n\"Shall we repeat it until you are used to it?\"\n\n\"Thank you, I'm sufficiently amused for to-day,\" she answered,\nsoberly. \"And now we will put on our shoes and be good children.\"\n\nFor the rest of the journey Norman found her strangely silent. Now and\nthen he caught her looking at him furtively out of her big brown eyes,\nas if she had just met him and was half afraid to go further.\n\nHe found himself particularly sensitive to her moods. The moment she\nbecame silent and thoughtful her impulses ruled his, and not a word\nwas spoken for a mile. Scarcely two sentences passed between them\nuntil they reached the summit of the range and sat down on the cliff\noverhanging the sea.\n\nThis cliff was one of the numerous headlands which thrust their peaks\nin almost perpendicular lines sheer into the ocean.\n\nThey sat for an hour and drank in the peace and solemn grandeur of the\ninfinite blue expanse.\n\n\"What a little world, the one in which we live down there and fret and\nfume,\" he whispered. \"The one we think so big when in the thick of the\nfight! We forget the dim expanse of ocean kissing ocean--encircling\nthe earth--of the skies that kiss the sea and lead on and on into\nthose great silent deeps where a universe of worlds roll in grandeur!\"\n\n\"Yet isn't man greater than all these worlds?\" she asked, with sudden\nelation.\n\n\"If he is a man, yes; a real man with the conscious divine power in\nhis soul which says, I will! Isn't that the only power worth having?\nThe herd of cattle we call men, whose souls have never spoken that\ndivine word of character and of action--are they men? Have they souls\nat all? Is it worth the while of those who have to fret and fuss and\nfume trying to make something out of nothing?\"\n\nBarbara turned suddenly, looked into Norman's eyes, and asked in\nanxious tones:\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"That I'm thinking of giving up this experiment.\"\n\n\"Now that you are just making it a marvellous success?\"\n\n\"But is it a success? What is the good of achievement for any\ncommunity if that achievement springs from the will of one man? If\ntheir souls are in subjection to his, has he not degraded them? Is\nlife inside or outside? Are we Socialists not struggling merely with\nwhat is outside? Are we not in reality struggling back into the\nprimitive savage herd out of which individual manhood has slowly\nemerged? I'm puzzled. I'm afraid to go on. I've asked you to come up\nhere to-day to tell me what to do.\"\n\nBarbara's breath came quick.\n\n\"You wish me to decide the momentous question of our colony? Perhaps\nthe future of humanity?\"\n\n\"Yes, just that. You are a woman. Women know things by intuition\nrather than by reason. I'm growing more and more to believe that we\nonly know what we feel. I trust you as I would not trust my own\njudgment just now. I'm going to ask you, in the purity and beauty of\nyour woman's soul, to read the future for me. I'm going to allow you\nto decide this question. Feel with me its difficulties and its\nprospects, trust utterly to your own intuitions, and you will decide\nright.\"\n\nBarbara began to tremble and her voice was very low as she bent toward\nhim.\n\n\"Why do you trust me with the greatest question of your life with such\nperfect faith?\"\n\nHe took her hand, bowed, and kissed it.\n\n\"Because, Barbara, I love you,\" he whispered with passionate\ntenderness.\n\nThe girl looked away and smiled while her heart beat in an ecstasy of\ntriumph.\n\n\"And this is one of the things that has puzzled me most,\" he went on,\nrapidly. \"Every hope and dream my soul has cherished of you has been\nat war with this scheme of herding men and women together. I want you\nall my very own. I want to seize you now in my arms and carry you a\nthousand miles away from every vulgar crowd on earth. A hundred times\nI've been on the point of telling you that I love you, but I drew back\nand sealed my lips. It was treason to the Cause. For how can this\ncause of the herd be one with the heart-cry of the man for the one\nwoman on earth his mate? I've tried to reconcile them, but I can't.\nCome, dearest, you are my nobler, better self, the part of me I've\nbeen searching for and have found. You must answer this cry for light\nand guidance. Your voice shall be to me the voice of God. Shall I go\nback to the faith of my fathers in the old world, and will you come\nwith me--my wife, my mate, my life? Or shall we remain here, and hand\nin hand fight this battle to a finish? The one thing that is\nunthinkable is that I shall lose you. I lay my life at your feet. Do\nwith it as you will.\"\n\nBarbara tried to speak and a sob choked her into silence. She lifted\nher head at last and spoke timidly.\n\n\"I thought it would be easy. But I find it very, very difficult--this\nsettling the destiny of a man. Of one thing I'm sure. You must not\ngive up this work.\"\n\n\"I'll sign the deeds of transfer to-morrow,\" he interrupted.\n\nThe girl's eyes opened in wonder and a feeling of awe stole into her\nheart.\n\n\"You trust me so far?\" she asked, brokenly.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then I must speak softly, must I not? I must weigh every word. You\nfrighten me----\"\n\n\"I'm not afraid. You are the woman I love.\"\n\n\"How long have you loved me?\" she asked, studying him curiously.\n\n\"Always, I think. Consciously since the day I tore that flag down on\nour lawn.\"\n\n\"And yet you drew away from me at times.\"\n\n\"Yes. I felt the irrepressible conflict between this ideal and my\ndesires. Your voice called me to the work. I determined to put the\nwork to the test first----\"\n\n\"And I was the inspiration behind your faith and daring leadership?\"\n\n\"Always.\"\n\n\"You haven't asked me if I love you?\" Barbara said, after a pause.\n\n\"I've been afraid.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Because I don't think you are yet conscious of the meaning of love.\"\n\n\"And yet you place yourself absolutely in my power?\"\n\n\"Absolutely. I love you and I have not made a mistake.\"\n\n\"Frankly, then, I don't know what love means. In my heart of hearts\nI've always been afraid of men----\"\n\n\"You're not afraid of me?\"\n\n\"After to-day--no, I don't think I will be.\"\n\n\"You have made me very happy,\" he cried joyously. \"Come, we must hurry\nback now. I'm going to make out the deeds to-night and place them in\nyour hands to-morrow morning.\"\n\nScarcely a word was spoken as they descended the mountain. She had\ngone up in the morning a laughing girl, conscious of her beauty and\nits cruel power, and determined to use it. She came down a sober\nlittle woman with a great, wondering question growing in her heart.\n\nWhen Wolf met her with eager questions she answered as in a dream.\n\n\"He will deliver the deeds to-morrow?\" he gasped in amazement.\n\n\"Yes, to-morrow,\" she answered mechanically.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII\n\nTHE FRUITS OF PATIENCE\n\n\nThe next morning Norman asked Barbara to take breakfast alone with him\nin the little rose bower on the lawn where she had first announced her\nchoice of work so oddly and charmingly.\n\nShe entered with a timid hesitation and a half-frightened look he was\nquick to note. He was sure from the expression of her eyes that she\nhad not slept.\n\n\"You did not sleep well?\" he asked.\n\n\"I didn't sleep at all,\" she confessed.\n\nHe attempted to take her hand and she drew back trembling.\n\n\"Now, you _are_ afraid of me?\"\n\n\"Yes. I'm afraid I am,\" she stammered.\n\n\"Why of me? The one man of all men on earth--the man who loves you?\"\n\n\"Perhaps that's just why I'm afraid of you,\" she said, with an effort\nto smile. \"But, to tell you the truth, I think it's just because you\nare a man. Last night I lay awake thinking it all over. I'm quite sure\nthat I shall always be afraid of men. I like you better than any man\nI've ever known, but now that you've told me you love me I'm uneasy\nwhen I'm near you. I think you'd better give me up at once. I'm sure\nI'm hopeless as a sweet-heart. I know I could never marry. The\ndomestic instinct seems utterly missing in my nature. I love man in\nthe abstract, but I can never surrender to any particular man. It\nseems like suicide. I want to be myself. I hate the idea of losing\nmyself in another's being--I can't endure it, and if you make love to\nme any more I shall be very unhappy--and--I'll have to keep out of\nyour way. You won't do this any more will you? Promise me, and we will\nbe our old selves again--just comrades.\"\n\nNorman bowed with a smile.\n\n\"I promise never to speak another word of love to you until you tell\nme that you love me!\"\n\n\"Honestly?\" she laughed.\n\n\"On my word of honour,\" he answered, gravely.\n\n\"Then I shall be happy again,\" she cried.\n\n\"You will not try to avoid me?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"You will help and cheer me in the work I've planned?\"\n\n\"Every day,\" she promised.\n\n\"Then I shall bide my time.\" He drew the deeds to the island from his\npocket and handed them to her.\n\n\"The title to a kingdom which I joyfully deliver by order of the\nqueen-regent!\"\n\n\"You are sure you do this because I asked you?\"\n\n\"Do you really doubt it?\"\n\n\"No,\" was the candid reply. \"And I'll be frank enough to confess that\nI feel very proud of my power. You flattered my vanity as never\nbefore. You have put me under a sense of gratitude for which I fear I\ncan never reward you.\"\n\n\"I have my reward in your approval.\"\n\nShe smiled and lifted her finger in warning.\n\n\"I'll not forget my promise,\" he said. \"From to-day we understand each\nother perfectly. I am permitted to love you in silence. You graciously\npermit this as long as I am silent. In my wounded pride I have vowed\nthat you yourself shall break this silence or it shall remain unbroken\nforever. This is our compact?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she answered extending her hand. He felt it tremble at his\nfirst touch and then rest contentedly and confidently in his strong\ngrasp for a moment before they parted.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen once his decision was made, Norman threw every doubt to the winds\nand devoted himself with tireless zeal to establishing the\nBrotherhood on the vast scale he had originally planned.\n\nIn every step of the expanding life of the colony Barbara was his\nconstant companion and silent inspiration.\n\nThe transfer of the property was duly made under Wolf's keen gray\neyes, with every detail of the law carefully guarded.\n\nA second colony of two thousand enthusiasts was landed and established\nin the new building. Under Norman's inspiring leadership their work\nwas quickly organized.\n\nA new central administrative colony of five thousand was planned, and\nthe foundation of its buildings laid with inspiring ceremonies. The\nhuge structure was formed in the shape of a quadrangle covering ten\nacres of ground. In the centre of the court rose the house of the\nregents, in reality a palace of imposing splendour. The assembly hall\nwas located in the regents' palace and formed the dining-room of their\ncolony. At one end of the magnificent room was placed on an elevated\nplatform the table at which the board of governors would sit, while at\neach end of the table stood the gilded chairs of state to be occupied\nby the regent and his consort.\n\nThe scheme of imposing grandeur was suggested by Wolf. Norman objected\nat first, but yielded at last, convinced by his past experiences that\na central authority of undisputed power was essential to the existence\nof any state founded on the socialistic ideal.\n\nAt each corner of the quadrangle a public building was placed\nconnected by the dormitories; on one corner was placed a theatre, on\nanother a music hall, on another a school and nursery, on the other a\nlyceum to be used for public gatherings of all kinds, religious,\nsocial, or political. Each section of the outer buildings was\nconnected with the regent's palace in the centre of the court by\ncovered walk ways.\n\nThe entire force of the four thousand members of the Brotherhood\n(except the farmers) were placed at work to complete this structure at\nthe earliest possible moment.\n\nA day before the annual meeting of the Brotherhood at which the board\nof governors and the two regents were to be elected for the term of\nfour years, Norman established a daily newspaper, _The New Era_, and\nthe event was celebrated in the evening by a banquet and ball.\n\nAs he walked among the joyous throngs of the Brotherhood as they moved\nthrough the brilliantly lighted ball-room he began to feel for the\nfirst time the conscious joy of a great achievement.\n\nBeyond a doubt the Brotherhood was an accomplished fact. Its fame was\nstirring the world beyond their little island. Pictures of the future\nflashed through his imagination, and always in greater and more\nalluring splendour.\n\nHe saw himself becoming more and more the guiding spirit of the great\nenterprise. If men opposed his plans he would mould their wills in\nhis.\n\nGradually he meant to remove the hard and painful elements of force on\nwhich the efficiency of the colony now rested. The discipline of an\narmy with its stern laws of physical violence back of its clock-like\nprecision was not to his liking. He winced at the thought of that grim\nrelic of barbarism, the whipping-post, which they had found necessary\nto temporarily revive. The jail, guard-house, and penal colony were\nthorns in his flesh which he would remove at the earliest possible\nmoment. The one excuse for their existence was the inheritance of evil\nin man's nature due to his wrongs and suffering under the system of\ncapitalism. They would outgrow them.\n\nAgain and again he encountered Wolf and Catherine in the highest\nspirits, laughing, joking, chatting, shaking hands with each one they\nmet.\n\nSuddenly it struck him for the first time that he had a poor memory\nfor names and faces. He wondered how Wolf could remember the name of\nthe most obscure member of the colony without an effort. He had been\nso absorbed in the big problems of the Brotherhood that he had given\nlittle or no time to cultivating the personal acquaintance of its\nindividual members. The arts of the politician were foreign to his\nnature. He had never stooped in his thoughts even to consider them. He\nhad always lived in a different world.\n\nNever for a moment had the idea occurred to him that he might have to\nfight for his position as leader of the colony which he had created,\nyet when he took his seat beside Barbara the following night to\npreside over the annual meeting, he was conscious instantly that\nthrough the crowd of eager faces before him there ran a strong current\nof personal hostility.\n\nIt was a disagreeable surprise. But as he recalled the many unpopular\ndecisions he had been called on to make during the past year it seemed\nbut natural there should be a lingering soreness in some minds. It was\nnot until he saw Wolf in deep consultation with Diggs's glasses, and\nCatherine whispering to the smooth, gray-haired woman who had demanded\nthe expulsion of Blanche, that he knew an organized plot had been\nformed to depose him from power.\n\nHis first impulse was one of blind rage. He recalled now with\nlightning flashes of memory the long hours Wolf and his wife had\nspent in soothing the anger of rebellious and troublesome members. At\nevery public meeting he recalled their smiling faces at the door or\nmoving through the hall. The whole scheme was plain, its low\nchicanery, its shallow hypocrisy, its fawning acceptance of his\nleadership! They had been patiently waiting for him to finish the work\nof strong, legal, invincible, powerful organization to step in and\ntake the reins from his hands.\n\nAnd they had done it with such consummate skill, such infinite care\nand patience, that not one of his own personal followers had\ndiscovered the plot.\n\nWhen the smooth, gray-haired woman rose to nominate candidates for\nregent he knew, before she spoke, the names she would pronounce. He\nlooked at her with a feeling of contempt and to save his life he\ncouldn't recall her name.\n\nShe repeated her address to the chair with angry emphasis:\n\n\"Comrade Chairman!\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon,\" Norman answered, \"but I could not for the moment\nrecall your name. The comrade on my right (the woman without a soul,\nhe added in low tones) has the floor.\"\n\nBarbara started at his tone of anger and whispered:\n\n\"How could you be so rude--what is wrong?\"\n\n\"We are about to retire from office.\"\n\n\"What!\" Barbara gasped as the little woman began to speak.\n\n\"Listen--you will understand,\" he said, with a sudden curve of his\nlip.\n\n\"Comrades,\" the deep, calm voice began, \"I place in nomination for the\noffice of regents for the four ensuing years the names of a man and\nwoman whom every member of the old colony entitled to vote to-night\nhas learned to love and honour--a man and woman whose ripe experience,\nwhose sound judgment, whose sense of right, whose powers of reasoning,\nwhose executive genius will give to us all the guarantee of perfect\njustice and perfect order----\"\n\n\"You bet they will, old girl,\" Tom cried with enthusiasm, waving his\nhand admiringly toward Norman and Barbara.\n\nThe speaker paused, regarded Tom a moment with quiet scorn, and\ncontinued:\n\n\"I have the honour to name for the highest honour in the gift of the\nBrotherhood for the regency of the new State of Ventura Comrades\nHerman and Catherine Wolf.\"\n\n\"What's that you say?\" old Tom yelled with anger, leaping to his feet,\nand glaring around the room in a dazed surprise.\n\nThe old miner was too shrewd a politician to doubt now for a moment\nthe situation. He made the only possible attack on the programme that\npromised results.\n\n\"In view of the fact, feller comrades,\" he shouted, \"that half the\npresent members er this here Brotherhood have not been here long\nenough to vote, I move that in justice to the new members we postpone\nthis election for six months.\"\n\nJoe seconded the motion, and the chairman asked:\n\n\"Are there any remarks on the motion?\"\n\nThe Bard moved as if to rise, when Diggs snatched him back into his\nseat.\n\nAmid a silence that was ominous the chairman put the question:\n\n\"All in favour of postponing this election for six months that our new\nmembers may be able to vote will say 'Aye.'\"\n\nThe response was feeble. Tom and Joe yelled very loudly, but their\neffort was obvious.\n\n\"All in favour say 'No.'\"\n\nThe whole audience seemed to shout in solid trained chorus \"No!\"\n\nTom hastened to nominate Norman and Barbara. The old miner's speech\nwas couched in plain, uncouth words, but they came from the heart and\ntheir rugged eloquence stirred the crowd with surprising power. Diggs\nglanced over the audience through his flashing glasses, and his\nperpetual smile faded into a look of uneasiness as a round of applause\nswept the house.\n\nHe tiptoed to Wolf's side and whispered:\n\n\"Any danger?\"\n\n\"Not the slightest. I want him to get some votes. It's better so.\"\n\nThe programme went through without a hitch. Wolf and Catherine were\nelected regents by an overwhelming majority and a new board of\ngovernors chosen with not a single one whom Norman knew personally.\n\nThe young leader sat in sullen silence, and watched the proceedings\nwith contempt. Barbara looked on in increasing wonder and pain.\n\nWhen the result was announced and the cheering had died away she bent\nher beautiful head close to his and whispered:\n\n\"This is a complete surprise. You believe me?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" he quickly answered, \"and one touch of your hand will rob\ndefeat of its sting.\"\n\nShe pressed his hand with lingering tenderness and sought Catherine\nwith a flash of anger in her brown eyes that boded trouble for the\nhouse of Wolf.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII\n\nTHE NEW MASTER\n\n\nWolf lost no time in demonstrating that he was complete master of the\nsituation.\n\nAt nine o'clock next morning two armed guards, whom he had never seen\nin the house before, entered Norman's room and handed him the first\nofficial order of the new regents. The deposed young leader read it\nwith amusement at first, but as his eyes rested on its brief words of\ncommand, something of their sinister meaning began to dawn in his\nmind.\n\n    \"All citizens of the State of Ventura are ordered to immediately\n    surrender their arms. By order of\n\n                                               \"HERMAN WOLF,\n                                                      \"_Regent_.\"\n\nNorman looked at the revolvers in the holsters of the guards and dryly\nremarked:\n\n\"But the State will kindly continue their use, I see!\"\n\nNorman surrendered his revolver, and his room was searched in every\nnook and corner for weapons he might have concealed.\n\n\"Why this insult?\" he demanded.\n\nThe guardsman saluted.\n\n\"Special orders of the regent, sir. We are to take no man's word for\nit.\"\n\nNorman sat in silence while the men opened his trunks, ransacked his\ndrawers, and searched in every conceivable spot where a weapon of any\nkind might be hid.\n\n\"I could have told you at first that I had no other guns. The entire\ncolony is being disarmed this morning?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, the work will be completed by two o'clock.\"\n\n\"Indeed!\"\n\nThe man fumbled in his pocket and drew out another order.\n\n\"And this one for you personally, sir.\"\n\n\"Oh--after the disarming?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir!\"\n\nNorman read the second order and the lines of his mouth tightened\nsuddenly. The note was brief but to the point:\n\n    \"Comrade Norman Worth will report to the regent at ten o'clock\n    for orders.\n\n                                               \"HERMAN WOLF,\n                                                     \"_Regent_.\"\n\nFor five minutes after the guards had gone Norman stood in silence\nstaring at this order. It was the first he had ever received in his\nlife except the one from his own father which he had disobeyed.\n\nTo be driven into another man's presence to take orders as from a\nmaster to a servant was an idea that had never entered his\nimagination. He had seen such things. He had given orders, but he had\nnever, somehow, counted himself in the class of men who took them.\n\nFor the first time he began to realize the meaning of the work he had\nbeen doing, and began to see how deftly and unconsciously he had been\nforging the chains of a system of irresponsible slavery on his fellow\nmen. While the motive which impelled him was one of unselfish love,\nand he had thought only of their best interest, he saw now in a flash\nwith what crushing cruelty this power could be used.\n\nIt all seemed simple enough when he regarded his own will as the\ncentre and source of power. Now that another man had grasped the lever\nand applied this power, the whole scheme of artificial life which he\nhad created took on a new and darker meaning.\n\nWhat should he do?\n\nHis first impulse was to walk into Wolf's presence, denounce him as a\nscheming scoundrel, and defy his power. That Wolf would fight was not\nto be questioned for a minute. His first act of disarming the colony\nwas a master-stroke, and the longer the young leader thought of it the\nmore hopeless his present situation became.\n\nBeyond a doubt Wolf had been selecting the new regent's guard with the\nsame patience and skill with which he had executed his political coup.\nThis guard was composed now only of his tried and trusted henchmen. A\nsingle false step on Norman's part would simply play into the wily\nbrute's hands, and he would destroy himself at a single stroke.\n\nHe must use his brain. He must fight the devil with fire. He must\nsubmit for the moment, plan and work and wait with infinite patience,\nand when the work of patience was complete, then strike and strike to\nkill.\n\nAnd yet the blood rushed to his heart and strangled with the thought\nof submission to such a man. But there was no other way. He had\nhimself set the trap of steel he now felt crash into his own flesh.\n\nTo appeal to his father was unthinkable--his pride forbade it, even if\nit were possible.\n\nTo escape was out of the question. Every way had been cut and that by\nhis own order. The mail was inspected. The steamer held no\ncommunication with the people of the island. No boat was allowed to\nland, and no boat, even the smallest sail or row boat, was permitted\nto a member of the Brotherhood on any pretext.\n\nBesides, resignation or flight could not be thought of for another\nreason. To retreat now and leave thousands of people behind whom he\nhad led into this enterprise would be the act of a coward.\n\nThere was nothing left except to fight it out on the lines he had\nhimself laid down.\n\nThe one thing that hurt him most was the ugly suspicion that Barbara\nmust have known something of this deeply laid scheme by which the\nWolfs had gained control of the Brotherhood. And yet her surprise had\nbeen genuine, her anger real. He couldn't be mistaken about it. To\nbelieve her capable of such treachery and double-dealing was to doubt\nthe very existence of truth and purity.\n\nAnd yet, when he recalled how little he really knew of her past life,\nwhat dark secrets might lurk in the story of the years she had spent\nunder the same roof with these people, he grew sick at the thought.\n\nHe knew now that the blond beast with the red scar on his neck and the\nslender, dark-eyed madonna-like mate who had always been his shadow\nwere capable of anything. Two people who could smile in treacherous\nsilence for a year and suddenly grip the throat of the man who had\nbeen their best friend, needed no written biography to tell their\npast. It was luminous. And in the glare in which he read it he\nshuddered at the sinister light it threw on the beautiful girl whom\nthey had reared as their own.\n\nHe took from his mantel a little picture made one day in San Francisco\nby a tintype man. It was a singularly beautiful likeness of Barbara,\ntaken on a sudden impulse without a moment's thought or preparation.\nHer laughing face looked out at him, wreathed in a garland of wayward\nringlets of dark brown hair. Truth, sincerity, beauty, intelligence,\nand a childlike innocence were stamped in every line.\n\nA thousand times since he had seen her just like that. And from the\nmoment of their advent on the island this impression of girlish\ninnocence and sincerity had grown rather than decreased. The more he\nsaw of her in the simpler, quieter moments of their association, the\nstronger, deeper, and more tender his love became, and the deeper grew\nhis utter faith in the purity of her soul and body.\n\n\"I'll sooner doubt an angel of God!\" he said at last, as he placed it\nback on the mantel.\n\nHe would see Wolf at once, learn his plans, and then carefully make\nhis own.\n\nHe dressed with care and at the appointed hour rapped for admission at\nthe executive office where the day before he sat as master.\n\nHe was told the regent was busy with others and ordered to wait his\nturn. He flushed with anger, recovered himself, waited a half hour,\nand was ushered into the presence of the new ruler.\n\nWolf sat in the big revolving chair at his desk with conscious dignity\nand power. Two of his guards stood outside the door, grim reminders of\nthe substantial character of the new administration.\n\nNorman seated himself with careless ease without invitation and waited\nfor the older man to speak.\n\nWolf smiled grimly, stroked his thick, coarse reddish beard, and\nlooked at Norman thoughtfully a moment.\n\n\"Well, my boy,\" the regent began, with friendly patronage, \"we'd as\nwell come to the point without ceremony. You are down and out. The new\nboard of governors will do what I wish. I am in supreme command of the\nship of state. Do you want to fight or work?\"\n\n\"It's a poor doctor, Wolf,\" Norman said, coolly, \"who can't take his\nown medicine. I came here to work.\"\n\n\"Congratulations on your good sense!\" the regent replied. \"I've no\ndesire to make trouble for you. I have nothing against you\npersonally. I had to put you out and take command to save the colony\nfrom ruin. You meant well, but you were a bungling amateur, and you\ncan be of greater service in the ranks than in command. I know you\ndon't like me after what has happened, but you don't have to. I'll be\ngenerous. What sort of work would you like to have assigned you?\"\n\n\"Thanks, that's very kind of you, Wolf, I'm sure. I believe the warden\nof every penitentiary is equally generous to all convicts. However,\nthat's a minor detail, seeing that I assisted in the creation of this\nideal world.\"\n\nWolf smashed the desk top with his big fist and suddenly glared at\nNorman, his cold eyes gleaming angrily.\n\n\"Come to the point! I've no time to waste! Have you any choice as to\nthe kind of work to which you wish to be assigned?\"\n\n\"I have a decided choice. Our mines have all failed. I'll redeem the\nfailure by perfecting and completing the big dredge for mining gold\nfrom the low-grade sands on the beach.\"\n\n\"A waste of time and money,\" Wolf snapped. \"I can't afford to spare\nthe men on any more fool inventions. Such things must stop.\"\n\n\"You mean to stop all progress by stopping inventions?\" Norman asked.\n\n\"So far as the State is concerned, yes,\" said the regent, with\nemphasis. \"Under your slipshod administration we spent nearly two\nhundred thousand dollars during the past year on so-called inventions.\nEvery fool in the colony has invented something. Not one in a hundred\nhas produced an idea that is practicable. We cannot afford to waste\nthe capital of the State in such idiocy.\"\n\n\"Give me twenty men and I'll complete the dredge.\"\n\n\"Labour is capital in the Socialist State. I can't afford to waste\nit.\"\n\n\"But you are not wasting it,\" Norman pleaded. \"I've spent sixty\nthousand already on this invention. Unless the machine is completed\nthe capital will be lost to the colony.\"\n\n\"It will be lost anyhow,\" Wolf answered, impatiently. \"Your whole\nconception is a piece of childish folly. You can't make a profit\noperating a dredge in sand containing only twenty cents' worth of gold\nto a ton of dirt.\"\n\n\"I can do better,\" Norman urged with enthusiasm. \"I can make a hundred\nper cent. on the investment if the dirt pans out ten cents to the ton.\nIf it pans twenty cents a ton I can make millions.\"\n\n\"So every crank has claimed for his particular piece of idiocy. I'll\nnot permit another dollar or another day's labour to be thrown away\non any such crazy experiment.\"\n\nNorman's face reddened with a rush of uncontrollable anger.\n\n\"Look here, Wolf, you can't be serious in this.\"\n\n\"I was never more serious in my life,\" the big jaws snapped. \"I am\ngoing to issue an order to-day that hereafter any man or woman who\nconceives an invention can work it out himself without aid from the\nState. They must do this at odd hours after working the required time\neach day. They must put their own money into their machine.\"\n\n\"As the State only has capital,\" Norman protested, \"this means the\npractical prohibition of all invention. No man can with his own hands\nmake the machinery needed in the progress of humanity. We have\nabolished private capital by abolishing rent, interest, and profit. Do\nyou propose thus to stop the progress of the world?\"\n\n\"No,\" Wolf cried with a wave of his heavy hand. \"Let the ambitious\ninventor work at night and build his own machine. I will grant, in my\norder on the subject, to each successful inventor the right to operate\nhis own machine for ten years before it becomes the property of the\nState.\"\n\n\"Suppose he succeeds,\" said Norman, \"under such hard conditions with\nhis own hands and without capital in perfecting an invention of\nenormous value, such as the dredge I have begun, of what use will the\nresults be if he cannot invest them in rent or interest, and all gifts\nand exchanges are prohibited?\"\n\n\"He may build a home and lavish them on his wife and children, or he\nmay become a great public benefactor and win the love and gratitude of\nthe people by enriching the State and shortening the hours of labour.\nIf your dredge can make a million, for example, as you claim--go\nahead, work at night, perfect it, put it to work, build yourself a\npalace to live in, give millions to the Brotherhood. Shorten their\nhours from eight to four, and I'll guarantee you'll oust me from my\nposition of power.\"\n\nNorman's eye suddenly flashed with resolution.\n\n\"You will not grant me the labour to complete the dredge?\" Norman\nasked.\n\n\"Not one man for one minute,\" was the curt reply.\n\n\"Then I'll finish it myself,\" Norman said, with determination.\n\n\"After you've worked eight full hours a day, under my direction--you\nunderstand!\" the regent responded sullenly.\n\nNorman sprang to his feet and the two men faced each other a moment,\nthe big scar on Wolf's neck flashing red, his enormous fists\ninstinctively closing.\n\n\"Wolf, this is an infamous outrage!\"\n\n\"I'll teach you not to speak to me in that manner again, sir!\" the\nregent slowly said, as he tapped his bell.\n\nThe guards sprang to his side.\n\n\"Show this gentleman to the barnyard--he is a good farmer. Put him at\nwork with old Methodist John cleaning out the stables for the new\ncantaloup crop. He is very fond of cantaloups. If he makes any trouble\ntell the sergeant of your guard to give him thirty-nine lashes without\nconsulting me.\"\n\nNorman stepped closer, and, trembling from head to foot, said to Wolf:\n\n\"If ever one of your men lays the weight of his hand on me----\"\n\n\"And yet we both agreed that under our system discipline must be\nenforced--the discipline of an army?\" the regent interrupted.\n\nNorman held his gaze fixed without moving a muscle, and slowly\ncontinued:\n\n\"If you ever try it, you'd better finish your job.\"\n\n\"I'll remember your advice,\" Wolf answered with a sneer. \"Show him to\nhis work.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIX\n\nA TEST OF STRENGTH\n\n\nWhen Catherine saw the furious look on Barbara's face as she descended\nfrom the platform the night of the election, she avoided a meeting and\nwent to bed pleading a headache.\n\nEarly the next morning Barbara rapped for entrance, forced her way in,\nand stood, tense with anger, before the older woman, her eyes red from\nthe long vigil of a sleepless night.\n\n\"You avoided me last night----\"\n\nCatherine laughed.\n\n\"My dear, I never saw you in quite such a rage. It might be serious if\nit were not so silly.\"\n\n\"You'll find it serious before you are through with this performance,\"\nBarbara retorted, angrily.\n\n\"Remember, I am in supreme authority now. Don't you dare speak to me\nin that manner, you ungrateful little wretch!\"\n\n\"I'll dare to tell you the truth--even if you were the mother who bore\nme--even if I had not repaid you a hundredfold for every dollar you\nhave spent on me.\"\n\n\"Hush, hush, my dear, I do not wish to quarrel,\" Catherine said,\nrecovering herself. \"I know your pride is wounded over your defeat.\nI've watched your growing vanity in high office with much amusement\nfor the past year.\"\n\n\"I'm not thinking of myself,\" Barbara said with emphasis.\n\n\"Of course not--what woman ever does?\" Catherine sneered.\n\n\"I am glad to be relieved of the annoyance of such a position. But\nyour treatment of the brave and daring young spirit who conceived this\ncolony and created its wealth and influence----\"\n\n\"Am I responsible?\"\n\n\"Yes. Herman is incapable of conceiving such a plot without your\nsuggestion. It is your work. You have always loved luxury and power.\"\n\n\"Perhaps I love a man also,\" Catherine interrupted, as her full\nsensuous lips curled in a curious smile.\n\n\"Yes, I give you credit for that too,\" the girl admitted. \"Though I\nconfess the secret of your infatuation for that hulking brute has\nalways been one of the black mysteries of life to me.\"\n\n\"When you're older,\" again the round lips quivered with a smile,\n\"perhaps you will understand. And now, my child, I've been patient\nwith you. But don't you ever again call Herman a brute in my\npresence.\"\n\n\"Take care he doesn't prove it to you!\" the girl warned.\n\nCatherine suddenly paled.\n\n\"What do you mean by that?\" she whispered, glancing about the room.\n\n\"Nothing! nothing! nothing! Only that in every deed of the devil there\nis the seed of death. You have planted the seed. The harvest is sure.\"\n\n\"My dear----\"\n\n\"Don't call me that again! I hate you!\" Barbara spoke with deliberate\npassion.\n\n\"Have you gone mad?\" Catherine cried, with impatience.\n\n\"Yes, mad with hatred. From to-day we are enemies, and I'll hate you\nforever!\"\n\nThe older woman looked at her in astonishment and spoke with a\ndeliberate sneer:\n\n\"As you like. Remember, then, from this moment that you are a servant\nunder my command. I am no longer your foster-mother. Leave this room\ninstantly, take your things to the domestic servants' quarters, and\nreport to the head-woman for duty in the corridors of this wing of the\nbuilding.\"\n\n\"And you think I'll submit to this?\" Barbara gasped.\n\nCatherine rang the bell, and Barbara gazed at her with a look of\nmingled terror and rage. A sudden light flashed in her brown eyes.\n\n\"You mean this?\"\n\n\"I'll show you in a moment,\" was the calm reply.\n\n\"Then it's war between us,\" Barbara cried.\n\nShe sprang to the door and Catherine caught her arm.\n\n\"Where are you going?\"\n\n\"To Herman.\"\n\n\"He cannot interfere with my decisions.\"\n\nBarbara threw her off and bounded through the door crying:\n\n\"We shall see!\"\n\nThe girl rushed past the guard at the door of Wolf's office, trembling\nwith rage, her eyes filled with blinding tears.\n\nWolf sprang to his feet in astonishment and met her with outstretched\nhands.\n\n\"What's the matter, child?\" he asked as his big coarse fists closed\nover the hot little fingers and his gray eyes lighted at the sight of\nher dishevelled hair and bare throat.\n\nBarbara choked back the sobs, and looked appealingly into Wolf's face.\n\n\"We have quarrelled about last night. You understand, Herman.\nCatherine has ordered me to leave my room and join the servants in\nthe halls. You--you will not allow me to be degraded thus--will you?\"\n\nWolf drew the trembling girl into his arms, pressed her close a\nmoment, stroked her curls with his gnarled hand, and his face flushed\nwith a look of triumph.\n\n\"Don't worry, dear, I'll protect you,\" he answered, bending and\nkissing her forehead. \"Go back to your room, and if any one dares to\ndisturb you, call for me.\"\n\nBarbara murmured through her tears:\n\n\"Thank you, Herman.\"\n\nWolf's eyes sparkled as he watched the graceful little figure proudly\nleave the room.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXX\n\nA VISION FROM THE HILLTOP\n\n\nCatherine's fight with Wolf was long and bitter. For hours she\nstruggled to force him to leave in her hands the discipline of the\nwomen members of the colony. Her tears and threats fell on ears\nequally deaf to all pleading. At last the guards listening outside\nheard only the low sobbing of a woman's voice near the door for a half\nhour without a sound from the man.\n\nAnd then his short, sharp words came quick and curt and stinging:\n\n\"Are you done now with this fool performance?\"\n\nThe answer was a sob.\n\n\"Understand once for all,\" the cold, hard voice went on, \"I am the\nmaster here. Your office as regent is one of courtesy only as my wife.\nMy word alone is supreme. When you cease to be my wife another regent\nwill be chosen and I do the choosing. I not only propose to do the\nwork of disciplining the women, but it is the one kind of work to\nwhich I shall devote myself with pleasure.\"\n\n\"Herman!\" Catherine sobbed, as if she had sunk beneath a blow.\n\nThe man laughed with brutal enjoyment.\n\n\"You'd as well know this now as later. You can be getting used to it.\"\n\nHer eyes red with weeping, her proud shoulders drooped for the first\ntime in her life, Catherine slowly walked from Wolf's office back to\nher room.\n\nBarbara passed her on the stairs without a word or a glance, and\nhurried again to see the regent, her whole being alert with quick\nintelligence.\n\nThe guard had received instructions that she was the one privileged\nperson in the colony who could enter his office at all hours, day or\nnight, without ceremony or delay. They showed her in immediately.\n\n\"I've just heard of your order sending Norman to the work of a common\nfarm-hand, Herman,\" Barbara began.\n\nWolf scowled.\n\n\"You must not interfere in this little affair between my rival and\nmyself, Barbara,\" he said, sternly.\n\n\"I will interfere,\" she quickly replied, \"both for your sake and his.\nYou've made a serious mistake, Herman. Correct it at once.\"\n\n\"I had to show him his place.\"\n\n\"It isn't fair. The men will resent it. You will make enemies. Your\npower is complete. You can afford to be generous.\"\n\nWolf looked at her with hungry, admiring gaze.\n\n\"Perhaps you're right,\" he said slowly.\n\n\"Of course I'm right!\" she replied, \"and you know it. You've made him\na martyr and a hero on the first day of his fall from power. Your true\npolicy is just the opposite. Let him do what he pleases for a time.\nAbove all things don't put yourself in the position of his enemy. Your\nstrength lies in standing as his patron and friend.\"\n\n\"By Jove, Barbara,\" Wolf cried, \"what a wise head on your little\nshoulders! Come, be honest with me now--you're not in love with this\nman?\"\n\nThe girl smiled demurely:\n\n\"He is with me, I think,\" she admitted.\n\n\"Yes, yes, of course--so we all are,\" he cried, with a smile. \"But you\nhave not accepted his love?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"I thought you had better sense. I'll change my order at your\nsuggestion.\"\n\n\"I knew you would,\" she cried, joyfully.\n\nWolf sat down at his desk and wrote:\n\n    \"Comrade Norman Worth is transferred from the field to the\n    foundry, with permission, after his day's work, to employ his\n    time in the shops perfecting any invention in which he may be\n    interested.\n\n                                                \"WOLF--_Regent_.\"\n\nHe handed the order to Barbara.\n\n\"Take this to the youngster and tell him I did it at your suggestion,\nand hereafter give him a wide berth if you wish to be friendly with\nme.\"\n\nBarbara dropped her eyes and Wolf touched her chin with his coarse,\nshort fingers.\n\n\"A hint to the wise is sufficient, little girl. You understand?\"\n\nBarbara took the order, turned toward the door, paused and smiled\ncoquettishly:\n\n\"I understand, Herman.\"\n\nShe found Norman at work with Methodist John cleaning out a stable. To\nher amazement he was whistling and joking about something with the old\nman. She stopped and listened a moment.\n\n\"But what on earth do you want a lightning-rod for, John?\" Norman\nasked.\n\n\"That's my secret, sir,\" the old man answered, \"but I must have\none--won't you get it for me?\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, John, but I have no more power now in the State of Ventura\nthan you have.\"\n\n\"But didn't you get the million dollars and didn't you make all the\nmoney for 'em--a hundred and fifty thousand dollars on the cantaloups\nthe others didn't have sense enough to plant? Surely they'll give you\nenough to get me a thirty-foot lightning-rod?\"\n\n\"I'm afraid not, John, still I'll do my best. I don't like to press\nyou for the secrets of your inner life, old man, but I've immense\ncuriosity to know what you want with that lightning-rod? You say\nyou're not afraid of lightning?\"\n\n\"No, sir, I'm not afraid of nothin'.\"\n\n\"Then why----\"\n\n\"'Tain't no use in askin' sir, I can't tell ye. But I want it. I'm\ngoing to pray every night for it till I get it. Maybe the Lord will\nsend me one by an angel----\"\n\nBarbara suddenly appeared in the door of the stall.\n\n\"Speaking of angels,\" Norman cried, laughing.\n\n\"I have an order for you,\" Barbara said, quickly.\n\nNorman threw his pitchfork full of manure out of the window of the\nstall, stood the fork in the corner, brushed his hands, and bowed\nbefore Barbara.\n\n\"What an exquisite picture you make standing in the doorway there with\nthat ocean of blossoming peach trees stretching up the slope until it\nkisses the sky line. I wish I were an artist.\"\n\nShe looked at him with amazement.\n\n\"I expected to find you with murder in your heart. I can't\nunderstand.\"\n\nNorman took the note from her white fingers.\n\n\"Because I'm laughing?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Well, isn't the joke on me? I've been preaching, preaching,\npreaching, about the dignity of all labour. I kicked the first few\nmoments, I confess. The medicine was bitter, but I soon began to find\nthat it was good for the soul. I'm getting acquainted with myself----\"\n\nNorman paused, read Wolf's order, and looked tenderly into Barbara's\neyes.\n\n\"So you heard of my fall and came to my rescue. It's worth the jolt to\nbe rescued by such a hand.\"\n\nHe stooped and kissed the tips of her fingers.\n\n\"Come with me up the hill yonder among those blossoming trees,\" he\nsaid, leading her toward the orchard. \"I want to tell you about a\nvision I saw in that stable a while ago while I wielded the pitchfork\nand talked to my old pauper friend, both of us now comrade equals.\"\n\nThey walked on in silence through the long, clean rows of fruit trees\nin full bloom, the air redolent with sweet perfume and quivering with\nthe electric hum of growing life. On the top of the hill they paused\nand looked toward the sea that stretched away in solemn, infinite\ngrandeur. Below, on the next plateau, rolled in apparently endless\nacres, the great white carpet of flowering plum trees and further on\nthe tender budding grapes and beyond, lower still, the deep green\nvalley with orange trees flashing their golden fruit.\n\n\"What a glorious world!\" Barbara cried.\n\n\"Yes,\" he answered with a sigh, \"a world of endless beauty in which\nafter all there's nothing vile but man. And I once thought that in\nsuch a world angels only could live.\"\n\n\"Must we despair because one man or woman proves false,\" she asked.\n\n\"No,\" he answered cheerily, leading her to a boulder and taking his\nseat by her side.\n\n\"I don't despair. I've been seeing visions to-day--visions as old as\nthe beat of the human heart, perhaps, yet always new.\"\n\nHe drew the order of Wolf from his pocket and looked at it.\n\n\"From the moment of my awakening last night from the fool's paradise\nin which I've been living the past year my mind has been at work on\nsolving the one unsolved problem in this dredge to which he refers. It\ncame to me like a flash while at work this morning.\"\n\n\"Your invention will succeed?\" she interrupted.\n\n\"Beyond the shadow of a doubt,\" he said, with enthusiasm. \"I didn't\nsolve it before because I lacked the incentive to apply my mind to\nit.\"\n\n\"And you got the incentive in your defeat?\" she asked, in surprise.\n\n\"Yes. Deprived of my toys, I came back to myself, the source of\npower.\"\n\n\"But your incentive--I don't understand--in such an hour?\"\n\n\"A very simple, very old, but very powerful one, I'm beginning to\nthink, the source of all human progress--the determination to build a\nhome here in one of these flower-robed hills overlooking the sea, and\nbring my bride to it some glorious day like this when every tree is\nfestooned with joy! I don't want a modest cottage. My bride was born a\nqueen. Every line of her delicate and sensitive face proclaims her\nroyal ancestry. She shall have a palace. Love, Beauty, Music, Art, and\nTruth shall be her servants. I shall be the magician who will create\nall this out of the dirt men are now trampling under foot along the\nbeach.\"\n\nBarbara drew a deep breath, trembled, and looked away.\n\n\"I promised her never to speak of love again until her own dear lips\ncalled me, and I will not, though I fear sometimes the waiting seems\nlong.\"\n\n\"And if she never calls?\" the girl asked, dreamily.\n\n\"Then my palace shall remain silent and empty. Her hand alone can open\nits doors.\"\n\n\"And if I do not see you often while your palace is building, you may\nknow at least I have not forgotten--and you will understand?\"\n\n\"Yes, I will understand,\" he answered, with elation.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXI\n\nIN LOVE AND WAR\n\n\nWith untiring zeal Norman gave himself to work on the dredge. Wolf\nrefused to modify his original order that a full day should first be\ngiven as a labourer in the foundry and machine shops before he could\ndevote himself to his invention.\n\nThis proved an advantage rather than a hindrance. By his unfailing\ncourtesy, good fellowship, skill, and wit, Norman won his fellow\nworkmen as warm personal friends. He was able thus to secure all the\nassistance he needed in his work.\n\nWithin two months the big dredge was finished.\n\nFrom the first the regent had regarded Norman's fad with contempt.\nThat he could succeed in making money out of dirt containing but\ntwenty cents' worth of gold to a ton was an absurdity on its face.\n\nWhile the young inventor worked day and night with tireless energy the\nregent quietly perfected his grip on the life of the rapidly growing\ncolony. To render escape from the island or communication with the\ncoast more impossible than ever, he established the strict system of\ndouble patrol around each community. No member of the Brotherhood was\nallowed to leave his room at night without permission. Beyond the\nouter patrol a mounted guard was established and the entire line of\nbeach was guarded by watchmen in relays who reported each hour, day\nand night, by telephone to the commandant.\n\nAt the end of two months of Wolf's merciless rule the efficiency of\nlabour had so decreased, it was necessary to lengthen the number of\nhours from eight to nine. As every inducement to efficiency of labour\nhad been removed there was no incentive to any man to do more than he\nmust without a fight with his guard or overseer. No vote was permitted\non the question of increasing the hours of labour. The board of\ngovernors passed the order which Wolf wrote out for them without a\ndissenting voice.\n\nNorman had no trouble in getting a gang of willing hands to push the\nmonster gold-digger into position on one of the sand-points inside the\nharbour.\n\nIt was mounted on a float twenty-five feet wide and sixty-five feet\nlong. For power it carried two fifty-horse-power distillate engines.\nTom was in charge of one and Joe of the other. For raising the sand\nand gravel containing the gold two big Jackson gravel-pumps were\nlocated on opposite corners at the front end of the float.\n\nOld Tom blew the whistle, the engines started, and in an hour the\npumps had raised a hundred tons of sand and gravel and deposited them\nin the concentrating flumes. Norman worked the dredge all night\nwithout a moment's pause and in twelve hours his pumps had lifted\nfifteen hundred tons of sand, showing a capacity of 3,000 tons per\nday. When the gold was extracted and weighed it was found that the\ndredge had averaged twenty cents from each ton of sand and that it\nwould cost less than three cents a ton to operate the entire machinery\nof its production. The first experimental machine alone would net $500\ndollars a day, or $150,000 a year. He could put five of these machines\nto work in three months and make $3,000 a day.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe invention stirred the colony to its depths. Norman's appearance\nwas the signal for a burst of cheering wherever he went.\n\nWolf was dumfounded. He called his board of governors together at once\nand ordered them to enact a new law to meet the situation.\n\nNorman announced in the _Era_ that he would give the Brotherhood from\nthe beginning one half the net earnings of his machines, and asked\nthe board of governors at once to grant him the men needed to build\nand operate enough dredges to reduce the hours of labour from nine to\nseven.\n\nWolf met the emergency with prompt and vigorous action. He suspended\nthe editor for printing the announcement and set him to work carrying\na hod.\n\nHe issued a proclamation as regent that the dredge in the hands of its\ninventor threatened the existence of the State, declared the law of\ninventions under which it was built suspended, and ordered Norman to\nat once operate the machine for the sole benefit of the State and\nbegin the construction of twenty dredges of equal capacity.\n\nWhen Norman received this order he set to work without a moment's\ndelay and made a half-dozen dynamite bombs, gave one each to Tom and\nJoe and their assistants, laid in a supply of provisions, erected a\ntent on the beach beside the dredge, and set the big machine to work\nfor all it was worth.\n\nWolf promptly ordered his arrest. The men who attempted to execute the\norder fled in terror at the sight of the bombs and reported for\ninstructions.\n\nWolf came in person at the head of a picked company of fifty guards.\n\nNorman had stretched a rope a hundred feet from the dredge and posted\na notice that he would kill any man daring to cross it without his\npermission.\n\nWolf paused at the rope. Norman stood alone on one of the big pumps\nwith his arms folded watching his enemy in silence.\n\nThe captain of the guard laid his hand on the regent's arm:\n\n\"You'd better not try it.\"\n\n\"He won't dare,\" Wolf growled.\n\n\"Yes, he will,\" the captain insisted.\n\n\"I'll risk it,\" the regent snapped.\n\n\"Are you mad? What's the use? He'll blow it up. You can't rebuild the\ndredge--no one understands it. Use common sense. Send the girl with a\nflag of truce and ask for a conference.\"\n\n\"A good idea--if it works,\" Wolf answered hesitating.\n\n\"It's worth trying,\" the captain urged.\n\nWolf returned to the house with his men, and in a few minutes Barbara\ncame to Norman, her face white with terror, her voice quivering with\npleading intensity.\n\n\"Please,\" she gasped, \"for my sake, I beg of you not to do this insane\nthing! The regent asks for a conference under a flag of truce. He\nrecognizes that it is impossible that you should remain here after\nwhat has happened. He asks for a half-hour's talk with you to offer an\nadjustment under which you can resign and return to San Francisco.\"\n\n\"It's a trick and a lie. He's deceiving you,\" Norman replied,\nsullenly.\n\n\"No, I swear it's true. He is in earnest, Catherine is beside herself\nwith fear lest he be killed. He swore to her as he swore to me to\nrespect your wishes. I'll gladly give my life if he proves false.\"\n\nNorman turned his face away and looked over the still, blue waters,\nstruggling with himself as he felt the tug of her soft hand on his\nheart.\n\nSuddenly a hundred men with Wolf at their head sprang over the steep\nembankment and rushed to the dredge. Tom leaped to his feet and lifted\nhis bomb without a word.\n\nNorman covered Barbara and grasped his uplifted arm.\n\n\"It's all over boys. I've surrendered!\" he shouted.\n\nBarbara faced Wolf with blazing eyes:\n\n\"You have betrayed my trust!\"\n\nWolf brushed her aside and confronted Norman, who had thrown the bomb\nhe had taken from Tom's hand into the sea.\n\nNorman paid no attention to Wolf, and seemed to see only the girl's\nface convulsed with passion. His eyes never left her for a moment.\n\nWolf turned and secured the other men who had defended the dredge,\nmarching them with their hands tied behind their backs between two\nrows of guardsmen off to jail.\n\nNorman spoke at last to Barbara in low, cold tones:\n\n\"I congratulate you.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" she gasped.\n\n\"That you are a superb actress. You have played your part to\nperfection. Your r\u00c3\u00b4le was very dramatic, too. A clumsy woman would\nhave bungled it, and lost even at the last moment.\"\n\n\"You cannot believe that I willingly betrayed you?\" she cried, in\nanguish.\n\n\"I wish I had died before I knew it,\" he answered, bitterly.\n\nBarbara pressed close to his side and seized his hand fiercely. He\nturned away with a shudder.\n\n\"Look at me,\" she pleaded.\n\nHe turned and faced her with a look of anger.\n\n\"Words are idle. Deeds speak louder than words.\"\n\n\"Norman, you are killing me with this cruel doubt!\" she sobbed. \"I\ngive up! I love you! I love you!\"\n\nShe threw her arms around his neck and her head sank on his breast.\n\nHe resisted for a moment, then clasped her to his heart, bent and\nkissed her with passionate tenderness.\n\n\"You believe me now?\" she cried, through her tears.\n\n\"God forgive me for doubting you for a moment!\" he answered,\nearnestly.\n\nThe guard suddenly drew Norman from her arms, tied his hands, and led\nhim away to prison while the little figure followed, sobbing in\nhelpless anguish.\n\nWolf walked behind, his big mouth twitching with smiles he could not\nsuppress.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXII\n\nA PRIMITIVE LOVER\n\n\nWolf led Barbara into his office, lighted the lamp, and waited in\npatience for her first blinding surrender to grief to spend itself\nbefore speaking.\n\nHe stood over her at last with a smile, bent and touched her brown\ncurls.\n\nThe girl sprang to her feet and faced him.\n\n\"It's no use, my beauty, I'm on to your tricks now!\"\n\nThe little figure stiffened, and her gaze was steady, though her\nfingers trembled as she nervously twisted the tiny handkerchief she\nheld.\n\n\"You've been playing me for a fool for the past two months. Your eyes\nhave been laughing into mine with all sorts of little daring\nsuggestions when you had an axe to grind at my expense. And then you\nhad a habit of disappearing until you needed something else. You were\noff billing and cooing with our hero and smiling at my stupidity\nbehind my back.\"\n\n\"I've spoken to him to-day,\" Barbara answered solemnly, \"the first\nwords of love that ever passed my lips.\"\n\n\"You did pretty well for an amateur, if that was the first kiss you\never gave him.\"\n\n\"It was the first!\" she said, defiantly.\n\n\"It will be the last for him.\"\n\n\"Perhaps,\" she answered, with a curl to her lips.\n\n\"You think I don't mean it?\" Wolf demanded, stepping close and\nthrusting his massive head forward while his big fists closed.\n\n\"I don't doubt it,\" she answered, firmly. \"But I'm not afraid of you,\nHerman.\"\n\n\"You doubt my power?\" he asked.\n\n\"Over others, no.\"\n\n\"But over you?\"\n\nWolf suddenly grasped her.\n\nThe girl shrank back in terror for an instant, and then, to his\nsurprise, her hand was still and cold and steady. Not a tremor in the\ntense body. Her brown eyes, staring wide, held his gaze without a sign\nof weakness or of fear. Something in her attitude startled the beast\nwithin him. He suddenly dropped her hand and changed his tone.\n\n\"Come, let's not quarrel! Don't be foolish. It is for you I've been\nscheming and planning the past year. For you the regent's palace was\nplanned. Within five years a hundred thousand people will be here.\nThe State will be rich beyond our wildest dreams, and I shall be the\nState. I want you to sit by my side.\"\n\n    [Illustration: \"WOLF GRASPED HER.\"]\n\n\"You say this to me after all that Catherine has been to you and your\nlife?\"\n\n\"And why not? If I no longer love, should I be chained?\"\n\n\"And this is the ideal you came here to build?\" she asked, with scorn.\n\n\"Certainly. It is the essence of Socialism. In my next proclamation I\nshall declare for the freedom of love. Every great Socialist has\npreached this. Marriage and the family form the tap-root out of which\nthe whole system of capitalism grew. The system can never be destroyed\nuntil the family is annihilated. I had thought you a woman whose\nbrilliant intellect had faced this issue and broken the chains of a\ndegrading bourgeois morality.\"\n\n\"The chains of love, I find, are very sweet,\" she interrupted, with\ndreamy tenderness.\n\n\"You talk this twaddle about romantic love? You, the leader of a\nrevolution! Come, you are no longer a child. We are living now in the\nworld of freedom and reality where men and women say the unspoken\nthings and live to the utmost reach of their being, body and soul.\"\n\n\"Is it a world worth living in?\" she asked.\n\n\"Was the old world of family life, of starvation and misery, worth\nliving in?\" Wolf retorted.\n\n\"Perhaps I might have said no an hour ago, but now that my lips have\nmet my lover's the dream of the old family life, with its sanctity and\npurity, begins to call me. And something deep down within answers with\na cry of joy. Why should you desire me, knowing that I thus love\nanother?\"\n\n\"You can love where you like,\" he snapped, as his big jaws came\ntogether. \"I can get along without your love. I just want you--and I'm\ngoing to have you!\"\n\n\"I'll die first!\"\n\n\"We shall see. Time works wonders.\"\n\nWith a shudder Barbara turned and left him.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIII\n\nEQUALITY\n\n\nBarbara asked Wolf for permission to visit Norman in prison.\n\nThe Regent shook his head.\n\n\"No, my little beauty, it's not wise. I promise you that not a hair of\nhis head shall be harmed. He is safe and well. If you wish to test my\npower, try to bribe my guards and see him.\"\n\nDay after day Barbara sought in vain to gain admittance to the jail,\nsend or receive a message from within. Her lover had disappeared as\ncompletely as if the earth had opened and swallowed his body.\n\nThe episode of the dredge was the last effort to question the power of\nthe regent. The day after its capture Wolf put the men who had helped\nNorman build it to work operating the big machine, and its huge pumps\nbegan to throb in perfect time, piling ton on ton of gold-bearing sand\nand gravel into the flumes, as faithful to the touch of the thief who\nhad stolen it as to the hand of the man of genius who invented it.\n\nThe head machinist he ordered to build five duplicates, and placed\nthe entire working force of the mechanical department at once on the\njob.\n\nThe daily _New Era_ received a number of protests against the outrage\nof the inventor's arrest and imprisonment. Two protests were signed by\nthe names of the writers, Diggs and the Bard. There appeared in the\npaper a warning editorial against sneaks who, under cover of the cause\nof justice, were seeking to aid treason and rebellion against the\nState.\n\nDiggs and the Bard were summoned before Wolf in person.\n\nThe regent fixed his gray eyes on Diggs, and the man of questions\nforgot to smile.\n\n\"You are not dealing with an amateur now, Diggs,\" Wolf said, with a\nsneer. \"The insulting letter you wrote----\"\n\n\"I--I--beg your pardon, Mr. Regent,\" Diggs stammered, \"my questions\nwere asked in the spirit of honest inquiry.\"\n\n\"I understand their spirit, sir,\" Wolf growled. \"And don't you\ninterrupt me again when I'm talking! Your article was seditious. I've\na mind to imprison you a year, but as this is your first offence I'll\nsimply transfer you from the department of accounts to that of garbage\nand sewerage. Report at once to the overseer.\"\n\nDiggs's lips quivered and he tried to speak, but Wolf froze him with a\nlook and he dropped to a seat.\n\n\"I said report at once, sir, to the overseer of the department of\ngarbage and sewerage. Did you hear me?\" Wolf thundered.\n\nDiggs leaped to his feet stammering and retreating.\n\n\"Yes, sir! Yes, sir! Excuse me. I was only waiting for Comrade Adair,\nsir! Excuse me, sir, I'll go at once!\"\n\nHe stumbled through the door and disappeared.\n\nThe Bard of Ramcat watched this scene with increasing terror. He had\nprepared an eloquent and daring appeal for freedom of speech. He tried\nto open his mouth, but Wolf's gaze froze the blood in his veins. His\ntongue refused to move. He sat huddled in a heap, trembling and\nshifting uneasily in his seat.\n\nAt length the regent spoke with sneering patronage:\n\n\"You wield a facile pen, Adair. I admire the glib ability with which\nyou pour out gaseous matter from your overheated imagination.\"\n\nThe Bard scrambled to his feet and bowed low in humble submission,\nfumbling his slouch hat tremblingly.\n\n\"I meant no harm, sir, I assure you. A great leader of your power and\ngenius can make allowances for poetic fervour. I'm sure you know that\nmy whole soul is aflame with enthusiasm for our noble Cause!\"\n\n\"Well, upon my word,\" Wolf laughed, \"you're developing into a nimble\nliar! You used to be quite brutal in the frankness of your\ncriticisms.\"\n\n\"But I see the error of my way, sir,\" the Bard humbly cried.\n\n\"Then I'll remit your prison sentence also and merely transfer you to\nthe stone-quarry. We need more common labourers on the rock-pile there\npreparing the macadam for the court of the regent's palace. Report at\nonce to the foreman of that gang.\"\n\n\"Thank you, sir,\" the Bard stammered, feebly, as he backed out of the\nroom.\n\nThe poet bent his proud back over the stone-pile for two weeks and\nsuddenly disappeared.\n\nHis hat was found on a rustic seat on a high cliff whose perpendicular\nwall was washed by the sea. Beneath this hat lay his last manuscript\nprotest to the world. It was entitled:\n\n\"The Journal of Roland Adair, Bard of Ramcat.\" It was written in blank\nverse and proved a most harrowing recital of the horrors he had\nsuffered at the hands of the tyrant regent. With eloquence fierce and\nfiery he called on the slaves who were being ground beneath his heel\nto rise in their might and slay the oppressor. He had chosen to die\nthat his death-song might stir their souls to heroic action.\n\nSearch was made on the beaches for his body in vain. His wife's grief\nwas genuine and a few of his friends gathered with her on the tenth\nday after his disappearance to express their sorrow and appreciation\nin a brief formal service.\n\nDiggs was delivering a funeral oration bombarding Death, Hell, and the\nGrave with endless questions, when suddenly the Bard appeared, pinched\nwith hunger, his clothes covered with dirt, his long hair dishevelled\nand unkempt. He had evidently been sleeping in the open.\n\nHis friends stood in wonder. His wife shrieked in terror.\n\nThe Bard solemnly lifted his hand and cried:\n\n\"I stood on the hills and waited for slaves to rise and fight their\nway to death or freedom. And no man stirred! Did they not find my\ndeath-song?\"\n\nDiggs spoke in timid accents:\n\n\"The regent destroyed it.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, but before my death I anticipated his treachery. I left ten\nmimeographed copies where they could be found by the people. If they\nhave not been found my death would have been vain. I waited to be\nsure. I've come to ask.\"\n\n\"They were found all right,\" his wife cried, angrily. \"And if Wolf\nfinds you now----\"\n\nShe had scarcely spoken when an officer of the secret service suddenly\nlaid his hand on the Bard's shoulder and quietly said:\n\n\"Come. We'll give you something to sing about now worth while!\"\n\nHis wife clung to the tottering, terror-stricken figure for a moment\nand burst in tears. His friends shrank back in silence.\n\nThe regent had him flogged unmercifully; and Roland Adair, the Bard of\nRamcat, ceased to sing. He became a mere cog in the wheel of things\nwhich moved on with swift certainty to its appointed end.\n\nThe social system worked now with deadly precision and ceaseless\nregularity. No citizen dared to speak against the man in authority\nover him or complain to the regent, for they were his trusted\nhenchmen. Men and women huddled in groups and asked in whispers the\nnews.\n\nDisarmed and at the mercy of his brutal guard, cut off from the world\nas effectually as if they lived on another planet, despair began to\nsicken the strongest hearts, and suicide to be more common than in the\ndarkest days of panic and hunger in the old world.\n\nA curious group of three huddled together in the shadows discussing\ntheir fate on the day the Bard was publicly flogged.\n\nUncle Bob led the whispered conference of woe.\n\n\"I tells ye, gemmens, dis beats de worl'! Befo' de war I wuz er slave.\nBut I knowed my master. We wuz good friends. He say ter me, 'Bob\nyou'se de blackest, laziest nigger dat ebber cumber de groun'! And I\nlaf right in his face an' say, 'Come on, Marse Henry, an' le's go\nfishin'--dey'll bite ter-day'! An' he go wid me. He nebber lay de\nweight er his han' on me in his life. He come ter see me when I sick\nan' cheer me up. He gimme good clothes an' a good house an' plenty ter\neat. He love me, an' I love him. I tells ye I'se er slave now an' I\ndon't know who de debbil my master is. Dey change him every ten days.\nDey cuss an' kick me--an' I work like a beast. Dis yer comrade\nbusiness too much fer me.\"\n\n\"To tell you the truth, boys,\" said a bowed figure by old Bob's side,\n\"I lived in a model community once before.\"\n\n\"Oh, go 'long dar, man, dey nebber wuz er nudder one!\" Bob protested.\n\n\"Yes. We all wore the same thickness of clothes, ate the same three\nmeals regularly, never over-ate or suffered from dyspepsia; all of us\nworked the same number of hours a day, went to bed at the same time\nand got up at the same time. There was no drinking, cursing,\ncarousing, gambling, stealing, or fighting. We were model people and\nevery man's wants were met with absolute equality. The only trouble\nwas we all lived in the penitentiary at San Quentin----\"\n\n\"Des listen at dat now!\" Bob exclaimed.\n\n\"Yes, and I found the world outside a pretty tough place to live in\nwhen I got out, too. I thought I'd find the real thing here and\nslipped in. What's the difference? In the pen we wore a gray suit.\nWe've got it here with a red spangle on it. There they decided the\nkind of grub they'd give us. The same here. There we worked at jobs\nthey give us. The same here. There we worked under overseers and\nguards. So we do here. I was sent up there for two years. It looks\nlike we're in here for life.\"\n\n\"How long, O Lord, how long, will Thy servant wait for deliverance?\"\ncried Methodist John, in plaintive despair. \"If I only could get back\nto the poorhouse! There I had food and shelter and clothes. It's all\nI've got here--but with it work, work, work! and a wicked, sinful,\ncussin' son of the devil always over me drivin' and watchin'!\"\n\nJohn's jaw suddenly dropped as a black cloud swept in from the sea and\nobscured the sun. A squall of unusual violence burst over the island\nwith wonderful swiftness. The darkness of twilight fell like a pall,\nand a sharp peal of thunder rang over the harbour.\n\nJohn watched the progress of the storm with strange elation, quietly\nwalked through the blinding, drenching rain to the barn, and drew from\nthe forks of two trees a lightning-rod about thirty feet long which\nNorman had finally made for him in answer to his constant pleading.\nThe tip of the rod was pointed with a dozen shining spikes.\n\nJohn seized this rod, held it straight over his head, and began to\nmarch with firm step around the lawn. He walked with slow, measured\ntread past the two big colony houses to the amazement of the people\nwho stood at the windows watching the storm. He held his lightning-rod\nas a soldier a musket on dress-parade, his eyes fixed straight in\nfront. As he passed through the floral court between the two buildings\nhe burst into an old Methodist song, his cracked voice ringing in\nweird and plaintive tones with the sigh and crash of the wind among\nthe foliage of the trees and shrubbery:\n\n    \"I want to be an angel,\n      And with the angels stand,\n    A crown upon my forehead,\n      A harp within my hand.\"\n\nOver and over he sang this stanza with increasing fervour as he\nmarched steadily on through every path around the buildings, his\nrain-soaked clothes clinging to his flesh and flopping dismally about\nhis thin legs. As the storm suddenly lifted he stopped in front of the\nkitchen, dropped his rod, and sank with a groan to his knees taking up\nagain his old refrain:\n\n\"How long, O Lord, how long?\"\n\nOld Bob ran out and shook him.\n\n\"Name er God, man, what de matter wid you? Is you gone clean crazy?\nWhat you doin' monkeyin' wid dat lightnin'-rod?\"\n\nJohn lifted his drooping head and sighed:\n\n\"You see, neighbour, I don't like to kill myself. It's against my\nreligion. It seems like taking things out of the hands of God. But I\nthought the Lord, in His infinite wisdom and mercy, might be kind\nenough to spare me a bolt if I lifted my rod and put myself in the\nway. If he had only seen fit to do it, I'd be at rest now in the\ncourts of glory!\"\n\n\"Dis here's a sad worl', brudder,\" Bob said comfortingly. \"'Pears lak\nter me de Lawd doan' lib here no mo'.\"\n\nBefore John could reply, a guard arrested him for disorderly conduct.\nThe regent kicked him from his office and ordered him to prison on a\ndiet of bread and water for a week.\n\nThe slightest criticism of his reign Wolf resented with instant and\ncrushing cruelty. His system of spies was complete and his knowledge\nof every man's attitude accurate and full. Where-ever he appeared, he\nreceived the most cringing obeisance.\n\nEspecially did women tremble at his approach and count themselves\nhappy if he condescended to smile.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIV\n\nA BROTHER TO THE BEAST\n\n\nAt the end of three months from the time he took possession of the\ndredge, Wolf's men had built five duplicates, and they were all at\nwork. More than three thousand dollars' worth of gold he weighed daily\nand stored in secret vaults whose keys never left his grasp.\n\nThe new colony he landed in groups of two hundred at intervals of\nsufficient time to assign each new member to work where the least\ntrouble could be given. The strictest search for arms and weapons of\nevery kind was made before each person was allowed to land.\n\nIt took only about two weeks to bring the new group into perfect\nsubjection. Spies reported every word of surprise and criticism that\nfell from the lips of a newcomer.\n\nThe overseer of each gang of labourers was required to complete the\ntask assigned to him by the standard of the very best records labour\nhad ever made, and to secure these results it was necessary to\nconstantly lengthen the hours of each day's service. As the efficiency\nof labour decreased the entire colony gradually gravitated to the\nbasis of convict service. As no man received more than food, clothes,\nand shelter there could be no conceivable motive to induce any one to\nwork harder than was necessary to escape the lash of the overseer.\nConsequently the hours of labour were increased from nine to ten.\n\nThe one ambition now of every man was to win the favour of the\nauthorities, and become one of the regent's guard, an overseer, or\nfind relief from the hard, brutal tasks imposed on the great majority.\nThe road to promotion could not be found in achievement.\n\nThe power to assign and enforce work was the mightiest force ever\ndeveloped in the hand of man.\n\nUnder the system of capitalism wealth was desirable because it meant\npower over men. But this power was always limited. Under the free play\nof natural law no man, even the poorest, could be commanded to work by\na superior power. He could always quit if he liked. He might choose to\ngo hungry, or apply to the charity society for help in the last\nresort, but he was still master of his own person. His will was\nsupreme. He, and he alone, could say, I will, or I will not.\n\nHere all was changed. A new force in human history had been created.\nWealth beyond all the dreams of passion and avarice was in the grasp\nof the regent and his henchmen. He wielded the most autocratic and\nmerciless power over men conceivable to the human imagination--a power\nfinal and resistless, from which there could be no appeal save in\ndeath itself.\n\nThe results of this power quickly began to show in the development of\nlife around the regent and each of his trusted minions.\n\nBy the time the theatre and music hall were finished and opened, Wolf\nhad selected more than a hundred of the prettiest girls in the colony\nfor the two stages.\n\nHis method of selection was always the same. The girl he desired he\nsecretly ordered to be assigned to a dirty or disgusting form of\nlabour. He allowed her to rave in hopeless anger at her tasks until\nshe found that all appeal was in vain and her doom sealed.\n\nHe then made it his business to call, express his surprise at the task\nto which she had been assigned, and smile vaguely at her eager appeal\nfor a change.\n\nIf she proved charming to the regent she was promptly assigned to the\nchorus of the State theatre and given luxurious quarters in the\nbuilding adjoining.\n\nTheir tasks were light and agreeable. They studied music and dancing\nand elocution. But, above all, they studied day and night the art of\npleasing the regent, whose frown could send any of them instantly to\nthe washtub or the scrubbing-brush.\n\nIn like manner around the personality of each guard, overseer,\nsecret-service man, superintendent, and governor of departments there\ngrew a coterie of favoured ones whose position depended solely on the\nwhim of the man in power.\n\nThe State only could manufacture arms. The State only could bear arms.\nAnd the system of law which Socialism developed was so full, so minute\nin its touch on every detail of human life, and so merciless in its\nsystem of espionage, the very idea of revolution was slowly dying in\nthe despairing hearts of the colonists.\n\nSo sure was Wolf of his victim when once he had marked her, he was\nmerely amused rather than displeased over Barbara's defiance of his\nwishes.\n\nA few days before the opening and dedication of the regent's palace,\nwhen all his preparations were complete, Wolf summoned Catherine.\n\n\"I have here,\" he began, \"my proclamation for the complete\nestablishment of a perfect Social State. I publish it to-morrow\nmorning. It goes into effect immediately:\n\n\"'From to-day the State of Ventura enters upon the reign of pure\nCommunism which is the only logical end of Socialism. All private\nproperty is hereby abolished. The claim of husband to the person of\nhis wife as his own can no longer be tolerated. Love is free from all\nchains. Marriage will hereafter be celebrated by a simple declaration\nbefore a representative of the State, and it shall cease to bind at\nthe will of either party. Complete freedom in the sex-relationship is\nleft to the judgment and taste of a race of equally developed men and\nwomen. The State will interfere, when necessary, to regulate the\nbirth-rate and maintain the limits of efficient population.'\"\n\n\"Which means for me?\" Catherine inquired.\n\n\"That you are divorced and free to marry whom you please.\"\n\nThe woman uttered a cry of anguish, threw her arms around Wolf's big\nneck, and burst into sobs.\n\n\"Oh, Herman, surely you have some pity left in your heart! For God's\nsake, don't cast me out of your life in this cruel, horrible way!\"\n\nHe turned his stolid face away with cold indifference.\n\nShe lifted her tapering hand timidly and smoothed the coarse hair back\nfrom his forehead with a tender gesture.\n\n\"Can you forget,\" she went on, in low, passionate tones, \"all we have\nbeen to one another through the long, dark years of our fight with\npoverty and oppression? All I have done for your sake? That I broke\nmy husband's heart--for he loved me even as I love you--I left my\nbabies, and have never seen them since; broke with every friend and\nloved one on earth for you! Have you forgotten all I have done in this\nwork? The tireless zeal with which I've fought your battles? Can you\nkick me from your presence now as though I were a dog?\"\n\nWolf pursed his thick lips and scowled.\n\n\"No, I mean that you shall stay where you are and take charge of my\nnew household. Barbara will need your assistance.\"\n\n\"Barbara!\" she gasped.\n\n\"I have chosen her as the new regent,\" Wolf calmly answered. \"I will\nannounce our marriage at the dedication of the palace.\"\n\n\"And you think that I will accept such shame?\"\n\n\"I'm sure you will!\" he quickly answered with an ominous threat in his\ntone.\n\nThe woman sprang to her feet and faced him, her tall, lithe figure\ntense with passion.\n\n\"I dare you to try it!\"\n\n\"Dare?\" Wolf repeated in a low growl.\n\n\"I said it!\" she cried, defiantly. \"From the very housetop I'll shout\nthe story of our life. I'll show you I'm a power you must reckon\nwith----\"\n\n\"And I'll show you,\" Wolf answered \"that there's but one power that\ncounts now in the world of realities in which we live--the elemental\nforce of tooth, and nail, and claw--do you understand?\"\n\nHe thrust his big, ugly face into hers and a look of terror flashed\nfrom her eyes as she saw his features convulsed with fury.\n\n\"Please, Herman!\" she pleaded at last in a feeble, childish voice.\n\n\"You are still daring me?\"\n\n\"No, I give up--surely you will not strike me!\" she gasped.\n\n\"Not unless I have to,\" he answered, with cold menace.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXV\n\nLOVE AND LOCKSMITHS\n\n\nBarbara sat in the little rose bower on the lawn puzzling her brain\nfor the thousandth time over impossible schemes to communicate with\nNorman.\n\nFrom day to day she had watched with increasing fear the rapid growth\nof Wolf's cruel instincts under the conditions of tyranny he had\nestablished.\n\nShe had appealed in vain to every man in authority. Everywhere the\nsame answer. The regent's power inspired a terror which no appeal\ncould penetrate.\n\nShe started with a sudden thought. Among the guards who stood watch at\nWolf's door was the nineteen-year-old boy who had acted as usher and\nshown Norman to a seat in the Socialist Hall the night they met.\n\nShe had caught a peculiar look in his face the last time she entered\nWolf's office. Could it be possible he was in love with her in the\nhelpless, heroic, boy fashion of his age? She would put him to the\ntest. It was worth trying.\n\nShe found him on guard in the corridor outside Wolf's door,\napproached him cautiously, touched his hand timidly, and whispered:\n\n\"Jimmy, I'm in great distress.\"\n\n\"I wish I could help you, Miss Barbara,\" he answered in low, earnest\ntones, sweeping the corridor with a quick look.\n\n\"Even at the risk of your life?\"\n\n\"I'd jump at the chance to die for you!\" was the simple answer.\n\nBarbara's voice choked and her little hand caught the boy's\ngratefully. His conquest was too easy, his love too big and generous!\n\"I wish I could do it, Jimmy, without letting you risk your life, but\nI must see Norman.\"\n\n\"I'll help you if I can, Miss Barbara, but I don't know how. The\njailer won't let me in without an order from the regent.\"\n\n\"I'll go in now,\" she went on, \"get a piece of paper from his desk,\nforge the order, and sign his name. I can imitate his handwriting.\nI'll give it to you immediately, and watch until you get back to your\npost.\"\n\n\"I'll do it!\" the boy answered, his eyes shining.\n\n\"Tell Norman,\" Barbara whispered, \"that I have found Saka in the\nhills. He has built a skiff and has it ready to sail with his message\nfor relief.\"\n\n\"I understand.\"\n\nShe entered Wolf's office unannounced and surprised him with her\ngirlish buoyancy of spirit.\n\nWith a light laugh she sprang on his big desk, sat down among his\npapers, and deftly closed her hand over one of his small official\norder-pads.\n\n\"I cannot see Norman, to-day?\" she asked.\n\n\"Not to-day, my dear. A little later, yes, but not to-day!\"\n\nHe laughed carelessly and turned in his armchair to a messenger:\n\n\"Take that order to the captain of the guard and tell him to report to\nme at seven o'clock to-night.\"\n\nWhile he spoke, the girl slipped from her place on the desk and thrust\nthe order pad in her pocket.\n\n\"Then I'm wasting breath to plead with you?\"\n\n\"Decidedly. But I congratulate you on the rational way you are\nbeginning to look at things.\"\n\nAs she moved to the door she smiled over her shoulder: \"Time will work\nwonders, perhaps!\"\n\n\"I told you so,\" he laughed.\n\nShe hurried to her room and wrote the order signing Wolf's name\nwithout a moment's hesitation:\n\n    \"Admit the guard bearing this order for the delivery of a\n    personal message to the prisoner, Norman Worth.\n\n                                                \"WOLF--_Regent_.\"\n\nShe stood at the window and watched the boy enter the jail. He stayed\nan interminable time! Each tick of the tiny watch in her hand seemed\nan hour. One minute, two, three, four, five minutes slowly dragged.\nMerciful God, would he never return? A thousand questions began to\nstrangle her. Had Wolf suspected and played with her? Had the jailer\nrecognized the trick and arrested the boy? Had Wolf discovered the\nboy's absence from his post?\n\nShe looked at her watch again. He had been gone seven minutes! The\ndoor of the jail suddenly opened and the boy appeared.\n\nHer hand was tingling with a curious pain. She looked, and the nails\nof her fingers had cut the flesh as she had stood in agony counting\nthe seconds.\n\nThe boy walked with leisurely precision as though on an ordinary\nerrand for the regent. Barbara waited until he resumed his position on\nguard at the door and quickly reached his side.\n\nHe pressed a note into her hand, whispering:\n\n\"The jailer held me up at first--but I found him!\"\n\nBarbara glanced down the corridor with a quick look threw her arms\naround the boy's neck and kissed him tenderly.\n\nHe smiled, drew a deep breath, and said:\n\n\"Now, I'm ready to die!\"\n\n\"No. To live and fight,\" she cried. \"Fight our way back to freedom.\nYou must help me!\"\n\nShe turned and flew to her room. The note in her hand was burning the\nsoft flesh.\n\nShe locked her door and read:\n\n    \"HEART OF MY HEART:\n\n    \"Iron bars have held my body but my soul has been with you! I've\n    seen you walking among the flowers a hundred times and tried to\n    force my message through the walls. I enclose a telegram to my\n    father and one to the Governor of California. Send Saka to Santa\n    Barbara with them. The troops should arrive in forty-eight\n    hours. All I ask of God now is the chance to fight. I love you!\n\n                                              \"Always yours,\n                                                         NORMAN.\"\n\nShe kissed the note, tore it into fragments, and burned the pieces.\n\nWhen night had fallen, Jimmy safely passed the patrol lines, delivered\nhis message to Saka, helped him launch the skiff, watched the little\nsail spread before a fair wind, and returned to his post.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVI\n\nTHE SHINING EMBLEM\n\n\nWhen Wolf's patrol telephoned two days later that a company of troops\nhad suddenly landed on the other side of the island, he called the\ncaptain of the guard:\n\n\"A detail of men to move the gold aboard the ship. Order the steam up.\nI'll divide with you. We must beat those soldiers back until we can\nsail. Fight them at every possible stand as they cross the hills. I'll\njoin you if the guard is driven in.\"\n\nThe captain hurried to execute Wolf's orders, while the regent began\nwith feverish haste to transfer the treasures of the colony to the\nship.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNorman sat on his cot in prison, awaiting anxiously the first sound of\nthe troops.\n\nHe suddenly leaped to his feet.\n\n\"They are coming!\"\n\nListening a moment intently, he cried:\n\n\"There it is again--the scream of fifes from the hills!--now, they are\ndriving in the pickets--hear the crack of those rifles!--God in\nheaven, isn't it music!\"\n\nHe sank back on the cot with a sob of joy.\n\nIn a rush the troops surrounded the jail. The sheriff lifted his hand\nand shouted:\n\n\"In the name of the peace and dignity of the State of California----\"\n\nWolf answered with a defiant wave and charged at the head of his\nguard. The soldiers poured into their ranks a deadly fire. At the\nfirst volley the leader fell. The charging column hesitated, halted,\nthrew down their arms, and surrendered.\n\nIn five minutes Colonel Worth entered the jail and father and son\nsilently embraced. Barbara followed and Norman clasped her in his\narms.\n\nA shout rose from the troops and the group within moved to the prison\nwindow. The colour-sergeant had hauled down the red ensign of\nSocialism from the flag-staff on the lawn and lifted the Stars and\nStripes in its place.\n\nNorman's hand sought his father's. They clasped a moment tremblingly,\nand, still looking through the barred window at the shining emblem in\nthe sky, the young man slowly said:\n\n\"It _is_ beautiful, isn't it Governor!\"\n\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\nBOOKS ON NATURE STUDY BY\n\nCHARLES G.D. ROBERTS\n\nHandsomely bound in cloth. Price, 75 cents per volume, postpaid.\n\n    =THE KINDRED OF THE WILD. A Book of Animal Life. With\n      illustrations by Charles Livingston Bull.=\n\nAppeals alike to the young and to the merely youthful-hearted. Close\nobservation. Graphic description. We get a sense of the great wild and\nits denizens. Out of the common. Vigorous and full of character. The\nbook is one to be enjoyed; all the more because it smacks of the\nforest instead of the museum. John Burroughs says \"The volume is in\nmany ways the most brilliant collection of Animal Stories that has\nappeared. It reaches a high order of literary merit.\"\n\n\n    =THE HEART OF THE ANCIENT WOOD. Illustrated.=\n\nThis book strikes a new note in literature. It is a realistic romance\nof the folk of the forest--a romance of the alliance of peace between\na pioneer's daughter in the depths of the ancient wood and the wild\nbeasts who felt her spell and became her friends. It is not fanciful,\nwith talking beasts; nor is it merely an exquisite idyll of the beasts\nthemselves. It is an actual romance, in which the animal characters\nplay their parts as naturally as do the human. The atmosphere of the\nbook is enchanting. The reader feels the undulating, whimpering music\nof the forest, the power of the shady silences, the dignity of the\nbeasts who live closest to the heart of the wood.\n\n\n    =THE WATCHERS OF THE TRAILS. A companion volume to the \"Kindred\n      of the Wild.\" With 48 full page plates and decorations from\n      drawings by Charles Livingston Bull.=\n\nThese stories are exquisite in their refinement, and yet robust in\ntheir appreciation of some of the rougher phases of woodcraft. \"This\nis a book full of delight. An additional charm lies in Mr. Bull's\nfaithful and graphic illustrations, which in fashion all their own\ntell the story of the wild life, illuminating and supplementing the\npen pictures of the authors.\"--_Literary Digest._\n\n\n    =RED FOX.

With 50\n      illustrations, including frontispiece in color and cover\n      design by Charles Livingston Bull.=\n\nA brilliant chapter in natural history. Infinitely more wholesome\nreading than the average tale of sport, since it gives a glimpse of\nthe hunt from the point of view of the hunted. \"True in substance but\nfascinating as fiction. It will interest old and young, city-bound and\nfree-footed, those who know animals and those who do not.\"--_Chicago\nRecord-Herald._\n\n\nGROSSET & DUNLAP, Publishers, New York\n\n\n\n\nFAMOUS COPYRIGHT BOOKS\n\nIN POPULAR PRICED EDITIONS\n\nRe-issues of the great literary successes of the time, library size,\nprinted on excellent paper--most of them finely illustrated.

The History of My Regeneration, by Owen\n      Kildare. Illustrated.=\n\nThis _autobiography_ is a powerful book of love and sociology. Reads\nlike the strangest fiction.

When the tale is told, the sick\nhealed, wrong changed to right, poverty of purse and spirit turned\ninto riches, lovers made worthy of each other and happily united,\nincluding Carolina Lee and her affinity, it is borne upon the reader\nthat he has been giving rapid attention to a free lecture on Christian\nScience; that the working out of each character is an argument for\n\"Faith;\" and that the theory is persuasively attractive.\n\nA Christian Science novel that will bring delight to the heart of\nevery believer in that faith. It is a well told story, entertaining,\nand cleverly mingles art, humor and sentiment.\n\n\n    =HILMA, by William Tillinghast Eldridge, with illustrations by\n      Harrison Fisher and Martin Justice, and inlay cover.=\n\nIt is a rattling good tale, written with charm, and full of remarkable\nhappenings, dangerous doings, strange events, jealous intrigues and\nsweet love making.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp:\/\/pglaf.org\/fundraising.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":1260,"split":"test"}
