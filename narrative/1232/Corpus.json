{"ori_id":"54e7219964513efc449b07327b717c600c609115","title":"Real Genius","context":"Real Genius\n A group of CIA officers watch a video presentation of a top-secret project called \"Crossbow\": a space shuttle mounted with a computer-guided laser weapon capable of incinerating a man on the ground with pinpoint accuracy. Researchers on the project have yet to devise a system to generate enough power to operate it. When it becomes clear that this weapon has no wartime applications and is intended solely for illegal assassinations, one agent decries the project as immoral and refuses to take part. The remaining agents discuss eliminating the dissenting agent before going to lunch.\nProfessor Jerry Hathaway (Atherton) meets high school student Mitch Taylor (Jarret) at the school's science fair. He informs Mitch that he has been admitted to Pacific Technical University, where he will room with physics \"legend\" Chris Knight (Kilmer). Hathaway is secretly developing the laser for the CIA, but instead of doing the work himself he has his unpaid students do it, while misappropriating the project funding to remodel his house. Arriving on campus, Mitch meets Chris and is disappointed to learn that he is an irreverent slacker who spends his time pulling elaborate high tech pranks (such as covering the dorm floor in ice to go skating). Mitch also meets Jordan (Meyrink), a hyperkinetic female student, \"Ick\" Ikagami, a brilliant and affable foil to Chri's antics, and the mysterious Lazlo Hollyfeld (Jon Gries), a middle-aged man who seems to be living in Mitch's closet. Hathaway's sycophantic graduate assistant Kent (Prescott) becomes hostile when Hathaway puts Mitch in charge of the laser project.\nUnder pressure to get results, Hathaway gives Chris an unrealistic timetable, which Chris dismisses. When Mitch is caught attending Chris' pool party instead of working in the lab, Hathaway berates him. The next day Mitch is mortified when a recording of his tearful phone call to his parents is played over a loudspeaker system during lunch, a prank conceived by Kent and his cronies. Humiliated, Mitch is ready to quit school. Chris convinces him to stay by explaining to him that Lazlo was the top genius at Pacific Tech in the 1970s, but suffered a breakdown when he learned that his theories were being used to build weapons. Chris tells Mitch that if he does not want to \"crack\" like Hollyfeld, he must learn to have fun, and the first order of business is to get even with Kent, calling it a \"moral imperative\" to do so. They accomplish this by disassembling Kent's car and rebuilding it inside his dorm room. Kent vows revenge.\nUnder increasing pressure from the CIA, Hathaway berates Chris for failing to solve the laser power problem and promises to fail him and prevent him from graduating. After a pep-talk from Mitch, Chris devotes himself to solving the power problem and achieving a perfect score on Hathaway's final exam. Mitch is accosted by Sherry Nugel (D'arbanville), a beautiful older woman who seeks amorous encounters with the top ten geniuses in the country (which is revealed earlier when she seduces Chris). Mitch turns her down, realizing he's in love with Jordan, and the two become a couple. Though Chris aces Hathway's exam, Chris and Mitch's efforts appear to be ruined when Kent sabotages the laser. In a fit of anger at the laser's destruction, he has an epiphany that solves the power problem. The beam of the redesigned laser has unlimited range and produces an estimated six megawatts of power, exceeding the original requirement.\nWhile the team celebrates its success, Lazlo insists that the high-energy laser can only be used as a weapon, and in fact that it must have been conceived for this purpose. Chris is devastated. Hathaway has removed the laser from the lab. Chris, Mitch, Ick and Jordan trick Kent into revealing the date when the laser is going to be tested by placing a microphone in his braces and convincing him that God is talking to him. The group tails Hathaway to a nearby Air Force base. While Chris and Mitch talk their way onto the base, Lazlo remotely cracks the laser's computer and changes its target coordinates to Hathaway's house, where the team has placed a huge tin of popcorn. Meanwhile, Chris and Mitch remove some vital circuits that prevent the laser from overheating. When the laser beam hits the house, it is diffused by a prism placed by Chris and the popcorn heats and expands; the house bursts at the seams as popcorn pours out onto the lawn. Kent \"rides\" the flowing popcorn out of the front door unharmed and laughing, thinking the incident was religious in nature. The group, reveling in their success, greet an arriving Lazlo accompanied by Sherry Nugel, riding in a motor home pulling a trailer full of prizes from entering a sweepstakes earlier in the movie. He and Sherry indicate they intend to run off together as he is the genius she's been looking for all this time. The film closes with the group and neighborhood children eating the popcorn to the song \"Everybody Wants to Rule the World\" by the pop group Tears for Fears. Hathaway arrives home and in disbelief, assesses his ruined home.\n<html>\n<head><title>Real Genius Script at IMSDb.<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"Real Genius script at the Internet Movie Script Database.\">\n<meta name=\"keywords\" content=\"Real Genius script, Real Genius movie script, Real Genius film script\">\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" \/>\n<meta name=\"HandheldFriendly\" content=\"true\">\n<meta http-equiv=\"content-type\" content=\"text\/html; charset=iso-8859-1\">\n<meta http-equiv=\"Content-Language\" content=\"EN\">\n\n<meta name=objecttype CONTENT=Document>\n<meta name=ROBOTS CONTENT=\"INDEX, FOLLOW\">\n<meta name=Subject CONTENT=\"Movie scripts, Film scripts\">\n<meta name=rating CONTENT=General>\n<meta name=distribution content=Global>\n<meta name=revisit-after CONTENT=\"2 days\">\n\n<link href=\"\/style.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text\/css\">\n\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-3785444-3']);\n  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n\n  (function() {\n    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text\/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

You want me to start buying weapons from George Lucas?\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">Polite laughter all around.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CARMICHAEL\n<P ID=\"dia\">Now that would be somethin', wouldn't it?\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">DECKER\n<P ID=\"dia\">Well, sometimes I think I might as well.\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(to one of the others)\n<P ID=\"dia\">What do you think of what you saw, Roy?\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ROY\n<P ID=\"dia\">I think there weren't enough girls.\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">More polite laughter. Then Roy turns ice cold in a flash.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ROY (cont'd)\n<P ID=\"dia\">Is this thing for biological targets only?\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CARMICHAEL\n<P ID=\"dia\">No, Sir, this thing would take the skin right off, of Air Force One if you wanted. Not that I'm saying we'd ever want to kill our own President, but, you know, for example.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ROY\n<P ID=\"dia\">Our studies indicate that this type of weapon is totally useless for warfare.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">DECKER\n<P ID=\"dia\">It's not intended for use in your kind of warfare, Roy. This is a perfect peace time weapon.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ROY\n<P ID=\"dia\">What's the kill potential?\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CARMICHAEL\n<P ID=\"dia\">As soon as the size-to power ratio is licked we'll have about seven bangs for the buck.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ROY\n<P ID=\"dia\">When that?\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">Carmichael shrugs the sign for \"who knows?\"\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">DECKER\n<P ID=\"dia\">Seriously, Don, I have to report to the Secretary that everything's on schedule.

EXHIBITION HALL -DAY\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">WE OPEN on a sign: \"Effects of marijuana on Rodents.\" A cage is divided in half. One side is marked \"NO Marijuana.\" A chinchilla is running furiously on a treadmill. The other side is marked \"Marijuana.\" A chinchilla is lying in a little hammock.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">DOLLY BACK TO WIDE SHOT. We see we are in a large hall. There are dozens of booths and exhibits. A banner strung across the hall lets us know that this is the \"WESTERN REGIONAL HIGH SCHOOL WINTER SCIENCE FAIR.\"\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">ANGLE ON a pretty female student at a booth standing in front of a clear glass cylinder that has vacuum hoses connected to it. There are two colored gases inside the cylinder. A sign behind her says: HOW TORNADOS ARE FORMED.\" A small group of boys stand watching her in as sexist a way as possible.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">GIRL\n<P ID=\"dia\">It doesn't seem to be working; but if it was, these gases would be going around.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">A BOY\n<P ID=\"dia\">We don't care.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">ANGLE ON another part of the hall. Two blond-haired, male twins stand proudly in their booth. \"THE GRAVITATIONAL PULL OF HEAVENLY BODIES.\"  A large, crudely painted diorama of the Milky Way is in the background. Several painted balls are suspended in front, labeled \"Mercury,\" \"Venus,\" etc. The sun is represented by a large electromagnet. All the \"planets\"\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">ANGLE ON a booth near the entrance. A ROBOT attracts a crowd. It has a video screen for a face which reads: \"Hi, my name is Harry. Let me guess your weight and age.\"  With jerky motions he extends his mechanical arms and shakes hands with passersby. He is speaking to a small KID.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">HARRY\n<P ID=\"dia\">Hi, my name is Harry. Let me guess your weight and age...midget mutant; weight... \n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">The kid shoots it in the neck with a toy space gun. The ROBOT SHORT CIRCUITS: sparks shoot out, its arms fly in circles until a FUSE BLOWS and it SIZZLES to a burning stop.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">WE PAN OVER TO the door just in time to see the entrance of DR. JERRY ATHERTON, professor of physics at Pacific Tech, and a popular host of a PBS television show about science. His manner and bearing mark him as a classic anal retentive. He is a perfect cross between Carl Sagan and Jerry Brown. Brilliant, intense, seemingly sincere but, in fact, incredibly manipulative. There is an intentional aura of superiority surrounding him.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">We FOLLOW him in and down an aisle where he draws the attention of the crowd in the manner of the celebrity he is. An OLD LADY stops him. He beams a smile at her.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">OLD LADY\n<P ID=\"dia\">Are you Dr. Atherton?\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ATHERTON\n<P ID=\"dia\">Yes, dear.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">OLD LADY\n<P ID=\"dia\">I just love your television show.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ATHERTON\n<P ID=\"dia\">Well, thank you. We try.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">OLD LADY\n<P ID=\"dia\">What's Albert Einstein really like?\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ATHERTON\n<P ID=\"dia\">Dead.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">OLD LADY\n<P ID=\"dia\">Oh, I thought you had him on.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ATHERTON\n<P ID=\"dia\">No, that was just an actor.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">OLD LADY\n<P ID=\"dia\">Is everyone an actor, then?\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ATHERTON\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(beginning to tire of this)\n<P ID=\"dia\">No, I'm a physicist.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">OLD LADY\n<P ID=\"dia\">But Einstein isn't?\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ATHERTON\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(dismissing her)\n<P ID=\"dia\">Nice talking to you.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">He walks away.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">ANGLE ON a booth where we meet MITCH SIMON, aged fifteen. Mitch is a genius. He's known that since he was old enough to understand the word, which was on his first birthday. He was doing college level work by the time he was in the fourth grade. Although he's intellectually precocious, he's still only 15 years old and has all the problems of any average adolescent. His shyness and intellect have always made him feel different and uncomfortable in social situations.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">He stands with his PARENTS near a demonstration table. Unlike some of the other exhibits we've seen, there is nothing amateurish about this one. In fact, it is an impressive display of a dye laser. We can see the beams of multi-colored rays bouncing between mirrors, moving through liquids, combining with gases.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">MITCH is trying to explain his work to MR. SIMON, who is a nice enough guy but who pretty much regards the fact that his son is gifted as a pain in the butt.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MITCH\n<P ID=\"dia\">See, Dad, it's coherent light.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MR. SIMON\n<P ID=\"dia\">It talks?\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MITCH\n<P ID=\"dia\">No. \n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">ATHERTON APPROACHES. He is seen by MRS. SIMON, who greets him.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MRS. SIMON\n<P ID=\"dia\">Dr. ATHERTON, what a surprise.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ATHERTON\n<P ID=\"dia\">Hello, Mrs. Simon. How are you?\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MR. SIMON\n<P ID=\"dia\">No problem with Mitch's test scores or anything, is there?\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ATHERTON\n<P ID=\"dia\">No, no. I just thought I'd stop by, bring you the good news myself. I just got word from the admissions committee. We did it. Mitch is in.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MRS. SIMON\n<P ID=\"dia\">Isn't that wonderful.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ATHERTON\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(to Mitch)\n<P ID=\"dia\">Hello, Mitch.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MITCH\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(shyly)\n<P ID=\"dia\">Hi.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ATHERTON\n<P ID=\"dia\">Nice little display?\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MITCH\n<P ID=\"dia\">Thanks\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ATHERTON\n<P ID=\"dia\">What's your medium?\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MITCH\n<P ID=\"dia\">Just Argon. But I have it all structured for HF if I could get some.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ATHERTON\n<P ID=\"dia\">That would be interesting.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MITCH\n<P ID=\"dia\">It's all theoretical at this stage, but I have the power supply completely worked out.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ATHERTON\n<P ID=\"dia\">Very nice.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MITCH\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(a kid again)\n<P ID=\"dia\">Thanks.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">ATHERTON turns to Mitch's parents.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ATHERTON\n<P ID=\"dia\">You must be very proud. he's the first student we've ever accepted for winter term entrance at Pacific Tech.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MR. SIMON\n<P ID=\"dia\">I image he's the youngest, too.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ATHERTON\n<P ID=\"dia\">No, actually. The youngest we've had was a twelve, but he cracked under the pressure within six months so we don't really count him.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MRS. SIMON\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(almost in tears)\n<P ID=\"dia\">Fifteen year old and off to college. Image.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MR. SIMON\n<P ID=\"dia\">Listen Doc. This scholarship thing, does he get any kind of whatya call it, signing bonus sort of thing?\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ATHERTON\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(hoping this is not going to be a problem)\n<P ID=\"dia\">Well, no...but by allowing Mitch to progress at an accelerated rate we give him the opportunity to fulfill a far greater portion of his remarkable intellectual potential. Don't you agree?\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MR. SIMON\n<P ID=\"dia\">Yeah, I guess. It's just that athletes get, you know, cars and stuff.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ATHERTON\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(polite for Mitch's sake)\n<P ID=\"dia\">Well, I guess we scientists are a little different than athletes.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MR. SIMON\n<P ID=\"dia\">Cheaper.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ATHERTON\n<P ID=\"dia\">Smarter\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MR. SIMON\n<P ID=\"dia\">Not when it comes to getting cars.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MRS. SIMON\n<P ID=\"dia\">We just want the best for Mitchie.\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(changing gears)\n<P ID=\"dia\">Dr. Atherton, I saw your show the other night, about radioactive isotopes, and I have a question for you.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ATHERTON\n<P ID=\"dia\">Oh, yes?\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MRS. SIMON\n<P ID=\"dia\">Is that your real hair?\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MR. SIMON\n<P ID=\"dia\">Well, I wondered that, too.\n\n\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ATHERTON\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(struggling for manners)\n<P ID=\"dia\">Well, interesting question, when you consider the philosophical aspects of whether anything on television is \"real\" or actually just an \"image\" being broadcast.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MR. SIMON\n<P ID=\"dia\">Didn't look real. Anyway, listen, I got to get something to eat or I'm gonna die.\n\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MRS. SIMON\n<P ID=\"dia\">Come on, let's look for something.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">They start away.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MRS. SIMON (cont'd)\n<P ID=\"dia\">I saw over there one of the kids was doing an experiment with insect protein.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MR. SIMON\n<P ID=\"dia\">Did you see anyone doing anything with corned beef?\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">They exit.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ATHERTON\n<P ID=\"dia\">Your parents...\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MITCH\n<P ID=\"dia\">Yes?\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ATHERTON\n<P ID=\"dia\">They're...nice\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MITCH\n<P ID=\"dia\">They're Okay. They just sometimes don't have any idea of what I'm talking about.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ATHERTON\n<P ID=\"dia\">I'm sure of that. Afraid you're going to miss your friends?\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MITCH\n<P ID=\"dia\">No. I don't have any. I think I intimidate other kids.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ATHERTON\n<P ID=\"dia\">Good boy.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MITCH\n<P ID=\"dia\">I don't want to.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ATHERTON\n<P ID=\"dia\">Remember, compared to you, most people have the IQ of a carrot. We're different than most people, Mitch, but you should be proud of that. I mean, look around. From now on, you'll BE amongst peers, colleagues. I suppose I might as well tell you now, I've put you on my personal research team. Some of the finest minds on campus, not the least of which is, of course, my own.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MITCH\n<P ID=\"dia\">It sounds great.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ATHERTON\n<P ID=\"dia\">Well, now, I'm expecting great things from you, my boy. This is only the second time I've given this honor to a freshman. The first was...\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MITCH\n<P ID=\"dia\">Chris Kinsley.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ATHERTON\n<P ID=\"dia\">You know Chris?\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MITCH\n<P ID=\"dia\">No, but he's a legend in the Physics Club.\n\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ATHERTON\n<P ID=\"dia\">Well, you're going to become a legend yourself. You'll be working with Chris. He's a senior now but he's still on the team and still as brilliant as ever.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MITCH\n<P ID=\"dia\">Wow.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"slug\">INT.

Passing through this Disneyland of Science is a well-dressed executive. ROBERT JENSEN, who is guiding Chris on the tour. Chris was heralded as one of the smartest people to ever enter Pacific Tech.  He proved to be even smarter than many of his professors. He also proved to be one of the most outrageous people to ever enter Pacific Tech. his antics are legend. Unimpressed with authority, pomposity and bullshit in general., Chris dresses on the sloppy side of life. Currently he's wearing a sports jacket that's seen better days, over a faded sweatshirt that has the logo \"I ? Toxic Waste.\"\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">They approach a second executive\/scientist, MIKE DODD, who is wearing a lab coat, and a beautiful public relations executive named SHERRY NUGIL, who is also wearing a lab coat but in a whole new way.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">JENSEN\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(as they approach the couple)\n<P ID=\"dia\">Guys, I want you to meet Chris Kinsley.

Nice to meet you Dr. Dodd. Isn't the Telcom raining debris all over Europe?\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">DODD\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(smiling, but angry)\n<P ID=\"dia\">That was a launch problem, not a design problem. Why are you wearing that toy on your head?\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">Chris takes the thing from his head.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHRIS\n<P ID=\"dia\">Oh, this. Sorry, I was worried that people would think I was stuffy, You know, no fun; all brain, no penis,\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">JENSEN\n<P ID=\"dia\">Pardon?\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHRIS\n<P ID=\"dia\">I'm sorry, it's just an infantile response to authority.\n\n\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">JENSEN\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(confused)\n<P ID=\"dia\">Yes. you are Chris Kinsley, aren't you?\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHRIS\n<P ID=\"dia\">No. Well, yes.

PACIFIC TECH CAMPUS-DAY \n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">It is an impressive campus of older California Spanish building mixed with modern architectural marvels. This is the Sunday before the beginning of the Winter Term.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">We pick up MITCH SIMON and FOLLOW him as he crosses campus. He is wearing a tie and jacket, which only adds to his general sense of being out of place. He is carrying a map which he stops to consult every now and again. He stops an upper classman and asks him a question while pointing at the map. The older asks him a question while pointing at the map. The older student takes great delight in turning the map right side up.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"slug\">EXT. PRESIDENT'S HOUSE-AFTERNOON\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">The tasteful and elegant official residence of the university's President. DR. EUGENE MEREDITH. MITCH approaches the open front door, where he is greeted by MRS. MEREDITH.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MITCH\n<P ID=\"dia\">Good afternoon.

THE HOUSE-CONTINOUS\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">They pass through on their way to the backyard.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MITCH\n<P ID=\"dia\">Mitch Simon.\n\n\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MRS. MEREDITH.\n<P ID=\"dia\">Oh yes. You're the special case. I know Gene wants to meet you. You're just in time for his traditional talk. Would you like a glass of sherry?\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MITCH\n<P ID=\"dia\">I'm a minor.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MRS. MEREDITH.\n<P ID=\"dia\">Aha, well of course you are. That would explain your height.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">They exit out onto the patio.\n\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"slug\">EXT. THE PATIO AND GROUNDS OF THE HOUSE-CONTINUOUS\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">The returning freshman class has gathered for a social. Mitch is the only one in a tie. He stands on the patio with Mrs. Meredith whose husband, the apparently ever-jovial professional academic administrator, is about to speak to the assembled.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MEREDITH\n<P ID=\"dia\">People, if I might get your attention.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">The din begins to quiet.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MEREDITH (CONT'D)\n<P ID=\"dia\">Welcome back, freshmen! I take it you all put the Christmas break to good use?\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">There is good-natured jeering.\n\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MEREDITH (CONT'D)\n<P ID=\"dia\">Now, if you'll indulge me, I'd like to speak seriously for a moment. You will recall that when I welcomed you to the Pacific institute of Technology a few short months ago I spoke of how we are one of the finest scientific institutions in the world. I think the finest. I mentioned our six Nobel Prize winners, our members of the national Academy of Sciences, and our members of the National Academy of Engineering.  This is an intellectual oasis of technological achievement in the dessert of general academic mediocrity we see inmost colleges and universities today.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">There is some applause and good-natured banter. Mitch is truly moved. This environment is exactly what Mitch has hoped for all his life.\n\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MEREDITH (CONT'D)\n<P ID=\"dia\">I also spoke of the fact that you are the finest freshmen class we have ever had here.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">There are cheers and applause.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MEREDITH (CONT'D)\n<P ID=\"dia\">I say this to every freshman class. Each year we raise our entrance requirements and each year there is a group of students like you who meet and surpass those requirements.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">Almost jubilant cheering and clapping.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MEREDITH (CONT'D)\n<P ID=\"dia\">As you have no doubt already noticed by now, over a third of you are gone. By the end of the year another third of you will have followed them out of Eden and into mediocrity.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">The crowd goes deathly silent as Meredith continues in his cherry manner.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MEREDITH (CONT'D)\n<P ID=\"dia\">We want only the best. Hard work and high standards are expected of everyone. And if you aren't up to it Cal tech or M.I.T. might take you, but you don't fit in here.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MEREDITH (CONT'D)\n<P ID=\"dia\">Let me remind you that this place is an opportunity, not a right; a chance not a gift; a working lunch, not a picnic. Welcome back.\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">Several waitresses begin serving tea but the despair of reality creeps over the students and they begin to disperse. Mitch stands waiting for the approaching Dr. Meredith.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MRS. MEREDITH \n<P ID=\"dia\">Gene, this is Mitch Simon.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MEREDITH\n<P ID=\"dia\">Oh, yes, Professor Artherton's bright star.\n\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MITCH\n<P ID=\"dia\">Yes, sir.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MEREDITH\n<P ID=\"dia\">And I understand you're already on his project. I'm assured you're going to do great things.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MITCH\n<P ID=\"dia\">I hope so.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MEREDITH\n<P ID=\"dia\">Let me give you some advice.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MITCH\n<P ID=\"dia\">Thank you.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MEREDITH\n<P ID=\"dia\">Don't screw up.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MITCH\n<P ID=\"dia\">Okay. I guess I better go now.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">He walks away.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MEREDITH\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(watching Mitch with satisfaction)\n<P ID=\"dia\">I think the young people really appreciate my \" getting down\" verbally, don't you?\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MRS. MEREDITH \n<P ID=\"dia\">Absolutely.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"slug\">EXT. CAMPUS-LATER\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">Once again Mitch, map in hand, must ask another student for directions. This one also turns the map right-side up and then points to the building they are standing in front of. As he heads for it he passes a bronze bust of one of the founding fathers, DR. BRADFORD. The students have decorated him with a muffler, earmuffs and carrot nose to look like a snowman.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"slug\">INT. APPLIED PHYSICS BUILDING-MOMENTS LATER\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">Mitch walks down a long corridor. He passes several open doors that reveal laboratories with all kinds of scientific equipment all over them.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">Mitch stops in front of a closed door. He checks the number, then looks down at a card in his hand. He turns the card right-side up. He OPENS the door to REVEAL a darkened lab. In the darkness there is a veritable light show of laser beams. A voice calls out from the darkness.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">VOICE (O.C.)\n<P ID=\"dia\">Hey!\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MITCH\n<P ID=\"dia\">Yes?\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">VOICE (O.C.)\n<P ID=\"dia\">Come in here.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"slug\">INT. LAB-CONTINUOUS\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">Mitch ENTERS quickly and shuts the door behind himself.  In the instrument glow we can make out the forms of three other students. They are: KENT, CARTER and BODIE, members of Dr. Atherton's research team.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">KENT\n<P ID=\"dia\">Just leave the sandwiches and go.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MITCH\n<P ID=\"dia\">Me?\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">KENT\n<P ID=\"dia\">No, Yoda; yeah, you.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MITCH\n<P ID=\"dia\">I don't have any ah...\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CARTER\n<P ID=\"dia\">Brains?\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MITCH\n<P ID=\"dia\">No, sandwiches.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">KENT\n<P ID=\"dia\">Well then, what good are you?\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CARTER\n<P ID=\"dia\">What are we supposed to eat?\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MITCH\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(getting a little fed up)\n<P ID=\"dia\">How about my shorts.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">KENT\n<P ID=\"dia\">Hey! Who do you think you're talking to?\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">The laser snaps off and the lights snap on. The glare is a little intense at first.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">KENT (CONT'D)\n<P ID=\"dia\">Are you from the restaurant or not?\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">With the lights on we get a chance to have a better look at the team. Kent is an elitist, intellectual snob with very little imagination who likes to think of himself as Atherton's prot\u00e9g\u00e9. He wears braces on his teeth because he knows how important a proper smile can be in the marketplace.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MITCH\n<P ID=\"dia\">No. I'm Mitch Simon. I'm a student. Dr. Atherton told me to come up here.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">KENT\n<P ID=\"dia\">Oh, you're the new stud, are you. Or is it dud?\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MITCH\n<P ID=\"dia\">How do you mean?\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BODIE\n<P ID=\"dia\">Stud. Hot shot. Brain. You're the twelve-year-old, right?\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MITCH\n<P ID=\"dia\">I'm fifteen.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CARTER\n<P ID=\"dia\">Does your body know that?\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">Mitch attempts a good-natured laugh. It's not a great attempt.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MITCH\n<P ID=\"dia\">Are you expecting him or...\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">KENT\n<P ID=\"dia\">Sure. Can I get you something? A balloon?\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MITCH\n<P ID=\"dia\">Are any of you guys Chris Kinsley?\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">They all freeze.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">KENT\n<P ID=\"dia\">No, Thank God.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CARTER\n<P ID=\"dia\">Hey Kent, I hear Kinsley got that PEI job all locked up.\n\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">KENT\n<P ID=\"dia\">Damn! I wanted that job.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MITCH\n<P ID=\"dia\">Why?\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">KENT\n<P ID=\"dia\">Why? Because it starts at fifty thousand a year, that's why. Plus travel, car, stock options...\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MITCH\n<P ID=\"dia\">Oh. Well, I'm supposed to have a look at your work up to date. Check it over.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">KENT\n<P ID=\"dia\">Check it over.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MITCH\n<P ID=\"dia\">Yes.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">KENT\n<P ID=\"dia\">For what?\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MITCH\n<P ID=\"dia\">Mistakes, I guess. He said you guys are stuck.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">The room goes rigid. Evidently this little punk of an upstart needs to be told what Christ died for.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">KENT\n<P ID=\"dia\">Let's get something very clear here. Everything you've heard about the supportive student body and the honor code might hold for the rest of the campus, but it doesn't count for squat in here. Which means when jerry's not here, you do what I say. From God to Jerry to me, get it?\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">Atherton ENTERS.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">KENT (CONT'D)\n<P ID=\"dia\">Hi Jerry.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ATHERTON\n<P ID=\"dia\">I've told you before, Kent, you don't get to use my first name.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">KENT\n<P ID=\"dia\">Did I?\n\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ATHERTON\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(to Mitch)\n<P ID=\"dia\">Good to see you, Mitch.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ATHERTON (CONT'D)\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(to the group)\n<P ID=\"dia\">I'm sure you're all going to become fast friends.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">KENT\n<P ID=\"dia\">We're well on our way already.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ATHERTON\n<P ID=\"dia\">Good, because after Mitch is brought up to date, I want the rest of you to take your cues from him. He'll be in charge of the group.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">KENT\n<P ID=\"dia\">What? I mean, good choice, Jerry.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ATHERTON\n<P ID=\"dia\">You're doing it again, Kent.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">KENT\n<P ID=\"dia\">Am I?\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ATHERTON\n<P ID=\"dia\">Where's Chris?\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">KENT\n<P ID=\"dia\">He didn't bother to come in today.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BODIE\n<P ID=\"dia\">He said he didn't feel like it; and then I said 'you better'; and then he said ' or what?'; and then I said ' or he'd get the heck,' and then he said 'jam it, it's Sunday' and he looks for God on Sundays; so I said 'okay, but I'm telling.'\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ATHERTON\n<P ID=\"dia\">Thank you Bodie. I notice you've stopped stuttering.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BODIE\n<P ID=\"dia\">Yes, I've been giving myself some sock treatment and it's working.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ATHERTON\n<P ID=\"dia\">Good.\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(to Mitch)\n<P ID=\"dia\">I'm sorry he isn't here. I wanted you to meet your hero.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CARTER\n<P ID=\"dia\">Hero? That clown? Look at this.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">He points to a table full of laser equipment comprised of various angled mirrors and gas cambers and drib units. The others gather around it.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CARTER (Cont'd)\n<P ID=\"dia\">We heard he wasn't coming in. Kent and I figured we'd go ahead and run his section without him. And we started getting picosecond ratings that aren't even in the ballpark.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">KENT\n<P ID=\"dia\">It looks like it'll take at least a week to re-do all this and start again.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">Mitch is carefully studying the equipment and checking some notes that were on the table.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">KENT (CONT'D)\n<P ID=\"dia\">Another costly mistake.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ATHERTON\n<P ID=\"dia\">Are you sure?\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CARTER\n<P ID=\"dia\">Positive.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">KENT\n<P ID=\"dia\">Positive.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MITCH\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(reading from notes)\n<P ID=\"dia\">Negative.\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(innocently, to Carter and Kent)\n<P ID=\"dia\">There's a mistake all right, but I think you guys made it. Look, you inverted the last two steps.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CARTER\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(grabbing the notes)\n<P ID=\"dia\">I don't make mistakes...\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(reading)\n<P ID=\"dia\">...Usually.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ATHERTON\n<P ID=\"dia\">Damnit, don't touch other people's things.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MITCH\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(adjusting the equipment)\n<P ID=\"dia\">This shouldn't take too long to fix.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ATHERTON\n<P ID=\"dia\">I'm glad that you were here, Mitch.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">KENT\n<P ID=\"dia\">Yes, thanks for pointing out Carter's mistake, Mitch.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ATHERTON\n<P ID=\"dia\">Don't bother with that now. I'm sure you want to go get settled.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MITCH\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(relieved)\n<P ID=\"dia\">Well, it has been kind of a long day.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">Atherton starts to leave.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ATHERTON\n<P ID=\"dia\">Oh, I forgot Kent, I need your help.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">KENT\n<P ID=\"dia\">Anything, Jerry.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ATHERTON\n<P ID=\"dia\">Stop it.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">KENT\n<P ID=\"dia\">What?\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ATHERTON\n<P ID=\"dia\">Get copies made of everything so young Mitch here can get started  checking everything tomorrow.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">KENT\n<P ID=\"dia\">My pleasure.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ATHERTON\n<P ID=\"dia\">And then, on your way back, stop at my cleaners.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">KENT\n<P ID=\"dia\">Don't give it a thought. I enjoy it.\n\n\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ATHERTON\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(to Mitch)\n<P ID=\"dia\">Shall we?\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MITCH\n<P ID=\"dia\">Sure.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">Atherton exits, followed by Mitch.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">BODIE\n<P ID=\"dia\">I guess it goes from God to Jerry to you to the cleaners, right Kent?\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"slug\">EXT. DORM HALL- LATE AFTERNOON\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">Mitch enters the arched column portico of this dormitory building.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"slug\">INT. ROOM\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">The room is small, cramped, and more than a little disheveled. PEI, NASA and science fiction posters hang on the ceiling and wall, over and around one of the two beds. Junk food and soft drink containers are littered everywhere. In one corner is a fully-stocked Frito Lay Chip display.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">Mitch crosses to his bed and sits. He is exhausted and depressed. The door opens and Mitch see a strange, tall, bulkily- built, hermit-looking kind of a guy enter. He is carrying a McDonald's bag. He stops when he see Mitch and stares at him in a quirky way for a second, then crosses to the closet, opens the door and exits into it.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MITCH\n<P ID=\"dia\">Hello?\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">Getting no response, Mitch rises, goes to the closet, opens it and looks in.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MITCH\n<P ID=\"dia\">Hello?\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">There is no one there.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MITCH\n<P ID=\"dia\">What kind of place is this?\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">Mitch crosses to his luggage. he opens a bag and, to his surprise, he finds it empty. he then looks in the other bag and find they've all been cleaned out. Puzzled, he shuts the bags.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">Suddenly, the door swings open and CHRIS KINSLEY , who we saw earlier at PEI, ENTERS. He's dragging a large piece of mechanical equipment. it is, in fact, a baseball pitching machine.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHRIS\n<P ID=\"dia\">Hi.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">Mitch stares.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHRIS (CONT'D)\n<P ID=\"dia\">Hey, you just gonna sit there admiring the room or are you going to help me with this?\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MITCH\n<P ID=\"dia\">What is this thing?\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHRIS\n<P ID=\"dia\">It's a penis stretcher. You want to try it out?\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MITCH\n<P ID=\"dia\">No!\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHRIS\n<P ID=\"dia\">Oh really? Well, congratulations, then, No, It's an Iron Mike.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MITCH\n<P ID=\"dia\">What?\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHRIS\n<P ID=\"dia\">A baseball pitching machine.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">Chris is setting it up.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MITCH\n<P ID=\"dia\">I was here for a second this morning...\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHRIS\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(frightened)\n<P ID=\"dia\">You didn't straighten the place up, did you?\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MITCH\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(looks around at the mess)\n<P ID=\"dia\">No.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHRIS\n<P ID=\"dia\">Good. 'Cause all my filth's in alphabetical order.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">Chris puts on a baseball cap and grabs a bat.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MITCH\n<P ID=\"dia\">Anyway, I dropped off my luggage and now all my bags are empty.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">A ball is pitched. Chris connects and the ball smashes through the window.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHRIS\n<P ID=\"dia\">I put your stuff away for you.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">Another pitch. He smashes a ball into a wall.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHRIS (CONT'D)\n<P ID=\"dia\">It's all in the bottom drawer. Shirts, pants, underwear, shoes. I had a little trouble with your sport jacket, so I threw it out. Nah, only kidding. This one's for you, little Johnny.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">He whacks another pitch. He does a crowd cheer and circles the bases.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHRIS\n<P ID=\"dia\">What a game.

MOVING CAR- SAME TIME\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">Dr. Atherton is riding in a rental car with DON CARMICHAEL, a government contract monitor. These two guys are part of an old boy network involved with research and development.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CARMICHAEL\n<P ID=\"dia\">We're falling way behind, Jer.\n\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ATHERTON\n<P ID=\"dia\">Well, we're not making cheese sandwiches here, you know, Don.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CARMICHAEL\n<P ID=\"dia\">That's a good one. I'll have to remember to use that, Jer.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ATHERTON\n<P ID=\"dia\">The new boy is quick.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CARMICHAEL\n<P ID=\"dia\">He better be because the company needs a practical working model within four months.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ATHERTON\n<P ID=\"dia\">You can't dictate innovation.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CARMICHAEL\n<P ID=\"dia\">Let me put this another way, Jer. You  know all that money we've been spending for development?\n\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ATHERTON\n<P ID=\"dia\">Yes\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CARMICHAEL\n<P ID=\"dia\">Well, when a project gets cut off, the finance boys always run an audit.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ATHERTON\n<P ID=\"dia\">I see.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">The car pulls up to Atherton's house, where there is a great deal of construction going on. Once the work is completed, this is going to be beautifully restored, rather large Victorian home.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CARMICHAEL\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(looking out)\n<P ID=\"dia\">Having a little work done on the old place, are you?

He looks at a chart on the wall.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MITCH\n<P ID=\"dia\">Library... library...205.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">The door to the room opens while Mitch is looking the other way. We catch a glimpse of the same tall, bulkily-built man opening Mitch's closet door and disappearing inside. Mitch turns just in time to see the door close. he goes into it, opens it and looks inside. Nothing. he goes to the door of his room. Mitch opens the door, steps into the hall and slips, landing on his ass. His books go flying.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"slug\">INT. HALLWAY\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">The hall floor is covered with ice wall-to-wall. Skating MUSIC is playing on a cassette somewhere. A few students, dressed for winter, are skating. Chris skates over and helps Mitch to his feet.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHRIS\n<P ID=\"dia\">Welcome to Pacific Tech's \"Smart People On Ice.\"\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">He whirls away, leaping from wall to wall, sliding quickly down the ice. He stops in front of a short, roly-poly kid of Japanese descent, MARK ICKAGAMI, better know as ICK. Ick is a bio-chemist who spends a great deal of time in his lab experimenting with various fun compounds that do things ranging from making artificial ice to increasing memory.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHRIS\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(with a proletariat accent)\n<P ID=\"dia\">Ice turned out real good, Ick.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ICK \n<P ID=\"dia\">Yeah, it worked., didn't it?\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHRIS\n<P ID=\"dia\">What did you use?\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ICK \n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(teasing)\n<P ID=\"dia\">Oh, sure, I tell you then you tell somebody else, and the next thing you know we're in the middle of another ice age.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHRIS\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(yelling down the hall)\n<P ID=\"dia\">Come on, people. Nobody's skating.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">A STUDENT (O.C.)\n<P ID=\"dia\">Just 'cause you're a slack, Kinsley.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHRIS\n<P ID=\"dia\">Moles and trolls.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MITCH\n<P ID=\"dia\">What?\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHRIS\n<P ID=\"dia\">Moles and trolls. Work, work, work, work. I plan this for weeks. I go to a lot of trouble and all they want to do is study. I'm hurt. I know that's it's not like me but I'm sorry. I'm starting to get discouraged, people. We had nobody at the mutant hamster races, one entry in the Madame Curie look-alike contest, and he was disqualified later. Why do I even bother?\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">Chris skates off.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MITCH\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(to Ick)\n<P ID=\"dia\">How does he do it?\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ICK \n<P ID=\"dia\">Well, I'm not an expert, but I think he puts one foot in front of the other and pushes.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MITCH\n<P ID=\"dia\">Not skating. The horsing around. The never studying. I know he's smart. but nobody's that smart.\n\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ICK \n<P ID=\"dia\">I don't know how smart he is. Before he even came here he invented a solar battery, which laid the groundwork for the system that provides the energy for Amarillo, at half the cost. He'd be a millionaire today if he been smart enough to make them pay for it. How he pulls the grades, I don't know.\n\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">Just then, ROARING down the hall, face down on a sled, comes JORDANS COCHRAN. She is an advanced engineering student with great theoretical and mechanical skill who can never seem to pitched energy of a hyper-kinetic kindergarten class. She crashes at Mitch's feet. He reaches down to help her.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MITCH\n<P ID=\"dia\">You okay?\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">JORDAN\n<P ID=\"dia\">No, not emotionally, no I'm not. I'm disappointed... not terribly, but still, it should have gone much, further, much faster. It's okay, though, I know what the problem is, that's simple, it's obviously the drag coefficient, I'll just have to re-design the blades. I can do that, that's easy. I can do that here; but I have to cut then after they're designed, that takes tools, that takes time. How long is this stuff going to last, do you know?\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ICK \n<P ID=\"dia\">Maybe another half an hour.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">JORDAN\n<P ID=\"dia\">That's great, that's good. I can do that, no problem, lots of time.\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(to Mitch)\n<P ID=\"dia\">What's your name?\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MITCH\n<P ID=\"dia\">Mitch\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">JORDAN\n<P ID=\"dia\">Thanks for the help. See you.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">And in a flash she is gone.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MITCH\n<P ID=\"dia\">Your welcome.\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(to Ick)\n<P ID=\"dia\">Who was that?\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ICK \n<P ID=\"dia\">That? that was...\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">Jordan rushes back.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">JORDAN\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(to Mitch)\n<P ID=\"dia\">I'm Jordan, I realized I'd forgotten to tell you my name, it's Jordan. I heard there was going to be someone new this term, are you a freshman?\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MITCH\n<P ID=\"dia\">Yes.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">JORDAN\n<P ID=\"dia\">Do you have a bed?\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MITCH\n<P ID=\"dia\">Yeah.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">JORDAN\n<P ID=\"dia\">Oh, I was going to make you one if you needed it but you don't so that's okay. Well, I gotta go, I'll see you later, probably. See you Ick, see you Mitch.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">As she races off, KENT enters carrying several binders.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">KENT\n<P ID=\"dia\">What's all this suppose to be?\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHRIS\n<P ID=\"dia\">This? This is new kind of shovel.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">Mitch finds this very funny and reacts accordingly by laughing.\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">Kent can't stand to be laughed at.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">KENT\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(Dumping the binders into Mitch's hands)\n<P ID=\"dia\">This should keep you busy for awhile. This, plus your regular class load should turn your brains to mush in a month.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MITCH\n<P ID=\"dia\">Aw! Kent, we were going to name you King of the Winter Carnival.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">KENT\n<P ID=\"dia\">Ha ha.\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(to Ick)\n<P ID=\"dia\">I suppose you're in on this, too. Did you make this stuff?\n\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ICK \n<P ID=\"dia\">I'm not saying.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">KENT\n<P ID=\"dia\">Who's going to clean it up?\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ICK \n<P ID=\"dia\">Don't have to. It's going to go from solid form directly to gas.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">KENT\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(impressed by this fairly uncommon phenomenon)\n<P ID=\"dia\">Really? What is it?\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ICK \n<P ID=\"dia\">I'm not saying. But I can tell you that it's fairly rare, and very unstable.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">KENT\n<P ID=\"dia\">You're all a bunch of degenerates.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHRIS\n<P ID=\"dia\">We are? What about that time I caught you naked with a bowl of Jello?\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">KENT\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(flustered)\n<P ID=\"dia\">I...you... I was hot and I was hungry. And anyway...Look, Kinsley, you're not number one anymore.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHRIS\n<P ID=\"dia\">Number one what?\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">KENT\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(pointing to Mitch)\n<P ID=\"dia\">Mighty mouse, here, beat your placement scores by over twenty points.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHRIS\n<P ID=\"dia\">Really? I guess you think you're pretty hot stuff?\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MITCH\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(uncomfortable, unsure if this is real)\n<P ID=\"dia\">Well...no, I mean\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHRIS\n<P ID=\"dia\">Hey! Maybe you are smarter than me, but, can you do this?\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">Chris pushes himself off backwards and slides along the ice in an attempt at a fancy figure skating move. Just as he's about to finish he crashes to the floor at the precise moment that the floor turns into a cloud of rising gas. Chris disappears in the cloud.\n\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ICK \n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(excited)\n<P ID=\"dia\">It worked!\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MITCH\n<P ID=\"dia\">That's neat.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ICK \n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(teasing)\n<P ID=\"dia\">Now if we can just keep it from exploding.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">Kent runs away.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHRIS\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(from inside the growing cloud)\n<P ID=\"dia\">Hey, Ick.  Is it okay to breathe this stuff?\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(beat)\n<P ID=\"dia\">Ick?\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(beat)\n<P ID=\"dia\">Ick?\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">The cloud fills the screen.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"slug\">INT. CHRIS AND MITCH'S ROOM-THE NEXT MORNING\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">Perfect morning light streams through the window, making even this dump look beautiful. Chris is asleep in a strange position on his bed, proving that even asleep he is eccentric. We Pan across the room to Mitch. He has obviously fallen asleep while reading the binders that Kent had given him the night before. We HEAR the sound of the door opening, followed by some heavy footsteps. This causes Mitch to wake up. it takes him a second to realize where he is. He sits up.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">MITCH'S POV\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">Again we catch just a glimpse of that same mysterious figure opening the closet door. He is holding a \"McDonald's\" bag. He closes the door behind him.\n\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">ANGLE ON MITCH\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">To say the least, he's thrown by this strange intrusion.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MITCH\n<P ID=\"dia\">Hello?\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">He waits a beat, listening. Nothing happens so he gets up and crosses to the closet, looks inside.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">OVER MITCH'S SHOULDER INTO CLOSET\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">There's nothing in there but clothes. Mitch pushes the garments aside and finds just a wall.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">ANGLE ON MITCH\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">He shakes his head. This is getting frustrating. He exits the room.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"slug\">INT. BATHROOM\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">Mitch crosses to the urinal. Just as he is about to relieve himself, the door opens. Jordan enters. This is an experience Mitch has never before and as a result he is one uncomfortable fifteen-year-old.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">JORDAN\n<P ID=\"dia\">Hi, good morning, I thought I saw you come in here, you must be an earlier riser, we met last night, I'm Jordan, remember? I had a sled with me, I made you a sweater.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">She holds out a sweater. He leans into the urinal, trying to hide himself the best he can.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MITCH\n<P ID=\"dia\">Last night?\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">JORDAN\n<P ID=\"dia\">yeah, it's just something I do with my hands while I'm reading. I hope I got the size right, I'm pretty sure I did, I have a brother so I use him as a sizing comparison, and I have a pretty good eye for that sort of thing, so I just went ahead and made you one because I was, you know, up. Peeing?\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MITCH\n<P ID=\"dia\">Yeah.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">JORDAN\n<P ID=\"dia\">I never sleep. I don't know why. It drove my roommate nuts. I mean really nuts, they had to take her away in an ambulance and everything, she's okay now thought but she had to be transfer to an easier school but I don't know if that part has anything to do with being my fault, but still, anyway, if you ever want any help studying at night or just let me know, okay, 'cause I'm just a couple of doors down from you guys and I'm usually up and I wouldn't mind, okay?\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MITCH\n<P ID=\"dia\">Thanks, I will.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">JORDAN\n<P ID=\"dia\">Are you finished yet?\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MITCH\n<P ID=\"dia\">I can't start.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">JORDAN\n<P ID=\"dia\">Because I'm here?\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MITCH\n<P ID=\"dia\">I think so.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">JORDAN\n<P ID=\"dia\">Isn't that weird? Well, I have to go.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MITCH\n<P ID=\"dia\">Me, too.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">JORDAN\n<P ID=\"dia\">Right, well, don't forget what I said, I'll put the sweater in your room, see you later, tell Chris that if he wants one I'll be happy to make him one but nit today because after classes I'm going to rebuild the back part of my room, you should come down and see it later, I have to go, bye.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">She exits.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MITCH\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(stunned)\n<P ID=\"dia\">bye.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"slug\">INT. THE LOBBY AREA OF THE DORM- A LITTLE LATER\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">Mitch is coming down a hallway into the area. He is dressed in his tie and jacket and has books under his arm. As he crosses past the self-serve vending machine he spots Chris entering the kitchen. Mitch follows him inside.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MITCH\n<P ID=\"dia\">Something strange happened to me this morning.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHRIS\n<P ID=\"dia\">Was it a dream where you see yourself dressed up in kind of sun god robes standing on top of a pyramid with all theses nude women throwing little pickles at you?\n\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MITCH\n<P ID=\"dia\">No\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHRIS\n<P ID=\"dia\">Why am I the only person who has that dream?\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">Before Mitch can ask another question, Chris open the freezer compartment and takes out a large thermos-like container. He takes it over to the cutting board, then takes from his pocket a pair of calipers, a pair of tweezers, and a little box that looks like a dental floss kit. He opens the container which immediately starts pouring thick steam.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MITCH\n<P ID=\"dia\">Liquid nitrogen?\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">Chris uses calipers to extract a length of tubing from inside the container. he puts it down on the board and, using the tweezers, pushing out a cylindrical mound of ice from inside the tube. Then, from the dental floss kit, he pulls out a length of very fine wire, which he uses to cut the ice into a number of thin \"coins\" and slides then into the lid of the container, which he picks up and takes out the door with him. Mitch follows.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"slug\">INT. VENDING MACHINE AREA\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHRIS\n<P ID=\"dia\">Coffee?\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">Using the tweezers, Chris picks up an ice coin and puts it into one of the machines. There is a high-pitched squeak. To Mitch's astonishment, the machine accepts the bogus money and a cup drops down and fills with coffee.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHRIS\n<P ID=\"dia\">So, what's happened?\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MITCH\n<P ID=\"dia\">Oh. There's a guy living in our closet.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHRIS\n<P ID=\"dia\">You've seen him too?\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">Chris puts his coins in several of the machines and retrieves from them junk food junky's treasure trove of goodies.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MITCH\n<P ID=\"dia\">Who is it?\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHRIS\n<P ID=\"dia\">Hopsfield.\n\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MITCH\n<P ID=\"dia\">Is he... safe?\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHRIS\n<P ID=\"dia\">So far.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">Chris exits. Mitch stares after him.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">SCHOOL MONTAGE:\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">A quick series of shots moves us through the next two months of time, accompanied by an original song.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"slug\">INT. LECTURE HALL-DAY\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">An older professor is lecturing, pointing to a complicated algebraic problem on a blackboard, Mitch is in the last row of this student-filled, multi-tiered classroom. Everyone else listens intently and makes notes while Mitch thumbs quickly through a textbook, then closes it and makes a note in a loose-leaf binder.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"slug\">INT.

CHRIS AND MITCH'S ROOM-NIGHT\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">it is late but Mitch is still hard at the books. Hopsfield goes by and disappears in the closet. Mitch doesn't even notice anymore. There is a knock at the door and Jordan enters. She has brought Mitch a device that she just built which holds textbooks and turns the pages automatically.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"slug\">INT. LECTURE HALL-DAY\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">Mitch, dressed more informally, is in the same room with the same professor as in scene 54. This time, however, there are several empty seats.

LIBRARY-MORNING\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">Mitch comes down the stairs with several books under his arms. He stumbles and drops one of the books.

CHRIS AND MITCH'S ROOM-ANOTHER NIGHT\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">In need of a break from studying, Mitch goes to the closet in hopes of figuring out how to open the wall.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">He examines the walls and the floor and looks, for hidden switches or secret mechanisms, all to no avail. As he's about to give up, the closet door swings closed. When it closes, the wall opens to reveal a small elevator-like cage. Mitch steps in and the cage descends. It hits a lever and stops. But before Mitch steps in and the can get off, it begins to move sideways, triggering another pulley, and goes down again into the steam tunnels, then drags along the floor and stops. Mitch gets out. It's spooky. In the distance there is a glow of light.\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">Mitch goes forward until he can see the home of Hopsfield. It's a very utilitarian example of life on the edge, with all the comforts. At the console of an amazing, hand-built computer sits amazing Hopsfield. Mitch watches in awe from the darkness.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"slug\">INT. ATHERTON'S LAB-DAY\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">There is an experiment in progress. A large laser is building up an energy load. Atherton, Kent, Bodie, Carter, and Mitch monitor various pieces of equipment. Things hum and click and there is a sense that something big is going to happen. Atherton seems pleased, while Mitch seems troubled. Suddenly, a valve blows and a stream of liquid nitrogen hisses from a hose, spewing frost over everything. Everyone jumps for switches and they shut the experiment down.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CARTER\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(checking the valve)\n<P ID=\"dia\">It's nothing.

ATHERTON'S HOUSE-EARLY EVENING\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">The restoration work is reaching completion and the house is looking pretty beautiful. \n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">A small crew of workmen paint and do other finishing work. Chris is sitting on the porch, watching. He is eating a very large puffs of popcorn from a bag. We SEE Atherton returning from his daily jog. He is decked out in an expensive designer jogging suit and has all the appropriate accessories. he also has all the silly habits of the trendy runner for cooling down and stretching.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHRIS\n<P ID=\"dia\">You wanted to see me, your joggingness?\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ATHERTON\n<P ID=\"dia\">Mr. Kinsley. Right on time. What a surprise. Do you run?\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHRIS\n<P ID=\"dia\">Only when chased.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ATHERTON\n<P ID=\"dia\">What are you eating?\n\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHRIS\n<P ID=\"dia\">It's one of mark's Ickagami's experiments. He's been irradiating corn with strontium. it's his hobby; big food.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ATHERTON\n<P ID=\"dia\">That's popcorn?\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHRIS\n<P ID=\"dia\">It's big popcorn.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ATHERTON\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(over reacting)\n<P ID=\"dia\">Get it away from me. I can't stand it. I hate popcorn. Leave it there.\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">Chris puts the bag down on the porch.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHRIS\n<P ID=\"dia\">Okay. Have you ever considered switching to de-caffeinated coffee?\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">Atherton leads Chris to the front door, where he removes his shoes and then stands and waits until Chris does the same. They proceed into the house.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"slug\">INT. ATHERTON'S HOUSE- CONTINUOUS\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">The interior is immaculate. A classic example of elegant good taste. Atherton is fastidiously protective of his things.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ATHERTON\n<P ID=\"dia\">I want to start seeing a lot more of you in the lab.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHRIS\n<P ID=\"dia\">You want me to work nude?\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ATHERTON\n<P ID=\"dia\">Very funny, you're a major disappointment to me, Chris.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHRIS\n<P ID=\"dia\">And you to me, Jerry.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ATHERTON\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(angry)\n<P ID=\"dia\">We had a deal!\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHRIS\n<P ID=\"dia\">And I advanced your project more than any three guys on campus.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ATHERTON\n<P ID=\"dia\">That was yesterday. What have you done for me today?\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHRIS\n<P ID=\"dia\">Hey, aren't you getting a little obsessive about this? I took in the new kid. He's working his guts out for you.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ATHERTON\n<P ID=\"dia\">Your arrogant, disrespectful behavior is distracting him. If you keep it up, you're going to pay for it.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHRIS\n<P ID=\"dia\">Hey, I'm out of here. Delenda Est Cartheo. P.E.I. July one.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ATHERTON\n<P ID=\"dia\">You still have to pass, dear boy, and considering the fact that my class is a requisite, it would seem that I would have some control over your destiny. From now on, you and Mr. Simon are going to spend every waking moment working on my power problem and you will solve it by my deadline.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHRIS\n<P ID=\"dia\">Okay, Jerry, but I really think you should see an analyst.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">Chris exits. Atherton watches him go.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"slug\">INT. ATHERTON'S LAB-NIGHT\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">Mitch is alone and trying to work on the new, smaller laser. He looks tired and upset. He tinkers around for a while, then goes back to his table and looks at his notes. Nothing seems to make sense anymore. Chris enters with a beaker in his hand.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHRIS\n<P ID=\"dia\">Hi. Do me a favor, taste this.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">Mitch is confused.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHRIS (CONT'D)\n<P ID=\"dia\">Come on, you won't hurt my feelings.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MITCH\n<P ID=\"dia\">I...\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">Chris rams the spoon in his mouth.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHRIS\n<P ID=\"dia\">Well, too sweet?\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">Mitch makes a face.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MITCH\n<P ID=\"dia\">What is it?\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHRIS\n<P ID=\"dia\">Beats me. I just found it in one of the labs.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MITCH\n<P ID=\"dia\">Aggghh!!\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHRIS\n<P ID=\"dia\">Come on. I'm just pulling your leg. How are you doing?\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MITCH\n<P ID=\"dia\">I'm stuck. Dr. Atherton says we've got to miniaturize the power supply and you're not helping.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHRIS\n<P ID=\"dia\">Lighten up. It's only a laser.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">Chris goes to the laser. Mitch is annoyed.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHRIS (CONT'D)\n<P ID=\"dia\">Instead of trying to take that roomful of capacitors over there and putting new perspective. Charge this baby up. Everything you've got.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MITCH\n<P ID=\"dia\">What for?\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHRIS\n<P ID=\"dia\">You'll see. Go\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">Mitch goes next door. Chris, meanwhile, measures a certain distant from the floor and mounts a mirror on the wall above his head. He then moves to the laser and repositions it to shoot at the mirror. Mitch returns and makes some adjustments to a control panel.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MITCH\n<P ID=\"dia\">All set, I think.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHRIS\n<P ID=\"dia\">Do it.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">Mitch throws a switch. Immediately, a loud electrical hum fills the air. Chris goes over and opens the door to the hall and glances left.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">CHRIS'S POV\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">A roomful of capacitors loading.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"slug\">EXT. THE CAMPUS-NIGHT\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">The lights twinkle from various buildings. WE HEAR the hum\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"slug\">EXT. THE CAMPUS-NIGHT\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">The lights twinkle from various buildings. We hear the hum growing.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MITCH (V.O.)\n<P ID=\"dia\">What are you doing now?\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHRIS (V.O.)\n<P ID=\"dia\">Making hamburgers.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">Suddenly, there are several loud snaps and all the lights on campus go off at once as the power overload blows the sub station fuses.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MITCH (V.O.)\n<P ID=\"dia\">Oh, no!\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"slug\">INT. THE LAB IN DARKNESS\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHRIS\n<P ID=\"dia\">Relax, it's just the fuses at the sub station. They'll have it back on in a second. More importantly, did we get a charge?\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">Suddenly there is a loud \"crack\" and the laser sends out a beam across the room, bouncing off the mirror on the wall., out the door, where it hits another mirror and disappears from sight.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MITCH\n<P ID=\"dia\">Wow!\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"slug\">EXT. THE CAMPUS-CONTINUOUS\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">The beam has formed a web of light across the darkened campus. The effect is quite spectacular. People look in awe. Chris and Mitch exit the physics building.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHRIS\n<P ID=\"dia\">Follow the yellow brick road.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MITCH\n<P ID=\"dia\">Have you ever considered the fact that you are completely wasting your life?\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHRIS\n<P ID=\"dia\">Constantly.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">The lights on campus come back on as Chris and Mitch continue to follow the beam.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"slug\">INT. WAVE TANK BUILDING\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">An open window above the door lets the beam of light enter. Chris and Mitch enter.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"slug\">INT.

WAVE TANK ROOM-CONTINUOUS\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">The place has been turned into an indoor Waikiki. The beam has been directed into a hood-shaped device that has split it into enough rays to cook a bunch of hot dogs and hamburgers on an improvised barbeque, managed by ICK, who is dressed for the beach and wearing a welding mask.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">Past him we can see that there about twenty girls and some guys present. Several of them are water-skiing on the mechanically produced waves inside the tank, towed by an elaborated pulleys system. Others are frolicking on the \"beach\" and cut out palms stand around, achieving the desired effect. Blankets have been laid out and girls sit on them eating hot dogs and talking. There are sun lamps set up in one area and some kids are smoothing sun tan oil and shagging a few rays. Rock music fills the room.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ICK \n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(lifts his mask)\n<P ID=\"dia\">Aloha.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">ANGLE ON THE DOORWAY\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">A lot of the guys we've seen around the dorm have started to arrive. They enter hesitantly at Chris's urging.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHRIS\n<P ID=\"dia\">Come on in, boys. Surf's up.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">Awestruck, shy but excited, they approach.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CORNELL\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(a nerdy student)\n<P ID=\"dia\">I have a geochemistry test tomorrow and I do not feel adequately prepared.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHRIS\n<P ID=\"dia\">But the main thing is you look good.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CORNELL\n<P ID=\"dia\">Thanks.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MILTON\n<P ID=\"dia\">What if we end up having too much fun and end up failing?\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHRIS\n<P ID=\"dia\">And would that be the end of the world. Milton?\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MILTON\n<P ID=\"dia\">Yes, it would.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHRIS\n<P ID=\"dia\">Yeah, you're right. Maybe you should go back to the library.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MILTON\n<P ID=\"dia\">Well, maybe I could just look for a minute.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CORNELL\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(noticing)\n<P ID=\"dia\">Are those girls?\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHRIS\n<P ID=\"dia\">I haven't had them all tested yet, Cornell, but so far so good.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MITCH\n<P ID=\"dia\">Who are they?\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MILTON\n<P ID=\"dia\">They're not from here.

Let's get serious here, lads. There are 670 guys at pacific tech and 136 girls.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MILTON\n<P ID=\"dia\">A ratio of 4.93 to 1\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHRIS\n<P ID=\"dia\">Good, Milton. Of the 136 girls, most of them can find guys a lot better than you.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CORNELL\n<P ID=\"dia\">Oh, easily.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHRIS\n<P ID=\"dia\">These girls are not used to geniuses. You might impress them.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CORNELL\n<P ID=\"dia\">I don't see how.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHRIS\n<P ID=\"dia\">Let me put this another way. Given the type of people you are and the environment you're in, you guys have to admit the strong probability that this may be the only chance you'll ever get in your entire lives to have sex.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">There is a pause while everyone considers the hypothesis.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHRIS (CONT'D)\n<P ID=\"dia\">Think about it.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">He turns and heads into the party. After a beat, everyone except Mitch follows Chris's lead.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">ANGLES ON VARIOUS ACTIVITIES- A LITTLE LATER\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">Water-skiing, dancing, a volleyball game. Most of the guys are making an effort to socialize. Mitch watches quietly.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">ANGLE ON MILTON TALKING TO A GIRL OVER BY THE SUN LAMPS.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">VIVIAN\n<P ID=\"dia\">So, what do you guys do?

Cornell still has his glasses on. He takes them off and can't see.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">LOUISA\n<P ID=\"dia\">Why do you wear those glasses?\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CORNELL\n<P ID=\"dia\">So I can see.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">LOUISA\n<P ID=\"dia\">But you look very sexy without them.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">Reflexively he breaks his glasses in his hands.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">ANGLE ON MILTON AND VIVIAN.

Some are making out. Mitch now seems like the only one left out. he sees a pretty GIRL just coming out of the water. She adjusts her top. Mitch wanders over to her.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MITCH\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(with great effort)\n<P ID=\"dia\">Hi.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">TAMMY\n<P ID=\"dia\">Hi.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MITCH \n<P ID=\"dia\">I was watching you...swim.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">TAMMY\n<P ID=\"dia\">Yes?\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MITCH \n<P ID=\"dia\">I was thinking of maybe going for a swim myself.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">TAMMY\n<P ID=\"dia\">Yeah? Is this the kiddy pool?\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">She exits, leaving Mitch devastated. He goes and sits in a corner. Meanwhile, Chris is looking around proudly. It's obvious he didn't see what just happen to Mitch. He smiles at the fun everyone is having. A girl passes him eating a hamburger.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHRIS\n<P ID=\"dia\">Don't eat that!\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">KIMBERLY\n<P ID=\"dia\">Huh?\n\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHRIS\n<P ID=\"dia\">Don't you know eating that stuff can give you very large breasts?\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(mock despair)\n<P ID=\"dia\">Oh. My god! I see I'm too late.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">She laughs. He puts his arms around her and they walk off. As Chris and Kimberly EXIT, we catch a glimpse of a face in a window. We push in to see Kent, spying.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"slug\">INT. CLASSROOM-SAME TIME (BUT APPEARS TO BE DAY)\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">OPEN TIGHT on Atherton's face. He looks odd, as there are Kleenex tissues sticking out from his shirt collar. A hand comes into frame, holding a pancake makeup puff, and starts applying it to his face.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ATHERTON\n<P ID=\"dia\">Christ, Don. I'm doing the best I can.  You act like I don't want my own invention to work. There are only so many hours in a day.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">CAMERA PULLS BACK\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CARMICHAEL\n<P ID=\"dia\">I agree.

What's a whiss?\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHRIS\n<P ID=\"dia\">I think they meant wuss, but it didn't rhyme...when I was three years old, I balanced my father's checkbook so they sent me to school and fired their accountant. My father was so intimidated, he stopped speaking to me. My teacher disliked me because I was smarter than they were, and my classmates hated me because I bell the bell curve. Sound familiar? And tell me why my...why did my mother dress me in white shirts, hush puppies and a briefcase, guaranteeing that a girl would never talk to me?\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">Mitch looks down at his own white shirt and hush puppies.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MITCH\n<P ID=\"dia\">YOU?\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHRIS\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(Dramatic)\n<P ID=\"dia\">And then one night, in this room, I was sitting right where you are sitting now.

So brilliant, so sharp, so advanced, so long.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MITCH\n<P ID=\"dia\">What do you mean?\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHRIS\n<P ID=\"dia\">He graduated. Went to work for some chemical company. One day someone told him he was making stuff that was killing people. I think it was his mother. He freaked. You see, he was totally unprepared for the real world. He had no philosophy. He thought science was the answer for everything.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">Mitch\n<P ID=\"dia\">Am I gonna wind up in a steam tunnel?\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHRIS\n<P ID=\"dia\">Yes, you are, Metaphorically speaking. Unless you see that the same thing that has made your life miserable can make it great; your brain. When you're smart, people need you, and you can learn how to work that for fun and profit.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MITCH\n<P ID=\"dia\">You had a arrangement going with Atherton, don't you? That's why you don't have to study.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHRIS\n<P ID=\"dia\">Hey, I don't carry a briefcase.\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(pause) \n<P ID=\"dia\">You're a nice kid. If you leave I'll miss you.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MITCH\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(thinking about it)\n<P ID=\"dia\">If I stay, what should I do, I mean...\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHRIS\n<P ID=\"dia\">Well, the first thing you have to do is get even with Kent.

Chris tries to shut it down but to now avail. he tears the cover off in hopes of pulling the wiring, but he's too late. We see everything melting away as the machine eats itself. We also see a message left for Chris just before it too melts.

Well, the mistake we've been making up to now is in trying to kick up the power by means of yet another outside source. Big and bulky, right? Well, the elegance of this is that by reflecting part of the lasing light back in the gas jets we supercharge the whole deal, increasing the power tenfold with no increase in size.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">KENT\n<P ID=\"dia\">This is a complete waste of time.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">Mitch has been preparing the laser for demonstration. He is struggling to lift several thick metal plates.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHRIS\n<P ID=\"dia\">Kent, make yourself useful for once and help put those plates against the wall.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">Kent does and everyone stands back.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHRIS (CONT'D)\n<P ID=\"dia\">Okay, Mitch do it. This should work.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">Mitch switches on the main laser. It comes to life.

And now, cross your fingers.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">He throws a switch. There's a beat. And then, suddenly, the beam glows intensely brighter, cuts through the plate, the  cabinets behind it and through the wall out into the night. Chris and Mitch jump shut the whole thing off.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHRIS\n<P ID=\"dia\">Sorry about the wall, sir.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">KENT\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(looking through the hole)\n<P ID=\"dia\">And the tree across the quad.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ATHERTON\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(in awe)\n<P ID=\"dia\">Screw the wall, you did it!

Kent returns, rolling a circular precision mirror one meter in diameter.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">KENT\n<P ID=\"dia\">See! Do you have any idea how hard it is to make a film virtually 100 per cent reflective, one micron thick and apply it to a mirror this shape?\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ATHERTON\n<P ID=\"dia\">Good, Kent.\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(to Chris, in a hurry)\n<P ID=\"dia\">I have to go.

STREET-NIGHT\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">They look high up at a hole where the beam went through a telephone pole and then across the street, even higher, where it burned through a billboard on top of tavern. They cheer.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"slug\">INT. BAR-LATER\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">Our group is celebrating. The jukebox blares. Chris and Ick are drinking beers; Mitch and Jordan are holding hands, sharing a milkshake and feeding each other French fries.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MITCH\n<P ID=\"dia\">I don't think I'm ready for that yet. Maybe we should wait a year; at least until I get my license.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">JORDAN\n<P ID=\"dia\">I understand. There are a lot of things to be considered here. For example, I could drive.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">Hopsfield enters and sits down at the table.

Industrial for one.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">HOPSFIELD\n<P ID=\"dia\">With the gas tanks you've designed the beam would only last for forty seconds. What good is that?\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHRIS\n<P ID=\"dia\">I don't care, Laslo. I graduated.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MITCH\n<P ID=\"dia\">Let the engineers figure out a use for it. That's not our concern.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">HOPSFIELD\n<P ID=\"dia\">Maybe somebody already has a use for it, one for which it's perfectly designed.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">JORDAN\n<P ID=\"dia\">You mean Atherton had something in mind all along?\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">HOPSFIELD\n<P ID=\"dia\">Looks at the facts: very high power, portable, limited firing time, unlimited range. All you'd need is a big spinning mirror and you could vaporize a human target from space.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">Hopsfield gets up and walks outside. Silence for a beat.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHRIS\n<P ID=\"dia\">This is not good.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ICK \n<P ID=\"dia\">You want another beer?\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MITCH\n<P ID=\"dia\">How big a mirror?\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"slug\">INT.

The Royal order of Friendly Weasels.  Every Wednesday when I was eight, he'd take me down to his lodge meeting and he'd challenge people to call out two five-digit numbers. I had to multiply them in my head faster than a guy could do it on a calculator. They'd bet on me.

Everything you said was copied word for word from my book and I expect a lot of money for it.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ATHERTON (V.O.)\n<P ID=\"dia\">Need I remind you, it's public television, an attempt to teach people something.

Hopsfield gets out.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">HOPSFIELD\n<P ID=\"dia\">I think  you used too much.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHRIS\n<P ID=\"dia\">Really? I'm sorry you missed it.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">HOPSFIELD\n<P ID=\"dia\">Yeah, well, I had to pack.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHRIS\n<P ID=\"dia\">Why?\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">HOPSFIELD\n<P ID=\"dia\">I'm getting married.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHRIS\n<P ID=\"dia\">What? To whom?\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MITCH \n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(looking at the U-Haul)\n<P ID=\"dia\">What is all this?\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">HOPSFIELD\n<P ID=\"dia\">Oh, I won. Only thirty-one point eight percent though. I have to figure that out. But not this summer.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">Mitch suddenly sees Sherry standing at the Winnebago door.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MITCH\n<P ID=\"dia\">Sherry?\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">SHERRY \n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(kissing Hopsfield)\n<P ID=\"dia\">Hi. Isn't it wonderful. I finally found him. Number  One. I've been looking for him for ten years.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">HOPSFIELD\n<P ID=\"dia\">What can I do?  She loves me.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHRIS\n<P ID=\"dia\">Right.  Congratulations.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">HOPSFIELD\n<P ID=\"dia\">Thanks.  Anyway, we probably won't ever get to see you again, so, bye.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHRIS\n<P ID=\"dia\">What do you mean?  Where are you going?\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">SHERRY\n<P ID=\"dia\">I've got a little survival place in Wyoming.  We're going to live there.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">HOPSFIELD\n<P ID=\"dia\">Yeah, it's getting too weird around here.  See ya.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">They climb into the Winnebago and it pulls away. The others watch it go.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ICK \n<P ID=\"dia\">You think it's getting too weird around here.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CHRIS\n<P ID=\"dia\">Absolutely.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">JORDAN\n<P ID=\"dia\">I didn't notice.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MITCH\n<P ID=\"dia\">I like it.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">In the background, the popcorn has split the walls of the house and finally lifts the roof off like the top of a pot. The whole house tilts to its side and the popping stops.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">As we PULL BACK, Atherton's car pulls up and he gets out, dumbstruck.  Dr. Meredith walks over to him and confronts him. Kent joins Chris and the others who watch.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">THE END.\n\n<\/div>\n\n<b>\n<\/b><b>\n<\/b>\n<b><\/b><\/pre><br>\n<table width=\"85%\" border=\"0\" align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"body\" style=\"BORDER-TOP: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 1px solid;\">\n  <tr> \n\t<td align=center>\n\t<td><h1>Real Genius<\/h1><br><br>\n\t    <b>Writers<\/b> : &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=\"\/writer.php?w=Neal Israel\" title=\"Scripts by Neal Israel\">Neal Israel<\/a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=\"\/writer.php?w=Pat Proft\" title=\"Scripts by Pat Proft\">Pat Proft<\/a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=\"\/writer.php?w=Peter Torokvel\" title=\"Scripts by Peter Torokvel\">Peter Torokvel<\/a><br>\n    \t<b>Genres<\/b> : &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=\"\/genre\/Comedy\" title=\"Comedy Scripts\">Comedy<\/a><br><br><br>\n\t\t\n\t\t<a href=\"\/Movie Scripts\/Real Genius Script.html#comments\" title=\"Real Genius comments\">User Comments<\/a>\n\t<\/td>\n<\/table>\n<br><br>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.imsdb.com\" title=\"Internet Movie Script Database\"><img src=\"\/images\/lilbutton.gif\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\"  alt=\"Internet Movie Script Database\" border=1><br>\nBack to IMSDb<\/a>\n<\/div><br>\n<br><br>\n  <\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<br><br>\n<\/table>\n\n<table width=\"99%\" border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" class=\"body\">\n  <tr> \n  <td background=\"\/images\/reel.gif\" height=\"13\" colspan=\"2\">\n<\/table>\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n <a href=\"https:\/\/www.imsdb.com\" title=\"Internet Movie Script Database (IMSDb)\">Index<\/a> \n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n <a href=\"\/submit\" title=\"Submit scripts\">Submit<\/a> \n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n <a href=\"\/links\" title=\"Other sites\">Links<\/a> \n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n <a href=\"\/link to us\" title=\"Link to IMSDb\">Link to us<\/a> \n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n <a href=\"\/feeds\" title=\"IMSDb RSS Feeds\">RSS Feeds<\/a> \n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n <a href=\"\/disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/a> \n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n <a href=\"\/privacy\">Privacy policy<\/a> \n<\/div>\n\n<br \/>\n\n<\/body>\n<\/html>","id":1232,"split":"test"}
