Carruthers agrees, as his other plans for a holiday have fallen through.\nHe arrives to find that Davies has a small sailing boat (the vessel is named Dulcibella, a reference to Childers's own sister of that name), not the comfortable crewed yacht that he expected. However Carruthers agrees to go on the trip and joins Davies in Flensburg on the Baltic, whence they head for the Frisian Islands, off the coast of Germany. Carruthers has to learn quickly how to sail the small boat.\nDavies gradually reveals that he suspects that the Germans are undertaking something sinister in the German Frisian islands. This is based on his belief that he was nearly wrecked by a German yacht luring him into a shoal in rough weather during a previous trip. Davies is suspicious about what would motivate the Germans to try to kill him. Having failed to interest anyone in the government in the incident, he feels it is his patriotic duty to investigate further \u2013 hence the invitation to Carruthers.\nCarruthers and Davies spend some time exploring the shallow tidal waters of the Frisian Islands, moving closer to the mysterious site where there is a rumoured secret treasure recovery project in progress on the island of Memmert. The two men discover that an expatriate Englishman, Dollmann, is involved in the recovery project. Carruthers realises that Davies is in love with Dollmann\u2019s daughter, Clara. Carruthers and Davies try to approach Memmert. They\u2019re warned away by a German navy patrol boat, the Blitz, and its commander Von Bruning. This makes them all the more sure that there is something more than a treasure dig on the island.\nTaking advantage of a thick fog, Davies navigates them covertly through the complicated sandbanks in a small boat to investigate the site. Carruthers investigates the island. He overhears Von Bruning and Dollmann discussing something more than treasure hunting, including cryptic references to \"Chatham\", \"Seven\" and \"the tide serving\". The pair return through the fog to the Dulcibella. There, they find Dollmann and Von Bruning have beaten them and are seemingly suspicious.\nVon Bruning invites them to Dollmann's villa for a dinner, where he attempts to subtly cross-examine them to find out if they are British spies. Carruthers plays a dangerous game, admitting they are curious. But he convinces Von Bruning that he believes the cover story about treasure and merely wants to see the imaginary \"wreck\". Carruthers announces that the Foreign Office has recalled him to England. He heads off, then doubles back to follow Von Bruning and his men. He trails them to a port where they board a tugboat towing a barge. Carruthers sneaks aboard and hides, and the convoy heads to sea.\nCarruthers finally puts the riddle together. The Germans are linking the canals and the railways, dredging passages through the shifting sands and hiding a fleet of tugs and barges. The only explanation is that they are going to secretly transport a powerful German army across the North Sea to invade Britain\u2019s east coast. He escapes after grounding the tugboat and rushes back to Davies. He finds him and explains how they must flee before the Germans come after them. They convince Dollmann and Clara to come with them to avoid Dollmann's being arrested by the Germans, who will think he has changed sides again. As they sail across the North Sea, Dollmann commits suicide by jumping overboard, presumably to avoid disgrace and probable arrest for treason.\nAn epilogue by the \"editor\" examines the details of a report prepared by Dollmann, outlining his plan for the invasion force. A postscript notes that the Royal Navy is finally taking countermeasures to intercept any German invasion fleet and urges haste.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of The Riddle of the Sands, by Erskine Childers\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

Till then I had\nonly known as much as the rest of his friends, namely, that he had\nrecently undergone experiences during a yachting cruise with a\ncertain Mr 'Davies' which had left a deep mark on his character and\nhabits.\n\nAt the end of his narrative--which, from its bearing on studies and\nspeculations of my own, as well as from its intrinsic interest and\nracy delivery, made a very deep impression on me--he added that the\nimportant facts discovered in the course of the cruise had, without a\nmoment's delay, been communicated to the proper authorities, who,\nafter some dignified incredulity, due in part, perhaps, to the\npitiful inadequacy of their own secret service, had, he believed,\nmade use of them, to avert a great national danger. I say 'he\nbelieved', for though it was beyond question that the danger was\naverted for the time, it was doubtful whether they had stirred a foot\nto combat it, the secret discovered being of such a nature that mere\nsuspicion of it on this side was likely to destroy its efficacy.\n\nThere, however that may be, the matter rested for a while, as, for\npersonal reasons which will be manifest to the reader, he and Mr\n'Davies' expressly wished it to rest.\n\nBut events were driving them to reconsider their decision. These\nseemed to show that the information wrung with such peril and labour\nfrom the German Government, and transmitted so promptly to our own,\nhad had none but the most transitory influence on our policy. Forced\nto the conclusion that the national security was really being\nneglected, the two friends now had a mind to make their story public;\nand it was about this that 'Carruthers' wished for my advice. The\ngreat drawback was that an Englishman, bearing an honoured name, was\ndisgracefully implicated, and that unless infinite delicacy were\nused, innocent persons, and, especially, a young lady, would suffer\npain and indignity, if his identity were known. Indeed, troublesome\nrumours, containing a grain of truth and a mass of falsehood, were\nalready afloat.\n\nAfter weighing both sides of the question, I gave my vote\nemphatically for publication. The personal drawbacks could, I\nthought, with tact be neutralized; while, from the public point of\nview, nothing but good could come from submitting the case to the\ncommon sense of the country at large. Publication, therefore, was\nagreed upon, and the next point was the form it should take.\n'Carruthers', with the concurrence of Mr 'Davies', was for a bald\nexposition of the essential facts, stripped of their warm human\nenvelope. I was strongly against this course, first, because it would\naggravate instead of allaying the rumours that were current;\nsecondly, because in such a form the narrative would not carry\nconviction, and would thus defeat its own end. The persons and the\nevents were indissolubly connected; to evade, abridge, suppress,\nwould be to convey to the reader the idea of a concocted hoax.\nIndeed, I took bolder ground still, urging that the story should be\nmade as explicit and circumstantial as possible, frankly and honestly\nfor the purpose of entertaining and so of attracting a wide circle of\nreaders. Even anonymity was undesirable. Nevertheless, certain\nprecautions were imperatively needed.\n\nTo cut the matter short, they asked for my assistance and received it\nat once. It was arranged that I should edit the book; that\n'Carruthers' should give me his diary and recount to me in fuller\ndetail and from his own point of view all the phases of the 'quest',\nas they used to call it; that Mr 'Davies' should meet me with his\ncharts and maps and do the same; and that the whole story should be\nwritten, as from the mouth of the former, with its humours and\nerrors, its light and its dark side, just as it happened; with the\nfollowing few limitations. The year it belongs to is disguised; the\nnames of persons are throughout fictitious; and, at my instance\ncertain slight liberties have been taken to conceal the identity of\nthe English characters.\n\nRemember, also that these persons are living now in the midst of us,\nand if you find one topic touched on with a light and hesitating pen,\ndo not blame the Editor, who, whether they are known or not, would\nrather say too little than say a word that might savour of\nimpertinence.\n\nE. C.\n\nMarch 1903\n\nNOTE\n\nThe maps and charts are based on British and German Admiralty charts,\nwith irrelevant details omitted.\n\n\n\n\nI. The Letter\n\n\nI HAVE read of men who, when forced by their calling to live for long\nperiods in utter solitude--save for a few black faces--have made it a\nrule to dress regularly for dinner in order to maintain their\nself-respect and prevent a relapse into barbarism. It was in some\nsuch spirit, with an added touch of self-consciousness, that, at\nseven o'clock in the evening of September 23 in a recent year, I\nwas making my evening toilet in my chambers in Pall Mall. I thought\nthe date and the place justified the parallel; to my advantage even;\nfor the obscure Burmese administrator might well be a man of blunted\nsensibilities and coarse fibre, and at least he is alone with nature,\nwhile I--well, a young man of condition and fashion, who knows the\nright people, belongs to the right clubs, has a safe, possibly a\nbrilliant, future in the Foreign Office--may be excused for a sense\nof complacent martyrdom, when, with his keen appreciation of the\nsocial calendar, he is doomed to the outer solitude of London in\nSeptember. I say 'martyrdom', but in fact the case was infinitely\nworse. For to feel oneself a martyr, as everybody knows, is a\npleasurable thing, and the true tragedy of my position was that I had\npassed that stage. I had enjoyed what sweets it had to offer in ever\ndwindling degree since the middle of August, when ties were still\nfresh and sympathy abundant. I had been conscious that I was missed\nat Morven Lodge party. Lady Ashleigh herself had said so in the\nkindest possible manner, when she wrote to acknowledge the letter in\nwhich I explained, with an effectively austere reserve of language,\nthat circumstances compelled me to remain at my office. 'We know how\nbusy you must be just now', she wrote, 'and I do hope you won't\noverwork; we shall _all_ miss you very much.' Friend after friend\n'got away' to sport and fresh air, with promises to write and\nchaffing condolences, and as each deserted the sinking ship, I took a\ngrim delight in my misery, positively almost enjoying the first week\nor two after my world had been finally dissipated to the four bracing\nwinds of heaven. I began to take a spurious interest in the remaining\nfive millions, and wrote several clever letters in a vein of cheap\nsatire, indirectly suggesting the pathos of my position, but indicating\nthat I was broad-minded enough to find intellectual entertainment in the\nscenes, persons, and habits of London in the dead season. I even did\nrational things at the instigation of others. For, though I should have\nliked total isolation best, I, of course, found that there was a\nsediment of unfortunates like myself, who, unlike me, viewed the\nsituation in a most prosaic light. There were river excursions, and so\non, after office-hours; but I dislike the river at any time for its\nnoisy vulgarity, and most of all at this season. So I dropped out of the\nfresh air brigade and declined H----'s offer to share a riverside\ncottage and run up to town in the mornings. I did spend one or two week-\nends with the Catesbys in Kent; but I was not inconsolable when they let\ntheir house and went abroad, for I found that such partial compensations\ndid not suit me. Neither did the taste for satirical observation last. A\npassing thirst, which I dare say many have shared, for adventures of the\nfascinating kind described in the _New Arabian Nights_ led me on a few\nevenings into some shady haunts in Soho and farther eastward; but was\nfinally quenched one sultry Saturday night after an hour's immersion in\nthe reeking atmosphere of a low music-hall in Ratcliffe Highway, where I\nsat next a portly female who suffered from the heat, and at frequent\nintervals refreshed herself and an infant from a bottle of tepid stout.\n\nBy the first week in September I had abandoned all palliatives, and\nhad settled into the dismal but dignified routine of office, club,\nand chambers. And now came the most cruel trial, for the hideous\ntruth dawned on me that the world I found so indispensable could\nafter all dispense with me. It was all very well for Lady Ashleigh to\nassure me that I was deeply missed; but a letter from F----, who was\none of the party, written 'in haste, just starting to shoot', and\ncoming as a tardy reply to one of my cleverest, made me aware that\nthe house party had suffered little from my absence, and that few\nsighs were wasted on me, even in the quarter which I had assumed to\nhave been discreetly alluded to by the underlined _all_ in Lady\nAshleigh's 'we shall _all_ miss you'. A thrust which smarted more, if\nit bit less deeply, came from my cousin Nesta, who wrote: 'It's\nhorrid for you to have to be baking in London now; but, after all, it\nmust be a great pleasure to you' (malicious little wretch!) 'to have\nsuch interesting and important work to do.' Here was a nemesis for an\ninnocent illusion I had been accustomed to foster in the minds of my\nrelations and acquaintances, especially in the breasts of the\ntrustful and admiring maidens whom I had taken down to dinner in the\nlast two seasons; a fiction which I had almost reached the point of\nbelieving in myself. For the plain truth was that my work was neither\ninteresting nor important, and consisted chiefly at present in\nsmoking cigarettes, in saying that Mr So-and-So was away and would be\nback about October 1, in being absent for lunch from twelve till\ntwo, and in my spare moments making _pr\u00c3\u00a9cis_ of--let us say--the less\nconfidential consular reports, and squeezing the results into\ncast-iron schedules. The reason of my detention was not a cloud on\nthe international horizon--though I may say in passing that there was\nsuch a cloud--but a caprice on the part of a remote and mighty\npersonage, the effect of which, ramifying downwards, had dislocated\nthe carefully-laid holiday plans of the humble juniors, and in my own\nsmall case had upset the arrangement between myself and K----, who\npositively liked the dog-days in Whitehall.\n\nOnly one thing was needed to fill my cup of bitterness, and this it\nwas that specially occupied me as I dressed for dinner this evening.\nTwo days more in this dead and fermenting city and my slavery would\nbe at an end. Yes, but--irony of ironies!--I had nowhere to go to!\nThe Morven Lodge party was breaking up. A dreadful rumour as to an\nengagement which had been one of its accursed fruits tormented me\nwith the fresh certainty that I had not been missed, and bred in me\nthat most desolating brand of cynicism which is produced by defeat\nthrough insignificance. Invitations for a later date, which I had\ndeclined in July with a gratifying sense of being much in request,\nnow rose up spectrally to taunt me. There was at least one which I\ncould easily have revived, but neither in this case nor in any other\nhad there been any renewal of pressure, and there are moments when\nthe difference between proposing oneself and surrendering as a prize\nto one of several eagerly competing hostesses seems too crushing to\nbe contemplated. My own people were at Aix for my father's gout; to\njoin them was a _pis-aller_ whose banality was repellent. Besides,\nthey would be leaving soon for our home in Yorkshire, and I was not a\nprophet in my own country. In short, I was at the extremity of\ndepression.\n\nThe usual preliminary scuffle on the staircase prepared me for the\nknock and entry of Withers. (One of the things which had for some\ntime ceased to amuse me was the laxity of manners, proper to the\nseason, among the servants of the big block of chambers where I\nlived.) Withers demurely handed me a letter bearing a German\npostmark and marked 'Urgent'. I had just finished dressing, and was\ncollecting my money and gloves. A momentary thrill of curiosity broke\nin upon my depression as I sat down to open it. A corner on the\nreverse of the envelope bore the blotted legend: 'Very sorry, but\nthere's one other thing--a pair of rigging screws from Carey and\nNeilson's, size 1-3\/8, _galvanized_.' Here it is:\n\n\nYacht _Dulcibella_\n\nFlensburg, Schleswig-Holstein, _Sept_. 21\n\n_Dear Carruthers_,--\n\nI daresay you'll be surprised at hearing from me,\nas it's ages since we met. It is more than likely, too, that what I'm\ngoing to suggest won't suit you, for I know nothing of your plans,\nand if you're in town at all you're probably just getting into\nharness again and can't get away. So I merely write on the offchance\nto ask if you would care to come out here and join me in a little\nyachting, and, I hope, duck shooting. I know you're keen on shooting,\nand I sort of remember that you have done some yachting too, though I\nrather forget about that. This part of the Baltic--the Schleswig\nfiords--is a splendid cruising-ground--A 1 scenery--and there ought to\nbe plenty of duck about soon, if it gets cold enough. I came out here\n_via_ Holland and the Frisian Islands, starting early in August. My\npals have had to leave me, and I'm badly in want of another, as I\ndon't want to lay up yet for a bit. I needn't say how glad I should\nbe if you could come. If you can, send me a wire to the P.O. here.\nFlushing and on by Hamburg will be your best route, I think. I'm\nhaving a few repairs done here, and will have them ready sharp by the\ntime your train arrives. Bring your gun and a good lot of No. 4's;\nand would you mind calling at Lancaster's and asking for mine, and\nbringing it too? Bring some oilskins. Better get the eleven-shilling\nsort, jacket and trousers--not the 'yachting' brand; and if you paint\nbring your gear. I know you speak German like a native, and that will\nbe a great help. Forgive this hail of directions, but I've a sort of\nfeeling that I'm in luck and that you'll come. Anyway, I hope you and\nthe F.O. both flourish. Good-bye.\n\nYours ever,\n\n_Arthur H. Davies_.\n\nWould you mind bringing me out a _prismatic compass_, and a pound of\nRaven mixture?\n\nThis letter marked an epoch for me; but I little suspected the fact\nas I crumpled it into my pocket and started languidly on the _voie\ndouloureuse_ which I nightly followed to the club. In Pall Mall there\nwere no dignified greetings to be exchanged now with well-groomed\nacquaintances. The only people to be seen were some late stragglers\nfrom the park, with a perambulator and some hot and dusty children\nlagging fretfully behind; some rustic sightseers draining the last\ndregs of the daylight in an effort to make out from their guide-books\nwhich of these reverend piles was which; a policeman and a builder's\ncart. Of course the club was a strange one, both of my own being\nclosed for cleaning, a coincidence expressly planned by Providence\nfor my inconvenience. The club which you are 'permitted to make use\nof' on these occasions always irritates with its strangeness and\ndiscomfort. The few occupants seem odd and oddly dressed, and you\nwonder how they got there. The particular weekly that you want is not\ntaken in; the dinner is execrable, and the ventilation a farce. All\nthese evils oppressed me to-night. And yet I was puzzled to find that\nsomewhere within me there was a faint lightening of the spirits;\ncauseless, as far as I could discover. It could not be Davies's\nletter. Yachting in the Baltic at the end of September! The very idea\nmade one shudder. Cowes, with a pleasant party and hotels handy, was\nall very well. An August cruise on a steam yacht in French waters or\nthe Highlands was all very well; but what kind of a yacht was this?\nIt must be of a certain size to have got so far, but I thought I\nremembered enough of Davies's means to know that he had no money to\nwaste on luxuries. That brought me to the man himself. I had known\nhim at Oxford--not as one of my immediate set; but we were a sociable\ncollege, and I had seen a good deal of him, liking him for his\nphysical energy combined with a certain simplicity and modesty,\nthough, indeed, he had nothing to be conceited about; liked him, in\nfact, in the way that at that receptive period one likes many men\nwhom one never keeps up with later. We had both gone down in the same\nyear--three years ago now. I had gone to France and Germany for two\nyears to learn the languages; he had failed for the Indian Civil, and\nthen had gone into a solicitor's office. I had only seen him since at\nrare intervals, though I admitted to myself that for his part he had\nclung loyally to what ties of friendship there were between us. But\nthe truth was that we had drifted apart from the nature of things. I\nhad passed brilliantly into my profession, and on the few occasions I\nhad met him since I made my triumphant _d\u00c3\u00a9but_ in society I had found\nnothing left in common between us. He seemed to know none of my\nfriends, he dressed indifferently, and I thought him dull. I had\nalways connected him with boats and the sea, but never with yachting,\nin the sense that I understood it. In college days he had nearly\npersuaded me into sharing a squalid week in some open boat he had\npicked up, and was going to sail among some dreary mudflats\nsomewhere on the east coast. There was nothing else, and the funereal\nfunction of dinner drifted on. But I found myself remembering at the\n_entr\u00c3\u00a9e_ that I had recently heard, at second or third hand, of\nsomething else about him--exactly what I could not recall. When I\nreached the savoury, I had concluded, so far as I had centred my mind\non it at all, that the whole thing was a culminating irony, as,\nindeed, was the savoury in its way. After the wreck of my pleasant\nplans and the fiasco of my martyrdom, to be asked as consolation to\nspend October freezing in the Baltic with an eccentric nonentity who\nbored me! Yet, as I smoked my cigar in the ghastly splendour of the\nempty smoking-room, the subject came up again. Was there anything in\nit? There were certainly no alternatives at hand. And to bury myself\nin the Baltic at this unearthly time of year had at least a smack of\ntragic thoroughness about it.\n\nI pulled out the letter again, and ran down its impulsive staccato\nsentences, affecting to ignore what a gust of fresh air, high\nspirits, and good fellowship this flimsy bit of paper wafted into the\njaded club-room. On reperusal, it was full of evil presage--'A 1\nscenery'--but what of equinoctial storms and October fogs? Every sane\nyachtsman was paying off his crew now. 'There ought to be\nduck'--vague, very vague. 'If it gets cold enough'--cold and\nyachting seemed to be a gratuitously monstrous union. His pals had\nleft him; why? 'Not the \"yachting\" brand'; and why not? As to the\nsize, comfort, and crew of the yacht--all cheerfully ignored; so many\nmaddening blanks. And, by the way, why in Heaven's name 'a prismatic\ncompass'? I fingered a few magazines, played a game of fifty with a\nfriendly old fogey, too importunate to be worth the labour of\nresisting, and went back to my chambers to bed, ignorant that a\nfriendly Providence had come to my rescue; and, indeed, rather\nresenting any clumsy attempt at such friendliness.\n\n\n\n\nII. The _Dulcibella_\n\n\nTHAT two days later I should be found pacing the deck of the Flushing\nsteamer with a ticket for Hamburg in my pocket may seem a strange\nresult, yet not so strange if you have divined my state of mind. You\nwill guess, at any rate, that I was armed with the conviction that I\nwas doing an act of obscure penance, rumours of which might call\nattention to my lot and perhaps awaken remorse in the right quarter,\nwhile it left me free to enjoy myself unobtrusively in the remote\nevent of enjoyment being possible.\n\nThe fact was that, at breakfast on the morning after the arrival of\nthe letter, I had still found that inexplicable lightening which I\nmentioned before, and strong enough to warrant a revival of the pros\nand cons. An important pro which I had not thought of before was that\nafter all it was a good-natured piece of unselfishness to join\nDavies; for he had spoken of the want of a pal, and seemed honestly\nto be in need of me. I almost clutched at this consideration. It was\nan admirable excuse, when I reached my office that day, for a\nresigned study of the Continental Bradshaw, and an order to Carter to\nunroll a great creaking wall-map of Germany and find me Flensburg.\nThe latter labour I might have saved him, but it was good for Carter\nto have something to do; and his patient ignorance was amusing. With\nmost of the map and what it suggested I was tolerably familiar, for I\nhad not wasted my year in Germany, whatever I had done or not done\nsince. Its people, history, progress, and future had interested me\nintensely, and I had still friends in Dresden and Berlin. Flensburg\nrecalled the Danish war of '64, and by the time Carter's researches\nhad ended in success I had forgotten the task set him, and was\nwondering whether the prospect of seeing something of that lovely\nregion of Schleswig-Holstein, _[See Map A]_ as I knew from hearsay\nthat it was, was at all to be set against such an uncomfortable way\nof seeing it, with the season so late, the company so unattractive,\nand all the other drawbacks which I counted and treasured as proofs\nof my desperate condition, if I _were_ to go. It needed little to\ndecide me, and I think K----'s arrival from Switzerland, offensively\nsunburnt, was the finishing touch. His greeting was 'Hullo,\nCarruthers, you here? Thought you had got away long ago. Lucky devil,\nthough, to be going now, just in time for the best driving and the\nearly pheasants. The heat's been shocking out there. Carter, bring me\na Bradshaw'--(an extraordinary book, Bradshaw, turned to from habit,\neven when least wanted, as men fondle guns and rods in the close\nseason).\n\nBy lunch-time the weight of indecision had been removed, and I found\nmyself entrusting Carter with a telegram to Davies, P.O., Flensburg.\n'Thanks; expect me 9.34 p.m. 26th'; which produced, three hours\nlater, a reply: 'Delighted; please bring a No. 3 Rippingille\nstove'--a perplexing and ominous direction, which somehow chilled me\nin spite of its subject matter.\n\nIndeed, my resolution was continually faltering. It faltered when I\nturned out my gun in the evening and thought of the grouse it ought\nto have accounted for. It faltered again when I contemplated the\nmiscellaneous list of commissions, sown broadcast through Davies's\nletter, to fulfil which seemed to make me a willing tool where my\nchosen _r\u00c3\u00b4le_ was that of an embittered exile, or at least a\ncondescending ally. However, I faced the commissions manfully, after\nleaving the office.\n\nAt Lancaster's I inquired for his gun, was received coolly, and had to\npay a heavy bill, which it seemed to have incurred, before it was handed\nover. Having ordered the gun and No. 4's to be sent to my chambers, I\nbought the Raven mixture with that peculiar sense of injury which the\nprospect of smuggling in another's behalf always entails; and wondered\nwhere in the world Carey and Neilson's was, a firm which Davies spoke of\nas though it were as well known as the Bank of England or the Stores,\ninstead of specializing in 'rigging-screws', whatever they might be.\nThey sounded important, though, and it would be only polite to unearth\nthem. I connected them with the 'few repairs,' and awoke new misgivings.\nAt the Stores I asked for a No. 3 Rippingille stove, and was confronted\nwith a formidable and hideous piece of ironmongery, which burned\npetroleum in two capacious tanks, horribly prophetic of a smell of warm\noil. I paid for this miserably, convinced of its grim efficiency, but\nspeculating as to the domestic conditions which caused it to be sent for\nas an afterthought by telegram. I also asked about rigging-screws in the\nyachting department, but learnt that they were not kept in stock; that\nCarey and Neilson's would certainly have them, and that their shop was\nin the Minories, in the far east, meaning a journey nearly as long as to\nFlensburg, and twice as tiresome. They would be shut by the time I got\nthere, so after this exhausting round of duty I went home in a cab,\nomitted dressing for dinner (an epoch in itself), ordered a chop up from\nthe basement kitchen, and spent the rest of the evening packing and\nwriting, with the methodical gloom of a man setting his affairs in order\nfor the last time.\n\nThe last of those airless nights passed. The astonished Withers saw\nme breakfasting at eight, and at 9.30 I was vacantly examining\nrigging-screws with what wits were left me after a sulphurous ride in\nthe underground to Aldgate. I laid great stress on the 3\/8's, and the\ngalvanism, and took them on trust, ignorant as to their functions.\nFor the eleven-shilling oilskins I was referred to a villainous den\nin a back street, which the shopman said they always recommended, and\nwhere a dirty and bejewelled Hebrew chaffered with me (beginning at\n18s.) over two reeking orange slabs distantly resembling moieties of\nthe human figure. Their odour made me close prematurely for 14_s_., and\nI hurried back (for I was due there at 11) to my office with my\ntwo disreputable brown-paper parcels, one of which made itself so\nnoticeable in the close official air that Carter attentively asked if\nI would like to have it sent to my chambers, and K---- was inquisitive\nto bluntness about it and my movements. But I did not care to\nenlighten K----, whose comments I knew would be provokingly envious or\nwounding to my pride in some way.\n\nI remembered, later on, the prismatic compass, and wired to the\nMinories to have one sent at once, feeling rather relieved that I was\nnot present there to be cross-examined as to size and make.\nThe reply was, 'Not stocked; try surveying-instrument maker'--a reply\nboth puzzling and reassuring, for Davies's request for a compass had\ngiven me more uneasiness than anything, while, to find that what he\nwanted turned out to be a surveying-instrument, was a no less\nperplexing discovery. That day I made my last _pr\u00c3\u00a9cis_ and handed\nover my schedules--Procrustean beds, where unwilling facts were\nstretched and tortured--and said good-bye to my temporary chief,\ngenial and lenient M----, who wished me a jolly holiday with all\nsincerity.\n\nAt seven I was watching a cab packed with my personal luggage and the\ncollection of unwieldy and incongruous packages that my shopping had\ndrawn down on me. Two deviations after that wretched prismatic\ncompass--which I obtained in the end secondhand, _faute de mieux_,\nnear Victoria, at one of those showy shops which look like jewellers'\nand are really pawnbrokers'--nearly caused me to miss my train. But\nat 8.30 I had shaken off the dust of London from my feet, and at\n10.30 I was, as I have announced, pacing the deck of a Flushing\nsteamer, adrift on this fatuous holiday in the far Baltic.\n\nAn air from the west, cooled by a midday thunderstorm, followed the\nsteamer as she slid through the calm channels of the Thames estuary,\npassed the cordon of scintillating lightships that watch over the\nsea-roads to the imperial city like pickets round a sleeping army,\nand slipped out into the dark spaces of the North Sea. Stars were\nbright, summer scents from the Kent cliffs mingled coyly with vulgar\nsteamer-smells; the summer weather held immutably. Nature, for her\npart, seemed resolved to be no party to my penance, but to be\nimperturbably bent on shedding mild ridicule over my wrongs. An\nirresistible sense of peace and detachment, combined with that\ndelicious physical awakening that pulses through the nerve-sick\ntownsman when city airs and bald routine are left behind him,\ncombined to provide me, however thankless a subject, with a solid\nbackground of resignation. Stowing this safely away, I could\ncalculate my intentions with cold egotism. If the weather held I\nmight pass a not intolerable fortnight with Davies. When it broke up,\nas it was sure to, I could easily excuse myself from the pursuit of\nthe problematical ducks; the wintry logic of facts would, in any\ncase, decide him to lay up his yacht, for he could scarcely think of\nsailing home at such a season. I could then take a chance lying ready\nof spending a few weeks in Dresden or elsewhere. I settled this\nprogramme comfortably and then turned in.\n\nFrom Flushing eastward to Hamburg, then northward to Flensburg, I cut\nshort the next day's sultry story. Past dyke and windmill and still\ncanals, on to blazing stubbles and roaring towns; at the last, after\ndusk, through a quiet level region where the train pottered from one\nlazy little station to another, and at ten o'clock I found myself,\nstiff and stuffy, on the platform at Flensburg, exchanging greetings\nwith Davies.\n\n'It's awfully good of you to come.'\n\n'Not at all; it's very good of you to ask me.'\n\nWe were both of us ill at ease. Even in the dim gaslight he clashed\non my notions of a yachtsman--no cool white ducks or neat blue serge;\nand where was the snowy crowned yachting cap, that precious charm\nthat so easily converts a landsman into a dashing mariner? Conscious\nthat this impressive uniform, in high perfection, was lying ready in\nmy portmanteau, I felt oddly guilty. He wore an old Norfolk jacket,\nmuddy brown shoes, grey flannel trousers (or had they been white?),\nand an ordinary tweed cap. The hand he gave me was horny, and\nappeared to be stained with paint; the other one, which carried a\nparcel, had a bandage on it which would have borne renewal. There was\nan instant of mutual inspection. I thought he gave me a shy, hurried\nscrutiny as though to test past conjectures, with something of\nanxiety in it, and perhaps (save the mark!) a tinge of admiration.\nThe face was familiar, and yet not familiar; the pleasant blue eyes,\nopen, clean-cut features, unintellectual forehead were the same; so\nwere the brisk and impulsive movements; there was some change; but\nthe moment of awkward hesitation was over and the light was bad; and,\nwhile strolling down the platform for my luggage, we chatted with\nconstraint about trivial things.\n\n'By the way,' he suddenly said, laughing, 'I'm afraid I'm not fit to\nbe seen; but it's so late it doesn't matter. I've been painting hard\nall day, and just got it finished. I only hope we shall have some\nwind to-morrow--it's been hopelessly calm lately. I say, you've\nbrought a good deal of stuff,' he concluded, as my belongings began\nto collect.\n\nHere was a reward for my submissive exertions in the far east!\n\n'You gave me a good many commissions!'\n\n'Oh, I didn't mean those things,' he said, absently. 'Thanks for\nbringing them, by the way. That's the stove, I suppose; cartridges,\nthis one, by the weight. You got the rigging-screws all right, I\nhope? They're not really necessary, of course' (I nodded vacantly,\nand felt a little hurt); 'but they're simpler than lanyards, and you\ncan't get them here. It's that portmanteau,' he said, slowly,\nmeasuring it with a doubtful eye. 'Never mind! we'll try. You\ncouldn't do with the Gladstone only, I suppose? You see, the\ndinghy--h'm, and there's the hatchway, too'--he was lost in thought.\n'Anyhow, we'll try. I'm afraid there are no cabs; but it's quite\nnear, and the porter'll help.'\n\nSickening forebodings crept over me, while Davies shouldered my\nGladstone and clutched at the parcels.\n\n'Aren't your men here?' I asked, faintly.\n\n'Men?' He looked confused. 'Oh, perhaps I ought to have told you, I\nnever have any paid hands; it's quite a small boat, you know--I hope\nyou didn't expect luxury. I've managed her single-handed for some\ntime. A man would be no use, and a horrible nuisance.' He revealed\nthese appalling truths with a cheerful assurance, which did nothing\nto hide a na\u00c3\u00afve apprehension of their effect on me. There was a check\nin our mobilization.\n\n'It's rather late to go on board, isn't it?' I said, in a wooden\nvoice. Someone was turning out the gaslights, and the porter yawned\nostentatiously. 'I think I'd rather sleep at an hotel to-night.' A\nstrained pause.\n\n'Oh, of course you can do that, if you like,' said Davies, in\ntransparent distress of mind. 'But it seems hardly worth while to\ncart this stuff all the way to an hotel (I believe they're all on the\nother side of the harbour), and back again to the boat to-morrow.\nShe's quite comfortable, and you're sure to sleep well, as you're\ntired.'\n\n'We can leave the things here,' I argued feebly, 'and walk over with\nmy bag.'\n\n'Oh, I shall have to go aboard anyhow,' he rejoined; 'I _never_ sleep\non shore.'\n\nHe seemed to be clinging timidly, but desperately, to some diplomatic\nend. A stony despair was invading me and paralysing resistance.\nBetter face the worst and be done with it.\n\n'Come on,' I said, grimly.\n\nHeavily loaded, we stumbled over railway lines and rubble heaps, and\ncame on the harbour. Davies led the way to a stairway, whose weedy\nsteps disappeared below in gloom.\n\n'If you'll get into the dinghy,' he said, all briskness now, 'I'll\npass the things down.'\n\nI descended gingerly, holding as a guide a sodden painter which ended\nin a small boat, and conscious that I was collecting slime on cuffs\nand trousers.\n\n'Hold up!' shouted Davies, cheerfully, as I sat down suddenly near\nthe bottom, with one foot in the water.\n\nI climbed wretchedly into the dinghy and awaited events.\n\n'Now float her up close under the quay wall, and make fast to the\nring down there,' came down from above, followed by the slack of the\nsodden painter, which knocked my cap off as it fell. 'All fast? Any\nknot'll do,' I heard, as I grappled with this loathsome task, and\nthen a big, dark object loomed overhead and was lowered into the\ndinghy. It was my portmanteau, and, placed athwart, exactly filled\nall the space amidships. 'Does it fit?' was the anxious inquiry from\naloft.\n\n'Beautifully.'\n\n'Capital!'\n\nScratching at the greasy wall to keep the dinghy close to it, I\nreceived in succession our stores, and stowed the cargo as best I\ncould, while the dinghy sank lower and lower in the water, and its\nprecarious superstructure grew higher.\n\n'Catch!' was the final direction from above, and a damp soft parcel\nhit me in the chest. 'Be careful of that, it's meat. Now back to the\nstairs!'\n\nI painfully acquiesced, and Davies appeared.\n\n'It's a bit of a load, and she's rather deep; but I _think_ we shall\nmanage,' he reflected. 'You sit right aft, and I'll row.'\n\nI was too far gone for curiosity as to how this monstrous pyramid was\nto be rowed, or even for surmises as to its foundering by the way. I\ncrawled to my appointed seat, and Davies extricated the buried sculls\nby a series of tugs, which shook the whole structure, and made us\nroll alarmingly. How he stowed himself into rowing posture I have not\nthe least idea, but eventually we were moving sluggishly out into the\nopen water, his head just visible in the bows. We had started from\nwhat appeared to be the head of a narrow loch, and were leaving\nbehind us the lights of a big town. A long frontage of lamp-lit quays\nwas on our left, with here and there the vague hull of a steamer\nalongside. We passed the last of the lights and came out into a\nbroader stretch of water, when a light breeze was blowing and dark\nhills could be seen on either shore.\n\n'I'm lying a little way down the fiord, you see,' said Davies. 'I\nhate to be too near a town, and I found a carpenter handy here-- There\nshe is! I wonder how you'll like her!'\n\nI roused myself. We were entering a little cove encircled by trees,\nand approaching a light which flickered in the rigging of a small\nvessel, whose outline gradually defined itself.\n\n'Keep her off,' said Davies, as we drew alongside.\n\nIn a moment he had jumped on deck, tied the painter, and was round at\nmy end.\n\n'You hand them up,' he ordered, 'and I'll take them.'\n\nIt was a laborious task, with the one relief that it was not far to\nhand them--a doubtful compensation, for other reasons distantly\nshaping themselves. When the stack was transferred to the deck I\nfollowed it, tripping over the flabby meat parcel, which was already\nshowing ghastly signs of disintegration under the dew. Hazily there\nfloated through my mind my last embarkation on a yacht; my faultless\nattire, the trim gig and obsequious sailors, the accommodation ladder\nflashing with varnish and brass in the August sun; the orderly, snowy\ndecks and basket chairs under the awning aft. What a contrast with\nthis sordid midnight scramble, over damp meat and littered\npacking-cases! The bitterest touch of all was a growing sense of\ninferiority and ignorance which I had never before been allowed to\nfeel in my experience of yachts.\n\nDavies awoke from another reverie over my portmanteau to say,\ncheerily: 'I'll just show you round down below first, and then we'll\nstow things away and get to bed.'\n\nHe dived down a companion ladder, and I followed cautiously. A\ncomplex odour of paraffin, past cookery, tobacco, and tar saluted my\nnostrils.\n\n'Mind your head,' said Davies, striking a match and lighting a\ncandle, while I groped into the cabin. 'You'd better sit down; it's\neasier to look round.'\n\nThere might well have been sarcasm in this piece of advice, for I\nmust have cut a ridiculous figure, peering awkwardly and suspiciously\nround, with shoulders and head bent to avoid the ceiling, which\nseemed in the half-light to be even nearer the floor than it was.\n\n'You see,' were Davies's reassuring words, 'there's plenty of room to\n_sit_ upright' (which was strictly true; but I am not very tall, and\nhe is short). 'Some people make a point of head-room, but I never\nmind much about it. That's the centreboard case,' he explained, as,\nin stretching my legs out, my knee came into contact with a sharp\nedge.\n\nI had not seen this devilish obstruction, as it was hidden beneath\nthe table, which indeed rested on it at one end. It appeared to be a\nlong, low triangle, running lengthways with the boat and dividing the\nnaturally limited space into two.\n\n'You see, she's a flat-bottomed boat, drawing very little water\nwithout the plate; that's why there's so little headroom. For deep\nwater you lower the plate; so, in one way or another, you can go\npractically anywhere.'\n\nI was not nautical enough to draw any very definite conclusions from\nthis, but what I did draw were not promising. The latter sentences\nwere spoken from the forecastle, whither Davies had crept through a\nlow sliding door, like that of a rabbit-hutch, and was already busy\nwith a kettle over a stove which I made out to be a battered and\ndisreputable twin brother of the No. 3 Rippingille.\n\n'It'll be boiling soon,' he remarked, 'and we'll have some grog.'\n\nMy eyes were used to the light now, and I took in the rest of my\nsurroundings, which may be very simply described. Two long\ncushion-covered seats flanked the cabin, bounded at the after end by\ncupboards, one of which was cut low to form a sort of miniature\nsideboard, with glasses hung in a rack above it. The deck overhead\nwas very low at each side but rose shoulder high for a space in the\nmiddle, where a 'coach-house roof' with a skylight gave additional\ncabin space. Just outside the door was a fold-up washing-stand. On\neither wall were long net-racks holding a medley of flags, charts,\ncaps, cigar-boxes, banks of yam, and such like. Across the forward\nbulkhead was a bookshelf crammed to overflowing with volumes of all\nsizes, many upside down and some coverless. Below this were a\npipe-rack, an aneroid, and a clock with a hearty tick. All the\nwoodwork was painted white, and to a less jaundiced eye than mine the\ninterior might have had an enticing look of snugness. Some Kodak\nprints were nailed roughly on the after bulkhead, and just over the\ndoorway was the photograph of a young girl.\n\n'That's my sister,' said Davies, who had emerged and saw me looking\nat it. 'Now, let's get the stuff down.' He ran up the ladder, and\nsoon my portmanteau blackened the hatchway, and a great straining and\nsqueezing began. 'I was afraid it was too big,' came down; 'I'm\nsorry, but you'll have to unpack on deck--we may be able to squash it\ndown when it's empty.'\n\nThen the wearisome tail of packages began to form a fresh stack in\nthe cramped space at my feet, and my back ached with stooping and\nmoiling in unfamiliar places. Davies came down, and with unconcealed\npride introduced me to the sleeping cabin (he called the other one\n'the saloon'). Another candle was lit and showed two short and narrow\nberths with blankets, but no sign of sheets; beneath these were\ndrawers, one set of which Davies made me master of, evidently\nthinking them a princely allowance of space for my wardrobe.\n\n'You can chuck your things down the skylight on to your berth as you\nunpack them,' he remarked. 'By the way, I doubt if there's room for\nall you've got. I suppose you couldn't manage----'\n\n'No, I couldn't,' I said shortly.\n\nThe absurdity of argument struck me; two men, doubled up like\nmonkeys, cannot argue.\n\n'If you'll go out I shall be able to get out too,' I added. He seemed\nmiserable at this ghost of an altercation, but I pushed past, mounted\nthe ladder, and in the expiring moonlight unstrapped that accursed\nportmanteau and, brimming over with irritation, groped among its\ncontents, sorting some into the skylight with the same feeling that\nnothing mattered much now, and it was best to be done with it;\nrepacking the rest with guilty stealth ere Davies should discover\ntheir character, and strapping up the whole again. Then I sat down\nupon my white elephant and shivered, for the chill of autumn was in\nthe air. It suddenly struck me that if it had been raining things\nmight have been worse still. The notion made me look round. The\nlittle cove was still as glass; stars above and stars below; a few\nwhite cottages glimmering at one point on the shore; in the west the\nlights of Flensburg; to the east the fiord broadening into unknown\ngloom. From Davies toiling below there were muffled sounds of\nwrenching, pushing, and hammering, punctuated occasionally by a heavy\nsplash as something shot up from the hatchway and fell into the\nwater.\n\nHow it came about I do not know. Whether it was something pathetic in\nthe look I had last seen on his face--a look which I associated for\nno reason whatever with his bandaged hand; whether it was one of\nthose instants of clear vision in which our separate selves are seen\ndivided, the baser from the better, and I saw my silly egotism in\ncontrast with a simple generous nature; whether it was an impalpable\nair of mystery which pervaded the whole enterprise and refused to be\ndissipated by its most mortifying and vulgarizing incidents--a\nmystery dimly connected with my companion's obvious consciousness of\nhaving misled me into joining him; whether it was only the stars and\nthe cool air rousing atrophied instincts of youth and spirits;\nprobably, indeed, it was all these influences, cemented into strength\nby a ruthless sense of humour which whispered that I was in danger of\nmaking a mere commonplace fool of myself in spite of all my laboured\ncalculations; but whatever it was, in a flash my mood changed. The\ncrown of martyrdom disappeared, the wounded vanity healed; that\nprecious fund of fictitious resignation drained away, but left no\nvoid. There was left a fashionable and dishevelled young man sitting\nin the dew and in the dark on a ridiculous portmanteau which dwarfed\nthe yacht that was to carry it; a youth acutely sensible of ignorance\nin a strange and strenuous atmosphere; still feeling sore and\nvictimized; but withal sanely ashamed and sanely resolved to enjoy\nhimself. I anticipate; for though the change was radical its full\ngrowth was slow. But in any case it was here and now that it took its\nbirth.\n\n'Grog's ready!' came from below. Bunching myself for the descent I\nfound to my astonishment that all trace of litter had miraculously\nvanished, and a cosy neatness reigned. Glasses and lemons were on the\ntable, and a fragrant smell of punch had deadened previous odours. I\nshowed little emotion at these amenities, but enough to give intense\nrelief to Davies, who delightedly showed me his devices for storage,\npraising the 'roominess' of his floating den. 'There's your stove,\nyou see,' he ended; 'I've chucked the old one overboard.' It was a\nweakness of his, I should say here, to rejoice in throwing things\noverboard on the flimsiest pretexts. I afterwards suspected that the\nnew stove had not been 'really necessary' any more than the\nrigging-screws, but was an excuse for gratifying this curious taste.\n\nWe smoked and chatted for a little, and then came the problem of\ngoing to bed. After much bumping of knuckles and head, and many giddy\nwrithings, I mastered it, and lay between the rough blankets. Davies,\nmoving swiftly and deftly, was soon in his.\n\n'It's quite comfortable, isn't it?' he said, as he blew out the light\nfrom where he lay, with an accuracy which must have been the fruit of\nlong practice.\n\nI felt prickly all over, and there was a damp patch on the pillow,\nwhich was soon explained by a heavy drop of moisture falling on my\nforehead.\n\n'I suppose the deck's not leaking?' I said, as mildly as I could.\n\n'I'm awfully sorry,' said Davies, earnestly, tumbling out of his\nbunk. 'It must be the heavy dew. I did a lot of caulking yesterday,\nbut I suppose I missed that place. I'll run up and square it with an\noilskin.'\n\n'What's wrong with your hand?' I asked, sleepily, on his return, for\ngratitude reminded me of that bandage.\n\n'Nothing much; I strained it the other day,' was the reply; and then\nthe seemingly inconsequent remark: 'I'm glad you brought that\nprismatic compass. It's not really necessary, of course; but'\n(muffled by blankets) 'it may come in useful.'\n\n\n\n\nIII. Davies\n\n\nI DOZED but fitfully, with a fretful sense of sore elbows and neck\nand many a draughty hiatus among the blankets. It was broad daylight\nbefore I had reached the stage of torpor in which such slumber\nmerges. That was finally broken by the descent through the skylight\nof a torrent of water. I started up, bumped my head hard against the\ndecks, and blinked leaden-eyed upwards.\n\n'Sorry! I'm scrubbing decks. Come up and bathe. Slept well?' I heard\na voice saying from aloft.\n\n'Fairly well,' I growled, stepping out into a pool of water on the\noilcloth. Thence I stumbled up the ladder, dived overboard, and\nburied bad dreams, stiffness, frowsiness, and tormented nerves in the\nloveliest fiord of the lovely Baltic. A short and furious swim and I\nwas back again, searching for a means of ascent up the smooth black\nside, which, low as it was, was slippery and unsympathetic. Davies,\nin a loose canvas shirt, with the sleeves tucked up, and flannels\nrolled up to the knee, hung over me with a rope's end, and chatted\nunconcernedly about the easiness of the job when you know how,\nadjuring me to mind the paint, and talking about an accommodation\nladder he had once had, but had thrown overboard because it was so\nhorribly in the way. When I arrived, my knees and elbows were picked\nout in black paint, to his consternation. Nevertheless, as I plied\nthe towel, I knew that I had left in those limpid depths yet another\ncrust of discontent and self-conceit.\n\nAs I dressed into flannels and blazer, I looked round the deck, and\nwith an unskilled and doubtful eye took in all that the darkness had\nhitherto hidden. She seemed very small (in point of fact she was\nseven tons), something over thirty feet in length and nine in beam, a\nsize very suitable to week-ends in the Solent, for such as liked that\nsort of thing; but that she should have come from Dover to the Baltic\nsuggested a world of physical endeavour of which I had never dreamed.\nI passed to the \u00c3\u00a6sthetic side. Smartness and beauty were essential\nto yachts, in my mind, but with the best resolves to be pleased I\nfound little encouragement here. The hull seemed too low, and the\nmainmast too high; the cabin roof looked clumsy, and the skylights\nsaddened the eye with dull iron and plebeian graining. What brass\nthere was, on the tiller-head and elsewhere, was tarnished with\nsickly green. The decks had none of that creamy purity which Cowes\nexpects, but were rough and grey, and showed tarry exhalations round\nthe seams and rusty stains near the bows. The ropes and rigging were\nin mourning when contrasted with the delicate buff manilla so\nsatisfying to the artistic eye as seen against the blue of a June sky\nat Southsea. Nor was the whole effect bettered by many signs of\nrecent refitting. An impression of paint, varnish, and carpentry was\nin the air; a gaudy new burgee fluttered aloft; there seemed to be a\nnew rope or two, especially round the diminutive mizzen-mast, which\nitself looked altogether new. But all this only emphasized the\ngeneral plainness, reminding one of a respectable woman of the\nworking-classes trying to dress above her station, and soon likely to\ngive it up.\n\nThat the _ensemble_ was businesslike and solid even my untrained eye\ncould see. Many of the deck fittings seemed disproportionately\nsubstantial. The anchor-chain looked contemptuous of its charge; the\nbinnacle with its compass was of a size and prominence almost\ncomically impressive, and was, moreover the only piece of brass which\nwas burnished and showed traces of reverent care. Two huge coils of\nstout and dingy warp lay just abaft the mainmast, and summed up the\nweather-beaten aspect of the little ship. I should add here that in\nthe distant past she had been a lifeboat, and had been clumsily\nconverted into a yacht by the addition of a counter, deck, and the\nnecessary spars. She was built, as all lifeboats are, diagonally, of\ntwo skins of teak, and thus had immense strength, though, in the\nmatter of looks, all a hybrid's failings.\n\nHunger and 'Tea's made!' from below brought me down to the cabin,\nwhere I found breakfast laid out on the table over the centreboard\ncase, with Davies earnestly presiding, rather flushed as to the face,\nand sooty as to the fingers. There was a slight shortage of plate and\ncrockery, but I praised the bacon and could do so truthfully, for its\ncrisp and steaming shavings would have put to shame the efforts of my\nLondon cook. Indeed, I should have enjoyed the meal heartily were it\nnot for the lowness of the sofa and table, causing a curvature of the\nbody which made swallowing a more lengthy process than usual, and\ninduced a periodical yearning to get up and stretch--a relief which\nspelt disaster to the skull. I noticed, too, that Davies spoke with a\nzest, sinister to me, of the delights of white bread and fresh milk,\nwhich he seemed to consider unusual luxuries, though suitable to an\ninaugural banquet in honour of a fastidious stranger. 'One can't be\nalways going on shore,' he said, when I showed a discreet interest in\nthese things. 'I lived for ten days on a big rye loaf over in the\nFrisian Islands.'\n\n'And it died hard, I suppose?'\n\n'Very hard, but' (gravely) 'quite good. After that I taught myself to\nmake rolls; had no baking powder at first, so used Eno's fruit salt,\nbut they wouldn't rise much with that. As for milk, condensed is--I\nhope you don't mind it?'\n\nI changed the subject, and asked about his plans.\n\n'Let's get under way at once,' he said, 'and sail down the fiord.' I\ntried for something more specific, but he was gone, and his voice\ndrowned in the fo'c'sle by the clatter and swish of washing up.\nThenceforward events moved with bewildering rapidity. Humbly desirous\nof being useful I joined him on deck, only to find that he scarcely\nnoticed me, save as a new and unexpected obstacle in his round of\nactivity. He was everywhere at once--heaving in chain, hooking on\nhalyards, hauling ropes; while my part became that of the clown who\ndoes things after they are already done, for my knowledge of a yacht\nwas of that floating and inaccurate kind which is useless in\npractice. Soon the anchor was up (a great rusty monster it was!), the\nsails set, and Davies was darting swiftly to and fro between the\ntiller and jib-sheets, while the _Dulcibella_ bowed a lingering\nfarewell to the shore and headed for the open fiord. Erratic puffs\nfrom the high land behind made her progress timorous at first, but\nsoon the fairway was reached and a true breeze from Flensburg and the\nwest took her in its friendly grip. Steadily she rustled down the\ncalm blue highway whose soft beauty was the introduction to a passage\nin my life, short, but pregnant with moulding force, through stress\nand strain, for me and others.\n\nDavies was gradually resuming his natural self, with abstracted\nintervals, in which he lashed the helm to finger a distant rope, with\nsuch speed that the movements seemed simultaneous. Once he vanished,\nonly to reappear in an instant with a chart, which he studied, while\nsteering, with a success that its reluctant folds seemed to render\nimpossible. Waiting respectfully for his revival I had full time to\nlook about. The fiord here was about a mile broad. From the shore we\nhad left the hills rose steeply, but with no rugged grandeur; the\noutlines were soft; there were green spaces and rich woods on the\nlower slopes; a little white town was opening up in one place, and\nscattered farms dotted the prospect. The other shore, which I could\njust see, framed between the gunwale and the mainsail, as I sat\nleaning against the hatchway, and sadly missing a deck-chair, was\nlower and lonelier, though prosperous and pleasing to the eye.\nSpacious pastures led up by slow degrees to ordered clusters of wood,\nwhich hinted at the presence of some great manor house. Behind us,\nFlensburg was settling into haze. Ahead, the scene was shut in by the\ncontours of hills, some clear, some dreamy and distant. Lastly, a\nsingle glimpse of water shining between the folds of hill far away\nhinted at spaces of distant sea of which this was but a secluded\ninlet. Everywhere was that peculiar charm engendered by the\nassociation of quiet pastoral country and a homely human atmosphere\nwith a branch of the great ocean that bathes all the shores of our\nglobe.\n\nThere was another charm in the scene, due to the way in which I was\nviewing it--not as a pampered passenger on a 'fine steam yacht', or\neven on 'a powerful modern schooner', as the yacht agents advertise,\nbut from the deck of a scrubby little craft of doubtful build and\ndistressing plainness, which yet had smelt her persistent way to this\ndistant fiord through I knew not what of difficulty and danger, with\nno apparent motive in her single occupant, who talked as vaguely and\nunconcernedly about his adventurous cruise as though it were all a\nprotracted afternoon on Southampton Water.\n\nI glanced round at Davies. He had dropped the chart and was sitting,\nor rather half lying, on the deck with one bronzed arm over the\ntiller, gazing fixedly ahead, with just an occasional glance around\nand aloft. He still seemed absorbed in himself, and for a moment or\ntwo I studied his face with an attention I had never, since I had\nknown him, given it. I had always thought it commonplace, as I had\nthought him commonplace, so far as I had thought at all about either.\nIt had always rather irritated me by an excess of candour and\nboyishness. These qualities it had kept, but the scales were falling\nfrom my eyes, and I saw others. I saw strength to obstinacy and\ncourage to recklessness, in the firm lines of the chin; an older and\ndeeper look in the eyes. Those odd transitions from bright mobility\nto detached earnestness, which had partly amused and chiefly annoyed\nme hitherto, seemed now to be lost in a sensitive reserve, not cold\nor egotistic, but strangely winning from its paradoxical frankness.\nSincerity was stamped on every lineament. A deep misgiving stirred me\nthat, clever as I thought myself, nicely perceptive of the right and\ncongenial men to know, I had made some big mistakes--how many, I\nwondered? A relief, scarcely less deep because it was unconfessed,\nstole in on me with the suspicion that, little as I deserved it, the\npatient fates were offering me a golden chance of repairing at least\none. And yet, I mused, the patient fates have crooked methods,\nbesides a certain mischievous humour, for it was Davies who had asked\nme out--though now he scarcely seemed to need me--almost tricked me\ninto coming out, for he might have known I was not suited to such a\nlife; yet trickery and Davies sounded an odd conjuncture.\n\nProbably it was the growing discomfort of my attitude which produced\nthis backsliding. My night's rest and the 'ascent from the bath' had,\nin fact, done little to prepare me for contact with sharp edges and\nhard surfaces. But Davies had suddenly come to himself, and with an\n'I say, are you comfortable? Have something to sit on?' jerked the\nhelm a little to windward, felt it like a pulse for a moment, with a\nrapid look to windward, and dived below, whence he returned with a\ncouple of cushions, which he threw to me. I felt perversely resentful\nof these luxuries, and asked:\n\n'Can't I be of any use?'\n\n'Oh, don't you bother,' he answered. 'I expect you're tired. Aren't\nwe having a splendid sail? That must be Ekken on the port bow,'\npeering under the sail, 'where the trees run in. I say, do you mind\nlooking at the chart?' He tossed it over to me. I spread it out\npainfully, for it curled up like a watch-spring at the least\nslackening of pressure. I was not familiar with charts, and this\nsudden trust reposed in me, after a good deal of neglect, made me\nnervous.\n\n'You see Flensburg, don't you?' he said. 'That's where we are,'\ndabbing with a long reach at an indefinite space on the crowded\nsheet. 'Now which side of that buoy off the point do we pass?'\n\nI had scarcely taken in which was land and which was water, much less\nthe significance of the buoy, when he resumed:\n\n'Never mind; I'm pretty sure it's all deep water about here. I expect\nthat marks the fairway for steamers.\n\nIn a minute or two we were passing the buoy in question, on the wrong\nside I am pretty certain, for weeds and sand came suddenly into view\nbelow us with uncomfortable distinctness. But all Davies said was:\n\n'There's never any sea here, and the plate's not down,' a dark\nutterance which I pondered doubtfully. 'The best of these Schleswig\nwaters,' he went on, 'is that a boat of this size can go almost\nanywhere. There's no navigation required. Why----' At this moment a\nfaint scraping was felt, rather than heard, beneath us.\n\n'Aren't we aground?' I asked with great calmness.\n\n'Oh, she'll blow over,' he replied, wincing a little.\n\nShe 'blew over', but the episode caused a little na\u00c3\u00afve vexation in\nDavies. I relate it as a good instance of one of his minor\npeculiarities. He was utterly without that didactic pedantry which\nyachting has a fatal tendency to engender in men who profess it. He\nhad tossed me the chart without a thought that I was an ignoramus, to\nwhom it would be Greek, and who would provide him with an admirable\nsubject to drill and lecture, just as his neglect of me throughout\nthe morning had been merely habitual and unconscious independence. In\nthe second place, master of his _m\u00c3\u00a9tier_, as I knew him afterwards to\nbe, resourceful, skilful, and alert, he was liable to lapse into a\ncertain amateurish vagueness, half irritating and half amusing. I\nthink truly that both these peculiarities came from the same source,\na hatred of any sort of affectation. To the same source I traced the\nfact that he and his yacht observed none of the superficial etiquette\nof yachts and yachtsmen, that she never, for instance, flew a\nnational ensign, and he never wore a 'yachting suit'.\n\nWe rounded a low green point which I had scarcely noticed before.\n\n'We must jibe,' said Davies: 'just take the helm, will you?' and,\nwithout waiting for my co-operation, he began hauling in the\nmainsheet with great vigour. I had rude notions of steering, but\njibing is a delicate operation. No yachtsman will be surprised to\nhear that the boom saw its opportunity and swung over with a mighty\ncrash, with the mainsheet entangled round me and the tiller.\n\n'Jibed all standing,' was his sorrowful comment. 'You're not used to\nher yet. She's very quick on the helm.'\n\n'Where am I to steer for?' I asked, wildly.\n\n'Oh, don't trouble, I'll take her now,' he replied.\n\nI felt it was time to make my position clear. 'I'm an utter duffer at\nsailing,' I began. 'You'll have a lot to teach me, or one of these\ndays I shall be wrecking you. You see, there's always been a\ncrew----'\n\n'Crew!'--with sovereign contempt--'why, the whole fun of the\nthing is to do everything oneself.'\n\n'Well, I've felt in the way the whole morning.'\n\n'I'm awfully sorry!' His dismay and repentance were comical. 'Why,\nit's just the other way; you may be all the use in the world.' He\nbecame absent.\n\nWe were following the inward trend of a small bay towards a cleft in\nthe low shore.\n\n'That's Ekken Sound,' said Davies; 'let's look into it,' and a minute\nor two later we were drifting through a dainty little strait, with a\npeep of open water at the end of it. Cottages bordered either side,\nsome overhanging the very water, some connecting with it by a rickety\nwooden staircase or a miniature landing-stage. Creepers and roses\nrioted over the walls and tiny porches. For a space on one side, a\nrude quay, with small smacks floating off it, spoke of some minute\ncommercial interests; a very small tea-garden, with neglected-looking\nbowers and leaf-strewn tables, hinted at some equally minute tripping\ninterest. A pervading hue of mingled bronze and rose came partly from\nthe weather-mellowed woodwork of the cottages and stages, and partly\nfrom the creepers and the trees behind, where autumn's subtle fingers\nwere already at work. Down this exquisite sea-lane we glided till it\nended in a broad mere, where our sails, which had been shivering and\ncomplaining, filled into contented silence.\n\n'Ready about!' said Davies, callously. 'We must get out of this\nagain.' And round we swung.\n\n'Why not anchor and stop here?' I protested; for a view of\ntantalizing loveliness was unfolding itself.\n\n'Oh, we've seen all there is to be seen, and we must take this breeze\nwhile we've got it.' It was always torture to Davies to feel a good\nbreeze running to waste while he was inactive at anchor or on shore.\nThe 'shore' to him was an inferior element, merely serving as a\nuseful annexe to the water--a source of necessary supplies.\n\n'Let's have lunch,' he pursued, as we resumed our way down the fiord.\nA vision of iced drinks, tempting salads, white napery, and an\nattentive steward mocked me with past recollections.\n\n'You'll find a tongue,' said the voice of doom, 'in the starboard\nsofa-locker; beer under the floor in the bilge. I'll see her round\nthat buoy, if you wouldn't mind beginning.' I obeyed with a bad\ngrace, but the close air and cramped posture must have benumbed my\nfaculties, for I opened the port-side locker, reached down, and\ngrasped a sticky body, which turned out to be a pot of varnish.\nRecoiling wretchedly, I tried the opposite one, combating the\nembarrassing heel of the boat and the obstructive edges of the\ncentreboard case. A medley of damp tins of varied sizes showed in\nthe gloom, exuding a mouldy odour. Faded legends on dissolving paper,\nlike the remnants of old posters on a disused hoarding, spoke of\nsoups, curries, beefs, potted meats, and other hidden delicacies. I\npicked out a tongue, re-imprisoned the odour, and explored for beer.\nIt was true, I supposed, that bilge didn't hurt it, as I tugged at\nthe plank on my hands and knees, but I should have myself preferred a\nmore accessible and less humid wine-cellar than the cavities among\nslimy ballast from which I dug the bottles. I regarded my hard-won\nand ill-favoured pledges of a meal with giddiness and discouragement.\n\n'How are you getting on?' shouted Davies; 'the tin-opener's hanging\nup on the bulkhead; the plates and knives are in the cupboard.'\n\nI doggedly pursued my functions. The plates and knives met me\nhalf-way, for, being on the weather side, and thus having a downward\nslant, its contents, when I slipped the latch, slid affectionately\ninto my bosom, and overflowed with a clatter and jingle on to the\nfloor.\n\n'That often happens,' I heard from above. 'Never mind! There are no\nbreakables. I'm coming down to help.' And down he came, leaving the\n_Dulcibella_ to her own devices.\n\n'I think I'll go on deck,' I said. 'Why in the world couldn't you\nlunch comfortably at Ekken and save this infernal pandemonium of a\npicnic? Where's the yacht going to meanwhile? And how are we to lunch\non that slanting table? I'm covered with varnish and mud, and\nankle-deep in crockery. There goes the beer!'\n\n'You shouldn't have stood it on the table with this list on,' said\nDavies, with intense composure, 'but it won't do any harm; it'll\ndrain into the bilge' (ashes to ashes, dust to dust, I thought). 'You\ngo on deck now, and I'll finish getting ready.' I regretted my\nexplosion, though wrung from me under great provocation.\n\n'Keep her straight on as she's going,' said Davies, as I clambered up\nout of the chaos, brushing the dust off my trousers and varnishing\nthe ladder with my hands. I unlashed the helm and kept her as she was\ngoing.\n\nWe had rounded a sharp bend in the fiord, and were sailing up a broad\nand straight reach which every moment disclosed new beauties, sights\nfair enough to be balm to the angriest spirit. A red-roofed hamlet\nwas on our left, on the right an ivied ruin, close to the water,\nwhere some contemplative cattle stood knee-deep. The view ahead was a\nwhite strand which fringed both shores, and to it fell wooded slopes,\ninterrupted here and there by low sandstone cliffs of warm red\ncolouring, and now and again by a dingle with cracks of greensward.\n\nI forgot petty squalors and enjoyed things--the coy tremble of the\ntiller and the backwash of air from the dingy mainsail, and, with a\nsomewhat chastened rapture, the lunch which Davies brought up to me\nand solicitously watched me eat.\n\nLater, as the wind sank to lazy airs, he became busy with a larger\ntopsail and jib; but I was content to doze away the afternoon,\ndrenching brain and body in the sweet and novel foreign atmosphere,\nand dreamily watching the fringe of glen cliff and cool white sand as\nthey passed ever more slowly by.\n\n\n\n\nIV. Retrospect\n\n\n'WAKE up!' I rubbed my eyes and wondered where I was; stretched\nmyself painfully, too, for even the cushions had not given me a true\nbed of roses. It was dusk, and the yacht was stationary in glassy\nwater, coloured by the last after-glow. A roofing of thin upper-cloud\nhad spread over most of the sky, and a subtle smell of rain was in\nthe air. We seemed to be in the middle of the fiord, whose shores\nlooked distant and steep in the gathering darkness. Close ahead they\nfaded away suddenly, and the sight lost itself in a grey void. The\nstillness was absolute.\n\n'We can't get to Sonderburg to-night,' said Davies.\n\n'What's to be done then?' I asked, collecting my senses.\n\n'Oh! we'll anchor anywhere here, we're just at the mouth of the\nfiord; I'll tow her inshore if you'll steer in that direction.' He\npointed vaguely at a blur of trees and cliff. Then he jumped into the\ndinghy, cast off the painter, and, after snatching at the slack of a\nrope, began towing the reluctant yacht by short jerks of the sculls.\nThe menacing aspect of that grey void, combined with a natural\npreference for getting to some definite place at night, combined to\ndepress my spirits afresh. In my sleep I had dreamt of Morven Lodge,\nof heather tea-parties after glorious slaughters of grouse, of salmon\nleaping in amber pools--and now----\n\n'Just take a cast of the lead, will you?' came Davies's voice above\nthe splash of the sculls.\n\n'Where is it?' I shouted back.\n\n'Never mind--we're close enough now; let---- Can you manage to let go\nthe anchor?'\n\nI hurried forward and picked impotently at the bonds of the sleeping\nmonster. But Davies was aboard again, and stirred him with a deft\ntouch or two, till he crashed into the water with a grinding of\nchain.\n\n'We shall do well here,' said he.\n\n'Isn't this rather an open anchorage?' I suggested.\n\n'It's only open from that quarter,' he replied. 'If it comes on to\nblow from there we shall have to clear out; but I think it's only\nrain. Let's stow the sails.'\n\nAnother whirlwind of activity, in which I joined as effectively as I\ncould, oppressed by the prospect of having to 'clear out'--who knows\nwhither?--at midnight. But Davies's _sang froid_ was infectious, I\nsuppose, and the little den below, bright-lit and soon fragrant with\ncookery, pleaded insistently for affection. Yachting in this singular\nstyle was hungry work, I found. Steak tastes none the worse for\nhaving been wrapped in newspaper, and the slight traces of the day's\nnews disappear with frying in onions and potato-chips. Davies was\nindeed on his mettle for this, his first dinner to his guest; for he\nproduced with stealthy pride, not from the dishonoured grave of the\nbeer, but from some more hallowed recess, a bottle of German\nchampagne, from which we drank success to the _Dulcibella_.\n\n'I wish you would tell me all about your cruise from England,' I\nasked. 'You must have had some exciting adventures. Here are the\ncharts; let's go over them.'\n\n'We must wash up first,' he replied, and I was tactfully introduced\nto one of his very few 'standing orders', that tobacco should not\nburn, nor post-prandial chat begin, until that distasteful process\nhad ended. 'It would never get done otherwise,' he sagely opined. But\nwhen we were finally settled with cigars, a variety of which, culled\nfrom many ports--German, Dutch, and Belgian--Davies kept in a\nbattered old box in the net-rack, the promised talk hung fire.\n\n'I'm no good at description,' he complained; 'and there's really very\nlittle to tell. We left Dover--Morrison and I--on the 6th of August; made a\ngood passage to Ostend.'\n\n'You had some fun there, I suppose?' I put in, thinking of--well, of\nOstend in August.\n\n'Fun! A filthy hole I call it; we had to stop a couple of days, as we\nfouled a buoy coming in and carried away the bobstay; we lay in a\ndirty little tidal dock, and there was nothing to do on shore.'\n\n'Well, what next?'\n\n'We had a splendid sail to the East Scheldt, but then, like fools,\ndecided to go through Holland by canal and river. It was good fun\nenough navigating the estuary--the tides and banks there are\nappalling--but farther inland it was a wretched business, nothing but\npaying lock-dues, bumping against schuyts, and towing down stinking\ncanals. Never a peaceful night like this--always moored by some quay\nor tow-path, with people passing and boys. Heavens! shall I ever\nforget those boys! A perfect murrain of them infests Holland; they\nseem to have nothing in the world to do but throw stones and mud at\nforeign yachts.'\n\n'They want a Herod, with some statesmanlike views on infanticide.'\n\n'By Jove! yes; but the fact is that you want a crew for that\npottering inland work; they can smack the boys and keep an eye on the\nsculls. A boat like this should stick to the sea, or out-of-the-way\nplaces on the coast. Well, after Amsterdam.'\n\n'You've skipped a good deal, haven't you?' I interrupted.\n\n'Oh! have I? Well, let me see, we went by Dordrecht to Rotterdam;\nnothing to see there, and swarms of tugs buzzing about and shaving\none's bows every second. On by the Vecht river to Amsterdam, and\nthence--Lord, what a relief it was!--out into the North Sea again.\nThe weather had been still and steamy; but it broke up finely now,\nand we had a rattling three-reef sail to the Zuyder Zee.'\n\nHe reached up to the bookshelf for what looked like an ancient\nledger, and turned over the leaves.\n\n'Is that your log?' I asked. 'I should like to have a look at it.'\n\n'Oh! you'd find it dull reading--if you could read it at all; it's\njust short notes about winds and bearings, and so on.' He was turning\nsome leaves over rapidly. 'Now, why don't you keep a log of what we\ndo? I can't describe things, and you can.'\n\n'I've half a mind to try,' I said.\n\n'We want another chart now,' and he pulled down a second yet more\nstained and frayed than the first. 'We had a splendid time then\nexploring the Zuyder Zee, its northern part at least, and round those\nislands which bound it on the north. Those are the Frisian Islands,\nand they stretch for 120 miles or so eastward. You see, the first two\nof them, Texel and Vlieland, shut in the Zuyder Zee, and the rest\nborder the Dutch and German coasts.' _[See Map A]_\n\n'What's all this?' I said, running my finger over some dotted patches\nwhich covered much of the chart. The latter was becoming\nunintelligible; clean-cut coasts and neat regiments of little figures\nhad given place to a confusion of winding and intersecting lines and\nbald spaces.\n\n'All _sand,_' said Davies, enthusiastically. 'You can't think what a\nsplendid sailing-ground it is. You can explore for days without\nseeing a soul. These are the channels, you see; they're very badly\ncharted. This chart was almost useless, but it made it all the more\nfun. No towns or harbours, just a village or two on the islands, if\nyou wanted stores.'\n\n'They look rather desolate,' I said.\n\n'Desolate's no word for it; they're really only gigantic sandbanks\nthemselves.'\n\n'Wasn't all this rather dangerous?' I asked.\n\n'Not a bit; you see, that's where our shallow draught and flat bottom\ncame in--we could go anywhere, and it didn't matter running\naground--she's perfect for that sort of work; and she doesn't really\n_look_ bad either, does she?' he asked, rather wistfully. I suppose I\nhesitated, for he said, abruptly:\n\n'Anyway, I don't go in for looks.'\n\nHe had leaned back, and I detected traces of incipient\nabsentmindedness. His cigar, which he had lately been lighting and\nrelighting feverishly--a habit of his when excited--seemed now to\nhave expired for good.\n\n'About running aground,' I persisted; 'surely that's apt to be\ndangerous?'\n\nHe sat up and felt round for a match.\n\n'Not the least, if you know where you can run risks and where you\ncan't; anyway, you can't possibly help it. That chart may look simple\nto you'--('simple!' I thought)--'but at half flood all those banks\nare covered; the islands and coasts are scarcely visible, they are so\nlow, and everything looks the same.' This graphic description of a\n'splendid cruising-ground' took away my breath. 'Of course there _is_\nrisk sometimes--choosing an anchorage requires care. You can\ngenerally get a nice berth under the lee of a bank, but the tides run\nstrong in the channels, and if there's a gale blowing----'\n\n'Didn't you ever take a pilot?' I interrupted.\n\n'Pilot? Why, the whole point of the thing'--he stopped short--'I did\ntake one once, later on,' he resumed, with an odd smile, which faded\nat once.\n\n'Well?' I urged, for I saw a reverie was coming.\n\n'Oh! he ran me ashore, of course. Served me right. I wonder what the\nweather's doing'; he rose, glanced at the aneroid, the clock, and the\nhalf-closed skylight with a curious circular movement, and went a\nstep or two up the companion-ladder, where he remained for several\nminutes with head and shoulders in the open air.\n\nThere was no sound of wind outside, but the _Dulcibella_ had begun to\nmove in her sleep, as it were, rolling drowsily to some faint send of\nthe sea, with an occasional short jump, like the start of an uneasy\ndreamer.\n\n'What does it look like?' I called from my sofa. I had to repeat the\nquestion.\n\n'Rain coming,' said Davies, returning, 'and possibly wind; but we're\nsafe enough here. It's coming from the sou'-west; shall we turn in?'\n\n'We haven't finished your cruise yet,' I said. 'Light a pipe and tell\nme the rest.'\n\n'All right,' he agreed, with more readiness than I expected.\n\n'After Terschelling--here it is, the third island from the west--I\npottered along eastward.' _[See Map A]_\n\n'I?'\n\n'Oh! I forgot. Morrison had to leave me there. I missed him badly,\nbut I hoped at that time to get ---- to join me. I could manage all right\nsingle-handed, but for that sort of work two are much better than\none. The plate's beastly heavy; in fact, I had to give up using it\nfor fear of a smash.'\n\n'After Terschelling?' I jogged his memory.\n\n'Well, I followed the Dutch islands, Ameland, Schiermonnikoog, Rottum\n(outlandish names, aren't they?), sometimes outside them, sometimes\ninside. It was a bit lonely, but grand sport and very interesting.\nThe charts were shocking, but I worried out most of the channels.'\n\n'I suppose those waters are only used by small local craft?' I put\nin; 'that would account for inaccuracies.' Did Davies think that\nAdmiralties had time to waste on smoothing the road for such quixotic\nlittle craft as his, in all its inquisitive ramblings? But he fired\nup.\n\n'That's all very well,' he said, 'but think what folly it is.\nHowever, that's a long story, and will bore you. To cut matters\nshort, for we ought to be turning in, I got to Borkum--that's the\nfirst of the _German_ islands.' He pointed at a round bare lozenge\nlying in the midst of a welter of sandbanks. 'Rottum--this queer\nlittle one--it has only one house on it--is the most easterly Dutch\nisland, and the mainland of Holland ends _here_, opposite it, at the\nEms River'--indicating a dismal cavity in the coast, sown with names\nsuggestive of mud, and wrecks, and dreariness.\n\n'What date was this?' I asked.\n\n'About the ninth of this month.'\n\n'Why, that's only a fortnight before you wired to me! You were pretty\nquick getting to Flensburg. Wait a bit, we want another chart. Is\nthis the next?'\n\n'Yes; but we scarcely need it. I only went a little way farther\non--to Norderney, in fact, the third German island--then I decided to\ngo straight for the Baltic. I had always had an idea of getting\nthere, as Knight did in the _Falcon_. So I made a passage of it to the\nEider River, _there_ on the West Schleswig coast, took the river and\ncanal through to Kiel on the Baltic, and from there made another\npassage up north to Flensburg. I was a week there, and then you came,\nand here we are. And now let's turn in. We'll have a fine sail\nto-morrow!' He ended with rather forced vivacity, and briskly rolled\nup the chart. The reluctance he had shown from the first to talk\nabout his cruise had been for a brief space forgotten in his\nenthusiasm about a portion of it, but had returned markedly in this\nbald conclusion. I felt sure that there was more in it than mere\ndisinclination to spin nautical yarns in the 'hardy Corinthian'\nstyle, which can be so offensive in amateur yachtsmen; and I thought\nI guessed the explanation. His voyage single-handed to the Baltic\nfrom the Frisian Islands had been a foolhardy enterprise, with\nperilous incidents, which, rather than make light of, he would not\nrefer to at all. Probably he was ashamed of his recklessness and\nwished to ignore it with me, an inexperienced acquaintance not yet\nenamoured of the _Dulcibella_s' way of life, whom both courtesy and\ninterest demanded that he should inspire with confidence. I liked him\nall the better as I came to this conclusion, but I was tempted to\npersist a little.\n\n'I slept the whole afternoon,' I said; 'and, to tell the truth, I\nrather dread the idea of going to bed, it's so tiring. Look here,\nyou've rushed over that last part like an express train. That passage\nto the Schleswig coast--the Eider River, did you say?--was a longish\none, wasn't it?'\n\n'Well, you see what it was; about seventy miles, I suppose, direct.'\nHe spoke low, bending down to sweep up some cigar ashes on the floor.\n\n'Direct?' I insinuated. 'Then you put in somewhere?'\n\n'I stopped once, anchored for the night; oh, that's nothing of a sail\nwith a fair wind. By Jove! I've forgotten to caulk that seam over\nyour bunk, and it's going to rain. I must do it now. You turn in.'\n\nHe disappeared. My curiosity, never very consuming, was banished by\nconcern as to the open seam; for the prospect of a big drop,\nremorseless and regular as Fate, falling on my forehead throughout\nthe night, as in the torture-chamber of the Inquisition, was alarming\nenough to recall me wholly to the immediate future. So I went to bed,\nfinding on the whole that I had made progress in the exercise, though\nstill far from being the trained contortionist that the occasion\ncalled for. Hammering ceased, and Davies reappeared just as I was\nstretched on the rack--tucked up in my bunk, I mean.\n\n'I say,' he said, when he was settled in his, and darkness reigned,\n'do you think you'll like this sort of thing?'\n\n'If there are many places about here as beautiful as this,' I\nreplied, 'I think I shall. But I should like to land now and then and\nhave a walk. Of course, a great deal depends on the weather, doesn't\nit? I hope this rain' (drops had begun to patter overhead) 'doesn't\nmean that the summer's over for good.'\n\n'Oh, you can sail just the same,' said Davies, 'unless it's very bad.\nThere's plenty of sheltered water. There's bound to be a change soon.\nBut then there are the ducks. The colder and stormier it is, the\nbetter for them.'\n\nI had forgotten the ducks and the cold, and, suddenly presented as a\nshooting-box in inclement weather, the _Dulcibella_ lost ground in my\nestimation, which she had latterly gained.\n\n'I'm fond of shooting,' I said, 'but I'm afraid I'm only a\nfair-weather yachtsman, and I should much prefer sun and scenery.'\n\n'Scenery,' he repeated, reflectively. 'I say, you must have thought\nit a queer taste of mine to cruise about on that outlandish Frisian\ncoast. How would you like that sort of thing?'\n\n'I should loathe it,' I answered, promptly, with a clear conscience.\n'Weren't you delighted yourself to get to the Baltic? It must be a\nwonderful contrast to what you described. Did you ever see another\nyacht there?'\n\n'Only one,' he answered. 'Good night!'\n\n'Good night!'\n\n\n\n\nV. Wanted, a North Wind\n\n\nNOTHING disturbed my rest that night, so adaptable is youth and so\nmasterful is nature. At times I was remotely aware of a threshing of\nrain and a humming of wind, with a nervous kicking of the little\nhull, and at one moment I dreamt I saw an apparition by candle-light\nof Davies, clad in pyjamas and huge top-boots, grasping a misty\nlantern of gigantic proportions. But the apparition mounted the\nladder and disappeared, and I passed to other dreams.\n\nA blast in my ear, like the voice of fifty trombones, galvanized me\ninto full consciousness. The musician, smiling and tousled, was at my\nbedside, raising a foghorn to his lips with deadly intention. 'It's a\nway we have in the _Dulcibella_,' he said, as I started up on one\nelbow. 'I didn't startle you much, did I?' he added.\n\n'Well, I like the _mattinata_ better than the cold douche,' I\nanswered, thinking of yesterday.\n\n'Fine day and magnificent breeze!' he answered. My sensations this\nmorning were vastly livelier than those of yesterday at the same\nhour. My limbs were supple again and my head clear. Not even the\nsearching wind could mar the ecstasy of that plunge down to smooth,\nseductive sand, where I buried greedy fingers and looked through a\nmedium blue, with that translucent blue, fairy-faint and angel-pure,\nthat you see in perfection only in the heart of ice. Up again to sun,\nwind, and the forest whispers from the shore; down just once more to\nsee the uncouth anchor stabbing the sand's soft bosom with one rusty\nfang, deaf and inert to the _Dulcibella_s' puny efforts to drag him\nfrom his prey. Back, holding by the cable as a rusty clue from heaven\nto earth, up to that _bourgeoise_ little maiden's bows; back to\nbreakfast, with an appetite not to be blunted by condensed milk and\nsomewhat _pass\u00c3\u00a9_ bread. An hour later we had dressed the _Dulcibella_\nfor the road, and were foaming into the grey void of yesterday, now a\nnoble expanse of wind-whipped blue, half surrounded by distant hills,\ntheir every outline vivid in the rain-washed air.\n\nI cannot pretend that I really enjoyed this first sail into the open,\nthough I was keenly anxious to do so. I felt the thrill of those\nforward leaps, heard that persuasive song the foam sings under the\nlee-bow, saw the flashing harmonies of sea and sky; but sensuous\nperception was deadened by nervousness. The yacht looked smaller than\never outside the quiet fiord. The song of the foam seemed very near,\nthe wave crests aft very high. The novice in sailing clings\ndesperately to the thoughts of sailors--effective, prudent persons,\nwith a typical jargon and a typical dress, versed in local currents\nand winds. I could not help missing this professional element.\nDavies, as he sat grasping his beloved tiller, looked strikingly\nefficient in his way, and supremely at home in his surroundings; but\nhe looked the amateur through and through, as with one hand, and (it\nseemed) one eye, he wrestled with a spray-splashed chart half\nunrolled on the deck beside him. All his casual ways returned to\nme--his casual talk and that last adventurous voyage to the Baltic,\nand the suspicions his reticence had aroused.\n\n'Do you see a monument anywhere?' he said, all at once; and, before I\ncould answer; 'We must take another reef.' He let go of the tiller\nand relit his pipe, while the yacht rounded sharply to, and in a\ntwinkling was tossing head to sea with loud claps of her canvas and\npassionate jerks of her boom, as the wind leapt on its quarry, now\nturning to bay, with redoubled force. The sting of spray in my eyes\nand the Babel of noise dazed me; but Davies, with a pull on the\nfore-sheet, soothed the tormented little ship, and left her coolly\nsparring with the waves while he shortened sail and puffed his pipe.\nAn hour later the narrow vista of Als Sound was visible, with quiet\nold Sonderburg sunning itself on the island shore, and the Dybbol\nheights towering above--the Dybbol of bloody memory; scene of the\nlast desperate stand of the Danes in '64, ere the Prussians wrested\nthe two fair provinces from them.\n\n'It's early to anchor, and I hate towns,' said Davies, as one section\nof a lumbering pontoon bridge opened to give us passage. But I was\nfirm on the need for a walk, and got my way on condition that I\nbought stores as well, and returned in time to admit of further\nadvance to a 'quiet anchorage'. Never did I step on the solid earth\nwith stranger feelings, partly due to relief from confinement, partly\nto that sense of independence in travelling, which, for those who go\ndown to the sea in small ships, can make the foulest coal-port in\nNorthumbria seem attractive. And here I had fascinating Sonderburg,\nwith its broad-eaved houses of carved woodwork, each fresh with\ncleansing, yet reverend with age; its fair-haired Viking-like men,\nand rosy, plain-faced women, with their bullet foreheads and large\nmouths; Sonderburg still Danish to the core under its Teuton veneer.\nCrossing the bridge I climbed the Dybbol--dotted with memorials of\nthat heroic defence--and thence could see the wee form and gossamer\nrigging of the _Dulcibella_ on the silver ribbon of the Sound, and was\nreminded by the sight that there were stores to be bought. So I\nhurried down again to the old quarter and bargained over eggs and\nbread with a dear old lady, pink as a _d\u00c3\u00a9butante,_ made a patriotic\npretence of not understanding German, and called in her strapping\nson, whose few words of English, being chiefly nautical slang picked\nup on a British trawler, were peculiarly useless for the purpose.\nDavies had tea ready when I came aboard again, and, drinking it on\ndeck, we proceeded up the sheltered Sound, which, in spite of its\nimposing name, was no bigger than an inland river, only the hosts of\nrainbow jelly-fish reminding us that we were threading a highway of\nocean. There is no rise and fall of tide in these regions to\ndisfigure the shore with mud. Here was a shelving gravel bank; there\na bed of whispering rushes; there again young birch trees growing to\nthe very brink, each wearing a stocking of bright moss and setting\nits foot firmly in among golden leaves and scarlet fungus.\n\nDavies was preoccupied, but he lighted up when I talked of the Danish\nwar. 'Germany's a thundering great nation,' he said; 'I wonder if we\nshall ever fight her.' A little incident that happened after we\nanchored deepened the impression left by this conversation. We crept\nat dusk into a shaded back-water, where our keel almost touched the\ngravel bed. Opposite us on the Alsen shore there showed, clean-cut\nagainst the sky, the spire of a little monument rising from a leafy\nhollow.\n\n'I wonder what that is,' I said. It was scarcely a minute's row in\nthe dinghy, and when the anchor was down we sculled over to it. A\nbank of loam led to gorse and bramble. Pushing aside some branches we\ncame to a slender Gothic memorial in grey stone, inscribed with\nbas-reliefs of battle scenes, showing Prussians forcing a landing in\nboats and Danes resisting with savage tenacity. In the failing light\nwe spelt out an inscription: 'Den bei dem Meeres Uebergange und der\nEroberung von Alsen am 29. Juni 1864 heldenm\u00c3\u00bcthig gefallenen zum\nehrenden Ged\u00c3\u00a4chtniss.' 'To the honoured memory of those who died\nheroically at the invasion and storming of Alsen.' I knew the German\npassion for commemoration; I had seen similar memorials on Alsatian\nbattlefields, and several on the Dybbol only that afternoon; but\nthere was something in the scene, the hour, and the circumstances,\nwhich made this one seem singularly touching. As for Davies, I\nscarcely recognized him; his eyes flashed and filled with tears as he\nglanced from the inscription to the path we had followed and the\nwater beyond. 'It was a landing in boats, I suppose,' he said, half\nto himself. 'I wonder they managed it. What does _heldenm\u00c3\u00bcthig_\nmean?'--'Heroically.'--'Heldenm\u00c3\u00bcthig gefallenen,' he repeated, under\nhis breath, lingering on each syllable. He was like a schoolboy\nreading of Waterloo.\n\nOur conversation at dinner turned naturally on war, and in naval\nwarfare I found I had come upon Davies's literary hobby. I had not\nhitherto paid attention to the medley on our bookshelf, but I now saw\nthat, besides a Nautical Almanack and some dilapidated _Sailing\nDirections_, there were several books on the cruises of small yachts,\nand also some big volumes crushed in anyhow or lying on the top.\nSquinting painfully at them I saw Mahan's _Life of Nelson_, Brassey's\n_Naval Annual_, and others.\n\n'It's a tremendously interesting subject,' said Davies, pulling down\n(in two pieces) a volume of Mahan's _Influence of Sea Power_.\n\nDinner flagged (and froze) while he illustrated a point by reference\nto the much-thumbed pages. He was very keen, and not very articulate.\nI knew just enough to be an intelligent listener, and, though hungry,\nwas delighted to hear him talk.\n\n'I'm not boring you, am I?' he said, suddenly.\n\n'I should think not,' I protested. 'But you might just have a look at\nthe chops.'\n\nThey had indeed been crying aloud for notice for some minutes, and\ndrew candid attention to their neglect when they appeared. The\ndiversion they caused put Davies out of vein. I tried to revive the\nsubject, but he was reserved and diffident.\n\nThe untidy bookshelf reminded me of the logbook, and when Davies had\nretired with the crockery to the forecastle, I pulled the ledger down\nand turned over the leaves. It was a mass of short entries, with\ncryptic abbreviations, winds, tides, weather, and courses appearing\nto predominate. The voyage from Dover to Ostend was dismissed in two\nlines: 'Under way 7 p.m., wind W.S.W. moderate; West Hinder 5 a.m.,\noutside all banks; Ostend 11 a.m.' The Scheldt had a couple of pages\nvery technical and _staccato_ in style. Inland Holland was given a\ncontemptuous summary, with some half-hearted allusions to windmills,\nand so on, and a caustic word or two about boys, paint, and canal\nsmells.\n\nAt Amsterdam technicalities began again, and a brisker tone pervaded\nthe entries, which became progressively fuller as the writer cruised\non the Frisian coast. He was clearly in better spirits, for here and\nthere were quaint and laboured efforts to describe nature out of\nmaterial which, as far as I could judge, was repellent enough to\ndiscourage the most brilliant and observant of writers; with an\noccasional note of a visit on shore, generally reached by a walk of\nhalf a mile over sand, and of talks with shop people and fishermen.\nBut such lighter relief was rare. The bulk dealt with channels and\nshoals with weird and depressing names, with the centre-plate, the\nsails, and the wind, buoys and 'booms', tides and 'berths' for the\nnight. 'Kedging off' appeared to be a frequent diversion; 'running\naground' was of almost daily occurrence.\n\nIt was not easy reading, and I turned the leaves rapidly. I was\ncurious, too, to see the latter part. I came to a point where the\nrain of little sentences, pattering out like small shot, ceased\nabruptly. It was at the end of September 9. That day, with its\n'kedging' and 'boom-dodging', was filled in with the usual detail.\nThe log then leapt over three days, and went on: '_Sept._ 13. Wind\nW.N.W. fresh. Decided to go to Baltic. Sailed 4 a.m. Quick passage E.\n1\/2 S. to mouth of Weser. Anchored for night under Hohenh\u00c3\u00b6rn Sand.\nSept. 14, _nil_. Sept. 15., under way at 4 a.m. Wind East moderate.\nCourse W. by S.; four miles; N.E. by N. fifteen miles. Norderpiep\n9.30. Eider River 11.30.' This recital of naked facts was quite\ncharacteristic when 'passages' were concerned, and any curiosity I\nhad felt about his reticence on the previous night would have been\nrather allayed than stimulated had I not noticed that a page had been\ntorn out of the book just at this point. The frayed edge left had\nbeen pruned and picked into very small limits; but dissimulation was\nnot Davies's strong point, and a child could have seen that a leaf\nwas missing, and that the entries, starting from the evening of\nSeptember 9 (where a page ended), had been written together at one\nsitting. I was on the point of calling to Davies, and chaffing him\nwith having committed a grave offence against maritime law in having\n'cooked' his log; but I checked myself, I scarcely know why, probably\nbecause I guessed the joke would touch a sensitive place and fail.\nDelicacy shrank from seeing him compelled either to amplify a\ndeception or blunder out a confession--he was too easy a prey; and,\nafter all, the matter was of small moment. I returned the book to the\nshelf, the only definite result of its perusal being to recall my\npromise to keep a diary myself, and I then and there dedicated a\nnotebook to the purpose.\n\nWe were just lighting our cigars when we heard voices and the splash\nof oars, followed by a bump against the hull which made Davies wince,\nas violations of his paint always did. 'Guten Abend; wo fahren Sie\nhin?' greeted us as we climbed on deck. It turned out to be some\njovial fishermen returning to their smack from a visit to Sonderburg.\nA short dialogue proved to them that we were mad Englishmen in bitter\nneed of charity.\n\n'Come to Satrup,' they said; 'all the smacks are there, round the\npoint. There is good punch in the inn.'\n\nNothing loth, we followed in the dinghy, skirted a bend of the Sound,\nand opened up the lights of a village, with some smacks at anchor in\nfront of it. We were escorted to the inn, and introduced to a\nformidable beverage, called coffee-punch, and a smoke-wreathed circle\nof smacksmen, who talked German out of courtesy, but were Danish in\nall else. Davies was at once at home with them, to a degree, indeed,\nthat I envied. His German was of the crudest kind, _bizarre_ in\nvocabulary and comical in accent; but the freemasonry of the sea, or\nsome charm of his own, gave intuition to both him and his hearers. I\ncut a poor figure in this nautical gathering, though Davies, who\npersistently referred to me as 'meiner Freund', tried hard to\nrepresent me as a kindred spirit and to include me in the general\ntalk. I was detected at once as an uninteresting hybrid. Davies, who\nsometimes appealed to me for a word, was deep in talk over anchorages\nand ducks, especially, as I well remember now, about the chance of\nsport in a certain _Schlei Fiord_. I fell into utter neglect, till\nrescued by a taciturn person in spectacles and a very high cap, who\nappeared to be the only landsman present. After silently puffing\nsmoke in my direction for some time, he asked me if I was married,\nand if not, when I proposed to be. After this inquisition he\nabandoned me.\n\nIt was eleven before we left this hospitable inn, escorted by the\nwhole party to the dinghy. Our friends of the smack insisted on our\nsharing their boat out of pure good-fellowship--for there was not\nnearly room for us--and would not let us go till a bucket of\nfresh-caught fish had been emptied into her bottom. After much\nshaking of scaly hands, we sculled back to the _Dulcibella_, where she\nslept in a bed of tremulous stars.\n\nDavies sniffed the wind and scanned the tree-tops, where light gusts\nwere toying with the leaves.\n\n'Sou'-west still,' he said, 'and more rain coming. But it's bound to\nshift into the north.'\n\n'Will that be a good wind for us?'\n\n'It depends where we go,' he said, slowly. 'I was asking those\nfellows about duck-shooting. They seemed to think the best place\nwould be Schlei Fiord. That's about fifteen miles south of\nSonderburg, on the way to Kiel. They said there was a pilot chap\nliving at the mouth who would tell us all about it. They weren't very\nencouraging though. We should want a north wind for that.'\n\n'I don't care where we go,' I said, to my own surprise.\n\n'Don't you really?' he rejoined, with sudden warmth. Then, with a\nslight change of voice. 'You mean it's all very jolly about here?'\n\nOf course I meant that. Before we went below we both looked for a\nmoment at the little grey memorial; its slender fretted arch outlined\nin tender lights and darks above the hollow on the Alsen shore. The\nnight was that of September 27, the third I had spent on the\n_Dulcibella_.\n\n\n\n\nVI. Schlei Fiord\n\n\nI MAKE no apology for having described these early days in some\ndetail. It is no wonder that their trivialities are as vividly before\nme as the colours of earth and sea in this enchanting corner of the\nworld. For every trifle, sordid or picturesque, was relevant; every\nscrap of talk a link; every passing mood critical for good or ill. So\nslight indeed were the determining causes that changed my autumn\nholiday into an undertaking the most momentous I have ever\napproached.\n\nTwo days more preceded the change. On the first, the southwesterly\nwind still holding, we sallied forth into Augustenburg Fiord, 'to\npractise smartness in a heavy thresh,' as Davies put it. It was the\nday of dedication for those disgusting oilskins, immured in whose\nstiff and odorous angles, I felt distressfully cumbersome; a day of\nproof indeed for me, for heavy squalls swept incessantly over the\nloch, and Davies, at my own request, gave me no rest. Backwards and\nforwards we tacked, blustering into coves and out again, reefing and\nunreefing, now stung with rain, now warmed with sun, but never with\ntime to breathe or think.\n\nI wrestled with intractable ropes, slaves if they could be subdued,\ntyrants if they got the upper hand; creeping, craning, straining, I\nmade the painful round of the deck, while Davies, hatless and\ntranquil, directed my blundering movements.\n\n'Now take the helm and try steering in a hard breeze to windward.\nIt's the finest sport on earth.'\n\nSo I grappled with the niceties of that delicate craft; smarting\neyes, chafed hands, and dazed brain all pressed into the service,\nwhilst Davies, taming the ropes the while, shouted into my ear the\nsubtle mysteries of the art; that fidgeting ripple in the luff of the\nmainsail, and the distant rattle from the hungry jib--signs that they\nare starved of wind and must be given more; the heavy list and wallow\nof the hull, the feel of the wind on your cheek instead of your nose,\nthe broader angle of the burgee at the masthead--signs that they have\ntoo much, and that she is sagging recreantly to leeward instead of\nfighting to windward. He taught me the tactics for meeting squalls,\nand the way to press your advantage when they are defeated--the iron\nhand in the velvet glove that the wilful tiller needs if you are to\ngain your ends with it; the exact set of the sheets necessary to get\nthe easiest and swiftest play of the hull--all these things and many\nmore I struggled to apprehend, careless for the moment as to whether\nthey were worth knowing, but doggedly set on knowing them. Needless\nto say, I had no eyes for beauty. The wooded inlets we dived into\ngave a brief respite from wind and spindrift, but called into use the\nlead and the centreboard tackle--two new and cumbrous complexities.\nDavies's passion for intricate navigation had to be sated even in\nthese secure and tideless waters.\n\n'Let's get in as near as we can--you stand by the lead,' was his\nformula; so I made false casts, tripped up in the slack, sent rivers\nof water up my sleeves, and committed all the other _gaucheries_ that\nbeginners in the art commit, while the sand showed whiter beneath the\nkeel, till Davies regretfully drew off and shouted: 'Ready about,\ncentre-plate down,' and I dashed down to the trappings of that\ndiabolical contrivance, the only part of the _Dulcibella_s' equipment\nthat I hated fiercely to the last. It had an odious habit when\nlowered of spouting jets of water through its chain-lead on to the\ncabin floor. One of my duties was to gag it with cotton-waste, but\neven then its choking gurgle was a most uncomfortable sound in your\ndining-room. In a minute the creek would be behind us and we would be\nthumping our stem into the short hollow waves of the fiord, and\nlurching through spray and rain for some point on the opposite shore.\nOf our destination and objects, if we had any, I knew nothing. At the\nnorthern end of the fiord, just before we turned, Davies had turned\ndreamy in the most exasperating way, for I was steering at the time\nand in mortal need of sympathetic guidance, if I was to avoid a\nsudden jibe. As though continuing aloud some internal debate, he held\na onesided argument to the effect that it was no use going farther\nnorth. Ducks, weather, and charts figured in it, but I did not follow\nthe pros and cons. I only know that we suddenly turned and began to\n'battle' south again. At sunset we were back once more in the same\nquiet pool among the trees and fields of Als Sound, a wondrous peace\nsucceeding the turmoil. Bruised and sodden, I was extricating myself\nfrom my oily prison, and later was tasting (though not nearly yet in\nits perfection) the unique exultation that follows such a day, when,\nglowing all over, deliciously tired and pleasantly sore, you eat what\nseems ambrosia, be it only tinned beef; and drink nectar, be it only\ndistilled from terrestrial hops or coffee berries, and inhale as\nculminating luxury balmy fumes which even the happy Homeric gods knew\nnaught of.\n\nOn the following morning, the 30th, a joyous shout of 'Nor'-west\nwind' sent me shivering on deck, in the small hours, to handle\nrain-stiff canvas and cutting chain. It was a cloudy, unsettled day,\nbut still enough after yesterday's boisterous ordeal. We retraced our\nway past Sonderburg, and thence sailed for a faint line of pale green\non the far south-western horizon. It was during this passage that an\nincident occurred, which, slight as it was, opened my eyes to much.\n\nA flight of wild duck crossed our bows at some little distance, a\nwedge-shaped phalanx of craning necks and flapping wings. I happened\nto be steering while Davies verified our course below; but I called\nhim up at once, and a discussion began about our chances of sport.\nDavies was gloomy over them.\n\n'Those fellows at Satrup were rather doubtful,' he said. 'There are\nplenty of ducks, but I made out that it's not easy for strangers to\nget shooting. The whole country's so very civilized; it's not _wild_\nenough, is it?'\n\nHe looked at me. I had no very clear opinion. It was anything but\nwild in one sense, but there seemed to be wild enough spots for\nducks. The shore we were passing appeared to be bordered by lonely\nmarshes, though a spacious champaign showed behind. If it were not\nfor the beautiful places we had seen, and my growing taste for our\nway of seeing them, his disappointing vagueness would have nettled me\nmore than it did. For, after all, he had brought me out loaded with\nsporting equipment under a promise of shooting.\n\n'Bad weather is what we want for ducks,' he said; 'but I'm afraid\nwe're in the wrong place for them. Now, if it was the North Sea,\namong those Frisian Tslands----' His tone was timid and interrogative,\nand I felt at once that he was sounding me as to some unpalatable\nplan whose nature began to dawn on me.\n\nHe stammered on through a sentence or two about 'wildness' and\n'nobody to interfere with you,' and then I broke in: 'You surely\ndon't want to leave the Baltic?'\n\n'Why not?' said he, staring into the compass.\n\n'Hang it, man!' I returned, tartly, 'here we are in October, the\nsummer over, and the weather gone to pieces. We're alone in a\ncockle-shell boat, at a time when every other yacht of our size is\nlaying up for the winter. Luckily, we seem to have struck an ideal\ncruising-ground, with a wide choice of safe fiords and a good\nprospect of ducks, if we choose to take a little trouble about them.\nYou can't mean to waste time and run risks' (I thought of the torn\nleaf in the log-book) 'in a long voyage to those forbidding haunts of\nyours in the North Sea.'\n\n'It's not very long,' said Davies, doggedly. 'Part of it's canal, and\nthe rest is quite safe if you're careful. There's plenty of sheltered\nwater, and it's not really necessary----'\n\n'What's it all _for?_' I interrupted, impatiently. 'We haven't _tried_\nfor shooting here yet. You've no notion, have you, of getting the\nboat back to England this autumn?'\n\n'England?' he muttered. 'Oh, I don't much care.' Again his vagueness\njarred on me; there seemed to be some bar between us, invisible and\ninsurmountable. And, after all, what was I doing here? Roughing it in\na shabby little yacht, utterly out of my element, with a man who, a\nweek ago, was nothing to me, and who now was a tiresome enigma. Like\nswift poison the old morbid mood in which I left London spread\nthrough me. All I had learnt and seen slipped away; what I had\nsuffered remained. I was on the point of saying something which might\nhave put a precipitate end to our cruise, but he anticipated me.\n\n'I'm awfully sorry,' he broke out, 'for being such a selfish brute. I\ndon't know what I was thinking about. You're a brick to join me in\nthis sort of life, and I'm afraid I'm an infernally bad host. Of\ncourse this is just the place to cruise. I forgot about the scenery,\nand all that. Let's ask about the ducks here. As you say, we're sure\nto get sport if we worry and push a bit. We must be nearly there\nnow--yes, there's the entrance. Take the helm, will you?'\n\nHe sprang up the mast like a monkey, and gazed over the land from the\ncross-trees. I looked up at my enigma and thanked Providence I had\nnot spoken; for no one could have resisted his frank outburst of good\nnature. Yet it occurred to me that, considering the conditions of our\nlife, our intimacy was strangely slow in growth. I had no clue yet as\nto where his idiosyncrasies began and his self ended, and he, I\nsurmised, was in the same stage towards me. Otherwise I should have\npressed him further now, for I felt convinced that there was some\nmystery in his behaviour which I had not yet accounted for. However,\nlight was soon to break.\n\nI could see no sign of the entrance he had spoken of, and no wonder,\nfor it is only eighty yards wide, though it leads to a fiord thirty\nmiles long. All at once we were jolting in a tumble of sea, and the\nchannel grudgingly disclosed itself, stealing between marshes and\nmeadows and then broadening to a mere, as at Ekken. We anchored close\nto the mouth, and not far from a group of vessels of a type that\nafterwards grew very familiar to me. They were sailing-barges,\nsomething like those that ply in the Thames, bluff-bowed,\nhigh-sterned craft of about fifty tons, ketch-rigged, and fitted with\nlee-boards, very light spars, and a long tip-tilted bowsprit. (For\nthe future I shall call them 'galliots'.) Otherwise the only sign of\nlife was a solitary white house--the pilot's house, the chart told\nus--close to the northern point of entrance. After tea we called on\nthe pilot. Patriarchally installed before a roaring stove, in the\ncompany of a buxom bustling daughter-in-law and some rosy\ngrandchildren, we found a rotund and rubicund person, who greeted us\nwith a hoarse roar of welcome in German, which instantly changed,\nwhen he saw us, to the funniest broken English, spoken with intense\nrelish and pride. We explained ourselves and our mission as well as\nwe could through the hospitable interruptions caused by beer and the\nstrains of a huge musical box, which had been set going in honour of\nour arrival. Needless to say, I was read like a book at once, and\nfell into the part of listener.\n\n'Yes, yes,' he said, 'all right. There is plenty ducks, but first we\nwill drink a glass beer; then we will shift your ship, captain--she\nlies not good there.' (Davies started up in a panic, but was waved\nback to his beer.) 'Then we will drink together another glass beer;\nthen we will talk of ducks--no, then we will kill ducks--that is\nbetter. Then we will have plenty glasses beer.'\n\nThis was an unexpected climax, and promised well for our prospects.\nAnd the programme was fully carried out. After the beer our host was\npacked briskly by his daughter into an armour of woollen gaiters,\ncoats, and mufflers, topped with a worsted helmet, which left nothing\nof his face visible but a pair of twinkling eyes. Thus equipped, he\nled the way out of doors, and roared for Hans and his gun, till a\ngreat gawky youth, with high cheek-bones and a downy beard, came out\nfrom the yard and sheepishly shook our hands.\n\nTogether we repaired to the quay, where the pilot stood, looking like\na genial ball of worsted, and bawled hoarse directions while we\nshifted the _Dulcibella_ to a berth on the farther shore close to the\nother vessels. We returned with our guns, and the interval for\nrefreshments followed. It was just dusk when we sallied out again,\ncrossed a stretch of bog-land, and took up strategic posts round a\nstagnant pond. Hans had been sent to drive, and the result was a fine\nmallard and three ducks. It was true that all fell to the pilot's\ngun, perhaps owing to Hans's filial instinct and his parent's canny\negotism in choosing his own lair, or perhaps it was chance; but the\nshooting-party was none the less a triumphal success. It was\ncelebrated with beer and music as before, while the pilot, an infant\non each podgy knee, discoursed exuberantly on the glories of his\ncountry and the Elysian content of his life. 'There is plenty beer,\nplenty meat, plenty money, plenty ducks,' summed up his survey.\n\nIt may have been fancy, but Davies, though he had fits and starts of\nvivacity, seemed very inattentive, considering that we were sitting\nat the feet of so expansive an oracle. It was I who elicited most of\nthe practical information--details of time, weather, and likely\nplaces for shooting, with some shrewd hints as to the kind of people\nto conciliate. Whatever he thought of me, I warmed with sympathy\ntowards the pilot, for he assumed that we had done with cruising for\nthe year, and thought us mad enough as it was to have been afloat so\nlong, and madder still to intend living on 'so little a ship' when we\ncould live on land with beer and music handy. I was tempted to raise\nthe North Sea question, just to watch Davies under the thunder of\nrebukes which would follow. But I refrained from a wish to be tender\nwith him, now that all was going so well. The Frisian Islands were an\nextravagant absurdity now. I did not even refer to them as we pulled\nback to the _Dulcibella_, after swearing eternal friendship with the\ngood pilot and his family.\n\nDavies and I turned in good friends that night--or rather I should\nsay that I turned in, for I left him sucking an empty pipe and\naimlessly fingering a volume of Mahan; and once when I woke in the\nnight I felt somehow that his bunk was empty and that he was there in\nthe dark cabin, dreaming.\n\n\n\n\nVII. The Missing Page\n\n\nI WOKE (on the 1st of October) with that dispiriting sensation that a hitch\nhas occurred in a settled plan. It was explained when I went on deck,\nand I found the _Dulcibella_ wrapped in a fog, silent, clammy, nothing\nvisible from her decks but the ghostly hull of a galliot at anchor\nnear us. She must have brought up there in the night, for there had\nbeen nothing so close the evening before; and I remembered that my\nsleep had been broken once by sounds of rumbling chain and gruff\nvoices.\n\n'This looks pretty hopeless for to-day,' I said, with a shiver, to\nDavies, who was laying the breakfast.\n\n'Well, we can't do anything till this fog lifts,' he answered, with a\ngood deal of resignation. Breakfast was a cheerless meal. The damp\npenetrated to the very cabin, whose roof and walls wept a fine dew. I\nhad dreaded a bathe, and yet missed it, and the ghastly light made\nthe tablecloth look dirtier than it naturally was, and all the\naccessories more sordid. Something had gone wrong with the bacon, and\nthe lack of egg-cups was not in the least humorous.\n\nDavies was just beginning, in his summary way, to tumble the things\ntogether for washing up, when there was a sound of a step on deck,\ntwo sea-boots appeared on the ladder, and, before we could wonder who\nthe visitor was, a little man in oilskins and a sou'-wester was\nstooping towards us in the cabin door, smiling affectionately at\nDavies out of a round grizzled beard.\n\n'Well met, captain,' he said, quietly, in German. 'Where are you\nbound to this time?'\n\n'Bartels!' exclaimed Davies, jumping up. The two stooping figures,\nyoung and old, beamed at one another like father and son.\n\n'Where have you come from? Have some coffee. How's the 'Johannes'? Was\nthat you that came in last night? I'm delighted to see you!' (I spare\nthe reader his uncouth lingo.) The little man was dragged in and\nseated on the opposite sofa to me.\n\n'I took my apples to Kappeln,' he said, sedately, 'and now I sail to\nKiel, and so to Hamburg, where my wife and children are. It is my\nlast voyage of the year. You are no longer alone, captain, I see.' He\nhad taken off his dripping sou'-wester and was bowing ceremoniously\ntowards me.\n\n'Oh, I quite forgot!' said Davies, who had been kneeling on one knee\nin the low doorway, absorbed in his visitor. 'This is \"_meiner\nFreund_,\" Herr Carruthers. Carruthers, this is my friend, Schiffer\nBartels, of the galliot 'Johannes'.'\n\nWas I never to be at an end of the puzzles which Davies presented to\nme? All the impulsive heartiness died out of his voice and manner as\nhe uttered the last few words, and there he was, nervously glancing\nfrom the visitor to me, like one who, against his will or from\ntactlessness, has introduced two persons who he knows will disagree.\n\nThere was a pause while he fumbled with the cups, poured some cold\ncoffee out and pondered over it as though it were a chemical\nexperiment. Then he muttered something about boiling some more water,\nand took refuge in the forecastle. I was ill at ease at this period\nwith seafaring men, but this mild little person was easy ground for a\nbeginner. Besides, when he took off his oilskin coat he reminded me\nless of a sailor than of a homely draper of some country town, with\nhis clean turned-down collar and neatly fitting frieze jacket. We\nexchanged some polite platitudes about the fog and his voyage last\nnight from Kappeln, which appeared to be a town some fifteen miles up\nthe fiord.\n\nDavies joined in from the forecastle with an excess of warmth which\nalmost took the words out of my mouth. We exhausted the subject very\nsoon, and then my _vis-\u00c3\u00a0-vis_ smiled paternally at me, as he had done\nat Davies, and said, confidentially:\n\n'It is good that the captain is no more alone. He is a fine young\nman--Heaven, what a fine young man! I love him as my son--but he is\ntoo brave, too reckless. It is good for him to have a friend.'\n\nI nodded and laughed, though in reality I was very far from being\namused.\n\n'Where was it you met?' I asked.\n\n'In an ugly place, and in ugly weather,' he answered, gravely, but\nwith a twinkle of fun in his eye. 'But has he not told you?' he\nadded, with ponderous slyness. 'I came just in time. No! what am I\nsaying? He is brave as a lion and quick as a cat. I think he cannot\ndrown; but still it was an ugly place and ugly----'\n\n'What are you talking about, Bartels?' interrupted Davies, emerging\nnoisily with a boiling kettle.\n\nI answered the question. 'I was just asking your friend how it was\nyou made his acquaintance.'\n\n'Oh, he helped me out of a bit of a mess in the North Sea, didn't\nyou, Bartels?' he said.\n\n'It was nothing,' said Bartels. 'But the North Sea is no place for\nyour little boat, captain. So I have told you many times. How did you\nlike Flensburg? A fine town, is it not? Did you find Herr Krank, the\ncarpenter? I see you have placed a little mizzen-mast. The rudder was\nnothing much, but it was well that it held to the Eider. But she is\nstrong and good, your little ship, and--Heaven!--she had need be so.'\nHe chuckled, and shook his head at Davies as at a wayward child.\n\nThis is all the conversation that I need record. For my part I merely\nwaited for its end, determined on my course, which was to know the\ntruth once and for all, and make an end of these distracting\nmystifications. Davies plied his friend with coffee, and kept up the\ntalk gallantly; but affectionate as he was, his manner plainly showed\nthat he wanted to be alone with me.\n\nThe gist of the little skipper's talk was a parental warning that,\nthough we were well enough here in the 'Ost-See', it was time for\nlittle boats to be looking for winter quarters. That he himself was\ngoing by the Kiel Canal to Hamburg to spend a cosy winter as a decent\ncitizen at his warm fireside, and that we should follow his example.\nHe ended with an invitation to us to visit him on the 'Johannes', and\nwith suave farewells disappeared into the fog. Davies saw him into\nhis boat, returned without wasting a moment, and sat down on the sofa\nopposite me.\n\n'What did he mean?' I asked.\n\n'I'll tell you,' said Davies, 'I'll tell you the whole thing. As far\nas you're concerned it's partly a confession. Last night I had made\nup my mind to say nothing, but when Bartels turned up I knew it must\nall come out. It's been fearfully on my mind, and perhaps you'll be\nable to help me. But it's for you to decide.'\n\n'Fire away!' I said.\n\n'You know what I was saying about the Frisian Islands the other day?\nA thing happened there which I never told you, when you were asking\nabout my cruise.'\n\n'It began near Norderney,' I put in.\n\n'How did you guess that?' he asked.\n\n'You're a bad hand at duplicity,' I replied. 'Go on.'\n\n'Well, you're quite right, it was there, on September 9. I told you\nthe sort of thing I was doing at that time, but I don't think I said\nthat I made inquiries from one or two people about duck-shooting, and\nhad been told by some fishermen at Borkum that there was a big\nsailing-yacht in those waters, whose owner, a German of the name of\nDollmann, shot a good deal, and might give me some tips. Well, I\nfound this yacht one evening, knowing it must be her from the\ndescription I had. She was what is called a \"barge-yacht\", of fifty\nor sixty tons, built for shallow water on the lines of a Dutch\ngalliot, with lee-boards and those queer round bows and square stern.\nShe's something like those galliots anchored near us now. You\nsometimes see the same sort of yacht in English waters, only there\nthey copy the Thames barges. She looked a clipper of her sort, and\nvery smart; varnished all over and shining like gold. I came on her\nabout sunset, after a long day of exploring round the Ems estuary.\nShe was lying in---'\n\n'Wait a bit, let's have the chart,' I interrupted.\n\nDavies found it and spread it on the table between us, first pushing\nback the cloth and the breakfast things to one end, where they lay in\na slovenly litter. This was one of the only two occasions on which I\never saw him postpone the rite of washing up, and it spoke volumes\nfor the urgency of the matter in hand.\n\n'Here it is,' said Davies _[See Map A]_ and I looked with a new and\nstrange interest at the long string of slender islands, the parallel\nline of coast, and the confusion of shoals, banks, and channels which\nlay between. 'Here's Norderney, you see. By the way, there's a\nharbour there at the west end of the island, the only real harbour on\nthe whole line of islands, Dutch or German, except at Terschelling.\nThere's quite a big town there, too, a watering place, where Germans\ngo for sea-bathing in the summer. Well, the 'Medusa', that was her\nname, was lying in the Riff Gat roadstead, flying the German ensign,\nand I anchored for the night pretty near her. I meant to visit her\nowner later on, but I very nearly changed my mind, as I always feel\nrather a fool on smart yachts, and my German isn't very good.\nHowever, I thought I might as well; so, after dinner, when it was\ndark, I sculled over in the dinghy, hailed a sailor on deck, said who\nI was, and asked if I could see the owner. The sailor was a surly\nsort of chap, and there was a good long delay while I waited on deck,\nfeeling more and more uncomfortable. Presently a steward came up and\nshowed me down the companion and into the saloon, which, after\n_this_, looked--well, horribly gorgeous--you know what I mean, plush\nlounges, silk cushions, and that sort of thing. Dinner seemed to be\njust over, and wine and fruit were on the table. Herr Dollmann was\nthere at his coffee. I introduced myself somehow----'\n\n'Stop a moment,' I said; 'what was he like?'\n\n'Oh, a tall, thin chap, in evening dress; about fifty I suppose, with\ngreyish hair and a short beard. I'm not good at describing people. He\nhad a high, bulging forehead, and there was something about him--but\nI think I'd better tell you the bare facts first. I can't say he\nseemed pleased to see me, and he couldn't speak English, and, in\nfact, I felt infernally awkward. Still, I had an object in coming,\nand as I was there I thought I might as well gain it.'\n\nThe notion of Davies in his Norfolk jacket and rusty flannels\nharanguing a frigid German in evening dress in a 'gorgeous' saloon\ntickled my fancy greatly.\n\n'He seemed very much astonished to see me; had evidently seen the\n_Dulcibella_ arrive, and had wondered what she was. I began as soon as\nI could about the ducks, but he shut me up at once, said I could do\nnothing hereabouts. I put it down to sportsman's jealousy--you know\nwhat that is. But I saw I had come to the wrong shop, and was just\ngoing to back out and end this unpleasant interview, when he thawed a\nbit, offered me some wine, and began talking in quite a friendly way,\ntaking a great interest in my cruise and my plans for the future. In\nthe end we sat up quite late, though I never felt really at my ease.\nHe seemed to be taking stock of me all the time, as though I were\nsome new animal.' (How I sympathized with that German!) 'We parted\ncivilly enough, and I rowed back and turned in, meaning to potter on\neastwards early next day.\n\n'But I was knocked up at dawn by a sailor with a message from\nDollmann asking if he could come to breakfast with me. I was rather\nflabbergasted, but didn't like to be rude, so I said, \"Yes.\" Well, he\ncame, and I returned the call--and--well, the end of it was that I\nstayed at anchor there for three days.' This was rather abrupt.\n\n'How did you spend the time?' I asked. Stopping three days anywhere\nwas an unusual event for him, as I knew from his log.\n\n'Oh, I lunched or dined with him once or twice--with _them_, I ought\nto say,' he added, hurriedly. 'His daughter was with him. She didn't\nappear the evening I first called.'\n\n'And what was she like?' I asked, promptly, before he could hurry on.\n\n'Oh, she seemed a very nice girl,' was the guarded reply, delivered\nwith particular unconcern, 'and--the end of it was that I and the\n'Medusa' sailed away in company. I must tell you how it came about,\njust in a few words for the present.\n\n'It was his suggestion. He said he had to sail to Hamburg, and\nproposed that I should go with him in the _Dulcibella_ as far as the\nElbe, and then, if I liked, I could take the ship canal at\nBrunsb\u00c3\u00bcttel through to Kiel and the Baltic. I had no very fixed plans\nof my own, though I had meant to go on exploring eastwards between\nthe islands and the coast, and so reach the Elbe in a much slower\nway. He dissuaded me from this, sticking to it that I should have no\nchance of ducks, and urging other reasons. Anyway, we settled to sail\nin company direct to Cuxhaven, in the Elbe. With a fair wind and an\nearly start it should be only one day's sail of about sixty miles.\n\n'The plan only came to a head on the evening of the third day, on the 12th of\nSeptember.\n\n'I told you, I think, that the weather had broken after a long spell\nof heat. That very day it had been blowing pretty hard from the west,\nand the glass was falling still. I said, of course, that I couldn't\ngo with him if the weather was too bad, but he prophesied a good day,\nsaid it was an easy sail, and altogether put me on my mettle. You can\nguess how it was. Perhaps I had talked about single-handed cruising\nas though it were easier than it was, though I never meant it in a\nboasting way, for I hate that sort of thing, and besides there _is_\nno danger if you're careful----'\n\n'Oh, go on,' I said.\n\n'Anyway, we went next morning at six. It was a dirty-looking day,\nwind W.N.W., but his sails were going up and mine followed. I took\ntwo reefs in, and we sailed out into the open and steered E.N.E.\nalong the coast for the Outer Elbe Lightship about fifty knots off.\nHere it all is, you see.' (He showed me the course on the chart.)\n'The trip was nothing for his boat, of course, a safe, powerful old\ntub, forging through the sea as steady as a house. I kept up with her\neasily at first. My hands were pretty full, for there was a hard wind\non my quarter and a troublesome sea; but as long as nothing worse\ncame I knew I should be all right, though I also knew that I was a\nfool to have come.\n\n[Illustration: Chart A to Illustrate the Stranding of the _Dulcibella,_ etc.]\n\n'All went well till we were off Wangeroog, the last of the\nislands--_here_--and then it began to blow really hard. I had half a\nmind to chuck it and cut into the Jade River, _down there_,' but I\nhadn't the face to, so I hove to and took in my last reef.' (Simple\nwords, simply uttered; but I had seen the operation in calm water and\nshuddered at the present picture.) 'We had been about level till\nthen, but with my shortened canvas I fell behind. Not that that\nmattered in the least. I knew my course, had read up my tides, and,\nthick as the weather was, I had no doubt of being able to pick up the\nlightship. No change of plan was possible now. The Weser estuary was\non my starboard hand, but the whole place was a lee-shore and a mass\nof unknown banks--just look at them. I ran on, the _Dulcibella_ doing\nher level best, but we had some narrow shaves of being pooped. I was\nabout _here_, say six miles south-west of the lightship, _[See Chart\nA]_ when I suddenly saw that the 'Medusa' had hove to right ahead, as\nthough waiting till I came up. She wore round again on the course as\nI drew level, and we were alongside for a bit. Dollmann lashed the\nwheel, leaned over her quarter, and shouted, very slowly and\ndistinctly so that I could understand; \"Follow me--sea too bad for\nyou outside--short cut through sands--save six miles.\"\n\n'It was taking me all my time to manage the tiller, but I knew what\nhe meant at once, for I had been over the chart carefully the night\nbefore. _[See Map A]_ You see, the whole bay between Wangeroog and\nthe Elbe is encumbered with sand. A great jagged chunk of it runs out\nfrom Cuxhaven in a north-westerly direction for fifteen miles or so,\nending in a pointed spit, called the _Scharhorn_. To reach the Elbe\nfrom the west you have to go right outside this, round the lightship,\nwhich is off the Scharhorn, and double back. Of course, that's what\nall big vessels do. But, as you see, these sands are intersected here\nand there by channels, very shallow and winding, exactly like those\nbehind the Frisian Islands. Now look at this one, which cuts right\nthrough the big chunk of sand and comes out near Cuxhaven. The\n_Telte_ _[See Chart A]_ it's called. It's miles wide, you see, at the\nentrance, but later on it is split into two by the Hohenh\u00c3\u00b6rn bank:\nthen it gets shallow and very complicated, and ends in a mere tidal\ndriblet with another name. It's just the sort of channel I should\nlike to worry into on a fine day or with an off-shore wind. Alone, in\nthick weather and a heavy sea, it would have been folly to attempt\nit, except as a desperate resource. But, as I said I knew at once\nthat Dollmann was proposing to run for it and guide me in.\n\n'I didn't like the idea, because I like doing things for myself, and,\nsilly as it sounds, I believe I resented being told the sea was too\nbad for me, which it certainly was. Yet the short cut did save\nseveral miles and a devil of a tumble off the Scharhorn, where two\ntides meet. I had complete faith in Dollmann, and I suppose I decided\nthat I should be a fool not to take a good chance. I hesitated. I\nknow; but in the end I nodded, and held up my arm as she forged ahead\nagain. Soon after, she shifted her course and I followed. You asked\nme once if I ever took a pilot. That was the only time.'\n\nHe spoke with bitter gravity, flung himself back, and felt his pocket\nfor his pipe. It was not meant for a dramatic pause, but it certainly\nwas one. I had just a glimpse of still another Davies--a Davies five\nyears older throbbing with deep emotions, scorn, passion, and stubborn\npurpose; a being above my plane, of sterner stuff, wider scope. Intense\nas my interest had become, I waited almost timidly while he mechanically\nrammed tobacco into his pipe and struck ineffectual matches. I felt that\nwhatever the riddle to be solved, it was no mean one. He repressed\nhimself with an effort, half rose, and made his circular glance at the\nclock, barometer, and skylight, and then resumed.\n\n'We soon came to what I knew must be the beginning of the Telte\nchannel. All round you could hear the breakers on the sands, though\nit was too thick to see them yet. As the water shoaled, the sea, of\ncourse, got shorter and steeper. There was more wind--a whole gale I\nshould say.\n\n'I kept dead in the wake of the 'Medusa', but to my disgust I found she\nwas gaining on me very fast. Of course I had taken for granted, when\nhe said he would lead me in, that he would slow down and keep close\nto me. He could easily have done so by getting his men up to check\nhis sheets or drop his peak. Instead of that he was busting on for\nall he was worth. Once, in a rain-squall, I lost sight of him\naltogether; got him faintly again, but had enough to do with my own\ntiller not to want to be peering through the scud after a runaway\npilot. I was all right so far, but we were fast approaching the worst\npart of the whole passage, where the Hohenh\u00c3\u00b6rn bank blocks the road,\nand the channel divides. I don't know what it looks like to you on\nthe chart--perhaps fairly simple, because you can follow the twists\nof the channels, as on a ground-plan; but a stranger coming to a\nplace like that (where there are no buoys, mind you) can tell nothing\ncertain by the eye--unless perhaps at dead low water, when the banks\nare high and dry, and in very clear weather--he must trust to the\nlead and the compass, and feel his way step by step. I knew perfectly\nwell that what I should soon see would be a wall of surf stretching\nright across and on both sides. To _feel_ one's way in that sort of\nweather is impossible. You must _know_ your way, or else have a\npilot. I had one, but he was playing his own game.\n\n'With a second hand on board to steer while I conned I should have\nfelt less of an ass. As it was, I knew I ought to be facing the music\nin the offing, and cursed myself for having broken my rule and gone\nblundering into this confounded short cut. It was giving myself away,\ndoing just the very thing that you can't do in single-handed sailing.\n\n'By the time I realized the danger it was far too late to turn and\nhammer out to the open. I was deep in the bottle-neck bight of the\nsands, jammed on a lee shore, and a strong flood tide sweeping me on.\nThat tide, by the way, gave just the ghost of a chance. I had the\nhours in my head, and knew it was about two-thirds flood, with two\nhours more of rising water. That meant the banks would be all\ncovering when I reached them, and harder than ever to locate; but it\nalso meant that I _might_ float right over the worst of them if I hit\noff a lucky place.' Davies thumped the table in disgust. 'Pah! It\nmakes me sick to think of having to trust to an accident like that,\nlike a lubberly cockney out for a boozy Bank Holiday sail. Well, just\nas I foresaw, the wall of surf appeared clean across the horizon, and\ncurling back to shut me in, booming like thunder. When I last saw the\n'Medusa' she seemed to be charging it like a horse at a fence, and I\ntook a rough bearing of her position by a hurried glance at the\ncompass. At that very moment I _thought_ she seemed to luff and show\nsome of her broadside; but a squall blotted her out and gave me hell\nwith the tiller. After that she was lost in the white mist that hung\nover the line of breakers. I kept on my bearing as well as I could,\nbut I was already out of the channel. I knew that by the look of the\nwater, and as we neared the bank I saw it was all awash and without\nthe vestige of an opening. I wasn't going to chuck her on to it\nwithout an effort; so, more by instinct than with any particular\nhope, I put the helm down, meaning to work her along the edge on the\nchance of spotting a way over. She was buried at once by the beam\nsea, and the jib flew to blazes; but the reefed stays'l stood, she\nrecovered gamely, and I held on, though I knew it could only be for a\nfew minutes, as the centre-plate was up, and she made frightful\nleeway towards the bank.\n\n'I was half-blinded by scud, but suddenly I noticed what looked like\na gap, behind a spit which curled out right ahead. I luffed still\nmore to clear this spit, but she couldn't weather it. Before you\ncould say knife she was driving across it, bumped heavily, bucked\nforward again, bumped again, and--ripped on in deeper water! I can't\ndescribe the next few minutes. I was in some sort of channel, but a\nvery narrow one, and the sea broke everywhere. I hadn't proper\ncommand either; for the rudder had crocked up somehow at the last\nbump. I was like a drunken man running for his life down a dark\nalley, barking himself at every corner. It couldn't last long, and\nfinally we went crash on to something and stopped there, grinding and\nbanging. So ended that little trip under a pilot.\n\n'Well, it was like this--there was really no danger'--I opened my\neyes at the characteristic phrase. 'I mean, that lucky stumble into a\nchannel was my salvation. Since then I had struggled through a mile\nof sands, all of which lay behind me like a breakwater against the\ngale. They were covered, of course, and seething like soapsuds; but\nthe force of the sea was deadened. The 'Dulce' was bumping, but not too\nheavily. It was nearing high tide, and at half ebb she would be high\nand dry.\n\n'In the ordinary way I should have run out a kedge with the dinghy,\nand at the next high water sailed farther in and anchored where I\ncould lie afloat. The trouble was now that my hand was hurt and my\ndinghy stove in, not to mention the rudder business. It was the first\nbump on the outer edge that did the damage. There was a heavy swell\nthere, and when we struck, the dinghy, which was towing astern, came\nhome on her painter and down with a crash on the yacht's weather\nquarter. I stuck out one hand to ward it off and got it nipped on the\ngunwale. She was badly stove in and useless, so I couldn't run out\nthe kedge'--this was Greek to me, but I let him go on--'and for the\npresent my hand was too painful even to stow the boom and sails,\nwhich were whipping and racketing about anyhow. There was the\nrudder, too, to be mended; and we were several miles from the nearest\nland. Of course, if the wind fell, it was all easy enough; but if it\nheld or increased it was a poor look-out. There's a limit to strain\nof that sort--and other things might have happened.\n\n'In fact, it was precious lucky that Bartels turned up. His galliot\nwas at anchor a mile away, up a branch of the channel. In a clear\nbetween squalls he saw us, and, like a brick, rowed his boat out--he\nand his boy, and a devil of a pull they must have had. I was glad\nenough to see them--no, that's not true; I was in such a fury of\ndisgust and shame that I believe I should have been idiot enough to\nsay I didn't want help, if he hadn't just nipped on board and started\nwork. He's a terror to work, that little mouse of a chap. In half an\nhour he had stowed the sails, unshackled the big anchor, run out\nfifty fathoms of warp, and hauled her off there and then into deep\nwater. Then they towed her up the channel--it was dead to leeward and\nan easy job--and berthed her near their own vessel. It was dark by\nthat time, so I gave them a drink, and said good-night. It blew a\nhowling gale that night, but the place was safe enough, with good\nground-tackle.\n\n'The whole affair was over; and after supper I thought hard about it\nall.'\n\n\n\n\nVIII. The Theory\n\n\nDAVIES leaned back and gave a deep sigh, as though he still felt the\nrelief from some tension. I did the same, and felt the same relief.\nThe chart, freed from the pressure of our fingers, rolled up with a\nflip, as though to say, 'What do you think of that?' I have\nstraightened out his sentences a little, for in the excitement of his\nstory they had grown more and more jerky and elliptical.\n\n'What about Dollmann?' I asked.\n\n'Of course,' said Davies, 'what about him? I didn't get at much that\nnight. It was all so sudden. The only thing I could have sworn to\nfrom the first was that he had purposely left me in the lurch that\nday. I pieced out the rest in the next few days, which I'll just\nfinish with as shortly as I can. Bartels came aboard next morning,\nand though it was blowing hard still we managed to shift the\n_Dulcibella_ to a place where she dried safely at the midday low\nwater, and we could get at her rudder. The lower screw-plate on the\nstern post had wrenched out, and we botched it up roughly as a\nmakeshift. There were other little breakages, but nothing to matter,\nand the loss of the jib was nothing, as I had two spare ones. The\ndinghy was past repair just then, and I lashed it on deck.\n\n'It turned out that Bartels was carrying apples from Bremen to\nKappeln (in this fiord), and had run into that channel in the sands\nfor shelter from the weather. To-day he was bound for the Eider\nRiver, whence, as I told you, you can get through (by river and\ncanal) into the Baltic. Of course the Elbe route, by the new Kaiser\nWilhelm ship canal, is the shortest. The Eider route is the old one,\nbut he hoped to get rid of some of his apples at T\u00c3\u00b6nning, the town at\nits mouth. Both routes touch the Baltic at Kiel. As you know, I had\nbeen running for the Elbe, but yesterday's muck-up put me off, and I\nchanged my mind--I'll tell you why presently--and decided to sail to\nthe Eider along with the 'Johannes' and get through that way. It\ncleared from the east next day, and I raced him there, winning hands\ndown, left him at T\u00c3\u00b6nning, and in three days was in the Baltic. It\nwas just a week after I ran ashore that I wired to you. You see, I\nhad come to the conclusion that _that chap was a spy_.'\n\nIn the end it came out quite quietly and suddenly, and left me in\nprofound amazement. 'I wired to you--that chap was a spy.' It was the\nclose association of these two ideas that hit me hardest at the\nmoment. For a second I was back in the dreary splendour of the London\nclub-room, spelling out that crabbed scrawl from Davies, and\nfastidiously criticizing its proposal in the light of a holiday.\nHoliday! What was to be its issue? Chilling and opaque as the fog\nthat filtered through the skylight there flooded my imagination a\nmist of doubt and fear.\n\n'A spy!' I repeated blankly. 'What do you mean? Why did you wire to\nme? A spy of what--of whom?'\n\n'I'll tell you how I worked it out,' said Davies. 'I don't think\n\"spy\" is the right word; but I mean something pretty bad.\n\n'He purposely put me ashore. I don't think I'm suspicious by nature,\nbut I know something about boats and the sea. I know he could have\nkept close to me if he had chosen, and I saw the whole place at low\nwater when we left those sands on the second day. Look at the chart\nagain. Here's the Hohenh\u00c3\u00b6rn bank that I showed you as blocking the\nroad. _[See Chart A]_ It's in two pieces--first the west and then the\neast. You see the Telte channel dividing into two branches and\ncurving round it. Both branches are broad and deep, as channels go in\nthose waters. Now, in sailing in I was nowhere near either of them.\nWhen I last saw Dollmann he must have been steering straight for the\nbank itself, at a point somewhere _here_, quite a mile from the\nnorthern arm of the channel, and two from the southern. I followed by\ncompass, as you know, and found nothing but breakers ahead. How did I\nget through? That's where the luck came in. I spoke of only two\nchannels, that is, _round_ the bank--one to the north, the other to\nthe south. But look closely and you'll see that right through the\ncentre of the West Hohenh\u00c3\u00b6rn runs another, a very narrow and winding\none, so small that I hadn't even noticed it the night before, when I\nwas going over the chart. That was the one I stumbled into in that\ntailor's fashion, as I was groping along the edge of the surf in a\ndesperate effort to gain time. I bolted down it blindly, came out\ninto this strip of open water, crossed that aimlessly, and brought up\non the edge of the _East_ Hohenh\u00c3\u00b6rn, _here_. It was more than I\ndeserved. I can see now that it was a hundred to one in favour of my\nstriking on a bad place outside, where I should have gone to pieces\nin three minutes.'\n\n'And how did Dollmann go?' I asked.\n\n'It's as clear as possible,' Davies answered. 'He doubled back into\nthe northern channel when he had misled me enough. Do you remember my\nsaying that when I last saw him I _thought_ he had luffed and showed\nhis broadside? I had another bit of luck in that. He was luffing\ntowards the north--so it struck me through the blur--and when I in my\nturn came up to the bank, and had to turn one way or the other to\navoid it, I think I should naturally have turned north too, as he had\ndone. In that case I should have been done for, for I should have had\na mile of the bank to skirt before reaching the north channel, and\nshould have driven ashore long before I got there. But as a matter of\nfact I turned south.'\n\n'Why?'\n\n'Couldn't help it. I was running on the starboard tack--boom over to\nport; to turn north would have meant a jibe, and as things were I\ncouldn't risk one. It was blowing like fits; if anything had carried\naway I should have been on shore in a jiffy. I scarcely thought about\nit at all, but put the helm down and turned her south. Though I knew\nnothing about it, that little central channel was now on my port\nhand, distant about two cables. The whole thing was luck from\nbeginning to end.'\n\nHelped by pluck, I thought to myself, as I tried with my landsman's\nfancy to conjure up that perilous scene. As to the truth of the\naffair, the chart and Davies's version were easy enough to follow,\nbut I felt only half convinced. The 'spy', as Davies strangely called\nhis pilot, might have honestly mistaken the course himself,\noutstripped his convoy inadvertently, and escaped disaster as\nnarrowly as she did. I suggested this on the spur of the moment, but\nDavies was impatient.\n\n'Wait till you hear the whole thing,' he said. 'I must go back to\nwhen I first met him. I told you that on that first evening he began\nby being as rude as a bear and as cold as stone, and then became\nsuddenly friendly. I can see now that in the talk that followed he\nwas pumping me hard. It was an easy game to play, for I hadn't seen a\ngentleman since Morrison left me, I was tremendously keen about my\nvoyage, and I thought the chap was a good sportsman, even if he was a\nbit dark about the ducks. I talked quite freely--at least, as freely\nas I could with my bad German--about my last fortnight's sailing; how\nI had been smelling out all the channels in and out of the islands,\nhow interested I had been in the whole business, puzzling out the\neffect of the winds on the tides, the set of the currents, and so on.\nI talked about my difficulties, too; the changes in the buoys, the\nprehistoric rottenness of the English charts. He drew me out as much\nas he could, and in the light of what followed I can see the point of\nscores of his questions.\n\n'The next day and the next I saw a good deal of him, and the same\nthing went on. And then there were my plans for the future. My idea\nwas, as I told you, to go on exploring the German coast just as I had\nthe Dutch. His idea--Heavens, how plainly I see it now!--was to choke\nme off, get me to clear out altogether from that part of the coast.\nThat was why he said there were no ducks. That was why he cracked up\nthe Baltic as a cruising-ground and shooting-ground. And that was why\nhe broached and stuck to that plan of sailing in company direct to\nthe Elbe. It was to _see_ me clear.\n\n'He improved on that.'\n\n'Yes, but after that, it's guess-work. I mean that I can't tell when he\nfirst decided to go one better and drown me. He couldn't count for\ncertain on bad weather, though he held my nose to it when it came. But,\ngranted that he wanted to get rid of me altogether, he got a magnificent\nchance on that trip to the Elbe lightship. I expect it struck him\nsuddenly, and he acted on the impulse. Left to myself I was all right;\nbut the short cut was a grand idea of his. Everything was in its\nfavour--wind, sea, sand, tide. He thinks I'm dead.'\n\n'But the crew?' I said; 'what about the crew?'\n\n'That's another thing. When he first hove to, waiting for me, of\ncourse they were on deck (two of them, I think) hauling at sheets.\nBut by the time I had drawn up level the 'Medusa' had worn round again\non her course, and no one was on deck but Dollmann at the wheel. No\none overheard what he said.'\n\n'Wouldn't they have _seen_ you again?'\n\n'Very likely not; the weather was very thick, and the 'Dulce' is very\nsmall.'\n\nThe incongruity of the whole business was striking me. Why should\nanyone want to kill Davies, and why should Davies, the soul of\nmodesty and simplicity, imagine that anyone wanted to kill him? He\nmust have cogent reasons, for he was the last man to give way to a\nmorbid fancy.\n\n'Go on,' I said. 'What was his motive? A German finds an Englishman\nexploring a bit of German coast, determines to stop him, and even to\nget rid of him. It looks so far as if you were thought to be the spy.\n\nDavies winced. '_But he's not a German_,' he said, hotly. 'He's an\nEnglishman.'\n\n'An Englishman?'\n\n'Yes, I'm sure of it. Not that I've much to go on. He professed to\nknow very little English, and never spoke it, except a word or two\nnow and then to help me out of a sentence; and as to his German, he\nseemed to me to speak it like a native; but, of course, I'm no\njudge.' Davies sighed. 'That's where I wanted someone like you. You\nwould have spotted him at once, if he wasn't German. I go more by\na--what do you call it?--a----'\n\n'General impression,' I suggested.\n\n'Yes, that's what I mean. It was something in his looks and manner;\nyou know how different we are from foreigners. And it wasn't only\nhimself, it was the way he talked--I mean about cruising and the sea,\nespecially. It's true he let me do most of the talking; but, all the\nsame--how can I explain it? I felt we understood one another, in a\nway that two foreigners wouldn't.\n\n'He pretended to think me a bit crazy for coming so far in a small\nboat, but I could swear he knew as much about the game as I did; for\nlots of little questions he asked had the right ring in them. Mind\nyou, all this is an afterthought. I should never have bothered about\nit--I'm not cut out for a Sherlock Holmes--if it hadn't been for what\nfollowed.'\n\n'It's rather vague,' I said. 'Have you no more definite reason for\nthinking him English?'\n\n'There were one or two things rather more definite,' said Davies,\nslowly. 'You know when he hove to and hailed me, proposing the short\ncut, I told you roughly what he said. I forget the exact words, but\n\"abschneiden\" came in--\"durch Watten\" and \"abschneiden\" (they call\nthe banks \"watts\", you know); they were simple words, and he shouted\nthem loud, so as to carry through the wind. I understood what he\nmeant, but, as I told you, I hesitated before consenting. I suppose\nhe thought I didn't understand, for just as he was drawing ahead\nagain he pointed to the suth'ard, and then shouted through his hands\nas a trumpet \"Verstehen Sie? short-cut through sands: follow me!\" the\nlast two sentences in downright English. I can hear those words now,\nand I'll swear they were in his native tongue. Of course I thought\nnothing of it at the time. I was quite aware that he knew a few\nEnglish words, though he had always mispronounced them; an easy\ntrick when your hearer suspects nothing. But I needn't say that just\nthen I was observant of trifles. I don't pretend to be able to\nunravel a plot and steer a small boat before a heavy sea at the same\nmoment.'\n\n'And if he was piloting you into the next world he could afford to\ncommit himself before you parted! Was there anything else? By the\nway, how did the daughter strike you? Did she look English too?'\n\nTwo men cannot discuss a woman freely without a deep foundation of\nintimacy, and, until this day, the subject had never arisen between\nus in any form. It was the last that was likely to, for I could have\ndivined that Davies would have met it with an armour of reserve. He\nwas busy putting on this armour now; yet I could not help feeling a\nlittle brutal as I saw how badly he jointed his clumsy suit of mail.\nOur ages were the same, but I laugh now to think how old and _blas\u00c3\u00a9_\nI felt as the flush warmed his brown skin, and he slowly propounded\nthe verdict, 'Yes, I think she did.'\n\n'She _talked_ nothing but German, I suppose?'\n\n'Oh, of course.'\n\n'Did you see much of her?'\n\n'A good deal.'\n\n'Was she----,' (how frame it?) 'Did she want you to sail to the Elbe\nwith them?'\n\n'She seemed to,' admitted Davies, reluctantly, clutching at his ally,\nthe match-box. 'But, hang it, don't dream that she knew what was\ncoming,' he added, with sudden fire.\n\nI pondered and wondered, shrinking from further inquisition, easy as\nit would have been with so truthful a victim, and banishing all\nthought of ill-timed chaff. There was a cross-current in this strange\naffair, whose depth and strength I was beginning to gauge with\nincreasing seriousness. I did not know my man yet, and I did not know\nmyself. A conviction that events in the near future would force us\ninto complete mutual confidence withheld me from pressing him too\nfar. I returned to the main question; who was Dollmann, and what was\nhis motive? Davies struggled out of his armour.\n\n'I'm convinced,' he said, 'that he's an Englishman in German service.\nHe must be in German service, for he had evidently been in those\nwaters a long time, and knew every inch of them; of course, it's a\nvery lonely part of the world, but he has a house on Norderney\nIsland; and he, and all about him, must be well known to a certain\nnumber of people. One of his friends I happened to meet; what do you\nthink he was? A naval officer. It was on the afternoon of the third\nday, and we were having coffee on the deck of the 'Medusa', and talking\nabout next day's trip, when a little launch came buzzing up from\nseaward, drew alongside, and this chap I'm speaking of came on board,\nshook hands with Dollmann, and stared hard at me. Dollmann introduced\nus, calling him Commander von Br\u00c3\u00bcning, in command of the torpedo\ngunboat _Blitz_. He pointed towards Norderney, and I saw her--a low,\ngrey rat of a vessel--anchored in the Roads about two miles away. It\nturned out that she was doing the work of fishery guardship on that\npart of the coast.\n\n'I must say I took to him at once. He looked a real good sort, and a\nsplendid officer, too--just the sort of chap I should have liked to\nbe. You know I always wanted--but that's an old story, and can wait.\nI had some talk with him, and we got on capitally as far as we went,\nbut that wasn't far, for I left pretty soon, guessing that they\nwanted to be alone.'\n\n'_Were_ they alone then?' I asked, innocently.\n\n'Oh, Fr\u00c3\u00a4ulein Dollmann was there, of course,' explained Davies,\nfeeling for his armour again.\n\n'Did he seem to know them well?' I pursued, inconsequently.\n\n'Oh, yes, very well.'\n\nScenting a faint clue, I felt the need of feminine weapons for my\nsensitive antagonist. But the opportunity passed.\n\n'That was the last I saw of him,' he said. 'We sailed, as I told you,\nat daybreak next morning. Now, have you got any idea what I'm driving\nat?'\n\n'A rough idea,' I answered. 'Go ahead.'\n\nDavies sat up to the table, unrolled the chart with a vigorous sweep\nof his two hands, and took up his parable with new zest.\n\n'I start with two certainties,' he said. 'One is that I was \"moved\non\" from that coast, because I was too inquisitive. The other is that\nDollmann is at some devil's work there which is worth finding out.\nNow'--he paused in a gasping effort to be logical and articulate.\n'Now--well, look at the chart. No, better still, look first at this\nmap of Germany. It's on a small scale, and you can see the whole\nthing.' He snatched down a pocket-map from the shelf and unfolded it.\n_[See Map A]_ 'Here's this huge empire, stretching half over central\nEurope--an empire growing like wildfire, I believe, in people, and\nwealth, and everything. They've licked the French, and the Austrians,\nand are the greatest military power in Europe. I wish I knew more\nabout all that, but what I'm concerned with is their sea-power. It's\na new thing with them, but it's going strong, and that Emperor of\ntheirs is running it for all it's worth. He's a splendid chap, and\nanyone can see he's right. They've got no colonies to speak of, and\n_must_ have them, like us. They can't get them and keep them, and\nthey can't protect their huge commerce without naval strength. The\ncommand of the sea is _the_ thing nowadays, isn't it? I say, don't\nthink these are my ideas,' he added, na\u00c3\u00afvely. 'It's all out of Mahan\nand those fellows. Well, the Germans have got a small fleet at\npresent, but it's a thundering good one, and they're building hard.\nThere's the----and the----.' He broke off into a digression on armaments\nand speeds in which I could not follow him. He seemed to know every\nship by heart. I had to recall him to the point. 'Well, think of\nGermany as a new sea-power,' he resumed. 'The next thing is, what is\nher coast-line? It's a very queer one, as you know, split clean in\ntwo by Denmark, most of it lying east of that and looking on the\nBaltic, which is practically an inland sea, with its entrance blocked\nby Danish islands. It was to evade that block that William built the\nship canal from Kiel to the Elbe, but that could be easily smashed in\nwar-time. Far the most important bit of coast-line is that which lies\n_west_ of Denmark and looks on the North Sea. It's there that Germany\ngets her head out into the open, so to speak. It's there that she\nfronts us and France, the two great sea-powers of Western Europe, and\nit's there that her greatest ports are and her richest commerce.\n\n'Now it must strike you at once that it's ridiculously short compared\nwith the huge country behind it. From Borkum to the Elbe, as the crow\nflies, is only seventy miles. Add to that the west coast of\nSchleswig, say 120 miles. Total, say, two hundred. Compare that with\nthe seaboard of France and England. Doesn't it stand to reason that\nevery inch of it is important? Now what _sort_ of coast is it? Even\non this small map you can see at once, by all those wavy lines,\nshoals and sand everywhere, blocking nine-tenths of the land\naltogether, and doing their best to block the other tenth where the\ngreat rivers run in. Now let's take it bit by bit. You see it divides\nitself into three. Beginning from the west the _first piece_ is from\nBorkum to Wangeroog--fifty odd miles. What's that like? A string of\nsandy islands backed by sand; the Ems river at the western end, on\nthe Dutch border, leading to Emden--not much of a place. Otherwise,\nno coast towns at all. _Second piece:_ a deep sort of bay consisting\nof the three great estuaries--the Jade, the Weser and the\nElbe--leading to Wilhelmshaven (their North Sea naval base), Bremen,\nand Hamburg; total breadth of bay, twenty odd miles only; sandbanks\nlittered about all through it. _Third piece:_ the Schleswig coast,\nhopelessly fenced in behind a six to eight mile fringe of sand. No\nbig towns; one moderate river, the Eider. Let's leave that third\npiece aside. I may be wrong, but, in thinking this business out, I've\npegged away chiefly at the other two, the seventy-mile stretch from\nBorkum to the Elbe--half of it estuaries, and half islands. It was\nthere that I found the 'Medusa', and it's that stretch that, thanks to\nhim, I missed exploring.'\n\nI made an obvious conjecture. 'I suppose there are forts and coast\ndefences? Perhaps he thought you would see too much. By the way, he\nsaw your naval books, of course?'\n\n'Exactly. Of course that was my first idea; but it can't be that. It\ndoesn't explain things in the least. To begin with, there _are_ no\nforts and can be none in that first division, where the islands are.\nThere might be something on Borkum to defend the Ems; but it's very\nunlikely, and, anyway, I had passed Borkum and was at Norderney.\nThere's nothing else to defend. Of course it's different in the\nsecond division, where the big rivers are. There are probably hosts\nof forts and mines round Wilhelmshaven and Bremerhaven, and at\nCuxhaven just at the mouth of the Elbe. Not that I should ever dream\nof bothering about them; every steamer that goes in would see as much\nas me. Personally, I much prefer to stay on board, and don't often go\non shore. And, good Heavens!' (Davies leant back and laughed\njoyously) 'do I _look_ like that kind of spy?'\n\nI figured to myself one of those romantic gentlemen that one reads of\nin sixpenny magazines, with a Kodak in his tie-pin, a sketch-book in\nthe lining of his coat, and a selection of disguises in his hand\nluggage. Little disposed for merriment as I was, I could not help\nsmiling, too.\n\n'About this coast,' resumed Davies. 'In the event of war it seems to\nme that every inch of it would be important, _sand and all._ Take the\nbig estuaries first, which, of course, might be attacked or blockaded\nby an enemy. At first sight you would say that their main channels\nwere the only things that mattered. Now, in time of peace there's no\nsecrecy about the navigation of these. They're buoyed and lighted\nlike streets, open to the whole world, and taking an immense traffic;\nwell charted, too, as millions of pounds in commerce depend on them.\nBut now look at the sands they run through, intersected, as I showed\nyou, by threads of channels, tidal for the most part, and probably\nonly known to smacks and shallow coasters, like that galliot of\nBartels.\n\n'It strikes me that in a war a lot might depend on these, both in\ndefence and attack, for there's plenty of water in them at the right\ntide for patrol-boats and small torpedo craft, though I can see they\ntake a lot of knowing. Now, say _we_ were at war with Germany--both\nsides could use them as lines between the three estuaries; and to\ntake our own case, a small torpedo-boat (not a destroyer, mind you)\ncould on a dark night cut clean through from the Jade to the Elbe and\nplay the deuce with the shipping there. But the trouble is that I\ndoubt if there's a soul in our fleet who knows those channels. _We_\nhaven't coasters there; and, as to yachts, it's a most unlikely game\nfor an English yacht to play at; but it does so happen that I have a\nfancy for that sort of thing and would have explored those channels\nin the ordinary course.' I began to see his drift.\n\n'Now for the islands. I was rather stumped there at first, I grant,\nbecause, though there are lashings of sand behind them, and the same\nsort of intersecting channels, yet there seems nothing important to\nguard or attack.\n\n'Why shouldn't a stranger ramble as he pleases through them? Still\nDollmann had his headquarters there, and I was sure that had some\nmeaning. Then it struck me that the same point held good, for that\nstrip of Frisian coast adjoins the estuaries, and would also form a\nsplendid base for raiding midgets, which could travel unseen right\nthrough from the Ems to the Jade, and so to the Elbe, as by a covered\nway between a line of forts.\n\n'Now here again it's an unknown land to us. Plenty of local galliots\ntravel it, but strangers never, I should say. Perhaps at the most an\noccasional foreign yacht gropes in at one of the gaps between the\nislands for shelter from bad weather, and is precious lucky to get in\nsafe. Once again, it was my fad to like such places, and Dollmann\ncleared me out. He's not a German, but he's in with Germans, and\nnaval Germans too. He's established on that coast, and knows it by\nheart. And he tried to drown me. Now what do you think?' He gazed at\nme long and anxiously.\n\n\n\n\nIX. I Sign Articles\n\n\nIT was not an easy question to answer, for the affair was utterly\noutside all my experience; its background the sea, and its actual\nscene a region of the sea of which I was blankly ignorant. There were\nother difficulties that I could see perhaps better than Davies, an\nenthusiast with hobbies, who had been brooding in solitude over his\ndangerous adventure. Yet both narrative and theory (which have lost,\nI fear, in interpretation to the reader) had strongly affected me;\nhis forcible roughnesses, tricks of manner, sudden bursts of ardour,\nsudden retreats into shyness, making up a charm I cannot render. I\nfound myself continually trying to see the man through the boy, to\ndistinguish sober judgement from the hot-headed vagaries of youth.\nNot that I dreamed for a moment of dismissing the story of his wreck\nas an hallucination. His clear blue eyes and sane simplicity threw\nridicule on such treatment.\n\nEvidently, too, he wanted my help, a matter that might well have\ninfluenced my opinion on the facts, had he been other than he was.\nBut it would have taken a 'finished and finite clod' to resist the\nattraction of the man and the enterprise; and I take no credit\nwhatever for deciding to follow him, right or wrong. So, when I\nstated my difficulties, I knew very well that we should go.\n\n'There are two main points that I don't understand,' I said. 'First,\nyou've never explained why an _Englishman_ should be watching those\nwaters and ejecting intruders; secondly, your theory doesn't supply\nsufficient motive. There may be much in what you say about the\nnavigation of those channels, but it's not enough. You say he wanted\nto drown you--a big charge, requiring a big motive to support it. But\nI don't deny that you've got a strong case.' Davies lighted up. 'I'm\nwilling to take a good deal for granted--until we find out more.'\n\nHe jumped up, and did a thing I never saw him do before or\nsince--bumped his head against the cabin roof.\n\n'You mean that you'll come?' he exclaimed. 'Why, I hadn't even asked\nyou! Yes, I want to go back and clear up the whole thing. I know now\nthat I want to; telling it all to you has been such an immense\nrelief. And a lot depended on you, too, and that's why I've been\nfeeling such an absolute hypocrite. I say, how can I apologize?'\n\n'Don't worry about me; I've had a splendid time. And I'll come right\nenough; but I should like to know exactly what you----'\n\n'No; but wait till I just make a clean breast of it--about you, I\nmean. You see, I came to the conclusion that I could do nothing\nalone; not that two are really necessary for managing the boat in the\nordinary way, but for this sort of job you _do_ want two; besides, I\ncan't speak German properly, and I'm a dull chap all round. If my\ntheory, as you call it, is right, it's a case for sharp wits, if ever\nthere was one; so I thought of you. You're clever, and I knew you had\nlived in Germany and knew German, and I knew,' he added, with a\nlittle awkwardness, 'that you had done a good deal of yachting; but\nof course I ought to have told you what you were in for--roughing it\nin a small boat with no crew. I felt ashamed of myself when you wired\nback so promptly, and when you came--er----' Davies stammered and\nhesitated in the humane resolve not to wound my feelings. 'Of course\nI couldn't help noticing that it wasn't what you expected,' was the\ndelicate summary he arrived at. 'But you took it splendidly,' he\nhastened to add. 'Only, somehow, I couldn't bring myself to talk\nabout the plan. It was good enough of you to come out at all, without\nbothering you with hare-brained schemes. Beside, I wasn't even sure\nof myself. It's a tangled business. There were reasons, there are\nreasons still'--he looked nervously at me--'which--well, which make\nit a tangled business.' I had thought a confidence was coming, and\nwas disappointed. 'I was in an idiotic state of uncertainty,' he\nhurried on; 'but the plan grew on me more and more, when I saw how\nyou were taking to the life and beginning to enjoy yourself. All that\nabout the ducks on the Frisian coast was humbug; part of a stupid\nidea of decoying you there and gaining time. However, you quite\nnaturally objected, and last night I meant to chuck the whole thing\nup and give you the best time here I could. Then Bartels turned up----'\n\n'Stop,' I put in. 'Did you know he might turn up when you sailed\nhere?'\n\n'Yes,' said Davies, guiltily. 'I knew he might; and now it's all come\nout, and you'll come! What a fool I've been!'\n\nLong before he had finished I had grasped the whole meaning of the\nlast few days, and had read their meaning into scores of little\nincidents which had puzzled me.\n\n'For goodness' sake, don't apologize,' I protested. 'I could make\nconfessions, too, if I liked. And I doubt if you've been such a fool\nas you think. I'm a patient that wants careful nursing, and it has\nbeen the merest chance all through that I haven't rebelled and\nbolted. We've got a good deal to thank the weather for, and other\nlittle stimulants. And you don't know yet my reasons for deciding to\ntry your cure at all.'\n\n'My cure?' said Davies; 'what in the world do you mean? It was jolly\ndecent of you to----'\n\n'Never mind! There's another view of it, but it doesn't matter now.\nLet's return to the point. What's your plan of action?'\n\n'It's this,' was the prompt reply: 'to get back to the North Sea,\n_via_ Kiel and the ship canal. Then there will be two objects: one,\nto work back to Norderney, where I left off before, exploring all\nthose channels through the estuaries and islands; the other, to find\nDollmann, discover what he's up to, and settle with him. The two\nthings may overlap, we can't tell yet. I don't even know where he and\nhis yacht are; but I'll be bound they're somewhere in those same\nwaters, and probably back at Norderney.'\n\n'It's a delicate matter,' I mused, dubiously, 'if your theory's\ncorrect. Spying on a spy----'\n\n'It's not like that,' said Davies, indignantly. 'Anyone who likes can\nsail about there and explore those waters. I say, you don't really\nthink it's like that, do you?'\n\n'I don't think you're likely to do anything dishonourable,' I\nhastened to explain. 'I grant you the sea's public property in your\nsense. I only mean that developments are possible, which you don't\nreckon on. There _must_ be more to find out than the mere navigation\nof those channels, and if that's so, mightn't we come to be genuine\nspies ourselves?'\n\n'And, after all, hang it!' exclaimed Davies, 'if it comes to that,\nwhy shouldn't we? I look at it like this. The man's an Englishman,\nand if he's in with Germany he's a traitor to us, and we as\nEnglishmen have a right to expose him. If we can't do it without\nspying we've a right to spy, at our own risk----'\n\n'There's a stronger argument than that. He tried to take your life.'\n\n'I don't care a rap about that. I'm not such an ass as to thirst for\nrevenge and all that, like some chap in a shilling shocker. But it\nmakes me wild to think of that fellow masquerading as a German, and\nup to who knows what mischief--mischief enough to make him want to\nget rid of _any_ one. I'm keen about the sea, and I think they're apt\nto be a bit slack at home,' he continued inconsequently. 'Those\nAdmiralty chaps want waking up. Anyway, as far as I'm concerned, it's\nquite natural that I should look him up again.'\n\n'Quite,' I agreed; 'you parted friends, and they may be delighted to\nsee you. You'll have plenty to talk about.'\n\n'H'm,' said Davies, withered into silence by the 'they'. 'Hullo! I\nsay, do you know it's three o'clock? How the time has gone! And, by\nJove! I believe the fog's lifting.'\n\nI returned, with a shock, to the present, to the weeping walls, the\ndiscoloured deal table, the ghastly breakfast litter--all the visible\nsymbols of the life I had pledged myself to. Disillusionment was\nmaking rapid headway when Davies returned, and said, with energy:\n\n'What do you say to starting for Kiel at once? The fog's going, and\nthere's a breeze from the sou'-west.'\n\n'Now?' I protested. 'Why, it'll mean sailing all night, won't it?'\n\n'Oh, no,' said Davies. 'Not with luck.'\n\n'Why, it's dark at seven!'\n\n'Yes, but it's only twenty-five miles. I know it's not exactly a fair\nwind, but we shall lie closehauled most of the way. The glass is\nfalling, and we ought to take this chance.'\n\nTo argue about winds with Davies was hopeless, and the upshot was\nthat we started lunchless. A pale sun was flickering out of masses of\nracing vapour, and through delicate vistas between them the fair land\nof Schleswig now revealed and now withdrew her pretty face, as though\nsmiling _adieux_ to her faithless courtiers.\n\nThe clank of our chain brought up Bartels to the deck of the\n'Johannes', rubbing his eyes and pulling round his throat a grey shawl,\nwhich gave him a comical likeness to a lodging-house landlady\nreceiving the milk in morning _d\u00c3\u00a9shabill\u00c3\u00a9._\n\n'We're off, Bartels,' said Davies, without looking up from his work.\n'See you at Kiel, I hope.'\n\n'You are always in a hurry, captain,' bleated the old man, shaking\nhis head. 'You should wait till to-morrow. The sky is not good, and\nit will be dark before you are off Eckenf\u00c3\u00b6rde.'\n\nDavies laughed, and very soon his mentor's sad little figure was lost\nin haze.\n\nThat was a curious evening. Dusk soon fell, and the devil made a\ndetermined effort to unman me; first, with the scrambled tea which\nwas the tardy substitute for an orderly lunch, then with the new and\nnauseous duty of filling the side-lights, which meant squatting in\nthe fo'c'sle to inhale paraffin and dabble in lamp-black; lastly,\nwith an all-round attack on my nerves as the night fell on our frail\nlittle vessel, pitching on her precarious way through driving mist.\nIn a sense I think I went through the same sort of mental crisis as\nwhen I sat upon my portmanteau at Flensburg. The main issue was not\nseriously in question, for I had signed on in the _Dulcibella_ for good\nor ill; but in doing so I had outrun myself, and still wanted an\noutlook, a mood suited to the enterprise, proof against petty\ndiscouragements. Not for the first time a sense of the ludicrous came\nto my assistance, as I saw myself fretting in London under my burden\nof self-imposed woes, nicely weighing that insidious invitation, and\nstepping finally into the snare with the dignity due to my\nimportance; kidnapped as neatly as ever a peaceful clerk was\nkidnapped by a lawless press-gang, and, in the end, finding as the\narch-conspirator a guileless and warm-hearted friend, who called me\nclever, lodged me in a cell, and blandly invited me to talk German to\nthe purpose, as he was aiming at a little secret service on the high\nseas. Close in the train of Humour came Romance, veiling her face,\nbut I knew it was the rustle of her robes that I heard in the foam\nbeneath me; I knew that it was she who handed me the cup of sparkling\nwine and bade me drink and be merry. Strange to me though it was, I\nknew the taste when it touched my lips. It was not that bastard\nconcoction I had tasted in the pseudo-Bohemias of Soho; it was not\nthe showy but insipid beverage I should have drunk my fill of at\nMorven Lodge; it was the purest of her pure vintages, instilling the\nancient inspiration which, under many guises, quickens thousands of\nbetter brains than mine, but whose essence is always the same; the\ngay pursuit of a perilous quest. Then and there I tried to clinch the\nmatter and keep that mood. In the main I think I succeeded, though I\nhad many lapses.\n\nFor the present my veins tingled with the draught. The wind humming\ninto the mainsail, the ghostly wave-crests riding up out of the void,\nwhispered a low thrilling chorus in praise of adventure. Potent\nindeed must the spell have been, for, in reality, that first night\nsail teemed with terrors for me. It is true that it began well, for\nthe haze dispersed, as Davies had prophesied, and Bulk Point\nLighthouse guided us safely to the mouth of Kiel Fiord. It was during\nthis stage that, crouching together aft, our pipe-bowls glowing\nsympathetically, we returned to the problem before us; for we had\nshot out on our quest with volcanic precipitation, leaving much to be\ndiscussed. I gleaned a few more facts, though I dispelled no doubts.\nDavies had only seen the Dollmanns on their yacht, where father and\ndaughter were living for the time. Their villa at Norderney, and\ntheir home life there, were unknown to him, though he had landed once\nat the harbour himself. Further, he had heard vaguely of a\nstepmother, absent at Hamburg. They were to have joined her on their\narrival at that city, which, be it noted, stands a long way up the\nElbe, forty miles and more above Cuxhaven, the town at the mouth.\n\nThe exact arrangement made on the day before the fatal voyage was\nthat the two yachts should meet in the evening at Cuxhaven and\nproceed up the river together. Then, in the ordinary course, Davies\nwould have parted company at Brunsb\u00c3\u00bcttel (fifteen miles up), which is\nthe western terminus of the ship canal to the Baltic. Such at least\nhad been his original intention; but, putting two and two together, I\ngathered that latterly, and perhaps unconfessed to himself, his\nresolve had weakened, and that he would have followed the 'Medusa' to\nHamburg, or indeed the end of the world, impelled by the same motive\nthat, contrary to all his tastes and principles, had induced him to\nabandon his life in the islands and undertake the voyage at all. But\non that point he was immovably reticent, and all I could conclude was\nthat the strange cross-current connected with Dollmann's daughter had\ngiven him cruel pain and had clouded his judgement to distraction,\nbut that he now was prepared to forget or ignore it, and steer a\nsettled course.\n\nThe facts I elicited raised several important questions. Was it not\nknown by this time that he and his yacht had survived? Davies was\nconvinced that it was not. 'He may have waited at Cuxhaven, or\ninquired at the lock at Brunsb\u00c3\u00bcttel,' he said. 'But there was no\nneed, for I tell you the thing was a certainty. If I had struck and\n_stuck_ on that outer bank, as it was a hundred to one I should do,\nthe yacht would have broken up in three minutes. Bartels would never\nhave seen me, and couldn't have got to me if he had. No one would\nhave seen me. And nothing whatever has happened since to show that\nthey know I'm alive.'\n\n'They,' I suggested. 'Who are \"they\"? Who are our adversaries?' If\nDollmann were an accredited agent of the German Admiralty---- But, no,\nit was incredible that the murder of a young Englishman should be\nconnived at in modern days by a friendly and civilized government!\nYet, if he were not such an agent, the whole theory fell to the\nground.\n\n'I believe,' said Davies, 'that Dollmann did it off his own bat, and\nbeyond that I can't see. And I don't know that it matters at present.\nAlive or dead we're doing nothing wrong, and have nothing to be\nashamed of.'\n\n'I think it matters a good deal,' I objected. 'Who will be interested\nin our resurrection, and how are we to go to work, openly or\nsecretly? I suppose we shall keep out of the way as much as we can?'\n\n'As for keeping out of the way,' said Davies, jerkily, as he peered\nto windward under the foresail, 'we _must_ pass the ship canal;\nthat's a public highway, where anyone can see you. After that there\nwon't be much difficulty. Wait till you see the place!' He gave a\nlow, contented laugh, which would have frozen my marrow yesterday.\n'By the way, that reminds me,' he added; 'we must stop at Kiel for\nthe inside of a day and lay in a lot of stores. We want to be\nindependent of the shore.' I said nothing. Independence of the shore\nin a seven-tonner in October! What an end to aim at!\n\nAbout nine o'clock we weathered the point, entered Kiel Fiord, and\nbegan a dead beat to windward of seven miles to the head of it where\nKiel lies. Hitherto, save for the latent qualms concerning my total\nhelplessness if anything happened to Davies, interest and excitement\nhad upheld me well. My alarms only began when I thought them nearly\nover. Davies had frequently urged me to turn in and sleep, and I went\nso far as to go below and coil myself up on the lee sofa with my\npencil and diary. Suddenly there was a flapping and rattling on deck,\nand I began to slide on to the floor. 'What's happened?' I cried, in\na panic, for there was Davies stooping in at the cabin door.\n\n'Nothing,' he said, chafing his hands for warmth; 'I'm only going\nabout. Hand me the glasses, will you? There's a steamer ahead. I say,\nif you really don't want to turn in, you might make some soup. Just\nlet's look at the chart.' He studied it with maddening deliberation,\nwhile I wondered how near the steamer was, and what the yacht was\ndoing meanwhile.\n\n'I suppose it's not really necessary for anyone to be at the helm?' I\nremarked.\n\n'Oh, she's all right for a minute,' he said, without looking up.\n'Two--one and a half--one--lights in line sou'-west by west--got a\nmatch?' He expended two, and tumbled upstairs again.\n\n'You don't want me, do you?' I shouted after him.\n\n'No, but come up when you've put the kettle on. It's a pretty beat up\nthe fiord. Lovely breeze.'\n\nHis legs disappeared. A sort of buoyant fatalism possessed me as I\nfinished my notes and pored over the stove. It upheld me, too, when I\nwent on deck and watched the 'pretty beat', whose prettiness was\nmainly due to the crowd of fog-bound shipping--steamers, smacks, and\nsailing-vessels--now once more on the move in the confined fairway of\nthe fiord, their baleful eyes of red, green, or yellow, opening and\nshutting, brightening and fading; while shore-lights and\nanchor-lights added to my bewilderment, and a throbbing of screws\nfilled the air like the distant roar of London streets. In fact,\nevery time we spun round for our dart across the fiord I felt like a\nrustic matron gathering her skirts for the transit of the Strand on a\nbusy night. Davies, however, was the street arab who zigzags under\nthe horses' feet unscathed; and all the time he discoursed placidly\non the simplicity and safety of night-sailing if only you are\ncareful, obeying rules, and burnt good lights. As we were nearing the\nhot glow in the sky that denoted Kiel we passed a huge scintillating\nbulk moored in mid-stream. 'Warships,' he murmured, ecstatically.\n\nAt one o'clock we anchored off the town.\n\n\n\n\nX. His Chance\n\n\n'I SAY, Davies,' I said, 'how long do you think this trip will last?\nI've only got a month's leave.'\n\nWe were standing at slanting desks in the Kiel post-office, Davies\nscratching diligently at his letter-card, and I staring feebly at\nmine.\n\n'By Jove!' said Davies, with a start of dismay; 'that's only three\nweeks more; I never thought of that. You couldn't manage to get an\nextension, could you?'\n\n'I can write to the chief,' I admitted; 'but where's the answer to\ncome to? We're better without an address, I suppose.'\n\n'There's Cuxhaven,' reflected Davies; 'but that's too near, and\nthere's--but we don't want to be tied down to landing anywhere. I\ntell you what: say \"Post Office, Norderney\", just your name, not the\nyacht's. We _may_ get there and be able to call for letters.' The\ncasual character of our adventure never struck me more strongly than\nthen.\n\n'Is that what _you're_ doing?' I asked.\n\n'Oh, I shan't be having important letters like you.'\n\n'But what are you saying?'\n\n'Oh, just that we're having a splendid cruise, and are on our way\nhome.'\n\nThe notion tickled me, and I said the same in my home letter, adding\nthat we were looking for a friend of Davies's who would be able to\nshow us some sport. I wrote a line, too, to my chief (unaware of the\ngravity of the step I was taking) saying it was possible that I might\nhave to apply for longer leave, as I had important business to\ntransact in Germany, and asking him kindly to write to the same\naddress. Then we shouldered our parcels and resumed our business.\n\nTwo full dinghy-loads of stores we ferried to the _Dulcibella_, chief\namong which were two immense cans of petroleum, constituting our\nreserves of heat and light, and a sack of flour. There were spare\nropes and blocks, too; German charts of excellent quality; cigars and\nmany weird brands of sausage and tinned meats, besides a miscellany\nof oddments, some of which only served in the end to slake my\ncompanion's craving for jettison. Clothes were my own chief care,\nfor, freely as I had purged it at Flensburg, my wardrobe was still\nvery unsuitable, and I had already irretrievably damaged two\nfaultless pairs of white flannels. ('We shall be able to throw them\noverboard,' said Davies, hopefully.) So I bought a great pair of\nseaboots of the country, felt-lined and wooden-soled, and both of us\ngot a number of rough woollen garments (as worn by the local\nfishermen), breeches, jerseys, helmets, gloves; all of a colour\nchosen to harmonize with paraffin stains and anchor mud.\n\nThe same evening we were taking our last look at the Baltic, sailing\npast warships and groups of idle yachts battened down for their\nwinter's sleep; while the noble shores of the fiord, with its villas\nembowered in copper foliage, grew dark and dim above us.\n\nWe rounded the last headland, steered for a galaxy of coloured\nlights, tumbled down our sails, and came to under the colossal gates\nof the Holtenau lock. That these would open to such an infinitesimal\nsuppliant seemed inconceivable. But open they did, with ponderous\nmajesty, and our tiny hull was lost in the womb of a lock designed to\nfloat the largest battleships. I thought of Boulter's on a hot August\nSunday, and wondered if I really was the same peevish dandy who had\njostled and sweltered there with the noisy cockney throng a month\nago. There was a blaze of electricity overhead, but utter silence\ntill a solitary cloaked figure hailed us and called for the captain.\nDavies ran up a ladder, disappeared with the cloaked figure, and\nreturned crumpling a paper into his pocket. It lies before me now,\nand sets forth, under the stamp of the K\u00c3\u00b6nigliches Zollamt, that, in\nconsideration of the sum of ten marks for dues and four for tonnage,\nan imperial tug would tow the vessel _Dulcibella_ (master A. H. Davies)\nthrough the Kaiser Wilhelm canal from Holtenau to Brunsb\u00c3\u00bcttel.\nMagnificent condescension! I blush when I look at this yellow\ndocument and remember the stately courtesy of the great lock-gates;\nfor the sleepy officials of the K\u00c3\u00b6nigliches Zollamt little knew what\nan insidious little viper they were admitting into the imperial bosom\nat the light toll of fourteen shillings.\n\n'Seems cheap,' said Davies, joining me, 'doesn't it? They've a\nregular tariff on tonnage, same for yachts as for liners. We start at\nfour to-morrow with a lot of other boats. I wonder if Bartels is\nhere.'\n\nThe same silence reigned, but invisible forces were at work. The\ninner gates opened and we prised ourselves through into a capacious\nbasin, where lay moored side by side a flotilla of sailing vessels of\nvarious sizes. Having made fast alongside a vacant space of quay, we\nhad our dinner, and then strolled out with cigars to look for the\n'Johannes'. We found her wedged among a stack of galliots, and her\nskipper sitting primly below before a blazing stove, reading his\nBible through spectacles. He produced a bottle of schnapps and some\nvery small and hard pears, while Davies twitted him mercilessly about\nhis false predictions.\n\n'The sky was not good,' was all he said, beaming indulgently at his\nincorrigible young friend.\n\nBefore parting for the night it was arranged that next morning we\nshould lash alongside the 'Johannes' when the flotilla was marshalled\nfor the tow through the canal.\n\n'Karl shall steer for us both,' he said, 'and we will stay warm in\nthe cabin.'\n\nThe scheme was carried out, not without much confusion and loss of\npaint, in the small hours of a dark and drizzling morning. Boisterous\nlittle tugs sorted us into parties, and half lost under the massive\nbulwarks of the 'Johannes' we were carried off into a black inane. If\nany doubt remained as to the significance of our change of\ncruising-grounds, dawn dispelled it. View there was none from the\ndeck of the _Dulcibella_; it was only by standing on the mainboom that\nyou could see over the embankments to the vast plain of Holstein,\ngrey and monotonous under a pall of mist. The soft scenery of the\nSchleswig coast was a baseless dream of the past, and a cold\npenetrating rain added the last touch of dramatic completeness to the\nstaging of the new act.\n\nFor two days we travelled slowly up the mighty waterway that is the\nstrategic link between the two seas of Germany. Broad and straight,\nmassively embanked, lit by electricity at night till it is lighter\nthan many a great London street; traversed by great war vessels, rich\nmerchantmen, and humble coasters alike, it is a symbol of the new and\nmighty force which, controlled by the genius of statesmen and\nengineers, is thrusting the empire irresistibly forward to the goal\nof maritime greatness.\n\n'Isn't it splendid?' said Davies. 'He's a fine fellow, that emperor.'\n\nKarl was the shock-headed, stout-limbed boy of about sixteen, who\nconstituted the whole crew of the 'Johannes', and was as dirty as his\nmaster was clean. I felt a certain envious reverence for this\nunprepossessing youth, seeing in him a much more efficient\ncounterpart of myself; but how he and his little master ever managed\nto work their ungainly vessel was a miracle I never understood.\nPhlegmatically impervious to rain and cold, he steered the 'Johannes'\ndown the long grey reaches in the wake of the tug, while we and\nBartels held snug gatherings down below, sometimes in his cabin,\nsometimes in ours. The heating arrangements of the latter began to be\na subject of serious concern. We finally did the only logical thing,\nand brought the kitchen-range into the parlour, fixing the\nRippingille stove on the forward end of the cabin table, where it\ncould warm as well as cook for us. As an ornament it was monstrous,\nand the taint of oil which it introduced was a disgusting drawback;\nbut, after all, the great thing--as Davies said--is to be\ncomfortable, and after that to be clean.\n\nDavies held long consultations with Bartels, who was thoroughly at\nhome in the navigation of the sands we were bound for, his own boat\nbeing a type of the very craft which ply in them. I shall not forget\nthe moment when it first dawned on him that his young friend's\ncuriosity was practical; for he had thought that our goal was his own\nbeloved Hamburg, queen of cities, a place to see and die.\n\n'It is too late,' he wailed. 'You do not know the Nord See as I do.'\n\n'Oh, nonsense, Bartels, it's quite safe.'\n\n'Safe! And have I not found you fast on Hohenh\u00c3\u00b6rn, in a storm, with\nyour rudder broken? God was good to you then, my son.'\n\n'Yes, but it wasn't my f----' Davies checked himself. 'We're going\nhome. There's nothing in that.' Bartels became sadly resigned.\n\n'It is good that you have a friend,' was his last word on the\nsubject; but all the same he always glanced at me with a rather\ndoubtful eye. As to Davies and myself, our friendship developed\nquickly on certain limited lines, the chief obstacle, as I well know\nnow, being his reluctance to talk about the personal side of our\nquest.\n\nOn the other hand, I spoke about my own life and interests, with an\nunsparing discernment, of which I should have been incapable a month\nago, and in return I gained the key to his own character. It was\ndevotion to the sea, wedded to a fire of pent-up patriotism\nstruggling incessantly for an outlet in strenuous physical\nexpression; a humanity, born of acute sensitiveness to his own\nlimitations, only adding fuel to the flame. I learnt for the first\ntime now that in early youth he had failed for the navy, the first of\nseveral failures in his career. 'And I can't settle down to anything\nelse,' he said. 'I read no end about it, and yet I am a useless\noutsider. All I've been able to do is to potter about in small boats;\nbut it's all been _wasted_ till this chance came. I'm afraid you'll\nnot understand how I feel about it; but at last, for once in a way, I\nsee a chance of being useful.'\n\n'There ought to be chances for chaps like you,' I said, 'without the\naccident of a job such as this.'\n\n'Oh, as long as I get it, what matter? But I know what you mean.\nThere must be hundreds of chaps like me--I know a good many\nmyself--who know our coasts like a book--shoals, creeks, tides,\nrocks; there's nothing in it, it's only practice. They ought to make\nsome use of us as a naval reserve. They tried to once, but it fizzled\nout, and nobody really cares. And what's the result? Using every man\nof what reserves we've got, there's about enough to man the fleet on\na war footing, and no more. They've tinkered with fishermen, and\nmerchant sailors, and yachting hands, but everyone of them ought to\nbe got hold of; and the colonies, too. Is there the ghost of a doubt\nthat if war broke out there'd be wild appeals for volunteers, aimless\ncadging, hurry, confusion, waste? My own idea is that we ought to go\nmuch further, and train every able-bodied man for a couple of years\nas a sailor. Army? Oh, I suppose you'd have to give them the choice.\nNot that I know or care much about the Army, though to listen to\npeople talk you'd think it really mattered as the Navy matters. We're\na maritime nation--we've grown by the sea and live by it; if we lose\ncommand of it we starve. We're unique in that way, just as our huge\nempire, only linked by the sea, is unique. And yet, read Brassey,\nDilke, and those _Naval Annuals_, and see what mountains of apathy\nand conceit have had to be tackled. It's not the people's fault.\nWe've been safe so long, and grown so rich, that we've forgotten what\nwe owe it to. But there's no excuse for those blockheads of\nstatesmen, as they call themselves, who are paid to see things as\nthey are. They have to go to an American to learn their A B C, and\nit's only when kicked and punched by civilian agitators, a mere\nhandful of men who get sneered at for their pains, that they wake up,\ndo some work, point proudly to it, and go to sleep again, till they\nget another kick. By Jove! we want a man like this Kaiser, who\ndoesn't wait to be kicked, but works like a nigger for his country,\nand sees ahead.'\n\n'We're improving, aren't we?'\n\n'Oh, of course, we are! But it's a constant uphill fight; and we\naren't ready. They talk of a two-power standard----' He plunged away\ninto regions where space forbids me to follow him. This is only a\nsample of many similar conversations that we afterwards held, always\nculminating in the burning question of Germany. Far from including me\nand the Foreign Office among his targets for vague invective, he had\na profound respect for my sagacity and experience as a member of that\ninstitution; a respect which embarrassed me not a little when I\nthought of my _pr\u00c3\u00a9cis_ writing and cigarette-smoking, my dancing, and\nmy dining. But I did know something of Germany, and could satisfy his\ntireless questioning with a certain authority. He used to listen rapt\nwhile I described her marvellous awakening in the last generation,\nunder the strength and wisdom of her rulers; her intense patriotic\nardour; her seething industrial activity, and, most potent of all,\nthe forces that are moulding modern Europe, her dream of a colonial\nempire, entailing her transformation from a land-power to a\nsea-power. Impregnably based on vast territorial resources which we\ncannot molest, the dim instincts of her people, not merely directed\nbut anticipated by the genius of her ruling house, our great trade\nrivals of the present, our great naval rival of the future, she\ngrows, and strengthens, and waits, an ever more formidable factor in\nthe future of our delicate network of empire, sensitive as gossamer\nto external shocks, and radiating from an island whose commerce is\nits life, and which depends even for its daily ration of bread on the\nfree passage of the seas.\n\n'And we aren't ready for her,' Davies would say; 'we don't look her\nway. We have no naval base in the North Sea, and no North Sea Fleet.\nOur best battleships are too deep in draught for North Sea work. And,\nto crown all, we were asses enough to give her Heligoland, which\ncommands her North Sea coast. And supposing she collars Holland;\nisn't there some talk of that?'\n\nThat would lead me to describe the swollen ambitions of the\nPan-Germanic party, and its ceaseless intrigues to promote the\nabsorption of Austria, Switzerland, and--a direct and flagrant menace\nto ourselves--of Holland.\n\n'I don't blame them,' said Davies, who, for all his patriotism, had\nnot a particle of racial spleen in his composition. 'I don't blame\nthem; their Rhine ceases to be German just when it begins to be most\nvaluable. The mouth is Dutch, and would give them magnificent ports\njust opposite British shores. _We_ can't talk about conquest and\ngrabbing. We've collared a fine share of the world, and they've every\nright to be jealous. Let them hate us, and say so; it'll teach us to\nbuck up; and that's what really matters.'\n\nIn these talks there occurred a singular contact of minds. It was\nvery well for me to spin sonorous generalities, but I had never till\nnow dreamed of being so vulgar as to translate them into practice. I\nhad always detested the meddlesome alarmist, who veils ignorance\nunder noisiness, and for ever wails his chant of lugubrious\npessimism. To be thrown with Davies was to receive a shock of\nenlightenment; for here, at least, was a specimen of the breed who\nexacted respect. It is true he made use of the usual jargon,\ninterlarding his stammering sentences (sometimes, when he was\nexcited, with the oddest effect) with the conventional catchwords of\nthe journalist and platform speaker. But these were but accidents;\nfor he seemed to have caught his innermost conviction from the very\nsoul of the sea itself. An armchair critic is one thing, but a\nsunburnt, brine-burnt zealot smarting under a personal discontent,\nathirst for a means, however tortuous, of contributing his effort to\nthe great cause, the maritime supremacy of Britain, that was quite\nanother thing. He drew inspiration from the very wind and spray. He\ncommuned with his tiller, I believe, and marshalled his figures with\nits help. To hear him talk was to feel a current of clarifying air\nblustering into a close club-room, where men bandy ineffectual\nplatitudes, and mumble old shibboleths, and go away and do nothing.\n\nIn our talk about policy and strategy we were Bismarcks and Rodneys,\nwielding nations and navies; and, indeed, I have no doubt that our\nfancy took extravagant flights sometimes. In plain fact we were\nmerely two young gentlemen in a seven-ton pleasure boat, with a taste\nfor amateur hydrography and police duty combined. Not that Davies\never doubted. Once set on the road he gripped his purpose with\nchild-like faith and tenacity. It was his 'chance'.\n\n\n\n\nXI. The Pathfinders\n\n\nIN the late afternoon of the second day our flotilla reached the Elbe\nat Brunsb\u00c3\u00bcttel and ranged up in the inner basin, while a big liner,\nwhimpering like a fretful baby, was tenderly nursed into the lock.\nDuring the delay Davies left me in charge, and bolted off with an\noil-can and a milk-jug. An official in uniform was passing along the\nquay from vessel to vessel countersigning papers. I went up to meet\nhim with our receipt for dues, which he signed carelessly. Then he\npaused and muttered _'Dooltzhibella,'_ scratching his head, 'that was\nthe name. English?' he asked.\n\n'Yes.'\n\n'Little _lust-cutter_, that is so; there was an inquiry for you.'\n\n'Whom from?'\n\n'A friend of yours from a big barge-yacht.'\n\n'Oh, I know; she went on to Hamburg, I suppose?'\n\n'No such luck, captain; she was outward bound.'\n\nWhat did the man mean? He seemed to be vastly amused by something.\n\n'When was this--about three weeks ago?' I asked, indifferently.\n\n'Three weeks? It was the day before yesterday. What a pity to miss\nhim by so little!' He chuckled and winked.\n\n'Did he leave any message?' I asked.\n\n'It was a lady who inquired,' whispered the fellow, sniggering. 'Oh,\nreally,' I said, beginning to feel highly absurd, but keenly curious.\n'And she inquired about the _Dulcibella_?'\n\n'Herrgott! she was difficult to satisfy! Stood over me while I\nsearched the books. \"A very little one,\" she kept saying, and \"Are\nyou sure all the names are here?\" I saw her into her kleine Boot, and\nshe rowed away in the rain. No, she left no message. It was dirty\nweather for a young Fr\u00c3\u00a4ulein to be out alone in. Ach! she was safe\nenough, though. To see her crossing the ebb in a chop of tide was a\ntreat.'\n\n'And the yacht went on down the river? Where was she bound to?'\n\n'How do I know? Bremen, Wilhelmshaven, Emden--somewhere in the North\nSea; too far for you.'\n\n'I don't know about that,' said I, bravely.\n\n'Ach! you will not follow in _that_? Are not you bound to Hamburg?'\n\n'We can change our plans. It seems a pity to have missed them.'\n\n'Think twice, captain, there are plenty of pretty girls in Hamburg.\nBut you English will do anything. Well, viel Gl\u00c3\u00bcck!'\n\nHe moved on, chuckling, to the next boat. Davies soon returned with\nhis cans and an armful of dark, rye loaves, just in time, for, the\nliner being through, the flotilla was already beginning to jostle\ninto the lock and Bartels was growing impatient.\n\n'They'll last ten days,' he said, as we followed the throng, still\nclinging like a barnacle to the side of the 'Johannes'. We spent the\nfew minutes while the lock was emptied in a farewell talk to Bartels.\nKarl had hitched their main halyards on to the windlass and was\ngrinding at it in an _acharnement_ of industry, his shock head\njerking and his grubby face perspiring. Then the lock-gates opened;\nand so, in a Babel of shouting, whining of blocks, and creaking of\nspars, our whole company was split out into the dingy bosom of the\nElbe. The 'Johannes' gathered way under wind and tide and headed for\nmidstream. A last shake of the hand, and Bartels reluctantly slipped\nthe head-rope and we drifted apart. 'Gute Reise! Gute Reise!' It was\nno time for regretful gazing, for the flood-tide was sweeping us up\nand out, and it was not until we had set the foresail, edged into a\nshallow bight, and let go our anchor, that we had leisure to think of\nhim again; but by that time his and the other craft were shades in\nthe murky east.\n\nWe swung close to a _glacis_ of smooth blue mud which sloped up to a\nweed-grown dyke; behind lay the same flat country, colourless, humid;\nand opposite us, two miles away, scarcely visible in the deepening\ntwilight, ran the outline of a similar shore. Between rolled the\nturgid Elbe. 'The Styx flowing through Tartarus,' I thought to\nmyself, recalling some of our Baltic anchorages.\n\nI told my news to Davies as soon as the anchor was down,\ninstinctively leaving the sex of the inquirer to the last, as my\ninformant had done.\n\n'The 'Medusa' called yesterday?' he interrupted. 'And outward bound?\nThat's a rum thing. Why didn't he inquire when he was going _up_?'\n\n'It was a lady,' and I drily retailed the official's story, very busy\nwith a deck-broom the while. 'We're all square now, aren't we?' I\nended. 'I'll go below and light the stove.'\n\nDavies had been engaged in fixing up the riding-light. When I last\nsaw him he was still so engaged, but motionless, the lantern under\nhis left arm and his right hand grasping the forestay and the\nhalf-knotted lanyard; his eyes staring fixedly down the river, a\nstrange look in his face, half exultant, half perplexed. When he\njoined me and spoke he seemed to be concluding a difficult argument.\n\n'Anyway, it proves,' he said, 'that the 'Medusa' has gone back to\nNorderney. That's the main thing.'\n\n'Probably,' I agreed, 'but let's sum up all we know. First, it's\ncertain that nobody we've met as yet has any suspicion of _us_----'\n\n'I told you he did it off his own bat,' threw in Davies.\n\n'Or, secondly, of _him._ If he's what you think it's not known here.'\n\n'I can't help that.'\n\n'Thirdly, he inquires for you on his way _back_ from Hamburg, three\nweeks after the event. It doesn't look as if he thought he had\ndisposed of you--it doesn't look as if he had _meant_ to dispose of\nyou. He sends his daughter, too: a curious proceeding under the\ncircumstances. Perhaps it's all a mistake.'\n\n'It's not a mistake,' said Davies, half to himself. 'But _did_ he\nsend her? He'd have sent one of his men. He can't be on board at\nall.'\n\nThis was a new light.\n\n'What do you mean?' I asked.\n\n'He must have left the yacht when he got to Hamburg; some other\ndevil's work, I suppose. She's being sailed back now, and passing\nhere----'\n\n'Oh, I see! It's a private supplementary inquiry.'\n\n'That's a long name to call it.'\n\n'Would the girl sail back alone with the crew?'\n\n'She's used to the sea--and perhaps she isn't alone. There was that\nstepmother---- But it doesn't make a ha'porth of difference to our\nplans; we'll start on the ebb to-morrow morning.'\n\nWe were busier than usual that night, reckoning stores, tidying\nlockers, and securing movables. 'We must economize,' said Davies, for\nall the world as though we were castaways on a raft. 'It's a wretched\nthing to have to land somewhere to buy oil,' was a favourite\nobservation of his.\n\nBefore getting to sleep I was made to recognize a new factor in the\nconditions of navigation, now that the tideless Baltic was left\nbehind us. A strong current was sluicing past our sides, and at the\neleventh hour I was turned out, clad in pyjamas and oilskins (a\nhorrible combination), to assist in running out a kedge or spare\nanchor.\n\n'What's kedging-off?' I asked, when we were tucked up again. 'Oh,\nit's when you run aground; you have to--but you'll soon learn all\nabout it.' I steeled my heart for the morrow.\n\nSo behold us, then, at eight o'clock on October 5, standing down\nthe river towards the field of our first labours. It is fifteen miles\nto the mouth; drab, dreary miles like the dullest reaches of the\nlower Thames; but scenery was of no concern to us, and a\nsouth-westerly breeze blowing out of a grey sky kept us constantly on\nthe verge of reefing. The tide as it gathered strength swept us down\nwith a force attested by the speed with which buoys came in sight,\nnodded above us and passed, each boiling in its eddy of dirty foam. I\nscarcely noticed at first--so calm was the water, and so regular were\nthe buoys, like milestones along a road--that the northern line of\ncoast was rapidly receding and that the 'river' was coming to be but\na belt of deep water skirting a vast estuary, three--seven--ten miles\nbroad, till it merged in open sea.\n\n'Why, we're at sea!' I suddenly exclaimed, 'after an hour's sailing!'\n\n'Just discovered that?' said Davies, laughing.\n\n'You said it was fifteen miles,' I complained.\n\n'So it is, till we reach this coast at Cuxhaven; but I suppose you\nmay say we're at sea; of course that's all sand over there to\nstarboard. Look! some of it's showing already.'\n\nHe pointed into the north. Looking more attentively I noticed that\noutside the line of buoys patches of the surface heaved and worked;\nin one or two places streaks and circles of white were forming; in\nthe midst of one such circle a sleek mauve hump had risen, like the\nback of a sleeping whale. I saw that an old spell was enthralling\nDavies as his eye travelled away to the blank horizon. He scanned it\nall with a critical eagerness, too, as one who looks for a new\nmeaning in an old friend's face. Something of his zest was\ncommunicated to me, and stilled the shuddering thrill that had seized\nme. The protecting land was still a comforting neighbour; but our\nseverance with it came quickly. The tide whirled us down, and our\nstraining canvas aiding it, we were soon off Cuxhaven, which crouched\nso low behind its mighty dyke, that of some of its houses only the\nchimneys were visible. Then, a mile or so on, the shore sharpened to\na point like a claw, where the innocent dyke became a long, low fort,\nwith some great guns peeping over; then of a sudden it ceased,\nretreating into the far south in a dim perspective of groins and\ndunes.\n\nWe spun out into the open and leant heavily over to the now\nunobstructed wind. The yacht rose and sank to a little swell, but my\nfirst impression was one of wonder at the calmness of the sea, for\nthe wind blew fresh and free from horizon to horizon.\n\n'Why, it's all sand _there_ now, and we're under the lee of it,' said\nDavies, with an enthusiastic sweep of his hand over the sea on our\nleft or port hand. 'That's our hunting ground.'\n\n'What are we going to do?' I inquired.\n\n'Pick up Sticker's Gat,' was the reply. 'It ought to be near Buoy K.'\n\nA red buoy with a huge K on it soon came into view. Davies peered\nover to port.\n\n'Just pull up the centreboard, will you?' he remarked abstractedly,\nadding, 'and hand me up the glasses as you are down there.'\n\n'Never mind the glasses. I've got it now; come to the main-sheet,'\nwas the next remark.\n\nHe put down the helm and headed the yacht straight for the troubled\nand discoloured expanse which covered the submerged sands. A\n'sleeping whale', with a light surf splashing on it, was right in our\npath.\n\n'Stand by the lead, will you?' said Davies, politely. 'I'll manage\nthe sheets, it's a dead beat in. Ready about!'\n\nThe wind was in our teeth now, and for a crowded half-hour we wormed\nourselves forward by ever-shortening tacks into the sinuous recesses\nof a channel which threaded the shallows westward. I knelt in a\ntangle of line, and, under the hazy impression that something very\ncritical was going on, plied the lead furiously, bumping and\nsplashing myself, and shouting out the depths, which lessened\nsteadily, with a great sense of the importance of my function. Davies\nnever seemed to listen, but tacked on imperturbably, juggling with\nthe tiller, the sheets, and the chart, in a way that made one giddy\nto look at. For all our zeal we seemed to be making very slow\nprogress.\n\n'It's no use, tide's too strong; we must chance it,' he said at last.\n\n'Chance what?' I wondered to myself. Our tacks suddenly began to grow\nlonger, and the depths, which I registered, shallower. All went well\nfor some time though, and we made better progress. Then came a longer\nreach than usual.\n\n'Two and a half--two--one and a half--one--only five feet,' I gasped,\nreproachfully. The water was growing thick and frothy.\n\n'It doesn't matter if we do,' said Davies, thinking aloud. 'There's\nan eddy here, and it's a pity to waste it--ready about! Back the\njib!'\n\nBut it was too late. The yacht answered but faintly to the helm,\nstopped, and heeled heavily over, wallowing and grinding. Davies had\nthe mainsail down in a twinkling; it half smothered me as I crouched\non the lee-side among my tangled skeins of line, scared and helpless.\nI crawled out from the folds, and saw him standing by the mast in a\nreverie.\n\n'It's not much use,' he said, 'on a falling tide, but we'll try\nkedging-off. Pay that warp out while I run out the kedge.'\n\nLike lightning he had cast off the dinghy's painter, tumbled the\nkedge-anchor and himself into the dinghy, pulled out fifty yards into\nthe deeper water, and heaved out the anchor.\n\n'Now haul,' he shouted.\n\nI hauled, beginning to see what kedging-off meant.\n\n'Steady on! Don't sweat yourself,' said Davies, jumping aboard again.\n\n'It's coming,' I spluttered, triumphantly.\n\n'The warp is, the yacht isn't; you're dragging the anchor home. Never\nmind, she'll lie well here. Let's have lunch.'\n\nThe yacht was motionless, and the water round her visibly lower.\nPetulant waves slapped against her sides, but, scattered as my senses\nwere, I realized that there was no vestige of danger. Round us the\nwhole face of the waters was changing from moment to moment,\nwhitening in some places, yellowing in others, where breadths of sand\nbegan to be exposed. Close on our right the channel we had left began\nto look like a turbid little river; and I understood why our progress\nhad been so slow when I saw its current racing back to meet the Elbe.\nDavies was already below, laying out a more than usually elaborate\nlunch, in high content of mind.\n\n'Lies quiet, doesn't she?' he remarked. 'If you _do_ want a sit-down\nlunch, there's nothing like running aground for it. And, anyhow,\nwe're as handy for work here as anywhere else. You'll see.'\n\nLike most landsmen I had a wholesome prejudice against running\naground, so that my mentor's turn for breezy paradox was at first\nrather exasperating. After lunch the large-scale chart of the\nestuaries was brought down, and we pored over it together, mapping\nout work for the next few days. There is no need to tire the general\nreader with its intricacies, nor is there space to reproduce it for\nthe benefit of the instructed reader. For both classes the general\nmap should be sufficient, taken with the large-scale fragment _[See\nChart A]_ which gives a fair example of the region in detail. It will\nbe seen that the three broad fairways of the Jade, Weser and Elbe\nsplit up the sands into two main groups. The westernmost of these is\nsymmetrical in outline, an acute-angled triangle, very like a sharp\nsteel-shod pike, if you imagine the peninsula from which it springs\nto be the wooden haft. The other is a huge congeries of banks, its\nbase resting on the Hanover coast, two of its sides tolerably clean\nand even, and the third, that facing the north-west, ribboned and\nlacerated by the fury of the sea, which has eaten out deep cavities\nand struck hungry tentacles far into the interior. The whole\nresembles an inverted E, or, better still, a rude fork, on whose\nthree deadly prongs, the Scharhorn Reef, the Knecht Sand, and the\nTegeler Flat, as on the no less deadly point of the pike, many a good\nship splinters herself in northerly gales. Following this simile, the\nHohenh\u00c3\u00b6rn bank, where Davies was wrecked, is one of those that lie\nbetween the upper and middle prongs.\n\nOur business was to explore the Pike and the Fork and the channels\nwhich ramify through them. I use the general word 'channel', but in\nfact they differ widely in character, and are called in German by\nvarious names: Balje, Gat, Loch, Diep, Rinne. For my purpose I need\nonly divide them into two sorts--those which have water in them at\nall states of the tide, and those which have not, which dry off, that\nis, either wholly or partly at low-tide.\n\nDavies explained that the latter would take most learning, and were\nto be our chief concern, because they were the 'through-routes'--the\nconnecting links between the estuaries. You can always detect them on\nthe chart by rows of little Y-shaped strokes denoting 'booms', that\nis to say, poles or saplings fixed in the sand to mark the passage.\nThe strokes, of course, are only conventional signs, and do not\ncorrespond in the least to individual 'booms', which are far too\nnumerous and complex to be indicated accurately on a chart, even of\nthe largest scale. The same applies to the course of the channels\nthemselves, whose minor meanderings cannot be reproduced.\n\nIt was on the edge of one of these tidal swatchways that the yacht\nwas now lying. It is called Sticker's Gat, and you cannot miss it\n_[See Chart A]_ if you carry your eye westward along our course from\nCuxhaven. It was, so Davies told me, the last and most intricate\nstage of the 'short cut' which the 'Medusa' had taken on that memorable\nday--a stage he himself had never reached. Discussion ended, we went\non deck, Davies arming himself with a notebook, binoculars, and the\nprismatic compass, whose use--to map the angles of the channels--was\nat last apparent. This is what I saw when we emerged.\n\n\n\n\nXII. My Initiation\n\n\nTHE yacht lay with a very slight heel (thanks to a pair of small\nbilge-keels on her bottom) in a sort of trough she had dug for\nherself, so that she was still ringed with a few inches of water, as\nit were with a moat.\n\nFor miles in every direction lay a desert of sand. To the north it\ntouched the horizon, and was only broken by the blue dot of Neuerk\nIsland and its lighthouse. To the east it seemed also to stretch to\ninfinity, but the smoke of a steamer showed where it was pierced by\nthe stream of the Elbe. To the south it ran up to the pencil-line of\nthe Hanover shore. Only to the west was its outline broken by any\nvestiges of the sea it had risen from. There it was astir with\ncrawling white filaments, knotted confusedly at one spot in the\nnorth-west, whence came a sibilant murmur like the hissing of many\nsnakes. Desert as I call it, it was not entirely featureless. Its\ncolour varied from light fawn, where the highest levels had dried in\nthe wind, to brown or deep violet, where it was still wet, and\nslate-grey where patches of mud soiled its clean bosom. Here and\nthere were pools of water, smitten into ripples by the impotent wind;\nhere and there it was speckled by shells and seaweed. And close to\nus, beginning to bend away towards that hissing knot in the\nnorth-west, wound our poor little channel, mercilessly exposed as a\nstagnant, muddy ditch with scarcely a foot of water, not deep enough\nto hide our small kedge-anchor, which perked up one fluke in impudent\nmockery. The dull, hard sky, the wind moaning in the rigging as\nthough crying in despair for a prey that had escaped it, made the\nscene inexpressibly forlorn.\n\nDavies scanned it with gusto for a moment, climbed to a point of\nvantage on the boom, and swept his glasses to and fro along the\ncourse of the channel.\n\n'Fairly well boomed,' he said, meditatively, 'but one or two are very\nmuch out. By Jove! that's a tricky bend there.' He took a bearing\nwith the compass, made a note or two, and sprang with a vigorous leap\ndown on to the sand.\n\nThis, I may say, was the only way of 'going ashore' that he really\nliked. We raced off as fast as our clumsy sea-boots would let us, and\nfollowed up the course of our channel to the west, reconnoitring the\nroad we should have to follow when the tide rose.\n\n'The only way to learn a place like this,' he shouted, 'is to see it\nat low water. The banks are dry then, and the channels are plain.\nLook at that boom'--he stopped and pointed contemptuously--'it's all\nout of place. I suppose the channel's shifted there. It's just at an\nimportant bend too. If you took it as a guide when the water was up\nyou'd run aground.'\n\n'Which would be very useful,' I observed.\n\n'Oh, hang it!' he laughed, 'we're exploring. I want to be able to run\nthrough this channel without a mistake. We will, next time.' He\nstopped, and plied compass and notebook. Then we raced on till the\nnext halt was called.\n\n'Look,' he said, the channel's getting deeper, it was nearly dry a\nmoment ago; see the current in it now? That's the flood tide coming\nup--from the _west,_ mind you; that is, from the Weser side. That\nshows we're past the watershed.'\n\n'Watershed?' I repeated, blankly.\n\n'Yes, that's what I call it. You see, a big sand such as this is like\na range of hills dividing two plains, it's never dead flat though it\nlooks it; there's always one point, one ridge, rather, where it's\nhighest. Now a channel cutting right through the sand is, of course,\nalways at its shallowest when it's crossing this ridge; at low water\nit's generally dry there, and it gradually deepens as it gets nearer\nto the sea on either side. Now at high tide, when the whole sand is\ncovered, the water can travel where it likes; but directly the ebb\nsets in the water falls away on either side the ridge and the channel\nbecomes two rivers flowing in opposite directions _from_ the centre,\nor watershed, as I call it. So, also, when the ebb has run out and\nthe flood begins, the channel is fed by two currents flowing to the\ncentre and meeting in the middle. Here the Elbe and the Weser are our\ntwo feeders. Now this current here is going eastwards; we know by the\ntime of day that the tide's rising, _therefore_ the watershed is\nbetween us and the yacht.'\n\n'Why is it so important to know that?'\n\n'Because these currents are strong, and you want to know when you'll\nlose a fair one and strike a foul one. Besides, the ridge is the\ncritical point when you're crossing on a falling tide, and you want\nto know when you're past it.'\n\nWe pushed on till our path was barred by a big lagoon. It looked far\nmore imposing than the channel; but Davies, after a rapid scrutiny,\ntreated it to a grunt of contempt.\n\n'It's a _cul de sac_,' he said. 'See that hump of sand it's making\nfor, beyond?'\n\n'It's boomed,' I remonstrated, pointing to a decrepit stem drooping\nover the bank, and shaking a palsied finger at the imposture.\n\n'Yes, that's just where one goes wrong, it's an old cut that's silted\nup. That boom's a fraud; there's no time to go farther, the flood's\nmaking fast. I'll just take bearings of what we can see.'\n\nThe false lagoon was the first of several that began to be visible in\nthe west, swelling and joining hands over the ribs of sand that\ndivided them. All the time the distant hissing grew nearer and\nlouder, and a deep, thunderous note began to sound beneath it. We\nturned our backs to the wind and hastened back towards the\n_Dulcibella_, the stream in our channel hurrying and rising alongside\nof us.\n\n'There's just time to do the other side,' said Davies, when we\nreached her, and I was congratulating myself on having regained our\nbase without finding our communications cut. And away we scurried in\nthe direction we had come that morning, splashing through pools and\njumping the infant runnels that were stealing out through rifts from\nthe mother-channel as the tide rose. Our observations completed, back\nwe travelled, making a wide circuit over higher ground to avoid the\nencroaching flood, and wading shin-deep in the final approach to the\nyacht.\n\nAs I scrambled thankfully aboard, I seemed to hear a far-off voice\nsaying, in languid depreciation of yachting, that it did not give one\nenough exercise. It was mine, centuries ago, in another life. From\neast and west two sheets of water had overspread the desert, each\npushing out tongues of surf that met and fused.\n\nI waited on deck and watched the death-throes of the suffocating\nsands under the relentless onset of the sea. The last strongholds\nwere battered, stormed, and overwhelmed; the tumult of sounds sank\nand steadied, and the sea swept victoriously over the whole expanse.\nThe _Dulcibella_, hitherto contemptuously inert, began to wake and\ntremble under the buffetings she received. Then, with an effort, she\njerked herself on to an even keel and bumped and strained fretfully,\nimpatient to vanquish this insolent invader and make him a slave for\nher own ends. Soon her warp tightened and her nose swung slowly\nround; only her stern bumped now, and that with decreasing force.\nSuddenly she was free and drifting broadside to the wind till the\nanchor checked her and she brought up to leeward of it, rocking\neasily and triumphantly. Good-humoured little person! At heart she\nwas friends alike with sand and sea. It was only when the old love\nand the new love were in mortal combat for her favours, and she was\nmauled in the _fracas_, that her temper rose in revolt.\n\nWe swallowed a hasty cup of tea, ran up the sails, and started off\nwest again. Once across the 'watershed' we met a strong current, but\nthe trend of the passage was now more to the north-west, so that we\ncould hold our course without tacking, and consequently could stem\nthe tide. 'Give her just a foot of the centre-plate,' said Davies.\n'We know the way here, and she'll make less leeway; but we shall\ngenerally have to do without it always on a falling tide. If you run\naground with the plate down you deserve to be drowned.' I now saw how\nvaluable our walk had been. The booms were on our right; but they\nwere broken reeds, giving no hint as to the breadth of the channel. A\nfew had lost their tops, and were being engulfed altogether by the\nrising water. When we came to the point where they ceased, and the\nfalse lagoon had lain, I should have felt utterly lost. We had\ncrossed the high and relatively level sands which form the base of\nthe Fork, and were entering the labyrinth of detached banks which\nobstruct the funnel-shaped cavity between the upper and middle\nprongs. This I knew from the chart. My unaided eye saw nothing but\nthe open sea, growing dark green as the depths increased; a dour,\nthreatening sea, showing its white fangs. The waves grew longer and\nsteeper, for the channels, though still tortuous, now begin to be\nbroad and deep.\n\nDavies had his bearings, and struck on his course confidently. 'Now\nfor the lead,' he said; 'the compass'll be little use soon. We must\nfeel the edge of the sands till we pick up more booms.'\n\n'Where are we going to anchor for the night?' I asked.\n\n'Under the Hohenh\u00c3\u00b6rn,' said Davies, 'for auld lang syne!'\n\nPartly by sight and mostly by touch we crept round the outermost\nalley of the hidden maze till a new clump of booms appeared,\nmeaningless to me, but analysed by him into two groups. One we\nfollowed for some distance, and then struck finally away and began\nanother beat to windward.\n\nDusk was falling. The Hanover coast-line, never very distinct, had\nutterly vanished; an ominous heave of swell was under-running the\nshort sea. I ceased to attend to Davies imparting instruction on his\nbeloved hobby, and sought to stifle in hard manual labour the dread\nthat had been latent in me all day at the prospect of our first\nanchorage at sea.\n\n'Sound, like blazes now!' he said at last. I came to a fathom and a\nhalf. 'That's the bank,' he said; 'we'll give it a bit of a berth and\nthen let go.'\n\n'Let go now!' was the order after a minute, and the chain ran out\nwith a long-drawn moan. The _Dulcibella_ snubbed up to it and jauntily\nfaced the North Sea and the growing night.\n\n'There we are!' said Davies, as we finished stowing the mainsail,\n'safe and snug in four fathoms in a magnificent sand-harbour, with no\none to bother us and the whole of it to ourselves. No dues, no\nstinks, no traffic, no worries of any sort. It's better than a Baltic\ncove even, less beastly civilization about. We're seven miles from\nthe nearest coast, and five even from Neuerk--look, they're lighting\nup.' There was a tiny spark in the east.\n\n'I suppose it's all right,' I said, 'but I'd rather see a solid\nbreakwater somewhere; it's a dirty-looking night, and I don't like\nthis swell.'\n\n'The swell's nothing,' said Davies; 'it's only a stray drain from\noutside. As for breakwaters, you've got them all round you, only\nthey're hidden. Ahead and to starboard is the West Hohenh\u00c3\u00b6rn, curling\nround to the sou'-west for all the world like a stone pier. You can\nhear the surf battering on its outside over to the north. That's\nwhere I was nearly wrecked that day, and the little channel I\nstumbled into must be quite near us somewhere. Half a mile away--to\nport there--is the East Hohenh\u00c3\u00b6rn, where I brought up, after dashing\nacross this lake we're in. Another mile astern is the main body of\nthe sands, the top prong of your fork. So you see we're shut\nin--practically. Surely you remember the chart? Why, it's----'\n\n'Oh, confound the chart!' I broke out, finding this flow of plausible\ncomfort too dismally suggestive for my nerves. '_Look_ at it, man!\nSupposing anything happens--supposing it blows a gale! But it's no\ngood shivering here and staring at the view. I'm going below.'\n\nThere was a _mauvais quart d'heure_ below, during which, I am ashamed\nto say, I forgot the quest.\n\n'Which soup do you feel inclined for?' said Davies, timidly, after a\nblack silence of some minutes.\n\nThat simple remark, more eloquent of security than a thousand\ntechnical arguments, saved the situation.\n\n'I say, Davies,' I said, 'I'm a white-livered cur at the best, and\nyou mustn't spare me. But you're not like any yachtsman I ever met\nbefore, or any sailor of any sort. You're so casual and quiet in the\nextraordinary things you do. I believe I should like you better if\nyou let fly a volley of deep-sea oaths sometimes, or threatened to\nput me in irons.'\n\nDavies opened wide eyes, and said it was all his fault for forgetting\nthat I was not as used to such anchorages as he was. 'And, by the\nway,' he added, 'as to its blowing a gale, I shouldn't wonder if it\ndid; the glass is falling hard; but it can't hurt us. You see, even\nat high water the drift of the sea----'\n\n'Oh, for Heaven's sake, don't begin again. You'll prove soon that\nwe're safer here than in an hotel. Let's have dinner, and a\nthundering good one!'\n\nDinner ran a smooth course, but just as coffee was being brewed the\nhull, from pitching regularly, began to roll.\n\n'I knew she would,' said Davies. 'I was going to warn you, only--the\nebb has set in _against_ the wind. It's quite safe----'\n\n'I thought you said it would get calmer when the tide fell?'\n\n'So it will, but it may _seem_ rougher. Tides are queer things,' he\nadded, as though in defence of some not very respectable\nacquaintances.\n\nHe busied himself with his logbook, swaying easily to the motion of\nthe boat; and I for my part tried to write up my diary, but I could\nnot fix my attention. Every loose article in the boat became audibly\nrestless. Cans clinked, cupboards rattled, lockers uttered hollow\ngroans. Small things sidled out of dark hiding-places, and danced\ngrotesque drunken figures on the floor, like goblins in a haunted\nglade. The mast whined dolorously at every heel, and the centreboard\nhiccoughed and choked. Overhead another horde of demons seemed to\nhave been let loose. The deck and mast were conductors which\nmagnified every sound and made the tap-tap of every rope's end\nresemble the blows of a hammer, and the slapping of the halyards\nagainst the mast the rattle of a Maxim gun. The whole tumult beat\ntime to a rhythmical chorus which became maddening.\n\n'We might turn in now,' said Davies; 'it's half-past ten.'\n\n'What, sleep through this?' I exclaimed. 'I can't stand this, I must\n_do_ something. Can't we go for another walk?'\n\nI spoke in bitter, half-delirious jest.\n\n'Of course we can,' said Davies, 'if you don't mind a bit of a tumble\nin the dinghy.'\n\nI reconsidered my rash suggestion, but it was too late now to turn\nback, and some desperate expedient was necessary. I found myself on\ndeck, gripping a backstay and looking giddily down and then up at the\ndinghy, as it bobbed like a cork in the trough of the sea alongside,\nwhile Davies settled the sculls and rowlocks.\n\n'Jump!' he shouted, and before I could gather my wits and clutch the\nsides we were adrift in the night, reeling from hollow to hollow of\nthe steep curling waves. Davies nursed our walnut-shell tenderly over\ntheir crests, edging her slantwise across their course. He used very\nlittle exertion, relying on the tide to carry us to our goal.\nSuddenly the motion ceased. A dark slope loomed up out of the night,\nand the dinghy rested softly in a shallow eddy.\n\n'The West Hohenh\u00c3\u00b6rn,' said Davies. We jumped out and sank into soft\nmud, hauled up the dinghy a foot or two, then mounted the bank and\nwere on hard, wet sand. The wind leapt on us, and choked our voices.\n\n'Let's find my channel,' bawled Davies. 'This way. Keep Neuerk light\nright astern of you.'\n\nWe set off with a long, stooping stride in the teeth of the wind, and\nstraight towards the roar of the breakers on the farther side of the\nsand. A line of Matthew Arnold's, 'The naked shingles of the world,'\nwas running in my head. 'Seven miles from land,' I thought,\n'scuttling like sea-birds on a transient islet of sand, encircled by\nrushing tides and hammered by ocean, at midnight in a rising\ngale--cut off even from our one dubious refuge.' It was the time, if\never, to conquer weakness. A mad gaiety surged through me as I drank\nthe wind and pressed forward. It seemed but a minute or two and\nDavies clutched me.\n\n'Look out!' he shouted. 'It's my channel.'\n\nThe ground sloped down, and a rushing river glimmered before us. We\nstruck off at a tangent and followed its course to the north,\nstumbling in muddy rifts, slipping on seaweed, beginning to be\nblinded by a fine salt spray, and deafened by the thunder of the\nocean surf. The river broadened, whitened, roughened, gathered itself\nfor the shock, was shattered, and dissolved in milky gloom. We\nwheeled away to the right, and splashed into yeasty froth. I turned\nmy back to the wind, scooped the brine out of my eyes, faced back and\nsaw that our path was barred by a welter of surf. Davies's voice was\nin my ear and his arm was pointing seaward.\n\n'This--is--about where--I--bumped first--worse then--nor'-west\nwind--this--is--nothing. Let's--go--right--round.'\n\nWe galloped away with the wind behind us, skirting the line of surf.\nI lost all account of time and direction. Another sea barred our\nroad, became another river as we slanted along its shore. Again we\nwere in the teeth of that intoxicating wind. Then a point of light\nwas swaying and flickering away to the left, and now we were checking\nand circling. I stumbled against something sharp--the dinghy's\ngunwale. So we had completed the circuit of our fugitive domain, that\ndream-island--nightmare island as I always remember it.\n\n'You must scull, too,' said Davies. 'It's blowing hard now. Keep her\nnose _up_ a little--all you know!'\n\nWe lurched along, my scull sometimes buried to the thwart, sometimes\nstriking at the bubbles of a wave top. Davies, in the bows, said\n'Pull!' or 'Steady!' at intervals. I heard the scud smacking against\nhis oilskin back. Then a wan, yellow light glanced over the waves.\n'Easy! Let her come!' and the bowsprit of the _Dulcibella_, swollen to\nspectral proportions, was stabbing the darkness above me. 'Back a\nbit! Two good strokes. Ship your scull! Now jump!' I clawed at the\ntossing hull and landed in a heap. Davies followed with the painter,\nand the dinghy swept astern.\n\n'She's riding beautifully now,' said he, when he had secured the\npainter. 'There'll be no rolling on the flood, and it's nearly low\nwater.'\n\nI don't think I should have cared, however much she had rolled. I was\nfinally cured of funk.\n\nIt was well that I was, for to be pitched out of your bunk on to wet\noil-cloth is a disheartening beginning to a day. This happened about\neight o'clock. The yacht was pitching violently, and I crawled on all\nfours into the cabin, where Davies was setting out breakfast on the\nfloor.\n\n'I let you sleep on,' he said; 'we can't do anything till the water\nfalls. We should never get the anchor up in this sea. Come and have a\nlook round. It's clearing now,' he went on, when we were crouching\nlow on deck, gripping cleats for safety. 'Wind's veered to nor'-west.\nIt's been blowing a full gale, and the sea is at its worst now--near\nhigh water. You'll never see worse than this.'\n\nI was prepared for what I saw--the stormy sea for leagues around, and\na chaos of breakers where our dream-island had stood--and took it\nquietly, even with a sort of elation. The _Dulcibella_ faced the storm\nas doggedly as ever, plunging her bowsprit into the sea and flinging\ngreen water over her bows. A wave of confidence and affection for her\nwelled through me. I had been used to resent the weight and bulk of\nher unwieldy anchor and cable, but I saw their use now; varnish,\npaint, spotless decks, and snowy sails were foppish absurdities of a\nhateful past.\n\n'What can we do to-day?' I asked.\n\n'We must keep well inside the banks and be precious careful wherever\nthere's a swell. It's rampant in here, you see, in spite of the\nbarrier of sand. But there's plenty we can do farther back.'\n\nWe breakfasted in horrible discomfort; then smoked and talked till\nthe roar of the breakers dwindled. At the first sign of bare sand we\ngot under way, under mizzen and headsails only, and I learned how to\nsail a reluctant anchor out of the ground. Pivoting round, we scudded\neast before the wind, over the ground we had traversed the evening\nbefore, while an archipelago of new banks slowly shouldered up above\nthe fast weakening waves. We trod delicately among and around them,\nsounding and observing; heaving to where space permitted, and\nsometimes using the dinghy. I began to see where the risks lay in\nthis sort of navigation. Wherever the ocean swell penetrated, or the\nwind blew straight down a long deep channel, we had to be very\ncautious and leave good margins. 'That's the sort of place you\nmustn't ground on,' Davies used to say.\n\nIn the end we traversed the Steil Sand again, but by a different\nswatchway, and anchored, after an arduous day, in a notch on its\neastern limit, just clear of the swell that rolled in from the\nturbulent estuary of the Elbe. The night was fair, and when the tide\nreceded we lay perfectly still, the fresh wind only sending a lip-lip\nof ripples against our sides.\n\n\n\n\nXIII. The Meaning of our Work\n\n\nNOTHING happened during the next ten days to disturb us at our work.\nDuring every hour of daylight and many of darkness, sailing or\nanchored, aground or afloat, in rain and shine, wind and calm, we\nstudied the bed of the estuaries, and practised ourselves in\nthreading the network of channels; holding no communication with the\nland and rarely approaching it. It was a life of toil, exposure, and\nperil; a struggle against odds, too; for wild autumnal weather was\nthe rule, with the wind backing and veering between the south-west\nand north-west, and only for two placid days blowing gently from the\neast, the safe quarter for this region. Its force and direction\ndetermined each fresh choice of ground. If it was high and northerly\nwe explored the inner fastnesses; in moderate intervals the exterior\nfringe, darting when surprised into whatever lair was most\nconvenient.\n\nSometimes we were tramping vast solitudes of sand, sometimes scudding\nacross ephemeral tracts of shallow sea. Again, we were creeping\ngingerly round the deeper arteries that surround the Great Knecht,\nexamining their convolutions as it were the veins of a living tissue,\nand the circulation of the tide throbbing through them like blood.\nAgain, we would be staggering through the tide-rips and overfalls\nthat infest the open fairway of the Weser on our passage between the\nFork and the Pike. On one of our fine days I saw the scene of\nDavies's original adventure by daylight with the banks dry and the\nchannels manifest. The reader has seen it on the chart, and can, up\nto a point, form his opinion; I can only add that I realized by\nocular proof that no more fatal trap could have been devised for an\ninnocent stranger; for approaching it from the north-west under the\neasiest conditions it was hard enough to verify our true course. In a\nperiod so full of new excitements it is not easy for me to say when\nwe were hardest put to it, especially as it was a rule with Davies\nnever to admit that we were in any danger at all. But I think that\nour ugliest experience was on the 10th, when, owing to some minute\nmiscalculation, we stranded in a dangerous spot. Mere stranding, of\ncourse, was all in the day's work; the constantly recurring question\nbeing when and where to court or risk it. This time we were so\nsituated that when the rising tide came again we were on a lee shore,\nbroadside on to a gale of wind which was sending a nasty sea--with a\nthree-mile drift to give it force--down Robin's Balje, which is one\nof the deeper arteries I spoke of above, and now lay dead to windward\nof us. The climax came about ten o'clock at night. 'We can do nothing\ntill she floats,' said Davies; and I can see him now quietly smoking\nand splicing a chafed warp while he explained that her double skin of\nteak fitted her to stand anything in reason. She certainly had a\nterrific test that night, for the bottom was hard, unyielding sand,\non which she rose and fell with convulsive vehemence. The last\nhalf-hour was for me one of almost intolerable tension. I spent it on\ndeck unable to bear the suspense below. Sheets of driven sea flew\nbodily over the hull, and a score of times I thought she must succumb\nas she shivered to the blows of her keel on the sand. But those stout\nskins knit by honest labour stood the trial. One final thud and she\nwrenched herself bodily free, found her anchor, and rode clear.\n\nOn the whole I think we made few mistakes. Davies had a supreme\naptitude for the work. Every hour, sometimes every minute, brought\nits problem, and his resource never failed. The stiffer it was the\ncooler he became. He had, too, that intuition which is independent of\nacquired skill, and is at the root of all genius; which, to take\ncases analogous to his own, is the last quality of the perfect guide\nor scout. I believe he could _smell_ sand where he could not see or\ntouch it.\n\nAs for me, the sea has never been my element, and never will be;\nnevertheless, I hardened to the life, grew salt, tough, and tolerably\nalert. As a soldier learns more in a week of war than in years of\nparades and pipeclay, so, cut off from all distractions, moving from\nbivouac to precarious bivouac, and depending, to some extent, for my\nlife on my muscles and wits, I rapidly learnt my work and gained a\ncertain dexterity. I knew my ropes in the dark, could beat\neconomically to windward through squalls, take bearings, and estimate\nthe interaction of wind and tide.\n\nWe were generally in solitude, but occasionally we met galliots like\nthe 'Johannes' tacking through the sands, and once or twice we found a\nfleet of such boats anchored in a gut, waiting for water. Their\ndraught, loaded, was from six to seven feet, our own only four,\nwithout our centre-plate, but we took their mean draught as the\nstandard of all our observations. That is, we set ourselves to\nascertain when and how a vessel drawing six and a half feet could\nnavigate the sands.\n\nA word more as to our motive. It was Davies's conviction, as I have\nsaid, that the whole region would in war be an ideal hunting-ground\nfor small free-lance marauders, and I began to know he was right; for\nlook at the three sea-roads through the sands to Hamburg, Bremen,\nWilhelmshaven, and the heart of commercial Germany. They are like\nhighways piercing a mountainous district by defiles, where a handful\nof desperate men can arrest an army.\n\nFollow the parallel of a war on land. People your mountains with a\ndaring and resourceful race, who possess an intimate knowledge of\nevery track and bridle-path, who operate in small bands, travel\nlight, and move rapidly. See what an immense advantage such guerillas\npossess over an enemy which clings to beaten tracks, moves in large\nbodies, slowly, and does not 'know the country'. See how they can not\nonly inflict disasters on a foe who vastly overmatches them in\nstrength, but can prolong a semi-passive resistance long after all\ndecisive battles have been fought. See, too, how the strong invader\ncan only conquer his elusive antagonists by learning their methods,\nstudying the country, and matching them in mobility and cunning. The\nparallel must not be pressed too far; but that this sort of warfare\nwill have its counterpart on the sea is a truth which cannot be\nquestioned.\n\nDavies in his enthusiasm set no limits to its importance. The small\nboat in shallow waters played a mighty _r\u00c3\u00b4le_ in his vision of a\nnaval war, a part that would grow in importance as the war developed\nand reach its height in the final stages.\n\n'The heavy battle fleets are all very well,' he used to say, 'but if\nthe sides are well matched there might be nothing left of them after\na few months of war. They might destroy one another mutually, leaving\nas nominal conqueror an admiral with scarcely a battleship to bless\nhimself with. It's then that the true struggle will set in; and it's\nthen that anything that will float will be pressed into the service,\nand anybody who can steer a boat, knows his waters, and doesn't care\nthe toss of a coin for his life, will have magnificent opportunities.\nIt cuts both ways. What small boats can do in these waters is plain\nenough; but take our own case. Say we're beaten on the high seas by a\ncoalition. There's then a risk of starvation or invasion. It's all\nrot what they talk about instant surrender. We can live on half\nrations, recuperate, and build; but we must have time. Meanwhile our\ncoast and ports are in danger, for the millions we sink in forts and\nmines won't carry us far. They're fixed--pure passive defence. What\nyou want is _boats_--mosquitoes with stings--swarms of\nthem--patrol-boats, scout-boats, torpedo-boats; intelligent\nirregulars manned by local men, with a pretty free hand to play their\nown game. And what a splendid game to play! There are places very\nlike this over there--nothing half so good, but similar--the Mersey\nestuary, the Dee, the Severn, the Wash, and, best of all, the Thames,\nwith all the Kent, Essex, and Suffolk banks round it. But as for\ndefending our coasts in the way I mean--we've nothing ready--nothing\nwhatsoever! We don't even build or use small torpedo-boats. These\nfast \"destroyers\" are no good for _this_ work--too long and\nunmanageable, and most of them too deep. What you want is something\nstrong and simple, of light draught, and with only a spar-torpedo, if\nit came to that. Tugs, launches, small yachts--anything would do at a\npinch, for success would depend on intelligence, not on brute force\nor complicated mechanism. They'd get wiped out often, but what\nmatter? There'd be no lack of the right sort of men for them if the\nthing was _organized._ But where are the men?\n\n'Or, suppose we have the best of it on the high seas, and have to\nattack or blockade a coast like this, which is sand from end to end.\nYou can't improvise people who are at home in such waters. The navy\nchaps don't learn it, though, by Jove! they're the most magnificent\nservice in the world--in pluck, and nerve, and everything else.\nThey'll _try_ anything, and often do the impossible. But their boats\nare deep, and they get little practice in this sort of thing.'\n\nDavies never pushed home his argument here; but I know that it was\nthe passionate wish of his heart, somehow and somewhere, to get a\nchance of turning his knowledge of this coast to practical account in\nthe war that he felt was bound to come, to play that 'splendid game'\nin this, the most fascinating field for it.\n\nI can do no more than sketch his views. Hearing them as I did, with\nthe very splash of the surf and the bubble of the tides in my ears,\nthey made a profound impression on me, and gave me the very zeal for\nour work he, by temperament, possessed.\n\nBut as the days passed and nothing occurred to disturb us, I felt\nmore and more strongly that, as regards our quest, we were on the\nwrong tack. We found nothing suspicious, nothing that suggested a\nreally adequate motive for Dollmann's treachery. I became impatient,\nand was for pushing on more quickly westward. Davies still clung to\nhis theory, but the same feeling influenced him.\n\n'It's something to do with these channels in the sand,' he persisted,\n'but I'm afraid, as you say, we haven't got at the heart of the\nmystery. Nobody seems to care a rap what we do. We haven't done the\nestuaries as well as I should like, but we'd better push on to the\nislands. It's exactly the same sort of work, and just as important, I\nbelieve. We're bound to get a clue soon.'\n\nThere was also the question of time, for me at least. I was due to be\nback in London, unless I obtained an extension, on the 28th, and our\npresent rate of progress was slow. But I cannot conscientiously say\nthat I made a serious point of this. If there was any value in our\nenterprise at all, official duty pales beside it. The machinery of\nState would not suffer from my absence; excuses would have to be\nmade, and the results braved.\n\nAll the time our sturdy little craft grew shabbier and more\nweather-worn, the varnish thinner, the decks greyer, the sails\ndingier, and the cabin roof more murky where stove-fumes stained it.\nBut the only beauty she ever possessed, that of perfect fitness for\nher functions, remained. With nothing to compare her to she became a\nhome to me. My joints adapted themselves to her crabbed limits, my\ntastes and habits to her plain domestic economy.\n\nBut oil and water were running low, and the time had come for us to\nbe forced to land and renew our stock.\n\n\n\n\nXIV. The First Night in the Islands\n\n\nA LOW line of sandhills, pink and fawn in the setting sun, at one end\nof them a little white village huddled round the base of a massive\nfour-square lighthouse--such was Wangeroog, the easternmost of the\nFrisian Islands, as I saw it on the evening of October 15. We had\ndecided to make it our first landing-place; and since it possesses no\nharbour, and is hedged by a mile of sand at low water, we had run in\non the rising tide till the yacht grounded, in order to save\nourselves as much labour as possible in the carriage to and fro of\nthe heavy water-breakers and oil-cans which we had to replenish. In\nfaint outline three miles to the south of us was the flat plain of\nFriesland, broken only by some trees, a windmill or two, and a church\nspire. Between, the shallow expanse of sea was already beginning to\nshrink away into lagoons, chief among which was the narrow passage by\nwhich we had approached from the east. This continued its course\nwest, directly parallel to the island, and in it, at a distance of\nhalf a mile from us, three galliots lay at anchor.\n\nBefore supper was over the yacht was high and dry, and when we had\neaten, Davies loaded himself with cans and breakers. I was for taking\nmy share, but he induced me to stay aboard; for I was dead tired\nafter an unusually long and trying day, which had begun at 2 a.m.,\nwhen, using a precious instalment of east wind, we had started on a\ncomplete passage of the sands from the Elbe to the Jade. It was a\nbarely possible feat for a boat of our low speed to perform in only\ntwo tides; and though we just succeeded, it was only by dint of\ntireless vigilance and severe physical strain.\n\n'Lay out the anchor when you've had a smoke,' said Davies, 'and keep\nan eye on the riding-light; it's my only guide back.'\n\nHe lowered himself, and I heard the scrunch of his sea-boots as he\ndisappeared in the darkness. It was a fine starry night, with a touch\nof frost in the air. I lit a cigar, and stretched myself on a sofa\nclose to the glow of the stove. The cigar soon languished and\ndropped, and I dozed uneasily, for the riding-light was on my mind. I\ngot up once and squinted at it through the half-raised skylight, saw\nit burning steadily, and lay down again. The cabin lamp wanted oil\nand was dying down to a red-hot wick, but I was too drowsy to attend\nto it, and it went out. I lit my cigar stump again, and tried to keep\nawake by thinking. It was the first time I and Davies had been\nseparated for so long; yet so used had we grown to freedom from\ninterference that this would not have disturbed me in the least were\nit not for a sudden presentiment that on this first night of the\nsecond stage of our labours something would happen. All at once I\nheard a sound outside, a splashing footstep as of a man stepping in a\npuddle. I was wide awake in an instant, but never thought of shouting\n'Is that you, Davies?' for I knew in a flash that it was not he. It\nwas the slip of a stealthy man. Presently I heard another\nfootstep--the pad of a boot on the sand--this time close to my ear,\njust outside the hull; then some more, fainter and farther aft. I\ngently rose and peered aft through the skylight. A glimmer of light,\nreflected from below, was wavering over the mizzen-mast and bumpkin;\nit had nothing to do with the riding-light, which hung on the\nforestay. My prowler, I understood, had struck a match and was\nreading the name on the stern. How much farther would his curiosity\ncarry him? The match went out, and footsteps were audible again. Then\na strong, guttural voice called in German, 'Yacht ahoy!' I kept\nsilence. 'Yacht ahoy!' a little louder this time. A pause, and then a\nvibration of the hull as boots scraped on it and hands grasped the\ngunwale. My visitor was on deck. I bobbed down, sat on the sofa, and\nI heard him moving along the deck, quickly and confidently, first\nforward to the bows, where he stopped, then back to the companion\namidships. Inside the cabin it was pitch dark, but I heard his boots\non the ladder, feeling for the steps. In another moment he would be\nin the doorway lighting his second match. Surely it was darker than\nbefore? There had been a little glow from the riding-lamp reflected\non to the skylight, but it had disappeared. I looked up, realized,\nand made a fool of myself. In a few seconds more I should have seen\nmy visitor face to face, perhaps had an interview: but I was new to\nthis sort of work and lost my head. All I thought of was Davies's\nlast words, and saw him astray on the sands, with no light to guide\nhim back, the tide rising, and a heavy load. I started up\ninvoluntarily, bumped against the table, and set the stove jingling.\nA long step and a grab at the ladder, but just too late! I grasped\nsomething damp and greasy, there was tugging and hard breathing, and\nI was left clasping a big sea-boot, whose owner I heard jump on to\nthe sand and run. I scrambled out, vaulted overboard, and followed\nblindly by the sound. He had doubled round the bows of the yacht, and\nI did the same, ducked under the bowsprit, forgetting the bobstay,\nand fell violently on my head, with all the wind knocked out of me by\na wire rope and block whose strength and bulk was one of the glories\nof the _Dulcibella_. I struggled on as soon as I got some breath, but\nmy invisible quarry was far ahead. I pulled off my heavy boots,\ncarried them, and ran in my stockings, promptly cutting my foot on\nsome cockle-shells. Pursuit was hopeless, and a final stumble over a\nbit of driftwood sent me sprawling with agony in my toes.\n\nLimping back, I decided that I had made a very poor beginning as an\nactive adventurer. I had gained nothing, and lost a great deal of\nbreath and skin, and did not even know for certain where I was. The\nyacht's light was extinguished, and, even with Wangeroog Lighthouse\nto guide me, I found it no easy matter to find her. She had no anchor\nout, if the tide rose. And how was Davies to find her? After much\nfeeble circling I took to lying flat at intervals in the hopes of\nseeing her silhouetted against the starry sky. This plan succeeded at\nlast, and with relief and humility I boarded her, relit the\nriding-light, and carried off the kedge anchor. The strange boot lay\nat the foot of the ladder, but it told no tales when I examined it.\nIt was eleven o'clock, past low water. Davies was cutting it fine if\nhe was to get aboard without the dinghy's help. But eventually he\nreappeared in the most prosaic way, exhausted with his heavy load,\nbut full of talk about his visit ashore. He began while we were still\non deck.\n\n'Look here, we ought to have settled more about what we're to say\nwhen we're asked questions. I chose a quiet-looking shop, but it\nturned out to be a sort of inn, where they were drinking pink\ngin--all very friendly, as usual, and I found myself under a fire of\nquestions. I said we were on our way back to England. There was the\nusual rot about the smallness of the boat, etc. It struck me that we\nshould want some other pretence for going so slow and stopping to\nexplore, so I had to bring in the ducks, though goodness knows we\ndon't want to waste time over _them._ The subject wasn't quite a\nsuccess. They said it was too early--jealous, I suppose; but then two\nfellows spoke up, and asked to be taken on to help. Said they would\nbring their punt; without local help we should do no good. All true\nenough, no doubt, but what a nuisance they'd be. I got out of it----'\n\n'It's just as well you did,' I interposed. 'We shall never be able to\nleave the boat by herself. I believe we're watched,' and I related my\nexperience.\n\n'H'm! It's a pity you didn't see who it was. Confound that bobstay!'\n(his tactful way of reflecting on my clumsiness); 'which way did he\nrun?' I pointed vaguely into the west. 'Not towards the island? I\nwonder if it's someone off one of those galliots. There are three\nanchored in the channel over there; you can see their lights. You\ndidn't hear a boat pulling off?'\n\nI explained that I had been a miserable failure as a detective.\n\n'You've done jolly well, I think,' said Davies. 'If you had shouted\nwhen you first heard him we should know less still. And we've got a\nboot, which may come in useful. Anchor out all right? Let's get\nbelow.'\n\nWe smoked and talked till the new flood, lapping softly round the\n_Dulcibella_, raised her without a jar.\n\nOf course, I argued, there might be nothing in it. The visitor might\nhave been a commonplace thief; an apparently deserted yacht was a\ntempting bait. Davies scouted this possibility from the first.\n\n'They're not like that in Germany,' he said. 'In Holland, if you\nlike, they'll do anything. And I don't like that turning out of the\nlantern to gain time, if we were away.'\n\nNor did I. In spite of my blundering in details, I welcomed the\nincident as the first concrete proof that the object of our quest was\nno mare's nest. The next point was what was the visitor's object? If\nto search, what would he have found?\n\n'The charts, of course, with all our corrections and notes, and the\nlog. They'd give us away,' was Davies's instant conclusion. Not\nhaving his faith in the channel theory, I was lukewarm about his\nprecious charts.\n\n'After all, we're doing nothing wrong, as you've often said\nyourself,' I said.\n\nStill, as a true index to our mode of life they were the only things\non board that could possibly compromise us or suggest that we were\nanything more than eccentric young Englishmen cruising for sport\n(witness the duck-guns) and pleasure. We had two sets of charts,\nGerman and English. The former we decided to use in practice, and to\nhide, together with the log, if occasion demanded. My diary, I\nresolved, should never leave my person. Then there were the naval\nbooks. Davies scanned them with a look I knew well.\n\n'There are too many of them,' he said, in the tone of a cook fixing\nthe fate of superfluous kittens. 'Let's throw them overboard. They're\nvery old anyhow, and I know them by heart.'\n\n'Well, not here!' I protested, for he was laying greedy hands on the\nshelf; 'they'll be found at low water. In fact, I should leave them\nas they are. You had them when you were here before, and Dollmann\nknows you had them. If you return without them, it will look queer.'\nThey were spared.\n\nThe English charts, being relatively useless, though more suitable to\nour _r\u00c3\u00b4le_ as English yachtsmen, were to be left in evidence, as\nshining proofs of our innocence. It was all delightfully casual, I\ncould not help thinking. A seven-ton yacht does not abound in (dry)\nhiding-places, and we were helpless against a drastic search. If\nthere _were_ secrets on this coast to guard, and we were suspected as\nspies, there was nothing to prevent an official visit and warning.\nThere need be no prowlers scuttling off when alarmed, unless indeed\nit was thought wisest to let well alone, if we _were_ harmless, and\nnot to arouse suspicions where there were none. Here we lost\nourselves in conjecture. Whose agent was the prowler? If Dollmann's,\ndid Dollmann know now that the _Dulcibella_ was safe, and back in the\nregion he had expelled her from? If so, was he likely to return to\nthe policy of violence? We found ourselves both glancing at the duck-guns\nstrung up under the racks, and then we both laughed and looked\nfoolish. 'A war of wits, and not of duck-guns,' I opined. 'Let's look\nat the chart.'\n\n[Illustration: Map B of East Friesland.]\n\nThe reader is already familiar with the general aspect of this\nsingular region, and I need only remind him that the mainland is that\ndistrict of Prussia which is known as East Friesland. It is a _[See\nMap B]_ short, flat-topped peninsula, bounded on the west by the Ems\nestuary and beyond that by Holland, and on the east by the Jade\nestuary; a low-lying country, containing great tracts of marsh and\nheath, and few towns of any size; on the north side none. Seven\nislands lie off the coast. All, except Borkum, which is round, are\nattenuated strips, slightly crescent-shaped, rarely more than a mile\nbroad, and tapering at the ends; in length averaging about six miles,\nfrom Norderney and Juist, which are seven and nine respectively, to\nlittle Baltrum, which is only two and a half.\n\nOf the shoal spaces which lie between them and the mainland,\ntwo-thirds dry at low-water, and the remaining third becomes a system\nof lagoons whose distribution is controlled by the natural drift of\nthe North Sea as it forces its way through the intervals between the\nislands. Each of these intervals resembles the bar of a river, and is\nobstructed by dangerous banks, over which the sea pours at every tide\nscooping out a deep pool. This fans out and ramifies to east and west\nas the pent-up current frees itself, encircles the islands, and\nspreads over the intervening flats. But the farther it penetrates the\nless coursing force it has, and as a result no island is girt\ncompletely by a low-water channel. About midway at the back of each\nof them is a 'watershed', only covered for five or six hours out of\nthe twelve. A boat, even of the lightest draught, navigating behind\nthe islands must choose its moment for passing these. As to\nnavigability, the _North Sea Pilot_ sums up the matter in these dry\nterms: 'The channels dividing these islands from each other and the\nshore afford to the small craft of the country the means of\ncommunication between the Ems and the Jade, to which description of\nvessels only they are available.' The islands are dismissed with a\nbrief note or two about beacons and lights.\n\nThe more I looked at the chart the more puzzled I became. The islands\nwere evidently mere sandbanks, with a cluster of houses and a church\non each, the only hint of animation in their desolate _ensemble_\nbeing the occasional word 'Bade-strand', suggesting that they were\nvisited in the summer months by a handful of townsfolk for the\nsea-bathing. Norderney, of course, was conspicuous in this respect;\nbut even its town, which I know by repute as a gay and fashionable\nwatering-place, would be dead and empty for some months in the year,\nand could have no commercial importance. No man could do anything on\nthe mainland coast--a monotonous line of dyke punctuated at intervals\nby an infinitesimal village. Glancing idly at the names of these\nvillages, I noticed that they most of them ended in siel--a repulsive\ntermination, that seemed appropriate to the whole region. There were\nCarolinensiel, Bensersiel, etc. Siel means either a sewer or a\nsluice, the latter probably in this case, for I noticed that each\nvillage stood at the outlet of a little stream which evidently\ncarried off the drainage of the lowlands behind. A sluice, or lock,\nwould be necessary at the mouth, for at high tide the land is below\nthe level of the sea. Looking next at the sands outside, I noticed\nthat across them and towards each outlet a line of booms was marked,\nshowing that there was some sort of tidal approach to the village,\nevidently formed by the scour of the little stream.\n\n'Are we going to explore those?' I asked Davies.\n\n'I don't see the use,' he answered; 'they only lead to those potty\nlittle places. I suppose local galliots use them.'\n\n'How about your torpedo-boats and patrol-boats?'\n\n'They _might,_ at certain tides. But I can't see what value they'd\nbe, unless as a refuge for a German boat in the last resort. They\nlead to no harbours. Wait! There's a little notch in the dyke at\nNeuharlingersiel and Dornumersiel, which may mean some sort of a quay\narrangement, but what's the use of that?'\n\n'We may as well visit one or two, I suppose?'\n\n'I suppose so; but we don't want to be playing round villages.\nThere's heaps of really important work to do, farther out.'\n\n'Well, what _do_ you make of this coast?'\n\nDavies had nothing but the same old theory, but he urged it with a\nforce and keenness that impressed me more deeply than ever.\n\n'Look at those islands!' he said. 'They're clearly the old line of\ncoast, hammered into breaches by the sea. The space behind them is\nlike an immense tidal harbour, thirty miles by five, and they screen\nit impenetrably. It's absolutely _made_ for shallow war-boats under\nskilled pilotage. They can nip in and out of the gaps, and dodge\nabout from end to end. On one side is the Ems, on the other the big\nestuaries. It's a perfect base for torpedo-craft.'\n\nI agreed (and agree still), but still I shrugged my shoulders.\n\n'We go on exploring, then, in the same way?'\n\n'Yes; keeping a sharp look-out, though. Remember, we shall always be\nin sight of land now.'\n\n'What's the glass doing?'\n\n'Higher than for a long time. I hope it won't bring fog. I know this\ndistrict is famous for fogs, and fine weather at this time of the\nyear is bad for them anywhere. I would rather it blew, if it wasn't\nfor exploring those gaps, where an on-shore wind would be nasty.\nSix-thirty to-morrow; not later. I think I'll sleep in the saloon for\nthe future, after what happened to-night.'\n\n\n\n\nXV. Bensersiel\n\n[For this chapter see Map B.]\n\n\nTHE decisive incidents of our cruise were now fast approaching.\nLooking back on the steps that led to them, and anxious that the\nreader should be wholly with us in our point of view, I think I\ncannot do better than give extracts from my diary of the next three\ndays:\n\n'16th _Oct._ (up at 6.30, yacht high and dry). Of the three galliots\nout at anchor in the channel yesterday, only one is left ... I took\nmy turn with the breakers this morning and walked to Wangeroog, whose\nvillage I found half lost in sand drifts, which are planted with\ntufts of marram-grass in mathematical rows, to give stability and\nprevent a catastrophe like that at Pompeii. A friendly grocer told me\nall there is to know, which is little. The islands are what we\nthought them--barren for the most part, with a small fishing\npopulation, and a scanty accession of summer visitors for bathing.\nThe season is over now, and business slack for him. There is still,\nhowever, a little trade with the mainland in galliots and lighters, a\nfew of which come from the \"siels\" on the mainland. \"Had these\nharbours?\" I asked. \"Mud-holes!\" he replied, with a contemptuous\nlaugh. (He is a settler in these wilds, not a native.) Said he had\nheard of schemes for improving them, so as to develop the islands as\nhealth-resorts, but thought it was only a wild speculation.\n\n'A heavy tramp back to the yacht, nearly crushed by impedimenta.\nWhile Davies made yet another trip, I stalked some birds with a gun,\nand obtained what resembled a specimen of the smallest variety of\njack-snipe, and small at that; but I made a great noise, which I hope\npersuaded somebody of the purity of our motives.\n\n'We weighed anchor at one o'clock, and in passing the anchored\ngalliot took a good look at her. 'Kormoran' was on her stern; otherwise\nshe was just like a hundred others. Nobody was on deck.\n\n'We spent the whole afternoon till dark exploring the Harle, or gap\nbetween Wangeroog and Spiekeroog; the sea breaking heavily on the\nbanks outside ... Fine as the day was, the scene from the offing was\ndesolate to the last degree. The naked spots of the two islands are\nhideous in their sterility: melancholy bits of wreck-wood their only\nrelief, save for one or two grotesque beacons, and, most _bizarre_ of\nall, a great church-tower, standing actually _in_ the water, on the\nnorth side of Wangeroog, a striking witness to the encroachment of\nthe sea. On the mainland, which was barely visible, there was one\nvery prominent landmark, a spire, which from the chart we took to be\nthat of _Esens,_ a town four miles inland.\n\n'The days are growing short. Sunset is soon after five, and an hour\nlater it is too dark to see booms and buoys distinctly. The tides\nalso are awkward just now.\n\n(I exclude all the technicalities that I can, but the reader should\ntake note that the tide-table is very important henceforward.)\n\n'High-water at morning and evening is between five and six--just at\ntwilight. For the night, we groped with the lead into the Muschel\nBalge, the tributary channel which laps round the inside of\nSpiekeroog, and lay in two fathoms, clear of the outer swell, but\nrolling a little when the ebb set in strong against the wind.\n\n'A galliot passed us, going west, just as we were stowing sails; too\ndark to see her name. Later, we saw her anchor-light higher up our\nchannel.\n\n'The great event of the day has been the sighting of a small German\ngunboat, steaming slowly west along the coast. That was about\nhalf-past four, when we were sounding along the Harle.\n\n'Davies identified her at once as the _Blitz_, Commander von Br\u00c3\u00bcning's\ngunboat. We wondered if he recognized the _Dulcibella_, but, anyway,\nshe seemed to take no notice of us and steamed slowly on. We quite\nexpected to fall in with her when we came to the islands, but the\nactual sight of her has excited us a good deal. She is an ugly,\ncranky little vessel, painted grey, with one funnel. Davis is\ncontemptuous about her low freeboard forward; says he would rather go\nto sea in the 'Dulce'. He has her dimensions and armament (learnt from\nBrassey) at his fingers' ends: one hundred and forty feet by\ntwenty-five, one 4.9 gun, one 3.4, and four maxims--an old type. Just\ngoing to bed; a bitterly cold night.\n\n'_Oct_. 17--Glass falling heavily this morning, to our great\ndisgust. Wind back in the SW and much warmer. Starting at 5.30 we\ntacked on the tide over the \"watershed\" behind Spiekeroog. So did\nthe galliot we had seen last night, but we again missed identifying\nher, as she weighed anchor before we came up to her berth. Davies,\nhowever, swore she was the 'Kormoran'. We lost sight of her altogether\nfor the greater part of the day, which we spent in exploring the\nOtzumer Ee (the gap between Langeoog and Spiekeroog), now and then\nfiring some perfunctory shots at seals and sea-birds... (nautical\ndetails omitted). . . In the evening we were hurrying back to an\ninside anchorage, when we made a bad mistake; did, in fact, what we\nhad never done before, ran aground on the very top of high water, and\nare now sitting hard and fast on the edge of the Rute Flat, south of\nthe east spit of Langeoog. The light was bad, and a misplaced boom\ntricked us; kedging-off failed, and at 8 p.m. we were left on a\nperfect Ararat of sand, and only a yard or two from that accursed\nboom, which is perched on the very summit, as a lure to the unwary.\nIt is going to blow hard too, though that is no great matter, as we\nare sheltered by banks on the sou'-west and nor'-west sides, the\nlikely quarters. We hope to float at 6.15 to-morrow morning, but to\nmake sure of being able to get her off, we have been transferring\nsome ballast to the dinghy, by way of lightening the yacht--a horrid\nbusiness handling the pigs of lead, heavy, greasy, and black. The\nsaloon is an inferno, the deck like a collier's, and ourselves like\nsweeps.\n\n'The anchors are laid out, and there is nothing more to be done.\n\n'_Oct._ 18--Half a gale from the sou'-west when we turned out, but\nit helped us to float off safely at six. The dinghy was very nearly\nswamped with the weight of lead in it, and getting the ballast back\ninto the yacht was the toughest job of all. We got the dinghy\nalongside, and Davies jumped in (nearly sinking it for good),\nbalanced himself, fended off, and, whenever he got a chance, attached\nthe pigs one by one on to a bight of rope, secured to the peak\nhalyards, on which I hoisted from the deck. It was touch and go for a\nfew minutes, and then easier.\n\n'It was nine before we had finished replacing the pigs in the hold, a\nfilthy but delicate operation, as they fit like a puzzle, and if one\nis out of place the floor-boards won't shut down. Coming on deck\nafter it, we saw to our surprise the _Blitz_, lying at anchor in the\nSchill Balje, inside Spiekeroog, about a mile and a half off. She\nmust have entered the Otzumer Ee at high-water for shelter from the\ngale; a neat bit of work for a vessel of her size, as Davies says she\ndraws nine-foot-ten, and there can't be more than twelve on the bar\nat high-water neaps. Several smacks had run in too, and there were\ntwo galliots farther up our channel, but we couldn't make out if the\n'Kormoran' was one.\n\n'When the banks uncovered we lay more quietly, so landed and took a\nlong, tempestuous walk over the Rute, with compass and notebooks.\nReturning at two, we found the glass tumbling down almost visibly.\n\n'I suggested running for Bensersiel, one of the mainland villages\nsouth-west of us, on the evening flood, as it seemed just the right\nopportunity, if we were to visit one of those \"siels\" at all. Davies\nwas very lukewarm, but events overcame him. At 3.30 a black, ragged\ncloud, appearing to trail into the very sea, brought up a terrific\nsquall. This passed, and there was a deathly pause of ten minutes\nwhile the whole sky eddied as with smoke-wreaths. Then an icy puff\nstruck us from the north-west, rapidly veering till it reached\nnorth-east; there it settled and grew harder every moment.\n\n'\"Sou'-west to north-east--only the worst sort do that,\" said Davies.\n\n'The shift to the east changed the whole situation (as shifts often\nhave before), making the Rute Flats a lee shore, while to windward\nlay the deep lagoons of the Otzumer Ee, bounded indeed by Spiekeroog,\nbut still offering a big drift for wind and sea. We had to clear out\nsharp, to set the mizzen. It was out of the question to beat to\nwindward, for it was blowing a hurricane in a few minutes. We must go\nto leeward, and Davies was for running farther in well behind the\nJans sand, and not risking Bensersiel. A blunder of mine, when I went\nto the winch to get up anchor, settled the question. Thirty out of\nour forty fathoms of chain were out. Confused by the motion and a\nblinding sleet-shower that had come on, and forgetting the tremendous\nstrain on the cable, I cast the slack off the bitts and left it\nloose. There was then only one turn of the chain round the drum,\nenough in ordinary weather to prevent it running out. But now my\nfirst heave on the winch-lever started it slipping, and in an instant\nit was whizzing out of the hawse-pipe and overboard. I tried to stop\nit with my foot, stumbled at a heavy plunge of the yacht, heard\nsomething snap below, and saw the last of it disappear. The yacht\nfell off the wind, and drifted astern. I shouted, and had the sense\nto hoist the reefed foresail at once. Davies had her in hand in no\ntime, and was steering south-west. Going aft I found him cool and\ncharacteristic.\n\n'\"Doesn't matter,\" he said; \"anchor's buoyed. (Ever since leaving the\nElbe we had had a buoy-line on our anchor against the emergency of\nhaving to slip our cable and run. For the same reason the end of the\nchain was not made permanently fast below.) We'll come back to-morrow\nand get it. Can't now. Should have had to slip it anyhow; wind and sea\ntoo strong. We'll try for Bensersiel. Can't trust to a warp and kedge\nout here.\"\n\n'An exciting run it was, across country, so to speak, over an\nunboomed watershed; but we had bearings from our morning's walk.\nShoal water all the way and a hollow sea breaking everywhere. We soon\nmade out the Bensersiel booms, but even under mizzen and foresail\nonly we travelled too fast, and had to heave to outside them, for the\nchannel looked too shallow still. We lowered half the centreboard\nand kept her just holding her own to windward, through a most trying\nperiod. In the end had to run for it sooner than we meant, as we were\nsagging to leeward in spite of all, and the light was failing. Bore\nup at _5.15_, and raced up the channel with the booms on our left\nscarcely visible in the surf and rising water. Davies stood forward,\nsignalling--port, starboard, or steady--with his arms, while I\nwrestled with the helm, flung from side to side and flogged by\nwave-tops. Suddenly found a sort of dyke on our right just covering\nwith sea. The shore appeared through scud, and men on a quay\nshouting. Davies brandished his left arm furiously; I ported hard,\nand we were in smoother water. A few seconds more and we were\nwhizzing through a slit between two wood jetties. Inside a small\nsquare harbour showed, but there was no room to round up properly and\nno time to lower sails. Davies just threw the kedge over, and it just\ngot a grip in time to check our momentum and save our bowsprit from\nthe quayside. A man threw us a rope and we brought up alongside,\nrather bewildered.\n\n'Not more so than the natives, who seemed to think we had dropped\nfrom the sky. They were very friendly, with an undercurrent of\ndisappointment, having expected salvage work outside, I think. All\nshowed embarrassing helpfulness in stowing sails, etc. We were\nrescued by a fussy person in uniform and spectacles, who swept them\naside and announced himself as the Custom-house officer (fancy such a\nthing in this absurd mud-hole!), marched down into the cabin, which\nwas in a fearful mess and wringing wet, and producing ink, pen, and a\nhuge printed form, wanted to know our cargo, our crew, our last port,\nour destination, our food, stores, and everything. No cargo\n(pleasure); captain, Davies; crew, me; last port, Brunsb\u00c3\u00bcttel;\ndestination, England. What spirits had we? Whisky, produced. What\nsalt? Tin of Cerebos, produced, and a damp deposit in a saucer. What\ncoffee? etc. Lockers searched, guns fingered, bunks rifled. Meanwhile\nthe German charts and the log, the damning clues to our purpose, were\nin full evidence, crying for notice which they did not get. (We had\nforgotten our precautions in the hurry of our start from the Rute.)\nWhen the huge form was as full as he could make it, he suddenly\nbecame human, talkative, and thirsty; and, when we treated him,\npatronizing. It seemed to dawn on him that, under our rough clothes\nand crust of brine and grime, we were two mad and wealthy\naristocrats, worthy _prot\u00c3\u00a9g\u00c3\u00a9s_ of a high official. He insisted on our\nbringing our cushions to dry at his house, and to get rid of him we\nconsented, for we were wet, hungry, and longing to change and wash.\nHe talked himself away at last, and we hid the log and charts; but he\nreturned, in the postmaster's uniform this time before we had\nfinished supper, and haled us and our cushions up through dark and\nmud to his cottage near the quay. To reach it we crossed a small\nbridge spanning what seemed to be a small river with sluice-gates,\njust as we had thought.\n\n'He showed his prizes to his wife, who was quite flustered by the\ndistinguished strangers, and received the cushions with awe; and next\nwe were carried off to the Gasthaus and exhibited to the village\ncircle, where we talked ducks and weather. (Nobody takes us\nseriously; I never felt less like a conspirator.) Our friend, who is\na feather-headed chatterbox, is enormously important about his\nridiculous little port, whose principal customer seems to be the\nLangeoog post-boat, a galliot running to and fro according to tide. A\nfew lighters also come down the stream with bricks and produce from\nthe interior, and are towed to the islands. The harbour has from five\nto seven feet in it for two hours out of twelve! Herr Schenkel talked\nus back to the yacht, which we found resting on the mud--and here we\nare. Davies pretends there are harbour smells, and says he won't be\nable to sleep; is already worrying about how to get away from here.\nAshore, they were saying that it's impossible, under sail, in strong\nnorth-east winds, the channel being too narrow to tack in. For my\npart I find it a huge relief to be in any sort of harbour after a\nfortnight in the open. There are no tides or anchors to think about,\nand no bumping or rolling. Fresh milk to-morrow!'\n\n\n\n\nXVI. Commander von Br\u00c3\u00bcning\n\n\nTO RESUME my story in narrative form.\n\nI was awakened at ten o'clock on the 19th, after a long and delicious\nsleep, by Davies's voice outside, talking his unmistakable German.\nLooking out, in my pyjamas, I saw him on the quay above in\nconversation with a man in a long mackintosh coat and a gold-laced\nnavy cap. He had a close-trimmed auburn beard, a keen, handsome face,\nand an animated manner. It was raining in a raw air.\n\nThey saw me, and Davies said: 'Hullo, Carruthers! Here's Commander\nvon Br\u00c3\u00bcning from the _Blitz_--that's \"meiner Freund\" Carruthers.'\n(Davies was deplorably weak in terminations.)\n\nThe Commander smiled broadly at me, and I inclined an uncombed head,\nwhile, for a moment, the quest was a dream, and I myself felt\nunutterably squalid and foolish. I ducked down, heard them parting,\nand Davies came aboard.\n\n'We're to meet him at the inn for a talk at twelve,' he said.\n\nHis news was that the _Blitz_'s steam-cutter had come in on the morning\ntide, and he had met von Br\u00c3\u00bcning when marketing at the inn. Secondly,\nthe 'Kormoran' had also come in, and was moored close by. It was as\nclear as possible, therefore, that the latter had watched us, and was\nin touch with the _Blitz_, and that both had seized the opportunity of\nour being cooped up in Bensersiel to take further stock of us. What\nhad passed hitherto? Nothing much. Von Br\u00c3\u00bcning had greeted Davies\nwith cordial surprise, and said he had wondered yesterday if it was\nthe _Dulcibella_ that he had seen anchored behind Langeoog. Davies had\nexplained that we had left the Baltic and were on our way home;\ntaking the shelter of the islands.\n\n'Supposing he comes on board and asks to see our log?' I said.\n\n'Pull it out,' said Davies, 'It's rot, this hiding, after all, I say.\nI rather funk this interview; what are we to say? It's not in my\nline.'\n\nWe resolved abruptly on an important change of plan, replaced the log\nand charts in the rack as the first logical step. They contained\nnothing but bearings, courses, and the bare data of navigation. To\nDavies they were hard-won secrets of vital import, to be lied for,\nhowever hard and distasteful lying was. I was cooler as to their\nvalue, but in any case the same thing was now in both our minds.\nThere would be great difficulties in the coming interview if we tried\nto be too clever and conceal the fact that we had been exploring. We\ndid not know how much von Br\u00c3\u00bcning knew. When had our surveillance by\nthe 'Kormoran' begun? Apparently at Wangeroog, but possibly in the\nestuaries, where we had not fired a shot at duck. Perhaps he knew\neven more--Dollmann's treachery, Davies's escape, and our subsequent\nmovements--we could not tell. On the other hand, exploration was\nknown to be a fad of Davies's, and in September he had made no secret\nof it.\n\nIt was safer to be consistent now. After breakfast we determined to\nfind out something about the 'Kormoran', which lay on the mud at the\nother side of the harbour, and accordingly addressed ourselves to two\nmighty sailors, whose jerseys bore the legend 'Post', and who towered\nconspicuous among a row of stolid Frisians on the quay, all gazing\ngravely down at us as at a curious bit of marine bric-\u00c3\u00a0-brac. The\ntwins (for such they proved to be) were most benignant giants, and\nasked us aboard the post-boat galliot for a chat. It was easy to\nbring the talk naturally round to the point we wished, and we soon\ngained some most interesting information, delivered in the broadest\nFrisian, but intelligible enough. They called the 'Kormoran' a Memmert\nboat, or 'wreck-works' boat. It seemed that off the western end of\n_Juist_, the island lying west of Norderney, there lay the bones of a\nFrench war-vessel, wrecked ages ago. She carried bullion which has\nnever been recovered, in spite of many efforts. A salvage company was\ntrying for it now, and had works on Memmert, an adjacent sandbank.\n'That is Herr Grimm, the overseer himself,' they said, pointing to\nthe bridge above the sluice-gates. (I call him 'Grimm' because it\ndescribes him exactly.) A man in a pilot jacket and peaked cap was\nleaning over the parapet.\n\n'What's he doing here?' I asked.\n\nThey answered that he was often up and down the coast, work on the\nwreck being impossible in rough weather. They supposed he was\nbringing cargo in his galliot from Wilhelmshaven, all the company's\nplant and stores coming from that port. He was a local man from\nAurich; an ex-tug skipper.\n\nWe discussed this information while walking out over the sands to see\nthe channel at low water.\n\n'Did you hear anything about this in September?' I asked.\n\n'Not a word. I didn't go to Juist. I would have, probably, if I\nhadn't met Dollmann.'\n\nWhat in the world did it mean? How did it affect our plans?\n\n'Look at his boots if we pass him,' was all Davies had to suggest.\n\nThe channel was now a ditch, with a trickle in it, running north by\neast, roughly, and edged by a dyke of withies for the first quarter\nof a mile. It was still blowing fresh from the north-east, and we saw\nthat exit was impossible in such a wind.\n\nSo back to the village, a paltry, bleak little place. We passed\nfriend Grimm on the bridge; a dark, clean-shaved, saturnine man,\nwearing _shoes._ Approaching the inn:\n\n'We haven't settled quite enough, have we?' said Davies. 'What about\nour future plans?'\n\n'Heaven knows, we haven't,' I said. 'But I don't see how we can. We\nmust see how things go. It's past twelve, and it won't do to be\nlate.'\n\n'Well, I leave it to you.'\n\n'All right, I'll do my best. All you've got to do is to be yourself\nand tell one lie, if need be, about the trick Dollmann played you.'\n\nThe next scene: von Br\u00c3\u00bcning, Davies, and I, sitting over coffee and\nK\u00c3\u00bcmmel at a table in a dingy inn-parlour overlooking the harbour and\nthe sea, Davies with a full box of matches on the table before him.\nThe Commander gave us a hearty welcome, and I am bound to say I liked\nhim at once, as Davies had done; but I feared him, too, for he had\nhonest eyes, but abominably clever ones.\n\nI had impressed on Davies to talk and question as freely and\nnaturally as though nothing uncommon had happened since he last saw\nvon Br\u00c3\u00bcning on the deck of the 'Medusa'. He must ask about\nDollmann--the mutual friend--at the outset, and, if questioned about\nthat voyage in his company to the Elbe, must lie like a trooper as to\nthe danger he had been in. This was the one clear and essential\nnecessity, where much was difficult. Davies did his duty with\nprecipitation, and blushed when he put his question, in a way that\nhorrified me, till I remembered that his embarrassment was due, and\nwould be ascribed, to another cause.\n\n'Herr Dollmann is away still, I think,' said von Br\u00c3\u00bcning. (So Davies\nhad been right at Brunsb\u00c3\u00bcttel.) 'Were you thinking of looking him up\nagain?' he added.\n\n'Yes,' said Davies, shortly.\n\n'Well, I'm sure he's away. But his yacht is back, I believe--and\nFr\u00c3\u00a4ulein Dollmann, I suppose.'\n\n'H'm!' said Davies; 'she's a very fine boat that.'\n\nOur host smiled, gazing thoughtfully at Davies, who was miserable. I\nsaw a chance, and took it mercilessly.\n\n'We can call on Fr\u00c3\u00a4ulein Dollmann, at least, Davies,' I said, with a\nmeaning smile at von Br\u00c3\u00bcning.\n\n'H'm!, said Davies; 'will he be back soon, do you think?'\n\nThe Commander had begun to light a cigar, and took his time in\nanswering. 'Probably,' he said, after some puffing, 'he's never away\nvery long. But you've seen them later than I have. Didn't you sail to\nthe Elbe together the day after I saw you last?'\n\n'Oh, part of the way,' said Davies, with great negligence. 'I haven't\nseen him since. He got there first; outsailed me.'\n\n'Gave you the slip, in fact?'\n\n'Of course he beat me; I was close-reefed. Besides----'\n\n'Oh, I remember; there was a heavy blow--a devil of a heavy blow. I\nthought of you that day. How did you manage?'\n\n'Oh, it was a fair wind; it wasn't far, you see.'\n\n'Grosse Gott! In _that_.' He nodded towards the window whence the\n_Dulcibella_s' taper mast could be seen pointing demurely heavenwards.\n\n'She's a splendid sea-boat,' said Davies, indignantly.\n\n'A thousand pardons!' said von Br\u00c3\u00bcning, laughing.\n\n'Don't shake my faith in her,' I put in. 'I've got to get to England\nin her.'\n\n'Heaven forbid; I was only thinking that there must have been some\nsea round the Scharhorn that day; a tame affair, no doubt, Herr\nDavies?'\n\n'Scharhorn?' said Davies, who did not catch the idiom in the latter\nsentence. 'Oh, we didn't go that way. We cut through the sands--by\nthe Telte.'\n\n'The Telte! In a north-west gale!' The Commander started, ceased to\nsmile, and only stared. (It was genuine surprise; I could swear it.\nHe had heard nothing of this before.)\n\n'Herr Dollmann knew the way,' said Davies, doggedly. 'He kindly\noffered to pilot me through, and I wouldn't have gone otherwise.'\nThere was an awkward little pause.\n\n'He led you well, it seems?' said von Br\u00c3\u00bcning.\n\n'Yes; there's a nasty surf there, though, isn't there? But it saves\nsix miles--and the Scharhorn. Not that I saved distance. I was fool\nenough to run aground.'\n\n'Ah!' said the other, with interest.\n\n'It didn't matter, because I was well inside then. Those sands are\ndifficult at high water. We've come back that way, you know.'\n\n('And we run aground every day,' I remarked, with resignation.)\n\n'Is that where the 'Medusa' gave you the slip?' asked von Br\u00c3\u00bcning,\nstill studying Davies with a strange look, which I strove anxiously\nto analyze.\n\n'She wouldn't have noticed,' said Davies. 'It was very thick and\nsqually--and she had got some way ahead. There was no need for her to\nstop, anyway. I got off all right; the tide was rising still. But, of\ncourse, I anchored there for the night.'\n\n'Where?'\n\n'Inside there, under the Hohenh\u00c3\u00b6rn,' said Davies, simply.\n\n'Under the _what_?'\n\n'The Hohenh\u00c3\u00b6rn.'\n\n'Go on--didn't they wait for you at Cuxhaven?'\n\n'I don't know; I didn't go that way.' The Commander looked more and\nmore puzzled.\n\n'Not by the ship canal, I mean. I changed my mind about it, because\nthe next day the wind was easterly. It would have been a dead beat\nacross the sands to Cuxhaven, while it was a fair wind straight out\nto the Eider River. So I sailed there, and reached the Baltic that\nway. It was all the same.'\n\nThere was another pause.\n\n'Well done, Davies,' I thought. He had told his story well, using no\nsubtlety. I knew it was exactly how he would have told it to anyone\nelse, if he had not had irrefutable proof of foul play.\n\nThe Commander laughed, suddenly and heartily.\n\n'Another liqueur?' he said. Then, to me: 'Upon my word, your friend\namuses me. It's impossible to make him spin a yarn. I expect he had a\nbad time of it.'\n\n'That's nothing to him,' I said; 'he prefers it. He anchored me the\nother day behind the Hohenh\u00c3\u00b6rn in a gale of wind; said it was safer\nthan a harbour, and more sanitary.'\n\n'I wonder he brought you here last night. It was a fair wind for\nEngland; and not very far.'\n\n'There was no pilot to follow, you see.'\n\n'With a charming daughter--no.'\n\nDavies frowned and glared at me. I was merciful and changed the\nsubject.\n\n'Besides,' I said, 'we've left our anchor and chain out there.' And I\nmade confession of my sin.\n\n'Well, as it's buoyed, I should advise you to pick it up as soon as\nyou can,' said von Br\u00c3\u00bcning, carelessly; 'or someone else will.'\n\n'Yes, by Jove! Carruthers,' said Davies, eagerly, 'we must get out on\nthis next tide.'\n\n'Oh, there's no hurry,' I said, partly from policy, partly because\nthe ease of the shore was on me. To sit on a chair upright is\nsomething of a luxury, however good the cause in which you have\ncrouched like a monkey over a table at the level of your knees, with\na reeking oil-stove at your ear.\n\n'They're honest enough about here, aren't they?' I added. While the\nwords were on my lips I remembered the midnight visitor at Wangeroog,\nand guessed that von Br\u00c3\u00bcning was leading up to a test. Grimm (if he\nwas the visitor) would have told him of his narrow escape from\ndetection, and reticence on our part would show we suspected\nsomething. I could have kicked myself, but it was not too late. I\ntook the bull by the horns, and, before the Commander could answer,\nadded:\n\n'By Jove! Davies, I forgot about that fellow at Wangeroog. The anchor\nmight be stolen, as he says.'\n\nDavies looked blank, but von Br\u00c3\u00bcning had turned to me.\n\n'We never dreamed there would be thieves among these islands,' I\nsaid, 'but the other night I nearly caught a fellow in the act. He\nthought the yacht was empty.'\n\nI described the affair in detail, and with what humour I could. Our\nhost was amused, and apologetic for the islanders.\n\n'They're excellent folk,' he said, 'but they're born with predatory\ninstincts. Their fathers made their living out of wrecks on this\ncoast, and the children inherit a weakness for plunder. When\nWangeroog lighthouse was built they petitioned the Government for\ncompensation, in perfect good faith. The coast is well lighted now,\nand windfalls are rare, but the sight of a stranded yacht, with the\nowners ashore, would inflame the old passion; and, depend upon it,\nsomeone has seen that anchor-buoy.'\n\nThe word 'wrecks' had set me tingling. Was it another test?\nImpossible to say; but audacity was safer than reserve, and might\nsave trouble in the future.\n\n'Isn't there the wreck of a treasure-ship somewhere farther west?' I\nasked. 'We heard of it at Wangeroog' (my first inaccuracy). 'They\nsaid a company was exploiting it.'\n\n'Quite right,' said the Commander, without a sign of embarrassment.\n'I don't wonder you heard of it. It's one of the few things folk have\nto talk about in these parts. It lies on Juister Riff, a shoal off\nJuist. _[see Map B]_ She was a French frigate, the _Corinne_, bound\nfrom Hamburg to Havre in 1811, when Napoleon held Hamburg as tight as\nParis. She carried a million and a half in gold bars, and was insured\nin Hamburg; foundered in four fathoms, broke up, and there lies the\ntreasure.'\n\n'Never been raised?'\n\n'No. The underwriters failed and went bankrupt, and the wreck came\ninto the hands of your English Lloyd's. It remained their property\ntill '75, but they never got at the bullion. In fact, for fifty years\nit was never scratched at, and its very position grew doubtful, for\nthe sand swallowed every stick. The rights passed through various\nhands, and in '86 were held by an enterprising Swedish company, which\nbrought modern appliances, dived, dredged, and dug, fished up a lot\nof timber and bric-\u00c3\u00a0-brac, and then broke. Since then, two Hamburg\nfirms have tackled the job and lost their capital. Scores of lives\nhave been spent over it, all told, and probably a million of money.\nStill there are the bars, somewhere.'\n\n'And what's being done now?'\n\n'Well, recently a small local company was formed. It has a dep\u00c3\u00b4t at\nMemmert, and is working with a good deal of perseverance. An engineer\nfrom Bremen was the principal mover, and a few men from Norderney and\nEmden subscribed the capital. By the way, our friend Dollmann is\nlargely interested in it.'\n\nOut of the corner of my eye I saw Davies's tell-tale face growing\ntroubled with inward questionings.\n\n'We mustn't get back to him,' I said, laughing. 'It's not fair to my\nfriend. But all this is very interesting. Will they ever get those\nbars?'\n\n'Ah! that's the point,' said von Br\u00c3\u00bcning, with a mysterious twinkle.\n'It's an undertaking of immense difficulty; for the wreck is wholly\ndisintegrated, and the gold, being the heaviest part of it, has, of\ncourse, sunk the deepest. Dredging is useless after a certain point;\nand the divers have to make excavations in the sand, and shore them\nup as best they can. Every gale nullifies half their labour, and\nweather like this of the last fortnight plays the mischief with the\nwork. Only this morning I met the overseer, who happens to be ashore\nhere. He was as black as thunder over prospects.'\n\n'Well, it's a romantic speculation,' I said. 'They deserve a return\nfor their money.'\n\n'I hope they'll get it,' said the Commander. 'The fact is, I hold a\nfew shares myself.'\n\n'Oh, I hope I haven't been asking indiscreet questions?'\n\n'Oh, dear no; all the world knows what I've told you. But you'll\nunderstand that one has to be reticent as to results in such a case.\nIt's a big stake, and the _title is none too sound._ There has been\nlitigation over it. Not that I worry much about my investment; for I\nshan't lose much by it at the worst. But it gives one an interest in\nthis abominable coast. I go and see how they're getting on sometimes,\nwhen I'm down that way.'\n\n'It _is_ an abominable coast,' I agreed heartily, 'though you won't\nget Davies to agree.'\n\n'It's a magnificent place for sailing,' said Davies, looking\nwistfully out over the storm-speckled grey of the North Sea.\n\nHe underwent some more chaff, and the talk passed to our cruising\nadventures in the Baltic and the estuaries. Von Br\u00c3\u00bcning\ncross-examined us with the most charming urbanity and skill. Nothing\nhe asked could cause us the slightest offence; and a responsive\nfrankness was our only possible course. So, date after date, and\nincident after incident, were elicited in the most natural way. As we\ntalked I was astonished to find how little there was that was worth\nconcealing, and heartily thankful that we had decided on candour. My\nfluency gave me the lead, and Davies followed me; but his own\npersonality was really our tower of strength. I realized that as I\nwatched the play of his eager features, and heard him struggle for\nexpression on his favourite hobby; all his pet phrases translated\ncrudely into the most excruciating German. He was convincing, because\nhe was himself.\n\n'Are there many like you in England?' asked von Br\u00c3\u00bcning once.\n\n'Like me? Of course--lots,' said Davies.\n\n'I wish there were more in Germany; they play at yachting\nover here--on shore half the time, drinking and loafing; paid crews,\nclean hands, white trousers; laid up in the middle of September.'\n\n'We haven't seen many yachts about, said Davies, politely.\n\nFor my part, I made no pretence of being a Davies. Faithful to my\nlower nature, I vowed the Germans were right, and, not without a\nsecret zest, drew a lurid picture of the horrors of crewless\ncruising, and the drudgery that my remorseless skipper inflicted on\nme. It was delightful to see Davies wincing when I described my first\nnight at Flensburg, for I had my revenge at last, and did not spare\nhim. He bore up gallantly under my jesting, but I knew very well by\nhis manner that he had not forgiven me my banter about the 'charming\ndaughter'.\n\n'You speak German well,' said von Br\u00c3\u00bcning.\n\n'I have lived in Germany,' said I.\n\n'Studying for a profession, I suppose?'\n\n'Yes,' said I, thinking ahead. 'Civil Service,' was my prepared\nanswer to the next question, but again (morbidly, perhaps) I saw a\npitfall. That letter from my chief awaiting me at Norderney? My name\nwas known, and we were watched. It might be opened. Lord, how casual\nwe have been!\n\n'May I ask what?'\n\n'The Foreign Office.' It sounded suspicious, but there it was.\n'Indeed--in the Government service? When do you have to be back?'\n\nThat was how the question of our future intentions was raised,\nprematurely by me; for two conflicting theories were clashing in my\nbrain. But the contents of the letter dogged me now, and 'when at a\nloss, tell the truth', was an axiom I was finding sound. So I\nanswered, 'Pretty soon, in about a week. But I'm expecting a letter\nat Norderney, which may give me an extension. Davies said it was a\ngood address to give,' I added, smiling.\n\n'Naturally,' said von Br\u00c3\u00bcning, dryly; the joke had apparently ceased\nto amuse him. 'But you haven't much time then, have you?' he added,\n'unless you leave your skipper in the lurch. It's a long way to\nEngland, and the season is late for yachts.'\n\nI felt myself being hurried.\n\n'Oh, you don't understand,' I explained; '_he's_ in no hurry. He's a\nman of leisure; aren't you, Davies?'\n\n'What?' said Davies.\n\nI translated my cruel question.\n\n'Yes,' said Davies, with simple pathos.\n\n'If I have to leave him I shan't be missed--as an able seaman, at\nleast. He'll just potter on down the islands, running aground and\nkedging-off, and arrive about Christmas.'\n\n'Or take the first fair gale to Dover,' laughed the Commander.\n\n'Or that. So, you see, we're in no hurry; and we never make plans.\nAnd as for a passage to England straight, I'm not such a coward as I\nwas at first, but I draw the line at that.'\n\n'You're a curious pair of shipmates; what's your point of view, Herr\nDavies?'\n\n'I like this coast,' said Davies. 'And--we want to shoot some ducks.'\nHe was nervous, and forgot himself. I had already satirized our\nsporting armament and exploits, and hoped the subject was disposed\nof. Ducks were pretexts, and might lead to complications. I\nparticularly wanted a free hand.\n\n'As to wild fowl,' said our friend, 'I would like to give you\ngentlemen some advice. There are plenty to be got, now that autumn\nweather has set in (you wouldn't have got a shot in September, Herr\nDavies; I remember your asking about them when I saw you last). And\neven now it's early for amateurs. In hard winter weather a child can\npick them up; but they're wild still, and want crafty hunting. You\nwant a local punt, and above all a local man (you could stow him in\nyour fo'c'sle), and to go to work seriously. Now, if you really wish\nfor sport, I could help you. I could get you a trustworthy----'\n\n'Oh, it's too good of you,' stammered Davies, in a more unhappy\naccent than usual. 'We can easily find one for ourselves. A man at\nWangeroog offered----'\n\n'Oh, did he?' interrupted von Br\u00c3\u00bcning, laughing. 'I'm not surprised.\nYou don't know the Frieslanders. They're guileless, as I said, but\nthey cling to their little perquisites.' (I translated to Davies.)\n'They've been cheated out of wrecks, and they're all the more\nsensitive about ducks, which are more lucrative than fish. A stranger\nis a poacher. Your man would have made slight errors as to time and\nplace.'\n\n'You said they were odd in their manner, didn't you, Davies?' I put\nin. 'Look here, this is very kind of Commander von Br\u00c3\u00bcning; but\nhadn't we better be certain of my plans before settling down to\nshoot? Let's push on direct to Norderney and get that letter of mine,\nand then decide. But we shan't see you again, I suppose, Commander?'\n\n'Why not? I am cruising westwards, and shall probably call at\nNorderney. Come aboard if you're there, won't you? I should like to\nshow you the _Blitz_.'\n\n'Thanks, very much,' said Davies, uneasily.\n\n'Thanks, very much,' said I, as heartily as I could.\n\nOur party broke up soon after this.\n\n'Well, gentlemen, I must take leave of you,' said our friend. 'I have\nto drive to Esens. I shall be going back to the _Blitz_ on the evening\ntide, but you'll be busy then with your own boat.'\n\nIt had been a puzzling interview, but the greatest puzzle was still\nto come. As we went towards the door, von Br\u00c3\u00bcning made a sign to me.\nWe let Davies pass out and remained standing.\n\n'One word in confidence with you, Herr Carruthers,' he said, speaking\nlow. 'You won't think me officious, I hope. I only speak out of keen\nregard for your friend. It is about the Dollmanns--you see how the\nland lies? I wouldn't encourage him.'\n\n'Thanks,' I said, 'but really----'\n\n'It's only a hint. He's a splendid young fellow, but if anything--you\nunderstand--too honest and simple. I take it you have influence with\nhim, and I should use it.'\n\n'I was not in earnest,' I said. 'I have never seen the Dollmanns; I\nthought they were friends of yours,' I added, looking him straight in\nthe eyes.\n\n'I know them, but'--he shrugged his shoulders--'I know everybody.'\n\n'What's wrong with them?' I said, point-blank.\n\n'Softly! Herr Carruthers. Remember, I speak out of pure friendliness\nto you as strangers, foreigners, and young. You I take to have\ndiscretion, or I should not have said a word. Still, I will add this.\nWe know very little of Herr Dollmann, of his origin, his antecedents.\nHe is half a Swede, I believe, certainly not a Prussian; came to\nNorderney three years ago, appears to be rich, and has joined in\nvarious commercial undertakings. Little scope about here? Oh, there\nis more enterprise than you think--development of bathing resorts,\nyou know, speculation in land on these islands. Sharp practice? Oh,\nno! he's perfectly straight in that way. But he's a queer fellow, of\neccentric habits, and--and, well, as I say, little is known of him.\nThat's all, just a warning. Come along.'\n\nI saw that to press him further was useless.\n\n'Thanks; I'll remember,' I said.\n\n'And look here,' he added, as we walked down the passage, 'if you\ntake my advice, you'll omit that visit to the 'Medusa' altogether.' He\ngave me a steady look, smiling gravely.\n\n'How much do you know, and what do you mean?' were the questions that\nthrobbed in my thoughts; but I could not utter them, so I said\nnothing and felt very young.\n\nOutside we joined Davies, who was knitting his brow over prospects.\n\n'It just comes of going into places like this,' he said to me. 'We\nmay be stuck here for days. Too much wind to tow out with the dinghy,\nand too narrow a channel to beat in.'\n\nVon Br\u00c3\u00bcning was ready with a new proposal.\n\n'Why didn't I think of it before?' he said. 'I'll tow you out in my\nlaunch. Be ready at 6.30; we shall have water enough then. My men\nwill send you a warp.'\n\nIt was impossible to refuse, but a sense of being personally\nconducted again oppressed me; and the last hope of a bed in the inn\nvanished. Davies was none too effusive either. A tug meant a pilot,\nand he had had enough of them.\n\n'He objects to towage on principle,' I said.\n\n'Just like him!' laughed the other. 'That's settled, then!' A dogcart\nwas standing before the inn door in readiness for von Br\u00c3\u00bcning. I was\ncurious about Esens and his business there. Esens, he said, was the\nprincipal town of the district, four miles inland.\n\n'I have to go there,' he volunteered, 'about a poaching case--a\nDutchman trawling inside our limits. That's my work, you know--police\nduty.'\n\nHad the words a deeper meaning?\n\n'Do you ever catch an Englishman?' I asked, recklessly.\n\n'Oh, very rarely; your countrymen don't come so far as this--except on\npleasure.' He bowed to us each and smiled.\n\n'Not much of that to be got in Bensersiel,' I laughed.\n\n'I'm afraid you'll have a dull afternoon. Look here. I know you can't\nleave your boat altogether, and it's no use asking Herr Davies; but\nwill _you_ drive into Esens with me and see a Frisian town--for what\nit's worth? You're getting a dismal impression of Friesland.'\n\nI excused myself, said I would stop with Davies; we would walk out over\nthe sands and prospect for the evening's sail.\n\n'Well, good-bye then,' he said, 'till the evening. Be ready for the\nwarp at 6.30.'\n\nHe jumped up, and the cart rattled off through the mud, crossed the\nbridge, and disappeared into the dreary hinterland.\n\n\n\n\nXVII. Clearing the Air\n\n\n'HAS he gone to get the police, do you think?' said Davies, grimly.\n\n'I don't think so,' said I. 'Let's go aboard before that Customs\nfellow buttonholes us.'\n\nA diminished row of stolid Frisians still ruminated over the\n_Dulcibella_. Friend Grimm was visible smoking on his forecastle. We\nwent on board in silence.\n\n'First of all, where exactly is Memmert?' I said.\n\nDavies pulled down the chart, said 'There,' and flung himself at full\nlength on a sofa.\n\nThe reader can see Memmert for himself. South of Juist, _[see Map B]_\nabutting on the Ems delta, lies an extensive sandbank called\nNordland, whose extreme western rim remains uncovered at the highest\ntides; the effect being to leave a C-shaped island, a mere paring of\nsand like a boomerang, nearly two miles long, but only 150 yards or\nso broad, of curiously symmetrical outline, except at one spot, where\nit bulges to the width of a quarter of a mile. On the English chart\nits nakedness was absolute, save for a beacon at the south; but the\nGerman chart marked a building at the point where the bulge occurs.\nThis was evidently the dep\u00c3\u00b4t. 'Fancy living there!' I thought, for\nthe very name struck cold. No wonder Grimm was grim; and no wonder he\nwas used to seek change of air. But the advantages of the site were\nobvious. It was remarkably isolated, even in a region where isolation\nis the rule; yet it was conveniently near the wreck, which, as we had\nheard, lay two miles out on the Juister Reef. Lastly, it was clearly\naccessible at any state of the tide, for the six-fathom channel of\nthe Ems estuary runs hard up to it on the south, and thence sends off\nan eastward branch which closely borders the southern horn, thus\noffering an anchorage at once handy, deep, and sheltered from seaward\ngales.\n\nSuch was Memmert, as I saw it on the chart, taking in its features\nmechanically, for while Davies lay there heedless and taciturn, a\npretence of interest was useless. I knew perfectly well what was\nbetween us, but I did not see why I should make the first move; for I\nhad a grievance too, an old one. So I sat back on my sofa and jotted\ndown in my notebook the heads of our conversation at the inn while it\nwas fresh in my memory, and strove to draw conclusions. But the\nsilence continuing and becoming absurd, I threw my pride to the\nwinds, and my notebook on the table.\n\n'I say, Davies,' I said, 'I'm awfully sorry I chaffed you about\nFr\u00c3\u00a4ulein Dollmann.' (No answer.) 'Didn't you see I couldn't help it?'\n\n'I wish to Heaven we had never come in here,' he said, in a hard\nvoice; 'it comes of landing _ever_.' (I couldn't help smiling at\nthis, but he wasn't looking at me.) 'Here we are, given away, moved\non, taken in charge, arranged for like Cook's tourists. I couldn't\nfollow your game--too infernally deep for me, but----' That stung me.\n\n'Look here,' I said, 'I did my best. It was you that muddled it. Why\ndid you harp on ducks?'\n\n'We could have got out of that. Why did you harp on everything\nidiotic--your letter, the Foreign Office, the 'Kormoran', the wreck,\nthe----?'\n\n'You're utterly unreasonable. Didn't you see what traps there were? I\nwas driven the way I went. We started unprepared, and we're jolly\nwell out of it.'\n\nDavies drove on blindly. 'It was bad enough telling all about the\nchannels and exploring----'\n\n'Why, you agreed to that yourself!'\n\n'I gave in to you. We can't explore any more now'.\n\n'There's the wreck, though.'\n\n'Oh, hang the wreck! It's all a blind, or he wouldn't have made so\nmuch of it. There are all these channels to be----'\n\n'Oh, hang the channels! I know we wanted a free hand, but we've got\nto go to Norderney some time, and if Dollmann's away----'\n\n'Why did you harp on Miss Dollmann?' said Davies.\n\nWe had worked round, through idle recrimination, to the real point of\ndeparture. I knew Davies was not himself, and would not return to\nhimself till the heart of the matter was reached.\n\n'Look here,' I said, 'you brought me out here to help you, because,\nas you say, I was clever, talked German, and--liked yachting (I\ncouldn't resist adding this). But directly you really _want_ me you\nturn round and go for me.'\n\n'Oh, I didn't mean all that, really,' said Davies; 'I'm sorry--I was\nworried.'\n\n'I know; but it's your own fault. You haven't been fair with me.\nThere's a complication in this business that you've never talked\nabout. I've never pressed you because I thought you would confide in\nme. You----'\n\n'I know I haven't,' said Davies.\n\n'Well, you see the result. Our hand was forced. To have said nothing\nabout Dollmann was folly--to have said he tried to wreck you was\nequal folly. The story we agreed on was the best and safest, and you\ntold it splendidly. But for two reasons I had to harp on the\ndaughter--one because your manner when they were mentioned was so\nconfused as to imperil our whole position. Two, because your story,\nthough the safest, was, at the best, suspicious. Even on your own\nshowing Dollmann treated you badly--discourteously, say: though you\npretended not to have seen it. You want a motive to neutralize that,\nand induce you to revisit him in a friendly way. I supplied it, or\nrather I only encouraged von Br\u00c3\u00bcning to supply it.'\n\n'Why revisit him, after all?' said Davies.\n\n'Oh, come----'\n\n'But don't you see what a hideous fix you've put me in? How caddish I\nfeel about it?'\n\nI did see, and I felt a cad myself, as his full distress came home to\nme. But I felt, too, that, whosesoever the fault, we had drifted into\na ridiculous situation, and were like characters in one of those\ntiresome plays where misunderstandings are manufactured and so\ncarefully sustained that the audience are too bored to wait for the\n_d\u00c3\u00a9nouement._ You can do that on the stage; but we wanted our\n_d\u00c3\u00a9nouement._\n\n'I'm very sorry,' I said, 'but I wish you had told me all about it.\nWon't you now? Just the bare, matter-of-fact truth. I hate sentiment,\nand so do you.'\n\n'I find it very difficult to tell people things,' said Davies,\n'things like this.' I waited. 'I did like her--very much.' Our eyes\nmet for a second, in which all was said that need be said, as between\ntwo of our phlegmatic race. 'And she's--separate from him. That was\nthe reason of all my indecisions.' he hurried on. 'I only told you\nhalf at Schlei. I know I ought to have been open, and asked your\nadvice. But I let it slide. I've been hoping all along that we might\nfind what we want and win the game without coming to close quarters\nagain.'\n\nI no longer wondered at his devotion to the channel theory, since,\nbuilt on conviction, it was thus doubly fortified.\n\n'Yet you always knew what might happen,' I said. 'At Schlei you spoke\nof \"settling with\" Dollmann.'\n\n'I know. When I thought of him I was mad. I made myself forget the\nother part.'\n\n'Which recurred at Brunsb\u00c3\u00bcttel?' I thought of the news we had there.\n\n'Yes.'\n\n'Davies, we must have no more secrets. I'm going to speak out. Are\nyou sure you've not misunderstood her? You say--and I'm willing to\nassume it--that Dollmann's a traitor and a murderer.'\n\n'Oh, hang the murder part!' said Davies, impatiently. 'What does\n_that_ matter?'\n\n'Well, traitor. Very good; but in that case I suspect his daughter.\nNo! let me go on. She was useful, to say the least. She encouraged\nyou--you've told me that--to make that passage with them.'\n\n'Stop, Carruthers,' said Davies, firmly. 'I know you mean kindly; but\nit's no use. I believe in her.'\n\nI thought for a moment.\n\n'In that case,' I said, 'I've something to propose. When we get out\nof this place let's sail straight away to England.' '(There,\nCommander von Br\u00c3\u00bcning,' I thought, 'you never can say I neglected\nyour advice.')\n\n'No!' exclaimed Davies, starting up and facing me. 'I'm hanged if we\nwill. Think what's at stake. Think of that traitor--plotting with\nGermans. My God!'\n\n'Very good,' I said. 'I'm with you for going on. But let's face\nfacts. We _must_ scotch Dollmann. We can't do so without hurting\n_her_.'\n\n'Can't we _possibly_?'\n\n'Of course not; be sensible, man. Face that. Next point; it's absurd\nto hope that we need not revisit them--it's ten to one that we must,\nif we're to succeed. His attempt on you is the whole foundation of\nour suspicions. And we don't even know for certain who he _is_ yet.\nWe're committed, I know, to going straight to Norderney now; but even\nif we weren't, should we do any good by exploring and prying? It's\nvery doubtful. We know we're watched, if not suspected, and that\ndisposes of nine-tenths of our power. The channels? Yes, but is it\nlikely they'll let us learn them by heart, if they're of such vital\nimportance, even if we are thought to be _bona fide_ yachtsmen? And,\nseriously, apart from their value in war, which I don't deny, are\nthey at the root of this business? But we'll talk about that in a\nmoment. The point now is, what shall we do if we meet the Dollmanns?'\n\nBeads of sweat stood on Davies's brow. I felt like a torturer, but it\ncould not be helped. 'Tax him with having wrecked you? Our quest\nwould be at an end! We must be friendly. You must tell the story you\ntold to-day, and chance his believing it. If he does, so much the\nbetter; if he doesn't, he won't dare say so, and we still have\nchances. We gain time, and have a tremendous hold on him--_if_ we're\nfriendly.' Davies winced. I gave another turn to the screw. 'Friendly\nwith them _both,_ of course. You were before, you know; you liked her\nvery much--you must seem to still.'\n\n'Oh, stop your infernal logic.'\n\n'Shall we chuck it and go to England?' I asked again, as an\ninquisitor might say, 'Have you had enough?' No answer. I went on:\n'To make it easier, you _do_ like her still.' I had roused my victim\nat last.\n\n'What the devil do you mean, Carruthers? That I'm to trade on my\nliking for her--on her innocence, to--good God! what _do_ you mean?'\n\n'No, no, not that. I'm not such a cad, or such a fool, or so ignorant\nof you. If she knows nothing of her father's character and likes\nyou--and you like her--and you are what you are--oh Heavens! man,\nface it, realize it! But what I mean is this: is she, _can_ she be,\nwhat you think? Imagine his position if we're right about him; the\nvilest creature on God's earth--a disgraceful past to have been\ndriven to this--in the pay of Germany. I want to spare you misery.' I\nwas going to add: 'And if you're on your guard, to increase our\nchances.' But the utter futility of such suggestions silenced me.\nWhat a plan I had foreshadowed! An enticing plan and a fair one, too,\nas against such adversaries; turning this baffling cross-current to\nadvantage as many a time we had worked eddies of an adverse tide in\nthese difficult seas. But Davies was Davies, and there was an end of\nit; his faith and simplicity shamed me. And the pity of it, the\ncruelty of it, was that his very qualities were his last torture,\nraising to the acutest pitch the conflict between love and\npatriotism. Remember that the latter was his dominant life-motive,\nand that here and now was his chance--if you would gauge the\nbitterness of that conflict.\n\nIt was in its last throes now. His elbows were on the table, and his\ntwitching hands pressed on his forehead. He took them away.\n\n'Of course we must go on. It can't be helped, that's all.'\n\n'And you believe in her?'\n\n'I'll remember what you've said. There may be some way out. And--I'd\nrather not talk about that any more. What about the wreck?'\n\nFurther argument was futile. Davies by an effort seemed to sweep the\nsubject from his thoughts, and I did my best to do the same. At any\nrate the air was cleared--we were friends; and it only remained to\ngrapple with the main problem in the light of the morning's\ninterview.\n\nEvery word that I could recollect of that critical conversation I\nreviewed with Davies, who had imperfectly understood what he had not\nbeen directly concerned in; and, as I did so, I began to see with\nwhat cleverness each succeeding sentence of von Br\u00c3\u00bcning's was\ndesigned to suit both of two contingencies. If we were innocent\ntravellers, he was the genial host, communicative and helpful. If we\nwere spies, his tactics had been equally applicable. He had outdone\nus in apparent candour, hiding nothing which he knew we would\ndiscover for ourselves, and contriving at the same time both to gain\nknowledge and control of our movements, and to convey us warnings,\nwhich would only be understood if we were guilty, that we were\nplaying an idle and perilous game, and had better desist. But in one\nrespect we had had the advantage, and that was in the version Davies\nhad given of his stranding on the Hohenh\u00c3\u00b6rn. Inscrutable as our\nquestioner was, he let it appear not only that the incident was new\nto him, but that he conjectured at its sinister significance. A\nlittle cross-examination on detail would have been fatal to Davies's\nversion; but that was where our strength lay; he dared not\ncross-examine for fear of suggesting to Davies suspicions which he\nmight never have felt. Indeed, I thought I detected that fear\nunderlying his whole attitude towards us, and it strengthened a\nconviction which had been growing in me since Grimm's furtive\nmidnight visit, that the secret of this coast was of so important and\ndelicate a nature that rather than attract attention to it at all,\novert action against intruders would be taken only in the last\nresort, and on irrefragable proofs of guilty intention.\n\nNow for our clues. I had come away with two, each the germ of a\ndistinct theory, and both obscured by the prevailing ambiguity. Now,\nhowever, as we thumbed the chart and I gave full rein to my fancy,\none of them, the idea of Memmert, gained precision and vigour every\nmoment. True, such information as we had about the French wreck and\nhis own connection with it was placed most readily at our disposal by\nvon Br\u00c3\u00bcning; but I took it to be information calculated only to\nforestall suspicion, since he was aware that we already associated\nhim with Dollmann, possibly also with Grimm, and it was only likely\nthat in the ordinary course we should learn that the trio were\njointly concerned in Memmert. So much for the facts; as for the\nconstruction he wished us to put on them, I felt sure it was\nabsolutely false. He wished to give us the impression that the buried\ntreasure itself was at the root of any mystery we might have scented.\nI do not know if the reader fully appreciated that astute\nsuggestion--the hint that secrecy as to results was necessary owing\nboth to the great sum at stake and the flaw in the title, which he\nhad been careful to inform us had passed through British hands. What\nhe meant to imply was, 'Don't be surprised if you have midnight\nvisitors; Englishmen prowling along this coast are suspected of being\nLloyd's agents.' An ingenious insinuation, which, at the time it was\nmade, had caused me to contemplate a new and much more commonplace\nsolution of our enigma than had ever occurred to us; but it was only\na passing doubt, and I dismissed it altogether now.\n\nThe fact was, it either explained everything or nothing. As long as\nwe held to our fundamental assumption--that Davies had been decoyed\ninto a death-trap in September--it explained nothing. It was too\nfantastic to suppose that the exigencies of a commercial speculation\nwould lead to such extremities as that. We were not in the South Sea\nIslands; nor were we the puppets of a romance. We were in Europe,\ndealing not only with a Dollmann, but with an officer of the German\nImperial Navy, who would scarcely be connected with a commercial\nenterprise which could conceivably be reduced to forwarding its\nobjects in such a fashion. It was shocking enough to find him in\nrelations with such a scoundrel at all, but it was explicable if the\nmotive were imperial--not so if it were financial. No; to accept the\nsuggestion we must declare the whole quest a mare's nest from\nbeginning to end; the attempt on Davies a delusion of his own fancy,\nthe whole structure we had built on it, baseless.\n\n'Well,' I can hear the reader saying, 'why not? You, at any rate,\nwere always a little sceptical.'\n\nGranted; yet I can truthfully say I scarcely faltered for a moment.\nMuch had happened since Schlei Fiord. I had seen the mechanism of the\ndeath-trap; I had lived with Davies for a stormy fortnight, every\nhour of which had increased my reliance on his seamanship, and also,\ntherefore, on his account of an event which depended largely for its\ncorrect interpretation on a balanced nautical judgement. Finally, I\nhad been unconsciously realizing, and knew from his mouth to-day,\nthat he had exercised and acted on that judgement in the teeth of\npersonal considerations, which his loyal nature made overwhelming in\ntheir force.\n\nWhat, then, was the meaning of Memmert? At the outset it riveted my\nattention on the Ems estuary, whose mouth it adjoins. We had always\nrather neglected the Ems in our calculations; with some excuse, too,\nfor at first sight its importance bears no proportion to that of the\nthree greater estuaries. The latter bear vessels of the largest\ntonnage and deepest draught to the very quays of Hamburg,\nBremerhaven, and the naval dockyard of Wilhelmshaven; while two of\nthem, the Elbe and the Weser, are commerce carriers on the vastest\nscale for the whole empire. The Ems, on the other hand, only serves\ntowns of the second class. A glance at the chart explains this. You\nsee a most imposing estuary on a grander scale than any of the other\nthree taken singly, with a length of thirty miles and a frontage on\nthe North Sea of ten miles, or one-seventieth, roughly, of the whole\nseaboard; encumbered by outlying shoals, and blocked in the centre by\nthe island of Borkum, but presenting two fine deep-water channels to\nthe incoming vessel. These roll superbly through enormous sheets of\nsand, unite and approach the mainland in one stately stream three\nmiles in breadth. But then comes a sad falling off. The navigable\nfairway shoals and shrinks, middle grounds obstruct it, and shelving\nforeshores persistently deny it that easy access to the land that\nalone can create great seaboard cities. All the ports of the Ems are\ntidal; the harbour of Delfzyl, on the Dutch side, dries at low water,\nand Emden, the principal German port, can only be reached by a lock\nand a mile of canal.\n\nBut this depreciation is only relative. Judged on its merits, and not\nby the standard of the Elbe, it is a very important river. Emden is a\nflourishing and growing port. For shallow craft the stream is\nnavigable far into the interior, where, aided by tributaries and\nallied canals (notably the connection with the Rhine at Dortmund,\nthen approaching completion), it taps the resources of a great area.\nStrategically there was still less reason for underrating it. It is\none of the great maritime gates of Germany; and it is the westernmost\ngate, the nearest to Great Britain and France, contiguous to Holland.\nIts great forked delta presents two yawning breaches in that singular\nrampart of islets and shoals which masks the German seaboard--a\nseaboard itself so short in proportion to the empire's bulk, that, as\nDavies used to say, 'every inch of it must be important'. Warships\ncould force these breaches, and so threaten the mainland at one of\nits few vulnerable points. Quay accommodation is no object to such\nvisitors; intricate navigation no deterrent. Even the heaviest\nbattleships could approach within striking distance of the land,\nwhile cruisers and military transports could penetrate to the level\nof Emden itself. Emden, as Davies had often pointed out, is connected\nby canal with Wilhelmshaven on the Jade, a strategic canal, designed\nto carry gunboats as well as merchandise.\n\nNow Memmert was part of the outer rampart; its tapering sickle of sand\ndirectly commanded the eastern breach; it _must_ be connected with the\ndefence of this breach. No more admirable base could be imagined;\nself-contained and isolated, yet sheltered, accessible--better than\nJuist and Borkum. And supposing it were desired to shroud the nature of\nthe work in absolute secrecy, what a pretext lay to hand in the wreck\nand its buried bullion, which lay in the offing opposite the fairway!\n\nOn Memmert was the dep\u00c3\u00b4t for the salvage operations. Salvage work,\nwith its dredging and diving, offered precisely the disguise that was\nneeded. It was submarine, and so are some of the most important\ndefences of ports, mines, and dirigible torpedoes. All the details of\nthe story were suggestive: the 'small local company'; the 'engineer\nfrom Bremen' (who, I wondered, was he?); the few shares held by von\nBr\u00c3\u00bcning, enough to explain his visits; the stores and gear coming\nfrom Wilhelmshaven, a naval dockyard.\n\nTry as I would I could not stir Davies's imagination as mine was\nstirred. He was bent on only seeing the objections, which, of course,\nwere numerous enough. Could secrecy be ensured under pretext of\nsalving a wreck? It must be a secret shared by many--divers, crews of\ntugs, employees of all sorts. I answered that trade secrets are often\npreserved under no less difficult conditions, and why not imperial\nsecrets?\n\n'Why the Ems and not the Elbe?' he asked.\n\n'Perhaps,' I replied, 'the Elbe, too, holds similar mysteries.'\nNeuerk Island might, for all we knew, be another Memmert; when\ncruising in that region we had had no eyes for such things, absorbed\nin a preconceived theory of our own. Besides, we must not take\nourselves too seriously. We were amateurs, not experts in coast\ndefence, and on such vague grounds to fastidiously reject a clue\nwhich went so far as this one was to quarrel with our luck. There was\na disheartening corollary to this latter argument that in my new-born\nzeal I shut my eyes to. As amateurs, were we capable of using our\nclue and gaining exact knowledge of the defences in question? Davies,\nI knew, felt this strongly, and I think it accounted for his lukewarm\nview of Memmert more than he was aware. He clung more obstinately\nthan ever to his 'channel theory', conscious that it offered the one\nsort of opportunity of which with his peculiar gifts he was able to\ntake advantage. He admitted, however, that it was under a cloud at\npresent, for if knowledge of the coastwise navigation were a crime in\nitself we should scarcely be sitting here now. 'It's something to do\nwith it, anyhow!' he persisted.\n\n\n\n\nXVIII. Imperial Escort\n\n\nMEMMERT gripped me, then, to the exclusion of a rival notion which\nhad given me no little perplexity during the conversation with von\nBr\u00c3\u00bcning. His reiterated advice that we should lose no time in picking\nup our anchor and chain had ended by giving me the idea that he was\nanxious to get us away from Bensersiel and the mainland. At first I\nhad taken the advice partly as a test of our veracity (as I gave the\nreader to understand), and partly as an indirect method of lulling\nany suspicions which Grimm's midnight visit may have caused. Then it\nstruck me that this might be over-subtlety on my part, and the idea\nrecurred when the question of our future plans cropped up, and\nhampered me in deciding on a course. It returned again when von\nBr\u00c3\u00bcning offered to tow us out in the evening. It was in my mind when\nI questioned him as to his business ashore, for it occurred to me\nthat perhaps his landing here was not solely due to a wish to inspect\nthe crew of the _Dulcibella_. Then came his perfectly frank explanation\n(with its sinister _double entente_ for us), coupled with an\ninvitation to me to accompany him to Esens. But, on the principle of\n_timeo Danaos_ etc., I instantly smelt a ruse, not that I dreamt\nthat I was to be decoyed into captivity; but if there was anything\nhere which we two might discover in the few hours left to us, it was\nan ingenious plan to remove the most observant of the two till the\nhour of departure.\n\nDavies scorned them, and I had felt only a faint curiosity in these\ninsignificant hamlets, influenced, I am afraid, chiefly by a\nhankering after _terra firma_ which the pitiless rigour of his\ntraining had been unable to cure.\n\nBut it was imprudent to neglect the slightest chance. It was three\no'clock, and I think both our brains were beginning to be addled with\nthinking in close confinement. I suggested that we should finish our\ncouncil of war in the open, and we both donned oilskins and turned\nout. The sky had hardened and banked into an even canopy of lead, and\nthe wind drove before it a fine cold rain. You could hear the murmur\nof the rising flood on the sands outside, but the harbour was high\nabove it still, and the _Dulcibella_ and the other boats squatted low\nin a bed of black slime. Native interest seemed to be at last\nassuaged, for not a soul was visible on the bank (I cannot call it a\nquay); but the top of a black sou'wester with a feather of smoke\ncurling round it showed above the forehatch of the 'Kormoran'.\n\n'I wish I could get a look at your cargo, my friend,' I thought to\nmyself.\n\nWe gazed at Bensersiel in silence.\n\n'There can't be anything _here_?' I said.\n\n'What _can_ there be?' said Davies.\n\n'What about that dyke?' I said, with a sudden inspiration.\n\nFrom the bank we could see all along the coast-line, which is dyked\ncontinuously, as I have already said. The dyke was here a substantial\nbrick-faced embankment, very similar, though on a smaller scale, to\nthat which had bordered the Elbe near Cuxhaven, and over whose summit\nwe had seen the snouts of guns.\n\n'I say, Davies,' I said, 'do you think this coast could be invaded?\nAlong here, I mean, behind these islands?'\n\nDavies shook his head. 'I've thought of that,' he said. 'There's\nnothing in it. It's just the very last place on earth where a landing\nwould be possible. No transport could get nearer than where the _Blitz_\nis lying, four miles out.'\n\n'Well, you say every inch of this coast is important?'\n\n'Yes, but it's the _water_ I mean.'\n\n'Well, I want to see that dyke. Let's walk along it.'\n\nMy mushroom theory died directly I set foot on it. It was the most\ninnocent structure in the world--like a thousand others in Essex and\nHolland--topped by a narrow path, where we walked in single file with\narms akimbo to keep our balance in the gusts of wind. Below us lay\nthe sands on one side and rank fens on the other, interspersed with\nsquares of pasture ringed in with ditches. After half a mile we\ndropped down and came back by a short circuit inland, following a\nmazy path--which was mostly right angles and minute plank bridges,\ntill we came to the Esens road. We crossed this and soon after found\nour way barred by the stream I spoke of. This involved a _d\u00c3\u00a9tour_ to\nthe bridge in the village, and a stealthy avoidance of the\npost-office, for dread of its garrulous occupant. Then we followed\nthe dyke in the other direction, and ended by a circuit over the\nsands, which were fast being covered by the tide, and so back to the\nyacht.\n\nNobody appeared to have taken the slightest notice of our movements.\n\nAs we walked we had tackled the last question, 'What are we to do?'\nand found very little to say on it. We were to leave to-night (unless\nthe Esens police appeared on the scene), and were committed to\nsailing direct to Norderney, as the only alternative to duck shooting\nunder the espionage of a 'trustworthy' nominee of von Br\u00c3\u00bcning's.\nBeyond that--vagueness and difficulty of every sort.\n\nAt Norderney I should be fettered by my letter. If it seemed to have\nbeen opened and it ordered my return, I was limited to a week, or\nmust risk suspicion by staying. Dollmann was away (according to von\nBr\u00c3\u00bcning), 'would probably be back soon'; but how soon? Beyond\nNorderney lay Memmert. How to probe its secret? The ardour it had\nroused in me was giving way to a mortifying sense of impotence. The\nsight of the 'Kormoran', with her crew preparing for sea, was a pointed\ncomment on my diplomacy, and most of all on my ridiculous survey of\nthe dykes. When all was said and done we were _prot\u00c3\u00a9g\u00c3\u00a9s_ of von\nBr\u00c3\u00bcning, and dogged by Grimm. Was it likely they would let us\nsucceed?\n\nThe tide was swirling into the harbour in whorls of chocolate froth,\nand as it rose all Bensersiel, dominated as before by Herr Schenkel,\nstraggled down to the quay to watch the movements of shipping during\nthe transient but momentous hour when the mud-hole was a seaport. The\ncaptain's steam-cutter was already afloat, and her sailors busy with\nsidelights and engines. When it became known that we, too, were to\nsail, and under such distinguished escort, the excitement\nintensified.\n\nAgain our friend of the Customs was spreading out papers to sign,\nwhile a throng of helpful Frisians, headed by the twin giants of the\npost-boat, thronged our decks and made us ready for sea in their own\nconfused fashion. Again we were carried up to the inn and overwhelmed\nwith advice, and warnings, and farewell toasts. Then back again to\nfind the _Dulcibella_ afloat, and von Br\u00c3\u00bcning just arrived, cursing the\nweather and the mud, chaffing Davies, genial and _d\u00c3\u00a9bonnaire_ as\never.\n\n'Stow that mainsail, you won't want it,' he said. 'I'll tow you right\nout to Spiekeroog. It's your only anchorage for the night in this\nwind--under the island, near the _Blitz_, and that would mean a dead\nbeat for you in the dark.'\n\nThe fact was so true, and the offer so timely, that Davies's faint\nprotests were swept aside in a torrent of ridicule.\n\n'And now I think of it,' the Commander ended, 'I'll make the trip\nwith you, if I may. It'll be pleasanter and drier.'\n\nWe all three boarded the _Dulcibella_, and then the end came. Our\ntow-rope was attached, and at half-past six the little launch jumped\ninto the collar, and amidst a demonstration that could not have been\nmore hearty if we had been ambassadors on a visit to a friendly\npower, we sidled out through the jetties.\n\nIt took us more than an hour to cover the five miles to Spiekeroog,\nfor the _Dulcibella_ was a heavy load in the stiff head wind, and\nDavies, though he said nothing, showed undisguised distrust of our\ntug's capacities. He at once left the helm to me and flung himself on\nthe gear, not resting till every rope was ready to hand, the mainsail\nreefed, the binnacle lighted, and all ready for setting sail or\nanchoring at a moment's notice. Our guest watched these precautions\nwith infinite amusement. He was in the highest and most mischievous\nhumour, raining banter on Davies and mock sympathy on me, laughing at\nour huge compass, heaving the lead himself, startling us with\nimaginary soundings, and doubting if his men were sober. I offered\nentertainment and warmth below, but he declined on the ground that\nDavies would be tempted to cut the tow-rope and make us pass the\nnight on a safe sandbank. Davies took the raillery unmoved. His work\ndone, he took the tiller and sat bareheaded, intent on the launch,\nthe course, the details, and chances of the present. I brought up\ncigars and we settled ourselves facing him, our backs to the wind and\nspray. And so we made the rest of the passage, von Br\u00c3\u00bcning cuddled\nagainst me and the cabin-hatch, alternately shouting a jest to Davies\nand talking to me in a light and charming vein, with just that shade\nof patronage that the disparity in our ages warranted, about my time\nin Germany, places, people, and books I knew, and about life,\nespecially young men's life, in England, a country he had never\nvisited, but hoped to; I responding as well as I could, striving to\nmeet his mood, acquit myself like a man, draw zest instead of\nhumiliation from the irony of our position, but scarcely able to make\nheadway against a numbing sense of defeat and incapacity. A queer\nthought was haunting me, too, that such skill and judgement as I\npossessed was slipping from me as we left the land and faced again\nthe rigours of this exacting sea. Davies, I very well knew, was under\nexactly the opposite spell--a spell which even the reproach of the\ntow-rope could not annul. His face, in the glow of the binnacle, was\nbeginning to wear that same look of contentment and resolve that I\nhad seen on it that night we had sailed to Kiel from Schlei Fiord.\nHeaven knows he had more cause for worry than I--a casual comrade in\nan adventure which was peculiarly his, which meant everything on\nearth to him; but there he was, washing away perplexity in the salt\nwind, drawing counsel and confidence from the unfailing source of all\nhis inspirations--the sea.\n\n'Looks happy, doesn't he?' said the captain once. I grunted that he\ndid, ashamed to find how irritated the remark made me.\n\n'You'll remember what I said,' he added in my ear.\n\n'Yes,' I said. 'But I should like to see her. What _is_ she like?'\n\n'Dangerous.' I could well believe it.\n\nThe hull of the _Blitz_ loomed up, and a minute later our kedge was\nsplashing overboard and the launch was backing alongside.\n\n'Good-night, gentlemen,' said our passenger. 'You're safe enough\nhere, and you can run across in ten minutes in the morning and pick\nup your anchor, if it's there still. Then you've a fair wind west--to\nEngland if you like. If you decide to stay a little longer in these\nparts, and I'm in reach, count on me to help you, to sport or\nanything else.'\n\nWe thanked him, shook hands, and he was gone.\n\n'He's a thundering good chap, anyhow,' said Davies; and I heartily\nagreed.\n\nThe narrow vigilant life began again at once. We were 'safe enough'\nin a sense, but a warp and a twenty-pound anchor were poor security\nif the wind backed or increased. Plans for contingencies had to be\nmade, and deck-watches kept till midnight, when the weather seemed to\nimprove, and stars appeared. The glass was rising, so we turned in\nand slept under the very wing, so to speak, of the Imperial\nGovernment.\n\n'Davies,' I said, when we were settled in our bunks, 'it's only a\nday's sail to Norderney, isn't it?'\n\n'With a fair wind, less, if we go outside the islands direct.'\n\n'Well, it's settled that we do that to-morrow?'\n\n'I suppose so. We've got to get the anchor first. Good-night.'\n\n\n\n\nXIX. The Rubicon\n\n\nIT was a cold, vaporous dawn, the glass rising, and the wind fallen\nto a light air still from the north-east. Our creased and sodden\nsails scarcely answered to it as we crept across the oily swell to\nLangeoog. 'Fogs and calms,' Davies prophesied. The _Blitz_ was astir\nwhen we passed her, and soon after steamed out to sea. Once over the\nbar, she turned westward and was lost to view in the haze. I should\nbe sorry to have to explain how we found that tiny anchor-buoy, on\nthe expressionless waste of grey. I only know that I hove the lead\nincessantly while Davies conned, till at last he was grabbing\noverside with the boathook, and there was the buoy on deck. The\ncable was soon following it, and finally the rusty monster himself,\nmore loathsome than usual, after his long sojourn in the slime.\n\n'That's all right,' said Davies. 'Now we can go anywhere.'\n\n'Well, it's Norderney, isn't it? We've settled that.'\n\n'Yes, I suppose we have. I was wondering whether it wouldn't be\nshortest to go inside Langeoog after all.'\n\n'Surely not,' I urged. 'The tide's ebbing now, and the light's bad;\nit's new ground, with a \"watershed\" to cross, and we're safe to get\naground.'\n\n'All right--outside. Ready about.' We swung lazily round and headed\nfor the open sea. I record the fact, but in truth Davies might have\ntaken me where he liked, for no land was visible, only a couple of\nghostly booms.\n\n'It seems a pity to miss over that channel,' said Davies with a sigh;\n'just when the 'Kormoran' can't watch us.' (We had not seen her at all\nthis morning.)\n\nI set myself to the lead again, averse to reopening a barren\nargument. Grimm had done his work for the present, I felt certain,\nand was on his way by the shortest road to Norderney and Memmert.\n\nWe were soon outside and heading west, our boom squared away and the\nisland sand-dunes just apparent under our lee. Then the breeze died\nto the merest draught, and left us rolling inert in a long swell.\nConsumed with impatience to get on I saw fatality in this failure of\nwind, after a fortnight of unprofitable meanderings, when we had\ngenerally had too much of it, and always enough for our purpose. I\ntried to read below, but the vile squirting of the centreboard drove\nme up.\n\n'Can't we go any faster?' I burst out once. I felt that there ought\nto be a pyramid of gauzy canvas aloft, spinnakers, flying jibs and\nwhat not.\n\n'I don't go in for speed,' said Davies, shortly. He loyally did his\nbest to 'shove her' along, but puffs and calms were the rule all day,\nand it was only by towing in the dinghy for two hours in the\nafternoon that we covered the length of Langeoog, and crept before\ndark to an anchorage behind Baltrum, its slug-shaped neighbour on the\nwest. Strictly, I believe, we should have kept the sea all night; but\nI had not the grit to suggest that course, and Davies was only too\nglad of an excuse for threading the shoals of the Accumer Ee on a\nrising tide. The atmosphere had been slowly clearing as the day wore\non; but we had scarcely anchored ten minutes before a blanket of\nwhite fog, rolling in from seaward, swallowed us up. Davies was\nalready afield in the dinghy, and I had to guide him back with a\nfoghorn, whose music roused hosts of sea birds from the surrounding\nflats, and brought them wheeling and complaining round us, a weird\ninvisible chorus to my mournful solo.\n\nThe fog hung heavy still at daybreak on the 20th, but dispersed\npartially under a catspaw from the south about eight o'clock, in time\nfor us to traverse the boomed channel behind Baltrum, before the tide\nleft the watershed.\n\n'We shan't get far to-day,' said Davies, with philosophy. 'And this\nsort of thing may go on for any time. It's a regular autumn\nanti-cyclone--glass thirty point five and steady. That gale was the\nlast of a stormy equinox.'\n\nWe took the inside route as a matter of course to-day. It was now the\nshortest to Norderney harbour, and scarcely less intricate than the\nWichter Ee, which appeared to be almost totally blocked by banks, and\nis, in fact, the most impassable of all these outlets to the North\nSea. But, as I say, this sort of navigation, always puzzling to me,\nwas utterly bewildering in hazy weather. Any attempt at orientation\nmade me giddy. So I slaved at the lead, varying my labour with a\nfierce bout of kedge-work when we grounded somewhere. I had two rests\nbefore two o'clock, one of an hour, when we ran into a patch of\nwindless fog; another of a few moments, when Davies said, 'There's\nNorderney!' and I saw, surmounting a long slope of weedy sand, still\nwet with the receding sea, a cluster of sandhills exactly like a\nhundred others I had seen of late, but fraught with a new and unique\ninterest.\n\nThe usual formula, 'What have you got now?' checked my reverie, and\n'Helm's a-lee,' ended it for the time. We tacked on (for the wind had\nheaded us) in very shoal water.\n\nSuddenly Davies said: 'Is that a boat ahead?'\n\n'Do you mean that galliot?' I asked. I could plainly distinguish one\nof those familiar craft about half a mile away, just within the limit\nof vision.\n\n'The 'Kormoran', do you think?' I added. Davies said nothing, but grew\ninattentive to his work. 'Barely four,' from me passed unnoticed, and\nwe touched once, but swung off under some play of the current. Then\ncame abruptly, 'Stand by the anchor. Let go,' and we brought up in\nmid-stream of the narrow creek we were following. I triced up the\nmain-tack, and stowed the headsails unaided. When I had done Davies\nwas still gazing to windward through his binoculars, and, to my\nastonishment, I noticed that his hands were trembling violently. I\nhad never seen this happen before, even at moments when a false turn\nof the wrist meant death on a surf-battered bank.\n\n'What is it?' I asked; 'are you cold?'\n\n'That little boat,' he said. I gazed to windward, too, and now saw a\nscrap of white in the distance, in sharp relief.\n\n'Small standing lug and jib; it's her, right enough,' said Davies to\nhimself, in a sort of nervous stammer.\n\n'Who? What?'\n\n''Medusa's' dinghy.'\n\nHe handed, or rather pushed, me the glasses, still gazing.\n\n'Dollmann?' I exclaimed.\n\n'No, it's _hers_--the one she always sails. She's come to meet m--,\nus.'\n\nThrough the glasses the white scrap became a graceful little sail,\nsquared away for the light following breeze. An angle of the creek\nhid the hull, then it glided into view. Someone was sitting aft\nsteering, man or woman I could not say, for the sail hid most of the\nfigure. For full two minutes--two long, pregnant minutes--we watched\nit in silence. The damp air was fogging the lenses, but I kept them\nto my eyes; for I did not want to look at Davies. At last I heard him\ndraw a deep breath, straighten himself up, and give one of his\ncharacteristic 'h'ms'. Then he turned briskly aft, cast off the\ndinghy's painter, and pulled her up alongside.\n\n'You come too,' he said, jumping in, and fixing the rowlocks. (His\nhands were steady again.) I laughed, and shoved the dinghy off.\n\n'I'd rather you did,' he said, defiantly.\n\n'I'd rather stay. I'll tidy up, and put the kettle on.' Davies had\ntaken a half stroke, but paused.\n\n'She oughtn't to come aboard.' he said.\n\n'She might like to,' I suggested. 'Chilly day, long way from home,\ncommon courtesy----'\n\n'Carruthers,' said Davies, 'if she comes aboard, please remember that\nshe's outside this business. There are no clues to be got from\n_her_.'\n\nA little lecture which would have nettled me more if I had not been\nexultantly telling myself that, once and for all, for good or ill,\nthe Rubicon was passed.\n\n'It's your affair this time,' I said; 'run it as you please.'\n\nHe sculled away with vigorous strokes. 'Just as he is,' I thought to\nmyself: bare head, beaded with fog-dew, ancient oilskin coat (only\none button); grey jersey; grey woollen trousers (like a deep-sea\nfisherman's) stuffed into long boots. A vision of his antitype, the\nCowes Philanderer, crossed me for a second. As to his face--well, I\ncould only judge by it, and marvel, that he was gripping his dilemma\nby either horn, as firmly as he gripped his sculls.\n\nI watched the two boats converging. They would meet in the natural\ncourse about three hundred yards away, but a hitch occurred. First,\nthe sail-boat checked and slewed; 'aground,' I concluded. The\nrowboat leapt forward still; then checked, too. From both a great\nsplashing of sculls floated across the still air, then silence. The\nsummit of the watershed, a physical Rubicon, prosaic and slimy, had\nstill to be crossed, it seemed. But it could be evaded. Both boats\nheaded for the northern side of the creek: two figures were out on\nthe brink, hauling on two painters. Then Davies was striding over the\nsand, and a girl--I could see her now--was coming to meet him. And\nthen I thought it was time to go below and tidy up.\n\nNothing on earth could have made the _Dulcibella_s' saloon a worthy\nreception-room for a lady. I could only use hurried efforts to make\nit look its best by plying a bunch of cotton-waste and a floor-brush;\nby pitching into racks and lockers the litter of pipes, charts,\noddments of apparel, and so on, that had a way of collecting afresh,\nhowever recently we had tidied up; by neatly arranging our\ndemoralized library, and by lighting the stove and veiling the table\nunder a clean white cloth.\n\nI suppose about twenty minutes had elapsed, and I was scrubbing\nfruitlessly at the smoky patch on the ceiling, when I heard the sound\nof oars and voices outside. I threw the cotton-waste into the\nfo'c'sle, made an onslaught on my hands, and then mounted the\ncompanion ladder. Our own dinghy was just rounding up alongside,\nDavies sculling in the bows, facing him in the stern a young girl in\na grey tam-o'-shanter, loose waterproof jacket and dark serge skirt,\nthe latter, to be frigidly accurate, disclosing a pair of\nworkman-like rubber boots which, _mutatis mutandis,_ were very like\nthose Davies was wearing. Her hair, like his, was spangled with\nmoisture, and her rose-brown skin struck a note of delicious colour\nagainst the sullen Stygian background.\n\n'There he is,' said Davies. Never did his 'meiner Freund,\nCarruthers,' sound so pleasantly in my ears; never so discordantly\nthe 'Fr\u00c3\u00a4ulein Dollmann' that followed it. Every syllable of the four\nwas a lie. Two honest English eyes were looking up into mine; an\nhonest English hand--is this insular nonsense? Perhaps so, but I\nstick to it--a brown, firm hand--no, not so very small, my\nsentimental reader--was clasping mine. Of course I had strong\nreasons, apart from the racial instinct, for thinking her to be\nEnglish, but I believe that if I had had none at all I should at any\nrate have congratulated Germany on a clever bit of plagiarism. By her\nvoice, when she spoke, I knew that she must have talked German\nhabitually from childhood; diction and accent were faultless, at\nleast to my English ear; but the native constitutional ring was\nwanting.\n\nShe came on board. There was a hollow discussion first about time and\nweather, but it ended as we all in our hearts wished it to end. None\nof us uttered our real scruples. Mine, indeed, were too new and\nrudimentary to be worth uttering, so I said common-sense things about\ntea and warmth; but I began to think about my compact with Davies.\n\n'Just for a few minutes, then,' she said.\n\nI held out my hand and swung her up. She gazed round the deck and\nrigging with profound interest--a breathless, hungry interest--touching\nto see.\n\n'You've seen her before, haven't you?' I said.\n\n'I've not been on board before,' she answered.\n\nThis struck me in passing as odd; but then I had only too few details\nfrom Davies about his days at Norderney in September.\n\n'Of course, _that_ is what puzzled me,' she exclaimed, suddenly,\npointing to the mizzen. 'I knew there was something different.'\n\nDavies had belayed the painter, and now had to explain the origin of\nthe mizzen. This was a cumbrous process, and his hearer's attention\nsoon wandered from the subject and became centred in him--his was\nalready more than half in her--and the result was a golden\nopportunity for the discerning onlooker. It was very brief, but I\nmade the most of it; buried deep a few regrets, did a little\nheartfelt penance, told myself I had been a cynical fool not to have\nforeseen this, and faced the new situation with a sinking heart; I am\nnot ashamed to admit that, for I was fond of Davies, and I was keen\nabout the quest.\n\nShe had never been a guilty agent in that attempt on Davies. Had she\nbeen an unconscious tool or only an unwilling one? If the latter, did\nshe know the secret we were seeking? In the last degree unlikely, I\ndecided. But, true to the compact, whose importance I now fully\nappreciated, I flung aside my diplomatic weapons, recoiling, as\nstrongly, or nearly as strongly, let us say, from any effort direct\nor indirect to gain information from such a source. It was not our\nfault if by her own conversation and behaviour she gave us some idea\nof how matters stood. Davies already knew more than I did.\n\nWe spent a few minutes on deck while she asked eager questions about\nour build and gear and seaworthiness, with a quaint mixture of\nprofessional acumen and personal curiosity.\n\n'How _did_ you manage alone that day?' she asked Davies, suddenly.\n\n'Oh, it was quite safe,' was the reply. 'But it's much better to have\na friend.'\n\nShe looked at me; and--well, I would have died for Davies there and\nthen.\n\n'Father said you would be safe,' she remarked, with decision--a\nslight excess of decision, I thought. And at that turned to some rope\nor block and pursued her questioning. She found the compass\nimpressive, and the trappings of that hateful centreboard had a\npeculiar fascination for her. Was this the way we did it in England?\nwas her constant query.\n\nYet, in spite of a superficial freedom, we were all shy and\nconstrained. The descent below was a welcome diversion, for we should\nhave been less than human if we had not extracted some spontaneous\nfun from the humours of the saloon. I went down first to see about\nthe tea, leaving them struggling for mutual comprehension over the\ntheory of an English lifeboat. They soon followed, and I can see her\nnow stooping in at the doorway, treading delicately, like a kitten,\npast the obstructive centreboard to a place on the starboard sofa,\nthen taking in her surroundings with a timid rapture that broke into\ndelight at all the primitive arrangements and dingy amenities of our\nden. She explored the cavernous recesses of the Rippingille, fingered\nthe duck-guns and the miscellany in the racks, and peeped into the\nfo'c'sle with dainty awe. Everything was a source of merriment, from\nour cramped attitudes to the painful deficiency of spoons and the\n'yachtiness' (there is no other word to describe it) of the bread,\nwhich had been bought at Bensersiel, and had suffered from\nincarceration and the climate. This fact came out, and led to some\nquestions, while we waited for the water to boil, about the gale and\nour visit there. The topic, a pregnant one for us, appeared to have\nno special significance to her. At the mention of von Br\u00c3\u00bcning she\nshowed no emotion of any sort; on the contrary, she went out of her\nway, from an innocent motive that anyone could have guessed, to show\nthat she could talk about him with dispassionate detachment.\n\n'He came to see us when you were here last, didn't he?' she said to\nDavies. 'He often comes. He goes with father to Memmert sometimes.\nYou know about Memmert? They are diving for money out of an old\nwreck.'\n\n'Yes, we had heard about it.'\n\n'Of course you have. Father is a director of the company, and\nCommander von Br\u00c3\u00bcning takes great interest in it; they took me down\nin a diving-bell once.'\n\nI murmured, 'Indeed!' and Davies sawed laboriously at the bread. She\nmust have misconstrued our sheepish silence, for she stopped and drew\nherself up with just a touch of momentary _hauteur_, utterly lost on\nDavies. I could have laughed aloud at this transient little comedy of\nerrors.\n\n'Did you see any gold?' said Davies at last, with husky solemnity.\nSomething had to be said or we should defeat our own end; but I let\nhim say it. He had not my faith in Memmert.\n\n'No, only mud and timber--oh, I forgot----'\n\n'You mustn't betray the company's secrets,' I said, laughing;\n'Commander von Br\u00c3\u00bcning wouldn't tell us a word about the gold.'\n('There's self-denial!' I said to myself.)\n\n'Oh, I don't think it matters much,' she answered, laughing too. 'You\nare only visitors.'\n\n'That's all,' I remarked, demurely. 'Just passing travellers.'\n\n'You will stop at Norderney?' she said, with na\u00c3\u00afve anxiety. 'Herr\nDavies said----'\n\nI looked to Davies; it was his affair. Fair and square came his\nanswer, in blunt dog-German.\n\n'Yes, of course, we shall. I should like to see your father again.'\n\nUp to this moment I had been doubtful of his final decision; for ever\nsince our explanation at Bensersiel I had had the feeling that I was\nholding his nose to a very cruel grindstone. This straight word,\nclear and direct, beyond anything I had hoped for, brought me to my\nsenses and showed me that his mind had been working far in advance of\nmine; and more, shaping a double purpose that I had never dreamt of.\n\n'My father?' said Fr\u00c3\u00a4ulein Dollmann; 'yes, I am sure he will be very\nglad to see you.\n\nThere was no conviction in her tone, and her eyes were distant and\ntroubled.\n\n'He's not at home now, is he?' I asked.\n\n'How did you know?' (a little maidenly confusion). 'Oh, Commander von\nBr\u00c3\u00bcning.'\n\nI might have added that it had been clear as daylight all along that\nthis visit was in the nature of an escapade of which her father might\nnot approve. I tried to say 'I won't tell,' without words, and may\nhave succeeded.\n\n'I told Mr Davies when we first met,' she went on. 'I expect him back\nvery soon--to-morrow in fact; he wrote from Amsterdam. He left me at\nHamburg and has been away since. Of course, he will not know your\nyacht is back again. I think he expected Mr Davies would stay in the\nBaltic, as the season was so late. But--but I am sure he will be glad\nto see you.'\n\n'Is the 'Medusa' in harbour?' said Davies.\n\n'Yes; but we are not living on her now. We are at our villa in the\nSchwannall\u00c3\u00a9e--my stepmother and I, that is.' She added some details,\nand Davies gravely pencilled down the address on a leaf of the\nlog-book; a formality which somehow seemed to regularize the present\nposition.\n\n'We shall be at Norderney to-morrow,' he said.\n\nMeanwhile the kettle was boiling merrily, and I made the tea--cocoa,\nI should say, for the menu was changed in deference to our visitor's\ntastes. 'This _is_ fun!' she said. And by common consent we abandoned\nourselves, three youthful, hungry mariners, to the enjoyment of this\nimpromptu picnic. Such a chance might never occur again--_carpamus\ndiem._\n\nBut the banquet was never celebrated. As at Belshazzar's feast, there\nwas a writing on the wall; no supernatural inscription, but just a\nprinted name; an English surname with title and initials, in cheap\ngilt lettering on the back of an old book; a silent, sneering witness\nof our snug party. The catastrophe came and passed so suddenly that\nat the time I had scarcely even an inkling of what caused it; but I\nknow now that this is how it happened. Our visitor was sitting at the\nforward end of the starboard sofa, close to the bulkhead. Davies and\nI were opposite her. Across the bulkhead, on a level with our heads,\nran the bookshelf, whose contents, remember, I had carefully\nstraightened only half an hour ago, little dreaming of the\nconsequence. Some trifle, probably the logbook which Davies had\nreached down from the shelf, called her attention to the rest of our\nlibrary. While busied with the cocoa I heard her spelling out some\ntitles, fingering leaves, and twitting Davies with the little care he\ntook of his books. Suddenly there was a silence which made me look\nup, to see a startled and pitiful change in her. She was staring at\nDavies with wide eyes and parted lips, a burning flush mounting on\nher forehead, and such an expression on her face as a sleep-walker\nmight wear, who wakes in fear he knows not where.\n\nHalf her mind was far away, labouring to construe some hideous dream\nof the past; half was in the present, cringing before some sickening\nreality. She remained so for perhaps ten seconds, and then--plucky\ngirl that she was--she mastered herself, looked deliberately round\nand up with a circular glance, strangely in the manner of Davies\nhimself, and spoke. How late it was, she must be going--her boat was\nnot safe. At the same time she rose to go, or rather slid herself\nalong the sofa, for rising was impossible. We sat like mannerless\nlouts, in blank amazement. Davies at the outset had said, 'What's the\nmatter?' in plain English, and then relapsed into stupefaction. I\nrecovered myself the first, and protested in some awkward fashion\nabout the cocoa, the time, the absence of fog. In trying to answer,\nher self-possession broke down, poor child, and her retreat became a\nblind flight, like that of a wounded animal, while every sordid\ncircumstance seemed to accentuate her panic.\n\nShe tilted the corner of the table in leaving the sofa and spilt\ncocoa over her skirt; she knocked her head with painful force against\nthe sharp lintel of the doorway, and stumbled on the steps of the\nladder. I was close behind, but when I reached the deck she was\nalready on the counter hauling up the dinghy. She had even jumped in\nand laid hands on the sculls before any check came in her precipitate\nmovements. Now there occurred to her the patent fact that the dinghy\nwas ours, and that someone must accompany her to bring it back.\n\n'Davies will row you over,' I said.\n\n'Oh no, thank you,' she stammered. 'If you will be so kind, Herr\nCarruthers. It is your turn. No, I mean, I want----'\n\n'Go on,' said Davies to me in English.\n\nI stepped into the dinghy and motioned to take the sculls from her.\nShe seemed not to see me, and pushed off while Davies handed down her\njacket, which she had left in the cabin. Neither of us tried to\nbetter the situation by conventional apologies. It was left to her,\nat the last moment, to make a show of excusing herself, an attempt so\nbrave and yet so wretchedly lame that I tingled all over with hot\nshame. She only made matters worse, and Davies interrupted her.\n\n'_Auf Wiedersehen_,' he said, simply.\n\nShe shook her head, did not even offer her hand, and pulled away;\nDavies turned sharp round and went below.\n\nThere was now no muddy Rubicon to obstruct us, for the tide had risen\na good deal, and the sands were covering. I offered again to take the\nsculls, but she took no notice and rowed on, so that I was a silent\npassenger on the stem seat till we reached her boat, a spruce little\nyacht's gig, built to the native model, with a spoon-bow and tiny\nlee-boards. It was already afloat, but riding quite safely to a rope\nand a little grapnel, which she proceeded to haul in.\n\n'It was quite safe after all, you see,' I said.\n\n'Yes, but I could not stay. Herr Carruthers, I want to say something\nto you.' (I knew it was coming; von Br\u00c3\u00bcning's warning over again.) 'I\nmade a mistake just now; it is no use your calling on us to-morrow.'\n\n'Why not?'\n\n'You will not see my father.'\n\n'I thought you said he was coming back?'\n\n'Yes, by the morning steamer; but he will be very busy.'\n\n'We can wait. We have several days to spare, and we have to call for\nletters anyhow.'\n\n'You must not delay on our account. The weather is very fine at last.\nIt would be a pity to lose a chance of a smooth voyage to England.\nThe season----'\n\n'We have no fixed plans. Davies wants to get some shooting.\n\n'My father will be much occupied.'\n\n'We can see _you_.'\n\nI insisted on being obtuse, for though this fencing with an unstrung\ngirl was hateful work, the quest was at stake. We were going to\nNorderney, come what might, and sooner or later we must see Dollmann.\nIt was no use promising not to. I had given no pledge to von Br\u00c3\u00bcning,\nand I would give none to her. The only alternative was to violate the\ncompact (which the present fiasco had surely weakened), speak out,\nand try and make an ally of her. Against her own father? I shrank\nfrom the responsibility and counted the cost of failure--certain\nfailure, to judge by her conduct. She began to hoist her lugsail in a\ndazed, shiftless fashion, while our two boats drifted slowly to\nleeward.\n\n'Father might not like it,' she said, so low and from such tremulous\nlips that I scarcely caught her words. 'He does not like foreigners\nmuch. I am afraid ... he did not want to see Herr Davies again.'\n\n'But I thought----'\n\n'It was wrong of me to come aboard--I suddenly remembered; but I\ncould not tell Herr Davies.'\n\n'I see,' I answered. 'I will tell him.'\n\n'Yes, that he must not come near us.\n\n'He will understand. I know he will be very sorry, but,' I added,\nfirmly, 'you can trust him implicitly to do the right thing.' And how\nI prayed that this would content her! Thank Heaven, it did.\n\n'Yes,' she said, 'I am afraid I did not say good-bye to him. You will\ndo so?' She gave me her hand.\n\n'One thing more,' I added, holding it, 'nothing had better be said\nabout this meeting?'\n\n'No, no, nothing. It must never be known.'\n\nI let go the gig's gunwale and watched her tighten her sheet and make\na tack or two to windward. Then I rowed back to the _Dulcibella_ as\nhard as I could.\n\n\n\n\nXX. The Little Drab Book\n\n\nI FOUND Davies at the cabin table, surrounded with a litter of books.\nThe shelf was empty, and its contents were tossed about among the\ncups and on the floor. We both spoke together.\n\n'Well, what was it?'\n\n'Well, what did she say?'\n\nI gave way, and told my story briefly. He listened in silence,\ndrumming on the table with a book which he held.\n\n'It's not good-bye,' he said. 'But I don't wonder; look here!' and he\nheld out to me a small volume, whose appearance was quite familiar to\nme, if its contents were less so. As I noted in an early chapter,\nDavies's library, excluding tide-tables, 'pilots', etc., was limited\nto two classes of books, those on naval warfare, and those on his own\nhobby, cruising in small yachts. He had six or seven of the latter,\nincluding Knight's _Falcon in the Baltic,_ Cowper's _Sailing Tours,_\nMacmullen's _Down Channel_, and other less known stories of adventurous\ntravel. I had scarcely done more than look into some of them at\noff-moments, for our life had left no leisure for reading. This\nparticular volume was--no, I had better not describe it too fully;\nbut I will say that it was old and unpretentious, bound in cheap\ncloth of a rather antiquated style, with a title which showed it to\nbe a guide for yachtsmen to a certain British estuary. A white label\npartly scratched away bore the legend '3_d_.' I had glanced at it once\nor twice with no special interest.\n\n'Well?' I said, turning over some yellow pages.\n\n'Dollmann!' cried Davies. 'Dollmann wrote it.' I turned to the\ntitle-page, and read: 'By Lieut. X----, R.N.' The name itself conveyed\nnothing to me, but I began to understand. Davies went on: 'The name's\non the back, too--and I'm certain it's the last she looked at.'\n\n'But how do you know?'\n\n'And there's the man himself. Ass that I am not to have seen it\nbefore! Look at the frontispiece.'\n\nIt was a sorry piece of illustration of the old-fashioned sort,\nlacking definition and finish, but effective notwithstanding; for it\nwas evidently the reproduction, though a cheap and imperfect process,\nof a photograph. It represented a small yacht at anchor below some\nwoods, with the owner standing on deck in his shirt sleeves: a\nwell-knit, powerful man, young, of middle height, clean shaved. There\nappeared to be nothing remarkable about the face; the portrait being\non too small a scale, and the expression, such as it was, being of\nthe fixed 'photographic' character.\n\n'How do you know him? You said he was fifty, with a greyish beard.'\n\n'By the shape of his head; that hasn't changed. Look how it widens at\nthe top, and then flattens--sort of wedge shaped--with a high, steep\nforehead; you'd hardly notice it in that' (the points were not very\nnoticeable, but I saw what Davies meant). 'The height and figure are\nright, too; and the dates are about right. Look at the bottom.'\n\nUnderneath the picture was the name of a yacht and a date. The\npublisher's date on the title-page was the same.\n\n'Sixteen years ago,' said Davies. 'He looks thirty odd in that,\ndoesn't he? And fifty now.'\n\n'Let's work the thing out. Sixteen years ago he was still an Englishman,\nan officer in Her Majesty's Navy. Now he's a German. At some time\nbetween this and then, I suppose, he came to grief--disgrace, flight,\nexile. When did it happen?'\n\n'They've been here three years; von Br\u00c3\u00bcning said so.'\n\n'It was long before that. She has talked German from a child. What's\nher age, do you think--nineteen or twenty?'\n\n'About that.'\n\n'Say she was four when this book was published. The crash must have\ncome not long after.'\n\n'And they've been hiding in Germany since.\n\n'Is this a well-known book?'\n\n'I never saw another copy; picked this up on a second-hand bookstall\nfor threepence.'\n\n'She looked at it, you say?'\n\n'Yes, I'm certain of it.'\n\n'Was she never on board you in September?'\n\n'No; I asked them both, but Dollmann made excuses.'\n\n'But _he--he_ came on board? You told me so.'\n\n'Once; he asked himself to breakfast on the first day. By Jove! yes;\nyou mean he saw the book?\n\n'It explains a good deal.'\n\n'It explains everything.'\n\nWe fell into deep reflexion for a minute or two.\n\n'Do you really mean _everything_?' I said. 'In that case let's sail\nstraight away and forget the whole affair. He's only some poor devil\nwith a past, whose secret you stumbled on, and, half mad with fear,\nhe tried to silence you. But you don't want revenge, so it's no\nbusiness of ours. We can ruin him if we like; but is it worth it?'\n\n'You don't mean a word you're saying,' said Davies, 'though I know\nwhy you say it; and many thanks, old chap. I didn't mean\n\"everything\". He's plotting with Germans, or why did Grimm spy on us,\nand von Br\u00c3\u00bcning cross-examine us? We've got to find out what he's at,\nas well as who he is. And as to her--what do you think of her now?'\n\nI made my _amende_ heartily. 'Innocent and ignorant,' was my verdict.\n'Ignorant, that is, of her father's treasonable machinations; but\naware, clearly, that they were English refugees with a past to hide.'\nI said other things, but they do not matter. 'Only,' I concluded, 'it\nmakes the dilemma infinitely worse.'\n\n'There's no dilemma at all,' said Davies. 'You said at Bensersiel\nthat we couldn't hurt him without hurting her. Well, all I can say\nis, we've _got_ to. The time to cut and run, if ever, was when we\nsighted her dinghy. I had a baddish minute then.'\n\n'She's given us a clue or two after all.'\n\n'It wasn't our fault. To refuse to have her on board would have been\nto give our show away; and the very fact that she's given us clues\ndecides the matter. She mustn't suffer for it.'\n\n'What will she do?'\n\n'Stick to her father, I suppose.'\n\n'And what shall we do?'\n\n'I don't know yet; how can I know? It depends,' said Davies, slowly.\n'But the point is, that we have two objects, equally important--yes,\nequally, by Jove!--to scotch him, and save her.'\n\nThere was a pause.\n\n'That's rather a large order,' I observed. 'Do you realize that at\nthis very moment we have probably gained the first object? If we went\nhome now, walked into the Admiralty and laid our facts before them,\nwhat would be the result?'\n\n'The Admiralty!' said Davies, with ineffable scorn.\n\n'Well, Scotland Yard, too, then. Both of them want our man, I dare\nsay. It would be strange if between them they couldn't dislodge him,\nand, incidentally, either discover what's going on here or draw such\nattention to this bit of coast as to make further secrecy\nimpossible.'\n\n'It's out of the question to let her betray her father, and then run\naway! Besides, we don't know enough, and they mightn't believe us.\nIt's a cowardly course, however you look at it.'\n\n'Oh! that settles it,' I answered, hastily. 'Now I want to go back\nover the facts. When did you first see her?'\n\n'That first morning.'\n\n'She wasn't in the saloon the night before?'\n\n'No; and he didn't mention her.'\n\n'You would have gone away next morning if he hadn't called?'\n\n'Yes; I told you so.'\n\n'He allowed her to persuade you to make that voyage with them?'\n\n'I suppose so.'\n\n'But he sent her below when the pilotage was going on?'\n\n'Of course.'\n\n'She said just now, \"Father said you would be safe.\" What had you\nbeen saying to her?'\n\n'It was when I met her on the sand. (By the way, it wasn't a chance\nmeeting; she had been making inquiries and heard about us from a\nskipper who had seen the yacht near Wangeroog, and she had been down\nthis way before.) She asked at once about that day, and began\napologizing, rather awkwardly, you know, for their rudeness in not\nhaving waited for me at Cuxhaven. Her father found he must get on to\nHamburg at once.'\n\n'But you didn't go to Cuxhaven; you told her that? What exactly _did_\nyou tell her? This is important.'\n\n'I was in a fearful fix, not knowing what _he_ had told her. So I\nsaid something vague, and then she asked the very question von\nBr\u00c3\u00bcning did, \"Wasn't there a _schrecklich_ sea round the Scharhorn?\"'\n\n'She didn't know you took the short cut, then?'\n\n'No; he hadn't dared to tell her.'\n\n'She knew that _they_ took it?'\n\n'Yes. He couldn't possibly have hidden that. She would have known by\nthe look of the sea from the portholes, the shorter time, etc.'\n\n'But when the 'Medusa' hove to and he shouted to you to follow\nhim--didn't she understand what was happening?'\n\n'No, evidently not. Mind you, she couldn't possibly have heard what\nwe said, in that weather, from below. I couldn't cross-question her,\nbut it was clear enough what she thought; namely, that he had hove to\nfor exactly the opposite reason, to say _he_ was taking the short\ncut, and that I wasn't to attempt to follow him.'\n\n'That's why she laid stress on _waiting_ for you at Cuxhaven?'\n\n'Of course; mine would have been the longer passage.'\n\n'She had no notion of foul play?'\n\n'None--that I could see. After all, there I was, alive and well.'\n\n'But she was remorseful for having induced you to sail at all that\nday, and for not having waited to see you arrived safely.'\n\n'That's about it.'\n\n'Now what did you say about Cuxhaven?'\n\n'Nothing. I let her understand that I went there, and, not finding\nthem, went on to the Baltic by the Eider river, having changed my\nmind about the ship canal.'\n\n'Now, what about her voyage back from Hamburg? Was she alone?'\n\n'No; the stepmother joined her.'\n\n'Did she say she had inquired about you at Brunsb\u00c3\u00bcttel?'\n\n'No; I suppose she didn't like to. And there was no need, because my\ntaking the Eider explained it.'\n\nI reflected. 'You're sure she hadn't a notion that you took the short\ncut?'\n\n'Quite sure; but she may guess it now. She guessed foul play by\nseeing that book.'\n\n'Of course she did; but I was thinking of something else. There are\ntwo stories afloat now--yours to von Br\u00c3\u00bcning, the true one, that you\nfollowed the 'Medusa' to the short cut; and Dollmann's to her, that you\nwent round the Scharhorn. That's evidently his version of the\naffair--the version he would have given if you had been drowned and\ninquiries were ever made; the version he would have sworn his crew to\nif they discovered the truth.'\n\n'But he must drop that yarn when he knows I'm alive and back again.'\n\n'Yes; but meanwhile, supposing von Br\u00c3\u00bcning sees him _before_ he knows\nyou're back again, and wants to find out the truth about that\nincident. If I were von Br\u00c3\u00bcning I should say, \"By the way, what's\nbecome of that young Englishman you decoyed away to the Baltic?\"\nDollmann would give his version, and von Br\u00c3\u00bcning, having heard ours,\nwould know he was lying, and had tried to drown you.'\n\n'Does it matter? He must know already that Dollmann's a scoundrel.'\n\n'So we've been supposing; but we may be wrong. We're still in the\ndark as to Dollmann's position towards these Germans. They may not\neven know he's English, or they may know that and not know his real\nname and past. What effect your story will have on their relations\nwith him we can't forecast. But I'm clear about one thing, that it's\nour paramount interest to maintain the _status quo_ as long as we\ncan, to minimize the danger you ran that day, and act as witnesses in\nhis defence. We can't do that if his story and yours don't tally. The\ndiscrepancy will not only damn him (that may be immaterial), but it\nwill throw doubt on us.'\n\n'Why?'\n\n'Because if the short cut was so dangerous that he dared not own to\nhaving led you to it, it was dangerous enough to make you suspect\nfoul play; the very supposition we want to avoid. We want to be\nthought mere travellers, with no scores to wipe out, and no secrets\nto pry after.'\n\n'Well, what do you propose?'\n\n'Hitherto I believe we stand fairly well. Let's assume we hoodwinked\nvon Br\u00c3\u00bcning at Bensersiel, and base our policy on that assumption. It\nfollows that we must show Dollmann at the earliest possible moment\nthat you _have_ come back, and give him time to revise his tactics\nbefore he commits himself. Now----'\n\n'But _she'll_ tell him we're back,' interrupted Davies.\n\n'I don't think so. We've just agreed to keep this afternoon's episode\na secret. She expects never to see us again.'\n\n'Now, he comes to-morrow by the morning boat, she said. What did that\nmean? Boat from where?'\n\n'I know. From Norddeich on the mainland opposite. There's a railway\nthere from Norden, and a steam ferry crosses to the island.'\n\n'At what time?'\n\n'Your Bradshaw will tell us--here it is: \"Winter Service, 8.30 a.m.,\ndue at 9.5.\"'\n\n'Let's get away at once.'\n\nWe had a tussle with the tide at first, but once over the watershed\nthe channel improved, and the haze lightened gradually. A lighthouse\nappeared among the sand-dunes on the island shore, and before\ndarkness fell we dimly saw the spires and roofs of a town, and two\nlong black piers stretching out southwards. We were scarcely a mile\naway when we lost our wind altogether, and had to anchor. Determined\nto reach our destination that night we waited till the ebb stream\nmade, and then towed the yacht with the dinghy. In the course of this\na fog dropped on us suddenly, just as it had yesterday. I was towing\nat the time, and, of course, stopped short; but Davies shouted to me\nfrom the tiller to go on, that he could manage with the lead and\ncompass. And the end of it was that, at about nine o'clock, we\nanchored safely in the five-fathom roadstead, close to the eastern\npier, as a short reconnaissance proved to us. It had been a little\nmasterpiece of adroit seamanship.\n\nThere was utter stillness till our chain rattled down, when a muffled\nshout came from the direction of the pier, and soon we heard a boat\ngroping out to us. It was a polite but sleepy port-officer, who asked\nin a perfunctory way for our particulars, and when he heard them,\nremembered the _Dulcibella_s' previous visit.\n\n'Where are you bound to?' he asked.\n\n'England--sooner or later,' said Davies.\n\nThe man laughed derisively. 'Not this year,' he said; 'there will be\nfogs for another week; it is always so, and then storms. Better leave\nyour yawl here. Dues will be only sixpence a month for you.\n\n'I'll think about it,' said Davies. 'Good-night.'\n\nThe man vanished like a ghost in the thick night.\n\n'Is the post-office open?' I called after him.\n\n'No; eight to-morrow,' came back out of the fog.\n\nWe were too excited to sup in comfort, or sleep in peace, or to do\nanything but plan and speculate. Never till this night had we talked\nwith absolute mutual confidence, for Davies broke down the last\nbarriers of reserve and let me see his whole mind. He loved this girl\nand he loved his country, two simple passions which for the time\nabsorbed his whole moral capacity. There was no room left for\ncasuistry. To weigh one passion against the other, with the\ndiscordant voices of honour and expediency dinning in his ears, had\ntoo long involved him in fruitless torture. Both were right; neither\ncould be surrendered. If the facts showed them irreconcilable, _tant\npis pour les faits._ A way must be found to satisfy both or neither.\n\nI should have been a spiritless dog if I had not risen to his mood.\nBut in truth his cutting of the knot was at this juncture exactly\nwhat appealed to me. I, too, was tired of vicarious casuistry, and\nthe fascination of our enterprise, intensified by the discovery of\nthat afternoon, had never been so strong in me. Not to be insincere,\nI cannot pretend that I viewed the situation with his single mind. My\nphilosophy when I left London was of a very worldly sort, and no one\ncan change his temperament in three weeks. I plainly said as much to\nDavies, and indeed took perverse satisfaction in stating with brutal\nemphasis some social truths which bore on this attachment of his to\nthe daughter of an outlaw. Truths I call them, but I uttered them\nmore by rote than by conviction, and he heard them unmoved. And\nmeanwhile I snatched recklessly at his own solution. If it imparted\ninto our adventure a strain of crazy chivalry more suited to\nknights-errant of the Middle Ages than to sober modern youths--well,\nthank Heaven, I was not too sober, and still young enough to snatch\nat that fancy with an ardour of imagination, if not of character;\nperhaps, too, of character, for Galahads are not so common but that\nordinary folk must needs draw courage from their example and put\nsomething of a blind trust in their tenfold strength.\n\nTo reduce a romantic ideal to a working plan is a very difficult\nthing.\n\n'We shall have to argue backwards,' I said. 'What is to be the final\nstage? Because that must govern the others.'\n\nThere was only one answer--to get Dollmann, secrets and all, daughter\nand all, away from Germany altogether. So only could we satisfy the\ndouble aim we had set before us. What a joy it is, when beset with\ndoubts, to find a bed-rock necessity, however unattainable! We\nfastened on this one and reasoned back from it. The first lesson was\nthat, however many and strong were the enemies we had to contend\nwith, our sole overt foe must be Dollmann. The issue of the struggle\nmust be known only to ourselves and him. If we won, and found out\n'what he was at', we must at all costs conceal our success from his\nGerman friends, and detach him from them before he was compromised.\n(You will remark that to blithely accept this limitation showed a\nvery sanguine spirit in us.) The next question, how to find out what\nhe was at, was a deal more thorny. If it had not been for the\ndiscovery of Dollmann's identity, we should have found it as hard a\nnut to crack as ever. But this discovery was illuminating. It threw\ninto relief two methods of action which hitherto we had been hazily\nseeking to combine, seesawing between one and the other, each of us\ninfluenced at different times by different motives. One was to rely\non independent research; the other to extort the secret from Dollmann\ndirect, by craft or threats. The moral of to-day was to abandon the\nfirst and embrace the second.\n\nThe prospects of independent research were not a whit better than\nbefore. There were only two theories in the field, the channel theory\nand the Memmert theory. The former languished for lack of\ncorroboration; the latter also appeared to be weakened. To Fr\u00c3\u00a4ulein\nDollmann the wreck-works were evidently what they purported to be,\nand nothing more. This fact in itself was unimportant, for it was\nclear as crystal that she was no party to her father's treacherous\nintrigues, if he was engaged in such. But if Memmert was his sphere\nfor them, it was disconcerting to find her so familiar with that\nsphere, lightly talking of a descent in a diving-bell--hinting, too,\nthat the mystery as to results was only for local consumption.\nNevertheless, the charm of Memmert as the place we had traced Grimm\nto, and as the only tangible clue we had obtained, was still very\ngreat. The really cogent objection was the insuperable difficulty,\nknown and watched as we were, of learning its significance. If there\nwas anything important to see there we should never be allowed to see\nit, while by trying and failing we risked everything. It was on this\npoint that the last of all misunderstandings between me and Davies\nwas dissipated. At Bensersiel he had been influenced more than he\nowned by my arguments about Memmert; but at that time (as I hinted)\nhe was biased by a radical prejudice. The channel theory had become a\nsort of religion with him, promising double salvation--not only\navoidance of the Dollmanns, but success in the quest by methods in\nwhich he was past master. To have to desert it and resort to spying\non naval defences was an idea he dreaded and distrusted. It was not\nthe morality of the course that bothered him. He was far too\nclear-headed to blink at the essential fact that at heart we were\nspies on a foreign power in time of peace, or to salve his conscience\nby specious distinctions as to our mode of operation. The foreign\npower to him was Dollmann, a traitor. There was his final\njustification, fearlessly adopted and held to the last. It was rather\nthat, knowing his own limitations, his whole nature shrank from the\nsort of action entailed by the Memmert theory. And there was strong\ncommon sense in his antipathy.\n\nSo much for independent research.\n\nOn the other hand the road was now clear for the other method. Davies\nno longer feared to face the imbroglio at Norderney; and that day\nfortune had given us a new and potent weapon against Dollmann;\nprecisely how potent we could not tell, for we had only a glimpse of\nhis past, and his exact relations with the Government were unknown to\nus. But we knew who he was. Using this knowledge with address, could\nwe not wring the rest from him? Feel our way, of course, be guided by\nhis own conduct, but in the end strike hard and stake everything on\nthe stroke? Such at any rate was our scheme to-night. Later, tossing\nin my bunk, I bethought me of the little drab book, lit a candle,\nand fetched it. A preface explained that it had been written during a\nspell of two months' leave from naval duty, and expressed a hope that\nit might be of service to Corinthian sailors. The style was\nunadorned, but scholarly and pithy. There was no trace of the\nwriter's individuality, save a certain subdued relish in describing\nbanks and shoals, which reminded me of Davies himself. For the rest,\nI found the book dull, and, in fact, it sent me to sleep.\n\n\n\n\nXXI. Blindfold to Memmert\n\n\n'HERE she comes,' said Davies. It was nine o'clock on the next day,\nOctober 22, and we were on deck waiting for the arrival of the\nsteamer from Norddeich. There was no change in the weather--still the\nsame stringent cold, with a high barometer, and only fickle flaws of\nair; but the morning was gloriously clear, except for a wreath or two\nof mist curling like smoke from the sea, and an attenuated belt of\nopaque fog on the northern horizon. The harbour lay open before us,\nand very commodious and civilized it looked, enclosed between two\nlong piers which ran quite half a mile out from the land to the\nroadstead (Riff Gat by name) where we lay. A stranger might have\ntaken it for a deep and spacious haven; but this, of course, was an\nillusion, due to the high water. Davies knew that three-quarters of\nit was mud, the remainder being a dredged-out channel along the\nwestern pier. A couple of tugs, a dredger, and a ferry packet with\nsteam up, were moored on that side--a small stack of galliots on the\nother. Beyond these was another vessel, a galliot in build, but\nradiant as a queen among sluts; her varnished sides and spars\nflashing orange in the sun. These, and her snow-white sailcovers and\nthe twinkle of brass and gun-metal, proclaimed her to be a yacht. I\nhad already studied her through the glasses and read on her stern\n'Medusa'. A couple of sailors were swabbing her decks; you could hear\nthe slush of the water and the scratching of the deck-brooms. '_They_\ncan see us anyway,' Davies had said.\n\nFor that matter all the world could see us--certainly the incoming\nsteamer must; for we lay as near to the pier as safety permitted,\nabreast of the berth she would occupy, as we knew by a gangway and a\nknot of sailors.\n\nA packet boat, not bigger than a big tug, was approaching from the\nsouth.\n\n'Remember, we're not supposed to know he's coming,' I said; 'let's go\nbelow.' Besides the skylight, our 'coach-house' cabin top had little\noblong side windows. We wiped clean those on the port side and\nwatched events from them, kneeling on the sofa.\n\nThe steamer backed her paddles, flinging out a wash that set us\nrolling to our scuppers. There seemed to be very few passengers\naboard, but all of them were gazing at the _Dulcibella_ while the\npacket was warped alongside. On the forward deck there were some\nmarket-women with baskets, a postman, and a weedy youth who might be\nan hotel-waiter; on the after-deck, standing close together, were two\nmen in ulsters and soft felt hats.\n\n'There he is!' said Davies, in a tense whisper; 'the tall one.' But\nthe tall one turned abruptly as Davies spoke and strode away behind\nthe deck-house, leaving me just a lightning impression of a grey\nbeard and a steep tanned forehead, behind a cloud of cigar-smoke. It\nwas perverse of me, but, to tell the truth, I hardly missed him, so\noccupied was I by the short one, who remained leaning on the rail,\nthoughtfully contemplating the _Dulcibella_ through gold-rimmed\npince-nez: a sallow, wizened old fellow, beetlebrowed, with a bush of\ngrizzled moustache and a jet-black tuft of beard on his chin. The\nmost remarkable feature was the nose, which was broad and flat,\nmerging almost imperceptibly in the wrinkled cheeks. Lightly beaked\nat the nether extremity, it drooped towards an enormous cigar which\nwas pointing at us like a gun just discharged. He looked wise as\nSatan, and you would say he was smiling inwardly.\n\n'Who's that?' I whispered to Davies. (There was no need to talk in\nwhispers, but we did so instinctively.)\n\n'Can't think,' said Davies. 'Hullo! she's backing off, and they've\nnot landed.'\n\nSome parcels and mail-bags had been thrown up, and the weedy waiter\nand two market-women had gone up the gangway, which was now being\nhauled up, and were standing on the quay. I think one or two other\npersons had first come aboard unnoticed by us, but at the last moment\na man we had not seen before jumped down to the forward deck.\n'Grimm!' we both ejaculated at once.\n\nThe steamer whistled sharply, circled backwards into the roadstead,\nand then steamed away. The pier soon hid her, but her smoke showed\nshe was steering towards the North Sea.\n\n'What does this mean?' I asked.\n\n'There must be some other quay to stop at nearer the town,' said\nDavies. 'Let's go ashore and get your letters.'\n\nWe had made a long and painful toilette that morning, and felt quite\nshy of one another as we sculled towards the pier, in much-creased\nblue suits, conventional collars, and brown boots. It was the first\ntime for two years that I had seen Davies in anything approaching a\nrespectable garb; but a fashionable watering-place, even in the dead\nseason, exacts respect; and, besides, we had friends to visit.\n\nWe tied up the dinghy to an iron ladder, and on the pier found our\ninquisitor of the night before smoking in the doorway of a shed\nmarked 'Harbour Master'. After some civilities we inquired about the\nsteamer. The answer was that it was Saturday, and she had, therefore,\ngone on to Juist. Did we want a good hotel? The 'Vier Jahreszeiten'\nwas still open, etc.\n\n'Juist, by Jove!' said Davies, as we walked on. 'Why are those three\ngoing to Juist?'\n\n'I should have thought it was pretty clear. They're on their way to\nMemmert.'\n\nDavies agreed, and we both looked longingly westward at a\nstraw-coloured streak on the sea.\n\n'Is it some meeting, do you think?' said Davies.\n\n'Looks like it. We shall probably find the 'Kormoran' here,\nwind-bound.'\n\nAnd find her we did soon after, the outermost of the stack of\ngalliots, on the farther side of the harbour. Two men, whose faces we\ntook a good look at, were sitting on her hatch, mending a sail.\n\nFlooded with sun, yet still as the grave, the town was like a dead\nbutterfly for whom the healing rays had come too late. We crossed some\ndeserted public gardens commanded by a gorgeous casino, its porticos\nheaped with chairs and tables; so past kiosques and _caf\u00c3\u00a9s,_ great white\nhotels with boarded windows, bazaars and booths, and all the stale lees\nof vulgar frivolity, to the post-office, which at least was alive. I\nreceived a packet of letters and purchased a local time-table, from\nwhich we learned that the steamer sailed daily to Borkum _via_\nNorderney, touching three times a week at Juist (weather permitting). On\nthe return journey to-day it was due at Norderney at 7.30 p.m. Then I\ninquired the way to the 'Vier Jahreszeiten'. 'For whatever your\nprinciples, Davies,' I said, 'we are going to have the best breakfast\nmoney can buy! We've got the whole day before us.'\n\nThe 'Four Seasons' Hotel was on the esplanade facing the northern\nbeach. Living up to its name, it announced on an illuminated\nsignboard, 'Inclusive terms for winter visitors; special attention\nto invalids, etc.' Here in a great glass restaurant, with the\nunruffled blue of ocean spread out before us, we ate the king of\nbreakfasts, dismissed the waiter, and over long and fragrant Havanas\nexamined my mail at leisure.\n\n'What a waste of good diplomacy!' was my first thought, for nothing\nhad been tampered with, so far as we could judge from the minutest\nscrutiny, directed, of course, in particular to the franked official\nletters (for to my surprise there were two) from Whitehall.\n\nThe first in order of date (October 6) ran: 'Dear Carruthers.--Take\nanother week by all means.--Yours, etc.'\n\nThe second (marked 'urgent') had been sent to my home address and\nforwarded. It was dated October 15, and cancelled the previous\nletter, requesting me to return to London without delay--'I am sorry\nto abridge your holiday, but we are very busy, and, at present,\nshort-handed.--Yours, etc.' There was a dry postscript to the effect\nthat another time I was to be good enough to leave more regular and\ndefinite information as to my whereabouts when absent.\n\n'I'm afraid I never got this!' I said, handing it to Davies.\n\n'You won't go, will you?' said he, looking, nevertheless, with\nunconcealed awe at the great man's handwriting under the haughty\nofficial crest. Meanwhile I discovered an endorsement on a corner of\nthe envelope: 'Don't worry; it's only the chief's fuss.--M----' I\npromptly tore up the envelope. There are domestic mysteries which it\nwould be indecent and disloyal to reveal, even to one's best friend.\nThe rest of my letters need no remark; I smiled over some and blushed\nover others--all were voices from a life which was infinitely far\naway. Davies, meanwhile, was deep in the foreign intelligence of a\nnewspaper, spelling it out line by line, and referring impatiently to\nme for the meaning of words.\n\n'Hullo!' he said, suddenly; 'same old game! Hear that siren?' A\ncurtain of fog had grown on the northern horizon and was drawing\nshorewards slowly but surely.\n\n'It doesn't matter, does it?' I said.\n\n'Well, we must get back to the yacht. We can't leave her alone in the\nfog.'\n\nThere was some marketing to be done on the way back, and in the\ncourse of looking for the shops we wanted we came on the Schwannall\u00c3\u00a9e\nand noted its position. Before we reached the harbour the fog was on\nus, charging up the streets in dense masses. Happily a tramline led\nright up to the pier-head, or we should have lost our way and wasted\ntime, which, in the event, was of priceless value. Presently we\nstumbled up against the Harbour Office, which was our landmark for\nthe steps where we had tied up the dinghy. The same official appeared\nand good-naturedly held the painter while we handed in our parcels.\nHe wanted to know why we had left the flesh-pots of the 'Vier\nJahreszeiten'. To look after our yacht, of course. There was no need,\nhe objected; there would be no traffic moving while the fog lasted,\nand the fog, having come on at that hour, had come to stay. If it did\nclear he would keep an eye on the yacht for us. We thanked him, but\nthought we would go aboard.\n\n'You'll have a job to find her now,' he said.\n\nThe distance was eighty yards at the most, but we had to use a\nscientific method, the same one, in fact, that Davies had used last\nnight in the approach to the eastern pier.\n\n'Row straight out at right angles to the pier,' he said now. I did\nso, Davies sounding with his scull between the strokes. He found the\nbottom after twenty yards, that being the width of the dredged-out\nchannel at this point. Then we turned to the right, and moved gently\nforward, keeping touch with the edge of the mud-bank (for all the\nworld like blind men tapping along a kerbstone) and taking short\nexcursions from it, till the _Dulcibella_ hove in view. 'That's partly\nluck,' Davies commented; 'we ought to have had the compass as well.'\n\nWe exchanged shouts with the man on the pier to show we had arrived.\n\n[Illustration: Chart B of Juist, Memmert, and Part of Norderney]\n\n'It's very good practice, that sort of thing,' said Davies, when we\nhad disembarked.\n\n'You've got a sixth sense,' I observed. 'How far could you go like\nthat?'\n\n'Don't know. Let's have another try. I can't sit still all day. Let's\nexplore this channel.'\n\n'_Why not go to Memmert?'_ I said, in fun.\n\n'To Memmert?' said Davies, slowly; 'by Jove! that's an idea!'\n\n'Good Heavens, man! I was joking. Why, it's ten mortal miles.'\n\n'More,' said Davies, absently. 'It's not so much the distance--what's\nthe time? Ten fifteen; quarter ebb---- What am I talking about? We made\nour plans last night.'\n\nBut seeing him, to my amazement, serious, I was stung by the\nsplendour of the idea I had awakened. Confidence in his skill was\nsecond nature to me. I swept straight on to the logic of the thing,\nthe greatness, the completeness of the opportunity, if by a miracle\nit could be seized and used. Something was going on at Memmert\nto-day; our men had gone there; here were we, ten miles away, in a\nsmothering, blinding fog. It was known we were here--Dollmann and\nGrimm knew it; the crew of the 'Medusa' knew it; the crew of the\n'Kormoran' knew it; the man on the pier, whether he cared or not, knew\nit. But none of them knew Davies as I knew him. Would anyone dream\nfor an instant----?\n\n'Stop a second,' said Davies; 'give me two minutes.' He whipped out\nthe German chart. 'Where exactly should we go?' ('Exactly!' The word\ntickled me hugely.)\n\n'To the dep\u00c3\u00b4t, of course; it's our only chance.'\n\n'Listen then--there are two routes: the outside one by the open sea,\nright round Juist, and doubling south--the simplest, but the longest;\nthe dep\u00c3\u00b4t's at the south point of Memmert, and Memmert's nearly two\nmiles long.' _[See Chart B]_\n\n'How far would that way be?'\n\n'Sixteen miles good. And we should have to row in a breaking swell\nmost of the way, close to land.'\n\n'Out of the question; it's too public, too, if it clears. The steamer\nwent that way, and will come back that way. We must go inside over\nthe sands. Am I dreaming, though? Can you possibly find the way?'\n\n'I shouldn't wonder. But I don't believe you see the hitch. It's the\n_time_ and the falling tide. High water was about 8.15: it's now\n10.15, and all those sands are drying off. We must cross the See Gat\nand strike that boomed channel, the Memmert Balje; strike it, freeze\non to it--can't cut off an inch--and pass that \"watershed\" you see\nthere before it's too late. It's an infernally bad one, I can see.\nNot even a dinghy will cross it for an hour each side of low water.'\n\n'Well, how far is the \"watershed\"?'\n\n'Good Lord! What are we talking for? Change, man, change! Talk while\nwe're changing.' (He began flinging off his shore clothes, and I did\nthe same.) 'It's at least five miles to the end of it; six, allowing\nfor bends; hour and a half hard pulling; two, allowing for checks.\nAre you fit? You'll have to pull the most. Then there are six or\nseven more miles--easier ones. And then--What are we to do when we\nget there?'\n\n'Leave that to me,' I said. 'You get me there.'\n\n'Supposing it clears?'\n\n'After we get there? Bad; but we must risk that. If it clears on the\nway there it doesn't matter by this route; we shall be miles from\nland.'\n\n'What about getting back?'\n\n'We shall have a rising tide, anyway. If the fog lasts--can you\nmanage in a fog _and_ dark?'\n\n'The dark makes it no more difficult, if we've a light to see the\ncompass and chart by. You trim the binnacle lamp--no, the\nriding-light. Now give me the scissors, and don't speak a word for\nten minutes. Meanwhile, think it out, and load the dinghy--(by Jove!\nthough, don't make a sound)--some grub and whisky, the boat-compass,\nlead, riding-light, matches, _small_ boathook, grapnel and line.'\n\n'Foghorn?'\n\n'Yes, and the whistle too.'\n\n'A gun?'\n\n'What for?'\n\n'We're after ducks.'\n\n'All right. And muffle the rowlocks with cotton-waste.'\n\nI left Davies absorbed in the charts, and softly went about my own\nfunctions. In ten minutes he was on the ladder, beckoning.\n\n'I've done,' he whispered. 'Now _shall_ we go?'\n\n'I've thought it out. Yes,' I answered.\n\nThis was only roughly true, for I could not have stated in words all\nthe pros and cons that I had balanced. It was an impulse that drove\nme forward; but an impulse founded on reason, with just a tinge,\nperhaps, of superstition; for the quest had begun in a fog and might\nfitly end in one.\n\nIt was twenty-five minutes to eleven when we noiselessly pushed off.\n'Let her drift,' whispered Davies, 'the ebb'll carry her past the\npier.'\n\nWe slid by the _Dulcibella_, and she disappeared. Then we sat without\nspeech or movement for about five minutes, while the gurgle of tide\nthrough piles approached and passed. The dinghy appeared to be\nmotionless, just as a balloon in the clouds may appear to its\noccupants to be motionless, though urged by a current of air. In\nreality we were driving out of the Riff Gat into the See Gat. The\ndinghy swayed to a light swell.\n\n'Now, pull,' said Davies, under his breath; 'keep it long and steady,\nabove all steady--both arms with equal force.'\n\nI was on the bow-thwart; he _vis-\u00c3\u00a0-vis_ to me on the stern seat, his\nleft hand behind him on the tiller, his right forefinger on a small\nsquare of paper which lay on his knees; this was a section cut out\nfrom the big German chart. _[See Chart B]_ On the midship-thwart\nbetween us lay the compass and a watch. Between these three\nobjects--compass, watch, and chart--his eyes darted constantly, never\nlooking up or out, save occasionally for a sharp glance over the side\nat the flying bubbles, to see if I was sustaining a regular speed. My\nduty was to be his automaton, the human equivalent of a marine engine\nwhose revolutions can be counted and used as data by the navigator.\nMy arms must be regular as twin pistons; the energy that drove them\nas controllable as steam. It was a hard ideal to reach, for the\ncomplex mortal tends to rely on all the senses God has given him, so\nunfitting himself for mechanical exactitude when a sense (eyesight,\nin my case) fails him. At first it was constantly 'left' or 'right'\nfrom Davies, accompanied by a bubbling from the rudder.\n\n'This won't do, too much helm,' said Davies, without looking up.\n'Keep your stroke, but listen to me. Can you see the compass card?'\n\n'When I come forward.'\n\n'Take your time, and don't get flurried, but each time you come\nforward have a good look at it. The course is sou'-west half-west.\nYou take the opposite, north-east half-east, and keep her _stern_ on\nthat. It'll be rough, but it'll save some helm, and give me a hand\nfree if I want it.'\n\nI did as he said, not without effort, and our progress gradually\nbecame smoother, till he had no need to speak at all. The only sound\nnow was one like the gentle simmer of a saucepan away to port--the\nlisp of surf I knew it to be--and the muffled grunt of the rowlocks.\nI broke the silence once to say 'It's very shallow.' I had touched\nsand with my right scull.\n\n'Don't talk,' said Davies.\n\nAbout half an hour passed, and then he added sounding to his other\noccupations. 'Plump' went the lead at regular intervals, and he\nsteered with his hip while pulling in the line. Very little of it\nwent out at first, then less still. Again I struck bottom, and,\nglancing aside, saw weeds. Suddenly he got a deep cast, and the\ndinghy, freed from the slight drag which shallow water always\ninflicts on a small boat, leapt buoyantly forward. At the same time,\nI knew by boils on the smooth surface that we were in a strong\ntideway.\n\n'The Buse Tief,' _[See Chart B]_ muttered Davies. 'Row hard now, and\nsteady as a clock.'\n\nFor a hundred yards or more I bent to my sculls and made her fly.\nDavies was getting six fathom casts, till, just as suddenly as it had\ndeepened, the water shoaled--ten feet, six, three, one--the dinghy\ngrounded.\n\n'Good!' said Davies. 'Back her off! Pull your right only.' The dinghy\nspun round with her bow to N.N.W. 'Both arms together! Don't you\nworry about the compass now; just pull, and listen for orders.\nThere's a tricky bit coming.'\n\nHe put aside the chart, kicked the lead under the seat, and, kneeling\non the dripping coils of line, sounded continuously with the butt-end\nof the boathook, a stumpy little implement, notched at intervals of\na foot, and often before used for the same purpose. All at once I was\naware that a check had come, for the dinghy swerved and doubled like\na hound ranging after scent.\n\n'Stop her,' he said, suddenly, 'and throw out the grapnel.'\n\nI obeyed and we brought up, swinging to a slight current, whose\ndirection Davies verified by the compass. Then for half a minute he\ngave himself up to concentrated thought. What struck me most about\nhim was that he never for a moment strained his eyes through the fog;\na useless exercise (for five yards or so was the radius of our\nvision) which, however, I could not help indulging in, while I\nrested. He made up his mind, and we were off again, straight and\nswift as an arrow this time, and in water deeper than the boathook.\nI could see by his face that he was taking some bold expedient whose\nissue hung in the balance ... Again we touched mud, and the artist's\njoy of achievement shone in his eyes. Backing away, we headed west,\nand for the first time he began to gaze into the fog.\n\n'There's one!' he snapped at last. 'Easy all!'\n\nA boom, one of the usual upright saplings, glided out of the mist. He\ncaught hold of it, and we brought up.\n\n'Rest for three minutes now,' he said. 'We're in fairly good time.'\n\nIt was 11.10. I ate some biscuits and took a nip of whisky while\nDavies prepared for the next stage.\n\nWe had reached the eastern outlet of Memmert Balje, the channel which\nruns east and west behind Juist Island, direct to the south point of\nMemmert. How we had reached it was incomprehensible to me at the\ntime, but the reader will understand by comparing my narrative with\nthe dotted line on the chart. I add this brief explanation, that\nDavies's method had been to cross the channel called the Buse Tief,\nand strike the other side of it at a point well _south_ of the outlet\nof the Memmert Balje (in view of the northward set of the ebb-tide),\nand then to drop back north and feel his way to the outlet. The check\nwas caused by a deep indentation in the Itzendorf Flat; a\n_cul-de-sac,_ with a wide mouth, which Davies was very near mistaking\nfor the Balje itself. We had no time to skirt dents so deep as that;\nhence the dash across its mouth with the chance of missing the upper\nlip altogether, and of either being carried out to sea (for the\nslightest error was cumulative) or straying fruitlessly along the\nedge.\n\nThe next three miles were the most critical of all. They included the\n'watershed', whose length and depth were doubtful; they included,\ntoo, the crux of the whole passage, a spot where the channel forks,\nour own branch continuing west, and another branch diverging from it\nnorth-westward. We must row against time, and yet we must negotiate\nthat crux. Add to this that the current was against us till the\nwatershed was crossed; that the tide was just at its most baffling\nstage, too low to allow us to risk short cuts, and too high to give\ndefinition to the banks of the channel; and that the compass was no\naid whatever for the minor bends. 'Time's up,' said Davies, and on we\nwent. I was hugging the comfortable thought that we should now have\nbooms on our starboard for the whole distance; on our starboard, I\nsay, for experience had taught us that all channels running parallel\nwith the coast and islands were uniformly boomed on the northern\nside. Anyone less confident than Davies would have succumbed to the\ntemptation of slavishly relying on these marks, creeping from one to\nthe other, and wasting precious time. But Davies knew our friend the\n'boom' and his eccentricities too well; and preferred to trust to his\nsense of touch, which no fog in the world could impair. If we\nhappened to sight one, well and good, we should know which side of\nthe channel we were on. But even this contingent advantage he\ndeliberately sacrificed after a short distance, for he crossed over\nto the _south_ or unboomed side and steered and sounded along it,\nusing the ltzendorf Flat as his handrail, so to speak. He was\ncompelled to do this, he told me afterwards, in view of the crux,\nwhere the converging lines of booms would have involved us in\nirremediable confusion. Our branch was the southern one, and it\nfollowed that we must use the southern bank, and defer obtaining any\nhelp from booms until sure we were past that critical spot.\n\nFor an hour we were at the extreme strain, I of physical exertion, he\nof mental. I could not get into a steady swing, for little checks\nwere constant. My right scull was for ever skidding on mud or weeds,\nand the backward suck of shoal water clogged our progress. Once we\nwere both of us out in the slime tugging at the dinghy's sides; then\nin again, blundering on. I found the fog bemusing, lost all idea of\ntime and space, and felt like a senseless marionette kicking and\njerking to a mad music without tune or time. The misty form of Davies\nas he sat with his right arm swinging rhythmically forward and back,\nwas a clockwork figure as mad as myself, but didactic and gibbering\nin his madness. Then the boathook he wielded with a circular sweep\nbegan to take grotesque shapes in my heated fancy; now it was the\nantenna of a groping insect, now the crank of a cripple's\nself-propelled perambulator, now the alpenstock of a lunatic\nmountaineer, who sits in his chair and climbs and climbs to some\nphantom 'watershed'. At the back of such mind as was left me lodged\ntwo insistent thoughts: 'we must hurry on,' 'we are going wrong.' As\nto the latter, take a link-boy through a London fog and you will\nexperience the same thing: he always goes the way you think is wrong.\n'We're rowing _back_!' I remember shouting to Davies once, having\nbecome aware that it was now my left scull which splashed against\nobstructions. 'Rubbish,' said Davies. 'I've crossed over'; and I\nrelapsed.\n\nBy degrees I returned to sanity, thanks to improved conditions. It is\nan ill wind that blows nobody good, and the state of the tide, though\nit threatened us with total failure, had the compensating advantage\nthat the lower it fell the more constricted and defined became our\nchannel; till the time came when the compass and boathook were alike\nunnecessary, because our handrail, the muddy brink of the channel,\nwas visible to the eye, close to us; on our right hand always now,\nfor the crux was far behind, and the northern side was now our guide.\nAll that remained was to press on with might and main ere the bed of\nthe creek dried.\n\nWhat a race it was! Homeric, in effect; a struggle of men with gods,\nfor what were the gods but forces of nature personified? If the God\nof the Falling Tide did not figure in the Olympian circle he is none\nthe less a mighty divinity. Davies left his post, and rowed stroke.\nUnder our united efforts the dinghy advanced in strenuous leaps,\nhurling miniature rollers on the bank beside us. My palms, seasoned\nas they were, were smarting with watery blisters. The pace was too\nhot for my strength and breath.\n\n'I must have a rest,' I gasped.\n\n'Well, I think we're over it,' said Davies.\n\nWe stopped the dinghy dead, and he stabbed over the side with the\nboathook. It passed gently astern of us, and even my bewildered\nbrain took in the meaning of that.\n\n'Three feet and the current with us. _Well_ over it,' he said. 'I'll\npaddle on while you rest and feed.'\n\nIt was a few minutes past one and we still, as he calculated, had\neight miles before us, allowing for bends.\n\n'But it's a mere question of muscle,' he said.\n\nI took his word for it, and munched at tongue and biscuits. As for\nmuscle, we were both in hard condition. He was fresh, and what\ndistress I felt was mainly due to spasmodic exertion culminating in\nthat desperate spurt. As for the fog, it had more than once shown a\nfaint tendency to lift, growing thinner and more luminous, in the\nmanner of fogs, always to settle down again, heavy as a quilt.\n\nNote the spot marked 'second rest' (approximately correct, Davies\nsays) and the course of the channel from that point westward. You\nwill see it broadening and deepening to the dimensions of a great\nriver, and finally merging in the estuary of the Ems. Note, too, that\nits northern boundary, the edge of the now uncovered Nordland Sand,\nleads, with one interruption _(marked A),_ direct to Memmert, and is\nboomed throughout. You will then understand why Davies made so light\nof the rest of his problem. Compared with the feats he had performed,\nit was child's play, for he always had that visible margin to keep\ntouch with if he chose, or to return to in case of doubt. As a matter\nof fact--observe our dotted line--he made two daring departures from\nit, the first purely to save time, the second partly to save time and\npartly to avoid the very awkward spot marked A, where a creek with\nbooms and a little delta of its own interrupts the even bank. During\nthe first of these departures--the shortest but most brilliant--he\nlet me do the rowing, and devoted himself to the niceties of the\ncourse; during the second, and through both the intermediate stages,\nhe rowed himself, with occasional pauses to inspect the chart. We\nfell into a long, measured stroke, and covered the miles rapidly,\nscarcely exchanging a single word till, at the end of a long pull\nthrough vacancy, Davies said suddenly:\n\n'Now where are we to land?'\n\nA sandbank was looming over us crowned by a lonely boom.\n\n'Where are we?'\n\n'A quarter of a mile from Memmert.'\n\n'What time is it?'\n\n'Nearly three.'\n\n\n\n\nXXII. The Quartette\n\n\nHIS _tour de force_ was achieved, and for the moment something like\ncollapse set in.\n\n'What in the world have we come here for?' he muttered; 'I feel a bit\ngiddy.'\n\nI made him drink some whisky, which revived him; and then, speaking\nin whispers, we settled certain points.\n\nI alone was to land. Davies demurred to this out of loyalty, but\ncommon sense, coinciding with a strong aversion of his own, settled\nthe matter. Two were more liable to detection than one. I spoke the\nlanguage well, and if challenged could cover my retreat with a gruff\nword or two; in my woollen overalls, sea-boots, oilskin coat, with a\nsou'-wester pulled well over my eyes, I should pass in a fog for a\nFrisian. Davies must mind the dinghy; but how was I to regain it? I\nhoped to do so without help, by using the edge of the sand; but if he\nheard a long whistle he was to blow the foghorn.\n\n'Take the pocket-compass,' he said. 'Never budge from the shore\nwithout using it, and lay it on the ground for steadiness. Take this\nscrap of chart, too--it may come in useful; but you can't miss the\ndep\u00c3\u00b4t, it looks to be close to the shore. How long will you be'?'\n\n'How long have I got'?'\n\n'The young flood's making--has been for nearly an hour--that bank (he\nmeasured it with his eye) will be covering in an hour and a half.'\n\n'That ought to be enough.'\n\n'Don't run it too fine. It's steep here, but it may shelve farther\non. If you have to wade you'll never find me, and you'll make a deuce\nof a row. Got your watch, matches, knife? No knife? Take mine; never\ngo anywhere without a knife.' (It was his seaman's idea of\nefficiency.)\n\n'Wait a bit, we must settle a place to meet at in case I'm late and\ncan't reach you here.'\n\n'_Don't_ be late. We've got to get back to the yacht before we're\nmissed.'\n\n'But I may have to hide and wait till dark--the fog may clear.'\n\n'We were fools to come, I believe,' said Davies, gloomily. 'There\n_are_ no meeting-places in a place like this. Here's the best I can\nsee on the chart--a big triangular beacon marked on the very point of\nMemmert. You'll pass it.'\n\n'All right. I'm off.'\n\n'Good luck,' said Davies, faintly.\n\nI stepped out, climbed a miry glacis of five or six feet, reached\nhard wet sand, and strode away with the sluggish ripple of the Balje\non my left hand. A curtain dropped between me and Davies, and I was\nalone--alone, but how I thrilled to feel the firm sand rustle under\nmy boots; to know that it led to dry land, where, whatever befell, I\ncould give my wits full play. I clove the fog briskly.\n\nGood Heavens! what was that? I stopped short and listened. From over\nthe water on my left there rang out, dulled by fog, but distinct to\nthe ear, three double strokes on a bell or gong. I looked at my\nwatch.\n\n'Ship at anchor,' I said to myself. 'Six bells in the afternoon\nwatch.' I knew the Balje was here a deep roadstead, where a vessel\nentering the Eastern Ems might very well anchor to ride out a fog.\n\nI was just stepping forward when another sound followed from the same\nquarter, a bugle-call this time. Then I understood--only men-of-war\nsound bugles--the _Blitz_ was here then; and very natural, too, I\nthought, and strode on. The sand was growing drier, the water farther\nbeneath me; then came a thin black ribbon of weed--high-water mark. A\nfew cautious steps to the right and I touched tufts of marram grass.\nIt was Memmert. I pulled out the chart and refreshed my memory. No!\nthere could be no mistake; keep the sea on my left and I must go\nright. I followed the ribbon of weed, keeping it just in view, but\nwalking on the verge of the grass for the sake of silence. All at\nonce I almost tripped over a massive iron bar; others, a rusty\nnetwork of them, grew into being above and around me, like the arms\nof a ghostly polyp.\n\n'What infernal spider's web is this?' I thought, and stumbled clear.\nI had strayed into the base of a gigantic tripod, its gaunt legs\nstayed and cross-stayed, its apex lost in fog; the beacon, I\nremembered. A hundred yards farther and I was down on my knees again,\nlistening with might and main; for several little sounds were in the\nair--voices, the rasp of a boat's keel, the whistling of a tune.\nThese were straight ahead. More to the left, seaward, that is, I had\naural evidence of the presence of a steamboat--a small one, for the\nhiss of escaping steam was low down. On my right front I as yet heard\nnothing, but the dep\u00c3\u00b4t must be there.\n\nI prepared to strike away from my base, and laid the compass on the\nground--NW. roughly I made the course. ('South-east--south-east for\ncoming back,' I repeated inwardly, like a child learning a lesson.)\nThen of my two allies I abandoned one, the beach, and threw myself\nwholly on the fog.\n\n'Play the game,' I said to myself. 'Nobody expects you; nobody will\nrecognize you.'\n\nI advanced in rapid stages of ten yards or so, while grass\ndisappeared and soft sand took its place, pitted everywhere with\nfootmarks. I trod carefully, for obstructions began to show\nthemselves--an anchor, a heap of rusty cable; then a boat bottom\nupwards, and, lying on it, a foul old meerschaum pipe. I paused here\nand strained my ears, for there were sounds in many directions; the\nsame whistling (behind me now), heavy footsteps in front, and\nsomewhere beyond--fifty yards away, I reckoned--a buzz of guttural\nconversation; from the same quarter there drifted to my nostrils the\nacrid odour of coarse tobacco. Then a door banged.\n\nI put the compass in my pocket (thinking 'south-east, south-east'),\nplaced the pipe between my teeth (ugh! the rank savour of it!) rammed\nmy sou'-wester hard down, and slouched on in the direction of the\ndoor that had banged. A voice in front called, 'Karl Schicker'; a\nnearer voice, that of the man whose footsteps I had heard\napproaching, took it up and called 'Karl Schicker': I, too, took it\nup, and, turning my back, called 'Karl Schicker' as gruffly and\ngutturally as I could. The footsteps passed quite close to me, and\nglancing over my shoulder I saw a young man passing, dressed very\nlike me, but wearing a sealskin cap instead of a sou'-wester. As he\nwalked he seemed to be counting coins in his palm. A hail came back\nfrom the beach and the whistling stopped.\n\nI now became aware that I was on a beaten track. These meetings were\nhazardous, so I inclined aside, but not without misgivings, for the\npath led towards the buzz of talk and the banging door, and these\nwere my only guides to the dep\u00c3\u00b4t. Suddenly, and much before I\nexpected it, I knew rather than saw that a wall was in front of me;\nnow it was visible, the side of a low building of corrugated iron. A\npause to reconnoitre was absolutely necessary; but the knot of\ntalkers might have heard my footsteps, and I must at all costs not\nsuggest the groping of a stranger. I lit a match--two--and sucked\nheavily (as I had seen navvies do) at my pipe, studying the trend of\nthe wall by reference to the sounds. There was a stale dottle wedged\nin the bowl, and loathsome fumes resulted. Just then the same door\nbanged again; another name, which I forget, was called out. I decided\nthat I was at the end of a rectangular building which I pictured as\nlike an Aldershot 'hut', and that the door I heard was round the\ncorner to my left. A knot of men must be gathered there, entering it\nby turns. Having expectorated noisily, I followed the tin wall to my\n_right,_ and turning a corner strolled leisurely on, passing signs of\ndomesticity, a washtub, a water-butt, then a tiled approach to an\nopen door. I now was aware of the corner of a second building, also\nof zinc, parallel to the first, but taller, for I could only just see\nthe eave. I was just going to turn off to this as a more promising\nfield for exploration, when I heard a window open ahead of me in my\noriginal building.\n\nI am afraid I am getting obscure, so I append a rough sketch of the\nscene, as I partly saw and chiefly imagined it. It was window (A)\nthat I heard open. From it I could just distinguish through the fog a\nhand protrude, and throw something out--cigar-end? The hand, a clean\none with a gold signet ring, rested for an instant afterwards on the\nsash, and then closed the window.\n\n[Illustration: Sketch--Memmert Salvage Depot.}\n\nMy geography was clear now in one respect. That window belonged to\nthe same room as the banging door (B); for I distinctly heard the\nlatter open and shut again, opposite me on the other side of the\nbuilding. It struck me that it might be interesting to see into that\nroom. 'Play the game,' I reminded myself, and retreated a few yards\nback on tiptoe, then turned and sauntered coolly past the window,\npuffing my villainous pipe and taking a long deliberate look into the\ninterior as I passed--the more deliberate that at the first instant\nI realized that nobody inside was disturbing himself about me. As I\nhad expected (in view of the fog and the time) there was artificial\nlight within. My mental photograph was as follows: a small room with\nvarnished deal walls and furnished like an office; in the far\nright-hand corner a counting-house desk, Grimm sitting at it on a\nhigh stool, side-face to me, counting money; opposite him in an\nawkward attitude a burly fellow in seaman's dress holding a diver's\nhelmet. In the middle of the room a deal table, and on it something\nbig and black. Lolling on chairs near it, their backs to me and their\nfaces turned towards the desk and the diver, two men--von Br\u00c3\u00bcning and\nan older man with a bald yellow head (Dollmann's companion on the\nsteamer, beyond a doubt). On another chair, with its back actually\ntilted against the window, Dollmann.\n\nSuch were the principal features of the scene; for details I had to\nmake another inspection. Stooping low, I crept back, quiet as a cat,\ntill I was beneath the window, and, as I calculated, directly behind\nDollmann's chair. Then with great caution I raised my head. There was\nonly one pair of eyes in the room that I feared in the least, and\nthat was Grimm's, who sat in profile to me, farthest away. I\ninstantly put Dollmann's back between Grimm and me, and then made my\nscrutiny. As I made it, I could feel a cold sweat distilling on my\nforehead and tickling my spine; not from fear or excitement, but from\npure ignominy. For beyond all doubt I was present at the meeting of a\n_bona-fide_ salvage company. It was pay-day, and the directors\nappeared to be taking stock of work done; that was all.\n\nOver the door was an old engraving of a two-decker under full sail;\npinned on the wall a chart and the plan of a ship. Relics of the\nwrecked frigate abounded. On a shelf above the stove was a small\npyramid of encrusted cannon-balls, and supported on nails at odd\nplaces on the walls were corroded old pistols, and what I took to be\nthe remains of a sextant. In a corner of the floor sat a hoary little\ncarronade, carriage and all. None of these things affected me so much\nas a pile of lumber on the floor, not firewood but unmistakable\nwreck-wood, black as bog-oak, still caked in places with the mud of\nages. Nor was it the mere sight of this lumber that dumbfounded me.\nIt was the fact that a fragment of it, a balk of curved timber\ngarnished with some massive bolts, lay on the table, and was\nevidently an object of earnest interest. The diver had turned and was\narguing with gestures over it; von Br\u00c3\u00bcning and Grimm were pressing\nanother view. The diver shook his head frequently, finally shrugged\nhis shoulders, made a salutation, and left the room. Their movements\nhad kept me ducking my head pretty frequently, but I now grew almost\nreckless as to whether I was seen or not. All the weaknesses of my\ntheory crowded on me--the arguments Davies had used at Bensersiel;\nFr\u00c3\u00a4ulein Dollmann's thoughtless talk; the ease (comparatively) with\nwhich I had reached this spot, not a barrier to cross or a lock to\nforce; the publicity of their passage to Memmert by Dollmann, his\nfriend, and Grimm; and now this glimpse of business-like routine. In\na few moments I sank from depth to depth of scepticism. Where were my\nmines, torpedoes, and submarine boats, and where my imperial\nconspirators? Was gold after all at the bottom of this sordid\nmystery? Dollmann after all a commonplace criminal? The ladder of\nproof I had mounted tottered and shook beneath me. 'Don't be a fool,'\nsaid the faint voice of reason. 'There are your four men. Wait.'\n\nTwo more _employ\u00c3\u00a9s_ came into the room in quick succession and\nreceived wages; one looking like a fireman, the other of a superior\ntype, the skipper of a tug, say. There was another discussion with\nthis latter over the balk of wreck-wood, and this man, too, shrugged\nhis shoulders. His departure appeared to end the meeting. Grimm shut\nup a ledger, and I shrank down on my knees, for a general shifting of\nchairs began. At the same time, from the other side of the building,\nI heard my knot of men retreating beachwards, spitting and chatting\nas they went. Presently someone walked across the room towards my\nwindow. I sidled away on all fours, rose and flattened myself erect\nagainst the wall, a sickening despondency on me; my intention to\nslink away south-east as soon as the coast was clear. But the sound\nthat came next pricked me like an electric shock; it was the tinkle\nand scrape of curtain-rings.\n\nQuick as thought I was back in my old position, to find my view\nbarred by a cretonne curtain. It was in one piece, with no chink for\nmy benefit, but it did not hang straight, bulging towards me under\nthe pressure of something--human shoulders by the shape. Dollmann, I\nconcluded, was still in his old place. I now was exasperated to find\nthat I could scarcely hear a word that was said, not even by pressing\nmy ear against the glass. It was not that the speakers were of set\npurpose hushing their voices--they used an ordinary tone for intimate\ndiscussion--but the glass and curtain deadened the actual words.\nStill, I was soon able to distinguish general characteristics. Von\nBr\u00c3\u00bcning's voice--the only one I had ever heard before--I recognized\nat once; he was on the left of the table, and Dollmann's I knew from\nhis position. The third was a harsh croak, belonging to the old\ngentleman whom, for convenience, I shall prematurely begin to call\nHerr B\u00c3\u00b6hme. It was too old a voice to be Grimm's; besides, it had the\nring of authority, and was dealing at the moment in sharp\ninterrogations. Three of its sentences I caught in their entirety.\n'When was that?' 'They went no farther?' and 'Too long; out of the\nquestion.' Dollmann's voice, though nearest to me, was the least\naudible of all. It was a dogged monotone, and what was that odd\nmovement of the curtain at his back? Yes, his hands were behind him\nclutching and kneading a fold of the cretonne. 'You are feeling\nuncomfortable, my friend,' was my comment. Suddenly he threw back his\nhead--I saw the dent of it--and spoke up so that I could not miss a\nword. 'Very well, sir, you shall see them at supper to-night; I will\nask them both.'\n\n(You will not be surprised to learn that I instantly looked at my\nwatch--though it takes long to write what I have described--but the\ntime was only a quarter to four.) He added something about the fog,\nand his chair creaked. Ducking promptly I heard the curtain-rings\njar, and: 'Thick as ever.'\n\n'Your report, Herr Dollmann,' said B\u00c3\u00b6hme, curtly. Dollmann left the\nwindow and moved his chair up to the table; the other two drew in\ntheirs and settled themselves.\n\n'_Chatham,_' said Dollmann, as if announcing a heading. It was an easy\nword to catch, rapped out sharp, and you can imagine how it startled\nme. 'That's where you've been for the last month!' I said to myself.\nA map crackled and I knew they were bending over it, while Dollmann\nexplained something. But now my exasperation became acute, for not a\nsyllable more reached me. Squatting back on my heels, I cast about\nfor expedients. Should I steal round and try the door? Too dangerous.\nClimb to the roof and listen down the stove-pipe? Too noisy, and\ngenerally hopeless. I tried for a downward purchase on the upper half\nof the window, which was of the simple sort in two sections, working\nvertically. No use; it resisted gentle pressure, would start with a\nsudden jar if I forced it. I pulled out Davies's knife and worked the\npoint of the blade between sash and frame to give it play--no result;\nbut the knife was a nautical one, with a marlin-spike as well as a\nbig blade.\n\nJust now the door within opened and shut again, and I heard steps\napproaching round the corner to my right. I had the presence of mind\nnot to lose a moment, but moved silently away (blessing the deep\nFrisian sand) round the corner of the big parallel building. Someone\nwhom I could not see walked past till his boots clattered on tiles,\nnext resounded on boards. 'Grimm in his living-room,' I inferred. The\nprecious minutes ebbed away--five, ten, fifteen. Had he gone for\ngood? I dared not return otherwise. Eighteen--he was coming out! This\ntime I stole forward boldly when the man had just passed, dimly saw a\nfigure, and clearly enough the glint of a white paper he was holding.\nHe made his circuit and re-entered the room.\n\nHere I felt and conquered a relapse to scepticism. 'If this is an\nimportant conclave why don't they set guards?' Answer, the only\npossible one, 'Because they stand alone. Their _employ\u00c3\u00a9s,_ like\n_everyone_ we had met hitherto, know nothing. The real object of this\nsalvage company (a poor speculation, I opined) is solely to afford a\npretext for the conclave.' 'Why the curtain, even?' 'Because there\nare maps, stupid!'\n\nI was back again at the window, but as impotent as ever against that\neven stream of low confidential talk. But I would not give up. Fate\nand the fog had brought me here, the one solitary soul perhaps who by\nthe chain of circumstances had both the will and the opportunity to\nwrest their secret from these four men.\n\nThe marlin-spike! Where the lower half of the window met the sill it\nsank into a shallow groove. I thrust the point of the spike down into\nthe interstice between sash and frame and heaved with a slowly\nincreasing force, which I could regulate to the fraction of an ounce,\non this powerful lever. The sash gave, with the faintest possible\nprotest, and by imperceptible degrees I lifted it to the top of the\ngroove, and the least bit above it, say half an inch in all; but it\nmade an appreciable difference to the sounds within, as when you\nremove your foot from a piano's soft pedal. I could do no more, for\nthere was no further fulcrum for the spike, and I dared not gamble\naway what I had won by using my hands.\n\nHope sank again when I placed my cheek on the damp sill, and my ear\nto the chink. My men were close round the table referring to papers\nwhich I heard rustle. Dollmann's 'report' was evidently over, and I\nrarely heard his voice; Grimm's occasionally, von Br\u00c3\u00bcning's and\nB\u00c3\u00b6hme's frequently; but, as before, it was the latter only that I\ncould ever count on for an intelligible word. For, unfortunately, the\nvillains of the piece plotted without any regard to dramatic fitness\nor to my interests. Immersed in a subject with which they were all\nfamiliar, they were allusive, elliptic, and persistently technical.\nMany of the words I did catch were unknown to me. The rest were, for\nthe most part, either letters of the alphabet or statistical figures,\nof depth, distance, and, once or twice, of time. The letters of the\nalphabet recurred often, and seemed, as far as I could make out, to\nrepresent the key to the cipher. The numbers clustering round them\nwere mostly very small, with decimals. What maddened me most was the\nscarcity of plain nouns.\n\nTo report what I heard to the reader would be impossible; so chaotic\nwas most of it that it left no impression on my own memory. All I can\ndo is to tell him what fragments stuck, and what nebulous\nclassification I involved. The letters ran from A to G, and my best\ncontinuous chance came when B\u00c3\u00b6hme, reading rapidly from a paper, I\nthink, went through the letters, backwards, from G, adding remarks to\neach; thus: 'G. . . completed.' 'F. . . bad. . . 1.3 (metres?). . .2.5\n(kilometres?).' 'E . . . thirty-two. . . 1.2.' 'D. . . 3 weeks. . .\nthirty.' 'C. . .' and so on.\n\nAnother time he went through this list again, only naming each letter\nhimself, and receiving laconic answers from Grimm--answers which seemed\nto be numbers, but I could not be sure. For minutes together I caught\nnothing but the scratching of pens and inarticulate mutterings. But out\nof the muck-heap I picked five pearls--four sibilant nouns and a name\nthat I knew before. The nouns were 'Schleppboote' (tugs); 'Wassertiefe'\n(depth of water); 'Eisenbahn' (railway); 'Lotsen' (pilots). The name,\nalso sibilant and thus easier to hear, was 'Esens'.\n\nTwo or three times I had to stand back and ease my cramped neck, and\non each occasion I looked at my watch, for I was listening against\ntime, just as we had rowed against time. We were going to be asked to\nsupper, and must be back aboard the yacht in time to receive the\ninvitation. The fog still brooded heavily and the light, always bad,\nwas growing worse. How would _they_ get back? How had they come from\nJuist? Could we forestall them? Questions of time, tide,\ndistance--just the odious sort of sums I was unfit to cope with--were\ndistracting my attention when it should have been wholly elsewhere.\n4.20--4.25--now it was past 4.30 when Davies said the bank would\ncover. I should have to make for the beacon; but it was fatally near\nthat steamboat path, etc., and I still at intervals heard voices from\nthere. It must have been about 4.35 when there was another shifting\nof chairs within. Then someone rose, collected papers, and went out;\nsomeone else, _without_ rising (therefore Grimm), followed him.\n\nThere was silence in the room for a minute, and after that, for the\nfirst time, I heard some plain colloquial German, with no\naccompaniment of scratching or rustling. 'I must wait for this,' I\nthought, and waited.\n\n'He insists on coming,' said B\u00c3\u00b6hme.\n\n'Ach!' (an ejaculation of surprise and protest from von Br\u00c3\u00bcning).\n\n'I said the _25th_.'\n\n'Why?'\n\n'The tide serves well. The night-train, of course. Tell Grimm to be\nready----' (An inaudible question from von Br\u00c3\u00bcning.)\n\n'No, any weather.' A laugh from von Br\u00c3\u00bcning and some words I could not\ncatch.\n\n'Only one, with half a load.'\n\n'. . .meet?'\n\n'At the station.'\n\n'So--how's the fog?'\n\nThis appeared to be really the end. Both men rose and steps came\ntowards the window. I leapt aside as I heard it thrown up, and\ncovered by the noise backed into safety. Von Br\u00c3\u00bcning called 'Grimm!'\nand that, and the open window, decided me that my line of advance was\nnow too dangerous to retreat by. The only alternative was to make a\ncircuit round the bigger of the two buildings--and an interminable\ncircuit it seemed--and all the while I knew my compass-course\n'south-east' was growing nugatory. I passed a padlocked door, two\ncorners, and faced the void of fog. Out came the compass, and I\nsteadied myself for the sum. 'South-east before--I'm farther to the\neastward now--east will about do'; and off I went, with an error of\nfour whole points, over tussocks and deep sand. The beach seemed much\nfarther off than I had thought, and I began to get alarmed, puzzled\nover the compass several times, and finally realized that I had lost\nmy way. I had the sense not to make matters worse by trying to find\nit again, and, as the lesser of two evils, blew my whistle, softly at\nfirst, then louder. The bray of a foghorn sounded right _behind_ me.\nI whistled again and then ran for my life, the horn sounding at\nintervals. In three or four minutes I was on the beach and in the\ndinghy.\n\n\n\n\nXXIII. A Change of Tactics\n\n\nWE pushed off without a word, and paddled out of sight of the beach.\nA voice was approaching, hailing us. 'Hail back,' whispered Davies;\n'pretend we're a galliot.'\n\n'Ho-a,' I shouted, 'where am I?'\n\n'Off Memmert,' came back. 'Where are you bound?'\n\n'Delfzyl,' whispered Davies.\n\n'Delf-zyl,' I bawled.\n\nA sentence ending with 'anchor' was returned.\n\n'The flood's tearing east,' whispered Davies; 'sit still.'\n\nWe heard no more, and, after a few minutes' drifting, 'What luck?'\nsaid Davies.\n\n'One or two clues, and an invitation to supper.'\n\nThe clues I left till later; the invitation was the thing, and I\nexplained its urgency.\n\n'How will _they_ get back?' said Davies; 'if the fog lasts the\nsteamer's sure to be late.'\n\n'We can count for nothing,' I answered. 'There was some little\nsteamboat off the dep\u00c3\u00b4t, and the fog may lift. Which is our quickest\nway?'\n\n'At this tide, a bee-line to Norderney by compass; we shall have\nwater over all the banks.'\n\nHe had all his preparations made, the lamp lit in advance, the\ncompass in position, and we started at once; he at the bow-oar where\nhe had better control over the boat's nose; lamp and compass on the\nfloor between us. Twilight thickened into darkness--a choking, pasty\ndarkness--and still we sped unfalteringly over that trackless waste,\nsitting and swinging in our little pool of stifled orange light. To\ndrown fatigue and suspense I conned over my clues, and tried to carve\ninto my memory every fugitive word I had overheard.\n\n'What are there seven of round here?' I called back to Davies once\n(thinking of A to G). 'Sorry,' I added, for no answer came.\n\n'I see a star,' was my next word, after a long interval. 'Now it's\ngone. There it is again! Right aft!'\n\n'That's Borkum light,' said Davies, presently; 'the fog's lifting.' A\nkeen wind from the west struck our faces, and as swiftly as it had\ncome the fog rolled away from us, in one mighty mass, stripping clean\nand pure the starry dome of heaven, still bright with the western\nafter-glow, and beginning to redden in the east to the rising moon.\nNorderney light was flashing ahead, and Davies could take his tired\neyes from the pool of light.\n\n'Damn!' was all he uttered in the way of gratitude for this mercy,\nand I felt very much the same; for in a fog Davies in a dinghy was a\nmatch for a steamer; in a clear he lost his handicap.\n\nIt was a quarter to seven. 'An hour'll do it, if we buck up,' he\npronounced, after taking a rough bearing with the two lights. He\npointed out a star to me, which we were to keep exactly astern, and\nagain I applied to their labour my aching back and smarting palms.\n\n'What did you say about seven of something?' said Davies.\n\n'What are there seven of hereabouts?'\n\n'Islands, of course,' said Davies. 'Is that the clue?'\n\n'Maybe.'\n\nThen followed the most singular of all our confabulations. Two\nmemories are better than one, and the sooner I carved the cipher into\nhis memory as well as mine the better record we should have. So, with\nrigid economy of breath, I snapped out all my story, and answered his\nbreathless questions. It saved me from being mesmerized by the star,\nand both of us from the consciousness of over-fatigue.\n\n'Spying at Chatham, the blackguard?' he hissed.\n\n'What do you make of it?' I asked.\n\n'Nothing about battleships, mines, forts?' he said.\n\n'No.'\n\n'Nothing about the Ems, Emden, Wilhelmshaven?'\n\n'No.'\n\n'Nothing about transports?'\n\n'No.'\n\n'I believe--I was right--after all--something to do--with the\nchannels--behind islands.'\n\nAnd so that outworn creed took a new lease of life; though for my\npart the words that clashed with it were those that had sunk the\ndeepest.\n\n'Esens,' I protested; 'that town behind Bensersiel.'\n\n'Wassertiefe, Lotsen, Schleppboote,' spluttered Davies.\n\n'Kilometre--Eisenbahn,' from me, and so on.\n\nI should earn the just execration of the reader if I continued to\nreport such a dialogue. Suffice to say that we realized very soon\nthat the substance of the plot was still a riddle. On the other hand,\nthere was fresh scent, abundance of it; and the question was already\ntaking shape--were we to follow it up or revert to last night's\ndecision and strike with what weapons we had? It was a pressing\nquestion, too, the last of many--was there to be no end to the\nemergencies of this crowded day?--pressing for reasons I could not\ndefine, while convinced that we must be ready with an answer by\nsupper-time to-night.\n\nMeantime, we were nearing Norderney; the See Gat was crossed, and\nwith the last of the flood tide fair beneath us, and the red light on\nthe west pier burning ahead, we began insensibly to relax our\nefforts. But I dared not rest, for I was at that point of exhaustion\nwhen mechanical movement was my only hope.\n\n'Light astern,' I said, thickly. 'Two--white and red.'\n\n'Steamer,' said Davies; 'going south though.'\n\n'Three now.'\n\nA neat triangle of gems--topaz, ruby, and emerald--hung steady behind\nus.\n\n'Turned east,' said Davies. 'Buck up--steamer from Juist. No, by\nJove! too small. What is it?'\n\nOn we laboured, while the gems waxed in brilliancy as the steamer\noverhauled us.\n\n'Easy,' said Davies, 'I seem to know those lights--the _Blitz_'s\nlaunch--don't let's be caught rowing like madmen in a muck sweat.\nPaddle inshore a bit.' He was right, and, as in a dream, I saw\nhurrying and palpitating up the same little pinnace that had towed us\nout of Bensersiel.\n\n'We're done for now,' I remember thinking, for the guilt of the\nrunaway was strong in me; and an old remark of von Br\u00c3\u00bcning's about\n'police' was in my ears. But she was level with and past us before I\ncould sink far into despair.\n\n'Three of them behind the hood,' said Davies: 'what are we to do?'\n\n'Follow,' I answered, and essayed a feeble stroke, but the blade\nscuttered over the surface.\n\n'Let's wait about for a bit,' said Davies. 'We're late anyhow. If\nthey go to the yacht they'll think we're ashore.'\n\n'Our shore clothes--lying about.'\n\n'Are you up to talking?'\n\n'No; but we must. The least suspicion'll do for us now.'\n\n'Give me your scull, old chap, and put on your coat.'\n\nHe extinguished the lantern, lit a pipe, and then rowed slowly on,\nwhile I sat on a slack heap in the stern and devoted my last\nresources of will to the emancipation of the spirit from the tired\nflesh.\n\nIn ten minutes or so we were rounding the pier, and there was the\nyacht's top-mast against the sky. I saw, too, that the launch was\nalongside of her, and told Davies so. Then I lit a cigarette, and\nmade a lamentable effort to whistle. Davies followed suit, and\nemitted a strange melody which I took to be 'Home, Sweet Home,' but\nhe has not the slightest ear for music.\n\n'Why, they're on board, I believe,' said I; 'the cabin's lighted.\nAhoy there!' I shouted as we came up. 'Who's that?'\n\n'Good evening, sir,' said a sailor, who was fending off the yacht\nwith a boathook. 'It's Commander von Br\u00c3\u00bcning's launch. I think the\ngentlemen want to see you.'\n\nBefore we could answer, an exclamation of: 'Why, here they are!' came\nfrom the deck of the _Dulcibella_, and the dim form of von Br\u00c3\u00bcning himself\nsemerged from the companionway. There was something of a scuffle\ndown below, which the Commander nearly succeeded in drowning by the\nbreeziness of his greeting. Meanwhile, the ladder creaked under fresh\nweight, and Dollmann appeared.\n\n'Is that you, Herr Davies?' he said.\n\n'Hullo! Herr Dollmann,' said Davies; 'how are you?'\n\nI must explain that we had floated up between the yacht and the\nlaunch, whose sailors had passed her a little aside in order to give\nus room. Her starboard side-light was just behind and above us,\npouring its green rays obliquely over the deck of the _Dulcibella_,\nwhile we and the dinghy were in deep shadow between. The most studied\ncalculation could not have secured us more favourable conditions for\na moment which I had always dreaded--the meeting of Davies and\nDollmann. The former, having shortened his sculls, just sat where he\nwas, half turned towards the yacht and looking up at his enemy. No\nlineament of his own face could have been visible to the latter,\nwhile those pitiless green rays--you know their ravaging effect on\nthe human physiognomy--struck full on Dollmann's face. It was my\nfirst fair view of it at close quarters, and, secure in my background\nof gloom, I feasted with a luxury of superstitious abhorrence on the\nlivid smiling mask that for a few moments stooped peering down\ntowards Davies. One of the caprices of the crude light was to\nobliterate, or at any rate so penetrate, beard and moustache, as to\nreveal in outline lips and chin, the features in which defects of\ncharacter are most surely betrayed, especially when your victim\nsmiles. Accuse me, if you will, of stooping to melodramatic\nembroidery; object that my own prejudiced fancy contributed to the\nresult; but I can, nevertheless, never efface the impression of\nmalignant perfidy and base passion, exaggerated to caricature, that\nI received in those few instants. Another caprice of the light was to\nidentify the man with the portrait of him when younger and\nclean-shaven, in the frontispiece of his own book; and another still,\nthe most repulsively whimsical of all, was to call forth a strong\nresemblance to the sweet young girl who had been with us yesterday.\n\nEnough! I shall never offend again in this way. In reality I am much\nmore inclined to laugh than shudder over this meeting; for meanwhile\nthe third of our self-invited guests had with stertorous puffing\nrisen to the stage, for all the world like a demon out of a\ntrapdoor, specially when he entered the zone of that unearthly\nlight. And there they stood in a row, like delinquents at judgement,\nwhile we, the true culprits, had only passively to accept\nexplanations. Of course these were plausible enough. Dollmann having\nseen the yacht in port that morning had called on his return from\nMemmert to ask us to supper. Finding no one aboard, and concluding we\nwere ashore, he had meant to leave a note for Davies in the cabin.\nHis friend, Herr B\u00c3\u00b6hme, _'the distinguished engineer,'_ was anxious\nto see over the little vessel that had come so far, and he knew that\nDavies would not mind the intrusion. Not at all, said Davies; would\nnot they stop and have drinks? No, but would we come to supper at\nDollmann's villa? With pleasure, said Davies, but we had to change\nfirst. Up to this point we had been masters of the situation; but\nhere von Br\u00c3\u00bcning, who alone of the three appeared to be entirely at\nhis ease, made the _retour offensif_.\n\n'Where have you been?' he asked.\n\n'Oh, rowing about since the fog cleared,' said Davies.\n\nI suppose he thought that evasion would pass muster, but as he spoke,\nI noticed to my horror that a stray beam of light was playing on the\nbunch of white cotton-waste that adorned one of the rowlocks: for we\nhad forgotten to remove these tell-tale appendages. So I added:\n\n'After ducks again'; and, lifting one of the guns, let the light\nflash on its barrel. To my own ears my voice sounded husky and\ndistant.\n\n'Always ducks,' laughed von Br\u00c3\u00bcning. 'No luck, I suppose?'\n\n'No,' said Davies; 'but it ought to be a good time after sunset----'\n\n'What, with a rising tide and the banks covered?'\n\n'We saw some,' said Davies, sullenly.\n\n'I tell you what, my zealous young sportsmen, you're rash to leave\nyour boat at anchor here after dark without a light. I came aboard to\nfind your lamp and set it.'\n\n'Oh, thanks,' said Davies; 'we took it with us.'\n\n'To see to shoot by?'\n\nWe laughed uncomfortably, and Davies compassed a wonderful German\nphrase to the effect that 'it might come in useful'. Happily the\nmatter went no farther, for the position was a strained one at the\nbest, and would not bear lengthening. The launch went alongside, and\nthe invaders evacuated British soil, looking, for all von Br\u00c3\u00bcning's\nflippant nonchalance, a rather crestfallen party. So much so, that,\nacute as was my anxiety, I took courage to whisper to Davies, while\nthe transhipment of Herr B\u00c3\u00b6hme was proceeding: 'Ask Dollmann to stay\nwhile we dress.'\n\n'Why?' he whispered.\n\n'Go on.'\n\n'I say, Herr Dollmann,' said Davies, 'won't you stay on board with us\nwhile we dress? There's a lot to tell you, and--and we can follow on\nwith you when we're ready.'\n\nDollmann had not yet stepped into the launch. 'With pleasure,' he\nsaid; but there followed an ominous silence, broken by von Br\u00c3\u00bcning.\n\n'Oh, come along, Dollmann, and let them alone,' he said brusquely.\n'You'll be horribly in the way down there, and we shall never get any\nsupper if you keep them yarning.'\n\n'And it's now a quarter-past eight o'clock,' grumbled Herr B\u00c3\u00b6hme from\nhis corner behind the hood. Dollmann submitted, and excused himself,\nand the launch steamed away.\n\n'I think I twig,' said Davies, as he helped, almost hoisted, me\naboard. 'Rather risky though--eh?'\n\n'I knew they'd object--only wanted to make sure.'\n\nThe cabin was just as we had left it, our shore clothes lying in\ndisorder on the bunks, a locker or two half open.\n\n'Well, I wonder what they did down here,' said Davies.\n\nFor my part I went straight to the bookshelf.\n\n'Does anything strike you about this?' I asked, kneeling on the sofa.\n\n'Logbook's shifted,' said Davies. 'I'll swear it was at the end\nbefore.'\n\n'That doesn't matter. Anything else?'\n\n'By Jove!--where's Dollmann's book?'\n\n'It's here all right, but not where it should be.' I had been reading\nit, you remember, overnight, and in the morning had replaced it in\nfull view among the other books. I now found it behind them, in a\nwrenched attitude, which showed that someone who had no time to spare\nhad pushed it roughly inwards.\n\n'What do you make of that?' said Davies.\n\nHe produced long drinks, and we allowed ourselves ten minutes of\nabsolute rest, stretched at full length on the sofas.\n\n'They don't trust Dollmann,' I said. 'I spotted that at Memmert\neven.'\n\n'How?'\n\n'First, when they were talking about you and me. He was on his\ndefence, and in a deuce of a funk, too. B\u00c3\u00b6hme was pressing him hard.\nAgain, at the end, when he left the room followed by Grimm, who I'm\ncertain was sent to watch him. It was while he was away that the\nother two arranged that rendezvous for the night of the _25th._ And\nagain just now, when you asked him to stay. I believe it's working\nout as I thought it would. Von Br\u00c3\u00bcning, and through him B\u00c3\u00b6hme (who is\nthe 'engineer from Bremen'), know the story of that short cut and\nsuspect that it was an attempt on your life. Dollmann daren't confess\nto that, because, morality apart, it could only have been prompted by\nextreme necessity--that is, by the knowledge that you were really\ndangerous, and not merely an inquisitive stranger. Now _we_ know his\nmotive; but they don't yet. The position of that book proves it.'\n\n'He shoved it in?'\n\n'To prevent them seeing it. There's no earthly reason why _they_\nshould have hidden it.'\n\n'Then we're getting on,' said Davies. 'That shows they know his real\nname, or why should he shove the book in? But they don't know he\nwrote a book, and that I have a copy.'\n\n'At any rate he _thinks_ they don't; we can't say more than that.'\n\n'And what does he think about me--and you?'\n\n'That's the point. Ten to one he's in tortures of doubt, and would\ngive a fortune to have five minutes' talk alone with you to see how\nthe land lies and get your version of the short cut incident. But\nthey won't let him. They want to watch him in our company and us in\nhis; you see it's an interesting reunion for you and him.'\n\n'Well, let's get into these beastly clothes for it,' groaned Davis.\n'I shall have a plunge overboard.'\n\nSomething drastic was required, and I followed his example, curious\nas the hour was for bathing.\n\n'I believe I know what happened just now,' said I, as we plied rough\ntowels in the warmth below. 'They steamed up and found nobody on\nboard. \"I'll leave a note,\" says Dollmann. \"No independent\ncommunications,\" say they (or think they), \"we'll come too, and take\nthe chance of inspecting this hornets' nest.\" Down they go, and\nDollmann, who knows what to look for first, sees that damning bit of\nevidence staring him in the face. They look casually at the shelf\namong other things--examine the logbook, say--and he manages to push\nhis own book out of sight. But he couldn't replace it when the\ninterruption came. The action would have attracted attention _then,_\nand B\u00c3\u00b6hme made him leave the cabin in advance, you know.'\n\n'This is all very well,' said Davies, pausing in his toilet, 'but do\nthey guess how we've spent the day? By Jove, Carruthers, that chart\nwith the square cut out; there it is on the rack!'\n\n'We must chance it, and bluff for all we're worth,' I said. The fact\nwas that Davies could not be brought to realize that he had done\nanything very remarkable that day; yet those fourteen sinuous miles\ntraversed blindfold, to say nothing of the return journey and my own\nexploits, made up an achievement audacious and improbable enough to\nout-distance suspicion. Nevertheless, von Br\u00c3\u00bcning's banter had been\ndisquieting, and if an inkling of our expedition had crossed his mind\nor theirs, there were ways of testing us which it would require all\nour effrontery to defeat.\n\n'What are you looking for?' said Davies. I was at the collar and stud\nstage, but had broken off to study the time-table which we had bought\nthat morning.\n\n'Somebody insists on coming by the night train to somewhere, on the\n_25th_,' I reminded him. 'B\u00c3\u00b6hme, von Br\u00c3\u00bcning, and Grimm are to meet\nthe Somebody.'\n\n'Where?'\n\n'At a railway station! I don't know where. They seemed to take it for\ngranted. But it must be somewhere on the sea, because B\u00c3\u00b6hme said,\n\"the tide serves.\"'\n\n'It may be anywhere from Emden to Hamburg.' _[See Map B]_\n\n'No, there's a limit; it's probably somewhere near. Grimm was to\ncome, and he's at Memmert.'\n\n'Here's the map... Emden and Norddeich are the only coast stations\ntill you get to Wilhelmshaven--no, to Carolinensiel; but those are a\nlong way east.'\n\n'And Emden's a long way south. Say Norddeich then; but according to\nthis there's no train there after _6.15_ p.m.; that's hardly \"night\".\nWhen's high tide on the 25th?'\n\n'Let's see--8.30 here to-night--Norddeich'll be the same. Somewhere\nbetween 10.30 and 11 on the 25th.'\n\n'There's a train at Emden at 9.22 from Leer and the south, and one at\n10.50 from the north.'\n\n'Are you counting on another fog?' said Davies, mockingly.\n\n'No; but I want to know what our plans are.'\n\n'Can't we wait till this cursed inspection's over?'\n\n'No, we can't; we should come to grief.' This was no barren truism,\nfor I was ready with a plan of my own, though reluctant to broach it\nto Davies.\n\nMeanwhile, ready or not, we had to start. The cabin we left as it\nwas, changing nothing and hiding nothing; the safest course to take,\nwe thought, in spite of the risk of further search. But, as usual, I\ntransferred my diary to my breast-pocket, and made sure that the two\nofficial letters from England were safe in a compartment of it.\n\n'What do you propose?' I asked, when we were in the dinghy again.\n\n'It's a case of \"as you were\",' said Davies. 'To-day's trip was a\nchance we shall never get again. We must go back to last night's\ndecision--tell them that we're going to stay on here for a bit.\nShooting, I suppose we shall have to say.'\n\n'And courting?' I suggested.\n\n'Well, they know all about that. And then we must watch for a chance\nof tackling Dollmann privately. Not to-night, because we want time to\nconsider those clues of yours.'\n\n'\"Consider\"?' I said: 'that's putting it mildly.'\n\nWe were at the ladder, and what a languid stiffness oppressed me I\ndid not know till I touched its freezing rungs, each one of which\nseared my sore palms like red-hot iron.\n\nThe overdue steamer was just arriving as we set foot on the quay.\n'And yet, by Jove! why not to-night?' pursued Davies, beginning to\nstride up the pier at a pace I could not imitate.\n\n'Steady on,' I protested; 'and, look here, I disagree altogether. I\nbelieve to-day has doubled our chances, but unless we alter our\ntactics it has doubled our risks. We've involved ourselves in too\ntangled a web. I don't like this inspection, and I fear that foxy old\nB\u00c3\u00b6hme who prompted it. The mere fact of their inviting us shows that\nwe stand badly; for it runs in the teeth of Br\u00c3\u00bcning's warning at\nBensersiel, and smells uncommonly like arrest. There's a rift between\nDollmann and the others, but it's a ticklish matter to drive our\nwedge in; as to _to-night,_ hopeless; they're on the watch, and won't\ngive us a chance. And after all, do we know enough? We don't know why\nhe fled from England and turned German. It may have been an\nextraditable crime, but it may not. Supposing he defies us? There's\nthe girl, you see--she ties our hands, and if he once gets wind of\nthat, and trades on our weakness, the game's up.'\n\n'What are you driving at?'\n\n'We want to detach him from Germany, but he'll probably go to any\nlengths rather than abandon his position here. His attempt on you is\nthe measure of his interest in it. Now, is to-day to be wasted?' We\nwere passing through the public gardens, and I dropped on to a seat\nfor a moment's rest, crackling dead leaves under me. Davies remained\nstanding, and pecked at the gravel with his toe.\n\n'We have got two valuable clues,' I went on; 'that rendezvous on the\n25th is one, and the name Esens is the other. We may consider them to\neternity; I vote we act on them.'\n\n'How?' said Davies. 'We're under a searchlight here; and if we're\ncaught----'\n\n'Your plan--ugh!--it's as risky as mine, and more so,' I replied,\nrising with a jerk, for a spasm of cramp took me. 'We must separate,'\nI added, as we walked on. 'We want, at one stroke, to prove to them\nthat we're harmless, and to get a fresh start. I go back to London.'\n\n'To London!' said Davies. We were passing under an arc lamp, and, for\nthe dismay his face showed, I might have said Kamchatka.\n\n'Well, after all, it's where I ought to be at this moment,' I\nobserved.\n\n'Yes, I forgot. And me?'\n\n'You can't get on without me, so you lay up the yacht here--taking\nyour time.'\n\n'While you?'\n\n'After making inquiries about Dollmann's past I double back as\nsomebody else, and follow up the clues.'\n\n'You'll have to be quick,' said Davies, abstractedly.\n\n'I can just do it in time for the 25th.'\n\n'When you say \"making inquiries\",' he continued, looking straight\nbefore him, 'I hope you don't mean setting other people on his\ntrack?'\n\n'He's fair game!' I could not help saying; for there were moments\nwhen I chafed under this scrupulous fidelity to our self-denying\nordinance.\n\n'He's our game, or nobody's,' said Davies, sharply.\n\n'Oh, I'll keep the secret,' I rejoined.\n\n'Let's stick together,' he broke out. 'I shall make a muck of it\nwithout you. And how are we to communicate--meet?'\n\n'Somehow--that can wait. I know it's a leap in the dark, but there's\nsafety in darkness.'\n\n'Carruthers! what are we talking about? If they have the ghost of a\nnotion where we have been to-day, you give us away by packing off to\nLondon. They'll think we know their secret and are clearing out to\nmake use of it. _That_ means arrest, if you like!'\n\n'Pessimist! Haven't I written proof of good faith in my\npocket--official letters of recall, received to-day? It's one\ndeception the less, you see; for those letters _may_ have been\nopened; skilfully done it's impossible to detect. When in doubt, tell\nthe truth!'\n\n'It's a rum thing how often it pays in this spying business,' said\nDavies thoughtfully.\n\nWe had been tramping through deserted streets under the glare of\nelectricity, I with my leaden shuffle, he with the purposeful forward\nstoop and swinging arms that always marked his gait ashore.\n\n'Well, what's it to be?' I said. 'Here's the Schwannall\u00c3\u00a9e.'\n\n'I don't like it,' said he; 'but I trust your judgement.'\n\nWe turned slowly down, running over a few last points where prior\nagreement was essential. As we stood at the very gate of the villa:\n'Don't commit yourself to dates,' I said; 'say nothing that will\nprevent you from being here at least a week hence with the yacht\nstill afloat.' And my final word, as we waited at the door for the\nbell to be answered, was: 'Don't mind what _I_ say. If things look\nqueer we may have to lighten the ship.'\n\n'Lighten?' whispered Davies; 'oh, I hope I shan't bosh it.'\n\n'I hope I shan't get cramp,' I muttered between my teeth.\n\nIt will be remembered that Davies had never been to the villa before.\n\n\n\n\nXXIV. Finesse\n\n\nTHE door of a room on the ground floor was opened to us by a\nman-servant. As we entered the rattle of a piano stopped, and a hot\nwave of mingled scent and cigar-smoke struck my nostrils. The first\nthing I noticed over Davies's shoulder, as he preceded me into the\nroom, was a woman--the source of the perfume I decided--turning\nround from the piano as he passed it and staring him up and down with\na disdainful familiarity that I at once hotly resented. She was in\nevening dress, pronounced in cut and colour; had a certain exuberant\nbeauty, not wholly ascribable to nature, and a notable lack of\nbreeding. Another glance showed me Dollmann putting down a liqueur\nglass of brandy, and rising from a low chair with something of a\nstart; and another, von Br\u00c3\u00bcning, lying back in a corner of a sofa,\nsmoking; on the same sofa, _vis-\u00c3\u00a0-vis_ to him, was--yes, of course it\nwas--Clara Dollmann; but how their surroundings alter people, I\ncaught myself thinking. For the rest, I was aware that the room was\nfurnished with ostentation, and was stuffy with stove-engendered\nwarmth. Davies steered a straight course for Dollmann, and shook his\nhand with businesslike resolution. Then he tacked across to the sofa,\nabandoning me in the face of the enemy.\n\n'Mr----?' said Dollmann.\n\n'Carruthers,' I answered, distinctly. 'I was with Davies in the boat\njust now, but I don't think he introduced me. And now he has\nforgotten again,' I added, dryly, turning towards Davies, who, having\npresented himself to Fr\u00c3\u00a4ulein Dollmann, was looking feebly from her\nto von Br\u00c3\u00bcning, the picture of tongue-tied awkwardness. (The\nCommander nodded to me and stretched himself with a yawn.)\n\n'Von Br\u00c3\u00bcning told me about you,' said Dollmann, ignoring my allusion,\n'but I was not quite sure of the name. No; it was not an occasion for\nformalities, was it?' He gave a sudden, mirthless laugh. I thought\nhim flushed and excitable; yet, seen in a normal light, he was in\nsome respects a pleasant surprise, the remarkable conformation of the\nhead giving an impression of intellectual power and restless, almost\ninsanely restless, energy.\n\n'What need?' I said. 'I have heard so much about you from Davies--and\nCommander von Br\u00c3\u00bcning--that we seem to be old friends already.'\n\nHe shot a doubtful look at me, and a diversion came from the piano.\n\n'And now, for Heaven's sake,' cried the lady of the perfume, 'let us\njoin Herr B\u00c3\u00b6hme at supper!'\n\n'Let me present you to my wife,' said Dollmann.\n\nSo this was the stepmother; unmistakably German, I may add. I made my\nbow, and underwent much the same sort of frank scrutiny as Davies,\nonly that it was rather more favourable to me, and ended in a carmine\nsmile.\n\nThere was a general movement and further introductions. Davies was\nled to the stepmother, and I found myself confronting the daughter\nwith quickened pulses, and a sudden sense of added complexity in the\nissues. I had, of course, made up my mind to ignore our meeting of\nyesterday, and had assumed that she would do the same. And she did\nignore it--we met as utter strangers; nor did I venture (for other\neyes were upon us) to transmit any sign of intelligence to her. But\nthe next moment I was wondering if I had not fallen into a trap. She\nhad promised not to tell, but under what circumstances? I saw the\nscene again; the misty flats, the spruce little sail-boat and its\nsweet young mistress, fresh as a dewy flower, but blanched and\ndemoralized by a horrid fear, appealing to my honour so to act that\nwe three should never meet again, promising to be silent, but as much\nin her own interest as ours, and under that implied condition which I\nhad only equivocally refused. The condition was violated, not by her\nfault or ours, but violated. She was free to help her father against\nus, and was she helping him? What troubled me was the change in her;\nthat she--how can I express it without offence?--was less in discord\nwith her surroundings than she should have been; that in dress, pose\nand manner (as we exchanged some trivialities) she was too near\nreflecting the style of the other woman; that, in fact, she in some\nsort realized my original conception of her, so brutally avowed to\nDavies, so signally, as I had thought, falsified. In the sick\nperplexity that this discovery caused me I dare say I looked as\nfoolish as Davies had done, and more so, for the close heat of the\nroom and its tainted atmosphere, succeeding so abruptly to the\nwholesome nip of the outside air, were giving me a faintness which\nthis moral check lessened my power to combat. Von Br\u00c3\u00bcning's face wore\na sneering smile that I winced under; and, turning, I found another\npair of eyes fixed on me, those of Herr B\u00c3\u00b6hme, whose squat figure had\nappeared at a pair of folding doors leading to an adjoining room.\nNapkin in hand, he was taking in the scene before him with fat\nbenevolence, but exceeding shrewdness. I instantly noticed a faint\nred weal relieving the ivory of his bald head; and I had suffered too\noften in the same quarter myself to mistake its origin, namely, our\ncabin doorway.\n\n'This is the other young explorer, B\u00c3\u00b6hme,' said von Br\u00c3\u00bcning. 'Herr\nDavies kidnapped him a month ago, and bullied and starved him into\nsubmission; they'll drown together yet. I believe his sufferings have\nbeen terrible.'\n\n'His sufferings are over,' I retorted. 'I've\nmutinied--deserted--haven't I, Davies?' I caught Davies gazing with\nsolemn _gaucherie_ at Miss Dollmann.\n\n'Oh, what?' he stammered. I explained in English. 'Oh, yes,\nCarruthers has to go home,' he said, in his vile lingo.\n\nNo one spoke for a moment, and even von Br\u00c3\u00bcning had no persiflage\nready.\n\n'Well, are we never going to have supper?' said Madame impatiently;\nand with that we all moved towards the folding doors. There had been\nlittle formality in the proceedings so far, and there was less still\nin the supper-room. B\u00c3\u00b6hme resumed his repast with appetite, and the\nrest of us sat down apparently at random, though an underlying method\nwas discernible. As it worked out, Dollmann was at one end of the\nsmall table, with Davies on his right and B\u00c3\u00b6hme on his left; Frau\nDollmann at the other, with me on her right and von Br\u00c3\u00bcning on her\nleft. The seventh personage, Fr\u00c3\u00a4ulein Dollmann, was between the\nCommander and Davies on the side opposite to me. No servants\nappeared, and we waited on ourselves. I have a vague recollection of\nvarious excellent dishes, and a distinct one of abundance of wine.\nSomeone filled me a glass of champagne, and I confess that I drained\nit with honest avidity, blessing the craftsman who coaxed forth the\nessence, the fruit that harboured it, the sun that warmed it.\n\n'Why are you going so suddenly?' said von Br\u00c3\u00bcning to me across the\ntable.\n\n'Didn't I tell you we had to call here for letters? I got mine this\nmorning, and among others a summons back to work. Of course I must\nobey.' (I found myself speaking in a frigid silence.) 'The annoying\nthing was that there were two letters, and if I had only come here\ntwo days sooner I should have only got the first, which gave me an\nextension.'\n\n'You are very conscientious. How will they know?'\n\n'Ah, but the second's rather urgent.' There was another uncomfortable\nsilence, broken by Dollmann.\n\n'By the way, Herr Davies,' he began, 'I ought to apologize to you\nfor----'\n\nThis was no business of mine, and the less interest I took in it the\nbetter; so I turned to Frau Dollmann and abused the fog.\n\n'Have you been in the harbour all day?' she asked, 'then how was it\nyou did not visit us? Was Herr Davies so shy?' (Curiosity or malice?)\n\n'Quite the contrary; but I was,' I answered coldly; 'you see, we knew\nHerr Dollmann was away, and we really only called here to get my\nletters; besides, we did not know your address.' I looked at Clara\nand found her talking gaily to von Br\u00c3\u00bcning, deaf seemingly to our\nlittle dialogue.\n\n'Anyone would have told you it,' said Madame, raising her eyebrows.\n\n'I dare say; but directly after breakfast the fog came on, and--well,\none cannot leave a yacht alone in a fog,' I said, with professional\nsolidity.\n\nVon Br\u00c3\u00bcning pricked up his ears at this. 'I'll be hanged if that was\n_your_ maxim,' he laughed; 'you're too fond of the shore!'\n\nI sent him a glance of protest, as though to say: 'What's the use of\nyour warning if you won't let me act on it?'\n\nFor, of course, my excuses were meant chiefly for his consumption,\nand Fr\u00c3\u00a4ulein Dollmann's. That the lady I addressed them to found them\nunpalatable was not my fault.\n\n'Then you sat in your wretched little cabin all day?' she persisted.\n\n'All day,' I said, brazenly; 'it was the safest thing to do.' And I\nlooked again at Fr\u00c3\u00a4ulein Dollmann, frankly and squarely. Our eyes\nmet, and she dropped hers instantly, but not before I had learnt\nsomething; for if ever I saw misery under a mask it was on her face.\nNo; she had not told.\n\nI think I puzzled the stepmother, who shrugged her white shoulders,\nand said in that case she wondered we had dared to leave our precious\nboat and come to supper. If we knew Frisian fogs as well as she\ndid----\n\nOh, I explained, we were not so nervous as that; and as for\nsupper on shore, if she only knew what a Spartan life we led----\n\n'Oh, for mercy's sake, don't tell me about it!' she cried, with a\ngrimace; 'I hate the mention of yachts. When I think of that dreadful\n'Medusa' coming from Hamburg----' I sympathized with half my attention,\nkeeping one strained ear open for developments on my right. Davies, I\nknew, was in the thick of it, and none too happy under B\u00c3\u00b6hme's eye,\nbut working manfully. 'My fault'--'sudden squall'--'quite safe', were\nsome of the phrases I caught; while I was aware, to my alarm, that he\nwas actually drawing a diagram of something with bread-crumbs and\ntable-knives. The subject seemed to gutter out to an awkward end, and\nsuddenly B\u00c3\u00b6hme, who was my right-hand neighbour, turned to me. 'You\nare starting for England to-morrow morning?' he said.\n\n'Yes,' I answered; 'there is a steamer at 8.15, I believe.'\n\n'That is good. We shall be companions.'\n\n'Are you going to England, too, sir?' I asked, with hot misgivings.\n\n'No, no! I am going to Bremen; but we shall travel together as far\nas--you go by Amsterdam, I suppose?--as far as Leer, then. That will\nbe very pleasant.' I fancied there was a ghoulish gusto in his tone.\n\n'Very,' I assented. 'You are making a short stay here, then?'\n\n'As long as usual. I visit the work at Memmert once a month or so,\nspend a night with my friend Dollmann and his charming family' (he\nleered round him), 'and return.'\n\nWhether I was right or wrong in my next step I shall never know, but\nobeying a strong instinct, 'Memmert,' I said; 'do tell me more about\nMemmert. We heard a good deal about it from Commander von Br\u00c3\u00bcning;\nbut----'\n\n'He was discreet, I expect,' said B\u00c3\u00b6hme.\n\n'He left off at the most interesting part.'\n\n'What's that about me?' joined in von Br\u00c3\u00bcning.\n\n'I was saying that we're dying to know more about Memmert, aren't we,\nDavies?'\n\n'Oh, I don't know,' said Davies, evidently aghast at my temerity; but\nI did not mind that. If he roughed my suit, so much the better; I\nintended to rough his.\n\n'You gave us plenty of history, Commander, but you did not bring it\nup to date.' The triple alliance laughed, Dollmann boisterously.\n\n'Well,' said von Br\u00c3\u00bcning; 'I gave you very good reasons, and you\nacquiesced.'\n\n'And now he is trying to pump _me_,' said B\u00c3\u00b6hme, with his rasping\nchuckle.\n\n'Wait a bit, sir; I have an excuse. The Commander was not only\nmysterious but inaccurate. I appeal to you, Herr Dollmann, for it was\n_\u00c3\u00a0 propos_ of you. When we fell in with him at Bensersiel, Davies\nasked him if you were at home, and he said \"No.\" When would you be\nback? Probably soon; _but he did not know when_.'\n\n'Oh, he said that?' said Dollmann.\n\n'Well, only three days later we arrive at Norderney, and find you\nhave returned that very day, but have gone to Memmert. Again (by the\nway) the mysterious Memmert! But more than ever mysterious now, for\nin the evening, not only you and Herr B\u00c3\u00b6hme----'\n\n'What penetration!' laughed von Br\u00c3\u00bcning.\n\n'But also Commander von Br\u00c3\u00bcning, pay us a visit in _his_ launch, all\ncoming from Memmert!'\n\n'And you infer?' said von Br\u00c3\u00bcning.\n\n'Why, that you must have known at Bensersiel--only three days\nago--exactly when Herr Dollmann was coming back, having an\nappointment at Memmert with him for to-day.'\n\n'Which I wished to conceal from you?'\n\n'Yes, and that's why I'm so inquisitive; it's entirely your own\nfault.'\n\n'So it seems,' said he, with mock humility; 'but fill your glass and\ngo on, young man. Why should I want to deceive you?'\n\n'That's just what I want to know. Come, confess now; wasn't there\nsomething important afoot to-day at Memmert? Something to do with the\ngold? You were inspecting it, sorting it, weighing it? Or _I_ know! You\nwere transporting it secretly to the mainland?'\n\n'Not a very good day for that! But softly, Herr Carruthers; no\nfishing for admissions. Who said we had found any gold?'\n\n'Well, have you? There!'\n\n'That's better! Nothing like candour, my young investigator. But I am\nafraid, having no authority, I cannot assist you at all. Better try\nHerr B\u00c3\u00b6hme again. I'm only a casual onlooker.'\n\n'With shares.'\n\n'Ah! you remember that? (He remembers everything!) With a few shares,\nthen; but with no expert knowledge. Now, B\u00c3\u00b6hme is the consulting\nengineer. Rescue me, B\u00c3\u00b6hme.'\n\n'I cannot disclaim expert knowledge,' said B\u00c3\u00b6hme, with humorous\ngravity; 'but I disclaim responsibility. Now, Herr Dollmann is\nchairman of the company.'\n\n'And I,' said Dollmann, with a noisy laugh, 'must fall back on the\nshareholders, whose interests I have to guard. One can't be too\ncareful in these confidential matters.'\n\n'Here's one who gives his consent,' I said. 'Can't he represent the\nrest?'\n\n'Extorted by torture,' said von Br\u00c3\u00bcning. 'I retract.'\n\n'Don't mind them, Herr Carruthers,' cried Frau Dollmann, 'they are\nmaking fun of you; but I will give you a hint; no woman can keep a\nsecret----'\n\n'Ah!' I cried, triumphantly, 'you have been there?'\n\n'I? Not I; I detest the sea! But Clara has.' Everyone looked at\nClara, who in her turn looked in na\u00c3\u00afve bewilderment from me to her\nfather.\n\n'Indeed?' I said, more soberly, 'but perhaps she is not a free\nagent.'\n\n'Perfectly free!' said Dollmann.\n\n'I have only been there once, some time ago,' said she, 'and I saw no\ngold at all.'\n\n'Guarded,' I observed. 'I beg your pardon; I mean that perhaps you\nonly saw what you were allowed to see. And, in any case, the Fr\u00c3\u00a4ulein\nhas no expert knowledge and no responsibility, and, perhaps, no\nshares. Her province is to be charming, not to hold financial\nsecrets.'\n\n'I have done my best to help you,' said the stepmother.\n\n'They're all against us, Davies.'\n\n'Oh, chuck it, Carruthers!' said Davies, in English.\n\n'He's insatiable,' said von Br\u00c3\u00bcning, and there was a pause; clearly,\nthey meant to elicit more.\n\n'Well, I shall draw my own conclusions,' I said.\n\n'This is interesting,' said von Br\u00c3\u00bcning, 'in what sense?'\n\n'It begins to dawn on me that you made fools of us at Bensersiel.\nDon't you remember, Davies, what an interest he took in all our\ndoings? I wonder if he feared our exploring propensities might\npossibly lead us to Memmert?'\n\n'Upon my word, this is the blackest ingratitude. I thought I made\nmyself particularly agreeable to you.'\n\n'Yes, indeed; especially about the duck shooting! How useful your\nlocal man would have been--both to us and to you!'\n\n'Go on,' said the Commander, imperturbably.\n\n'Wait a moment; I'm thinking it out.' And thinking it out I was in\ndeadly earnest, for all my levity, as I pressed my hand on my burning\nforehead and asked myself where I was to stop in this seductive but\nperilous fraud. To carry it too far was to court complete exposure;\nto stop too soon was equally compromising.\n\n'What is he talking about, and why go on with this ridiculous\nmystery?' said Frau Dollmann.\n\n'I was thinking about this supper party, and the way it came about,'\nI pursued, slowly.\n\n'Nothing to complain of, I hope?' said Dollmann.\n\n'Of course not! Impromptu parties are always the pleasantest, and\nthis one was delightfully impromptu. Now I bet you I know its origin!\nDidn't you discuss us at Memmert? And didn't one of you suggest----?\n\n'One would almost think you had been there,' said Dollmann.\n\n'You may thank your vile climate that we weren't,' I retorted, laughing.\n'But, as I was saying, didn't one of you suggest--which of you? Well,\nI'm sure it wasn't the Commander----'\n\n'Why not?' said B\u00c3\u00b6hme.\n\n'It's difficult to explain--an intuition, say--I am sure he stood up\nfor us; and I don't think it was Herr Dollmann, because he knows\nDavies already, and he's always on the spot; and, in short I'll swear\nit was Herr B\u00c3\u00b6hme, who is leaving early to-morrow, and had never seen\neither of us. It was you, sir, who proposed that we should be asked\nto supper to-night--for inspection?'\n\n'Inspection?' said B\u00c3\u00b6hme; 'what an extraordinary idea!'\n\n'You can't deny it, though! And one thing more; in the harbour just\nnow--no--this is going too far; I shall mortally offend you.' I gave\nway to hearty laughter.\n\n'Come, let's have it. Your hallucinations are diverting.'\n\n'If you insist; but this is rather a delicate matter. You know we\nwere a little surprised to find you _all_ on board; and you, Herr\nB\u00c3\u00b6hme, did you always take such a deep interest in small yachts? I am\nafraid that it was at a certain sacrifice of comfort that you\n_inspected_ ours!' And I glanced at the token he bore of his\nencounter with our lintel. There was a burst of pent-up merriment, in\nwhich Dollmann took the loudest share.\n\n'I warned you, B\u00c3\u00b6hme,' he said.\n\nThe engineer took the joke in the best possible part.\n\n'We owe you apologies,' he conceded.\n\n'Don't mention it,' said Davies.\n\n'_He_ doesn't mind,' I said; 'I'm the injured one. I'm sure you never\nsuspected Davies, who could?' (Who indeed? I was on firm ground\nthere.)\n\n'The point is, what did you take _me_ for?'\n\n'Perhaps we take you for it still,' said von Br\u00c3\u00bcning.\n\n'Oho! Still suspicious? Don't drive me to extremities.'\n\n'What extremities?'\n\n'When I get back to London I shall go to Lloyd's! I haven't forgotten\nthat flaw in the title.' There was an impressive silence.\n\n'Gentlemen,' said Dollmann, with exaggerated solemnity, 'we must come\nto terms with this formidable young man. What do you say?'\n\n'Take me to Memmert,' I exclaimed. 'Those are my terms!'\n\n'Take you to Memmert? But I thought you were starting for England\nto-morrow?'\n\n'I ought to; but I'll stay for that.'\n\n'You said it was urgent. Your conscience is very elastic.'\n\n'That's my affair. Will you take me to Memmert?'\n\n'What do you say, gentlemen?' B\u00c3\u00b6hme nodded. 'I think we owe some\nreparation. Under promise of absolute secrecy, then?'\n\n'Of course, now that you trust me. But you'll show me\neverything--honour bright--wreck, dep\u00c3\u00b4t, and all?'\n\n'Everything; if you don't object to a diver's dress.'\n\n'Victory!' I cried, in triumph. 'We've won our point, Davies. And\nnow, gentlemen, I don't mind saying that as far as I am concerned the\njoke's at an end; and, in spite of your kind offer, I must start for\nEngland to-morrow' under the good Herr B\u00c3\u00b6hme's wing. And in case my\nelastic conscience troubles you (for I see you think me a\nweather-cock) here are the letters received this morning,\nestablishing my identity as a humble but respectable clerk in the\nBritish Civil Service, summoned away from his holiday by a tyrannical\nsuperior.' (I pulled out my letters and tossed them to Dollmann.)\n'Ah, you don't read English easily, perhaps? I dare say Herr B\u00c3\u00b6hme\ndoes.'\n\nLeaving B\u00c3\u00b6hme to study dates, postmarks, and contents to his heart's\ncontent, and unobserved, I turned to sympathize with my fair\nneighbour, who complained that her head was going round; and no\nwonder. But at this juncture, and very much to my surprise, Davies\nstruck in.\n\n'_I_ should like to go to Memmert,' he said.\n\n'You?' said von Br\u00c3\u00bcning. 'Now I'm surprised at that.'\n\n'But you won't be staying here either, Davies,' I objected.\n\n'Yes, I shall,' said Davies. 'Why, I told you I should. If you leave\nme in the lurch like this I must have time to look round.'\n\n'You needn't pretend that you cannot sail alone,' said von Br\u00c3\u00bcning.\n\n'It's much more fun with two; I think I shall wire for another\nfriend. Meanwhile, I should like to see Memmert.'\n\n'That's only an excuse, I'm afraid,' said I.\n\n'I want to shoot ducks too,' pursued Davies, reddening. 'I always\nhave wanted to; and you promised to help in that, Commander.'\n\n'You can't get out of it now,' I laughed.\n\n'Certainly not,' said he, unmoved; 'but, honestly, I should advise\nHerr Davies, if he is ever going to get home this season, to make the\nbest of this fine weather.'\n\n'It's too fine,' said Davies; 'I prefer wind. If I cannot get a\nfriend I think I shall stop cruising, leave the yacht here, and come\nback for her next year.\n\nThere was some mute telegraphy between the allies.\n\n'You can leave her in my charge,' said Dollmann, 'and start with your\nfriend to-morrow.'\n\n'Thanks; but there is no hurry,' said Davies, growing redder than\never. 'I like Norderney--and we might have another sail in your\ndinghy, Fr\u00c3\u00a4ulein,' he blurted out.\n\n'Thank you,' she said, in that low dry voice I had heard yesterday;\n'but I think I shall not be sailing again--it is getting too cold.'\n\n'Oh, no!' said Davies, 'it's splendid.' But she had turned to von\nBr\u00c3\u00bcning, and took no notice.\n\n'Well, send me a report about Memmert, Davies,' I laughed, with the\nidea of drawing attention from his rebuff. But Davies, having once\ndelivered his soul, seemed to have lost his shyness, and only gazed\nat his neighbour with the placid, dogged expression that I knew so\nwell. That was the end of those delicate topics; and conviviality\ngrew apace.\n\nI am not indifferent at any time to good wine and good cheer, nor was\nit for lack of pressing that I drank as sparingly as I was able, and\npretended to a greater elation than I felt. Nor certainly was it from\nany fine scruples as to the character of the gentleman whose\nhospitality we were receiving--scruples which I knew affected Davies,\nwho ate little and drank nothing. In any case he was adamant in such\nmatters, and I verily believe would at any time have preferred our\nown little paraffin-flavoured messes to the best dinner in the world.\nIt was a very wholesome caution that warned me not to abuse the\nfinest brain tonic ever invented by the wit of man. I had finessed\nMemmert, as one finesses a low card when holding a higher; but I had\ntoo much respect for our adversaries to trade on any fancied security\nwe had won thereby. They had allowed me to win the trick, but I\ncredited them with a better knowledge of my hand than they chose to\nshow. On the other hand I hugged the axiom that in all conflicts it\nis just as fatal to underrate the difficulties of your enemy as to\noverrate your own. Their chief one--and it multiplied a thousandfold\nthe excitement of the contest--was, I felt sure, the fear of striking\nin error; of using a sledge-hammer to break a nut. In breaking it\nthey risked publicity, and publicity, I felt convinced, was death to\ntheir secret. So, even supposing they had detected the finesse, and\nguessed that we had in fact got wind of imperial designs; yet, even\nso, I counted on immunity so long as they thought we were on the\nwrong scent, with Memmert, and Memmert alone, as the source of our\nsuspicions.\n\nHad it been necessary I was prepared to encourage such a view,\nadmitting that the cloth von Br\u00c3\u00bcning wore had made his connexion with\nMemmert curious, and had suggested to Davies, for I should have put\nit on him, with his naval enthusiasms, that the wreck-works were\nreally naval-defence works. If they went farther, and suspected that\nwe had tried to go to Memmert that very day, the position was worse,\nbut not desperate; for the fear that they would take the final step\nand suppose that we had actually got there and overheard their talk, I\nflatly refused to entertain, until I should find myself under arrest.\n\nPrecisely how near we came to it I shall never rightly know; but I\nhave good reason to believe that we trembled on the verge. The main\nissue was fully enough for me, and it was only in passing flashes\nthat I followed the play of the warring under-currents. And yet,\nlooking back on the scene, I would warrant there was no party of\nseven in Europe that evening where a student of human documents would\nhave found so rich a field, such noble and ignoble ambitions, such\nbase and holy fears, aye, and such pitiful agonies of the spirit.\nRoughly divided though we were into separate camps, no two of us were\nwholly at one. Each wore a mask in the grand imposture; excepting, I\nam inclined to think, the lady on my left, who, outside her own\nwell-being, which she cultivated without reserve, had, as far as I\ncould see, but one axe to grind--the intimacy of von Br\u00c3\u00bcning and her\nstepdaughter--and ground it openly.\n\nNot even B\u00c3\u00b6hme and von Br\u00c3\u00bcning were wholly at one; and as moral\ndistances are reckoned, Davies and I were leagues apart. Sitting\nbetween Dollmann and Dollmann's daughter, the living and breathing\nsymbols of the two polar passions he had sworn to harmonize, he kept\nan equilibrium which, though his aims were nominally mine, I could\nnot attain to. For me the man was the central figure; if I had\nattention to spare it was on him that I bestowed it; groping\ndisgustfully after his hidden springs of action, noting the evidences\nof great gifts squandered and prostituted; questioning where he was\nmost vulnerable; whom he feared most, us or his colleagues; whether\nhe was open to remorse or shame; or whether he meditated further\ncrime. The girl was incidental. After the first shock of surprise I\nhad soon enough discovered that she, like the rest, had assumed a\ndisguise; for she was far too innocent to sustain the deception; and\nyesterday was fresh in my memory. I was forced to continue turning\nher assumed character to account; but it would be pharisaical in me\nto say that I rose to any moral heights in her regard--wine and\nexcitement had deadened my better nature to that extent. I thought\nshe looked prettier than ever, and, as time passed, I fell into a\ncynical carelessness about her. This glimpse of her home life, and\nthe desperate expedients to which she was driven (whether by\ncompulsion or from her own regard for Davies) to repel and dismiss\nhim, did not strike me as they might have done as the crowning\nargument in favour of the course we had adopted the night before,\nthat of compassing our end without noise and scandal, disarming\nDollmann, but aiding him to escape from the allies he had betrayed.\nTo Davies, the man, if not a pure abstraction, was at most a noxious\nvermin to be trampled on for the public good; while the girl, in her\nblackguardly surroundings, and with her sinister future, had become\nthe very source of his impulse.\n\nAnd the other players? B\u00c3\u00b6hme was _my_ abstraction, the fortress whose\nfoundations we were sapping, the embodiment of that systematized\nforce which is congenital to the German people. In von Br\u00c3\u00bcning, the\npersonal factor was uppermost. Callous as I was this evening, I could\nnot help wondering occasionally, as he talked and laughed with Clara\nDollmann, what in his innermost thoughts, knowing her father, he felt\nand meant. It is a point I cannot and would not pursue, and, thank\nHeaven, it does not matter now; yet, with fuller knowledge of the\nfacts, and, I trust, a mellower judgement, I often return to the same\ndebate, and, by I know not what illogical bypaths, always arrive at\nthe same conclusion, that I liked the man and like him still.\n\nWe behaved as sportsmen in the matter of time, giving them over two\nhours to make up their minds about us. It was only when tobacco-smoke\nand heat brought back my faintness, and a twinge of cramp warned me\nthat human strength has limits, that I rose and said we must go; that\nI had to make an early start to-morrow. I am hazy about the\nfarewells, but I think that Dollmann was the most cordial, to me at\nany rate, and I augured good therefrom. B\u00c3\u00b6hme said he should see me\nagain. Von Br\u00c3\u00bcning, though bound for the harbour also, considered it\nwas far too early to be going yet, and said good-bye.\n\n'You want to talk us over,' I remember saying, with the last flicker\nof gaiety I could muster.\n\nWe were in the streets again, under a silver, breathless night;\ndizzily footing the greasy ladder again; in the cabin again, where I\ncollapsed on a sofa just as I was, and slept such a deep and\nstringent sleep that the men of the _Blitz_'s launch might have\nhandcuffed and trussed and carried me away, without incommoding me in\nthe least.\n\n\n\n\nXXV. I Double Back\n\n\n'GOOD-BYE, old chap,' called Davies.\n\n'Good-bye,' the whistle blew and the ferry-steamer forged ahead,\nleaving Davies on the quay, bareheaded and wearing his old Norfolk\njacket and stained grey flannels, as at our first meeting in\nFlensburg station. There was no bandaged hand this time, but he\nlooked pinched and depressed; his eyes had black circles round them;\nand again I felt that same indefinable pathos in him.\n\n'Your friend is in low spirits,' said B\u00c3\u00b6hme, who was installed on a\nseat beside me, voluminously caped and rugged against the biting air.\nIt was a still, sunless day.\n\n'So am I,' I grunted, and it was the literal truth. I was only half\nawake, felt unwashed and dissipated, heavy in head and limbs. But for\nDavies I should never have been where I was. It was he who had\npatiently coaxed me out of my bunk, packed my bag, fed me with tea\nand an omelette (to which I believe he had devoted peculiarly tender\ncare), and generally mothered me for departure. While I swallowed my\nsecond cup he was brushing the mould and smoothing the dents from my\nfelt hat, which had been entombed for a month in the sail-locker;\nworking at it with a remorseful concern in his face. The only\ninitiative I am conscious of having shown was in the matter of my\nbag. 'Put in my sea clothes, oils, and all,' I had said; 'I may want\nthem again.' There was mortal need of a thorough consultation, but\nthis was out of the question. Davies did not badger or complain, but\nonly timidly asked me how we were to meet and communicate, a question\non which my mind was an absolute blank.\n\n'Look out for me about the 26th,' I suggested feebly.\n\nBefore we left the cabin he gave me a scrap of pencilled paper and\nsaw that it went safely into my pocket-book. 'Look at it in the\ntrain,' he said.\n\nUnable to cope with B\u00c3\u00b6hme, I paced the deck aimlessly as we swung\nround the See Gat into the Buse Tief, trying to identify the point\nwhere we crossed it yesterday blindfold. But the tide was full, and\nthe waters blank for miles round till they merged in haze. Soon I\ndrifted down into the saloon, and crouching over a stove pulled out\nthat scrap of paper. In a crabbed, boyish hand, and much besmudged\nwith tobacco-ashes, I found the following notes:\n\n(1) _Your journey_. [See Maps A and B.] Norddeich 8.58, Emden 10.32,\nLeer 11.16 (B\u00c3\u00b6hme changes for Bremen), Rheine 1.8 (change), Amsterdam\n7.17 p.m. Leave again _via_ Hook 8.52, London 9 am.\n\n(2) The coast-station--_their_ rondezvous--querry is it _Norden_? (You\npass it 9.13)--there is a tidal creek up to it. High-water there on\n25th, say 10.30 to 11 p.m. It cannot be Norddeich, which I find has a\ndredged-out low-water channel for the steamer, so tide 'serves' would\nnot apply.\n\n(3) _Your other clews_ (tugs, pilots, depths, railway, Esens, seven\nof something). Querry: Scheme of defence by land and sea for North\nSea Coast?\n\n_Sea_--7 islands, 7 channels between (counting West Ems), very small\ndepths (what you said) in most of them. Tugs and pilots for patrol\nwork behind islands, as I always said. Querry: Rondezvous is for\ninspecting channels?\n\n_Land_--Look at railway (map in ulster pocket) running in a loop all\nround Friesland, a few miles from coast. Querry: To be used as line\nof communication for army corps. Troops could be quickly sent to any\nthreatened point. _Esens_ the base? It is in top centre of loop. Von\nBrooning dished us fairly over that at Bensersiel.\n\n_Chatham_--D. was spying after our naval plans for war with Germany.\n\nVon Brooning runs naval part over here.\n\nWhere does Burmer come in? Querry--you go to Bremen and find out\nabout him?\n\nI nodded stupidly over this document--so stupidly that I found myself\nwondering whether Burmer was a place or a person. Then I dozed, to\nwake with a violent start and find the paper on the floor.\nPanic-stricken, I hid it away, and went on deck, when I found we were\nclose to Norddeich, running up to the bleakest of bleak jetties\nthrown out from the dyke-bound polders of the mainland. B\u00c3\u00b6hme and I\nlanded together, and he was at my elbow as I asked for a ticket for\nAmsterdam, and was given one as far as Rheine, a junction near the\nDutch frontier. He was ensconced in an opposite corner to me in the\nrailway carriage, looking like an Indian idol. 'Where do you come\nin?' I pondered, dreamily. Too sleepy to talk, I could only blink at\nhim, sitting bolt upright with my arms folded over my precious\npocket-book. Finally, I gave up the struggle, buttoned my ulster\ntightly up, and turning my back upon him with an apology, lay down to\nsleep, the precious pocket nethermost. He was at liberty to rifle my\nbag if he chose, and I dare say he did. I cannot say, for from this\npoint till Rheine, for the best part of four hours, that is, I had\nonly two lucid intervals.\n\nThe first was at Emden, where we both had to change. Here, as we\npushed our way down the crowded platform, B\u00c3\u00b6hme, after being greeted\nrespectfully by several persons, was at last buttonholed without\nmeans of escape by an obsequious gentleman, whose description is of\nno moment, but whose conversation is. It was about a canal; what\ncanal I did not gather, though, from a name dropped, I afterwards\nidentified it as one in course of construction as a feeder to the\nEms. The point is that the subject was canals. At the moment it was\nseed dropped in unreceptive soil, but it germinated later. I passed\non, mingling with the crowd, and was soon asleep again in another\ncarriage where B\u00c3\u00b6hme this time did not follow me.\n\nThe second occasion was at Leer, where I heard myself called by name,\nand woke to find him at the window. He had to change trains, and had\ncome to say good-bye. 'Don't forget to go to Lloyd's,' he grated in\nmy ear. I expect it was a wan smile that I returned, for I was at a\nvery low ebb, and my fortress looked sarcastically impregnable. But\nthe sapper was free; 'free' was my last conscious thought.\n\nEven after Rheine, where I changed for the last time, a brutish\ndrowsiness enchained me, and the afternoon was well advanced before\nmy faculties began to revive.\n\nThe train crept like a snail from station to station. I might, so a\nfellow-passenger told me, have waited three hours at Rheine for an\nexpress which would have brought me to Amsterdam at about the same\ntime; or, if I had chosen to break the journey farther back, two\nhours at either Emden or Leer would still have enabled me to catch\nthe said express at Rheine. These alternatives had escaped Davies,\nand, I surmised, had been suppressed by B\u00c3\u00b6hme, who doubtless did not\nwant me behind him, free either to double back or to follow him to\nBremen.\n\nThe pace, then, was execrable, and there were delays; we were behind\ntime at Hengelo, thirty minutes late at Apeldoorn; so that I might\nwell have grown nervous about my connexions at Amsterdam, which were\nin some jeopardy. But as I battled out of my lethargy and began to\ntake account of our position and prospects, quite a different thought\nat the outset affected me. Anxiety to reach London was swamped in\nreluctance to quit Germany, so that I found myself grudging every\nmile that I placed between me and the frontier. It was the old\nquestion of urgency. To-day was the 23rd. The visit to London meant a\nminimum absence of forty-eight hours, counting from Amsterdam; that\nis to say, that by travelling for two nights and one day, and\ndevoting the other day to investigating Dollmann's past, it was\nhumanly possible for me to be back on the Frisian coast on the\nevening of the 25th. Yes, I could be at Norden, if that was the\n'rendezvous', at 7 p.m. But what a scramble! No margin for delays, no\nphysical respite. Some pasts take a deal of raking up--other persons\nmay be affected; men are cautious, they trip you up with red tape; or\nthe man who knows is out at lunch--a protracted lunch; or in the\ncountry--a protracted week-end. Will you see Mr So-and-so, or leave a\nnote? Oh! I know those public departments--from the inside! And the\nAdmiralty! ... I saw myself baffled and racing back the same night to\nGermany, with two days wasted, arriving, good for nothing, at Norden,\nwith no leisure to reconnoitre my ground; to be baffled again there,\nprobably, for you cannot always count on fogs (as Davies said). Esens\nwas another clue, and 'to follow Burmer'--there was something in that\nnotion. But I wanted time, and had I time? How long could Davies\nmaintain himself at Norderney? Not so very long, from what I\nremembered of last night. And was he even safe there? A feverish\ndream recurred to me--a dream of Davies in a diving-dress; of a\nregrettable hitch in the air-supply--Stop, that was nonsense! ... Let\nus be sane. What matter if he had to go? What matter if I took my\ntime in London? Then with a flood of shame I saw Davies's wistful\nface on the quay, heard his grim ejaculation: 'He's our game or no\none's'; and my own sullen 'Oh, I'll keep the secret!' London was\nutterly impossible. If I found my informant, what credentials had I,\nwhat claim to confidences? None, unless I told the whole story. Why,\nmy mere presence in Whitehall would imperil the secret; for, once on\nmy native heath, I should be recognized--possibly haled to judgement;\nat the best should escape in a cloud of rumour--'last heard of at\nNorderney'; 'only this morning was raising Cain at the Admiralty\nabout a mythical lieutenant.' No! Back to Friesland, was the word.\nOne night's rest--I must have that--between sheets, on a feather bed;\none long, luxurious night, and then back refreshed to Friesland, to\nfinish our work in our own way, and with none but our own weapons.\n\nHaving reached this resolve, I was nearly putting it into instant\nexecution, by alighting at Amersfoort, but thought better of it. I\nhad a transformation to effect before I returned north, and the more\npopulous centre I made it in the less it was likely to attract\nnotice. Besides, I had in my mind's eye a perfect bed in a perfect\nhostelry hard by the Amstel River. It was an economy in the end.\n\nSo, at half-past eight I was sipping my coffee in the aforesaid\nhostelry, with a London newspaper before me, which was unusually\ninteresting, and some German journals, which, 'in hate of a wrong not\ntheirs', were one and all seething with rancorous Anglophobia. At\nnine I was in the Jewish quarter, striking bargains in an infamous\nmarine slop-shop. At half-past nine I was despatching this\nunscrupulous telegram to my chief--'Very sorry, could not call\nNorderney; hope extension all right; please write to H\u00c3\u00b4tel du Louvre,\nParis.' At ten I was in the perfect bed, rapturously flinging my\nlimbs abroad in its glorious redundancies. And at 8.28 on the\nfollowing morning, with a novel chilliness about the upper lip, and a\nvast excess of strength and spirits, I was sitting in a third-class\ncarriage, bound for Germany, and dressed as a young seaman, in a\npea-jacket, peaked cap, and comforter.\n\nThe transition had not been difficult. I had shaved off my moustache\nand breakfasted hastily in my bedroom, ready equipped for a journey\nin my ulster and cloth cap. I had dismissed the hotel porter at the\nstation, and left my bag at the cloak-room, after taking out of it an\number bundle and substituting the ulster. The umber bundle, which\nconsisted of my oilskins, and within them my sea-boots and a few\nother garments and necessaries, the whole tied up with a length of\ntarry rope, was now in the rack above me, and (with a stout stick)\nrepresented my luggage. Every article in it--I shudder at their\norigin--was in strict keeping with my humble _m\u00c3\u00a9tier,_ for I knew\nthey were liable to search at the frontier Custom-house; but there\nwas a Baedeker of Northern Germany in my jacket pocket.\n\nFor the nonce, if questions were asked, I was an English seaman,\ngoing to Emden to join a ship, with a ticket as far as the frontier.\nBeyond that a definite scheme of action had still to be thought out.\nOne thing, however, was sure. I was determined to be at Norden\nto-morrow night, the 25th. A word about Norden, which is a small town\nseven miles south of Norddeich. When hurriedly scanning the map for\ncoast stations in the cabin yesterday, I had not thought of Norden,\nbecause it did not appear to be on the coast, but Davies had noticed\nit while I slept, and I now saw that his pencilled hint was a shrewd\none. The creek he spoke of, though barely visible on the map, _[see\nMap B]_ flowed into the Ems Estuary in a south-westerly direction.\nThe 'night train' tallied to perfection, for high tide in the creek\nwould be, as Davies estimated, between 10.30 and 11 p.m. on the night\nof the 25th; and the time-table showed that the only night train\narriving at Norden was one from the south at 10.46 p.m. This looked\npromising. Emden, which I had inclined to on the spur of the moment,\nwas out of court in comparison, for many reasons; not the least being\nthat it was served by three trains between 9 p.m. and 1 a.m., so that\nthe phrase 'night train' would be ambiguous and not decisive as with\nNorden.\n\nSo far good; but how was I to spend the intervening time? Should I\nact on Davies's 'querry' and go to Bremen after B\u00c3\u00b6hme? I soon\ndismissed that idea. It was one to act upon if others failed; for the\npresent it meant another scramble. Bremen is six hours from Norden by\nrail. I should spend a disproportionate amount of my limited time in\ntrains, and I should want a different disguise. Besides, I had\nalready learnt something fresh about B\u00c3\u00b6hme; for the seed dropped at\nEmden Station yesterday had come to life. A submarine engineer I knew\nhim to be before; I now knew that canals were another branch of his\nlabours--not a very illuminating fact; but could I pick up more in a\nsingle day?\n\nThere remained Esens, and it was thither I resolved to go to-night--a\ntedious journey, lasting till past eight in the evening; but there I\nshould only be an hour from Norden by rail.\n\nAnd at Esens?\n\nAll day long I strove for light on the central mystery, collecting\nfrom my diary, my memory, my imagination, from the map, the\ntime-table, and Davies's grubby jottings, every elusive atom of\nmaterial. Sometimes I issued from a reverie with a start, to find a\nphlegmatic Dutch peasant staring strangely at me over his china pipe.\nI was more careful over the German border. Davies's paper I soon knew\nby heart. I pictured him writing it with his cramped fist in his\ncorner by the stove, fighting against sleep, absently striking salvos\nof matches, while I snored in my bunk; absently diverging into\ndreams, I knew, of a rose-brown face under dewy hair and a grey\ntam-o'-shanter; though not a word of her came into the document. I\nsmiled to see his undying faith in the 'channel theory' reconciled at\nthe eleventh hour, with new data touching the neglected 'land'.\n\nThe result was certainly interesting, but it left me cold. That there\nexisted in the German archives some such scheme of defence for the\nNorth Sea coast was very likely indeed. The seven islands, with their\nseven shallow channels (though, by the way, two of them, the twin\nbranches of the Ems, are by no means so shallow), were a very fair\nconjecture, and fitted in admirably with the channel theory, whose\nintrinsic merits I had always recognized; my constant objection\nhaving been that it did not go nearly far enough to account for our\ntreatment. The ring of railway round the peninsula, with Esens at the\napex, was suggestive, too; but the same objection applied. Every\ncountry with a maritime frontier has, I suppose, secret plans of\nmobilization for its defence, but they are not such as could be\ndiscovered by passing travellers, not such as would warrant stealthy\nsearches, or require for their elaboration so recondite a\nmeeting-place as Memmert. Dollmann was another weak point; Dollmann\nin England, spying. All countries, Germany included, have spies in\ntheir service, dirty though necessary tools; but Dollmann in such\nintimate association with the principal plotters on this side;\nDollmann rich, influential, a power in local affairs--it was clear he\nwas no ordinary spy.\n\nAnd here I detected a hesitation in Davies's rough sketch, a\nreluctance, as it were, to pursue a clue to its logical end. He spoke\nof a German scheme of coast defence, and in the next breath of\nDollmann spying for English plans in the event of war with Germany,\nand there he left the matter; but what sort of plans? Obviously (if\nhe was on the right track) plans of attack on the German coast as\nopposed to those of strategy on the high seas. But what sort of an\nattack? Obviously again, if his railway-ring meant anything, an\nattack by invasion on that remote and desolate littoral which he had\nso often himself declared to be impregnably secure behind its web of\nsands and shallows. My mind went back to my question at Bensersiel,\n'Can this coast be invaded?' to his denial and our fruitless survey\nof the dykes and polders. Was he now reverting to a fancy we had both\nrejected, while shrinking from giving it explicit utterance? The\ndoubt was tantalizing.\n\nA brief digression here about the phases of my journey. At Rheine I\nchanged trains, turned due north and became a German seaman. There\nwas little risk in a defective accent--sailors are so polyglot; while\nan English sailor straying about Esens might excite curiosity.\nYesterday I had paid no heed to the landscape; to-day I neglected\nnothing that could conceivably supply a hint.\n\nFrom Rheine to Emden we descended the valley of the Ems; at first\nthrough a land of thriving towns and fat pastures, degenerating\nfarther north to spaces of heathery bog and moorland--a sad country,\nbut looking at its best, such as that was, for I should mention here\nthat the weather, which in the early morning had been as cold and\nmisty as ever, grew steadily milder and brighter as the day advanced;\nwhile my newspaper stated that the glass was falling and the\nanticyclone giving way to pressure from the Atlantic.\n\nAt Emden, where we entered Friesland proper, the train crossed a big\ncanal, and for the twentieth time that day (for we had passed numbers\nof them in Holland, and not a few in Germany), I said to myself,\n'Canals, canals. Where does B\u00c3\u00b6hme come in?' It was dusk, but light\nenough to see an unfamiliar craft, a torpedo-boat in fact, moored to\nstakes at one side. In a moment I remembered that page in the _North\nSea Pilot_ where the Ems-Jade Canal is referred to as deep enough to\ncarry gun-boats, and as used for that strategic purpose between\nWilhelmshaven and Emden, along the base, that is, of the Frisian\npeninsula. I asked a peasant opposite; yes, that was the Ems-Jade\nCanal. Had Davies forgotten it? It would have greatly strengthened\nhis halting sketch.\n\nAt the bookstall at Emden I bought a pocket ordnance map [There is,\nof course, no space to reproduce this, but here and henceforward the\nreader is referred to Map B.] of Friesland, on a much larger scale\nthan anything I had used before, and when I was unobserved studied\nthe course of the canal, with an impatience which, alas! quickly\ncooled. From Emden northwards I used the same map to aid my eyesight,\nand with its help saw in the gathering gloom more heaths and bogs,\nonce a great glimmering lake, and at intervals cultivated tracts; a\nwatery land as ever; pools, streams and countless drains and ditches.\nExtensive woods were marked also, but farther inland. We passed\nNorden at seven, just dark. I looked out for the creek, and sure\nenough, we crossed it just before entering the station. Its bed was\nnearly dry, and I distinguished barges lying aground in it. This\nbeing the junction for Esens, I had to wait three-quarters of an\nhour, and then turned east through the uttermost northern wilds,\nstopping at occasional village stations and keeping five or six miles\nfrom the sea. It was during this stage, in a wretchedly lit\ncompartment, and alone for the most part, that I finally assembled\nall my threads and tried to weave them into a cable whose core should\nbe Esens; 'a town', so Baedeker said, 'of 3,500 inhabitants, the\ncentre of a rich agricultural district. Fine spire.'\n\nEsens is four miles inland from Bensersiel. I reviewed every\ncircumstance of that day at Bensersiel, and boiled to think how von\nBr\u00c3\u00bcning had tricked me. He had driven to Esens himself, and read me\nso well that he actually offered to take me with him, and I had\nrefused from excess of cleverness. Stay, though; if I had happened to\naccept he would have taken very good care that I saw nothing\nimportant. The secret, therefore, was not writ large on the walls of\nEsens. Was it connected with Bensersiel too, or the country between?\nI searched the ordnance map again, standing up to get a better light\nand less jolting. There was the road northwards from Esens to\nBensersiel, passing through dots and chess-board squares, the former\nmeaning fen, the latter fields, so the reference said. Something\nelse, too, immediately caught my eye, and that was a stream running\nto Bensersiel. I knew it at once for the muddy stream or drain we had\nseen at the harbour, issuing through the sluice or _siel_ from which\nBensersiel took its name. But it arrested my attention now because it\nlooked more prominent than I should have expected. Charts are apt to\nignore the geography of the mainland, except in so far as it offers\nsea-marks to mariners. On the chart this stream had been shown as a\nrough little corkscrew, like a sucking-pig's tail. On the ordnance\nmap it was marked with a dark blue line, was labelled 'Benser Tief',\nand was given a more resolute course; bends became angles, and there\nwere what appeared to be artificial straightnesses at certain points.\nOne of the threads in my skein, the canal thread, tingled\nsympathetically, like a wire charged with current. Standing astraddle\non both seats, with the map close to the lamp, I greedily followed\nthe course of the 'tief' southward. It inclined away from the road to\nEsens and passed the town about a mile to the west, diving underneath\nthe railway. Soon after it took angular tacks to the eastward, and\njoined another blue line trending south-east, and lettered\n'Esens--Wittmunder _Canal_.' This canal, however, came to an abrupt\nend halfway to Wittmund, a neighbouring town.\n\nFor the first time that day there came to me a sense of genuine\ninspiration. Those shallow depths and short distances, fractions of\nmetres and kilometres, which I had overheard from B\u00c3\u00b6hme's lips at\nMemmert, and which Davies had attributed to the outside channels--did\nthey refer to a canal? I remembered seeing barges in Bensersiel\nharbour. I remembered conversations with the natives in the inn,\nscraps of the post-master's pompous loquacity, talks of growing\ntrade, of bricks and grain passing from the interior to the islands:\nfrom another source--was it the grocer of Wangeroog?--of expansion of\nbusiness in the islands themselves as bathing resorts; from another\nsource again--von Br\u00c3\u00bcning himself, surely--of Dollmann's personal\nactivity in the development of the islands. In obscure connexion with\nthese things, I saw the torpedo-boat in the Ems-Jade Canal.\n\nIt was between Dornum and Esens that these ideas came, and I was\nstill absorbed in them when the train drew up, just upon nine\no'clock, at my destination, and after ten minutes' walk, along with a\nhandful of other passengers, I found myself in the quiet cobbled\nstreets of Esens, with the great church steeple, that we had so often\nseen from the sea, soaring above me in the moonlight.\n\n\n\n\nXXVI. The Seven Siels\n\n\nSELECTING the very humblest _Gasthaus_ I could discover, I laid down\nmy bundle and called for beer, bread, and _Wurst._ The landlord, as I\nhad expected, spoke the Frisian dialect, so that though he was rather\ndifficult to understand, he had no doubts about the purity of my own\nGerman high accent. He was a worthy fellow, and hospitably\ninterested: 'Did I want a bed?' 'No; I was going on to Bensersiel,' I\nsaid, 'to sleep there, and take the morning _Postschiff_ to Langeoog\nIsland.' (I had not forgotten our friends the twin giants and their\nfunctions.) 'I was not an islander myself?' he asked. 'No, but I had\na married sister there; had just returned from a year's voyaging, and\nwas going to visit her.' 'By the way,' I asked, 'how are they getting\non with the Benser Tief?' My friend shrugged his shoulders; it was\nfinished, he believed. 'And the connexion to Wittmund?' 'Under\nconstruction still.' 'Langeoog would be going ahead then?' 'Oh! he\nsupposed so, but he did not believe in these new-fangled schemes.'\n'But it was good for trade, I supposed? Esens would benefit in\nsending goods by the \"tief\"--what was the traffic, by the way?' 'Oh,\na few more barge-loads than before of bricks, timber, coals, etc.,\nbut it would come to nothing _he_ knew: _Aktiengesellschaften_\n(companies) were an invention of the devil. A few speculators got\nthem up and made money themselves out of land and contracts, while\nthe shareholders they had hoodwinked starved.' 'There's something in\nthat,' I conceded to this bigoted old conservative; 'my sister at\nLangeoog rents her lodging-house from a man named Dollmann; they say\nhe owns a heap of land about. I saw his yacht once--pink velvet and\nelectric light inside, they say----'\n\n'That's the name,' said mine host, 'that's one of them--some sort of\nforeigner, I've heard; runs a salvage concern, too, Juist way.'\n\n'Well, he won't get any of my savings!' I laughed, and soon after\ntook my leave, and inquired from a passer-by the road to Dornum.\n'Follow the railway,' I was told.\n\nWith a warm wind in my face from the south-west, fleecy clouds and a\nhalf-moon overhead, I set out, not for Bensersiel but for Benser\nTief, which I knew must cross the road to Dornum somewhere. A mile or\nso of cobbled causeway flanked with ditches and willows, and running\ncheek by jowl with the railway track; then a bridge, and below me the\n'Tief'; which was, in fact, a small canal. A rutty track left the\nroad, and sloped down to it one side; a rough siding left the\nrailway, and sloped down to it on the other.\n\nI lit a pipe and sat on the parapet for a little. No one was\nstirring, so with great circumspection I began to reconnoitre the\nleft bank to the north. The siding entered a fenced enclosure by a\nlocked gate--a gate I could have easily climbed, but I judged it\nwiser to go round by the bridge again and look across. The enclosure\nwas a small coal-store, nothing more; there were gaunt heaps of coal\nglittering in the moonlight; a barge half loaded lying alongside, and\na deserted office building. I skulked along a sandy towpath in\nsolitude. Fens and field were round me, as the map had said; willows\nand osier-beds; the dim forms of cattle; the low melody of wind\nroaming unfettered over a plain; once or twice the flutter and quack\nof a startled wild-duck.\n\nPresently I came to a farmhouse, dark and silent; opposite it, in the\ncanal, a couple of empty barges. I climbed into one of these, and\nsounded with my stick on the off-side--barely three feet; and the\ntorpedo-boat melted out of my speculations. The stream, I observed\nalso, was only just wide enough for two barges to pass with comfort.\nOther farms I saw, or thought I saw, and a few more barges lying in\nside-cuts linked by culverts to the canal, but nothing noteworthy;\nand mindful that I had to explore the Wittmund side of the railway\ntoo, I turned back, already a trifle damped in spirits, but still\nkeenly expectant.\n\nPassing under the road and railway, I again followed the tow-path,\nwhich, after half a mile, plunged into woods, then entered a clearing\nand another fenced enclosure; a timber-yard by the look of it. This\ntime I stripped from the waist downward, waded over, dressed again,\nand climbed the paling. (There was a cottage standing back, but its\noccupants evidently slept.) I was in a timber-yard, by the stacks of\nwood and the steam saw-mill; but something more than a timber-yard,\nfor as I warily advanced under the shadow of the trees at the edge of\nthe clearing I came to a long tin shed which strangely reminded me of\nMemmert, and below it, nearer the canal, loomed a dark skeleton\nframework, which proved to be a half-built vessel on stocks. Close by\nwas a similar object, only nearly completed--a barge. A paved slipway\nled to the water here, and the canal broadened to a siding or\nback-water in which lay seven or eight more barges in tiers. I scaled\nanother paling and went on, walking, I should think, three miles by\nthe side of the canal, till the question of bed and ulterior plans\nbrought me to a halt. It was past midnight, and I was adding little\nto my information. I had encountered a brick-field, but soon after\nthat there was increasing proof that the canal was as yet little used\nfor traffic. It grew narrower, and there were many signs of recent\nlabour for its improvement. In one place a dammed-off deviation was\nbeing excavated, evidently to abridge an impossible bend. The path\nhad become atrocious, and my boots were heavy with clay. Bearing in\nmind the abruptly-ending blue line on the map, I considered it\nuseless to go farther, and retraced my steps, trying to concoct a\nstory which would satisfy an irritable Esens inn-keeper that it was a\nrespectable wayfarer, and not a tramp or a lunatic, who knocked him\nup at half-past one or thereabouts.\n\nBut a much more practical resource occurred to me as I approached the\ntimber-yard; for lodging, free and accessible, lay there ready to\nhand. I boarded one of the empty barges in the backwater, and\nsurveyed my quarters for the night. It was of a similar pattern to\nall the others I had seen; a lighter, strictly, in the sense that it\nhad no means of self-propulsion, and no separate quarters for a crew,\nthe whole interior of the hull being free for cargo. At both bow and\nstern there were ten feet or so of deck, garnished with bitts and\nbollards. The rest was an open well, flanked by waterways of\nsubstantial breadth; the whole of stout construction and, for a\nhumble lighter, of well-proportioned and even graceful design, with a\nmarked forward sheer, and, as I had observed in the specimen on the\nstocks, easy lines at the stern. In short, it was apparent, even to\nan ignorant landsman like myself, that she was designed not merely\nfor canal work but for rough water; and well she might be, for,\nthough the few miles of sea she had to cross in order to reach the\nislands were both shallow and sheltered, I knew from experience what\na vicious surf they could be whipped into by a sudden gale. It must\nnot be supposed that I dwelt on this matter. On limited lines I was\nmaking progress, but the wings of imagination still drooped\nnervelessly at my sides. Otherwise I perhaps should have examined\nthis lighter more particularly, instead of regarding it mainly as a\nconvenient hiding-place. Under the stern-deck was stored a massive\nroll of tarpaulin, a corner of which made an excellent blanket, and\nmy bundle a good pillow. It was a descent from the luxury of last\nnight; but a spy, I reflected philosophically, cannot expect a\nfeather bed two nights running, and this one was at any rate airier\nand roomier than the coffin-like bunk of the _Dulcibella_, and not so\nvery much harder.\n\nWhen snugly ensconced, I studied the map by intermittent match-light.\nIt had been dawning on me in the last half-hour that this canal was\nonly one of several; that in concentrating myself on Esens and\nBensersiel, I had forgotten that there were other villages ending in\nsiel, also furnished on the chart with corkscrew streams; and,\nmoreover, that B\u00c3\u00b6hme's statistics of depth and distance had been\nmarshalled in seven categories, A to G. The very first match brought\nfull recollection as to the villages. The suffix _siel_ repeated\nitself all round the coast-line. Five miles eastward of Bensersiel\nwas Neuharlingersiel, and farther on Carolinensiel. Four miles\nwestward was Dornumersiel; and farther on Nessmersiel and\nHilgenriedersiel. That was six on the north coast of the peninsula\nalone. On the west coast, facing the Ems, there was only one,\nGreetsiel, a good way south of Norden. But on the east, facing the\nJade, there were no less than eight, at very close intervals. A\nmoment's thought and I disregarded this latter group; they had\nnothing to do with Esens, nor had they any imaginable _raison d'\u00c3\u00a9tre_\nas veins for commerce; differing markedly in this respect from the\ngroup of six on the north coast, whose outlook was the chain of\nislands, and whose inland centre, almost exactly, was Esens. I still\nwanted one to make seven, and as a working hypothesis added the\nsolitary Greetsiel. At all seven villages streams debouched, as at\nBensersiel. From all seven points of issue dotted lines were marked\nseaward, intersecting the great tidal sands and leading towards the\nislands. And on the mainland behind the whole sevenfold system ran\nthe loop of railway. But there were manifold minor points of\ndifference. No stream boasted so deep and decisive a blue lintel as\ndid Benser Tief; none penetrated so far into the Hinterland. They\nvaried in length and sinuosity. Two, those belonging to\nHilgenriedersiel and Greetsiel, appeared not to reach the railway at\nall. On the other hand, Carolinensiel, opposite Wangeroog Island, had\na branch line all to itself.\n\nMatch after match waxed and waned as I puzzled over the mystic seven.\nIn the end I puzzled myself to sleep, with the one fixed idea that\nto-morrow, on my way back to Norden, I must see more of these budding\ncanals, if such they were. My dreams that night were of a mighty\nchain of redoubts and masked batteries couching _perdus_ among the\nsand-dunes of desolate islets; built, coral-like, by infinitely slow\nand secret labour; fed by lethal cargoes borne in lighters and in\ncharge of stealthy mutes who, one and all, bore the likeness of\nGrimm.\n\nI was up and away at daylight (the weather mild and showery),\nmeeting some navvies on my way back to the road, who gave me good\nmorning and a stare. On the bridge I halted and fell into torments of\nindecision. There was so much to do and so little time to do it in.\nThe whole problem seemed to have been multiplied by seven, and the\ntotal again doubled and redoubled--seven blue lines on land, seven\ndotted lines on the sea, seven islands in the offing. Once I was near\ndeciding to put my pretext into practice, and cross to Langeoog; but\nthat meant missing the rendezvous, and I was loth to do that.\n\nAt any rate, I wanted breakfast badly; and the best way to get it,\nand at the same time to open new ground, was to walk to Dornum. Then\nI should find a blue line called the _Neues Tief_ leading to\nDornumersiel, on the coast. That explored, I could pass on to Nesse,\nwhere there was another blue line to Nessmersiel. All this was on the\nway to Norden, and I should have the railway constantly at my back,\nto carry me there in the evening. The last train (my time-table told\nme) was one reaching Norden at 7.15 p.m. I could catch this at Hage\nStation at 7.5.\n\nA brisk walk of six miles brought me, ravenously hungry, to Dornum.\nRoad and railway had clung together all the time, and about half-way\nhad been joined on the left by a third companion in the shape of a\npuny stream which I knew from the map to be the upper portion of\nNeues Tief. Wriggling and doubling like an eel, choked with sedges\nand reeds, it had no pretensions to being navigable. At length it\nlooped away into the fens out of sight, only to reappear again close\nto Dornum in a much more dignified guise.\n\nThere was no siding where the railway crossed it, but at the town\nitself, which it skirted on the east, a towpath began, and a piled\nwharf had been recently constructed. Going on to this was a red-brick\nbuilding with the look of a warehouse, roofless as yet, and with\nworkmen on its scaffolds. It sharpened the edge of my appetite.\n\nIf I had been wise I should have been content with a snack bought at\na counter, but a thirst for hot coffee and clues induced me to repeat\nthe experiment of Esens and seek a primitive beer-house. I was less\nlucky on this occasion. The house I chose was obscure enough, but its\nproprietor was no simple Frisian, but an ill-looking rascal with\nshifty eyes and a debauched complexion, who showed a most unwelcome\ncuriosity in his customer. As a last fatality, he wore a peaked cap\nlike my own, and turned out to be an ex-sailor. I should have fled at\nthe sight of him had I had the chance, but I was attended to first by\na slatternly girl who, I am sure, called him up to view me. To\nexplain my muddy boots and trousers I said I had walked from Esens,\nand from that I found myself involved in a tangle of impromptu lies.\nFloundering down an old groove, I placed my sister this time on\nBaltrum Island, and said I was going to Dornumersiel (which is\nopposite Baltrum) to cross from there. As this was drawing a bow at a\nventure, I dared not assume local knowledge, and spoke of the visit\nas my first. Dornumersiel was a lucky shot; there _was_ a\nferry-galliot from there to Baltrum; but he knew, or pretended to\nknow, Baltrum, and had not heard of my sister. I grew the more\nnervous in that I saw from the first that he took me to be of better\ncondition than most merchant seamen; and, to make matters worse, I\nwas imprudent enough in pleading haste to pull out from an inner\npocket my gold watch with the chain and seals attached. He told me\nthere was no hurry, that I should miss the tide at Dornumersiel, and\nthen fell to pressing strong waters on me, and asking questions whose\ninsinuating grossness gave me the key to his biography. He must have\nbeen at one stage in his career a dock-side crimp, one of those foul\nsharks who prey on discharged seamen, and as often as not are\nex-seamen themselves, versed in the weaknesses of the tribe. He was\nnow keeping his hand in with me, who, unhappily, purported to belong\nto the very class he was used to victimize, and, moreover, had a gold\nwatch, and, doubtless, a full purse. Nothing more ridiculously\ninopportune could have befallen me, or more dangerous; for his class\nare as cosmopolitan as waiters and _concierges,_ with as facile a\ngift for language and as unerring a scent for nationality. Sure\nenough, the fellow recognized mine, and positively challenged me with\nit in fairly fluent English with a Yankee twang. Encumbered with the\nmythical sister, of course I stuck to my lie, said I had been on an\nEnglish ship so long that I had picked up the accent, and also gave\nhim some words in broken English. At the same time I showed I thought\nhim an impertinent nuisance, paid my score and walked out--quit of\nhim? Not a bit of it! He insisted on showing me the way to\nDornumersiel, and followed me down the street. Perceiving that he was\nin liquor, in spite of the early hour, I dared not risk a quarrelsome\nscene with a man who already knew so much about me, and might at any\nmoment elicit more. So I melted, and humoured him; treated him in a\nginshop in the hope of giving him the slip--a disastrous resource,\nwhich was made a precedent for further potations elsewhere. I would\ngladly draw a veil over our scandalous progress through peaceable\nDornum, of the terrors I experienced when he introduced me as his\nfriend, and as his English friend, and of the abasement I felt, too,\nas, linked arm in arm, we trod the three miles of road coastwards. It\nwas his malicious whim that we should talk English; a fortunate whim,\nas it turned out, because I knew no fo'c'sle German, but had a\nsmattering of fo'c'sle English, gathered from Cutcliffe Hyne and\nKipling. With these I extemporized a disreputable hybrid, mostly\nconsisting of oaths and blasphemies, and so yarned of imaginary\nvoyages. Of course he knew every port in the world, but happily was\nnone too critical, owing to repeated _schnappsen._\n\nNevertheless, it was a deplorable _contretemps_ from every point of\nview. I was wasting my time, for the road took a different direction\nto the Neues Tief, so that I had not even the advantage of inspecting\nthe canal and only met with it when we reached the sea. Here it split\ninto two mouths, both furnished with locks, and emptying into two\nlittle mud-hole harbours, replicas of Bensersiel, each owning its\ncluster of houses. I made straight for the _Gasthaus_ at\nDornumersiel, primed my companion well, and asked him to wait while I\nsaw about a boat in the harbour; but, needless to say, I never\nrejoined him. I just took a cursory look at the left-hand harbour,\nsaw a lighter locking through (for the tide was high), and then\nwalked as fast as my legs would carry me to the outermost dyke,\nmounted it, and strode along the sea westwards in the teeth of a\nsmart shower of rain, full of deep apprehensions as to the stir and\ngossip my disappearance might cause if my odious crimp was sober\nenough to discover it. As soon as I deemed it safe, I dropped on to\nthe sand and ran till I could run no more. Then I sat on my bundle\nwith my back to the dyke in partial shelter from the rain, watching\nthe sea recede from the flats and dwindle into slender meres, and the\nladen clouds fly weeping over the islands till those pale shapes were\nlost in mist.\n\nThe barge I had seen locking through was creeping across towards\nLangeoog behind a tug and a wisp of smoke.\n\nNo more exploration by daylight! That was my first resolve, for I\nfelt as if the country must be ringing with reports of an Englishman\nin disguise. I must remain in hiding till dusk, then regain the\nrailway and slink into that train to Norden. Now directly I began to\nresign myself to temporary inaction, and to centre my thoughts on the\nrendezvous, a new doubt assailed me. Nothing had seemed more certain\nyesterday than that Norden was the scene of the rendezvous, but that\nwas before the seven _siels_ had come into prominence. The name\nNorden now sounded naked and unconvincing. As I wondered why, it\nsuddenly occurred to me that _all_ the stations along this northern\nline, though farther inland than Norden, were equally 'coast\nstations', in the sense that they were in touch with harbours (of a\nsort) on the coast. Norden had its tidal creek, but Esens and Dornum\nhad their 'tiefs' or canals. Fool that I had been to put such a\nnarrow and literal construction on the phrase 'the tide serves!'\nWhich was it more likely that my conspirators would visit--Norden,\nwhose intrusion into our theories was purely hypothetical, or one of\nthese _siels_ to whose sevenfold systems all my latest observations\ngave such transcendent significance?\n\nThere was only one answer; and it filled me with profound\ndiscouragement. Seven possible rendezvous!--eight, counting Norden.\nWhich to make for? Out came the time-table and map, and with them\nhope. The case was not so bad after all; it demanded no immediate\nchange of plan, though it imported grave uncertainties and risks.\nNorden was still the objective, but mainly as a railway junction,\nonly remotely as a seaport. Though the possible rendezvous were\neight, the possible stations were reduced to five--Norden, Hage,\nDornum, Esens, Wittmund--all on one single line. Trains from east to\nwest along this line were negligible, because there were none that\ncould be called night trains, the latest being the one I had this\nmorning fixed on to bring me to Norden, where it arrived at 7.15. Of\ntrains from west to east there was only one that need be considered,\nthe same one that I had travelled by last night, leaving Norden at\n7.43 and reaching Esens at 8.50, and Wittmund at 9.13. This train, as\nthe reader who was with me in it knows, was in correspondence with\nanother from Emden and the south, and also, I now found, with\nservices from Hanover, Bremen, and Berlin. He will also remember that\nI had to wait three-quarters of an hour at Norden, from 7 to 7.43.\n\nThe platform at Norden Junction, therefore, between 7.15, when I\nshould arrive at it _from_ the east, and 7.43 when B\u00c3\u00b6hme and his\nunknown friend should leave it _for_ the east; there, and in that\nhalf-hour, was my opportunity for recognizing and shadowing two at\nleast of the conspirators. I must take the train they took, and\nalight where they alighted. If I could not find them at all I should\nbe thrown back on the rejected view that Norden itself was the\nrendezvous, and should wait there till 10.46.\n\nIn the meantime it was all very well to resolve on inaction till\ndusk; but after an hour's rest, damp clothes and feet, and the\nabsence of pursuers, tempted me to take the field again. Avoiding\nroads and villages as long as it was light, I cut across country\nsouth-westwards--a dismal and laborious journey, with oozy fens and\nknee-deep drains to course, with circuits to be made to pass clear of\npeasants, and many furtive crouchings behind dykes and willows. What\nlittle I learnt was in harmony with previous explorations, for my\ntrack cut at right angles the line of the Harke Tief, the stream\nissuing at Nessmersiel. It, too, was in the nature of a canal, but\nonly in embryo at the point I touched it, south of Nesse. Works on a\ndeviation were in progress, and in a short digression down stream I\nsighted another lighter-building yard. As for Hilgenriedersiel, the\nfourth of the seven, I had no time to see anything of it at all. At\nseven o'clock I was at Hage Station, very tired, wet, and footsore,\nafter covering nearly twenty miles all told since I left my bed in\nthe lighter.\n\nFrom here to Norden it was a run in the train of ten minutes, which I\nspent in eating some rye bread and smoked eel, and in scraping the\nmud off my boots and trousers. Fatigue vanished when the train drew\nup at the station, and the momentous twenty-eight minutes began to\nrun their course. Having donned a bulky muffler and turned up the\ncollar of my pea-jacket, I crossed over immediately to the\nup-platform, walked boldly to the booking-office, and at once\nsighted--von Br\u00c3\u00bcning--yes, von Br\u00c3\u00bcning in mufti; but there was no\nmistaking his tall athletic figure, pleasant features, and neat brown\nbeard. He was just leaving the window, gathering up a ticket and some\ncoins. I joined a _queue_ of three or four persons who were waiting\ntheir turn, flattened myself between them and the partition till I\nheard him walk out. Not having heard what station he had booked for,\nI took a fourth-class ticket to Wittmund, which covered all chances.\nThen, with my chin buried in my muffler, I sought the darkest corner\nof the ill-lit combination of bar and waiting-room where, by the\ntiresome custom in Germany, would-be travellers are penned till their\ntrain is ready. Von Br\u00c3\u00bcning I perceived sitting in another corner,\nwith his hat over his eyes and a cigar between his lips. A boy\nbrought me a tankard of tawny Munich beer, and, sipping it, I\nwatched. People passed in and out, but nobody spoke to the sailor in\nmufti. When a quarter of an hour elapsed, a platform door opened, and\na raucous voice shouted: 'Hage, Dornum, Esens, Wittmund!' A knot of\npassengers jostled out to the platform, showing their tickets. I was\nslow over my beer, and was last of the knot, with von Br\u00c3\u00bcning\nimmediately ahead of me, so close that his cigar-smoke curled into my\nface. I looked over his shoulder at the ticket he showed, missed the\nname, but caught a muttered double sibilant from the official who\nchecked it; ran over the stations in my head, and pounced on _Esens._\nThat was as much I wanted to know for the present; so I made my way\nto a fourth-class compartment, and lost sight of my quarry, not\nventuring, till the last door had banged, to look out of the window.\nWhen I did so two late arrivals were hurrying up to a carriage--one\ntall, one of middle height; both in cloaks and comforters. Their\nfeatures I could not distinguish, but certainly neither of them was\nB\u00c3\u00b6hme. They had not come through the waiting-room door, but, plainly,\nfrom the dark end of the platform, where they had been waiting. A\nguard, with some surly remonstrances, shut them in, and the train\nstarted.\n\nEsens--the name had not surprised me; it fulfilled a presentiment\nthat had been growing in strength all the afternoon. For the last\ntime I referred to the map, pulpy and blurred with the day's\nexposure, and tried to etch it into my brain. I marked the road to\nBensersiel, and how it converged by degrees on the Benser Tief until\nthey met at the sea. 'The tide serves!' Longing for Davies to help\nme, I reckoned, by the aid of my diary, that high tide at Bensersiel\nwould be about eleven, and for two hours, I remembered (say from ten\nto twelve to-night), there were from five to six feet of water in the\nharbour.\n\nWe should reach Esens at 8.50. Would they drive, as von Br\u00c3\u00bcning had\ndone a week ago? I tightened my belt, stamped my mud-burdened boots,\nand thanked God for the Munich beer. Whither were they going from\nBensersiel, and in what; and how was I to follow them? These were\nnebulous questions, but I was in fettle for anything; boat-stealing\nwas a bagatelle. Fortune, I thought, smiled; Romance beckoned; even\nthe sea looked kind. Ay, and I do not know but that Imagination was\nalready beginning to unstiffen and flutter those nerveless wings.\n\n\n\n\nXXVII. The Luck of the Stowaway\n\n\nAT Esens Station I reversed my Norden tactics, jumped out smartly,\nand got to the door of egress first of all, gave up my ticket, and\nhung about the gate of the station under cover of darkness. Fortune\nsmiled still; there was no vehicle in waiting at all, and there were\nonly half a dozen passengers. Two of these were the cloaked gentlemen\nwho had been so nearly left behind at Norden, and another was von\nBr\u00c3\u00bcning. The latter walked well in advance of the first pair, but at\nthe gate on to the high road the three showed a common purpose, in\nthat, unlike the rest, who turned towards Esens town, they turned\nsouthwards; much to my perplexity, for this was the contrary\ndirection to Bensersiel and the sea. I, with my bundle on my\nshoulder, had been bringing up the rear, and, as their faithful\nshadow, turned to the right too, without foreseeing the consequence.\nWhen it was too late to turn back I saw that, fifty yards ahead, the\nroad was barred by the gates of a level crossing, and that the four\nof us must inevitably accumulate at the barrier till the train had\nsteamed away. This, in fact, happened, and for a minute or two we\nwere all in a group, elaborately indifferent to one another, silent,\nbut I am sure very conscious. As for me, 'secret laughter tickled all\nmy soul'. When the gates were opened the three seemed disposed to\nlag, so I tactfully took my cue, trudged briskly on ahead, and\nstopped after a few minutes to listen. Hearing nothing I went\ncautiously back and found that they had disappeared; in which\ndirection was not long in doubt, for I came on a grassy path leading\ninto the fields on the left or west of the road, and though I could\nsee no one I heard the distant murmur of receding voices.\n\nI took my bearings collectedly, placed one foot on the path, thought\nbetter of it, and turned back towards Esens. I knew without reference\nto the map that that path would bring them to the Benser Tief at a\npoint somewhere near the timber-yard. In a fog I might have followed\nthem there; as it was, the night was none too dark, and I had my\nstrength to husband; and stamped on my memory were the words 'the\ntide serves'. I judged it a wiser use of time and sinew to anticipate\nthem at Bensersiel by the shortest road, leaving them to reach it by\nway of the devious Tief, to examine which was, I felt convinced, one\nof their objects.\n\nIt was nine o'clock of a fresh wild night, a halo round the beclouded\nmoon. I passed through quiet Esens, and in an hour I was close to\nBensersiel, and could hear the sea. In the rooted idea that I should\nfind Grimm on the outskirts, awaiting visitors, I left the road short\nof the village, and made a circuit to the harbour by way of the\nsea-wall. The lower windows of the inn shed a warm glow into the\nnight, and within I could see the village circle gathered over cards,\nand dominated as of old by the assertive little postmaster, whose\nhigh-pitched, excitable voice I could clearly distinguish, as he sat\nwith his cap on the back of his head and a 'feine schnapps' at his\nelbow. The harbour itself looked exactly the same as I remembered it\na week ago. The post-boat lay in her old berth at the eastern jetty,\nher mainsail set and her twin giants spitting over the rail. I hailed\nthem boldly from the shore (without showing them who I was), and was\ntold they were starting for Langeoog in a few minutes; the wind was\noff-shore, the mails aboard, and the water just high enough. 'Did I\nwant a passage?' 'No, I thought I would wait.' Positive that my party\ncould never have got here so soon, I nevertheless kept an eye on the\ngalliot till she let go her stern-rope and slid away. One contingency\nwas eliminated. Some loiterers dispersed, and all port business\nappeared to be ended for the night.\n\nThree-quarters of an hour of strained suspense ensued. Most of it I\nspent on my knees in a dark angle between the dyke and the western\njetty, whence I had a strategic survey of the basin; but I was driven\nat times to relieve inaction by sallies which increased in audacity.\nI scouted on the road beyond the bridge, hovered round the lock, and\npeered in at the inn parlour; but nowhere could I see a trace of\nGrimm. I examined every floating object in the harbour (they were\nvery few), dropped on to two lighters and pried under tarpaulins,\nboarded a deserted tug and two or three clumsy rowboats tied up to a\nmooring-post. Only one of these had the look of readiness, the rest\nbeing devoid of oars and rowlocks; a discouraging state of things for\na prospective boat-lifter. It was the sight of these rowboats that\nsuggested a last and most distracting possibility, namely, that the\nboat in waiting, if boat there were, might be not in the harbour at\nall, but somewhere on the sands outside the dyke, where, at this high\nstate of the tide, it would have water and to spare. Back to the dyke\nthen; but as I peered seaward on the way, contingencies evaporated\nand a solid fact supervened, for I saw the lights of a steamboat\napproaching the harbour mouth. I had barely time to gain my coign of\nvantage before she had swept in between the piers, and with a fitful\nswizzling of her screw was turning and backing down to a berth just\nahead of one of the lighters, and not fifty feet from my\nhiding-place. A deck-hand jumped ashore with a rope, while the man at\nthe wheel gave gruff directions. The vessel was a small tug, and the\nman at the wheel disclosed his identity when, having rung off his\nengines, he jumped ashore also, looked at his watch in the beam of\nthe sidelight, and walked towards the village. It was Grimm, by the\nheight and build--Grimm clad in a long tarpaulin coat and a\nsou'wester. I watched him cross the shaft of light from the inn\nwindow and disappear in the direction of the canal.\n\nAnother sailor now appeared and helped his fellow to tie up the tug.\nThe two together then went aft and began to set about some job whose\nnature I could not determine. To emerge was perilous, so I set about\na job of my own, tearing open my bundle and pulling an oilskin jacket\nand trousers over my clothes, and discarding my peaked cap for a\nsou'-wester. This operation was prompted instantaneously by the garb\nof two sailors, who in hauling on the forward warp came into the\nfield of the mast-head light.\n\nIt was something of a gymnastic masterpiece, since I was lying--or,\nrather, standing aslant--on the rough sea-wall, with crannies of\nbrick for foothold and the water plashing below me; but then I had\nnot lived in the _Dulcibella_ for nothing. My chain of thought, I\nfancy, was this--the tug is to carry my party; I cannot shadow a tug\nin a rowboat, yet I intend to shadow my party; I must therefore go\nwith them in the tug, and the first and soundest step is to mimic her\ncrew. But the next step was a hard matter, for the crew having\nfinished their job sat side by side on the bulwarks and lit their\npipes. However, a little pantomime soon occurred, as amusing as it\nwas inspiriting. They seemed to consult together, looking from the\ntug to the inn and from the inn to the tug. One of them walked a few\npaces inn-wards and beckoned to the other, who in his turn called\nsomething down the engine-room skylight, and then joined his mate in\na scuttle to the inn. Even while I watched the pantomime I was\nsliding off my boots, and it had not been consummated a second before\nI had them in my arms and was tripping over the mud in my stocking\nfeet. A dozen noiseless steps and I was over the bulwarks between the\nwheel and the smoke-stack, casting about for a hiding-place. The\nconventional stowaway hides in the hold, but there was only a\nstokehold here, occupied moreover; nor was there an empty\napple-barrel, such as Jim of _Treasure Island_ found so useful. As far\nas I could see--and I dared not venture far for fear of the\nskylight--the surface of the deck offered nothing secure. But on the\nfarther or starboard side, rather abaft the beam, there was a small\nboat in davits, swung outboard, to which common sense, and perhaps a\nvague prescience of its after utility, pointed irresistibly. In any\ncase, discrimination was out of place, so I mounted the bulwark and\ngently entered my refuge. The tackles creaked a trifle, oars and\nseats impeded me; but well before the thirsty truants had returned I\nwas settled on the floor boards between two thwarts, so placed that I\ncould, if necessary, peep over the gunwale.\n\nThe two sailors returned at a run, and very soon after voices\napproached, and I recognized that of Herr Schenkel chattering\nvolubly. He and Grimm boarded the tug and went down a companionway\naft, near which, as I peeped over, I saw a second skylight, no bigger\nthan the _Dulcibella_s', illuminated from below. Then I heard a cork\ndrawn, and the kiss of glasses, and in a minute or two they\nre-emerged. It was apparent that Herr Schenkel was inclined to stay\nand make merry, and that Grimm was anxious to get rid of him, and\nnone too courteous in showing it. The former urged that to-morrow's\ntide would do, the latter gave orders to cast off, and at length\nobserved with an angry oath that the water was falling, and he must\nstart; and, to clinch matters, with a curt good-night, he went to the\nwheel and rang up his engines. Herr Schenkel landed and strutted off\nin high dudgeon, while the tug's screw began to revolve. We had only\nglided a few yards on when the engines stopped, a short blast of the\nwhistle sounded, and, before I had had time to recast the future, I\nheard a scurry of footsteps from the direction of the dyke, first on\nthe bank, next on the deck. The last of these new arrivals panted\naudibly as he got aboard and dropped on the planks with an unelastic\nthud.\n\nHer complement made up, the tug left the harbour, but not alone.\nWhile slowly gathering way the hull checked all at once with a sharp\njerk, recovered, and increased its speed. We had something in\ntow--what? The lighter, of course, that had been lying astern of us.\n\nNow I knew what was in that lighter, because I had been to see, half\nan hour ago. It was no lethal cargo, but coal, common household coal;\nnot a full load of it, I remembered--just a good-sized mound\namidships, trimmed with battens fore and aft to prevent shifting.\n'Well,' thought I, 'this is intelligible enough. Grimm was ostensibly\nthere to call for a load of coal for Memmert. But does that mean we\nare going to Memmert?' At the same time I recalled a phrase overheard\nat the dep\u00c3\u00b4t, 'Only one--half a load.' Why half a load?\n\nFor some few minutes there was a good deal of movement on deck, and\nof orders shouted by Grimm and answered by a voice from far astern on\nthe lighter. Presently, however, the tug warmed to her work, the hull\nvibrated with energy, and an ordered peace reigned on board. I also\nrealized that having issued from the boomed channel we had turned\nwestward, for the wind, which had been blowing us fair, now blew\nstrongly over the port beam.\n\nI peeped out of my eyrie and was satisfied in a moment that as long\nas I made no noise, and observed proper prudence, I was perfectly\nsafe _until the boat was wanted_. There were no deck lamps; the two\nskylights diffused but a sickly radiance, and I was abaft the\nside-lights. I was abaft the wheel also, though thrillingly near it\nin point of distance--about twelve feet, I should say; and Grimm was\nsteering. The wheel, I should mention here, was raised, as you often\nsee them, on a sort of pulpit, approached by two or three steps and\nfenced by a breast-high arc of boarding. Only one of the crew was\nvisible, and he was acting as look-out in the extreme bows, the rays\nof the masthead lights--for a second had been hoisted in sign of\ntowage--glistening on his oilskin back. The other man, I concluded,\nwas steering the lighter, which I could dimly locate by the pale foam\nat her bow.\n\nAnd the passengers? They were all together aft, three of them,\nleaning over the taffrail, with their backs turned to me. One was\nshort and stout--B\u00c3\u00b6hme unquestionably; the panting and the thud on\nthe planks had prepared me for that, though where he had sprung from\nI did not know. Two were tall, and one of these must be von Br\u00c3\u00bcning.\nThere ought to be four, I reckoned; but three were all I could see.\nAnd what of the third? It must be he who 'insists on coming', the\nunknown superior at whose instance and for whose behoof this secret\nexpedition had been planned. And who could he be? Many times,\nneedless to say, I had asked myself that question, but never till\nnow, when I had found the rendezvous and joined the expedition, did\nit become one of burning import.\n\n'Any weather' was another of those stored-up phrases that were\n_\u00c3\u00a0 propos._ It was a dirty, squally night, not very cold, for the wind\nstill hung in the S.S.W.--an off-shore wind on this coast, causing no\nappreciable sea on the shoal spaces we were traversing. In the matter\nof our bearings, I set myself doggedly to overcome that paralysing\nperplexity, always induced in me by night or fog in these intricate\nwaters; and, by screwing round and round, succeeded so far as to\ndiscover and identify two flashing lights--one alternately red and\nwhite, far and faint astern; the other right ahead and rather\nstronger, giving white flashes only. The first and least familiar\nwas, I made out, from the lighthouse on Wangeroog; the second, well\nknown to me as our beacon star in the race from Memmert, was the\nlight on the centre of Norderney Island, about ten miles away.\n\nI had no accurate idea of the time, for I could not see my watch, but\nI thought we must have started about a quarter past eleven. We were\ntravelling fast, the funnel belching out smoke and the bow-wave\ncurling high; for the tug appeared to be a powerful little craft, and\nher load was comparatively light.\n\nSo much for the general situation. As for my own predicament, I was\nin no mood to brood on the hazards of this mad adventure, a\nhundredfold more hazardous than my fog-smothered eavesdropping at\nMemmert. The crisis, I knew, had come, and the reckless impudence\nthat had brought me here must serve me still and extricate me.\nFortune loves rough wooing. I backed my luck and watched.\n\nThe behaviour of the passengers struck me as odd. They remained in a\nrow at the taffrail, gazing astern like regretful emigrants, and\nsometimes, gesticulating and pointing. Now no vestige of the low land\nwas visible, so I was driven to the conclusion that it was the\nlighter they were discussing; and I date my awakening from the moment\nthat I realized this. But the thread broke prematurely; for the\npassengers took to pacing the deck, and I had to lie low. When next I\nwas able to raise my head they were round Grimm at the wheel,\nengaged, as far as I could discover from their gestures, in an\nargument about our course and the time, for Grimm looked at his watch\nby the light of a hand-lantern.\n\nWe were heading north, and I knew by the swell that we must be near\nthe Accumer Ee, the gap between Langeoog and Baltrum. Were we going\nout to open sea? It came over me with a rush that we _must,_ if we\nwere to drop this lighter at Memmert. Had I been Davies I should have\nbeen quicker to seize certain rigid conditions of this cruise, which\nno human power could modify. We had left after high tide. The water\ntherefore was falling everywhere; and the tributary channels in rear\nof the islands were slowly growing impassable. It was quite thirty\nmiles to Memmert, with three watersheds to pass; behind Baltrum,\nNorderney, and Juist. A skipper with nerve and perfect confidence\nmight take us over one of these in the dark, but most of the run\nwould infallibly have to be made outside. I now better understood the\nprotests of Herr Schenkel to Grimm. Never once had we seen a lighter\nin tow in the open sea, though plenty behind the barrier of islands;\nindeed it was the very existence of the sheltered byways that created\nsuch traffic as there was. It was only Grimm's _m\u00c3\u00a9tier_ and the\nincubus of the lighter that had suggested Memmert as our destination\nat all, and I began to doubt it now. That tricky hoop of sand had\nbefooled us before.\n\nAt this moment, and as if to corroborate my thought, the telegraph\nrang and the tug slowed down. I effaced myself and heard Grimm\nshouting to the man on the lighter to starboard his helm, and to the\nlook-out to come aft. The next order froze my very marrow; it was\n'lower away'. Someone was at the davits of my boat fingering the\ntackles; the forward fall-rope actually slipped in the block and\ntilted the boat a fraction. I was just wondering how far it was to\nswim to Langeoog, when a strong, imperious voice (unknown to me) rang\nout, 'No, no! We don't want the boat. The swell's nothing; we can\njump! Can't we, B\u00c3\u00b6hme?' The speaker ended with a jovial laugh.\n'Mercy!' thought I, 'are _they_ going to swim to Langeoog?' but I\nalso gasped for relief. The tug rolled lifelessly in the swell for a\nlittle, and footsteps retreated aft. There were cries of 'Achtung!'\nand some laughter, one big bump and a good deal of grinding; and on\nwe moved again, taking the strain of the tow-rope gingerly, and then\nfull-speed ahead. The passengers, it seemed, preferred the lighter to\nthe tug for cruising in; coal-dust and exposure to clean planks and a\nwarm cuddy. When silence reigned again I peeped out. Grimm was at the\nwheel still, impassively twirling the spokes, with a glance over his\nshoulder at his precious freight. And, after all, we _were_ going\noutside.\n\nClose on the port hand lay a black foam-girt shape, the east spit of\nBaltrum. It fused with the night, while we swung slowly round to\nwindward over the troubled bar. Now we were in the spacious deeps of\nthe North Sea; and feeling it too in increase of swell and volleys of\nspray.\n\nAt this point evolutions began. Grimm gave the wheel up to the\nlook-out, and himself went to the taffrail, whence he roared back\norders of 'Port!' or 'Starboard!' in response to signals from the\nlighter. We made one complete circle, steering on each point of the\nwind in succession, after that worked straight out to sea till the\nwater was a good deal rougher, and back again at a tangent, till in\nearshot of the surf on the island beach. There the manoeuvres, which\nwere clearly in the nature of a trial trip, ended; and we hove to, to\ntransship our passengers. They, when they came aboard, went straight\nbelow, and Grimm, having steadied the tug on a settled course and\nentrusted the wheel to the sailor again, stripped off his dripping\noilskin coat, threw it down on the cabin skylight, and followed them.\nThe course he had set was about west, with Norderney light a couple\nof points off the port bow. The course for Memmert? Possibly; but I\ncared not, for my mind was far from Memmert to-night. _It was the\ncourse for England too._ Yes, I understood at last. I was assisting\nat an experimental rehearsal of a great scene, to be enacted,\nperhaps, in the near future--a scene when multitudes of seagoing\nlighters, carrying full loads of soldiers, not half loads of coals,\nshould issue simultaneously, in seven ordered fleets, from seven\nshallow outlets, and, under escort of the Imperial Navy, traverse the\nNorth Sea and throw themselves bodily upon English shores.\n\nIndulgent reader, you may be pleased to say that I have been very\nobtuse; and yet, with humility, I protest against that verdict.\nRemember that, recent as are the events I am describing, it is only\nsince they happened that the possibility of an invasion of England by\nGermany has become a topic of public discussion. Davies and I had\nnever--I was going to say had never considered it; but that would not\nbe accurate, for we had glanced at it once or twice; and if any\nsingle incident in his or our joint cruise had provided a semblance\nof confirmation, he, at any rate, would have kindled to that spark.\nBut you will see how perversely from first to last circumstances\ndrove us deeper and deeper into the wrong groove, till the idea\nbecame inveterate that the secret we were seeking was one of defence\nand not offence. Hence a complete mental somersault was required,\nand, as an amateur, I found it difficult; the more so that the method\nof invasion, as I darkly comprehended it now, was of such a strange\nand unprecedented character; for orthodox invasions start from big\nports and involve a fleet of ocean transports, while none of our\nclues pointed that way. To neglect obvious methods, to draw on the\nobscure resources of an obscure strip of coast, to improve and\nexploit a quantity of insignificant streams and tidal outlets, and\nthence, screened by the islands, to despatch an armada of\nlight-draught barges, capable of flinging themselves on a\ncorrespondingly obscure and therefore unexpected portion of the\nenemy's coast; that was a conception so daring, aye, and so quixotic\nin some of its aspects, that even now I was half incredulous. Yet it\nmust be the true one. Bit by bit the fragments of the puzzle fell\ninto order till a coherent whole was adumbrated. [The reader will\nfind the whole matter dealt with in the Epilogue.]\n\nThe tug surged on into the night; a squall of rain leapt upon us and\nswept hissing astern. Baltrum vanished and the strands of Norderney\nbeamed under transient moonlight. Drunk with triumph, I cuddled in my\nrocking cradle and ransacked every unvisited chamber of the memory,\ntossing out their dusty contents, to make a joyous bonfire of some,\nand to see the residue take life and meaning in the light of the\ngreat revelation.\n\nMy reverie was of things, not persons; of vast national issues rather\nthan of the poignant human interests so closely linked with them. But\non a sudden I was recalled, with a shock, to myself, Davies, and the\npresent.\n\nWe were changing our course, as I knew by variations in the whirl of\ndraughts which whistled about me. I heard Grimm afoot again, and,\nchoosing my moment, surveyed the scene. Broad on the port-beam were\nthe garish lights of Norderney town and promenade, and the tug, I\nperceived, was drawing in to enter the See Gat. _[See Chart B.]_\n\nRound she came, hustling through the broken water of the bar, till\nher nose was south and the wind was on the starboard bow. Not a mile\nfrom me were the villa and the yacht, and the three persons of the\ndrama--three, that is, if Davies were safe.\n\nWere we to land at Norderney harbour? Heavens, what a magnificent\nclimax!--if only I could rise to it. My work here was done. At a\nstroke to rejoin Davies and be free to consummate our designs!\n\nA desperate idea of cutting the davit-tackles--I blush to think of\nthe stupidity--was rejected as soon as it was born, and instead, I\nendeavoured to imagine our approach to the pier. My boat hung on the\nstarboard side; that would be the side away from the quay, and the\ntide would be low. I could swarm down the davits during the stir of\narrival, drop into the sea and swim the few yards across the\ndredged-out channel, wade through the mud to within a short distance\nof the _Dulcibella_, and swim the rest. I rubbed the salt out of my\neyes and wriggled my cramped legs ... Hullo! why was Grimm leaving\nthe helm again? Back he went to the cabin, leaving the sailor at the\nhelm. . . We ought to be turning to port now; but no--on we went,\nsouth, for the mainland.\n\nThough one plan was frustrated, the longing to get to Davies, once\nimplanted, waxed apace.\n\nOur destination was at last beyond dispute. _[See Chart.]_ The\nchannel we were in was the same that we had cut across on our blind\nvoyage to Memmert, and the same my ferry-steamer had followed two\ndays ago. It was a _cul-de-sac_ leading to one place only, the\nlanding stage at Norddeich. The only place on the whole coast, now I\ncame to think of it, where the tug could land at this tide. There the\nquay would be on the starboard side, and I saw myself tied to my\neyrie while the passengers landed and the tug and lighter turned back\nfor Memmert; at Memmert, dawn, and discovery.\n\nThere was some way out--some way out, I repeated to myself; some way\nto reap the fruit of Davies's long tutelage in the lore of this\nstrange region. What would _he_ do?\n\nFor answer there came the familiar _frou-frou_ of gentle surf on\ndrying sands. The swell was dying away, the channel narrowing; dusky\nand weird on the starboard hand stretched leagues of new-risen sand.\nTwo men only were on deck; the moon was quenched under the vanguard\nclouds of a fresh squall.\n\nA madcap scheme danced before me. The time, I _must_ know the time!\nCrouching low and cloaking the flame with my jacket I struck a match;\n2.30 a.m.--the tide had been ebbing for about three hours and a half.\nLow water about five; they would be aground till 7.30. Danger to\nlife? None. Flares and rescuers? Not likely, with 'him who insists'\non board; besides, no one could come, there being no danger. I should\nhave a fair wind and a fair tide for _my_ trip. Grimm's coat was on\nthe skylight; we were both clean-shaved.\n\nThe helmsman gazed ahead, intent on his difficult course, and the\nwind howled to perfection. I knelt up and examined one of the\ndavit-tackles. There was nothing remarkable about it, a double and a\nsingle block (like our own peak halyards), the lower one hooked into\na ring in the boat, the hauling part made fast to a cleat on the\ndavit itself. Something there must be to give lateral support or the\nboat would have racketed abroad in the roll outside. The support, I\nfound, consisted of two lanyards spliced to the davits and rove\nthrough holes in the keel. These I leaned over and cut with my\npocket-knife; the result being a barely perceptible swaying of the\nboat, for the tug was under the lee of sands and on an even keel.\nThen I left my hiding-place, climbing out of the stern sheets by the\nafter-davit, and preparing every successive motion with exquisite\ntenderness, till I stood on the deck. In another moment I was at the\ncabin skylight, lifting Grimm's long oilskin coat. (A second's\nyielding to temptation here; but no, the skylight was ground glass,\nfastened from below. So, on with the coat, up with the collar, and\nforward to the wheel on tiptoe.) As soon as I was up to the\nengine-room skylight (that is to say, well ahead of the cabin roof) I\nassumed a natural step, went up to the pulpit and touched the\nhelmsman on the arm, as I had seen Grimm do. The man stepped aside,\ngrunting something about a light, and I took the wheel from him.\nGrimm was a man of few words, so I just jogged his satellite, and\npointed forward. He went off like a lamb to his customary place in\nthe bows, not having dreamt--why should he?--of examining me, but in\nhim I had instantly recognized one of the crew of the 'Kormoran'.\n\nMy ruse developed in all its delicious simplicity. We were, I\nestimated, about half-way to Norddeich, in the Buse Tief, a channel\nof a navigable breadth, at the utmost of two hundred yards at this\nperiod of the tide. Two faint lights, one above the other, twinkled\nfar ahead. What they meant I neither knew nor cared, since the only\nuse I put them to was to test the effect of the wheel, for this was\nthe first time I had ever tasted the sweets of command on a\nsteamboat. A few cautious essays taught me the rudiments, and nothing\ncould hinder the catastrophe now.\n\nI edged over to starboard--that was the side I had selected--and\nagain a little more, till the glistening back of the look-out gave a\nslight movement; but he was a well-drilled minion, with implicit\ntrust in the 'old man'. Now, hard over! and spoke by spoke I gave her\nthe full pressure of the helm. The look-out shouted a warning, and I\nraised my arm in calm acknowledgement. A cry came from the lighter,\nand I remember I was just thinking 'What the Dickens'll happen to\nher?' when the end came; a _euthanasia_ so mild and gradual (for the\nsands are fringed with mud) that the disaster was on us before I was\naware of it. There was just the tiniest premonitory shuddering as our\nkeel clove the buttery medium, a cascade of ripples from either beam,\nand the wheel jammed to rigidity in my hands, as the tug nestled up\nto her resting-place.\n\nIn the scene of panic that followed, it is safe to say that I was the\nonly soul on board who acted with methodical tranquillity. The\nlook-out flew astern like an arrow, bawling to the lighter. Grimm,\nwith the passengers tumbling up after him, was on deck in an instant,\nstorming and cursing; flung himself on the wheel which I had\nrespectfully abandoned, jangled the telegraph, and wrenched at the\nspokes. The tug listed over under the force of the tide; wind,\ndarkness, and rain aggravated the confusion.\n\nFor my part, I stepped back behind the smoke stack, threw off my robe\nof office, and made for the boat. Long and bitter experience of\nrunning aground had told me that that was sure to be wanted. On the\nway I cannoned into one of the passengers and pressed him into my\nservice; incidentally seeing his face, and verifying an old\nconjecture. It was one who, in Germany, has a better right to insist\nthan anyone else.\n\nAs we reached the davits there was a report like a pistol-shot from\nthe port-side--the tow-rope parting, I believe, as the lighter with\nher shallower draught swung on past the tug. Fresh tumult arose, in\nwhich I heard: 'Lower the boat,' from Grimm; but the order was\nalready executed. My ally the Passenger and I had each cast off a\ntackle, and slacked away with a run; that done, I promptly clutched\nthe wire guy to steady myself, and tumbled in. (It was not far to\ntumble, for the tug listed heavily to starboard; think of our course,\nand the set of the ebb stream, and you will see why.) The forward\nfall unhooked sweetly; but the after one lost play. 'Slack away,' I\ncalled, peremptorily, and felt for my knife. My helper above obeyed;\nthe hook yielded; I filliped away the loose tackle, and the boat\nfloated away.\n\n\n\n\nXXVIII. We Achieve our Double Aim\n\n\nWHEN, exactly, the atmosphere of misunderstanding on the stranded tug\nwas dissipated, I do not know, for by the time I had fitted the\nrowlocks and shipped sculls, tide and wind had caught me, and were\nsweeping me merrily back on the road to Norderney, whose lights\ntwinkled through the scud in the north. With my first few strokes I\nmade towards the lighter--which I could see sagging helplessly to\nleeward--but as soon as I thought I was out of sight of the tug, I\npulled round and worked out my own salvation. There was an outburst\nof shouting which soon died away. Full speed on a falling tide! They\nwere pinned there for five hours sure. It was impossible to miss the\nway, and with my stout allies heaving me forward, I made short work\nof the two-mile passage. There was a sharp tussle at the last, where\nthe Riff Gat poured its stream across my path, and then I was craning\nover my shoulder, God knows with what tense anxiety, for the low hull\nand taper mast of the _Dulcibella_. Not there! No, not where I had left\nher. I pulled furiously up the harbour past a sleeping ferry-steamer\nand--praise Heaven!--came on her warped alongside the jetty.\n\n'Who's that?' came from below, as I stepped on board.\n\n'Hush! it's me.' And Davies and I were pawing one another in the dark\nof the cabin.\n\n'Are you all right, old chap?' said he.\n\n'Yes; are you? A match! What's the time? Quick!'\n\n'Good Heavens, Carruthers, what the blazes have you done to\nyourself?' (I suspect I cut a pretty figure after my two days'\nouting.)\n\n'Ten past three. It's the invasion of England! Is Dollmann at the\nvilla?'\n\n'Invasion?'\n\n'Is Dollmann at the villa?'\n\n'Yes.'\n\n'Is the 'Medusa' afloat?'\n\n'No, on the mud.'\n\n'The devil! Are _we_ afloat?'\n\n'I think so still, but they made me shift.'\n\n'Think! Track her out! Pole her out! Cut those warps!'\n\nFor a few strenuous minutes we toiled at the sweeps till the\n_Dulcibella_ was berthed ahead of the steamer, in deeper water.\nMeanwhile I had whispered a few facts.\n\n'How soon can you get under way?' I asked.\n\n'Ten minutes.'\n\n'When's daylight?'\n\n'Sunrise about seven, first dawn about five. Where are we bound?'\n\n'Holland, or England.'\n\n'Are they invading it now?' said Davies, calmly.\n\n'No, only rehearsing!' I laughed, wildly.\n\n'Then we can wait.'\n\n'We can wait exactly an hour and a half. Come ashore and knock up\nDollmann; we must denounce him, and get them both aboard; it's now or\nnever. Holy Saints! man, not as you are!' (He was in pyjamas.) 'Sea\nclothes!'\n\nWhile he put on Christian attire, I resumed my facts and sketched a\nplan. 'Are you watched?' I asked.\n\n'I think so; by the 'Kormoran's' men.'\n\n'Is the 'Kormoran' here?'\n\n'Yes.'\n\n'The men?'\n\n'Not to-night. Grimm called for them in that tug. I was watching.\nAnd, Carruthers, the _Blitz_ is here.'\n\n'Where?'\n\n'In the roads outside--didn't you see her?'\n\n'Wasn't looking. Her skipper's safe anyway; so's B\u00c3\u00b6hme, so's the\nTertium Quid, and so are the 'Kormoran''s men. The coast's clear--it's\nnow or never.'\n\nOnce more we were traversing the long jetty and the silent streets,\nrain driving at our backs. We trod on air, I think; I remember no\nfatigue. Davies sometimes broke into a little run, muttering\n'scoundrel' to himself.\n\n'I was right--only upside down,' he murmured more than once. 'Always\nreally right--those channels are the key to the whole concern.\nChatham, our only eastern base--no North Sea base or squadron--they'd\nland at one of those God-forsaken flats off the Crouch and\nBlackwater.'\n\n'It seems a wild scheme,' I observed.\n\n'Wild? In a way. So is _any_ invasion. But it's thorough; it's\nGerman. No other country could do it. It's all dawning on me--by\nJove! It will be at the _Wash_--much the nearest, and as sandy as\nthis side.'\n\n'How's Dollmann been?' I asked.\n\n'Polite, but queer and jumpy. It's too long a story.'\n\n'Clara?'\n\n'_She's_ all right. By Jove! Carruthers--never mind.'\n\nWe found a night-bell at the villa door and rang it lustily. A window\naloft opened, and 'A message from Commander von Br\u00c3\u00bcning--urgent,' I\ncalled up.\n\nThe window shut, and soon after the hall was lighted and the door\nopened by Dollmann in a dressing-gown.\n\n'Good morning, Lieutenant X----,' I said, in English. 'Stop, we're\nfriends, you fool!' as the door was flung nearly to. It opened very\nslowly again, and we walked in.\n\n'Silence!' he hissed. The sweat stood on his steep forehead and a\nhectic flush on either cheek, but there was a smile--what a\nsmile!--on his lips. Motioning us to tread noiselessly (a vain ideal\nfor me), he led the way to the sitting-room we knew, switched on the\nlight, and faced us.\n\n'Well?' he said, in English, still smiling.\n\nI consulted my watch, and I may say that if my hand was an index to\nmy general appearance, I must have looked the most abject ruffian\nunder heaven.\n\n'We probably understand one another,' I said, 'and to explain is to\nlose time. We sail for Holland, or perhaps England, at five at the\nlatest, and we want the pleasure of your company. We promise you\nimmunity--on certain conditions, which can wait. We have only two\nberths, so that we can only accommodate Miss Clara besides yourself.'\nHe smiled on through this terse harangue, but the smile froze, as\nthough beneath it raged some crucial debate. Suddenly he laughed (a\nlow, ironical laugh).\n\n'You fools,' he said, 'you confounded meddlesome young idiots; I\nthought I had done with you. Promise me immunity? Give me till five?\nBy God, I'll give you five minutes to be off to England and be damned\nto you, or else to be locked up for spies! What the devil do you take\nme for?'\n\n'A traitor in German service,' said Davies, none too firmly. We were\nboth taken aback by this slashing attack.\n\n'A tr----? You pig-headed young marplots! I'm in _British_ service!\nYou're wrecking the work of years--and on the very threshold of\nsuccess.'\n\nFor an instant Davies and I looked at one another in stupefaction. He\nlied--I could swear he lied; but how make sure?\n\n'Why did you try to wreck Davies?' said I, mechanically.\n\n'Pshaw! They made me clear him out. I knew he was safe, and safe he\nis.'\n\nThere was only one thing for it--a last finesse, to put him to the\nproof.\n\n'Very well,' I said, after a moment or two, 'we'll clear\nout--silence, Davies!--as it appears we have acted in error; but it's\nright to tell you that we know everything.'\n\n'Not so loud, curse you! What do you know?'\n\n'I was taking notes at Memmert the other night.'\n\n'Impossible!'\n\n'Thanks to Davies. Under difficulties, of course, but I heard quite\nenough. You were reporting your English tour--Chatham, you know, and\nthe English scheme of attack, a mythical one, no doubt, as you're on\nthe right side! B\u00c3\u00b6hme and the rest were dealing with the German\nscheme of defence A to G--I heard it all--the seven islands and the\nseven channels between them (Davies knows every one of them by\nheart); and then on land, the ring of railway, Esens the centre, the\narmy corps to mobilize and entrench--all nugatory, wasted, ha!\nha!--as you're on the right s----'\n\n'Not so loud, you fiend of mischief!' He turned his back, and made an\nirresolute pace or two towards the door, his hands kneading the folds\nof his dressing-gown as they had kneaded the curtain at Memmert.\nTwice he began a question and twice broke off. 'I congratulate you,\ngentlemen,' he said, finally, and with more composure, facing us\nagain, 'you have done marvels in your misplaced zeal; but you have\ncompromised me too much already. I shall have to have you\narrested--purely for form's sake----'\n\n'Thank you,' I broke in. 'We have wasted five minutes, and time\npresses. We sail at five, and--purely for form's sake--would rather\nhave you with us.'\n\n'What do you mean?' he snarled.\n\n'I had the advantage of _you_ at Memmert, in spite of acoustic\nobstacles. Your friends made an appointment behind your back, and I,\nin my misplaced zeal, have taken some trouble to attend it; so that\nI've had a working demonstration on another matter, the invasion of\nEngland from the seven _siels_.' (Davies nudged me.) 'No, I should\nlet that pistol alone; and no, I wouldn't ring the bell. You can\narrest us if you like, but the secret's in safe hands.'\n\n'You lie!' He was right there; but he could not know it.\n\n'Do you suppose I haven't taken that precaution? But no names are\nmentioned.' He gave a sort of groan, sank into a chair, and seemed to\nage and grizzle before our very eyes.\n\n'What did you say about immunity, and Clara?' he muttered. 'We're\nfriends--we're friends!' burst out Davies, with a gulp in his voice.\n'We want to help you both.' (Through a sudden mist that filmed my\neyes I saw him impetuously walk over and lay his hand on the other's\nshoulder.) 'Those chaps are on our track and yours. Come with us.\nWake her, tell her. It'll be too late soon.'\n\nX---- shrank from his touch. 'Tell her? I can't tell her. You tell her,\nboy.' He was huddling back into his chair. Davies turned to me.\n\n'Where's her room?' I said, sharply.\n\n'Above this one.'\n\n'Go up, Carruthers,' said Davies.\n\n'Not I--I shall frighten her into a fit.'\n\n'I don't like to.'\n\n'Nonsense, man! We'll both go then.'\n\n'Don't make a noise,' said a dazed voice. We left that huddled figure\nand stole upstairs--thickly carpeted stairs, luckily. The door we\nwanted was half open, and the room behind it lighted. On the\nthreshold stood a slim white figure, bare-footed; bare-throated.\n\n'What is it, father?' she called in a whisper. 'Whom have you been\ntalking to?' I pushed Davies forward, but he hung back.\n\n'Hush, don't be frightened,' I said, 'it's I, Carruthers, and\nDavies--and Davies. May we come in, just for one moment?'\n\nI gently widened the opening of the door, while she stepped back and\nput one hand to her throat.\n\n'Please come to your father,' I said. 'We are going to take you both\nto England in the _Dulcibella_--now, at once.'\n\nShe had heard me, but her eyes wandered to Davies.\n\n'I understand not,' she faltered, trembling and cowering in such\ntouching bewilderment that I could not bear to look at her.\n\n'For God's sake, say something, Davies,' I muttered.\n\n'Clara!' said Davies, 'will you not trust us?'\n\nI heard a little gasp from her. There was a flutter of lace and\ncambric and she was in his arms, sobbing like a tired child, her\nlittle white feet between his great clumsy sea-boots--her rose-brown\ncheek on his rough jersey.\n\n'It's past four, old chap,' I remarked, brutally. 'I'm going down to\nhim again. No packing to speak of, mind. They must be out of this in\nhalf an hour.' I stumbled awkwardly on the stairs (again that\ntiresome film!) and found him stuffing some papers pell-mell into the\nstove. There were only slumbering embers in it, but he did not seem\nto notice that. 'You must be dressed in half an hour,' I said,\nfurtively pocketing a pistol which lay on the table.\n\n'Have you told her? Take her to England, you two boys. I think I'll\nstay.' He sank into a chair again.\n\n'Nonsense, she won't go without you. You must, for her sake--in half\nan hour, too.'\n\nI prefer to pass that half-hour lightly over. Davies left before me\nto prepare the yacht for sea, and I had to bear the brunt of what\nfollowed, including (as a mere episode) a scene with the step-mother,\nthe memory of which rankles in me yet. After all, she was a sensible\nwoman.\n\nAs for the other two, the girl when I saw her next, in her short\nboating skirt and tam-o'-shanter, was a miracle of coolness and\npluck. But for her I should never have got him away. And ah! how good\nit was to be out in the wholesome rain again, hurrying to the harbour\nwith my two charges, hurrying them down the greasy ladder to that\nfrail atom of English soil, their first guerdon of home and safety.\n\nOur flight from the harbour was unmolested, unnoticed. Only the first\nghastly evidences of dawn were mingling with the strangled moonlight,\nas we tacked round the pier-head and headed close-reefed down the\nRiff Gat on the lees of the ebb-tide. We had to pass under the very\nquarter of the _Blitz_, so Davies said; for, of course, he alone was on\ndeck till we reached the open sea. Day was breaking then. It was dead\nlow water, and, far away to the south, between dun swathes of sand, I\nthought I saw--but probably it was only a fancy--two black stranded\nspecks. Rail awash, and decks streaming, we took the outer swell and\nclawed close-hauled under the lee of Juist, westward, hurrying\nwestward.\n\n'Up the Ems on the flood, and to Dutch Delfzyl,' I urged. No, thought\nDavies; it was too near Germany, and there was a tidal cut through\nfrom Buse Tief. Better to dodge in behind Rottum Island. So on we\npressed, past Memmert, over the Juister Reef and the _Corinne_'s buried\nmillions, across the two broad and yeasty mouths of the Ems, till\nRottum, a wee lonesome wafer of an islet, the first of the Dutch\narchipelago, was close on the weather-bow.\n\n'We must get in behind that,' said Davies, 'then we shall be safe; I\nthink I know the way, but get the next chart; and then take a rest,\nold chap. Clara and I can manage.' (She had been on deck most of the\ntime, as capable a hand as you could wish for, better far than I in\nmy present state of exhaustion.) I crawled along the slippery sloping\nplanks and went below.\n\n'Where are we?' cried Dollmann, starting up from the lee sofa, where\nhe seemed to have been lying in a sort of trance. A book, his own\nbook, slipped from his knees, and I saw the frontispiece lying on the\nfloor in a pool of oil; for the stove had gone adrift, and the saloon\nwas in a wretched state of squalor and litter.\n\n'Off Rottum,' I said, and knelt up to find the chart. There was a\nlook in his eyes that I suppose I ought to have understood, but I can\nscarcely blame myself, for the accumulated strain, not only of the\nlast three days and nights, but of the whole arduous month of my\ncruise with Davies, was beginning to tell on me, now that safety and\nsuccess were at hand. I handed up the chart through the companion,\nand then crept into the reeling fo'c'sle and lay down on the spare\nsail-bags, with the thunder and thump of the seas around and above\nme.\n\nI must quote Davies for the event that happened now; for by the time\nI had responded to the alarm and climbed up through the fore-hatch,\nthe whole tragedy was over and done with.\n\n'X---- came up the companion,' he says, 'soon after you went down. He\nheld on by the runner, and stared to windward at Rottum, as though he\nknew the place quite well. And then he came towards us, moving so\nunsteadily that I gave Clara the tiller, and went to help him. I\ntried to make him go down again, but he wouldn't, and came aft.\n\n\"'Give me the helm,\" he said, half to himself. \"Sea's too bad\noutside--there's a short cut here.\"\n\n\"'Thanks,\" I said, \"I know this one.\" (I don't think I meant to be\nsarcastic.) He said nothing, and settled himself on the counter\nbehind us, safe enough, with his feet against the lee-rail, and then,\nto my astonishment, began to talk over my shoulder jolly sensibly\nabout the course, pointing out a buoy which is wrong on the chart (as\nI knew), and telling me it was wrong, and so on. Well, we came to the\nbar of the Schild, and had to turn south for that twisty bit of\nbeating between Rottum and Bosch Flat. Clara was at the jib-sheet, I\nhad the chart and the tiller (you know how absent I get like that);\nthere was a bobble of sea, and we both had heaps to do, and--well--I\nhappened to look round, and he was gone. He hadn't spoken for a\nminute or two, but I believe the last thing I heard him say (I was\nhardly attending at the time, for we were in the thick of it) was\nsomething about a \"short cut\" again. He must have slipped over\nquietly ... He had an ulster and big boots on.'\n\nWe cruised about for a time, but never found him.\n\nThat evening, after threading the maze of shoals between the Dutch\nmainland and islands, we anchored off the little hamlet of Ostmahorn,\n_[See Map A]_ gave the yacht in charge of some astonished fishermen,\nand thence by road and rail, hurrying still, gained Harlingen, and\ntook passage on a steamer to London. From that point our personal\nhistory is of no concern to the outside world, and here, therefore, I\nbring this narrative to an end.\n\n\n\n\nEpilogue\n\nBY THE EDITOR\n\n[For this chapter see Map A.]\n\n\nAN interesting document, somewhat damaged by fire, lies on my study\ntable.\n\nIt is a copy (in cipher) of a confidential memorandum to the German\nGovernment embodying a scheme for the invasion of England by Germany.\nIt is unsigned, but internal evidence, and the fact that it was taken\nby Mr 'Carruthers' from the stove of the villa at Norderney, leave no\ndoubt as to its authorship. For many reasons it is out of the\nquestion to print the textual translation of it, as deciphered; but I\npropose to give an outline of its contents.\n\nEven this must strain discretion to its uttermost limits, and had I\nonly to consider the instructed few who follow the trend of\nprofessional opinion on such subjects, I should leave the foregoing\nnarrative to speak for itself. But, as was stated in the preface, our\nprimary purpose is to reach everyone; and there may be many who, in\nspite of able and authoritative warnings frequently uttered since\nthese events occurred, are still prone to treat the German danger as\nan idle 'bogey', and may be disposed, in this case, to imagine that a\nbaseless romance has been foisted on them.\n\nA few persons (English as well as German) hold that Germany is strong\nenough now to meet us single-handed, and throw an army on our shores.\nThe memorandum rejects this view, deferring isolated action for at\nleast a decade; and supposing, for present purposes, a coalition of\nthree Powers against Great Britain. And subsequent researches through\nthe usual channels place it beyond dispute that this condition was\nrelied on by the German Government in adopting the scheme. They\nrealized that even if, owing to our widely scattered forces, they\ngained that temporary command of the North Sea which would be\nessential for a successful landing, they would inevitably lose it\nwhen our standing fleets were concentrated and our reserve ships\nmobilized. With its sea-communications cut, the prospects of the\ninvading army would be too dubious. I state it in that mild way, for\nit seems not to have been held that failure was absolutely certain;\nand rightly, I think, in spite of the dogmas of the strategists--for\nthe ease transcends all experience. No man can calculate the effect\non our delicate economic fabric of a well-timed, well-planned blow at\nthe industrial heart of the kingdom, the great northern and midland\ntowns, with their teeming populations of peaceful wage-earners. In\nthis instance, however, joint action (the occasion for which is\nperhaps not difficult to guess) was distinctly contemplated, and\nGermany's _r\u00c3\u00b4le_ in the coalition was exclusively that of invader.\nHer fleet was to be kept intact, and she herself to remain ostensibly\nneutral until the first shock was over, and our own battle-fleets\neither beaten, or, the much more likely event, so crippled by a\nhard-won victory as to be incapable of withstanding compact and\nunscathed forces. Then, holding the balance of power, she would\nstrike. And the blow? It was not till I read this memorandum that I\ngrasped the full merits of that daring scheme, under which every\nadvantage, moral, material, and geographical, possessed by Germany,\nis utilized to the utmost, and every disadvantage of our own turned\nto account against us.\n\nTwo root principles pervade it: perfect organization; perfect\nsecrecy. Under the first head come some general considerations. The\nwriter (who is intimately conversant with conditions on both sides of\nthe North Sea) argued that Germany is pre-eminently fitted to\nundertake an invasion of Great Britain. She has a great army (a mere\nfraction of which would suffice) in a state of high efficiency, but a\nuseless weapon, as against us, unless transported over seas. She has\na peculiar genius for organization, not only in elaborating minute\ndetail, but in the grasp of a coherent whole. She knows the art of\ngiving a brain to a machine, of transmitting power to the uttermost\ncog-wheel, and at the same time of concentrating responsibility in a\nsupreme centre. She has a small navy, but very effective for its\npurpose, built, trained, and manned on methodical principles, for\ndefined ends, and backed by an inexhaustible reserve of men from her\nmaritime conscription. She studies and practises co-operation between\nher army and navy. Her hands are free for offence in home waters,\nsince she has no distant network of coveted colonies and dependencies\non which to dissipate her defensive energies. Finally, she is,\ncompared with ourselves, economically independent, having commercial\naccess through her land frontiers to the whole of Europe. She has\nlittle to lose and much to gain.\n\nThe writer pauses here to contrast our own situation, and I summarize\nhis points. We have a small army, dispersed over the whole globe, and\nadministered on a gravely defective system. We have no settled theory\nof national defence, and no competent authority whose business it is\nto give us one. The matter is still at the stage of civilian\ncontroversy. Co-operation between the army and navy is not studied\nand practised; much less do there exist any plans, worthy of the\nname, for the repulse of an invasion, or any readiness worth\nconsidering for the prompt equipment and direction of our home forces\nto meet a sudden emergency. We have a great and, in many respects, a\nmagnificent navy, but not great enough for the interests it insures,\nand with equally defective institutions; not built or manned\nmethodically, having an utterly inadequate reserve of men, all\nclasses of which would be absorbed at the very outset, without a\nvestige of preparation for the enrolment of volunteers; distracted by\nthe multiplicity of its functions in guarding our colossal empire and\ncommerce, and conspicuously lacking a brain, not merely for the\nsmooth control of its own unwieldy mechanism, but for the study of\nrival aims and systems. We have no North Sea naval base, no North Sea\nFleet, and no North Sea policy. Lastly, we stand in a highly\ndangerous economical position.\n\nThe writer then deals with the method of invasion, and rejects the\nobvious one at once, that of sending forth a fleet of transports from\none or more of the North Sea ports. He combats especially the idea of\nmaking Emden (the nearest to our shores) the port of departure. I\nmention this because, since his own scheme was adopted, it is\ninstructive to note that Emden had been used (with caution) as a red\nherring by the inspired German press, when the subject was mentioned\nat all, and industriously dragged across the trail. His objections to\nthe North Sea ports apply, he remarks, in reality to all schemes of\ninvasion, whether the conditions be favourable or not. One is that\nsecrecy is rendered impossible--and secrecy is vital. The collection\nof the transports would be known in England weeks before the hour was\nripe for striking; for all large ports are cosmopolitan and swarm\nwith potential spies. In Germany's case, moreover, suitable ships are\nnone too plentiful, and the number required would entail a large\ndeduction from her mercantile marine. The other reason concerns the\nactual landing. This must take place on an open part of the east\ncoast of England. No other objective is even considered. Now the\ndifficulty of transshipping and landing troops by boats from\ntransports anchored in deep water, in a safe, swift, and orderly\nfashion, on an open beach, is enormous. The most hastily improvised\nresistance might cause a humiliating disaster. Yet the first stage is\nthe most important of all. It is imperative that the invaders should\nseize and promptly intrench a pre-arranged line of country, to serve\nas an initial base. This once done, they can use other resources;\nthey can bring up transports, land cavalry and heavy guns, pour in\nstores, and advance. But unless this is done, they are impotent, be\ntheir sea-communications never so secure.\n\nThe only logical alternative is then propounded: to despatch an army\nof infantry with the lightest type of field-guns in big sea-going\nlighters, towed by powerful but shallow-draught tugs, under escort of\na powerful composite squadron of warships; and to fling the flotilla,\nat high tide, if possible, straight upon the shore.\n\nSuch an expedition could be prepared in absolute secrecy, by turning\nto account the natural features of the German coast. No great port\nwas to be concerned in any way. All that was required was sufficient\ndepth of water to float the lighters and tugs; and this is supplied\nby seven insignificant streams, issuing from the Frisian littoral,\nand already furnished with small harbours and sluice-gates, with one\nexception, namely, the tidal creek at Norden; for this, it appeared,\nwas one of the chosen seven, and not, as 'Carruthers' supposed,\nHilgenriedersiel, which, if you remember, he had no time to visit,\nand which has, in fact, no stream of any value at all, and no\nharbour. All of these streams would have to be improved, deepened,\nand generally canalized; ostensibly with a commercial end, for\npurposes of traffic with the islands, which are growing health\nresorts during a limited summer season.\n\nThe whole expedition would be organized under seven distinct\nsub-divisions--not too great a number in view of its cumbrous\ncharacter. Seawards, the whole of the coast is veiled by the fringe\nof islands and the zone of shoals. Landwards, the loop of railway\nround the Frisian peninsula would form the line of communication in\nrear of the seven streams. Esens was to be the local centre of\nadministration when the scheme grew to maturity, but not till then.\nEvery detail for the movement of troops under the seven different\nheads was to be arranged for with secrecy and exactitude many months\nin advance, and from headquarters at Berlin. It was not expected that\nnothing would leak out, but care was to be taken that anything that\ndid do so should be attributed to defensive measures--a standing\nfeature in German mobilization being the establishment of a corps of\nobservation along the Frisian coast; in fact, the same machinery was\nto be used, and its conversion for offence concealed up to the latest\npossible moment. The same precautions were to be taken in the\npreliminary work on the spot. There, four men only (it was\ncalculated) need be in full possession of the secret. One was to\nrepresent the Imperial Navy (a post filled by our friend von\nBr\u00c3\u00bcning). Another (B\u00c3\u00b6hme) was to superintend the six canals and the\nconstruction of the lighters. The functions of the third were\ntwofold. He was to organize what I may call the local labour--that\nis, the helpers required for embarkation, the crews of the tugs, and,\nmost important of all, the service of pilots for the navigation of\nthe seven flotillas through the corresponding channels to the open\nsea. He must be a local man, thoroughly acquainted with the coast, of\na social standing not much above the average of villagers and\nfishermen, and he must be ready when the time was ripe with lists of\nthe right men for the right duties, lists to which the conscription\nauthorities could when required, give instant legal effect. His other\nfunction was to police the coast for spies, and to report anything\nsuspicious to von Br\u00c3\u00bcning, who would never be far away. On the whole\nI think that they found the grim Grimm a jewel for their purpose.\n\nAs fourth personage, the writer designates himself, the promoter of\nthe scheme, the indispensable link between the two nations. He\nundertakes to furnish reliable information as to the disposition of\ntroops in England, as to the hydrography of the coast selected for\nthe landing, as to the supplies available in its vicinity, and the\nstrategic points to be seized. He proposes to be guide-in-chief to\nthe expedition during transit. And in the meantime (when not\notherwise employed) he was to reside at Norderney, in close touch\nwith the other three, and controlling the commercial undertakings\nwhich were to throw dust in the eyes of the curious. [Memmert, by the\nway, is not mentioned in this memorandum.]\n\nHe speaks of the place 'selected for the landing', and proceeds to\nconsider this question in detail. I cannot follow him in his review,\ndeeply interesting though it is, and shall say at once that he\nreduces possible landing-places to two, the flats on the Essex coast\nbetween Foulness and Brightlingsea, and the Wash--with a decided\npreference for the latter. Assuming that the enemy, if they got wind\nof an invasion at all, would expect transports to be employed, he\nchooses the sort of spot which they would be least likely to defend,\nand which, nevertheless, was suitable to the character of the\nflotillas, and similar to the region they started from. There is such\na spot on the Lincolnshire coast, on the north side of the Wash,\n_[See Map A]_ known as East Holland. It is low-lying land, dyked\nagainst the sea, and bordered like Frisia with sand-flats which dry\noff at low water. It is easy of access from the east, by way of\nBoston Deeps, a deep-water channel formed by a detached bank, called\nthe Long Sand, lying parallel to the shore for ten miles. This bank\nmakes a natural breakwater against the swell from the east (the only\nquarter to be feared); and the Deeps behind it, where there is an\naverage depth of thirty-four feet at low-water, would form an\nexcellent roadstead for the covering squadron, whose guns would\ncommand the shore within easy range. It is noted in passing that this\nis just the case where German first-class battleships would have an\nadvantage over British ships of the same calibre. The latter are of\njust too heavy a draught to navigate such waters without peril, if,\nindeed, they could enter this roadstead at all, for there is a bar at\nthe mouth of it with only thirty-one feet at high water, spring\ntides. The former, built as they were with a view to manoeuvring in\nthe North Sea, are just within the margin of safety. East Holland is\nwithin easy striking distance of the manufacturing districts, a\nvigorous raid on which is, the writer urges, the true policy of an\ninvader. He reports positively that there exist (in a proper military\nsense) no preparations whatever to meet such an attack. East Holland\nis also the nearest point on the British shores to Germany, excepting\nthe coast of Norfolk; much nearer, indeed, than the Essex flats\nalluded to, and reached by a simple deep-sea passage, without any\ndangerous region to navigate, like the mouth of the Channel and the\nestuary of the Thames from Harwich westwards. The distance is 240\nsea-miles, west by south roughly, from Borkum Island, and 280 from\nWangeroog. The time estimated for transit after the flotillas had\nbeen assembled outside the islands is from thirty to thirty-four\nhours.\n\nEmbarkation is the next topic. This could and must be effected in one\ntide. At the six _siels_ there was a mean period of two and a half\nhours in every twelve, during which the water was high enough. At\nNorden a rather longer time was available. But this should be amply\nsufficient if the machinery were in good working order and were\npunctually set in motion. High water occurs approximately at the same\ntime at all seven outlets, the difference between the two farthest\napart, Carolinensiel and Greetsiel, being only half an hour.\n\nLastly, the special risks attendant on such an expedition are\ndispassionately weighed. X----, though keenly anxious to recommend his\nscheme, writes in no blindly sanguine spirit. There are no modern\nprecedents for any invasion in the least degree comparable to that of\nEngland by Germany. Any such attempt will be a hazardous experiment.\nBut he argues that the advantages of his method outweigh the risks,\nand that most of the risks themselves would attach equally to any\nother method. Whatever skill in prediction was used, bad weather\nmight overtake the expedition. Yes; but if transports were used\ntranshipment into boats for landing would in bad weather be fraught\nwith the same and a greater peril. But transports could stand off and\nwait. Delay is fatal in any case; unswerving promptitude is the\nessence of such an enterprise. The lighters would be in danger of\nfoundering? Beside the point; if the end is worth gaining the risks\nmust be faced. Soldiers' lives are sacrificed in tens of thousands on\nbattlefields. The flotilla would be demoralized during transit by the\nassault of a few torpedo-boats? Granted; but the same would apply to\na fleet of transports, with the added certainty that one lucky shot\nwould send to the bottom ten times the number of soldiers, with less\nhope of rescue. In both cases reliance must be placed on the\nefficiency and vigilance of the escort. It is admitted, however, in a\npassage which might well make my two adventurers glow with triumph,\nthat if by any mischance the British discovered what was afoot in\ngood time, and were able to send over a swarm of light-draught boats,\nwhich could elude the German warships and get amongst the flotillas\nwhile they were still in process of leaving the siels; it is admitted\nthat in that case the expedition was doomed. But it is held that such\nan event was not to be feared. Reckless pluck is abundant in the\nBritish Navy, but expert knowledge of the tides and shoals in these\nwaters is utterly lacking. The British charts are of no value, and\nthere is no evidence (he reports) that the subject has been studied\nin any way by the British Admiralty. Let me remark here, that I\nbelieve Mr 'Davies's' views, as expressed in the earlier chapters,\nwhen they were still among the great estuaries, are all absolutely\nsound. The 'channel theory', though it only bore indirectly on the\ngrand issue before them, was true, and should be laid to heart, or I\nshould not have wasted space on it.\n\nOne word more, in conclusion. There is an axiom, much in fashion now,\nthat there is no fear of an invasion of the British Isles, because if\nwe lose command of the sea, we can be starved--a cheaper and surer\nway of reducing us to submission. It is a loose, valueless axiom, but\nby sheer repetition it is becoming an article of faith. It implies\nthat 'command of the sea' is a thing to be won or lost definitely;\nthat we may have it to-day and lose it for ever to-morrow. On the\ncontrary, the chances are that in anything like an even struggle the\ncommand of the sea will hang in the balance for an indefinite time.\nAnd even against great odds, it would probably be impossible for our\nenemies so to bar the avenues of our commerce, so to blockade the\nports of our extensive coast-line, and so to overcome the interest\nwhich neutrals will have in supplying us, as to bring us to our knees\nin less than two years, during which time we can be recuperating and\nrebuilding from our unique internal resources, and endeavouring to\nregain command.\n\nNo; the better axiom is that nothing short of a successful invasion\ncould finally compel us to make peace. Our hearts are stout, we hope;\nbut facts are facts; and a successful raid, such as that here\nsketched, if you will think out its consequences, must appal the\nstoutest heart. It was checkmated, but others may be conceived. In\nany case, we know the way in which they look at these things in\nGermany.\n\n\n\n\nPostscript (March 1903)\n\n\nIT so happens that while this book was in the press a number of\nmeasures have been taken by the Government to counteract some of the\nvery weaknesses and dangers which are alluded to above. A Committee\nof National Defence has been set up, and the welcome given to it was\na truly extraordinary comment on the apathy and confusion which it is\ndesigned to supplant. A site on the Forth has been selected for a new\nNorth Sea naval base--an excellent if tardy decision; for ten years\nor so must elapse before the existing anchorage becomes in any sense\na 'base'. A North Sea fleet has also been created--another good\nmeasure; but it should be remembered that its ships are not modern,\nor in the least capable of meeting the principal German squadrons\nunder the circumstances supposed above.\n\nLastly, a Manning Committee has (among other matters) reported\nvaguely in favour of a Volunteer Reserve. There is no means of\nknowing what this recommendation will lead to; let us hope not to the\nfiasco of the last badly conceived experiment. Is it not becoming\npatent that the time has come for training all Englishmen\nsystematically either for the sea or for the rifle?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Riddle of the Sands, by Erskine Childers\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE RIDDLE OF THE SANDS ***\n\n***** This file should be named 2360-8.txt or 2360-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/2\/3\/6\/2360\/\n\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp:\/\/pglaf.org\/fundraising.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":327,"split":"train"}
