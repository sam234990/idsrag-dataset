He intends to marry his sister Panthea to Tigranes. Meanwhile, he learns that his mother, Arane, who hates him, has plotted his assassination. The regent Gobrius has foiled the plot. Tigranes' fiancee Spaconia accompanies him into exile, hoping to avert Arbaces' plans for the marriage alliance. Tigranes promises her he will remain faithful.\nOn his return Arbaces finds that he now has a powerful sexual attraction to his beautiful sister, the princess Panthea, whom he hasn't seen since childhood. Much of the play depicts his increasingly desperate struggle against his incestuous passion. Arbaces blames the protector Gobrius for his predicament; the minister had written Arbaces many letters during the king's years abroad, praising Panthea's beauty and her love for him. Panthea is also attracted to Arbaces, but her virtue restains them both. The king becomes so desperate that he decides to murder Gobrius, rape Panthea, and then commit suicide. Meanwhile, Tigranes too falls in love with Panthea, even though this means he breaks his faith with Spaconia. Tigranes exercises the self-discipline and rationality that Arbaces struggles to achieve, and rededicates himself to Spaconia.\nArbaces' dilemma is resolved when it is revealed that the situation is a complex hoax, staged by Arane and Gobrius to give an heir to the childless old king who was Arbaces' predecessor. Arane's plots against her supposed son were intended to restore the rightful succession. Arbaces is in fact Gobrius's son, and so Panthea is not actually his sister. Gobrius had plotted that his son would become the legitimate king, by marriage with Panthea; Arbaces does marry the princess, but steps down from the kingship.\nArbaces is presented as a mixed character, brave and formidable in battle, but boastful and somewhat vulgar. His character is explained by the trick of his birth: he cannot behave with the nobility of a king, because he isn't one by \"blood.\" The comic relief in the play is provided by the cowardly Bessus and his cronies; their subplot turns on the customs of honorable duelling \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and their comical violation. (Bessus was a well-known comic creation; Queen Henrietta Maria refers to Bessus in a 25 February 1643 letter to her husband, Charles I.)\nA King and No King has a strong degree of commonality with the same authors' Thierry and Theodoret. The former might be regarded as the tragicomic version, and the latter the tragic, of the same story.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of A King, and No King\nby Francis Beaumont and John Fletcher\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

I, I warrant you.\n\n_Mar_.\n\n  I'me e'en heartily glad on't, I have been with thee e're since\n  thou cam'st to th'wars, and this is the first word that ever I\n  heard on't, prethee who fames thee.\n\n_Bes_.\n\n  The Christian world.\n\n_Mar_.\n\n  'Tis heathenishly done of'em in my conscience, thou deserv'st it\n  not.\n\n_Bes_.\n\n  Yes, I ha' don good service.\n\n_Mar_.\n\n  I do not know how thou mayst wait of a man in's Chamber, or thy\n  agility of shifting of a Trencher, but otherwise no service good\n  _Bessus_.\n\n_Bes_.\n\n  You saw me do the service your self.\n\n_Mar_.\n\n  Not so hasty sweet _Bessus_, where was it, is the place\nvanish'd?\n\n_Bes_.\n\n  At _Bessus_  desp'rate redemption.\n\n_Mar_.\n\n  At _Bessus_  desp'rate redemption, where's that?\n\n_Bes_.\n\n  There where I redeem'd the day, the place bears my name.\n\n_Mar_.\n\n  Pray thee, who Christened it?\n\n_Bes_.\n\n  The Souldiers.\n\n_Mar_.\n\n  If I were not a very merrily dispos'd man, what would become of\n  thee? one that had but a grain of choler in the whole composition\n  of his body, would send thee of an errand to the worms for\n  putting thy name upon that field: did not I beat thee there i'th'\n  head o'th' Troops with a Trunchion, because thou wouldst needs\n  run away with thy company, when we should charge the enemy?\n\n_Bes_.\n\n  True, but I did not run.\n\n_Mar_.\n\n  Right _Bessus_, I beat thee out on't.\n\n_Bes_.\n\n  But came I not up when the day was gone, and redeem'd\nall?\n\n_Mar_.\n\n  Thou knowest, and so do I, thou meanedst to flie, and thy fear\n  making thee mistake, thou ranst upon the enemy, and a hot charge\n  thou gav'st, as I'le do thee right, thou art furious in running\n  away, and I think, we owe thy fear for our victory; If I were the\n  King, and were sure thou wouldst mistake alwaies and run away\n  upon th' enemy, thou shouldst be General by this light.\n\n_Bes_.\n\n  You'l never leave this till I fall foul.\n\n_Mar_.\n\n  No more such words dear _Bessus_, for though I have ever known\n  thee a coward, and therefore durst never strike thee, yet if thou\n  proceedest, I will allow thee valiant, and beat thee.\n\n_Bes_.\n\n  Come, our King's a brave fellow.\n\n_Mar_.\n\n  He is so _Bessus_, I wonder how thou cam'st to know it. But if\n  thou wer't a man of understanding, I would tell thee, he is\n  vain-glorious, and humble, and angry, and patient, and merry and\n  dull, and joyful and sorrowful in extremity in an hour: Do not\n  think me thy friend for this, for if I ear'd who knew it, thou\n  shouldst not hear it _Bessus_.

They that plac'd me here,\n  Intended it an honour large enough, (though he\n  For the most valiant living, but to dare oppose me single,\n  Lost the day. What should afflict you, you are as free as I,\n  To be my prisoner, is to be more free\n  Than you were formerly, and never think\n  The man I held worthy to combate me\n  Shall be us'd servilely: Thy ransom is\n  To take my only Sister to thy Wife.\n  A heavy one _Tigranes_, for she is\n  A Lady, that the neighbour Princes send\n  Blanks to fetch home. I have been too unkind\n  To her _Tigranes_, she but nine years old\n  I left her, and ne're saw her since, your wars\n  Have held me long and taught me though a youth,\n  The way to victory, she was a pretty child,\n  Then I was little better, but now fame\n  Cries loudly on her, and my messengers\n  Make me believe she is a miracle;\n  She'l make you shrink, as I did, with a stroak\n  But of her eye _Tigranes_.\n\n_Tigr_.\n\n  Is't the course of _Iberia_  to use their prisoners thus?\n  Had fortune thrown my name above _Arbace_,\n  I should not thus have talk'd Sir, in _Armenia_\n  We hold it base, you should have kept your temper\n  Till you saw home again, where 'tis the fashion\n  Perhaps to brag.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  Be you my witness earth, need I to brag,\n  Doth not this captive Prince speak\n  Me sufficiently, and all the acts\n  That I have wrought upon his suffering Land;\n  Should I then boast! where lies that foot of ground\n  Within his whole Realm, that I have not past,\n  Fighting and conquering; Far then from me\n  Be ostentation. I could tell the world\n  How I have laid his Kingdom desolate\n  By this sole Arm prop't by divinity,\n  Stript him out of his glories, and have sent\n  The pride of all his youth to people graves,\n  And made his Virgins languish for their Loves,\n  If I would brag, should I that have the power\n  To teach the Neighbour world humility,\n  Mix with vain-glory?\n\n_Mar_.\n\n  Indeed this is none.\n\n_Arb.\n\n  _Tigranes_, Nay did I but take delight\n  To stretch my deeds as others do, on words,\n  I could amaze my hearers.\n\n_Mar_.\n\nSo you do.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  But he shall wrong his and my modesty,\n  That thinks me apt to boast after any act\n  Fit for a good man to do upon his foe.\n  A little glory in a souldiers mouth\n  Is well-becoming, be it far from vain.\n\n_Mar_.\n\n  'Tis pity that valour should be thus drunk.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  I offer you my Sister, and you answer\n  I do insult, a Lady that no suite\n  Nor treasure, nor thy Crown could purchase thee,\n  But that thou fought'st with me.\n\n_Tigr_.\n\n  Though this be worse\n  Than that you spake before, it strikes me not;\n  But that you think to overgrace me with\n  The marriage of your Sister, troubles me.\n  I would give worlds for ransoms were they mine,\n  Rather than have her.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  See if I insult\n  That am the Conquerour, and for a ransom\n  Offer rich treasure to the Conquered,\n  Which he refuses, and I bear his scorn:\n  It cannot be self-flattery to say,\n  The Daughters of your Country set by her,\n  Would see their shame, run home and blush to death,\n  At their own foulness; yet she is not fair,\n  Nor beautiful, those words express her not,\n  They say her looks have something excellent,\n  That wants a name: yet were she odious,\n  Her birth deserves the Empire of the world,\n  Sister to such a brother, that hath ta'ne\n  Victory prisoner, and throughout the earth,\n  Carries her bound, and should he let her loose,\n  She durst not leave him; Nature did her wrong,\n  To Print continual conquest on her cheeks,\n  And make no man worthy for her to taste\n  But me that am too near her, and as strangely\n  She did for me, but you will think I brag.\n\n_Mar_.\n\n  I do I'le be sworn. Thy valour and thy passions sever'd, would\n  have made two excellent fellows in their kinds: I know not\n  whether I should be sorry thou art so valiant, or so passionate,\n  wou'd one of 'em were away.\n\n_Tigr_.\n\n  Do I refuse her that I doubt her worth?\n  Were she as vertuous as she would be thought,\n  So perfect that no one of her own sex\n  Could find a want, had she so tempting fair,\n  That she could wish it off for damning souls,\n  I would pay any ransom, twenty lives\n  Rather than meet her married in my bed.\n  Perhaps I have a love, where I have fixt\n  Mine eyes not to be mov'd, and she on me,\n  I am not fickle.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  Is that all the cause?\n  Think you, you can so knit your self in love\n  To any other, that her searching sight\n  Cannot dissolve it? So before you tri'd,\n  You thought your self a match for me in [f]ight,\n  Trust me _Tigranes_, she can do as much\n  In peace, as I in war, she'l conquer too,\n  You shall see if you have the power to stand\n  The force of her swift looks, if you dislike,\n  I'le send you home with love, and name your ransom\n  Some other way, but if she be your choice,\n  She frees you: To _Iberia_  you must.\n\n_Tigr_.\n\n  Sir, I have learn'd a prisoners sufferance,\n  And will obey, but give me leave to talk\n  In private with some friends before I go.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  Some to await him forth, and see him safe,\n  But let him freely send for whom he please,\n  And none dare to disturb his conference,\n  I will not have him know what bondage is,\n\n                                           [_Exit Tigranes_.\n\n  Till he be free from me. This Prince, _Mardonius_,\n  Is full of wisdom, valour, all the graces\n  Man can receive.\n\n_Mar_.\n\n   And yet you conquer'd him.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  And yet I conquer'd him, and could have don't\n  Hadst thou joyn'd with him, though thy name in Arms\n  Be great; must all men that are vertuous\n  Think suddenly to match themselves with me?\n  I conquered him and bravely, did I not?\n\n_Bes_.\n\n  And please your Majesty, I was afraid at first.\n\n_Mar_.\n\n   When wert thou other?\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  Of what?\n\n_Bes_.\n\n  That you would not have spy'd your best advantages, for your\n  Majesty in my opinion lay too high, methinks, under favour, you\n  should have lain thus.\n\n_Mar_.\n\n  Like a Taylor at a wake.\n\n_Bes_.\n\n  And then, if please your Majesty to remember, at one time, by my\n  troth I wisht my self wi'you.\n\n_Mar_.\n\n  By my troth thou wouldst ha' stunk 'em both out o'th' Lists.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  What to do?\n\n_Bes_.\n\n  To put your Majesty in mind of an occasion; you lay thus, and\n  _Tigranes_  falsified a blow at your Leg, which you by doing thus\n  avoided; but if you had whip'd up your Leg thus, and reach'd him\n  on the ear, you had made the Blood-Royal run down his head.\n\n_Mar_.\n\n  What Country Fence-school learn'st thou at?\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  Pish, did not I take him nobly?\n\n_Mar_.\n\n  Why you did, and you have talked enough on't.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  Talkt enough?\n  Will you confine my word? by heaven and earth,\n  I were much better be a King of beasts\n  Than such a people: if I had not patience\n  Above a God, I should be call'd a Tyrant\n  Throughout the world. They will offend to death\n  Each minute: Let me hear thee speak again,\n  And thou art earth again: why this is like\n  _Tigranes_  speech that needs would say I brag'd.\n  _Bessus_, he said I brag'd.\n\n_Bes_.\n\n  Ha, ha, ha.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  Why dost thou laugh?\n  By all the world, I'm grown ridiculous\n  To my own Subjects: Tie me in a Chair\n  And jest at me, but I shall make a start,\n  And punish some that others may take heed\n  How they are haughty; who will answer me?\n  He said I boasted, speak _Mardonius_,\n  Did I? He will not answer, O my temper!\n  I give you thanks above, that taught my heart\n  Patience, I can endure his silence; what will none\n  Vouchsafe to give me answer? am I grown\n  To such a poor respect, or do you mean\n  To break my wind? Speak, speak, some one of you,\n  Or else by heaven.\n\n_1 Gent_.\n\n  So please your.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  Monstrous,\n  I cannot be heard out, they cut me off,\n  As if I were too saucy, I will live\n  In woods, and talk to trees, they will allow me\n  To end what I begin. The meanest Subject\n  Can find a freedom to discharge his soul\n  And not I, now it is a time to speak,\n  I hearken.\n\n_1 Gent_.\n\n  May it please.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  I mean not you,\n  Did not I stop you once? but I am grown\n  To balk, but I defie, let another speak.\n\n_2 Gent_.\n\n  I hope your Majesty.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  Thou drawest thy words,\n  That I must wait an hour, where other men\n  Can hear in instants; throw your words away,\n  Quick, and to purpose, I have told you this.\n\n_Bes_.\n\n  And please your Majesty.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  Wilt thou devour me? this is such a rudeness\n  As you never shew'd me, and I want\n  Power to command too, else _Mardonius_\n  Would speak at my request; were you my King,\n  I would have answered at your word _Mardonius_,\n  I pray you speak, and truely, did I boast?\n\n_Mar_.\n\nTruth will offend you.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  You take all great care what will offend me,\n  When you dare to utter such things as these.\n\n_Mar_.\n\n  You told _Tigranes_, you had won his Land,\n  With that sole arm propt by Divinity:\n  Was not that bragging, and a wrong to us,\n  That daily ventured lives?\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  O that thy name\n  Were as great, as mine, would I had paid my wealth,\n  It were as great, as I might combate thee,\n  I would through all the Regions habitable\n  Search thee, and having found thee, wi'my Sword\n  Drive thee about the world, till I had met\n  Some place that yet mans curiosity\n  Hath mist of; there, there would I strike thee dead:\n  Forgotten of mankind, such Funeral rites\n  As beasts would give thee, thou shouldst have.\n\n_Bes_.\n\n  The King rages extreamly, shall we slink away? He'l strike us.\n\n_2 Gent_.\n\n  Content.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  There I would make you know 'twas this sole arm.\n  I grant you were my instruments, and did\n  As I commanded you, but 'twas this arm\n  Mov'd you like wheels, it mov'd you as it pleas'd.\n  Whither slip you now? what are you too good\n  To wait on me (_puffe_,) I had need have temper\n  That rule such people; I have nothing left\n  At my own choice, I would I might be private:\n  Mean men enjoy themselves, but 'tis our curse,\n  To have a tumult that out of their loves\n  Will wait on us, whether we will or no;\n  Go get you gone: Why here they stand like death,\n  My words move nothing.\n\n_1 Gent_.\n\n  Must we go?\n\n_Bes_. I know not.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  I pray you leave me Sirs, I'me proud of this,\n  That you will be intreated from my sight:\n  Why now the[y] leave me all: _Mardonius_.\n\n\n                      [_Exeunt all but_  Arb. _and_  Mar.\n\n_Mar_.\n\n  Sir.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  Will you leave me quite alone? me thinks\n  Civility should teach you more than this,\n  If I were but your friend: Stay here and wait.\n\n_Mar_.\n\n  Sir shall I speak?\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  Why, you would now think much\n  To be denied, but I can scar[c]e intreat\n  What I would have: do, speak.\n\n_Mar_.\n\n  But will you hear me out?\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  With me you Article to talk thus: well,\n  I will hear you out.\n\n_Mar_.\n\n  Sir, that I have ever lov'd you, my sword hath spoken for me;\n  that I do, if it be doubted, I dare call an oath, a great one to\n  my witness; and were you not my King, from amongst men, I should\n  have chose you out to love above the rest: nor can this challenge\n  thanks, for my own sake I should have done it, because I would\n  have lov'd the most deserving man, for so you are.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  Alas _Mardonius_, rise you shall not kneel,\n  We all are souldiers, and all venture lives:\n  And where there is no difference in mens worths,\n  Titles are jests, who can outvalue thee?\n  _Mardonius_  thou hast lov'd me, and hast wrong,\n  Thy love is not rewarded, but believe\n  It shall be better, more than friend in arms,\n  My Father, and my Tutor, good _Mardonius_.\n\n_Mar_.\n\n  Sir, you did promise you would hear me out.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  And so I will; speak freely, for from thee\n  Nothing can come but worthy things and true.\n\n_Mar_.\n\n  Though you have all this worth, you hold some qualities that do\n  Eclipse your vertues.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  Eclipse my vertues?\n\n_Mar_.\n\n  Yes, your passions, which are so manifold, that they appear even\n  in this: when I commend you, you hug me for that truth: but when\n  I speak your faults, you make a start, and flie the hearing but.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  When you commend me? O that I should live\n  To need such commendations: If my deeds\n  Blew not my praise themselves about the earth,\n  I were most wretched: spare your idle praise:\n  If thou didst mean to flatter, and shouldst utter\n  Words in my praise, that thou thoughtst impudence,\n  My deeds should make 'em modest: when you praise I hug\n  you? 'tis so [false], that wert thou worthy thou shouldst receive\n  a death, a glorious death from me: but thou shalt understand\n  thy lies, for shouldst thou praise me into Heaven, and there\n  leave me inthron'd, I would despise thee though as much as\n  now, which is as much as dust because I see thy envie.\n\n_Mar_.\n\n  However you will use me after, yet for your own promise sake,\n  hear me the rest.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  I will, and after call unto the winds, for they shall lend as\n  large an ear as I to what you utter: speak.\n\n_Mar_.\n\n  Would you but leave these hasty tempers, which\n  I do not say take from you all your worth, but darken 'em,\n  then you will shine indeed.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  Well.\n\n_Mar_.\n\n  Yet I would have you keep some passions, lest men should take you\n  for a God, your vertues are such.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  Why now you flatter.\n\n_Mar_.\n\n  I never understood the word, were you no King, and free from\n  these moods, should I choose a companion for wit and pleasure, it\n  should be you; or for honesty to enterchange my bosom with, it\n  should be you; or wisdom to give me counsel, I would pick out\n  you; or valour to defend my reputation, still I should find you\n  out; for you are fit to fight for all the world, if it could come\n  in question: Now I have spoke, consider to your self, find out a\n  use; if so, then what shall fall to me is not material.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  Is not material? more than ten such lives, as mine, _Mardonius_:\n  it was nobly said, thou hast spoke truth, and boldly such a truth\n  as might offend another. I have been too passionate and idle,\n  thou shalt see a swift amendment, but I want those parts you\n  praise me for: I fight for all the world? Give me a sword, and\n  thou wilt go as far beyond me, as thou art beyond in years, I\n  know thou dar'st and wilt; it troubles me that I should use so\n  rough a phrase to thee, impute it to my folly, what thou wilt, so\n  thou wilt par[d]on me: that thou and I should differ thus!\n\n_Mar_.\n\nWhy 'tis no matter Sir.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  Faith but it is, but thou dost ever take all things I do, thus\n  patiently, for which I never can requite thee, but with love, and\n  that thou shalt be sure of. Thou and I have not been merry\n  lately: pray thee tell me where hadst thou that same jewel in\n  thine ear?\n\n_Mar_.\n\n  Why at the taking of a Town.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  A wench upon my life, a wench _Mardonius_  gave thee that jewel.\n\n_Mar_.\n\n  Wench! they respect not me, I'm old and rough, and every limb\n  about me, but that which should, grows stiffer, I'those\n  businesses I may swear I am truly honest: for I pay justly for\n  what I take, and would be glad to be at a certainty.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  Why, do the wenches encroach upon thee?\n\n_Mar_.\n\n  I by this light do they.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  Didst thou sit at an old rent with 'em?\n\n_Mar_.\n\n  Yes faith.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  And do they improve themselves?\n\n_Mar_.\n\n  I ten shillings to me, every new young fellow they come\n  acquainted with.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  How canst live on't?\n\n_Mar_.\n\n  Why I think I must petition to you.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  Thou shalt take them up at my price.\n\n_Enter two Gentlemen and_  Bessus.\n\n_Mar_.\n\n  Your price?\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  I at the Kings price.\n\n_Mar_.\n\n  That may be more than I'me worth.\n\n_2 Gent_.\n\n  Is he not merry now?\n\n_1 Gent_.\n\n  I think not.\n\n_Bes_.\n\n  He is, he is: we'l shew our selves.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  Bessus, I thought you had been in _Iberia_  by this, I bad you\n  hast; _Gobrias_  will want entertainment for me.\n\n_Bes_.\n\n  And please your Majesty I have a sute.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  Is't not lousie _Bessus_, what is't?\n\n_Bes_.\n\n  I am to carry a Lady with me.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  Then thou hast two sutes.\n\n_Bes_.\n\n  And if I can prefer her to the Lady _Pentha_  your Majesties\n  Sister, to learn fashions, as her friends term it, it will be\n  worth something to me.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  So many nights lodgings as 'tis thither, wilt not?\n\n_Bes_.\n\n  I know not that Sir, but gold I shall be sure of.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  Why thou shalt bid her entertain her from me, so thou wilt\n  resolve me one thing.\n\n_Bes_.\n\n  If I can.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  Faith 'tis a very disputable question, and yet I think thou canst\n  decide it.\n\n_Bes_.\n\n  Your Majesty has a good opinion of my understanding.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  I have so good an opinion of it: 'tis whether thou be valiant.\n\n_Bes_.\n\n  Some body has traduced me to you: do you see this sword Sir?\n\n_Arb_.\n\nYes.\n\n_Bes_.\n\n  If I do not make my back-biters eat it to a knife within this\n  week, say I am not valiant.\n\n_Enter a Messenger_.\n\n_Mes_.\n\n  Health to your Majesty.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  From Gobrias?\n\n_Mes_.\n\n  Yes Sir.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  How does he, is he well?\n\n_Mes_.\n\n  In perfect health.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  Take that for thy good news.

I can see\n  No other here, but that petitioning Lady.\n\n_Gob_.\n\n  That's she.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  Away.\n\n_Gob_.\n\n  Sir, it is she.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  'Tis false.\n\n_Gob_.\n\n  Is it?\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  As hell, by Heaven, as false as hell,\n  My Sister: is she dead? if it be so,\n  Speak boldly to me; for I am a man,\n  And dare not quarrel with Divinity;\n  And do not think to cozen me with this:\n  I see you all are mute and stand amaz'd,\n  Fearful to answer me; it is too true,\n  A decreed instant cuts off ev'ry life,\n  For which to mourn, is to repine; she dy'd\n  A Virgin, though more innocent than sheep,\n  As clear as her own eyes, and blessedness\n  Eternal waits upon her where she is:\n  I know she could not make a wish to change\n  Her state for new, and you shall see me bear\n  My crosses like a man; we all must die,\n  And she hath taught us how.\n\n_Gob_.\n\n  Do not mistake,\n  And vex your self for nothing; for her death\n  Is a long life off, I hope: 'Tis she,\n  And if my speech deserve not faith, lay death\n  Upon me, and my latest words shall force\n  A credit from you.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  Which, good Gobrias? that Lady dost thou mean?\n\n_Gob_.\n\n  That Lady Sir,\n  She is your Sister, and she is your Sister\n  That loves you so, 'tis she for whom I weep,\n  To see you use her thus.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  It cannot be.\n\n_Tigr_.\n\n  Pish, this is tedious,\n  I cannot hold, I must present my self,\n  And yet the sight of my _Spaconia_\n  Touches me, as a sudden thunder-clap\n  Does one that is about to sin.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  Away,\n  No more of this; here I pronounce him Traytor,\n  The direct plotter of my death, that names\n  Or thinks her for my Sister, 'tis a lie,\n  The most malicious of the world, invented\n  To mad your King; he that will say so next,\n  Let him draw out his sword and sheath it here,\n  It is a sin fully as pardonable:\n  She is no kin to me, nor shall she be;\n  If she were ever, I create her none:\n  And which of you can question this? My power\n  Is like the Sea, that is to be obey'd,\n  And not disputed with: I have decreed her\n  As far from having part of blood with me,\n  As the nak'd _indians_; come and answer me,\n  He that is boldest now; is that my Sister?\n\n_Mar_.\n\n  O this is fine.\n\n_Bes_.\n\n  No marry, she is not, an't please your Majesty,\n  I never thought she was, she's nothing like you.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  No 'tis true, she is not.\n\n_Mar_.\n\n  Thou shou'dst be hang'd.\n\n_Pan_.\n\n  Sir, I will speak but once; by the same power\n  You make my blood a stranger unto yours,\n  You may command me dead, and so much love\n  A stranger may importune, pray you do;\n  If this request appear too much to grant,\n  Adopt me of some other Family,\n  By your unquestion'd word; else I shall live\n  Like sinfull issues that are left in streets\n  By their regardless Mothers, and no name\n  Will be found for me.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  I will hear no more,\n  Why should there be such musick in a voyce,\n  And sin for me to hear it? All the world\n  May take delight in this, and 'tis damnation\n  For me to do so: You are fair and wise\n  And vertuous I think, and he is blest\n  That is so near you as my brother is;\n  But you are nought to me but a disease;\n  Continual torment without hope of ease;\n  Such an ungodly sickness I have got,\n  That he that undertakes my cure, must first\n  O'rethrow Divinity, all moral Laws,\n  And leave mankind as unconfin'd as beasts,\n  Allowing 'em to do all actions\n  As freely as they drink when they desire.\n  Let me not hear you speak again; yet see\n  I shall but lang[u]ish for the want of that,\n  The having which, would kill me: No man here\n  Offer to speak for her; for I consider\n  As much as you can say; I will not toil\n  My body and my mind too, rest thou there,\n  Here's one within will labour for you both.\n\n_Pan_.\n\n  I would I were past speaking.\n\n_Gob_.\n\n  Fear not Madam,\n  The King will alter, 'tis some sudden rage,\n  And you shall see it end some other way.\n\n_Pan_.\n\n  Pray heaven it do.\n\n_Tig_.\n\n  Though she to whom I swore, be here, I cannot\n  Stifle my passion longer; if my father\n  Should rise again disquieted with this,\n  And charge me to forbear, yet it would out.\n  Madam, a stranger, and a pris'ner begs\n  To be bid welcome.\n\n_Pan_.\n\n  You are welcome, Sir,\n  I think, but if you be not, 'tis past me\n  To make you so: for I am here a stranger,\n  Greater than you; we know from whence you come,\n  But I appear a lost thing, and by whom\n  Is yet uncertain, found here i'th' Court,\n  And onely suffer'd to walk up and down,\n  As one not worth the owning.\n\n_Spa_.\n\n  O, I fear\n  _Tigranes_  will be caught, he looks, me-thinks,\n  As he would change his eyes with her; some help\n  There is above for me, I hope.\n\n_Tigr_.\n\n  Why do you turn away, and weep so fast,\n  And utter things that mis-become your looks,\n  Can you want owning?\n\n_Spa_.\n\n  O 'tis certain so.\n\n_Tigr_.\n\n  Acknowledge your self mine.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  How now?\n\n_Tigr_.\n\n  And then see if you want an owner.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  They are talking.\n\n_Tigr_.\n\n  Nations shall owne you for their Queen.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  _Tigranes_, art not thou my prisoner?\n\n_Tigr_.\n\n  I am.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  And who is this?\n\n_Tigr_.\n\n  She is your Sister.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  She is so.\n\n_Mar_.\n\n  Is she so again? that's well.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  And then how dare you offer to change words with her?\n\n_Tigr_.\n\n  Dare do it! Why? you brought me hither Sir,\n  To that intent.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  Perhaps I told you so,\n  If I had sworn it, had you so much folly\n  To credit it? The least word that she speaks\n  Is worth a life; rule your disordered tongue,\n  Or I will temper it.\n\n_Spa_.\n\n  Blest be the breath.\n\n_Tigr_.\n\n  Temper my tongue! such incivilities\n  As these, no barbarous people ever knew:\n  You break the lawes of Nature, and of Nations,\n  You talk to me as if I were a prisoner\n  For theft: my tongue be temper'd? I must speak\n  If thunder check me, and I will.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  You will?\n\n_Spa_.\n\n  Alas my fortune.\n\n_Tigr_.\n\n  Do not fear his frown, dear Madam, hear me.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  Fear not my frown? but that 'twere base in me\n  To fight with one I know I can o'recome,\n  Again thou shouldst be conquer'd by me.\n\n_Mar_.\n\n  He has one ransome with him already; me-thinks\n  'T were good to fight double, or quit.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  Away with him to prison: Now Sir, see\n  If my frown be regardless; Why delay you?\n  Seise him _Bacurius_, you shall know my word\n  Sweeps like a wind, and all it grapples with,\n  Are as the chaffe before it.\n\n_Tigr_.\n\n  Touch me not.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  Help there.\n\n_Tigr_.\n\n  Away.\n\n_1 Gent_.\n\n  It is in vain to struggle.\n\n_2 Gent_.\n\n  You must be forc'd.\n\n_Bac_.\n\n  Sir, you must pardon us, we must obey.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  Why do you dally there? drag him away\n  By any thing.\n\n_Bac_.\n\n  Come Sir.\n\n_Tigr_.\n\n  Justice, thou ought'st to give me strength enough\n  To shake all these off; This is tyrannie,\n  _Arbaces_, sutler than the burning Bulls,\n  Or that fam'd _Titans_  bed. Thou mightst as well\n  Search i'th' deep of Winter through the snow\n  For half starv'd people, to bring home with thee,\n  To shew 'em fire, and send 'em back again,\n  As use me thus.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  Let him be close, _Bacurius_.\n\n                            [_Exeunt_  Tigr. _And_  Bac.\n\n_Spa_.\n\n  I ne're rejoyc'd at any ill to him,\n  But this imprisonment: what shall become\n  Of me forsaken?\n\n_Gob_.\n\n  You will not let your Sister\n  Depart thus discontented from you, Sir?\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  By no means _Gobrias_, I have done her wrong,\n  And made my self believe much of my self,\n  That is not in me: You did kneel to me,\n  Whilest I stood stubborn and regardless by,\n  And like a god incensed, gave no ear\n  To all your prayers: behold, I kneel to you,\n  Shew a contempt as large as was my own,\n  And I will suffer it, yet at the last forgive me.\n\n_Pan_.\n\n  O you wrong me more in this,\n  Than in your rage you did: you mock me now.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  Never forgive me then, which is the worst\n  Can happen to me.\n\n_Pan_.\n\n  If you be in earnest,\n  Stand up and give me but a gentle look,\n  And two kind words, and I shall be in heaven.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  Rise you then to hear; I acknowledge thee\n  My hope, the only jewel of my life,\n  The best of Sisters, dearer than my breath,\n  A happiness as high as I could think;\n  And when my actions call thee otherwise,\n  Perdition light upon me.\n\n_Pan_.\n\n  This is better\n  Than if you had not frown'd, it comes to me,\n  Like mercie at the block, and when I leave\n  To serve you with my life, your curse be with me.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  Then thus I do salute thee, and again,\n  To make this knot the stronger, Paradise\n  Is there: It may be you are yet in doubt,\n  This third kiss blots it out, I wade in sin,\n  And foolishly intice my self along;\n  Take her away, see her a prisoner\n  In her own chamber closely, _Gobrias_.\n\n_Pan_.\n\n  Alas Sir, why?\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  I must not stay the answer, doe it.\n\n_Gob_.\n\n  Good Sir.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  No more, doe it I say.\n\n_Mard_.\n\n  This is better and better.\n\n_Pan_.\n\n  Yet hear me speak.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  I will not hear you speak,\n  Away with her, let no man think to speak\n  For such a creature; for she is a witch,\n  A prisoner, and a Traitor.\n\n_Gob_.\n\n  Madam, this office grieves me.\n\n_Pan_.\n\n  Nay, 'tis well the king is pleased with it.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  _Bessus_, go you along too with her; I will prove\n  All this that I have said, if I may live\n  So long; but I am desperately sick,\n  For she has given me poison in a kiss;\n  She had't betwixt her lips, and with her eyes\n  She witches people: go without a word.\n\n               [_Exeunt_  Gob.

What am I, alas,\n  That you oppose me? if my secret thoughts\n  Have ever harbour'd swellings against you,\n  They could not hurt you, and it is in you\n  To give me sorrow, that will render me\n  Apt to receive your mercy; rather so,\n  Let it be rather so, than punish me\n  With such unmanly sins: Incest is in me\n  Dwelling already, and it must be holy\n  That pulls it thence, where art _Mardonius_?\n\n_Mar_.\n\n  Here Sir.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  I pray thee bear me, if thou canst,\n  Am I not grown a strange weight?\n\n_Mar_.\n\n   As you were.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  No heavier?\n\n_Mar_.\n\n  No Sir.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  Why, my legs\n  Refuse to bear my body; O _Mardonius_,\n  Thou hast in field beheld me, when thou knowst\n  I could have gone, though I could never run.\n\n_Mar_.\n\n  And so I shall again.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  O no, 'tis past.\n\n_Mar_.\n\n  Pray you go rest your self.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  Wilt thou hereafter when they talk of me,\n  As thou shalt hear nothing but infamy,\n  Remember some of those things?\n\n_Mar_.\n\n  Yes I will.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  I pray thee do: for thou shalt never see me so again.\n\n                                                  [_Exeunt_.\n\n_Enter Bessus alone_.\n\n_Bes_.\n\n  They talk of fame, I have gotten it in the wars; and will afford\n  any man a reasonable penny-worth: some will say, they could be\n  content to have it, but that it is to be atchiev'd with danger;\n  but my opinion is otherwise: for if I might stand still in\n  Cannon-proof, and have fame fall upon me, I would refuse it: my\n  reputation came principally by thinking to run away, which no\n  body knows but _Mardonius_, and I think he conceals it to anger\n  me. Before I went to the warrs, I came to the Town a young\n  fellow, without means or parts to deserve friends; and my empty\n  guts perswaded me to lie, and abuse people for my meat, which I\n  did, and they beat me: then would I fast two days, till my\n  hunger cri'd out on me, rail still, then me-thought I had a\n  monstrous stomach to abuse 'em again, and did it. I, this state I\n  continu'd till they hung me up by th' heels, and beat me wi'\n  hasle sticks, as if they would have baked me, and have cousen'd\n  some body wi'me for Venison: After this I rail'd, and eat\n  quietly: for the whole Kingdom took notice of me for a baffl'd\n  whipt fellow, and what I said was remembred in mirth but never in\n  anger, of which I was glad; I would it were at that pass again.\n  After this, heaven calls an Aunt of mine, that left two hundred\n  pound in a cousins hand for me, who taking me to be a gallant\n  young spirit, raised a company for me with the money and sent me\n  into _Armenia_  with 'em: Away I would have run from them, but\n  that I could get no company, and alone I durst not run. I was\n  never at battail but once, and there I was running, but\n  _Mardonius_  cudgel'd me; yet I got loose at last, but was so\n  fraid, that I saw no more than my shoulders doe, but fled with my\n  whole company amongst my Enemies, and overthrew 'em: Now the\n  report of my valour is come over before me, and they say I was a\n  raw young fellow, but now I am improv'd, a Plague on their\n  eloquence, 't will cost me many a beating; And _Mardonius_  might\n  help this too, if he would; for now they think to get honour on\n  me, and all the men I have abus'd call me freshly worthily, as\n  they call it by the way of challenge.\n\n_Enter a Gent_.\n\n_3 Gent_.\n\n  Good morrow, Captain _Bessus_.\n\n_Bes_.\n\n  Good morrow Sir.\n\n_3 Gent_.\n\n  I come to speak with you.\n\n_Bes_.\n\n  You're very welcome.\n\n_3 Gent_.\n\n  From one that holds himself wrong'd by you some\n  three years since: your worth he says is fam'd, and he doth\n  nothing doubt but you will do him right, as beseems a souldier.\n\n_Bes_.\n\n  A pox on 'em, so they cry all.\n\n_3 Gent_.\n\n  And a slight note I have about me for you, for the delivery of\n  which you must excuse me; it is an office that friendship calls\n  upon me to do, and no way offensive to you; since I desire but\n  right on both sides.\n\n_Bes_.\n\n  'Tis a challenge Sir, is it not?\n\n_3 Gent_.\n\n  'Tis an inviting to the field.\n\n_Bes_.\n\n  An inviting? O Sir your Mercy, what a Complement he delivers it\n  with? he might as agreeable to my nature present me poison with\n  such a speech: um um um reputation, um um um call you to account,\n  um um um forc'd to this, um um um with my Sword, um um um like a\n  Gentleman, um um um dear to me, um um um satisfaction: 'Tis very\n  well Sir, I do accept it, but he must await an answer this\n  thirteen weeks.\n\n_3 Gent_.\n\n  Why Sir, he would be glad to wipe off his stain as soon as he\n  could.\n\n_Bes_.\n\n  Sir upon my credit I am already ingag'd to two hundred, and\n  twelve, all which must have their stains wip'd off, if that be\n  the word, before him.\n\n_3 Gent_.\n\n  Sir, if you be truly ingag'd but to one, he shall stay a\n  competent time.\n\n_Bes_.\n\n  Upon my faith Sir, to two hundred and twelve, and I have a spent\n  body, too much bruis'd in battel, so that I cannot fight, I must\n  be plain, above three combats a day: All the kindness I can shew\n  him, is to set him resolvedly in my rowle, the two hundred and\n  thirteenth man, which is something, for I tell you, I think there\n  will be more after him, than before him, I think so; pray you\n  commend me to him, and tell him this.\n\n_3 Gent_.\n\n  I will Sir, good morrow to you.\n\n                                             [_Exit 3 Gent_.\n\n_Bes_.\n\n  Good morrow good Sir. Certainly my safest way were to print my\n  self a coward, with a discovery how I came by my credit, and clap\n  it upon every post; I have received above thirty challenges\n  within this two hours, marry all but the first I put off with\n  ingagement, and by good fortune, the first is no madder of\n  fighting than I, so that that's referred, the place where it must\n  be ended, is four days journey off, and our arbitratours are\n  these: He has chosen a Gentleman in travel, and I have a special\n  friend with a quartain ague, like to hold him this five years,\n  for mine: and when his man comes home, we are to expect my\n  friends health: If they would finde me challenges thus thick, as\n  long as I liv'd, I would have no other living; I can make seven\n  shillings a day o'th' paper to the Grocers: yet I learn nothing\n  by all these but a little skill in comparing of stiles. I do\n  finde evidently, that there is some one Scrivener in this Town,\n  that has a great hand in writing of Challenges, for they are all\n  of a cut, and six of 'em in a hand; and they all end, my\n  reputation is dear to me, and I must require satisfaction: Who's\n  there? more paper I hope, no, 'tis my Lord _Bacurius_, I fear all\n  is not well betwixt us.\n\n_Enter_  Bacurius.\n\n_Bac_.\n\n  Now Captain _Bessus_, I come about a frivolous matter, caus'd by\n  as idle a report: you know you were a coward.\n\n_Bes_.\n\n  Very right.\n\n_Bac_.\n\n  And wronged me.\n\n_Bes_.\n\n  True my Lord.\n\n_Bac_.\n\n  But now people will call you valiant, desertlesly I think, yet\n  for their satisfaction, I will have you fight with me.\n\n_Bes_.\n\n  O my good Lord, my deep Engagements.\n\n_Bac_.\n\n  Tell not me of your Engagements, Captain _Bessus_, it is not to\n  be put off with an excuse: for my own part, I am none of the\n  multitude that believe your conversion from Coward.\n\n_Bes_.\n\n  My Lord, I seek not Quarrels, and this belongs not to me, I am\n  not to maintain it.\n\n_Bac_.\n\n  Who then pray?\n\n_Bes_.\n\n  _Bessus_  the Coward wrong'd you.\n\n_Bac_.\n\n  Right.\n\n_Bes_.\n\n  And shall _Bessus_  the Valiant, maintain what _Bessus_  the Coward\n  did?\n\n_Bac_.\n\n  I pray thee leave these cheating tricks, I swear thou shalt fight\n  with me, or thou shall be beaten extreamly, and kick'd.\n\n_Bes_.\n\n  Since you provoke me thus far, my Lord, I will fight with you,\n  and by my Sword it shall cost me twenty pound, but I will have my\n  Leg well a week sooner purposely.\n\n_Bac_.\n\n  Your Leg? Why, what ailes your Leg? i'le do a cure on you, stand\n  up.\n\n_Bes_.\n\n  My Lord, this is not Noble in you.\n\n_Bac_.\n\n  What dost thou with such a phrase in thy mouth?

Bac.\n\n_Mar_.\n\n  Sir, you have done well now.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  Dare you reprove it?\n\n_Mar_.\n\n  No.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  You must be crossing me.\n\n_Mar_.\n\n  I have no letters Sir to anger you,\n  But a dry sonnet of my Corporals\n  To an old Suttlers wife, and that I'll burn, Sir.\n  'Tis like to prove a fine age for the Ignorant.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  How darst thou so often forfeit thy life?\n  Thou know'st 'tis in my power to take it.\n\n_Mar_.\n\n  Yes, and I know you wo'not, or if you doe, you'll miss it\n  quickly.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  Why?\n\n_Mar_.\n\n  Who shall tell you of these childish follies\n  When I am dead? who shall put to his power\n  To draw those vertues out of a flood of humors,\n  When they are drown'd, and make'em shine again?\n  No, cut my head off:\n  Then you may talk, and be believed, and grow worse,\n  And have your too self-glorious temper rot\n  Into a deep sleep, and the Kingdom with you,\n  Till forraign swords be in your throats, and slaughter\n  Be every where about you like your flatterers.\n  Do, kill me.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  Prethee be tamer, good _Mardonius,_\n  Thou know'st I love thee, nay I honour thee,\n  Believe it good old Souldier, I am thine;\n  But I am rack'd clean from my self, bear with me,\n  Woot thou bear with me my _Mardonius?_\n\n_Enter_  Gobrias.\n\n_Mar_.\n\n  There comes a good man, love him too, he's temperate,\n  You may live to have need of such a vertue,\n  Rage is not still in fashion.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  Welcome good _Gobrias_.\n\n_Gob_.\n\n  My service and this letter to your Grace.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  From whom?\n\n_Gob_.\n\n  From the rich Mine of vertue and beauty,\n  Your mournfull Sister.\n\n_Arb_.\n\nShe is in prison, _Gobrias,_  is she not?\n\n_Gob_.\n\n  She is Sir, till your pleasure to enlarge her,\n  Which on my knees I beg. Oh 'tis not fit,\n  That all the sweetness of the world in one,\n  The youth and vertue that would tame wild Tygers,\n  And wilder people, that have known no manners,\n  Should live thus cloistred up; for your loves sake,\n  If there be any in that noble heart,\n  To her a wretched Lady, and forlorn,\n  Or for her love to you, which is as much\n  As nature and obedience ever gave,\n  Have pity on her beauties.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  Pray thee stand up; 'Tis true, she is too fair,\n  And all these commendations but her own,\n  Would thou had'st never so commended her,\n  Or I nere liv'd to have heard it _Gobrias;_\n  If thou but know'st the wrong her beautie does her,\n  Thou wouldst in pity of her be a lyar,\n  Thy ignorance has drawn me wretched man,\n  Whither my self nor thou canst well tell: O my fate!\n  I think she loves me, but I fear another\n  Is deeper in her heart: How thinkst thou _Gobrias_?\n\n_Gob_.\n\n  I do beseech your Grace believe it not,\n  For let me perish if it be not false. Good Sir, read her Letter.\n\n_Mar_.\n\n  This Love, or what a devil it is I know not, begets more mischief\n  than a Wake. I had rather be well beaten, starv'd, or lowsie,\n  than live within the Air on't. He that had seen this brave fellow\n  Charge through a grove of Pikes but t'other day, and look upon\n  him now, will ne'r believe his eyes again: if he continue thus\n  but two days more, a Taylor may beat him with one hand tied\n  behind him.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  Alas, she would be at liberty.\n  And there be a thousand reasons _Gobrias,_\n  Thousands that will deny't:\n  Which if she knew, she would contentedly\n  Be where she is: and bless her vertues for it,\n  And me, though she were closer, she would, _Gobrias,_\n  Good man indeed she would.\n\n_Gob_.\n\n  Then good Sir, for her satisfaction,\n  Send for her and with reason make her know\n  Why she must live thus from you.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  I will; go bring her to me.\n\n                                              [_Exeunt all_.\n\n_Enter_  Bessus, _And two Sword-men, and a Boy_.\n\n_Bes_.\n\n  Y'are very welcome both; some stools boy,\n  And reach a Table; Gentlemen o'th' Sword,\n  Pray sit without more complement; be gone child.\n  I have been curious in the searching of you,\n  Because I understand you wise and valiant persons.\n\n_1_.\n\n  We understand our selves Sir.\n\n_Bes_.\n\n  Nay Gentlemen, and dear friends o'th' Sword,\n  No complement I pray, but to the cause\n  I hang upon, which in few, is my honour.\n\n_2_.\n\n  You cannot hang too much Sir, for your honour,\n  But to your cause.\n\n_Bes_.\n\n  Be wise, and speak truth, my first doubt is,\n  My beating by my Prince.\n\n_1_.\n\n  Stay there a little Sir, do you doubt a beating?\n  Or have you had a beating by your Prince?\n\n_Bes_.\n\n  Gentlemen o'th' Sword, my Prince has beaten me.\n\n_2_.\n\n  Brother, what think you of this case?\n\n_1_.\n\n  If he has beaten him, the case is clear.\n\n_2_.\n\n  If he have beaten him, I grant the case;\n  But how? we cannot be too subtil in this business,\n  I say, but how?\n\n_Bes_.\n\n  Even with his Royal hand.\n\n_1_.\n\n  Was it a blow of love, or indignation?\n\n_Bes_.\n\n  'Twas twenty blows of indignation, Gentlemen,\n  Besides two blows o'th face.\n\n_2_.\n\n  Those blows o'th' face have made a new cause on't,\n  The rest were but an horrible rudeness.\n\n_1_.\n\n  Two blows o'th' face, and given by a worse man, I must confess,\n  as the Sword-men say, had turn'd the business: Mark me brother,\n  by a worse man; but being by his Prince, had they been ten, and\n  those ten drawn teeth, besides the hazard of his nose for ever;\n  all this had been but favours: this is my flat opinion, which\n  I'le die in.\n\n_2_.\n\n  The King may do much Captain, believe it; for had he crackt your\n  Scull through, like a bottle, or broke a Rib or two with tossing\n  of you, yet you had lost no honour: This is strange you may\n  imagine, but this is truth now Captain.\n\n_Bes_.\n\n  I will be glad to embrace it Gentlemen;\n  But how far may he strike me?\n\n_1_.\n\n  There is another: a new cause rising from the time and distance,\n  in which I will deliver my opinion: he may strike, beat, or cause\n  to be beaten: for these are natural to man: your Prince, I say,\n  may beat you, so far forth as his dominion reacheth, that's for\n  the distance; the time, ten miles a day, I take it.\n\n_2_.\n\n  Brother, you err, 'tis fifteen miles a day,\n  His stage is ten, his beatings are fifteen.\n\n_Bes_.\n\n  'Tis the longest, but we subjects must--\n\n_1_.\n\n  Be subject to it; you are wise and vertuous.\n\n_Bes_.\n\n  Obedience ever makes that noble use on't,\n  To which I dedicate my beaten body;\n  I must trouble you a little further, Gentlemen o'th' Sword.\n\n_2_.\n\n  No trouble at all to us Sir, if we may\n  Profit your understanding, we are bound\n  By vertue of our calling to utter our opinions,\n  Shortly, and discreetly.\n\n_Bes_.\n\n  My sorest business is, I have been kick'd.\n\n_2_.\n\n  How far Sir?\n\n_Bes_.\n\n  Not to flatter my self in it, all over, my sword forc'd but not\n  lost; for discreetly I rendred it to save that imputation.\n\n_1_.\n\n  It shew'd discretion, the best part of valour.\n\n_2_.\n\n  Brother, this is a pretty cause, pray ponder on't;\n  Our friend here has been kick'd.\n\n_1_.\n\n  He has so, brother.\n\n_2_.\n\n  Sorely he saies: Now, had he set down here\n  Upon the meer kick, 't had been Cowardly.\n\n_1_.\n\n  I think it had been Cowardly indeed.\n\n_2_.\n\n  But our friend has redeem'd it in delivering\n  His sword without compulsion; and that man\n  That took it of him, I pronounce a weak one,\n  And his kicks nullities.\n  He should have kick'd him after the delivering\n  Which is the confirmation of a Coward.\n\n_1_.\n\n  Brother, I take it, you mistake the question;\n  For, say that I were kick'd.\n\n_2_.\n\n  I must not say so;\n  Nor I must not hear it spoke by the tongue of man.\n  You kick'd, dear brother! you're merry.\n\n_1_.\n\n  But put the case I were kick'd?\n\n_2_.\n\n  Let them put it that are things weary of their lives, and know\n  not honour; put the case you were kick'd?\n\n_1_.\n\n  I do not say I was kickt.\n\n_2_.\n\n  Nor no silly creature that wears his head without a Case, his\n  soul in a Skin-coat: You kickt dear brother?\n\n_Bes_.\n\n  Nay Gentlemen, let us do what we shall do,\n  Truly and honest[l]y; good Sirs to the question.\n\n_1_.\n\n  Why then I say, suppose your Boy kick't, Captain?\n\n_2_.\n\n  The Boy may be suppos'd is liable.\n\n_1_.\n\n  A foolish forward zeal Sir, in my friend;\n  But to the Boy, suppose the Boy were kickt.\n\n_Bes_.\n\n  I do suppose it.\n\n_1_.\n\n  Has your Boy a sword?\n\n_Bes_.\n\n  Surely no; I pray suppose a sword too.\n\n_1_.\n\n  I do suppose it; you grant your Boy was kick't then.\n\n_2_.\n\n  By no means Captain, let it be supposed still; the word grant,\n  makes not for us.\n\n_1_.\n\n  I say this must be granted.\n\n_2_\n\n  This must be granted brother?\n\n_1_.\n\n  I, this must be granted.\n\n_2_.\n\n  Still this must?\n\n_1_.\n\n  I say this must be granted.\n\n_2_.\n\n  I, give me the must again, brother, you palter.\n\n_1_.\n\n  I will not hear you, wasp.\n\n_2_.\n\n  Brother, I say you palter, the must three times together; I wear\n  as sharp Steel as another man, and my Fox bites as deep, musted,\n  my dear brother. But to the cause again.\n\n_Bes_.\n\n  Nay look you Gentlemen.\n\n_2_.\n\n  In a word, I ha' done.\n\n_1_.\n\n  A tall man but intemperate, 'tis great pity;\n  Once more suppose the Boy kick'd.\n\n_2_.\n\n  Forward.\n\n_1_.\n\n  And being thorowly kick'd, laughs at the kicker.\n\n_2_\n\n  So much for us; proceed.\n\n_1_.\n\n  And in this beaten scorn, as I may call it,\n  Delivers up his weapon; where lies the error?\n\n_Bes_.\n\n  It lies i'th' beating Sir, I found it four dayes since.\n\n_2_.\n\n  The error, and a sore one as I take it,\n  Lies in the thing kicking.\n\n_Bes_.\n\n  I understand that well, 'tis so indeed Sir.\n\n_1_.\n\n  That is according to the man that did it.\n\n_2_.\n\n  There springs a new branch, whose was the foot?\n\n_Bes_.\n\n  A Lords.\n\n_1_.\n\n  The cause is mighty, but had it been two Lords,\n  And both had kick'd you, if you laugh, 'tis clear.\n\n_Bes_.\n\n  I did laugh,\n  But how will that help me, Gentlemen?\n\n_2_.\n\n  Yes, it shall help you if you laught aloud.\n\n_Bes_.\n\n  As loud as a kick'd man could laugh, I laught Sir.\n\n_1_.\n\n  My reason now, the valiant man is known\n  By suffering and contemning; you have\n  Enough of both, and you are valiant.\n\n_2_.\n\n  If he be sure he has been kick'd enough:\n  For that brave sufferance you speak of brother,\n  Consists not in a beating and away,\n  But in a cudgell'd body, from eighteen\n  To eight and thirty; in a head rebuk'd\n  With pots of all size, degrees, stools, and bed-staves,\n  This showes a valiant man.\n\n_Bes_.\n\n  Then I am valiant, as valiant as the proudest,\n  For these are all familiar things to me;\n  Familiar as my sleep, or want of money,\n  All my whole body's but one bruise with beating,\n  I think I have been cudgell'd with all nations,\n  And almost all Religions.\n\n_2_.\n\n  Embrace him brother, this man is valiant,\n  I know it by my self, he's valiant.\n\n_1_.\n\n  Captain, thou art a valiant Gentleman,\n  To bide upon, a very valiant man.\n\n_Bes_.\n\n  My equall friends o'th'Sword, I must request your hands to this.\n\n_2_.\n\n  'Tis fit it should be.\n\n_Bes_.\n\n  Boy, get me some wine, and pen and Ink within:\n  Am I clear, Gentlemen?\n\n_1_.\n\n  Sir, the world has taken notice what we have done,\n  Make much of your body, for I'll pawn my steel,\n  Men will be coyer of their legs hereafter.\n\n_Bes_.\n\n  I must request you goe along and testife to the Lord _Bacurius_,\n  whose foot has struck me, how you find my cause.\n\n_2_.\n\n  We will, and tell that Lord he must be rul'd,\n  Or there are those abroad, will rule his Lordship.\n\n                                                  [_Exeunt_.\n\n_Enter_ Arbaces _at one door, and_  Gob. _and_ Panthea _at\nanother_.\n\n_Gob_.\n\n  Sir, here's the Princess.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  Leave us then alone,\n  For the main cause of her imprisonment\n  Must not be heard by any but her self.\n\n                                                [_Exit_  Gob.\n\n  You're welcome Sister, and would to heaven\n  I could so bid you by another name:\n  If you above love not such sins as these,\n  Circle my heart with thoughts as cold as snow\n  To quench these rising flames that harbour here.\n\n_ [P]an_.\n\n  Sir, does it please you I should speak?\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  Please me?\n  I, more than all the art of musick can,\n  Thy speech doth please me, for it ever sounds,\n  As thou brought'st joyfull unexpected news;\n  And yet it is not fit thou shouldst be heard.\n  I pray thee think so.\n\n_Pan_.\n\n   Be it so, I will.\n  Am I the first that ever had a wrong\n  So far from being fit to have redress,\n  That 'twas unfit to hear it? I will back\n  To prison, rather than disquiet you,\n  And wait till it be fit.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  No, do not goe;\n  For I will hear thee with a serious thought:\n  I have collected all that's man about me\n  Together strongly, and I am resolv'd\n  To hear thee largely, but I do beseech thee,\n  Do not come nearer to me, for there is\n  Something in that, that will undoe us both.\n\n_Pan_.\n\n  Alas Sir, am I venome?\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  Yes, to me;\n  Though of thy self I think thee to be\n  In equall degree of heat or cold,\n  As nature can make: yet as unsound men\n  Convert the sweetest and the nourishing'st meats\n  Into diseases; so shall I distemper'd,\n  Do thee, I pray thee draw no nearer to me.\n\n_Pan_.\n\n  Sir, this is that I would: I am of late\n  Shut from the world, and why it should be thus,\n  Is all I wish to know.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  Why credit me _Panthea_,\n  Credit me that am thy brother,\n  Thy loving brother, that there is a cause\n  Sufficient, yet unfit for thee to know,\n  That might undoe thee everlastingly,\n  Only to hear, wilt thou but credit this?\n  By Heaven 'tis true, believe it if thou canst.\n\n_Pan_.\n\n  Children and fools are ever credulous,\n  And I am both, I think, for I believe;\n  If you dissemble, be it on your head;\n  I'le back unto my prison: yet me-thinks\n  I might be kept in some place where you are;\n  For in my self, I find I know not what\n  To call it, but it is a great desire\n  To see you often.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  Fie, you come in a step, what do you mean?\n  Dear sister, do not so: Alas _Panthea_,\n  Where I am would you be? Why that's the cause\n  You are imprison'd, that you may not be\n  Where I am.\n\n_Pan_.\n\nThen I must indure it Sir, Heaven keep you.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  Nay, you shall hear the case in short _Panthea_,\n  And when thou hear'st it, thou wilt blush for me,\n  And hang thy head down like a Violet\n  Full of the mornings dew: There is a way\n  To gain thy freedome, but 'tis such a one\n  As puts thee in worse bondage, and I know,\n  Thou wouldst encounter fire, and make a proof\n  Whether the gods have care of innocence,\n  Rather than follow it: Know that I have lost,\n  The only difference betwixt man and beast,\n  My reason.\n\n_Pan_.\n\n  Heaven forbid.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  Nay 'tis gone;\n  And I am left as far without a bound,\n  As the wild Ocean, that obeys the winds;\n  Each sodain passion throwes me where it lists,\n  And overwhelms all that oppose my will:\n  I have beheld thee with a lustfull eye;\n  My heart is set on wickedness to act\n  Such sins with thee, as I have been afraid\n  To think of, if thou dar'st consent to this,\n  Which I beseech thee do not, thou maist gain\n  Thy liberty, and yield me a content;\n  If not, thy dwelling must be dark and close,\n  Where I may never see thee; For heaven knows\n  That laid this punishment upon my pride,\n  Thy sight at some time will enforce my madness\n  To make a start e'ne to thy ravishing;\n  Now spit upon me, and call all reproaches\n  Thou canst devise together, and at once\n  Hurle'em against me: for I am a sickness\n  As killing as the plague, ready to seize thee.\n\n_Pan_.\n\n  Far be it from me to revile the King:\n  But it is true, that I shall rather choose\n  To search out death, that else would search out me,\n  And in a grave sleep with my innocence,\n  Than welcome such a sin: It is my fate,\n  To these cross accidents I was ordain'd,\n  And must have patience; and but that my eyes\n  Have more of woman in 'em than my heart,\n  I would not weep: Peace enter you again.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  Farwell, and good _Panthea_  pray for me,\n  Thy prayers are pure, that I may find a death\n  However soon before my passions grow\n  That they forget what I desire is sin;\n  For thither they are tending: if that happen,\n  Then I shall force thee tho' thou wert a Virgin\n  By vow to Heaven, and shall pull a heap\n  Of strange yet uninvented sin upon me.\n\n_Pan_.\n\n  Sir, I will pray for you, yet you shall know\n  It is a sullen fate that governs us,\n  For I could wish as heartily as you\n  I were no sister to you, I should then\n  Imbrace your lawfull love, sooner than health.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  Couldst thou affect me then?\n\n_Pan_.\n\n  So perfectly,\n  That as it is, I ne're shall sway my heart,\n  To like another.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  Then I curse my birth,\n  Must this be added to my miseries\n  That thou art willing too? is there no stop\n  To our full happiness, but these meer sounds\n  Brother and Sister?\n\n_Pan_.\n\n  There is nothing else,\n  But these alas will separate us more\n  Than twenty worlds betwixt us.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  I have liv'd\n  To conquer men and now am overthrown\n  Only by words Brother and Sister: where\n  Have those words dwelling?

If I shall\n  speak now as her Father, I cannot chuse but greatly rejoyce that\n  she shall be a Queen: but if I shall speak to you as a\n  States-man, she were more fit to be your whore.\n\n_Tigr_.\n\n  Get you about your business to _Arbaces_, now you talk idlely.\n\n_Lyg_.\n\n  Yes Sir, I will go, and shall she be a Queen? she had more wit\n  than her old Father, when she ran away: shall she be Queen? now\n  by my troth 'tis fine, I'le dance out of all measure at her\n  wedding: shall I not Sir?\n\n_Tigr_.\n\n  Yes marry shalt thou.\n\n_Lyg_.\n\n  I'le make these withered kexes bear my body two hours together\n  above ground.\n\n_Tigr_.\n\n  Nay go, my business requires hast.\n\n_Lyg_.\n\n  Good Heaven preserve you, you are an excellent King.\n\n_Spa_.\n\n  Farwell good Father.\n\n_Lyg_.\n\n  Farwell sweet vertuous Daughter, I never was so joyfull in all my\n  life, that I remember: shall she be a Queen?

There is a method in mans wickedness, it grows up\n  by degrees: I am not come so high as killing of my self, there\n  are a hundred thousand sins 'twixt me and it, which I must doe,\n  and I shall come to't at last; but take my oath not now, be\n  satisfied, and get thee hence.\n\n_Mar_.\n\n  I am sorry 'tis so ill.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  Be sorry then, true sorrow is alone, grieve by thy\n  self.\n\n_Mar_.\n\n  I pray you let me see your Sword put up before I go: I'le leave\n  you then.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  Why so? what folly is this in thee, is it not as apt to mischief\n  as it was before? can I not reach it thinkst thou? these are\n  toyes for Children to be pleas'd with, and not men, now I am safe\n  you think: I would the book of fate were here, my Sword is not so\n  sure but I would get it out and mangle that, that all the\n  destinies should quite forget their fixt decrees, and hast to\n  make us new, for other fortunes, mine could not be worse, wilt\n  thou now leave me?\n\n_Mar_.\n\n  Heaven put into your bosome temperate thoughts, I'le leave you\n  though I fear.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  Go, thou art honest, why should the hasty error of my youth be so\n  unpardonable to draw a sin helpless upon me?\n\n  _Enter_  Gobrias.\n\n_Gob_.\n\n  There is the King, now it is ripe.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  Draw near thou guilty man, that art the authour of the loathedst\n  crime five ages have brought forth, and hear me speak; curses\n  more incurable, and all the evils mans body or his Spirit can\n  receive be with thee.\n\n_Gob_.\n\n  Why Sir do you curse me thus?\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  Why do I curse thee? if there be a man subtil in curses, that\n  exceeds the rest, his worst wish on thee, thou hast broke my\n  heart.\n\n_Gob_.\n\n  How Sir, have I preserv'd you from a child, from all the arrows,\n  malice, or ambition could shoot at you, and have I this for my\n  pay?\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  'Tis true, thou didst preserve me, and in that wert crueller than\n  hardned murtherers of infants and their Mothers! thou didst save\n  me only till thou hadst studied out a way how to destroy me\n  cunningly thy self: this was a curious way of torturing.\n\n_Gob_.\n\n  What do you mean?\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  Thou knowst the evils thou hast done to me; dost thou remember\n  all those witching letters thou sent'st unto me to Armenia,\n  fill'd with the praise of my beloved Sister, where thou extol'st\n  her beauty, what had I to do with that? what could her beauty be\n  to me? and thou didst write how well she lov'd me, dost thou\n  remember this? so that I doted something before I saw her.\n\n_Gob_.\n\n  This is true.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  Is it? and when I was return'd thou knowst thou didst pursue it,\n  till thou woundst me into such a strange and unbeliev'd\n  affection, as good men cannot think on.\n\n_Gob_.\n\n  This I grant, I think I was the cause.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  Wert thou? Nay more, I think thou meant'st it.\n\n_Gob_.\n\n  Sir, I hate to lie, as I love Heaven and honesty, I did, it was\n  my meaning.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  Be thine own sad judge, a further condemnation will not need,\n  prepare thy self to dy.\n\n_Gob_.\n\n  Why Sir to dy?\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  Why shouldst thou live? was ever yet offender so impudent, that\n  had a thought of Mercy after confession of a crime like this? get\n  out I cannot where thou hurl'st me in, but I can take revenge,\n  that's all the sweetness left for me.\n\n_Gob_.\n\n  Now is the time, hear me but speak.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  No, yet I will be far more mercifull than thou wert to me; thou\n  didst steal into me and never gav'st me warning: so much time as\n  I give thee now, had prevented thee for ever. Notwithstanding all\n  thy sins, if thou hast hope, that there is yet a prayer to save\n  thee, turn and speak it to thy self.\n\n_Gob_.\n\n  Sir, you shall know your sins before you do'em, if you kill me.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  I will not stay then.\n\n_Gob_.\n\n  Know you kill your Father.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  How?\n\n_Gob_.\n\n  You kill your Father.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  My Father? though I know't for a lie, made out of fear to save\n  thy stained life; the very reverence of the word comes cross me,\n  and ties mine arm down.\n\n_Gob_.\n\n  I will tell you that shall heighten you again, I am thy Father, I\n  charge thee hear me.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  If it should be so, as 'tis most false, and that I should be\n  found a Bastard issue, the despised fruit of lawless lust, I\n  should no more admire all my wild passions: but another truth\n  shall be wrung from thee: if I could come by the Spirit of pain,\n  it should be poured on thee, till thou allow'st thy self more\n  full of lies than he that teaches thee.\n\n  _Enter_  Arane.\n\n_Ara_.\n\n  Turn thee about, I come to speak to thee thou wicked man, hear me\n  thou tyrant.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  I will turn to thee, hear me thou Strumpet; I have blotted out\n  the name of Mother, as thou hast thy shame.\n\n_Ara_.\n\n  My shame! thou hast less shame than any thing; why dost thou keep\n  my Daughter in a prison? why dost thou call her Sister, and do\n  this?\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  Cease thy strange impudence, and answer quickly if thou\n  contemnest me, this will ask an answer, and have it.\n\n_Ara_.\n\n  Help me Gentle _Gobrias_.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  Guilt [dare] not help guilt though they grow together in doing\n  ill, yet at the [punishment] they sever, and each flies the noise\n  of other, think not of help, answer.\n\n_Ara_.\n\n  I will, to what?\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  To such a thing, as if it be a truth think what a creature thou\n  hast made thy self, that didst not shame to do, what I must blush\n  only to ask thee: tell me who I am, whose son I am without all\n  circumstance, be thou as hasty as my Sword will be if thou\n  refusest.\n\n_Ara_.\n\n  Why, you are his son.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  His Son? swear, swear, thou worse than woman damn'd.\n\n_Ara_.\n\n  By all that's good you are.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  Then art thou all that ever was known bad, now is the cause of\n  all my strange mis-fortunes come to light: what reverence\n  expectest thou from a child, to bring forth which thou hast\n  offended heaven, thy husband, and the Land? adulterous witch, I\n  know now why thou wouldst have poyson'd me, I was thy lust which\n  thou wouldst have forgot: then wicked Mother of my sins, and me,\n  show me the way to the inheritance I have by thee: which is a\n  spacious world of impious acts, that I may soon possess it:\n  plagues rot thee, as thou liv'st, and such diseases, as use to\n  pay lust, recompence thy deed.\n\n_Gob_.\n\n  You do not know why you curse thus.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  Too well; you are a pair of Vipers; and behold the Serpent you\n  have got; there is no beast but if he knew it, has a pedigree as\n  brave as mine, for they have more descents, and I am every way as\n  beastly got, as far without the compass of Law as they.\n\n_Ara_.\n\n  You spend your rage and words in vain, and rail upon a guess;\n  hear us a little.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  No, I will never hear, but talk away my breath, and die.\n\n_Gob_.\n\n  Why, but you are no Bastard.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  How's that?\n\n_Ara_.\n\n  Nor child of mine.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  Still you go on in wonders to me.\n\n_Gob_.\n\n  Pray you be more patient, I may bring comfort to you.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  I will kneel, and hear with the obedience of a child; good Father\n  speak, I do acknowledge you, so you bring comfort.\n\n_Gob_.\n\n  First know, our last King, your supposed Father was old and\n  feeble when he married her, and almost all the Land thought she\n  was past hope of issue from him.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  Therefore she took leave to play the whore, because the King was\n  old: is this the comfort?\n\n_Ara_.\n\n  What will you find out to give me satisfaction, when you find how\n  you have injur'd me? let fire consume me, if ever I were a whore.\n\n_Gob_.\n\n  For-bear these starts, or I will leave you wedded to despair, as\n  you are now: if you can find a temper, my breath shall be a\n  pleasant western wind that cools and blasts not.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  Bring it out good Father. I'le lie, and listen here as reverently\n  as to an Angel: if I breath too loud, tell me; for I would be as\n  still as night.\n\n_Gob_.\n\n  Our King I say, was old, and this our Queen desir'd to bring an\n  heir, but yet her husband she thought was past it, and to be\n  dishonest I think she would not: if she would have been, the\n  truth is, she was watcht so narrowly, and had so slender\n  opportunities, she hardly could have been: but yet her cunning\n  found out this way; she feign'd her self with child, and posts\n  were sent in hast throughout the Land, and humble thanks was\n  given in every Church, and prayers were made for her safe going\n  and delivery: she feign'd now to grow bigger, and perceiv'd this\n  hope of issue made her fear'd, and brought a far more large\n  respect from every man, and saw her power increase, and was\n  resolv'd, since she believ'd, she could not hav't indeed, at\n  least she would be thought to have a child.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  Do I not hear it well? nay I will make no noise at all; but pray\n  you to the point, quickly as you can.\n\n_Gob_.\n\n  Now when the time was full, she should be brought to bed, I had a\n  Son born, which was you, this the Queen hearing of mov'd me to\n  let her have you; and such reasons she shewed me, as she knew\n  would tie my secrecie, she swore you should be King, and to be\n  short, I did deliver you unto her, and pretended you were dead,\n  and in mine own house kept a funeral, and had an empty coffin put\n  in Earth, that night this Queen feign'd hastily to labour and by\n  a pair of women of her own, which she had charm'd, she made the\n  world believe she was delivered of you. You grew up as the Kings\n  Son, till you were six years old; then did the King dye, and did\n  leave to me Protection of the Realm; and contrary to his own\n  expectation, left this Queen truely with child indeed, of the\n  fair Princess _Panthea_: then she could have torn her hair and\n  did alone to me, yet durst not speak in publick, for she knew she\n  should be found a traytor: and her tale would have been thought\n  madness, or any thing rather than truth. This was the only cause\n  why she did seek to poyson you, and I to keep you safe; and this\n  the reason, why I sought to kindle some sparks of love in you to\n  fair _Panthea_, that she might get part of her right again.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  And have you made an end now? is this all? if not,\n  I will be still till I be aged, till all my hairs be Silver.\n\n_Gob_.\n\n  This is all.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  And is it true say you too Madam?\n\n_Ara_.\n\n  Yes heaven knows it is most true.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  _Panthea_  then is not my Sister?\n\n_Gob_.\n\n  No.\n\n_Arb_. But can you prove this?\n\n_Gob_.\n\n  If you will give consent, else who dares go about it?\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  Give consent? why I will have 'em all that know it rackt, to get\n  this from 'em, all that wait without, come in, what ere you be,\n  come in and be partakers of my joy, O you are welcome.\n\n  _Enter_  Bessus, Gentlemen, Mardonius, _And other attendants_.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  The best news, nay draw no nearer, they all shall hear it, I am\n  found no King.\n\n_Mar_.\n\n  Is that so good news?\n\n_Arb_.\n\n   Yes the happiest news that ere was heard.\n\n_Mar_.\n\n  Indeed 'twere well for you if you might be a little less obey'd.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  One call the Queen.\n\n_Mar_.\n\n  Why she is there.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  The Queen _Mardonius_, _Panthea_  is the Queen and I am plain\n  _Arbaces_; go some one, she is in _Gobrias_  house, since I saw\n  you there are a thousand things delivered to me, you little dream\n  of.\n\n                                             [_Exit a Gent_.\n\n_Mar_.\n\n  So it should seem my Lord, what fury's this?\n\n_Gob_.\n\n  Believe me 'tis no fury, all that he saies is truth.\n\n_Mar_.\n\n  'Tis very strange.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  Why do you keep your hats off Gentlemen? is it to me? I swear it\n  must not be; nay, trust me, in good faith it must not be; I\n  cannot now command you, but I pray you for the respect you bare\n  me, when you took me for your King, each man clap on his hat at\n  my desire.\n\n_Mar_.\n\n  We will, you are not found so mean a man, but that you may be\n  cover'd as well as we, may you not?\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  O not here, you may, but not I, for here is my Father in\n  presence.\n\n_Mar_.\n\n  Where?\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  Why there: O the whole story would be a wilderness to lose thy\n  self for ever: O pardon me dear Father for all the idle and\n  unreverent words that I have spoke in idle moods to you: I am\n  _Arbaces_, we all fellow-subjects, nor is the Queen _Panthea_  now\n  my Sister.\n\n_Bes_.\n\n  Why if you remember fellow-subject _Arbaces_; I told you once\n  she was not your sister: I, and she lookt nothing like you.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  I think you did, good Captain _Bessus_.\n\n_Bes_.\n\n  Here will arise another question now amongst the Sword-men,\n  whether I be to call him to account for beating me, now he is\n  proved no King.\n\n  _Enter_  Lygones.\n\n_Mar_.\n\n  Sir here's Lygones, the agent for the Armenian_  State.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  Where is he? I know your business good Lygones.\n\n_Lyg_.\n\n  We must have our King again, and will.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  I knew that was your business: you shall have your King again,\n  and have him so again as never King was had, go one of you and\n  bid _Bacurius_  bring _Tigranes_  hither; and bring the Lady with\n  him, that _Panthea_, the Queen _Panthea_  sent me word this\n  [morning], was brave _Tigranes_  mistress.\n\n  [_Ex. two Gent_.\n\n_Lyg_.\n\n  'Tis _Spaconia_.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  I, I, _Spaconia_.\n\n_Lyg_.\n\n  She is my Daughter.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  She is so: I could now tell any thing I never heard: your King\n  shall go so home, as never man went.\n\n_Mar_.\n\n  Shall he go on's head?\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  He shall have chariots easier than air that I will have invented;\n  and ne're think one shall pay any ransome, and thy self that art\n  the messenger, shalt ride before him on a horse cut out of an\n  intire Diamond, that shall be made to go with golden wheeles, I\n  know not how yet.\n\n_Lyg_.\n\n  Why I shall be made for ever? they beli'd this King with us, and\n  said he was unkind.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  And then thy Daughter, she shall have some strange thing, wee'l\n  have the Kingdom sold utterly, and put into a toy which she shall\n  wear about her carelesly some where or other. See the vertuous\n  Queen; behold the humblest subject that you have kneel here\n  before you.\n\n  _Enter_  Panthea _And_  1 Gent.\n\n_Pan_.\n\n  Why kneel you to me that am your Vassal?\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  Grant me one request.\n\n_Pan_.\n\n  Alas what can I grant you? what I can, I will.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  That you will please to marry me if I can prove it lawfull.\n\n_Pan_.\n\n  Is that all? more willingly than I would draw this air.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  I'le kiss this hand in earnest.\n\n_2 Gent_.\n\n  Sir, _Tigranes_  is coming though he made it strange at first, to\n  see the Princess any more.\n\n  _Enter_  Tigranes _And_  Spaconia.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  The Queen thou meanest, O my _Tigranes_. Pardon me, tread on my\n  neck, I freely offer it, and if thou beest so given take revenge,\n  for I have injur'd thee.\n\n_Tigr_.\n\n  No, I forgive, and rejoyce more that you have found repentance,\n  than I my liberty.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  Mayest thou be happy in thy fair choice, for thou art temperate.\n  You owe no ransom to the state, know that I have a thousand joyes\n  to tell you of, which yet I dare not utter till I pay my thanks\n  to Heaven for 'em: Will you go with me and help me? pray you do.\n\n_Tigr_.\n\n  I will.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  Take then your fair one with you; and you Queen of goodness and\n  of us, O give me leave to take your arm in mine: come every one\n  that takes delight in goodness, help to sing loud thanks for me,\n  that I am prov'd no King.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n(A) A King and no King. | Acted at the Globe, by his Majesties\nServants. | Written by Francis Beamount, and John Flecher. | At\nLondon | Printed for Thomas Walkley, and are to bee sold | at his\nshoppe at the Eagle and Childe in | Brittans-Bursse. 1619.\n\n(B) A King | and | No King. | Acted at the Blacke-Fryars, by his\n| Majesties Servants. | And now the second time Printed,\naccording | to the true Copie. | Written by Francis Beamount and\n| John Flecher. | London, | Printed for Thomas Walkley, and are\nto be sold at | his shop at the Eagle and Childe in |\nBrittans-Burse. 1625.\n\n(C) A King, | and | No King. | Acted at the Blacke-Fryars, by his\n| Majesties Servants. | And now the third time Printed, according\n| to the true Copie. | Written by Francis Beamont & John Fletcher\nGent. | The Stationer to | Dramatophilus. | A Play and no Play,\nwho this Booke shall read, | Will judge, and weepe, as if 'twere\ndone indeed. | London, | Printed by A.

It was _Bessus_,\n  I dare almost with confidence pronounce it.\n\n_Lig_.\n\n  Tis such a scurvy name as _Bessus_, and now I thinke tis hee.\n\n_Mar_.\n\n  Captaine, doe you call him?\n  Beleeve me Sir, you have a miserie\n  Too mighty for your age: A pox upon him,\n  For that must be the end of all his service:\n  Your daughter was not mad Sir?\n\n_Lig_.\n\n  No, would shee had beene,\n  The fault had had more credit: I would doe something.\n\n_Mar_.\n\n  I would faine counsell you; but to what I know not:\n  Hee's so below a beating, that the women\n  Find him not worthy of their distaves; and\n  To hang him, were to cast away a rope,\n  Hee's such an ayrie thin unbodied coward,\n  That no revenge can catch him:\n  He tell you Sir, and tell you truth; this rascall\n  Feares neither God nor man, has beene so beaten:\n  Sufferance has made him wanscote; he has had\n  Since hee was first a slave, at least three hundred daggers\n  Set in his head, as little boyes doe new knives in hot meat;\n  Ther's not a rib in's bodie a my conscience,\n  That has not beene thrice broken with drie beating;\n  And now his sides looke like to wicker targets,\n  Everie way bended:\n  Children will shortly take him for a wall,\n  And set their stone-bowes in his forhead: is of so low a sence,\n  I cannot in a weeke imagine what should be done to him.\n\n_Lig_.\n\n  Sure I have committed some great sinne,\n  That this strange fellow should be made my rod:\n  I would see him, but I shall have no patience:\n\n_Mar_.\n\n  Tis no great matter if you have not, if a laming of him, or such\n  a toy may doe you pleasure Sir, he has it for you, and Ile helpe\n  you to him: tis no newes to him to have a leg broke, or a\n  shoulder out, with being turnd ath' stones like a Tanzie: Draw\n  not your sword, if you love it; for my conscience his head will\n  breake it: we use him ith' warres like a Ramme to shake a wall\n  withall; here comes the verie person of him, doe as you shall\n  find your temper I must leave you: but if you doe not breake him\n  like a bisket, you are much too blame Sir. _Ex. Mardo. Enter\n  Bessus and Sword-men_.\n\n_Lig_.\n\n  Is your name Bessus?\n\n_Bes_.\n\n  Men call me Captaine Bessus.\n\n_Lig_.\n\n  Then Captaine _Bessus_  you are a ranke rascall, without more\n  exordiums, a durty frozen slave; and with the favour of your\n  friends here, I will beate you.\n\n_2_.\n\n  Pray use your pleasure Sir, you seem to be a gentleman.\n\n_Lig_.\n\n  Thus Captaine _Bessus_, thus; thus twinge your nose, thus kicke\n  you, and thus tread you.\n\n_Bess_.\n\n  I doe beseech you yeeld your cause Sir quickly.\n\n_Lig_.\n\n  Indeed I should have told you that first.\n\n_Bess_.\n\n  I take it so.\n\n_1_.\n\n  Captaine, a should indeed, he is mistaken:\n\n_Lig_.\n\n  Sir you shall have it quickly, and more beating,\n  You have stolne away a Lady Captaine Coward,\n  And such a one.\n\n_Bes_.\n\n  Hold, I beseech you, hold Sir,\n  I never yet stole any living thing\n  That had a tooth about it.\n\n_Lig_.\n\n  Sir I know you dare lie\n  With none but Summer Whores upon my life Sir.\n\n_Bes_.\n\n  My meanes and manners never could attempt\n  Above a hedge or hey-cocke.\n\n_Lig_.\n\n  Sirra that quits not me, where is this Ladie,\n  Doe that you doe not use to doe, tell truth,\n  Or by my hand Ile beat your Captaines braines out.\n  Wash um, and put um in againe, that will I.\n\n_Bes_.\n\n  There was a Ladie Sir, I must confesse\n  Once in my charge: the Prince _Tigranes_  gave her\n  To my guard for her safetie, how I usd her\n  She may her selfe report, shee's with the Prince now:\n  I did but waite upon her like a Groome,\n  Which she will testifie I am sure: If not,\n  My braines are at your service when you please Sir,\n  And glad I have um for you?\n\n_Lig_.\n\n  This is most likely, Sir I aske your pardon,\n  And am sorrie I was so intemperate.\n\n_Bes_.\n\nWell, I can aske no more, you would thinke it strange Now to have\nme beat you at first sight.\n\n_Lig_.\n\n  Indeed I would but I know your goodnes can forget\n  Twentie beatings. You must forgive me.\n\n_Bes_.\n\n  Yes, ther's my hand, goe where you will, I shall thinke\n  You a valiant fellow for all this.\n\n_Lig_.\n\n  My daughter is a Whore,\n  I feele it now too sencible; yet I will see her,\n  Discharge my selfe of being Father to her,\n  And then backe to my Countrie, and there die;\n  Farewell Captaine.\n\n                                                     _Exit_.\n\n_Bes_.\n\n  Farewell Sir, farewell, commend me to the Gentlewoman I praia.\n\n_1_.\n\n  How now Captaine, beare up man.\n\n_Bes_.\n\n  Gentlemen ath' sword your hands once more, I have\n  Beene kickt againe, but the foolish fellow is penitent,\n  Has ask't me mercy, and my honor's safe.\n\n_2_.\n\n  We knew that, or the foolish fellow had better a kick't\n  His Grandsire.\n  Confirme, confirme I pray.\n\n_1_.\n\n  There be our hands againe.\n\n_2_.\n\n  Now let him come, and say he was not sorry,\n  And he sleepes for it.\n\n_Bes_.\n\n  Alas good ignorant old man, let him goe,\n  Let him goe, these courses will undoe him.\n\n                                                   _Exeunt_.\n\n_Enter Ligones, and Bacurius_.\n\n_Bac_.\n\n  My Lord your authoritie is good, and I am glad it is so, for my\n  consent would never hinder you from seeing your owne King. I am a\n  Minister, but not a governour of this state; yonder is your King,\n  Ile leave you.\n\n                                                     _Exit_.\n\n_Lig_.\n\n  There he is indeed, _Enter Tig. and Spaco_.\n  And with him my disloyall childe.\n\n_Tig_.\n\n  I doe perceive my fault so much, that yet\n  Me thinkes thou shouldst not have forgiven me.\n\n_Lig_.\n\n  Health to your Maiestie.\n\n_Tig_.\n\n  What? good Ligones, welcome; what businesse brought thee hether?\n\n_Lig_.\n\n  Severall Businesses.\n  My publique businesse will appeare by this:\n  I have a message to deliver, which\n  If it please you so to authorise, is\n  An embassage from the Armenian state,\n  Unto _Arbaces_  for your libertie:\n  The offer's there set downe, please you to read it.\n\n_Tig_.\n\n  There is no alteration happened\n  Since I came thence?\n\n_Lig_.\n\n  None Sir, all is as it was.\n\n_Tig_.\n\n  And all our friends are well.\n\n_Lig_.\n\n  All verie well.\n\n_Spa_.\n\n  Though I have done nothing but what was good,\n  I dare not see my Father: it was fault\n  Enough not to acquaint him with that good.\n\n_Lig_.\n\n  Madam I should have scene you.\n\n_Spa_.\n\n  O good Sir forgive me.\n\n_Lig_.\n\n  Forgive you, why I am no kin to you, am I?\n\n_Spa_.\n\n  Should it be measur'd by my meane deserts,\n  Indeed you are not.\n\n_Lig_.\n\n  Thou couldst prate unhappily\n  Ere thou couldst goe, would thou couldst doe as well.\n  And how does your custome hold out here. _Spa_. Sir.\n\n_Lig_.\n\n  Are you in private still, or how?\n\n_Spa_.\n\n  What doe you meane?\n\n_Lig_.\n\n  Doe you take money? are you come to sell sinne yet? perhaps I can\n  helpe you to liberall Clients: or has not the King cast you off yet? O\n  thou wild creature, whose best commendation is, that thou art a young\n  Whore. I would thy Mother had liv'd to see this: or rather would I had\n  dyed ere I had seene it: why did'st not make me acquainted when thou\n  wert first resolv'd to be a Whore? I would have seene thy hot lust\n  satisfied more privately. I would have kept a dancer, and a whole\n  consort of Musitions in mine owne house, onely to fiddle thee. _Spa_.\n  Sir I was never whore.\n\n_Lig_.\n\n  If thou couldst not say so much for thy selfe thou shouldst be\n  Carted.\n\n_Tig._\n\n  _Ligones_  I have read it, and like it,\n  You shall deliver it.\n\n_Lig_.\n\n  Well Sir I will: but I have private busines with you.\n\n_Tig_.\n\n  Speake, what ist?\n\n_Lig_.\n\n  How has my age deserv'd so ill of you,\n  That you can picke no strumpets in the Land,\n  But out of my breed.\n\n_Tig_.\n\n  Strumpets good _Ligones_?\n\n_Lig_.\n\n  Yes, and I wish to have you know, I scorne\n  To get a Whore for any Prince alive,\n  And yet scorne will not helpe me thinkes: My daughter\n  Might have beene spar'd, there were enough beside.\n\n_Tig_.\n\n  May I not prosper, but Shee's innocent\n  As morning light for me, and I dare sweare\n  For all the world.\n\n_Lig_.\n\n  Why is she with you then?\n  Can she waite on you better then your men,\n  Has she a gift in plucking off your stockings,\n  Can she make Cawdles well, or cut your Comes,\n  Why doe you keepe her with you? For your Queene\n  I know you doe contemne her, so should I\n  And every Subject else thinke much at it.\n\n_Tig_.\n\n  Let um thinke much, but tis more firme then earth\n  Thou seest thy Queene there.\n\n_Lig_.\n\n  Then have I made a faire hand, I cald her Whore,\n  If I shall speake now as her Father, I cannot chuse\n  But greatly rejoyce that she shall be a Queene: but if\n  I should speake to you as a Statesman shee were more fit\n  To be your Whore.\n\n_Tig_.\n\n  Get you about your businesse to _Arbaces_,\n  Now you talke idlie.\n\n_Lig_.\n\n  Yes Sir, I will goe.\n  And shall she be a Queene, she had more wit\n  Then her old Father when she ranne away:\n  Shall shee be a Queene, now by my troth tis fine,\n  Ile dance out of all measure at her wedding:\n  Shall I not Sir?\n\n_Tigr_.\n\n  Yes marrie shalt thou.\n\n_Lig_.\n\n  He make these witherd Kexes beare my bodie\n  Two houres together above ground.\n\n_Tigr_.\n\n  Nay, goe, my businesse requires haste.\n\n_Lig_.\n\n  Good God preserve you, you are an excellent King.\n\n_Spa_.\n\n  Farewell good Father.\n\n_Lig_.\n\n  Farewell sweete vertuous Daughter;\n  I never was so joyfull in my life,\n  That I remember: shall shee be a Queene?\n  Now I perceive a man may weepe for joy,\n  I had thought they had lied that said so.\n\n                                                     _Exit_.\n\n_Tig_.\n\n  Come my deare love.\n\n_Spa_.\n\n  But you may see another\n  May alter that againe.\n\n_Tigr_.\n\n  Urge it no more;\n  I have made up a new strong constancie,\n  Not to be shooke with eyes; I know I have\n  The passions of a man, but if I meete\n  With any subject that shall hold my eyes\n  More firmely then is fit; Ile thinke of thee,\n  and runne away from it: let that suffice.\n\n                                                   _Exeunt_.\n\n_Enter Bacurius, and a servant_.\n\n_Bac_.\n\n  Three gentlemen without to speake with me?\n\n_Ser_.\n\n  Yes Sir.\n\n_Bac_.\n\n  Let them come in.\n\n_Ser_.\n\n  They are enterd Sir already.\n\n_Enter Bessus, and Swordmen_.\n\n_Bac_.\n\n  Now fellowes, your busines, are these the Gentlemen.\n\n_Bess_.\n\n  My Lord I have made bold to bring these Gentlemen my Friends ath'\n  sword along with me.\n\n_Bac_.\n\n  I am afraid youle fight then.\n\n_Bes_.\n\n  My good Lord I will not, your Lordship is mistaken,\n  Feare not Lord.\n\n_Bac_.\n\n  Sir I am sorrie fort.\n\n_Bes_.\n\n  I can aske no more in honor, Gentlemen you heare my Lord is sorrie.\n\n_Bac_.\n\n  Not that I have beaten you, but beaten one that will be beaten:\n  one whose dull bodie will require launcing: As surfeits doe the\n  diet, spring and full. Now to your swordmen, what come they for\n  good Captaine Stock-fish?\n\n_Bes_.\n\n  It seemes your Lordship has forgot my name.\n\n_Bac_.\n\n  No, nor your nature neither, though they are things fitter I\n  confesse for anything, then my remembrance, or anie honestmans,\n  what shall these billets doe, be pilde up in my Wood-yard?\n\n_Bes_.\n\n  Your Lordship holds your mirth still, God continue it: but for\n  these Gentlemen they come.\n\n_Bac_.\n\n  To sweare you are a Coward, spare your Booke, I doe beleeve it.\n\n_Bes_.\n\n  Your Lordship still drawes wide, they come to vouch under their\n  valiant hands, I am no Coward.\n\n_Bac_.\n\n  That would be a shew indeed worth seeing: sirra be wise and take\n  money for this motion, travell with it, and where the name of\n  _Bessus_  has been knowne, or a good Coward stirring, twill yeeld\n  more then a tilting. This will prove more beneficiall to you, if\n  you be thriftie, then your Captaineship, and more naturall; Men\n  of most valiant hands is this true?\n\n_2_.\n\n  It is so most renowned,\n  Tis somewhat strange.\n\n_1_.\n\n  Lord, it is strange, yet true; wee have examined from your Lordships\n  foote there to this mans head, the nature of the beatings; and we doe\n  find his honour is come off cleane, and sufficient: This as our swords\n  shall helpe us.\n\n_Bac_.\n\n  You are much bound to you bilbow-men, I am glad you are straight again\n  Captaine: twere good you would thinke some way to gratifie them, they\n  have undergone a labour for you _Bessus_, would have puzzled _hercules_,\n  with all his valour.\n\n_2_.\n\n  Your Lordship must understand we are no men ath' Law, that take pay\n  for our opinions: it is sufficient wee have cleer'd our friend.\n\n_Bac_.\n\n  Yet here is something due, which I as toucht in conscience will\n  discharge Captaine; Ile pay this rent for you.\n\n_Bess_.\n\n  Spare your selfe my good Lord; my brave friends aime at nothing but\n  the vertue.\n\n_Bac_.\n\n  Thats but a cold discharge Sir for their paines.\n\n_2_.\n\n  O Lord, my good Lord.\n\n_Bac_.\n\n  Be not so modest, I will give you something.\n\n_Bes_.\n\n  They shall dine with your Lordship, that's sufficient.\n\n_Bac_.\n\n  Something in hand the while; ye rogues, ye apple-squiers: doe you\n  come hether with your botled valour, your windie frothe, to limit\n  out my beatings.\n\n_1_.\n\n  I doe beseech your Lordship.\n\n_2_.\n\n  O good Lord.\n\n_Bac_.\n\n  Sfoote, what a many of beaten slaves are here? get me a cudgell\n  sirra, and a tough one.\n\n_2_.\n\n  More of your foot, I doe beseech your Lordship.\n\n_Bac_.\n\n  You shall, you shall dog, and your fellow beagle.\n\n_1_.\n\n  A this side good my Lord.\n\n_Bac_.\n\n  Off with your swords, for if you hurt my foote, Ile have you\n  fleade you rascals.\n\n_1_.\n\n  Mines off my Lord.\n\n_2_.\n\n  I beseech your Lordship stay a little, my strap's tied to my\n  codpiece point: Now when you please.\n\n_Bac_.\n\n  Captaine, these are your valiant friends, you long for a little\n  too?\n\n_Bess_.\n\n  I am verie well, I humblie thanke your Lordship.\n\n_Bac_.\n\n  Whats that in your pocket slave, my key you mungrell? thy\n  buttocks cannot be so hard, out with't quicklie.\n\n_2_.\n\n  Here tis Sir, a small piece of Artillerie, that a gentleman a\n  deare friend of your Lordships sent me with to get it mended Sir;\n  for it you marke, the nose is somewhat loose.\n\n_Bac_.\n\n  A friend of mine you rascall, I was never wearier of doing\n  nothing, then kicking these two foote-bals.\n\n_Ser_.\n\n  Heres a good cudgell Sir.\n\n_Bac_.\n\n  It comes too late; I am wearie, prethee doe thou beate um.\n\n_2_.\n\n  My Lord this is foule play ifaith, to put a fresh man upon us;\n  Men, are but men.\n\n_Bac_.\n\n  That jest shall save your bones, up with your rotten regiment,\n  and be gone; I had rather thresh, then be bound to kicke these\n  raskals, till they cride hold: _Bessus_  you may put your hand to\n  them now, and then you are quit.

Have I preserv'd you from a childe,\n  From all the arrowes, malice or ambition\n  Could shoot at you, and have I this for pay?\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  Tis true thou didst preserve me, and in that\n  Wert crueller then hardned murderers\n  Of infants and their mothers; thou didst save me\n  Onely till thou hadst studdied out a way\n  How to destroy me cunningly thy selfe:\n  This was a curious way of torturing.\n\n_Gob_.\n\n  What doe you meane?\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  Thou knowst the evils thou hast done to me,\n  Dost thou remember all those witching letters\n  Thou sentst unto me to _Armenia_,\n  Fild with the praise of my beloved Sister,\n  Where thou extolst her beautie; what had I\n  To doe with that, what could her beautie be\n  To me, and thou didst write how well shee lov'd me,\n  Doest thou remember this: so that I doated\n  Something before I saw her.\n\n_Gob_.\n\n  This is true.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  Is it, and I when I was returnd thou knowst\n  Thou didst pursue it, till thou woundst mee into\n  Such a strange, and unbeleev'd affection,\n  As good men cannot thinke on.\n\n_Gob_.\n\n  This I grant, I thinke I was the cause.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  Wert thou? Nay more, I thinke thou meantst it.\n\n_Gob_.\n\n  Sir I hate a lie.\n  As I love God and honestie, I did:\n  It was my meaning.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  Be thine owne sad Judge,\n  A further condemnation will not need:\n  Prepare thy selfe to die.\n\n_Gob_.\n\n  Why Sir to die?\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  Why wouldst thou live, was ever yet offender\n  So impudent, that had a thought of mercy\n  After confession of a crime like this?\n  Get out I cannot, where thou hurlst me in,\n  But I can take revenge, that's all the sweetnesse\n  Left for me.\n\n_Gob_.\n\n  Now is the time, heare me but speake.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  No, yet I will be farre more mercifull\n  Then thou wert to me; thou didst steale into me,\n  And never gavest me warning: so much time\n  As I give thee now, had prevented thee\n  For ever. Notwithstanding all thy sinnes,\n  If thou hast hope, that there is yet a prayer\n  To save thee, turne, and speake it to your selfe.\n\n_Gob_.\n\n  Sir, you shall know your sinnes before you doe um\n  If you kill me.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  I will not stay then.\n\n_Gob_.\n\n  Know you kill your Father.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  How?\n\n_Gob_.\n\n  You kill your Father.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  My Father? though I know it for a lie\n  Made out of feare to save thy stained life:\n  The verie reverence of the word comes crosse me,\n  And ties mine arme downe.\n\n_Gob_.\n\n  I will tell you that shall heighten you againe, I am thy\n  Father, I charge thee heare me.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  If it should be so,\n  As tis most false, and that I should be found\n  A bastard issue, the dispised fruite\n  Of lawlesse lust, I should no more admire\n  All my wilde passions: but another truth\n  Shall be wrung from thee: If I could come by\n  The spirit of paine, it should be powr'd on thee,\n  Till thou allowest thy selfe more full of lies\n  Then he that teaches thee.\n\n  _Enter Arane_.\n\n_Arane_.\n\n  Turne thee about,\n  I come to speake to thee thou wicked man,\n  Heare me thou Tyrant.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  I will turne to thee,\n  Heare me thou Strumpet: I have blotted out\n  The name of mother, as thou hast thy shame.\n\n_Ara_.\n\n  My shame, thou hast lesse shame then anything:\n  Why dost thou keepe my daughter in a prison?\n  Why dost thou call her Sister, and doe this?\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  Cease thou strange impudence, and answere quickly,\n  If thou contemn'st me, this will aske an answere,\n  And have it.\n\n_Ara_.\n\n  Helpe me gentle _Gobrius_.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  Guilt dare not helpe guilt, though they grow together\n  In doing ill, yet at the punishment\n  They sever, and each flies the noyse of other,\n  Thinke not of helpe, answere.\n\n_Ara_.\n\n  I will, to what?\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  To such a thing as if it be a truth,\n  Thinke what a creature thou hast made thy selfe,\n  That didst not shame to doe, what I must blush\n  Onely to aske thee: tell me who I am,\n  Whose sonne I am, without all circumstance;\n  Be thou as hastie, as my Sword will be\n  If thou refusest.\n\n_Ara_.\n\n  Why you are his sonne.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  His sonne?\n  Sweare, sweare, thou worse then woman damn'd.\n\n_Ara_.\n\n  By all thats good you are.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  Then art thou all that ever was knowne bad. Now is\n  The cause of all my strange misfortunes come to light:\n  What reverence expects thou from a childe\n  To bring forth which thou hast offended Heaven,\n  Thy husband and the Land: Adulterous witch\n  I know now why thou wouldst have poyson'd me,\n  I was thy lust which thou wouldst have forgot:\n  Thou wicked mother of my sinnes, and me,\n  Shew me the way to the inheritance\n  I have by thee: which is a spacious world\n  Of impious acts, that I may soone possesse it:\n  Plagues rott thee, as thou liv'st, and such diseases\n  As use to pay lust, recompence thy deed.\n\n_Gob_.\n\n  You doe not know why you curse thus.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  Too well:\n  You are a paire of Vipers, and behold\n  The Serpent you have got; there is no beast\n  But if he knew, it has a pedigree\n  As brave as mine, for they have more discents,\n  And I am every way as beastly got,\n  As farre without the compasse of a law,\n  As they.\n\n_Ara_.\n\n  You spend your rage, and words in vaine,\n  And raile upon a guesse: heare us a little.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  No I will never heare, but talke away\n  My breath, and die.\n\n_Gob_.\n\n  Why but you are no Bastard.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  Howe's that?\n\n_Ara_.\n\n  Nor childe of mine.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  Still you goe on in wonders to me.\n\n_Gob_.\n\n  Pray be more patient, I may bring comfort to you.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  I will kneele,\n  And heare with the obedience of a childe;\n  Good Father speake, I doe acknowledge you,\n  So you bring comfort.\n\n_Gob_.\n\n  First know our last King your supposed Father\n  Was olde and feeble when he marryed her,\n  And almost all the Land as shee past hope\n  Of issue from him.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  Therefore shee tooke leave\n  To play the whoore, because the King was old:\n  Is this the comfort?\n\n_Ara_.\n\n  What will you find out\n  To give me satisfaction, when you find\n  How you have injur'd me: let fire consume mee,\n  If ever I were whore.\n\n_Gob_.\n\n  Forbeare these starts,\n  Or I will leave you wedded to despaire,\n  As you are now: if you can find a temper,\n  My breath shall be a pleasant westerne wind,\n  That cooles, and blastes not.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  Bring it out good Father,\n  He lie, artd listen here as reverentlie\n  As to an Angell: If I breathe too loude,\n  Tell me; for I would be as still as night.\n\n_Gob_.\n\n  Our King I say was old, and this our Queene\n  Desired to bring an heire; but yet her husband\n  Shee thought was past it, and to be dishonest\n  I thinke shee would not; if shee would have beene,\n  The truth is, shee was watcht so narrowlie,\n  And had so slender opportunitie,\n  Shee hardly could have beene: But yet her cunning\n  Found out this way; shee fain'd her selfe with child,\n  And postes were sent in haste throughout the Land,\n  And God was humbly thankt in every Church,\n  That so had blest the Queen, and prayers were made\n  For her safe going, and deliverie:\n  Shee fain'd now to grow bigger, and perceiv'd\n  This hope of issue made her feard, and brought\n  A farre more large respect from everie man.\n  And saw her power increase, and was resolv'd,\n  Since shee believ'd shee could not have't indeede;\n  At least shee would be thought to have a child.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  Doe I not heare it well: nay, I will make\n  No noise at all; but pray you to the point,\n  Quicke as you can.\n\n_Gob_.\n\n  Now when the time was full,\n  Shee should be brought abed; I had a sonne\n  Borne, which was you: This the Queene hearing of,\n  Mov'd me to let her have you, and such reasons\n  Shee shewed me, as shee knew would tie\n  My secresie: shee sware you should be King;\n  And to be short, I did deliver you\n  Unto her, and pretended you were dead;\n  And in mine owne house kept a Funerall,\n  And had an emptie coffin put in earth:\n  That night the Queene fain'd hastilie to labour,\n  And by a paire of women of her owne,\n  Which shee had charm'd, shee made the world believe\n  Shee was deliver'd of you: you grew up\n  As the Kings sonne, till you were six yeere olde;\n  Then did the King die, and did leave to me\n  Protection of the Realme; and contrarie\n  To his owne expectation, left this Queene\n  Truly with Childe indeed of the faire Princesse\n  _Panthea_: Then shee could have torne her heire,\n  And did alone to me yet durst not speake\n  In publike; for shee knew shee should be found\n  A Traytor, and her talke would have beene thought\n  Madnesse or any thing rather then truth:\n  This was the onely cause why shee did seeke\n  To poyson you, and I to keepe you safe:\n  And this the reason why I sought to kindle\n  Some sparke of love in you to faire _Panthea_,\n  That shee might get part of her right agen.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  And have you made an end now, is this all?\n  If not, I will be still till I am aged,\n  Till all my heires are silver.\n\n_Gob_.\n\n  This is all.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  And is it true say you Maddam?\n\n_Ara_.\n\n  Yes, God knowes it is most true.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  _Panthea_  then is not my Sister.\n\n_Gob_.\n\n  No.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  But can you prove this?\n\n[_Gob_.]\n\n  If you will give consent: else who dare goe about it.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  Give consent?\n  Why I will have them all that know it rackt\n  To get this from um: All that waites without\n  Come in, what ere you be come in, and be\n  Partakers of my Joy: O you are welcome.\n\n         _Ent. Mar: Bessus, and others_.\n\n  _Mardonius_  the best newes, nay, draw no neerer\n  They all shall heare it: I am found no King.\n\n_Mar_.\n\n  Is that so good newes?\n\n_Art_.\n\n  Yes, the happiest newes that ere was heard.\n\n_Mar_.\n\n  Indeed twere well for you,\n  If you might be a little lesse obey'd.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  On, call the Queene.\n\n_Mar_.\n\n  Why she is there.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  The Queene _Mardonius_, _Panthea_  is the Queene,\n  And I am plaine _Arbaces_, goe some one,\n  She is in _Gobrius_  house; since I saw you\n  There are a thousand things delivered to me\n  You little dreame of.\n\n_Mar_.\n\n  So it should seeme: My Lord,\n  What furi's this.\n\n_Gob_.\n\n  Beleeve me tis no fury,\n  All that he sayes is truth.\n\n_Mar_.\n\n  Tis verie strange.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  Why doe you keepe your hats off Gentlemen,\n  Is it to me? in good faith it must not be:\n  I cannot now command you, but I pray you\n  For the respect you bare me, when you tooke\n  Me for your King, each man clap on his hat at my desire.\n\n_Mar_.\n\n  We will: but you are not found\n  So meane a man, but that you may be cover'd\n  As well as we, may you not?\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  O not here,\n  You may, but not I, for here is my Father in presence.\n\n_Mar_.\n\n  Where?\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  Why there: O the whole storie\n  Would be a wildernesse to loose thy selfe\n  For ever; O pardon me deare Father,\n  For all the idle, and unreverent words\n  That I have spoke in idle moodes to you:\n  I am _Arbaces_, we all fellow subjects,\n  Nor is the Queene _Panthea_  now my Sister.\n\n_Bes_.\n\n  Why if you remember fellow subject _Arbaces_, I tolde you once\n  she was not your sister, I say she look't nothing like you.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  I thinke you did good Captaine _Bessus_.\n\n_Bes_.\n\n  Here will arise another question now amongst the Swordmen,\n  whether I be to call him to account for beating me, now he's\n  prov'd no King.\n\n                     _Enter Ligones_.\n\n_Ma_.\n\n  Sir, heres _Ligones_\n  The Agent for the Armenian King.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  Where is he, I know your businesse good _Ligones_.\n\n_Lig_.\n\n  We must have our King againe, and will.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  I knew that was your businesse, you shall have\n  You King againe, and have him so againe\n  As never King was had. Goe one of you\n  And bid _Bacurius_  bring _Tigranes_  hither,\n  And bring the Ladie with him, that _Panthea_\n  The Queene _Panthea_  sent me word this morning\n  Was brave _Tigranes_  mistresse.\n\n_Lig_.\n\n  Tis _Spaconia_.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  I, I, _Spaconia_.\n\n_Lig_.\n\n  She is my daughter.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  Shee is so, I could now tell any thing\n  I never heard; your King shall goe so home\n  As never man went.\n\n_Mar_.\n\n  Shall he goe on's head?\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  He shall have Chariots easier than ayre\n  That I will have invented; and nere thinke\n  He shall pay any ransome; and thy selfe\n  That art the Messenger shall ride before him\n  On a Horse cut out of an entire Diamond,\n  That shall be made to goe with golden wheeles,\n  I know not how yet.\n\n_Lig_.\n\n  Why I shall be made\n  For ever, they belied this King with us\n  And sayd he was unkind.\n\n_Arb_.\n\n  And then thy daughter,\n  She shall have some strange thinke, wele have the Kingdome\n  Sold utterly, and put into a toy.\n  Which she shall weare about her carelesly\n  Some where or other.\n  See the vertuous Queene.\n\n              _Enter Pan_.\n\n  Behold the humblest subject that you have\n  Kneele here before you. _Pan_.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp:\/\/pglaf.org\/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\ninformation can be found at the Foundation's web site and official\npage at http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nEach eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's\neBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,\ncompressed (zipped), HTML and others.\n\nCorrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over\nthe old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.\nVERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving\nnew filenames and etext numbers.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n\nEBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,\nare filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to\ndownload any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular\nsearch system you may utilize the following addresses and just\ndownload by the etext year.\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\/etext06\n\n    (Or \/etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,\n     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)\n\nEBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are\nfiled in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part\nof the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is\nidentical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single\ndigits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For\nexample an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\/1\/0\/2\/3\/10234\n\nor filename 24689 would be found at:\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\/2\/4\/6\/8\/24689\n\nAn alternative method of locating eBooks:\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\/GUTINDEX.ALL\n\n","id":1339,"split":"test"}
