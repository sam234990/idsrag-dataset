I hadn't read three pages when I saw what you will no doubt see\nat once--that the story had been written by a girl. And as I went on I\nsaw that the work was Australian--born of the bush. I don't know about\nthe girlishly emotional parts of the book--I leave that to girl readers\nto judge; but the descriptions of bush life and scenery came\nstartlingly, painfully real to me, and I know that, as far as they are\nconcerned, the book is true to Australia--the truest I ever read. I\nwrote to Miles Franklin, and she confessed that she was a girl. I saw\nher before leaving Sydney. She is just a little bush girl, barely\ntwenty-one yet, and has scarcely ever been out of the bush in her life.\nShe has lived her book, and I feel proud of it for the sake of the\ncountry I came from, where people toil and bake and suffer and are kind;\nwhere every second sun-burnt bushman is a sympathetic humorist, with the\nsadness of the bush deep in his eyes and a brave grin for the worst of\ntimes, and where every third bushman is a poet, with a big heart that\nkeeps his pockets empty.\n\nHENRY LAWSON\n\nEngland, April 1901\n\n\n\n\nCONTENTS\n\n  CHAPTER\n\n  INTRODUCTION\n\n  ONE.

Wales, Australia, 1st March, 1899_\n\n_MY DEAR FELLOW AUSTRALIANS,_\n\n_Just a few lines to tell you that this story is all about myself--for\nno other purpose do I write it._\n\n_I make no apologies for being egotistical. In this particular I attempt\nan improvement on other autobiographies. Other autobiographies weary one\nwith excuses for their egotism. What matters it to you if I am\negotistical? What matters it to you though it should matter that I am\negotistical?_\n\n_This is not a romance--I have too often faced the music of life to the\ntune of hardship to waste time in snivelling and gushing over fancies\nand dreams; neither is it a novel, but simply a yarn--a _real_ yarn. Oh!\nas real, as really real--provided life itself is anything beyond a\nheartless little chimera--it is as real in its weariness and bitter\nheartache as the tall gum-trees, among which I first saw the light, are\nreal in their stateliness and substantiality._\n\n_My sphere in life is not congenial to me. Oh, how I hate this living\ndeath which has swallowed all my teens, which is greedily devouring my\nyouth, which will sap my prime, and in which my old age, if I am cursed\nwith any, will be worn away! As my life creeps on for ever through the\nlong toil-laden days with its agonizing monotony, narrowness, and\nabsolute uncongeniality, how my spirit frets and champs its unbreakable\nfetters--all in vain!_\n\n\nSPECIAL NOTICE\n\nYou can dive into this story head first as it were. Do not fear\nencountering such trash as descriptions of beautiful sunsets and\nwhisperings of wind. We (999 out of every 1000) can see nought in\nsunsets save as signs and tokens whether we may expect rain on the\nmorrow or the contrary, so we will leave such vain and foolish imagining\nto those poets and painters--poor fools! Let us rejoice that we are not\nof their temperament!\n\nBetter be born a slave than a poet, better be born a black, better be\nborn a cripple! For a poet must be companionless--alone! _fearfully_\nalone in the midst of his fellows whom he loves. Alone because his soul\nis as far above common mortals as common mortals are above monkeys.\n\n\n\nThere is no plot in this story, because there has been none in my life\nor in any other life which has come under my notice. I am one of a\nclass, the individuals of which have not time for plots in their life,\nbut have all they can do to get their work done without indulging in\nsuch a luxury.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nI Remember, I Remember\n\n\n\"Boo, hoo! Ow, ow; Oh! oh! Me'll die. Boo, hoo. The pain, the pain! Boo,\nhoo!\"\n\n\"Come, come, now. Daddy's little mate isn't going to turn Turk like\nthat, is she? I'll put some fat out of the dinner-bag on it, and tie it\nup in my hanky. Don't cry any more now. Hush, you must not cry! You'll\nmake old Dart buck if you kick up a row like that.\"\n\nThat is my first recollection of life. I was barely three. I can\nremember the majestic gum-trees surrounding us, the sun glinting on\ntheir straight white trunks, and falling on the gurgling fern-banked\nstream, which disappeared beneath a steep scrubby hill on our left. It\nwas an hour past noon on a long clear summer day. We were on a distant\npart of the run, where my father had come to deposit salt. He had left\nhome early in the dewy morning, carrying me in front of him on a little\nbrown pillow which my mother had made for the purpose. We had put the\nlumps of rock-salt in the troughs on the other side of the creek. The\nstringybark roof of the salt-shed which protected the troughs from rain\npeeped out picturesquely from the musk and peppercorn shrubs by which it\nwas densely surrounded, and was visible from where we lunched. I\nrefilled the quart-pot in which we had boiled our tea with water from\nthe creek, father doused our fire out with it, and then tied the quart\nto the D of his saddle with a piece of green hide. The green-hide bags\nin which the salt had been carried were hanging on the hooks of the\npack-saddle which encumbered the bay pack-horse. Father's saddle and the\nbrown pillow were on Dart, the big grey horse on which he generally\ncarried me, and we were on the point of making tracks for home.\n\n\nPreparatory to starting, father was muzzling the dogs which had just\nfinished what lunch we had left. This process, to which the dogs\nstrongly objected, was rendered necessary by a cogent reason. Father had\nbrought his strychnine flask with him that day, and in hopes of causing\nthe death of a few dingoes, had put strong doses of its contents in\nseveral dead beasts which we had come across.\n\nWhilst the dogs were being muzzled, I busied myself in plucking ferns\nand flowers. This disturbed a big black snake which was curled at the\nbutt of a tree fern.\n\n\"Bitey! bitey!\" I yelled, and father came to my rescue, despatching the\nreptile with his stock-whip. He had been smoking, and dropped his pipe\non the ferns. I picked it up, and the glowing embers which fell from it\nburnt my dirty little fat fists. Hence the noise with which my story\ncommences.\n\nIn all probability it was the burning of my fingers which so indelibly\nimpressed the incident on my infantile mind. My father was accustomed to\ntake me with him, but that is the only jaunt at that date which I\nremember, and that is all I remember of it. We were twelve miles from\nhome, but how we reached there I do not know.\n\nMy father was a swell in those days--held Bruggabrong, Bin Bin East, and\nBin Bin West, which three stations totalled close on 200,000 acres.\nFather was admitted into swelldom merely by right of his position. His\npedigree included nothing beyond a grandfather. My mother, however, was\na full-fledged aristocrat. She was one of the Bossiers of Caddagat, who\nnumbered among their ancestry one of the depraved old pirates who\npillaged England with William the Conqueror.\n\n\"Dick\" Melvyn was as renowned for hospitality as joviality, and our\ncomfortable, wide-veranda'ed, irregularly built, slab house in its\nsheltered nook amid the Timlinbilly Ranges was ever full to overflowing.\nDoctors, lawyers, squatters, commercial travellers, bankers,\njournalists, tourists, and men of all kinds and classes crowded our\nwell-spread board; but seldom a female face, except mother's, was to be\nseen there, Bruggabrong being a very out-of-the-way place.\n\nI was both the terror and the amusement of the station. Old\nboundary-riders and drovers inquire after me with interest to this day.\n\nI knew everyone's business, and was ever in danger of publishing it at\nan inopportune moment.\n\nIn flowery language, selected from slang used by the station hands, and\nlong words picked up from our visitors, I propounded unanswerable\nquestions which brought blushes to the cheeks of even tough old\nwine-bibbers.\n\nNothing would induce me to show more respect to an appraiser of the runs\nthan to a boundary-rider, or to a clergyman than a drover. I am the same\nto this day. My organ of veneration must be flatter than a pancake,\nbecause to venerate a person simply for his position I never did or\nwill. To me the Prince of Wales will be no more than a shearer, unless\nwhen I meet him he displays some personality apart from his\nprinceship--otherwise he can go hang.\n\nAuthentic record of the date when first I had a horse to myself has not\nbeen kept, but it must have been early, as at eight I was fit to ride\nanything on the place. Side-saddle, man-saddle, no-saddle, or astride\nwere all the same to me. I rode among the musterers as gamely as any of\nthe big sunburnt bushmen.\n\nMy mother remonstrated, opined I would be a great unwomanly tomboy. My\nfather poohed the idea.\n\n\"Let her alone, Lucy,\" he said, \"let her alone. The rubbishing\nconventionalities which are the curse of her sex will bother her soon\nenough. Let her alone!\"\n\nSo, smiling and saying, \"She should have been a boy,\" my mother let me\nalone, and I rode, and in comparison to my size made as much noise with\nmy stock-whip as any one. Accidents had no power over me, I came\nunscathed out of droves of them.\n\nFear I knew not. Did a drunken tramp happen to kick up a row, I was\nalways the first to confront him, and, from my majestic and roly-poly\nheight of two feet six inches, demand what he wanted.\n\nA digging started near us and was worked by a score of two dark-browed\nsons of Italy. They made mother nervous, and she averred they were not\nto be trusted, but I liked and trusted them. They carried me on their\nbroad shoulders, stuffed me with lollies and made a general pet of me.\nWithout the quiver of a nerve I swung down their deepest shafts in the\nbig bucket on the end of a rope attached to a rough windlass, which\nbrought up the miners and the mullock.\n\nMy brothers and sisters contracted mumps, measles, scarlatina, and\nwhooping-cough. I rolled in the bed with them yet came off scot-free. I\nromped with dogs, climbed trees after birds' nests, drove the bullocks\nin the dray, under the instructions of Ben, our bullocky, and always\naccompanied my father when he went swimming in the clear, mountain,\nshrub-lined stream which ran deep and lone among the weird gullies,\nthickly carpeted with maidenhair and numberless other species of ferns.\n\nMy mother shook her head over me and trembled for my future, but father\nseemed to consider me nothing unusual. He was my hero, confidant,\nencyclopedia, mate, and even my religion till I was ten. Since then I\nhave been religionless.\n\nRichard Melvyn, you were a fine fellow in those days! A kind and\nindulgent parent, a chivalrous husband, a capital host, a man full of\nambition and gentlemanliness.\n\n\n\nAmid these scenes, and the refinements and pleasures of Caddagat, which\nlies a hundred miles or so farther Riverinawards, I spent the first\nyears of my childhood.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER TWO\n\nAn Introduction to Possum Gully\n\n\nI was nearly nine summers old when my father conceived the idea that he\nwas wasting his talents by keeping them rolled up in the small napkin of\nan out-of-the-way place like Bruggabrong and the Bin Bin stations.\nTherefore he determined to take up his residence in a locality where he\nwould have more scope for his ability.\n\nWhen giving his reason for moving to my mother, he put the matter before\nher thus: The price of cattle and horses had fallen so of late years\nthat it was impossible to make much of a living by breeding them. Sheep\nwere the only profitable article to have nowadays, and it would be\nimpossible to run them on Bruggabrong or either of the Bin Bins. The\ndingoes would work havoc among them in no time, and what they left the\nduffers would soon dispose of. As for bringing police into the matter,\nit would be worse than useless. They could not run the offenders to\nearth, and their efforts to do so would bring down upon their employer\nthe wrath of the duffers. Result, all the fences on the station would be\nfired for a dead certainty, and the destruction of more than a hundred\nmiles of heavy log fencing on rough country like Bruggabrong was no\npicnic to contemplate.\n\nThis was the feasible light in which father shaded his desire to leave.\nThe fact of the matter was that the heartless harridan, discontent, had\nlaid her claw-like hand upon him. His guests were ever assuring him he\nwas buried and wasted in Timlinbilly's gullies. A man of his\nintelligence, coupled with his wonderful experience among stock, would,\nthey averred, make a name and fortune for himself dealing or\nauctioneering if he only liked to try. Richard Melvyn began to think so\ntoo, and desired to try. He did try.\n\nHe gave up Bruggabrong, Bin Bin East and Bin Bin West, bought Possum\nGully, a small farm of one thousand acres, and brought us all to live\nnear Goulburn. Here we arrived one autumn afternoon. Father, mother, and\nchildren packed in the buggy, myself, and the one servant-girl, who had\naccompanied us, on horseback. The one man father had retained in his\nservice was awaiting our arrival. He had preceded us with a\nbullock-drayload of furniture and belongings, which was all father had\nretained of his household property. Just sufficient for us to get along\nwith, until he had time to settle and purchase more, he said. That was\nten years ago, and that is the only furniture we possess yet--just\nenough to get along with.\n\nMy first impression of Possum Gully was bitter disappointment--an\nimpression which time has failed to soften or wipe away.\n\nHow flat, common, and monotonous the scenery appeared after the rugged\npeaks of the Timlinbilly Range!\n\nOur new house was a ten-roomed wooden structure, built on a barren\nhillside. Crooked stunted gums and stringybarks, with a thick underscrub\nof wild cherry, hop, and hybrid wattle, clothed the spurs which ran up\nfrom the back of the detached kitchen. Away from the front of the house\nwere flats, bearing evidence of cultivation, but a drop of water was\nnowhere to be seen. Later, we discovered a few round, deep, weedy\nwaterholes down on the flat, which in rainy weather swelled to a stream\nwhich swept all before it. Possum Gully is one of the best watered spots\nin the district, and in that respect has stood to its guns in the\nbitterest drought. Use and knowledge have taught us the full value of\nits fairly clear and beautifully soft water. Just then, however, coming\nfrom the mountains where every gully had its limpid creek, we turned in\ndisgust from the idea of having to drink this water.\n\nI felt cramped on our new run. It was only three miles wide at its\nbroadest point. Was I always, always, always to live here, and never,\nnever, never to go back to Bruggabrong? That was the burden of the grief\nwith which I sobbed myself to sleep on the first night after our\narrival.\n\nMother felt dubious of her husband's ability to make a living off a\nthousand acres, half of which were fit to run nothing but wallabies, but\nfather was full of plans, and very sanguine concerning his future. He\nwas not going to squat henlike on his place as the cockies around him\ndid. He meant to deal in stock making of Possum Gully merely a depot on\nwhich to run some of his bargains until reselling.\n\nDear, oh dear! It was terrible to think he had wasted the greater part\nof his life among the hills where the mail came but once a week, and\nwhere the nearest town, of 650 inhabitants, was forty-six miles distant.\nAnd the road had been impassable for vehicles. Here, only seventeen\nmiles from a city like Goulburn, with splendid roads, mail thrice\nweekly, and a railway platform only eight miles away, why, man, my\nfortune is made! Such were the sentiments to which he gave birth out of\nthe fullness of his hopeful heart.\n\nEre the diggings had broken out on Bruggabrong, our nearest neighbour,\nexcepting, of course, boundary-riders, was seventeen miles distant.\nPossum Gully was a thickly populated district, and here we were\nsurrounded by homes ranging from half a mile to two and three miles\naway. This was a new experience for us, and it took us some time to\nbecome accustomed to the advantage and disadvantage of the situation.\nDid we require an article, we found it handy, but decidedly the reverse\nwhen our neighbours borrowed from us, and, in the greater percentage of\ncases, failed to return the loan.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THREE\n\nA Lifeless Life\n\n\nPossum Gully was stagnant--stagnant with the narrow stagnation prevalent\nin all old country places.\n\nIts residents were principally married folk and children under sixteen.\nThe boys, as they attained manhood, drifted outback to shear, drove, or\nto take up land. They found it too slow at home, and besides there was\nnot room enough for them there when they passed childhood.\n\nNothing ever happened there. Time was no object, and the days slid\nquietly into the river of years, distinguished one from another by name\nalone. An occasional birth or death was a big event, and the biggest\nevent of all was the advent of a new resident.\n\nWhen such a thing occurred it was customary for all the male heads of\nfamilies to pay a visit of inspection, to judge if the new-comers were\nworthy of admittance into the bosom of the society of the neighbourhood.\nShould their report prove favourable, then their wives finished the\nceremony of inauguration by paying a friendly visit.\n\nAfter his arrival at Possum Gully father was much away on business, and\nso on my mother fell the ordeal of receiving the callers, male and\nfemale.\n\nThe men were honest, good-natured, respectable, common bushmen farmers.\nToo friendly to pay a short call, they came and sat for hours yarning\nabout nothing in particular. This bored my gentle mother excessively.\nShe attempted to entertain them with conversation of current literature\nand subjects of the day, but her efforts fell flat. She might as well\nhave spoken in French.\n\nThey conversed for hours and hours about dairying, interspersed with\npointless anecdotes of the man who had lived there before us. I found\nthem very tame.\n\nAfter graphic descriptions of life on big stations outback, and the\ndashing snake yarns told by our kitchen-folk at Bruggabrong, and the\nanecdotes of African hunting, travel, and society life which had often\nformed our guests' subject of conversation, this endless fiddle-faddle\nof the price of farm produce and the state of crops was very fatuous.\n\nThose men, like everyone else, only talked shop. I say nothing in\ncondemnation of it, but merely point out that it did not then interest\nus, as we were not living in that shop just then.\n\nMrs Melvyn must have found favour in the eyes of the specimens of the\nlords of creation resident at Possum Gully, as all the matrons of the\ncommunity hastened to call on her, and vied with each other in a display\nof friendliness and good-nature. They brought presents of poultry, jam,\nbutter, and suchlike. They came at two o'clock and stayed till dark.\nThey inventoried the furniture, gave mother cookery recipes, described\nminutely the unsurpassable talents of each of their children, and\ndescanted volubly upon the best way of setting turkey hens. On taking\ntheir departure they cordially invited us all to return their visits,\nand begged mother to allow her children to spend a day with theirs.\n\nWe had been resident in our new quarters nearly a month when my parents\nreceived an intimation from the teacher of the public school, two miles\ndistant, to the effect that the law demanded that they should send their\nchildren to school. It upset my mother greatly. What was she to do?\n\n\"Do! Bundle the nippers off to school as quickly as possible, of\ncourse,\" said my father.\n\nMy mother objected. She proposed a governess now and a good\nboarding-school later on. She had heard such dreadful stories of public\nschools! It was terrible to be compelled to send her darlings to one;\nthey would be ruined in a week!\n\n\"Not they,\" said father. \"Run them off for a week or two, or a month at\nthe outside. They can't come to any harm in that time. After that we\nwill get a governess. You are in no state of health to worry about one\njust now, and it is utterly impossible that I can see about the matter\nat present. I have several specs. on foot that I must attend to. Send\nthe youngsters to school down here for the present.\"\n\nWe went to school, and in our dainty befrilled pinafores and light shoes\nwere regarded as great swells by the other scholars. They for the most\npart were the children of very poor farmers, whose farm earnings were\naugmented by road-work, wood-carting, or any such labour which came\nwithin their grasp. All the boys went barefooted, also a moiety of the\ngirls. The school was situated on a wild scrubby hill, and the teacher\nboarded with a resident a mile from it. He was a man addicted to drink,\nand the parents of his scholars lived in daily expectation of seeing his\ndismissal from the service.\n\nIt is nearly ten years since the twins (who came next to me) and I were\nenrolled as pupils of the Tiger Swamp public school. My education was\ncompleted there; so was that of the twins, who are eleven months younger\nthan I. Also my other brothers and sisters are quickly getting\nfinishedwards; but that is the only school any of us have seen or known.\nThere was even a time when father spoke of filling in the free forms for\nour attendance there. But mother--a woman's pride bears more wear than a\nman's--would never allow us to come to that.\n\nAll our neighbours were very friendly; but one in particular, a James\nBlackshaw, proved himself most desirous of being comradely with us. He\nwas a sort of self-constituted sheik of the community. It was usual for\nhim to take all new-comers under his wing, and with officious\ngood-nature endeavour to make them feel at home. He called on us daily,\ntied his horse to the paling fence beneath the shade of a sallie-tree in\nthe backyard, and when mother was unable to see him he was content to\nyarn for an hour or two with Jane Haizelip, our servant-girl.\n\nJane disliked Possum Gully as much as I did. Her feeling being much more\ndefined, it was amusing to hear the flat-out opinions she expressed to\nMr Blackshaw, whom, by the way, she termed \"a mooching hen of a chap\".\n\n\"I suppose, Jane, you like being here near Goulburn, better than that\nout-of-the-way place you came from,\" he said one morning as he\ncomfortably settled himself on an old sofa in the kitchen.\n\n\"No jolly fear. Out-of-the-way place! There was more life at Bruggabrong\nin a day than you crawlers 'ud see here all yer lives,\" she retorted\nwith vigour, energetically pommelling a batch of bread which she was\nmixing.\n\n\"Why, at Brugga it was as good as a show every week. On Saturday evening\nall the coves used to come in for their mail. They'd stay till Sunday\nevenin'. Splitters, boundary-riders, dogtrappers--every manjack of 'em.\nSome of us wuz always good fer a toon on the concertina, and the rest\nwould dance. We had fun to no end. A girl could have a fly round and a\nlark or two there I tell you; but here,\" and she emitted a snort of\ncontempt, \"there ain't one bloomin' feller to do a mash with. I'm full\nof the place. Only I promised to stick to the missus a while, I'd scoot\ntomorrer. It's the dead-and-alivest hole I ever seen.\"\n\n\"You'll git used to it by and by,\" said Blackshaw.\n\n\"Used to it! A person 'ud hev to be brought up onder a hen to git used\nto the dullness of this hole.\"\n\n\"You wasn't brought up under a hen, or it must have been a big Bramer\nPooter, if you were,\" replied he, noting the liberal proportions of her\nfigure as she hauled a couple of heavy pots off the fire. He did not\noffer to help her. Etiquette of that sort was beyond his ken.\n\n\"You oughter go out more and then you wouldn't find it so dull,\" he\nsaid, after she had placed the pots on the floor.\n\n\"Go out! Where 'ud I go to, pray?\"\n\n\"Drop in an' see my missus again when you git time. You're always\nwelcome.\"\n\n\"Thanks, but I had plenty of goin' to see your missus last time.\"\n\n\"How's that?\"\n\n\"Why, I wasn't there harf an hour wen she had to strip off her clean\nduds an' go an' milk. I don't think much of any of the men around here.\nThey let the women work too hard. I never see such a tired wore-out set\nof women. It puts me in mind ev the time wen the black fellers made the\ngins do all the work. Why, on Bruggabrong the women never had to do no\noutside work, only on a great pinch wen all the men were away at a fire\nor a muster. Down here they do everything. They do all the milkin', and\npig-feedin', and poddy-rarin'. It makes me feel fit to retch. I don't\nknow whether it's because the men is crawlers or whether it's dairyin'.\nI don't think much of dairyin'. It's slavin', an' delvin', an' scrapin'\nyer eyeballs out from mornin' to night, and nothink to show for your\npains; and now you'll oblige me, Mr Blackshaw, if youll lollop somewhere\nelse for a minute or two. I want to sweep under that sofer.\"\n\nThis had the effect of making him depart. He said good morning and went\noff, not sure whether he was most amused or insulted.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER FOUR\n\nA Career Which Soon Careered To An End\n\n\nWhile mother, Jane Haizelip, and I found the days long and life slow,\nfather was enjoying himself immensely.\n\nHe had embarked upon a lively career--that gambling trade known as\ndealing in stock.\n\nWhen he was not away in Riverina inspecting a flock of sheep, he was\nattending the Homebush Fat Stock Sales, rushing away out to Bourke, or\ntearing off down the Shoalhaven to buy some dairy heifers.\n\nHe was a familiar figure at the Goulburn sale-yards every Wednesday,\nalways going into town the day before and not returning till a day, and\noften two days, afterwards.\n\nHe was in great demand among drovers and auctioneers; and in the stock\nnews his name was always mentioned in connection with all the principal\nsales in the colony.\n\nIt takes an astute, clear-headed man to keep himself off shore in stock\ndealing. I never yet heard of a dealer who occasionally did not\ntemporarily, if not totally, go to the wall.\n\nHe need not necessarily be downright unscrupulous, but if he wishes to\nprofit he must not be overburdened with niceties in the point of honour.\nThat is where Richard Melvyn fell through. He was crippled with too many\nUtopian ideas of honesty, and was too soft ever to come off anything but\nsecond-best in a deal. He might as well have attempted to make his\nfortune by scraping a fiddle up and down Auburn Street, Goulburn. His\ndealing career was short and merry. His vanity to be considered a\nsocialistic fellow, who was as ready to take a glass with a swaggie as a\nswell, and the lavish shouting which this principle incurred, made great\ninroads on his means. Losing money every time he sold a beast, wasting\nstamps galore on letters to endless auctioneers, frequently remaining in\ntown half a week at a stretch, and being hail-fellow to all the spongers\nto be found on the trail of such as he, quickly left him on the verge of\nbankruptcy. Some of his contemporaries say it was grog that did it all.\n\nHad he kept clear-headed he was a smart fellow, and gave promise of\ndoing well, but his head would not stand alcohol, and by it he was\nundermined in no time. In considerably less than a twelvemonth all the\nspare capital in his coffers from the disposal of Bruggabrong and the\nBin Bins had been squandered. He had become so hard up that to pay the\ndrovers in his last venture he was forced to sell the calves of the few\nmilch-cows retained for household uses.\n\nAt this time it came to my father's knowledge that one of our bishops\nhad money held in trust for the Church. On good security he was giving\nthis out for usury, the same as condemned in the big Bible, out of which\nhe took the text of the dry-hash sermons with which he bored his\nfashionable congregations in his cathedral on Sundays.\n\nFather took advantage of this Reverend's inconsistency and mortgaged\nPossum Gully. With the money thus obtained he started once more and\nmanaged to make a scant livelihood and pay the interest on the bishop's\nloan. In four or five years he had again reached loggerheads. The price\nof stock had fallen so that there was nothing to be made out of dealing\nin them.\n\nRichard Melvyn resolved to live as those around him--start a dairy; run\nit with his family, who would also rear poultry for sale.\n\nAs instruments of the dairying trade he procured fifty milch-cows, the\ncalves of which had to be \"poddied\", and a hand cream-separator.\n\nI was in my fifteenth year when we began dairying; the twins Horace and\nGertie were, as you already know, eleven months younger. Horace, had\nthere been any one to train him, contained the makings of a splendid\nman; but having no one to bring him up in the way he should go, he was a\nchurlish and trying bully, and the issue of his character doubtful.\n\nGertie milked thirteen cows, and I eighteen, morning and evening. Horace\nand mother, between them, milked the remaining seventeen.\n\nAmong the dairying fraternity little toddlers, ere they are big enough\nto hold a bucket, learn to milk. Thus their hands become inured to the\nmotion, and it does not affect them. With us it was different. Being\nalmost full grown when we started to milk, and then plunging heavily\ninto the exercise, it had a painful effect upon us. Our hands and arms,\nas far as the elbows, swelled, so that our sleep at night was often\ndisturbed by pain.\n\nMother made the butter. She had to rise at two and three o'clock in the\nmorning, in order that it would be cool and firm enough to print for\nmarket.\n\nJane Haizelip had left us a year previously, and we could afford no one\nto take her place. The heavy work told upon my gentle, refined mother.\nShe grew thin and careworn, and often cross. My father's share of the\nwork was to break in the wild cows, separate the milk, and take the\nbutter into town to the grocer's establishment where we obtained our\nsupplies.\n\nDick Melvyn of Bruggabrong was not recognizable in Dick Melvyn, dairy\nfarmer and cocky of Possum Gully. The former had been a man worthy of\nthe name. The latter was a slave of drink, careless, even dirty and\nbedraggled in his personal appearance. He disregarded all manners, and\nhad become far more plebeian and common than the most miserable specimen\nof humanity around him. The support of his family, yet not, its support.\nThe head of his family, yet failing to fulfil the obligations demanded\nof one in that capacity. He seemed to lose all love and interest in his\nfamily, and grew cross and silent, utterly without pride and pluck.\nFormerly so kind and gentle with animals, now he was the reverse.\n\nHis cruelty to the young cows and want of patience with them I can never\nforget. It has often brought upon me the threat of immediate\nextermination for volunteering scathing and undesired opinions on his\nconduct.\n\nThe part of the dairying that he positively gloried in was going to town\nwith the butter. He frequently remained in for two or three days, as\noften as not spending all the money he got for the butter in a drunken\nspree. Then he would return to curse his luck because his dairy did not\npay as well as those of some of our neighbours.\n\nThe curse of Eve being upon my poor mother in those days, she was unable\nto follow her husband. Pride forbade her appealing to her neighbours, so\non me devolved the duty of tracking my father from one pub to another\nand bringing him home.\n\nHad I done justice to my mother's training I would have honoured my\npaternal parent in spite of all this, but I am an individual ever doing\nthings I oughtn't at the time I shouldn't.\n\nComing home, often after midnight, with my drunken father talking\nmaudlin conceited nonsense beside me, I developed curious ideas on the\nfifth commandment. Those journeys in the spring-cart through the soft\nfaint starlight were conducive to thought. My father, like most men when\nunder the influence of liquor, would allow no one but himself to handle\nthe reins, and he was often so incapable that he would keep turning the\nhorse round and round in the one place. It is a marvel we never met with\nan accident. I was not nervous, but quite content to take whatever came,\nand our trusty old horse fulfilled his duty, ever faithfully taking us\nhome along the gum-tree-lined road.\n\nMy mother had taught me from the Bible that I should honour my parents,\nwhether they were deserving of honour or not.\n\nDick Melvyn being my father did not blind me to the fact that he was a\ndespicable, selfish, weak creature, and as such I despised him with the\nrelentlessness of fifteen, which makes no allowance for human frailty\nand weakness. Disgust, not honour, was the feeling which possessed me\nwhen I studied the matter.\n\nTowards mother I felt differently. A woman is but the helpless tool of\nman--a creature of circumstances.\n\nSeeing my father beside me, and thinking of his infant with its mother,\neating her heart out with anxiety at home, this was the reasoning which\ntook possession of me. Among other such inexpressible thoughts I got\nlost, grew dizzy, and drew back appalled at the spirit which was\nmaturing within me. It was a grim lonely one, which I vainly tried to\nhide in a bosom which was not big or strong enough for its comfortable\nhabitation. It was as a climbing plant without a pole--it groped about\nthe ground, bruised itself, and became hungry searching for something\nstrong to which to cling. Needing a master-hand to train and prune, it\nwas becoming rank and sour.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER FIVE\n\nDisjointed Sketches And Grumbles\n\n\nIt was my duty to \"rare the poddies\". This is the most godless\noccupation in which it has been my lot to engage. I did a great amount\nof thinking while feeding them--for, by the way, I am afflicted with the\npower of thought, which is a heavy curse. The less a person thinks and\ninquires regarding the why and the wherefore and the justice of things,\nwhen dragging along through life, the happier it is for him, and doubly,\ntrebly so, for her.\n\nPoor little calves! Slaves to the greed of man! Bereft of the mothers\nwith which Nature has provided them, and compelled to exist on milk from\nthe separator, often thick, sour, and icy cold.\n\nBesides the milking I did, before I went to school every morning, for\nwhich I had to prepare myself and the younger children, and to which we\nhad to walk two miles. I had to feed thirty calves and wash the\nbreakfast dishes. On returning from school in the afternoon, often in a\nstate of exhaustion from walking in the blazing sun, I had the same\nduties over again, and in addition boots to clean and home lessons to\nprepare for the morrow. I had to relinquish my piano practice for want\nof time.\n\nAh, those short, short nights of rest and long, long days of toil! It\nseems to me that dairying means slavery in the hands of poor people who\ncannot afford hired labour. I am not writing of dairy-farming, the\ngenteel and artistic profession as eulogized in leading articles of\nagricultural newspapers and as taught in agricultural colleges. I am\ndepicting practical dairying as I have lived it, and seen it lived, by\ndozens of families around me.\n\nIt takes a great deal of work to produce even one pound of butter fit\nfor market. At the time I mention it was 3d. and 4d. per lb., so it was\nmuch work and small pay. It was slaving and delving from morning till\nnight--Sundays, week-days, and holidays, all alike were work-days to us.\n\nHard graft is a great leveller. Household drudgery, woodcutting,\nmilking, and gardening soon roughen the hands and dim the outside\npolish. When the body is wearied with much toil the desire to cultivate\nthe mind, or the cultivation it has already received, is gradually wiped\nout. Thus it was with my parents. They had dropped from swelldom to\npeasantism. They were among and of the peasantry. None of their former\nacquaintances came within their circle now, for the iron ungodly hand of\nclass distinction has settled surely down upon Australian\nsociety--Australia's democracy is only a tradition of the past.\n\nI say naught against the lower life. The peasantry are the bulwarks of\nevery nation. The life of a peasant is, to a peasant who is a peasant\nwith a peasant's soul, when times are good and when seasons smile, a\ngrand life. It is honest, clean, and wholesome. But the life of a\npeasant to me is purgatory. Those around me worked from morning till\nnight and then enjoyed their well-earned sleep. They had but two states\nof existence--work and sleep.\n\nThere was a third part in me which cried out to be fed. I longed for the\narts. Music was a passion with me. I borrowed every book in the\nneighbourhood and stole hours from rest to read them. This told upon me\nand made my physical burdens harder for me than for other children of my\nyears around me. That third was the strongest part of me. In it I lived\na dream-life with writers, artists, and musicians. Hope, sweet, cruel,\ndelusive Hope, whispered in my ear that life was long with much by and\nby, and in that by and by my dream-life would be real. So on I went with\nthat gleaming lake in the distance beckoning me to come and sail on its\nsilver waters, and Inexperience, conceited, blind Inexperience, failing\nto show the impassable pit between it and me.\n\nTo return to the dairying.\n\nOld and young alike we earned our scant livelihood by the heavy sweat of\nour brows. Still, we _did_ gain an honest living. We were not ashamed to\nlook day in the face, and fought our way against all odds with the\nstubborn independence of our British ancestors. But when 1894 went out\nwithout rain, and '95, hot, dry, pitiless '95, succeeded it, there came\na time when it was impossible to make a living.\n\nThe scorching furnace-breath winds shrivelled every blade of grass, dust\nand the moan of starving stock filled the air, vegetables became a thing\nof the past. The calves I had reared died one by one, and the cows\nfollowed in their footsteps.\n\nI had left school then, and my mother and father and I spent the days in\nlifting our cows. When our strength proved inadequate, the help of\nneighbours had to be called in, and father would give his services in\nreturn. Only a few of our more well-to-do neighbours had been able to\nsend their stock away, or had any better place to which to transfer\nthem. The majority of them were in as tight a plight as ourselves. This\ncow-lifting became quite a trade, the whole day being spent in it and in\ndiscussing the bad prospect ahead if the drought continued.\n\nMany an extra line of care furrowed the brows of the disheartened\nbushmen then. Not only was their living taken from them by the drought,\nbut there is nothing more heartrending than to have poor beasts,\nespecially dairy cows, so familiar, valued, and loved, pleading for food\nday after day in their piteous dumb way when one has it not to give.\n\nWe shore ourselves of all but the bare necessaries of life, but even\nthey for a family of ten are considerable, and it was a mighty tussle to\nget both ends within cover of meeting. We felt the full force of the\nheavy hand of poverty--the most stinging kind of poverty too, that which\nstill holds up its head and keeps an outside appearance. Far more\ngrinding is this than the poverty inherited from generations which is\nnot ashamed of itself, and has not as an accompaniment the wounded pride\nand humiliation which attacked us.\n\nSome there are who argue that poverty does not mean unhappiness. Let\nthose try what it is to be destitute of even one companionable friend,\nwhat it means to be forced to exist in an alien sphere of society, what\nit is like to be unable to afford a stamp to write to a friend; let them\nlong as passionately as I have longed for reading and music, and be\nunable to procure it because of poverty; let poverty force them into\ndoing work against which every fibre of their being revolts, as it has\nforced me, and then see if their lives will be happy.\n\nMy school life had been dull and uneventful. The one incident of any\nnote had been the day that the teacher, better known as old Harris,\n\"stood up\" to the inspector. The latter was a precise, collar-and-cuffs\nsort of little man. He gave one the impression of having all his ideas\non the subjects he thought worthy of attention carefully culled and\npacked in his brain-pan, and neatly labelled, so that he might without\nfluster pounce upon any of them at a moment's warning. He was\ngentlemanly and respectable, and discharged his duties punctiliously in\na manner reflecting credit on himself and his position, but, comparing\nthe mind of a philanthropist to the Murrumbidgee in breadth, his, in\ncomparison, might be likened to the flow of a bucket of water in a\ndray-rut.\n\nOn the day in question--a precious hot one it was--he had finished\nexamining us in most subjects, and was looking at our copy-books. He\nlooked up from them, ahemed! and fastidiously straightened his\nwaistcoat.\n\n\"Mr Harris!\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"Comparisons are odious, but, unfortunately, I am forced to draw one\nnow.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"This writing is much inferior to that of town scholars. It is very\nshaky and irregular. Also, I notice that the children seem stupid and\ndull. I don't like putting it so plainly, but, in fact, ah, they seem to\nbe possessed with the proverbial stupidity of country people. How do you\naccount for this?\"\n\nPoor old Harris! In spite of his drunken habits and inability to\nproperly discharge his duties, he had a warm heart and much fellowshiply\nhumanity in him. He understood and loved his pupils, and would not have\naspersions cast upon them. Besides, the nip he had taken to brace\nhimself to meet the inspector had been two or three, and they robbed him\nof the discretion which otherwise might have kept him silent.\n\n\"Si-r-r-r, I can and will account for it. Look you at every one of those\nchildren. Every one, right down to this little tot,\" indicating a little\ngirl of five, \"has to milk and work hard before and after school,\nbesides walk on an average two miles to and from school in this infernal\nheat. Most of the elder boys and girls milk on an average fourteen cows\nmorning and evening. You try that treatment for a week or two, my fine\ngentleman, and then see if your fist doesn't ache and shake so that you\ncan't write at all. See if you won't look a trifle dozy. Stupidity of\ncountry people be hanged! If you had to work from morning till night in\nthe heat and dust, and get precious little for it too, I bet you\nwouldn't have much time to scrape your finger-nails, read science notes,\nand look smart.\" Here he took off his coat and shaped up to his\nsuperior.\n\nThe inspector drew back in consternation.\n\n\"Mr Harris, you forget yourself!\"\n\nAt this juncture they went outside together. What happened there we\nnever knew. That is all we heard of the matter except the numerous\ngarbled accounts which were carried home that afternoon.\n\n\nA DROUGHT IDYLL\n\n\"Sybylla, what are you doing? Where is your mother?\"\n\n\"I'm ironing. Mother's down at the fowl-house seeing after some\nchickens. What do you want?\"\n\nIt was my father who addressed me. Time, 2 o'clock p.m. Thermometer hung\nin the shade of the veranda registering 105 1\/2 degrees.\n\n\"I see Blackshaw coming across the flat. Call your mother. You bring the\nleg-ropes--I've got the dog-leg. Come at once; we'll give the cows\nanother lift. Poor devils--might as well knock 'em on the head at once,\nbut there might be rain next moon. This drought can't last for ever.\"\n\nI called mother, got the leg-ropes, and set off, pulling my sun-bonnet\nclosely over my face to protect my eyes from the dust which was driving\nfrom the west in blinding clouds. The dog-leg to which father had\nreferred was three poles about eight or ten feet long, strapped together\nso they could be stood up. It was an arrangement father had devised to\nfacilitate our labour in lifting the cows. A fourth and longer pole was\nplaced across the fork formed by the three, and to one end of this were\ntied a couple of leg-ropes, after being placed round the beast, one\nbeneath the flank and one around the girth. On the other end of this\npole we would put our weight while one man would lift with the tail and\nanother with the horns. New-chum cows would sulk, and we would have\ngreat work with them; but those used to the performance would help\nthemselves, and up they'd go as nice as a daisy. The only art needed was\nto draw the pole back quickly before the cows could move, or the\nleg-ropes would pull them over again.\n\nOn this afternoon we had six cows to lift. We struggled manfully, and\ngot five on their feet, and then proceeded to where the last one was\nlying, back downwards, on a shadeless stony spot on the side of a hill.\nThe men slewed her round by the tail, while mother and I fixed the\ndog-leg and adjusted the ropes. We got the cow up, but the poor beast\nwas so weak and knocked about that she immediately fell down again. We\nresolved to let her have a few minutes' spell before making another\nattempt at lifting. There was not a blade of grass to be seen, and the\nground was too dusty to sit on. We were too overdone to make more than\none-worded utterances, so waited silently in the blazing sun, closing\nour eyes against the dust.\n\nWeariness! Weariness!\n\nA few light wind-smitten clouds made wan streaks across the white sky,\nhaggard with the fierce relentless glare of the afternoon sun. Weariness\nwas written across my mother's delicate careworn features, and found\nexpression in my father's knitted brows and dusty face. Blackshaw was\nweary, and said so, as he wiped the dust, made mud with perspiration,\noff his cheeks. I was weary--my limbs ached with the heat and work. The\npoor beast stretched at our feet was weary. All nature was weary, and\nseemed to sing a dirge to that effect in the furnace-breath wind which\nroared among the trees on the low ranges at our back and smote the\nparched and thirsty ground. All were weary, all but the sun. He seemed\nto glory in his power, relentless and untiring, as he swung boldly in\nthe sky, triumphantly leering down upon his helpless victims.\n\nWeariness! Weariness!\n\nThis was life--my life--my career, my brilliant career! I was\nfifteen--fifteen! A few fleeting hours and I would be old as those\naround me. I looked at them as they stood there, weary, and turning down\nthe other side of the hill of life. When young, no doubt they had hoped\nfor, and dreamed of, better things--had even known them. But here they\nwere. This had been their life; this was their career. It was, and in\nall probability would be, mine too. My life--my career--my brilliant\ncareer!\n\nWeariness! Weariness!\n\nThe summer sun danced on. Summer is fiendish, and life is a curse, I\nsaid in my heart. What a great dull hard rock the world was! On it were\na few barren narrow ledges, and on these, by exerting ourselves so that\nthe force wears off our finger-nails, it allows us to hang for a year or\ntwo, and then hurls us off into outer darkness and oblivion, perhaps to\nendure worse torture than this.\n\nThe poor beast moaned. The lifting had strained her, and there were\npatches of hide worn off her the size of breakfast-plates, sore and most\nharrowing to look upon.\n\nIt takes great suffering to wring a moan from the patience of a cow. I\nturned my head away, and with the impatience and one-sided reasoning\ncommon to fifteen, asked God what He meant by this. It is well enough to\nheap suffering on human beings, seeing it is supposed to be merely a\nprobation for a better world, but animals--poor, innocent animals--why\nare they tortured so?\n\n\"Come now, we'll lift her once more,\" said my father. At it we went\nagain; it is surprising what weight there is in the poorest cow. With\ngreat struggling we got her to her feet once more, and were careful this\ntime to hold her till she got steady on her legs. Father and mother at\nthe tail and Blackshaw and I at the horns, we marched her home and gave\nher a bran mash. Then we turned to our work in the house while the men\nsat and smoked and spat on the veranda, discussing the drought for an\nhour, at the end of which time they went to help someone else with their\nstock. I made up the fire and we continued our ironing, which had been\ninterrupted some hours before. It was hot unpleasant work on such a day.\nWe were forced to keep the doors and windows closed on account of the\nwind and dust. We were hot and tired, and our feet ached so that we\ncould scarcely stand on them.\n\nWeariness! Weariness!\n\nSummer is fiendish and life is a curse, I said in my heart.\n\nDay after day the drought continued. Now and again there would be a few\ndays of the raging wind before mentioned, which carried the dry grass\noff the paddocks and piled it against the fences, darkened the air with\ndust, and seemed to promise rain, but ever it dispersed whence it came,\ntaking with it the few clouds it had gathered up; and for weeks and\nweeks at a stretch, from horizon to horizon, was never a speck to mar\nthe cruel dazzling brilliance of the metal sky.\n\nWeariness! Weariness!\n\nI said the one thing many times but, ah, it was a weary thing which took\nmuch repetition that familiarity might wear away a little of its\nbitterness!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER SIX\n\nRevolt\n\n\nIn spite of our pottering and lifting, with the exception of five, all\nour cows eventually died; and even these and a couple of horses had as\nmuch as they could do to live on the whole of the thousand acres which,\nwithout reserve, were at their disposal. They had hardly any grass--it\nwas merely the warmth and water which kept them alive. Needless to say,\nwe were on our beam-ends financially. However, with a little help from\nmore fortunate relatives, and with the money obtained from the sale of\nthe cowhides and mother's poultry, we managed to pay the interest on the\nmoney borrowed from the bishop, and keep bread in our mouths.\n\nUnfortunately for us, at this time the bishop's agent proved a scoundrel\nand absconded. My father held receipts to show that to this agent he had\nregularly paid the interest of the money borrowed; but through some\nfinicking point of law, because we had not money to contend with him,\nhis lordship the bishop now refused to acknowledge his agent and\none-time pillar of the cathedral, and, having law on his side, served a\nwrit on us. In the face of our misfortunes this was too much: we begged\nfor time, which plea he answered by putting in the bailiff and selling\neverything we possessed. Our five cows, two horses, our milk separator,\nplough, cart, dray, buggy, even our cooking utensils, books, pictures,\nfurniture, father's watch--our very beds, pillows, and blankets. Not a\nthing besides what we stood up in was left us, and this was money for\nthe payment of which my father held receipts.\n\nBut for the generosity of our relatives we would have been in a pretty\nplight. They sent us sufficient means to buy in everything, and our\nneighbours came to our rescue with enthusiasm and warm-hearted genuine\nsympathy. The bailiff--a gentleman to the core--seeing how matters\nstood, helped us to the utmost of his power.\n\nOur goods were disposed of on the premises, and the neighbours arranged\na mock sale, at which the bailiff winked. Our friends had sent the\nmoney, and the neighbours did the bidding--none bidding against each\nother--and thus our belongings went for a mere trifle. Every cloud has\nits silver lining, and the black cloud of poverty has a very bright\nsilver lining.\n\nIn poverty you can get at the real heart of people as you can never do\nif rich. People are your friends from pure friendship and love, not from\nsponging self-interestedness. It is worth being poor once or twice in a\nlifetime just to experience the blessing and heartrestfulness of a\nlittle genuine reality in the way of love and friendship. Not that it is\nimpossible for opulence to have genuine friends, but rich people, I\nfear, must ever have at their heart cankering suspicion to hint that the\nfriendship and love lavished upon them is merely self-interestedness and\nsham, the implements of trade used by the fawning toadies who swarm\naround wealth.\n\nIn conjunction with the bishop's name, the approaching sale of our goods\nhad been duly advertised in the local papers, and my father received\nseveral letters of sympathy from the clergy deploring the conduct of the\nbishop. These letters were from men unknown to father, who were unaware\nthat Richard Melvyn was being sold off for a debt already paid.\n\nBy the generosity of relatives and the goodness of neighbours as kind as\never breathed, our furniture was our own again, but what were we to do\nfor a living? Our crops were withering in the fields for want of rain,\nand we had but five cows--not an over-bright outlook. As I was getting\nto bed one night my mother came into my room and said seriously,\n\"Sybylla, I want to have a talk with you.\"\n\n\"Talk away,\" I responded rather sullenly, for I expected a long\nsing-song about my good-for-nothingness in general--a subject of which I\nwas heartily tired.\n\n\"Sybylla, I've been studying the matter over a lot lately. It's no use,\nwe cannot afford to keep you at home. You'll have to get something to\ndo.\"\n\nI made no reply, and my mother continued, \"I am afraid we will have to\nbreak up the home altogether. It's no use; your father has no idea of\nmaking a living. I regret the day I ever saw him. Since he has taken to\ndrink he has no more idea of how to make a living than a cat. I will\nhave to give the little ones to some of the relatives; the bigger ones\nwill have to go out to service, and so will your father and I. That's\nall I can see ahead of us. Poor little Gertie is too young to go out in\nthe world (she was not twelve months younger than I); she must go to\nyour grandmother, I think.\"\n\nI still made no reply, so my mother inquired, \"Well, Sybylla, what do\nyou think of the matter?\"\n\n\"Do you think it absolutely necessary to break up the home?\" I said.\n\n\"Well, you suggest something better if you are so clever,\" said mother,\ncrossly. \"That is always the way; if I suggest a thing it is immediately\nput down, yet there is never any one to think of things but me. What\nwould you do? I suppose you think you could make a living on the place\nfor us yourself.\"\n\n\"Why can't we live at home? Blackshaw and Jansen have no bigger places\nthan we, and families just as large, and yet they make a living. It\nwould be terrible for the little ones to grow up separated; they would\nbe no more to each other than strangers.\"\n\n\"Yes; it is all very well for you to talk like that, but how is your\nfather to start again with only five cows in the world? It's no use, you\nnever talk sense. You'll find my way is always the best in the end.\"\n\n\"Would it not be easier,\" I replied, \"for our relations to each give a\nlittle towards setting us up again, than to be burdened with the whole\nresponsibility of rearing a child? I'm sure they'd much prefer it.\"\n\n\"Yes, perhaps it would be better, but I think _you_ will have to get\nyour own living. What would they say about having to support such a big\ngirl as you are?\"\n\n\"I will go and earn my own living, and when you get me weeded out of the\nfamily you will have a perfect paradise. Having no evil to copy, the\nchildren will grow up saints,\" I said bitterly.\n\n\"Now, Sybylla, it is foolish to talk like that, for you know that you\ntake no interest in your work. If you'd turn to and help me rear poultry\nand make dresses--and why don't you take to cooking?\"\n\n\"Take to cooking!\" I retorted with scorn. \"The fire that a fellow has to\nendure on that old oven would kill a horse, and the grit and dirt of\nclearing it up grinds on my very nerves. Besides, if I ever do want to\ndo any extra fancy cooking, we either can't afford the butter or the\ncurrants, or else the eggs are too scarce! Cook, be grannied!\"\n\n\"Sybylla! Sybylla, you are getting very vulgar!\"\n\n\"Yes, I once was foolish enough to try and be polite, but I've given it\nup. My style of talk is quite good enough for my company. What on earth\ndoes it matter whether I'm vulgar or not. I can feed calves and milk and\ngrind out my days here just as well vulgar as unvulgar,\" I answered\nsavagely.\n\n\"There, you see you are always discontented about your home. It's no\nuse; the only thing is for you to earn your own living.\"\n\n\"I will earn my own living.\"\n\n\"What will you do? Will you be examined for a pupil-teacher? That is a\nvery nice occupation for girls.\"\n\n\"What chance would I have in a competitive exam. against Goulburn girls?\nThey all have good teachers and give up their time to study. I only have\nold Harris, and he is the most idiotic old animal alive; besides, I\nloathe the very thought of teaching. I'd as soon go on the wallaby.\"\n\n\"You are not old enough to be a general servant or a cook; you have not\nexperience enough to be a housemaid; you don't take to sewing, and there\nis no chance of being accepted as a hospital nurse: you must confess\nthere is nothing you can do. You are really a very useless girl for your\nage.\"\n\n\"There are heaps of things I could do.\"\n\n\"Tell me a few of them.\"\n\nI was silent. The professions at which I felt I had the latent power to\nexcel, were I but given a chance, were in a sphere far above us, and to\nmention my feelings and ambitions to my matter-of-fact practical mother\nwould bring upon me worse ridicule than I was already forced to endure\nday by day.\n\n\"Mention a few of the things you could do.\"\n\nI might as well have named flying as the professions I was thinking of.\nMusic was the least unmentionable of them, so I brought it forward.\n\n\"Music! But it would take years of training and great expense before you\ncould earn anything at that! It is quite out of the question. The only\nthing for you to do is to settle down and take interest in your work,\nand help make a living at home, or else go out as a nurse-girl, and work\nyour way up. If you have any ability in you it would soon show. If you\nthink you could do such strokes, and the home work is not good enough\nfor you, go out and show the world what a wonderful creature you are.\"\n\n\"Mother, you are unjust and cruel!\" I exclaimed. \"You do not understand\none at all. I never thought I could do strokes. I cannot help being\nconstituted so that grimy manual labour is hateful to me, for it is\nhateful to me, and I hate it more and more every day, and you can preach\nand preach till you go black in the face, and still I'll hate it more\nthan ever. If I have to do it all my life, and if I'm cursed with a long\nlife, I'll hate it just as much at the end as I do now. I'm sure it's\nnot any wish of mine that I'm born with inclinations for better things.\nIf I could be born again, and had the designing of myself, I'd be born\nthe lowest and coarsest-minded person imaginable, so that I could find\nplenty of companionship, or I'd be born an idiot, which would be better\nstill.\"\n\n\"Sybylla!\" said my mother in a shocked tone. \"It is a wonder God doesn't\nstrike you dead; I never heard--\"\n\n\"I don't believe there is a God,\" I said fiercely, \"and if there is,\nHe's not the merciful being He's always depicted, or He wouldn't be\nalways torturing me for His own amusement.\"\n\n\"Sybylla, Sybylla! That I should ever have nurtured a child to grow up\nlike this! Do you know that--\"\n\n\"I only know that I hate this life. I hate it, I hate it, I hate it,\" I\nsaid vehemently.\n\n\"Talk about going out to earn your own living! Why, there's not a woman\nliving would have you in her house above a day. You are a perfect\nshe-devil. Oh God!\" And my mother began to cry. \"What have I done to be\ncursed with such a child? There is not another woman in the district\nwith such a burden put upon her. What have I done? I can only trust that\nmy prayers to God for you will soften your evil heart.\"\n\n\"If your prayers are answered, it's more than ever mine were,\" I\nretorted.\n\n\"_Your_ prayers!\" said my mother, with scorn. \"The horror of a child not\nyet sixteen being so hardened. I don't know what to make of you, you\nnever cry or ask forgiveness. There's dear little Gertie now, she is\noften naughty, but when I correct her she frets and worries and shows\nherself to be a human being and not a fiend.\"\n\nSo saying my mother went out of the room.\n\n\"I've asked forgiveness once too often, to be sat upon for my pains,\" I\ncalled out.\n\n\"I believe you're mad. That is the only feasible excuse I can make for\nyour conduct,\" she said as a parting shot.\n\n\"Why the deuce don't you two get to bed and not wrangle like a pair of\ncats in the middle of the night, disturbing a man's rest?\" came in my\nfather's voice from amid the bedclothes.\n\nMy mother is a good woman--a very good woman--and I am, I think, not\nquite all criminality, but we do not pull together. I am a piece of\nmachinery which, not understanding, my mother winds up the wrong way,\nsetting all the wheels of my composition going in creaking discord.\n\nShe wondered why I did not cry and beg forgiveness, and thereby give\nevidence of being human. I was too wrought up for tears. Ah, that tears\nmight have come to relieve my overburdened heart! I took up the\nhome-made tallow candle in its tin stick and looked at my pretty\nsleeping sister Gertie (she and I shared the one bed). It was as mother\nhad said. If Gertie was scolded for any of her shortcomings, she\nimmediately took refuge in tears, said she was sorry, obtained\nforgiveness, and straightaway forgot the whole matter. She came within\nthe range of mother's understanding, I did not; she had feelings, mother\nthought, I had none. Did my mother understand me, she would know that I\nam capable of more depths of agony and more exquisite heights of joy in\none day than Gertie will experience in her whole life.\n\nWas I mad as mother had said? A fear took possession of me that I might\nbe. I certainly was utterly different to any girl I had seen or known.\nWhat was the hot wild spirit which surged within me? Ah, that I might\nweep! I threw myself on my bed and moaned. Why was I not like other\ngirls? Why was I not like Gertie? Why were not a new dress, everyday\nwork, and an occasional picnic sufficient to fill my mind? My movements\nawakened Gertie.\n\n\"What is the matter, dear Sybylla? Come to bed. Mother has been scolding\nyou. She is always scolding some one. That doesn't matter. You say you\nare sorry, and she won't scold any more. That's what I always do. Do get\ninto bed. You'll be tired in the morning.\"\n\n\"What does it matter if I will be. I wish I would be dead. What's the\ngood of a hateful thing like I am being alive. No one wants or cares for\nme.\"\n\n\"I love you, Sybylla, better than all the rest. I could not do without\nyou,\" and she put her pretty face to mine and kissed me.\n\nWhat a balm to the tempest-tossed soul is a little love, though it may\nbe fleeting and fickle! I was able to weep now, with wild hot tears, and\nwith my sister's arms around me I fell asleep without undressing\nfurther.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER SEVEN\n\nWas E'er a Rose Without Its Thorn?\n\n\nI arose from bed next morning with three things in my head--a pair of\nswollen eyes, a heavy pain, and a fixed determination to write a book.\nNothing less than a book. A few hours' work in the keen air of a late\nautumn morning removed the swelling from my eyes and the pain from my\ntemples, but the idea of relieving my feelings in writing had taken firm\nroot in my brain. It was not my first attempt in this direction. Two\nyears previously I had purloined paper and sneaked out of bed every\nnight at one or two o'clock to write a prodigious novel in point of\nlength and detail, in which a full-fledged hero and heroine performed\nthe duties of a hero and heroine in the orthodox manner. Knowing our\ncircumstances, my grandmother was accustomed, when writing to me, to\nenclose a stamp to enable me to reply. These I saved, and with them sent\nmy book to the leading Sydney publisher. After waiting many weeks I\nreceived a polite memo to the effect that the story showed great\nability, but the writer's inexperience was too much in evidence for\npublication. The writer was to study the best works of literature, and\nwould one day, no doubt, take a place among Australian novelists.\n\nThis was a very promising opinion of the work of a child of thirteen,\nmore encouraging than the great writers got at the start of their\nliterary career; but it seemed to even my childish intelligence that the\nmemo was a stereotyped affair that the publisher sent in answer to all\nthe MSS. of fameless writers submitted to him, and also sent in all\nprobability without reading as much as the name of the story. After that\nI wrote a few short stories and essays; but now the spirit moved me to\nwrite another book--not with any hope of success, as it was impossible\nfor me to study literature as advised. I seldom saw a book, and could\nonly spare time in tiny scraps to read them when I did.\n\nHowever, the few shillings I had obtained at odd times I spent on paper,\nand in secret robbed from much-needed rest a few hours weekly wherein to\nwrite. This made me very weary and slow in the daytime, and a sore trial\nto my mother. I was always forgetting things I should not have\nforgotten, because my thoughts were engaged in working out my story. The\nwant of rest told upon me. I continually complained of weariness, and my\nwork was a drag to me.\n\nMy mother knew not what to make of it. At first she thought I was lazy\nand bad, and punished me in various ways; but while my book occupied my\nmind I was not cross, gave her no impudence, and did not flare up. Then\nshe began to fear I must be ill, and took me to a doctor, who said I was\nmuch too precocious for my years, and would be better when the weather\ngot warmer. He gave me a tonic, which I threw out the window. I heard no\nmore of going out as nurse-girl: father had joined a neighbour who had\ntaken a road contract, and by this means the pot was kept, if not quite,\nat least pretty near, boiling.\n\nLife jogged along tamely, and, as far as I could see, gave promise of\ngoing to the last slip-rails without a canter, until one day in July\n1896 mother received a letter from her mother which made a pleasant\nchange in my life, though, like all sweets, that letter had its bitter\ndrop. It ran as follows:--\n\n\nMy dear daughter, Lucy,\n\nOnly a short letter this time. I am pressed for time, as four or five\nstrangers have just come and asked to stay for the night, and as one of\nthe girls is away, I have to get them beds. I am writing about Sybylla.\nI am truly grieved to hear she is such a source of grief and annoyance\nto you. The girl must surely be ill or she would never act as you\ndescribe. She is young yet, and may settle down better by and by. We can\nonly entrust her to the good God who is ever near. Send her up to me as\nsoon as you can. I will pay all expenses. The change will do her good,\nand if her conduct improves, I will keep her as long as you like. She is\nyoung to mention in regard to marriage, but in another year she will be\nas old as I was when I married, and it might be the makings of her if\nshe married early. At any rate she will be better away from Possum\nGully, now that she is growing into womanhood, or she may be in danger\nof forming ties beneath her. She might do something good for herself up\nhere: not that I would ever be a matchmaker in the least degree, but\nGertie will soon be coming on, and Sybylla, being so very plain, will\nneed all the time she can get.\n\nYour loving mother,\n\nL. Bossier.\n\n\nMy mother gave me this letter to read, and, when I had finished perusing\nit, asked me would I go. I replied coldly:\n\n\"Yes. Paupers and beggars cannot be choosers, and grandmother might as\nwell keep me at Caddagat as at Possum Gully\"--for my grandmother\ncontributed greatly to the support of our family.\n\nAs regards scenery, the one bit of beauty Possum Gully possessed was its\nwattles. Bowers of grown and scrubs of young ones adorned the hills and\ngullies in close proximity to the house, while groves of different\nspecies graced the flats. Being Sunday, on this afternoon I was at\nliberty for a few hours; and on receiving the intelligence contained in\nthe letter, I walked out of the house over a low hill at the back into a\ngully, where I threw myself at the foot of a wattle in a favourite\nclump, and gave way to my thoughts.\n\nSo mother had been telling my grandmother of my faults--my grandmother\nwhom I loved so dearly. Mother might have had enough honour and motherly\nprotection to have kept the tale of my sins to herself. Though this\nintelligence angered, it did not surprise me, being accustomed to mother\ntelling every neighbour what a great trial I was to her--how\ndiscontented I was, and what little interest I took in my work. It was\nthe last part of the letter which finished up my feelings. Oh heavens!\nSurely if my mother understood the wild pain, the days and hours of\nagony pure and complete I have suffered on account of my appearance, she\nwould never have shown me that letter.\n\nI was to be given more time on account of being ugly--I was not a\nvaluable article in the marriage market, sweet thought! My grandmother\nis one of the good old school, who believed that a girl's only proper\nsphere in life was marriage; so, knowing her sentiments, her purpose to\nget me married neither surprised nor annoyed me. But I was plain. Ah,\nbosh! Oh! Ah! I cannot express what kind of a feeling that fact gave me.\nIt sank into my heart and cut like a cruel jagged knife--not because it\nwould be a drawback to me in the marriage line, for I had an antipathy\nto the very thought of marriage. Marriage to me appeared the most\nhorribly tied-down and unfair-to-women existence going. It would be from\nfair to middling if there was love; but I laughed at the idea of love,\nand determined never, never, never to marry.\n\nThe other side of the letter--the part which gave me joy--was the\nprospect of going to Caddagat.\n\nCaddagat, the place where I was born! Caddagat, whereat, enfolded in\ngrandmotherly love and the petting which accrued therefrom, I spent some\nof my few sweet childish days. Caddagat, the place my heart fondly\nenshrines as home. Caddagat, draped by nature in a dream of beauty.\nCaddagat, Caddagat! Caddagat for me, Caddagat for ever! I say.\n\nToo engrossed with my thoughts to feel the cold of the dull winter day,\nI remained in my position against the wattle-tree until Gertie came to\ninform me that tea was ready.\n\n\"You know, Sybylla, it was your turn to get the tea ready; but I set the\ntable to save you from getting into a row. Mother was looking for you,\nand said she supposed you were in one of your tantrums again.\"\n\nPretty little peacemaker! She often did things like that for me.\n\n\"Very well, Gertie, thank you. I will set it two evenings running to\nmake up for it--if I'm here.\"\n\n\"If you are here! What do you mean?\"\n\n\"I am going away,\" I replied, watching her narrowly to see if she cared,\nfor I was very hungry for love.\n\n\"Going to run away becauses mother is always scolding you?\"\n\n\"No, you little silly! I'm going up to Caddagat to live with grannie.\"\n\n\"Always?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Really?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Honour bright?\"\n\n\"Yes; really and truly and honour bright.\"\n\n\"Won't you ever come back again?\"\n\n\"I don't know about _never_ coming back again; but I'm going up for\nalways, as far as a person can lay out ahead of her. Do you care?\"\n\nYes she cared. The childish mouth quivered, the pretty blue-eyed face\nfell, the ready tears flowed fast. I noticed every detail with savage\ncomfort. It was more than I deserved, for, though I loved her\npassionately, I had ever been too much wrapped in self to have been very\nkind and lovable to her.\n\n\"Who will tell me stories now?\"\n\nIt was a habit of mine to relate stories to her out of my own fertile\nimagination. In return for this she kept secret the fact that I sat up\nand wrote when I should have been in bed. I was obliged to take some\nmeans of inducing her to keep silence, as she--even Gertie, who firmly\nbelieved in me--on waking once or twice at unearthly hours and\ndiscovering me in pursuit of my nightly task, had been so alarmed for my\nsanity that I had the greatest work to prevent her from yelling to\nfather and mother on the spot. But I bound her to secrecy, and took a\nstrange delight in bringing to her face with my stories the laughter,\nthe wide-eyed wonder, or the tears--just as my humour dictated.\n\n\"You'll easily get someone else to tell you stories.\"\n\n\"Not like yours. And who will take my part when Horace bullies me?\"\n\nI pressed her to me.\n\n\"Gertie, Gertie, promise me you will love me a little always, and never,\nnever forget me. Promise me.\"\n\nAnd with a weakly glint of winter sunshine turning her hair to gold, and\nwith her head on my shoulder, Gertie promised--promised with the soluble\npromise of a butterfly-natured child.\n\n\nSELF-ANALYSIS\n\nN.B.--This is dull and egotistical. Better skip it. That's my advice--S.\nP. M.\n\n\nAs a tiny child I was filled with dreams of the great things I was to do\nwhen grown up. My ambition was as boundless as the mighty bush in which\nI have always lived. As I grew it dawned upon me that I was a girl--the\nmakings of a woman! Only a girl--merely this and nothing more. It came\nhome to me as a great blow that it was only men who could take the world\nby its ears and conquer their fate, while women, metaphorically\nspeaking, were forced to sit with tied hands and patiently suffer as the\nwaves of fate tossed them hither and thither, battering and bruising\nwithout mercy. Familiarity made me used to this yoke; I recovered from\nthe disappointment of being a girl, and was reconciled to that part of\nmy fate. In fact, I found that being a girl was quite pleasant until a\nhideous truth dawned upon me--I was ugly! That truth has embittered my\nwhole existence. It gives me days and nights of agony. It is a sensitive\nsore that will never heal, a grim hobgoblin that nought can scare away.\nIn conjunction with this brand of hell I developed a reputation of\ncleverness. Worse and worse! Girls! girls! Those of you who have hearts,\nand therefore a wish for happiness, homes, and husbands by and by, never\ndevelop a reputation of being clever. It will put you out of the\nmatrimonial running as effectually as though it had been circulated that\nyou had leprosy. So, if you feel that you are afflicted with more than\nordinary intelligence, and especially if you are plain with it, hide\nyour brains, cramp your mind, study to appear unintellectual--it is your\nonly chance. Provided a woman is beautiful allowance will be made for\nall her shortcomings. She can be unchaste, vapid, untruthful, flippant,\nheartless, and even clever; so long as she is fair to see men will stand\nby her, and as men, in this world, are \"the dog on top\", they are the\npower to truckle to. A plain woman will have nothing forgiven her. Her\nfate is such that the parents of uncomely female infants should be\ncompelled to put them to death at their birth.\n\nThe next unpleasant discovery I made in regard to myself was that I was\nwoefully out of my sphere. I studied the girls of my age around me, and\ncompared myself with them. We had been reared side by side. They had had\nequal advantages; some, indeed, had had greater. We all moved in the one\nlittle, dull world, but they were not only in their world, they were of\nit; I was not. Their daily tasks and their little pleasures provided\nsufficient oil for the lamp of their existence--mine demanded more than\nPossum Gully could supply. They were totally ignorant of the outside\nworld. Patti, Melba, Irving, Terry, Kipling, Caine, Corelli, and even\nthe name of Gladstone, were only names to them. Whether they were\nislands or racehorses they knew not and cared not. With me it was\ndifferent. Where I obtained my information, unless it was born in me, I\ndo not know. We took none but the local paper regularly, I saw few\nbooks, had the pleasure of conversing with an educated person from the\nhigher walks of life about once in a twelvemonth, yet I knew of every\ncelebrity in literature, art, music, and drama; their world was my\nworld, and in fancy I lived with them. My parents discouraged me in that\nspecies of foolishness. They had been fond of literature and the higher\narts, but now, having no use for them, had lost interest therein.\n\nI was discontented and restless, and longed unendurably to be out in the\nstream of life. \"Action! Action! Give me action!\" was my cry. My mother\ndid her best with me according to her lights. She energetically preached\nat me. All the old saws and homilies were brought into requisition, but\nwithout avail. It was like using common nostrums on a disease which\ncould be treated by none but a special physician.\n\nI was treated to a great deal of harping on that tiresome old string,\n\"Whatsoever your hand findeth to do, do it with all your might.\" It was\ndaily dinned into my cars that the little things of life were the\nnoblest, and that all the great people I mooned about said the same. I\nusually retorted to the effect that I was well aware that it was noble,\nand that I could write as good an essay on it as any philosopher. It was\nall very well for great people to point out the greatness of the little,\nempty, humdrum life. Why didn't they adopt it themselves?\n\n    \"The toad beneath the harrow knows\n     Exactly where each tooth-point goes.\n     The butterfly upon the road\n     Preaches contentment to the toad.\"\n\nI wasn't anxious to patronize the dull kind of tame nobility of the\ntoad; I longed for a few of the triumphs of the butterfly, decried\nthough they are as hollow bubbles. I desired life while young enough to\nlive, and quoted as my motto:\n\n    \"Though the pitcher that goes to the sparkling rill\n     Too oft gets broken at last,\n     There are scores of others its place to fill\n     When its earth to the earth is cast.\n     Keep that pitcher at home, let it never roam,\n     But lie like a useless clod;\n     Yet sooner or later the hour will come\n     When its chips are thrown to the sod.\n\n    \"Is it wise, then, say, in the waning day,\n     When the vessel is crack'd and old,\n     To cherish the battered potter's clay\n     As though it were virgin gold?\n     Take care of yourself, dull, boorish elf,\n     Though prudent and sage you seem;\n     Your pitcher will break on the musty shelf,\n     And mine by the dazzling stream.\"\n\nI had sense sufficient to see the uselessness of attempting to be other\nthan I was. In these days of fierce competition there was no chance for\nme--opportunity, not talent, was the main requisite. Fate had thought\nfit to deny me even one advantage or opportunity, thus I was helpless. I\nset to work to cut my coat according to my cloth. I manfully endeavoured\nto squeeze my spirit into \"that state of life into which it has pleased\nGod to call me\". I crushed, compressed, and bruised, but as fast as I\nmanaged it on one side it burst out on another, and defied me to cram it\ninto the narrow box of Possum Gully.\n\n    \"The restless throbbings and burnings\n       That hope unsatisfied brings,\n     The weary longings and yearnings\n       For the mystical better things,\n     Are the sands on which is reflected\n       The pitiless moving lake,\n     Where the wanderer falls dejected,\n       By a thirst he never can slake.\"\n\nIn a vain endeavour to slake that cruel thirst my soul groped in strange\ndark places. It went out in quest of a God, and finding one not, grew\nweary.\n\nBy the unknown way that the atmosphere of the higher life penetrated to\nme, so came a knowledge of the sin and sorrow abroad in the world--the\ncry of the millions oppressed, downtrodden, God-forsaken! The wheels of\nsocial mechanism needed readjusting--things were awry. Oh, that I might\nfind a cure and give it to my fellows! I dizzied my brain with the\nproblem; I was too much for myself. A man with these notions is a curse\nto himself, but a woman--pity help a woman of that description! She is\nnot merely a creature out of her sphere, she is a creature without a\nsphere--a lonely being!\n\nRecognizing this, I turned and cursed God for casting upon me a burden\ngreater than I could bear--cursed Him bitterly, and from within came a\nwhisper that there was nothing there to curse. There was no God. I was\nan unbeliever. It was not that I sought after or desired atheism. I\nlonged to be a Christian, and fought against unbelief. I asked the\nChristians around me for help. Unsophisticated fool! I might as well\nhave announced that I was a harlot. My respectability vanished in one\nslap. Some said it was impossible to disbelieve in the existence of a\nGod: I was only doing it for notoriety, and they washed their hands of\nme at once.\n\nNot believe in God! I was mad!\n\nIf there really was a God, would they kindly tell me how to find Him?\n\nPray! pray!\n\nI prayed, often and ardently, but ever came that heart-stilling whisper\nthat there was nothing to pray to.\n\nAh, the bitter, hopeless heart-hunger of godlessness none but an atheist\ncan understand! Nothing to live for in life--no hope beyond the grave.\nIt plunged me into fits of profound melancholy.\n\nHad my father occupied one of the fat positions of the land, no doubt as\nhis daughter my life would have been so full of pleasant occupation and\npleasure that I would not have developed the spirit which torments me\nnow. Or had I a friend--one who knew, who had suffered and understood,\none in whom I could lose myself, one on whom I could lean--I might have\ngrown a nicer character. But in all the wide world there was not a soul\nto hold out a hand to me, and I said bitterly, \"There is no good in the\nworld.\" In softer moods I said, \"Ah, the tangle of it! Those who have\nthe heart to help have not the power, and those who have the power have\nnot the heart.\"\n\nBad, like a too-strong opponent in a game of chess, is ever at the elbow\nof good to checkmate it like a weakly managed king.\n\nI am sadly lacking in self-reliance. I needed some one to help me over\nthe rough spots in life, and finding them not, at the age of sixteen I\nwas as rank a cynic and infidel as could be found in three days' march.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER EIGHT\n\nPossum Gully Left Behind. Hurrah! Hurrah!\n\n\nIf a Sydney man has friends residing at Goulburn, he says they are up\nthe country. If a Goulburn man has friends at Yass, he says they are up\nthe country. If a Yass man has friends at Young, he says they are up the\ncountry, and so on. Caddagat is \"up the country\".\n\nBound thither on the second Wednesday in August 1896, I bought a ticket\nat the Goulburn railway station, and at some time about 1 a.m. took my\nseat in a second class carriage of the mail-train on its way to\nMelbourne. I had three or four hours to travel in this train when I\nwould have to change to a branch line for two hours longer. I was the\nonly one from Goulburn in that carriage; all the other passengers had\nbeen in some time and were asleep. One or two opened their eyes\nstrugglingly, stared glumly at the intruder, and then went to sleep\nagain. The motion of the train was a joy to me, and sleep never entered\nmy head. I stood up, and pressing my forehead to the cold window-pane,\nvainly attempted, through the inky blackness of the foggy night, to\ndiscern the objects which flew by.\n\nI was too full of pleasant anticipation of what was ahead of me to think\nof those I had left behind. I did not regret leaving Possum Gully. Quite\nthe reverse; I felt inclined to wave my arms and yell for joy at being\nfreed from it. Home! God forbid that my experiences at Possum Gully\nshould form the only food for my reminiscences of home. I had\npractically grown up there, but my heart refused absolutely to regard it\nas home. I hated it then, I hate it now, with its narrowing, stagnant\nmonotony. It has and had not provided me with one solitary fond\nremembrance--only with dreary, wing-clipping, mind-starving\nrecollections. No, no; I was not leaving home behind, I was flying\nhomeward now. Home, home to Caddagat, home to ferny gullies, to the\nsweet sad rush of many mountain waters, to the majesty of rugged\nBorgongs; home to dear old grannie, and uncle and aunt, to books, to\nmusic; refinement, company, pleasure, and the dear old homestead I love\nso well.\n\nAll in good time I arrived at the end of my train journey, and was taken\nin charge by a big red-bearded man, who informed me he was the driver of\nthe mail-coach, and had received a letter from Mrs Bossier instructing\nhim to take care of me. He informed me also that he was glad to do what\nhe termed \"that same\", and I would be as safe under his care as I would\nbe in God's pocket.\n\nMy twenty-six miles' coach drive was neither pleasant nor eventful. I\nwas the only passenger, and so had my choice of seats. The weather being\ncold and wet, I preferred being inside the box and curled myself up on\nthe seat, to be interrupted every two or three miles by the good-natured\ndriver inquiring if I was \"all serene\".\n\nAt the Halfway House, where a change of the team of five horses was\naffected, I had a meal and a warm, and so tuned myself up for the\nremainder of the way. It got colder as we went on, and at 2.30 p.m. I\nwas not at all sorry to see the iron roofs of Gool-Gool township\ndisclosing to my view. We first went to the post office, where the\nmail-bags were delivered, and then returned and pulled rein in front of\nthe Woolpack Hotel. A tall young gentleman in a mackintosh and cap, who\nhad been standing on the veranda, stepped out on the street as the coach\nstopped, and lifting his cap and thrusting his head into the coach,\ninquired, \"Which is Miss Melvyn?\"\n\nSeeing I was the only occupant, he laughed the pleasantest of laughs,\ndisclosing two wide rows of perfect teeth, and turning to the driver,\nsaid, \"Is that your only passenger? I suppose it is Miss Melvyn?\"\n\n\"As I wasn't present at her birth, I can't swear, but I believe her to\nbe that same, as sure as eggs is eggs,\" he replied.\n\nMy identity being thus established, the young gentleman with the\ngreatest of courtesy assisted me to alight, ordered the hotel groom to\nstow my luggage in the Caddagat buggy, and harness the horses with all\nexpedition. He then conducted me to the private parlour, where a\nfriendly little barmaid had some refreshments on a tray awaiting me, and\nwhile warming my feet preparatory to eating I read the letter he had\ngiven me, which was addressed in my grandmother's handwriting. In it she\ntold me that she and my aunt were only just recovering from bad colds,\nand on account of the inclemency of the weather thought it unwise to\ncome to town to meet me; but Frank Hawden, the jackeroo would take every\ncare of me, settle the hotel bill, and tip the coach-driver. Caddagat\nwas twenty-four miles distant from Gool-Gool, and the latter part of the\nroad was very hilly. It was already past three o'clock, and, being\nrainy, the short winter afternoon would dose in earlier; so I swallowed\nmy tea and cake with all expedition, so as not to delay Mr Hawden, who\nwas waiting to assist me into the buggy, where the groom was in charge\nof the horses in the yard. He struck up a conversation with me\nimmediately.\n\n\"Seeing your name on yer bags, an' knowin' you was belonging to the\nBossiers, I ask if yer might be a daughter of Dick Melvyn, of\nBruggabrong, out by Timlinbilly.\"\n\n\"Yes, I am.\"\n\n\"Well, miss, please remember me most kindly to yer pa; he was a good\nboss was Dick Melvyn. I hope he's doin' well. I'm Billy Haizelip,\nbrother to Mary and Jane. You remember Jane, I s'pose, miss?\"\n\nI hadn't time to say more than promise to send his remembrances to my\nfather, for Mr Hawden, saying we would be in the dark, had whipped his\nhorses and was bowling off at a great pace, in less than two minutes\ncovering a rise which put Gool-Gool out of sight. It was raining a\nlittle, so I held over us the big umbrella, which grannie had sent,\nwhile we discussed the weather, to the effect that rain was badly needed\nand was a great novelty nowadays, and it was to be hoped it would\ncontinue. There had been but little, but the soil here away was of that\nrich loamy description which little water turns to mud. It clogged the\nwheels and loaded the break-blocks; and the near side horse had a nasty\nway of throwing his front feet, so that he deposited soft red lumps of\nmud in our laps at every step. But, despite these trifling drawbacks, it\nwas delightful to be drawn without effort by a pair of fat horses in\nsplendid harness. It was a great contrast to our poor skinny old horse\nat home, crawling along in much-broken harness, clumsily and much mended\nwith string and bits of hide.\n\nMr Hawden was not at all averse to talking. After emptying our tongues\nof the weather, there was silence for some time, which he broke with,\n\"So you are Mrs Bossier's grand-daughter, are you?\"\n\n\"Not remembering my birth, I can't swear; but I believe myself to be\nthat same, as sure as eggs is eggs,\" I replied.\n\nHe laughed. \"Very good imitation of the coach-driver. But Mrs Bossier's\ngrand-daughter! Well, I should smile!\"\n\n\"What at?\"\n\n\"Your being Mrs Bossier's grand-daughter.\"\n\n\"I fear, Mr Hawden, there is a suspicion reverse of complimentary in\nyour remark.\"\n\n\"Well, I should smile! Would you like to have my opinion of you?\"\n\n\"Nothing would please me more. I would value your opinion above all\nthings, and I'm sure--I feel certain--that you have formed a true\nestimate of me.\"\n\nAt any other time his conceit would have brought upon himself a fine\nsnubbing, but today I was in high feather, and accordingly very\npleasant, and resolved to amuse myself by drawing him out.\n\n\"Well, you are not a bit like Mrs Bossier or Mrs Bell; they are both so\ngood-looking,\" he continued.\n\n\"Indeed!\"\n\n\"I was disappointed when I saw you had no pretensions to prettiness, as\nthere's not a girl up these parts worth wasting a man's affections on,\nand I was building great hopes on you. But I'm a great admirer of\nbeauty,\" he twaddled.\n\n\"I am very sorry for you, Mr Hawden. I'm sure it would take quite a\nparagon to be worthy of such affection as I'm sure yours would be,\" I\nreplied sympathetically.\n\n\"Never mind. Don't worry about it. You're not a bad sort, and think a\nfellow could have great fun with you.\"\n\n\"I'm sure, Mr Hawden, you do me too much honour. It quite exhilarates me\nto think that I meet with your approval in the smallest degree,\" I\nreplied with the utmost deference. \"You are so gentlemanly and nice that\nI was alarmed at first lest you might despise me altogether.\"\n\n\"No fear. You needn't be afraid of me; I'm not a bad sort of fellow,\" he\nreplied with the greatest encouragement.\n\nBy his accent and innocent style I detected he was not a colonial, so I\ngot him to relate his history. He was an Englishman by birth, but had\nbeen to America, Spain, New Zealand, Tasmania, etc.; by his own make out\nhad ever been a man of note, and had played Old Harry everywhere.\n\nI allowed him to gabble away full tilt for an hour on this subject,\nunconscious that I had taken the measure of him, and was grinning\nbroadly to myself. Then I diverted him by inquiring how long since the\nwire fence on our right had been put up. It bore evidence of recent\nerection, and had replaced an old cockatoo fence which I remembered in\nmy childhood.\n\n\"Fine fence, is it not? Eight wires, a top rail, and very stout posts.\nHarry Beecham had that put up by contract this year. Twelve miles of it.\nIt cost him a lot: couldn't get any very low tenders, the ground being\nso hard on account of the drought. Those trees are Five-Bob Downs--see,\naway over against the range. But I suppose you know the places better\nthan I do.\"\n\nWe were now within an hour of our destination. How familiar were many\nlandmarks to me, although I had not seen them since I was eight years\nold.\n\nA river ran on our right, occasionally a glimmer of its noisy waters\nvisible through the shrubbery which profusely lined its banks. The short\nevening was drawing to a close. The white mists brought by the rain were\ncrawling slowly down the hills, and settling in the hollows of the\nranges on our left. A V-shaped rift in them, known as Pheasant Gap, came\ninto view. Mr Hawden said it was well named, as it swarmed with\nlyrebirds. Night was falling. The skreel of a hundred curlews arose from\nthe gullies--how I love their lonely wail!--and it was quite dark when\nwe pulled up before the front gate of Caddagat.\n\nA score of dogs rushed yelping to meet us, the front door was thrown\nopen, lights and voices came streaming out.\n\nI alighted from the buggy feeling rather nervous. I was a pauper with a\nbad character. How would my grandmother receive me? Dear old soul, I had\nnothing to fear. She folded me in a great warm-hearted hug, saying,\n\"Dear me, child, your face is cold. I'm glad you've come. It has been a\nterrible day, but we're glad to have the rain. You must be frozen. Get\nin to the fire, child, as fast as you can. Get in to the fire, get in to\nthe fire. I hope you forgive me for not going to meet you.\" And there\nwas my mother's only sister, my tall graceful aunt, standing beside her,\ngiving me a kiss and cordial hand-clasp, and saying, \"Welcome, Sybylla.\nWe will be glad to have a young person to brighten up the old home once\nmore. I am sorry I was too unwell to meet you. You must be frozen; come\nto the fire.\"\n\n\nMy aunt always spoke very little and very quietly, but there was\nsomething in her high-bred style which went right home.\n\nI could scarcely believe that they were addressing me. Surely they were\nmaking a mistake. This reception was meant for some grand relative\nhonouring them with a visit, and not for the ugly, useless, bad little\npauper come to live upon their bounty.\n\nTheir welcome did more than all the sermons I had ever heard put\ntogether towards thawing a little of the pitiless cynicism which\nencrusted my heart.\n\n\"Take the child inside, Helen, as fast as you can,\" said grannie, \"while\nI see that the boy attends to the horses. The plaguey fellow can't be\ntrusted any further than the length of his nose. I told him to tie up\nthese dogs, and here they are yelp-yelping fit to deafen a person.\"\n\nI left my wet umbrella on the veranda, and aunt Helen led me into the\ndining-room, where a spruce maid was making a pleasant clatter in laying\nthe table. Caddagat was a very old style of house, and all the front\nrooms opened onto the veranda without any such preliminary as a hall,\ntherefore it was necessary to pass through the dining-room to my\nbedroom, which was a skillion at the back. While auntie paused for a\nmoment to give some orders to the maid, I noticed the heavy silver\nserviette rings I remembered so well, and the old-fashioned\ndinner-plates, and the big fire roaring in the broad white fireplace;\nbut more than all, the beautiful pictures on the walls and a table in a\ncorner strewn with papers, magazines, and several very new-looking\nbooks. On the back of one of these I saw \"Corelli\", and on\nanother--great joy!--was _Trilby_. From the adjoining apartment, which\nwas the drawing-room, came the sweet full tones of a beautiful piano.\nHere were three things for which I had been starving. An impulse to\nrevel in them immediately seized me. I felt like clearing the table at a\nbound, seizing and beginning to read both books, and rushing in to the\npiano and beginning to play upon it there and then, and examine the\npictures--all three things at once. Fortunately for the reputation of my\nsanity, however, aunt Helen had by this time conducted me to a pretty\nlittle bedroom, and saying it was to be mine, helped me to doff my cape\nand hat.\n\nWhile warming my fingers at the fire my eyes were arrested by a\nbeautiful portrait hanging above the mantelpiece. It represented a\nlovely girl in the prime of youth and beauty, and attired in floating\nwhite dinner draperies.\n\n\"Oh, aunt Helen! isn't she lovely? It's you, isn't it?\"\n\n\"No. Do you not recognize it as your mother? It was taken just before\nher marriage. I must leave you now, but come out as soon as you arrange\nyourself--your grandmother will be anxious to see you.\"\n\nWhen aunt Helen left me I plastered my hair down in an instant without\neven a glance in the mirror. I took not a particle of interest in my\nattire, and would go about dressed anyhow. This was one symptom which\ninclined my mother to the belief of my possible insanity, as to most\nyoung girls dress is a great delight. I had tried once or twice to make\nmyself look nice by dressing prettily, but, by my own judgment,\nconsidering I looked as ugly as ever, I had given it up as a bad job.\n\nThe time which I should have spent in arranging my toilet passed in\ngazing at my mother's portrait. It was one of the loveliest faces\nimaginable. The features may not have been perfect according to rule of\nthumb, but the expression was simply angelic--sweet, winning, gentle,\nand happy. I turned from the contemplation of it to another\nphotograph--one of my father--in a silver frame on the dressing-table.\nThis, too, was a fine countenance, possessed of well-cut features and\nrefined expression. This was the prince who had won Lucy Bossier from\nher home. I looked around my pretty bedroom--it had been my mother's in\nthe days of her maidenhood. In an exclusive city boarding-school, and\namid the pleasant surroundings of this home, her youth had been spent.\n\nI thought of a man and his wife at Possum Gully. The man was blear-eyed,\ndisreputable in appearance, and failed to fulfil his duties as a father\nand a citizen. The woman was work-roughened and temper-soured by endless\ncare and an unavailing struggle against poverty. Could that pair\npossibly be identical with this?\n\nThis was life as proved by my parents! What right had I to expect any\nbetter yield from it? I shut my eyes and shuddered at the possibilities\nand probabilities of my future. It was for this that my mother had\nyielded up her youth, freedom, strength; for this she had sacrificed the\ngreatest possession of woman.\n\nHere I made my way to the dining-room, where grannie was waiting for me\nand gave me another hug.\n\n\"Come here, child, and sit beside me near the fire; but first let me\nhave a look at you,\" and she held me at arm's length.\n\n\"Dear, oh, dear, what a little thing you are, and not a bit like any of\nyour relations! I am glad your skin is so nice and clear; all my\nchildren had beautiful complexions. Goodness me, I never saw such hair!\nA plait thicker than my arm and almost to your knees! It is that\nbeautiful bright brown like your aunt's. Your mother's was flaxen. I\nmust see your hair loose when you are going to bed. There is nothing I\nadmire so much as a beautiful head of hair.\"\n\nThe maid announced that dinner was ready, grannie vigorously rang a\nlittle bell, aunt Helen, a lady, and a gentleman appeared from the\ndrawing-room, and Mr Hawden came in from the back. I discovered that the\nlady and gentleman were a neighbouring squatter and a new governess he\nwas taking home. Grannie, seeing them pass that afternoon in the rain,\nhad gone out and prevailed upon them to spend the night at Caddagat.\n\nMr Hawden took no notice of me now, but showed off to the others for my\nbenefit. After dinner we had music and singing in the drawing-room. I\nwas enjoying it immensely, but grannie thought I had better go to bed,\nas I had been travelling since about midnight last night. I was neither\ntired nor sleepy, but knew it useless to protest, so bade every one good\nnight and marched off. Mr Hawden acknowledged my salute with great airs\nand stiffness, and aunt Helen whispered that she would come and see me\nby and by, if I was awake.\n\nGrannie escorted me to my room, and examined my hair. I shook it out for\nher inspection. It met with her approval in every way. She pronounced it\nbeautifully fine, silky, and wavy, and the most wonderful head of hair\nshe had seen out of a picture.\n\nA noise arose somewhere out in the back premises. Grannie went out to\nascertain the cause of it and did not return to me, so I extinguished my\nlamp and sat thinking in the glow of the firelight.\n\nFor the first time my thoughts reverted to my leave-taking from home. My\nfather had kissed me with no more warmth than if I had been leaving for\na day only; my mother had kissed me very coldly, saying shortly, \"It is\nto be hoped, Sybylla, that your behaviour to your grandmother will be an\nimprovement upon what it has ever been to me.\" Gertie was the only one\nwho had felt any sorrow at parting with me, and I knew that she was of\nsuch a disposition that I would be forgotten in a day or two. They would\nnever miss me, for I had no place in their affections. True, I was an\nundutiful child, and deserved none. I possessed no qualities that would\nwin either their pride or love, but my heart cried out in love for them.\n\nWould Gertie miss me tonight, as I would have missed her had our\npositions been reversed? Not she. Would my absence from the noisy\ntea-table cause a blank? I feared not.\n\nI thought of poor mother left toiling at home, and my heart grew heavy;\nI failed to remember my father's faults, but thought of his great\npatience with me in the years agone, and all my old-time love for him\nrenewed itself. Why, oh, why, would they not love me a little in return!\nCertainly I had never striven to be lovable. But see the love some have\nlavished upon them without striving for it! Why was I ugly and nasty and\nmiserable and useless--without a place in the world?\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER NINE\n\nAunt Helen's Recipe\n\n\n\"Dear me, Sybylla, not in bed yet, and tears, great big tears! Tell me\nwhat is the cause of them.\"\n\nIt was aunt Helen's voice; she had entered and lit the lamp.\n\nThere was something beautifully sincere and real about aunt Helen. She\nnever fussed over any one or pretended to sympathize just to make out\nhow nice she was. She was real, and you felt that no matter what wild or\nawful rubbish you talked to her it would never be retailed for any one's\namusement--and, better than all, she never lectured.\n\nShe sat down beside me, and I impulsively threw my arms around her neck\nand sobbed forth my troubles in a string. How there was no good in the\nworld, no use for me there, no one loved me or ever could on account of\nmy hideousness.\n\nShe heard me to the end and then said quietly, \"When you are fit to\nlisten I will talk to you.\"\n\nI controlled myself instantly and waited expectantly. What would she\nsay? Surely not that tame old yarn anent this world being merely a place\nof probation, wherein we were allowed time to fit ourselves for a\nbeautiful world to come. That old tune may be all very well for old\ncodgers tottering on the brink of the grave, but to young persons with\nyouth and romance and good health surging through their veins, it is\nmost boresome. Would she preach that it was flying in the face of\nprovidence to moan about my appearance? it being one of the greatest\nblessings I had, as it would save me from countless temptations to which\npretty girls are born. That was another piece of old croaking of the\njob's comforter order, of which I was sick unto death, as I am sure\nthere is not an ugly person in the world who thinks her lack of beauty a\nblessing to her. I need not have feared aunt Helen holding forth in that\nstrain. She always said something brave and comforting which made me\nashamed of myself and my selfish conceited egotism.\n\n\"I understand you, Sybylla,\" she said slowly and distinctly, \"but you\nmust not be a coward. There is any amount of love and good in the world,\nbut you must search for it. Being misunderstood is one of the trials we\nall must bear. I think that even the most common-minded person in the\nland has inner thoughts and feelings which no one can share with him,\nand the higher one's organization the more one must suffer in that\nrespect. I am acquainted with a great number of young girls, some of\nthem good and true, but you have a character containing more than any\nthree of them put together. With this power, if properly managed, you\ncan gain the almost universal love of your fellows. But you are wild and\nwayward, you must curb and strain your spirit and bring it into\nsubjection, else you will be worse than a person with the emptiest of\ncharacters. You will find that plain looks will not prevent you from\ngaining the _friendship_ love of your fellows--the only real love there\nis. As for the hot fleeting passion of the man for the maid, which is\nwrongfully designated love, I will not tell you not to think of it,\nknowing that it is human nature to demand it when arriving at a certain\nage; but take this comfort: it as frequently passes by on the other side\nof those with well-chiselled features as those with faces of plainer\nmould.\"\n\nShe turned her face away, sighed, and forgetful of my presence lapsed\ninto silence. I knew she was thinking of herself.\n\nLove, not _friendship_ love, for anyone knowing her must give her love\nand respect, but the other sort of love had passed her by.\n\nTwelve years before I went to Caddagat, when Helen Bossier had been\neighteen and one of the most beautiful and lovable girls in Australia,\nthere had come to Caddagat on a visit a dashing colonel of the name of\nBell, in the enjoyment of a most extended furlough for the benefit of\nhis health. He married aunt Helen and took her to some part of America\nwhere his regiment was stationed. I have heard them say she worshipped\nColonel Bell, but in less than a twelvemonth he tired of his lovely\nbride, and becoming enamoured of another woman, he tried to obtain a\ndivorce. On account of his wife's spotless character he was unable to do\nthis; he therefore deserted her and openly lived with the other woman as\nhis mistress. This forced aunt Helen to return to Caddagat, and her\nmother had induced her to sue for a judicial separation, which was\neasily obtained.\n\nWhen a woman is separated from her husband it is the religion of the\nworld at large to cast the whole blame on the wife. By reason of her\nyouth and purity Mrs Bell had not as much to suffer in this way as some\nothers. But, comparatively speaking, her life was wrecked. She had been\nhumiliated and outraged in the cruellest way by the man whom she loved\nand trusted. He had turned her adrift, neither a wife, widow, nor maid,\nand here she was, one of the most estimably lovable and noble women I\nhave ever met.\n\n\"Come, Sybylla,\" she said, starting up brightly, \"I have a plan--will\nyou agree to it? Come and take one good long look at yourself in the\nglass, then I will turn it to the wall, and you must promise me that for\nthree or four weeks you will not look in a mirror. I will put as many as\nI can out of your way, and you must avoid the remainder. During this\ntime I will take you in hand, and you must follow my directions\nimplicitly. Will you agree? You will be surprised what a nice-looking\nlittle girl I will make of you.\"\n\nOf course I agreed. I took a long and critical survey of myself in the\nglass. There was reflected a pair of hands, red and coarsened with rough\nwork, a round face, shiny and swollen with crying, and a small round\nfigure enshrouded in masses of hair falling in thick waves to within an\ninch or two of the knees. A very ugly spectacle, I thought. Aunt Helen\nturned the face of the large mirror flat against the wall, while I\nremarked despondently, \"you can make me only middling ugly, you must be\na magician.\"\n\n\"Come now, part of my recipe is that you must not think of yourself at\nall. I'll take you in hand in the morning. I hope you will like your\nroom; I have arranged it on purpose to suit you. And now good night, and\nhappy dreams.\"\n\nI awoke next morning in very fine spirits, and slithering out of my bed\nwith alacrity, revelled--literally wallowed--in the appointments of my\nroom. My poor old room at Possum Gully was lacking in barest\nnecessaries. We could not afford even a wash-hand basin and jug; Gertie,\nthe boys, and myself had to perform our morning ablutions in a leaky tin\ndish on a stool outside the kitchen door, which on cold frosty mornings\nwas a pretty peppery performance: but this room contained everything\ndear to the heart of girlhood. A lovely bed, pretty slippers, dainty\nwhite China-matting and many soft skins on the floor, and in one corner\na most artistic toilet set, and a wash-stand liberally supplied with a\ngreat variety of soap--some of it so exquisitely perfumed that I felt\ntempted to taste it. There were pretty pictures on the walls, and on a\ncommodious dressing-table a big mirror and large hand-glasses, with\ntheir faces to the wall at present. Hairpins, fancy combs, ribbons\ngalore, and a pretty work-basket greeted my sight, and with delight I\nswooped down upon the most excruciatingly lovely little writing-desk. It\nwas stuffed full with all kinds of paper of good quality--fancy, all\ncolours, sizes, and shapes, plain, foreign note, pens, ink, and a\ngenerous supply of stamps. I felt like writing a dozen letters there and\nthen, and was on the point of giving way to my inclination, when my\nattention was arrested by what I considered the gem of the whole\nturn-out. I refer to a nice little bookcase containing copies of all our\nAustralian poets, and two or three dozen novels which I had often longed\nto read. I read the first chapters of four of them, and then lost myself\nin Gordon, and sat on my dressing-table in my nightgown, regardless of\ncold, until brought to my senses by the breakfast-bell. I made great\npace, scrambled into my clothes helter-skelter, and appeared at table\nwhen the others had been seated and unfolded their serviettes.\n\nAunt Helen's treatment for making me presentable was the wearing of\ngloves and a shady hat every time I went outside; and she insisted upon\nme spending a proper time over my toilet, and would not allow me to\nencroach upon it with the contents of my bookshelf.\n\n\"Rub off some of your gloomy pessimism and cultivate a little more\nhealthy girlish vanity, and you will do very well,\" she would say.\n\nI observed these rites most religiously for three days. Then I\ncontracted a slight attack of influenza, and in poking around the\nkitchen, doing one of the things I oughtn't at the time I shouldn't, a\nservant-girl tipped a pot of boiling pot-liquor over my right foot,\nscalding it rather severely. Aunt Helen and grannie put me to bed, where\nI yelled with pain for hours like a mad Red Indian, despite their\napplying every alleviative possible. The combined forces of the burn and\ninfluenza made me a trifle dicky, so a decree went forth that I was to\nstay in bed until recovered from both complaints. This effectually\nprevented me from running in the way of any looking-glasses.\n\nI was not sufficiently ill to be miserable, and being a pampered invalid\nwas therefore fine fun. Aunt Helen was a wonderful nurse. She dressed my\nfoot splendidly every morning, and put it in a comfortable position many\ntimes throughout the day. Grannie brought me every dainty in the house,\nand sent special messengers to Gool-Gool for more. Had I been a\nprofessional glutton I would have been in paradise. Even Mr Hawden\ncondescended so far as to express his regret concerning the accident,\nand favoured me with visits throughout each day; and one Sunday his\ngallantry carried him to a gully where he plucked a bouquet of\nmaidenhair fern--the first of the season--and put them in a bowl beside\nmy bed. My uncle Julius, the only other member of the family besides the\nservants, was away \"up the country\" on some business or another, and was\nnot expected home for a month or so.\n\nThe Bossiers and Beechams were leaders of swelldom among the\nsquattocracy up the country, and firm and intimate friends. The Beechams\nresided at Five-Bob Downs, twelve miles from Caddagat, and were a family\ncomposed of two maiden ladies and their nephew, Harold. One of these\nladies was aunt Helen's particular friend, and the other had stood in\nthe same capacity to my mother in days gone by, but of late years, on\naccount of her poverty, mother had been too proud to keep up\ncommunication with her. As for Harold Beecham, he was nearly as much at\nhome at Caddagat as at Five-Bob Downs. He came and went with that\npleasant familiarity practised between congenial spirits among\nsquatterdom. The Bossiers and Beechams were congenial spirits in every\nway--they lived in the one sphere and held the one set of ideas, the\nonly difference between them, and that an unnoticeable one, being that\nthe Bossiers, though in comfortable circumstances, were not at all rich,\nwhile Harold Beecham was immensely wealthy. When my installation in the\nrole of invalid took place, one Miss Beecham was away in Melbourne, and\nthe other not well enough to come and see me, but Harold came regularly\nto inquire how I was progressing. He always brought me a number of\nbeautiful apples. This kindness was because the Caddagat orchard had\nbeen too infested with codlin moth for grannie to save any last season.\n\nAunt Helen used to mischievously tease me about this attention.\n\n\"Here comes Harry Beecham with some more apples,\" she would say. \"No\ndoubt he is far more calculating and artful than I thought he was\ncapable of being. He is taking time by the forelock and wooing you ere\nhe sees you, and so will take the lead. Young ladies are in the minority\nup this way, and every one is snapped up as soon as she arrives.\"\n\n\"You'd better tell him how ugly I am, auntie, so that he will carry\napples twelve miles on his own responsibility, and when he sees me won't\nbe vexed that all his work has been for nothing. Perhaps, though, it\nwould be better not to describe me, or I will get no more apples,\" I\nwould reply.\n\n\n\nAunt Helen was a clever needlewoman. She made all grannie's dresses and\nher own. Now she was making some for me, which, however, I was not to\nsee until I wore them. Aunt Helen had this as a pleasant surprise, and\nwent to the trouble of blindfolding me while I was being fitted. While\nin bed, grannie and auntie being busy, I was often left hours alone, and\nduring that time devoured the contents of my bookshelf.\n\nThe pleasure, so exquisite as to be almost pain, which I derived from\nthe books, and especially the Australian poets, is beyond description.\nIn the narrow peasant life of Possum Gully I had been deprived of\ncompanionship with people of refinement and education who would talk of\nthe things I loved; but, at last here was congeniality, here was\ncompanionship.\n\nThe weird witchery of mighty bush, the breath of wide sunlit plains, the\nsound of camp-bells and jingle of hobble chains, floating on the soft\ntwilight breezes, had come to these men and had written a tale on their\nhearts as had been written on mine. The glory of the starlit heavens,\nthe mighty wonder of the sea, and the majesty of thunder had come home\nto them, and the breathless fulness of the sunset hour had whispered of\nsomething more than the humour of tomorrow's weather. The wind and rain\nhad a voice which spoke to Kendall, and he too had endured the misery of\nlack of companionship. Gordon, with his sad, sad humanism and bitter\ndisappointment, held out his hand and took me with him. The regret of it\nall was I could never meet them--Byron, Thackeray, Dickens, Longfellow,\nGordon, Kendall, the men I loved, all were dead; but, blissful thought!\nCaine, Paterson, and Lawson were still living, breathing human\nbeings--two of them actually countrymen, fellow Australians!\n\nI pored with renewed zeal over the terse realism and pathos of Lawson,\nand enjoyed Paterson's redolence of the rollicking side of the wholesome\nlife beneath these sunny skies, which he depicted with grand touches of\npower flashing here and there. I learnt them by heart, and in that\ngloriously blue receptacle, by and by, where many pleasant youthful\ndreams are stowed, I put the hope that one day I would clasp hands with\nthem, and feel and know the unspeakable comfort and heart-rest of\ncongenial companionship.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER TEN\n\nEverard Grey\n\n\nUncle Julius had taken a run down to Sydney before returning to\nCaddagat, and was to be home during the first week in September,\nbringing with him Everard Grey. This young gentleman always spent\nChristmas at Caddagat, but as he had just recovered from an illness he\nwas coming up for a change now instead. Having heard much of him, I was\ncurious to see him. He was grandmamma's adopted son, and was the orphan\nof very aristocratic English parents who had left him to the\nguardianship of distant relatives. They had proved criminally\nunscrupulous. By finding a flaw in deeds, or something which none but\nlawyers understand, they had deprived him of all his property and left\nhim to sink or swim. Grannie had discovered, reared, and educated him.\nAmong professions he had chosen the bar, and was now one of Sydney's\nmost promising young barristers. His foster-mother was no end proud of\nhim, and loved him as her own son.\n\nIn due time a telegram arrived from uncle Julius, containing\ninstructions for the buggy to be sent to Gool-Gool to meet him and\nEverard Grey.\n\nBy this time I had quite recovered from influenza and my accident, and\nas they would not arrive till near nightfall, for their edification I\nwas to be dressed in full-blown dinner costume, also I was to be\nfavoured with a look at my reflection in a mirror for the first time\nsince my arrival.\n\nDuring the afternoon I was dispatched by grannie on a message some miles\naway, and meeting Mr Hawden some distance from the house, he took it\nupon himself to accompany me. Everywhere I went he followed after, much\nto my annoyance, because grannie gave me many and serious talkings-to\nabout the crime of encouraging young men.\n\nFrank Hawden had changed his tune, and told me now that it mattered not\nthat I was not pretty, as pretty or not I was the greatest brick of a\ngirl he had met. His idea for this opinion was that I was able to talk\ntheatres with him, and was the only girl there, and because he had\narrived at that overflowing age when young men have to be partial to\nsome female whether she be ugly or pretty, fat or lean, old or young.\nThat I should be the object of these puerile emotions in a fellow like\nFrank Hawden, filled me with loathing and disgust.\n\nIt was late in the afternoon when Hawden and I returned, and the buggy\nwas to be seen a long way down the road, approaching at the\ngoing-for-the-doctor pace at which uncle Julius always drove.\n\nAunt Helen hustled me off to dress, but I was only half-rigged when they\narrived, and so was unable to go out and meet them. Uncle Julius\ninquired for that youngster of Lucy's, and aunt Helen replied that she\nwould be forthcoming when they were dressed for dinner. The two\ngentlemen took a nip, to put a little heart in them uncle Julius said,\nand auntie Helen came to finish my toilet while they were making theirs.\n\n\"There now, you have nothing to complain of in the way of looks,\" she\nremarked at the completion of the ceremony. \"Come and have a good look\nat yourself.\"\n\nI was decked in my first evening dress, as it was a great occasion. It\nwas only on the rarest occasion that we donned full war-paint at\nCaddagat. I think that evening dress is one of the prettiest and most\nidiotic customs extant. What can be more foolish than to endanger one's\nhealth by exposing at night the chest and arms--two of the most vital\nspots of the body--which have been covered all day? On the other hand,\nwhat can be more beautiful than a soft white bosom rising and falling\namid a dainty nest of silk and lace? Every woman looks more soft and\nfeminine in a _decollete_ gown. And is there any of the animal lines\nknown pleasanter to the eye than the contour of shapely arms? Some there\nare who cry down evening dress as being immodest and indecent. These\nwill be found among those whose chest and arms will not admit of being\ndisplayed, or among those who, not having been reared to the custom,\ndislike it with many other things from want of use.\n\nAunt Helen took me into the wide old drawing-room, now brilliantly\nlighted. A heavy lamp was on each of the four brackets in the corners,\nand another swung from the centre of the ceiling, and candelabra threw\nmany lights from the piano. Never before had I seen this room in such a\nblaze of light. During the last week or two aunt Helen and I had\noccupied it every night, but we never lighted more than a single candle\non the piano. This had been ample light for our purpose. Aunt Helen\nwould sing in her sweet sad voice all the beautiful old songs I loved,\nwhile I curled myself on a mat at her side and read books--the music\noften compelling me to forget the reading, and the reading occasionally\nrendering me deaf to the music; but through both ever came the solemn\nrush of the stream outside in its weird melancholy, like a wind\nceaselessly endeavouring to outstrip a wild vain regret which\nrelentlessly pursued.\n\n\"Your uncle Julius always has the drawing-room lighted like this; he\ndoes not believe in shadowy half light--calls it sentimental bosh,\" said\naunt Helen in explanation.\n\n\"Is uncle like that?\" I remarked, but my question remained unanswered.\nLeaving a hand-mirror with me, aunt Helen had slipped away.\n\nOne wall of the drawing-room was monopolized by a door, a big bookcase,\nand a heavy bevelled-edged old-fashioned mirror--the two last-mentioned\narticles reaching from floor to ceiling. Since my arrival the face of\nthe mirror had been covered, but this evening the blue silken curtains\nwere looped up, and it was before this that I stood.\n\nI looked, and looked again in pleased surprise. I beheld a young girl\nwith eyes and skin of the clearest and brightest, and lips of brilliant\nscarlet, and a chest and pair of arms which would pass muster with the\nbest. If Nature had been in bad humour when moulding my face, she had\nused her tools craftily in forming my figure. Aunt Helen had proved a\nclever maid and dressmaker. My pale blue cashmere dress fitted my fully\ndeveloped yet girlish figure to perfection. Some of my hair fell in\ncunning little curls on my forehead; the remainder, tied simply with a\npiece of ribbon, hung in thick waves nearly to my knees. My toilet had\naltered me almost beyond recognition. It made me look my age--sixteen\nyears and ten months--whereas before, when dressed carelessly and with\nmy hair plastered in a tight coil, people not knowing me would not\nbelieve that I was under twenty. Joy and merriment lit up my face, which\nglowed with youth, health, and happiness, which rippled my lips in\nsmiles, which displayed a splendid set of teeth, and I really believe\nthat on that night I did not look out of the way ugly.\n\nI was still admiring my reflection when aunt Helen returned to say that\nEverard and uncle Julius were smoking on the veranda and asking for me.\n\n\"What do you think of yourself, Sybylla?\"\n\n\"Oh, aunt Helen, tell me that there is something about me not completely\nhideous!\"\n\nShe took my face between her hands, saying:\n\n\"Silly child, there are some faces with faultless features, which would\nreceive nothing more than an indifferent glance while beside other faces\nwhich might have few if any pretensions to beauty. Yours is one of those\nlast mentioned.\"\n\n\"But that does not say I am not ugly.\"\n\n\"No one would dream of calling you plain, let alone ugly; brilliant is\nthe word which best describes you.\"\n\nUncle Julius had the upper part of his ponderous figure arrayed in a\nfrock-coat. He did not take kindly to what he termed \"those skittish\nsparrow-tailed affairs\". Frock-coats suited him, but I am not partial to\nthem on every one. They look well enough on a podgy, fat, or broad man,\nbut on a skinny one they hang with such a forlorn, dying-duck\nexpression, that they invariably make me laugh.\n\nJulius John Bossier, better known as J. J. Bossier, and better still as\nJay-Jay--big, fat, burly, broad, a jovial bachelor of forty, too fond of\nall the opposite sex ever to have settled his affections on one in\nparticular--was well known, respected, and liked from Wagga Wagga to\nAlbury, Forbes to Dandaloo, Bourke to Hay, from Tumut to Monaro, and\nback again to Peak Hill, as a generous man, a straight goer in business\nmatters, and a jolly good fellow all round.\n\nI was very proud to call him uncle.\n\n\"So this is yourself, is it!\" he exclaimed, giving me a tremendous hug.\n\n\"Oh, uncle,\" I expostulated, \"wipe your old kisses off! Your breath\nsmells horribly of whisky and tobacco.\"\n\n\"Gammon, that's what makes my kisses so nice!\" he answered; and, after\nholding me at arm's-length for inspection, \"By George, you're a\nwonderful-looking girl! You're surely not done growing yet, though! You\nare such a little nipper. I could put you in my pocket with ease. You\naren't a scrap like your mother. I'll give the next shearer who passes a\nshilling to cut that hair off. It would kill a dog in the hot weather.\"\n\n\"Everard, this is my niece, Sybylla\" (aunt Helen was introducing us).\n\"You will have to arrange yourselves--what relation you are, and how to\naddress each other.\"\n\nThe admiration expressed in his clear sharp eyes gave me a sensation\ndifferent to any I had ever experienced previously.\n\n\"I suppose I'm a kind of uncle and brother in one, and as either\nrelationship entitles me to a kiss, I'm going to take one,\" he said in a\nvery gallant manner.\n\n\"You may take one if you can,\" I said with mischievous defiance,\nspringing off the veranda into the flower-garden. He accepted my\nchallenge, and, being lithe as a cat, a tremendous scamper ensued. Round\nand round the flower-beds we ran. Uncle Jay-Jay's beard opened in a\nbroad smile, which ended in a loud laugh. Everard Grey's coat-tails flew\nin the breeze he made, and his collar was too high for athletic\npurposes. I laughed too, and was lost, and we returned to the\nveranda--Everard in triumph, and I feeling very red and uncomfortable.\n\nGrannie had arrived upon the scene, looking the essence of brisk\nrespectability in a black silk gown and a white lace cap. She cast on me\na glance of severe disapproval, and denounced my conduct as shameful;\nbut uncle Jay-Jay's eyes twinkled as he dexterously turned the subject.\n\n\"Gammon, mother! I bet you were often kissed when that youngster's age.\nI bet my boots now that you can't count the times you did the same thing\nyourself. Now, confess.\"\n\nGrannie's face melted in a smile as she commenced a little anecdote,\nwith that pathetic beginning, \"When I was young.\"\n\nAunt Helen sent me inside lest I should catch cold, and I stationed\nmyself immediately inside the window so that I should not miss the\nconversation. \"I should think your niece is very excitable,\" Mr Grey was\nsaying to aunt Helen.\n\n\"Oh, very.\"\n\n\"Yes; I have never seen any but very highly strung temperaments have\nthat transparent brilliance of expression.\"\n\n\"She is very variable--one moment all joy, and the next the reverse.\"\n\n\"She has a very striking face. I don't know what it is that makes it\nso.\"\n\n\"It may be her complexion,\" said aunt Helen; \"her skin is whiter than\nthe fairest blonde, and her eyebrows and lashes very dark. Be very\ncareful you do not say anything that would let her know you think her\nnot nice looking. She broods over her appearance in such a morbid\nmanner. It is a weak point with her, so be careful not to sting her\nsensitiveness in that respect.\"\n\n\"Plain-looking! Why, I think she has one of the most fascinating faces\nI've seen for some time, and her eyes are simply magnificent. What\ncolour are they?\"\n\n\"The grass is not bad about Sydney. I think I will send a truck of fat\nwethers away next week,\" said uncle Jay-Jay to grannie.\n\n\"It is getting quite dark. Let's get in to dinner at once,\" said\ngrannie.\n\nDuring the meal I took an opportunity of studying the appearance of\nEverard Grey. He had a typically aristocratic English face, even to the\ncold rather heartless expression, which is as established a point of an\nEnglish blue blood as an arched neck is of a thoroughbred horse.\n\nA ringer, whose wife had been unexpectedly confined, came for grannie\nwhen dinner was over, and the rest of us had a delightful musical\nevening. Uncle Jay-Jay bawled \"The Vicar of Bray\" and \"Drink, Puppy,\nDrink\" in a stentorian bass voice, holding me on his knee, pinching,\ntickling, pulling my hair, and shaking me up and down between whiles. Mr\nHawden favoured us by rendering \"The Holy City\". Everard Grey sang\nseveral new songs, which was a great treat, as he had a well-trained and\nmusical baritone voice. He was a veritable carpet knight, and though not\na fop, was exquisitely dressed in full evening costume, and showed his\nlong pedigreed blood in every line of his clean-shaven face and tall\nslight figure. He was quite a champion on the piano, and played aunt\nHelen's accompaniments while he made her sing song after song. When she\nwas weary uncle Jay-Jay said to me, \"Now it's your turn, me fine lady.\nWe've all done something to keep things rolling but you. Can you sing?\"\n\n\"No,\"\n\n\"Can this youngster sing, Helen?\"\n\n\"She sings very nicely to herself sometimes, but I do not know how she\nwould manage before company. Will you try something, Sybylla?\"\n\nUncle Jay-Jay waited to hear no more, but carrying me to the\nmusic-stool, and depositing me thereon, warned me not to attempt to\nleave it before singing something.\n\nTo get away to myself, where I was sure no one could bear me, and sing\nand sing till I made the echoes ring, was one of the chief joys of my\nexistence, but I had never made a success in singing to company. Besides\nlosing all nerve, I had a very queer voice, which every one remarked.\nHowever, tonight I made an effort in my old favourite, \"Three Fishers\nWent Sailing\". The beauty of the full-toned Ronisch piano, and Everard's\nclever and sympathetic accompanying, caused me to forget my audience,\nand sing as though to myself alone, forgetting that my voice was odd.\n\nWhen the song ceased Mr Grey wheeled abruptly on the stool and said, \"Do\nyou know that you have one of the most wonderful natural voices I have\nheard. Why, there is a fortune in such a voice if it were, trained! Such\nchest-notes, such feeling, such rarity of tone!\"\n\n\"Don't be sarcastic, Mr Grey,\" I said shortly.\n\n\"Upon my word as a man, I mean every word I say,\" he returned\nenthusiastically.\n\nEverard Grey's opinion on artistic matters was considered worth having.\nHe dabbled in all the arts--writing, music, acting, and sketching, and\nwent to every good concert and play in Sydney. Though he was clever at\nlaw, it was whispered by some that he would wind up on the stage, as he\nhad a great leaning that way.\n\nI walked away from the piano treading on air. Would I really make a\nsinger? I with the voice which had often been ridiculed; I who had often\nblasphemously said that I would sell my soul to be able to sing just\npassably. Everard Grey's opinion gave me an intoxicated sensation of\njoy.\n\n\"Can you recite?\" he inquired.\n\n\"Yes,\" I answered firmly.\n\n\"Give us something,\" said uncle Jay-Jay.\n\nI recited Longfellow's \"The Slave's Dream\". Everard Grey was quite as\nenthusiastic over this as he had been about my singing.\n\n\"Such a voice! Such depth and width! Why, she could fill the Centennial\nHall without an effort. All she requires is training.\"\n\n\"By George, she's a regular dab! But I wish she would give us something\nnot quite so glum,\" said uncle Jay-Jay.\n\nI let myself go. Carried away by I don't know what sort of a spirit, I\nexclaimed, \"Very well, I will, if you will wait till I make up, and will\nhelp me.\"\n\nI disappeared for a few minutes, and returned made up as a fat old Irish\nwoman, with a smudge of dirt on my face. There was a general laugh.\n\nWould Mr Hawden assist me? Of course he was only too delighted, and\nflattered that I had called upon him in preference to the others. What\nwould he do?\n\nI sat him on a footstool, so that I might with facility put my hand on\nhis sandy hair, and turning to uncle, commenced:\n\n\"Shure, sir, seeing it was a good bhoy yez were afther to run errants,\nit's meself that has brought this youngsther for yer inspection. It's a\njool ye'll have in him. Shure I rared him meself, and he says his\nprayers every morning. Kape sthill, honey! Faith, ye're not afraid of\nyer poor old mammy pullin' yer beautiful cur-r-rls?\"\n\nUncle Jay-Jay was laughing like fun; even aunt Helen deigned to smile;\nand Everard was looking on with critical interest.\n\n\"Go on,\" said uncle. But Mr Hawden got huffy at the ridicule which he\nsuspected I was calling down upon him, and jumped up looking fit to eat\nme.\n\nI acted several more impromptu scenes with the other occupants of the\ndrawing-room. Mr Hawden emitted \"Humph!\" from the corner where he\ngrumpily sat, but Mr Grey was full of praise.\n\n\"Splendid! splendid!\" he exclaimed. \"You say you have not had an hour's\ntraining, and never saw a play. Such versatility. Your fortune would be\nmade on the stage. It is a sin to have such exceptional talent wasting\nin the bush. I must take her to Sydney and put her under a good master.\"\n\n\"Indeed, you'll do no such thing,\" said uncle. \"I'll keep her here to\nliven up the old barracks. You've got enough puppets on the stage\nwithout a niece of mine ever being there.\"\n\nI went to bed that night greatly elated. Flattery is sweet to youth. I\nfelt pleased with myself, and imagined, as I peeped in the\nlooking-glass, that I was not half bad-looking after all.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER ELEVEN\n\nYah!\n\n\n\"Bah, you hideous animal! Ha ha! Your peerless conceit does you credit.\nSo you actually imagined that by one or two out of every hundred you\nmight be considered passable. You are the most uninteresting person in\nthe world. You are small and nasty and bad, and every other thing that's\nabominable. That's what you are.\"\n\nThis address I delivered to my reflection in the glass next morning. My\nelation of the previous night was as flat as a pancake. Dear, oh dear,\nwhat a fool I had been to softly swallow the flattery of Mr Grey without\na single snub in return! To make up for my laxity, if he continued to\namuse himself by plastering my vanity with the ointment of flattery, I\ndetermined to serve up my replies to him red-hot and well seasoned with\npepper.\n\nI finished my toilet, and in a very what's-the-good-o'-anything mood\ntook a last glance in the glass to say, \"You're ugly, you're ugly and\nuseless; so don't forget that and make a fool of yourself again.\"\n\nI was in the habit of doing this; it had long ago taken the place of a\nmorning prayer. I said this, that by familiarity it might lose a little\nof its sting when I heard it from other lips, but somehow it failed in\nefficacy.\n\nI was late for breakfast that morning. All the others were half through\nthe meal when I sat down.\n\nGrannie had not come home till after twelve, but was looking as brisk as\nusual.\n\n\"Come, Sybylla, I suppose this comes of sitting up too late, as I was\nnot here to hunt you to bed. You are always very lively at night, but\nit's a different tune in the morning,\" she said, when giving me the\nusual morning hug.\n\n\"When I was a nipper of your age, if I didn't turn out like greased\nlightning every morning, I was assisted by a little strap oil,\" remarked\nuncle Jay-Jay.\n\n\"Sybylla should be excused this morning,\" interposed Mr Grey. \"She\nentertained us for hours last night. Little wonder if she feels languid\nthis morning.\"\n\n\"Entertained you I What did she do?\" queried grannie.\n\n\"Many things. Do you know, gran, that you are robbing the world of an\nartist by keeping Sybylla hidden away in the bush? I must persuade you\nto let me take her to Sydney and have her put under the best masters in\nSydney.\"\n\n\"Under masters for what?\"\n\n\"Elocution and singing.\"\n\n\"I couldn't afford it.\"\n\n\"But I'd bear the expense myself. It would only be returning a trifle of\nall you have done for me.\"\n\n\"What nonsense! What would you have her do when she was taught?\"\n\n\"Go on the stage, of course. With her talent and hair she would cause\nquite a sensation.\"\n\nNow grannie's notions re the stage were very tightly laced. All actors\nand actresses, from the lowest circus man up to the most glorious\ncantatrice, were people defiled in the sight of God, and utterly outside\nthe pale of all respectability, when measured with her code of morals.\n\nShe turned energetically in her chair, and her keen eyes flashed with\nscorn and anger as she spoke.\n\n\"Go on the stage! A grand-daughter of mine! Lucy's eldest child! An\nactress--a vile, low, brazen hussy! Use the gifts God has given her with\nwhich to do good in showing off to a crowd of vile bad men! I would\nrather see her struck dead at my feet this instant! I would rather see\nher shear off her hair and enter a convent this very hour. Child,\npromise you will never be a bold bad actress.\"\n\n\"I will never be a _bold bad_ actress, grannie,\" I said, putting great\nstress on the adjectives, and bringing out the actress very faintly.\n\n\"Yes,\" she continued, calming down, \"I'm sure you have not enough bad in\nyou. You may he boisterous, and not behave with sufficient propriety\nsometimes, but I don't think you are wicked enough to ever make an\nactress.\"\n\nEverard attempted to defend his case.\n\n\"Look here, gran, that's a very exploded old notion about the stage\nbeing a low profession. It might have been once, but it is quite the\nreverse nowadays. There are, of course, low people on the stage, as\nthere are in all walks of life. I grant you that; but if people are good\nthey can be good on the stage as well as anywhere else. On account of a\nlittle prejudice it would be a sin to rob Sybylla of the brilliant\ncareer she might have.\"\n\n\"Career!\" exclaimed his foster-mother, catching at the word. \"Career!\nThat is all girls think of now, instead of being good wives and mothers\nand attending to their homes and doing what God intended. All they think\nof is gadding about and being fast, and ruining themselves body and\nsoul. And the men are as bad to encourage them,\" looking severely at\nEverard.\n\n\"There is a great deal of truth in what you say, gran, I admit. You can\napply it to many of our girls, I am sorry to confess, but Sybylla could\nnot be brought under that classification. You must look at her in a\ndifferent way. If--\"\n\n\"I look at her as the child of respectable people, and will not have the\nstage mentioned in connection with her.\" Here Grannie thumped her fist\ndown on the table and there was silence, complete, profound. Few dared\nargue with Mrs Bossier.\n\nDear old lady, she was never angry long, and in a minute or two she\nproceeded with her breakfast, saying quite pleasantly:\n\n\"Never mention such a subject to me again; but I'll tell you what you\ncan do. Next autumn, some time in March or April, when the\nfruit-preserving and jam-making are done with, Helen can take the child\nto Sydney for a month or so, and you can show them round. It will be a\ngreat treat for Sybylla as she has never been in Sydney.\"\n\n\"That's right, let's strike a bargain on that, gran,\" said Everard.\n\n\"Yes; it's a bargain, if I hear no more about the stage. God intends His\ncreatures for a better life than that.\"\n\nAfter breakfast I was left to entertain Everard for some while. We had a\nfine time. He was a perfect gentleman and a clever conversationalist.\n\nI was always desirous of enjoying the company of society people who were\nwell bred and lived according to etiquette, and possessed of leisure and\nculture sufficient to fill their minds with something more than the\nprice of farm produce and a hard struggle for existence. Hitherto I had\nonly read of such or seen them in pictures, but here was a real live\none, and I seized my opportunity with vim. At my questioning and evident\ninterest in his talk he told me of all the latest plays, actors, and\nactresses with whom he was acquainted, and described the fashionable\nballs, dinners, and garden-parties he attended. Having exhausted this\nsubject, we fell to discussing books, and I recited snatches of poems\ndear to me. Everard placed his hands upon my shoulders and said:\n\n\"Sybylla, do you know you are a most wonderful girl? Your figure is\nperfect, your style refreshing, and you have a most interesting face. It\nis as ever-changing as a kaleidoscope--sometimes merry, then stern,\noften sympathetic, and always sad when at rest. One would think you had\nhad some sorrow in your life.\"\n\nLifting my skirt at either side, I bowed several times very low in what\nI called my stage bow, and called into requisition my stage smile, which\ndisplayed two rows of teeth as white and perfect as any twenty-guinea\nset turned out on a gold plate by a fashionable dentist.\n\n\"The handsome gentleman is very kind to amuse himself at the expense of\na little country bumpkin, but he would do well to ascertain if his\nflattery would go down before administering it next time,\" I said\nsarcastically, and I heard him calling to me as I abruptly went off to\nshut myself in my room.\n\n\"How dare anyone ridicule me by paying idle brainless compliments! I\nknew I was ugly, and did not want any one to perjure his soul pretending\nthey thought differently. What right had I to be small? Why wasn't I\npossessed of a big aquiline nose and a tall commanding figure?\" Thus I\nsat in burning discontent and ill-humour until soothed by the scent of\nroses and the gleam of soft spring sunshine which streamed in through my\nopen window. Some of the flower-beds in the garden were completely\ncarpeted with pansy blossoms, all colours, and violets-blue and white,\nsingle and double. The scent of mignonette, jonquils, and narcissi\nfilled the air. I revelled in rich perfumes, and these tempted me forth.\nMy ruffled feelings gave way before the delights of the old garden. I\ncollected a number of vases, and, filling them with water, set them on a\ntable in the veranda near one of the drawing-room windows. I gathered\nlapfuls of the lovely blossoms, and commenced arranging them in the\nvases.\n\nPart of the old Caddagat house was built of slabs, and one of the wooden\nwalls ran along the veranda side of the drawing-room, so the songs aunt\nHelen and Everard Grey were trying to the piano came as a sweet\naccompaniment to my congenial task.\n\nPresently they left off singing and commenced talking. Under the same\ncircumstances a heroine of a story would have slipped away; or, if that\nwere impossible without discovery, she would have put her fingers in her\nears, and would have been in a terrible state of agitation lest she\nshould hear something not intended for her. I did not come there with a\nview to eavesdropping. It is a degradation to which I never stoop. I\nthought they were aware of my presence on the veranda; but it appears\nthey were not, as they began to discuss me (wonderfully interesting\nsubject to myself), and I stayed there, without one word of disapproval\nfrom my conscience, to listen to their conversation.\n\n\"My word, didn't gran make a to-do this morning when I proposed to train\nSybylla for the stage! Do you know that girl is simply reeking with\ntalent; I must have her trained. I will keep bringing the idea before\ngran until she gets used to it. I'll work the\nwe-should-use-the-gifts-God-has-given-us racket for all it is worth, and\nyou might use your influence too, Helen.\"\n\n\"No, Everard; there are very few who succeed on the stage. I would not\nuse my influence, as it is a life of which I do not approve.\"\n\n\"But Sybylla _would_ succeed. I am a personal friend of the leading\nmanagers, and my influence would help her greatly.\"\n\n\"Yes; but what would you do with her? A young gentleman couldn't take\ncharge of a girl and bring her out without ruining her reputation. There\nwould be no end of scandal, as the sister theory would only be\nnonsense.\"\n\n\"There is another way; I could easily stop scandal.\"\n\n\"Everard, what do you mean!\"\n\n\"I mean marriage,\" he replied deliberately.\n\n\"Surely, boy, you must be dreaming! You have only seen her for an hour\nor two. I don't believe in these sudden attachments.\"\n\nPerhaps she here thought of one (her own) as sudden, which had not ended\nhappily.\n\n\"Everard, don't do anything rashly. You know you are very fickle and\nconsidered a lady-killer--be merciful to my poor little Sybylla, I pray.\nIt is just one of your passing fancies. Don't wile her passionate young\nheart away and then leave her to pine and die.\"\n\n\"I don't think she is that sort,\" he replied laughingly.\n\n\"No, she would not die, but would grow into a cynic and sceptic, which\nis the worst of fates. Let her alone. Flirt as much as you will with\nsociety belles who understand the game, but leave my country maiden\nalone. I hope to mould her into a splendid character yet.\"\n\n\"But, Helen, supposing I am in earnest at last, you don't think I'd make\nher a bad old hubby, do you?\"\n\n\"She is not the girl for you. You are not the man who could ever control\nher. What I say may not be complimentary but it is true. Besides, she is\nnot seventeen yet, and I do not approve of romantic young girls throwing\nthemselves into matrimony. Let them develop their womanhood first.\"\n\n\"Then I expect I had better hide my attractions under a bushel during\nthe remainder of my stay at Caddagat?\"\n\n\"Yes. Be as nice to the child as you like, but mind, none of those\nlittle ladies'-man attentions with which it is so easy to steal--\"\n\nI waited to hear no more, but, brimming over with a mixture of emotions,\ntore through the garden and into the old orchard. Bees were busy, and\ncountless bright-coloured butterflies flitted hither and thither,\nsipping from hundreds of trees, white or pink with bloom--their beauty\nwas lost upon me. I stood ankle-deep in violets, where they had run wild\nunder a gnarled old apple-tree, and gave way to my wounded vanity.\n\n\"Little country maiden, indeed! There's no need for him to bag his\nattractions up. If he exerted himself to the utmost of his ability, he\ncould not make me love him. I'm not a child. I saw through him in the\nfirst hour. There's not enough in him to win my love. I'll show him I\nthink no more of him than of the caterpillars on the old tree there. I'm\nnot a booby that will fall in love with every gussie I see. Bah, there's\nno fear of that! I hate and detest men!\"\n\n\"I suppose you are rehearsing some more airs to show off with tonight,\"\nsneered a voice behind me.\n\n\"No, I'm realisticing; and how _dare_ you thrust your obnoxious presence\nbefore me when I wish to be alone! Haven't I often shown--\"\n\n\"While a girl is disengaged, any man who is her equal has the right to\npay his addresses to her if he is in earnest,\" interrupted Mr Hawden. It\nwas he who stood before me.\n\n\"I am well aware of that,\" I replied. \"But it is a woman's privilege to\nrepel those attentions if distasteful to her. You seem disinclined to\naccord me that privilege.\"\n\nHaving delivered this retort, I returned to the house, leaving him\nstanding there looking the fool he was.\n\nI do not believe in spurning the love of a blackfellow if he behaves in\na manly way; but Frank Hawden was such a drivelling mawkish style of\nsweetheart that I had no patience with him.\n\nAunt Helen and Everard had vacated the drawing-room, so I plumped down\non the piano-stool and dashed into Kowalski's galop, from that into\n\"Gaite de Coeur\" until I made the piano dance and tremble like a thing\npossessed. My annoyance faded, and I slowly played that saddest of\nwaltzes, \"Weber's Last\". I became aware of a presence in the room, and,\nfacing about, confronted Everard Grey.\n\n\"How long have you been here?\" I demanded sharply.\n\n\"Since you began to play. Where on earth did you learn to play? Your\nexecution is splendid. Do sing 'Three Fishers', please.\"\n\n\"Excuse me; I haven't time now. Besides I am not competent to sing to\nyou,\" I said brusquely, and made my exit.\n\n\"Mr Hawden wants you, Sybylla,\" called aunt Helen. \"See what he wants\nand let him get away to his work, or your grannie will be vexed to see\nhim loitering about all the morning.\"\n\n\"Miss Sybylla,\" he began, when we were left alone, \"I want to apologize\nto you. I had no right to plague you, but it all comes of the way I love\nyou. A fellow gets jealous at the least little thing, you know.\"\n\n\"Bore me with no more such trash,\" I said, turning away in disgust.\n\n\"But, Miss Sybylla, what am I to do with it?\"\n\n\"Do with what?\"\n\n\"My love.\"\n\n\"Love!\" I retorted scornfully. \"There is no such thing.\"\n\n\"But there is, and I have found it.\"\n\n\"Well, you stick to it--that's my advice to you. It will be a treasure.\nIf you send it to my father he will get it bottled up and put it in the\nGoulburn museum. He has sent several things there already.\"\n\n\"Don't make such a game of a poor devil. You know I can't do that.\"\n\n\"Bag it up, then; put a big stone to make it sink, and pitch it in the\nriver.\"\n\n\"You'll rue this,\" he said savagely.\n\n\"I may or may not,\" I sang over my shoulder as I departed.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER TWELVE\n\nOne Grand Passion\n\n\nI had not the opportunity of any more private interviews with Everard\nGrey till one morning near his departure, when we happened to be alone\non the veranda.\n\n\"Well, Miss Sybylla,\" he began, \"when I arrived I thought you and I\nwould have been great friends; but we have not progressed at all. How do\nyou account for that?\"\n\nAs he spoke he laid his slender shapely hand kindly upon my head. He was\nvery handsome and winning, and moved in literary, musical, and artistic\nsociety--a man from my world, a world away.\n\nOh, what pleasure I might have derived from companionship with him! I\nbit my lip to keep back the tears. Why did not social arrangements allow\na man and a maid to be chums--chums as two men or two maids may be to\neach other, enjoying each other without thought beyond pure platonic\nfriendship? But no; it could not be. I understood the conceit of men.\nShould I be very affable, I feared Everard Grey would imagine he had\nmade a conquest of me. On the other hand, were I glum he would think the\nsame, and that I was trying to hide my feelings behind a mask of\nbrusquerie. I therefore steered in a bee-line between the two manners,\nand remarked with the greatest of indifference:\n\n\"I was not aware that you expected us to be such cronies--in fact, I\nhave never given the matter a thought.\"\n\nHe turned away in a piqued style. Such a beau of beaux, no doubt he was\nannoyed that an insignificant little country bumpkin should not be\nflattered by his patronage, or probably he thought me rude or\nill-humoured.\n\nTwo mornings later uncle Jay-Jay took him to Gool-Gool _en route_ for\nSydney. When departing he bade me a kindly good-bye, made me promise to\nwrite to him, and announced his intention of obtaining the opinion of\nsome good masters re my dramatic talent and voice, when I came to Sydney\nas promised by my grandmother. I stood on the garden fence waving my\nhandkerchief until the buggy passed out of sight among the\nmessmate-trees about half a mile from the house.\n\n\"Well I hope, as that dandified ape has gone--and good riddance to\nhim--that you will pay more heed to my attentions now,\" said Mr Hawden's\nvoice, as I was in the act of descending from the fence.\n\n\"What do you mean by your attentions?\" I demanded.\n\n\"What do I mean! That is something like coming to business. I'll soon\nexplain. You know what my intentions are very well. When I am\ntwenty-four, I will come into my property in England. It is\nconsiderable, and at the end of that time I want to marry you and take\nyou home. By Jove! I would just like to take you home. You'd surprise\nsome English girls I know.\"\n\n\"There would be more than one person surprised if I married you,\" I\nthought to myself, and laughed till I ached with the motion.\n\n\"You infernal little vixen! What are you laughing at? You've got no more\nsense than a bat if such a solemn thing only provokes your mirth.\"\n\n\"Solemn--why, it's a screaming farce!\" I laughed more and more.\n\n\"What's a farce?\" he demanded fiercely.\n\n\"The bare idea of you proposing to me.\"\n\n\"Why? Have I not as much right to propose as any other man?\"\n\n\"Man!\" I laughed. \"That's where the absurdity arises. My child, if you\nwere a man, certainly you could propose, but do you think I'd look at a\nboy, a child! If ever I perpetrate matrimony the participant in my\ndegradation will be a fully developed man--not a hobbledehoy who falls\nin love, as he terms it, on an average about twice a week. Love! Ho!\"\n\nI moved in the direction of the house. He barred my path.\n\n\"You are not going to escape me like that, my fine lady. I will make you\nlisten to me this time or you will hear more about it,\" and he seized me\nangrily by the wrist.\n\nI cannot bear the touch of any one--it is one of my idiosyncrasies. With\nmy disengaged hand I struck him a vigorous blow on the nose, and\nwrenching myself free sprang away, saying, \"How dare you lay a finger on\nme! If you attempt such a thing again I'll make short work of you. Mark\nmy words, or you'll get something more than a bleeding nose next time, I\npromise you.\"\n\n\"You'll hear more of this! You'll hear more of this! You fierce, wild,\ntouch-me-not thing,\" he roared.\n\n\"Yes; my motto with men is touch-me-not, and it is your own fault if I'm\nfierce. If children attempt to act the role of a man with adult tools,\nthey are sure to cut themselves. Hold hard a bit, honey, till your\nwhiskers grow,\" I retorted as I departed, taking flying leaps over the\nblossom-burdened flower-beds.\n\nAt tea that night, after gazing interestedly at Mr Hawden's nose for\nsome time, uncle Julius inquired, \"in the name of all that's mysterious,\nwhat the devil have you been doing to your nose? You look as though you\nhad been on the spree.\"\n\nI was quaking lest he would get me into a fine scrape, but he only\nmuttered, \"By Jove!\" with great energy, and glowered menacingly across\nthe table at me.\n\nAfter tea he requested an interview with grannie, which aroused my\ncuriosity greatly. I was destined to hear all about it next morning.\nWhen breakfast was over grannie called me into her room and interviewed\nme about Mr Hawden's interview. She began without any preliminaries:\n\n\"Mr Hawden has complained of your conduct. It grieves me that any young\nman should have to speak to me of the behaviour of my own\ngrand-daughter. He says you have been flirting with him. Sybylla, I\nscarcely thought you would be so immodest and unwomanly.\"\n\nOn hearing this my thoughts of Frank Hawden were the reverse of\nflattering. He had persecuted me beyond measure, yet I had not deigned\nto complain of him to either uncle, grannie, or auntie, as I might\nreasonably have done, and have obtained immediate redress. He had been\nthe one to blame in the case, yet for the rebuffs he had brought upon\nhimself, went tattling to my grandmother.\n\n\"Is that all you have to say, grannie?\"\n\n\"No. He wants to marry you, and has asked my consent. I told him it all\nrested with yourself and parents. What do you say?\"\n\n\"Say,\" I exclaimed, \"grannie, you are only joking, are you not?\"\n\n\"No, my child, this is not a matter to joke about.\"\n\n\"Marry that creature! A boy!\" I uttered in consternation.\n\n\"He is no boy. He has attained his majority some months. He is as old as\nyour grandfather was when we married. In three years you will be almost\ntwenty, and by that time he will be in possession of his property which\nis very good--in fact, he will be quite rich. If you care for him there\nis nothing against him as I can see. He is healthy, has a good\ncharacter, and comes of a high family. Being a bit wild won't matter.\nVery often, after they sow their wild oats, some of those scampy young\nfellows settle down and marry a nice young girl and turn out very good\nhusbands.\"\n\n\"It is disgusting, and you ought to be downright ashamed of yourself,\ngrannie! A man can live a life of bestiality and then be considered a\nfit husband for the youngest and purest girl! It is shameful! Frank\nHawden is not wild, he hasn't got enough in him to be so. I hate him.\nNo, he hasn't enough in him to hate. I loathe and despise him. I would\nnot marry him or any one like him though he were King of England. The\nidea of marriage even with the best man in the world seems to me a\nlowering thing,\" I raged; \"but with him it would be pollution--the\nlowest degradation that could be heaped upon me! I will never come down\nto marry any one--\" here I fell a victim to a flood of excited tears.\n\nI felt there was no good in the world, especially in men--the hateful\ncreatures!--and never would be while it was not expected of them, even\nby rigidly pure, true Christians such as my grandmother. Grannie, dear\nold grannie, thought I should marry any man who, from a financial point\nof view, was a good match for me. That is where the sting came in. No, I\nwould never marry. I would procure some occupation in which I could\ntread my life out, independent of the degradation of marriage.\n\n\"Dear me, child,\" said grannie, concernedly, \"there is no need to\ndistress yourself so. I remember you were always fearfully passionate.\nWhen I had you with me as a tiny toddler, you would fret a whole day\nabout a thing an ordinary child would forget inside an hour. I will tell\nHawden to go about his business. I would not want you to consider\nmarriage for an instant with anyone distasteful to you. But tell me\ntruly, have you ever flirted with him? I will take your word, for I\nthank God you have never yet told me a falsehood!\"\n\n\"Grannie,\" I exclaimed emphatically, \"I have discouraged him all I\ncould. I would scorn to flirt with any man.\"\n\n\"Well, well, that is all I want to hear about it. Wash your eyes, and we\nwill get our horses and go over to see Mrs Hickey and her baby, and take\nher something good to eat.\"\n\nI did not encounter Frank Hawden again till the afternoon, when he\nleered at me in a very triumphant manner. I stiffened myself and drew\nout of his way as though he had been some vile animal. At this treatment\nhe whined, so I agreed to talk the matter over with him and have done\nwith it once and for all.\n\nHe was on his way to water some dogs, so I accompanied him out to the\nstables near the kennels, to be out of hearing of the household.\n\nI opened fire without any beating about the bush.\n\n\"I ask you, Mr Hawden, if you have any sense of manliness, from this\nhour to cease persecuting me with your idiotic professions of love. I\nhave two sentiments regarding it, and in either you disgust me.\nSometimes I don't believe there is such a thing as love at all--that is,\nlove between men and women. While in this frame of mind I would not\nlisten to professions of love from an angel. Other times I believe in\nlove, and look upon it as a sacred and solemn thing. When in that\nhumour, it seems to me a desecration to hear you twaddling about the\nholy theme, for you are only a boy, and don't know how to feel. I would\nnot have spoken thus harshly to you, but by your unmanly conduct you\nhave brought it upon yourself. I have told you straight all that I will\never deign to tell you on the subject, and take much pleasure in wishing\nyou good afternoon.\"\n\nI walked away quickly, heedless of his expostulations.\n\nMy appeal to his manliness had no effect. Did I go for a ride, or a walk\nin the afternoon to enjoy the glory of the sunset, or a stroll to drink\nin the pleasures of the old garden, there would I find Frank Hawden by\nmy side, yah, yah, yahing about the way I treated him, until I wished\nhim at the bottom of the Red Sea.\n\nHowever, in those glorious spring days the sense of life was too\npleasant to be much clouded by the trifling annoyance Frank Hawden\noccasioned me. The graceful wild clematis festooned the shrubbery along\nthe creeks with great wreaths of magnificent white bloom, which loaded\nevery breeze with perfume; the pretty bright green senna shrubs along\nthe river-banks were decked in blossoms which rivalled the deep blue of\nthe sky in brilliance; the magpies built their nests in the tall\ngum-trees, and savagely attacked unwary travellers who ventured too near\ntheir domain; the horses were rolling fat, and invited one to get on\ntheir satin backs and have a gallop; the cry of the leather-heads was\nheard in the orchard as the cherry season approached. Oh, it was good to\nbe alive!\n\nAt Caddagat I was as much out of the full flood of life for which I\ncraved as at Possum Gully, but here there were sufficient pleasant\nlittle ripples on the stream of existence to act as a stop-gap for the\npresent.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THIRTEEN\n\nHe\n\n\nHere goes for a full account of my first, my last, my only _real_\nsweetheart, for I considered the professions of that pestiferous\njackeroo as merely a grotesque caricature on the genuine article.\n\nOn making my first appearance before my lover, I looked quite the\nreverse of a heroine. My lovely hair was not conveniently escaping from\nthe comb at the right moment to catch him hard in the eye, neither was\nmy thrillingly low sweet voice floating out on the scented air in a\nmanner which went straight to his heart, like the girls I had read of.\nOn the contrary, I much resembled a female clown. It was on a day\ntowards the end of September, and I had been up the creek making a\ncollection of ferns. I had on a pair of men's boots with which to walk\nin the water, and was garbed in a most dilapidated old dress, which I\nhad borrowed from one of the servants for the purpose. A pair of gloves\nmade of basil, and a big hat, much torn in struggling through the\nundergrowth, completed my make-up. My hair was most unbecomingly screwed\nup, the short ends sticking out like a hurrah's nest.\n\nIt was late in the day when, returning from my ramble, I was met on the\ndoorstep by aunt Helen.\n\n\"While you are in that trim, I wish you would pluck some lemons for me.\nI'm sure there is no danger of you ruining your turn-out. A sketch of\nyou would make a good item for the _Bulletin_,\" she said.\n\nI went readily to do her bidding, and fetching a ladder with rungs about\ntwo feet six apart, placed it against a lemon-tree at the back of the\nhouse, and climbed up.\n\nHolding a number of lemons in my skirt, I was making a most ungraceful\ndescent, when I heard an unknown footstep approaching towards my back.\n\nPeople came to Caddagat at all hours of the day, so I was not in the\nleast disconcerted. Only a tramp, an agent, or a hawker, I bet, I\nthought, as I reached my big boot down for another rung of the ladder\nwithout turning my head to see whom it might be.\n\nA pair of strong brown hands encircled my waist, I was tossed up a foot\nor so and then deposited lightly on the ground, a masculine voice\nsaying, \"You're a mighty well-shaped young filly--'a waist rather small,\nbut a quarter superb'.\"\n\n\"How dare anyone speak to me like that,\" I thought, as I faced about to\nsee who was parodying Gordon. There stood a man I had never before set\neyes on, smiling mischievously at me. He was a young man--a very young\nman, a bushman tremendously tall and big and sunburnt, with an open\npleasant face and chestnut moustache--not at all an awe-inspiring\nfellow, in spite of his unusual, though well-proportioned and carried,\nheight. I knew it must be Harold Beecham, of Five-Bob Downs, as I had\nheard he stood six feet three and a half in his socks.\n\nI hurriedly let down my dress, the lemons rolling in a dozen directions,\nand turned to flee, but that well-formed figure bounded before me with\nthe agility of a cat and barred my way.\n\n\"Now, not a step do you go, my fine young blood, until you pick up every\njolly lemon and put them away tidily, or I'll tell the missus on you as\nsure as eggs.\"\n\nIt dawned on me that he had mistaken me for one of the servant-girls.\nThat wasn't bad fun. I determined not to undeceive but to have a lark\nwith him. I summed him up as conceited, but not with the disgusting\nconceit with which some are afflicted, or perhaps blessed. It was rather\nan air of\nI-have-always-got-what-I-desire-and-believe,-if-people-fail-it-is-all-their-own-fault,\nwhich surrounded him.\n\n\"If you please, sir,\" I said humbly, \"I've gathered them all up, will\nyou let me go now.\"\n\n\"Yes, when you've given me a kiss.\"\n\n\"Oh, sir, I couldn't do that!\"\n\n\"Go on, I won't poison you. Come now, I'll make you.\"\n\n\"Oh, the missus might catch me.\"\n\n\"No jolly fear; I'll take all the blame if she does.\"\n\n\"Oh don't, sir; let me go, please,\" I said in such unfeigned distress,\nfor I feared he was going to execute his threat, that he laughed and\nsaid:\n\n\"Don't be frightened, sissy, I never kiss girls, and I'm not going to\nstart at this time of day, and against their will to boot. You haven't\nbeen long here, have you? I haven't seen you before. Stand out there\ntill I see if you've got any grit in you, and then I am done with you.\"\n\nI stood in the middle of the yard, the spot he indicated, while he\nuncurled his long heavy stock-whip with its big lash and scented myall\nhandle. He cracked it round and round my head and arms, but I did not\nfeel the least afraid, as I saw at a glance that he was exceedingly\ndexterous in the bushman's art of handling a stock-whip, and knew, if I\nkept perfectly still, I was quite safe. It was thanks to uncle Jay-Jay\nthat I was able to bear the operation with unruffled equanimity, as he\nwas in the habit of testing my nerves in this way.\n\n\"Well, I never! Not so much as blinked an eyelash! Thoroughbred!\" He\nsaid after a minute or so, \"Where's the boss?\"\n\n\"In Gool-Gool. He won't be home till late.\"\n\n\"Is Mrs Bossier in?\"\n\n\"No, she's not, but Mrs Bell is somewhere around in front.\"\n\n\"Thanks.\"\n\nI watched him as he walked away with an easy swinging stride, which\nspoke of many long, long days in the saddle. I felt certain as I watched\nhim that he had quite forgotten the incident of the little girl with the\nlemons.\n\n\n\n\"Sybylla, hurry up and get dressed. Put on your best bib and tucker, and\nI will leave Harry Beecham in your charge, as I want to superintend the\nmaking of some of the dishes myself this evening.\"\n\n\"It's too early to put on my evening dress, isn't it, auntie?\n\n\"It is rather early; but you can't spare time to change twice. Dress\nyourself completely; you don't know what minute your uncle and his\nworship will arrive.\"\n\nI had taken a dip in the creek, so had not to bathe, and it took me but\na short time to don full war-paint--blue evening dress, satin slippers,\nand all. I wore my hair flowing, simply tied with a ribbon. I slipped\nout into the passage and called aunt Helen. She came.\n\n\"I'm ready, auntie. Where is he?\"\n\n\"In the dining-room.\"\n\n\"Come into the drawing-room and call him. I will take charge of him till\nyou are at leisure. But, auntie, it will be a long time till dinner--how\non earth will I manage him?\"\n\n\"Manage him!\" she laughed; \"he is not at all an obstreperous character.\"\n\nWe had reached the drawing-room by this, and I looked at myself in the\nlooking-glass while aunt Helen went to summon Harold Augustus Beecham,\nbachelor, owner of Five-Bob Downs, Wyambeet, Wallerawang West,\nQuat-Quatta, and a couple more stations in New South Wales, besides an\nextensive one in Queensland.\n\nI noticed as he entered the door that since I had seen him he had\nwashed, combed his stiff black hair, and divested himself of his hat,\nspurs, and whip--his leggings had perforce to remain, as his nether\ngarment was a pair of closely fitting grey cloth riding-breeches, which\nclearly defined the shapely contour of his lower limbs.\n\n\"Harry, this is Sybylla. I'm sure you need no further introduction.\nExcuse me, I have something on the fire which is likely to burn.\" And\naunt Helen hurried off leaving us facing each other.\n\nHe stared down at me with undisguised surprise. I looked up at him and\nlaughed merrily. The fun was all on my side. He was a great big\nman--rich and important. I was a chit--an insignificant nonentity--yet,\ndespite his sex, size, and importance, I was complete master of that\nsituation, and knew it: thus I laughed.\n\nI saw that he recognized me again by the dusky red he flushed beneath\nhis sun-darkened skin. No doubt he regretted having called me a filly\nabove all things. He bowed stiffly, but I held out my hand, saying:\n\n\"Do shake hands. When introduced I always shake hands with anyone I\nthink I'll like. Besides, I seem to know you well. Just think of all the\napples you brought me!\"\n\nHe acceded to my request, holding my hand a deal longer than necessary,\nand looking at me helplessly. It amused me greatly, for I saw that it\nwas he who did not know how to manage me, and not I that couldn't manage\nhim.\n\n\"'Pon my honour, Miss Melvyn, I had no idea it was you, when I said--\"\nHere he boggled completely, which had the effect of reviving my\nlaughter.\n\n\"You had no right to be dressed like that--deceiving a fellow. It wasn't\nfair.\"\n\n\"That's the best of it. It shows what a larrikin Don Juan sort of\ncharacter you are. You can't deceive me now if you pretend to be a\nvirtuous well-behaved member of society.\"\n\n\"That is the first time I've ever meddled with any of the kitchen fry,\nand, by Jove, it will be the last!\" he said energetically. \"I've got\nmyself into a pretty mess.\"\n\n\"What nonsense you talk,\" I replied. \"If you say another word about it,\nI'll write a full account of it and paste it in my scrapbook. But if you\ndon't worry about it, neither will I. You said nothing very\nuncomplimentary; in fact, I was quite flattered.\"\n\nI was perched on the high end of a couch, and he was leaning with big\ncareless ease on the piano. Had grannie seen me, I would have been\nlectured about unladylike behaviour.\n\n\n\"What is your uncle at today?\" he inquired.\n\n\"He's not at anything. He went to Gool-Gool yesterday on the jury. Court\nfinishes up today, and he is going to bring the judge home tonight.\nThat's why I am dressed so carefully,\" I answered.\n\n\"Good gracious! I never thought of court this time as I wasn't called on\nthe jury, and for a wonder hadn't so much as a case against a Chinaman.\nI was going to stay tonight, but can't if his worship is going to dine\nhere.\"\n\n\"Why? You're surely not afraid of Judge Fossilt? He's a very simple old\ncustomer.\"\n\n\"Imagine dining with a judge in this toggery!\" and he glanced down his\ngreat figure at his riding gear.\n\n\"That doesn't matter; he's near-sighted. I'll get you put at the far end\nof the table under my wing. Men don't notice dress. If you weren't so\nbig uncle or Frank Hawden could oblige you.\"\n\n\"Do you think I could pass muster?\"\n\n\"Yes; after I brush you down you'll look as spruce as a brass penny.\n\n\"I did brush myself,\" he answered.\n\n\"You brush yourself!\" I retorted. \"There's a big splash of mud on your\nshoulder. You couldn't expect to do anything decently, for you're only a\nman, and men are the uselessest, good-for-nothingest, clumsiest animals\nin the world. All they're good for is to smoke and swear.\"\n\nI fetched a clothes brush.\n\n\"You'll have to stand on the table to reach me,\" he said, looking down\nwith amused indulgence.\n\n\"As you are so impertinent you can go dusty,\" and I tossed the brush\naway.\n\nThe evening was balmy, so I invited him into the garden. He threw his\nhandkerchief over my chest, saying I might catch cold, but I scouted the\nidea.\n\nWe wandered into an arbour covered with wistaria, banksia, and Marechal\nNiel roses, and I made him a buttonhole.\n\nA traveller pulled rein in the roadway, and, dismounting, threw his\nbridle over a paling of the garden fence while he went inside to try and\nbuy a loaf of bread.\n\nI jumped up, frightening the horse so that it broke away, pulling off\nthe paling in the bridle-rein. I ran to bring a hammer to repair the\ndamage. Mr Beecham caught the horse while I attempted to drive the nail\ninto the fence. It was a futile attempt. I bruised my fingers. He took\nthe hammer from me, and fixing the paling in its place with a couple of\nwell-aimed blows, said laughingly:\n\n\"You drive a nail! You couldn't expect to do anything. You're only a\ngirl. Girls are the helplessest, uselessest, troublesomest little\ncreatures in the world. All they're good for is to torment and pester a\nfellow.\"\n\nI had to laugh.\n\nAt this juncture we heard uncle Jay-Jay's voice, so Mr Beecham went\ntowards the back, whence it proceeded, after he left me at the front\ndoor.\n\n\"Oh, auntie, we got on splendidly! He's not a bit of trouble. We're as\nchummy as though we had been reared together,\" I exclaimed.\n\n\"Did you get him to talk?\"\n\n\"Oh yes.\"\n\n\"Did you really?\" in surprise.\n\nWhen I came to review the matter I was forced to confess that I had done\nall the talking, and young Beecham the listening; moreover I described\nhim as the quietest man I had ever seen or heard of.\n\nThe judge did not come home with uncle Jay-Jay as expected so it was not\nnecessary for me to shelter Harold Beecham under my wing. Grannie\ngreeted him cordially as \"Harold, my boy\", he was a great favourite with\nher. She and uncle Julius monopolized him for the evening. There was\ngreat talk of trucking sheep, the bad outlook as regarded the season,\nthe state of the grass in the triangle, the Leigh Spring, the Bimbalong,\nand several other paddocks, and of the condition of the London wool\nmarket. It did not interest me, so I dived into a book, only\noccasionally emerging therefrom to smile at Mr Beecham.\n\nHe had come to Caddagat for a pair of bullocks which had been fattening\nin grannie's home paddock. Uncle gave him a start with them next\nmorning. When they came out on the road I was standing in a bed of\nviolets in a tangled corner of the garden, where roses climbed to kiss\nthe lilacs, and spiraea stooped to rest upon the wallflowers, and where\ntwo tall kurrajongs stood like sentries over all. Harold Beecham\ndismounted, and, leaning over the fence, lingered with me, leaving the\nbullocks to uncle Jay-Jay. Uncle raved vigorously. Women, he asserted,\nwere the bane of society and the ruination of all men; but he had always\nconsidered Harold as too sensible to neglect his business to stand\ngrinning at a pesky youngster in short skirts and a pigtail. Which was\nthe greatest idiot of the two he didn't know.\n\nHis grumbling did not affect Harold in the least.\n\n\"Complimentary to both of us,\" he remarked as he leisurely threw himself\nacross his great horse, and smiled his pleasant quiet smile, disclosing\ntwo rows of magnificent teeth, untainted by contamination with beer or\ntobacco. Raising his panama hat with the green fly-veil around it, he\ncantered off. I wondered as I watched him if anything ever disturbed his\nserenity, and desired to try. He looked too big and quiet to be ruffled\nby such emotions as rage, worry, jealousy, or even love. Returning to\nthe house, I put aunt Helen through an exhaustive catechism concerning\nhim.\n\n_Question._ Auntie, what age is Harold Beecham?\n\n_Answer._ Twenty-five last December.\n\n_Q._ Did he ever have any brothers or sisters?\n\n_A._ No. His birth caused his mother's death. Q. How long has his father\nbeen dead?\n\n_A._ Since Harold could crawl.\n\n_Q._ Who reared him?\n\nA. His aunts.\n\n_Q._ Does he ever talk any more than that? A. Often a great deal less.\n\n_Q._ Is he really very rich?\n\n_A._ If he manages to pull through these seasons he will be second to\nnone but Tyson in point of wealth.\n\n_Q._ Is Five-Bob a very pretty place?\n\n_A._ Yes; one of the show places of the district. Q. Does he often come\nto Caddagat?\n\n_A._ Yes, he often drops in.\n\n_Q._ What makes his hair so black and his moustache that light colour?\n\nA. You'll have to study science to find that out. I'm sure I can't tell\nyou.\n\n_Q._ Does he--?\n\n\"Now, Sybylla,\" said auntie, laughing, \"you are taking a suspicious\ninterest in my sunburnt young giant. Did I not tell you he was taking\ntime by the forelock when he brought the apples?\"\n\n\"Oh, auntie, I am only asking questions because--\"\n\n\"Yes, because, because, I understand perfectly. Because you are a girl,\nand all the girls fall a victim to Harry's charms at once. If you don't\nwant to succumb meekly to your fate, 'Heed the spark or you may dread\nthe fire.' That is the only advice I can tender you.\"\n\nThis was a Thursday, and on the following Sunday Harold Beecham\nreappeared at Caddagat and remained from three in the afternoon until\nnine at night. Uncle Julius and Frank Hawden were absent. The weather\nhad taken a sudden backward lurch into winter again, so we had a fire.\nHarold sat beside it all the time, and interposed yes and no at the\nproper intervals in grannie's brisk business conversation, but he never\naddressed one word to me beyond \"Good afternoon, Miss Melvyn,\" on his\narrival, and \"Good night, Miss Melvyn,\" when leaving.\n\nI studied him attentively all the while. What were his ideas and\nsentiments it were hard to tell: he never expressed any. He was\nfearfully and wonderfully quiet. Yet his was an intelligent silence, not\nof that wooden brainless description which casts a damper on company,\nneither was it of the morose or dreaming order.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER FOURTEEN\n\nPrincipally Letters\n\n\nCaddagat, 29th Sept., 1896\n\nMy dearest Gertie,\n\nI have started to write no less than seven letters to you, but something\nalways interrupted me and I did not finish them. However, I'll finish\nthis one in the teeth of Father Peter himself. I will parenthesize all\nthe interruptions. (A traveller just asked me for a rose. I had to get\nup and give him one.) Living here is lovely. (Another man inquired the\nway to Somingley Gap, and I've just finished directing him.) Grannie is\nterribly nice. You could not believe. She is always giving me something,\nand takes me wherever she goes. Auntie is an angel. I wish you could\nhear the piano. It is a beauty. There are dozens of papers and books to\nread. Uncle is a dear old fellow. You should hear him rave and swear\nsometimes when he gets in a rage. It is great fun. He brings me lollies,\ngloves, ribbons, or something every time he comes from town. (Two Indian\nhawkers have arrived, and I am going out to see their goods. There were\nnineteen hawkers here last week. I am sitting on a squatter's chair and\nwriting on a table in the veranda, and the road goes right by the\nflower-garden. That is how I see everyone.) Have you had rain down there\nthis week? They have great squawking about the drought up here. I wish\nthey could see Goulburn, and then they'd know what drought means. I\ndon't know what sort of a bobberie they would kick up. It's pretty dry\nout on the run, but everyone calls the paddocks about the house an\noasis. You see there are such splendid facilities for irrigation here.\nUncle has put on a lot of men. They have cut races between the two\ncreeks between which the house is situated. Every now and again they let\nthe water from these over the orchard gardens and about a hundred acres\nof paddock land around the house. The grass therein is up to the horses'\nfetlocks. There is any amount of rhubarb and early vegetables in the\ngarden. Grannie says there is a splendid promise of fruit in the\norchard, and the flower-garden is a perfect dream. This is the dearest\nold place in the world. Dozens of people plague grannie to be let put\ntheir horses in the grass--especially shearers, there are droves of them\ngoing home now--but she won't let them; wants all the grass for her own\nstock. Uncle has had to put another man on to mind it, or at night all\nthe wires are cut and the horses put in. (An agent, I think by the cut\nof him, is asking for grannie. I'll have to run and find her.) It is\nvery lively here. Never a night but we have the house full of agents or\ntravellers of one sort or another, and there are often a dozen swaggies\nin the one day.\n\nHarold Beecham is my favourite of all the men hereaway. He is\ndelightfully big and quiet. He isn't good-looking, but I like his face.\n(Been attending to the demands of a couple of impudent swaggies. Being\noff the road at Possum Gully, you escape them.) For the love of life,\nnext time you write, fire into the news at once and don't half-fill your\nletter telling me about the pen and your bad writing. I am scribbling at\nthe rate of 365 miles an hour, and don't care a jot whether it is good\nwriting or not.\n\nAuntie, uncle, Frank Hawden and I, are going to ride to Yabtree church\nnext Sunday. It is four miles beyond Five-Bob Downs, so that is sixteen\nmiles. It is the nearest church. I expect it will be rare fun. There\nwill be such a crowd coming home, and that always makes the horses\ndelightfully frisky. (A man wants to put his horses in the paddock for\nthe night, so I will have to find uncle.) I never saw such a place for\nmen. It is all men, men, men. You cannot go anywhere outside the house\nbut you see men coming and going in all directions. It wouldn't do to\nundress without bothering to drop the window-blind like we used at\nPossum Gully. Grannie and uncle say it is a curse to be living beside\nthe road, as it costs them a tremendous lot a year. There are seven\nlemon-trees here, loaded (another hawker). I hope you think of me\nsometimes. I am just as ugly as ever. (A traveller wants to buy a loaf\nof bread.)\n\nWith stacks of love to all at home, and a whole dray-load for yourself,\nfrom your loving sister,\n\nSybylla.\n\n\nRemember me to Goulburn, drowsing lazily in its dreamy graceful hollow\nin the blue distance.\n\n\nCaddagat, 29th Sept., 1896\n\nDear Everard,\n\nThank you very much for the magazines and \"An Australian Bush Track\". I\nsuppose you have quite forgotten us and Caddagat by this time. The sun\nhas sunk behind the gum-trees, and the blue evening mists are hanging\nlazily in the hollows of the hills. I expect you are donning your\n\"swallow-tail\" preparatory to leading some be-satined \"faire ladye\" in\nto a gorgeous dinner, thence to the play, then to a dance probably. No\ndoubt all around you is bustle, glare of lights, noise, and fun. It is\nsuch a different scene here. From down the road comes the tinkle of\ncamp-bells and jingle of hobble-chains. From down in that sheltered\nangle where the creek meets the river comes the gleam of camp-fires\nthrough the gathering twilight, and I can see several tents rigged for\nthe night, looking like white specks in the distance.\n\nI long for the time to come when I shall get to Sydney. I'm going to\nlead you and aunt Helen a pretty dance. You'll have to keep going night\nand day. It will be great. I must get up and dance a jig on the veranda\nwhen I think of it. You'll have to show me everything--slums and all. I\nwant to find out the truth of heaps of things for myself.\n\nSave for the weird rush of the stream and the kookaburras' good-night,\nall is still, with a mighty far-reaching stillness which can be felt.\nNow the curlews are beginning their wild moaning cry. From the rifts in\nthe dark lone ranges, far down the river, it comes like a hunted spirit\nuntil it makes me feel--\n\n\nAt this point I said, \"Bah! I'm mad to write to Everard Grey like this.\nHe would laugh and call me a poor little fool.\" I tore the half-finished\nletter to shreds, and consigned it to the kitchen fire. I substituted a\nprim formal note, merely thanking him for the books and magazine he had\nsent me. To this I never received an answer. I heard through his letters\nto grannie that he was much occupied. Had been to Brisbane and Melbourne\non important cases, so very likely had not time to be bothered with me;\nor, he might have been like the majority of his fellows who make a great\nparade of friendship while with one, then go away and forget one's\nexistence in an hour.\n\nWhile at Caddagat there were a few duties allotted to me. One of these\nwas to attend to the drawing-room; another was to find uncle Jay-Jay's\nhat when he mislaid it--often ten times per day. I assisted my\ngrandmother to make up her accounts and write business letters, and I\nattended to tramps. A man was never refused a bit to eat at Caddagat.\nThis necessitated the purchase of an extra ton of flour per year, also\nnearly a ton of sugar, to say nothing of tea, potatoes, beef, and all\nbroken meats which went thus. This was not reckoning the consumption of\nvictuals by the other class of travellers with which the house was\ngenerally full year in and year out. Had there been any charge for their\nboard and lodging, the Bossiers would surely have made a fortune. I\ninterviewed on an average fifty tramps a week, and seldom saw the same\nman twice. What a great army they were! Hopeless, homeless, aimless,\nshameless souls, tramping on from north to south, and east to west,\nnever relinquishing their heart-sickening, futile quest for work--some\nof them so long on the tramp that the ambitions of manhood had been\nground out of them, and they wished for nothing more than this.\n\nThere were all shapes, sizes, ages, kinds, and conditions of men--the\nshamefaced boy in the bud of his youth, showing by the way he begged\nthat the humiliation of the situation had not yet worn off, and poor old\ncreatures tottering on the brink of the grave, with nothing left in life\nbut the enjoyment of beer and tobacco. There were strong men in their\nprime who really desired work when they asked for it, and skulking\ncowards who hoped they would not get it. There were the diseased, the\neducated, the ignorant, the deformed, the blind, the evil, the honest,\nthe mad, and the sane. Some in real professional beggars' style called\ndown blessings on me; others were morose and glum, while some were\nimpudent and thankless, and said to supply them with food was just what\nI should do, for the swagmen kept the squatters--as, had the squatters\nnot monopolized the land, the swagmen would have had plenty. A moiety of\nthe last-mentioned--dirty, besotted, ragged creatures--had a glare in\ntheir eyes which made one shudder to look at them, and, while\nspasmodically twirling their billies or clenching their fists, talked\nwildly of making one to \"bust up the damn banks\", or to drive all the\npresent squatters out of the country and put the people on the\nland--clearly showing that, because they had failed for one reason or\nanother, it had maddened them to see others succeed.\n\nIn a wide young country of boundless resources, why is this thing? This\nquestion worried me. Our legislators are unable or unwilling to cope\nwith it. They trouble not to be patriots and statesmen. Australia can\nbring forth writers, orators, financiers, singers, musicians, actors,\nand athletes which are second to none of any nation under the sun. Why\ncan she not bear sons, men of soul, mind, truth, godliness, and\npatriotism sufficient to rise and cast off the grim shackles which widen\nround us day by day?\n\nI was the only one at Caddagat who held these silly ideas. Harold\nBeecham, uncle Julius, grannie, and Frank Hawden did not worry about the\ncause of tramps. They simply termed them a lazy lot of sneaking\ncreatures, fed them, and thought no more of the matter.\n\nI broached the subject to uncle Jay-Jay once, simply to discover his\nideas thereon.\n\nI was sitting on a chair in the veranda sewing; he, with his head on a\ncushion, was comfortably stretched on a rug on the floor.\n\n\"Uncle Boss, why can't something be done for tramps?\"\n\n\"How done for 'em?\"\n\n\"Couldn't some means of employing them be arrived at?\"\n\n\"Work!\" he ejaculated. \"That's the very thing the crawling divils are\nterrified they might get.\"\n\n\"Yes; but couldn't some law be made to help them?\"\n\n\"A law to make me cut up Caddagat and give ten of 'em each a piece, and\ngo on the wallaby myself, I suppose?\"\n\n\"No, uncle; but there was a poor young fellow here this morning who, I\nfeel sure, was in earnest when he asked for work.\"\n\n\"Helen!\" bawled uncle Jay-Jay.\n\n\"Well, what is it?\" she inquired, appearing in the doorway.\n\n\"Next time Sybylla is giving a tramp some tucker, you keep a sharp eye\non her or she will be sloping one of these days. There was a young\nfellow here today with a scarlet moustache and green eyes, and she's\ndean gone on him, and has been bullying me to give him half Caddagat.\"\n\n\"What a disgusting thing to say! Uncle, you ought to be ashamed of\nyourself,\" I exclaimed.\n\n\"Very well, I'll be careful,\" said aunt Helen, departing.\n\n\"What with the damned flies, and the tramps, and a pesky thing called\nSybylla, a man's life ain't worth a penny to him,\" said uncle.\n\nWe fell into silence, which was broken presently by a dirty red-bearded\nface appearing over the garden gate, and a man's voice:\n\n\"Good day, boss! Give us a chew of tobaccer?\"\n\n\"I'm not the boss,\" said uncle with assumed fierceness.\n\n\"Then who is?\" inquired the man.\n\nUncle pointed his thumb at me, and, rolling out on the floor again as\nthough very sleepy, began to snore. The tramp grinned, and made his\nrequest of me. I took him round to the back, served him with flour,\nbeef, and an inch or two of rank tobacco out of a keg which had been\nbought for the purpose. Refusing a drink of milk which I offered, he\nresumed his endless tramp with a \"So long, little missy. God bless your\npleasant face.\"\n\nI watched him out of sight. One of my brothers--one of God's children\nunder the Southern Cross. Did these old fellows really believe in the\nGod whose name they mentioned so glibly? I wondered. But I am thankful\nthat while at Caddagat it was only rarely that my old top-heavy thoughts\ntroubled me. Life was so pleasant that I was content merely to be\nyoung--a chit in the first flush of teens, health, hope, happiness,\nyouth--a heedless creature recking not for the morrow.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER FIFTEEN\n\nWhen the Heart is Young\n\n\nAbout a week or so after I first met Harold Beecham, aunt Helen allowed\nme to read a letter she had received from the elder of the two Misses\nBeecham. It ran as follows:\n\n\n\"My dearest Helen,\n\n\"This is a begging letter, and I am writing another to your mother at\nthe same time. I am asking her to allow her grand-daughter to spend a\nfew weeks with me, and I want you to use your influence in the matter.\nSarah has not been well lately, and is going to Melbourne for a change,\nand as I will be lonely while she is away Harold insists upon me having\nsomeone to keep me company--you know how considerate the dear boy is. I\nhardly like to ask you to spare your little girl to me. It must be a\ngreat comfort to have her. I could have got Miss Benson to stay with me,\nbut Harold will not hear of her. He says she is too slow, and would give\nus both the mopes. But he says your little niece will keep us all alive.\nJulius was telling me the other day that he could not part with her, as\nshe makes 'the old barracks', as he always calls Caddagat, echo with fun\nand noise. I am so looking forward to seeing her, as she is dear Lucy's\nchild. Give her my love,\" etc., etc., and as a postscript the letter\nhad--\"Harold will go up for Sybylla on Wednesday afternoon. I do hope\nyou will be able to spare her to me for a while.\"\n\n\n\"Oh, auntie, how lovely!\" I exclaimed. \"What are you laughing at?\"\n\n\"For whom do you think Harry wants the companion? It is nice to have an\nold auntie, as a blind, is it not? Well, all is fair in love and war.\nYou have permission to use me in any way you like.\"\n\nI pretended to miss her meaning.\n\nGrannie consented to Miss Beecham's proposal, and ere the day arrived I\nhad a trunk packed with some lovely new dresses, and was looking forward\nwith great glee to my visit to Five-Bob Downs.\n\nOne o'clock on Wednesday afternoon arrived; two o'clock struck, and I\nwas beginning to fear no one was coming for me, when, turning to look\nout the window for the eighteenth time, I saw the straight blunt nose of\nHarold Beecham passing. Grannie was serving afternoon tea on the\nveranda. I did not want any, so got ready while my escort was having\nhis.\n\nIt was rather late when we bowled away at a tremendous pace in a red\nsulky, my portmanteau strapped on at the back, and a thoroughbred\nAmerican trotter, which had taken prizes at Sydney shows, harnessed to\nthe front. We just whizzed! It was splendid! The stones and dust rose in\na thick cloud from the whirling wheels and flying hoofs, and the posts\nof the wire fence on our left passed like magic as we went. Mr Beecham\nallowed me to drive after a time while he sat ready to take the reins\nshould an emergency arise.\n\nIt was sunset--most majestic hour of the twenty-four--when we drove up\nto the great white gates which opened into the avenue leading to the\nmain homestead of Five-Bob Downs station--beautiful far-reaching\nFive-Bob Downs! Dreamy blue hills rose behind, and wide rich flats\nstretched before, through which the Yarrangung river, glazed with\nsunset, could be seen like a silver snake winding between shrubberied\nbanks. The odour from the six-acred flower-garden was overpowering and\ndelightful. A breeze gently swayed the crowd of trees amid the houses,\nand swept over the great orchard which sloped down from the south side\nof the houses. In the fading sunlight thirty iron roofs gleamed and\nglared, and seemed like a little town; and the yelp of many dogs went up\nat the sound of our wheels. Ah! beautiful, beautiful Five-Bob Downs!\n\nIt seemed as though a hundred dogs leapt forth to greet us when that\ngate flew open, but I subsequently discovered there were but\ntwenty-three.\n\nTwo female figures came out to meet us--one nearly six feet high, the\nother, a tiny creature, seemed about eighteen inches, though, of course,\nwas more than that.\n\n\"I've brought her, aunt Gussie,\" said Harold, jumping out of the sulky,\nthough not relinquishing the reins, while he kissed the taller figure,\nand the small one attached itself to his leg saying, \"Dimme wide.\"\n\n\"Hullo! Possum, why wasn't old Spanker let go? I see he's not among the\ndogs,\" and my host picked the tiny individual up in his arms and got\ninto the sulky to give her the desired ride, while after being embraced\nby Miss Beecham and lifted to the ground by her nephew, I went with the\nformer over an asphalted tennis-court, through the wide garden, then\nacross a broad veranda into the great, spreading, one-storeyed house\nfrom which gleamed many lights.\n\n\"I am so glad you have come, my dear. I must have a good look at you\nwhen we get into the light. I hope you are like your mother.\"\n\nThis prospect discomfited me. I knew she would find a very ugly girl\nwith not the least resemblance to her pretty mother, and I cursed my\nappearance under my breath.\n\n\"Your name is Sybylla,\" Miss Beecham continued, \"Sybylla Penelope. Your\nmother used to be very dear to me, but I don't know why she doesn't\nwrite to me now. I have never seen her since her marriage. It seems\nstrange to think of her as the mother of eight--five boys and three\ngirls, is it not?\"\n\nMiss Beecham had piloted me through a wide hall and along an extended\npassage out of which a row of bedrooms opened, into one of which we\nwent.\n\n\"I hope you will be comfortable here, child. You need not dress for\ndinner while you are here; we never do, only on very special occasions.\"\n\n\"Neither do we at Caddagat,\" I replied.\n\n\"Now, child, let me have a good look at you without your hat.\"\n\n\"Oh, please don't!\" I exclaimed, covering my face with my hands. \"I am\nso dreadfully ugly that I cannot bear to have anyone look at me.\"\n\n\"What a silly little girl! You are not like your mother, but you are not\nat all plain-looking. Harold says you are the best style of girl he has\nseen yet, and sing beautifully. He got a tuner up from Sydney last week,\nso we will expect you to entertain us every night.\"\n\nI learnt that what Harold pronounced good no one dared gainsay at\nFive-Bob Downs.\n\nWe proceeded direct to the dining-room, and had not been there long when\nMr Beecham entered with the little girl on his shoulder. Miss Beecham\nhad told me she was Minnie Benson, daughter of Harold's married overseer\non Wyambeet, his adjoining station. Miss Beecham considered it would\nhave been more seemly for her nephew to have selected a little boy as a\nplay-thing, but his sentiments regarding boys were that they were\nmachines invented for the torment of adults.\n\n\"Well, O'Doolan, what sort of a day has it been?\" Harold inquired,\nsetting his human toy upon the floor.\n\n\"Fine wezzer for yim duts,\" she promptly replied.\n\n\"Harold, it is shameful to teach a little innocent child such abominable\nslang; and you might give her a decent nickname,\" said Miss Beecham.\n\n\"O'Doolan, this is Miss Melvyn, and you have to do the same to her as\nyou do to me.\"\n\nThe little thing held out her arms to me. I took her up, and she hugged\nand kissed me, saying:\n\n\"I luz oo, I luz oo,\" and turning to Mr Beecham, \"zat anuff?\n\n\"Yes, that will do,\" he said; and she struggled to be put down.\n\nThree jackeroos, an overseer, and two other young men came in, were\nintroduced to me, and then we began dinner.\n\nO'Doolan sat on a high chair beside Mr Beecham, and he attended to all\nher wants. She did everything he did, even taking mustard, and was very\nbrave at quelling the tears that rose to the doll-like blue eyes. When\nMr Beecham wiped his moustache, it was amusing to see her also wipe an\nimaginary one.\n\nAfter dinner the jackeroos and the three other men repaired to a\nsitting-room in the backyard, which was specially set apart for them,\nand where they amused themselves as they liked. My host and hostess,\nmyself, and the child, spent the evening in a tiny sitting-room\nadjoining the dining-room. Miss Beecham entertained me with conversation\nand the family albums, and Harold amused himself entirely with the\nchild.\n\nOnce when they were absent for a few minutes, Miss Beecham told me it\nwas ridiculous the way he fussed with the child, and that he had her\nwith him more than half his time. She also asked me what I thought of\nher nephew. I evaded the question by querying if he was always so quiet\nand good-tempered.\n\n\"Oh dear, no. He is considered a particularly bad-tempered man. Not one\nof the snarling nasty tempers, but--\"\n\nHere the re-entry of the owner of the temper put a stop to this\nconversation.\n\nHarold gave O'Doolan rides on his back, going on all-fours. She shouted\nin childish glee, and wound up by curling her small proportions on his\nbroad chest, and going to sleep there.\n\nMrs Benson had sent for little O'Doolan, and Harold took her home next\nday. He invited me to accompany him, so we set out in the sulky with\nO'Doolan on my lap. It was a pleasant drive of twelve miles to and from\nWyambeet. O'Doolan was much distressed at parting from Mr Beecham, but\nhe promised to come for her again shortly.\n\n\"One little girl at a time is enough for me to care for properly,\" he\nsaid to me in the winning manner with which, and his wealth,\nunintentionally and unconsciously made slaughter among the hearts of the\nfair sex.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER SIXTEEN\n\nWhen Fortune Smiles\n\n\n\"Now, Harold, you have compelled Sybylla to come here, you must not let\nthe time drag with her,\" said Miss Beecham.\n\nIt was the second day after my arrival at Five-Bob. Lunch was over, and\nwe had adjourned to the veranda. Miss Beecham was busy at her\nwork-table; I was ensconced on a mat on the floor reading a book; Harold\nwas stretched in a squatter's chair some distance away. His big brown\nhands were clasped behind his head, his chin rested on his broad chest,\nhis eyes were closed, he occasionally thrust his lower lip forward and\nsent a puff of breath upwards to scatter the flies from his face; he\nlooked a big monument of comfort, and answered his aunt's remarks\nlazily:\n\n\"Yes, aunt, I'll do my best;\" and to me, \"Miss Melvyn, while here,\nplease bear in mind that it will be no end of pleasure to me to do\nanything for your enjoyment. Don't fail to command me in any way.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Mr Beecham. I will not fail to avail myself of your offer.\"\n\n\"The absurdity of you two children addressing each other so formally,\"\nsaid Miss Beecham. \"Why, you are a sort of cousins almost, by right of\nold friendship between the families. You must call me aunt.\"\n\nAfter this Mr Beecham and I called each other nothing when in Miss\nBeecham's hearing, but adhered to formality on other occasions.\n\nHarold looked so comfortable and lazy that I longed to test how far he\nmeant the offer he had made me.\n\n\"I'm just dying for a row on the river. Would you oblige me?\" I said.\n\n\"Just look at the thermometer!\" exclaimed Miss Augusta. \"Wait till it\ngets cooler, child.\"\n\n\"Oh, I love the heat!\" I replied. \"And I am sure it won't hurt his\nlordship. He's used to the sun, to judge from all appearances.\"\n\n\"Yes, I don't think it can destroy my complexion,\" he said\ngood-humouredly, rubbing his finger and thumb along his stubble-covered\nchin. The bushmen up-country shaved regularly every Sunday morning, but\nnever during the week for anything less than a ball. They did this to\nobviate the blue--what they termed \"scraped pig\"--appearance of the\nfaces of city men in the habit of using the razor daily, and to which\nthey preferred the stubble of a seven-days' beard. \"I'll take you to the\nriver in half an hour,\" he said, rising from his seat. \"First I must\nstick on one of Warrigal's shoes that he's flung. I want him tomorrow,\nand must do it at once, as he always goes lame if ridden immediately\nafter shoeing.\"\n\n\"Shall I blow the bellows?\" I volunteered.\n\n\"Oh no, thanks. I can manage myself. It would be better though if I had\nsome one. But I can get one of the girls.\"\n\n\"Can't you get one of the boys?\" said his aunt.\n\n\"There's not one in. I sent every one off to the Triangle paddock today\nto do some drafting. They all took their quart pots and a snack in their\nsaddle-bags, and won't be home till dark.\"\n\n\"Let me go,\" I persisted; \"I often blow the bellows for uncle Jay-Jay,\nand think it great fun.\"\n\nThe offer of my services being accepted, we set out.\n\nHarold took his favourite horse, Warrigal, from the stable, and led him\nto the blacksmith's forge under an open, stringybark-roofed shed, nearly\ncovered with creepers. He lit a fire and put a shoe in it. Doffing his\ncoat and hat, rolling up his shirt-sleeves, and donning a leather apron,\nhe began preparing the horse's hoof.\n\nWhen an emergency arose that necessitated uncle Jay-Jay shoeing his\nhorses himself. I always manipulated the bellows, and did so with great\ndecorum, as he was very exacting and I feared his displeasure. In this\ncase it was different. I worked the pole with such energy that it almost\nblew the whole fire out of the pan, and sent the ashes and sparks in a\nwhirlwind around Harold. The horse--a touchy beast--snorted and dragged\nhis foot from his master's grasp.\n\n\"That the way to blow?\" I inquired demurely.\n\n\"Take things a little easier,\" he replied.\n\nI took them so very easily that the fire was on the last gasp and the\nshoe nearly cold when it was required.\n\n\"This won't do,\" said Beecham.\n\nI recommenced blowing with such force that he had to retreat.\n\n\"Steady I steady!\" he shouted.\n\n\"Sure O'i can't plaze yez anyhows,\" I replied.\n\n\"If you don't try to plaze me directly I'll punish you in a way you\nwon't relish,\" he said laughingly. But I knew he was thinking of a\npunishment which I would have secretly enjoyed.\n\n\"If you don't let me finish this work I'll make one of the men do it\ntonight by candle-light when they come home tired. I know you wouldn't\nlike them to do that,\" he continued.\n\n\"Arrah, go on, ye're only tazin'!\" I retorted. \"Don't you remember\ntelling me that Warrigal was such a nasty-tempered brute that he allowed\nno one but yourself to touch him?\"\n\n\"Oh well, then, I'm floored, and will have to put up with the\nconsequences,\" he good-humouredly made answer.\n\nSeeing that my efforts to annoy him failed, I gave in, and we were soon\ndone, and then started for the river--Mr Beecham clad in a khaki suit\nand I in a dainty white wrapper and flyaway sort of hat. In one hand my\nhost held a big white umbrella, with which he shaded me from the hot\nrays of the October sun, and in the other was a small basket containing\ncake and lollies for our delectation.\n\nHaving traversed the half-mile between the house and river, we pushed\noff from the bank in a tiny boat just big enough for two. In the teeth\nof Harold's remonstrance I persisted in dangling over the boat-side to\ndabble in the clear, deep, running water. In a few minutes we were in\nit. Being unable to swim, but for my companion it would have been all up\nwith me. When I rose to the surface he promptly seized me, and without\nmuch effort, clothes and all, swam with me to the bank, where we\nlanded--a pair of sorry figures. Harold had mud all over his nose, and\nin general looked very ludicrous. As soon as I could stand I laughed.\n\n\"Oh, for a snapshot of you!\" I said.\n\n\"We might have both been drowned,\" he said sternly.\n\n\"Mights don't fly,\" I returned. \"And it was worth the dip to see you\nlooking such a comical article.\" We were both minus our hats.\n\nHis expression relaxed.\n\n\"I believe you would laugh at your own funeral. If I look queer, you\nlook forty times worse. Run for your life and get a hot bath and a drop\nof spirits or you'll catch your death of cold. Aunt Augusta will take a\nfit and tie you up for the rest of the time in case something more will\nhappen to you.\"\n\n\"Catch a death of cold!\" I ejaculated. \"It is only good, pretty little\ngirls, who are a blessing to everyone, who die for such trifles; girls\nlike I am always live till nearly ninety, to plague themselves and\neverybody else. I'll sneak home so that your aunt won't see me, and no\none need be a bit the wiser.\"\n\n\"You'll be sun-struck!\" he said in dismay.\n\n\"Take care you don't get daughter-struck,\" I said perkily, turning to\nflee, for it had suddenly dawned upon me that my thin wet clothing was\noutlining my figure rather too clearly for propriety.\n\nBy a circuitous way I managed to reach my bedroom unseen. It did not\ntake me long to change my clothes, hang them to dry, and appear on the\nmain veranda where Miss Augusta was still sewing. I picked up the book I\nhad left on the mat, and, taking up a position in a hammock near her, I\ncommenced to read.\n\n\"You did not stay long at the river,\" she remarked. \"Have you been\nwashing your head? I never saw the like of it. Such a mass of it. It\nwill take all day to dry.\"\n\nHalf an hour later Harold appeared dressed in a warm suit of tweed. He\nwas looking pale and languid, as though he had caught a chill, and\nshivered as he threw himself on a lounge. I was feeling none the worse\nfor my immersion.\n\n\"Why did you change your clothes, Harold? You surely weren't cold on a\nday like this. Sybylla has changed hers too, when I come to notice it,\nand her hair is wet. Have you had an accident?\" said Miss Augusta,\nrising from her chair in a startled manner.\n\n\"Rubbish!\" ejaculated Harold in a tone which forbade further\nquestioning, and the matter dropped.\n\nShe presently left the veranda, and I took the opportunity to say, \"It\nis yourself that requires the hot bath and a drop of spirits, Mr\nBeecham.\"\n\n\"Yes; I think I'll take a good stiff nobbler. I feel a trifle squeamish.\nIt gave me a bit of a turn when I rose to the top and could not see you.\nI was afraid the boat might have stunned you in capsizing, and you would\nbe drowned before I could find you.\"\n\n\"Yes; I would have been such a loss to the world in general if I had\nbeen drowned,\" I said satirically.\n\n\n\nSeveral jackeroos, a neighbouring squatter, and a couple of bicycle\ntourists turned up at Five-Bob that evening, and we had a jovial night.\nThe great, richly furnished drawing-room was brilliantly lighted, and\nthe magnificent Erard grand piano sang and rang again with music, now\nmartial and loud, now soft and solemn, now gay and sparkling. I made the\nvery pleasant discovery that Harold Beecham was an excellent pianist, a\ngifted player on the violin, and sang with a strong, clear, well-trained\ntenor, which penetrated far into the night. How many, many times I have\nlived those nights over again! The great room with its rich\nappointments, the superb piano, the lights, the merriment, the breeze\nfrom the east, rich with the heavy intoxicating perfume of countless\nflowers; the tall perfect figure, holding the violin with a master hand,\nmaking it speak the same language as I read in the dark eyes of the\nmusician, while above and around was the soft warmth of an Australian\nsummer night.\n\nAh, health and wealth, happiness and youth, joy and light, life and\nlove! What a warm-hearted place is the world, how full of pleasure,\ngood, and beauty, when fortune smiles! _When fortune smiles!_\n\n\n\nFortune did smile, and broadly, in those days. We played tricks on one\nanother, and had a deal of innocent fun and frolic. I was a little\nstartled one night on retiring to find a huge goanna near the head of my\nbed. I called Harold to dislodge the creature, when it came to light\nthat it was roped to the bedpost. Great was the laughter at my expense.\nWho tethered the goanna I never discovered, but I suspected Harold. In\nreturn for this joke, I collected all the portable clocks in the\nhouse--about twenty--and arrayed them on his bedroom table. The majority\nof them were Waterburys for common use, so I set each alarm for a\ndifferent hour. Inscribing a placard \"Hospital for Insane\", I erected it\nabove his door. Next morning I was awakened at three o'clock by fifteen\nalarms in concert outside my door. When an hour or two later I emerged I\nfound a notice on my door, \"This way to the Zoo\".\n\nIt was a very busy time for the men at Five-Bob. Waggons were arriving\nwith shearing supplies, for it was drawing nigh unto the great event of\nthe year. In another week's time the bleat of thousands of sheep, and\nthe incense of much tar and wool, would be ascending to the heavens from\nthe vicinity of Five-Bob Downs. I was looking forward to the shearing.\nThere never was any at Caddagat. Uncle did not keep many sheep, and\nalways sold them long-woolled and rebought after shearing.\n\nI had not much opportunity of persecuting Harold during the daytime. He\nand all his subordinates were away all day, busy drafting, sorting, and\notherwise pottering with sheep. But I always, and Miss Augusta\nsometimes, went to meet them coming home in the evening. It was great\nfun. The dogs yelped and jumped about. The men were dirty with much\ndust, and smelt powerfully of sheep, and had worked hard all day in the\nblazing sun, but they were never too tired for fun, or at night to\ndance, after they had bathed and dressed. We all had splendid horses.\nThey reared and pranced; we galloped and jumped every log which came in\nour path. Jokes, repartee, and nonsense rattled off our tongues. We did\nnot worry about thousands of our fellows--starving and reeking with\ndisease in city slums. We were selfish. We were heedless. We were happy.\nWe were young.\n\n\n\nHarold Beecham was a splendid host. Anyone possessed of the least talent\nfor enjoyment had a pleasant time as his guest. He was hospitable in a\nquiet unostentatious manner. His overseer, jackeroos, and other\nemployees were all allowed the freedom of home, and could invite whom\nthey pleased to Five-Bob Downs. It is all very well to talk of good\nhosts. Bah, I could be a good hostess myself if I had Harold Beecham's\nsuperior implements of the art! With an immense station, plenty of\nhouse-room, tennis courts, musical instruments; a river wherein to fish,\nswim, and boat; any number of horses, vehicles, orchards, gardens, guns,\nand ammunition no object, it is easy to be a good host.\n\nI had been just a week at Five-Bob when uncle Julius came to take me\nhome, so I missed the shearing. Caddagat had been a dull hole without\nme, he averred, and I must return with him that very day. Mr and Miss\nBeecham remonstrated. Could I not be spared at least a fortnight longer?\nIt would be lonely without me. Thereupon uncle Jay-Jay volunteered to\nprocure Miss Benson from Wyambeet as a substitute. Harold declined the\noffer with thanks.\n\n\"The schemes of youngsters are very transparent,\" said uncle Jay-Jay and\nMiss Augusta, smiling significantly at us. I feigned to be dense, but\nHarold smiled as though the insinuation was not only known, but also\nagreeable to him.\n\nUncle was inexorable, so home I had to go. It was sweet to me to hear\nfrom the lips of my grandmother and aunt that my absence had been felt.\n\nAs a confidante aunt Helen was the pink of perfection--tactful and\nsympathetic. My feather-brained chatter must often have bored her, but\nshe apparently was ever interested in it.\n\nI told her long yarns of how I had spent my time at the Beechams; of the\ndeafening duets Harold and I had played on the piano; and how he would\npersist in dancing with me, and he being so tall and broad, and I so\nsmall, it was like being stretched on a hay-rack, and very fatiguing. I\ngave a graphic account of the arguments--tough ones they were too--that\nMiss Augusta had with the overseer on religion, and many other subjects;\nof one jackeroo who gabbed never-endingly about his great relations at\nhome; another who incessantly clattered about spurs, whips, horses, and\nsport; and the third one--Joe Archer--who talked literature and trash\nwith me.\n\n\"What was Harry doing all this time?\" asked auntie. \"What did he say?\"\n\nHarold had been present all the while, yet I could not call to mind one\nthing he had said. I cannot remember him ever holding forth on a subject\nor cause, as most people do at one time or another.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER SEVENTEEN\n\nIdylls of Youth\n\n\nIn pursuance of his duty a government mail-contractor passed Caddagat\nevery Monday, dropping the Bossier mail as he went. On Thursday we also\ngot the post, but had to depend partly on our own exertions.\n\nA selector at Dogtrap, on the Wyambeet run, at a point of the compass\nten miles down the road from Caddagat, kept a hooded van. Every Thursday\nhe ran this to and from Gool-Gool for the purpose of taking to market\nvegetables and other farm produce. He also took parcels and passengers,\nboth ways, if called upon to do so. Caddagat and Five-Bob gave him a\ngreat deal of carrying, and he brought the mail for these and two or\nthree other places. It was one of my duties, or rather privileges, to\nride thither on Thursday afternoon for the post, a leather bag slung\nround my shoulders for the purpose. I always had a splendid mount, and\nthe weather being beautifully hot, it was a jaunt which I never failed\nto enjoy. Frank Hawden went with me once or twice--not because grannie\nor I thought his escort necessary. The idea was his own; but I gave him\nsuch a time that he was forced to relinquish accompanying me as a bad\njob.\n\nHarold Beecham kept a snivelling little Queensland black boy as a sort\nof black-your-boots, odd-jobs slavey or factotum, and he came to Dogtrap\nfor the mail, but after I started to ride for it Harold came regularly\nfor his mail himself. Our homeward way lay together for two miles, but\nhe always came with me till nearly in sight of home. Some days we raced\ntill our horses were white with lather; and once or twice mine was in\nsuch a state that we dismounted, and Harold unsaddled him and wiped the\nsweat off with his towel saddle-cloth, to remove the evidence of hard\nriding, so that I would not get into a scrape with uncle Jay-Jay. Other\ntimes we dawdled, so that when we parted the last rays of sunset would\nbe laughing at us between the white trunks of the tall gum-trees, the\nkookaburras would be making the echoes ring with their mocking\ngood-night, and scores of wild duck would be flying quickly roostward.\nAs I passed through the angle formed by the creek and the river, about\nhalf a mile from home, there came to my ears the cheery clink-clink of\nhobble-chains, the jangle of horse-bells, and the gleam of a dozen\ncamp-fires. The shearing was done out in Riverina now, and the men were\nall going home. Day after day dozens of them passed along the long white\nroad, bound for Monaro and the cool country beyond the blue peaks to the\nsoutheast, where the shearing was about to begin. When I had come to\nCaddagat the last of them had gone \"down\" with horses poor; now they\nwere travelling \"up\" with their horses--some of them\nthoroughbreds--rolling fat, and a cheque for their weeks of back-bending\nlabour in their pockets. But whether coming or going they always made to\nCaddagat to camp. That camping-ground was renowned as the best from\nMonaro to Riverina. It was a well-watered and sheltered nook, and the\nground was so rich that there was always a mouthful of grass to be had\nthere. It was a rare thing to see it without a fire; and the empty\njam-tins, bottles, bits of bag, paper, tent-pegs, and fish-tins to be\nfound there would have loaded a dozen waggons.\n\nThursday evening was always spent in going to Dogtrap, and all the other\ndays had their pleasant tasks and were full of wholesome enjoyment. The\nblue senna flowers along the river gave place to the white bloom of the\ntea-tree. Grannie, uncle, and aunt Helen filled the house with girl\nvisitors for my pleasure. In the late afternoon, as the weather got hot,\nwe went for bogeys in a part of the river two miles distant. Some of the\ngirls from neighbouring runs brought their saddles, others from town had\nto be provided therewith, which produced a dearth in sidesaddles, and it\nwas necessary for me to take a man's. With a rollicking gallop and a\nbogey ahead, that did not trouble me. Aunt Helen always accompanied us\non our bathing expeditions to keep us in check. She was the only one who\nbothered with a bathing-dress. The rest of us reefed off our clothing,\nin our hurry sending buttons in all directions, and plunged into the\npleasant water. Then--such water-fights, frolic, laughter, shouting and\nroaring fun as a dozen strong healthy girls can make when enjoying\nthemselves. Aunt Helen generally called time before we were half\ninclined to leave. We would linger too long, then there would be a great\nscramble for clothes, next for horses, and with wet hair streaming on\nour towels, we would go home full belt, twelve sets of galloping hoofs\nmaking a royal clatter on the hard dusty road. Grannie made a rule that\nwhen we arrived late we had to unsaddle our horses ourselves, and not\ndisturb the working men from their meal for our pleasure. We mostly were\nlate, and so there would be a tight race to see who would arrive at\ntable first. A dozen heated horses were turned out unceremoniously, a\ndozen saddles and bridles dumped down anywhere anyhow, and their\noccupants, with wet dishevelled hair and clothing in glorious disarray,\nwould appear at table averring that they were starving.\n\nThe Caddagat folk were enthusiastic anglers. Fishing was a favourite and\noften enjoyed amusement of the household. In the afternoon a tinful of\nworms would be dug out of one of the water-races, tackle collected,\nhorses saddled, and grannie, uncle, aunt, Frank Hawden, myself, and any\none else who had happened to drop in, would repair to the fish-holes\nthree miles distant. I hate fishing. Ugh! The hideous barbarity of\nshoving a hook through a living worm, and the cruelty of taking the fish\noff the hook! Uncle allowed no idlers at the river--all had to\nmanipulate a rod and line. Indulging in pleasant air-castles, I\ngenerally forgot my cork till the rod would be jerked in my hand, when I\nwould pull--too late! the fish would be gone. Uncle would lecture me for\nbeing a jackdaw, so next time I would glare at the cork unwinkingly, and\npull at the first signs of it bobbing--too soon! the fish would escape\nagain, and I would again be in disgrace. After a little experience I\nfound it was a good plan to be civil to Frank Hawden when the prospect\nof fishing hung around, and then he would attend to my line as well as\nhis own, while I read a book which I smuggled with me. The fish-hole was\nsuch a shrub-hidden nook that, though the main road passed within two\nhundred yards, neither we nor our horses could be seen by the travellers\nthereon. I lay on the soft moss and leaves and drank deeply of the\nbeauties of nature. The soft rush of the river, the scent of the shrubs,\nthe golden sunset, occasionally the musical clatter of hoofs on the\nroad, the gentle noises of the fishers fishing, the plop, plop of a\nplatypus disporting itself mid stream, came to me as sweetest elixir in\nmy ideal, dream-of-a-poet nook among the pink-based, grey-topped,\nmoss-carpeted rocks.\n\nI was a creature of joy in those days. Life is made up of little things.\nIt was a small thing to have a little pocket-money to spend on anything\nthat took my fancy--a very small thing, and yet how much pleasure it\ngave me. Though eating is not one of the great aims of my life, yet it\nwas nice to have enough of any delicacy one fancied. Not that we ever\nwent hungry at home, but when one has nothing to eat in the hot weather\nbut bread and beef it gives them tendency to dream of fruit and cool\ndainties. When one thinks of the countless army of one's fellows who are\ndaily selling their very souls for the barest necessaries of life, I\nsuppose we--irresponsible beings--should be thankful to God for allowing\nus, by scratching and scraping all our lives, to keep a crust in our\nmouth and a rag on our back. I am not thankful, I have been guilty of\nwhat Pat would term a \"digresshion\"--I started about going for the mail\nat Dogtrap. Harold Beecham never once missed taking me home on\nThursdays, even when his shearing was in full swing and he must have\nbeen very busy. He never once uttered a word of love to me--not so much\nas one of the soft nothings in which young people of opposite sexes\noften deal without any particular significance. Whether he went to all\nthe bother and waste of time accruing from escorting me home out of\ngentlemanliness alone, was a mystery to me. I desired to find out, and\nresolved to drive instead of ride to Dogtrap one day to see what he\nwould say.\n\nGrannie assented to the project. Of course I could drive for once if I\ndidn't feel able to ride, but the horses had been spelling for a long\ntime and were very frisky. I must take Frank with me or I might get my\nneck broken.\n\nI flatly opposed the idea of Frank Hawden going with me. He would make a\nmull of the whole thing. It was no use arguing with grannie and\nimpressing upon her the fact that I was not the least nervous concerning\nthe horses. I could take Frank with me in the buggy, ride, or stay at\nhome. I preferred driving. Accordingly the fat horses were harnessed to\nthe buggy, and with many injunctions to be careful and not forget the\nparcels, we set out. Frank Hawden's presence spoilt it all, but I\ndetermined to soon make short work of him.\n\nThere was one gate to go through, about four miles from the house. Frank\nHawden got out to open it. I drove through, and while he was pushing it\nto, laid the whip on the horses and went off full tilt. He ran after me\nshouting all manner of things that I could not hear on account of the\nrattle of the buggy. One horse began kicking up, so, to give him no time\nfor further pranks, I drove at a good round gallop, which quickly left\nthe lovable jackeroo a speck in the distance. The dust rose in thick\nclouds, the stones rattled from the whirling wheels, the chirr! chirr!\nof a myriad cicadas filled the air, and the white road glistened in the\ndazzling sunlight. I was enjoying myself tip-top, and chuckled to think\nof the way I had euchred Frank Hawden. It was such a good joke that I\nconsidered it worth two of the blowings-up I was sure of getting from\ngrannie for my conduct.\n\nIt was not long before I fetched up at Dogtrap homestead, where,\ntethered to the \"six-foot\" paling fence which surrounded the\nflower-garden, was Harold Beecham's favourite, great, black,\nsaddle-horse Warrigal. The vicious brute turned his beautiful head,\ndisplaying a white star on the forehead, and snorted as I approached.\nHis master appeared on the veranda raising his soft panama hat, and\nremarking, \"Well I never! You're not by yourself, are you?\"\n\n\"I am. Would you please tell Mrs Butler to bring out grannie's parcels\nand post at once. I'm afraid to dawdle, it's getting late.\"\n\nHe disappeared to execute my request and reappeared in less than a\nminute.\n\n\"Mr Beecham, please would you examine Barney's harness. Something must\nbe hurting him. He has been kicking up all the way.\"\n\nExamining the harness and noticing the sweat that was dripping from the\nanimals, panting from their run, he said:\n\n\"It looks as though you've been making the pace a cracker. There is\nnothing that is irritating Barney in the least. If he's putting on any\nairs it is because he is frisky and not safe for you to drive. How did\nJulius happen to let you away by yourself?\"\n\n\"I'm not frightened,\" I replied.\n\n\"I see you're not. You'd be game to tackle a pair of wild elephants, I\nknow, but you must remember you're not much bigger than a sparrow\nsitting up there, and I won't let you go back by yourself.\"\n\n\"You cannot stop me.\"\n\n\"I can.\"\n\n\"You can't.\"\n\n\"I can.\"\n\n\"You can't.\"\n\n\"I can.\"\n\n\"How?\"\n\n\"I'm going with you,\" he said.\n\n\"You're not.\"\n\n\"I am.\"\n\n\"You're not.\"\n\nI am\".\n\n\"You ar-r-re not.\"\n\n\"I am\".\n\n\"You are, ar-r-re not.\"\n\n\"We'll see whether I will or not in a minute or two,\" he said with\namusement.\n\n\"But, Mr Betcham, I object to your company. I am quite capable of taking\ncare of myself; besides, if you come home with me I will not be allowed\nout alone again--it will be altogether unpleasant for me.\"\n\nMrs Butler now appeared with the mail and some parcels, and Harold\nstowed them in the buggy.\n\n\"You'd better come in an' 'ave a drop of tay-warter, miss, the kittle's\nbilin'; and I have the table laid out for both of yez.\"\n\n\"No, thank you, Mrs Butler. I can't possibly stay today, it's getting\nlate. I must hurry off. Good-bye! Good afternoon, Mr Beecham.\"\n\nI turned my buggy and pair smartly round and was swooping off. Without a\nword Harold was at their heads and seized the reins. He seized his\nhorse's bridle, where it was over the paling, and in a moment had him\ntied on the off-side of Barney, then stepping quietly into the buggy he\nput me away from the driver's seat as though I were a baby, quietly took\nthe reins and whip, raised his hat to Mrs Butler, who was smiling\nknowingly, and drove off.\n\nI was highly delighted with his action, as I would have despised him as\na booby had he given in to me, but I did not let my satisfaction appear.\nI sat as far away from him as possible, and pretended to be in a great\nhuff. For a while he was too fully occupied in making Barney \"sit up\" to\nnotice me, but after a few minutes he looked round, smiling a most\nannoying and pleasant smile.\n\n\"I'd advise you to straighten out your chin. It is too round and soft to\nlook well screwed up that way,\" he said provokingly.\n\nI tried to extinguish him with a look, but it had not the desired\neffect.\n\n\"Now you had better be civil, for I have got the big end of the whip,\"\nhe said.\n\n\"I reserve to myself the right of behaving as I think fit in my own\nuncle's buggy. You are an intruder; it is yourself that should be\ncivil.\"\n\nI erected my parasol and held it so as to tease Harold. I put it down so\nthat he could not see the horses. He quietly seized my wrist and held it\nout of his way for a time, and then loosing me said, \"Now, behave.\"\n\nI flouted it now, so that his ears and eyes were endangered, and he was\nforced to hold his hat on.\n\n\"I'll give you three minutes to behave, or I'll put you out,\" he said\nwith mock severity.\n\n\"Shure it's me wot's behavin' beautiful,\" I replied, continuing my\nnonsense.\n\nHe pulled rein, seized me in one arm, and lifted me lightly to the\nground.\n\n\"Now, you can walk till you promise to conduct yourself like a\nChristian!\" he said, driving at a walk.\n\n\"If you wait till I promise anything, you'll wait till the end of the\ncentury. I'm quite capable of walking home.\"\n\n\"You'll soon get tired of walking in this heat, and your feet will he\nblistered in a mile with those bits of paper.\"\n\nThe bits of paper to which he alluded were a pair of thin-soled white\ncanvas slippers--not at all fitted for walking the eight miles on the\nhard hot road ahead of me. I walked resolutely on, without deigning a\nglance at Harold, who had slowed down to a crawling walk.\n\n\"Aren't you ready to get up now?\" he inquired presently.\n\nI did not reply. At the end of a quarter of a mile he jumped out of the\nbuggy, seized upon me, lifted me in, and laughed, saying, \"You're a very\nslashing little concern, but you are not big enough to do much damage.\"\n\nWe were about half-way home when Barney gave a tremendous lurch,\nbreaking a trace and some other straps. Mr Beecham was at the head of\nthe plunging horse in a twinkling. The harness seemed to be scattered\neverywhere.\n\n\"I expect I had better walk on now,\" I remarked.\n\n\"Walk, be grannied! With two fat lazy horses to draw you?\" returned Mr\nBeecham.\n\nMen are clumsy, stupid creatures regarding little things, but in their\nright place they are wonderful animals. If a buggy was smashed to\nsmithereens, from one of their many mysterious pockets they would\nproduce a knife and some string, and put the wreck into working order in\nno time.\n\nHarold was as clever in this way as any other man with as much bushman\nability as he had, so it was not long ere we were bowling along as\nmerrily as ever.\n\nJust before we came in sight of Caddagat he came to a standstill, jumped\nto the ground, untied Warrigal, and put the reins in my hand, saying:\n\n\"I think you can get home safely from here. Don't be in such a huff--I\nwas afraid something might happen you if alone. You needn't mention that\nI came with you unless you like. Good-bye.\"\n\n\"Good-bye, Mr Beecham. Thank you for being so officious,\" I said by way\nof a parting shot.\n\n\"Old Nick will run away with you for being so ungrateful,\" he returned.\n\n\"Old Nick will have me anyhow,\" I thought to myself as I drove home amid\nthe shadows. The hum of the cicadas was still, and dozens of rabbits,\ntempted out by the cool of the twilight, scuttled across my path and hid\nin the ferns.\n\nI wished the harness had not broken, as I feared it would put a clincher\non my being allowed out driving alone in future.\n\nJoe Slocombe, the man who acted as groom and rouseabout, was waiting for\nme at the entrance gate.\n\n\"I'm glad you come at last, Miss Sybyller. The missus has been in a\ndreadful stoo for fear something had happened yuz. She's been runnin' in\nan' out like a gurrl on the look-out fer her lover, and was torkin' of\nsendin' me after yuz, but she went to her tea soon as she see the buggy\ncome in sight. I'll put all the parcels on the back veranda, and yuz can\ngo in at woncest or yuz'll be late fer yer tea.\"\n\n\"Joe, the harness broke and had to be tied up. That is what kept me so\nlate,\" I explained.\n\n\"The harness broke!\" he exclaimed. \"How the doose is that! Broke here in\nthe trace, and that strap! Well, I'll be hanged! I thought them straps\ncouldn't break only onder a tremenjous strain. The boss is so dashed\npartickler too. I believe he'll sool me off the place; and I looked at\nthat harness only yesterday. I can't make out how it come to break so\nsimple. The boss will rise the devil of a shine, and say you might have\nbeen killed.\"\n\nThis put a different complexion on things. I knew Joe Slocombe could\nmend the harness with little trouble, as it was because he was what\nuncle Jay-Jay termed a \"handy divil\" at saddlery that he was retained at\nCaddagat. I said carelessly:\n\n\"If you mend the harness at once, Joe, uncle Julius need not be bothered\nabout it. As it happened, there is no harm done, and I won't mention the\nmatter.\"\n\n\"Thank you, miss,\" he said eagerly. \"I'll mend it at once.\"\n\nNow that I had that piece of business so luckily disposed of, I did not\nfeel the least nervous about meeting grannie. I took the mail in my arms\nand entered the dining-room, chirping pleasantly:\n\n\"Grannie, I'm such a good mail-boy. I have heaps of letters, and did not\nforget one of your commissions.\"\n\n\"I don't want to hear that now,\" she said, drawing her dear old mouth\ninto a straight line, which told me I was not going to palm things off\nas easily as I thought. \"I want a reason for your conduct this\nafternoon.\"\n\n\"Explain what, grannie?\" I inquired.\n\n\"None of that pretence! Not only have you been most outrageously\ninsulting to Mr Hawden when I sent him with you, but you also\ndeliberately and wilfully disobeyed me.\"\n\nUncle Julius listened attentively, and Hawden looked at me with such a\nleer of triumph that my fingers tingled to smack his cars. Turning to my\ngrandmother, I said distinctly and cuttingly:\n\n\"Grannie, I did not intentionally disobey you. Disobedience never\nentered my head. I hate that thing. His presence was detestable to me.\nWhen he got out at the gate I could not resist the impulse to drive off\nand leave him there. He looked such a complete jackdaw that you would\nhave laughed yourself to see him.\"\n\n\"Dear, oh dear! You wicked hussy, what will become of you!\" And grannie\nshook her head, trying to look stern, and hiding a smile in her\nserviette.\n\n\"Your manners are not improving, Sybylla. I fear you must be\nincorrigible,\" said aunt Helen.\n\nWhen uncle Jay-Jay heard the whole particulars of the affair, he lay\nback in his chair and laughed fit to kill himself.\n\n\"You ought to be ashamed to always encourage her in her tomboyish ways,\nJulius. It grieves me to see she makes no effort to acquire a ladylike\ndemeanour,\" said grannie.\n\nMr Hawden had come off second-best, so he arose from his half-finished\nmeal and stamped out, banging the door after him, and muttering\nsomething about \"a disgustingly spoilt and petted tomboy\", \"a hideous\nbarbarian\", and so forth.\n\nUncle Jay-Jay related that story to everyone, dwelling with great\ndelight upon the fact that Frank Hawden was forced to walk four miles in\nthe heat and dust.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER EIGHTEEN\n\nAs Short as I Wish had been the Majority of Sermons to which I have been\nForced to give Ear\n\n\nWhen alone I confessed to aunt Helen that Harold had accompanied me to\nwithin a short distance of home. She did not smile as usual, but looked\nvery grave, and, drawing me in front of her, said:\n\n\"Sybylla, do you know what you are doing? Do you love Harry Beecham? Do\nyou mean to marry him?\"\n\n\"Aunt Helen, what a question to ask! I never dreamt of such a thing. He\nhas never spoken a word of love to me. Marriage! I am sure he does not\nfor an instant think of me in that light. I'm not seventeen.\"\n\n\"Yes, you are young, but some people's age cannot be reckoned by years.\nI am glad to see you have developed a certain amount of half-real and\nhalf-assumed youthfulness lately, but when the novelty of your present\nlife wears away, your old mature nature will be there, so it is of no\nuse feigning childishness. Harold Beecham is not given to speech--action\nwith him is the same thing. Can you look at me straight, Sybylla, and\nsay that Harold has not extended you something more than common\npoliteness?\"\n\nHad aunt Helen put that question to me a day before, I would have\nblushed and felt guilty. But today not so. The words of the jackeroo the\nnight before had struck home. \"A hideous barbarian\", he had called me,\nand it seemed to me he had spoken the truth. My life had been so\npleasant lately that I had overlooked this fact, but now it returned to\nsting with redoubled bitterness. I had no lovable qualities to win for\nme the love of my fellows, which I so much desired.\n\nI returned aunt Helen a gaze as steady as her own, and said bitterly:\n\n\"Aunt Helen, I can truly say he has never, and will never extend to me\nmore than common politeness. Neither will any other man. Surely you know\nenough of masculine human nature to see there is no danger of a man\nlosing his heart to a plain woman like me. Love in fancy and song is a\npretty myth, embracing unity of souls, congeniality of tastes, and such\nlike commodities. In workaday reality it is the lowest of passions,\nwhich is set alight by the most artistic nose and mouth, and it matters\nnot if its object is vile, low, or brainless to idiocy, so long as it\nhas these attributes.\"\n\n\"Sybylla, Sybylla,\" said auntie sadly, as if to herself. \"In the first\nflush of girlhood, and so bitter. Why is this?\"\n\n\"Because I have been cursed with the power of seeing, thinking, and,\nworse than all, feeling, and branded with the stinging affliction of\nugliness,\" I replied.\n\n\"Now, Sybylla, you are going to think of yourself again. Something has\nput you out. Be sensible for once in a way. What you have said of men's\nlove may be true in a sense, but it is not always so, and Harry is not\nthat kind of man. I have known him all his life, and understand him, and\nfeel sure he loves you truly. Tell me plainly, do you intend to accept\nhim?\"\n\n\"Intend to accept him!\" I echoed. \"I haven't once thought of such a\npossibility. I never mean to marry anyone.\"\n\n\"Don't you care for Harold? Just a little? Think.\"\n\n\"How could I care for him?\"\n\n\"For many, many reasons. He is young, and very kind and gentle. He is\none of the biggest and finest-looking men you could find. He is a man\nwhom no one could despise, for he has nothing despicable about him. But,\nbest of all, he is true, and that, I think, is the bedrock of all\nvirtues.\"\n\n\"But he is so conceited,\" I remarked.\n\n\"That does not make him any the less lovable. I know another young\nperson very conceited, and it does not prevent me from loving her\ndearly,\" here aunt Helen smiled affectionately at me. \"What you complain\nof in Harold will wear off presently--life has been very easy for him so\nfar, you see.\"\n\n\"But, auntie, I'm sure he thinks he could have any girl for the asking.\"\n\n\"Well, he has a great number to choose from, for they all like him.\"\n\n\"Yes, just for his money,\" I said scornfully. \"But I'll surprise him if\nhe thinks he can get me for the asking.\"\n\n\"Sybylla, never flirt. To play with a man's heart, I think, is one of\nthe most horribly unwomanly actions our sex can be guilty of.\"\n\n\"I would scorn to flirt with any man,\" I returned with vigour. \"Play\nwith a man's heart! You'd really think they had such a thing, aunt\nHelen, to hear you talk. Hurt their vanity for a few days is the most a\nwoman could do with any of them. I am sick of this preach, preach about\nplaying with men's hearts. It is an old fable which should have been\nabolished long ago. It does not matter how a woman is played with.\"\n\n\"Sybylla, you talk at random. The shortcomings of men are no excuse for\nyou to be unwomanly,\" said aunt Helen.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER NINETEEN\n\nThe 9th of November 1896\n\n\nThe Prince of Wales's birthday up the country was celebrated as usual\nthereaway by the annual horse-races on the Wyambeet course, about\nfourteen miles from Caddagat.\n\nThe holding of these races was an elderly institution, and was followed\nat night by a servants' ball given by one of the squatters. Last year it\nhad been Beecham's ball, the year before Bossier's, and this year it was\nto take place in the woolshed of James Grant of Yabtree. Our two girls,\nthe gardener, and Joe Slocombe the groom, were to be present, as also\nwere all the other employees about. Nearly every one in the\ndistrict--masters and men--attended the races. We were going, Frank\nHawden volunteering to stay and mind the house.\n\nWe started at nine o'clock. Grannie and uncle Boss sat in the front seat\nof the buggy, and aunt Helen and I occupied the back. Uncle always drove\nat a good round gallop. His idea was to have good horses, not donkeys,\nand not to spare them, as there were plenty more to be had any day. On\nthis morning he went off at his usual pace. Grannie urged as\nremonstrance that the dust was fearful when going at that rate. I\nclapped my hands and exclaimed, \"Go it, Mr Bossier! Well done, uncle\nJay-Jay! Hurrah for Clancy!\"\n\nUncle first said he was glad to see I had the spirit of an Australian,\nand then threatened to put my nose above my chin if I failed to behave\nproperly. Grannie remarked that I might have the spirit of an\nAustralian, but I had by no means the manners of a lady; while aunt\nHelen ventured a wish that I might expend all my superfluous spirits on\nthe way, so that I would be enabled to deport myself with a little\ndecorum when arrived at the racecourse.\n\nWe went at a great pace; lizards and goannas scampered out of the way in\ndozens, and, clambering trees, eyed us unblinkingly as we passed. Did we\nsee a person or vehicle a tiny speck ahead of us--in a short time they\nwere as far away in the background.\n\n\"Please, uncle, let me drive,\" I requested.\n\n\"Couldn't now. Your grannie can't sit in the back-seat--neither could\nI--and look like a tame cockatoo while you sat in front. You ask Harry\nto let you drive him. I bet he'll consent; he's sure to be in a sulky\nwith a spare seat on spec. We're sure to overtake him in a few minutes.\"\n\nThere was a vehicle in the distance which proved to be from Five-Bob\nDowns, but as we overhauled it, it was the drag, and not a sulky. Harold\noccupied the driver's seat, and the other occupants were all ladies. I\nnoticed the one beside him was wearing a very big hat, all ruffles,\nflowers, and plumes.\n\n\"Shall I pull up and get you a seat?\" inquired uncle Jay-Jay.\n\n\"No, no, no.\"\n\nThe boss of Five-Bob drew to his side of the road, and when we had\npassed uncle began to tease:\n\n\"Got faint-hearted, did you? The flower-garden on that woman's hat\ncorked your chances altogether. Never mind, don't you funk; I'll see\nthat you have a fair show. I'll get you a regular cart-wheel next time I\ngo to town, and we'll trim it up with some of old Barney's tail. If that\nwon't fetch him, I'm sure nothing will.\"\n\nBefore we got to the racecourse Barney went lame through getting a stone\nin his hoof; this caused a delay which enabled the Five-Bob trap to\ncatch us, and we pulled rein a little distance apart at the same time,\nto alight.\n\nMr Beecham's groom went to his horses' heads while Harold himself\nassisted his carriageful of ladies to set foot on the ground. Aunt Helen\nand grannie went to talk to them, but I stayed with uncle Jay-Jay while\nhe took the horses out. Somehow I was feeling very disappointed. I had\nexpected Harold Beecham to be alone. He had attended on me so absolutely\neverywhere I had met him lately, that I had unconsciously grown to look\nupon him as mine exclusively; and now, seeing he would belong to his own\nparty of ladies for the day, things promised to be somewhat flat without\nhim.\n\n\"I told that devil of a Joe to be sure and turn up as soon as I arrived.\nI wanted him to water the horses, but I can't see him anywhere--the\ninfernal, crawling, doosed idiot!\" ejaculated uncle Julius.\n\n\"Never mind, uncle, let him have his holiday. I suppose he'd like to\nhave time to spoon with his girl. I can easily water the horses.\"\n\n\"That would suit Joe, I have no doubt; but I don't pay him to let you\nwater the horses. I'll water 'em myself.\"\n\nHe led one animal, I took the other, and we went in the direction of\nwater a few hundred yards away.\n\n\"You run along to your grannie and the rest of them, and I'll go by\nmyself,\" said uncle, but I kept on with the horse.\n\n\"You mustn't let a five-guinea hat destroy your hopes altogether,\" he\ncontinued, with a mischievous twinkle in his eyes. \"If you stick to your\nguns you have a better show than anyone to bag the boss of Five-Bob.\"\n\n\"I am at a loss to interpret your innuendo, Mr Bossier,\" I said stiffly.\n\n\"Now, little woman, you think you are very smart, but you can't deceive\nme. I've seen the game you and Harry have been up to this last month. If\nit had been any other man, I would have restricted your capers long\nago.\"\n\n\"Uncle--\" I began.\n\n\"Now, Sybylla, none of your crammers. There is no harm in being a bit\ngone on Harry. It's only natural, and just what I'd expect. I've known\nhim since he was born, and he's a good all-round fellow. His head is\nscrewed on the right way, his heart is in the right place, and his\nprinciples are tip-top. He could give you fal-de-rals and rubbish to no\nend, and wouldn't be stingy either. You'll never get a better man. Don't\nyou be put out of the running so cheaply: hold your own and win, that's\nmy advice to you. There is nothing against him, only temper--old Nick\nhimself isn't a patch on him for temper.\"\n\n\"Temper!\" I exclaimed. \"He is always so quiet and pleasant.\"\n\n\"Yes, he controls it well. He's a fellow with a will like iron, and that\nis what you want, as I find you have none of your own. But be careful of\nHarry Beecham in a temper. He is like a raging lion, and when his temper\ndies away is a sulking brute, which is the vilest of all tempers. But he\nis not vindictive, and is easy managed, if you don't mind giving in and\ncoaxing a little.\"\n\n\"Now, uncle, you have had your say, I will have mine. You seem to think\nI have more than a friendly regard for Mr Beecham, but I have not. I\nwould not marry him even if I could. I am so sick of every one thinking\nI would marry any man for his possessions. I would not stoop to marry a\nking if I did not love him. As for trying to win a man, I would scorn\nany action that way; I never intend to marry. Instead of wasting so much\nmoney on me in presents and other ways, I wish you would get me\nsomething to do, a profession that will last me all my life, so that I\nmay be independent.\"\n\n\"No mistake, you're a rum youngster. You can be my companion till\nfurther orders. That's a profession that will last you a goodish while.\"\n\nWith this I had to be contented, as I saw he considered what I had said\nas a joke.\n\nI left uncle and went in quest of grannie, who, by this, was beyond the\nother side of the course, fully a quarter of a mile away. Going in her\ndirection I met Joe Archer, one of the Five-Bob jackeroos, and a great\nchum of mine. He had a taste for literature, and we got on together like\none o'clock. We sat on a log under a stringybark-tree and discussed the\nbooks we had read since last we met, and enjoyed ourselves so much that\nwe quite forgot about the races or the flight of time until recalled\nfrom book-land by Harold Beecham's voice.\n\n\"Excuse me, Miss Melvyn, but your grannie has commissioned me to find\nyou as we want to have lunch, and it appears you are the only one who\nknows the run of some of the tucker bags.\"\n\n\"How do you do, Mr Beecham? Where are they going to have lunch?\"\n\n\"Over in that clump of box-trees,\" he replied, pointing in the direction\nof a little rise at a good distance.\n\n\"How are you enjoying yourself?\" he asked, looking straight at me.\n\n\"Treminjous intoirely, sor,\" I replied.\n\n\"I suppose you know the winner of every race,\" he remarked, quizzically\nwatching Joe Archer, who was blushing and as uneasy as a schoolgirl when\nnabbed in the enjoyment of an illicit love-letter.\n\n\"Really, Mr Beecham, Mr Archer and I have been so interested in\nourselves that we quite forgot there was such a thing as a race at all,\"\nI returned.\n\n\"You'd better see where old Boxer is. He might kick some of the other\nhorses if you don't keep a sharp look-out,\" he said, turning to his\njackeroo.\n\n\"Ladies before gentlemen,\" I interposed. \"I want Mr Archer to take me to\ngrannie, then he can go and look after old Boxer.\"\n\n\"I'll escort you,\" said Beecham.\n\n\"Thank you, but I have requested Mr Archer to do so.\"\n\n\"In that case, I beg your pardon, and will attend to Boxer while Joe\ndoes as you request.\"\n\nRaising his hat he walked swiftly away with a curious expression on his\nusually pleasant face.\n\n\"By Jove, I'm in for it!\" ejaculated my escort. \"The boss doesn't get\nthat expression on his face for nothing. You take my tip for it, he felt\ninclined to seize me by the scruff of the neck and kick me from here to\nYabtree.\"\n\n\"Go on!\"\n\n\"It's a fact. He did not believe in me not going to do his bidding\nimmediately. He has a roaring derry on disobedience. Everyone has to\nobey him like winkie or they can take their beds up and trot off quick\nand lively.\"\n\n\"Mr Beecham has sufficient sense to see I was the cause of your\ndisobedience,\" I replied.\n\n\"That's where it is. He would not have cared had it been some other\nlady, but he gets mad if any one dares to monopolize you. I don't know\nhow you are going to manage him. He is a pretty hot member sometimes.\"\n\n\"Mr Archer, you presume! But throwing such empty banter aside, is Mr\nBeecham really bad-tempered?\"\n\n\"Bad-tempered is a tame name for it. You should have seen the dust he\nraised the other day with old Benson. He just did perform.\"\n\nI was always hearing of Harold Beecham's temper, and wished I could see\na little of it. He was always so imperturbably calm, and unfailingly\ngood-tempered under the most trying circumstances, that I feared he had\nno emotions in him, and longed to stir him up.\n\nGrannie greeted me with, \"Sybylla, you are such a tiresome girl. I don't\nknow how you have packed these hampers, and we want to have lunch. Where\non earth have you been?\"\n\nMiss Augusta Beecham saluted me warmly with a kiss, and presented me to\nher sister Sarah, who also embraced me. I went through an introduction\nto several ladies and gentlemen, greeted my acquaintances, and then set\nto work in dead earnest to get our provisions laid out--the Five-Bob\nDowns party had theirs in readiness. Needless to say, we were combining\nforces. I had my work completed when Mr Beecham appeared upon the scene\nwith two young ladies. One was a bright-faced little brunette, and the\nother a tall light blonde, whom, on account of her much trimmed hat, I\nrecognized as the lady who had been sitting on the box-seat of the\nBeecham drag that morning.\n\nJoe Archer informed me in a whisper that she was Miss Blanche Derrick\nfrom Melbourne, and was considered one of the greatest beauties of that\ncity.\n\nThis made me anxious to examine her carefully, but I did not get an\nopportunity of doing so. In the hurry to attend on the party, I missed\nthe honour of an introduction, and when I was at leisure she was sitting\nat some distance on a log, Harold Beecham shading her in a most\nreligious manner with a dainty parasol. In the afternoon she strolled\naway with him, and after I had attended to the remains of the feast, I\ntook Joe Archer in tow. He informed me that Miss Derrick had arrived at\nFive-Bob three days before, and was setting her cap determinedly at his\nboss.\n\n\"Was she really very handsome?\" I inquired.\n\n\"By Jove, yes!\" he replied. \"But one of your disdainful haughty\nbeauties, who wouldn't deign to say good-day to a chap with less than\nsix or seven thousand a year.\"\n\nI don't know why I took no interest in the races. I knew nearly all the\nhorses running. Some of them were uncle's; though he never raced horses\nhimself, he kept some swift stock which he lent to his men for the\noccasion.\n\nOf more interest to me than the races was the pair strolling at a\ndistance. They were fit for an artist's models. The tall, broad,\nindependent figure of the bushman with his easy gentlemanliness, his\njockey costume enhancing his size. The equally tall majestic form of the\ncity belle, whose self-confident fashionable style spoke of nothing\nappertaining to girlhood, but of the full-blown rose--indeed, a splendid\npair physically!\n\nThen I thought of my lack of beauty, my miserable five-feet-one-inch\nstature, and I looked at the man beside me, small and round-shouldered,\nand we were both dependent children of indigence. The contrast we\npresented to the other pair struck me hard, and I laughed a short bitter\nlaugh.\n\nI excused myself to my companion, and acceded to the request of several\nchildren to go on a flower- and gum-hunting expedition. We were a long\ntime absent, and returning, the little ones scampered ahead and left me\nalone. Harold Beecham came to meet me, looking as pleasant as ever.\n\n\"Am I keeping grannie and uncle waiting?\" I inquired.\n\n\"No. They have gone over an hour,\" he replied.\n\n\"Gone! How am I to get home? She must have been very angry to go and\nleave me. What did she say?\"\n\n\"On the contrary, she was in great fiddle. She said to tell you not to\nkill yourself with fun, and as you are not going home, she left me to\nsay good night. I suppose she kisses you when performing that ceremony,\"\nhe said mischievously.\n\n\"Where am I going tonight?\"\n\n\"To Five-Bob Downs, the camp of yours truly,\" he replied.\n\n\"I haven't got a dinner dress, and am not prepared. I will go home.\"\n\n\"We have plenty dinner dresses at Five-Bob without any more. It is Miss\nMelvyn we want,\" he said.\n\n\"Oh, bother you!\" I retorted. \"Men are such stupid creatures, and never\nunderstand about dress or anything. They think you could go to a ball in\na wrapper.\"\n\n\"At all events, they are cute enough to know when they want a young lady\nat their place, no matter how she's dressed,\" he said good-humouredly.\n\nOn reaching the racecourse I was surprised to see aunt Helen there. From\nher I learnt that grannie and uncle Jay-Jay had really gone home, but Mr\nBeecham had persuaded them to allow aunt Helen and me to spend the night\nat Five-Bob Downs, our host promising to send or take us home on the\nmorrow. Now that I was to have aunt Helen with me I was delighted at the\nprospect, otherwise I would have felt a little out of it. With aunt\nHelen, however, I was content anywhere, and built a castle in the air,\nwherein one day she and I were always to live together--for ever! Till\ndeath!\n\nGoing home aunt Helen occupied a front seat with Harold and Miss\nDerrick, and I was crammed in at the back beside Miss Augusta, who\npatted my hand and said she was delighted to see me.\n\nA great concourse of young men and women in vehicles and on horseback,\nand in expectation of great fun, were wending their way to\nYabtree--nearly every trap containing a fiddle, concertina, flute, or\naccordion in readiness for the fray.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER TWENTY\n\nSame Yarn--continued\n\n\nEvery station hand from Five-Bob, male and female, had gone to the ball\nat Yabtree. Harold and his overseer had to attend to the horses, while\nthe jackeroos started a fire in the kitchen, opened windows and doors\nwhich had been locked all day, and saw to the comfort of the gentlemen\nguests.\n\nAunt Helen and I shared the one bedroom. As we had not fresh dresses to\nput on we had to make the best of our present toilet.\n\nI unplaited my hair (shook the dust out of it) and wore it flowing. We\nwashed and dusted ourselves, and wore as adornment--roses. Crimson and\ncream roses paid the penalty of peeping in the window. Aunt Helen\nplucked some of them, which she put in my hair and belt, and pinned\ncarefully at my throat, and then we were ready. Miss Beecham assured us\nthere was nothing to be done, as the maids had set the table and\nprepared the viands for a cold meal before leaving in the morning, so we\nproceeded to the drawing-room to await the arrival of the other\nvisitors. They soon made their appearance. First, two stout old\nsquatters with big laughs and bigger corporations, then Miss Augusta\nBeecham, next Joe Archer the overseer, and the two other jackeroos.\nAfter these appeared a couple of governesses, Mr, Mrs, and Miss Benson,\na clergyman, an auctioneer, a young friend of Harold's from Cootamundra,\na horse-buyer, a wool-classer, Miss Sarah Beecham, and then Miss Derrick\nbrought herself and her dress in with great style and airs. She was\ngarbed in a sea-green silk, and had jewellery on her neck, arms, and\nhair. Her self-confident mien was suggestive of the conquest of many\nmasculine hearts. She was a big handsome woman. Beside her, I in my\ncrushed white muslin dress was as overshadowed as a little white\nhandkerchief would be in comparison to a gorgeous shawl heavily wrought\nin silks and velvet. She was given the best seat as though she were a\nprincess. She sat down with great indifference, twirled a bracelet round\nher wrist, languidly opened her fan, and closed her eyes as she wafted\nit slowly to and fro.\n\n\"By Jove, isn't she a splendid creature?\" enthusiastically whispered a\ngentleman sitting beside me.\n\nI looked at her critically. She was very big, and in a bony stiff way\nwas much developed in figure. She had a nice big nose, and a long\nwell-shaped face, a thin straight mouth, and empty light eyes. If my\nattention had not been called to her I would not have noticed her one\nway or the other, but being pointed to as a beauty, I weighed her\naccording to my idea of facial charm, and pronounced her one of the most\ninsipid-looking people I had set eyes upon.\n\nShe was the kind of woman with whom men become much infatuated. She\nwould never make a fool of herself by letting her emotions run away with\nher, because she had no emotions, but lived in a sea of unruffled\nself-consciousness and self-confidence. Any man would be proud to\nintroduce her as his wife to his friends whom he had brought home to\ndinner. She would adorn the head of his table. She would never worry him\nwith silly ideas. She would never act with impropriety. She would never\nbecome a companion to her husband. Bah, a man does not want his wife to\nbe a companion! There were myths and fables in the old day; so there are\nnow. The story that men like a companion as well as a wife is an\nup-to-date one.\n\nThis train of thought was interrupted by our host, who appeared in the\ndoorway, clad from sole to neck in white. We steered for the\ndining-room--twenty-two all told--thirteen men and nine representatives\nof the other sex.\n\nAunt Helen got one seat of honour near the head of the table and Miss\nDerrick another. I drifted to the foot among the unimportant younger\nfry, where we had no end of fun and idle chatter. We had to wait on\nourselves, and as all formality was dispensed with, it was something\nlike a picnic.\n\nThe heat was excessive. Every window and door were open, and the balmy,\nalmost imperceptible, zephyrs which faintly rustled the curtains and\nkissed our perspiration-beaded brows were rich with many scents from the\nwide old flower-garden, which, despite the drought, brought forth a\nwealth of blossom.\n\nWhen done eating we had to wash the dishes. Such a scamper ensued back\nand forwards to the kitchen, which rang with noise, and merriment.\nEveryone was helping, hindering, laughing, joking, teasing, and brimming\nover with fun and enjoyment. When we had completed this task, dancing\nwas proposed. Some of the elderly and more sensible people said it was\ntoo hot, but all the young folks did not care a rap for the temperature.\nHarold had no objections, Miss Derrick was agreeable, Miss Benson\nannounced herself ready and willing, and Joe Archer said he was\n\"leppin'\" to begin, so we adjourned to the dancing-room and commenced\noperations.\n\nI played the piano for the first quadrille, and aunt Helen for the\nsecond dance. It was most enjoyable. There was a table at one end of the\nroom on which was any amount of cherries, lollies, cake, dainties,\nbeers, syrups, and glasses, where all could regale themselves without\nceremony or bother every time the inclination seized them. Several doors\nand windows of the long room opened into the garden, and, provided one\nhad no fear of snakes, it was delightful to walk amid the flowers and\ncool oneself between dances.\n\nA little exertion on such a night made us very hot. After the third\ndance the two old squatters, the horse-buyer, the clergyman, and Mr\nBenson disappeared. Judging from the hilarity of their demeanour and the\nkilling odour of their breaths when they returned an hour or so later,\nduring their absence they must have conscientiously sampled the contents\nof every whisky decanter on the dining-room sideboard.\n\nI could not dance, but had no lack of partners, as, ladies being in the\nminority, the gentlemen had to occasionally put up with their own sex in\na dance.\n\n\"Let's take a breeze now and have a song or two, but no more dancing for\na while,\" said some of them; but Harold Beecham said, \"One more turn,\nand then we will have a long spell and a change of programme.\"\n\nHe ordered Joe Archer to play a waltz, and the floor soon held several\nwhirling couples. Harold \"requested the pleasure\" of me--the first time\nthat night. I demurred. He would not take a refusal.\n\n\"Believe me, if I felt competent, Mr Beecham, I would not refuse. I\ncannot dance. It will be no pleasure to you.\"\n\n\"Allow me to be the best judge of what is a pleasure to me,\" he said,\nquietly placing me in position.\n\nHe swung me once round the room, and then through an open window into\nthe garden.\n\n\"I am sorry that I haven't had more time to look after you today. Come\nround into my room. I want to strike a bargain with you,\" were his\nwords.\n\nI followed him in the direction of a detached building in the garden.\nThis was Harold's particular domain. It contained three rooms--one a\nlibrary and office, another an arsenal and deed-room, and the third,\ninto which he led me, was a sort of sitting-room, containing a piano,\nfacilities for washing, a table, easy-chairs, and other things. As we\nentered I noticed the lamp, burning brightly on the table, gleamed on\nthe face of a clock on the wall, which pointed to half past ten.\n\nWe stood beside the table, some distance apart, and, facing me, he said:\n\n\"It is no use of me making a long yarn about nothing. I'm sure you know\nwhat I want to say better than I do myself. You always are wonderfully\nsmart at seeing through a fellow. Tell me, will it be yes or no?\"\n\nThis was an experience in love. He did not turn red or white, or yellow\nor green, nor did he tremble or stammer, or cry or laugh, or become\nfierce or passionate, or tender or anything but just himself, as I had\nalways known him. He displayed no more emotion than had he been inviting\nme to a picnic. This was not as I had pictured a man would tell his\nlove, or as I had read of it, heard of it, or wished it should be. A\ncurious feeling--disappointment, perhaps--stole over me. His\nmatter-of-fact coolness flabbergasted me.\n\n\"Is this not rather sudden? You have given me no intimation of your\nintentions,\" I stammered.\n\n\"I didn't think it wise to dawdle any longer,\" he replied. \"Surely you\nhave known what I've been driving at ever since I first clapped eyes on\nyou. There's plenty of time. I don't want to hurry you, only I want you\nto be engaged to me for safety.\"\n\nHe spoke as usual in his slow twangy drawl, which would have proclaimed\nhis Colonial nationality anywhere. No word of love was uttered to me and\nnone requested from me.\n\nI put it down to his conceit. I thought that he fancied he could win any\nwoman, and me without the least palaver or trouble. I felt annoyed. I\nsaid aloud, \"I will become engaged to you;\" to myself I added, \"Just for\na little while, the more to surprise and take the conceit out of you\nwhen the time comes.\"\n\nNow that I understand his character I know that it was not conceit, but\njust his quiet unpretending way. He had meant all his actions towards\nme, and had taken mine in return.\n\n\"Thank you, Sybylla, that is all I want. We will talk about the matter\nmore some other time. I will go up to Caddagat next Sunday. You have\nsurprised me nearly out of my wits,\" here he laughed. \"I never dreamt\nyou would say yes so easily, just like any other girl. I thought I would\nhave a lot of trouble with you.\"\n\nHe approached me and was stooping to kiss me. I cannot account for my\naction or condemn it sufficiently. It was hysterical--the outcome of an\noverstrung, highly excitable, and nervous temperament. Perhaps my vanity\nwas wounded, and my tendency to strike when touched was up in arms. The\ncalm air of ownership with which Harold drew near annoyed me, or, as\nSunday-school teachers would explain it, Satan got hold of me. He\ncertainly placed a long strong riding-whip on the table beneath my hand!\nAs Harold stooped with the intention of pressing his lips to mine, I\nquickly raised the whip and brought it with all my strength right across\nhis face. The instant the whip had descended I would have smashed my arm\non the door-post to recall that blow. But that was impossible. It had\nleft a great weal on the healthy sun-tanned skin. His moustache had\nsaved his lips, but it had caught his nose, the left cheek, had blinded\nthe left eye, and had left a cut on the temple from which drops of blood\nwere rolling down his cheek and staining his white coat. A momentary\ngleam of anger shot into his eyes and he gave a gasp, whether of\nsurprise, pain, or annoyance, I know not. He made a gesture towards me.\nI half expected and fervently wished he would strike. The enormity of\nwhat I had done paralysed me. The whip fell from my fingers and I\ndropped on to a low lounge behind me, and placing my elbows on my knees\ncrouchingly buried my face in my hands; my hair tumbled softly over my\nshoulders and reached the floor, as though to sympathetically curtain my\nhumiliation. Oh, that Harold would thrash me severely! It would have\ninfinitely relieved me. I had done a mean unwomanly thing in thus\nstriking a man, who by his great strength and sex was debarred\nretaliation. I had committed a violation of self-respect and common\ndecency; I had given a man an ignominious blow in the face with a\nriding-whip. And that man was Harold Beecham, who with all his strength\nand great stature was so wondrously gentle--who had always treated my\nwhims and nonsense with something like the amused tolerance held by a\ngreat Newfoundland for the pranks of a kitten.\n\nThe clock struck eleven.\n\n\"A less stinging rebuke would have served your purpose. I had no idea\nthat a simple caress from the man whose proposal of marriage you had\njust accepted would be considered such an unpardonable familiarity.\"\n\nHarold's voice fell clearly, calmly, cuttingly on the silence. He moved\naway to the other end of the room and I heard the sound of water.\n\nA desire filled me to tell him that I did not think he had attempted a\nfamiliarity, but that I had been mad. I wished to say I could not\naccount for my action, but I was dumb. My tongue refused to work, and I\nfelt as though I would choke. The splash of the water came from the\nother end of the room. I knew he must be suffering acute pain in his\neye. A far lighter blow had kept me sleepless a whole night. A fear\npossessed me that I might have permanently injured his sight. The splash\nof water ceased. His footfall stopped beside me. I could feel he was\nwithin touching distance, but I did not move.\n\nOh, the horrible stillness! Why did he not speak? He placed his hand\nlightly on my head.\n\n\"It doesn't matter, Syb. I know you didn't mean to hurt me. I suppose\nyou thought you couldn't affect my dark, old, saddle-flap-looking phiz.\nThat is one of the disadvantages of being a big lumbering concern like I\nam. Jump up. That's the girl.\"\n\nI arose. I was giddy, and would have fallen but for Harold steadying me\nby the shoulder. I looked up at him nervously and tried to ask his\nforgiveness, but I failed.\n\n\"Good heavens, child, you are as white as a sheet! I was a beast to\nspeak harshly to you.\" He held a glass of water to my lips and I drank.\n\n\"Great Jupiter, there's nothing to worry about! I know you hadn't the\nslightest intention of hurting me. It's nothing--I'll be right in a few\nmoments. I've often been amused at and have admired your touch-me-not\nstyle. You only forgot you had something in your hand.\"\n\nHe had taken it quite as a matter of fact, and was excusing me in the\nkindest possible terms.\n\n\"Good gracious, you mustn't stew over such a trifling accident! It's\nnothing. Just tie this handkerchief on for me, please, and then we'll go\nback to the others or there will be a search-party after us.\"\n\nHe could have tied the handkerchief just as well himself--it was only\nout of kindly tact he requested my services. I accepted his kindness\ngratefully. He sank on his knee so that I could reach him, and I tied a\nlarge white handkerchief across the injured part. He could not open his\neye, and hot water poured from it, but he made light of the idea of it\npaining. I was feeling better now, so we returned to the ballroom. The\nclock struck the half-hour after eleven as we left the room. Harold\nentered by one door and, I by another, and I slipped into a seat as\nthough I had been there some time.\n\nThere were only a few people in the room. The majority were absent--some\nlove-making, others playing cards. Miss Beecham was one who was not thus\nengaged. She exclaimed at once:\n\n\"Good gracious, boy, what have you done to yourself?\"\n\n\"Looks as if he had been interviewing a belligerent tramp,\" said aunt\nHelen, smilingly.\n\n\"He's run into the clothes-line, that's what he's done,\" said Miss\nAugusta confidently, after she had peeped beneath the bandage.\n\n\"You ought to get a bun for guessing, aunt Gus,\" said Harold laughing.\n\n\"I told them to put the clothes-lines up when they had done with them. I\nknew there would be an accident.\"\n\n\"Perhaps they were put up high enough for ordinary purposes,\" remarked\nher nephew.\n\n\"Let me do something for you, dear.\"\n\n\"No, thank you, aunt Gus. It is nothing,\" he said carelessly, and the\nmatter dropped.\n\nHarold Beecham was not a man to invite inquiry concerning himself.\n\nSeeing I was unobserved by the company, I slipped away to indulge in my\nfoolish habit of asking the why and the wherefore of things. Why had\nHarold Beecham (who was a sort of young sultan who could throw the\nhandkerchief where he liked) chosen me of all women? I had no charms to\nrecommend me--none of the virtues which men demand of the woman they\nwish to make their wife. To begin with, I was small, I was erratic and\nunorthodox, I was nothing but a tomboy--and, cardinal disqualification,\nI was ugly. Why, then, had he proposed matrimony to me? Was it merely a\nwhim? Was he really in earnest?\n\nThe night was soft and dark; after being out in it for a time I could\ndiscern the shrubs dimly silhouetted against the light. The music struck\nup inside again. A step approached me on the gravelled walk among the\nflowers, and Harold called me softly by name. I answered him.\n\n\"Come,\" he said, \"we are going to dance; will you be my partner?\"\n\nWe danced, and then followed songs and parlour games, and it was in the\nsmall hours when the merry goodnights were all said and we had retired\nto rest. Aunt Helen dropped to sleep in a short time; but I lay awake\nlistening to the soft distant call of the mopokes in the scrub beyond\nthe stables.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER TWENTY-ONE\n\nMy Unladylike Behaviour Again\n\n\nJoe Archer was appointed to take us home on the morrow. When our host\nwas seeing us off--still with his eye covered--he took opportunity of\nwhispering to me his intention of coming to Caddagat on the following\nSunday.\n\nEarly in the afternoon of that day I took a book, and, going down the\nroad some distance, climbed up a broad-branched willow-tree to wait for\nhim.\n\nIt was not long before he appeared at a smart canter. He did not see me\nin the tree, but his horse did, and propping, snorted wildly, and gave a\nbackward run. Harold spurred him, he bucked spiritedly. Harold now saw\nme and sang out:\n\n\"I say, don't frighten him any more or he'll fling me, saddle and all. I\nhaven't got a crupper or a breastplate.\"\n\n\"Why haven't you, then? Hang on to him. I do like the look of you while\nthe horse is going on like that.\"\n\nHe had dismounted, and had thrown the bridle rein over a post of the\nfence.\n\n\"I came with nothing but a girth, and that loose, as it was so hot; and\nI was as near as twopence to being off, saddle and all. You might have\nbeen the death of me,\" he said good-humouredly.\n\n\"Had I been, my fortune would have been made,\" I replied.\n\n\"How do you make that out? You're as complimentary as ever.\"\n\n\"Everyone would be wanting to engage me as the great noxious weed-killer\nand poisonous insect exterminator if I made away with you,\" I answered.\nI gave him an invitation to take a seat with me, and accepting, he swung\nup with easy grace. There was any amount of accommodation for the two of\nus on the good-natured branches of the old willow-tree.\n\nWhen he had settled himself, my companion said, \"Now, Syb, I'm ready for\nyou. Fire away. But wait a minute, I've got something here for you which\nI hope you'll like.\"\n\nAs he searched in his pockets, I noticed that his eye had quite\nrecovered, though there was still a slight mark on his cheek. He handed\nme a tiny morocco case, which on being opened disclosed a costly ring. I\nhave about as much idea of the prices of things as a turkey would have.\nPerhaps that ring cost thirty pounds or possibly fifty guineas, for all\nI know. It was very heavy, and had a big diamond supported on either\nside by a large sapphire, and had many small gems surrounding it.\n\n\"Let me see if it fits,\" he said, taking my hand; but I drew it away.\n\n\"No; don't you put it on. That would make us irrevocably engaged.\"\n\n\"Isn't that what we intend to be?\" he said in a tone of surprise.\n\n\"Not just yet; that is what I want to say to you. We will have three\nmonths' probation to see how we get on. At the end of that time, if we\nmanage to sail along smoothly, we'll have the real thing; until then we\nwill not be any more than we have been to each other.\"\n\n\"But what am I to do in the meantime?\" he asked, with amusement curving\nthe corners of his mouth.\n\n\"Do! Do the usual thing, of course; but don't pay me any special\nattentions, or I'll be done with you at once.\"\n\n\"What's your idea for this?\"\n\n\"It is no use making fools of ourselves; we might change our minds.\"\n\n\"Very well; so be it,\" he said laughing. \"I might have known you would\nhave things arranged different from any other girl. But you'll take the\nring and wear it, won't you? Let me put it on.\"\n\n\"No; I won't let you put a finger on me till the three months are up.\nThen, if we definitely make up our minds, you can put it on; but till\nthen, don't for the life of you hint by word or sign that we have any\nsort of an arrangement between us. Give me the ring and I'll wear it\nsometimes.\"\n\nHe handed it to me again, and I tried it on. It was a little large.\nHarold took it, and tried to put it on one of his fingers. It would fit\non none but the very top of his little finger. We laughed heartily at\nthe disparity in the size of our hands.\n\n\"I'll agree to your bargain,\" he said. \"But you'll be really engaged to\nme all the same.`\n\n\"Yes; under those conditions. Then it will not matter if we have a tiff.\nWe can part, and no one will be the wiser.\"\n\nOn my suggesting that it was now time to go to the house, he swung\nhimself down by a branch and turned to assist me. Descending from that\ntree was a feat which presented no difficulties to me when no one was\nby, but now it seemed an awkward performance.\n\n\"Just lead your horse underneath, so that I can get on to his back,\nthence to the ground quite easily,\" I said.\n\n\"No fear! Warrigal wouldn't stand that kind of dodge. Won't I do? I\ndon't think your weight will quite squash me,\" he returned, placing\nhimself in leap-frog position, and I stepped on to his back and slid\nfrom there to the ground quite easily.\n\nThat afternoon, when leaving the house, I had been followed by one of\nthe dogs, which, when I went up the willow-tree, amused himself chasing\nwater lizards along the bank of the creek. He treed one, and kept up a\nfurious barking at the base of its refuge. The yelping had disturbed\ngrannie where she was reading on the veranda, and coming down the road\nunder a big umbrella to see what the noise was about, as luck would have\nit she was in the nick of time to catch me standing on Harold Beecham's\nback. Grannie frequently showed marked displeasure regarding what she\ntermed my larrikinism, but never before had I seen her so thoroughly\nangry. Shutting her umbrella, she thrust at me with it, saying, \"shame!\nshame! You'll come to some harm yet, you immodest, bold, bad hussy! I\nwill write to your mother about you. Go home at once, miss, and confine\nyourself in your room for the remainder of the day, and don't dare eat\nanything until tomorrow. Spend the time in fasting, and pray to God to\nmake you better. I don't know what makes you so forward with men. Your\nmother and aunt never gave me the slightest trouble in that way.\"\n\nShe pushed me from her in anger, and I turned and strode housewards\nwithout a word or glancing behind. I could hear grannie deprecating my\nconduct as I departed, and Harold quietly and decidedly differing from\nher.\n\nFrom the time of my infancy punishment of any description never had a\nbeneficial effect upon me. But dear old grannie was acting according to\nher principles in putting me through a term of penance, so I shut myself\nin my room as directed, with goodwill towards her at my heart. I was\nburning with shame. Was I bold and immodest with men, as accused of\nbeing? It was the last indiscretion I would intentionally have been\nguilty of. In associating with men I never realize that the trifling\ndifference of sex is sufficient to be a great wall between us. The fact\nof sex never for an instant enters my head, and I find it as easy to be\nchummy with men as with girls: men in return have always been very good,\nand have treated me in the same way.\n\nOn returning from her walk grannie came to my room, brought me some\npreachy books to read, and held out to me the privilege of saying I was\nsorry, and being restored to my usual place in the society of the\nhousehold.\n\n\"Grannie, I cannot say I am sorry and promise to reform, for my\nconscience does not reproach me in the least. I had no evil--not even a\nviolation of manners--in my intentions; but I am sorry that I vexed\nyou,\" I said.\n\n\"Vexing me is not the sinful part of it. It is your unrepentant heart\nthat fills me with fears for your future. I will leave you here to think\nby yourself. The only redeeming point about you is, you do not pretend\nto be sorry when you are not.\"\n\nThe dear old lady shook her head sorrowfully as she departed.\n\nThe afternoon soon ran away, as I turned to my bookcase for\nentertainment and had that beautiful ring to admire.\n\nI heard them come in to tea, and I thought Harold had gone till I heard\nuncle Jay-Jay address him:\n\n\"Joe Archer told me you ran into a clothes-line on race-night, and ever\nsince then mother has kept up a daddy of a fuss about ours. We've got\nprops about a hundred feet long, and if you weren't in the know you'd\nthink we had a telegraph wire to old St Peter up above.\"\n\nI wondered what Harold thought of the woman he had selected as his\nfuture wife being shut up for being a \"naughty girl\". The situation\namused me exceedingly.\n\nAbout nine o'clock he knocked at my window and said:\n\n\"Never mind, Syb. I tried to get you off, but it was no go. Old people\noften have troublesome straitlaced ideas. It will blow over by\ntomorrow.\"\n\nI did not answer; so he passed on with firm regular footfall, and\npresently I heard his horse's hoof-beats dying away in the darkness, and\nthe closing and locking of doors around me as the household retired for\nthe night.\n\nDuring the following fortnight I saw Harold a good many times at\ncricket-matches, hare-drives, and so forth, but he did not take any\nparticular notice of me. I flirted and frolicked with my other young men\nfriends, but he did not care. I did not find him an ardent or a jealous\nlover. He was so irritatingly cool and matter-of-fact that I wished for\nthe three months to pass so that I might be done with him, as I had come\nto the conclusion that he was barren of emotion or passion of any kind.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER TWENTY-TWO\n\nSWEET SEVENTEEN\n\n\nMonday arrived--last day of November and seventeenth anniversary of my\nbirth--and I celebrated it in a manner which I capitally enjoyed.\n\nIt was the time of the annual muster at Cummabella--a cattle-station\nseventeen miles eastward from Caddagat--and all our men were there\nassisting. Word had been sent that a considerable number of beasts among\nthose yarded bore the impress of the Bossier brand on their hides; so on\nSunday afternoon uncle Jay-Jay had also proceeded thither to be in\nreadiness for the final drafting early on Monday morning. This left us\nmanless, as Frank Hawden, being incapacitated with a dislocated wrist,\nwas spending a few weeks in Gool-Gool until he should be fit for work\nagain.\n\nUncle had not been gone an hour when a drover appeared to report that\ntwenty thousand sheep would pass through on the morrow. Grass was\nprecious. It would not do to let the sheep spread and dawdle at their\ndrovers' pleasure. There was not a man on the place; grannie was in a\ngreat stew; so I volunteered my services. At first she would not hear of\nsuch a thing, but eventually consented. With many injunctions to conduct\nmyself with proper stiffness, I started early on Monday morning. I was\nclad in a cool blouse, a holland riding-skirt, and a big straw hat; was\nseated on a big bay horse, was accompanied by a wonderful sheep-dog, and\ncarried a long heavy stock-whip. I sang and cracked my stock-whip as I\ncantered along, quite forgetting to be reserved and proper. Presently I\ncame upon the sheep just setting out for their day's tramp, with a black\nboy ahead of them, of whom I inquired which was the boss. He pointed\ntowards a man at the rear wearing a donkey-supper hat. I made my way\nthrough the sheep in his direction, and asked if he were in charge of\nthem. On being answered in the affirmative, I informed him that I was Mr\nBossier's niece, and, as the men were otherwise engaged, I would see the\nsheep through.\n\n\"That's all right, miss. I will look out that you don't have much\ntrouble,\" he replied, politely raising his hat, while a look of\namusement played on his face.\n\nHe rode away, and shouted to his men to keep the flock strictly within\nbounds and make good travelling.\n\n\"Right you are, boss,\" they answered; and returning to my side he told\nme his name was George Ledwood, and made some remarks about the great\ndrought and so on, while we rode in the best places to keep out of the\ndust and in the shade. I asked questions such as whence came the sheep?\nwhither were they bound? and how long had they been on the road? And\nhaving exhausted these orthodox remarks, we fell a-talking in dead\nearnest without the least restraint. I listened with interest to stories\nof weeks and weeks spent beneath the sun and stars while crossing widths\nof saltbush country, mulga and myall scrubs, of encounters with blacks\nin Queensland, and was favoured with a graphic description of a big\nstrike among the shearers when the narrator had been boss-of-the-board\nout beyond Bourke. He spoke as though well educated, and a gentleman--as\ndrovers often are. Why, then, was he on the road? I put him down as a\nscapegrace, for he had all the winning pleasant manner of a\nne'er-do-well.\n\nAt noon--a nice, blazing, dusty noon--we halted within a mile of\nCaddagat for lunch. I could have easily ridden home for mine, but\npreferred to have it with the drovers for fun. The men boiled the billy\nand made the tea, which we drank out of tin pots, with tinned fish and\ndamper off tin plates as the completion of the menu, Mr Ledwood and I at\na little distance from the men. Tea boiled in a billy at a bush fire has\na deliciously aromatic flavour, and I enjoyed my birthday lunch\nimmensely. Leaving the cook to collect the things and put them in the\nspring-cart, we continued on our way, lazily lolling on our horses and\nchewing gum-leaves as we went.\n\nWhen the last of the sheep got off the Caddagat run it was nearing two\no'clock.\n\nMr Ledwood and I shook hands at parting, each expressing a wish that we\nmight meet again some day.\n\nI turned and rode homewards. I looked back and saw the drover gazing\nafter me. I waved my hand; he raised his hat and smiled, displaying his\nteeth, a gleam of white in his sun-browned face. I kissed my hand to\nhim; he bowed low; I whistled to my dog; he resumed his way behind the\ncrawling sheep; I cantered home quickly and dismounted at the front gate\nat 2.30 p.m., a dusty, heated, tired girl.\n\nGrannie came out to question me regarding the sex, age, condition, and\nspecies of the sheep, what was their destination, whether they were in\nsearch of grass or were for sale, had they spread or eaten much grass,\nand had the men been civil?\n\nWhen I had satisfactorily informed her on all these points, she bade me\nhave something to eat, to bathe and dress, and gave me a holiday for the\nremainder of the day.\n\nMy hair was grey with dust, so I washed all over, arrayed myself in a\ncool white dress, and throwing myself in a squatter's chair in the\nveranda, spread my hair over the back of it to dry. Copies of Gordon,\nKendall, and Lawson were on my lap, but I was too physically content and\ncomfortable to indulge in even these, my sworn friends and companions. I\nsurrendered myself to the mere joy of being alive. How the sunlight\nblazed and danced in the roadway--the leaves of the gum-trees gleaming\nin it like a myriad gems! A cloud of white, which I knew to be\ncockatoos, circled over the distant hilltop. Nearer they wheeled until I\ncould hear their discordant screech. The thermometer on the wall rested\nat 104 degrees despite the dense shade thrown on the broad old veranda\nby the foliage of creepers, shrubs, and trees. The gurgling rush of the\ncreek, the scent of the flower-laden garden, and the stamp, stamp of a\nhorse in the orchard as he attempted to rid himself of tormenting flies,\nfilled my senses. The warmth was delightful. Summer is heavenly, I\nsaid--life is a joy.\n\nAunt Helen's slender fingers looked artistic among some pretty\nfancy-work upon which she was engaged. Bright butterflies flitted round\nthe garden, and thousands of bees droned lazily among the flowers. I\nclosed my eyes--my being filled with the beauty of it all.\n\nI could hear grannie's pen fly over the paper as she made out a list of\nChristmas supplies on a table near me.\n\n\"Helen, I suppose a hundredweight of currants will be sufficient?\"\n\n\"Yes; I should think so.\"\n\n\"Seven dozen yards of unbleached calico be enough?\"\n\n\"Yes; plenty.\"\n\n\"Which tea-service did you order?\"\n\n\"Number two.\"\n\n\"Do you or Sybylla want anything extra?\"\n\n\"Yes; parasols, gloves, and some books.\"\n\n\"Books! Can I get them at Hordern's?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nGrannie's voice faded on my ears, my thoughts ran on uncle Jay-Jay. He\nhad promised to be home in time for my birthday spread, and I was sure\nhe had a present for me. What would it be?--something nice. He would be\nnearly sure to bring someone home with him from Cummabella, and we would\nhave games and fun to no end. I was just seventeen, only seventeen, and\nhad a long, long life before me wherein to enjoy myself. Oh, it was good\nto be alive! What a delightful place the world was!--so accommodating, I\nfelt complete mistress of it. It was like an orange--I merely had to\nsqueeze it and it gave forth sweets plenteously. The stream sounded far\naway, the sunlight blazed and danced, grannie's voice was a pleasant\nmurmur in my ear, the cockatoos screamed over the house and passed away\nto the west. Summer is heavenly and life is a joy, I reiterated. Joy!\nJoy! There was joy in the quit! quit! of the green-and-crimson parrots,\nwhich swung for a moment in the rose-bush over the gate, and then\nwhizzed on into the summer day. There was joy in the gleam of the sun\nand in the hum of the bees, and it throbbed in my heart. Joy! Joy! A\njackass laughed his joy as he perched on the telegraph wire out in the\nroad. Joy! joy! Summer is a dream of delight and life is a joy, I said\nin my heart. I was repeating the one thing over and over--but ah! it was\na measure of happiness which allowed of much repetition. The cool murmur\nof the creek grew far away, I felt my poetry books slip off my knees and\nfall to the floor, but I was too content to bother about them--too happy\nto need their consolation, which I had previously so often and so\nhungrily sought. Youth! Joy! Warmth!\n\nThe clack of the garden gate, as it swung to, awoke me from a pleasant\nsleep. Grannie had left the veranda, and on the table where she had been\nwriting aunt Helen was filling many vases with maidenhair fern and La\nFrance roses. A pleasant clatter from the dining-room announced that my\nbirthday tea was in active preparation. The position of the yellow\nsunbeams at the far end of the wide veranda told that the dense shadows\nwere lengthening, and that the last of the afternoon was wheeling\nwestward. Taking this in, in an instant I straightened the piece of\nmosquito-netting, which, to protect me from the flies, someone--auntie\nprobably--had spread across my face, and feigned to be yet asleep. By\nthe footsteps which sounded on the stoned garden walk, I knew that\nHarold Beecham was one of the individuals approaching.\n\n\n\n\"How do you do, Mrs Bell? Allow me to introduce my friend, Archie\nGoodchum. Mrs Bell, Mr Goodchum. Hasn't it been a roaster today?\nConsiderably over 100 degrees in the shade. Terribly hot!\"\n\nAunt Helen acknowledged the introduction, and seated her guests, saying:\n\n\"Harry, have you got an artistic eye? If so, you can assist me with\nthese flowers. So might Mr Goodchum, if he feels disposed.\"\n\nHarold accepted the proposal, and remarked:\n\n\"What is the matter with your niece? It is the first time I ever saw her\nquiet.\"\n\n\"Yes; she is a noisy little article--a perfect whirlwind in the\nhouse--but she is a little tired this afternoon; she has been seeing\nthose sheep through today.\"\n\n\"Don't you think it would be a good lark if I get something and tickle\nher?\" said Goodchum.\n\n\"Yes, do,\" said Harold; \"but look out for squalls. She is a great little\nfizzer.\"\n\n\"Then she might be insulted.\"\n\n\"Not she,\" interposed auntie. \"No one will enjoy the fun more than\nherself.\"\n\nI had my eyes half open beneath the net, so saw him cautiously approach\nwith a rose-stem between his fingers. Being extremely sensitive to\ntickling, so soon as touched under the ear I took a flying leap from the\nchair somewhat disconcerting my tormentor.\n\nHe was a pleasant-looking young fellow somewhere about twenty, whose\nface was quite familiar to me.\n\nHe smiled so good-humouredly at me that I widely did the same in return,\nand he came forward with extended hand, exclaiming, \"At last!\"\n\nThe others looked on in surprise, Harold remarking suspiciously, \"You\nsaid you were unacquainted with Miss Melvyn, but an introduction does\nnot seem necessary.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes it is,\" chirped Mr Goodchum. \"I haven't the slightest idea of\nthe young lady's name.\"\n\n\"Don't know each other!\" ejaculated Harold; and grannie, who had\nappeared upon the scene, inquired stiffly what we meant by such capers\nif unacquainted.\n\nMr Goodchum hastened to explain.\n\n\"I have seen the young lady on several occasions in the bank where I am\nemployed, and I had the good fortune to be of a little service to her\none day when I was out biking. Her harness, or at least the harness on\nthe horse she was driving, broke, and I came to the rescue with my\npocket-knife and some string, thereby proving, if not ornamental, I was\nuseful. After that I tried hard to find out who she was, but my\ninquiries always came to nothing. I little dreamt who Miss Melvyn was\nwhen Harry, telling me she was a Goulburn girl, asked if I knew her.\"\n\n\"Quite romantic,\" said aunt Helen, smiling; and a great thankfulness\novercame me that Mr Goodchum had been unable to discover my identity\nuntil now. It was right enough to be unearthed as Miss Melvyn,\ngrand-daughter of Mrs Bossier of Caddagat, and great friend and intimate\nof the swell Beechams of Five-Bob Downs station. At Goulburn I was only\nthe daughter of old Dick Melvyn, broken-down farmer-cockatoo, well known\nby reason of his sprees about the commonest pubs in town.\n\nMr Goodchum told us it was his first experience of the country, and\ntherefore he was enjoying himself immensely. He also mentioned that he\nwas anxious to see some of the gullies around Caddagat, which, he had\nheard, were renowned for the beauty of their ferns. Aunt Helen,\naccordingly, proposed a walk in the direction of one of them, and\nhurried off to attend to a little matter before starting. While waiting\nfor her, Harold happened to say it was my birthday, and Mr Goodchum\ntendered me the orthodox wishes, remarking, \"It is surely pardonable at\nyour time of life to ask what age you have attained today?\"\n\n\"Seventeen.\"\n\n\"Oh! oh! 'sweet seventeen, and never been kissed'; but I suppose you\ncannot truthfully say that, Miss Melvyn?\"\n\n\"Oh yes, I can.\"\n\n\"Well, you won't be able to say it much longer,\" he said, making a\nsuggestive move in my direction. I ran, and he followed, grannie\nreappearing from the dining-room just in time to see me bang the garden\ngate with great force on my pursuer.\n\n\"What on earth is the girl doing now?\" I heard her inquire.\n\nHowever, Mr Goodchum did not execute his threat; instead we walked along\ndecorously in the direction of the nearest ferns, while Harold and aunt\nHelen followed, the latter carrying a sun-bonnet for me.\n\nAfter we had climbed some distance up a gully aunt Helen called out that\nshe and Harold would rest while I did the honours of the fern grots to\nmy companion.\n\nWe went on and on, soon getting out of sight of the others.\n\n\"What do you say to my carving our names on a gum-tree, the bark is so\nnice and soft?\" said the bank clerk; and I seconded the proposal.\n\n\"I will make it allegorical,\" he remarked, setting to work.\n\nHe was very deft with his penknife, and in a few minutes had carved S.\nP. M. and A. S. G., encircling the initials by a ring and two hearts\ninterlaced.\n\n\"That'll do nicely,\" he remarked, and turning round, \"Why, you'll get a\nsunstroke; do take my hat.\"\n\nI demurred, he pressed the matter, and I agreed on condition he allowed\nme to tie his handkerchief over his head. I was wearing his hat and\ntying the ends of a big silk handkerchief beneath his chin when the\ncracking of a twig caused me to look up and see Harold Beecham with an\nexpression on his face that startled me.\n\n\"Your aunt sent me on with your hood,\" he said jerkily.\n\n\"You can wear it--I've been promoted,\" I said flippantly, raising my\nhead-gear to him and bowing. He did not laugh as he usually did at my\ntricks, but frowned darkly instead.\n\n\"We've been carving our names--at least, I have,\" remarked Goodchum.\n\nHarold tossed my sun-bonnet on the ground, and said shortly, \"Come on,\nGoodchum, we must be going.\"\n\n\"Oh, don't go, Mr Beecham. I thought you came on purpose for my birthday\ntea. Auntie has made me a tremendous cake. You must stay. We never\ndreamt of you doing anything else.\"\n\n\"I've changed my mind,\" he replied, striding on at such a pace that we\nhad difficulty in keeping near him. As we resumed our own head-wear,\nGood churn whispered, \"A bulldog ant must have stung the boss. Let's ask\nhim.\"\n\nOn reaching the house we found other company had arrived in the persons\nof young Mr Goodjay from Cummabella, his sister, her governess, and a\ncouple of jackeroos. They were seated on the veranda, and uncle Jay-Jay,\nattired in his shirt-sleeves, was appearing through the dining-room door\nwith half a dozen bottles of home-made ginger ale in his arms. Dumping\nthem down on the floor, he produced a couple of tots from his\nshirt-pockets, saying, \"Who votes for a draw of beer? Everyone must feel\ninclined for a swig. Harry, you want some; you don't look as though the\nheat was good for your temper. Hullo, Archie! Got up this far. Take a\ndraw out of one of these bottles. If there had been a dozen pubs on the\nroad, I'd have drunk every one of em dry today. I never felt such a\ndaddy of a thirst on me before.\"\n\n\"Good gracious, Julius!\" exclaimed grannie, as he offered the governess\na pot full of beer, \"Miss Craddock can't drink out of that pint.\"\n\n\"Those who don't approve of my pints, let 'em bring their own,\" said\nthat mischievous uncle Jay-Jay, who was a great hand at acting the clown\nwhen he felt that way inclined.\n\nI was dispatched for glasses, and after emptying the bottles uncle\nproposed a game of tennis first, while the light lasted, and tea\nafterwards. This proposition being carried with acclamation, we\nproceeded to the tennis court. Harold came too--he had apparently\naltered his intention of going home immediately.\n\nThere were strawberries to be had in the orchard, also some late\ncherries, so uncle ordered me to go and get some. I procured a basket,\nand willingly agreed to obey him. Mr Goodchum offered to accompany me,\nbut Harold stepped forward saying he would go, in such a resolute tragic\nmanner that Goodchum winked audaciously, saying waggishly, \"Behold, the\nhero descends into the burning mine!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER TWENTY-THREE\n\n    \"Ah, For One Hour of Burning Love,\n    'tis Worth an Age of Cold Respect!\"\n\n\nWe walked in perfect silence, Harold not offering to carry my little\nbasket. I did not dare lift my eyes, as something told me the face of\nthe big man would not be pleasant to look upon just then. I twirled the\nring he had given me round and round my finger. I occasionally put it\non, wearing the stones on the palm-side of my finger, so that it would\nnot be taken for other than one of two or three aunt Helen had lent me,\nsaying I was at liberty to use them while at Caddagat, if it gave me any\npleasure.\n\nThe Caddagat orchard contained six acres, and being a narrow enclosure,\nand the cherries growing at the extreme end from the house, it took us\nsome time to reach them. I led the way to our destination--a secluded\nnook where grape-vines clambered up fig-trees, and where the top of\ngooseberry bushes met the lower limbs of cherry-trees. Blue and yellow\nlupins stood knee-high, and strawberries grew wild among them. We had\nnot uttered a sound, and I had not glanced at my companion. I stopped;\nhe wheeled abruptly and grasped my wrist in a manner which sent the\nbasket whirling from my hand. I looked up at his face, which was blazing\nwith passion, and dark with a darker tinge than Nature and the sun had\ngiven it, from the shapely swelling neck, in its soft well-turned-down\ncollar, to where the stiff black hair, wet with perspiration, hung on\nthe wide forehead.\n\n\"Unhand me, sir!\" I said shortly, attempting to wrench myself free, but\nI might as well have tried to pull away from a lion.\n\n\"Unhand me!\" I repeated.\n\nFor answer he took a firmer hold, in one hand seizing my arm above the\nelbow, and gripping my shoulder with the other so tightly that, through\nmy flimsy covering, his strong fingers bruised me so severely that in a\ncalmer moment I would have squirmed and cried out with pain.\n\n\"How dare you touch me!\" He drew me so closely to him that, through his\nthin shirt--the only garment on the upper part of his figure--I could\nfeel the heat of his body, and his big heart beating wildly.\n\nAt last! at last! I had waked this calm silent giant into life. After\nmany an ineffectual struggle I had got at a little real love or passion,\nor call it by any name--something wild and warm and splendidly alive\nthat one could feel, the most thrilling, electric, and exquisite\nsensation known.\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed the situation, but did not let this appear. A\nminute or two passed and he did not speak.\n\n\"Mr Beecham, I'll trouble you to explain yourself. How dare you lay your\nhands upon me?\"\n\n\"Explain!\" he breathed rather than spoke, in a tone of concentrated\nfury. \"I'll make _you_ explain, and I'll do what I like with you. I'll\ntouch you as much as I think fit. I'll throw you over the fence if _you_\ndon't explain to _my_ satisfaction.\"\n\n\"What is there that I can explain?\"\n\n\"Explain your conduct with other men. How dare you receive their\nattentions and be so friendly with them!\"\n\n\"How dare you speak to me like that! I reserve the right of behaving as\nI please without your permission.\"\n\n\"I won't have a girl with my engagement ring on her finger going on as\nyou do. I think I have a right to complain, for I could get any amount\nof splendid women in every way to wear it for me, and behave themselves\nproperly too,\" he said fiercely.\n\nI tossed my head defiantly, saying, \"Loose your hold of me, and I'll\nquickly explain matters to my own satisfaction and yours, Harold\nBeecham.\"\n\nHe let me go, and I stepped a pace or two away from him, drew the costly\nring from my finger, and, with indifference and contempt, tossed it to\nhis feet, where the juice of crushed strawberries was staining the\nground, and facing him, said mockingly:\n\n\"Now, speak to the girl who wears your engagement ring, for I'll degrade\nmyself by wearing it no more. If you think I think you as great a catch\nas you think yourself, just because you have a little money, you are a\ntrifle mistaken, Mr Beecham, that is all. Ha ha ha! So you thought you\nhad a right to lecture me as your future slave! Just fancy! I never had\nthe slightest intention of marrying you. You were so disgustingly\nconceited that I have been attempting to rub a little of it out of you.\nMarry you! Ha ha! Because the social laws are so arranged that a woman's\nonly sphere is marriage, and because they endeavour to secure a man who\ncan give them a little more ease, you must not run away with the idea\nthat it is yourself they are angling for, when you are only the\nbothersome appendage with which they would have to put up, for the sake\nof your property. And you must not think that because some women will\nmarry for a home they all will. I trust I have explained to your\nsatisfaction, Mr Beecham. Ha ha ha!\"\n\nThe jealous rage had died out of his face and was succeeded by trembling\nand a pallor so ghastly, that I began to have a little faith in\ndescriptions of love which I had hitherto ridiculed.\n\n\"Are you in earnest?\" he asked in a deadly calm voice.\n\n\"Most emphatically I am.\"\n\n\"Then all I can say is that I haven't much respect for you, Miss Melvyn.\nI always considered that there were three classes of women--one, that\nwould marry a blackfellow if he had money; another, that were shameless\nflirts, and who amuse themselves by flirting and disgracing the name of\nwoman; and a third class that were pure and true, on whom a man could\nstake his life and whom he could worship. I thought you belonged to this\nclass, but I have been mistaken. I know you always try to appear\nheartless and worthless, but I fancied it was only your youth and\nmischief, and imagined you were good underneath; but I have been\nmistaken,\" he repeated with quiet contempt.\n\nHis face had regained its natural colour, and the well-cut pleasant\nmouth, clearly seen beneath the soft drooping moustache, had hardened\ninto a sullen line which told me he would never be first to seek\nreconciliation--not even to save his life.\n\n\"Bah!\" I exclaimed sarcastically. \"It appears that we all labour under\ndelusions. Go and get a beautiful woman to wear your ring and your name.\nOne that will be able to say yes and no at the right time; one who will\nknow how to dress properly; one who wouldn't for the world do anything\nthat other women did not also; one who will know where to buy the best\ngroceries and who will readily sell herself to you for your wealth.\nThat's the sort of woman that suits men, and there are plenty of them;\nprocure one, and don't bother with me. I am too small and silly, and\nhave nothing to recommend me. I fear it speaks little for your sense or\ntaste that you ever thought of me. Ta-ta, Mr Beecham,\" I said over my\nshoulder with a mocking smile, and walked away.\n\nWhen about half-way down the orchard reflection pulled me up shortly\nunder an apple-tree.\n\nI had said what I had said because, feeling bitter for the want of love,\nand because full of pain myself, I rejoiced with a sort of revenge to\nsee the same feeling flash across another's face. But now I was cool,\nand, forgetting myself, thought of Harold.\n\nI had led him on because his perpetually calm demeanour had excited in\nme a desire to test if it were possible to disturb him. I had thought\nhim incapable of emotion, but he had proved himself a man of strong and\ndeep emotion; might he not also be capable of feeling--of love? He had\nnot been mean or nasty in his rage, and his anger had been righteous. By\naccepting his proposal of marriage, I had given him the right of\nexpressing his objection to any of my actions of which he disapproved. I\non my part had the liberty of trying to please him or of dissolving our\nengagement. Perhaps in some cases there was actually something more than\nwounded vanity when a man's alleged love was rejected or spurned. Harold\nhad seemed to suffer, to really experience keen disappointment. I was\nclearly in the wrong, and had been unwomanly beyond a doubt, as,\ngranting that Harold Beecham was conceited, what right had I to\nconstitute myself his judge or to take into my own hands the\nresponsibility of correcting him? I felt ashamed of my conduct; I was\nsorry to have hurt any one's feelings. Moreover, I cannot bear to be at\nill-will with my fellows, and am ever the first to give in after having\nquarrelled. It is easier than sulking, and it always makes the other\nparty so self-complacent that it is amusing as well as convenient,\nand--and--and--I found I was very, very fond of Harold Beecham.\n\nI crept noiselessly up the orchard. He had his back to me, and had moved\nto where a post of the fence was peeping out among the greenery. He had\nhis elbow placed thereon, and his forehead resting on his hand. His\nattitude expressed dejection. Maybe he was suffering the torture of a\nbroken ideal.\n\nHis right hand hung limply by his side. I do not think he heard me\napproach.\n\nMy heart beat quickly, and a fear that he would snub me caused me to\npause. Then I nerved myself with the thought that it would be only fair\nif he did. I had been rude to him, and he had a right to play\ntit-for-tat if he felt so disposed. I expected my action to be spurned\nor ignored, so very timidly slipped my fingers into his palm. I need not\nhave been nervous, for the strong brown hand, which had never been known\nto strike a cowardly blow, completely enfolded mine in a gentle\ncaressing clasp.\n\n\"Mr Beecham, Harold, I am so sorry I was so unwomanly, and said such\nhorrible things. Will you forgive me, and let us start afresh?\" I\nmurmured. All flippancy, bitterness, and amusement had died out of me; I\nwas serious and in earnest. This must have expressed itself in my eyes,\nfor Harold, after gazing searchingly right there for a time, seemed\nsatisfied, and his mouth relaxed to its habitually lovable expression as\nhe said:\n\n\"Are you in earnest? Well, that is something more like the little\nwoman.\"\n\n\"Yes, I'm in earnest. Can you forgive me?\"\n\n\"There is nothing to forgive, as I'm sure you didn't mean and don't\nremember the blood curdling sentiments you aired.\"\n\n\"But I did mean them in one sort of a way, and didn't in another. Let us\nstart afresh.\"\n\n\"How do you mean to start afresh?\"\n\n\"I mean for us to be chums again.\"\n\n\"Oh, chums!\" he said impatiently; \"I want to be something more.\"\n\n\"Well, I will be something more if you will try to make me,\" I replied.\n\n\"How? What do you mean?\"\n\n\"I mean you never try to make me fond of you. You have never uttered one\nword of love to me.\"\n\n\"Why, bless me!\" he ejaculated in surprise.\n\n\"It's a fact. I have only flirted to try and see if you cared, but you\ndidn't care a pin.\"\n\n\"Why, bless me, didn't you say I was not to show any affection yet\nawhile? And talk about not caring--why, I have felt fit to kill you and\nmyself many a time the last fortnight, you have tormented me so; but I\nhave managed to keep myself within bounds till now. Will you wear my\nring again?\"\n\n\"Oh no; and you must not say I am flirting if I cannot manage to love\nyou enough to marry you, but I will try my best.\"\n\n\"Don't you love me, Syb? I have thought of nothing else but you night\nand day since I saw you first. Can it be possible that you don't care a\nstraw for me?\" and a pained expression came upon his face.\n\n\"Oh, Harold, I'm afraid I very nearly love you, but don't hurry me too\nmuch! You can think me sort of secretly engaged to you if you like, but\nI won't take your ring. Keep it till we see how we get on.\" I looked for\nit, and finding it a few steps away, gave it to him.\n\n\"Can you really trust me again after seeing me get in such a vile beast\nof a rage? I often do that, you know,\" he said.\n\n\"Believe me, Hal, I liked it so much I wish you would get in a rage\nagain. I can't bear people who never let themselves go, or rather, who\nhave nothing in them to carry them away--they cramp and bore me.\"\n\n\"But I have a frightful temper. Satan only knows what I will do in it\nyet. Would you not be frightened of me?\"\n\n\"No fear,\" I laughed; \"I would defy you.\"\n\n\"A tomtit might as well defy me,\" he said with amusement.\n\n\"Well, big as you are, a tomtit having such superior facilities for\ngetting about could easily defy you,\" I replied.\n\n\"Yes, unless it was caged,\" he said.\n\n\"But supposing you never got it caged,\" I returned.\n\n\"Syb, what do you mean?\"\n\n\"What could I mean?\"\n\n\"I don't know. There are always about four or five meanings in what you\nsay.\"\n\n\"Oh, thanks, Mr Beecham! You must be very astute. I am always thankful\nwhen I am able to dish one meaning out of my idle gabble.\"\n\nThe glorious summer day had fallen asleep on the bosom of the horizon,\nand twilight had merged into dusk, as, picking up the basket, Harold and\nI returned cherry- and strawberry-less to the tennis court. The players\nhad just ceased action, and the gentlemen were putting on their coats.\nHarold procured his, and thrust his arms into it, while we were attacked\non all sides by a flood of banter.\n\nMy birthday tea was a great success, and after it was done we enjoyed\nourselves in the drawing-room. Uncle Jay-Jay handed me a large box,\nsaying it contained a present. Everyone looked on with interest while I\nhurriedly opened it, when they were much amused to see--nothing but a\ndoll and materials to make it clothes! I was much disappointed, but\nuncle said it would be more in my line to play with that than to worry\nabout tramps and politics.\n\nI took care to behave properly during the evening, and when the\ngood-byes were in full swing had an opportunity of a last word with\nHarold, he stooping to hear me whisper:\n\n\"Now that I know you care, I will not annoy you any more by flirting.\"\n\n\"Don't talk like that. I was only mad for the moment. Enjoy yourself as\nmuch as you like. I don't want you to be like a nun. I'm not quite so\nselfish as that. When I look at you and see how tiny you are, and how\nyoung, I feel it is brutal to worry you at all, and you don't detest me\naltogether for getting in such an infernal rage?\"\n\n\"No. That is the very thing I liked. Good night!\"\n\n\"Good night,\" he replied, taking both my hands in his. \"You are the best\nlittle woman in the world, and I hope we will spend all your other\nbirthdays together.\"\n\n\"It's to be hoped you've said something to make Harry a trifle sweeter\nthan he was this afternoon,\" said Goodchum. Then it was:\n\n\"Good night, Mrs Bossier! Good night, Harry! Good night, Archie! Good\nnight, Mr Goodchum! Good-bye, Miss Craddock! Ta-ta, Miss Melvyn! So\nlong, Jay-Jay! Good-bye, Mrs Bell! Goodbye, Miss Goodjay! Good night,\nMiss Melvyn! Good night, Mr Goodjay! Good night, Mrs Bossier! Good-bye,\nMiss Melvyn! Good night all!\"\n\n\n\nI sat long by my writing-table that night--thinking long, long thoughts,\nfoolish thoughts, sad ones, merry ones, old-headed thoughts, and the\nsweet, sweet thoughts of youth and love. It seemed to me that men were\nnot so invincible and invulnerable as I had imagined them--it appeared\nthey had feeling and affections after all.\n\nI laughed a joyous little laugh, saying, \"Hal, we are quits,\" when, on\ndisrobing for the night, I discovered on my soft white shoulders and\narms--so susceptible to bruises--many marks, and black.\n\nIt had been a very happy day for me.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR\n\nThou Knowest Not What a Day May Bring Forth\n\n\nThe next time I saw Harold Beecham was on Sunday the 13th of December.\nThere was a hammock swinging under a couple of trees in an enclosure,\nhalf shrubbery, partly orchard and vegetable garden, skirting the road.\nIn this I was gently swinging to and fro, and very much enjoying an\ninteresting book and some delicious gooseberries, and seeing Harold\napproaching pretended to be asleep, to see if he would kiss me. But no,\nhe was not that style of man. After tethering his horse to the fence and\nvaulting himself over it, he shook me and informed me I was as sound\nasleep as a log, and had required no end of waking.\n\nMy hair tumbled down. I accused him of disarranging it, and ordered him\nto repair the damage. He couldn't make out what was the matter with it,\nonly that \"It looks a bit dotty.\"\n\n\"Men are queer creatures,\" I returned. \"They have the most wonderful\nbrains in some ways, but in little things they are as stupid as owls. It\nis no trouble to them to master geology, mineralogy, anatomy, and other\nthings, the very name of which gives me a headache. They can see through\npolitics, mature mighty water reservoir schemes, and manage five\nstations at once, but they couldn't sew on a button or fix one's hair to\nsave their life.\"\n\nI cannot imagine how the news had escaped me, for the story with which\nHarold Beecham surprised and startled me on that long hot afternoon had\nbeen common talk for some time.\n\nHe had come to Caddagat purposely to explain his affairs to me, and\nstated as his reason for not having done so earlier that he had waited\nuntil the last moment thinking he might pull himself up.\n\nBusiness to me is a great mystery, into which I haven't the slightest\ndesire to penetrate. I have no brains in that direction,--so will not\nattempt to correctly reproduce all that Harold Beecham told me on that\nafternoon while leaning against a tree at my feet and looking down at me\nas I reclined in the hammock.\n\nThere was great mention of bogus bonds, bad investments, liabilities and\nassets and personal estates, and of a thing called an official\nassignee--whatever that is--voluntary sequestration, and a jargon of\nsuch terms that were enough to mither a Barcoo lawyer.\n\nThe gist of the matter, as I gathered it, was that Harold Beecham,\nlooked upon as such a \"lucky beggar\", and envied as a pet of fortune,\nhad been visited by an unprecedented run of crushing misfortunes. He had\nnot been as rich and sound in position as the public had imagined him to\nbe. The failure of a certain bank two or three years previously had\ngiven him a great shaking. The tick plague had ruined him as regarded\nhis Queensland property, and the drought had made matters nearly as bad\nfor him in New South Wales. The burning of his wool last year, and the\nfailure of the agents in whose hands he had placed it, this had pushed\nhim farther into the mire, and now the recent \"going bung\" of a building\nsociety--his sole remaining prop--had run him entirely ashore.\n\nHe had sequestrated his estate, and as soon as practicable was going\nthrough the courts as an insolvent. The personal estate allowed him from\nthe debris of his wealth he intended to settle on his aunts, and he\nhoped it might be sufficient to support them. Himself, he had the same\nprospects as the boundary-riders on Five-Bob Downs.\n\nI had nothing to say. Not that Harold was a much-to-be-pitied man when\none contrasted his lot with that of millions of his fellows as deserving\nas he; but, on the other hand, considering he had been reared in wealth\nand as the master of it since his birth, to be suddenly rendered equal\nwith a labourer was pretty hard lines.\n\n\"Oh, Harold, I am so sorry for you!\" I managed to stammer at last.\n\n\"Don't worry about me. There's many a poor devil, crippled and ill,\nthough rolling in millions, who would give all his wealth to stand in my\nboots today,\" he said, drawing his splendid figure to its full height,\nwhile a look of stern pride settled on the strong features. Harold\nBeecham was not a whimpering cur. He would never tell anyone his\nfeelings on the subject; but such a sudden reverse of fortune, tearing\nfrom him even his home, must have been a great blow to him.\n\n\"Syb, I have been expecting this for some years; now that it is done\nwith, it is a sort of grim relief. The worst of all is that I've had to\ngive up all hope of winning you. That is the worst of all. If you didn't\ncare for me when I was thought to be in a position to give you all that\ngirls like, you could never look at me now that I'm a pauper. I only\nhope you will get some fellow who will make you as happy as I would have\ntried to had you let me.\"\n\nI sat and wondered at the marvellous self-containment of the man before\nme. With this crash impending, just imagine the worry he must have gone\nthrough! But never had the least suspicion that he was troubled found\nbetrayal on his brow.\n\n\"Good-bye, Syb,\" he said; \"though I'm a nobody now, if I could ever be\nof use to you, don't be afraid to ask me.\"\n\nI remember him wringing the limp hand I mechanically stretched out to\nhim and then slowly revaulting the fence. The look of him riding slowly\nalong with his broad shoulders drooping despondently waked me to my\nsenses. I had been fully engrossed with the intelligence of Harold's\nmisfortune--that I was of sufficient importance to concern him in any\nway had not entered my head; but it suddenly dawned on me that Harold\nhad said that I was, and he was not in the habit of uttering idle\nnothings.\n\nWhile fortune smiled on him I had played with his manly love, but now\nthat she frowned had let him go without even a word of friendship. I had\nbeen poor myself, and knew what awaited him in the world. He would find\nthat they who fawned on him most would be first to turn their backs on\nhim now. He would be rudely disillusioned regarding the fables of love\nand friendship, and would become cynical, bitter, and sceptical of there\nbeing any disinterested good in human nature. Suffering the cold\nheart-weariness of this state myself, I felt anxious at any price to\nsave Harold Beecham from a like fate. It would be a pity to let one so\nyoung be embittered in that way.\n\nThere was a short cut across the paddocks to a point of the road where\nhe would pass; and with these thoughts flashing through my mind, hatless\nand with flying hair, I ran as fast as I could, scrambling up on the\nfence in a breathless state just as he had passed.\n\n\"Hal, Hal!\" I called. \"Come back, come back! I want you.\"\n\nHe turned his horse slowly.\n\n\"Well, Syb, what is it?\"\n\n\"Oh, Hal, dear Hal! I was thinking too much to say anything; but you\nsurely don't think I'd be so mean as to care a pin whether you are rich\nor poor--only for your own sake? If you really want me, I will marry you\nwhen I am twenty-one if you are as poor as a crow.\"\n\n\"It is too good to be true. I thought you didn't care for me. Sybylla,\nwhat do you mean?\"\n\n\"Just what I say,\" I replied, and without further explanation, jumping\noff the fence I ran back as fast as I had come.\n\nWhen half-way home I stopped, turned, looked, and saw Harold cantering\nsmartly homewards, and heard him whistling a merry tune as he went.\n\nAfter all, men are very weak and simple in some ways.\n\nI laughed long and sardonically, apostrophizing myself thus:\n\n\"Sybylla Penelope Melvyn, your conceit is marvellous and unparalleled!\nSo you actually imagined that you were of sufficient importance to\nassist a man through life--a strong, healthy young man too, standing six\nfeet three and a half in his socks, a level-headed business man, a man\nof high connections, spotless character, and influential friends, an\nexperienced bushman, a man of sense, and, above all, a man--a man! The\nworld was made for men.\n\n\"Ha ha! You, Sybylla, thought this! You, a chit in your teens, an ugly,\npoor, useless, unimportant, little handful of human flesh, and, above,\nor rather below, all, a woman--only a woman! It would indeed be a\ndepraved and forsaken man who would need your services as a stay and\nsupport! Ha ha! The conceit of you!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE\n\nBecause?\n\n\nThe Beechams were vacating Five-Bob almost immediately--before\nChristmas. Grannie, aunt Helen, and uncle Jay-Jay went down to say\ngood-bye to the ladies, who were very heartbroken about being uprooted\nfrom Five-Bob, but they approved of their nephew settling things at once\nand starting on a clean sheet. They intended taking up their\nresidence--hiding themselves, they termed it--in Melbourne. Harold would\nbe detained in Sydney some time during the settling of his affairs,\nafter which he intended to take anything that turned up. He had been\noffered the management of Five-Bob by those in authority, but could not\nbring himself to accept managership where he had been master. His great\ndesire, now that Five-Bob was no longer his, was to get as far away from\nold associations as possible.\n\nHe had seen his aunts off, superintended the muster of all stock on the\nplace, dismissed all the female and most of the male employees, and\nsurrendered the reins of government, and as Harold Augustus Beecham,\nboss of Five-Bob, on Monday, the 21st of December 1896, was leaving the\ndistrict for ever. On Sunday, the 20th of December, he came to bid us\ngood-bye and to arrive at an understanding with me concerning what I had\nsaid to him the Sunday before. Grannie, strange to say, never suspected\nthat there was likely to be anything between us. Harold was so\nundemonstrative, and had always come and gone as he liked at Caddagat:\nshe overlooked the possibility of his being a lover, and in our\nintercourse allowed us almost the freedom of sister and brother or\ncousins.\n\nOn this particular afternoon, after we had talked to grannie for a\nlittle while, knowing that he wished to interview me, I suggested that\nhe should come up the orchard with me and get some gooseberries. Without\ndemur from anybody we set off, and were scarcely out of hearing before\nHarold asked me had I really meant what I said.\n\n\"Certainly,\" I replied. \"That is, if you really care for me, and think\nit wise to choose me of all my sex.\"\n\nEre he put it in words I read his answer in the clear brown eyes bent\nupon me.\n\n\"Syb, you know what I feel and would like, but I think it would be mean\nof me to allow you to make such a sacrifice.\"\n\nI knew I was not dealing with a booby, but with a sensible clear-sighted\nman, and so studied to express myself in a way which would not for an\ninstant give him the impression that I was promising to marry him\nbecause--what I don't know and it doesn't matter much, but I said:\n\n\"Hal, don't you think it is a little selfish of you to want to throw me\nover just because you have lost your money? You are young, healthy, have\ngood character and influential connections, and plenty of good practical\nability and sense, so, surely, you will know no such thing as failure if\nyou meet the world bravely. Go and be the man you are; and if you fail,\nwhen I am twenty-one I will marry you, and we will help each other. I am\nyoung and strong, and am used to hard work, so poverty will not alarm me\nin the least. If you want me, I want you.\n\n\"Syb, you are such a perfect little brick that I couldn't be such a\nbeggarly cur as to let you do that. I knew you were as true as steel\nunder your funny little whims and contrariness; and could you really\nlove me now that I am poor?\"\n\nI replied with vigour:\n\n\"Do you think I am that sort, that cares for a person only because he\nhas a little money? Why! that is the very thing I am always preaching\nagainst. If a man was a lord or a millionaire I would not have him if I\nloved him not, but I would marry a poor cripple if I loved him. It\nwasn't because you owned Five-Bob Downs that I liked you, but because\nyou have a big heart in which one would have room to get warm, and\nbecause you are true, and because you are kind and big and--\" Here I\ncould feel my voice getting shaky, and being afraid I would make a fool\nof myself by crying, I left off.\n\n\"Syb, I will try and fix matters up a bit, and will claim you in that\ntime if I have a home.\"\n\n\"Claim me, home or not, if you are so disposed, but I will make this\ncondition. Do not tell anyone we are engaged, and remember you are\nperfectly free. If you see a woman you like more than me, promise me on\nyour sacred word that you will have none of those idiotic unjust ideas\nof keeping true to me. Promise.\"\n\n\"Yes, I will promise,\" he said easily, thinking then, no doubt, as many\na one before him has thought, that he would never be called upon to\nfulfil his word.\n\n\"I will promise in return that I will not look at another man in a\nmatrimonial way until the four years are up, so you need not be jealous\nand worry yourself; for, Hal, you can trust me, can you not?\"\n\nTaking my hand in his and looking at me with a world of love in his\neyes, which moved me in spite of myself, he said:\n\n\"I could trust you in every way to the end of the world.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Harold. What we have said is agreed upon--that is, of\ncourse, as things appear now: if anything turns up to disturb this\narrangement it is not irrevocable in the least degree, and we can lay\nout more suitable plans. Four years will not be long, and I will be more\nsensible at the end of that time--that is, of course, if I ever have any\nsense. We will not write or have any communication, so you will be\nperfectly free if you see anyone you like better than me to go in and\nwin. Do you agree?\"\n\n\"Certainly; any little thing like that you can settle according to your\nfancy. I'm set up as long as I get you one way or another, that's all I\nwant. It was a bit tough being cleared out from all the old ways, but if\nI have you to stand by me it will be a great start. Say what you said\nlast Sunday, again. Syb, say you will be my wife.\"\n\nI had expected him to put it in that way, and believing in doing all or\nnothing, had laid out that I would put my hand in his and promise what\nhe asked. But now the word wife finished me up. I was very fond of\nHarold--fond to such an extent that had I a fortune I would gladly have\ngiven it all to him: I felt capable of giving him a life of servitude,\nbut I loved him--big, manly, lovable, wholesome Harold--from the crown\nof his head to the sole of his foot he was good in my sight, but lacking\nin that power over me which would make me desirous of being the mother\nof his children.\n\nAs for explaining my feelings to him--ha! He would laughingly call them\none of my funny little whims. With his orthodox, practical, plain,\ncommonsense views of these things, he would not understand me. What was\nthere to understand? Only that I was queer and different from other\nwomen. But he was waiting for me to speak. I had put my hand to the\nplough and could not turn back. I could not use the word wife, but I put\nmy hand in his, looked at him steadily, and said--\n\n\"Harold. I meant what I said last Sunday. If you want me--if I am of any\nuse to you--I will marry you when I attain my majority.\"\n\nHe was satisfied.\n\n\n\nHe bade us good-bye early that afternoon, as he intended departing from\nFive-Bob when the morrow was young, and had two or three little matters\nto attend to previous to his departure.\n\nI accompanied him a little way, he walking and leading his horse. We\nparted beneath the old willow-tree.\n\n\"Good-bye, Harold. I mean all I have said.\"\n\nI turned my face upwards; he stooped and kissed me once--only once--one\nlight, gentle, diffident kiss. He looked at me long and intently without\nsaying a word, then mounted his horse, raised his hat, and rode away.\n\nI watched him depart along the white dusty road, looking like a long\nsnake in the glare of the summer sun, until it and he who travelled\nthereon disappeared among the messmate- and hickory-trees forming the\nhorizon.\n\nI stood gazing at the hills in the distance on which the blue dreaming\nmists of evening were gathering, until tears stole down my cheeks.\n\nI was not given to weeping. What brought them? I hardly knew. It was not\nbecause Harold was leaving, though I would miss him much. Was it because\nI was disappointed in love? I persuaded myself that. I loved Harold as\nmuch as I could ever love anyone, and I could not forsake him now that\nhe needed me. But, but, but, I did not want to marry, and I wished that\nHarold had asked anything of me but that, because--because, I don't know\nwhat, and presently felt ashamed for being such a selfish coward that I\ngrudged to make a little sacrifice of my own inclinations to help a\nbrother through life.\n\n\n\n\"I used to feel sure that Harry meant to come up to the scratch, but I\nsuppose he's had plenty to keep him going lately without bothering his\nhead about a youngster in short frocks and a pigtail,\" remarked uncle\nJay-Jay that night.\n\n\n\n\"Well, Sybylla, poor Harry has gone: we will all--even you\nincluded--miss him very much, I am sure. I used to think that he cared\nfor you. It may be that he has not spoken to us on account of his\nfinancial failure, and it may be that I made a mistake,\" said aunt Helen\nwhen she was bidding me good night.\n\nI held my peace.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER TWENTY-SIX\n\nBoast Not Thyself of Tomorrow\n\n\nWe felt the loss of the Beechams very, very much. It was sad to think of\nFive-Bob--pleasant, hospitable Five-Bob--as shut up, with no one but a\nsolitary caretaker there pending the settling of the Beecham insolvency;\nwith flowers running to seed unheeded in the wide old garden, grass\nyellowing on the lawns, fruit wasting in wain-loads in the great\norchard, kennels, stables, fowl-houses, and cow-yards empty and\ndeserted. But more than all, we missed the quiet, sunburnt, gentlemanly,\nyoung giant whose pleasant countenance and strapping figure were always\nwelcome at Caddagat.\n\nFortunately, Christmas preparations gave us no rest for the soles of our\nfeet, and thus we had little time to moon about such things: in\naddition, uncle Jay-Jay was preparing for a trip, and fussed so that the\nwhole place was kept in a state of ferment.\n\nWe had fun, feasting, and company to no end on Christmas Day. There were\nbank clerks and young fellows out of offices from Gool-Gool, jackeroos\nand governesses in great force from neighbouring holdings, and we had a\nmerry time.\n\nOn Boxing Day uncle Jay-Jay set out on a tour to New Zealand, intending\nto combine business with pleasure, as he meant to bring back some stud\nstock if he could make a satisfactory bargain. Boxing Day had fallen on\na Saturday that year, and the last of our guests departed on Sunday\nmorning. It was the first time we had had any quietude for many weeks,\nso in the afternoon I went out to swing in my hammock and meditate upon\nthings in general. Taking with me a bountiful supply of figs, apricots,\nand mulberries, I laid myself out for a deal of enjoyment in the cool\ndense shade under the leafy kurrajong- and cedar-trees.\n\nTo begin with, Harold Beecham was gone, and I missed him at every turn.\nI need not worry about being engaged to be married, as four years was a\nlong, long time. Before that Harold might take a fancy to someone else,\nand leave me free; or he might die, or I might die, or we both might\ndie, or fly, or cry, or sigh, or do one thing or another, and in the\nmeantime that was not the only thing to occupy my mind: I had much to\ncontemplate with joyful anticipation.\n\nTowards the end of February a great shooting and camping party,\norganized by grannie, was to take place. Aunt Helen, grannie, Frank\nHawden, myself, and a number of other ladies and gentlemen, were going\nto have ten days or a fortnight in tents among the blue hills in the\ndistance, which held many treasures in the shape of lyrebirds, musk,\nferns, and such scenery as would make the thing perfection. After this\nauntie and I were to have our three months' holiday in Sydney, where,\nwith Everard Grey in the capacity of showman, we were to see everything\nfrom Manly to Parramatta, the Cyclorama to the Zoo, the theatres to the\nchurches, the restaurants to the jails, and from Anthony Hordern's to\nPaddy's Market. Who knows what might happen then? Everard had promised\nto have my talents tested by good judges. Might it not be possible for\nme to attain one of my ambitions--enter the musical profession? joyful\ndream! Might I not be able to yet assist Harold in another way than\nmatrimony?\n\nYes, life was a pleasant thing to me now. I forgot all my wild\nunattainable ambitions in the little pleasures of everyday life. Such a\nthing as writing never entered my head. I occasionally dreamt out a\nlittle yarn which, had it appeared on paper, would have brimmed over\nwith pleasure and love--in fact, have been redolent of life as I found\nit. It was nice to live in comfort, and among ladies and\ngentlemen--people who knew how to conduct themselves properly, and who\npaid one every attention without a bit of fear of being twitted with\n\"laying the jam on\".\n\nI ate another fig and apricot, a mulberry or two, and was interrupted in\nthe perusal of my book by the clatter of galloping hoofs approaching\nalong the road. I climbed on to the fence to see who it could be who was\ncoming at such a breakneck pace. He pulled the rein opposite me, and I\nrecognized a man from Dogtrap. He was in his shirt-sleeves; his horse\nwas all in a lather, and its scarlet nostrils were wide open, and its\nsides heaving rapidly.\n\n\"I say, miss, hunt up the men quickly, will you?\" he said hurriedly.\n\"There's a tremenjous fire on Wyambeet, and we're short-handed. I'm\ngoin' on to knock them up at Bimbalong.\"\n\n\"Hold hard,\" I replied. \"We haven't a man on the place, only Joe\nSlocombe, and I heard him say he would ride down the river and see what\nthe smoke was about; so he will be there. Mr Hawden and the others have\ngone out for the day. You go back to the fire at once; I'll rouse them\nup at Birribalong.\"\n\n\"Right you are, miss. Here's a couple of letters. My old moke flung a\nshoe and went dead lame at Dogtrap; an' wile I was saddlun another, Mrs\nButler stuffed 'em in me pocket.\"\n\nHe tossed them over the fence, and, wheeling his mount, galloped the way\nhe had come. The letters fell, address upwards, on the ground--one to\nmyself and one to grannie, both in my mother's handwriting. I left them\nwhere they lay. The main substance of mother's letters to me was a hope\nthat I was a better girl to my grannie than I had been to her--a\nsentiment which did not interest me.\n\n\"Where are you off to?\" inquired grannie, as I rushed through the house.\n\nI explained.\n\n\"What horse are you going to take?\"\n\n\"Old Tadpole. He's the only one available.\"\n\n\"Well, you be careful and don't push him too quickly up that pinch by\nFlea Creek, or he might drop dead with you. He's so fat and old.\"\n\n\"All right,\" I replied, snatching a bridle and running up the orchard,\nwhere old Tadpole had been left in case of emergency. I clapped a\nside-saddle on his back, a hat on my head, jumped on just as I was, and\ngalloped for my life in the direction of Bimbalong, seven miles distant.\nI eased my horse a little going up Flea Creek pinch, but with this delay\nreached my destination in half an hour, and sent the men galloping in\nthe direction of the fire. I lingered for afternoon tea, and returned at\nmy leisure.\n\nIt was sundown when I got in sight of Caddagat. Knowing the men would\nnot be home for some time, I rode across the paddock to yard the cows. I\ndrove them home and penned the calves, unsaddled my horse and returned\nhim to the orchard, then stood upon the hillside and enjoyed the scene.\nIt had been a fearfully hot day, with a blasting, drought-breathed wind;\nbut the wind had dropped to sleep with the sunlight, and now the air had\ncooled. Blue smoke wreathed hill and hollow like a beauteous veil. I had\ntraversed drought-baked land that afternoon, but in the immediate\nvicinity of Caddagat house there was no evidence of an unkind season.\nIrrigation had draped the place with beauty, and I stood ankle-deep in\nclover. Oh, how I loved the old irregularly built house, with here and\nthere a patch of its low iron roof peeping out of a mass of greenery,\nflowers, and fruit--the place where I was born--home! Save for the\nmurmur of the creek, the evening was wrapped in silence--sweet-breathed,\nbalmy-browed, summer quietude. I stretched out my hand and stained my\nfingers, next my lips and teeth, with the sweet dark fruit of a\nmulberry-tree beside me. The shadows deepened; I picked up my saddle,\nand, carrying it housewards, put it in its place in the harness-room\namong the fig- and apricot-trees--laden to breaking point with ripe and\nripening fruit. The two servant girls had departed on their Christmas\nholiday that morning, so grannie and auntie were the only members of the\nfamily at home. I could not see or hear them anywhere, so, presuming\nthey were out walking, I washed my hands, lit a lamp, and sat down to my\ntea, where it had been left for me on the dining-table. I\nremembered--wonderful aberration from my usual thoughtlessness--that the\nbook I had left in the hammock had a beautiful cover which the dew would\nspoil, so I left my tea to bring it in. Two little white squares struck\nmy eye in the gathering dusk. I picked them up also, and, bringing them\nto the light, opened the one addressed to me, and read:\n\n\nNo doubt what I have to write will not be very palatable to you; but it\nis time you gave up pleasuring and began to meet the responsibilities of\nlife. Your father is lazier if anything, and drinks more than ever. He\nhas got himself into great debt and difficulties, and would have been\nsold off again but for Peter M'Swat. You will remember Peter M'Swat?\nWell, he has been good enough to lend your father 500 pounds at 4 per\ncent, which means 20 pounds per year interest. Your father would have no\nmore idea of meeting this amount than a cat would have. But now I am\ncoming to the part of the matter which concerns you. Out of friendship\nto your father, Mr M'Swat is good enough to accept your services as\ngoverness to his children, in lieu of interest on the money. I have told\nhim you will be in Yarnung In Friday the 8th of January 1897, where he\nwill meet you. Be careful to remember the date. I am sorry I could not\ngive you more notice; but he wants his children to commence school as\nsoon as possible, and he deserves every consideration in the matter.\nPerhaps you will not find it as pleasant as Caddagat; but he has been\nvery good, and offers you a fair number of holidays, and what he will\ngive you is equal to 20 pounds. That is a lot in these times, when he\ncould easily get so many better girls than you are in every way for half\nthe money, and make your father pay the interest, and thereby be 10\npounds in pocket. You will have to help Mrs M'Swat with the work and\nsewing; but that will do you good, and I hope you will try hard to give\nevery satisfaction. I have also written to your grandmother.\n\n\nThat letter wiped away ever vestige of my appetite for the dainties\nbefore me. M'Swat's! Send--me--to M'Swat's! I could not believe it! It\nmust be a nightmare! M'Swat's!\n\nCertainly, I had never been there; but all those who had gave graphic\ndescriptions of the total ignorance of Mrs M'Swat. Why, the place was\nquite tabooed on account of its squalor and dirt!\n\nThe steel of my mother's letter entered my soul. Why had she not\nexpressed a little regret at the thing she was imposing on me? Instead,\nthere was a note of satisfaction running through her letter that she was\nable to put an end to my pleasant life at Caddagat. She always seemed to\ngrudge me any pleasure. I bitterly put it down as accruing from the\ncurse of ugliness, as, when mentioning Gertie, it was ever, \"I have let\nGertie go to such and such an entertainment. We could not very well\nafford it, but the poor little girl does not have many pleasures for her\nyears.\" I was smaller than Gertie, and only eleven months older; but to\nme it was \"You must think of something besides pleasure.\"\n\nThe lot of ugly girls is not joyful, and they must be possessed of\nnatures very absurdly sanguine indeed ever to hope for any enjoyment in\nlife.\n\nIt was cruel, base, horrible of my mother to send me to M'Swat's. I\nwould not go--not for 50 pounds a day! I would not go! I would not! not\nfor any consideration.\n\nI stamped about in a fever of impatience until grannie appeared, when I\nhanded both letters to her, and breathlessly awaited her verdict.\n\n\"Well, child, what do you say?\"\n\n\"Say? I won't go! I can't! I won't! Oh, grannie, don't send me there--I\nwould rather die.\"\n\n\"My dear child, I would not be willing to part with you under any\ncircumstances, but I cannot interfere between a mother and her child. I\nwould not have allowed any one to do it with me, and believe in acting\nthe same towards any other mother, even though she is my own daughter.\nHowever, there is time to get a reply before you would have to start, so\nI will write and see what can be done.\"\n\nThe dear old lady, with her prompt businesslike propensities, sat down\nand wrote there and then. I wrote also--pleaded with my mother against\nher decree, begged her to leave me at Caddagat, and assured her I could\nnever succeed at M'Swat's.\n\nI did not sleep that night, so arose betimes to await the first\ntraveller, whom I asked to post the letters.\n\nWe got an answer to them sooner than we expected--at least grannie did.\nMother did not deign to write to me, but in her letter to grannie I was\ndescribed as an abominably selfish creature, who would not consider her\nlittle brothers and sisters. I would never be any good; all I thought of\nwas idleness and ease. Most decidedly I could not get out of going to\nM'Swat's, as mother had given her word.\n\n\"I am sorry for you,\" said grannie, \"but it cannot be helped. You can\nstay there for two or three years, and then I can have you here again.\"\n\nI was inconsolable, and would not listen to reason. Ah! that uncle\nJay-Jay had been at home to rescue me from this. Then aunt Helen brought\nher arguments to bear upon me, and persuaded me to think it was\nnecessary for the benefit of my little brothers and sisters that I\nshould take up this burden, which I knew would be too much for me.\n\nIt was a great wrench to be torn away from Caddagat--from refinement and\ncomfort--from home! As the days till my departure melted away, how I\nwished that it were possible to set one's weight against the grim wheel\nof time and turn it back! Nights I did not sleep, but drenched my pillow\nwith tears. Ah, it was hard to leave grannie and aunt Helen, whom I\nworshipped, and turn my back on Caddagat!\n\nI suppose it is only a fancy born of the wild deep love I bear it, but\nto me the flowers seem to smell more sweetly there; and the shadows, how\nthey creep and curl! oh, so softly and caressingly around the quaint old\nplace, as the great sun sets amid the blue peaks; and the never-ceasing\nrush of the crystal fern-banked stream--I see and hear it now, and the\nsinking sun as it turns to a sheet of flame the mirror hanging in the\nbackyard in the laundry veranda, before which the station hands were\nwont to comb and wash themselves. Oh, the memories that crowd upon me!\nMethinks I can smell the roses that clamber up the veranda posts and\npeep over the garden gate. As I write my eyes grow misty, so that I\ncannot see the paper.\n\nThe day for my departure arrived--hot, 110 degrees in the shade. It was\na Wednesday afternoon. Frank Hawden was to take me as far as Gool-Gool\nthat evening, and see me on to the coach next day. I would arrive in\nYarnung about twelve or one o'clock on Thursday night, where, according\nto arrangement, Mr M'Swat would be waiting to take me to a hotel, thence\nto his home next day.\n\nMy trunks and other belongings were stowed in the buggy, to which the\nfat horses were harnessed. They stood beneath the dense shade of a\nsplendid kurrajong, and lazily flicked the flies off themselves while\nFrank Hawden held the reins and waited for me.\n\nI rushed frantically round the house taking a last look at nooks and\npictures dear to me, and then aunt Helen pressed my hand and kissed me,\nsaying:\n\n\"The house will be lonely without you, but you must brighten up, and I'm\nsure you will not find things half as bad as you expect them.\"\n\nI looked back as I went out the front gate, and saw her throw herself\ninto a chair on the veranda and cover her face with her hands. My\nbeautiful noble aunt Helen! I hope she missed me just a little, felt\njust one pang of parting, for I have not got over that parting yet.\n\nGrannie gave me a warm embrace and many kisses. I climbed on to the\nfront seat of the buggy beside my escort, he whipped the horses--a cloud\nof dust, a whirr of wheels, and we were gone--gone from Caddagat!\n\nWe crossed the singing stream: on either bank great bushes of\nblackthorn--last native flower of the season--put forth their wealth of\nmagnificent creamy bloom, its rich perfume floating far on the hot\nsummer air. How the sunlight blazed and danced and flickered on the\nfamiliar and dearly loved landscape! Over a rise, and the house was lost\nto view, then good-bye to the crystal creek. The trees of Five-Bob Downs\ncame within eye-range far away on our left. What merry nights I had\nspent there amid music, flowers, youth, light, love, and summer warmth,\nwhen the tide of life seemed full! Where now was Harold Beecham and the\nthirty or more station hands, who but one short month before had come\nand gone at his bidding, hailing him boss?\n\nIt was all over! My pleasant life at Caddagat was going into the past,\nfading as the hills which surrounded it were melting into a hazy line of\nblue.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN\n\nMy Journey\n\n\nThe coach was a big vehicle, something after the style of a bus, the\ntilt and seats running parallel with the wheels. At the rear end,\ninstead of a door, was a great tail-board, on the principle of a\nspring-cart. This was let down, and, after we scrambled over it into our\nseats, it was fixed half-mast, all the luggage piled thereon, and firmly\nroped into position. When this was completed, to any one on the ground\nonly the heads of passengers were visible above the pile. Had the coach\ncapsized we would have been in a nice fix, as the only means of exit was\nby crawling up through the back of the box-seat, which rose\nbreast-high--an awkward feat.\n\nFrank Hawden and I parted good friends. I leant out and waved my\nhandkerchief, until a bend of the road hid him from sight.\n\nIt was noon, the thermometer registered 112 degrees in the shade, and\nthe dust was simply awful. It rose in such thick grey clouds that often\nit was impossible to discern the team of five which pulled us, and there\nwas danger of colliding with passing vehicles. We were very much\ncrowded, there being sixteen passengers. When we settled down and got\nstarted, I discovered that I was the only representative of my sex, and\nthat I was sandwiched between a perky youth in his teens and a Chinaman,\nwhile a black fellow and a man with a red beard sat opposite. A member\nof Parliament, farther up the seat, who had been patronizing New Year's\nDay races in a portion of his electorate, bawled loudly to his companion\nabout \"the doin's of the 'Ouse\". In the perky youth I discovered a\nprofessional jockey; and when he found that I was a daughter of Dick\nMelvyn, the one-time great horse-breeder, he became very friendly. He\ngave me a couple of apples out of his tin box under the seat, from\nwhence he also produced his whip for my inspection, and was good enough\nto say:\n\n\"If you can't stand the stink of that bloomin' chow, miss, just change\nseats with me. I've knocked about, so that I can easy stand some tough\nsmells without much inconvenience.\"\n\nI cautioned him to talk lower for fear of hurting the Chinaman's\nfeelings: this amused him immensely. He laughed very much, and, leaning\nover to the red-bearded man, repeated the joke:\n\n\"I say, this young lady is afraid I might hurt the chow's feelin's.\nGolly! Fancy a bloomin' chow havin' any!\"\n\nThe other man also thought it a great joke. I changed seats with the\njockey, which put me beside a young gentleman of a literary turn of\nmind, with whom I had some conversation about books when the dust,\nrumble of wheels, and turf talk of my other neighbour permitted. They\nwere all very kind to me--gave me fruit, procured me drinks of water,\nand took turns in nursing a precious hat, for which, on account of the\ncrush, no safe place could be found among the other luggage.\n\nBefore we had gone half our journey the horses knocked up. All the men\nwere forced to walk up hills for miles and miles in the dust and heat,\nwhich did not conduce to their amiability, and many and caustic were the\nremarks and jokes made upon the driver. He wore out two whips upon his\nteam, until the labour and excessive heat sent the perspiration rolling\nin rivulets down his face, leaving muddy tracks in the thick coating of\ndust there. The jockey assisted with his loaded instrument of trade,\nsome of the passengers thrashed with sticks, and all swore under their\nbreath, while a passing bullock-driver used his whip with such deadly\neffect, that the sweat which poured off the poor beasts was mingled with\nblood.\n\n\"Why the deuce don't you have proper horses?\" demanded the red-bearded\npassenger.\n\nThe man explained that a ministerial party had chartered his best team\nto go on a tour of inspection to a mine; a brother coachman had been\n\"stuck up\" for horses, and borrowed a couple from him, whereupon he was\nforced to do with animals which had been turned out for a spell, and the\nheat and overloading accounted for a good part of the contretemps.\nHowever, we managed to catch our train, but had to rush for it without\nwaiting for refreshments. Nice articles we looked--our hair grey with\ndust, and our faces grimy. The men took charge of me as carefully as\nthough I had been specially consigned to their care. One procured my\nticket, another secured me a seat, while a third took charge of my\nluggage; and they were just as thoughtful when we had to change trains.\nOff we went. Grannie had packed me quite a large box full of dainties. I\nproduced it, the men provided drinks, and we had quite a pleasant\npicnic, with all the windows down to catch a little air.\n\nI love the rush and roar of the train, and wished on this occasion that\nit might go on and on for over, never giving me time to think or stop.\nBut, alas, at 1.20 we pulled up at Yarnung, where a man came inquiring\nfor a young lady named Melvyn. My fellow passengers collected my\nbelongings, and I got out.\n\n\"Good-bye, gentlemen; thank you very much for your kindness.\"\n\n\"Good-bye, miss; you're welcome. Some of us might meet again yet.\nTa-ta!\"\n\nA shriek, a jerk, and the great train rushed on into the night, leaving\nme there on the insignificant little platform, feeling how lonely and\nunhappy, no one knew or cared.\n\nMr M'Swat shouldered most of my luggage, I took the remainder, and we\ntrudged off in the dark without a word on either side. The publican had\ngiven M'Swat the key, so that we might enter without disturbing the\nhousehold, and he escorted me to a bedroom, where I tumbled into bed\nwith expedition.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT\n\nTo Life\n\n\nIt is indelibly imprinted on my memory in a manner which royal joy,\nfame, pleasure, and excitement beyond the dream of poets could never\nefface, not though I should be cursed with a life of five-score years. I\nwill paint it truthfully--letter for letter as it was.\n\nIt was twenty-six miles from Yarnung to Barney's Gap, as M'Swat's place\nwas named. He had brought a light wagonette and pair to convey me\nthither.\n\nAs we drove along, I quite liked my master. Of course, we were of\ncalibre too totally unlike ever to be congenial companions, but I\nappreciated his sound common sense in the little matters within his\nrange, and his bluntly straightforward, fairly good-natured, manner. He\nwas an utterly ignorant man, with small ideas according to the sphere\nwhich he fitted, and which fitted him; but he was \"a man for a' that,\nan' a' that\".\n\nHe and my father had been boys together. Years and years ago M'Swat's\nfather had been blacksmith on my father's station, and the little boys\nhad played together, and, in spite of their then difference in station,\nhad formed a friendship which lived and bore fruit at this hour. I\nwished that their youthful relations had been inimical, not friendly.\n\nWe left the pub in Yarnung at nine, and arrived at our destination\nsomewhere about two o'clock in the afternoon.\n\nI had waxed quite cheerful, and began to look upon the situation in a\nsensible light. It was necessary that I should stand up to the guns of\nlife at one time or another, and why not now? M'Swat's might not be so\nbad after all. Even if they were dirty, they would surely be willing to\nimprove if I exercised tact in introducing a few measures. I was not\nafraid of work, and would do many things. But all these ideas were\nknocked on the head, like a dairyman's surplus calves, when on entering\nBarney's Gap we descended a rough road to the house, which was built in\na narrow gully between two steep stony hills, which, destitute of grass,\nrose like grim walls of rock, imparting a desolate and prison-like\naspect.\n\nSix dogs, two pet lambs, two or three pigs, about twenty fowls, eight\nchildren which seemed a dozen, and Mrs M'Swat bundled out through the\nback door at our approach. Those children, not through poverty--M'Swat\nmade a boast of his substantial banking account--but on account of\nignorance and slatternliness, were the dirtiest urchins I have ever\nseen, and were so ragged that those parts of them which should have been\ncovered were exposed to view. The majority of them had red hair and wide\nhanging-open mouths. Mrs M'Swat was a great, fat, ignorant,\npleasant-looking woman, shockingly dirty and untidy. Her tremendous,\nflabby, stockingless ankles bulged over her unlaced hobnailed boots; her\ndress was torn and unbuttoned at the throat, displaying one of the\ndirtiest necks I have seen. It did not seem to worry her that the infant\nshe hold under her arm like a roll of cloth howled killingly, while the\nother little ones clung to her skirts, attempting to hide their heads in\nits folds like so many emus. She greeted me with a smacking kiss,\nconsigned the baby to the charge of the eldest child, a big girl of\nfourteen, and seizing upon my trunks as though they were feather-weight,\nwith heavy clodhopping step disappeared into the house with them.\nReturning, she invited me to enter, and following in her wake, I was\nfollowed by the children through the dirtiest passage into the dirtiest\nroom, to sit upon the dirtiest chair, to gaze upon the other dirtiest\nfurniture of which I have ever heard. One wild horrified glance at the\ndirt, squalor, and total benightedness that met me on every side, and I\ntrembled in every limb with suppressed emotion and the frantic longing\nto get back to Caddagat which possessed me. One instant showed me that I\ncould never, never live here.\n\n\"Have ye had yer dinner?\" my future mistress inquired in a rough\nuncultivated voice. I replied in the negative.\n\n\"Sure, ye'll be dyin' of hunger; but I'll have it in a twinklin'.\"\n\nShe threw a crumpled and disgustingly filthy cloth three-cornered ways\non to the dusty table and clapped thereon a couple of dirty knives and\nforks, a pair of cracked plates, two poley cups and chipped saucers.\nNext came a plate of salt meat, red with saltpetre, and another of dark,\ndry, sodden bread. She then disappeared to the kitchen to make the tea,\nand during her absence two of the little boys commenced to fight. One\nclutched the tablecloth, and over went the whole display with a\nbang--meat-dish broken, and meat on the dusty floor; while the cats and\nfowls, ever on the alert for such occurrences, made the most of their\nopportunities. Mrs M'Swat returned carrying the tea, which was spilling\nby the way. She gave those boys each a clout on the head which dispersed\nthem roaring like the proverbial town bull, and alarmed me for the\nsafety of their ear-drums. I wondered if their mother was aware of their\nhaving ear-drums. She grabbed the meat, and wiping it on her greasy\napron, carried it around in her hand until she found a plate for it, and\nby that time the children had collected the other things. A cup was\nbroken, and another, also a poley, was put in its stead.\n\nMr M'Swat now appeared, and after taking a nip out of a rum bottle which\nhe produced from a cupboard in the corner, he invited me to sit up to\ndinner.\n\nThere was no milk. M'Swat went in entirely for sheep, keeping only a few\ncows for domestic purposes: these, on account of the drought, had been\ndry for some months. Mrs M'Swat apologized for the lack of sugar,\nstating she was quite out of it and had forgotten to send for a fresh\nsupply.\n\n\"You damned fool, to miss such a chance wen I was goin' to town with the\nwagonette! I mightn't be groin' in again for munce [months]. But sugar\ndon't count much. Them as can't do without a useless luxury like that\nfor a spell will never make much of a show at gettin' on in the\nwu-r-r-r-1d,\" concluded Mr M'Swat, sententiously.\n\nThe children sat in a row and, with mouths open and interest in their\nbig wondering eyes, gazed at me unwinkingly till I felt I must rush away\nsomewhere and shriek to relieve the feeling of overstrained hysteria\nwhich was overcoming me. I contained myself sufficiently, however, to\nask if this was all the family.\n\n\"All but Peter. Where's Peter, Mary Ann?\"\n\n\"He went to the Red Hill to look after some sheep, and won't be back\ntill dark.\"\n\n\"Peter's growed up,\" remarked one little boy, with evident pride in this\nmember of the family.\n\n\"Yes; Peter's twenty-one, and hes a mustatche and shaves,\" said the\neldest girl, in a manner indicating that she expected me to be struck\ndumb with surprise.\n\n\"She'll be surprised wen she sees Peter,\" said a little girl in an\naudible whisper.\n\nMrs M'Swat vouchsafed the information that three had died between Peter\nand Lizer, and this was how the absent son came to be so much older than\nhis brothers and sisters.\n\n\"So you have had twelve children?\" I said.\n\n\"Yes,\" she replied, laughing fatly, as though it were a joke.\n\n\"The boys found a bees' nest in a tree an' have been robbin' it the\nsmornin',\" continued Mrs M'Swat.\n\n\"Yes; we have ample exemplification of that,\" I responded. It was honey\nhere and honey there and honey everywhere. It was one of the many\nvarieties of dirt on the horrible foul-smelling tablecloth. It was on\nthe floor, the door, the chairs, the children's heads, and the cups. Mrs\nM'Swat remarked contentedly that it always took a couple of days to wear\n\"off of\" things.\n\nAfter \"dinner\" I asked for a bottle of ink and some paper, and scrawled\na few lines to grannie and my mother, merely reporting my safe arrival\nat my destination. I determined to take time to collect my thoughts\nbefore petitioning for release from Barney's Gap.\n\nI requested my mistress to show me where I was to sleep, and she\nconducted me to a fairly respectable little bedroom, of which I was to\nbe sole occupant, unless I felt lonely and would like Rose Jane to sleep\nwith me. I looked at pretty, soft-eyed, dirty little Rose Jane, and\nassured her kind-hearted mother I would not be the least lonely, as the\nsickening despairing loneliness which filled my heart was not of a\nnature to be cured by having as a bedmate a frowzy wild child.\n\nUpon being left alone I barred my door and threw myself on the bed to\ncry--weep wild hot tears that scalded my cheeks, and sobs that shook my\nwhole frame and gave me a violent pain in the head.\n\nOh, how coarse and grating were the sounds to be heard around me! Lack,\nnay, not lack, but utter freedom from the first instincts of\ncultivation, was to be heard even in the great heavy footfalls and the\nrasping sharp voices which fell on my ears. So different had I been\nlistening in a room at Caddagat to my grannie's brisk pleasant voice, or\nto my aunt Helen's low refined accents; and I am such a one to see and\nfeel these differences.\n\nHowever, I pulled together in a little while, and called myself a fool\nfor crying. I would write to grannie and mother explaining matters, and\nI felt sure they would heed me, as they had no idea what the place was\nlike. I would have only a little while to wait patiently, then I would\nbe among all the pleasures of Caddagat again; and how I would revel in\nthem, more than ever, after a taste of a place like this, for it was\nworse than I had imagined it could be, even in the nightmares which had\nhaunted me concerning it before leaving Caddagat.\n\nThe house was of slabs, unlimed, and with very low iron roof, and having\nno sign of a tree near it, the heat was unendurable. It was reflected\nfrom the rocks on either side, and concentrated in this spot like an\noven, being 122 degrees in the veranda now. I wondered why M'Swat had\nbuilt in such a hole, but it appears it was the nearness of the point to\nwater which recommended it to his judgment.\n\nWith the comforting idea that I would not have long to bear this, I\nbathed my eyes, and walked away from the house to try and find a cooler\nspot. The children saw me depart but not return, to judge from a\ndiscussion of myself which I heard in the dining-room, which adjoined my\nbed-chamber.\n\nPeter came home, and the children clustered around to tell the news.\n\n\"Did she come?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Wot's she like?\"\n\n\"Oh, a rale little bit of a thing, not as big as Lizer!\n\n\"And, Peter, she hes teeny little hands, as wite as snow, like that\nwoman in the picter ma got off of the tea.\"\n\n\"Yes, Peter,\" chimed in another voice; \"and her feet are that little\nthat she don't make no nise wen she walks.\"\n\n\"It ain't only becos her feet are little, but cos she's got them\nbeautiful shoes like wot's in picters,\" said another.\n\n\"Her hair is tied with two great junks of ribbing, one up on her head\nan' another near the bottom; better than that bit er red ribbing wot\nLizer keeps in the box agin the time she might go to town some day.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said the voice of Mrs M'Swat, \"her hair is near to her knees, and\na plait as thick as yer arm; and wen she writ a couple of letters in a\nminute, you could scarce see her hand move it was that wonderful quick;\nand she uses them big words wot you couldn't understand without bein'\neddicated.\"\n\n\"She has tree brooches, and a necktie better than your best one wots you\nkeeps to go seeing Susie Duffy in,\" and Lizer giggled slyly.\n\n\"You shut up about Susie Duffy, or I'll whack yuz up aside of the ear,\"\nsaid Peter angrily.\n\n\"She ain't like ma. She's fat up here, and goes in like she'd break in\nthe middle, Peter.\"\n\n\"Great scissors! she must be a flyer,\" said Peter. \"I'll bet she'll make\nyou sit up, Jimmy.\"\n\n\"I'll make her sit up,\" retorted Jimmy, who came next to Lizer.--\"She\nthinks she's a toff, but she's only old Melvyn's darter, that pa has to\ngive money to.\"\n\n\"Peter,\" said another, \"her face ain't got them freckles on like yours,\nand it ain't dark like Lizer's. It's reel wite, and pinky round here.\"\n\n\"I bet she won't make me knuckle down to her, no matter wot colour she\nis,\" returned Peter, in a surly tone.\n\nNo doubt it was this idea which later in the afternoon induced him to\nswagger forward to shake hands with me with a flash insolent leer on his\nface. I took pains to be especially nice to him, treating him with\ndeference, and making remarks upon the extreme heat of the weather with\nsuch pleasantness that he was nonplussed, and looked relieved when able\nto escape. I smiled to myself, and apprehended no further trouble from\nPeter.\n\nThe table for tea was set exactly as it had been before, and was lighted\nby a couple of tallow candles made from bad fat, and their odour was\nsuch as my jockey travelling companion of the day before would have\ndescribed as a tough smell.\n\n\"Give us a toon on the peeany,\" said Mrs M'Swat after the meal, when the\ndishes had been cleared away by Lizer and Rose Jane. The tea and scraps,\nof which there was any amount, remained on the floor, to be picked up by\nthe fowls in the morning.\n\nThe children lay on the old sofa and on the chairs, where they always\nslept at night until their parents retired, when there was an all-round\nbawl as they were wakened and bundled into bed, dirty as they were, and\nvery often with their clothes on.\n\nI acceded to Mrs M'Swat's request with alacrity, thinking that while\nforced to remain there I would have one comfort, and would spend all my\nspare time at the piano. I opened the instrument, brushed a little of\nthe dust from the keys with my pocket-handkerchief, and struck the\nopening chords of Kowalski's \"Marche Hongroise\".\n\nI have heard of pianos sounding like a tin dish, but this was not as\nPleasant as a tin dish by long chalks. Every note that I struck stayed\ndown not to rise, and when I got them up the jarring, clanging,\ndiscordant clatter they produced beggars description. There was not the\nslightest possibility of distinguishing any tune on the thing. Worthless\nto begin with, it had stood in the dust, heat, and wind so long that\nevery sign that it had once made music had deserted it.\n\nI closed it with a feeling of such keen disappointment that I had\ndifficulty in suppressing tears.\n\n\"Won't it play?\" inquired Mr M'Swat.\n\n\"No; the keys stay down.\"\n\n\"Then, Rose Jane, go ye an' pick 'em up while she tries again.\"\n\nI tried again, Rose Jane fishing up the keys as I went along. I\nperceived instantly that not one had the least ear for music or idea\nwhat it was; so I beat on the demented piano with both hands, and often\nwith all fingers at once, and the bigger row I made the better they\nliked it.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER TWENTY-NINE\n\nTo Life--continued\n\n\nMr M'Swat very kindly told me I need not begin my duties until Monday\nmorning, and could rest during Saturday and Sunday. Saturday, which was\nsickeningly hot and sultry, and which seemed like an eternity, I spent\nin arranging my belongings, brushing the dust from my travelling dress,\nand in mending a few articles. Next morning rain started to fall, which\nwas a great God-send, being the first which had fallen for months, and\nthe only rain I saw during my residence at Barney's Gap.\n\nThat was a hideous Sabbath. Without a word of remonstrance from their\nparents, the children entertained themselves by pushing each other into\nthe rain, the smaller ones getting the worst of it, until their clothing\nwas saturated with water. This made them very cold, so they sat upon the\nfloor and yelled outrageously.\n\nIt was the custom of Peter to spend his Sundays in riding about, but\ntoday, being deterred by the rain, he slept some of the time, and made a\nmuzzle for one of his dogs, between whiles.\n\nFrom breakfast to the midday meal I shut myself in my bedroom and wrote\nletters to my mother and grandmother. I did not rant, rave, or say\nanything which I ought not to have said to my elders. I wrote those\nletters very coolly and carefully, explaining things just as they were,\nand asked grannie to take me back to Caddagat, as I could never endure\nlife at Barney's Gap. I told my mother I had written thus, and asked her\nif she would not let grannie take me again, would she get me some other\nsituation? What I did not care, so long as it brought emancipation from\nthe M'Swat's. I stamped and addressed these missives, and put them by\ntill a chance of posting should arise.\n\nMr M'Swat could read a little by spelling the long words and blundering\nover the shorter ones, and he spent the morning and all the afternoon in\nperusal of the local paper--the only literature with which Barney's Gap\nwas acquainted. There was a long list of the prices of stock and farm\nproduce in this edition, which perfectly fascinated its reader. The\necstasy of a man of fine, artistic, mental calibre, when dipping for the\nfirst time into the work of some congenial poet, would be completely\nwiped out in comparison to the utter soul-satisfaction of M'Swat when\ndrinking in the items of that list.\n\n\"By damn, pigs was up last Toosday! Thames the things to make prawfit\non,\" he would excitedly exclaim; or--\"Wheat's rose a shillun a bushel!\nBy dad, I must double my crops this year.\" When he had plodded to the\nend, he started at the beginning again.\n\nHis wife sat the whole afternoon in the one place, saying and doing\nnothing. I looked for something to read, but the only books in the house\nwere a Bible, which was never opened, and a diary kept most religiously\nby M'Swat. I got permission to read this, and opening it, saw:\n\n    \"September\n\n    1st. Fine. Wint to boggie creak for a cow.\n    2nd. Fine. Got the chestnut mair shode.\n    3rd. Fine. On the jury.\n    4th. Fine. Tail the lams 60 yeos 52 wethers.\n    5th. Cloudy. Wint to Duffys.\n    6th. Fine. Dave Duffy called.\n    7th. Fine. Roped the red filly.\n    8th. Showery. Sold the gray mair's fole.\n    9th. Fine. Wint to the Red hill after a horse.\n    10th. Fine, Found tree sheap ded in sqre padick.\"\n\nI closed the book and put it up with a sigh. The little record was a\nperfect picture of the dull narrow life of its writer. Week after week\nthat diary went on the same--drearily monotonous account of a drearily\nmonotonous existence. I felt I would go mad if forced to live such a\nlife for long.\n\n\"Pa has lots of diaries. Would I like to read them?\"\n\nThey were brought and put before me. I inquired of Mr M'Swat which was\nthe liveliest time of the year, and being told it was shearing and\nthreshing, I opened one first in November:\n\n    \"November 1896\n\n    1st. Fine. Started to muster sheap.\n    2nd. Fine. Counten sheap very dusty 20 short.\n    3rd. Fine. Started shering. Joe Harris cut his hand bad and wint hoam.\n    4th. Showery. Shering stoped on account of rane.\"\n\nThen I skipped to December:\n\n    \"December 1896\n\n    1st. Fine and hot. Stripped the weet 60 bages.\n    2nd. Fine. Killed a snake very hot day.\n    3rd. Fine. Very hot alle had a boagy in the river.\n    4th. Fine. Got returns of woll 7 1\/2 fleece 5 1\/4 bellies.\n    5th. Fine. Awful hot got a serkeler from Tatersal by the poast.\n    6th. Fine. Saw Joe Harris at Duffys.\"\n\nThere was no entertainment to be had from the diaries, so I attempted a\nconversation with Mrs M'Swat.\n\n\"A penny for your thoughts.\"\n\n\"I wuz jist watchin' the rain and thinkin' it would put a couple a bob a\nhead more on sheep if it keeps on.\"\n\nWhat was I to do to pass the day? I was ever very restless, even in the\nmidst of full occupation. Uncle Jay-Jay used to accuse me of being in\nsix places at once, and of being incapable of sitting still for five\nminutes consecutively; so it was simply endurance to live that long,\nlong day--nothing to read, no piano on which to play hymns, too wet to\nwalk, none with whom to converse, no possibility of sleeping, as in an\nendeavour to kill a little of the time I had gone to bed early and got\nup late. There was nothing but to sit still, tormented by maddening\nregret. I pictured what would be transpiring at Caddagat now; what we\nhad done this time last week, and so on, till the thing became an agony\nto me.\n\n\n\nAmong my duties before school I was to set the table, make all the beds,\ndust and sweep, and \"do\" the girls' hair. After school I had to mend\nclothes, sew, set the table again, take a turn at nursing the baby, and\non washing-day iron. This sounds a lot, but in reality was nothing, and\ndid not half occupy my time. Setting the table was a mere sinecure, as\nthere was nothing much to put on it; and the only ironing was a few\narticles outside my own, as Mr M'Swat and Peter did not wear white\nshirts, and patronised paper collars. Mrs M'Swat did the washing and a\nlittle scrubbing, also boiled the beef and baked the bread, which formed\nour unvaried menu week in and week out. Most peasant mothers with a\nfamily of nine have no time for idleness, but Mrs M'Swat managed things\nso that she spent most of the day rolling on her frowsy bed playing with\nher dirty infant, which was as fat and good-tempered as herself.\n\nOn Monday morning I marshalled my five scholars (Lizer, aged fourteen;\nJimmy, twelve; Tommy, Sarah, and Rose Jane, younger) in a little back\nskillion, which was set apart as a schoolroom and store for flour and\nrock-salt. Like all the house, it was built of slabs, which, erected\nwhile green, and on account Of the heat, had shrunk until many of the\ncracks were sufficiently wide to insert one's arm. On Monday--after the\nrain--the wind, which disturbed us through them, was piercingly cold,\nbut as the week advanced summer and drought regained their pitiless\nsway, and we were often sunburnt by the rough gusts which filled the\nroom with such clouds of dust and grit that we were forced to cover our\nheads until it passed.\n\nA policeman came on Tuesday to take some returns, and to him I entrusted\nthe posting of my letters, and then eagerly waited for the reply which\nwas to give me glorious release.\n\nThe nearest post-office was eight miles distant, and thither Jimmy was\ndispatched on horseback twice a week. With trembling expectancy every\nmail-day I watched for the boy's return down the tortuous track to the\nhouse, but it was always, \"No letters for the school-missus.\"\n\nA week, a fortnight, dragged away. Oh, the slow horror of those\nnever-ending days! At the end of three weeks Mr M'Swat went to the post\nunknown to me, and surprised me with a couple of letters. They bore the\nhandwriting of my mother and grandmother--what I had been wildly waiting\nfor,--and now that they had come at last I had not the nerve to open\nthem while any one was observing me. All day I carried them in my bosom\ntill my work was done, when I shut myself in my room and tore the\nenvelopes open to read first my grannie's letter, which contained two:\n\n\nMY DEAR CHILD,\n\nI have been a long time answering your letter on account of waiting to\nconsult your mother. I was willing to take you back, but your mother is\nnot agreeable, so I cannot interfere between you. I enclose your\nmother's letter, so you can see how I stand in the matter. Try and do\ngood where you are. We cannot get what we would like in this world, and\nmust bow to God's will. He will always, &c.\n\n\n_Mother's Letter to Grannie_\n\n\nMY DEAR MOTHER,\n\nI am truly grieved that Sybylla should have written and worried you.\nTake no notice of her; it is only while she is unused to the place. She\nwill soon settle down. She has always been a trial to me, and it is no\nuse of taking notice of her complaints, which no doubt are greatly\nexaggerated, as she was never contented at home. I don't know where her\nrebellious spirit will eventually lead her. I hope M'Swat's will tame\nher; it will do her good. It is absolutely necessary that she should\nremain there, so do not say anything to give her other ideas &c.\n\n\n_Mother's Letter to Me_\n\n\nMY DEAR SYBYLLA,\n\nI wish you would not write and worry your poor old grandmother, who has\nbeen so good to you. You must try and put up with things; you cannot\nexpect to find it like holidaying at Caddagat. Be careful not to give\noffence to any one, as it would be awkward for us. What is wrong with\nthe place? Have you too much work to do? Do you not get sufficient to\ncat? Are they unkind to you, or what? Why don't you have sense and not\ntalk of getting another place, as it is utterly impossible; and unless\nyou remain there, how are we to pay the interest on that money? I've\nalways been a good mother to you, and the least you might do in return\nis this, when you know how we are situated. Ask God &c.\n\n\nFull of contempt and hatred for my mother, I tore her letters into tiny\npieces and hurled them out the window. Oh, the hard want of sympathy\nthey voiced! She had forced me to this place: it would have been\ndifferent had I wanted to come of my own accord, and then sung out for a\nremoval immediately; but no, against my earnest pleadings she had forced\nme here, and now would not heed my cry. And to whom in all the world can\nwe turn when our mother spurns our prayer?\n\nThere never was any sympathy between my mother and myself. We are too\nunlike. She is intensely matter-of-fact and practical, possessed of no\nambitions or aspirations not capable of being turned into cash value.\nShe is very ladylike, and though containing no spice of either poet or\nmusician, can take a part in conversation on such subjects, and play the\npiano correctly, because in her young days she was thus cultivated; but\nhad she been horn a peasant, she would have been a peasant, with no\nlongings unattainable in that sphere. She no more understood me than I\nunderstand the works of a watch. She looked upon me as a discontented,\nrebellious, bad child, possessed of evil spirits, which wanted trouncing\nout of me; and she would have felt that she was sinning had she humoured\nme in any way, so after cooling I did not blame her for her letters. She\nwas doing her duty according to her lights. Again, it was this way,\ngrannie did not come to my rescue on this occasion on account of her\nattitude towards my father. The Bossiers were not at enmity with him,\nbut they were so disgusted with his insobriety that they never visited\nPossum Gully, and did not assist us as much as they would have done had\nmy father's failure been attributable to some cause more deserving of\nsympathy.\n\nAfter reading my letters I wept till every atom of my body writhed with\nagonized emotion. I was aroused by Mrs M'Swat hammering at my door and\ninquiring:\n\n\"What ails ye, child? Did ye git bad noos from home?\"\n\nI recovered myself as by a miracle, and replied, no; that I was merely a\nlittle homesick, and would be out presently.\n\nI wrote again to my mother, but as I could not truthfully say I was\nhungry or ill-treated, for, according to their ability, the M'Swats were\nvery kind to me, she took no notice of my plaint, but told me that\ninstead of complaining of monotony, it would suit me better if I cleared\nup the house a little.\n\nActing upon this advice, I asked Mr M'Swat to put a paling fence round\nthe house, as it was useless trying to keep the house respectable while\nthe fowls and pigs ran in every time the door was opened.--\n\nHe was inclined to look with favour upon this proposition, but his wife\nsat upon it determinedly--said the fowls would lose the scraps. \"Would\nit not be possible to throw them over the fence to the fowls?\" I asked;\nbut this would cause too much waste, she considered.\n\nNext I suggested that the piano should be tuned, but they were united in\ntheir disapproval of such a fearful extravagance. \"The peeany makes a\ngood nise. What ails it?\"\n\nThen I suggested that the children should be kept tidier, for which I\nwas insulted by their father. I wanted them to be dressed up like\nswells, and if he did that he would soon be a pauper like my father.\nThis I found was the sentiment of the whole family regarding me. I was\nonly the daughter of old hard-up Melvyn, consequently I had little\nweight with the children, which made things very hard for me as a\nteacher.\n\nOne day at lunch I asked my mistress if she would like the children to\nbe instructed in table-manners. \"Certainly,\" her husband replied, so I\ncommenced.\n\n\"Jimmy, you must never put your knife in your mouth.\"\n\n\"Pa does at any rate,\" replied Jimmy.\n\n\"Yes,\" said pa; \"and I'm a richer man today than them as didn't do it.\"\n\n\"Liza, do not put a whole slice of bread to your mouth like that, and\ncram so. Cut it into small pieces.\"\n\n\"Ma doesn't,\" returned Liza.\n\n\"Ye'll have yer work cut out with 'em,\" laughed Mrs M'Swat, who did not\nknow how to correct her family herself, and was too ignorant to uphold\nmy authority.\n\nThat was my only attempt at teaching manners there. In the face of such\nodds it was a bootless task, and as there were not enough knives and\nforks to go round, I could not inculcate the correct method of handling\nthose implements.\n\nMrs M'Swat had but one boiler in which to do all her cooking, and one\nsmall tub for the washing, and there was seldom anything to eat but\nbread and beef; and this was not because they were poor, but because\nthey did not know, or want to know, any better.\n\nTheir idea of religion, pleasure, manners, breeding, respectability,\nlove, and everything of that ilk, was the possession of money, and their\none idea of accumulating wealth was by hard sordid dragging and\ngrinding.\n\nA man who rises from indigence to opulence by business capabilities must\nhave brains worthy of admiration, but the man who makes a fortune as\nM'Swat of Barney's Gap was making his must be dirt mean, grasping,\nnarrow-minded, and soulless--to me the most uncongenial of my fellows.\n\nI wrote once more to my mother, to receive the same reply. One hope\nremained. I would write to aunt Helen. She understood me somewhat, and\nwould know how I felt.\n\nActing on this inspiration, I requested her to plead for me. Her answer\ncame as a slap in the face, as I had always imagined her above the\ncommon cant of ordinary religionists. She stated that life was full of\ntrials. I must try and bear this little cross patiently, and at the end\nof a year they might have me back at Caddagat. A year! A year at\nBarney's Gap! The possibility of such a thing made me frantic. I picked\nup my pen and bitterly reproached my aunt in a letter to which she did\nnot deign to reply; and from that day to this she has rigidly ignored\nme--never so much as sending me the most commonplace message, or\ncasually using my name in her letters to my mother.\n\nAunt Helen, is there such a thing as firm friendship when even\nyours--best of women--quibbled and went under at the hysterical wail\nfrom the overburdened heart of a child?\n\nMy predecessor, previous to her debut at Barney's Gap, had spent some\ntime in a lunatic asylum, and being a curious character, allowed the\nchildren to do as they pleased, consequently they knew not what it meant\nto be ruled, and were very hold. They attempted no insubordination while\ntheir father was about the house, but when he was absent they gave me a\ndog's life, their mother sometimes smiling on their pranks, often lazily\nheedless of them, but never administering any form of correction.\n\nIf I walked away from the house to get rid of them, they would follow\nand hoot at me; and when I reproved them they informed me they were not\ngoing \"to knuckle under to old Melvyn's darter, the damnedest fool in\nthe world, who's lost all his prawperty, and has to borry money off of\npa.\"\n\nDid I shut myself in my room, they shoved sticks in the cracks and made\ngrimaces at me. I knew the fallacy of appealing to their father, as they\nand their mother would tell falsehoods, and my word would not be taken\nin contradiction of theirs. I had experience of this, as the\npostmistress had complained of Jimmy, to be insulted by his father, who\ncould see no imperfection in his children.\n\nM'Swat was much away from home at that time. The drought necessitated\nthe removal of some of his sheep, for which he had rented a place eighty\nmiles coastwards. There he left them under the charge of a man, but he\nrepaired thither frequently to inspect them. Sometimes he was away from\nhome a fortnight at a stretch. Peter would be away at work all day, and\nthe children took advantage of my defenceless position. Jimmy was the\nringleader. I could easily have managed the others had he been removed.\nI would have thrashed him well at the start but for the letters I\nconstantly received from home warning me against offence to the parents,\nand knew that to set my foot on the children's larrikinism would require\nmeasures that would gain their mother's ill-will at once. But when\nM'Swat left home for three weeks Jim got so bold that I resolved to take\ndecisive steps towards subjugating him. I procured a switch--a very\nsmall one, as his mother had a great objection to corporal\npunishment--and when, as usual, he commenced to cheek me during lessons,\nI hit him on the coat-sleeve. The blow would not have brought tears from\nthe eyes of a toddler, but this great calf emitted a wild yope, and\nopening his mouth let his saliva pour on to his slate. The others set up\nsuch blood-curdling yells in concert that I was a little disconcerted,\nbut I determined not to give in. I delivered another tap, whereupon he\nsquealed and roared so that he brought his mother to his rescue like a\nton of bricks on stilts, a great fuss in her eyes which generally beamed\nwith a cowful calm.\n\nSeizing my arm she shook me like a rat, broke my harmless little stick\nin pieces, threw it in my face, and patting Jimmy on the shoulder, said:\n\n\"Poor man! She sharn't touch me Jimmy while I know. Sure you've got no\nsense. You'd had him dead if I hadn't come in.\"\n\nI walked straight to my room and shut myself in, and did not teach any\nmore that afternoon. The children rattled on my door-handle and jeered:\n\n\"She thought she'd hit me, but ma settled her. Old poor Melvyn's darter\nwon't try no more of her airs on us.\"\n\nI pretended not to hear. What was I to do? There was no one to whom I\ncould turn for help. M'Swat would believe the story of his family, and\nmy mother would blame me. She would think I had been in fault because I\nhated the place.\n\nMrs M'Swat called me to tea, but I said I would not have any. I lay\nawake all night and got desperate. On the morrow I made up my mind to\nconquer or leave. I would stand no more. If in all the wide world and\nthe whole of life this was the only use for me, then I would die--take\nmy own life if necessary.\n\nThings progressed as usual next morning. I attended to my duties and\nmarched my scholars into the schoolroom at the accustomed hour. There\nwas no decided insubordination during the morning, but I felt Jimmy was\nwaiting for an opportunity to defy me. It was a fearful day, possessed\nby a blasting wind laden with red dust from Riverina, which filled the\nair like a fog. The crockery ware became so hot in the kitchen that when\ntaking it into the dining-room we had to handle it with cloths. During\nthe dinner-hour I slipped away unnoticed to where some quince-trees were\ngrowing and procured a sharp rod, which I secreted among the flour-bags\nin the schoolroom. At half-past one I brought my scholars in and ordered\nthem to their work with a confident air. Things went without a ripple\nuntil three o'clock, when the writing lesson began. Jimmy struck his pen\non the bottom of the bottle every time he replenished it with ink.\n\n\"Jimmy,\" I gently remonstrated, \"don't jab your pen like that--it will\nspoil it. There is no necessity to shove it right to the bottom.\"\n\nJab, jab, went Jimmy's pen.\n\n\"Jimmy, did you hear me speak to you?\"\n\nJab went the pen.\n\n\"James, I am speaking to you!\"\n\nJab went the pen again.\n\n\"James,\" I said sternly, \"I give you one more chance.\"\n\nHe deliberately defied me by stabbing into the ink-bottle with increased\nvigour. Liza giggled triumphantly, and the little ones strove to emulate\nher. I calmly produced my switch and brought it smartly over the\nshoulders of my refractory pupil in a way that sent the dust in a cloud\nfrom his dirty coat, knocked the pen from his fingers, and upset the\nink.\n\nHe acted as before--yelled ear-drum-breakingly, letting the saliva from\nhis distended mouth run on his copy-book. His brothers and sisters also\nstarted to roar, but bringing the rod down on the table, I threatened to\nthrash every one of them if they so much as whimpered; and they were so\ndumbfounded that they sat silent in terrified surprise. Jimmy continued\nto bawl. I hit him again.\n\n\"Cease instantly, sir.\"\n\nThrough the cracks Mrs M'Swat could be seen approaching. Seeing her,\nJimmy hollered anew. I expected her to attack me. She stood five feet\nnine inches, and weighed about sixteen stones; I measured five feet one\ninch, and turned the scale at eight stones--scarcely a fair match; but\nmy spirit was aroused, and instead of feeling afraid, I rejoiced at the\nencounter which was imminent, and had difficulty to refrain from\nshouting \"Come on! I'm ready, physically and mentally, for you and a\ndozen others such.\"\n\nMy curious ideas regarding human equality gave me confidence. My theory\nis that the cripple is equal to the giant, and the idiot to the genius.\nAs, if on account of his want of strength the cripple is subservient to\nthe giant, the latter, on account of that strength, is compelled to give\nin to the cripple. So with the dolt and the man of brain, so with Mrs\nM'Swat and me.\n\nThe fact of not only my own but my family's dependence on M'Swat--sank\ninto oblivion. I merely recognized that she was one human being and I\nanother. Should I have been deferential to her by reason of her age and\nmaternity, then from the vantage which this gave her, she should have\nbeen lenient to me on account of my chit-ship and inexperience. Thus we\nwere equal.\n\nJimmy hollered with renewed energy to attract his mother, and I\ncontinued to rain blows across his shoulders. Mrs M'Swat approached to\nwithin a foot of the door, and then, as though changing her mind,\nretraced her steps and entered the hot low-roofed kitchen. I knew I had\nwon, and felt disappointed that the conquest had been so easy. Jimmy,\nseeing he was worsted, ceased his uproar, cleaned his copy-book on his\nsleeve, and sheepishly went on with his writing.\n\nWhether Mrs M'Swat saw she had been in fault the day before I know not;\ncertain it is that the children ever after that obeyed me, and I heard\nno more of the matter; neither, as far as I could ascertain, did the\n\"ruction\" reach the ears of M'Swat.\n\n\"How long, how long!\" was my cry, as I walked out ankle-deep in the dust\nto see the sun, like a ball of blood, sink behind the hills on that\nFebruary evening.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THIRTY\n\nWhere Ignorance is Bliss, 'Tis Folly to be Wise\n\n\nWhen by myself, I fretted so constantly that the traces it left upon me\nbecame evident even to the dull comprehension of Mrs M'Swat.\n\n\"I don't hold with too much pleasure and disherpation, but you ain't had\novermuch of it lately. You've stuck at home pretty constant, and ye and\nLizer can have a little fly round. It'll do yous good,\" she said.\n\nThe dissipation, pleasure, and flying round allotted to \"Lizer\" and me\nwere to visit some of the neighbours. Those, like the M'Swats, were\nsheep-farming selectors. They were very friendly and kind to me, and I\nfound them superior to my employers, in that their houses were\nbeautifully clean; but they lived the same slow life, and their soul's\nexistence fed on the same small ideas. I was keenly disappointed that\nnone of them had a piano, as my hunger for music could be understood\nonly by one with a passion for that art.\n\nI borrowed something to read, but all that I could get in the way of\nbooks were a few _Young Ladies' Journals_, which I devoured ravenously,\nso to speak.\n\nWhen Lizer's back would be turned, the girls would ask me how I managed\nto live at Barney's Gap, and expressed themselves of the opinion that it\nwas the most horrible hole in the world, and Mrs M'Swat the dirtiest\ncreature living, and that they would not go there for 50 pounds a week.\nI made a point of never saying anything against Mrs M'Swat; but I fumed\ninwardly that this life was forced upon me, when girls with no longings\nor aspirations beyond being the wife of a Peter M'Swat recoiled from the\nthought of it.\n\nMy mother insisted upon my writing to her regularly, so once a week I\nheaded a letter \"Black's Camp\", and condemned the place, while mother as\nunfailingly replied that these bad times I should be thankful to God\nthat I was fed and clothed. I knew this as well as any one, and was\naware there were plenty of girls willing to jump at my place; but they\nwere of different temperament to me, and when one is seventeen, that\nkind of reasoning does not weigh very heavily.\n\nMy eldest brother, Horace, twin brother of my sister Gertie, took it\nupon himself to honour me with the following letter:\n\n\nWhy the deuce don't you give up writing those letters to mother? We get\ntongue-pie on account of them, and it's not as if they did you any good.\nIt only makes mother more determined to leave you where you are. She\nsays you are that conceited you think you ought to have something\nbetter, and you're not fit for the place you have, and she's glad it is\nsuch a place, and it will do you the world of good and take the nonsense\nout of you--that it's time you got a bit of sense. Sullivan's Ginger.\nAfter she gets your letters she does jaw, and wishes she never had a\nchild, and what a good mother she is, and what bad devils we are to her.\nYou are a fool not to stay where you are. I wish I could get away to\nM'Swat or Mack Pot, and I would jump at the chance like a good un. The\nboss still sprees and loafs about town till some one has to go and haul\nhim home. I'm about full of him, and I'm going to leave home before next\nChristmas, or my name ain't what it is. Mother says the kiddies would\nstarve if I leave; but Stanley is coming on like a haystack, I tell him,\nand he does kick up, and he ought to be able to plough next time. I\nploughed when I was younger than him. I put in fourteen acres of wheat\nand oats this year, and I don't think I'll cut a wheelbarrow-load of it.\nI'm full of the place. I never have a single penny to my name, and it\nain't father's drinking that's all to blame; if he didn't booze it\nwouldn't be much better. It's the slowest hole in the world, and I'll\nchuck it and go shearing or droving. I hate this dairying, it's too slow\nfor a funeral: there would be more life in trapping 'possums out on\nTimlinbilly. Mother always says to have patience, and when the drought\nbreaks and good seasons come round again things will be better, but it's\nno good of trying to stuff me like that. I remember when the seasons\nwere wet. It was no good growing anything, because every one grew so\nmuch that there was no market, and the sheep died of foot-rot and you\ncouldn't give your butter away, and it is not much worse to have nothing\nto sell than not be able to sell a thing when you have it. And the long\nand short of it is that I hate dairying like blue murder. It's as tame\nas a clucking hen. Fancy a cove sitting down every morning and evening\npulling at a cow's tits fit to bust himself, and then turning an old\nseparator, and washing it up in a dish of water like a blooming girl's\nwork. And if you go to a picnic, just when the fun commences you have to\nnick off home and milk, and when you tog yourself on Sunday evening you\nhave to undress again and lay into the milking, and then you have to\nchange everything on you and have a bath, or your best girl would scent\nthe cow-yard on you, and not have you within cooee of her. We won't know\nwhat rain is when we see it; but I suppose it will come in floods and\nfinish the little left by the drought. The grasshoppers have eaten all\nthe fruit and even the bark off the trees, and the caterpillars made a\ncroker of the few tomatoes we kept alive with the suds. All the cockeys\nround here and dad are applying to the Government to have their rents\nsuspended for a time. We have not heard yet whether it will be granted,\nbut if Gov. doesn't like it, they'll have to lump it, for none of us\nhave a penny to bless ourselves with, let alone dub up for taxes. I've\nwritten you a long letter, and if you growl about the spelling and\ngrammar I won't write to you any more, so there, and you take my tip and\ndon't write to mother on that flute any more, for she won't take a bit\nof notice.\n\nYr loving brother,\n\nHorace.\n\n\nSo! Mother had no pity for me, and the more I pleaded with her the more\ndetermined she grew upon leaving me to suffer on, so I wrote to her no\nmore. However, I continued to correspond with grannie, and in one of her\nletters she told me that Harry Beecham (that was in February) was still\nin Sydney settling his affairs; but when that was concluded he was going\nto Queensland. He had put his case in the hands of squatters he had\nknown in his palmy days, and the first thing that turned up in managing\nor overseeing he was to have; but for the present he had been offered\nthe charge of 1600 head of bullocks from a station up near the Gulf of\nCarpentaria overland to Victoria. Uncle Jay-Jay was not home yet: he had\nextended his tour to Hong Kong, and grannie was afraid he was spending\ntoo much money, as in the face of the drought she had difficulty in\nmaking both ends meet, and feared she would be compelled to go on the\nbanks. She grieved that I was not becoming more reconciled to my place.\nIt was dull, no doubt, but it would do my reputation no harm, whereas,\nwere I in a lively situation, there might be numerous temptations hard\nto resist. Why did I not try to look at it in that way?\n\nShe sent a copy of the _Australasian_, which was a great treat to me,\nalso to the children, as they were quite ignorant of the commonest\nthings in life, and the advent of this illustrated paper was an event to\nbe recorded in the diary in capital letters. They clustered round me\neagerly to see the pictures. In this edition there chanced to be a page\ndevoted to the portraits of eleven Australian singers, and our eyes fell\non Madame Melba, who was in the middle. As what character she was\ndressed I do not remember, but she looked magnificent. There was a crown\nupon her beautiful head, the plentiful hair was worn flowing, and the\nshapely bosom and arms exposed.\n\n\"Who's that?\" they inquired.\n\n\"Madame Melba; did you ever hear her name?\"\n\n\"Who's Madame Melba? What's she do? Is she a queen?\"\n\n\"Yes, a queen, and a great queen of song;\" and being inspired with great\nadmiration for our own Australian cantatrice, who was great among the\ngreatest prima-donnas of the world, I began to tell them a little of her\nfame, and that she had been recently offered 40,000 pounds to sing for\nthree months in America.\n\nThey were incredulous. Forty thousand pounds! Ten times as much as \"pa\"\nhad given for a paid-up selection he had lately bought. They told me it\nwas no use of me trying to tell them fibs. No one would give a woman\nanything to sing, not even one pound. Why, Susie Duffy was the best\nsinger on the Murrumbidgee, and she would sing for any one who asked\nher, and free of charge.\n\nAt this juncture Jimmy, who had been absent, came to see the show. After\ngazing for a few seconds he remarked what the others had failed to\nobserve, \"Why, the woman's naked!\"\n\nI attempted to explain that among rich people in high society it was\ncustomary to dress like that in the evening, and that it looked very\npretty.\n\nMrs M'Swat admonished me for showing the children low pictures.\n\n\"She must be a very bold woman,\" said Jimmy; and Lizer pronounced her\nmad because, as she put it, \"It's a wonder she'd be half-undressed in\nher photo; you'd think she oughter dress herself up complete then.\"\n\nLizer certainly acted upon this principle, as a photo of her, which had\nbeen taken by a travelling artist, bore evidence that for the occasion\nshe had arrayed herself in two pairs of ill-fitting cuffs, Peter's watch\nand chain, strings, jackets, flowers, and other gewgaws galore.\n\n\"There ain't no such person as Madame Melber; it's only a fairy-tale,\"\nsaid Mrs M'Swat.\n\n\"Did you ever hear of Gladstone?\" I inquired.\n\n\"No; where is that place?\"\n\n\"Did you ever hear of Jesus Christ?\"\n\n\"Sure, yes; he's got something to do with God, ain't he?\"\n\nAfter that I never attempted to enlighten them regarding our\ncelebrities.\n\nOh, how I envied them their ignorant contentment! They were as ducks on\na duck-pond; but I was as a duck forced for ever to live in a desert,\never wildly longing for water, but never reaching it outside of dreams.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THIRTY-ONE\n\nMr M'Swat and I Have a Bust-up\n\n\nMen only, and they merely on business, came to Barney's Gap--women\ntabooed the place. Some of them told me they would come to see me, but\nnot Mrs M'Swat, as she always allowed the children to be as rude to them\nas they pleased. With the few individuals who chanced to come M'Swat\nwould sit down, light his pipe, and vulgarly and profusely expectorate\non the floor, while they yarned and yarned for hours and hours about the\nprice of wool, the probable breeding capacity of the male stock they\nkept, and of the want of grass--never a word about their country's\npolitics or the events of the day; even the news of the \"Mountain\nMurders\" by Butler had not penetrated here. I wondered if they were\nacquainted with the names of their Governor and Prime Minister.\n\nIt was not the poor food and the filthy way of preparing it that worried\nme, or that Mr M'Swat used \"damn\" on an average twice in five minutes\nwhen conversing, or that the children for ever nagged about my father's\npoverty and tormented me in a thousand other ways--it was the dead\nmonotony that was killing me.\n\nI longed feveredly for something to happen. Agony is a tame word\nwherewith to express what that life meant to me. Solitary confinement to\na gipsy would be something on a par.\n\nEvery night unfailingly when at home M'Swat sat in the bosom of his\nfamily and speculated as to how much richer he was than his neighbours,\nwhat old Recce lived on, and who had the best breed of sheep and who was\nthe smartest at counting these animals, until the sordidness of it\nturned me dizzy, and I would steal out under the stars to try and cool\nmy heated spirit. This became a practice with me, and every night I\nwould slip away out of hearing of the household to sing the songs I had\nheard at Caddagat, and in imagination to relive every day and hour\nthere, till the thing became too much for me, and I was scarcely\nresponsible for my actions. Often I knelt on the parched ground beneath\nthe balmy summer sky to pray--wild passionate prayers that were never\nanswered.\n\nI was under the impression that my nightly ramble was not specially\nnoticed by any one, but I was mistaken. Mr M'Swat, it appears, suspected\nme of having a lover, but was never able to catch me red-handed.\n\nThe possibility of a girl going out at night to gaze at the stars and\ndream was as improbable a thought for him as flying is to me, and having\nno soul above mud, had I attempted an explanation he would have\nconsidered me mad, and dangerous to have about the place.\n\nPeter, junior, had a sweetheart, one Susie Duffy, who lived some miles\non the other side of the Murrumbidgee. He was in the habit of courting\nher every Sunday and two or three nights during the week, and I often\nheard the clang of his stirrup-irons and the clink of hobble-chain when\nhe returned late; but on one occasion I stayed out later than usual, and\nhe passed me going home. I stood still and he did not see me, but his\nhorse shied violently. I thought he would imagine I was a ghost, so\ncalled out:\n\n\"It is I.\"\n\n\"Well, I'll be hanged! What are ye doin' at this time ev night. Ain't\nyuz afraid of ghosts?\"\n\n\"Oh dear no. I had a bad headache and couldn't sleep, so came out to try\nif a walk would cure it,\" I explained.\n\nWe were a quarter of a mile or so from the house, so Peter slackened his\nspeed that I might keep pace with him. His knowledge of 'etiquette did\nnot extend as far as dismounting. There is a great difference between\nrudeness and ignorance. Peter was not rude; he was merely ignorant. For\nthe same reason he let his mother feed the pigs, clean his boots, and\nchop wood, while he sat down and smoked and spat. It was not that he was\nunmanly, as that this was the only manliness he had known.\n\n\nI was alone in the schoolroom next afternoon when Mr M'Swat sidled in,\nand after stuttering and hawing a little, delivered himself of:\n\n\"I want to tell ye that I don't hold with a gu-r-r-r-l going out of\nnights for to meet young men: if ye want to do any coortin' yuz can do\nit inside, if it's a decent young man. I have no objections to yer\nhangin' yer cap up to our Peter, only that ye have no prawperty--in\nyerself I like ye well enough, but we have other views for Peter. He's\nalmost as good as made it sure with Susie Duffy, an' as ole Duffy will\nhave a bit ev prawperty I want him to git her, an' wouldn't like ye to\nspoil the fun.\"\n\nPeter was \"tall and freckled and sandy, face of a country lout\", and,\nlike Middleton's rouse-about, \"hadn't any opinions, hadn't any ideas\",\nbut possessed sufficient instinct and common bushcraft with which, by\nhard slogging, to amass money. He was developing a moustache, and had a\n\"gu-r-r-r-l\"; he wore tight trousers and long spurs; he walked with a\nsidling swagger that was a cross between shyness and flashness, and took\nas much pride in his necktie as any man; he had a kind heart, honest\nprinciples, and would not hurt a fly; he worked away from morning till\nnight, and contentedly did his duty like a bullock in the sphere in\nwhich God had placed him; he never had a bath while I knew him, and was\na man according to his lights. He knew there was such a thing as the\noutside world, as I know there is such a thing as algebra; but it\ntroubled him no more than algebra troubles me.\n\nThis was my estimation of Peter M'Swat, junior. I respected him right\nenough in his place, as I trust he respected me in mine, but though fate\nthought fit for the present to place us in the one groove, yet our lives\nwere unmixable commodities as oil and water, which lay apart and would\nnever meet until taken in hand by the omnipotent leveller--death.\n\nMarriage with Peter M'Swat!\n\nConsternation and disgust held me speechless, and yet I was half\ninclined to laugh at the preposterousness of the thing, when Peter's\nfather continued:\n\n\"I'm sorry if you've got smitten on Peter, but I know you'll be\nsensible. Ye see I have a lot of children, and when the place is divided\namong 'em it won't be much. I tell ye wot, old Duffy has a good bit of\nmoney and only two children, Susie and Mick. I could get you to meet\nMick--he mayn't be so personable as our Peter,\" he reflected, with\nevident pride in his weedy firstborn, and he got no farther, for I had\nbeen as a yeast-bottle bubbling up, and now went off bang!\n\n\"Silence, you ignorant old creature! How dare you have the incomparable\nimpertinence to mention my name in conjunction with that of your boor of\na son. Though he were a millionaire I would think his touch\ncontamination. You have fallen through for once if you imagine I go out\nat night to meet any one--I merely go away to be free for a few minutes\nfrom the suffocating atmosphere of your odious home. You must not think\nthat because you have grasped and slaved and got a little money that it\nmakes a gentleman of you; and never you _dare_ to again mention my name\nin regard to matrimony with any one about here;\" and with my head high\nand shoulders thrown back I marched to my room, where I wept till I was\nweak and ill.\n\nThis monotonous sordid life was unhinging me, and there was no\nlegitimate way of escape from it. I formed wild plans of running away,\nto do what I did not care so long as it brought a little action,\nanything but this torturing maddening monotony; but my love for my\nlittle brothers and sisters held me back. I could not do anything that\nwould put me for ever beyond the pale of their society.\n\nI was so reduced in spirit that had Harold Beecham appeared then with a\nmatrimonial scheme to be fulfilled at once, I would have quickly erased\nthe fine lines I had drawn and accepted his proposal; but he did not\ncome, and I was unacquainted with his whereabouts or welfare. As I\nremembered him, how lovable and superior he seemed in comparison with\nthe men I met nowadays: not that he was any better than these men in\ntheir place and according to their lights, but his lights--at least not\nhis lights, for Harold Beecham was nothing of a philosopher, but the\nfurniture of the drawing-room which they illuminated--was more artistic.\nWhat a prince of gentlemanliness and winning gallantries he was in his\nquiet way!\n\nThis information concerning him was in a letter I received from my\ngrandmother at Easter:\n\n\nWho should surprise us with a visit the other day but Harold Beecham. He\nwas as thin as a whipping-post, and very sunburnt [I smiled, imagining\nit impossible for Harold to be any browner than of yore]. He has been\nnear death's door with the measles--caught them in Queensland while\ndroving, and got wet. He was so ill that he had to give up charge of\nthat 1600 head of cattle he was bringing. He came to say good-bye to us,\nas he is off to Western Australia next week to see if he can mend his\nfortunes there. I was afraid he was going to be like young Charters, and\nswear he would never come back unless he made a pile, but he says he\nwill be back next Christmas three years for certain, if he is alive and\nkicking, as he says himself.\n\nWhy he intends returning at that stipulated time I don't know, as he\nnever was very communicative, and is more unsociable than ever now. He\nis a man who never shows his feelings, but he must feel the loss of his\nold position deeply. He seemed surprised not to find you here, and says\nit was a pity to set you teaching, as it will take all the life and fun\nout of you, and that is the first time I ever heard him express an\nopinion in any one's business but his own. Frank Hawden sends kind\nregards, &c.\n\n\nTeaching certainly had the effect upon me anticipated by Harold Beecham,\nbut it was not the teaching but the place in which I taught which was\ndoing the mischief--good, my mother termed it.\n\nI was often sleepless for more than forty-eight hours at a stretch, and\ncried through the nights until my eyes had black rings round them, which\nwashing failed to remove. The neighbours described me as \"a sorrowful\nlookin' delicate creetur', that couldn't larf to save her life\"--quite a\ndifferent character to the girl who at Caddagat was continually chid for\nbeing a romp, a hoyden, a boisterous tomboy, a whirlwind, and for\nexcessive laughter at anything and everything. I got into such a state\nof nervousness that I would jump at the opening of a door or an\nunexpected footfall.\n\n\n\nWhen cooling down, after having so vigorously delivered Mr M'Swat a\npiece of my mind, I felt that I owed him an apology. According to his\nlights (and that is the only fair way of judging our fellows) he had\nacted in a kind of fatherly way. I was a young girl under his charge,\nand he would have in a measure been responsible had I come to harm\nthrough going out in the night. He had been good-natured, too, in\noffering to help things along by providing an eligible, and allowing us\nto \"spoon\" under his surveillance. That I was of temperament and\naspirations that made his plans loathsome to me was no fault of\nhis--only a heavy misfortune to myself. Yes; I had been in the wrong\nentirely.\n\nWith this idea in my head, sinking ankle-deep in the dust, and threading\nmy way through the pigs and fowls which hung around the back door, I\nwent in search of my master. Mrs M'Swat was teaching Jimmy how to kill a\nsheep and dress it for use; while Lizer, who was nurse to the baby and\nspectator of the performance, was volubly and ungrammatically giving\ninstructions in the art. Peter and some of the younger children were\naway felling stringybark-trees for the sustenance of the sheep. The fall\nof their axes and the murmur of the Murrumbidgee echoed faintly from the\nsunset. They would be home presently and at tea; I reflected it would be\n\"The old yeos looks terrible skinny, but the hoggets is fat yet. By\ncrikey! They did go into the bushes. They chawed up stems and all--some\nas thick as a pencil.\"\n\nThis information in that parlance had been given yesterday, the day\nbefore, would be given today, tomorrow, and the next day. It was the\nboss item on the conversational programme until further orders.\n\nI had a pretty good idea where to find Mr M'Swat, as he had lately\npurchased a pair of stud rams, and was in the habit of admiring them for\na couple of hours every evening. I went to where they usually grazed,\nand there, as I expected, found Mr M'Swat, pipe in mouth, with\nglistening eyes, surveying his darlings.\n\n\"Mr M'Swat, I have come to beg your pardon.\"\n\n\"That's all right, me gu-r-r-r-l. I didn't take no notice to anything ye\nmight spit out in a rage.\"\n\n\"But I was not in a rage. I meant every word I said, but I want to\napologize for the rude way in which I said it, as I had no right to\nspeak so to my elders. And I want to tell you that you need not fear me\nrunning away with Peter, even supposing he should honour me with his\naffections, as I am engaged to another man.\"\n\n\"By dad, I'll be hanged!\" he exclaimed, with nothing but curiosity on\nhis wrinkled dried tobacco-leaf-looking face. He expressed no resentment\non account of my behaviour to him.\n\n\"Are ye to be married soon? Has he got any prawperty? Who is he? I\nsuppose he's respectable. Ye're very young.\"\n\n\"Yes; he is renowned for respectability, but I am not going to marry him\ntill I am twenty-one. He is poor, but has good prospects. You must\npromise me not to tell anyone, as I wish it kept a secret, and only\nmention it to you so that you need not be disturbed about Peter.\"\n\nHe assured me that he would keep the secret, and I knew I could rely on\nhis word. He was greatly perturbed that my intended was poor.\n\n\"Never ye marry a man widout a bit er prawperty, me gu-r-r-r-l. Take my\nadvice--the divil's in a poor match, no matter how good the man may be.\nDon't ye be in a hurry; ye're personable enough in yer way, and there's\nas good fish in the seas as ever come out of 'em. Yer very small; I\nadmire a good lump of a woman meself--but don't ye lose heart. I've\nheerd some men say they like little girls, but, as I said, I like a good\nlump of a woman meself.\"\n\n\"And you've got a good lump of a squaw,\" I thought to myself.\n\nDo not mistake me. I do not for an instant fancy myself above the\nM'Swats. Quite the reverse; they are much superior to me. Mr M'Swat was\nupright and clean in his morals, and in his little sphere was as\nsensible and kind a man as one could wish for. Mrs M'Swat was faithful\nto him, contented and good-natured, and bore uncomplainingly, year after\nyear, that most cruelly agonising of human duties--childbirth, and did\nmore for her nation and her Maker than I will ever be noble enough to\ndo.\n\nBut I could not help it that their life was warping my very soul. Nature\nfashions us all; we have no voice in the matter, and I could not change\nmy organisation to one which would find sufficient sustenance in the\nmental atmosphere of Barney's Gap.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THIRTY-TWO\n\nTa-Ta to Barney's Gap\n\n\nIt chanced at last, as June gave place to July and July to August, that\nI could bear it no longer. I would go away even if I had to walk, and\nwhat I would do I did not know or care, my one idea being to leave\nBarney's Gap far and far behind. One evening I got a lot of letters from\nmy little brothers and sisters at home. I fretted over them a good deal,\nand put them under my pillow; and as I had not slept for nights, and was\nfeeling weak and queer, I laid my head upon them to rest a little before\ngoing out to get the tea ready. The next thing I knew was that Mrs\nM'Swat was shaking me vigorously with one hand, holding a flaring candle\nin the other, and saying:\n\n\"Lizer, shut the winder quick. She's been lyin' here in the draught till\nshe's froze, and must have the nightmare, the way she's been singin' out\nthat queer, an' I can't git her woke up. What ails ye, child? Are ye\nsick?\"\n\nI did not know what ailed me, but learnt subsequently that I laughed and\ncried very much, and pleaded hard with grannie and some Harold to save\nme, and kept reiterating, \"I cannot bear it, I cannot bear it,\" and\naltogether behaved so strangely that Mr M'Swat became so alarmed that he\nsent seventeen miles for the nearest doctor. He came next morning, felt\nmy pulse, asked a few questions, and stated that I was suffering from\nnervous prostration.\n\n\"Why, the child is completely run down, and in a fair way to contract\nbrain fever!\" he exclaimed. \"What has she been doing? It seems as though\nshe had been under some great mental strain. She must have complete rest\nand change, plenty of diversion and nourishing food, or her mind will\nbecome impaired.\"\n\nHe left me a bottle of tonic and Mr and Mrs M'Swat many fears. Poor\nkind-hearted souls, they got in a great state, and understood about as\nmuch of the cause of my breakdown as I do of the inside of the moon.\nThey ascribed it to the paltry amount of teaching and work I had done.\n\nMrs M'Swat killed a fowl and stewed it for my delectation. There was\npart of the inside with many feathers to flavour the dish, and having no\nappetite, I did not enjoy it, but made a feint of so doing to please the\ngood-natured cook.\n\nThey intended writing at once to give my parents notice when I would be\nput on the train. I was pronounced too ill to act as scribe; Lizer was\nsuggested, and then Jimmy, but M'Swat settled the matter thus:\n\n\"Sure, damn it! I'm the proper one to write on an important business\nmatther like this here.\"\n\nSo pens, ink, and paper were laid on the dining-room table, and the\ngreat proclamation went forth among the youngsters, \"Pa is goin' to\nwrite a whole letter all by hisself.\"\n\nMy door opened with the dining-room, and from my bed I could see the\nproceeding. Mr M'Swat hitched his trousers well through the saddle-strap\nwhich he always wore as a belt, took off his coat and folded it on the\nback of a chair, rolled his shirt-sleeves up to his elbows, pulled his\nhat well over his eyes, and \"shaped up\" to the writing material, none of\nwhich met with his approval. The ink was \"warter\", the pens had not\nenough \"pint\", and the paper was \"trash\"; but on being assured it was\nthe good stuff he had purchased especially for himself, he buckled to\nthe fray, producing in three hours a half-sheet epistle, which in\ngrammar, composition, and spelling quite eclipsed the entries in his\ndiary. However, it served its purpose, and my parents wrote back that,\ndid I reach Goulburn on a certain day, a neighbour who would be in town\nthen would bring me home.\n\nNow that it was settled that I had no more to teach the dirty children,\nout of dirty books, lessons for which they had great disinclination, and\nno more to direct Lizer's greasy fingers over the yellow keys of that\ndemented piano in a vain endeavour to teach her \"choones\", of which her\nmother expected her to learn on an average two daily, it seemed as\nthough I had a mountain lifted off me, and I revived magically, got out\nof bed and packed my things.\n\nI was delighted at the prospect of throwing off the leaden shackles of\nBarney's Gap, but there was a little regret mingled with my relief. The\nlittle boys had not been always bold. Did I express a wish for a\nparrot-wing or water-worn stone, or such like, after a time I would be\ncertain, on issuing from my bedroom, to find that it had been\nsurreptitiously laid there, and the little soft-eyed fellows would\nsquabble for the privilege of bringing me my post, simply to give me\npleasure. Poor little Lizer, and Rose Jane too, copied me in style of\ndress and manners in a way that was somewhat ludicrous but more\npathetic.\n\nThey clustered round to say good-bye. I would be sure to write. Oh yes,\nof course, and they would write in return and tell me if the bay mare\ngot well, and where they would find the yellow turkey-hen's nest. When I\ngot well I must come back, and I wouldn't have as much work to do, but\ngo for more rides to keep well, and so on. Mrs M'Swat very anxiously\nimpressed it upon me that I was to explain to my mother that it was not\nher (Mrs M'Swat's) fault that I \"ailed\" from overwork, as I had never\ncomplained and always seemed well.\n\nWith a kindly light on his homely sunburnt face, M'Swat said, as he put\nme on the train:\n\n\"Sure, tell yer father he needn't worry over the money. I'll never be\nhard on him, an' if ever I could help ye, I'd be glad.\"\n\n\"Thank you; you are very good, and have done too much already.\"\n\n\"Too much! Sure, damn it, wot's the good er bein' alive if we can't help\neach other sometimes. I don't mind how much I help a person if they have\na little gratitood, but, damn it, I can't abear ingratitood.\"\n\n\"Good-bye, Mr M'Swat, and thank you.\"\n\n\"Good-bye, me gu-r-r-r-l, and never marry that bloke of yours if he\ndon't git a bit er prawperty, for the divil's in a poor match.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THIRTY-THREE\n\nBack at Possum Gully\n\n\nThey were expecting me on the frosty evening in September, and the\nchildren came bounding and shouting to meet me, when myself and luggage\nwere deposited at Possum Gully by a neighbour, as he passed in a great\nhurry to reach his own home ere it got too dark. They bustled me to a\nglowing fire in no time.\n\nMy father sat reading, and, greeting me in a very quiet fashion,\ncontinued the perusal of his paper. My mother shut her lips tightly,\nsaying exultingly, \"It seems it was possible for you to find a worse\nplace than home\"; and that little speech was the thorn on the rose of my\nwelcome home. But there was no sting in Gertie's greeting, and how\nbeautiful she was growing, and so tall! It touched me to see she had\nmade an especial dainty for my tea, and had put things on the table\nwhich were only used for visitors. The boys and little Aurora chattered\nand danced around me all the while. One brought for my inspection some\nsoup-plates which had been procured during my absence; another came with\na picture-book; and nothing would do them but that I must, despite the\ndarkness, straightaway go out and admire a new fowl-house which \"Horace\nand Stanley built all by theirselves, and no one helped them one single\nbit.\"\n\nAfter Mrs M'Swat it was a rest, a relief, a treat, to hear my mother's\ncultivated voice, and observe her lady-like and refined figure as she\nmoved about; and, what a palace the place seemed in comparison to\nBarney's Gap! simply because it was clean, orderly, and bore traces of\nrefinement; for the stamp of indigent circumstances was legibly\nimprinted upon it, and many things which had been considered \"done for\"\nwhen thirteen months before I had left home, were still in use.\n\nI carefully studied my brothers and sisters. They had grown during my\nabsence, and were all big for their age, and though some of them not\nexactly handsome, yet all pleasant to look upon--I was the only wanting\nin physical charms--also they were often discontented, and wished, as\nchildren will, for things they could not have; but they were natural,\nunderstandable children, not like myself, cursed with a fevered ambition\nfor the utterly unattainable.\n\n    \"Oh, were I seated high as my ambition,\n     I'd place this loot on naked necks of monarchs!\"\n\nAt the time of my departure for Caddagat my father had been negotiating\nwith beer regarding the sale of his manhood; on returning I found that\nhe had completed the bargain, and held a stamped receipt in his\nmiserable appearance and demeanour. In the broken-down man, regardless\nof manners, one would have failed to recognize Dick Melvyn, \"Smart Dick\nMelvyn\", \"Jolly-good-fellow Melvyn\" \"Thorough Gentleman\" and \"Manly\nMelvyn\" of the handsome face and ingratiating manners, one-time holder\nof Bruggabrong, Bin Bin East, and Bin Bin West. He never corrected his\nfamily nowadays, and his example was most deleterious to them.\n\nMother gave me a list of her worries in private after tea that night.\nShe wished she had never married: not only was her husband a failure,\nbut to all appearances her children would be the same. I wasn't worth my\nsalt or I would have remained at Barney's Gap; and there was\nHorace--heaven only knew where he would end. God would surely punish him\nfor his disrespect to his father. It was impossible to keep things\ntogether much longer, etc., etc.\n\nWhen we went to bed that night Gertie poured all her troubles into my\near in a jumbled string. It was terrible to have such a father. She was\nashamed of him. He was always going into town, and stayed there till\nmother had to go after him, or some of the neighbours were so good as to\nbring him home. It took all the money to pay the publican's bills, and\nGertie was ashamed to be seen abroad in the nice clothes which grannie\nsent, as the neighbours said the Melvyns ought to pay up the old man's\nbills instead of dressing like swells; and she couldn't help it, and she\nwas sick and tired of trying to keep up respectability in the teeth of\nsuch odds.\n\nI comforted her with the assurance that the only thing was to feel right\nwithin ourselves, and let people say whatsoever entertained their poor\nlittle minds. And I fell asleep thinking that parents have a duty to\nchildren greater than children to parents, and they who do not fulfil\ntheir responsibility in this respect are as bad in their morals as a\ndebauchee, corrupt the community as much as a thief, and are among the\nablest underminers of their nation.\n\nOn the morrow, the first time we were alone, Horace seized the\nopportunity of holding forth on _his_ woes. It was no use, he was choke\nfull of Possum Gully: he would stick to it for another year, and then he\nwould chuck it, even if he had to go on the wallaby. He wasn't going to\nbe slaving for ever for the boss to swallow the proceeds, and there was\nnothing to be made out of dairying. When it wasn't drought it was floods\nand caterpillars and grasshoppers.\n\n\n\nAmong my brothers and sisters I quickly revived to a certain extent, and\nmother asserted her opinion that I had not been ill at all, but had made\nup my mind to torment her; had not taken sufficient exercise, and might\nhave had a little derangement of the system but nothing more. It was\nproposed that I should return to Barney's Gap. I demurred, and was\nanathematized as ungrateful and altogether corrupt, that I would not go\nback to M'Swat, who was so good as to lend my father money out of pure\nfriendship; but for once in my life I could not be made submit by either\ncoercion or persuasion. Grannie offered to take one of us to Caddagat;\nmother preferred that Gertie should go. So we sent the pretty girl to\ndwell among her kindred in a land of comfort and pleasure.\n\nI remained at Possum Gully to tread the same old life in its tame narrow\npath, with its never-ending dawn-till-daylight round of tasks; with, as\nits entertainments, an occasional picnic or funeral or a day in town,\nwhen, should it happen to be Sunday, I never fail to patronize one of\nthe cathedrals. I love the organ music, and the hush which pervades the\nbuilding; and there is much entertainment in various ways if one goes\nearly and watches the well-dressed congregation filing in. The costumes\nand the women are pretty, and, in his own particular line, the ability\nof the verger is something at which to marvel. Regular attendants, of\ncourse, pay for and have reserved their seats, but it is in classing the\nvisitors that the verger displays his talent. He can cull the commoners\nfrom the parvenu aristocrats, and put them in their respective places as\nskilfully as an expert horse-dealer can draft his stock at a sale. Then,\nwhen the audience is complete, in the middle and front of the edifice\nare to be found they of the white hands and fine jewels; and in the\ntopmost seat of the synagogue, praying audibly, is one who has made all\nhis wealth by devouring widows' houses; while pushed away to the corners\nand wings are they who earn their bread by the sweat of their brow; and\nthose who cannot afford good linen are too proud to be seen here at all.\n\n\"The choir sings and the organ rings,\" the uninteresting prayers are\nrattled off (\"O come, let us worship, and fall down: and kneel before\nthe Lord, our Maker\"); a sermon, mostly of the debts of the concern, of\nthe customs of the ancients, or of the rites and ceremonies of\nup-to-date churchism, is delivered, and the play is done, and as I leave\nthe building a great hunger for a little Christianity fills my heart.\n\nOh that a preacher might arise and expound from the Book of books a\nreligion with a God, a religion with a heart in it--a Christian\nreligion, which would abolish the cold legend whose centre is\nrespectability, and which rears great buildings in which the rich\nrecline on silken hassocks while the poor perish in the shadow thereof.\n\n\n\nThrough the hot dry summer, then the heartless winter and the scorching\nsummer again which have spent themselves since Gertie's departure, I\nhave struggled hard to do my duty in that state of life unto which it\nhad pleased God to call me, and sometimes I have partially succeeded. I\nhave had no books or papers, nothing but peasant surroundings and\npeasant tasks, and have encouraged peasant ignorance--ignorance being\nthe mainspring of contentment, and contentment the bed-rock of\nhappiness; but it is all to no purpose. A note from the other world will\nstrike upon the chord of my being, and the spirit which has been dozing\nwithin me awakens and fiercely beats at its bars, demanding some nobler\nthought, some higher aspiration, some wider action, a more saturnalian\npleasure, something more than the peasant life can ever yield. Then I\nhold my spirit tight till wild passionate longing sinks down, down to\nsickening dumb despair, and had I the privilege extended to job of\nold--to curse God and die--I would leap at it eagerly.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THIRTY-FOUR\n\nBut Absent Friends are Soon Forgot\n\n\nWe received a great many letters from Gertie for a little while after\nshe went up the country, but they grew shorter and farther between as\ntime went on.\n\nIn one of grannie's letters there was concerning my sister: \"I find\nGertie is a much younger girl for her age than Sybylla was, and not\nnearly so wild and hard to manage. She is a great comfort to me. Every\none remarks upon her good looks.\"\n\nFrom one of Gertie's letters:\n\n\nUncle Julius came home from Hong Kong and America last week, and brought\nsuch a lot of funny presents for every one. He had a lot for you, but he\nhas given them to me instead as you are not here. He calls me his pretty\nlittle sunbeam, and says I must always live with him.\n\n\nI sighed to myself as I read this. Uncle Jay-Jay had said much the same\nto me, and where was I now? My thoughts were ever turning to the people\nand old place I love so well, but Gertie's letters showed me that I was\nutterly forgotten and unmissed.\n\nGertie left us in October 1897, and it was somewhere about January 1898\nthat all the letters from Caddagat were full to overflowing with the\nwonderful news of Harold Beecham's reinstatement at Five-Bob Downs,\nunder the same conditions as he had held sway there in my day.\n\nFrom grannie's letters I learnt that some old sweetheart of Harold's\nfather had bequeathed untold wealth to this her lost love's son. The\nwealth was in bonds and stocks principally, and though it would be some\ntime ere Harold was actually in possession of it, yet he had no\ndifficulty in getting advancements to any amount, and had immediately\nrepurchased Five-Bob.\n\nI had never dreamed of such a possibility. True, I had often said were\nHarold a character in fiction instead of real life, some relative would\ndie opportunely and set him up in his former position, but, here, this\nutterly unanticipated contingency had arisen in a manner which would\naffect my own life, and what were my feelings regarding the matter?\n\nI think I was not fully aware of the extent of my lack of wifely love\nfor Harold Beecham, until experiencing the sense of relief which stole\nover me on holding in my hand the announcement of his return to the\nsmile of fortune.\n\nHe was rich; he would not need me now; my obligation to him ceased to\nexist; I was free. He would no longer wish to be hampered with me. He\ncould take his choice of beauty and worth; he might even purchase a\nprincess did his ambition point that way.\n\nOne of Gertie's letters ran:\n\n\nThat Mr Beecham you used to tell me so much about has come back to live\nat Five-Bob. He has brought his aunts back. Every one went to welcome\nthem, and there was a great fuss. Aunt Helen says he (Mr B.) is very\nconservative; he has everything just as it used to be. I believe he is\nricher than ever. Every one is laughing about his luck. He was here\ntwice last week, and has just left this evening. He is very quiet. I\ndon't know how you thought him so wonderful. I think he is too slow, I\nhave great work to talk to him, but he is very kind, and I like him. He\nseems to remember you well, and often says you were a game youngster,\nand could ride like old Nick himself.\n\n\nI wrote to the owner of Five-Bob desiring to know if what I heard\nconcerning his good fortune was correct, and he replied by return post:\n\n\nMy dear little Syb,\n\nYes, thank goodness it is all true. The old lady left me nearly a\nmillion. It seems like a fairy yarn, and I will know how to value it\nmore now. I would have written sooner, only you remember our bargain,\nand I was just waiting to get things fixed up a little, when I'm off at\ngreat tracks to claim you in the flesh, as there is no need for us to\nwait above a month or two now if you are agreeable. I am just run to\ndeath. It takes a bit of jigging to get things straight again, but it's\nsimply too good to believe to be back in the same old beat. I've seen\nGertie a good many times, and find your descriptions of her were not at\nall overdrawn. I won't send any love in this, or there would be a \"bust\nup\" in the post-office, because I'd be sure to overdo the thing, and I'd\nhave all the officials on to me for damages. Gather up your goods and\nchattels, because I'll be along in a week or two to take possession of\nyou.\n\n--Yr devoted\n\nHal.\n\n\nI screwed the letter in two and dropped it into the kitchen-fire.\n\nI knew Harold meant what he had said. He was a strong-natured man of\nfirm determinations, and having made up his mind to marry me would never\nfor an instant think of anything else; but I could see what he could not\nsee himself--that he had probably tired of me, and was becoming\nenamoured of Gertie's beauty.\n\nThe discordance of life smote hard upon me, and the letter I wrote was\nnot pleasant. It ran:\n\n    To H. A. BEECHAM, Esq.,\n      Five-Bob Downs Station,\n        Gool-Gool, N.S.W.\n\nSir,\n\nYour favour duly to hand. I heartily rejoice at your good fortune, and\ntrust you may live long and have health to enjoy it. Do not for an\ninstant consider yourself under any obligations to me, for you are\nperfectly free. Choose some one who will reflect more credit on your\ntaste and sense.\n\n    With all good wishes,\n      Faithfully yrs,\n        S. PENELOPE MELVYN.\n\nAs I closed and directed this how far away Harold Beecham seemed! Less\nthan two years ago I had been familiar with every curve and expression\nof his face, every outline of his great figure, every intonation of his\nstrong cultivated voice; but now he seemed as the shadow of a former\nage.\n\nHe wrote in reply: What did I mean? Was it a joke--just a little of my\nold tormenting spirit? Would I explain immediately? He couldn't get down\nto see me for a fortnight at the least. .\n\nI explained, and very tersely, that I had meant what I said, and in\nreturn received a letter as short as my own:\n\n\nDEAR MISS MELVYN,\n\nI regret your decision, but trust I have sufficient manhood to prevent\nme from thrusting myself upon any lady, much less you.\n\n    Your sincere friend,\n      HAROLD AUGUSTUS BEECHAM.\n\nHe did not demand a reason for my decision, but accepted it\nunquestionably. As I read his words he grew near to me, as in the days\ngone by.\n\nI closed my eyes, and before my mental vision there arose an overgrown\nold orchard, skirting one of the great stock-routes from Riverina to\nMonaro. A glorious day was languidly smiling good night on abundance of\nripe and ripening fruit and flowers. The scent of stock and the merry\ncry of the tennis-players filled the air. I could feel Harold's wild\njolting heart-beats, his burning breath on my brow, and his voice husky\nwith rage in my ear. As he wrote that letter I could fancy the well-cut\nmouth settling into a sullen line, as it had done on my birthday when,\nby caressing, I had won it back to its habitual pleasant expression; but\non this occasion I would not be there. He would be angry just a little\nwhile--a man of his strength and importance could not long hold ill-will\ntowards a woman, a girl, a child! as weak and insignificant as I. Then\nwhen I should meet him in the years to come, when he would be the\nfaithful and loving husband of another woman, he would be a little\nembarrassed perhaps; but I would set him at his case, and we would laugh\ntogether re what he would term our foolish young days, and he would like\nme in a brotherly way. Yes, that was how it would be. The tiny note\nblackened in the flames.\n\nSo much for my romance of love! It had ended in a bottle of smoke, as\nall my other dreams of life bid fair to do.\n\nI think I was not fully aware how near I had been to loving Harold\nBeecham until experiencing the sense of loss which stole over me on\nholding in my hand the acceptance of his dismissal. It was a something\ngone out of my life, which contained so few somethings, that I\ncrushingly felt the loss of any one.\n\n\n\nOur greatest heart-treasure is a knowledge that there is in creation an\nindividual to whom our existence is necessary--some one who is part of\nour life as we are part of theirs, some one in whose life we feel\nassured our death would leave a gap for a day or two. And who can be\nthis but a husband or wife? Our parents have other children and\nthemselves, our brothers and sisters marry and have lives apart, so with\nour friends; but one's husband would be different. And I had thrown\nbehind me this chance; but in the days that followed I knew that I had\nacted wisely.\n\nGertie's letters would contain: \"Harold Beecham, he makes me call him\nHarry, took me to Five-Bob last week, and it was lovely fun.\"\n\nAgain it would be: \"Harry says I am the prettiest little girl ever was,\nCaddagat or anywhere else, and he gave me such a lovely bracelet. I wish\nyou could see it.\"\n\nOr this:\n\n\nWe all went to church yesterday. Harry rode with me. There is to be a\nvery swell ball at Wyambeet next month, and Harry says I am to keep\nnearly all my dances for him. Frank Hawden sailed for England last week.\nWe have a new jackeroo. He is better-looking than Frank, but I don't\nlike him as well.\n\n\nGrannie's and aunt Helen's letters to my mother corroborated these\nadmissions. Grannie wrote:\n\n\nHarry Beecham seems to be very much struck with Gertie. I think it would\nbe a good thing, as he is immensely rich, and a very steady young fellow\ninto the bargain. They say no woman could live with him on account of\nhis temper; but he has always been a favourite of mine, and we cannot\nexpect a man without some faults.\n\n\nAunt Helen remarked:\n\n\nDon't be surprised if you have young Beecham down there presently on an\n\"asking papa\" excursion. He spends a great deal of time here, and has\nbeen inquiring the best route to Possum Gully. Do you remember him? I\ndon't think he was here in your day. He is an estimable and likeable\nyoung fellow, and I think will make a good husband apart from his\nwealth. He and Gertie present a marked contrast.\n\n\nSometimes on reading this kind of thing I would wax rather bitter. Love,\nI said, was not a lasting thing; but knowledge told me that it was for\nthose of beauty and winsome ways, and not for me. I was ever to be a\nlonely-hearted waif from end to end of the world of love--an alien among\nmy own kin.\n\nBut there were other things to worry me. Horace had left the family\nroof. He averred he was \"full up of life under the old man's rule. It\nwas too slow and messed up.\" His uncle, George Melvyn, his father's\neldest brother, who had so often and so kindly set us up with cows, had\noffered to take him, and his father had consented to let him go. George\nMelvyn had a large station outback, a large sheep-shearing machine, and\nother improvements. Thence, strong in the hope of sixteen years, Horace\nset out on horseback one springless spring morning ere the sun had\nrisen, with all his earthly possessions strapped before him. Bravely the\nhorse stepped out for its week's journey, and bravely its rider sat,\nleaving me and the shadeless, wooden sun-baked house on the side of the\nhill, with the regretlessness of teens--especially masculine teens. I\nwatched him depart until the clacking of his horse's hoofs grew faint on\nthe stony hillside and his form disappeared amid the she-oak scrub which\ncrowned the ridge to the westward. He was gone. Such is life. I sat down\nand buried my face in my apron, too miserable even for tears. Here was\nanother article I ill could spare wrenched from my poorly and sparsely\nfurnished existence.\n\nTrue, our intercourse had not always been carpeted with rose-leaves. His\npitiless scorn of my want of size and beauty had often given me a\nsleepless night; but I felt no bitterness against him for this, but\nmerely cursed the Potter who had fashioned the clay that was thus\ndescribed.\n\nOn the other hand, he was the only one who had ever stood up and said a\nword of extenuation for me in the teeth of a family squall. Father did\nnot count; my mother thought me bad from end to end; Gertie, in addition\nto the gifts of beauty and lovableness, possessed that of holding with\nthe hare and running with the hound; but Horace once had put in a word\nfor me that I would never forget. I missed his presence in the house,\nhis pounding of the old piano with four dumb notes in the middle, as he\nbawled thereto rollicking sea and comic songs; I missed his energetic\ndissertations on spurs, whips, and blood-horses, and his spirited\nrendering of snatches of Paterson and Gordon, as he came in and out,\nbanging doors and gates, teasing the cats and dogs and tormenting the\nchildren.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE\n\nThe 3rd of December 1898\n\n\nIt was a very hot day. So extreme was the heat that to save the lives of\nsome young swallows my father had to put wet bags over the iron roof\nabove their nest. A galvanized-iron awning connected our kitchen and\nhouse: in this some swallows had built, placing their nest so near the\niron that the young ones were baking with the heat until rescued by the\nwet bagging. I had a heavy day's work before me, and, from my exertions\nof the day before, was tired at the beginning. Bush-fires had been\nraging in the vicinity during the week, and yesterday had come so close\nthat I had been called out to carry buckets of water all the afternoon\nin the blazing sun. The fire had been allayed, after making a gap in one\nof our boundary fences. Father and the boys had been forced to leave the\nharvesting of the miserable pinched wheat while they went to mend it, as\nthe small allowance of grass the drought gave us was precious, and had\nto be carefully preserved from neighbours' stock.\n\nI had baked and cooked, scrubbed floors and whitewashed hearths, scoured\ntinware and cutlery, cleaned windows, swept yards, and discharged\nnumerous miscellaneous jobs, and half-past two in the afternoon found me\nvery dirty and very tired, and with very much more yet to do.\n\nOne of my half-starved poddy calves was very ill, and I went out to\ndoctor it previous to bathing and tidying myself for my finishing\nhousehold duties.\n\nMy mother was busy upon piles and piles of wearying mending, which was\none of the most hopeless of the many slaveries of her life. This was\nhard work, and my father was slaving away in the sun, and mine was\narduous labour, and it was a very hot day, and a drought-smitten and a\nlong day, and poddy calves ever have a tendency to make me moralize and\nsnarl. This was life, my life and my parents' life, and the life of\nthose around us, and if I was a good girl and honoured my parents I\nwould be rewarded with a long stretch of it. Yah!\n\nThese pagan meditations were interrupted by a footfall slowly\napproaching. I did not turn to ascertain who it might be, but trusted it\nwas no one of importance, as the poddy and I presented rather a\ngrotesque appearance. It was one of the most miserable and sickly of its\nmiserable kind, and I was in the working uniform of the Australian\npeasantry. My tattered skirt and my odd and bursted boots, laced with\ntwine, were spattered with whitewash, for coolness my soiled cotton\nblouse hung loose, an exceedingly dilapidated sun-bonnet surmounted my\nhead, and a bottle of castor-oil was in my hand.\n\nI supposed it was one of the neighbours or a tea-agent, and I would send\nthem to mother.\n\nThe footsteps had come to a halt beside me.\n\n\"Could you tell me if--\"\n\nI glanced upwards. Horrors! There stood Harold Beecham, as tall and\nbroad as of yore, even more sunburnt than ever, and looking very stylish\nin a suit of grey and a soft fashionable dinted-in hat; and it was the\nfirst time I had ever seen him in a white shirt and high collar.\n\nI wished he would explode, or I might sink into the ground, or the calf\nwould disappear, or that something might happen.\n\nOn recognizing me his silence grew profound, but an unmistakable\nexpression of pity filled his eyes and stung me to the quick.\n\nI have a faculty of self-pity, but my pride promptly refuses the\nslightest offer of sympathy from another.\n\nI could feel my heart grow as bitterly cold as my demeanour was icily\nstiff, when I stood up and said curtly:\n\n\"This is a great surprise, Mr Beecham.\"\n\n\"Not an unpleasant one, I hope,\" he said pleasantly.\n\n\"We will not discuss the matter. Come inside out of the heat.\"\n\n\"I'm in no hurry, Syb, and couldn't I help you with that poor little\ndevil?\"\n\n\"I'm only trying to give it another chance of life.\"\n\n\"What will you do with it if it lives?\"\n\n\"Sell it for half a crown when it's a yearling.\"\n\n\"It would pay better to shoot the poor little beggar now.\"\n\n\"No doubt it would the owner of Five-Bob, but we have to be more\ncareful,\" I said tartly.\n\n\"I didn't mean to offend you.\"\n\n\"I'm not offended,\" I returned, leading the way to the house, imagining\nwith a keen pain that Harold Beecham must be wondering how for an\ninstant he could have been foolish enough to fancy such an object two\nyears ago.\n\nThank goodness I have never felt any humiliation on account of my\nmother, and felt none then, as she rose to greet Harold upon my\nintroduction. She was a lady, and looked it, in spite of the piles of\ncoarse mending, and the pair of trousers, almost bullet-proof with\npatches, out of which she drew her hand, roughened and reddened with\nhard labour, in spite of her patched and faded cotton gown, and the\ncommonest and most poverty-stricken of peasant surroundings, which\nfailed to hide that she had not been always thus.\n\nLeaving them together, I expeditiously proceeded to relieve the\nlivery-stable horse, on which Harold had come, of the valise, saddle,\nand bridle with which it was encumbered, and then let it loose in one of\nthe grassless paddocks near at hand.\n\nThen I threw myself on a stool in the kitchen, and felt, to the bone,\nthe sting of having ideas above one's position.\n\nIn a few minutes mother came hurrying out.\n\n\"Good gracious, what's the matter? I suppose you didn't like being\ncaught in such a pickle, but don't get in the dumps about it. I'll get\nhim some tea while you clean yourself, and then you'll be able to help\nme by and by.\"\n\nI found my little sister Aurora, and we climbed through the window into\nmy bedroom to get tidy. I put a pair of white socks and shoes and a\nclean pinafore on the little girl, and combed her golden curls. She was\nall mine--slept with me, obeyed me, championed me; while I--well, I\nworshipped her.\n\nThere was a hole in the wall, and through it I could see without being\nseen.\n\nMother was dispensing afternoon tea and talking to Harold. It was\npleasant to see that manly figure once again. My spirits rose\nconsiderably. After all, if the place was poor, it was very clean, as I\nhad scrubbed it all that morning, and when I came to consider the\nmatter, I remembered that men weren't such terrible creatures, and never\nmade one feel the sting of one's poverty half as much as women do.\n\n\"Aurora,\" I said, I want you to go out and tell Mr Beecham something.\n\nThe little girl assented. I carefully instructed her in what she was to\nsay, and dispatched her. She placed herself in front of Harold--a\nwide-eyed mite of four, that scarcely reached above his knee--and\nclasping her chubby hands behind her, gazed at him fearlessly and\nunwinkingly.\n\n\"Aurora, you mustn't stand staring like that,\" said mother.\n\n\"Yes, I must,\" she replied confidently.\n\n\"Well, and what's your name?\" said Harold laughingly.\n\n\"Aurora and Roy. I belong to Sybyller, and got to tell you somesing.\"\n\n\"Have you? Let's hear it.\"\n\n\"Sybyller says you's Mr Beecher; when you're done tea, you'd like me if\nI would to 'scort you to farver and the boys, and 'duce you.\"\n\nMother laughed. \"That's some of Sybylla's nonsense. She considers Rory\nher especial property, and delights to make the child attempt long\nwords. Perhaps you would care to take a stroll to where they are at\nwork, by and by.\"\n\nHarold said he would go at once, and accepting Rory's escort, and with a\nfew directions from mother, they presently set out--she importantly\ntrudging beneath a big white sun-bonnet, and he looking down at her in\namusement. Presently he tossed her high above his head, and depositing\nher upon his shoulder, held one sturdy brown leg in his browner hand,\nwhile she held on by his hair.\n\n\"My first impressions are very much in his favour,\" said mother, when\nthey had got out of hearing. \"But fancy Gertie the wife of that great\nman!\"\n\n\"She is four inches taller than I am,\" I snapped. \"And if he was as big\nas a gum-tree, he would be a man all the same, and just as soft on a\npretty face as all the rest of them.\"\n\n\n\nI bathed, dressed, arranged my hair, got something ready for tea, and\nprepared a room for our visitor. For this I collected from all parts of\nthe house--a mat from one room, a toilet-set from another, and so\non--till I had quite an elaborately furnished chamber ready for my\none-time lover.\n\nThey returned at dusk, Rory again seated on Harold's shoulder, and two\nof the little boys clinging around him.\n\nAs I conducted him to his room I was in a different humour from that of\nthe sweep-like object who had met him during the afternoon. I laughed to\nmyself, for, as on a former occasion during our acquaintance, I felt I\nwas master of the situation.\n\n\"I say, Syb, don't treat a fellow as though he was altogether a\nstranger,\" he said diffidently, leaning against the door-post.\n\nOur hands met in a cordial grasp as I said, \"I'm awfully glad to see\nyou, Hal; but, but----\"\n\n\"But what?\"\n\n\"I didn't feel over delighted to be caught in such a stew this\nafternoon.\"\n\n\"Nonsense! It only reminded me of the first time we met,\" he said with a\ntwinkle in his eye. \"That's always the way with you girls. You can't be\ncivil to a man unless you're dressed up fit to stun him, as though you\ncouldn't make fool enough of him without the aid of clothes at all.\"\n\n\"You'd better shut up,\" I said over my shoulder as I departed, \"or you\nwill be saying something better left unsaid, like at our first meeting.\nDo you remember?\"\n\n\"Do I not? Great Scot, it's just like old times to have you giving me\nimpudence over your shoulder like that!\" he replied merrily.\n\n\"Like, yet unlike,\" I retorted with a sigh.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THIRTY-SIX\n\nOnce Upon a Time, when the days were long and hot\n\n\nNext day was Sunday--a blazing one it was too. I proposed that in the\nafternoon some of us should go to church. Father sat upon the idea as a\nmad one. Walk two miles in such heat for nothing! as walk we would be\ncompelled to do, horseflesh being too precious in such a drought to\nfritter it away in idle jaunts. Surprising to say, however, Harold, who\nnever walked anywhere when he could get any sort of a horse, uttered a\nwish to go. Accordingly, when the midday dinner was over, he, Stanley,\nand I set out. Going to church was quite the event of the week to the\nresidents around Possum Gully. It was a small Dissenting chapel, where a\nlayman ungrammatically held forth at 3 p.m. every Sunday; but the\ncongregation was composed of all denominations, who attended more for\nthe sitting about on logs outside, and yarning about the price of\nbutter, the continuance of the drought, and the latest gossip, before\nand after the service, than for the service itself.\n\nI knew the appearance of Harold Beecham, would make quite a miniature\nsensation, and form food for no end of conjecture and chatter. In any\ncompany he was a distinguished-looking man, and particularly so among\nthese hard-worked farmer-selectors, on whose careworn features the cruel\neffects of the drought were leaving additional lines of worry. I felt\nproud of my quondam sweetheart. There was an unconscious air of physical\nlordliness about him, and he looked such a swell--not the black-clothed,\nclean-shaved, great display of white collar-and-cuffs swell appertaining\nto the office and city street, but of the easy sunburnt squatter type of\nswelldom, redolent of the sun, the saddle, the wide open country--a man\nwho is a man, utterly free from the least suspicion of effeminacy, and\ncapable of earning his bread by the sweat of his brow--with an arm ready\nand willing to save in an accident.\n\nAll eyes were turned on us as we approached, and I knew that the\nattentions he paid me out of simple courtesy--tying my shoe, carrying my\nbook, holding my parasol--would be put down as those of a lover.\n\nI introduced him to a group of men who were sitting on a log, under the\nshade of a stringybark, and leaving him to converse with them, made my\nway to where the women sat beneath a gum-tree. The children made a third\ngroup at some distance. We always divided ourselves thus. A young fellow\nhad to be very far gone ere he was willing to run the gauntlet of all\nthe chaff levelled at him had he the courage to single out a girl and\ntalk to her.\n\nI greeted all the girls and women, beginning at the great-grandmother of\nthe community, who illustrated to perfection the grim sarcasm of the\nfifth commandment. She had worked hard from morning till night, until\ntoo old to do so longer, and now hung around with aching weariness\nwaiting for the grave. She generally poured into my ears a wail about\nher \"rheumatisms\", and \"How long it do be waiting for the Lord\"; but\ntoday she was too curious about Harold to think of herself.\n\n\"Sure, Sybyller, who's that? Is he yer sweetheart? Sure he's as fine a\nman as iver I clapped me eyes on.\"\n\nI proceeded to give his pedigree, but was interrupted by the arrival of\nthe preacher, and we all went into the weatherboard iron-roofed house of\nprayer.\n\nAfter service, one of the girls came up to me and whispered, \"that is\nyour sweetheart, isn't it, Sybyller? He was looking at you all the time\nin church.\"\n\n\"Oh dear, no! I'll introduce him to you.\"\n\nI did so, and watched him as they made remarks about the heat and\ndrought. There was nothing of the cad or snob about him, and his short\nseason of adversity had rubbed all the little crudities off his\ncharacter, leaving him a man that the majority of both sexes would\nadmire: women for his bigness, his gentleness, his fine brown\nmoustache--and for his wealth; men, because he was a manly fellow.\n\nI know he had walked to church on purpose to get a chance of speaking to\nme about Gertie, before approaching her parents on the matter; but\nStanley accompanied us, and, boy-like, never relaxed in vigilance for an\ninstant, so there was no opportunity for anything but matter-of-fact\nremarks. The heat was intense. We wiped the perspiration and flies from\nour face frequently, and disturbed millions of grasshoppers as we\nwalked. They had devoured all the fruit in the orchards about, and had\neven destroyed many of the trees by eating the bark, and now they were\nstripping the briers of foliage. In one orchard we passed, the apricot,\nplum, and peach-stones hung naked on their leafless trees as evidence of\ntheir ravages. It was too hot to indulge in any but the most desultory\nconversation. We dawdled along. A tiger-snake crossed our path. Harold\nprocured a stick and killed it, and Stanley hung it on the top wire of a\nfence which was near at hand. After this we discussed snakes for a few\nyards.\n\nA blue sea-breeze, redolent of the bush-fires which were raging at\nTocumwal and Bombala, came rushing and roaring over the ranges from the\ncast, and enshrouded the scene in its heavy fog-like folds. The sun was\nobscured, and the temperature suddenly took such a great drop that I\nfelt chilled in my flimsy clothing, and I noticed Harold draw his coat\ntogether.\n\nStanley had to go after the cows, which were little better than walking\nhides, yet were yarded morning and evening to yield a dribble of milk.\nHe left us among some sallie-trees, in a secluded nook, walled in by\nbriers, and went across the paddock to roundup the cows. Harold and I\ncame to a halt by tacit consent.\n\n\"Syb, I want to speak to you,\" he said earnestly, and then came to a\ndead stop.\n\n\"Very well; 'tear into it,' as Horace would say; but if it is anything\nfrightful, break it gently,\" I said flippantly.\n\n\"Surely, Syb, you can guess what it is I have to say.\"\n\nYes, I could guess, I knew what he was going to say, and the knowledge\nleft a dull bitterness at my heart. I knew he was going to tell me that\nI had been right and he wrong--that he had found some one he loved\nbetter than me, and that some one being my sister, he felt I needed some\nexplanation before he could go in and win; and though I had refused him\nfor want of love, yet it gave me pain when the moment arrived that the\nonly man who had ever pretended to love me was going to say he had been\nmistaken, and preferred my sister.\n\nThere was silence save for the whirr of the countless grasshoppers in\nthe brier bushes. I knew he was expecting me to help him out, but I felt\ndoggedly savage and wouldn't. I looked up at him. He was a tall grand\nman, and honest and true and rich. He loved my sister; she would marry\nhim, and they would be happy. I thought bitterly that God was good to\none and cruel to another--not that I wanted this man, but why was I so\ndifferent from other girls?\n\nBut then I thought of Gertie, so pretty, so girlish, so understandable,\nso full of innocent winning coquetry. I softened. Could any one help\npreferring her to me, who was strange, weird, and perverse--too\noutspoken to be engaging, devoid of beauty and endearing little ways? It\nwas my own misfortune and nobody's fault that my singular individuality\nexcluded me from the ordinary run of youthful joyous-heartednesses, and\nwhy should I be nasty to these young people?\n\nI was no heroine, only a common little bush-girl, so had to make the\nbest of the situation without any fooling. I raised my eyes from the\nscanty baked wisps of grass at my feet, placed my hand on Hal's arm, and\ntiptoeing so as to bring my five-foot stature more on a level with his,\nsaid:\n\n\"Yes, Hal, I know what you want to say. Say it all. I won't be nasty.\"\n\n\"Well, you see you are so jolly touchy, and have snubbed me so often,\nthat I don't know how to begin; and if you know what I'm going to say,\nwon't you give me an answer without hearing it?\"\n\n\"Yes, Hal; but you'd better say it, as I don't know what conditions--\"\n\n\"Conditions!\"--catching me up eagerly at the word. \"If it is only\nconditions that are stopping you, you can make your own conditions if\nyou will marry me.\"\n\n\"Marry you, Harold! What do you mean? Do you know what you are saying?\"\nI exclaimed.\n\n\"There!\" he replied: \"I knew you would take it as an insult. I believe\nyou are the proudest girl in the world. I know you are too clever for\nme; but I love you, and could give you everything you fancied.\"\n\n\"Hal, dear, let me explain. I'm not insulted, only surprised. I thought\nyou were going to tell me that you loved Gertie, and would ask me not to\nmake things unpleasant by telling her of the foolish little bit of\nflirtation there had been between us.\"\n\n\"Marry Gertie! Why, she's only a child! A mere baby, in fact. Marry\nGertie! I never thought of her in that light; and did you think I was\nthat sort of a fellow, Syb?\" he asked reproachfully.\n\n\"No, Hal,\" I promptly made answer. \"I did not think you were that sort\nof fellow; but I thought that was the only sort of fellow there was.\"\n\n\"Good heavens, Syb! Did you really mean those queer little letters you\nwrote me last February? I never for an instant looked upon them as\nanything but a little bit of playful contrariness. And have you\nforgotten me? Did you not mean your promise of two years ago, that you\nspeak of what passed between us as a paltry bit of flirtation? Is that\nall you thought it?\"\n\n\"No, I did not consider it flirtation; but that is what I thought you\nwould term it when announcing your affection for Gertie.\"\n\n\"Gertie! Pretty little Gertie! I never looked upon the child as anything\nbut your sister, consequently mine also. She's a child.\"\n\n\"Child! She is eighteen. More than a year older than I was when you\nfirst introduced the subject of matrimony to me, and she is very\nbeautiful, and twenty times as good and lovable as I could ever be even\nin my best moments.\"\n\n\"Yes, I know you are young in years, but there is nothing of the child\nin you. As for beauty, it is nothing. If beauty was all a man required,\nhe could, if rich, have a harem full of it any day. I want some one to\nbe true.\"\n\n    \"The world is filled with folly and sin,\n       And love must cling where it can, I say;\n     For beauty is easy enough to win,\n       But one isn't loved every day,\"\n\nI quoted from Owen Meredith.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said, \"that is why I want you. Just think a moment; don't say\nno. You are not vexed with me--are you, Syb?\"\n\n\"Vexed, Hal! I am scarcely inhuman enough to be angry on account of\nbeing loved.\"\n\nAh, why did I not love him as I have it in me to love! Why did he look\nso exasperatingly humble? I was weak, oh, so pitifully weak! I wanted a\nman who would be masterful and strong, who would help me over the rough\nspots of life--one who had done hard grinding in the mill of fate--one\nwho had suffered, who had understood. No; I could never marry Harold\nBeecham.\n\n\"Well, Syb, little chum, what do you say?\"\n\n\"Say!\"--and the words fell from me bitterly--\"I say, leave me; go and\nmarry the sort of woman you ought to marry. The sort that all men like.\nA good conventional woman, who will do the things she should at the\nproper time. Leave me alone.\"\n\nHe was painfully agitated. A look of pain crossed his face.\n\n\"Don't say that, Syb, because I was a beastly cad once: I've had all\nthat knocked out of me.\"\n\n\"I am the cad,\" I replied. \"What I said was nasty and unwomanly, and I\nwish I had left it unsaid. I am not good enough to be your wife, Hal, or\nthat of any man. Oh, Hal, I have never deceived you! There are scores of\ngood noble women in the world who would wed you for the asking--marry\none of them.\"\n\n\"But, Syb, I want you. You are the best and truest girl in the world.\"\n\n\"Och! Sure, the blarney-stone is getting a good rub now,\" I said\nplayfully.\n\nAnnoyance and amusement struggled for mastery in his expression as he\nreplied:\n\n\"You're the queerest girl in the world. One minute you snub a person,\nthe next you are the jolliest girl going, and then you get as grave and\nearnest as a fellow's mother would be.\"\n\n\"Yes, I am queer. If you had any sense, you'd have nothing to do with\nme. I'm more queer, too. I am given to something which a man never\npardons in a woman. You will draw away as though I were a snake when you\nhear.\"\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"I am given to writing stories, and literary people predict I will yet\nbe an authoress.\"\n\nHe laughed--his soft, rich laugh.\n\n\"That's just into my hand. I'd rather work all day than write the\nshortest letter; so if you will give me a hand occasionally, you can\nwrite as many yarns as you like. I'll give you a study, and send for a\ntruck-load of writing-gear at once, if you like. Is that the only horror\nyou had to tell me?\"\n\nI bowed my head.\n\n\"Well, I can have you now,\" he said gently, folding me softly in his\narms with such tender reverence that I cried out in pain, \"Oh, Hal,\ndon't, don't!\" and struggled free. I was ashamed, knowing I was not\nworthy of this.\n\nHe flushed a dusky red.\n\n\"Am I so hateful to you that you cannot bear my touch?\" he asked half\nwistfully, half angrily.\n\n\"Oh no; it isn't that. I'm really very fond of you, if you'd only\nunderstand,\" I said half to myself.\n\n\"Understand! If you care for me, that is all I want to understand. I\nlove you, and have plenty of money. There is nothing to keep us apart.\nNow that I know you care for me, I _will_ have you, in spite of the\ndevil.\"\n\n\"There will be a great tussle between you,\" I said mischievously,\nlaughing at him. \"Old Nick has a great hold on me, and I'm sure he will\ndispute your right.\"\n\nAt any time Harold's sense of humour was not at all in accordance with\nhis size, and he failed to see how my remark applied now.\n\nHe gripped my hands in a passion of pleading, as two years previously he\nhad seized me in jealous rage. He drew me to him. His eyes were dark and\nfull of entreaty; his voice was husky.\n\n\"Syb, poor little Syb, I will be good to you! You can have what you\nlike. You don't know what you mean when you say no.\"\n\nNo; I would not yield. He offered me everything--but control. He was a\nman who meant all he said. His were no idle promises on the spur of the\nmoment. But no, no, no, no, he was not for me. My love must know, must\nhave suffered, must understand.\n\n\"Syb, you do not answer. May I call you mine? You must, you must, you\nmust!\"\n\nHis hot breath was upon my cheek. The pleasant, open, manly countenance\nwas very near-perilously near. The intoxication of his love was\noverpowering me. I had no hesitation about trusting him. He was not\ndistasteful to me in any way. What was the good of waiting for that\nother--the man who had suffered, who knew, who understood? I might never\nfind him; and, if I did, ninety-nine chances to one he would not care\nfor me.\n\n\"Syb, Syb, can't you love me just a little?\"\n\nThere was a winning charm in his manner. Nature had endowed him\nliberally with virile fascination. My hard uncongenial life had rendered\nme weak. He was drawing me to him; he was irresistible. Yes; I would be\nhis wife. I grew dizzy, and turned my head sharply backwards and took a\nlong gasping breath, another and another, of that fresh cool air\nsuggestive of the grand old sea and creak of cordage and bustle and\nstrife of life. My old spirit revived, and my momentary weakness fled.\nThere was another to think of than myself, and that was Harold. Under a\nmaster-hand I would be harmless; but to this man I would be as a\ntwo-edged sword in the hand of a novice--gashing his fingers at every\nturn, and eventually stabbing his honest heart.\n\nIt was impossible to make him see my refusal was for his good. He was as\na favourite child pleading for a dangerous toy. I desired to gratify\nhim, but the awful responsibility of the after-effects loomed up and\ndeterred me.\n\n\"Hal, it can never be.\"\n\nHe dropped my hands and drew himself up.\n\n\"I will not take your No till the morning. Why do you refuse me? Is it\nmy temper? You need not be afraid of that. I don't think I'd hurt you;\nand I don't drink, or smoke, or swear very much; and I've never\ndestroyed a woman's name. I would not stoop to press you against your\nwill if you were like the ordinary run of women; but you are such a\nqueer little party, that I'm afraid you might be boggling at some funny\nlittle point that could easily be wiped out.\"\n\n\"Yes; it is only a little point. But if you wipe it out you will knock\nthe end out of the whole thing--for the point is myself. I would not\nsuit you. It would not be wise for you to marry me.\"\n\n\"But I'm the only person concerned. If you are not afraid for yourself,\nI am quite satisfied.\"\n\nWe faced about and walked homewards in unbroken silence--too perturbed\nto fall into our usual custom of chewing bush-leaves as we went.\n\n\n\nI thought much that night when all the house was abed. It was tempting.\nHarold would be good to me, and would lift me from this life of poverty\nwhich I hated, to one of ease. Should I elect to remain where I was,\ntill the grave there was nothing before me but the life I was leading\nnow: my only chance of getting above it was by marriage, and Harold\nBeecham's offer was the one chance of a lifetime. Perhaps he could\nmanage me well enough. Yes; I had better marry him.\n\nAnd I believe in marriage--that is, I think it the most sensible and\nrespectable arrangement for the replenishing of a nation which has yet\nbeen suggested. But marriage is a solemn issue of life. I was as suited\nfor matrimony as any of the sex, but only with an exceptional\nhelpmeet--and Harold was not he. My latent womanliness arose and pointed\nthis out so plainly that I seized my pen and wrote:\n\n\nDEAR HAROLD,\n\nI will not get a chance of speaking to you in the morning, so write.\nNever mention marriage to me again. I have firmly made up my mind--it\nmust be No. It will always be a comfort to me in the years to come to\nknow that I was loved once, if only for a few hours. It is not that I do\nnot care for you, as I like you better than any man I have ever seen;\nbut I do not mean ever to marry. When you lost your fortune I was\nwilling to accede to your request, as I thought you wanted me; but now\nthat you are rich again you will not need me. I am not good enough to be\nyour wife, for you are a good man; and better, because you do not know\nyou are good. You may feel uncomfortable or lonely for a little while,\nbecause, when you make up your mind, you are not easily thwarted; but\nyou will find that your fancy for me will soon pass. It is only a fancy,\nHal. Take a look in the glass, and you will see reflected there the\nfigure of a stalwart man who is purely virile, possessing not the\nslightest attribute of the weaker sex, therefore your love is merely a\npassing flame. I do not impute fickleness to you, but merely point out a\nmasculine characteristic, and that you are a man, and only a man, pure\nand unadulterated. Look around, and from the numbers of good women to be\nfound on every side choose one who will make you a fitter helpmeet, a\nmore conventional comrade, than I could ever do. I thank you for the\ninestimable honour you have conferred upon me; but keep it till you find\nsome one worthy of it, and by and by you will be glad that I have set\nyou free.\n\nGood-bye, Hal!\n\n    Your sincere and affec. friend,\n      SYBYLLA PENELOPE MELVYN.\n\nThen I crept into bed beside my little sister, and though the air inside\nhad not cooled, and the room was warm, I shivered so that I clasped the\nchubby, golden-haired little sleeper in my arms that I might feel\nsomething living and real and warm.\n\n\"Oh, Rory, Rory!\" I whispered, raining upon her lonely-hearted tears.\n\"In all the world is there never a comrade strong and true to teach me\nthe meaning of this hollow, grim little tragedy--life? Will it always be\nthis ghastly aloneness? Why am I not good and pretty and simple like\nother girls? Oh, Rory, Rory, why was I ever born? I am of no use or\npleasure to any one in all the world!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THIRTY-SEVEN\n\nHe that despiseth little things, shall fall little by little\n\n\nI\n\n\nThe morning came, breakfast, next Harold's departure. I shook my head\nand slipped the note into his hand as we parted. He rode slowly down the\nroad. I sat on the step of the garden gate, buried my face in my hands,\nand reviewed the situation. I could see my life, stretching out ahead of\nme, barren and monotonous as the thirsty track along which Harold was\ndisappearing. Today it was washing, ironing tomorrow, next day baking,\nafter that scrubbing--thus on and on. We would occasionally see a\nneighbour or a tea-agent, a tramp or an Assyrian hawker. By hard\nslogging against flood, fire, drought, pests, stock diseases, and the\nsweating occasioned by importation, we could manage to keep bread in our\nmouths. By training and education I was fitted for nought but what I\nwas, or a general slavey, which was many degrees worse. I could take my\nchoice. Life was too much for me. What was the end of it, what its\nmeaning, aim, hope, or use?\n\nIn comparison to millions I knew that I had received more than a fair\nshare of the goods of life; but knowing another has leprosy makes our\ncancer none the easier to bear.\n\nMy mother's voice, sharp and cross, roused me. \"Sybylla, you lazy\nunprincipled girl, to sit scheming there while your poor old mother is\nat the wash-tub. You sit idling there, and then by and by you'll be\ngroaning about this terrible life in which there's time for nothing but\nwork.\"\n\nHow she fussed and bothered over the clothes was a marvel to me. My\nframe of mind was such that it seemed it would not signify if all our\nclothes went to the dogs, and the clothes of our neighbours, and the\nclothes of the whole world, and the world itself for the matter of that.\n\n\"Sybylla, you are a dirty careless washer. You've put Stanley's trousers\nin the boil and the colour is coming out of them, and your father's best\nwhite handkerchief should have been with the first lot, and here it is\nnow.\"\n\nPoor mother got crosser as she grew weary with the fierce heat and\narduous toil, and as I in my abstraction continued to make mistakes, but\nthe last straw was the breaking of an old cup which I accidentally\npushed off the table.\n\nI got it hot. Had I committed an act of premeditated villainy I could\nnot have received more lecturing. I deserved it--I was careless, cups\nwere scarce with us, and we could not afford more; but what I rail\nagainst is the grindingly uneventful narrowness of the life in which the\nunintentional breaking of a common cup is good for a long scolding.\n\nAh, my mother! In my life of nineteen years I can look back and see a\ntime when she was all gentleness and refinement, but the polish has been\nworn off it by years and years of scrubbing and scratching, and washing\nand patching, and poverty and husbandly neglect, and the bearing of\nburdens too heavy for delicate shoulders. Would that we were more\ncompanionable, it would make many an oasis in the desert of our lives.\nOh that I could take an all-absorbing interest in patterns and recipes,\nbargains and orthodoxy! Oh that you could understand my desire to feel\nthe rolling billows of the ocean beneath, to hear the pealing of a great\norgan through dimly lit arches, or the sob and wail of a violin in a\nbrilliant crowded hall, to be swept on by the human stream.\n\nAh, thou cruel fiend--Ambition! Desire!\n\n    \"Soul of the leaping flame,\n       Heart of the scarlet fire,\n     Spirit that hath for name\n       Only the name--Desire!\"\n\nTo hot young hearts beating passionately in strong breasts, the sweetest\nthing is motion.\n\nNo, that part of me went beyond my mother's understanding. On the other\nhand, there was a part of my mother--her brave cheerfulness, her trust\nin God, her heroic struggle to keep the home together--which went\nsoaring on beyond my understanding, leaving me a coward weakling,\ngrovelling in the dust.\n\nWould that hot dreary day never close? What advantage when it did? The\nnext and the next and many weeks of others just the same were following\nhard after.\n\nIf the souls of lives were voiced in music, there are some that none but\na great organ could express, others the clash of a full orchestra, a few\nto which nought but the refined and exquisite sadness of a violin could\ndo justice. Many might be likened unto common pianos, jangling and out\nof tune, and some to the feeble piping of a penny whistle, and mine\ncould be told with a couple of nails in a rusty tin-pot.\n\n\n\nWhy do I write? For what does any one write? Shall I get a hearing? If\nso--what then?\n\nI have voiced the things around me, the small-minded thoughts, the\nsodden round of grinding tasks--a monotonous, purposeless, needless\nexistence. But patience, O heart, surely I can make a purpose! For the\npresent, of my family I am the most suited to wait about common\npublic-houses to look after my father when he is inebriated. It breaks\nmy mother's heart to do it; it is dangerous for my brothers; imagine\nGertie in such a position! But me it does not injure, I have the faculty\nfor doing that sort of thing without coming to harm, and if it makes me\nmore bitter and godless, well, what matter?\n\n\n\nII\n\n\nThe next letter I received from Gertie contained:\n\n\nI suppose you were glad to see Harry. He did not tell me he was going,\nor I would have sent some things by him. I thought he would be able to\ntell me lots about you that I was dying to hear, but he never said a\nword, only that you were all well. He went travelling some weeks ago. I\nmissed him at first because he used to be so kind to me; but now I\ndon't, because Mr Creyton, whom Harry left to manage Five-Bob, comes\njust as often as Harry used to, and is lots funnier. He brings me\nsomething nice every time. Uncle Jay-Jay teases me about him.\n\n\nHappy butterfly-natured Gertie! I envied her. With Gertie's letter came\nalso one from grannie, with further mention of Harold Beecham.\n\n\nWe don't know what to make of Harold Beecham. He was always such a\nsteady fellow, and hated to go away from home even for a short time, but\nnow he has taken an idea to rush away to America, and is not coming home\ntill he has gone over the world. He is not going to see anything,\nbecause by cablegrams his aunts got he is one place today and hundreds\nof miles away tomorrow. It is some craze he has suddenly taken. I was\nasking Augusta if there was ever any lunacy in the family, and she says\nnot that she knows of. It was a very unwise act to leave full management\nto Creyton and Benson in the face of such a drought. One warning and\nmarvellous escape such as he has had ought to be enough for a man with\nany sense. I told him he'd be poor again if he didn't take care, but he\nsaid he didn't mind if all his property was blown into atoms, as it had\ndone him more harm than good, whatever he means by talking that way.\nInsanity is the only reason I can see for his conduct. I thought he had\nhis eye on Gertie, but I questioned her, and it appears he has never\nsaid anything to her. I wonder what was his motive for going to Possum\nGully that time?\n\n\nTravel was indeed an unexpected development on the part of Harold\nBeecham. He had such a marked aversion to anything of that sort, and\nnever went even to Sydney or Melbourne for more than a few days at a\nstretch, and that on business or at a time of stock shows.\n\nThere were many conjectures re the motive of his visit to Possum Gully,\nbut I held my peace.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THIRTY-EIGHT\n\nA Tale that is told and a Day that is done\n\n    \"There are others toiling and straining\n       'Neath burdens graver than mine;\n     They are weary, yet uncomplaining,--\n       I know it, yet I repine:\n     I know it, how time will ravage,\n       How time will level, and yet\n     I long with a longing savage,\n       I regret with a fierce regret.\"\n\n    A. L. GORDON.\n    'Possum Gully, 25th March, 1899\n\nChristmas, only distinguished from the fifty-two slow Sundays of the\nyear by plum-pudding, roast turkey, and a few bottles of home-made beer,\nhas been once more; New Year, ushered in with sweet-scented midsummer\nwattle and bloom of gum- and box-tree has gone; February has followed,\nMarch is doing likewise, and my life is still the same.\n\nWhat the future holds I know not, and am tonight so Weary that I do not\ncare.\n\n      \"Time rules us all. And life, indeed, is not\n    The thing we planned it out, ere hope was dead;\n      And then, we women cannot choose our lot.\"\n\nTime is thorough in his work, and as that arch-cheat, Hope, gradually\nbecomes a phantom of the past, the neck will grow inured to its yoke.\n\nTonight is one of the times when the littleness--the abject\nlittleness--of all things in life comes home to me.\n\nAfter all, what is there in vain ambition? King or slave, we all must\ndie, and when death knocks at our door, will it matter whether our life\nhas been great or small, fast or slow, so long as it has been true--true\nwith the truth that will bring rest to the soul?\n\n    \"But the toughest lives are brittle,\n       And the bravest and the best\n     Lightly fall--it matters little;\n       Now I only long for rest.\"\n\nTo weary hearts throbbing slowly in hopeless breasts the sweetest thing\nis rest.\n\nAnd my heart is weary. Oh, how it aches tonight--not with the ache of a\nyoung heart passionately crying out for battle, but with the slow dead\nache of an old heart returning vanquished and defeated!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nEnough of pessimistic snarling and grumbling! Enough! Enough! Now for a\nlilt of another theme:\n\nI am proud that I am an Australian, a daughter of the Southern Cross, a\nchild of the mighty bush. I am thankful I am a peasant, a part of the\nbone and muscle of my nation, and earn my bread by the sweat of my brow,\nas man was meant to do. I rejoice I was not born a parasite, one of the\nblood-suckers who loll on velvet and satin, crushed from the proceeds of\nhuman sweat and blood and souls.\n\nAh, my sunburnt brothers!--sons of toil and of Australia! I love and\nrespect you well, for you are brave and good and true. I have seen not\nonly those of you with youth and hope strong in your veins, but those\nwith pathetic streaks of grey in your hair, large families to support,\nand with half a century sitting upon your work-laden shoulders. I have\nseen you struggle uncomplainingly against flood, fire, disease in stock,\npests, drought, trade depression, and sickness, and yet have time to\nextend your hands and hearts in true sympathy to a brother in\nmisfortune, and spirits to laugh and joke and be cheerful.\n\nAnd for my sisters a great love and pity fills my heart. Daughters of\ntoil, who scrub and wash and mend and cook, who are dressmakers,\npaperhangers, milkmaids, gardeners, and candle-makers all in one, and\nyet have time to be cheerful and tasty in your homes, and make the best\nof the few oases to be found along the narrow dusty track of your\nexistence. Would that I were more worthy to be one of you--more a\ntypical Australian peasant--cheerful, honest, brave!\n\n\n\nI love you, I love you. Bravely you jog along with the rope of class\ndistinction drawing closer, closer, tighter, tighter around you: a few\nmore generations and you will be as enslaved as were ever the moujiks of\nRussia. I see it and know it, but I cannot help you. My ineffective life\nwill be trod out in the same round of toil--I am only one of yourselves,\nI am only an unnecessary, little, bush commoner, I am only a--woman!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe great sun is sinking in the west, grinning and winking knowingly as\nhe goes, upon the starving stock and drought-smitten wastes of land.\nNearer he draws to the gum-tree scrubby horizon, turns the clouds to\norange, scarlet, silver flame, gold! Down, down he goes. The gorgeous,\ngarish splendour of sunset pageantry flames out; the long shadows\neagerly cover all; the kookaburras laugh their merry mocking good-night;\nthe clouds fade to turquoise, green, and grey; the stars peep shyly out;\nthe soft call of the mopoke arises in the gullies!

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp:\/\/pglaf.org\/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\ninformation can be found at the Foundation's web site and official\npage at http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nEach eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's\neBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,\ncompressed (zipped), HTML and others.\n\nCorrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over\nthe old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.\nVERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving\nnew filenames and etext numbers.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\nhttp:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n\nEBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,\nare filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to\ndownload any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular\nsearch system you may utilize the following addresses and just\ndownload by the etext year.\n\nhttp:\/\/www.ibiblio.org\/gutenberg\/etext06\n\n    (Or \/etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,\n     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)\n\nEBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are\nfiled in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part\nof the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is\nidentical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single\ndigits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For\nexample an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:\n\nhttp:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\/1\/0\/2\/3\/10234\n\nor filename 24689 would be found at:\nhttp:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\/2\/4\/6\/8\/24689\n\nAn alternative method of locating eBooks:\nhttp:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\/GUTINDEX.ALL\n\n*** END: FULL LICENSE ***\n","id":600,"split":"train"}
