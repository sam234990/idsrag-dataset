{"ori_id":"6b94891a91a8eeb5618a0575d341338cf0d9a82f","title":"Anthem (novella)","context":"Anthem (novella)\n Equality 7-2521, writing by candlelight in a tunnel under the earth, tells the story of his life up to that point. He exclusively uses plural pronoun(s) (\"we\", \"our\", \"they\") to refer to himself and others. He was raised like all children in his society, away from his parents in collective homes. Later, he realized that he was born with a \"curse\", that makes him learn quickly and ask many questions. He excelled at the Science of Things and dreamed of becoming a Scholar. However, a Council of Vocations assigns all people to their Life Mandate, and he was assigned to be a Street Sweeper.\nEquality 7-2521 accepts his street sweeping assignment as penance for his \"Transgression of Preference\" in secretly desiring to be a Scholar. He works with Union 5-3992 and International 4-8818, who is Equality's only friend (which is another Transgression of Preference). He found an entrance to a tunnel in their assigned work area. Despite International's protests that any exploration unauthorized by a Council is forbidden, Equality entered the tunnel and found that it contains metal tracks. Equality realized that the tunnel is from the Unmentionable Times of the distant past. He began sneaking away from his community to use the tunnel as a laboratory for scientific experiments. He stole paper and is using it to write his journal. He is now 21 years old.\nWhile cleaning a road at the edge of the City, Equality meets Liberty 5-3000, a 17-year-old Peasant girl who works in the fields. He commits another transgression by thinking constantly of her, instead of waiting to be assigned a woman at the annual Time of Mating. She has dark eyes and golden hair, and he names her \"The Golden One\". When he speaks to her, he discovers that she also thinks of him. Later he reveals his secret name for her, and Liberty tells Equality she has named him \"The Unconquered\".\nContinuing his scientific work, Equality rediscovers electricity. In the ruins of the tunnel, he finds a glass box with wires in it, that gives off light when he passes electricity through it. He decides to take his discovery to the World Council of Scholars, thinking that such a great gift to mankind will outweigh his transgressions and lead to him being made a Scholar. However, one night he loses track of time in the underground tunnel and his absence from the Home of the Street Sweepers is noticed. He is whipped and held in the Palace of Corrective Detention. The night before the World Council of Scholars is set to meet, he easily escapes; there are no guards because no one has ever attempted escape before. The next day he presents his work to the World Council of Scholars. Horrified that he has done unauthorized research, they assail him as a \"wretch\" and a \"gutter cleaner\", saying he must be punished. They say his discovery must be destroyed, lest it disrupt the plans of the World Council and the Department of Candles. Equality seizes the box and flees into the Uncharted Forest that lies outside the City.\nIn the Uncharted Forest, Equality sees himself as damned for having left his fellow men, but he enjoys his freedom. No one will pursue him into this forbidden place. He only misses the Golden One. On his second day of living in the forest, the Golden One appears, having followed him into the forest. They live together in the forest and try to express their love for one another, but they lack the words to express love as individuals.\nThey find a house from the Unmentionable Times in the mountains, and decide to live in it. While reading books from the house's library, Equality discovers the word \"I\" and tells the Golden One about it. Having rediscovered individuality, they give themselves new names from the books: Equality becomes \"Prometheus\" and Liberty becomes \"Gaea\". Prometheus talks about the past, wondering how men could give up their individuality, and plans a future in which they will regain it.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bf*******The Project Gutenberg Etext of Anthem, by Ayn Rand*******\n#1 in our series by Ayn Rand\n\nThis is version 10z, a comparison of the original files we used\nto create versions 10 and 10a. . .which helped us correct a few\nerrors per chapter in those versions.

And we know well that there is no transgression\nblacker than to do or think alone. We have broken the laws. The\nlaws say that men may not write unless the Council of Vocations\nbid them so. May we be forgiven!\n\nBut this is not the only sin upon us. We have committed a greater\ncrime, and for this crime there is no name. What punishment\nawaits us if it be discovered we know not, for no such crime has\ncome in the memory of men and there are no laws to provide for it.\n\nIt is dark here. The flame of the candle stands still in the air.\nNothing moves in this tunnel save our [-hand-] {+hands+} on the paper. We are\nalone here under the earth. It is a fearful word, alone. The laws\nsay that none among men may be alone, ever and at any time, for\nthis is the great transgression and the root of all evil. But we\nhave broken many laws. And now there is nothing here save our one\nbody, and it is strange to see only two legs stretched on the\nground, and on the wall before us the shadow of our one head.\n\nThe walls are cracked and water runs upon them in thin threads\nwithout sound, black and glistening as blood. We stole the candle\nfrom the larder of the Home of the Street Sweepers. We shall be\nsentenced to ten years in the Palace of Corrective Detention if\nit be discovered. But this matters not. It matters only that the\nlight is precious and we should not waste it to write when we\nneed it for that work which is our crime. Nothing matters save\nthe work, our secret, our evil, our precious work. Still, we must\nalso write, for--may the [-council-] {+Council+} have mercy upon us!--we wish to\nspeak for once to no ears but our own.\n\nOur name is Equality 7-2521, as it is written on the iron\nbracelet which all men wear on [-the-] {+their+} left wrists with their names\nupon it. We are twenty-one years old. We are six feet tall, and\nthis is a burden, for there are not many men who are six feet\ntall. Ever have the Teachers and the Leaders pointed to us and\nfrowned and said: \"There is evil in your bones, Equality 7-2521,\nfor your body has grown beyond the bodies of your brothers.\" But\nwe cannot change our bones nor our body.\n\nWe were born with a curse. It has always driven us to thoughts\nwhich are forbidden. It has always given us wishes which men may\nnot wish. We know that we are evil, but there is no will in us\nand no power to resist it. This is our wonder and our secret\nfear, that we know and do not resist.\n\nWe strive to be like all our brother men, for all men must be\nalike. Over the portals of the Palace of the World Council, there\nare words cut in the marble, which we {+are required to+} repeat to\nourselves whenever we are [-tempted:\n\n\n    \"WE ARE ONE IN ALL AND ALL IN ONE.\n    THERE ARE NO MEN BUT ONLY THE GREAT _WE_,\n    ONE, INDIVISIBLE AND FOREVER.\"-] {+tempted:--\"We are one in all and all in one.\n\nThere are no men but only the great WE, One, indivisible and forever.\"--+}\n\nWe repeat this to ourselves, but it helps us not.\n\nThese words were cut long ago. There is green mould in the\ngrooves of the letters and yellow streaks [-on-] {+in+} the marble, which\ncome from more years than men could count. And these words are\nthe truth, for they are written on the Palace of the World\nCouncil, and the World Council is the body of all truth. Thus has\nit been ever since the Great Rebirth, and farther back than that\nno memory can reach.\n\nBut we must never speak of the times before the Great Rebirth,\nelse we are sentenced to three years in the Palace of Corrective\nDetention. It is only the Old Ones who whisper about it in the\nevenings, in the Home of the Useless. They whisper many strange\nthings, of the towers which rose to the sky, in those\nUnmentionable Times, and of the wagons which moved without\nhorses, and of the lights which burned without flame. But those\ntimes were evil. And those times passed away, when men saw the\nGreat Truth which is this: that all men are one and that there is\nno will save the will of all men together.\n\nAll men are good and wise. It is only we, Equality 7-2521, we\nalone who were born with a curse. For we are not like our\nbrothers. And as we look back upon our life, we see that it has\never been thus and that it has brought us step by step to our\nlast, supreme transgression, our [-crime-] {+crimes+} of crimes hidden here\nunder the ground.\n\nWe remember the Home of the Infants where we lived till we were\nfive years old, together with all the children of the City who\nhad been born in the same year. The sleeping halls there were\nwhite and clean and bare of all things save one hundred beds. We\nwere just like all our brothers then, save for the one\ntransgression: we fought with our brothers. There are few\noffenses blacker than to fight with our brothers, at any age and\nfor any cause whatsoever. The Council of the Home told us so, and\nof all the children of that year, we were locked in the cellar\nmost often.\n\nWhen we were five years old, we were sent to the Home of the\nStudents, where there are ten wards, for our ten years of\nlearning. Men must learn till they reach their fifteenth year.\nThen they go to work. In the Home of the Students we arose when\nthe big bell rang in the tower and we went to our beds when it\nrang again. Before we removed our garments, we stood in the great\nsleeping hall, and we raised our right arms, and we said all\ntogether with the three Teachers at the head:\n\n\"We are nothing. Mankind is all. By the grace of our brothers are\nwe allowed our lives. We exist through, by and for our brothers\nwho are the State. Amen.\"\n\nThen we slept. The sleeping halls were white and clean and bare\nof all things save one hundred beds.\n\nWe, Equality 7-2521, were not happy in those years in the Home of\nthe Students. It was not that the learning was too hard for us.\nIt was that the learning was too easy. This is a great sin, to be\nborn with a head which is too quick. It is not good to be\ndifferent from our brothers, but it is evil to be superior to\nthem. The Teachers told us so, and they frowned when they looked\nupon us.\n\nSo we fought against this curse. We tried to forget our lessons,\nbut we always remembered. We tried not to understand what the [-Teachers-]\n{+teachers+} taught, but we always understood it before the Teachers\nhad spoken. We looked upon Union [-5-3992,-] {+5-3992+} who were a pale boy with\nonly half a brain, and we tried to say and do as they did, that\nwe might be like them, like Union 5-3992, but somehow the\nTeachers knew that we were not. And we were lashed more often\nthan all the other children.\n\nThe Teachers were just, for they had been appointed by the\nCouncils, and the Councils are the [-voice-] {+voices+} of all justice, for\nthey are the voice of all men. And if sometimes, in the secret\ndarkness of our heart, we regret that which befell us on our\nfifteenth birthday, we know that it was through our own guilt. We\nhad broken a law, for we had not paid heed to the words of our\nTeachers. The Teachers had said to us all:\n\n\"Dare not choose in your minds the work you would like to do\nwhen you leave the Home of the Students. You shall do\n[-that which-] {+what+} the\nCouncil of [-Vocations-] {+Vocation+} shall prescribe for you. For the Council of\nVocations knows in its great wisdom where you are needed by your\nbrother men, better than you can know it in your unworthy little\nminds. And if you are not needed by your brother [-man,-] {+men,+} there is no\nreason for you to burden the earth with your bodies.\"\n\nWe knew this well, in the years of our childhood, but our curse\nbroke our will. We were guilty and we confess it here: we were\nguilty of the great Transgression of Preference. We preferred\nsome work and some lessons to the others. We did not listen well\nto the history of all the Councils elected since the Great\nRebirth. But we [-love-] {+loved+} the Science of Things. We wished to know.\nWe wished to know about all the things which [-make-] {+makes+} the earth\naround us. We asked so many questions that the Teachers forbade it.\n\nWe think that there are mysteries in the\n[-sky,-] {+sky+} and [-under-] the water and in\nthe plants which grow. But the Council of Scholars has said that\nthere are no mysteries, and the Council of Scholars knows all\nthings. And we learned much from our Teachers. We learned that\nthe earth is flat and that the sun revolves around it, which\ncauses the day and [-the-] night. We learned the names of all the winds\nwhich blow over the seas and push the sails of our great ships.\nWe learned how to bleed men to cure them of all ailments.\n\nWe [-love-] {+loved+} the Science of Things. And in the darkness, in the\nsecret hour, when we awoke in the night and there were no brothers\naround us, but only their shapes in the beds and their snores,\nwe closed our eyes, and we held our lips shut, and we\nstopped our breath, that no shudder might let our brothers see or\nhear or guess, and we thought that we wished to be sent to the\nHome of the Scholars when our time would come.\n\nAll {+of+} the great modern inventions come from the Home of the\nScholars, such as the newest one, which was found only a hundred\nyears ago, of how to make candles from wax and string; also, how\nto make glass, which is put in our windows to protect us from the\nrain. To find these things, the Scholars must study the earth and\nlearn from the rivers, from the sands, from the winds and the\nrocks. And if we went to the Home of the Scholars, we could learn\nfrom these also. We could ask questions of these, for they do not\nforbid questions.\n\nAnd questions give us no rest. We know not why our curse makes us\nseek we know not what, ever and ever. But we cannot resist it. It\nwhispers to us that there are great things on this earth of ours,\nand that we [-can know them\nif we try, and that we-] must know them. We ask, why must we know, but it has\nno answer to give us. We must know that we may know.\n\nSo we wished to be sent to the Home of the Scholars. We wished it\nso much that our hands trembled under the blankets in the night,\nand we bit our arm to stop that other pain which we could not\nendure. It was evil and we dared not face our brothers in the\nmorning. For men may wish nothing for themselves. And we were\npunished when the Council of Vocations came to give us our life\nMandates which tell those who reach their fifteenth year what\ntheir work is to be for the rest of their days.\n\nThe Council of Vocations came {+in+} on the first day of spring, and\nthey sat in the great hall. And we who were fifteen and all the\nTeachers came into the great hall. And the Council of [-vocations-] {+Vocations+}\nsat on a high dais, and they had but two words to speak to each\nof the Students. They called the Students' names, and when the [-Students-]\n{+students+} stepped before them, one after another, the Council\nsaid: \"Carpenter\" or \"Doctor\" or \"Cook\" or \"Leader.\" Then each\nStudent raised their right arm and said: \"The will of our\nbrothers be done.\"\n\nNow if the Council [-has-] said \"Carpenter\" or \"Cook,\" the Students so\nassigned go to [-work,-] {+work+} and [-they-] do not study any further. But if the\nCouncil has said \"Leader,\" then those [-Students-] {+students+} go into the Home\nof the Leaders, which is the greatest house in the City, for it\nhas three stories. And there they study for many years, {+so that\nthey may become candidates+} and be elected to the City Council and\nthe State Council and the World Council--by a free and general\nvote of all men. But we wished not to be a Leader, even though it\nis a great honor. We wished to be a Scholar.\n\nSo we awaited our turn in the great hall and then we heard the\nCouncil of Vocations call our name: \"Equality 7-2521.\" We walked\nto the dais, and our legs did not tremble, and we looked up at\nthe {+Council. There were five members of the+} Council, three of the\nmale gender and two of the female. Their hair was white and their\nfaces were cracked as the clay of a dry river bed. They were old.\nThey seemed older than the marble of the Temple of the World\nCouncil. They sat before us and they did not move. And we saw no\nbreath to stir the folds of their white togas. But we knew that\nthey were alive, for a finger of the hand of the oldest rose,\npointed to us, and fell down again. This was the only thing which\nmoved, for the lips of the oldest did not move as they said:\n\"Street Sweeper.\"\n\nWe felt the cords of our neck grow tight as our head rose higher\nto look upon the faces of the Council, and we were happy. We [-knew-] {+know+}\nwe had been guilty, but now we had a way to atone for it. We\nwould accept our Life Mandate, and we would work for our\nbrothers, gladly and willingly, and we would erase our sin\nagainst them, which they did not know, but we knew. So we were\nhappy, and proud of ourselves and of our victory over ourselves.\nWe raised our right arm and we spoke, and our voice was the\nclearest, the steadiest voice in the hall that day, and we said:\n\n\"The will of our brothers be done.\"\n\nAnd we looked straight into the eyes of the Council, but their\neyes were as cold {+as+} blue glass buttons.\n\nSo we went into the Home of the Street Sweepers. It is a grey\nhouse on a narrow street. There is a sundial in its courtyard, by\nwhich the Council of the Home can tell the hours of the day and\nwhen to ring the bell. When the bell rings, we all arise from our\nbeds.  [-They-] {+The+} sky is green and cold in our windows to the east. The\nshadow on the sundial marks off a half-hour while we dress and\neat our breakfast in the dining hall, where there are five long\ntables with twenty clay plates and twenty clay cups on each\ntable. Then we go to work in the streets of the City, with our\nbrooms and our rakes. In five hours, when the sun is high, we\nreturn to the Home and we eat our midday meal, for which\none-half hour is allowed. Then we go to work again. In five\nhours, the shadows are blue on the pavements, and the sky is blue\nwith a deep brightness which is not bright. We come back to have\nour dinner, which lasts one hour. Then the bell rings and we walk\nin a straight column to one of the City Halls, for the Social\nMeeting. Other columns of men arrive from the Homes of the\ndifferent Trades. The candles are lit, and the Councils of the\ndifferent Homes stand in a pulpit, and they speak to us of our\nduties and of our brother men. Then visiting Leaders mount the\npulpit and they read to us the speeches which were made in the\nCity Council that day, for the City Council represents all men\nand all men must know. Then we sing hymns, the Hymn of\nBrotherhood, and the Hymn of Equality, and the Hymn of the\nCollective Spirit. The sky is a soggy purple when we return to\nthe Home. Then the bell rings and we walk in a straight column to\nthe City Theatre for three hours of Social Recreation. There a\nplay is shown upon the stage, with two great choruses from the\nHome of the Actors, which speak and answer all together, in two\ngreat voices. The plays are about toil and how good it is. Then\nwe walk back to the Home [-is-] {+in+} a straight column. The sky is like a\nblack sieve pierced by silver drops that tremble, ready to burst\nthrough. The moths beat against the street lanterns. We go to our\nbeds and we sleep, till the bell rings again. The sleeping halls\nare white and clean and bare of all things save one hundred beds.\n\nThus have we lived each day of four years, until two springs ago\nwhen our crime happened. Thus must all men live until they are\nforty. At forty, they are worn out. At forty, they are sent to\nthe Home of the Useless, where the Old Ones live. The Old Ones do\nnot work, for the State takes care of them. They sit in the sun\nin summer and they sit by the fire in winter. They do not speak\noften, for they are weary. The Old Ones know that they are soon\nto die. When a miracle happens and some live to be forty-five,\nthey are the\n[-ancient ones,-] {+Ancient Ones,+} and [-the-] children stare at them when\npassing by the Home of the Useless. Such is to be our life, as\nthat of all our brothers and of the brothers who came before us.\n\nSuch would have been our life, had we not committed our crime\nwhich {+has+} changed all things for us. And it was our curse which\ndrove us to our crime. We had been a good Street Sweeper and like\nall our brother Street Sweepers, save for our cursed wish to\nknow. We looked too long at the stars at night, and at the trees\nand the earth. And when we cleaned the yard of the Home of the\nScholars, we gathered the glass vials, the pieces of metal, the\ndried bones which they had discarded. We wished to keep these\nthings and to study them, but we had no place to hide them. So we\ncarried them to the City Cesspool. And then we made the\ndiscovery.\n\nIt was on a day of the spring before last. We Street Sweepers\nwork in brigades of three, and we were with Union 5-3992, they of\nthe [-half brain,-] {+half-brain,+} and with International 4-8818. Now Union 5-3992\nare a sickly lad and sometimes they are stricken with\nconvulsions, when their mouth froths and their eyes turn white.\nBut International 4-8818 are different. They are a tall, strong\nyouth and their eyes are like fireflies, for there is laughter in\ntheir eyes. We cannot look upon International 4-8818 and not\nsmile in answer. For this they were not liked in the Home of the\nStudents, as it is not proper to smile without reason. And also\nthey were not liked because they took pieces of coal and they\ndrew pictures upon the walls, and they were pictures which made\nmen laugh. But it is only our brothers in the Home of the Artists\nwho are permitted to draw pictures, so International 4-8818 were\nsent to the Home of the Street Sweepers, like ourselves.\n\nInternational 4-8818 and we are friends. This is an evil thing to\nsay, for it is a {+great+} transgression, the great Transgression of\nPreference, to love any among men better than the others, since\nwe must love all men and all men are our friends. So\nInternational 4-8818 and we have never spoken of it. But we know.\nWe know, when we look into each other's eyes. And when we look\nthus without [-words,-] {+works,+} we both know other things also, strange\nthings for which there are no words, and these things frighten us.\n\nSo on that day of the spring before last, Union 5-3992 were stricken\nwith convulsions on the edge of the City, near the City Theatre.\nWe left them to lie in the shade of the Theatre tent and\nwe went with International 4-8818 to finish our work. We came\ntogether to the great ravine behind the Theatre. It is empty save\nfor trees and weeds. Beyond the ravine there is a plain, and\nbeyond the plain there lies the Uncharted Forest, about which men\nmust not think.\n\nWe were gathering the papers and the rags which the wind had\nblown from the Theatre, when we saw an iron bar among the weeds.\nIt was old and rusted by [-man-] {+many+} rains. We pulled with all our\nstrength, but we could not move it. So we called International [-4-8818,-]\n{+4-8818+} and together we scraped the earth around the bar. Of a\nsudden the earth fell in before us, and we saw an old iron grill\nover a black hole.\n\nInternational 4-8818 stepped back. But we pulled at the grill and\nit gave way. And then we saw iron rings as steps leading down a\nshaft into a darkness without bottom.\n\n\"We shall go down,\" we said to International 4-8818.\n\n\"It is forbidden,\" they answered.\n\nWe said: \"The Council does not know of this hole, so it cannot be\nforbidden.\"\n\nAnd they answered: \"Since the Council does not know of this\nhole, there can be no law permitting to enter it. And everything\nwhich is not permitted by law is forbidden.\"\n\nBut we said: \"We shall go, none the less.\"\n\nThey were frightened, but they stood by and watched us go.\n\nWe hung on the iron rings with our hands and {+our+} feet. We could\nsee nothing below us. And above us the hole [-open-] upon the sky grew\nsmaller and smaller, till it came to be the size of a button. But\nstill we went down. Then our foot touched the ground. We rubbed\nour eyes, for we could not see. Then our eyes became used to the\ndarkness,\n[-but-] {+and+} we could not believe what we saw.\n\nNo [-men-] {+man+} known to us could have built this place, nor the men known\nto our brothers who lived before us, and yet it was built by men.\nIt was a great tunnel. Its walls were hard and smooth to the\ntouch; it felt like stone, but it was not stone. On the ground\nthere were long thin tracks of iron, but it was not iron; it felt\nsmooth and cold as glass. We knelt, and we crawled forward, our\nhand groping along the iron line to see where it would lead. But\nthere was an unbroken night ahead. Only the iron tracks glowed\nthrough it, straight and white, calling us to follow. But we\ncould not follow, for we were losing the puddle of light behind\nus. So we turned and we crawled back, our hand on the iron line.\nAnd our heart beat in our fingertips, without reason. And then we knew.\n\nWe knew suddenly that this place was left from the Unmentionable Times.\nSo it was true, and those Times had been, and all the wonders\nof those Times. Hundreds upon hundreds of years ago men knew\nsecrets which we have lost. And we thought: \"This is a foul\nplace. They are damned who touch the things of the Unmentionable\nTimes.\" But our hand which followed the track, as we crawled,\nclung to the iron as if it would not leave it, as if the skin of\nour hand were thirsty and begging of the metal some secret fluid\nbeating in its coldness.\n\nWe returned to the earth. International 4-8818 looked upon us and\nstepped back.\n\n\"Equality 7-2521,\" they said, \"your face is white.\"\n\nBut we could not speak and we stood looking upon them.\n\nThey backed away, as if they dared not touch us. Then they\nsmiled, but it was {+a+} not a gay smile; it was lost and pleading.\nBut still we could not speak. Then they said:\n\n\"We shall report our find to the City Council and both of us\nwill be rewarded.\"\n\nAnd then we spoke. Our voice was hard and there was no mercy in\nour voice. We said:\n\n\"We shall not report our find to the City Council. We shall not\nreport it to any men.\"\n\nThey raised their hands to their ears, for never had they heard\nsuch words as these.\n\n\"International 4-8818,\" we asked, \"will you report us to the\nCouncil and see us lashed to death before your eyes?\"\n\nThey stood straight [-all-] of a sudden and they answered:\n\n\"Rather would we die.\"\n\n\"Then,\" we said, \"keep silent. This place is ours. This place\nbelongs to us, Equality 7-2521, and to\n[-no-] {+not+} other men on earth.\nAnd if ever we surrender it, we shall surrender our life with it\nalso.\"\n\nThen we saw that [-they-] {+the+} eyes of International 4-8818 were full to\nthe lids with tears {+with tears+} they dared not [-drop.\nThey-] {+drop, they+}\nwhispered, and their voice trembled, so that their words lost all\nshape:\n\n\"The will of the Council is above all things, for it is the will\nof our brothers, which is holy. But if you wish it so, we shall\nobey you. Rather shall we be evil with you than good with all our\nbrothers. May the Council have mercy upon both our hearts!\"\n\nThen we walked away together and back to the Home of the Street\nSweepers. And we walked in silence.\n\nThus did it come to pass that each night, when the stars are high\nand the Street Sweepers sit in the City Theatre, we, Equality\n7-2521, steal out and run through the darkness to our place. It\nis easy to leave the Theatre; when the candles are blown [-out-] and the\nActors come onto the stage, no eyes can see us as we crawl under\nour seat and under the cloth of the tent.  [-Later,-] {+Later+} it is easy to\nsteal through the shadows and fall in line next to International\n4-8818, as the column leaves the Theatre. It is dark in the\nstreets and there are no men about, for no men may walk through\nthe City when they have no mission to walk there. Each night, we\nrun to the ravine, and we remove the stones [-which-] we have piled upon\nthe iron grill to hide it from [-the-] men. Each night, for three hours,\nwe are under the earth, alone.\n\nWe have stolen candles from the Home of the Street Sweepers, we\nhave stolen flints and knives and paper, and we have brought them\nto this place. We have stolen glass vials and powders and acids\nfrom the Home of the Scholars. Now we sit in the tunnel for three\nhours each night and we study. We melt strange metals, and we mix\nacids, and we cut open the bodies of the animals which we find in\nthe City Cesspool. We have built an oven of the bricks we\ngathered in the streets. We burn the wood we find in the ravine.\nThe fire flickers in the oven and blue shadows dance upon the\nwalls, and there is no sound of men to disturb us.\n\nWe have stolen manuscripts. This is a great offense. Manuscripts\nare precious, for our brothers in the Home of the Clerks spend\none year to copy one single script in their clear handwriting.\nManuscripts are rare and they are kept in the Home of the\nScholars. So we sit under the earth and we read the stolen\nscripts. Two years have passed since we found this place. And in\nthese two years we have learned more than we had learned in the\nten years of the Home of the Students.\n\nWe have learned things which are not in the scripts. We have\nsolved {+the+} secrets of which the Scholars have no knowledge. We\nhave come to see how great is the unexplored, and many lifetimes\nwill not bring us to the end of our quest.  [-But we\nwish no end to our quest.-] We wish nothing, save\nto be alone and to learn, and to feel as if with each day our\nsight were growing sharper than the hawk's and clearer than rock\ncrystal.\n\nStrange are the ways of evil. We are false in the faces of our\nbrothers. We are defying the will of our Councils. We alone, of\nthe thousands who walk this earth, we alone in this hour are\ndoing a work which has no purpose save that we wish to do it. The\nevil of our crime is not for the human mind to probe. The nature\nof our punishment, if it be discovered, is not {+free+} for the human\nheart to ponder. Never, not in the memory of the Ancient Ones'\nAncients, never have men done [-that\nwhich-] {+what+} we are doing.\n\nAnd yet there is no shame in us and no regret. We say to\nourselves that we are a wretch and a traitor. But we feel no\nburden upon our spirit and no fear in our heart. And it seems to\nus that our spirit is clear as a lake troubled by no eyes save those\nof the sun. And in our [-heart--\nstrange-] {+heart--strange+} are the ways of [-evil!--in-] {+evil!--\nin+} our heart there is the first peace we have known in twenty years.\n\n\n\n\n[-PART TWO-]\n\n\n\n{+Chapter Two+}\n\nLiberty 5-3000 . . . Liberty five-three thousand . . . Liberty 5-3000 . . . .\n\nWe wish to write this name. We wish to speak it, but we dare not\nspeak it above a whisper. For men are forbidden to take notice of\nwomen, and women are forbidden to take notice of men. But we\nthink of one among women, they whose name is Liberty 5-3000, and\nwe think of no others.\n\nThe women who have been assigned to work the soil live in the\nHomes of the Peasants beyond the City. Where the City ends there\nis a great road winding off to the north, and we Street Sweepers\nmust keep this road clean to the first milepost. There is a hedge\nalong the road, and beyond the hedge lie the fields. The fields\nare black and ploughed, and they lie like a great fan before us,\nwith their furrows gathered in some hand beyond the sky,\nspreading forth from that hand, opening wide apart as they come\ntoward us, like black pleats that sparkle with thin, green\nspangles. Women work in the fields, and their white tunics in the\nwind are like the wings of sea-gulls beating over the black\nsoil.\n\nAnd there [-is-] {+it+} was that we saw Liberty 5-3000 walking along the\nfurrows. Their body was straight and thin as a blade of iron.\nTheir eyes were dark and hard and glowing, with no fear in them,\nno kindness and no guilt. Their hair was golden as the sun; their\nhair flew in the wind, shining and wild, as if it defied men to\nrestrain it. They threw seeds from their hand as if they deigned\nto fling a scornful gift, and the earth was a beggar under their\nfeet.\n\nWe stood still; for the first time [-did-] we know fear, and then pain.\nAnd we stood still that we might not spill this pain more\nprecious than pleasure.\n\nThen we heard a voice from the others call their name: \"Liberty\n5-3000,\" and they turned and walked back. Thus we learned their\nname, and we stood watching them go, till their white tunic was\nlost in the blue mist.\n\nAnd the following day, as we came to the northern road, we kept\nour eyes upon Liberty 5-3000 in the field. And each day\nthereafter we knew the illness of waiting for our hour on the\nnorthern road. And there we looked at Liberty 5-3000 each day. We\nknow not whether they looked at us also, but we think they did.\n\nThen one day they came close to the hedge, and suddenly they\nturned to us. They turned in a whirl and the movement of\ntheir body stopped, as if slashed off, as suddenly as it had started.\nThey stood still as a stone, and they looked straight upon us,\nstraight [-into-] {+in+} our eyes. There was no smile on their face, and no\nwelcome. But their face was [-taut,-] {+taught,+} and their eyes were dark.\nThen they turned as swiftly, and they walked away from us.\n\nBut the following day, when we came to the road, they smiled.\nThey smiled to us and for us. And we smiled in answer. Their head\nfell back, and their arms fell, as if their arms and their thin\nwhite neck were stricken suddenly with a great lassitude. They\nwere not looking upon us, but upon the sky. Then they glanced at\nus over their shoulder,\n[-as-] {+and+} we felt as if a hand had touched our\nbody, slipping softly from our lips to our feet.\n\nEvery morning thereafter, we greeted each other with our eyes. We\ndared not speak. It is a transgression to speak to men of other\nTrades, save in groups at the Social Meetings. But once, standing\nat the hedge, we raised our hand to our forehead and then moved\nit slowly, palm down, toward Liberty 5-3000. Had the others seen\nit, they could have guessed nothing, for it looked only as if we\nwere shading our eyes from the sun. But Liberty 5-3000 saw it and\nunderstood. They raised their hand to their forehead and moved it\nas we had. Thus, each day, we greet Liberty 5-3000, and they\nanswer, and no men can suspect.\n\nWe do not wonder at this new sin of ours. It is our second\nTransgression of Preference, for we do not think of all our\nbrothers, as we must, but only of one, and their name is Liberty\n5-3000. We do not know why we think of them. We [-do-] {+don+} not know why,\nwhen we think of them, we feel [-all-] of a sudden that the earth is good\nand that it is not a burden to live.\n\nWe do not think of them as Liberty 5-3000 any longer. We have\ngiven them a name in our thoughts. We call them the Golden One.\nBut it is a sin to give men {+other+} names which distinguish them\nfrom other men. Yet we call them the Golden [-One,-] {+one,+} for they are not\nlike the others. The Golden One are not like the others.\n\nAnd we take no heed of the law which says that men may not think\nof women, save at the Time of Mating. This is the time each\nspring when all the men older than twenty and all the women older\nthan eighteen are sent for one night to the City Palace of\nMating. And each of the men have one of the women assigned to\nthem\n[-by-] {+buy+} the Council of Eugenics. Children are born each winter,\nbut women never see their children and children never know their\nparents. Twice have we been sent to the Palace of Mating, but it\nis an ugly and shameful matter, of which we do not like to think.\n\nWe had broken so many laws, and today we have broken one more.  [-Today,-]\n{+Today+} we spoke to the Golden One.\n\nThe other women were far off in the field, when we stopped at the\nhedge by the side of the road. The Golden One were kneeling alone\nat the moat which runs through the field. And the drops of water\nfalling from their hands, as they raised the water to their lips,\nwere like sparks of fire in the sun. Then the Golden One saw us,\nand they did not move, kneeling there, looking at us, and circles\nof light played upon their white tunic, from the sun on the water\nof the moat, and one sparkling drop fell from a finger of their\nhand held as frozen in the air.\n\nThen the Golden One rose and walked to the hedge, as if they had\nheard a command in our eyes. The two other Street Sweepers of our\nbrigade were a hundred paces away down the road. And we thought\nthat International 4-8818 would not betray us, and Union 5-3992\nwould not understand. So we looked straight upon the [-Golden One,-] {+golden one,+}\nand we saw the shadows of their lashes on their white cheeks and\nthe sparks of sun on their lips. And we said:\n\n\"You are beautiful, Liberty 5-3000.\"\n\nTheir face did not move and they did not avert their eyes. Only\ntheir eyes grew wider, and there was triumph in their eyes, and\nit was not triumph over us, but over things we could not guess.\n\nThen they asked:\n\n\"What is your name?\"\n\n\"Equality 7-2521,\" we answered.\n\n\"You are not one of our brothers, Equality 7-2521, for we do not\nwish you to be.\"\n\nWe cannot say what they meant, for there are no words for their\nmeaning, but we know it without words and we knew it then.\n\n\"No,\" we answered, \"nor are you one of our sisters.\"\n\n\"If you see us among scores of women, will you look upon us?\"\n\n\"We shall look upon you, Liberty 5-3000, if we see you among all\nthe women of the earth.\"\n\nThen they asked:\n\n\"Are Street Sweepers sent to different parts of the City or do\nthey always work in the same places?\"\n\n\"They always work in the same places,\" we answered, \"and no one\nwill take this road away from us.\"\n\n\"Your eyes,\" they said, \"are not like the eyes of any among men.\"\n\nAnd suddenly, without cause for the thought which came to us, we\nfelt cold, cold to our stomach.\n\n\"How old are you?\" we asked.\n\nThey understood our thought, for they lowered their eyes for the\nfirst time.\n\n\"Seventeen,\" they whispered.\n\nAnd we sighed, as if a burden had been taken from us, for we had\nbeen thinking without reason of the Palace of Mating. And we\nthought that we would not let the Golden One be sent to the\nPalace. How to prevent it, how to bar the will of the Councils,\nwe knew not, but we knew suddenly that we would. Only we do not\nknow why such thought came to us, for these ugly matters bear no\nrelation to us and the Golden One. What relation can they bear?\n\nStill, without reason, as we stood there by the hedge, we felt\nour lips drawn tight with hatred, a sudden hatred for all our\nbrother men. And the Golden One saw it and smiled slowly, and\nthere was in their smile the first sadness we had seen in them.\nWe think that in the wisdom of women the Golden One had\nunderstood more than we can understand.\n\nThen three of the sisters in the field appeared, coming toward\nthe road, so the Golden One walked away from us. They took the\nbag of seeds, and they threw the seeds into the furrows of earth\nas they walked away. But the seeds flew wildly, for the hand of\nthe Golden One was trembling.\n\nYet as we walked back to the Home of the Street Sweepers, we felt\nthat we wanted to sing, without reason. So we were reprimanded\ntonight, in the dining hall, for without knowing it we had begun\nto sing aloud some tune we had never heard. But it is not proper\nto sing without reason, save at the Social Meetings.\n\n\"We are singing because we are happy,\" we answered the one of the\nHome Council who reprimanded us.\n\n\"Indeed you are happy,\" they answered. \"How else can men be when\nthey live for their brothers?\"\n\nAnd now, sitting here in our tunnel, we wonder about these words.\nIt is forbidden, not to be happy. For, as it has been explained\nto us, men are free and the earth belongs to them; and all things\non earth belong to all men; and the will of all men together is\ngood for all; and so all men must be happy.\n\nYet as we stand at night in the great hall, removing our garments\nfor sleep, we look upon our brothers and we wonder. The heads of\nour brothers are bowed. The eyes of our brothers are dull, and\nnever do they look one another in the eyes. The shoulders of our\nbrothers are hunched, and their muscles are drawn, as if their\nbodies were shrinking and wished to shrink out of sight. And a\nword steals into our mind, as we look upon our brothers, and that\nword is fear.\n\nThere is fear hanging in the air of the sleeping halls, and in\nthe air of the streets. Fear walks through the [-City,-] {+city,+} fear without\nname, without shape. All men feel it and none dare to speak.\n\nWe feel it also, when we are in the Home of the Street Sweepers.\nBut here, in our tunnel, we feel it no longer. The air is pure\nunder the ground. There is no odor of men. And these three hours\ngive us strength for our hours above the ground.\n\nOur body is betraying us, for the Council of the Home looks with\nsuspicion upon us. It is not good to feel [-too-] {+to+} much joy nor to be\nglad that our body lives. For we matter not and it must not\nmatter to us whether we live or die, which is to be as our\nbrothers will it. But we, Equality 7-2521, are glad to be living.\nIf this is a vice, then we wish no virtue.\n\nYet our brothers are not like us. All is not well with our\nbrothers. There are Fraternity 2-5503, a quiet boy with wise,\nkind eyes, who cry suddenly, without reason, in the midst of day\nor night, and their body shakes with sobs {+so+} they cannot explain.\nThere are Solidarity 9-6347, who are a bright youth, without fear\nin the day; but they scream in their sleep, and they scream:\n\"Help us! Help us! Help us!\" into the night, in a voice which\nchills our bones, but the Doctors cannot cure Solidarity 9-6347.\n\nAnd as we all undress at night, in the dim light of [-the-] candles, our\nbrothers are silent, for they dare not speak the thoughts of\ntheir minds. For all must agree with all, and they cannot know if\ntheir thoughts are the thoughts of all, and so they fear to\nspeak. And they are glad when {+the+} candles are blown for the\nnight. But we, Equality 7-2521, look through the window upon the\nsky, and there is peace in the sky, and cleanliness, and dignity.\nAnd beyond the City there lies the plain, and beyond the plain,\nblack upon the black sky, there lies the Uncharted Forest.\n\nWe do not wish to look upon the Uncharted Forest. We do not wish\nto think of it. But ever do our eyes return to that black patch\nupon the sky. Men never enter the Uncharted Forest, for there is\nno power to explore it and no path to lead among its ancient\ntrees which stand as guards of fearful secrets. It is whispered\nthat once or twice in a hundred years, one among the men of the\nCity escape alone and run to the Uncharted Forest, without call\nor reason. These men do not return. They perish from hunger and\nfrom the claws of the wild beasts which roam the Forest. But our\nCouncils say [-that-] this is only a legend. We have heard that there are\nmany Uncharted Forests over the land, among the Cities.\n[-And-] {+and+} it is\nwhispered that they have grown over the ruins of many cities of\nthe Unmentionable Times. The trees have swallowed the ruins, and\nthe bones under the ruins, and all the things which perished.\n\nAnd as we look upon the Uncharted Forest far in the night, we\nthink of the secrets of the Unmentionable Times. And we wonder\nhow it came to pass that these secrets were lost to the world. We\nhave heard the legends of the great fighting, in which many men\nfought on one side and only a few on the other. These few were\nthe Evil Ones and they were conquered. Then great fires raged\nover the land. And in these fires the Evil Ones were {+burned. And\nthe fire which is called the Dawn of the Great Rebirth, was the\nScript Fire where all the scripts of the Evil Ones were+} burned,\nand with them all the words of the Evil Ones. Great mountains of\nflame stood in the squares of the Cities for three months. Then\ncame the Great Rebirth.\n\nThe words of the Evil [-Ones . . .-] {+Ones...+} The words of the Unmentionable [-Times . . .-]\n{+Times...+} What are the words which we have lost?\n\nMay the Council have mercy upon us! We had no wish to write such\na question, and we knew [-no-] {+not+} what we were doing till we had\nwritten it. We shall not ask this question and we shall not\nthink it. We shall not call death upon our head.\n\nAnd [-yet . . .-] {+yet...+} And [-yet . . .-] {+yet...+}\n\nThere is some word, one single word which is not in the language\nof men, but which [-had-] {+has+} been. And this is the Unspeakable Word,\nwhich no men may speak nor hear. But sometimes, and it is rare,\nsometimes, somewhere, one among men find that word. They find it\nupon scraps of old manuscripts or cut into the fragments of\nancient stones. But when they speak it they are put to death.\nThere is no crime punished by death in this world, save this one\ncrime of speaking the Unspeakable Word.\n\nWe have seen one of such men burned alive in the square of the\nCity. And it was a sight which has stayed with us through the\nyears, and it haunts us, and follows us, and it gives us no rest.\nWe were a child then, ten years old. And we stood in the great\nsquare with all the children and all the men of the City, sent to\nbehold the burning. They brought the Transgressor out into the\nsquare and they led [-them-] {+him+} to the pyre. They had torn out the tongue\nof the Transgressor, so that they could speak no longer. The\nTransgressor were young and tall. They had hair of gold and eyes\nblue as morning. They walked to the pyre, and their step did not\nfalter. And of all the faces on that square, of all the faces\nwhich shrieked and screamed and spat curses upon them, [-their-] {+theirs+} was\nthe calmest and [-the-] happiest face.\n\nAs the chains were wound over their body at the stake, and a\nflame set to the pyre, the Transgressor looked upon the City.\nThere was a thin thread of blood running from the corner of their\nmouth, but their lips were smiling. And a monstrous thought came\nto us then, which has never left us. We had heard of Saints.\nThere are the Saints of Labor, and the Saints of the Councils,\nand the Saints of the Great Rebirth. But we had never seen a\nSaint nor what the likeness of a Saint should be. And we thought\nthen, standing in the square, that the likeness of a Saint was\nthe face we saw before us in the flames, the face of the\nTransgressor of the Unspeakable Word.\n\nAs the flames rose, a thing happened which no eyes saw but ours,\nelse we would not be living today. Perhaps it had only seemed to\nus. But it seemed to us that the eyes of the Transgressor had\nchosen us from the crowd and were looking straight upon us. There\nwas no pain in their eyes and no knowledge of the agony of their\nbody. There was only joy in them, and pride, a pride holier than\n{+it+} is fit for human pride to be. And it seemed as if these eyes\nwere trying to tell us something through the flames, to send into\nour eyes some word without sound. And it seemed as if these eyes\nwere begging us to gather that word and not to let it go from us\nand from the earth. But the flames rose and we could not guess\nthe [-word. . . .-] {+word....+}\n\nWhat--even if we have to burn for it like the Saint of the [-Pyre--what-] {+pyre\n--what+} is the Unspeakable Word?\n\n\n\n\n[-PART THREE-]\n\n\n\n{+Chapter Three+}\n\nWe, Equality 7-2521, have discovered a new power of nature. And\nwe have discovered it alone, and we [-alone-] are to know it.\n\nIt is said. Now let us be lashed for it, if we must. The Council\nof Scholars has said that we all know the things which exist and\ntherefore {+all+} the things which are not known by all do not exist.\nBut we think that the Council of Scholars is blind. The secrets\nof this earth are not for all men to see, but only for those who\nwill seek them. We know, for we have found a secret unknown to\nall our brothers.\n\nWe know not what this power is nor whence [-is-] {+it+} comes. But we know\nits nature, we have watched it and worked with it. We saw it\nfirst two years ago. One night, we were cutting open the body of\na dead frog when we [-saw-] {+say+} its leg jerking. It was dead, yet it\nmoved. Some power unknown to men was making it move. We could not\nunderstand it. Then, after many tests, we found the answer. The\nfrog had been hanging on a wire of copper; and it had been the\nmetal of our knife which had sent\n[-the-] {+a+} strange power to the copper\nthrough the brine of the frog's body. We put a piece of copper\nand a piece of zinc into a jar of brine, we touched a wire to\nthem, and there, under our fingers, was a miracle which had never\noccurred before, a new miracle and a new power.\n\nThis discovery haunted us. We followed it in preference to all\nour studies. We worked with it, we tested [-it-] in more ways than we\ncan describe, and each step was [-as-] another miracle unveiling before\nus. We came to know that we had found the greatest power on\nearth. For it defies all the laws known to men. It makes the\nneedle move and turn on the compass which we stole from the Home\nof the Scholars; but we had been taught, when still a child, that\nthe loadstone points to the north and [-that-] this is a law which nothing\ncan change; yet our new power defies all laws. We found that it\ncauses lightning, and never have men known what causes lightning.\nIn thunderstorms, we raised a tall rod of iron by the side of our\nhole, and we watched it from below. We have seen the\n[-lightning-] {+lightening+}\nstrike it again and again. And now we know that metal draws the\npower of the sky, and that metal can be made to give it forth.\n\nWe have built strange things with this discovery of ours. We used\nfor it the copper wires which we found here under the ground. We\nhave walked the length of our tunnel, with a candle lighting the\nway. We could go no farther [-that-] {+than+} half a mile, for earth and rock\nhad fallen at both ends. But we gathered all the things we found\nand we brought them to our work place. We found strange boxes\nwith bars of metal inside, with many cords and strands and coils\nof metal. We found wires that led to strange little globes of\nglass on the walls; they contained threads of metal thinner than\na spider's web.\n\nThese things help us in our work. We do not understand them, but\nwe think that the men of the Unmentionable Times had known our\npower of the sky, and these things had some relation to it. We do\nnot know, but we shall learn. We cannot stop now, even though it\nfrightens us that we are alone in our knowledge.\n\nNo single one can possess greater wisdom  [-that-] {+than+} the many Scholars\nwho are elected by all men for their wisdom. Yet we can. We do.\nWe have fought against saying it, but now it is said. We do not\ncare. We forget all men, all laws and all things save our metals\nand our wires. So much is still to be learned! So long a road\nlies before us, and what care we if we must travel it alone!\n\n\n\n\n[-PART FOUR-]\n\n\n\n{+Chapter Four+}\n\nMany days passed before we could speak to the Golden One again.\nBut then came the day when the sky turned white, as if the sun\nhad burst and spread its flame in the air, and the fields lay\nstill without breath, and the dust of the road [-was-] {+what+} white in the\nglow. So the women of the field were weary, and they tarried over\ntheir work, and they were far from the road when we came. But the\nGolden [-One-] {+one+} stood alone at the hedge, waiting. We stopped and we\nsaw that their eyes, so hard and scornful to the world, were\nlooking at us [-at-] {+as+} if they would obey any word we might speak.\n\nAnd we said:\n\n\"We have [-give-] {+given+} you a name in our thoughts, Liberty 5-3000.\"\n\n\"What is our name?\" they asked.\n\n\"The Golden One.\"\n\n\"Nor do we call you Equality 7-2521 when we think of you.\"\n\n\"What name have you given us?\"\n\nThey looked straight into our eyes and they held their head high\nand they answered:\n\n\"The Unconquered.\"\n\nFor a long time we could not speak. Then we said:\n\n\"Such thoughts [-as these-] are forbidden, Golden One.\"\n\n\"But you think such thoughts as these and you wish us to think\nthem.\"\n\nWe [-look-] {+looked+} into their {+eyes+} and we could not lie.\n\n\"Yes,\" we whispered, and they smiled, and then we said: \"Our\ndearest one, do not obey us.\"\n\nThey stepped back, and their eyes were wide and still.\n\n\"Speak [-these-] {+those+} words again,\" they whispered.\n\n\"Which words?\" we asked. But they did not answer, and we knew it.\n\n\"Our dearest one,\" we whispered.\n\nNever have men said this to women.\n\nThe head of the Golden One bowed slowly, and they stood still\nbefore us, their arms at their sides, the palms of their hands\nturned to us, as if their body were delivered in submission to\nour eyes. And we could not speak.\n\nThen they raised their head, and they spoke simply and gently, as\nif they wished us to forget some anxiety of their own.\n\n\"The day is hot,\" they said, \"and you have worked for many hours\nand you must be weary.\"\n\n\"No,\" we answered.\n\n\"It is cooler in the fields,\" they said, \"and there is water to\ndrink. Are you thirsty?\"\n\n[-\"Yes,\"-]\n\n{+\"Yes,+} we answered, \"but we cannot cross the hedge.\"\n\n\"We shall bring the water to you,\" they said.\n\nThen they knelt by the moat, they gathered water in their two\nhands, they rose and they held the water out to our lips.\n\nWe do not know if we drank that water. We only knew suddenly that\ntheir hands were empty, but we were still holding our lips to\ntheir hands, and that they knew [-it,-] {+it+} but did not move.\n\nWe raised our head and stepped back. For we did not understand\nwhat had made us do this, and we were afraid to understand it.\n\nAnd the Golden One stepped back, and stood looking upon their\nhands in wonder. Then the Golden One moved away, even though no\nothers were coming, and they\n[-moved,-] {+moved+} stepping back, as if they\ncould not turn from us, their arms bent before them, as if they\ncould not lower their hands.\n\n\n\n\n[-PART FIVE-]\n\n\n\n{+Chapter Five+}\n\nWe made it. We created it. We brought it forth from the night of\nthe ages. We alone. Our hands. Our mind. Ours alone and only.\n\nWe know not what we are saying. Our head is reeling. We look upon\nthe light which we [-have-] {+had+} made. We shall be forgiven for anything we\nsay [-tonight.-] {+tonight .+} . . .\n\nTonight, after more days and trials than we can count, we\nfinished building a strange thing, from the remains of the\nUnmentionable Times, a box of glass, devised to give forth the\npower of the sky of greater strength than we had ever achieved\nbefore. And when we put our wires to this box, when we closed the\ncurrent--the wire glowed! It came to life, it turned red, and a\ncircle of light lay on the stone before us.\n\nWe stood, and we held our head in our hands. We could not\nconceive of that which we had created. We had touched no flint,\nmade no fire. Yet here was light, light that [-come-] {+came+} from nowhere,\nlight from the heart of metal.\n\nWe blew out the candle. Darkness swallowed us. There was nothing\nleft around us, nothing save night and a thin thread of flame in\nit, as a crack in the wall of a prison. We stretched our hands to\nthe wire, and we saw our fingers in the red glow. We could not\nsee our body nor feel it, and in that moment nothing existed save\nour two hands over a wire glowing in a black abyss.\n\nThen we thought of the meaning of that which lay before us. We\ncan light our tunnel, and the City, and all the Cities of the\nworld with nothing save metal and wires. We can give our brothers\na new light, cleaner and brighter than any they have ever known.\nThe power of the sky can be made to do men's bidding. There are\nno limits to its secrets and its might, and it can be made to\ngrant us anything if we but choose to ask.\n\nThen we knew what we must do. Our discovery is too great for us\nto waste our time in sweeping [-the-] streets. We must not keep our\nsecret to ourselves, nor buried under the ground. We must bring\nit into the sight of all men. We need all our time, we need the\nwork rooms of the Home of the Scholars, we want the help of our\nbrother Scholars and their wisdom joined to ours. There is so\nmuch work ahead for all of us, for all the Scholars of the world.\n\nIn a month, the World Council of Scholars is to meet in our City.\nIt is a great Council, to which the wisest of all lands are\nelected, and it meets once a year in the different Cities of the\nearth. We shall go to this Council and we shall lay before them,\nas our gift, [-this-] {+the+} glass box with the power of the sky. We shall\nconfess everything to them. They will see, understand and\nforgive. For our gift is greater than our transgression. They\nwill explain it to the Council of Vocations, and we shall be\nassigned to the Home of the Scholars. This has never been done\nbefore, but neither has a gift such as ours ever been offered to\nmen.\n\nWe must wait. We must guard our tunnel as we had never guarded it\nbefore. For should any men save the Scholars learn of our secret,\nthey would not understand it, nor would they believe us. They would\nsee nothing, save our crime of working alone, and they would destroy\nus and our light. We care not about our body, but our light [-is . . .-] {+is...+}\n\nYes, we do care. For the first time [-do-] we {+do+} care about our body.\nFor this wire is [-as-] a part of our body, as a vein torn from us,\nglowing with our blood. Are we {+are+} proud of this thread of metal,\nor of our hands which made it, or is there a line to divide these [-two?-]\n{+two.+}\n\nWe stretch out our arms. For the first time do we know how strong\nour arms are. And a strange thought comes to us: we wonder, for\nthe first time in our life, what we look like. Men never see\ntheir own faces and never ask their brothers about it, for it is\nevil to have concern for their own faces or bodies. But tonight,\nfor a reason we cannot fathom, we wish it were possible to us to\nknow the likeness of our own person.\n\n\n\n\n[-PART SIX-]\n\n\n\n{+Chapter Six+}\n\nWe have not written for thirty days. For thirty days we have not\nbeen here, in our tunnel. We had been caught.\n\nIt happened on that night when we wrote last. We forgot, that\nnight, to watch the sand in the glass which tells us when three\nhours have passed and it is time to return to the City Theatre.\nWhen we [-remembered\nit,-] {+remembered,+} the sand had run out.\n\nWe hastened to the Theatre. But the big tent stood grey and\nsilent against the sky. The streets of the City lay before us,\ndark and empty. If we went back to hide in our tunnel, we would\nbe found and our light\n[-found-] with us. So we walked to the Home of the\nStreet Sweepers.\n\nWhen the Council of the Home questioned us, we looked upon the\nfaces of the Council, but there was no curiosity in those faces,\nand no anger, and no mercy. So when the oldest of them asked us:\n\"Where have you been?\" we thought of our glass box and of our\nlight, and we forgot all else. And we answered:\n\n\"We will not tell you.\"\n\nThe oldest did not question us further. They turned to the two\nyoungest, and said, and their voice was bored:\n\n\"Take our brother Equality 7-2521 to the Palace of Corrective\nDetention. Lash them until they tell.\"\n\nSo we were taken to the Stone Room under the Palace of Corrective\nDetention. This room has no windows and it is empty save for an\niron post. Two men stood by the post, naked but for leather\naprons and leather hoods over their faces. Those who had brought\nus departed, leaving us to the two Judges who stood in a corner\nof the room. The [-Judges-] {+judges+} were small, thin men, grey and bent.\nThey gave the signal to the two strong hooded ones.\n\nThey tore [-the-] {+our+} clothes from our body, they threw us down upon our\nknees and they tied our hands to the iron post.\n\nThe first blow of the lash felt as if our spine had been cut in\ntwo. The second blow stopped the first, and for a second we felt\nnothing, then [-the-] pain struck us in our throat and fire ran in our\nlungs without air. But we did not cry out.\n\nThe lash whistled like a singing wind. We tried to count the\nblows, but we lost count. We knew that the blows were falling\nupon our [-back.-] {+back+} Only we felt nothing upon our back any longer. A\nflaming grill kept dancing before our eyes, and we thought of\nnothing save that grill, a grill, a grill of red squares, and\nthen we knew that we were looking at the squares of the iron\ngrill in the door, and there were also the squares of stone on\nthe walls, and the squares which the lash was cutting upon our\nback, crossing and re-crossing itself in our flesh.\n\nThen we saw a fist before us. It knocked our chin up, and we saw\nthe red froth of our mouth on the withered fingers, and the Judge\nasked:\n\n\"Where have you been?\"\n\nBut we jerked our head away, hid our face upon our tied hands,\nand bit our lips.\n\nThe lash whistled again. We wondered who was sprinkling burning\ncoal dust upon the floor, for we saw drops of red twinkling on\nthe stones around us.\n\nThen we knew nothing, save two voices snarling steadily, one\nafter the other, even though we knew they were speaking many\nminutes apart:\n\n\"Where have you been where have you been where have you been\nwhere have you been? . . .\"\n\nAnd our lips moved, but the sound trickled back into our throat,\nand the sound was only:\n\n\"The light . . . The light . . . The light. . . .\"\n\nThen we knew nothing.\n\nWe opened our eyes, lying on our stomach on the brick floor of a\ncell. We looked upon two hands [-lying-] {+flying+} far before us on the\nbricks, and we moved them, and we knew that they were our hands.\nBut we could not move our body. Then we smiled, for we thought of\nthe light and that we had not betrayed it.\n\nWe lay in our cell for many days. The door opened twice each day,\nonce for the men who brought us bread and water, and once for the Judges.\nMany Judges came to our cell, first the humblest and then the most\nhonored Judges of the City. They stood before us in their white togas,\nand they asked:\n\n\"Are you ready to speak?\"\n\nBut we shook our head, lying before them on the floor. And they departed.\n\nWe counted each day and each night as it passed. Then, tonight,\nwe knew that we must escape. For tomorrow the World Council of\nScholars is to meet in our City.\n\nIt was easy to escape from the Palace of Corrective Detention.\nThe locks are old on the doors and there are no guards about.\nThere is no reason to have guards, for men have never defied the\nCouncils so far as to escape from whatever place they were\nordered to be. Our body is healthy and strength returns to it\nspeedily. We [-lunged\nagainst the door and it gave way.  We-] stole through the dark passages, and through the\ndark streets, and down into our tunnel.\n\nWe lit the candle and we saw that our place had not been found\nand nothing had been touched. And our glass box stood before us\non the cold oven, as we had left it. What matter they now, the\nscars upon our back!\n\nTomorrow, in the full light of day, we shall take our box, and\nleave our tunnel open, and walk through the streets to the Home\nof the Scholars. We shall put before them the greatest gift ever\noffered to men. We shall tell them the truth. We shall hand to\nthem, as our confession, these pages we have written. We shall\njoin our hands to theirs, and we shall work together, with the\npower of the sky, for the glory of mankind. Our blessing upon\nyou, [-or-] {+our+} brothers! Tomorrow, you will take us back into your\nfold and we shall be an outcast no longer. Tomorrow we shall be\none of you again. Tomorrow . . .\n\n\n\n\n[-PART SEVEN-]\n\n\n\n{+Chapter Seven+}\n\nIt is dark here in the forest. The leaves rustle over our head,\nblack against the last gold of the sky. The moss is soft and\nwarm. We shall sleep on this moss for many nights, till the\nbeasts of the forest come to tear our body. We have no bed now,\nsave the moss, and no future, save the beasts.\n\nWe are old now, yet we were young this morning, when we carried\nour glass box through the streets of the City to the Home of the\nScholars. No men stopped us, for there were none about [-from-] the Palace\nof Corrective Detention, and the others knew nothing. No men\nstopped us at the gate. We walked through {+the+} empty passages and\ninto the great hall where the World Council of Scholars sat in\nsolemn meeting.\n\nWe saw nothing as we entered, save the sky in the great windows,\nblue and glowing. Then we saw the Scholars who sat around a long table;\nthey were as shapeless clouds huddled at the rise of [-the-] {+a+} great sky.\nThere were {+the+} men whose famous names we knew, and others\nfrom distant lands whose names we had not heard. We saw a\ngreat painting on the wall over their heads, of the twenty\nillustrious men who had invented the candle.\n\nAll the heads of the Council turned to us as we entered. These\ngreat and wise of the earth did not know what to think of us, and\nthey looked upon us with wonder and curiosity, as if we were a\nmiracle. It is true that our tunic was torn and stained with\nbrown stains which had been blood. We raised our right arm and we\nsaid:\n\n\"Our greeting to you, our honored brothers of the World Council\nof Scholars!\"\n\nThen Collective 0-0009, the oldest and wisest of the Council,\nspoke and asked:\n\n\"Who are you, our brother? For you do not look like a Scholar.\"\n\n\"Our name is [-Equality-] {+Equity+} 7-2521,\" we answered, \"and we are a Street\nSweeper of this City.\"\n\nThen [-is-] {+it+} was [-as-] if a great wind had stricken the hall, for all the\nScholars spoke at once, and they were angry and frightened.\n\n\"A Street Sweeper! A Street Sweeper walking in upon the World\nCouncil of Scholars! It is not to be believed! It is against all\nthe rules and all the laws!\"\n\nBut we knew how to stop them.\n\n\"Our brothers!\" we said. \"We matter not, nor our transgression.\nIt is only our brother men who matter. Give no thought to us, for\nwe are nothing, but listen to our words, for we bring you a gift\nsuch as [-had-] {+has+} never been brought to men. Listen to us, for we hold\nthe future of mankind in our hands.\"\n\nThen they listened.\n\nWe placed our glass box [-upon-] {+on+} the table before them. We spoke of it,\nand of our long quest, and of our tunnel, and of our escape from\nthe Palace of Corrective Detention. Not a hand moved in that\nhall, as we spoke, nor an eye. Then we put the wires to the box,\nand they all bent forward and sat still, watching. And we stood\nstill, our eyes upon the wire. And slowly, slowly as a flush of\nblood, a red flame trembled in the wire. Then the wire glowed.\n\nBut terror struck the men of the Council. They leapt to their\nfeet, they ran from the table, and they stood pressed against the\nwall, huddled together, seeking the warmth of one another's\nbodies to give them courage.\n\nWe looked upon them and we laughed and said:\n\n\"Fear nothing, our brothers. There is a great power in these\nwires, but this power is tamed. It is yours. We give it to you.\"\n\nStill they would not move.\n\n\"We give you the power of the sky!\" we cried. \"We give you the\nkey to the earth! Take it, and let us be one of you, the humblest\namong you. Let us [-all-] work together, and harness this power, and make\nit ease the toil of men. Let us throw away our candles and our\ntorches. Let us flood our cities with light. Let us bring a new\nlight to men!\"\n\nBut they looked upon us, and suddenly we were afraid. For their\neyes were still, and small, and evil.\n\n\"Our brothers!\" we cried. \"Have you nothing to say to us?\"\n\nThen Collective 0-0009 moved forward. They moved to the table and\nthe others followed.\n\n\"Yes,\" spoke Collective 0-0009, \"we have much to say to you.\"\n\nThe sound of their [-voices-] {+voice+} brought silence to the hall and to [-be-] {+the+}\nbeat of our heart.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Collective 0-0009, \"we have much to say to a wretch\nwho have broken all the laws and who boast of their infamy! How\ndared you think that your mind held greater wisdom [-that-] {+than+} the minds\nof your brothers? And if the [-Councils-] {+Council+} had decreed that you [-should-] be a\nStreet Sweeper, how dared you think that you could be of greater\nuse to men than in sweeping the streets?\"\n\n\"How dared you, gutter cleaner,\" spoke Fraternity 9-3452, \"to\nhold yourself as one alone and with the thoughts of [-the-] one and not\nof [-the-] many?\"\n\n\"You shall be burned at the stake,\" said Democracy 4-6998.\n\n\"No, they shall be lashed,\" said Unanimity 7-3304, \"till there is\nnothing left under the lashes.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Collective 0-0009, \"we cannot decide upon this, our\nbrothers. No such crime has ever been committed, and it is not\nfor us to judge. Nor for any small Council. We shall deliver this\ncreature to the World Council itself and let their will be done.\"\n\nWe looked upon them and we pleaded:\n\n\"Our brothers! You are right. Let the will of the Council be\ndone upon our body. We do not care. But the light? What will you\ndo with the light?\"\n\nCollective 0-0009 looked upon us, and they smiled.\n\n\"So you think [-that-] you have found a new power,\" said Collective\n0-0009. \"Do {+you think+} all your brothers think that?\"\n\n\"No,\" we answered.\n\n\"What is not thought by all men cannot be true,\" said Collective\n0-0009.\n\n\"You have worked on this alone?\" asked International 1-5537.\n\n[-\"Man-]\n\n{+\"Yes,\" we answered.\n\n\"What is not done collectively cannot be good,\" said\nInternational 1-5537.\n\n\"Many+} men in the Homes of the Scholars have had strange new\nideas in the past,\" said Solidarity 8-1164, \"but when the\nmajority of their brother Scholars voted against them, they\nabandoned their ideas, as all men must.\"\n\n\"This box is useless,\" said Alliance [-6-4349.-] {+6-7349.+}\n\n\"Should it be what they claim of it,\" said Harmony 9-2642, \"then\nit would bring ruin to the Department of Candles. The [-andle-] {+Candle+} is a\ngreat boon to mankind, as approved by all men. Therefore it\ncannot be destroyed by the whim of one.\"\n\n\"This would wreck the [-Plans-] {+plans+} of the World Council,\" said\nUnanimity 2-9913, \"and without the Plans of the World Council the\nsun cannot rise. It took fifty years to secure the approval of\nall the Councils for the Candle, and to decide upon the number\nneeded, and to re-fit {+the+} Plans so as to make candles instead of\ntorches. This touched upon thousands and thousands of men working\nin scores of States. We cannot alter the Plans again [-to-] {+so+} soon.\"\n\n\"And if this should lighten the toil of men,\" said Similarity\n5-0306, \"then it is a great evil, for men have no cause to exist\nsave in toiling for other men.\"\n\nThen Collective 0-0009 rose and pointed at our box.\n\n\"This thing,\" they said, \"must be destroyed.\"\n\nAnd all the others cried as one:\n\n\"It must be destroyed!\"\n\nThen we leapt to the table.\n\nWe seized our box, we shoved them aside, and we ran to the\nwindow. We turned and we looked at them for the last time, and a\nrage, such as [-it-] is not fit for humans to know, choked our voice in\nour throat.\n\n\"You [-fools\"-] {+fools!\"+} we cried. \"You fools! You thrice-damned fools!\"\n\nWe swung our fist through the windowpane, and we leapt out in a\nringing rain of glass.\n\nWe fell, but we never let the box fall from our hands. Then we\nran. We ran blindly, and men and houses streaked past us in a\ntorrent without shape. And the road seemed not to be flat before\nus, but as if it were leaping up to meet us, and we waited for\nthe earth to rise and strike us in the face. But we ran. We knew\nnot where we were going. We knew only that we must run, run to\nthe end of the world, to the end of our days.\n\nThen we knew suddenly that we were lying on a soft earth and that\nwe had stopped. Trees taller than we had ever seen before stood\nover us in {+a+} great silence. Then we knew. We were in the\nUncharted Forest. We had not thought of coming here, but our legs\nhad carried our wisdom, and our legs had brought us to the\nUncharted Forest against our will.\n\nOur glass box lay beside us. We crawled to it, we fell upon it,\nour face in our arms, and we lay still.\n\nWe lay [-this-] {+thus+} for a long time. Then we rose, we took our [-box and-] {+box, had+}\nwalked on into the forest.\n\nIt mattered not where we went. We knew that men would not follow\nus, for they never [-enter-] {+entered+} the Uncharted Forest. We had nothing\nto fear from them. The forest disposes of its own victims. This\ngave us no fear either. Only we wished to be [-away,-] away from the City\nand [-from-] the air that touches upon the air of the City. So we walked\non, our box in our arms, our heart empty.\n\nWe are doomed. Whatever days are left to us, we shall spend them\nalone. And we have heard of the corruption to be found in\nsolitude. We have torn ourselves from the truth which is our\nbrother men, and there is no road back for us, and no redemption.\n\nWe know these things, but we do not care. We care for nothing on\nearth. We are tired.\n\nOnly the glass box in our arms is like a living heart that gives\nus strength. We have lied to ourselves. We have not built this\nbox for the good of our brothers. We built it for its own sake.\nIt is above all our brothers to us, and its truth above their\ntruth. Why wonder about this? We {+have not many days to live. We+}\nare walking to the fangs awaiting us somewhere among the great,\nsilent trees. There is not a thing behind us to regret.\n\nThen a blow of pain struck us, our first and our only. We thought\nof the Golden One. We thought of the Golden One whom we shall\nnever see again. Then the pain passed. It is best. We are one of\nthe Damned. It is best if the Golden [-One-] {+one+} forget our name and the\nbody which bore that name.\n\n\n\n\n[-PART EIGHT-]\n\n\n\n{+Chapter Eight+}\n\nIt has been a day of wonder, this, our first day in the forest.\n\nWe awoke when a ray of sunlight fell across our face. We wanted\nto leap to our feet, as we have had to leap {+to our feet+} every\nmorning of our life, but we remembered suddenly that no bell had\nrung and that there was no bell to ring anywhere. We lay on our\nback, we threw our arms out, and we looked up at the sky. The\nleaves had edges of silver that trembled and rippled like a river\nof green and fire flowing high above us.\n\nWe did not wish to move. We thought suddenly that we could lie\nthus as long as we wished, and we laughed aloud at the thought.\nWe could also rise, or run, or leap, or fall down again. We were\nthinking that these were [-thoughts-] {+things+} without sense, but before we knew [-it-]\n{+it,+} our body had risen in one leap. Our arms stretched out of\ntheir own will, and our body whirled and whirled, till it raised\na wind to rustle through the leaves of the bushes. Then our hands\nseized a branch and swung us high into a tree, with no aim save\nthe wonder of learning the strength of our body. The branch\nsnapped under us and we fell upon the moss that was soft as a\ncushion. Then our body, losing all sense, rolled over and over on\nthe moss, dry leaves in our tunic, in our hair, in our face. And\nwe heard suddenly that we were laughing, laughing aloud, laughing\nas if there were no power left in us save laughter.\n\nThen we took our glass box, and we went [-on-] into the forest. We went\non, cutting through the branches, and it was as if we were\nswimming through a sea of leaves, with the bushes as waves rising\nand falling and rising around us, and flinging their green sprays\nhigh to the treetops. The trees parted before us, calling us\nforward. The forest seemed to welcome us. We went on, without\nthought, without care, with nothing to [-feel-] {+fell+} save the song of our\nbody.\n\nWe stopped when we felt hunger. We saw birds in the tree\nbranches, and flying from under our footsteps. We picked a stone\nand we sent [-is-] {+it+} as an arrow at a bird. It fell before us. We made\na fire, we cooked the bird, and we ate it, and no meal had ever\ntasted better to us. And we thought suddenly that there was a\ngreat satisfaction to be found in the food which we need and\nobtain by our own hand. And we wished to {+be+} hungry again and\nsoon, that we might know again this strange new pride in eating.\n\nThen we walked on. And we came to a stream which lay as a streak\nof glass among the trees. It lay so still that we saw no water\nbut only a cut in the earth, in which the trees grew down,\nupturned, and the sky [-lay-] at the bottom. We knelt by the stream and\nwe bent down to drink. And then we stopped. For, upon the blue of\nthe sky below us, we saw our own face for the first time.\n\nWe sat still and we held our breath. For our face and our body\nwere beautiful. Our face was not like the faces of our brothers,\nfor we felt [-not-] {+no+} pity when [-looking-] {+we looked+} upon it. Our body was not like\nthe bodies of our brothers, for our limbs were straight and thin\nand hard and strong. And we thought that we could trust this\nbeing who looked upon us from the stream, and that we had nothing\nto fear\n[-with-] {+from+} this being.\n\nWe walked on till the sun had set. When the shadows gathered\namong the trees, we stopped in a hollow between the roots, where\nwe shall sleep tonight. And suddenly, for the first time this\nday, we remembered that we are the Damned. We remembered it, and\nwe laughed.\n\nWe are writing this on the paper we had hidden in our tunic\ntogether with the written pages we had brought for the World\nCouncil of Scholars, but never given to them. We have much to\nspeak of to ourselves, and we hope we shall find the words for it\nin the days to come. Now, we cannot speak, for we cannot\nunderstand.\n\n\n\n\n[-PART NINE-]\n\n\n\n{+Chapter Nine+}\n\nWe have not written for many days. We did not wish to speak. For\nwe needed no words to remember that which has happened to us.\n\nIt was on our second day in the forest that we heard steps behind\nus. We hid in the bushes, and we waited. The steps came closer.\nAnd then we saw the fold of a white tunic among the trees, and a\ngleam of gold.\n\nWe leapt forward, we ran to them, and we stood looking upon the\nGolden One.\n\nThey saw us, and their hands closed into fists, and the fists\npulled their arms down, as if they wished their arms to hold\nthem, while their body swayed. And they could not speak.\n\nWe dared not come too close to them. We asked, and our voice\ntrembled:\n\n\"How [-did you-] come {+you+} to be here, Golden One?\"\n\n{+But they whispered only:+}\n\n\"We have found you. . . .\"\n\n\"How [-did you-] come {+you+} to be in the forest?\" we asked.\n\nThey raised their head, and there was a great pride in their\nvoice; they answered:\n\n\"We have followed you.\"\n\nThen we could not speak, and they said:\n\n\"We heard that you had gone to the Uncharted Forest, for the\nwhole City is speaking of it. So on the night of the day when we\nheard it, we ran away from the Home of the Peasants. We found the\nmarks of your feet across the plain where no men walk. So we\nfollowed them, and we went into the forest, and we followed\nthe path where the branches were broken by your body.\"\n\nTheir white tunic was torn, and the branches had cut the skin of\ntheir arms, but they spoke as if they had never taken notice of\nit, nor of weariness, nor of fear.\n\n\"We have followed you,\" they said, \"and we shall follow you\nwherever you go. If danger threatens you, we shall face it also.\nIf it be death, we shall die with you. You are damned, and we\nwish to share your damnation.\"\n\nThey looked upon us, and their voice was low, but there was\nbitterness and triumph in their [-voice.-] {+voice:+}\n\n\"Your eyes are as a flame, but our brothers have neither hope nor\nfire. Your mouth is cut of granite, but our brothers are soft and\nhumble. Your head is high, but our brothers cringe. You walk, but\nour brothers crawl. We wish to be damned with you, rather than [-pleased-] {+be\nblessed+} with all our brothers. Do as you please with us, but do\nnot send us away from you.\"\n\nThen they knelt, and bowed their golden head before us.\n\nWe had never thought of that which we did. We bent to raise the\nGolden One to their feet, but when we touched them, it was as if\nmadness had stricken us. We seized their body and we pressed our\nlips to theirs. The Golden One breathed once, and their breath\nwas a moan, and then their arms closed around us.\n\nWe stood together for a long time. And we were frightened that we\nhad lived for twenty-one years and had never known what joy is\npossible to men.\n\nThen we said:\n\n\"Our dearest one. Fear nothing of the forest. There is no danger\nin solitude. We have no need of our brothers. Let us forget their\ngood and our evil, let us forget all things save that we are\ntogether and that there is joy [-as a bond-] between us. Give us your hand.\nLook ahead. It is our own world, Golden One, a strange, unknown\nworld, but our own.\"\n\nThen we walked on into the forest, their hand in ours.\n\nAnd that night we knew that to hold the body of [-women-] {+a woman+} in our\narms is neither ugly nor shameful, but the one ecstasy granted to\nthe race of men.\n\nWe have walked for many days. The forest has no end, and we seek\nno end. But each day added to the chain of days between us and\nthe City is like an added blessing.\n\nWe have made a bow and many arrows. We can kill more birds than\nwe need for our food; we find water and fruit in the forest. At\nnight, we choose a clearing, and we build a ring of fires around\nit. We sleep in the midst of that ring, and the beasts dare not attack us.\nWe can see their eyes, green and yellow as coals, watching us\nfrom the tree branches beyond. The fires [-smoulder-] {+smolder+} as a crown\nof jewels around us, and smoke stands still in the air, in\ncolumns made blue by the moonlight. We sleep together in the\nmidst of the ring, the arms of the Golden One around us, their\nhead upon our breast.\n\nSome day, we shall stop and build a house, when we shall have\ngone far enough. But we do not have to hasten. The days before us\nare without end, like the forest.\n\nWe cannot understand this new life which we have found, yet it\nseems so clear and so simple. When questions come to puzzle us,\nwe walk faster, then turn and forget all things as we watch the\nGolden One following. The shadows of leaves fall upon their arms,\nas they spread the branches apart, but their shoulders are in the\nsun. The skin of their arms is like a blue [-mist.-] {+mist,+} but their\nshoulders are white and glowing, as if the light fell not from\nabove, but rose from under their skin. We watch the leaf which\nhas fallen upon their shoulder, and it lies at the curve of their\nneck, and a drop of dew glistens upon it like a jewel. They\napproach us, and they stop, laughing, knowing what we think, and\nthey wait obediently, without questions, till it pleases us to\nturn and go on.\n\nWe go on and we bless the earth under our feet. But questions\ncome to us again, as we walk in silence. If that which we have\nfound is the corruption of solitude, then what can men wish for\nsave corruption? If this is the great evil of being alone, then\nwhat is good and what is evil?\n\nEverything which comes from the many is good. Everything which\ncomes from one is evil.\n[-This have-] {+Thus+} we {+have+} been taught with our first\nbreath. We have broken the law, but we have never doubted it. Yet\nnow, as we walk [-through-] the forest, we are learning to doubt.\n\nThere is no life for men, save in useful toil for the good of [-all-]\ntheir brothers. But we lived not, when we toiled for our\nbrothers, we were only weary. There is no joy for men, save the\njoy shared with all their brothers. But the only things which\ntaught us joy were the power [-we-] created in our wires, and the Golden\nOne. And both these joys belong to us alone, they come from us\nalone, they bear no relation to [-all-] our brothers, and they do not\nconcern our brothers in any way. Thus do we wonder.\n\nThere is some error, one frightful error, in the thinking of men.\nWhat is that error? We do not know, but the knowledge struggles\nwithin us, struggles to be born.\n\nToday, the Golden One stopped suddenly and said:\n\n\"We love you.\"\n\nBut {+then+} they frowned and shook their head and looked at us\nhelplessly.\n\n\"No,\" they whispered, \"that is not what we wished to say.\"\n\nThey were silent, then they spoke slowly, and their words were\nhalting, like the words of a child learning to speak for the\nfirst time:\n\n\"We are one . . . alone . . . and only . . . and we love you who\nare one . . . alone . . . and only.\"\n\nWe looked into each other's eyes and we knew that the breath of a\nmiracle had touched us, and fled, and left us groping vainly.\n\nAnd we felt torn, torn for some word we could not find.\n\n\n\n\n[-PART TEN-]\n\n\n\n{+Chapter Ten+}\n\nWe are sitting at a table and we are writing this upon paper\nmade thousands of years ago. The light is dim, and we cannot see\nthe Golden One, only one lock of gold on the pillow of an ancient\nbed. This is our home.\n\nWe came upon it today, at sunrise. For many days we [-had-] {+have+} been\ncrossing a chain of mountains. The forest rose among cliffs, and\nwhenever we walked out upon a barren stretch of rock we saw great\npeaks before us in the west, and to the north of us, and to the\nsouth, as far as our eyes could see. The peaks were red and\nbrown, with the green streaks of forests as veins upon them, with\nblue mists as veils over their heads. We had never heard of these\nmountains, nor seen them marked on any map. The Uncharted Forest\nhas protected them from the Cities and from the men of the\nCities.\n\nWe climbed paths where the wild goat dared not follow. Stones\nrolled from under our feet, and we heard them striking the rocks\nbelow, farther and farther down, and the mountains rang with each\nstroke, and long after the strokes had died. But we went on, for\nwe knew that no men would ever follow our track nor reach us\nhere.\n\nThen today, at sunrise, we saw a white flame among the trees,\nhigh on a sheer peak before us. We thought that it was a fire and\n{+we+} stopped. But the flame [-was-] {+as+} unmoving, yet blinding as liquid\nmetal. So we climbed toward it through the rocks. And there,\nbefore us, on a broad summit, with the mountains rising behind\nit, stood a house such as we had never seen, and the white fire\ncame from the sun on the glass of its windows.\n\nThe house had two stories and a strange roof flat as a floor.\nThere was more window than wall upon its walls, and the windows\nwent on straight around [-the-] corners, though how this [-kept the-] house {+kept+}\nstanding we could not guess. The walls were hard and smooth, of\nthat stone unlike stone which we had seen in our tunnel.\n\nWe both knew it without words: this house was left from\nthe Unmentionable Times. The trees had protected it from time\nand weather, and from men who have less pity than time and weather.\nWe turned to the Golden One and we asked:\n\n\"Are you afraid?\"\n\nBut they shook their head. So we walked to the door, and we threw\nit open, and we stepped together into the house of the\nUnmentionable Times.\n\nWe shall need the days and the years ahead, to look, to [-learn,-] {+learn+} and\nto understand the things of this house. Today, we could only look\nand try to believe the sight of our eyes. We pulled the heavy\ncurtains from the windows and we saw that the rooms were small,\nand we thought that not more than twelve men could have lived\nhere. We thought it strange that [-men-] {+man+} had been permitted to build\na house for only twelve.\n\nNever had we seen rooms so full of light. The sunrays danced upon\ncolors, colors, {+and+} more colors [-that-] {+than+} we thought possible, we who\nhad seen no houses save the white ones, the brown ones and the\ngrey. There were great pieces of glass on the walls, but it was\nnot glass, for when we looked upon it we saw our own bodies and\nall the things behind us, as on the face of a lake. There were\nstrange things which we had never seen and the use of which we do\nnot know. And there were globes of glass everywhere, in each\nroom, the globes with the metal cobwebs inside, such as we had\nseen in our tunnel.\n\nWe found the sleeping hall and we stood in awe upon its\nthreshold. For it was a small room and there were only two beds\nin it. We found no other beds in the house, and then we knew that\nonly two had lived here, and this passes understanding. What kind\nof world did they have, the men of the Unmentionable Times?\n\nWe found garments, and the Golden One gasped at the sight of\nthem. For they were not white tunics, nor white togas; they were\nof all colors, no two of them alike. Some crumbled to dust as we\ntouched\n[-them.  But-] {+them, but+} others were of heavier cloth, and they felt\nsoft and new in our fingers.\n\nWe found a room with walls made of shelves, which held rows of\nmanuscripts, from the floor to the ceiling. Never had we seen\nsuch a number of them, nor of such strange shape. They were not\nsoft and rolled, they had hard shells of cloth and leather; and\nthe letters on their pages were [-so-] small and so even that we\nwondered at the men who had such handwriting. We glanced through\nthe pages, and we saw that they were written in our language, but\nwe found many words which we could not understand. Tomorrow, we\nshall begin to read these scripts.\n\nWhen we had seen all the rooms of the house, we looked at the\nGolden One and we both knew the thought in our minds.\n\n\"We shall never leave this house,\" we said, \"nor let it be taken\nfrom us. This is our home and the end of our journey. This is your house,\nGolden One, and ours, and it belongs to no other men whatever\nas far as the earth may stretch. We shall not share it with others,\nas we share not our joy with them, nor our love, nor our hunger.\nSo be it to the end of our days.\"\n\n\"Your will be done,\" they said.\n\nThen we went out to gather wood for the great hearth of our home.\nWe brought water from the stream which runs among the trees under\nour windows. We killed a mountain goat, and we brought its flesh\nto be cooked in a strange copper pot we found in a place of\nwonders, which must have been the cooking room of the house.\n\nWe did this work alone, for no words of ours could take the\nGolden One away from the big glass which is not glass. They stood\nbefore it and they looked and looked upon their own body.\n\nWhen the sun sank beyond the mountains, the Golden One fell\nasleep on the floor, amidst jewels, and bottles of crystal, and\nflowers of silk. We lifted the Golden One in our arms and we\ncarried them to a bed, their head falling softly upon our\nshoulder. Then we lit a candle, and we brought paper from the\nroom of the manuscripts, and we sat by the window, for we knew\nthat we could not sleep tonight.\n\nAnd now we look upon the earth and sky. This spread of naked rock\nand peaks and moonlight is like a world ready to be born, a world\nthat waits. It seems to us it asks a sign from us, a spark, a\nfirst commandment. We cannot know what word we are to give, nor\nwhat great deed this earth expects to witness. We know it waits.\nIt seems to say it has great gifts to lay before [-us, but it wishes a greater gift for-] us. We are to\nspeak. We are to give its goal, its highest meaning to all this\nglowing space of rock and sky.\n\nWe look ahead, we beg our heart for guidance in answering this\ncall no voice has spoken, yet we have heard. We look upon our\nhands. We see the dust of centuries, the dust which hid [-the-] great\nsecrets and perhaps great evils. And yet it stirs no fear within\nour heart, but only silent reverence and pity.\n\nMay knowledge come to us! What is [-the-] {+this+} secret our heart has\nunderstood and yet will not reveal to us, although it seems to\nbeat as if it were endeavoring to tell it?\n\n\n\n\n[-PART ELEVEN-]\n\n\n\n{+Chapter Eleven+}\n\nI am. I think. I will.\n\nMy hands . . . My spirit . . . My sky . . . My forest . . .\nThis earth of [-mine.-] {+mine .+} . . .\n\nWhat must I say besides? These are the words. This is the answer.\n\nI stand here on the summit of the mountain. I lift my head\nand I spread my arms. This, my body and spirit, this is the end\nof the quest. I wished to know the meaning of things. I am the meaning.\nI wished to find a warrant for being. I need no warrant for\nbeing, and no word of sanction upon my being. I am the warrant\nand the sanction.\n\nIt is my eyes which see, and the sight of my eyes grants beauty\nto the earth. It is my ears which hear, and the hearing of my\nears gives its song to the world. It is my mind which thinks, and\nthe [-judgement-] {+judgment+} of my mind is the only searchlight that can find the\ntruth. It is my will which chooses, and the choice of my will is\nthe only edict I must respect.\n\nMany words have been granted me, and some are wise, and some are\nfalse, but only three are holy: \"I will it!\"\n\nWhatever road I take, the guiding star is within me; the guiding\nstar and the loadstone which point the way. They point\n[-on-] {+in+} but one\ndirection. They point to me.\n\nI know not if this earth on which I stand is the core of the\nuniverse or if it is but a speck of dust lost in eternity. I know\nnot and I care not. For I know what happiness is possible to me\non earth. And my happiness needs no [-nigher-] {+higher+} aim to vindicate it.\nMy happiness is not the means to any end. It is the end. It is\nits own goal. It is its own purpose.\n\nNeither am I the means to any end others may wish to accomplish.\nI am not a tool for their use. I am not a servant of their needs.\nI am not a bandage for their wounds. I am not a sacrifice on\ntheir altars.\n\nI am a man. This miracle of me is mine to own and keep, and mine\nto guard, and mine to use, and mine to kneel before!\n\nI do not surrender my treasures, nor do I share them. The fortune\nof my spirit is not to be blown into coins of brass and flung to\nthe winds as alms for the poor of the spirit. I guard my\ntreasures: my thought, my will, my freedom. And the greatest of\nthese is freedom.\n\nI owe nothing to my brothers, nor do I gather debts from them. I\nask none to live for me, nor do I live for any others. I covet no\nman's soul, nor is my soul theirs to covet.\n\nI am neither foe nor friend to my brothers, but such as each of\nthem shall deserve of me. And to earn my love, my brothers must\ndo more than to have been born. I do not grant my love without\nreason, nor to any chance passer-by who may wish to claim it. I\nhonor men with my love. But honor is a thing to be earned.\n\nI shall choose friends among men, but neither slaves nor masters.\nAnd I shall choose only such as please me, and them I shall love\nand respect, but neither command nor obey. And we shall join our\nhands when we wish, or walk alone when we so desire. For in the\ntemple of his spirit, each man is alone. Let each man keep his\ntemple untouched and undefiled. Then let him join hands with\nothers if he wishes, but only beyond his holy threshold.\n\nFor the word \"We\" must never be spoken, save by one's choice and\nas a second thought. This word must never be placed first within\nman's soul, else it becomes a monster, the root of all the evils\non earth, the root of man's torture by men, and [-of-] an unspeakable lie.\n\nThe word \"We\" is as lime poured over men, which sets and hardens\nto stone, and crushes all beneath it, and that which is white and\nthat which is black are lost equally in the grey of it. It is the\nword by which the depraved steal the virtue of the good, by which\nthe weak steal the might of the strong, by which the fools steal\nthe wisdom of the sages.\n\nWhat is my joy if all hands, even the unclean, can reach into it?\nWhat is my wisdom, if even the fools can dictate to me? What is\nmy freedom, if all creatures, even the botched and [-the-] impotent, are\nmy masters? What is my life, if I am but to bow, to [-agree-] {+agree,+} and to\nobey?\n\nBut I am done with this creed of corruption.\n\nI am done with the monster of \"We,\" the word of serfdom, of\nplunder, of misery, falsehood and shame.\n\nAnd now I see the face of god, and I raise this god over the\nearth, this god whom men have sought since men came into being,\nthis god who will grant them joy and peace and pride.\n\nThis god, this one word:\n\n\"I.\"\n\n\n\n\n[-PART TWELVE-]\n\n\n\n{+Chapter Twelve+}\n\nIt was when I read the first of the books I found in my house\nthat I saw the word \"I.\" And when I understood this word, the\nbook fell from my hands, and I wept, I who had never known tears.\nI wept in deliverance and in pity for all mankind.\n\nI understood the blessed thing which I had called my curse. I\nunderstood why the best in me had been my sins and my\ntransgressions; and why I had never felt guilt in my sins. I\nunderstood that centuries of chains and lashes will not kill the\nspirit of man nor the sense of truth within him.\n\nI read {+many+} books for many days. Then I called the Golden One,\nand I told her what I had read and what I had learned. She looked\nat me and the first words she spoke were:\n\n\"I love you.\"\n\nThen I said:\n\n\"My dearest one, it is not proper for men to be without names.\nThere was a time when each man had a name of his own to\ndistinguish him from all other men. So let us choose our names. I\nhave read of a man who lived many thousands of years ago, and of\nall the names in these books, his is the one I wish to bear. He\ntook the light of the gods and [-he-] brought it to men, and he taught\nmen to be gods. And he suffered for his deed as all bearers of\nlight must suffer. His name was Prometheus.\"\n\n\"It shall be your name,\" said the Golden One.\n\n\"And I have read of a goddess,\" I said, \"who was the mother of\nthe earth and of all the gods. Her name was Gaea. Let this be\nyour name, my Golden One, for you are to be the mother of a new\nkind of gods.\"\n\n\"It shall be my name,\" said the Golden One.\n\nNow I look ahead. My future is clear before me. The Saint of the\npyre had seen the future when he chose me as his heir, as the\nheir of all the saints and all the martyrs who came before him\nand who died for the same cause, for the same word, no matter\nwhat name they gave to their cause and their truth.\n\nI shall live here, in my own house. I shall take my food from the\nearth by the toil of my own hands. I shall learn many secrets\nfrom my books. Through the years ahead, I shall rebuild the\nachievements of the past, and open the way to carry them further,\nthe achievements which are open to me, but closed forever to my\nbrothers, for their minds are shackled to the weakest and dullest [-ones-]\namong them.\n\nI have learned that [-my-] {+the+} power of the sky was known to men long\nago; they called it Electricity. It was the power that moved\ntheir greatest inventions. It lit this house with light [-which-] {+that+} came\nfrom those globes of glass on the walls. I have found the engine\nwhich produced this light. I shall learn how to repair it and how\nto make it work again. I shall learn how to use the wires which\ncarry this power. Then I shall build a barrier of wires around my\nhome, and across the paths which lead to my home; a barrier light\nas a cobweb, more impassable [-that-] {+than+} a wall of granite; a barrier my\nbrothers will never be able to cross. For they have nothing to\nfight me with, save the brute force of their numbers. I have my\nmind.\n\nThen here, on this mountaintop, with the world below me and\nnothing above me but the sun, I shall live my own truth. Gaea is\npregnant with my child.  [-Our son\nwill be raised as a man.-] He will be taught to say \"I\" and to bear\nthe pride of it. He will be taught to walk straight [-and-] on his own\nfeet. He will be taught reverence for his own spirit.\n\nWhen I shall have read all the books and learned my new way, when\nmy home will be ready and my earth tilled, I shall steal one day,\nfor the last time, into the cursed City of my birth. I shall call\nto me my friend who has no name save International 4-8818, and\nall those like him, Fraternity 2-5503, who cries without reason,\nand Solidarity [-9-6347-] {+8-6347+} who calls for help in the night, and a few\nothers. I shall call to me all the men and the women whose spirit\nhas not been killed within them and who suffer under the yoke of\ntheir brothers. They will follow me and I shall lead them to my\nfortress. And here, in this uncharted wilderness, I and they, my\nchosen friends, my fellow-builders, shall write the first chapter\nin the new history of man.\n\nThese are the {+last+} things before me. And as I stand here at the\ndoor of glory, I look behind me for the last time. I look upon\nthe history of men, which I have learned from the books, and I\nwonder. It was a long story, and the spirit which moved it was\nthe spirit of man's freedom. But what is freedom? Freedom from\nwhat? There is nothing to take a man's freedom away from him,\nsave other men. To be free, a man must be free of his brothers.\nThat is freedom. That and nothing else.\n\nAt first, man was enslaved by the gods. But he broke their\nchains.  [-The-] {+Then+} he was enslaved by the kings. But he broke their\nchains. He was enslaved by his birth, by his kin, by his race.\nBut he broke their chains. He declared to all his brothers that a\nman has rights which neither god nor king nor other men can take\naway from him, no matter what their number, for his is the right\nof man, and there is no right on earth above this right. And he\nstood on the threshold of [-the-] freedom for which the blood of the\ncenturies behind him had been spilled.\n\nBut then he gave up all he had won, and fell lower than his\nsavage beginning.\n\nWhat brought it to pass? What disaster took their reason away\nfrom men? What whip lashed them to their knees in shame and\nsubmission? The worship of the word \"We.\"\n\nWhen men accepted that worship, the structure {+of centuries\ncollapsed about them, the structure+} whose every beam had come\nfrom the thought of some one man, each in his day down the ages,\nfrom the depth of some one spirit, such [-spirit-] as {+spirit+} existed but for\nits own sake. Those men who [-survived-] {+survived-+} those eager to obey, eager\nto live for one another, since they had nothing else to vindicate [-them--those-]\n{+them- those+} men could neither carry on, nor preserve what they\nhad received. Thus did all thought, all science, all wisdom\nperish on earth. Thus did [-men---] {+men-+} men with nothing to offer save\ntheir great [-number--\nlost-] {+numbers- lose+} the steel towers, the flying ships, the\npower wires, all the things they had not created and could never\nkeep. Perhaps, later, some men had been born with the mind and\nthe courage to recover these things which were lost; perhaps\nthese men came before the Councils of Scholars. They [-were-] answered as\nI have been [-answered---] {+answered-+} and for the same reasons.\n\nBut I still wonder how it was possible, in those graceless years\nof transition, long ago, that men did not see whither they were\ngoing, and went on, in blindness and cowardice, to their fate. I\nwonder, for it is hard for me to conceive how men who knew the word [-\"I\"-] {+\"I,\"+}\ncould give it up and not know what they {+had+} lost. But such has been\nthe story, for I have lived in the City of the damned,\nand I know what horror men permitted to be brought upon them.\n\nPerhaps, in those days, there were a few among men, a few of\nclear sight and clean soul, who refused to surrender that word.\nWhat agony must have been theirs before that which they saw\ncoming and could not stop! Perhaps they cried out in protest and\nin warning. But men paid no heed to their warning. And they, [-these-]\n{+those+} few, fought a hopeless battle, and they perished with their\nbanners smeared by their own blood. And they chose to perish, for\nthey knew. To them, I send my salute across the centuries, and my pity.\n\n[-Their-]\n\n{+Theirs+} is the banner in my hand. And I wish I had the power to\ntell them that the despair of their hearts was not to be final,\nand their night was not without hope. For the battle they lost\ncan never be lost. For that which they died to save can never\nperish. Through all the darkness, through all the shame of which\nmen are capable, the spirit of man will remain alive on this\nearth. It may sleep, but it will awaken. It may wear chains, but\nit will break through. And man will go on. Man, not men.\n\n[-Here-]\n\n{+Here,+} on this mountain, I and my sons and my chosen friends shall\nbuild our new land and our fort. And it will become as the heart\nof the earth, lost and hidden at first, but beating, beating\nlouder each day. And word of it will reach every corner of the\nearth. And the roads of the world will become as veins which will\ncarry the best of the world's blood to my threshold. And all my\nbrothers, and the Councils of my brothers, will hear of it, but\nthey will be impotent against me. And the day will come when I\nshall break [-all-] the chains of the earth, and raze the cities of the\nenslaved, and my home will become the capital of a world where\neach man will be free to exist for his own sake.\n\nFor the coming of that day [-shall-] I {+shall+} fight, I and my sons and my\nchosen friends. For the freedom of Man. For his rights. For his\nlife. For his honor.\n\nAnd here, over the portals of my fort, I shall cut in the stone\nthe word which is to be my beacon and my banner. The word which\nwill not die, should we all perish in battle. The word which can\nnever die on this earth, for it is the heart of it and the\nmeaning and the glory.\n\nThe sacred word:\n\nEGO\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of The Project Gutenberg Etext of Anthem, by Ayn Rand\n","id":461,"split":"train"}
