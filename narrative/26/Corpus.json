{"ori_id":"05d2346e34d9a4140e0d30ee311c21aab82bc850","title":"Captain Singleton","context":"Captain Singleton\n The Life, Adventures, and Pyracies, of the Famous Captain Singleton (1720) covers both land and sea in one volume, in two neatly composed halves. The first half of the novel includes a remarkable overland trek across Africa after the characters are stranded in Madagascar, and the second half is almost entirely at sea, involving piratical heists in the East Indies. Eventually, Captain Bob and his close friend William Walters return to England with their spoils via Venice, disguised as Armenians.'At the beginning of the novel, Singleton, as a young boy, is kidnapped and sold to a gypsy by a beggar-woman. He is 'raised as a ward of a parish, and sent to sea at age twelve. Soon he is captured by Turkish pirates, rescued by sailors from Portugal, and after a two-year stay in that country, sails for the East Indies. By his own account young singleton is a rogue who steals from the ship's captain and harbors the desire to kill his master. Nearly hanged for his part in an attempted mutiny, Singleton is set ashore with four companions on the coast of Madagascar. A score of other sailors from the ship join them and the ensuing narrative relates their efforts to survive on the island.' The sailors find and rebuild an abandoned boat and eventually decide to pursue a journey through Africa. 'In their encounters with African natives, the Europeans provide resourceful but brutal.'\n'During the hazardous trip Singleton becomes the leader of the group by virtue of his fearlessness and ingenuity. He is a cold pragmatist whose lack of compassion is exceeded only by his talent for survival. When they find a wounded native, Singleton makes a decision based purely on expediency.' Singleton makes the decision, after considering to let the native die, that they might find the man useful to them. 'During the arduous march through lands teeming with leopards, elephants, crocodiles, and snakes, the travelers avoid catastrophe because of their modern weaponry and their European belief in reason rather than in magic. [...] The marchers meet an English merchant who has been living with the natives and who persuades Singleton and his companions to stop awhile in order to dig for gold. Having loaded themselves down with gold and elephant tusks, the adventurers finally reach a Dutch settlement, where they divide the spoils and immediately go their separate ways.'\n'Once Singleton has spent his fortune in England, he sets out again, this time for the West Indies where, by his boastful admission, he quickly takes to piracy. [...] Singleton's abilities bring him high command, although his piratical activities encourage the growth of a callousness so pervasive that at times it leads to cruelty. He denies that his men have committed certain atrocities, but calmly admits that \"more was done than it is fit to speak of here\" (p.\u00c2\u00a0188). In this portion of the novel events pile up rapidly, and there are chases and sea battles in which Singleton proves himself an able, courageous, and imaginative leader. [...] From the Indies the scene shifts to the East African coast and Madagascar where the pirates continue to plunder and sail restlessly in search of new conquests. Defoe draws a portrait of men whose love of gold is less urgent than their need for adventure. This lust for novelty takes Singleton and his men into the Pacific as far as the Philippines, before they trace their way back to the Indian Ocean and Ceylon.'\n'Friend William, a Quaker surgeon, becomes the center of the narrative as he outwits a Ceylonese King and rescues a Dutch slave. William displays further resourcefulness by succeeding in trade negotiations with English merchants in India. He serves Singleton loyally and bravely as a kind of man Friday: he is, moreover, a Christian humanist and healer who ultimately persuades his captain that a life of piracy leads nowhere. When Singleton contemplates suicide in the throes of repentance, William convinces him that the idea of taking one's life is the \"Devil's Notion\" (p.\u00c2\u00a0332) and therefore must be ignored.'\nWhen they return to England, they make the decision to stay together for the rest of their lives. Singleton marries William's sister, a widow, 'and the story ends rapidly on a note of domestic peace.'\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of The Life, Adventures and Piracies of the\nFamous Captain Singleton, by Daniel Defoe\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

It is true that three generations or so ago, Defoe's\nworks were edited by both Sir Walter Scott and Hazlitt, and that this\nmasterly piece of realism, \"Captain Singleton,\" was reprinted a few\nyears back in \"The Camelot Classics,\" but it is safe to say that out of\nevery thousand readers of \"Robinson Crusoe\" only one or two will\nhave even heard of the \"Memoirs of a Cavalier,\" \"Colonel Jack,\" \"Moll\nFlanders,\" or \"Captain Singleton.\" It is indeed distressing to think\nthat while many scores of thousands of copies of Lord Lytton's flashy\nromance, \"Paul Clifford,\" have been devoured by the public, \"Captain\nSingleton\" has remained unread and almost forgotten. But the explanation\nis simple. Defoe's plain and homely realism soon grew to be thought\nvulgar by people who themselves aspired to be refined and genteel. The\nrapid spread of popular education, in the middle of last century, was\nresponsible for a great many aberrations of taste, and the works of the\ntwo most English of Englishmen, Defoe and Hogarth, were judged to be\nhardly fitting for polite society, as we may see from Lamb's Essay on\nHogarth, and from an early edition of Chambers's \"Cyclopaedia of English\nLiterature\" (1843), where we are told: \"Nor is it needful to show how\nelegant and reflective literature, especially, tends to moralise, to\nsoften, and to adorn the soul and life of man.\" \"Unfortunately the\ntaste or _circumstances of Defoe led him mostly into low life_, and his\ncharacters are such _as we cannot sympathise with_. The whole arcana\nof roguery and villany seems to have been open to him.... It might be\nthought that the good taste which led Defoe to write in a style of such\npure and unpretending English, instead of the inflated manner of vulgar\nwriters, _would have dictated a more careful selection of his subjects_,\nand kept him from wandering so frequently into the low and disgusting\npurlieus of vice. But this moral and tasteful discrimination seems to\nhave been wholly wanting,\" &c. The 'forties were the days when critics\nstill talked learnedly of the \"noble style,\" &c., \"the vulgar,\" of\n\"sinking\" or \"rising\" with \"the subject,\" the days when Books of Beauty\nwere in fashion, and Rembrandt's choice of beggars, wrinkled faces and\ngrey hairs, for his favourite subjects seemed a low and reprehensible\ntaste in \"high art.\" Though critics to-day still ingenuously confound an\nartist's subject with his treatment of it, and prefer scenes of life to\nbe idealised rather than realised by writers, we have advanced a little\nsince the days of the poet Montgomery, and it would be difficult now\nto find anybody writing so confidently--\"Unfortunately the taste or\ncircumstances of Defoe led him mostly into low life,\" however much the\ncritic might believe it. But let us glance at a few passages in \"Captain\nSingleton,\" which may show us why Defoe excels as a realist, and why\nhis descriptions of \"low life\" are artistically as perfect as any\ndescriptions of \"higher life\" in the works of the English novelists.\nTake the following description of kidnapping:--\n\n  \"The woman pretending to take me up in her arms and kiss me, and\n  play with me, draws the girl a good way from the house, till at\n  last she makes a fine story to the girl, and bids her go back to\n  the maid, and tell her where she was with the child; that a\n  gentlewoman had taken a fancy to the child and was kissing it, but\n  she should not be frightened, or to that purpose; for they were\n  but just there; and so while the girl went, she carried me quite\n  away.--Page 2.\n\nNow here, in a single sentence, Defoe catches for us the whole soul\nand character of the situation. It _seems_ very simple, but it sums up\nmarvellously an exact observation and knowledge of the arts of the gipsy\nchild-stealer, of her cunning flattery and brassy boldness, and we can\nsee the simple little girl running back to the house to tell the nurse\nthat a fine lady was kissing the child, and had told her to tell where\nthey were and she should not be frightened, &c.; and this picture again\ncalls up the hue and cry after the kidnappers and the fruitless hopes of\nthe parents. In a word, Defoe has condensed in the eight simple lines of\nhis little scene all that is essential to its living truth; and let the\nyoung writer note that it is ever the sign of the master to do in three\nwords, or with three strokes, what the ordinary artist does in thirty.\nDefoe's imagination is so extraordinarily comprehensive in picking out\njust those little matter-of-fact details that suggest all the other\naspects, and that emphasise the character of the scene or situation,\nthat he makes us believe in the actuality of whatever he is describing.\nSo real, so living in every detail is this apocryphal narrative, in\n\"Captain Singleton,\" of the crossing of Africa by a body of marooned\nsailors from the coast of Mozambique to the Gold Coast, that one would\nfirmly believe Defoe was committing to writing the verbal narrative of\nsome adventurer in the flesh, if it were not for certain passages--such\nas the description of the impossible desert on page 90, which proves\nthat Defoe was piecing together his description of an imaginary\njourney from the geographical records and travellers' tales of his\ncontemporaries, aided perhaps by the confused yarns of some sailor\nfriends. How substantially truthful in spirit and in detail is Defoe's\naccount of Madagascar is proved by the narrative of Robert Drury's\n\"Captivity in Madagascar,\" published in 1729. The natives themselves,\nas described intimately by Drury, who lived amongst them for many years,\nwould produce just such an effect as Defoe describes on rough sailors in\ntheir perilous position. The method by which Defoe compels us to accept\nimprobabilities, and lulls our critical sense asleep, is well shown in\nthe following passages:--\n\n  \"Thieving, lying, swearing, forswearing, joined to the most\n  abominable lewdness, was the stated practice of the ship's crew;\n  adding to it, that with the most unsufferable boasts of their own\n  courage, they were, generally speaking, the most complete cowards\n  that I ever met with.\"--Page 7.\n\n  \"All the seamen in a body came up to the rail of the quarter-deck,\n  where the captain was walking with some of his officers, and\n  appointing the boatswain to speak for them, he went up, and falling\n  on his knees to the captain, begged of him in the humblest manner\n  possible, to receive the four men on board again, offering to answer\n  for their fidelity, or to have them kept in chains, till they came\n  to Lisbon, and there to be delivered up to justice, rather than, as\n  they said, to have them left, to be murdered by savages, or devoured\n  by wild beasts. It was a great while ere the captain took any notice\n  of them, but when he did, he ordered the boatswain to be seized, and\n  threatened to bring him to the capstan for speaking for them....\n  Upon this severity, one of the seamen, bolder than the rest, but\n  still with all possible respect to the captain, besought his honour,\n  as he called him, that he would give leave to some more of them to\n  go on shore, and die with their companions, or, if possible, to\n  assist them to resist the barbarians.\"--Page 18.\n\nNow the first passage we have quoted about the cowardice, &c., of the\nPortuguese crew is not in keeping with the second passage, which shows\nthe men as \"wishing to die with their companions\"; but so actual is\nthe scene of the seamen \"in a body coming up to the rail of the\nquarter-deck,\" that we cannot but believe the thing happened so, just as\nwe believe in all the thousand little details of the imaginary narrative\nof \"Robinson Crusoe.\" This feat of the imagination Defoe strengthens\nin the most artful manner, by putting in the mouths of his characters\nvarious reflections to substantiate the narrative. For example, in the\ndescription, on page 263, of the savages who lined the perilous channel\nin a half-moon, where the European ship lay, we find the afterthoughts\nare added so naturally, that they would carry conviction to any judge or\njury:--\n\n  \"They little thought what service they had done us, and how\n  unwittingly, and by the greatest ignorance, they had made\n  themselves pilots to us, while we, having not sounded the place,\n  might have been lost before we were aware. _It is true we might\n  have sounded our new harbour, before we had ventured out; but I\n  cannot say for certain, whether we should or not; for I, for my\n  part, had not the least suspicion of what our real case was;\n  however, I say, perhaps, before we had weighed, we should have\n  looked about us a little._\"\n\nTurning to the other literary qualities that make Defoe's novels great,\nif little read, classics, how delightful are the little satiric touches\nthat add grave weight to the story. Consider the following: \"My good\ngipsy mother, for some of her worthy actions, no doubt, happened in\nprocess of time to be hanged, and as this fell out something too soon\nfor me to be perfected in the strolling trade,\" &c.(p. 3). Every other\nword here is dryly satiric, and the large free callousness and careless\nbrutality of Defoe's days with regard to the life of criminals is\nconveyed in half a sentence. And what an amount of shrewd observation is\nsummed up in this one saying: \"Upon these foundations, William said he\nwas satisfied we might trust them; for, says William, I would as soon\ntrust a man whose interest binds him to be just to me, as a man whose\nprinciple binds himself\" (p. 227). Extremely subtle is also this remark:\n\"_Why, says I, did you ever know a pirate repent?_ At this he started a\nlittle and returned, _At the gallows_ I have known _one_ repent, and\nI _hope_ thou wilt be the second.\" The character of William the Quaker\npirate is a masterpiece of shrewd humour. He is the first Quaker brought\ninto English fiction, and we know of no other Friend in latter-day\nfiction to equal him. Defoe in his inimitable manner has defined surely\nand deftly the peculiar characteristics of the sect in this portrait. On\nthree separate occasions we find William saving unfortunate natives\nor defenceless prisoners from the cruel and wicked barbarity of\nthe sailors. At page 183, for example, the reader will find a most\npenetrating analysis of the dense stupidity which so often accompanies\nman's love of bloodshed. The sketch of the second lieutenant, who was\nfor \"murdering the negroes to make them tell,\" when he could not make\nthem even understand what he wanted, is worthy of Tolstoy. We have not\nspace here to dwell upon the scores of passages of similar deep insight\nwhich make \"Captain Singleton\" a most true and vivid commentary on the\nlife of Defoe's times, but we may call special attention to the passage\non page 189 which describe the sale of the negroes to the planters; to\nthe description of the awakening of the conscience of Captain Singleton\nthrough terror at the fire-cloud (page 222); and to the extraordinarily\npicturesque conversation between William and the captive Dutchman (page\n264). Finally, if the reader wishes to taste Defoe's flavour in its\nperfection let him examine carefully those passages in the concluding\ntwenty pages of the book, wherein Captain Singleton is shown as\nawakening to the wickedness of his past life, and the admirable dry\nreasoning of William by which the Quaker prevents him from committing\nsuicide and persuades him to keep his ill-gotten wealth, \"with a\nresolution to do what right with it we are able; and who knows what\nopportunity Providence may put into our hands.... As it is without\ndoubt, our present business is to go to some place of safety, where we\nmay wait His will.\" How admirable is the passage about William's sister,\nthe widow with four children who kept a little shop in the Minories,\nand that in which the penitent ex-pirates are shown us as hesitating in\nVenice for two years before they durst venture to England for fear of\nthe gallows.\n\n\"Captain Singleton\" was published in 1720, a year after \"Robinson\nCrusoe,\" when Defoe was fifty-nine. Twenty years before had seen \"The\nTrue-Born Englishman\" and \"The Shortest Way with the Dissenters\"; and\nwe are told that from \"June 1687 to almost the very week of his death in\n1731 a stream of controversial books and pamphlets poured from his\npen commenting upon and marking every important passing event.\" The\nfecundity of Defoe as a journalist alone surpasses that of any great\njournalist we can name, William Cobbett not excepted, and we may add\nthat the style of \"Captain Singleton,\" like that of \"Robinson Crusoe,\"\nis so perfect that there is not a single ineffective passage, or indeed\na weak sentence, to be found in the book.\n\nEDWARD GARNETT.\n\n\n\n\nThe following is a list of Defoe's works: \"New Discovery of Old\nIntrigue\" (verse), 1691. \"Character of Dr. Samuel Annesley\" (verse),\n1697. \"The Pacificator\" (verse), 1700. \"True-Born Englishman\" (verse),\n1701. \"The Mock Mourners\" (verse), 1702. \"Reformation of Manners\"\n(verse), 1702. \"New Test of Church of England's Loyalty,\" 1702.\n\"Shortest Way with the Dissenters,\" 1702. \"Ode to the Athenian\nSociety,\" 1703. \"Enquiry into Acgill's General Translation,\" 1703. \"More\nReformation\" (verse), 1703. \"Hymn to the Pillory,\" 1703. \"The\nStorm\" (Tale), 1704. \"Layman's Sermon on the Late Storm,\" 1704. \"The\nConsolidator; or, Memoirs of Sundry Transactions from the World in the\nMoon,\" 1704. \"Elegy on Author of 'True-Born Englishman,'\" 1704. \"Hymn\nto Victory,\" 1704. \"Giving Alms no Charity,\" 1704. \"The Dyet of\nPoland\" (verse), 1705. \"Apparition of Mrs. Veal,\" 1706. \"Sermon on the\nFilling-up of Dr. Burgess's Meeting-house,\" 1706. \"Jure Divino\"\n(verse), 1706. \"Caledonia\" (verse), 1706. \"History of the Union of\nGreat Britain,\" 1709. \"Short Enquiry into a Late Duel,\" 1713. \"A General\nHistory of Trade,\" 1713. \"Wars of Charles III.,\" 1715. \"The Family\nInstruction\" (two eds.), 1715. \"Hymn to the Mob,\" 1715. \"Memoirs of\nthe Church of Scotland,\" 1717. \"Life and Death of Count Patkul,\" 1717.\n\"Memoirs of Duke of Shrewsbury,\" 1718. \"Memoirs of Daniel Williams,\"\n1718. \"The Life and Strange Surprising Adventures of Robinson Crusoe, of\nYork, Mariner,\" 1719. \"The Farther Adventures of Robinson Crusoe,\" 1719.\n\"The Dumb Philosopher: or, Great Britain's Wonder,\" 1719. \"The King of\nPirates\" (Capt.

The maid, whether by appointment or\notherwise, meets with a fellow, her sweetheart, as I suppose; he carries\nher into a public-house, to give her a pot and a cake; and while they\nwere toying in the house the girl plays about, with me in her hand, in\nthe garden and at the door, sometimes in sight, sometimes out of sight,\nthinking no harm.\n\nAt this juncture comes by one of those sort of people who, it seems,\nmade it their business to spirit away little children. This was a\nhellish trade in those days, and chiefly practised where they found\nlittle children very well dressed, or for bigger children, to sell them\nto the plantations.\n\nThe woman, pretending to take me up in her arms and kiss me, and play\nwith me, draws the girl a good way from the house, till at last she\nmakes a fine story to the girl, and bids her go back to the maid, and\ntell her where she was with the child; that a gentlewoman had taken\na fancy to the child, and was kissing of it, but she should not be\nfrighted, or to that purpose; for they were but just there; and so,\nwhile the girl went, she carries me quite away.\n\nFrom this time, it seems, I was disposed of to a beggar woman that\nwanted a pretty little child to set out her case; and after that, to\na gipsy, under whose government I continued till I was about six years\nold. And this woman, though I was continually dragged about with her\nfrom one part of the country to another, yet never let me want for\nanything; and I called her mother; though she told me at last she was\nnot my mother, but that she bought me for twelve shillings of another\nwoman, who told her how she came by me, and told her that my name was\nBob Singleton, not Robert, but plain Bob; for it seems they never knew\nby what name I was christened.\n\nIt is in vain to reflect here, what a terrible fright the careless hussy\nwas in that lost me; what treatment she received from my justly enraged\nfather and mother, and the horror these must be in at the thoughts of\ntheir child being thus carried away; for as I never knew anything of the\nmatter, but just what I have related, nor who my father and mother were,\nso it would make but a needless digression to talk of it here.\n\nMy good gipsy mother, for some of her worthy actions no doubt, happened\nin process of time to be hanged; and as this fell out something too soon\nfor me to be perfected in the strolling trade, the parish where I was\nleft, which for my life I can't remember, took some care of me, to be\nsure; for the first thing I can remember of myself afterwards, was, that\nI went to a parish school, and the minister of the parish used to talk\nto me to be a good boy; and that, though I was but a poor boy, if I\nminded my book, and served God, I might make a good man.\n\nI believe I was frequently removed from one town to another, perhaps as\nthe parishes disputed my supposed mother's last settlement. Whether I\nwas so shifted by passes, or otherwise, I know not; but the town where\nI last was kept, whatever its name was, must be not far off from the\nseaside; for a master of a ship who took a fancy to me, was the first\nthat brought me to a place not far from Southampton, which I afterwards\nknew to be Bussleton; and there I attended the carpenters, and such\npeople as were employed in building a ship for him; and when it was\ndone, though I was not above twelve years old, he carried me to sea with\nhim on a voyage to Newfoundland.\n\nI lived well enough, and pleased my master so well that he called me his\nown boy; and I would have called him father, but he would not allow it,\nfor he had children of his own. I went three or four voyages with him,\nand grew a great sturdy boy, when, coming home again from the banks of\nNewfoundland, we were taken by an Algerine rover, or man-of-war; which,\nif my account stands right, was about the year 1695, for you may be sure\nI kept no journal.\n\nI was not much concerned at the disaster, though I saw my master, after\nhaving been wounded by a splinter in the head during the engagement,\nvery barbarously used by the Turks; I say, I was not much concerned,\ntill, upon some unlucky thing I said, which, as I remember, was about\nabusing my master, they took me and beat me most unmercifully with a\nflat stick on the soles of my feet, so that I could neither go or stand\nfor several days together.\n\nBut my good fortune was my friend upon this occasion; for, as they were\nsailing away with our ship in tow as a prize, steering for the Straits,\nand in sight of the bay of Cadiz, the Turkish rover was attacked by two\ngreat Portuguese men-of-war, and taken and carried into Lisbon.\n\nAs I was not much concerned at my captivity, not indeed understanding\nthe consequences of it, if it had continued, so I was not suitably\nsensible of my deliverance; nor, indeed, was it so much a deliverance\nto me as it would otherwise have been, for my master, who was the only\nfriend I had in the world, died at Lisbon of his wounds; and I being\nthen almost reduced to my primitive state, viz., of starving, had this\naddition to it, that it was in a foreign country too, where I knew\nnobody and could not speak a word of their language. However, I fared\nbetter here than I had reason to expect; for when all the rest of our\nmen had their liberty to go where they would, I, that knew not whither\nto go, stayed in the ship for several days, till at length one of the\nlieutenants seeing me, inquired what that young English dog did there,\nand why they did not turn him on shore.\n\nI heard him, and partly understood what he meant, though not what he\nsaid, and began then to be in a terrible fright; for I knew not where to\nget a bit of bread; when the pilot of the ship, an old seaman, seeing me\nlook very dull, came to me, and speaking broken English to me, told me\nI must be gone. \"Whither must I go?\" said I. \"Where you will,\" said he,\n\"home to your own country, if you will.\" \"How must I go thither?\" said\nI. \"Why, have you no friend?\" said he. \"No,\" said I, \"not in the world,\nbut that dog,\" pointing to the ship's dog (who, having stolen a piece\nof meat just before, had brought it close by me, and I had taken it\nfrom him, and ate it), \"for he has been a good friend, and brought me my\ndinner.\"\n\n\"Well, well,\" says he, \"you must have your dinner. Will you go with me?\"\n\"Yes,\" says I, \"with all my heart.\" In short, the old pilot took me home\nwith him, and used me tolerably well, though I fared hard enough; and I\nlived with him about two years, during which time he was soliciting his\nbusiness, and at length got to be master or pilot under Don Garcia de\nPimentesia de Carravallas, captain of a Portuguese galleon or carrack,\nwhich was bound to Goa, in the East Indies; and immediately having\ngotten his commission, put me on board to look after his cabin, in\nwhich he had stored himself with abundance of liquors, succades, sugar,\nspices, and other things, for his accommodation in the voyage, and laid\nin afterwards a considerable quantity of European goods, fine lace and\nlinen; and also baize, woollen cloth, stuffs, &c., under the pretence of\nhis clothes.\n\nI was too young in the trade to keep any journal of this voyage, though\nmy master, who was, for a Portuguese, a pretty good artist, prompted me\nto it; but my not understanding the language was one hindrance; at least\nit served me for an excuse. However, after some time, I began to look\ninto his charts and books; and, as I could write a tolerable hand,\nunderstood some Latin, and began to have a little smattering of\nthe Portuguese tongue, so I began to get a superficial knowledge of\nnavigation, but not such as was likely to be sufficient to carry me\nthrough a life of adventure, as mine was to be. In short, I learned\nseveral material things in this voyage among the Portuguese; I learned\nparticularly to be an arrant thief and a bad sailor; and I think I may\nsay they are the best masters for teaching both these of any nation in\nthe world.\n\nWe made our way for the East Indies, by the coast of Brazil; not that it\nis in the course of sailing the way thither, but our captain, either\non his own account, or by the direction of the merchants, went thither\nfirst, where at All Saints' Bay, or, as they call it in Portugal, the\nRio de Todos los Santos, we delivered near a hundred tons of goods, and\ntook in a considerable quantity of gold, with some chests of sugar, and\nseventy or eighty great rolls of tobacco, every roll weighing at least a\nhundredweight.\n\nHere, being lodged on shore by my master's order, I had the charge\nof the captain's business, he having seen me very diligent for my own\nmaster; and in requital for his mistaken confidence, I found means to\nsecure, that is to say, to steal, about twenty moidores out of the\ngold that was shipped on board by the merchants, and this was my first\nadventure.\n\nWe had a tolerable voyage from hence to the Cape de Bona Speranza; and\nI was reputed as a mighty diligent servant to my master, and very\nfaithful. I was diligent indeed, but I was very far from honest;\nhowever, they thought me honest, which, by the way, was their very great\nmistake. Upon this very mistake the captain took a particular liking to\nme, and employed me frequently on his own occasion; and, on the other\nhand, in recompense for my officious diligence, I received several\nparticular favours from him; particularly, I was, by the captain's\ncommand, made a kind of a steward under the ship's steward, for such\nprovisions as the captain demanded for his own table. He had another\nsteward for his private stores besides, but my office concerned only\nwhat the captain called for of the ship's stores for his private use.\n\nHowever, by this means I had opportunity particularly to take care of my\nmaster's man, and to furnish myself with sufficient provisions to make\nme live much better than the other people in the ship; for the captain\nseldom ordered anything out of the ship's stores, as above, but I snipt\nsome of it for my own share. We arrived at Goa, in the East Indies, in\nabout seven months from Lisbon, and remained there eight more; during\nwhich time I had indeed nothing to do, my master being generally on\nshore, but to learn everything that is wicked among the Portuguese, a\nnation the most perfidious and the most debauched, the most insolent and\ncruel, of any that pretend to call themselves Christians, in the world.\n\nThieving, lying, swearing, forswearing, joined to the most abominable\nlewdness, was the stated practice of the ship's crew; adding to it,\nthat, with the most insufferable boasts of their own courage, they were,\ngenerally speaking, the most complete cowards that I ever met with;\nand the consequence of their cowardice was evident upon many occasions.\nHowever, there was here and there one among them that was not so bad\nas the rest; and, as my lot fell among them, it made me have the most\ncontemptible thoughts of the rest, as indeed they deserved.\n\nI was exactly fitted for their society indeed; for I had no sense of\nvirtue or religion upon me. I had never heard much of either, except\nwhat a good old parson had said to me when I was a child of about eight\nor nine years old; nay, I was preparing and growing up apace to be as\nwicked as anybody could be, or perhaps ever was. Fate certainly thus\ndirected my beginning, knowing that I had work which I had to do in the\nworld, which nothing but one hardened against all sense of honesty\nor religion could go through; and yet, even in this state of original\nwickedness, I entertained such a settled abhorrence of the abandoned\nvileness of the Portuguese, that I could not but hate them most heartily\nfrom the beginning, and all my life afterwards. They were so brutishly\nwicked, so base and perfidious, not only to strangers but to one\nanother, so meanly submissive when subjected, so insolent, or barbarous\nand tyrannical, when superior, that I thought there was something in\nthem that shocked my very nature. Add to this that it is natural to an\nEnglishman to hate a coward, it all joined together to make the devil\nand a Portuguese equally my aversion.\n\nHowever, according to the English proverb, he that is shipped with the\ndevil must sail with the devil; I was among them, and I managed myself\nas well as I could. My master had consented that I should assist the\ncaptain in the office, as above; but, as I understood afterwards that\nthe captain allowed my master half a moidore a month for my service, and\nthat he had my name upon the ship's books also, I expected that when\nthe ship came to be paid four months' wages at the Indies, as they, it\nseems, always do, my master would let me have something for myself.\n\nBut I was wrong in my man, for he was none of that kind; he had taken\nme up as in distress, and his business was to keep me so, and make his\nmarket of me as well as he could, which I began to think of after a\ndifferent manner than I did at first, for at first I thought he had\nentertained me in mere charity, upon seeing my distressed circumstances,\nbut did not doubt but when he put me on board the ship, I should have\nsome wages for my service.\n\nBut he thought, it seems, quite otherwise; and when I procured one to\nspeak to him about it, when the ship was paid at Goa, he flew into the\ngreatest rage imaginable, and called me English dog, young heretic, and\nthreatened to put me into the Inquisition. Indeed, of all the names\nthe four-and-twenty letters could make up, he should not have called me\nheretic; for as I knew nothing about religion, neither Protestant from\nPapist, or either of them from a Mahometan, I could never be a heretic.\nHowever, it passed but a little, but, as young as I was, I had been\ncarried into the Inquisition, and there, if they had asked me if I was\na Protestant or a Catholic, I should have said yes to that which came\nfirst. If it had been the Protestant they had asked first, it had\ncertainly made a martyr of me for I did not know what.\n\nBut the very priest they carried with them, or chaplain of the ship,\nas we called him, saved me; for seeing me a boy entirely ignorant of\nreligion, and ready to do or say anything they bid me, he asked me some\nquestions about it, which he found I answered so very simply, that\nhe took it upon him to tell them he would answer for my being a good\nCatholic, and he hoped he should be the means of saving my soul, and he\npleased himself that it was to be a work of merit to him; so he made me\nas good a Papist as any of them in about a week's time.\n\nI then told him my case about my master; how, it is true, he had taken\nme up in a miserable case on board a man-of-war at Lisbon; and I was\nindebted to him for bringing me on board this ship; that if I had been\nleft at Lisbon, I might have starved, and the like; and therefore I\nwas willing to serve him, but that I hoped he would give me some little\nconsideration for my service, or let me know how long he expected I\nshould serve him for nothing.\n\nIt was all one; neither the priest nor any one else could prevail with\nhim, but that I was not his servant but his slave, that he took me in\nthe Algerine, and that I was a Turk, only pretended to be an English boy\nto get my liberty, and he would carry me to the Inquisition as a Turk.\n\nThis frighted me out of my wits, for I had nobody to vouch for me what I\nwas, or from whence I came; but the good Padre Antonio, for that was his\nname, cleared me of that part by a way I did not understand; for he came\nto me one morning with two sailors, and told me they must search me, to\nbear witness that I was not a Turk. I was amazed at them, and frighted,\nand did not understand them, nor could I imagine what they intended to\ndo to me. However, stripping me, they were soon satisfied, and Father\nAntony bade me be easy, for they could all witness that I was no Turk.\nSo I escaped that part of my master's cruelty.\n\nAnd now I resolved from that time to run away from him if I could, but\nthere was no doing of it there, for there were not ships of any nation\nin the world in that port, except two or three Persian vessels from\nOrmus, so that if I had offered to go away from him, he would have had\nme seized on shore, and brought on board by force; so that I had no\nremedy but patience. And this he brought to an end too as soon as he\ncould, for after this he began to use me ill, and not only to straiten\nmy provisions, but to beat and torture me in a barbarous manner for\nevery trifle, so that, in a word, my life began to be very miserable.\n\nThe violence of this usage of me, and the impossibility of my escape\nfrom his hands, set my head a-working upon all sorts of mischief, and in\nparticular I resolved, after studying all other ways to deliver myself,\nand finding all ineffectual, I say, I resolved to murder him. With this\nhellish resolution in my head, I spent whole nights and days contriving\nhow to put it in execution, the devil prompting me very warmly to the\nfact. I was indeed entirely at a loss for the means, for I had neither\ngun or sword, nor any weapon to assault him with; poison I had my\nthoughts much upon, but knew not where to get any; or, if I might have\ngot it, I did not know the country word for it, or by what name to ask\nfor it.\n\nIn this manner I quitted the fact, intentionally, a hundred and a\nhundred times; but Providence, either for his sake or for mine, always\nfrustrated my designs, and I could never bring it to pass; so I was\nobliged to continue in his chains till the ship, having taken in her\nloading, set sail for Portugal.\n\nI can say nothing here to the manner of our voyage, for, as I said, I\nkept no journal; but this I can give an account of, that having been\nonce as high as the Cape of Good Hope, as we call it, or Cabo de Bona\nSperanza, as they call it, we were driven back again by a violent storm\nfrom the W.S.W., which held us six days and nights a great way to the\neastward, and after that, standing afore the wind for several days more,\nwe at last came to an anchor on the coast of Madagascar.\n\nThe storm had been so violent that the ship had received a great deal of\ndamage, and it required some time to repair her; so, standing in nearer\nthe shore, the pilot, my master, brought the ship into a very good\nharbour, where we rid in twenty-six fathoms water, about half a mile\nfrom the shore.\n\nWhile the ship rode here there happened a most desperate mutiny among\nthe men, upon account of some deficiency in their allowance, which came\nto that height that they threatened the captain to set him on shore, and\ngo back with the ship to Goa. I wished they would with all my heart,\nfor I was full of mischief in my head, and ready enough to do any. So,\nthough I was but a boy, as they called me, yet I prompted the mischief\nall I could, and embarked in it so openly, that I escaped very little\nbeing hanged in the first and most early part of my life; for the\ncaptain had some notice that there was a design laid by some of the\ncompany to murder him; and having, partly by money and promises, and\npartly by threatening and torture, brought two fellows to confess the\nparticulars, and the names of the persons concerned, they were presently\napprehended, till, one accusing another, no less than sixteen men were\nseized and put into irons, whereof I was one.\n\nThe captain, who was made desperate by his danger, resolving to clear\nthe ship of his enemies, tried us all, and we were all condemned to die.\nThe manner of his process I was too young to take notice of; but the\npurser and one of the gunners were hanged immediately, and I expected it\nwith the rest. I do not remember any great concern I was under about it,\nonly that I cried very much, for I knew little then of this world, and\nnothing at all of the next.\n\nHowever, the captain contented himself with executing these two, and\nsome of the rest, upon their humble submission and promise of future\ngood behaviour, were pardoned; but five were ordered to be set on shore\non the island and left there, of which I was one. My master used all his\ninterest with the captain to have me excused, but could not obtain it;\nfor somebody having told him that I was one of them who was singled out\nto have killed him, when my master desired I might not be set on shore,\nthe captain told him I should stay on board if he desired it, but then\nI should be hanged, so he might choose for me which he thought best. The\ncaptain, it seems, was particularly provoked at my being concerned in\nthe treachery, because of his having been so kind to me, and of his\nhaving singled me out to serve him, as I have said above; and this,\nperhaps, obliged him to give my master such a rough choice, either\nto set me on shore or to have me hanged on board. And had my master,\nindeed, known what good-will I had for him, he would not have been long\nin choosing for me; for I had certainly determined to do him a mischief\nthe first opportunity I had for it. This was, therefore, a good\nprovidence for me to keep me from dipping my hands in blood, and it made\nme more tender afterwards in matters of blood than I believe I should\notherwise have been. But as to my being one of them that was to kill\nthe captain, that I was wronged in, for I was not the person, but it was\nreally one of them that were pardoned, he having the good luck not to\nhave that part discovered.\n\nI was now to enter upon a part of independent life, a thing I was indeed\nvery ill prepared to manage, for I was perfectly loose and dissolute\nin my behaviour, bold and wicked while I was under government, and now\nperfectly unfit to be trusted with liberty, for I was as ripe for any\nvillainy as a young fellow that had no solid thought ever placed in his\nmind could be supposed to be. Education, as you have heard, I had none;\nand all the little scenes of life I had passed through had been full\nof dangers and desperate circumstances; but I was either so young or so\nstupid, that I escaped the grief and anxiety of them, for want of having\na sense of their tendency and consequences.\n\nThis thoughtless, unconcerned temper had one felicity indeed in it, that\nit made me daring and ready for doing any mischief, and kept off the\nsorrow which otherwise ought to have attended me when I fell into any\nmischief; that this stupidity was instead of a happiness to me, for it\nleft my thoughts free to act upon means of escape and deliverance in my\ndistress, however great it might be; whereas my companions in the misery\nwere so sunk by their fear and grief, that they abandoned themselves to\nthe misery of their condition, and gave over all thought but of their\nperishing and starving, being devoured by wild beasts, murdered, and\nperhaps eaten by cannibals, and the like.\n\nI was but a young fellow, about seventeen or eighteen; but hearing what\nwas to be my fate, I received it with no appearance of discouragement;\nbut I asked what my master said to it, and being told that he had used\nhis utmost interest to save me, but the captain had answered I should\neither go on shore or be hanged on board, which he pleased, I then gave\nover all hope of being received again. I was not very thankful in my\nthoughts to my master for his soliciting the captain for me, because I\nknew that what he did was not in kindness to me so much as in kindness\nto himself; I mean, to preserve the wages which he got for me, which\namounted to above six dollars a month, including what the captain\nallowed him for my particular service to him.\n\nWhen I understood that my master was so apparently kind, I asked if I\nmight not be admitted to speak with him, and they told me I might, if my\nmaster would come down to me, but I could not be allowed to come up to\nhim; so then I desired my master might be spoke to to come to me, and he\naccordingly came to me. I fell on my knees to him, and begged he would\nforgive me what I had done to displease him; and indeed the resolution\nI had taken to murder him lay with some horror upon my mind just at\nthat time, so that I was once just a-going to confess it, and beg him\nto forgive me, but I kept it in. He told me he had done all he could to\nobtain my pardon of the captain, but could not and he knew no way for me\nbut to have patience, and submit to my fate; and if they came to speak\nwith any ship of their nation at the Cape, he would endeavour to have\nthem stand in, and fetch us off again, if we might be found.\n\nThen I begged I might have my clothes on shore with me. He told me he\nwas afraid I should have little need of clothes, for he did not see how\nwe could long subsist on the island, and that he had been told that the\ninhabitants were cannibals or men-eaters (though he had no reason for\nthat suggestion), and we should not be able to live among them. I\ntold him I was not so afraid of that as I was of starving for want of\nvictuals; and as for the inhabitants being cannibals, I believed we\nshould be more likely to eat them than they us, if we could but get at\nthem. But I was mightily concerned, I said, we should have no weapons\nwith us to defend ourselves, and I begged nothing now, but that he would\ngive me a gun and a sword, with a little powder and shot.\n\nHe smiled, and said they would signify nothing to us, for it was\nimpossible for us to pretend to preserve our lives among such a populous\nand desperate nation as the people of this island were. I told him that,\nhowever, it would do us this good, for we should not be devoured or\ndestroyed immediately; so I begged hard for the gun. At last he told me\nhe did not know whether the captain would give him leave to give me a\ngun, and if not, he durst not do it; but he promised to use his interest\nto obtain it for me, which he did, and the next day he sent me a gun,\nwith some ammunition, but told me the captain would not suffer the\nammunition to be given us till we were set all on shore, and till he\nwas just going to set sail. He also sent me the few clothes I had in the\nship, which indeed were not many.\n\nTwo days after this, we were all carried on shore together; the rest\nof my fellow-criminals hearing I had a gun, and some powder and shot,\nsolicited for liberty to carry the like with them, which was also\ngranted them; and thus we were set on shore to shift for ourselves.\n\nAt our first coming into the island we were terrified exceedingly with\nthe sight of the barbarous people, whose figure was made more terrible\nto us than it really was by the report we had of them from the seamen;\nbut when we came to converse with them awhile, we found they were not\ncannibals, as was reported, or such as would fall immediately upon us\nand eat us up; but they came and sat down by us, and wondered much at\nour clothes and arms, and made signs to give us some victuals, such as\nthey had, which was only roots and plants dug out of the ground for the\npresent, but they brought us fowls and flesh afterwards in good plenty.\n\nThis encouraged the other four men that were with me very much, for they\nwere quite dejected before; but now they began to be very familiar with\nthem, and made signs, that if they would use us kindly, we would stay\nand live with them; which they seemed glad of, though they knew little\nof the necessity we were under to do so, or how much we were afraid of\nthem.\n\nHowever, upon second thoughts we resolved that we would only stay in\nthat part so long as the ship rid in the bay, and then making them\nbelieve we were gone with the ship, we would go and place ourselves, if\npossible, where there were no inhabitants to be seen, and so live as we\ncould, or perhaps watch for a ship that might be driven upon the coast\nas we were.\n\nThe ship continued a fortnight in the roads, repairing some damage which\nhad been done her in the late storm, and taking in wood and water; and\nduring this time, the boat coming often on shore, the men brought us\nseveral refreshments, and the natives believing we only belonged to the\nship, were civil enough. We lived in a kind of a tent on the shore, or\nrather a hut, which we made with the boughs of trees, and sometimes in\nthe night retired to a wood a little out of their way, to let them\nthink we were gone on board the ship. However, we found them barbarous,\ntreacherous, and villainous enough in their nature, only civil from\nfear, and therefore concluded we should soon fall into their hands when\nthe ship was gone.\n\nThe sense of this wrought upon my fellow-sufferers even to distraction;\nand one of them, being a carpenter, in his mad fit, swam off to the ship\nin the night, though she lay then a league to sea, and made such pitiful\nmoan to be taken in, that the captain was prevailed with at last to take\nhim in, though they let him lie swimming three hours in the water before\nhe consented to it.\n\nUpon this, and his humble submission, the captain received him, and, in\na word, the importunity of this man (who for some time petitioned to be\ntaken in, though they hanged him as soon as they had him) was such as\ncould not be resisted; for, after he had swam so long about the ship,\nhe was not able to reach the shore again; and the captain saw evidently\nthat the man must be taken on board or suffered to drown, and the whole\nship's company offering to be bound for him for his good behaviour, the\ncaptain at last yielded, and he was taken up, but almost dead with his\nbeing so long in the water.\n\nWhen this man was got in, he never left importuning the captain, and all\nthe rest of the officers, in behalf of us that were behind, but to\nthe very last day the captain was inexorable; when, at the time their\npreparations were making to sail, and orders given to hoist the boats\ninto the ship, all the seamen in a body came up to the rail of the\nquarter-deck, where the captain was walking with some of his officers,\nand appointing the boatswain to speak for them, he went up, and falling\non his knees to the captain, begged of him, in the humblest manner\npossible, to receive the four men on board again, offering to answer for\ntheir fidelity, or to have them kept in chains till they came to Lisbon,\nand there to be delivered up to justice, rather than, as they said, to\nhave them left to be murdered by savages, or devoured by wild beasts. It\nwas a great while ere the captain took any notice of them, but when he\ndid, he ordered the boatswain to be seized, and threatened to bring him\nto the capstan for speaking for them.\n\nUpon this severity, one of the seamen, bolder than the rest, but still\nwith all possible respect to the captain, besought his honour, as he\ncalled him, that he would give leave to some more of them to go on\nshore, and die with their companions, or, if possible, to assist them\nto resist the barbarians. The captain, rather provoked than cowed with\nthis, came to the barricade of the quarter-deck, and speaking very\nprudently to the men (for had he spoken roughly, two-thirds of them\nwould have left the ship, if not all of them), he told them, it was\nfor their safety as well as his own that he had been obliged to that\nseverity; that mutiny on board a ship was the same thing as treason in a\nking's palace, and he could not answer it to his owners and employers\nto trust the ship and goods committed to his charge with men who had\nentertained thoughts of the worst and blackest nature; that he wished\nheartily that it had been anywhere else that they had been set on shore,\nwhere they might have been in less hazard from the savages; that, if he\nhad designed they should be destroyed, he could as well have executed\nthem on board as the other two; that he wished it had been in some other\npart of the world, where he might have delivered them up to the civil\njustice, or might have left them among Christians; but it was better\ntheir lives were put in hazard than his life, and the safety of the\nship; and that though he did not know that he had deserved so ill of any\nof them as that they should leave the ship rather than do their duty,\nyet if any of them were resolved to do so unless he would consent to\ntake a gang of traitors on board, who, as he had proved before them\nall, had conspired to murder him, he would not hinder them, nor for the\npresent would he resent their importunity; but, if there was nobody left\nin the ship but himself, he would never consent to take them on board.\n\nThis discourse was delivered so well, was in itself so reasonable, was\nmanaged with so much temper, yet so boldly concluded with a negative,\nthat the greatest part of the men were satisfied for the present.\nHowever, as it put the men into juntos and cabals, they were not\ncomposed for some hours; the wind also slackening towards night, the\ncaptain ordered not to weigh till next morning.\n\nThe same night twenty-three of the men, among whom was the gunner's\nmate, the surgeon's assistant, and two carpenters, applying to the chief\nmate told him, that as the captain had given them leave to go on shore\nto their comrades, they begged that he would speak to the captain not to\ntake it ill that they were desirous to go and die with their companions;\nand that they thought they could do no less in such an extremity than\ngo to them; because, if there was any way to save their lives, it was\nby adding to their numbers, and making them strong enough to assist one\nanother in defending themselves against the savages, till perhaps they\nmight one time or other find means to make their escape, and get to\ntheir own country again.\n\nThe mate told them, in so many words, that he durst not speak to the\ncaptain upon any such design, and was very sorry they had no more\nrespect for him than to desire him to go upon such an errand; but, if\nthey were resolved upon such an enterprise, he would advise them to take\nthe long-boat in the morning betimes, and go off, seeing the captain had\ngiven them leave, and leave a civil letter behind them to the captain,\nand to desire him to send his men on shore for the boat, which should be\ndelivered very honestly, and he promised to keep their counsel so long.\n\nAccordingly, an hour before day, those twenty-three men, with every\nman a firelock and a cutlass, with some pistols, three halberds or\nhalf-pikes, and good store of powder and ball, without any provision but\nabout half a hundred of bread, but with all their chests and clothes,\ntools, instruments, books, &c., embarked themselves so silently, that\nthe captain got no notice of it till they were gotten half the way on\nshore.\n\nAs soon as the captain heard of it he called for the gunner's mate, the\nchief gunner being at the time sick in his cabin, and ordered to fire at\nthem; but, to his great mortification, the gunner's mate was one of the\nnumber, and was gone with them; and indeed it was by this means they got\nso many arms and so much ammunition. When the captain found how it was,\nand that there was no help for it, he began to be a little appeased, and\nmade light of it, and called up the men, and spoke kindly to them, and\ntold them he was very well satisfied in the fidelity and ability of\nthose that were now left, and that he would give to them, for their\nencouragement, to be divided among them, the wages which were due to the\nmen that were gone, and that it was a great satisfaction to him that the\nship was free from such a mutinous rabble, who had not the least reason\nfor their discontent.\n\nThe men seemed very well satisfied, and particularly the promise of the\nwages of those who were gone went a great way with them. After this, the\nletter which was left by the men was given to the captain by his boy,\nwith whom, it seems, the men had left it. The letter was much to the\nsame purpose of what they had said to the mate, and which he declined to\nsay for them, only that at the end of their letter they told the captain\nthat, as they had no dishonest design, so they had taken nothing away\nwith them which was not their own, except some arms and ammunition, such\nas were absolutely necessary to them, as well for their defence against\nthe savages as to kill fowls or beasts for their food, that they might\nnot perish; and as there were considerable sums due to them for wages,\nthey hoped he would allow the arms and ammunition upon their accounts.\nThey told him that, as to the ship's longboat, which they had taken to\nbring them on shore, they knew it was necessary to him, and they were\nvery willing to restore it to him, and if he pleased to send for it, it\nshould be very honestly delivered to his men, and not the least injury\noffered to any of those who came for it, nor the least persuasion or\ninvitation made use of to any of them to stay with them; and, at the\nbottom of the letter, they very humbly besought him that, for their\ndefence, and for the safety of their lives, he would be pleased to send\nthem a barrel of powder and some ammunition, and give them leave to keep\nthe mast and sail of the boat, that if it was possible for them to make\nthemselves a boat of any kind, they might shift off to sea, to save\nthemselves in such part of the world as their fate should direct them\nto.\n\nUpon this the captain, who had won much upon the rest of his men by what\nhe had said to them, and was very easy as to the general peace (for it\nwas very true that the most mutinous of the men were gone), came out\nto the quarter-deck, and, calling the men together, let them know the\nsubstance of the letter, and told the men that, however they had not\ndeserved such civility from him, yet he was not willing to expose them\nmore than they were willing to expose themselves; he was inclined to\nsend them some ammunition, and as they had desired but one barrel of\npowder, he would send them two barrels, and shot, or lead and moulds to\nmake shot, in proportion; and, to let them see that he was civiller to\nthem than they deserved, he ordered a cask of arrack and a great bag\nof bread to be sent them for subsistence till they should be able to\nfurnish themselves.\n\nThe rest of the men applauded the captain's generosity, and every one\nof them sent us something or other, and about three in the afternoon the\npinnace came on shore, and brought us all these things, which we were\nvery glad of, and returned the long-boat accordingly; and as to the men\nthat came with the pinnace, as the captain had singled out such men as\nhe knew would not come over to us, so they had positive orders not to\nbring any one of us on board again, upon pain of death; and indeed both\nwere so true to our points, that we neither asked them to stay, nor they\nus to go.\n\nWe were now a good troop, being in all twenty-seven men, very well\narmed, and provided with everything but victuals; we had two carpenters\namong us, a gunner, and, which was worth all the rest, a surgeon or\ndoctor; that is to say, he was an assistant to a surgeon at Goa, and was\nentertained as a supernumerary with us. The carpenters had brought all\ntheir tools, the doctor all his instruments and medicines, and indeed we\nhad a great deal of baggage, that is to say, on the whole, for some of\nus had little more than the clothes on our backs, of whom I was one;\nbut I had one thing which none of them had, viz., I had the twenty-two\nmoidores of gold which I had stole at the Brazils, and two pieces of\neight. The two pieces of eight I showed, and one moidore, and none of\nthem ever suspected that I had any more money in the world, having been\nknown to be only a poor boy taken up in charity, as you have heard,\nand used like a slave, and in the worst manner of a slave, by my cruel\nmaster the pilot.\n\nIt will be easy to imagine we four that were left at first were joyful,\nnay, even surprised with joy at the coming of the rest, though at first\nwe were frighted, and thought they came to fetch us back to hang us;\nbut they took ways quickly to satisfy us that they were in the same\ncondition with us, only with this additional circumstance, theirs was\nvoluntary, and ours by force.\n\nThe first piece of news they told us after the short history of their\ncoming away was, that our companion was on board, but how he got\nthither we could not imagine, for he had given us the slip, and we never\nimagined he could swim so well as to venture off to the ship, which lay\nat so great a distance; nay, we did not so much as know that he could\nswim at all, and not thinking anything of what really happened, we\nthought he must have wandered into the woods and was devoured, or\nwas fallen into the hands of the natives, and was murdered; and these\nthoughts filled us with fears enough, and of several kinds, about its\nbeing some time or other our lot to fall into their hands also. But\nhearing how he had with much difficulty been received on board the ship\nagain and pardoned, we were much better satisfied than before.\n\nBeing now, as I have said, a considerable number of us, and in condition\nto defend ourselves, the first thing we did was to give every one his\nhand that we would not separate from one another upon any occasion\nwhatsoever, but that we would live and die together; that we would kill\nno food, but that we would distribute it in public; and that we would\nbe in all things guided by the majority, and not insist upon our own\nresolutions in anything if the majority were against it; that we would\nappoint a captain among us to be our governor or leader during pleasure;\nthat while he was in office we would obey him without reserve, on pain\nof death; and that every one should take turn, but the captain was not\nto act in any particular thing without advice of the rest, and by the\nmajority.\n\nHaving established these rules, we resolved to enter into some measures\nfor our food, and for conversing with the inhabitants or natives of the\nisland for our supply. As for food, they were at first very useful to\nus, but we soon grew weary of them, being an ignorant, ravenous, brutish\nsort of people, even worse than the natives of any other country that we\nhad seen; and we soon found that the principal part of our subsistence\nwas to be had by our guns, shooting of deer and other creatures, and\nfowls of all other sorts, of which there is abundance.\n\nWe found the natives did not disturb or concern themselves much about\nus; nor did they inquire, or perhaps know, whether we stayed among them\nor not, much less that our ship was gone quite away, and had cast us\noff, as was our case; for the next morning, after we had sent back the\nlong-boat, the ship stood away to the south-east, and in four hours'\ntime was out of our sight.\n\nThe next day two of us went out into the country one way, and two\nanother, to see what kind of a land we were in; and we soon found the\ncountry was very pleasant and fruitful, and a convenient place enough\nto live in; but, as before, inhabited by a parcel of creatures scarce\nhuman, or capable of being made social on any account whatsoever.\n\nWe found the place full of cattle and provisions; but whether we might\nventure to take them where we could find them or not, we did not know;\nand though we were under a necessity to get provisions, yet we were loth\nto bring down a whole nation of devils upon us at once, and therefore\nsome of our company agreed to try to speak with some of the country,\nif we could, that we might see what course was to be taken with them.\nEleven of our men went on this errand, well armed and furnished for\ndefence. They brought word that they had seen some of the natives, who\nappeared very civil to them, but very shy and afraid, seeing their guns,\nfor it was easy to perceive that the natives knew what their guns were,\nand what use they were of.\n\nThey made signs to the natives for some food, and they went and fetched\nseveral herbs and roots, and some milk; but it was evident they did not\ndesign to give it away, but to sell it, making signs to know what our\nmen would give them.\n\nOur men were perplexed at this, for they had nothing to barter; however,\none of the men pulled out a knife and showed them, and they were so fond\nof it that they were ready to go together by the ears for the knife. The\nseaman seeing that, was willing to make a good market of his knife, and\nkeeping them chaffering about it a good while, some offered him roots,\nand others milk; at last one offered him a goat for it, which he took.\nThen another of our men showed them another knife, but they had nothing\ngood enough for that, whereupon one of them made signs that he would\ngo and fetch something; so our men stayed three hours for their return,\nwhen they came back and brought him a small-sized, thick, short cow,\nvery fat and good meat, and gave him for his knife.\n\nThis was a good market, but our misfortune was we had no merchandise;\nfor our knives were as needful to us as to them, and but that we were in\ndistress for food, and must of necessity have some, these men would not\nhave parted with their knives.\n\nHowever, in a little time more we found that the woods were full of\nliving creatures, which we might kill for our food, and that without\ngiving offence to them; so that our men went daily out a-hunting, and\nnever failed in killing something or other; for, as to the natives, we\nhad no goods to barter; and for money, all the stock among us would not\nhave subsisted us long. However, we called a general council to see what\nmoney we had, and to bring it all together, that it might go as far as\npossible; and when it came to my turn, I pulled out a moidore and the\ntwo dollars I spoke of before.\n\nThis moidore I ventured to show, that they might not despise me too much\nfor adding too little to the store, and that they might not pretend to\nsearch me; and they were very civil to me, upon the presumption that I\nhad been so faithful to them as not to conceal anything from them.\n\nBut our money did us little service, for the people neither knew\nthe value or the use of it, nor could they justly rate the gold in\nproportion with the silver; so that all our money, which was not much\nwhen it was all put together, would go but a little way with us, that is\nto say, to buy us provisions.\n\nOur next consideration was to get away from this cursed place, and\nwhither to go. When my opinion came to be asked, I told them I would\nleave that all to them, and I told them I had rather they would let me\ngo into the woods to get them some provisions, than consult with me, for\nI would agree to whatever they did; but they would not agree to that,\nfor they would not consent that any of us should go into the woods\nalone; for though we had yet seen no lions or tigers in the woods, we\nwere assured there were many in the island, besides other creatures\nas dangerous, and perhaps worse, as we afterwards found by our own\nexperience.\n\nWe had many adventures in the woods, for our provisions, and often met\nwith wild and terrible beasts, which we could not call by their names;\nbut as they were, like us, seeking their prey, but were themselves good\nfor nothing, so we disturbed them as little as possible.\n\nOur consultations concerning our escape from this place, which, as I\nhave said, we were now upon, ended in this only, that as we had two\ncarpenters among us, and that they had tools almost of all sorts with\nthem, we should try to build us a boat to go off to sea with, and that\nthen, perhaps, we might find our way back to Goa, or land on some more\nproper place to make our escape. The counsels of this assembly were\nnot of great moment, yet as they seem to be introductory of many more\nremarkable adventures which happened under my conduct hereabouts many\nyears after, I think this miniature of my future enterprises may not be\nunpleasant to relate.\n\nTo the building of a boat I made no objection, and away they went to\nwork immediately; but as they went on, great difficulties occurred,\nsuch as the want of saws to cut our plank; nails, bolts, and spikes, to\nfasten the timbers; hemp, pitch, and tar, to caulk and pay her seams,\nand the like. At length, one of the company proposed that, instead of\nbuilding a bark or sloop, or shallop, or whatever they would call\nit, which they found was so difficult, they would rather make a large\nperiagua, or canoe, which might be done with great ease.\n\nIt was presently objected, that we could never make a canoe large enough\nto pass the great ocean, which we were to go over to get to the coast\nof Malabar; that it not only would not bear the sea, but it would never\nbear the burden, for we were not only twenty-seven men of us, but had\na great deal of luggage with us, and must, for our provision, take in a\ngreat deal more.\n\nI never proposed to speak in their general consultations before, but\nfinding they were at some loss about what kind of vessel they should\nmake, and how to make it, and what would be fit for our use, and what\nnot, I told them I found they were at a full stop in their counsels of\nevery kind; that it was true we could never pretend to go over to Goa on\nthe coast of Malabar in a canoe, which though we could all get into\nit, and that it would bear the sea well enough, yet would not hold our\nprovisions, and especially we could not put fresh water enough into it\nfor the voyage; and to make such an adventure would be nothing but mere\nrunning into certain destruction, and yet that nevertheless I was for\nmaking a canoe.\n\nThey answered, that they understood all I had said before well enough,\nbut what I meant by telling them first how dangerous and impossible\nit was to make our escape in a canoe, and yet then to advise making a\ncanoe, that they could not understand.\n\nTo this I answered, that I conceived our business was not to attempt our\nescape in a canoe, but that, as there were other vessels at sea besides\nour ship, and that there were few nations that lived on the sea-shore\nthat were so barbarous, but that they went to sea in some boats or\nother, our business was to cruise along the coast of the island, which\nwas very long, and to seize upon the first we could get that was better\nthan our own, and so from that to another, till perhaps we might at last\nget a good ship to carry us wherever we pleased to go.\n\n\"Excellent advice,\" says one of them. \"Admirable advice,\" says another.\n\"Yes, yes,\" says the third (which was the gunner), \"the English dog has\ngiven excellent advice; but it is just the way to bring us all to\nthe gallows. The rogue has given us devilish advice, indeed, to go\na-thieving, till from a little vessel we came to a great ship, and so we\nshall turn downright pirates, the end of which is to be hanged.\"\n\n\"You may call us pirates,\" says another, \"if you will, and if we fall\ninto bad hands, we may be used like pirates; but I care not for that,\nI'll be a pirate, or anything, nay, I'll be hanged for a pirate rather\nthan starve here, therefore I think the advice is very good.\" And so\nthey cried all, \"Let us have a canoe.\" The gunner, over-ruled by the\nrest, submitted; but as we broke up the council, he came to me, takes\nme by the hand, and, looking into the palm of my hand, and into my face\ntoo, very gravely, \"My lad,\" says he, \"thou art born to do a world of\nmischief; thou hast commenced pirate very young; but have a care of\nthe gallows, young man; have a care, I say, for thou wilt be an eminent\nthief.\"\n\nI laughed at him, and told him I did not know what I might come to\nhereafter, but as our case was now, I should make no scruple to take the\nfirst ship I came at to get our liberty; I only wished we could see one,\nand come at her. Just while we were talking, one of our men that was at\nthe door of our hut, told us that the carpenter, who it seems was upon a\nhill at a distance, cried out, \"A sail! a sail!\"\n\nWe all turned out immediately; but, though it was very clear weather,\nwe could see nothing; but the carpenter continuing to halloo to us, \"A\nsail! a sail!\" away we run up the hill, and there we saw a ship plainly;\nbut it was at a very great distance, too far for us to make any signal\nto her. However, we made a fire upon the hill, with all the wood we\ncould get together, and made as much smoke as possible. The wind was\ndown, and it was almost calm; but as we thought, by a perspective glass\nwhich the gunner had in his pocket, her sails were full, and she stood\naway large with the wind at E.N.E., taking no notice of our signal, but\nmaking for the Cape de Bona Speranza; so we had no comfort from her.\n\nWe went, therefore, immediately to work about our intended canoe; and,\nhaving singled out a very large tree to our minds, we fell to work with\nher; and having three good axes among us, we got it down, but it was\nfour days' time first, though we worked very hard too. I do not remember\nwhat wood it was, or exactly what dimensions, but I remember that it was\na very large one, and we were as much encouraged when we launched it,\nand found it swam upright and steady, as we would have been at another\ntime if we had had a good man-of-war at our command.\n\nShe was so very large, that she carried us all very, very easily, and\nwould have carried two or three tons of baggage with us; so that we\nbegan to consult about going to sea directly to Goa; but many other\nconsiderations checked that thought, especially when we came to look\nnearer into it; such as want of provisions, and no casks for fresh\nwater; no compass to steer by; no shelter from the breach of the high\nsea, which would certainly founder us; no defence from the heat of the\nweather, and the like; so that they all came readily into my project, to\ncruise about where we were, and see what might offer.\n\nAccordingly, to gratify our fancy, we went one day all out to sea in her\ntogether, and we were in a very fair way to have had enough of it;\nfor when she had us all on board, and that we were gotten about half\na league to sea, there happening to be a pretty high swell of the sea,\nthough little or no wind, yet she wallowed so in the sea, that we all of\nus thought she would at last wallow herself bottom up; so we set all\nto work to get her in nearer the shore, and giving her fresh way in the\nsea, she swam more steady, and with some hard work we got her under the\nland again.\n\nWe were now at a great loss; the natives were civil enough to us, and\ncame often to discourse with us; one time they brought one whom they\nshowed respect to as a king with them, and they set up a long pole\nbetween them and us, with a great tassel of hair hanging, not on the\ntop, but something above the middle of it, adorned with little chains,\nshells, bits of brass, and the like; and this, we understood afterwards,\nwas a token of amity and friendship; and they brought down to us\nvictuals in abundance, cattle, fowls, herbs, and roots; but we were in\nthe utmost confusion on our side; for we had nothing to buy with, or\nexchange for; and as to giving us things for nothing they had no notion\nof that again. As to our money, it was mere trash to them, they had no\nvalue for it; so that we were in a fair way to be starved. Had we had\nbut some toys and trinkets, brass chains, baubles, glass beads, or, in\na word, the veriest trifles that a shipload of would not have been worth\nthe freight, we might have bought cattle and provisions enough for an\narmy, or to victual a fleet of men-of-war; but for gold or silver we\ncould get nothing.\n\nUpon this we were in a strange consternation. I was but a young fellow,\nbut I was for falling upon them with our firearms, and taking all the\ncattle from them, and send them to the devil to stop their hunger,\nrather than be starved ourselves; but I did not consider that this might\nhave brought ten thousand of them down upon us the next day; and though\nwe might have killed a vast number of them, and perhaps have frighted\nthe rest, yet their own desperation, and our small number, would have\nanimated them so that, one time or other, they would have destroyed us\nall.\n\nIn the middle of our consultation, one of our men who had been a kind\nof a cutler, or worker in iron, started up and asked the carpenter if,\namong all his tools, he could not help him to a file. \"Yes,\" says the\ncarpenter, \"I can, but it is a small one.\" \"The smaller the better,\"\nsays the other. Upon this he goes to work, and first by heating a piece\nof an old broken chisel in the fire, and then with the help of his file,\nhe made himself several kinds of tools for his work. Then he takes three\nor four pieces of eight, and beats them out with a hammer upon a stone,\ntill they were very broad and thin; then he cuts them out into the shape\nof birds and beasts; he made little chains of them for bracelets and\nnecklaces, and turned them into so many devices of his own head, that it\nis hardly to be expressed.\n\nWhen he had for about a fortnight exercised his head and hands at this\nwork, we tried the effect of his ingenuity; and, having another meeting\nwith the natives, were surprised to see the folly of the poor people.\nFor a little bit of silver cut in the shape of a bird, we had two cows,\nand, which was our loss, if it had been in brass, it had been still of\nmore value. For one of the bracelets made of chain-work, we had as much\nprovision of several sorts, as would fairly have been worth, in England,\nfifteen or sixteen pounds; and so of all the rest. Thus, that which when\nit was in coin was not worth sixpence to us, when thus converted\ninto toys and trifles, was worth a hundred times its real value, and\npurchased for us anything we had occasion for.\n\nIn this condition we lived upwards of a year, but all of us began to be\nvery much tired of it, and, whatever came of it, resolved to attempt\nan escape. We had furnished ourselves with no less than three very\ngood canoes; and as the monsoons, or trade-winds, generally affect that\ncountry, blowing in most parts of this island one six months of a year\none way, and the other six months another way, we concluded we might be\nable to bear the sea well enough. But always, when we came to look into\nit, the want of fresh water was the thing that put us off from such an\nadventure, for it is a prodigious length, and what no man on earth could\nbe able to perform without water to drink.\n\nBeing thus prevailed upon by our own reason to set the thoughts of that\nvoyage aside, we had then but two things before us; one was, to put to\nsea the other way; viz., west, and go away for the Cape of Good Hope,\nwhere, first or last, we should meet with some of our own country ships,\nor else to put for the mainland of Africa, and either travel by land,\nor sail along the coast towards the Red Sea, where we should, first or\nlast, find a ship of some nation or other, that would take us up; or\nperhaps we might take them up, which, by-the-bye, was the thing that\nalways ran in my head.\n\nIt was our ingenious cutler, whom ever after we called silversmith, that\nproposed this; but the gunner told him, that he had been in the Red Sea\nin a Malabar sloop, and he knew this, that if we went into the Red Sea,\nwe should either be killed by the wild Arabs, or taken and made slaves\nof by the Turks; and therefore he was not for going that way.\n\nUpon this I took occasion to put in my vote again. \"Why,\" said I, \"do we\ntalk of being killed by the Arabs, or made slaves of by the Turks? Are\nwe not able to board almost any vessel we shall meet with in those seas;\nand, instead of their taking us, we to take them?\" \"Well done, pirate,\"\nsaid the gunner (he that had looked in my hand, and told me I should\ncome to the gallows), \"I'll say that for him,\" says he, \"he always looks\nthe same way. But I think, of my conscience, it is our only way now.\"\n\"Don't tell me,\" says I, \"of being a pirate; we must be pirates, or\nanything, to get fairly out of this cursed place.\"\n\nIn a word, they concluded all, by my advice, that our business was to\ncruise for anything we could see. \"Why then,\" said I to them, \"our first\nbusiness is to see if the people upon this island have no navigation,\nand what boats they use; and, if they have any better or bigger than\nours, let us take one of them.\" First, indeed, all our aim was to get,\nif possible, a boat with a deck and a sail; for then we might have saved\nour provisions, which otherwise we could not.\n\nWe had, to our great good fortune, one sailor among us, who had been\nassistant to the cook; he told us, that he would find a way how to\npreserve our beef without cask or pickle; and this he did effectually\nby curing it in the sun, with the help of saltpetre, of which there was\ngreat plenty in the island; so that, before we found any method for our\nescape, we had dried the flesh of six or seven cows and bullocks,\nand ten or twelve goats, and it relished so well, that we never gave\nourselves the trouble to boil it when we ate it, but either broiled it\nor ate it dry. But our main difficulty about fresh water still remained;\nfor we had no vessel to put any into, much less to keep any for our\ngoing to sea.\n\nBut our first voyage being only to coast the island, we resolved to\nventure, whatever the hazard or consequence of it might be, and in order\nto preserve as much fresh water as we could, our carpenter made a well\nathwart the middle of one of our canoes, which he separated from the\nother parts of the canoe, so as to make it tight to hold the water and\ncovered so as we might step upon it; and this was so large that it held\nnear a hogshead of water very well. I cannot better describe this well\nthan by the same kind which the small fishing-boats in England have to\npreserve their fish alive in; only that this, instead of having holes to\nlet the salt water in, was made sound every way to keep it out; and it\nwas the first invention, I believe, of its kind for such an use; but\nnecessity is a spur to ingenuity and the mother of invention.\n\nIt wanted but a little consultation to resolve now upon our voyage. The\nfirst design was only to coast it round the island, as well to see if we\ncould seize upon any vessel fit to embark ourselves in, as also to take\nhold of any opportunity which might present for our passing over to the\nmain; and therefore our resolution was to go on the inside or west shore\nof the island, where, at least at one point, the land stretching a great\nway to the north-west, the distance is not extraordinary great from the\nisland to the coast of Africa.\n\nSuch a voyage, and with such a desperate crew, I believe was never made,\nfor it is certain we took the worst side of the island to look for any\nshipping, especially for shipping of other nations, this being quite out\nof the way; however, we put to sea, after taking all our provisions and\nammunition, bag and baggage, on board; we had made both mast and sail\nfor our two large periaguas, and the other we paddled along as well as\nwe could; but when a gale sprung up, we took her in tow.\n\nWe sailed merrily forward for several days, meeting with nothing to\ninterrupt us. We saw several of the natives in small canoes catching\nfish, and sometimes we endeavoured to come near enough to speak with\nthem, but they were always shy and afraid of us, making in for the\nshore as soon as we attempted it; till one of our company remembered the\nsignal of friendship which the natives made us from the south part of\nthe island, viz., of setting up a long pole, and put us in mind that\nperhaps it was the same thing to them as a flag of truce to us. So we\nresolved to try it; and accordingly the next time we saw any of their\nfishing-boats at sea we put up a pole in our canoe that had no sail, and\nrowed towards them. As soon as they saw the pole they stayed for us, and\nas we came nearer paddled towards us; when they came to us they showed\nthemselves very much pleased, and gave us some large fish, of which we\ndid not know the names, but they were very good. It was our misfortune\nstill that we had nothing to give them in return; but our artist, of\nwhom I spoke before, gave them two little thin plates of silver, beaten,\nas I said before, out of a piece of eight; they were cut in a diamond\nsquare, longer one way than the other, and a hole punched at one of the\nlongest corners. This they were so fond of that they made us stay till\nthey had cast their lines and nets again, and gave us as many fish as we\ncared to have.\n\nAll this while we had our eyes upon their boats, viewed them very\nnarrowly, and examined whether any of them were fit for our turn, but\nthey were poor, sorry things; their sail was made of a large mat, only\none that was of a piece of cotton stuff fit for little, and their ropes\nwere twisted flags of no strength; so we concluded we were better as\nwe were, and let them alone. We went forward to the north, keeping the\ncoast close on board for twelve days together, and having the wind at\neast and E.S.E., we made very fresh way. We saw no towns on the shore,\nbut often saw some huts by the water-side upon the rocks, and always\nabundance of people about them, who we could perceive run together to\nstare at us.\n\nIt was as odd a voyage as ever man went; we were a little fleet of three\nships, and an army of between twenty and thirty as dangerous fellows as\never they had amongst them; and had they known what we were, they would\nhave compounded to give us everything we desired to be rid of us.\n\nOn the other hand, we were as miserable as nature could well make us to\nbe, for we were upon a voyage and no voyage, we were bound somewhere and\nnowhere; for though we knew what we intended to do, we did really not\nknow what we were doing. We went forward and forward by a northerly\ncourse, and as we advanced the heat increased, which began to be\nintolerable to us, who were on the water, without any covering from heat\nor wet; besides, we were now in the month of October, or thereabouts,\nin a southern latitude; and as we went every day nearer the sun, the sun\ncame also every day nearer to us, till at last we found ourselves in the\nlatitude of 20 degrees; and having passed the tropic about five or six\ndays before that, in a few days more the sun would be in the zenith,\njust over our heads.\n\nUpon these considerations we resolved to seek for a good place to go on\nshore again, and pitch our tents, till the heat of the weather abated.\nWe had by this time measured half the length of the island, and were\ncome to that part where the shore tending away to the north-west,\npromised fair to make our passage over to the mainland of Africa much\nshorter than we expected. But, notwithstanding that, we had good reason\nto believe it was about 120 leagues.\n\nSo, the heats considered, we resolved to take harbour; besides, our\nprovisions were exhausted, and we had not many days' store left.\nAccordingly, putting in for the shore early in the morning, as we\nusually did once in three or four days for fresh water, we sat down and\nconsidered whether we would go on or take up our standing there; but\nupon several considerations, too long to repeat here, we did not like\nthe place, so we resolved to go on a few days longer.\n\nAfter sailing on N.W. by N. with a fresh gale at S.E., about six days,\nwe found, at a great distance, a large promontory or cape of land,\npushing out a long way into the sea, and as we were exceeding fond of\nseeing what was beyond the cape, we resolved to double it before we took\ninto harbour, so we kept on our way, the gale continuing, and yet it\nwas four days more before we reached the cape. But it is not possible\nto express the discouragement and melancholy that seized us all when\nwe came thither; for when we made the headland of the cape, we were\nsurprised to see the shore fall away on the other side as much as it had\nadvanced on this side, and a great deal more; and that, in short, if we\nwould venture over to the shore of Africa, it must be from hence, for\nthat if we went further, the breadth of the sea still increased, and to\nwhat breadth it might increase we knew not.\n\nWhile we mused upon this discovery, we were surprised with very bad\nweather, and especially violent rains, with thunder and lightning,\nmost unusually terrible to us. In this pickle we run for the shore, and\ngetting under the lee of the cape, run our frigates into a little creek,\nwhere we saw the land overgrown with trees, and made all the haste\npossible to get on shore, being exceeding wet, and fatigued with the\nheat, the thunder, lightning, and rain.\n\nHere we thought our case was very deplorable indeed, and therefore our\nartist, of whom I have spoken so often, set up a great cross of wood on\nthe hill which was within a mile of the headland, with these words, but\nin the Portuguese language:--\n\n\"Point Desperation. Jesus have mercy.\"\n\nWe set to work immediately to build us some huts, and to get our clothes\ndried; and though I was young and had no skill in such things, yet I\nshall never forget the little city we built, for it was no less, and we\nfortified it accordingly; and the idea is so fresh in my thought, that I\ncannot but give a short description of it.\n\nOur camp was on the south side of a little creek on the sea, and under\nthe shelter of a steep hill, which lay, though on the other side of\nthe creek, yet within a quarter of a mile of us, N.W. by N., and very\nhappily intercepted the heat of the sun all the after part of the day.\nThe spot we pitched on had a little fresh water brook, or a stream\nrunning into the creek by us; and we saw cattle feeding in the plains\nand low ground east and to the south of us a great way.\n\nHere we set up twelve little huts like soldiers' tents, but made of the\nboughs of trees stuck in the ground, and bound together on the top\nwith withies, and such other things as we could get; the creek was our\ndefence on the north, a little brook on the west, and the south and east\nsides were fortified with a bank, which entirely covered our huts; and\nbeing drawn oblique from the north-west to the south-east, made our city\na triangle. Behind the bank or line our huts stood, having three other\nhuts behind them at a good distance. In one of these, which was a little\none, and stood further off, we put our gunpowder, and nothing else, for\nfear of danger; in the other, which was bigger, we dressed our victuals,\nand put all our necessaries; and in the third, which was biggest of all,\nwe ate our dinners, called our councils, and sat and diverted ourselves\nwith such conversation as we had one with another, which was but\nindifferent truly at that time.\n\nOur correspondence with the natives was absolutely necessary, and our\nartist the cutler having made abundance of those little diamond-cut\nsquares of silver, with these we made shift to traffic with the black\npeople for what we wanted; for indeed they were pleased wonderfully with\nthem, and thus we got plenty of provisions. At first, and in particular,\nwe got about fifty head of black cattle and goats, and our cook's mate\ntook care to cure them and dry them, salt and preserve them for our\ngrand supply; nor was this hard to do, the salt and saltpetre being very\ngood, and the sun excessively hot; and here we lived about four months.\n\nThe southern solstice was over, and the sun gone back towards the\nequinoctial, when we considered of our next adventure, which was to go\nover the sea of Zanguebar, as the Portuguese call it, and to land, if\npossible, upon the continent of Africa.\n\nWe talked with many of the natives about it, such as we could make\nourselves intelligible to, but all that we could learn from them was,\nthat there was a great land of lions beyond the sea, but that it was a\ngreat way off. We knew as well as they that it was a long way, but our\npeople differed mightily about it; some said it was 150 leagues, others\nnot above 100. One of our men, that had a map of the world, showed us\nby his scale that it was not above eighty leagues. Some said there were\nislands all the way to touch at, some that there were no islands at all.\nFor my own part, I knew nothing of this matter one way or another, but\nheard it all without concern, whether it was near or far off; however,\nthis we learned from an old man who was blind and led about by a boy,\nthat if we stayed till the end of August, we should be sure of the wind\nto be fair and the sea smooth all the voyage.\n\nThis was some encouragement; but staying again was very unwelcome news\nto us, because that then the sun would be returning again to the south,\nwhich was what our men were very unwilling to. At last we called a\ncouncil of our whole body; their debates were too tedious to take notice\nof, only to note, that when it came to Captain Bob (for so they called\nme ever since I had taken state upon me before one of their great\nprinces), truly I was on no side; it was not one farthing matter to me,\nI told them, whether we went or stayed; I had no home, and all the world\nwas alike to me; so I left it entirely to them to determine.\n\nIn a word, they saw plainly there was nothing to be done where we were\nwithout shipping; that if our business indeed was only to eat and drink,\nwe could not find a better place in the world; but if our business was\nto get away, and get home into our country, we could not find a worse.\n\nI confess I liked the country wonderfully, and even then had strange\nnotions of coming again to live there; and I used to say to them very\noften that if I had but a ship of twenty guns, and a sloop, and both\nwell manned, I would not desire a better place in the world to make\nmyself as rich as a king.\n\nBut to return to the consultations they were in about going. Upon the\nwhole, it was resolved to venture over for the main; and venture we did,\nmadly enough, indeed, for it was the wrong time of the year to undertake\nsuch a voyage in that country; for, as the winds hang easterly all the\nmonths from September to March, so they generally hang westerly all the\nrest of the year, and blew right in our teeth; so that, as soon as\nwe had, with a kind of a land-breeze, stretched over about fifteen or\ntwenty leagues, and, as I may say, just enough to lose ourselves, we\nfound the wind set in a steady fresh gale or breeze from the sea, at\nwest, W.S.W., or S.W. by W., and never further from the west; so that,\nin a word, we could make nothing of it.\n\nOn the other hand, the vessel, such as we had, would not lie close upon\na wind; if so, we might have stretched away N.N.W., and have met with a\ngreat many islands in our way, as we found afterwards; but we could make\nnothing of it, though we tried, and by the trying had almost undone us\nall; for, stretching away to the north, as near the wind as we could, we\nhad forgotten the shape and position of the island of Madagascar itself;\nhow that we came off at the head of a promontory or point of land, that\nlies about the middle of the island, and that stretches out west a great\nway into the sea; and that now, being run a matter of forty leagues to\nthe north, the shore of the island fell off again above 200 miles to the\neast, so that we were by this time in the wide ocean, between the island\nand the main, and almost 100 leagues from both.\n\nIndeed, as the winds blew fresh at west, as before, we had a smooth sea,\nand we found it pretty good going before it, and so, taking our smallest\ncanoe in tow, we stood in for the shore with all the sail we could make.\nThis was a terrible adventure, for, if the least gust of wind had come,\nwe had been all lost, our canoes being deep and in no condition to make\nway in a high sea.\n\nThis voyage, however, held us eleven days in all; and at length, having\nspent most of our provisions, and every drop of water we had, we spied\nland, to our great joy, though at the distance of ten or eleven leagues;\nand as, under the land, the wind came off like a land-breeze, and blew\nhard against us, we were two days more before we reached the shore,\nhaving all that while excessive hot weather, and not a drop of water or\nany other liquor, except some cordial waters, which one of our company\nhad a little of left in a case of bottles.\n\nThis gave us a taste of what we should have done if we had ventured\nforward with a scant wind and uncertain weather, and gave us a surfeit\nof our design for the main, at least until we might have some better\nvessels under us; so we went on shore again, and pitched our camp\nas before, in as convenient manner as we could, fortifying ourselves\nagainst any surprise; but the natives here were exceeding courteous,\nand much more civil than on the south part of the island; and though we\ncould not understand what they said, or they us, yet we found means to\nmake them understand that we were seafaring men and strangers, and that\nwe were in distress for want of provisions.\n\nThe first proof we had of their kindness was, that as soon as they saw\nus come on shore and begin to make our habitation, one of their captains\nor kings, for we knew not what to call them, came down with five or six\nmen and some women, and brought us five goats and two young fat\nsteers, and gave them to us for nothing; and when we went to offer them\nanything, the captain or the king would not let any of them touch it,\nor take anything of us. About two hours after came another king, or\ncaptain, with forty or fifty men after him. We began to be afraid of\nhim, and laid hands upon our weapons; but he perceiving it, caused two\nmen to go before him, carrying two long poles in their hands, which they\nheld upright, as high as they could, which we presently perceived was\na signal of peace; and these two poles they set up afterwards, sticking\nthem up in the ground; and when the king and his men came to these\ntwo poles, they struck all their lances up in the ground, and came on\nunarmed, leaving their lances, as also their bows and arrows, behind\nthem.\n\nThis was to satisfy us that they were come as friends, and we were glad\nto see it, for we had no mind to quarrel with them if we could help it.\nThe captain of this gang seeing some of our men making up their huts,\nand that they did it but bunglingly, he beckoned to some of his men to\ngo and help us. Immediately fifteen or sixteen of them came and mingled\namong us, and went to work for us; and indeed, they were better workmen\nthan we were, for they run up three or four huts for us in a moment, and\nmuch handsomer done than ours.\n\nAfter this they sent us milk, plantains, pumpkins, and abundance of\nroots and greens that were very good, and then took their leave, and\nwould not take anything from us that we had. One of our men offered the\nking or captain of these men a dram, which he drank and was mightily\npleased with it, and held out his hand for another, which we gave him;\nand in a word, after this, he hardly failed coming to us two or three\ntimes a week, always bringing us something or other; and one time sent\nus seven head of black cattle, some of which we cured and dried as\nbefore.\n\nAnd here I cannot but remember one thing, which afterwards stood us in\ngreat stead, viz., that the flesh of their goats, and their beef also,\nbut especially the former, when we had dried and cured it, looked red,\nand ate hard and firm, as dried beef in Holland; they were so pleased\nwith it, and it was such a dainty to them, that at any time after they\nwould trade with us for it, not knowing, or so much as imagining what it\nwas; so that for ten or twelve pounds' weight of smoke-dried beef, they\nwould give us a whole bullock, or cow, or anything else we could desire.\n\nHere we observed two things that were very material to us, even\nessentially so; first, we found they had a great deal of earthenware\nhere, which they made use of many ways as we did; particularly they had\nlong, deep earthen pots, which they used to sink into the ground, to\nkeep the water which they drunk cool and pleasant; and the other was,\nthat they had larger canoes than their neighbours had.\n\nBy this we were prompted to inquire if they had no larger vessels than\nthose we saw there, or if any other of the inhabitants had not such.\nThey signified presently that they had no larger boats than that they\nshowed us; but that on the other side of the island they had larger\nboats, and that with decks upon them, and large sails; and this made us\nresolve to coast round the whole island to see them; so we prepared and\nvictualled our canoe for the voyage, and, in a word, went to sea for the\nthird time.\n\nIt cost us a month or six weeks' time to perform this voyage, in which\ntime we went on shore several times for water and provisions, and found\nthe natives always very free and courteous; but we were surprised one\nmorning early, being at the extremity of the northernmost part of the\nisland, when one of our men cried out, \"A sail! a sail!\" We presently\nsaw a vessel a great way out at sea; but after we had looked at it with\nour perspective glasses, and endeavoured all we could to make out what\nit was, we could not tell what to think of it; for it was neither ship,\nketch, galley, galliot, or like anything that we had ever seen before;\nall that we could make of it was, that it went from us, standing out to\nsea. In a word, we soon lost sight of it, for we were in no condition\nto chase anything, and we never saw it again; but, by all that we could\nperceive of it, from what we saw of such things afterwards, it was some\nArabian vessel, which had been trading to the coast of Mozambique, or\nZanzibar, the same place where we afterwards went, as you shall hear.\n\nI kept no journal of this voyage, nor indeed did I all this while\nunderstand anything of navigation, more than the common business of a\nforemast-man; so I can say nothing to the latitudes or distances of any\nplaces we were at, how long we were going, or how far we sailed in\na day; but this I remember, that being now come round the island, we\nsailed up the eastern shore due south, as we had done down the western\nshore due north before.\n\nNor do I remember that the natives differed much from one another,\neither in stature or complexion, or in their manners, their habits,\ntheir weapons, or indeed in anything; and yet we could not perceive that\nthey had any intelligence one with another; but they were extremely kind\nand civil to us on this side, as well as on the other.\n\nWe continued our voyage south for many weeks, though with several\nintervals of going on shore to get provisions and water. At length,\ncoming round a point of land which lay about a league further than\nordinary into the sea, we were agreeably surprised with a sight which,\nno doubt, had been as disagreeable to those concerned, as it was\npleasant to us. This was the wreck of an European ship, which had been\ncast away upon the rocks, which in that place run a great way into the\nsea.\n\nWe could see plainly, at low water, a great deal of the ship lay dry;\neven at high water, she was not entirely covered; and that at most she\ndid not lie above a league from the shore. It will easily be believed\nthat our curiosity led us, the wind and weather also permitting, to\ngo directly to her, which we did without any difficulty, and presently\nfound that it was a Dutch-built ship, and that she could not have been\nvery long in that condition, a great deal of the upper work of her stern\nremaining firm, with the mizzen-mast standing. Her stern seemed to be\njammed in between two ridges of the rock, and so remained fast, all the\nfore part of the ship having been beaten to pieces.\n\nWe could see nothing to be gotten out of the wreck that was worth our\nwhile; but we resolved to go on shore, and stay some time thereabouts,\nto see if perhaps we might get any light into the story of her; and\nwe were not without hopes that we might hear something more particular\nabout her men, and perhaps find some of them on shore there, in the same\ncondition that we were in, and so might increase our company.\n\nIt was a very pleasant sight to us when, coming on shore, we saw all\nthe marks and tokens of a ship-carpenter's yard; as a launch-block and\ncradles, scaffolds and planks, and pieces of planks, the remains of\nthe building a ship or vessel; and, in a word, a great many things\nthat fairly invited us to go about the same work; and we soon came to\nunderstand that the men belonging to the ship that was lost had saved\nthemselves on shore, perhaps in their boat, and had built themselves a\nbarque or sloop, and so were gone to sea again; and, inquiring of the\nnatives which way they went, they pointed to the south and south-west,\nby which we could easily understand they were gone away to the Cape of\nGood Hope.\n\nNobody will imagine we could be so dull as not to gather from hence that\nwe might take the same method for our escape; so we resolved first, in\ngeneral, that we would try if possible to build us a boat of one kind or\nother, and go to sea as our fate should direct.\n\nIn order to this our first work was to have the two carpenters search\nabout to see what materials the Dutchmen had left behind them that might\nbe of use; and, in particular, they found one that was very useful,\nand which I was much employed about, and that was a pitch-kettle, and a\nlittle pitch in it.\n\nWhen we came to set close to this work we found it very laborious and\ndifficult, having but few tools, no ironwork, no cordage, no sails; so\nthat, in short, whatever we built, we were obliged to be our own smiths,\nrope-makers, sail-makers, and indeed to practise twenty trades that we\nknew little or nothing of. However, necessity was the spur to invention,\nand we did many things which before we thought impracticable, that is to\nsay, in our circumstances.\n\nAfter our two carpenters had resolved upon the dimensions of what they\nwould build, they set us all to work, to go off in our boats and split\nup the wreck of the old ship, and to bring away everything we could; and\nparticularly that, if possible, we should bring away the mizzen-mast,\nwhich was left standing, which with much difficulty we effected, after\nabove twenty days' labour of fourteen of our men.\n\nAt the same time we got out a great deal of ironwork, as bolts, spikes,\nnails, &c., all of which our artist, of whom I have spoken already, who\nwas now grown a very dexterous smith, made us nails and hinges for our\nrudder, and spikes such as we wanted.\n\nBut we wanted an anchor, and if we had had an anchor, we could not have\nmade a cable; so we contented ourselves with making some ropes with the\nhelp of the natives, of such stuff as they made their mats of, and with\nthese we made such a kind of cable or tow-line as was sufficient to\nfasten our vessel to the shore, which we contented ourselves with for\nthat time.\n\nTo be short, we spent four months here, and worked very hard too; at the\nend of which time we launched our frigate, which, in a few words, had\nmany defects, but yet, all things considered, it was as well as we could\nexpect it to be.\n\nIn short, it was a kind of sloop, of the burthen of near eighteen\nor twenty tons; and had we had masts and sails, standing and running\nrigging, as is usual in such cases, and other conveniences, the vessel\nmight have carried us wherever we could have had a mind to go; but of\nall the materials we wanted, this was the worst, viz., that we had no\ntar or pitch to pay the seams and secure the bottom; and though we did\nwhat we could, with tallow and oil, to make a mixture to supply that\npart, yet we could not bring it to answer our end fully; and when we\nlaunched her into the water, she was so leaky, and took in the water so\nfast, that we thought all our labour had been lost, for we had much ado\nto make her swim; and as for pumps, we had none, nor had we any means to\nmake one.\n\nBut at length one of the natives, a black negro-man, showed us a tree,\nthe wood of which being put into the fire, sends forth a liquid that is\nas glutinous and almost as strong as tar, and of which, by boiling, we\nmade a sort of stuff which served us for pitch, and this answered our\nend effectually; for we perfectly made our vessel sound and tight, so\nthat we wanted no pitch or tar at all. This secret has stood me in stead\nupon many occasions since that time in the same place.\n\nOur vessel being thus finished, out of the mizzen-mast of the ship we\nmade a very good mast to her, and fitted our sails to it as well as we\ncould; then we made a rudder and tiller, and, in a word, everything that\nour present necessity called upon us for; and having victualled her, and\nput as much fresh water on board as we thought we wanted, or as we knew\nhow to stow (for we were yet without casks), we put to sea with a fair\nwind.\n\nWe had spent near another year in these rambles, and in this piece\nof work; for it was now, as our men said, about the beginning of\nour February, and the sun went from us apace, which was much to our\nsatisfaction, for the heats were exceedingly violent. The wind, as I\nsaid, was fair; for, as I have since learned, the winds generally spring\nup to the eastward, as the sun goes from them to the north.\n\nOur debate now was, which way we should go, and never were men so\nirresolute; some were for going to the east, and stretching away\ndirectly for the coast of Malabar; but others, who considered more\nseriously the length of that voyage, shook their heads at the proposal,\nknowing very well that neither our provisions, especially of water,\nor our vessel, were equal to such a run as that is, of near 2000 miles\nwithout any land to touch at in the way.\n\nThese men, too, had all along had a great mind to a voyage for the\nmainland of Africa, where they said we should have a fair cast for our\nlives, and might be sure to make ourselves rich, which way soever we\nwent, if we were but able to make our way through, whether by sea or by\nland.\n\nBesides, as the case stood with us, we had not much choice for our way;\nfor, if we had resolved for the east, we were at the wrong season of the\nyear, and must have stayed till April or May before we had gone to sea.\nAt length, as we had the wind at S.E. and E.S.E., and fine promising\nweather, we came all into the first proposal, and resolved for the coast\nof Africa; nor were we long in disputing as to our coasting the island\nwhich we were upon, for we were now upon the wrong side of the island\nfor the voyage we intended; so we stood away to the north, and, having\nrounded the cape, we hauled away southward, under the lee of the island,\nthinking to reach the west point of land, which, as I observed before,\nruns out so far towards the coast of Africa, as would have shortened our\nrun almost 100 leagues. But when we had sailed about thirty leagues, we\nfound the winds variable under the shore, and right against us, so we\nconcluded to stand over directly, for then we had the wind fair, and our\nvessel was but very ill fated to lie near the wind, or any way indeed\nbut just before it.\n\nHaving resolved upon it, therefore, we put into the shore to furnish\nourselves again with fresh water and other provisions, and about the\nlatter end of March, with more courage than discretion, more resolution\nthan judgment, we launched for the main coast of Africa.\n\nAs for me, I had no anxieties about it, so that we had but a view of\nreaching some land or other, I cared not what or where it was to be,\nhaving at this time no views of what was before me, nor much thought of\nwhat might or might not befall me; but with as little consideration as\nany one can be supposed to have at my age, I consented to everything\nthat was proposed, however hazardous the thing itself, however\nimprobable the success.\n\nThe voyage, as it was undertaken with a great deal of ignorance and\ndesperation, so really it was not carried on with much resolution or\njudgment; for we knew no more of the course we were to steer than this,\nthat it was anywhere about the west, within two or three points N. or\nS., and as we had no compass with us but a little brass pocket compass,\nwhich one of our men had more by accident than otherwise, so we could\nnot be very exact in our course.\n\nHowever, as it pleased God that the wind continued fair at S.E. and by\nE., we found that N.W. by W., which was right afore it, was as good a\ncourse for us as any we could go, and thus we went on.\n\nThe voyage was much longer than we expected; our vessel also, which had\nno sail that was proportioned to her, made but very little way in the\nsea, and sailed heavily. We had, indeed, no great adventures happened\nin this voyage, being out of the way of everything that could offer to\ndivert us; and as for seeing any vessel, we had not the least occasion\nto hail anything in all the voyage; for we saw not one vessel, small\nor great, the sea we were upon being entirely out of the way of all\ncommerce; for the people of Madagascar knew no more of the shores of\nAfrica than we did, only that there was a country of lions, as they call\nit, that way.\n\nWe had been eight or nine days under sail, with a fair wind, when, to\nour great joy, one of our men cried out \"Land!\" We had great reason to\nbe glad of the discovery, for we had not water enough left for above two\nor three days more, though at a short allowance. However, though it was\nearly in the morning when we discovered it, we made it near night before\nwe reached it, the wind slackening almost to a calm, and our ship being,\nas I said, a very dull sailer.\n\nWe were sadly baulked upon our coming to the land, when we found that,\ninstead of the mainland of Africa, it was only a little island, with no\ninhabitants upon it, at least none that we could find; nor any cattle,\nexcept a few goats, of which we killed three only. However, they served\nus for fresh meat, and we found very good water; and it was fifteen days\nmore before we reached the main, which, however, at last we arrived at,\nand which was most essential to us, as we came to it just as all our\nprovisions were spent. Indeed, we may say they were spent first, for we\nhad but a pint of water a day to each man for the last two days. But, to\nour great joy, we saw the land, though at a great distance, the evening\nbefore, and by a pleasant gale in the night were by morning within two\nleagues of the shore.\n\nWe never scrupled going ashore at the first place we came at, though,\nhad we had patience, we might have found a very fine river a little\nfarther north. However, we kept our frigate on float by the help of two\ngreat poles, which we fastened into the ground to moor her, like poles;\nand the little weak ropes, which, as I said, we had made of matting,\nserved us well enough to make the vessel fast.\n\nAs soon as we had viewed the country a little, got fresh water, and\nfurnished ourselves with some victuals, which we found very scarce here,\nwe went on board again with our stores. All we got for provision was\nsome fowls that we killed, and a kind of wild buffalo or bull, very\nsmall, but good meat; I say, having got these things on board, we\nresolved to sail along the coast, which lay N.N.E., till we found some\ncreek or river, that we might run up into the country, or some town\nor people; for we had reason enough to know the place was inhabited,\nbecause we several times saw fires in the night, and smoke in the day,\nevery way at a distance from us.\n\nAt length we came to a very large bay, and in it several little creeks\nor rivers emptying themselves into the sea, and we ran boldly into the\nfirst creek we came at; where, seeing some huts and wild people about\nthem on the shore, we ran our vessel into a little cove on the north\nside of the creek, and held up a long pole, with a white bit of cloth\non it, for a signal of peace to them. We found they understood us\npresently, for they came flocking to us, men, women, and children, most\nof them, of both sexes, stark naked. At first they stood wondering\nand staring at us, as if we had been monsters, and as if they had been\nfrighted; but we found they inclined to be familiar with us afterwards.\nThe first thing we did to try them, was, we held up our hands to our\nmouths, as if we were to drink, signifying that we wanted water. This\nthey understood presently, and three of their women and two boys ran\naway up the land, and came back in about half a quarter of an hour, with\nseveral pots, made of earth, pretty enough, and baked, I suppose, in\nthe sun; these they brought us full of water, and set them down near the\nsea-shore, and there left them, going back a little, that we might fetch\nthem, which we did.\n\nSome time after this, they brought us roots and herbs, and some fruits\nwhich I cannot remember, and gave us; but as we had nothing to give\nthem, we found them not so free as the people in Madagascar were.\nHowever, our cutler went to work, and, as he had saved some iron out\nof the wreck of the ship, he made abundance of toys, birds, dogs, pins,\nhooks, and rings; and we helped to file them, and make them bright for\nhim, and when we gave them some of these, they brought us all sorts of\nprovisions they had, such as goats, hogs, and cows, and we got victuals\nenough.\n\nWe were now landed upon the continent of Africa, the most desolate,\ndesert, and inhospitable country in the world, even Greenland and Nova\nZembla itself not excepted, with this difference only, that even the\nworst part of it we found inhabited, though, taking the nature and\nquality of some of the inhabitants, it might have been much better to us\nif there had been none.\n\nAnd, to add to the exclamation I am making on the nature of the place,\nit was here that we took one of the rashest, and wildest, and most\ndesperate resolutions that ever was taken by man, or any number of men,\nin the world; this was, to travel overland through the heart of the\ncountry, from the coast of Mozambique, on the east ocean, to the coast\nof Angola or Guinea, on the western or Atlantic Ocean, a continent of\nland of at least 1800 miles, in which journey we had excessive heats to\nsupport, unpassable deserts to go over, no carriages, camels, or beasts\nof any kind to carry our baggage, innumerable numbers of wild and\nravenous beasts to encounter with, such as lions, leopards, tigers,\nlizards, and elephants; we had the equinoctial line to pass under, and,\nconsequently, were in the very centre of the torrid zone; we had nations\nof savages to encounter with, barbarous and brutish to the last degree;\nhunger and thirst to struggle with, and, in one word, terrors enough to\nhave daunted the stoutest hearts that ever were placed in cases of flesh\nand blood.\n\nYet, fearless of all these, we resolved to adventure, and accordingly\nmade such preparations for our journey as the place we were in would\nallow us, and such as our little experience of the country seemed to\ndictate to us.\n\nIt had been some time already that we had been used to tread barefooted\nupon the rocks, the gravel, the grass, and the sand on the shore; but as\nwe found the worst thing for our feet was the walking or travelling on\nthe dry burning sands, within the country, so we provided ourselves with\na sort of shoes, made of the skins of wild beasts, with the hair inward,\nand being dried in the sun, the outsides were thick and hard, and would\nlast a great while. In short, as I called them, so I think the term very\nproper still, we made us gloves for our feet, and we found them very\nconvenient and very comfortable.\n\nWe conversed with some of the natives of the country, who were friendly\nenough. What tongue they spoke I do not yet pretend to know. We\ntalked as far as we could make them understand us, not only about our\nprovisions, but also about our undertaking, and asked them what country\nlay that way, pointing west with our hands. They told us but little to\nour purpose, only we thought, by all their discourse, that there were\npeople to be found, of one sort or other, everywhere; that there were\nmany great rivers, many lions and tigers, elephants, and furious wild\ncats (which in the end we found to be civet cats), and the like.\n\nWhen we asked them if any one had ever travelled that way, they told\nus yes, some had gone to where the sun sleeps, meaning to the west, but\nthey could not tell us who they were. When we asked for some to guide\nus, they shrunk up their shoulders as Frenchmen do when they are afraid\nto undertake a thing. When we asked them about the lions and wild\ncreatures, they laughed, and let us know that they would do us no hurt,\nand directed us to a good way indeed to deal with them, and that was to\nmake some fire, which would always fright them away; and so indeed we\nfound it.\n\nUpon these encouragements we resolved upon our journey, and many\nconsiderations put us upon it, which, had the thing itself been\npracticable, we were not so much to blame for as it might otherwise be\nsupposed; I will name some of them, not to make the account too tedious.\n\nFirst, we were perfectly destitute of means to work about our own\ndeliverance any other way; we were on shore in a place perfectly remote\nfrom all European navigation; so that we could never think of being\nrelieved, and fetched off by any of our own countrymen in that part of\nthe world. Secondly, if we had adventured to have sailed on along the\ncoast of Mozambique, and the desolate shores of Africa to the north,\ntill we came to the Red Sea, all we could hope for there was to be taken\nby the Arabs, and be sold for slaves to the Turks, which to all of us\nwas little better than death. We could not build anything of a vessel\nthat would carry us over the great Arabian Sea to India, nor could we\nreach the Cape de Bona Speranza, the winds being too variable, and the\nsea in that latitude too tempestuous; but we all knew, if we could cross\nthis continent of land, we might reach some of the great rivers that run\ninto the Atlantic Ocean; and that, on the banks of any of those rivers,\nwe might there build us canoes which would carry us down, if it were\nthousands of miles, so that we could want nothing but food, of which we\nwere assured we might kill sufficient with our guns; and to add to the\nsatisfaction of our deliverance, we concluded we might, every one of\nus, get a quantity of gold, which, if we came safe, would infinitely\nrecompense us for our toil.\n\nI cannot say that in all our consultations I ever began to enter into\nthe weight and merit of any enterprise we went upon till now. My view\nbefore was, as I thought, very good, viz., that we should get into the\nArabian Gulf, or the mouth of the Red Sea; and waiting for some vessel\npassing or repassing there, of which there is plenty, have seized upon\nthe first we came at by force, and not only have enriched ourselves with\nher cargo, but have carried ourselves to what part of the world we had\npleased; but when they came to talk to me of a march of 2000 or 3000\nmiles on foot, of wandering in deserts among lions and tigers, I confess\nmy blood ran chill, and I used all the arguments I could to persuade\nthem against it.\n\nBut they were all positive, and I might as well have held my tongue; so\nI submitted, and told them I would keep to our first law, to be governed\nby the majority, and we resolved upon our journey. The first thing we\ndid was to take an observation, and see whereabouts in the world we\nwere, which we did, and found we were in the latitude of 12 degrees 35\nminutes south of the line. The next thing was to look on the charts, and\nsee the coast of the country we aimed at, which we found to be from 8 to\n11 degrees south latitude, if we went for the coast of Angola, or in 12\nto 29 degrees north latitude, if we made for the river Niger, and the\ncoast of Guinea.\n\nOur aim was for the coast of Angola, which, by the charts we had, lying\nvery near the same latitude we were then in, our course thither was due\nwest; and as we were assured we should meet with rivers, we doubted not\nbut that by their help we might ease our journey, especially if we could\nfind means to cross the great lake, or inland sea, which the natives\ncall Coalmucoa, out of which it is said the river Nile has its source\nor beginning; but we reckoned without our host, as you will see in the\nsequel of our story.\n\nThe next thing we had to consider was, how to carry our baggage, which\nwe were first of all determined not to travel without; neither indeed\nwas it possible for us to do so, for even our ammunition, which was\nabsolutely necessary to us, and on which our subsistence, I mean for\nfood, as well as our safety, and particularly our defence against wild\nbeasts and wild men, depended,--I say, even our ammunition was a load\ntoo heavy for us to carry in a country where the heat was such that we\nshould be load enough for ourselves.\n\nWe inquired in the country, and found there was no beast of burthen\nknown among them, that is to say, neither horses or mules, or asses,\ncamels, or dromedaries; the only creature they had was a kind of\nbuffalo, or tame bull, such a one as we had killed; and that some of\nthese they had brought so to their hand, that they taught them to go and\ncome with their voices, as they called them to them, or sent them from\nthem; that they made them carry burthens; and particularly that they\nwould swim over rivers and lakes upon them, the creatures swimming very\nhigh and strong in the water.\n\nBut we understood nothing of the management of guiding such a\ncreature, or how to bind a burthen upon them; and this last part of our\nconsultation puzzled us extremely. At last I proposed a method for them,\nwhich, after some consideration, they found very convenient; and this\nwas, to quarrel with some of the negro natives, take ten or twelve of\nthem prisoners, and binding them as slaves, cause them to travel with\nus, and make them carry our baggage; which I alleged would be convenient\nand useful many ways as well to show us the way, as to converse with\nother natives for us.\n\nThis counsel was not accepted at first, but the natives soon gave them\nreason to approve it, and also gave them an opportunity to put it in\npractice; for, as our little traffic with the natives was hitherto upon\nthe faith of their first kindness, we found some knavery among them at\nlast; for having bought some cattle of them for our toys, which, as\nI said, our cutler had contrived, one of our men differing with his\nchapman, truly they huffed him in their manner, and, keeping the things\nhe had offered them for the cattle, made their fellows drive away the\ncattle before his face, and laugh at him. Our man crying out loud of\nthis violence, and calling to some of us who were not far off, the negro\nhe was dealing with threw a lance at him, which came so true, that, if\nhe had not with great agility jumped aside, and held up his hand also\nto turn the lance as it came, it had struck through his body; and, as it\nwas, it wounded him in the arm; at which the man, enraged, took up his\nfuzee, and shot the negro through the heart.\n\nThe others that were near him, and all those that were with us at\na distance, were so terribly frighted, first, at the flash of fire;\nsecondly, at the noise; and thirdly, at seeing their countryman killed,\nthat they stood like men stupid and amazed, at first, for some time; but\nafter they were a little recovered from their fright, one of them, at a\ngood distance from us, set up a sudden screaming noise, which, it\nseems, is the noise they make when they go to fight; and all the rest\nunderstanding what he meant, answered him, and ran together to the place\nwhere he was, and we not knowing what it meant, stood still, looking\nupon one another like a parcel of fools.\n\nBut we were presently undeceived; for, in two or three minutes more,\nwe heard the screaming roaring noise go on from one place to another,\nthrough all their little towns; nay, even over the creek to the other\nside; and, on a sudden, we saw a naked multitude running from all parts\nto the place where the first man began it, as to a rendezvous; and, in\nless than an hour, I believe there was near 500 of them gotten together,\narmed some with bows and arrows, but most with lances, which they throw\nat a good distance, so nicely that they will strike a bird flying.\n\nWe had but a very little time for consultation, for the multitude was\nincreasing every moment; and I verily believe, if we had stayed long,\nthey would have been 10,000 together in a little time. We had nothing\nto do, therefore, but to fly to our ship or bark, where indeed we could\nhave defended ourselves very well, or to advance and try what a volley\nor two of small shot would do for us.\n\nWe resolved immediately upon the latter, depending upon it that the fire\nand terror of our shot would soon put them to flight; so we drew up all\nin a line, and marched boldly up to them. They stood ready to meet us,\ndepending, I suppose, to destroy us all with their lances; but before\nwe came near enough for them to throw their lances, we halted, and,\nstanding at a good distance from one another, to stretch our line as far\nas we could, we gave them a salute with our shot, which, besides what we\nwounded that we knew not of, knocked sixteen of them down upon the spot,\nand three more were so lamed, that they fell about twenty or thirty\nyards from them.\n\nAs soon as we had fired, they set up the horridest yell, or howling,\npartly raised by those that were wounded, and partly by those that\npitied and condoled the bodies they saw lie dead, that I never heard\nanything like it before or since.\n\nWe stood stock still after we had fired, to load our guns again, and\nfinding they did not stir from the place we fired among them again; we\nkilled about nine of them at the second fire; but as they did not stand\nso thick as before, all our men did not fire, seven of us being ordered\nto reserve our charge, and to advance as soon as the other had fired,\nwhile the rest loaded again; of which I shall speak again presently.\n\nAs soon as we had fired the second volley, we shouted as loud as we\ncould, and the seven men advanced upon them, and, coming about twenty\nyards nearer, fired again, and those that were behind having loaded\nagain with all expedition, followed; but when they saw us advance, they\nran screaming away as if they were bewitched.\n\nWhen we came up to the field of battle, we saw a great number of bodies\nlying upon the ground, many more than we could suppose were killed or\nwounded; nay, more than we had bullets in our pieces when we fired; and\nwe could not tell what to make of it; but at length we found how it\nwas, viz., that they were frighted out of all manner of sense; nay, I do\nbelieve several of those that were really dead, were frighted to death,\nand had no wound about them.\n\nOf those that were thus frighted, as I have said, several of them, as\nthey recovered themselves, came and worshipped us (taking us for gods or\ndevils, I know not which, nor did it much matter to us): some kneeling,\nsome throwing themselves flat on the ground, made a thousand antic\ngestures, but all with tokens of the most profound submission. It\npresently came into my head, that we might now, by the law of arms, take\nas many prisoners as we would, and make them travel with us, and carry\nour baggage. As soon as I proposed it, our men were all of my mind; and\naccordingly we secured about sixty lusty young fellows, and let them\nknow they must go with us; which they seemed very willing to do. But\nthe next question we had among ourselves, was, how we should do to trust\nthem, for we found the people not like those of Madagascar, but fierce,\nrevengeful, and treacherous; for which reason we were sure that we\nshould have no service from them but that of mere slaves; no subjection\nthat would continue any longer than the fear of us was upon them, nor\nany labour but by violence.\n\nBefore I go any farther, I must hint to the reader, that from this time\nforward I began to enter a little more seriously into the circumstance\nI was in, and concerned myself more in the conduct of our affairs; for\nthough my comrades were all older men, yet I began to find them void of\ncounsel, or, as I now call it, presence of mind, when they came to the\nexecution of a thing. The first occasion I took to observe this, was in\ntheir late engagement with the natives, when, though they had taken a\ngood resolution to attack them and fire upon them, yet, when they had\nfired the first time, and found that the negroes did not run as they\nexpected, their hearts began to fail, and I am persuaded, if their bark\nhad been near hand, they would every man have run away.\n\nUpon this occasion I began to take upon me a little to hearten them\nup, and to call upon them to load again, and give them another volley,\ntelling them that I would engage, if they would be ruled by me, I'd make\nthe negroes run fast enough. I found this heartened them, and therefore,\nwhen they fired a second time, I desired them to reserve some of their\nshot for an attempt by itself, as I mentioned above.\n\nHaving fired a second time, I was indeed forced to command, as I may\ncall it. \"Now, seigniors,\" said I, \"let us give them a cheer.\" So I\nopened my throat, and shouted three times, as our English sailors do on\nlike occasions. \"And now follow me,\" said I to the seven that had not\nfired, \"and I'll warrant you we will make work with them,\" and so it\nproved indeed; for, as soon as they saw us coming, away they ran, as\nabove.\n\nFrom this day forward they would call me nothing but Seignior Capitanio;\nbut I told them I would not be called seignior. \"Well, then,\" said the\ngunner, who spoke good English, \"you shall be called Captain Bob;\" and\nso they gave me my title ever after.\n\nNothing is more certain of the Portuguese than this, take them\nnationally or personally, if they are animated and heartened up by\nanybody to go before, and encourage them by example, they will behave\nwell enough; but if they have nothing but their own measures to follow,\nthey sink immediately: these men had certainly fled from a parcel of\nnaked savages, though even by flying they could not have saved their\nlives, if I had not shouted and hallooed, and rather made sport with the\nthing than a fight, to keep up their courage.\n\nNor was there less need of it upon several occasions hereafter; and I do\nconfess I have often wondered how a number of men, who, when they came\nto the extremity, were so ill supported by their own spirits, had\nat first courage to propose and to undertake the most desperate and\nimpracticable attempt that ever men went about in the world.\n\nThere were indeed two or three indefatigable men among them, by whose\ncourage and industry all the rest were upheld; and indeed those two or\nthree were the managers of them from the beginning; that was the gunner,\nand that cutler whom I call the artist; and the third, who was pretty\nwell, though not like either of them, was one of the carpenters. These\nindeed were the life and soul of all the rest, and it was to their\ncourage that all the rest owed the resolution they showed upon any\noccasion. But when those saw me take a little upon me, as above, they\nembraced me, and treated me with particular affection ever after.\n\nThis gunner was an excellent mathematician, a good scholar, and a\ncomplete sailor; and it was in conversing intimately with him that I\nlearned afterwards the grounds of what knowledge I have since had in all\nthe sciences useful for navigation, and particularly in the geographical\npart of knowledge.\n\nEven in our conversation, finding me eager to understand and learn, he\nlaid the foundation of a general knowledge of things in my mind, gave\nme just ideas of the form of the earth and of the sea, the situation of\ncountries, the course of rivers, the doctrine of the spheres, the motion\nof the stars; and, in a word, taught me a kind of system of astronomy,\nwhich I afterwards improved.\n\nIn an especial manner, he filled my head with aspiring thoughts, and\nwith an earnest desire after learning everything that could be taught\nme; convincing me, that nothing could qualify me for great undertakings,\nbut a degree of learning superior to what was usual in the race of\nseamen; he told me, that to be ignorant was to be certain of a\nmean station in the world, but that knowledge was the first step to\npreferment. He was always flattering me with my capacity to learn; and\nthough that fed my pride, yet, on the other hand, as I had a secret\nambition, which just at that time fed itself in my mind, it prompted in\nme an insatiable thirst after learning in general, and I resolved, if\never I came back to Europe, and had anything left to purchase it, I\nwould make myself master of all the parts of learning needful to\nthe making of me a complete sailor; but I was not so just to myself\nafterwards as to do it when I had an opportunity.\n\nBut to return to our business; the gunner, when he saw the service I\nhad done in the fight, and heard my proposal for keeping a number of\nprisoners for our march, and for carrying our baggage, turns to me\nbefore them all. \"Captain Bob,\" says he, \"I think you must be our\nleader, for all the success of this enterprise is owing to you.\" \"No,\nno,\" said I, \"do not compliment me; you shall be our Seignior Capitanio,\nyou shall be general; I am too young for it.\" So, in short, we all\nagreed he should be our leader; but he would not accept of it alone, but\nwould have me joined with him; and all the rest agreeing, I was obliged\nto comply.\n\nThe first piece of service they put me upon in this new command was\nas difficult as any they could think of, and that was to manage the\nprisoners; which, however, I cheerfully undertook, as you shall hear\npresently. But the immediate consultation was yet of more consequence;\nand that was, first, which way we should go; and secondly, how to\nfurnish ourselves for the voyage with provisions.\n\nThere was among the prisoners one tall, well-shaped, handsome fellow,\nto whom the rest seemed to pay great respect, and who, as we understood\nafterwards, was the son of one of their kings; his father was, it seems,\nkilled at our first volley, and he wounded with a shot in his arm, and\nwith another just on one of his hips or haunches. The shot in his haunch\nbeing in a fleshy part, bled much, and he was half dead with the loss of\nblood. As to the shot in his arm, it had broke his wrist, and he was by\nboth these wounds quite disabled, so that we were once going to turn him\naway, and let him die; and, if we had, he would have died indeed in a\nfew days more: but, as I found the man had some respect showed him, it\npresently occurred to my thoughts that we might bring him to be useful\nto us, and perhaps make him a kind of commander over them. So I caused\nour surgeon to take him in hand, and gave the poor wretch good words,\nthat is to say, I spoke to him as well as I could by signs, to make him\nunderstand that we would make him well again.\n\nThis created a new awe in their minds of us, believing that, as we could\nkill at a distance by something invisible to them (for so our shot was,\nto be sure), so we could make them well again too. Upon this the young\nprince (for so we called him afterwards) called six or seven of the\nsavages to him, and said something to them; what it was we know not, but\nimmediately all the seven came to me, and kneeled down to me, holding up\ntheir hands, and making signs of entreaty, pointing to the place where\none of those lay whom we had killed.\n\nIt was a long time before I or any of us could understand them; but one\nof them ran and lifted up a dead man, pointing to his wound, which was\nin his eyes, for he was shot into the head at one of his eyes. Then\nanother pointed to the surgeon, and at last we found it out, that the\nmeaning was, that he should heal the prince's father too, who was dead,\nbeing shot through the head, as above.\n\nWe presently took the hint, and would not say we could not do it, but\nlet them know, the men that were killed were those that had first fallen\nupon us, and provoked us, and we would by no means make them alive\nagain; and that, if any others did so, we would kill them too, and never\nlet them live any more: but that, if he (the prince) would be willing\nto go with us, and do as we should direct him, we would not let him die,\nand would make his arm well. Upon this he bid his men go and fetch a\nlong stick or staff, and lay on the ground. When they brought it, we saw\nit was an arrow; he took it with his left hand (for his other was lame\nwith the wound), and, pointing up at the sun, broke the arrow in two,\nand set the point against his breast, and then gave it to me. This was,\nas I understood afterwards, wishing the sun, whom they worship, might\nshoot him into the breast with an arrow, if ever he failed to be my\nfriend; and giving the point of the arrow to me was to be a testimony\nthat I was the man he had sworn to: and never was Christian more\npunctual to an oath than he was to this, for he was a sworn servant to\nus for many a weary month after that.\n\nWhen I brought him to the surgeon, he immediately dressed the wound in\nhis haunch or buttock, and found the bullet had only grazed upon the\nflesh, and passed, as it were, by it, but it was not lodged in the part,\nso that it was soon healed and well again; but, as to his arm, he found\none of the bones broken, which are in the fore-part from the wrist to\nthe elbow; and this he set, and splintered it up, and bound his arm in a\nsling, hanging it about his neck, and making signs to him that he should\nnot stir it; which he was so strict an observer of, that he set him\ndown, and never moved one way or other but as the surgeon gave him\nleave.\n\nI took a great deal of pains to acquaint this negro what we intended\nto do, and what use we intended to make of his men; and particularly\nto teach him the meaning of what we said, especially to teach him some\nwords, such as yes and no, and what they meant, and to inure him to\nour way of talking; and he was very willing and apt to learn anything I\ntaught him.\n\nIt was easy to let him see that we intended to carry our provision with\nus from the first day; but he made signs to us to tell us we need not,\nfor we should find provision enough everywhere for forty days. It was\nvery difficult for us to understand how he expressed forty; for he\nknew no figures, but some words that they used to one another that they\nunderstood it by. At last one of the negroes, by his order, laid forty\nlittle stones one by another, to show us how many days we should travel,\nand find provisions sufficient.\n\nThen I showed him our baggage, which was very heavy, particularly our\npowder, shot, lead, iron, carpenters' tools, seamen's instruments, cases\nof bottles, and other lumber. He took some of the things up in his hand\nto feel the weight, and shook his head at them; so I told our people\nthey must resolve to divide their things into small parcels, and make\nthem portable; and accordingly they did so, by which means we were fain\nto leave all our chests behind us, which were eleven in number.\n\nThen he made signs to us that he would procure some buffaloes, or young\nbulls, as I called them, to carry things for us, and made signs, too,\nthat if we were weary, we might be carried too; but that we slighted,\nonly were willing to have the creatures, because, at last, when they\ncould serve us no farther for carriage, we might eat them all up if we\nhad any occasion for them.\n\nI then carried him to our bark, and showed him what things we had here.\nHe seemed amazed at the sight of our bark, having never seen anything\nof that kind before, for their boats are most wretched things, such as\nI never saw before, having no head or stern, and being made only of the\nskins of goats, sewed together with dried guts of goats and sheep, and\ndone over with a kind of slimy stuff like rosin and oil, but of a most\nnauseous, odious smell; and they are poor miserable things for boats,\nthe worst that any part of the world ever saw; a canoe is an excellent\ncontrivance compared to them.\n\nBut to return to our boat. We carried our new prince into it, and helped\nhim over the side, because of his lameness. We made signs to him that\nhis men must carry our goods for us, and showed him what we had; he\nanswered, \"Si, Seignior,\" or, \"Yes, sir\" (for we had taught him that\nword and the meaning of it), and taking up a bundle, he made signs to\nus, that when his arm was well he would carry some for us.\n\nI made signs again to tell him, that if he would make his men carry\nthem, we would not let him carry anything. We had secured all the\nprisoners in a narrow place, where we had bound them with mat cords, and\nset up stakes like a palisado round them; so, when we carried the prince\non shore, we went with him to them, and made signs to him to ask them if\nthey were willing to go with us to the country of lions. Accordingly he\nmade a long speech to them, and we could understand by it that he told\nthem, if they were willing, they must say, \"Si, Seignior,\" telling\nthem what it signified. They immediately answered, \"Si, Seignior,\" and\nclapped their hands, looking up to the sun, which, the prince signified\nto us, was swearing to be faithful. But as soon as they had said so, one\nof them made a long speech to the prince; and in it we perceived, by his\ngestures, which were very antic, that they desired something from us,\nand that they were in great concern about it. So I asked him, as well as\nI could, what it was they desired of us; he told us by signs that they\ndesired we should clap our hands to the sun (that was, to swear) that we\nwould not kill them, that we would give them chiaruck, that is to say,\nbread, would not starve them, and would not let the lions eat them.\nI told him we would promise all that; then he pointed to the sun, and\nclapped his hands, signing to me that I should do so too, which I did;\nat which all the prisoners fell flat on the ground, and rising up again,\nmade the oddest, wildest cries that ever I heard.\n\nI think it was the first time in my life that ever any religious thought\naffected me; but I could not refrain some reflections, and almost tears,\nin considering how happy it was that I was not born among such creatures\nas these, and was not so stupidly ignorant and barbarous; but this soon\nwent off again, and I was not troubled again with any qualms of that\nsort for a long time after.\n\nWhen this ceremony was over, our concern was to get some provisions,\nas well for the present subsistence of our prisoners as ourselves; and\nmaking signs to our prince that we were thinking upon that subject, he\nmade signs to me that, if I would let one of the prisoners go to his\ntown, he should bring provisions, and should bring some beasts to carry\nour baggage. I seemed loth to trust him, and supposing that he would\nrun away, he made great signs of fidelity, and with his own hands tied a\nrope about his neck, offering me one end of it, intimating that I should\nhang him if the man did not come again. So I consented, and he gave him\nabundance of instructions, and sent him away, pointing to the light of\nthe sun, which it seems was to tell him at what time he must be back.\n\nThe fellow ran as if he was mad, and held it till he was quite out of\nsight, by which I supposed he had a great way to go. The next morning,\nabout two hours before the time appointed, the black prince, for so I\nalways called him, beckoning with his hand to me, and hallooing after\nhis manner, desired me to come to him, which I did, when, pointing to a\nlittle hill about two miles off, I saw plainly a little drove of cattle,\nand several people with them; those, he told me by signs, were the man\nhe had sent, and several more with him, and cattle for us.\n\nAccordingly, by the time appointed, he came quite to our huts, and\nbrought with him a great many cows, young runts, about sixteen goats,\nand four young bulls, taught to carry burthens.\n\nThis was a supply of provisions sufficient; as for bread, we were\nobliged to shift with some roots which we had made use of before. We\nthen began to consider of making some large bags like the soldiers'\nknapsacks, for their men to carry our baggage in, and to make it easy\nto them; and the goats being killed, I ordered the skins to be spread\nin the sun, and they were as dry in two days as could be desired; so we\nfound means to make such little bags as we wanted, and began to divide\nour baggage into them. When the black prince found what they were for,\nand how easy they were of carriage when we put them on, he smiled a\nlittle, and sent away the man again to fetch skins, and he brought two\nnatives more with him, all loaded with skins better cured than ours, and\nof other kinds, such as we could not tell what names to give them.\n\nThese two men brought the black prince two lances, of the sort they use\nin their fights, but finer than ordinary, being made of black smooth\nwood, as fine as ebony, and headed at the point with the end of a long\ntooth of some creature--we could not tell of what creature; the head was\nso firm put on, and the tooth so strong, though no bigger than my thumb,\nand sharp at the end, that I never saw anything like it in any place in\nthe world.\n\nThe prince would not take them till I gave him leave, but made signs\nthat they should give them to me; however, I gave him leave to take them\nhimself, for I saw evident signs of an honourable just principle in him.\n\nWe now prepared for our march, when the prince coming to me, and\npointing towards the several quarters of the world, made signs to know\nwhich way we intended to go; and when I showed him, pointing to the\nwest, he presently let me know there was a great river a little further\nto the north, which was able to carry our bark many leagues into the\ncountry due west. I presently took the hint, and inquired for the mouth\nof the river, which I understood by him was above a day's march, and, by\nour estimation, we found it about seven leagues further. I take this to\nbe the great river marked by our chart-makers at the northmost part of\nthe coast of Mozambique, and called there Quilloa.\n\nConsulting thus with ourselves, we resolved to take the prince, and as\nmany of the prisoners as we could stow in our frigate, and go about\nby the bay into the river; and that eight of us, with our arms, should\nmarch by land to meet them on the river side; for the prince, carrying\nus to a rising ground, had showed us the river very plain, a great way\nup the country, and in one place it was not above six miles to it.\n\nIt was my lot to march by land, and be captain of the whole caravan.\nI had eight of our men with me, and seven-and-thirty of our prisoners,\nwithout any baggage, for all our luggage was yet on board. We drove the\nyoung bulls with us; nothing was ever so tame, so willing to work, or\ncarry anything. The negroes would ride upon them four at a time, and\nthey would go very willingly. They would eat out of our hand, lick our\nfeet, and were as tractable as a dog.\n\nWe drove with us six or seven cows for food; but our negroes knew\nnothing of curing the flesh by salting and drying it till we showed them\nthe way, and then they were mighty willing to do so as long as we had\nany salt to do it with, and to carry salt a great way too, after we\nfound we should have no more.\n\nIt was an easy march to the river side for us that went by land, and\nwe came thither in a piece of a day, being, as above, no more than six\nEnglish miles; whereas it was no less than five days before they came\nto us by water, the wind in the bay having failed them, and the way, by\nreason of a great turn or reach in the river, being about fifty miles\nabout.\n\nWe spent this time in a thing which the two strangers, which brought the\nprince the two lances, put into the head of the prisoners, viz., to make\nbottles of the goats' skins to carry fresh water in, which it seems they\nknew we should come to want; and the men did it so dexterously, having\ndried skins fetched them by those two men, that before our vessel came\nup, they had every man a pouch like a bladder, to carry fresh water in,\nhanging over their shoulders by a thong made of other skins, about three\ninches broad, like the sling of a fuzee.\n\nOur prince, to assure us of the fidelity of the men in this march,\nhad ordered them to be tied two and two by the wrist, as we handcuff\nprisoners in England; and made them so sensible of the reasonableness of\nit, that he made them do it themselves, appointing four of them to bind\nthe rest; but we found them so honest, and particularly so obedient\nto him, that after we were gotten a little further off of their own\ncountry, we set them at liberty, though, when he came to us, he would\nhave them tied again, and they continued so a good while.\n\nAll the country on the bank of the river was a high land, no marshy\nswampy ground in it; the verdure good, and abundance of cattle feeding\nupon it wherever we went, or which way soever we looked; there was\nnot much wood indeed, at least not near us; but further up we saw oak,\ncedar, and pine-trees, some of which were very large.\n\nThe river was a fair open channel, about as broad as the Thames below\nGravesend, and a strong tide of flood, which we found held us about\nsixty miles; the channel deep, nor did we find any want of water for a\ngreat way. In short, we went merrily up the river with the flood and\nthe wind blowing still fresh at E. and E.N.E. We stemmed the ebb easily\nalso, especially while the river continued broad and deep; but when we\ncame past the swelling of the tide, and had the natural current of the\nriver to go against, we found it too strong for us, and began to think\nof quitting our bark; but the prince would by no means agree to that,\nfor, finding we had on board pretty good store of roping made of mats\nand flags, which I described before, he ordered all the prisoners which\nwere on shore to come and take hold of those ropes, and tow us along by\nthe shore side; and as we hoisted our sail too, to ease them, the men\nran along with us at a very great rate.\n\nIn this manner the river carried us up, by our computation, near 200\nmiles, and then it narrowed apace, and was not above as broad as the\nThames is at Windsor, or thereabouts; and, after another day, we came\nto a great waterfall or cataract, enough to fright us, for I believe the\nwhole body of water fell at once perpendicularly down a precipice\nabove sixty foot high, which made noise enough to deprive men of their\nhearing, and we heard it above ten miles before we came to it.\n\nHere we were at a full stop, and now our prisoners went first on shore;\nthey had worked very hard and very cheerfully, relieving one another,\nthose that were weary being taken into the bark. Had we had canoes or\nany boats which might have been carried by men's strength we might have\ngone two hundred miles more up this river in small boats, but our great\nboat could go no farther.\n\nAll this way the country looked green and pleasant, and was full of\ncattle, and some people we saw, though not many; but this we observed\nnow, that the people did no more understand our prisoners here than\nwe could understand them; being, it seems, of different nations and of\ndifferent speech. We had yet seen no wild beasts, or, at least, none\nthat came very near us, except two days before we came to the waterfall,\nwhen we saw three of the most beautiful leopards that ever were seen,\nstanding upon the bank of the river on the north side, our prisoners\nbeing all on the other side of the water. Our gunner espied them first,\nand ran to fetch his gun, putting a ball extraordinary in it; and coming\nto me, \"Now, Captain Bob,\" says he, \"where is your prince?\" So I called\nhim out. \"Now,\" says he, \"tell your men not to be afraid; tell them they\nshall see that thing in his hand speak in fire to one of those beasts,\nand make it kill itself.\"\n\nThe poor negroes looked as if they had been all going to be killed,\nnotwithstanding what their prince said to them, and stood staring to\nexpect the issue, when on a sudden the gunner fired; and as he was a\nvery good marksman, he shot the creature with two slugs, just in the\nhead. As soon as the leopard felt herself struck, she reared up on her\ntwo hind-legs, bolt upright, and throwing her forepaws about in the air,\nfell backward, growling and struggling, and immediately died; the other\ntwo, frighted with the fire and the noise, fled, and were out of sight\nin an instant.\n\nBut the two frighted leopards were not in half the consternation that\nour prisoners were; four or five of them fell down as if they had been\nshot; several others fell on their knees, and lifted up their hands to\nus; whether to worship us, or pray us not to kill them, we did not know;\nbut we made signs to their prince to encourage them, which he did, but\nit was with much ado that he brought them to their senses. Nay, the\nprince, notwithstanding all that was said to prepare him for it, yet\nwhen the piece went off, he gave a start as if he would have leaped into\nthe river.\n\nWhen we saw the creature killed, I had a great mind to have the skin of\nher, and made signs to the prince that he should send some of his men\nover to take the skin off. As soon as he spoke but a word, four of them,\nthat offered themselves, were untied, and immediately they jumped into\nthe river, and swam over, and went to work with him. The prince having a\nknife that we gave him, made four wooden knives so clever, that I never\nsaw anything like them in my life; and in less than an hour's time they\nbrought me the skin of the leopard, which was a monstrous great one, for\nit was from the ears to the tale about seven foot, and near five foot\nbroad on the back, and most admirably spotted all over. The skin of this\nleopard I brought to London many years after.\n\nWe were now all upon a level as to our travelling, being unshipped, for\nour bark would swim no farther, and she was too heavy to carry on our\nbacks; but as we found the course of the river went a great way farther,\nwe consulted our carpenters whether we could not pull the bark in\npieces, and make us three or four small boats to go on with. They told\nus we might do so, but it would be very long a-doing; and that, when\nwe had done, we had neither pitch or tar to make them sound to keep the\nwater out, or nails to fasten the plank. But one of them told us that as\nsoon as he could come at any large tree near the river, he would make\nus a canoe or two in a quarter of the time, and which would serve us\nas well for all the uses we could have any occasion for as a boat; and\nsuch, that if we came to any waterfalls, we might take them up, and\ncarry them for a mile or two by land upon our shoulders.\n\nUpon this we gave over the thoughts of our frigate, and hauling her into\na little cove or inlet, where a small brook came into the main river,\nwe laid her up for those that came next, and marched forward. We spent\nindeed two days dividing our baggage, and loading our tame buffaloes\nand our negroes. Our powder and shot, which was the thing we were most\ncareful of, we ordered thus:--First, the powder we divided into little\nleather bags, that is to say, bags of dried skins, with the hair inward,\nthat the powder might not grow damp; and then we put those bags into\nother bags, made of bullocks' skins, very thick and hard, with the hair\noutward, that no wet might come in; and this succeeded so well, that in\nthe greatest rains we had, whereof some were very violent and very long,\nwe always kept our powder dry. Besides these bags, which held our chief\nmagazine, we divided to every one a quarter of a pound of powder, and\nhalf a pound of shot, to carry always about us; which, as it was enough\nfor our present use, so we were willing to have no weight to carry more\nthan was absolutely necessary, because of the heat.\n\nWe kept still on the bank of the river, and for that reason had but very\nlittle communication with the people of the country; for, having also\nour bark stored with plenty of provisions, we had no occasion to look\nabroad for a supply; but now, when we came to march on foot, we were\nobliged often to seek out for food. The first place we came to on the\nriver, that gave us any stop, was a little negro town, containing about\nfifty huts, and there appeared about 400 people, for they all came out\nto see us, and wonder at us. When our negroes appeared the inhabitants\nbegan to fly to arms, thinking there had been enemies coming upon them;\nbut our negroes, though they could not speak their language, made signs\nto them that they had no weapons, and were tied two and two together as\ncaptives, and that there were people behind who came from the sun, and\nthat could kill them all, and make them alive again, if they pleased;\nbut that they would do them no hurt, and came with peace. As soon as\nthey understood this they laid down their lances, and bows and arrows,\nand came and stuck twelve large stakes in the ground as a token of\npeace, bowing themselves to us in token of submission. But as soon as\nthey saw white men with beards, that is to say, with mustachios, they\nran screaming away, as in a fright.\n\nWe kept at a distance from them, not to be too familiar; and when we did\nappear it was but two or three of us at a time. But our prisoners\nmade them understand that we required some provisions of them; so\nthey brought us some black cattle, for they have abundance of cows and\nbuffaloes all over that side of the country, as also great numbers of\ndeer. Our cutler, who had now a great stock of things of his handiwork,\ngave them some little knick-knacks, as plates of silver and of iron,\ncut diamond fashion, and cut into hearts and into rings, and they were\nmightily pleased. They also brought several fruits and roots, which we\ndid not understand, but our negroes fed heartily on them, and after we\nhad seen them eat them, we did so too.\n\nHaving stocked ourselves here with flesh and root as much as we could\nwell carry, we divided the burthens among our negroes, appointing about\nthirty to forty pounds weight to a man, which we thought indeed was load\nenough in a hot country; and the negroes did not at all repine at it,\nbut would sometimes help one another when they began to be weary, which\ndid happen now and then, though not often; besides, as most of their\nluggage was our provision, it lightened every day, like Aesop's basket\nof bread, till we came to get a recruit.--Note, when we loaded them we\nuntied their hands, and tied them two and two together by one foot.\n\nThe third day of our march from this place our chief carpenter desired\nus to halt, and set up some huts, for he had found out some trees that\nhe liked, and resolved to make us some canoes; for, as he told me, he\nknew we should have marching enough on foot after we left the river, and\nhe was resolved to go no farther by land than needs must.\n\nWe had no sooner given orders for our little camp, and given leave to\nour negroes to lay down their loads, but they fell to work to build our\nhuts; and though they were tied as above, yet they did it so nimbly as\nsurprised us. Here we set some of the negroes quite at liberty, that is\nto say, without tying them, having the prince's word passed for their\nfidelity; and some of these were ordered to help the carpenters, which\nthey did very handily, with a little direction, and others were sent\nto see whether they could get any provisions near hand; but instead of\nprovisions, three of them came in with two bows and arrows, and five\nlances. They could not easily make us understand how they came by them,\nonly that they had surprised some negro women, who were in some huts,\nthe men being from home, and they had found the lances and bows in the\nhuts, or houses, the women and children flying away at the sight of\nthem, as from robbers. We seemed very angry at them, and made the prince\nask them if they had not killed any of the women or children, making\nthem believe that, if they had killed anybody, we would make them kill\nthemselves too; but they protested their innocence, so we excused them.\nThen they brought us the bows and arrows and lances; but, at a motion of\ntheir black prince, we gave them back the bows and arrows, and gave them\nleave to go out to see what they could kill for food; and here we gave\nthem the laws of arms, viz., that if any man appeared to assault them,\nor shoot at them to offer any violence to them, they might kill them;\nbut that they should not offer to kill or hurt any that offered them\npeace, or laid down their weapons, nor any women or children, upon any\noccasion whatsoever. These were our articles of war.\n\nThese two fellows had not been gone out above three or four hours, but\none of them came running to us without his bow and arrows, hallooing and\nwhooping a great while before he came at us, \"Okoamo, okoamo!\" which,\nit seems, was, \"Help, help!\" The rest of the negroes rose up in a hurry,\nand by twos, as they could, ran forward towards their fellows, to know\nwhat the matter was. As for me, I did not understand it, nor any of our\npeople; the prince looked as if something unlucky had fallen out, and\nsome of our men took up their arms to be ready on occasion. But the\nnegroes soon discovered the thing, for we saw four of them presently\nafter coming along with a great load of meat upon their backs. The case\nwas, that the two who went out with their bows and arrows, meeting with\na great herd of deer in the plain, had been so nimble as to shoot three\nof them, and then one of them came running to us for help to fetch them\naway. This was the first venison we had met with in all our march, and\nwe feasted upon it very plentifully; and this was the first time we\nbegan to prevail with our prince to eat his meat dressed our way; after\nwhich his men were prevailed with by his example, but before that, they\nate most of the flesh they had quite raw.\n\nWe wished now we had brought some bows and arrows out with us, which we\nmight have done; and we began to have so much confidence in our negroes,\nand to be so familiar with them, that we oftentimes let them go, or the\ngreatest part of them, untied, being well assured they would not leave\nus, and that they did not know what course to take without us; but one\nthing we resolved not to trust them with, and that was the charging our\nguns: but they always believed our guns had some heavenly power in them,\nthat would send forth fire and smoke, and speak with a dreadful noise,\nand kill at a distance whenever we bid them.\n\nIn about eight days we finished three canoes, and in them we embarked\nour white men and our baggage, with our prince, and some of the\nprisoners. We also found it needful to keep some of ourselves always on\nshore, not only to manage the negroes, but to defend them from enemies\nand wild beasts. Abundance of little incidents happened upon this march,\nwhich it is impossible to crowd into this account; particularly, we\nsaw more wild beasts now than we did before, some elephants, and two or\nthree lions, none of which kinds we had seen any of before; and we\nfound our negroes were more afraid of them a great deal than we were;\nprincipally, because they had no bows and arrows, or lances, which were\nthe particular weapons they were bred up to the exercise of.\n\nBut we cured them of their fears by being always ready with our\nfirearms. However, as we were willing to be sparing of our powder, and\nthe killing of any of the creatures now was no advantage to us, seeing\ntheir skins were too heavy for us to carry, and their flesh not good to\neat, we resolved therefore to keep some of our pieces uncharged and only\nprimed; and causing them to flash in the pan, the beasts, even the\nlions themselves, would always start and fly back when they saw it, and\nimmediately march off.\n\nWe passed abundance of inhabitants upon this upper part of the river,\nand with this observation, that almost every ten miles we came to a\nseparate nation, and every separate nation had a different speech,\nor else their speech had differing dialects, so that they did not\nunderstand one another. They all abounded in cattle, especially on the\nriver-side; and the eighth day of this second navigation we met with\na little negro town, where they had growing a sort of corn like rice,\nwhich ate very sweet; and, as we got some of it of the people, we made\nvery good cakes of bread of it, and, making a fire, baked them on the\nground, after the fire was swept away, very well; so that hitherto we\nhad no want of provisions of any kind that we could desire.\n\nOur negroes towing our canoes, we travelled at a considerable rate, and\nby our own account could not go less than twenty or twenty-five English\nmiles a day, and the river continuing to be much of the same breadth\nand very deep all the way, till on the tenth day we came to another\ncataract; for a ridge of high hills crossing the whole channel of the\nriver, the water came tumbling down the rocks from one stage to another\nin a strange manner, so that it was a continued link of cataracts from\none to another, in the manner of a cascade, only that the falls were\nsometimes a quarter of a mile from one another, and the noise confused\nand frightful.\n\nWe thought our voyaging was at a full stop now; but three of us, with\na couple of our negroes, mounting the hills another way, to view the\ncourse of the river, we found a fair channel again after about half a\nmile's march, and that it was like to hold us a good way further. So\nwe set all hands to work, unloaded our cargo, and hauled our canoes on\nshore, to see if we could carry them.\n\nUpon examination we found that they were very heavy; but our carpenters,\nspending but one day's work upon them, hewed away so much of the timber\nfrom their outsides as reduced them very much, and yet they were as fit\nto swim as before. When this was done, ten men with poles took up one\nof the canoes and made nothing to carry it. So we ordered twenty men to\neach canoe, that one ten might relieve the other; and thus we carried\nall our canoes, and launched them into the water again, and then fetched\nour luggage and loaded it all again into the canoes, and all in an\nafternoon; and the next morning early we moved forward again. When we\nhad towed about four days more, our gunner, who was our pilot, began to\nobserve that we did not keep our right course so exactly as we ought,\nthe river winding away a little towards the north, and gave us notice\nof it accordingly. However, we were not willing to lose the advantage of\nwater-carriage, at least not till we were forced to it; so we jogged on,\nand the river served us for about threescore miles further; but then\nwe found it grew very small and shallow, having passed the mouths of\nseveral little brooks or rivulets which came into it; and at length it\nbecame but a brook itself.\n\nWe towed up as far as ever our boats would swim, and we went two days\nthe farther--having been about twelve days in this last part of the\nriver--by lightening the boats and taking our luggage out, which we made\nthe negroes carry, being willing to ease ourselves as long as we could;\nbut at the end of these two days, in short, there was not water enough\nto swim a London wherry.\n\nWe now set forward wholly by land, and without any expectation of more\nwater-carriage. All our concern for more water was to be sure to have a\nsupply for our drinking; and therefore upon every hill that we came near\nwe clambered up to the highest part to see the country before us, and\nto make the best judgment we could which way to go to keep the lowest\ngrounds, and as near some stream of water as we could.\n\nThe country held verdant, well grown with trees, and spread with rivers\nand brooks, and tolerably well with inhabitants, for about thirty days'\nmarch after our leaving the canoes, during which time things went pretty\nwell with us; we did not tie ourselves down when to march and when to\nhalt, but ordered those things as our convenience and the health and\nease of our people, as well our servants as ourselves, required.\n\nAbout the middle of this march we came into a low and plain country,\nin which we perceived a greater number of inhabitants than in any other\ncountry we had gone through; but that which was worse for us, we found\nthem a fierce, barbarous, treacherous people, and who at first looked\nupon us as robbers, and gathered themselves in numbers to attack us.\n\nOur men were terrified at them at first, and began to discover an\nunusual fear, and even our black prince seemed in a great deal of\nconfusion; but I smiled at him, and showing him some of our guns, I\nasked him if he thought that which killed the spotted cat (for so they\ncalled the leopard in their language) could not make a thousand of those\nnaked creatures die at one blow? Then he laughed, and said, yes, he\nbelieved it would. \"Well, then,\" said I, \"tell your men not to be afraid\nof these people, for we shall soon give them a taste of what we can do\nif they pretend to meddle with us.\" However, we considered we were in\nthe middle of a vast country, and we knew not what numbers of people\nand nations we might be surrounded with, and, above all, we knew not how\nmuch we might stand in need of the friendship of these that we were now\namong, so that we ordered the negroes to try all the methods they could\nto make them friends.\n\nAccordingly the two men who had gotten bows and arrows, and two more\nto whom we gave the prince's two fine lances, went foremost, with five\nmore, having long poles in their hands; and after them ten of our men\nadvanced toward the negro town that was next to us, and we all stood\nready to succour them if there should be occasion.\n\nWhen they came pretty near their houses our negroes hallooed in their\nscreaming way, and called to them as loud as they could. Upon their\ncalling, some of the men came out and answered, and immediately after\nthe whole town, men, women, and children, appeared; our negroes, with\ntheir long poles, went forward a little, and stuck them all in the\nground, and left them, which in their country was a signal of peace, but\nthe other did not understand the meaning of that. Then the two men with\nbows laid down their bows and arrows, went forward unarmed, and made\nsigns of peace to them, which at last the other began to understand; so\ntwo of their men laid down their bows and arrows, and came towards them.\nOur men made all the signs of friendship to them that they could think\nof, putting their hands up to their mouths as a sign that they wanted\nprovisions to eat; and the other pretended to be pleased and friendly,\nand went back to their fellows and talked with them a while, and they\ncame forward again, and made signs that they would bring some provisions\nto them before the sun set; and so our men came back again very well\nsatisfied for that time.\n\nBut an hour before sunset our men went to them again, just in the same\nposture as before, and they came according to their appointment, and\nbrought deer's flesh, roots, and the same kind of corn, like rice, which\nI mentioned above; and our negroes, being furnished with such toys as\nour cutler had contrived, gave them some of them, which they seemed\ninfinitely pleased with, and promised to bring more provisions the next\nday.\n\nAccordingly the next day they came again, but our men perceived they\nwere more in number by a great many than before. However, having sent\nout ten men with firearms to stand ready, and our whole army being in\nview also, we were not much surprised; nor was the treachery of the\nenemy so cunningly ordered as in other cases, for they might have\nsurrounded our negroes, which were but nine, under a show of peace; but\nwhen they saw our men advance almost as far as the place where they were\nthe day before, the rogues snatched up their bows and arrows and came\nrunning upon our men like so many furies, at which our ten men called\nto the negroes to come back to them, which they did with speed enough\nat the first word, and stood all behind our men. As they fled, the other\nadvanced, and let fly near a hundred of their arrows at them, by which\ntwo of our negroes were wounded, and one we thought had been killed.\nWhen they came to the five poles that our men had stuck in the ground,\nthey stood still awhile, and gathering about the poles, looked at them,\nand handled them, as wondering what they meant. We then, who were drawn\nup behind all, sent one of our number to our ten men to bid them fire\namong them while they stood so thick, and to put some small shot into\ntheir guns besides the ordinary charge, and to tell them that we would\nbe up with them immediately.\n\nAccordingly they made ready; but by the time they were ready to fire,\nthe black army had left their wandering about the poles, and began to\nstir as if they would come on, though seeing more men stand at some\ndistance behind our negroes, they could not tell what to make of us;\nbut if they did not understand us before, they understood us less\nafterwards, for as soon as ever our men found them to begin to move\nforward they fired among the thickest of them, being about the distance\nof 120 yards, as near as we could guess.\n\nIt is impossible to express the fright, the screaming and yelling\nof those wretches upon this first volley. We killed six of them, and\nwounded eleven or twelve, I mean as we knew of; for, as they stood\nthick, and the small shot, as we called it, scattered among them, we had\nreason to believe we wounded more that stood farther off, for our small\nshot was made of bits of lead and bits of iron, heads of nails, and such\nthings as our diligent artificer, the cutler, helped us to.\n\nAs to those that were killed and wounded, the other frighted creatures\nwere under the greatest amazement in the world, to think what should\nhurt them, for they could see nothing but holes made in their bodies\nthey knew not how. Then the fire and noise amazed all their women and\nchildren, and frighted them out of their wits, so that they ran staring\nand howling about like mad creatures.\n\nHowever, all this did not make them fly, which was what we wanted, nor\ndid we find any of them die as it were with fear, as at first; so we\nresolved upon a second volley, and then to advance as we did before.\nWhereupon our reserved men advancing, we resolved to fire only three men\nat a time, and move forward like an army firing in platoon; so, being\nall in a line, we fired, first three on the right, then three on the\nleft, and so on; and every time we killed or wounded some of them, but\nstill they did not fly, and yet they were so frighted that they used\nnone of their bows and arrows, or of their lances; and we thought their\nnumbers increased upon our hands, particularly we thought so by the\nnoise. So I called to our men to halt, and bid them pour in one whole\nvolley and then shout, as we did in our first fight, and so run in upon\nthem and knock them down with our muskets.\n\nBut they were too wise for that too, for as soon as we had fired a whole\nvolley and shouted, they all ran away, men, women, and children, so fast\nthat in a few moments we could not see one creature of them except some\nthat were wounded and lame, who lay wallowing and screaming here and\nthere upon the ground as they happened to fall.\n\nUpon this we came up to the field of battle, where we found we had\nkilled thirty-seven of them, among which were three women, and had\nwounded about sixty-four, among which were two women; by wounded I\nmean such as were so maimed as not to be able to go away, and those our\nnegroes killed afterwards in a cowardly manner in cold blood, for which\nwe were very angry, and threatened to make them go to them if they did\nso again.\n\nThere was no great spoil to be got, for they were all stark naked as\nthey came into the world, men and women together, some of them having\nfeathers stuck in their hair, and others a kind of bracelet about their\nnecks, but nothing else; but our negroes got a booty here, which we were\nvery glad of, and this was the bows and arrows of the vanquished, of\nwhich they found more than they knew what to do with, belonging to the\nkilled and wounded men; these we ordered them to pick up, and they\nwere very useful to us afterwards. After the fight, and our negroes had\ngotten bows and arrows, we sent them out in parties to see what they\ncould get, and they got some provisions; but, which was better than all\nthe rest, they brought us four more young bulls, or buffaloes, that\nhad been brought up to labour and to carry burthens. They knew them, it\nseems, by the burthens they had carried having galled their backs, for\nthey have no saddles to cover them with in that country.\n\nThose creatures not only eased our negroes, but gave us an opportunity\nto carry more provisions; and our negroes loaded them very hard at this\nplace with flesh and roots, such as we wanted very much afterwards.\n\nIn this town we found a very little young leopard, about two spans high;\nit was exceeding tame, and purred like a cat when we stroked it with our\nhands, being, as I suppose, bred up among the negroes like a house-dog.\nIt was our black prince, it seems, who, making his tour among the\nabandoned houses or huts, found this creature there, and making much of\nhim, and giving a bit or two of flesh to him, the creature followed him\nlike a dog; of which more hereafter.\n\nAmong the negroes that were killed in this battle there was one who had\na little thin bit or plate of gold, about as big as a sixpence, which\nhung by a little bit of a twisted gut upon his forehead, by which we\nsupposed he was a man of some eminence among them; but that was not all,\nfor this bit of gold put us upon searching very narrowly if there was\nnot more of it to be had thereabouts, but we found none at all.\n\nFrom this part of the country we went on for about fifteen days, and\nthen found ourselves obliged to march up a high ridge of mountains,\nfrightful to behold, and the first of the kind that we met with; and\nhaving no guide but our little pocket-compass, we had no advantage of\ninformation as to which was the best or the worst way, but was obliged\nto choose by what we saw, and shift as well as we could. We met with\nseveral nations of wild and naked people in the plain country before we\ncame to those hills, and we found them much more tractable and friendly\nthan those devils we had been forced to fight with; and though we could\nlearn little from these people, yet we understood by the signs they made\nthat there was a vast desert beyond these hills, and, as our negroes\ncalled them, much lion, much spotted cat (so they called the leopard);\nand they signed to us also that we must carry water with us. At the last\nof these nations we furnished ourselves with as much provisions as we\ncould possibly carry, not knowing what we had to suffer, or what length\nwe had to go; and, to make our way as familiar to us as possible, I\nproposed that of the last inhabitants we could find we should make some\nprisoners and carry them with us for guides over the desert, and to\nassist us in carrying provision, and, perhaps, in getting it too. The\nadvice was too necessary to be slighted; so finding, by our dumb signs\nto the inhabitants, that there were some people that dwelt at the foot\nof the mountains on the other side before we came to the desert itself,\nwe resolved to furnish ourselves with guides by fair means or foul.\n\nHere, by a moderate computation, we concluded ourselves 700 miles from\nthe sea-coast where we began. Our black prince was this day set free\nfrom the sling his arm hung in, our surgeon having perfectly restored\nit, and he showed it to his own countrymen quite well, which made them\ngreatly wonder. Also our two negroes began to recover, and their wounds\nto heal apace, for our surgeon was very skilful in managing their cure.\n\nHaving with infinite labour mounted these hills, and coming to a view\nof the country beyond them, it was indeed enough to astonish as stout a\nheart as ever was created. It was a vast howling wilderness--not a tree,\na river, or a green thing to be seen; for, as far as the eye could look,\nnothing but a scalding sand, which, as the wind blew, drove about in\nclouds enough to overwhelm man and beast. Nor could we see any end of\nit either before us, which was our way, or to the right hand or left;\nso that truly our men began to be discouraged, and talk of going back\nagain. Nor could we indeed think of venturing over such a horrid place\nas that before us, in which we saw nothing but present death.\n\nI was as much affected at the sight as any of them; but, for all that,\nI could not bear the thoughts of going back again. I told them we had\nmarched 700 miles of our way, and it would be worse than death to\nthink of going back again; and that, if they thought the desert was not\npassable, I thought we should rather change our course, and travel south\ntill we came to the Cape of Good Hope, or north to the country that lay\nalong the Nile, where, perhaps, we might find some way or other over to\nthe west sea; for sure all Africa was not a desert.\n\nOur gunner, who, as I said before, was our guide as to the situation\nof places, told us that he could not tell what to say to going for the\nCape, for it was a monstrous length, being from the place where we now\nwere not less than 1500 miles; and, by his account, we were now come a\nthird part of the way to the coast of Angola, where we should meet the\nwestern ocean, and find ways enough for our escape home. On the other\nhand, he assured us, and showed us a map of it, that, if we went\nnorthward, the western shore of Africa went out into the sea above\n1000 miles west, so that we should have so much and more land to travel\nafterwards; which land might, for aught we knew, be as wild, barren,\nand desert as this. And therefore, upon the whole, he proposed that we\nshould attempt this desert, and perhaps we should not find it so long\nas we feared; and however, he proposed that we should see how far our\nprovisions would carry us, and, in particular, our water; and we should\nventure no further than half so far as our water would last; and if we\nfound no end of the desert, we might come safely back again.\n\nThis advice was so reasonable that we all approved of it; and\naccordingly we calculated that we were able to carry provisions for\nforty-two days, but that we could not carry water for above twenty days,\nthough we were to suppose it to stink, too, before that time expired.\nSo that we concluded that, if we did not come at some water in ten days'\ntime, we would return; but if we found a supply of water, we could then\ntravel twenty-one days; and, if we saw no end of the wilderness in that\ntime, we would return also.\n\nWith this regulation of our measures, we descended the mountains, and it\nwas the second day before we quite reached the plain; where, however,\nto make us amends, we found a fine little rivulet of very good water,\nabundance of deer, a sort of creature like a hare, but not so nimble,\nbut whose flesh we found very agreeable. But we were deceived in our\nintelligence, for we found no people; so we got no more prisoners to\nassist us in carrying our baggage.\n\nThe infinite number of deer and other creatures which we saw here, we\nfound was occasioned by the neighbourhood of the waste or desert, from\nwhence they retired hither for food and refreshment. We stored ourselves\nhere with flesh and roots of divers kinds, which our negroes understood\nbetter than we, and which served us for bread; and with as much water as\n(by the allowance of a quart a day to a man for our negroes, and three\npints a day a man for ourselves, and three quarts a day each for our\nbuffaloes) would serve us twenty days; and thus loaded for a long\nmiserable march, we set forwards, being all sound in health and very\ncheerful, but not alike strong for so great a fatigue; and, which was\nour grievance, were without a guide.\n\nIn the very first entrance of the waste we were exceedingly discouraged,\nfor we found the sand so deep, and it scalded our feet so much with\nthe heat, that after we had, as I may call it, waded rather than walked\nthrough it about seven or eight miles, we were all heartily tired and\nfaint; even the very negroes laid down and panted like creatures that\nhad been pushed beyond their strength.\n\nHere we found the difference of lodging greatly injurious to us; for, as\nbefore, we always made us huts to sleep under, which covered us from the\nnight air, which is particularly unwholesome in those hot countries. But\nwe had here no shelter, no lodging, after so hard a march; for here were\nno trees, no, not a shrub near us; and, which was still more frightful,\ntowards night we began to hear the wolves howl, the lions bellow, and\na great many wild asses braying, and other ugly noises which we did not\nunderstand.\n\nUpon this we reflected upon our indiscretion, that we had not, at least,\nbrought poles or stakes in our hands, with which we might have, as it\nwere, palisadoed ourselves in for the night, and so we might have slept\nsecure, whatever other inconveniences we suffered. However, we found\na way at last to relieve ourselves a little; for first we set up the\nlances and bows we had, and endeavoured to bring the tops of them as\nnear to one another as we could, and so hung our coats on the top of\nthem, which made us a kind of sorry tent. The leopard's skin, and a few\nother skins we had put together, made us a tolerable covering, and thus\nwe laid down to sleep, and slept very heartily too, for the first night;\nsetting, however, a good watch, being two of our own men with their\nfuzees, whom we relieved in an hour at first, and two hours afterwards.\nAnd it was very well we did this, for they found the wilderness swarmed\nwith raging creatures of all kinds, some of which came directly up to\nthe very enclosure of our tent. But our sentinels were ordered not to\nalarm us with firing in the night, but to flash in the pan at them,\nwhich they did, and found it effectual, for the creatures went off\nalways as soon as they saw it, perhaps with some noise or howling, and\npursued such other game as they were upon.\n\nIf we were tired with the day's travel, we were all as much tired with\nthe night's lodging. But our black prince told us in the morning he\nwould give us some counsel, and indeed it was very good counsel. He told\nus we should be all killed if we went on this journey, and through this\ndesert, without some covering for us at night; so he advised us to march\nback again to a little river-side where we lay the night before, and\nstay there till we could make us houses, as he called them, to carry\nwith us to lodge in every night. As he began a little to understand our\nspeech, and we very well to understand his signs, we easily knew what he\nmeant, and that we should there make mats (for we remembered that we saw\na great deal of matting or bass there, that the natives make mats of)--I\nsay, that we should make large mats there for covering our huts or tents\nto lodge in at night.\n\nWe all approved this advice, and immediately resolved to go back that\none day's journey, resolving, though we carried less provisions, we\nwould carry mats with us to cover us in the night. Some of the nimblest\nof us got back to the river with more ease than we had travelled it the\nday before; but, as we were not in haste, the rest made a halt, encamped\nanother night, and came to us the next day.\n\nIn our return of this day's journey, our men that made two days of\nit met with a very surprising thing, that gave them some reason to be\ncareful how they parted company again. The case was this:--The second\nday in the morning, before they had gone half a mile, looking behind\nthem they saw a vast cloud of sand or dust rise in the air, as we see\nsometimes in the roads in summer when it is very dusty and a large drove\nof cattle are coming, only very much greater; and they could easily\nperceive that it came after them; and it came on faster as they went\nfrom it. The cloud of sand was so great that they could not see what it\nwas that raised it, and concluded that it was some army of enemies\nthat pursued them; but then considering that they came from the vast\nuninhabited wilderness, they knew it was impossible any nation or people\nthat way should have intelligence of them or the way of their march;\nand therefore, if it was an army, it must be of such as they were,\ntravelling that way by accident. On the other hand, as they knew that\nthere were no horses in the country, and that they came on so fast, they\nconcluded that it must be some vast collection of wild beasts, perhaps\nmaking to the hill country for food or water, and that they should be\nall devoured or trampled under foot by their multitude.\n\nUpon this thought, they very prudently observed which way the cloud\nseemed to point, and they turned a little out of their way to the north,\nsupposing it might pass by them. When they were about a quarter of a\nmile, they halted to see what it might be. One of the negroes, a nimbler\nfellow than the rest, went back a little, and came in a few minutes\nrunning as fast as the heavy sands would allow, and by signs gave them\nto know that it was a great herd, or drove, or whatever it might be\ncalled, of vast monstrous elephants.\n\nAs it was a sight our men had never seen, they were desirous to see it,\nand yet a little uneasy at the danger too; for though an elephant is a\nheavy unwieldy creature, yet in the deep sand, which is nothing at all\nto them, they marched at a great rate, and would soon have tired our\npeople, if they had had far to go, and had been pursued by them.\n\nOur gunner was with them, and had a great mind to have gone close up to\none of the outermost of them, and to have clapped his piece to his\near, and to have fired into him, because he had been told no shot would\npenetrate them; but they all dissuaded him, lest upon the noise they\nshould all turn upon and pursue us; so he was reasoned out of it, and\nlet them pass, which, in our people's circumstances, was certainly the\nright way.\n\nThey were between twenty and thirty in number, but prodigious great\nones; and though they often showed our men that they saw them, yet they\ndid not turn out of their way, or take any other notice of them than, as\nwe might say, just to look at them. We that were before saw the cloud of\ndust they raised, but we had thought it had been our own caravan, and so\ntook no notice; but as they bent their course one point of the compass,\nor thereabouts, to the southward of the east, and we went due east [?\nwest], they passed by us at some little distance; so that we did not see\nthem, or know anything of them, till evening, when our men came to us\nand gave us this account of them. However, this was a useful experiment\nfor our future conduct in passing the desert, as you shall hear in its\nplace.\n\nWe were now upon our work, and our black prince was head surveyor, for\nhe was an excellent mat-maker himself, and all his men understood it, so\nthat they soon made us near a hundred mats; and as every man, I mean of\nthe negroes, carried one, it was no manner of load, and we did not carry\nan ounce of provisions the less. The greatest burthen was to carry\nsix long poles, besides some shorter stakes; but the negroes made an\nadvantage of that, for carrying them between two, they made the luggage\nof provisions which they had to carry so much the lighter, binding it\nupon two poles, and so made three couple of them. As soon as we saw\nthis, we made a little advantage of it too; for having three or four\nbags, called bottles (I mean skins to carry water), more than the men\ncould carry, we got them filled, and carried them this way, which was a\nday's water and more, for our journey.\n\nHaving now ended our work, made our mats, and fully recruited our stores\nof all things necessary, and having made us abundance of small ropes\nof matting for ordinary use, as we might have occasion, we set forward\nagain, having interrupted our journey eight days in all, upon this\naffair. To our great comfort, the night before we set out there fell a\nvery violent shower of rain, the effects of which we found in the sand;\nthough the heat of one day dried the surface as much as before, yet it\nwas harder at bottom, not so heavy, and was cooler to our feet, by which\nmeans we marched, as we reckoned, about fourteen miles instead of seven,\nand with much more ease.\n\nWhen we came to encamp, we had all things ready, for we had fitted our\ntent, and set it up for trial, where we made it; so that, in less than\nan hour, we had a large tent raised, with an inner and outer apartment,\nand two entrances. In one we lay ourselves, in the other our negroes,\nhaving light pleasant mats over us, and others at the same time under\nus. Also we had a little place without all for our buffaloes, for they\ndeserved our care, being very useful to us, besides carrying forage and\nwater for themselves. Their forage was a root, which our black\nprince directed us to find, not much unlike a parsnip, very moist and\nnourishing, of which there was plenty wherever we came, this horrid\ndesert excepted.\n\nWhen we came the next morning to decamp, our negroes took down the tent,\nand pulled up the stakes; and all was in motion in as little time as it\nwas set up. In this posture we marched eight days, and yet could see no\nend, no change of our prospect, but all looking as wild and dismal as\nat the beginning. If there was any alteration, it was that the sand\nwas nowhere so deep and heavy as it was the first three days. This we\nthought might be because, for six months of the year the winds blowing\nwest (as for the other six they blow constantly east), the sand was\ndriven violently to the side of the desert where we set out, where the\nmountains lying very high, the easterly monsoons, when they blew, had\nnot the same power to drive it back again; and this was confirmed by our\nfinding the like depth of sand on the farthest extent of the desert to\nthe west.\n\nIt was the ninth day of our travel in this wilderness, when we came\nto the view of a great lake of water; and you may be sure this was a\nparticular satisfaction to us, because we had not water left for above\ntwo or three days more, at our shortest allowance; I mean allowing water\nfor our return, if we had been driven to the necessity of it. Our water\nhad served us two days longer than expected, our buffaloes having found,\nfor two or three days, a kind of herb like a broad flat thistle, though\nwithout any prickle, spreading on the ground, and growing in the sand,\nwhich they ate freely of, and which supplied them for drink as well as\nforage.\n\nThe next day, which was the tenth from our setting out, we came to the\nedge of this lake, and, very happily for us, we came to it at the south\npoint of it, for to the north we could see no end of it; so we passed by\nit and travelled three days by the side of it, which was a great comfort\nto us, because it lightened our burthen, there being no need to carry\nwater when we had it in view. And yet, though here was so much water,\nwe found but very little alteration in the desert; no trees, no grass\nor herbage, except that thistle, as I called it, and two or three more\nplants, which we did not understand, of which the desert began to be\npretty full.\n\nBut as we were refreshed with the neighbourhood of this lake of water,\nso we were now gotten among a prodigious number of ravenous inhabitants,\nthe like whereof, it is most certain, the eye of man never saw; for as\nI firmly believe that never man nor body of men passed this desert since\nthe flood, so I believe there is not the like collection of fierce,\nravenous, and devouring creatures in the world; I mean not in any\nparticular place.\n\nFor a day's journey before we came to this lake, and all the three days\nwe were passing by it, and for six or seven days' march after it,\nthe ground was scattered with elephants' teeth in such a number as is\nincredible; and as some of them have lain there for some hundreds of\nyears, so, seeing the substance of them scarce ever decays, they may lie\nthere, for aught I know, to the end of time. The size of some of them\nis, it seems, to those to whom I have reported it, as incredible as\nthe number; and I can assure you there were several so heavy as the\nstrongest man among us could not lift. As to number, I question not but\nthere are enough to load a thousand sail of the biggest ships in the\nworld, by which I may be understood to mean that the quantity is not\nto be conceived of; seeing that as they lasted in view for above eighty\nmiles' travelling, so they might continue as far to the right hand, and\nto the left as far, and many times as far, for aught we knew; for it\nseems the number of elephants hereabouts is prodigiously great. In one\nplace in particular we saw the head of an elephant, with several teeth\nin it, but one of the biggest that ever I saw; the flesh was consumed,\nto be sure, many hundred years before, and all the other bones; but\nthree of our strongest men could not lift this skull and teeth; the\ngreat tooth, I believe, weighed at least three hundredweight; and this\nwas particularly remarkable to me, that I observed the whole skull was\nas good ivory as the teeth, and, I believe, altogether weighed at least\nsix hundredweight; and though I do not know but, by the same rule, all\nthe bones of the elephant may be ivory, yet I think there is this just\nobjection against it from the example before me, that then all the other\nbones of this elephant would have been there as well as the head.\n\nI proposed to our gunner, that, seeing we had travelled now fourteen\ndays without intermission, and that we had water here for our\nrefreshment, and no want of food yet, nor any fear of it, we should rest\nour people a little, and see, at the same time, if perhaps we might\nkill some creatures that were proper for food. The gunner, who had more\nforecast of that kind than I had, agreed to the proposal, and added, why\nmight we not try to catch some fish out of the lake? The first thing we\nhad before us was to try if we could make any hooks, and this indeed put\nour artificer to his trumps; however, with some labour and difficulty,\nhe did it, and we catched fresh fish of several kinds. How they came\nthere, none but He that made the lake and all the world knows; for, to\nbe sure, no human hands ever put any in there, or pulled any out before.\n\nWe not only catched enough for our present refreshment, but we dried\nseveral large fishes, of kinds which I cannot describe, in the sun, by\nwhich we lengthened out our provision considerably; for the heat of\nthe sun dried them so effectually without salt that they were perfectly\ncured, dry, and hard, in one day's time.\n\nWe rested ourselves here five days; during which time we had abundance\nof pleasant adventures with the wild creatures, too many to relate. One\nof them was very particular, which was a chase between a she-lion,\nor lioness, and a large deer; and though the deer is naturally a very\nnimble creature, and she flew by us like the wind, having, perhaps,\nabout 300 yards the start of the lion, yet we found the lion, by her\nstrength, and the goodness of her lungs, got ground of her. They passed\nby us within about a quarter of a mile, and we had a view of them a\ngreat way, when, having given them over, we were surprised, about an\nhour after, to see them come thundering back again on the other side of\nus, and then the lion was within thirty or forty yards of her; and both\nstraining to the extremity of their speed, when the deer, coming to the\nlake, plunged into the water, and swam for her life, as she had before\nrun for it.\n\nThe lioness plunged in after her, and swam a little way, but came back\nagain; and when she was got upon the land she set up the most hideous\nroar that ever I heard in my life, as if done in the rage of having lost\nher prey.\n\nWe walked out morning and evening constantly; the middle of the day we\nrefreshed ourselves under our tent. But one morning early we saw another\nchase, which more nearly concerned us than the other; for our black\nprince, walking by the side of the lake, was set upon by a vast, great\ncrocodile, which came out of the lake upon him; and though he was very\nlight of foot, yet it was as much as he could do to get away. He fled\namain to us, and the truth is, we did not know what to do, for we were\ntold no bullet would enter her; and we found it so at first, for though\nthree of our men fired at her, yet she did not mind them; but my friend\nthe gunner, a venturous fellow, of a bold heart, and great presence\nof mind, went up so near as to thrust the muzzle of his piece into her\nmouth, and fired, but let his piece fall, and ran for it the very moment\nhe had fired it. The creature raged a great while, and spent its fury\nupon the gun, making marks upon the very iron with its teeth, but after\nsome time fainted and died.\n\nOur negroes spread the banks of the lake all this while for game, and at\nlength killed us three deer, one of them very large, the other two very\nsmall. There was water-fowl also in the lake, but we never came near\nenough to them to shoot any; and as for the desert, we saw no fowls\nanywhere in it but at the lake.\n\nWe likewise killed two or three civet cats; but their flesh is the worst\nof carrion. We saw abundance of elephants at a distance, and observed\nthey always go in very good company, that is to say, abundance of them\ntogether, and always extended in a fair line of battle; and this, they\nsay, is the way they defend themselves from their enemies; for if lions\nor tigers, wolves or any creatures, attack them, they being drawn in a\nline, sometimes reaching five or six miles in length, whatever comes in\ntheir way is sure to be trod under foot, or beaten in pieces with their\ntrunks, or lifted up in the air with their trunks; so that if a hundred\nlions or tigers were coming along, if they meet a line of elephants,\nthey will always fly back till they see room to pass by the right hand\nor the left; and if they did not, it would be impossible for one of\nthem to escape; for the elephant, though a heavy creature, is yet so\ndexterous and nimble with his trunk, that he will not fail to lift up\nthe heaviest lion, or any other wild creature, and throw him up in the\nair quite over his back, and then trample him to death with his feet. We\nsaw several lines of battle thus; we saw one so long that indeed there\nwas no end of it to be seen, and I believe there might be 2000 elephants\nin row or line. They are not beasts of prey, but live upon the herbage\nof the field, as an ox does; and it is said, that though they are so\ngreat a creature, yet that a smaller quantity of forage supplies one of\nthem than will suffice a horse.\n\nThe numbers of this kind of creature that are in those parts are\ninconceivable, as may be gathered from the prodigious quantity of\nteeth which, as I said, we saw in this vast desert; and indeed we saw a\nhundred of them to one of any other kind.\n\nOne evening we were very much surprised. We were most of us laid down\non our mats to sleep, when our watch came running in among us, being\nfrighted with the sudden roaring of some lions just by them, which, it\nseems, they had not seen, the night being dark, till they were just upon\nthem. There was, as it proved, an old lion and his whole family, for\nthere was the lioness and three young lions, besides the old king, who\nwas a monstrous great one. One of the young ones--who were good, large,\nwell-grown ones too--leaped up upon one of our negroes, who stood\nsentinel, before he saw him, at which he was heartily frighted, cried\nout, and ran into the tent. Our other man, who had a gun, had not\npresence of mind at first to shoot him, but struck him with the butt-end\nof his piece, which made him whine a little, and then growl at him\nfearfully; but the fellow retired, and, we being all alarmed, three of\nour men snatched up their guns, ran to the tent door, where they saw the\ngreat old lion by the fire of his eyes, and first fired at him, but, we\nsupposed, missed him, or at least did not kill him; for they went all\noff, but raised a most hideous roar, which, as if they had called for\nhelp, brought down a prodigious number of lions, and other furious\ncreatures, we know not what, about them, for we could not see them;\nbut there was a noise, and yelling and howling, and all sorts of such\nwilderness music on every side of us, as if all the beasts of the desert\nwere assembled to devour us.\n\nWe asked our black prince what we should do with them. \"Me go,\" says he,\n\"and fright them all.\" So he snatches up two or three of the worst of\nour mats, and getting one of our men to strike some fire, he hangs the\nmat up at the end of a pole, and set it on fire, and it blazed abroad\na good while; at which the creatures all moved off, for we heard them\nroar, and make their bellowing noise at a great distance. \"Well,\" says\nour gunner, \"if that will do, we need not burn our mats, which are our\nbeds to lay under us, and our tilting to cover us. Let me alone,\" says\nhe. So he comes back into our tent, and falls to making some artificial\nfireworks and the like; and he gave our sentinels some to be ready\nat hand upon occasion, and particularly he placed a great piece of\nwild-fire upon the same pole that the mat had been tied to, and set it\non fire, and that burnt there so long that all the wild creatures left\nus for that time.\n\nHowever, we began to be weary of such company; and, to be rid of them,\nwe set forward again two days sooner than we intended. We found now,\nthat though the desert did not end, nor could we see any appearance of\nit, yet that the earth was pretty full of green stuff of one sort or\nanother, so that our cattle had no want; and secondly, that there\nwere several little rivers which ran into the lake, and so long as the\ncountry continued low, we found water sufficient, which eased us very\nmuch in our carriage, and we went on still sixteen days more without yet\ncoming to any appearance of better soil. After this we found the country\nrise a little, and by that we perceived that the water would fail us;\nso, for fear of the worst, we filled our bladder-bottles with water.\nWe found the country rising gradually thus for three days continually,\nwhen, on the sudden, we perceived that, though we had mounted up\ninsensibly, yet that we were on the top of a very high ridge of hills,\nthough not such as at first.\n\nWhen we came to look down on the other side of the hills, we saw, to\nthe great joy of all our hearts, that the desert was at an end; that the\ncountry was clothed with green, abundance of trees, and a large river;\nand we made no doubt but that we should find people and cattle also; and\nhere, by our gunner's account, who kept our computations, we had\nmarched about 400 miles over this dismal place of horror, having been\nfour-and-thirty days a-doing of it, and consequently were come about\n1100 miles of our journey.\n\nWe would willingly have descended the hills that night, but it was\ntoo late. The next morning we saw everything more plain, and rested\nourselves under the shade of some trees, which were now the most\nrefreshing things imaginable to us, who had been scorched above a month\nwithout a tree to cover us. We found the country here very pleasant,\nespecially considering that we came from; and we killed some deer here\nalso, which we found very frequent under the cover of the woods. Also we\nkilled a creature like a goat, whose flesh was very good to eat, but it\nwas no goat; we found also a great number of fowls like partridge, but\nsomething smaller, and were very tame; so that we lived here very well,\nbut found no people, at least none that would be seen, no, not for\nseveral days' journey; and to allay our joy, we were almost every night\ndisturbed with lions and tigers; elephants, indeed, we saw none here.\n\nIn three days' march we came to a river, which we saw from the hills,\nand which we called the Golden River; and we found it ran northward,\nwhich was the first stream we had met with that did so. It ran with a\nvery rapid current, and our gunner, pulling out his map, assured me that\nthis was either the river Nile, or run into the great lake out of which\nthe river Nile was said to take its beginning; and he brought out his\ncharts and maps, which, by his instruction, I began to understand very\nwell, and told me he would convince me of it, and indeed he seemed to\nmake it so plain to me that I was of the same opinion.\n\nBut I did not enter into the gunner's reason for this inquiry, not in\nthe least, till he went on with it farther, and stated it thus:--\"If\nthis is the river Nile, why should not we build some more canoes, and go\ndown this stream, rather than expose ourselves to any more deserts and\nscorching sands in quest of the sea, which when we are come to, we shall\nbe as much at a loss how to get home as we were at Madagascar?\"\n\nThe argument was good, had there been no objections in the way of a kind\nwhich none of us were capable of answering; but, upon the whole, it\nwas an undertaking of such a nature that every one of us thought it\nimpracticable, and that upon several accounts; and our surgeon, who was\nhimself a good scholar and a man of reading, though not acquainted\nwith the business of sailing, opposed it, and some of his reasons, I\nremember, were such as these:--First, the length of the way, which both\nhe and the gunner allowed, by the course of the water, and turnings\nof the river, would be at least 4000 miles. Secondly, the innumerable\ncrocodiles in the river, which we should never be able to escape.\nThirdly, the dreadful deserts in the way; and lastly, the approaching\nrainy season, in which the streams of the Nile would be so furious, and\nrise so high--spreading far and wide over all the plain country--that\nwe should never be able to know when we were in the channel of the river\nand when not, and should certainly be cast away, overset, or run\naground so often that it would be impossible to proceed by a river so\nexcessively dangerous.\n\nThis last reason he made so plain to us that we began to be sensible of\nit ourselves, so that we agreed to lay that thought aside, and proceed\nin our first course, westwards towards the sea; but, as if we had been\nloth to depart, we continued, by way of refreshing ourselves, to loiter\ntwo days upon this river, in which time our black prince, who delighted\nmuch in wandering up and down, came one evening and brought us several\nlittle bits of something, he knew not what, but he found it felt heavy\nand looked well, and showed it to me as what he thought was some rarity.\nI took not much notice of it to him, but stepping out and calling the\ngunner to me I showed it to him, and told him what I thought, viz.,\nthat it was certainly gold. He agreed with me in that, and also in what\nfollowed, that we would take the black prince out with us the next day,\nand make him show us where he found it; that if there was any quantity\nto be found we would tell our company of it, but if there was but little\nwe would keep counsel, and have it to ourselves.\n\nBut we forgot to engage the prince in the secret, who innocently told so\nmuch to all the rest, as that they guessed what it was, and came to us\nto see. When we found it was public, we were more concerned to prevent\ntheir suspecting that we had any design to conceal it, and openly\ntelling our thoughts of it, we called our artificer, who agreed\npresently that it was gold; so I proposed that we should all go with\nthe prince to the place where he found it, and if any quantity was to be\nhad, we would lie here some time and see what we could make of it.\n\nAccordingly we went every man of us, for no man was willing to be left\nbehind in a discovery of such a nature. When we came to the place we\nfound it was on the west side of the river, not in the main river, but\nin another small river or stream which came from the west, and ran into\nthe other at that place. We fell to raking in the sand, and washing it\nin our hands; and we seldom took up a handful of sand but we washed\nsome little round lumps as big as a pin's head, or sometimes as big as a\ngrape stone, into our hands; and we found, in two or three hours'\ntime, that every one had got some, so we agreed to leave off, and go to\ndinner.\n\nWhile we were eating, it came into my thoughts that while we worked at\nthis rate in a thing of such nicety and consequence, it was ten to one\nif the gold, which was the make-bait of the world, did not, first or\nlast, set us together by the ears, to break our good articles and our\nunderstanding one among another, and perhaps cause us to part companies,\nor worse; I therefore told them that I was indeed the youngest man in\nthe company, but as they had always allowed me to give my opinion in\nthings, and had sometimes been pleased to follow my advice, so I\nhad something to propose now, which I thought would be for all our\nadvantages, and I believed they would all like it very well. I told them\nwe were in a country where we all knew there was a great deal of gold,\nand that all the world sent ships thither to get it; that we did not\nindeed know where it was, and so we might get a great deal, or a little,\nwe did not know whether; but I offered it to them to consider whether it\nwould not be the best way for us, and to preserve the good harmony\nand friendship that had been always kept among us, and which was so\nabsolutely necessary to our safety, that what we found should be brought\ntogether to one common stock, and be equally divided at last, rather\nthan to run the hazard of any difference which might happen among us\nfrom any one's having found more or less than another. I told them, that\nif we were all upon one bottom we should all apply ourselves heartily to\nthe work; and, besides that, we might then set our negroes all to work\nfor us, and receive equally the fruit of their labour and of our own,\nand being all exactly alike sharers, there could be no just cause of\nquarrel or disgust among us.\n\nThey all approved the proposal, and every one jointly swore, and gave\ntheir hands to one another, that they would not conceal the least grain\nof gold from the rest; and consented that if any one or more should\nbe found to conceal any, all that he had should be taken from him\nand divided among the rest; and one thing more was added to it by our\ngunner, from considerations equally good and just, that if any one of\nus, by any play, bet, game, or wager, won any money or gold, or the\nvalue of any, from another, during our whole voyage, till our return\nquite to Portugal, he should be obliged by us all to restore it again\non the penalty of being disarmed and turned out of the company, and of\nhaving no relief from us on any account whatever. This was to prevent\nwagering and playing for money, which our men were apt to do by several\nmeans and at several games, though they had neither cards nor dice.\n\nHaving made this wholesome agreement, we went cheerfully to work, and\nshowed our negroes how to work for us; and working up the stream on both\nsides, and in the bottom of the river, we spent about three weeks' time\ndabbling in the water; by which time, as it lay all in our way, we had\ngone about six miles, and not more; and still the higher we went, the\nmore gold we found; till at last, having passed by the side of a hill,\nwe perceived on a sudden that the gold stopped, and that there was not\na bit taken up beyond that place. It presently occurred to my mind, that\nit must then be from the side of that little hill that all the gold we\nfound was worked down.\n\nUpon this, we went back to the hill, and fell to work with that. We\nfound the earth loose, and of a yellowish loamy colour, and in some\nplaces a white hard kind of stone, which, in describing since to some\nof our artists, they tell me was the spar which is found by ore, and\nsurrounds it in the mine. However, if it had been all gold, we had no\ninstrument to force it out; so we passed that. But scratching into the\nloose earth with our fingers, we came to a surprising place, where\nthe earth, for the quantity of two bushels, I believe, or thereabouts,\ncrumbled down with little more than touching it, and apparently showed\nus that there was a great deal of gold in it. We took it all carefully\nup, and washing it in the water, the loamy earth washed away, and left\nthe gold dust free in our hands; and that which was more remarkable was,\nthat, when this loose earth was all taken away, and we came to the rock\nor hard stone, there was not one grain of gold more to be found.\n\nAt night we all came together to see what we had got; and it appeared\nwe had found, in that day's heap of earth, about fifty pounds' weight of\ngold dust, and about thirty-four pounds' weight more in all the rest of\nour works in the river.\n\nIt was a happy kind of disappointment to us, that we found a full stop\nput to our work; for, had the quantity of gold been ever so small, yet,\nhad any at all come, I do not know when we should have given over; for,\nhaving rummaged this place, and not finding the least grain of gold\nin any other place, or in any of the earth there, except in that loose\nparcel, we went quite back down the small river again, working it over\nand over again, as long as we could find anything, how small soever; and\nwe did get six or seven pounds more the second time. Then we went into\nthe first river, and tried it up the stream and down the stream, on the\none side and on the other. Up the stream we found nothing, no, not a\ngrain; down the stream we found very little, not above the quantity of\nhalf an ounce in two miles' working; so back we came again to the Golden\nRiver, as we justly called it, and worked it up the stream and down the\nstream twice more apiece, and every time we found some gold, and perhaps\nmight have done so if we had stayed there till this time; but the\nquantity was at last so small, and the work so much the harder, that we\nagreed by consent to give it over, lest we should fatigue ourselves and\nour negroes so as to be quite unfit for our journey.\n\nWhen we had brought all our purchase together, we had in the whole three\npounds and a half of gold to a man, share and share alike, according to\nsuch a weight and scale as our ingenious cutler made for us to weigh it\nby, which indeed he did by guess, but which, as he said, he was sure\nwas rather more than less, and so it proved at last; for it was near\ntwo ounces more than weight in a pound. Besides this, there was seven\nor eight pounds' weight left, which we agreed to leave in his hands, to\nwork it into such shapes as we thought fit, to give away to such people\nas we might yet meet with, from whom we might have occasion to buy\nprovisions, or even to buy friendship, or the like; and particularly we\ngave about a pound to our black prince, which he hammered and worked by\nhis own indefatigable hand, and some tools our artificer lent him, into\nlittle round bits, as round almost as beads, though not exact in shape,\nand drilling holes through them, put them all upon a string, and wore\nthem about his black neck, and they looked very well there, I assure\nyou; but he was many months a-doing it. And thus ended our first golden\nadventure.\n\nWe now began to discover what we had not troubled our heads much about\nbefore, and that was, that, let the country be good or bad that we were\nin, we could not travel much further for a considerable time. We had\nbeen now five months and upwards in our journey, and the seasons began\nto change; and nature told us, that, being in a climate that had a\nwinter as well as a summer, though of a different kind from what our\ncountry produced, we were to expect a wet season, and such as we should\nnot be able to travel in, as well by reason of the rain itself, as of\nthe floods which it would occasion wherever we should come; and\nthough we had been no strangers to those wet seasons in the island\nof Madagascar, yet we had not thought much of them since we began our\ntravels; for, setting out when the sun was about the solstice, that is,\nwhen it was at the greatest northern distance from us, we had found\nthe benefit of it in our travels. But now it drew near us apace, and we\nfound it began to rain; upon which we called another general council, in\nwhich we debated our present circumstances, and, in particular, whether\nwe should go forward, or seek for a proper place upon the bank of our\nGolden River, which had been so lucky to us, to fix our camp for the\nwinter.\n\nUpon the whole, it was resolved to abide where we were; and it was not\nthe least part of our happiness that we did so, as shall appear in its\nplace.\n\nHaving resolved upon this, our first measures were to set our negroes to\nwork, to make huts or houses for our habitation, and this they did very\ndexterously; only that we changed the ground where we at first intended\nit, thinking, as indeed it happened, that the river might reach it upon\nany sudden rain. Our camp was like a little town, in which our huts were\nin the centre, having one large one in the centre of them also, into\nwhich all our particular lodgings opened; so that none of us went into\nour apartments but through a public tent, where we all ate and drank\ntogether, and kept our councils and society; and our carpenters made us\ntables, benches, and stools in abundance, as many as we could make use\nof.\n\nWe had no need of chimneys, it was hot enough without fire; but yet\nwe found ourselves at last obliged to keep a fire every night upon a\nparticular occasion. For though we had in all other respects a very\npleasant and agreeable situation, yet we were rather worse troubled with\nthe unwelcome visits of wild beasts here than in the wilderness itself;\nfor as the deer and other gentle creatures came hither for shelter\nand food, so the lions and tigers and leopards haunted these places\ncontinually for prey.\n\nWhen first we discovered this we were so uneasy at it that we thought of\nremoving our situation; but after many debates about it we resolved to\nfortify ourselves in such a manner as not to be in any danger from it;\nand this our carpenters undertook, who first palisaded our camp quite\nround with long stakes, for we had wood enough, which stakes were not\nstuck in one by another like pales, but in an irregular manner; a\ngreat multitude of them so placed that they took up near two yards in\nthickness, some higher, some lower, all sharpened at the top, and about\na foot asunder: so that had any creature jumped at them, unless he had\ngone clean over, which it was very hard to do, he would be hung upon\ntwenty or thirty spikes.\n\nThe entrance into this had larger stakes than the rest, so placed before\none another as to make three or four short turnings which no four-footed\nbeast bigger than a dog could possibly come in at; and that we might not\nbe attacked by any multitude together, and consequently be alarmed in\nour sleep, as we had been, or be obliged to waste our ammunition, which\nwe were very chary of, we kept a great fire every night without the\nentrance of our palisade, having a hut for our two sentinels to stand\nin free from the rain, just within the entrance, and right against the\nfire.\n\nTo maintain this fire we cut a prodigious deal of wood, and piled it up\nin a heap to dry, and with the green boughs made a second covering over\nour huts, so high and thick that it might cast the rain from the first,\nand keep us effectually dry.\n\nWe had scarcely finished all these works but the rain came on so fierce\nand so continued that we had little time to stir abroad for food, except\nindeed that our negroes, who wore no clothes, seemed to make nothing of\nthe rain; though to us Europeans, in those hot climates, nothing is more\ndangerous.\n\nWe continued in this posture for four months, that is to say, from the\nmiddle of June to the middle of October; for though the rains went off,\nat least the greatest violence of them, about the equinox, yet, as the\nsun was then just over our heads, we resolved to stay awhile till it\npassed a little to the southward.\n\nDuring our encampment here we had several adventures with the ravenous\ncreatures of that country; and had not our fire been always kept\nburning, I question much whether all our fence, though we strengthened\nit afterwards with twelve or fourteen rows of stakes or more, would have\nkept us secure. It was always in the night that we had the disturbance\nof them, and sometimes they came in such multitudes that we thought\nall the lions and tigers, and leopards and wolves of Africa were come\ntogether to attack us. One night, being clear moonshine, one of our\nmen being upon the watch, told us that he verily believed he saw ten\nthousand wild creatures of one sort or another pass by our little camp,\nand ever as they saw the fire they sheered off, but were sure to howl or\nroar, or whatever it was, when they were past.\n\nThe music of their voices was very far from being pleasant to us, and\nsometimes would be so very disturbing that we could not sleep for it;\nand often our sentinels would call us that were awake to come and look\nat them. It was one windy, tempestuous night, after a rainy day, that\nwe were indeed called up; for such innumerable numbers of devilish\ncreatures came about us that our watch really thought they would attack\nus. They would not come on the side where the fire was; and though we\nthought ourselves secure everywhere else, yet we all got up and took to\nour arms. The moon was near the full, but the air full of flying clouds,\nand a strange hurricane of wind to add to the terror of the night; when,\nlooking on the back part of our camp, I thought I saw a creature within\nour fortification, and so indeed he was, except his haunches, for he\nhad taken a running leap, I suppose, and with all his might had thrown\nhimself clear over our palisades, except one strong pile, which stood\nhigher than the rest, and which had caught hold of him, and by his\nweight he had hanged himself upon it, the spike of the pile running into\nhis hinder haunch or thigh, on the inside; and by that he hung, growling\nand biting the wood for rage. I snatched up a lance from one of the\nnegroes that stood just by me, and running to him, struck it three\nor four times into him, and despatched him, being unwilling to shoot,\nbecause I had a mind to have a volley fired among the rest, whom I could\nsee standing without, as thick as a drove of bullocks going to a fair. I\nimmediately called our people out, and showed them the object of terror\nwhich I had seen, and, without any further consultation, fired a full\nvolley among them, most of our pieces being loaded with two or three\nslugs or bullets apiece. It made a horrible clutter among them, and in\ngeneral they all took to their heels, only that we could observe that\nsome walked off with more gravity and majesty than others, being not\nso much frighted at the noise and fire; and we could perceive that some\nwere left upon the ground struggling as for life, but we durst not stir\nout to see what they were.\n\nIndeed they stood so thick, and were so near us, that we could not\nwell miss killing or wounding some of them, and we believed they had\ncertainly the smell of us, and our victuals we had been killing; for we\nhad killed a deer, and three or four of those creatures like goats the\nday before; and some of the offal had been thrown out behind our camp,\nand this, we suppose, drew them so much about us; but we avoided it for\nthe future.\n\nThough the creatures fled, yet we heard a frightful roaring all night\nat the place where they stood, which we supposed was from some that were\nwounded, and as soon as day came we went out to see what execution we\nhad done. And indeed it was a strange sight; there were three tigers and\ntwo wolves quite killed, besides the creature I had killed within our\npalisade, which seemed to be of an ill-gendered kind, between a tiger\nand a leopard. Besides this there was a noble old lion alive, but with\nboth his fore-legs broke, so that he could not stir away, and he had\nalmost beat himself to death with struggling all night, and we found\nthat this was the wounded soldier that had roared so loud and given us\nso much disturbance. Our surgeon, looking at him, smiled. \"Now,\" says\nhe, \"if I could be sure this lion would be as grateful to me as one\nof his majesty's ancestors was to Androcles, the Roman slave, I would\ncertainly set both his legs again and cure him.\" I had not heard the\nstory of Androcles, so he told it me at large; but as to the surgeon, we\ntold him he had no way to know whether the lion would do so or not, but\nto cure him first and trust to his honour; but he had no faith, so to\ndespatch him and put him out of his torment, he shot him in the head and\nkilled him, for which we called him the king-killer ever after.\n\nOur negroes found no less than five of these ravenous creatures wounded\nand dropped at a distance from our quarters; whereof, one was a wolf,\none a fine spotted young leopard, and the other were creatures that we\nknew not what to call them.\n\nWe had several more of these gentlefolks about after that, but no such\ngeneral rendezvous of them as that was any more; but this ill effect\nit had to us, that it frighted the deer and other creatures from our\nneighbourhood, of whose company we were much more desirous, and which\nwere necessary for our subsistence. However, our negroes went out every\nday a-hunting, as they called it, with bow and arrow, and they scarce\never failed of bringing us home something or other; and particularly we\nfound in this part of the country, after the rains had fallen some time,\nabundance of wild fowl, such as we have in England, duck, teal, widgeon,\netc.; some geese, and some kinds that we had never seen before; and we\nfrequently killed them. Also we catched a great deal of fresh fish out\nof the river, so that we wanted no provision. If we wanted anything, it\nwas salt to eat with our fresh meat; but we had a little left, and we\nused it sparingly; for as to our negroes, they could not taste it, nor\ndid they care to eat any meat that was seasoned with it.\n\nThe weather began now to clear up, the rains were down, and the floods\nabated, and the sun, which had passed our zenith, was gone to the\nsouthward a good way; so we prepared to go on our way.\n\nIt was the 12th of October, or thereabouts, that we began to set\nforward; and having an easy country to travel in, as well as to supply\nus with provisions, though still without inhabitants, we made more\ndespatch, travelling sometimes, as we calculated it, twenty or\ntwenty-five miles a day; nor did we halt anywhere in eleven days' march,\none day excepted, which was to make a raft to carry us over a small\nriver, which, having swelled with the rains, was not yet quite down.\n\nWhen we were past this river, which, by the way, ran to the northward\ntoo, we found a great row of hills in our way. We saw, indeed, the\ncountry open to the right at a great distance; but, as we kept true to\nour course, due west, we were not willing to go a great way out of our\nway, only to shun a few hills. So we advanced; but we were surprised\nwhen, being not quite come to the top, one of our company, who, with two\nnegroes, was got up before us, cried out, \"The sea! the sea!\" and fell\na-dancing and jumping, as signs of joy.\n\nThe gunner and I were most surprised at it, because we had but that\nmorning been calculating that we must have yet above 1000 miles on the\nsea side, and that we could not expect to reach it till another rainy\nseason would be upon us; so that when our man cried out, \"The sea,\" the\ngunner was angry, and said he was mad.\n\nBut we were both in the greatest surprise imaginable, when, coming to\nthe top of the hill, and though it was very high, we saw nothing but\nwater, either before us or to the right hand or the left, being a vast\nsea, without any bounds but the horizon.\n\nWe went down the hill full of confusion of thought, not being able\nto conceive whereabouts we were or what it must be, seeing by all our\ncharts the sea was yet a vast way off.\n\nIt was not above three miles from the hills before we came to the shore,\nor water-edge of this sea, and there, to our further surprise, we found\nthe water fresh and pleasant to drink; so that, in short, we knew not\nwhat course to take. The sea, as we thought it to be, put a full stop\nto our journey (I mean westward), for it lay just in the way. Our next\nquestion was, which hand to turn to, to the right hand or the left,\nbut this was soon resolved; for, as we knew not the extent of it, we\nconsidered that our way, if it had been the sea really, must be on the\nnorth, and therefore, if we went to the south now, it must be just so\nmuch out of our way at last. So, having spent a good part of the day in\nour surprise at the thing, and consulting what to do, we set forward to\nthe north.\n\nWe travelled upon the shore of this sea full twenty-three days before\nwe could come to any resolution about what it was; at the end of which,\nearly one morning, one of our seamen cried out, \"Land!\" and it was no\nfalse alarm, for we saw plainly the tops of some hills at a very great\ndistance, on the further side of the water, due west; but though this\nsatisfied us that it was not the ocean, but an inland sea or lake, yet\nwe saw no land to the northward, that is to say, no end of it, but were\nobliged to travel eight days more, and near 100 miles farther, before\nwe came to the end of it, and then we found this lake or sea ended in a\nvery great river which ran N. or N. by E., as the other river had done\nwhich I mentioned before.\n\nMy friend the gunner, upon examining, said that he believed that he was\nmistaken before, and that this was the river Nile, but was still of the\nmind that we were of before, that we should not think of a voyage into\nEgypt that way; so we resolved upon crossing this river, which, however,\nwas not so easy as before, the river being very rapid and the channel\nvery broad.\n\nIt cost us, therefore, a week here to get materials to waft ourselves\nand cattle over this river; for though here were stores of trees, yet\nthere was none of any considerable growth sufficient to make a canoe.\n\nDuring our march on the edge of this bank we met with great fatigue, and\ntherefore travelled a fewer miles in a day than before, there being such\na prodigious number of little rivers that came down from the hills on\nthe east side, emptying themselves into this gulf, all which waters were\npretty high, the rains having been but newly over.\n\nIn the last three days of our travel we met with some inhabitants, but\nwe found they lived upon the little hills and not by the water-side; nor\nwere we a little put to it for food in this march, having killed nothing\nfor four or five days but some fish we caught out of the lake, and that\nnot in such plenty as we found before.\n\nBut, to make us some amends, we had no disturbance upon all the shores\nof this lake from any wild beasts; the only inconveniency of that kind\nwas, that we met an ugly, venomous, deformed kind of a snake or serpent\nin the wet grounds near the lake, that several times pursued us as if\nit would attack us; and if we struck or threw anything at it, it would\nraise itself up and hiss so loud that it might be heard a great way.\nIt had a hellish ugly deformed look and voice, and our men would not be\npersuaded but it was the devil, only that we did not know what business\nSatan could have there, where there were no people.\n\nIt was very remarkable that we had now travelled 1000 miles without\nmeeting with any people in the heart of the whole continent of Africa,\nwhere, to be sure, never man set his foot since the sons of Noah spread\nthemselves over the face of the whole earth. Here also our gunner took\nan observation with his forestaff, to determine our latitude, and he\nfound now, that having marched about thirty-three days northward, we\nwere in 6 degrees 22 minutes south latitude.\n\nAfter having with great difficulty got over this river, we came into a\nstrange wild country that began a little to affright us; for though the\ncountry was not a desert of dry scalding sand as that was we had passed\nbefore, yet it was mountainous, barren, and infinitely full of most\nfurious wild beasts, more than any place we had passed yet. There was\nindeed a kind of coarse herbage on the surface, and now and then a few\ntrees, or rather shrubs. But people we could see none, and we began\nto be in great suspense about victuals, for we had not killed a deer\na great while, but had lived chiefly upon fish and fowl, always by the\nwater-side, both which seemed to fail us now; and we were in the more\nconsternation, because we could not lay in a stock here to proceed upon,\nas we did before, but were obliged to set out with scarcity, and without\nany certainty of a supply.\n\nWe had, however, no remedy but patience; and having killed some fowls\nand dried some fish, as much as, with short allowance, we reckoned would\nlast us five days, we resolved to venture, and venture we did; nor\nwas it without cause that we were apprehensive of the danger, for\nwe travelled the five days and met neither with fish nor fowl, nor\nfour-footed beast, whose flesh was fit to eat, and we were in a most\ndreadful apprehension of being famished to death. On the sixth day we\nalmost fasted, or, as we may say, we ate up all the scraps of what we\nhad left, and at night lay down supperless upon our mats, with heavy\nhearts, being obliged the eighth day to kill one of our poor faithful\nservants, the buffaloes that carried our baggage. The flesh of this\ncreature was very good, and so sparingly did we eat of it that it lasted\nus all three days and a half, and was just spent; and we were on the\npoint of killing another when we saw before us a country that promised\nbetter, having high trees and a large river in the middle of it.\n\nThis encouraged us, and we quickened our march for the river-side,\nthough with empty stomachs, and very faint and weak; but before we came\nto this river we had the good hap to meet with some young deer, a thing\nwe had long wished for. In a word, having shot three of them, we came to\na full stop to fill our bellies, and never gave the flesh time to cool\nbefore we ate it; nay, it was much we could stay to kill it and had not\neaten it alive, for we were, in short, almost famished.\n\nThrough all that inhospitable country we saw continually lions, tigers,\nleopards, civet cats, and abundance of kinds of creatures that we did\nnot understand; we saw no elephants, but every now and then we met with\nan elephant's tooth lying on the ground, and some of them lying, as it\nwere, half buried by the length of time that they had lain there.\n\nWhen we came to the shore of this river, we found it ran northerly\nstill, as all the rest had done, but with this difference, that as the\ncourse of the other rivers were N. by E. or N.N.E., the course of this\nlay N.W.N.\n\nOn the farther bank of this river we saw some sign of inhabitants,\nbut met with none for the first day; but the next day we came into an\ninhabited country, the people all negroes, and stark naked, without\nshame, both men and women.\n\nWe made signs of friendship to them, and found them a very frank,\ncivil, and friendly sort of people. They came to our negroes without\nany suspicion, nor did they give us any reason to suspect them of any\nvillainy, as the others had done; we made signs to them that we were\nhungry, and immediately some naked women ran and fetched us great\nquantities of roots, and of things like pumpkins, which we made no\nscruple to eat; and our artificer showed them some of his trinkets that\nhe had made, some of iron, some of silver, but none of gold. They had so\nmuch judgment as to choose that of silver before the iron; but when we\nshowed them some gold, we found they did not value it so much as either\nof the other.\n\nFor some of these things they brought us more provisions, and three\nliving creatures as big as calves, but not of that kind; neither did we\never see any of them before; their flesh was very good; and after that\nthey brought us twelve more, and some smaller creatures like hares; all\nwhich were very welcome to us, who were indeed at a very great loss for\nprovisions.\n\nWe grew very intimate with these people, and indeed they were the\ncivillest and most friendly people that we met with at all, and mightily\npleased with us; and, which was very particular, they were much easier\nto be made to understand our meaning than any we had met with before.\n\nAt last we began to inquire our way, pointing to the west. They made us\nunderstand easily that we could not go that way, but they pointed to us\nthat we might go north-west, so that we presently understood that there\nwas another lake in our way, which proved to be true; for in two days\nmore we saw it plain, and it held us till we passed the equinoctial\nline, lying all the way on our left hand, though at a great distance.\n\nTravelling thus northward, our gunner seemed very anxious about our\nproceedings; for he assured us, and made me sensible of it by the\nmaps which he had been teaching me out of, that when we came into the\nlatitude of six degrees, or thereabouts, north of the line, the land\ntrended away to the west to such a length that we should not come at the\nsea under a march of above 1500 miles farther westward than the country\nwe desired to go to. I asked him if there were no navigable rivers that\nwe might meet with, which, running into the west ocean, might perhaps\ncarry us down their stream, and then, if it were 1500 miles, or twice\n1500 miles, we might do well enough if we could but get provisions.\n\nHere he showed me the maps again, and that there appeared no river whose\nstream was of any such a length as to do any kindness, till we came\nperhaps within 200 or 300 miles of the shore, except the Rio Grande, as\nthey call it, which lay farther northward from us, at least 700 miles;\nand that then he knew not what kind of country it might carry us\nthrough; for he said it was his opinion that the heats on the north of\nthe line, even in the same latitude, were violent, and the country more\ndesolate, barren, and barbarous, than those of the south; and that when\nwe came among the negroes in the north part of Africa, next the sea,\nespecially those who had seen and trafficked with the Europeans, such as\nDutch, English, Portuguese, Spaniards, etc., they had most of them been\nso ill-used at some time or other that they would certainly put all the\nspite they could upon us in mere revenge.\n\nUpon these considerations he advised us that, as soon as we had passed\nthis lake, we should proceed W.S.W., that is to say, a little inclining\nto the south, and that in time we should meet with the great river\nCongo, from whence the coast is called Congo, being a little north of\nAngola, where we intended at first to go.\n\nI asked him if ever he had been on the coast of Congo. He said, yes, he\nhad, but was never on shore there. Then I asked him how we should get\nfrom thence to the coast where the European ships came, seeing, if the\nland trended away west for 1500 miles, we must have all that shore to\ntraverse before we could double the west point of it.\n\nHe told me it was ten to one but we should hear of some European ships\nto take us in, for that they often visited the coast of Congo and\nAngola, in trade with the negroes; and that if we could not, yet, if\nwe could but find provisions, we should make our way as well along the\nsea-shore as along the river, till we came to the Gold Coast, which, he\nsaid, was not above 400 or 500 miles north of Congo, besides the turning\nof the coast west about 300 more; that shore being in the latitude of\nsix or seven degrees; and that there the English, or Dutch, or French\nhad settlements or factories, perhaps all of them.\n\nI confess I had more mind, all the while he argued, to have gone\nnorthward, and shipped ourselves in the Rio Grande, or, as the traders\ncall it, the river Negro or Niger, for I knew that at last it would\nbring us down to the Cape de Verd, where we were sure of relief;\nwhereas, at the coast we were going to now, we had a prodigious way\nstill to go, either by sea or land, and no certainty which way to get\nprovisions but by force; but for the present I held my tongue, because\nit was my tutor's opinion.\n\nBut when, according to his desire, we came to turn southward, having\npassed beyond the second great lake, our men began all to be uneasy,\nand said we were now out of our way for certain, for that we were going\nfarther from home, and that we were indeed far enough off already.\n\nBut we had not marched above twelve days more, eight whereof were taken\nup in rounding the lake, and four more south-west, in order to make for\nthe river Congo, but we were put to another full stop, by entering a\ncountry so desolate, so frightful, and so wild, that we knew not what to\nthink or do; for, besides that it appeared as a terrible and boundless\ndesert, having neither woods, trees, rivers, or inhabitants, so even the\nplace where we were was desolate of inhabitants, nor had we any way to\ngather in a stock of provisions for the passing of this desert, as we\ndid before at our entering the first, unless we had marched back four\ndays to the place where we turned the head of the lake.\n\nWell, notwithstanding this, we ventured; for, to men that had passed\nsuch wild places as we had done, nothing could seem too desperate to\nundertake. We ventured, I say, and the rather because we saw very high\nmountains in our way at a great distance, and we imagined, wherever\nthere were mountains there would be springs and rivers; where rivers\nthere would be trees and grass; where trees and grass there would\nbe cattle; and where cattle, some kind of inhabitants. At last, in\nconsequence of this speculative philosophy, we entered this waste,\nhaving a great heap of roots and plants for our bread, such as the\nIndians gave us, a very little flesh or salt, and but a little water.\n\nWe travelled two days towards those hills, and still they seemed as\nfar off as they did at first, and it was the fifth day before we got to\nthem; indeed, we travelled but softly, for it was excessively hot; and\nwe were much about the very equinoctial line, we hardly knew whether to\nthe south or the north of it.\n\nAs we had concluded, that where there were hills there would be springs,\nso it happened; but we were not only surprised, but really frighted, to\nfind the first spring we came to, and which looked admirably clear and\nbeautiful, to be salt as brine. It was a terrible disappointment to us,\nand put us under melancholy apprehensions at first; but the gunner, who\nwas of a spirit never discouraged, told us we should not be disturbed at\nthat, but be very thankful, for salt was a bait we stood in as much need\nof as anything, and there was no question but we should find fresh water\nas well as salt; and here our surgeon stepped in to encourage us, and\ntold us that if we did not know he would show us a way how to make that\nsalt water fresh, which indeed made us all more cheerful, though we\nwondered what he meant.\n\nMeantime our men, without bidding, had been seeking about for other\nsprings, and found several; but still they were all salt; from whence\nwe concluded that there was a salt rock or mineral stone in those\nmountains, and perhaps they might be all of such a substance; but still\nI wondered by what witchcraft it was that our artist the surgeon would\nmake this salt water turn fresh, and I longed to see the experiment,\nwhich was indeed a very odd one; but he went to work with as much\nassurance as if he had tried it on the very spot before.\n\nHe took two of our large mats and sewed them together, and they made a\nkind of a bag four feet broad, three feet and a half high, and about a\nfoot and a half thick when it was full.\n\nHe caused us to fill this bag with dry sand and tread it down as close\nas we could, not to burst the mats. When thus the bag was full within\na foot, he sought some other earth and filled up the rest with it, and\nstill trod all in as hard as he could. When he had done, he made a\nhole in the upper earth about as broad as the crown of a large hat, or\nsomething bigger about, but not so deep, and bade a negro fill it with\nwater, and still as it shrunk away to fill it again, and keep it full.\nThe bag he had placed at first across two pieces of wood, about a foot\nfrom the ground; and under it he ordered some of our skins to be spread\nthat would hold water. In about an hour, and not sooner, the water\nbegan to come dropping through the bottom of the bag, and, to our great\nsurprise, was perfectly fresh and sweet, and this continued for several\nhours; but in the end the water began to be a little brackish. When we\ntold him that, \"Well, then,\" said he, \"turn the sand out, and fill it\nagain.\" Whether he did this by way of experiment from his own fancy, or\nwhether he had seen it done before, I do not remember.\n\nThe next day we mounted the tops of the hills, where the prospect was\nindeed astonishing, for as far as the eye could look, south, or west, or\nnorthwest, there was nothing to be seen but a vast howling wilderness,\nwith neither tree nor river, nor any green thing. The surface we found,\nas the part we passed the day before, had a kind of thick moss upon\nit, of a blackish dead colour, but nothing in it that looked like food,\neither for man or beast.\n\nHad we been stored with provisions to have entered for ten or twenty\ndays upon this wilderness, as we were formerly, and with fresh water, we\nhad hearts good enough to have ventured, though we had been obliged to\ncome back again, for if we went north we did not know but we might meet\nwith the same; but we neither had provisions, neither were we in any\nplace where it was possible to get them. We killed some wild ferine\ncreatures at the foot of these hills; but, except two things, like to\nnothing that we ever saw before, we met with nothing that was fit\nto eat. These were creatures that seemed to be between the kind of a\nbuffalo and a deer, but indeed resembled neither; for they had no horns,\nand had great legs like a cow, with a fine head, and the neck like a\ndeer. We killed also, at several times, a tiger, two young lions, and a\nwolf; but, God be thanked, we were not so reduced as to eat carrion.\n\nUpon this terrible prospect I renewed my motion of turning northward,\nand making towards the river Niger or Rio Grande, then to turn west\ntowards the English settlements on the Gold Coast; to which every one\nmost readily consented, only our gunner, who was indeed our best guide,\nthough he happened to be mistaken at this time. He moved that, as our\ncoast was now northward, so we might slant away north-west, that so, by\ncrossing the country, we might perhaps meet with some other river that\nrun into the Rio Grande northward, or down to the Gold Coast southward,\nand so both direct our way and shorten the labour; as also because, if\nany of the country was inhabited and fruitful, we should probably find\nit upon the shore of the rivers, where alone we could be furnished with\nprovisions.\n\nThis was good advice, and too rational not to be taken; but our present\nbusiness was, what to do to get out of this dreadful place we were in.\nBehind us was a waste, which had already cost us five days' march, and\nwe had not provisions for five days left to go back again the same way.\nBefore us was nothing but horror, as above; so we resolved, seeing the\nridge of the hills we were upon had some appearance of fruitfulness,\nand that they seemed to lead away to the northward a great way, to keep\nunder the foot of them on the east side, to go on as far as we could,\nand in the meantime to look diligently out for food.\n\nAccordingly we moved on the next morning; for we had no time to lose,\nand, to our great comfort, we came in our first morning's march to very\ngood springs of fresh water; and lest we should have a scarcity again,\nwe filled all our bladder bottles and carried it with us. I should also\nhave observed that our surgeon, who made the salt water fresh, took the\nopportunity of those salt springs, and made us the quantity of three or\nfour pecks of very good salt.\n\nIn our third march we found an unexpected supply of food, the hills\nbeing full of hares. They were of a kind something different from ours\nin England, larger and not as swift of foot, but very good meat. We shot\nseveral of them, and the little tame leopard, which I told you we took\nat the negro town that we plundered, hunted them like a dog, and killed\nus several every day; but she would eat nothing of them unless we gave\nit her, which, indeed, in our circumstance, was very obliging. We salted\nthem a little and dried them in the sun whole, and carried a strange\nparcel along with us. I think it was almost three hundred, for we did\nnot know when we might find any more, either of these or any other food.\nWe continued our course under these hills very comfortably for eight or\nnine days, when we found, to our great satisfaction, the country beyond\nus began to look with something of a better countenance. As for the west\nside of the hills, we never examined it till this day, when three of our\ncompany, the rest halting for refreshment, mounted the hills again to\nsatisfy their curiosity, but found it all the same, nor could they see\nany end of it, no, not to the north, the way we were going; so the tenth\nday, finding the hills made a turn, and led as it were into the vast\ndesert, we left them and continued our course north, the country being\nvery tolerably full of woods, some waste, but not tediously long, till\nwe came, by our gunner's observation, into the latitude of eight degrees\nfive minutes, which we were nineteen days more in performing.\n\nAll this way we found no inhabitants, but abundance of wild ravenous\ncreatures, with which we became so well acquainted now that really we\ndid not much mind them. We saw lions and tigers and leopards every night\nand morning in abundance; but as they seldom came near us, we let them\ngo about their business: if they offered to come near us, we made false\nfire with any gun that was uncharged, and they would walk off as soon as\nthey saw the flash.\n\nWe made pretty good shift for food all this way; for sometimes we killed\nhares, sometimes some fowls, but for my life I cannot give names to\nany of them, except a kind of partridge, and another that was like our\nturtle. Now and then we began to meet with elephants again in great\nnumbers; those creatures delighted chiefly in the woody part of the\ncountry.\n\nThis long-continued march fatigued us very much, and two of our men fell\nsick, indeed, so very sick that we thought they would have died; and one\nof our negroes died suddenly. Our surgeon said it was an apoplexy, but\nhe wondered at it, he said, for he could never complain of his high\nfeeding. Another of them was very ill; but our surgeon with much ado\npersuading him, indeed it was almost forcing him to be let blood, he\nrecovered.\n\nWe halted here twelve days for the sake of our sick men, and our surgeon\npersuaded me and three or four more of us to be let blood during the\ntime of rest, which, with other things he gave us, contributed very much\nto our continued health in so tedious a march and in so hot a climate.\n\nIn this march we pitched our matted tents every night, and they were\nvery comfortable to us, though we had trees and woods to shelter us in\nmost places. We thought it very strange that in all this part of the\ncountry we yet met with no inhabitants; but the principal reason, as we\nfound afterwards, was, that we, having kept a western course first,\nand then a northern course, were gotten too much into the middle of the\ncountry and among the deserts; whereas the inhabitants are principally\nfound among the rivers, lakes, and lowlands, as well to the south-west\nas to the north.\n\nWhat little rivulets we found here were so empty of water, that except\nsome pits, and little more than ordinary pools, there was scarcely any\nwater to be seen in them; and they rather showed that during the rainy\nmonths they had a channel, than that they had really running water in\nthem at that time, by which it was easy for us to judge that we had a\ngreat way to go; but this was no discouragement so long as we had but\nprovisions, and some seasonable shelter from the violent heat, which\nindeed I thought was much greater now than when the sun was just over\nour heads.\n\nOur men being recovered, we set forward again, very well stored with\nprovisions, and water sufficient, and bending our course a little to\nthe westward of the north, travelled in hopes of some favourable stream\nwhich might bear a canoe; but we found none till after twenty days'\ntravel, including eight days' rest; for our men being weak, we rested\nvery often, especially when we came to places which were proper for our\npurpose, where we found cattle, fowl, or anything to kill for our food.\nIn those twenty days' march we advanced four degrees to the northward,\nbesides some meridian distance westward, and we met with abundance of\nelephants, and with a good number of elephants' teeth scattered up and\ndown, here and there, in the woody grounds especially, some of which\nwere very large. But they were no booty to us; our business was\nprovisions, and a good passage out of the country; and it had been much\nmore to our purpose to have found a good fat deer, and to have killed\nit for our food, than a hundred ton of elephants' teeth; and yet, as\nyou shall presently hear, when we came to begin our passage by water, we\nonce thought to have built a large canoe, on purpose to have loaded it\nwith ivory; but this was when we knew nothing of the rivers, nor knew\nanything how dangerous and how difficult a passage it was we were likely\nto have in them, nor had considered the weight of carriage to lug them\nto the rivers where we might embark.\n\nAt the end of twenty days' travel, as above, in the latitude of three\ndegrees sixteen minutes, we discovered in a valley, at some distance\nfrom us, a pretty tolerable stream, which we thought deserved the name\nof a river, and which ran its course N.N.W., which was just what we\nwanted. As we had fixed our thoughts upon our passage by water, we took\nthis for the place to make the experiment, and bent our march directly\nto the valley.\n\nThere was a small thicket of trees just in our way, which we went by,\nthinking no harm, when on a sudden one of our negroes was dangerously\nwounded with an arrow shot into his back, slanting between his\nshoulders. This put us to a full stop; and three of our men, with two\nnegroes, spreading the wood, for it was but a small one, found a negro\nwith a bow, but no arrow, who would have escaped, but our men that\ndiscovered him shot him in revenge of the mischief he had done; so we\nlost the opportunity of taking him prisoner, which, if we had done, and\nsent him home with good usage, it might have brought others to us in a\nfriendly manner.\n\nGoing a little farther, we came to five negro huts or houses, built\nafter a different manner from any we had seen yet; and at the door of\none of them lay seven elephants' teeth, piled up against the wall or\nside of the hut, as if they had been provided against a market. Here\nwere no men, but seven or eight women, and near twenty children. We\noffered them no incivility of any kind, but gave them every one a bit of\nsilver beaten out thin, as I observed before, and cut diamond fashion,\nor in the shape of a bird, at which the women were overjoyed, and\nbrought out to us several sorts of food, which we did not understand,\nbeing cakes of a meal made of roots, which they bake in the sun, and\nwhich ate very well. We went a little way farther and pitched our camp\nfor that night, not doubting but our civility to the women would produce\nsome good effect when their husbands might come home.\n\nAccordingly, the next morning the women, with eleven men, five young\nboys, and two good big girls, came to our camp. Before they came quite\nto us, the women called aloud, and made an odd screaming noise to bring\nus out; and accordingly we came out, when two of the women, showing us\nwhat we had given them, and pointing to the company behind, made such\nsigns as we could easily understand signified friendship. When the men\nadvanced, having bows and arrows, they laid them down on the ground,\nscraped and threw sand over their heads, and turned round three times\nwith their hands laid up upon the tops of their heads. This, it seems,\nwas a solemn vow of friendship. Upon this we beckoned them with our\nhands to come nearer; then they sent the boys and girls to us first,\nwhich, it seems, was to bring us more cakes of bread and some green\nherbs to eat, which we received, and took the boys up and kissed them,\nand the little girls too; then the men came up close to us, and sat them\ndown on the ground, making signs that we should sit down by them, which\nwe did. They said much to one another, but we could not understand them,\nnor could we find any way to make them understand us, much less\nwhither we were going, or what we wanted, only that we easily made them\nunderstand we wanted victuals; whereupon one of the men, casting his\neyes about him towards a rising ground that was about half a mile off,\nstarted up as if he was frighted, flew to the place where they had laid\ndown their bows and arrows, snatched up a bow and two arrows, and ran\nlike a racehorse to the place. When he came there, he let fly both his\narrows, and comes back again to us with the same speed. We, seeing he\ncame with the bow, but without the arrows, were the more inquisitive;\nbut the fellow, saying nothing to us, beckons to one of our negroes to\ncome to him, and we bid him go; so he led him back to the place, where\nlay a kind of deer, shot with two arrows, but not quite dead, and\nbetween them they brought it down to us. This was for a gift to us, and\nwas very welcome, I assure you, for our stock was low. These people were\nall stark naked.\n\nThe next day there came about a hundred men to us, and women making the\nsame awkward signals of friendship, and dancing, and showing themselves\nvery well pleased, and anything they had they gave us. How the man\nin the wood came to be so butcherly and rude as to shoot at our men,\nwithout making any breach first, we could not imagine; for the people\nwere simple, plain, and inoffensive in all our other conversation with\nthem.\n\nFrom hence we went down the banks of the little river I mentioned, and\nwhere, I found, we should see the whole nation of negroes, but whether\nfriendly to us or not, that we could make no judgment of yet.\n\nThe river was no use to us, as to the design of making canoes, a great\nwhile; and we traversed the country on the edge of it about five days\nmore, when our carpenters, finding the stream increased, proposed to\npitch our tents, and fall to work to make canoes; but after we had begun\nthe work, and cut down two or three trees, and spent five days in the\nlabour, some of our men, wandering further down the river, brought us\nword that the stream rather decreased than increased, sinking away\ninto the sands, or drying up by the heat of the sun, so that the river\nappeared not able to carry the least canoe that could be any way useful\nto us; so we were obliged to give over our enterprise and move on.\n\nIn our further prospect this way, we marched three days full west, the\ncountry on the north side being extraordinary mountainous, and more\nparched and dry than any we had seen yet; whereas, in the part which\nlooks due west, we found a pleasant valley running a great way between\ntwo great ridges of mountains. The hills looked frightful, being\nentirely bare of trees or grass, and even white with the dryness of the\nsand; but in the valley we had trees, grass, and some creatures that\nwere fit for food, and some inhabitants.\n\nWe passed by some of their huts or houses, and saw people about them,\nbut they ran up into the hills as soon as they saw us. At the end of\nthis valley we met with a peopled country, and at first it put us to\nsome doubt whether we should go among them, or keep up towards the hills\nnortherly; and as our aim was principally as before, to make our way to\nthe river Niger, we inclined to the latter, pursuing our course by the\ncompass to the N.W. We marched thus without interruption seven days\nmore, when we met with a surprising circumstance much more desolate and\ndisconsolate than our own, and which, in time to come, will scarce seem\ncredible.\n\nWe did not much seek the conversing, or acquainting ourselves with the\nnatives of the country, except where we found the want of them for our\nprovision, or their direction for our way; so that, whereas we found\nthe country here begin to be very populous, especially towards our left\nhand, that is, to the south, we kept at the more distance northerly,\nstill stretching towards the west.\n\nIn this tract we found something or other to kill and eat, which always\nsupplied our necessity, though not so well as we were provided in our\nfirst setting out; being thus, as it were, pushing to avoid a peopled\ncountry, we at last came to a very pleasant, agreeable stream of water,\nnot big enough to be called a river, but running to the N.N.W., which\nwas the very course we desired to go.\n\nOn the farthest bank of this brook, we perceived some huts of negroes,\nnot many, and in a little low spot of ground, some maize, or Indian\ncorn, growing, which intimated presently to us, that there were some\ninhabitants on that side less barbarous than what we had met with in\nother places where we had been.\n\nAs we went forward, our whole caravan being in a body, our negroes, who\nwere in the front, cried out, that they saw a white man! We were not\nmuch surprised at first, it being, as we thought, a mistake of the\nfellows, and asked them what they meant; when one of them stepped to me,\nand pointing to a hut on the other side of the hill, I was astonished to\nsee a white man indeed, but stark naked, very busy near the door of his\nhut, and stooping down to the ground with something in his hand, as if\nhe had been at some work; and his back being towards us, he did not see\nus.\n\nI gave notice to our negroes to make no noise, and waited till some more\nof our men were come up, to show the sight to them, that they might be\nsure I was not mistaken; and we were soon satisfied of the truth, for\nthe man, having heard some noise, started up, and looked full at us, as\nmuch surprised, to be sure, as we were, but whether with fear or hope,\nwe then knew not.\n\nAs he discovered us, so did the rest of the inhabitants belonging to the\nhuts about him, and all crowded together, looking at us at a distance, a\nlittle bottom, in which the brook ran, lying between us; the white man,\nand all the rest, as he told us afterwards, not knowing well whether\nthey should stay or run away. However, it presently came into my\nthoughts, that if there were white men among them, it would be much\neasier to make them understand what we meant as to peace or war, than\nwe found it with others; so tying a piece of white rag to the end of a\nstick, we sent two negroes with it to the bank of the water, carrying\nthe pole up as high as they could; it was presently understood, and two\nof their men and the white man came to the shore on the other side.\n\nHowever, as the white man spoke no Portuguese, they could understand\nnothing of one another but by signs; but our men made the white man\nunderstand that they had white men with them too, at which they said the\nwhite man laughed. However, to be short, our men came back, and told us\nthey were all good friends, and in about an hour four of our men, two\nnegroes, and the black prince, went to the river-side, where the white\nman came to them.\n\nThey had not been half a quarter of an hour, but a negro came running to\nme, and told me the white man was Inglese, as he called him; upon which\nI ran back, eagerly enough, you may be sure, with him, and found, as\nhe said, that he was an Englishman; upon which he embraced me very\npassionately, the tears running down his face. The first surprise of his\nseeing us was over before we came, but any one may conceive it by the\nbrief account he gave us afterwards of his very unhappy circumstances,\nand of so unexpected a deliverance, such as perhaps never happened to\nany man in the world, for it was a million to one odds that ever he\ncould have been relieved; nothing but an adventure that never was heard\nor read of before could have suited his case, unless Heaven, by some\nmiracle that never was to be expected, had acted for him.\n\nHe appeared to be a gentleman, not an ordinary-bred fellow, seaman, or\nlabouring man; this showed itself in his behaviour in the first moment\nof our conversing with him, and in spite of all the disadvantages of his\nmiserable circumstances.\n\nHe was a middle-aged man, not above thirty-seven or thirty-eight, though\nhis beard was grown exceedingly long, and the hair of his head and\nface strangely covered him to the middle of his back and breast; he was\nwhite, and his skin very fine, though discoloured, and in some places\nblistered, and covered with a brown blackish substance, scurfy, scaly,\nand hard, which was the effect of the scorching heat of the sun; he was\nstark naked, and had been so, as he told us, upwards of two years.\n\nHe was so exceedingly transported at our meeting with him, that he could\nscarce enter into any discourse at all with us that day; and when he\ncould get away from us for a little, we saw him walking alone, and\nshowing all the most extravagant tokens of an ungovernable joy; and even\nafterwards he was never without tears in his eyes for several days,\nupon the least word spoken by us of his circumstances, or by him of his\ndeliverance.\n\nWe found his behaviour the most courteous and endearing I ever saw\nin any man whatever, and most evident tokens of a mannerly, well-bred\nperson appeared in all things he did or said, and our people were\nexceedingly taken with him. He was a scholar and a mathematician; he\ncould not speak Portuguese indeed, but he spoke Latin to our surgeon,\nFrench to another of our men, and Italian to a third.\n\nHe had no leisure in his thoughts to ask us whence we came, whither we\nwere going, or who we were; but would have it always as an answer to\nhimself, that to be sure, wherever we were a-going, we came from Heaven,\nand were sent on purpose to save him from the most wretched condition\nthat ever man was reduced to.\n\nOur men pitching their camp on the bank of a little river opposite to\nhim, he began to inquire what store of provisions we had, and how we\nproposed to be supplied. When he found that our store was but small,\nhe said he would talk with the natives, and we should have provisions\nenough; for he said they were the most courteous, good-natured part of\nthe inhabitants in all that part of the country, as we might suppose by\nhis living so safe among them.\n\nThe first things this gentleman did for us were indeed of the greatest\nconsequence to us; for, first, he perfectly informed us where we were,\nand which was the properest course for us to steer; secondly, he put\nus in the way how to furnish ourselves effectually with provisions; and\nthirdly, he was our complete interpreter and peacemaker with all the\nnatives, who now began to be very numerous about us, and who were a\nmore fierce and politic people than those we had met with before; not so\neasily terrified with our arms as those, and not so ignorant as to give\ntheir provisions and corn for our little toys, such as, I said before,\nour artificer made; but as they had frequently traded and conversed with\nthe Europeans on the coast, or with other negro nations that had traded\nand been concerned with them, they were the less ignorant and the\nless fearful, and consequently nothing was to be had from them but by\nexchange for such things as they liked.\n\nThis I say of the negro natives, which we soon came among; but as to\nthese poor people that he lived among, they were not much acquainted\nwith things, being at the distance of above 300 miles from the coast;\nonly that they found elephants' teeth upon the hills to the north, which\nthey took and carried about sixty or seventy miles south, where other\ntrading negroes usually met them, and gave them beads, glass, shells,\nand cowries, for them, such as the English and Dutch and other traders\nfurnish them with from Europe.\n\nWe now began to be more familiar with our new acquaintance; and first,\nthough we made but a sorry figure as to clothes ourselves, having\nneither shoe, or stocking, or glove, or hat among us, and but very few\nshirts, yet as well as we could we clothed him; and first, our surgeon\nhaving scissors and razors, shaved him, and cut his hair; a hat, as I\nsay, we had not in all our stores, but he supplied himself by making\nhimself a cap of a piece of a leopard-skin, most artificially. As for\nshoes or stockings, he had gone so long without them that he cared not\neven for the buskins and foot-gloves we wore, which I described above.\n\nAs he had been curious to hear the whole story of our travels, and was\nexceedingly delighted with the relation, so we were no less to know, and\npleased with, the account of his circumstances, and the history of his\ncoming to that strange place alone, and in that condition which we found\nhim in, as above. This account of his would indeed be in itself the\nsubject of an agreeable history, and would be as long and diverting as\nour own, having in it many strange and extraordinary incidents; but we\ncannot have room here to launch out into so long a digression: the sum\nof his history was this:--\n\nHe had been a factor for the English Guinea Company at Sierra Leone,\nor some other of their settlements which had been taken by the French,\nwhere he had been plundered of all his own effects, as well as of what\nwas entrusted to him by the company. Whether it was that the company\ndid not do him justice in restoring his circumstances, or in further\nemploying him, he quitted their service, and was employed by those\ncalled separate traders, and being afterwards out of employ there\nalso, traded on his own account; when, passing unwarily into one of the\ncompany's settlements, he was either betrayed into the hands of some of\nthe natives, or, somehow or other, was surprised by them. However, as\nthey did not kill him, he found means to escape from them at that time,\nand fled to another nation of the natives, who, being enemies to the\nother, entertained him friendly, and with them he lived some time; but\nnot liking his quarters or his company, he fled again, and several times\nchanged his landlords: sometimes was carried by force, sometimes\nhurried by fear, as circumstances altered with him (the variety of which\ndeserves a history by itself), till at last he had wandered beyond all\npossibility of return, and had taken up his abode where we found him,\nwhere he was well received by the petty king of the tribe he lived with;\nand he, in return, instructed them how to value the product of their\nlabour, and on what terms to trade with those negroes who came up to\nthem for teeth.\n\nAs he was naked, and had no clothes, so he was naked of arms for his\ndefence, having neither gun, sword, staff, or any instrument of war\nabout him, no, not to guard himself against the attacks of a wild beast,\nof which the country was very full. We asked him how he came to be so\nentirely abandoned of all concern for his safety? He answered, that to\nhim, that had so often wished for death, life was not worth defending;\nand that, as he was entirely at the mercy of the negroes, they had much\nthe more confidence in him, seeing he had no weapons to hurt them. As\nfor wild beasts, he was not much concerned about that, for he scarce\never went from his hut; but if he did, the negro king and his men went\nall with him, and they were all armed with bows and arrows, and lances,\nwith which they would kill any of the ravenous creatures, lions as\nwell as others; but that they seldom came abroad in the day; and if\nthe negroes wander anywhere in the night, they always build a hut for\nthemselves, and make a fire at the door of it, which is guard enough.\n\nWe inquired of him what we should next do towards getting to the\nseaside. He told us we were about one hundred and twenty English leagues\nfrom the coast, where almost all the European settlements and factories\nwere, and which is called the Gold Coast; but that there were so many\ndifferent nations of negroes in the way, that it was ten to one if\nwe were not either fought with continually, or starved for want of\nprovisions; but that there were two other ways to go, which, if he\nhad had any company to go with him, he had often contrived to make his\nescape by. The one was to travel full west, which, though it was farther\nto go, yet was not so full of people, and the people we should find\nwould be so much the civiller to us, or be so much the easier to fight\nwith; or that the other way was, if possible, to get to the Rio Grande,\nand go down the stream in canoes. We told him, that was the way we had\nresolved on before we met with him; but then he told us there was a\nprodigious desert to go over, and as prodigious woods to go through,\nbefore we came to it, and that both together were at least twenty days'\nmarch for us, travel as hard as we could.\n\nWe asked him if there were no horses in the country, or asses, or even\nbullocks or buffaloes, to make use of in such a journey, and we showed\nhim ours, of which we had but three left. He said no, all the country\ndid not afford anything of that kind.\n\nHe told us that in this great wood there were immense numbers of\nelephants; and upon the desert, great multitudes of lions, lynxes,\ntigers, leopards, &c.; and that it was to that wood and that desert that\nthe negroes went to get elephants' teeth, where they never failed to\nfind a great number.\n\nWe inquired still more, and particularly the way to the Gold Coast, and\nif there were no rivers to ease us in our carriage; and told him, as to\nthe negroes fighting with us, we were not much concerned at that; nor\nwere we afraid of starving, for if they had any victuals among them, we\nwould have our share of it; and, therefore, if he would venture to show\nus the way, we would venture to go; and as for himself, we told him we\nwould live and die together--there should not a man of us stir from him.\n\nHe told us, with all his heart, if we resolved it, and would venture, we\nmight be assured he would take his fate with us, and he would endeavour\nto guide us in such a way as we should meet with some friendly savages\nwho would use us well, and perhaps stand by us against some others, who\nwere less tractable; so, in a word, we all resolved to go full south for\nthe Gold Coast.\n\nThe next morning he came to us again, and being all met in council, as\nwe may call it, he began to talk very seriously with us, that since\nwe were now come, after a long journey, to a view of the end of our\ntroubles, and had been so obliging to him as to offer to carry him with\nus, he had been all night revolving in his mind what he and we all might\ndo to make ourselves some amends for all our sorrows; and first, he\nsaid, he was to let me know that we were just then in one of the richest\nparts of the world, though it was really otherwise but a desolate,\ndisconsolate wilderness; \"for,\" says he, \"there is not a river but runs\ngold--not a desert but without ploughing bears a crop of ivory. What\nmines of gold, what immense stores of gold, those mountains may contain,\nfrom whence these rivers come, or the shores which these waters run\nby, we know not, but may imagine that they must be inconceivably rich,\nseeing so much is washed down the stream by the water washing the\nsides of the land, that the quantity suffices all the traders which the\nEuropean world send thither.\" We asked him how far they went for it,\nseeing the ships only trade upon the coast. He told us that the negroes\non the coast search the rivers up for the length of 150 or 200 miles,\nand would be out a month, or two, or three at a time, and always come\nhome sufficiently rewarded; \"but,\" says he, \"they never come thus far,\nand yet hereabouts is as much gold as there.\" Upon this he told us that\nhe believed he might have gotten a hundred pounds' weight of gold since\nhe came thither, if he had employed himself to look and work for it; but\nas he knew not what to do with it, and had long since despaired of being\never delivered from the misery he was in, he had entirely omitted it.\n\"For what advantage had it been to me,\" said he, \"or what richer had\nI been, if I had a ton of gold dust, and lay and wallowed in it? The\nrichness of it,\" said he, \"would not give me one moment's felicity, nor\nrelieve me in the present exigency. Nay,\" says he, \"as you all see, it\nwould not buy me clothes to cover me, or a drop of drink to save me from\nperishing. It is of no value here,\" says he; \"there are several people\namong these huts that would weigh gold against a few glass beads or\na cockle-shell, and give you a handful of gold-dust for a handful\nof cowries.\" N.B.--These are little shells which our children call\nblackamoors' teeth.\n\nWhen he had said thus he pulled out a piece of an earthen pot baked hard\nin the sun. \"Here,\" says he, \"is some of the dirt of this country, and\nif I would I could have got a great deal more;\" and, showing it to us,\nI believe there was in it between two and three pounds weight of\ngold-dust, of the same kind and colour with that we had gotten already,\nas before. After we had looked at it a while, he told us, smiling, we\nwere his deliverers, and all he had, as well as his life, was ours;\nand therefore, as this would be of value to us when we came to our own\ncountry, so he desired we would accept of it among us; and that was the\nonly time that he had repented that he had picked up no more of it.\n\nI spoke for him, as his interpreter, to my comrades, and in their names\nthanked him; but, speaking to them in Portuguese, I desired them to\ndefer the acceptance of his kindness to the next morning; and so I did,\ntelling him we would further talk of this part in the morning; so we\nparted for that time.\n\nWhen he was gone I found they were all wonderfully affected with\nhis discourse, and with the generosity of his temper, as well as\nthe magnificence of his present, which in another place had been\nextraordinary. Upon the whole, not to detain you with circumstances, we\nagreed that, seeing he was now one of our number, and that as we were a\nrelief to him in carrying him out of the dismal condition he was in, so\nhe was equally a relief to us, in being our guide through the rest of\nthe country, our interpreter with the natives, and our director how to\nmanage with the savages, and how to enrich ourselves with the wealth\nof the country; that, therefore, we would put his gold among our common\nstock, and every one should give him as much as would make his up just\nas much as any single share of our own, and for the future we would take\nour lot together, taking his solemn engagement to us, as we had before\none to another, that we would not conceal the least grain of gold we\nfound one from another.\n\nIn the next conference we acquainted him with the adventures of the\nGolden River, and how we had shared what we got there, so that every man\nhad a larger stock than he for his share; that, therefore, instead of\ntaking any from him, we had resolved every one to add a little to him.\nHe appeared very glad that we had met with such good success, but would\nnot take a grain from us, till at last, pressing him very hard, he told\nus, that then he would take it thus:--that, when we came to get any\nmore, he would have so much out of the first as should make him even,\nand then we would go on as equal adventurers; and thus we agreed.\n\nHe then told us he thought it would not be an unprofitable adventure if,\nbefore we set forward, and after we had got a stock of provisions, we\nshould make a journey north to the edge of the desert he had told us of,\nfrom whence our negroes might bring every one a large elephant's tooth,\nand that he would get some more to assist; and that, after a certain\nlength of carriage, they might be conveyed by canoes to the coast, where\nthey would yield a very great profit.\n\nI objected against this on account of our other design we had of getting\ngold-dust; and that our negroes, who we knew would be faithful to us,\nwould get much more by searching the rivers for gold for us than by\nlugging a great tooth of a hundred and fifty pounds weight a hundred\nmiles or more, which would be an insufferable labour to them after so\nhard a journey, and would certainly kill them.\n\nHe acquiesced in the justice of this answer, but fain would have had us\ngone to see the woody part of the hill and the edge of the desert, that\nwe might see how the elephants' teeth lay scattered up and down there;\nbut when we told him the story of what we had seen before, as is said\nabove, he said no more.\n\nWe stayed here twelve days, during which time the natives were very\nobliging to us, and brought us fruits, pompions, and a root like\ncarrots, though of quite another taste, but not unpleasant neither, and\nsome guinea-fowls, whose names we did not know. In short, they brought\nus plenty of what they had, and we lived very well, and we gave them all\nsuch little things as our cutler had made, for he had now a whole bag\nfull of them.\n\nOn the thirteenth day we set forward, taking our new gentleman with us.\nAt parting, the negro king sent two savages with a present to him of\nsome dried flesh, but I do not remember what it was, and he gave him\nagain three silver birds which our cutler helped him to, which I assure\nyou was a present for a king.\n\nWe travelled now south, a little west, and here we found the first\nriver for above 2000 miles' march, whose waters run south, all the rest\nrunning north or west. We followed this river, which was no bigger than\na good large brook in England, till it began to increase its water.\nEvery now and then we found our Englishman went down as it were\nprivately to the water, which was to try the land; at length, after a\nday's march upon this river, he came running up to us with his hands\nfull of sand, and saying, \"Look here.\" Upon looking we found that a good\ndeal of gold lay spangled among the sand of the river. \"Now,\" says he,\n\"I think we may begin to work;\" so he divided our negroes into couples\nand set them to work, to search and wash the sand and ooze in the bottom\nof the water where it was not deep.\n\nIn the first day and a quarter our men all together had gathered a pound\nand two ounces of gold or thereabouts, and as we found the quantity\nincreased the farther we went, we followed it about three days, till\nanother small rivulet joined the first, and then searching up the\nstream, we found gold there too; so we pitched our camp in the angle\nwhere the rivers joined, and we diverted ourselves, as I may call it,\nin washing the gold out of the sand of the river, and in getting\nprovisions.\n\nHere we stayed thirteen days more, in which time we had many pleasant\nadventures with the savages, too long to mention here, and some of them\ntoo homely to tell of, for some of our men had made something free with\ntheir women, which, had not our new guide made peace for us with one of\ntheir men at the price of seven fine bits of silver, which our artificer\nhad cut out into the shapes of lions, and fishes, and birds, and had\npunched holes to hang them up by (an inestimable treasure), we must have\ngone to war with them and all their people.\n\nAll the while we were busy washing gold-dust out of the rivers, and our\nnegroes the like, our ingenious cutler was hammering and cutting, and\nhe was grown so dexterous by use that he formed all manner of images. He\ncut out elephants, tigers, civet cats, ostriches, eagles, cranes, fowls,\nfishes, and indeed whatever he pleased, in thin plates of hammered gold,\nfor his silver and iron were almost all gone.\n\nAt one of the towns of these savage nations we were very friendly\nreceived by their king, and as he was very much taken with our workman's\ntoys, he sold him an elephant cut out of a gold plate as thin as a\nsixpence at an extravagant rate. He was so much taken with it that he\nwould not be quiet till he had given him almost a handful of gold-dust,\nas they call it; I suppose it might weigh three-quarters of a pound; the\npiece of gold that the elephant was made of might be about the weight of\na pistole, rather less than more. Our artist was so honest, though the\nlabour and art were all his own, that he brought all the gold and put\nit into our common stock; but we had, indeed, no manner of reason in the\nleast to be covetous, for, as our new guide told us, we that were strong\nenough to defend ourselves, and had time enough to stay (for we were\nnone of us in haste), might in time get together what quantity of gold\nwe pleased, even to an hundred pounds weight each man if we thought fit;\nand therefore he told us, though he had as much reason to be sick of the\ncountry as any of us, yet if we thought to turn our march a little to\nthe south-east, and pitch upon a place proper for our headquarters,\nwe might find provisions plenty enough, and extend ourselves over the\ncountry among the rivers for two or three years to the right and left,\nand we should soon find the advantage of it.\n\nThe proposal, however good as to the profitable part of it, suited none\nof us, for we were all more desirous to get home than to be rich, being\ntired of the excessive fatigue of above a year's continual wandering\namong deserts and wild beasts.\n\nHowever, the tongue of our new acquaintance had a kind of charm in it,\nand used such arguments, and had so much the power of persuasion, that\nthere was no resisting him. He told us it was preposterous not to take\nthe fruit of all our labours now we were come to the harvest; that we\nmight see the hazard the Europeans run with ships and men, and at great\nexpense, to fetch a little gold, and that we, that were in the centre\nof it, to go away empty-handed was unaccountable; that we were strong\nenough to fight our way through whole nations, and might make our\njourney afterward to what part of the coast we pleased, and we should\nnever forgive ourselves when we came to our own country to see we had\n500 pistoles in gold, and might as easily have had 5000 or 10,000, or\nwhat we pleased; that he was no more covetous than we, but seeing it\nwas in all our powers to retrieve our misfortunes at once, and to make\nourselves easy for all our lives, he could not be faithful to us, or\ngrateful for the good we had done him, if he did not let us see the\nadvantage we had in our hands; and he assured us he would make it clear\nto our own understanding, that we might in two years' time, by good\nmanagement and by the help of our negroes, gather every man a hundred\npounds weight of gold, and get together perhaps two hundred ton of\nteeth; whereas, if once we pushed on to the coast and separated, we\nshould never be able to see that place again with our eyes, or do any\nmore than sinners did with heaven,--wish themselves there, but know they\ncan never come at it.\n\nOur surgeon was the first man that yielded to his reasoning, and after\nhim the gunner; and they too, indeed, had a great influence over us, but\nnone of the rest had any mind to stay, nor I neither, I must confess;\nfor I had no notion of a great deal of money, or what to do with myself,\nor what to do with it if I had it. I thought I had enough already, and\nall the thoughts I had about disposing of it, if I came to Europe, was\nonly how to spend it as fast as I could, buy me some clothes, and go to\nsea again to be a drudge for more.\n\nHowever, he prevailed with us by his good words at last to stay but for\nsix months in the country, and then, if we did resolve to go, he would\nsubmit; so at length we yielded to that, and he carried us about fifty\nEnglish miles south-east, where we found several rivulets of water,\nwhich seemed to come all from a great ridge of mountains, which lay to\nthe north-east, and which, by our calculation, must be the beginning\nthat way of the great waste, which we had been forced northward to\navoid.\n\nHere we found the country barren enough, but yet we had by his direction\nplenty of food; for the savages round us, upon giving them some of our\ntoys, as I have so often mentioned, brought us in whatever they had;\nand here we found some maize, or Indian wheat, which the negro women\nplanted, as we sow seeds in a garden, and immediately our new provider\nordered some of our negroes to plant it, and it grew up presently, and\nby watering it often, we had a crop in less than three months' growth.\n\nAs soon as we were settled, and our camp fixed, we fell to the old\ntrade of fishing for gold in the rivers mentioned above, and our English\ngentleman so well knew how to direct our search, that we scarce ever\nlost our labour.\n\nOne time, having set us to work, he asked if we would give him leave,\nwith four or five negroes, to go out for six or seven days to seek his\nfortune, and see what he could discover in the country, assuring us\nwhatever he got should be for the public stock. We all gave him our\nconsent, and lent him a gun; and two of our men desiring to go with him,\nthey took then six negroes with them, and two of our buffaloes that\ncame with us the whole journey; they took about eight days' provision of\nbread with them, but no flesh, except about as much dried flesh as would\nserve them two days.\n\nThey travelled up to the top of the mountains I mentioned just now,\nwhere they saw (as our men afterwards vouched it to be) the same desert\nwhich we were so justly terrified at when we were on the farther side,\nand which, by our calculation, could not be less than 300 miles broad\nand above 600 miles in length, without knowing where it ended.\n\nThe journal of their travels is too long to enter upon here. They\nstayed out two-and-fifty days, when they brought us seventeen pound and\nsomething more (for we had no exact weight) of gold-dust, some of it in\nmuch larger pieces than any we had found before, besides about fifteen\nton of elephants' teeth, which he had, partly by good usage and partly\nby bad, obliged the savages of the country to fetch, and bring down to\nhim from the mountains, and which he made others bring with him quite\ndown to our camp. Indeed, we wondered what was coming to us when we saw\nhim attended with above 200 negroes; but he soon undeceived us, when he\nmade them all throw down their burdens on a heap at the entrance of our\ncamp.\n\nBesides this, they brought two lions' skins, and five leopards' skins,\nvery large and very fine. He asked our pardon for his long stay, and\nthat he had made no greater a booty, but told us he had one excursion\nmore to make, which he hoped should turn to a better account.\n\nSo, having rested himself and rewarded the savages that brought the\nteeth for him with some bits of silver and iron cut out diamond fashion,\nand with two shaped like little dogs, he sent them away mightily\npleased.\n\nThe second journey he went, some more of our men desired to go with\nhim, and they made a troop of ten white men and ten savages, and the two\nbuffaloes to carry their provisions and ammunition. They took the same\ncourse, only not exactly the same track, and they stayed thirty-two days\nonly, in which time they killed no less than fifteen leopards, three\nlions, and several other creatures, and brought us home four-and-twenty\npound some ounces of gold-dust, and only six elephants' teeth, but they\nwere very great ones.\n\nOur friend the Englishman showed us that now our time was well bestowed,\nfor in five months which we had stayed here, we had gathered so much\ngold-dust that, when we came to share it, we had five pound and a\nquarter to a man, besides what we had before, and besides six or seven\npound weight which we had at several times given our artificer to make\nbaubles with. And now we talked of going forward to the coast to put an\nend to our journey; but our guide laughed at us then. \"Nay, you can't go\nnow,\" says he, \"for the rainy season begins next month, and there will\nbe no stirring then.\" This we found, indeed, reasonable, so we resolved\nto furnish ourselves with provisions, that we might not be obliged to\ngo abroad too much in the rain, and we spread ourselves some one way and\nsome another, as far as we cared to venture, to get provisions; and our\nnegroes killed us some deer, which we cured as well as we could in the\nsun, for we had now no salt.\n\nBy this time the rainy months were set in, and we could scarce, for\nabove two months, look out of our huts. But that was not all, for the\nrivers were so swelled with the land-floods, that we scarce knew the\nlittle brooks and rivulets from the great navigable rivers. This had\nbeen a very good opportunity to have conveyed by water, upon rafts, our\nelephants' teeth, of which we had a very great pile; for, as we always\ngave the savages some reward for their labour, the very women would\nbring us teeth upon every opportunity, and sometimes a great tooth\ncarried between two; so that our quantity was increased to about\ntwo-and-twenty ton of teeth.\n\nAs soon as the weather proved fair again, he told us he would not press\nus to any further stay, since we did not care whether we got any more\ngold or no; that we were indeed the first men he ever met with in his\nlife that said they had gold enough, and of whom it might be truly said,\nthat, when it lay under our feet, we would not stoop to take it up. But,\nsince he had made us a promise, he would not break it, nor press us to\nmake any further stay; only he thought he ought to tell us that now was\nthe time, after the land-flood, when the greatest quantity of gold was\nfound; and that, if we stayed but one month, we should see thousands of\nsavages spread themselves over the whole country to wash the gold out\nof the sand, for the European ships which would come on the coast; that\nthey do it then, because the rage of the floods always works down a\ngreat deal of gold out of the hills; and, if we took the advantage to\nbe there before them, we did not know what extraordinary things we might\nfind.\n\nThis was so forcible, and so well argued, that it appeared in all our\nfaces we were prevailed upon; so we told him we would all stay: for\nthough it was true we were all eager to be gone, yet the evident\nprospect of so much advantage could not well be resisted; that he was\ngreatly mistaken, when he suggested that we did not desire to increase\nour store of gold, and in that we were resolved to make the utmost use\nof the advantage that was in our hands, and would stay as long as any\ngold was to be had, if it was another year.\n\nHe could hardly express the joy he was in on this occasion; and the fair\nweather coming on, we began, just as he directed, to search about the\nrivers for more gold. At first we had but little encouragement, and\nbegan to be doubtful; but it was very plain that the reason was,\nthe water was not fully fallen, or the rivers reduced to their usual\nchannel; but in a few days we were fully requited, and found much more\ngold than at first, and in bigger lumps; and one of our men washed out\nof the sand a piece of gold as big as a small nut, which weighed, by our\nestimation--for we had no small weights--almost an ounce and a half.\n\nThis success made us extremely diligent; and in little more than a month\nwe had altogether gotten near sixty pound weight of gold; but after\nthis, as he told us, we found abundance of the savages, men, women, and\nchildren, hunting every river and brook, and even the dry land of the\nhills for gold; so that we could do nothing like then, compared to what\nwe had done before.\n\nBut our artificer found a way to make other people find us in gold\nwithout our own labour; for, when these people began to appear, he had\na considerable quantity of his toys, birds, beasts, &c., such as before,\nready for them; and the English gentleman being the interpreter, he\nbrought the savages to admire them; so our cutler had trade enough,\nand, to be sure, sold his goods at a monstrous rate; for he would get an\nounce of gold, sometimes two, for a bit of silver, perhaps of the value\nof a groat; nay, if it were iron and if it was of gold, they would\nnot give the more for it; and it was incredible almost to think what a\nquantity of gold he got that way.\n\nIn a word, to bring this happy journey to a conclusion, we increased our\nstock of gold here, in three months' stay more, to such a degree that,\nbringing it all to a common stock, in order to share it, we divided\nalmost four pound weight again to every man; and then we set forward\nfor the Gold Coast, to see what method we could find out for our passage\ninto Europe.\n\nThere happened several remarkable incidents in this part of our journey,\nas to how we were, or were not, received friendly by the several nations\nof savages through which we passed; how we delivered one negro king\nfrom captivity, who had been a benefactor to our new guide; and now our\nguide, in gratitude, by our assistance, restored him to his kingdom,\nwhich, perhaps, might contain about 300 subjects; how he entertained us;\nand how he made his subjects go with our Englishmen, and fetch all our\nelephants' teeth which we had been obliged to leave behind us, and to\ncarry them for us to the river, the name of which I forgot, where\nwe made rafts, and in eleven days more came down to one of the Dutch\nsettlements on the Gold Coast, where we arrived in perfect health, and\nto our great satisfaction. As for our cargo of teeth, we sold it to the\nDutch factory, and received clothes and other necessaries for ourselves,\nand such of our negroes as we thought fit to keep with us; and it is to\nbe observed, that we had four pound of gunpowder left when we ended our\njourney. The negro prince we made perfectly free, clothed him out of our\ncommon stock, and gave him a pound and a half of gold for himself, which\nhe knew very well how to manage; and here we all parted after the most\nfriendly manner possible. Our Englishman remained in the Dutch factory\nsome time, and, as I heard afterwards, died there of grief; for he\nhaving sent a thousand pounds sterling over to England, by the way of\nHolland, for his refuge at his return to his friends, the ship was taken\nby the French and the effects all lost.\n\nThe rest of my comrades went away, in a small bark, to the two\nPortuguese factories, near Gambia, in the latitude of fourteen; and I,\nwith two negroes which I kept with me, went away to Cape Coast Castle,\nwhere I got passage for England, and arrived there in September; and\nthus ended my first harvest of wild oats; the rest were not sowed to so\nmuch advantage.\n\nI had neither friend, relation, nor acquaintance in England, though it\nwas my native country; I had consequently no person to trust with what\nI had, or to counsel me to secure or save it; but, falling into ill\ncompany, and trusting the keeper of a public-house in Rotherhithe with a\ngreat part of my money, and hastily squandering away the rest, all that\ngreat sum, which I got with so much pains and hazard, was gone in little\nmore than two years' time; and, as I even rage in my own thoughts to\nreflect upon the manner how it was wasted, so I need record no more; the\nrest merits to be concealed with blushes, for that it was spent in all\nkinds of folly and wickedness. So this scene of my life may be said to\nhave begun in theft, and ended in luxury; a sad setting-out, and a worse\ncoming home.\n\nAbout the year ---- I began to see the bottom of my stock, and that\nit was time to think of further adventures; for my spoilers, as I call\nthem, began to let me know, that as my money declined, their respect\nwould ebb with it, and that I had nothing to expect of them further than\nas I might command it by the force of my money, which, in short, would\nnot go an inch the further for all that had been spent in their favour\nbefore.\n\nThis shocked me very much, and I conceived a just abhorrence of their\ningratitude; but it wore off; nor had I met with any regret at the\nwasting so glorious a sum of money as I brought to England with me.\n\nI next shipped myself, in an evil hour to be sure, on a voyage to Cadiz,\nin a ship called the ----, and in the course of our voyage, being on the\ncoast of Spain, was obliged to put into the Groyn, by a strong southwest\nwind.\n\nHere I fell into company with some masters of mischief; and, among them,\none, forwarder than the rest, began an intimate confidence with me,\nso that we called one another brothers, and communicated all our\ncircumstances to one another. His name was Harris. This fellow came to\nme one morning, asking me if I would go on shore, and I agreed; so we\ngot the captain's leave for the boat, and went together. When we were\ntogether, he asked me if I had a mind for an adventure that might make\namends for all past misfortunes. I told him, yes, with all my heart; for\nI did not care where I went, having nothing to lose, and no one to leave\nbehind me.\n\nHe then asked me if I would swear to be secret, and that, if I did not\nagree to what he proposed, I would nevertheless never betray him. I\nreadily bound myself to that, upon the most solemn imprecations and\ncurses that the devil and both of us could invent.\n\nHe told me, then, there was a brave fellow in the other ship, pointing\nto another English ship which rode in the harbour, who, in concert with\nsome of the men, had resolved to mutiny the next morning, and run away\nwith the ship; and that, if we could get strength enough among our\nship's company, we might do the same. I liked the proposal very well,\nand he got eight of us to join with him, and he told us, that as soon as\nhis friend had begun the work, and was master of the ship, we should\nbe ready to do the like. This was his plot; and I, without the least\nhesitation, either at the villainy of the fact or the difficulty of\nperforming it, came immediately into the wicked conspiracy, and so it\nwent on among us; but we could not bring our part to perfection.\n\nAccordingly, on the day appointed, his correspondent in the other ship,\nwhose name was Wilmot, began the work, and, having seized the captain's\nmate and other officers, secured the ship, and gave the signal to us.\nWe were but eleven in our ship, who were in the conspiracy, nor could we\nget any more that we could trust; so that, leaving the ship, we all took\nthe boat, and went off to join the other.\n\nHaving thus left the ship I was in, we were entertained with a great\ndeal of joy by Captain Wilmot and his new gang; and, being well prepared\nfor all manner of roguery, bold, desperate (I mean myself), without the\nleast checks of conscience for what I was entered upon, or for anything\nI might do, much less with any apprehension of what might be the\nconsequence of it; I say, having thus embarked with this crew, which at\nlast brought me to consort with the most famous pirates of the age, some\nof whom have ended their journals at the gallows, I think the giving\nan account of some of my other adventures may be an agreeable piece\nof story; and this I may venture to say beforehand, upon the word of a\npirate, that I shall not be able to recollect the full, no, not by far,\nof the great variety which has formed one of the most reprobate schemes\nthat ever man was capable to present to the world.\n\nI that was, as I have hinted before, an original thief, and a pirate,\neven by inclination before, was now in my element, and never undertook\nanything in my life with more particular satisfaction.\n\nCaptain Wilmot (for so we are now to call him) being thus possessed of a\nship, and in the manner as you have heard, it may be easily concluded\nhe had nothing to do to stay in the port, or to wait either the attempts\nthat might be made from the shore, or any change that might happen among\nhis men. On the contrary, we weighed anchor the same tide, and stood out\nto sea, steering away for the Canaries. Our ship had twenty-two guns,\nbut was able to carry thirty; and besides, as she was fitted out for\na merchant-ship only, she was not furnished either with ammunition or\nsmall-arms sufficient for our design, or for the occasion we might have\nin case of a fight. So we put into Cadiz, that is to say, we came to an\nanchor in the bay; and the captain, and one whom we called young Captain\nKidd, who was the gunner, [landed,] and some of the men who could best\nbe trusted, among whom was my comrade Harris, who was made second mate,\nand myself, who was made a lieutenant. Some bales of English goods were\nproposed to be carried on shore with us for sale, but my comrade, who\nwas a complete fellow at his business, proposed a better way for it;\nand having been in the town before, told us, in short, that he would buy\nwhat powder and bullet, small-arms, or anything else we wanted, on his\nown word, to be paid for when they came on board, in such English goods\nas we had there. This was much the best way, and accordingly he and the\ncaptain went on shore by themselves, and having made such a bargain\nas they found for their turn, came away again in two hours' time, and\nbringing only a butt of wine and five casks of brandy with them, we all\nwent on board again.\n\nThe next morning two _barcos longos_ came off to us, deeply laden, with\nfive Spaniards on board them, for traffic. Our captain sold them good\npennyworths, and they delivered us sixteen barrels of powder, twelve\nsmall rundlets of fine powder for our small-arms, sixty muskets, and\ntwelve fuzees for the officers; seventeen ton of cannon-ball, fifteen\nbarrels of musket-bullets, with some swords and twenty good pair of\npistols. Besides this, they brought thirteen butts of wine (for we, that\nwere now all become gentlemen, scorned to drink the ship's beer), also\nsixteen puncheons of brandy, with twelve barrels of raisins and twenty\nchests of lemons; all which we paid for in English goods; and, over and\nabove, the captain received six hundred pieces of eight in money. They\nwould have come again, but we would stay no longer.\n\nFrom hence we sailed to the Canaries, and from thence onward to the\nWest Indies, where we committed some depredation upon the Spaniards for\nprovisions, and took some prizes, but none of any great value, while I\nremained with them, which was not long at that time; for, having taken a\nSpanish sloop on the coast of Carthagena, my friend made a motion to me,\nthat we should desire Captain Wilmot to put us into the sloop, with a\nproportion of arms and ammunition, and let us try what we could do; she\nbeing much fitter for our business than the great ship, and a better\nsailer. This he consented to, and we appointed our rendezvous at Tobago,\nmaking an agreement, that whatever was taken by either of our ships\nshould be shared among the ship's company of both; all which we very\npunctually observed, and joined our ships again, about fifteen months\nafter, at the island of Tobago, as above.\n\nWe cruised near two years in those seas, chiefly upon the Spaniards;\nnot that we made any difficulty of taking English ships, or Dutch,\nor French, if they came in our way; and particularly, Captain Wilmot\nattacked a New England ship bound from the Madeiras to Jamaica, and\nanother bound from New York to Barbados, with provisions; which last was\na very happy supply to us. But the reason why we meddled as little with\nEnglish vessels as we could, was, first, because, if they were ships\nof any force, we were sure of more resistance from them; and, secondly,\nbecause we found the English ships had less booty when taken, for the\nSpaniards generally had money on board, and that was what we best knew\nwhat to do with. Captain Wilmot was, indeed, more particularly cruel\nwhen he took any English vessel, that they might not too soon have\nadvice of him in England; and so the men-of-war have orders to look out\nfor him. But this part I bury in silence for the present.\n\nWe increased our stock in these two years considerably, having taken\n60,000 pieces of eight in one vessel, and 100,000 in another; and being\nthus first grown rich, we resolved to be strong too, for we had taken a\nbrigantine built at Virginia, an excellent sea-boat, and a good sailer,\nand able to carry twelve guns; and a large Spanish frigate-built ship,\nthat sailed incomparably well also, and which afterwards, by the help\nof good carpenters, we fitted up to carry twenty-eight guns. And now we\nwanted more hands, so we put away for the Bay of Campeachy, not doubting\nwe should ship as many men there as we pleased; and so we did.\n\nHere we sold the sloop that I was in; and Captain Wilmot keeping his\nown ship, I took the command of the Spanish frigate as captain, and my\ncomrade Harris as eldest lieutenant, and a bold enterprising fellow\nhe was, as any the world afforded. One culverdine was put into the\nbrigantine, so that we were now three stout ships, well manned, and\nvictualled for twelve months; for we had taken two or three sloops from\nNew England and New York, laden with flour, peas, and barrelled beef and\npork, going for Jamaica and Barbados; and for more beef we went on\nshore on the island of Cuba, where we killed as many black cattle as we\npleased, though we had very little salt to cure them.\n\nOut of all the prizes we took here we took their powder and bullet,\ntheir small-arms and cutlasses; and as for their men, we always took the\nsurgeon and the carpenter, as persons who were of particular use to\nus upon many occasions; nor were they always unwilling to go with us,\nthough for their own security, in case of accidents, they might easily\npretend they were carried away by force; of which I shall give a\npleasant account in the course of my other expeditions.\n\nWe had one very merry fellow here, a Quaker, whose name was William\nWalters, whom we took out of a sloop bound from Pennsylvania to\nBarbados. He was a surgeon, and they called him doctor; but he was not\nemployed in the sloop as a surgeon, but was going to Barbados to get a\nberth, as the sailors call it. However, he had all his surgeon's chests\non board, and we made him go with us, and take all his implements with\nhim. He was a comic fellow indeed, a man of very good solid sense, and\nan excellent surgeon; but, what was worth all, very good-humoured and\npleasant in his conversation, and a bold, stout, brave fellow too, as\nany we had among us.\n\nI found William, as I thought, not very averse to go along with us, and\nyet resolved to do it so that it might be apparent he was taken away\nby force, and to this purpose he comes to me. \"Friend,\" says he, \"thou\nsayest I must go with thee, and it is not in my power to resist thee if\nI would; but I desire thou wilt oblige the master of the sloop which I\nam on board to certify under his hand, that I was taken away by force\nand against my will.\" And this he said with so much satisfaction in his\nface, that I could not but understand him. \"Ay, ay,\" says I, \"whether\nit be against your will or no, I'll make him and all the men give you\na certificate of it, or I'll take them all along with us, and keep them\ntill they do.\" So I drew up a certificate myself, wherein I wrote that\nhe was taken away by main force, as a prisoner, by a pirate ship; that\nthey carried away his chest and instruments first, and then bound his\nhands behind him and forced him into their boat; and this was signed by\nthe master and all his men.\n\nAccordingly I fell a-swearing at him, and called to my men to tie his\nhands behind him, and so we put him into our boat and carried him away.\nWhen I had him on board, I called him to me. \"Now, friend,\" says I, \"I\nhave brought you away by force, it is true, but I am not of the opinion\nI have brought you away so much against your will as they imagine.\nCome,\" says I, \"you will be a useful man to us, and you shall have very\ngood usage among us.\" So I unbound his hands, and first ordered all\nthings that belonged to him to be restored to him, and our captain gave\nhim a dram.\n\n\"Thou hast dealt friendly by me,\" says he, \"and I will be plain with\nthee, whether I came willingly to thee or not. I shall make myself\nas useful to thee as I can, but thou knowest it is not my business to\nmeddle when thou art to fight.\" \"No, no,\" says the captain, \"but you may\nmeddle a little when we share the money.\" \"Those things are useful to\nfurnish a surgeon's chest,\" says William, and smiled, \"but I shall be\nmoderate.\"\n\nIn short, William was a most agreeable companion; but he had the better\nof us in this part, that if we were taken we were sure to be hanged, and\nhe was sure to escape; and he knew it well enough. But, in short, he\nwas a sprightly fellow, and fitter to be captain than any of us. I shall\nhave often an occasion to speak of him in the rest of the story.\n\nOur cruising so long in these seas began now to be so well known, that\nnot in England only, but in France and Spain, accounts had been made\npublic of our adventures, and many stories told how we murdered the\npeople in cold blood, tying them back to back, and throwing them into\nthe sea; one half of which, however, was not true, though more was done\nthan is fit to speak of here.\n\nThe consequence of this, however, was, that several English men-of-war\nwere sent to the West Indies, and were particularly instructed to cruise\nin the Bay of Mexico, and the Gulf of Florida, and among the Bahama\nislands, if possible, to attack us. We were not so ignorant of things as\nnot to expect this, after so long a stay in that part of the world; but\nthe first certain account we had of them was at Honduras, when a vessel\ncoming in from Jamaica told us that two English men-of-war were coming\ndirectly from Jamaica thither in quest of us. We were indeed as it were\nembayed, and could not have made the least shift to have got off, if\nthey had come directly to us; but, as it happened, somebody had informed\nthem that we were in the Bay of Campeachy, and they went directly\nthither, by which we were not only free of them, but were so much to the\nwindward of them, that they could not make any attempt upon us, though\nthey had known we were there.\n\nWe took this advantage, and stood away for Carthagena, and from thence\nwith great difficulty beat it up at a distance from under the shore for\nSt. Martha, till we came to the Dutch island of Curacoa, and from thence\nto the island of Tobago, which, as before, was our rendezvous; which,\nbeing a deserted, uninhabited island, we at the same time made use of\nfor a retreat. Here the captain of the brigantine died, and Captain\nHarris, at that time my lieutenant, took the command of the brigantine.\n\nHere we came to a resolution to go away to the coast of Brazil, and from\nthence to the Cape of Good Hope, and so for the East Indies; but Captain\nHarris, as I have said, being now captain of the brigantine, alleged\nthat his ship was too small for so long a voyage, but that, if Captain\nWilmot would consent, he would take the hazard of another cruise, and\nhe would follow us in the first ship he could take. So we appointed our\nrendezvous to be at Madagascar, which was done by my recommendation of\nthe place, and the plenty of provisions to be had there.\n\nAccordingly, he went away from us in an evil hour; for, instead of\ntaking a ship to follow us, he was taken, as I heard afterwards, by\nan English man-of-war, and being laid in irons, died of mere grief\nand anger before he came to England. His lieutenant, I have heard, was\nafterwards executed in England for a pirate; and this was the end of the\nman who first brought me into this unhappy trade.\n\nWe parted from Tobago three days after, bending our course for the coast\nof Brazil, but had not been at sea above twenty-four hours, when we were\nseparated by a terrible storm, which held three days, with very little\nabatement or intermission. In this juncture Captain Wilmot happened,\nunluckily, to be on board my ship, to his great mortification; for we\nnot only lost sight of his ship, but never saw her more till we came\nto Madagascar, where she was cast away. In short, after having in this\ntempest lost our fore-topmast, we were forced to put back to the isle of\nTobago for shelter, and to repair our damage, which brought us all very\nnear our destruction.\n\nWe were no sooner on shore here, and all very busy looking out for a\npiece of timber for a topmast, but we perceived standing in for the\nshore an English man-of-war of thirty-six guns. It was a great surprise\nto us indeed, because we were disabled so much; but, to our great good\nfortune, we lay pretty snug and close among the high rocks, and the\nman-of-war did not see us, but stood off again upon his cruise. So\nwe only observed which way she went, and at night, leaving our work,\nresolved to stand off to sea, steering the contrary way from that which\nwe observed she went; and this, we found, had the desired success, for\nwe saw him no more. We had gotten an old mizzen-topmast on board, which\nmade us a jury fore-topmast for the present; and so we stood away for\nthe isle of Trinidad, where, though there were Spaniards on shore, yet\nwe landed some men with our boat, and cut a very good piece of fir to\nmake us a new topmast, which we got fitted up effectually; and also we\ngot some cattle here to eke out our provisions; and calling a council of\nwar among ourselves, we resolved to quit those seas for the present, and\nsteer away for the coast of Brazil.\n\nThe first thing we attempted here was only getting fresh water, but we\nlearnt that there lay the Portuguese fleet at the bay of All Saints,\nbound for Lisbon, ready to sail, and only waited for a fair wind. This\nmade us lie by, wishing to see them put to sea, and, accordingly as they\nwere with or without convoy, to attack or avoid them.\n\nIt sprung up a fresh gale in the evening at S.W. by W., which, being\nfair for the Portugal fleet, and the weather pleasant and agreeable,\nwe heard the signal given to unmoor, and running in under the island of\nSi---, we hauled our mainsail and foresail up in the brails, lowered the\ntopsails upon the cap, and clewed them up, that we might lie as snug as\nwe could, expecting their coming out, and the next morning saw the whole\nfleet come out accordingly, but not at all to our satisfaction, for they\nconsisted of twenty-six sail, and most of them ships of force, as well\nas burthen, both merchantmen and men-of-war; so, seeing there was no\nmeddling, we lay still where we were also, till the fleet was out of\nsight, and then stood off and on, in hopes of meeting with further\npurchase.\n\nIt was not long before we saw a sail, and immediately gave her chase;\nbut she proved an excellent sailer, and, standing out to sea, we saw\nplainly she trusted to her heels--that is to say, to her sails. However,\nas we were a clean ship, we gained upon her, though slowly, and had we\nhad a day before us, we should certainly have come up with her; but it\ngrew dark apace, and in that case we knew we should lose sight of her.\n\nOur merry Quaker, perceiving us to crowd still after her in the dark,\nwherein we could not see which way she went, came very dryly to me.\n\"Friend Singleton,\" says he, \"dost thee know what we are a-doing?\" Says\nI, \"Yes; why, we are chasing yon ship, are we not?\" \"And how dost thou\nknow that?\" says he, very gravely still. \"Nay, that's true,\" says I\nagain; \"we cannot be sure.\" \"Yes, friend,\" says he, \"I think we may be\nsure that we are running away from her, not chasing her. I am afraid,\"\nadds he, \"thou art turned Quaker, and hast resolved not to use the hand\nof power, or art a coward, and art flying from thy enemy.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" says I (I think I swore at him). \"What do you sneer\nat now? You have always one dry rub or another to give us.\"\n\n\"Nay,\" says he, \"it is plain enough the ship stood off to sea due east,\non purpose to lose us, and thou mayest be sure her business does not\nlie that way; for what should she do at the coast of Africa in this\nlatitude, which should be as far south as Congo or Angola? But as soon\nas it is dark, that we would lose sight of her, she will tack and stand\naway west again for the Brazil coast and for the bay, where thou knowest\nshe was going before; and are we not, then, running away from her? I\nam greatly in hopes, friend,\" says the dry, gibing creature, \"thou wilt\nturn Quaker, for I see thou art not for fighting.\"\n\n\"Very well, William,\" says I; \"then I shall make an excellent pirate.\"\nHowever, William was in the right, and I apprehended what he meant\nimmediately; and Captain Wilmot, who lay very sick in his cabin,\noverhearing us, understood him as well as I, and called out to me that\nWilliam was right, and it was our best way to change our course, and\nstand away for the bay, where it was ten to one but we should snap her\nin the morning.\n\nAccordingly we went about-ship, got our larboard tacks on board, set the\ntop-gallant sails, and crowded for the bay of All Saints, where we came\nto an anchor early in the morning, just out of gunshot of the forts;\nwe furled our sails with rope-yarns, that we might haul home the sheets\nwithout going up to loose them, and, lowering our main and fore-yards,\nlooked just as if we had lain there a good while.\n\nIn two hours afterwards we saw our game standing in for the bay with all\nthe sail she could make, and she came innocently into our very mouths,\nfor we lay still till we saw her almost within gunshot, when, our\nforemost gears being stretched fore and aft, we first ran up our yards,\nand then hauled home the topsail sheets, the rope-yarns that furled them\ngiving way of themselves; the sails were set in a few minutes; at the\nsame time slipping our cable, we came upon her before she could get\nunder way upon the other tack. They were so surprised that they made\nlittle or no resistance, but struck after the first broadside.\n\nWe were considering what to do with her, when William came to me. \"Hark\nthee, friend,\" says he, \"thou hast made a fine piece of work of it\nnow, hast thou not, to borrow thy neighbour's ship here just at thy\nneighbour's door, and never ask him leave? Now, dost thou not think\nthere are some men-of-war in the port? Thou hast given them the alarm\nsufficiently; thou wilt have them upon thy back before night, depend\nupon it, to ask thee wherefore thou didst so.\"\n\n\"Truly, William,\" said I, \"for aught I know, that may be true; what,\nthen, shall we do next?\" Says he, \"Thou hast but two things to do:\neither to go in and take all the rest, or else get thee gone before they\ncome out and take thee; for I see they are hoisting a topmast to yon\ngreat ship, in order to put to sea immediately, and they won't be long\nbefore they come to talk with thee, and what wilt thou say to them when\nthey ask thee why thou borrowedst their ship without leave?\"\n\nAs William said, so it was. We could see by our glasses they were all\nin a hurry, manning and fitting some sloops they had there, and a large\nman-of-war, and it was plain they would soon be with us. But we were\nnot at a loss what to do; we found the ship we had taken was laden with\nnothing considerable for our purpose, except some cocoa, some sugar, and\ntwenty barrels of flour; the rest of her cargo was hides; so we took\nout all we thought fit for our turn, and, among the rest, all her\nammunition, great shot, and small-arms, and turned her off. We also took\na cable and three anchors she had, which were for our purpose, and some\nof her sails. She had enough left just to carry her into port, and that\nwas all.\n\nHaving done this, we stood on upon the Brazil coast, southward, till we\ncame to the mouth of the river Janeiro. But as we had two days the wind\nblowing hard at S.E. and S.S.E., we were obliged to come to an anchor\nunder a little island, and wait for a wind. In this time the Portuguese\nhad, it seems, given notice over land to the governor there, that a\npirate was upon the coast; so that, when we came in view of the port, we\nsaw two men-of-war riding just without the bar, whereof one, we found,\nwas getting under sail with all possible speed, having slipped her\ncable on purpose to speak with us; the other was not so forward, but was\npreparing to follow. In less than an hour they stood both fair after us,\nwith all the sail they could make.\n\nHad not the night come on, William's words had been made good; they\nwould certainly have asked us the question what we did there, for we\nfound the foremost ship gained upon us, especially upon one tack, for we\nplied away from them to windward; but in the dark losing sight of them,\nwe resolved to change our course and stand away directly for sea, not\ndoubting that we should lose them in the night.\n\nWhether the Portuguese commander guessed we would do so or no, I know\nnot; but in the morning, when the daylight appeared, instead of having\nlost him, we found him in chase of us about a league astern; only, to\nour great good fortune, we could see but one of the two. However, this\none was a great ship, carried six-and-forty guns, and an admirable\nsailer, as appeared by her outsailing us; for our ship was an excellent\nsailer too, as I have said before.\n\nWhen I found this, I easily saw there was no remedy, but we must engage;\nand as we knew we could expect no quarter from those scoundrels the\nPortuguese, a nation I had an original aversion to, I let Captain Wilmot\nknow how it was. The captain, sick as he was, jumped up in the cabin,\nand would be led out upon the deck (for he was very weak) to see how it\nwas. \"Well,\" says he, \"we'll fight them!\"\n\nOur men were all in good heart before, but to see the captain so brisk,\nwho had lain ill of a calenture ten or eleven days, gave them double\ncourage, and they went all hands to work to make a clear ship and\nbe ready. William, the Quaker, comes to me with a kind of a smile.\n\"Friend,\" says he, \"what does yon ship follow us for?\" \"Why,\" says I,\n\"to fight us, you may be sure.\" \"Well,\" says he, \"and will he come up\nwith us, dost thou think?\" \"Yes,\" said I, \"you see she will.\" \"Why,\nthen, friend,\" says the dry wretch, \"why dost thou run from her still,\nwhen thou seest she will overtake thee? Will it be better for us to be\novertaken farther off than here?\" \"Much as one for that,\" says I; \"why,\nwhat would you have us do?\" \"Do!\" says he; \"let us not give the poor man\nmore trouble than needs must; let us stay for him and hear what he has\nto say to us.\" \"He will talk to us in powder and ball,\" said I. \"Very\nwell, then,\" says he, \"if that be his country language, we must talk to\nhim in the same, must we not? or else how shall he understand us?\" \"Very\nwell, William,\" says I, \"we understand you.\" And the captain, as ill as\nhe was, called to me, \"William's right again,\" says he; \"as good here\nas a league farther.\" So he gives a word of command, \"Haul up the\nmain-sail; we'll shorten sail for him.\"\n\nAccordingly we shortened sail, and as we expected her upon our lee-side,\nwe being then upon our starboard tack, brought eighteen of our guns to\nthe larboard side, resolving to give him a broadside that should warm\nhim. It was about half-an-hour before he came up with us, all which\ntime we luffed up, that we might keep the wind of him, by which he was\nobliged to run up under our lee, as we designed him; when we got him\nupon our quarter, we edged down, and received the fire of five or six\nof his guns. By this time you may be sure all our hands were at their\nquarters, so we clapped our helm hard a-weather, let go the lee-braces\nof the maintop sail, and laid it a-back, and so our ship fell athwart\nthe Portuguese ship's hawse; then we immediately poured in our\nbroadside, raking them fore and aft, and killed them a great many men.\n\nThe Portuguese, we could see, were in the utmost confusion; and not\nbeing aware of our design, their ship having fresh way, ran their\nbowsprit into the fore part of our main shrouds, as that they could\nnot easily get clear of us, and so we lay locked after that manner. The\nenemy could not bring above five or six guns, besides their small-arms,\nto bear upon us, while we played our whole broadside upon him.\n\nIn the middle of the heat of this fight, as I was very busy upon the\nquarter-deck, the captain calls to me, for he never stirred from us,\n\"What the devil is friend William a-doing yonder?\" says the captain;\n\"has he any business upon, deck?\" I stepped forward, and there was\nfriend William, with two or three stout fellows, lashing the ship's\nbowsprit fast to our mainmast, for fear they should get away from us;\nand every now and then he pulled a bottle out of his pocket, and gave\nthe men a dram to encourage them. The shot flew about his ears as thick\nas may be supposed in such an action, where the Portuguese, to give them\ntheir due, fought very briskly, believing at first they were sure of\ntheir game, and trusting to their superiority; but there was William, as\ncomposed, and in as perfect tranquillity as to danger, as if he had been\nover a bowl of punch, only very busy securing the matter, that a ship of\nforty-six guns should not run away from a ship of eight-and-twenty.\n\nThis work was too hot to hold long; our men behaved bravely: our gunner,\na gallant man, shouted below, pouring in his shot at such a rate, that\nthe Portuguese began to slacken their fire; we had dismounted several of\ntheir guns by firing in at their forecastle, and raking them, as I said,\nfore and aft. Presently comes William up to me. \"Friend,\" says he, very\ncalmly, \"what dost thou mean? Why dost thou not visit thy neighbour in\nthe ship, the door being open for thee?\" I understood him immediately,\nfor our guns had so torn their hull, that we had beat two port-holes\ninto one, and the bulk-head of their steerage was split to pieces, so\nthat they could not retire to their close quarters; so I gave the word\nimmediately to board them. Our second lieutenant, with about thirty men,\nentered in an instant over the forecastle, followed by some more with\nthe boatswain, and cutting in pieces about twenty-five men that they\nfound upon the deck, and then throwing some grenadoes into the steerage,\nthey entered there also; upon which the Portuguese cried quarter\npresently, and we mastered the ship, contrary indeed to our own\nexpectation; for we would have compounded with them if they would have\nsheered off: but laying them athwart the hawse at first, and following\nour fire furiously, without giving them any time to get clear of us and\nwork their ship; by this means, though they had six-and-forty guns, they\nwere not able to fight above five or six, as I said above, for we beat\nthem immediately from their guns in the forecastle, and killed them\nabundance of men between decks, so that when we entered they had hardly\nfound men enough to fight us hand to hand upon their deck.\n\nThe surprise of joy to hear the Portuguese cry quarter, and see their\nancient struck, was so great to our captain, who, as I have said, was\nreduced very weak with a high fever, that it gave him new life. Nature\nconquered the distemper, and the fever abated that very night; so that\nin two or three days he was sensibly better, his strength began to come,\nand he was able to give his orders effectually in everything that was\nmaterial, and in about ten days was entirely well and about the ship.\n\nIn the meantime I took possession of the Portuguese man-of-war; and\nCaptain Wilmot made me, or rather I made myself, captain of her for\nthe present. About thirty of their seamen took service with us, some of\nwhich were French, some Genoese; and we set the rest on shore the next\nday on a little island on the coast of Brazil, except some wounded men,\nwho were not in a condition to be removed, and whom we were bound to\nkeep on board; but we had an occasion afterwards to dispose of them at\nthe Cape, where, at their own request, we set them on shore.\n\nCaptain Wilmot, as soon as the ship was taken, and the prisoners stowed,\nwas for standing in for the river Janeiro again, not doubting but we\nshould meet with the other man-of-war, who, not having been able to\nfind us, and having lost the company of her comrade, would certainly be\nreturned, and might be surprised by the ship we had taken, if we carried\nPortuguese colours; and our men were all for it.\n\nBut our friend William gave us better counsel, for he came to me,\n\"Friend,\" says he, \"I understand the captain is for sailing back to the\nRio Janeiro, in hopes to meet with the other ship that was in chase of\nthee yesterday. Is it true, dost thou intend it?\" \"Why, yes,\" says I,\n\"William, pray why not?\" \"Nay,\" says he, \"thou mayest do so if thou\nwilt.\" \"Well, I know that too, William,\" said I, \"but the captain is a\nman will be ruled by reason; what have you to say to it?\" \"Why,\" says\nWilliam gravely, \"I only ask what is thy business, and the business\nof all the people thou hast with thee? Is it not to get money?\" \"Yes,\nWilliam, it is so, in our honest way.\" \"And wouldest thou,\" says he,\n\"rather have money without fighting, or fighting without money? I mean\nwhich wouldest thou have by choice, suppose it to be left to thee?\" \"O\nWilliam,\" says I, \"the first of the two, to be sure.\" \"Why, then,\" says\nhe, \"what great gain hast thou made of the prize thou hast taken now,\nthough it has cost the lives of thirteen of thy men, besides some hurt?\nIt is true thou hast got the ship and some prisoners; but thou wouldest\nhave had twice the booty in a merchant-ship, with not one quarter of the\nfighting; and how dost thou know either what force or what number of\nmen may be in the other ship, and what loss thou mayest suffer, and what\ngain it shall be to thee if thou take her? I think, indeed, thou mayest\nmuch better let her alone.\"\n\n\"Why, William, it is true,\" said I, \"and I'll go tell the captain what\nyour opinion is, and bring you word what he says.\" Accordingly in I went\nto the captain and told him William's reasons; and the captain was of\nhis mind, that our business was indeed fighting when we could not help\nit, but that our main affair was money, and that with as few blows as we\ncould. So that adventure was laid aside, and we stood along shore again\nsouth for the river De la Plata, expecting some purchase thereabouts;\nespecially we had our eyes upon some of the Spanish ships from Buenos\nAyres, which are generally very rich in silver, and one such prize would\nhave done our business. We plied about here, in the latitude of ----\nsouth, for near a month, and nothing offered; and here we began to\nconsult what we should do next, for we had come to no resolution yet.\nIndeed, my design was always for the Cape de Bona Speranza, and so to\nthe East Indies. I had heard some flaming stories of Captain Avery,\nand the fine things he had done in the Indies, which were doubled and\ndoubled, even ten thousand fold; and from taking a great prize in\nthe Bay of Bengal, where he took a lady, said to be the Great Mogul's\ndaughter, with a great quantity of jewels about her, we had a story told\nus, that he took a Mogul ship, so the foolish sailors called it, laden\nwith diamonds.\n\nI would fain have had friend William's advice whither we should go, but\nhe always put it off with some quaking quibble or other. In short,\nhe did not care for directing us neither; whether he made a piece of\nconscience of it, or whether he did not care to venture having it come\nagainst him afterwards or no, this I know not; but we concluded at last\nwithout him.\n\nWe were, however, pretty long in resolving, and hankered about the Rio\nde la Plata a long time. At last we spied a sail to windward, and it was\nsuch a sail as I believe had not been seen in that part of the world a\ngreat while. It wanted not that we should give it chase, for it stood\ndirectly towards us, as well as they that steered could make it; and\neven that was more accident of weather than anything else, for if the\nwind had chopped about anywhere they must have gone with it. I leave any\nman that is a sailor, or understands anything of a ship, to judge what\na figure this ship made when we first saw her, and what we could imagine\nwas the matter with her. Her maintop-mast was come by the board\nabout six foot above the cap, and fell forward, the head of the\ntopgallant-mast hanging in the fore-shrouds by the stay; at the same\ntime the parrel of the mizzen-topsail-yard by some accident giving way,\nthe mizzen-topsail-braces (the standing part of which being fast to the\nmain-topsail shrouds) brought the mizzen-topsail, yard and all, down\nwith it, which spread over part of the quarter-deck like an awning; the\nfore-topsail was hoisted up two-thirds of the mast, but the sheets were\nflown; the fore-yard was lowered down upon the forecastle, the sail\nloose, and part of it hanging overboard. In this manner she came down\nupon us with the wind quartering. In a word, the figure the whole ship\nmade was the most confounding to men that understood the sea that ever\nwas seen. She had no boat, neither had she any colours out.\n\nWhen we came near to her, we fired a gun to bring her to. She took no\nnotice of it, nor of us, but came on just as she did before. We fired\nagain, but it was all one. At length we came within pistol-shot of one\nanother, but nobody answered nor appeared; so we began to think that\nit was a ship gone ashore somewhere in distress, and the men having\nforsaken her, the high tide had floated her off to sea. Coming nearer\nto her, we ran up alongside of her so close that we could hear a noise\nwithin her, and see the motion of several people through her ports.\n\nUpon this we manned out two boats full of men, and very well armed, and\nordered them to board her at the same minute, as near as they could, and\nto enter one at her fore-chains on the one side, and the other amidships\non the other side. As soon as they came to the ship's side, a surprising\nmultitude of black sailors, such as they were, appeared upon deck, and,\nin short, terrified our men so much that the boat which was to enter her\nmen in the waist stood off again, and durst not board her; and the men\nthat entered out of the other boat, finding the first boat, as they\nthought, beaten off, and seeing the ship full of men, jumped all back\nagain into their boat, and put off, not knowing what the matter was.\nUpon this we prepared to pour in a broadside upon her; but our friend\nWilliam set us to rights again here; for it seems he guessed how it was\nsooner than we did, and coming up to me (for it was our ship that came\nup with her), \"Friend,\" says he, \"I am of opinion that thou art wrong\nin this matter, and thy men have been wrong also in their conduct. I'll\ntell thee how thou shalt take this ship, without making use of those\nthings called guns.\" \"How can that be, William?\" said I. \"Why,\" said he,\n\"thou mayest take her with thy helm; thou seest they keep no steerage,\nand thou seest the condition they are in; board her with thy ship upon\nher lee quarter, and so enter her from the ship. I am persuaded thou\nwilt take her without fighting, for there is some mischief has befallen\nthe ship, which we know nothing of.\"\n\nIn a word, it being a smooth sea, and little wind, I took his advice,\nand laid her aboard. Immediately our men entered the ship, where we\nfound a large ship, with upwards of 600 negroes, men and women, boys and\ngirls, and not one Christian or white man on board.\n\nI was struck with horror at the sight; for immediately I concluded, as\nwas partly the case, that these black devils had got loose, had murdered\nall the white men, and thrown them into the sea; and I had no sooner\ntold my mind to the men, but the thought so enraged them that I had much\nado to keep my men from cutting them all in pieces. But William, with\nmany persuasions, prevailed upon them, by telling them that it was\nnothing but what, if they were in the negroes' condition, they would\ndo if they could; and that the negroes had really the highest injustice\ndone them, to be sold for slaves without their consent; and that the\nlaw of nature dictated it to them; that they ought not to kill them, and\nthat it would be wilful murder to do it.\n\nThis prevailed with them, and cooled their first heat; so they only\nknocked down twenty or thirty of them, and the rest ran all down between\ndecks to their first places, believing, as we fancied, that we were\ntheir first masters come again.\n\nIt was a most unaccountable difficulty we had next; for we could not\nmake them understand one word we said, nor could we understand one word\nourselves that they said. We endeavoured by signs to ask them whence\nthey came; but they could make nothing of it. We pointed to the great\ncabin, to the round-house, to the cook-room, then to our faces, to ask\nif they had no white men on board, and where they were gone; but they\ncould not understand what we meant. On the other hand, they pointed to\nour boat and to their ship, asking questions as well as they could, and\nsaid a thousand things, and expressed themselves with great earnestness;\nbut we could not understand a word of it all, or know what they meant by\nany of their signs.\n\nWe knew very well they must have been taken on board the ship as slaves,\nand that it must be by some European people too. We could easily see\nthat the ship was a Dutch-built ship, but very much altered, having been\nbuilt upon, and, as we supposed, in France; for we found two or three\nFrench books on board, and afterwards we found clothes, linen, lace,\nsome old shoes, and several other things. We found among the provisions\nsome barrels of Irish beef, some Newfoundland fish, and several other\nevidences that there had been Christians on board, but saw no remains of\nthem. We found not a sword, gun, pistol, or weapon of any kind, except\nsome cutlasses; and the negroes had hid them below where they lay. We\nasked them what was become of all the small-arms, pointing to our own\nand to the places where those belonging to the ship had hung. One of\nthe negroes understood me presently, and beckoned to me to come upon the\ndeck, where, taking my fuzee, which I never let go out of my hand for\nsome time after we had mastered the ship--I say, offering to take hold\nof it, he made the proper motion of throwing it into the sea; by which\nI understood, as I did afterwards, that they had thrown all the\nsmall-arms, powder, shot, swords, &c., into the sea, believing, as I\nsupposed, those things would kill them, though the men were gone.\n\nAfter we understood this we made no question but that the ship's crew,\nhaving been surprised by these desperate rogues, had gone the same way,\nand had been thrown overboard also. We looked all over the ship to\nsee if we could find any blood, and we thought we did perceive some in\nseveral places; but the heat of the sun, melting the pitch and tar upon\nthe decks, made it impossible for us to discern it exactly, except in\nthe round-house, where we plainly saw that there had been much blood. We\nfound the scuttle open, by which we supposed that the captain and those\nthat were with him had made their retreat into the great cabin, or those\nin the cabin had made their escape up into the round-house.\n\nBut that which confirmed us most of all in what had happened was that,\nupon further inquiry, we found that there were seven or eight of the\nnegroes very much wounded, two or three of them with shot, whereof one\nhad his leg broken and lay in a miserable condition, the flesh being\nmortified, and, as our friend William said, in two days more he would\nhave died. William was a most dexterous surgeon, and he showed it in\nthis cure; for though all the surgeons we had on board both our ships\n(and we had no less than five that called themselves bred surgeons,\nbesides two or three who were pretenders or assistants)--though all\nthese gave their opinions that the negro's leg must be cut off, and\nthat his life could not be saved without it; that the mortification had\ntouched the marrow in the bone, that the tendons were mortified, and\nthat he could never have the use of his leg if it should be cured,\nWilliam said nothing in general, but that his opinion was otherwise, and\nthat he desired the wound might be searched, and that he would then\ntell them further. Accordingly he went to work with the leg; and, as\nhe desired that he might have some of the surgeons to assist him, we\nappointed him two of the ablest of them to help, and all of them to look\non, if they thought fit.\n\nWilliam went to work his own way, and some of them pretended to find\nfault at first. However, he proceeded and searched every part of the leg\nwhere he suspected the mortification had touched it; in a word, he cut\noff a great deal of mortified flesh, in all which the poor fellow felt\nno pain. William proceeded till he brought the vessels which he had cut\nto bleed, and the man to cry out; then he reduced the splinters of the\nbone, and, calling for help, set it, as we call it, and bound it up, and\nlaid the man to rest, who found himself much easier than before.\n\nAt the first opening the surgeons began to triumph; the mortification\nseemed to spread, and a long red streak of blood appeared from the wound\nupwards to the middle of the man's thigh, and the surgeons told me the\nman would die in a few hours. I went to look at it, and found William\nhimself under some surprise; but when I asked him how long he thought\nthe poor fellow could live, he looked gravely at me, and said, \"As long\nas thou canst; I am not at all apprehensive of his life,\" said he, \"but\nI would cure him, if I could, without making a cripple of him.\" I found\nhe was not just then upon the operation as to his leg, but was mixing\nup something to give the poor creature, to repel, as I thought, the\nspreading contagion, and to abate or prevent any feverish temper that\nmight happen in the blood; after which he went to work again, and opened\nthe leg in two places above the wound, cutting out a great deal of\nmortified flesh, which it seemed was occasioned by the bandage, which\nhad pressed the parts too much; and withal, the blood being at the time\nin a more than common disposition to mortify, might assist to spread it.\n\nWell, our friend William conquered all this, cleared the spreading\nmortification, and the red streak went off again, the flesh began to\nheal, and matter to run; and in a few days the man's spirits began to\nrecover, his pulse beat regular, he had no fever, and gathered strength\ndaily; and, in a word, he was a perfect sound man in about ten weeks,\nand we kept him amongst us, and made him an able seaman. But to return\nto the ship: we never could come at a certain information about it, till\nsome of the negroes which we kept on board, and whom we taught to speak\nEnglish, gave the account of it afterwards, and this maimed man in\nparticular.\n\nWe inquired, by all the signs and motions we could imagine, what was\nbecome of the people, and yet we could get nothing from them. Our\nlieutenant was for torturing some of them to make them confess,\nbut William opposed that vehemently; and when he heard it was under\nconsideration he came to me. \"Friend,\" says he, \"I make a request to\nthee not to put any of these poor wretches to torment.\" \"Why, William,\"\nsaid I, \"why not? You see they will not give any account of what is\nbecome of the white men.\" \"Nay,\" says William, \"do not say so; I suppose\nthey have given thee a full account of every particular of it.\" \"How\nso?\" says I; \"pray what are we the wiser for all their jabbering?\"\n\"Nay,\" says William, \"that may be thy fault, for aught I know; thou wilt\nnot punish the poor men because they cannot speak English; and perhaps\nthey never heard a word of English before. Now, I may very well suppose\nthat they have given thee a large account of everything; for thou seest\nwith what earnestness, and how long, some of them have talked to thee;\nand if thou canst not understand their language, nor they thine, how can\nthey help that? At the best, thou dost but suppose that they have not\ntold thee the whole truth of the story; and, on the contrary, I suppose\nthey have; and how wilt thou decide the question, whether thou art right\nor whether I am right? Besides, what can they say to thee when thou\naskest them a question upon the torture, and at the same time they do\nnot understand the question, and thou dost not know whether they say ay\nor no?\"\n\nIt is no compliment to my moderation to say I was convinced by these\nreasons; and yet we had all much ado to keep our second lieutenant from\nmurdering some of them, to make them tell. What if they had told? He did\nnot understand one word of it; but he would not be persuaded but that\nthe negroes must needs understand him when he asked them whether the\nship had any boat or no, like ours, and what was become of it.\n\nBut there was no remedy but to wait till we made these people understand\nEnglish, and to adjourn the story till that time. The case was thus:\nwhere they were taken on board the ship, that we could never understand,\nbecause they never knew the English names which we give to those coasts,\nor what nation they were who belonged to the ship, because they knew not\none tongue from another; but thus far the negro I examined, who was the\nsame whose leg William had cured, told us, that they did not speak the\nsame language as we spoke, nor the same our Portuguese spoke; so that in\nall probability they must be French or Dutch.\n\nThen he told us that the white men used them barbarously; that they beat\nthem unmercifully; that one of the negro men had a wife and two negro\nchildren, one a daughter, about sixteen years old; that a white man\nabused the negro man's wife, and afterwards his daughter, which, as he\nsaid, made all the negro men mad; and that the woman's husband was in a\ngreat rage; at which the white man was so provoked that he threatened\nto kill him; but, in the night, the negro man, being loose, got a great\nclub, by which he made us understand he meant a handspike, and that when\nthe same Frenchman (if it was a Frenchman) came among them again, he\nbegan again to abuse the negro man's wife, at which the negro, taking up\nthe handspike, knocked his brains out at one blow; and then taking the\nkey from him with which he usually unlocked the handcuffs which the\nnegroes were fettered with, he set about a hundred of them at liberty,\nwho, getting up upon the deck by the same scuttle that the white men\ncame down, and taking the man's cutlass who was killed, and laying hold\nof what came next them, they fell upon the men that were upon the\ndeck, and killed them all, and afterwards those they found upon the\nforecastle; that the captain and his other men, who were in the cabin\nand the round-house, defended themselves with great courage, and shot\nout at the loopholes at them, by which he and several other men were\nwounded, and some killed; but that they broke into the round-house after\na long dispute, where they killed two of the white men, but owned that\nthe two white men killed eleven of their men before they could break\nin; and then the rest, having got down the scuttle into the great cabin,\nwounded three more of them.\n\nThat, after this, the gunner of the ship having secured himself in the\ngun-room, one of his men hauled up the long-boat close under the stern,\nand putting into her all the arms and ammunition they could come at, got\nall into the boat, and afterwards took in the captain, and those that\nwere with him, out of the great cabin. When they were all thus embarked,\nthey resolved to lay the ship aboard again, and try to recover it. That\nthey boarded the ship in a desperate manner, and killed at first all\nthat stood in their way; but the negroes being by this time all loose,\nand having gotten some arms, though they understood nothing of powder\nand bullet, or guns, yet the men could never master them. However, they\nlay under the ship's bow, and got out all the men they had left in the\ncook-room, who had maintained themselves there, notwithstanding all the\nnegroes could do, and with their small-arms killed between thirty and\nforty of the negroes, but were at last forced to leave them.\n\nThey could give me no account whereabouts this was, whether near the\ncoast of Africa, or far off, or how long it was before the ship fell\ninto our hands; only, in general, it was a great while ago, as they\ncalled it; and, by all we could learn, it was within two or three days\nafter they had set sail from the coast. They told us that they had\nkilled about thirty of the white men, having knocked them on the head\nwith crows and handspikes, and such things as they could get; and one\nstrong negro killed three of them with an iron crow, after he was shot\ntwice through the body; and that he was afterwards shot through the\nhead by the captain himself at the door of the round-house, which he had\nsplit open with the crow; and this we supposed was the occasion of the\ngreat quantity of blood which we saw at the round-house door.\n\nThe same negro told us that they threw all the powder and shot they\ncould find into the sea, and they would have thrown the great guns into\nthe sea if they could have lifted them. Being asked how they came\nto have their sails in such a condition, his answer was, \"They no\nunderstand; they no know what the sails do;\" that was, they did not so\nmuch as know that it was the sails that made the ship go, or understand\nwhat they meant, or what to do with them. When we asked him whither they\nwere going, he said they did not know, but believed they should go home\nto their own country again. I asked him, in particular, what he thought\nwe were when we first came up with them? He said they were terribly\nfrighted, believing we were the same white men that had gone away in\ntheir boats, and were come again in a great ship, with the two boats\nwith them, and expected they would kill them all.\n\nThis was the account we got out of them, after we had taught them\nto speak English, and to understand the names and use of the things\nbelonging to the ship which they had occasion to speak of; and we\nobserved that the fellows were too innocent to dissemble in their\nrelation, and that they all agreed in the particulars, and were always\nin the same story, which confirmed very much the truth of what they\nsaid.\n\nHaving taken this ship, our next difficulty was, what to do with the\nnegroes. The Portuguese in the Brazils would have bought them all of us,\nand been glad of the purchase, if we had not showed ourselves enemies\nthere, and been known for pirates; but, as it was, we durst not go\nashore anywhere thereabouts, or treat with any of the planters, because\nwe should raise the whole country upon us; and, if there were any such\nthings as men-of-war in any of their ports, we should be as sure to be\nattacked by them, and by all the force they had by land or sea.\n\nNor could we think of any better success if we went northward to our own\nplantations. One while we determined to carry them all away to Buenos\nAyres, and sell them there to the Spaniards; but they were really too\nmany for them to make use of; and to carry them round to the South Seas,\nwhich was the only remedy that was left, was so far that we should be no\nway able to subsist them for so long a voyage.\n\nAt last, our old, never-failing friend, William, helped us out again, as\nhe had often done at a dead lift. His proposal was this, that he should\ngo as master of the ship, and about twenty men, such as we could best\ntrust, and attempt to trade privately, upon the coast of Brazil, with\nthe planters, not at the principal ports, because that would not be\nadmitted.\n\nWe all agreed to this, and appointed to go away ourselves towards the\nRio de la Plata, where we had thought of going before, and to wait for\nhim, not there, but at Port St Pedro, as the Spaniards call it, lying\nat the mouth of the river which they call Rio Grande, and where the\nSpaniards had a small fort and a few people, but we believe there was\nnobody in it.\n\nHere we took up our station, cruising off and on, to see if we could\nmeet any ships going to or coming from the Buenos Ayres or the Rio de\nla Plata; but we met with nothing worth notice. However, we employed\nourselves in things necessary for our going off to sea; for we filled\nall our water-casks, and got some fish for our present use, to spare as\nmuch as possible our ship's stores.\n\nWilliam, in the meantime, went away to the north, and made the land\nabout the Cape de St Thomas; and betwixt that and the isles De Tuberon\nhe found means to trade with the planters for all his negroes, as well\nthe women as the men, and at a very good price too; for William, who\nspoke Portuguese pretty well, told them a fair story enough, that the\nship was in scarcity of provisions, that they were driven a great way\nout of their way, and indeed, as we say, out of their knowledge, and\nthat they must go up to the northward as far as Jamaica, or sell there\nupon the coast. This was a very plausible tale, and was easily believed;\nand, if you observe the manner of the negroes' sailing, and what\nhappened in their voyage, was every word of it true.\n\nBy this method, and being true to one another, William passed for what\nhe was--I mean, for a very honest fellow; and by the assistance of one\nplanter, who sent to some of his neighbour planters, and managed the\ntrade among themselves, he got a quick market; for in less than five\nweeks William sold all his negroes, and at last sold the ship itself,\nand shipped himself and his twenty men, with two negro boys whom he had\nleft, in a sloop, one of those which the planters used to send on board\nfor the negroes. With this sloop Captain William, as we then called him,\ncame away, and found us at Port St Pedro, in the latitude of 32 degrees\n30 minutes south.\n\nNothing was more surprising to us than to see a sloop come along the\ncoast, carrying Portuguese colours, and come in directly to us, after we\nwere assured he had discovered both our ships. We fired a gun, upon her\nnearer approach, to bring her to an anchor, but immediately she fired\nfive guns by way of salute, and spread her English ancient. Then we\nbegan to guess it was friend William, but wondered what was the meaning\nof his being in a sloop, whereas we sent him away in a ship of near 300\ntons; but he soon let us into the whole history of his management, with\nwhich we had a great deal of reason to be very well satisfied. As soon\nas he had brought the sloop to an anchor, he came aboard of my ship,\nand there he gave us an account how he began to trade by the help of a\nPortuguese planter, who lived near the seaside; how he went on shore and\nwent up to the first house he could see, and asked the man of the house\nto sell him some hogs, pretending at first he only stood in upon the\ncoast to take in fresh water and buy some provisions; and the man not\nonly sold him seven fat hogs, but invited him in, and gave him, and five\nmen he had with him, a very good dinner; and he invited the planter on\nboard his ship, and, in return for his kindness, gave him a negro girl\nfor his wife.\n\nThis so obliged the planter that the next morning he sent him on board,\nin a great luggage-boat, a cow and two sheep, with a chest of sweetmeats\nand some sugar, and a great bag of tobacco, and invited Captain William\non shore again; that, after this, they grew from one kindness to\nanother; that they began to talk about trading for some negroes; and\nWilliam, pretending it was to do him service, consented to sell him\nthirty negroes for his private use in his plantation, for which he gave\nWilliam ready money in gold, at the rate of five-and-thirty moidores per\nhead; but the planter was obliged to use great caution in the bringing\nthem on shore; for which purpose he made William weigh and stand out\nto sea, and put in again, about fifty miles farther north, where at a\nlittle creek he took the negroes on shore at another plantation, being a\nfriend's of his, whom, it seems, he could trust.\n\nThis remove brought William into a further intimacy, not only with the\nfirst planter, but also with his friends, who desired to have some of\nthe negroes also; so that, from one to another, they bought so many,\ntill one overgrown planter took 100 negroes, which was all William\nhad left, and sharing them with another planter, that other planter\nchaffered with William for ship and all, giving him in exchange a very\nclean, large, well-built sloop of near sixty tons, very well furnished,\ncarrying six guns; but we made her afterwards carry twelve guns. William\nhad 300 moidores of gold, besides the sloop, in payment for the ship;\nand with this money he stored the sloop as full as she could hold with\nprovisions, especially bread, some pork, and about sixty hogs alive;\namong the rest, William got eighty barrels of good gunpowder, which\nwas very much for our purpose; and all the provisions which were in the\nFrench ship he took out also.\n\nThis was a very agreeable account to us, especially when we saw that\nWilliam had received in gold coined, or by weight, and some Spanish\nsilver, 60,000 pieces of eight, besides a new sloop, and a vast quantity\nof provisions.\n\nWe were very glad of the sloop in particular, and began to consult what\nwe should do, whether we had not best turn off our great Portuguese\nship, and stick to our first ship and the sloop, seeing we had scarce\nmen enough for all three, and that the biggest ship was thought too\nbig for our business. However, another dispute, which was now decided,\nbrought the first to a conclusion. The first dispute was, whither we\nshould go. My comrade, as I called him now, that is to say, he that was\nmy captain before we took this Portuguese man-of-war, was for going to\nthe South Seas, and coasting up the west side of America, where we could\nnot fail of making several good prizes upon the Spaniards; and that\nthen, if occasion required it, we might come home by the South Seas to\nthe East Indies, and so go round the globe, as others had done before\nus.\n\nBut my head lay another way. I had been in the East Indies, and had\nentertained a notion ever since that, if we went thither, we could not\nfail of making good work of it, and that we might have a safe retreat,\nand good beef to victual our ship, among my old friends the natives of\nZanzibar, on the coast of Mozambique, or the island of St Lawrence. I\nsay, my thoughts lay this way; and I read so many lectures to them all\nof the advantages they would certainly make of their strength by the\nprizes they would take in the Gulf of Mocha, or the Red Sea, and on the\ncoast of Malabar, or the Bay of Bengal, that I amazed them.\n\nWith these arguments I prevailed on them, and we all resolved to\nsteer away S.E. for the Cape of Good Hope; and, in consequence of this\nresolution, we concluded to keep the sloop, and sail with all three, not\ndoubting, as I assured them, but we should find men there to make up\nthe number wanting, and if not, we might cast any of them off when we\npleased.\n\nWe could do no less than make our friend William captain of the sloop\nwhich, with such good management, he had brought us. He told us, though\nwith much good manners, he would not command her as a frigate; but, if\nwe would give her to him for his share of the Guinea ship, which we\ncame very honestly by, he would keep us company as a victualler, if\nwe commanded him, as long as he was under the same force that took him\naway.\n\nWe understood him, so gave him the sloop, but upon condition that\nhe should not go from us, and should be entirely under our command.\nHowever, William was not so easy as before; and, indeed, as we\nafterwards wanted the sloop to cruise for purchase, and a right\nthorough-paced pirate in her, so I was in such pain for William that I\ncould not be without him, for he was my privy counsellor and companion\nupon all occasions; so I put a Scotsman, a bold, enterprising, gallant\nfellow, into her, named Gordon, and made her carry twelve guns and four\npetereroes, though, indeed, we wanted men, for we were none of us manned\nin proportion to our force.\n\nWe sailed away for the Cape of Good Hope the beginning of October 1706,\nand passed by, in sight of the Cape, the 12th of November following,\nhaving met with a great deal of bad weather. We saw several\nmerchant-ships in the roads there, as well English as Dutch, whether\noutward bound or homeward we could not tell; be it what it would, we did\nnot think fit to come to an anchor, not knowing what they might be,\nor what they might attempt against us, when they knew what we were.\nHowever, as we wanted fresh water, we sent the two boats belonging to\nthe Portuguese man-of-war, with all Portuguese seamen or negroes in\nthem, to the watering-place, to take in water; and in the meantime we\nhung out a Portuguese ancient at sea, and lay by all that night. They\nknew not what we were, but it seems we passed for anything but really\nwhat we was.\n\nOur boats returning the third time loaden, about five o'clock next\nmorning, we thought ourselves sufficiently watered, and stood away\nto the eastward; but, before our men returned the last time, the wind\nblowing an easy gale at west, we perceived a boat in the grey of the\nmorning under sail, crowding to come up with us, as if they were afraid\nwe should be gone. We soon found it was an English long-boat, and that\nit was pretty full of men. We could not imagine what the meaning of it\nshould be; but, as it was but a boat, we thought there could be no great\nharm in it to let them come on board; and if it appeared they came\nonly to inquire who we were, we would give them a full account of our\nbusiness, by taking them along with us, seeing we wanted men as much as\nanything. But they saved us the labour of being in doubt how to dispose\nof them; for it seems our Portuguese seamen, who went for water, had\nnot been so silent at the watering-places as we thought they would have\nbeen. But the case, in short, was this: Captain ---- (I forbear his\nname at present, for a particular reason), captain of an East India\nmerchant-ship, bound afterwards for China, had found some reason to be\nvery severe with his men, and had handled some of them very roughly at\nSt Helena; insomuch, that they threatened among themselves to leave the\nship the first opportunity, and had long wished for that opportunity.\nSome of these men, it seems, had met with our boat at the\nwatering-place, and inquiring of one another who we were, and upon what\naccount, whether the Portuguese seamen, by faltering in their account,\nmade them suspect that we were out upon the cruise, or whether they\ntold it in plain English or no (for they all spoke English enough to\nbe understood), but so it was, that as soon as ever the men carried the\nnews on board, that the ships which lay by to the eastward were English,\nand that they were going upon the _account_, which, by they way, was a\nsea term for a pirate; I say, as soon as ever they heard it, they went\nto work, and getting all things ready in the night, their chests and\nclothes, and whatever else they could, they came away before it was day,\nand came up with us about seven o'clock.\n\nWhen they came by the ship's side which I commanded we hailed them\nin the usual manner, to know what and who they were, and what their\nbusiness. They answered they were Englishmen, and desired to come on\nboard. We told them they might lay the ship on board, but ordered they\nshould let only one man enter the ship till the captain knew their\nbusiness, and that he should come without any arms. They said, Ay, with\nall their hearts.\n\nWe presently found their business, and that they desired to go with us;\nand as for their arms, they desired we would send men on board the boat,\nand that they would deliver them all to us, which was done. The fellow\nthat came up to me told me how they had been used by their captain, how\nhe had starved the men, and used them like dogs, and that, if the rest\nof the men knew they should be admitted, he was satisfied two-thirds\nof them would leave the ship. We found the fellows were very hearty in\ntheir resolution, and jolly brisk sailors they were; so I told them I\nwould do nothing without our admiral, that was the captain of the other\nship; so I sent my pinnace on board Captain Wilmot, to desire him to\ncome on board. But he was indisposed, and being to leeward, excused his\ncoming, but left it all to me; but before my boat was returned, Captain\nWilmot called to me by his speaking-trumpet, which all the men might\nhear as well as I; thus, calling me by my name, \"I hear they are honest\nfellows; pray tell them they are all welcome, and make them a bowl of\npunch.\"\n\nAs the men heard it as well as I, there was no need to tell them what\nthe captain said; and, as soon as the trumpet had done, they set up a\nhuzza, that showed us they were very hearty in their coming to us; but\nwe bound them to us by a stronger obligation still after this, for when\nwe came to Madagascar, Captain Wilmot, with consent of all the ship's\ncompany, ordered that these men should have as much money given them out\nof the stock as was due to them for their pay in the ship they had\nleft; and after that we allowed them twenty pieces of eight a man bounty\nmoney; and thus we entered them upon shares, as we were all, and brave\nstout fellows they were, being eighteen in number, whereof two were\nmidshipmen, and one a carpenter.\n\nIt was the 28th of November, when, having had some bad weather, we came\nto an anchor in the road off St Augustine Bay, at the south-west end\nof my old acquaintance the isle of Madagascar. We lay here awhile and\ntrafficked with the natives for some good beef; though the weather was\nso hot that we could not promise ourselves to salt any of it up to keep;\nbut I showed them the way which we practised before, to salt it first\nwith saltpetre, then cure it by drying it in the sun, which made it eat\nvery agreeably, though not so wholesome for our men, that not agreeing\nwith our way of cooking, viz., boiling with pudding, brewis, &c., and\nparticularly this way, would be too salt, and the fat of the meat be\nrusty, or dried away so as not to be eaten.\n\nThis, however, we could not help, and made ourselves amends by feeding\nheartily on the fresh beef while we were there, which was excellent,\ngood and fat, every way as tender and as well relished as in England,\nand thought to be much better to us who had not tasted any in England\nfor so long a time.\n\nHaving now for some time remained here, we began to consider that\nthis was not a place for our business; and I, that had some views a\nparticular way of my own, told them that this was not a station for\nthose who looked for purchase; that there were two parts of the island\nwhich were particularly proper for our purposes; first, the bay on the\neast side of the island, and from thence to the island Mauritius, which\nwas the usual way which ships that came from the Malabar coast, or the\ncoast of Coromandel, Fort St George, &c., used to take, and where, if we\nwaited for them, we ought to take our station.\n\nBut, on the other hand, as we did not resolve to fall upon the European\ntraders, who were generally ships of force and well manned, and where\nblows must be looked for; so I had another prospect, which I promised\nmyself would yield equal profit, or perhaps greater, without any of the\nhazard and difficulty of the former; and this was the Gulf of Mocha, or\nthe Red Sea.\n\nI told them that the trade here was great, the ships rich, and the\nStrait of Babelmandel narrow; so that there was no doubt but we might\ncruise so as to let nothing slip our hands, having the seas open from\nthe Red Sea, along the coast of Arabia, to the Persian Gulf, and the\nMalabar side of the Indies.\n\nI told them what I had observed when I sailed round the island in my\nformer progress; how that, on the northernmost point of the island,\nthere were several very good harbours and roads for our ships; that\nthe natives were even more civil and tractable, if possible, than those\nwhere we were, not having been so often ill-treated by European sailors\nas those had in the south and east sides; and that we might always be\nsure of a retreat, if we were driven to put in by any necessity, either\nof enemies or weather.\n\nThey were easily convinced of the reasonableness of my scheme; and\nCaptain Wilmot, whom I now called our admiral, though he was at first of\nthe mind to go and lie at the island Mauritius, and wait for some of\nthe European merchant-ships from the road of Coromandel, or the Bay of\nBengal, was now of my mind. It is true we were strong enough to have\nattacked an English East India ship of the greatest force, though some\nof them were said to carry fifty guns; but I represented to him that\nwe were sure to have blows and blood if we took them; and, after we had\ndone, their loading was not of equal value to us, because we had no room\nto dispose of their merchandise; and, as our circumstances stood, we had\nrather have taken one outward-bound East India ship, with her ready cash\non board, perhaps to the value of forty or fifty thousand pounds, than\nthree homeward-bound, though their loading would at London be worth\nthree times the money, because we knew not whither to go to dispose of\nthe cargo; whereas the ships from London had abundance of things we\nknew how to make use of besides their money, such as their stores of\nprovisions and liquors, and great quantities of the like sent to the\ngovernors and factories at the English settlements for their use; so\nthat, if we resolved to look for our own country ships, it should be\nthose that were outward-bound, not the London ships homeward.\n\nAll these things considered, brought the admiral to be of my mind\nentirely; so, after taking in water and some fresh provisions where\nwe lay, which was near Cape St Mary, on the south-west corner of the\nisland, we weighed and stood away south, and afterwards S.S.E., to\nround the island, and in about six days' sail got out of the wake of the\nisland, and steered away north, till we came off Port Dauphin, and then\nnorth by east, to the latitude of 13 degrees 40 minutes, which was, in\nshort, just at the farthest part of the island; and the admiral, keeping\nahead, made the open sea fair to the west, clear of the whole island;\nupon which he brought to, and we sent a sloop to stand in round the\nfarthest point north, and coast along the shore, and see for a harbour\nto put into, which they did, and soon brought us an account that there\nwas a deep bay, with a very good road, and several little islands, under\nwhich they found good riding, in ten to seventeen fathom water, and\naccordingly there we put in.\n\nHowever, we afterwards found occasion to remove our station, as you\nshall hear presently. We had now nothing to do but go on shore, and\nacquaint ourselves a little with the natives, take in fresh water and\nsome fresh provisions, and then to sea again. We found the people\nvery easy to deal with, and some cattle they had; but it being at the\nextremity of the island, they had not such quantities of cattle here.\nHowever, for the present we resolved to appoint this for our place of\nrendezvous, and go and look out. This was about the latter end of April.\n\nAccordingly we put to sea, and cruised away to the northward, for the\nArabian coast. It was a long run, but as the winds generally blow trade\nfrom the S. and S.S.E. from May to September, we had good weather; and\nin about twenty days we made the island of Socotra, lying south from the\nArabian coast, and E.S.E. from the mouth of the Gulf of Mocha, or the\nRed Sea.\n\nHere we took in water, and stood off and on upon the Arabian shore. We\nhad not cruised here above three days, or thereabouts, but I spied a\nsail, and gave her chase; but when we came up with her, never was such a\npoor prize chased by pirates that looked for booty, for we found nothing\nin her but poor, half-naked Turks, going a pilgrimage to Mecca, to the\ntomb of their prophet Mahomet. The junk that carried them had no one\nthing worth taking away but a little rice and some coffee, which was\nall the poor wretches had for their subsistence; so we let them go, for\nindeed we knew not what to do with them.\n\nThe same evening we chased another junk with two masts, and in something\nbetter plight to look at than the former. When we came on board we found\nthem upon the same errand, but only that they were people of some better\nfashion than the other; and here we got some plunder, some Turkish\nstores, a few diamonds in the ear-drops of five or six persons, some\nfine Persian carpets, of which they made their saffras to lie upon, and\nsome money; so we let them go also.\n\nWe continued here eleven days longer, and saw nothing but now and then a\nfishing-boat; but the twelfth day of our cruise we spied a ship: indeed\nI thought at first it had been an English ship, but it appeared to be\nan European freighted for a voyage from Goa, on the coast of Malabar, to\nthe Red Sea, and was very rich. We chased her, and took her without any\nfight, though they had some guns on board too, but not many. We found\nher manned with Portuguese seamen, but under the direction of five\nmerchant Turks, who had hired her on the coast of Malabar of some\nPortugal merchants, and had laden her with pepper, saltpetre, some\nspices, and the rest of the loading was chiefly calicoes and wrought\nsilks, some of them very rich.\n\nWe took her and carried her to Socotra; but we really knew not what to\ndo with her, for the same reasons as before; for all their goods were of\nlittle or no value to us. After some days we found means to let one of\nthe Turkish merchants know, that if he would ransom the ship we would\ntake a sum of money and let them go. He told me that if I would let one\nof them go on shore for the money they would do it; so we adjusted the\nvalue of the cargo at 30,000 ducats. Upon this agreement, we allowed the\nsloop to carry him on shore, at Dofar, in Arabia, where a rich merchant\nlaid down the money for them, and came off with our sloop; and on\npayment of the money we very fairly and honestly let them go.\n\nSome days after this we took an Arabian junk, going from the Gulf of\nPersia to Mocha, with a good quantity of pearl on board. We gutted him\nof the pearl, which it seems was belonging to some merchants at Mocha,\nand let him go, for there was nothing else worth our taking.\n\nWe continued cruising up and down here till we began to find our\nprovisions grow low, when Captain Wilmot, our admiral, told us it was\ntime to think of going back to the rendezvous; and the rest of the men\nsaid the same, being a little weary of beating about for above three\nmonths together, and meeting with little or nothing compared to our\ngreat expectations; but I was very loth to part with the Red Sea at so\ncheap a rate, and pressed them to tarry a little longer, which at my\ninstance they did; but three days afterwards, to our great misfortune,\nunderstood that, by landing the Turkish merchants at Dofar, we had\nalarmed the coast as far as the Gulf of Persia, so that no vessel would\nstir that way, and consequently nothing was to be expected on that side.\n\nI was greatly mortified at this news, and could no longer withstand the\nimportunities of the men to return to Madagascar. However, as the wind\ncontinued still to blow at S.S.E. by S., we were obliged to stand away\ntowards the coast of Africa and the Cape Guardafui, the winds being more\nvariable under the shore than in the open sea.\n\nHere we chopped upon a booty which we did not look for, and which made\namends for all our waiting; for the very same hour that we made land we\nspied a large vessel sailing along the shore to the southward. The ship\nwas of Bengal, belonging to the Great Mogul's country, but had on board\na Dutch pilot, whose name, if I remember right, was Vandergest, and\nseveral European seamen, whereof three were English. She was in no\ncondition to resist us. The rest of her seamen were Indians of the\nMogul's subjects, some Malabars and some others. There were five Indian\nmerchants on board, and some Armenians. It seems they had been at Mocha\nwith spices, silks, diamonds, pearls, calico, &c., such goods as the\ncountry afforded, and had little on board now but money in pieces of\neight, which, by the way, was just what we wanted; and the three English\nseamen came along with us, and the Dutch pilot would have done so too,\nbut the two Armenian merchants entreated us not to take him, for that he\nbeing their pilot, there was none of the men knew how to guide the ship;\nso, at their request, we refused him; but we made them promise he should\nnot be used ill for being willing to go with us.\n\nWe got near 200,000 pieces of eight in this vessel; and, if they said\ntrue, there was a Jew of Goa, who intended to have embarked with them,\nwho had 200,000 pieces of eight with him, all his own; but his good\nfortune, springing out of his ill fortune, hindered him, or he fell sick\nat Mocha, and could not be ready to travel, which was the saving of his\nmoney.\n\nThere was none with me at the taking this prize but the sloop, for\nCaptain Wilmot's ship proving leaky, he went away for the rendezvous\nbefore us, and arrived there the middle of December; but not liking the\nport, he left a great cross on shore, with directions written on a\nplate of lead fixed to it, for us to come after him to the great bays at\nMangahelly, where he found a very good harbour; but we learned a piece\nof news here that kept us from him a great while, which the admiral took\noffence at; but we stopped his mouth with his share of 200,000 pieces\nof eight to him and his ship's crew. But the story which interrupted\nour coming to him was this. Between Mangahelly and another point, called\nCape St Sebastian, there came on shore in the night an European ship,\nand whether by stress of weather or want of a pilot I know not, but the\nship stranded and could not be got off.\n\nWe lay in the cove or harbour, where, as I have said, our rendezvous\nwas appointed, and had not yet been on shore, so we had not seen the\ndirections our admiral had left for us.\n\nOur friend William, of whom I have said nothing a great while, had a\ngreat mind one day to go on shore, and importuned me to let him have\na little troop to go with him, for safety, that they might see the\ncountry. I was mightily against it for many reasons; but particularly\nI told him he knew the natives were but savages, and they were very\ntreacherous, and I desired him that he would not go; and, had he gone\non much farther, I believe I should have downright refused him, and\ncommanded him not to go.\n\nBut, in order to persuade me to let him go, he told me he would give me\nan account of the reason why he was so importunate. He told me, the last\nnight he had a dream, which was so forcible, and made such an impression\nupon his mind, that he could not be quiet till he had made the proposal\nto me to go; and if I refused him, then he thought his dream was\nsignificant; and if not, then his dream was at an end.\n\nHis dream was, he said, that he went on shore with thirty men, of which\nthe cockswain, he said, was one, upon the island; and that they found a\nmine of gold, and enriched them all. But this was not the main thing, he\nsaid, but that the same morning he had dreamed so, the cockswain came\nto him just then, and told him that he dreamed he went on shore on the\nisland of Madagascar, and that some men came to him and told him they\nwould show him where he should get a prize which would make them all\nrich.\n\nThese two things put together began to weigh with me a little, though I\nwas never inclined to give any heed to dreams; but William's importunity\nturned me effectually, for I always put a great deal of stress upon his\njudgment; so that, in short, I gave them leave to go, but I charged them\nnot to go far off from the sea-coast; that, if they were forced down to\nthe seaside upon any occasion, we might perhaps see them, and fetch them\noff with our boats.\n\nThey went away early in the morning, one-and-thirty men of them in\nnumber, very well armed, and very stout fellows; they travelled all the\nday, and at night made us a signal that all was well, from the top of a\nhill, which we had agreed on, by making a great fire.\n\nNext day they marched down the hill on the other side, inclining towards\nthe seaside, as they had promised, and saw a very pleasant valley before\nthem, with a river in the middle of it, which, a little farther below\nthem, seemed to be big enough to bear small ships; they marched apace\ntowards this river, and were surprised with the noise of a piece going\noff, which, by the sound, could not be far off. They listened long, but\ncould hear no more; so they went on to the river-side, which was a very\nfine fresh stream, but widened apace, and they kept on by the banks of\nit, till, almost at once, it opened or widened into a good large creek\nor harbour, about five miles from the sea; and that which was still more\nsurprising, as they marched forward, they plainly saw in the mouth of\nthe harbour, or creek, the wreck of a ship.\n\nThe tide was up, as we call it, so that it did not appear very much\nabove the water, but, as they made downwards, they found it grow bigger\nand bigger; and the tide soon after ebbing out, they found it lay dry\nupon the sands, and appeared to be the wreck of a considerable vessel,\nlarger than could be expected in that country.\n\nAfter some time, William, taking out his glass to look at it more\nnearly, was surprised with hearing a musket-shot whistle by him, and\nimmediately after that he heard the gun, and saw the smoke from the\nother side; upon which our men immediately fired three muskets, to\ndiscover, if possible, what or who they were. Upon the noise of these\nguns, abundance of men came running down to the shore from among the\ntrees; and our men could easily perceive that they were Europeans,\nthough they knew not of what nation; however, our men hallooed to them\nas loud as they could, and by-and-by they got a long pole, and set it\nup, and hung a white shirt upon it for a flag of truce. They on the\nother side saw it, by the help of their glasses, too, and quickly after\nour men see a boat launch off from the shore, as they thought, but it\nwas from another creek, it seems; and immediately they came rowing over\nthe creek to our men, carrying also a white flag as a token of truce.\n\nIt is not easy to describe the surprise, or joy and satisfaction, that\nappeared on both sides, to see not only white men, but Englishmen, in\na place so remote; but what then must it be when they came to know one\nanother, and to find that they were not only countrymen but comrades,\nand that this was the very ship that Captain Wilmot, our admiral,\ncommanded, and whose company we had lost in the storm at Tobago, after\nmaking an agreement to rendezvous at Madagascar!\n\nThey had, it seems, got intelligence of us when they came to the south\npart of the island, and had been a-roving as far as the Gulf of Bengal,\nwhen they met Captain Avery, with whom they joined, took several rich\nprizes, and, amongst the rest, one ship with the Great Mogul's daughter,\nand an immense treasure in money and jewels; and from thence they came\nabout the coast of Coromandel, and afterwards that of Malabar, into the\nGulf of Persia, where they also took some prize, and then designed for\nthe south part of Madagascar; but the winds blowing hard at S.E. and\nS.E. by E., they came to the northward of the isle, and being after that\nseparated by a furious tempest from the N.W., they were forced into the\nmouth of that creek, where they lost their ship. And they told us, also,\nthat they heard that Captain Avery himself had lost his ship also not\nfar off.\n\nWhen they had thus acquainted one another with their fortunes, the poor\noverjoyed men were in haste to go back to communicate their joy to their\ncomrades; and, leaving some of their men with ours, the rest went back,\nand William was so earnest to see them that he and two more went back\nwith them, and there he came to their little camp where they lived.\nThere were about a hundred and sixty men of them in all; they had got\ntheir guns on shore, and some ammunition, but a good deal of their\npowder was spoiled; however, they had raised a fair platform, and\nmounted twelve pieces of cannon upon it, which was a sufficient defence\nto them on that side of the sea; and just at the end of the platform\nthey had made a launch and a little yard, and were all hard at work,\nbuilding another little ship, as I may call it, to go to sea in; but\nthey put a stop to this work upon the news they had of our being come\nin.\n\nWhen our men went into their huts, it was surprising, indeed, to see the\nvast stock of wealth they had got, in gold and silver and jewels, which,\nhowever, they told us was a trifle to what Captain Avery had, wherever\nhe was gone.\n\nIt was five days we had waited for our men, and no news of them; and\nindeed I gave them over for lost, but was surprised, after five days'\nwaiting, to see a ship's boat come rowing towards us along shore. What\nto make of it I could not tell, but was at least better satisfied when\nour men told me they heard them halloo and saw them wave their caps to\nus.\n\nIn a little time they came quite up to us; and I saw friend William\nstand up in the boat and make signs to us; so they came on board; but\nwhen I saw there were but fifteen of our one-and-thirty men, I asked him\nwhat had become of their fellows. \"Oh,\" says William, \"they are all very\nwell; and my dream is fully made good, and the cockswain's too.\"\n\nThis made me very impatient to know how the case stood; so he told us\nthe whole story, which indeed surprised us all. The next day we weighed,\nand stood away southerly to join Captain Wilmot and ship at Mangahelly,\nwhere we found him, as I said, a little chagrined at our stay; but we\npacified him afterwards with telling him the history of William's dream,\nand the consequence of it.\n\nIn the meantime the camp of our comrades was so near Mangahelly, that\nour admiral and I, friend William, and some of the men, resolved to take\nthe sloop and go and see them, and fetch them all, and their goods,\nbag and baggage, on board our ship, which accordingly we did, and found\ntheir camp, their fortifications, the battery of guns they had erected,\ntheir treasure, and all the men, just as William had related it; so,\nafter some stay, we took all the men into the sloop, and brought them\naway with us.\n\nIt was some time before we knew what was become of Captain Avery; but\nafter about a month, by the direction of the men who had lost their\nship, we sent the sloop to cruise along the shore, to find out, if\npossible, where they were; and in about a week's cruise our men found\nthem, and particularly that they had lost their ship, as well as our men\nhad lost theirs, and that they were every way in as bad a condition as\nours.\n\nIt was about ten days before the sloop returned, and Captain Avery with\nthem; and this was the whole force that, as I remember, Captain Avery\never had with him; for now we joined all our companies together, and it\nstood thus:--We had two ships and a sloop, in which we had 320 men, but\nmuch too few to man them as they ought to be, the great Portuguese ship\nrequiring of herself near 400 men to man her completely. As for\nour lost, but now found comrade, her complement of men was 180, or\nthereabouts; and Captain Avery had about 300 men with him, whereof he\nhad ten carpenters with him, most of which were taken aboard the\nprize they had taken; so that, in a word, all the force Avery had at\nMadagascar, in the year 1699, or thereabouts, amounted to our three\nships, for his own was lost, as you have heard; and never had any more\nthan about 1200 men in all.\n\nIt was about a month after this that all our crews got together, and\nas Avery was unshipped, we all agreed to bring our own company into the\nPortuguese man-of-war and the sloop, and give Captain Avery the Spanish\nfrigate, with all the tackles and furniture, guns and ammunition, for\nhis crew by themselves; for which they, being full of wealth, agreed to\ngive us 40,000 pieces of eight.\n\nIt was next considered what course we should take. Captain Avery, to\ngive him his due, proposed our building a little city here, establishing\nourselves on shore, with a good fortification and works proper to defend\nourselves; and that, as we had wealth enough, and could increase it to\nwhat degree we pleased, we should content ourselves to retire here,\nand bid defiance to the world. But I soon convinced him that this place\nwould be no security to us, if we pretended to carry on our cruising\ntrade; for that then all the nations of Europe, and indeed of that part\nof the world, would be engaged to root us out; but if we resolved to\nlive there as in retirement, and plant in the country as private men,\nand give over our trade of pirating, then, indeed, we might plant and\nsettle ourselves where we pleased. But then, I told him, the best way\nwould be to treat with the natives, and buy a tract of land of them\nfarther up the country, seated upon some navigable river, where boats\nmight go up and down for pleasure, but not ships to endanger us; that\nthus planting the high ground with cattle, such as cows and goats, of\nwhich the country also was full, to be sure we might live here as well\nas any men in the world; and I owned to him I thought it was a good\nretreat for those that were willing to leave off and lay down, and yet\ndid not care to venture home and be hanged; that is to say, to run the\nrisk of it.\n\nCaptain Avery, however he made no positive discovery of his intentions,\nseemed to me to decline my notion of going up into the country to plant;\non the contrary, it was apparent he was of Captain Wilmot's opinion,\nthat they might maintain themselves on shore, and yet carry on their\ncruising trade too; and upon this they resolved. But, as I afterwards\nunderstood, about fifty of their men went up the country, and settled\nthemselves in an inland place as a colony. Whether they are there still\nor not, I cannot tell, or how many of them are left alive; but it is my\nopinion they are there still, and that they are considerably increased,\nfor, as I hear, they have got some women among them, though not many;\nfor it seems five Dutch women and three or four little girls were taken\nby them in a Dutch ship, which they afterwards took going to Mocha; and\nthree of those women, marrying some of these men, went with them to live\nin their new plantation. But of this I speak only by hearsay.\n\nAs we lay here some time, I found our people mightily divided in their\nnotions; some were for going this way, and some that, till at last I\nbegan to foresee they would part company, and perhaps we should not have\nmen enough to keep together to man the great ship; so I took Captain\nWilmot aside, and began to talk to him about it, but soon perceived that\nhe inclined himself to stay at Madagascar, and having got a vast wealth\nfor his own share, had secret designs of getting home some way or other.\n\nI argued the impossibility of it, and the hazard he would run, either\nof falling into the hands of thieves and murderers in the Red Sea,\nwho would never let such a treasure as his pass their hands, or of\nhis falling into the hands of the English, Dutch, or French, who would\ncertainly hang him for a pirate. I gave him an account of the voyage\nI had made from this very place to the continent of Africa, and what a\njourney it was to travel on foot.\n\nIn short, nothing could persuade him, but he would go into the Red Sea\nwith the sloop, and where the children of Israel passed through the sea\ndry-shod, and, landing there, would travel to Grand Cairo by land,\nwhich is not above eighty miles, and from thence he said he could ship\nhimself, by the way of Alexandria, to any part of the world.\n\nI represented the hazard, and indeed the impossibility, of his passing\nby Mocha and Jiddah without being attacked, if he offered it by force,\nor plundered, if he went to get leave; and explained the reasons of it\nso much and so effectually, that, though at last he would not hearken to\nit himself, none of his men would go with him. They told him they would\ngo anywhere with him to serve him, but that this was running himself and\nthem into certain destruction, without any possibility of avoiding it,\nor probability of answering his end. The captain took what I said to\nhim quite wrong, and pretended to resent it, and gave me some buccaneer\nwords upon it; but I gave him no return to it but this: that I advised\nhim for his advantage; that if he did not understand it so, it was his\nfault, not mine; that I did not forbid him to go, nor had I offered\nto persuade any of the men not to go with him, though it was to their\napparent destruction.\n\nHowever, warm heads are not easily cooled. The captain was so eager that\nhe quitted our company, and, with most part of his crew, went over to\nCaptain Avery, and sorted with his people, taking all the treasure with\nhim, which, by the way, was not very fair in him, we having agreed to\nshare all our gains, whether more or less, whether absent or present.\n\nOur men muttered a little at it, but I pacified them as well as I could,\nand told them it was easy for us to get as much, if we minded our hits;\nand Captain Wilmot had set us a very good example; for, by the same\nrule, the agreement of any further sharing of profits with them was at\nan end. I took this occasion to put into their heads some part of my\nfurther designs, which were, to range over the eastern sea, and see if\nwe could not make ourselves as rich as Mr Avery, who, it was true, had\ngotten a prodigious deal of money, though not one-half of what was said\nof it in Europe.\n\nOur men were so pleased with my forward, enterprising temper, that\nthey assured me that they would go with me, one and all, over the whole\nglobe, wherever I would carry them; and as for Captain Wilmot, they\nwould have nothing more to do with him. This came to his ears, and put\nhim into a great rage, so that he threatened, if I came on shore, he\nwould cut my throat.\n\nI had information of it privately, but took no notice of it at all; only\nI took care not to go unprovided for him, and seldom walked about but in\nvery good company. However, at last Captain Wilmot and I met, and talked\nover the matter very seriously, and I offered him the sloop to go where\nhe pleased, or, if he was not satisfied with that, I offered to take\nthe sloop and leave him the great ship; but he declined both, and only\ndesired that I would leave him six carpenters, which I had in our ship\nmore than I had need of, to help his men to finish the sloop that was\nbegun before we came thither, by the men that lost their ship. This I\nconsented readily to, and lent him several other hands that were useful\nto them; and in a little time they built a stout brigantine, able to\ncarry fourteen guns and 200 men.\n\nWhat measures they took, and how Captain Avery managed afterwards, is\ntoo long a story to meddle with here; nor is it any of my business,\nhaving my own story still upon my hands.\n\nWe lay here, about these several simple disputes, almost five months,\nwhen, about the latter end of March, I set sail with the great ship,\nhaving in her forty-four guns and 400 men, and the sloop, carrying\neighty men. We did not steer to the Malabar coast, and so to the Gulf of\nPersia, as was first intended, the east monsoons blowing yet too strong,\nbut we kept more under the African coast, where we had the wind variable\ntill we passed the line, and made the Cape Bassa, in the latitude of\nfour degrees ten minutes; from thence, the monsoons beginning to change\nto the N.E. and N.N.E., we led it away, with the wind large, to the\nMaldives, a famous ledge of islands, well known by all the sailors who\nhave gone into those parts of the world; and, leaving these islands a\nlittle to the south, we made Cape Comorin, the southernmost land of the\ncoast of Malabar, and went round the isle of Ceylon. Here we lay by a\nwhile to wait for purchase; and here we saw three large English East\nIndia ships going from Bengal, or from Fort St George, homeward for\nEngland, or rather for Bombay and Surat, till the trade set in.\n\nWe brought to, and hoisting an English ancient and pendant, lay by for\nthem, as if we intended to attack them. They could not tell what to make\nof us a good while, though they saw our colours; and I believe at first\nthey thought us to be French; but as they came nearer to us, we let\nthem soon see what we were, for we hoisted a black flag, with two cross\ndaggers in it, on our main-top-mast head, which let them see what they\nwere to expect.\n\nWe soon found the effects of this; for at first they spread their\nancients, and made up to us in a line, as if they would fight us, having\nthe wind off shore, fair enough to have brought them on board us; but\nwhen they saw what force we were of, and found we were cruisers of\nanother kind, they stood away from us again, with all the sail they\ncould make. If they had come up, we should have given them an unexpected\nwelcome, but as it was, we had no mind to follow them; so we let them\ngo, for the same reasons which I mentioned before.\n\nBut though we let them pass, we did not design to let others go at so\neasy a price. It was but the next morning that we saw a sail standing\nround Cape Comorin, and steering, as we thought, the same course with\nus. We knew not at first what to do with her, because she had the shore\non her larboard quarter, and if we offered to chase her, she might put\ninto any port or creek, and escape us; but, to prevent this, we sent the\nsloop to get in between her and the land. As soon as she saw that, she\nhauled in to keep the land aboard, and when the sloop stood towards her\nshe made right ashore, with all the canvas she could spread.\n\nThe sloop, however, came up with her and engaged her, and found she was\na vessel of ten guns, Portuguese built, but in the Dutch traders'\nhands, and manned by Dutchmen, who were bound from the Gulf of Persia\nto Batavia, to fetch spices and other goods from thence. The sloop's men\ntook her, and had the rummaging of her before we came up. She had in her\nsome European goods, and a good round sum of money, and some pearl; so\nthat, though we did not go to the gulf for the pearl, the pearl came to\nus out of the gulf, and we had our share of it. This was a rich ship,\nand the goods were of very considerable value, besides the money and the\npearl.\n\nWe had a long consultation here what we should do with the men, for to\ngive them the ship, and let them pursue their voyage to Java, would be\nto alarm the Dutch factory there, who are by far the strongest in the\nIndies, and to make our passage that way impracticable; whereas we\nresolved to visit that part of the world in our way, but were not\nwilling to pass the great Bay of Bengal, where we hoped for a great deal\nof purchase; and therefore it behoved us not to be waylaid before we\ncame there, because they knew we must pass by the Straits of Malacca, or\nthose of Sunda; and either way it was very easy to prevent us.\n\nWhile we were consulting this in the great cabin, the men had had the\nsame debate before the mast; and it seems the majority there were for\npickling up the poor Dutchmen among the herrings; in a word, they were\nfor throwing them all into the sea. Poor William, the Quaker, was in\ngreat concern about this, and comes directly to me to talk about it.\n\"Hark thee,\" says William, \"what wilt thou do with these Dutchmen that\nthou hast on board? Thou wilt not let them go, I suppose,\" says he.\n\"Why,\" says I, \"William, would you advise me to let them go?\" \"No,\" says\nWilliam, \"I cannot say it is fit for thee to let them go; that is to\nsay, to go on with their voyage to Batavia, because it is not for thy\nturn that the Dutch at Batavia should have any knowledge of thy being in\nthese seas.\" \"Well, then,\" says I to him, \"I know no remedy but to throw\nthem overboard. You know, William,\" says I, \"a Dutchman swims like a\nfish; and all our people here are of the same opinion as well as I.\" At\nthe same time I resolved it should not be done, but wanted to hear what\nWilliam would say. He gravely replied, \"If all the men in the ship\nwere of that mind, I will never believe that thou wilt be of that mind\nthyself, for I have heard thee protest against cruelty in all other\ncases.\" \"Well, William,\" says I, \"that is true; but what then shall we\ndo with them?\" \"Why,\" says William, \"is there no way but to murder them?\nI am persuaded thou canst not be in earnest.\" \"No, indeed, William,\"\nsays I, \"I am not in earnest; but they shall not go to Java, no, nor to\nCeylon, that is certain.\" \"But,\" says William, \"the men have done thee\nno injury at all; thou hast taken a great treasure from them; what canst\nthou pretend to hurt them for?\" \"Nay, William,\" says I, \"do not talk of\nthat; I have pretence enough, if that be all; my pretence is, to\nprevent doing me hurt, and that is as necessary a piece of the law of\nself-preservation as any you can name; but the main thing is, I know not\nwhat to do with them, to prevent their prating.\"\n\nWhile William and I were talking, the poor Dutchmen were openly\ncondemned to die, as it may be called, by the whole ship's company; and\nso warm were the men upon it, that they grew very clamorous; and when\nthey heard that William was against it, some of them swore they should\ndie, and if William opposed it, he should drown along with them.\n\nBut, as I was resolved to put an end to their cruel project, so I found\nit was time to take upon me a little, or the bloody humour might grow\ntoo strong; so I called the Dutchmen up, and talked a little with them.\nFirst, I asked them if they were willing to go with us. Two of them\noffered it presently; but the rest, which were fourteen, declined it.\n\"Well, then,\" said I, \"where would you go?\" They desired they should\ngo to Ceylon. No, I told them I could not allow them to go to any Dutch\nfactory, and told them very plainly the reasons of it, which they could\nnot deny to be just. I let them know also the cruel, bloody measures\nof our men, but that I had resolved to save them, if possible; and\ntherefore I told them I would set them on shore at some English factory\nin the Bay of Bengal, or put them on board any English ship I met, after\nI was past the Straits of Sunda or of Malacca, but not before; for, as\nto my coming back again, I told them I would run the venture of their\nDutch power from Batavia, but I would not have the news come there\nbefore me, because it would make all their merchant-ships lay up, and\nkeep out of our way.\n\nIt came next into our consideration what we should do with their ship;\nbut this was not long resolving; for there were but two ways, either to\nset her on fire, or to run her on shore, and we chose the last. So we\nset her foresail with the tack at the cat-head, and lashed her helm a\nlittle to starboard, to answer her head-sail, and so set her agoing,\nwith neither cat or dog in her; and it was not above two hours before\nwe saw her run right ashore upon the coast, a little beyond the\nCape Comorin; and away we went round about Ceylon, for the coast of\nCoromandel.\n\nWe sailed along there, not in sight of the shore only, but so near as to\nsee the ships in the road at Fort St David, Fort St George, and at\nthe other factories along that shore, as well as along the coast of\nGolconda, carrying our English ancient when we came near the Dutch\nfactories, and Dutch colours when we passed by the English factories.\nWe met with little purchase upon this coast, except two small vessels\nof Golconda, bound across the bay with bales of calicoes and muslins and\nwrought silks, and fifteen bales of romals, from the bottom of the bay,\nwhich were going, on whose account we knew not, to Acheen, and to other\nports on the coast of Malacca. We did not inquire to what place in\nparticular; but we let the vessels go, having none but Indians on board.\n\nIn the bottom of the bay we met with a great junk belonging to the\nMogul's court, with a great many people, passengers as we supposed them\nto be: it seems they were bound for the river Hooghly or Ganges, and\ncame from Sumatra. This was a prize worth taking indeed; and we got\nso much gold in her, besides other goods which we did not meddle\nwith--pepper in particular--that it had like to have put an end to our\ncruise; for almost all my men said we were rich enough, and desired to\ngo back again to Madagascar. But I had other things in my head still,\nand when I came to talk with them, and set friend William to talk with\nthem, we put such further golden hopes into their heads that we soon\nprevailed with them to let us go on.\n\nMy next design was to leave all the dangerous straits of Malacca,\nSingapore, and Sunda, where we could expect no great booty, but what we\nmight light on in European ships, which we must fight for; and though we\nwere able to fight, and wanted no courage, even to desperation, yet we\nwere rich too, and resolved to be richer, and took this for our maxim,\nthat while we were sure the wealth we sought was to be had without\nfighting, we had no occasion to put ourselves to the necessity of\nfighting for that which would come upon easy terms.\n\nWe left, therefore, the Bay of Bengal, and coming to the coast of\nSumatra, we put in at a small port, where there was a town, inhabited\nonly by Malays; and here we took in fresh water, and a large quantity of\ngood pork, pickled up and well salted, notwithstanding the heat of the\nclimate, being in the very middle of the torrid zone, viz., in three\ndegrees fifteen minutes north latitude. We also took on board both our\nvessels forty hogs alive, which served us for fresh provisions, having\nabundance of food for them, such as the country produced, such as guams,\npotatoes, and a sort of coarse rice, good for nothing else but to feed\nthe swine. We killed one of these hogs every day, and found them to be\nexcellent meat. We took in also a monstrous quantity of ducks, and cocks\nand hens, the same kind as we have in England, which we kept for change\nof provisions; and if I remember right, we had no less than two thousand\nof them; so that at first we were pestered with them very much, but\nwe soon lessened them by boiling, roasting, stewing, &c., for we never\nwanted while we had them.\n\nMy long-projected design now lay open to me, which was to fall in\namongst the Dutch Spice Islands, and see what mischief I could do there.\nAccordingly, we put out to sea the 12th of August, and passing the line\non the 17th, we stood away due south, leaving the Straits of Sunda and\nthe isle of Java on the east, till we came to the latitude of eleven\ndegrees twenty minutes, when we steered east and E.N.E., having easy\ngales from the W.S.W. till we came among the Moluccas, or Spice Islands.\n\nWe passed those seas with less difficulty than in other places, the\nwinds to the south of Java being more variable, and the weather good,\nthough sometimes we met with squally weather and short storms; but when\nwe came in among the Spice Islands themselves we had a share of the\nmonsoons, or trade-winds, and made use of them accordingly.\n\nThe infinite number of islands which lie in these seas embarrassed\nus strangely, and it was with great difficulty that we worked our way\nthrough them; then we steered for the north side of the Philippines,\nwhen we had a double chance for purchase, viz., either to meet with\nthe Spanish ships from Acapulco, on the coast of New Spain, or we were\ncertain not to fail of finding some ships or junks of China, who, if\nthey came from China, would have a great quantity of goods of value on\nboard, as well as money; or if we took them going back, we should find\nthem laden with nutmegs and cloves from Banda and Ternate, or from some\nof the other islands.\n\nWe were right in our guesses here to a tittle, and we steered directly\nthrough a large outlet, which they call a strait, though it be fifteen\nmiles broad, and to an island they call Dammer, and from thence N.N.E.\nto Banda. Between these islands we met with a Dutch junk, or vessel,\ngoing to Amboyna: we took her without much trouble, and I had much ado\nto prevent our men murdering all the men, as soon as they heard them say\nthey belonged to Amboyna: the reasons I suppose any one will guess.\n\nWe took out of her about sixteen ton of nutmegs, some provisions, and\ntheir small-arms, for they had no great guns, and let the ship go: from\nthence we sailed directly to the Banda Island, or Islands, where we\nwere sure to get more nutmegs if we thought fit. For my part, I would\nwillingly have got more nutmegs, though I had paid for them, but our\npeople abhorred paying for anything; so we got about twelve ton more at\nseveral times, most of them from shore, and only a few in a small boat\nof the natives, which was going to Gilolo. We would have traded openly,\nbut the Dutch, who have made themselves masters of all those islands,\nforbade the people dealing with us, or any strangers whatever, and kept\nthem so in awe that they durst not do it; so we could indeed have made\nnothing of it if we had stayed longer, and therefore resolved to be gone\nfor Ternate, and see if we could make up our loading with cloves.\n\nAccordingly we stood away north, but found ourselves so entangled among\ninnumerable islands, and without any pilot that understood the channel\nand races between them, that we were obliged to give it over, and\nresolved to go back again to Banda, and see what we could get among the\nother islands thereabouts.\n\nThe first adventure we made here had like to have been fatal to us all,\nfor the sloop, being ahead, made the signal to us for seeing a sail, and\nafterwards another, and a third, by which we understood she saw three\nsail; whereupon we made more sail to come up with her, but on a sudden\nwere gotten among some rocks, falling foul upon them in such a manner\nas frighted us all very heartily; for having, it seems, but just water\nenough, as it were to an inch, our rudder struck upon the top of a rock,\nwhich gave us a terrible shock, and split a great piece off the rudder,\nand indeed disabled it so that our ship would not steer at all, at least\nnot so as to be depended upon; and we were glad to hand all our sails,\nexcept our fore-sail and main-topsail, and with them we stood away to\nthe east, to see if we could find any creek or harbour where we might\nlay the ship on shore, and repair our rudder; besides, we found the ship\nherself had received some damage, for she had some little leak near her\nstern-post, but a great way under water.\n\nBy this mischance we lost the advantages, whatever they were, of the\nthree sail of ships, which we afterwards came to hear were small Dutch\nships from Batavia, going to Banda and Amboyna, to load spice, and, no\ndoubt, had a good quantity of money on board.\n\nUpon the disaster I have been speaking of you may very well suppose that\nwe came to an anchor as soon as we could, which was upon a small island\nnot far from Banda, where, though the Dutch keep no factory, yet they\ncome at the season to buy nutmegs and mace. We stayed there thirteen\ndays; but there being no place where we could lay the ship on shore, we\nsent the sloop to cruise among the islands, to look out for a place fit\nfor us. In the meantime we got very good water here, some provisions,\nroots, and fruits, and a good quantity of nutmegs and mace, which we\nfound ways to trade with the natives for, without the knowledge of their\nmasters, the Dutch.\n\nAt length our sloop returned; having found another island where\nthere was a very good harbour, we ran in, and came to an anchor. We\nimmediately unbent all our sails, sent them ashore upon the island, and\nset up seven or eight tents with them; then we unrigged our top-masts,\nand cut them down, hoisted all our guns out, our provisions and loading,\nand put them ashore in the tents. With the guns we made two small\nbatteries, for fear of a surprise, and kept a look-out upon the hill.\nWhen we were all ready, we laid the ship aground upon a hard sand, the\nupper end of the harbour, and shored her up on each side. At low water\nshe lay almost dry, so we mended her bottom, and stopped the leak, which\nwas occasioned by straining some of the rudder irons with the shock\nwhich the ship had against the rock.\n\nHaving done this, we also took occasion to clean her bottom, which,\nhaving been at sea so long, was very foul. The sloop washed and tallowed\nalso, but was ready before us, and cruised eight or ten days among the\nislands, but met with no purchase; so that we began to be tired of the\nplace, having little to divert us but the most furious claps of thunder\nthat ever were heard or read of in the world.\n\nWe were in hopes to have met with some purchase here among the Chinese,\nwho, we had been told, came to Ternate to trade for cloves, and to the\nBanda Isles for nutmegs; and we would have been very glad to have loaded\nour galleon, or great ship, with these two sorts of spice, and have\nthought it a glorious voyage; but we found nothing stirring more than\nwhat I have said, except Dutchmen, who, by what means we could not\nimagine, had either a jealousy of us or intelligence of us, and kept\nthemselves close in their ports.\n\nI was once resolved to have made a descent at the island of Dumas, the\nplace most famous for the best nutmegs; but friend William, who was\nalways for doing our business without fighting, dissuaded me from it,\nand gave such reasons for it that we could not resist; particularly\nthe great heats of the season, and of the place, for we were now in the\nlatitude of just half a degree south. But while we were disputing this\npoint we were soon determined by the following accident:--We had a\nstrong gale of wind at S.W. by W., and the ship had fresh way, but a\ngreat sea rolling in upon us from the N.E., which we afterwards found\nwas the pouring in of the great ocean east of New Guinea. However, as I\nsaid, we stood away large, and made fresh way, when, on the sudden,\nfrom a dark cloud which hovered over our heads, came a flash, or rather\nblast, of lightning, which was so terrible, and quivered so long among\nus, that not I only, but all our men, thought the ship was on fire. The\nheat of the flash, or fire, was so sensibly felt in our faces, that some\nof our men had blisters raised by it on their skins, not immediately,\nperhaps, by the heat, but by the poisonous or noxious particles which\nmixed themselves with the matter inflamed. But this was not all; the\nshock of the air, which the fracture in the clouds made, was such\nthat our ship shook as when a broadside is fired; and her motion being\nchecked, as it were at once, by a repulse superior to the force that\ngave her way before, the sails all flew back in a moment, and the ship\nlay, as we might truly say, thunder-struck. As the blast from the cloud\nwas so very near us, it was but a few moments after the flash that the\nterriblest clap of thunder followed that was ever heard by mortals. I\nfirmly believe a blast of a hundred thousand barrels of gunpowder could\nnot have been greater to our hearing; nay, indeed, to some of our men it\ntook away their hearing.\n\nIt is not possible for me to describe, or any one to conceive, the\nterror of that minute. Our men were in such a consternation, that not a\nman on board the ship had presence of mind to apply to the proper duty\nof a sailor, except friend William; and had he not run very nimbly,\nand with a composure that I am sure I was not master of, to let go the\nfore-sheet, set in the weather-brace of the fore-yard, and haul down\nthe top-sails, we had certainly brought all our masts by the board, and\nperhaps have been overwhelmed in the sea.\n\nAs for myself, I must confess my eyes were open to my danger, though not\nthe least to anything of application for remedy. I was all amazement and\nconfusion, and this was the first time that I can say I began to feel\nthe effects of that horror which I know since much more of, upon the\njust reflection on my former life. I thought myself doomed by Heaven to\nsink that moment into eternal destruction; and with this peculiar mark\nof terror, viz., that the vengeance was not executed in the ordinary\nway of human justice, but that God had taken me into His immediate\ndisposing, and had resolved to be the executer of His own vengeance.\n\nLet them alone describe the confusion I was in who know what was the\ncase of [John] Child, of Shadwell, or Francis Spira. It is impossible\nto describe it. My soul was all amazement and surprise. I thought myself\njust sinking into eternity, owning the divine justice of my punishment,\nbut not at all feeling any of the moving, softening tokens of a sincere\npenitent; afflicted at the punishment, but not at the crime; alarmed at\nthe vengeance, but not terrified at the guilt; having the same gust to\nthe crime, though terrified to the last degree at the thought of the\npunishment, which I concluded I was just now going to receive.\n\nBut perhaps many that read this will be sensible of the thunder and\nlightning, that may think nothing of the rest, or rather may make a jest\nof it all; so I say no more of it at this time, but proceed to the story\nof the voyage. When the amazement was over, and the men began to come\nto themselves, they fell a-calling for one another, every one for his\nfriend, or for those he had most respect for; and it was a singular\nsatisfaction to find that nobody was hurt. The next thing was to\ninquire if the ship had received no damage, when the boatswain, stepping\nforward, found that part of the head was gone, but not so as to\nendanger the bowsprit; so we hoisted our top-sails again, hauled aft the\nfore-sheet, braced the yards, and went our course as before. Nor can I\ndeny but that we were all somewhat like the ship; our first astonishment\nbeing a little over, and that we found the ship swim again, we were soon\nthe same irreligious, hardened crew that we were before, and I among the\nrest.\n\nAs we now steered, our course lay N.N.E., and we passed thus, with a\nfair wind, through the strait or channel between the island of Gilolo\nand the land of Nova Guinea, when we were soon in the open sea or ocean,\non the south-east of the Philippines, being the great Pacific, or South\nSea, where it may be said to join itself with the vast Indian Ocean.\n\nAs we passed into these seas, steering due north, so we soon crossed the\nline to the north side, and so sailed on towards Mindanao and Manilla,\nthe chief of the Philippine Islands, without meeting with any purchase\ntill we came to the northward of Manilla, and then our trade began;\nfor here we took three Japanese vessels, though at some distance from\nManilla. Two of them had made their market, and were going home with\nnutmegs, cinnamon, cloves, &c., besides all sorts of European goods,\nbrought with the Spanish ships from Acapulco. They had together\neight-and-thirty ton of cloves, and five or six ton of nutmegs, and as\nmuch cinnamon. We took the spice, but meddled with very little of the\nEuropean goods, they being, as we thought, not worth our while; but we\nwere very sorry for it soon after, and therefore grew wiser upon the\nnext occasion.\n\nThe third Japanese was the best prize to us; for he came with money, and\na great deal of gold uncoined, to buy such goods as we mentioned above.\nWe eased him of his gold, and did him no other harm, and having no\nintention to stay long here, we stood away for China.\n\nWe were at sea above two months upon this voyage, beating it up against\nthe wind, which blew steadily from the N.E., and within a point or two\none way or other; and this indeed was the reason why we met with the\nmore prizes in our voyage.\n\nWe were just gotten clear of the Philippines, and we purposed to go to\nthe isle of Formosa, but the wind blew so fresh at N.N.E. that there was\nno making anything of it, and we were forced to put back to Laconia, the\nmost northerly of those islands. We rode here very secure, and shifted\nour situation, not in view of any danger, for there was none, but for a\nbetter supply of provisions, which we found the people very willing to\nsupply us with.\n\nThere lay, while we remained here, three very great galleons, or Spanish\nships, from the south seas; whether newly come in or ready to sail we\ncould not understand at first; but as we found the China traders began\nto load and set forward to the north, we concluded the Spanish ships had\nnewly unloaded their cargo, and these had been buying; so we doubted\nnot but we should meet with purchase in the rest of the voyage, neither,\nindeed, could we well miss of it.\n\nWe stayed here till the beginning of May, when we were told the Chinese\ntraders would set forward; for the northern monsoons end about the\nlatter end of March or beginning of April; so that they are sure of fair\nwinds home. Accordingly we hired some of the country boats, which\nare very swift sailers, to go and bring us word how affairs stood at\nManilla, and when the China junks would sail; and by this intelligence\nwe ordered our matters so well, that three days after we set sail we\nfell in with no less than eleven of them; out of which, however, having\nby misfortune of discovering ourselves, taken but three, we contented\nourselves and pursued our voyage to Formosa. In these three vessels we\ntook, in short, such a quantity of cloves, nutmegs, cinnamon, and mace,\nbesides silver, that our men began to be of my opinion,--that we were\nrich enough; and, in short, we had nothing to do now but to consider by\nwhat methods to secure the immense treasure we had got.\n\nI was secretly glad to hear that they were of this opinion, for I had\nlong before resolved, if it were possible, to persuade them to think of\nreturning, having fully perfected my first projected design of rummaging\namong the Spice Islands; and all those prizes, which were exceeding rich\nat Manilla, was quite beyond my design.\n\nBut now I had heard what the men said, and how they thought we were very\nwell, I let them know by friend William, that I intended only to sail\nto the island of Formosa, where I should find opportunity to turn our\nspices and Europe goods into ready money, and that then I would tack\nabout for the south, the northern monsoons being perhaps by that time\nalso ready to set in. They all approved of my design, and willingly\nwent forward; because, besides the winds, which would not permit until\nOctober to go to the south, I say, besides this, we were now a very deep\nship, having near two hundred ton of goods on board, and particularly,\nsome very valuable; the sloop also had a proportion.\n\nWith this resolution we went on cheerfully, when, within about twelve\ndays' sail more, we made the island Formosa, at a great distance, but\nwere ourselves shot beyond the southernmost part of the island, being to\nleeward, and almost upon the coast of China. Here we were a little at\na loss, for the English factories were not far off, and we might be\nobliged to fight some of their ships, if we met with them; which, though\nwe were able enough to do, yet we did not desire it on many accounts,\nand particularly because we did not think it was our business to have it\nknown who we were, or that such a kind of people as we had been seen on\nthe coast. However, we were obliged to keep to the northward, keeping as\ngood an offing as we could with respect to the coast of China.\n\nWe had not sailed long but we chased a small Chinese junk, and having\ntaken her, we found she was bound to the island of Formosa, having no\ngoods on board but some rice and a small quantity of tea; but she had\nthree Chinese merchants in her; and they told us that they were going to\nmeet a large vessel of their country, which came from Tonquin, and lay\nin a river in Formosa, whose name I forgot; and they were going to the\nPhilippine Islands, with silks, muslins, calicoes, and such goods as\nare the product of China, and some gold; that their business was to sell\ntheir cargo, and buy spices and European goods.\n\nThis suited very well with our purpose; so I resolved now that we would\nleave off being pirates and turn merchants; so we told them what goods\nwe had on board, and that if they would bring their supercargoes or\nmerchants on board, we would trade with them. They were very willing\nto trade with us, but terribly afraid to trust us; nor was it an unjust\nfear, for we had plundered them already of what they had. On the other\nhand, we were as diffident as they, and very uncertain what to do; but\nWilliam the Quaker put this matter into a way of barter. He came to me\nand told me he really thought the merchants looked like fair men, that\nmeant honestly. \"And besides,\" says William, \"it is their interest to be\nhonest now, for, as they know upon what terms we got the goods we are to\ntruck with them, so they know we can afford good pennyworths; and in the\nnext place, it saves them going the whole voyage, so that the southerly\nmonsoons yet holding, if they traded with us, they could immediately\nreturn with their cargo to China;\" though, by the way, we afterwards\nfound they intended for Japan; but that was all one, for by this means\nthey saved at least eight months' voyage. Upon these foundations,\nWilliam said he was satisfied we might trust them; \"for,\" says William,\n\"I would as soon trust a man whose interest binds him to be just to\nme as a man whose principle binds himself.\" Upon the whole, William\nproposed that two of the merchants should be left on board our ship as\nhostages, and that part of our goods should be loaded in their vessel,\nand let the third go with it into the port where their ship lay; and\nwhen he had delivered the spices, he should bring back such things as it\nwas agreed should be exchanged. This was concluded on, and William the\nQuaker ventured to go along with them, which, upon my word, I should not\nhave cared to have done, nor was I willing that he should, but he went\nstill upon the notion that it was their interest to treat him friendly.\n\nIn the meantime, we came to an anchor under a little island in the\nlatitude of 23 degrees 28 minutes, being just under the northern tropic,\nand about twenty leagues from the island. Here we lay thirteen days, and\nbegan to be very uneasy for my friend William, for they had promised\nto be back again in four days, which they might very easily have done.\nHowever, at the end of thirteen days, we saw three sail coming directly\nto us, which a little surprised us all at first, not knowing what might\nbe the case; and we began to put ourselves in a posture of defence; but\nas they came nearer us, we were soon satisfied, for the first vessel was\nthat which William went in, who carried a flag of truce; and in a few\nhours they all came to an anchor, and William came on board us with a\nlittle boat, with the Chinese merchant in his company, and two other\nmerchants, who seemed to be a kind of brokers for the rest.\n\nHere he gave us an account how civilly he had been used; how they had\ntreated him with all imaginable frankness and openness; that they had\nnot only given him the full value of his spices and other goods which he\ncarried, in gold, by good weight, but had loaded the vessel again with\nsuch goods as he knew we were willing to trade for; and that afterwards\nthey had resolved to bring the great ship out of the harbour, to lie\nwhere we were, that so we might make what bargain we thought fit;\nonly William said he had promised, in our name, that we should use no\nviolence with them, nor detain any of the vessels after we had done\ntrading with them. I told him we would strive to outdo them in civility,\nand that we would make good every part of his agreement; in token\nwhereof, I caused a white flag likewise to be spread at the poop of our\ngreat ship, which was the signal agreed on.\n\nAs to the third vessel which came with them, it was a kind of bark of\nthe country, who, having intelligence of our design to traffic, came\noff to deal with us, bringing a great deal of gold and some provisions,\nwhich at that time we were very glad of.\n\nIn short, we traded upon the high seas with these men, and indeed we\nmade a very good market, and yet sold thieves' pennyworths too. We sold\nhere about sixty ton of spice, chiefly cloves and nutmegs, and above two\nhundred bales of European goods, such as linen and woollen manufactures.\nWe considered we should have occasion for some such things ourselves,\nand so we kept a good quantity of English stuffs, cloth, baize, &c., for\nourselves. I shall not take up any of the little room I have left here\nwith the further particulars of our trade; it is enough to mention,\nthat, except a parcel of tea, and twelve bales of fine China wrought\nsilks, we took nothing in exchange for our goods but gold; so that the\nsum we took here in that glittering commodity amounted to above fifty\nthousand ounces good weight.\n\nWhen we had finished our barter, we restored the hostages, and gave the\nthree merchants about the quantity of twelve hundredweight of nutmegs,\nand as many of cloves, with a handsome present of European linen and\nstuff for themselves, as a recompense for what we had taken from them;\nso we sent them away exceedingly well satisfied.\n\nHere it was that William gave me an account, that while he was on board\nthe Japanese vessel, he met with a kind of religious, or Japan priest,\nwho spoke some words of English to him; and, being very inquisitive to\nknow how he came to learn any of those words, he told him that there\nwas in his country thirteen Englishmen; he called them Englishmen\nvery articulately and distinctly, for he had conversed with them very\nfrequently and freely. He said that they were all that were left of\ntwo-and-thirty men, who came on shore on the north side of Japan, being\ndriven upon a great rock in a stormy night, where they lost their ship,\nand the rest of their men were drowned; that he had persuaded the king\nof his country to send boats off to the rock or island where the ship\nwas lost, to save the rest of the men, and to bring them on shore, which\nwas done, and they were used very kindly, and had houses built for\nthem, and land given them to plant for provision; and that they lived by\nthemselves.\n\nHe said he went frequently among them, to persuade them to worship their\ngod (an idol, I suppose, of their own making), which, he said, they\nungratefully refused; and that therefore the king had once or twice\nordered them all to be put to death; but that, as he said, he had\nprevailed upon the king to spare them, and let them live their own\nway, as long as they were quiet and peaceable, and did not go about to\nwithdraw others from the worship of the country.\n\nI asked William why he did not inquire from whence they came. \"I did,\"\nsaid William; \"for how could I but think it strange,\" said he, \"to hear\nhim talk of Englishmen on the north side of Japan?\" \"Well,\" said I,\n\"what account did he give of it?\" \"An account,\" said William, \"that will\nsurprise thee, and all the world after thee, that shall hear of it,\nand which makes me wish thou wouldst go up to Japan and find them\nout.\" \"What do you mean?\" said I. \"Whence could they come?\" \"Why,\" says\nWilliam, \"he pulled out a little book, and in it a piece of paper, where\nit was written, in an Englishman's hand, and in plain English words,\nthus; and,\" says William, \"I read it myself:--'We came from Greenland,\nand from the North Pole.'\" This, indeed, was amazing to us all, and more\nso to those seamen among us who knew anything of the infinite attempts\nwhich had been made from Europe, as well by the English as the Dutch,\nto discover a passage that way into those parts of the world; and as\nWilliam pressed as earnestly to go on to the north to rescue those poor\nmen, so the ship's company began to incline to it; and, in a word, we\nall came to this, that we would stand in to the shore of Formosa, to\nfind this priest again, and have a further account of it all from him.\nAccordingly, the sloop went over; but when they came there, the vessels\nwere very unhappily sailed, and this put an end to our inquiry after\nthem, and perhaps may have disappointed mankind of one of the most noble\ndiscoveries that ever was made, or will again be made, in the world, for\nthe good of mankind in general; but so much for that.\n\nWilliam was so uneasy at losing this opportunity, that he pressed us\nearnestly to go up to Japan to find out these men. He told us that if\nit was nothing but to recover thirteen honest poor men from a kind of\ncaptivity, which they would otherwise never be redeemed from, and where,\nperhaps, they might, some time or other, be murdered by the barbarous\npeople, in defence of their idolatry, it were very well worth our while,\nand it would be, in some measure, making amends for the mischiefs we had\ndone in the world; but we, that had no concern upon us for the mischiefs\nwe had done, had much less about any satisfactions to be made for it, so\nhe found that kind of discourse would weigh very little with us. Then\nhe pressed us very earnestly to let him have the sloop to go by himself,\nand I told him I would not oppose it; but when he came to the sloop none\nof the men would go with him; for the case was plain, they had all a\nshare in the cargo of the great ship, as well as in that of the sloop,\nand the richness of the cargo was such that they would not leave it by\nany means; so poor William, much to his mortification, was obliged to\ngive it over. What became of those thirteen men, or whether they are not\nthere still, I can give no account of.\n\nWe are now at the end of our cruise; what we had taken was indeed so\nconsiderable, that it was not only enough to satisfy the most covetous\nand the most ambitious minds in the world, but it did indeed satisfy\nus, and our men declared they did not desire any more. The next motion,\ntherefore, was about going back, and the way by which we should perform\nthe voyage, so as not to be attacked by the Dutch in the Straits of\nSunda.\n\nWe had pretty well stored ourselves here with provisions, and it being\nnow near the return of the monsoons, we resolved to stand away to the\nsouthward; and not only to keep without the Philippine Islands, that is\nto say, to the eastward of them, but to keep on to the southward, and\nsee if we could not leave not only the Moluccas, or Spice Islands,\nbehind us, but even Nova Guinea and Nova Hollandia also; and so getting\ninto the variable winds, to the south of the tropic of Capricorn, steer\naway to the west, over the great Indian Ocean.\n\nThis was indeed at first a monstrous voyage in its appearance, and the\nwant of provisions threatened us. William told us in so many words, that\nit was impossible we could carry provisions enough to subsist us for\nsuch a voyage, and especially fresh water; and that, as there would\nbe no land for us to touch at where we could get any supply, it was a\nmadness to undertake it.\n\nBut I undertook to remedy this evil, and therefore desired them not\nto be uneasy at that, for I knew that we might supply ourselves at\nMindanao, the most southerly island of the Philippines.\n\nAccordingly, we set sail, having taken all the provisions here that we\ncould get, the 28th of September, the wind veering a little at first\nfrom the N.N.W. to the N.E. by E., but afterwards settled about the\nN.E. and the E.N.E. We were nine weeks in this voyage, having met with\nseveral interruptions by the weather, and put in under the lee of a\nsmall island in the latitude of 16 degrees 12 minutes, of which we never\nknew the name, none of our charts having given any account of it: I\nsay, we put in here by reason of a strange tornado or hurricane, which\nbrought us into a great deal of danger. Here we rode about sixteen days,\nthe winds being very tempestuous and the weather uncertain. However, we\ngot some provisions on shore, such as plants and roots, and a few hogs.\nWe believed there were inhabitants on the island, but we saw none of\nthem.\n\nFrom hence, the weather settling again, we went on and came to the\nsouthernmost part of Mindanao, where we took in fresh water and some\ncows, but the climate was so hot that we did not attempt to salt up any\nmore than so as to keep a fortnight or three weeks; and away we stood\nsouthward, crossing the line, and, leaving Gillolo on the starboard\nside, we coasted the country they call New Guinea, where, in the\nlatitude of eight degrees south, we put in again for provisions and\nwater, and where we found inhabitants; but they fled from us, and were\naltogether inconversable. From thence, sailing still southward, we left\nall behind us that any of our charts and maps took any notice of, and\nwent on till we came to the latitude of seventeen degrees, the wind\ncontinuing still north-east.\n\nHere we made land to the westward, which, when we had kept in sight\nfor three days, coasting along the shore for the distance of about four\nleagues, we began to fear we should find no outlet west, and so should\nbe obliged to go back again, and put in among the Moluccas at last; but\nat length we found the land break off, and go trending away to the west\nsea, seeming to be all open to the south and south-west, and a great sea\ncame rolling out of the south, which gave us to understand that there\nwas no land for a great way.\n\nIn a word, we kept on our course to the south, a little westerly, till\nwe passed the south tropic, where we found the winds variable; and now\nwe stood away fair west, and held it out for about twenty days, when we\ndiscovered land right ahead, and on our larboard bow; we made directly\nto the shore, being willing to take all advantages now for supplying\nourselves with fresh provisions and water, knowing we were now entering\non that vast unknown Indian Ocean, perhaps the greatest sea on the\nglobe, having, with very little interruption of islands, a continued sea\nquite round the globe.\n\nWe found a good road here, and some people on shore; but when we landed,\nthey fled up the country, nor would they hold any correspondence with\nus, nor come near us, but shot at us several times with arrows as long\nas lances. We set up white flags for a truce, but they either did not\nor would not understand it; on the contrary, they shot our flag of truce\nthrough several times with their arrows, so that, in a word, we never\ncame near any of them.\n\nWe found good water here, though it was something difficult to get at\nit, but for living creatures we could see none; for the people, if\nthey had any cattle, drove them all away, and showed us nothing but\nthemselves, and that sometimes in a threatening posture, and in number\nso great, that made us suppose the island to be greater than we first\nimagined. It is true, they would not come near enough for us to engage\nwith them, at least not openly; but they came near enough for us to see\nthem, and, by the help of our glasses, to see that they were clothed and\narmed, but their clothes were only about their lower and middle parts;\nthat they had long lances, half pikes, in their hands, besides bows\nand arrows; that they had great high things on their heads, made, as we\nbelieved, of feathers, and which looked something like our grenadiers'\ncaps in England.\n\nWhen we saw them so shy that they would not come near us, our men began\nto range over the island, if it was such (for we never surrounded it),\nto search for cattle, and for any of the Indian plantations, for fruits\nor plants; but they soon found, to their cost, that they were to use\nmore caution than that came to, and that they were to discover perfectly\nevery bush and every tree before they ventured abroad in the country;\nfor about fourteen of our men going farther than the rest, into a part\nof the country which seemed to be planted, as they thought, for it did\nbut seem so, only I think it was overgrown with canes, such as we make\nour cane chairs with--I say, venturing too far, they were suddenly\nattacked with a shower of arrows from almost every side of them, as they\nthought, out of the tops of the trees.\n\nThey had nothing to do but to fly for it, which, however, they could not\nresolve on, till five of them were wounded; nor had they escaped so, if\none of them had not been so much wiser or thoughtfuller than the rest,\nas to consider, that though they could not see the enemy, so as to shoot\nat them, yet perhaps the noise of their shot might terrify them, and\nthat they should rather fire at a venture. Accordingly, ten of them\nfaced about, and fired at random anywhere among the canes.\n\nThe noise and the fire not only terrified the enemy, but, as they\nbelieved, their shot had luckily hit some of them; for they found not\nonly that the arrows, which came thick among them before, ceased, but\nthey heard the Indians halloo, after their way, to one another, and make\na strange noise, more uncouth and inimitably strange than any they had\never heard, more like the howling and barking of wild creatures in the\nwoods than like the voice of men, only that sometimes they seemed to\nspeak words.\n\nThey observed also, that this noise of the Indians went farther and\nfarther off, so that they were satisfied the Indians fled away, except\non one side, where they heard a doleful groaning and howling, and where\nit continued a good while, which they supposed was from some or other\nof them being wounded, and howling by reason of their wounds; or\nkilled, and others howling over them: but our men had enough of making\ndiscoveries; so they did not trouble themselves to look farther, but\nresolved to take this opportunity to retreat. But the worst of\ntheir adventure was to come; for as they came back, they passed by a\nprodigious great trunk of an old tree; what tree it was, they said, they\ndid not know, but it stood like an old decayed oak in a park, where the\nkeepers in England take a stand, as they call it, to shoot a deer; and\nit stood just under the steep side of a great rock, or hill, that our\npeople could not see what was beyond it.\n\nAs they came by this tree, they were of a sudden shot at, from the top\nof the tree, with seven arrows and three lances, which, to our great\ngrief, killed two of our men, and wounded three more. This was the more\nsurprising, because, being without any defence, and so near the trees,\nthey expected more lances and arrows every moment; nor would flying do\nthem any service, the Indians being, as appeared, very good marksmen.\nIn this extremity, they had happily this presence of mind, viz., to run\nclose to the tree, and stand, as it were, under it; so that those above\ncould not come at, or see them, to throw their lances at them. This\nsucceeded, and gave them time to consider what to do; they knew their\nenemies and murderers were above; they heard them talk, and those above\nknew those were below; but they below were obliged to keep close for\nfear of their lances from above. At length, one of our men, looking a\nlittle more strictly than the rest, thought he saw the head of one of\nthe Indians just over a dead limb of the tree, which, it seems, the\ncreature sat upon. One man immediately fired, and levelled his piece so\ntrue that the shot went through the fellow's head; and down he fell out\nof the tree immediately, and came upon the ground with such force, with\nthe height of his fall, that if he had not been killed with the shot,\nhe would certainly have been killed with dashing his body against the\nground.\n\nThis so frightened them, that, besides the howling noise they made in\nthe tree, our men heard a strange clutter of them in the body of the\ntree, from whence they concluded they had made the tree hollow, and were\ngot to hide themselves there. Now, had this been the case, they were\nsecure enough from our men, for it was impossible any of our men could\nget up the tree on the outside, there being no branches to climb by;\nand, to shoot at the tree, that they tried several times to no purpose,\nfor the tree was so thick that no shot would enter it. They made no\ndoubt, however, but that they had their enemies in a trap, and that a\nsmall siege would either bring them down, tree and all, or starve them\nout; so they resolved to keep their post, and send to us for\nhelp. Accordingly, two of them came away to us for more hands, and\nparticularly desired that some of our carpenters might come with tools,\nto help to cut down the tree, or at least to cut down other wood and set\nfire to it; and that, they concluded, would not fail to bring them out.\n\nAccordingly, our men went like a little army, and with mighty\npreparations for an enterprise, the like of which has scarce been ever\nheard, to form the siege of a great tree. However, when they came there,\nthey found the task difficult enough, for the old trunk was indeed a\nvery great one, and very tall, being at least two-and-twenty feet high,\nwith seven old limbs standing out every way from the top, but decayed,\nand very few leaves, if any, left on it.\n\nWilliam the Quaker, whose curiosity led him to go among the rest,\nproposed that they should make a ladder, and get upon the top, and then\nthrow wild-fire into the tree, and smoke them out. Others proposed going\nback, and getting a great gun out of the ship, which would split the\ntree in pieces with the iron bullets; others, that they should cut down\na great deal of wood, and pile it up round the tree, and set it on fire,\nand burn the tree, and the Indians in it.\n\nThese consultations took up our people no less than two or three days,\nin all which time they heard nothing of the supposed garrison within\nthis wooden castle, nor any noise within. William's project was first\ngone about, and a large strong ladder was made, to scale this wooden\ntower; and in two or three hours' time it would have been ready to\nmount, when, on a sudden, they heard the noise of the Indians in the\nbody of the tree again, and a little after, several of them appeared at\nthe top of the tree, and threw some lances down at our men; one of which\nstruck one of our seamen a-top of the shoulder, and gave him such\na desperate wound, that the surgeons not only had a great deal of\ndifficulty to cure him, but the poor man endured such horrible torture,\nthat we all said they had better have killed him outright. However, he\nwas cured at last, though he never recovered the perfect use of his arm,\nthe lance having cut some of the tendons on the top of the arm, near the\nshoulder, which, as I supposed, performed the office of motion to the\nlimb before; so that the poor man was a cripple all the days of his\nlife. But to return to the desperate rogues in the tree; our men shot at\nthem, but did not find they had hit them, or any of them; but as soon as\never they shot at them, they could hear them huddle down into the trunk\nof the tree again, and there, to be sure, they were safe.\n\nWell, however, it was this which put by the project of William's ladder;\nfor when it was done, who would venture up among such a troop of bold\ncreatures as were there, and who, they supposed, were desperate by their\ncircumstances? And as but one man at a time could go up, they began to\nthink it would not do; and, indeed, I was of the opinion (for about this\ntime I was come to their assistance) that going up the ladder would not\ndo, unless it was thus, that a man should, as it were, run just up to\nthe top, and throw some fireworks into the tree, and come down again;\nand this we did two or three times, but found no effect of it. At\nlast, one of our gunners made a stink-pot, as we called it, being a\ncomposition which only smokes, but does not flame or burn; but withal\nthe smoke of it is so thick, and the smell of it so intolerably\nnauseous, that it is not to be suffered. This he threw into the tree\nhimself, and we waited for the effect of it, but heard or saw nothing\nall that night or the next day; so we concluded the men within were all\nsmothered; when, on a sudden, the next night we heard them upon the top\nof the tree again shouting and hallooing like madmen.\n\nWe concluded, as anybody would, that this was to call for help, and we\nresolved to continue our siege; for we were all enraged to see ourselves\nso baulked by a few wild people, whom we thought we had safe in our\nclutches; and, indeed, never were there so many concurring circumstances\nto delude men in any case we had met with. We resolved, however, to try\nanother stink-pot the next night, and our engineer and gunner had got it\nready, when, hearing a noise of the enemy on the top of the tree, and\nin the body of the tree, I was not willing to let the gunner go up the\nladder, which, I said, would be but to be certain of being murdered.\nHowever, he found a medium for it, and that was to go up a few steps,\nand, with a long pole in his hand, to throw it in upon the top of the\ntree, the ladder being standing all this while against the top of the\ntree; but when the gunner, with his machine at the top of his pole, came\nto the tree, with three other men to help him, behold the ladder was\ngone.\n\nThis perfectly confounded us; and we now concluded the Indians in the\ntree had, by this piece of negligence, taken the opportunity, and come\nall down the ladder, made their escape, and had carried away the ladder\nwith them. I laughed most heartily at my friend William, who, as I\nsaid, had the direction of the siege, and had set up a ladder for the\ngarrison, as we called them, to get down upon, and run away. But when\ndaylight came, we were all set to rights again; for there stood our\nladder, hauled up on the top of the tree, with about half of it in the\nhollow of the tree, and the other half upright in the air. Then we began\nto laugh at the Indians for fools, that they could not as well have\nfound their way down by the ladder, and have made their escape, as to\nhave pulled it up by main strength into the tree.\n\nWe then resolved upon fire, and so to put an end to the work at once,\nand burn the tree and its inhabitants together; and accordingly we\nwent to work to cut wood, and in a few hours' time we got enough, as we\nthought, together; and, piling it up round the bottom of the tree,\nwe set it on fire, waiting at a distance to see when, the gentlemen's\nquarters being too hot for them, they would come flying out at the top.\nBut we were quite confounded when, on a sudden, we found the fire all\nput out by a great quantity of water thrown upon it. We then thought the\ndevil must be in them, to be sure. Says William, \"This is certainly the\ncunningest piece of Indian engineering that ever was heard of; and there\ncan be but one thing more to guess at, besides witchcraft and dealing\nwith the devil, which I believe not one word of,\" says he; \"and that\nmust be, that this is an artificial tree, or a natural tree artificially\nmade hollow down into the earth, through root and all; and that these\ncreatures have an artificial cavity underneath it, quite into the hill,\nor a way to go through, and under the hill, to some other place; and\nwhere that other place is, we know not; but if it be not our own fault,\nI'll find the place, and follow them into it, before I am two days\nolder.\" He then called the carpenters, to know of them if they had any\nlarge saws that would cut through the body; and they told him they had\nno saws that were long enough, nor could men work into such a monstrous\nold stump in a great while; but that they would go to work with it with\ntheir axes, and undertake to cut it down in two days, and stock up the\nroot of it in two more. But William was for another way, which proved\nmuch better than all this; for he was for silent work, that, if\npossible, he might catch some of the fellows in it. So he sets twelve\nmen to it with large augers, to bore great holes into the side of the\ntree, to go almost through, but not quite through; which holes were\nbored without noise, and when they were done he filled them all with\ngunpowder, stopping strong plugs, bolted crossways, into the holes, and\nthen boring a slanting hole, of a less size, down into the greater hole,\nall of which were filled with powder, and at once blown up. When they\ntook fire, they made such a noise, and tore and split up the tree in\nso many places, and in such a manner, that we could see plainly such\nanother blast would demolish it; and so it did. Thus at the second time\nwe could, at two or three places, put our hands in them, and discovered\na cheat, namely, that there was a cave or hole dug into the earth, from\nor through the bottom of the hollow, and that it had communication with\nanother cave farther in, where we heard the voices of several of the\nwild folks, calling and talking to one another.\n\nWhen we came thus far we had a great mind to get at them; and William\ndesired that three men might be given him with hand-grenadoes; and he\npromised to go down first, and boldly he did so; for William, to give\nhim his due, had the heart of a lion.\n\nThey had pistols in their hands, and swords by their sides; but, as they\nhad taught the Indians before by their stink-pots, the Indians returned\nthem in their own kind; for they made such a smoke come up out of the\nentrance into the cave or hollow, that William and his three men were\nglad to come running out of the cave, and out of the tree too, for mere\nwant of breath; and indeed they were almost stifled.\n\nNever was a fortification so well defended, or assailants so many ways\ndefeated. We were now for giving it over, and particularly I called\nWilliam, and told him I could not but laugh to see us spinning out our\ntime here for nothing; that I could not imagine what we were doing; that\nit was certain that the rogues that were in it were cunning to the\nlast degree, and it would vex anybody to be so baulked by a few naked\nignorant fellows; but still it was not worth our while to push it any\nfurther, nor was there anything that I knew of to be got by the conquest\nwhen it was made, so that I thought it high time to give it over.\n\nWilliam acknowledged what I said was just, and that there was nothing\nbut our curiosity to be gratified in this attempt; and though, as he\nsaid, he was very desirous to have searched into the thing, yet he would\nnot insist upon it; so we resolved to quit it and come away, which\nwe did. However, William said before we went he would have this\nsatisfaction of them, viz., to burn down the tree and stop up the\nentrance into the cave. And while doing this the gunner told him he\nwould have one satisfaction of the rogues; and this was, that he would\nmake a mine of it, and see which way it had vent. Upon this he fetched\ntwo barrels of powder out of the ships, and placed them in the inside of\nthe hollow of the cave, as far in as he durst go to carry them, and then\nfilling up the mouth of the cave where the tree stood, and ramming it\nsufficiently hard, leaving only a pipe or touch-hole, he gave fire to\nit, and stood at a distance to see which way it would operate, when on\na sudden he found the force of the powder burst its way out among some\nbushes on the other side the little hill I mentioned, and that it came\nroaring out there as out of the mouth of a cannon. Immediately running\nthither, we saw the effects of the powder.\n\nFirst, we saw that there was the other mouth of the cave, which the\npowder had so torn and opened, that the loose earth was so fallen in\nagain that nothing of shape could be discerned; but there we saw what\nwas become of the garrison of the Indians, too, who had given us all\nthis trouble, for some of them had no arms, some no legs, some no head;\nsome lay half buried in the rubbish of the mine--that is to say, in the\nloose earth that fell in; and, in short, there was a miserable havoc\nmade in them all; for we had good reason to believe not one of them that\nwere in the inside could escape, but rather were shot out of the mouth\nof the cave, like a bullet out of a gun.\n\nWe had now our full satisfaction of the Indians; but, in short, this was\na losing voyage, for we had two men killed, one quite crippled, and five\nmore wounded; we spent two barrels of powder, and eleven days' time, and\nall to get the understanding how to make an Indian mine, or how to keep\ngarrison in a hollow tree; and with this wit, bought at this dear\nprice, we came away, having taken in some fresh water, but got no fresh\nprovisions.\n\nWe then considered what we should do to get back again to Madagascar.\nWe were much about the latitude of the Cape of Good Hope, but had such a\nvery long run, and were neither sure of meeting with fair winds nor with\nany land in the way, that we knew not what to think of it. William\nwas our last resort in this case again, and he was very plain with us.\n\"Friend,\" says he to Captain Wilmot, \"what occasion hast thou to run the\nventure of starving, merely for the pleasure of saying thou hast been\nwhere nobody has been before? There are a great many places nearer\nhome, of which thou mayest say the same thing at less expense. I see no\noccasion thou hast of keeping thus far south any longer than till you\nare sure you are to the west end of Java and Sumatra; and then thou\nmayest stand away north towards Ceylon, and the coast of Coromandel and\nMadras, where thou mayest get both fresh water and fresh provisions; and\nto that part it is likely we may hold out well enough with the stores we\nhave already.\"\n\nThis was wholesome advice, and such as was not to be slighted; so we\nstood away to the west, keeping between the latitude of 31 and 35, and\nhad very good weather and fair winds for about ten days' sail; by which\ntime, by our reckoning, we were clear of the isles, and might run away\nto the north; and if we did not fall in with Ceylon, we should at least\ngo into the great deep Bay of Bengal.\n\nBut we were out in our reckoning a great deal; for, when we had stood\ndue north for about fifteen or sixteen degrees, we met with land again\non our starboard bow, about three leagues' distance; so we came to an\nanchor about half a league from it, and manned out our boats to see what\nsort of a country it was. We found it a very good one; fresh water easy\nto come at, but no cattle that we could see, or inhabitants; and we\nwere very shy of searching too far after them, lest we should make such\nanother journey as we did last; so that we let rambling alone, and chose\nrather to take what we could find, which was only a few wild mangoes,\nand some plants of several kinds, which we knew not the names of.\n\nWe made no stay here, but put to sea again, N.W. by N., but had little\nwind for a fortnight more, when we made land again; and standing in with\nthe shore, we were surprised to find ourselves on the south shore of\nJava; and just as we were coming to an anchor we saw a boat, carrying\nDutch colours, sailing along-shore. We were not solicitous to speak\nwith them, or any other of their nation, but left it indifferent to our\npeople, when they went on shore, to see the Dutchmen or not to see them;\nour business was to get provisions, which, indeed, by this time were\nvery short with us.\n\nWe resolved to go on shore with our boats in the most convenient place\nwe could find, and to look out a proper harbour to bring the ship into,\nleaving it to our fate whether we should meet with friends or enemies;\nresolving, however, not to stay any considerable time, at least not\nlong enough to have expresses sent across the island to Batavia, and for\nships to come round from thence to attack us.\n\nWe found, according to our desire, a very good harbour, where we rode\nin seven fathom water, well defended from the weather, whatever might\nhappen; and here we got fresh provisions, such as good hogs and some\ncows; and that we might lay in a little store, we killed sixteen cows,\nand pickled and barrelled up the flesh as well as we could be supposed\nto do in the latitude of eight degrees from the line.\n\nWe did all this in about five days, and filled our casks with water; and\nthe last boat was coming off with herbs and roots, we being unmoored,\nand our fore-topsail loose for sailing, when we spied a large ship to\nthe northward, bearing down directly upon us. We knew not what she might\nbe, but concluded the worst, and made all possible haste to get our\nanchor up, and get under sail, that we might be in a readiness to see\nwhat she had to say to us, for we were under no great concern for one\nship, but our notion was, that we should be attacked by three or four\ntogether.\n\nBy the time we had got up our anchor and the boat was stowed, the ship\nwas within a league of us, and, as we thought, bore down to engage us;\nso we spread our black flag, or ancient, on the poop, and the bloody\nflag at the top-mast-head, and having made a clear ship, we stretched\naway to the westward, to get the wind of him.\n\nThey had, it seems, quite mistaken us before, expecting nothing of an\nenemy or a pirate in those seas; and, not doubting but we had been one\nof their own ships, they seemed to be in some confusion when they found\ntheir mistake, so they immediately hauled upon a wind on the other tack,\nand stood edging in for the shore, towards the easternmost part of the\nisland. Upon this we tacked, and stood after him with all the sail we\ncould, and in two hours came almost within gunshot. Though they crowded\nall the sail they could lay on, there was no remedy but to engage us,\nand they soon saw their inequality of force. We fired a gun for them to\nbring to; so they manned out their boat, and sent to us with a flag of\ntruce. We sent back the boat, but with this answer to the captain, that\nhe had nothing to do but to strike and bring his ship to an anchor\nunder our stern, and come on board us himself, when he should know our\ndemands; but that, however, since he had not yet put us to the trouble\nof forcing him, which we saw we were able to do, we assured them that\nthe captain should return again in safety, and all his men, and that,\nsupplying us with such things as we should demand, his ship should not\nbe plundered. They went back with this message, and it was some time\nafter they were on board before they struck, which made us begin to\nthink they refused it; so we fired a shot, and in a few minutes more we\nperceived their boat put off; and as soon as the boat put off the ship\nstruck and came to an anchor, as was directed.\n\nWhen the captain came on board, we demanded an account of their cargo,\nwhich was chiefly bales of goods from Bengal for Bantam. We told them\nour present want was provisions, which they had no need of, being just\nat the end of their voyage; and that, if they would send their boat on\nshore with ours, and procure us six-and-twenty head of black cattle,\nthreescore hogs, a quantity of brandy and arrack, and three hundred\nbushels of rice, we would let them go free.\n\nAs to the rice, they gave us six hundred bushels, which they had\nactually on board, together with a parcel shipped upon freight. Also,\nthey gave us thirty middling casks of very good arrack, but beef and\npork they had none. However, they went on shore with our men, and bought\neleven bullocks and fifty hogs, which were pickled up for our occasion;\nand upon the supplies of provision from shore, we dismissed them and\ntheir ship.\n\nWe lay here several days before we could furnish ourselves with the\nprovisions agreed for, and some of the men fancied the Dutchmen were\ncontriving our destruction; but they were very honest, and did what they\ncould to furnish the black cattle, but found it impossible to supply so\nmany. So they came and told us ingenuously, that, unless we could stay\na while longer, they could get no more oxen or cows than those eleven,\nwith which we were obliged to be satisfied, taking the value of them\nin other things, rather than stay longer there. On our side, we were\npunctual with them in observing the conditions we had agreed on; nor\nwould we let any of our men so much as go on board them, or suffer any\nof their men to come on board us; for, had any of our men gone on board,\nnobody could have answered for their behaviour, any more than if they\nhad been on shore in an enemy's country.\n\nWe were now victualled for our voyage; and, as we mattered not purchase,\nwe went merrily on for the coast of Ceylon, where we intended to touch,\nto get fresh water again, and more provisions; and we had nothing\nmaterial offered in this part of the voyage, only that we met with\ncontrary winds, and were above a month in the passage.\n\nWe put in upon the south coast of the island, desiring to have as little\nto do with the Dutch as we could; and as the Dutch were lords of the\ncountry as to commerce, so they are more so of the sea-coast, where they\nhave several forts, and, in particular, have all the cinnamon, which is\nthe trade of that island.\n\nWe took in fresh water here, and some provisions, but did not much\ntrouble ourselves about laying in any stores, our beef and hogs, which\nwe got at Java, being not yet all gone by a good deal. We had a little\nskirmish on shore here with some of the people of the island, some of\nour men having been a little too familiar with the homely ladies of the\ncountry; for homely, indeed, they were, to such a degree, that if our\nmen had not had good stomachs that way, they would scarce have touched\nany of them.\n\nI could never fully get it out of our men what they did, they were so\ntrue to one another in their wickedness, but I understood in the main,\nthat it was some barbarous thing they had done, and that they had like\nto have paid dear for it, for the men resented it to the last degree,\nand gathered in such numbers about them, that, had not sixteen more of\nour men, in another boat, come all in the nick of time, just to rescue\nour first men, who were but eleven, and so fetch them off by main force,\nthey had been all cut off, the inhabitants being no less than two or\nthree hundred, armed with darts and lances, the usual weapons of the\ncountry, and which they are very dexterous at the throwing, even so\ndexterous that it was scarce credible; and had our men stood to fight\nthem, as some of them were bold enough to talk of, they had been all\noverwhelmed and killed. As it was, seventeen of our men were wounded,\nand some of them very dangerously. But they were more frighted than hurt\ntoo, for every one of them gave themselves over for dead men, believing\nthe lances were poisoned. But William was our comfort here too; for,\nwhen two of our surgeons were of the same opinion, and told the men\nfoolishly enough that they would die, William cheerfully went to work\nwith them, and cured them all but one, who rather died by drinking some\narrack punch than of his wound; the excess of drinking throwing him into\na fever.\n\nWe had enough of Ceylon, though some of our people were for going\nashore again, sixty or seventy men together, to be revenged; but William\npersuaded them against it; and his reputation was so great among the\nmen, as well as with us that were commanders, that he could influence\nthem more than any of us.\n\nThey were mighty warm upon their revenge, and they would go on shore,\nand destroy five hundred of them. \"Well,\" says William, \"and suppose you\ndo, what are you the better?\" \"Why, then,\" says one of them, speaking\nfor the rest, \"we shall have our satisfaction.\" \"Well, and what will you\nbe the better for that?\" says William. They could then say nothing to\nthat. \"Then,\" says William, \"if I mistake not, your business is money;\nnow, I desire to know, if you conquer and kill two or three thousand of\nthese poor creatures, they have no money, pray what will you get? They\nare poor naked wretches; what shall you gain by them? But then,\" says\nWilliam, \"perhaps, in doing this, you may chance to lose half-a-score of\nyour own company, as it is very probable you may. Pray, what gain is\nin it? and what account can you give the captain for his lost men?\" In\nshort, William argued so effectually, that he convinced them that it\nwas mere murder to do so; and that the men had a right to their own,\nand that they had no right to take them away; that it was destroying\ninnocent men, who had acted no otherwise than as the laws of nature\ndictated; and that it would be as much murder to do so, as to meet a man\non the highway, and kill him, for the mere sake of it, in cold blood,\nnot regarding whether he had done any wrong to us or no.\n\nThese reasons prevailed with them at last, and they were content to\ngo away, and leave them as they found them. In the first skirmish they\nkilled between sixty and seventy men, and wounded a great many more; but\nthey had nothing, and our people got nothing by it, but the loss of one\nman's life, and the wounding sixteen more, as above.\n\nBut another accident brought us to a necessity of further business with\nthese people, and indeed we had like to have put an end to our lives\nand adventures all at once among them; for, about three days after our\nputting out to sea from the place where we had that skirmish, we\nwere attacked by a violent storm of wind from the south, or rather a\nhurricane of wind from all the points southward, for it blew in a most\ndesperate and furious manner from the S.E. to the S.W., one minute at\none point, and then instantly turning about again to another point,\nbut with the same violence; nor were we able to work the ship in that\ncondition, so that the ship I was in split three top-sails, and at last\nbrought the main-top-mast by the board; and, in a word, we were once or\ntwice driven right ashore; and one time, had not the wind shifted the\nvery moment it did, we had been dashed in a thousand pieces upon a great\nledge of rocks which lay off about half-a-league from the shore; but,\nas I have said, the wind shifting very often, and at that time coming\nto the E.S.E., we stretched off, and got above a league more sea-room in\nhalf-an-hour. After that, it blew with some fury S.W. by S., then S.W.\nby W., and put us back again a great way to the eastward of the ledge\nof rocks, where we found a great opening between the rocks and the land,\nand endeavoured to come to an anchor there, but we found there was no\nground fit to anchor in, and that we should lose our anchors, there\nbeing nothing but rocks. We stood through the opening, which held about\nfour leagues. The storm continued, and now we found a dreadful foul\nshore, and knew not what course to take. We looked out very narrowly\nfor some river or creek or bay, where we might run in, and come to an\nanchor, but found none a great while. At length we saw a great headland\nlie out far south into the sea, and that to such a length, that, in\nshort, we saw plainly that, if the wind held where it was, we could not\nweather it, so we ran in as much under the lee of the point as we could,\nand came to an anchor in about twelve fathom water.\n\nBut the wind veering again in the night, and blowing exceedingly hard,\nour anchors came home, and the ship drove till the rudder struck against\nthe ground; and had the ship gone half her length farther she had been\nlost, and every one of us with her. But our sheet-anchor held its own,\nand we heaved in some of the cable, to get clear of the ground we had\nstruck upon. It was by this only cable that we rode it out all night;\nand towards morning we thought the wind abated a little; and it was well\nfor us that it was so, for, in spite of what our sheet-anchor did for\nus, we found the ship fast aground in the morning, to our very great\nsurprise and amazement.\n\nWhen the tide was out, though the water here ebbed away, the ship lay\nalmost dry upon a bank of hard sand, which never, I suppose, had any\nship upon it before. The people of the country came down in great\nnumbers to look at us and gaze, not knowing what we were, but gaping at\nus as at a great sight or wonder at which they were surprised, and knew\nnot what to do.\n\nI have reason to believe that upon the sight they immediately sent an\naccount of a ship being there, and of the condition we were in, for the\nnext day there appeared a great man; whether it was their king or no\nI know not, but he had abundance of men with him, and some with long\njavelins in their hands as long as half-pikes; and these came all down\nto the water's edge, and drew up in a very good order, just in our view.\nThey stood near an hour without making any motion; and then there came\nnear twenty of them, with a man before them carrying a white flag. They\ncame forward into the water as high as their waists, the sea not going\nso high as before, for the wind was abated, and blew off the shore.\n\nThe man made a long oration to us, as we could see by his gestures; and\nwe sometimes heard his voice, but knew not one word he said. William,\nwho was always useful to us, I believe was here again the saving of all\nour lives. The case was this: The fellow, or what I might call him, when\nhis speech was done, gave three great screams (for I know not what else\nto say they were), then lowered his white flag three times, and then\nmade three motions to us with his arm to come to him.\n\nI acknowledge that I was for manning out the boat and going to them, but\nWilliam would by no means allow me. He told me we ought to trust nobody;\nthat, if they were barbarians, and under their own government, we might\nbe sure to be all murdered; and, if they were Christians, we should not\nfare much better, if they knew who we were; that it was the custom of\nthe Malabars to betray all people that they could get into their hands,\nand that these were some of the same people; and that, if we had any\nregard to our own safety, we should not go to them by any means. I\nopposed him a great while, and told him I thought he used to be always\nright, but that now I thought he was not; that I was no more for running\nneedless risks than he or any one else; but I thought all nations in the\nworld, even the most savage people, when they held out a flag of peace,\nkept the offer of peace made by that signal very sacredly; and I gave\nhim several examples of it in the history of my African travels, which\nI have here gone through in the beginning of this work, and that I could\nnot think these people worse than some of them. And, besides, I told him\nour case seemed to be such that we must fall into somebody's hands or\nother, and that we had better fall into their hands by a friendly treaty\nthan by a forced submission, nay, though they had indeed a treacherous\ndesign; and therefore I was for a parley with them.\n\n\"Well, friend,\" says William very gravely, \"if thou wilt go I cannot\nhelp it; I shall only desire to take my last leave of thee at parting,\nfor, depend upon it, thou wilt never see us again. Whether we in the\nship may come off any better at last I cannot resolve thee; but this I\nwill answer for, that we will not give up our lives idly, and in cool\nblood, as thou art going to do; we will at least preserve ourselves as\nlong as we can, and die at last like men, not like fools, trepanned by\nthe wiles of a few barbarians.\"\n\nWilliam spoke this with so much warmth, and yet with so much assurance\nof our fate, that I began to think a little of the risk I was going to\nrun. I had no more mind to be murdered than he; and yet I could not for\nmy life be so faint-hearted in the thing as he. Upon which I asked him\nif he had any knowledge of the place, or had ever been there. He said,\nNo. Then I asked him if he had heard or read anything about the people\nof this island, and of their way of treating any Christians that had\nfallen into their hands; and he told me he had heard of one, and\nhe would tell me the story afterward. His name, he said, was Knox,\ncommander of an East India ship, who was driven on shore, just as we\nwere, upon this island of Ceylon, though he could not say it was at the\nsame place, or whereabouts; that he was beguiled by the barbarians, and\nenticed to come on shore, just as we were invited to do at that time;\nand that, when they had him, they surrounded him, and eighteen or twenty\nof his men, and never suffered them to return, but kept them prisoners,\nor murdered them, he could not tell which; but they were carried away\nup into the country, separated from one another, and never heard of\nafterwards, except the captain's son, who miraculously made his escape,\nafter twenty years' slavery.\n\nI had no time then to ask him to give the full story of this Knox, much\nless to hear him tell it me; but, as it is usual in such cases, when\none begins to be a little touched, I turned short with him. \"Why then,\nfriend William,\" said I, \"what would you have us do? You see what\ncondition we are in, and what is before us; something must be done, and\nthat immediately.\" \"Why,\" says William, \"I'll tell thee what thou shalt\ndo; first, cause a white flag to be hanged out, as they do to us, and\nman out the longboat and pinnace with as many men as they can well stow,\nto handle their arms, and let me go with them, and thou shalt see what\nwe will do. If I miscarry, thou mayest be safe; and I will also tell\nthee, that if I do miscarry, it shall be my own fault, and thou shalt\nlearn wit by my folly.\"\n\nI knew not what to reply to him at first; but, after some pause, I said,\n\"William, William, I am as loath you should be lost as you are that I\nshould; and if there be any danger, I desire you may no more fall into\nit than I. Therefore, if you will, let us all keep in the ship, fare\nalike, and take our fate together.\"\n\n\"No, no,\" says William, \"there's no danger in the method I propose; thou\nshalt go with me, if thou thinkest fit. If thou pleasest but to follow\nthe measures that I shall resolve on, depend upon it, though we will\ngo off from the ships, we will not a man of us go any nearer them than\nwithin call to talk with them. Thou seest they have no boats to come off\nto us; but,\" says he, \"I rather desire thou wouldst take my advice, and\nmanage the ships as I shall give the signal from the boat, and let us\nconcert that matter together before we go off.\"\n\nWell, I found William had his measures in his head all laid beforehand,\nand was not at a loss what to do at all; so I told him he should be\ncaptain for this voyage, and we would be all of us under his orders,\nwhich I would see observed to a tittle.\n\nUpon this conclusion of our debates, he ordered four-and-twenty men into\nthe long-boat, and twelve men into the pinnace, and the sea being now\npretty smooth, they went off, being all very well armed. Also he ordered\nthat all the guns of the great ship, on the side which lay next the\nshore, should be loaded with musket-balls, old nails, stubs, and\nsuch-like pieces of old iron, lead, and anything that came to hand; and\nthat we should prepare to fire as soon as ever we saw them lower the\nwhite flag and hoist up a red one in the pinnace.\n\nWith these measures fixed between us, they went off towards the shore,\nWilliam in the pinnace with twelve men, and the long-boat coming after\nhim with four-and-twenty more, all stout resolute fellows, and very\nwell armed. They rowed so near the shore as that they might speak to one\nanother, carrying a white flag, as the other did, and offering a parley.\nThe brutes, for such they were, showed themselves very courteous; but\nfinding we could not understand them, they fetched an old Dutchman, who\nhad been their prisoner many years, and set him to speak to us. The sum\nand substance of his speech was, that the king of the country had sent\nhis general down to know who we were, and what our business was. William\nstood up in the stern of the pinnace, and told him, that as to that, he,\nthat was an European, by his language and voice, might easily know what\nwe were, and our condition; the ship being aground upon the sand would\nalso tell him that our business there was that of a ship in distress; so\nWilliam desired to know what they came down for with such a multitude,\nand with arms and weapons, as if they came to war with us.\n\nHe answered, they might have good reason to come down to the shore, the\ncountry being alarmed with the appearance of ships of strangers upon\nthe coast; and as our vessels were full of men, and as we had guns and\nweapons, the king had sent part of his military men, that, in case of\nany invasion upon the country, they might be ready to defend themselves,\nwhatsoever might be the occasion.\n\n\"But,\" says he, \"as you are men in distress, the king has ordered his\ngeneral, who is here also, to give you all the assistance he can, and to\ninvite you on shore, and receive you with all possible courtesy.\" Says\nWilliam, very quick upon him, \"Before I give thee an answer to that,\nI desire thee to tell me what thou art, for by thy speech thou art an\nEuropean.\" He answered presently, he was a Dutchman. \"That I know well,\"\nsays William, \"by thy speech; but art thou a native Dutchman of Holland,\nor a native of this country, that has learned Dutch by conversing among\nthe Hollanders, who we know are settled upon this island?\"\n\n\"No,\" says the old man, \"I am a native of Delft, in the province of\nHolland, in Europe.\"\n\n\"Well,\" says William, immediately, \"but art thou a Christian or a\nheathen, or what we call a renegado?\"\n\n\"I am,\" says he, \"a Christian.\" And so they went on, in a short\ndialogue, as follows:--\n\n_William_. Thou art a Dutchman, and a Christian, thou sayest; pray, art\nthou a freeman or a servant?\n\n_Dutchman_. I am a servant to the king here, and in his army.\n\n_W_. But art thou a volunteer, or a prisoner?\n\n_D_. Indeed I was a prisoner at first, but am at liberty now, and so am\na volunteer.\n\n_W_. That is to say, being first a prisoner, thou hast liberty to serve\nthem; but art thou so at liberty that thou mayest go away, if thou\npleasest, to thine own countrymen?\n\n_D_. No, I do not say so; my countrymen live a great way off, on the\nnorth and east parts of the island, and there is no going to them\nwithout the king's express license.\n\n_W_. Well, and why dost thou not get a license to go away?\n\n_D_. I have never asked for it.\n\n_W_. And, I suppose, if thou didst, thou knowest thou couldst not obtain\nit.\n\n_D_. I cannot say much as to that; but why do you ask me all these\nquestions?\n\n_W_. Why, my reason is good; if thou art a Christian and a prisoner,\nhow canst thou consent to be made an instrument to these barbarians,\nto betray us into their hands, who are thy countrymen and\nfellow-Christians? Is it not a barbarous thing in thee to do so?\n\n_D_. How do I go about to betray you? Do I not give you an account how\nthe king invites you to come on shore, and has ordered you to be treated\ncourteously and assisted?\n\n_W_. As thou art a Christian, though I doubt it much, dost thou believe\nthe king or the general, as thou callest it, means one word of what he\nsays?\n\n_D_. He promises you by the mouth of his great general.\n\n_W_. I don't ask thee what he promises, or by whom; but I ask thee this:\nCanst thou say that thou believest he intends to perform it?\n\n_D_. How can I answer that? How can I tell what he intends?\n\n_W_. Thou canst tell what thou believest.\n\n_D_. I cannot say but he will perform it; I believe he may.\n\n_W_. Thou art but a double-tongued Christian, I doubt. Come, I'll ask\nthee another question: Wilt thou say that thou believest it, and that\nthou wouldst advise me to believe it, and put our lives into their hands\nupon these promises?\n\n_D_. I am not to be your adviser.\n\n_W_. Thou art perhaps afraid to speak thy mind, because thou art in\ntheir power. Pray, do any of them understand what thou and I say? Can\nthey speak Dutch?\n\n_D_. No, not one of them; I have no apprehensions upon that account at\nall.\n\n_W_. Why, then, answer me plainly, if thou art a Christian: Is it safe\nfor us to venture upon their words, to put ourselves into their hands,\nand come on shore?\n\n_D_. You put it very home to me. Pray let me ask you another question:\nAre you in any likelihood of getting your ship off, if you refuse it?\n\n_W_. Yes, yes, we shall get off the ship; now the storm is over we don't\nfear it.\n\n_D_. Then I cannot say it is best for you to trust them.\n\n_W_. Well, it is honestly said.\n\n_D_. But what shall I say to them?\n\n_W_. Give them good words, as they give us.\n\n_D_. What good words?\n\n_W_. Why, let them tell the king that we are strangers, who were driven\non his coast by a great storm; that we thank him very kindly for his\noffer of civility to us, which, if we are further distressed, we will\naccept thankfully; but that at present we have no occasion to come on\nshore; and besides, that we cannot safely leave the ship in the present\ncondition she is in; but that we are obliged to take care of her, in\norder to get her off; and expect, in a tide or two more, to get her\nquite clear, and at an anchor.\n\n_D_. But he will expect you to come on shore, then, to visit him, and\nmake him some present for his civility.\n\n_W_. When we have got our ship clear, and stopped the leaks, we will pay\nour respects to him.\n\n_D_. Nay, you may as well come to him now as then.\n\n_W_. Nay, hold, friend; I did not say we would come to him then: you\ntalked of making him a present, that is to pay our respects to him, is\nit not?\n\n_D_. Well, but I will tell him that you will come on shore to him when\nyour ship is got off.\n\n_W_. I have nothing to say to that; you may tell him what you think fit.\n\n_D_. But he will be in a great rage if I do not.\n\n_W_. Who will he be in a great rage at?\n\n_D_. At you.\n\n_W_. What occasion have we to value that?\n\n_D_. Why, he will send all his army down against you.\n\n_W_. And what if they were all here just now? What dost thou suppose\nthey could do to us?\n\n_D_. He would expect they should burn your ships and bring you all to\nhim.\n\n_W_. Tell him, if he should try, he may catch a Tartar.\n\n_D_. He has a world of men.\n\n_W_. Has he any ships?\n\n_D_. No, he has no ships.\n\n_W_. Nor boats?\n\n_D_. No, nor boats.\n\n_W_. Why, what then do you think we care for his men? What canst thou do\nnow to us, if thou hadst a hundred thousand with thee?\n\n_D_. Oh! they might set you on fire.\n\n_W_. Set us a-firing, thou meanest; that they might indeed; but set us\non fire they shall not; they may try, at their peril, and we shall make\nmad work with your hundred thousand men, if they come within reach of\nour guns, I assure thee.\n\n_D_. But what if the king gives you hostages for your safety?\n\n_W_. Whom can he give but mere slaves and servants like thyself, whose\nlives he no more values than we an English hound?\n\n_D_. Whom do you demand for hostages?\n\n_W_. Himself and your worship.\n\n_D_. What would you do with him?\n\n_W_. Do with him as he would do with us--cut his head off.\n\n_D_. And what would you do with me?\n\n_W_. Do with thee? We would carry thee home into thine own country; and,\nthough thou deservest the gallows, we would make a man and a Christian\nof thee again, and not do by thee as thou wouldst have done by\nus--betray thee to a parcel of merciless, savage pagans, that know no\nGod, nor how to show mercy to man.\n\n_D_. You put a thought in my head that I will speak to you about\nto-morrow.\n\nThus they went away, and William came on board, and gave us a full\naccount of his parley with the old Dutchman, which was very diverting,\nand to me instructing; for I had abundance of reason to acknowledge\nWilliam had made a better judgment of things than I.\n\nIt was our good fortune to get our ship off that very night, and to\nbring her to an anchor at about a mile and a half farther out, and in\ndeep water, to our great satisfaction; so that we had no need to fear\nthe Dutchman's king, with his hundred thousand men; and indeed we\nhad some sport with them the next day, when they came down, a\nvast prodigious multitude of them, very few less in number, in our\nimagination, than a hundred thousand, with some elephants; though, if it\nhad been an army of elephants, they could have done us no harm; for we\nwere fairly at our anchor now, and out of their reach. And indeed we\nthought ourselves more out of their reach than we really were; and it\nwas ten thousand to one that we had not been fast aground again, for the\nwind blowing off shore, though it made the water smooth where we lay,\nyet it blew the ebb farther out than usual, and we could easily perceive\nthe sand, which we touched upon before, lay in the shape of a half-moon,\nand surrounded us with two horns of it, so that we lay in the middle\nor centre of it, as in a round bay, safe just as we were, and in deep\nwater, but present death, as it were, on the right hand and on the left,\nfor the two horns or points of the sand reached out beyond where our\nship lay near two miles.\n\nOn that part of the sand which lay on our east side, this misguided\nmultitude extended themselves; and being, most of them, not above their\nknees, or most of them not above ankle-deep in the water, they as it\nwere surrounded us on that side, and on the side of the mainland, and a\nlittle way on the other side of the sand, standing in a half-circle,\nor rather three-fifths of a circle, for about six miles in length. The\nother horn, or point of the sand, which lay on our west side, being not\nquite so shallow, they could not extend themselves upon it so far.\n\nThey little thought what service they had done us, and how unwittingly,\nand by the greatest ignorance, they had made themselves pilots to us,\nwhile we, having not sounded the place, might have been lost before we\nwere aware. It is true we might have sounded our new harbour before we\nhad ventured out, but I cannot say for certain whether we should or not;\nfor I, for my part, had not the least suspicion of what our real case\nwas; however, I say, perhaps, before we had weighed, we should have\nlooked about us a little. I am sure we ought to have done it; for,\nbesides these armies of human furies, we had a very leaky ship, and\nall our pumps could hardly keep the water from growing upon us, and our\ncarpenters were overboard, working to find out and stop the wounds we\nhad received, heeling her first on the one side, and then on the other;\nand it was very diverting to see how, when our men heeled the ship over\nto the side next the wild army that stood on the east horn of the sand,\nthey were so amazed, between fright and joy, that it put them into a\nkind of confusion, calling to one another, hallooing and skreeking, in a\nmanner that it is impossible to describe.\n\nWhile we were doing this, for we were in a great hurry you may be sure,\nand all hands at work, as well at the stopping our leaks as repairing\nour rigging and sails, which had received a great deal of damage, and\nalso in rigging a new main-top-mast and the like;--I say, while we were\ndoing all this, we perceived a body of men, of near a thousand, move\nfrom that part of the army of the barbarians that lay at the bottom of\nthe sandy bay, and came all along the water's edge, round the sand, till\nthey stood just on our broadside east, and were within about half-a-mile\nof us. Then we saw the Dutchman come forward nearer to us, and all\nalone, with his white flag and all his motions, just as before, and\nthere he stood.\n\nOur men had but just brought the ship to rights again as they came up to\nour broadside, and we had very happily found out and stopped the worst\nand most dangerous leak that we had, to our very great satisfaction;\nso I ordered the boats to be hauled up and manned as they were the day\nbefore, and William to go as plenipotentiary. I would have gone myself\nif I had understood Dutch, but as I did not, it was to no purpose, for\nI should be able to know nothing of what was said but from him\nat second-hand, which might be done as well afterwards. All the\ninstructions I pretended to give William was, if possible, to get the\nold Dutchman away, and, if he could, to make him come on board.\n\nWell, William went just as before, and when he came within about sixty\nor seventy yards of the shore, he held up his white flag as the Dutchman\ndid, and turning the boat's broadside to the shore, and his men lying\nupon their oars, the parley or dialogue began again thus:--\n\n_William_. Well, friend, what dost thou say to us now?\n\n_Dutchman_. I come of the same mild errand as I did yesterday.\n\n_W_. What! dost thou pretend to come of a mild errand with all these\npeople at thy back, and all the foolish weapons of war they bring with\nthem? Prithee, what dost thou mean?\n\n_D_. The king hastens us to invite the captain and all his men to come\non shore, and has ordered all his men to show them all the civility they\ncan.\n\n_W_. Well, and are all those men come to invite us ashore?\n\nD. They will do you no hurt, if you will come on shore peaceably.\n\nW. Well, and what dost thou think they can do to us, if we will not?\n\nD. I would not have them do you any hurt then, neither.\n\nW. But prithee, friend, do not make thyself fool and knave too. Dost not\nthou know that we are out of fear of all thy army, and out of danger\nof all that they can do? What makes thee act so simply as well as so\nknavishly?\n\nD. Why, you may think yourselves safer than you are; you do not know\nwhat they may do to you. I can assure you they are able to do you a\ngreat deal of harm, and perhaps burn your ship.\n\nW. Suppose that were true, as I am sure it is false; you see we have\nmore ships to carry us off (pointing to the sloop).\n\n[N.B.--Just at this time we discovered the sloop standing towards us\nfrom the east, along the shore, at about the distance of two leagues,\nwhich was to our particular satisfaction, she having been missing\nthirteen days.]\n\nD. We do not value that; if you had ten ships, you dare not come on\nshore, with all the men you have, in a hostile way; we are too many for\nyou.\n\nW. Thou dost not, even in that, speak as thou meanest; and we may give\nthee a trial of our hands when our friends come up to us, for thou\nhearest they have discovered us.\n\n[Just then the sloop fired five guns, which was to get news of us, for\nthey did not see us.]\n\nD. Yes, I hear they fire; but I hope your ship will not fire again; for,\nif they do, our general will take it for breaking the truce, and will\nmake the army let fly a shower of arrows at you in the boat.\n\nW. Thou mayest be sure the ship will fire that the other ship may hear\nthem, but not with ball. If thy general knows no better, he may begin\nwhen he will; but thou mayest be sure we will return it to his cost.\n\nD. What must I do, then?\n\nW. Do! Why, go to him, and tell him of it beforehand, then; and let\nhim know that the ship firing is not at him nor his men; and then come\nagain, and tell us what he says.\n\nD. No; I will send to him, which will do as well.\n\nW. Do as thou wilt, but I believe thou hadst better go thyself; for if\nour men fire first, I suppose he will be in a great wrath, and it may be\nat thee; for, as to his wrath at us, we tell thee beforehand we value it\nnot.\n\nD. You slight them too much; you know not what they may do.\n\nW. Thou makest as if these poor savage wretches could do mighty things:\nprithee, let us see what you can all do, we value it not; thou mayest\nset down thy flag of truce when thou pleasest, and begin.\n\nD. I had rather make a truce, and have you all part friends.\n\nW. Thou art a deceitful rogue thyself, for it is plain thou knowest\nthese people would only persuade us on shore to entrap and surprise us;\nand yet thou that art a Christian, as thou callest thyself, would have\nus come on shore and put our lives into their hands who know nothing\nthat belongs to compassion, good usage, or good manners. How canst thou\nbe such a villain?\n\nD. How can you call me so? What have I done to you, and what would you\nhave me do?\n\nW. Not act like a traitor, but like one that was once a Christian, and\nwould have been so still, if you had not been a Dutchman.\n\nD. I know not what to do, not I. I wish I were from them; they are a\nbloody people.\n\nW. Prithee, make no difficulty of what thou shouldst do. Canst thou\nswim?\n\nD. Yes, I can swim; but if I should attempt to swim off to you, I should\nhave a thousand arrows and javelins sticking in me before I should get\nto your boat.\n\nW. I'll bring the boat close to thee, and take thee on board in spite\nof them all. We will give them but one volley, and I'll engage they will\nall run away from thee.\n\nD. You are mistaken in them, I assure you; they would immediately come\nall running down to the shore, and shoot fire-arrows at you, and set\nyour boat and ship and all on fire about your ears.\n\nW. We will venture that if thou wilt come off.\n\nD. Will you use me honourably when I am among you?\n\nW. I'll give thee my word for it, if thou provest honest.\n\nD. Will you not make me a prisoner?\n\nW. I will be thy surety, body for body, that thou shalt be a free man,\nand go whither thou wilt, though I own to thee thou dost not deserve it.\n\nJust at this time our ship fired three guns to answer the sloop and let\nher know we saw her, who immediately, we perceived, understood it,\nand stood directly for the place. But it is impossible to express the\nconfusion and filthy vile noise, the hurry and universal disorder, that\nwas among that vast multitude of people upon our firing off three guns.\nThey immediately all repaired to their arms, as I may call it; for to\nsay they put themselves into order would be saying nothing.\n\nUpon the word of command, then, they advanced all in a body to the\nseaside, and resolving to give us one volley of their fire-arms (for\nsuch they were), immediately they saluted us with a hundred thousand of\ntheir fire-arrows, every one carrying a little bag of cloth dipped\nin brimstone, or some such thing, which, flying through the air, had\nnothing to hinder it taking fire as it flew, and it generally did so.\n\nI cannot say but this method of attacking us, by a way we had no notion\nof, might give us at first some little surprise, for the number was so\ngreat at first, that we were not altogether without apprehensions that\nthey might unluckily set our ship on fire, so that William resolved\nimmediately to row on board, and persuade us all to weigh and stand out\nto sea; but there was no time for it, for they immediately let fly a\nvolley at the boat, and at the ship, from all parts of the vast crowd of\npeople which stood near the shore. Nor did they fire, as I may call it,\nall at once, and so leave off; but their arrows being soon notched upon\ntheir bows, they kept continually shooting, so that the air was full of\nflame.\n\nI could not say whether they set their cotton rag on fire before they\nshot the arrow, for I did not perceive they had fire with them, which,\nhowever, it seems they had. The arrow, besides the fire it carried with\nit, had a head, or a peg, as we call it, of bone; and some of sharp\nflint stone; and some few of a metal, too soft in itself for metal, but\nhard enough to cause it to enter, if it were a plank, so as to stick\nwhere it fell.\n\nWilliam and his men had notice sufficient to lie close behind their\nwaste-boards, which, for this very purpose, they had made so high\nthat they could easily sink themselves behind them, so as to defend\nthemselves from anything that came point-blank (as we call it) or upon a\nline; but for what might fall perpendicularly out of the air they had no\nguard, but took the hazard of that. At first they made as if they would\nrow away, but before they went they gave a volley of their fire-arms,\nfiring at those which stood with the Dutchman; but William ordered them\nto be sure to take their aim at others, so as to miss him, and they did\nso.\n\nThere was no calling to them now, for the noise was so great among them\nthat they could hear nobody, but our men boldly rowed in nearer to them,\nfor they were at first driven a little off, and when they came nearer,\nthey fired a second volley, which put the fellows into great confusion,\nand we could see from the ship that several of them were killed or\nwounded.\n\nWe thought this was a very unequal fight, and therefore we made a signal\nto our men to row away, that we might have a little of the sport as\nwell as they; but the arrows flew so thick upon them, being so near the\nshore, that they could not sit to their oars, so they spread a little\nof their sail, thinking they might sail along the shore, and lie behind\ntheir waste-board; but the sail had not been spread six minutes till it\nhad five hundred fire-arrows shot into it and through it, and at length\nset it fairly on fire; nor were our men quite out of the danger of its\nsetting the boat on fire, and this made them paddle and shove the boat\naway as well as they could, as they lay, to get farther off.\n\nBy this time they had left us a fair mark at the whole savage army; and\nas we had sheered the ship as near to them as we could, we fired among\nthe thickest of them six or seven times, five guns at a time, with shot,\nold iron, musket-bullets, &c.\n\nWe could easily see that we made havoc among them, and killed and\nwounded abundance of them, and that they were in a great surprise at it;\nbut yet they never offered to stir, and all this while their fire-arrows\nflew as thick as before.\n\nAt last, on a sudden their arrows stopped, and the old Dutchman came\nrunning down to the water-side all alone, with his white flag, as\nbefore, waving it as high as he could, and making signals to our boat to\ncome to him again.\n\nWilliam did not care at first to go near him, but the man continuing to\nmake signals to him to come, at last William went; and the Dutchman told\nhim that he had been with the general, who was much mollified by the\nslaughter of his men, and that now he could have anything of him.\n\n\"Anything!\" says William; \"what have we to do with him? Let him go about\nhis business, and carry his men out of gunshot, can't he?\"\n\n\"Why,\" says the Dutchman, \"but he dares not stir, nor see the king's\nface; unless some of your men come on shore, he will certainly put him\nto death.\"\n\n\"Why, then,\" says William, \"he is a dead man; for if it were to save his\nlife, and the lives of all the crowd that is with him, he shall never\nhave one of us in his power. But I'll tell thee,\" said William, \"how\nthou shalt cheat him, and gain thy own liberty too, if thou hast any\nmind to see thy own country again, and art not turned savage, and grown\nfond of living all thy days among heathens and savages.\"\n\n\"I would be glad to do it with all my heart,\" says he; \"but if I should\noffer to swim off to you now, though they are so far from me, they shoot\nso true that they would kill me before I got half-way.\"\n\n\"But,\" says William, \"I'll tell thee how thou shalt come with his\nconsent. Go to him, and tell him I have offered to carry you on board,\nto try if you could persuade the captain to come on shore, and that I\nwould not hinder him if he was willing to venture.\"\n\nThe Dutchman seemed in a rapture at the very first word. \"I'll do it,\"\nsays he; \"I am persuaded he will give me leave to come.\"\n\nAway he runs, as if he had a glad message to carry, and tells the\ngeneral that William had promised, if he would go on board the ship with\nhim, he would persuade the captain to return with him. The general was\nfool enough to give him orders to go, and charged him not to come back\nwithout the captain; which he readily promised, and very honestly might.\n\nSo they took him in, and brought him on board, and he was as good as\nhis word to them, for he never went back to them any more; and the sloop\nbeing come to the mouth of the inlet where we lay, we weighed and set\nsail; but, as we went out, being pretty near the shore, we fired three\nguns, as it were among them, but without any shot, for it was of no\nuse to us to hurt any more of them. After we had fired, we gave them a\ncheer, as the seamen call it; that is to say, we hallooed, at them, by\nway of triumph, and so carried off their ambassador. How it fared with\ntheir general, we know nothing of that.\n\nThis passage, when I related it to a friend of mine, after my return\nfrom those rambles, agreed so well with his relation of what happened to\none Mr Knox, an English captain, who some time ago was decoyed on shore\nby these people, that it could not but be very much to my satisfaction\nto think what mischief we had all escaped; and I think it cannot but be\nvery profitable to record the other story (which is but short) with my\nown, to show whoever reads this what it was I avoided, and prevent their\nfalling into the like, if they have to do with the perfidious people of\nCeylon. The relation is as follows:--\n\nThe island of Ceylon being inhabited for the greatest part by\nbarbarians, which will not allow any trade or commerce with any European\nnation, and inaccessible by any travellers, it will be convenient to\nrelate the occasion how the author of this story happened to go into\nthis island, and what opportunities he had of being fully acquainted\nwith the people, their laws and customs, that so we may the better\ndepend upon the account, and value it as it deserves, for the rarity\nas well as the truth of it; and both these the author gives us a brief\nrelation of in this manner. His words are as follows:\n\nIn the year 1657, the _Anne_ frigate, of London, Captain Robert Knox,\ncommander, on the 21st day of January, set sail out of the Downs, in the\nservice of the honourable East India Company of England, bound for Fort\nSt George, upon the coast of Coromandel, to trade for one year from port\nto port in India; which having performed, as he was lading his goods\nto return for England, being in the road of Masulipatam, on the 19th of\nNovember 1659, there happened such a mighty storm, that in it several\nships were cast away, and he was forced to cut his mainmast by the\nboard, which so disabled the ship, that he could not proceed in his\nvoyage; whereupon Cottiar, in the island of Ceylon, being a very\ncommodious bay, fit for her present distress, Thomas Chambers, Esq.,\nsince Sir Thomas Chambers, the agent at Fort St George, ordered that the\nship should take in some cloth and India merchants belonging to Porto\nNovo, who might trade there while she lay to set her mast, and repair\nthe other damages sustained by the storm. At her first coming thither,\nafter the Indian merchants were set ashore, the captain and his men were\nvery jealous of the people of that place, by reason the English never\nhad any commerce or dealing with them; but after they had been there\ntwenty days, going ashore and returning again at pleasure, without any\nmolestation, they began to lay aside all suspicious thoughts of the\npeople that dwelt thereabouts, who had kindly entertained them for their\nmoney.\n\nBy this time the king of the country had notice of their arrival, and,\nnot being acquainted with their intents, he sent down a dissauva, or\ngeneral, with an army, to them, who immediately sent a messenger to\nthe captain on board, to desire him to come ashore to him, pretending\na letter from the king. The captain saluted the message with firing of\nguns, and ordered his son, Robert Knox, and Mr John Loveland, merchant\nof the ship, to go ashore, and wait on him. When they were come before\nhim, he demanded who they were, and how long they should stay. They told\nhim they were Englishmen, and not to stay above twenty or thirty days,\nand desired permission to trade in his Majesty's port. His answer was,\nthat the king was glad to hear the English were come into his country,\nand had commanded him to assist them as they should desire, and had sent\na letter to be delivered to none but the captain himself. They were then\ntwelve miles from the seaside, and therefore replied, that the captain\ncould not leave his ship to come so far; but if he pleased to go down\nto the seaside, the captain would wait on him to receive the letter;\nwhereupon the dissauva desired them to stay that day, and on the morrow\nhe would go with them; which, rather than displease him in so small a\nmatter, they consented to. In the evening the dissauva sent a present to\nthe captain of cattle and fruits, &c., which, being carried all night by\nthe messengers, was delivered to him in the morning, who told him withal\nthat his men were coming down with the dissauva, and desired his company\non shore against his coming, having a letter from the king to deliver\ninto his own hand. The captain, mistrusting nothing, came on shore with\nhis boat, and, sitting under a tamarind tree, waited for the dissauva.\nIn the meantime the native soldiers privately surrounded him and the\nseven men he had with him, and seizing them, carried them to meet the\ndissauva, bearing the captain on a hammock on their shoulders.\n\nThe next day the long-boat's crew, not knowing what had happened, came\non shore to cut down a tree to make cheeks for the mainmast, and were\nmade prisoners after the same manner, though with more violence, because\nthey were more rough with them, and made resistance; yet they were not\nbrought to the captain and his company, but quartered in another house\nin the same town.\n\nThe dissauva having thus gotten two boats and eighteen men, his next\ncare was to gain the ship; and to that end, telling the captain that he\nand his men were only detained because the king intended to send letters\nand a present to the English nation by him, desired he would send some\nmen on board his ship to order her to stay; and because the ship was\nin danger of being fired by the Dutch if she stayed long in the bay, to\nbring her up the river. The captain did not approve of the advice, but\ndid not dare to own his dislike; so he sent his son with the order, but\nwith a solemn conjuration to return again, which he accordingly did,\nbringing a letter from the company in the ship, that they would not obey\nthe captain, nor any other, in this matter, but were resolved to stand\non their own defence. This letter satisfied the dissauva, who thereupon\ngave the captain leave to write for what he would have brought from\nthe ship, pretending that he had not the king's order to release them,\nthough it would suddenly come.\n\nThe captain seeing he was held in suspense, and the season of the year\nspending for the ship to proceed on her voyage to some place, sent order\nto Mr John Burford, the chief mate, to take charge of the ship, and\nset sail to Porto Novo, from whence they came, and there to follow the\nagent's order.\n\nAnd now began that long and sad captivity they all along feared. The\nship being gone, the dissauva was called up to the king, and they were\nkept under guards a while, till a special order came from the king\nto part them, and put one in a town, for the conveniency of their\nmaintenance, which the king ordered to be at the charge of the country.\nOn September 16, 1660, the captain and his son were placed in a town\ncalled Bonder Coswat, in the country of Hotcurly [? Hewarrisse Korle],\ndistant from the city of Kandy northward thirty miles, and from the\nrest of the English a full day's journey. Here they had their provisions\nbrought them twice a day, without money, as much as they could eat,\nand as good as the country yielded. The situation of the place was very\npleasant and commodious; but that year that part of the land was very\nsickly by agues and fevers, of which many died. The captain and his son\nafter some time were visited with the common distemper, and the captain,\nbeing also loaded with grief for his deplorable condition, languished\nmore than three months, and then died, February 9, 1661.\n\nRobert Knox, his son, was now left desolate, sick, and in captivity,\nhaving none to comfort him but God, who is the Father of the fatherless,\nand hears the groans of such as are in captivity; being alone to enter\nupon a long scene of misery and calamity; oppressed with weakness of\nbody and grief of soul for the loss of his father, and the remediless\ntrouble that he was like to endure; and the first instance of it was in\nthe burial of his father, for he sent his black boy to the people of\nthe town, to desire their assistance, because they understood not their\nlanguage; but they sent him only a rope, to drag him by the neck into\nthe woods, and told him that they would offer him no other help, unless\nhe would pay for it. This barbarous answer increased his trouble for his\nfather's death, that now he was like to lie unburied, and be made a prey\nto the wild beasts in the woods; for the ground was very hard, and they\nhad not tools to dig with, and so it was impossible for them to bury\nhim; and having a small matter of money left him, viz., a pagoda and a\ngold ring, he hired a man, and so buried him in as decent a manner as\ntheir condition would permit.\n\nHis dead father being thus removed out of his sight, but his ague\ncontinuing, he was reduced very low, partly by sorrow and partly by his\ndisease. All the comfort he had was to go into the wood and fields with\na book, either the \"Practice of Piety\" or Mr Rogers's \"Seven Treatises,\"\nwhich were the only two books he had, and meditate and read, and\nsometimes pray; in which his anguish made him often invert Elijah's\npetition,--that he might die, because his life was a burden to him. God,\nthough He was pleased to prolong his life, yet He found a way to lighten\nhis grief, by removing his ague, and granting him a desire which above\nall things was acceptable to him. He had read his two books over so\noften that he had both almost by heart; and though they were both\npious and good writings, yet he longed for the truth from the original\nfountain, and thought it his greatest unhappiness that he had not a\nBible, and did believe that he should never see one again; but, contrary\nto his expectation, God brought him one after this manner. As he was\nfishing one day with his black boy, to catch some fish to relieve his\nhunger, an old man passed by them, and asked his boy whether his master\ncould read; and when the boy had answered yes, he told him that he had\ngotten a book from the Portuguese, when they left Colombo; and, if his\nmaster pleased, he would sell it him. The boy told his master, who bade\nhim go and see what book it was. The boy having served the English\nsome time, knew the book, and as soon as he got it into his hand, came\nrunning to him, calling out before he came to him, \"It is the Bible!\"\nThe words startled him, and he flung down his angle to meet him, and,\nfinding it was true, was mightily rejoiced to see it; but he was afraid\nhe should not have enough to purchase it, though he was resolved to part\nwith all the money he had, which was but one pagoda, to buy it; but his\nblack boy persuading him to slight it, and leave it to him to buy it, he\nat length obtained it for a knit cap.\n\nThis accident he could not but look upon as a great miracle, that God\nshould bestow upon him such an extraordinary blessing, and bring him a\nBible in his own native language, in such a remote part of the world,\nwhere His name was not known, and where it was never heard of that an\nEnglishman had ever been before. The enjoyment of this mercy was a great\ncomfort to him in captivity, and though he wanted no bodily convenience\nthat the country did afford; for the king, immediately after his\nfather's death, had sent an express order to the people of the towns,\nthat they should be kind to him, and give him good victuals; and after\nhe had been some time in the country, and understood the language,\nhe got him good conveniences, as a house and gardens; and falling\nto husbandry, God so prospered him, that he had plenty, not only for\nhimself, but to lend others; which being, according to the custom of the\ncountry, at 50 per cent. a year, much enriched him: he had also goats,\nwhich served him for mutton, and hogs and hens. Notwithstanding this, I\nsay, for he lived as fine as any of their noblemen, he could not so far\nforget his native country as to be contented to dwell in a strange land,\nwhere there was to him a famine of God's word and sacraments, the want\nof which made all other things to be of little value to him; therefore,\nas he made it his daily and fervent prayer to God, in His good time, to\nrestore him to both, so, at length, he, with one Stephen Rutland, who\nhad lived with him two years before, resolved to make their escape, and,\nabout the year 1673, meditated all secret ways to compass it. They had\nbefore taken up a way of peddling about the country, and buying tobacco,\npepper, garlic, combs, and all sorts of iron ware, and carried them into\nthose parts of the country where they wanted them; and now, to promote\ntheir design, as they went with their commodities from place to place,\nthey discoursed with the country people (for they could now speak their\nlanguage well) concerning the ways and inhabitants, where the isle was\nthinnest and fullest inhabited, where and how the watches lay from one\ncountry to another, and what commodities were proper for them to carry\ninto all parts; pretending that they would furnish themselves with such\nwares as the respective places wanted. None doubted but what they did\nwas upon the account of trade, because Mr Knox was so well seated, and\ncould not be supposed to leave such an estate, by travelling northward,\nbecause that part of the land was least inhabited; and so, furnishing\nthemselves with such wares as were vendible in those parts, they set\nforth, and steered their course towards the north part of the islands,\nknowing very little of the ways, which were generally intricate and\nperplexed, because they have no public roads, but a multitude of little\npaths from one town to another, and those often changing; and for white\nmen to inquire about the ways was very dangerous, because the people\nwould presently suspect their design.\n\nAt this time they travelled from Conde Uda as far as the country of\nNuwarakalawiya, which is the furthermost part of the king's dominions,\nand about three days' journey from their dwelling. They were very\nthankful to Providence that they had passed all difficulties so far,\nbut yet they durst not go any farther, because they had no wares left to\ntraffic with; and it being the first time they had been absent so long\nfrom home, they feared the townsmen would come after them to seek for\nthem; and so they returned home, and went eight or ten times into those\nparts with their wares, till they became well acquainted both with the\npeople and the paths.\n\nIn these parts Mr Knox met his black boy, whom he had turned away divers\nyears before. He had now got a wife and children, and was very poor;\nbut being acquainted with these quarters, he not only took directions\nof him, but agreed with him, for a good reward, to conduct him and\nhis companions to the Dutch. He gladly undertook it, and a time was\nappointed between them; but Mr Knox being disabled by a grievous pain,\nwhich seized him on his right side, and held him five days that he could\nnot travel, this appointment proved in vain; for though he went as\nsoon as he was well, his guide was gone into another country about his\nbusiness, and they durst not at that time venture to run away without\nhim.\n\nThese attempts took up eight or nine years, various accidents hindering\ntheir designs, but most commonly the dry weather, because they feared in\nthe woods they should be starved with thirst, all the country being in\nsuch a condition almost four or five years together for lack of rain.\n\nOn September 22, 1679, they set forth again, furnished with knives and\nsmall axes for their defence, because they could carry them privately\nand send all sorts of wares to sell as formerly, and all necessary\nprovisions, the moon being twenty-seven days old, that they might have\nlight to run away by, to try what success God Almighty would now give\nthem in seeking their liberty. Their first stage was to Anuradhapoora,\nin the way to which lay a wilderness, called Parraoth Mocolane, full of\nwild elephants, tigers, and bears; and because it is the utmost confines\nof the king's dominions, there is always a watch kept.\n\nIn the middle of the way they heard that the governor's officers of\nthese parts were out to gather up the king's revenues and duties, to\nsend them up to the city; which put them into no small fear, lest,\nfinding them, they should send them back again; whereupon they withdrew\nto the western parts of Ecpoulpot, and sat down to knitting till they\nheard the officers were gone. As soon as they were departed, they went\nonwards of their journey, having got a good parcel of cotton-yarn to\nknit caps with, and having kept their wares, as they pretended, to\nexchange for dried flesh, which was sold only in those lower parts.\nTheir way lay necessarily through the governor's yard at Kalluvilla, who\ndwells there on purpose to examine all that go and come. This greatly\ndistressed them, because he would easily suspect they were out of their\nbounds, being captives; however, they went resolutely to his house, and\nmeeting him, presented him with a small parcel of tobacco and betel;\nand, showing him their wares, told him they came to get dried flesh to\ncarry back with them. The governor did not suspect them, but told\nthem he was sorry they came in so dry a time, when no deer were to be\ncatched, but if some rain fell, he would soon supply them. This answer\npleased them, and they seemed contented to stay; and accordingly,\nabiding with him two or three days, and no rain falling, they presented\nthe governor with five or six charges of gunpowder, which is a rarity\namong them; and leaving a bundle at his house, they desired him to shoot\nthem some deer, while they made a step to Anuradhapoora. Here also they\nwere put in a great fright by the coming of certain soldiers from the\nking to the governor, to give him orders to set a secure guard at the\nwatches, that no suspicious persons might pass, which, though it was\nonly intended to prevent the flight of the relations of certain nobles\nwhom the king had clapped up, yet they feared they might wonder to see\nwhite men here, and so send them back again; but God so ordered it that\nthey were very kind to them and left them to their business, and so they\ngot safe to Anuradhapoora. Their pretence was dried flesh, though they\nknew there was none to be had; but their real business was to search the\nway down to the Dutch, which they stayed three days to do; but finding\nthat in the way to Jaffnapatam, which is one of the Dutch ports, there\nwas a watch which could hardly be passed, and other inconveniences not\nsurmountable, they resolved to go back, and take the river Malwatta Oya,\nwhich they had before judged would be a probable guide to lead them to\nthe sea; and, that they might not be pursued, left Anuradhapoora just at\nnight, when the people never travel for fear of wild beasts, on Sunday,\nOctober 12, being stored with all things needful for their journey,\nviz., ten days' provision, a basin to boil their provision in, two\ncalabashes to fetch water in, and two great tallipat leaves for tents,\nwith jaggery, sweetmeats, tobacco, betel, tinder-boxes, and a deerskin\nfor shoes, to keep their feet from thorns, because to them they chiefly\ntrusted. Being come to the river, they struck into the woods, and kept\nby the side of it; yet not going on the sand (lest their footsteps\nshould be discerned), unless forced, and then going backwards.\n\nBeing gotten a good way into the wood, it began to rain; wherefore they\nerected their tents, made a fire, and refreshed themselves against the\nrising of the moon, which was then eighteen days old; and having tied\ndeerskins about their feet, and eased themselves of their wares, they\nproceeded on their journey. When they had travelled three or four hours\nwith difficulty, because the moon gave but little light among the thick\ntrees, they found an elephant in their way before them, and because they\ncould not scare him away, they were forced to stay till morning; and so\nthey kindled a fire, and took a pipe of tobacco. By the light they could\nnot discern that ever anybody had been there, nothing being to be seen\nbut woods; and so they were in great hopes that they were past all\ndanger, being beyond all inhabitants; but they were mistaken, for the\nriver winding northward, brought them into the midst of a parcel of\ntowns, called Tissea Wava, where, being in danger of being seen, they\nwere under a mighty terror; for had the people found them, they would\nhave beat them, and sent them up to the king; and, to avoid it, they\ncrept into a hollow tree, and sat there in mud and wet till it began to\ngrow dark, and then betaking themselves to their legs, travelled till\nthe darkness of night stopped them. They heard voices behind them, and\nfeared it was somebody in pursuit of them; but at length, discerning\nit was only an hallooing to keep the wild beasts out of the corn, they\npitched their tents by the river, and having boiled rice and roasted\nmeat for their suppers, and satisfied their hunger, they committed\nthemselves to God's keeping, and laid them down to sleep.\n\nThe next morning, to prevent the worst, they got up early and hastened\non their journey; and though they were now got out of all danger of the\ntame Chiangulays, they were in great danger of the wild ones, of whom\nthose woods were full; and though they saw their tents, yet they were\nall gone, since the rains had fallen, from the river into the woods; and\nso God kept them from that danger, for, had they met the wild men, they\nhad been shot.\n\nThus they travelled from morning till night several days, through bushes\nand thorns, which made their arms and shoulders, which were naked,\nall of a gore blood. They often met with bears, hogs, deer, and wild\nbuffaloes; but they all ran away as soon as they saw them. The river was\nexceedingly full of alligators; in the evening they used to pitch their\ntents, and make great fires both before and behind them, to affright\nthe wild beasts; and though they heard the voices of all sorts, they saw\nnone.\n\nOn Thursday, at noon, they crossed the river Coronda [? Kannadera Oya],\nwhich parts the country of the Malabars from the king's, and on Friday,\nabout nine or ten in the morning, came among the inhabitants, of whom\nthey were as much afraid as of the Chiangulays before; for, though the\nWanniounay, or prince of this people, payeth tribute to the Dutch out\nof fear, yet he is better affected to the King of Kandy, and, if he had\ntook them, would have sent them up to their old master; but not knowing\nany way to escape, they kept on their journey by the river-side by day,\nbecause the woods were not to be travelled by night for thorns and wild\nbeasts, who came down then to the river to drink. In all the Malabar\ncountry they met with only two Brahmins, who treated them very civilly;\nand for their money, one of them conducted them till they came into the\nterritories of the Dutch, and out of all danger of the King of Kandy,\nwhich did not a little rejoice them; but yet they were in no small\ntrouble how to find the way out of the woods, till a Malabar, for the\nlucre of a knife, conducted them to a Dutch town, where they found\nguides to conduct them from town to town, till they came to the fort\ncalled Aripo, where they arrived Saturday, October 18, 1679, and there\nthankfully adored God's wonderful providence, in thus completing their\ndeliverance from a long captivity of nineteen years and six months.\n\nI come now back to my own history, which grows near a conclusion, as to\nthe travels I took in this part of the world. We were now at sea, and we\nstood away to the north for a while, to try if we could get a market for\nour spice, for we were very rich in nutmegs, but we ill knew what to\ndo with them; we durst not go upon the English coast, or, to speak more\nproperly, among the English factories to trade; not that we were afraid\nto fight any two ships they had, and, besides that, we knew that, as\nthey had no letters of marque, or of reprisals from the government, so\nit was none of their business to act offensively, no, not though we were\npirates. Indeed, if we had made any attempt upon them, they might have\njustified themselves in joining together to resist, and assisting one\nanother to defend themselves; but to go out of their business to attack\na pirate ship of almost fifty guns, as we were, it was plain that it was\nnone of their business, and consequently it was none of our concern, so\nwe did not trouble ourselves about it; but, on the other hand, it was\nnone of our business to be seen among them, and to have the news of us\ncarried from one factory to another, so that whatever design we might be\nupon at another time, we should be sure to be prevented and discovered.\nMuch less had we any occasion to be seen among any of the Dutch\nfactories upon the coast of Malabar; for, being fully laden with the\nspices which we had, in the sense of their trade, plundered them of, it\nwould have told them what we were, and all that we had been doing; and\nthey would, no doubt, have concerned themselves all manner of ways to\nhave fallen upon us.\n\nThe only way we had for it was to stand away for Goa, and trade, if we\ncould, for our spices, with the Portuguese factory there. Accordingly,\nwe sailed almost thither, for we had made land two days before, and\nbeing in the latitude of Goa, were standing in fair for Margaon, on the\nhead of Salsat, at the going up to Goa, when I called to the men at the\nhelm to bring the ship to, and bid the pilot go away N.N.W., till we\ncame out of sight of the shore, when William and I called a council,\nas we used to do upon emergencies, what course we should take to trade\nthere and not be discovered; and we concluded at length that we would\nnot go thither at all, but that William, with such trusty fellows only\nas could be depended upon, should go in the sloop to Surat, which was\nstill farther northward, and trade there as merchants with such of the\nEnglish factory as they could find to be for their turn.\n\nTo carry this with the more caution, and so as not to be suspected,\nwe agreed to take out all her guns, and put such men into her, and no\nother, as would promise us not to desire or offer to go on shore, or to\nenter into any talk or conversation with any that might come on board;\nand, to finish the disguise to our mind, William documented two of our\nmen, one a surgeon, as he himself was, and the other, a ready-witted\nfellow, an old sailor, that had been a pilot upon the coast of New\nEngland, and was an excellent mimic; these two William dressed up like\ntwo Quakers, and made them talk like such. The old pilot he made go\ncaptain of the sloop, and the surgeon for doctor, as he was, and himself\nsupercargo. In this figure, and the sloop all plain, no curled work upon\nher (indeed she had not much before), and no guns to be seen, away he\nwent for Surat.\n\nI should, indeed, have observed, that we went, some days before we\nparted, to a small sandy island close under the shore, where there was\na good cove of deep water, like a road, and out of sight of any of the\nfactories, which are here very thick upon the coast. Here we shifted the\nloading of the sloop, and put into her such things only as we had a mind\nto dispose of there, which was indeed little but nutmegs and cloves, but\nchiefly the former; and from thence William and his two Quakers, with\nabout eighteen men in the sloop, went away to Surat, and came to an\nanchor at a distance from the factory.\n\nWilliam used such caution that he found means to go on shore himself,\nand the doctor, as he called him, in a boat which came on board them\nto sell fish, rowed with only Indians of the country, which boat he\nafterwards hired to carry him on board again. It was not long that they\nwere on shore, but that they found means to get acquaintance with some\nEnglishmen, who, though they lived there, and perhaps were the company's\nservants at first, yet appeared then to be traders for themselves, in\nwhatever coast business especially came in their way; and the doctor was\nmade the first to pick acquaintance; so he recommended his friend, the\nsupercargo, till, by degrees, the merchants were as fond of the bargain\nas our men were of the merchants, only that the cargo was a little too\nmuch for them.\n\nHowever, this did not prove a difficulty long with them, for the next\nday they brought two more merchants, English also, into their bargain,\nand, as William could perceive by their discourse, they resolved, if\nthey bought them, to carry them to the Gulf of Persia upon their\nown accounts. William took the hint, and, as he told me afterwards,\nconcluded we might carry them there as well as they. But this was not\nWilliam's present business; he had here no less than three-and-thirty\nton of nuts and eighteen ton of cloves. There was a good quantity of\nmace among the nutmegs, but we did not stand to make much allowance. In\nshort, they bargained, and the merchants, who would gladly have bought\nsloop and all, gave William directions, and two men for pilots, to go\nto a creek about six leagues from the factory, where they brought boats,\nand unloaded the whole cargo, and paid William very honestly for it; the\nwhole parcel amounting, in money, to about thirty-five thousand pieces\nof eight, besides some goods of value, which William was content to\ntake, and two large diamonds, worth about three hundred pounds sterling.\n\nWhen they paid the money, William invited them on board the sloop, where\nthey came; and the merry old Quaker diverted them exceedingly with his\ntalk, and \"thee'd\" them and \"thou'd\" them till he made them so drunk\nthat they could not go on shore for that night.\n\nThey would fain have known who our people were, and whence they came;\nbut not a man in the sloop would answer them to any question they asked,\nbut in such a manner as let them think themselves bantered and jested\nwith. However, in discourse, William said they were able men for any\ncargo we could have brought them, and that they would have bought twice\nas much spice if we had had it. He ordered the merry captain to tell\nthem that they had another sloop that lay at Margaon, and that had a\ngreat quantity of spice on board also; and that, if it was not sold when\nhe went back (for that thither he was bound), he would bring her up.\n\nTheir new chaps were so eager, that they would have bargained with the\nold captain beforehand. \"Nay, friend,\" said he, \"I will not trade with\nthee unsight and unseen; neither do I know whether the master of the\nsloop may not have sold his loading already to some merchants of Salsat;\nbut if he has not when I come to him, I think to bring him up to thee.\"\n\nThe doctor had his employment all this while, as well as William and\nthe old captain, for he went on shore several times a day in the Indian\nboat, and brought fresh provisions for the sloop, which the men had need\nenough of. He brought, in particular, seventeen large casks of arrack,\nas big as butts, besides smaller quantities, a quantity of rice, and\nabundance of fruits, mangoes, pompions, and such things, with fowls and\nfish. He never came on board but he was deep laden; for, in short, he\nbought for the ship as well as for themselves; and, particularly, they\nhalf-loaded the ship with rice and arrack, with some hogs, and six\nor seven cows, alive; and thus, being well victualled, and having\ndirections for coming again, they returned to us.\n\nWilliam was always the lucky welcome messenger to us, but never more\nwelcome to us than now; for where we had thrust in the ship, we could\nget nothing, except a few mangoes and roots, being not willing to make\nany steps into the country, or make ourselves known till we had news of\nour sloop; and indeed our men's patience was almost tired, for it\nwas seventeen days that William spent upon this enterprise, and well\nbestowed too.\n\nWhen he came back we had another conference upon the subject of trade,\nnamely, whether we should send the best of our spices, and other goods\nwe had in the ship, to Surat, or whether we should go up to the Gulf of\nPersia ourselves, where it was probable we might sell them as well as\nthe English merchants of Surat. William was for going ourselves, which,\nby the way, was from the good, frugal, merchant-like temper of the man,\nwho was for the best of everything; but here I overruled William, which\nI very seldom took upon me to do; but I told him, that, considering our\ncircumstances, it was much better for us to sell all our cargoes here,\nthough we made but half-price of them, than to go with them to the Gulf\nof Persia, where we should run a greater risk, and where people would be\nmuch more curious and inquisitive into things than they were here, and\nwhere it would not be so easy to manage them, seeing they traded freely\nand openly there, not by stealth, as those men seemed to do; and,\nbesides, if they suspected anything, it would be much more difficult for\nus to retreat, except by mere force, than here, where we were upon the\nhigh sea as it were, and could be gone whenever we pleased, without any\ndisguise, or, indeed, without the least appearance of being pursued,\nnone knowing where to look for us.\n\nMy apprehensions prevailed with William, whether my reasons did or no,\nand he submitted; and we resolved to try another ship's loading to the\nsame merchants. The main business was to consider how to get off that\ncircumstance that had exposed them to the English merchants, namely that\nit was our other sloop; but this the old Quaker pilot undertook; for\nbeing, as I said, an excellent mimic himself, it was the easier for\nhim to dress up the sloop in new clothes; and first, he put on all the\ncarved work he had taken off before; her stern, which was painted of\na dumb white or dun colour before, all flat, was now all lacquered and\nblue, and I know not how many gay figures in it; as to her quarter, the\ncarpenters made her a neat little gallery on either side; she had twelve\nguns put into her, and some petereroes upon her gunnel, none of which\nwere there before; and to finish her new habit or appearance, and make\nher change complete, he ordered her sails to be altered; and as she\nsailed before with a half-sprit, like a yacht, she sailed now with\nsquare-sail and mizzen-mast, like a ketch; so that, in a word, she was a\nperfect cheat, disguised in everything that a stranger could be supposed\nto take any notice of that had never had but one view, for they had been\nbut once on board.\n\nIn this mean figure the sloop returned; she had a new man put into her\nfor captain, one we knew how to trust; and the old pilot appearing only\nas a passenger, the doctor and William acting as the supercargoes, by a\nformal procuration from one Captain Singleton, and all things ordered in\nform.\n\nWe had a complete loading for the sloop; for, besides a very great\nquantity of nutmegs and cloves, mace, and some cinnamon, she had\non board some goods which we took in as we lay about the Philippine\nIslands, while we waited as looking for purchase.\n\nWilliam made no difficulty of selling this cargo also, and in about\ntwenty days returned again, freighted with all necessary provisions for\nour voyage, and for a long time; and, as I say, we had a great deal of\nother goods: he brought us back about three-and-thirty thousand pieces\nof eight, and some diamonds, which, though William did not pretend to\nmuch skill in, yet he made shift to act so as not to be imposed upon,\nthe merchants he had to deal with, too, being very fair men.\n\nThey had no difficulty at all with these merchants, for the prospect\nthey had of gain made them not at all inquisitive, nor did they make the\nleast discovery of the sloop; and as to the selling them spices which\nwere fetched so far from thence, it seems it was not so much a novelty\nthere as we believed, for the Portuguese had frequently vessels which\ncame from Macao in China, who brought spices, which they bought of\nthe Chinese traders, who again frequently dealt among the Dutch Spice\nIslands, and received spices in exchange for such goods as they carried\nfrom China.\n\nThis might be called, indeed, the only trading voyage we had made; and\nnow we were really very rich, and it came now naturally before us to\nconsider whither we should go next. Our proper delivery port, as we\nought to have called it, was at Madagascar, in the Bay of Mangahelly;\nbut William took me by myself into the cabin of the sloop one day,\nand told me he wanted to talk seriously with me a little; so we shut\nourselves in, and William began with me.\n\n\"Wilt thou give me leave,\" says William, \"to talk plainly with thee upon\nthy present circumstances, and thy future prospect of living? and wilt\nthou promise, on thy word, to take nothing ill of me?\"\n\n\"With all my heart,\" said I. \"William, I have always found your advice\ngood, and your designs have not only been well laid, but your counsel\nhas been very lucky to us; and, therefore, say what you will, I promise\nyou I will not take it ill.\"\n\n\"But that is not all my demand,\" says William; \"if thou dost not like\nwhat I am going to propose to thee, thou shalt promise me not to make it\npublic among the men.\"\n\n\"I will not, William,\" says I, \"upon my word;\" and swore to him, too,\nvery heartily.\n\n\"Why, then,\" says William, \"I have but one thing more to article with\nthee about, and that is, that thou wilt consent that if thou dost not\napprove of it for thyself, thou wilt yet consent that I shall put so\nmuch of it in practice as relates to myself and my new comrade doctor,\nso that it be nothing to thy detriment and loss.\"\n\n\"In anything,\" says I, \"William, but leaving me, I will; but I cannot\npart with you upon any terms whatever.\"\n\n\"Well,\" says William, \"I am not designing to part from thee, unless it\nis thy own doing. But assure me in all these points, and I will tell my\nmind freely.\"\n\nSo I promised him everything he desired of me in the solemnest manner\npossible, and so seriously and frankly withal, that William made no\nscruple to open his mind to me.\n\n\"Why, then, in the first place,\" says William, \"shall I ask thee if thou\ndost not think thou and all thy men are rich enough, and have really\ngotten as much wealth together (by whatsoever way it has been gotten,\nthat is not the question) as we all know what to do with?\"\n\n\"Why, truly, William,\" said I, \"thou art pretty right; I think we have\nhad pretty good luck.\"\n\n\"Well, then,\" says William, \"I would ask whether, if thou hast gotten\nenough, thou hast any thought of leaving off this trade; for most people\nleave off trading when they are satisfied of getting, and are rich\nenough; for nobody trades for the sake of trading; much less do men rob\nfor the sake of thieving.\"\n\n\"Well, William,\" says I, \"now I perceive what it is thou art driving at.\nI warrant you,\" says I, \"you begin to hanker after home.\"\n\n\"Why, truly,\" says William, \"thou hast said it, and so I hope thou dost\ntoo. It is natural for most men that are abroad to desire to come home\nagain at last, especially when they are grown rich, and when they are\n(as thou ownest thyself to be) rich enough, and so rich as they know not\nwhat to do with more if they had it.\"\n\n\"Well, William,\" said I, \"but now you think you have laid your\npreliminary at first so home that I should have nothing to say; that is,\nthat when I had got money enough, it would be natural to think of going\nhome. But you have not explained what you mean by home, and there you\nand I shall differ. Why, man, I am at home; here is my habitation; I\nnever had any other in my lifetime; I was a kind of charity school boy;\nso that I can have no desire of going anywhere for being rich or poor,\nfor I have nowhere to go.\"\n\n\"Why,\" says William, looking a little confused, \"art not thou an\nEnglishman?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" says I, \"I think so: you see I speak English; but I came out of\nEngland a child, and never was in it but once since I was a man; and\nthen I was cheated and imposed upon, and used so ill that I care not if\nI never see it more.\"\n\n\"Why, hast thou no relations or friends there?\" says he; \"no\nacquaintance--none that thou hast any kindness or any remains of respect\nfor?\"\n\n\"Not I, William,\" said I; \"no more than I have in the court of the Great\nMogul.\"\n\n\"Nor any kindness for the country where thou wast born?\" says William.\n\n\"Not I, any more than for the island of Madagascar, nor so much neither;\nfor that has been a fortunate island to me more than once, as thou\nknowest, William,\" said I.\n\nWilliam was quite stunned at my discourse, and held his peace; and I\nsaid to him, \"Go on, William; what hast thou to say farther? for I hear\nyou have some project in your head,\" says I; \"come, let's have it out.\"\n\n\"Nay,\" says William, \"thou hast put me to silence, and all I had to say\nis overthrown; all my projects are come to nothing, and gone.\"\n\n\"Well, but, William,\" said I, \"let me hear what they were; for though\nit is so that what I have to aim at does not look your way, and though\nI have no relation, no friend, no acquaintance in England, yet I do not\nsay I like this roving, cruising life so well as never to give it over.\nLet me hear if thou canst propose to me anything beyond it.\"\n\n\"Certainly, friend,\" says William, very gravely, \"there is something\nbeyond it;\" and lifting up his hands, he seemed very much affected, and\nI thought I saw tears stand in his eyes; but I, that was too hardened\na wretch to be moved with these things, laughed at him. \"What!\" says I,\n\"you mean death, I warrant you: don't you? That is beyond this trade.\nWhy, when it comes, it comes; then we are all provided for.\"\n\n\"Ay,\" says William, \"that is true; but it would be better that some\nthings were thought on before that came.\"\n\n\"Thought on!\" says I; \"what signifies thinking of it? To think of death\nis to die, and to be always thinking of it is to be all one's life long\na-dying. It is time enough to think of it when it comes.\"\n\nYou will easily believe I was well qualified for a pirate that could\ntalk thus. But let me leave it upon record, for the remark of other\nhardened rogues like myself,--my conscience gave me a pang that I never\nfelt before when I said, \"What signifies thinking of it?\" and told me I\nshould one day think of these words with a sad heart; but the time of my\nreflection was not yet come; so I went on.\n\nSays William very seriously, \"I must tell thee, friend, I am sorry to\nhear thee talk so. They that never think of dying, often die without\nthinking of it.\"\n\nI carried on the jesting way a while farther, and said, \"Prithee, do not\ntalk of dying; how do we know we shall ever die?\" and began to laugh.\n\n\"I need not answer thee to that,\" says William; \"it is not my place to\nreprove thee, who art commander over me here; but I would rather thou\nwouldst talk otherwise of death; it is a coarse thing.\"\n\n\"Say anything to me, William,\" said I; \"I will take it kindly.\" I began\nnow to be very much moved at his discourse.\n\nSays William (tears running down his face), \"It is because men live\nas if they were never to die, that so many die before they know how\nto live. But it was not death that I meant when I said that there was\nsomething to be thought of beyond this way of living.\"\n\n\"Why, William,\" said I, \"what was that?\"\n\n\"It was repentance,\" says he.\n\n\"Why,\" says I, \"did you ever know a pirate repent?\"\n\nAt this he startled a little, and returned, \"At the gallows I have\n[known] one before, and I hope thou wilt be the second.\"\n\nHe spoke this very affectionately, with an appearance of concern for me.\n\n\"Well, William,\" says I, \"I thank you; and I am not so senseless of\nthese things, perhaps, as I make myself seem to be. But come, let me\nhear your proposal.\"\n\n\"My proposal,\" says William, \"is for thy good as well as my own. We may\nput an end to this kind of life, and repent; and I think the fairest\noccasion offers for both, at this very time, that ever did, or ever\nwill, or, indeed, can happen again.\"\n\n\"Look you, William,\" says I; \"let me have your proposal for putting an\nend to our present way of living first, for that is the case before\nus, and you and I will talk of the other afterwards. I am not so\ninsensible,\" said I, \"as you may think me to be. But let us get out of\nthis hellish condition we are in first.\"\n\n\"Nay,\" says William, \"thou art in the right there; we must never talk of\nrepenting while we continue pirates.\"\n\n\"Well,\" says I, \"William, that's what I meant; for if we must not\nreform, as well as be sorry for what is done, I have no notion what\nrepentance means; indeed, at best I know little of the matter; but the\nnature of the thing seems to tell me that the first step we have to take\nis to break off this wretched course; and I'll begin there with you,\nwith all my heart.\"\n\nI could see by his countenance that William was thoroughly pleased with\nthe offer; and if he had tears in-his eyes before, he had more now; but\nit was from quite a different passion; for he was so swallowed up with\njoy he could not speak.\n\n\"Come, William,\" says I, \"thou showest me plain enough thou hast an\nhonest meaning; dost thou think it practicable for us to put an end to\nour unhappy way of living here, and get off?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" says he, \"I think it very practicable for me; whether it is for\nthee or no, that will depend upon thyself.\"\n\n\"Well,\" says I, \"I give you my word, that as I have commanded you all\nalong, from the time I first took you on board, so you shall command me\nfrom this hour, and everything you direct me I'll do.\"\n\n\"Wilt thou leave it all to me? Dost thou say this freely?\"\n\n\"Yes, William,\" said I, \"freely; and I'll perform it faithfully.\"\n\n\"Why, then,\" says William, \"my scheme is this: We are now at the mouth\nof the Gulf of Persia; we have sold so much of our cargo here at Surat,\nthat we have money enough; send me away for Bassorah with the sloop,\nladen with the China goods we have on board, which will make another\ngood cargo, and I'll warrant thee I'll find means, among the English and\nDutch merchants there, to lodge a quantity of goods and money also as\na merchant, so as we will be able to have recourse to it again upon any\noccasion, and when I come home we will contrive the rest; and, in the\nmeantime, do you bring the ship's crew to take a resolution to go to\nMadagascar as soon as I return.\"\n\nI told him I thought he need not go so far as Bassorah, but might run\ninto Gombroon, or to Ormuz, and pretend the same business.\n\n\"No,\" says he, \"I cannot act with the same freedom there, because\nthe Company's factories are there, and I may be laid hold of there on\npretence of interloping.\"\n\n\"Well, but,\" said I, \"you may go to Ormuz, then; for I am loth to\npart with you so long as to go to the bottom of the Persian Gulf.\" He\nreturned, that I should leave it to him to do as he should see cause.\n\nWe had taken a large sum of money at Surat, so that we had near a\nhundred thousand pounds in money at our command, but on board the great\nship we had still a great deal more.\n\nI ordered him publicly to keep the money on board which he had, and to\nbuy up with it a quantity of ammunition, if he could get it, and so to\nfurnish us for new exploits; and, in the meantime, I resolved to get a\nquantity of gold and some jewels, which I had on board the great ship,\nand place them so that I might carry them off without notice as soon as\nhe came back; and so, according to William's directions, I left him\nto go the voyage, and I went on board the great ship, in which we had\nindeed an immense treasure.\n\nWe waited no less than two months for William's return, and indeed\nI began to be very uneasy about William, sometimes thinking he had\nabandoned me, and that he might have used the same artifice to have\nengaged the other men to comply with him, and so they were gone away\ntogether; and it was but three days before his return that I was just\nupon the point of resolving to go away to Madagascar, and give him over;\nbut the old surgeon, who mimicked the Quaker and passed for the master\nof the sloop at Surat, persuaded me against that, for which good advice\nand apparent faithfulness in what he had been trusted with, I made him a\nparty to my design, and he proved very honest.\n\nAt length William came back, to our inexpressible joy, and brought a\ngreat many necessary things with him; as, particularly, he brought sixty\nbarrels of powder, some iron shot, and about thirty ton of lead; also\nhe brought a great deal of provisions; and, in a word, William gave me\na public account of his voyage, in the hearing of whoever happened to be\nupon the quarter-deck, that no suspicions might be found about us.\n\nAfter all was done, William moved that he might go up again, and that\nI would go with him; named several things which we had on board that he\ncould not sell there; and, particularly, told us he had been obliged to\nleave several things there, the caravans being not come in; and that he\nhad engaged to come back again with goods.\n\nThis was what I wanted. The men were eager for his going, and\nparticularly because he told them they might load the sloop back with\nrice and provisions; but I seemed backward to going, when the old\nsurgeon stood up and persuaded me to go, and with many arguments pressed\nme to it; as, particularly, if I did not go, there would be no order,\nand several of the men might drop away, and perhaps betray all the rest;\nand that they should not think it safe for the sloop to go again if I\ndid not go; and to urge me to it, he offered himself to go with me.\n\nUpon these considerations I seemed to be over-persuaded to go, and all\nthe company seemed to be better satisfied when I had consented; and,\naccordingly, we took all the powder, lead, and iron out of the sloop\ninto the great ship, and all the other things that were for the ship's\nuse, and put in some bales of spices and casks or frails of cloves, in\nall about seven ton, and some other goods, among the bales of which I\nhad conveyed all my private treasure, which, I assure you, was of no\nsmall value, and away I went.\n\nAt going off I called a council of all the officers in the ship to\nconsider in what place they should wait for me, and how long, and we\nappointed the ship to stay eight-and-twenty days at a little island on\nthe Arabian side of the Gulf, and that, if the sloop did not come in\nthat time, they should sail to another island to the west of that place,\nand wait there fifteen days more, and that then, if the sloop did not\ncome, they should conclude some accident must have happened, and the\nrendezvous should be at Madagascar.\n\nBeing thus resolved, we left the ship, which both William and I, and\nthe surgeon, never intended to see any more. We steered directly for the\nGulf, and through to Bassorah, or Balsara. This city of Balsara lies\nat some distance from the place where our sloop lay, and the river\nnot being very safe, and we but ill acquainted with it, having but an\nordinary pilot, we went on shore at a village where some merchants live,\nand which is very populous, for the sake of small vessels riding there.\n\nHere we stayed and traded three or four days, landing all our bales and\nspices, and indeed the whole cargo that was of any considerable value,\nwhich we chose to do rather than go up immediately to Balsara till the\nproject we had laid was put in execution.\n\nAfter we had bought several goods, and were preparing to buy several\nothers, the boat being on shore with twelve men, myself, William, the\nsurgeon, and one fourth man, whom we had singled out, we contrived\nto send a Turk just at the dusk of the evening with a letter to the\nboatswain, and giving the fellow a charge to run with all possible\nspeed, we stood at a small distance to observe the event. The contents\nof the letter were thus written by the old doctor:--\n\n\"BOATSWAIN THOMAS,--We are all betrayed. For God's sake make off with\nthe boat, and get on board, or you are all lost. The captain, William\nthe Quaker, and George the reformade are seized and carried away: I am\nescaped and hid, but cannot stir out; if I do I am a dead man. As\nsoon as you are on board cut or slip, and make sail for your lives.\nAdieu.--R.S.\"\n\nWe stood undiscovered, as above, it being the dusk of the evening, and\nsaw the Turk deliver the letter, and in three minutes we saw all the men\nhurry into the boat and put off, and no sooner were they on board than\nthey took the hint, as we supposed, for the next morning they were out\nof sight, and we never heard tale or tidings of them since.\n\nWe were now in a good place, and in very good circumstances, for we\npassed for merchants of Persia.\n\nIt is not material to record here what a mass of ill-gotten wealth we\nhad got together: it will be more to the purpose to tell you that I\nbegan to be sensible of the crime of getting of it in such a manner as\nI had done; that I had very little satisfaction in the possession of\nit; and, as I told William, I had no expectation of keeping it, nor much\ndesire; but, as I said to him one day walking out into the fields near\nthe town of Bassorah, so I depended upon it that it would be the case,\nwhich you will hear presently.\n\nWe were perfectly secured at Bassorah, by having frighted away the\nrogues, our comrades; and we had nothing to do but to consider how to\nconvert our treasure into things proper to make us look like merchants,\nas we were now to be, and not like freebooters, as we really had been.\n\nWe happened very opportunely here upon a Dutchman, who had travelled\nfrom Bengal to Agra, the capital city of the Great Mogul, and from\nthence was come to the coast of Malabar by land, and got shipping,\nsomehow or other, up the Gulf; and we found his design was to go up the\ngreat river to Bagdad or Babylon, and so, by the caravan, to Aleppo and\nScanderoon. As William spoke Dutch, and was of an agreeable, insinuating\nbehaviour, he soon got acquainted with this Dutchman, and discovering\nour circumstances to one another, we found he had considerable effects\nwith him; and that he had traded long in that country, and was making\nhomeward to his own country; and that he had servants with him; one an\nArmenian, whom he had taught to speak Dutch, and who had something of\nhis own, but had a mind to travel into Europe; and the other a Dutch\nsailor, whom he had picked up by his fancy, and reposed a great trust in\nhim, and a very honest fellow he was.\n\nThis Dutchman was very glad of an acquaintance, because he soon found\nthat we directed our thoughts to Europe also; and as he found we were\nencumbered with goods only (for we let him know nothing of our money),\nhe readily offered us his assistance to dispose of as many of them as\nthe place we were in would put off, and his advice what to do with the\nrest.\n\nWhile this was doing, William and I consulted what to do with ourselves\nand what we had; and first, we resolved we would never talk seriously\nof our measures but in the open fields, where we were sure nobody could\nhear; so every evening, when the sun began to decline and the air to be\nmoderate we walked out, sometimes this way, sometimes that, to consult\nof our affairs.\n\nI should have observed that we had new clothed ourselves here, after\nthe Persian manner, with long vests of silk, a gown or robe of English\ncrimson cloth, very fine and handsome, and had let our beards grow so\nafter the Persian manner that we passed for Persian merchants, in view\nonly, though, by the way, we could not understand or speak one word of\nthe language of Persia, or indeed of any other but English and Dutch;\nand of the latter I understood very little.\n\nHowever, the Dutchman supplied all this for us; and as we had resolved\nto keep ourselves as retired as we could, though there were several\nEnglish merchants upon the place, yet we never acquainted ourselves with\none of them, or exchanged a word with them; by which means we prevented\ntheir inquiry of us now, or their giving any intelligence of us, if any\nnews of our landing here should happen to come, which, it was easy for\nus to know, was possible enough, if any of our comrades fell into bad\nhands, or by many accidents which we could not foresee.\n\nIt was during my being here, for here we stayed near two months, that\nI grew very thoughtful about my circumstances; not as to the danger,\nneither indeed were we in any, but were entirely concealed and\nunsuspected; but I really began to have other thoughts of myself, and of\nthe world, than ever I had before.\n\nWilliam had struck so deep into my unthinking temper with hinting to me\nthat there was something beyond all this; that the present time was the\ntime of enjoyment, but that the time of account approached; that the\nwork that remained was gentler than the labour past, viz., repentance,\nand that it was high time to think of it;--I say these, and such\nthoughts as these, engrossed my hours, and, in a word, I grew very sad.\n\nAs to the wealth I had, which was immensely great, it was all like dirt\nunder my feet; I had no value for it, no peace in the possession of it,\nno great concern about me for the leaving of it.\n\nWilliam had perceived my thoughts to be troubled and my mind heavy and\noppressed for some time; and one evening, in one of our cool walks, I\nbegan with him about the leaving our effects. William was a wise and\nwary man, and indeed all the prudentials of my conduct had for a long\ntime been owing to his advice, and so now all the methods for preserving\nour effects, and even ourselves, lay upon him; and he had been telling\nme of some of the measures he had been taking for our making homeward,\nand for the security of our wealth, when I took him very short. \"Why,\nWilliam,\" says I, \"dost thou think we shall ever be able to reach Europe\nwith all this cargo that we have about us?\"\n\n\"Ay,\" says William, \"without doubt, as well as other merchants with\ntheirs, as long as it is not publicly known what quantity or of what\nvalue our cargo consists.\"\n\n\"Why, William,\" says I, smiling, \"do you think that if there is a God\nabove, as you have so long been telling me there is, and that we must\ngive an account to Him,--I say, do you think, if He be a righteous\nJudge, He will let us escape thus with the plunder, as we may call it,\nof so many innocent people, nay, I might say nations, and not call us to\nan account for it before we can get to Europe, where we pretend to enjoy\nit?\"\n\nWilliam appeared struck and surprised at the question, and made no\nanswer for a great while; and I repeated the question, adding that it\nwas not to be expected.\n\nAfter a little pause, says William, \"Thou hast started a very weighty\nquestion, and I can make no positive answer to it; but I will state it\nthus: first, it is true that, if we consider the justice of God, we\nhave no reason to expect any protection; but as the ordinary ways of\nProvidence are out of the common road of human affairs, so we may hope\nfor mercy still upon our repentance, and we know not how good He may be\nto us; so we are to act as if we rather depended upon the last, I mean\nthe merciful part, than claimed the first, which must produce nothing\nbut judgment and vengeance.\"\n\n\"But hark ye, William,\" says I, \"the nature of repentance, as you have\nhinted once to me, included reformation; and we can never reform; how,\nthen, can we repent?\"\n\n\"Why can we never reform?\" says William.\n\n\"Because,\" said I, \"we cannot restore what we have taken away by rapine\nand spoil.\"\n\n\"It is true,\" says William, \"we never can do that, for we can never come\nto the knowledge of the owners.\"\n\n\"But what, then, must be done with our wealth,\" said I, \"the effects\nof plunder and rapine? If we keep it, we continue to be robbers and\nthieves; and if we quit it we cannot do justice with it, for we cannot\nrestore it to the right owners.\"\n\n\"Nay,\" says William, \"the answer to it is short. To quit what we have,\nand do it here, is to throw it away to those who have no claim to it,\nand to divest ourselves of it, but to do no right with it; whereas we\nought to keep it carefully together, with a resolution to do what right\nwith it we are able; and who knows what opportunity Providence may\nput into our hands to do justice, at least, to some of those we have\ninjured? So we ought, at least, to leave it to Him and go on. As it is,\nwithout doubt our present business is to go to some place of safety,\nwhere we may wait His will.\"\n\nThis resolution of William was very satisfying to me indeed, as, the\ntruth is, all he said, and at all times, was solid and good; and had\nnot William thus, as it were, quieted my mind, I think, verily, I was so\nalarmed at the just reason I had to expect vengeance from Heaven upon\nme for my ill-gotten wealth, that I should have run away from it as the\ndevil's goods, that I had nothing to do with, that did not belong to\nme, and that I had no right to keep, and was in certain danger of being\ndestroyed for.\n\nHowever, William settled my mind to more prudent steps than these, and\nI concluded that I ought, however, to proceed to a place of safety,\nand leave the event to God Almighty's mercy. But this I must leave upon\nrecord, that I had from this time no joy of the wealth I had got. I\nlooked upon it all as stolen, and so indeed the greatest part of it was.\nI looked upon it as a hoard of other men's goods, which I had robbed the\ninnocent owners of, and which I ought, in a word, to be hanged for here,\nand damned for hereafter. And now, indeed, I began sincerely to hate\nmyself for a dog; a wretch that had been a thief and a murderer; a\nwretch that was in a condition which nobody was ever in; for I had\nrobbed, and though I had the wealth by me, yet it was impossible I\nshould ever make any restitution; and upon this account it ran in my\nhead that I could never repent, for that repentance could not be sincere\nwithout restitution, and therefore must of necessity be damned. There\nwas no room for me to escape. I went about with my heart full of these\nthoughts, little better than a distracted fellow; in short, running\nheadlong into the dreadfullest despair, and premeditating nothing but\nhow to rid myself out of the world; and, indeed, the devil, if such\nthings are of the devil's immediate doing, followed his work very close\nwith me, and nothing lay upon my mind for several days but to shoot\nmyself into the head with my pistol.\n\nI was all this while in a vagrant life, among infidels, Turks, pagans,\nand such sort of people. I had no minister, no Christian to converse\nwith but poor William. He was my ghostly father or confessor, and he was\nall the comfort I had. As for my knowledge of religion, you have heard\nmy history. You may suppose I had not much; and as for the Word of\nGod, I do not remember that I ever read a chapter in the Bible in my\nlifetime. I was little Bob at Bussleton, and went to school to learn my\nTestament.\n\nHowever, it pleased God to make William the Quaker everything to me.\nUpon this occasion, I took him out one evening, as usual, and hurried\nhim away into the fields with me, in more haste than ordinary; and\nthere, in short, I told him the perplexity of my mind, and under what\nterrible temptations of the devil I had been; that I must shoot myself,\nfor I could not support the weight and terror that was upon me.\n\n\"Shoot yourself!\" says William; \"why, what will that do for you?\"\n\n\"Why,\" says I, \"it will put an end to a miserable life.\"\n\n\"Well,\" says William, \"are you satisfied the next will be better?\"\n\n\"No, no,\" says I; \"much worse, to be sure.\"\n\n\"Why, then,\" says he, \"shooting yourself is the devil's motion, no\ndoubt; for it is the devil of a reason, that, because thou art in an ill\ncase, therefore thou must put thyself into a worse.\"\n\nThis shocked my reason indeed. \"Well, but,\" says I, \"there is no bearing\nthe miserable condition I am in.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" says William; \"but it seems there is some bearing a worse\ncondition; and so you will shoot yourself, that you may be past remedy?\"\n\n\"I am past remedy already,\" says I.\n\n\"How do you know that?\" says he.\n\n\"I am satisfied of it,\" said I.\n\n\"Well,\" says he, \"but you are not sure; so you will shoot yourself to\nmake it certain; for though on this side death you cannot be sure you\nwill be damned at all, yet the moment you step on the other side of time\nyou are sure of it; for when it is done, it is not to be said then that\nyou will be, but that you are damned.\"\n\n\"Well, but,\" says William, as if he had been between jest and earnest,\n\"pray, what didst thou dream of last night?\"\n\n\"Why,\" said I, \"I had frightful dreams all night; and, particularly, I\ndreamed that the devil came for me, and asked me what my name was; and\nI told him. Then he asked me what trade I was. 'Trade?' says I; 'I am a\nthief, a rogue, by my calling: I am a pirate and a murderer, and ought\nto be hanged.' 'Ay, ay,' says the devil, 'so you do; and you are the\nman I looked for, and therefore come along with me.' At which I was most\nhorribly frighted, and cried out so that it waked me; and I have been in\nhorrible agony ever since.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" says William; \"come, give me the pistol thou talkedst of\njust now.\"\n\n\"Why,\" says I, \"what will you do with it?\"\n\n\"Do with it!\" says William. \"Why, thou needest not shoot thyself; I\nshall be obliged to do it for thee. Why, thou wilt destroy us all.\"\n\n\"What do you mean, William?\" said I.\n\n\"Mean!\" said he; \"nay, what didst thou mean, to cry out aloud in thy\nsleep, 'I am a thief, a pirate, a murderer, and ought to be hanged'?\nWhy, thou wilt ruin us all. 'Twas well the Dutchman did not understand\nEnglish. In short, I must shoot thee, to save my own life. Come, come,\"\nsays he, \"give me thy pistol.\"\n\nI confess this terrified me again another way, and I began to be\nsensible that, if anybody had been near me to understand English, I had\nbeen undone. The thought of shooting myself forsook me from that time;\nand I turned to William, \"You disorder me extremely, William,\" said I;\n\"why, I am never safe, nor is it safe to keep me company. What shall I\ndo? I shall betray you all.\"\n\n\"Come, come, friend Bob,\" says he, \"I'll put an end to it all, if you\nwill take my advice.\"\n\n\"How's that?\" said I.\n\n\"Why, only,\" says he, \"that the next time thou talkest with the devil,\nthou wilt talk a little softlier, or we shall be all undone, and you\ntoo.\"\n\nThis frighted me, I must confess, and allayed a great deal of the\ntrouble of mind I was in. But William, after he had done jesting with\nme, entered upon a very long and serious discourse with me about the\nnature of my circumstances, and about repentance; that it ought to be\nattended, indeed, with a deep abhorrence of the crime that I had to\ncharge myself with; but that to despair of God's mercy was no part of\nrepentance, but putting myself into the condition of the devil; indeed,\nthat I must apply myself with a sincere, humble confession of my crime,\nto ask pardon of God, whom I had offended, and cast myself upon His\nmercy, resolving to be willing to make restitution, if ever it should\nplease God to put it in my power, even to the utmost of what I had in\nthe world. And this, he told me, was the method which he had resolved\nupon himself; and in this, he told me, he had found comfort.\n\nI had a great deal of satisfaction in William's discourse, and it\nquieted me very much; but William was very anxious ever after about my\ntalking in my sleep, and took care to lie with me always himself, and to\nkeep me from lodging in any house where so much as a word of English was\nunderstood.\n\nHowever, there was not the like occasion afterward; for I was much\nmore composed in my mind, and resolved for the future to live a quite\ndifferent life from what I had done. As to the wealth I had, I looked\nupon it as nothing; I resolved to set it apart to any such opportunity\nof doing justice as God should put into my hand; and the miraculous\nopportunity I had afterwards of applying some parts of it to preserve\na ruined family, whom I had plundered, may be worth reading, if I have\nroom for it in this account.\n\nWith these resolutions I began to be restored to some degree of quiet\nin my mind; and having, after almost three months' stay at Bassorah,\ndisposed of some goods, but having a great quantity left, we hired\nboats according to the Dutchman's direction, and went up to Bagdad,\nor Babylon, on the river Tigris, or rather Euphrates. We had a very\nconsiderable cargo of goods with us, and therefore made a great\nfigure there, and were received with respect. We had, in particular,\ntwo-and-forty bales of Indian stuffs of sundry sorts, silks, muslins,\nand fine chintz; we had fifteen bales of very fine China silks, and\nseventy packs or bales of spices, particularly cloves and nutmegs, with\nother goods. We were bid money here for our cloves, but the Dutchman\nadvised us not to part with them, and told us we should get a better\nprice at Aleppo, or in the Levant; so we prepared for the caravan.\n\nWe concealed our having any gold or pearls as much as we could, and\ntherefore sold three or four bales of China silks and Indian calicoes,\nto raise money to buy camels and to pay the customs which are taken at\nseveral places, and for our provisions over the deserts.\n\nI travelled this journey, careless to the last degree of my goods or\nwealth, believing that, as I came by it all by rapine and violence, God\nwould direct that it should be taken from me again in the same manner;\nand, indeed, I think I might say I was very willing it should be so.\nBut, as I had a merciful Protector above me, so I had a most faithful\nsteward, counsellor, partner, or whatever I might call him, who was my\nguide, my pilot, my governor, my everything, and took care both of me\nand of all we had; and though he had never been in any of these parts\nof the world, yet he took the care of all upon him; and in about\nnine-and-fifty days we arrived from Bassorah, at the mouth of the\nriver Tigris or Euphrates, through the desert, and through Aleppo to\nAlexandria, or, as we call it, Scanderoon, in the Levant.\n\nHere William and I, and the other two, our faithful comrades, debated\nwhat we should do; and here William and I resolved to separate from the\nother two, they resolving to go with the Dutchman into Holland, by the\nmeans of some Dutch ship which lay then in the road. William and I told\nthem we resolved to go and settle in the Morea, which then belonged to\nthe Venetians.\n\nIt is true we acted wisely in it not to let them know whither we\nwent, seeing we had resolved to separate; but we took our old doctor's\ndirections how to write to him in Holland, and in England, that we might\nhave intelligence from him on occasion, and promised to give him an\naccount how to write to us, which we afterwards did, as may in time be\nmade out.\n\nWe stayed here some time after they were gone, till at length, not being\nthoroughly resolved whither to go till then, a Venetian ship touched at\nCyprus, and put in at Scanderoon to look for freight home. We took the\nhint, and bargaining for our passage, and the freight of our goods, we\nembarked for Venice, where, in two-and-twenty days, we arrived safe,\nwith all our treasure, and with such a cargo, take our goods and our\nmoney and our jewels together, as, I believed, was never brought into\nthe city by two single men, since the state of Venice had a being.\n\nWe kept ourselves here _incognito_ for a great while, passing for two\nArmenian merchants still, as we had done before; and by this time we had\ngotten so much of the Persian and Armenian jargon, which they talked at\nBassorah and Bagdad, and everywhere that we came in the country, as\nwas sufficient to make us able to talk to one another, so as not to be\nunderstood by anybody, though sometimes hardly by ourselves.\n\nHere we converted all our effects into money, settled our abode as for\na considerable time, and William and I, maintaining an inviolable\nfriendship and fidelity to one another, lived like two brothers; we\nneither had or sought any separate interest; we conversed seriously and\ngravely, and upon the subject of our repentance continually; we never\nchanged, that is to say, so as to leave off our Armenian garbs; and we\nwere called, at Venice, the two Grecians.\n\nI had been two or three times going to give a detail of our wealth, but\nit will appear incredible, and we had the greatest difficulty in the\nworld how to conceal it, being justly apprehensive lest we might be\nassassinated in that country for our treasure. At length William told me\nhe began to think now that he must never see England any more, and\nthat indeed he did not much concern himself about it; but seeing we had\ngained so great wealth, and he had some poor relations in England, if\nI was willing, he would write to know if they were living, and to know\nwhat condition they were in, and if he found such of them were alive\nas he had some thoughts about, he would, with my consent, send them\nsomething to better their condition.\n\nI consented most willingly; and accordingly William wrote to a sister\nand an uncle, and in about five weeks' time received an answer from them\nboth, directed to himself, under cover of a hard Armenian name that\nhe had given himself, viz., Signore Constantine Alexion of Ispahan, at\nVenice.\n\nIt was a very moving letter he received from his sister, who, after the\nmost passionate expressions of joy to hear he was alive, seeing she had\nlong ago had an account that he was murdered by the pirates in the West\nIndies, entreats him to let her know what circumstances he was in; tells\nhim she was not in any capacity to do anything considerable for him, but\nthat he should be welcome to her with all her heart; that she was left\na widow, with four children, but kept a little shop in the Minories, by\nwhich she made shift to maintain her family; and that she had sent him\nfive pounds, lest he should want money, in a strange country, to bring\nhim home.\n\nI could see the letter brought tears out of his eyes as he read it; and,\nindeed, when he showed it to me, and the little bill for five pounds,\nupon an English merchant in Venice, it brought tears out of my eyes too.\n\nAfter we had been both affected sufficiently with the tenderness and\nkindness of this letter, he turns to me; says he, \"What shall I do for\nthis poor woman?\" I mused a while; at last says I, \"I will tell you what\nyou shall do for her. She has sent you five pounds, and she has four\nchildren, and herself, that is five; such a sum, from a poor woman in\nher circumstances, is as much as five thousand pounds is to us; you\nshall send her a bill of exchange for five thousand pounds English\nmoney, and bid her conceal her surprise at it till she hears from you\nagain; but bid her leave off her shop, and go and take a house somewhere\nin the country, not far off from London, and stay there, in a moderate\nfigure, till she hears from you again.\"\n\n\"Now,\" says William, \"I perceive by it that you have some thoughts of\nventuring into England.\"\n\n\"Indeed, William,\" said I, \"you mistake me; but it presently occurred to\nme that you should venture, for what have you done that you may not be\nseen there? Why should I desire to keep you from your relations, purely\nto keep me company?\"\n\nWilliam looked very affectionately upon me. \"Nay,\" says he, \"we have\nembarked together so long, and come together so far, I am resolved I\nwill never part with thee as long as I live, go where thou wilt, or stay\nwhere thou wilt; and as for my sister,\" said William, \"I cannot send her\nsuch a sum of money, for whose is all this money we have? It is most of\nit thine.\"\n\n\"No, William,\" said I, \"there is not a penny of it mine but what is\nyours too, and I won't have anything but an equal share with you, and\ntherefore you shall send it to her; if not, I will send it.\"\n\n\"Why,\" says William, \"it will make the poor woman distracted; she will\nbe so surprised she will go out of her wits.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said I, \"William, you may do it prudently; send her a bill\nbacked of a hundred pounds, and bid her expect more in a post or two,\nand that you will send her enough to live on without keeping shop, and\nthen send her more.\"\n\nAccordingly William sent her a very kind letter, with a bill upon a\nmerchant in London for a hundred and sixty pounds, and bid her comfort\nherself with the hope that he should be able in a little time to send\nher more. About ten days after, he sent her another bill of five hundred\nand forty pounds; and a post or two after, another for three hundred\npounds, making in all a thousand pounds; and told her he would send her\nsufficient to leave off her shop, and directed her to take a house as\nabove.\n\nHe waited then till he received an answer to all the three letters, with\nan account that she had received the money, and, which I did not expect,\nthat she had not let any other acquaintance know that she had received\na shilling from anybody, or so much as that he was alive, and would not\ntill she had heard again.\n\nWhen he showed me this letter, \"Well, William,\" said I, \"this woman is\nfit to be trusted with life or anything; send her the rest of the five\nthousand pounds, and I'll venture to England with you, to this woman's\nhouse, whenever you will.\"\n\nIn a word, we sent her five thousand pounds in good bills; and she\nreceived them very punctually, and in a little time sent her brother\nword that she had pretended to her uncle that she was sickly and could\nnot carry on the trade any longer, and that she had taken a large house\nabout four miles from London, under pretence of letting lodgings for\nher livelihood; and, in short, intimated as if she understood that he\nintended to come over to be _incognito_, assuring him he should be as\nretired as he pleased.\n\nThis was opening the very door for us that we thought had been\neffectually shut for this life; and, in a word, we resolved to venture,\nbut to keep ourselves entirely concealed, both as to name and every\nother circumstance; and accordingly William sent his sister word how\nkindly he took her prudent steps, and that she had guessed right that\nhe desired to be retired, and that he obliged her not to increase her\nfigure, but live private, till she might perhaps see him.\n\nHe was going to send the letter away. \"Come, William,\" said I, \"you\nshan't send her an empty letter; tell her you have a friend coming with\nyou that must be as retired as yourself, and I'll send her five thousand\npounds more.\"\n\nSo, in short, we made this poor woman's family rich; and yet, when it\ncame to the point, my heart failed me, and I durst not venture; and for\nWilliam, he would not stir without me; and so we stayed about two years\nafter this, considering what we should do.\n\nYou may think, perhaps, that I was very prodigal of my ill-gotten goods,\nthus to load a stranger with my bounty, and give a gift like a prince to\none that had been able to merit nothing of me, or indeed know me; but\nmy condition ought to be considered in this case; though I had money to\nprofusion, yet I was perfectly destitute of a friend in the world, to\nhave the least obligation or assistance from, or knew not either where\nto dispose or trust anything I had while I lived, or whom to give it to\nif I died.\n\nWhen I had reflected upon the manner of my getting of it, I was\nsometimes for giving it all to charitable uses, as a debt due to\nmankind, though I was no Roman Catholic, and not at all of the opinion\nthat it would purchase me any repose to my soul; but I thought, as it\nwas got by a general plunder, and which I could make no satisfaction\nfor, it was due to the community, and I ought to distribute it for the\ngeneral good. But still I was at a loss how, and where, and by whom to\nsettle this charity, not daring to go home to my own country, lest some\nof my comrades, strolled home, should see and detect me, and for the\nvery spoil of my money, or the purchase of his own pardon, betray and\nexpose me to an untimely end.\n\nBeing thus destitute, I say, of a friend, I pitched thus upon William's\nsister; the kind step of hers to her brother, whom she thought to be in\ndistress, signifying a generous mind and a charitable disposition; and\nhaving resolved to make her the object of my first bounty, I did not\ndoubt but I should purchase something of a refuge for myself, and a kind\nof a centre, to which I should tend in my future actions; for really\na man that has a subsistence, and no residence, no place that has a\nmagnetic influence upon his affections, is in one of the most odd,\nuneasy conditions in the world, nor is it in the power of all his money\nto make it up to him.\n\nIt was, as I told you, two years and upwards that we remained at Venice\nand thereabout, in the greatest hesitation imaginable, irresolute and\nunfixed to the last degree. William's sister importuned us daily to come\nto England, and wondered we should not dare to trust her, whom we had to\nsuch a degree obliged to be faithful; and in a manner lamented her being\nsuspected by us.\n\nAt last I began to incline; and I said to William, \"Come, brother\nWilliam,\" said I (for ever since our discourse at Bassorah I called him\nbrother), \"if you will agree to two or three things with me, I'll go\nhome to England with all my heart.\"\n\nSays William, \"Let me know what they are.\"\n\n\"Why, first,\" says I, \"you shall not disclose yourself to any of your\nrelations in England but your sister--no, not one; secondly, we will\nnot shave off our mustachios or beards\" (for we had all along worn our\nbeards after the Grecian manner), \"nor leave off our long vests, that we\nmay pass for Grecians and foreigners; thirdly, that we shall never speak\nEnglish in public before anybody, your sister excepted; fourthly, that\nwe will always live together and pass for brothers.\"\n\nWilliam said he would agree to them all with all his heart, but that the\nnot speaking English would be the hardest, but he would do his best for\nthat too; so, in a word, we agreed to go from Venice to Naples, where we\nconverted a large sum of money into bales of silk, left a large sum in a\nmerchant's hands at Venice, and another considerable sum at Naples, and\ntook bills of exchange for a great deal too; and yet we came with such\na cargo to London as few American merchants had done for some years,\nfor we loaded in two ships seventy-three bales of thrown silk, besides\nthirteen bales of wrought silks, from the duchy of Milan, shipped at\nGenoa, with all which I arrived safely; and some time after I married my\nfaithful protectress, William's sister, with whom I am much more happy\nthan I deserve.\n\nAnd now, having so plainly told you that I am come to England, after I\nhave so boldly owned what life I have led abroad, it is time to leave\noff, and say no more for the present, lest some should be willing to\ninquire too nicely after your old friend CAPTAIN BOB.\n\n\n[Transcriber's Note: The words \"thae\" (Scottish dialect for \"those\") and\n\"Geat Mogul\" (\"Great\" may be meant) do occur as such in the print copy.]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Life, Adventures and Piracies of\nthe Famous Captain Singleton, by Daniel Defoe\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK CAPTAIN SINGLETON ***\n\n***** This file should be named 6422.txt or 6422.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/6\/4\/2\/6422\/\n\nProduced by Tom Allen, Charles Franks and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org\n\n\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit www.gutenberg.org\/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":26,"split":"train"}
